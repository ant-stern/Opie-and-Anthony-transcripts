<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM radio show broadcast began with a triumphant recap of their massive rock and roll comedy show at the PNC Arts Center in New Jersey, attended by over 12,000 people.  Opie, Anthony, and James Norton detailed the extensive pre-show tailgating, describing a massive party in the rest area and parking lot filled with tents, barbecues, beer pong, and general revelry.  Norton’s mooning of the crowd from a golf cart driven by “Soda Kenny” sparked a contagious wave of similar antics from the audience.  The hosts showcased numerous fan-submitted photos and videos from the event available online.  The comedy lineup included Otto, George, Tracy Morgan, Bob Kelly, Bob Saget, Patrice O'Neal, and the hosts themselves.  A recurring bit, “Stalker Patty,” was discussed, culminating in Patty being crowned "Miss O&A Traveling Virus" and drenched in pig's blood.  Technical difficulties with their video playback, now a part of their act, were also mentioned.  Listener calls included one recounting lighting a fart on fire during the show, and another comparing the event to a Giant Stadium rock concert.  A somber shift in tone followed, as they discussed a tragic murder-suicide involving two PalTalk users who met through their online community, highlighting the unexpected consequences of their show's close-knit fanbase.  The show concluded with promotion of their upcoming Philadelphia show.  Robert Reed and Bobby Kelly were mentioned as guests, with Kelly expected later in the broadcast.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about a listener's friend witnessing a murder-suicide possibly connected to the show's audience.  This led to a conversation about heartbreak and breakups, with Opie graphically detailing his own extreme emotional distress following a breakup, including suicidal thoughts and a bizarre attempt to break his own arm with a baseball bat.  He used highly offensive language to describe the behavior of possessive men.  Bob Kelly joined the show in studio, sharing a poem about a breakup which the hosts mocked. The conversation continued with offensive and crude language surrounding breakups and heartbreak.  Kelly recounted a successful comedy show (with exaggerated attendance numbers) and a humorous anecdote involving a police officer who, after giving Kelly a ride and letting him use the police loudspeaker to promote his show, ejected him from the vehicle.  Opie then shared a story about his Outer Banks vacation, including witnessing endangered sea turtle nesting and hatching, his somewhat callous reaction, encountering wild horses, and his less-than-stellar boogie boarding skills compared to some twelve-year-old girls.  The segment included jokes about Dick Clark’s Emmy appearance and a listener email criticizing their views on endangered species.  Ralphie May was mentioned as a future guest.

The next segment opened with jokes about 9/11 conspiracy theories and a morbidly humorous hypothetical involving Ralphie May and buried gay pornography.  Bob Kelly, again in studio, discussed his stand-up gigs and apologized for a previously misattributed joke.  The hosts engaged in an offensive discussion about turtles, comparing them to AIDS.  Kelly recounted a physical altercation with Jay Davis, involving slaps, during an on-air appearance on Fox 25, further fueled by Kelly's repeated inappropriate mention of John Carr, a convicted child murderer.  Offensive jokes and references to John Carr continued throughout the segment.  The conversation shifted to Dane Cook's success, Opie expressing a mix of admiration and resentment.  The hosts criticized Conan O'Brien's Emmy opening skit and Dick Clark's Emmy appearance, using offensive language.  A caller, "Scheduled Rape," commented on the show, and Kelly discussed his dual identity, often confused with R. Kelly.  The segment concluded with discussion of the studio's mirrored ceiling, more offensive jokes, and a caller interrupting with off-topic comments.  Bob Kelly and Ralphie May were in the studio.

A segment focused on Jimmy's romantic relationship and struggles with intimacy and commitment.  He expressed concerns about ruining his current relationship due to past behavior and addictive tendencies, detailing past sexual behavior, struggles with sex addiction, and the role of pornography in his life.  His weight loss efforts ("Fat Smash") and subsequent relapse were discussed. He linked his anxieties about intimacy and commitment to past trauma or dysfunctional childhood experiences.  Other topics included complaints about the studio's mirrored ceiling and lighting, a phone call with Elo, reviews of show replays, and a possible upcoming 10k run.  Ralphie May and Bob Kelly were in the studio.  Crude and vulgar language was frequent.

Another segment heavily featured discussions of sex and relationships, with a caller, Jimmy, revealing struggles with intimacy and addiction.  The hosts and callers openly discussed various sexual acts and preferences, using vulgar and sexually explicit language. The desire for "dirty" sex was contrasted with idealized romantic notions in media.  Listeners shared experiences, one describing using Lucky Louie to initiate intimacy and a female caller detailing her experiences with bondage.  A remotely diagnosing psychotherapist labeled Jimmy with a fear of intimacy, which the hosts and a caller discussed.  The discussion then shifted to Bob Kelly's snuba diving experience, recounted with exaggerated details and crude humor.  Bob Kelly and Ralphie May were in the studio.  The segment concluded with more calls, sexual innuendo, and continued discussion of Kelly’s snuba diving story.

The final excerpt began with a discussion of an upcoming appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, featuring Julian Moore, and the hosts' busy schedules.  The conversation quickly devolved into offensive and vulgar territory, including homophobic and racist jokes about Mayor Nagin and a graphic anecdote about an uncircumcised man in a sauna.  Numerous homophobic slurs and graphic sexual descriptions were used. A caller mentioned Otto making jokes about Katrina victims. The conversation then shifted to a recent comedy show, complaints about promotional items, and a woman flashing her breasts on stage.  This transitioned into a discussion about Girls Gone Wild videos, punctuated by further vulgar language.  The hosts discussed upcoming shows and personal appearances, interspersed with more offensive jokes.  The broadcast ended abruptly due to the hosts realizing they were on the air longer than expected.  Gavin, a studio guest, was described in physically threatening terms based on perceived ethnicity and accent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Beings in the country. Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Vacation is over.  Yes.  I'm glad I need a schedule.  Do ya?  I do.  I need a workout schedule.  Yeah, it was a little rough.  Wake up, mother effers. 
[00:01:30]  Wake up.  Would have been bad enough if it was just vacation.  But then we come back from vacation a day early so we can put on an extravaganza.  A rock and roll comedy show.  A rock and roll comedy show.  It certainly was.  Punchline magazine is calling it a rock show.  It was.  It was more a rock show than a comedy show as far as the people went, as far as the crowd, 
[00:02:00]  the tailgating.  Unbelievable.  Never seen anything like it except for when you're, you know, you're at a rock show.  I was meeting you guys here at four o'clock.  I guess we weren't sure what we were going to do video-wise or whatever.  And I could not believe there were people in the rest area on the way to the show.  And then we'd get to the venue and there's people out there drinking with tents up.  Yeah.  There were tents and huge barbecues making sausage.  Beer pong.  Steaks. 
[00:02:30]  Beer pong was set up in the parking lot.  Yeah.  Tents and coverage because everyone thought it was going to rain.  A lot of signs all over the place.  Of course, we're talking about the O&A traveling virus that hit the PNC Arts Center in Jersey  on Saturday night.  And there were over 12,000 people there.  Yeah.  For a comedy show.  Unbelievable.  The biggest O&A event ever.  Ever, ever.  And we've been at this a while now.  And we've noticed about a year ago that the O.P. and Anthony thing is starting to become 
[00:03:00]  like this lifestyle thing.  Yeah.  Doesn't end after the show's over.  Doesn't end after the show.  Doesn't end before the show.  I mean, it starts way before the show, I should say.  Friendships are being made.  People are getting married.  They're having kids now.  And that was very, very apparent at the PNC in the parking lot.  But it was just a huge party.  This group of people getting along with this group of people.  You know, newbies trying to work their way into some of the groups. 
[00:03:30]  It was just amazing.  There's clicks.  It was just amazing.  And like Jimmy said, they started partying at a rest area on the way to the PNC Arts Center  because I guess there was word that the parking lot wasn't open until about 3.30.  And what, the gate opened at 5.30?  Yeah.  And they're like, that's not good enough for us.  We need more than just two hours in a parking lot so we could all hang before the show.  Kenny took care of that.  So Kenny got the venue to open up the parking lot at what, like 12.30, 1 o'clock? 
[00:04:00]  Originally it was scheduled doors 5.30, parking lot 3.30.  That wasn't good enough for our fans.  So I got it to open 1.30, and they still, the party animals, had to stop at the Cheesequake rest area  and party for a couple hours before that.  They could have went inside the bathroom and had a real party in that rest area.  Buddy.  You got tickets?  Buddy.  What are you doing in there?  There are hundreds and hundreds of pictures all over the internet. 
[00:04:30]  Go to opianthony.com.  That's a great place to start.  Whackbag.com has just a ton of pictures.  Yeah.  The FBA site, I don't know if we're allowed to promote it officially because of the name.  Go to opianthony.com, and under one of the links, it's another great fan site, FBA,  but it's whatfbastandsfor.com.  There's another one that goes to the same site.  It's safe for work.  I know.  I forgot the name.  What is it?  Anyone remember?  Don't know.  O&A Experience?  Maybe O&A Experience.  Yeah, I think that's it.  And I was looking at some of the pictures, and there they are in a rest area with their huge 
[00:05:00]  banner, group picture, they're partying and grilling at a rest area, and then they finally  got into the parking lot, and we went around the parking lot.  I could not believe how many people were there and how much fun they were having hours before  the show.  Our little golf cart ride.  Well, you've got to bring the video in.  Yeah.  We don't have a good video of that yet.  We played it at the PNC Arts Center, but basically, me and Jimmy jumped on a golf cart  driven by our own club, Soda Kenny, and we went up and down every row to say hi to all 
[00:05:30]  the fans that showed up very early.  And then Jimmy, we needed a video for the event, and Jimmy nailed it.  All of a sudden, we're on the golf cart, and people are losing their minds because we're  just having fun, and they're screaming.  We're screaming back at them.  And then Jimmy decides to moon the parking lot, and the video is hilarious.  Ant was videotaping.  We were able to pass it to the cart behind us, and we got just great video of Jimmy mooning  everybody. 
[00:06:00]  I was wearing my boxer briefs, which are white, and it looked like I had on tighty-lighty  diapers.  It was so...  Because my ass...  It's basically a work of art.  It's like a soft, childlike thing.  And right below it are my stupid underwears hanging, and it's like down to mid-thin.  Thigh.  It was kind of pushing your cheeks up a little bit.  Oh, it was perfect.  It was like two little loving hands just holding them, presenting them for every queer in the  parking lot.  I haven't laughed that hard, Jimmy.  I got to tell you.  Oh, I was cracking up.  Because then you inspired the crowd. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  So then the more aisles we went up and down, the more people decided they had to then  pull their pants down and show the crowd.  Some people running right in front of the golf cart, jiggling their big fatness right  in front of us.  Very interactive crowd.  So there were a few thousand in the parking lot way, way, way before the show.  And like I said, I was amazed because I thought it was going to rain.  So I figured most people would wait for the last minute, park their car, and get into  the show. 
[00:07:00]  But they said, screw the rain.  They had tarps up just in case.  And like we said, they were grilling everything in sight and just partying and having a good  time, well-behaved.  Yeah.  It kind of had the feel of like a very, very mini Grateful Dead thing in the parking lot.  Yeah.  But with, I think, more animals.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they like their beer and their crystal meth instead of their pot and acid.  There's some still picks up on Foundry.  I'm looking at one right now of Jimmy's butt just hanging out. 
[00:07:30]  Kenny's driving.  You're in the front of the cart, right?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm hanging on the left side with my ass hanging out and Opa's sitting right next  to me.  And my pants are down to my ankles.  And it just looks like it wasn't meant to happen.  It looks like it happened accidentally and I'm too scared to like reach down and pull  them up.  Yeah, like you had to get away from a situation.  So you jumped on the back of this thing and it's an emergency and your pants fell down.  But you're too concerned about the emergency to notice your pants are down. 
[00:08:00]  Maybe that was the emergency.  Maybe I was just being raped and thank God a couple of golfers fell by and picked me up  from the cart.  Like Tiger Woods had his club and some lube out.  Well, what a great time at the PNC Arts Center.  Like I said, the biggest ONA event ever.  Ever.  I don't know if we're going to ever beat that one.  Over 12,000 people.  And it really went off without a hitch.  Somebody on one of the message boards said, hey, I like how you guys are pulling the bit  of how you can't get your video to work when you first try it. 
[00:08:30]  Because, you know, we try to get the video work and you'll hear the audio and not get a video  or the wrong video will play.  But, you know, if that's the only glitch we get the whole night, that's great.  But people are starting to think that's a bit now.  Yeah.  And the ONA audiences, these comedy, considering they are amazing comedy audiences, man.  Yeah.  It's like they, everyone did well.  Yep.  Everyone did well.  There was not one bad set throughout the night.  And believe me, they're brutally honest.  If somebody sucks, you will hear booze. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, we're not just BSing here.  You can go to whackbag.com and the other fan sites and they'll give you the review of the show.  Yeah.  They're honest about it.  And the review is well over 90%.  Well over 90% of the people that are talking about the show loved every single part of it.  I was worried if I was even going to be able to talk today.  Oof.  I woke up yesterday.  I was like, I had to call Kenny.  I'm like, hi, Kenny.  Kenny, it's Anthony.  Could you come and get us? 
[00:09:30]  We're ready to leave.  It's three o'clock in the afternoon.  Thank God.  Thank God the hotel was cool.  I didn't get up until like two.  There's no way.  Oh.  Got to keep that wine out of the dressing room.  Your goblets of wine.  I had this huge wine glass and kept filling it up.  Yeah.  You looked a little creepy.  I got to be all right.  Driving around with this giant wine glass.  A big goblet of wine as he's waving to the fans of the parking lot.  From the golf cart.  I had, yeah, the big glass. 
[00:10:00]  And I was waving.  People are saying, that's a fancy man.  All I'm thinking is, where are our critics now?  Because we don't look like shock jocks with Anthony with this goblet of red wine.  A big goblet.  I was pimping.  The Opie and Henry VIII show.  Hey, real fast.  Let's see what a tool I am.  Phones are lit already.  Let's say hi to TunaPhone from PalTalk.  TunaPhone, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's happening? 
[00:10:30]  Best show in the world, guys.  I was in the second row.  I chewed a dice in the water.  I was the guy that chewed the water.  I was sitting behind Master Poe.  He almost chopped me in the head after I chewed the water up to you.  Perfect throw, my friend.  Thank you.  Yeah, Anthony needed water for his Andrew Dice gay bit.  I guess you were the one who threw it up there.  And there was a commotion backstage when he threw the water.  I was like, oh, my God, Anthony can't drink that water.  Where did he get it?  He's got to have water from backstage.  It was sealed.  I punch one slide right to you.  And then I lit my fart.  Remember with Sag on the stage?  I was the guy with the fart lighter. 
[00:11:00]  You lit your gasser?  Yeah, I lit my ass up on fire, man.  Wait, you were lighting farts?  Sag it.  He was telling me not to light my fart.  I was sitting in the second, third row right behind Master Poe.  Only hippies loped and joined around all these friggin' people.  See, these are the things I want to hear.  I didn't know someone was lighting their farts in the audience during the show.  Well, he asked.  Sag it asked.  All right.  Thank you, Tuna Fo.  And Master Poe was sitting right in the front row.  Yes, gentlemen.  I was glad while I was on stage to look down and see him there, to be honest.  It was good to have one person in the audience you knew. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I was in PNC security.  And this maniac is wearing a three-piece suit.  Yeah.  I'm like, he's the only guy that would show up to an event where you might have to fistfight  in the mud wearing a suit.  But he's not worried about getting it dirty.  No, it wouldn't get dirty.  Because he would take most of the suit off, take his time before he kicked your ass.  He would still have plenty of time.  Because he also had a cane with him.  I didn't see that.  And it was completely for fighting, I think.  Yeah.  I don't think he had any leg problems.  Right. 
[00:12:00]  He just had that just in case he had to kick some ass and keep his suit clean.  He wanted to sing T for two as he ripped somebody's throat out.  How good was Otto and George?  How good was Otto and George to start the show as everyone was still filing in?  It was amazing.  The show started with Voss went up and was just killed as always.  It's what he does on stages like that, man.  And then Otto.  Otto was a last-minute addition, which is why he was on early.  No one knew where to put him because he just was thrown on at the end.  And he murdered comics who have been watching, I don't know, 15 years. 
[00:12:30]  That's what he does.  And I haven't seen him that great in a long time because it was just so good to see him.  Pumped up in front of that many people and everyone just loving it, screaming.  He hammers, man.  He is just a machine.  When he's on like that, he is just devastating to watch.  And just an awful human being to have that stuff come out of that puppet.  You know what he is?  He's a pig.  I'm trying to think of more of the highlights, but it was just amazing. 
[00:13:00]  Tracy was great.  After Otto was Tracy, which I would never want to go on after Otto.  I wouldn't allow it.  And Tracy didn't care.  Yeah.  Morgan did great.  And let me see if I can remember.  After Morgan was Bob Kelly.  Am I correct?  Who killed.  And after Bob Kelly was Saget.  And everybody knows what Saget does.  Yeah.  And after Saget.  No, everyone doesn't know what Saget does still.  Even though we've been pumping it for about a month, the guy is probably the dirtiest guy 
[00:13:30]  in there.  I mean, his response.  Oh, his day.  He killed.  He absolutely killed.  Killed.  And then you guys come out.  We did the Stalker Patty bit.  Yeah.  Which horrified people.  Yeah, to do it.  I was getting reports that women were biting their nails right off their fingers.  I think because everyone saw it coming except for Patty.  Except, yeah.  Because I was reading somebody on Whackbag, I think, saying, oh, it was a hacked bit because  everyone knew it was coming. 
[00:14:00]  That's the beauty of it.  Freaking Patty doesn't know it's coming time and time again.  That's the only thing that matters is that she doesn't know it's coming.  You're in on the joke as the audience because you've seen Carrie and you're not five-year-old  mentality like she is.  I can't believe how we talked her up to the point where she really believed that she was  being crowned some type of ONA virus princess.  Yeah, we wanted to do this for many years and we finally pulled it off.  Yeah, we crowned her Miss ONA Traveling Virus for the PNC show. 
[00:14:30]  She bought right into it.  And by the way, backstage there was a panic because just before we came out to do the bit,  I'm like, where's Patty's gown?  Where's her tiara?  All of a sudden, I see a freaking king's crown.  Brought out a big crown.  Why did you get a king's crown?  But then there was a tiara, thank God, because I was in a panic.  I'm like, oh my God.  No, I had alternate props.  Ah, he's good.  Yeah, I had a backup.  Why?  In case we got a tranny instead of Patty? 
[00:15:00]  What's the matter with you?  She's so prepared.  So then, you know, she had to sit in her little throne.  Yeah.  And we gave her her cape and we gave her her tiara.  We gave her the roses.  We had glitter, all kinds of glittery stuff in these cups that we were throwing around the stage.  And she was so happy to be crowned Miss ONA Traveling Virus.  Sat there.  We talked about how she had been loyal to the show for so many years and that she deserved this.  And the crowd was giving her just a standing ovation. 
[00:15:30]  It was amazing.  And perched precariously above her head, high in the rafters.  I'm like, how is this going to work?  But I guess they were practicing it for hours before we got there.  Yeah.  To make sure it was going to work.  Yeah.  And it was the pig's blood.  Yeah, the blood from above.  Five-gallon bucket.  Five gallons of blood pouring down on Stalk and Patty in front of 12,000 plus people.  Bringing that Carrie moment to life where she was all happy with herself for a second. 
[00:16:00]  And we got the perfect reaction.  A lot of laughs.  A lot of boos and a lot of...  And then I was laughing so hard.  I just walked off the stage.  Anthony walked off the stage.  And there she is just awkwardly standing in front of everybody.  Standing there, soaked.  She doesn't know what to do next.  I guess the video is up on YouTube.  YouTube.com is great.  Our own Sam is putting videos up there.  This is what I love. 
[00:16:30]  You go to YouTube.com, search our names, Opie and Anthony.  There are a lot of videos for the PNC Arts Center show.  And what I love about that is that these guys got their cameras in there and they bootlegged it.  Because we cannot play you even clips from our own comedy show on our radio show.  No?  No, we're not allowed to.  Really?  There's probably more...  Yeah, the PNC, they want to charge you for that, of course.  Right.  So we can't sit here and give you a quick highlight of Andrew Dice Gay or Otto and George or Jim Norton or Patrice O'Neil. 
[00:17:00]  But it was us.  Or the Stalker Patty thing that we just explained would be great to give you just a piece of audio.  But why can't we?  It was us.  I'm guessing something to do with commercial use.  You can videotape it for your own use.  They won't stop you from keeping it to archive it for yourself as a performer.  But there's something to do with where you have to pay a massive fee.  Right.  There's an origination fee because it's a union house.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Why wouldn't it be?  You have to pay for the unions, apparently.  I don't know why.  So thank God we have some of the greatest fans.  Some. 
[00:17:30]  We got the greatest fans in radio.  They got a lot of clips.  They have started throwing them up on YouTube, YouTube.com.  Sam has thrown them up on YouTube.com.  You can find the Stalker Patty thing.  Eventually, you'll find the video of Jimmy's mooting of the crowd in the parking lot.  Yeah.  And there's clips of everyone performing.  There's a clip of Jimmy up there already.  There's a clip of Bob Saget up there already.  Patrice O'Neill.  Bob Kelly.  Just about everyone.  I think they even have Otto and George up there. 
[00:18:00]  A little video clip.  I hope so.  So check that out for yourself on YouTube.com.  All right?  Otto murdered.  I was really happy.  I mean, I knew he would kill.  I mean, it's not a doubt.  It's just great to see him in a huge place like that with a bunch of people, you know?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Vinny in Jersey.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Listen, I was there with my kid.  There's no way you're going to be able to explain how huge this was.  I was trying to explain it to my wife.  It was like being at an old Giant Stadium rock concert. 
[00:18:30]  I can't believe there was a comedy event.  Yeah.  There were guys sitting 200 yards away, and they were in the – it was packed.  I can't believe it.  Yeah.  The people on the lawn were having a great time, even though there was that misty rain  and kind of coming down.  They didn't care.  Got pretty lucky with the weather, yeah.  We got real lucky.  Because then after the show, we were signing autographs and stuff, and pretty much right  down to the last autograph and picture, and then it just – it started raining.  Yeah, it started pouring.  But that's when it finally started raining for sure. 
[00:19:00]  And there were some people that were waiting that didn't get stuff signed.  And we'll explain that at one point today.  We just thought – I thought we were being hustled out.  I know I thought the same thing and stayed and actually signed a little bit more.  But we thought we were being hustled out by the – the event was kicking us out.  Yeah.  That was huge.  Yeah.  Huge.  The whole thing was huge.  It was like this Punchline magazine, they did a review, and they're calling it the O&A  Circus came to town because they were tailgating. 
[00:19:30]  Then we had the O&A Village that had all these great events going on, and then the comedy  show.  It was just – and then they were partying after the show in the parking lot.  They finally had to kick him out of the parking lot.  It was just unbelievable.  That clown was also a huge hit, that clown.  That knucklehead was a huge hit.  Oh, was he good?  Oh, good, because he sucked in Worcester.  No, he was huge.  He couldn't even get over by that guy.  Oh, good.  No, the Village was much better at the PNC than the Village at the DCU Center in Worcester,  because we had to do it indoors in Worcester. 
[00:20:00]  This was made for outdoors.  You're never going to describe to the audience, unless they were there, how humongous – I  still can't believe it.  I'm in shock that that was a comedy event.  Well, dude, I was too, because comedy is not meant to be done like that.  Comedy is something you do in front of a few hundred people, and you need the conditions  right, because laughs are just different than rock.  If you're talking during a Kiss concert, it's cool, but if you're talking during comedy,  you're missing it, and you look like it stinks.  And the fans were amazing, man.  This was something that we came up with years ago.  We weren't sure how it was going to work. 
[00:20:30]  Like Jimmy said, I mean, to get 12,000 people for a comedy show, you don't know what's going  to happen if you can get their attention.  But right to the end, with Carlos Mencia, people were laughing their asses off.  Four hours.  A four-hour freaking show.  They're laughing all the way to the end.  That was the second half of the show.  Oh, when they came back out.  I'm sorry about to interrupt you.  Oh, when they came back out, what you guys did was, you did Andrew Dice Gay as soon as  the break was over, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then it was, Patrice came out, and it was great.  Did you see your video of Andrew Dice Gay?  Yes, I did. 
[00:21:00]  When you squirted your...  When I had to, yes, I had to actually take the bottle of water as if it was something else.  And yeah, I kind of sprayed my ass.  And then when you were finished, you turned around and posed so everybody could see the  jacket.  The giant wet spot right on my ass.  I went all out.  Well, that picture's up on...  Well, that video's up on YouTube as well. 
[00:21:30]  Anthony as Andrew Dice Gay.  What a great way to get back at that ass.  Yeah, there it is.  Yeah, there is the picture.  It's wet right there at ground zero.  And you still look better than I did in my stupid diaper underwear.  And, uh, okay, so you do Dice Gay, Patrice comes out, and then it was Bill Burr, it was  myself, and Mencia.  Yeah.  Mencia did like 35 minutes, which was the maximum, because we had a curfew. 
[00:22:00]  We had to be out by 11 o'clock, or...  Again.  You cannot, yeah.  Again, more union stuff.  Of course, of course, because the unions...  I mean, look, they do a lot in this country, we do need unions, but there's times where  they just become aggravating.  And, uh, Mencia just murdered.  I mean, murdered.  And, of course, Jimmy won't say anything about himself, but I will tell you something.  I was happy with my shit, dude.  I was happy.  You walk out there, and, uh, the people just go BS on you.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, I'm very happy with this.  Crowd loves Jimmy.  And the fact that, uh, you know, the way I came out with Club Soda, Kenny cradling me. 
[00:22:30]  Yes, that was a nice thought.  Oh, that's right.  Kenny carried Jimmy out onto the stage cradling you.  Like a little baby.  Yeah, like a baby.  We tried it in Houston, because when I used to tour Dice and Kenny was the road manager,  I always, one time, wanted Kenny to carry me on stage with me wearing diapers and a baby  bonnet.  I'm like, I just want him to carry me on stage like that, put me in front of the mic,  let me do my 15 minutes, not acknowledge what I'm wearing, and then walk off stage.  Yeah.  I can't do it now. 
[00:23:00]  You can't do 45 in a diaper.  No.  Um, but I said in Houston, just please carry me out, and he did, and it was so safe feeling.  It was kind of safe slash sexy and homoerotic.  Big man, big arms.  Let's go to Doug out, Doug.  Hey, Doug.  Good morning.  Hi, Doug.  Hey, Doug.  What a great show you guys put on, man.  I don't think there was much that went wrong that night.  That was probably one of the greatest parties I've ever heard of.  You know that we had, like, literally one miscue on a dumb video we had to play? 
[00:23:30]  That was pretty much it.  Everything else worked perfectly?  Yeah, I remember that when you guys tried to go to the video the first time.  I love when you guys got to eat crow.  It's just hilarious when you got to do that, but that worked out fine anyway.  Yeah, it's going to happen occasionally, man.  I mean, it's like, you know, whatever, it's not a show.  It's like, yeah, when something sucks, I just tell you, that sucked.  But it worked out.  It was fixed.  Hey, Doug, thanks for the pest booth.  You guys did a great job.  Oh, thank you, man.  Except for the one little problem I think I emailed you about. 
[00:24:00]  Everything out there went absolutely awesome.  We had women that were just showing everybody what they wanted to see out at the pest booth.  They would dip those little imitation babies in the water, and then they would stand up,  and they would show us what feeds babies, and everybody was happy out there.  Yeah, there was a lot of wowing and nudity in the parking lot, by the way.  We should point that out as well.  You know, for all you people out there that don't think this Whip-em-Out Wednesday thing doesn't work,  go to an O&A event. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Go to an O&A event.  Well, they were doing the – you guys had the Yates Challenge, right, set up?  Yeah, we had the Yates Challenge and the Chester Kickoff.  The Yates Challenge is pretty much a takeoff on a wet T-shirt contest,  because when the ladies do this in a T-shirt, their T-shirt gets completely wet.  Now, you know what the Yates Challenge is, right?  There's – what did you use this time?  Was it balls or –  Yeah, we had five of those, like, kid balls, so they're not small. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  Yeah.  And what you're to do is to hold them, see if you can hold them all underwater.  In a big tub of water.  In a big bathtub full of water.  Is it a real bathtub?  No, it's just like these big tubs.  You know, big.  Okay.  Like a bathtub size.  Yeah.  And kind of hold them down, and then the girls come up,  and their whole front is completely soaked.  So you get, like, a wet T-shirt contest.  So it adds a little fun into that whole tragedy of a woman drowning five of her children. 
[00:25:30]  The Yates Challenge.  The Yates Challenge.  What was the dog thing?  You guys –  The Chester Kickoff, Opie.  To see how far someone could kick Chester?  No, we had three stuffed dogs,  and what we had set up was one of those freestanding soccer stands  that had, like, the three holes in it with the flaps over it,  and what you had to do was you had to get two dogs kicked through the holes,  and you went to a T-shirt.  We had –  Actually, I mean, we had Cage from one of the Photoshop guys on one of the websites. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  He made a T-shirt design for us, so we had exclusive shirts out there,  and people were just going crazy over those.  Cage did an awesome job, as usual.  He had a traveling virus pest boost T-shirts that we had out there,  and the girls, whoever won the Yates Challenge had to hold the balls underwater for 15 seconds.  They won a T-shirt, but the other two girls that lost, 
[00:26:30]  if they showed a little something, they got a T-shirt, too.  So everybody was a winner.  Of course.  All right.  Everybody just absolutely loved it.  We got a lot of video and pictures of the pest booths, breasts, you name it, up on FBA,  if anybody wants to see that.  I don't know what you guys got on opianthony.com yet, but –  Yeah, we got – no, you guys are linked to opianthony.com.  Just look for FBA.  It's a great site.  It's got video and pictures of the event. 
[00:27:00]  Doug, we got to go just because we are ready to take a break here.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Bye, Pumpkin.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Come to Philly.  Yeah, the next stop is Philly, September 9th.  Technically, Jersey, though.  Tweeter Center in New Jersey, which is –  Yeah, well, Camden, the murder capital of the world.  Nice.  That's where we want to go.  I was reading a nice article on Camden over break.  Yeah?  Murder capital of the world.  The circus is coming to town.  We've been there, though, for OzFest and stuff.  It's no big deal.  You go over the bridge, and it's, believe it or not, the safe part of Camden. 
[00:27:30]  Everything's fine.  So we can't wait.  And I was talking to a lot of the O&A fans after the show.  They're planning on road tripping to Philly.  Now that they've seen the show, they're like, you know what?  We've got to go to Philly now and do the whole thing over again.  Follow it around.  In the parking lot and whatnot.  Because it's not just the show.  It's the whole thing.  They're planning karaoke parties the night before.  Yeah.  You know, they're nuts.  They are nuts.  It's going to be September 9th, Tweeter Center, the O&A Traveling Virus.  And the lineup is, I think, even better. 
[00:28:00]  I think we have, like, even more comedians for the Philly show.  I think you have it.  Yeah.  We actually have, instead of eight, we have ten.  We have ten comedians for the Philly show.  Yeah.  Myself, Ralphie Mae, Bob Kelly, Patrice O'Neal, Billy Burr, Jimmy Schubert, the great Dom Herrera,  who I can't wait to see.  Nice.  Oh, I suck.  Bob Saget.  Patrice O'Neal, you said.  Tracy Morgan, Ralphie Mae.  Tracy Morgan, yep.  And possibly Otto and George.  He killed.  Yeah.  He killed at the PNC. 
[00:28:30]  We want him for the Philly show now.  I want to bring him back.  So tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is up on OpieAndAnthony.com.  The ONA traveling virus coming to Philly in less than two weeks.  We can't wait.  All right?  Yep.  We're going to take our first break.  We'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I gots the cheddar.  I could pay to rank.  Four, three, two.  All right.  He's a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right. 
[00:29:00]  Hope you like crap.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Want to say hi to Sam Jackson from New York City on the instant feedback.  Are you going to talk about this S comedy show all day?  Yeah, all day.  One break.  Yes, douche, we are.  Yeah, we're going to talk about it a little more, actually.  Exactly.  So stop listening. 
[00:29:30]  Screw the one break.  It was the biggest Opie and Anthony event ever.  So far, we did one break, though.  And he's bitching.  We're very proud.  We're very proud of the show that was put on on Saturday at the PNC Arts Center.  And we're pumping Philly now because we're coming to town in less than two weeks.  We're broadcasting live from WISP.  We're going to take over Philly.  And then we're going to do that comedy show that Saturday night, September 9th.  We can't wait.  And the ONA pests are coming. 
[00:30:00]  The circus is coming to town.  Yes.  They're going to be doing the karaoke and the tailgating in the parking lot of the Tweeter Center.  And we're going to walk half our listeners through the tunnel.  Just like they do with the elephants when the real circle comes to town.  The real circle.  They better have room for us at the Tweeter Center.  Dolt.  I was trying not to cough in the circle.  Hey, hey, I made a mistake.  Oh, well.  Well, we're coming to Philly.  We've got to find out if they're going to open the parking lot nice and early for the ONA pests. 
[00:30:30]  You know how overwhelming it was to realize, like, I saw Sabbath there, man.  Like, I'm backstage at PNC.  And it's like, there's a guy, Mike, who I like a lot.  He actually runs, like, the security there.  And when I interviewed Geezer, Bill, and Tony for XM, that was where I went.  The Sabbath Village they have, it's called.  They have three little trailers for the guys.  Ozzy's on his bus.  Oh, no.  Are we ripping off Sabbath with the ONA Village?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  I didn't even realize that.  Oh, no.  Oh, we have to talk about that.  I'll say no because Village was there before Sabbath, even the word Village. 
[00:31:00]  But, no, that's what they call Sabbath Village.  It's like a little place for Tony, Geezer, and Bill so they're not in the little dressing rooms.  Yeah.  Just to relax and tune up.  And that's where I had to go.  It was right where we were hanging out in the back.  So, it was kind of overwhelming, man, to be in the same place that I was roveling before  Black Sabbath.  It was really, really great.  That is weird to stand up on the stage before everybody comes in, look at the seats.  Yeah.  Kind of like, oof.  I got this.  This is neat.  I'll bring in the pictures from my camera tomorrow.  There's a picture of me just looking out, you know, looking out at an empty venue, basically, 
[00:31:30]  on the stage.  Me and you.  It was pretty cool.  Pretty cool.  After the Patty thing, I went out on stage by myself to intro Anthony as Andrew Dice Gay,  and I hear from, like, the second row, up yours, buddy.  Like, people were so pissed about the Stalker Patty thing, and I heard it, and I could have  just moved on, because it's, like, over 12,000 people there.  Yeah.  I could have just smoothed things over.  I go, did you just say up yours, buddy? 
[00:32:00]  He goes, up yours!  I go, that means I'm doing my job.  There was, by the way, if anybody knows what it was.  On stage, I sensed there was something happening.  I could hear, like, something was going on, and I didn't know what it was.  And somebody said, like, there was, like, a brawl or something.  Yeah, we had one commotion in the back there on the lawn.  There was two arrests.  Two arrests?  Yeah, one out in the parking lot before the show.  Oh, no.  Some guys were, like, throwing a football around.  Well, one of those super footballs that go, like, 400 yards. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then they hit a bus, I guess, a busload of cops.  Wow.  Yeah.  The rest of the guy?  Oops.  I did some talking.  Yeah.  They were purposely hitting buses.  Oh.  And then they hit a bus that happened to have a cop or two on it.  Yeah.  And they stopped the bus, and the cop chased the guy down.  Right.  They brought him.  The state police have, like, a little, you know, substationary, and they gave him, like,  a desk appearance ticket.  And then, actually, during your set, there was a little commotion in the lawn. 
[00:33:00]  Okay, I heard something, and I'm like, oh, my God, is the crowd not liking it?  I'm like, no.  And I'm looking out, and the people are having fun.  I'm like, there's something happening, and I didn't know what it was.  Yeah, I don't know what precipitated the whole thing, but somebody got locked up during your  set on the lawn.  All right.  Okay, that's great.  That's like a rock show.  That's what you want during a rock show.  Fight in the mud.  Good.  Let's say hi to Seth in Brooklyn.  Seth.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I just want to say thank you so much.  The show is amazing.  Eddie O'Neill, ONA show fans, should definitely come out. 
[00:33:30]  There's so much ONA love.  It was really great out there.  Jimmy, you were absolutely phenomenal.  Thank you, man.  Never saw you in person.  Bob Kelly killed everybody.  Completely.  Dice Gay was absolutely amazing.  But I wanted to add, at intermission, is it New Jersey state law that the girls can't  be naked because they're fully clothed?  Yeah, you can't miss a mixed nudity and alcohol.  Right.  Because we would have thought there definitely would have been like midgets with dildos up  there otherwise.  Oh, you're talking about the strippers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We couldn't have them nude on stage.  But they were wearing tiny little outfits. 
[00:34:00]  You got the point.  Scantily clad.  You can't have nudity and alcohol, though, unless you want to throw money to the state.  The girls were courtesy of Headquarters Gentleman's Cabaret, 38th.  And 11th.  I got to be honest.  I was very impressed with the girls.  Backstage, they were really smoking.  And that's where you had your big appearance, too.  So it's lucky they recovered from that massive bombing here.  Wow.  Yeah, it really was awful.  You should walk into that club with Hezbollah written on your chest.  Yeah, we thought Club Soda Kenny had a little juice, so we gave him a little promotional appearance 
[00:34:30]  at this fine gentleman's club headquarters.  And no one showed up.  Yeah, not one person.  Not one person.  All right.  Thank you, Seth.  Let's go on to Gabe.  Gabe, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  I wanted to thank you guys for having my jug band perform in the village on Saturday.  Yeah, the Wahoo Skiffle Crazies Band, I believe, right?  Yes, you got the name right.  That's awesome.  Thank you.  It's written right in front of me here.  Thank you.  You should get correct.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You guys were great.  People weren't sure what to make of you guys, but they were very entertained. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, we had a great time, and we'll be seeing you boys in Camden.  We're playing that show with you, too.  Right on.  So thanks again, man.  You're welcome, Steve.  All right, Gabe.  Psycho, Jersey, what's up?  How are you doing?  What?  All right, he was just going to say how great the show was.  Dan in Patterson.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  I'm the blind kid that met you on Saturday night.  Oh, yeah.  What's up, man?  I just want to say thank you so much for everything, man.  You're blind, dude?  Yeah.  Ew. 
[00:35:30]  Jimmy, I hate you.  Do you like the T-shirt Opie gave you?  Yeah, it was great.  Thanks, Kenny, and thanks, Opie.  I wanted to meet Anthony, but I didn't see him there, neither.  I didn't see anybody.  I didn't see anybody at all.  Anthony was right next to me when I met you.  Yeah.  He just didn't say anything.  I was there.  And, yeah, I wanted to say hi to Keith, the cop, too.  Well, you didn't want to say hi to me just because you knew I wouldn't touch you because  of your whole eye thing?  Poor fellow. 
[00:36:00]  Who walked you over?  Your mom?  Yeah, that was my mom.  Yeah, she was very, very cool.  We were off to the side, and all of a sudden, Dan comes up with his mom to meet me, and  we talked for a little while.  And then you walked away and back to your killer seats, and I'm thinking to myself, the kid's  blind.  Why not save a few bucks and go up on the lawn?  Oh.  I swear to God, that's what I was thinking.  I was pretty happy with our seats, actually.  It was great.  We had a great time.  And I met Mencia. 
[00:36:30]  He was really nice, too.  So everything was a lot of fun.  You guys were great.  Yeah, he's a blind kid, but he's wearing his Opie and Anthony t-shirts.  And, yeah, I saw you during the show.  You looked like you were having a great time there, Dan.  Oh, man.  Yeah, and guys, do you remember Krista the blind chick?  Yes.  I don't know.  I know her, by the way.  Oh, you know Krista?  Of course you do.  I don't know her in person.  I know her online, though.  Oh, excuse me.  You know her from online?  Yes.  How did that happen?  First of all, was there like a blind people underground chat room? 
[00:37:00]  There's a website, zonebbs.com.  I don't know if I'm allowed to promote that.  Too late.  I already did.  Zonebbs?  Why not?  And what is it?  Blindsight?  Yeah, well, a lot of blind people go on there, and you can send quick notes and stuff like  that, and I met her through there.  That'd be quick.  Yeah, how quick is it?  You're handing the wrong part of the key.  X, B, L, F, and a half a parenthesis.  I know what that means.  Is it, do you use, by the way, on Saturday night, you killed, man. 
[00:37:30]  Thanks, Mike.  Do you use voice thing on that site?  What's up?  Do you use voice to text on that site?  Uh, they have a voice, uh, chat system, but, um, you, you just send, uh, text.  Have you been blind your whole life, Dan?  No, uh, I got blind at five.  Oh, so you know you're blind.  Oh, at five?  Yeah, um, I was born with cataracts, and, uh, and, uh, they did a-  Can they fix that?  Yeah.  Knew that was coming.  And knew Kenny would get a kick out of it. 
[00:38:00]  Of course he would.  The old cataract joke.  Any type of, any type of joke that a seven-year-old would enjoy.  Yeah.  And he jumps up and down like Fred Gwynn for.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Cataract, Grandpa!  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Lily!  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Big oaf.  Wait a minute, you had cataracts.  Yep.  And then, can they fix that?  Well, they were trying to, and I think that's what made me blind. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, no.  Someone screw up.  I'm starting to think we could get you some eyes.  Yeah.  Isn't it just your corneas?  I had a whole bunch of eye surgeries, and it was crazy.  How old are you, man?  I'm 13.  Now, do you remember what your parents looked like and stuff like that?  At five?  Well, you know, not really, but I do remember, like, if you said a color to me, I know what it looks like.  Wow.  Is that better or worse? 
[00:39:00]  I don't know.  Like, Stevie Wonder never saw anything.  You know, at least it's better, you know, than, at least it's better than nothing.  Like, Krista the blind chick, she was born fully blind, y'all.  You ever see stuff?  When you dream, you ever see stuff?  Ooh.  Wow, that, yeah, I heard the Krista bit, too, and you asked her this question, too.  Question.  I don't, I can't really tell, actually.  Yeah, I guess that's a no.  What did she say?  That's a great question.  What do you dream of when you've been born blind?  Yeah.  Just blackness. 
[00:39:30]  I don't know, man.  Just voices, I guess, right?  Yeah, voices.  Yeah, you gotta still dream.  Talking.  You have no depth perception.  It's like radio.  You just hear things.  Oof.  Creepy.  Wow.  I gotta say, that's creepy.  But this kid is really cool.  I met him, and it's almost like you don't even give a crap you're blind, Dan.  No, dude.  I, you know, I don't get mad at anything.  I can take jokes.  I'm not like, hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo, I'm blind.  Hoo-hoo.  I've created blindness, Robin.  Hoo-hoo. 
[00:40:00]  No one was blind before me.  Yeah, all right.  Whatever.  Where do you live in, north or south Jersey?  North.  Hey, Dan, hold on a line.  We're gonna send you some more stuff, all right?  Thanks, man.  And if you want to come to Camden, just leave your address and contact, phone number, and  I'll hook it up.  No problem.  Thank you so much, Kenny.  Okay.  And we'll get your mother's credit card number to charge for those tickets.  I love you guys.  See you, buddy.  Later on.  Hold on a line.  There's Dan from Patterson.  He was very, very cool. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Yeah, it sounds like something's screwed up, though, because cataracts, they can fix that.  I'm starting to think we could get that kid to rise.  Maybe I shouldn't say that and give him this hope.  Imagine if we got somebody vision.  Oh, how great would it be?  Especially if we just took it back.  Anytime we want.  And took it back at a comedy show.  At a live show, yeah.  That's what we would do.  At a live show.  Go on stage and threw acid in his face.  Read off the chart.  He does it.  He cheers.  And then you scrawled his eyes to go, teehee.  12,000 people. 
[00:41:00]  Here's your cane.  12,000 people with teary eyes, just applauding.  And just ended with acid in his eyes.  He's a little visine for you, pal.  You darts.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  I was down there to the PNC on Saturday night.  Yeah.  And I've seen his comedy show.  I don't know if you guys want to get off the subject.  Like that guy said, is this all you're going to talk about?  Well, no, we're going to get off the subject, but it was a great night for us.  No, I don't want to talk about anything else.  This thing was the best fun I had in about 10 years. 
[00:41:30]  Excellent.  I can't believe how good Bill Burr was.  Yeah, everyone had their favorites.  Bill's great, man.  Bill is fantastic.  I was talking to my wife after the show.  She's the original church lady, and she doesn't go for this kind of humor.  And she was laughing her rear end off through the whole show.  Even when Otto and George were out there, she was laughing about that whole thing about  calling the people up on the lawn, the Katrina victim.  Oh, that was really funny.  Why didn't you hear that?  That's hilarious.  And he threw out some JonBenet joke that was just awful and tasteless. 
[00:42:00]  It could be the worst thing anybody's ever said on a stage.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Listen, I'm trucking right now, so I've got to get back to what I'm doing here.  So I just wanted to say thanks, and I'm going to be down in Camden to see you, though.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying they're going to make the road trip now after what they saw  at the PNC.  Thank you, Brian.  All right, buddy.  And, you know, for the rest of the people that didn't go to the show, you know,  you can check out the pictures, you can check out the videos, go to opieandanthony.com.  Check out the links to all the fan sites because they have their own thing going on,  their own videos and pictures. 
[00:42:30]  You can go to YouTube and get bootleg video from the show, which makes us very, very happy  because we would love to play clips of this thing to prove to you how great it was, but  we can't do that.  So you go to YouTube, throw Opie and Anthony in the search, and you'll see a bunch of videos  from the show Saturday.  When are we in Cleveland?  September 23rd.  Okay, at the, what's it, Tower City Amphitheater?  Is that correct?  Yes, yes.  Okay, cool.  We only have two shows left.  The first one, September 9th, Tweeter Center.  In less than two weeks for all you Philly people, we're going to take over Philly. 
[00:43:00]  We're going to broadcast from WYSP.  We're going to do it upright.  The O&A Circus coming to town.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We've got to say hi to Vegas after the break.  Yes.  Bobby Kelly is stopping by to say hi.  We've got Emmy Talk and other things to get to.  Bobby's coming here?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  He should be here in a few minutes.  He might even be here already.  Oh, dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Don't you want to.  Dude.  You know, dude, you ever stop rehearsing and then talking to me, stupid. 
[00:43:30]  We're going to break with Jared.  Jared in Boston, go.  Hey, boy.  Take the eyes.  Take the eyes.  Yeah.  See OB yelling that on stage.  Take his eyes.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  It's like punch sound, women scream, Opie and Anthony.  That's right. 
[00:44:00]  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, Vegas?  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  We say hi to Vegas this morning.  We were in Vegas before.  For a short time.  On a crappy AM.  Yeah, I know.  But we were there.  We're rocking the FM now.  That's right.  Nice.  So there are people there that remember us. 
[00:44:30]  People there that have no clue what the hell this show is all about.  People like this show in Vegas, I remember.  I'm very happy we're back on there.  Yeah, we were doing quite well with the AM signal, but now we're on a big FM.  Nice to be back.  So what's up, Vegas?  Some people don't get it.  Don't worry.  It's a virus.  You listen for a little while.  It infects you, and you find yourself listening every day.  And next thing you know, you're making travel plans to go to the O&A virus. 
[00:45:00]  Traveling virus.  I was talking to people from all over the country that flew in for that PNC show, by the way.  Yep.  Very, very cool.  It's our first day back from vacation.  Different factions were all lined up.  The message board people, the MySpace people, PalTalk people, all in their little cliques, their little groups.  I saw backstage, the guys I saw, I saw, of course, No Phil DeFall was there with his wife, at least.  Of course.  I saw Doug at Doug, and his chick was way too hot for him. 
[00:45:30]  I saw Sonny Frehley.  I didn't see any, like, Wackbag or Net people.  I just saw those guys.  I mean, the faction's still fighting, or are people getting along better now?  No, I think they're getting along better.  There's still a little infighting that goes on.  Oh, why doesn't everybody just cut the malarkey?  I mean, hold on, better than that.  There was infighting.  There was, like, a huge PalTalk tragedy that happened over the course of vacation.  It was just, like, unbelievable.  Yeah, what was that about?  This is just part of what, like, when you do a show like this, and your audience is so interactive, and we have, I don't know if you want to call it a relationship, but it's closer than any other radio show has with their audience. 
[00:46:00]  We get on these things like PalTalk video conferencing, MySpace, things like that, where, you know, I'll pop on PalTalk and have a camera in front of my face at my house, just drinking, having fun, you know, watching other people do things.  Then you find out that a couple of people died, or one person, at least. 
[00:46:30]  That's the last I heard.  Oh, no, too.  They both wound up dying.  That's what I heard, yeah.  And there is a relationship, by the way, because in those PalTalk rooms, you go in there a lot.  I mean, we're sometimes, you know, talking to people.  I mean, we know these people, like the fans of the show.  We're not, I mean, any fans of the show know that this is, we're very approachable people.  Yeah.  But, you know, wait a couple years, and then we'll just spit on you.  The more markets, the less you talk to us. 
[00:47:00]  That's right.  Apparently, a couple had met on PalTalk, and we were together for, I don't know, a couple of months, and things kind of went awry.  And the guy flipped out when they were breaking up.  Because the PalTalkers were getting together for a softball game.  It was Boston versus New York.  Like we said earlier, this whole Opie and Anthony thing is becoming like a lifestyle.  Like after the show, we end the radio show, but the experience doesn't end.  Yeah, they keep doing things.  They all hook up.  Then they had a softball game going on. 
[00:47:30]  They plan events all the time.  Yeah.  Had a softball game going on between Boston and New York.  Halfway between, right?  Like an upstate New York, Westchester, or something like that?  Yeah.  And there was a party, and the girl was there, and the guy was there, and they were having problems.  And the guy asked the girl to step outside, and when she did, he shot her, and then shot himself.  And they both died.  Yeah.  Wow.  Apparently, he had – someone had said – like I didn't know them, except by a quick hi in the room. 
[00:48:00]  Her, I remembered her name, though, because like obviously when you sign on a PalTalk, you click on all the new names you don't recognize.  You just have to look for girls, even if you're not going to talk to them to look at them.  So I remembered her.  I had seen her.  Just to look.  She's a beautiful girl.  And his name I recognized.  And he had brought, I guess, a gun up from wherever he was from in Jersey.  So there was like something going on with that guy where he was planning on doing something.  Yeah.  And they weren't even going to get it that long.  I mean it's never excusable, but it's like if someone's together for 10 years, all right, well, whatever.  But you understand where there's like something built up.  But after a few months – 
[00:48:30]  It's just odd, though, when something like that happens and you know it was like – it was in one of these rooms that – it was a room that was there for the show.  And that's kind of how they hooked up.  So it's like you sit there and go, ooh, that's kind of creepy.  Not that you knew the people.  But friends are at that house.  I think one or two of the people I didn't know and two are actually a good friend of mine.  And I'm glad they're cool.  I mean I'm glad they're –  Yeah, yeah.  It's sad that that happened, though.  I mean it's just some scumbag.  Guys are just such scumb – let it go! 
[00:49:00]  God almighty, what's wrong with men?  They heard gunshots from –  Oh, yeah, that's what woke her up.  My friend said she had dozed off for like 20 seconds and was awakened to the sound of gun pop.  And, you know, I guess that awful sound of a gun and ran outside and saw her friend, the girl laying dead.  And the guy laying there – and he apparently tried to say something.  I guess he had just like, you know, survived it briefly or whatever.  And so she said that they just ran in the house and locked the door. 
[00:49:30]  It's like it's such a weird panic move you make.  Like you're not thinking rationally.  It's just like a violence.  Hide from it.  Yeah, run, run, run.  Yeah, and then they called and he died.  I think the next day he died.  They kept him on life support just so his parents could come.  But it's just weird because it's, you know, related to the show in some way.  So you kind of feel like, wow, that's really kind of twisted, you know?  Yeah.  Creepy.  Even though you don't know them well, you know them.  Yeah, yeah, that it's some type of tie-in to your life and what you do. 
[00:50:00]  You know they listen to you on a daily basis.  You know, they listen to what we were saying on the air and things like that.  So it's like, ugh, kind of creepy.  But just to know that some guy is that obsessed with a girl, I just don't get it, man.  I want to put it in profound perspective.  There are plenty of other fish in the sea.  There you go.  Can I just, you know, put it out there in a profound way like that?  I made that up myself.  Well, it's good.  I mean, I don't understand the relevance of a relationship and other fish in the sea. 
[00:50:30]  Colin Quinn screamed at me one time because he was talking about his breakup.  And I said, dude, you know, I mean, I know it's hard, but I mean, there's plenty of people  you could meet.  And he goes, did you just tell me there's plenty of fish in the sea, mom?  And he hung up on me.  Oh, he smashed me.  He should have, too.  But that is the way it is.  I mean, it's like when you're getting dumped or whatever, just stop it, you faggots.  Just get on with it.  I hate possessive men, you weak pussies.  Just get on with your life.  Yeah, some people can't. 
[00:51:00]  They go, if I can't have you, yeah, if I can't have you, no one's going to have you.  I think they're like, they're alpha males and they're possessive animals.  Just, you're not a big alpha male.  You're a faggot who can't move on with your life.  I've been dumped.  It stinks.  You cry in your own stupid pillow and you shut your mouth.  Oh, you're crying a little.  Oh, I have.  You bet I have.  I was devastated.  One girl broke up with me.  It hurts.  It hurts so bad.  This is where I live at Florentine.  I was crawling up my steps, crying.  I couldn't.  Oh my God.  Crawling up your steps, crying. 
[00:51:30]  I was devastated.  With snot coming out of your nose and drool and tears and earwax.  Dude, it was suicidal.  And this was, I was, this is like maybe, you know, what, a few years ago.  I was living with Jim Florentine in Jersey, man.  And I didn't know what a pit I had fallen into.  My friend Elizabeth in South Jersey goes, there's something really wrong with you.  This is like a month later.  She goes, you're in a pit.  There's something very bad about you.  I was in a manic depression where all I kept thinking about is, I know I'm going to blow  my head off, but it's a matter of when. 
[00:52:00]  It was, it became very terrible.  Just going to, you know, figure out when.  Yeah.  But I mean, it was like, I never occurred to me to hurt the girl.  Not once did I think I'm going to go over there and hurt her.  I mean, and I was as devastated by this as I've ever been by a chick leaving me justifiably  because I was an awful boyfriend.  But just any man that just does it, I just, you're just, you weak faggot.  I just, I want to just, I can't stomach men who are possessed like that.  It's odd you bring that up because it's, I think usually with guys and stuff, it is just  you kind of internalize it and it's about you and how awful it is. 
[00:52:30]  You know, not that I was ever at a point where I was going to do any real bodily harm to myself.  I told you that one time that I had a girl break up with me and I decided to take a baseball  bat and try to break my arm.  Yeah.  To get sympathy.  Right.  Say, look, I'm in a cast.  Do you love me again?  Right.  Like how stupid does that even seem?  What a queer.  It is just such a dopey thing.  Hey, you couldn't even walk.  You couldn't even walk.  Crawling and.  Crawling and crying up your footsteps is worse than breaking your arm. 
[00:53:00]  I'm the referee today.  What bothers me is just the method he was going to use.  They're both faggotty, but Jesus, Jimmy.  There's no way he would have.  You lost muscle control.  All right.  I'm not saying I didn't.  I handled it well.  I was in a pit for months.  Yeah.  Just the idea that he was going to hit his own arm and go, huh?  See?  That's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's bad too.  They're both.  I'm Italian.  I had to use a bat.  You know.  Wait.  So what was the thought process?  You're like, if I, if I show that I've been weakened, that she'll feel sorry for me?  The thought process was for some reason, if I had a broken arm and my arm is in a cast, 
[00:53:30]  it would garner sympathy from this girl.  And all I needed was a little something.  I couldn't have fallen so far out of grace with her that, that I would need more than  that.  All I needed was a little bit of sympathy and she'd come running back to me.  And now like, I couldn't even do it right.  Like I just ended up with a big bruise on my arm.  Like at the, like I gave it a good swing, but then at the last minute you hold back and  hold bunt.  Of course you do.  I like bunted my arm.  That's why this guy probably lived by the way, because when you're hurting yourself like 
[00:54:00]  that, you're shooting yourself.  They said instinctively, I don't know how he did it, but you, you, there's a part where  you will jerk back.  Yeah.  Unless you really want to do it.  Like our wire or something.  Well, you put it in the mouth, put it in your mouth.  It doesn't matter if you move.  Yeah, that ain't moving too far.  Did I know you, Jimmy, when you cried up the stairs?  Oh yeah, I think you did.  I mean, uh, yeah.  You really?  Oh, dude, I was.  Oh, that is devastating.  The whole image of just crawling because your leg muscles have given away with, with, with  sorrow. 
[00:54:30]  I couldn't.  I was.  Jimmy, why are you crying?  We got some audio of Jimmy here, I think.  Don't you do it.  Don't.  You.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  That's a girl.  You see that shirt?  I got nothing else. 
[00:55:00]  He had reason, though, to be sad.  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  And it was even more depressing if you saw the Cliffside Park dump I was crawling up to.  It's not like I was crawling up to my comfortable New York apartment.  It was that cesspool I lived in with mold.  Is it true that your godfather may have been there when you finally did open the door?  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you? 
[00:55:30]  Yes, of course he was at two in the morning after I did a set at the cellar, as he normally  is.  Just waiting at the top of the steps for his little jimmikins to come up happily as normal.  I just didn't want to wake my roommates.  Oh, you poor bastard.  I wouldn't either.  So that's why you cried into the pillow?  Dude, I was like, there was no sound coming out.  And I crawled.  Oh, no.  Uncut she-mail behind him.  That's why he's spiraling into the pillow.  Daddy, shut up and stop crying.  Stop it. 
[00:56:00]  A silent cry.  I'm here for you, Dad.  Was there a song involved or anything?  No.  I don't think I had a song with her, did I?  No.  No, did you play a song when you came home just to make it hurt that much more?  Make it hurt more.  Everybody hurts.  Sometimes everybody cries.  He plays it again just so he gets home perfectly right when it ends so he can shut it off, open  the door, fall to his knees with tears. 
[00:56:30]  And then I look up the comedy tragedy symbols on the internet and I go, yeah, that's the  way it is, man.  I've got to now get a tattoo.  Oh, I need a teardrop somewhere on my body now.  Yeah, I have to capture this moment.  It's so important to me right now.  So you really crawled up the stairs?  I was.  Oh, God.  I was nervous.  That's why I'm not a guy who could never own a gun.  That's why I never allow myself to get a gun.  Yeah.  Because I don't trust myself.  I never trust myself.  You just would use it too often.  That moment without a doubt.  I would have never shot her.  It never occurred to me to go in and screw her. 
[00:57:00]  Never.  That's what I mean.  It's always been like an internal kind of a, you know, you feel so sorry for yourself  and why me?  Why me?  I wrote a poem once.  Pussy.  Ew.  I wrote a poem.  Especially with your awful grammar.  Oh.  Bob Kelly in studio.  You wrote a poem.  Yeah.  My first girlfriend cheated on me with some hockey player.  Oof.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I got a number and I was, who's it?  My cousin.  My cousin, Sean. 
[00:57:30]  What was the poem called?  Puck you.  How do you compete with a hockey player?  You don't, apparently.  You don't.  Yeah, you don't.  You go and tell some jokes.  What are you, stand in a goalie uniform between her kneecaps?  I'm trying to.  This was before jokes, though.  I mean.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I didn't have gray hair crying on a snoop.  I'm 38. 
[00:58:00]  I wasn't 38.  I was younger.  But I was 30.  I was close to 30.  Oh, is that sad?  What was the poem about?  I don't know what I'd do if I saw a grown man crying upstairs.  I don't know if I'd kick him or help him up.  I was about, she, you know what, I'll tell you.  I wish, if I find it, I'll give it to you.  Yeah.  I just think I have it laminated because it was really good.  Was it really good or was it really bad? 
[00:58:30]  Well, it was really bad.  The Take Me Back poem, never good.  I wrote one, yeah, I wrote one, too.  To the same, it was the same girl I tried to break my arm.  I mean, I really gave it my all and just, you'd realize how futile the whole thing is  and you're trying to write a stupid poem and you have no poetry skills whatsoever.  I got one line right here, right?  If I ever find that love I heard in a song.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew. 
[00:59:00]  And here's the rhyme part.  Now, if I threw my coffee in your face, it wouldn't be wrong.  Not only are you melodramatic, but that's awful.  It was about, ew.  I hate this show.  It's like therapy.  What rhymes with it, Bobby?  You just start revealing crap and you walk out and you feel better, but you feel raped at the same time.  You're like, why did I stay on the show you say this?  Yeah, you feel better about being raped and molested.  You wanted to find a song that you, what song did you want to think of love? 
[00:59:30]  It's Raining Men, you faggot.  What song?  What was the rhyme to that?  I remember it was something like, will I ever find that love I heard in a song?  Yeah, but you heard this in a song.  What was the song?  No, it was, it was just.  It could just be a generic song.  Nah, nah, nah, not buying it.  There was probably a song that really got to you.  Inspired you.  Oh my God, now that is the love I'm looking for.  What was the song?  I'm going to use that line in my next poem.  Yeah, what was the song? 
[01:00:00]  That's the love I'm looking for.  I forget the song.  I swear to God, I can't believe I remember that one line.  I remember that line because I remember when I wrote it, I was like, this is a good line.  All right, I know the song.  That's a good line.  No, not that one because that's Jimmy's song.  You got to find Journey, Open Arms.  Is that the love?  I probably sang that.  Is that the love?  That's a good song when you say it because you can actually, you think you can sing it.  You know what I mean?  That's the song that you can actually, I'm not going to sing it.  I almost just sang it.  Wow, that would have been good.  Yeah, you're all friends.  Why don't you sing it?  Just give us some verse. 
[01:00:30]  We're among friends.  Look at Elby's face.  Oh, look at that face.  Let's hear it.  We're all buddies.  What's the problem?  I was going to judge you.  You don't get judged for a buddy.  Well, I mean, this is just a good song.  If I could only find the love of what?  What was the line again?  I was in the back of a library, Malden High School, by myself, raining.  Looking up lyrics.  First and last time in that type of building.  First and last time in that type of building.  We used to lie beside each other.  We're beating your heart beat with mine. 
[01:01:00]  Mine was real.  Yeah.  A bit heavy because it just had a tuna melt.  The new guy crosses the blue line.  He's in the crease.  This guy knows how to score.  He's leading the league in goals.  She joined a fraternity.  That's when I knew it was over.  She had me make the t-shirt stew for all our fraternity sisters.  Here it comes. 
[01:01:30]  Here it comes.  Get ready.  Don't tear up.  Wait a second.  Oh, Bobby.  Oh, now I've found you.  Yeah.  Love it all.  We can't forget it.  You use your tongue, Bertier, in a $20 hole.  That's the hockey player.  Of course.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. 
[01:02:00]  It's in the hole.  And congratulations to Bob for dating the only chick that ever joined a fraternity.  Yeah, sorority, sorority, sorority, sorority.  Yeah, no kidding.  Maybe that was the problem.  My girlfriend, Dirk.  Sorority.  Yeah, sure.  It was a sorority.  Yeah, yeah.  We're buying it for that.  It was really the hockey player, and he met some chick.  That's what the story was.  She went with Cam Neely.  Why do you know Cam Neely, you crying stupid? 
[01:02:30]  I know two hockey names.  His and Gretzky.  I was a bitch.  I'm not going to say that.  I'm crying stupid.  I need to bring that up.  It hurt.  No.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That is terrible.  Were you reading the newspaper, the sports page in the back when you were crying on the  stoop?  What?  Crawling.  That's rough, man.  Crawling.  When your legs give out because of sorrow, wow.  You ever see Jimmy's leg muscles, though? 
[01:03:00]  He probably just...  Hey, he's got some fine calves.  Now he does.  I have great gams.  Oh, look.  How are you doing?  Bowling pins.  There's nothing more annoying on Lucky Lewing than seeing those fat aunt calves.  But they're muscular.  They're all muscle, Bob.  Bobby, get me the potato salad, you little fat, sweaty calf.  Did you scrape up your knees on the stoop while you were...  No, no, it wasn't the stoop.  It was my steps.  It was up to the second floor.  This was like, you know, 12 steps.  How appropriate.  How ironic.  How appropriate. 
[01:03:30]  12 steps.  I don't know.  If I worked them, maybe I wouldn't have been crying.  You remember the first name?  What?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to say it.  Oh, I know.  No, I can't.  Were you saying it, though, as you went up the stairs?  I don't even think it was anything with that much clarity.  Oh, Mildred.  Were you saying why a lot in between crying?  Oh, why?  I know.  He was screaming at God.  You bitch.  You were blaming God.  I know you were blaming God.  No, it was really late, so there was nothing loud. 
[01:04:00]  God, you hate me.  Why?  Now play the other song.  Yeah.  That's Jimmy's crying.  Awful.  Everybody hurts.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  I love you, Jenny James.  This song was written for me.  I love you, Jenny James.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  I was a sensitive gentleman. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's sad.  So you're crawling up the stairs, and were you saying, like, were you cursing God, or  were you saying, you bitch, or?  No, I wasn't, uh, it was more like, all right, I gotta do something drastic here.  Were you picturing her with other guys?  I, yeah.  Oh, jeez, that's the, that's the worst thing.  It wasn't cement, it was regular steps. 
[01:05:00]  Did you punch it with the bottom of your palm so you didn't hurt your knuckles?  No, I didn't.  Because she already, she already had some other guy?  I think she was starting to hook up with some other guy.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  And we were gonna have, like, a nice night together.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And it came out because we were listening to a song, and it was a really weird thing.  I picked her up, we were listening to this song.  What song?  It was a song.  What song? 
[01:05:30]  Karma Chameleon?  No, nothing.  That happened.  No, no, it's not like a mushy song.  It was a song that involved Secret Lovers.  Was it that song?  No.  That was, Friends and Lovers was my first song with a girl, though.  Really?  Myself and Michelle, when I was, yeah, I was 15.  That was our song.  We were friends first.  Then became lovers.  Cute.  Yeah.  Should have been called Friends and Erection Difficulties.  So there's a song, but you can't remember it. 
[01:06:00]  I do, but I don't want to give away who she was.  But it wasn't a mushy song at all.  The point I'm making is, the song sparked a conversation between us.  Uh-oh.  It was an artist we both like.  It was so casual.  Sounds like she was just waiting for any excuse to start this conversation.  Yeah.  Like the car not so...  It would have been, hey, guess what?  But if it was not...  Like our relationship, this isn't going anywhere.  But it wasn't a mushy song at all.  What band?  Black Sabbath?  No, no.  I had his name, Dan Byrne, who I actually like a lot. 
[01:06:30]  But it was such a lot of mushy song.  Oh my God, that's like a one-hit wonder type of name.  Dan Byrne.  No, he's actually a guy.  He's like an underground type of dude.  I think he sounds like Bob Dylan a little bit, but he's really a great, great...  How does this song bring up the fact that she's dating a dude with abs?  No, we started...  Oh my God, Dan does a song called He's Not Fat Like You.  That is horrible. 
[01:07:00]  You poor bastard, man.  All right, we should take a break.  Bob Kelly is here.  We'll continue down this road because this is too good.  Hey, you have fun on Saturday night there, Bob?  12,000 people was ridiculous.  That was over 12, even.  It was ridiculous.  Yeah, what a blast, man.  It was close to 13, but Kenny goes, don't say 13,000.  That's an unlucky number.  See?  So we're saying over 12,000.  Say just under 14 now.  Yeah.  Well, then we're doing a little of that exaggeration.  20,000.  Right. 
[01:07:30]  That's right.  This is the six million man comedy show.  How amazing was the show, though?  Four hours people were laughing.  The crowd...  You know it's a good crowd when you tell a joke and then they're just waiting for the  next one.  Mm-hmm.  Well, 13...  Was it 40,000 people?  40,000.  Yeah.  Which is...  Ah, they were the best crowd ever.  All the way up to...  The lawn seats.  Yeah.  I thought, yeah, all the way up to Carl's, but I was thinking all the way up to the  lawn seats, too.  That was probably the best crowd I've ever performed in front of.  E-Rock walked around the lawn and got some great pictures.  Those are up on opiantathlete.com as well. 
[01:08:00]  And there's pictures of people on the lawn, like, with ponchos on, because it kind of  had that kind of misty rain, and they're just sitting there laughing their asses  off.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  We were walking out.  I was...  I took...  You guys took the little golf carts up to the meeting.  Yeah.  I jumped in the cop car.  Oh.  Drove up.  A big fan of the show.  On a state trooper that was outside.  Hey, trooper.  He was a big kid.  Oh, he got mad at me, though.  He almost...  He really pissed at me.  He was like, dude, a big fan.  He got in.  I took the...  I go, can I get on the walkie-talkie, the loudspeaker?  Yeah.  So I start going, hey, Robert Kelly, MySpace slash Robert Kelly Live, robertkelleylive.com. 
[01:08:30]  And I wouldn't shut my face.  Literally for 10 minutes, and he grabbed it out of my hand.  He goes, hey, thanks.  Yeah.  He put it back down.  He should have.  He goes, here.  This is where you get out.  Yeah.  He's just awkward.  He's like, here, here.  Get out.  Well, Bob just feels so, like, comfortable in those vehicles from your youth.  I was in the front.  Not in the front.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  This is what the front seat looked like.  It was roomy.  Well, I'm heading to Dallas this weekend for the improv, and it's not that you're going  to be a letdown, but... 
[01:09:00]  Addison.  12,000 people, yes.  Addison, yes.  You're going to be in Addison this weekend?  Yeah.  I know.  Oh, that's weird.  I'm going to be in Houston at the live stop this weekend.  I was...  Oh, okay.  I was at Houston last week.  We should meet in the middle.  Let's meet somewhere and talk.  We'll meet in the middle.  Cry in a stoop.  There you go.  Cry.  Yeah.  It's going to be a big letdown after 12,000 people.  A bunch of you hillbillies in a stupid room.  Well, we want to do Howie math now.  The official number is 50,000 people.  Now it's 50,000.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[01:09:30]  We've got to do some Howie math.  Over 50,000 people saw the ONA traveling virus at the PNC Arts Center.  September 9th, Tweeter Center.  Philly, we're coming your way.  We're taking over that whole city.  60,000 seat arena, right?  Yeah.  Something like that.  And Bob Kelly will be at that show as well.  We're going to be tailgating and doing everything down there.  We're going to take over the radio station.  We're going to take over the city.  We can't wait.  We're broadcasting that Friday, right?  The day before.  Oh, yeah.  And I want to do a shift on my own, do a little music shift on WISP, maybe bring Jimmy and  some of the other boys in. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  I want to just take over the radio station for the weekend.  Look at you wanting to work more.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Absolutely.  All right.  So the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll continue with Bob Kelly.  We got your Gene Levanchi thing.  Oh, you got it?  That we talked about just before vacation.  What thing?  He slapped Gene Levanchi in the face.  Gene Levanchi slapped him.  I saw that video.  It was hysterical.  He was doing a thing in Boston there and he got on TV and a whole thing happened.  Yeah.  And we told you to do a John Carr reference. 
[01:10:30]  So you were mentioning that John Carr was opening for you.  I kept going.  I couldn't stop once I started.  And they had no clue.  And it's a news show.  It's a news show.  And he went to their website.  It was the top story.  Yeah.  It said John Carr seven times on their website.  Yeah.  And then me going, John Carr is opening for me at the Comedy Connector.  The guy, by the way.  He didn't even make the...  Bob, you rock because we asked you to do it.  You did it.  And we got the audio.  John Carr, for anyone out there who doesn't recognize the name, is the guy who is now  he confessed to the Ramsey killing as well as being Sasquatch and the Yates drowning. 
[01:11:00]  It's a psycho.  I think he didn't have enough frequent flyer miles to get back from Thailand.  Stupid.  He's a psychopath.  I did it.  It was an accident.  We were on our way to the movies and she tripped.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Shut up.  All right.  Ralphie Mae is also here.  He's going to join the program in a little bit.

[01:12:30]  Bob Kelly in studio.  And just before vacation, I got to tell my baby turtle story from vacation.  And Ant's a guy to tell his Hollywood stories.  Hollywood.  Got just too much going on today.  Your baby turtle story?  Huh?  Tell me it involved work boots and concrete and a crying five-year-old.  No, you'd be proud.  You'd be proud of me, actually, Jimmy.  I went on vacation to the Outer Banks in North Carolina.  11-hour drive. 
[01:13:00]  You four-wheeled down a beach.  I thought he was crab fishing when he said the Outer Banks.  Like, I thought that was where they take those boats out in the...  The world's deadliest catch.  Deadliest catch.  That's what I was doing over vacation.  Yes, you were, like, baiting crab pots or something in the cold.  He was actually baiting quahogs on the beach shore.  I don't know what he was doing.  World's deadliest catch.  You throw the rod in and you pull up Robert Reed.  Wrapped in barbed wire. 
[01:13:30]  He's waving at you with his little poof of 1969 hair, the really cool one he had.  A little afro.  Yeah, I liked it a lot.  I had a great time.  I went on vacation with the Schmigos.  And you four-wheeled down a beach.  You stay in a beach house for a week.  It's a hassle to get to town, so you just kind of hang out on the beach for a week.  It's very relaxing.  No phones.  No Blackberries.  Isn't that what they evacuate whenever there's a hurricane?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, I take the chance every year. 
[01:14:00]  Because when I said before that that's where I was going, people were like, you're an idiot.  You're going down there during hurricane season?  Just like that?  Huh?  You're nine miles from town at all?  There's no town there?  There's town, but you get to the end of the road and then you four-wheel to the house.  So it's a pain in the ass going back to town.  So there's all these beach houses, but the only way to get there is to four-wheel on the beach.  It's great.  It's a great spot to get away from everything.  But how would the caddy get there?  The caddy?  Your caddy?  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Wow.  I have to hire blacks to carry it.  Jeez.  My God.  No cell service, which was very enjoyable.  Not for me.  Yeah, clubster to caddy.  And he's losing his mind that he couldn't get in touch with Opie every 15 minutes.  Yeah, because he had so many questions about the PNC Arts Center show.  I finally turned on my phone like a week later or whatever, five, six days later.  There are so many messages from Kenny.  I don't even know where to begin.  Yeah.  I don't even know where to begin. 
[01:15:00]  You have 20 messages.  What?  Hi, it's Kenny.  Hold on, Kenny.  Before you comment, we have a song for you from Dave from New Jersey.  Ah.  Who does all the parody songs lately.  He's a good boy.  I like when people have theme songs on this show.  We're finding a place to play this today.  He's doofy and he's dopey.  He sounds a little mopey.  A manservant to Opie. 
[01:15:30]  He's glove soda, Kenny.  He's got his anal checklist.  He starts with Opie's breakfast.  He's on him like a necklace.  He's glove soda, Kenny.  Security.  XPD.  OCD.  Whatever you need, call him.  No wonder Opie adores him.  He wipes out, he's asked for him.  He's glove soda, Kenny.  There you go.  There's Ken.  And he's big like Fred Gwynn, which is good. 
[01:16:00]  Nice creased sleeves.  Although that was the Addams Family thing.  Yeah, it was, man.  Sorry.  I stink.  All those creased, perfectly sharp sleeves.  Thank God he shaved the mustache again.  That was looking awful.  I told him on the way in today, I'm like, Kenny, you got to either grow the whole thing  in during vacation or keep it shaved.  The in-between thing was just God awful.  It bothers everyone.  John Carr was creeped out by that stuff.  Well, kudos to that guy that made up that little jingle. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  He did a good job.  So you were in a panic because you couldn't get a hold of me during break, right?  Yeah.  I mean, you know, life goes on.  I mean, I had business to attend to and I can't make a decision without you.  See, people don't understand.  Because he said that in one of his voicemails and his emails.  Life doesn't go on for me.  When I go on vacation, I know how to take a vacation.  I turn everything off.  Done.  Really?  I'm away from everything for a week.  Recharging the batteries.  Yes.  And he's like, no, business still goes on. 
[01:17:00]  I'm like, no, it doesn't.  That's why you take a vacation.  I like having enough input where if there is an emergency, then I can know.  And, you know, I need I need cell access.  Were you online?  You have a computer?  I brought the laptop, but I really couldn't get a signal.  I got on every once in a while.  Just a quick little thing.  I need all that.  A quick little check.  When I go on, like, a cruise or something, I bring a satellite phone.  So that I can, I mean. 
[01:17:30]  You don't think they have that on the boat?  Oh, yeah, for $8,000 a minute.  Ooh.  Well, I'm saying, why do you bring a satellite phone?  Because then if you're not on the boat, if you're on one of the islands.  That's right.  Then you have your satellite phone.  I mean, you could talk.  To who?  James Bond.  To anybody.  I don't want anyone calling me on vacation.  Actually, it was during a lot of negotiations that were going on.  And I was just keeping in touch with Super Agent Bob Eatman via satellite phone.  That was your excuse to your girl.  I need it.  I need a satellite phone. 
[01:18:00]  I need the one they had in Jurassic Park.  I need that.  Now, I didn't need the night vision goggles.  You were right.  But they were handy to have to look at the people having sex on their balconies.  How about a samurai sword?  I didn't take that.  Anyway, well.  You can do that, by the way.  You can relax.  I can't do it.  He just hangs out and, like, won't.  I don't know how to do it.  Because I have to recharge.  None of that.  I hook up a camera at my house.  And then I can log online.  And I pan around my house to make sure that there's no people that shouldn't be around my house in my house. 
[01:18:30]  You set up, like, a little teddy bear in a certain way with something on the hand.  No.  So if it moves.  It's a camera.  And I have my computer set up so I can make it blast noise out of nowhere.  To scare people away.  And I'm sure you did that.  Yeah, I did.  Old Hitler speeches.  They're blasting through his empty mansion.  Why does it have to be a Hitler speech?  He scares people away slash inspires him.  I can't wait until somebody hacks into that, by the way, and is able to look into Anthony's house when he doesn't know it. 
[01:19:00]  And catches whatever it is that gets him off section.  It's creepy and there's a Nazi paraphernalia involved with it.  There are many security blocks in between the camera and me.  Oh, okay.  I know.  What's the code?  I'm not telling you.  You'd punch in and watch me.  I'd see the camera go, focus on me.  Yeah, you know I have to work harder.  The code is 8-8.  Ooh.  Why is that?  Some people will figure it out and they'll write it on the instant message thing. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, and you're making a rumor thing.  No, 8-8.  You know, H-H, 8-8.  Oh, I got you.  That old gag.  Right, right.  Every white supremacist should know that.  Thank you, Kenny.  Can I tell one more story from Saturday night?  Oh, boy.  It's always a pleasure when you're on the microphone.  Good.  I just got to thank the sucker that bought us breakfast at the diner after PNC.  Sucker.  Oh, he was a nice boy.  Yeah, Brian McCarron.  He was very nice.  He picked up the tab for us. 
[01:20:00]  For like 12 people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a big fan and he picked up the tab at the diner, Brian McCarron.  So thank you, sir.  Thank you, Brian.  It was very good.  And the chef allegedly was a big fan that gave half of us food points.  Right.  Thank you for that.  Did anybody else get sick?  No.  There, one of us got sick.  Wow.  Brian, the people pleaser.  You know what the greatest part about that was?  This was really late at a diner somewhere in Jersey and the guy picks up breakfast for  all of us.  And then stupid Voss is like, I was going to pick up the tab.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  He has to tell everyone that he was going to pick up the tab.  Stop.  Voss is a fool.  Has Voss ever picked up a tab?  Has he?  Yeah, but never with a lot of people.  Not a lot of people.  Voss will pick up a check if it's you and him.  And it's like, if there's a drive-thru involved, Rich will pick up a tab.  But there's more than one course.  He's, you know, no, it's your turn.  He's generous to me.  He's given me gratuities.  He's been generous to me.  Yeah.  So really fast.  So on vacation in the Outer Banks, I discovered down the beach about a half a mile, one of 
[01:21:00]  those giant turtles laid her eggs.  Oh, wow.  So basically, this is a big thing down there.  They have websites and they train people.  Because if this happens in front of your house, then you pretty much have to go into  training to deal with it.  Because then they set up like...  Kidding me.  They set up police tape and everything.  Basically, the turtle comes in from the ocean, lays her eggs, and then she's gone.  She could care less what happens to the turtles.  Yeah, don't they bury the eggs?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  And then months later...  So then the police, you know, roll out the police tape and then the locals, there's a  website and everything.  They get together and now they watch the nest for two months.  Wait, what's the training on how to set your video camera up when you run through with  a bat and have a few laughs and make turtle soup?  Is the turtle Dominican?  They got some environmentalists down there for sure.  So wait, the turtle lays the eggs on the beach, this big fat lazy turtle.  Yeah.  And then takes off.  How many are there? 
[01:22:00]  Anywhere from 80 to 120.  Oh, all right.  And only one in a thousand make it to adulthood.  Really?  So pretty much the whole crop of like 10 turtles don't make it.  So then these people, because they usually hatch at night, so anywhere between midnight and  I guess dawn.  So they sit out there with their dumb chairs and their lanterns and their little blankets  and they watch the nest.  So the birds don't get to the nest or the people.  But isn't this like nature?  Yes, it is.  It's supposed to be the birds getting to the nest. 
[01:22:30]  And, you know, what about the poor starving birds?  It's an endangered species.  So now they're trying to help it along.  As opposed to letting it go.  And then they dig a trench even from the nest all the way to the ocean.  What's the trench do?  I'll tell you why, though.  Because, you know, the people are effing up the turtles because they're doing the four  wheeling on the beach, making these trenches.  It's impossible for these tiny little baby turtles.  Oh, to get up and over there.  That's like climbing a mountain to them.  Like a frogger.  Frogger.  Yeah, right?  It's like Frogger.  So they help them along by making this trench. 
[01:23:00]  So they keep the trench clear just in case.  Nice and level.  And when we were down there, we were walking down the beach every day to see what was going  on with the baby turtles.  Do they turn over the ones that go on their back?  Oh, yeah.  They help them along.  Oh, see.  When they start hatching like crazy, then all the locals come out and start shooing them  and helping them to the ocean.  It's a big thing, I guess, down there.  You've got hillbillies.  Oh, look at them go.  Big excitement.  Meanwhile, every time they see a black guy, they call the police.  So I pulled like a Ron Bennington. 
[01:23:30]  You're going to fry the turtles.  Yeah.  I had my Ron Bennington delivery.  So the turtles were easily a week late.  Yeah.  They were supposed to hatch anywhere from 55 to 70 days.  And at this point, it was up to 60 some odd days.  Uh-oh.  And the locals are there all sitting around hoping with their little hot chocolate and  their Afghans and their lanterns.  Where's the baby turtles?  And I look at the nest.  I go, ah, you know, they're dead. 
[01:24:00]  Ah, the baby turtles are dead.  They got to be dead.  It's too long.  It's been too long.  I think the mother turtle laid some water heads.  They were not amused.  Can't they dig one up and see how they're doing?  Well, yeah.  But they have signs posted because, you know me, I want to see what one of these things  looks like before it hatches.  Federal offense.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Jail time.  Something like a $250,000 fine, I believe, if I read that correctly. 
[01:24:30]  Wait, how do they know?  Let me ask you.  You lay the eggs.  The turtle lays the eggs, are they above ground or under?  Under.  How do they know?  Huh?  How do they know the turtle did it?  Well, they see little turtle prints?  They actually watch the turtle.  This one particular home watched the turtle come out of the ocean, and these things are  massive.  Are they big, huh?  And then they lay the eggs and they cover them up themselves, but then, of course, they  have to cover them up a little nicer, the locals.  Better.  Make it completely flat so you can see when they're starting to hatch because then the sand starts  collapsing, I guess. 
[01:25:00]  Ah.  It would have been a cool thing to check out, I guess.  Would it?  But it didn't happen.  I would have, I tell you, I would have four-by-four'd right over those dummies.  Oh, yeah.  That stupid big one, I would have kicked onto its back and laughed at it.  I would have made you a three-pound omelet every morning.  Yeah, a bunch of little turtle eggs.  I would have sold a little feet.  Well, yes.  Hoo-hoo Higgy from the Jersey Shore isn't one of Opie's favorite sayings.  Not all of the baby turtles make it to the ocean.  Yeah.  That is one of my favorite sayings.  That's the meaning of life. 
[01:25:30]  Not all of them.  And I used to watch Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  And they would show the turtles walking, you know, doing that little flappy walk.  And some of them would be on their back.  And then, you know, they'd say, ah, some of them don't make it.  Right.  And you're saying, you know, why can't they?  Yeah, but then they turn the cameras off and they help them.  Do they?  Ah, yeah.  It's more dramatic to see a little baby turtle on its back.  Mm-hmm.  Suffering.  You don't think they let them die, a little turtle?  Nah.  Die, the sun beaten down.  No, because now it's in a game.  Well, I've seen on those shows, too.  You see, like, the dead turtle. 
[01:26:00]  Okay.  It goes, this is part of life.  It's a prop.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's a prop.  It's a prop turtle?  Yeah.  It's an endangered special effects turtle.  They're getting all the baby turtles in the ocean now.  What about the birds that swoop down and, what do they, get brooms and start, like,  shooing the birds away?  Oh, shoo, shoo.  Because I've seen the seagulls come down and grab the turtles and fly off with them.  They told me they set up all sorts of sirens when the turtles are being born to keep the  birds away.  It was a whole thing.  Because I was talking to the lady, like, this is ridiculous. 
[01:26:30]  They're just watching a nest for days on end.  That's what you want to be born into is a turtle, a big police siren.  That's encouraging.  You're trying to just hang out in the ocean, perhaps eat some kelp.  Or whatever it is those little faggot turtles do.  Oh, I would run through there with a bat and play batter up with turtle bodies.  And I would smash those fat hillbillies sitting around in their dumb lawn chairs.  Chairs, not cheers.  Cheers.  You'd just be horrified.  Smash the cocoa right out of her fat hand.  Why don't you help somebody?  Help a person. 
[01:27:00]  Fat do-gooder.  The little turtle might come out.  Yeah, really?  Will it?  Yuck.  It was that and the wild horses, so I had a good vacation.  They saw some wild horses.  Outer Banks, they just have wild horses wandering around.  Still have those.  I don't know how they survive or anything.  I don't get that one at all.  Yeah.  How do they do that?  And they're all freaking hung and have no problem showing you.  Horses, well, yeah, what they say about horses is very true.  I've seen footage.  They are amazingly...  But they have no problems...  I mean, you will be driving down the beach and there's a horse sitting there with a... 
[01:27:30]  Just...  Excited.  Yeah.  Exactly.  But they stand in such a way they want to show it off.  I swear to God.  Wouldn't you?  I swear to God they're showing it off to the locals and the people driving down the freaking beach.  A pair of NBA shorts pulled down.  I don't know how that is happening, but they're just wandering around these horses in between houses eating your grass and they survive somehow.  What is wrong with these people? 
[01:28:00]  It's a beach.  Huh?  It's a beach.  Yeah.  With a lot of houses at this point.  Who'd you stay with?  Chaka and Will?  I almost hit one on the way home from town, though.  Oh, boy.  In the middle of the night.  That'll cost me.  I had a jam on the brakes on the sand to...  A turtle or a horse.  Yeah.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Imagine hitting a turtle on horseback, what that would cost you.  Well, can you imagine if, what's his name, the movie producer lived there, you'd get in the bed, there'd be a little turtle head. 
[01:28:30]  He'd have a little speck of blood on his toe.  Johnny would never get the part.  A turtle does not get that picture.  Art Doon.  Where's Art Doon?  He's under the sand.  I would have had turtle soup and money from the glue after I smashed a horse skull.  I would have stayed rent free.  Don't be naked on a horse with a turtle shield and a sword.  What the hell are you doing?  An afghan as a cape.  What?  Vacationing where you got to watch out for these things. 
[01:29:00]  I was just kind of surfing for the whole week.  Just hanging out.  You was surfing?  Well, like, you know, the wimpy way.  What's that?  Boogie boarding.  Think that body comes from nothing?  You boogie board?  Dude, I was boogie boarding.  I brought a brand new board.  I brought a brand new board.  The waves were pretty cool down there.  You had a professional boogie board?  And I thought I was looking pretty cool.  And then these, like, 12-year-old girls come out from the house next door, and they're surfing.  Like, really surfing.  I'm like, I'm a dork. 
[01:29:30]  So where's this paradise?  Where do you go see middle-aged med boogie board with turtles?  Right.  And 12-year-old girls and horses.  Yeah, 12-year-old on an acid trip?  12-year-old girls showing you up.  Of course, they're not leaving court prints in ruts in the sand.  John Carr shows up because all the parents are looking at turtle eggs.  Oh, he scoops up these little surfers.  Right.  He mistakes Opie for a little boy on a boogie board.  John Carr equals always funny.  You had a boogie board. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, I did.  How much does a boogie board go for?  Like, $19.99?  No.  Is it a plastic one or a real good fiberglass one with flames on it or something?  Well, you're in a vacation area, so it was $175.  Oh, probably for, like, nothing.  Tell me you didn't have the ankle thing on your ankle.  No, no.  When you boogie board, it's on your wrist.  And mine is spring-loaded, so when a big wave takes your board, you know.  Wait, what is a boogie board?  What's the difference between that and a surfboard?  Around 35 years. 
[01:30:30]  Boogie boards are shorter, and you kind of lay down on it.  The difference.  That's fun.  Anyone can boogie board.  Yeah.  Very few can surf.  Right.  I can't boogie board.  I'm too heavy.  If you're too heavy, you can't boogie board.  Surfing is very difficult.  Boogie boards, it's a little heavy.  Is that the language you're using now?  If you boogie boarded, there'd be another tsunami.  Wow.  Wiped out 200,000 loatians, whatever they were.  Wow.  It looks like fun, though.  There it is.  Look at the little kid boogie board. 
[01:31:00]  That's not a boogie board, you ask.  That's a skipper.  That's a skipper or a skimmer.  That's your hard drive, Eric.  It's a young eight-year-old with a little board and a pair of shorts.  Show the fat chick the boogie board fun at...  Really?  That picture's illegal.  That you just showed.  You pulled it up from the wrong file, stupid.  It's like Gary Glitter.  Yeah.  J.O. Fun is not the file we were looking for.  Young lad on a boogie board or whatever it is he's standing on.  Standing on a board of shattered dreams.  Can you open the fat chick one? 
[01:31:30]  Oh, you're trying to?  Yeah.  Open it before your face gets slapped.  See, the difference between boogie boarding and surfing, when you go boogie boarding, you  make sounds like this.  Whee!  Right.  It's fun.  Yeah, well, you know what?  You don't make sounds.  As you're a man.  No, surfing, you're too busy concentrating.  Yeah, looking at chicks, we're looking at you.  Right.  Freaking 12-year-olds, man.  Boogie boarding, you're up to your waist, and you're waiting for a wave.  Worrying about sharks.  When it comes in, you jump on your chest.  Actually, my boogie board was on sale, and I couldn't figure out why, right? 
[01:32:00]  And then I'm in the water, and I'm like, of course it's on sale.  The bottom is white.  Oh, is it?  Is that bad?  Real bad.  Yeah, you look like a seal.  Yeah.  Seals are white?  On the bottom...  They are.  They've gotten away.  You're a creep, and you watch A&E, and Biography, and every other freaking...  Those seals are pretty dark.  But his had fake flippers on it.  No, no, no.  That's...  They're figuring out...  They're figuring out that sharks attack surfboards and boogie boards that are white underneath, 
[01:32:30]  because, you know, when they're looking up at you, you look like a seal.  Bob Kelly's right.  It's full of halibut blood.  Of course Bob Kelly is right.  Look at the way he's built.  Whenever he's on the ice, he has to be careful when he goes to the island, scoops up a little  fish.  Stupid whiskers.  Smash your otter face with a rock.  You're a hairy otter.  You're like a Lebanese otter.  That would make me sick.  Boogie boarding sounds like fun. 
[01:33:00]  Please tell me that at least you wore, like, white spandex.  Something really creepy.  Did you wear something that was embarrassing to walk out of the water in?  Nah, not really.  Now, if you brought Norton, would they try to protect him as soon as he got there?  This one's lost his shell.  Roll him back over.  Oh, look, a talking tortoise.  What, guys?  Boogie board.  Did you have a little bodysuit on? 
[01:33:30]  Nah, nah, nah.  Like a wetsuit?  Yeah, I don't play.  Isn't it cold?  Isn't the water cold over there?  No.  It's not like Florida.  It's North Carolina.  Yeah, it's North Carolina.  No.  It's like 10 miles from here.  It's still cold.  It's not cold in the water around New York.  It is.  No, it's not.  I need Caribbean water.  I need it to be like 90 degrees to go in.  Nowhere it's cold is up in Massachusetts.  They have all those great beaches on Cape Cod, but you can't go in the water.  It's freezing.  It's like, yeah, swimming in ice water. 
[01:34:00]  It's awful.  Well, even California's water.  Southern California is cold.  The water around L.A. is the same way.  The beach water around L.A. is very cold.  How many people are in the water around L.A. or whatever on the coast because the water's  too cold?  Yes.  Around here, no.  I don't know.  Anywhere north of like Miami, I don't want to go in the water.  Were there any kids around when you boogie board?  Yeah, and a 12-year-old.  No, like with you?  Oh, yeah.  I was doing it with like an 11-year-old and a 13-year-old.  That's cool.  That's cool.  Yeah.  11-year-old.  Yeah, yeah.  Were you high-fiving if you could? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Well, we got a good one?  Yeah, we did.  Look, look, look.  This one.  This one.  This one.  This one.  Actually, people were very impressed until the stupid girls came out and showed me  up.  Did their parents start yelling, come here, over here, on this side of the beach?  Stay away from him.  It's like the creepy guy in Jaws who approaches the kids before he gets his leg bitten off.  And then I had kids okay over there?  And then some lady was taking my picture, and I'm thinking, wow, that's cool.  I must have, I must look really cool in these ways.  And then I realized, no, she's never seen a grown man on a boogie board before. 
[01:35:00]  And she wanted to show the locals.  No, she's going to print out Predator on there and put it on the phone poles.  She wants to match you up against websites.  Oh, don't.  Damn, that's creepy.  I had a great time, and I looked like a dork.  I know it.  Hey, why don't we take a break?  We got Ralphie Mae.  We got to talk about the Emmys.  We got to talk about Dick Clark before we get out of here.  Everyone saying how courageous it was to see Dick Clark during the Emmys last night.  It was just downright creepy, and no one's willing to admit that. 
[01:35:30]  I heard he sounded better.  That's what they're trying to say.  Other people say he sounded worse.  That's what they're trying to say.  Do we have the audio from New Year's?  Maybe we could compare.  Iraq, we got that?  All right.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Ralphie Mae is going to join us.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  You got a war face?  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face!  Now let me see your war face!  No!  You didn't convince me!  Let me see your real war face!  No! 
[01:36:00]  You don't scare me!  Work on it!  Jackass.  You're coming in there, Dave.  I'm scared.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:36:30]  We say hi to Vegas today.  Bob from Rockaway, New Jersey, not happy with us.  Is he right now?  What happened?  Let's get a call in, man.  I don't mean to, like, piss people off.  Bob from Rockaway, give us a call.  Bob, you're annoyed at someone.  Instead of hiding behind your keyboard, give us a call.  He writes on the instant feedback.  You guys are so cool.  I love how you use your cool voices and make sure how lame it is to protect endangered species.  Such fags, aren't they?  I can listen to you guys all day making fools of yourselves. 
[01:37:00]  That is true entertainment.  Well, as long as he's listening.  Absolutely.  Dude, I think you misinterpreted.  Don't be a coward and just write it.  Call in.  You're not going to get trashed.  Just, you know, if you want to say something, man, call up and say it.  You don't have to write it, bro.  Make sure how lame it is to protect endangered species.  Yeah, see if he calls in.  I mean, what else?  He's right.  I mean, we are just kidding around.  It is important to protect endangered species.  Yeah, oh, yes.  So, Bob, if you want to call in, you know, feel free.  We're just trying to make jokes. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, dude.  We understand it's only cool to make fun of the Republicans and the conservative monster machine,  but we're just trying to go with another ideology to tease a little bit.  But sorry, dude.  Throw in a little 9-11 conspiracy in there, man.  Yeah, all the fun stuff, right?  You shouldn't make fun of a bunch of people who ignore other human beings and sit around  looking at a sand where turtles are allegedly buried.  Boy, let me move to that place, and I will say, yeah, I saw one.  Bury it.  And I will just have them all sitting around.  And you know what?  My logs will be in there. 
[01:38:00]  And they'll dig them up, and they'll get a sandy surprise.  That's hilarious.  Oh, wow.  Ralphie Mae.  We're gay porno tapes.  You're very gay porno tapes.  And I don't know.  The police all rope off the area, and they dig it up, and there's a bunch of people with  old Club Soda Kenny moustaches doing awful things to each other.  How funny would that be?  I can't even pretend.  Ralphie Mae in studio to join the program.  Hey, everybody.  Hey, we got Bob Kelly on Fox 25 up there in Boston.  We talked about this before vacation. 
[01:38:30]  You went on to promote your gigs up there.  I heard it went real well.  Yeah, every show pretty much sold out, except for the 6 p.m.  But who does the 6 p.m.?  6 p.m. show.  It's your time, Mr. Kelly.  It's your time.  Yeah, it was great.  Thank you so much.  Well, here's Bob Kelly on Fox 25.  He called us as he was waiting to go on TV, and I think it was Anthony who suggested that  you make a John Carr reference.  I was actually Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Wait, were you?  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I thought you were in Houston. 
[01:39:00]  He apologized for, like, accusing Anthony, for giving Anthony the credit for making  the 6-year-old murderer reference.  I'm sorry.  I thought that was weird.  I'm sorry.  You've got to give credit where credit is due.  I thought he said the child killer thing.  You're the awful human.  Okay.  Only on this show would that murder an apology.  It's not even a filter.  We don't even think that way.  Like, oh, man.  Because we just know it was funny.  And your cool radio voice, man.  It's a part of endangered species.  Man.  Look at turtles. 
[01:39:30]  Do ya?  Ooh, a pair of boots when I straighten them out.  Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.  Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh.  Crunch, laugh, crunch, laugh.  Crunch, laugh.  Who is this maniac?  Gay porno tapes.  The little turtles must be dying.  Wait.  What is this?  Say.  How bad off would the human race be without these turtles? 
[01:40:00]  Like, I just want to know.  I know there's a whole chain of events.  Believe me, I know the whole chain of nature.  The whole thing from the littlest cell up until a giant elephant.  That's your gig.  I have no problem with people trying to help the animal.  No, no, that's fine.  I mean, I'm just, I'm not saying let's go kill the friggin' turtles.  I'm not saying let's go kill the turtles.  Well, I am.  I'm saying, I know Jimmy.  Turtles and AIDS.  Get rid of both.  I'm just saying.  Wow. 
[01:40:30]  I'm just saying.  What, where, where, where would we be, negatively speaking, without these turtles?  There wouldn't be so much crappy Hawaiian art, you know?  All right.  See, there you go.  All right.  And rabbits would win more races.  Aside from that, these faggot animals contribute nothing, and they're slow.  There's only one in a thousand make it, okay?  999 are killed by nature, and you're worried for me not helping the one. 
[01:41:00]  Not helping.  As we sit back and ridicule endangered species like they're listening.  Like they're out there in the ocean going, oh, sons of bitches.  I can't believe they're throwing me under the bus.  We did very well with turtle.  Yeah, right?  That's the skew.  Hey, let's have a little bit of help.  Turtles, by the way, excuse my interruption.  I got to say this about turtles.  They suck as pets.  I had one.  I said, fetch the paper, and he just came back with it, and it said Kennedy shot.  They're slow, worthless animals.  That's right. 
[01:41:30]  You made a Kennedy shot reference.  Paper being delivered to me from five years before I was born.  I'm 15.  I'm 28.  I went with the first space shuttle exploration myself, but it worked.  It worked.  All right.  I like the canary thing.  All right.  Here we go.  Something Dewey beats Truman, perhaps, might have been a little too old.  Tippy canoe.  But he's a real slow turtle.  How slow is he?  Bob Kelly on Fox 25.  Oh.  A whole slapping thing went on with Gene Comanche, and also the John Carr references. 
[01:42:00]  Let's listen in here.  Why would it work?  I'm going to miss Stan.  Bobby Kelly making his own name.  You get a chance to see him tomorrow on Saturday night at the Comedy Connection at Daniel Hall.  He's part of Dane Cook's deal, and he's joining us this morning in our Fox 25 studios.  Great to see you, Bobby.  Thank you.  How you doing?  I've been hanging with Dane Cook these days.  It's like running with Elvis, isn't it?  He doesn't call me anymore, dude.  I don't talk to him.  He's hanging out with Jessica. 
[01:42:30]  I think he's done a movie with every pretty Jessica in the business, and I'm doing the  Comedy Connection this weekend with Jay Davis.  Well, I was glad you guys weren't speaking terms here.  I don't know.  He's kind of being restrained over there.  Well, no, Jay Davis from the show.  Come on on and take my spotlight again.  But he was actually very, we got into a lot of fights, and I yelled at him a lot on the  show, and I'm sorry, and I...  That was a bitch blast, wasn't it? 
[01:43:00]  He did.  Are you out of your mind?  Who came out and slapped you?  Jay Davis.  Jay Davis.  Jay came out of nowhere and just smacked you right in the face.  He smacked me in the face.  He struck a blow for every paid member in a comedy club who has watched Bob Kelly.  God bless him.  Thank you, Jay.  By the way, Art from Boston called me out.  He goes, Opie, Gene Cavanchi.  I know it's Gene Cavanchi, but I wasn't thinking when I read it off the desk. 
[01:43:30]  Gene Cavanchi.  I said Gene Cavanchi because it's written that way, and I do know better.  It is Gene Cavanchi.  I'm sorry.  All right?  All right, Art.  Jay Davis came out and slapped you, dude?  Yeah.  Why?  Because you wouldn't do Miyagi's?  What's going on?  What happened?  You wouldn't do his bringer show?  What's going on?  I love the fact that Opie just stops the program.  Listen, you jerk.  Well, they pick up on everything.  It gets frustrating after a while.  And I do know it's Levanchi, but it was written differently. 
[01:44:00]  It's the first day back from vacation.  I'm a little slow.  By the way, Ant just bought a paper and hit me right in the groin.  You know what?  Who couldn't have done it?  That blind 13-year-old could have done it.  He's such a luscious target.  All right.  So Jay Davis comes out.  Jay Davis.  Jay Davis.  Jay Davis and Gene Cavanchi.  And Von Valkowski.  Right.  Came out with Stan Neely.  Happy Ray.  Bob Kaluli.  Larry Bidberg. 
[01:44:30]  Say, Ralphie June.  How is it?  All right.  Jimmy Notano.  All right.  You're killing me.  So did you slap Jay?  I wound up slapping him back, yeah.  That gets good.  And then Gene Levanchi gets involved here.  Are you out of your mind?  Yeah, you just bitch slapped me on Fox 25.  We have, wow.  I'm from Medford.  I'll beat the crap out of you.  Where's he from?  He's from Hollywood, Florida. 
[01:45:00]  You know who I am.  You know who I am.  Mo Green?  Mo Green, god damn it.  I slapped Jay Davis when you were banging cheerleaders.  What, could you have picked a tougher target, Bob?  Oh, wait, he slapped you.  I'm sorry.  I was just thinking you slapped Jay Davis.  Jim Nortano.  Sorry.  I made an error.  All right.  I made an error.  Here's Bob Kaluli doing his John Carr references during his appearance on Fox 25.  A news program, by the way.  He's notified security. 
[01:45:30]  He's actually, him and John Carr are actually working the show this weekend.  So, yeah.  It's going to be a good two comics.  Fantastic guys.  So funny.  He's funny.  John's funny.  They're unbelievable.  But you're loving life now.  I mean, this has got to be big.  How does he get past him?  He's a news guy.  And this was at the peak of that story.  It was the day of, I think.  The day of.  John Carr's name popped up every three seconds on every newscast.  You bring him up as a comic you're working with.  He was on the TV in front of us. 
[01:46:00]  And talk about how fantastic he is.  And you're saying, look, John Carr's going to stop by and kill six.  That's going to be great.  I call him John.  I don't think I know him.  Like, has anybody noticed that John Carr looks exactly like Doug Stanhope?  Anybody freaked out by that at all?  And it does.  It really does, dude.  He really does.  I wonder if Doug had a one-nighter in Boulder that night.  You know, I'm looking into it.  They think it was actually him because they found that John Bonet was killed. 
[01:46:30]  They found a Garrett and a Man Show DVD.  A girl's gone wild.  Young girl's gone wild.  What's your love and life now?  I mean, this has got to be bigger than you thought it would be.  I mean, you always hoped that it would be big.  You're actually bigger than I thought you'd be.  Well, I didn't play hockey.  How's that?  I thought you were smaller.  You're thin.  You look gone from TV.  I get that a lot, that I look smaller.  Yeah, you're a lot bigger.  I was going to say, I was going to kind of bust your chops a little.  But now you have these rounded shoes.  You look like a retired superhero. 
[01:47:00]  How many connects you?  How many are you?  How many are you?  How many are you?  How many are you?  You're killing the staff.  You're killing it.  The cameraman's laughing.  They were way down in the pit, down the bottom.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it was going to be a nice, boring interview again.  Because they probably goof on him all the time.  Oh, this guy.  They're probably not allowed.  Retired superhero.  They're probably not allowed to goof on him.  That is funny.  They're loving it.  Retired superhero.  Someone else does it.  How many connects you?  How many are you?  How many are you?  How many are you?  How many are you?  How many are you?  I got a 6 p.m. show that I got to sell.  I like where we're going with this.  I kind of like that.  Yo, come on.  Do it.  Do it. 
[01:47:30]  Come on, you whiff.  I'm really trying.  I have gopher elbow.  There we go there.  That's my mic hand.  That's my mic hand.  Your mic hand is that what you're calling it now?  What if I just smashed you?  I picked up an ashtray and I was going to...  I honest to God, I had to hold everything back in my life.  You ever get something and you're just like, just do it.  Just hit him with...  I had an ashtray and I was going to smash it over his head.  And it was huge.  It was a really big ashtray and I was like, just do it.  You'll go down in history as smashing Gene LeVangie with an ashtray.  And at the last second, I went, yeah, and I put it back down. 
[01:48:00]  But then you slap Jay back here.  Oh, Jay comes back.  Like my friend Jimmy used to actually.  My friend Jimmy used to...  You go to Jay, Jay?  What?  Don't ever cut me off.  You know what I mean?  Can we see that video again?  Yeah, no, it was actually...  That was the show, Torgasm, that you don't know me from.  He had no idea.  He had no clue.  He had no idea who I was.  That's hilarious, Bobby.  He had no idea who I was.  It was so obvious.  I just said one thing.  He didn't even...  Jay, I go, Jay... 
[01:48:30]  Me and Jay fought a lot on the show.  And that's what he said at the beginning.  He goes, you fought a lot.  That's it.  That's all he knows about the show.  That's all he knows about me and the show.  He was in his prep sheet.  You were on a bus.  I tried to give you a plug.  I was going to say little Jimmy Nortano.  And he cut me off.  I was pretty angry at this.  He certainly did cut you off.  Yeah, he did.  Stomped on you.  He cut you off like a wart.  You don't know me from?  I know you from it.  I just go to bed very early.  You do?  Really?  Good for you.  I wouldn't watch it either.  It didn't get good ratings.  But I'm the guy.  Jane was pissed. 
[01:49:00]  There I am right there, protecting Jay.  Right.  And he comes over and laughs you in the face.  Come here.  Look at this, Jay.  This is you right here.  That's Jay.  Right there.  You missed it.  You missed it.  It was off the camera.  You got to come back as we were in tape.  Come here, Jay.  Take two.  Hey, look at this camera.  Don't be flinchy.  Hey.  Okay.  That was a hard one.  Oh, wow.  So you smacked him twice?  Well, I smacked him, but I didn't know they were off camera.  So I called him back and I smashed him again.  And he walked back over.  Yeah, it's Jay.  Oh, God. 
[01:49:30]  Abbott and Costello.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm not going to be the fat one in that.  You should have brought the pies out.  Exactly.  Randy Apollon.  Say.  Now we got Gene and Bob slapping each other here.  What's that little turkey in the queue?  I'm actually...  You guys slapped me.  I'm not slapping me.  No, you're from Mexico.  Come on, bitch.  Slap me.  Oh, shut up.  Jesus.  He really slapped me in the face.  I was kidding.  I learned your improv skills.  You jail?  You can see Robert Kelly tomorrow night performing two shows tomorrow night, 8 o'clock at 10-15. 
[01:50:00]  This is the Comedy Connection Family Hall Saturday, three shows, 6, 8, 15, and 10-30.  Yes.  And we're going to be with him and John Carr and Jay Davis.  Do you want to slap me back to make...  Can I slap you?  Take the glasses off, though.  I don't want to get sued.  Listen.  Oh, yes.  Did you hear that at all?  I didn't hold that.  Yes.  Yes.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  Get me a doctor.  We'll be right back.  What the hell kind of interview is that?  Did he like you? 
[01:50:30]  I wanted to smack so many TV...  Everyone just slapped everyone in the face.  I'm not even kidding you.  The fact that I said me and John Carr...  And he still...  He just keeps talking.  And he said it again.  John Carr.  Carr.  He goes...  I go...  For the K.  He goes, you want to slap me?  I go, yeah, take your glasses off.  And I put my hand like this, like I was going to chop suey somebody.  Chop suey.  And I smacked him so hard, dude.  You don't even know.  I cracked him right in his face. 
[01:51:00]  I was almost scared.  I was thinking, this guy's going to hit me.  Did they say anything after the cameras were off?  No.  All you heard is all his little colleagues were just dying in the pit.  Yeah.  They were dying.  Oh.  Was he cool afterwards?  He was cool.  But I think after, there was a couple of women that went up to him in like suits.  Probably need a little makeup on the side of his face.  You could see that they told him that, you know, he was saying John Carr.  John Carr.  Oh, is that the big thing?  Yeah.  John Carr, you know, child murderer.  No problem.  Alleged child murderer, John Carr. 
[01:51:30]  I said, where'd you learn your improv skills?  John, like jail, like John Carr?  Like John Carr.  I mean, what do you need?  How many hints do you need?  You couldn't mention the guy more.  You want to make a call, a friend?  How many...  You want to lifeline, you jackass?  You even said I got to get out of here and hop into John Carr and go to the next interview.  Before we take another break, let's go to Scheduled Rape from New Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, yeah.  I was at the show, man.  It was amazing.  You guys are all great.  Robert, Jimmy, you're amazing. 
[01:52:00]  Thank you.  Your ass, I saw that.  I was at the Happy's tent over there.  Thank you.  You guys are burnt out over there, man, on this virus tour.  I went to 40 stunt shows and to four cream shows in England, and she's more burnt than  me.  Well, did you have your stroke before or after this last show?  Listen, I want you to put your pests on me.  I'm asking you to do it nicely.  All right, SR.  Thank you.  Okay?  SR, I like the show at the PNC on Saturday.  I like how Ope just wraps it up.  He liked the show. 
[01:52:30]  He liked the show.  All the babbling he did in between.  Pay no attention.  Ralphie is actually with us on this Twitter Center show coming up on the 9th.  In September, the Twitter Center, which is the Philadelphia market.  We're broadcasting at YSP.  We also got Jimmy Schubert.  We got, of course, Bobby Kelly and myself.  We got the great Dom Herrera.  Can I just say something?  Patrice, Bob Saget.  Yeah.  You guys have actually created an alter ego for me because there's like people from  Torgasm know me, Robert Kelly, and then everybody from ONA who's like Bob Kelly.  Bob.  You can type up Bob Kelly and I come up on Google. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  And then Robert Kelly comes up.  Because you are Bob.  You're not a Robert.  Here's what Bob does.  Besides rehearse what he's going to say and then talk to you to sound smart.  Believe me.  I'm going to bite your throat the next time you do.  You know, dude.  I was thinking.  All you got to do is throw in one alternate theory and he just gets angry.  You know, no, dude.  That's not.  Well, no.  We're not, dude.  I like the fact that you teach me stuff I taught you two weeks ago.  I'm not saying I don't do things wrong.  The most ridiculous thing about his whole statement, though, he makes it sound like his name is 
[01:53:30]  Adam and they're calling him Steve.  An alter ego.  Your name's Robert.  Bob.  They called you Bob.  Wow.  Like nobody would recognize you at the Daily Planet.  Wait.  It's Bob Kelly.  There's Robert Kelly.  I don't know.  They're different people.  Hang on.  He's on photo assignment.  Tony, hang on.  All right.  Tony Anthony.  That isn't even the same name, though.  All right.  Whatever.  Robert is the sound of a smart, gentlemanly individual.  Yeah.  Not you. 
[01:54:00]  You're a Bob.  You're not Robert Kelly.  You're a Bob.  That's completely not you.  Exactly.  Bobby Kelly.  I like it younger, too.  I like it Bobby.  Bobby.  Yeah.  Who wrote that poem?  Robert did.  Oh.  Who's that slob over there?  Bob.  Yeah.  Bob.  Who's the one flipping the coin to bang the passed out of a hypnobroad in the corner?  Bob.  That's Bob.  Let Dane Cook give you some class.  We say screw that.  It's Bobby.  It's Bob over here.  I really should have let you guys go to break. 
[01:54:30]  How big is Vicious Circle going to be, dude?  Huh?  How big is Vicious Circle going to be?  It's going to be huge, man.  That's cool.  That's what we want to hear as comedians, to remind that Dane did 40,000 people in one  night.  That doesn't make me shoot myself.  You can do that watching.  Dude, I did watch.  I got to say, I watched Dane film part of that special, the first show.  And it was impressive looking, man.  And the special, I've seen clips of it.  And I really want to shoot him.  I mean, it looked so, it shot so well.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  He's a comedian standing in this sea of people. 
[01:55:00]  And it makes me sick to my stomach.  The guy who shot it actually did all the Aerosmith videos and the Stones videos.  He's amazing.  It's on HBO Sunday night, right?  Sunday night, man.  Vicious Circle.  Monday, September 4th.  It's Monday?  Yes, Monday.  Monday.  I know because I was driving down Sunset, and he's got a building, dude.  Yeah, I saw that.  It's huge.  I was talking to Bill Burr was in the backseat.  We were driving back from a show.  My wife's in the front.  We're all talking about Dane Cook.  And I'm like, dude, I've gotten over it.  I'm not going to hate on it anymore on this. 
[01:55:30]  I'm getting off that wagon like everybody else because they're just bitter.  I mean, we've got a good friend who's just, I mean, he always just berates Dane and just  does an impression of Dane and just everything is, and they're in competition all the time.  And I'm like, dude, that guy, he's got nine movies coming up.  If you're going to hate Dane Cook, you've got a long next four years, okay?  All right?  You've got a real long name.  His billboard is the whole side of a building on Sunset Boulevard.  As I'm talking, as I'm talking, I turn the corner and I see, it's a, I mean, folks, it's 
[01:56:00]  like 24 stories of Dane Cook.  I thought Torgasm was like a show, but it was actually just a really nine-episode commercial.  It is.  It's just circle.  Exactly.  That was a commercial for Dane's show.  We got to take a break.  Dane Cook will be calling us on Wednesday, by the way, to talk about the HBO special.  So we'll continue with Bob Kelly and Ralphie Mae in just a bit.  We got to talk about the Emmys.  Do something current before we get out of here.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[01:56:30]  Stay tuned for more Radio Awesome.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  Yeah.  All right.  Looking forward to it.  Opian Anthony.  The Opian Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opian Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  We should do a little current stuff.  Anyone watch the Emmys?  No.  No.  I did not, but I heard there's a lot of flack about the plane crash beginning with Conan, 
[01:57:00]  which I saw photos of and didn't see.  Yeah, why was there a flack?  It's supposed to be like a goof on Lost or something.  Right, but apparently because the Kentucky plane crash was still 49 people, a lot of people  felt they shouldn't have showed that.  But I think they absolutely should have because it had nothing to do with it.  Yeah, here's the story real fast.  It was meant to be funny, but a fake plane crash during the opening Emmy Awards skit made  many cringe on Sunday, the same day 49 people died in a fiery plane crash in Kentucky.  I don't think they saw it. 
[01:57:30]  That dope used the wrong runway, by the way, right?  Yeah.  That's all it was.  Oh.  Not that it's any less awful, but it wasn't like they crashed like they did in the sketch.  It wasn't like they used the same.  It was a totally different way.  Yeah.  You know, come on, man.  They weren't using actual footage from the crash, so it's like, I mean, it's a joke about  guys who survive a plane crash, not get killed in a plane crash.  Jesus.  They showed one funny part, though, at the end of that, was it?  You remember the Dateline with the pedophile?  Oh, yeah, the Dateline pedophile special.  He came in, that guy walks out, and he goes, hello, Conan. 
[01:58:00]  Hello, Conan.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And he goes, no, I've never done this before.  Really?  He's in here sweating.  Was it really the guy?  Yeah, it was the guy.  Oh, let's get that for the second half of the show on XM to that kitchen.  And then he just runs out of the house and runs out of the street.  Conan O'Brien came for sex.  For sex.  For sex.  He drove 48 miles.  Conan 69 or something.  Brought beer.  Here's the deal.  The prerecorded opening segment began with Emmy host Conan O'Brien boarding a private plane 
[01:58:30]  to L.A.  Asked by a stewardess if he was nervous about hosting the show.  O'Brien answered, nervous, what could possibly go wrong?  And then at that point, the plane then shook and all that crap.  And then the next thing you see is O'Brien emerging from the ocean onto an island.  Yeah.  It was a lost thing.  It was a lost thing.  Why shouldn't they have done it?  Turtle eggs.  No, I guess you should just completely edit it out because something happened.  Come on, stop.  It wasn't done intentionally and you know it wasn't.  So stop begging for apologies.  It was not on purpose.  Yeah, did they pull Jenga ads after the Twin Towers fell? 
[01:59:00]  No.  What does Jenga mean?  Jenga.  That gang?  Jenga.  Jenga.  Yeah, you got to pull out the Jenga.  Jenga, Jenga, I don't know.  They say Jenga when it's at Christmas time, but the rest of the year it's Jenga.  Jenga?  There's nothing on that one?  No, I didn't Jenga.  Yeah, you'll get something.  With that, here's your Emmy recap for the people that care out there.  As expected, there was plenty of glamour and glitz at tonight's Emmy Awards here on NBC.  Top honors went to 24 for Outstanding Drama Series and The Office for Outstanding Comedy Series. 
[01:59:30]  Best Actor in a Drama Series went to Kiefer Sutherland of 24.  Best Actress in a Drama Series went to Mariska Hargitay for Law & Order, Special Victims Unit.  Best Actor in a Comedy Series, Tony Shalhoub for Monk.  Best Actress in a Comedy Series went to Julie Louis-Dreyfus for The New Adventures of Old Christine.  Really?  One Emmy frontrunner, the sexy medical drama Grey's Anatomy, was shut out in tonight's awards.  No.  Was that a joke? 
[02:00:00]  Was that the real, that they were shut out?  Who cares?  Who's Grey?  It's a bunch of shows that are canceled.  By the way, Lisa Kudrow, I haven't even seen Julie Louis-Dreyfus' show.  Lisa Kudrow on The Comeback, there's no way she was better than Kudrow on The Comeback.  Yeah, that was really good.  Which was amazingly well added.  Again, another canceled show.  Of course people didn't like it.  Julie Louis-Dreyfus.  Wasn't her show canceled?  Yeah.  I think all the shows nominated were canceled.  Yeah, all the shows nominated were canceled.  Do we want, the clips that Nathaniel used to bring in, the awful, horrible sitcom clips we would play in, like, this can't be a real sitcom, was from her show. 
[02:00:30]  The comeback, at least, was cringeworthy and really enjoyable.  Yeah, well acted.  Yeah, it was great.  All right, well, Dick Clark made his appearance.  Well, now this is his second public appearance.  He was there on New Year's Eve.  Remember they brought him back?  Jesus, the guy's like a sacana.  Every 17 years he pops up with his stupid half-a-face.  All right, we get it.  You're a courageous gentleman.  They're still calling him the world's oldest teenager. 
[02:01:00]  It's cool.  Really?  World's loudest corpse.  Yeah.  World's most chatty cadaver.  We get it.  Hey, a lot of people thought it was courageous that he was on the Emmys last night.  I think he's turning into Teddy Ruxman.  I don't think he's got anything more to say.  I think they just pop a cassette at him, you know.  Start talking.  A lot of people saying his speech is getting better, though.  Last time we heard him was New Year's Eve.  All right, now this is a good way to tell because the last time I heard him was New Year's Eve.  That's it.  They do this every couple of years, right?  They do this every couple of years. 
[02:01:30]  They drag out somebody who had an affliction, and they come out and call it inspiring, but it's just horrible.  Like Kirk Douglas.  Kirk Douglas.  He came out hard, hard.  It's the death preview.  Yeah.  They do it during the Oscars.  The death trailer.  Yeah.  They bring out some old actor, and knowing that this is the last time he's going to be seen in public.  Jesus.  I hate it when it's just a commercial for Coke, you know.  They're not really dying.  They always got a crack on themselves. 
[02:02:00]  They wanted me to do, read a longer thing, but we'd be here all night.  Oh, I get it because you can't.  Oh, no.  Do they?  No, they do not.  Doesn't it always like that?  Stan's shaking his head like the clip that comes up is exactly what you just said.  Don't you ever wonder, like, you know, these guys are actors.  What if they're just acting?  Wow.  A little pity acting.  Yeah, right?  I want to act like I'm a Pez dispenser.  It's his new show called Burden. 
[02:02:30]  Well, he didn't.  I mean, he got that movie after it, right?  He got that movie after it because he's...  Well, let's listen because we're running out of show.  All right.  Let's listen.  Dick Clark.  Simon Cowell intros Dick Clark here.  There are really only a handful of names recognizable to every generation.  Was it hip to have Simon in a...  Your intro...  Speech is atrocious.  He would be...  Don't talk.  You're awful.  Don't talk.  You're horrible.  Here's why they did that.  And he's right.  Because he would be the only one that would be brave enough to say something about his speech. 
[02:03:00]  Because he's so legendarily awful.  So to have him doing something tender, it kind of shows the underbelly of the shark.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Hollywood is always thinking for us.  Could you please try not to drool upon the winner's name?  I hate Simon Cowell, man.  I'm sorry.  I like my English homos, nice and polite like Elton John, not catty, and wearing too tight  a t-shirt like Simon Cowell.  All right?  You English homo.  Go back, you dirty Brit. 
[02:03:30]  Language.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Sorry.  There are really only a handful of names recognizable to every generation of Teddy V.  Kennedy, God, Jesus, Lincoln, and Dick Clark.  Shut up, Simon.  Your first one out of the box.  Hitler.  Nice.  Let's not forget Osama.  Oh, Solomon.  Who's in love with Whitney Houston, by the way.  That's the latest.  Really?  That's hilarious. 
[02:04:00]  Nice crack.  I'll give her up.  We can send her over.  And Bobby.  Put a little censor on her.  There are two names.  Bing Osama.  Film it and play it on Bravo.  There are some names recognizable to every generation.  There's Hitler.  There's Dick Clark.  And there's Frank Gorshin.  Why don't you shut your mouth?  Come in tune.  There's only a handful of words this man can say.  All right.  Listen, with that, we're running out of time.  We've got to get this in before we move over to XM.  A television viewer. 
[02:04:30]  One of them I'm extremely happy to say right now.  Are you?  Ladies and gentlemen, Dick Clark.  Thank you.  Awful.  Awful.  Thank you, Simon.  Thank you.  Oh.  Thank you very much.  Sounds lazy.  Sit down.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Please.  Please do the love of it. 
[02:05:00]  You've got to sit down.  You've got to go.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Well, not everyone was applauding.  Ah!  Ah!  It sounds like Bob.  Ah!  He was trying to get him to stop clapping.  He got a standing O.  It's just terrific, isn't it, people?  What did he say?  Stop clapping.  I'm going to fall face first into the carpet in 30 seconds.  He does these impersonations.  I swear.  You would think it was the real people.  No, you wouldn't.  All right.  Here we go.  Dick makes a not being able to walk joke. 
[02:05:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  I know the problem of time.  Uh, the Emmy people called and asked if I could walk out and say thanks.  My wife joked to walk.  She's just begun to learn to walk again.  This show might run a little long.  Uh.  Is that her joke?  Your wife stinks.  This might run a little long.  How about a funnier joke?  Walk.  He's lucky he's not dead. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Walk.  He's lucky I don't choke him for drooling macaroni all over my new.  Clap it.  Oh, my God.  We got two minutes left.  All right.  Thanks, Dan. 
[02:06:30]  Damn it.  We got one more Dick Clark clip here.  Before I had my stroke, I was thinking about all of the things I had become involved with  over my life.  Music, comedy, drama, game and talk shows, even reality TV.  Bloopers.  I now realize that I had accomplished my childhood dream.  Oh, it's a penis.  To be in show business.  Everybody should be so lucky as their dreams come true. 
[02:07:00]  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk Mick friend.  I thank you very, very much.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, it was your childhood dream.  To babble like that while Lucky Louie's being ignored?  Then he intros Barry Matalow.  Yeah.  All right.  It goes from words to words.  Yeah, right?  Oof. 
[02:07:30]  It's a combo.  Chester's liver, they won't play a plane crash, but they will have the cripple up there  crashing and burning.  His wife's joke was not very good.  It should have been edgier.  Yeah.  Something.  Mix it up.  Walk.  He hasn't been able to satisfy me sexually in three years.  I've been betting a Negro.  Banging non-mikes. 
[02:08:00]  Wow, that's a little...  Walk.  This flop sounds like he's drowning every time he talks.  All right.  He sounded drunk.  At least Steve has some sympathy.  Maybe he's got a bad problem.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  He sounds like an alcoholic to me.  All right.  We're out of here.  Ralph, are you going to be joining us over at XM?  Yeah, baby.  I'm going to go for the walk.  And then you'll do the show with us tomorrow as well?  Of course. 
[02:08:30]  Bob Kelly, we've got to say goodbye to you because what are you doing?  I don't know.  Why don't you walk with us?  You're doing the Houston...  No, I mean, you're doing the rest of today's show, but I mean...  I'm doing Houston Lap Stop, Bob.  Wednesday, two people are there.  Thursday, there's three people.  And then Friday and Saturday.  No, you're going to kill it, dude.  Lapstop.com.  I'll be in Dallas at the improv.  And if you say Doppcom again, I'm going to smack your face off, Mark.  Doppcom.  Do it.  I'm at Tommy T's this weekend in Pleasanton, California.  It's a new week over there.  We're at the San Francisco market.  You guys just effed up all the plugs because now they don't know... 
[02:09:00]  I know.  ...who to see where.  Bobby's in Houston.  Jimmy's in Dallas.  I'm in San Fran.  All right.  Thank you.  There you go.  Ralphie Mae, everybody.  Give me a kiss.  We'll see you at XM.  If you're not joining us over there, have a great day.  We greatly appreciate your support.  Bye, Vegas.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:09:30]  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment.  Wow.  That is such a long way to go just to say...  It's the Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:10:00]  Bam, bam, bam, bam. 
[02:10:30]  Hello.  You're here.  Of course we're live.  How you doing there, Ralph?  No?  How are you?  You got a working mic or nothing?  Why would it work?  Why would it work?  Mine's working.  I don't know.  Here, you want mine, Greg?  No, I don't.  How about yours, James?  Now it's on.  Now I can't hear Jimmy.  You know, it's just back from vacation.  Try that. 
[02:11:00]  Try that.  There you go.  That's better.  Let's walk.  Can you hear that?  He did his little mic check.  Yeah, it worked.  The mic check worked.  Hi.  Morning.  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, you got to talk about the homeless vomit you just stepped in.  Yeah, I usually go to my little corner.  It's like a little nook in the building or a cranny, if you will.  Pick whatever one you want.  And when I went in there, I noticed it was sticky.  So it's like, I'm like, ew, what the hell is that?  And I looked down, and I was standing in homeless vomit. 
[02:11:30]  Homeless vomit.  So, yeah, thank God it's raining here in New York.  It was a lot of water on the sidewalk.  And it's homeless vomit, so it's like half soup.  Cleaning the soles of my shoes.  Make Kenny clean your shoes, please.  I would never make Kenny clean my shoes.  That is not my bit.  Was it the guy's vomit who we usually talk to?  No, I don't know whose it is. 
[02:12:00]  You can't really dust for vomit.  Hey, Bob Kelly just got recognized on the sidewalk.  Did he?  How did that feel, Bob?  How did that feel?  It felt fantastic.  I tried to play it off, too.  What's up, dude?  How you doing?  He was all casual, but I know inside he was loving it.  I fell off halfway.  I saw him.  I was looking at him the whole way, though.  I'm trying to get people to recognize me.  I keep staring him down without blinking.  I thought they thought it was the M30 bus.  Look, he really is trying to get people to recognize him.  Yeah, he is.  Are you a dame limo driver? 
[02:12:30]  Don't threaten him, Bob.  Know me.  Recognize me.  I'll punch you in your face.  You will know me.  Don't think he was some Dominican.  Oh, I think she knows that.  Bob Kelly, ladies and gentlemen.  Bob Kelly from Torgasm.  Bob Kelly.  On HBO.  From the commercial.  Bob Kelly.  From the commercial.  Robert Kelly.  Robert Kelly from Torgasm.  Oh, that's right.  It's Robert Kelly.  That's right.  Robert Kelly from Torgasm.  Bob Kelly from my hair do.  Look at Robert Kelly.  As a fat man, I just got to applaud you all for walking slow. 
[02:13:00]  Bob.  I appreciate it.  That way you don't hear me just breathing.  Thank you.  I just was watching the Celebrity Fit Club update.  Uh-huh.  And you were looking good on there.  Yeah, baby.  Lost a bunch of weight.  You're eating healthier, right?  Yeah.  Is it really true?  I think we've talked about it on the show.  You really were 800 pounds.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  My wife's actually got some.  I'll send you some pictures.  She took a photo. 
[02:13:30]  She took a lot of pictures of it.  So, yeah, I'll send you some pictures.  800.  No, I don't have pictures of actual 800.  I only have.  It's just water, sweetie.  It's just water, dear.  620.  630.  What happened, Jimmy?  There's water dripping down.  But he panicked.  You all right?  Yeah.  It hit my head full.  It went in my ear.  I thought I'd been shot.  I'm okay.  Jimmy jumped.  Yeah, like a little faggot.  Did you jump?  I was hit two seconds before in the shoulder by the same place that it was dripping. 
[02:14:00]  And it hit you.  And you jumped like a little fairy Mary.  Dude, I thought someone touched me.  No, it hit my earphones.  It went pop.  Disgusting.  Hi, sir.  Again, our homeless friend not here.  Oh, wow.  I think he's dead.  Yeah, well.  Life goes on.  Not all the baby turtles make it to the ocean.  Somebody just happened to shit their pants and be a burden on the other turtles. 
[02:14:30]  Wonderful.  Another fine morning.  People are waiting.  You're waiting for a bus.  Oh.  Jeez, what a prick.  We take limos.  Ha ha.  What a dick.  You see everybody's face.  They went, ah, shit, he's right.  Oh, God, he's right.  Metro card assholes. 
[02:15:00]  But a bus, man.  At least take a cab.  iPods to tune out the fucking depression.  Yeah, just.  To take a crosstown bus.  Just tune everyone out.  No one wants to hear or interact with anybody.  Uh-oh.  Oh, look at Kenny.  Look at Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  Some guy comes up and starts walking towards the office.  It's the homeless guy.  Kenny, profile.  No, it is.  Ugly.  It's the homeless guy.  He's definitely a threat.  Why is your zipper half open?  It's not open.  It's all the way close. 
[02:15:30]  No, it isn't.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  It's down.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  Go.  No, he's down.  It's down.  The horse almost got out of the barn.  Is that a braided belt?  I love those belts.  When that guy came walking over, Kenny just immediately got between him and Opie.  Probably the smartest move.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That is a cool belt, though.  So what else are you going to do now?  It's 1989.  Hey, wait.  Wait for her to do your hair. 
[02:16:00]  What do you got in your hand, sir?  Is that your new CD you're dropping?  No, I would like to have you.  Autographs?  Autographs?  He's here to pick up his member's only jacket.  You want the autograph?  Do you have a Sharpie on your cycle?  What do you want us to sign?  Lamp it up, Charlie Weiss.  Come on.  Help me out.  Let's go.  Come on.  Come on.  Go Irish.  You got Penn, sweetie?  I'll sign it.  I want nothing to do with this guy.  That's why I'm way over here.  I know.  Stay by me.  Dude, look.  Here's what you're doing.  Shots can ring out.  What is this?  Hide in a fold.  You never know.  You can be right in there. 
[02:16:30]  Hide in a fold.  What DVD in your room?  Crystal Ship.  What is Crystal Ship?  They were a cover band.  Yeah, the Doors cover band from Long Island.  Are you friends with those guys?  I'm working with them.  Okay, cool.  Get me something that I can sign.  That is...  Jimmy just launched their CD on the West 57th Street right now.  It's over there in the vomit.  It's only got like 10.  I'll sign something, but you're handing me a piece of hard plastic to sign with a pen, 
[02:17:00]  you may not.  Look at that.  It still works.  All right.  He's brutal.  I actually didn't think that would run it.  Paper inside.  Yeah, let's sign the paper inside.  Jesus, watch out for this truck backing up.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy, throw it under the wheels of the bus.  By the way, how's the chemo going?  Jesus.  Nice come over.  How's that calcium depositing in there?  I know.  He's a bullet.  There's a bullet here, folks.  He's got the bald mullet rocking. 
[02:17:30]  Phenomenal.  By the way, I'm just saying snide stuff out of here.  I'm playing it kind of half a faggy, to be honest with you.  Thanks, bro.  All right.  Let's get inside.  And sign that thing.  Take care, man.  Bye, guys.  Thanks for doing the walk with us today.  This is awesome.  I'm with you, Greg.  Let's get inside, dude.  All right.  The second half of the show starts in moments.  The warmth of the next century.  Messicans. 
[02:18:00]  That sucks.  Lesbians.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and it's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:18:30]  The virus.  The Opie.  And Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:19:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  We're going to be number one with Down syndrome.  guitar solo 
[02:19:30]  guitar solo 
[02:20:00]  I don't know what this is, Opie. 
[02:20:30]  We've walked into a brand new place, it looks like.  Why was the money spent on mirrored ceiling in the studio?  Did we ever ask for a mirrored studio ceiling?  What is this?  Why is the ceiling mirrored? 
[02:21:00]  It looks like a strip club from 1985.  See, it's great to be back here at the New York Laugh Factory.  They're trying to make our studio look bigger instead of making the studio look bigger.  They're trying to fool us like we're hamsters.  We've been begging for a bigger studio.  This is their compromise.  Jesus, time to look at everyone's bald spots.  If we mirror the floor, it'll look like we're hanging in space. 
[02:21:30]  Jesus.  Ten years ago, this would have been awesome.  That was just a self-esteem smash.  No kidding.  I know.  It's like...  This was great.  It's like what one of your friends does in his basement, and you're like, wow, this is cool.  Oh, dude, it's going to be the greatest people who smoked me the whole time.  What is this?  Can the Palatine people see this?  I will get that running in no time.  Yeah, definitely do that.  I think there's cameras up in there.  I bet they snuck cameras to make sure to get you guys...  I'm doing shady stuff. 
[02:22:00]  Kenny, I need food or I'm going to pass.  I want some too, Kenny.  Please.  And we'd like it quickly.  I want a smoothie.  I want another bowl of cereal.  I got some blueberries.  And I got a banana.  And yogurt.  And yogurt.  It's going to be a wonderful...  Do you know what I bought, by the way?  I bought some almond butter instead of peanut butter.  Oh, so good.  Pure almonds.  I've never heard of that.  So good.  Thirteen bucks.  Nice.  I didn't know it was that much until I looked at the thing later.  I just spend so much.  It's so good.  It was really good.  Thirteen bucks.  It's really good. 
[02:22:30]  You should come with a chick who feeds it to you and sucks your cock.  People see this?  Yeah, I just put the mirror.  It looks like some wacky video effect.  I can't even really make it look right.  Get it on the thing.  All right.  Let's see.  Hold on.  Stay right there, Jimmy.  Hold on, Jimmy.  I think PT2 is going to have to...  Can we get some Windex for 409 and cuts the grease? 
[02:23:00]  Open2 has got that view.  Oh, God.  Give him a shot of the brown eye.  Why is your ass always red in the middle?  Well, the color on Open2 makes you look like a naked Bart Simpson.  You're like a little yellow ass.  Why is my ass always red?  I don't know.  Clip your fingernails.  You always tell me he has a good one.  Second knuckle.  Oh, wow.  Chase.  Yeah, what the hell is going on with the mirror?  I don't know.  I don't know if I like it or want to set the building on fire. 
[02:23:30]  Can someone explain it to us?  Yeah, explain why it was done.  Who asked for it?  They do some silly things around here.  Like, how much did it cost?  Yeah.  About a thousand.  And I'm wondering why it was used for that instead of maybe something else that we could  have used instead of a mirror seal.  Well, they didn't even, like, I mean, look at it.  There's fingerprints all over the place.  There's DNA over there.  That one.  This one's broken.  Yeah, that one's broken.  They said, oh, we don't have an extra, so just throw that one up there.  It's not really a mirror, though. 
[02:24:00]  It's actually just shiny paper.  It's like a drop ceiling.  Some sort of space-age polymer.  It was actually found in Roswell, New Mexico.  It's very light, but I couldn't bend it.  I couldn't bend it.  When I crumbled it up and then let it go, it went back to its original shape.  Flat.  Did it.  Amazing.  Who wants an XM hat for the rest of the show?  Because I, uh...  Oh, my God. 
[02:24:30]  I'm the only one here who's got a full head of hair.  Was there a reason for...  That bitch.  No one wants to see a college kid with a bald spot.  Oh.  I can't even see this.  I do.  And I tell people, no, it was a motor bike accident when I was 13.  I got hit with a golf ball.  Yeah, I got a big scar.  Golf.  I got hit with a ball.  That was a golf ball.  It was a male part of madness.  It used to be...  It used to be...  I used to look like a skunk. 
[02:25:00]  It was all...  My hair went gray down the middle.  Male pattern baldness is the one I got hit with.  I was driving a motorbike.  Can I ask something else?  Go ahead, sweet pie.  What the fuck is this?  What is that in front of you?  I got, like, the old hotline that went from after the Cuban Missile Crisis, went between  Moscow and Washington.  Every time we go on vacation, they like to give us a nice little surprise when we get back.  Hello.  Ask him for a police commissioner.  Gordon.  Hello.  Hi.  Who is this?  It's Happy Typing Girl? 
[02:25:30]  I told you never to call me here.  You're not even on the air.  Put her on the air.  I'm screening calls.  This is great.  I've just gotten a fucking Travis's job.  That's good.  Quick.  Quick.  Quick.  Travis, you could go home.  Thank you.  Thank you for interning this year on the opening.  That's it.  Well, what do you have for the show today, Happy Typing Girl?  What do you want to talk about?  Sorry, not good enough.  That's right.  Hey, that's a fun job, Travis. 
[02:26:00]  What's your time about?  I don't know.  I just hung up on her.  Let's say hi to Jason in Indiana.  Hey, guys.  Don't ever go on vacation again.  Okay.  I got stuck listening to the worst drivel ever as terrestrial radio here in Indianapolis.  Why didn't you listen to the replays?  Yeah, the replays.  Ron and Fez.  I hear them.  Well, I'm always turning on at noon for Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  I heard the replays were really, really, really good this time around.  They were great, but it was stuff I already heard three or four times. 
[02:26:30]  Okay.  I'm sorry about that.  Hey, another thing, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Did he mess up last night on Lucky Louie on purpose when they called you Jimmy when he was leaving the bench?  Oh, did someone call you Jimmy?  You know what?  Yeah, last night when he got up to leave the bench, he didn't say goodbye, Rich.  He said goodbye, Jimmy.  Dude, that was...  Oh, I love those people.  If that happened...  Yesterday was the season finale of Lucky Louie.  There was a scene where me and Kim have an argument in the park, which, dude, if that happened, if he said goodbye, Jimmy, I did not catch it even watching it, which was very funny.  Yeah, I DVR'd it and I replayed it. 
[02:27:00]  It's also not a good sign.  Hey, bye, Jimmy.  Oh, shit.  Oopsie.  He knows something you don't know.  Thanks for the promise.  He knows your dollars.  Letters to HBO if you like the show.  Put on if you like it.  Fans have written in the show and asked us to stay on.  What's going to happen, Jimmy?  We don't know.  I mean, they said we were averaging, like, I guess, like 1.5 million per live episode people, and they said we would do almost 4 million a week total.  Wait, I'd rather hear this from Upside Down, Jimmy. 
[02:27:30]  Go ahead, talk.  Well, I've been watching...  Just go look in the mirror.  I've been watching...  They say we've been doing, like, almost 4 million people a week, because the critics hate us, and HBO likes critical acclaim.  Yeah.  So it makes it a little bit harder for us.  We would probably be guaranteed if the critics liked us.  You look like a turtle without a shot.  I know I do.  That's why I took interest in that story.  I've never made that reference this morning.  I'm going to hang on to the console and go, like...  Oh, my God.  Did it look like I was falling?  Do we have audio of that, dude? 
[02:28:00]  Did he say goodbye, Jimmy?  Yeah, we'll find it.  Wow.  That was a very funny scene, by the way.  Hey, dude, I'm not just kissing your ass because you're here, but I love that show.  Lucky Louie, it's hilarious.  Thank you.  It makes me laugh out loud all the time, dude.  Thank you.  I've actually laughed watching it, too, and not even my scene, just, like, watching the other act.  I know.  How high was it for last night when she kept saying, pull it out, not to fill up on camera?  Well, she's very sexy, and it really...  Pull it out.  I'll suck it.  That was turning me on.  Dude, she's very loving, too, in real life.  Pam, she's very affectionate.  She hugs you. 
[02:28:30]  She'll put her arm around you and talk.  She's big on body contact, but she's not dick-teasing.  She's just, like, very loving, and it's like she has no idea.  It's like you have no idea what an addict you're dangling this drug in front of.  You're just being loving and being yourself, and you have no idea what you're doing right now.  Girl can't even be sweet.  She's great on that show, man.  Yeah, she's a good actress.  I talked to Louie about it.  I go, because she was cracking me up on the previews.  I was like, where did you find her?  He goes, dude, we had to look at over 1,200 actresses to find somebody like that.  That's what he told me.  She actually got offered another job, too, and she turned it down for much more money to do that. 
[02:29:00]  She got offered a Pam Anderson sitcom and turned it down.  Really?  She got offered a lot more money on network than she would have here.  I saw the table read last night, which you can actually get on demand, which is really interesting.  If you go to HBO Extras or something, you can get the table read of Lucky Louie,  and it sees all you guys before you shot the show doing the table read of every show you do a table.  When I did Dennis Leary's show, The Job, it's kind of nerve-wracking, too.  They say you've got to go down to a theater, and you actually have to go through the script in front of everybody. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  You can tell the bigwigs are there, the casting directors, everybody, and you've got to read your line.  You hope you get a laugh off the line.  They actually show Lucky Louie, which is pretty wild to see that.  They never show that.  Yeah, that's the thing.  They usually keep under the wraps.  People get fired at the table read.  Exactly.  You get the gig, you're happy, you already told your girl, honey, you start walking different like I did.  And then you get fired at the table read. 
[02:30:00]  That's great.  Wow, I didn't know they had that.  Hey, can we get some answers about the mirrored ceiling?  Yes.  Where's Elo?  Can we get Elo on the phone?  Elo, pick up the phone or there's going to be a problem.  That's how you talk to Elo.  They're just trying to make it look like we're in a bigger studio.  I wasn't saying that, by the way.  That was a quote from Pham that I was just reiterating.  Yeah, it's an illusion.  I don't disrespect you, though.  Actually made it smaller with the drop ceiling.  Smoke and mirrors, yes.  More intimate is the word we like to use right here, Bob.  More intimate.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  I'll use that from now on.  I'll be just a size queen.  I'm just thinking maybe the money could have been used for mics, things like that that we need.  Well, Tim's calling in a...  How about advertising?  Tim's calling me out now from...  Good, good.  From Whack Bag.  Why?  Replays were really good.  Opie, they opened Monday and Tuesday's Worst Of's at the same time with the same bits.  Really?  The only one that rocked was the 55-gallon drum challenge replay.  The only one.  Everything else sucked ass?  Is that what you're saying?  I read a...  Fuck stick?  I read a lot on the... 
[02:31:00]  These people.  ...on the fan sites.  And in general, people really liked the material that was played while we were away.  And maybe it isn't people that heard it like before.  I heard that when it first aired.  I heard that already.  You know, there are a bunch of new people listening to this show that haven't heard it.  Maybe you should have taken a little break.  Maybe you should have taken a little break.  You couldn't have said it better.  Turn it off.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Atta boy.  It's a smoothie.  What's taking you so long?  Here's a 20, Ken.  I have a 15-100.  I'm going to give you the 20.  Jimmy.  I'll be back lickety split. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Not a lickety split.  It's hot in here.  Your skim milk is coming.  Thank you.  That's because of the fucking reflectors now that are above our head.  You're like an ant.  I'm glad y'all blame the reflectors and not my fat.  What?  My fatness.  Making it all hot.  You know, when the sun shines in here, you guys are going to melt.  Oh, forget about it.  Once the sun.  You're all going to have cans.  A flashlight will make you all blind.  Where is this?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:32:00]  I thought you were on the Fat Smash.  He has punched himself.  You thought I was on the Fat Smash?  I thought you were Fat Smash.  I did.  I did.  And then I gave up.  Why'd you give up, Bobby?  You're doing great.  Seriously.  I lost 30, 25 pounds, actually.  And then I gave up.  Why, dude?  Don't give up.  Why?  I ate a dessert the other night.  I never eat dessert.  Why?  Because I'm afraid of success.  So throw the bread out and get back on it, stupid.  I'm succeeding.  I have to ruin it.  I mean, you're not doing that well.  You're not doing well enough to stop your heart. 
[02:32:30]  You sold out some shows in your hometown.  Go fuck yourself.  Why don't you throw the bread out?  Obviously, you're not afraid of carbs.  Exactly.  Why don't you eat the tinfoil while you're at a show?  Take a dick and a face for life.  Dude, I'm a mess, but here's what you've got to do.  When you fall off that horse, Bob, or when you're eating like one, you suck it off.  I'm so glad they're making this about Bobby and not me.  Well, dude, I mean, you got the surgery.  You did, you know.  I can't hardly eat anything.  I'd like to.  I'd like to tear into that heart attack on a roll over there. 
[02:33:00]  It's actually low.  Bob, you know what I'm getting?  Here's what I just ordered.  Don't say it's low carb.  It's actually what?  Here's what I just ordered.  I ordered fucking raw almonds.  It's covered in cheese.  It's fried.  You were what?  I ordered raw almonds, fucking low-fat yogurt, a banana, and an apple.  Right.  Believe me.  What did you do last night?  What did you do to fill the hole last night that didn't have nothing to do with food?  Paid a prostitute.  But you know what?  I'm not saying it's healthy.  I'm only saying fat smash.  We're talking about sex addiction.  That's another show. 
[02:33:30]  Right.  But for now, we're talking about eating because you have both, too.  First of all, these are Cape Cod potatoes, which are made.  They're all natural.  Which are fried.  And it says no preservatives on the bag.  I don't know if you know that.  Shut up.  They're all natural.  You don't eat Cape Cod.  Which means it's a healthy fucking potato.  Dude, why don't you have...  That's horrible for you.  Dude, get rid of them.  That would kill Patrice.  Just get rid of them.  Just say no.  I can't.  I already took a bite.  So what?  No.  I got none to eat.  Have fucking egg whites, dude.  Do it.  Just order them.  Just take the bread off, dude.  Let me try a potato chip.  Bobby, you were doing great.  I'll tell you how healthy they are. 
[02:34:00]  Opie, do you think I don't know you?  You were doing great, Bob.  You lost a lot of weight.  You look good.  You don't eat chips.  I eat chips.  No, you don't.  You eat juices.  Blueberries and granola.  You actually love Cape Cod potatoes.  Are they salt and vinegar?  My favorite?  No.  Opie, you motherfucker.  You understand you're like a serial killer.  You turn into a...  Can you help me with this in the back of the bin?  I have a kid.  Would you?  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Sure, I'm going to Albuquerque.  Yeah.  Get in.  See, now you're expecting it. 
[02:34:30]  I don't...  I take the fun out of this.  It's so fun to teabag him.  All right, listen.  First of all, where do you expect us to do bad shit?  I'm not going to do bad shit.  But I'm predictable.  And what are you going to say?  You stepped on it.  You're not beating your fucking chips.  You're not tasty.  What am I going to eat now?  I don't know everything...  Do you really think they're healthy because they're potatoes?  You got a whole sandwich.  No, no, no.  Those are so tasty.  I hope you really thought I was just dumb.  I'm looking at them on the floor.  I want one.  I'll tell you what.  Those are lovely, Bob.  I'm sorry I did that.  Those are lovely snacks.  Really good.  Houston, I want you to have Pete Pirelli take it to Chewy's. 
[02:35:00]  What's Chewy's?  It's a great restaurant.  Shut up and go.  Take it from a fatter guy.  You're not coming to shut up.  You know, I used to have to get up.  Shut up.  Trust me.  Trust me.  When it comes to food...  It's a boss's house.  I used to have to stand up to see the chips.  Elvis chicken, dude.  Elvis chicken.  It's covered in potato chips and fried.  Potato chips?  Yeah.  No one cares.  And cheese is phenomenal.  Where's Elo?  We got Elo.  You want to say fuck it?  That's what you want to do.  Shut up, everyone. 
[02:35:30]  The boss is here.  The boss is on the line.  Elo.  Hey, guys.  Welcome aboard, boss.  Thank you.  Elo, why aren't you on Pal Talk today?  Well, I don't know.  Anthony decided he wanted to bounce me for some fucking time.  What?  You bounced, Elo?  I bounced.  Good boy.  But I took you off the bounce list immediately.  No, it's okay.  I just went ahead and shut down the camera.  Oh, I ruined it.  I ruined your Pal Talk experience for the day.  It was going to be the WAC cam.  I'm sorry, Mr. Lowe.  Elo, did you get my message, by the way? 
[02:36:00]  I did.  Thank you very much.  Well, where's the photos I requested?  It was legendarily rumored that Elo had some Speedo bikini photos of himself.  And I wanted them.  Wow.  Yes.  They're surfing on YouTube.  We have a question.  Yes, sir.  It's about the new ceiling here in the studio.  You mean the ceiling that actually should have been installed and the lights were installed  that just took forever to get in?  What's going on?  Did Bob Kelly just fall off his chair? 
[02:36:30]  Eric, I just helped my friend.  Hi, Bob.  Wait, what?  No, he's on the floor.  What happened?  Scumbag.  What's up?  What happened?  I found a little chelice turtle through my freaking food in the barrel.  Dude, he went to get something.  He threw a little blueberry.  Those are great.  He threw a sandwich in the garbage.  It was as dainty a move as you've ever seen someone make.  And he picked it up by the foil.  He picked it up like it was a dirty diaper.  But.  Tossed it away.  I really, I will buy Bob a healthy lunch.  The reason why I'm laughing is I had a, I dropped egg on the floor and I was trying 
[02:37:00]  to pick it up.  I had to get down like an elephant on one knee.  And then at that moment he came with an intervention.  It was almost a sign from God.  I came up and the sandwich was gone.  Oh, you should have seen it.  He was such a prick.  But I will, I will buy Bob a healthy lunch.  What are you going to get him?  What he wants.  I mean, it's up to him as long as it's.  But what he wants is what's in the garbage right now.  Not enormous, dude.  Bob was doing good.  So you need some help.  You help me with certain things.  What do I help you with?  Drain in my ball bag when I need my cock stuff. 
[02:37:30]  I'm sorry, Eric, let's do it, Eric Logan first.  Yeah, these were supposed to be installed at the same time the ceiling or the lights went  in.  Yeah, you should have seen them when the lights went in.  The last vacation they should have been installed.  Uh-huh.  So there's been no incremental spend.  Was there a reason for the mirror thing?  No.  No.  No, okay.  They were supposed to help illuminate the room.  Oh, okay. 
[02:38:00]  It's part of a lighting scheme.  Makes it brighter.  Yeah.  Let me look.  That's cool.  All right.  Well, what can I say?  Yeah.  It looks like scores, I think.  It does look like an 80 strip club.  I turned on my PalTalk camera, but I can't see it, but that's okay.  Why can't you see it?  Oh, you are cordially invited back into PalTalk.  Invite me, Lowe, please.  So my boss and friend can see this.  I'll log in right now.  Please do.  And if Twinkle or Twinkie2001 IMs me one more time, one more time, you're completely banned. 
[02:38:30]  Just let them know you got that, dude.  Let them know you got that, because otherwise she's going to ban you.  Okay.  By the way, I thought the replays were great this week.  See?  Happy to have us back.  And I'm thrilled to have you back.  He's logging on.  I hear the little sounds.  How was your time while we were off?  Yeah, what did you do?  You sounded a little down today.  It's just been a rough weekend.  I got ground loop here. 
[02:39:00]  Stand by.  There we go.  All righty.  Now we're back.  Let's take a look at this room.  So which one should I look at?  Open Ant 2 or Open Ant 1?  Wow.  Why did you have a bad weekend?  No, just some personal stuff.  Family issues.  All right.  Oh, wow.  That is very shiny.  Wait.  Now, you see the weird thing is the way the light will shine off certain things.  Like...  Oh, God. 
[02:39:30]  People eating in here.  That's called the raise getter.  All righty.  The raise getter.  Put it here.  For those of you that can't see, you're not on PowTalk.  I just opened the most luscious, boyish asshole you've ever seen.  Nice red eye.  Is it red?  I don't know why it's red.  Your ass is...  You know why?  Your ass is always red, dude.  Not even kidding.  It looks like somebody is constantly fucking you in the ass.  I don't know that.  You look at it.  I actually wipe so good.  I mean, my ass...  Nothing, dude.  Can't go in my ass.  My ass is as tight as a fucking... 
[02:40:00]  It looks like those Cheerios Ulp is eating.  Oh, dude.  And the actual asshole looks like a blueberry.  It's honey nut, too.  It does look like a blueberry.  It does.  He has a little blueberry asshole.  You have to say it like that.  Blueberry.  Blueberry.  Leaking a milky substance, too.  Looks like a whale crying.  Hilo, give me permission to break one of the panes of glass.  Oh, I'm not going to do that.  Come on.  That's not glass.  That's not glass.  It's plastic.  That is.  It's like paper.  Look at it.  It's wrinkled.  I would never...  Kenny, tap that.  What is it? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, it's not glass.  It's aluminum foil.  No.  It is.  It's like aluminum foil.  Mylar.  Is Kenny just poking it in the ceiling?  Yeah, yeah.  With his fucking head.  Smoothie.  Banana, strawberry.  Delicious.  Strong combination.  That is good.  Boss, congrats on the comeback.  Thank you, sir.  What a comeback.  Last week, the stock started moving in the right direction.  It will.  Yeah, we got approval for the FCC radios last week, which is good.  Nice.  Yeah.  So, all the new radios coming out for the end of the year and first part of next year. 
[02:41:00]  Excellent.  They don't transmit over like five miles.  Little mini pirate stations.  Yeah.  You could actually hear the recorders in Bush's office and stuff.  I couldn't think of anything that would sound good, so I'd just use a present up to the  line.  Fucking, what I just did.  It wasn't even hack.  It was too unfunny to be hack.  It was just dreck.  Blame it on the upside down guy above you.  Exactly.  It wasn't me.  It was my author ego.  Norton Midge, who's not funny. 
[02:41:30]  Jim Norton's a hoot.  Norton Midge is a hootless jizz bucket.  Coattail riding fat-titted cunt.  Jim Norton hoot.  Norton Midge, no good.  Well, I guess the ELO's explain the ceiling.  Yeah, the ceiling should have been installed with the lights.  There's been no...  Boring.  We went and put me...  Yes, it is boring.  And I believe the phone bank put in front of me here is for Ron Bennington's use. 
[02:42:00]  Not for Ron.  So Ron takes the call.  So Ron takes the call.  Eddie Yannier.  Hey, Bill, Yannier, Ron and Fez.  Hi, Bill.  Hey, buddy.  How you doing, buddy?  How you doing there, buddy?  Unbelievable.  I don't like the down, ELO.  I hope you feel better.  I'm sorry, guys.  That's okay.  I feel...  I don't want you to be unhappy.  I'm very happy.  You're not leaving the company, are you?  I'm happy it's your back.  You're not leaving the company, are you?  No.  Well, at least not by my own choice.  They're not going to fire you, are they?  No.  All right.  Well, you know Pinero's coming up to see you guys. 
[02:42:30]  Okay, cool.  When?  But they're not going to fire you, are they?  You know, we should ask him that question.  They're going to fire us?  All right.  He's supposed to come on the 7th, but I think he's pushing him back.  That whole thing with you sexually harassing the other man at the accident, that kind  of got blown over, right?  Well, it's certainly a rarituck we had.  The photos of your testicles in the coffee machine was just a joke.  And peanuts in the coffee pot.  Yeah.  Just being a goose.  Right.  ELO's a nutty.  He likes that.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Everything's good.  Okay, man. 
[02:43:00]  Thank you, the real ELO.  All right.  See you guys later.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye, guys.  He hangs up, but I can still see him.  Man, he's a real downer.  I know.  He's not feeling good today.  Put the whole show down.  His collar shirt.  Eric's neck looks like mine on Pal Talk.  Oh, my God.  You got to do some neck ups.  Eric has a neck like I do.  It's depressing.  He's got to do neck ups with a tie.  His tie's all open.  Eric's looking like nutty.  You didn't get that.  I thought I would get a chill.  That was pretty good.  Why don't we take a break?  Ralphie May in studio.  Bob Kelly.  We're going to eat some food. 
[02:43:30]  I got some shit coming.  Bob, did you order some new food?  I ordered a...  Stop with the apple juice.  Have an apple.  I had an egg white omelet.  It's coming.  With onions and mushrooms.  No cheese.  No cheese.  No cheese.  I forgot to tell him wheat bread.  You can have wheat bread on phase four.  Yeah, could you keep off the life, nigga?  What's up?  Take off everything that has flavor in it.  Could you do that?  Hey, dude.  You just fucking smashed me for having chips in an egg sandwich with cheese.  I'm saying how much it sucks.  Oh, sorry, Anthony.  You know, it's like...  Because egg...  Doesn't the yolk make the egg... 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, the little baby fetus.  The yolk makes the fucking egg.  Opie, you're insane.  You say that all the time.  Just like in regular life.  Let me tell you something.  The cootie pie makes the egg omelet.  I like the yolk.  It is all about the yolk.  But I prefer...  I can eat egg whites.  Once in a while.  You can.  See, it's not like you...  You'd rather have one with a yolk.  No, I wouldn't.  Toast.  You take toast...  It doesn't do anything to you.  And you jam it into the yolk.  And it's great.  It tastes good.  You're right.  And it doesn't...  You know what?  The yolk isn't that bad for you.  Oh, is it?  If you're having a heart attack or you get a high blood... 
[02:44:30]  It depends on how you...  You have high blood pressure.  But if you're trying to lose weight, you can have a frigging yolk.  Okay.  Yeah, a yolk.  When you're having a double egg sandwich every fucking morning, it's going to be a problem.  How about this?  You just train yourself to not have it.  Really?  A guy who just got his shit together in the last month and a half because you're on TV  and you saw your neck?  Dude, I can't help it.  I mean, you know what?  There's a man with...  You're looking at him guns.  When you're doing stuff, when you're hitting the gym and stuff like that...  You're not in...  Go, Jimmy!  You're not in shape.  You're A-shape.  I'm telling you. 
[02:45:00]  Bada-boop.  Bada-boop.  You know, I'm running a 10K next year.  Bada-boop.  He really is.  I'm running a 10K for the July.  I'm just losing weight.  I'm just...  I want to do it.  Ah!  You son of a bitch!  My one fucking hope and glory you shit on, you son of a bitch!  Rap bastard!  I knew it was coming.  Was that uncalled for?  Yeah, no shit.  You're running a 10K, really?  Yeah.  You want to do it?  Are you going to be throwing beads?  I'm kidding. 
[02:45:30]  When are you running?  I don't get it.  Whatever.  I'm not that funny this morning.  Leave me alone.  You are.  When are you...  You're very good.  So when are you actually going to Spain?  Thank you, Bloomberg King.  Oh, man.  Dude, 10K is how many miles?  It's like 6.4.  6.2.  6.2, something like that.  I've run many of those dumb things.  When are you doing this?  I've never run one.  I mean, you're not talking about somebody who votes experience.  Have you ever run any type of distance?  Yeah, I've run...  I'm up to like two miles at a time I can run.  You can run two miles? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  That's great.  By next July, I'll be able to do...  I should be able to do it all.  That's what they're telling me.  I'm going to...  I got a program guy who's helping me out.  Because I want to do it because I don't want to be the fat guy that fucking doesn't do anything.  So you eat better, right?  I eat a lot better.  Okay.  I eat a lot better.  It's hard, right?  You just told me to go to get chicken with potato chips fried on it.  Yeah, because I can't.  I live vicariously through you.  You can't?  You don't do it?  No, I don't do it.  I can't do it either, though.  Jesus.  You're fat.  I'm going to have to wear three button shirts for the rest of my life because I'm too fat. 
[02:46:30]  I'm going to stretch them out before I put them on so they're like a sundress.  Bob's fat is hard, too.  Bob is a hard fat.  You know what?  I'll tell you why.  I got my grandfather's fat.  It's like this Irish belly that just...  When you get fat, it's just solid as a rock.  You know what I mean?  It's just...  You can punch it.  Yeah.  And it's solid.  Can't tell if you're pregnant or starving to death.  Right.  What's up?  What's your time, Bob?  What's my time?  It's your time to shine.  You're blown up.  You're blown up.  I got a little...  I hired a trainer.  Your career's blowing up.  I got a trainer.  Bill, he's gay.  Enjoy yourself.  Is he? 
[02:47:00]  The guy who gave me a massage.  He's my trainer now.  I asked him the next time he could please wear underwear because I can feel the back of  his helmet on my neck while he's stretching me.  Oh, dude.  Oh, man.  Dude, how much for a session?  50 bucks.  Does he give a good massage?  Why did you...  Yeah, he gives me one of the best massages ever.  Why did you do that?  I told you I got mad because he didn't want anything to do with me.  I took my shirt off and he wouldn't...  He just rubbed my hamstring.  He wouldn't do anything.  It wouldn't even go into my butt.  Why would he?  You filthy, rotten ass. 
[02:47:30]  You have a gay guy with his cock on your neck.  But it's...  He's bad.  So look, so the guy who massages you...  No, at the end of the session, he'll stretch you out.  You gotta get...  You stretch out your asshole.  Yeah.  Lie down.  Listen, big dick daddy.  Lie down.  Hold these weights.  I could actually...  Let me say...  You're the one who's making it hurt.  Did he massage you on a table?  Relax.  On a table.  No, he does it on my bed.  I don't know, dude.  I'm asking you.  No, he gets me on a chaise.  The only massage I can get without being a pig is from a fucking unattractive girl. 
[02:48:00]  Like if I...  Jesus.  Uh-oh.  Really?  Oh, that's good.  I'm getting over being sick, by the way.  While you guys were off gallivanting, I had fucking pink eye in both eyes.  I helped save turtles.  That's true.  I'm ashamed.  He helped save your relatives.  Your cousin made it because it helped me.  You got sick?  Oh, dude.  It was awful. 
[02:48:30]  I had pink eye in both eyes.  I had a horribly sore throat.  I was coughing.  And yesterday, I was going to go see John Mayer and Cheryl Crowe.  What?  John Mayer sucks, dude.  No, I like John Mayer.  Oh, God.  He's my buddy.  He's a friend of mine.  I don't care.  Then I'm going to shit on him harder.  Wait.  Did you get his tampons?  Did you hear a new song?  I hate John Mayer.  Wait down the world to change.  He's a good tone.  Oh, God.  Air guitar in the studio, jackass.  Why not?  You play long neck bass. 
[02:49:00]  First of all, he plays the guitar, not the long neck bass.  Freaking little thing.  I was going to go see him with my girlfriend.  I got shushed.  I didn't shushed you.  No, by John Mayer.  Ah.  Stop.  Oh.  Something's happening.  I got a joke.  Why did he shush?  Why did he shush?  He was going on.  I was on Ryan Seacrest, on air with the Ryan Seacrest, that show, for a cup of coffee.  They found out my ratings were, I mean, my focus group numbers were better than Ryan 
[02:49:30]  Seacrest's.  And I was backstage, and they were talking to me about something, and I cracked a joke.  And John Mayer goes, shh.  And I'm like, you fucking half a fag.  I can't believe you fucking said it.  You were shushed.  By John Mayer.  I got the shush.  Did you shush?  No, I was like, fuck you.  All right?  At the time, you only had one hit.  I didn't know I was fucking committing, you know, entertainment death, you know, by fucking  with it, but, yeah.  Well, I was going to go see my friend, the multi-platinum artist.  Who does the radio show now, by the way. 
[02:50:00]  Yes, we love him.  I like him.  But I was actually going to go see him in Sean Cross.  He's doing my show.  And I had a toothache yesterday that was so bad, I had to leave the hotel at 5 in the morning.  You're a sick, pink-eyed toothache.  Dude.  It's called AIDS.  You might have a deficient immune system.  My immune system was amazing.  I got a little one up.  And you lost weight, skinny.  Dude.  I was so angry at my tooth, I was digging my finger down to my gums going, meh.  I actually, I made that noise.  It was rage.  I had to leave the hotel and go to the fucking store and get some oragell and stuff, and 
[02:50:30]  then it was fine the next day.  That works?  Dude, it's the only thing that allowed me to sleep.  And then I said to my girlfriend, like, I'm not feeling good, so I fucked her in her mouth  real hard, and then kind of spit on her.  And that's just how we work things out.  By the way, I met her phenomenally cool lady.  Yeah, she's very nice, man.  She's very nice, and she's funny.  Yes.  She's a good girl.  She takes care of me.  We have fun.  She is.  My girlfriend actually met, you know, she's met a bunch of Jimmy's gals.  She liked this one a lot. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, she was nice.  We all like her, Jimmy.  Yeah, she's very nice.  Don't blow it.  I'm so worried I'm going to blow her.  Don't fuck this one up.  I don't know how to be in love.  You're going to fuck it up.  I like her.  I don't know.  It's the only time you came over to my house and actually behaved yourself in front of  my chick.  What?  You didn't pick your nose and feed it to my dog.  I love to a lot.  Fart.  And then blame it on my girlfriend.  It's on.  He calls my girl D, too.  That's her nickname, D.  I call her D.  She calls me B.  He comes over.  Hey, what's up, D?  Hey, D.  Hey, D.  She leaves me messages.  She always goes, hey, Jay.  What?  What? 
[02:51:30]  It's been stories about you, though.  You're like, hey, I'm Jay.  This is D.  I was talking to my girlfriend.  If I walked in and she was with nine black dudes, I'd forgive that.  If I walked in and she was shitting on his chest, I'd dump her.  That's just creepy to me.  I told you the time she comes out of the bathroom, he's sitting there on the couch.  This is how much of a creep he is.  I go, Don, put your shirt on.  And he turned around to look at my girl's tits.  She had a shirt on.  I just want to see how creepy this asshole was.  He spun around like somebody got shot, like the Brady Bunch episode when Mike threw the 
[02:52:00]  briefcase.  Dude, I just wanted to see them again.  Again?  Oh, wait, wait.  My wife thinks you're the nicest guy of all time, Jimmy.  Because I'm nice to Lana.  I'm nice to Dawn.  I'm nice to people's wives and girls.  I'm always very courteous and respectful to Anne's chick, to Hope's chick.  I'm very good to the girlfriends.  If you fuck this up, though, can you tell us so we can videotape you crawling up the stairs  crying? 
[02:52:30]  Dude, here's what I know I'm going to do.  I'm going to wreck it.  On my knees.  You're going to wreck it.  Then what's going to happen?  Walk us through it before it happens.  Okay, this girl is so...  What's going to ruin it?  She's so buff.  She wants nothing material from me.  She doesn't ask.  She's really low maintenance.  I want to go eat the palms.  She's like, ah, come on.  We're in a Leonard Skinner shirt.  Let's go eat somewhere cheap.  She just wants to hang.  She's the coolest chick.  We kiss.  It's very loving.  I know I'm going to ruin it because I don't know how to handle it.  I know how to handle unhappiness and creepiness, so I'm going to blow it. 
[02:53:00]  I'm not going to fuck a lot of girls or that stuff.  I'm going to wind up.  I'll be honest with her.  I'm not going to fuck a lot of girls.  A lot of girls.  Is this part of blowing it, dummy?  I didn't mean it like that.  I'm not going to cheat.  Sorry about that.  Hope she doesn't have an XM.  No, no, no.  But I would say this to her because I've told her.  I'm a dysfunctional fucking human being.  I always have been.  But this is making it come full circle.  I don't know how to be complete with one person.  I don't know how to do it.  Why don't you go to therapy?  I'll give you my therapist's number.  Get your crap together.  Because I don't want my therapist being the same one as yours because, first of all, 
[02:53:30]  I don't care if she's old and ugly.  I just don't want to talk to a guy like that.  There's a guy.  His wife does it.  Right next door.  Are you serious?  Right there.  Is she helping you?  Like, can I have that number by the way?  She's making me recognize what a maniac I am.  Yeah.  By not doing anything.  She's just being nice.  Like, she's being herself.  She doesn't want shit from me.  You know what I mean?  It's like, dude, this is what you want this from a person.  I mean, I've dated a lot of great girls, to be honest. 
[02:54:00]  I'm the problem in relationships.  It's not that I haven't dated a bunch of cunts.  They're nice chicks.  I'm a fuck up.  And with this one, it's just like, I'm 38 now.  Like, what are you going to do?  Are you going to blow it with your three-year-old girl?  You asshole.  Yeah, stop fucking it up.  So if there's anyone listening that I've dated, A, I owe you money.  I apologize.  You'll get it.  C, I didn't give you that.  I said, I said, I actually, hepatitis A.  I said, I gave you a hep C and B, H, I, and B.  I said, A, and then I went to C.  I forgot my B. 
[02:54:30]  See, that's what it is.  The A, Bs, and Cs of diseases you got from Jimmy.  I just know I'm fucking finished.  I know I'm going to fuck it up.  No.  Oh.  Oh, what happened?  He's trying to squeeze one of the other shit himself.  Did you start?  I don't think so.  He's trying to make room for breakfast.  You're going to gross me out?  He's throwing his fart.  If you fart in my mouth, I'll laugh at it.  Are you kidding me?  You'll jerk off to it.  Please.  What a child's play that fart was.  What a child's play. 
[02:55:00]  Was that bad?  That's a bad one, please.  What happens?  Edge with a little hubba-bubba.  What happens after you blow it?  Can I say something?  I'm sorry, man.  You had edge yesterday, too, didn't you, Bobby?  That's a good one, right?  I will be really probably very depressed.  I'll blow it.  I'll tell myself this was the right thing to do for her sake.  And then a week later, I'll be fucking horribly depressed.  Because I'll realize, you dumb motherfucker.  And I'm honest with her.  Like, I'm really honest with her. 
[02:55:30]  And other chicks, I don't like to lie to girls.  I'm not a good liar.  Oh, boy.  And by the way, anyone who says that is a fantastic liar.  Exactly.  I'm lying to you, bitch.  Have you ever blown a she-mail?  No.  Exactly.  Fantastic liar.  But then again, you really set me up in a bad spot there.  You tried to give a blow a she-mail.  You didn't ask the question.  What's the question?  I don't know the term.  You know this weird terminology about sucking a guy's cock.  It's like, no.  Uncut.  Well, it's not.  What?  That's not what you do with she-mails. 
[02:56:00]  What?  Topper?  Well, you know.  Exactly.  What?  Nothing.  Just think about what she said.  Someone tops, they don't blow.  If you're getting your dick sucked, you don't do it.  You just get it and go ahead and beat it, you goose.  Hey, you rubber balls.  Beat it, you goose.  Get out of here.  We tussle your hair.  But I'm afraid your wig will fall off and reveal what I already kind of beat down now.  Can I get that zit on your back, honey?  I noticed it while you were blowing me.  So listen, I know.  Actually, I'm not convinced I'm going to fuck her because I've been really honest with her.  Yeah.  You're not going to fuck this up. 
[02:56:30]  It's hard for me to have sex with somebody who I'm that into.  It's so hard for me to combine those things, man.  That is bizarre.  Dude, and I talked to Ann about this.  I mean, we chatted a bit and he was happy for you.  Having sex with me.  It's hard to fuck somebody you love?  You know how hard it is to fuck you, Ann?  It's so hard to fuck you because I care about you.  I can fuck a girl I like.  I can fuck a girl I like.  Like, I can like you a lot as a person and fuck you.  But if there's a commitment there or any kind of like, I'm like, I fucking panic. 
[02:57:00]  It's because of the, it's because, I'll tell you why.  That is so fucking bizarre.  No, probably not though.  Not enough dirtiness going on?  Because it's, it's, it's, it's, it's real.  It's intimate.  And you have to degrade, it has, you have to degrade yourself like you do in daily life.  Right.  You have to make it bad.  It has to be because you don't deserve it.  You're a piece of shit.  Is there because there's no.  That's what you have to do.  Is there because there's no guilt involved?  Yes.  It's just not bad.  It has to be bad.  If it's not bad, it doesn't get you dick hard.  Because he got, you know, he had to blow a guy in a closet when he was, I'm not saying 
[02:57:30]  that to bust your balls that you did that.  It was under, I know it was under a porch.  Yeah.  Okay.  Good.  Get your story straight.  That's a different one.  I was the closet.  I know you are.  You were just changing the situation to protect the innocent.  Yeah.  I know what you were doing.  I was CSIing it.  Right.  But you know, you need it dirty.  And then when you get with somebody you like, it's all of a sudden, it's like the only people  that I've ever loved as far as women is my sister and my mom.  So it's like, I care about you. 
[02:58:00]  Well, can't you bring some of that dirtiness into an unhealthy relationship?  You're looking at, you get a stare at her vagina and go, it's not my sister.  It's not my sister.  It's not my sister.  It's not my sister.  Holy shit.  Whoa.  Wow.  Are you fucked up?  I'm not saying me.  I'm saying Norton.  Dysfunction junction.  No.  Anthony, you're not making it about me.  I'm helping Jim.  No, here's what it is.  I hear you.  Bobby raised a good point.  And for me, it's not the sister thing, but it does come down to, like when I have like  a girl like this, because the way we met was non-sexually. 
[02:58:30]  We met, we were kind of friends first, and there was no hint of dating.  That's why it's hard.  Like a lot of girls I've dated, I'm sexual with quickly.  So it's okay.  Once I, it's okay.  We got that out of the way.  Like, um, but once, if I'm friends with you and I care for you, it's hard for me to sexualize.  You're talking about a normal relationship.  You're talking about a normal relationship.  You're talking about getting to know somebody first.  It's so much better, dude.  And then moving it into a sexual thing. 
[02:59:00]  We don't do that.  We don't do that as addicts.  We don't do that, man.  We meet a chick that has low, we want to have low self-esteem.  We want her to be low.  Because once her opinion of us is the same as our opinion of us, we're fucked.  It's over.  Once she realizes how much of a scumbag I am, and that I have no self-esteem, I'm a spineless  asshole, and everything I have is fake, and that's why we do stand-up, and we get chicks  from the, hey, ooh, you're so funny.  And then they realize that I'm just a fucking regular shithead that likes to eat on the couch  and pick his ass.  Ah, shit, I'm finished. 
[02:59:30]  You know what I mean?  So get that banging over quickly.  But how do you turn that around?  You know what you do?  You really, honestly, have to, this is weird, but you gotta fucking hang with, what?  Cut the porn.  I don't, you can't watch the porn.  You can't fucking be negative.  You can't be self-destructive.  I can't go to massage parlors.  I used to go like three times a week.  Anytime I went on the road, I'd go to the hotel, get the phone book, go take a shit, find out  where I'm going.  I look for body shampoo.  I know that's a place to jerk you off.  I look for open past 10 at night. 
[03:00:00]  I know they jerk.  I know everything.  Did you ever think maybe you guys are addicted to addiction?  No.  Yeah.  Like, like, some of you guys, everything has to be this fucking addiction.  The double mean release.  This, this thing like, all right, I can't drink, so you stop drinking.  Uh, you know, you don't want to smoke, that's fine.  You don't smoke.  No drugs, because drugs fucked you up.  This.  And then it's gotta, like, everything's gotta turn into this big fucking thing where, because 
[03:00:30]  I need this, now I gotta completely cut porno out of my fucking life.  Well, in a way, it is, it's only the things that, that merit that type of, of an attitude.  Like, when I look at my history, I've been a sex addict long before I ever drank.  I was in second grade.  I mean, you know the monster range stories.  I was addicted to the high of the inappropriateness.  Like, so, I mean, I've been a fucked up guy like that my whole life, man.  I'm 38.  Where does that come from?  I don't know.  It seems like it would be abuse, but again, it might not have been abuse.  It might have been just other kids in the neighborhood, me jumping in with that. 
[03:01:00]  Honestly, that's why I ask, because that's the easy answer, to say, well, I was touched  as a kid, and that's how it started all.  I don't know if that's that.  His fucking brain.  I don't know if that's always the answer.  No, that's why I ask you.  I agree.  No, it's because, once you start, you know, once you learn how to not feel.  Right.  Not feel.  I don't feel.  I don't cry.  I cry at friggin' midgets.  You know what I mean?  Because I don't cry at my own shitty life.  I can't cry, you know.  So you watch a movie, and you're a blubbering idiot.  I watch a minute, and it triggers some shit off where I'm like, oh. 
[03:01:30]  You know what I mean?  It's so fucked up.  You cannot.  You got the world by the...  This is your time right now, man.  Yeah, man.  Right?  It's your time to shine.  You were the star of tourgasm.  You're starting to sell out.  Right.  Then you gotta...  Are you gonna enjoy it?  Absolutely.  I'm trying.  Absolutely not.  I literally have to talk.  But you gotta, you know, call him up or call...  You can call him up and be like, dude, I got tackled by depression today.  You're each other's fucking sponsors.  Yeah.  We gotta help each other. 
[03:02:00]  Sometimes the thing that makes you good at what you do is also a curse, as cliche as that  is.  I mean, we all have that as people.  Like, the things that make us able to do whatever, it's also the thing you gotta watch  out for, because it'll fucking slice your throat.  Yeah, we're all going on stage talking about what fucking douchebags we are.  And there's people in the crowd going, I am too.  And that's why they think we're funny, because they can relate to us.  So, yeah, I've known you for over six years.  I can't...  I am rooting for you so...  It's not even funny I'm rooting for you so much.  On this one, yeah.  She is unbelievable, and I see how you guys together see how you act. 
[03:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  So, are you gonna...  What are you gonna do?  I don't...  You gotta try to...  You gotta try to make this work.  I will.  And I've been talking to her the whole time.  I've been really honest with her.  I mean, nothing bizarre, but she's really a cool chick.  I think she likes...  She's like, I like the fact that you communicate.  She's like, because most men don't talk about anything.  So, like, she's not turned off by me going, look, I'm a fucking loon.  And she likes the fact that I'm being honest with her, because a lot of guys are like this  and won't talk about it.  So, I mean, I really...  I have fun with her.  But again, once I see you...  You know, it's a lot of childhood shit.  Like, I have, like... 
[03:03:00]  When I fall in love, or when I start to, or whatever it is, I start to look at you like  I looked at girls when I was a kid.  Like, that puppy love, that innocent shit.  So, I don't know how to take it from there into what...  That's the problem.  When I start to see you like that, then I really have something special for you.  But it's like, I can't translate into the other, the sexual.  You know, after we saw you at the cellar, my wife goes, I...  You know, that's so good for Jim that he's got this great girl.  She seems like a really nice lady.  And she goes, I hope he doesn't fuck it up. 
[03:03:30]  And then she goes, I wonder who pees on who.  Oh, she's too nice for that, dude.  She won't let me...  She wouldn't...  I wouldn't even mention Tinkle to her.  And that would fuck it up for you, right?  Well, no, I don't really...  I haven't peed in over a year.  What if you found somebody that you liked and was like, yeah, hit me with it, baby.  Let's rock.  But you're not getting peed on because you like it.  You're getting peed on to fucking...  To make it degrading.  No, speak for yourself.  All right, you're right.  It does taste like popcorn.  Who am I kidding?  Time can be enjoyable.  Yeah, you're right.  Can't you just look at it like, you know, you're going out and enjoying someone's company 
[03:04:00]  and you happen to be closer than just friends and there's a sexual thing there, but you enjoy  talking to each other, hanging out, shit like that.  Why does it have to get so deep that you're thinking, well, all of a sudden I feel like  it did when I was a little kid.  Yeah, stop overthinking it.  Yeah, very good.  I'm only overthinking it now because I'm looking at like, why do I do stuff like that?  I don't think of it in that moment, but I'm just like, when someone says to me, why you 
[03:04:30]  like this, well, that's why.  It just happens.  It's like, yeah, we are just friends and this and that, but whenever I start to look at a  girl like that and hang out, I'm a fucking pervert, dude.  I don't look at girls like, hey, we're a little more than friends when you hang out.  I don't waste my time.  I don't do it.  You know what I mean?  I don't hang with chicks like that.  I'm a fucking creep.  Yeah, okay.  He's not, okay.  He's not a creep.  I don't hurt women.  You're not a creep.  No, no, I can see what you mean, though.  I played chess with my wife like three times and you didn't do anything inappropriate 
[03:05:00]  at all.  No, but she's your wife, though, dude.  I know, but you're fucking, but dude, you, eight years ago, I came to realize that you  just-  Did he play with what he calls the spitting bishop?  No, I mean, but-  You just can't fuck them all.  And when you can't, I mean, because you get, I mean, Bobby's gotten some stardom, you got  stardom, and you're going to have pussy throwing at you left and right.  And pretty much, it's all the same, okay?  I mean, a little freak here, a little freak there, some's meatier, some's nice, some smells  better.  Yeah, right?  But I mean, basically, it's a pussy pussy, okay? 
[03:05:30]  No, no, there's a lot of different pussy.  Yeah, some-  I have any-  Would you go best to me?  I've got a cock and balls on it.  You just simply can't fuck them all.  It makes life so much simpler, okay?  It's like, who can I hang out with now?  All right?  And then you figure the rest out.  It's so much easier being married.  Well, you know what?  Dude, listen.  The fact is, is that we have a hard-  I'm sorry.  Yeah, as you talk about addiction, as you-  Yeah, keep feeding that emptiness.  It's a wheat bread.  It's not enough. 
[03:06:00]  It's wheat toast.  It really wasn't.  It's a wheat toast, you.  I love addiction.  I want to tell people about addiction.  I was so-  That's the worst.  I want to tell people, let me tell you something.  I don't smoke, I don't drink, I eat properly.  You make it so easy sometimes.  I was in such a weird place last night, or two nights ago, Saturday night, because my  tooth hurt, that she insisted on coming to the pharmacy with me.  I'm thinking, ah, she thinks I'm going to go out and fuck another girl, but she didn't  think that.  Oh.  She's like, I'll go with you. 
[03:06:30]  She just wanted to go with you.  I'll go with you.  It's cool, I'll go with you.  And I'm like, what do you think I was going to do?  And she said, I don't know.  You were just in a weird-  I thought you were going to do something stupid.  You were in a weird place.  But no, she didn't think I was going to cheat.  It wasn't about that.  It was-  Dude, this girl you are with right now, I'm telling you, is going to change the  way you are.  Yeah, it's going to be-  Honest to God, dude.  You're going to change the way you are.  And sometimes it takes that one girl.  Like every, you know, there's always that one chick that makes you- it might take a while,  but you'll stop doing the shenanigans you're doing because of her. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, she's a really-  And if not, you'll get AIDS.  One or the other.  One or the other.  She's a really nice girl.  She's willing to bang whenever- it's not like she's not cold.  You know, believe me, she likes sex.  There's nothing weird about that.  It's just hard for me to translate that.  It always has been.  And that's why girls who I've had good sex with-  Do you get a ride?  I can at times.  Other times, it's not that I don't want to fuck her.  It's just I feel weird looking at her that way.  And you just explain this to her?  Yes.  And she's cool with it?  She understands because she knows I'm talking to the truth.  I'm not being a dick about it.  I'm not-  Does she get frustrated? 
[03:07:30]  I don't think so.  I mean, again, I don't know.  Yes.  But we've had good sex.  I mean, the sex we've had has been very good.  But what was different?  Um, I think it was because there was a lot of kissing before.  I just don't know.  I mean, there's times where, like, I guess I'm really horny.  And, like, as opposed-  It's hard for me to get hornier with somebody.  Like, I kind of have to be horny when we start.  And then it's okay to look at them that way.  But it's hard for me to get to that place.  But it's nothing to do with her.  That is interesting.  But girls that I've had sex with wonder why won't he take it here with me. 
[03:08:00]  That's why.  Because if I look at you that way, it's not that I don't like you.  But I'm going to shut down if I look at you.  I mean, I literally shut down.  Jesus Christ.  I shut down totally.  Like, I get-  I turn into, like, a little kid.  I can't-  There was a time where it was like, I can't even, you know, I would just-  I just want to, like, lie in bed.  I'd eat, watch movies, fall asleep, and that's about it.  And I'd have to go out and fucking be deviant.  I'd have to do sex with somebody who I can fucking spit on, slap her ass, 
[03:08:30]  tell her she's a dumb chink.  You know what I mean?  I mean, it just had to be bad.  She's Irish.  That's the beauty of that.  You know what I mean?  I couldn't-  I had to ease up on my part, and she had to actually get a little dirtier on her part.  It couldn't be always this-  You know, the girls always want this, you know, kiss, and then we, you know,  grab, you know, this sensual thing, and then go down to her breast.  Like, that B-movie sex scene.  They always want that horse shit.  And it's like, I can't do that either.  There's got to be some dirty-  There's got to be some dirt here, too.  You've got to come my way a little. 
[03:09:00]  I'll go your way a little bit, too.  But it's like, she always wanted it to be nice and romantic with candles, and ugh.  And I'd come home, and I'd be like, this doesn't get my dick hard, honey.  Panties don't get my dick hard.  Dress up like, you know, a schoolgirl.  That might get my-  But are you putting on a negligee?  I know it's a fancy bra.  I know the panties are sexy.  It does nothing for me.  It's pink.  I don't give a fuck if I can see your pussy through your underwear.  Yeah, sometimes that's good horse shit.  I think most guys out there could relate to that.  All of us want a little dirt in our relationship. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, but-  If it was all just that, you know, over-the-top romantic crap, you know, you need to get down  and dirty sometimes.  Yeah, absolutely.  And if you find someone that, you know, understands that, and, you know, there's nothing wrong with it.  By the way, I think that this girl would be happy to explore with me.  I mean, I really do.  She's, like, really open.  She's cool.  But I'm the problem.  Which one are you going to start with?  Well, the way I-  Oh, boy.  I'm not going to take her to Jurassic Park town.  I mean, a little exploration. 
[03:10:00]  You're going to start on Sesame Street.  Yeah, exactly.  We'll take a little look in this door.  No need to go into the basement.  Before you go to Hershey Park.  Why is there a box in your basement?  I know you're already thinking about, like, all right, what can I maybe start with here  with her that she's going to understand and go with?  I know.  How will I feel about doing that?  Like, because I like her.  Tying her up and going to the store.  That's what you're going to do?  Yeah.  Jerk off in her shoes.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Now, let me ask you a question.  Now, you're-  Because you're really into that stuff. 
[03:10:30]  That's not like-  I'm not-  You're saying that you like some dirty stuff, and it's not because you're filling a hole.  See, I did bad shit, like hookers and stuff like that, and I didn't want to do it.  I did it because I had to-  I was trying to fill something.  Right.  And then I was like, I don't-  When, you know, I kind of, you know, got bagged a little bit.  I stopped doing that stuff because of me, not for her.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  But you like that stuff.  You like doing this little dominant, freaky stuff.  Well, yeah, a little bit of domination, a little hair pulling. 
[03:11:00]  But what girl doesn't want her hair pulled?  I mean, believe me, I grabbed her hair a little bit in bed, and she enjoyed it.  All right, let's-  A little hair pull.  Yeah, give her a good-  The phones.  Deep one.  Unbelievable.  Mike in California.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that in addition to being probably the funniest program on the radio,  I really appreciate how honest you guys are.  Jimmy's out there pouring his heart out.  I absolutely love today's show.  Jimmy, buddy, hey, I've been there.  I've been married to my wife six years.  I love the dirty stuff, and there's nothing better than after having a real night of dirty, 
[03:11:30]  raunchy sex, and the next morning we get up, she takes my baby to daycare, and I go  off, and I teach a bunch of kids at high school.  I think there's a lot of ladies out there that think the dirty thing is just, you know-  Part of it.  Not part of it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, absolutely.  What do you mean?  Wow.  They really think that that's like, oh, no, I don't do that stuff.  I think they want-  Yeah.  They want-  They forget all that shit they used to do.  You know?  All that horrid stuff they used to do, fuck it in the back of an escort.  They want what Bobby was talking about, just to romance all the time. 
[03:12:00]  They want the majority of women out there.  If I'm wrong, then ladies call up.  You understand, though, they're taught on television in these dumb movies, that's what  that's what I want.  That's nice.  This is so pretty.  And you come home, she's got candles lit, and you're exhausted.  You just did three shows.  You have- your balls are all sweaty.  You might want to come in and maybe, you know, just blow the candles out, get on the bed.  I told my girl, I go, look, sometimes, if you want to have sex, I'm just going to please you.  That's it. 
[03:12:30]  Get yourself this, get a little vibrator, and I'll do my job for you.  My job.  Sometimes it will be fucking- it will be romantic and intimate.  Sometimes.  Most of the times, it's just going to be me fucking with my eyes shut.  You know what I mean?  And that's all right, too, though.  That's not bad.  Yeah, this way you can't see her eyes shut.  Oh, don't think we're not fucking each other.  We're blind.  Helen Keller, are you done?  Yeah, don't throw up on my stomach again.  Keep your eyes shut, whore.  Hey, we got a psychotherapist online here. 
[03:13:00]  Garrett, Massachusetts.  What's up?  Jim?  Well, hold on.  We can go Gavin to get our headphones.  Okay, bye.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Yes.  Fear of intimacy.  Three words, buddy.  Fear of intimacy.  That's what's going on here.  You got the addiction history happening, okay?  Part of addiction and recovery, when you get clean,  part of it is self-medicating all this stuff away,  all this stuff you don't want to feel.  It could be the Monster Rain stuff. 
[03:13:30]  Right.  It could be whatever stuff that was going on historically.  But the bottom line is,  when you have to get real with someone else,  it is really uncomfortable.  And that's what's going on here, Jim.  I know.  You can sit here and self-medicate this all the way with strippers and hookers  and whatever other stuff you're doing.  I don't care how long you got clean.  What it comes down to is, number one, you're powerless over this stuff.  Yeah.  Number two, you got something else operating your life?  Huh?  Yeah.  You know two and three, right?  Right, right. 
[03:14:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah, of course.  And then there's four and five.  You know, you got to look at your side of the street.  I know you and I are talking in code,  and nobody knows what the hell we're talking about.  No, dude, I know exactly what he made me.  I know what you're talking about, too.  I actually said exactly what you said.  I said fear intimacy.  It is.  Jim?  Thanks.  Yes.  Get a sponsor.  Go to some meetings.  Be nice to this girl,  because you know if you blow this one,  you're going to spend the rest of your life alone.  That's good.  I'm just calling it as I see it, Jim.  That's good.  You know, he might not make a mistake.  He's right, though.  He's right.  I know he's right. 
[03:14:30]  Listen, don't put that much pressure on you.  You do need to go to me.  You need to take your keys up.  Maybe not about the best of the life, but, you know, Jesus.  But what you're saying about do this and do that is correct.  The things you said to do are correct.  You're absolutely right.  You have to do that.  It is fear of intimacy.  It's fear of actually making an honest connection with another human being,  especially a woman.  Very good, Jim.  Jim, you're a good guy.  Now go fuck your dog.  Thanks, man.  And rape a few of those high school students.  Put peanut butter on your balls.  He was right, dude.  Yeah, you know the therapists are the freakiest ones out there. 
[03:15:00]  And I'm not afraid of being close to men.  Like, a buddy of mine is fine,  because there's only that friendship.  I can be close to a guy.  I can hear that.  It's all good with me, but with that,  I don't have that fear of intimacy with men,  because I'm okay being close to a guy,  because, you know, who gives a fuck?  There's no pressure there.  With a chick, you have all sexual things.  It's creepy.  Let's go to Tino in Illinois.  Tino.  Hey, shit, dicks.  How you doing this morning?  Atta boy, Tino.  Now check this out, Jimmy.  This is a true story, man.  I've been dating this girl a couple times here over the last few weeks, man.  And last night we got together.  We were trying to break the ice and get to the next step. 
[03:15:30]  We smoked a couple of joints, man.  We watched the first six episodes of Lucky Louie, man.  She loved it.  It closed the deal.  I got a pop in that ass last night, and it turned out great, man.  It's all about fear of intimacy.  You got to open up to it, man.  Thank you.  I guess, well, if Lucky Louie helped you get ass sex,  God bless me and God bless you.  Look at the power.  And that's why we need a second season of Lucky Louie.  We certainly do.  There's not enough man getting ass sex.  Fuck those asses for Lou. 
[03:16:00]  All right, let's go to Lisa.  Lisa, go ahead.  A girl.  Hi.  I heard you guys a few minutes ago talking about how all girls are interested in candles and  all that stuff.  Well, I just threw that out there because I'm convinced that's sort of true.  But what do you think?  Well, you said to call if you disagree, so that's why I'm calling.  I just, I know with my boyfriend, we never do that, and I always have a really good time.  So we like the naughty stuff.  How long have you been with him?  I've let him tie me up.  I don't know how long have you been with him.  He's tied me up.  Hey, psycho.  How long have you been with him?  You freaking freak psychopath. 
[03:16:30]  No, no, no.  I let him stick things in my ass.  What's your name?  What's your name?  I let him fuck my mouth.  What's your name?  His son watches.  Hey, Stockholm Syndrome.  I just want to know how long you've been with him.  How old are you?  His grandmother fucked me in the ass with a hairbrush.  Settle down.  We get it.  How long have you been with him?  I've been 29, and we've been together for six years now.  Six years?  What's the craziest thing he did to you?  What's the craziest thing?  Well, what's the craziest thing he did involving your cunt and a plugged-in object? 
[03:17:00]  I mean, I'm trying to ask nicely.  Well, he did have this one object.  It was not plugged in, but it was some sort of vibrating thing.  It was not actually a vibrator.  A halogen lamp?  We use that.  That's the funkiest thing I've ever wanted to do.  You guys are laughing at me.  No, we're not.  I'm laughing at Bob.  Bob's hilarious.  He's such an ass.  A halogen lamp.  I got it from my key.  I stuck it in my...  Thank God he's so fucked up, because he's a funny guy.  Was it the magic wand?  The wand. 
[03:17:30]  I don't know what it was called.  I just remember how it felt.  Yeah.  How'd it feel?  He ever do you in the ass?  Not yet.  No.  No.  Oh, wow.  But I'm open to it.  Watch Lucky Louie.  Get it?  Open to it.  Ah!  Watch Lucky Louie, baby.  This Sunday, they're showing the last four episodes in a marathon.  This Sunday.  So watch that.  It leads to ass sex.  Yeah.  Slay your asshole against his torso.  Okay.  What color hair do you have? 
[03:18:00]  Blonde.  On your ass.  Do you have a small puss or big, meaty lips?  I don't know.  You'd have to ask my boyfriend about that.  How about you show me?  How about you show me on Paltalk?  Do you have a clit like a light switch?  What's that supposed to mean if I do?  Not big, just with dirty fingerprints all over it.  And little kids' sticky jam fingers.  Does your vagina look like a fucking chimpanzee's asshole?  You guys are making fun of me.  No, we're not.  Gabby, I love you.  We love you.  Absolutely not. 
[03:18:30]  Gabby, I love you.  I do.  I listen to you all the time.  Good work.  And this is the thanks I get.  No, no, no.  We love you.  You want some thanks?  Come into the studio, and I'll give you a throat full of thanks.  Yeah.  And a fucking...  I'll grab your hair.  I'll fucking hold your hair, and I'll give you a throat, a good deep fuck, and then I'll  go, thanks, buddy, and I'll kick you out the door.  What are you thinking of them apples?  I don't know.  I was talking to fan.  It's not all about you.  What did Gavin say?  Yeah.  What wouldn't you do? 
[03:19:00]  He said, what name of things you wouldn't do?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you want...  Okay.  The only thing I...  Anything involving the bathroom, and anything involving an animal, I'm against that.  Animal or the bathroom.  So no shit, no kids, and no fucking animals.  See, you're a party pooper.  That's half my video collection.  So you wouldn't clean the tiles with Tile-X while I fuck you in the ass?  Exactly.  While your daughter tap dances and laughs?  Yeah.  But, you know, as far as anything else goes, I'm pretty open to it. 
[03:19:30]  Pretty open.  What else is there?  If you're not fucking a baby eating shit or sucking a dog's dick, you're just holding  hands as far as I'm concerned.  You just must be having pretty limited...  Shut up and let us laugh.  We're trying to bring the funny back into the program.  Oh, that was a gem.  By the way, I got into a lot of trouble allowing...  I told you about a prank about a lot of radio stations do.  They had a guy on there eat peanut butter out of my dog's ass.  And I got into a lot of trouble. 
[03:20:00]  Hilarious.  What kind of dog is it?  English Bulldog.  She can't lick her own ass because she's so fat.  She's so fucking fat.  So the vet told us to put peanut butter on her ass and make her want to lick it off.  And so she did, and my other dog helps her out.  And this guy goes, I'll do it for $5.50.  And we were like, done!  Fuck yeah!  That's awesome!  What did you...  Oh, man.  That is fucking heinous.  What radio show?  What?  Somebody you paid $5.50?  No, I didn't pay it.  The DJ guy did. 
[03:20:30]  John Holmberg.  I have a bit idea.  Yeah.  What?  What will someone lick out of a dog's asshole?  Oh, we were hoping out of your ass.  Not in my ass.  I've seen it enough.  Nice and red.  Put a pretzel nugget in there.  Yeah.  His ass looks milk dud.  A doll eye without the eye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The sheriff in Phoenix was, like, threatening to arrest us and stuff like that.  It's crazy.  It's just bestiality, I guess. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Jody in New York.  Jody.  Stupid.  Yes?  Hi, Jody.  Hi.  I'm going to half agree with Oak.  All right.  All right, baby.  Agree.  Half agree.  Half agree.  I think that we like a little romance, but we also like to get dirty once in a while.  Ooh, saucy.  What do you like?  I think a healthy relationship involves both of those things.  That's half agreeing with everybody.  Yeah.  I totally agree.  I've been with my husband 11 years, and you know what?  If we all get dirty once in a while, he's going to go somewhere else to get it, and vice  versa.  What do you consider getting dirty, toots? 
[03:21:30]  Um, let's see.  Tying up, or, you know, I just recently let him do me in the ass.  Wow.  Did you say it?  That sexy?  In the ass?  You stutter.  You stuttering prick.  Yeah, what are you fucking stuttering?  You fucking fucking right in the ass, spider.  He once brought a Negro friend home.  Hey, be nice.  I'm calling out.  What?  Huh?  Hello?  No, I just said be nice to me.  Oh, we're being nice. 
[03:22:00]  Don't abuse me.  Actually, we're not.  We didn't call you a cut yet.  Cable is being nice.  How come all the women they call want to, do they listen to the show?  They want us to be nice, but we're all just goofing on each other and laughing.  But they're like, you're being mean to me.  We're kidding around.  No.  How many years?  Your husband's mean.  He's fucking in the ass.  Yeah, exactly.  That's sick.  Fuck.  Got a big, retarded, huge mule cock.  Pushes it in.  That's being nice to me.  You a size queen, are you, baby?  Yeah.  No, seriously.  Can I ask you a question? 
[03:22:30]  Does your husband have a big penis?  Yeah.  Good size.  Is it two fists?  He's got six.  Is it two fists?  Can we play that hand game where you put your hair on top of mine and then we go all  the way up the pole until the thumb's just rubbing the top of his helmet?  Yeah.  Two hands.  Two hands?  Was it your first time up the ass?  It was the first time, yes.  Yeah?  You like it?  I did.  I think we need to do it a little more, but yeah, it wasn't bad.  So how do you think your dad would feel that you could see it? 
[03:23:00]  Oh, he might be kind of proud.  You know that.  Wow.  You know that your dead relatives see everything you're doing, right?  Yeah, well.  You know your grandfather just shook his head in a kiss fashion and then jerked off all  over your grandmother's rotten legs.  Your grandfather just shot himself again.  Yeah, terrific.  Wow.  I always think of my, I hope my grandparents can't see what I'm doing. 
[03:23:30]  This is so creepy.  Oh, isn't it creepy when you think of dead relatives just looking down on you?  I never thought of it until just now.  Just having sex.  Oh, yeah, they're watching.  Oh, man.  And they're talking and all of a sudden they just stop.  Wait a minute.  Oh, look, he's at it.  Oh, he's rolling her over.  You know what it's like when a pregnant prostitute sparks up a crack pipe in your dead grandmother's  living room?  When your grandmother used to live with you and she died and had the heart attack while  you were home and you put nitroglycerin in your trunk and then eventually you're bringing 
[03:24:00]  prostitutes into that room.  Do you know what that does?  Wait, is this true?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  That happened.  Yeah.  Pregnant prostitute sparking up a crack pipe in my grandmother's whole living room, which  was the basement of my parents' house.  Oh, yeah.  I fucked her.  Oh, that a boy.  Oh, my God.  Did you think, like, that maybe her spirit was there and looking at it?  Oh, my God.  Her books were still there.  Her books were still there in the bookshelf.  She possessed the fucking crack whore.  Oh.  Jimmy.  Jimmy. 
[03:24:30]  Why are you fucking my asshole?  I'm a banana.  I wonder why that crack whore said thanks for rubbing my temples.  What do you want for Christmas?  She shit on his chest.  You should have exorcised that fetus out of her.  Oh.  He'll boot.  Let's go.  It's D.  D in Nashville.  Hey, check this out, Grandma.  Hey, D.  Hello.  What's up?  I'm going to give you a little baby to take care of.  Look, I think that these women who are talking about they want romance are delusional. 
[03:25:00]  Yep.  That shit is not real.  You have to do freaky, nasty, kinky shit to keep things exciting.  Yeah.  I'm married.  I'm married now.  And before we got married, we used to do things like that.  And now he's flipped on me, and he wants to be romantic and cuddle and kiss and shit.  And I don't want that.  What do you want?  That a girl.  I want him to fuck me.  I don't want, you know.  Did you date Patrice?  No.  Patrice couldn't handle me. 
[03:25:30]  Ooh.  What do you look like?  Wait, I want to hear what else you want to do.  I think she's not a Brazilian.  What else do you want him to do to you?  I mean, pretty much anything.  A lot of times, I want to be degraded.  I want to be hurt and, you know, fucked well.  I don't want to be loved.  Really?  That's good.  Doesn't that just happen after you fill out a job application?  Degraded and then fucked.  Wait, how do you like to be hurt?  How do you like to be hurt?  Good job at Phone Hut.  I mean, I like to be fucked.  I like to be, I like rough sex. 
[03:26:00]  You like to be slapped?  I like to slap to bite.  I like to be slapped on the ass.  Are you a big girl?  No, no, no.  Are you roomy in the hips?  Roomy?  Yes, I am.  Yeah, yeah.  You watch Flavor of Love?  I know.  You think Flavor of Flav's going to pick you?  No, I don't.  Yeah.  You like to be hurt?  You ever have your pussy slapped?  I like to be spanked.  Yeah, oh my God, yeah.  Your pussy slapped?  What is that?  Yeah, please.  Yeah.  Look at you.  Please.  Do it to your girl.  She'll like it.  You slap the pussy like a face? 
[03:26:30]  Like a disrespectful Iraqi?  Hey, don't you talk...  I'm here to help.  You don't backhand it.  Yeah, you don't try to give it a black eye.  Oh, I don't punch you with rage because I was molested?  No!  No, you again!  He leads a little with the left before he comes in with a right hook.  I give her a UFC fight.  I choke out her pussy with a triangle.  A pussy.  He punches it and it sounds like a rubber shoe in mud.  What was the big announcement, by the way? 
[03:27:00]  What's up, buddy?  That's all you talked about at the PNC Arts Center show.  D, don't go away.  D, don't go away.  Oh, you know what it was, dude?  It was just they're showing on TV instead of pay-per-view.  Shamrock and Ortiz are fighting on Spike.  Big fight.  It's going to be on TV.  You don't have to buy it.  Oh.  Which is cool.  I thought it was going to be something better than that.  I don't know.  It's coming this month.  It's all it's talked about backstage at PNC that they were going to have a huge announcement.  And you thought it was going to be Joe Rogan fighting Wesley Snipes.  I thought it was going to be something like that.  That was supposed to happen, but Snipes backed out. 
[03:27:30]  No, he backed out because he thought once Rogan said, fuck yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I mean?  When you want to fight somebody, dude, I'll kill you.  I'll fight you right now.  And he goes, okay.  Rogan will kill him.  Rogan will kill him.  Snipes is like movie strong.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  But Rogan's fucking like a mental patient.  Yeah, he's crazy.  And he knows like.  He's retard strong, dude.  Yeah.  He's retard strong.  I smack Rogan in the face and I laugh when he runs away. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You really?  You smack him in the face.  I did smack him in the face one time.  He disrespected me.  Yep.  I backhanded him across the face.  I knocked his hat off.  And he ran away and I laughed.  Yeah, you say fear that, bitch.  Did you say that?  Yeah.  No, I don't show you off.  I just slap him.  We got to give Wesley Snipes a Carlos Mencia shirt.  Oh, yeah.  Then he'll go after him.  Yeah.  Let's go to Stephen and Rockland.  Stephen.  Not the best of friends.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Good morning.  You guys are wondering why Jimmy's all fucked up.  The guy watched his grandmother die.  Tried to shove nitroglycerin down her throat. 
[03:28:30]  No, I didn't see her die.  She just had a heart attack.  Oh, I thought that's what you said.  No, no, no.  I put...  She had the heart attack.  I put nitroglycerin under her tongue.  It was disguised as my penis.  No, I'm kidding.  I put nitroglycerin under her tongue.  She actually died in the hospital, though.  That's still pretty fucking tragic.  Jesus.  Not that day.  All right.  We should take a break here.  What kind of this thing is?  It's Bob Kelly and Ralphie May in studio.  And we'll continue in just a bit.  I smell dead people. 
[03:29:00]  I farted.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Do you kiss on the birthday?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Yeah, yeah, whatever.  All right.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Wait, can I give a quick thank you, by the way, to Doom Warfare?  No!  He sent me Mondo Topless.  I can't wait to watch it.  Thank you, buddy, very much.  I just got it.  That's very cool.  Well, we were talking about hurricanes and... 
[03:29:30]  Scuba diving, and Bob Kelly was very excited to get in on the conversation  and decided to tell us about his snuba.  He did snuba adventure.  What is snuba?  It's a cross between snorkeling and scuba diving.  Why do you do scuba diving?  I get it.  What is it?  Actually, how did they make scuba diving faggot?  Snorkeling is cooler than snuba.  Really?  Yes.  I really was trying.  I thought you would...  Well, Opie was like, yeah, they get great diving.  And he's like, yeah, I was 20 feet under the water there, and wow, that's impressive. 
[03:30:00]  What is it?  A big, long snorkel?  My ears hurt.  What is snuba?  Exactly.  What is it?  You have a corksucker?  They give you just like a pool of air, basically.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, not the big...  They give you a tank.  You get a tank like you.  All right.  Except you don't put it on the back.  All right, maybe it's cooler than I'm thinking that.  They put it on a float up top, and you got a 20-foot cord.  So basically, you wear the belt.  You wear everything except the tank.  Except they don't want you to have the responsibility of having the tank on your back. 
[03:30:30]  Well, you can't go down more than 20 feet.  20 feet under the water is pretty...  A lot of pressure.  It's a lot of pressure.  It's a lot of pressure.  It's enough.  There are monsters under that water.  Monsters.  That's horrific.  That's horrific.  Can you see now, or would normally your sundress blow up in your face?  That'd be sick.  I went snuggling.  Yeah, did you?  Snuggling.  What's it called?  Snuba.  Sounds like that.  Snuba.  Snuba.  They got to change the name to make it sound cool.  Aren't those pillows?  They saw it there. 
[03:31:00]  You know when you're talking to Opie during the break, and he takes out a pen and a piece  of paper, and you're like, ah.  And starts jotting it down.  Fuck me.  Snuba.  They should give that a cooler name, like blowing someone.  I was 20 feet under, and it's a shipwreck.  It's like a big shipwreck.  It's unbelievable.  It's literally like 60 feet long.  It looks like they're Titanic, especially under the water.  The big fish the size of you are coming around.  It's pretty creepy.  Yeah.  And this dumb couple from Cuba, they tapped me under 20 feet under. 
[03:31:30]  I'm trying to join myself.  They're like doing the sign language.  They give me the camera, and I start snapping photos.  I look.  It's a regular disposable camera.  They just took it under the water.  They thought it was Cuba.  These fucking morons.  What do they know, dude?  They probably swam there from their home apartment.  They didn't even know where they were.  They weren't even on the tour.  They just swam in.  They thought you spoke Cuban.  They thought you spoke Cuban.  And that's when you ended up with the snow up.  They didn't know.  I saw a moray eel.  Yeah.  I was in Hawaii for my honeymoon, and we were snorkeling. 
[03:32:00]  It was off of Maui, off of the Black Rock right there.  And the guy who was out there with us teaches us, I don't know, he was out there.  I don't know.  And I was snorkeling, and fish all around me, and something big and cold touched me.  I looked down, and it was the largest fucking turtle I've ever seen in my life.  It was bigger than me.  Okay.  And it was all gnarly and had shit growing off of it, and it scared the shit out of me.  Ain't no reason to go underwater like that. 
[03:32:30]  What the fuck is under there?  It scared the fuck out of me, man.  It's amazing.  Discovery Channel in high definition.  It's all I need, my friend.  It's amazing.  Fuck going down there with those monsters.  When you go down about 100 feet or so, and you get to like, you know, swim.  100 feet.  Yeah, his cord doesn't go down.  100 feet.  Yeah, 100 feet.  That's going to take you.  100 feet.  Your mic stinks today, Gavin.  I noticed that an hour ago.  I was hoping someone was going to fix it.  Well, talk into it.  Hello, hello, hello. 
[03:33:00]  That's better.  Maybe you have to be right on top of it.  So now I apologize to the people I just learned.  Make like you're snooping and put it in your mouth.  Yeah, exactly.  But when you snooble, do they actually give you balls to cup?  I actually did.  The mouthpiece is a cock.  Yeah.  And you hold the ball.  And it's actually some Hawaiian instructor holding your head under.  It's in this tub and they fucking throw like little super goldfish and you eat them.  Yeah, a little batist.  No, the food I mean, like the little snack food.  Oh, yeah.  The multicolored goldfish.  It's cheesy. 
[03:33:30]  I actually did the other one, too, where it's like a little scooter.  Oh, you did a little scooter?  It's like it's a bubble of air over you, like a little submarine.  Yeah.  From your nipples down is in the water, like in a scooter.  And you just go.  You can ride around like a little motorcycle.  And you zoom around the bottom like this little road.  And you follow the fat guy and his wife.  That's pretty wild.  How far down are you?  20 feet.  Oh.  I think 20 feet.  Let me tell you something.  As you're going down, he goes down 100 feet, man. 
[03:34:00]  That's a lot of.  That's the other.  Dude, that pressure was killing me at 20.  You got to know how to equalize, my brother.  You got to push it.  Welcome to the world of your feet.  That was very hurtful.  I'm very hurtful, but very precise.  Yeah.  Almost like a surgeon on that one.  Wow.  My feet try to blow their nose to release the pressure.  Wait, let's say hi to Chris in North Carolina.  Chris?  Yeah, I just wanted to let Bob Kelly know that I'm not a historian, 
[03:34:30]  but I think the Titanic was a little bit longer than 60 feet.  Punching out.  The key word would be like, jackass.  I know that.  I exaggerated to get the fucking point across.  You dumb redneck.  It's not.  And you're like a cunt.  How's that sound?  Dude, it was like the Titanic.  The boat.  No, no.  The DVD thing.  It was only a couple feet long.  What's wrong with you, Bob?  He's so angry.  I don't know.  He just made me.  I didn't like his fucking...  He made me mad.  I'm sorry.  Bob, why?  Because you said something about my feet, and I took it out on him. 
[03:35:00]  I went home and kicked the dog, Jim.  I was molested!  Thank you for being happy.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  What just popped out there?  What just popped out?  Snooba.  Snooba.  I want to go snooba diving.  Let me ask you a question.  When you go down to 100 feet, what kind of fish do you?  You must see sharks and stuff down there, right?  I've never seen a shark.  Good fish.  I've seen, like, long barracudas and turtles and...  I don't know.  How about a nurse shark?  Did you ever see a nurse shark?  Nurse shark.  Those big, worthless sharks. 
[03:35:30]  With the fangs.  They don't really bite you.  But they do nothing.  They can bite you.  They don't even smother the elderly like we're good nurses.  They bite a lot of people.  They bite a lot of people, Jim.  Oh, fuck a nurse shark.  I'll put my dick in its mouth and laugh at it.  It'll bite it off.  You get bitten by a nurse shark, put a fucking gun in your mouth.  Yeah, the reason they bite a lot of people is because they're real shallow, and people step  on them, and they bite you.  Well, yeah, they're reacting, like, hey, your foot's on me.  Right.  That's why they bite a lot of people.  Great white, you don't have to step on for it to fucking bite you.  It doesn't just lay like a big fat nothing.  Hi, I'm a nurse shark, are you?  I'll fucking, I'll pick it up by its cock and throw it. 
[03:36:00]  The craziest, there's no joke here, but when I started scuba diving in Turks and Caicos,  that was about 60 to 70 feet down, okay, beginner dives more or less, and there's a shelf.  Don't tell me.  And the instructor, like, was really cool, so he let us go over the shelf.  Ah, that scares me.  In a semicircle and then back, you know what I'm saying?  So we go out a little bit, and it was just complete darkness.  It's fucked up.  And then we get back on the boat, and he goes, yeah, where I had you guys out, it drops 
[03:36:30]  pretty much a mile straight down.  That's so fucked up, man.  Jesus.  You just swim down there.  I'm glad you didn't tell me, you know, tell me beforehand.  Oh, I just thought.  That square will come up and eat you?  I just thought maybe it was another 100 feet or so, even that would be, you know, death.  You feel like you're falling, right?  I was sinking into the boat.  No, no, you don't, you kind of, like, you don't know which way is up, because, you know,  you're spinning around and stuff, you fool around with a little bit of bubbles, right?  And you're all equal.  I mean, you're wearing so much belt that...  Well, no, the whites are a bunch. 
[03:37:00]  No, the whites are a bunch.  I could have had you, but that was like, that was crazy, yeah.  That's just, that thought of that is retarded.  And you just look out, and all you see is just complete darkness, and you're wondering  what's on the other side of it.  I was actually, the middle of the boat was cracked open.  Apparently, this big, huge vessel was on the...  Exactly.  It was just cracked open, and you...  I think when you let your air out, you sink, right? 
[03:37:30]  Something like that.  How do you...  When you let your air out, when you breathe out, you'll go down.  I don't know the rules of snoop, I'm sorry.  Here's the rules of snoop, when the cock pops out of your mouth, you're done snooping.  Do you wear a weight belt?  No.  I'm not stepping into that fat joke yet, man.  You're out of your mind.  You think I'm stupid?  I swear to you it wasn't a fat joke.  There's a fucking bomb DeLuise joke coming in.  He's wearing an asteroid belt.  Better get a cruise ship anchor to... 
[03:38:00]  I was going to ask, because I know that the weight belt you use to give you neutral buoyancy  with the tanks on your back.  You wear one.  So you wear one.  You wear one.  It's not like it's heavy.  He took my weight belt and kept taking weight out of it.  He basically gave me a belt with no weight.  He wound up having to put swimmies on his arms.  He gave me a Chanel belt.  I was going to say, he gave you a belt with styrofoam.  He should have given you a belt of scotch.  That's kind of funny.  Yeah, that was good.  Can I never get a car crash, do you? 
[03:38:30]  That was good.  Thank you.  Are you kidding me?  I'll give him this.  Jesus.  I never get a car crash.  They call me Harry Chapin sometimes.  Oh, he bounds immediately.  You saw a barracuda.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw a barracuda when I was snorkeling.  Scary looking.  Man, and they say, oh, they won't bite you, mate.  Don't worry about it.  I don't believe it.  It's bullshit.  I was pretty much freaked out by that.  Barracuda is unbelievable.  You want a fucking pirate ship? 
[03:39:00]  I thought he just said that.  Who told you not to burn on your shoulder?  They won't bite you, mate.  They won't bite you, mate.  I did that for this tea-sipping jackass next to me.  Did they tell you that?  What are you doing?  Big of them, Mike.  What are you doing?  Grimshaw?  Jason from Rye on the NCP back.  I love how grown-up Anthony is.  Ope.  This is...  Wait.  Ope.  What's on the other side?  This doesn't make sense, but it says Ope.  What's on the other side?  Ant.  Monsters.  Yeah.  What about it? 
[03:39:30]  Monsters.  Yeah.  That's all that's down there are monsters.  That's what I keep saying.  No, there...  There's no monsters.  There's monsters down there.  They don't breathe air.  Right.  You're in their environment where the second you don't have your fucking air with you,  you're dead.  Giant squids.  That shit.  What?  There's a sneaky snuba cord.  Snuba.  Yeah, just climb up your snuba cord.  I'm telling you.  That's a lifesaver.  When you got that, you can always look up.  I was sinking in the middle of the boat.  Like I said, I had a big crack.  All of a sudden, you just start sinking, and it just goes dark. 
[03:40:00]  What do you do?  Just start jerking the snuba wire?  It goes dark in the boat.  It raises you out of the water.  Look at 20 foot.  You don't go dark.  It doesn't go dark.  Listen to me, dude.  20 feet down?  I was in the boat.  In the vessel.  I'll be in the vessel.  Is it his bath?  He's acting like he's doing some deep-seed diving with one of those big helmets.  Him and Jacques Cousteau just brought it out of the Steinbeck novel.  It was dark.  You climb down the boat ladder, and you close your eyes.  The floor of the ocean. 
[03:40:30]  Open your eyes, you dummy.  Fringy feet.  I forgot the second.  Stupid guess, and open your eyes.  Oh, wait.  You're right.  I did close my eyes.  I was in the boat.  They turned the lights off at the aquarium.  You were in fucking Vegas in the MGM just looking at fish in the hallway.  I'm snubing.  Snubing.  I was in.  Let me explain myself a little better and help you guys out.  Maybe you misunderstood.  Apparently, we went down the wrong track, and it might have been my fault. 
[03:41:00]  Oh.  I was in.  There's a big boat.  Okay.  A vessel.  A vessel.  And it had a hole in it from one of the explosions.  Well, you're going down there for booty and gold.  Linear de Blu.  And then, as I sunk into the hole, I like to call it the abyss.  An octopus guy came out.  Yeah, the abyss.  And it got dark.  David Jones.  It got very dark.  What happened next, old cum beard? 
[03:41:30]  He meant peg leg, and he put the peg right in his asshole.  He got fucked by it.  That's a long job.  They have a bumper sticker now that says, I'd rather be snubing.  Wow.  You don't put it on your car.  You put it on your broth bowl.  The game's over.  Fucking homo.  Wow.  You're an adventurer.  Oh, my God.  You're a risk taker, man.  Wow. 
[03:42:00]  Did you also go to Seaside Heights on a safari?  Shit.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Fucking snuba, man.  Oh, I had to fucking slap your face.  I cannot wait to see the Photoshop.  It got dark down there.  It got dark down there.  It got dark down there.  Plenty dark it was.  Amazing.  18 feet.  Fucking only went out into fucking a mile fucking foot of water.  Nah, it was...  I'm in 20 feet.  It was dark.  It was... 
[03:42:30]  I'd reached the end of me snuba line.  We go to my blog snuba.com.  They'll need the rest of my story.  Two of us went in the water.  Two of us come back out.  You were on the Indianapolis, huh?  Yeah.  I'll never snuba again.  We were floating in the water.  Cocks all over.  We had to fight there to suck them.  It's not a good Robert Schub.  It wasn't.  It was actually fucking a good Bono from U2.  Can you hear the...  Bono from U2?  Sorry, Bono. 
[03:43:00]  I was killed hitting a tree skiing.  Jesus.  Wow.  I'm fucking fluffed it.  Wow.  I'm never going to...  Cross that one out.  Cross snuba out of your fucking notebook of death.  Oh, snuba.  Fucking goddamn notebook sucks.  That mean self-esteem's been smashing that fucking notebook.  That's like the fucking...  What's that?  That movie with the book with...  Snuba equals sucking nuts underwater with balls in ass. 
[03:43:30]  Wow.  Thank you, Jason from Rye.  What are you saying?  Like the movie with the book?  The notebook?  What's that?  No, no, no.  That movie.  It's not an adventure if you can hear him...  It's not an adventure if you can hear him talking on the boat.  Yeah.  That's what that book is.  If you look up and you see two guys on the dock, you're not fucking scoop...  Yeah.  There's no dock.  You're out in the middle of the fucking ocean.  Yeah.  Yeah, you are.  Because the middle of the ocean is 20 feet deep.  It's not 20.  It's 60 feet.  It's 60 feet.  It's 60 feet.  Exactly.  You said 20.  You don't go to...  I can only go 20. 
[03:44:00]  You're in a lagoon.  You're in a central park.  I'm telling you right now.  He's in the deep side of the pool, folks.  That's the pool.  He's going to make it down to the drain.  He's going to piss and everything.  You guys can't get him out quick enough.  You're like fucking Barracuda.  I feel like I'm back snubbering again.  Give me that notebook.  That Necronomicon.  Whatever the fuck it is.  The only thing...  Did he say snubbering?  That's hilarious.  Snubbering R.  Look how pigeon shoots on him.  That was snubbering.  The only thing that went down was you on the instructor. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, fuck it.  Oh, wow.  That's not even...  I really tried to bond with O.  Yeah, snubber.  He went, really?  He went like this.  Excuse me.  What did you say?  Snubber?  When I heard you say snubber, I just...  Like, in my head, I went, oh, my God, no.  It's over.  And I had to ask what it was.  20 feet's not even deep enough to get a Kennedy victim out of the water.  I'm fucking taking deeper dives than fucking Manhattan clam chowder. 
[03:45:00]  Thanks, you snubber story.  Big fucking deep sea adventure.  Fucking get a friend with a pool and fuck yourself.  It's not an adventure if you can touch the bottom of the pool, yeah.  Fucking hell.  I...  Jesus Christ.  Stupid Norton's spitting up fucking almond dust.  Oh, it makes me so happy.  I can't believe this is so great.  I'm going to go snubbering again in a couple weeks. 
[03:45:30]  That's great.  Have fun.  How long does it...  You have to go...  You have to get a license to snubber.  I think you dive, right?  I'm a loser because I'm not certified, so every time I go on vacation, I go through the dumb  courses again.  How long does that take?  I've gone through the courses three or four times.  What did you get through the Nauticard?  I'm just an idiot.  How long does it take?  Honestly, to get certified on vacation, you can do it in a week.  Yeah.  But I'll do a quick refresher course for like, I don't know, like an afternoon and then  I'm diving again because I talk my way. 
[03:46:00]  Do you learn in the water or no?  It's easy, man.  It's the coolest thing I've ever done in my life.  Can you get certified?  It's scary, dude.  I'll tell you what, man.  You can get certified in pools in Manhattan.  Folks out there, don't ever do that, okay?  Get certified before you go in the ocean.  Where do you go, though?  Huh?  Where do you go?  It's easy.  Last year, I went to the Cayman Islands.  Yeah.  And then the water is just crystal clear.  Cayman Islands was awesome because you take a boat out, it's not even a half mile offshore  and those dives are only 60 or 70 feet, but it's perfect.  That's it.  It's 60, 70.  You run out of cord. 
[03:46:30]  I was 60.  I was 60 feet.  The boat is 60 feet.  You're out.  You said 20, though.  No, you can only go 20.  The cord only allows you to go 20.  They don't want you going any deeper than that.  Oh, so you're floating.  You're floating in 60 feet of water.  Oh, I got you.  Here's what you want to do.  It's the same thing.  It's deep.  It's off the cord.  I mean, it's really deep.  Yeah, but you can only look down.  No, you get to go down 20 feet.  So you can literally go sink inside of this wreck.  You can only sink 20 feet.  But it's inside of a vessel. 
[03:47:00]  Is it?  Why don't you do this?  How creepy is it to go 20 feet down, Opie?  Honest to God.  20 feet is nothing.  Like I said.  How creepy is it to go 60 feet down, Opie?  It's not that bad.  How creepy is it to know that there's things around you?  No.  How creepy is it when you know there's monsters in the closet?  How creepy would it be to see you in swim trunks with a bell on your head?  Ding, ding, ding.  You quickly realize when you scuba dive that just about everything in the water scared you. 
[03:47:30]  Not everything.  Just about.  That's the key.  Just about.  Well, everything I saw.  98%.  Here comes that 1-2% that isn't.  You know.  Dude, a bull shark or a tiger shark.  It's just crazy.  Not even a great white.  A great white doesn't go near warm water.  I saw reef sharks when I was snorkeling.  It was part of the thing we did.  How big is a reef shark?  They look like.  They look like.  They're.  I don't know.  It depends.  A white tip can get up to.  8 feet or so.  A white tip can get up to like 10, 12 feet.  Somewhere in the Bahamas that you.  Well, this is the problem with the Bahamas. 
[03:48:00]  You go down there.  They don't have rules like America.  Bill Burr and I talked about this.  It's all good.  Everything's all good.  It's all good.  We went snorkeling.  They said you go to three different spots and the third spot you get to see nurse sharks.  And what they do basically is a part of this area.  They have a like.  I don't think Jimmy likes the nurse.  They have a.  They have like a bait box.  Yeah.  That they leave on the bottom of the ocean, which is honestly 40, 50 feet down, I guess.  So you're snorkeling on the top of the water and you get to see the nurse, the reef sharks  come and feed, you know, from the feed box or whatever. 
[03:48:30]  But then they start circling up because they're curious.  And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden the instructor's like, all right, everyone out  of the water.  Like, you know, they're taking a chance every time they do this run.  Yeah.  The sharks probably aren't going to bother you.  And then when we all got in the boat, they started throwing chum.  And these things were jumping out of the water and just in a huge feeding frenzy.  And you're thinking, I was just in the water with this crap?  Yeah.  That's retarded.  I was 15.  I was in Australia.  And the family, the host family that had us, they had like an 82-foot yacht and they would 
[03:49:00]  take people out there.  There's an island off of Melbourne.  It's two islands.  One's a penguin sanctuary.  The other one's a seal sanctuary.  What do they hand you when you go to them?  A bat and a video camera?  No.  No.  You can't even land at them.  There's no place to land.  It's just two rocks.  But the channel in between, it's got the most amazing sharks.  These great whites will breach out of the water to kill a seal.  So you'll just be sitting there and you'll see a bunch of seals and then all of a sudden  one will just take off flying in the air. 
[03:49:30]  They'll just, boom, just be launched out of there.  It makes you real small.  Do you go to the penguin sanctuary?  Wah, wah, wah.  Steel toad boots.  Black blood dripping on the...  You go have some lamps.  Here's your fucking metal boots.  Have a lamp.  There's plenty of them.  Max from Fairfield.  Take a golf club.  Max?  Yeah, the water was only 20 feet, but it displaced to 60 as soon as Bob stepped into it.  That's pretty good, Max. 
[03:50:00]  This guy's using water displacement in a joke.  No, he really did.  I just...  In the ocean.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  A seal sanctuary and a fucking penguin sanctuary.  I don't know where I'd want to lay barbed wire first.  Oh, my dick is hard.  Just thinking of all the things I could slap with fat stomach.  Look at the seal.  Wah, wah.  Whack.  A nice golf club to the belly.  Dude, these...  Yeah, I'm not some faggotty environmentalist kid.  These seals get thrown up like 20 feet in the air, dude.  It's amazing.  They just...  I mean, these like 400-pound seals just flying. 
[03:50:30]  Just pieces of them just...  Followed by a great white.  Phenomenal.  Love the snuba.  Oh, I'd fucking push them into the water if I saw a shark fin.  Wah, wah, wah.  Fucking boot right to the back of its fucking blackhead.  Bon voyage.  Yeah.  Beat it.  White stomach.  Phenomenal.  God damn.  Anything else you want to share, Bob?  No.  Normally you have that pen and that notebook near you.  Any other tender moments?  Really?  What the fuck? 
[03:51:00]  I just wanted to be fucking, you know, like...  Did you find a bird to fill in the nest?  Snoover Buddies, Opie.  I wanted to be...  I want to...  Hey, you got stories.  I got a knife.  I bought a knife for my ankle in case something would happen.  Hey.  You know when you want to meet...  You know when you meet Snoover Buddies?  There's a hole in the wall while you're watching pornographic videos.  Snoover Buddies?  Yeah.  I need some air.  And he puts his fucking oxygen hose through.  And then he shoots some air down your throat.  You chew some gum and go home.  Let's go to Corey in Jersey.  Corey.  Hey, Opie. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  You were saying you can get certified in a pool in Manhattan.  That's true.  Yeah, because you got to do your open water dive, right?  Yeah, but you can do your...  You can do all your courses and stuff.  Yeah.  Pools in Manhattan just teach you how to be raped by wilding teenagers.  You can do your dives in the islands, though.  Yeah, no, I was mistaken.  You can take all the classes and stuff, but you still have to do, like, an open water dive.  How much does it cost?  You know, it varies.  Like, a fancy guy like Opie, you know, he could have whatever schedule he wants.  You know, I used to charge...  I taught diving for about 12 years. 
[03:52:00]  And, you know, a fancy man like Opie, I'd charge him a couple grand, and, you know, he's good.  How much do you charge an unfancy fat man that snoopers?  Of course, probably 300, 400 bucks.  That's it?  That's it.  So, two grand for Opie and 350 for me?  Well, I...  At least you could do it like a man.  Yeah.  Well, you don't...  Hey, sir, are you a professional?  You're a professional.  Is snooping...  Is that...  That's not bad, right?  No, it's...  It's Liberace gay.  Yeah, it really is. 
[03:52:30]  You're very, very, very...  Now, how much does a tank cost?  Do you have to buy your own tank?  No, you can...  Or is it like barbecuing?  Do you just go and you return that tank and get a brand full one?  Propane...  How much does a suit cost?  Does it come in double X suit?  You don't need a suit.  Get all kinds of suits.  Yeah, they go up to about a double X and then they stop because I've tried to get...  I've got to get a vest made for me if I want to go.  I've got a guy that weighed over 400 pounds.  Would you teach him to stop eating?  I would.  Apparently not. 
[03:53:00]  All right, Corey, thank you.  What did you do?  Eating the fish like lamb?  Yeah.  He was eating fish like sushi just in the water.  He's chasing squid.  Let's say hi to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Hey, Bob, lift up your shirt and show the guys your propeller scar.  Fucking manatee bastard.  That propeller scar.  I like the fucking manatee at the end.  Just in case no one got it.  Just in case nobody got it.  Even though he did get it.  He threw that in.  He threw the ending in.  That was pretty good, you fucking jackass. 
[03:53:30]  We have a clip of John Carr singing.  We do want to get out of here.  We've got a meeting to do today.  Who's John Carr?  That comedian that...  Yeah.  Hilarious.  It's quick.  That's great, dude.  All right, let's hear this guy.  Just like Doug stand up to me.  Oh, what was he singing?  I got to hear this song.  He was in a band.  Thank heaven.  He was in a band?  Thank heaven.  What?  What is it?  He's at a church.  He's at a church thing?  Church, of course.  Oh, yeah.  They all are.  Couple with Down syndrome get married. 
[03:54:00]  We got to talk about that tomorrow.  That's tomorrow's show.  I can't watch that.  I'll tear up.  So am I.  He's pretty good.  Sounds like a bitch.  That's him singing?  Yeah.  It's not bad.  Yeah, it's cool.  Sam gave the thumbs up.  That's him singing.  It's not bad, actually.  Who, Sam?  Yeah.  Sam singing?  Sam. 
[03:54:30]  Sam.  Cutie pie.  Sam.  What was he saying?  I don't know.  I didn't recognize it.  What was he singing?  What song?  You know what he was singing?  No, that's how long the singing clip was.  That was it, huh?  It was a package of home videos,  and that was the only thing.  Why does the news only give you that  when they know we'd sit and watch  hours of this fucking maniac?  Dude, I want to see every song he sang.  I want to see the bloopers.  I know.  I bet it's on YouTube.  I hate when the news does that.  It's got to be on YouTube.  Yeah, good point.  Kenny's in here.  What does this mean?  What, Kenny?  What?  What? 
[03:55:00]  Awful fact you have to report.  Oh, boy.  The TVs are not fitting in any vehicles  that we have,  so they're going to be delivered  to your abodes.  Not even in mine?  No, because they have to be  transported upright.  You can't lay them flat.  No, you can't.  Yeah, so...  So tell them to save mine until I...  Oh, no.  Someone take it.  I need mine delivered immediately.  Yes.  You'll have...  What did you get?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did you get a TV?  You guys got TVs?  What kind?  For being you, you just got TVs. 
[03:55:30]  42-inch.  That's what they do.  42.  Tell them to take it back.  I want to get it back.  Yeah, that's what I got.  That's right.  Tell them the 42's not good enough for me.  They can't afford...  42 in a car.  I'll put this in my snuba bathroom.  Snuba.  Yeah, 42-inch with a snuba.  Let's go to Leo.  Leo?  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  You guys just got back from vacation.  You guys going to leave early again today?  You guys been doing that for the last few weeks? 
[03:56:00]  We ain't leaving early.  Leo.  Who's this cunty guy?  I don't know.  We're going to leave early.  Yeah, shut up, Leo.  We have snuba courses.  You're leaving early.  You can do some bonus show.  Leo, we're not leaving early.  We work till 11.  We're going to be leaving early Thursday because we're going to be on Letterman.  Well, we miss you for a whole week.  We'd like to give maybe some bonus show.  And we have a meeting today.  I thought that Letterman got canceled.  What are you, crazy?  You know something we don't?  Because we're planning on being there Thursday. 
[03:56:30]  Jesus.  And the lead guest, Julian Moore.  Wait, I'm sorry.  Wait, guys.  No, do your thing.  Do your thing.  Have fun with snubbering, huh?  Snubber.  What?  Leo?  A few weeks before you guys went on vacation.  We had meetings.  You had photo shoots.  You had commercials.  We're very busy men now.  We have meetings like every fucking day.  We're giving you five hours of radio, sir.  Sometimes we leave early just to count the cash.  There's TVs downstairs.  We want more.  You'll get nothing and like it.  What time is it, Leo? 
[03:57:00]  Go to the Tweener Center.  All right.  Love you, guys.  Love you, Jimmy.  Bye, Leo.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Tweener Center.  September night.  So that was a clip of John Carr singing.  That was terrific.  He's not a good singer.  He's a better murderer.  He's a better child rapist.  What's that one?  Tomatoes spicy.  We'll end with this today.  What is that?  Everything nice.  I'm not a big fan of Mayor Nagy or Nagin.  Mayor Nagin.  Oh, that fucking jackass.  Chocolate city. 
[03:57:30]  But what he said about this city will be chocolate.  Again, if you know how I'm saying.  Every time he talks, he just sounds like, you know, he's a big guy.  I don't know.  A lot of controversy because he said some stuff about Ground Zero.  Comparing it to what's going on in New Orleans.  Really?  I got to know a fight with a fight.  Steve Byrne had his girlfriend in the car and she said, I got to know.  I almost kicked her out of the car.  I called her a dumb twat.  She said that what happened in Katrina was worse than September 11th. 
[03:58:00]  I go, did you just compare the fucking two?  Stop it.  You dumb twat.  There's no comparison.  Well, at least you made a smart argument.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Fucking CNN.  I spent a fucking hour and a half talking about you shitting on people.  Bob, there's a line between shut up, you dumb twat, and CNN.  There's a balance in there.  Oh, you're right.  I'm sorry.  There's a balance in there.  I'm going to therapy.  Bob acted like I was being all snooty, like he messed up the death count by 50 in Katrina.  There was 180.  No, it was 230.  All right, CNN. 
[03:58:30]  But when you called her a dumb twat.  Yeah.  And I said, you might not have wanted to do this.  Yeah, there is kind of a gray area.  You should have called her a dumb twat for dating that middle.  9-11.  9-11 was a lot worse.  9-11 was a lot worse.  That was my point.  Of course.  Because a lot more white people were affected.  God damn it.  I was absolutely going to say that.  Unbelievable.  We got one in studio and he's big.  I was trying to think is Gavin.  Just because he's from.  Oh, wait a minute.  He's black?  Just because he has a fucking faggy accent.  I had no idea. 
[03:59:00]  What do you think he was?  Gavin is the scariest dude I've ever seen in my life.  I don't know.  I've been abused by a lot of fucking fat white guys.  Exactly.  Here we go.  Gavin would beat the shit out of you and laugh the whole time.  He's that type of guy.  He'd take out his fucking uncircumcised cock and just mush it in your face without getting  hard.  That's right.  You keep rolling it around.  Still working.  Just keep rolling it around your cheek and stick it in your eye socket and it still doesn't  get hard.  You fucking stupid bullshit fat prick.  You're saying he'd hold the back of your head and mush his cock out of your face and 
[03:59:30]  just mush it around and he just never gets hard because it doesn't do anything for him.  Just mush it around.  I can still see my cock.  Thank you very much.  We were in the steam room.  Are you going to take that?  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  Whatever he has to give, I'm going to take it.  And if he wanted me to fucking blow him right now, I'd do that too.  I'd snoober suck him.  No choice.  I'd just snoober his ass in the steam room.  Worked out at my gym.  I got a gym in my building. 
[04:00:00]  Nice.  Remember the little steam room?  What is it?  The sauna in the building?  Yeah.  It's like a two person sauna.  So I go in.  I got my socks, my sneakers, my watch, my shirt, my shorts, everything I had in the gym  on.  This guy comes in.  He's what?  How tall are you?  Six four?  Six five.  Six five.  He comes in butt naked and sits right next to me.  That's what Europeans do.  That's what we do.  You don't go in a sauna with your clothes on.  I've never been that.  I was like, oh, here it goes. 
[04:00:30]  I thought he liked me as a person, but I was wrong again.  White down on his piece of wood and shut up.  Oh, God.  I was wrong again.  Like if he just wanted to tell you that you look good, just kiss your neck.  What's wrong, mate?  It's just a fucking uncircumcised cook.  Did he sit down and then shut his cock in the door?  His cock kept slipping through the slacks on the fucking bench.  That was so nerve wracking.  Same length as a snoober hose. 
[04:01:00]  That's what you're doing, man.  Don't tell me that people in America are going to sauna to clothes on, please.  Yeah, we do.  Dude, when I just met you, I have a bathing suit.  I want to go in my sauna.  Dude, I would go into this.  If it wasn't a two-person sauna, yes, I can agree with that.  If your forearm wasn't touching my forehead, I would agree with you.  Yes, we could be naked together.  You know what, dude?  There was no steam to fog up the fucking private areas, and you're 6'5".  I'm 5'8", and fat. 
[04:01:30]  All right?  There's no room for me next to you naked in a sauna.  We're friends, don't we?  I know we are.  I love you to death.  You're one of my best people in the world, but you've got a huge, uncircumcised snuffleupagus.  If I was walking around with a maggot, it'd be no good, would it?  What was it?  If I was walking around with a maggot, it'd be no good.  No, well, I had a fucking little fucking mushroom cap.  From working out, my dick actually gets smaller.  It just fucking went inside.  Pops out like fucking still photography photos of a daisy. 
[04:02:00]  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe?  Hey, Bobby Kelly just reminded me, Otto had the line of the night Saturday night.  He called everybody up in the lawn seats, Katrina victim.  That's funny.  That was a great one.  The whole show was great, but I was so happy to see Otto.  Yeah, don't forget to watch the bootleg video clips from the PNC Art Center show.  It's on YouTube.  Is Otto and George on the Philly show?  No.  We're trying to get him open. 
[04:02:30]  Definitely the Cleveland one.  He was a last minute ad and he just killed.  Yeah, he's great.  He just killed.  Killed it.  All right, so this is Mayor Nagin.  And about face from the outspoken mayor of New Orleans, he's apologizing for some controversial  comments about the rebuilding of Ground Zero.  You guys in New York City can't get a hole in the ground fixed, and it's five years later.  So let's be fair.  Ray Nagin responding to questions about the sluggish recovery in his city by referring 
[04:03:00]  to what he called a lack of progress at Ground Zero.  He says he wishes he called it, quote, an undeveloped site.  Nagin says he did not mean to offend anyone and has directed his apology towards the families  of 9-11 victims.  We're kind of apology crazy in this country.  Well, what he said was kind of stupid, but, you know, basically he was saying...  I think it was the way he put it.  It was like calling it that hole in the ground pisses a lot of people off.  All right.  If he would have said, you know, Ground Zero or World Trade Center, but, you know, hey, 
[04:03:30]  that hole in the ground.  It's a grave.  It's a grave site.  Yeah.  It's not a hole in the frigging ground.  That's like if you called places in New Orleans, you know, hey, that frigging toxic toilet you  got over there, why don't you clean that up?  And it's like, you know...  I used to live in New Orleans.  You called the Ninth Ward that all the time.  Yeah.  Toxic toilet.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  It was brutal.  Yeah.  And I think it's just the way he put it.  But for people to get that upset, yeah, they're just looking for people to say things. 
[04:04:00]  And then...  Yeah.  It's like, no big deal.  So what?  And you know what?  Technically, he's right.  What the fuck has it been five years and there's still nothing going on down there?  I can't put up six buildings in my neighborhood in a year and a half.  It's all this...  I have no sun coming into my apartment in a year and a half and they can't put up the  frigging towers?  Do something.  No sun.  You know what happens?  I get very gray and depressed.  It's dreary.  It makes me want to go to Aruba and Snuba.  Snuba and Aruba.  Snuba.  Why don't you put up Manic Monday?  We know how you feel.  Yeah.  It'd be okay. 
[04:04:30]  Wow.  You know what?  I wish that people could see your disgusted faces in here just looking at me.  What?  You should have raped him in that sauna.  Yeah.  I should have.  We still got it.  We can go work out right now.  I have a big steam room.  I like the steam room better.  I'll do the pre-core.  You can bench press 700.  We'll go to the steam room and call it a day.  I do a lot of cardio more.  That's how I'm getting in shape.  Hitting the bag.  Ten rounds, three minutes each.  Oh, yeah.  Left. 
[04:05:00]  In the bag?  It hits the bag.  I have a bad foot, so I can't...  Do you even work out?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course I do.  I have to, man.  I've got to maintain that.  I'll be quite fat.  You're a big fella.  Please don't ever hit me.  No, no, no.  I'm not one of those.  You know what he'd do, too?  He wouldn't punch you.  He'd headbutt you.  That's what the English do.  They headbutt you.  With a smile.  And I'll tell you why they do that.  The glows go kiss.  Because they can't touch the ball with their hands.  The glows go kiss.  I'm not even kidding.  They use their feet.  They'll kick you and headbutt you because they're used to fucking soccer.  That sounds like the most backwards fucking... 
[04:05:30]  It's proper farting, my friend.  It's a proper Zulu war there.  That's a proper job.  Yeah, I'm telling you.  Hey, get the headbutt.  I hear they don't use their hands, those people.  Hey, those tea sippers don't use their hands.  Could be morons.  All countries have fags anyway.  Hey, I'll tell you what.  Those crumpy teeth.  Don't fucking go over there and...  Listen, I've got perfect teeth.  Thank you very much.  I know you do.  Put that in your fucking teeth.  That's why the accent's throwing me off.  I've got to be honest with you.  What accent's throwing me off?  My English accent where I'm from?  Yeah, exactly.  I never thought it would be English, to be honest with you. 
[04:06:00]  I look like some Puerto Rican from Harlem or something, do I?  Yeah, a little Puerto Rican.  A little Puerto Rican.  He's one of those that are the scariest...  He's a good-looking guy, dude.  ...in the whole world because he sounds very polite.  Why are you throwing me under the bus, too?  Just because you've been taking the old gate thing.  He's been fucking after me.  He's been after me for a while.  I'm glad you fucking said something about him.  Like, he's the type that would give you the first shot  and then after you hit him as hard as you possibly could,  he'd just maybe, like, touch his lip and go,  All right, my turn, mate.  And then you know you're just completely fucked. 
[04:06:30]  And with all politeness, he would kill you.  He'd actually do this, though.  You'd punch him once.  You'd punch him once, and he'd be like,  You're a little fucking out of your head, mate.  Just go sit down.  You'd smash him again.  Mate, no joke, man.  You're fucking interrupting my game.  And then you'd hit him again.  All right, mate.  I'm going to do this to teach you a lesson,  but no fucking harm, no fault.  Whack!  You'd wake up three days later,  you'd have an English accent and missing all your teeth.  Speaking French.  That, too.  That's why he's got such good teeth.  He's been able to hand-select them from other people's mouth.  That's his one. 
[04:07:00]  Let's go to English, guys, boss.  All right, hold on.  Let's say hi to Jesse in Pittsburgh.  Jess or Jesse?  What about that name?  Yeah, hey, guys.  Ah, goddammit.  Hey.  That's a dude.  Thought it would be a girl.  That's all right.  You stopped with an I or a Y?  What?  Hey, guys.  I'm wondering when the virus tour is coming out here to Pittsburgh.  You know, we only have two dates left,  and I think we really should think about one more after that.  Pittsburgh is doing very well for us.  You just got to do Vegas, though, too.  Yeah, because Vegas is going to be retarded.  Next summer, we don't have a summer, unfortunately, 
[04:07:30]  because this thing's going to explode.  I know.  It's all fucking...  Jimmy, I'm going to see you on 28th out in the Improv in Pittsburgh.  See ya.  When am I on the 28th of, uh...  When am I there?  September.  You should do the virus show during the Porn Awards weekend.  Oh, really?  That would be a great show.  Keith, Jersey, what's up?  Boys, how you doing?  Good.  The show Saturday was awesome.  One complaint?  Dude, FM.  Stupid wheel.  You stand on line for freaking 20 minutes to spin a wheel to get nothing? 
[04:08:00]  Not even a wow sticker.  Not even XM wow sticker.  They didn't have wow stickers at the event?  None.  I bet you I would wait.  Let me guess.  Hold on.  How about when they're coming out?  Because I know what you're going to say.  Okay, you're right.  Maybe coming out, they probably should.  They probably don't allow you.  I had people asking me when I was walking up to that thing,  you guys have any wow stickers?  And I was like, why wouldn't they have wow stickers?  I'm guessing they were told not to.  Hey, PalTalk at least gave out a freaking bottle opener.  Yeah, that was cool.  I don't know.  But, you know, I got wowed for the first time in like six years at the event,  which was awesome.  One sweet stare up in the launch section, I was so happy. 
[04:08:30]  I was thrilled.  Tell us what happened exactly.  Walk us through it.  Dude, I walked on stage.  I'm like a minute into my set, and this chick is showing me her tits.  I asked her to show me her tits.  Oh, yeah.  And fucking, I didn't want to throw the set off.  And some guy leaned over and just licked her nipple,  and she starts smacking the shit out of him.  Hilarious.  God bless her.  You always see that in Girls Gone Wild.  If you see the white girl, she's holding the bottom of her shirt. 
[04:09:00]  She's about to pull it up, thinking about it.  And there's always one black dude in the background just waiting.  He's not even blinking.  He's waiting.  There's always the white guys.  Do it, Kathy.  Do it.  And she does it.  He comes up.  The black guy, you just see a black hand shake the pit and then pull away.  Watch Girls Gone Wild.  There's always a black dude.  I've never seen a Girls Gone Wild.  I can't even imagine ordering one of these fucking things or watching them.  I mean, how dirty do they get on these videos?  Yeah, I know.  Just give me porno or that shit is, the commercials alone annoy the piss out of me. 
[04:09:30]  And they've run out of ideas.  Now they got them on airplanes in like zero gravity.  They have that kooky little music.  Girls Gone Wild games where they go to Girls Gone Wild Island and compete in games.  Who gives a shit?  Show the pussy.  Hey, someone get fucked.  Play cunt ball.  I want to play sandy cunt.  I want to see them snoober topless.  Ah, there you go.  Snoober.  Wow, the callback is in. 
[04:10:00]  Snoober.  They suck our dicks for air.  Oh, thanks, Ant.  I'm going to move the snoober into my other book.  How many books do you have?  Hope he has a book.  I have the Hall of Fame book.  Everything that's mentioned.  All right, why don't we get out of here?  Let's go.  Sounds good.  Ralphie, you'll be here tomorrow, right?  I'll be here tomorrow.  All right.  Gavin, who are you beating up today?  I'm going to beat up nobody, my friend.  All right, good.  We'll see you tomorrow, maybe?  All right. 
[04:10:30]  And Bobby.  What's up?  Houston.  Houston Laugh Stop, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  Cool.  When do you fly?  You're not going there Saturday night?  I'm going to Dallas.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  Thanks.  Saturday, up to.  Dallas for me.  Yep.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  By the way, their phone number is 713-524-2333.  You guys are just hurting yourselves.  I try to help you out.  That's my number, right?  You guys just...  7 what?  713?  You're just hurting yourself.  You know, one at a time.  You only do one at a time.  I'm assuming.  All right, here's mine.  Ready?  Here's mine.  I'm going to be at the Houston Laugh Stop Wednesday, Thursday.  Dallas Improv, Thursday, Friday, Saturday only.  713. 
[04:11:00]  Not for Bobby.  524.  524.  2333.  That's not the Improv, though.  The Improv is Addison.  Get tickets for Wednesday.  For me, only Thursday, Friday, Saturday in Addison, Texas.  And I'll be there at the Laugh Stop Houston.  www.lafstop.com.  Cool.  Go to Improv.  I'll go to MySpace.  Whatever you want, dude.  I mean, I'm in the Dallas Improv this weekend.  If you want to go see me, we'd love to have you.  Come down to the Houston Laugh Stop if you want to come see me.  Yeah.  I'm in Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  I was just in Houston.  It was good.  It was good.  I like Dallas, though.  Dallas is hot, too.  Yeah, that's where I'll be.  I'm in H-Town, they call it.  H-Town. 
[04:11:30]  Every friggin' city now has to have the first letter town thing going.  I'm in Pleasant in California.  Tommy T's.  By the way, Voss and Bonnie are going to do an hour of radio on this channel Wednesday.  Cool.  I asked them for an idea, and they're going to spend an hour talking about comedy and who  their influences were and how they got into the business.  When is this going to be?  They're going to be a comedian this Wednesday from 11 to noon.  Like that comedy team thing they did, Dummy and Alan. 
[04:12:00]  That's not going to get replayed during, like, night when people might be driving and tired.  Told them to come up with an idea, that's the idea they came up with.  So they're going to talk about comedy and their influences.  Why don't they talk about people who need citizenship papers and then therefore marry retarded people?  Is she from Canada?  Yeah.  Oh, and now she's a person?  And he said that he's going to need some clips, and he's going to need a Rita Rudner. 
[04:12:30]  A Rita Rudner?  Rita Rudner?  He's going to need a Rita Rudner clip.  That better be an example of what not to do.  What is that?  They're going to talk about his old hairstyle?  I used to have hair just like Rita Rudner.  Wait a second.  Why do they need Rita Rudner clips?  I don't know.  Wow.  I'm going to have to listen to this now.  This is Rita at a New York casino in Las Vegas.  What do you need?  Two sugar cookies and a Rita Rudner clip.  Trust me, it's going to be gold.  We got a meeting to get to, so thanks, guys. 
[04:13:00]  We appreciate it.  Bye.  Bye.  Hasta mañana.  Back from vacation.  Yeah, see you tomorrow.  Later.  We got no heart.  Someone put this thing out of its misery.  Let's send out a big laugh.  Shoot it.  Yeah, let's send out a big laugh.  Let's send out a big laugh.  They already went to commercial silly.  Oh.  I didn't know that.  Why are we talking?  We're dumb.  Because you wanted to.  Is it really?  They went to commercial?  Yes, you ass.  Well, where's the fucking sound?  I don't trust you up. 
[04:13:30]  I want to keep talking.  Keep talking.  I want to do my own show.  It's called Bobby Kelly.  20 seconds with Bobby Kelly.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  This is Bobby Kelly.  20 seconds.  My influences are Jeannie Norton.  You're the buzz like you did on HBO.  Oh, buzz.  Dude, I just fucking did it.  This snoob is pretty cool, actually.  You motherfucker.  I decided to kill you for an hour.  Did you have a snoober?  Tell me you snoober.  You snoobered?  You fucking homo.  You fucking snoobered?  I just did it for the show to kill you for an hour.  Ah-ha, nice.  You want to go snoobering together? 
[04:14:00]  We'll save some turtles.  Me, you, sir.  And then we'll go boogie boarding?  Hey.  What?  Nothing wrong with boogie boarding.  Yeah, I went boogie boarding.  I'm going to throw a picture up on the website tomorrow.  The sad part is that you didn't like, there wasn't a boogie board at the house.  You just, hey, who's that?  Oh, you can use that one.  You went and bought your own boogie board.  You have an Amex with a boogie board on it.  Yeah.  And I got the wax and everything.  You have to wax a boogie board?  Yeah, so you don't get nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple. 
[04:14:30]  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  Nipple.  You getting nipple-itis?  You don't get to wear a shirt.  Nipple.  Nipple.  You should wear some kind of surf shirt, yeah.  Or get the wax down.  Who do we got tomorrow?  Anybody in?  Ralph, obviously.  Great.  So we better pad with better gas here.  Don't.  No, Damien Fay's coming in, I think.  Oh, Lindsay, I haven't seen him in a while.  I really wanted to see him last night, actually.  I was so annoyed that my tooth hurt was fucking...  Bobby, now that we're really off the air, I never fucking snooped, you faggot. 
[04:15:00]  Are you really off the air?  Yes.  Yes.  Are you stupid?  We were just on the air.  No, we weren't.  Yeah, that was the goof.  That was the goof.  Oh.  But now that we're really off, I never fucking snooped.  Why are you getting angry, though?  You can just say, you know...  Obi's hilarious.  He's fucking mood swings are priceless.  Now these fuckers think I snooped.  It's not a commercial, you ask.  Obi's...  I never fucking did that, you fucking...  You ever punch a Frenchman underwater?  What?  A story for another day.  See what you missed? 
[04:15:30]  He punched somebody underwater?  Yeah.  60 feet...  About 60 feet underwater.  Why?  Fight with a Frenchman.  Did he just pull his mask?  Why?  Because he fucked with you, right?  What's your story?  Did he fuck with you?  He laid it on top of me.  So I pushed him, he pushed me back, and then I punched him.  Underwater.  Excellent.  It was like slow motion fighting.  It was hilarious.  There were bubbles flying everywhere.  Well, because you can't get any, like, you know, traction.  There's no leverage.  So as you're punching, your legs are going this way. 
[04:16:00]  It's like you're diving.  In the middle of it, I realized how ridiculous it was, but...  It's Superman flying.  That's hilarious.  That's not fun, man.  It's fucking hilarious seeing two guys go out onto the water.  We got a meeting, for fuck's sake.  We have a meeting, for fuck's sake.  I hope we'll see you later, Andy.  I'll see you, man.  I'll see you in a couple of weeks.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bob, Bobby.  Bob, you want to be friends, or what?  Bobby.  No, not yet.  Not yet?  Not yet.  We're going to do a couple more shows.  Where's Kenny? 
[04:16:30]  Can't be friends.  I'm friends with your girlfriends.  That's my thing.  Didn't he say that, like, one day?  I'm actually better friends with your girlfriends.  I talk more to them than I talk to you guys at the shows.  Of course.  They don't realize how awful you are yet.  Yeah.  You haven't brought out that side of you.  They relate to your hobbies.  You know when I used to hang out back in the day with the guys?  They'd get in a fight with a girl, wind up slapping them up.  Oh, you'd end up in the fucking, in case of emergency, break fucking glass?  Yeah, I was the guy.  I'd walk home with him.  Great. 
[04:17:00]  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  See you in a couple of weeks.  All right, Bob.  Nothing but sunshine and lollipops.  Hi, sweetie.  What are you guys doing?  You going to a meeting show?  We haven't been here.  All right.  Do you want some food?  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  See you later.  Meeting.  Bye.  Later, gents.  Bye, kids.  See you tomorrow.  Later, man.  Yeah, we just, he just tapped your big belly.  Look at the size of his fucking toes.  That is a mitt.  Like a catches mitt.  Just smack his face, guy.  I want him to see.  Stop on his stuff once.  Oh, wow.  That would have taken his head off.  That was so cool. 
[04:17:30]  That came so close to hitting you.  The fucking way he just hit my neck.  He barely touched you.  Dude, that fucking hurt.  Shut up.  That was what the edge of his hand would have hit your neck first.  That would have chopped.  Look at your friend.  Look at those.  That would have chopped your head off.  It was going to be karate chop.  That would have chopped your fucking head off.  He honestly scares the shit out of me.  Hawk got him.  Eric, he got you.  He got you.  That's kind of weird.  That's kind of weird.  Why is it weird?  He got you.  What's weird about it?  Burn that notebook.  Bobby, you just don't know when to leave. 
[04:18:00]  Look at how you're just...  I want to eat, too.  He's awkwardly trying to leave.  Oh, my God.  Still on the air.  Of course we are.  Dope.  Hey, Bobby.  We're on the air.  Bobby, you asshole.  Bobby!  You've been on the air, stupid.  You've been on the air the whole time.  You idiot.  Do you hear us?  Do you hear us talking out there?  Does he know?  What do you think?  This is closed circuit just for the fucking studio?  I was hoping he'd admit homosexuality.  We were hoping you were going to admit you're gay, but it didn't happen. 
[04:18:30]  We've been on the air the whole time.  We don't want to talk about it.  I admit that I'm gay.  Don't you figure it out?  Anthony is walking around the studio with a mic two inches from his face.  I'm standing up with a mic in front of my face.  Guys, look.  I'm not a professional radio guy.  Oh, God.  All right.  Is that the end of the show?  How's that?  Do we end on that?  Yeah, we can end on that.  He just farted.  All right.  Later.  Later.  Later.  This is unpredictable radio. 
[04:19:00]  Oh, holy crap.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  Look at you.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  I'm a grown man, and I'm being yelled at.  You're idiots. </pre>
