<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, broadcasting live from WBCN studios in Boston, was a chaotic mix of post-River Rave recounting, celebrity encounters,  sexual innuendo, homophobic slurs, and general mayhem.  The broadcast began with a recap of their 12-hour concert experience at CMGI Field, including a backstage tour of the Patriots' locker room courtesy of Jonathan Kraft. Opie detailed his skateboarding adventures and observations of the overwhelmingly white audience at the "rave tent" despite diverse musical acts like Public Enemy and Outkast.  Jimmy Norton, a frequent guest, regaled them with stories of his interactions with Flavor Flav, the Strokes, and Papa Roach, often involving pranks on concertgoers.  A significant portion focused on Anthony and Norton’s encounter with a female listener backstage, culminating in both men kissing her after Norton's initial, extensive kiss.

The show then veered into a discussion of Boston traffic, eliciting copious cursing and exaggerated descriptions of Anthony's aggressive driving habits. This segued into homophobic remarks and graphic descriptions of men in locker rooms, fueled by Anthony's negative experience at a hotel gym.  Their accidental encounter with the Boston Gay Pride parade further fueled this discussion, accompanied by more homophobic language and commentary on the parade's music.  The hosts also complained about the inadequate beer supply at the concert, a subsequent Super Bowl ring party attended by show associate Ben, Norton's encounter with a topless woman in a bathroom, their stay at the Ritz-Carlton, and their experiences with room service and movie charges.  Their commentary included crude jokes and observations about racial segregation in Boston neighborhoods.  Throughout the broadcast, they promoted their "WOW" contest, a RisqueVideo.com sponsored photo contest with a $5,000 prize.

A substantial segment was dedicated to the impending dismissal of show regular Lady Di, resulting in a tense phone call filled with arguments and insults. Lady Di desperately attempted to save her position by proposing a song for Jim Norton, which she then sang poorly on air.  The discussion of Lady Di’s future dominated the segment, concluding with plans for a final decision.

The Mike Tyson vs. Lennox Lewis boxing match provided another focal point, with the hosts and crew offering crude commentary and playing audio clips from post-fight interviews. This discussion meandered into tangents about the River Rave, the "WOW" contest, and "Sex for Sam 3".  Two women associated with "Psycho Tim" visited the studio, leading to a humorous but degrading interaction involving one of the hosts, Earl, resulting in humiliating physical contact.

The chaotic conclusion featured a graphic description of a beer bottle incident involving Earl, which ended with him being hit with a microphone and having beer spit in his mouth.  The hosts reacted with amusement and disgust.  They also contrasted their Ritz-Carlton stay with a previous Boston hotel where they were fired.  Technical difficulties and a lack of prepared material added to the broadcast's overall chaotic nature.  The hosts repeatedly highlighted their improvisational approach.  Throughout the entire show, casual references were made to various people involved in the show, including references to the "ladies wow contest" and Lady Di's planned serenade of Jim Norton. The broadcast ended with the hosts' departure and Earl's reaction to "White America".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Everyone get their rally caps on. Yeah. It's time for the Opie and Anthony show. And we need to get a rally going. Wow. Right off the bat, we're going to call this the hangover show. Yeah. We are broadcasting live from WBCN studios in Boston. Why? Right next to Fenway Park, Anthony. Why are we here today? Well, we went to a 12 hour concert yesterday. 
[00:00:30]  A 12 hour concert. What a time, though. The world famous WBCN River Ray Band. Yeah. They've been doing it forever. This is our fourth or fifth. I've lost count already. It was at Foxborough Stadium. Well, it's now called the CMGI Field. Yeah. What does that stand for? I don't know. Anyone know? Oh, you know, right? I don't know. You got the personal tour yesterday. I got the personal craft tour. What's CMGI? What's the field? Yeah. It's a computer company. 
[00:01:00]  You don't know what the acronym is? Cut my girls' insides. No, that's your company, Norton. Yes, I got the personal tour of the stadium. The new stadium. The locker rooms of the Patriots and everything. Jonathan Kraft gave you the tour, right? Gave me the personal tour. Bob Kraft's son. Yeah. He's a big fan of this radio show, matter of fact. I know. Very cool. Showed us the locker room for the Patriots. 
[00:01:30]  Over there and his helmet and his uniform and everything. Pretty cool. And then the gym that they got in the place. And Jonathan was very proud of the sound system in there. He had a crank up Metallica. Nice.  Like blasting in this huge gymnasium that they have right in the stadium. I was also told they have a jail in the stadium just for the Pats games.  You know how the Pats fans can be called Pats? We need a few of those jails down in New York. But they have real jail cells and they hold them there. They're holding cells until the cops come and can hold these people away. 
[00:02:00]  That's classic. And I saw some shenanigans last night with some of the fans that wanted to have a little more fun than the rest of the people.  I saw cops walking by holding, like, pipes. And with the kid with his head down and his arms behind his back just all pissed and they got caught.  That's classic. Another guy's going, I'm going with you. Relax. The cop goes, don't tell me to effing relax. And he's pushing them by. 
[00:02:30]  I caught these little conversations between some of these people and the cops. Very, very fun.  What a great time, though, huh?  Yes.  I mean, this stadium is state-of-the-art. Unbelievable. We've got to start building some of these down in New York.  One of the nicest stadiums ever. Well, it's brand new. You know, they've taken, I guess, all the advice and all the trial and error from other stadiums and stuff that didn't work.  Just very roomy. You know what I mean?  Huge.  The concourse. You're not bumping into people. You can get around without getting all crowded in and stuff. 
[00:03:00]  I didn't have to put hiking boots on to get from my car to the stadium. Like in the old stadium. For some reason, I'm parked on a mountaintop.  And I had to walk down rocks and everything. This is great. Everything paved. The midway-type area that they had yesterday. Just a huge, amazing, great, the festival area.  Yeah.  Really cool.  They had a nice skateboard stand. I was checking that out all day.  Were you on the half-pipe? I looked over at one point and I go, is that all? And then I looked and it was. You were just tearing up the half-pipe yesterday. 
[00:03:30]  I figured, what the hell.  Yeah. Like the old days.  You picked up a new board. I saw a new skateboard.  You noticed, right?  Which was pretty cool. Yeah. I think you were tearing it off. Very proud. I'm like, that's Opie up there.  I'm trying, Anthony.  Tearing it up?  I'm trying to hold on to my youth.  At least you don't have to hold on to your radio show.  Went into the rave tent. They had a rave tent going on.  Yeah. I felt like ecstasy dad.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Had my glow sticks and my ee. 
[00:04:00]  Man, some hot chicks in there though.  I've never been to a whiter place. Someone has to say it.  Yeah. True.  It is ridiculous how white it is up here.  And with, you know, Public Enemy playing.  There's 30,000 kids.  Outkast.  And a few old men like ourselves.  And it was white America.  Yeah.  And they were digging Public Enemy and Outkast.  Sure.  Our own little Jimmy Norton.  I never knew.  Such a huge fan of Public Enemy. 
[00:04:30]  You're a nightmare.  And Flavor Flav.  I liked him, yeah.  To the point of embarrassment.  I had to walk away from the situation.  Did you ever have to just leave a situation because it was too embarrassing?  That's Jimmy with Public Enemy.  They were the only, well, I mean, I'm not a fan with Ozzy.  But they were the only band that I really knew.  Because you know me, I'm so stuck in what I like and nothing new for me.  Yeah.  I didn't know Outkast was black.  Dude, I'm not kidding.  I did not know that they were a rap group.  You couldn't tell from... 
[00:05:00]  I had no idea until I'm standing outside the dressing room and I see this guy walk by.  He was a black guy.  He was like one of their guys.  Yeah.  And then I think it was Ben or somebody goes, oh, yeah, that's one of the guys who's with Outkast.  And I'm like, really?  What is he, the butler?  They were...  Of course, I got a picture.  Like, oh, you guys are great.  It's all about eatabullet.com.  That's significant.  You are awful because you don't even know these people yet.  You're like, could you take a picture of me with this guy? 
[00:05:30]  And you're like, he would be a stalker if he wasn't a famous comedian and on a radio show.  Dude, you're obsessive.  But I get them and I'm not.  You wouldn't move from your spot until you got a picture with Flavor Flay.  Why not?  How could you not?  The Flay.  I'm like, we got all access.  We'll run it to Flavor Flay.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not moving.  I'm not moving until I get a picture with Flavor Flay.  For me, it's one moment in their life.  I'm not obsessive.  Once I meet them, I'm quiet.  I get the picture and I'm done.  I don't annoy them with...  Hey, remember that thing you did?  All right.  How many pictures did you take with Flay? 
[00:06:00]  I took two.  Right.  But the first one, he didn't even notice because he was looking down signing and then I got him in the artist.  Because he was busy when you imposed on him the first time.  At one point, I wanted to get him out of that area to go check out some other things.  And he goes, Flavor Flay is eating, man.  I've got to watch him eat for a while.  No, I didn't say that.  Yes, you did.  You go, there he is over there eating.  And then you go, I'll never have an opportunity again like this.  He does stuff like this.  He's embarrassing.  He's just eating.  The guy from Papa Roach I got a shot with, I don't know one of their songs. 
[00:06:30]  But you had to get a picture.  The crowd loved them.  I had to.  The crowd loved them.  Yeah.  That way on your website, you can look.  And here's me with Jim.  Yeah.  Papa Roach is kind of huge.  Dude, I admit it.  I'm not pretending I know who they are.  At least I'm not a liar.  I'm like, the dudes with the Strokes I got.  Like, one of the guys with the Strokes I got a picture with, I'm like, is that the dude?  And he's like, yeah.  I'm like, all right.  Is that the dude?  I'm an ass.  I like Public Enemy's, their security.  Oh, they're great.  When they came walking off the stage, they have, like, flak jackets on.  They're all dressed in black. 
[00:07:00]  Nightsticks.  The whole gear that all they needed was high-powered weapons.  They're dressed like SWAT team members.  Yeah, like SWAT team members.  Well, they couldn't carry their guns, so.  Of course not.  They weren't with the sticks.  At least not visibly.  I'm sure, I'm sure if someone lunged at Flav, you'd just see guns pop out of everywhere.  Who's kidding who?  Stop it.  I think he was the star of the whole day yesterday.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  When he arrived, people were pretty freaked out.  Right?  Yeah.  And they were late.  They arrived late because they went to the wrong venue.  Yeah.  They went to the Twitter center. 
[00:07:30]  They went to the Twitter center down the road.  Where is everybody, boy?  I can see that.  Look, I'm late.  Look at my clock.  They were late and there was, what, like 21 bands or something like that.  And it was a tight schedule.  So, they played for 15 minutes last night.  They were filming for their video, too.  They did Fight the Power.  I understand.  And some other tunes.  Some other tunes.  Franklin was.  They do 9-1-1 is a joke in your town.  They didn't do 9-1-1.  No.  I know that one. 
[00:08:00]  They didn't do that.  And Norton got the members of the Strokes with the Drop Something game.  Did I?  Yes, you did.  He was getting everybody with that.  And he had people like, you know, fans of the show that were just watching him laughing.  Like, they were all part of it.  Waiting for the next little Jimmy hijink.  What did you do?  You said, you dropped something and they turn around and look.  I don't even know I got them.  Someone just told me I got them.  I'm like, oh, really?  All right.  There was one woman.  We were sitting at one of the lunch tables.  And Jimmy goes, excuse me, miss. 
[00:08:30]  And, of course, turns away and looks away.  This girl comes over and goes, yes, yes.  Somebody called me and she's at the table.  And now you can't look.  So I'm just looking at my food.  Jimmy's got his head turned, but I can see he's ready to explode with laughter.  And the woman's just, yes.  And she wouldn't go away.  And it's awkward now because even if you didn't do it, you should be looking at her.  But you can't because it ruins the gag.  It's like we're in court and she's a rape victim.  No one's making eye contact. 
[00:09:00]  No one wanted to make eye contact.  And I'm ready to bust.  And then she finally goes, oh, it's one of those gags.  Walks away all pissed off.  Real funny.  And then as she's leaving, oh, and.  You know why she came back?  One of the little squealers is like, oh, there's a man calling you.  One of the girls on the lunch line.  They had like lunch line girls.  Yeah.  And what called her back?  And so she came back like she had reconfirmed that someone wasn't me calling her.  You know, at this time, I think we've got to tell Anthony we have a new gag.  Yeah.  Did you know that you made out with someone last night?  I did, did I? 
[00:09:30]  Yes, you did.  I was making out with.  Was it a girl?  One of our faithful listeners.  I was making out.  Who seemed to love you more than all of us.  Now, Opie, I did have a few beers last night.  And I know.  Not that many because perish the thought they'd supply enough beer to last everybody tonight.  Jesus Christ.  Like a scavenger hunt for beer.  Ben and you were hilarious with the beer.  The first.  So this one of you guys found the latest beer supply.  It got around like that.  But it's everybody.  Psycho, Tim, Decker. 
[00:10:00]  Everyone's got their little supplies.  And when you find some, you've got to be cool and grab a handful for everybody.  So then when you see Ben again and go, dude, found some beers.  Oh, dude.  And it's like maybe it's not a brand that you would have preferred.  But it's cool.  Who cares?  And you're drinking that.  Because I was drinking a beer I wasn't too fond of.  But I'm drinking it.  And then Ben comes in.  And he's got a few of the beers I really like, you know.  Hey, which beer would that be?  You know which ones if you listen to the show.  No, I don't.  I'm smart these days.  Which beer?  I don't put down any beer. 
[00:10:30]  You better have two in each hand.  Dude, if Meisterbrow came on board, I'd like it.  But then you can put down the beer.  Maybe it's not your favorite.  And take the beer that you like and start swigging that down.  But it could be good.  Perish the thought that they supply more than a case and a half of beer.  How many cases did we go through for the softball game?  27.  27 cases.  That's a good mark to start at next time, okay?  If you're going to be doing this and having us.  Well, they don't expect people like us. 
[00:11:00]  I know, and that was apparent.  A few hours, I'm going to have a beer after my set.  Not 12.  My point is, there wasn't quite enough beer for me to get so trashed that I'd be making out with listeners.  I'm sure this lovely lady is listening right now, and she's going to be really surprised because she thought she was making out with you, Anthony.  Gee, now why would any listener that is in your company, all of you guys, with me not being there, why would she assume that whoever she's making out with, and he better have been a good friggin' kisser, it was Rossi. 
[00:11:30]  Rossi.  Rossi, yeah?  Dude, this is a great new gag, man.  She fell for it.  Hook, line, and sinker, too.  Am I not a team player?  Hold on.  Morton hooked it up.  Yeah, we got to explain.  Stay at that mic.  It was sweet, right?  It was.  My younger brother, by the way.  Look at him.  Yeah, I know.  He could be.  Now you're twins.  Huh?  We're twins?  No, no.  Now you're, yeah.  So this girl gets backstage, and she came with some people she worked with or something? 
[00:12:00]  I think so, yeah.  And it started out, the guy goes, you know, there's Opie from the Opie and Anthony show, and she comes over, freaking out, you know, hugs me, pictures and stuff.  I'm like, oh, cool.  But jumping up and down, like a little too excited to meet us, right?  Well, I wasn't, I wasn't, when I first walked in, I walk in, and you said, look at that girl freaking out.  And I turn around, and there's a girl, like, looking at me, shaking, which is really nice.  Yeah, there you go.  Like, wow, this comedy's paying off after 13 years.  And she runs over, and she just starts kissing me.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  And, well, okay, yeah, she started kissing a little bit, but then you decided to shove your tongue down her throat. 
[00:12:30]  So what?  What am I going to do?  I'm not a nice guy.  Always accommodate the people.  She was sexy.  So what?  But then I kept going, kiss Jim, kiss Jim, and they are just going at it.  Then Jim starts sporting, and the only reason I know is because he showed everyone, I mean, he showed everybody.  How could you not?  Everybody.  Earl was there, right, Earl?  How does he grab it and just start shaking and go, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he just points it at him.  He points at him.  He's giggling.  He grabs it with one hand, points at the other, and goes, yeah.  And you're like, why are you showing me this? 
[00:13:00]  How embarrassed were you?  It was highly disturbed.  And it was in front of the production crew, and those guys were just losing their effing minds.  Because he's just spinning around, showing everybody.  He don't care.  There's like the runway where everyone was coming to him.  It was in full view.  Was she a good kisser?  Yeah, man.  Sure.  Very good.  So then Jim goes, well, that's Anthony over there, and points to John Rossi.  John Rossi's just against the wall, just minding his own business, drinking beer, hanging out backstage.  She comes running up to you, Anthony, jumps on you, and just starts completely making out with her ass. 
[00:13:30]  Really?  Yeah, I was going for it.  Why not?  Were you grabbing ass and stuff?  No.  I was trying to be around the other hand.  What did you do with the other hand?  I was, you know.  A little around the way.  Yeah, exactly.  Were you going in deep?  I was trying to.  Yeah.  And I better dealed me in a second.  That's Anthony.  Anthony, he represents you really well.  I saw it.  He just starts making out.  Rachel, our old intern who works now at WBCN, but now coming back to New York with us, she 
[00:14:00]  was there for this whole make out thing.  Rachel, was he doing a good job?  Grab that mic over there, because I don't want some girl going around thinking I kissed her.  I've never seen Rossi get along with such a stranger before in my life.  Really?  I mean, it was just sucking faith.  From a girl's point of view, looking at it, was he doing a good job?  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to.  He was way into it.  I don't know if it was just the alcohol, but maybe he just thought he was really hot.  I don't know.  He goes, I'm Anthony.  What the hell?  Okay.  I'm just going to let him down.  Because if I got to sit there and then get calls from people going, dude, you made out 
[00:14:30]  with some girl, and I know her, and she said you sucked.  And when you were done, you had a little wet spot on your thigh.  No, that was boring.  You finished just from kissing a girl?  Nothing embarrassing.  And then I'm trying to get him.  I'm like, dude, do Tyson.  Show him your Tyson.  And John's like, ah.  And John's like, ah.  Just listen tomorrow.  So he punched her in the face.  John goes, yeah, just listen tomorrow.  We'll do some Tyson.  Just listen tomorrow.  Oh, he did.  He did.  It was a whole thing going on.  Wow, that's great.  Get some.  And Rachel, what do you think of Jim and what he was sporting there? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, that's another thing I've never seen before, but I was a little surprised,  actually, by just a little kiss.  One little kiss, and he was just ready to rock any longer.  I was like three quarters, so what?  Three quarters, why not?  Hey, everybody, look, we have a little, it's nice.  Everyone laughs.  Yeah.  You know, you grab it, you shake it and point at it.  You grab the helmet, and you go, tickle, tickle, tickle.  Disgusting.  It was like more of the moment, man.  It wasn't just a kiss.  It was just the fact that I'm standing there, and some girl starts kissing me.  It was fun.  So she's kissing you. 
[00:15:30]  Was she really, like, kissing you?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then she dumps you.  She totally dumps Jim for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, just knowing that, had we been alone, we weren't alone, but I just couldn't  take it and I said, suck.  And she was like, where was this in the back stage?  Right where all the artists were coming out after they performed there?  Yeah, yeah.  Right in the tunnel.  I mean, right in front of everybody, man.  And how did this end?  Did she just go away?  We were all just, we were all laughing hysterically.  We were just all laughing hysterically, because, I mean, everyone knew it wasn't you, except 
[00:16:00]  for her.  I had to stop it before I started cracking up.  That would have been funny.  Anthony gave me the clap.  Oh, Rossi.  I'm going to have that checked out.  So she just walked away, or happy?  Yeah, she was walking away, I guess.  And then started jumping up.  She was so excited, though.  She was practically in tears, because she's like, oh, celebrities.  Oh, my God.  Was she drunk or anything?  Yeah.  Probably.  Yeah.  Yeah, you think?  You tasted some booze on her?  Why?  She jumped up and down when I walked by. 
[00:16:30]  She was loaded.  All right.  At least you did me justice.  I just don't want, you know.  It's our new gag, though, man.  Some awkward, horrid kissing going on in my name.  Rossi, you've got to grow the goatee so we can trick the next one.  That was really funny, though.  Yeah, because we're so similar in every other way.  On drugs?  How did that girl even think?  How did she recognize us as Opie and Anthony and not know he wasn't me?  No, she didn't know what we looked like. 
[00:17:00]  It was her friend that came with her.  Oh, and pointed out that that's Opie.  Yeah, pointed out me first.  Okay.  And then I pointed out Jim.  Right.  See, that's how the gag went.  It went from me.  I go, oh, and that's Jim Norton.  Yeah.  And then Jim goes, that's Anthony.  Great move, Jim.  Oh, good guy.  Great move.  That's funny.  That is very good.  You've got to share with your friends.  You are despicable.  Plus, I knew I couldn't take her anywhere.  It's not like I could take her into a bathroom.  I would have taken her into a bathroom.  You could have gone into the bathroom.  Oh.  Well, you were working one girl, and it was just embarrassing again. 
[00:17:30]  In the artist lounge area.  Oh, the girl that was decorated like a prom.  You walked through the little things that are hanging down.  Every time we walked through, we went, yay, we're at the prom.  Yeah, it was like little purple things.  Yeah, it was like a King Arthur's Court theme going on in the place.  Yeah, and I walk in there, and Jimmy is online for the bathroom, along with another girl.  Was that the blonde that didn't want to wow us, even though her booze were pretty much out?  That was, that's all I was trying to do was trying to get her out.  Describe her in any way.  It will not match the one description. 
[00:18:00]  She was, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  Her voice was like Mickey Mouse.  It was awful, but her body was hot.  And just Norton trying, begging for a view at her cans.  But you could see him already.  Oh, come on, you could show me that.  Show me, and not under his breath.  Show me, you filthy whore.  Come on, you pig.  She was already topless, pretty much.  I'm like, come on, let me just see.  I mean, who am I going to tell?  I mean, I'm just trying anything I can.  And she'd look away, and he put his finger a millimeter away from our breasts, and go,  look, look, look, look. 
[00:18:30]  And I'm looking, I know, I see.  You don't have to touch them.  I didn't touch them.  No, of course you didn't.  She wouldn't show me, though.  But you were trying.  But I'm saying that bathroom there, if you found a girl, would have been perfect.  You know what?  A ample room.  I almost, yeah, man.  I would love to have brought someone in there.  There's nothing sexier than banging over a toilet.  Yeah.  The ladies seem to like that type of attention.  They hold onto the seat.  They look right down into the abyss.  Ah, sure.  And it's then they get a true measure of their character.  Hating their reflection in the toilet bowl water that they see. 
[00:19:00]  I hate you.  As you're plowing her, I taught you the value of information and how to get it.  I hate you.  I hate you in the toilet bowl water.  All right.  Well, we're just getting started.  Little ripples as the bowl is shaking slightly with every thrust that she'll...  And every teardrop that's falling.  Perfectly round ripples go out and distort her image that she hates looking up. 
[00:19:30]  And if you're really lucky, there's a morning log still in there.  Oh, God.  I'm looking at my reflection, but it looks like I have a big brown spear in my head.  And Jim's packing again just from this conversation.  You're a mess.  All right, Ann, look.  We're just getting started, obviously.  We're calling this the Hangover Show.  We were on stage before Papa Roach, right?  Hell yeah, man.  In front of about 30,000 people.  Wow.  We invited everyone back to the station today for a beer.  I don't think they took you seriously. 
[00:20:00]  Who knows?  We'll see what happens.  We'll see what happens.  But Opie invited, yeah, everybody there.  And when I said, come on to the show tomorrow, they all seemed like they were into it.  Yeah.  And the girls, too, right, for the wow thing.  Yeah, we got the wow thing.  Yes.  Speaking of wow, the wowing at the River Rave yesterday was just beyond ridiculous.  Huge.  All over the place.  Huge.  Huge.  Who was that lovely ebony princess that said she was coming down today?  Oh, I don't know.  Remember her?  Oh, she was in the Naughty Nighty contest, and I guess WBCN lost her photo.  Lost her photo.  We just took those home to jerk it, too. 
[00:20:30]  This girl is so hot.  Yep.  She came to the autograph signing session.  I think she's coming down today.  I didn't make out with her, Rossi, did I?  No.  Oh, okay.  Just want to make sure.  I wish.  Rossi witches.  The girl you made out with was pretty nice.  Was she?  She was real.  Yeah.  Nice long tongue.  You could be seen with a pig or anything.  That tongue was like Gene Simmons long.  It was really long.  That kind of would really be funny to do with just a slob.  Like, if you pointed Rossi out as me to this just pig, and you took the bullet and really 
[00:21:00]  was like, oh, man, I'm so into you.  And then this slob goes and tells her friends that Anthony was really into it.  You could do it.  Kissing her.  That is wrong.  I can see this going very bad in the future.  We'll work on it.  It's a good new gag, though.  She wasn't a slob, though.  Hey, it's fair game for everybody, though.  Hey, real fast, Anthony.  Our WOW contest starts today.  All the girls in the Boston area, please, you know, come on down here. 
[00:21:30]  Anthony got me pregnant.  It would have been even better if it was a guy.  That's really true.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, if you're in the area, you know, come down to WBCN today.  We're here today.  We're leaving right after the show to go back to New York.  Contest is open to listeners 18 and up.  It's the WOW contest, just like all our other Internet contests.  This is going to be huge.  Contestants will submit photos to their respective O&A radio stations.  Is every radio station involved with this? 
[00:22:00]  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  All right, so how do they check?  What do you mean how do they check?  What songs are?  Like, say someone in Columbus wants in on the WOW contest.  Columbus is in.  Columbus is in.  All right, maybe we can get a list of all the stations.  But basically, you go down to the radio station and get your pictures taken like we did with the Naughty Nighty contest.  They're going to send the pictures up to us, and we're going to put it up on, I think, opiananthony.com.  And then grand prize is going to be $5,000 cash provided by risquevideo.com,  your 24-hour adult video novelty and DVD superstore. 
[00:22:30]  That's risque, R-I-S-Q-U-E, video.com.  So this is the first day of the WOW contest, and we're hoping that we get a lot of girls here at WBCN today.  It's 1265 Boylston Street in Boston, okay?  Right.  Let's continue in a minute.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Strokes last night, they had a great set last night at the River Rave.  That's the reason we're broadcasting live from WBCN this afternoon. 
[00:23:00]  The Hangover Show.  It is the Hangover Show.  We invited all our listeners to come on by and hang with us today.  We'll see who shows up.  We get the WOW contest that started today, and I guess a bunch of girls are showing up for that.  Oh, yeah?  $5,000 cash on the line for the best WOW.  Nice.  I think you can go to opieandanthony.com for details, right?  Okay, good.  Did I get in any trouble for making a girl WOW from the stage before Papa Roach?  That was cool.  I was like, you know something?  Opie invites everybody back here tomorrow. 
[00:23:30]  Invites the entire stadium back here.  And then he gives me the mic, and a girl jumps up on a guy's shoulders out of the crowd.  And she's got her bra on.  She takes her shirt off.  I'm like, you know, how am I getting in trouble for this?  But if you're on the guy's shoulders, you might as well just pull him out.  The crowd goes crazy, and she did, and they were nice and worked out well and fine.  But I know some people have a little trouble with that.  They did?  Well, I know they have a little trouble with that thing.  I don't know if they did last night when I did it, but, you know. 
[00:24:00]  You put the pressure on the poor girl.  Yes.  She's on her boyfriend's shoulders, and there's 30,000 people just staring at her.  You've got to go.  You've got to go, I think.  You've got to do it.  You put yourself in that situation.  There's no turning back.  I just know a couple of years back when we, I think the first River Rave we did,  boy, it was in the newspapers and everything about the boobs on the big screens,  and there was nothing else on the big video monitors except bare breasts.  That River Rave we went to, that was, I think, two years ago, right? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  They had a whole crew, and their whole job was just to film girls wowing  and put it on the big screen.  Put it on the screen, and that's all they wrote about in the paper the day after that one.  And since then, I've noticed it's been a little more tamed down,  but you still see the boobage.  Yeah, we saw plenty.  Well, that was a nice touch, though, yesterday.  You really did sort of guilt her into it.  The only thing missing was like a pinball machine or a pool table.  And a bunch of friends that didn't touch her but just didn't do anything, 
[00:25:00]  and that's their guilt.  And the lawyer didn't yell at you?  No.  There was a lawyer on hand.  What the hell was a CBS lawyer doing?  I'm walking down the hall.  What is going on with concerts that you're backstage hanging out and trying to have fun,  and you look up and you feel like your dad's there with you?  It might as well have been.  It's called the O.P. and Anthony show, basically.  I heard they weren't there for us, which was a surprise to Anthony and I.  Although he asked me if I had a check for $21,000 that I could cut for him on the spot. 
[00:25:30]  Bastard.  It's your job.  Make it come away.  I guess they had a problem with another one of these radio station festivals.  Oh, they did.  They wanted to make sure things run a little smoother here in Boston.  What is he going to do, run into a phone booth and turn into super lawyer?  I'll tell you.  I guess he was at the HFS festival down in Washington, and I guess there are still people in the hospital.  Wow, that's a successful event.  Aren't you guys going afternoons there?  That's what I heard.  No, we worked it out.  We worked it out another way.  Sure.  Sorry. 
[00:26:00]  Everything is hunky-dory.  All right.  I don't know what the lawyer was doing there, though.  Like, I'm in the middle of having a lot of fun, drinking, hanging out, watching the bands.  All of a sudden, hey.  Ah.  It's a time to go home, Dad.  You don't see me popping up in a courtroom with a beer in my hand.  What the hell are you doing here?  You're a buzzkill.  Did you meet Steve?  One of the Steves?  Did you meet Steve?  Yeah.  It was just uncomfortable because I know he hates me. 
[00:26:30]  Steve and Steve, radio lawyers.  Ho-ho.  Finds me revolting.  But very funny, he said.  He did say he found you revolting and funny at the same time.  That was nice of him.  What's he going to say?  Hi, I don't enjoy your humor.  He wouldn't do that.  You know what the worst thing is?  They tell you what they liked.  Yeah, I was listening the other day.  You did this bit on that.  Yeah, very funny.  And then they'll point out like 30 reasons why you can never do it again.  Ever, ever, ever.  Thanks.  I'm figuring out a way we can do it.  Yeah, that's your job, right?  Stop your whining.  That's their job.  It is their job. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, we should talk about the hotel because Anthony brought up a very interesting observation.  I got to thank WBCN.  They put us up in the Ritz-Carlton.  They now hold the title.  WBCN holds the title for putting us up in the best hotel the show has ever, ever been in.  Ever, ever.  And I'm checking in and they go, Opie?  I'm like, yeah, how do you know?  And then I look around the lobby.  I'm like, oh, duh.  Who doesn't belong here?  You know?  I know.  It was so uncomfortable. 
[00:27:30]  They're all in like suits and you show up in those awful shorts and your Long Island guy sneakers.  Suits high.  They had all those families in the lobby that you grew up hating.  Those perfect families.  They all had perfect hair and perfect clothes.  And it's like 9 o'clock on a Saturday.  It's like, ugh.  The staff looks like they came off of a chessboard.  They're all dressed in those weird clothes where, what century is that?  It's hot blue hats, blue top hats and coats.  I understand you open my door and get my car for me when I walk out.  But what's with the dress like you just came out of Alice in Wonderland? 
[00:28:00]  You've got the big top hat.  But a great hotel with all the marble and mirror thing and a very luxurious gold elevator.  Beautiful place, the Ritz-Carlton.  No one.  Yeah, they'll never put us up there again, right?  The new one on Avery off Boylston, right?  Yeah.  Wait, they finally ran out of gas in the gag of booking you guys in the same hotel that you were fired from?  Yeah, I guess that gag went away.  Thank God. 
[00:28:30]  And I started, you know, when we first, that was the colonnade they used to put us in.  And when we first started going there, it was cool.  It was fine.  I'm happy as long as I can get in-room movies and 24-hour room service.  Very important.  Because I don't know what the hell time I'm strolling in after making out with listeners and rock shows.  It was just, you know, I don't know what the hell.  Maybe I'm lucky.  Maybe I get lucky.  And, you know, whatever time it might be, I'll stroll into the room.  I want to be able to pick up the menu and eat something.  And then all of a sudden, they cut it off. 
[00:29:00]  They cut off the all-room dining, all-night dining at the colonnade.  And I asked them, like, two months ago or something, the last time we were here, I go, why don't you have that?  He goes, well, September 11th.  Oh, well, that explains everything.  Yeah, yeah, if you had all-night dining, the terrorists would win.  Yeah, they might throw a cheesesteak at the Prudential building.  Hey, good local reference.  Wow, local reference.  I didn't know you were taking notice of the buildings around here.  I guess he meant business was slow, so they kind of stopped that. 
[00:29:30]  But now they put us up at the Ritz-Kong, beautiful, 3.30 in the morning, slicing into a beautiful steak.  Wonderful.  In-room movies, I like this new deal with the movies.  Pause.  Yes.  Fast forward and rewind.  It's about time.  It is 2002.  It's 2002.  I'll sacrifice the flying cars for now.  In my lawsuits.  Give me a movie where I can pause it.  $17, though.  Oh, yeah, very expensive.  $17.  $17 a movie.  Did anyone call home?  I watched four movies. 
[00:30:00]  Two phone calls to Sandy, $80.  Get out of here.  Stop it.  $80.  Why don't you use a calling card?  What's wrong with you?  No, they got to skip.  The hotel's got a scam because they just decided.  What was it, video phone through Mars?  What the hell could take $80?  It was two 15-minute calls.  And you paid it?  What am I going to do?  Reviews.  I never would have paid that.  But these hotels, they got a scam.  They just decide how much they're going to charge.  And they'll see if you argue it?  Well, because like the Colonnade, it's not like that. 
[00:30:30]  Each hotel decides their phone rates.  You get a calling card, dude, a 1-800 calling card.  And they might charge you a buck to dial out.  They still charge you for $800.  A dollar.  But I'm not one-time dollar.  But I'm not thinking.  I expect it's going to be more expensive than usual.  But two calls, $80.  That's ridiculous.  You're crazy.  I know I'm going to get raped.  Even if you make $100 million a year.  I know I'm getting raped.  All that was left in my minibar was like half a bottle of club soda.  Oh, I cleaned it out. 
[00:31:00]  And that's like, forget about it.  You look at your bill and go, I thought BCN was picking this up.  Hey, why do I have to give a...  Is that an incidental?  Because, you know, they pick up the room and the taxes and stuff.  And I had to go to the lady.  I thought they were picking this up because my bill was so ridiculous.  Oh, but that doesn't even include the room.  Oh, they pay for the room.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  And they're like, oh, no.  We didn't charge you for the room or the taxes.  I'm like, okay.  I got a small pot of coffee with two cups and a bagel, $17. 
[00:31:30]  Two cups of coffee and $17 it cost me to take a dump.  Do you know how awful that is?  I was getting room service every night.  Steaks, chicken things that are going on, all the beverages.  I don't even know.  Yeah, you've been out here like a week.  I don't even look at the...  I got in Friday night.  All I know is last week when we were doing the show from New York,  you weren't sitting across from me.  I watched four movies.  Really?  Yeah, my bill's ridiculous.  Ridiculous. 
[00:32:00]  But the pause and the fast forward and the rewind, nice, right?  What a great feature now.  Because you could take the leak.  You don't have to miss the movie.  Or if they say something and you didn't catch the line,  rewind it a little bit.  And you could pause it and then come back later  and start the movie up at the point you paused it.  So I was watching The Count of Monte Cristo,  and I had to leave for a couple hours.  And I come back, boom, right back on again.  Hey, Jim, finally saw A Beautiful Mind.  Did you?  Phenomenal.  Wow, look at that.  A recent movie within the last year.  Relatively speaking.  And I knew Denzel did not deserve Best Actor for Training Day. 
[00:32:30]  Although he got robbed when he did X,  so he should have won for that.  Yeah, I don't think he had Training Day when you look at...  Well, you look at A Beautiful Mind.  And maybe he didn't deserve it for Gladiator, though, so who knows?  I don't know who Russell Crowe beat for Gladiator, but...  Yeah, Russell Crowe beat for Gladiator.  I was so annoyed.  Very good movie.  Oh, it's just well acted.  Yeah, it was great.  That's what I'm talking about.  And I was watching The Count of Monte Cristo, which is a very good movie.  Black Hawk Down, eh, eh.  I thought it was funny when they call them skinnies.  Skinnies on the roof.  Skinnies on the roof.  I like shooting them down in a helicopter.  Wasn't that good, that movie? 
[00:33:00]  It was all right.  Yeah?  It was okay.  Eh, nothing big.  I almost got that.  I'm glad.  Do you know why I didn't get it?  This is true.  Because Keith Robinson, who has got the worst...  He's a black guy with white trash movie taste.  He's the absolute worst.  He told me that Ocean's Eleven was excellent.  Oh, really?  Oh, he's a total ass.  And it's one of the worst films I've ever seen.  It was just horrendous.  And I'm like, you love Black Hawk Down.  I said, dude, it's great.  Yeah, it was...  You know, it's action beginning to end, but it kind of gets like, all right, we're still in the action.  Give me something else.  And then Heart's War, which is that goddamn Bruce Willis POW camp thing. 
[00:33:30]  They wrote me in because I'm thinking, all right, this is going to be like The Great Escape.  It's going to be like a bunch of guys in a Nazi POW camp trying to escape.  Joking and digging tunnels.  Digging tunnels, joking, laughing, shooting some Nazis, joking them in the night or something.  It turns out to be a courtroom drama.  It was a goddamn courtroom drama.  They wrote me in.  And I'm like, you don't waste a good set like this and good special effects of explosions and planes on a World War II courtroom drama. 
[00:34:00]  Sucked.  There were some awful films made because there was an impending sack strike coming.  Everyone thought the actors were going.  So they were just making film, film, film, just making movies to get a few in the can.  17 bucks a pop, those movies.  I agree.  It stinks.  I was going to watch the De Niro-Eddie Murphy movie just to hate it, but I couldn't make myself do it.  I thought that was pretty bad.  A little too steep for you now to pay to watch something you might not want to watch.  Well, I knew I only had time for one, so let me watch a good one.  What was it?  Did you spank any of the spank of it? 
[00:34:30]  Did George Clooney?  No, the spank of it stinks.  Come on.  It's all soft core drivel.  You know how far gone?  That was cool when I was 15.  Yeah.  I'm 18 years beyond that.  You're light years past that.  But remember when that used to satisfy?  Dude, stir crazy.  There's a script scene in stir crazy where the go-go dancers are dancing and they show they're wearing thongs and they do like an ass shake.  And I would time it right where I would just get ready, get ready, get ready, and the ass shake.  Honestly, God, I remember my dad would try to come in the living room and watch TV because we had cable. 
[00:35:00]  And I knew the scene was coming.  I'm like, get out of here.  Get out of here.  So I would put on MTV to annoy him.  And he's like, I'm going to go to bed.  And he would go to bed and then right back and time it.  And look at you.  That is hysterical.  Stuff like that used to satisfy, right?  Well, beyond that, yeah, then you start moving into, well, you're a prostitute here.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, it's popcorn tasting.  Yeah, you move way beyond the softcore SpectraVision nonsense.  The SpectraVision, back in the ancient times when they used to have a cable service called Cinema 100. 
[00:35:30]  Cinema 100.  You got no more channels.  It wasn't anything.  There was a box that sat on your TV with a huge switch and a key.  Clank, clank, clank.  And a key.  It was like NORAD.  Yeah.  You turn the goddamn key, flip the switch, and on Saturday nights, after midnight, you  got softcore porno movies.  Was it in your own home?  Electric blue.  Electric blue.  No, this was even something different.  It was just Cinema 100.  So you'd watch this stuff and they had movies like Fairy Tales. 
[00:36:00]  It was called where it was this whole fairy tale.  Oh, my God.  I totally remember that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a genre movie.  But it was, you know, you'd see cans and ass and an occasional quickly walking by bush shot.  Yeah, other ones, they'd show the last tango in Paris.  Things like, get the butter.  Get the butter.  They'd show stuff like that.  But like Jim said, you'd have to know the part that was coming up because they'd show them  back to back for eight hours straight.  And you'd know the part that was coming up and have to work it. 
[00:36:30]  And then at the prime moment, you'd finish up because a lot of the times you couldn't  finish up because the second you see something nice and you really go to town and you're  ready to finish, there's the guy's face going, oh, oh, oh, big veiny neck and whiskers  and just the top of the girl's back.  You're like, great.  I just finished to a guy.  Go ahead, guys.  The old, I used to love the old on Cinemax, the old Emanuel films.  There was Black Emanuel, Goodbye Emanuel, Emanuel in Bangkok with Laura Gemser. 
[00:37:00]  They were sexy films.  Yeah.  You get beyond that as you become more of a sexual act.  Remember a movie called Cheerleaders?  No, no.  It was called Cheerleaders.  It was one of those softcore pornos and it was the football team and the cheerleaders going  around and just effing everybody.  And then the cheerleaders decided they're going to eff the other team to wear them out.  And the eff scenes were hysterical.  And you just see these huge, big 70s earthbomb of moths on these cheerleaders. 
[00:37:30]  Hi.  We're cheerleaders.  Ah.  What the hell is it?  You put your pom-poms in your lap.  Horrid.  I like seduction, though, man.  I didn't like just the straight F scenes.  I liked, like, lesbian seduction was my favorite thing.  I got to the point where, like you said, you move on and things aren't as effective anymore.  When you think about it, a goddamn Sears catalog used to work.  You know, when you see the panty ads and things like that.  And then you move on and on and on.  I got to the point where, as far as porno goes, I don't want a story.  I don't want characters.  I don't want comedy.  I don't want drama. 
[00:38:00]  I want, I need something to get effed within a minute into turning that movie on.  I'm just the opposite.  I have to have story.  A little storyline, right?  I have to because you can't believe it.  It's like, I can't believe he's doing that with her.  Well, I don't care.  If the chick is hot and she's going to town and she's talented and a lot of action, I don't care how she got there, what she's doing there, who the guy is.  Why do I care?  I just want to see a big hog just slamming in.  That's it.  Plot, never good.  Plot, never good. 
[00:38:30]  You don't care about their life in real life.  You don't want to see enough film.  I like plot.  I need a little story.  I like plot.  Just a little.  Hate it.  A little set up.  Only because it's just, it's like, it puts, when I'm whacking my bag, I have to somehow believe that I could be in that situation.  Like when I would, you see.  You've got sick and disturbing and you have a problem.  No, but when I would fantasize.  Take it for what it is.  It is visual stimulation.  Even when I was fantasizing, like in high school, I somehow had to make it a believable fantasy with the girl. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Like it couldn't just be she walks into the classroom and ooh, waka waka.  It would just, all right.  It needed to have like, we're walking home, she had to be looking at her ass.  It had to be realistic for me to dump.  Turns out I go, Jimmy, are you looking at me?  No, I'm not.  Well, come here, sniff.  You needed a whole storyline.  I have to have a storyline.  Yeah, I have to.  And it had to be believable.  But fantasies are one thing.  I can understand that.  When you're watching a movie, as long as the visual is there, I could give a crap about storyline. 
[00:39:30]  It pisses me off when something's going on and all of a sudden, ding dong.  Ooh, put the clothes back up.  Like, ah, fast forward.  Don't care.  Don't care.  Don't care.  All right.  The slug's back out.  He's slamming her.  Back to play.  See, you know how bad this would be if you and me checked into a hotel to help each other out a little?  We'd be fighting over what's going to get.  Fighting over the remotes.  Maybe hurt each other or tugging too hard on one part.  Come on, slow down.  I need storyline.  All right, look, we've got a break.  We've got a break.  I never even got to talk about the hotel, the reason I was bringing it up.  And trust me, you don't want to go anywhere. 
[00:40:00]  It's disgusting.  Anthony went to a men's locker room.  I went to the gym.  He went through a men's locker room.  Went to the pool in the hotel.  And he has some observations.  Yeah, my opinions of men's locker rooms.  I'll save you.  He was not happy that he had to walk through this men's locker room.  No, no.  But there was plenty of storyline in there, Jim.  So we'll talk about that right after break.  Also, we've got to talk about Ben calling everyone completely hammered, hanging out with the Patriots.  Yeah, we're doing a Super Bowl ring party. 
[00:40:30]  Ben's the latest teammate.  It was hilarious.  He's the latest pick.  He called us three or four times when we were driving back to Boston from the River Rafe.  And then Jim's got some observations on this big dig thing.  Oh, I sat in that too.  Yeah.  Oh, you know, it's only 12.30, 1 o'clock on Sunday night.  You've got to expect traffic.  Also, Ann, really fast, the WOW Contest.  It starts today.  It's going to go on for a few weeks when the girls come down and they qualify.  You've got to get your shots in. 
[00:41:00]  These are the stations that are helping us out with the WOW Contest.  New York, of course, Philly, Boston, Cleveland, Buffalo, Washington, Chicago, Columbus, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Francisco, Dallas, and Vegas.  If we mentioned your city right there, all you have to do is show up at the station.  They'll take your pictures and they'll send them up to us and eventually the listeners are going to vote for the best WOW, Anthony.  This is a huge, huge contest, even bigger than the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Cold Heart Cash.  Cold Heart Cash.  $5,000 up for grabs. 
[00:41:30]  You've got to be 18 or older.  The cash provided by RiskayVideo.com, your 24-hour adult video novelty and DVD superstore.  That's Riskay, R-I-S-K-U-E, Video.com.  Good stories on those videos.  RiskayVideo.com.  Many good stories.  Good drama and comedy.  I don't like comedy.  Comedy and porn never work.  No, we talked about that.  Ever.  The silly porn never works.  With the stupid music.  And the guy comes out of the pizza truck and, oh, he looks so goofy. 
[00:42:00]  He starts hammering the girl.  Yeah, it does nothing for me.  Look, I'm laughing and jerking it.  I don't even want to smirk when I'm ready to thump.  I don't even want my lips to curl up a little bit.  The only thing funny should be the face I'm making.  Exactly.  Or as soon as I dump, if the guy kills her on film.  Then you have a laugh.  Hey, any girls show up for this wow thing yet?  Yeah, now they'll be running in the droves.  Sorry.  This conversation.  Well, Psycho Tim, he's bringing some professionals down. 
[00:42:30]  Ah.  Well, speaking of traffic, they just called us stuck in the Callahan Tunnel right now.  Great.  They're about an hour out there from Shamrock Entertainment.  How many Irish names in one sentence?  The Callahan Tunnel from the Shamrock Entertainment.  I was trying to explain Salvee to Jim Norton last night on the way home.  I've got to take him down there.  It's great.  And how brutal they are in that.  We spent St. Paddy's Day in Salvee once being open.  It was pretty scary.  And I'm white.  It's fun.  You drink a few beers.  You wire a few car bombs. 
[00:43:00]  It's fun.  You beat your brother up.  I love it up here.  They're just angry white people.  They're great.  It's true.  Well, they have pubs called the Teamsters Pub.  You know, you're in trouble walking to that place.  Great.  Oh, yeah.  Union pubs.  Yeah, Psycho Tim's bringing some girls by.  Hopefully, all the ladies will show up.  We're at WBCN today.  1265 Boylston Street.  If you want to do the wow thing today for us.  Okay?  Roy!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-WNEW.  POD Live.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:43:30]  Another band that just rocked yesterday at the River Rave, Anthony.  Yeah.  This is our hangover show.  We went to the River Rave.  It was like 12 hours of just fun, debauchery.  Got home very late.  Yeah, we got home late.  We have a band, never-ending search for beer.  That goes on at the River Rave for some reason.  Weren't we laughing?  We're like, every year?  Every year?  The beer?  The lack of beer?  You walk into one place and you look at the cooler that had beer in it. 
[00:44:00]  And it's just empty.  And you're like, oh, no.  There's no beer left in here.  And then you're on a search.  Other radio stations don't drink like you guys do.  Well, that's the problem.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I don't know where Ben gets the energy.  Because we were there for like 12 straight hours.  And then he's like, dude, I'm off to some Super Bowl ring ceremony.  It was the Patriots ring ceremony, yeah.  And he wanted all of us to go.  But we all bailed.  Give him their Super Bowl rings last night.  But Ben's just calling everybody all excited all night long. 
[00:44:30]  Just completely hammered.  Saying, I'm standing next to him.  At one point we asked you if you were standing next to Drew Bledsoe.  And you said he's not even there or something.  Well, no.  You want to know what?  You're such a dick.  You set me up.  You go, hey, it's Drew Bledsoe there.  I'm standing right next to William McGinnis.  I go, Drew Bledsoe.  And I go, William McGinnis goes, yo, man, why are you talking about Drew Bledsoe?  We were there.  Tim was with me.  We were like, there was only a few people that weren't a New England Patriots at this thing.  It was really cool.  It was sweet.  Yeah.  And I heard you got to try on a ring.  The coolest thing was trying on the ring.  As I was coming out of the bathroom, two of the bats were in there. 
[00:45:00]  And I'm like, holy cow, the ring.  The guy goes, just wash your hands off.  Put it on.  I'm sweet.  Just wash your hands, really.  If you're in the bathroom, he doesn't want your schlong.  I hear those rings are so big, you could wear them as C-rings.  $15,000 a pop.  You can't say that.  Oh, you can't?  No, you can't say that.  Oh, boy.  Sweater boy is really happy.  He gets to hit the dump button.  You can't say it like that.  We're responsible broadcasters.  I don't think that's that bad.  Jimmy's learning every day.  We've lost about $21,000, but we're learning every day. 
[00:45:30]  Pony up.  None of those had anything to do with a little Jimmy.  Oh, for the record, Jimmy, I really want to go because you want to get more photos.  That's all you're talking about.  Dude, I can get photos with the packs.  Yeah, why not?  Come on, let's go.  But we were stuck in that big, big traffic, and we didn't know if we had passed the exit.  We weren't getting off in Roxbury.  Yeah, I was explaining how they segregate their people up here.  Yeah, they certainly do.  I swear to God.  Errol, it's the truth, though.  I'm like, all right, that's Roxbury. 
[00:46:00]  There's, you know, mostly black over there.  Southies over there, all white, not even one black there.  All white Irish.  Yeah, the Italians in the North End and the Jews in Snowden, better known as Newton.  B-b-b-boy.  All segregated.  B-boy.  Because we were trying to get off, ah, whatever, it's too local for everybody else.  But we were stuck in the big, big traffic.  It was midnight on a Sunday, and you're in traffic.  For no reason.  And we left a little early to beat the crowd out of the stadium parking lot. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, and then you find yourself in that crap at midnight on a Sunday.  Jim goes, I don't even know what the big dig is, and I hate it.  I was so aggravated.  It stinks.  Because you could see around the corner, and just all red brake lights and taillights, and  nobody was moving.  That's the worst, when you come around the corner or over the hill, and you go, all right,  maybe it starts moving.  Oh, no.  It goes as far as I can see.  It was awful.  Jim, you haven't spent a lot of time up here.  You've got to explain Boston traffic to Anthony. 
[00:47:00]  What?  He just was losing his effing mind.  He doesn't get it, because it's just, it's unlike any other city, the traffic up here,  and how people drive.  He drove with me here today, by the way.  I think he completely understands my take on the whole thing.  Yeah, I did.  Every time I've driven with him, he's gotten lost.  It's horrible.  It's either he's retarded or I'm bad luck.  You know why?  It's not like this is the first time we've done a show from BCA, man.  The first time, I'll let you know, the first time was in D.C., and it's that goddamn  Beltway, and I was completely assed with that. 
[00:47:30]  You went all the way around.  I went all the way around.  I'm heading north again.  I'm like, wow.  Listen to all the D.C. people listening to you, laughing at you right now.  Anthony went all the way around.  I was going from Philly.  No one goes all the way around.  I was going from Philly to D.C., and I'm on 95, and then I noticed I'm on 95, I'm heading  north again.  I'm like, wait a minute.  D.C. has the only road in America, it says south, but you're really going north.  Yeah.  You go around.  It's the Belt. 
[00:48:00]  It goes all the way around.  But they don't feel like they need to change the signs.  No.  You're still going south, even though you passed the point of going south, and now you're  going north again.  They should have a big sign that says that.  You passed the point of going south.  You are heading north now again on the Beltway.  It's one big-ass loop, and if you don't know what you're doing, you're F.  They don't put that sign there.  No.  And you've said we've been coming here for a while.  We've done nine or ten shows from the studio now.  We never stayed at the Ritz-Carlton.  Dude.  From the colonnade, I could get here in a snap.  You could see Fenway Park from any point. 
[00:48:30]  Don't even start about what you can see in Boston and how you get there, because that  ain't going to wash with me, my friend.  All you have to do is make a left turn, because now I'm heading toward what I see, and it flips  you around and puts you on Starro Drive heading the other way.  Stop it.  I spent a bunch of time...  So you saw Fenway.  You just didn't know how to get there.  Dude, I spent time taking Beacon down, right?  Right.  I make one wrong move because I can't go the way I want to make.  I'm on Starro Drive right back where I started. 
[00:49:00]  Right back where I started.  And you jumped the curb, right?  Yeah.  How cool is it when he gets pissed off when he's driving?  You know there's a curb getting jumped when you hear you stupid CF, and then he just  jumps up on the curb and spins around.  It was great.  The string of curses that come out of my mouth, and it was a big curb and a median all  in between, and then it dropped down into another lane.  I just turned the wheels, boom, boom, boom, boom, up on the median.  Have you ever been driving with Anthony when people actually jump out of the way?  They have to, because they're on sidewalks. 
[00:49:30]  It'll happen eventually, because he does drive on sidewalks when he gets really...  I've driven on the sidewalks, I've driven on the median strip, and he starts screaming  and beeping at someone, get the F out of my way, like they're the problem now.  Well, they are at that point, because I'm driving on a place that you're not supposed  to be driving, so if anyone else is on there, they're in the wrong.  And I mean that.  I had to get to the airport once.  I had to get to Kennedy Airport once, taking the Bell Parkway out in Queens, and it was  backed up.  A lot of traffic.  Took the median almost the whole way there. 
[00:50:00]  But there were huge drainage dishes in it, so it's like a scene out of Bullet, my car  was flying into the air, and at that point, I'm just like, if a cop pulls me over, I'll  really give him the sob story, and maybe he'll help me out, or I get arrested.  Either I make it or I don't.  That's my whole take on driving anywhere.  I gotta get there quickly.  And when I get pissed, like you saw today, Norton, I do things.  I make things happen.  I was just giggling in the backseat, happy.  But he doesn't do it out loud, because he knows I'm just like, oh yeah, my breakings. 
[00:50:30]  Enjoy it.  It is really funny to see Anthony lose his effing mind, but you don't want to vocalize  that ever.  There's no rhyme or reason to the roads here in Boston.  None.  There's no rhyme or reason.  If you're in Manhattan, right, and you're at 9th and 57th, and you gotta get to 2nd and  35th, you know how to get there.  It's a grid system.  It's wonderful.  The streets go down.  The avenues go up and down here. 
[00:51:00]  You know exactly what you gotta do.  Here?  Oh, alright.  There's Fenway.  I see it.  There's a major highway in my way that seems impassable.  It seems that they have put this highway in there with no way to pass it.  You gotta explain that to other cities.  Yeah, Mass Ave, they only have literally two exits.  Yeah.  And then there's a trench.  You're 10 miles out, you're on the Mass Pike.  Mass Pike, I'm sorry.  And there's not enough exits to get off the damn highway. 
[00:51:30]  No, not at all.  And you know, just because if you're heading west to east on the Mass Pike, don't be silly  and think the same exits are gonna be there if you're going the other way.  Don't hop on thinking, alright, if I'm heading west on the Mass Pike, I can then just hop off  at Copley Square exit.  It ain't there.  There isn't one.  Why?  I don't know.  They decided they didn't need one for people that might want to take that as a way to bypass 93. 
[00:52:00]  Talk about some local references.  Holy Jesus.  I know.  Alright.  But that's why I get angry.  And like Jim said, Das FC face mother FC.  That's great.  Yeah, and he's giggling.  He strings curses together like no one else.  Like no one else.  His combinations are unbelievable.  And I lost my cell phone.  So now I gotta get another cell phone.  What'd you call it?  It's off dead, like done. 
[00:52:30]  They won't answer.  It's me.  Hi.  Leave a message.  Ask, where's my phone?  I don't know.  You lost it, Dick.  Maybe it's in the locker room of the hotel.  Let's get back to that.  Anthony, actually, you decide to work out at the hotel?  No, stop.  Don't be silly.  Don't be silly.  They have a great facility there at the Ritz-Carlton.  But no, I went to the pool.  They have like an Olympic pool there.  The lanes and everything.  I'm gonna do some laps.  You know what I mean? 
[00:53:00]  I'm doing some laps.  At least I can't get lost.  It's a straight line.  I'm doing laps, Sophie.  Yeah.  A little backstroke, a little butterfly, doggy paddle, whatever works.  Are you talking about swimming or the gay pride parade?  Yeah, we'll talk about that, too.  No, I just have a problem with men's locker rooms.  Men's locker rooms.  For some reason, I had to go through this great workout facility, and you gotta give him your room key card, and he gives you a card, then you give the card to the guy, and he gives you a key to the locker room. 
[00:53:30]  It's like this big protocol thing.  And then you have to walk through the men's locker room to get to the pool area.  No other way to get there.  You must walk through the men's locker room.  I hate the smell of men's locker rooms.  It's feet and ass.  It's disgusting.  I would never be in a men's locker room, ever, if it wasn't the only way to go to the pool.  And then there's this phenomenon that just happens every time. 
[00:54:00]  Guys, for some reason, feel they have to be completely naked because they can be in the locker room.  There's plenty of towels.  If you want to shower because you've got to do something, fine.  There's a shower area.  I'm not going to go gawking at the showers.  I know there's nude men there.  That's where I don't look.  You just hang up your little towel as you're taking your shower.  There's not much.  Right.  There's not much.  You're bathing.  You get done.  There's plenty of towels.  As a matter of fact, they're all over the place. 
[00:54:30]  You put one around you.  You wipe off whatever you've got to do.  Basically, no need to walk around the whole locker room.  There is no need if I am walking through the locker room to get from the point where I've got to give the guy the key to the pool itself that I should see or have to see naked men.  They're walking around the, like you get your little lockers sectioned off and stuff, and they're in there.  They're walking between lockers just with a towel in his hand.  Ha, ha, ha, his feet just out. 
[00:55:00]  Big, hairy, bird nest mess.  And even if you're not looking directly at it, your peripherals still see this big mess.  You know it's there.  You know it's there.  And it's not, it's not proper.  You don't look at the sun, but you know it's there.  It's not right, and it is, I will say, any guy, and call me out on this if you want, because you're going to have a hard time explaining this to me.  Any guy, any guy that walks around the locker room of any gym for any purpose is gay. 
[00:55:30]  Is gay.  If you take a shower, and you're naked in the shower, and then you put the towel on around you, you towel off, and you're by your locker, and you take the towel, and now you put your pants on, that's fine.  It's part of the game there.  But if you're walking up and down the aisles, or walking from the shower to your locker, and your junk is just dripping on the carpet, and you're holding your towel, and there's guys that are just trying to get to the pool, there's no need for me to have every sense just raped. 
[00:56:00]  I'm smelling man-ass.  I'm seeing crotch.  I'm in an environment I don't like.  So, any guy that does this is gay, because if there was a one billionth percent of a chance that there'd be a chick that might see you naked, you've got an argument.  I'll even give you that.  Here's the one place, the one place that guaranteed you won't see a girl. 
[00:56:30]  No, you're walking around naked in a place where absolutely, absolutely there won't be a girl, yet you feel compelled to stroll around nude.  Maybe that's the reason they do it.  Why?  Just because they feel comfortable.  I don't know.  Gay.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Gay, gay, gay.  I'm trying to play the other side, but you're right.  Any guy.  Rick is holding up a sign.  It's called cruising.  Rick. 
[00:57:00]  Is that called cruising?  These are the guys that...  Hold on, hold on, Rick.  Hold on, Rick.  Cruising.  Hold on, Rick, who works out at the Chelsea gym.  Do you?  Do you, Rick?  You're living downtown now.  That must be fun trying to find a gym for you.  Well, no.  I fell off.  I run into the same stuff all the time.  Yeah.  And it's a constant garage.  Guys, ever pissed that you're naked?  No?  All right.  Okay. 
[00:57:30]  All right, you got me.  No, it's just, it's just, it's, but it doesn't even matter where it's at.  No matter what gym you're at, there's always guys doing it, and they're always like these  big, fat old men who decide they're going to pop their leg up, and then they're like,  you know, then you catch them by the hand blowers.  Like, I don't even look.  It's just peripheral.  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's like, all right, that's a sink.  That's a hand blower.  This guy is standing by the hand blower, just blowing his sack.  Trying to dry off.  Yeah, he's got the thing pointed down there, and he's just standing there like this.  Well, but you worked out at an unusual gym, bro. 
[00:58:00]  And that was on Long Island, dude.  Oh, all right.  That's not even in the city.  Fire Island, Long Island?  Yeah.  Where you spent last week?  Rick, you do work out at a gay gym, do you?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not proud of it.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  It's the gym that's closest to his place, bro.  It is bad.  He has told some stories, bro.  Dude.  They must love you.  Oh, my God.  He must slut him.  I don't stick around long enough.  Rick is chum.  Chum.  No, I don't hang around long enough. 
[00:58:30]  It's throw the bag in the locker, I'm out.  Rick goes in the water.  Gays come cruising.  Our gays.  Dude, it's not water.  They don't seem to be living till they AF you.  Drink to your foreskin.  Eyes roll back white, lifeless eyes, like a homo's eyes.  Wow, that must be brutal for you.  It's especially brutal when you see people that look like they could be any normal guy,  like, you know, aunt, I mean, uncle or whatever. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  And he walks up and he starts rubbing the stomach of another guy who's doing crunching.  And the guy is you.  No, not me.  No, wrong.  I'm not gay.  Boy, that is something.  So there must be a lot of what they call cruising.  Yes.  Around in that area.  That's just like a smorgasbord.  And the worst part, though, is...  Do you shower in that locker room?  Nah, nah, nah.  I'm trying.  Nah.  Now?  It's sweats on, throw the bag in there, lock it up, and I'm out. 
[00:59:30]  There's got to be something that could be done, because I'm convinced that that smell,  that smell, that locker room smell, smells like homosexuals.  It has to come from men walking around nude.  That's where the smell comes from.  It's like you're breathing in ass.  That's a great observation, though.  It's horrid.  Brilliant.  All men walk around locker room naked gay.  Gay.  All.  End of story.  No exceptions ever, ever. 
[01:00:00]  Thank you.  All right, Ed.  Up to the gay parade break, right?  Well, I guess that's really quick.  We all were driving in town, and I guess Saturday they had the gay pride parade up here in Boston.  And we didn't know.  We're just driving up Boylston.  And I go to Jim.  I go, wow, Jim, check out those two chicks making out.  That was really, really happy.  Boston rules.  And then you go another block, and it was just all over.  All over, Johnny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I heard them.  They had a concert in the park and everything, and it was all, like, lesbian, angry, lesbian music 
[01:00:30]  coming through the window.  Wasn't Sophie B. Hawkins playing?  Sophie B. Hawkins was playing.  And I'm laughing because I thought it was just, like, some cover bands or something.  What, they couldn't get the Indigo Girls?  Yeah.  I thought it was cover bands playing and stuff.  So I'm just mocking how she sounds.  I'm like, oh, she can't even sing this song right.  And it was like, oh, this band sucks.  And then they introduce her, and I hear her name.  I'm like, oh, man, it was a girl.  What do I know?  I stink.  Did you have a good seat at the show? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  It was wonderful.  I walked around naked the whole park with the towel in my hand.  It's good.  The whole park smelled like ass.  It was fantastic.  No.  I just shut the windows.  I was like, I watch a movie.  What you're hearing out there is, ooh.  We were taking a cab and just working that one cab driver going, yeah, all the faggots  are in town today.  Oh, were you trying to get them to talk?  Oh, yeah.  We were just being idiots.  Yeah, that's pretty funny when you do that.  We were being idiots.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, a lot of the fags out today, huh?  And then you wait for them to feel you out and think that it's cool. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  I don't like these goddamn faggots.  Almost in the pack.  Any girls here for the wow contest?  Any?  Any?  Any?  Not yet.  Tim?  Psycho Tim, where are your girls?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Traffic.  Oh, boy.  Trust me.  Oh, boy.  I'm going through the Callahan Tunnel.  We might have to call you Dustin Diamond.  Hopefully, we got a shamrock with him.  We might have to call you the showstopper.  Oh.  He promised us four hot girls to get this wow contest going at. 
[01:02:00]  Goddamn screech.  Man, I'm still reading email on that one.  What a disaster that was for Friday.  It was fun, though.  It was so bad.  It was fun.  I think people will enjoy seeing us take it in the face every once in a while.  Just eat crap.  A type of fun we'll ever invite him back for, Opie?  No.  Of course not.  No.  No.  Okay.  The wow contest is on it.  It starts today.  Game on.  The girls are going to have a few weeks to qualify. 
[01:02:30]  All you have to do is go down to the stations that are participating in this.  We just learned that Cleveland is having a little problem with the wow contest.  Uh-oh.  No, the radio station, I mean, is beyond cool, but I guess there's a new policy at that station  that they can't have nudity in that building anymore.  No nudity.  So they're trying to find another area they can take the pictures of the girls.  What's wrong with nudity?  Well, who owns the building that's saying that?  It's not the radio station.  No, I know.  What douchebag owns the building?  They're obviously in some kind of corporate office park or something. 
[01:03:00]  So you get a nudity in the station itself, even though it's...  No.  So they're going to try to find somewhere else to do it.  No, that's not it.  They were horrified of the last contest.  People were horrified of the contestants walking in and the hijinks.  Hijinks and shenanigans and mirth.  Who was it?  The corporate owners who want to F people out of their life savings but don't show cans?  It's just scumbags.  God, everyone's Enron, dude.  Yeah, most of them are.  Anyone who has a problem with, you know, female nudity. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  So these are the cities that are in on the WOW Contest.  New York, Philly, Boston, Cleveland, Buffalo, D.C., Chicago, Columbus, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Francisco, Dallas, Las Vegas.  God, we're on a lot of radio stations, huh?  Nice.  If we named your city or town there, you'd just show up at the station and get your WOW pictures done.  All right.  Eventually, our listeners will vote for the best WOW, and one lucky lady's walking away with $5,000, courtesy of Risque Video, R-I-S-Q-U, video.com. 
[01:04:00]  They've got a website, RisqueVideo.com.  They're supplying the $5,000 cash.  Mm.  What?  My fat, naked gym guy bit?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll play this, and we'll be back.  Uh, Maria.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Um, she was on the show, the f***ing show, like, about...  Oh, okay.  Look, look, look.  Just everybody...  Someone hit the wrong button. 
[01:04:30]  I'll try.  Are you still hungover?  Are you all right, Ben?  It's all awesome.  It was back to the future here.  Is that heavy Super Bowl ring on your finger?  I said it earlier, man.  He looks like the dude from Back to the Future.  He gets all freaked out, and you sweat so much, and he puts...  When Ben sweats, he puts his hands through his hair in a way that almost gives him a mohawk,  but the sides also stick out.  And it makes it look like he's stressing even more than he usually does, and...  We have to get to DeLorean up to 88 miles an hour.  And he has the herky-jurky. 
[01:05:00]  I had the wrong track, dude.  We'll go back to the future and find more beer.  I'll find the real track.  Those Philip Seymour Hoffman mutton chops.  I screwed up.  I hit the wrong track.  It's a tough day for us all, Ben.  Yeah, it's called The Hangover Show.  With Opie and Anthony.  Hit it.  Now presenting Real American A-Hole.  Real American A-Hole.  Today we flip off you, Mr. Really Fat Walk Around the Locker Room Talk to Everybody Naked Guy. 
[01:05:30]  Mr. Really Fat Walk Around the Locker Room Talk to Everybody Naked Guy.  You've seen him.  He sweats just from breathing.  Then he proceeds to have total conversations with anybody who'll listen,  standing there buck-ass naked.  That's not cool, man.  No real man wants to see another man naked.  Least of all, someone like you,  who looks like they're wearing fuzzy underwear  and just swallowed a kid's hippity-hop toy.  Oh!  And you seem to think that this type of behavior is okay for straight men. 
[01:06:00]  But I've got news for you.  It's not.  You're not sexy.  You've got a towel.  Now use it.  Cover that ass crack.  And next time, do us all a favor.  Shut your mouth.  Get dressed.  How about a crunch or two, fat boy?  Mr. Really Fat Walk Around the Locker Room Talk to Everybody Naked Guy.  Some 41, Fat Lip, another band that played the River Rave yesterday at the beautiful CMGI Field, Anthony. 
[01:06:30]  What a time.  The brand new stadium that the Patriots will be using.  What a time.  Was had by all.  From now on.  And Some 41 definitely rocked.  It's the day after.  This is the hangover show.  We spent the whole day rocking and rolling and acting like we were 17 again.  At least we didn't have any problems with the police.  You know, we were fine.  I saw a couple people had a lot of fun.  I'll just say.  People are stupid because all the cops I saw, they were very tolerant. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, they were allowing a lot of things to go on.  You have to be really uncool to get in trouble.  It amounted to people.  How is a cop that I saw walking by holding a pipe and holding the hands of a kid, you know, his hands behind his back, walking, going,  how do you not look around and see who's watching you before you spark up?  You got to, you know, he's the guy that's like, dude, look at me.  Dude, I'm smoking a bowl, man.  There's a cop like two feet.  F you, man. 
[01:07:30]  You want to get high.  It doesn't have to be a spectacle.  You just go and you get high.  It's not too hard to do.  These guys, yeah, it's not hard to do.  You got to really have this up because I don't think there were any undercover cops there.  No, it was all I saw were uniformed guys and the guys in security that were bringing some people in that were smoking, I guess.  They should have been smoking or I don't know what it was.  Even the people that were moshing and being thrown over the rail, they were just being told,  all right, run back and get back in the crowd.  It wasn't a big problem.  You really had to be a dick to get in trouble yesterday. 
[01:08:00]  And I saw a few, man.  I was standing in the back.  Saw a guy just beat to hell.  Big, bloody eye.  Almost looked like Tyson after the Tyson fight.  Very badly beat.  Which we'll be talking about soon.  And cops with him.  And the guy dropped something.  I guess what he was is somebody who wanted to file a complaint with the cop.  He didn't seem to be in trouble, but he dropped something and the cop is still walking.  He goes, oh, wait a minute.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Then goes to bend over to pick it up and falls. 
[01:08:30]  And the cop, all I see is looks at him and he goes, so how much you have to drink today?  He's like, gone.  Gone.  Another guy that probably had a little too much to drink, said something he shouldn't have said,  grabbed someone he shouldn't have grabbed, and got in a fight.  You've got to be an idiot to really get in trouble with these things.  But there was a parade of people sometimes.  There were times where, you know, in a five-minute clip, I'd see three or four people being pulled out  because they were being stupid. 
[01:09:00]  Entertaining for me.  Very nice.  And we've got to move on to the Lady Di thing.  Yeah, what is going on now?  Well, we're going to find out.  You know the deal.  Anthony came up with a great idea.  We have a lot of these hanger-ons, and it's time to thin the herd.  Thin the herd.  We want to try to get rid of at least three of them by the end of the summer.  Yeah, the whole Patty thing started the ball rolling, and we realized, look, some of these people  are just taking the place of maybe somebody else that would be involved in the show  and really give us some great entertainment.  But we haven't been able to bring new people in because we have so much dead wood around. 
[01:09:30]  So Lady Di, we noticed, isn't as talented, as funny, as charismatic as Marion, her friend.  They've been together, you know, like the retarded Siamese twins since they were kids.  They came in together.  They always come in together.  Yet Marion has that spark.  That's something that we want for the show.  When Lady Di has nothing, and she is a waste.  Now, what someone has to do on one of our websites, because you just nailed it, 
[01:10:00]  you know those Siamese twins where the one wheels her sister around and she's the country singer?  The country singer, and they're connected by the face and head.  Tell me they don't look like Lady Di and Marion.  Someone's got to do a split screen.  Oh, mold them together, yeah.  Someone has got to do a split screen.  My sister's a country western singer.  She wants to sing country western.  Yeah, I'm sure that people really concentrate on the words.  Yeah, that's why they're...  That horrific mess that is there.  Yeah, that's why they're there to see you sing country western.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't even know they were connected at the face. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  She has a nice voice and another person growing out of her skull.  Just be what you are.  Stop thinking people are accepting you.  They're not ugly.  Big dopey two cowboy hats sewn together thing.  The best part of those two girls, the one likes her hair short and dyed and the other  one likes it long.  So I guess some hairdresser somewhere has to decide where the one girl's hair ends and  where her head ends and the other girl's hair begins.  You know what it looks like?  If you've ever been...  I'm sure there are plenty of cities and suburbs of cities that have neighborhoods like this, 
[01:11:00]  but Queens, New York, they have these two family homes and there are two front doors in the  front.  The left side of this building is one family.  The right side is a completely different family.  You own these things.  They're yours.  So you can paint them or panel them any way you please.  So if right family on the right side decides they want to do aluminum siding, they only do  it on their side.  Yeah.  It's the same building.  Yeah.  And then left side guy wants a brick face.  So it's this ridiculous line.  It does look ridiculous.  With half of it one way, half the other way. 
[01:11:30]  Her head is like she wants to be a blonde, but the other one wants to be a redhead.  So they what?  Did you get a carpenter and snap a line between their head, find the dividing mark, and die  accordingly?  Yeah.  And what?  As I'm thinking, I realize how silly I sound.  What?  And that looks ridiculous?  Yeah.  As opposed to just having a plain woman with the same color hair growing out of your face?  It looks more ridiculous.  But Marion and Lady Di look like those twins.  Yeah.  Someone's got to have, someone has to do a split screen somewhere.  So what they should do when she's singing country with a little person propped up on 
[01:12:00]  the table, hand out rotten tomatoes to the audience.  Let them just throw it at the other sister.  Throw rotten tomatoes at her stupid, pigeonhole head.  All right.  A big crowd with torches and pitchforks.  Put the beast to its death.  So Lady Di is on the bubble, right?  Yeah.  We've given her a week to come up with something.  Marion will not have to go through this.  No.  Because Marion gives us entertaining radio when she comes on. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, don't get me wrong.  She is retarded.  But she's got something.  I'll defend Marion.  I like her a lot.  She sticks up for herself.  She's got spunk.  She's got spunk.  She's got that voice, which is just very original.  She has a sexiness and a pizzazz to her.  You like it?  Yeah.  She's got them cans around.  She is so awful and she doesn't care.  She just doesn't care.  She thinks she looks beautiful.  She sticks up for herself, though.  Big time.  I got great hair.  Big time.  It's fun.  Oh, Portland has just been added to the wow contest. 
[01:13:00]  Welcome, Portland.  Okay.  Go ahead, Anne.  And Lady Di, like we were saying, we really don't see anything.  So it's time to get rid of some of this dead wood.  Here's what we're doing.  On Friday, Lady Di has had since, I guess, Thursday of last week, we gave her a little time period.  By this Friday, she has to come up with something, an idea for anything, a stunt.  She could read something.  I don't care what it is.  She could perform an act, anything that would let the listeners of this show think, hmm, all right, she's worth something for this show. 
[01:13:30]  She should stick around for a while.  If she's going to do stuff like this, then she's worth having around the show.  We leave it up to the audience, and we give Lady Di a shot, a chance, to show her stuff to the audience.  That's how it's going to work.  She's got until Friday.  She's had no clue what she was going to do on Thursday.  She's one of those people, what do I do? 
[01:14:00]  What do you think I should do?  We don't know.  You've got to come up with it yourself.  Now I'm hearing that she's completely freaked out about this whole thing, and she's been bothering everybody.  Well, if she doesn't come up with something good enough, and the audience votes her off the show, she's off.  She's done.  That's it.  Never again to return.  We should get her partner on the air, Marion, because I guess Lady Di's been driving her nuts.  So, yeah.  I think he's back in New York, right?  Hey, Marion.  Hi.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  How you doing?  Let's do it!  Hey!  All right. 
[01:14:30]  That's her sound bite.  She has her own sound bite.  Let's do it!  I like that.  That's cool.  So, Marion, we've been away for a few days.  What's been going on with this whole situation?  She is driving me loony tune with this.  She is in a panic stage.  You got you...  I mean, really, she might be calling you up.  She don't know what to do.  She's afraid.  Marion, has she been...  What?  Marion, has she been bouncing ideas off of you?  Actually, I don't know what she said.  She went through something, but she's not really sure, and she hasn't told me anything yet. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, she hasn't told you anything, huh?  Every night on the phone.  No, every night on the phone.  I'm afraid that they like you better than me, and what's going to happen if I get thrown off the air?  Have we been vague at all on that point?  She's lying to me.  I'm afraid.  You know something?  She's having a panic attack about this, guys.  I've really been looking into this, and I believe, based on just Hodge,  but they enjoy you, man.  You know what I would love to see is these two girls fight it out in the ring,  but something a lot of fans have been doing.  Let me tell you...  Hold on, Marion. 
[01:15:30]  I would love to see these two go at it for three or four rounds.  Just watch them punch each other's faces.  How about you just hand them both hammering?  I would win, but hey...  Eat each other's claw hammers.  That awful head.  Go ahead, Marion.  You know something?  Beat the list better.  Hey, look.  I love you guys.  Believe me.  I love everybody up there.  I go up there just to have fun, but she's taking everything too serious.  She is.  She's flipping out.  She's going to work, telling people at work that she don't know what to do.  She's afraid.  I'm like, I told her not to go off the garbage.  You're a hot little sexy F-monkey. 
[01:16:00]  She's driving everybody crazy with this.  She's on a website.  I love to TF you.  Trying to come out with ideas.  You can just climb in and nod around your schlong.  Wait, she's been going on websites to find ideas?  Yeah, she's trying to find out.  She's asking people.  She's asking people that she talks to on the internet for what to do.  Has she been on Rotten...  I don't know what she goes on.  Rotten.com.  You can tell yourself on a stake.  I don't know what she goes on besides, you know, Sunday music and O.B. Anthony.  She goes on message boards and stuff. 
[01:16:30]  Hey, Platterpush Mouth.  Has she come out with any ideas that she's actually told you?  Actually, no.  Because she doesn't want to tell me because she wants to be a surprise.  She has nothing.  She has nothing.  She has something, but she's not telling me.  I'm not telling you, Norton.  You know why she's not telling me this?  So you can go to the store and get the costume and win the costume prize?  You know why she's not telling me this?  Because she's saying, oh, well, you have a soundbite and I don't have anything.  She says, and they like you better than me.  I told her, Mark, what's a two-year-old?  But that's cool. 
[01:17:00]  Hey, I like that guy.  Hey, I told her.  Hey, Marion.  What?  Do you listen?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I'm just wondering.  I do listen.  That mouth just gets going and it's over, Johnny.  I do listen.  But I wanted to let you know.  Oh, my God, you're not listening.  Stop and breathe.  What?  It's like a freight train.  Can I talk?  Yeah, go ahead.  Stop, breathe, and listen every once in a while.  I'm listening. 
[01:17:30]  Okay, good.  I don't listen.  All right, we're going to bring Lady Di into this conversation.  All right, let's bring Lady Di into this conversation.  Let's go.  She's having a panic attack because she is.  I'm not having a panic attack.  You are still, darling.  You're like flipping out.  I am not flipping out.  I'm just fine.  You are, too.  If my husband was here, I'd put him on the phone because you're driving him crazy.  He just went to the store.  No way.  You are.  You are.  You're calling me up, panicking, having a frigging eye.  No, I was asking you what you think I should do.  Yeah, because you're scared that they like you better than me. 
[01:18:00]  And I told you, they don't like you better than me.  They like us both the same.  But do you know what it is?  That's wrong.  No.  I don't go up there with paranoia.  Diane, you go up there with paranoia.  You're afraid what people are going to think.  No, I'm a little shyer than you.  That's what it is.  The thing is, I don't care what people think about what I think.  I love that we're breaking up a 20-year relationship.  Hold on.  What did you say, Marion?  I'll tell them the town force up their butt.  Not anymore.  Call me the devil's son. 
[01:18:30]  I don't care.  By the way, hi, Boston.  Hi, guys.  Hello, Boston.  How are you doing, Boston?  Oh, this is God.  They don't care.  Diane, listen, I do not care what anybody thinks of what I say when I go up there because  they know the show.  And I love you.  You're my best friend.  I don't have to work around worried about what this one thinks and what that one thinks  because I don't care what anybody thinks.  Okay.  And you've got to stop thinking that.  My house is right here.  Believe me, you're driving donut.  I am doing the best I can. 
[01:19:00]  Believe me.  But you've got to stop thinking after this show in the background.  Yeah.  You've got to stop thinking after this show.  Oh, what if this one hears me now?  I suck it.  You know what you've got to say, Diane?  To hell with them.  Let them kiss your butt if they don't like what you say.  Oh.  That's the way I look at it.  Oh, the big nasty man.  Oh, man.  What?  Marion.  What?  Has Rick told you about the special Marion t-shirts?  No.  You have a t-shirt?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes, we do. 
[01:19:30]  I don't care what people think when I'm up there and saying what I say because it's what  I do.  Marion, hear me out.  I can't believe Rick hasn't told you.  They should be out very, very soon.  A special Let's Do It t-shirt.  Let's do it.  It's got a picture of you.  You know, have you seen the ones of Norton and Stinky and everybody else from the show  that is doing very well?  I've heard that your shirt, because Foundry Music has told people that this is going to  come out, has more pre-orders than any other shirt.  He thinks this is great.  It's bigger than any other shirt. 
[01:20:00]  I'm very happy for you.  You have a t-shirt?  I'm very happy for you.  That's news to me, but hey, if I do, I do.  You've got to get one now.  You need to go up there finals.  When you go up there fire, you've got to do something and say something, but you don't  I am.  But after you say it, you've got to stop thinking, oh, what if this one hears me and that one  hears me?  I don't have to worry about that.  I'm done with that.  I always open up my mouth.  I am done with that.  Believe me.  I'm done with that.  Marion, can we get your permission?  We also want to get the Let's Do It coffee mugs. 
[01:20:30]  Sure.  The Let's Do It coffee mugs?  Yeah.  What about the water bottles?  No, we're thinking Let's Do It coffee mugs.  I'm going to do it almost every day, so I want water bottles.  Your awful face on one side of the mug and your nice little sound bite on the other side.  What do you do at the gym besides avoid anything that would encourage weight loss?  The treadmill.  Hey, hey, I do a treadmill on a bike, and let me tell you, Jim, I've lost a total of  nine pounds in the last month and a half.  How are you doing, Jimmy? 
[01:21:00]  Okay.  Do you realize that glaciers move faster than you move?  I've lost a total of nine pounds in the last month and a half.  She really lost nine pounds.  I'm serious about that.  She really did.  Hey, Lady Di, we're not talking to you.  Shut up.  She's behind people on the treadmill, and it's incentive for them to run.  Okay.  I go on the treadmill.  Believe me.  I'm there every other night.  I'm looking over the shoulder.  I said, Jim, I'm there Sunday morning.  Nine pounds in 45 days is awful.  All right.  So the big question.  Lady Di?  Yes?  Yes.  Have you come up with anything for Friday's show?  Yes, I did.  You have? 
[01:21:30]  Oh.  She's come up with an idea.  Hey, but Diane, you've got to tell them what you come up with because I don't even know.  Well...  Marian, Marian, Marian, Marian.  You're going to have to be quiet during this part of the segment, okay?  All right.  Lady Di, you've come up with something.  Do you think it's something that's really going to wow the crowd and make our audience  accept you and keep you aboard?  And in a wow contest.  Probably.  I don't know.  It depends on everybody.  What's your idea?  Do you want me to tell you my idea?  Yeah.  No, we just asked you. 
[01:22:00]  Telepathy.  Lady Di, because believe it or not, we'll try to help you because we know your idea is  going to stink, and we're going to tell you to go back to the drawing.  Do you think we can spice it up if it's a...  Well, watch.  Go ahead.  What's your idea?  Tell everybody in great detail what your idea is.  Either Scott Burrell or Jim Norton.  One of the two.  Do I get to punch you in your fat, straight tooth's face?  If you want to punch me, go right ahead.  Little chicklet teeth.  Does Jim get to reenact the Bud Dwyer incident?  You have chicklet teeth.  Should I blow your head off while you're chewing cud? 
[01:22:30]  You know what?  You take a gum.  You take some Hubba Bubba.  Chew it up.  Now mold it into human gums.  Now stick chicklets, stick white chicklets in it, and that's your face.  My teeth are great.  That's your mouth.  My teeth are great.  Perfectly straight, like that little monster that came out at the end of Aliens 2.  My teeth are good.  You're missing one detail, though, or you've got to suck on the chicklets for a half hour  before you put them into the gum.  No, use Good and Plenty and suck on them.  Let's put it this way.  I don't like Good and Plenty until the licorice shows.  It has to do with singing, okay? 
[01:23:00]  With Jim Warren or Scott Burrell?  Either one.  Scott Burrell will be there.  Either one.  Lady Di.  Lady Di, stop being Missy Mystery.  Give us what this is in detail.  Do I really have to do that?  She's going to get dressed up, guys.  She has no clue.  You have no clue.  You're lost.  She's going to dress up as what?  Listen, listen, listen.  Listen to her.  I have a clue, okay?  Yeah.  What is the idea?  Diane, tell them what you're going to do. 
[01:23:30]  I am going to get dressed up for the show.  Okay?  Yeah.  Dressed up like a nice dress.  Oh, okay.  Nice shoes.  All right.  You know, it tends to look like an attractive woman.  I like it already.  Okay.  And then what are you going to?  The hairdo.  I'm going to go to the parlor and get a hairdo.  Hairdue.  Hairdue.  Hairdue, Wilma Flintstone.  Who gets a hairdo?  A hairdo contest. 
[01:24:00]  Maybe.  Hey, hubba hubba.  That's a great hairdo.  I can do that too, though.  23 skidoo.  I'm going to do that too.  Can I answer the wow contest?  Can I answer the wow contest?  Can I answer the wow contest?  Hey, you ladies.  Ladies.  You stink.  Ladies.  Realize when we're being funny and shut your traps for a minute.  Okay, Gary.  All right.  All right.  Then we'll give you another.  I wasn't going to say this.  You have to give us your whole idea.  Go ahead.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'm going to serenade somebody.  Whether it's Scottie's studio or Jim Norton.  She's going to serenade Jim Norton. 
[01:24:30]  And what is serenading entailing?  What is this going to be like?  The whole thing.  Sing a song to him.  Sing a song.  Like a happy birthday, Mr. President, like Marilyn Monroe did.  No, not a happy birthday, Mr. President.  A love song.  Like a lady that will marry him.  Let's do it!  She's going to be in the studio.  Let's do it!  A love song.  What kind of love song?  I don't know any kind of love song.  No, you should have the song picked out by now.  Why don't you sing it to food?  Whatever.  Whatever is there. 
[01:25:00]  If you have a hamburger, they'll sing it to a hamburger.  I don't care.  Lady Di, what song?  What song?  Come on.  Always and forever?  Do you know the words, Diane?  Yes, I do.  All right, give us a little bit, Lady Di.  Give us a little piece of that.  Do you want me to give you the words right now?  Do you know the words?  Give us a little piece.  Yes, I do.  All right, go ahead.  Sing it.  Sing a little bit.  Yes, I am.  Hey, Marion, shut up.  Let Di sing this.  All right, go ahead, Lady Di.  Don't tell her to shut up.  Say, be quiet.  That's my turn to get picked on. 
[01:25:30]  You know, it's nice to say, be quiet.  Don't say, shut up.  Just sing, you ass.  Always and forever.  All right, you know what me to sing?  You want me to sing?  Would you keep singing?  Sing.  Okay, I'm born here.  Always and forever, this moment with you.  Gong show.  Is just like a dream to me.  Anybody ever watch the gong show?  Gong.  And I know tomorrow  Gong!

[01:26:30]  You really care  And we'll spend tomorrow  Together  How's that sound?  The only time I want to hear you say  Always and forever  Is if someone says  How long will you be fat for?  I knew you were going to say  Stuff to like that  That was probably  The most horrific rendition  Of any song I've ever heard  Oh, no, it was  But Karen Carpenter  Would do a better job now  Anthony?  Alright, I'm in 
[01:27:00]  Yeah  Hold on, shut up  What?  I'm intrigued  Are you intrigued?

[01:34:00]  Today  This is our hangover show  We spent like 12 to 15 hours  At the brand new CMGI field  Last night for the River Rave  The WBCN River Rave  It was a huge success, Anthony  Why didn't they call it the Yankees suck field  Since that term is so popular up here  How many Yankees suck shirts did you see?  Stickers  Stickers  Like they really went to work on that whole thing  Because they're obsessed  Oh, apparently  Let it go, you drunken white dopes 
[01:34:30]  We never think of you  Alright, Yankee fans occasionally will think  Who we play?  Oh yeah, Boston  They suck  We don't run around in the middle of December  Yelling, Boston sucks  We don't care  Anytime there's a little crowd  Three people or more  You'll get the chants started  They were chanting at the  Of course they were  At the concert yesterday  You're never going to  That obsession they had with the Yankees  You're never going to hear that from Yankee fans ever  See, I agree with the Red Sox fans  Who's in first place?  Oh, stop it 
[01:35:00]  You say this every year  Yeah, but look who's in first place  Look who's in first place  That doesn't matter  Stop it  I'm glad they're in first place  Just to hurt them  There's another eight years in this season  How long does that take?  Let me take a look  There you go  Look at that  First place  Of course they are  We know  Hey, let me take a look at my team  Where's the  Where are the Mets?  Where are the National  Yeah, I got the National  Where's the Metropolitan  The Metropolitan  My team stinks  And we got Mo Vaughn  And I was screaming and yelling  Don't make that trade  We don't want him  Oh, boy 
[01:35:30]  What has he got?  Four dingers, Earl?  Four homers  And he's batting like 228  Stinks  Go, Mo  You want to get a guy 15 years after he was good  It's great  Awful  Yeah, that's smart  Bring a guy that loves strip clubs to New York  Wow  Yeah, but at least he doesn't have to drive 40 minutes  And, you know, flip his car  Flip cars and stuff  Yeah, great  Anyway  Here we are  Hey, this is our sports break  Anyone see the Tyson fight this weekend?  Oh  Yeah, I wasn't able to see it live 
[01:36:00]  Which pissed me off  We saw it in the secret room today  Yeah  Here in the secret room here at WBCN  They tape a lot of things in that secret room  We saw the Tyson, yeah, Lewis fight today  Did you feel bad for Tyson?  I did  Totally  It reminded me when I was growing up  And Ali was at the end of his  Probably at the end of his career  And started losing fights  And not looking superhuman anymore  We're on to the decon fog on  Tyson  Tyson looked awful 
[01:36:30]  He was never in that fight  He did nothing  There was a couple of those left hooks that he threw  That, you know, if they connected  It would have been lights out  But, you know  Not even  I don't even think so  Because he connected  In the early rounds, I'm saying  I mean, after the second round  That fight was over  Lewis was like nothing wrong with him  The fight was over  And he's like  Well, that was quite a nice little boat  Yeah  That was entertaining, wasn't it?  I had fun beating him up  I kicked Mark Tyson's ass  What you gonna do about it?  Nah, you beat him 
[01:37:00]  And all the Tyson  Once around the park, bitch  I just beat up Tyson  And that's the funniest thing I've ever heard  Tyson couldn't get in close  No  The old Tyson, you know what he's all about  He would just rush you and beat the crap out of you  Old Tyson  He couldn't get past that jab of Lewis's  He'd run out of his corner  The first ring of the first round of the bell  Hey, come running out  Squat down  Pop up with a fist under your chin  And end the fight  And a bunch of disappointed pay-per-view viewers 
[01:37:30]  Would say, oops, I blinked  Yeah  Now to see him sit through eight rounds  Just being beaten up  He got beat up  He didn't lose the fight  He was beaten up  You made a good point about the fight  They showed the knockout punch, I guess  Or the one they're calling the knockout punch  Because then Lewis kind of  Helped them down to the canvas  Yeah  But I mean, but Tyson was going down  No matter what  Gone  It looked like he was just gonna fall in slow motion  So Lewis kind of helped him along  But you brought up a good point  They showed the punch in slow motion 
[01:38:00]  And his face moved really fast  His head snapped  I guess from, what, left to right  Or whatever  And it snapped so fast  And I'm like, oh my god  This clip is in slow motion  And you still see his head go  Oh, his jaw goes out  Crap just goes flying out of his face  He goes down  That's it for the entire count  Bye-bye  Just to see him laying on his back  And not just knocked out  We've seen that before 
[01:38:30]  With Buster Douglas  But beaten up  He was bleeding  It was running off his head  Onto the canvas  His eyes puffed up  His nose bleeding  His mouth  Everything  And you look at him  And just like  Oh, god, I remember  I remember the old days  He just doesn't seem as scary anymore  No  The goddamn English guy beat him up  And they're a whole nation of fags  Come on  I'm starting to think  He's kind of like Fonzie  Talks a good game  But you don't really see Fonzie fight 
[01:39:00]  You never see Fonzie fight  You know what I mean?  You always  Back off  Maybe that's Tyson now, you know?  Dude, I like Tyson, man  I didn't feel bad for him, though  I didn't think I would be rooting for Tyson  I was so rooting for him during this fight  How did you not feel bad for Tyson?  I think  I've always liked him  Recting him for a heavyweight  He's going to be in the engine costume  Hi-ya-ya-ya-ya  Hi-ya-ya-ya  You have to root for a depressed rapist  Who just punches people in the face in Harlem  I mean, I love Tyson for his personal life  But it's just like  Ali beat everyone good, man 
[01:39:30]  Ali fought great, great fighters  I mean, Tyson, although I like him  He couldn't beat Holyfield  He can't beat him  Come on, man  He beat up on Marvis Frazier  In his day, there was no one around  Yeah, he fought all these guys  Later on after he went through all the trouble  With the jail and stuff  You're right  I mean, I'm telling you right now  No one was beating Tyson  When Tyson was in his early days  No one  George Foreman would have  No one  No one  Should we break out the old tapes of Tyson?  He was an animal in there  Yeah, but he was  In the early  I'm telling you  When he was in his early 20s 
[01:40:00]  I remember him  Most of the fighters that went in the ring with him  Were scared S-less  Exactly  They were scared  And there weren't any big contenders around at the time  So you can't  That's not his fault  You're right  He destroyed everybody  Based on his performance in the ring with the people he did fight  You could see like  Oh my God, just devastated  Look at who Ali beat later in life  In his early 30s  He beat Foreman  He beat Foreman  When you say  Well, Tyson didn't fight these guys  You're right  Because they weren't around  And look at Lennox Lewis  Destroyed Tyson  And Ali beat Foreman  When Ali was a lot older than him  I'll give it to Ali  I think Ali's the greatest fighter of all time 
[01:40:30]  But no one was beating  No one was beating Tyson early on in his career  I regret doing no fights now  In the whole part of my career  I regret that wholeheartedly  George Foreman's making millions with his George Foreman grill  And I'm pretty much brain damaged from my decon foregone commercial  Hey, Mohammed  Yeah, just set off the decon foregone bomb in the room  And say the script  Decon foregone, Knox Rose is dead 
[01:41:00]  Cut, do it again  Decon foregone, Knox Rose is  One more, Mike  One more, Mohammed  I suck  One more, Mike  Your extend away  Anyway  The poor guy  I think it was from the insecticide  And the punches to his head  When he was 40 years old  There you go  And, you know, Tyson's  It's just going to get worse from here now  You know he's going to be one of these fighters  That just keeps on fighting  It's just going to get  Uglier and uglier and uglier  He said it was a good payday 
[01:41:30]  That's what he said  Right  I want to thank him for the payday  Well, he's  I mean  What is he going to do  Besides fight?  Some of these guys are able to kind of go along with their lives  He's a freak  Maybe endorse products  And this guy will just keep fighting until there's no brain left  Who is that?  Joe Lewis opened up the restaurant?  Yeah  Yeah, he opened up that  Jack Dempsey  Come down to Mike's Grill  I run the place  I'm the accountant  Hey, wait, I'm broke  What happened?  Get the Don King special 
[01:42:00]  That's why I come and tenderize it myself  On my face  That mother F  He stole all my money  That was a good payday  He still has to fight, Tyson  Yeah, because of what?  He made 20 million off the fight  And that's not even  That's not going to even make a dent into his debt  Not a dent  They're saying  When you're put away for that many years  And you're trying to, I guess, run a corporation  That is Mike Tyson  Hey, probably  You got no money coming in  Right  You're in jail for rape  Want to listen to some Tyson clips? 
[01:42:30]  I love the Tyson clips  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  What's the matter?  Uh-oh  What's the matter?  I have to touch it, ass wife  Because that's not the track I'm on  Don't touch it  Don't touch it  Don't even look at it  Let me go to this, right?  There's a little tighter on it  Don't touch it  I gotta touch it  You hit the wrong job  I hit the little wheelie thing  I didn't know BCN had a little wheelie thing  You hit that?  Oh, yeah  You're not supposed to touch the wheelie thing  No  Okay, why don't we go to the clip here 
[01:43:00]  Tyson gets in an uppercut  Aides of Tokyo  And the one time he got the busted  That is the NBA crowd  And that's going to be  Perhaps the end of the fight  It'll take some turns for Mike to get up from that shot  Nine  Eight  Nine  He's up  And it's low  It's knocked off by Tyson  And banishes him  From the upper stratosphere of the heavyweight division  Right now  The first performance 
[01:43:30]  Mike's life  He was up against the guy who was way too short  Where'd you get that sound clip there, Rick?  Off the old Betamax  Are we listening to real audio?  What is that?  It was a little  There's a hum in the background  That's louder than the actual audio  That was a tape  Tape you guys watched  No, it sounded much better  When we were in the secret room  Yeah  Much better  Maybe it was just that one clip  All right  Why don't we try another clip? 
[01:44:00]  Look at you being the optimist today  No, it's not  Go ahead  Ladies and gentlemen  Much better  Tonight here in Memphis, Tennessee  The legacy of a three-time heavyweight champion  Has been embraced  As the referee reaches the count of ten  At two minutes, 25 seconds of round number eight  The winner by knockout victory  And still the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world 
[01:44:30]  The pride of great Britain  Let's do it  How annoying is Michael Buffer?  I hate him  Enough  Oh, you're stupid  Run, run, run  Go die  Who cares?  You know that he goes around the country  Suing people for saying that?  Like, you can't even say it now  Yeah, let's get ready to rumble  I said it, faggot  And it's stupid  But this guy  Let's get ready to rumble  You can't do it in his inimitable fashion 
[01:45:00]  He is awful  He spends most of his time suing DJs and other people  Oh, I dare not say it  Let's get ready for A6  He is so horrible  Just announced the winner  Stupid  Yeah, stop trying to use Michael Buffer  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Oh, no  Thank you so very much  It was wonderful being in here  And able to spa and box with this wonderful man 
[01:45:30]  Mike's eyes  You want to listen to Tyson after the fight?  Whatever did you do then, McBrag  Well, I took the gorilla  And smacked him about the face a few times  And he fell down  My goodness, McBrag  Remember that?  Yeah, old school  I pulled out my boxing gloves  And punched him in the face numerous times  He seemed to just stand there  As I jabbed and jabbed and jabbed  Without any return 
[01:46:00]  My goodness, what an adversary  Quite  Very good  All right, here's Tyson after the fight  Mike, have you changed your opinion now of Lennox Lewis?  Well, no  Believe it or not, I've known Lennox for like 15, 16 years  We've always been friends  But in competition  In competition  In competition, the best man has to win  We have to do everything we can 
[01:46:30]  I'm happy for him to give me a fight  The payday was wonderful  I really appreciate it  And if he could be kind enough  I'd love to do it again  I think I could beat you  We'll try one more time  Oh, boy  Him begging  This is where it begins  He was begging for a rematch  That was one of three times  He asked him for a rematch  And Lennox is just  Well, wonderful  Yes, yes  It was quite a fight, wasn't it?  Never saying he'd give him a rematch  There's no reason to fight him again  I want a rematch  I want to do it again  I want him  Yes, yes, I heard you the first time  Clever little man 
[01:47:00]  Why don't you go bleed over there  All right, more Tyson audio  Mike, what gives you any indication  That you could beat him  After this performance  And was it a lack of quality opponents  Going into this  That hurt you?  I explained before  I needed two more fights  Or three more fights  To fight him  But I believe  If I took that route  The fight probably would have never happened  He wouldn't have waited for me  And again, he was just splendid  A masterful boxer  I used to take my hand off  To say, please  Give me one more chance  I'd be greatly appreciated  That's my favorite line of the night 
[01:47:30]  Can we hear it again?  I take my hand off  He took his own hand off?  I take my  Let me just detach my hand  And he just handed it over to Tyson  Oh, look  He's giving me his hand  Is he one of those G.I. Joe guys  With the Kung Fu grip  You just pull it off the  That would leave you with one  Right  Let me hear that again  Mike, what gives you any indication  That you could beat him  After this performance  And was it a lack of quality opponents  Going into this?  You know, after Jim Gray  Asked that question 
[01:48:00]  If I was Tyson  I would have punched him  In his big, bulbous head  And said  How about this indication?  Yeah, that's one fight  That hurt you  I explained before  I needed two more fights  Or three more fights  To fight him  But I believe  If I would have took that route  The fight probably  Would have never happened  He wouldn't have waited for me  And again, he was just splendid  A masterful boxer  I used to take my hand off  To say, please  Give me one more chance  I'd be great in there  I'd be great in there  I'd be great in there  I'd be great in there  Yeah, I love him  He's a great fighter  It's amazing 
[01:48:30]  He would mathful  And I'd take my kneecap off for him  For some reason  Ow, I'm deconstructing myself  I'd take my hand off  Ouch  I'd take my hand off  Yeah, I just chewed it off  Like when a fuga gets stuck in a trap  And he gotta chew his own leg off to get out  That's what I do for you  Because you're masterful  Don't you do that  After you take some of those ugly broads  Home to your hotel room  Well, sometimes I have to take my hand off  To get it out from under their neck  Because they're so pig ugly 
[01:49:00]  That's funny  But the other night  I was hanging with Jim Norton  And I said I was Anthony  And I made out with a chick  In the dressing room  And then I rape her  But Anthony in trouble now  I vehemently denied it  V-E-H-E-M-E-N-T  Wow  Yeah, that clocking in the noggin  Seemed to help my spelling  Theoretical speaking  Want to hear another Tyson clip? 
[01:49:30]  We have one more  It wasn't meant to be  I've known little Terry since he was 16  15 years old  I have mad respect  Everything I said  Was in proposition for promoting the fight  He knows I love him and his mother  And I know if he thinks I don't respect  And don't love him  He's crazy  Like I said before  He's a magnificent  A prolific fighter  And he should continue fighting  I would just love for him  To give me another shot  Wow, he just kept saying that  Over and over again  Give me another shot, please  Please  He prolific  P-R-O-F 
[01:50:00]  Oh, it's coming back again  I can't spell no more  Oh, when he wiped the blood  Off of Lewis' cheek  Yeah  That's your blood, Mike  Oh, Lennox, you look like you hurt  You're bleeding  I can't seem to find an injury from you  You got to be bleeding  Because I see it hitting the mat under us  When he laid down  When he went down  And it was coming from his eyes  All the way down the side of his head 
[01:50:30]  From his forehead  Down his nose  Like every hole in his head  Was leaking blood  Really?  It was sad to say  It was sad to say  You want to hear Lennox Lewis?  Nah, nah, nah  I just wanted to complete my legacy  You know, everybody was saying  You know, this fight  Is going to count on my legacy  So I just wanted to prove to people  That, you know, I'm the best fighter  In the world  On the planet  No guy tests this money  I was a bit confused 
[01:51:00]  Because they drive on the other side  Of the street in England  So I saw the punches  Coming at me  From the other direction  That's my excuse  I'm sticking to it  Mike, also  I heard the bell  It goes  Me, me, me, me  The British Reckers  Oh, gay  Slow down, Mike  He beat the crap out of you  That was the worst part  He beat him silly  One more from Lennox Lewis  He said you had to win this fight  To clean up boxing  Do you feel you've accomplished that? 
[01:51:30]  Well, I just showed  I showed boxing  You know, who's the best in the world  I went out there  And showed them  I'm a fugitive specialist  I can adapt to any style  And, you know  He showed me one style  That a lot of people  Didn't think I was going to be able to deal with  But I was able to deal with it  A lot of people thought  He was going to get away from my job  But nobody gets away from my job  Lennox Lewis in Quadrophenia  That is some accent he's got there  In Clockwork Orange  He's the pinball wizard  The pugilistic wizard  Right  There has to be a twist 
[01:52:00]  I'm a pugilistic wizard  And Mike Tyson's really a piece  And your queen is a C  F the queen  She ain't a human being  I like that song  But she is  Very benevolent  B-E-N-E-V-O-L-A-N-T-E  Benevolent  Close  Pretty good  You better be spelling these right  Or I look really stupid 
[01:52:30]  Don't make me look so introspective  Or try to spell it  I got hit in the head  I'm looking forward to this Saturday  Lewis Tyson is on  I'm psyched for the fight  It's going to be beautiful  I'm going to kick his ass  And eat his children  And F his mother  But I say that to promote the fight  Not any disrespect for Lewis himself  Because he knows I love the man  Even though I A-F'd his mother  And when my C hit her throat 
[01:53:00]  She choked and gagged  And I punch her  In her ugly effing monkey face  But let me tell you  I say this to promote the fight  I love the man  And I'm going to pin him down  And grease up my pole  And slam it  Until it hits his brain stem  But he knows  I've known him 15 years  He's a good friend of mine  We're pundilistical experts  Jude Jafiaco speaking  That's wonderful  I went down hard 
[01:53:30]  Oh it's coming back  Oh no that's right  The fight was on already  Yeah  Who are you going to fight next Mike?  I don't know  I'm thinking of either  Either Ben from your show  Because he got some moves  I see him drunk  His arms is moving  And I never know  Where they're going to hit  And he'll do that crazy thing  With his hair  So it's scary to look at  He'll pull it up like a mohawk  Last of the mohawkians  Why don't you fight Screech next?  That's more your speed  Oh my god 
[01:54:00]  He got a great battle tactic though  He fought that Arnold Horshack  And I think he talked to him beforehand  And Arnold was low to sleep  So Screech could just hit him  About the face and the head  That's a good defense  Because I and Mike be going  Yeah I'm going  Oh god I'm so sleepy  This you know some of the words  That are coming out your mouth  Suck and are lulling me to sleep  They're dust and diamond  Oh now he's pushing me 
[01:54:30]  And I don't even care  I hope he knocked me out  So I don't got to listen to his boring ass no more  Please knock me out  Please  Made me yearn for the comedy of Ron Tolillo  All right  Mike will be hanging with us today  Why don't we take a break  And we'll continue  We got a couple girls here for the WOW contest  That starts today Anthony  Fantastic 
[01:55:00]  And if you don't know what's going on with that  We'll tell you all about it next  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show  Broadcasting live from Boston today  It's our hangover show  We did 12 hours at the River Rave yesterday  I want to thank everyone at WBCN  We had a great great time  They treated us like rock stars  It was ridiculous  Hooked us up  Oedipus and Chachi  And the rest of the gang  Callie and Steve Strick  It was amazing  An amazing time  And here's one of the DJs 
[01:55:30]  That was in the rave tent  Yeah  With all the kids  Doing their ex  Timo Moss man  I mean the rave tent  That was unbelievable to check out  Did you check out any of that?  Dude  They just kind of stand around him  And watch the DJ just spin  I did not go near the rave tent  I was out in that area  But I didn't go near or in the tent  Did it scare you?  No I didn't want to look like ecstasy dad  You know  I mean there's people in there  They're doing things  I have no clue 
[01:56:00]  What it's all about  Do the glow sticks scare you?  Dude I'm going to do the thing  With the glow sticks  And freak you out  Start doing it  I don't know  I don't know anything  About that scene hoping  So I figured I best  Just steer clear  You could ask Ben some questions  Ben doesn't know anything  About that scene either  Stop it  When have you been raving?  Dude one of our pals  Was DJing last night  Yeah  Liquid Todd  Oh well that guy knows  The scene  That guy knows everything  About that scene 
[01:56:30]  I was a little disappointed  I didn't see him last night  He was too busy spinning  I remember last river rave  I got to sit on a couch  And talk with him  For about two hours  And I was really upset  With myself  Because I knew everything  He was saying  I understood  So I knew I was  Completely intoxicated  And couldn't drive home  Because I was understanding him  I've never hung out  With a guy for six straight hours  That doesn't blink  Yeah  And he'll change subjects  Like boom  You want to know  What he's talking about  Yeah  Dude Paul Oakenfold 
[01:57:00]  You know he walked in  Like Mick Jagger  Was the headline DJ  Yeah he's the king  He's the king of the scene  Anthony  He's the big guy  When it comes to it  Well he does remixes  For like U2  And a lot of the big bands  But you know  Who?  You ever heard of them?  What U2?  A little band called U2  Never heard of them guys  New kids upstarts  Yeah but it was fun  Yeah  Again though  You know looking for the beer  We got to make sure  Next year they know  We should have our own supply  Back away  I hate to be a prima donna  And start making demands like this 
[01:57:30]  But we were running around  From dressing room to dressing room  Where did you finally get it?  Papa Roach  Those guys were cool  We're pilfering from the bands  For God's sake  Kobe was really cool  He was like  Come on in  You know he was cool  Yeah  Yeah they shared the beer  All right  A few more things  We want to do  Before we hit the road  And get back to New York  It's so funny  Rick called me last night  And I just knew today  Was going to be a problem  Because I mean  We were hanging for 12-15 hours  I mean everyone's just  Getting blitzed  You know  A little tired today 
[01:58:00]  True  So last night  Rick calls me around  11 or so  And I go  Rick  Did you bring any  Jim Brewer bits  To Boston for us?  He goes  The latest Jim Brewer bit  Won't be ready for another week  Damn it  You're S out of luck  Because the excuse today was  Hey guys  Hey we've got to get back to New York  We've got to leave right now  Driving back  We've got to go  I'm telling you  We have to  But check out Jim Brewer  This bit was really funny last week  Now we don't even have that  No it's not ready  So  Well maybe Dustin Diamond  Is he around  That we can bring him in? 
[01:58:30]  Bring on the ladies  Yeah we're going to bring  That's always good  We're going to bring them in  We're doing the wow contest  It began today  Anthony  You want to explain this to the folks?  Just like all the other contests  The Naughty Nighty contest  Yeah  Which was huge by the way  It was huge  And if you remember  The winner of the Naughty Nighty contest  I barely saw Nighty in her pictures  Right  I think it's more  I don't know  Suggestion  Than a rule  So when we're doing a wow contest like this  Of course the girls have to wow for the camera  But 
[01:59:00]  You know  We leave it very open  As to how they want to present that wowing  Like the Naughty Nighty  Yeah there could be a nighty  Maybe on her dresser behind her  As long as it's in the background of the shot  I think it's officially a Naughty Nighty contestant  Yes  There could be a night light in the wall  Close enough  We don't care  Get naked  But we're celebrating Whip Them Out Wednesday  This is the first time we've done a huge contest  Surrounding wow  One lady's going to walk away with $5,000 cash  A cash prize of $5,000 
[01:59:30]  And I think we got some of the men's magazines  That are coming to the table thinking about doing something in their magazine  Oh  I think we're still working out the details of that  It might happen  It might not  A little extra something for the girls  Oh we can't even talk about  All right  We're working on it  Working on some details  They're very interested in this contest Anthony  So even more than just $5,000 cash  And the chance of men all over the world jacking it to your picture  Right?  Yes  Nice  The qualifying starts today  I don't even know if the other stations got any ladies showing up today 
[02:00:00]  I have no clue  Where's the list of stations again?  You're not going to have these things start  Is this all up on opianthony.com?  All right  Go to opianthony.com to find out if your city is participating in the wow contest  Okay?  I'm just  I'm wondering what Sacramento's going to give us this time around  If you remember now for the Naughty Nighty contest  They came to the table with some of the hottest girls ever  And a lot of people said it was a fix  Because they had girls  The photography was perfect  The lighting 
[02:00:30]  The setting they were in  Their bodies  Amazing  And the guy that was posing the girls  It looked like a penthouse shoot  Yeah  They were great  And I think there was a little bit of a listener backlash because of that  I remember her for the Naughty Nighty contest  Is she going to be in the wow contest?  She doesn't even know I'm talking to her  This girl was beautiful, man  She's beautiful  What was her name?  Megan  Megan  Oh, right, right  Wow, Lee  I remember her  Yeah, I don't know if she's here for the wow contest or not  But we'll find out  Going in and talking  Oh, no, out! 
[02:01:00]  Earl's giving us the out sign  Earl's moving his arms back and forth like, no, no  No, no  What happened, Earl?  Earl, get in here  Hello  She doesn't want in on this contest?  No, she does not  She's got a nice set, though  Look, she's all shy now  You got a nice, you know, they're nice  Yeah  Yeah  Who's that she's with?  Her boyfriend, probably  Ah, that's probably the monkey wrench  We'll call him monkey wrench  And we already have a problem with Cleveland  Yeah  I guess Cleveland is not allowed to take any naked pictures in their building anymore 
[02:01:30]  After the Naughty Naughty Contest  I am very interested in finding out where they're going to take all these pictures  Because they're going to find another location  And what?  Oh, great  Some warehouse down in the warehouse district  That's why Cleveland rocks  You know, alright, they have a problem  Most stations will go, oh, well, we can't do it, sorry  But no, they're going to figure it out  And they're going to bring the girls  They're going to bust them somewhere  They make it work  They will make it work  I don't understand how, if the girls aren't coming in naked 
[02:02:00]  And then they walk into the studio  Why can't they take pictures of them?  How does the building even know what the hell's going on?  You're right  In the studio  You know what I mean?  You got to lie a little bit  Say, no, we're not taking pictures of nude girls  And then you parade them in  Strip them down  Click, click  Alright, well, we'll find out  But it's $5,000 cash provided by RisqueVideo.com  Your 24-hour adult video novelty and DVD superstore  That's Risque, R-I-S-Q-U-E, video.com  Philly got us this grand prize, right? 
[02:02:30]  Yes, thank you, Philly  Again, I know how these things start off  First of all, they start off slow  And then we end up with 100 contestants  Like we did with the Naughty Nighty contest  And girls, if you're going to be the first couple of girls in on this contest  Don't do the medical photo book shot  You know?  Oh, it's a wow contest  Must just show breasts  They stand straight up  Do the side shot like a boob mug shot  It's not sexy 
[02:03:00]  It looks lame  It's not going to help you out  The girls seem more relaxed if they come in a little later in the contest  Because I think what they do is  They go to opianthony.com  And check out all the other contestants  And go, oh, okay, I can do a little better  And then they start, like, posing and moving  And then the original ones come in because they want to do reshoots  Just make it hot  Make it sexy  Right  And don't start  Remember some of the contests we had  Where the girls would come into the studios in New York  Stand against the wall with bad lighting  Hitting them from bad angles  And just stand there  And then turn sideways 
[02:03:30]  Ooh, hot  And Rick would take the picture from below  And it would look like they got a giant pear ass  Yeah  You gotta really think about what you're doing, lady  And New York better not disappoint us  Oh, stop  Of course they will  I mean, the 90-90 thing  Yeah  We did get  Tevita  Tevita from New York  So  I wonder if she's going to enter into this one  Oh, you think?  It would be nice to see 
[02:04:00]  You think she's going to show up in?  She could maybe win by a nose  I don't know  Could happen  Could happen  And also, I think we should announce it today  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show  Sex for Sam 3  Can you believe it?  Sex for Sam 3  Oh, has it already been three of these?  And this year it's going to be a two-day event  Two days?  We're going two days with this one this year  Boy, we are milking stuff more and more 
[02:04:30]  We're getting smarter  We're smart  We're very smart  And for anybody that doesn't know  This is great  It's sex throughout all areas of a major city  And you get points  We should throw a curveball and go to another city  Yeah, Philly would be really good  There's a lot of history in Philly  A lot of places  What about Boston?  What about D.C.?  All great cities to do sex for Sam  Yeah  True  D.C. would be amazing  I'm telling you right now  When we do a homeless shopping spree 
[02:05:00]  We've got to do it in another city  Because every mall is ready for us this coming December  Well, I'm looking forward to sex for Sam  That's going to be good  Well, Anthony, this year  Because it's going to be huger than it has been in the past couple of years  We're going to have qualifying and all that  Qualifying?  It's kind of like what we do with the 55-gallon drum challenge  Boy, we do milk it  Well, why not?  We could have some fun  How are we qualifying?  I guess, you know, the couples have to  We haven't worked out all the details yet  We need another week or two before we start this contest 
[02:05:30]  But go out and show us their  I don't know  They have to come up with something to get into the contest  You know, we'll leave it up to them  They come down  They do their thing  Like, okay  We've got to  You've got to prove  I guess you've got to show us  That you've got the kahunas to do like sex for Sam  Because it  Takes a lot of balls  Yeah  You can't be shy with this contest  So we're looking for couples that are willing to just let it all  You know  Hang out  Who did we scare the hell out of that he fled the studio? 
[02:06:00]  Oh, that was Michael Winslow  Michael Winslow came in, unfortunately, during our Sex for Sam contest  One of the places the couple had to have sex in front of was a celebrity  Right  So, I guess they figured he was a celebrity  Actually, no, they were running  No, because honestly, they didn't think he was a celebrity  Oh, really?  They didn't think so?  No, they saw him and kept running into the studio  And they had sex in front of Jim Cook  Oh, Jim Cook, who's a celebrity, sure  But they started in the bathroom 
[02:06:30]  To get, like, going  To get ready and get everything happening  They were, uh, hmm  They were kind of like  They were pretty attached to each other  Yeah, they looked like Siamese twins  Right, right  And they bolt out of the bathroom  They're doing, like, the crab walk  Because they're kind of connected  Right past Michael Winslow  Who just looks at these, uh, semi-nude people doing these things  And got up and left  Because he realized he had to deal with Disney or something  Yeah  And it freaked him out 
[02:07:00]  And he ran  He didn't walk  He ran out of there  And we haven't heard from him since  Oh, the controversy of making helicopter noises  Couldn't, uh  Yeah  Couldn't, uh, keep up with that?  No  Making machine gun sounds?  Ooh  No  You mean, wait, that's the guy making it?  Oh, stop it  Forty-five more minutes to go  They'll sit through that act  All right, so Rick is taking pictures of some of the ladies  That showed up at, uh, the WBCN studios today  Oh, yeah  And we got, uh, we got Psycho Tim's girls 
[02:07:30]  Somewhere around here  Oh, the, uh, the ringers  Those two?  Hey, there they are  All right, we're gonna get them in in a few minutes  We should take another break, though  We have to catch up here  Catch up a little  Also, when we get back  We gotta talk about, uh, Winona  Shoplifting  Shoplifting Winona  And we found out something, uh, through that news story  That Norton enlightened us on  On that, uh, that's gonna shock you  That's one of those teasers  Oh, you wanna tease it that way?  It'll shock you  All right, we'll tease it that way  I guess Dice, Dice shoplifts 
[02:08:00]  For a goof, though, we heard  For a goof  Well, we'll, Jim will explain in a few minutes, okay?  Yeah  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show  Another band that rocked the river rave yesterday in Boston  Drowning Pool Bodies  Actually, I missed their set  You did?  Yeah  What's that?  Well, you can't see them all  A lot of stuff going on  I missed their set  I just realized that  And I wanted to see them  And I remember being pissed at myself  That I missed, uh, Missed, uh, Drowning Pool 
[02:08:30]  Well, there's 21 bands to check out, eh?  A lot of bands  Plus, you gotta walk around  Do some people watching  Check out all the lovely ladies  Doing their thing, you know?  I understand  Make out with the listeners  Gotta go to Half Pipe  And do a few moves  Right  You're too busy making out with listeners, you know  I know, and you're tearing up the Half Pipe  Yes, I was  That's how it works  Can I just interject  Can I just interject  Can I just say that I've seen the photos  With the first girl  And she's so hot  I want to put a bullet in my head  Really?  Yeah 
[02:09:00]  I can't even get turned on  She's so sick  Yeah, remember the cafe latte  That showed up at the booth  When we were kind of signing things yesterday?  Yeah  Uh, we were signing, uh, for about an hour  And we would have stayed there  But Chris Benoit was having a, a conniption  A conniption  Wow  And, uh, we had her leave  That's impressive  But, uh, we met her there  Yeah, I know  It's unbelievable  She came down to the station today  To get in on the, the WOW contest  Her, her picture should be up on opianthony.com  Later tonight or tomorrow 
[02:09:30]  But, uh, Opie  I'd say we have a finalist  Without a doubt  I'd say we have a finalist  Without a doubt  And we usually say that  But this girl is just, uh, she's, she's like a ten  Arms over the head rule  Uh, okay  Yeah  Oh, Rick's going with the arms over the head  Remember the controversy?  We had a controversy in another one of our contests  I don't know  I think it was Best Fingernail Contest  And when the boobs were photographed  Uh, the girls had their hands over their head  And, uh, people were complaining like 
[02:10:00]  Oh, when I came in to take my pictures  Um, I had my arms down  And these girls have their arms up  So it makes it look better  You know what?  You gotta, you gotta leave it to the ladies though  Exactly  Some might think, you know what?  I don't have to do the over the, the head, uh, trick  You work it however you want  Whatever you think is going to make you look better  That was part of the best smile  Was that the best smile contest?  I think it was the best hair follicle contest  And when, when her thatch was photographed  So, uh, we're getting some nice contestants here in Boston today 
[02:10:30]  Very nice  Yeah, wasn't, uh, Chris Benoit being a douchebag?  And I said it to his face  And, uh, then I kicked his ass  And then I woke up  No, we learned our lesson  We learned our lesson from last year  We thought we'd be wise  And I got choked out  Uh-huh  I wasn't going to say anything this year  I never heard of him  Well, you don't know  Well, we were sitting at the table  And, uh, we had a lot of listeners  Some old faces, some new faces  That wanted to say hi  And we were signing things  And I guess they were scheduled to start signing at 3  Yeah 
[02:11:00]  And it was like 3.15  And they showed up and they got all impatient  They literally pulled us off our chairs  There was a huge line  And the line, it turned out  Was, uh, a lot of those people wanted to say hi to us  Good  How great would that be  Everybody just walking sideways off the line  And who else was with them?  Terry  Terry  Was there  Hey, you gotta get them to sign something  With her  I think with her children  Just children?  I don't know  There were some youngsters in the, uh, artist, uh, section  And, you know, she was playing with them 
[02:11:30]  Or sent them up to play with the PlayStation and stuff  So, I don't know  She doesn't seem like a kid either  You know what I mean?  That's all I'm saying  But Chris Benoit, he's got, like  Man, I'm not, I don't know  If he's doing the juice or anything like that  But he looks like the type of guy  That is on steroids  He's got, like, those ridiculous muscles  With the veins that are just like  Boom, boom, boom, boom 
[02:12:00]  Just working the whole time  God, I hope he knows the difference between our voices  Opie, you shouldn't say that stuff  No, no, no  Chris Benoit  That was Anthony  Well, we'll rip your head off  But then they had an attitude  When we left, we're like  Alright, we'll leave  We'll just hang out by the side  We hung out by the side of the line  And anyone that wanted to post a sign to something  We were doing it  And they really didn't even say hi to us  And we have a pretty good relationship with the WWE  It looks like they really didn't want to be there 
[02:12:30]  No  And most of the wrestlers we meet  And they do appearances like this  They're really into it  They're cool  They look like they were just  They were just kind of punching the clock  And couldn't wait to get out of town  Triple H  Cool guy to hang out with  He comes in the studio  And we have a good time with him  But they do, yeah  They seem like, meh  Don't want to be there  Who are these hacks sitting in our seats  Well, they were right  But they didn't have to be so nasty about it  Alright  So you have a story about Dice shoplifting  We were looking at the paper today  And there's a story about Winona 
[02:13:00]  She might, she ain't doing jail time  Who are you kidding?  But I guess it turns out  She's been doing this a lot  This shoplifting thing  Winona, she was caught  Yeah, with a bunch of clothes  She says it was a misunderstanding  That she was, what?  Trying them on  And taking them for a walk outside the store  I mean, what kind of misunderstanding?  You either paid for something  Or you didn't  Have you ever shoplifted?  Hell yeah  When I was a kid  I used to shoplift for porno magazines all the time  Yes  No  That was the only thing I've ever  Oh no, there was two things I would shoplift 
[02:13:30]  It was the porno magazines and baseball cards  And I was the same age, by the way  Never, ever shoplifted porno  Because that's the double-edged sword  You get caught  You're not only caught shoplifting  You're caught  I had no other choice  I was underage  And I wanted to check out some porn  And where all the other underage kids did  Either your father's secret stash  Or you traipse around the woods  You know how valuable a brand new porn magazine was  In my neighborhood  Brand new, very  Instead of the old ones that were out in the rain 
[02:14:00]  For a month or two  I knew out on Long Island  The sticky pages  Yeah  But that's what we had  But if you went to your friends with a brand new one  I mean, you were in  We would go to the woods  And look for another neighborhood's fort  You know, whether it's a tree fort  Or an underground  Or whatever kind of fort  And take their stash  It was like young conquerors  We'd go by  And the booty would be porno magazines  And those are the ones  I remember seeing some old nasty ones  With those big thick pages  The glossy color pages 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It was usually a black and white magazine  But the middle five pages were color  And they were big, thick, nasty  Yeah  And if they were left out in the wrong climate  They would rip  And be all stuck together  I don't know if it was because people were using them  Or what  But it was very disappointing when that happened  But yeah, porno  Never steal porno  I always did  Would it modify if I got caught?  The Centerport stationery  Nah  Always  What I would do is I'd go in there 
[02:15:00]  And I was like, I don't know  Middle-aged man  Behind the counter  And I would stay in the store  Until he would walk  Somewhere else in the store  Yeah  Grab the magazine  Run  All the time  Now, you can't  If you get caught  There's too much of a risk  Now you're being caught for stealing  And you have porno  My dad worked at this place  And it was a law firm  And he took me into work one day  And the boss  Had a whole stack of Playboys  In the office  And I'm like  Oh 
[02:15:30]  So I go over  And I start thumbing through it  And my father sees  And thinks it's okay  You know, because I'm going through  Some of the articles  In the beginning  I'm not really just sitting there  Gawking at the picture  So I guess he thought it was cool  But every time  They left the room  I went right to the pictures  And he's like  Alright, come on  Let's go to lunch  I was like  Oh no  Now I can't stand up  I couldn't stand up  I was so embarrassed  And for me  It was like  Just the image in my head  From what I had seen  In the magazine  It wasn't going away 
[02:16:00]  Yeah  It was  So I did the hunchback walk  Where I'm constantly looking  Going  Maybe my shoelace is untied  Hold up  Pop  I go down  And it's like  Oh  I think I have some money  In my pocket  I'm walking with my hand  In my pocket  Hunched over  That's why  Belts were invented  What?  To hide the  Yeah  Strap it down  Anyway  Shoplifting story  I don't know  If you want to tell it now  He's so nervous  Jimmy  You're so silly  Well don't get into details  What? 
[02:16:30]  The Brinks heist  Was the ice involved in?  No, no  I'm not saying  There really isn't any specifics  Just picture any store  He's ever gone into  Half of it has walked out with him  He just pilfers things  You know what?  He's a great diversion  First of all  Wait, we've been shopping  With the ice though  We went for sportswear  He tells the people  That he's walking  See, he's different  We're to shoplifting  Most people will hide it  On their person  And walk out  Dice will tell the store manager  That he is not paying  For this, this, and this  And he'll walk right by it  But we saw him do it  With sweatshirts  Right on 57th there 
[02:17:00]  He thinks he's on the streets  Of the Budapest market though  He's like negotiating  And trying to  Trying to get the price down  On sweatshirts  He bought us  Some lovely  Everlast  Hooded black sweatshirts  That I have never worn  Never  And I told him  I'm like  I'm never wearing  Hey, a perfect planet  Is everyone dressed like Dice  He wanted us to  Yeah, he wanted us  To all wear them  Look, it's got the hood thing  In the pockets  You can touch hands 
[02:17:30]  He wanted us to be  Like the Dice gang  Yeah  We all walk around  In the Everlast black  Some will all walk  Sweatshirts, right  And I'm like  You know what Dice  And I'm pointing out  Something else  That I would wear  I'm like  If you want to buy me something  And it's obvious  He's going to buy you something  No matter what  I would like that sweatshirt up there  He's like  No, no  It's got to be the black hooded Everlast  Yeah, the bum sweatshirts  The B-U-M sweatshirts  And the Joey Butterfuco pants  Right  That's a good look for everybody  Kenny, these look good 
[02:18:00]  You look beautiful  Right  Handsome  We're going to walk down the street  And terrorize New York City now  So the whole shopping trip with Dice  Amounts to a distraction  That you could rob a bank  With this type of distraction  Kenny and Happy Face  Are putting on boxing gloves  Weren't there boxing gloves in there  And fighting each other  Yeah  And they're pushing each other  And the manager's just looking around  Like, what's happening  And Dice, meanwhile  Is just loading up on stuff  That he brings to the register  And goes  Okay 
[02:18:30]  I'm paying this price  For these three  Right  And the guy goes  No, it's this price  Each one  And then  It don't work that way  This is the God  Work with me  Right  Work with me  And then apparently  From what Jim says  He also  You know how he gets away with it  He buys enough stuff  In the store  That they're like  Well, okay  Oh, he's spending a lot of money  But he's getting twice as much merchandise  Out the door with it  Because he's Dice  They're intimidated  Right  They don't come off like dicks  All he has to hear is  Hey, I'm a big fan  Cha-ching 
[02:19:00]  He's walking out with half the store  I'm not paying for this  He just throws stuff in the bag  I've watched him do this  In every city we've ever worked  And he's just putting stuff in the bag  Talking to the guy  And the guy doesn't have the nerves  Go  Are you stealing that?  Are you doing  Is Dice stealing this?  Yeah, because I don't think  He officially steals  Because if you're doing it  Right in front of the person  They see you  Yeah  I don't think it's stealing  Because that person  Has the opportunity to tell you  Hey, you can't do that  It's been handled  But they don't speak up  That's what he says a lot  It's been handled  It's been handled  No, we were in here  And the other guy  He said just to put it in 
[02:19:30]  The other guy  I saw the other guy  All right, open the register  Put the bills in this bag  No, it's not a robbery  It's, you know  It's the other guy  And I'm just taking care of this  No, Dice  You're robbing me  Yeah  I don't have a gun  He got a video camera in LA  Probably for half what  He should have paid for it  And one of the lines  He used on the guy  To get it for free  He's just talking and talking  He's like, come on  I drive by here every day  I'm always thinking about you guys  That is a great line 
[02:20:00]  But I saw him work the same way  He's like, well, do something for me  The pro deal  He wants the pro deal  Yeah, yeah  I want the pro deal  And then he mentions people  You know, all right  Let's say  Let's say the president came in  He's paying the same price  You're a fan of mine  And then they  Actually, he works it  And they give him the cut rates  That's where you can tell  That he's really not Italian  That's when you know 
[02:20:30]  Dice's ethnic background  Is indeed Jewish  I watched him in Vegas  In the Vegas airport  Get on his knees  And beg for something for free  Just to make me laugh  But it was just to make  And he's like, please give me something for free  For the love of God  And he's on his hands and knees  I'm begging you  What more do you want from me?  And I'm laughing, of course  Of course  And everybody's embarrassed for him  They're like, oh, I can't  Please give me something for free  Please  He's a funny guy  We walked out of that store 
[02:21:00]  With all kinds of stuff  And I don't even think he paid  120 bucks for about  300, 400 dollars worth of merchandise  Right  And taxing  Merchandise  That's why it's called merchandise  It's half mine  So I should get the Dice part  Off of the merchant  I pay merchant price  Everyone else merchandise  I'm Dice  All right, Dice  Well, you know  Just to get you out of the up and store  We saw him in action  It was an amazing thing 
[02:21:30]  It was amazing  Let's get her all on mic  Earl  How you doing, Earl?  Earl  What's happening, man?

[02:29:30]  Once again, I want to thank the whole gang  From WBCN for treating us really  Really well  As always  Too well  I mean, the Ritz-Carlton was way too much  Yeah, I don't know how they spun that one  How they figured out to do that one  Because that hotel  Beautiful  Spectacular  Better than the one where you usually stay in  Which is the hotel we were fired in  Right  Up here in Boston  So like I said, that little joke, I guess, has run its course  Can I talk to Earl again? 
[02:30:00]  Earl  Just get on mic, Earl  Earl  Earl  Earl  How did you do, Earl?  Earl, I just want to let you know that  You were right  Oh my god  Oh no  Oh man  Well, people on the instant feedback on the internet  They were wondering  So there you go  Earl, how did  You all rot in the hill  How did that feel, Earl? 
[02:30:30]  Rot  When that beer bottle  Let's just say  When the beer bottle disappeared, right?  And then reappeared  And she took a drink from it  And then spit it into your mouth  Earl, how did that make you feel?  Because you were actually  I had a great view of it  From where I'm sitting  Earl was hitting her in the head  With his microphone  He was hitting her in the head  And she then spit the beer out into your mouth  Which I spit right back at  I think I'd rather have a dirty bomb go off in my mouth 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, that was something  I've seen little kids happier to eat asparagus  Yeah  Evil men  And that stain on the back of your shirt will never wash out  How can you tell, though?  He's wearing black  Someone put two slugs on the back of your shirt  Turn around, Earl  Let me stay  Turn around  Turn around  Turn around more  No, just turn around  Oh, God 
[02:31:30]  Yeah  Yeah, you should leave  That's good  You should leave that shirt behind  I love this shirt  It was either her  Or somebody poured salt on a slug on your shirt  Ugh  All right  Well, we've got to get out of here  We can't play what we learned  Because we can't figure out  How to print up anything around here  I learned what Dice says when he shoplifts  Yeah  Bop, now it's mine  Now it's mine  And then there's nothing they can do about it  All right  Well, we've got to hit the road  Yes  We've got to get back to New York City  We'll get ready 
[02:32:00]  Get back to a New York show tomorrow  Ladies  Wow contest has begun  We want some ladies to show up tomorrow  Please, okay?  Mm-hmm  Also, tomorrow on the show, we've got  What happened?  What?  They're leaving now  The girls haven't left the building yet  Is there a back entrance?  I didn't say nothing  I got enough hate mail  I didn't say nothing  But I'll be logic  No, it was you, Jim  No, it wasn't  Because I think they're hot  It was Earl 
[02:32:30]  I said  You don't say anything  Anyway  Lady Di will be back on the program tomorrow  She's trying to figure out what she can do  To save herself as far as this show goes  She wants to serenade Jim Norton  After she gets all dressed up in a gown  And has a new hairdo  Yeah, she's going to go to the parlor  I'd rather run that beer bottle under my nose  And not want to be serenaded  By that fat, straight-toothed monstrosity  Rick, what else do we got for tomorrow?  This is called filler at the biz 
[02:33:00]  We're just kind of filling to $6.50  You stretch  Because we can't play, what do we learn?  We don't know what's going on tomorrow yet?  Oh, man  I am so sick of winging this goddamn radio show  Day after day, we just wing it  Wing it  And for some reason it works  I don't know how that happens  But yeah  We did some good things today  I'm going through instant feedback  But people seem to have forgot the concept of  What did we learn?  Oh, really?  Yeah  All right  They're not helping us open  All right, I guess this is how we end  Until tomorrow 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, we'll be back home tomorrow  In our own studios  Oh, boy, it's 6.49  Jeez, what do we do?  What do we got, another minute?  Oh, my God  At least we just have to struggle through a minute  Not an hour and a half like we did Friday with Dustin  Oh, God, 6.50  Is that it?  Are we off?  That ought to hold the little f***ers for a while  Earl, a final thought?  Did you have fun here in Boston?  I had a blast in Boston  Yeah  You were much more animated this time around  Did you enjoy seeing all the white people? 
[02:34:00]  You truly saw White America  Yes, I did  As Eminem sings on his latest CD  When Public Enemy showed up  Like that whole crew  And them and the Outkast crew showed up  They would just look at me like  Hey, thanks, Earl  It's 6.50  See you tomorrow  Aw, my God  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you </pre>
