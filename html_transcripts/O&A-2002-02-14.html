<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a Valentine's Day theme, focusing on the absurdity of gift-giving and relationships. Opie and Anthony shared their own experiences, contrasting Opie's simple postcard with Anthony's elaborate Valentine's Day card.  Listener calls followed, detailing humorous and often vulgar relationship anecdotes, including finding a size 13 basketball shoe in a girlfriend's car and receiving a breakup card on Valentine's Day.  Inappropriate gifts, like gorilla suits and massage kits, were discussed, alongside alternative gift strategies such as Hawaiian flowers and cash. The "55-gallon drum challenge" was mentioned, along with a Naughty Nineties photo shoot. The segment also included analysis of a radio article mocking attempts by other radio stations to compete with Opie and Anthony, which the hosts found amusing and poorly written.

The show then transitioned to a segment focused on the hosts' reactions to competing radio stations' strategies. They derisively referred to program directors as "pussies" and "douchebags," mocking their attempts to counter-program, citing low ratings and a lack of originality.  The phrase "stick to their knitting" was repeatedly used to dismiss music-only programming.  The hosts discussed a listener who dumped coal at a rival station's parking lot, a station's attempt to hire them, and the perceived delusions of some program directors. Callers shared anecdotes about various stations and the hosts' impact, including one caller who described a station playing the same 20 songs repeatedly. This segment included further discussion of Valentine’s Day messages from newspapers, listener calls, and the ongoing "55-gallon drum challenge," interspersed with a vulgar Valentine's Day poem dedicated to Opie's wife.  Kylie, a caller interested in the 55-gallon drum challenge, had her plans rejected.  Vulgarity, sexually suggestive comments, and offensive jokes peppered this segment.

A subsequent segment featured Patty, a regular caller, gifting liquor-filled chocolates which were thrown around the studio.  This transitioned into a discussion about Patty's loneliness and a darkly comedic hypothetical end to her Valentine's Day.  A phone call with Daniela, a Penthouse Pet of the Month from Amsterdam and strip club worker, followed, involving sexually explicit conversation about her body, work, and sexual practices. Daniela played a game, identifying aspects of the show, with the conversation often becoming sexually suggestive. She even showered while still on the phone, leading to more sexually suggestive conversation and concerns about water damage. This was followed by a caller performing a "going crazy" bit, yelling "bang," which other callers replicated.  This was interspersed with a discussion of a man committing multiple hit and runs. A new radio bit, the "bang, bang, bang" segment, was introduced with live caller participation. The segment concluded with Sandy Kane, a former stripper, and Dr. Katz, a dentist, who examined Sandy's breath and a large genital wart ("Twato"), painted red in the shape of a heart for Valentine’s Day.  Crude jokes and sexually suggestive commentary were prevalent.

The show continued with a segment featuring Dr. Josh Katz and his "helimiter" breath-measuring device.  The hosts and callers, including Sandy, were tested. Sandy’s history of bad breath affecting her personal life was a recurring theme, along with numerous crude jokes and sexual innuendo.  Listener calls contributed more off-color commentary and jokes.  The show promoted Jim Norton's tour, the 55-gallon drum challenge, and TheraBreath. Sandy performed a song with sexually explicit lyrics.  The broadcast also included unrelated listener calls and more crude jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  There will always be retarded idiots to entertain us with their stupidity.  Mindless, Opie, crotch-grabbing Anthony.  Mindless, Opie, crotch-grabbing Anthony.  People grabbing their crotches and saying, suck it, Opie and Anthony show.  Suck it.  Love the show.  Mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless.  Woo! Woo! Woo!  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  Hello.  Happy Valentine's Day to you and everyone out there.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Happy Valentine's Day.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, give us a call.  866-2774.  Wow.  So this is, um...  Anywhere else, including Phoenix.  866-2774.  Wow.  Some people apparently think we're on in Phoenix. 
[00:01:00]  Ah!  There you go.  Phoenix checking in, Anthony.  Phoenix.  Phoenix, Arizona?  Yes.  Rich, what's going on?  Oh, not that much.  Man, I am so sick and tired of seeing these people on the street selling these flowers and these candies for their girlfriends and their wives.  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  I am just sick of this.  All right.  My ex-girlfriend, basically, I buy tickets to go out and see her.  I'm in D.C.  She's out in Kansas.  Wow. 
[00:01:30]  And I'm going to see her.  I'm seeing her in like six months because I'm in the military.  Uh-oh.  Right?  I call her up and say, baby, I'm on the way.  She said, don't come.  I am a bitter bastard right now.  Oh, boy.  She told you that's it, huh?  She said, that's it.  I mean, I've been gone.  I've been overseas.  I've been trying to do my thing.  God, I need to get hooked up with one of the naughty nineties.  I'm telling you.  Hey, you know, Rich, you've got to face the fact she's banging someone else.  Yeah, that's what it is.  I hope that degenerate bitch gets genital warts down her throat. 
[00:02:00]  I am just sick.  I had a girl once that went to college and actually told me, hey, when you come here to  visit me at college, could you just give me a call before you're going to shut up?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  I'll call you.  I have one of those girlfriends, too.  Did you?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What a tool.  I would go to Boston to visit her from time to time, and she was living in Cape Cod,  and she would meet me in Boston. 
[00:02:30]  I was coming from Rochester.  Oh, man.  And I found, she used to say the same thing, call before you show up, and she comes and  gets me, and I find a size 13 basketball shoes.  Uh-oh.  That ain't a good sign.  In the back seat.  What's up?  Oh, naughty.  She forgot to clean out the back seat before she picked me up.  Did she turn into a size 13 also?  Oh, my God. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  You know something?  We actually have audio of the guy that she was with, Obie.  I'm Big Dick Black.  So, Adam.  Yeah.  Coming from high.  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  I appreciate it.  You guys are great.  Norman Rolls.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  Yeah, I was seeing this girl, and she was going to Dowling College right there on Long  Island.  And I just figured I'd show up and surprise her.  Nothing was going on at that time.  But I showed up, and she's like, oh, hey.  Hey, you know, next time, could you call before you just pop in? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, okay.  Okay, I'll call.  I'll make a phone call.  Because you're thinking, you know, she wants to make it a little special.  Maybe a home-cooked meal or something.  Yeah, that must be it.  And she needs time to go to the supermarket, get all the ingredients, right?  Maybe shop for a nice bottle of wine.  Yeah.  A bottle of champagne.  Could you call before?  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  There it is. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  That is so lame.  Rick and I were comparing our Valentine's Day cards.  You guys are brutal with each other, man.  You guys went complete different routes with your cards.  Now, Valentine's Day, he starts.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me just say this right off the bat.  Linda, if you're listening, turn off the radio. 
[00:04:30]  I'm warning you now.  Sandy, if you're listening to the radio, turn the goddamn radio off now.  Because I need to make fun of Rick, and he needs to make fun of me.  All right.  So, I came to work, and I was all excited.  I got my, you know, my gift and card taken care of.  Uh-huh.  Which is a big relief.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Oh, it's a major relief, because you're stressed out.  You don't know what to do.  No.  You know, because everyone has made it uncool to get the heart-shaped box filled with chocolate. 
[00:05:00]  The brass.  Remember the days when that was cool enough?  You get a little card, and then the heart-shaped box, everyone's happy.  With the red cellophane wrapped on it, you could pick it up at any CVS or 7-Eleven.  Well, that's not good enough.  7-Eleven.  That's not good enough anymore, and the ladies know it.  You come home with that, they're like, oh, you don't care too much about me, do you?  Uh-huh.  Well, I'll tell you another thing that's not cool on Valentine's Day anymore is the dozen roses.  Now, you have to fancy up the flowers.  How's that?  Because for some reason, the woman doesn't think you're trying hard enough. 
[00:05:30]  With just a dozen roses.  Right.  What do you mean, like two or three?  I personally think it's fine, but no, you need to, I don't know, they have to be different  color roses.  They have to have this and that.  Where's the baby's breath around it?  I need the baby's breath.  Because if you just bring home a dozen roses, you know, oh, yeah, you bought it from the  guy at Penn Station, didn't you?  Exactly.  How much thought did you put into it before you bought it?  None more thought.  So, it's kind of stressful.  What do you do?  What do you do? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Do you buy the balloon on the straw?  The little Mylar heart balloon on the straw?  Did you do that, fella?  Do you buy that?  Did you do that with the big I love you on it?  I love ya.  You don't know what to do.  Right.  Very stressful.  I'm in.  I figured it out this year.  You figured it out?  I'm so in.  It's not even funny.  There you go.  So, then I go into the office and Rick's all excited, too.  So, we're comparing boxes, where each one got the gift from. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, they're comparing packaging.  Right.  I don't even know what the gifts are, but they're arguing over the packaging and the name on  the package, and who's going to be more impressed?  Because Ope walks in, he kicks up his feet, he's like, ah, throws his hands behind his head,  he's like, I'm in.  I am in.  Another year, I don't have to get engaged, thank God.  Ah, so it wasn't an engagement ring.  No, my brother did that, and totally effed up this Valentine's Day, by the way.  He did?  We'll talk about that some other day.  Holy jeez. 
[00:07:00]  Which one?  Yeah, to my family, because they all listen all over the place.  Who did?  Quinn got engaged.  Quinn got engaged?  Yeah.  Holy smoke.  It just effed up my world.  Oh, congratulations.  Someone in my house has been crying for two weeks.  I thought it was over happiness, but I soon learned it wasn't over happiness.  And it ain't the cat, huh?  No.  And he thinks his gift is going to save him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it'll save.  It'll save the Valentine's Day.  Give me one line. 
[00:07:30]  Give me one line.  What are you saying?  That like...  Huh?  Give me one line that Sandy said to you that was like, okay, she's kind of upset that I  didn't get her an engagement ring.  Well, my brother warned me like three weeks ago.  That he was going to do it.  So I was able to get the preemptive strike going.  It softened up the beaches.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you better believe it.  You better believe it.  Really?  He gave me time.  Because he's been going out with his lovely lady almost the same amount of time I've been 
[00:08:00]  with Sandy.  Right.  So like the families, they're wandering here.  Oh, oh.  And he beat me to the punch and so now I'm screwed.  But he gave me three weeks to kind of soften the beaches, man.  Oh, man.  How uncomfortable is it when your brother's fiance now shows Sandy the ring?  Oh, that happens tonight, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I just got an email from my brother.  Sandy, look.  Yeah, perfect timing.  Show her on Valentine's Day. 
[00:08:30]  Good job, guys.  Good job.  Oh, my God.  Good job.  Look at my ring.  Oh, my God.  So we started comparing the cards we got.  Me and Rick.  And Rick, Linda, turn off the radio.  I'll give her one more chance.  Well, there are a lot of different types of cards out there, Hopi.  Rick.  Right, but now my section has vastly been narrowed because of my situation. 
[00:09:00]  He's backpedaling now.  No, I'm not backpedaling.  That's a backpedaling.  No, it's not a backpedal.  I was kind of on your side.  I thought you were so confident about it.  I am confident.  About the card you got.  Now you're saying the selection wasn't as bad.  I am supremely confident my card is great.  The selection in the card stores are, it's brutal at this point.  Yeah, really bad.  It's brutal.  But not everybody makes my type of card, so I got to go to the special section.  The special?  So what's the special section?  The wife section. 
[00:09:30]  Well, that's a huge section on Valentine's Day.  As huge as his card?  It's not that big, you dick.  Yeah, the next size bigger is the employee leaving card that everyone has to sign.  Your card is huge.  Sorry to see you go.  Big cardboard thing weighs two pounds.  Rick's card.  Linda, I told you to turn off the radio.  Linda's card is huge.  It's not that big.  It's one of those big, multi-layered ones. 
[00:10:00]  It's a little smaller than a...  It's four pages.  There's some nice wording in there.  And with the cutout front.  Right.  The textured cover.  And the big paper inside.  With the raised flower tissue paper.  With a big, to my loving wife.  To my loving wife in huge letters.  Which, even when I saw it when you showed me, I almost vomited.  Yeah, but that's because of your situation.  I know.  And then inside is someone else's words.  Pretty much trying to tell you how you feel. 
[00:10:30]  About three paragraphs worth.  Oh, well then let's talk about Opie's postcard that he got.  Shelling out 85 cents for his eight-year-long girlfriend.  No, $2.11.  Wow, two bucks.  $2.11.  Does that include the stamp you're going to use to send it to her?  It was a fine little...  Well, I'm not going to see her this Valentine's Day.  Four by six...  His?  ...card.  It's like an index card.  And it has a picture on the front. 
[00:11:00]  Of two little kids.  You tool.  A boy, a little boy and a little girl running on a hillside.  In the...  Hand in hand.  In the high wheat.  Representing the youthful...  The numerous.  ...abandoned and lust and love that they have in their relationship.  And understands my card right away.  With not much writing inside.  Because you know why?  I'm going to write a little something myself for my own brain.  Because you don't have that much to say.  You can't have that much in there.  I have a whole section on my card where I can write something to her. 
[00:11:30]  There's no room for you to write anything personal in your card.  There is plenty of room for me to write, love me.  That's it.  That's all I need.  Everything else is written.  Do you put M-E or do you put your name?  No.  They just don't...  Love me.  Coffee, tea, or me?  No.  That's great.  Well, see, there are two different styles of card that I'm sure your ladies will love equally.  I went simple and to the point. 
[00:12:00]  With kind of a visual thing that means a lot.  Right.  The first thing you saw, you grabbed.  No.  No.  No.  No.  The opening by the cards where there wasn't so many people standing?  It was a nightmare.  I hate this because you look at people and you look at people buying cards and go,  shut up.  You beat your women.  I can tell just by looking at you.  You beat your women.  And this guy's got five of them.  He's like picking out cards for five chicks.  Just awful.  Then you get the opening at the card section and you see which cards are there. 
[00:12:30]  The ones that no one's getting.  It's the ones, I'm so sorry about what happened.  Hopefully, this Valentine's Day we can put it behind us.  I'm sorry.  But you've got to start out with, I'm sorry, bad.  Then there's another one, fight cards, where they've had a fight and they want to make up.  And then I read one that was so sad.  It was like, I know the past.  I know that our life together hasn't been the easiest, but hopefully the future will bring 
[00:13:00]  more happiness.  It's like...  My card doesn't say it.  Shut up, you ass.  Are you implying that was Rick's card?  I didn't say that.  Because that is the worst card ever.  It's like, yeah, our life together has been real crap, but stick with me.  I hope it'll get better.  It's like awful, man.  Basically saying, I'll try not to hit you anymore.  Yeah.  How about...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the...  I'm sorry I hit you again.  Please don't go to the shelter.  It won't happen again.  Until next week.  But do the dishes. 
[00:13:30]  Do the dishes, you effing bitch.  Hi.  Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  Okay.  Harry, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, Oda?  Hey.  Yeah, I wonder if they put love forever in the card, but I got to give you a little tip  on what type of flowers to get instead of roses.  All right.  There's a place, and I'm not going to say the name because of your own thing there, but  it's Hawaiian flowers.  Oh, what?  Like orchids and whatnot? 
[00:14:00]  They're flowers that are only grown in Hawaii, and you have them sent whatever day you want.  Cheaper than roses, but much, much more elegant than roses.  How about that?  See, and I bet your lady appreciates that because it came from Hawaii.  And not the guy selling flowers at Penn Station.  No, no, no.  Because the ladies can tell these days, I'm telling you.  The office where they got delivered, every girl was like very, very, very impressed.  She said, Harry, she says, you got gold stars from everybody.  There you go. 
[00:14:30]  All right, Harry.  Talk to you later.  There you go.  No, he sent flowers.  He knew he had it.  If he was going to send flowers, he better send it from a faraway place.  A faraway land.  Dave, what's up?  Boys, what's happening today?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Okay.  Four years ago was my fiancés and mine, our first Valentine's Day.  So I want to do something different.  So I rented a gorilla suit and got a dozen roses, and I got in cahoots with her boss on this.  Wacky alert.  Yeah.  A gorilla suit. 
[00:15:00]  She had no idea it was coming.  Thought I was, like, doing an apology poem for her boss.  Uh-huh.  But the minute I pulled off the mask, all blood rushed out of her head, and she just, like, fell down on her desk.  Bum, bum, ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Da-na-na-na-na.  Let's see this next clip, Dick.  Well, you've got to go above and beyond sometimes.  A classic.  All right, Dave. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, the guy's trying it.  Right.  He's trying to spice it up a little bit.  Instead of the Brax chocolate.  Brax.  Brax.  When you get that box, that big, that little box covered in the red cellophane, if you're any older than in the fifth or sixth grade where that was something you got your little girl and you're getting that, man.  Hey, man, there was a time when that's all you needed to do, though.  I'm telling you.  Well, at least the big box of candy.  You know what I mean?  And, boy, the fat chicks will appreciate that, right?  You get them the big box of candy. 
[00:16:00]  It's a permission slip to get fatter.  You've just given her a permission slip to tack on some more weight.  There was also a time when all you needed was a six-pack and a trip to White Castle as well.  Times have changed.  Crack.  That'll get the chick.  Times have changed.  I remember the simpler times, Anthony.  Yes.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  All right.  I'm from East Siakam.  I'm catching you on 107.1 out of Columbus. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  The Bayouazzo.  We're doing a little business to put you in with me.  The Bayouazzo.  The Bayouazzo.  Hey, my wife's letting me up the hook.  She's into the new green roses.  You know the ones called Benjamin Franklin?  Ah, money.  The green roses.  The green roses.  The green roses.  It's the best in the world.  I don't even have to think about it anymore.  You just give her cold, hard cash.  Well, that's part of Opie's card.  He's got the little money holder thing in here. 
[00:17:00]  He just pays her up.  Is there a money holder with the face of the president in there?  That's all right.  It's got to be a penny, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Hey, thanks, guys.  There he goes.  He goes cold, hard cash.  Brother Joe wants in on this?  All right.  Oh, boy.  Brother Joe, what's up?  Another bitter son of a bitch.  Guys, no, I swear to God, man, I have never bought a Valentine's Day card in my life, and  I never caught grief for it, and let me tell you why.  We've always had, Anthony and I have always had our sister Dawn, who either worked at Vicki's 
[00:17:30]  or at Fredericks of Hollywood.  That's right.  I totally forgot about this.  But, like, this year at Bath and Body Works, I picked up a lovely massage kit with massage  oils, and I'm going to take her to dinner.  That's it.  I'm going to dinner.  I'm getting some sushi.  Who, Dawn?  I'm going to massage the hell.  Oh, shut up.  You sick bastard.  You're a sick bastard.  But I've never bought a card.  Cards are waste, man.  Cards are always like a waste. 
[00:18:00]  And the girls don't, I don't know, they don't really appreciate cards, I don't think.  Well, some of them do.  But, you know, for the most part, if you're just getting a card, maybe you're in trouble.  You've got to get, no, you've got to hit them with that Barry White stuff, man.  You've got to tell them all those things that you've got those people writing those cards.  Junkmail Jerry writes, why does Opie's card sound like one of those summer's eve?  And he's a douche.  Premixed, pre-measured, disposable card. 
[00:18:30]  Hi, Joe.  All right, fellas.  Talk to you later.  Later, man.  Hey, Rick, you put yourself in the barrel today, by the way.  Someone's saying, Joey from Hoboken, dude, isolate the clip of Rick saying, it's not that big.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  What's going on, Odie?  All right.  Yo, you guys talking about giving a call to your girlfriend right before you get to her at a place?  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, it's just like that.  I'm here on Long Island.  I go to Hofstra.  I got a girl up in New Paltz.  And I was supposed to go up there this weekend, going to see Weezer, actually, up in Albany.  And she said, before you get here, give me a call.  I know what she's doing.  Oh, boy.  Getting D and the A.  I mean, another little thing.  I got an observation for you.  Yeah.  I was at school today.  And any of those single ladies, they are all over the single guys.  All they look for on Valentine's Day is some C.  There's no two ways about it. 
[00:19:30]  They can see everyone getting matched up.  And they just want it.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Want the big C.  Well, guys.  Well, thank you, Mike.  Thank you, Mike.  Get back to class.  See you later, boys.  All right.  There he goes.  Jeez.  You should have bailed out.  Let's go to Travis.  Travis, what's up?  Yo, Ope.  Yeah.  Did I hear this correctly?  You and Rick were comparing each other's packages?  Nothing gets past these bastards.  I mean, I don't want to fake it. 
[00:20:00]  What are you doing?  Very good.  Most girls love cards.  All right, Travis.  I like them, but I like what's personally written inside a lot more.  See?  You know, you can't get...  What's the matter, Norton?  You've been pretty quiet on this whole subject.  What about Valentine's Day and Jim Norton?  Do you get cards?  Yeah.  Do you get...  Yes.  Do you, really?  Of course you have to.  You're being serious.  Yeah, you have to.  Okay.  You have to.  So it's an obligation.  What kind of cards did you get?  What kind of card?  Well, just, you know, whatever the thing, the occasion, you know, with the little heart 
[00:20:30]  on it and...  Little heart on it?  It?  Yeah.  Heart.  Heart.  Little heart on it?  Okay.  I misunderstood.  I thought you presented...  Don't jump down there, Mr. Falwell.  I thought you presented your card in a different fashion.  I don't know.  All right.  I'm not...  I'll tell you what I'm not into.  I'm not into the themed Valentine's Day cards.  You know what?  I'm not into the big heart-shaped card.  I'm not into the happy Valentine's Day card.  I just get cards that pretty much look like sixth grade going steady cards. 
[00:21:00]  From the section way away from the standard cards.  A lot more fun that way.  All right.  A little more personal.  A little more fun.  A little more personal.  Let's go to Eric from Philly.  Eric, what's up?  Yo, what's up, Owen A?  Hey.  Yo, I got a bitches that'll get you today.  All right, go ahead.  I woke up this morning, sitting on my kitchen table, is a card from my girlfriend, and there's 
[00:21:30]  pictures in there of her with another guy, and it says, don't need you in my life.  I've got someone better.  That's what you got for Valentine's Day?  That's what I got for Valentine's Day.  Hey, that rocks.  Wow.  That rocks.  You must really be a bad boyfriend.  Yeah, what do you do to her, man?  I didn't do nothing to her, man.  Everything's been going great.  Last night, she was all happy.  Everything's good.  I went out.  I spent $150 on a nice bracelet. 
[00:22:00]  She was happy because she knew she was leaving.  Oh.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, sucks to be you, bro.  Yeah, man.  All right, Eric.  Take care, guys.  There he goes.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason, what's up?  Jason, go.  Yo, what's going on?  Hey, man.  This is funny.  Go.  I just want you to know I feel bad for you about your last-minute card ticket.  No, I did okay.  I'm very happy with my selection.  I picked out a card for my wife.  You know, I opened it up.  It sounded real nice.  Put it in the envelope. 
[00:22:30]  Licked the clothes.  I gave it to her.  Me, I didn't know there was two black people on the cover.  It'd be great if I was black, but I'm white.  The Ebony collection.  You just quickly looked at the card?  That's funny.  You quickly looked at the card, like, okay, this will do.  But in the envelope, and you didn't look close enough.  I've done that before on purpose.  You didn't even look at the cover.  I like the fuzzy picture of the, like, 70s black couple on the cover where he's holding  a hand.  Yeah, big afros, and they're smiling.  And I just write it there, hey, baby, or something, you know. 
[00:23:00]  And every one of those cards starts off with, now that I'm paroled.  I appreciate it.  You guys rock.  All right, Jason.  That's funny.  Mona, it looks like.  Mona?  Mona.  Mona, what's up?  Nothing.  I wanted to share a story with you guys.  Hey, you're a fine African princess, aren't you?  No, I'm not.  No, she's not.  She's Hispanic.  You're Hispanic?  No.  No, I'm not Hispanic.  You're Italian.  No, I'm not Italian.  You're not black. 
[00:23:30]  No, I'm white.  You're a Wigur.  I swear to God.  Oh, I'm not.  What's your nationality?  My nationality?  Let's see.  All of them?  Yeah.  Irish, Scottish, Swedish, French, German, Native American, and Moorish.  Oh, Native American.  But it's not that much of me.  So you're trying to profile, by the way she sounds on the phone, and it didn't work, did  it?  We usually do well with that.  All right, Mona, go ahead.  Okay.  I wanted to share a story with you guys, what one of my exes did with a Valentine's Day gift. 
[00:24:00]  He handed me this little red gift bag, right?  And I'm a big girl, you know?  Oh, so you date black guys.  I have, yeah.  How big are you?  How big are you?  Let me finish my story.  Well, we need to visualize, because it's a radio show.  How big are you?  Okay, I'm very fluffy.  Fluffy?  Yeah, I'm fluffy.  Are you over 200 pounds?  Yes.  How big a circus animal are you?  Very funny. 
[00:24:30]  How much do you weigh?  How much do I weigh?  Yeah.  250.  250.  250.  250.  250.  250.  And you know what 250 means, Opie?  Huh?  280.  Yeah, that's the radio mask right there.  All right, Mornin, let's go.  Okay.  So I opened up the bag, and it's one of those little cartoons.  You remember those little cartoon things that you get in, like, elementary school or whatever?  Yeah.  Sure.  It had an elephant on the front of it.  I was like, you know, that's too much. 
[00:25:00]  Did he do it on purpose?  I don't think so, because, I mean, you know, obviously he liked big girls if he was with me, so.  I guess so.  I don't know, but I just thought I'd share that with y'all.  That's classic.  All right, Mornin, thank you.  You're welcome.  All right, there she goes.  Santa from Manhattan says, she said Moorish.  That means African.  Oh, really?  I guess so.  Joe, what's going on?  She didn't want to confess.  Hey.  I want to know how you guys are signing your cards.  You putting a little XO, XO, and a little kissy heart on the bottom? 
[00:25:30]  XO, XO, XO.  Hard, hard, hard.  What's up to you?  I'm more the smiley face sideways type of guy.  Number four EBA.  I do a little LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  That's a thing.  R-A-L-F.  All right, Joe.  R-A-L-F.  Rolling on the floor, laughing my ass off.  LOL. 
[00:26:00]  LOL.  Kevin's got something.  Kevin, what's up?  What's going on, gentlemen?  Hey.  Listen, I got the cure for the cheap Valentine's Day.  All right.  Date the Third World Nation girls.  That's what it is.  My girlfriend's from a Mecca, Mecca, Mexico.  It's like this little nothing town.  Throw a card and chocolate that I am in like Flynn.  Nice.  Nothing wrong with that.  So get the girls that expect nothing.  Yeah, like the housekeeping girls, you know?  My girlfriend's nothing great.  You know what? 
[00:26:30]  That's it.  That's good.  I go home, dinner is on the table every day, the house is clean, and I'm a happy man.  Can't have a conversation with her, but everything else is good in your life.  That's it.  Nothing wrong with that, guys.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  All right.  XO, XO, guys.  All right.  Later.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break here.  A couple new clips on FoundryMusic.com.  He finally got a clip of one of the Mardi Gras fights.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's finally up on FoundryMusic.com.  If you want to check that out today, okay?  And I guess Rick did an after-hours, Naughty Nighty photo shoot. 
[00:27:00]  What?  Oh, yeah, that.  Yeah, I showed you guys a quick pic, so when we got down to...  He's talking about a video clip.  All right.  Well, Steve videotaped the whole thing.  Two girls going at it on the lesbian couch, right?  It was just the photo shoot.  All right.  Well, it sounds like it's some good video.  So go to FoundryMusic.com and check out two girls doing it up on the lesbian couch and  a nice fight from Mardi Gras.  Great.  A white guy just getting his ass kicked. 
[00:27:30]  But he did okay in the end.  He did?  Remember?  Yeah.  I wonder if that's on the tape, though.  Yeah.  Well, we'll check it out because we haven't even seen it.  Cool.  And big article.  Hit all the radio stations today, Anthony.  A big article.  Yeah, yeah.  Big article.  We'll talk about it next.  Made the front page of one of the RAG magazines.  A huge article on you and I.  How to compete against Opie and Anthony in your market.  It's a little thing that the radio stations have to do. 
[00:28:00]  Programmers mull the impact of Opie and Anthony.  They mull it.  They mull it over.  All right.  A lot of stupid ideas in there.  Bunch of idiots.  And more of your phone calls, so stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Here is where we really separate the champions from the chumps. 
[00:28:30]  God, that's horrible.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  And EW.  Now I'll be having fun.  Now I'll be having fun.  Yes, I'll be.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  No one will be getting married on our show for Valentine's Day.  Stupid Valentine's Day radio promotion. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, I'll be, buddy.  We're going to marry a hundred couples this Friday.  Oh, God.  The hack.  It's all part of our Valentine's Day celebration.  All week long.  We're calling it Valentine's Week.  We're going to be marrying off couples on our show.  Going to bring in a minister, a justice of the peace.  Hey, for Valentine's Day, I'm breaking up with my chick. 
[00:29:30]  Rock hole.  I'm getting married.  Didn't he do the fake marriage?  Yeah, he did that last year, I guess, for Valentine's Day.  Hey, I'm inviting all my listeners to my wedding and my bachelor party.  Yeah.  What a fake.  It's like, uh-oh, what's going to happen?  I'm leaving her at the altar.  Oh, who saw that coming?  You know what you guys should do?  You do like, you have little guys call up and bring up with their girlfriends and call 
[00:30:00]  it the Valentine's Day massacre.  Oh!  Hey, I kind of like that one, actually.  See, I'm show prepping.  And then another station was doing the Valentine's Day kiss contest.  Oh, what is that?  Get a bunch of couples in a mall and they have to lip lock.  Oh.  And they have to stay lip lock.  Oh, is that it?  And the couple that lasts the longest?  Kiss Marathon.  Wins a car or something. 
[00:30:30]  How about that?  Or how about just play love songs?  Nothing but love songs.  Or how about you get a couple and the guy who can knock the most teeth out of his girlfriend's mouth.  One punch.  One punch though, yeah.  You get one shot at it.  Mary Beth, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  My husband just called me to tell me, oh yeah, did you send my mom a card for Valentine's  Day?  Oh boy.  And by the way, why don't you pick yourself up some flowers? 
[00:31:00]  Because I don't think I'm going to be able to get to a store before it closes.  And I'll give you the money when I get home.  Your husband said that to you?  Good for him.  Wow.  Wow.  Sounds like he's married.  Wow.  I said, you know, I don't think it really matters that much.  Well, what is he doing right now?  He's working.  What are you doing?  I'm driving my brand new $30,000 car.  Are you working?  No.  Go out and do what he said.  Go send the mother the card and go fetch the flowers.  Wow.  Go send the mother the flowers.  He's working.  I don't care about Valentine's Day.  He's working. 
[00:31:30]  You're driving the new car.  Go out and just go out and get them.  You know what?  I felt kind of bad for Mary Beth.  I don't at all.  I'm eight months pregnant.  He should be going out and getting you flowers.  Good for you.  And then get home and clean the house and make sure that the baby is ready.  Hold on, Jim.  Now you've got to feel bad for her.  She's eight months pregnant there.  And he's out there probably working two jobs to make sure that her and the baby.  Which is nice.  If she's driving around a brand new $30,000 car, he's not working two jobs.  You're right.  I hate him.  Have sex with a Negro.  He's got one of those.  He's got one of those.  I'm not allowed to have sex.  I'm not allowed to have sex.  Why?  Because I'm pregnant and I have stuff going on and I'm not allowed to have sex. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  What is it?  Pregnant, too?  What's going on?  Not since I was three months pregnant.  What's going on?  What's the stuff that is going on that you can't have sex?  I'm not allowed.  I have a high-risk pregnancy.  What does that mean?  So why are you driving around in the car?  Oh, well, I can go out and stuff.  I just can't have sex.  You've got all sorts of problems going on there, Mary Beth.  What do you mean?  No socks, no flowers, no nothing.  Are you hobbing the man's knob there to keep him happy? 
[00:32:30]  That's all I do.  Oh, there you go.  Good girl.  All right.  Then the guy should get you his.  Good girl.  Get you the flowers.  No.  Hey, I'm more willing than he is.  All right.  Thank you, Mary Beth.  Thank you.  Bye.  There's a lot of miserable people out there for Valentine's Day.  I love them.  Yeah.  Listen to this guy.  JC, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  You guys suck.  Yeah.  Listen, I've got to ask your opinion.  I think I might have messed up.  Yeah.  Okay.  I got engaged with my girl on her birthday two weeks ago.  Got a nice, you know, $2,700, $2,800 ring.  And today she asked me, hey, baby, so what are we doing for Valentine's Day? 
[00:33:00]  And I said to her with a straight face, is it Smackdown on or something?  Oh, boy.  Is that wrong?  Yeah.  All the restaurants are going to be a nightmare tonight.  All right, JC.  Got it, boys.  Bye.  Steve has something.  And then we'll move on to this cute little article that was written about us.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, brother?  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know, talk about what Norton was talking about with the, you  know, guy punching the girl's teeth. 
[00:33:30]  This goes along with that.  At my high school today, they changed Valentine's Day.  It's now called V-Day, which means basically Violence Against Women Day or Vagina Day.  What?  And, yeah, basically they changed it to instead of, you know, the holiday about men and women  and, you know, the love, it's now men and women and men beating women and how we should  end the violence.  And there's signs posted up all over the school talking about all the statistics about rape 
[00:34:00]  and sexual abuse and basically saying how bad men are and how women are the victims.  All right, why don't they leave our holidays alone and maybe they can pick another day where  they can exploit that crap.  That is just, there should be a group of kids with high-powered weapons in that school.  Every high school.  They're pushing them to do that.  How in God's name does a place, a school gets so politically correct that they turn  Valentine's Day, an already silly holiday, into anti-violence against women day? 
[00:34:30]  I know, and the thing is, I mean, it's a national organization.  V-Day is like a thing that goes on all over the country and vagina monologues are, you know,  running it and I don't know.  All right.  Dude, you know, you should just put the two holidays together.  You rape a girl and then shove chocolate in her mouth so she can't scream.  Oh, God.  Oh, my Jesus.  God, you are.  Jesus.  Extra bitter today, Mr. Green.  Extra.  Love is in the air, my friend.  Love is in the air.  All right.  Thanks, Donut.  All right.  Bye. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Let's go to Katie.  Norton's coming to Buffalo?  Katie, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Yo, Katie, you from Buffalo?  Yes, I am.  Totally.  Wait, Norton's coming to Buffalo?  Yes, ma'am.  Yeah, Norton's going on tour and I think all his concert dates are going to be up on eatabullet.com.  All tickets go on sale Friday.  He's going to be in Buffalo, Cleveland, Philly, Washington, Boston, New York.  Oh, man.  Dude, Friday. 
[00:35:30]  Awesome.  Oh, my God.  I love you, Norton.  Oh, thank you, man.  Even though you're incredibly disgusting.  There you go.  It's okay.  You're basically like every guy I've ever dated.  There you have it.  So, what do you have for the show today, Katie?  Well, I'm just calling to shout out to all of us actually hot girls who don't have Valentine's today.  Just to let them know that it's okay.  Hey, what happened?  Oh, nothing.  I just don't have a Valentine right now.  Why not?  Um, I don't know, because boys are jerks. 
[00:36:00]  How old are you there, Katie?  Nineteen.  And you're really hot and you don't have a boyfriend?  Yeah.  It's pretty sad.  I'm pre-med, too.  Well, what do you look like?  Um, I don't know.  I'm like 5'4".  I'm skinny.  Ooh.  I have, like, deep breasts, but I weigh, like, under 120.  And you're a pre-med student?  Yeah.  Wow, you sound very nice.  Actually, I went to school in New York last year, and I actually scheduled all my classes 
[00:36:30]  so I could listen to you guys every day.  Oh, that's cool.  Look at that.  You might have, uh, too many of those, uh, brains there for a guy.  Oh, see, that's the problem, I think.  Got the hot body, but the brains.  The brains might be getting in the way.  What seems to be the problem?  Start acting, uh, dumber.  What gets it to the point where, um, the guys, uh, ditch you, or you ditch the guys, or  what happens?  I don't know.  You know, I really don't know what it is. 
[00:37:00]  I think they just get so scared, because I've been told basically by every guy that I'm  the coolest girl, and I think guys kind of get scared of how cool I am.  Uh-oh.  I understand.  Well, you know something, that right there, that statement is not cool at all.  Yeah.  Are you doing stuff, are you doing stuff that guys like to do?  Guys get scared by how cool I am?  Yeah, that's a weird statement, man.  Yeah, that's, that's, that's...  Cool Cunningham and Potsy?  Hey, I really, you know what, though?  I really am, I'm a great girlfriend. 
[00:37:30]  I know everything to do.  Yeah, your boyfriend said, oh, that's right, you don't have one.  Yeah, right now.  Well, look, it's...  It's okay.  It's, it's, maybe they're afraid, because you're so smart.  I mean, pre-med, you're obviously a very, very bright woman.  Yeah.  Yeah, I try to do well.  Good.  All right, I don't know what to tell you there, Katie.  You're on your own.  I want to come visit you guys when I come to New York, really badly.  Anytime, we're here.  Definitely.  I think you guys are absolutely the best, and I really want to meet Norton so badly.  Well, come to New York.  How about you, uh...  Look at that, Norton.  How about next week?  How about next week? 
[00:38:00]  Another one, Norton.  Take a little road trip there.  Yeah, right, I have school.  All right.  Well, next time...  I'm coming during break.  All right, next time you're in New York, stop by.  I definitely will.  We'll take a gander at you.  And I'm going to come see Norton, definitely.  All right, cool.  Oh, cool.  Norton, you rock.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  All right, Katie.  Bye.  I wouldn't mind, actually, a pre-med student, you inflict a little injury.  You're like, ah, she can take care of us.  Wrap that up.  Eric in a sling.  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you what your competition is doing for Valentine's Day.  We have no competition. 
[00:38:30]  Well, your alleged competition, CBS FM.  Oh, God.  CBS FM!  Hello, along!  Here in New York, there is a station, CBS FM, and...  CBS FM!  They are the oldies station, so every city's got one, with the big echoey, boomy voice of  a guy that, you know, was one of the boss jocks back in the 70s, and they sang all those  songs.  Hey, coming up next, a love song by Captain Interneal on this Valentine's Day.  CBS FM!  CBS FM! 
[00:39:00]  Hello, love!  I got one day with you.  I got 10 seconds to talk every 20 minutes.  CBS FM!  What are they doing over there?  Well, they've been promoting this idea of taking a boat, and people who've been married  for, like, 10th, 20th anniversaries, and taking them out in the middle of the ocean, and redo  their...  Renewal their vows!  Very popular, they're willing to do a Valentine's, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The only thing that makes that good is if the boat sinks at the end of the weekend.  Or if they throw half of them off like Amistad. 
[00:39:30]  Like their Kewi-Laura ending.  Leon Clayton.  Erica, that's more hokey radio.  Wacky radio.  If you're marrying people on Valentine's Day, if you're having a love cruise somewhere,  or if you're having couples that do a lip lock contest...  Where are you?  Why are you pushing me to the railing?  Why are you pushing me?  I don't know how to swim.  Don't push me on in the water! 
[00:40:00]  Why are you pushing me into the water?  Some comic on a cruise ship?  Oh, my.  He used to do a Leon Klinghoffer joke, and they fired him for it.  I don't know who the...  It was on a ship.  And it was something along the lines of, I had to...  I wanted to have a drink, so I ordered a Leon Klinghoffer, and they said,  watch that, it's two shots and a splash.  All right, later, boys.  That's not my joke.  Whatever comic it is, it's... 
[00:40:30]  Oh, yeah, very nice.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Leon Klinghoffer, Huffer jokes, always funny.  Always fun.  Yes.  Hey, guys, I've been around a long time.  I don't impress real easy, but I've got to take my hat off to you guys.  With this 55-gallon drum challenge...  Yeah.  You actually have women calling up, trying to think of ways to impress you.  Yeah.  But you can torture them later.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's wonderful.  By the way, that is on today.  Any ladies want to try to impress us?  Yeah, we're trying to find contestants for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  It's going to go down in about two to three weeks. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  In the meantime, we will be getting girls to come down here.  And give us a little something.  A little, maybe an example of how you can handle what might happen in that drum.  Some disgusting stuff on you.  I don't know.  It's really open to anything.  As an example, we've got a girl coming down tomorrow, Rick?  Tomorrow.  She can't make it today.  She's going to do a headstand.  Norton will hold her feet up in the air.  And in that position, she will apply some yellow discipline. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, that's good.  It's going to go on her, so it's kind of like stuff that might be in the barrel.  It's fun to watch.  Yeah.  Like a geyser.  When Norton's holding her feet up, the guy's going to do it with one hand.  He's going to be pointing and saying, look what I'm packing with the other.  He's going to look like a kid at the drinking fountain.  I was just thinking of that.  A little wife's only sign.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Push the little button.  All right.  Uncle John.  Slurp it up.  Get a good one. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  The ladies want to call us today with what they would do to get into the 55-gallon drum.  Jump Challenge.  That would be nice.  Okay?  Right.  All righty, Ant.  We love it.  Yeah.  And I hear we're going to get probably a pretty good prize for it.  A really good prize.  Yeah.  Don't you worry, girls.  One good thing about syndication, the prizes have gotten better.  Yeah.  It's true.  Well, and we're looking for the ladies in Phoenix to help us out with the contest.  Phoenix.  What is that about?  Why don't we get into this?  Well, you have to take a break, though. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, damn it.  Phoenix.  Phoenix.  I guess the industry is, the radio industry, and is panicking over you and I being syndicated.  So now they're writing little articles in the trade magazines how they can compete against us.  They're trying to help each other out.  They're trying to help each other out.  Come up with a game plan to counter-program this program.  So they're getting program directors from all over the country and with their suggestions how to compete against the Opie and Anthony show if it hits your market.  What do we do?  They got big-time consultants, pussy PDs that want to be anonymous for the article. 
[00:43:00]  Here's an actual quote from a PD when we first came into his market.  Some of the things in this little article are completely ridiculous.  One program director, Cruz.  Oh, my God.  Thinking that he's someone in the business, I guess.  He runs a radio station in Boston that you can't even hear in most places. 
[00:43:30]  He was so bad on the air that he had to finally, you know, get his ass off the air.  That's good.  Get a program director that sucks so bad on the air to tell your personalities what to do to compete against Opie and Anthony.  Idiot.  Oh, this is the worst thing I've ever read.  Isn't it hilarious?  Isn't it bad?  It is the worst thing I've ever read.  We have a program director who is hearing we're coming into their town.  Don't you do it! 
[00:44:00]  Don't you!  Wow.  I have no place else to go.  A lot of people get fired when we come to town.  What can I tell you?  Ah.  All right, we'll get into the article next.  Go through that game plan.  Yeah, this is the playbook, Ant.  Yeah, the playbook.  Here it is.  Here's the playbook.  And we'll hopefully get more ladies calling up for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  You want to compete against us?  I'll give a great tip. 
[00:44:30]  Stop doing hokey radio.  There you go.  Hey!  Stop marrying people on the air for Valentine's Day.  But Dave, what else can I do?  Hey, Valentine's Day.  I was with my chick last night.  Let me tell you, we were getting into it.  Just don't disgust your listeners anymore with that talk.  Ugh.  Big bloated mess just pounding away on something.  Ugh.  What, you don't think it's hot when a big, fat, sweaty jock talks about his sexual escapades?  Let me tell you. 
[00:45:00]  So there it was.  Pounding it.  Don't even.  Ugh.  That is disgusting.  I'm hung like a mushroom.  And with my beer belly, it barely pops out.  But the girls love it.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Let me just sweat on you for a while.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  You don't let me...  How was that, Dave?  Yeah.  Let me think of something that makes me all excited. 
[00:45:30]  This should save my job for another six months.  Dave.  Hey, you're a randy one.  All right.  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  Let me adjust my tie and type this out.  Are you ribbing us?  Oh, golly.  Good gravy.  Keepers, creepers.  Look at me, Pete.  How racist.  Oh, my God.  Oh, brother.  Dude.  F*** yourself. 
[00:46:00]  Tasteless, offensive.  I need drugs.  Sucks on a daily basis.  White pussy boy suburban humor.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Aren't we supposed to be trained to gain listeners' guides?  No!  The Opie and Anthony show.  Is that a surprise to you?  M-D-E-W.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  The Naughty Nighty contest continues.  You've got to vote every single day.  Yes, competition heating up. 
[00:46:30]  The voting is getting sick.  We've got 98 contestants.  By Monday, we'll be down to 20.  Yep.  And then the real voting begins.  We'll have a nice page for you with all thumbnail pictures and stuff so you can do some nice comparing.  Yes, a little cross comparison.  But right now, we've got so many girls, we've got an hour down to the top 20.  Yeah.  I'm using my votes very wisely, Anthony.  Because I'm not completely positive of who I want to win the damn thing. 
[00:47:00]  Are you spreading them around?  Spreading them around.  Yeah.  I gave a vote to Washington.  I gave a couple votes to Philly.  Oh, you did.  I gave a vote to Boston.  And I think tomorrow I'm going to have to use my vote for Sacramento.  Are you?  I don't think Sacramento needs any of our help, to tell you the truth.  Now, one of my votes has gone to a New York girl.  Wow, that's bad.  Quite frankly, I think the New York girls let us down on this contest.  I'm agreeing with you. 
[00:47:30]  I've got to pop it up here.  There we go.  So make sure you vote.  You go to opianthony.com for that.  I almost didn't vote today.  And no, Rick, I'm not voting for her.  Don't worry.  She'll make it, right?  She looks like she might be in, in the top 20.  Vote for that. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  Well, Anthony, you want to get into this article?  Yeah, let's talk about how the programmers are counter-programming opian, Anthony.  I guess people feel threatened out there that we might be coming to their town to do our radio show.  So they need a plan.  So one of the big magazines that goes to every radio station in America did an article on UNI. 
[00:48:30]  It's not a magazine you can buy.  Maybe we can put this online or something because it's pretty silly.  And it says,  Programmers Mold the Impact of Opian Anthony.  There's a whole article on how other stations could compete against us, Anthony.  What should they do?  What should they do?  So they talk to a lot of program directors and consultants and stuff.  And the article is, quite frankly, a piece of crap.  It's awful.  Real fast, though.  Jersey Bob from Jersey writes, 
[00:49:00]  I hear the French-owned radio stations have already surrendered.  And junk mail jury from the city.  The other markets trying to plan against O&A is like the Poles sending horses against the Nazi tank Blitzkrieg.  Yeah.  That didn't work out well.  No, no.  So the article starts.  It says,  They attracted attention almost instantly in New York and Boston.  They're on in seven of the top ten markets.  And even with the talk show,  their rock and roll sensibility means they could draw an audience from any mail-targeted station. 
[00:49:30]  Yes.  So Rock Airplay Monitor asks,  Consultants and programmers how they're dealing with Infinity's syndicated afternoon host Opian Anthony.  Hmm.  How are they dealing with us?  Did you know that we had a rock and roll sensibility?  I've always felt I had a certain rock and roll sensibility.  I just never saw it in writing like that.  I must say, I'm quite sensible when it comes to my rock and roll choices.  I used to say, you know, it's kind of an unwritten thing. 
[00:50:00]  I have a rock and roll sensibility.  Now I can't say that.  It's written.  Sucks for me.  That doesn't, though, because you've already said it, but now the proof is in the pudding.  Oh, God.  The proof is indeed in the pudding.  I thought we weren't hipsters, Anthony.  Oh, apparently we are.  We have that rock and roll sensibility.  Rock and roll sensibility.  Which means we don't have to prove how hip we are by playing cool tunes.  We're rock and roll, yet we're sensible about it.  Right.  Which I like.  We have a certain rock and roll sensibility.  Yeah, we don't want to go too crazy with the sensibility factor. 
[00:50:30]  No, no, because that wouldn't be rock and roll.  We don't want to go too far into the new wave genre.  Wouldn't be sensible.  Or the 70s butt rock genre.  We want to keep it very sensible.  Right.  And everybody says rock and roll to this day.  Rock and roll.  You want to go to the rock and roll show tonight, do you?  The rock and roll show.  Who's going to be playing at the rock and roll show?  And you've got to have the N in the middle.  It can't be rock and roll.  With the two lines.  Right.  Rock and roll.  I throw on Mr. Roboto every once in a while to keep my sensibility up. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  You've got to have your sensibility up.  Doesn't Johnny Race have a rock and roll sensibility?  Rock and roll, Johnny Race, rock and roll.  There he goes.  He's sensible.  Oh, okay.  He's just rock and roll.  He's not very sensible.  All right.  So, uh.  No.  He has rock and roll alcoholism.  This article says nothing about competing against you and I, Ant.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Go back to the drawing board.  Yeah.  It says in this paragraph, some PDs thought the only way to respond was not to react. 
[00:51:30]  Ah, that's a great strategy.  So, there are a lot of radio stations up against us.  They're telling their jocks and stuff.  Don't react.  Don't.  Those guys are real obnoxious.  They'll say a lot of crazy things.  Don't react to it.  Just to make it like it's not happening.  You'll play into their hands.  Right.  You're going to play into their hands.  So, don't react.  We'll just make believe they don't exist.  Don't react.  That works so well.  If you don't react to the Opie and Anthony show in your market, you're a pussy. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Come on.  And you should be replaced by satellite radio.  It's not sensible.  Douchebags.  Don't react.  Make believe they don't exist.  Hey, that's what I'm doing.  Exactly.  It's working very well.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Huh?  The thing here, it says, don't say ONA.  And the programmers also, the on-air personality, shouldn't be mentioned.  And it says here, DeMeyer says, they are just sticking to their knitting. 
[00:52:30]  Focusing on their music benefits.  We're going to stick to our knitting.  Sticking to their knitting.  What the hell does that even mean?  There couldn't be one funny thing on that.  Whatever station this zilch is on, there couldn't be one funny thing said there.  All day.  There's some great stuff in here.  So it says, some PDs thought the only way to respond was not to react.  Yeah.  Among them is DC 101, bunch of pussies.  Oh, boy.  All the jocks on DC 101 in Washington were told not to talk about Opie and Anthony. 
[00:53:00]  Don't talk about them.  Just don't react to it.  How does it feel to be told what to say on your radio show?  Don't react.  Yeah.  Among them is DC 101, Washington, D.C.  The PD, Buddy Riser.  Buddy Riser with you.  Hey, Buddy Riser.  Buddy Riser says, we've always gone under the premise that we have to make sure that everything  that we do is the best it can be.  And we keep examining from there.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:53:30]  I almost fell asleep just you reading that quote from that guy.  Imagine sitting in a meeting.  So basically that means make sure your breaks are concise.  Make sure you don't babble too much.  Make sure you seg the tunes just right.  Get in and out of spot breaks.  Don't have a personality.  Basically, they're...  That's what I say.  Basically, they're telling you at DC 101 in Washington to shut your traps.  Right.  That there's nothing you can do to compete against us.  Oh, my God.  I hope they do something stupid and get fired before they take all our ratings, too. 
[00:54:00]  Well, that's always a possibility.  But other programmers did have thoughts on counter-programming a talk show that competes  with music stations.  Here's the biggest tool ever.  We've kind of competed against Opie and Anthony on both fronts, WFNX Boston PD Cruz says.  Cruz.  Instead of doing all music or go all talk, we've tried to take the best elements of both.  Let me tell you something about WFNX in Boston.  Yeah.  We don't even know they exist.  And this tool thinks he's competing against you and I in afternoon radio. 
[00:54:30]  He's a little delusional.  That is a station that, if you're up there in Boston, you can't even hear it.  It's all static.  It doesn't show up in the ratings.  It's kind of funny that they're even mentioned.  Yeah.  He goes, we've kind of competed against Opie and Anthony on both fronts.  What?  Oh, yeah.  The ratings certainly say that.  They're not even a blip on the ratings radar screen.  It's weird that they would pick that station even talking about. 
[00:55:00]  So, Mr. Cruz, how are you competing against us?  Yeah.  They're not on the radar.  If your numbers are not even close, I don't even think you have 1% of the listeners we  have, but you're kind of competing with us.  Wasn't he cruising the afternoon?  How you guys doing?  Here's another example of a station.  There's a guy that was smart about competing against Opie and Anthony.  I'll just get him on board.  I'll just get him on my station.  I don't care.  Hey, guys.  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  I'm so happy you're here. 
[00:55:30]  Because now you're not going to kick my ass.  That's right.  That's right.  Where's that quote?  So, Mr. Cruz is delusional.  He thinks his station and his afternoon drive show competes against us, Ant.  They're competing against us.  It really is funny when you look at the ratings that come out.  They're not even on there.  They're like way at the end if they even show up.  They're on like the third page. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  The ratings come out and there's like, I don't know, close to 15 to 20 stations per page.  They're on like the third page.  That's competing against us.  Boys, I'm working on remedying that problem by getting shwoogies to listen.  B-b-b-boys.  Brucey Mittman's in charge over there, I think.  The best part is this guy tried to hire us so bad and now he's going to tell the whole industry how to compete against us.  B-b-b-boys.  Remember when you were kissing Bruce's ass going, Bruce, do you really think we have a chance getting O.P. and Anthony? 
[00:56:30]  I'm going to New York.  I'll be talking with the b-b-boys.  At the Hudson Hotel.  So, Cruzy, you just sit back and I'll close the deal.  Watch me work my magic.  B-b-b-boys.  You won't have to worry about your job anymore when we bring the boys back to town.  Let me tell you, it's going to be so much fun.  You being suspended and me being suspended.  It'll be like the old days.  Right. 
[00:57:00]  All right, so then it goes on to say, playing music is important, but when you're going up against a show like O.P. and Anthony,  if music is your only calling card, then I think you're really relegating yourself to a secondary position.  Right.  Mr. Cruz says,  it might be different if those guys weren't known in the market.  If they were a new show with no real momentum behind them,  then you might just want to keep the friendly afternoon guy playing the music and talking about the artists.  How are you?  And the radio station like a typical afternoon show. 
[00:57:30]  A friendly little guy.  L-I-L.  I'm the friendly little guy here.  I'm back to more music.  I'm the friendly little guy.  How are you?  I'll tell you what song you just heard, tell you what's coming up, maybe give you the weather.  Sticking to the knitting.  I'm sticking to the knitting.  I'm going to give a laundry list of all the songs I just played,  and it's all a bunch of songs that my listeners have heard a million times,  so I don't even know why I'm telling them the titles of the songs they just heard.  I don't think I ever heard ONA do one school closing when it snows. 
[00:58:00]  That's why we're here.  We're the local guys.  We're the fun guys.  How are you?  You know what school closings are good for?  It's helpful for pedophiles to know where not to show up.  Oh, God.  Molesters to know where not to hit the bus stops.  Yeah.  Don't waste your time there.  Damn it, snow day.  Go to the park with a toboggan.  And then Jeff Pollock pops in, or pipes in, I should say. 
[00:58:30]  Jeff Pollock.  I love his impressions of Captain Kirk.  He does a great impression of Captain Kirk.  And what's the other one Pollock does?  Peter Falk?  It's Kevin.  Oh, Kevin Pollock?  Yeah, I think there's my...  Oh, okay.  I thought it was going to be some entertainment now.  I think it's his brother or something.  He's good in casino, too.  Yeah, that was very good.  Jeff Pollock.  Jeff Pollock agrees that a high-profile afternoon talent is one of the best ways to compete,  if it's the right talent. 
[00:59:00]  The only way to counter-program a successful personality show like Opie and Anthony is to  have a compelling local show.  Really?  Or opt to do the kind of music programming that winds up being a major benefit for your radio  station 24 hours a day.  What does that even mean?  It means nothing, because the music stations blow.  They just play the same stuff over and over again, so how are they going to make it compelling?  Isn't that what they tried to do with Will here in New York over at K-Rock?  Yeah.  Ouch.  Yeah.  Isn't that what they're trying to do with... 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That worked real well.  Kane and Cabby over there now.  Yeah, Kane and Cabby are doing the same thing.  It's working real well.  Ouch.  Yeah.  They're the friendly local host, Anthony.  How are ya?  In other words, if you have better than average talent, it makes no sense for that jock to  talk more in a bid to outdo Opie and Anthony.  Wait, so the more talented you are, the less you should talk?  Is that what he's saying?  In other words, if you have better than average talent, it makes no sense for that jock to  talk more in a bid to outdo Opie and Anthony.  So if you're talented, the more talented you are, the less you should talk. 
[01:00:00]  So basically, they're saying if you're on a music station, shut your trap and just keep  playing the tunes because you don't have a chance against Opie and Anthony.  No matter how good your PD tells you you are, he really just wants you to shut up.  His ultimate goal would be if you didn't say a goddamn word and you just said the songs.  Believe me, the only reason you're allowed to talk at all is because they have to give  a little to keep you happy a little bit.  That's the only reason.  When you're at a music station, they don't want you talking.  No, they allow you to talk because it's kind of a trade-off because they need someone 
[01:00:30]  to push the buttons.  Right, exactly.  Because they haven't figured out how to make a monkey do it yet.  They will.  They're working on it.  There is actually.  They have to pay someone to push the buttons like, okay, at 4.20, time to play commercials.  Someone has to do that.  So they throw you a bone like, hey, look, man, look, you're playing all the tunes and the  commercials.  Look, we'll give you 20 seconds every 20 minutes to do a weather break or just give a laundry  list of all the songs they just heard.  And then that person thinks they're a big-time rock and roll jock.  Read the upcoming events verbatim. 
[01:01:00]  Don't stray from it.  You're missing something here.  There is somebody that I think has figured out how to compete against you two very effectively,  and I would suggest dealing with it or being overrun.  All right.  Fast.  It's the, I don't even want to mention the names, but I will.  The old Storm and Birdsey.  Oh, yeah.  Had a comment here.  They would say, if you guys think their show is lame, me and their own show, whoever you're  listening to, or if they listen to somebody else, they encourage you to go listen to somebody 
[01:01:30]  else because they're just that damn good.  Wow.  They would say.  That's putting it all on the line, telling your listeners to go check out the competition.  And if the competition is better, then there you have it.  But we're so confident in what we do, we know you're coming back.  Yeah.  This is what they do.  No, but here is where it gets really interesting.  Yeah.  They would say, if you guys think their show is lame, whoever you're listening to, you  should send them a lump of coal for their Christmas stocking. 
[01:02:00]  Wait, so the Storm and Birdsey guys.  Yeah.  They're like, okay, look, if you think there's something better than us out there, why don't  you go check out the other shows.  But then as you're checking out those other shows, you're going to realize some of these  shows are lame.  And then you have to get some coal and send it in their Christmas stocking to kind of  show them how lame they are.  Send them a lump of coal.  A lump of coal.  And you're stuck in.  Read the next line because I have some inside info on something that went down in Boston. 
[01:02:30]  Go ahead.  You bet, GH.  All right.  One overzealous listener actually dumped a truckload of coal in WBCN's parking lot several  days.  A truckload, Ant.  Before Christmas.  Generating considerable publicity.  Basically saying that BCN is so lame.  That someone dumped a bunch of coal.  Here's a truckload of coal.  Do you know that that stupid station, Bob, paid a guy to dump a truckload of coal outside  the station and they were all proud of themselves? 
[01:03:00]  It just...  And he didn't even call for a truckload.  He only called for a lump of a stocking.  A lump in your stocking.  That would be funny if he called for a lump of coal in.  That might be interesting.  We don't have to pay people to do bits for our show.  How pathetic is that?  There you go.  We've got this great idea.  Well, we're going to have to pay someone to dump a truckload outside the station.  Man, that'll really rile them up inside.  I remember one year I was bad and I got a lump of coal in my stocking. 
[01:03:30]  How awful is that?  I'm almost embarrassed for them.  All right.  Here, more of Jeff Pollack.  You know, the guy talking about the local guy there just playing the tunes and being  really entertaining.  All right.  That is a disastrous idea, you know, having someone try to out-talk Opie and Anthony  Anthony.  So he says, either you put on a personality that transcends the music and can attract  Hume from a variety of formats, or you wisely use the time to sell the key images and the 
[01:04:00]  music positioning of your station.  Huh?  Well, I was dozing off just listening to it.  That basically means if you're like the 80s station in town, you tell everyone over and  over again you're the 80s station.  That you're the 80s station.  Let them know that you're the 80s station.  Because that's more important than trying to out-talk you and I.  All right.  Brian Riblett from D.C. has a great idea.  This should have been on here.  Best way to compete against the O&A show.  Move your show to D.C.  where you will kick our ass because we are tanking in D.C.  That's a great idea, Brian. 
[01:04:30]  There you have it.  Joe, what's going on?  What's going on, O&A?  How's that doing tonight?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I was going to recall that you guys know I picked you guys up out of Philly on YST.  Yeah.  And there's a competing rock station.  I don't know if I can say it, but I'm going to say it anyway.  What the hell?  Sure.  And then Mark.  Yeah.  They say, why listen to O&A?  They're not from Philadelphia.  Who gives an ass?  You guys are funny.  You make people enjoy driving home and sitting in traffic for three hours. 
[01:05:00]  You make people say, you have the five o'clock queen.  You know, six o'clock queen.  Isn't that funny?  You know what I mean?  But wait, that's the best thing to come up with is just tell everyone that, hey, they're  not from Philly.  Why listen to that?  Why?  Because we're entertaining and funny.  And to tell you the truth, we're probably in Philly more than their stupid jocks over  there.  Don't watch Leno.  He's in L.A.  Exactly.  Don't vote for Bush.  He's from Texas.  You jackasses.  Joe, Morton, when are you coming back to Philly, man?  March 28th.  Yeah, we're going back soon.  All right.  We can't wait.  I'm from South Jersey. 
[01:05:30]  Everyone down here loves you guys.  Keep up the good work.  You guys suck.  All right.  That is so pathetic.  Bye, fella.  Hey, don't listen to Opie and Anthony.  They're not local hometown boys.  Local yokel.  I think it makes it a little more fun when I start talking about the Islanders and the  Flyer fans call up and get pissed.  That's a lot of texture to a radio show.  Oh, did I say texture?  No.  Texture.  It was awful, but I wasn't.  All right.  Matt, what's up?  Matt.  Yeah.  What's up, Matt?  The DC 101, the station you were just talking about. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  The manager, the station manager or whoever he was, used to be a jock, but he was so horrible  that they did take him off.  And the DJs used to reference him, but they were just talking about what you guys are doing  this morning.  They were just talking about how they're getting their ass kicked, but they weren't saying  it in such a clear way.  You know, the morning guy down at DC 101 used to...  Elliot.  Yeah, he's funny.  Elliot.  Elliot.  I'll give him a plug.  I don't care.  Elliot used to kiss our asses like you wouldn't believe up here in New York, so... 
[01:06:30]  He's annoying as all crap, too.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  When your name is Elliot, how can you not be funny?  A lot of guys named Elliot are really amusing, we all know.  I just love these...  I just love these fake radio personalities.  Like, Elliot used to kiss our asses.  He's actually a nice guy, but would kiss our asses all the time when he saw us in New York.  Birdsey, when he got fired from WAF, begging, begging and sending packages wanting to be  part of the O.P. and Anthony show.  And we actually weren't even taking his calls because we were so convinced it was a fake 
[01:07:00]  schlocko bit that, like, hey, I got fired and now I'm going to try to get a job at another  station.  And then, hey, you got a job at another station.  Birdsey, what's that?  I think it's funny.  Begging to get a job with us and now he'll attempt to try to trash us.  Oh, well.  I think the only way to compete with you two is to call you Opie and Dopey.  I like Dopey and Ain't Funny myself.  That's a good one.  That one's a scream.  Stick to your knitting.  Don't listen to them.  They're not from town. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, boy.  Lump of coal in your stocking.  Knitting.  How about if you don't like...  Knitting.  I almost said something really that would have gotten...  That's all right.  Knitting.  Gotta love the word knitting.  Knitting.  Sticking to your knitting, are you?  Maybe you could send a knitting needle and a lump of coal in stock.  Phil, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good job.  Hey, the sweet 97 Rock we have here in Buffalo, they're not reacting either. 
[01:08:00]  They just keep on the oldest and, oh, my God, the worst fossils known to man.  Well, a lot of these stations just praying we could just go away.  I mean, we have a reputation for effing up good situations, so they're like, ah, don't  worry, dudes.  Eventually, they'll get fired, and then we could go back to just owning this town by being  really boring and playing the worst 70s butt rock known to man, butt rock.  Well, you've got the Carl Rock and Roll Russo here.  His big bit is, he blows in the fuzz.  Call him on your cell phone and tell him where the cops are. 
[01:08:30]  That's just so wild.  Where did he come up with that?  So he's doing like CB radio bits.  Wow.  That's a smoky report.  He's doing smoky reports.  Hey.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  You know what?  That's an attention getter.  Sir, what is the name of that, if I could ask, the name of the bit?  It's called Blow in the Fuzz.  Report the heinousness on the highways.  Blow in the Fuzz. 
[01:09:00]  Hey, you know what?  I've got to give it to the man.  He's still beating us in the Buffalo rating, so I guess the Blow in the Fuzz bit is working  quite well for him.  Blow in the Fuzz.  It's like having pieces of wood pounded under your fingernails listening to this.  Yeah, but hey guys, where's the fuzz?  I don't know.  Turn on that guy.  He does a fuzz report.  How funny can you be if you call the cops the fuzz?  Nobody calls them fuzz.  I was just thinking that.  It's like, when was the last time the cops was off the bus? 
[01:09:30]  Exactly.  We got us a smoky report here.  God damn.  We got to get our course.  There's been a little fender bender.  Let's put it this way.  In the morning, they still let the lobster roll.  There's been a fender bender up on I-53.  You better go around it, pendant.  Breaker, breaker.  We got a bear in the air. 
[01:10:00]  We're going to be blowing in the fuzz.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, who's that pretty little seat cover I'm seeing?  Looking down from my big rig.  All right, later guys.  You blow.  All right, you know, maybe we need to do more CB radio bits.  CB bits.  Hey, is this the fuzz?  Hey, look, I saw one right by Tanawanda.  Good reference.  The fuzz.  Oh, that fuzz report really helping everyone out. 
[01:10:30]  Thanks for the fuzz report.  That was groovy.  The fuzz.  The Beastie Boys are funnier when they're singing for Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Can we stop playing that on this program?  The left one jizz bags.  Jesse, what's going on?  What's up, man?  I'm from Philly, right?  The guy that called in about MMR?  Yeah.  Dude, he is so right.  MMR bashes you guys every day.  Well.  They're saying, like, don't listen to them.  We got better music.  I listen to you guys.  I'm up in New York every weekend. 
[01:11:00]  My girlfriend lives up there.  I love you guys.  I've been listening to you since the summer.  Yeah.  You guys are great.  Well, thank you.  We appreciate that.  Dude, keep doing what you're doing, man.  All right, man.  See you.  All right.  Until you said that, you know, I've never thought of MMR ever.  It's never even occurred to me that there was a station called MMR.  Who cares?  We don't even care about the...  Why don't they just stick to their knitting?  Stick to your knitting.  We like goofing on a lot of radio stations, but if your show is playing music up against  us, we don't consider you a competition.  Sorry.  Sorry. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, I have an idea.  Why don't you get all the listeners to send them a lump of coal for their stockings?  You think a lot of these jocks that play music all afternoon long, they get the ratings  and go, wow, look how good I'm doing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They do.  Look, I've played the Godsmack song a hundred times this week, and look, it's having an effect  on my ratings.  Like, we got a station here, Light FM in New York.  You got one in your town.  They play all that light music that you hear wherever the hell you go.  They play it in the department stores, in the delis, in the workplace. 
[01:12:00]  So that's safe music.  You'll hear safe music.  And there's a woman, Valerie Smalltone.  She does the show over there.  What is she?  Is she in the afternoons?  I think she's up against us.  Or she, right?  I guess so.  Okay.  Her whole big thing that she does in the TV commercial with Terry Garr is that she doesn't  talk.  It's all music, less talk.  So they show her looking at Terry Garr, smiling and pushing the button. 
[01:12:30]  That's her job.  But you know damn well when those ratings come out, she's there and go, Valerie, you're  doing a great job.  It's like anyone.  Earl could be behind that board and push those buttons.  And it would do the same thing.  Or he could wind up in someone's Christmas stocking if they don't like the station.  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry, Earl.  Holy ass.  This can't be true.  What's that?  I know they're J. Owen in Boston because their show is getting a lot of mentions. 
[01:13:00]  Trust me.  Not even the competition.  Chris from Boston writes, hey guys, what a great talent Bursey must be.  He went from Schlocko's trusty sidekick to effing Storms.  Every time he does a station ID and says his name Storm, he plays a tape of a thunderstorm.  No, he doesn't.  No, he doesn't. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, how you doing?  It's Storm and Birdsy.  It's a bird.  You got to accent it better.  It's Storm and Birdsy.  Hey, give me another one.  Oh, you need another one?  It's Storm and Birdsy. 
[01:14:00]  Birdsy.  Doug from Springfield.  What's up?  Maybe I'm a little effed up in the head, but I can't understand this.  Why would a radio station that plays music want to take people away that like listening to talk radio?  No.  I don't understand that.  They think playing the same 20 songs over and over again is the way to compete against us.  But it's like if you like talk radio, you'll listen to talk radio. 
[01:14:30]  If you like music, won't you listen to music stations?  Right.  I'll tell you what's going on.  The rock programmers in America.  We got one right here in New York.  Steve Kingston.  He's a blowhard.  He stinks.  He's the worst program director in America, but keeps his job.  How hard is it to get a communication degree?  They have completely ruined radio to the point where people are flooding to this type of radio.  Because we give you a program where you really don't know what you're going to hear.  You know, we may suck one day.  We may, you know, really blow it out another. 
[01:15:00]  You know, but I mean, when you listen to these rock radio stations, you know what you're getting.  The same freaking 20 songs over and over again.  I would say the same 10 songs.  Yeah.  How long does it take to get a communication degree?  Because I want to get into radio now.  A lot of program directors completely wreck this business by listening to other program directors,  listening to consultants.  That's why every station sounds the same no matter what city you're in.  They all blow.  Ah, pussle.  They make believe they play requests. 
[01:15:30]  They don't play requests.  It doesn't make sense to play requests.  They play the songs that test the best in their auditorium tests.  Right.  Who is this nerd with glasses?  That's Steve Kingston.  We call him the Abercrombie and Fitch Midget.  Doesn't he look like the Wall Street Journal reporter that got kidnapped?  And it does look just like him.  Just picture him only a lot shorter.  Yeah, I think we've pretty much gone as far as we can go with this article. 
[01:16:00]  No, there's a few more things.  Oh, stop.  Then there's this...  I pretty much thought that was about all you could do to counter-program.  Then there's an anonymous PD.  He's so scared of us he doesn't even want his name in the article, Anthony.  He's the anonymous PD.  Who's this guy?  Dave Dickless.  The unknown PD.  He wears a paper bag over his head.  Our anonymous PD takes the musical taste of the typical Opie and Anthony fan into consideration.  We're careful not to play the music that's most appealing to Opie and Anthony fans. 
[01:16:30]  Because the music fans would rather listen to Opie and Anthony than the music.  If you figure the typical O&A listener likes Godsmack and Rage Against the Machine, which they do.  A lot of them, anyway.  Sabbath.  For example.  Then I'm not going to put a heavy dose of that music up against them.  It's so calculated.  Oh, Anthony, I've got to interrupt this little article because Josh is calling in.  As we blow in the fuzz...  Yes, Josh? 
[01:17:00]  Yo, guys, I'm just calling to let our listeners know that there's a cop in between 46 and 47 on the L.A.E. underneath an overpass, so watch out.  Are we officially stealing the bitch?  We might as well.  Everyone else is stealing our F.U. line and the MILF contest and everything else.  All right.  Thank you, Josh, for blowing in a fuzz today.  I've got to bitch you guys out, though.  Listen, I haven't gotten wowed in, like, a year.  On Long Island, these girls aren't doing it anymore, man. 
[01:17:30]  It'll happen.  No, you guys got to push it, man.  We push it in the spring, my friend.  All right.  All right?  Thanks, bro.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  Yeah, but he should call in and tell us more about that one.  Hey, how about this?  For the blowing out the fuzz thing, you could say, like, where the cops are going to be,  so if you're some, like, illegal immigrant, you can stand in a vestibule and they can pump 41 shots into you and save us all a lot of trouble.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:18:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  One more thing about this article is we discuss how people are attempting to compete against us in other cities.  Right.  Another area in which Opie and Anthony leave themselves open is by not being local. 
[01:18:30]  They'll sometimes be national in a good way, like if they've got a great guest or something.  That might be of more interest than what a local station would have on, Cruz says.  Mr. Cruz again.  Yeah.  But I really like the days when they're spending a lot of time talking about Phoenix.  Phoenix?  We're not on in Phoenix, Mr. Cruz.  It's your problem.  Way to pay attention to what we're doing so they can compete against us. 
[01:19:00]  This article goes on and on and on and on and on.  Dan from Jersey saying, the fuzz out here in Jersey thicker than bugs on a bumper, 10-4.  A little smoky report.  Corey, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Just wanted to say another way to compete with you is to put you on late at night like they did in Chicago.  That's how Chicago is competing against us.  They just put us on late at night. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, by the way, 102 over 7.  That works so much.  Well, go ahead.  102 over 7 in the middle on the Jersey turplike.  Smoke the bear.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Watch the truck side.  All right.  Later.  Blow the fuzz.  That's funny for me.  It's just so awful and hokey.  Is this true?  We just found out who the anonymous PD is.  Jeremy Coleman right here.  Our own PD is bashing us.  Mystery PD.  Mystery PD. 
[01:20:00]  What a pussy that you have to be an anonymous PD in an article that's going on every radio station in America.  Douchebag.  He doesn't want us yelling at him.  Well, there you go.  There's your playbook.  There you have it, Ant.  They're coming after us.  They're coming after us.  Good luck to you.  Good luck.  Look how well that's working for Rocco.  Him listening to Dave Dickless.  Telling him not to talk about us.  Don't mention him.  No matter what happens.  I love that one clip when we got Psycho Tim there with the bullhorn. 
[01:20:30]  They just had to shut up.  They had to shut her down.  They had to shut their show down instead of reacting and having some fun with it.  We gave them a chance to compete with us right on the air right then.  And what did they do?  They decided to shut her down and play a Led Zeppelin song.  Shut it up.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  AAF also brags that they play more music than WBCN.  There you go.  So that's basically telling the jocks that they're not important and shut the F up and just play the music. 
[01:21:00]  People own CDs now, right?  Break a break.  We got a smoker report.  Oh, yes.  Actually, it's called the blowing up.  Blowing the fuzz.  That's right.  Hey, Wrangler, diamond dust your head.  And westbound the LAE exit, Florida.  You got a smoky bear behind the bridge shooting in the gas hole.  All right.  Thank you, Bobby.  Keep the shiny side up and the dirty side down, and we're rolling.  We'll see you.  Bobby Bigrigger, we're out.  There he goes.  Bobby Bigrigger. 
[01:21:30]  Unfortunately, he's so serious when he does that.  He knows all the lingo.  He does.  That's sad.  Yeehaw.  All right, Ant.  We're going to talk about the 55-gallon jump challenge when we get back, okay?  Yes, we need this.  And we got, like, this guy.  He's a bad breath doctor.  What is this, Rick?  What is this?  It's a doctor, and he diagnoses you, or he tells you what you're eating and what you should be eating.  Based on what? 
[01:22:00]  I guess he's got a little machine that you breathe into.  I guess he'll also tell you the bad stuff that's in your mouth, all that stuff.  So you blow into a machine, and your breath will, all right.  Great.  Well, you can't get Bruce Willis to the day.  This is the illogical guy.  This is how you compete against the O&A show.  Don't worry.  We'll self-destruct.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, it barely fits through the hole.  And just squeeze it through.  Squish it through.  Squish it through. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, my God.  It's another fish.  That was a whopper.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The O.P. and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  Rob Zombie.  Never going to stop.  See, we play a little music.  That's all you need.  The hooks.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sandra from New Bedford, Mass.  Checking in here.  Saying, I used to listen to Storm and Bursey.  And, yes, they do tell listeners to go to other radio stations. 
[01:23:00]  So I did.  That is why I haven't changed the station after I heard you.  I can't thank them for sending me to you guys.  Oh, I can thank them.  Well, there you go.  A little thank you for them.  I hope it didn't sound like we were tooting our horns too much.  But we take this very seriously.  I just think it's a lot of fun.  I want to look through some of those later, man. 
[01:23:30]  Those happy valentines that they take out in the paper.  Oh, there's some good ones?  Yeah, it's so special when you're just laid in there in like 20 of them.  On one page.  20, 100.  Well, why don't you read a few there, Anthony?  Did someone blast a friggin' fart in here?  Norton, you son of a bitch.  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  Norton.  Do I ever not admit it?  Yes, sometimes at the beginning and then you start laughing.  Rick? 
[01:24:00]  There's nothing out here.  It was pretty bad.  It was like potato chips.  No, it's all right.  Another listener wrote in and he goes, how are these stations trying to compete against  a show that doesn't have a format?  Right.  Kind of hard.  See, we keep them guessing all the time.  We might go back to playing a few tunes every hour just to screw you up a bit.  You want to read a few of those or no?  I like the one that Rick just showed me, as a matter of fact. 
[01:24:30]  I guess every paper in America.  See, this is one of those national bits that also makes sense locally, Anthony.  Ah, there you go.  In our own New York Post here in New York.  Fill in local paper here.  Yeah, fill in local paper.  You could take a...  Especially for all you listening in Phoenix today.  You're a happy valentine.  It's pretty much...  It's pretty much your basic stuff, you know.  Let me just read one.  A damsel in distress. 
[01:25:00]  A knight in shining armor.  Like a fairy tale.  Happily ever after.  E.M.  Ah.  Ooh.  Isn't that sweet?  And then you get ones like Billy O.  You know what I like about you.  Your Florida connection.  What does that mean?  Is that like cocaine?  This one's my favorite.  Dear Chit, I'm very sorry for what I did to you.  I promise that it won't happen again.  If you give me a second chance, I will take care of you forever. 
[01:25:30]  I will keep my promise.  I just want to let you know that my love is real.  Happy Valentine's Day with true love.  Keeping it real.  If you have to write, I'm sorry for what happened and what I did to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, call it off.  Thank God.  You know, please, Chit, cancel that restraining order.  Happy Valentine's Day, bitch. 
[01:26:00]  Boy.  Now, let's go to Rocket.  Rocket, what's going on?  Yo, what's happening, guys?  What's up, Rocket?  I live up in Boston.  Yeah.  And, you know, I hear you guys rip Rocco a new A all the time.  And you know something?  He just won't swing back.  Sometimes I'll flip over just to hear what he's got to say.  He just won't swing back.  Aren't you hoping going, come on, Rocco.  I know you haven't in you.  Come on, take a slide.  It's sad, guys.  I know Dave tells you to shut your trap and just play the music, but come on, Rocco. 
[01:26:30]  Yep.  You know what it's like?  You told all of us how tough you were.  Come on.  It's like when you see that kid in the schoolyard pinned down by the bully.  Yeah.  And he's just getting punched in the face over and over again.  Yeah.  And you want to go and help him, but he just won't swing back, you know?  He has nothing.  And he's such a douchebag.  Instead of helping him, you just go kick him in the head.  He has nothing.  It's all Rocco deserves.  And it's all about revenge.  You guys suck, okay?  Yeah, I don't understand, man, how you just listen to somebody put your career into the  toilet, you know? 
[01:27:00]  You want to do it yourself.  That's fine.  But you listen to Dave, and he tells you to just shut up and not talk about anything.  This is a pretty nice Valentine's, if I could.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to jump in there.  Oh, what have you got there, Norton?  Kind of moved me a little bit.  All right.  You found another one in the paper?  Yeah, this is kind of a heart tugging.  You make my heart skip a beat.  Too bad I'm numb below the neck.  Christopher Reeve.  Christopher Reeve, take that one out. 
[01:27:30]  It's kind of morning zooish, but very funny.  You want to write some, you want to read some more of the, oh, sorry, I said write.  You want to read some more of those out of the paper there, Jim?  It may take me a second to flip through.  You know, I can only read one at a time.  I don't want to pull down the third wall or anything.  So you'll be reading them, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, out of the local paper, right?  And I have to make sure that I can, like the zoo crew one is a good point, so I have to  make sure that I can only read ones that would never get through on the zoo crew, like that 
[01:28:00]  one.  They, whoa, hey, hey, whoa, they would never let that go.  All right.  Tim Sabian reminded us about something that's going on in Philly, and a lot of these cities  do this as well.  Yeah.  The contest, the 20 songs or $20,000 contest.  Oh, right, right, right.  Some of the cheaper radio stations will do 10 songs or $10,000.  Right, right.  Basically, the concept is, you know, if the jock doesn't play 20 in a row or 10, so you're 
[01:28:30]  supposed to sit there and count the songs all day long, like you have nothing better to  do with your life.  Right.  And if the jock messes up and only plays 19, and you're the right caller, you're going  to win $20,000.  Right.  Don't slip up.  The boss told me today, I best not slip up or it'll come out of my pocket.  Ho, ho.  And then they're so lame, they have to tease it, like, coming up, I think I'm going to  slip up.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if I have my count right next hour. 
[01:29:00]  Wow, that is really pathetic.  Isn't that bad?  And then they get these local rubes that are convinced that the jock in the middle  of the night might just slip up.  Yeah.  No.  The jock's going to slip up during prime time.  Prime time.  And he's only going to slip up once.  The overnight guy ain't slipping up.  The overnight guy never slips up.  He don't get the glory.  It's going to be prime time.  Right.  Probably like the 5 o'clock hour someday.  Yep.  Oh, my God, he just did 19 instead of 20. 
[01:29:30]  And it's all budgeted.  It's all budgeted.  Oh, yeah.  The radio station has a certain amount of money they could give away for contests.  Uh-huh.  So they're like, oh, well, the 20 songs are $20,000.  Let's see, we can mess up three times.  Right.  So then they sit down with a big chart and go, okay, we're going to mess up the first  time on February 20th at 520.  Oh, that's good.  Okay.  They all know.  The second time, we're going to mess up. 
[01:30:00]  Let's see.  We messed up the first time at 520.  So we've got to move to another part of the day where other people are listening.  So March 1st at 320, we're going to mess up.  All right.  Let me jot it down.  I'll jot that down.  And then the third time, we're going to throw them a little curveball and mess up at night,  but not too late at night.  So we'll make it like 710 on March 15th.  Then they give the schedule to the jocks.  And then they have a big meeting before the jock goes on to do his air shift that day.  Don't forget, you're going to be wink, wink, nudge, nudge, messing up today. 
[01:30:30]  Exactly.  So make it sound like, oh, my God, you didn't mean to do that.  Let's practice.  This is such bad, man.  It just sucks.  What's that, Jimmy?  Oh, Jimmy found another Valentine's Day message in the local newspaper.  In the local paper.  Yeah, a lot of...  Would this be from the Democrat and Chronicle?  No, no, this one is...  That's a local reference, man.  This one is from Houston, actually.  I don't know how I got this paper.  Houston.  We're not on in Houston. 
[01:31:00]  So why don't you pick a marker where we're on.  I read them as I see them.  Roses are red.  You could have made all the people in Washington feel like they're listening to a local show  if you did the Washington paper.  All right.  The Washington paper.  All right.  We're really fat and you hate O&A.  All right.  At this point, here was...  All right, so this is in...  It's from Houston.  That's the paper I have.  Yeah, it's in the paper.  Houston.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  And oh, yeah, the kids are all dead. 
[01:31:30]  Love, Andrea.  Oh.  Oh.  See, now I know why you wanted Houston.  Wow.  See, I blew your joke.  Yeah, you totally did.  I didn't know why you picked Houston.  Wow.  I thought you weren't smart enough and I thought you needed my help.  But no, you knew where you were going.  You blew it because it was Houston.  Now I'm not going to correct you when you name a city.  He knows best.  Because now I know where the bit's going, my friend.  I'm sorry. 
[01:32:00]  It's okay.  And notice how I didn't say Yates.  I gave everyone credit.  All right.  We went so long about how to compete against us that we have to take another break here.  Look, sleepy bears checking in.  Brown sugar.  Bye, sweetie.  Love ooty booty.  Hey, where's the coffee with all this foam?  What is that?  Oh, it must be a cafe latte, but it's all foam.  Yeah.  Lee?  I made a mistake.  Don't yell at her on Valentine's Day.  Yeah, she's wearing red.  Don't worry about it. 
[01:32:30]  We like you.  All right, good.  It's all good.  Is there anything in it?  Because I was shaking.  Not really.  This is very strange.  What is that?  Is it April 1st?  It was supposed to be a tall, but she made a Vinci instead, and I said, oh, he wanted  a tall, and she said, oh, that's okay.  Just take this instead.  Oh, okay.  So they short-changed you.  Maybe she's even a bigger size, but let's have a coffee.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  All right.  I'll just add coffee to my foam.  Thank you.  Great coffee.  Mine's fine, sweetie.  Good. 
[01:33:00]  I'm glad you did.  Thank you for that eight ounces of chili earlier, too.  And where's my baked potato?  With cinnamon in it.  I was craving chili today, Anthony.  Yes, you are.  And let it be known, I like to go out for my own lunch, but today I'm feeling a little  under the weather, so I asked Lee if she could go get me some chili.  Help me out a little bit.  She comes back with an eight-ounce cup of chili.  It was like a shot glass of chili.  Measure out eight ounces at home.  And then they put cinnamon and cocoa in it.  Cinnamon, cocoa, and a lot of spices. 
[01:33:30]  So, I mean, my tongue was tightening up because it didn't know what to do with the flavoring.  You just want regular chili.  That's all.  And then they got to try to fancy, gussy it all up on you.  That's why I don't like those brew houses and all that crap.  I like my stuff pretty basic.  Pretty easy to get along with.  When I want chili, it's ground meat.  Right.  A few beans, a little spice in there.  Some of that chili sauce.  Make it look a little red.  Right.  That's it.  Don't start throwing cinnamon in it and thinking, you know, that's going to make it all fun and stuff. 
[01:34:00]  I'm going to be a world-class chef when someone figures this out and tastes this chili.  Right.  I just want the regular chili.  Right.  Hey, where's Joe's song as we take a break?  We got to catch up.  Brother Joe's got a great song for Valentine's Day, so listen to this.  Says it all.  Oh, hold on.  Kylie?  Yes?  Hold on.  We're going to talk to you next finally, all right?  Okay.  I really apologize.  Hold on.  No, don't worry about it.  She wants to be in the 55-gallon jump challenge early in bed.  And Daniella, contestant number 93 in the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[01:34:30]  Daniella?  Yes?  We're going to talk to you next.  Hold on, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Don't forget to vote every day for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Opie and Anthony.com.  Here's Joe's song.  A valentine for you, my beautiful wife.  For all of the years and selfless sacrifice.  For knowing how hard you work to keep our family going.  Yeah, and growing strong.  Send the kids off to school every morning at six. 
[01:35:00]  As I leave for work, you'd blow me a kiss.  But that investigator has paid off at last.  He took pictures of you while I was busting my ass.  The milkman delivered his cream in our bed.  The plumber installed his pipe in your head.  The landscaper was pulling his root as he clipped your flower. 
[01:35:30]  For hours.  The carpenter spackled your ass.  I don't doubt it.  The paper boy delivered extra.  Read all about it.  The fool guy was a pumping, a skimmer.  He was checking your suction.  Motherfucker.  The mailman had a very large package for you.  Our auto mechanic gave you a jiffy loop. 
[01:36:00]  Tyrone, our garbage man, taught you about integration.  Fiddle learned a new trick.  The missionary position.  To my wife, you big slut hoards, white skanky bitch.  Happy Valentine's Day.  No more years on the way.  Happy Valentine's Day.  No more years on the way.  Happy Valentine's Day. 
[01:36:30]  Happy Valentine's Day.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. Line.  It's there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show?  I can't even walk out there.  Jesus, man.  Yeah, Santa Cain is here.  I'm hearing rumors that Twato, there's a heart around Twato today for Valentine's Day. 
[01:37:00]  No, that's a joke, right?  That's a sick joke.  No?  Oh, God.  Twato, of course, being genital herpes.  You know, it's a disgusting growth on her pupus.  And it is, it is, you can't even look at it without a retching.  I go out there, you know, I go to take a leak. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, we'll get her in a minute or two here, okay?  And then I try to get away from her by going over by the pinball machine.  I get, hi, how are you?  Patty, who I think has Valentine's Day gifts or something.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, again, she hasn't learned.  Remember?  How many times?  Well, get Patty in here.  I want to see what she got for Valentine's Day.  Kylie, what's going on? 
[01:38:00]  Nothing much.  I really, really, really want to do the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes, you do.  All right, we're looking for ladies to impress us before we torture them.  Oh.  So, how are you going to impress us?  Uh, I don't know.  Oh, my God, you had an hour to think about it.  You were on hold for an hour.  I know, but I called on, I called last Thursday, I called on Monday, and whoever I spoke to  on Monday said that I was definitely in.  Nah, that's stupid to say, because we haven't figured out who's in here.  Yeah, I know.  You know how this works?  First of all, where are you from? 
[01:38:30]  Um, New Jersey.  All right.  And, uh, do you know of anything you could do?  For example, we have a girl coming in tomorrow, she's going to do a handstand, Norton's going  to hold her ankles, and she's going to administer a little yellow discipline.  Um, is there anything, me equally, maybe as disgusting as, uh, as that, that you could  do?  Any talent?  Uh, I'll come in and chug milk and vomit.  Hmm.  That's not bad.  That ain't bad.  How much milk is it going to take to vomit?  Um, probably not a lot. 
[01:39:00]  Uh, maybe half gallon.  What do you look like?  Uh, 5'1", 34D.  34D.  Mm-hmm.  How much do you weigh?  125.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I kind of like the drinking milk until she pukes thing.  Drinking and puking.  But you got to, like, uh, just keep chugging the milk until it happens.  Oh, yeah, no, I won't, I won't stop.  Okay.  I like that.  Yeah, we like that.  You still got to impress us with this, so if you could throw in maybe, uh, doing it naked  or some little twist to it, that'll help your chances. 
[01:39:30]  I'm heavily tattooed.  Heavily tattooed, all right.  Would you do this, like, in your panties?  No.  No?  No.  Because I'm kind of thinking that would kind of look cool to see those big Ds tense up  as she vomits.  You wouldn't do it in your panties?  No.  How are you going to get in the barrel in your panties, then?  That's a whole other day.  Yeah, you got to, uh, you got to go in the barrel in your bra and panties.  Will you vomit in your bra and panties?  Into my bra and underwear?  No, she won't wear the bra and panties.  No, will you wear bra and panties when you drink the milk and vomit? 
[01:40:00]  I won't just wear that.  Why?  Well, that's what we're talking about.  Wow, we're going to have problems with you, I think.  Yeah.  But this is what we'll do.  You come in tomorrow and you try it out, okay?  We're hoping the faithful listeners, the guys that listen, uh, you know, to us all the  time, even those days when we suck, uh, you guys pay attention to, you know, all the  girls trying to compete for our love, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And then we'll have the listeners, and we'll be part of this as well, kind of decide, uh, 
[01:40:30]  which girls we should put in the 55-gallon drums, okay?  Right.  So, we're not feeling it with you, Kylie, but, uh, come down tomorrow and we'll see  what happens.  I can come down tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  All sorts of problems.  I can come in on Monday.  Monday.  Rick, we have no other girls calling, so unfortunately we have to deal with this.  If they were coming out of the woods.  It's not unfortunate.  If we, if they were coming out of the woodworks, sure, we would have hung up on her ten minutes  ago.  You're right.  All right, how about Monday?  Monday's good.  So, that means you have the whole, well, we might not be here Monday. 
[01:41:00]  It's like a national holiday that we have to take off.  How about Tuesday?  Wednesday.  What?  I work.  Oh, God.  I work night.  Kylie, thank you so much for calling.  I can't take this anymore.  But she.  No, we, we have to draw the line.  But, but.  We have to draw the, you know why?  Opie, Opie, do you honestly think she's going to show up for the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Yes.  No, you won't.  Yes, I will.  You won't.  Yes.  But I'm, I'm making an executive decision.  I called on Thursday because I wanted to start it up again.  I understand your concerns that girls don't show up for a lot of these events that we  have, but we have to, we have to set a mark. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, but.  Once the prize comes out.  But she's.  I don't even know what I'm competing for.  All I know is I want to get in that drum because I can win it.  You don't even know what you're competing for.  Oh.  Hang up.  Hang up.  No.  Kylie, go back to the drawing board.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're looking for.  So disappointed.  We're looking for ladies.  Yes, so are we.  That are willing to impress us.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  They've got to go above and beyond to impress us.  You don't have to call us and be like, guys, I want to be in that drum.  This is what I'll do.  I'll do anything, but this is what I have in mind.  I really want to do this. 
[01:42:00]  I can.  I'll leave my house now.  I can leave my house now.  Oh, Bobby Big Rigger.  Punch out, Maverick.  Punch out.  Kylie.  Fine.  We've got to send you to the black hole.  Oh.  You're going to the cornfield.  There you go.  There she goes.  I don't know why she wouldn't do it in her panties and puke.  What's the big deal?  Yeah, I know.  I don't know.  Who hasn't?  Who hasn't been in panties and puked?  Exactly.  Touched each other.  All right.  Stalker Patty's here. 
[01:42:30]  Hi, Stalker Patty.  How are you?  Hi, Alfie.  Hi, Anthony.  How are you?  Hey, Patty.  How are you?  How's your Valentine's Day?  I just bought just a small thing for each of you for Valentine's Day.  You had a boy stuff?  What did you do?  Did you stand in the corner with a cup?  Do you see that thing she does now, which is the funniest goddamn thing?  It's her, like, embarrassed, shocked, surprised look.  I can't even describe it. 
[01:43:00]  We need, like, a picture of it.  She tenses up and her mouth opens.  Her eyes get all bug-eyed.  And then they show it.  Patty, when is your hair going to grow back?  It is growing.  You thought it was going to grow back in time for Thanksgiving.  Yeah, remember that?  We're past Thanksgiving.  It should be grown in.  Well, I meant Thanksgiving in 2002.  Look at you with jokes.  We're past Groundhog's Day at this point.  And nothing.  There's nothing going on.  You've got less hair than the groundhog.  Sometimes your hair stops growing for the rest of your head to catch up.  She looks like a young P. Townsend. 
[01:43:30]  What?  Yeah.  Like, like, wait a minute.  You're saying that sometimes your hair stops growing so the rest of the hair can catch up?  It knows to slow down so the other hairs can catch up?  You're a mental case.  But everybody's hair does that.  How's life at the shelter?  Hi, Gene.  How you up?  Good, hi, Gene.  How's life at the shelter?  Good?  I don't live in a shelter.  Sure you don't.  We saw it.  You live in a closet.  You live in a pantry.  You're in a pantry. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, that's a nice place.  And now you have no money.  You're broke.  Yet you bought Valentine's gifts.  Well, I get my 10% discount.  All right, can we see your gifts?  Sure.  All right.  So we can do this old.  Sure.  So we can do this old gag.  And one for your wedding.  Where's mine?  Jim, could you piss that you're giving me?  I'm going to bring you a next week.  Shut your face.  Just walk around.  Jim's just staring at her.  She's trying to hand it to Jim.  Jim's just staring at her like a little bit.  Free mine next week.  Don't. 
[01:44:30]  Stop.  Liqueur.  Shut it.  They're liquor truffles.  It's liqueur.  It says liqueur, not liquor.  But some have rum and some have Grand Marnier.  Grand Marnier.  Grand Marnier.  Well, Patty, all these just look fantastic.  Let me peel this open.  I tried to find a Beanie Baby to equal the one last year, but I can't find any more meanies  around, so.  Mmm. 
[01:45:00]  Chocolaty.  Do we have a little wiffle ball bat or something?  Do you have any more chocolate in there?  I'm hungry.  Any more?  Hey, I have one, Darden.  You can try one.  No, I don't want it with alcohol in it.  I can't have it with alcohol in it.  What I'm going to do is bring something for you next week.  Why next week?  Why not now?  I forgot about you.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  I was throwing the chocolate at her.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I know this bit's old, but it makes me... 
[01:45:30]  Where did that hit her?  It makes me giggle.  Oh, no!  No!  Where...  How much are these, Patty?  Um, well, for me, they...  I get them at a discount.  So how much?  They normally go for 20, but I get them for less.  How much did you pay for these, Patty?  These are very good chocolates.  About $5 each, because they get them 75% off.  Oh, my God.  So $5 that she could have spent on maybe rent... 
[01:46:00]  Or a new pillow or a sheet for her bed.  Food for that day is now being thrown around the studio.  Patty, didn't you know this was going to happen?  I know, Opie.  I don't want gifts.  I hate gifts.  You know something?  It's pretty damn good.  Good.  It's probably the most useful gift she's ever brought.  Because it has nothing to do with, like, her. 
[01:46:30]  She didn't make it.  Where's the picture frame with the noodles glued to it painted gold?  I'm afraid to bring anything with glass anymore.  Yeah, you better be.  All right.  Well, thanks for the gift there, Patty.  You're welcome.  Aren't you wondering what we got you for Valentine's Day, Patty?  Nothing.  I know.  But you're probably very used to that.  Have you ever gotten a valentine in 45 years on this planet?  Sure, from personal friends.  Like who? 
[01:47:00]  Guys?  Just friends.  Guys have given you valentines?  Well, not special ones.  No, but I've gotten them before.  Not like boyfriends or...  No.  Not really.  You've never gotten a valentine's day gift from a guy?  Well, no.  I mean, from like...  There's casual friends here and there along the way, yeah.  An uncle bought me some news, you're right.  I'm waiting in.  And buried a couple of knuckles.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  All right, Patty.  Well, happy Valentine's Day. 
[01:47:30]  There you go.  Thank you.  You too.  All right.  Now, get the...  Happy Valentine's Day.  Get out of here.  I think Jim's a little insulted that you didn't get him any.  Yeah, why didn't you get an order in something?  I apologize.  I don't care.  I really don't care.  I wouldn't have eaten it anyway.  I would have thrown it at you like Opie did.  I'm really cranky.  I don't care.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Patty.  Bye-bye, Patty.  There you go.  Just turn around and get that skinny ass out the door.  Oh, well, she's got to walk away. 
[01:48:00]  Bye-bye, buddy.  Happy Valentine's Day, Patty.  From the Valentine's.  You know, she yearns every year.  Maybe this will be the year that she'll have a special guy in her life that'll get her  a Valentine's Day card, candy, maybe a gift, and it just never happens.  Years go by.  Now she's up to 46 years, 46 Valentine's Day, nothing.  And you know something? 
[01:48:30]  Odds are she's going to go to her grave never knowing what it's like to get a Valentine  or be in love and have a special someone?  Yeah.  It's kind of sad when you think about it.  Here's what Patty's final Valentine's Day gift is going to sound like.  One to the head. 
[01:49:00]  Her own little chocolate-covered cherry brain flowing out of her skull.  Because her whole life she'll realize she'll have that one moment of clarity where she'll  wipe that retarded friggin' smile off her face and realize her life sucks.  And she's been miserable and lonely her whole life.  And end it all with that one shot to the head. 
[01:49:30]  But it ain't this year.  She's still as happy as a retard looking at a Ferris wheel.  All right, enough with Patty.  Let's talk to a hot chick.  Daniela, what's up?  Nothing.  I just wanted to thank you guys because you guys gave me a good positive reaction last week  or it was like three days ago.  And I am listening to you guys.  Oh, when did you start listening to the ONA show?  No, no, no.  You know what?  I listen, but I usually, and don't get this in the wrong way, I usually fall asleep because 
[01:50:00]  you guys are on like around my nap time before I go to work.  Unlike the other one that didn't listen.  No, no, no.  I do fall asleep.  We put her to sleep.  Another girl from Sacramento.  Mm-hmm.  Now, contestant number 93.  So, our show puts you to sleep, basically.  No, you know what?  This Nora lady last week, she pissed me off.  Oh.  Oh, yeah?  She hurt Nora.  I don't know when that lady had the last one-on-one.  She sounded really old, but she is in the Middle Ages with her brain. 
[01:50:30]  So, I don't know what was up with that.  Yeah, she's an older lady.  She used to be called the anal monster.  Well, that was way back probably.  She had to go to the doctor because her husband did some A-sacks on her.  And she was in such utter pain, which I love.  It doesn't hurt if you do it right.  So, honestly, she's really old.  So, are you into that balloon knot thing?  Oh, yeah.  Do you know what a balloon knot is?  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  Let me punch up a picture.  I'm a foreigner, but I still speak English very well. 
[01:51:00]  Where are you from?  I'm from Amsterdam.  I'm the Netherlands.  Oh, my God.  You are from Amsterdam?  Yes.  Were you one of the girls?  No.  Working girl?  No?  No.  No, no, no, no.  I'm looking at your second outfit shots right now.  Yeah, I guess you like those, huh?  Who wouldn't?  Yeah, we love your shots.  Thank you.  Maybe that Timothy gay guy, the skater, might not like these pictures, but anybody heterosexual  guy is going to like these.  Hey, is there any way I can send you guys my penthouse? 
[01:51:30]  You were in penthouse?  Yeah, I'm in the Dutch penthouse.  I'm pet of the month.  Oh, my God.  She is a penthouse model.  And you kind of listen?  I am not.  You know what?  And she kind of listens to us, Ed.  Huh?  And she kind of listens to us.  No, not kind of.  I listened.  All right.  She listens, Opie.  Well, we would love to see you.  While she's sleeping.  Well, we would love to see you in the...  Hey, that's a good thing.  Eventually, I'll dream about you guys.  We would love to see you in the Dutch penthouse.  You guys want me to send you on? 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, what do you do that you're sleeping at that hour?  Well, okay, you guys are on in New York, so, I mean, we get it in a different time.  We get it between three and seven here.  Yeah.  And I usually go to work, like, at 6.30.  And where do you work?  I work at the Ambers.  I don't know if I'm supposed to say that.  That's all right.  What's that?  It's a strip club.  Oh, you're a dancer.  Yes, I am.  Wow.  How much money do you make in a night?  Enough.  You make a lot of money. 
[01:52:30]  Give me ballpark figure there.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's not right.  You guys know not to ask those questions.  No, we don't.  We're stupid.  We won't give you the honest answer anyway.  You make a bloody fortune in a strip club.  I make good money, yes.  Where were girls like you in New Orleans?  Yeah, exactly.  See any of them.  You can afford your own trip to Hedonism.  Oh, God.  It's not even about that.  You know what?  I was kind of hesitant to do the contest, period, but then I saw Hedonism, and then I was thinking,  at first, I had a girlfriend, and I'm thinking about doing the swinging thing right now. 
[01:53:00]  So, therefore, I was like, hey, that's a nice hug.  All right.  I'm going to make my vote for the day.  Yeah.  Let me pop up the thing.  I haven't voted.  Let me see.  You guys haven't voted?  All right.  Who will I vote for?  Danielle.  Yes?  You want all my votes?  No, honey.  You've got to spread them.  I share my love.  Well, name.  You've got to do the same.  Could you make our day?  I mean, you're from Amsterdam.  You're a stripper. 
[01:53:30]  You're beautiful.  You were in Penthouse, the Dutch Penthouse.  So, how come?  I got a question for you.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Name five things we've done on our radio show.  Wow, that's hard.  Five.  Five things that what?  That we've done on this radio show.  Okay.  You have that crazy contest with the ballot or whatever you guys call that.  The ballot?  Or the barrel with the girls in there, and you guys got to do some nasty stuff.  I wanted to say something bad.  Oh, that sounds like.  Oh, that would be the 55-gallon. 
[01:54:00]  Yes.  Yes, and all the girls that are so, I mean, how, okay, my point of view is if you want  to enter this contest, and they come on the show, and they're talking to you guys, and  they're hesitant about it.  Keep looking at the picture, Opie.  It makes the talking a lot more bearable.  I know.  Oh, it's that bad, huh?  No.  No, I think it's sexy as hell, because I can hear that, like, foreign thing in there.  You can hear my accent?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, what I was trying to say is that the girls are way too hesitant.  When they call you guys, like you said, they need to know what they want.  Right.  Don't come on the radio show, and then back off when you guys ask them a couple of questions. 
[01:54:30]  That's retarded.  You know, Danielle, I got to apologize to you, because I haven't spanked to you yet.  You haven't what?  You haven't spanked to her, Opie?  What kind of, what kind of guy are you?  Okay, remember, I'm a foreigner.  You got to explain that to me.  Spanking?  Yeah, I know.  How can you spank me when I'm way over here?  Jacking?  Oh, you got to do that.  See, that's why I'm sending you guys my magazine.  You can do all that.  I really apologize.  I'm going to give you a little attention tonight. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, thank you.  Hey, I apologize.  I'll put your guys' website on, and I'll do the same.  How's that?  You show everything on that website, on Penthouse?  Mm-hmm.  Is Penthouse that version like it is here?  Well, you know, I don't really do the spread.  Oh, you don't really spread out?  No, it's very classy.  I hate the classy.  That's all right.  Doesn't that suck?  All right, so I want to see your duty spot.  Well, you got to fantasize about something. 
[01:55:30]  So there, you got it.  That's hilarious.  It's very pink.  That's all you got to know.  Ah.  And it has a piercing.  Oh, where?  In that spot where?  No, in the front, right?  No, down there.  Wait a minute.  What's pierced?  Like, you're...  Well, my...  Okay, I'll...  I'll give you some...  You're...  Wait, wait, you're...  It's very sealed, so you can't really see it.  Isn't your womanly spot pierced?  Is that what you're saying?  Yes.  Okay, not the back door. 
[01:56:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That would be a little weird.  No, no, no.  I need that space for other things.  All kinds of bacteria caught up in there.  Mm-mm.  Yum.  Tasty.  All right, let's see if she can name four other things.  All right.  55-gallon drove a gallon.  And you guys were talking about these computer games, which I have no idea what they are,  because I play my PlayStation 2, but you guys were really talking about the real computers.  What game do you play on, PlayStation 2?  Grand Theft Auto.  Oh, look at that. 
[01:56:30]  Tony Hawk.  Tony Hawk rocks.  Wow.  Yeah, that one is good.  You guys want her to listen so bad.  Anything she does, it's...  Well, you guys do that thing with the microphone where you talk.  No.  Hey, I do have a language barrier here.  Yeah.  Listen, Ant and I, boy, this is going to be tough to say.  What?  And we're going off on a little tangent, Danielle, because you were talking about video games.  Uh-huh.  But, you know, a lot of people, I guess, respect Ant and I's opinions for whatever reason. 
[01:57:00]  Uh-huh.  And, uh, well, um, we got a copy of, uh, State of Emergency.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, yeah.  And it comes out, I guess, tomorrow, and we had to sign all sorts of, uh, paperwork to  get this advanced, uh, copy.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  And, uh...  Huh.  Uh-huh.  I got to, I got to fairly critique, uh, the game.  It's not good?  Well, a lot of these gaming companies at this point, they're just assuming, you know, they  give us a game, we're going to just give it rave reviews, and, you know, that'll help,  uh, sales. 
[01:57:30]  But the people, then, will not respect our opinion of, uh, games.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, like we said, Grand Theft Auto 3, probably the best platform game ever made.  Don't you love the cussing?  I love the game.  It's great.  I just think it's great.  Yeah, we love Grand Theft Auto 3.  But, but, uh...  I learned all my bad words from that game.  State of Emergency, I think a lot of people, uh, and me included, were expecting it to be similar  to Grand Theft Auto 3, and it's not.  Which they warned us about.  Yeah.  It was, uh, it was fun to play, but I know it's, uh, it's gonna, I'm gonna lose interest 
[01:58:00]  really fast.  Yeah, it's not, um, I don't know, I couldn't get into the action that much.  Uh, it seemed a little repetitive.  You know what I mean?  There wasn't a lot of, uh, options to, to do things.  There wasn't a lot of interaction with the crowd.  You could beat them up and everything, but there just seemed to be so many better ways to  kill people in Grand Theft Auto 3.  Uh-huh.  Uh, than this one.  This one, I don't know, you go around, you can beat stuff, you can break windows, you 
[01:58:30]  can break property, but it's like, eh.  But after that, after doing that for a while, you're going, okay, what else, what else can  I do?  I don't like, I like the fact...  And realize, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.  I like the fact that you can go beat up costs in Grand Theft Auto 3.  Well, isn't that always fun, Daniela?  Jesus, man.  Okay, so...  So that's our review of, uh, State of Emergency, kind of like...  I was left a little flat.  Let's leave that as my quote.  Left a little flat.  Do you guys like Final Fantasy?  I give it, uh, I give it two joysticks. 
[01:59:00]  You give it two controllers?  I give it, I give it two, yeah.  I give it two controllers.  Two out of five?  Yeah.  Yeah, two out of five controllers.  Oof.  You know, um, do you play any computer games, Daniela, or just, uh, PlayStation?  Um, see, yeah, mostly PlayStation.  Yeah.  I play Flipside, which is just kind of retarded.  It's Domino's, but, you know...  Domino's, there you go.  It keeps, it keeps the time going if I'm really bored.  I'd watch it if she was doing it naked.  Yeah, see, mostly, I'm usually doing everything naked. 
[01:59:30]  Breast jiggling.  Yeah, not even using her hands with us.  I usually do everything naked.  You do, do you?  I was about to take you guys in the shower, but, you know, didn't want to get all static  in there.  Well, why don't you just, uh, why don't you go in the shower as we continue, uh, talking  to you?  Okay.  We don't care about the static.  You don't care?  You can kind of, yeah, just keep the phone dry.  Make sure the phone has a cord on it, too.  Oh, that's nice.  Hold on.  Make some toast.  I'm getting undressed.  Hold on.  By the way, uh, contestant number three in the Naughty Nighty contest is, uh, getting 
[02:00:00]  undressed right now, Ann.  Yeah, yeah.  You hear the shower?  We hear the shower.  Do you hear it or not?  Yes, I do.  And now you're naked?  Yes, I am.  She is complete.  Let's punch up the pictures of Daniela right now.  Naked in the shower.  And now I'm looking at her.  She is now naked.  It's hot.  Yes, it is, isn't it?  Yeah, turn off all the cold.  Scald yourself.  So, I'm really just hoping to hear a little slip and the thud of skull on tile. 
[02:00:30]  Sick, sick, sick man.  Yeah.  Hey, could you soap up your, uh, your, your bed place?  What would you want me to do?  Take the soap, right?  Yes.  And lather up your back door.  Really good.  I'm holding you between my neck and my ear right now so I can do that for you.  And your ear.  And then, uh, when it's all lathered up, put the phone down there as you work your hand.  You guys are nuts.  Yeah, we are.  Yeah.  Okay.  We're in her ear. 
[02:01:00]  Hold on.  All right, soap it up and then let's hear.  Hey, guys, we're in her ear.  I like being in your ear.  In her ear.  Yes, her ear.  In her ear.  Ear.  All soaped up?  Yeah, hold on, because I'm not trying to get soap on the, on the phone.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Let's listen.  Can you hear that?  Get closer.  Get closer.  I don't want soap in there.  Get it closer.  That's not good.  No, just get a little closer and, like, make some more noise with your hand.  Hold on.  All right.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  There.  I kind of heard a little bit, but I don't think that went out.  I want you to do it.  I want to hear a peanut fall out and hit the phone.  It rubs lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  Okay.  All right.  So she's now making the shower in.  Yeah.  Hey, could you, let's just say, clean the Brillo pad?  Clean the what?  Clean the Brillo pad, as Opie so eloquently put it.  Um, I told you guys I was from Holland, right? 
[02:02:00]  Well, certain words, the slang that you guys use, it's really not clear to me.  Do you, um...  That's not because I'm stupid.  It's just because I don't understand that.  All right.  Daniela, I'll translate for you.  Yes.  Clean your snatch.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There.  They're going to...  What happened to the phone?  Daniela.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  What happened to your phone?  Nothing.  Did you just get water in your phone? 
[02:02:30]  No.  It sounds all effed up.  It does.  Hold on.  Let me get the other phone.  All right.  She's going to go get the other phone.  I think she got water in it and didn't know.  That's great.  That's good.  No, I didn't get your hand out of your pants.  All right.  Daniela, go get the other phone so we can continue with the shower.  Yes.  You're still in the shower?  Yes.  Well, that sounds better.  Yes.  Soap up your ass again.  Well, I don't want to get water in the phone again.  Well, we don't care.  Go ahead.  Do it.  You don't care?  Yeah.  This phone sounds better. 
[02:03:00]  Have her do the Brulopet thing.  All right.  Do the front.  Okay.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Get closer.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I heard that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, lather it up.  So she's wet, soapy, and naked.  You're nice and naked in 18 cities right now.  That's good.  All right.  So how many things does she know about the show already?  Two or three?  She knows two. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  Three more to go.  Three more to go and we'll feel like rock stars.  No, you guys said four.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Then you guys were talking about the fact that you thought the girls weren't listening  and all the back to the high school flashbacks about girls that were too pretty and what  did you guys think if you go up to the girls and all that good stuff?  Well, I got to tell you this.  When I was in high school, you were not like me at all.  So, I mean.  I understood what she was saying when we were talking about the hot girls and thinking they 
[02:04:00]  wanted us and it turns out they didn't.  Exactly.  And they didn't even know we existed.  I think she's thinking of stuff that were all done in a 15-minute window.  Shut up, Anthony.  All right.  Give us something else.  The guy could dream, Katie.  The reason that you guys got shut down in New Orleans.  Why was that?  Because some girl was, God, how do you say that in proper English, not getting in trouble?  Well, we didn't get shut down.  We almost got shut down.  We almost got shut down.  All right.  She was doing what girls do to prevent their teeth from being punched. 
[02:04:30]  When girls do what they do best, they get in trouble or they get you guys in trouble,  right?  All right.  All right.  Something tells me she doesn't listen a lot.  Shut up.  I do.  God, I just don't want to say all these rude things on the phone.  Right.  I'm going to go out on a limb.  I think she listens more than Dan from Hoboken, Anthony.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Basically, God.  Okay.  She was trying to put something in her mouth and she was going to get you guys in trouble 
[02:05:00]  and you guys said, no, don't do it.  How about you say it in Dutch for us?  Okay.  So, build the annuli little side.  We got annuli side in May.  Wow.  That's a wacky little language you got going for yourself.  I heard in May.  Nay.  That means no.  Oh, all right.  Very good.  Well, we like Daniella.  Contestant number 93 in the Naughty 90 contest.  Thank you.  Not bad.  All right.  Not bad at all.  Thank you.  Good luck with the voting and have fun with your little shower, all right?  And once again, thank you very much for giving props to Sacramento. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, don't you worry.  Okay.  You guys have a good day.  Happy Valentine's.  Oh, you too, Daniella.  Oh, and by the way, I wanted to say bye to Leon because he did a really good job.  Ugh, we hate Leon.  No, don't be like that, you guys.  I love you guys, too.  There you go.  Hey, Daniella, have you seen our pictures on the website?  Yes.  Who do you think is the cutest?  Oh, would you stop?  Oh, that's not fair.  Jesus.  You know, I switch from you guys.  Huh?  Like, one day it's, you know, Opie, the other day it's Anthony. 
[02:06:00]  Right, there you go.  All right.  Opie, do you think of this contestant?  And it's never Jim Norton.  Let me turn this around.  Opie, do you think if this contestant was on the phone, we'd have stayed on this long?  No.  Okay.  Just checking.  Unless she was washing her body with a knife.  Oh, my God.  You guys are brutal.  Yes.  Please send the Dutch penthouse.  I will.  I will.  Is the address on the website?  Send it immediately.  Oh, look, Rick wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Okay.  I'm sure Rick wants to talk to us.  Penthoose. 
[02:06:30]  Penthoose.  Send the penthoose.  The penthouse.  Danielle, I got to tell you, you're our new favorite broad on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, thank you.  It changes quite often, but for now, you're the same.  It changes quite often.  Yeah, I figured that.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Danielle.  Hold on.  Thank you.  There she goes.  Danielle.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hey, it's Valentine's Day.  We're breaking out our love songs today, Anthony.  Love songs.  Here's another one for you. 
[02:07:00]  Well, it's not on the CD because it's kind of a special song.  It's not on the CD because it sucks?  That would seem to follow, wouldn't it?  No, it's actually not a very funny song.  It's a...  Uh-oh.  If you don't mind, my wife and I were recently divorced.  You're 12.  I know.  You're 12.  It's a short marriage.  Okay.  Okay.  How old are you?  I'm 27.  27?  All right.  Yeah.  And my wife of 16 years, Erin, got divorced recently, and we have a little six-year-old girl. 
[02:07:30]  And she doesn't really understand why Mommy isn't living with us anymore, and I did my  best to write this little lullaby and perhaps explain it to her.  I like the setup.  It's great.  Thanks.  Okay.  I'm going to bring it down a little bit here.  You know what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tonight.  Daddy's here, and he'll sing you a soft lullaby.  Tonight.  Why can't it all be like it was before?  How can I explain 
[02:08:30]  Why mommy's not here anymore  Cause daddy likes porno and ten dollar whores  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores  Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus  I think that's why your mommy left us  Pretty 
[02:09:00]  Hush little girl  There is no reason to fret  Tonight  Don't mind the smoke  Daddy just wants to forget  Tonight  Soon it will all be like it was before 
[02:09:30]  Any minute  She will walk through that front door  But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer  Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear  Daddy has sores on his genitals  Oozing with  I think that's why your mommy left us 
[02:10:00]  Please don't cry  I swear  To be here by your side  Right after daddy gets home from the bar  Visits his bookie and steals a new car 
[02:10:30]  He'll drive to the strip club  And if daddy plays his cards right  He'll bring home your new mommy tonight  Lay-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee- 
[02:11:00]  Jack is.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Make it touch her.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Cut in with a caller on the line. 
[02:11:30]  This is something we might have to try, Wink Wink.  Oh, I hope so.  The DJ tells the caller to go crazy.  Go crazy.  That's when the caller repeats the word bang over and over.  Like, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Like he goes crazy with the word bang?  Yeah, he makes it a little crazy.  That's only funny if you're driving down 7th Avenue hitting pedestrians and chink bike messengers. 
[02:12:00]  Great local reference today, my friend.  That's when that's funny.  Yeah, another guy with a car running over people twice in three days.  This garbage goes on for like 45 seconds while the song plays in the background.  Then another gets to go.  Another?  Like he takes another call and they get to go crazy?  All right, enough from you.  Let's give someone else a chance.  Chance to go crazy.  Wow.  Craig writes, it's effing embarrassing to listen to. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, I'm crazy.  Look, I'm running back and forth in the studio.  Oh, Anthony.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was wondering if I can go crazy, you guys.  I knew you, bastards.  Well, all right, hold on.  We need to line up all the people that want to go crazy.  Yeah, because we need a few people that are going to go crazy.  I want to hear how this would sound.  This would sound?  All right, let me set this whole damn thing up. 
[02:13:00]  Who wants to go crazy?  Well, man, we only have one person that wants to go crazy.  We can't go crazy with one person.  Only one person wants to go crazy.  No way.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  I'm surprised because this is a great benchmark of the show.  I know.  You're supposed to have to Hokey Radio?  Yeah.  And I just got in the car, I turned on, I had Q for some reason on.  Yeah.  And whoever the dick was that was on it, right, right, reads two consecutive Valentine's greetings.  One from Donna to her boyfriend, Jimmy, then from Donna to her husband, John. 
[02:13:30]  Then he goes, ho, ho, that's going to make for some real trouble tonight if it's the same Donna.  And, oh, by the way, guys, that's the same guy that ran over everybody.  Thank you, Jason.  Later.  And thanks for supporting the show and listening to us.  Yeah, right?  You bastard.  No.  I was listening to the Q.  Well, thanks.  We want to hear your listening to us.  How's that?  That's ridiculous.  John, what's up?  What's up?  I want to go crazy.  You want to go crazy?  Yeah, I'm nuts. 
[02:14:00]  All right, hold on, John.  He's nuts, you.  Hold on.  We'll let John go crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see what Chris wants.  Now, obviously, they would do this behind the scenes.  They would screen the callers that want to go crazy and line them up.  They'll probably even ask for, like, a little sample of them going crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Open Anthony.  Hey, what's up, man?  I want to go crazy, man.  You don't sound like you're going to go too crazy, though.  I want to go crazy.  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang.  All right. 
[02:14:30]  He's in.  He impressed.  Bang, bang, bang.  He sounds crazy.  All right, let's start it up, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  It's time to go crazy.  It's time to go crazy.  Anthony.  Hey, what's up, man?  I'm ready to go nuts.  All right, here we go.  Go crazy.  Bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  I'm crazy.  I'm crazy.  Bang.  All right.  All right. 
[02:15:00]  All right, John.  It's time to go crazy.  All right.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.  Listen to me.  I'm mad.  Bang, bang, bang.  See you.  I'm crazy.  This is crazy.  Wow.  This is unbelievable.  We got Tom on the phone.  Tom.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Your turn to go crazy.  I'm ready to go crazy.  Go.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang. 
[02:15:30]  The team's gone crazy.  Bang, bang.  Hey, wait.  I'm a Jew.  You're on the phone.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang.  It is a wall.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Ralph wants to go crazy.  Ralph, you're on the phone.  Go crazy.  I've been waiting for this all day.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.  Oh, man.  I'm going crazy over here.  This is the lamest bitch.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[02:16:00]  This is true.  Hold on, though.  Why?  They're not doing it right.  Why?  They have to go bang, bang, bang when it says bang in the song.  Oh.  I don't know.  I think they're so crazy that they're doing the bang, bang, bang when they're not supposed  to be bang, bang, bang.  Ours is even crazier than I would say.  This is the dumbest bitch.  All right.  Go ahead, Ralph.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Bang, bang, bang.  I'm going crazy.  You're crazy, Ralph.  I'm getting cars going crazy. 
[02:16:30]  Bang, bang, bang.  Come on.  Bang, bang with me.  All right.  Thank you, Ralph.  Let's get a foreigner because maybe he'll pronounce bang a little differently.  Ho, ho.  Let's spice it up the bin a little bit.  Here's Horatio.  Horatio, what's up?  I want to go crazy.  Go ahead, Horatio.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  He's not too crazy.  Bang.  All right, Horatio.  Look at what I'm seeing on instant feedback. 
[02:17:00]  Matt from Boston going crazy in print.  Look.  He's printed bang, bang, bang.  That's insane.  All right.  One more.  Matt.  Matt, go crazy.  I want to go crazy.  By the way, O&A, also, one other thing.  Yeah, God.  Got a little breaking news here, a little update to Norton's look.  This is a typical reference.  All right.  The guy who did the hit and runs on 7th Avenue, apparently they're saying it's the same guy 
[02:17:30]  and he just turned himself in.  So it was the same guy from the other day?  Yeah, he did it twice.  Both cars were stolen from the same apartment building with Secaucus, too.  We had the guy, we told you guys, I think.  They just exactly broke this.  I think two days ago he ran over like 18 people in Midtown right around Penn Station and then  today he did it again.  Yeah, he got seven today, though.  I think he's losing his aim.  Oh, my God.  Why did he turn himself in?  They're not saying.  They're just saying he went, turned himself in, confessed to everything, police took him 
[02:18:00]  into custody.  I think he turned himself in in Jersey.  I didn't hear the whole thing.  Wow.  Is it because he didn't realize that tickets for my shows went on sale tomorrow?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Tickets go on sale for the Yellow Discipline Tour tomorrow?  In what cities, Jim?  Well, I really didn't want to plug this, but Philly, New York, and Buffalo tomorrow at  noon and Boston and Cleveland tomorrow at 10.  Ticketmaster for all except Boston, which is next ticketing.  Nice.  You're lucky he's not listening that he turned himself in, otherwise he might have aimed for 
[02:18:30]  you for that plug whore.  Later, O&A.  Go get the tickets.  They're going to sell out, I'm telling you.  It's going to be a hot ticket.  Go to eatabullet.com for concert details for Jim Norton, okay?  I kind of thought it was the same guy because it was the same MO.  He'd hit the people and then ditch the car and run into the subway.  And it was a white guy, 30, like in his mid to late 30s or something.  He's 39.  And, boy, imagine, though, they didn't catch him or he didn't give himself in.  How sick is that to have, like, a serial run-over people guy? 
[02:19:00]  You know, you'd be horrified walking the street.  It's great, though, because pedestrians just walk out there without looking.  I wish this guy never got caught.  People would really mind their P's and Q's when they were walking, and I'm trying to make  a right.  You know something?  I cannot stand the frigging pedestrians in this city.  Because they are retarded.  You know, in all my days of walking in Manhattan, I have never stepped out in front of a moving  vehicle that has a green light. 
[02:19:30]  But for some reason, while I'm driving, it's common practice.  And then when you lay on that frigging horn and steer close enough to him to brush your  mirror on his face, they look at you like you're the a-hole.  I want to frigging hit these people.  The ones that, you know, and if I'm coming to the intersection and they're on this corner  waiting to cross and they decide they have enough time to cross, feel free, man.  God bless you.  Good luck.  Have fun running.  Don't frigging stroll like you own the goddamn street and walk and then give me the look 
[02:20:00]  like, oh, what are you doing speeding through the intersection?  Because I got the green light.  See, it says don't walk.  If you want to run, good.  Run.  Go ahead.  You got to be somewhere.  I got to be somewhere.  Run.  Just don't get my way.  Well, you actually slow down and let them go.  If they're running, you're like, okay, go ahead.  No problem.  I'll steer up to the side a little.  I don't really have to break my stride.  Guys?  Yeah.  I'm enjoying the cute banter, but we're in the middle of our going crazy bit.  You could have played the tune because I was going a little crazy. 
[02:20:30]  Norton went crazy.  But the cute banter break is supposed to happen at 6.20.  Damn it.  We're not following the format clock.  Yeah.  That was given to us.  How are we going to compete?  Can we continue with the...  We're going to follow the clock.  Can we continue with the bang, going crazy bit?  Do we have anyone that's still going crazy?  I think Josh wants to go crazy.  Josh!  Do the car, Josh.  It's going crazy.  It's too late to go.  Go crazy. 
[02:21:00]  He's crazy.  There you go.  He went crazy.  What station does this?  I want to give him a plug.  98.5.  Oh, that's the KISS station for Boston.  Every station has to have a KISS station.  Oh, it's the KISS station.  It's the KISS station.  Every city has a KISS station.  Yeah, it has a KISS station.  And this is it?  This is exactly what happens?  You know, I'm getting a little pissed off because Matt on Line 8 says the crazy bit better than the 6 o'clock queef bit.  Damn it. 
[02:21:30]  The crazy.  We're getting out-trumped in radio bits by a KISS station.  Unbelievable.  Jeff, what's going on?  Not much, guys.  The guys doing the banging, they got it right on because they sound just like the idiots who do it on Friday night.  Oh, you've heard this?  I've heard it.  All you need is gay Marco going, woo, party for the weekend.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  It's horrible, man.  All right, well.  Thank God you're back in Boston because radio sucks around here without you. 
[02:22:00]  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang to you.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  It's all your friends there.  Later, guys.  All right, Jeff.  Evan from New York saying Friday Bang Bang, the best radio bit ever.  And he says it's on the AP, so it's got to be true.  Well, look at Vito who are confusing our listeners.  Yes, Vito?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I'm trying to get the new format down.  Is this bang, bang, bang going to be on before or after the 6 o'clock week?  It's got to be before.  I need to know.  But you know what?  The bang, bang, bang, bang, crazy bit.  We can only do it on Fridays because that's when people kind of loosen their tie and get 
[02:22:30]  a little crazy.  Yeah, a little crazy.  Bang, bang, bang.  The whole office is going down to Bennigan's.  Ho-ho.  Meet us down there.  We'll have a couple.  Knock a few back.  I feel like the bit didn't work as well today because it's Thursday, you know?  Tomorrow, this bit is going to kill.  You know, happy hour has begun.  People are like, wow, the weekend.  You'll feel it.  The weekend, I can drink and party.  T-G-I-F?  Hey, T-G-I-F.  With a little bang, bang.  So I think the 6 o'clock queef is safe because we'll do the bang, bang, you know, every Friday. 
[02:23:00]  I love it.  But you don't have to tell people when it's going to be.  You just spring it on them because it's crazy and they don't know when it's coming.  That'd be crazy.  All of a sudden, it's Friday.  That song starts up out of nowhere and the phones probably go crazy.  Is that how they do it?  They just start it.  They don't say, hey, we're looking for crazy people.  They just start the song and then crazy people call, I bet.  Well, stupid rubes that listen to that type of radio need to know when it's going to be every single day.  Is that it?  Yes.  So if they say it's at 6 o'clock and they do it at 6.20 or 5.40, they're going to be a little pissed. 
[02:23:30]  What time tomorrow?  What if they tune in late and they miss, well, they're tuning in early and you're,  they already did the bit, they're going to be men because they were waiting for the bit.  That's true.  Okay, what time are we going to do it tomorrow?  I don't know.  The bang, bang.  Five on the button.  Well, stay tuned.  Stay tuned.  Hey, this is a really good reference from Ian.  Ian, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Yeah, you suppose the guy who's mowing down the pedestrians was listening to Lips 106 or Head Radio. 
[02:24:00]  Can you play my Grand Theft Auto 3 clip over there?  Because I don't have it.  Which one?  I love that one.  The one you played yesterday.  Good one, Ian.  Thank you.  This guy.  All right.  Hey, it's time for commercials.  I love them.  B-B-B-A-O.  All right.  We got to get Dr. Katz, Andy Kane, and Stark and Patty in the studio.  And he's going to smell their breaths and stuff.  He's going to do some kind of a wacky diagnosis.  Yeah.  Just by their breath. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But before that, though, we got another little song for Valentine's Day.  Our love songs today.  Love songs.  I had to see you one last time.  There's something on my mind.  How do I say what needs to be said?  The words are hard to find.  How about, bitch, give me my money? 
[02:25:00]  I want my money and I want it fast.  Hey, bitch, give me my money.  Else I'm about to take it out your ass.  I want my money and I want my money and I want my money and I want my money and I want you to be a little tiny thing. 
[02:25:30]  That's funny.  That was a clip from Anthony, the retarded half of the Open Anthony Show.  All right, Rick, go get Dr. Kat, Sandy Kane, and Stalker Patty as we continue the Open Anthony Show.  Judy's on the line.  Judy, what's up? 
[02:26:00]  Oh, not a hell of a lot.  What are you doing?  What do you mean?  I can't believe you guys make me crack up all the way home and I can't figure out how you're doing today.  Oh, where are you calling from?  Delaware.  Oh, okay.  Delaware?  We're not...  Outside of Philadelphia.  Yeah, I can hear you.  I think we're kind of doing one of those silly shows today.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Being a little wacky.  Every once in a while we get a little silly.  All right.  All right?  Yeah.  I'm sorry we didn't...  It doesn't matter.  I'm sorry we didn't entertain you today.  I look forward to cracking up and...  Oh, boy. 
[02:26:30]  You didn't like the wacky song?  Oh, well, it was okay.  Bitch, Give Me My Money was good.  Which one?  Oh, all right.  So you got a chuckle.  But you didn't like the wacky song with the people going crazy?  No, sorry.  I wish I could say, yeah, but...  That's our new bit.  That's our new bit.  We were really excited.  We were really banking on that one.  Debuting that bit today.  Yeah, right.  We were really banking on that.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Well, now you can listen for the last half hour of the show.  For the best part of the show.  And be disgusted. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, well, that's okay.  Every day, man.  I'm glad I have bad breath, boy.  They put me right next to the doctor.  All right, thanks, Judy.  I came equipped.  Just ate garlic and onions.  You said bad breath?  Bad breath.  That's good you put out a cassette, too.  That's very with the times.  A cassette.  And you want to describe...  Hey, shut up.  Two tracks.  Shut up.  Sandy Kane is a...  Thank you, Ed.  Sandy Kane is an old vaudevillian.  Do I dare say broad?  She's an old broad.  She's an old broad from the old days. 
[02:27:30]  She's an old school stripper from 42nd Street.  The old days of New York City, before Giuliani cleaned it up.  It's not that long.  It's about four years.  Well, for you, it was many, many years ago when you were dancing on 42nd Street.  Roy Campanella had legs.  Who?  Roy Campanella.  Oh, right.  Yes.  Always funny.  I didn't know who not.  Okay.  Yeah, thanks for...  Yeah, whore.  Thanks for relating to our audience.  Well, they said...  The woman didn't like your show.  If you had me on sooner, she probably would have liked it. 
[02:28:00]  I don't care what that bitch thinks.  And Dr. Katz.  He's funnier than you today.  All right, listen.  So, she's been ridden hard and put up wet, as they say.  Yeah.  And she's got warts that we name.  Yeah, I mean, I did.  I painted Twato for you today.  She has a huge...  It's a Valentine's Day show.  It looks like a conjoined twin.  We think it looks like Quato from Total Recall.  But because of certain different locations, we've dubbed it Twato.  Yeah.  And it is this huge, ear-like-looking, genital wart thing that is right... 
[02:28:30]  Don't say...  Sandy Kane, shut the F up.  Sandy, you keep saying things you're not supposed to say.  You do this every time.  Don't say anything.  We know what we're doing.  We're responsible broadcasters.  Don't say anything.  You crack core, shut up.  Stop.  How do you know I do crack?  Shut up.  You like the crack?  Ben's over.  Opie, what's wrong?  You have PMS today? 
[02:29:00]  What's wrong with you, man?  You're so, like, you know, so, like, so wacky and goofy, man.  What's wrong with you, baby?  Oh, no.  It's Valentine's Day.  Oh, no, no.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  Do you know...  Oh, my God.  Opie just took a big swig of water and spit it right in her face.  That's really sexy.  Wow. 
[02:29:30]  Right in her face.  Wyatt.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Oh, my God.  I bought a fight.  I like that.  You like that?  Yeah.  Would you do it a little lower now?  And Twado has a friend in the back area.  Yeah.  A couple friends.  Sandy's used to that.  Only it's thicker and white.  Oh, my God.  And it was diagnosed as genital warts.  Yeah.  Really?  How do you not get that fixed, though?  Why don't you get the...  How do you not...  Honey, you should see it today.  You should see it.  All right.  We're going to see in a second. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, we'll see in a second.  Oh, girl.  We got a song from Q, Anthony.  Remember Q?  Yeah, Q.  Old friend of the O&A show?  Yep, yep.  He came up with the Sandy Cain song.  Let's hear.  She walks in the room.  You can smell her stank.  Who's her favorite geriatric skank?  Sandy Cain.  Sandy Cain.  She's insane.  That's Sandy Cain.  She's got a cable show.  No one wants to watch.  What the hell's that ugly thing that's growing on her grouch? 
[02:30:30]  Who always acts like a retard?  No.  Ow.  Who'll never get your Johnson heart?  No.  Who should we bury in the yard?  Ow.  That skank.  Oh, me?  Yeah, you.  She's got anal warts and varicose veins.  She's got an evil twin.  And what a wizard's name is Sandy Cain.  Sandy Cain. 
[02:31:00]  She's insane.  And what a pain.  So stay away from her.  You don't know what you'll catch.  What is that disgusting thing that's hanging from her crotch?  What was that?  I didn't hear that.  Oh, don't worry about it.  Everyone else.  What was that, Nick?  Can I have a copy of that?  You know, he's ripping off my Reverend Al theme.  I used the same song for the Reverend Al song.  Reverend Al.  All right.  So, Sandy.  That was great.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Sandy? 
[02:31:30]  Oh, my God.  Yes, O.P.?  So, let's see Twato today.  Okay.  That's Dr. Katz, by the way.  Hey, Mr. Katz.  This is Dr. Katz.  Yeah, I've got my smelling machine here.  What type of doctor are you, sir?  I'm a dentist.  I have a degree in bacteriology.  Oh, you do, do you?  I specialize in bad breath.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not the psychiatrist cartoon guy.  That's a different, that's my cousin.  Right.  How come he was smelling Twato before, though?  No.  I don't think I was.  All right.  Please, Sandy.  Back up.  Back way up.  Go buy the CDs.  Look at the spit kind of just dripping off her forehead. 
[02:32:00]  It's awful.  Now, go there.  I am a professional.  Expose Twato.  Okay.  Dr. Katz, you've never seen anything like this, I guarantee.  Okay.  Let's find out.  And the fact that you look like Dabney Coleman will not help.  The double Ds, they're getting in the way.  Yeah, the double Ds.  There she goes.  Look at this thing, Doc.  It's painted?  What is that?  She painted it red. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, my God.  She painted the whole thing red.  It looks like an organ.  Rick, get a freaking picture of that.  Rick, get a close-up of that.  She painted her genital ward red.  She painted her God damn.  It looks like a heart.  She painted her genital ward red so it looks like a heart.  Stinky, get in here.  It's so big.  You should have hired a Puerto Rican to do that.  Dr. Katz, what do you think?  I've never seen anything like that.  No.  I guess not.  Not even in Hollywood. 
[02:33:00]  Nope.  He painted it.  Yeah.  Let, um...  Isn't it a perfect heart?  It's in the shape of a heart.  It's disgusting.  It's more like a trapezoid.  Let Rick...  No, stay there.  Stay there, Sam.  Stay there, please.  Too close.  Please stay there.  Get some of it.  Let, um...  Let Rick take a picture of...  You want to get this thing?  Oh, God.  Wait till you see this on foundrymusic.com later tonight.  How desperate would you have to be, Norton, to put it there?  Don't you understand that's an impossibility? 
[02:33:30]  It's impossible, right?  I would never let you take my genital ward from me, Kay.  Don't you understand that's impossible?  That's impossible.  That could never happen.  All right, Rick is taking a picture of...  It's the way Twato wanted it.  It's the way I wanted it.  What about the girl over there?  No.  She's not Rosie O'Donnell.  Oh, Twato, you won't see him no more.  All right, Rick is taking some shots of Twato that is decorated for Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  Yeah, very festive. 
[02:34:00]  It's a medical hour.  You know what it looks like?  Yeah, see?  We're talking about medical things, Doc.  It looks like a dried, red riverbed.  Oh, Sandy.  All cracking and all those heart-shaped candies they give up for Valentine's Day.  Dr. Katz, that's the real deal, though.  That is a genital wart.  It should have a little witty thing written on it, like hubba hubba.  Thank you for introducing me.  Happy Valentine's Day, guys.  Like love?  It should have something like love written on it.  Hey, Sandy, you want the doctor to look at your teeth?  Because he is a dentist.  He is a dentist. 
[02:34:30]  I could check her breath.  I could find out if she's fresh.  What do you think, Sandy?  I'm sure it's not.  Show your teeth to the doctor first.  Your tongue.  Your tongue tells the whole story.  If your tongue is white.  Well, I'm sure it's not good.  Well, I...  And I was rushing over here.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This is Sandy.  Sandy, you can't say that.  Show the doc your bottom teeth.  Can you say hummer?  Show the doc your bottom teeth.  Just show him.  I'm just saying, in New Orleans, you're showing...  Sandy!  Show the doc your bottom teeth.  Go ahead.  I was talking to him. 
[02:35:00]  Show him.  Pull your lip down.  Show him.  Show him.  Maybe he can help you.  Show him.  Let me take a look.  All right, she's hurting.  Take a look.  I am beyond hell.  Sandy, pull down your goddamn lip.  You're missing a couple of things there.  Yes.  Pull it down.  Well, a dentist...  Somebody plug you?  No, a dentist mutilated me.  Really?  Yes.  A dentist mutilated her.  Dentist did it.  Take a team of lumberjacks with axes to mutilate you as much as you are mutilated.  A dentist couldn't possibly do. 
[02:35:30]  Never mess around with a dentist.  Because don't they...  Aren't they sick people usually?  No.  He's a dentist.  I think so.  You're calling him sick people.  Not that comparable to things I...  You painted your genital wart red.  And you're calling him sick.  No, I've heard a lot of horror stories about dentists who put patients to sleep, fondle  them, etc.  You have nothing to worry about.  Oh, God.  Keep me to it.  Very good.  Maybe if he injected Novocaine into his own brain, he might then have some kind of a seizure 
[02:36:00]  that might make him fall on you, but...  No, they are sick people.  I still say dentists are sick people.  All right, all right.  Right.  Even your doctors.  All right.  Dr. Katz.  Yes.  Yes.  It's to you.  We're running out of time.  Okay.  So let us know what your little gadget is there.  Yeah, okay.  This is called a helimiter.  It measures bad breath.  A helimiter.  With my helimiter, I'll rule the world.  Well, actually, when I started treating bad breath back in 1993, I treated like 13,000  people to the clinics, but we came up with a formula now that you don't have to come  and see me in California. 
[02:36:30]  Okay.  Use the stuff, and it gets rid of your bad breath.  All right.  Now, how does this little gadget work?  Oh, okay.  It has a little suction device on there.  Not called Sandy.  Look at him.  He's making jokes.  And it actually measures the amount of sulfur that's in your breath.  Sulfur makes the bad breath.  Exactly.  There's bacteria in the back of your tongue, and they produce sulfur.  So when your mouth is drier, your breath gets worse because the bugs produce more sulfur  compounds.  Right.  Which, so anything above 100 means your breath isn't that hot.  Anything above 100.  Yes.  So I brought a couple of straws here. 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Give Sandy a little test run with your machine.  All you have to do is take your tongue out and hold your breath.  Like that.  Can I just say one thing?  Yeah.  And I want to be honest, and this is what I love about O.P. and Anthony.  They always bring me out of the closet.  I've had bad breath all my life.  All right.  Well, whatever.  Let's find out.  Let's find out.  I know.  It's bad.  Sandy.  Sandy.  High-protein diets will give you bad breath.  I want you to know.  High-protein diets.  Dairy foods.  All right, you can figure out what they jumped out.  We'll give you bad breath.  All right.  Sandy, shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Just stand there. 
[02:37:30]  Listen to the doctor.  Act that.  Stick it out.  Now, don't move.  Stick it out.  Don't move.  Okay.  Stay just like that.  Keep it out.  Stay just like that.  Don't move.  There's going to be a comma in this.  Stay like that.  Okay.  Let's see where we end up.  All right.  What is it?  The high you had was 43.  Not bad.  That's not bad.  Not bad.  You're kidding.  No, you're cured.  Well, you don't have much sulfur in there.  Not bad.  Who wants the straw?  Oh, God.  I wouldn't if I could eat it.  You have a nuclear waste here. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, please.  Sherry for medicine writes, if the doctor smells Norton, will he come up with HIV and baby powder?  I have a problem that way.  You know?  It's ruined my sex life.  Get, um...  All right.  So, Doc, she doesn't have bad breath, huh?  No, no.  Can you check Twoto now?  Can you put it down there?  What are you doing later?  No, I'm just saying.  I'll go and get laid tonight.  Not here.  Jeez, man.  Really?  I have a very big problem like that.  The only place you should be laid is in a grave.  Look at you.  Who wants to be tested next? 
[02:38:30]  Stalker Patty.  Stalker Patty.  Boy, this bit is really good.  It's really exciting.  It's crazy.  Okay.  Keep it all the way out.  There we go.  Oh, just seeing her tongue.  Really far.  Look at that virgin tongue.  Shove it in her throat.  Shove it down her throat.  Make her gag.  Look at her little mouth.  Put your tongue out.  Put your tongue out.  Pick your tongue out.  Oh, God.  Is everyone else picturing what I'm picturing?  Yeah.  Shoving a big hog down there.  No, that's not what I'm picturing.  No, your breath's okay. 
[02:39:00]  Thank you.  Her breath is okay.  I'm curious if anyone has bad breath here.  No one's got bad breath.  No proteins in her diet.  It's stinky.  Okay.  Stinky.  Why am I lumped in with all these freaks?  Yeah.  No, don't take it personally, stinky.  Okay.  Well, stinky.  Yeah.  Well, the pot breath.  Let's see what happens here.  What about smoking pot or drinking?  Yeah.  Any kind of smoking will make your breath worse.  It makes your mouth get dry.  Alcohol really screws your breath up.  Wow.  That's why Listerine, if people use that a lot, actually makes your breath worse instead 
[02:39:30]  of better.  Goddamn that Listerine.  Yeah.  Okay.  Stinky.  You should take a bath in Listerine, though.  Okay.  All the way out.  There you go.  Ready?  Stinky.  Look at Stinky.  He doesn't know what the hell's going on.  Like, why am I doing this?  Kind of weird without a yam bag on the chin, isn't it, Garrett?  Young Garrett.  What is a yam bag?  What do we got there, Don?  Not bad.  About 19.  19?  I'll tell you, I tested somebody yesterday on Channel 2, and he had 250.  Wow.  So your guys are much better than Channel 2.  I only wish Tom from New Orleans was here to blow your machine up. 
[02:40:00]  Why?  He's very drunk.  Yeah, if you're drunk, yeah.  Yeah, he was very drunk.  Yeah, that's what it was.  Well, you know what gives you bad breath?  A lot of medications.  Antidepressants, high blood pressure medications.  Oh, yeah?  Ah!  Not me.  Don't look at me.  I should be, but I'm sorry.  I way got it.  May I recommend somebody that gets rid of bad breath?  Oh, okay, go ahead, Don.  It's the formula that I developed called TheraBreath. 
[02:40:30]  TheraBreath.  TheraBreath.  You even have my picture on it.  I would like to have that.  I will give it to you.  I'll hand it out.  If you guys want to give it out to people that have bad breath.  All right, we can do that.  Thank you so much.  Can I say something here from my heart, man?  Sandy, watch now.  I really have had bad breath all my life.  When I was 14 years old, I realized it.  It has ruined my sex life.  I never get too close.  I don't think that did it.  I never get too close to people.  Because nobody wants to touch you.  I know.  No, but it's also my breath.  You're like a Dustin Hoffman movie. 
[02:41:00]  No, you said national radio.  But, you know, it should.  I always had dreams about bringing it out into the open.  And it's really a very sad thing.  I wish you would die slowly and painful.  This is the worst thing I've ever heard.  Sandy, that isn't a sad thing.  You're a sad thing.  No, when I do a one-woman show, I never became an actress.  Because I had to deal with other actors.  Sandy, tell us the pain of having halitosis.  Bad breath, and it's horrible.  What's the pain of bad breath?  It's like you don't.  You're 14, and what happened?  Okay.  It's not only when you're 14.  You were coming over on the Conestoga wagons. 
[02:41:30]  When you really like a man.  When you really like a man, you can't get too close.  Because you're afraid to even offend him.  Oh.  So you don't even come on to him.  Because you were talking the other day about women coming on to men.  Oh, yeah.  Sex therapist.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And it's so hard when you have bad breath.  Because if you like a guy, you don't want to get too close.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  And you're just bad.  Right.  I always went with guys that I didn't really care for because I could care less of what  they cared about.  So your breath.  It was always your breath.  This man, if he really is doing a good thing, I'm going to try it. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, please try it.  Because what happens, people have bad breath.  Are we talking about bad breath on our show today?  Yeah.  Every hole you have is an atrocity.  No, I smell good down here.  Everything that opens is infected on you.  Do you know I smell very good?  No, you don't.  Don't stop it.  How do you know?  Because I know where I smell good.  There's a war to sign a Stonehenge down there.  It doesn't smell good.  It does, really.  It's disgusting.  I've got compliments.  Every hole is offended. 
[02:42:30]  I've got compliments about me down there.  From who?  All right.  From men.  From men.  Oh, you smell good.  Okay, why don't we...  The only time she was able to talk to the guys is after they did a little oral on it.  Because their breath was worse than yours, right?  Well, after they did it, maybe.  Yeah, of course.  I'm just saying, I haven't even smelled good here.  I have great armpits.  Dr. Josh, thank you.  And my mirror end is great.  Oh, you're very well.

There were more today than in four years of dental school.  I'm sure you did.  You're the heavy devil.  Huddle, huddle.  All right.  Let's get Sandy out of the studio.  Sandy, do you have a song?  Yeah, I do.  She got a song, Ophie.  Thank you very much.  All right.  But what about my TV show, which is on Wednesday and Thursday?  Ophie, what's wrong with you today?  It's Valentine's Day. 
[02:43:30]  Don't shake the microphone.  I have to fix those things.  You're killing me.  This is a professional operation.  Thanks for the therapy, though.  This is good.  Therapy breath.  Sandy.  Sandy.  Sandy.  I can't wait to try this.  Sandy.  And I'll spit it out on Ophie.  Yeah?  All right.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  He's coming back.  A little F&M here.  You know, Ophie's into S&M.  You know how I know?  Beats me.  Holy Jesus.  Beats me.  All right.  We're going to play Sandy Jean's song. 
[02:44:00]  The one she came up with.  I love Dick.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  We've played the I Love Dick song already.  You have?  Yeah.  Oh, you have?  Meaning Richard, your friend.  Yeah, your friend.  My ex.  Your ex, uh, Dick.  He left a bad taste in my mouth.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Oh, whatever.  Dick left a bad taste in my mouth.  All right.  We know.  We get the joke.  But I don't think I ever sang it, really. 
[02:44:30]  Thank you, Dr. Cass.  We're going to come back and play whatever we like.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks for having me.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Thank you, Doc.  And we'll do that next.  Keep it up, Doc.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  It's a squid.  It's a big squid, Joe.  It's a big squid.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on the Opie and Anthony show.  N-E-W.  What a day.  What a day. 
[02:45:00]  What a day.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Tomorrow, the qualifying begins.  Looking for girls to impress us.  Yep.  You want to join in the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Just give us a call.  Give us a call tomorrow and tell us what you would do to try to impress us so we could torture you.  Yeah.  For a really, really good prize.  The privilege to have us torture you.  We got Headstand Girl coming in tomorrow with the old discipline thing.  Jim Norton's tickets go on sale tomorrow, right, Jim? 
[02:45:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  And it's 18 and over.  I've gotten that taken care of.  Oh, good.  Oh.  Get the youngsters in there.  Yeah.  18 and under was my preference.  For your own selfish reasons.  Yeah.  It's noon everywhere except Boston and Cleveland was 10 and Boston is next ticket in bed.  All right.  Eatabull.com for ticket info on Jim Norton's tour dates.  Buzz said he learned that Dr. Katz's machine needs another digit because Sandy's breath was probably 1,023. 
[02:46:00]  Ivan, what's up?  That's good.  Ivan.  Hey, how are you?  What's up?  What's up, Ivan?  What's up, you crazy son of a bitch?  How are you, fella?  Hey, I've learned three things tonight.  Yeah.  First of all, how it poses and the radio equals not funny.  Yeah, I know.  Get that away from me.  I realized halfway through it that we were talking about bad breath.  I don't know, man.  Look at this picture.  I can't even hold the camera while it has that picture on the back of it. 
[02:46:30]  What else, Ivan?  Oh, my God.  Rick's got a picture of Twato dressed up like a little heart there.  It's painted red.  It's painted red.  Where are these pictures going to be, man?  Opiananthony.com?  All right.  You've got to see.  And don't think that she stuck something in the area.  That is a genital wart that she painted red.  I know.  I can't.  All right, Ivan. 
[02:47:00]  We're going to let you go, all right?  All right, man.  One more thing.  Yeah, go for it.  Tomorrow it's 620.  I'm going to go crazy.  Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.  Come on.  We're learning about other versions of that bit that we'll do tomorrow for you.  Oh, well, Friday tomorrow.  We've got to pull out the crazy bits.  Yes, Jimmy?  No, no, I'm just...  Oh, you're getting all ready.  You're getting psyched to be crazy.  Being a little wacky.  Paul, what's going on?  What's up, O&A?  Hey.  I learned that 3 to 7 is different in Sacramento than it is in New York. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, you thought that.  I'm glad you picked up on that one.  Ah, puta.  Ah.  Ah, boy.  Later, guys.  All right.  Did we really learn this?  Jose, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I learned that Aunt and Brother Joe never have to worry about Valentine's Day because Aunt  Sister sells hooker clothes and stuff.  She worked at a lot of those places.  Frederick's of Hollywood, Victoria's Secret.  All that.  She worked at, um...  Yeah, we'd always...  You know, she's like, ah, get your gag gift. 
[02:48:00]  And I'd open up this thing.  How many years for Christmas?  I got the...  Oh, it's the men's underwear with the big elephant trunk where the schlong goes.  Oh, funny gag gift from your sister.  With little ears.  Yeah, it's got the floppy ears.  Look, let me put my schlong in here.  Let me go show Mom.  That's only great if the trunk is on the inside so your mule looks really big.  John, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, good.  Hey, listen, you know, after all the...  What I learned today, after all the shows you've had where you've had hot girls on there 
[02:48:30]  and you're talking to them, Norton's getting some in the background.  Yeah.  And I want to go home and rub one out with my wife.  After all those days, it's a nice, the night that she's actually going to want to do it.  And after hearing that talk about Sandy came here and twatto, I want to go home and puke.  Well, what about we gave you Danielle a showering today?  Danielle in the shower.  I got on the radio late today.  Oh, my God.  She's usually at the end of the night, man.  John, let me tell you what you missed.  Contestant number 93 in the Naughty Naughty Contest called us from Sacramento. 
[02:49:00]  She listened to the show, and she took a shower for all of us today.  Oh, I missed all that.  I got it on late.  And she was cleaning everything.  Thanks, guys.  And, dude, incidentally, I've never sat in the back and gotten any.  I get none from these strippers.  None.  That's not what it sounds like sometimes.  I know.  That's the torture of being me.  They rub their hineys on me and leave.  All right, John.  Anyway, I want to go hear myself.  Go crazy.  Bang, bang.  Oh, no.  Bang, bang, bang.  Oh, we started. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, we've created a monster.  John, what's up?  How you doing?  Good.  I wanted to say what I learned.  I learned that cordless phones aren't waterproof in the shower.  That's true.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Oh, no, no.  Don't do this to us.  Enough of the bang, bang.  Don't do this to us.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys, I learned a couple of things.  Yeah.  I learned that you can't compete with a show that has no format.  Yeah.  And I learned that while go wash the Bromopad might draw blank stares, clean the snatch is  globally understood. 
[02:50:00]  Yes.  You heard that.  They didn't dump out of that?  No, I was surprised.  No, there you go.  I know, one quick question for you.  What, Grandpa Walton's not on the dump button today?  I don't know what happened, man.  Well, yeah, go ahead, Uncle John.  While you're spanking for Dan Yello tonight, are you going to have a NASCAR site on standby?  Well, it's Valentine's Day, so I've got to hang out with Sam.  And so tomorrow I'll be spanking it to Dan Yello.  Yes.  All right, later, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what did you learn today? 
[02:50:30]  I learned today that blowing the fuzz has nothing to do with the amount of Charmin lit on your  girlfriend's gash.  And that nothing is funny if it's outside your zip code.  And that every orifice on Sandy Kane is an atrocity.  Very good.  Hey, Mike, where are you calling from?  Allentown.  Allentown, PA.  All right.  You're right, dude.  She really is a three-hole disaster.  Awful.  Oh, that was really funny.  Thank you.  Later.  All right.  Anthony from West Orange.  He learned school closings are good for child molesters. 
[02:51:00]  Dip Spit Eric from Jersey.  I learned that he could fool the fuzz by calling in the radio.  I learned today Rick's package is bigger than Opie's.  Uh, no, mine was bigger than yours.
