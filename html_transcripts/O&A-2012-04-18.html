<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts' characteristically vulgar banter, boasting about their popularity and mocking their own voices.  They transitioned into a discussion about Opie's viewing of *The Raven*, focusing on its graphic violence and its impact on his family. This led to a complaint about receiving only one promotional copy, prompting a discussion on movie piracy and Opie’s doorman's generous (illegal) supply of pirated films.  The conversation then shifted to the upcoming interview with John Cusack, anticipating a potentially contentious exchange due to Cusack's perceived liberal views, especially on gun control, and his likely clash with Ted Nugent’s opinions.  They reviewed Cusack's filmography and a caller confirmed Cusack's anti-gun stance, setting the stage for a planned confrontational interview.  Chad Dukes called in, recounting a past negative experience with Cusack, further fueling the hosts' anticipation for a combative interview.  The segment concluded with discussions of their frustrations with their employer's policies, financial disputes with radio personalities over naming rights, and their upcoming live broadcast in Cleveland.

The next segment began with a dispute with their employers over expense reimbursements for out-of-town broadcasts.  The conversation then took a bizarre turn into a graphic discussion about body odor, specifically that of a sweaty man, and then menstrual blood, culminating in a plan to invite menstruating women to their Cleveland show.  They announced upcoming guests: John Cusack, Kevin Hart (promoting Steve Harvey's *Think Like a Man*), and Amy Schumer. Jim Norton recounted a near-fight in Times Square with a pedal cab driver.  The hosts then discussed Antonio Cromartie's numerous children, criticizing his apparent irresponsibility.  The segment concluded with clips of Ted Nugent making inflammatory political statements, leading to further discussion and debate.  Throughout this segment, the hosts frequently used vulgar language and interspersed comedic bits like "Cock Talk" and "Yenta Explorers."

The subsequent segment heavily featured Kevin Hart, promoting *Think Like a Man*.  Hart engaged in vulgar banter with the hosts about Steve Harvey and shared humorous anecdotes about his relationships with other comedians, including Keith Robinson, and celebrities like LeBron James and Shaquille O’Neal.  Jim Norton discussed his divorce, apartment, and his relationship with Hart.  The conversation then unexpectedly shifted back to Edgar Allan Poe in anticipation of the Cusack interview.  A caller (initially identified as Tom, later corrected to Todd) participated in a rapid-fire exchange about Poe's life and death.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Hart’s career and "FU Line" calls.

The next segment focused heavily on the delayed arrival of John Cusack, who was running late due to an appearance on the Howard Stern Show.  The hosts expressed frustration and jokingly threatened to cancel the interview, ultimately setting a 9:30 AM deadline.  They filled the time with discussions about Cusack's lateness, a humorous bit about a pilot's cockpit recording, and various tangents.  Once Cusack arrived, the interview commenced, covering *The Raven*, Poe's life, Cusack's acting experiences, his kickboxing training, and his opinions on boxing versus UFC.  The interview also touched upon Stephen King and different portrayals of Muhammad Ali. The interview, conducted in a casual and profane manner, lasted approximately 20 minutes.

Following the Cusack interview, the show delved into a discussion about whether the hosts were "pussies" for not adhering strictly to their time limit with Cusack.  Listener reactions to the interview and the hosts' actions were discussed, along with a lengthy segment on professional wrestling.  A significant debate ensued over who deserved credit for breaking Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe," with Sam Roberts and Troy Kwan arguing vehemently.  Other notable moments included a bet on whether Cusack would call Poe the "Godfather of Goth" (which he did), insults exchanged between the hosts and Chip,  a listener calling Cusack a "pussy," and the hosts' defense of their interview handling.  Chad Dukes and Troy Kwan were present (by phone and in studio, respectively) for much of this segment, and a caller claimed Opie uses scary movies to motivate his wife.  Multiple "What Did You Learn?" segments and listener calls were included.  A call from the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe (or a caller impersonating him) also occurred.

The final segment focused on the show's role in breaking Carly Rae Jepsen's song, crediting Troy with its discovery and advocacy.  A frustrated exchange between Opie and Troy ensued regarding Troy’s perceived lack of focus and difficulties working with a guest musician, "Club Soda Kenny."  Opie expressed annoyance with Troy's moodiness and multitasking.  The discussion touched upon a perceived slight from Mikey Piff.  The segment concluded with plans for a potential new weekly music segment featuring Troy, acknowledging potential challenges of introducing hip hop to their possibly racist listener base, and mentioning the upcoming Ron and Fez show.  No other guests besides "Club Soda Kenny" were explicitly mentioned as being in studio during this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Wake the fuck up!  What the fuck is going on?!  We're waking you up.  You ought to love it.  It's a privilege to hear our voices.  This is so cool.  It's fucking hysterically funny.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah!  One minute you're acting like an intelligent guy,  the next minute you're acting like a big giant ass.  He's got a giant of fire!  Oh my god!  Fucking brilliant, man.  Really funny shit.  Arousing in perverse and interesting ways.  It's like an audio rape. 
[00:00:30]  Yes.  It's amazing.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  There it is.  Morning.  Oh.  I think I'm good.  I think I'm good too.  I think I'm alright as far as the sound goes.  We've been lucky lately.  I'm a bit bassy.  Oh, you could count on that.  But I think it's my natural, my natural tone. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy, do you have a bass in your voice?  Probably.  Actually, I do have a little too much bass.  I like it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's sort of...  Maybe it's just morning throw.  Do you think so?  Yeah, it could be.  You don't have a humper.  You know, I think you're right.  Later on in the day, I don't have a bass in my voice.  By noon, everybody's talking like this.  Yeah, by noon, I'm a bit wimpy.  I got a wimpier tone.  Everyone sounds much cooler very early in the morning. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Boom.  Damn.  I could get things done with this voice.  Get some...  Take care of some business.  Damn, I could get some business taken care of.  Hey, I saw The Raven last night, which is John Cusack's new movie.  Ah.  And I'm always scared to see these movies before the guy comes in, because then you have to fake it if the movie sucks.  That's true, yeah.  And I'll be honest, you have to, because the guy's there.  Yeah.  But we do it in a way that I think the listeners can pick up on it, hopefully. 
[00:02:00]  I'm not going to fake it, man.  John Cusack's movie, The Raven, was really cool.  I didn't know it was about Edgar Allan Poe, though.  I didn't make that connection, The Raven and Edgar Allan Poe.  But, I mean, it could have been another...  What's wrong?  Ah, my fucking...  What's wrong?  My shortcut isn't working.  Oh, wait, it's working.  Oh.  Now it's working.  Oh.  Now it's working.  Who is it about?  No, don't do this to me.  Who is it about?  A writer. 
[00:02:30]  What's his name?  Some say one of the greatest writers.  Oh, very...  The writer of the macabre.  Yeah, I didn't realize he was macabre.  What's his name?  He's from Baltimore.  Is he?  Where the movie takes place in Baltimore.  He's probably from Baltimore, then.  Is he from Baltimore?  Did he spend some time in New York?  No.  He lived and died in Baltimore.  Who?  Then he's not...  Edgar.  Then he wasn't a great writer.  Edgar, no!  He wasn't a great writer, then, if he spent his whole life in Baltimore? 
[00:03:00]  That's not true.  There's lots of great things that come out of Baltimore.  Why wouldn't he move to New York at that point?  Babe Ruth is from Baltimore.  Did he move to New York?  After he was in Austin.  There you go.  To advance his career.  Okay.  But back then, how long would it have taken to go from Baltimore to New York, you think?  A month?  No, they had a train.  Did they have a train back when Edgar Allen...  Oh.  Edgar Allen, somebody was living?  Maybe.  Who was it?  The writer?  Edgar Allen.  Oh, Edgar.  Let me just get this out of the way. 
[00:03:30]  Edgar Allen...  Edgar Allen Poe.  Oosh.  Oosh.  Oosh.  Oosh.  Oosh.  I don't know, man.  I think we got too many new listeners.  They don't know what this is.  You know what?  The old listeners know.  The old guard is giggling their little balls off.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess Edgar Allen Poe wrote some dark shit, huh?  Yeah, apparently.  I think I tried to read some of his stuff growing up, and I just never really got into it.  I know he's a great writer. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, you know, I don't think he translates well with the children.  No.  It's a little long-winded for a kid, and the old-y time language kind of gets in the way  a little bit.  Well, my girl and my kid, they fleed the living room.  Oh.  Is that the word?  They fleed?  Fled.  Or fled?  Fleeted it, I'd say.  I like to say fleeted it.  They fleeted the living room.  It's fucking early, man.  Fleeted it.  Well, I know it. 
[00:04:30]  I know that.  I do know that word.  They fled the living room because, like you just said, it's a bit macabre and dark.  Macabre already.  And I've never seen more blood in a movie.  Your girl don't like the scary movies, I found out, right?  She don't like the scary movies.  Mentioned that in the past, that she really doesn't like scary movies.  And you showed her one movie once that she thought wasn't going to be scary, and it was.  Oh, The Shining.  The Shining.  How does she not know The Shining's not going to be completely rectified?  But I also told her that Fargo is a comedy. 
[00:05:00]  It kind of is.  But I really do believe Fargo's a comedy.  Yeah.  But the woodchipper scene was not much about comedy now, was it?  Oh, Jesus.  No, quickly, when we were dating, I decided to turn her on to some movies.  Yeah.  And one of the movies was The Shining.  Some of the classics.  And I was in a tiny little apartment, and the kitchen was right off the living room.  And she's not one to do the dishes.  And we were watching The Shining, and the opening scene with the fucking car going up  the mountain with the music and shit. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, that's creepy music.  Oh, fuck, is this the creepiest music ever?  Within 20 minutes, she didn't want to tell me yet that she is petrified of scary movies.  I mean, petrified.  She hates them.  She's trying to be a good egg.  Yeah, she's just trying to be cool because we're dating and stuff, and I'm excited about  showing her The Shining.  All of a sudden, she disappeared.  I'm like, where the fuck is she?  Because the lights were down.  It was dark.  She's in the fucking kitchen, keeping herself busy.  Oh, man.  She didn't want to.  Making believe she had to do something in there.  But she was in there a long time. 
[00:06:00]  Did you turn the movie off?  That's pretty funny.  I don't remember.  It's so many years ago.  I would pause it and go, waiting for you.  Yeah.  Yeah, no kidding.  You're sitting there with an erection as the blood is pouring out of the elevator.  She's like, what's wrong with this guy?  There's no reason she should be with me, because then there was another time where we're eating.  You can just stop before the because.  I don't know.  We're eating burritos, and she decided to fluff her little blanket she had on, and a  mouse goes flying.  Oh, shit.  Another time, she's eating food, and a mouse is literally on two legs, looking up at her, 
[00:06:30]  wanting a little taste.  The mouse is in your bed?  No, remember?  No, that was on the couch.  That was the apartment, right?  The apartment that had, well, I had over 60 confirmed kills before I moved out.  60 kills for the opster.  60 confirmed kills.  Anyway, she's like, I like Edgar Allan Poe.  I read some of that shit growing up.  I'm like, all right, cool.  Let's check this movie out.  Man, she took that kid and fled.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  It is a dark movie.  It's a murder mystery.  Yeah.  It's serial killer-ish.  His books weren't necessarily, like, gory or anything.  They were very suspenseful and such, but not really gory.  So, if you're used to reading the books, and you're like, oh, that's cool, and you go  to see the movie, you're probably going to be like, oh, geez, a little blood.  When you think Edgar Allan Poe, you think Pit and the Pendulum, right?  The Pit and the Pendulum.  Well, guess what?  They said to themselves, if we're going to make a Pit and the Pendulum scene, we're going 
[00:07:30]  to go all the fuck in.  We're not fucking around here.  So, you can only imagine.  I'm not giving anything away.  I mean, it's pretty obvious they're going to do something with the Pit and the Pendulum,  right?  I assume it gets used.  Yeah.  I don't think there's that much blood in the human body.  Let's just put it that way.  Oh, my God.  Gets a little graphic.  But, quickly, John Cusack coming in at 9 o'clock, and his new movie, The Raven.  I liked it.  And did they do anything with the Telltale Heart?  Telltale Heart.  Oh, yeah, they do. 
[00:08:00]  One of his stories.  Oh, yeah, they do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want me to give away shit?  What do you want me to do here?  No, I still want to see it.  Oh, yeah, there's a heart scene.  Oh, yeah, there is.  What?  Do you know other books and stuff?  A couple of Edgar Allan Poe stories when I was a kid.  I remember.  Give me another one.  School or something.  There's the other one.  Oh, well, fuck.  Nevermore.  The Raven.  Yeah, The Raven.  The Raven.  Nevermore.  It's about somebody who loves something and can't stop talking about it. 
[00:08:30]  He's not raving about it.  The Raven.  Oh, God.  Chipper.  Did I really attempt to say fleeted?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Could we have a read it?  No, you said fleed.  Which ain't bad.  And then I went with fleeted.  Or fleeteded.  I do know it's flood.  I really do.  Fled.  I like saying flood.  Flood.  I flood the scene.  Right.  But, I mean, we only had one copy of this movie, so I fucked up the whole show because I kept 
[00:09:00]  the one copy.  And then Jimmy's texting me.  He wants the copy.  Yeah.  And then I was out and about.  And then when I finally was ready to hand over the copy.  The copy.  And I don't know why.  Jimmy's right.  Jimmy got a little mad yesterday during a break with Roland.  And you're absolutely right.  Yeah.  We should bring it up.  If these guys want us to see their movies, you've got to give us more than one copy.  Yes.  There should be three copies.  What are they paranoid about?  I'll tell you this.  I thought we produced the movie.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Because now they put our names on the screen.  Yeah.  And it was across the middle of the screen, so I'm like, man, I think we might have produced  this movie.  It looks good.  Seeing our name up there in the credits.  In the middle of the movie.  Right.  But for the entire movie, it says Opie and Anthony, so we're not going to get away with  anything.  So why wouldn't you just give us a few copies?  It's really irritating.  It's probably the movie company.  Right.  But it's like, well, you guys want to promote your fucking movie.  You got your guy out doing radio.  You obviously want to promote this movie.  The fucked up thing with the movies are, if it gets out, it's everywhere. 
[00:10:00]  Like, it's fucked up.  Now, it used to be, if a movie got out and it was bootlegged, you know, you had to pretty  much find it on the street in a VHS.  Right.  Someone selling it at the tables somewhere.  And that was the only way to really distribute it.  And it never really got wide black market distribution.  Now, the second it gets online, it just reproduces exponentially.  And it's fucking everywhere.  Like a true virus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And anyone can do it. 
[00:10:30]  It's funny you should say that, because I got a doorman.  Man, let's say it's the Raven, because that's coming out soon, what, in about a week?  All I see, Jimmy knows the guy, too, because you see him as well.  I see him for literally five seconds.  I get out of getting his car, and he runs to the car.  I don't need that service, but he does.  And then we walk to the building together, right?  Within that five seconds, he's like, hey, man, I got the Raven.  You need the Raven?  I'm just using the Raven as an example.  He always has the movies that are coming out or just came out. 
[00:11:00]  And he goes, it's not a bad copy, either.  There's a little talking.  You know, there's one head, but you don't notice it after a while.  Oh, God.  I wonder, doorman's not allowed to enjoy a movie, too?  What's the matter?  Doorman can't just have a good time, I guess, right?  Seinfeld.  Doorman.  But he's got some kind of side business where, you know, there's some bootlegging going on.  Wow.  Yeah.  Damn.  And he's proud of the copies he gets.  Yeah, this one's not bad.  There's a little chatter in the beginning as people settle down, but after that, you don't  even notice.  That's another Seinfeld episode where you don't bootleg the movie. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, here's the other.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I got knocked down so bad with Jimmy with the bootleg movies, though, when I fucking showed  him Star Trek.  That was the end of my bootlegging movies to show other people.  What was wrong with that copy?  It was, it cut off the sides of the top and the bottom of the movie.  Terrible.  It was terrible.  It was awful.  And it was jittery when they panned.  Hey, oh, where's the Enterprise going? 
[00:12:00]  Fire faces.  Yeah, we've all tried the bootleg movie, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  So frustrating.  Like, God, why did I just go to a theater?  I know, I ruined it.  Now I know the story, but I didn't see the fucking movie.  I didn't see it properly.  I'm a piece of shit.  But they got a new thing, too.  You got to put a code in.  Where?  I don't know.  Like, a fucking pet, a number pet thing comes up, and then you got to put the code in they  gave you.  Are you shitting me?  So that number they're giving just to me. 
[00:12:30]  So they know that, uh...  Wow, that's fucked up.  So I guess if you do get this bootleg copy, which goes back to Jimmy's point, why not give  us three fucking copies with the number code?  So I guess if you got...  Here it is, right here.  If you got this, and you pop it in at home, you got to guess what code will start the movie.  Well, that could take a while.  But I'm sure there's guys out there that have...  Cracked.  ...have the workaround for that as well.  Cracks.  I mean, Roland got mad at me, because I just said they should give us three copies. 
[00:13:00]  I got mad at you.  And he's like, that's all they have is one, or whatever.  And I'm like, no, that's not all they have is one.  He's like, well, actually, they told me, like, yeah, I'm kind of pissy about it.  I was like, but I'm not attacking you.  Well, they only give us so many copies, you can tell them to give me.  Like, I know Roland would give the copies up.  I wasn't implying that he was keeping them.  Roland takes it very personally.  But that fucking movie company...  It has nothing to do with Roland.  Yeah.  The movie company should do the right thing and give us copies, because now only one guy knows  the movie.  Yeah, I'd love to find out who made that decision.  I'd love to tell John Cusack, your movie is not going to get... 
[00:13:30]  It'll get promoted well.  Oh, boy.  But it won't get as good a promotion, because you can't have three guys talking about it.  It's a dumb, dumb thing to come about.  I might have had the disc since April.  Let me see the date on this.  Oh, no.  See, that might be it.  April 9th.  But besides that...  But it's still...  What day is today?  It's the 18th.  Yeah.  I had this for nine days.  It's excusable.  But we shouldn't have to do that.  It should still provide three copies. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Look, I'm a busy man.  I'm trying to raise a son.  A busy man.  Maybe you should have gave it to Jimmy first.  But that's okay.  I think the movie's going to do really well.  I saw in the paper that he's going to be at the Apple Store in Soho to discuss the movie.  That's kind of cool.  Really?  The Apple Store is starting to do shit like that?  Well, I mean, we were saying yesterday with Vinny's book from the Jersey Shore.  These guys have nowhere to go to promote their shit.  So I even say yesterday.  I bet you they start popping up in other places like coffee shops. 
[00:14:30]  And here you go.  John Cusack at the Apple Store.  That's kind of cool.  When is he there?  I don't know.  I only read like, you know, a sentence of every story.  Skim.  Like to skim.  I'm a skimmer.  When?  Huh?  Today at five.  Oh, it is today.  Today at five.  Oh, so he'll be promoting that on our show.  What kind of rap does Cusack have as far as talk shows go?  I've heard things.  I've heard things.  Well, you know what?  Now, let me tell you something.  You know what?  I ain't putting up with any shit.  I'll tell you right now.  But we've been pleasantly surprised at other people that we thought may have been, you know, 
[00:15:00]  eh.  And then everybody that comes here ends up pretty cool except for that cunt Paris Hilton.  Yeah, I watched some interviews.  He was cool.  Yeah.  He's good at answering the question.  He can get political.  I know.  Oh, and he is extremely left-leaning.  Oh, good.  Extremely.  He must love it.  Extremely.  And he must love what Ted Dugent said.  What did Uncle Ted say?  I know.  I heard Uncle Ted say.  Look, I don't want any shit from this guy.  I'm telling you right now.  I leave my attitude at that door.  He better do the same.  He's an Obama guy. 
[00:15:30]  He actually, like.  He can't be an Obama guy if he's extreme.  He's probably disappointed in Obama.  He's probably, yeah.  Obama's not going too far enough.  That's the last thing he said.  He said he was extremely disappointed that Obama had not done a better job.  He did a better job of something like, you know, I'm paraphrasing, but righting the wrongs of the Bush administration.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Paraphrasing.  I do not want politics to be brought up.  Come on, man.  Let's do this.  Oh, God.  Let's do this.  He's here to promote his movie.  You have a strong point.  He has a strong point.  Let's do this.  I'm tired of arguing my dumb ass point. 
[00:16:00]  People are going to see The Raven.  Who cares?  Let's do this today.  Let's do this.  And he's a kickboxer.  Yeah?  I read that in the prep field.  No way.  20 years.  Shut up.  Right or wrong?  That's what I said.  I read it.  So why can't he be a kickboxer for 20 years?  Yeah, exactly.  What's wrong with that?  I don't know.  I just go think of him as that little kid in 16th Kansas.  I should have brought a movie in for him to sign or something, but I didn't.  Yeah, he really should have.  He's really famous.  I know.  He's been in a lot of movies. 
[00:16:30]  Con Air.  He was in Con Air, remember?  You don't think about him because he wasn't on the plane.  I love the one with the Stephen King movie he did.  That was a fucking scary film, man.  I liked that one.  I liked that one.  Room 1401 or whatever.  That's scary.  Was that good?  Yeah, it scared me.  I liked that movie.  People say, oh, 1408.  Whatever.  A couple of doors down.  Yeah.  People were like, that movie sucked.  I liked it.  It was pretty fucking creepy.  It scared me.  Samuel L. Jackson at the beginning was really funny.  There were some very frightening moments.  Very scary.  I don't like those weird ghostly looking people looking at them all weird and then jumping 
[00:17:00]  out the fucking window.  Really?  Oh, it was scary.  It did have a shining kind of a thing going with it a little bit.  You know, the hotel fucking haunted.  Ooh, scary.  He was in High Fidelity.  Oh, yeah.  It was his movie.  I liked that movie.  It was his movie, man.  It's Tim.  I forgot he was in that.  He's the guy.  Better off Ted.  He's great.  Yeah, but it could have been any guy.  Just like the movie.  Two dollars.  What else was he in?  Hot tub time machine.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Give me that, Sam.  Say anything.  Let's do a little bit of peeking around. 
[00:17:30]  We know to say anything.  You've got an identity.  Did you see identity?  No.  If you're a child of the 80s, like we are, you know John Cusack movies.  Children of the 80s, Sam.  Incorrect.  You know the Cusack movies.  Yeah, of course you do.  Being such a child of said 80s.  You know them because you remember them like they were yesterday.  He's in that Pacino movie.  Which one?  My chipped.  My fat.  Where he played the, Pacino played the mayor, I think.  I don't remember the name of it.  Oh.  He was in that.  Let me see.  Yes. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, he was in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  That was 97.  I can't believe that was so many years ago.  Wow.  Con Air.  He's been in a lot of fucking movies.  City Hall was called.  Ah, City Hall.  Can I take a phone call?  We're learning more about him.  And I'm telling you, we're going to do this today.  Oh, no.  Let's do this.  Eric in Colorado.  Oh, no.  Tell Anthony what you know.  Oh, shit.  Go ahead, Eric.  Hold on, Eric.  Start over.  Start over.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Cusack, hardcore anti-guess.  Oh, fuck.  We're going to do this today.  Really?  Anti-Second Amendment? 
[00:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  To the Constitution?  Look at that.  Now, you just sat up a little straighter in your chair.  I did.  You're ready to do this.  You're ready to do this today.  I just wanted to promote this movie.  Most people are very liberal.  Most people are very liberal against.  Yes.  Yes.  Come on.  Let's bring up guns.  Let's bring up Obama.  Oh, God.  The tax thing.  Oh, God.  The Ted Nugent thing.  You've got to say you completely agree with what Ted said yesterday.  This is going to be good.  I'm wearing a hat from my range that I go to.  Oh, no.  It's got a target, like a crosshair on the front. 
[00:19:00]  You ready to do this today?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Come on.  Let's do this.  What time is he getting in?  You want to get loose?  What time is he getting here?  Nine o'clock.  All right.  Do some stretches.  Hey, John.  So, politically, you're just a tad left-leaning.  Yes, but I'm here for my movie.  This isn't a political discussion, you idiot.  So, let's get back to the Raven.  No, we've got to mix the politics in as we talk about the movie.  Ah, okay. 
[00:19:30]  So, the Raven.  Ask him if Edgar Allan Poe would have voted for a guy like Obama.  That could start it.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Do you want to do this today?  Ravens are black.  Oh.  So is the president.  Now, John, we are in such a violent movie.  This is a very violent, bloody movie.  Isn't that a tad hypocritical of you, being so anti-gun? 
[00:20:00]  What's the difference?  Well, nobody ever threw a movie of somebody and killed them.  Some guy in Cleveland didn't just kill his wife and kids by throwing a movie at them.  You know?  John, shut up.  Why don't I just be in John?  I like being John.  It's fun.  Better than being Jim.  Anything but Jim.  Is this him ripping Obama's imperial presidency?  Wow.  See?  I told you he wouldn't be an Obama guy.  Let's listen to him a little bit.  I want a little taste here of the Cusack.  Critical race this year? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what are you thinking?  I don't know.  How are you feeling?  I sort of feel like there's some kind of Rubicon line issues that are addressed.  I don't have to do with you.  It's like Comic-Con, but for Rubik's Cubes.  Some of the issues that the Obama administration has with due process and with the assassination of American citizens, this speech by Eric Holder, I think, are deeply troubling.  Oh, you mean the terrorists?  Beyond left and right.  But from a civil libertarian point of view, the excesses of the Bush administration, I think he had a constitutional obligation to correct that. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, he's a civil libertarian.  He should be for the Second Amendment.  But this is so weird.  When you hear a guy say, why do I get a little annoyed when I hear that?  It's like we take politics so personally.  It's like that's just his view.  He's not – but it's weird when you hear that, you immediately –  You get angry.  Yeah, but what about –  I know.  You get very angry.  But why do I want to do that?  You're right.  Like he's not – he's just saying what he thinks. 
[00:21:30]  Like who gives a fuck?  His point of view.  Yeah.  But it's immediate that I get that reaction.  Like what about Awalaki?  He was a fucking terrorist.  Fuck him.  But so what?  An American citizen.  When you're treasonous against your country –  Yeah, but yeah, of course.  But fuck that guy.  I'm glad they killed him.  Some would say that he would probably should have been arrested and had due process.  And, you know, it's an American citizen.  Others would say he's treasonous against his country during – it is a time of war regardless of, you know, whether Congress has to approve it or not. 
[00:22:00]  It seems to be a little thing of the past.  But yeah, there is – it is a touchy situation, that whole thing.  Even I think, like, you know, I'm all for it.  Guy blows fucking dumb ass up.  But then you do start thinking, like, ah, is it right?  Is it – as far as the Constitution goes, is it right?  You know?  I don't know where I stand on that whole thing, to tell you the truth.  Personally, yeah, do it up.  But as a civil libertarian – 
[00:22:30]  Maybe the Cougs will win you over.  I think me and Cusack – I think we got a lot in common politically.  Oh, good.  More so than you might think.  That's what I'm saying.  Well, that's why we have to get into it.  But yeah, definitely.  Yeah, we're doing this today.  I find them to be –  Don't change your dial.  I find them to be irritating because I don't think – and again, I mean, real ones are fine.  But I find that a lot of the ones today, they think they're fighting a civil liberties battle by complaining about airport security.  And it drives me fucking nuts. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, right.  And it's like, where are you defending all these guys?  Even though it's not a government thing, where are you defending these guys who are saying – they're not sticking up for them.  They're just – they're targeting the airport.  They've got to go through the earth.  Right.  Let me ask you a question about John Cusack.  Oh.  So he's very anti-gun, right?  I don't know.  I've heard that from one caller.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  We just – oh, yeah. 
[00:23:30]  We really do zip it right around and –  Point to Eric in Colorado.  Yeah.  Let's say he is, though, right?  Uh-huh.  In this Raven movie, he's got a gun.  He's shooting a little bit.  Oh, there you go.  And what movie was he in?  Gross Point Blank?  Yes.  Yes.  There's a lot of guns in that movie.  A lot of gunplay in that, but it's a character.  Well, that's what I want to ask you.  How do you feel about that?  Because if you're anti-gun and you're shooting guns in movies, isn't that influential in a way?  I don't know.  I think it –  Is it hypocritical or is it not?  I think it's showing, like, you put the gun in the movie to increase the action and – 
[00:24:00]  Right.  So you're using the fact that guns are out there.  Right.  In a movie to kind of bring people in.  But some of these actors or actresses have power.  I mean, the famous one is Drew Barrymore.  Yes, on Charlie's Angels.  Completely – well, besides Charlie's Angels, completely against guns.  And so when they remade E.T., she was able to fucking get the guns out of all the feds' hands.  They removed her tits in that movie, too. 
[00:24:30]  Do you notice?  Oh, really?  Yeah, they digitally took out her tits because she didn't have any –  No, she was five.  She was five, Ann.  She was five.  Oh, see?  I really thought Spielberg went much too far.  No, no.  She was younger.  With his editing.  Wow, we had good chemistry right there.  Oh, that's great.  Fuck, that was like 98.  All over again.  98.  Oh, my God.  And you're right.  Then Charlie's Angels, which she just fucked that franchise.  They should have been on their 10th fucking Charlie's Angels movie by now.  Exactly, no one cared.  But they tried to make that without guns, right? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And it was all karate shit instead.  Yeah, yeah, very anti-gun.  She's very anti-gun.  But she decided, look, I hate guns, so I got an influence here.  I'm going to make sure that I use my influence to keep guns out of movies.  Yeah.  It failed miserably for her, I think.  I suppose people that are anti-gun have never fired one, and really –  Oh, God.  I am building this up. 
[00:25:30]  This is like a wrestling story right now.  Is it?  Is it?  We like the Big O and Dukes, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Very much.  This guy, Matt Bishop, who I think is very reliable.  Bishop?  I know the Matt Bishop.  He writes on the Instant Feedback that Big O and Dukes considered him – do you want  me to read this?  Please.  You sure?  Yeah.  Well, I'll whisper in case he's listening.  They considered him the biggest asshole they ever interviewed.  Wow.  To the point Chad Duke walked out on his own show. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, no.  What happened?  Well, maybe they were dicks.  Are they doing their show right now?  They're in one of those 25-minute commercial breaks, so have them call the show.  I want to find out.  I don't know if they do.  They might be afternoons.  Oh, the afternoons?  I want to say the 3-7 in D.C.  No, no, no.  They're not.  Yeah, Big O and Dukes are not on the air.  They're doing podcasting because JFK took them off.  Why?  They went sports.  Jesus Christ.  They do a good show.  What is wrong with the radio industry? 
[00:26:30]  It stinks.  Now we need five fucking sports talk stations at one time.  Well, because one worked, and then everybody goes, ah, please pile on the idea.  Idiots.  Well, John Cusack apparently stated that he supports gun control and supports suing gun manufacturers  when he did the movie Runaway Jury.  That's what a website said.  Yeah.  All right.  So, again, we don't really have any confirmation.  It's a message board website.  Blurdy, blurdy, blur.  We just throw bullshit out there.  We obviously got to ask him. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the only way to find it.  If he's going to be here, you might as well just ask him.  I want to ask him about Shameless because his sister's in Shameless.  You watch Shameless?  No.  That show is the fucking shit, man.  And Joan Cusack is twisted.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She is twisted.  She's playing a great character for Shameless.  Oh, I've seen a few episodes.  You like Shameless?  That's the one with William H. Macy, right?  Yeah, who was in and we had a good time with her.  I'm kind of bummed he didn't come back to promote the current season.  He's a busy man, I'm sure. 
[00:27:30]  But.  Yeah, I have seen that.  You saw the dildo scene.  Joan Cusack's dildo scene.  No, I did not see that one.  She likes the dildos.  No.  Yeah, she's into the dildos.  Her character is.  I will say that on the prep sheet, it says Kevin Hart got divorced off the subject.  His wife asked for $90,000 a month.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Set up balls.  How do they justify that?  All I'm thinking of is, wow, he's doing good.  Wow, right? 
[00:28:00]  That makes you a little happy, doesn't it?  I don't want to see her.  You guys are twisted.  You don't like when your friends do well.  No, it's amazing to someone to guess that she's asking for half.  So $90,000 a month would give you a million a year, right?  Oh, yes, $900.  That's right, a little million.  $900 and then another, what, $18,000 in there.  So you're talking a million eight.  Yeah.  But that's not necessarily just getting half of his shit.  That's above and beyond.  Oh, yeah.  Because women get like this fucking, it's not even alimony anymore. 
[00:28:30]  It's support or whatever the fuck it is.  And then above and beyond that, there's the material marital property, which gets divvied up.  Right.  For some reason, you've got to take half the shit.  And then he's got to continue paying with the shit he gets to keep.  It doesn't make any sense.  And then you're officially never really divorced.  Oh.  Because you continue to, you know, have to pay.  Yeah.  Ah, we've done that break a million times.  I mean, I'm all for, you know, the women making out fairly. 
[00:29:00]  Fair is one thing.  Fairly.  Wow.  But raping the guy, Jesus.  That's just gone crazy.  I mean, the Hulk Hogan one is the best one ever.  Yeah.  Where Linda never fucking took a bump in the ring.  And she's got his house.  Yeah.  His amazing house that he was able to either build.  He might have built it from scratch.  I don't know.  And then he has to drive by.  Drive by in the boat.  As his little dog is there.  And cry.  I mean, we laugh.  But we can relate.  You know, we can understand why the guy's crying.  What you going to do? 
[00:29:30]  All right.  All right.  We've got the Chad Dukes on the line.  Hey, Chad.  Boys, how are you?  Good morning.  How do we hear your podcast for the people out there?  Oh, well, this is phenomenal.  BigOandDukes.com.  Actually, we were one of the shows to try to send you guys a demo for the golden ticket.  We sent our intern up there just to sit in the vestibule.  And he was told by Steve the Bear that you guys, unfortunately, weren't doing that promotion  any longer.  But, yeah, BigOandDukes.com.  Anybody that listens to O&A that wants to check it out?  Well, I'll tell you this before we get to why we asked you to call. 
[00:30:00]  We are playing, you know, segments from all our friends out there.  So you should send in some segments that we can run on the weekend.  Speaking of segments, you guys are just talking about Hulk Hogan.  I just was listening to the segment of E-Rock's list of heroes where I believe Anthony wipes  his asshole after you guys printed out the list off my face of the heroes.  And Hulk Hogan was buried at the top of that list, from what I recall.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock loves the Hulk Hogan. 
[00:30:30]  But then E-Rock got all choked up talking about that, the Hulkster.  I made sure I was removed from his list.  Yeah, you got yourself removed.  You did everything in your head.  I don't like all that attention.  It's awkward.  Well, you were number one, I believe.  I believe you were above your old dad.  God, E-Rock, what were you thinking back then?  Like, regardless, even if you do and respect him and everything, like, that's fine, but  you don't write it down.  How uncomfortable does that make everyone? 
[00:31:00]  That's why I had to destroy him.  I had to destroy it.  It was just too uncomfortable.  It really was.  You're his hero.  Nothing wrong with that.  You're with a boy working with his hero.  E-Rock, where was I for real?  Second?  Behind your dad?  Yeah, you were, uh, yeah, you were number two.  No, you, wait, you might have been three.  No, he was number two.  He was probably two.  I think he was two.  Yeah, it was Dad, Hulk Hogan, and Opie.  Dad, Hulk Hogan, and Opie.  Oh, you adult.  Just kind of a drop off there, isn't there? 
[00:31:30]  Not in his mind.  But yeah, eight years later, it's still, uh.  All right, it still stings.  We get along.  We're good.  We're good now, right?  You're off my cell phone, too, so it's all right.  He was just saying that.  He just texted me yesterday.  Shut up.  Hey, are you reading this?  Yeah, exactly.  You want me to read the text?  Watching the news?  Yeah, watching the news?  No, I'm not.  What?  Hey, Chad.  Yeah.  Let's get down to brass tacks.  We're going to interview John Cusack today for the new movie, The Raven, which I saw last 
[00:32:00]  night and I liked.  I do want to say that much.  Now, we're doing a little reconnaissance here.  Yeah.  So, what do we, someone, oh, you probably don't even know why we're calling.  Someone basically wrote that you walked off your own show and you consider him the biggest  asshole you've ever interviewed.  Oh, that's what we wanted to ask you about.  Yeah.  He, well, Oscar, the guy I do the show with, is like a huge John Cusack mark.  Like, I enjoyed Con Air. 
[00:32:30]  You know, like, I can appreciate John Cusack, but is it Can't Hardly Wait, where he's holding  the, what's the movie where he's holding the boombox over it?  Say anything.  Say anything.  Yeah.  Thank you.  So, Oscar thinks this movie is like fucking Godfather.  Like, the way you guys talk about radio.  He loves it.  So, at the end of the interview, like, we put up with this guy's bullshit.  He talks about whatever shitty movie he's made for like eight minutes straight.  And then Oscar makes one reference towards that movie, trying to tell John Cusack how 
[00:33:00]  much he liked it.  And the guy could not have been more revolted.  He could not have been a bigger dick about it.  And so, I mean, I said, you know, man, it's, I know, I understand you're a big movie star.  I understand.  You probably get tired of being asked about this flick.  But Jesus Christ, Cooter from the Dukes of Hazzard drives around in the General Eats.  So, people will just know who he is.  I mean, for God's sake, take your fame, you know, a little less seriously.  Wow.  Oh, man.  So, if we bring up, like, other movies, he's not going to be very happy about it? 
[00:33:30]  Is that what?  I don't, I mean, this was four or five years ago when we were actually relevant.  So, I'm not sure.  I'll never understand that.  You know, you're in a huge movie.  I would, A, would love to be in a huge movie.  And, B, I would love to be asked about it for the rest of my life.  What's wrong with that?  I don't get that.  You were in a huge video movie when you were asking those two gay kids when Lady Gaga was  coming out of the front of XM when you were screaming, don't you know who I am?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  Well, people kind of enjoy that video for some reason.  They really do enjoy that.  Like, I'm a fucking asshole.  Do you remember the traveling virus in Washington, D.C.?  You guys came down.  You were nice enough to come over.  Everybody's over there.  And I was trying to make a reference to role-playing games online.  So, I was trying to make a reference to World of Warcraft.  But I said, wow, during our live broadcast, you guys thought that I meant bumper stickers.  And it bombed so bad. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, no.  Our own radio show during the live broadcast.  Sorry about that.  Hey, are you making money off the podcast?  A little bit.  I had to pay money in taxes this year for the first time.  So, that was nice.  All right.  Yeah, that world's coming together.  So, hang in there.  One of the elite.  I was trying to make a Cats and Hats reference.  I was trying to make an Everglades reference.  I said, wow.  And Anthony looked at me like I was the biggest piece of shit in the world. 
[00:35:00]  And I wanted to hang myself.  Ah, that'll happen.  Well, now you get to explain what happened that day.  Yeah, see?  It's always better and funnier when you explain it.  Hey, you guys do that rap.  Oh, God.  If it wasn't you, it's going to be awkward.  Okay.  Do you do the rap about superheroes without their masks on?  Yeah.  God, is that a funny fucking bit.  I heard that online, man.  I wish it was a bit.  It's so nice of you.  But, yeah, if you look at the Avengers poster, it's Captain America and Iron Man and Thor and all these guys.  They're not wearing a goddamn mask. 
[00:35:30]  It's not like they have an identity protect at all.  It's just so stupid.  Like, wouldn't all the supervillains go and then just cut their hearts out?  As soon as they know who their real names and faces were?  Yeah, hence the disguise.  But then they go through all these movies where all of a sudden the superhero decides he has to have his mask off.  It's really stupid.  And it's way funnier probably when you listen to it than just...  Oh, no.  It's honestly a 10, 15-minute bit.  But it was pretty clever and it made me laugh pretty hard.  They probably just want girls to see him. 
[00:36:00]  That's Chip, Chad.  I'm aware of who Chip is.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  I just need my L having Chip talk to me on the phone.  All right.  So what do you think with John Cusack?  We'll do all right?  I think he's a dickhead.  I think you guys will do it as well.  I think you boys will be just fine talking.  Absolutely.  I don't know if Anthony will be shooting guns with him after the show.  No, huh?  I hear...  Yeah.  Now I hear he's not a big gun guy, but he's a libertarian, he says.  But...  How about we bring up just guns? 
[00:36:30]  Well...  Let's go with the gun thing.  I think we just let him babble about his movie for eight minutes straight.  And get him out of here.  And then talk to him about other movies that he was in so he could get mad.  And that'll be his cutie.  That sounds so...  Un-fucking-comfortable.  Yeah, man.  Why wouldn't you want to talk about Say Anything?  I know.  For...  I mean, I'm sure you guys promoted whatever movie he was in for.  And then you get a little taste of the Say Anything year.  Yeah.  When we talk about... 
[00:37:00]  When we were actually on radio that came out of people's speakers on our little podcast,  we'd never get angry about that.  I mean, that's about as relevant as our show was ever going to be.  And just if anyone wants to talk about it...  I just know when you guys talk about it on your radio show,  when people come up and they want to talk about you locking women into 50-gallon drums,  it's not like you get pissed off when people want to do that.  They'll bring that shit up.  Yeah.  Right?  Exactly.  We remember the good old days when we used to do stuff.  Yeah.  We can't do stuff anymore.  Yeah, maybe that's why we're mad.  Yeah.  We got Cleveland. 
[00:37:30]  That's right.  We got Cleveland coming up, people.  We got Cleveland.  Holy mack.  A week from Friday, we'll be broadcasting live.  Afternoons, though.  Or one afternoon.  Afternoon.  I know.  One afternoon, we're broadcasting live.  A week from Friday.  And the guys will be here for all of Friday.  They get to stay all of Friday.  Our staff gets to stay...  It's Saturday morning.  Gets to stay all of Friday.  Oh, Jesus.  Just thank you, buddy.  The amount of money this company just throws around.  They literally saved $300 million the other day. 
[00:38:00]  You would think maybe they could fucking get these guys a hotel room for Saturday night  so they could see Jimmy perform.  That's the whole reason we're going up there.  Chad, our whole staff has to leave after our live broadcast.  They're not allowed to stay for the reason why we're going up there.  I was beyond that.  And Opie and Anthony were supposed to go home, but they were embarrassed into paying for a  room for an extra night for opening.  Oh, I wouldn't have done it.  I would have told them to fuck themselves if they had tried that shit on me.  Shit crazy. 
[00:38:30]  I can't wait to podcast, Chad.  I'm going to be right there with you, buddy.  You boys are unbelievable.  It's funny.  We were broadcasting live from WrestleMania, and I went over to the set of Busted Open,  which I believe is the Sirius XM wrestling show they sent.  And they said, yeah, they sent us instead of Sam and E-Rock.  And I said, oh, that's very interesting, boys.  Instead of...  Instead of...  What did they send?  Meanwhile, E-Rock's there, fucking not seeing anything, having to crane his neck to look  at the big screen. 
[00:39:00]  He had to turn completely around.  He had to turn around.  He fucking...  No one else could eat because he had to run through the concession stands first.  Plus, he had to spend half his pocket money to get there.  His pocket money, yes.  He spent a lot of pocket money.  He's got it.  Thank God he has big pockets.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Does E-Rock buy, like, you think he buys, like, programs and stuff when he's...  Definitely, definitely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's wearing a WrestleMania sweatshirt today.  He buys tons of stuff.  He's got it, though.  Sam, you're a wrestling aficionado, right?  Yeah.  Who has bigger jeans, Haystack, Calhoun, or E-Rock? 
[00:39:30]  Oh.  I mean...  It's close, though, right?  It's really close.  I don't think that's what you meant by pockets.  Wow.  Wow.  I mean, I would say probably E-Rock because he wears him a little baggy.  You ever see Haystack, Calhoun?  Oh, yeah.  They're very tight.  All right.  Hey, Chad, good luck to you guys.  It's a shame.  You're one of the, you know, you're one of those shows that just got fucked in this new  world of radio, so...  A lot of guys deserve to be off the radio, let's be honest with each other. 
[00:40:00]  I don't like when anyone loses their radio job for bullshit reasons, but then you got  shows like, you know, Chad's show that it's just a sin you're not on regular radio.  Boys, I can't explain to you what this means to me, you guys.  Ryan says, Sam and E-Rock.  I can't explain to you how long I've been...  I'll drop off that was.  Holy shit.  Oh, how dare you.  And by the way, I can't get you a job here.  And the reason is because they just like giving, you know, radio shows to big-time celebrities, 
[00:40:30]  so I'm sorry.  Big stars.  I'm sorry that, you know, guys that actually know how to do radio aren't allowed to be  hired here.  Yeah.  You know, I had a conference call with Jeremy Coleman when my contract was up, and I spoke  with him, and he said...  Oh, what?  What?  What?  What'd you say?  Jeremy Coleman, yes.  I said that we had a conference call, and he said that we were actually good in the talk  radio department when I spoke with him.  Is that true, do you think?  What do you mean you're good?  No, not we're good. 
[00:41:00]  You guys are good.  It's like, no, don't worry, we're good.  Oh!  Yeah, yeah.  What?  There's two shows!  It's Austin Howard, I think.  It's all you need, though, really.  What other talk shows are there for real?  That are actually done by people who do radio?  Yeah.  Zero.  Ron and Fez?  Ron and Fez, sorry.  Yeah, but that's not even in the talk department.  We're not in the talk department.  We're not.  That's true, we're not.  No.  Toucher and Rich?  I'm not Toucher and Rich.  Oh, Kavino and Rich.  Kavino and Rich.  There's one show, and Jay Thomas.  There's two shows.  Oh, Christ.  Jay Thomas does have Ira. 
[00:41:30]  That's true.  So they said...  Never.  Never.  They said we're good in that department?  Wow.  Yeah, well, I mean, that's how much confidence they have in Sam.  I have to admit, he's doing a very good job.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Sam gets, like, every show.  Were you willing to do shows for free?  Yeah.  They will hire people if you do shows for free and give up your name.  Is that good?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When do you give up your name?  And archives.  Some people might have had to give up the rights to their own name.  Their own name. 
[00:42:00]  And not get paid, so they can be heard.  And the stuff they did before.  That might have happened.  What?  Well, you have to go out as Prime Rib Sam Roberts when you leave here.  Wait, wait, wait.  You had to give up the name Prime Prime Sir?  I didn't have to.  I can't wait until he does, though.  I had to admit about using Sam Roberts because nobody else can own that.  It was mine before.  My name.  My name.  That might have happened, or it was, you know, argued back and forth, and maybe this certain person was able to, in the end, keep his name, but not get paid to do the show. 
[00:42:30]  Prime numbers?  Yeah.  Something like that.  Oh, my God.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  They want your name.  Oh, they want your name.  They wanted his name.  Oh, my God.  Look at Jimmy's face.  It's what he does for a living.  They wanted his name.  They wanted.  I don't know how it worked out in the end.  I'll be honest with you, because then, you know, one of these guys, they always march down the hall after the show and tell me what actually happened.  It's one of their over-aggressive contracts.  Just fucking lawyer shit. 
[00:43:00]  And on the show, the name of the show.  They wanted to own the name of the show and not pay him.  I heard that happen with one of the bigger name guys, too, who they got on the channel or whatever, and he was like, you know, you're not owning anything.  And I don't even know if they got him on the channel or if it cost them the deal, but just more of their shitty lawyering.  So, all right, Chad.  Thanks, buddy.  Chad Dukes, everyone.  Thanks, man.  Love you so much.  Thank you so much.  What's the website again for the podcast?  BigOandDukes.com.  If anybody wants to check us out, we used to do evenings when you guys did middays on WJFK in Washington, D.C. 
[00:43:30]  We're not as good as you.  It's a little hard, at least.  And, Jimmy, D.C. Improv.  I bought tickets, even though we had a live event that day.  I missed you, but we'd love to get you on next time, bud.  Yeah, definitely.  I talked to one of your buddies.  He told me what happened.  So, no problem.  Anytime.  All right.  I love you guys.  Thanks, buddy.  A little more info.  A little more info on the Cusack situation.  That was good.  He walked off his own radio show.  The biggest dick ever. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  All right.  Biggest asshole ever.  Yeah.  We'll see.  What, Jimmy?  I just watched that.  I just laughed now.  Oh, that's that.  I can't even believe.  Oh, no, no.  I'm not going to do that.  No, that's got me.  What?  What?  They tried to keep his name.  Oh, you didn't know that one?  No.  Oh.  I don't know how it worked out in the end.  So, because someone will set me right.  Trust me.  But it was absolutely disgust that they wanted his name.  And the name of his show. 
[00:44:30]  I think in the end he won that, but he didn't win the salary thing.  So, I think he does radio for free.  It was definitely.  Does he do radio for free?  I don't know what he makes, but it was definitely a dispute.  God, that's so stupid.  Like, it was not like a will you, no I won't, okay, no problem.  It was a conversation.  I know someone else that they reassigned here actually loses money to do her show.  Oh, well, I think we can figure out who that is.  She loses money to do her show.  That's the deal they gave her.  It's amazing when you're dealing with – I've had to go back and forth with a lawyer about this thing I'm shooting. 
[00:45:00]  Uh, little just nonsense things that should be – and it's amazing how these guys will cling to something.  Uh-oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  Oh, God bless.  How these guys will cling to something.  You all right?  Yes, sir.  Good.  But I'm very frustrated with dealing with this thing.  I was tempted to walk away from shooting this person.  I'm not going to.  But there's one little point that's annoying me so much. 
[00:45:30]  Not with that.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, you're just talking about lawyers in general, right?  Yes, yes, yes.  Nothing to do with serious.  Oh, they're the worst.  With another company.  They're completely –  Oh, you're all stuffy now, Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, you hear me?  My African –  Oh, what happened?  They're completely ruining creativity.  What are you, an African-American?  I know –  It's not funny.  That's racial.  Oh.  Don't do racist stuff here.  I wish we were off the air right there because he just said something really funny, I bet.  I don't go for that stuff.  No, of course not.  But, you know, I think it's acceptable that these guys have to fly home Saturday morning 
[00:46:00]  at what?  First flight out too, right?  Well, I mean, I'm not – yeah, if I got to leave Saturday, like, I've got to check out  of the hotel.  Would you have stayed?  Yeah.  You're fleeing the state.  That's what it is.  You guys literally have to flee the state.  Would you guys have stayed Saturday?  Yeah, I think so.  It's going to be fun.  How many hours are you going to be in Cleveland officially, you think?  Um, not 24.  Not even 24 hours?  You're like on a mission. 
[00:46:30]  It's like a mission.  How do they feel – how do they think this is acceptable?  It's probably like 20, 22.  Because I'll tell you, it's not fun, guys.  To save what?  A mere 120 per room maybe?  130?  It's just terrible, dude.  It's fucking terrible.  And then they just throw millions around for nonsense here and there?  Yeah.  And then when it comes to maybe sort of taking care of an employee, they can't do it?  Why can't they do it?  I don't know.  It's so weird to me.  And it's not about wasting money or, hey, throw away five grand here and there. 
[00:47:00]  It really isn't.  No one – it's like the guys, first of all, would all have stories to come back with.  They would all have fucking audio they would get.  It's like –  Isn't it about $500 we're talking about?  Yeah, not even.  Yeah, it wouldn't have been.  They're trying to save $500.  It's less than that.  So you guys fly in for the broadcast.  But – and the point I try to make to the guy, I'm like, look, you guys got to stop thinking it's just about the broadcast.  If we're in a city or somewhere else, it's – that whole weekend is material for the show.  Yeah, it's Monday.  Because – yeah, you do Friday's show.  Because they didn't want to pay for us. 
[00:47:30]  And I'm like, no, we're still here because it's material for the show.  They didn't want to pay for our Saturday shit for the show.  If you have the whole staff in Cleveland for the whole weekend, Monday's show is finished.  Right.  It's done.  It writes itself.  So even more than Monday, probably leaning – we'll push some of the material into Tuesday.  Right.  All of us are never together.  Right.  Like, it's crazy.  But all it makes me – honestly –  But they do this to everyone, by the way.  Yes.  That's why I like bringing this shit up because a lot of people around here are too scared to speak up.  A lot of people flew to the Super Bowl to do their shows and then had to fly back. 
[00:48:00]  They didn't have a ticket.  It makes you not want to include them in anything because I understand saving money and a company's job is to make money and they can't be –  I do understand that.  But like you said, when you see other stuff happening, it's like, you know what?  I would rather just not have –  But I don't even know if it's saving money because then they'll turn around and make a dumb deal for a dumb show that after the press release no one will even know about.  Like, they get a big bump in a press release and then a week or two, you don't even know about these people. 
[00:48:30]  I bet Haystack smelled bad.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Just looking at that picture.  What about under the titties?  Oh, that's what I mean.  He just looks –  Where do you think he smelled the worst?  Oh, I think –  His skin tags probably stunk.  Oh, God.  See that roll – what I like to call the second armpit.  The side roll?  It's the side roll of fat.  Second armpit?  Yeah.  That makes the second armpit underneath the armpit.  You think that smells worse than his taint?  Oh, well, without having to go into a sexual place because his asshole and taint is beyond anything that could be measured. 
[00:49:00]  He can't even wipe that shit.  Is he dead?  Yeah.  Oh, he has to be.  What about the fat flaps that go, like, over the bottom of the knee?  Like where the thigh comes down.  You know, it just collects a world of hurt.  You know, behind the knees could fucking get a little –  Yeah.  A little gamey.  A little gamey.  Especially after a big match.  I think the worst is that big fold of fucking blubber that hangs over the genitals and just sweats and gets a rash and fucking – 
[00:49:30]  I got one that beats you.  The deep belly button.  Oh, man.  Imagine if that smells like.  Yeah.  Imagine going in there with a big spoon and just sniffing what comes off.  It's probably a good 20 degrees warmer in there just from the bacteria living and moving.  Speaking of smells, and I meant to text and slash tweet Jim Norton, I smelled the bottom of my electric toothbrush, you motherfucker. 
[00:50:00]  It's awful, right?  Oh, God.  Shit.  I wash mine every time I brush my teeth.  I wash my toothbrush and I dry it.  I wash it worse.  Holy fuck.  I mean, if you haven't done that yet.  Oh, my God.  Smell the bottom.  Oh, my God.  Especially when you have it in that base.  Oh, that base.  Smell the base of your toothbrush holder.  I wash mine constantly now.  Disgusting.  Now I'm scrubbing it.  I'll wash it with soap and water.  Not every time, but I always wash it.  Every time I use it, I fucking rinse with water and I towel dry it so it's not collecting. 
[00:50:30]  You're not a Mr. Bungle.  No, I'm not.  Very good.  That's right.  I'm a gallant, not a goofus.  He washes his electric toothbrush.  Good boy, Jimmy.  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  And Mr. Bungle leaves it wet.  Yes, he does.  He's stinky.  Yes, he does.  Speaking of smells, we need girls with their periods to show up in Cleveland.  Ah, what a segue.  Yeah.  Jimmy swears he could smell, he could figure out if a girl's on her period by her smell.  But then again, I don't know if I could do it to somebody who I don't have a sexual history with, 
[00:51:00]  but I'll try, but you can't wear deodorant because it's your pits.  I'm not going to smell your pussy, I'm going to smell your pits, so you can't wear deodorant.  So we need a few girls.  Yeah, like if you have your period, or even if you don't, because you'll need some that don't too,  but definitely if you have your period.  You're doing kind of a pre-game show, right?  Yeah.  So, yeah, you should be trying to find people.  Find people.  Yeah.  But get the word out, ladies.  I hope we have people coming.  Yeah, ladies.  There'll be a good prize for you.  What is it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Figure something out.  I'm sure we'll have to go to an ATM. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, of course we will.  Of course we will.  Jesus.  We have to get our own prize money for our own show.  Like we haven't in the past?  Many times.  Huh?  To pull out your wallet.  Yeah.  I'd rather pull out my wallet and pay for you guys to stay another day.  I told you I wanted to do that, and then it was just the airfare switches were too much  because you have to pay $150 per ticket to switch plus the difference in airfare.  Right.  So it came for the whole thing.  It was like $2,500, and it was just too much.  Yeah, for like four guys. 
[00:52:00]  Too much.  Just terrible.  All right.  Oh, man.  So we got John Cusack promoting The Raven.  We also have Kevin Hart coming in soon.  Uh-huh.  Kevin's here at eight.  Nice.  What movie is he promoting?  It's Steve Harvey's book, actually, which was a massive bestseller.  Think Like a Man, I think it was called.  Okay.  And I got to drive down Broadway and see dumb Kevin's fucking picture on a gigantic Broadway  side on the top of the building.  Yeah.  Look up and see his charming smile.  Got a big movie coming out.  Yeah.  Oh, he makes me sick.  What's his movie? 
[00:52:30]  It's called Think Like a Man.  Think Like a Man, right?  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm confused because I saw Five Year Engagement, and he has a pretty big role in that movie.  Yeah.  He's a good actor, actually.  I hate to say that, but...  He does all right.  You hate to see your friends doing really well, but he can act.  Yeah.  So, Kevin Hart, very excited that he's going to be here today.  And also, Amy Schumer stopping in, and John Cusey.  How about Amy Bootsman?  Oh, because of shoes.  That's a...  She went out on that, you fat fuck. 
[00:53:00]  Welcome back to Cock Talk.  I'm Mistress Vixen.  Today, we're talking about your first man-on-man experience.  We have Mars on the phone from Puerto Rico.  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man, as of yesterday.  Yeah, I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  Mars, I see here you had your first gay experience last night. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Yummy.  So, tell me, what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night?  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I'm anal retentive.  It's so tight.  Mmm, sexy.  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick?  He tells me to lie down on my left side, and I'm facing a particular direction.  And then he pulls his apparatus out.  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me. 
[00:54:00]  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God, about two feet long.  Ooh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second, and all of a sudden, this motherfucker, all the way in  my ass.  Ooh, you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like this, come on, buddy, help me, help me here, work with me, let me do my job.  What was that job? 
[00:54:30]  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it, just letting that rainbow-striped freak flag fly.  Come on, alcohol, alcohol.  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it afterwards.  No, he did it afterwards in front of me.  No, he did.  Ooh, how did he do that?  What is it, tossed salad?  You could toss my salad any time.  Ooh, he licked your asshole clean with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars, you are so naughty. 
[00:55:00]  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you.  This is our secret, don't tell anybody.  Ugh, what I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week when Cock Talk returns and we talk to guys about their first time with a down-low brother, Mars.  I bet you have a story like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Ooh, you little Spanish fly, you've got me all wet.  See you next week for more Cock Talk. 
[00:55:30]  Hey, working hard, playing hard America, this is your blood brother of all things Sonic Bombast, Ted Nugent, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll.  Is this us?  Good morning, everyone.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton going to the Batch Room.  He's got to make wee-wees.  He certainly does. 
[00:56:00]  Man, I almost got in a brawl in Times Square.  Why?  Last night.  Well...  Your fault, right?  Well, wait a minute.  No, I'm not sure.  I was just going for a dumb joke.  I don't know.  I guess it could be interpreted.  It might have been your fault.  It could be interpreted, I guess.  It's all a matter of opinion, you know?  Oh, there goes the mash-up.  Yeah, yeah, you're hot, whatever.  Just walk down a fucking hall.  Jesus Christ.  I like it, though, because she walks funny.  She walks really, like, bow-legged, right? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, she's, like, bow-legged.  She's on her balls of her feet and her toes sometimes.  Like, she just got railed really hard.  It's like she's trying to air out her asshole.  Yeah!  She's airing out her asshole.  That's it.  Now we can't mention the name.  Don't mention the name.  That's HR shit.  Could be any woman around here.  Oh, my God.  You said the show.  What?  You said the show.  I didn't.  You didn't?  I didn't, really.  Ant definitely did. 
[00:57:00]  No, he didn't.  And then you said the thing.  Oh, might have.  No, I didn't.  And there's only one in the show now.  There's only one, really, yeah.  It's her.  She don't mind.  She talked about taking loads on her face.  Oh.  She's talked about a lot of stuff.  All right.  So she's a word.  All right.  Anyway, what happened in Times Square yesterday?  Well, I did Red Eye last night.  It's very fun.  Right.  Gutfeld and the boys.  Nice.  That was a good time.  And when I'm done, I'm catching a cab.  And I already get fucking japped for three cabs. 
[00:57:30]  Literally.  Some Asian people took my fucking cab.  One guy, I went, I'm very good at this one.  And the cab driver always, he looks.  And I give him a wave and he goes, he nods.  And from that moment on, that's my fucking cab.  So I'm walking towards it.  And some fucking Asian guy just opens the door and gets in.  And I'm like, you motherfucker.  You know, and he took off.  So now I'm just pissed. 
[00:58:00]  Happened like two more times where I just got edged out of a cab.  Not so much the other guy being a prick, but it just happens.  So I'm standing on a corner waiting.  And the bane of the fucking New Yorker's existence, those pedal cabs are there.  And they're all over down there.  Yeah, they are.  They're coming around the corner.  You know, they're just fucking, they pedal around.  They're just circling.  Yeah.  And they're looking for someone that wants to be on a bike. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  And I got my, I got my arm up.  I'm looking for a cab.  You know, I'm done.  I'm hailing.  Why didn't you take one of those guys?  Exactly.  No.  Were you going home?  No, no.  But I had to be down to like fucking 15th and 10th.  Okay.  I'm not taking a pedal cab.  No.  From Times Square to 15th.  So, um, so this motherfucker is, they keep coming around and I'm looking for a cab and  they keep going, cab, taxi. 
[00:59:00]  It's like, you're not a fucking taxi.  You're a glorified big wheel.  You fucking asshole.  I'm not going to, I'm not going to sit there like an idiot in the back of your dumb fucking  tricycle.  I want to, so I just kept going like every time they passed by, um, I'm like, you want  a taxi?  I'm like, yeah, with a motor.  I'm like, I want one with a motor.  Keep going.  Keep moving.  And they just kept asking.  I was just more infuriated because there were no fucking cabs.  Can I stop you for a second?  Why, why are you scared of the subways? 
[00:59:30]  You know how quickly you would have been downtown in a subway?  It's kind of, it's, it didn't work out well.  But do you do subways?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, okay.  Believe me, I do.  I got no fear, motherfucker.  No, no, I'll do subways.  Okay, all right.  The biggest thing with the subway is I don't know where, where the fucking shit goes and  which train to get and shit.  So on your iPhone app, you have a cool subway.  Oh, that sounds like the future, Jimmy.  I'm very scared.  You pop it up.  You go number one, bingo, bongo.  There it is. 
[01:00:00]  You know exactly where you're going.  Well, you ask somebody, excuse me, where does the train go?  You hear it, doesn't it?  But I don't know.  Never talk to the strangers.  Oh, what the heck?  Everybody helps you.  These pricks were going around and I, so I yell at one guy because I'm just, I've had  it at this point.  Taxi.  I go, no, fuck off.  Oh, shit.  Now he just, he fucked off.  He kept pedaling.  But there was another guy behind him. 
[01:00:30]  This Russian guy.  Watch out.  Was he in a hurry?  Yes, he was in a hurry.  In New York City, Russians way scarier than the blacks.  No, not really.  Yes, and I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was.  Russians are scary, man.  Well, this guy really had like no fear.  I don't fuck with you.  So he goes, he gets, he gets off of his tricycle and he's like, nah, fuck you, motherfucker. 
[01:01:00]  Fuck you.  I kick your fucking ass.  And, and now I got it.  Wait, and you weren't even yelling at him?  No.  I was yelling at the guy in front of him.  Holy shit.  But he took it like personally because I, I think I, I think I yelled out something like,  keep pedaling queer.  Or just something.  Like I was so angry and, and the Russian guy got really upset.  So he starts trying to get off of his tricycle to come after me.  And now the doorman to one of the hotels sees this whole thing going on and he's like trying 
[01:01:30]  to hold the Russian guy back.  But now I'm there and I'm so pissed.  I'm like, fuck off.  And I did that thing where you spread your arms apart.  Like, come on, motherfucker.  Come on.  And the Russian guy's like, I kick your fucking ass.  I'm like, fuck off.  And the doorman's trying to fucking hold him back.  And there are, there's a battalion of NYPD in the street.  But they're searching trucks. 
[01:02:00]  That's what they do down there now.  They block off part of the road.  They have a lane that's coned off and the, uh, the fucking, uh, trucks pulling.  They got the mirrors, the dogs.  So the whole street's lined with cops and they turn and now they're just looking.  They're just looking at this situation unfolding to see if they have to step in.  It was bad, huh?  It was, it was ready to go.  If the door, if the doorman wasn't there, it was ready to go.  Uh, yeah.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I was so fucking pissed. 
[01:02:30]  I, I, I take the advice now of, of people that go, if you're going to fight, just immediately  start fighting.  Like the, the worst thing when you watch videos of people that get their asses handed to them,  it's always the guy that's standing there going, yeah, yeah.  Or, or, well, you know, you want to do this?  Except because it, you step up and just belt someone in the face.  You walk away.  So that's my new school of thought is to fighting.  So I was just going to, like, if he started coming over to me, I was just going to lunge 
[01:03:00]  and punch him in the face.  Now let me ask you, did you see all those cops there?  Oh, I saw all the cops there.  So you knew you were, you had a little help.  You knew you could get one good one in.  I could probably get a good one in before it, but it worked against me too, because you  know, if I'm on the fucking ground and then the cops don't know, they're going to take  both of us and smash our, our heads against the fucking wall or something.  Wow.  But I was so fucking angry.  Why, why were you wound so tight yesterday?  Because I didn't want to deal with the fucking cabs. 
[01:03:30]  That sucked.  And then the, the, the, the little tricycles just asking me every time and me having to  go, no, no, no.  It just got progressively more angry.  At first I'm like, no, thanks.  No.  And it ended with fucking queer.  I was just angry.  So what, how did this situation end?  Uh, fucking, uh, the, the goddamn Russian got back on his tricycle and pedaled his little  ass off down Broadway.  And how much longer for a cab for you?  Um, it was pretty quick after that. 
[01:04:00]  It was pretty fast, but I still had to fend off a few more of these fucking little bicycle  dicks.  Yeah.  They're everywhere.  I can't stand the fucking things.  No.  You know what?  If I, if people want to take a ride in one of those, they will say, sir.  Sir, can I have a ride?  If you're hailing a cab, you want a metal one from this goddamn century.  It's not Japan.  You're Rick Sean motherfuckers.  So you were, you were going to scrap last night. 
[01:04:30]  It was the closest I've ever come to scrapping in, I mean, in, in my adult life.  Were you worried?  Not at all.  I was like, I was psyched.  I was kind of psyched about it.  Were you going to use these?  Yeah.  Or this?  No, no.  I was, you can't do that.  I was just going to belt them in the face really hard.  I don't know what I'm saying out there.  Really hard.  Maybe you're a kickboxer.  But those Russians, they're crazy.  I know that.  Why don't you go with the, uh, an illegal?  I go with the illegals.  What do you mean?  The black cars that stop and go, hey.  I try, but with all those cops there, they were very leery about stopping. 
[01:05:00]  Those guys are way nicer than the cabbies.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I would grab one of those up in a second.  Those are basically, uh, basically guys that are hired to bring some dummy into the city  and then they got like hours to kill.  So they try to make a little side money.  Yeah.  And they'll pull up to you and then ask you where you're going and stuff.  And they, they look a bit shady at times.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, uh, in general, they're great guys.  But in Times Square, you just couldn't, you know, you couldn't flag one of those down.  They, they kind of frown on that.  And how they rape us with the cab fares and stuff. 
[01:05:30]  I don't feel guilty at all.  No.  At all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a, that was a close one.  I could, I was amazed that the, uh, the Russian actually got so upset that I called the other  guy and told him to fuck off.  Well, he fuck off.  I tell you to fuck off.  Cause it hit too close to home.  He knows that it's a shitty job.  You know, he's from Russia and he came over here and he's hoping to, you know, make it  big.  When I was in Russia, I was a nuclear engineer.  Now I peddled motherfucker around Times Square. 
[01:06:00]  Fuck this job.  Dude, I know I'm going to scrap in the playground eventually with this kid shit.  I sure have.  It's different, Uncle Paul.  You see the Russian fathers.  Holy fuck.  They are intimidating, man.  Yeah.  They're all like that fucking.  I can use some of my psychological shit with people.  Those Russians, man.  I can't figure them out.  I can't figure a way in yet psychologically.  They are scary in general.  They're very cold people.  I am stereotyping, obviously.  They're cold. 
[01:06:30]  Holy fuck.  They're not typically.  That's why Yakov Swarov was such an anomaly.  He was a funny Russian.  Ha ha.  And of course, the magnetic dinner tray.  But you know what I mean?  They're not.  They're not known as fun guys.  That would have been ironic if I had a magnetic dinner tray and smashed that Russian in the  face with it.  A lot of people are asking if it was a stand your ground type situation last night.  There is no stand your ground in New York State.  Yeah.  So, no, it wasn't a stand your ground situation.  There was no fucking need or any indication there would be a need for the use of deadly 
[01:07:00]  physical force.  It looked like it was going to be a little brawl.  Just a few fisticuffs thrown, but never got to that point.  All right.  People are worried that you're fist fighting.  No, I didn't.  I was just saying.  You came close, though.  That, yeah, I didn't.  I need someone to help me out with this Cromartie guy.  He plays for the Jets.  He likes to have kids. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, he likes to come inside.  He loves that to me, yes.  He loves to come inside.  He doesn't really, like Tim Tebow, he doesn't really believe in protection.  They're kind of the same guy for different reasons.  And I swear to you, I saw on the front page of the sports section a mere two days that  he had his 10th kid.  10th kid.  I swear I saw that.  Today in the paper, I'm very confused, and I think maybe Travis or someone can help me 
[01:08:00]  out here.  There's a sonogram where his lady is going to now have number 11 and number 12.  She's having twins.  But I swear to you, they just congratulated him in the sports section for having his 10th  kid.  And I know you've got to wait at least, like, I don't know, at least two months before you  can even attempt to have sex after your lady gives birth.  And this guy broke, too, or some shit?  There's the sonogram for the twins. 
[01:08:30]  But they just announced his 10th kid was born literally a few days ago.  He has potent seed, man.  But she turned around and got pregnant again?  She literally just gave birth, I think, a mere few days ago.  So fertile.  Or is it another woman?  Does anyone know what's going on here?  I know for sure.  How many baby mama?  The twins would give siblings to the two children.  Antonio, who's 28, already has with his wife, or whoever this chick is, Terica. 
[01:09:00]  Wait, he's 28?  And he's looking at his 12th kid already?  As well as the eight children he has with other women scattered across the United States.  Scattered?  They're scattered.  Why do you need to get women pregnant?  I don't understand that.  I understand the sex thing, but I don't understand why you have the need to get women pregnant all  over the place.  There's some kind of cultural phenomenon there that we just don't really understand.  And I'm not just saying it's relegated to the black community. 
[01:09:30]  White trash families down there that live with mountain men type families, they do the  same thing, usually with one woman.  A lot of times people who come inside are people who just don't have the ability or the thinking  to look forward.  A lot of people do that because they just, they know, of course they know you can get pregnant,  they understand the financial implications, but they're in the moment people. 
[01:10:00]  They're the type of people that will spend all their money the next morning after the  payday.  Like, there's people that are just like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's the mentality.  Anybody you see with that many kids all over the place is probably someone who just sees  the moment.  I'm coming and it feels great.  Think ahead.  Yeah.  But I was always, I was always scared shitless of getting women pregnant.  Right.  I mean, it scared the living daylights out of me.  Yeah.  But for some people, I guess, whatever, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll never get it.  In April.  Amy is sick.  She's not coming yet.  She texted.  She's sick.  Amy's sick. 
[01:10:30]  She's sick, yeah.  In April, which is this month, it was announced he recently had his second child with wife,  Terica.  Terica.  And that's the same woman who's having the twins.  It's like Eric going to tea.  Exactly.  That name's not in the baby book.  Terica is not.  No.  No.  That's not in the baby book.  Terica gave birth what day?  I don't know the exact day.  And is this the same woman that is now pregnant again?  Yes.  She gave birth in April of 2012.  That's the month we're in now.  It's this month.  And that sonogram, I think your first doctor's visit is what, six weeks in or something like 
[01:11:00]  that?  No, she couldn't have just given birth in April.  That's why I'm confused.  Does anyone know what's going on here?  I don't know what the birth date of that last kid was, but it was very recent.  You're definitely right about it.  And she's now pregnant with twins.  Yes.  And the sonogram is such where she's been pregnant a while.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That's crazy.  He just comes deep.  Me and my brother are...  He just comes deep.  Me and one of my brothers are barely a year apart. 
[01:11:30]  And I thought that was crazy.  That's a whole Catholic thing when we were growing up.  Yeah.  I'm May 23rd.  My brother's June 6th of the following year.  So it's just over a year difference.  And I thought that was crazy.  But then you meet people that have siblings that are less than a year older or younger  than them.  That's crazy shit.  How would you do that?  I don't know.  There's something going on there that I just can't grasp.  I don't get it.  I just can't grasp it.  Yeah.  A lot of Irish Catholic families like that too.  Yeah.  12 kids.  But there's something else that goes here with the pregnant... 
[01:12:00]  All different women too.  Like a bunch of different women.  Not all different, but a bunch of different women.  There's just something there that needs to be addressed.  But you can't.  What do you think it is?  I don't know.  There's some kind of racial thing.  There's some kind of social thing that's going on.  I don't know what it is.  But it seems to be something that is indicative to certain communities.  And it's just not addressed or it's just blown off.  No one really thinks about it. 
[01:12:30]  I think it's horrendous for a family.  You know?  You can't be a responsible father when you've got kids with all kinds of moms around.  It just ain't going to fucking work.  I got one kid.  A lot of work.  A lot of responsibility.  So it's so easy for me to say, if you're having 12 kids, you're not raising your kids responsibly.  There's no fucking way.  And so you're just like, all right, there's no way.  You're getting these women pregnant and that's it for you. 
[01:13:00]  At that point, you're like, hey, man, you're pretty much on your own.  I'll kind of try to do what I can for you.  Maybe throw a little money your way.  But the guy's not raising 12 kids.  Yeah.  There's no fucking way.  And that is irresponsible.  Very silly.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  There's no way he can be attentive and a father to that many kids that are scattered around the country like that.  What's he visiting the kids?  And shit just is something on it.  It's just it just perpetuates hard, hard times for the kids. 
[01:13:30]  And and they wind up growing up and doing the same fucking thing.  Oh, come on.  Get a hold on something.  Jesus Christ.  It would be fun to have like a version of myself, like an Asian version, a black version, a Jewish version.  Like one of each would be cool as shit.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, man.  How great would that be?  Wouldn't you want to have one of every every every kind? 
[01:14:00]  That would be unique.  If I was one of these guys where I didn't give a fuck, I would at least do it that way.  Because that would keep it interesting.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  There's the Asian Opie.  There's my Asian son.  There's my black son.  Gleg Hughes.  Wouldn't that be kind of fun?  That's a reality show.  See that.  Yeah.  Me and many, many different versions of of me.  It would take a while to cultivate.  Of course.  Yeah.  You collect all of them.  Yeah.  Collect one of each.  Ted Nugent. 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  The Nuge.  Ted Nugent.  I tweeted yesterday who gives a shit.  And then, of course, the other side said, well, when the dad had to do the other thing,  we cared.  When I fucking attack these political fucking topics that come up, I'm not playing a side.  People just take it personally.  Yeah, they do.  Again, it's like what Jimmy was saying before.  It's like, what do you mean who gives a shit when Bush?  Wait, it would be the other guy, right?  See, now I'm even confused.  When someone said something about Bush. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, that's what they had to say yesterday.  I'm like, I wrote the guy.  I'm like, look, I just go after all of them because I think they're all fucking pieces  of shit.  But this time it's Ted Nugent saying something about Obama.  Yeah.  What did he say?  Well, he said something like, I think the thing that got him in a little bit of a jam here  is the fact that he said, if Obama gets reelected, he, meaning Ted, Ted Nugent, would either  end up dead or in jail, which leads one to believe that what he meant was that something 
[01:15:30]  would happen to him.  Well, the dummies would take that.  Yeah.  What did he mean?  Well, it's longer than that.  So why don't we listen to it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because the news ain't going to give you this.  They're just going to give you the quick soundbite.  This is what Ted Nugent said, I believe, yesterday, sometime yesterday.  If you can't get Uncle Ted a couple of hundred people each, each of you, some of you, I bet 
[01:16:00]  you can get a couple thousand.  Your goal should be able to get a couple of thousand people per person who's here to vote  for Mitt Romney in November.  If you don't know that our government is wiping its ass with the Constitution, you're  living under a rock someplace.  And if there's a dead soldier, an airman, a Marine, a seaman, a hero of the military  that just got his legs blown off for the U.S. Constitution, and we got a president and 
[01:16:30]  attorney general who doesn't even like the Constitution.  We got four Supreme Court justices.  Can you pause that real quick?  And people would argue that that soldier didn't get his legs blown off for the Constitution.  That soldier got his legs blown off because he was sent to fight a situation that we shouldn't  be involved in.  So which would probably bring the criticism back to the prior administration.  Just saying.  That type of talk just fucking...  That's rhetoric. 
[01:17:00]  Like, that type of rhetoric just annoys me.  Yeah.  It's almost like saying, terrorists are all cowards.  Yeah, that sounds great, but it's just not the truth.  Strap a bomb on yourself.  Yeah, that's not an act of cowards.  They're pieces of garbage.  Right.  They're shit.  But to say they're cowards is just childish rhetoric that doesn't accurately paint what's  happening.  Yeah.  And these guys did not go over there to get their legs blown off for the Constitution.  They probably would be willing to do that fighting for it here. 
[01:17:30]  The soldiers are brave motherfuckers, man.  I firmly believe they would do that.  But that's not why they got their legs blown off over there.  So don't make it look like they went over there fighting for the Constitution and the  current administration.  That's just bullshit.  Who don't believe in the Constitution.  Does everybody know here that four of the Supreme Court justices not only determine you  who don't have the right to keep and bear arms, four Supreme Court justices sign their 
[01:18:00]  name to a declaration that Americans have no fundamental right to self-defense?  That sounds like a stoned hippie.  What is that, loose teeth?  Yes.  What is that?  What is that?  That sounds like a stoned hippie.  Four of the Supreme Court justices.  I love when Anthony picks out the most subtle thing.  Now I'm not going to be able to listen to this.  Heb.  Head.  I love when Anthony picks out subtle things, too. 
[01:18:30]  However, this sounds like the Liberty Bell ring every time he talks.  Good point.  Sounds like the Allentown whistle.  Yeah.  The start of that Billy Joel song.  Every time he says certain words, fucking workers are leaving their jobs with their lunch  pails.  Punch their time clock.  Stoned hippie.  That doesn't sound like a Supreme Court anything.  It sounds like a supremely intellectually vacuous punk.  To think that a human could think that humans don't have a basic right to self-defense is so 
[01:19:00]  bizarre to me as to my brain can't accept the information.  And if you want more of those kinds of evil, anti-American people in the Supreme Court, then don't get involved and let Obama take office again.  Because I tell you this right now, if Barack Obama becomes the president in November again, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year.  Being at the NRA event, God bless you. 
[01:19:30]  Wow.  Now, you could take away from that that he's insinuating that he would try something against the president and end up either dead or in jail.  Well, that's the obvious.  But what are you going to say?  What else could it be?  What else could it be?  Well, I'm asking you.  I don't know.  That's why I said wow, because usually there's a little gray area there.  He could be feeling a persecution.  That something's going to happen to him where he's going to be killed or he'll be thrown in jail for having a gun.  Now, you're right.  It could be that he's got his little camp up there and he loves his guns and whatnot. 
[01:20:00]  And he's thinking that with the rights being taken away and your liberties, that they would have to come and get him.  Or, yeah, if they take my gun, somebody will fucking come after me or I'll go to jail for having my gun, defending myself.  That makes more sense.  That's not necessarily an aggressive thing.  You're right.  He's a smart guy, though.  He probably should explain it a little better.  Yeah, maybe.  Let's see if he does, because there's a little more to the clip.  Event, God bless you. 
[01:20:30]  Good indicator.  But if you can't go home and get everybody in your lives to clean house in this vile, evil, America-hating administration,  I don't even know what you're made out of.  If you can't galvanize and promote and recruit people to vote for Mitt Romney, we're done.  We'll be a suburb of Indonesia next year.  No, you won't be.  Our president and attorney general, our vice president, Hillary Clinton, they're criminals. 
[01:21:00]  They're criminals.  Oh, shut up.  Criminal.  Just shut up.  It's like, just shut up.  Really.  You don't like Uncle Ted?  No, I don't dislike Uncle Ted.  I actually – I think Uncle Ted can be an ass, but I don't dislike him either.  I think he's a – I like the fact that he's not afraid to say what he wants to say.  Sure.  I respect that.  And I agree with him on most of the Second Amendment issues he talks about.  I think he's too extreme. 
[01:21:30]  I don't think you have the right to own anything you want to – and Ant and I would probably differ on that.  But I do think that he's right about the right to bear arms.  I agree with the Second Amendment.  All right.  He continues here.  Ted Nugent.  Let's get right to the guts of it, shall we, Dan?  Oh, what is the second clip?  What's the setup on that?  I guess he –  I'm not sure what that clip is.  Oh, Ted responds.  Okay.  Ted responds.  So he said what he said, and then everyone was like, holy fuck, and it was trending on Twitter, blah, blah, blah.  So someone got a hold of Ted to explain further. 
[01:22:00]  Here it is.  Let's get right to the guts of it, shall we, Dan?  Yes.  Saul Alinsky.  This is the Saul Alinsky Rule for Radicals playbook.  The Nazis and the Klan hate me.  Yes.  I'm a black Jew at a Nazi Klan rally.  All right.  Maybe not, Ted.  And there are some power-abusing, corrupt monsters in our federal government that despise me because I have the audacity to speak the truth. 
[01:22:30]  The golden rule in the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights are guiding forces for the greatest quality of life in the history of humankind.  And anyone that disagrees with me disagrees with that.  He pontificates.  He punched for one second.  Yeah, sure.  That's not necessarily true, Ted.  I disagreed with you before.  But I happen...  And you don't agree with the Bill of Rights.  Yes, I understand that Ted Nugent is all things red, white, blue, and apple pie incorporated into one just living embodiment of freedom and justice. 
[01:23:00]  But sometimes we see things a little different.  Well, then you don't support the Bill of Rights.  No, no, no.  I understand.  He's the stars, the stripes, and the eagle.  I got you, Ted.  I hear you.  We're all just communist pinko faggots who don't love the Constitution.  You said it.  You said it, brother.  Not me.  Well, do you agree with everything Ted says about this?  I don't agree with every point.  Well, then you don't agree with the Bill of Rights.  Yes.  Ted, I don't know about that one point. 
[01:23:30]  Well, then shove a dick up your ass and move to Russia because we're going to be a suburb of Indonesia and Obama's a criminal.  Look, I don't care if people like Obama.  That's fine.  But let's be honest.  I mean, I don't know enough about the economy, and you could argue about the fucking housing market collapse because a very liberal mentality forced those banks to give loans they shouldn't have had to give.  But I know a lot of what happened on Wall Street, you cannot blame on liberals like Obama. 
[01:24:00]  You just can't.  You just fucking can't.  So just to say one guy's a criminal and the other ones aren't, stop sounding like an asshole.  Just stop it.  It's rhetoric.  It's like if you're going to be a smart guy, be a smart guy.  Don't be a rhetoric spewing ass.  Well, you do sound like the founding fathers.  You're pretty much saying the founding fathers are assholes then because to call Ted an asshole is to call the people that wrote the Bill of Rights an asshole. 
[01:24:30]  Well, I wouldn't call Ted an asshole, but I would love to hear – and they always get mad when you raise this.  But when they obsess over the Bill of Rights, which I do think are a great document, but to not see the hypocrisy in the people who wrote it, well, that was a different time.  You know, it's like why aren't you calling them criminals, the people whose very words you are accusing people of being anti-American if they don't cling to every syllable the way you see it interpreted?  Why are you not looking at the little interpretation of people who wrote this who lived their lives totally different, who counted certain people as three-fifths of a – however you want to fucking phrase it. 
[01:25:00]  If you say freedom for everyone and you have slaves, you are a hypocritical piece of shit.  I'm sorry.  The document you wrote is amazing.  And some listener raised a good point when I said this one, that they were fucking – that they were really good at forming a government.  Like, they really were.  But that rhetoric spewing stuff without balance is annoying. 
[01:25:30]  Drives me fucking nuts from anybody.  Like, you know, a guy – a total left-wing guy drives me crazy too.  People think that makes them committed.  I stick by – shut your fucking face.  Where there's no room to breathe or shift a little one way or the other or compromise, yeah.  If you're that way on either side, you're an asshole.  You're a fucking asshole.  And you're not just committed.  You're stubbornly clinging to something because it's become your identity.  Right on.  You should go fuck yourself. 
[01:26:00]  And I don't – and again, it sounds like I'm shitting on Nugent.  He irritates me, but I really – I actually genuinely do like Ted Nugent.  Oh, he's entertaining.  He is, but I like the fact that he's also a guy who's not afraid to say things.  He's not – he has no fear of repercussions, which I admire.  I do admire that.  But he doesn't like anyone else's opinion in the room ever.  No.  But I've never seen him want anybody punished for their opinion, so it's like I got no issue.  Yeah, yeah, fair enough.  But he did annoy me when he thought, like, you're not the only patriot, Ted.  You're not the only guy that values this country. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Here's the last minute of what he said.  A brain-dead, soulless, heartless idiot that I could not be more proud that this soulless, heartless idiot feebly attempts to find fault with Ted Nugent because I am on the right track, and she just encourages me to stand stronger.  I almost look like Michael the Archangel.  I'm like Mother Teresa with a guitar compared to Obama's gang.  See, right there. 
[01:27:00]  Examine her voting rights.  Not one word of substance.  Ha ha, yes.  Not one word of anything that wasn't rhetoric-fucking-laden self-promotion.  Yeah.  Who cares what you are?  We get it.  We know you play the guitar.  Mother Teresa with a guitar.  But it's like, what does that even mean?  What does it mean?  Stop just saying things.  How silly would she look with a guitar, by the way?  Stupid.  She'd be an asshole, especially with no place to plug it in in Calcutta.  Oh, God. 
[01:27:30]  Just plug it in some naked person's asshole.  Just wandering around looking for an outlet.  Yeah.  What's she going to do?  Yeah, hey.  She's dressed in a fucking loincloth with a crossbow.  Her mission is to find an outlet.  Yeah, she's playing the solo from Cheech and Chong's next movie.  All the people from Calcutta, their fucking rotted teeth are falling out.  I don't know that reference.  Fuck.  Oh, Cheech and Chong's next movie.  It's a funny guitar solo.  I don't remember.  It shakes the whole house up.  Ted Newt.  I'm going to look it up on YouTube today.  45 more seconds.  Oh, yay.  Her voting record. 
[01:28:00]  Listen to Nancy Pelosi, this subhuman scoundrel.  Hate him.  She's hate him.  Very hate him.  She is.  This is an elected official, Dana, who said, you don't need to sign.  You don't need to read this.  You need to sign it.  Oh.  Yeah.  I mean, the wicked witch of what?  If you've got a problem with Ted Nugent, you are weird because I reek of truth.  The evidence that supports every word I say is inescapable, irrefutable. 
[01:28:30]  It's like a tsunami of glowing obvious truth and facts and evidence.  It's a wrestling fucking...  And people who disagree with Ted Nugent are idiots.  See, the odds...  If you disagree with him, you're an idiot.  You're an idiot, yeah.  Yeah, but that's what we...  I hate to tell Ted, but that's what everybody thinks about our opinion.  Right.  We think it's right.  We all think everybody who agrees with us is an idiot.  Yeah, yeah.  But you're not this...  You're not this tornado of wisdom and strength while the rest of us are in awe of your truth. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, God.  This guy tells the truth.  Get out of here.  Ah, well, you know what?  Ted, he tells the truth all the time.  I have my opinions, but I can't refute him.  Heck no.  Yeah.  Red, white, and blue embodied in one six-foot-something tall drink of honesty.  God bless you.  With that, we're going to break because Kevin Hart's going to be here any moment.  Oh.  I'm going to get a break in before he gets here, okay?  And also... 
[01:29:30]  John Cusack.  Oh.  John Cusack at 9 o'clock.  And I found the clip of Cromartie talking about his kids.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about this, and someone reminded me on Twitter, and I thank you.  Cromartie was asked to name all his kids when they did that Hard Knocks thing.  Right.  On HBO.  And, well, we got the clip, is all I'll say.  Ooh.  For the people that have never heard this clip, you might want to stick around for that.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Channel.  Doi bu qi, wa mi le lu, ching ni bang ma.  On Sirius XM. 
[01:30:00]  Welcome back to Yenta Explorers with Marge and Gertrude.  Let's join the ladies as they head down to the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean to explore the Titanic.  Boy, this elevator sure the heck is taking quite a long time.  Ah, ha, ha.  I hope no one pushes all the buttons on the way back up.  Oh, stopping at every depth.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, this is like going up into the plane, but going down into the ocean.  Where's the clouds and stuff? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, you're funny.  Up where's the whales and the sonar and not?  Hey, stop here.  I'm going to get off and buy some girdles.  Uh, floor five.  Shoes, hats, and gloves.  Ah, ladies' foundations and other picture postcards.  I'd love to go cave diving under there.  That's craziness.  Sure would.  Hey, cave diving, what are you doing?  Oh, let's journey to it.  Why don't they go down there and just lift it up with a bunch of ropes?  Just pick it up.  Push it.  It's like, uh, it's underwater. 
[01:31:00]  Water, everything's lighter than the water.  I'd light a ciggy down there in a second.  You can bet.  Quick, get me a Benson and Hedges.  I see the core.  Where's my Chesterfields?  Quick, get me a moor.  I see the big circle of fire.  I'm smoking.  I'd love to have a Titanic pickle sandwich.  Hold the relish, darling.  This is the last one of its kind.  I'm going to have a little bit of pickle with a side of pickle juice.  Get a starline plate.  I'm starving.  Crikey.  The Yent has made it all the way down.  But will they make it back up? 
[01:31:30]  Find out next time on Yent Explorers with Marge and Gertrude.  Sirius XM, the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be right back. 
[01:32:00]  Waiting for Kevin Hart.  Jimmy knows Kevin Hart real well.  He's done the show once.  Yes.  We like Kevin Hart.  Yeah, he's fun.  I like his stuff.  I like his stand-up.  Yeah, he's a very, very funny guy.  Starting to do a lot of movies.  I just saw him in Five Year Engagement, which is a chick flick, a rom-com. 
[01:32:30]  But it wasn't bad.  I liked it.  It's Jason Segel's latest movie.  That's coming out soon.  And Jason should be in to promote that.  But Kevin Hart had a pretty big role in it.  He's blowed up.  But it wasn't his movie.  He's coming in to promote Think Like a Man, right?  That's his movie.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's his movie.  He's one of the guys in it.  Gabriel Union's in it.  Chris Brown.  Jerry Ferrara.  And I don't know who Megan Good is.  Or Tarigi P. Henson.  I don't know who that is.  I don't know these people. 
[01:33:00]  I don't know what they do.  Yes.  Tell them you don't want to act with them.  They'll understand.  Believe me.  Thank you.  It's a little Merle Haggard.  No, no.  Merle.  Oh, Troy Donahue.  That was Troy Donahue.  Oh, it was.  Troy Donahue.  Why was I way off?  I don't know.  All right.  Well, we should be doing something here.  I think we should be doing the Kevin Horne interview.  Oh, he's not in yet.  Is Roland down there to meet him?  Can you?  Hi. 
[01:33:30]  Take this to the studio.  I just texted Roland.  I said, Kevin, here yet?  He replied, not yet.  All right.  All right.  So then we can play the Cromartie thing.  Yeah, let's hear that.  So Cromartie.  Playing it here?  Oh, you know.  Cromartie, mystery, delicious appetizers.  So the 10th kid, he plays with the Jets.  Cromartie's 10th kid was born when?  Okay.  Apparently, she tweeted a couple days ago.  And I tried to find it, but she tweets so much that I just couldn't locate the exact tweet. 
[01:34:00]  Apparently, she's saying that their son was born a year ago.  Oh, so the papers had it all fucked up because they congratulate him on the front page of the sports section, I think, two days ago.  Yeah, I think maybe it only came out publicly a couple weeks ago.  But she's saying that he's a year old.  So that would make a lot more sense because I have no idea how it's possible for any of this to happen if he was born a couple weeks ago.  That's what I was thinking.  Were you?  Yeah, kind of.  Yeah, I guess. 
[01:34:30]  We got to just do this quick because of Kevin Hart.  I don't want to fuck up his time here.  Well, we got at least three minutes.  Okay, so the 10th kid was born.  Now we're looking at a year ago.  And now it comes out today that she's pregnant with twins, which will make his 11th and 12th kid.  Yes.  Leads to a clip from Hard Knocks where they ask Cromartie, can you name all your kids?  Good enough question.  I mean, if you're a responsible father, you'd be able to name all your kids, right?  I think so.  If you're a responsible father, you wouldn't have fucking a dozen kids all over the country.  Right.  True.  But at the very least, you'd be able to name them is our point here. 
[01:35:00]  This is Cromartie when he was asked that question.  What is going on with her half?  We have Alonzo, who is five.  I have Karis, who is three.  I have my junior, which is three.  I have my daughter, who just turned three as of yesterday.  What are their names?  I have another son named Tyler.  Yes, he turns three in December. 
[01:35:30]  We got another daughter that was born.  He's scratching his head like he's doing math.  I know the daughter that was born, named Leibani, who's two years old.  And I have my newborn with my wife.  Her name is Jersey.  Jersey.  Well, you can have 49 more kids and name them.  You ran out of names, I guess.  Yeah.  The funny thing is, in there, he had three kids that were three years old.  Yeah.  And they weren't triplets.  No.  And he was just like, my daughter, my son. 
[01:36:00]  Like, you couldn't say what their names were on all of them.  That would be a nightmare in my mind.  Wow.  That is a nightmare in my mind.  Oh.  He didn't name them all, is the point.  No, he didn't.  You start saying my daughter, my son.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your son.  And his son's name is Jagger.  Jagger?  Yeah.  And Jersey is spelled J-U-R-Z-I-E.  Of course it is.  Just like New Jersey.  Why wouldn't it be?  Yes.  Jersey. 
[01:36:30]  Boy, she's going to get that wrong on, too.  Yes.  Oh, man.  And you know what they say about Jersey?  It's going to be all, every guy who goes out there is going to be like, ugh.  Ugh.  Who?  Yeah.  Smells.  Wow.  That's a terrible name, Jersey.  Who thought that was a good name?  What, the other ones were good?  J-U-R-Z-I-E.  What the other ones were?  I've seen those same names.  Jersey.  How about just, how about just Melissa?  How about Emily? 
[01:37:00]  How about, uh.  Or fucking.  Ashley's.  Lori.  I could name them all.  What, there's no Muriels down at the office?  Muriel.  Fucking crammed in rules.  About Becky Sue.  Right.  That's a nice name for a young African-American girl.  Becky Sue.  Becky Sue.  Put a hyphen in there.  Maybe she'd get an interview past the resume.  You know?  I think that affects a lot of young black children when they go to get a job. 
[01:37:30]  You know?  Not if the boss is black.  Well, I understand.  But if the boss might have, you know, some racism in him, it's not really helping out.  Because then you prejudge based on the name, and you don't really get to know the person.  Coming up?  Okay.  He's coming up?  He's coming up.  He's coming up.  What?  What the way?  To.  All right.  Jeez Louise.  Yeah, I saw the trailer for that movie.  It looked pretty good, though.  Let me see the trailer.  I'll be looking at it.  Called, uh, think like a man. 
[01:38:00]  Think like a man.  Travis types very quickly.  Yeah.  Like a woman.  Well, like a man.  Who knows how to type.  You find that other audio?  I'm not sure.  Dang, you're losing the games for us.  You're not even using the picks.  You shot one for 27.  I'm not the one that's not coming off the picks.  I'm not the one that's not coming off the picks.  Y'all done here?  We want to play some full court.  Oh, yeah.  We're good.  No, we're not.  Y'all want the court? 
[01:38:30]  You play for the court.  That's what real men do.  Say, I want to play for you.  Am I stuttering?  You're not going to prank us.  I ain't no metapeaches.  I am serious.  People come in here and they think they got us.  They don't have nothing.  Oh.  This spring.  Bam.  Damn it.  Baby, we're going to slap taste.  I'll be right back.  I'll be right here.  Okay.  Chris Brown.  Oh, you were an animal last night.  So, babe, I was thinking we could go on our first real date.  Yeah, babe.  We should do that.  No.  Yes.  No, you didn't.  You took my coffee.  Guys.  Yeah.  Happy Valentine's Day, sweetie.  And you too, Mom. 
[01:39:00]  I'm just going to leave you two alone.  I'll call you.  Or not.  We'll be guys.  Shelly's slant.  Damn.  No bucks and cards.  Whoa, she's so sweet to the eyes.  She walked right by with her nose in the sky.  That's my car.  She don't even know who I am.  I'm a two-piece.  Okay, where's the window?  All right.  The dark night strikes again.  Hey, boys.  But women have had enough.  What is the problem with men of this generation?  Ladies, till you understand the mindset of a man, you are never going to win in a game of love.  Act like a lady, but think like a man. 
[01:39:30]  We're tied up.  Now, one book is changing the game.  What are your short-term goals?  What are your long-term goals?  What are your views on relationships?  Who are you?  Oprah?  I can keep a nightcap.  She has this five-day rule before I get invited up.  We like friends without benefits.  She thinks I'm a chef on the rise.  She's going to run when I tell her the truth.  I'm totally screwed.  Come on, what is this?  It's the new read from my book club.  Family for you, Steve Harvey?  You're doing something to bust like that?  This man is a traitor.  They know all of our maneuvers.  This is war, gentlemen. 
[01:40:00]  We use his words to get what we want.  Come on, there he is.  How old is your mom?  What?  I'm not saying it like that.  I am.  I am.  It's like that.  Hey, come on out.  I'm ready for the rest of the tour.  Hey, Kevin.  What's up, buddy?  How are you, man?  Good to see you, Kevin Hart.  Good on time, man.  Good to see you, man.  What's going on, man?  How are you?  All right.  We were just watching the trailer for Think Like a Man.  Yes, you should.  I should be a bitch.  What happened?  You should give me a friendlier greeting than everybody else.  He gives me the same radio handshake. 
[01:40:30]  He gives everybody else this phony.  I felt like it was a real handshake.  No, no, no.  I felt like it was a half a handshake.  I gave Jim what he deserved.  It wasn't hello, Jim.  It was hey, other radio.  Hey, Mike, number three.  Hey, guys, not in the movie.  Oh, that's mean.  Good to see you, Norton.  You too, buddy.  We're watching this.  It's a lot of promotion for Steve Harvey's book.  This was a genius.  Did he write the screenplay for this, or was that just...  No, no, no.  Actually, I should know their names.  Two guys wrote it.  Two very good writers that I really drew a blank on their names wrote it. 
[01:41:00]  But what's good about the movie compared to the book is we didn't want to make it a chick flick.  And that was a meeting that we had.  So they said, well, how do we not make it a chick flick?  So we did it from a male's point of view.  So the movie is actually male-driven.  It's told from a group of guys.  And you literally get to see why we lie, why we cheat, why we manipulate, and why women react the way they react.  So that's the difference.  But the book definitely is what stimulated the movie.  And, you know, that's why we're here now.  That's a massive bestseller, too.  That son of a bitch stayed on the list for a year.  A long time, huh? 
[01:41:30]  Boy, did he sell a lot of books.  He's making tons of money off that book right now.  He really is one of the highest underrated paid comics.  Wow.  As far as his radio show and selling books, he is a fucking bitch guy.  You think he's underrated, though?  I mean, as far as people, when you think top grossing comics.  Right.  Or guys that are making a tremendous amount of money.  People don't always mention Steve Harvey.  He's making a tremendous amount of cash.  It's ridiculous.  His business sense is crazy.  Yeah.  It's irritating.  I just saw you in five-year engagement.  You saw it?  I saw it already.  I haven't seen it.  Was it good?  Yeah, your scenes were real good.  Yes, you were funny. 
[01:42:00]  Can I strike again, Jim?  I know.  It's Jason Segel's movie, and you had a big part in that.  Yeah, yeah.  We've been doing promo.  I've been doing a lot of things like a man promo, so this week I'm doing five-year engagement promo.  But I still haven't seen the movie.  Everybody's been telling me I haven't seen it.  I heard the movie's funny, too.  It's a rom-com.  Okay.  It is a rom-com.  Okay.  But it has a little edge to it.  I didn't mind it.  I didn't mind it at all.  It's not annoying at all to drive down Broadway and see you on a giant fucking movie poster. 
[01:42:30]  Every morning, it's 545 on my way to do radio.  And I get to see you on a giant poster at Times Square.  I'm happy for you.  Does that bother you a little bit, Jimmy?  I just want to be turning the corner.  I want to just see the sign fall off the building.  And crush your car.  Yeah.  That would be perfect.  Yeah.  I'm happy because I can see Jim's face looking at him.  Snarling.  Every morning. 
[01:43:00]  Honking for no reason at my sign.  I'm happy we're – no, it's fun to watch your friends.  I remember one time years ago.  When was it we went around, me, you, Keith, and somebody else?  It was after Soul Plane, and Keith was asking people if they recognized Kevin.  Now they all would.  But back then, you're like, do you know this dummy?  And people look at him.  No, I don't know him.  No, no, no.  You ain't shit.  You're nothing.  You're not making it.  You think you're making it.  You're nothing.  Nobody knows.  You're stupid.  Keith just – he texted me yesterday. 
[01:43:30]  Let me tell you how awful Keith is.  You don't have to.  He texted me yesterday.  He goes, hey, stupid.  My son wants you to follow him on Twitter.  I said, tell your son to go fuck him.  And you know, dummy, here's what happened.  The kid said, I love Kevin Hart.  Like, I'll get him to follow you.  Like, he probably just offered that.  You can't follow him now.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it.  That's great.  Yeah.  That's great.  He thought it was a no-brainer.  No, it's not going to happen.  Look, I told his son to go fuck him.  His son is 15. 
[01:44:00]  All you guys have such a weird relationship.  It's evil.  It's evil.  It's evil.  How do you handle that?  But there's such a genuine side to it as well.  Yeah.  Like, I was just in Boston.  I never see that side of it.  There is.  Listen, I'm going to tell you what I just did.  Here's the genuine side.  I was just in Boston.  Patrice's mom was there.  Took Patrice's mom to the show.  Went to her house for Easter dinner.  Literally, a bunch of old Patrice faces were all around. 
[01:44:30]  It got a little weird.  That's funny.  I just saw a bunch of female Patrice's just around.  But that's what I mean when I say the genuine side.  Even though I'm still the jerk and we still trash each other, that's the genuine side.  You get to see it.  Right.  And if Keith was here, he could also help say, look what Dumbbell just did.  He said, look at this.  While I was in Boston, I made an appearance.  It's like a bad movie thing.  He pulled up in a limousine and got out.  I did.  Give him back.  Give him back.  Give him back.  It was an SUV limo. 
[01:45:00]  Of course it was.  I pulled up.  Of course you did.  I had my security outside.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's fucking classic.  That's pretty true, Jim.  Of course it is.  You don't look at yourself until people show you.  Yeah, you are a pompous ass.  But it is.  They are.  The friendships are real, though.  I mean, it really is.  Oh, my God.  You know, it's like.  Jesus, Jim, you're really getting gray.  I know I am.  That's why I keep the hair short.  Oh, God.  But at least you're not telling me I'm fat.  No, no.  That's what the last time you walked in, the first thing you killed is your face is getting 
[01:45:30]  fat, and I'm fucking Weight Watchers.  No, no, no.  You look good.  Thanks, guys.  Weight Watchers, you look good.  I won't.  I'm definitely not going to say that.  Thank you.  I hit you with the fat card a lot, but you look good.  Thank you.  You look good.  Your hair is great, but you look good.  The hair is getting gray, and I will accept that.  Jobble through that.  That's right.  And your little mole is growing.  It's growing.  It is growing.  They call it hating.  It is growing.  Every fucking photo shoot.  No, no, no.  Shoot me from the right.  Shoot me from the right.  Oh, my God. 
[01:46:00]  You might have to get that checked out.  I refuse.  I refuse to get it taken off.  Oh, whatever it is, I hope it's bad news.  I'm telling you.  See fucking Kevin and Roger Ebert commiserating over instant messaging.  Holy shit.  You're telling me what's wrong with you guys.  Fuck.  Holy fuck.  All right.  I guess we sold the movie.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's how you sell it right there.  I don't know.  That's what people want to hear.  Yeah.  You're funny in movies, man.  And it's like I saw you.  I went and watched your interview with Leno when you brought Shaquille O'Neal out. 
[01:46:30]  That was fucking great.  Because we had him and watched.  He's a great guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We liked him a lot.  Really cool.  It was a little quiet, you know, and you made that really funny.  That was very cool.  His thing, Shaq wants to be a comedian.  He wants to be funny.  Oh, yeah.  He told us many times that he was funny.  He said that many times.  He's got a personality.  But his thing is, like, you know, how do I show people, like, I'm funny.  Like, everybody thinks I'm the big guy.  Yeah.  He wants to be funny.  So, those moments where you say, Shaq, come on, we're going to do something. 
[01:47:00]  And this is when you fall.  Like, he's like, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  What else do you want me to do?  He wants to be that guy.  And he is.  He is funny.  But he just has to be around his environment to be funny.  He's not comfortable enough.  When he first sat down here, when he came in, the first thing he said is, like, nobody  really knows how funny I am.  You're like, really?  All right.  All right.  Let's explore that.  Yeah.  So, tell us something.  He's got nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just like, you know.  But you could tell, like, he's smirking and shit and doing some stuff and being sarcastic. 
[01:47:30]  You could tell he wants to be funny really bad.  He's so down to earth, man.  Yeah.  He's a nice dude.  I didn't expect that.  I just didn't.  How many pitches did Norton take with Shaq?  Oh, my God.  Which is when I took one photo.  It's the one where he's cradling you like a baby.  Yes.  There's one where he's grabbing me.  It's a really good picture.  And I had him sign a ball.  But I had him sign it to me.  I'm not going to sell it.  I'll just put it next to mine.  Norton pulls a camera out like a gun.  I've never seen it.  I'm not like, you don't know what's on him. 
[01:48:00]  It's the quickest day I've ever seen.  Yeah.  You want to real quick?  All right.  Just a quick one.  I will get them.  As long as they're not eating or with their kids.  Then I don't bother people.  But a humiliating moment just to show you where everybody is is when LeBron James came to the comedy cellar.  And I didn't know like Dwayne Wade and a bunch of guys were with him.  It was most of the Miami fucking starting five.  And I had to text Kevin.  And go look.  I kind of want a picture with LeBron.  It's impossible.  Oh, Kevin got that done?  Of course.  I didn't know that.  I had texted LeBron James and said, my friend is there. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, damn.  I said, my awful unattractive friend Norton is going to come up to you.  But that's the genuine thing right there.  Not only is it genuine, but it's my fucking, it's on my phone.  My picture with LeBron.  And I told him, I said, hey, make sure you take a picture with him.  He said, I got you.  Look for a scallop with gray hair.  That's all I said.  That's all I said.  You're going to know who he is.  He's the most unattractive white male that you're going to see.  He looks sick, but he's not.  He's very healthy.  And he's healthy.  Just make sure you show us some love.  So LeBron walked by, and I'm like, hi, I texted Kevin. 
[01:49:00]  And then he just walked another few feet, and he stopped.  But I didn't think he wanted to take it, so I wasn't going to bother him again.  And he goes, do you want to take it?  I'm like, oh, okay.  He really did talk to Kevin.  That's fucking cool.  Yeah, and he was very.  I'm huge, Jim.  I'm a big deal.  Yeah, really, really.  Kevin is a big deal.  It made me happy that I.  Kevin was a good guy, because if it was me, I would have ignored the text.  Oh, shit.  I got you a text the next day.  You prick.  You know that phony thing you're doing?  You don't answer a text.  I got it.  Damn it.  Shit.  I wish I could have.  Damn.  I would have saw it. 
[01:49:30]  If I would have seen that, I would have.  Should I show Kevin the Jim Norton cutout?  He's got a cutout now, Kevin Norton.  Well, if I'm away.  And a celebrity is here.  Can we get that really fast?  Are you serious?  Of course.  I travel a lot.  Who did a cutout of you?  Why do they do it?  Well, it's just they figured if I'm gone and somebody wants to take a picture with me.  Yeah.  They take it with the cutout.  They take it with the cutout.  That's smart.  Yeah, that's smart.  Let me see it.  Isn't it brilliant?  Is it skinny Jim or is this big Jim?  I'd say it's in between.  It wasn't done right.  It's a little too big.  It's a little too big.  His head's a little too big.  Let me see it.  Let me see the cutout.  He looks like he's six foot tall in the cutout. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, it's kind of shitty and creepy.  I definitely need to see it.  I love how this guy just walks down the hall.  I know.  No rush.  How's Eddie Murphy?  I heard that you guys work together.  Man, Eddie's cool, man.  Eddie's cool.  You know, I don't...  That's...  Jim, are you wearing the same outfit that you have on the cutout?  No, I have on it.  You're wearing that sweater.  That's the sweater and a shirt that you have on the cutout.  First of all, I have more than one t-shirt, and that happens to be a black sweater. 
[01:50:30]  It's just not the same black sweater.  No, it probably is.  The way it works is whatever I wear the night before, I'll usually wear it to the radio show.  I'm not going to put on fresh clothes for the radio show, but the pants are different,  as you can see.  Oh, the pants are different.  Those have the, I'm edgy rips.  And this is a more concern.  That just shows people that I'm young and hard.  Edgy rips.  Yeah, I have the fucking ripped jeans looks in the fucking early 90s.  Yeah, that's fantastic.  Fucking...  I'm a complete zero.  There's the Norton cutout, though.  Yeah, that's good.  I'm going to take a picture of the Norton cutout.  Yeah, you should.  You look good in that one, too, Norton. 
[01:51:00]  Thank you.  That's not fat, Norton.  The problem is the neck always looks fat.  Like, I have to have some lipo done on my neck.  It's not really a neck.  It's that space between your chin.  And it's like, it's just that weird fat space.  Yeah.  Fat space.  And I can't get rid of it.  It's the under jaw.  You got the thing that shakes under you.  It's like a turkey gives you.  I can't get rid of it.  The turkey neck.  Yeah, that's what it's like.  It's like that turkey thing.  I'm a good actor.  I'm not...  Well...  Just saying, in case you produce a film,  I'm just throwing that out there.  I can fucking do a good job.  You can do it.  You can do it.  What? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  That's my inquisitive look.  What?  What?  When was the first time you guys met?  I met Norton through Keith Robinson  when I first came up to New York.  They were at a table at the Comedy Cellar.  So, I met Norton.  He didn't really meet me back.  He just gave me the ass.  Oh, really?  He was an asshole.  Were you an asshole, Jimmy?  No, I like Kevin.  Kevin was funny.  Like, a lot of guys came up that, like...  And then he was just a funny guy, man.  It's like...  It's kind of what's that?  96, 97?  Something like that?  And you immediately knew he was a funny guy 
[01:52:00]  because he was just...  You know, it was like everybody else.  Just sitting at the table,  just fucking bashing each other.  That's what we do.  And a lot of guys will get bashed and not come back.  And anyone that travels from...  The great part of watching Kevin do so well  is the better he does,  the fucking unhappier it has to make Keith.  So, that's how...  We don't look...  That's the pleasure you take out of it.  It's fucking...  No one roots for Kevin harder than Keith's friends.  Did Keith bring...  Keith brought you to New York for the first time?  Yeah, Keith brought me to New York.  I'm going to tell you,  you know a good Norton moment for me, though? 
[01:52:30]  This is when I knew, like,  that Norton was just a...  You know, there was some success  that was going on,  especially financially.  Remember when I came to your apartment?  I forgot why.  I forgot why I was there.  You had the place in New York  and it was in a...  It was in a building,  but, like, it was small,  but, like, this was your place.  43rd Street.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With that huge window.  And I get in there,  but just the fact, like, you know,  he had all this stuff going on.  Norton had the computers  and his flat-screen TV.  And I was like, 
[01:53:00]  you never told me  you had all this stuff.  Like, what are you...  And he goes,  yeah, I'm doing well, son.  And he texted me on the back.  Oh, no.  He's like,  I'm doing well.  You know, I'm out here.  Did I tell you I'm on shows?  Like, who are you talking about?  Was it...  Probably Dice at that time.  Yeah, yeah, Dice.  Shows.  We got...  He had so much stuff going on,  but I was like,  yo, it's going to happen.  Like, Norton's making money.  You know,  it's not like he's out  and he's bragging about it,  but he's had this for a while.  This could happen, man.  I just got to...  I just got to keep pushing.  It was like the... 
[01:53:30]  It was the small pieces  of motivation  that you would get  from where people...  But I'll never forget that.  Like, he's like,  I'm doing well, son.  He's like, you know,  I got the radio.  I got Dice.  I think I'm sold out.  Doing well, son.  I'm just serious.  Gave me the small pat on the back  like a young guy.  And I was like,  I need to get it together.  It was motivation, Jimmy.  It's good.  But the real thought was,  if this fucking zilch  can have a decent apartment,  I'm going to live in Bel Air.  And he was right.  If this fucking moderately talented,  ugly fucking cracker  can have a decent apartment,  I'm going to be in 30 films 
[01:54:00]  in two years.  Oh, God.  Yeah, my fucking furnishings  were awful in that apartment, too.  No, it was...  Dude, you...  I can honestly say, though,  between Jim...  I'd say Jim and...  Who else can I say  probably would get...  Bobby.  Bobby would give you  glimpses of positivity.  Everybody else would just mean  all the time.  But I've had some conversations  with Jim in the past  that were really good.  Like, hey, man,  you know,  you're doing the right thing.  And, hey, you're getting funny  just regardless of what's going on.  Don't stop. 
[01:54:30]  Keep writing.  You know, always improve.  So I got glimpses  of greatness from Jim  at certain points,  which was always good.  And you said Bobby,  as in Bob Kelly.  Well, Bobby is the thing,  but Bobby's self-esteem  is so low.  Oh, God, is it?  It's the low, listen.  Bobby's self-esteem  is so low.  So even when you're playing  and you're being mean,  like if you're teasing people,  you can always glimpse  and look at Bobby  and you'll kind of see him  thinking about  what you just said.  Like, if you're like,  Bobby, shut up, fat boy. 
[01:55:00]  Like, you'll literally see him  just curl up for a second  and think about his life  for two seconds  and then give you  that uncomfortable laugh.  Like, he's not really  enjoying it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because he knows  it's kind of true.  Bob knows he's a fat zilcher.  Oh, poor Bob.  You know what, dude?  This is a call you get right now.  Go fuck yourself.  Like that one time.  Shut up, Bob.  Just chill.  Relax.  He tries to make up  with it.  With gadgets.  With gadgets and stuff.  And little things.  With that fucking bandolier. 
[01:55:30]  Have you seen  the bandolier he's wearing now?  It's the dumbest fucking thing.  It literally is like  what Chewbacca wears.  Bob has a fat man's purse.  It wraps around him like,  you ever see  Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  the way they wore the fucking bullet?  Yeah, it's a bandolier.  And he would have,  he puts his wallet in one,  his phone in the other.  And it's got pockets in it  and things.  And so he doesn't have  to go into his pocket.  Like, dude, this is the best.  You're at the airport.  Boom, you put it in the tray.  You're going.  He goes, look, I got my water.  Ask me for my phone.  Oh, Bobby, where's your phone?  Boom, it's right here.  Oh, he just needs  to fill his life up 
[01:56:00]  with things and gadgets  and that way he can have  conversations with people  that aren't just shitting on him.  He sent me,  Bobby sent me a text  on my billboard.  I was doing a theater  in Boston.  So he sends me a text  on my billboard blowing up.  I don't know how.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that.  That's a funny app.  I have no idea.  Oh, that's funny.  From his hotel room, he did it.  He sent me a text.  He said, let me tell you something.  I'm tired of seeing your face  in my city.  If it was up to me,  this is what would happen.  And he sends me the text 
[01:56:30]  and there's a missile  hitting my billboard  blowing up.  That's good.  Wow, that's a good way  to get that.  It really was funny.  I saw that.  I remember we did a gig.  We were fucking working  at college.  I don't remember where it was,  but Kevin was enjoying Metallica.  I remember we were coming back  and listening to fucking Metallica.  I was in the car.  And then my fucking  cassette thing jammed.  My stupid piece of shit Saturn.  Cassette player jammed?  He was introducing me  to rock and roll.  Matter of fact,  Jim is the first person  to actually introduce me  to a bunch of rock and roll.  Really?  I had no choice  because he was driving. 
[01:57:00]  So I had to deal with it,  but I actually found myself  liking the couple.  Got a little weird  at some point.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Jimmy's got a very  eclectic taste in music.  He'll go from your  mainstream hit rock  to some weird  fucking out there shit.  Just weird.  But once you understand  that that's who he is,  then you're fine.  I was like,  okay, I get it.  Johnny Cash.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of  Johnny Cash.  That's what I hate.  I hate the confident.  But a man who has  eclectic taste 
[01:57:30]  likes good things.  You know who likes  Johnny Cash?  Marina Franklin.  Here we go.  Marina Franklin.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  She's another comedian.  She's funny, man.  I was trying to know  a black person  that likes  Johnny Cash  and Marina  is the only one I know.  Bad with it, huh?  The only one.  It begins and ends  with her.  She's the only person.  I think I've heard  two Johnny Cash songs  in my life.  Yeah.  Did you really,  I mean,  I know you for a long time  and we have to ask  because it's here.  Did you really go through,  where's your ass  asking for $90,000 a month?  Of course you would.  Oh, my Christ.  Not a pony.  Of course. 
[01:58:00]  Holy cow.  That's what they do.  See, but here's the difference.  See, here's the difference.  Are you the guy  that gets mad at that  or are you the guy  that says,  you know what,  if that's what you feel  like you should ask for  then go through  the process that you do.  Regardless,  you're still the mother of my kids.  I still love you.  I'm still going to be there  for my kids,  but that's what you do.  You can't control it.  There's nothing you can do.  They can do that forever.  They can go back  and ask for whatever number  that comes up in their head.  That's if you've got kids.  Yeah, but they can do  whatever they want.  When I went through mine,  I fucking,  you know,  I had to pay out 
[01:58:30]  a lot of money,  but there was a light  at the end of the tunnel  where it ends  and I never,  ever have to speak  to that fucking woman again.  See, I'm the complete opposite.  See?  I'm the complete opposite.  So you're cool with that  in a weird way.  Do whatever you think  you need to do.  That means you're making  a shitload of money.  Well, his name.  As long as things  are the way it should be,  you know what  someone can get  and what they can't get.  As long as your papers  and your books are right  and where they're supposed to be,  then at the end of the day  you can go and ask  and take all the court time  that you need.  And I'm not going to stop you. 
[01:59:00]  I'm not going to argue with you.  I'm not wasting any  mental energy.  I'm happy.  I'm in a very happy place.  You know what I don't like  about that whole situation  when it happens?  The fact that you're  doling over so much cash  and you're in a career  that there's no fucking guarantees.  So if I'm a broke motherfucker  after a few years,  can I go back and say,  hey, you know what?  Maybe I could get  a few of those bucks back.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Fuck.  It just, there's no fucking...  Because they assume  you're going to make  the same money  for a long time.  There's no justice there. 
[01:59:30]  It's not a fair arrangement.  No, no, no.  But like I said,  you can't control it.  So why waste...  That's true.  Why waste energy over it?  You know what?  I love how you philosophize it.  That means...  Because I just sat there  for probably a good five years  just being an angry motherfucker  about it.  That's one thing I refuse to do.  Oh, it's terrible.  I refuse to do it.  When I say I am happy,  and I'm not even talking  about the business.  I'm not even talking  about entertainment  or movies.  No, I'm talking about  as a person. 
[02:00:00]  I'm happy.  As a father, I'm happy.  My circle is solid.  I'm not crazy.  You know, yeah, yeah.  I'm in a good place.  That's very healthy and good.  It takes a lot  to move me right now.  It took a while,  but like Andy Dufresne,  I emerged from the shit pipe  and threw my arms up  into the rain,  and I was free.  That's after you did taxes  and were fucked in the ass  by a bunch of other prisoners.  I'm also like Andy Dufresne.  I'd like to say  the Internal Revenue Service  didn't get to him.  Yeah, well... 
[02:00:30]  That's why I am with it.  That's why I am.  But, hey,  I can go so much deeper  than that of more court shit.  It's just...  You can't stop it.  The only annoying part  is like legal...  I've had some legal stuff, too,  and it's just frustrating  to have to pay legal fees.  It's like the lawyers,  even your own lawyers  in any situation,  they never try to make it easier.  No, it's the lawyer's job  to keep it going.  Lawyers work together.  Let it ride.  It takes a dumb person  to not understand that  or realize that.  So as an intelligent person,  you understand the system.  As a lawyer,  it's my job 
[02:01:00]  to keep this going.  Yep.  As her lawyer  or your lawyer,  whatever,  it's our job  to continue conflict.  We're billing per hour.  Pretty much.  For 10 minutes.  Because the two lawyers  don't hate each other.  It's usually the people  who are quarreling  who even have the issues.  So the lawyers,  they both understand each other  in a way that the couple doesn't.  They've got to wink  every so often.  They're looking at each other  and they see how much money  they're going to make.  We've got a good couple here.  We're going to put an addition  on that house.  They go jackpot.  Send the kid to college.  Yeah, yeah.  Jackpot.  Oh, we've got to go. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, this is going to go  for seven years.  This is good.  The jackpot divorce is here.  Like you meet the jackpots there.  Both lawyers applaud  when you guys walk  in the courtroom  and they come.  But it is what it is.  Sometimes it's easier  that people don't hate each other  because you're not going to be as...  But the lawyer will feed that.  If both people are like,  you know what,  we're kind of okay with that,  the lawyer will go,  you know,  and that's all they need.  My job is this.  As long as my kids  aren't being affected, 
[02:02:00]  I have no problem  with what's going on.  As long as,  as a parent,  you're doing what you're supposed to do  and I'm doing what I'm supposed to do  and we maintain that relationship  to where my kids can see it,  I'm happy.  But if it ever...  That's why I say  I can't let it get to me  because if I do allow it  to get to me,  then I'm the person  that's around my kids  and now I'm the guy  to shut up, woman,  and I turn to the crazy guy.  I don't want to be that guy.  So I choose not to address  whatever goes on  in the courtroom.  I don't even talk to her about it.  I don't even talk to her about it. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, really?  I've never had a conversation.  Just whenever it happens  in the courtroom  and never outside.  I promise you that.  Wow, you've never had  to bite your lip.  I've never had a conversation about it.  You would think that I don't know  anything that's going on.  Have you wanted to say something?  I will never address it.  That's a better way  to go through something like that.  How's everything?  Well, you have to deal with it too  because you have kids together  so you're always going to be  a part of your life  so it's probably smarter.  It's much smarter.  How old are the kids?  Seven and four?  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, you can't be that guy  at that age.  I got 18 years of it. 
[02:03:00]  You'll bend their mind.  I have 18 years of it.  So if I start out now  and there's any angry bone  in my body  it's going to last  for 18 years.  You remember that shit  as a kid.  You grow up and go like  oh fuck, I remember  when he was yelling.  They don't see any of it.  I call him and have his guy.  Hey, what's going on?  Everybody fine?  Where's your mom?  Let me talk to her.  That's good.  Where are the kids?  Hey, how y'all doing?  I'll be there in a little bit.  Y'all need anything?  I'm going to bring some food.  Anybody hungry?  Nike sent me some products.  I'm going to bring it by you guys.  That's too nice. 
[02:03:30]  That's killing my kindness, man.  I refuse to go the other route.  He gets good Nike stuff.  That's what I learned.  Kevin's got to do TV.  And Kevin's a good guy, man.  He hooked Keith Robinson up.  Keith showed me what you gave him.  That was nice, man.  Hopefully AIDS.  Yes.  And a new pair of glasses  and a fucking wine habit.  What a drunk Keith  has turned it into.  I'm going to give you  the funniest Keith Robinson story  ever.  Okay, I don't even know.  He's probably going to punch me  in the stomach, I'll tell you this. 
[02:04:00]  But it's that funny, all right?  Keith is cussing me out  about my business managers.  He's like, stupid.  What are you doing?  Like, listen.  What are you doing with your money?  Hmm?  What are you doing?  Are people signing checks for you?  I'm like, no.  Nobody's signing checks for me.  Are you doing what you're  supposed to do?  Yes.  Let me tell you something, stupid.  Okay?  You make sure  you got your books handled.  Don't let anybody else  control your money.  Okay?  And I'm telling you that.  All right?  All right.  No, Keith, I'm serious.  All right.  But I'm not like,  I'm doing well financially. 
[02:04:30]  I'm smart.  All right.  Well, don't make me  ask you again, little dummy,  because I'm telling you  for a reason.  Okay?  The next day, Keith calls me.  They got me.  What?  What?  What are you talking about?  The IRS, stupid.  They're talking some things. 
[02:05:00]  It's cool, though.  I'm going to get them.  I'm going to get them,  but they're...  They got me.  He talked about them  like they were a gang.  They got me, stupid.  Don't worry.  I'm on it, though.  I'm going to get them.  But he just tortured me  and rammed me about stuff.  What a dunce.  Oh, is that fucking good?  That's classic.  He's schooling you.  Hey, dummy.  IRS attacked him. 
[02:05:30]  He gave me the best advice ever.  This is the story  I was hoping for,  and it hasn't happened yet,  because Kevin has to go  on STV.  We're promoting  Think Like a Man.  There's posters for it  all over,  and the trail looks funny,  and you're a funny fuck, man.  Thank you, son.  And your stuff is good.  You hate to admit that  to your friend,  but Kevin's a really...  You're pained saying that.  No, but Kevin's  a really great comic, too.  It's like you can't not...  Patrice said that about you, too.  We were talking,  about something,  and Patrice didn't hand out  a lot of stand-up compliments,  but whatever the special was 
[02:06:00]  that was at the time,  he's like,  it's funny, man.  It's really funny.  Yeah, like,  he genuinely respected your stand-up.  The conversation I'm waiting for  is fucking Keith  and you in the car,  where he's like,  look, man,  I just need some help.  And the tears.  I'm waiting for Keith  to ask for some help,  and the tears to come down.  That hasn't happened yet,  but it will.  Within five years,  you'll have that conversation  with him.  No matter what, though,  Keith,  our relationship is so close,  and I put him through so much. 
[02:06:30]  People have no idea  the stuff that I've done.  Really?  I pissed in Keith's car,  like,  in his seat,  in the passenger seat,  drunk on my 21st birthday.  You remember that?  Yes, I do.  Fell asleep,  21st birthday.  I pissed in the passenger seat  of his car.  Didn't tell him.  Just got up.  I woke up.  I was like,  oh, shit.  I just pissed.  I just got out of his car.  Oh, man.  He called me the next morning.  Stupid!  You're going to clear it!  You think you're not going to clear it yet?  You're going to get a detail. 
[02:07:00]  I pissed at his car good.  I've done so much, man.  Ruined his relationships.  Lied.  Oh, I put him through so much.  You have no idea, man.  Like, that guy there,  I'm loyal to Keith for a reason.  Yeah.  He's done a lot for me, man.  Yeah, that's cool.  He gave Keith a very nice gift.  He loved that ugly son of a bitch.  Because he told me.  He gets a truck from Ford  for doing a commercial.  And he fucking...  And Keith was talking shit.  This is how dumb Keith  is.  He was going out to L.A.  And he's like, ah!  And, uh...  No, you're fine. 
[02:07:30]  You're fine.  I wanted to make sure  you didn't sign anything  that said you wouldn't.  I still have it.  I actually bought Keith one.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I bought him one.  Oh, you bought him one?  That's fucking cool.  I got a lot of money, Jim.  Roland's making faces over here.  He bought Keith Robinson.  A fucking truck.  That's awesome.  Wow.  Yeah.  Bought Keith Robinson.  There's the genuine again.  Yeah.  We'll leave with the genuine.  He's got to go live with Kelly.  Kevin Hart for real.  Number four on...  Like, number four, 
[02:08:00]  not the word four.  Kevin Hart for real on Twitter.  And I think like a man  is in theaters Friday.  And it's got a good cast.  Jerry Ferrari.  You're friends with Chris Brown.  Mm-hmm.  And Wendy Williams.  So it's obviously a good cast.  And good luck, man.  Well, happy to see you.  Great seeing you again, man.  I always love coming here, dude.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  I'll see you guys again.  Jim, lay you.  Oh, man.  Unattractive son of a bitch.  I'll see you later.  Kevin Hart, everyone.  This is the Opie and HL on SiriusXM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs. 
[02:08:30]  FU to me for my limited news exposure.  Because any time I say a quote  or say that I heard something 
[02:09:00]  and it's topical  and it's informative  and they say,  oh, where'd you get that from?  I say the ONA show  and I look like a complete buffoon.  So, fuck you guys.  Fuck you.  Hey, Chip.  Just wanted to call in  and say thank you.  Watching the message  and I've had to say,  what's that?  5,000 fucking times.  F you.  Fuck you.  Um, yeah.  This is you.  This is Valley Gym.  Valley Gym.  You fucking shot.  Fuck your fucking grody comments. 
[02:09:30]  Give me the douche shows.  Fuck you, Valley Gym.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this message is for little Jimmy Norton.  Thanks for creating the Uncle Paul character.  Now every time my kid nephews  call me Uncle Paul,  I feel like a fucking creep.  So, fuck you, Jim Norton.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM. 
[02:10:00]  And now,  the Opie and Anthony Show.  Kevin Hart.  He's all right.  I love Kevin.  Yeah, he's very, very cool.  Think like a man in theaters Friday.  And he really is a good actor.  It's like with me and Oprah talking in the break  about like your friends making it 
[02:10:30]  and doing really well.  And he's a dude that like, honestly,  he's a really good actor.  He looks great on camera.  He's a funny stand-up.  He's obviously a charismatic, funny dude.  So it's like you don't begrudge a guy like that  when he's doing really well  because I understand why people like him.  You were telling me he could do 10,000 seats.  Oh, yeah.  Kevin can sell 10,000 seats.  Kevin can do a fucking...  He might be up to even larger in certain markets.  He might be able to do an actual arena.  But you don't begrudge a guy like that 
[02:11:00]  because he is actually really good.  Comics don't like it when shitty comics make it.  Not many arena guys.  No, there's not.  What's the short list?  Dane Cook.  I don't know if Dane can actually do an arena right now  or maybe like 7,000 or 8,000,  which, again, I'm not taking anything away.  The guys are...  The big ones right now,  I don't know if Louie can do an arena,  but he can do a lot.  Pretty close, right?  Louie is fucking massive.  Kevin...  Russell Peters.  Chelsea Handler is one of the biggest-selling comics.  Yeah, Russell Peters.  There's a short list of guys.  Ron White. 
[02:11:30]  Ron White.  I don't know if Ron can do 10,000 seats right now.  That's a lot.  Gaffigan can sell a few.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  CNN.  We're looking at John Cusack.  The Raven showcases Poe's works.  It sure does.  We're going to have John Cusack in a few minutes here.  It says Cusack on Egg Round Poe,  and then it says, quote,  he's the godfather of goth.  Do you think he's going to say that?  How much do you want to bet?  Do you want to bet?  I bet he says that.  Let's bet.  Do you want to bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet?  Let's just make it like 20 bucks. 
[02:12:00]  I bet 20 bucks he says he's the godfather of goth  at some point during the interview.  I want to try to screw him up,  and I'm going to say something that sounds like that,  but not that first.  What do you...  No!  Like, he's the uncle of modern-day sadness movements.  But then you go, well, he's the godfather of goth.  More importantly, you're ripping off Groucho Marx.  Hoo-hoo.  Oh, the secret word?  The secret word.  Say the secret word.  The bite flies down.  Well, let's start that bit with all our guests.  That's funny.  We'll try to see if they say something out there.  This is the secret phrase. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, secret phrase.  So, godfather of goth.  We're going for that today?  I think...  Because that sounds like a catchphrase  that they would want to get out there for the movie.  Sure.  Like, oh, godfather of goth.  Let's make Edgar Allan Poe cool.  And, uh, yeah.  They are...  Really quick.  They are showing, like, an actual scene from The Raven on CNN right now.  Yeah.  Yeah, my copy was absolutely darker than this.  Oh, really?  Way darker.  Yeah, they probably...  Wow, this looks really...  Just screw with ya.  The cinematography looks great in that scene. 
[02:13:00]  I didn't...  I didn't...  They gave me kind of a lame copy.  They didn't want me to fucking, you know, dupe it and sell copies.  The fact they just gave me one copy is so irritating.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  You know, I fucking...  When's it out?  Cusack was exhausted playing Poe.  For Friday.  Why would he be exhausted playing a guy?  Well, it's very...  You have to get into the character?  Yeah, you got to get into the character.  Edgar Allan Poe is very macabre-y.  What do we know about that guy?  He was a drunk, I think.  Oh, was he? 
[02:13:30]  I think he drank a lot.  They show that in the movie.  Sounds fun.  Not you, Eddie.  What else?  Did he die early?  How old was Edgar Allan Poe when he died?  I'm going to say 67.  What year was it?  1850.  Jimmy.  1849.  Oh, damn.  Jimmy knows it's Edgar Allan Poe.  What's that?  And he was 40.  Should.  40.  But I think he stopped writing, right?  Didn't he do most of his shit really early on and then said, fuck it?  Oh.  I don't know either.  I just threw that out there. 
[02:14:00]  Let's see if that's right.  Poe died destitute despite his fame.  He died destitute.  He died in 1849?  That's right.  1849.  Wow.  What do you mean he died destitute?  What does that mean?  Thank God he didn't have to.  Like homeless and shit?  No money.  You know.  No money.  I picked up a few destitutes.  Thank God for him.  He didn't have to see what happened in 16 years.  You know.  Not a slave's thing.  What?  Was that really 1849?  It's amazing how famous his books are. 
[02:14:30]  It's funny.  He was born 200 years ago.  Did you read Edgar Allan Poe?  That was crazy.  I think I tried.  We had to in school.  What did we have to learn?  The telltale hat.  The telltale hat.  The hat and the pendulum.  He liked absinthe.  Is that what I'm seeing there?  The ravine.  I don't know if that's true.  Can I tell you the end of the movie? 
[02:15:00]  No.  I want to see it.  No.  Please?  No.  I want to see it.  So he's going to come in and say the godfather of goth.  Who's taking your bet?  I don't know.  Who is that?  I don't take my bet.  Officially.  For the fun.  20 bucks.  I lose every bet.  I suck at a show.  Oh, sweetie.  Don't give yourself such a hard time.  The iPad was a no-brainer.  They went with the same size.  Get the fuck out of here.  And then it comes out they are going to make a mini iPad.  That's just another rumor. 
[02:15:30]  It's not a rumor.  That's where it's all going.  What?  Dude, what if I bait him a little?  Like, is that allowed if I go?  So how would you describe Edgar Allan Poe?  Fair enough.  Yeah, that's fine.  I don't care.  It'll just be fun of me.  I'll lose that 20.  The second he says it, it's just going to be hilarious.  I really don't care.  I don't even care either.  In all fairness, though, just so you know ahead of time, I am baroque.  Oh, jeez.  So I'll have to give it to you tomorrow.  And I usually carry more cash around these days.  That's fine.  We'll be gentlemen.  I'm a gentleman. 
[02:16:00]  That's funny.  Knows a lot about Edgar Allan Poe.  You know what?  We could do our fucking show prep live right now for everybody.  Yeah?  Why don't we do this?  Okay.  Tom in Harrisburg.  Tom.  Hey, that Tom.  How you doing, buddy?  You're out, Tom.  Yeah, I've performed Poe's work for about 15 or 20 years.  So if you want to know virtually anything about him, go ahead and fire away.  You know what?  Oosh.  I think we could impress John Cusack if we know a little bit about this guy.  So give us just basic, quick shit about Edgar Allan Poe.  Yeah.  We're talking like cliff notes here. 
[02:16:30]  Cliff notes shit.  Well, basically, the reason he wrote all the nasty, horrible stuff that he did was because  virtually everybody he ever loved in his life died way too early of horrifying diseases  and shit.  Why?  That's great info.  Why did that happen?  He just had bad luck?  Yeah.  It's consumption and some cancers.  The consumption.  Yeah.  So, like all of the Mask of the Red Death and all the ones that deal with wasting diseases  and shit like that are a direct result of people dying of tuberculosis and everything else. 
[02:17:00]  Look, my answer would be everyone died that he loved.  I would get that question correct on an exam.  That's good.  His wife, Virginia, was actually his first cousin.  What's that?  First cousin?  Wife?  Yeah.  That means there's some funny Poe's walking around right now.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And on top of that, she was 13 years old when they got married.  Whoa.  Yay!  Can't hold that against the guy.  I sure love Edgar Allen Poe.  Jesus. 
[02:17:30]  Love Edgar.  This was his first wife?  Yeah, it was his only wife, yeah.  She was 13 when they got married.  How old was he?  He was, I think, 26.  You know, those were different times.  That was acceptable.  Like, he died at 40, you know.  It really was.  I mean, it was a smaller world, so the fact that you were...  They understood pubic hair back then.  Oh, man.  Why else would you have pubic hair?  It's like reading the tea leaves.  But why else would you have pubic hair?  We just decided a long time ago that's fucked up.  To tell if they're old enough?  That means you're ready for sex. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Is that how that works?  I don't go there.  I'm just giving you some logic, though.  It's like Logan's run where the thing beeps on your hand.  They just understood.  It's time to fuck.  They understood, man.  And your pubes grow in.  If you got buds and pubic hair, nature's saying, look, what are you waiting for?  And he actually wasn't the drunk that everybody thinks he was.  Oh.  He didn't even take any drugs yet.  The reason everybody thinks that is after he was dead, his personal and professional rival, 
[02:18:30]  a guy named Rufus Griswold actually wrote his biography a couple of weeks after he died.  Oh, man.  And Griswold just lied his fucking ass off.  What a cock.  Wait.  So why?  Thank you.  The guy didn't drink that much?  Well, he was like the classic binge alcoholic where he would go on a bender for a couple  of days once every couple of years.  And it's my theory that he was actually allergic to alcohol.  I am, too.  I get woozy.  I fall down.  I talk all slurred.  That's not an allergy.  It's because you're fucking drinking too much. 
[02:19:00]  Getting fucked up on call 45.  You old bitch, get your son out the room.  Chipper stop jibber jabbering over there.  So, yeah, like one drink would affect him like 10 drinks would.  And he would go on a bender, get really fucked up, and then he would abstain for the next couple  of years.  He was like a binge alcoholic.  Yeah, but most people would think that he was a drunk.  What else?  He would binge.  He was an alcoholic.  Yeah, okay.  And what did he die of?  That's a good one.  That's the mystery.  I tend to think it was a combination of the allergy to alcohol. 
[02:19:30]  I don't give a fuck what you think.  What does history say?  It's a mystery.  All we know is that he was found in a ditch in Washington wearing somebody else's clothes.  And three days later, he was dead in a hospital.  But what he actually died of is a total mystery.  And I like to say he would like that.  His teeth were dry.  No, it wasn't from dry teeth, Edgar.  He didn't die from dry teeth.  He couldn't take medicine.  No, no.  But was there any signs of foul play? 
[02:20:00]  Oh, foul play.  Was his death macabre?  I hate that.  Were there signs of foul play?  Well, one of the strange theories is that it's a thing called cooping, which is a form of voter fraud, where back in the day you could take a drunk, have him go into the voting polling place, have him vote once, take him across town to another voting place, put him in a different set of clothes, and send him in and vote early.  So Obama got elected. 
[02:20:30]  I know.  Yeah, exactly.  Acorn was working back then, too.  But, yeah, so they think because he was what they call worse for the wear and sort of incoherent and drugged up, yeah, they think that that might have been a form of voter fraud, and he might have succumbed from whatever treatment he had gotten the night before.  Mysterious death I'm going to write down.  See?  I'm cramming, man.  All right.  And finally, one Edgar Allan Poe tidbit that will blow John Cusack away.  Just one, one fucking thing. 
[02:21:00]  Didn't have dried tea.  One thing.  He wrote all sorts of stories, you know, dealing with premature burial, being buried alive and confined and things like that.  Because he felt guilty for, perhaps he felt guilty for falling in love with and marrying his own first cousin.  In fact, she was much, much younger than him.  So all these things might have come from a guilty conscience.  Nice.  I think we're good.  That's pretty good.  I think we're good for the test. 
[02:21:30]  And he was actually a hell of a lot funnier than people think he was.  He wasn't like the, I mean, he had a wicked sense of humor.  If you actually read all of his shit, he was an incredibly funny guy.  Well, thank you.  Thank you for that.  But I'm asking about Edgar Allan Poe.  Yeah.  His moose bit is hilarious.  He hacks the moose to pieces.  It's great.  Very macabre.  All right, Tom from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  It's Todd, but who gives a shit?  Todd doesn't mind.  Well, you did. 
[02:22:00]  You cared because you corrected us.  Whatever the fuck it is.  Where's John Cusack?  All right, Todd.  Thank you so much, sir.  Are we done with this guy with the Edgar Allan Poe stuff?  Yeah, we're done with him.  All right.  Where's John Cusack?  He's running a little late on his media tour.  The show he's doing before us.  Oh, yeah?  What show is he doing before us?  Howard.  Howard who?  Stern.  Oh, Stern guy.  Oh, wow.  Oh, he found time not to bitch to me.  I wonder what he's talking about.  Probably Edgar Allan Poe.  Any old movies? 
[02:22:30]  Mentioning?  Well, that's...  I like to say anything.  Hoo-hoo.  I don't mind.  There's certain people that you don't want to wait for Howard to finish with before they  come over.  John Cusack, I don't mind.  We don't know John Cusack.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  That's fine.  People we know.  Yeah.  I was doing those reads and I got to fucking...  I got to use the bathroom before John Cusack gets here.  We'll go use the...  So we can break again.  You guys...  You just took one.  Well, when he leaves, it still takes a few minutes. 
[02:23:00]  So we can take another break and then we can go to the end of the show.  Yeah, let's do that.  Please do the single.  Really fast.  Sean has better Edgar Allan Poe tidbits.  That's right.  Why do you have better Edgar Allan Poe tidbits?  Because I'm a literature professor.  That would do it.  You don't like that actor guy?  No, I mean, he's interpreting his shit.  But here's the coolest tidbits.  Edgar Allan Poe was classmates at West Point with Robert E. Lee, who funded his first book 
[02:23:30]  of poetry.  That's pretty fucking cool.  What was his first book?  He funded it.  Oh, funded.  I didn't hear that.  He was classmates at West Point, paid him, gave him money, and he published his first book  of poems called El Arra.  All right.  You know what's fascinating when listeners call and give us information?  Someone will always call to refute that information and call the other guy an idiot that knew  nothing.  I love it.  It's every single time.  All right.  What do you know about Edgar Allan Poe?  Quickly.  I'm going to the bathroom, too. 
[02:24:00]  Come on.  His father walked off when he was about four years old.  He never saw him again.  His mother died of consumption.  He was adopted by the Clems.  And his stepfather, I'm sorry, his adopted father, never would adopt him, which hurt Poe's  feelings his whole life.  Oh, God.  Wait, what happened?  Because Edgar was distracted.  He wants me to go to the bathroom.  But I'm not going to do that.  I'm a professional.  And I'm going to sit here and get more Edgar Allan Poe info for the big John Cusack interview. 
[02:24:30]  So run through this again.  I did not hear the whole four-year-old.  So give me like his bio.  Poe's parents were very well-known actors, right?  And his father disappeared when Poe was about four years old.  His mother died of tuberculosis and left Poe and his brother and his sister orphans.  You hung up on me, didn't you?  Fucking hate this. 
[02:25:00]  Anyway, follow that giant cock.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  The Opie Anthony Channel.  I'm getting sick and tired of everyone making fun of red-haired people.  On Sirius XM.  Oh, he's a ginger.  Oh.  You guys on the air right now?  Are we in the air?  Are we in the air?  You guys on the air right now?  Are we in the air?  I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  Fucking air.  You guys on the air right now?  Are we in the air right now?  Are we actually on the air?  They're not on the air. 
[02:25:30]  Are we actually on the air?  They're not on the air.  Not on the phone.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We do that.  You guys on the air right now?  Are you guys on the air?  Are we in the air right now?  We're on the radio right now.  Are we on radio?  We're on the radio right now.  Are we on radio?  Are we on radio?  Yes, ma'am.  Yes, ma'am.  Yes, ma'am.  Yes, ma'am.  Now we're on. 
[02:26:00]  Series X.  This is the OPNF3 Show.  Show, show, show.  Want to say hi to John?  Oh, he's not here yet?  Oh.  What happened?  What happened?  It's like 12 after.  We got an update there, Sammy?  He's still on the Howard Stern Show.  When he's done, he'll come over.  Yeah.  That happens.  Let's go get our time.  After all, we are the second bananas around here. 
[02:26:30]  I don't care.  I don't mind a guy doing...  I really don't, because he may be a Howard fan for 15 years.  Who knows?  Well, they may have a relationship, but there's certain times where people refuse to do this  show first, where it's like, eh, that's why I'm done with Jonah Hill forever, even though  I like Jonah personally.  I genuinely think he's great, and I mean that.  I would say if I thought he stunk.  Uh-huh.  But I think that we had to say...  Oh, that was the day he did Howard's show and not ours.  But it wouldn't come here at all, and that's what bugged me. 
[02:27:00]  But then he wanted to come back when maybe his movie needed a little more help than Money  Ball.  And no one said, don't do Howard.  No one said, don't...  Literally, if he had said, look, yeah, man, I'll be happy to come over.  I've got to do TV so I can come over for 10, 15 minutes only.  I'd be totally great with that.  Oh, yeah.  And it's nice of you to come by.  It would be wonderful.  But sometimes you've just got to cut ties angrily, and sometimes you've got to do it not angrily.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  We're pretty honest about when we're mad at another person. 
[02:27:30]  I don't feel any anger for him.  Father left when he was four.  I'm cramming for the exams.  I'm ready.  Father left.  So what about Edgar Allan Poe's notoriously dry teeth?  Funded.  It wasn't that Edgar.  Yes, it is.  And who adopted him?  Clems, right?  The Clems.  The Mellon Camps.  What's at the Mellon Camps?  Shut up.  Oh, shit.  He said his older brother, Eugene.  There was no Eugene. 
[02:28:00]  I might have Tom Petty's guitars.  Just want to put that out there.  Why are you shaking your head?  Because they were found.  Oh.  Oh, I don't have his guitars.  Thank God.  Someone gave me some guitars.  I thought they might have been Tom Petty's.  I'd be afraid they had bedbugs in them.  You think he looks like the type of guy that might have bedbugs?  Hello.  Oh.  Just acting.  Damn, that was good.  Oh, shit.  Fooled every motherfucker in the room.  That's right.  Fooled every motherfucker. 
[02:28:30]  Such a dick.  This is a fun show, man.  No, it's not.  I mean, not at this moment.  But, I mean, it's just a silly, fun fucking show.  I should have not cared a long time ago because I really have a good time now.  It's fun, dude.  It's a fun thing.  Why the fuck did I give a shit for so many years?  This is way more, way more fun.  Oh, yeah.  Give the fuck what happens to us.  We should chat with Steve Blatter after.  Oh, we will.  Oh, boy.  Is he going to be talking to us?  Wait, you guys are scheduling a meeting? 
[02:29:00]  That's right.  No way.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  What's that?  Whoa!  Tell Big Ethel you'll talk to her later.  And tell fucking Reggie and Archie that you can't make it.  We need you.  Archie.  Jughead.  I did give Anthony a warning back to the studio.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Put my coffee there.  I told him I'm in one of those moods, and he might have to pull the brim down on his hat.  Pull the brim of my hat down, which I do, and I don't want to make eye contact with anybody in the studio because it's too embarrassing what's going on. 
[02:29:30]  I don't know.  I'm in the air for him today.  He better be on his best behavior.  Are you just going to ask questions?  No, I'm not going to be a dick at all.  Edgar Allen Poe that you already know the answer to to, like, impress him?  Hey, you know, I heard.  I'm going to show some knowledge, but I only attack guests when they deserve it now.  The old days, half the people didn't deserve it.  That's the difference.  Wooden teeth, Edgar Allen Poe.  Oh, I got a better update from Stephen Philly. 
[02:30:00]  Just now, 9.30 a.m.  Yes.  Probably isn't.  Could be.  Howard goes.  At this point, it could be.  Howard goes, oh, John has to leave.  Cusack, no, I don't have to leave.  They continue to talk.  He probably wasn't informed.  But that means Steve's not listening to us.  That's why that always pisses me off.  He's monitoring both shows.  Oh, I hope monitoring both shows.  I hope so.  He's got two ears.  Maybe he's just going back and forth like he's some kind of a volleyball or something. 
[02:30:30]  And this guy goes, Howard is intentionally fucking you guys right now, not letting John leave.  I don't care.  Fine, I don't care.  Yeah.  He gets to eat your yogurt.  He'll be in here.  Yeah, I'm not concerned with John Cusack being late.  I'm sure he'll be here and he'll be chipper with that, and he'll be happy to see us, and he'll be fine.  Plus, you guys got an hour to fill anyway, so it's like.  That's not the way I look at this radio show.  It's not?  No, I say there's an hour of quality entertainment left to give these fucking guys and gals.  Exactly. 
[02:31:00]  I say that all the time.  You guys don't hear because the mics are off, but every time the mics go on after a break,  I'll be like, let's entertain these guys and gals.  It gets to fucking rally.  Troops get rallied.  I've never heard you say that.  Yeah.  If you don't agree with me, you're a communist.  Good point, Uncle Ted.  Uncle Ted.  Good point, Uncle Ted.  Wrap yourself up in the flag.  God bless.  God bless.  You know we're wrong.  You're right we're wrong.  United States of Ted.  That's right.  That's where we live.  You're a patriot.  We're all communist faggots.  Excellent point.  Well said. 
[02:31:30]  I need help from the audience.  That's the world.  We just live in it.  That's right.  That's right.  President Ted in the U.S. of Ted.  There's audio of a cockpit.  This goes back to the summer.  Last summer.  I found sort of part of it yesterday, but it was bad quality.  A pilot.  His mics open, whatever you call those fucking things when they're in the cockpit.  Yeah, Mike.  Mike is radio.  And he was basically talking about how he was banging broads all over the place.  Stewardesses. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, really?  In this city.  And they're wild in Chicago.  And I think there was some gay stuff.  Oh.  Making fun of some of the guys that you see serving you on the plane.  Servicing?  Oh, sorry.  And I guess he didn't realize his mic was on.  And he's in the middle of a flight.  And then all the pilots are basically trying to say, your mic's live.  Your mic's on.  Oh, man.  And then everyone is just listening to this guy just say all his stuff.  And then other pilots had to get involved and tell the tower, look, I just want to let  you know this isn't us. 
[02:32:30]  It's the other guy.  It was a whole fucking thing.  We got it?  You think you got it?  Well, it may be the hate rant if he's talking about gays and stuff.  Oh, it could be.  I didn't hear any hate at all when I was listening to this.  What are you talking about gays?  I was howling.  Oh, I guess some people would find that hate speech, yeah.  I found it really funny.  Let's find out.  I had Tucson Indy all four weeks.  And Chicago Cruise, 11 out of 12. 
[02:33:00]  There's 12 flight attendants, individual, ever the same flight attendant choice.  11 over the top.  Let me find it uncensored.  Why is that censored?  Sam.  Sam.  They weren't broadcasting on regular radio.  Sam.  Leave the curses out.  But that's definitely it.  That's definitely it.  It is.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  So if you can find it uncensored.  Dirty.  This is classic.  I hate that. 
[02:33:30]  Uncensored.  Put the beeps in.  You like them?  Yes, I do.  Where's our Cusack update?  He's still on the air with Howard.  I do.  Right?  I'm not staying late for a Cusack.  I'll tell you right the fuck around.  He's a big star.  I don't care.  Big star.  I don't care.  Things to do.  Mm-hmm.  What do you got going on?  Yeah.  None of your business.  Why wouldn't you just share your lives?  He's busy.  He's getting his teeth moist.  Nobody gets their teeth moist. 
[02:34:00]  What's Howard doing over there?  With him.  Does he run out of things to talk about in the movie?  Now he's just like, you know what I really like?  Lesbian.  Well, he was asking him.  He was running into Robin.  No, what I don't like?  Losing lawsuits.  Oh.  He was running down a list of, did you fuck this girl?  Oh, he's doing that.  Oh, he's doing the did you fuck this girl?  No, he's never done that bit before.  That's weird.  I've heard that one, I think.  You have?  Okay.  Hey, do you want to take this to a vote?  What time do we cancel the John Cusack interview because we have been put out? 
[02:34:30]  Well, I'll give the guy the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah.  To what time?  And give him.  He was scheduled at nine.  He's 20 minutes late.  Nine.  I think 930 is safe.  And he may not know every bit of his schedule.  930.  What about nine?  Like, give him till 945 and then just do 15 minutes with him.  Nope.  Give him till 945.  Nope.  Not in my world.  Half hour late.  I'm not around.  Not.  You still got to be here anyway.  You tell me to meet at Starbucks or something and you're a half hour late. 
[02:35:00]  I am gone, Sam.  Yeah, but you guys still got to stay here.  What?  But if you worked at Starbucks, you wouldn't leave early.  Right.  But that's the beauty of it.  Canceling and then he's all confused outside the studio as we continue to broadcast.  That shows that we have balls.  Like, look, we have a limit of how long we'll wait for you.  Yeah.  I don't like the Sam's our boss bullshit that he pulls out.  If I want to fucking leave right now, I will, Sam.  Somebody's got to produce this goddamn show.  What?  You're not talking to fucking Chip Chipperson here.  What? 
[02:35:30]  You're talking to a guy who almost had a fist fight with a Russian last night.  Right.  What the fuck did you do last night?  I was in a fight yesterday.  No, you weren't.  Oh, shit.  You shouldn't have mentioned me.  Oh, shit.  I was being quiet.  I'm going two out of three votes.  I say 930.  He's talking about smoking pot right now.  You know what?  I'm saying 930, and I'm going to stick to it.  So when he's all awkward outside that studio, we've got to hang in there and be tough.  How about this?  I have Eric write down the questions that Howard's asking him right now.  Can we just ask him the same thing?  And then we just ask him those questions. 
[02:36:00]  That's pretty good.  Are you with me at 930?  Well, now it's just eight minutes.  Tell me the truth.  The movie wasn't even that, you know.  Oh, boy.  You said it was pretty good.  Oh, that's true.  I'm getting some text here saying that enjoy Cusack on the shit show.  Sam Roberts and John Cusack.  Well, we do have a Jimmy picture issue.  Yeah.  You want to get a picture with him? 
[02:36:30]  Well, of course.  I would like to, but I'm not obsessed with it.  No?  I like to.  He's fine.  Sure, I would get one.  He's talking about Woody Harrelson right now.  Cool.  I love Woody Harrelson.  I was watching People vs. Larry Flitt last night.  It's an awesome movie.  Is there any feel that he might be wrapping up?  He is wrapping.  Is the text.  Yeah, it looks like, it sounds like they're wrapping right now.  I rap really good, too.  So now they're going to rap for a while?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, shut up.  I'm the star system.  I'm like the big dipper. 
[02:37:00]  When I drink soda, I'm not a sipper.  How does it finish?  If you want to see a gigantic you-know-what, look behind my zipper.  And then, the last line.  I walk real graceful.  I ain't no tripper.  I thought it was going to be chipper in there.  Was that?  I swim good like I got a pair of flippers.  This is just awful radio.  Chip doing raps.  Wait, is that literally how much time he has? 
[02:37:30]  There's a countdown clock.  What do you mean?  To 9.30.  Oh, I thought that's how much time he actually had to spend with us.  Yeah, the countdown clock is legit.  I just got note.  As they were wrapping up, they fell back into conversation.  You serious?  Yes.  I want 9.30 to hit so bad now.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  How about 9.35?  No, 9.35.  It's going to be uncomfortable.  Because I'd rather play the Southwestern audio, to be honest with you.  Because it's great. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, it's going to be uncomfortable, though.  Any takers for 9.35?  9.30, man.  Wait, how's it going?  9.30, 9.30.  We got a 9.30.  We got a 9.35.  9.35, 9.35, 9.35, 9.35, 9.35, 9.35, 9.35, 9.35, 9.40, 40, 40, 49, 41.  No?  I think we'll have a good time.  Why is it always something good in the locker?  It's like, oh, I think I got a bad locker here.  Oh, but what's the whole gold doubloons?  It's gold doubloons in an old stripper's cowboy boot from Vegas.  Wow, who knew? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, I like that with his t-shirt and hat on that says, yep.  Yep.  I'm saving a 135.  Just give me a 5, 5, 5, 5, 5.  That guy is great.  5 more, 5 more.  1.40, 1.40, 1.40.  That guy is fucking awesome.  Oh, yeah.  I love auctioneers.  It's amazing how an auctioneer can talk so fucking fast.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's like a little...  Wait, wait, wait.  They got like a few catchwords or phrases that these...  Yeah, 5 can even be 5.  Yeah, yeah.  Find an auctioneer on YouTube.  Hang on a second, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You'll probably find fastest auctioneer.  Put in fastest auctioneer. 
[02:39:00]  I bet it's ludicrous how fast that is.  They're wrapping up again.  Oh, again?  Mm-hmm.  John Cusack, thanks for stopping in and screwing over Opie and Eddie.  All right.  What do we got?  Five minutes.  Five minutes, Sam.  Five minutes.  Let's hear a fast auctioneer while we wait.  $1,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $40,000, $35,000, $35,000, $25,000, and now $30,000. 
[02:39:30]  $35,000, $35,000, they lose like $35,000, $35,000, $35,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $35,000, $35,000, $35,000, $35,000, $35,000, $5,000.  $35,000, $35,000, $35,000, $35,000, $35,000, $35,000.  That guy's good.  He is good.  It's not fast.  I mean, it's fast, but not the fastest.  They lose like $35,000, $35,000, $35,000.  Everyone's impression of an auctioneer.  Five, give me five, give me five, 10, 10, 10, 10.  Okay, they're in commercial.  Oh, good.  Oh, that means he's on his way.  I'll be here. 
[02:40:00]  Can we tell we need water for our guest?  Mm-hmm.  A little water would be nice.  Do we have waters?  Sure, I can.  No problem.  Okay.  I want to hear more auctioneer.  It's not here yet.  What happened?  I don't know.  I want to hear the auctioneer.  $100,000.  I got $2,000.  I got a bid at $25,000.  Now $3,000.  I got a bid at $3,000.  I got a bid at $3,000.  I got a bid at $4,000.  I got a bid at $4,000.  I got a bid at $4,000.  I got a bid at $4,000.  I got a bid at $4,000.  That's been sped up. 
[02:40:30]  I don't think so.  Wow, that's cool.  I don't think it's sped up.  No, I think you're right. 
[02:41:00]  That's pretty cool.  Those guys are great.  All right.  That's everyone's impression of an auctioneer.  Yeah, yeah.  The same way.  You always wanted to give me five, give me five, give me five, give me something.  Or something.  Yeah, something.  Give me five, give me two.  I don't know.  I lose my place.  Do you?  Do you?  Yeah, sure.  What time is it?  Three minutes.  Uh-oh. 
[02:41:30]  Two and a half.  Any good shots?  Oh, boy.  Here it comes.  A little late.  No, he's done with that show.  He's got to probably use the bathroom or something.  Calm his hair a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know.  Get all revamped here.  Godfather Goth.  That's what I'm looking for.  20 bucks.  Shit.  Yeah, I need a 20, 20, 20, 20, 20.  I forgot about that part.  Try to.  Give him a 20.  And then. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, I saw it.  I do enjoy a good, fast auctioneer.  Do you?  Yeah.  They're amazing.  I'd love to hear one of them.  Oh, Sam Roberts running.  Yes, Sam?  Get one of them talking.  He's exiting the studio.  He might make this on the buzzer.  Oh, shit.  On the buzzer.  Okay.  He's got two minutes.  Two minutes to get down the hall.  That's okay.  Is he going to the bathroom?  Oh, I hope not.  Well, if he does, I hope it's a piss.  It was a long interview.  He's walking up the hall. 
[02:42:30]  On my way to you is the message I'm getting.  Hang on, Sam.  On the way.  Just made it.  I don't know about that yet.  Yeah, I'll make it.  You think?  He went to the bathroom.  He went to the bathroom.  See?  What do we do, Ant?  What do we do?  Oh, no.  We're going to look like pussies here, man.  Yes, the publicists were giving Roland all their phony apologies.  Oh, we're running late.  Sorry.  Phony apologies.  You don't think they're sincere, Kenny?  No, no, no.  No?  Bullshitters. 
[02:43:00]  Bullshitters.  Shitters.  Well, what do we do?  I don't know.  Maybe he's pissing out a kidney stone, old boy.  One minute.  He's so nasty.  Everyone's excited.  One minute.  Actually, you know, 65 seconds from.  Roland says, running to you after the restroom.  One minute on Mark.  Uh-oh.  It's a minute.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Come on. 
[02:43:30]  Uh-oh.  If he's that close, come on.  We have to.  We're going to look like pussies.  I'm telling you.  Nah.  You know what?  I'm acknowledging.  We're really not.  We're going to look like pussies.  9.30 was our cutoff.  If he was still in there.  We're going to look like pussies.  I'm telling you.  I would say, yeah.  Then turn off your Twitter, because they are going to beat the shit out of us.  I don't care.  Oh, Sam.  30 seconds.  What, Sam?  Sam?  Not yet, but Roland said he does believe it's number one.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He's doing a wee-wee, which is okay. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  But he may just be saying that to save himself.  We're down to one minute.  We don't have a minute.  We have 15 seconds.  11.  10.  9.  8.  7.  6.  I still have 9.29 on my iPhone, which is more accurate.  1.  And there it is on our studio clock.  What?  9.30.  What?  He's still in the bathroom.  He must be doing number two.  Oh, man.  If he's taking a Cusack dump. 
[02:44:30]  That's pretty good.  Kenny with a little recon.  Kenny?  Kenny's got some reconnaissance.  He just walked out of the bathroom.  Hopefully he'll have a piss stain in his pants.  Wow, Kenny.  It's still 9.30.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy.  You said buy 9.30.  As long as you said, 9.30.  All right.  What is Paul saying?  Have a few seconds left.  Oh, no, you don't.  It's not 9.31. 
[02:45:00]  It's still technically 9.30.  It is still 9.30.  That's fair enough.  But it's about to become 9.31.  Oh, 15 seconds.  15 seconds.  Oh, 14.  Right there.  There he comes.  Oh, yeah.  He's a tall guy.  Wow, that's right under the wire, right?  It really is.  Right under the wire.  Yeah.  John Cusack walking into the studio.  He's doing something with his coat.  He's doing something with his coat.  Huh?  He's doing something with his jacket.  I think.  No, it's another jacket.  Oh, yeah.  It's very relaxed. 
[02:45:30]  What happened?  We're very relaxed.  Come on in.  We don't bite.  We just did Howard.  How bad can we be?  Yeah.  No problem.  There he is.  John Cusack.  John Cusack.  That's Jimmy.  Anthony, how you doing?  That's Opie.  What's up, John?  You don't have to worry about Sam Roberts right there.  Huh?  Yeah.  That's all right.  I don't know.  Probably over the years.  Yeah, I think so.  I saw The Raven last night and right off the bat. 
[02:46:00]  We're actually on the air, by the way.  Yeah, we're on the air.  I know.  We just.  I'm sorry.  We're kind of casual here.  I saw The Raven last night.  I loved it.  You liked it?  Period.  Yeah.  I really did.  Oh, great, man.  You play Edgar Allan Poe, obviously.  Very iconic.  It's a murder mystery.  Yeah.  It's shot very dark.  The cinematography is really good.  And a lot of blood.  Yeah.  Well, he was the godfather of God.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah.  He started the whole gothic horror thing.  He was writing all these, you know, nobody had really done that besides, like, the Grimm's. 
[02:46:30]  Grimm's book.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that used to scare me as a kid, too.  Yeah.  Grimm's fairy tales.  Right?  Pretty frightening.  You just won $20.  Well, Ian knows a lot about you, because he said you would say that.  No, I like the godfather goth.  But you said he would say that.  That's cool.  And we had a little side bet, and I just lost money.  It, like, makes Edgar Allan Poe more, you know.  You just knew that.  Well, it has the added benefit of being true, but I have to impress to her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, you know, guilty as charged.  I couldn't understand.  Believe me. 
[02:47:00]  Believe me.  What did you learn about Edgar Allan Poe?  But it is true that he started all that, so.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of, you know, saying, hey, go see a movie, you know, like a boring biopic about  a poet.  You would say, this guy was kind of a lunatic who started the whole horror genre stuff.  He sounds like a manic depressive.  Like, he's just like a manic depressive crazy writer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know, from anywhere from Rod Serling to Stephen King, you could  sort of feel all this stuff he did. 
[02:47:30]  So, I was just trying to give people context, but I was being a little lazy in the pool.  No, we're not saying that.  That was hilarious.  I swear we're not saying that.  We just had a side bet, and I lost.  I'm a little mad.  That's all.  No, God.  No, what do we know about Edgar Allan Poe?  Because his life was very mysterious.  Well, we knew that he went to West Point.  He was a poet.  He knew Robert E. Lee.  Well, he actually founded his first book of poetry.  You knew that, right?  I think so, right?  Robert E. Lee?  Yeah, he funded his first book of poetry. 
[02:48:00]  I learned that in literature class in college.  Wow.  Yeah, he funded both people he went to college.  They went to college together.  Which I found very fascinating.  Robert E. Lee was the one that funded Edgar Allan Poe, originally.  I didn't, for some reason, that missed my degree.  Then I either failed that test, or my teacher was an asshole.  Probably both.  Both, you think?  Yeah.  That's what I mean about Edgar Allan Poe, though.  He was very mysterious.  Like, half this stuff, you don't know if it's true.  Because I also heard that he was a drunk.  And then some people say that he was allergic to alcohol.  Well, I mean, I think both at the same time, I think he definitely, like, when he started 
[02:48:30]  drinking, he couldn't stop, so I think he went on these long binges.  He's bingey.  Yeah.  Poe bingey.  You're a bigger guy than I thought you'd be.  Like, not heavy, but just, like, you're, for some reason on film, like, usually it's  just the opposite.  But I always thought John was, like, a really small...  No, you're tall.  ...guy.  Yeah.  You're a bigger dude than I am.  How tall are you?  6'2".  Jesus Christ.  I would have thought you were 5'8".  I know.  Seriously.  Yeah, you're a bigger guy.  I don't know why, but that's probably because I play weird characters. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Quirky.  Yeah.  Quirky roles.  They don't look as tall.  What does this take to Edgar Allan Poe that we haven't seen in the past?  Like, obviously it's fictitious, but it's based on his story.  It's like a mixture of, like, fact, fiction, and sort of legend.  Yeah.  So it's basically like, you know, because Poe always wrote about, like, the line between  sanity and insanity and waking and dreaming.  So it's like, he was always going for that twilight, like, life and death. 
[02:49:30]  He was always skulking around graveyards and, you know.  What a creep.  Well, yeah.  He was definitely like, you know, he definitely was.  But, and so this is a film where he sort of gets wrapped up in one of his stories.  Somebody starts to copycat his horror stories, and then the cops think it's Poe.  Oh, okay.  And they ask Poe to sort of deconstruct the mind of the killer who's imitating Poe, and  it's like he's caught up in one of his stories.  So it's kind of a fiction that's, but that you're allowed to, like, have Poe then talk 
[02:50:00]  about all of his stories.  Right.  Oh, that's pretty cool, yeah.  And that's all on the record, so you can use, like, stuff he actually said.  So it's kind of like that.  How do you play that?  It's like a horror version of Amadeus or something.  But, like, you know, much more pulpy.  Yeah, the murders are based on, obviously, Edgar Allan Poe stories, which I found fascinating.  You've got to wonder what...  So it's all the stuff you read in high school, you know.  Yeah, yep.  Well, I told him the pit.  Telltale Heart, Pit and the Pendulum.  I'm not giving anything away, but the pit and the pendulum scene in this movie, oh, my  God.  It's pretty hardcore.  It's really hardcore. 
[02:50:30]  I know.  But you've got to think, like, that's the guy, you know, I think he'd see the Saw franchises  and go, yep, that's mine.  Right, right, right.  You know, he sort of, you know, he created all that.  I appreciate that you guys didn't hold back.  I mean, that scene was, wow.  Well, you sort of, you couldn't, you know, and the director, James McTeague, did V for Vendetta,  and he's a really great director.  Yeah, that's a good movie.  And he was like, hey, man, it's the Poe, it's the source.  You've got to, like, you know, if you do Poe halfway, you're going to be in trouble.  Right.  What do you do when you're playing a guy like that?  Like, what's the first quality you said, okay, because, you know, he's an actor, you've 
[02:51:00]  got to figure out how you're going to do it.  What's the first quality you kind of picked out and associated with him that you at least  wanted to portray?  I think he, probably the overwhelming kind of thing was his sort of sense of sort of,  he was sort of an anguished kind of guy.  And I think he was, so I think, you know, you had to have that sort of weird sadness or  this, that part of him that was, didn't really want to go, you know, he was very rebellious  and, you know, that's sort of what made him sort of an icon, you know? 
[02:51:30]  I mean, it's like, you know, Kurt Cobain was so, you know, he was definitely like fucked  up and sad, but charismatic, right?  I think that's how, that's how.  For his day, for the, for the 1800s, it is odd.  I think he was like a really, just a different cat.  And he had a rock star.  He had a track.  He was a bit of that, like for the day.  Yeah.  He was super famous because he had written The Raven and it was world famous and he,  and he got, he went to the White House drunk, you know, and, but he, but there's no copyright 
[02:52:00]  so he couldn't get paid.  So he got like paid a couple bucks for it.  Yeah.  So he's like famous, but so he's always.  He's destitute and all the women in his life always died early.  And it was like, he was like a, he's kind of a tragic guy.  You got to wonder, you got to wonder if, if anybody in that time thought almost a couple  of hundred years later that he'd be portrayed like this in a medium that he couldn't possibly  even understand.  Like it's odd when you think of, of so much time going by and somebody still having such 
[02:52:30]  an influence on, on people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was also like, he would, he would do these things like, uh, he did all these  different genres where he'd do like these science fiction hoaxes and stuff.  And so they say that he influenced Jules Verne.  So he'd do these stories about like balloons that went to outer space in the 1800s and pretend  they were real.  And then he would, he would do all these kinds of crazy stories.  He was, he was, he was, he was out there.  Yeah.  Was his wife 13 when he got married?  I think.  Wow.  I think he was 26 and she was 13.  Oh, it was a different time. 
[02:53:00]  Well, yeah, but then Jerry Lee Lewis did it.  So he didn't change that much.  To be honest.  But my question is, was it accepted back then?  Or did society look at this guy like, what a creep.  I think everybody lived a lot.  Um, they didn't live as long.  Right.  So it's probably right on the border, but yeah.  Get it while you can.  But the incest thing too, his first cousin, or was that more acceptable then too?  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  Yeah.  Without the ability to sext, it was very hard to find girls back then.  You had to stay within your family. 
[02:53:30]  Within your town.  There was no Twitter.  I think he was like, um, you know, maybe it's just cause I sort of played him and studied  him, but I think he was more like he just wanted to, I think he wanted anybody to warm  down.  Like he wanted, he wanted the company of women, you know, more than he was like a playboy  or.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he just needed like somebody to like keep him, you know, sane.  So he just needed like a home base.  Someone there.  He needed a woman to take care of him cause he'd be like, have to recover from his binges  and stuff.  I know what that's like.  Sometimes you're home alone and you're just like, uh, with your own thoughts. 
[02:54:00]  I don't like that at all.  And a bad hangover.  I hate being alone with my thoughts.  It's called being a codependent.  Oh, right.  You need somebody else there all the time to kind of help you through your alcohol.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I could, I like to take a drink or two every so often, but not, no, but I mean  for him too.  It's like, if you need a woman there to kind of nurse you back to hell, that's like my  codependence.  Yeah.  I think that's a, I think that's what his deal was with the, with the women.  Yeah.  Are you still kickboxing?  Yeah.  I still do that.  You really been doing that for 20 years?  Yeah.  I fucking, that's one of those things that you always hear about.  Like, I wish I was strong as a swear on the radio.  I know.  It is.  It has been. 
[02:54:30]  Was it hard for you guys when you started to like not think, oh my God, I just totally  screwed up?  It just seemed so wrong because with the, all the equipment's the same as when we were on  regular terrestrial radio.  I thought we were on regular terrestrial radio.  I forgot.  I was like.  Oh shoot, we are.  And then when you're talking into the microphone, there's just something in your head that says  you shouldn't be doing it.  Right, right.  And then you kind of get used to it after a while.  You just forget, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every other word though, when we first started, it was like, fuck, fuck, fuck, because it  was just kind of a novelty.  What was the most used swear for the first month? 
[02:55:00]  I think fuck.  It's got to be fun.  Fuck's always the number one curse.  Because just regular conversation, you kind of use it a lot.  Shit comes out a lot too.  Yeah.  That's one you just say all the time.  It would be awful.  It's like a really horrible one.  Not cunt.  Yeah, that one.  By far the most hardcore.  I just think it's very odd that people.  I like cunt because the Brits use it as a compliment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You cunt.  Fucking cunt.  Yeah, I like that too.  It's just one of those things though that like people that get tripped up and they curse 
[02:55:30]  and they're like, oh, we heard that guy curse.  But that's how people kind of really talk.  Not all the time, but it is peppered into people's conversation.  And I think it's hypocritical to say like, you know, oh, that person, I heard them swear.  But what do Brits call girls then?  A bird.  No, when they're mad.  I mean, seriously.  Oh.  Like we have talked, that's the atom bomb in America.  It's the atomic bomb in an argument with a girl in America.  Yeah.  So what do the Brits use?  Yeah, that's a big one.  That's DEFCON 5.  Yeah.  But what do they use to replace that word in Britain? 
[02:56:00]  Uh, for a bad, for like a, instead of, yeah.  Because if, if you could say con and it's no big deal and you really want to get to a  woman like some of us do here in America, what's the word?  Not trollop.  Does anyone know?  Some people are saying trollop.  What year is this?  I don't know.  Trollop.  Trollop is a.  Trollop.  I don't, I think they would, they wouldn't get mad at that one.  No, that almost sounds fun and sexy.  Yeah.  She's a trollop.  She's a trollop.  Oh, you little trollop.  What else do you want to say about, well, I want to ask you about the movie because you never  know what, you know, you should talk about cause you want to see, uh, people to see this. 
[02:56:30]  So what else you, you want to talk about as far as, uh, the Raven goes?  Well, I mean, I personally really liked it.  I'll, I'll tell you this much.  You guys didn't, you know, uh, you went all in even with the ending, which I liked too.  Yeah.  Cause Hollywood maybe would have taken a different spin on that in general.  No, no, we, we didn't.  You went all in and I like, I appreciate that as a, as a guy that likes watching films.  I think if, I think it's like a thriller, um, horror mystery, you know, um, and it's  based on the guy who sort of started the genres. 
[02:57:00]  Right.  So I think if you like all those types of movies, you know, you'll find it kind of, I  think it's delivers on that end and hopefully it delivers on, you can see where it all sort  of came from and you can see sort of one of the originators of the whole, the whole  craze, but that's just the history of it.  But then I think it just works as like a, as a movie, as a, as a, as a, uh, the opening  scene had me hooked on my horror suspense thriller, you know, that's sort of what it is.  Did you, did you, but it's a little smarter cause Poe is smarter.  He was like, he was a, he was real literate. 
[02:57:30]  Did you meet with, uh, a Stephen King when you were doing 1408?  Did you ever, I never met with him, but we were, we were, I was always nervous, you  know, when he saw the movie.  Oh really?  Well, cause yeah, it's like, it's his thing.  It's his story.  So, so like when I made, I made high fidelity and the most nervous I was is when Nick Hornby  saw it.  I was like, I was like, if you, if it sucks, it's okay.  I'm sorry.  Let me know.  And I apologize.  The good thing about Stephen King though, he liked a 1408.  That was a fucking scary movie, man.  That was a really scary film.  I think if you like 1408, you'll like, yeah, yeah, there you go. 
[02:58:00]  It's, it's, uh, and I think King, you know, actually King, um, he came out and said that  he liked the Raven.  Well, I want to say that.  Oh, very cool.  I want to say that for you.  You're downplaying it.  Stephen King said that John is brilliant as Poe in this movie.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Wow.  That is a pretty goddamn cool right there.  Stephen King, he's the master of, uh, he's, he's the modern day Poe.  He's a little wordy though.  Let's be honest.  I mean, some of these books are a little wordy.  A lot of times his movies, a lot of times his films, if he has too much of a hand in  them, aren't as good.  Like the shining he hated, but that was just cause Kubrick did what he wanted to do with 
[02:58:30]  it.  And 1408 was a really scary movie that kind of stayed true to the book.  Like I fucking really liked that movie.  I like creepy movies.  I think he gets a, uh, he's such an amazing writer.  He just gets a bad rap.  I think from like critics and stuff.  I think cause he's so well known and well sold.  But you know why?  I think it's one of the thing is because in his writing, like some of the writers, they  never use brand names.  Right.  Because they think it's so, you know, and he's like, yeah, the Colgate, like he just  uses Pepsi and all that stuff.  So it's like, it feels pop. 
[02:59:00]  But if you look at the writing, he's a great writer.  He's a great writer of nonfiction too.  I mean, even the movie Stand By Me, I was in another Stephen King and it's like, it's  a great story.  You know?  So he's a terrific writer, man.  But people think they're being intellectual by smashing him.  Like they, it's like, I think totally right.  And because he writes, I think cause he writes with, he puts brand names into his narratives  and like good writers don't do that.  And yeah, but that's just what he does.  And it makes it a lot more relatable and natural.  And you kind of get a lot more in depth with the characters.  If they're using the same shit you use, yeah, they're doing the same thing. 
[02:59:30]  He has a way of humanizing his characters really well.  And I'm putting them in horrific situations.  And it's people that enjoy him.  A lot of people don't want to think, hey, I enjoy something.  That all these average people enjoy because that somehow makes me average.  So they like to feel smarter than him by just shitting on him.  I think that's right.  He's a great writer.  And I think like when, you know, whenever you're doing like a movie or something and  you can, when I was doing that 1408, he made a 20 page, 25 page short story.  And we kept going back in that thing and pull stuff from it.  Really?  Seemingly endlessly because he's just such a great writer. 
[03:00:00]  That's great.  But I disagree with him on The Shining though.  I thought like Stephen King did a version of The Shining.  I liked The Shining too.  It was amazing.  So I sort of disagreed with King too on that just because I just loved that movie.  I think now he's, he's come around with it.  I think once you let time decide, I mean, now it's a classic, The Shining.  It's just one of those movies that, you know, sometimes, you know, you have like a, you can  have an experience with somebody creatively that is not really good.  And then you just sort of, you know, you, you, that sort of colors how you view the thing.  It's like they poison the screen. 
[03:00:30]  They poison the movie.  Oh, who are you talking about?  Perhaps Kubrick was not a bad thing.  Maybe it's Kubrick.  Oh boy.  Maybe he had an experience here and sort of poisoned his viewing of the film.  Yeah.  Maybe he didn't like the way he was treated or something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  He didn't have as much input, I think, as he wanted.  And Kubrick totally changed.  Like you have, you have a vision of something you create and you kind of wanted to see  it portrayed that way.  Right.  But on the screen, you couldn't have made that a more frightening film.  You got to respect what Kubrick did with that.  Yeah.  He wasn't supposed to kill Scatman Crothers.  Right.  But you got to respect.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:01:00]  He was supposed to chase him with a fucking mallet, not an ax.  And also they were hedge animals and not a hedge.  But it's harder to make in a movie in 1980.  Right.  Right.  You know, hedge animals.  There was no CGI.  That's true.  Although the scariest movie still is The Exorcist, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like.  And that.  Yeah.  It's hockey stats and everybody else.  Nobody else comes close.  Yeah.  How do you, what do you attribute that your long success from, especially from child actor  to now, do you see a lot of luck in there or did you have some kind of plan that kind 
[03:01:30]  of got you through?  Both, but a lot, a lot of luck.  A lot of luck?  I think so.  Yeah, because some people really crash and burn.  I mean, there's been a multitude of stories about that.  You've had a great career that's spanned, you know, quite a few years from when you  were a kid till now.  It really is amazing.  No, it's a lot, it's a lot of luck.  You know, I started off when I was in the right place at the right time and at the right  different moments, I've gotten to work with really good people.  So I think, you know, I work hard.  Yeah.  I give it my best, but it's a lot, a lot of it's luck.  You first make out scene, were you nervous doing that? 
[03:02:00]  I've done one and it was fucking horrendous for her.  He didn't like it either.  Yeah, it's a little weird because it's technical in a weird way, you know, so it's not as...  That's what everybody says.  It's not, you know, yeah, it's much more technical.  Did you talk about it first or did you just do it or did you go like, look, should we use  tongue or should we not use tongue?  Because I actually talked it up with him and I'm like, I don't know.  I don't remember.  It was a while ago, but I think, I don't think we talked about it.  I think I just sort of went with it.  Just kind of, just get in there.  Yeah, I just wanted to discuss it with a girl first.  Do you watch UFC? 
[03:02:30]  No, you know, I'm much more of a boxing fan.  Oh, okay.  I don't like, I just think once it gets to the ground, I don't like seeing guys getting  smashed on the ground.  I just, you know, I like, I sort of, I think if you go down, I like the idea of, you know,  get back on your feet and knock out and then the 10 count and I just don't like the grounded  pound thing.  So when you, when you kickbox, you use more your feet and more your hands?  Yeah.  It's stand up fighting.  What's that?  Stand up, like more stand up.  Okay, but you can kick though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Feet and hands.  Are you black belt? 
[03:03:00]  I don't know.  I suppose I am.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a guy who can really fight.  Are you a black belt?  Like, I'm not sure.  I guess you'd call it that.  You want him to kick you?  No, I don't.  I train with, I've been training with a guy for 20 years, 25 years, who is one of the  greatest in the world, the greatest who ever lived, Benny the Jet.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, sure.  Didn't he train Duff McKagan too?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  He trained a lot of good guys, but he's, you know, he's a one percenter.  He's a one percenter of one percenter of those guys.  So he's just an amazing guy to be around and, you know, stretches and I've worked with some 
[03:03:30]  of his fighters for a long time, but it's, you know, he does grappling.  He does all that stuff.  I just, you know, I just like the, I always loved boxing growing up.  Have you had to use it?  I'll be very into when Floyd Mayweather fights Kono, I'm going to be right there.  I think, you know, I'd love to see the Pacquiao Mayweather fight.  I just love great fighting.  Do you think Mayweather's avoiding that fight?  Because it seems to me like.  I don't think so.  I don't know what's going on with that.  Maybe they're just trying to push it up so they get the huge money.  Get the money up.  I think.  But they've, boxing has done that for so long. 
[03:04:00]  That's why UFC has taken off almost because a lot of times the boxing matches you want  to see takes so long to get to.  That's true.  And it's like, just the guys in the business end of it have made it harder to, because  everybody wants to see Mayweather.  They also, you know, they always screw it up.  They don't, they should get the best fighters fighting each other.  They know how to put on good fights, but they, you know.  Yeah.  It's always been that way, though, with boxing.  Yeah.  It's been more about the show than the actual event, you know.  But then every once in a while, like one of the, you get one of the great boxing matches  and there's nothing better. 
[03:04:30]  I mean, there just isn't.  Yeah.  They're remembered forever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had Frazier in and he was, he was, he was.  You see those documentaries?  The Thrill of a Nile.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  But it really humanizes him a lot more.  And you realize like, wow, Ali was a prick sometimes.  Even though I love Ali, it's like, yeah, he was a prick.  Like, it's fun.  Those are, those are such great documentaries.  And it's like, you know, you're doing the Poe thing and it's like, this is one version  of Poe.  And then, you know, Lou Reed's got his version of Poe.  And like, there's going to be another version of Poe.  And it's like, that's, there's one Ali.  And then there's the Ali from the Frazier documentary.  Yeah.  Then there's the Ali and the Larry on, Larry and Muhammad that's 30 on 31 on ESPN. 
[03:05:00]  Did you see that?  I haven't seen that one yet.  Check that one out.  Unbelievable.  That's when Larry Holmes had to fight Muhammad Ali and he was 38 and he was already showing  signs and of, of the warranty.  Yeah.  And it was like his people were sort of pushing him in and they were milking that last cash  car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Larry Holmes is real terrible.  Didn't Larry not want to hurt him?  Yeah.  He was just so conflicted about him.  And it's a, so it's another portrait.  It's another angle and all that.  There's some great docs.  Didn't Larry Holmes, when they were fighting, we were kings. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, that's one of the amazing ones.  I mean, yeah.  If you want to, that's amazing.  You know about boxing.  Oh, it's right there.  Didn't he not want to, like, didn't he say to the referee, like, you got to stop that?  Didn't he not want to keep fighting Ali?  Cause he, like, he trained with him and when we were kings, he was his training partner.  He loved Ali.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he just didn't want, he was afraid he was going to hurt him.  Yes.  Is it tough to see Ali like he is?  Yeah.  It really is.  Right.  I understand people get old and shit happens, but with Ali, you just don't want to hurt him.  I don't want to see him like that.  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  I think the Parkinson's has gotten really bad.  Now we're going to see.  They brought him out for the first pitch down there in Florida.  I was like, I didn't want to see that, man.  Yeah.  George Foreman too is another guy that I loved.  And I loved, I loved his comeback and the whole thing of his comeback.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  We met him.  His fist is as big as your head.  Yeah.  His, I've never seen a fist bigger in my life.  Did you like him before then though?  Like when he, when he, before he became like the lovable guy or when he was both, you  know, cause I thought he was just a great fighter.  But then I thought when he came back to, to win the heavyweight championship, 20 years 
[03:06:30]  removed from each other, that's probably the most underrated thing to do in history.  Huge.  Yeah.  Huge.  And just a movie moment really was, that shouldn't happen.  But that's like, that's, that's not, that's not possible.  Yeah.  45 to 25.  Yeah.  That is pretty crazy.  It shouldn't happen.  It's one of those things that only happen in, uh, in the movies.  Yeah.  They're telling us, John is to wrap up.  He's a busy guy.  John, I'll tell you this much.  I saw the movie.  I want to say it again.  I really, really enjoyed it.  I enjoyed your performance. 
[03:07:00]  I think people are going to really dig this movie.  I would love to have seen it, but we only got one copy.  Oh man.  We only got one copy.  Now you got to go to the theater.  It comes out next, uh, next week.  A week from Friday.  And I read, I read in the paper, you're doing something, I think today at, um, the Apple  store in Soho.  I guess so.  Yeah.  But it's cool.  You're going to, what the paper's saying is you're going to go down there and just talk  about the movie in front of a crowd.  That's, that's all right, man.  I guess so.  A little different.  Oh, you know, wherever they take me.  So basically you're going to have to make up some stuff. 
[03:07:30]  That's great.  And it's at John Cusack on Twitter, just to promote the Twitter too.  Um, can I say that I, I just love your sister in, uh, Shameless by the way.  Yeah.  She's awesome.  Her character in that is just amazing.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We'd love to talk to her someday, but I'm just kidding.  She'll come on.  I always think that's got to be a unique thing, having two very successful actors in  the family.  And, you know, when you do sit down at a family moment, kind of go, Hey, you see my show?  Hey, you see my movie?  Yeah.  It's also nice too.  Cause it's, um, you know, she's my sister and I love her and she's so great.  So it's always, you always get like a reflected glow, you know, cause everybody loves my sister. 
[03:08:00]  So yeah, she's great.  It's not competitive at all.  No.  Cause you know, I don't know.  She's, she's a girl.  She's, I'm not, she's not taking my role.  Right.  You know, I don't want to, I don't want to play the girl on Chandler.  But I just know I'm not competitive with, with my family.  That's cool.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to get them out.  Yeah.  Well, I want to see the movie and it's, uh, the Raven April 27th.  Right.  John Cusack.  All right.  You've heard about it. 
[03:08:30]  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After Opie and Anthony live is coming up next.  And now the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is after O and A live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:09:00]  We're on the air.  What are you talking about today?  Lots of stuff.  Lots of times.  I don't know what I'm talking about until.  No, I know.  I'm talking about it.  I know you're going to do.  What did, uh, what did you learn?  Yeah, we'll get to that.  I like that you're doing that.  Um.  And I know you take a lot of notes.  So read over your notes.  Well, I'm definitely going to talk about John Cusack.  Uh, call Chad Dukes a filthy liar.  Oh, right.  Oh, shit.  He calls John Cusack an asshole.  Maybe Chad Dukes isn't a professional.  He's not a professional. 
[03:09:30]  Because, obviously, John Cusack was a very pleasant person.  I'm going to produce your show from now on.  Okay.  You've got to get Chad Dukes back on the phone.  Iraq!  You've got to get the Chad back on the phone.  Not, I'm not talking to him because I'm getting the fuck out of here.  Right.  You should talk to him.  And say, look.  What else is in your notes?  Um.  Let me see.  Definitely talk about Ant's fight with a bicycle cab guy.  Uh.  Chip is laughing at me.  Um.  Roland and Jim. 
[03:10:00]  I want to see what was going on there.  Because, remember, at the beginning of the show, Jim said that Roland got a little mad at him.  Yeah, I saw that.  So I was going to talk to Roland about it.  Why would you cross it off?  I'm in the middle of reading it.  I'm sorry.  You're not sorry.  Um.  I lost a follower for tweeting a John Cusack picture.  I mean, what's wrong with people?  He doesn't want to see his fucking face.  I think that's my first tweet of the day.  Really?  That upset you that you don't follow me?  This guy goes, I'm tired of seeing John Cusack everywhere.  I turn around.  That's it. 
[03:10:30]  Really?  Was that?  No, but I mean, why else would you just decide to unfollow someone?  Usually you unfollow someone after you read a tweet and you don't agree with it or something.  Like, you immediately unfollow that person.  So if I only tweeted a John Cusack picture in the last hour, that means.  He didn't want to see it.  That means the John Cusack picture I tweeted bothered him so much he had to unfollow me.  Which do you think is his least favorite John Cusack movie?  I don't know a lot of John Cusack movies.  I know a lot of them.  My favorite is High Fidelity. 
[03:11:00]  High Fidelity is really good.  That's before Jack Black was a complete asshole.  You find him to be a complete asshole?  I think so, yeah.  Well, Chad Dukes finds...  Jack Black loves Jack Black.  He is a big Jack Black fan.  He is the biggest Jack Black fan.  But Chad Dukes said John Cusack was a complete asshole.  You know what?  I didn't get that vibe whatsoever.  No.  Me neither.  I thought he was beyond cool, down to earth, willing to talk about anything.  Chad Dukes must have a stick up his ass.  Do we look like assholes or not?  That's what you have to fucking work out in this hour. 
[03:11:30]  Well, I was going to explore that, too, and talk about, you know...  I personally, when I say 9.30, that means 9.30.  These guys were fooling around with the 9.30 going,  well, it's still 9.30 until 9.31.  And he was in sight.  This is the only defense I have.  Yes.  He was in sight outside the studio before it hit 9.31.  Right.  That's my only defense.  So are we assholes or are we not?  No, I think...  And I mean for this point alone, not in general.  I understand that you're going to call me an asshole no matter what. 
[03:12:00]  But on this point, are we assholes or not?  I think today you are not.  He was right outside the studio.  The door was open.  At 9.30.  At 9.30, he was here.  Who cares?  It was 9.30 in 50 seconds, right?  It was 9.30.  It was right there.  It was on the nose.  I want to take people inside the show.  A guy named Mike Shanley.  I'll give him a plug in everything in Michigan.  He goes,  This guy, meaning John Cusack,  is a puss just like you guys are for letting him in. 
[03:12:30]  What was puss about him?  He was talking about his movie.  Here's a guy that doesn't understand the show because I will break down a wall today.  Do it.  We like looking like pussies sometimes.  Everyone thinks we're just tough guys all the time.  No, we're not.  Sometimes we like looking like pussies.  Why do you?  And the John Cusack thing made us look kind of pussy-ish.  How come you like looking like pussies sometimes?  Because you want to give everyone a bunch of different looks, Sam.  You want to show your vulnerable side so people don't think you're untouchable.  Yes.  Yes!  Because then they'll try to overthrow the king. 
[03:13:00]  Then Mike Shanley then writes,  Funny how Opie and Anthony both talk so much shit until they're on the spot.  What the F?  Oh, that's a what the F.  What the F?  Did you hear we were replaying some what the F the other day?  E-Rock's what the F bit is one of my favorites.  Well, that's right.  And then he goes,  Time for me to look for a new show.  We'll go find another show.  So today that perfectly wonderful John Cusack interview  led to you losing one Twitter follower and one listener to the Opie Anthony show.  Might be the same guy, Sam. 
[03:13:30]  Could be.  Might be the same guy.  Oh, fuck that.  I don't even want to see him.  But, uh, all right.  Whatever.  I guess he wanted us to shut the door in his face,  but technically he was here by 930.  Yeah.  There were fans, but I told you guys.  But the other side of it is,  I don't mind that everyone is pointing and laughing going,  Oh, what pussies?  They backed down at the last minute.  I don't, you know, that, I think that's good radio too.  And I told you during the commercial break too,  that any of the fans that didn't,  because you guys were kind of talking about how people didn't get that  that was still a good interview,  that the whole time they were saying, 
[03:14:00]  Oh, boo, you were supposed to kick him out and blah, blah, blah.  You can't give the listeners to this channel a smell of that blood  because you let them smell the blood and they started snarling.  And then when you take the steak away.  Right.  But what did Ann say?  You got a bunch of angry dogs.  What was the instant feedback that he read?  I don't remember.  After the show.  Oh, that John Cusack's answers were coming across.  Oh, a little, uh, uh, uh, uh, not cunty, did he say?  No, he didn't say that, but something. 
[03:14:30]  There was just so much discussion of the cunt word.  No, but it was something like that.  And we didn't get that at all, by the way,  but it goes to your point that we set,  we were trying to set up John Cusack to fail as a goof, by the way.  Right.  Turns out he's a cool guy.  He's got to do something.  I look forward to him coming back.  But so they, they try to pick up on any little nuance.  Right.  They're just, they're just wanting, they need that meat.  It wasn't there though.  I mean, the guy was, he was all right.  No, he was great.  All right.  Sam, enjoy your, uh, 
[03:15:00]  I'm going to go over here.  I do not call it the shit show.  Thank you for that.  I don't either for, for, for what it's worth.  Cause if, cause that means then I run a shit show.  Yeah.  That's what I never understood about you guys.  I'm like, you can't call it the shit show.  That means we run a shit show.  Yeah.  Any insult to this program.  I mean, we don't like it all, but I know you don't like me as a human being,  but to call it a shit show, then that reflects badly on us.  Cause why would you put it on your channel to follow you?  Exactly.  It doesn't make any sense.  It doesn't at all. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  Have a good afternoon, Opie.  Chad Dukes.  I don't, I was just talking with Joe Villa the other day.  I don't think it's a shit show.  I think it's a fine radio program.  That's what I'm talking about.  You and Joe Villa are a couple of guys with good heads on your shoulders.  But today, Chad, what did you, did you hear the, uh, uh, the John Cusack interview?  Yeah.  I heard the whole thing.  He dropped that.  What did he say?  The master of the macabre.  In the first 30 seconds of the interview, I thought, I thought that was going to be it. 
[03:16:00]  There was going to be an explosion.  It did not go the way that I thought it was going to.  That's for sure.  He did.  He dropped Godfather of Goth.  That was the phrase that pays today.  And he dropped it within, I don't know, Eric, can you, can you get the interview?  And can we, I think it was with 30 seconds of being, you know, interviewed that he dropped  that.  All right.  Let's get it, yeah, get the interview.  And I want to play it from the time he starts talking to when he drops Godfather of Goth.  So he was more friendly with us, Chad, than he was with you?  Well, you got to remember, we were, you know, one market zilches at the time doing a phoner 
[03:16:30]  for like a bad movie that he was in.  I, it probably wasn't the best circumstances for us.  But as soon as, I think Obi said, we, we, you, you know, I just lost a bet because  you said what we thought you were going to say beforehand.  And he said, well, I'm on a press tour here, guys.  Yeah.  And he showed that little glimmer of like a sense of humor.  He, he won me back over after that portion.  I thought it was a great job, especially with having to wait around for Power to finish  up with his interview.  Yeah.  I mean, and then also those moments also make it like, oh, we're actually talking to a 
[03:17:00]  human being now, not just a promotional vehicle.  So what movie, what movie was he talking to for you guys?  Because that's what I was thinking when I was looking.  At Cusack, I was like, well, obviously he likes this movie.  And I figured that when he was an asshole to you and big O in DC, he must've been promoting  something he didn't even like.  He didn't even want to call in for.  You know, it might've been that 1408 movie.  And I was surprised to hear, I know Jimmy says that he loves the movie, the guys in the  studio.  I think Jimmy's been honest, but I didn't think that movie was particularly good.  And I think that he knew it wasn't particularly good. 
[03:17:30]  That's what he was doing.  Press Sam, if you don't mind, why have you?  And we're talking.  Let's do it.  How much of it was a disaster is it that the tag champs job to the great Khali this past  week?  I really think they need to bolster that tag team division inside the WWE.  Yeah.  I mean, the thing about it is he's, you know, WWE, I don't like non-title matches very  frequently and I definitely don't understand when champions lose on a consistent basis.  It doesn't make them, it doesn't put much faith in championships. 
[03:18:00]  It doesn't.  And Khali can't even move anymore.  And I guess I don't want to the Indian market, but I just, to have that guy in there sloughing  around the ring and knocking guys with straps over the head and then pitting them clean  in the middle of the ring, it pissed me off.  You got to give Khali one thing though.  He is very tall.  Very tall and very Indian and he has very large boobs, I will give him that.  Let me ask you, and Chad Dukes, you're, you're a big wrestling guy.  You, I always see you and E-Rock live tweeting raw.  I throw a couple of tweets in here and there, but when, uh, the Funkasaurus, Brodus Clay debuted, 
[03:18:30]  you were all like, you know, you were pissed off about it.  And, and ever since then I keep seeing, I read your wrestling blog and everything.  Yeah.  Um, of course, and I keep seeing little references, favorable references to Brodus Clay.  Well, I, the prime time, the biggest fraud in the world is on the other end of the phone  right now because I was at WrestleMania and I think E-Rock probably had twice the seats  that I did because I was sitting behind a pillar as well. 
[03:19:00]  But, uh, the Funkasaurus came out and myself, 33 year old overweight man stood up and was dancing  with all the grandmas at WrestleMania.  So, uh, I'm a hypocrite.  I'm a sick fan.  I, I, I hated the Funkasaurus.  I cursed him.  I said it was the worst gimmick ever.  They've ruined Brodus Clay.  And now every night on Monday night, I, I dance in my living room along with him.  It's, it's a fraud to be sure.  That's what I always say to wrestling fans is give it time.  Cause every, like you always have, wrestling fans don't want to give anything time.  They just want to jump on whatever idea is not what they expected and just smash it to bits. 
[03:19:30]  Well, how about your boy John Cena who had to take an ass beating from The Rock?  He had the job to The Rock.  I know the Funkasaurus is there once every two or three weeks.  Then on the very next night he goes out and he has to get beat down by Brock Lesnar and  A-Train in the same evening.  I mean, that guy is doing some work right now.  I don't know what they're doing to the poor guy.  And I mean, so John Cena is a, you know, we've talked about it on the show before.  Brock Lesnar returned to WWE and basically he's been on a couple times.  And every time he's on, he's just beating up John Cena who had just lost to The Rock. 
[03:20:00]  Brock Lesnar is having his first wrestling match in WWE back at their next pay-per-view.  He's fighting John Cena.  I would, I mean, I would assume that Brock Lesnar is not going to lose his first match back,  but I don't see how John Cena can lose again.  No, and weren't we promised, like, I mean, for Lesnar to come back, wouldn't it make more sense  to kind of draw it out, especially with the rumors of him fighting some Uncle Steve Austin  at WrestleMania? 
[03:20:30]  It just seems to me that immediately giving us that payoff, maybe we're just, maybe I'm  ducking.  Maybe I'm like the abused wife that, you know, has the black eyes or dragging him up and  off screaming, no, he still loves me.  Because we were, it was such a slow burn with The Rock's feud with John Cena.  And maybe that's why I'm surprised to see that at the very next pay-per-view we're going  to be rewarded with Lesnar versus Cena immediately.  Yeah, I mean, it is.  But yeah, I mean, they probably only got Brock for a year, so they want to do as much as  they can with him.  And they got to get this thing started.  I mean, and it is a very sort of instantaneous way of doing things now. 
[03:21:00]  I don't think that the John Cena-Rock buildup for a year is a sign of things to come.  I think it's definitely, right now we're living in a time where things are happening quick  and, you know, they got to turn over the product and ratings, ratings, ratings, and quarter  hours and blah, blah, blah.  You know what I mean?  The hashtag hire, Sam, I'm way behind that, by the way.  You read my site.  Your interviews are very, very good.  And I can't tell you in the Mark community, guys like me that are just like listeners, 
[03:21:30]  how jealous we are that those guys come through in studio on a regular basis up there in New  York and that you're constantly getting pumped.  You're getting the A-list.  There is a lot of jealous people up there with the access that you have to these guys.  Well, I can't say that I don't see that.  Like, I would be jealous.  And for the record, any time, the few times that somebody's around anywhere and they're  not here, I'm still jealous.  So it doesn't matter.  Now, you also said that the Busted Open show was at WrestleMania on Radio Row. 
[03:22:00]  So let's be honest, they don't do a better job of me and or E-Rock, let alone both of  us.  Well, I like those guys.  And I went up and I said hi and everything because I listened to their show.  But I mean, let's be honest, who is going to get more exposure for the WWE?  That show or with the access that you guys have?  So I mean, hopefully, hopefully next year, that's the setup.  I mean, that Radio Row setup, they do such a great job.  And I just think with the knowledge that you boys bring with the mainstream audience, I just  think that it would have been a no brainer. 
[03:22:30]  I'm just surprised that the company of its own volition didn't decide to send you down.  Serious or WWE?  They're serious.  There's a serious experience.  I mean, you'd be amazed at what goes on around here.  You'd be amazed at how many people, at who doesn't know what.  You'd be astounded.  You talk about where guys do like live broadcasts and they'll do live broadcasts from anywhere,  much less a place that's going to generate that type of publicity.  You know, you're going to have 80,000 people in a stadium.  You're going to have that many people on pay-per-view.  It's just the buzz surrounding that event is as big as anything in, quote-unquote, legitimate 
[03:23:00]  support.  I'm always surprised at how undervalued it is by media.  Yeah, but Chad Dukes, if people as smart as you and I were the ones planning everything,  who would be the ones on the air?  Yeah, exactly.  And we set the standard for what should be going on in popular culture.  That's right.  Also, Sam, if you can get more involved with the Ring of Honor people, they do shows in Baltimore.  I saw that you did a show actually from there.  That community is unbelievable. 
[03:23:30]  And they put on some of the best shows in the business.  I really like the way they kind of emphasize their in-ring work over everything else.  Yeah, I love that company.  Chad, I could talk wrestling with you all day, but we're infuriating half the audience,  so I'm going to let you go.  So I'm glad we could turn you around on John Cusack today, though.  You absolutely did.  I love the show, boys.  Thank you very much.  At NotSam on Twitter.  And at Chad Dukes on Twitter.  Thank you, Chad.  Thanks, buddy.  Talk soon.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Chad Dukes is one of the few.  We've talked about it before.  He's one of the few guys in regular radio that we actually like, so give him a follow. 
[03:24:00]  Chad Dukes.  And, yeah, I guess John Cusack didn't work out so well for him a couple years ago,  but today he was fantastic.  Let's play What Did You Learn?  866-WOW1-WOW.  Well, if you want to do that, or I have the clip ready.  Oh!  Yeah, real quick.  Yeah, start calling now, and then we'll play the clip for What Did You Learn?  So, basically, we saw John Cusack on the news calling Edgar Allan Poe the godfather of goth. 
[03:24:30]  Ant made a $20 bet with Opie.  That he would say it in this interview that he did with us today.  Now, Ant was prepared to go in and kind of get it out of him and drop key words and see what he could do.  Let's take a look from the beginning of the interview.  This is when he walks in the door.  Okay.  Exactly how long it took John Cusack to call Edgar Allan Poe the godfather of goth. 
[03:25:00]  John Cusack.  Hi, John Cusack.  That's Jimmy.  Anthony, how you doing?  That's Opie.  What's up, John?  You don't have to worry about Sam Roberts right there.  Huh?  Yeah.  That's right.  I don't know.  Probably over the years.  Yeah, I think so.  I saw The Raven last night, and right off the bat.  We're actually on the air, by the way.  Yeah, we're on the air.  Yeah, I know.  We just...  I'm sorry.  We're kind of casual here.  We're both on there.  Yeah.  I saw The Raven last night.  I loved it.  You liked it?  Period.  Yeah, I really did.  Oh, great, man.  You play Edgar Allan Poe, obviously.  Very iconic.  It's a murder mystery.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:25:30]  It's shot very dark.  The cinematography's really good.  And a lot of blood.  Yeah, well, he was the, you know, godfather of God.  Oh!  There it is.  First words out of his mouth.  The godfather of God.  You want the time?  Yeah.  37 seconds.  And that includes him walking?  When he walked in the studio to when he said it, 37 seconds.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Let's play What Did You Learn?  First of all, I'm going to do What Did I Learn?  Then you play the sweeper, Eric.  Today, I learned that Russians are scarier than black people. 
[03:26:00]  That's right.  I learned that.  Eric, hit the sweeper.  Here comes...  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  That's right.  Eric, did you learn anything?  Yes, I learned that every morning, Jimmy has to come to work looking at his friend on  a billboard.  Yes, Kevin Hart was in here, and Jim has to drive by on his way to doing radio. 
[03:26:30]  His buddy, who he saw come up right out from under him, Kevin Hart, on a giant billboard  in Times Square.  Ray in New Hampshire.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Justin from Raymond, New Hampshire.  Wow.  That was...  They just took words that you said and formed it into something else.  He actually asked me twice where I was from, too.  Jesus Christ.  What did you learn?  Well, if you're looking at Jimmy and Kevin Hart, I learned that, in this case, the black 
[03:27:00]  man makes more money.  Yeah, the black man does make more money.  It looks like the odds have evened out in that scenario.  Josh in New Jersey.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I love the after ONA live show.  Thank you.  I have to ask, how does it feel that Doc will ask me?  Well, I didn't Doc, I don't know how Doc can feel.  Oh, you son of a bitch, it's Josh in New Jersey again.  Oh, you fucking asshole.  Eric, we gotta do something about this Josh from New Jersey.  He snuck by me again.  I talked about him yesterday, remember? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, 516.  What an asshole.  John in South Carolina, what did you learn?  I learned that you can't help yourself but talk about wrestling.  Look, first of all, that is not a South Carolina accent you have, John.  No, I'm from Ireland.  Why would you go to South Carolina?  Because that's where the Sovereigners are, and they're as close as you can get to being  Irish right there.  They like drinking and fucking shit up. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Well, John, Chad Dukes and I were having an intellectual conversation about professional  wrestling.  I thought it was very appropriate.  Well, I just don't know about why you want to talk about men in little shorts and rolling  around the grinds.  You know it's fake, don't you?  No, I had no idea.  I watch it for the athletic sport of it.  Jimmy in Boston.  Eric, you gotta understand.  What is the wrestling is fake thing?  What is this argument?  Like, do people not realize that we broke the story in 1984? 
[03:28:30]  Yes, it's sports entertainment.  Like, you don't watch any scripted programs?  Well, guess what?  You know this movie, The Raven, that John Cusack is promoting?  It's a complete fake.  The guy who's in studio today is not actually Edgar Allan Poe.  What?  No, I know.  I hate to burst these illusions.  I sound like Pepper.  Jimmy in Boston.  What did you learn today?  Today I learned that Opie's a fucking pussy, and he should have stuck to the 30-minute rule.  Yeah, but he gave him until 9.30, and he was out there. 
[03:29:00]  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  My iPhone said 10.32.  Yeah, but there's a delay.  There's a delay.  Okay, so what?  A 10, 15-second delay?  I'm telling you.  More than that.  We were looking at the clocks, and John Cusack was outside the door looking right at us.  He's not even an A-lister.  If he was an A-lister, it's a different story.  He's close.  He's not an A-lister.  What list?  I'd say maybe middle B, maybe, maybe. 
[03:29:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  He's at least high B.  Get out of here, Jimmy in Boston.  What has he done?  He's done nothing.  We're playing What Did You Learn here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Edgar!  Hello.  Oh, Edgar.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Stop talking about me.  Keep talking about me.  I learned that Opie and Anthony were talking about me. 
[03:30:00]  It's a different Edgar.  It's Edgar Allan Poe.  It's not you.  I was on Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie.  Opie.  The only person who says Opie is Michio Kaku and you.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I came to try.  I understand, but you go take care of that and leave me alone.  I know that Edgar Allan Poe died because he couldn't take medicine.  His teeth were dry. 
[03:30:30]  The pills would stick to his teeth.  It's a different Edgar.  Edgar Allan Poe did not have pills stuck to his dry teeth.  I'm Edgar.  Huh?  Okay.  I'm running thin.  I'm material.  All right, Edgar.  You take care of your teeth then.  Bye.  Bye.  That was Edgar.  We all learned something.  Tony in Cleveland, what did you learn? 
[03:31:00]  Hey, fuck free Moomium, man.  Free Keith Robinson.  The IRS mafia got him.  That's right.  We learned that from Kevin Hart that the IRS mafia has Keith Robinson.  BJ and PA, what did you learn?  I learned that I'm not a patriot because I don't believe everything that Ted Nugent says.  Ted Nugent, yeah.  He's threatening the president and says you're not a patriot if you don't agree with Uncle Ted.  David in South Carolina, what did you learn?  I learned that every time Opie wants his house cleaned, he just turns on a scary movie. 
[03:31:30]  It's genius.  I mean, he knows that his wife is going to go up and do something else, and it's probably going to be cleaning or washing dishes or something.  So it works every time.  Cleaning piss sucks.  Yeah.  She's got to do the laundry, and there's piss all over his socks.  You still think that's gross, right, Eric?  Fucking disgusting.  Yeah.  That, and he doesn't wash his sweatpants.  Yeah, he really should.  I'm glad he stopped wearing those.  Bob in Connecticut, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, boys, I learned that not only does SiriusXM expect you to work for free, but they also expect to own your name. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, well, you know, that was exposed today on the Opie and Anthony show.  What can you say about it?  How come these phone lines are getting X'd out?  I don't know.  Let me check.  Yeah, double check on that.  Ben, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that Shaq really wants to be funny.  Yeah.  That was the way Kevin Hart described him.  He said, because Shaq wants to be funny.  Thank you, Ben.  Kevin in Houston, you're on after Opie and Anthony live. 
[03:32:30]  Hey, guys.  Sam and E-Rock.  It's not that we don't understand and that wrestling is fake.  We all get that.  It's that two grown men talk about it all the time.  Guess what?  Two grown men talk about fucking football and baseball and basketball all the time?  And guess what?  Nobody was talking about it until you called up.  How does that feel?  All right. 
[03:33:00]  John in Tampa, what did you learn?  Sam Roberts.  I learned that Opie's old lady does not do tissues.  Yeah, well, that's kind of what we said before.  Thank you, Jay.  Terry in Orlando.  Yeah, I thought you showed no balls today.  Who?  I wouldn't have interviewed Opie and Anthony and Jim.  This is what we're talking about.  Just because they let you smell a little blood and you get excited for something bad to happen, 
[03:33:30]  why wouldn't, if a movie star on the level of John Cusack comes in here?  But I guess, I guess, I don't like Howard Stern, so I guess he, I think he fucked you too.  He didn't because we still had Cusack for a half hour.  Okay, I just, I thought it was ballless today, but I don't like the show.  It was still a good segment.  It was okay.  I wanted Anthony to ask him about the gun thing too, and didn't have a chance to get to that. 
[03:34:00]  This is what I'm saying.  You guys are all, why don't you just appreciate something that's not based in conflict?  Just say, oh, it's a nice conversation between John Cusack, who's an interesting guy, Opie, Anthony, and Jim.  Just because there was no conflict doesn't mean it was bad.  But I have to be honest, though, that we help you make the show better, that way.  Whatever, Terry.  He sounds like a fake caller.  Yeah, he sounds like the voice that Travis and me do when we're screening calls.  Jeff in Indiana. 
[03:34:30]  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live, dude.  He hung up.  He got very scared when he heard my voice.  That's something that happens when a big star picks up the phone.  Tyler in Minnesota, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned today, man.  What are you laughing at?  I learned today, Sam, that Eggers' teeth are very, very dry.  And this is Irish again.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Very good, Tyler.  Snelly? 
[03:35:00]  Is your name Snelly in Michigan?  Snowy.  Well, the screener wrote Snelly.  Like smelly, except with an N.  Snelly.  Screeners suck.  Yeah.  Snelly, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  First off, wrestling's fake.  Yeah, I know.  We learned a lot of things.  And I learned that ONA fans, some of those guys are fucking sharks, man.  Jesus.  Did you appreciate it?  I love my blood, and it's like a pretty frenzy.  It's insane.  Like, it's like, okay, if it blows up, it'll be fun. 
[03:35:30]  But if it doesn't, it'll still be good.  I'm glad they interviewed you.  I love John Cusack, and I don't want to listen to Howard Sterns.  I wanted to hear, you know, give a good interview on your guys' show.  So I was like, Jesus.  Yeah.  Well, Snowy, I'm glad that you appreciated what we did today.  All right.  Keep talking wrestling, Sam.  No problem.  You see?  People, there are lots of people like Snowy and others.  Guess what?  If you don't like wrestling, not everybody feels the same way as you.  We could do a wrestling show.  I can do a wrestling show anytime I want. 
[03:36:00]  You know why?  It's not because I have a certain amount of power.  It's because nobody who works here listens to this show, so I can literally talk about  whatever I want.  KG in Germany, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, hello, Samuel.  How are you?  Very well, thank you.  Are you really in Germany right now?  Yes, sir.  I'm in the Air Force, and I'm stationed overseas right now.  That's awesome.  You guys listen to us live?  Oh, yeah.  I got you guys on the SiriusXM app for the iPhone.  Love it. 
[03:36:30]  What did you learn on today's show?  Well, I learned today that going supersonic speed in an F-16 Viper really doesn't feel  like that big of a deal.  It doesn't?  No.  Like, you would think that it would slam you back in the seat, but no.  It's just kind of a smooth ride all the way to it.  Wow.  You did that?  Yeah, I did it today.  I got a chance to ride in the F-16 on a familiarization flight.  And you went, wow, Mach 1?  Mach 1. 
[03:37:00]  Actually, Mach 1.2.  That shit is crazy to me.  Like, we just sat here.  That shit is crazy.  We just sat here and waited for John Cusack to come in.  You were driving as fast as somebody could in a plane.  At one point, I was the fastest person in Germany.  You can drive a plane, Eric.  Well, congratulations, KG, and thank you for listening.  Very cool to hear.  Well, thank you for putting on this awesome show after O&A leaves.  You're the man.  Hey, did I win anything?  Yeah.  Do we have a prize? 
[03:37:30]  He's in Germany.  Well, can we send it to somewhere in the States?  Well, you can send it to me in Germany, but it's going to go to an APO address.  It links up just like that.  That counts as American mail.  That's fine.  Okay, cool.  Eric, can we give him something?  Yeah, we'll find something for him.  Do we have anything rolling?  In the Niggle Mansion, yeah.  What is it?  What is it going to be?  Do you have any idea?  No, I've got to look.  We'll find him something really nice.  Is he a good color?  Yeah, he's all the way in Germany, and he flew Mach 1 today.  Do you know what I'm going to do for him? 
[03:38:00]  What?  A John Cusack autographed saying thing poster.  No.  Yes.  You're going to send that to him?  I'll give him one.  Did you hear that, KG?  I did, and I am so ecstatic.  That's amazing.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold.  Make sure you get KG's address.  Not really.  Oh, Roland.  Roland is a fucking dickhead.  He really is.  Well, KG, you son of a bitch.  We'll find him something nice.  We'll find something nice and get a signed wow sticker or something. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, thank you, Samuel.  All right, later.  KG's on hold, so get his information.  Roland, you dirty, rotten son of a bitch.  You had to take out that stress you were feeling of getting John Cusack in here by 9.30.  That's five seconds.  Oh, man.  We got a lot of what did you learn to go through.  I feel bad now.  Should I do it, though?  Should I give it to you?  That's your call.  Larry in Alabama, what did you learn?  I learned prime time, Sammy Sweetheart Roberts.  How are you?  Very well.  How about you?  Well, you got so hosed over to bust it over.  I don't know how you could ever be happy after a hosed job like that. 
[03:39:00]  I mean, you're doing wrestling play-by-play.  You go to ringside at times.  Why the hell don't you have that show?  It's your show.  It's in your wheelhouse.  That's bullshit.  Yeah, I don't know.  What did you learn on today's show?  Well, I learned today that Edgar Allan Poe had a giant cock.  There's lots of things to learn about Edgar Allan Poe.  Thank you, Larry.  Thank you, Sammy.  We appreciate the show.  You're the best.  Sammy, one thing. 
[03:39:30]  Please don't sing.  For God's sakes, don't sing.  You can do everything, but singing ain't one of them.  When you sing along with that song...  All right, Larry.  Larry, shut up, Larry.  I'm going to pick up the hotline now.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Sam.  Yeah.  It's me and Jim.  Hi, guys.  How is a signed wow sticker nice?  What?  People are fans of...  You guys, do you understand that people want your autograph?  I looked at Jimmy.  I go, I won't even take a John Cusack signed wow sticker. 
[03:40:00]  It's a terrible...  It's a horrible gift to leave a listener.  We got something nice for you.  How about a signed wow sticker, you thoughtless asshole?  What a terrible gift.  What else are you guys going to sign?  You don't take pictures.  Look, if you're a fan and you want an autograph, okay, it could be maybe a nice thing.  I don't know.  But if you're giving, you know, a prize to someone, a signed wow sticker, we'll give you  something nice.  Here's a sock I let up come with.  Fucking horrible gift.  It was an impromptu prize. 
[03:40:30]  Damn, I'm going to start giving out piss socks.  That's a prize.  That is a prize and I'll sign the piss sock.  And I will promise you that it was actually used to wipe off pee off the toilet seat.  I promise you that.  Will you bring one in tomorrow for KG in Germany?  Absolutely.  This is great.  And E-Rock sucks for thinking it's gross.  All the things he does, he thinks a piss sock is gross.  Yeah.  What do you think is gross about E-Rock?  It's fucking underwear to begin with. 
[03:41:00]  And the fact that he eats like a fucking piece of shit.  Jesus, Chip.  Yeah, we're driving angry Chip home today.  Oh, what's he so pissed off about?  He's got fucking pig feet.  He eats like a fucking piece of shit.  Chip, lay off.  It's not clever.  It's just fucking mean.  Lay off.  What the fuck would you say that for?  You watch your language, Chip.  You're a fucking asshole a lot of the time.  Fuck you, you piece of shit. 
[03:41:30]  You're a piece of shit.  You're a fucking idiot too.  Watch your language.  My mother's listening.  Yeah, your mother's listening while she's getting fucked by a black guy right now, Chip.  Well, that's not true sometimes.  Most of the time it is.  All right.  Well, I still say a wow sticker is a nice thing.  Now, you guys really built it up to be something that's what we're getting at.  It might be nice, but it's okay.  Well, I'm sorry.  Roland promised him a signed John Cusack poster. 
[03:42:00]  I said, you know what I'm going to do?  And then he said I was joking.  He's an asshole.  Here comes a codependent doorman.  Here's the doorman that has all the more legs.  Wait, wait, you get the ear off.  Hold on.  You got any copies of The Raven yet?  No.  No copies?  Did you get some?  That's the movie I want to see.  You might have one.  Really?  We'll see you on Friday.  I'll have his number. 
[03:42:30]  We'll see you on Friday.  We'll get a nice copy.  I wouldn't even give it to you if it's going to be grainy or chick choppy.  I know that.  It's going to be a little number for the bottle.  Oh, nice.  All right.  Work out.  Usually when I get them, they're nice.  Blockbuster.  Oh, Blockbuster.  Blockbuster doesn't exist anymore.  I can use that.  All right.  See you.  Bye.  Yeah.  I want to see it.  I guess he plays Edgar Allen Paul.  You know, I don't want to go to a theater to see that, so I'd rather just be in my house 
[03:43:00]  because it's illegally.  Why, Edgar?  Take it, come on.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  Bye.  Bye, Opie.  Oh, Edgar's still, that was really funny to me.  Opie just went poor.  I know.  Edgar, why are you still here?  Ken, Ken is dropping me off at the dentist.  Oh, I wish he would drive over you.  I'm going to object at your wedding. 
[03:43:30]  Why?  Because your girl is of lower stock.  Jess is not of lower stock?  I'm home.  You can hang up.  All right.  Goodbye.  Goodbye, Kenny.  Kenny just hit the wrong button to hang up.  What a maroon.  That was vicious.  Hey, Cancer Eyes.  You call me Rock Cancer Eyes?  See.  Tom in Massachusetts. 
[03:44:00]  My dad always...  Tom, does anybody call Massachusetts Massachusetts?  Yeah, sometimes, I guess.  I don't know why.  Usually, what is it called?  Mass?  My dad calls it Massachusetts every time he says it.  Well, your dad's a retard.  He's a fucking idiot.  Tom, what did you learn on the show?  I learned that Edgar's got really dry teeth and he's got pills stuck to him.  That's Edgar Allan Poe and Edgar combined.  That's not true.  No, I thought they were the same person.  No, they're different people, Edgar.  I mean, Tom, you're confusing me now. 
[03:44:30]  Jesus.  Come on, Sam.  I know.  I'm trying to be a professional.  Thank you, Tom.  All right.  All right.  Sam, are you going to come to the screen of the Avengers with us or no?  What time?  4.30.  That's a little late.  Steve in Canada.  Yeah, listen, what's the matter with Chippa's mom getting fucked by a big black guy?  You know, the chicks love the BBC.  And for you guys that don't know all the acronyms out there for the sexual stuff, that's called  big black cock. 
[03:45:00]  Okay?  There's nothing wrong.  All right.  I'm done with him.  Fred in Dallas.  That guy rules.  He was just weird.  I don't know what he's...  Was it a...  Does that count as a prank call?  That's my uncle.  No, that was more legitimate than most of these.  Yeah, you're right.  Fred, what did you learn?  I've learned from Opie that pubic hair means green light.  Have at it, boys.  He did say that.  You're right.  That's a great call.  I had that written down on my page, actually, that pubic hair means you're ready to fuck.  It's time to go.  Nick in Maryland, what did you learn? 
[03:45:30]  Sam, I learned that Ant does not respect you enough to give you an A-list guest.  Like John Cusack?  No respect for the shit show.  Maybe that's what it was.  Thank you, Nick.  Can I have a guest coming soon for the shit show?  I have an A-list guest coming?  To me.  Who?  I can't tell you.  Oh, that's exciting.  Brad in Kentucky.  Yeah, man, I learned Roland is a piece of shit because he promised a serviceman, you  know, a fucking gift, and then he reneged like a fucking bitch.  Come on, Roland.  He's in the Army or the Air Force. 
[03:46:00]  I know he's not in Afghanistan, but give the goddamn serviceman his fucking little shit  present that you promised him.  No, he is in Germany.  You gonna give it to him?  Oh, not that language.  He's a fucking serviceman, Roland.  Not that language, sir.  Please, calm down.  Your mother.  I kissed your mother with his lips.  Andrew in Virginia, what did you learn?  I learned that E-Rock's got cancer in his eyes.  Okay, now we're just playing What Did You Learn on After Open Anthony Live just now.  E-Rock, do you have cancer in your eyeballs? 
[03:46:30]  Not that I was aware of, no.  I hope not.  What's your favorite John Cusack movie?  Better Off Dead.  Better Off Dead.  That's the one, I will say anything, is the one that everybody remembers him for, but  Better Off Dead was the one that sparked all those ski movie parodies.  What's the worst John Cusack movie?  There was a lot of John Cusack movies.  There are some.  I've seen three of his movies, so I don't know.  2012 is terrible.  Oh, right, right.  I forgot about that.  2012 is a horrible movie.  And I'm sure if he were here, he would admit it.  That limo scene was just such bullshit. 
[03:47:00]  It's a completely shitty movie.  You know what his movie is great and underrated, doesn't get brought up enough?  A little film called Identity.  Did you see Identity?  No.  Identity was great.  And if you haven't seen Identity, I would recommend it.  Was it One Crazy Summer he was in?  Or the Wet Hot American Summer he was in?  No One Crazy Summer.  I don't know.  I'm not sure, but I would definitely watch Identity, and there's a little twist at the  end that I enjoyed very much.  The movie, it doesn't go where you think it's going to go. 
[03:47:30]  Unless you're smarter than me, in which case it goes exactly where you think it's going  to go.  A lot of stuff's been going on.  Troy, I'm glad you stopped by, actually.  Troy Kwan is in the house.  What's up, dude?  You got intro music and everything.  I know.  But you, listen, we played, this Carly Rae Jepsen thing is still crazy right now.  I'm still, my shit is still blown up from people from the after show that got it stuck  in their head, and now they're addicted to it. 
[03:48:00]  And I told you people, I said, this is going to happen.  Do not deny yourself.  The song, everybody's like, it's a pop song, fuck this, this is stupid.  But now everybody's all on board.  Everybody is on the nuts of Carly Rae Jepsen.  And I'm finally glad to see that Hits One is playing it, because I was listening to your  show this morning and you played it.  You know what?  First of all, I didn't play it.  Mikey Piff programmed it for me to play.  Well, still.  And second of all, let me tell you, Hits One is running around here trying to be like,  oh, look at the song we broke. 
[03:48:30]  We make a big deal out of it on After Opie and Anthony Live.  We get the Twitter nation, I think that's what they're called, going crazy over this Carly  Rae Jepsen song.  Then all of a sudden, it's in regular rotation again.  Yeah.  Oh, big surprise.  Everybody's on the nuts.  Everybody's on the nuts.  But nobody wants to give credit to After Opie and Anthony Live.  We're working on her to come in.  You are.  Or call in, so you get the credit.  That would be good.  So we can tell her.  We'll bring Piff in here and we'll call bullshit.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  Is Piff here?  Eric, give Mikey Piff a call.  Every time I call him, he never picks up.  Because he doesn't do anything here.  Do the bat signal, the tight t-shirt.  He just listens to whatever's going on on After Opie and Anthony Live, and that's how he programs Hits One.  And I'm just glad I got the picture, because I said, yo, you should stick around for a picture.  And you're like, nah, fuck her.  This is, um, this song sucks.  And now you're all on the nuts.  I didn't realize I was going to break her.  What?  You didn't break her.  And I love how you're taking credit for that.  I did break her.  No, because I'm the one that played the video for you.  And I'm like, dude, this shit is going to be fire this summer. 
[03:49:30]  He did come to the offices.  Yes.  But.  Tiki.  But.  But you did.  And then I listened to your ass on the air.  You don't have a show.  You don't have a show to break it on.  You're like, oh, yeah, I'm the one that did this.  I'm the one that did that.  You can't break it.  You don't have a show.  Walking around the goddamn hallway being like, oh, I broke Carly Rae Jepsen on you.  You came in and said, this is a good song.  And then Sam Roberts made the call to play it 16 times in a row.  And to have it a part of this after Open Anthony Live.  No, I actually recall coming on here and telling everybody that on my Instagram is a picture  of me with Carly Rae Jepsen. 
[03:50:00]  And then you brought it up.  And then that's how it started.  And I said, let's play the song.  Technically, I'm the one that brought it to the show.  You brought the name to the show.  I played the song on the show.  If you're going to get that technical, then Eric's the one that should get credit because  he's the one that played it.  No, because he followed my instructions.  Thank you, Troy.  Yeah, but he's the one back there operating.  Technically, he has to do it.  I'll take the assist, Troy.  Sam's a quarterback.  He's the one that led us.  Thank you, Rowan.  Because, Troy, you have to realize something.  You brought it to the godfather of the whole shit, the emperor. 
[03:50:30]  You brought it to the Mac.  Okay, so give the mother...  It's like a fucking credit.  It's like a Troy bringing something to ONA.  ONA makes it viral.  Right.  Not Troy.  Right.  You made Carly Rae's song viral.  Right.  So go fuck yourself, Troy.  But guess who's got a picture with Carly Rae on the Instagram?  Me.  Well, you can have that.  You're going to get the second generation.  I got first generation Carly Rae Johnson.  That's true.  I'm going to get her after all this, after ONA Live fame.  If you can even get to it.  If you can...  Because right now, there's thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of 
[03:51:00]  after Opie and Anthony Live listeners that are all trying to get at Carly Rae Johnson.  Sam, I forgot this song.  How does it go?  Well, actually, Eric...  Actually, yeah.  Play it for you.  Play it.  Hey, I just...  That's it.  That's the song that we've been talking about.  Crazy.  Right?  Now, this...  This is a masterpiece, is what this is.  It's not what you were saying when you were recording it.  Well, I had a bad day at the time.  This is the version that I wanted to play one more time. 
[03:51:30]  If you didn't hear it yesterday...  Can I ask real quick?  Yeah, of course.  At the end of this, because we've already played this, so it's not a spoiler.  Is that you at the end, or is that Sam?  Sam.  That's Sam?  Yeah.  Troy, when we...  All of the songs that Club Soda Kenny has done, to my knowledge, and if I'm not giving  somebody their credit, make sure I know, but all of the songs that we've done, I feel  like Troy and I have worked very well as a unit and as a team.  Troy is the technical producer, and I is the creative producer.  For instance, if Kenny's off beat, it's all Troy Kwan. 
[03:52:00]  If, you know, making the song actually sound good, it's all Troy Kwan.  But getting him through lyrical content, content, content, is all Sam Roberts.  And we get, when that synergy comes together, boy, you're right.  It's masterpieces that come out.  Yeah.  You and I work very well together.  We do.  When Kenny wants to cooperate, a lot of times Kenny wants to not cooperate in the slightest.  And we work very well together in terms of breaking new artists, breaking new pop songs.  Something that Mikey Piff doesn't know how to do. 
[03:52:30]  Right.  Without us.  Yeah.  Without this show.  That's a nice face.  Hmm?  That's a good face.  What's a good face?  You just trash Mikey Piff.  You like that?  I love that.  Oh, like a face as in you say, like it's a verb.  Or a noun or whatever.  Don't beat me an asshole.  You don't know either, do you?  I don't.  This is the version I wanted to play.  I threw a wish in a well, don't ask me, I'll never tell.  I looked at you as it fell, and now you're in my way. 
[03:53:00]  I trade my soul for a wish.  I trade my soul for a wish, pennies and dimes for a kiss.  I wasn't looking for this, but now you're in my way.  Your stare was holding, ripped jeans, skin was showing.  Hot night, wind was blowing.  Where you think you're going, baby?  Hey, hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but here's my number, so call me, baby.  Hey, it's hard to look right at you, baby.  But here's my number, so call me, baby. 
[03:53:30]  Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but here's my number, so call me, baby.  And all the other boys tried to chase me, but here's my number, so call me, baby.  Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad.  I missed you so bad.  I missed you so, so bad.  Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad. 
[03:54:00]  And you should know that I missed you so, so bad.  Here's where they want me to ad-lib.  Good for them.  Pull my prick.  Pinch my helmet.  This has been another Club Zone Academy production with my man Troy Kwan and primetime Sam Roberts.  Stay tuned for Behind the Music.  We're Club Zoda Kenny.  Club Zoda Kenny on Facebook, y'all. 
[03:54:30]  I'm yelling.  I wasn't yelling.  You weren't.  I mean, it was a masterpiece.  And Troy, your placement of his ad-libs with the music, that's all you, man.  That's artwork.  Now, somebody was on the phone but hung up and said that we're assholes because their girlfriend was listening to this song two weeks ago.  How come nobody was fucking talking about it then?  We didn't say we wrote and recorded the song.  We said we broke it.  Yeah.  I mean, Disney Channel was fucking playing it.  But nobody was talking about it.  No, nobody's talking about it.  Now people are talking about it. 
[03:55:00]  It's kind of like if Hits 1 is one of the biggest music channels on here, if they're not playing it, I mean, is it really on the map yet?  There's a difference between debuting it and actually breaking the song.  Right.  Yeah.  We broke it.  Yeah.  Okay.  We brought it to the masses.  We made this bitch famous.  Yeah.  Here on After Opie and Anthony Life.  You want a Mikey Piff update?  Yeah.  He's not in the office.  I texted him.  I gave him the number.  I said, call in.  And he goes, you're still doing this?  Well, yeah.  Tell Mikey Piff.  And that's the last I heard.  Mikey Piff is just pissed that he's not the one that's going to take care of for it. 
[03:55:30]  He's not the guy who did it this time.  No.  And I'm just so glad that after that happened that other day, we walked around and told everybody.  Everyone.  That this is what's happened.  You guys are asleep at the wheel.  And that's why it's important to mention we didn't break this song for five minutes on After Opie and Anthony Live.  We did it for 40 minutes.  There is no mistaking what happened on this show.  And we're still doing it a week later.  Yeah.  And I'm still getting the tweets from that 45 minutes last week.  That's right.  That's right.  We had a whole F.U. line thing promo full of F.U.s for that song. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  Well, it's good.  I'm glad to see it blown up.  I'm glad to see hits.  One is finally on board.  Yeah, exactly.  Way to be late to the party.  Yeah.  Hits one.  Better late than never, though.  You, though.  I mean, I got to tell you guys.  I've told you before.  Remember when we did Bobo Man, which I would play right now, but I actually want to have some time to talk.  Bobo Man.  I brought Bobo into Troy's studio for it.  And Troy couldn't have been less happy. 
[03:56:30]  He was tortured while Bobo was in there.  He hated every minute of it.  When I brought Kenny into Troy's studio a couple days ago to record that song, that was the Troy I got.  You Bobo'd Club Soda Kenny.  Because Club Soda comes in and he just, he's like a diva.  You know what I mean?  Like, he wants things done his way.  He doesn't want to cooperate.  He doesn't even want to listen to the song beforehand to do a little bit of homework.  And that's fine.  But, you know, there's just some days that I'm just not, I'm not feeling it.  You know what I mean?  I just want to get the job done. 
[03:57:00]  You know, with Kenny, it's playtime all the time.  You know what?  This is, and this, you have to be in that zone.  I don't like that you decide to be in your mood sometimes.  Sometimes you're cranky.  Sometimes you don't want to play.  And I understand that, but sometimes there's a lot on my plate that I have to figure out.  Like, I'm putting together a new intro for the show.  That's a lot of work.  And you have to literally take all these parts and put them together in your head.  Put it to the side.  This is Carly Rae Jepsen.  We're talking about breaking new artists.  No, I understand, but while I'm working on Club Soda Kenny singing a song, I'm working on 20 different things. 
[03:57:30]  Well, why don't you let this, when Club Soda Kenny and me are in there.  This is just to clean the palette.  Doing something creative.  This is a vacation for you.  And if somebody walks back there, like, I spent, whatever, we took 45 minutes to record that song.  I didn't have to be in here pretending I know how to Google for 45 minutes.  Because I was back there in your studio recording the song.  Vacation.  That's what it is.  You shouldn't be crabby about the fact that you have to do a show intro when you're not doing the show intro. 
[03:58:00]  No, I know, but I'm still trying to put it together in my head.  That's why.  I need you focused, Troy.  From now on, I need you focused on the task at hand.  I don't believe in multitasking.  You know who multitasks?  Who?  People who are not focused.  And that's why shit gets done wrong.  No, no, no.  You ever see me multitask?  You do multiple things.  Never.  I like that Eric just tweeted that, let Mikey Piff know who on Sirius XM broke Carly Rae Jepsen.  So people can tweet him?  Yeah.  Let him know.  Because he's trying to dodge this bullet. 
[03:58:30]  He is.  Mikey Piff, step up to the plate, man.  You fucked up.  You fucked up this time.  You know what I mean?  Like, he's all, he was bragging around here that hits one broke one direction.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry, you missed the boat on Carly Rae Jepsen while you were focused on that.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You picked the wrong raft.  Right.  Sorry.  Sorry.  You know, sorry.  We were, we had our ear to the street.  Troy picked up on this because he's a club DJ and he knows what's hot.  And then he presented what's hot to me.  I said, I don't know for sure yet. 
[03:59:00]  Let's play it 16 times in a row live on the radio.  And by the eighth time, I was down.  Everybody was down.  Everyone.  Roland was downloading it.  Yeah.  Travis came in here saying that he's now a fan.  And that's another thing.  I think I deserve, and maybe I'll get you Wendy's with some of them.  I deserve some money.  From who?  Carly Rae Jepsen.  Well, you're gonna have to bring that up with her.  I will.  Because I get tweets from ONA fans and after Opie and Anthony live fans who are tweeting  me with pictures of their little iPhone screens that says, now listening to Carly Rae Jepsen. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  Everybody's on board.  I told you.  I told you.  I got Carly Rae those dollars.  Don't deny that song.  Just crank it up and enjoy it.  Windows down.  It's a feel good song.  It's a feel good song of the summer.  People are feedbacking in.  This guy Frank in New Jersey.  What's Frank having to say?  He wants Kenny's version downloadable.  He loves it.  I'm sure people put shit right out on YouTube.  Yeah.  I mean, all you got to do is record the show and cut my part of it out.  Yeah.  I've been trying to tell Opie to play this song and he was going to yesterday and today, 
[04:00:00]  but he just didn't get around to it because, you know, Opie and Anthony actually do a real  show.  They got a lot of shit going on.  Right.  But I told him, the feedback on this is big and you guys got to be down with this Carly  Rae Jepsen revolution that was started on after Opie and Anthony live.  See, I don't think they want that though.  Why not?  Well, because it's like, you know, it's, it's spotlighting, you know, you're coming  to your show.  You know, they refer to the show as the shit show.  Well, you know what?  First of all, they don't. 
[04:00:30]  Opie made it clear that that's, he does not.  He said that today as he was leaving.  He said, I don't refer to it as the shit show because he's smart enough to realize that  implies that Opie and Anthony have decided to put something shit quality on their channel  to follow their show.  Doesn't make them exactly look like geniuses.  Well, yeah.  I hear that from that perspective.  So, I mean, Anthony and Jim, I'm sure it's still refer to it that way, but it's not the  correct name.  Right.  I know that.  And this is the show and the voice of a new generation. 
[04:01:00]  You know, we're talking to the kids.  We're talking to the youth of America and by youth of America, I mean, 40 year old truck  drivers who listen to Carly Rae Jepsen.  Yeah.  That's who we're talking to.  That's funny.  I think you should do a new music segment every week.  You think so?  I think you should.  And you could come in and help me out with that and let me know what the girls are dancing to  and stuff.  I'm telling you, man, there's, there's a couple of hip hop  tracks right now that are really hot.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  It's not pop.  You know what I mean?  It's not easily accessible as, as Carly Rae Jepsen, but.  Yeah.  And the hip hop thing.  A lot of the listeners are very racist.  So that would be, that's a little bit of a tougher sell.  Well, that's fine.  And I can explain it. 
[04:01:30]  Like, look, you know, if you don't like hip hop, but who knows, maybe I'll be able to turn  people on to hip hop that don't understand it.  There's lots of things to look forward to.  Not only tomorrow, but today.  Ron and Fez are coming up next, for instance.  Stay tuned for that.  And we'll be back with more of this tomorrow when Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony  live continue.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O and A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern. 
[04:02:00]  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. </pre>
