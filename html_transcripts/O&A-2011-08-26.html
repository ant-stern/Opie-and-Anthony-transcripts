<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about Hurricane Irene's projected path and impact, with Opie expressing skepticism about its severity in Manhattan while focusing on unusually strong winds in his neighborhood.  This led to humorous anecdotes about co-worker Eric's selfish desire to leave for vacation despite his wife's flight being threatened by the hurricane.  The hosts then discussed their own vacation plans, including a cruise, and the potential for hurricane-related disruptions.  Further tangential topics included power outages affecting the broadcast, E-Rock's vacation plans, a text message detailing another friend's hurricane anxieties, and a bizarre story about a foot-kissing incident at a library, all punctuated by off-color humor. The segment concluded with a satirical reading of a John Sterling Yankee's game call, mocking his self-promotion.

The show continued with a deeper dive into John Sterling's catchphrases, particularly his overuse of "The Grandy Man can," leading to a somber discussion about the suicide of Orioles broadcaster Mike Flanagan.  The hosts debated the effectiveness of Sterling's home run calls and his nicknames for players. This segued into a hyperbolic discussion about Randy Johnson, followed by a further discussion of Hurricane Irene and Mayor Bloomberg's perceived overreaction.  Their favorite movies, including "Jaws," "Shawshank Redemption," "Goodfellas," and "Crash," were discussed, with a lengthy and contentious debate on "Crash's" portrayal of race relations.  Ron Bennington, a guest from "The Ron and Fez Show," joined the conversation, discussing a past guest's lack of an ass and the ease of getting on their show.  Fez's hurricane anxieties and a clip of a previous earthquake during a broadcast were also featured.  The segment ended with a discussion of infomercial products, notably the "Comfort Wipe" toilet paper dispenser.

A significant portion of the show focused on a movie discussion featuring Opie, Anthony, Ron Bennington, and guest comedian Mike Paschetti.  They engaged in a profane analysis of the Coen Brothers' films and *Crash*, covering their perceived strengths and weaknesses, and relating them to various social issues.  The conversation included anecdotes about their personal lives, including dating, sexual experiences, drug and alcohol use, and a comparison of past and present societal changes.  Mike Paschetti shared an embarrassing story about a hooker at a comedy club.  The "FU Line" segment featured numerous listener-submitted profane messages.

The show further explored several loosely connected topics, including reminiscing about the differences between past and present air travel, anxieties about airplane takeoffs and landings, a discussion about a plane flying upside down, and a racially charged discussion about lawn jockeys.  The conversation shifted to childhood allergies, particularly peanut allergies, old cigarette commercials, changing societal attitudes towards advertising, and the infantilization of adults.  The hosts shared personal experiences with alcohol and their behavior while intoxicated, contrasted their younger and current views on relationships, and shared anecdotes about past relationships.  A Steven Singer Jewelers commercial was interspersed with casual conversation about their personal lives, including a wedding prank, family gatherings, and Opie's impending hurricane evacuation.  The segment concluded with a discussion of celebrity crushes, including explicit descriptions of sexual fantasies.

A segment heavily featuring sexually explicit discussions about the hosts' and Mike's sexual experiences and preferences dominated a portion of the broadcast.  Mike detailed sexual encounters with younger women, focusing on oral sex.  The hosts engaged in a humorous exchange about euphemisms for oral sex. The conversation then shifted to criticism of a Martin Luther King Jr. statue, its design, its production in China, and the King family's fee.  Hurricane Irene and its potential impact on their vacations was also discussed.  A contest to find a date for Bobo, featuring a phone interview with Bobo detailing his ideal woman in crude terms, concluded this section, followed by promotion of other Sirius XM shows.

The final segment centered on the Bobo date contest, discussing strategies to attract more contestants and contrasting Bobo's self-perception with the public's perception.  Bobo shared details about his personal life, including his dogs, dating goals, and unusual masturbatory practices.  The hosts joked extensively about Bobo's penis size and sexual prowess. The conversation also included a brief discussion of Troy's birthday celebration, his DJ set, a new music mix, Paul's departure from the show, and Ron's upcoming show.

[00:00:00]  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  You get it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to a show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony Radio Show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  What are we?  Hi, everybody.  Batting down the hatches.  Batting down the hatches.  Oh, my goodness.  You know, there are a lot of people all over the country that don't even give a shit.  I'm just sitting here thinking everybody's super involved in the Hurricane Irene that's working its way up the east coast.  But, you know, if you're kind of west of the coastal area, who gives a shit? 
[00:04:30]  And it's just like, oh, great.  But, boy, is everybody fully involved here.  You can't pass anybody in the hallways or at a store with somebody you basically don't even know.  They'll come up and be like, hey, Hurricane, huh?  Hey, what about the hurricane?  You ready?  You ready for the...  Shut up. 
[00:05:00]  Who cares?  I'm in the middle.  Well, I'm supposedly, as they're tracking it, which I know it's just going to take this ridiculous turn to the right and over the ocean and give us nothing.  That's my course that I'm plotting.  My fucking model, my computer models have said that it's going to take a hard right and all the people on the news are going to go, well, we dodged that bullet. 
[00:05:30]  By the way, why is Bloomberg saying that...  Where are they going to evacuate?  Is he looking in Long Island or something?  He's going to evacuate in his pants.  Yeah.  Apparently a Republican did something wrong.  Yes.  Phony he is.  He really is an ass.  I don't know.  They want people to evacuate to where?  Brooklyn?  Where are you going?  There's going to be no mass transit, he said.  Mass transit's shut down from Saturday until probably early Monday.  Just nothing.  No subways, buses, things like that.  So if you're not somewhere, you're going to have to hunker down. 
[00:06:00]  But I don't think Manhattan is a place that really gets affected by fucking hurricanes.  Right.  You might get some busted windows and shit that you've got to watch out for.  In my building?  South Southern guy.  But it's like, fucking concrete, big buildings and shit.  It's not like a beach house in the Hamptons or something.  I am on, I'm not going to say exactly what block, but please, real fans know.  Oh, of course.  But my block is extraordinarily windy. 
[00:06:30]  I mean, like on a regular day, 30 mile an hour, it's a weird wind tunnel, my block.  They fucked that up where they built the buildings and didn't quite run it through the wind tunnel.  It's not far from the West Side Highway.  So the way it comes off the river and it just, thank God my windows face a back courtyard and not the actual river because it's brutal.  So my block might be annoying, but it's a fucking massive building.  If it falls over, we're in deep trouble as a city. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, exactly.  How fucked up is it in, do you have to walk on that road at all in the winter?  In the winter, in the winter, it's got to be like you can't even, like it sucks the breath right out of you.  There are times where I'm walking down my block because I like to, I've been trying to do the elliptical more.  Ah, the elliptical, yeah.  I just want to do all like self-centered tangents.  You know what I mean?  It's all about jeezing.  You're coming down sometimes on, it is, you have to lean into it.  Oh, no.  You have to lean into the wind or you're going to get blown over. 
[00:07:30]  And what about ice?  Like if it's icy, are you slipping and sliding?  No, I haven't.  That just sounds horrid.  It's very, very bad.  But a lot of times, Opie's on, we live across the streets from each other.  Yes.  So he knows the block too because his entrance is very close, so.  Oh, I hate that.  It's a nightmare to deal with, but Kenny knows.  Why am I keeping people who know?  There's thousands of people who know.  Pesada knows.  I know. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And look at him, he's picking up his hat because the wind blew it off.  Of all the traumatic breezes.  Who's going to be up at Jimmy's box?  Yeah.  Well, actually, whose box is Jimmy going to be in?  Yeah, I was holding a piece of paper, but it blew out of my hand.  I'll be picking it up real soon.  Fucking Ted Shuckler.  She sucks.  She really does just suck a big one.  But I'm just naming people who have been on my own.  Who fucking cares?  They've experienced the wind. 
[00:08:30]  I'm acting like it's the fucking red spot on Jupiter.  I'm a fool.  Well, the hurricane could, yeah, make it really, really windy there.  A couple miles an hour worse for me than everybody else.  Instead of 118, it's 122.  Is that what it is on a normal basis?  Yeah.  Just 118 mile an hour wind?  But there are times it's fucking brutal.  Yeah, I can't take that, especially in the winter.  I'm happy I'm not facing the fucking... 
[00:09:00]  It's fun to repeat myself again.  I'm self-centered and repeat myself.  That's fine.  You're right, though.  Mars knows.  I was there once, and it was very windy.  Thank you.  You know, it's funny, but nobody's backing me up.  I didn't hear fucking E-Rock, who spent more time there than God knows what.  You can't think of an example.  He spent more time there than whatever.  God's like, I don't know.  Yeah, God's like, I don't know.  I just don't know where E-Rock goes.  Not a clue.  I know he's certainly not helping the show.  I don't know where he is.  I'm not kidding.  Oh, wow.  I'm teasing.  Not too far in.  I love E-Rock.  Not too far in.  You get your luggage with you?  He's in vacation mode, man.  Yes, he is.  Yeah, I do.  He's actually sipping a daiquiri.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Are you going to Florida?  Why would you go where you were fucking born and raised?  He's just going home.  I was born and raised on Long Island.  Bullshit.  But my parents live down in Florida.  That's like another.  I hate when they name places Long Island, like in Florida.  Yes.  Because it's like Long Island.  There already is a Long Island.  It's like, you know, a Washington, and it's somewhere else.  Yeah.  Things like that.  There's a Long Island, Florida.  Where is that?  Northern?  I mean, Eastern or Western?  Probably the Panhandle, right?  There's a Panhandle?  That would be Eastern, South Florida, West Palm Beach. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, okay.  And that's where Long Island is?  No.  Long Island is up here in New York.  Pretty cool, huh?  Pretty cool.  That's where he parks the boat, anyway.  Parks the boat.  He's going with your wife, obviously.  You're going to see your parents?  Yeah.  But my wife's flying down tomorrow, not today.  Those separate flights like the Obamas.  Trump.  Yes.  Why?  Because she has to work today.  Oh, okay.  So you wouldn't wait for your wife?  I love Eric.  He wants to go home now.  He don't want to be fucking...  You want to be down there on the Coke float? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Now, if she's flying out tomorrow, can't there be maybe a weather problem or issue?  Originally, she was supposed to fly Sunday morning, but that switches to yesterday afternoon.  Well, the hurricane's very unpredictable, especially speed, with these things travel.  They can get caught up and travel very quickly and then cut her off for this Saturday flight,  Iraq.  Iraq wants to make sure his vacation isn't spoiled.  Of course.  Iraq wants it easy to leave her stuck here in this way. 
[00:11:00]  And then have to fly through a hurricane.  She's going to be in the airport for hours.  He's not going to care.  He's going to be at home with chocolate milk and BLTs.  Oh, yeah.  And a big fucking steak martini.  Oh, yeah.  His mom makes a steak martini.  Iraq is a big child.  Yeah.  He's selfish.  You're married.  Of course he's not.  I want to go.  I want to go now.  What am I going to do?  Are we both going to sit here and have our vacation ruined?  Yeah.  I can picture that argument because she's probably like, we're married now.  Yeah.  And he's probably standing there in his shorts, fucking Cam's McGillicuddy. 
[00:11:30]  But why should both of our vacations be ruined?  His shoulders are slumped and he keeps sucking his teeth going.  And I want to.  I just want to see my parents, you know, they're getting up there.  Yeah.  Like it's not selfish.  No, but meanwhile, the whole time he's down there, while she's sitting in the airport,  he'll be playing with his wrestling figures on the beach.  Yeah.  He'll be dragging the Hulk's feet through the sand. 
[00:12:00]  Not having any real storyline.  No.  Just in the sand.  Making whisking noises.  Yes.  And his wife is listening, too.  American Airlines Flight 36 dial.  There'll be more delays.  We're not looking.  I think the flight is now canceled.  We will give you vouchers for food and hotel here at the airport.  But she can't get out of the airport because the hurricane's already hitting,  so you can't drive in it.  You're welcome to sleep on these comfortable, comfortable seats 
[00:12:30]  that, of course, have a metal armrest like a steel girder  that you can't possibly get comfortable all the way down on.  Thank you.  Are you worried about that, Eric?  It is a concern, yes.  No, it's not.  Not for you.  Why can't she fly out tonight?  Because she couldn't get off for today.  Oh.  They wouldn't give her off?  That's terrible.  It's summer Friday.  Yeah.  Today's the last summer Friday.  Come on.  We got an email.  What the hell?  Nope.  She's flying tomorrow.  Why was she going to fly Sunday? 
[00:13:00]  She had some stuff she wanted to do this weekend.  I was going down to see.  Beat away from you.  You know what?  This may be her.  Let me let her off.  This may be her call.  Let's just say there may be an African-American salesman who there has to be a meeting with.  Oh, my God.  She's had enough of him.  It always goes there, doesn't it?  It's just as a guy, it's the thing that you dread the most.  Oh, of course.  You don't want your wife, maybe.  So, no, listen.  She's a lovely girl.  I wouldn't want that for – I would want that for her, only if it made her happy.  Right. 
[00:13:30]  It would be funny to have Eric come back and realize that.  Oh, it would be terrible for him to come back and realize that.  When did she want to spend time at the Nagel compound?  Yeah, what did she want to do that was different?  All right.  We're going on a cruise on Sunday.  So, she's flying directly.  She booked her flight through the cruise line to fly there.  So, it's guaranteed.  Like, if her flight got delayed or whatever, she wouldn't – the ship doesn't leave.  It's something Royal Caribbean does.  Oh, Royal Caribbean.  So, everybody has to wait for one American Airlines flight out of LaGuardia? 
[00:14:00]  No, if you book your flights through the cruise line, you have to wait for everybody to get there.  If it's not weather delay from, like, a hurricane or something.  But, like, if the flight broke down or if there was some other kind of delay –  If there's a five-hour delay.  Then it's supposed to be guaranteed that you'll make the ship and the ship won't leave without you.  If they book through –  If you book through the cruise line.  The cruise line.  Now, let me ask you.  The cruise line must have a contingency plan if there's a real issue.  And I guarantee you they say delays are six hours or more not counted. 
[00:14:30]  And they're going to fly you in eight hours before.  So, they're really not – they're not waiting for me next time.  Yeah, they wouldn't be waiting.  I've never had to wait for a flight to come in.  Well, they wouldn't tell you that's what it was.  Because then the people that got on the boat, you want to cut the throat.  I've never even been delayed leaving, like, more than a few minutes.  If she'd flown down on Friday night and the cruise leaves on Sunday, she wouldn't have to worry about being late.  Right.  Well, when all this was booked, there was no fucking hurricane involved where this was going to be a problem.  Oh, wow.  Well, now, let me ask you.  She couldn't get a flight.  This is a Friday night flight. 
[00:15:00]  She couldn't get a flight from Friday.  Yeah, the two of you.  She didn't want to leave Friday.  Because she has a hair appointment and all this other shit that she's –  A hair – she's going on a boat.  I don't fucking know.  There's beauty salons.  You had this argument already.  Yeah, she doesn't want to come to the party.  You know, there's salons on the ship.  Yeah, there's salons on the ship.  Beauty salons.  Salon.com or something.  No, Chip.  On the ship.  What's that?  Yeah, I'm a Royal Caribbean.  So she's – this is amazing to me.  So they're going to take separate vacations – like separate trips down. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  With her maybe missing.  I understand Eric, though.  I can't even make fun of him because I think that Eric just wanted to get down to Treatsville sooner.  Treatsville?  I understand that.  Treatsville.  Where's the first port?  Coco Cay in the Bahamas.  Bahamas?  Yeah.  That'll be nice.  You'll be fucking kicking palm leaves all over the beach.  Yeah.  Great.  Well, if she does miss, then she's got to fly down to the first port and meet you.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  We already talked about that.  What?  If it gets to that, she ain't doing it?  She goes, fuck that. 
[00:16:00]  I'm not doing that.  So you'd just be on the cruise by yourself?  It was hard enough to convince her to try to go on the cruise to begin with because she didn't want to.  Why?  She's like – she has this weird thing that she thinks she's afraid of being on boats.  Doesn't she know you –  She thinks she's afraid of being on – no, you're either afraid or not you think she thinks.  She's never been on.  Well, maybe she has a fear of boats.  Maybe her desire to throw you into the ocean will be overwhelming.  Doesn't she know your diamond status?  Yeah, really.  Does he have diamond status?  Yeah, of course. 
[00:16:30]  He's Mr. Cruise Line.  You've been on a lot of cruises, right?  I got upgraded and everything.  I love it.  I think Iraq would be a fun guy to go on a cruise with.  It would be.  Did you hear –  As long as they put him on the right part of the boat, either side, you know.  Do you remember –  Do you remember what his cruise pastime is?  That he goes to his room –  Eating?  Yeah.  He goes to his room at like 2 o'clock in the morning after everything's closed, and then he orders BLTs and chocolate milk and watches Snow Dogs.  What is Snow Dogs?  With Cuba Gooding Jr.  That's a movie. 
[00:17:00]  That's his cruise thing.  Yeah, they run these shitty movies on that in-house channel for the rooms.  So the last cruise or one that comes to mind is that when the casino closed, everything else closed, you'd stumble back to the room.  You know, you're kind of drunk.  You order room service.  And that movie was always fucking on, so I just watched it every night.  So let me ask you, would you order – do you think you're going to eat healthy on the cruise?  Fuck no.  So I already booked restaurant reservations, and it's going to be great.  I like putting on the – I just put on the Bowcam channel, and I sit there all night going, what's that? 
[00:17:30]  Look out!  No, look!  Look out!  Turn!  Fucking pointless.  What, the Bowcam?  Yeah.  Love the Bowcam.  Yeah, I know, but –  Especially at night, you look and just go, what the fuck's out there?  There's monsters out there, and they don't know.  Big, giant monsters.  I have nothing to do this week.  Like, I wanted to go to a spa.  Yeah?  I'm like, I'm not going to go to a spa myself.  I don't have nobody to go with.  I don't know.  Go on a cruise there.  Yeah, you should go to Florida.  I don't have time to book it, or I would. 
[00:18:00]  I'd go on a cruise with you, but not with his wife, that's their thing together.  How long are you going for?  It's seven days.  Nice.  Are you coming back Sunday?  Nice.  Yeah, coming back Sunday.  Royal Caribbean.  So you're just going to come back, give me a work of it.  Yeah, but his wife's not going to go on the cruise.  She's going to pretend that there's no flights.  Yeah.  Because she's stuck in a bedroom with him?  She's going to let Eric fly, and then she's not even going to get on a plane.  She's going to be like, yeah, I'm sorry, everything's delayed.  You go on the cruise by yourself.  I'm afraid of –  Like, I love Lucy.  They're going to be dropping her from a helicopter.  Do you think she already has plans for next week? 
[00:18:30]  Of course she does.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's already got plans.  She's going to a spa.  It's not Eric.  She just doesn't like boats.  Oh, yeah.  She doesn't like boats.  I don't know what to do with my time off.  I literally – like, it's not even last minute.  I just have no one to go anywhere with.  Come over.  I know I'm going to be seeing my friends, Anthony and whoever friends go over Anthony's,  but now the hurricane might wreck our flight plans.  Oh, that's going to – well, you know what?  I don't know.  Here's the biggest problem is –  Our hard ones?  Yes. 
[00:19:00]  Our boners.  Wrestling with our erections before the match begins?  If there's an outage of Verizon, of Fios, then it's beyond my control.  Yeah, that's –  I'm getting a giant generator.  I will have power at the compound.  There will be a hurricane compound show.  Don't worry.  But, you know, if Fios fucking peters out, you know, if a fucking tree falls on the cables 
[00:19:30]  and shit –  Yeah, that could happen in Manhattan, too.  Then – then you can't see anything.  You know, it's one of those – then you're just watching videos.  Well, you can go on the computer and you get it.  You think?  But then again, Fios is how you do your computer.  Yeah, yeah, because again –  It's underground.  Again, well –  Fios underground?  Well –  Yeah, but when it's a Fios station, it gets like a boat or something blown into it.  That's true.  Now, if Fios goes down for some reason –  Or gets a boat blown into it.  Then there's an issue.  Although I could –  I could hook it up to my satellite phone and run the internet off the satellite. 
[00:20:00]  I bet you that your charger cord is so long.  No, no.  See, it's –  Because you've got to go up in space.  It's not up in space, Chip.  It's like a planet or something.  I will find a way to find a way to watch that fight.  And doing it through the satellite phone is probably cost effective.  Oh, that's very –  To get data off the satellite phone for an entire broadcast of a UFC fight could probably cost a little bit of money. 
[00:20:30]  I've told Anthony I'm insisting on paying for this fight.  For this one.  That's $11,632.  No, for the actual fight.  I'm going to bring some treats, too.  I can't just go to Ann's house and take –  Jimmy, I love hosting at my house.  I know, but I feel bad.  I always go to Ann's.  You don't always want to go and take.  No.  It's not a money issue, friend.  You give with your company and your fun and your bunghole.  It's true.  My mouth and asshole really are.  It's open season. 
[00:21:00]  Just put out.  You don't need to pay for it.  For any guests.  And I'm thinking of perhaps Hurricane Pool Party.  How fun would it be –  To have something blown into your skull as you're lounging in luxury.  How fun would it be to be paralyzed in a lovely jacuzzi and no one helps you because it's lightning.  But to try to be in a pool that would be heated to 85 degrees and try to swim around in what could be 100-mile-an-hour winds.  What if there's trees falling?  That's what's scary. 
[00:21:30]  I cut all the fucking trees down.  For the party?  No, for all those dead trees and shit.  They're gone.  There's none over the pool.  They're all on a perimeter and way over to the side.  So I'm thinking at least a dip in the pool might be a little fun in a hurricane.  I'm scared of lightning.  Eye of the storm.  You're fucking swimming around and then the next one part comes like whoosh.  The water's blowing out of the pool.  It'd be like you're on the fucking high seas.  How fun?  The one guy who died in a hurricane in a wet bathing suit.  Like, what was he doing?  That would be the story where people would read and be like, what an asshole. 
[00:22:00]  Shock him.  What a fucking dick.  Shock drop dies in his pool.  Every radio show is making jokes and goofing like we would.  Of course.  That is an awful idea.  But after a couple of beers, I'll probably do it.  But I'm like, because I don't want to ride out into the epicenter.  It is supposedly where the strongest and the center part of the storm will cross over is  right at the Nassau County line there. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, if you go out Saturday night, I would probably plan on staying there on Sunday.  You would be staying, yeah.  There's no way of leaving at that point.  Late Saturday night?  No, because that's when it's supposed to start.  Saturday until Sunday morning.  And then Sunday is supposed to get nice later on in the day.  Really?  Yeah.  That's how hurricanes work.  And then the sun comes out and then you go and assess your damage.  Oh, so it's only going to go, it's not going to be like two days?  No, they move pretty quick.  It's like Saturday night into Sunday.  I don't know.  That was another little kid question. 
[00:23:00]  I really mentioned it.  Is this going to be forever?  I'm thinking this could be like two or three days of fucking horrible.  No, no.  It'll be a day at most.  It moves pretty quick.  I'm supposed to drive back from New Hampshire to New York on Sunday.  Oh, really?  I'm kind of making plans for that not to happen.  But that is where it's moving.  I know.  It's not like you're pulling an E-Rock, which is like the storm passes Florida.  Florida gets in between.  He gets over it with the plane.  Right. 
[00:23:30]  And then lands in Florida.  He's hunky-dory and everybody else, including his wife, gets fucking stuck in the storm.  Yeah.  Well.  But in New York, I'm sorry, Sam, things are always open in Manhattan.  The thing that's cool, there's a Rite Aid up the street.  There's a fucking store here or there.  Worst case scenario, you can always go out and get shit in this city.  I love the city.  Are you going to go out in the midst of a hurricane and get something?  No, no, no.  But I mean, it's a...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All I'm saying is I want to try to put Foundry logos in the air so the wind blows them on things to the four corners. 
[00:24:00]  I should get food.  I have nothing in my house.  Well, yeah.  See, that's what I'm saying.  Like, anybody that would seek shit.  I know Keith, Keith the cop.  First of all, he's got to work.  And Ange, his wife, it's her first hurricane.  And she's freaking out.  It's her first hurricane?  And, yeah.  What does she do every year?  She's had hurricanes come through before. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, but she never lived.  She was living in, like, Ohio or some shit.  They don't have bad weather out there?  Well, they don't have hurricanes.  Hurricanes are only, you know, ocean-based.  So, you know, hurricanes don't make it too far inland.  That makes sense.  But literally, if you would have said to me that she had a lot of Kansas hurricanes, I would have said, like, poor girl.  I get those tornadoes.  Yeah, right.  But not your hurricanes.  Hurricanes need warm water.  But I got this text from her moments ago. 
[00:25:00]  And this is, you know, yeah.  Anthony, your underwear is on the bed.  Why is there cum in the back of it?  I'm leaving.  She's seen worse in that bed, believe me.  She's been cleaning and taking care of my house for many years.  And she's seen horror shows.  She's seen a bed that probably looked like Lizzie Borden's parents.  I had to go back to the 1800s for a joke.  Still going.  You could have said Bundy, but you didn't want to go with the Hacky OJ one.  I respect the Lizzie Borden reference. 
[00:25:30]  Lizzie Borden.  Here's the text I just got.  Since Keith will be stuck in the city, because Keith being a law enforcement officer, he's, you know, they call in, calling all cars, calling all cars.  I'm sick with worry.  I'll probably come to your house Saturday morning.  I'll have, and then this is the part that gets me.  I'll have the kids, which is fine, and pets.  But don't worry, they will behave.  Now, where are the pets? 
[00:26:00]  How many are there?  Which, what are they, I know the dog, but what else?  I'm a cat.  A cat.  Yeah.  Now, do you mind if I interject here?  Please do.  Because last night, I got an invitation from the same person inviting us to go to their house.  To their house.  In case we get evacuated.  Because there's a really strong possibility we're going to be evacuated.  You're on the fucking water, of course you're getting evacuated.  So, I got a text. 
[00:26:30]  They're on the water, they're getting evacuated.  I got a text saying, hey, if you guys get evacuated, you can come ride it out at our house.  Well, they're riding it out at my house.  So, you would be riding it out at my house.  I'm trying to think of what would make me happier than if Travis' dog ripped up and shit on something Anthony loves.  Like, I'm sorry about your 50 cal, my fucking, my dog with sleep apnea shit down the barrel.  No, this would be the most horrible thing. 
[00:27:00]  Walking into the theater and seeing the cat had shredded my screen.  Oh!  And pissed on your favorite captain seat.  And just pissed all over, like, every seat in the theater.  You're trying to watch Gladiator, there's claw marks in the bottom.  Cat frightened.  Just smells like piss all over the place.  Oh, you're fucking pissed all over the fucking wires on your karaoke machine.  Right?  Joy that would give me.  And then it wouldn't come out of somewhere.  We'd spend hours going, psst, psst, psst. 
[00:27:30]  And it's just hissing at us.  Yeah, and meanwhile, you see it defecating into your Guinness keg.  But a frightened liquidy cat shit.  Just leaking into your Guinness.  See, that's the only thing I'm worried about.  It's like animals, during a storm, they're known to fucking freak out during storms.  So, I'm fine with it.  Look, I'm a good guy.  You're not a good guy. 
[00:28:00]  But, no, I'm a terrible guy.  But here's the deal.  The animals, during the duration of the storm, must be locked in the master bathroom.  Which is all tile.  And it's nothing they could fuck up.  Except kill each other.  If they shit all over the floor or anything, that can be cleaned up.  Except for Dexter.  He can hang out with us.  No, Dexter.  That fucking smelly monster with his non-breathing.  Keep him outside.  Exactly.  Do you like that?  Yeah, put him in the pool.  He can swim in a hurricane. 
[00:28:30]  Doggy paddle.  He can stay in the cabana.  In the pool house.  Should I tape my windows?  Or in Danny's room.  Should I tape my windows?  No, the tape doesn't do anything.  That's what they say.  The mask.  If wind's going to break a window, masking tape ain't going to help.  Have you seen Danny?  Danny is in San Francisco.  He's in San Fran.  Oh.  He posted some pictures.  He went to the...  Oh, fuck.  He went to the compound.  Yeah, he went over to the Mythbusters place. 
[00:29:00]  Did he like it?  Yeah, of course.  How great would it be to see Travis's dog, little Dexter the French Bulldog, just blowing  around in the sky?  Just fucking up in the air and then just lose sight of it?  Yeah.  It's like, well, your dog's gone.  I don't know where it went.  Exactly.  He'll stay with me.  It's fucking...  It's sneaky.  I would say that would be the best scenario after fucking vacation.  Yeah.  Where the dog is tied to the bumper and they don't realize it?  Oh, fuck.  Yes.  Yes.  I don't hear the dog struggling for breath. 
[00:29:30]  The dog will prop a bone up in its mouth so it can breathe, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, they'll do that like...  That was him sleeping the other night.  What an asshole.  Oh, that looks like a dog that doesn't have much slime that drips from its mouth and gets  all over everything.  He doesn't.  No?  Why do they have that fucked up nose and mouth?  How do the dogs have that?  They're inbred.  Are they inbred?  Probably.  They make them just so they're cute pets, right?  But half dog, half head of Nussbaum.  He's been around for hundreds of years.  What's that?  They've been around for hundreds of years.  Well, not the same one.  Not him.  He's only been around for three. 
[00:30:00]  He's got a kickstand in his mouth.  Fucking asshole dog.  Propping his face up with a bone like Jimmy.  That's how he sleeps.  His eyes are half open.  Suspicious asshole.  Not breathing.  Who was there?  Suspicious.  Who's that?  Good.  What?  You know who was panicking about the hurricane?  Who?  Roland was being a little panicky yesterday.  Roland a little panicky.  Because he's moving to Long Island City.  Oh, that's right on the... 
[00:30:30]  Right into the evacuation zone.  It's right on the river.  Right there.  He's knocking on most Sundays.  That's what I'm saying for an extra day.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  He was panicking about the hurricane.  I was coming in this morning and Roland's out in front.  And he goes, I'm walking in.  He goes, I had no show today.  I'm like, why?  I don't know.  I'm just kidding.  He got me again.  He gets you every time.  He's very easy.  He easily gets people.  Yeah, he just knows we're weak.  He gets me a lot of times with like...  Oh, he gets you too?  Yeah, he's like, the boss wants to see you after the show.  And I'm like, but what?  He goes, no, he doesn't. 
[00:31:00]  But then hopefully when Roland really needs it, like when he calls 911.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  Roland's the where's the fire boy.  There's a fire in my thing.  There's a fire in my hair.  There's a fire.  There's a fire.  And then when the real fire comes.  Exactly.  It's all over his big cabs.  His fucking giant meat cabs.  His giant shirt.  His log cabs.  Burned for days.  Jets!  New York Jets!  His Jets New York Jets shirt.  Springsteen picture, actual size.  Where are you? 
[00:31:30]  I'm looking at a map now of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Where are you, Travis?  I'm all the way.  Point the cursor at where you are.  Will they evacuate apartment buildings?  That's the ocean you're pointing at.  Oh my God.  You're on that little strip of beach by Jamaica Bay.  It's a peninsula.  You're in between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.  That is a strip of beach that literally takes three to five minutes to walk across.  Oh yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Tops.  Is it really that small?  Yes.  It's three blocks wide.  I did some work there once.  Oh.  That's why I said it was some guy.  No, that's Rockaway.  Yeah, you're in Rockaway.  Rockaway's that small?  Yeah.  They're predicting that the bay is going to meet the ocean at some point.  Yeah, like that is going to be eliminated and Jamaica Bay will just become a bay of  the Atlantic Ocean.  Oh, I didn't realize that Rockaway Beach is that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know.  Is that fucking...  Is there crime there?  No.  Well, if you go to Far Rockaway, which is further.  Show me where Far Rockaway is further.  If we're looking at it, it really is a very tiny, it looks like a little wishbone. 
[00:32:30]  It's a sliver.  It's almost, if you look at Long Island as the fish, which it is.  Oh, Far Rockaway is more populated.  Yes.  Yeah.  By who?  You know.  Ah.  Undesirable.  Yeah, they put him at Far Rockaway.  And the further towards the west you go, the nicer it gets.  That peninsula is like a gradient in Photoshop.  If you take a solid black, solid white, and then you make a gradient. 
[00:33:00]  It really is.  Because over here, you've got like $4 million homes.  And over here, you have, you know...  Projects.  Yeah.  Is it...  Now, is Far Rockaway more populated?  It looks like it's bigger.  Far Rockaway, yeah.  Far Rockaway is like the forgotten...  The streets are all willy-nilly.  Yeah.  The streets are nice and grid-like on the other parts of it.  And where's a JFK?  Where's an Idlewild Airport?  It's right up there, right?  Yeah, it's where Travis is pointing at the top right.  Don't you get...  Wow.  Do you get air traffic over you anymore? 
[00:33:30]  Or do they stop that when that plane crashed?  Very seldomly.  In the middle of the fucking neighborhood.  Yeah, I mean...  Oh, is that where that was, where that fucking American air was?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, go down...  The map is...  Let me make the map a little smaller, Travis, so I can see the beginning.  Now, this little sliver...  I never knew what Rockaway was.  Rockaway Beach.  Yeah.  I just remember this one funny line from Q&A.  Armando Sante is insulting some guy.  He goes, hey, you couldn't find the Jew in Rockaway.  He was a detective.  He was insulting.  Now, where is the little orange section?  I'm looking at the very tip here.  The very...  The most vulnerable part. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, that's Breezy Point.  That's like government...  That's government property.  Team Breezy.  What happens at Breezy Point?  A lot of wind.  It's very well-to-do over there.  It's government property.  People live there?  Yeah.  So you could live on Breezy Point?  You think they're being evacuated?  Yes.  Wow.  They will be.  Orange is zone one.  Orange is zone one?  You are crazy here because you are really in a bad area.  That whole area is going to be flooding.  Well, yes, I'm in a bad area as far as hurricanes that come every 50 years. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  But you picked a great time to move.  That's true.  I only moved a few months ago.  A few months ago.  What are those fucking little bridges going through the islands?  What is that in Jamaica Bay?  There's all these orange things.  Those are islands.  It's the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge.  Those are like marshy islands.  You can't really stand on them.  But can you go?  There's a wildlife there?  Well, yeah.  There's a reserve.  There are birds.  Can you drive through it?  No.  Sure.  There's a bridge.  You can drive over it.  Oh, over it.  You know, you can't get over it.  It's very marshy.  It's like, you see it when you land at Kennedy. 
[00:35:00]  You look down.  Can you drive over it in April and May or something?  Not marshy.  That was Jim going into the ship because I realized.  So you can drive over that.  What bridge is that?  That's the, I think it's Cross Bay Boulevard Bridge.  And what bridge is this down at the bottom?  That's the Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge.  I've heard of that.  Okay.  I'm so unfamiliar.  I never looked at a map of that area.  That'll take you, like, to the Bell Parkway.  Wait, where's Long Island?  All the way over there.  Oh, okay.  How many times have I looked at that and thought that was Long Island on a map?  Yeah, make it smaller so you can see the whole island. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go down, down, down.  I fucking.  How long does it take you to get to work?  When do you leave?  I leave at 3.30.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I get here at like five.  Yeah, it's like an hour and a half.  What?  God damn, Travis.  I leave at fucking a quarter after five.  It's an hour and a half on the subway.  It would take me 45 minutes to drive that.  And I get here at a quarter to six.  It's crazy.  Travis is a very dedicated worker.  Wow.  Well, that's the price you pay to live half a block from the beach.  Ah.  Okay, you are choosing to live there.  Yeah.  Does Lisa like it?  Loves it. 
[00:36:00]  She's happy with the beach?  Yeah, absolutely.  So you go to the beach a lot in the summer?  All the time.  And what?  Is there anything open 24 hours there?  Yeah.  There's Dunkin' Donuts.  There's Bodegas.  It is New York.  All right.  But you can literally walk across, it's fucking three or four blocks?  Oh, yeah.  It'll take you less than five minutes to walk.  From beach to beach?  From, well, one side, that side is not beach.  What's the point?  The side Travis point is the side that's kind of towards Jamaica Bay.  The Atlantic is not the beach.  Oh, you don't want to swim in Jamaica Bay.  Why?  That's pretty much where the, when planes fly into Kennedy, that's where they're dumping 
[00:36:30]  their fuel.  Oh, with a bird preservative?  Yeah, fucking preservative.  Whatever.  I love bird preservatives.  Oh, yeah.  So, okay.  But that is actually the Atlantic Ocean.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And is anybody going to be on that little island during the hurricane?  Sure, if they don't choose to leave.  Oh, you don't have to leave when you're evacuating?  No.  Even if it's a mandatory evacuation, like, it's...  What are they going to do?  Go from New Orleans?  House to house to house to house to house to house to house to house.  I'm going to keep going until I name every person.  So, what are you doing?  Are you...  You're zone A?  I am zone...  Technically zone B. 
[00:37:00]  Because I'm looking at zone A on the news now.  Zone A is like, that's the fucked up zone.  That's all around Manhattan in a few blocks.  That's my bedroom window.  Oh, wow.  That ocean is going to be right up on that fucking road.  In your bedroom.  You're looking right out at the ocean.  Yeah.  That's fucking...  I didn't know they had ocean-front property in Manhattan or New York.  Well, that's...  Queens.  Queens.  But you know what I'm saying?  New York City.  That's great.  I love it.  Rockaway Beach.  Now, do they have really expensive apartments here?  It's an island, Jim.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  What's an expensive apartment there? 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  I don't own one.  I'm just curious.  But they've built up luxury apartments in certain areas.  With a beachfront property view?  Sure.  Yeah.  It's probably expensive, though.  Yeah, I would think.  Just talking to myself at this point.  I just didn't know this existed.  But it's not as expensive as you'd think because it is far from the city.  Like, I'm paying more...  I'm paying less to live out here than I was in Bay Ridge.  Yeah, it's not convenient.  Yeah.  To get to...  If you work in Manhattan, but if you have an online business, like, let's say you're  whatever.  Sure.  A bunch of kids in the neighborhood, you know. 
[00:38:00]  Never.  So are you overlooking a parking lot?  What is that?  It looks like the back of the store.  Oh, okay.  It's the end of the street.  The street ends.  Street ends and then the ocean begins.  Because it doesn't go on to the beach.  Do you have a balcony?  We don't know.  Now, could you...  Are there balconies?  Yes.  In other apartments.  We live in an older building, but the newer buildings, yeah, they've all got balconies.  Power is so going out.  I'm looking at, like, above the ground power thing.  There's like...  And there's huge transformers.  Three a clip on each telephone pole. 
[00:38:30]  Those you'll hear.  I can't wait till those explode and your dog is just going crazy.  I will be in your house by then.  As PCBs fucking fly all over your fucking window.  I wonder if I'm going to lose power in Manhattan.  You might.  You might.  It all depends.  Some of those places, if they flood, basements flooding and a lot of their electrical systems,  the Con Ed shit that's underground under the streets, water just pours in there, overwhelms  them, shorts them out.  I wonder if far...  Oh, yeah.  I have stuff in my storage room.  I should check that out. 
[00:39:00]  But your area, eh, I think they take care of that pretty good.  Now, if you were in town, let's say...  I don't even think Jim's in a zone.  I'll show you where I am.  It's a secret.  No, I know.  I mean, not the paparazzi.  Look, because that's where all the money is, and it's like, eh, we'll take care of it.  Yeah, but don't worry.  I don't know about that.  I mean, uh...  Yeah.  How's Retard Island?  Hold on.  I'm right to the left there.  It says right there by none of them.  That's fast.  This is going to be there in Retard Island.  Yeah.  Look, you're not even in a zone.  I am, though, man.  It's called the funny zone, Travis. 
[00:39:30]  You're in the zone.  I'm living in the funny zone.  You're in the zone, man.  Where am I?  Well, just show me up there.  I'll show you.  That's 50th, and that's 125th.  Okay, I'm right.  I'm making a big circle.  I like the fucking fingerprint my monitor makes.  I mean, and my monitor.  I have a monitor.  It's called a fucking funny monitor, and it's not working.  It's flat-lined.  There's no zone there?  No.  Well, do you see a color?  Oh!  It's coming in from the ocean the other way.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, I think you're okay.  I think the hurricane would blow in from Jersey, maybe.  You'll be all right. 
[00:40:00]  Like fucking Lou is driving the hurricane.  Nice work, Lou.  I started getting nervous when Jim started talking about taping his windows just now.  Yeah.  Because I have windows, of course.  Go ahead, Mr. Hot Shit.  What else do you got?  A lamp?  Go ahead.  It's all about fucking money bags.  Go ahead.  What does you do to go down a little hole in the bathroom?  Sorry, guys.  One is like a large glass window that you can't open. 
[00:40:30]  It's a big one.  Like a picture window?  Yeah.  A bow window?  And my wrestling figure shelf is right next to the window.  Oh, shit.  Could you imagine now a couple of them tipped over and damp?  That's it.  They damp it.  We're blown away.  Do you know how happy it would be if Sam came home and his fucking windows were all blown out  and those fucking wrestling figures were flooded?  There was something missing?  Floating away down the street.  And you just see him go take that quick turn down the sewer grate as they're going down the street  and then just down the sewer. 
[00:41:00]  And gone forever.  Forever and ever.  That's where my belt is, too.  My championship belt.  In the sewer.  It should be.  No, it's not in the sewer.  Well, hopefully.  The water damage wouldn't be good.  You could dare to dream.  No.  Yeah.  So I am hoping to rescue some people, some animals.  You could have a shelter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  Great.  I don't think I've ever had an animal in that fucking house.  Well, a couple of them.  Yeah, exactly.  Under the guise of women. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  I just think it's great that Ange is inviting us to go to her house at the same time saying,  hey, I think we're coming over to your house.  You two are, obviously.  No, she's three, actually.  Well, yeah.  Leave the kid at home.  No, yeah.  Do you know how funny a scandal would it be if Travis and his wife just decided to go  to Ange and they left the baby and the dog at home and somebody found out the producer  of the Opie and Anthony show left his baby and then you and Lisa were so unapologetic.  You were like, look, the thing is this.  We thought the power might go out. 
[00:42:00]  We wanted to party and go to the pool.  Yeah, yeah.  We didn't want to hassle the kid.  Nobody wants to hear the kid crying.  And then there's Twitter pictures that are on the news of us just drinking downstairs  at the bar.  Yeah.  We'll party and woo.  Oh.  Except the baby in a silhouette crying with its little fist in the air and the fucking  darkness, the shadow of darkness.  What an awful father you are in our imaginations.  But they'd use pictures from the Halloween party.  So Travis would be in his Yo Gabba Gabba outfit.  Yo Gabba Gabba.  Just humiliating.  You'd probably find that picture of you like pushing in my child's head when she was like 
[00:42:30]  six months old when I was trying to find her soft spot with my thumb.  How'd you do?  I found it.  Good.  It's the old one.  Yeah, it's baby.  How old you been?  Two.  Oh, Voss' daughter's four.  Voss' daughter's four years old.  Can't fucking believe she's that old already.  Yeah.  That was a while ago.  Already.  Two years old though.  Yeah.  Two years old.  They start.  No, it's not.  It's young.  I know.  But they start.  It's almost the youngest.  They start yapping at two.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're telling me.  Uncle Paul.  All of a sudden they start pointing and saying stuff. 
[00:43:00]  They start lying.  The first thing they do is lie?  Yeah.  No, no.  Touch there.  No, no.  Muddy touch there.  He touch there.  Hurt there.  Hurt there.  And they start pointing every which away.  Hurt there?  Hurt there.  In that little baby talk, right?  Hurt there.  And what do you say?  Hey, shut up.  I thought maybe you would come up with some kind of excuse.  No.  Like, oh, she fell. 
[00:43:30]  She, I tell her, shut up, you liar.  And what do they say to that?  Hurt there.  Quit pointing at the front of your diapers.  Oh, shit.  Or the back.  Or your mother and father.  I tell them that that baby's a liar.  I was helping her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We was just sitting there.  And I was singing, mares eat oats and doze eat oats and little lambs eat ivy. 
[00:44:00]  Little.  Little lambs.  And all of a sudden she fell.  And hurt herself?  Sure.  Let me get in there.  Put some, put some, put some arrow on the injury.  There was a scandalous story the other day about a young girl.  Yeah.  Uh, she was in a store somewhere with her mom.  Uh, you found that one?  Yeah.  And, uh, and, uh, it, it seems she was wearing flip flops.  Yeah.  And, uh, guys, uh, uh, pedophile perv switch went off. 
[00:44:30]  And the girl is telling the story of how this man walked up and just started kissing her feet.  And all I could think of was the disgusting turkey foot that Uncle Paul would do.  It was the only thing I thought.  You play, I couldn't handle it.  It was them little tootsies.  I just wanted to grab it and go, like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You make turkey noises on the arch.  Sometimes on the ankles.  That's, that's what, uh, seems to have happened. 
[00:45:00]  She, she was, uh, getting her feet kissed until she, she ran away to the parent.  And, uh, I guess her mom turned the guy in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was a towel tail.  She sure did.  I thought you liked your feet turkeyed.  No, I don't.  Everybody likes turkey foot.  I don't think little, uh, little kids like when strangers kiss their feet.  My toes are curling up.  Isn't that what he said?  Yeah, because you liked that when you was a boy.  Sam would have his little Boy Scout uniform on.  And his mother would say, hey, we're going to go get my husband's mustache wax. 
[00:45:30]  Could you watch Sam?  So I'd say, sure.  And I'd put like, I'd put all kinds of cod oil on my, you know what, and make him kiss it.  And I'd kiss his little feet.  Kiss his feet.  He said he could flick a nickel.  That was it, too.  He did take his shoes off on public, not public, on national television.  Nickelodeon, son.  Nickelodeon.  So, uh, a lot of, uh, people saw your bare little boy foot. 
[00:46:00]  He started that because he'd use his feet to try to push my tongue away.  Get it off.  And then he realized he could flick a quarter with it.  Yeah.  That was a library, I guess.  That's the story.  Uh, seven-year-old girl is stating, man sniffed, fondled, kissed my feet at the library.  Yeah.  How do you think you're going to get away with that?  I know.  What the fuck?  She was reading a library when the man allegedly came up. 
[00:46:30]  She said, I didn't know what to do.  I was so petrified.  Poor girl.  The girl said, I want him to suffer.  That's all.  I want him to suffer until he dies.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah, Jesus Christ.  That kid's going to be fucked.  Fucked up for the rest of her life.  So what were you saying, Sam?  I'm sorry.  Yes, Samuel?  Just my toes were curling up.  When you said, when Uncle Paul said turkey foot, like the last time, everybody loves turkey foot.  My toes instantly, completely curled under each other. 
[00:47:00]  It's fucking awful.  Just terrible.  Um, I, I did also want to, uh, hear, the Yankees did very well last night.  My goodness.  Did you, uh, did you see that game at all?  Any of it?  Any of the big, the big yank, yank me game?  Because everybody was saying that the, uh, the, uh, John Sterling calls were fantastic.  Yeah, they had five home runs.  I think it was 162 to one, the score.  Uh, something like that.  Three grand slams. 
[00:47:30]  The only time that's ever been done by a major league ball team.  Wow.  Three grand slams the Yankees had last night.  Yeah, but I bet, I bet the call really became about him and his fucking slug line.  Of course it did.  Instead of, instead of the amazing feet.  Yes.  Let's hear, let's hear how he took their night and made it his.  Are these in order now?  From the first?  Well, there was five home runs.  Yeah.  I pulled, uh, the three grand slams and then an extra home run because it was really good. 
[00:48:00]  Bonus track?  Yeah, bonus track.  Bonus track.  Yeah.  So these are in order.  All right.  Let's get the first home run.  It'll be an 0-1.  Swung on and drilled to deep right.  The ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  It's a grand slam and the Yankees are right back in the game.  Robbie Cano unloads into the right center field seats.  There you go.  Robbie Cano.  Don't you know?  A grand slam and the Yankees trail 7-6. 
[00:48:30]  He fucking just ruined that call.  You could have left it alone.  Rob, what did he say?  The first one was okay.  Robbie Cano unloads into the.  Yeah, fine.  Yeah, that's great.  Action packed.  And then, what do you know?  I'm Robbie Cano.  Robbie Cano.  What do you know?  Oh God, somebody call a paramedic.  That was, okay, so that was the first one.  7-6.  Now, it's got to be like, wow, two grand slams.  He's got to get a little more excited even, I bet. 
[00:49:00]  One would hope.  Now, the right-hander said it'll be a 1-1 to Martin.  Swung on and drilled that deep right.  Back goes to Jesus.  It's way over his head.  And it is gone.  It's a grand slam.  How do you like that?  Two grand slams in the same game by the Yanks.  Great.  Russell shows muscle.  Monsieur Martin.  He hits a grand slam.  The Yankees down 7-1. 
[00:49:30]  Now have a 10-7 lead.  That fucking great two grand slam excitement.  This asshole just wrecks.  And he did a great job up until then.  You don't like the tags on the calls?  It makes me so angry because it's so delusional for him to think that that's entertaining.  Like, the fucking two grand slams back in the Yanks.  That's a great moment.  Great moment.  It's not about you and your fucking slug lines. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But now he's giving each player like two.  Yeah, yeah.  What was that, was that, player?  Russell shows muscle.  Russell Martin.  Russell shows muscle.  And then he did a little French-Canadian thing because Russell Martin's French-Canadian.  Yeah, he did a French-Canadian thing.  I want to know who tells him that that's good.  Whoever tells him that's good, if you're listening and you're not, you're a bigger fucking asshole than he is.  Fucking Steinbrenners.  How about you use some fucking balls, some moxie?  And tell him to...  Cut the shit.  The second you make the call, whenever you think you're going to throw something in that people are going to really like and it's going to be special, stop it right there. 
[00:50:30]  And then you'll have a great call.  And now we've got the third.  This has never been done in Major League Baseball.  Three Grand Slams in one game.  Seven-one down.  What an exciting game.  Yeah, huge.  One-two to Grandison.  And it's got to be Grandison.  Swung on and drilled at deep right center.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Another Grand Slam.  Or in this case, a Grander Slam. 
[00:51:00]  Curtis Grandison.  It's the third Yankee Grand Slam of the day.  The Grandy Man can.  Oh, the Grandy Man can.  Hey, it's a Grand Slam.  And the Yankees have scored 21 runs.  And the Yankees are the first team in Major League history to hit three Grand Slams in the same game.  Do you see, right there, what was more important than saying the Yankees are the first team in history to do it, was you singing that fucking song, you idiot. 
[00:51:30]  You don't like that?  The Grandy Man can.  No, the Grandy Man can.  The fucking Yankees made history, but it had to, there's an OCD shit going, what do you tick every time you say it too?  At least I know I blink, fucko.  Holy shit.  I thought the song was kind of nice, Jimmy.  The Grander Slam. 
[00:52:00]  The Grandy Man.  Oh, by the way, first time in history.  Oh, and a side note to my dumb call.  Yeah.  First time ever.  Wade, I'm fucking shoehorn your dog shit into it when the Yankees are making history.  Oh, boy.  Yes, you're right.  Jimmy really doesn't like this.  But I hope other fans have found this guy to become unlistenable.  Yeah.  And I used to love him, and I still, I always throw in the disclaimer, 
[00:52:30]  because I don't think that he sucks as an announcer.  I really don't.  I like him.  But it's those little dumb tans.  It would be almost like this.  If people who liked me as a stand-up.  Yeah.  If after every joke, I said, so what do you do?  How much would you go, hey, fucking asshole, stop it.  You're wrecking a good thing.  So what do you do?  Yeah, man.  So, you know, Obama, Obamacare.  I'm not having it.  So what do you do? 
[00:53:00]  You'd be like, you know, you should drop the so what do you do.  You're wrecking it.  You're ruining it.  Even though your stand-up is about you, you're wrecking what we're enjoying.  Yeah.  You're missing the part that you're good at, and you're trying to make it catchy.  Yeah.  But you're destroying our night.  And that's what he's doing.  We have one final home run call, I guess.  Bonus track.  This was right after Granderson hit his grandson.  Jesus.  Wow.  Granderson hits a lot of home runs.  I'll say that.  Yes, he would probably be the MVP.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Is he that good?  Yeah.  He's very, very good.  Although, here's a good question.  Travis just said he'll probably be the MVP, and I said, is he that good?  No, I'm just lying.  How many home runs do you have?  At least 20.  I think he's in the 30s now.  That's it?  20 home runs do you have to be MVP in baseball now?  Or the Yankees, you mean?  No.  Pinching my balls.  The Grandy Man.  I think he's got over 30.  The Grandy Man can.  He's very good.  Are the Yankees doing well?  The Yankees are, I believe.  They're in second place.  Second place, but only by a game.  Game behind Boston. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, Boston won again last night.  I love it.  It's always Boston and Yankees.  I'll go back and put it.  But they have an eight-game wildcard lead, so they'll make the playoffs.  Well, let's hope John Sterling feels guilty about something and pulls on Mike Flanagan.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, how about that story, huh?  That's terrible.  Yeah, how about that story there?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's...  It's 35 home runs.  Okay.  Mike Flanagan needs to go and fucking...  Go and fucking...  However, he loft himself while I'm getting some tomato plants on fucking manager's corner. 
[00:54:30]  Earl Weaver.  Earl Weaver.  Shot himself in the face with a shotgun.  Yeah.  Wow.  In the face with a mouth?  Head.  Shot him in the face.  It's hard not to get your...  They couldn't identify him, so...  Really?  They just found a bad mustache on the ceiling?  Fucking winning record?  That's not nice.  It's hard not to heat your whole face when you use a shotgun.  To heat your whole face?  To heat your whole face.  Oh, no, that's a good point, man.  Yes, to heat your whole face.  You're starting to sound like you look.  Yes.  Hey.  So, oh, wow. 
[00:55:00]  He was just depressed because he blamed the Orioles' woes on himself?  Well, how old is Granderson, by the way?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Uh, Granderson is...  Curtis Granderson.  I mean, in days.  Oh, jeez.  Uh, let's see.  I don't know if that would be more on his bio.  Granderson's 30.  Okay.  Um, so, now, why did Mike Flanagan...  Well, he didn't leave a note.  Um, and the police are saying financial reasons, but I think they're just saying that.  Yeah.  He was really depressed that he couldn't get the Orioles back on track when he was, uh, in charge. 
[00:55:30]  He's not there anymore?  No, he was a broadcaster.  Yeah.  So, he's still broadcasting.  Yeah, he was supposed to broadcast this weekend.  I thought it was a microphone.  Yeah.  He was talking into it and was like, oh, fuck.  He really loved that franchise, and I think he took it really personally that, uh, people  kind of blamed him for not being able to get him back on track.  I respect that.  And he apparently always took criticism, like, to heart.  Lighten up.  It's a game.  He was pretty depressed.  Jesus.  I get a little pissed off at the Yankees every so often, but jeez. 
[00:56:00]  Lighten up.  It's a game.  I can't believe you guys shot himself in the face because this guy, making four million,  didn't hit the ball to those people.  Well, you fucking idiot.  That's just speculation.  Yeah, maybe he's got a relationship that fell apart.  What do I know?  Yeah.  Fuck.  He had a wife and three daughters.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's not selfish.  His name should have been Mike Flann for the first time.  Exactly.  Instead of Flann again.  Oh.  Oh, God.  How many times are you going to Flann or something? 
[00:56:30]  Wow.  I have no clue, Chip.  I was Flann by myself.  Put the Flann on.  I'm hot.  I like to eat Flann with all my Spanish friends.  Ah, Flann.  I hate when he gets on a roll.  I am on a roll, too.  What are you standing on?  A piece of bread while I'm on a roll?  I'm sitting.  Sitting on a roll.  You're not going to eat this roll.  That's why I stand on it.  I don't care.  He just keeps going.  Sucks.  Want the bonus track?  I'd love to hear the bonus track.  Pitch.  Swung on it.  Hit in the air to deep left. 
[00:57:00]  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  What a shot by Andrew Jones.  He hit the ball over the auxiliary scoreboard and left, over the grandstand, and way back  in the bleachers.  Whoa, what a home run.  He is Mary Andrew keeping up with the Joneses.  Jones homers and the Yankees have a 22-8 lead.  22-8 lead.  It's hilarious.  That's Andrew Jones from the Braves, right? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, my God.  He's weird.  Keeping up with the Joneses.  How embarrassing.  Do you like that one better than when he hit his first home run earlier this year?  It was Andrew Jones makes his bones.  Makes his bones.  I guess he had a little more time to think about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Why didn't he go back-to-back in a belly-to-belly?  Maybe it wasn't back-to-back.  Well, it was.  I don't know why he didn't do that.  It was right after the Grandison home run.  It's controversial.  Yeah.  Now there's a big...  Maybe he's pulled that from his repertoire.  I hope not.  I loved it.  And Jimmy really loved the back-to-back and a belly-to-belly. 
[00:58:00]  He didn't always do that.  Like, he would...  Years and years ago, man, I've been listening to Yankee broadcasts with him since, I guess,  I want to say...  DiMaggio?  What's that?  Yeah.  Probably since...  Yeah.  Look at her eye.  It is blackened.  Little Marilyn Monroe.  Of course.  Oh, what a giver.  He ruined his liver.  Every time Mantle and Homer.  His head's in the wing-heeled.  Billy Marker. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Fucking...  I don't know.  That certainly wasn't a plain home run.  The Yankee captain, number 15.  Little Munson.  How many am I going to do?  We got to let it go, Jim.  You want to hear it back-to-back?  No.  Just for all time's sake?  I don't remember when it got bad.  Maybe when we come back, someone could tell us, because I would drive down to, like,  Rascals and do open mics in the early 90s, and he would do the Yankees win, but not  always. 
[00:59:00]  He wouldn't always do it.  Right, right.  When he did it, you would feel, like, pumped, because they'd come back, like...  Probably an important game or a big comeback or something.  2001.  The most heartbreaking sports loss ever after 9-11, and the Yankees lost to the...  Yeah, yeah.  ...cunt fucking Randy Johnson.  The big unit.  And that shit Diamondbacks.  I really do hope Randy Johnson is killed for that.  In some sort of a helicopter accident.  He was good?  Yeah, fuck him.  A minute ago, you were criticizing the guy for taking the game so seriously that he committed  suicide. 
[00:59:30]  You just wished murder...  No, not murder.  Oh, it's a helicopter accident.  I hope he's over the Grand Canyon, and he steps his long legs out, thinking he can  reach.  Fucking twat.  Probably could.  Yeah.  But, uh...  Monster.  I'd say it was about the mid-90s.  They were down 2-0.  The Yanks were down 2-0.  They lost them both in Arizona.  And then the next three, they won.  But, I mean, Brocious Holmgren won.  I forget how they won all three games in Arizona.  But, I mean, they were fucking amazing wins.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember being on the parkway, listening to these calls in the car.  Out of my mind!  And those are the big calls. 
[01:00:00]  Those are the ones that deserve the Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  No one...  What was it?  Two outs, nobody on.  That type of shit.  Then a base hit or a double, and then a fucking home run.  Like, amazing ones where you want a little bit of emotion.  Yep.  But then he does it in the middle of fucking April, when it's a 7-1 win over the fucking...  Over the A's.  Spring training games.  In Texas, because they're fixing the A's stadium.  Split team games.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Yankees win, and they lose.  What a douche.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm just giving my opinion, but... 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Well, good for him.  And the Yankees...  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What?  Hope that music...  What?  Oh, Jesus.  Ooh.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Where's the music?  Who wasn't ready?  Ooh.  Who wasn't ready?  Who wasn't ready?  Oh.  Is there music?  What happened?  I didn't know we did that on this show.  What?  We talked about it on the air.  I had said...  I had said...  Oh, my God.  That might have been before the show.  Where is it?  It was before the show.  Where is it?  Music?  Music.  Now we don't get any?  Yeah.  Wait.  Iraq, no? 
[01:01:00]  It's coming.  No?  Almost.  E-Rock?  It's about to...  E-Rock?  Stop fumbling in there.  He's almost got it.  Getting jelly all over the buttons.  E-Rock?  How long does it take?  Isn't this computerized?  It just takes.  What, you're putting on a fucking LP?  Oh!  You can't believe it!  Oh, my God.  There it is.  You're up.  That was just perched.  I was just perched the whole time.  You were waiting.  Ready to come in.  You were waiting.  Yes!  Oh, it's a loose...  Yes!  Loose ship without Opie in here.  Oh, it's crazy.  It's crazy.  You know what would have happened to E-Rock if that would have happened on Opie's watch? 
[01:01:30]  What's that?  Probably thrown out the window with a noose around his neck.  Much more like Omar.  The way they are now.  Yeah.  Opie doesn't have to do anything.  Just E-Rock feels bad inside.  Yeah.  That's how I have my staff.  It's...  Daddy's not happy.  Just feeling...  Just feeling guilt-ridden that they fucked up.  I'm just really here to evacuate the building.  I can't believe there's still someone on 36.  Is that what you're doing?  Do you have the fire watch and hurricane watch today?  Have you guys been watching Bloomberg? 
[01:02:00]  Uh, yeah.  He's...  He's in a fucking panic.  He's in a tizzy.  He's shutting down the subways already on Sunday.  They all shut down.  Nothing...  Nothing's even happened.  What if it's not what they think it is?  He's like Brody right now in Jaws.  He's out of his...  He's out of his mind.  Look, fellas.  Let's be reasonable.  Exactly.  They're not the time or place to close down the subway.  Those subways will stay open.  It's Labor Day weekend.  But it's insane, right?  I know. 
[01:02:30]  He's awful.  He's awful.  He's a fucking woman.  He's a panicky woman.  He's awful.  He is acting like a crazy person over this whole thing.  And I hope it takes a right-hand turn, misses everything, and the news and him and everybody  else just looks like, oh, well.  You know, I lived in Florida for a long time.  No one knows where these things are going.  They're a fucking battling top just swinging around in the ocean.  They really are.  I like how they have their computer models, they say.  And about nine out of ten of them are striking exactly where they say. 
[01:03:00]  But they throw one in.  And if you've noticed, they've thrown one in that goes way off into the Atlantic.  Another one hooks a turn and ends up in Kentucky.  And those are just a cup of their ass.  Like, well, our models did say that.  That it could have done that.  But they want this so bad.  They're all...  Yeah, they're dying for it.  We hope, you know, God willing, we hope this does make a turn and avoid the area.  No, they're drooling at this stuff.  Yeah, the amount of possibilities they actually did have at raining sharks. 
[01:03:30]  Could be sucking up a lot of sharks.  You know something?  Warm water.  The hurricane sucks them up.  Could you see on the street, inland, people getting eaten by sharks?  I would love for the news to have to report that one.  You know, Amityville means friendship.  Friendship.  I want those little hoodlums hung up by their Buster Browns.  I gotta go watch that.  Yeah, it's always...  You gotta give yourself doses of certain movies every so often just to refresh yourself of the lines. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  What are your go-tos?  With Jaws.  One of those.  I like Shawshank.  I'll watch that when I'm going to sleep.  Exactly.  It's boring.  His voice.  What's his facey there?  Tim Robbins.  No, no.  Morgan Freeman.  Morgan Freeman's voice will lull me to sleep.  He plays the same character.  Whether he's playing a convict or the president, it's always,  And then we noticed there was a problem.  It always sounds like he's reading some old-timey Negro book to a young white boy. 
[01:04:30]  He's like a black blanket.  Just comfortable to wrap around yourself.  Goodfellas.  Goodfellas is one of those.  I watch a lot.  What is, like, the newest of all those films?  Oh, that is...  Oh, wow.  What the hell would be the newest one?  You know what?  And I've watched this a lot.  That new goddamn Star Trek that came out in 2009.  Yeah, I like that one.  I saw that in the theater.  I swear I forgot it by the time the lights came on. 
[01:05:00]  I just don't even remember what it was about.  I've always been the sci-fi buff, though, you know?  I'm more into the sci-fi thing.  And J.J. Abrams, you know, with all that lens flare, kind of gave me a little seizure.  Look, felt like it was a cheap buzz.  The guy loves his lens flare.  Yeah, he does.  Oh, my God.  All right, it's a flashlight.  You don't have to put three layers of blues, reds, and yellows on it across the entire screen.  I can't think of any fucking casino I'll never turn off.  I can never turn off casino.  I can't think of something new.  That's a tough one.  What about Magnolia?  That is a tough one. 
[01:05:30]  Anyone?  Magnolia?  Isn't that with Tom Cruise?  Yeah.  Yeah, and Jason Robards, I think, is in that.  Am I wrong?  See, I can't think of anything new.  I watch Alien.  It is Robards.  What about Dark Knight?  Dark Knight's a good one.  I'll watch that.  But that's not like a go-to.  I fast forward to the Joker scenes, though.  I get very embarrassed if the Joker's not on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't like this one.  I don't know it.  And you're evil.  As soon as he's not on, though, it feels like a children's movie.  It just immediately makes you feel like you're watching Puffin stuff. 
[01:06:00]  Because it stinks without him.  Without him, fucking Christian Bale stinks as Batman.  Yeah, yeah.  It's terrible.  Well, what's the next Batman?  That's Dark Knight Rises.  Yeah, and that's Christian Bale.  He beats his mother up in it because she does something he doesn't like in an award show.  Batman clubs his dead mother.  What are you doing?  I made old Star Trek look like new Star Trek.  Oh, see?  It's not just me that noticed.  That's very funny.  It's old Star Trek footage with tons of lens flare in it is what I'm saying. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  That's kind of fucking funny.  The old con.  Why don't we...  Ronnie B's here.  We're going to take a break because we haven't even taken a break yet.  No breaks at all.  I got to eat.  I got to eat.  I could pull a Rich Voss from yesterday, that tool.  He's just eating the whole time.  And Rich eating is fucking disgusting.  It is like watching a whole cafeteria at the retarded school eat.  Food's flying.  You can't understand what he's saying.  It's spittle. 
[01:07:00]  Really disgusting.  And he was telling the story.  It wasn't even like he could sit back.  It was his time to shine.  And there he is spitting all kinds of fucking debris.  It's called being Jewish.  It's an ethnic thing.  It's an ethnic thing.  It's to talk while you eat.  Look at the food I'm eating.  Look.  Look at it.  Look, I'm eating.  I have herring.  I think he has Asperger's.  He's just too dumb to realize.  He has assholes.  It's terrible.  He's just an unpleasant man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that whole thing with like...  You want to...  Like Jimmy...  Weather permitting, which I doubt will happen. 
[01:07:30]  But Jimmy come by the house.  And then, you know, we hang out.  We take a soak in the jacuzzi.  And go in the pool and everything.  And Rich was asked if he wanted to come by.  And he goes, why?  To do what?  Sit in water with you guys?  It's like he looks at it in the simplest of terms.  It's not just guys sitting in water.  You're conversing.  You're, you know, it's relaxing.  And he makes a dumb face that the listeners...  If you knew how hateable he was.  Because you're like, you want to come in the pool? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, you hear him saying it.  But you don't realize how slappable he is.  Why?  I don't understand what you do in there.  It's called communicating and, you know, company, friendship, things.  He won't listen to music in the car.  He listens to talk radio.  Because he's such a fucking dummy.  He wants to one time someone to go, God, that's a good point, Rich.  Like, he's never heard that.  So he listens to talk radio hoping to fucking grab a point that it really is.  He listens to it and doesn't pick up one iota of knowledge from anybody.  All that stupidity you hear is years of talk radio. 
[01:08:30]  Talk radio through his dummy filter.  What an ass.  It really does fucking filter all the smart stuff out and just the rocks.  Yeah, let's take a break.  We'll eat.  We'll come back with a wonderful Ronnie B coming up early.  Checking on the evacuation.  It's crazy how early you guys get up.  Yeah, it's insanity.  You're probably up pretty early yourself, though.  You look like an early riser.  No, no.  Not at all.  Not like the old days.  Last possible second.  I bet old days was probably fucking four in the afternoon for the three o'clock shift. 
[01:09:00]  What are you going to do?  I know.  I hear you.  You just get up and come right in, right?  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  For the last possible fucking second.  I get up at 5.30 and I'm in by like 6.05, sometimes 6.10 maybe.  Yeah.  It's great.  It's wonderful.  It really is.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  I can be better.  I don't know if it's the biggest words.  Now, the manager's corner.  With the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager, the Orioles'  Earl Weaver, today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's six best, your area Oldsmobile  dealers, Anderson Olds, Schaefer and Strominger Olds, Lee Oldsmobile, Metro Olds, City Olds, 
[01:09:30]  and Stuberger Olds.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer.  From Frederick Merriman, wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some  more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on the fucking bases, getting picked off, trying to  steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball out of the ballpark and you 
[01:10:00]  can't make any goddamn mistakes.  Well, certainly this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C., wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a  designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings and enjoy watching  a baseball game, just like any other fan, and has the ability to get up there and break 
[01:10:30]  one open in the fucking ninth.  So if this cocksucker had to mind his own business and let me manage the fucking team,  we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball,  Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lady's coming from, rather  than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out of the fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn 
[01:11:00]  street, she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go fuck yourself and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball  fucking Network.  So, what do you do?  The Opie and Anthony Show on SiriusXM.  The virus.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  Marriage is... 
[01:11:30]  No one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff.  It's like, it's a business, it's a machine.  One person's doing the twittering, which is rich, and the other person is spelling all  the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie.  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it.  Is he an affectionate guy?  He, no.  Is he bad with like casual loving touching?  Well, because I don't know if he touches you, but it's like a toddler or a monster that 
[01:12:00]  doesn't, like hasn't figured out how to caress.  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter her fragile  ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face.  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie, and rest a little  easier knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted. 
[01:12:30]  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  That's going to be not a whole thing.  This is the virus, Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow, any reason we're going way back to the 90s?  It's got to be.  Jerky Boys movie?  Right?  No reason.  I just found it, so I figured I'd play it.  Oh, well, E-Rock, just make decisions for yourself back there. 
[01:13:00]  Lucy Goosey Nagel today.  Lucy Goosey Nagel.  Yeah.  I'm going to expect attention from what we've got here.  Well, we do have Ron Bennington from the Ron and Fez show, which can be heard from 11  a.m., right after the shit show.  After show.  Well, the shit show after, whatever it's called.  Right after the shit show, where Ron and Fez come on.  And now that's a show.  That's a program that I listen to.  Uh, Sam had a big guess yesterday, was the only Playmate I've ever seen without an ass. 
[01:13:30]  I had never seen that before in my life.  Did you notice at all, Sam?  No, I didn't see it.  She was sitting down when I saw her.  Did you have the same girl on that we had?  No, it was a Playboy Playmate that was like, you know, the girl we had on was from Penthouse,  and she came in, and the first thing she did was took her tits out, and she pulled her skirt off.  And this girl was in like an old t-shirt and a pair of jeans, and Ron Bennington informed  me that she had no ass either.  Oh, really?  For a Playmate, it's very surprising. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  I don't know how she was from.  She was proning cigars, though.  But she wasn't into, like, she wasn't wearing anything sexy.  No, nothing sexy at all.  They don't get it, do they?  It's like, who wants, A, nobody wants to listen to you.  Do you think that you're just going to make people smoke cigars because you were fuckable  in a magazine?  No.  Probably right.  She came in doing a read, too, didn't she?  Yeah.  Macanoodle, who was here.  Yeah, she had this whole paper.  Well, I don't hear the paper out.  Rob Cross told me that, because Rob Cross booked her on the after show out of nowhere, 
[01:14:30]  and I go, okay, bring her on.  Wait, he books for you?  He just saw her in the hallway, because apparently she was with some guy.  I don't know if she was booked on any show, but this guy was just passing out flyers  to people who are on the air or know people on the air trying to get into studios.  Do people just come up here in the elevator, walk around until someone goes, yeah, let's  get them on the air?  The weird thing is you can't get a friend in here, no matter what.  No, they have to go through 18 levels of security, but you just see people milling about in the  halls and go, yeah, come on in, we'll talk to you. 
[01:15:00]  Those fucking, what are those horse ranch girls, what the fuck they are?  The prostitutes that come in all the time.  Oh, yeah.  And then they just put their fucking faces up against every show.  Yeah.  Yeah, they love getting air time.  Oh, do they love it.  And they got nothing to say.  No.  Nothing.  Like, tell us something.  Tell us about, you know, taking in the ass.  How much is it?  Does it hurt you at this point in your life?  You hate it.  You ever accidentally shit on somebody during anal sex?  Come on, let's get to it. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, something interesting.  Ronnie B, I was asking earlier, how is Fez?  Oh, unbelievable.  Just really strong right now.  Really doing great.  There is he.  Great.  Because I just see him.  We cross paths in the turnstiles.  I'm going out.  He's coming in.  It's like, all right, how you doing?  It's like the sheepdog and the coyote that would punch in and out in the cartoons.  The old time card.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He, because we were on the air the other day when the earthquake hit. 
[01:16:00]  Ah, right.  So we got the feeling in the building, you know, the kind of bounce in the building.  Since then, not so good.  Not so good.  Yeah.  See, see, if everything goes perfectly, he seems to be teetering on the head.  So if you get, especially something like an earthquake, that's got to shake him up a little.  Well, yesterday, the thing was, he kind of got locked up and we're going, what's the problem?  And he goes, well, what if the earthquake loosened the foundation on the building and now the hurricane winds knocked the building over? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, pushed the building over.  And it's the kind of stuff that, you know, I think like when you're four, you kind of, you know, the kind of stuff that little kids will say to you.  It'll scare the kid.  He couldn't mean that.  He claimed that he did.  He claimed that he thought that through some kind of perfect storm.  Yeah, the weakening from the earthquake and then the high winds.  I mean, the buildings work as a sail. 
[01:17:00]  They're giant and a lot of pressure pushes against these things.  I might have to be in his corner on this one.  Don't even say that jokingly because I know he's listening.  I might have to actually think about it.  What does hold these things up?  Well, these are technically not, I'll say this kidding aside, these are not built up to the standards that they are on the West Coast.  Like these buildings were not built with earthquakes in mind.  So foundations here, Dr. Carter said that.  They never thought there would be an earthquake of any substance where you would need earthquake proofing. 
[01:17:30]  These are just solid buildings with foundations that go deep in the ground that can probably get affected very easily.  And they've had inspectors in here for the last few days checking because there have been a few foundation cracks in the city.  But I'm sure it's fine.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.  No problem.  The hurricane can only push, what, 100 mile an hour winds pushing against the surface that's probably a couple of square acres of vertical.  Nothing's going to happen, Ronnie. 
[01:18:00]  But it's a thousand miles away right now.  So we're fairly safe.  We're all right.  Yeah.  We're fairly safe.  Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.  On Sunday.  It's going to hit on a day when you're not even here.  If he shows up and the building's not here, he could then feel relieved.  It's like, hey, I wasn't in that.  I think we'd hear about it, though.  Yeah, but there's also a couple of days before a hurricane hit, there's updraft winds, which always come.  Why?  Why do this?  Seriously.  Why do things?  There are.  Hurricanes have updraft winds that will go.  They don't talk about them much because they're hurricane force, but they're quick. 
[01:18:30]  It's like wind shear almost.  Yeah, almost like a quick updraft winds.  See, this is a form of bullying.  It really is.  It is.  It is bullying.  You're right.  You're right.  But is he...  So the hurricane thing has him a little...  Yesterday was a very, very bad day.  He was even doing a late night after-hours therapy session.  Oh, to kind of get put in a better place.  Yeah, he goes to a carny a couple of times a week.  But he hasn't been able to help him. 
[01:19:00]  With his anxiety, but he could guess his weight, I think.  Oh, is that it?  Within like a pound.  Age your weight.  Age your weight.  Step up.  Hurry, hurry, hurry for your session.  You win the medication from this shelf or this shelf.  So it's a little stressful.  Yeah, it really is not getting any better.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  Really, only six years or so that it's been a six-year panic attack. 
[01:19:30]  And the medications don't work?  He doesn't...  He can't handle the medications.  No?  Maybe a Xanax or something?  No.  He said that that makes him anxious.  Xanax makes him anxious.  I think I know you can.  He's the only person on the face of the earth that that happens to, I would gather.  People take him recreationally.  Maybe he's taking him with coffee.  Wash it down with some espresso.  Coffee makes him drunk.  It's just the opposite. 
[01:20:00]  You said you had a clip of that earthquake, Fez?  Yeah?  It's probably the comic earthquake.  No, I hope not.  Let me hear a little of that, Mr. Erock.  The person who really did Fez's mixtape, Kathleen from the Bronx, will tell you.  That's right.  Hey, Anthony, why don't you fucking talk to Kathleen?  You feel this building moving?  Yeah.  What's that about?  I don't, the floor's going up and down. 
[01:20:30]  Okay.  That's the main part where they'll be like, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So, hotel.  Hotel.  But did you feel it where you were at all?  Did you feel the earthquake?  I was sleeping.  Yeah.  I just slept through the, my chick came in, and she was outside by the pool, and she's  laying out by the pool, and she came in and woke me up, and she goes, did you feel  that?  I was like, no, I was, I was just sleeping. 
[01:21:00]  Feel what?  She goes, it was just an earthquake.  She goes, the tiki torches started moving, and then she goes, the chandelier started going  back and forth.  I look at the chandelier over the dining room table, and it's moving, and I go, you pushed  that fucking thing.  And she goes, no, I swear I didn't.  And then I look at the big one that's in the foyer.  I'm just bragging, by the way.  Foyer, chandelier, tiki torches.  It's in the foyer, chandelier, tiki torches.  It was Mo Green's place.  And hopefully, Matthew will get a massage. 
[01:21:30]  My glasses on.  Yeah.  And that was shaking.  Then I realized, all right, that would have to be a pretty good gag if she was shaking  and that fucking thing, because that's out of reach.  So I then believed her.  Well, the weird thing is, like, we just bounced up and down.  We didn't go side to side.  Yeah, that's what I heard about.  This building was an up and down bouncing motion.  That's what the EROC told me.  Well, these floors are also raised, aren't they?  Because they're not, aren't they raised floors?  Does that matter?  As far as they are raised.  Maybe it does.  Yeah, that's why you feel like I was expecting interns to come running by on the way somewhere. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, they said the building went up and down and not side to side, because you feel it kind  of go side to side in high winds, which I'm thinking in the hurricane, you're probably  going to, if you're up here, you'd feel it going side to side, which would really, thank  God this is happening on a weekend, because you'd have your hands full there, Ronnie.  Well, the problem is he does live in a high rise himself.  Oh, he's still on Retard Island?  Yeah, he is.  That island is, it's an island. 
[01:22:30]  That island is a flood zone.  Yeah.  That island is like being on a cruise ship.  Yeah.  And does he have any worries about his...  No, no, none at all.  Everything's just laid back and easy.  Hunky-dory.  Take it as it comes, Spaz Watley.  He's taking it as it comes, Spaz.  What is he thinking of doing to...  Well, to take his mind on it, he's got a book about cancer and what it does to the body,  and he's just going to sit in his house and read that. 
[01:23:00]  I think it's called brain cancer.  He's got to get out.  I keep talking about this.  What do you want?  Are you building the show?  No, no.  He's got to get out.  You fired him?  You fired him?  No, I'm not firing Fez.  But I don't understand why you say he's got to get out.  Like, he's not ruining anything.  No, I know.  No, out.  And I'm out on the town.  Not on the town.  He wants him to live a good life.  He doesn't want him to get out of here. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, have a little fun.  It's weird, though.  He's got to get out.  And you're looking around the radio station.  All of a sudden, he's spoiling things.  No, no, no.  I never said that and would never say that.  Whatever.  Okay.  I don't hear the same things you do.  I don't have ears.  I hear I said it.  Fair enough.  I don't get it.  All right, no, cool.  Because when I've seen Fez at his happiest years ago, it was when we were all out and  partying and having some fun and, you know, those little get-togethers we used to have. 
[01:24:00]  This might be all he has.  Radio might be all he has.  He's got to get out.  He's got to get out.  He's got to leave.  He doesn't have, you're right about that, Jimmy.  He doesn't have, like, a personal life right now and he needs one.  Yeah, yeah.  And what he does, his whole thing, is this station and you're like, fucking, what is  he, down, make it a downer for you and all of a sudden he's got to go?  I don't remember saying that.  I heard what Jim heard.  I was saying he's got to get out of his house.  Why can't we all stay?  We can all stay.  Yeah.  I'd like to get out.  Why can't he? 
[01:24:30]  Because he does need to just be out in social settings.  Instead of working in radio?  It doesn't seem right.  No, no, no.  Why wouldn't you want him here?  He's been with you.  I'm saying do the show.  Do the show.  And then-  On a different channel?  No, no.  Exactly as it is now.  Everyone heard you, dude.  He needs to get out.  And just, like, socialize.  No, no, no.  Still with the show.  Everyone was nervous about the earthquake.  Ron and Fez show.  People like Fez here.  11 o'clock.  Fez is there.  Doing the show, just like always. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  And then afterwards, you go out.  You meet some people.  You socialize.  And you forget about your troubles.  You don't want him in the studio?  And never come back.  Yeah.  I'm trying to get him to move to Chelsea.  Yeah?  Maybe a West Village.  Yeah, somewhere around there.  Don't get out there.  Yeah.  Has there been any-  None.  None.  You just answered immediately.  Yeah.  None.  Any headway on that secret thing? 
[01:25:30]  Because I haven't, over the years, I've noticed that secret.  What secret thing?  What secret?  Is there a new co-host being sought?  No.  Why are you asking about that, Ant?  I didn't say that.  It's weird.  It's weird.  Like, Fez has a secret, but I don't know what it is.  And I thought maybe I'd missed what it was.  Right.  And I just was trying to clear that up to see if maybe that's come out.  And, no, it's a desire that still has not been acted upon.  Uh-huh.  Even though he told me the secret, it's coming up on three years ago. 
[01:26:00]  It is three years ago.  And that was a gigantic relief to him.  And I'm like, good, buddy.  Let's do it.  Let's get out there.  He was relieved telling you.  Yeah.  Now, wouldn't that-  Wouldn't you think he'd be more relieved than telling everybody?  Getting that all off his chest?  Or even doing the secret.  He hasn't.  Oh, it's a, it's something that can be done.  It's an activity.  Right.  He hasn't done any of the activity.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's no secret now. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  I will tell you this, though.  How about that?  In that three years, I've sucked 18 dicks.  But that's the odd thing about it.  Weird.  You still have a show.  You have to.  Yeah.  Around this fucking place.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Scott.  Oh, another meeting.  Oh, I get it.  Black reed.  Right.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, are you all hooked up for this hurricane? 
[01:27:00]  Where are you?  Where are you?  Are you a low-lying area?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm fine.  Yeah?  I'm living, I live in a mountain.  Oh, you're fine then.  Yeah, the mountains are-  You know, it's New York.  You're not going to get in any trouble here.  Nothing, right?  Yeah.  What the fuck are they talking about?  Manhattan.  They're watching too many of these Discovery Channel computer animations of what could happen  to New York City that ain't ever going to happen.  I saw some of those where they were showing, like, Long Island City being swamped.  Just completely underwater, like Planet of the Apes. 
[01:27:30]  The fucking, the Statue of Liberty is down there.  Heston's, Heston's pounding the beach.  There's fucking people from 125th Street chasing them.  Jimmy's actually doing a Statue of Liberty right here now.  I'm eating my yogurt, so I'm trying not to eat as many carbs, and I'm holding the mic  up in the air.  But I hold it, so if I want to say something, I can drag it back down.  Ah, good.  But I'm like, fucking, oh, a fucking hawk mouth yesterday.  I don't want to chew into the mic.  You mean people can hear this?  We don't.  Unfortunately.  We really don't care, though.  I know.  That wouldn't be rude. 
[01:28:00]  When it's us.  When it's a guest, we can then jump on him.  That was great yesterday, having Voss and Bob Kelly in here, and just, just slamming.  The idea that Bob Kelly went down to, to friggin' West Virginia, or wherever it was, to pay  people $50 for a bucket of dirt to find gems in.  You know that old gag?  Oh, God, yeah, like your dad would pull over when you were doing road trips.  Right, right, right, yeah.  Yeah, oh, we're going to get some dinosaur fossils, and they would give you this, you'd 
[01:28:30]  be at this big dirt thing with a screen with some wood around it, and shake it, and be like,  hey, there it is.  Look, you got yourself a dinosaur bone.  Bobby did this, like, for real.  At age 40.  Yeah, yeah.  And what was even better about it was he came here to say, no, I'm not a sucker.  I'm telling you guys, I found out it's a scam.  Yeah, I found out it's a scam.  It's just news.  It's a scam.  So he went initially not thinking it was a scam.  They gave him, he goes, you could go out with your own shovel and your own bucket and pick 
[01:29:00]  up your own dirt and find some gems, or you could just buy a bucket of dirt that they already  picked up and put in.  So we just bought the bucket.  There's a $50 bucket, a $200.  It's like buying buckets of dirt.  But I'm like, you don't think that they would sift through that?  Like, how could any adults not think that they would look through it before giving it to you?  No, there were rubies in there, emeralds.  Emeralds?  It's like he's fucking in sub-Saharan Africa digging.  There's nothing there.  If anything happens to Americans, it's the fucking Americans' fault. 
[01:29:30]  I mean, we've been around long enough to see every angle, and then we just drop it and fall back into it.  Right into it.  There should be no infomercial that fucking fools an American, and yet people are fucking  dialing away at 3 o'clock in the morning.  People are getting rich off of these fucking products that, yeah, yeah.  They should.  The infomercials.  Churches.  Make people dial, and they make everything look difficult.  Normal thing.  Putting a sheet on a bed can be a problem. 
[01:30:00]  And the woman's hair is a mess.  And they make the bed.  And then it ends with the woman just going like, blowing her bangs up.  She's all disheveled.  But now, and now they've figured out a way to make you buy two of everything.  You're not getting a free one.  Stop it.  Buy now.  Order now.  But wait.  Order now and get a second one absolutely free.  Just pay separate chipping and handling.  So now you're getting the second one.  They're making you buy.  They force you to buy two things. 
[01:30:30]  It's astounding.  And no one ever says to you, I've had this thing for 18 years, and it's just been really great.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  I'm still using it.  When they pitch it, it just sounds so good.  Everything just sounds so good.  It's going to work.  They say it works.  Is there anything that you've ever seen on an infomercial that looked good?  That you would actually order and be like, that I can use.  Right.  No.  And it's never a necessity.  There's nothing.  There's never like food, water. 
[01:31:00]  It's just stuff you fucking don't need.  I like that little claw that you can grab things off the top shelf with.  Because that's got to be great for handling heavy glass products.  Fucking sauce.  That's what the carnies use to take the stuffed animals down to give to the kids.  And they just translate it into what they sell people now.  But a lot of that shit is just aimed towards the elderly.  Yeah.  Like everything hurts.  So now you'll have this claw, so you won't have to call your nephew to come over anymore.  Yeah.  Annoy him.  Or fat people now, how you can wash your back and put your shoe on. 
[01:31:30]  The shoehorn one.  Did you see that?  Oh, the shoehorn on a stick.  It's a shoehorn on a stick.  Yeah.  That's like something Kramer would come up with.  A shoehorn on a stick so you don't have to bend over.  God forbid you get yourself back into any kind of shape where you can put your own fucking shoes on.  You're better off handing that guy a handgun.  Yeah.  What they don't really say is to wipe your ass with.  If you can't reach your ass anymore, perfect.  Toilet paper on a stick.  There was that one for people that couldn't reach for toilet paper to wipe their ass with. 
[01:32:00]  But they didn't even put it if you're too fat.  Injured.  Injured.  Your back hurts.  And it was people wiping their ass with this fucking claw that held the toilet paper.  And you reach under or something.  Filthy.  How filthy is that thing?  I'd hate to be sure potato salad with somebody's claw that did double duty.  Those are the Beverly Hillbillies I think use.  It's a fucking pass food around.  Well, look at what we've got here, Jethro.  The fancy eating table. 
[01:32:30]  Pass me some hog jowls, kid.  Let me get the comfort wipe.  That's what it was called.  Look at this.  Comfort wipe.  Yeah.  Turn the volume up.  I gotta hear this one.  You put the paper in the fucking thing.  This is disgusting.  Oh, God.  We've been scrunching and folding toilet paper.  See, they make it.  Finally, there's a better way.  How bad life works.  Comfort wipe.  The sanitary paper.  Sanitary.  Arm and holder.  The first improvement to toilet paper as we know it since the 1880s.  It has happened in the 1880s.  18 inches.  While it follows the comfort of your body and comfort and clean it. 
[01:33:00]  Fucking Custer wiped with his own scalp.  It's as easy to use as a shower brush.  You know how to wipe their ass.  Just pop on the toilet tissue and go through.  Just press the release button and the tissue drops right into the toilet.  How?  Toilet paper is really archaic and disgusting.  The comfort wipe is the most solution.  Yeah, that isn't.  To put it on at the end of a stick.  Never touch another.  Here's you an extra two feet of reach.  Here's begging.  This is a great product.  It's embarrassing to have someone help you with your personal matters. 
[01:33:30]  Your personal matters.  Maintain your dignity.  Selling patty.  Selling patty.  Your dignity.  The sanitary paper extension arm and holder.  By the way, do you know how horribly that must wipe your ass?  It's literally just being gripped.  It's like it probably smears shit all over your butt cheeks.  And you know, the paper's got to slip out.  Yeah, I would hope so.  So now you've got that thing.  You've got shit on it.  Someone who just doesn't want to touch dirty toilet paper.  Don't be embarrassed.  Just get a comfort wipe.  Order now.  And what do you leave it by the side of the bowl? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  So the young kids that are visiting the house can look and go, oh.  They chase each other with it.  You can't flush in a trailer anyway.  Getting in and out of the tub has never been more comfortable.  Oh, yeah.  They're including the grip.  That doesn't have a lawsuit written all over her.  It's the same thing so you can shit in the tub.  You have to call now.  I love the way she said you help with your personal matters.  Personal matters.  Personal matters.  What do they say?  Serve your dignity.  That's right. 
[01:34:30]  Patty.  I used to date a girl whose mom used to buy that stuff every now and then.  And as soon as she got it, she would try to show us how great it was.  But it would never work.  Or she could never hook it up.  Right?  Like the book light that wouldn't clamp onto a book.  And she couldn't keep her page or anything.  No, it's great, though.  It's all right.  Well, when the UPS guy drops it off, he turns around and runs before you get it.  Yeah, they know that piece of shit is coming back.  Hand, hander pants.  The underpants for your hands.  What? 
[01:35:00]  This can't be real.  I hate the parody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  There's a lot of parodies out there.  I hate the parody.  Yeah, that was...  I can't imagine that that toilet paper would stay there.  So now there's shit on the stick.  Yeah.  And you've got to put it somewhere.  Dude, when I wipe my ass, I fucking wrap the toilet paper around my finger.  Do you?  Yes.  There's an art to fucking...  You can't just take it...  That's the equivalent of taking a rubber band and taking one sheet and banding it to your  hand and flat wiping your asshole. 
[01:35:30]  That's even worse because it pinches the paper.  In the middle, right?  Right.  So it doesn't go in the crack.  It goes around a little.  You're wiping around your ass, not the dirty part.  You're not getting the bullseye.  It's got to go outwards, not in.  That should be...  You're hitting a double bull every time.  The double bull.  You got to...  If you go to someone's house, you go to a girl's house, you should always look in the  bathroom for a comfort wipe before you commit to eating her ass.  If you see one of those, avoid it at all costs.  Can we hear her talk again?  Dignity.  Oh, your personal matters. 
[01:36:00]  It's a great product.  It's embarrassing to have someone help you with your personal matters.  The comfort wipe allows you to maintain your dignity.  Her shoulder comes out.  You can maintain your personal hygiene.  She reminds me of Helen Bergeron.  Oh, yeah.  And why does she need people to help her?  Exactly.  You look perfectly healthy.  Yeah.  Well, maybe we didn't see.  She's got no arms.  Yeah, exactly.  You should just use a little Filipino kid to be in there helping you out.  When he's not wiping your ass, he's setting off fireworks in your living room as he snorting 
[01:36:30]  lines.  Mode of rain.  That's a movie I could watch.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one, man.  Fuck, is Boogie Nights great, man.  Boogie Nights is a good one.  God, it's a good movie.  You're not being fair.  Crash, I can watch over and over.  Oh, yeah, you're not the Crash.  I can watch that any time I can watch.  Crash, the movie?  Yeah, that wasn't a fan of that one.  I don't like it.  Oh, you're all wrong.  No.  Oh, jeez.  Fuck us running.  Wow, I'm surprised.  Terrence Howard's one of the best black characters ever.  No, I really hate him.  Why does he have to be a black character? 
[01:37:00]  You're racist.  Why did you hate him?  I don't see people.  I don't either.  There's something very surface to me about it.  Really?  Yeah, I thought it was shallow.  I thought it was a good statement about it showed you the kind of the duality of every  person.  I thought it was too obvious.  Yeah, it jumped on like really stereotypes.  Oh, the bad cop.  Now, look.  See, it's not always the bad cop.  I think that was kind of the point of it, though, because Hollywood always vilifies the  fucking white cop, and they always, they never attack the way they fucking, they whiten 
[01:37:30]  up black people.  They never go after that.  You never see a guy like Tony Danza going, hey, could you make him seem a little smarter  or a little dumber or whatever?  You never hear that shit.  And Terrence Howard, they show how that fucking affects.  I thought it was great.  I'm going to have to watch it again.  I don't know.  I love it.  And they also, they also don't vilify the cops because then this guy's, well, he's fucking,  he's pulling his chick.  To me, that was a representative of the fucking white cops in the black community.  Like, yeah, the guy's a piece of shit sometimes, but he's crawling into a burning car to pull 
[01:38:00]  you out.  Like, there really is, it's not just easy to vilify these cops as these fucking awful.  How many of these cops are fingering the fucking chick, though, while she's against the wall?  But again, it was symbolic.  To me, it was all symbolic.  In the 50s.  In the 50s, they would do that.  In the 50s, they would do that.  But it doesn't happen anymore.  It was symbolic.  Hey, well, how many times would you finger a chick and pull her out of a burning car?  I don't know, two out of three, maybe?  But it's not going to happen every time.  Yeah, I don't know.  Terrence Howard?  Oh.  Yeah, I thought everybody would.  You embarrass me, you embarrass yourself.  One of the best lines ever. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, yeah, come on, fucking ludicrous.  We look, they're walking around looking like college students.  They're like, why are they afraid of us?  You're like, oh, another fucking message from a movie.  And then they pull out the gun and they rob Sandra Bullock.  She was right to be scared of the blacks.  I like that one.  I like that accurate part.  But you know what I'm saying?  They fucking.  Like, I didn't think it got complex at all.  Like, I thought everybody was just sort of very cut and dry.  Like, okay, now we're doing this bad part.  Now we're good part.  Now we're bad part.  Now we're good part.  And everybody was just kind of following exact stereotypes.  Like, there wasn't any sort of stimulation. 
[01:39:00]  I kind of like that.  Stimulation.  Because there were so many people to show.  Like, they didn't.  Like, the little girl didn't get shot.  Like, you think she's going to.  Like, here's another cliche.  They don't do it.  Or the fucking fat black woman who will not help Matt Dillon.  All of a sudden, you're like.  Even though you can't say, I know why he hates blacks.  You can go, that is fucking enraging.  He's not crazy to be angry all the time.  And then you see what a cunt she is racially when that fucking Asian woman hits her at the end.  She's out screaming.  This Asian bitch.  So she's doing the same shit that he did to her. 
[01:39:30]  It's like they don't just vilify.  This movie sounds confusing now.  They don't just vilify the same people.  It's almost like you're talking about The Godfather, the way you move by this.  I've never met.  I've never ran into anyone who has watched Crash so many times.  But that's why it won Best Screenplay that year.  It fucking upset every movie.  Nobody thought that was going to win.  Well, it was also like that L.A.  Let's all feel good about L.A.  You know, we know.  We're Hollywood.  I don't know.  There was something about it that just fucking annoyed me.  I thought it was anti-L.A.  Anti what they normally do. 
[01:40:00]  It was anti the rest of L.A.  You know what I mean?  They were like, yeah, we know we live in a shithole because we're sensitive artists.  Yeah.  Which kind of made it L.A.  Yeah, right.  I don't know.  I thought Cheadle was fucking great.  Cheadle's a good actor, yeah.  I didn't see the thing about that being his brother coming.  That relationship with his mother I thought was great.  Wow, you remember.  I really do.  I love it.  I love it.  The first time I saw it, I loved it because I kept waiting for them to do what I knew they  were going to do. 
[01:40:30]  And every time they didn't.  It's always the same.  You know, Nick DiPaolo cries about it, and justifiably, how white men are always made to  look a certain way.  All they do, and everyone, oh, look, it's the black female judge.  Oh, because he's fucking pandering.  I like the fat, sassy black female judge in a movie.  Oh, it's so fun.  That's Hollywood's idea of a fucking redeeming black character.  They do the same thing.  You never see a guy like Terrence Howard snapping after being white this whole movie and beaten  down by Hollywood and saying shit like that to fucking, and then the good white cop, 
[01:41:00]  who's the hero in every movie, turns out to act like a racist like every other fucking  panicky white person, and he kills the guy who he shouldn't have killed.  That white cop is the hero in every movie.  He's the fucking, he's the fucking, he's the hero in every movie.  He's the guy who understands the minorities.  He doesn't react.  It's just the pig, Matt Dillon.  Maybe I was watching Porky's.  But in the end, fucking Matt Dillon, the horrible guy, fucking pulls a chick out of a car, and  he fucking panics and shoots a guy and dumps one on the side of the road. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, and it obviously would never happen that way.  But to me, it really, it fucking, it flipped roles a lot.  Which I liked.  You moved.  I was.  I loved it.  I loved it.  You're going to see Big Lebowski.  That's really good.  I did recently, recently, just the other day.  It's the first time I've ever seen it.  Now, I've heard about the Big Lebowski for many years.  And I.  You never saw that?  Never.  Never.  Until just last week. 
[01:42:00]  I watched it.  And then, like right when it ended, I'm sitting there going like, what was all the hype about  this movie?  What the fuck was all the hype?  But then I realized, like, I started thinking about some of the lines and laughing and thinking  that was kind of funny.  It's one of those movies you've got to watch a few times.  The Coen Brothers, it's never a first time watch.  Right.  It's always watching it over and over.  Yeah, like Fargo, I could watch now.  Right.  And still laugh my ass off.  But the first time I watched it, I was pretty much like, all right, this is kind of a crime.  Right. 
[01:42:30]  Kidnapping thing going on.  But then you realize how fucking funny it is.  It's almost like a parody of those kind of movies.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Somebody explain something to Big Lebowski to me.  They were talking about, like, when you write a character or whatever you do, and they  were saying, like, in the opening scene, and I've only seen it once years ago, he walks  into a store and writes a check for milk or something.  Yeah.  And they're like, in that moment, you know who this guy is.  I'm like, that's a smart.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  Sometimes the little character things tell you in a second exactly what the fucking guy is.  It's the way he was dressed.  And he's always dragging a white Russian. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, yeah, the fucking thing.  He was in not too long ago.  I know, yeah.  I'm giving away that, in the football contest, if you go to 202 Friends, we've got to sign  Big Lebowski, which to these fucking people is going to mean the world to them.  That's gold.  But you've got to be able to do some football picks.  Yeah.  You guys are a football gambler, is it?  I know.  No, no.  Gambler on a few things, but not football.  I already have a sign, Big Lebowski, anyway.  Do you?  I have to choose here.  What?  Did you really?  Yes, but I wasn't here. 
[01:43:30]  I couldn't meet him.  I was too tired.  I had to take TV.  But I was fucking, I love him.  That movie just, and that movie absolutely made me want a white Russian.  That's what, that was the biggest impact on it.  And weed.  And weed.  I went right down to the bar and made a white Russian.  Yeah.  And it was like, god damn, these things are good.  They're so tasty.  And it was funny how it would just stick in his beard.  Stick in his beard.  And mustache the whole time.  So it is one of those, I guess I've got to watch it a few more hundred times.  But the Coen brothers, all their fucking films are like that. 
[01:44:00]  They are so good.  I'll watch Raising Arizona over and over and over.  I don't know if I've seen that more than once years ago.  It's Nicolas Cage, right?  Yeah, yeah.  There's not a single set up line in that movie.  Every movie is, every line in the movie is the punch line.  Yeah.  It's so fucking funny.  Brother Where Art Thou is another one.  It actually showed you how crazy white people were going to be.  It was like a futuristic look of the way life is now in 2011, where white people have  become the craziest people we have.  Wasn't he like a male escort in that or something? 
[01:44:30]  Or a prostitute?  No.  Which one am I thinking of with...  No, that was Leaving Las Vegas?  No, no, no, no.  Gigolo, American Gigolo?  No, no, no.  Who doesn't love Call Me as an opening song?  Call Me!  Well, who's the old twat he was banging in that?  That was like a Lauren Bacall or something?  Go back and watch that thing.  It's so funny and dated because it's like he is picking out ties while Call Me plays for  three minutes.  The opening three minutes, he's just pulling out his clothes and looking at it.  They bought the rights to the song. 
[01:45:00]  They wanted to get every fucking drop out of it.  But anything like from the 70s moves so much slower than people can possibly pay attention  to.  Planet of the Apes was on, and there's like a 20-minute scene where they're driving through  the desert.  You know, they're just walking through the desert.  Yeah.  They're looking at it.  The beginning, the beginning when, yeah, the ship hits the lake.  Yeah.  They get up, they kind of sort themselves out, and then they walk.  That walk is just like a fucking documentary about the desert.  It's a fucking... 
[01:45:30]  It's true.  Yeah, they're just walking around the desert.  Play it.  Lauren Hutton, I'm sorry.  Is this a...  He's driving.  It starts at the credits, huh?  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  It is a good opening song, but I think Ron is right.  They did go, yeah.  It's just different times where people need faster, faster things.  Yeah.  Richard Gere plays a great woman fucking...  He's a great guy who would absolutely fuck your woman and could. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Like, he's a great...  Like, in Eternal Affairs...  Yeah, he had a gerbil in his ass, though.  Yeah, I heard that.  I was like, what is he?  That pound, pound?  He must be so angry that that's still a story.  Exactly.  Like, Richard Gere never has a friend in a movie.  You ever know?  It's like...  Good, yes.  He's just never close enough to anyone to have an actual friend.  I never realized that shit.  There's a coldness to him.  He never has a friend.  You're right.  What's the line he says to Andy Garcia in, uh, Internal Affairs?  Something about your wife. 
[01:46:30]  He goes, how about this?  I'm gonna fuck her in the ass.  I'll teach her how to cum.  And it's like, oh!  Like, you fucking...  Imagine that.  Like, you knew he could do that.  And you feel that.  How that's being said about your woman.  Oh, is he great?  Did you like burn after reading?  Yeah.  Not as much.  No?  Not as much, yeah.  And?  I saw it.  You didn't like it, though?  No, I thought it was alright.  Nothing that's, uh, you know, worth, uh, discussing.  Yeah.  Like Crash.  That's stopping everything.  You're talking about Coen Brothers.  Yeah, well, no one wants to talk about that one.  What are we talking about here?  We're talking about the Coen Brothers, right? 
[01:47:00]  Right.  That's what we're talking about here.  Yeah.  Was that it?  Oh, God, wait.  What are we talking about?  We're talking about the Leeds, right?  All right.  You want the Leeds?  Yes.  Another one I can never not watch.  Yeah.  Holy shit, is that good?  Which one?  Fucking Gary Glenn Ross.  Oh, wow.  Jack Lemmon.  Yeah.  To watch him fucking scold Kevin Spacey and then throw that piece of candy in his mouth.  That motherfucker could act.  Wow, is he good.  He was so fucking brilliant.  Oh.  You shouldn't work with men.  Yeah.  You know what the problem is?  You're an asshole. 
[01:47:30]  Throws it in his mouth and walks.  Fucking master.  Who am I?  Who am I?  This watch costs as much as your car.  That's who I am.  And you are shit.  What's my name?  Fuck you.  That's my name.  You're a good father.  Fuck you.  Take it home.  Alec Baldwin will always be.  Like, he did two minutes in that film that is better than most people's fucking movies.  I can't think of a better cameo ever in a film than him and Gary Glenn Ross. 
[01:48:00]  He just came in, dominated it, and left.  And that was it.  Yeah.  And they were smart, too, because in that movie, the conflict, because Ricky Romo, who  was Pacino, he was not in that scene.  Right.  It was perfect.  And when you look, that conflict would have been too much.  Right.  Because he, because Ricky Romo was on top then.  So he wasn't going to take any of that shit.  Yeah.  Everybody that was in that scene could get fired.  Ricky was the only one who was making his fucking sales money.  So if you put him in there, you would have had one confident guy that would have brought  everybody else. 
[01:48:30]  But everyone else was just taking shit and was only over money.  Yeah.  Nothing else.  And this week's money.  I'm fucking believable how good that movie is.  That was such a, I showed the Broadway.  You saw the play.  I went to the play because it was, uh, Liev Schreiber, I think, played the Ricky Romo role  and Alan Alda.  I just feel like I'm obsessed with Alan Alda.  And he played Shelley.  Who isn't?  Everyone should be, as far as I'm concerned.  Yes.  But, uh, he was good, but he made a really weird character choice.  Uh, Tom Wopat was in it.  And, uh, uh, oh, Jeffrey Tambor.  I forget who Tambor played, uh, as far as I'm concerned. 
[01:49:00]  I'm still getting over the Tom Wopat part.  Yeah.  Wow.  From the Dukes of Hazzard.  Very good, yeah.  Jeffrey Tambor, as far as I'm concerned, should always be throwing plates down a hallway after  shaving his head.  If anybody remembers that justice for all.  Mr. Soans did it again.  Fucking great.  Jeffrey Tambor is one of the great, all-time fucking great actors.  How about the Ropers sitcom?  Remember him in that?  Yeah.  As the fucking, what was he?  The landlord of the Ropers.  Oh my god, the Ropers.  Was that awful?  He's great.  Larry Sanders, when he fucking played that part on Larry Sanders, it might have been the 
[01:49:30]  best thing that's ever happened on TV.  I never saw probably more than five minutes of Larry Sanders.  Really?  I should go back and watch the series.  I've heard it's great.  Yeah.  He is fucking amazing.  Hank Kingsley is the most amazing fucking character that's ever been on TV.  Do you think it would hold up if I got the box set now?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well, all the seasons are on Netflix, if you know that.  It's a total fucking rail on talk shows, so it's just a great goof on.  Yeah, but I don't go for that, though.  Oh, well, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Sorry that you don't go for that. 
[01:50:00]  Nah, just, you know, there's no reason to tear down your house to make my house look  nicer.  We're going to take a break and be around.  What time is it?  Who's coming today, Ron?  You know Mike Paschetti?  No.  Yeah?  Comedian buddy of mine.  Yeah?  Fucking.  I thought you guys were going to have a big...  Big, like, party Friday.  Yeah, but I thought you had a big political guest today, and then she backed out.  Uh, we have Patton Oswalt, but he, uh...  I think he's doing, uh, he's shooting today, I think. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, shooting?  Because of, uh, the weather or something.  Like, like Lee Harvey Oswalt, right?  I thought you had one of your Fox friends.  No, it's not Oswalt.  Uh, really?  Like, um...  I forget who I was told.  Oh, Ann Coulter.  Ann Coulter?  Ann Coulter was going to be here.  Is that her on today?  I saw her, she was on, uh, Hannity last night.  She's probably in bed still.  Yeah.  She hates getting up in the morning.  Oh, you know why?  Oh, I know.  Oh, boy.  Ann Coulter.  Can you chip a fuel bag?  Let me tell you something.  I have never seen a bigger bunch of drunks than at Fox. 
[01:51:00]  Fox News.  It's amazing.  And I guess that...  Look, I've never been over to CNN, but I would think it's the same thing.  Sure.  Uh, it's just that news atmosphere, that whole thing.  They get done, and they go right to the bar.  It's amazing.  I loved it.  The, uh, the thing, too, I've known news people.  They're the only people who really talk to psychics a lot, because I don't think any of  them know exactly what the news business, what makes you popular, and what makes you  not popular. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, in the news.  Yeah.  What is it?  You're just telling the news.  Yeah, you don't know why somebody is like, this person I like, this person I don't like,  this person I trust, this person I don't.  So they're all never sure where the ratings come from.  Oh, this, oh, this, you mean like the experts.  Yeah, like the readers and stuff, like, why somebody would pick Brian Williams over the  other guy reading the news.  Like, here, you know if you have a good show, right?  Yeah.  But if you're in there doing the news, you don't know why one show worked and the other  show doesn't.  So they leave, they get drunk, they call up psychics.  What do you think? 
[01:52:00]  Should I buy this house?  What should I do?  They're all nervous all the time.  I didn't know that.  Another movie, Network.  Oh, yeah, Network's great.  Fuck, maybe the best screenplay of all time.  Well, you see what a genius Paddy Chayefsky was because he foreshadowed fucking reality  TV, like the, what was it, the Symbionium Liberation Army, whatever they were, to see in 1976 that  that is exactly what it was.  That's entertainment.  Fuck.  It's not just fucking craziness.  Yeah.  Not just, yeah.  Amazing.  Or the way, like, hey, look, he was going to, Beals was going to shoot himself. 
[01:52:30]  I can see that now being teased and people being kept on television, you know, maybe  not now, but 20 years from now.  It was brilliant.  Fucking brilliant.  Yeah.  Didn't he die after winning the Oscar, Peter Finch?  Yeah, he never made it to the Oscar.  Oh, he didn't actually.  He died right before the Oscar.  Jeez.  Cost Stallone the fucking thing.  Because Stallone was like, hey, maybe I'll win the Oscar and then the other guy dies.  Fuck you, Stallone.  Ah, yeah, goodbye.  You get nothing.  Was he acting best?  I would have thought Peter Finch was a supporting actor, no?  You might be right.  Because Holden was obviously the lead in that movie, and Helga was fucking, uh, Jesus, 
[01:53:00]  oh, uh, Madness Diana.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Not, uh, it's not Jessica Lange.  Uh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Faye Dunaway.  Faye Dunaway.  Oh, Faye Dunaway.  Yeah, she was amazing.  I was just going to look down until somebody pops the answer.  I think she won for that, too.  She won.  Did she?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeez.  God, the best is when he's, when he's like, she's like, this is, then don't leave.  And her coffee is shaking.  Oh, it was great to watch her fucking come unraveled.  Cunt.  Oh, was she awful.  What was, uh, what was, uh, Stallone up for there? 
[01:53:30]  Lords of Flatbush?  No, Rocky.  Lords of Flatbush.  Lords of Flatbush.  Death Race 2000.  As Machine Gun Joe for Turbo.  Uh, I'll never turn off Lords of Flatbush.  No.  I fucking love the, any stupid 50 movies, I'll watch.  Like the, uh, Wanderers?  Yeah, Wanderers is a great fucking one.  Yeah.  I love the Wanderers, that one.  Yeah.  Dolph, wasn't Dolph Sweet in that?  Was he in that one?  Dolph Sweet?  Yeah, he played the girl's father.  He played somebody's father.  He dropped a bowling ball in somebody's hand.  That was the, uh, Wanderer.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Boyz, and, uh.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  He'll kill you, Perry.  Yeah.  I wonder if, like, any of the listeners have 20 hours a day to fucking watch movies the  way we do.  You know, it really is astounding.  God, these guys watch a lot of movies.  How many movies can be watched in a day?  I, uh, and yesterday, yesterday I got home and just, I crapped right the fuck out.  Ah, if you fought, people know it for a week.  Big man!  You're fucked.  Fuck you, Dave! 
[01:54:30]  Whatever.  The sleeping habits in this job are really fucked up.  Terrible.  Because I could go home and go right to sleep.  Yeah.  And sleep until 10 at night.  I can do that.  Absolutely.  And I did it yesterday.  I woke up a couple of times, but, uh, and then I was up from 10 until I came in.  Like a crazy person.  You're just wandering around, yeah.  Yeah, there's nothing else to do, so I'm watching, I'm watching fucking movies.  Just watching dumb movies.  Movies I've seen, movies I haven't seen.  But there's plenty of time.  Plenty of time to watch television, dumb shows. 
[01:55:00]  You do that and then you look up old girlfriends on the internet?  Who's her?  Who's her?  Facebook, man.  Yeah, man.  I remember her.  She's bad.  They're all hyphenated.  You're like, yeah, you fucking whore.  I'm married.  Yeah.  When I think back, though, I think, like, oh, what am I going to do?  It's a 50-year-old woman.  Right.  A 50-year-old woman.  You know, I'm remembering 19, 19, 1919, actually.  I'm remembering 19.  I'm remembering some of these girls at 19 years old and, you know, fun and just fucking  in a schoolyard somewhere because that was the only place to go. 
[01:55:30]  Like dogs.  Yeah, like dogs.  Like fucking dogs when you're a kid.  Anywhere.  Most people, the first time they fuck is outside.  Yeah.  This is how crazy we are.  It's because there wasn't many opportunities or locations to fuck.  It was hard to get your own apartment when you're in your early or mid-teens.  When we, in my neighborhood, we were such, and now look back on it, it seems scumbaggy.  We would fucking un-park cars.  Like, who would do this? 
[01:56:00]  On them?  Yes.  No, in.  You'd fucking open up and go in.  Oh, that's when people would leave their doors on random cars?  Let's just go up, there's a fucking car unlocked, let's fucking go in.  Go in and fuck in the car.  And then, like, fucking girls lost their virginity in these unlocked cars.  And now you're like, and at the time you're like, this is fucking great.  Come in.  This is perfect.  Holy shit.  We're like, gentlemen here.  Where are the kids fucking these days?  I don't know.  Where are the kids fucking?  I think they're allowed to fuck inside now. 
[01:56:30]  Like, in their house.  In their house, like their mothers.  The parents let them and shit.  Because it was always, like you said, outside.  I remember doing a lot of outdoor fucking.  Yeah.  And you had to do it wherever the opportunity came up.  Because the opportunities weren't, like, every night.  It's like, hey, we can't fuck tonight.  I'll see you tomorrow night.  Yeah.  No.  Like, things had to align.  The planets had to be perfect.  You know, the girl's parents had to let her out.  That'd be a certain movie playing.  Another friend had to say she was coming along.  It was like this big thing that worked out.  And it was like, wow, we're alone. 
[01:57:00]  We have a place to fuck.  And then you did your fucking.  It was very difficult to get a girl and have some sex back then.  Yeah.  I did have a car, though.  So that was kind of an easier thing to do, having your own vehicle.  But it was a big Ford pickup truck.  So there wasn't much room in the bench seat in the front with the steering wheel there on the gear shift.  And I used to park in the woods.  And everyone knew I was there, like my friends. 
[01:57:30]  So I would hear, thank God, this friend of mine, Dave, he had an old Ford Econoline van that just had a horrible valve tick.  So I could hear it just coming from quite some ways away.  And now it's like, shit, I have to get up and zip up because he'd probably fucking start making fun of me or something.  Do you remember the smell of the, like, I remember my friend Dean had a fucking VW van or his Volkswagen car.  And that smell of your friend's car, it was weird.  VWs had distinct smells for some reason.  It was fucking cool, like gasoline or an old smell even back then. 
[01:58:00]  It just was comfortable.  That air-cooled, air-cooled engine that, well, the heat from the engine actually came off your exhaust pipes.  And it was, yeah, it was cowled in and then pumped into the, into the, into your front seat.  It was fucked up because sometimes the exhaust would rot and you'd get, you'd just get exhaust into your.  Be a little fucking headache, but high a little bit from it.  But you're, but cars were so much louder than, like you fucking, now you, you don't even know if your car's on. 
[01:58:30]  You just, you'd turn it.  But then every car had a sound.  Yeah.  And, and, and sometimes a car could be pulling up right behind you and you don't know until it's right there.  That never happened.  No.  And that was a new car.  After a while, things would go wrong with it and you'd always hear like the fan belt.  Right.  Or the fan hitting on something.  Brake squealing.  Things just work better now.  I don't know.  They figured it out.  You don't see rusted cars anymore. 
[01:59:00]  No, you don't.  Fucking rusted cars where everyone's car was rusted.  And when's the last time you just saw like kids working on a car?  It just doesn't happen.  Doesn't happen.  Now you remember there were certain guys in your neighborhood that would just always have a car up on blocks.  Always be doing something.  Yeah.  The motorheads.  Neighbors coming over, looking in.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Never happens.  If you had a question, you'd go over his house and be like, yeah, let me take a look.  And a couple of turns of a screwdriver or something.  Yeah, how's that?  Yeah, you distributed it.  I just adjusted the timing a little bit. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, you don't do that anymore.  Doesn't happen.  None of that shit.  Because there's fucking computers where the engine should be.  Yeah, you got to take it in and they plug a fucking, something that plugs into your computer.  They did download shots of your thing to upgrade your, whatever, your system.  Yeah, you can actually get more power out of your vehicle.  They just program it different.  It gives you more horsepower.  But what is gone is any romance about any of it.  Yeah.  Like, no one cares.  Now it's just, buy a car, drive it.  Yeah, the romance is gone. 
[02:00:00]  That whole thing.  The love affair of the person in their car.  That thing's gone.  It's because you became attached to it because you knew you were going to have it until you were fucking 37.  Now nobody gives a shit because they're all in halfway decent shape and leasing is a little better.  Well, like, Amp brought up the rusting.  These fucking things are plastic now.  You know what I mean?  There's no, they just fucking take out the whole quarter panel to put something else in there.  It's changed.  Yeah, yeah.  And you got to go with that true coat.  Yeah.  You got that true coat put in there.  You're not fucking patching it up yourself to try to make it last to a fucking winner. 
[02:00:30]  With some of that fucking, yeah.  What do you used to put in there?  Bondo?  Yeah, it was like Bondo.  It was like some kind of thing.  And then you'd try to spray paint and never be able to match.  Well, you're good.  Everyone was a half-assed mechanic, though.  Yeah.  Like, you were always, my tool set was like a butter knife.  Yeah.  And fucking a nutcracker for pliers.  I'd go in the drawers of where the fucking utensils were.  It's like, yeah, I need a nutcracker for some fucking pliers.  Don't break that.  Bring it back. 
[02:01:00]  Every knife we had had a quarter-turn twist on the end of it.  Mom would get all pissed at.  But, yeah, there was something kind of nostalgic about that that just doesn't happen anymore.  And it's probably good, because now, if my car broke down as much as my old one did, I'd fucking...  You'd kill yourself now.  It was so awful when your car broke down.  And no cell phones to call your buddy.  No.  You'd just have to walk somewhere.  A lot of those fucking cars, too.  They'd break down, and you'd just get out and take your fucking license off the back and leave. 
[02:01:30]  Take the place off.  Fuck this thing.  Well, you don't see the cars just parked and left on the side of the expressway and parkways anymore.  Growing up, when I used to go into the city with my parents and shit, you'd look, and the second you crossed that Nassau-Queens border,  it was just abandoned cars, like fucking Road Warrior.  It really was.  Fucking New York looked so fucking scary then.  Yeah.  It was petrifying for a kid when we used to go on field trips. 
[02:02:00]  We'd go to, like, the Museum of Natural History, and they'd load the school bus up in wonderful Suffolk County,  which at the time was whiter than white, and take us into the city.  And the second we would get through the Queens, you know, over into Queens, you'd start seeing abandoned cars.  But then you'd pull into the Midtown Tunnel, and the second the bus came out of the Midtown Tunnel,  it was just this, it was like, you know, Alice in Wonderland.  You were petrified.  And I was petrified of getting lost and left behind and shit like that. 
[02:02:30]  Would you panic when you came to the city?  I'd panic in the city.  I'd have to keep an eye on any of the field trip moms that were there and the teacher.  And if one got out of sight of me, I'd run and have to run up.  And, yeah, I was such a fucking pussy.  Well, cities were fucking crazy in those days.  Back then, they were crazy.  Every fucking city was scary.  And, you know, they give Giuliani all the credit for bringing back New York, right?  But then how did, like, you know, Philly and fucking Baltimore and all these other cities come back? 
[02:03:00]  Because every city, Chicago, doesn't matter where you went.  Oh, there's big buildings, so there's massive amounts of crime.  Just massive amounts of crime.  Yeah, and when you would be brought in as a kid, how they would try to shield you from the sexual content that was just emblazoned on every window, billboards, and they couldn't protect you.  They didn't even try to back then.  Yeah.  It was just part of what the deal was.  This is the city.  There's a fucking picture in a window, a neon sign, a woman, spread eagle. 
[02:03:30]  And 200 plastic dicks.  And you're like, I still haven't worked everything else.  And you're like, where does the plastic dick go?  You know, you hadn't, you didn't know everything sexually.  You haven't worked that through as a kid yet.  Yeah.  You don't know what the fuck that is.  Even squeegee, even squeegee people.  It's like, I forgot that they existed.  They were fucking scary shit to a little kid.  They were horrendous.  They were scary.  There's a guy fucking leaning on over the car while your dad's saying no.  Your dad's yelling at him, yeah.  When people don't listen to your dad when you're a little kid, you're like, oh shit. 
[02:04:00]  How are you not listening to my dad?  Everything is broken down.  Any fucking thing that we thought is like.  It's fucking crazy, you're right.  They don't listen to dads here.  How do they not listen to dads?  Like, dad could yell at anybody at home.  My friends, they'd all listen.  Shut up.  Get out of there.  All right.  And they would leave.  This guy wouldn't fucking leave the windshield.  I always thought it must be awful for a kid to see his father get knocked out.  How awful that must be to see your dad get knocked out in public.  Like, especially if he's a tough guy at home.  See somebody fucking just put him on the floor. 
[02:04:30]  What was the worst thing?  Did you ever see your dad in a position where you're like, oh boy, that's not good.  Like see him at work or something or someone's just running him down?  Just someone.  Yeah, I saw two things that were pretty like, oh God, that was terrible.  I went into work with my dad once.  He worked at Joachim Flanzek and Weissman over in Mineola.  The law firm of Joachim Flanzek and Weissman.  And he was an investigator for them, an insurance investigator.  And he'd come home and it was cool as fuck. 
[02:05:00]  He'd take his jacket off and he'd have a gun on his hip.  And I'm just like, ah, that's fucking cool.  That's dad.  And he's a private eye and it's cool.  It's like Mannix.  And he goes in and he took me in with him one day.  It's like, yeah, come take a ride with me.  Didn't have a busy day or anything.  Most of the day was spent in a bar, of course.  So he takes me in and I guess Joachim had had a problem with Joey that day, the day before.  I guess my dad might have left a job early with Jimmy, his buddy, to hit up a bar or something. 
[02:05:30]  And they made me sit out in the waiting room in front of Joachim's office.  But I could hear everything in there.  And all I heard was Joachim going, God damn fucking Joey, you got to show some fucking responsibility.  I'll throw your ass out.  And I'm just sitting there like, oh, dad's being yelled at.  My dad's being yelled at like he yells at me.  Was he yelling back the way he yells at you?  No, no.  I didn't hear a peep out of him.  Not a peep. 
[02:06:00]  He knew he was in the wrong.  Oh, yeah.  And then when he opened the door, he was like smiling like, all right, come on, let's go.  Like trying to make it all better.  And I was just looking like, oh, you got bitched.  Fucking bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then the second time it was even worse.  He had an old Le Mans, a red Le Mans, which is pretty nice.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah.  I think he wanted to be Maddox.  And he had this old Le Mans and it caught fire.  So he lifted the hood up and tried to put the fire out and wound up burning his hands. 
[02:06:30]  So this is when my mother and him were already separated.  So but he like put the fire out, was able to drive the car actually back over to the house.  But his hands were all burnt.  So he was soaking him in the in the sink.  And mom was there like helping him because he was like really a mess.  And I went, Daddy, are you OK?  And he turned around.  He had tears running down his face.  He goes, get the fuck out of here.  But I knew he was crying.  And I go, oh, bro, oh, shit.  I should have told him what he told me all the time.  Stop with the pissy eyes. 
[02:07:00]  He's knocking over.  I'll really give you something to cry about.  He had great things for when I was crying.  It just the way they fucking turned tears for masculinity, though.  Oh, boy.  My fucking my dad and my big brother hated any kind of sensitivity, anything, any kind  of sensitivity at all.  They fucking despised it.  Oh, yeah.  Were they huggers?  No.  But the whole thing of like, what are you listening to fucking music, you little girl?  Like anything at all that came up?  What are you reading a book?  What are you doing there? 
[02:07:30]  What is that?  You want to dress with that?  Like a girl?  What would you do that your brother thought was feminine?  Anything.  Just fucking using a fork.  Anything at all.  Anything at all.  That's like the father in Saturday Night Fever when Tony Manero's picking up the plates  from the table.  He goes, what are you doing?  I'm helping out, bringing the plates into the...  Because that's a girl's job.  Put that down.  Sit down.  We'll talk.  One pork chop.  One pork chop.  One pork chop.  Yeah.  Five dollars.  You know, five dollars buys you, doesn't even buy you one dollar. 
[02:08:00]  That was actually the perfect, I think, 70s New York movie.  Oh, yeah.  Because it was like done in real time.  Like, Saturday Night Fever is the only fucking nostalgic movie, but was done while people  were looking at it.  It wasn't like a look back at what New York was.  It was like the exact moment.  It's really hard to pull off.  The disco thing.  The fucking, the way the city looked.  The Brooklyn, Manhattan thing.  Yeah, that was.  The subway.  Remember just how disgusting and ugly the subway was? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  And how Brooklyn just looked at Manhattan as if it was somewhere else.  Yeah, this magical place.  You couldn't get there for some reason.  I don't know why they had to go to that shitty Brooklyn disco.  Why didn't they go to Manhattan?  For 50 cents.  You get on the train.  You can go anywhere you want.  You're there.  What the fuck?  They'd stand there on that dumb bridge looking.  Staring over.  Hey, we never took that break, did we?  No, we didn't.  It gives a shit, right?  Fuck breaks.  Yeah.  We'll load them up during the shit show. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, that's what I say.  After show.  We load them up.  We'll take a little break and we'll be right back.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'm a truck driver and I just want to say, fuck you.  There's a manager of the store that told me to be there at 4 a.m., not 4.01.  I get there at 3.45 and you don't show up till 4.30.  Talk about, oops, I overslept. 
[02:09:30]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I like to say a big fuck you to golf.  Put my balls off, drinking and smoking, hitting balls on the golf course.  For once, man, when a fucking ball goes straight, shooting my boys, trying to fucking impress.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you to both my wife and Jimmy Norton.  Number one being my wife for struggling so much when I try to pinch her nose and fart her mouth.  And then a fuck you to Jim Norton for not giving me a good method of doing it.  Fuck you both.  Fuck you. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, this is a few goes out the boss.  Dude, chewing gum on the radio.  How long have you been on that gum?  You know that nicotine is seeping into your jaw through your gum line?  You're going to look like that dude Ebert.  Yeah, Roger Ebert.  You're going to look like him.  You know what your ass is going to sound like on stage?  Does anybody want to buy a dryer door?  Uh, uh, a few of us.  Fuck you.  This FU goes out to Les Zeppelin.  Claiming to be like Les Zeppelin is like the WNBA claiming to be the NBA. 
[02:10:30]  Not good.  It's like dudes playing left-handed.  That's you, Les Zeppelin.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big fuck you to Governor Rick Scott, an alien-looking motherfucker, for cutting teacher's salary by 3% while using taxpayer money to put your name on the Florida welcome sign.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to say a big fuck you to God for putting something as wonderful as a pussy on something as horrible as a fucking woman. 
[02:11:00]  I bet you think it's real funny if they're sniffing at your asshole.  A lot of guys got to put all this fucking bullshit.  Just go stick our dick in a warm, wet hole.  Fuck you, God.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this FU goes out to my stupid, cunt wife.  First, you fall asleep on the fucking couch while I'm at work, and then I come home and find that our daughter chopped all her fucking hair off with a pair of scissors, and then you find a way to blame me for it, then you throw me out of my own house, then while I'm out getting drunk at a bar trying to drink away my fucking sorrows because of your sorry ass, you call me back saying, 
[02:11:30]  you gotta come back, we got an appointment to get her hair cut.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  The virus.  Serious.  Serious.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, look at this.  Very nostalgic.  Yes.  Today with the music, E-Rock.  We're back with Norton and friends.  Norton.  Anthony Comey is sitting in today.  Ron Bennington, of course.  Yes.  And Sam, my pal, Mike Bacchetti entering the studio.  Comedians, of course.  How you doing, Mike?  Mike?  He's having trouble getting onto the seat.  Mike's a big boy. 
[02:12:30]  Mike is a big boy.  Go ahead.  Who are you talking about, Mike?  He's supposed to boost himself up there.  He's not going to put his headphones on.  Headphones on.  Getting in the chair and then the microphone.  Very difficult.  Are you falling off of the edge of the chair there?  You need a seatbelt?  Look at your seatbelt.  I knew Jim 150 pounds ago.  Believe me.  Yeah, you got a little bigger.  Yeah, you've known each other for a while.  How long have I known you?  15 years?  20 years.  Holy shit.  20 years.  I met you with a Grandpa Monsters open mic. 
[02:13:00]  Fuck yeah.  Staten Island.  Grandpa's?  Yeah, there was a great game at that club.  Yeah, yeah.  It would actually open with the theme music from the month.  It was the best opening.  But it would open.  To me, we were new back then.  And the show, the lights would go out.  You'd hear, boom.  I'm sure it was infringing on somebody's copyright.  Probably, but I don't think anybody went and, you know,  not going to court me.  Fucking Staten Island.  Where are you living?  Same place, really.  Pretty much with my mom.  Oh, really? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, it sucks.  I'm hoping to get some more cash and get out.  You on the road doing gigs?  Uh, not really.  I'm like the Jackie Robertson of comedy.  What is that?  What do you mean?  I mean, you know, it's like, I feel like you've been a great friend of me.  Some other people have.  It's just some, you know, things in the city.  It's ridiculous.  Right.  Oh, you mean you're having trouble breaking in?  After 20 years, yeah.  Oh, Jackie.  Oh, okay.  Now I got it.  I'm thinking post, like, when he got in.  But it's before he got in.  It's still the same. 
[02:14:00]  I mean, nobody is.  I'd use Satchel Paige, but that's because he got in when he was older.  Well, Jimmy could fucking do some breaks for you, couldn't you?  I don't really have that much juice.  I mean, all the comics know Mike.  I mean, we've all worked with him for you.  He's a funny stand-up, man.  Yeah.  Mike's a funny fucking stand-up.  I appreciate being on here today, guys.  Thanks.  I was excited about it.  I don't worry about it.  Actually, it's Friday before vacation.  It really doesn't mean anything.  It's, to be quite honest with you, I'm surprised I'm here today.  Oh, God. 
[02:14:30]  And now the storm is, I don't know, these idiots got hyped up, all kinds of bullshit.  I'm not worried until it happens.  No.  Staten Island is low land, though, right?  You've got to worry, Staten Island.  I live by the train station, so I'm not too bad.  It's uphill.  It's uphill.  How long does it take you to get into this?  Mike would fucking commute for hours to get into the city and get home after a gig.  Now, I don't even care, Jim.  I just take the express bus.  I caught it on 49th and 6th.  I'm home in about an hour and ten.  But before that, guys, it was like a mile walk to the train, the ferry, the boat, fucking get in the subway. 
[02:15:00]  It was ridiculous.  Making all kinds of transportation.  I know people who got back home to Baltimore before I did.  Should have moved to Baltimore.  I love Mike.  I really do love you.  Grandpa Munster used to host?  No.  Would he ever show up there, Al Lewis?  You know, occasionally.  It's just like how often Jack O'Lane showed up.  You know what I mean?  It's the same shit, really.  I don't think he'd be there.  Jack O'Lane had a comedy club?  Yes, he did. 
[02:15:30]  Never knew that.  He had to be in really good shape before he worked there.  And guys like Jack O'Robinson were not allowed in, if you know what I mean.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  That's still Tony Soprano landing there.  Is that right?  Calisthenics.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking Staten Island.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know who owned Grandpa's.  I mean, the guys I knew were very legit.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a well-run establishment.  Back in those days.  Back in the, uh, it was 1990, 92.  That's right.  Boy, Gary, for the first time, he hosted a contest there or something.  Oh, yeah.  That's right. 
[02:16:00]  Because we were on, you had just won the Bud Light contest, I remember.  I got a great memory.  It's like January of 1991, I met you the first time.  Wow.  That's right.  You remember that clip I show you where I think I'm Italian?  No, I didn't.  I might have won a segment of it.  It was Bud Light, and I was opening up with joke jokes and talking about, you were trying  to fuck when you were drunk.  It was just an awful joke that I stole from a 12-step meeting I heard.  And I thought I was kind of an Italian guy.  It was fucking horrible.  Oh, did you put on kind of an attitude? 
[02:16:30]  Like, hey, yeah.  What are you guys doing?  It was terrible.  How you doing?  Hey.  You went through a lot of voices and little, like, characters before you just were Jimmy  Norton.  Yeah, it's fucking humiliating.  I like this voice, guy.  Yeah, that's when people told me you had to be likable.  You remember those obsessions?  Oh, all those idiots in the network were like, must be likable and have eight minutes  of saturated, clean bullshit, really.  Likeable?  What does that even mean?  Like, you had to put a voice on to be likable?  I thought so. 
[02:17:00]  I was high energy.  I wanted to be loved.  It's disgusting.  No, but you always had super quick with references.  That's why I loved your work.  Like, you're always, like, on top of everything that was going on.  You know what I mean?  It was awesome.  As time went on a little bit, you know, but, you know, sometimes my references wouldn't  work.  Like, I would try to be the hip New York guy in, like, 95, and I went to Vail.  So I had opened up.  I'm embarrassed now by this.  But I won a contest.  And I'm, like, I'm actually squinting my eye because I'm embarrassed.  Yeah.  But I said something off the cuff about how I'm not going to win this contest and go to 
[02:17:30]  Vail.  I said something about I had a better shot at going to the moon in a yellow sundress.  And it got a big laugh because it was genuinely off the cuff.  It's funny, yeah.  But when I tried to reinvent it in Vail.  In a yellow sundress.  Yeah.  Like, I didn't think I'd make it here.  But how many times are you going to say it?  I love watching that shit.  Fucking awful bomb. 
[02:18:00]  It's like the fucking foreign guy that always says the word wrong.  Like, you know, oh, you know, it's, I live in the jungle, has it, tat?  And you're like, oh, he means habitat.  Then he corrects himself and has eight jokes for it.  Oh, God.  So you don't, you're not gigging, though?  I'm working on a lot of things on my own now.  I produced a show on Adam.com called The Mike Buschetti Show.  So we had like about 100,000 hits our first season.  But I want to produce more stuff.  Yeah.  Get in movies and TV more, really. 
[02:18:30]  You don't want to be in it?  No, I am in it.  But I want to produce it and own it.  You know what I mean?  What was The Mike Buschetti Show?  It was like a, like a bad spoof on an internet show.  Two guys, me and my friend Kenny shot it.  We shot it for about a year.  I just thought something new called Drop in Science.  I play a scientist.  Jesus.  That's typecasting.  Mike does not look or act or sound like a scientist.  Well, I'm trying my best.  What is the, what is this, the push of this one? 
[02:19:00]  Just to get as much, somebody to grab it, give me some cash and move on to other stuff.  Okay.  So that's the gist.  Fuck the storyline, anything else.  It's all just about money.  Just get some cash.  Skanks and money.  That's my, oh God.  I can't wait to have all kinds of bimbos when the cash comes in.  Yeah.  Mike is a bit of just obsessed with getting famous for years so he can fuck anything that  walks.  Oh, really?  He's still a prostitute guy?  Uh, I haven't seen any recently.  So that's what you two have in common. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's how you met.  Hookers are our specialty.  We love them.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody told me a story about you yesterday because I said you were coming in.  I forget what comic it was.  And it might have been Keith Robinson who said years ago at the New York Comedy Club they  were going to get you a hooker or something.  Oh, they did.  And you were in the basement.  It was ridiculous.  It was like, um, this is back in like 96, I think it was.  Uh, the owner sends out another comic and they're looking for hookers.  He was looking at hookers like Lexington Avenue, I think it was, wherever he bought them back. 
[02:20:00]  Right.  And the owner said to me, she's going to bang you and she's going to blow you.  I'm like, yeah.  So I'm waiting in the back.  I got all undressed ready for this to happen.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that sounds bad.  Right.  I'm all undressed waiting for it to happen.  Right.  So the owner says to the girl how much she gives it, a hundred.  He goes, that's a little too much.  How about you just blow it?  Meanwhile, I'm fucking naked, ready for everything to happen.  Oh, yeah.  Keith said they walked in and you were just nude in the basement.  Oh, shit.  Uh, pretty much. 
[02:20:30]  I had like.  It wasn't a hurry.  I thought I was going to bang her.  And then my other friend that was getting, getting sex with the hookers came like a fucking  rocket like this.  And then they left.  I'm fucking standing there naked after she, she did me.  Oh, you blew me.  That's it.  Nice.  Did you finish that?  No, she was fucking skankalicious.  She was, oh, fuck.  Well, you got it.  You see the street broads, you know, I stay away from.  You get what you pay for, you know?  Yeah.  Some of those girls.  She wasn't thrilled either, Mike.  Let's be honest.  She might have been. 
[02:21:00]  I don't know.  I used to go to a place in the city.  There was a place in the city I used to go to all the time in the 80s, 90s.  We did have like old housewives hanging on like some hot chicks once in a while.  It was only like 10 bucks.  10 bucks?  What would you get for that?  Half and half.  There used to be this.  What's half and half?  You know, you fuck her and she sucks your dick.  What?  You got to stop fucking her, though?  It's five dollars each.  Five dollars each.  Five dollars each.  I just went for the head job. 
[02:21:30]  That's it.  What if you came fucking her?  That was it.  I mean, that was.  You got $3.30 and change.  Did they make change?  Yeah, for the manager.  She makes change out her asshole.  They don't make my name after a while, really.  It was awesome.  Oh, that's great.  Ten dollars sounds like it would be Bangkok, though.  It doesn't even seem like it could happen in America.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  Well, this was like when the city was still a wild west zone.  You know what I mean?  Like in the early 80s.  It was down by like, by Alphabet City.  Yeah, we were talking about those good old days.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:22:00]  When it was just a catastrophe.  Hookers walking all over the place.  West Side was amazing.  You drive down the West Side Highway now.  You look at the beautiful gardens in between the lanes of the highway.  Back then, it was just fucking hookers.  I think there was an elevated.  Wasn't there something elevated above the fucking highway?  Yeah, that's exactly where it's like a park now, where they've taken that thing downtown.  They've made it into a little walking park.  Yeah, but then it was just badass fucking hookers and pimps. 
[02:22:30]  Well, Mike just used what was the scariest term ever, Alphabet City.  Alphabet City.  Would always never go into Alphabet City.  Yes.  Don't go past A.  Everybody was scared to death of that part of time.  I still won't go past B.  It's fucked up over there.  Really, still?  You don't get bothered, though.  You look like a fucking lunatic.  Don't be bothered.  I need to get taken as a mob guy or a cop if I have my hair cut short enough.  Really?  People think you're a cop?  Yeah, some people, you know, a lot of friends of mine, black people tell me they look like  a gangster or a cop to them.  So that's good. 
[02:23:00]  I'm safe in the hood.  When's the last time you were beaten up publicly?  Probably back in junior high, if that's considered a movie.  I thought you were going to go probably back like a couple of months ago or something.  No, no, no.  I ask because you travel.  You know, you take mass transit for 30 years.  Yeah.  I like to fly, though.  That's awesome.  I love to fly when I can.  It's so exciting.  I love to really enjoy it.  Yeah.  The person next to you must not like it.  Just saying.  No, I try to get a window seat.  This way I can just look out and not talk to anybody, really. 
[02:23:30]  Just enjoy the flight.  Yeah.  It is a miracle.  I'm just, you know, I'm just looking at the clock at this point.  No, I, uh, before I started flying a lot, uh, you know, with my job and everything, uh,  I, I would, I, I would stay up the entire flight and just be amazed at what was going  on.  I'd get the window seat and look out every inch of the ground going by and, and now it's  just, I take it for granted. 
[02:24:00]  It's like, why the fuck aren't we taking off?  Jesus Christ.  We're sitting here 10 minutes.  It really is weird how you lose that.  Like, uh, wonder.  I remember the horror I had.  I was actually going to that veil festival we talked about and I was so scared to fly  back then.  And, uh, we take it, I was in a middle seat in coach on a United flight and I'll never  forget the old lady next to me.  Her, she had fucking dumpster breath and there was a black woman next to me and we took off  and she's like, New Jersey is an ugly state from the air.  And we banked and I just looked down and I was like, we're going to fucking die. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, when you were a little kid, that was the fucking time.  Like the, the first couple of flights was the most exciting point of your whole life.  You can't do better.  You really can.  You're right.  And even before that, I remember we would go to the airport, like as a family, just  to go up to the airport and just to look at the planes, take off.  It would be like an exciting thing for a little kid.  I was put on planes as like a little kid to go to California and, uh, with, with no supervision 
[02:25:00]  and they're just like, yeah, the stew will take care of you.  The sexy, the sexy stew.  And they, they would, they do, you know, they'd come and check on you and shit.  And I'd be like sitting there all by myself, like 11 years old or something.  I did the same thing at 11.  I had to actually change flights in fucking Chicago by myself.  And, uh, like they would, now they would fucking take you away from your parents.  Yeah.  You'd be, you'd be taken away.  Then it was just kind of like, oh yeah, it's over there.  Okay.  You got big, one of those big old Samsonite suitcases. 
[02:25:30]  Nothing with wheels back then either.  Everything was hard shell fucking with that one handle, no wheels.  Now there's kids rolling their luggage everywhere.  I can remember carrying when I started opening for Dyson, whatever year that was.  And I'm, I'm what?  99, maybe?  No, 97.  97.  I'm running through the airport with his other bodyguard, Happy Face.  Yes.  We had to change airlines from like continental to America.  And I had two bags that I would carry and I would always travel with my own pillow.  Uh, cause I was like, I guess I liked to sleep on my own pillow, so I would fucking bite 
[02:26:00]  it in the hotel room.  Oh God.  And, uh, I would always carry my own pillow with it when I traveled.  Oh boy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you know, those little airline pillows and the peanuts.  What about those peanuts?  No, but I liked it for the hotel, not the flight.  Yeah, of course.  I would check my bags.  I liked it for the food.  At least they gave you stuff years ago.  You get big bags of stuff from American Airlines, you know what I mean?  Like, they're treating you good.  Now you've got a fucking bag of peanuts on a nine hour flight. 
[02:26:30]  We just sound like old people.  We're just like, you know, back in the old days.  A dollar was a dollar.  It was great.  You're glad to have it.  It was great back then.  You go on a plane, you could smoke, fucking pull a gun.  It didn't matter what the fuck happened.  What airline do you fly, Michael?  You don't care.  I don't give a shit as long as I get there, really.  It don't matter to me.  He loves to fly.  He loves to fly.  I used to be afraid of it, though, like you guys were talking earlier.  Like, in the mid-90s, the first time I went to California, I was like, sitting there like 
[02:27:00]  this.  Didn't move for like fucking five hours.  I was so terrified.  Then I just got a little more used to it.  Then I just sat by the window.  I love takeoff.  My favorite part.  That's my least favorite part.  I hate land.  I'm scared to shoot a landing.  I'm just the opposite.  We ought to do a show about that.  Why, you two.  Oh, come on now.  Yeah, he likes it hot and I like it cold.  What is the big thing that you don't like about land?  Because you're getting higher.  I don't know. 
[02:27:30]  Because you're leaving the ground, the comfort of not crashing.  Oh, so you don't...  Every second is you're closer to falling.  No.  I like the fucking landing because the ground is coming closer.  That is closer just to being in a nice car accident.  Yeah.  A nice 150-mile-an-hour car accident.  Yeah, I don't mind rolling in a fucking flaming ball down the runway.  That's fairly comforting.  You just don't like the idea of the falling part and the horror that it must be to go from 
[02:28:00]  35,000 feet to impact because you got a lot of time on your hands there.  Dude, you can actually, like, scream and then breathe again.  Oh, quite a few times depending on what the plane's doing.  Fuck, man.  You talked about that flight that went upside down.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they had a little problem, I gather.  The guy couldn't get the elevator up to the point where he could put the aircraft in a  climb and didn't have enough power.  So the plane rolled over on its back and he was able to get enough lift at that point because 
[02:28:30]  now it's a down elevator which pushes the nose of the plane up because he's upside down.  So they were able to actually fly upside down for a little while, but they knew they were  doomed.  There's nothing you could do about it.  But it would be great if you were the guy that never stopped reading.  Like, everybody else is screaming.  You're just reading.  Or you ring the thing for the stewardess.  Boom.  Yeah.  Boom.  You're like, yeah, can I get a drink over here?  Yeah.  You're just business as usual. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, my coffee's on the ceiling.  You just start smoking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  And then the stewardess turns it around and he's going, you have to put that out, sir.  It's not allowed on this flight.  We're flying upside down.  Do you think like back at the turn of the century, like people used to say I'm afraid  of cars.  Like, I don't mind when it starts.  But when he starts to hit the brake, just like the early drives.  The horseless carriage.  I don't know.  That thing does like 15 miles an hour.  It's crazy.  Some people are just like, I won't get into cars. 
[02:29:30]  I'm sorry.  No matter how long it takes me.  I have a fear of, yeah.  I don't mind pulling away from, not even curbs.  Didn't even have curbs back then, didn't they?  Yeah, the Negro.  How am I pulling away from the Negro?  Oh, it's time for a vacation then.  Oh, it certainly is.  I have a little lawn jockey in my backyard.  Keith, the cop, put it on my front lawn while I was away on vacation.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:30:00]  So I pulled up to that.  And I just decided it was a good place to put it in the backyard by the jacuzzi where  there's a lot of vegetation and shit.  It's kind of hidden away a little bit.  But I had a couple of gentlemen over my house the other day that were there to fix the light  in my pool.  And they were gentlemen of color.  And I know they saw it.  And all I'm thinking is how they just left 220 volt AC wires in my pool just waiting for  dumb Whitey with his fucking Jim Crow ornament. 
[02:30:30]  That was the 2011 version of Kizzy giving you water.  Yeah, they're just spitting in my pool.  Yeah.  I don't know.  The lawn jockey got a bad rap.  What is it about that?  They still have it at the 21 Club right around the corner.  There's still a bunch of lawn jockeys out there.  There's still a bunch of lawn jockeys at the 21 Club.  There's an old restaurant in New York.  The lawn jockeys are still out there. 
[02:31:00]  I think they got them grandfathered in, though.  You can grandfather in some racist shit.  You just can't like...  No one can put up new lawn jockeys in front of a restaurant.  But the old ones, it's like it's endearing.  There was someone that will try to paint the face white.  You'll just see.  It looks silly.  There's some white wash over it.  The lips.  But they look...  I don't know what...  Either he used to be black or he's a white burn victim.  Am I naive or just very racist or a little of both? 
[02:31:30]  You're both.  Oh.  Like, what is offensive about the lawn jockey?  I think it wasn't so much that they were actually jockeys,  but they used to dress guys up like that at the clubs down south.  So you would be dressed as a jockey, you know,  taking people's coats off or serving them or whatever.  Oh, okay.  So it's not a real jockey.  I don't think so.  But you're dressed like one is like a gag.  Right.  Sort of like for the upper echelon white people, 
[02:32:00]  they'd bring them over the...  This might be just a great leap on my part there.  Really?  Are you just...  Yeah.  But I really think it had something to do with like...  It's almost like servant's clothes.  Oh, okay.  It doesn't symbolize a great time...  No matter...  When you look at a lawn jockey,  you know that was not a proud moment.  Yeah.  Like that's symbolizing.  You just instinctively know.  What if I put a statue that was the same size of a lawn jockey and shit on my lawn,  but it was of like George Washington Carver?  Would that be offensive?  No, it would be a tribute, I think. 
[02:32:30]  But I think people would look at it as like,  look what he's doing.  Or Frederick Douglass.  Mike's backing up on this.  I don't know that.  No, you're not feeling it.  You're not feeling it 100% sure.  Well, it depends what part of the country you put it in, you know?  Well, that's true, too.  I would think like a Harriet Tubman, a Frederick Douglass, and the peanut guy.  George Washington Carver.  I actually think that a lot of these little white kids are racist now with this,  I'm allergic to peanuts.  Oh, is that just trying to... 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, they're never allergic to any white people nuts.  That's true.  Just that peanut.  They're trying to discount what this man did for us.  Yeah, when they found out his fucking hands were all over it,  all of a sudden they sneeze.  I don't know.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  Did anyone that you went to school with have a peanut allergy?  No, my manager Jonathan does,  and I'm obsessed with shoving peanuts in his face.  He always asks, is there peanuts in it?  It's fucking soup, you asshole.  Did he as a kid?  I don't know.  Probably he's neurotic. 
[02:33:30]  I don't know one kid that had an allergy to anything back then.  It was hay fever.  You sneezed.  That was the only allergies.  Now they can't even be in the same room as a peanut.  If the peanut is in the room, they could get sick.  Yeah.  What happened over the course of a couple of decades?  Something with the peanut dust.  There's triglycerides in peanut dust,  and that's what gets in people's nostrils.  But why now?  I just made that up.  Of course, I could look at you and know he's lying.  I like to look back to this.  I think because so many women in the 50s is like when people started eating peanut butter, 
[02:34:00]  memory and peanut butter, that after a while they just fucking overdosed on it,  and their kids are allergic to it.  Like we've eaten so much peanut butter as people, and we weren't supposed to.  It wasn't a food to begin with.  Or you could look at it the other way and say back then they ate a lot of peanut butter,  and the children that were born were immune to any kind of allergy.  And then when we stopped eating a lot of peanut butter like now,  because there's other things to eat, the kids got allergic. 
[02:34:30]  It just came on us in no time.  It really did.  It came out of nowhere.  I blame it on the inoculations.  Or maybe back then people were just dying of peanut allergies when we thought it was other stuff.  That could be true, too.  That was polio.  They really weren't.  It was all peanuts.  Give that kid a cigarette.  Send him home.  They'll be fine.  They didn't realize that every kid that died of SIDS had a fucking PB and J in his hand.  That actually is true.  How many things did people die of that they didn't know?  They just had no clue, and now they figured out it's an allergy. 
[02:35:00]  Because a lot of people used to die of like 38 and 40, and they'd call it natural causes.  Yes.  He died of natural causes.  Really?  Natural?  That's just life being life.  And they decided to take a look inside and realize, oh, that's it.  Pancreas looks like charcoal.  Of course.  He was 30.  His liver started giving out.  Yeah.  My favorite's always been the doctors in the cigarette ads.  Now, I don't remember these people.  Don't give me the old Anthony bit. 
[02:35:30]  But I do remember cigarette commercials.  But I don't remember when doctors were endorsing cigarettes.  They said it was good for stress.  No, no, no.  I don't remember.  The doctors would be like, yeah.  Nine out of ten doctors say that this has a smooth pull.  A smooth pull.  And it doesn't hurt the throat.  You know, it's not sharp.  They use these words.  I didn't even know what the fuck they were.  But I do remember the ones for Doral.  Doral was like, taste me, taste me. 
[02:36:00]  Come on and taste me.  Take a puff and let me do my stuff.  It was like singing cigarettes.  You were a little kid singing along with it?  I would.  I would sing along to the cigarette.  Yeah.  There was once.  And then there was the Virginia Slims, I think it was.  You've come a long way, baby.  To get where you got to today.  You got your own cigarette now, baby.  You've come a long, long way.  And then the husband comes in and punches her in the face. 
[02:36:30]  Because dinner's cold.  Puts a cigarette out in her eye.  And Tijuana Smalls.  I think it was after you couldn't have cigarette ads on anymore.  But before you couldn't have like cigarillos and little cigars.  Faking as it was a tiny cigar.  And like Magnum P.I. was selling these fucking like tipperillo type things.  Tijuana Smalls.  Yeah.  Sounds like a gangster.  Anthony, they have a...  What not? 
[02:37:00]  I've seen a recent one.  They had the Flintstones selling cigars.  Oh, yeah.  Selling the Winston.  It freaked me out to see Bonnie and Fred smoking a Winston.  I'm like, what the hell is that?  It's like, hey, hey, Winston tastes good like a cigarette should, Bon.  And then it's like fucking kids are watching this.  But, yeah, they had a really twisted sense of marketing.  That's why when now they try to say like, this is bad for kids.  It influences children.  And it's so distant from children that it's like, stop. 
[02:37:30]  You're being stupid.  Look back in the old days where it was like, that was, that was selling to kids.  Well, why did we do even a thing where, why is it because as a kid that's the most important  thing?  Like, why do we like, well, this is bad for kids.  Yeah.  Why does that matter any more than anything else?  Right.  Who cares?  Yeah.  I don't.  I don't have kids.  I don't have to fucking be kids safe.  It's great.  Well, I think they feel that kids are more easily influenced and their behavior will be 
[02:38:00]  more easily influenced by certain suggestive advertising.  I hate them.  I don't disagree.  No.  I'm only saying what they would say.  I'm with you.  Fuck them.  I mean, the kids have the future, right?  Yeah.  Hold on then.  That'll be your time.  That'll be your time.  God, like Goonies.  Yeah.  Instead of just like, well, let's do something nice for the kids.  But what gets to me is why the fucking people like I see that people would want to keep  like, oh, I want to feel like I'm 19, 20, 25.  But why do people want to act like they're fucking 11 or 12 now? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Like, why do people want to still go to cartoons when you're an adult?  I think they're fucking, I hear Hope goes to him.  He's like, he's seen the toy store.  I'm like, I don't get it.  I don't fucking get it.  Yeah.  I don't watch cartoons.  You see that one about, no.  I didn't.  None of them.  I love cartoons.  But that's not, of course you do.  That's a point.  You're insane, Mike.  Of course you do.  I mean, vintage cartoons. 
[02:39:00]  I love the family guy.  All that kind of stuff.  Yeah, that's family guy.  And like, I don't count that or South Park or The Simpsons.  Those are like more adult cartoons.  But I mean, I just, the fucking Pixar shit does nothing for me.  What about collecting toys and stuff?  It's like people want to kind of stay 9 or 10.  Yeah.  Well, E-Rock, we know.  And well, our own Sam.  But they're kind of young and immature and probably won't go anywhere in life anyway.  But didn't you want to shake it off?  Like when you were a little kid, didn't you used to think, like, oh, I can't wait till I'm older and I can go to a bar? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  You know?  Like, that was the shit to me.  That was nice to think about.  Yeah.  Get my license.  Go to a bar.  Pretty much in that order.  Drive drunk.  I couldn't wait till I was older and I could buy more stuff.  That's what I always looked at getting older, as buying more things that I wanted to keep.  Really?  Yes.  More baseball cards.  I just look at your own money.  Benchmarks.  Yeah.  And nobody's telling you what you can and can't buy with it.  35 cents a day was my allowance when I was very young.  35 cents a day.  Hell, cheapos.  Did you get it every day?  How did you get that?  When I behaved properly. 
[02:40:00]  Every day?  I would get, like, 35 cents a week.  Me too.  It's terrible.  If I got a dollar, I'm like, yeah!  And then they'd get pissed at you.  And then my parents would get pissed at me for going, like, to the candy store and spending it.  They'd be like, you burn a hole in your pocket.  It's like, what am I supposed to do?  You save it?  So in 50 years, I fucking have, like, three bucks?  What are you giving me?  You still feel like that now, though?  Yeah, sure.  And I'm still burning a hole through my pocket.  Or as my mom used to call it, well, a certain type of rich. 
[02:40:30]  Let's just say.  Temporarily?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, another type of rich.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You got any vices, Mike?  I got a lot of them, I think, pretty much.  I used to drink alive and drank in a long time.  Yeah, you should take it back up.  It's cool.  All the kids are doing it.  I miss it, though.  I wasn't a happy drunk or a good drunk or a nice guy.  You weren't?  No, no.  Were you mean drunk?  I started happy and ended miserable, really.  It's like, I would be happy.  And then, like, you know, want to fight people.  What kind of stuff? 
[02:41:00]  See, I can't imagine that part of, like, I'll get annoyed quicker at someone that's legitimately  being annoying after I've had a few.  Like, it's like, fucking that guy.  I wish he'd shut the fuck up, you know?  But normally, if I'm drinking, I'm kind of a happy guy.  Yeah, you are.  I'm a happy drunk.  You are a good drunk.  You're not.  I've never seen Anthony.  Anthony will repeat himself, but that's...  Oh, many times over, yeah.  But of all the things a drunk can do, that's by far the least offensive. 
[02:41:30]  I mean...  But it is what I am repeating that is horrifically awful racist.  Yeah, sometimes.  A lot of times it's just another...  It's a weird thing we're taught.  Whatever it is, it could be anything, you know?  I do tend to babble on.  But I, you know, I do the same thing.  It's just, you know, when you're drunk, you do it a couple more times, but it's not...  You're not...  You're a very tolerable drunk when you're drunk.  I try to be...  And I don't even try.  It's just the way I've always been.  I've never been a nasty drunk, and I don't like nasty drunks.  I was married to one.  Oh, was that a fucking nightmare.  You're worse sober. 
[02:42:00]  You're meaner sober than you are drunk.  I really am.  You're an awful sober person.  You're fucking right.  You're a great drunk.  I am really meaner sober.  God, I mellow out when I'm drunk.  I got a dumb smile on my face.  My eyes go to half-mask.  All I want to do is karaoke.  It's great.  But, you know, even when I was a little kid, I liked when the adults drank.  Like, that probably was like a sign that I was going to be an alcoholic and addict,  because when I was little and my family would drink, I'd be like, this is the fucking best. 
[02:42:30]  You just felt like the rules got relaxed.  Yeah, like everything.  Like, hey, we're finally having some fun.  They were laughing, too.  Do you remember?  But, like, did you have gatherings of your relatives, and they'd be over having, like,  these parties and get-togethers drinking, and you were kind of just wandering around  as a kid, and you'd hear, like, these belly laughs coming out of your uncles and assing.  People singing and trying to harmonize.  Yeah.  All these people who were such tight asses.  Yes.  And then you...  It looked like a pisser.  Yeah.  And you were just like, this is the fucking best thing. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  You should get a lot of liquor all the time.  Yeah.  Just getting around the piano, fucking singing.  Then all of a sudden, their daughter walks down and tinkles on the run and tells an astronaut  he's going to die up there.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  We had a...  We had...  Our whole family, our whole big Italian family had a bungalow out in Mastic Beach, Long  Island.  Nice.  Oh.  Unbelievable.  And this was Mastic Beach of... 
[02:43:30]  And I'll even give you a year.  How about 1967?  Around there.  67, 68.  Around there.  I was a wee little kid.  But I remember going there, and it was a lily-white community of bungalows with pools.  And I remember the rooms they had were just like these little rooms with cots in them,  with accordion doors.  Like, just nothing going on.  And all the aunts would be cooking inside.  The uncles and my father would be out by the pool just drinking their Schaefer beers. 
[02:44:00]  And at night, they would have these parties that were just insane.  They'd string up lights.  One night would be luau night, and they'd all dress like fucking in Hawaiian shit.  Just having these big, drunken parties.  All of them are smoking.  Like, two at a clip.  And it just looked fun to me.  Yeah, it was the same way.  Like, some people would sit around, and I'm like, oh, I was nervous when it happened.  And I was like, no, this is the fucking best.  Even if my uncle started fighting, I'd be like, finally, everyone's fucking acting real. 
[02:44:30]  This is real.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  And we were like, we would mix drinks for them when we were kids.  Yeah.  I would mix drinks for my grandmother all the time.  And grab beers.  I was always like, you know, dad would be like, hey, get me a beer.  And then I'd be like, if I could have a sip, okay.  And then they'd pop it.  And it's like, you know, six, seven years old.  Take a sip of beer.  Oh, that's good.  Felt fantastic.  Do you still take beer out of cans?  If there's no bottles.  Do I mean, do people still?  And if the cans are empty, yeah. 
[02:45:00]  There's still popular beer, a can of beer?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought it was all bottles now.  No, cans are good for, like, backyard barbecues if you're going to load up a big cooler with ice.  Oh, okay, right, right, right.  So they don't break and you get some drunk going around dropping on your deck or some shit.  I got a text, by the way, an answer.  The lawn jockey is Jocko, who worked for George Washington, holding the lantern to guide troops home.  That sounds like a hero.  He is a hero, really, right?  That's a fucking hero, then.  Why was he in a jockey fucking outfit?  Oh, no, no, he's because they thought it looked hilarious and adorable. 
[02:45:30]  My friend Heidi sent this, and I go, really?  And she goes, yes, I swear, he was Washington's slave who held the lantern.  So maybe because he was an ex-slave.  Yeah, but he's still a hero, really, right?  That's a hero.  Look at him.  He's holding the lantern, bringing George back home.  Are you really a hero if you're being told to hold the lantern?  I don't think that's a hero.  Well, he had the lantern and slippers.  He was really, if I can help him.  Yeah, he was waiting for him to come home.  What would he be doing if he wasn't holding the lantern?  Someone didn't tell him to hold the lantern.  They would have him hold the flag.  Guys ran with the flag in battle, then.  Oh, please. 
[02:46:00]  He'd be waving the lantern so other people could see it in a flash mob.  An early flash mob with Morse code.  Smoke signals.  I didn't mean to stop the show with that information.  I was wondering.  No, no, I didn't know that.  Heidi really helped out there.  Thanks, Heidi.  I didn't know that.  See if she knows anything about the movie Mandingo.  Right back to her.  Mandingo.  You know when a woman watches Mandingo and she has a Freudian, she's like, oh, no, I only  saw the lower half.  Not the first half.  It's a big black cock.  Bad joke. 
[02:46:30]  It was a fucking joke disguised as a boring statement.  Anthony, I have a big Italian family.  It was awesome, too.  I missed the, like I said, we used to, days to drink, all happy and stuff.  It was a good time.  Yeah, I still go to my family's house on Christmas and Thanksgiving and shit like that.  It's just fun.  They're just drinking.  A few of them have stopped.  But the next generation is coming up.  And I realize, like, they're like I was growing up watching me having some, you know, drinks. 
[02:47:00]  And now they're, like, looking at me like I looked at my uncles and shit.  And I'm like, oh, fuck.  Getting old.  Blows.  Well, that's the great thing about kids.  You can see your own death in their eyes.  You can look at them and just see.  You can see.  Now, here's another thing I did with a kid.  When, like, your grandparents or whatever would say, when I was your age and we would  do this, I always thought they were lying.  I never thought for a second that they were ever young.  That they were young. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, they were always old.  I would be like, yeah, what a great lie.  They would tell.  Yeah.  Because they just seemed like they were the most elderly people and always were.  Yeah, always were old.  Even when I remember going over my grandmother's house.  And she had to be in her 40s, I guess, maybe.  And she was old.  Yeah.  Fucking old.  But you don't want to think of them young.  You don't want to think of, like, them doing shit.  Like, you want to think of your grandfather.  That of Coney Island getting banged under the boardwalk.  Right.  Grandma with her legs akimbo. 
[02:48:00]  Do you want to think of her looking at his cock and noticing it's hard and rubbing it  through his pants?  Grandpa with that striped fucking bathing suit on and the handlebar mustache.  Just wailing away at her.  Yeah, she's holding a cotton candy and her face on a bench.  Fucking horse jumping off into a little pool.  Oh, the steel pier, yeah.  You're as hard as the steel pier today.  Oh, God.  Oh, right.  That's the only references.  It's all from Coney Island.  Anthony, Jim played a trick of me one time.  I mean, he's notorious for breaking balls and stuff. 
[02:48:30]  I don't remember this.  A wedding.  Remember Francesca's wedding?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw a picture of that recently, all of us.  Were you Levy Florentine?  Jim said to me, you know, watch my plate.  I figure he's going to go to the bathroom.  You know what I'm saying, right?  So I'm hanging there a bit.  Five minutes goes by.  Where's no...  He's probably...  Jim was like, he'll be back.  Don't worry, buddy.  I'm holding the plate for like 45 minutes.  Oh, you scumbag.  And then he's like, you're still holding that thing for me, buddy?  What's the matter with you?  Oh, yeah.  I'm just handing this stuff.  I'll be right back.  Taking advantage of his... 
[02:49:00]  Good times.  Good times.  Those were the days.  Taking advantage of his good nature.  In the bathroom, Anthony, in the comic strip.  That's great.  Florentine Bill.  Hey, buddy, come on in a minute.  I'm going to tell you something.  I went in and I fucking heard...  The door slammed like it was a...  You locked him in the bathroom?  No.  Nice, Jim.  The other gym.  Oh, oh.  Okay.  Florentine?  Yeah, yeah.  They're like breaking balls from me.  They're like...  They'd whistle at women and then...  They'd whistle at women going down the street, Anthony, with big guys like this. 
[02:49:30]  And then they would whistle and then they would look back at me like I did it.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, you know.  Good natured.  Yeah, good times.  You know.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  You know what I mean.  We have friends.  We have a younger innocence.  It was fun.  I don't care if you're friends.  You know, back then you pulled gags.  Now you get a lawsuit on death to do anything like that.  We used to tie my friend's shoelaces together when he fell asleep at parties and shut all  the lights out and then go to another friend's house and call, knowing that he would get 
[02:50:00]  up in the dark, try and find a fall on his fucking face.  That's fucking hilarious.  Good times.  Great times.  I don't even know.  More fun back then.  Happy days.  Happy days.  Good times.  You know, it was a more innocent time back then, Jimmy.  It was the 90s.  More innocent time.  And, you know, speaking of innocence, one way to lose your innocence is to get engaged.  Right?  That's true.  I know I lost my innocence when I got engaged. 
[02:50:30]  I always thought I was being looked at as a kid, more immature than I was.  You know, I was getting older in years, but I was still being looked at as, you know,  right, it's Rosie's kid.  I go into the bar that she worked at and it's like, hey, Rosie, get your kid a drink.  Right.  And I'm like, it was so odd for you to be in that place on MASH too.  You know, Clinger's in there trying to have a beer.  Yeah, Radar's hiding his hand.  Hiding that deformed hand he had. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I'd like to see Steven Singer find a ring for that.  With a clipboard over his hand.  Yes.  Chopper's coming.  Oh, damn.  Look at that.  And anyway, look, if you're going to get married, right?  And Sam knows this.  Yeah, well, I'm getting married.  Where do you go?  For an engagement ring?  For a diamond ring?  Yeah.  The only place to go is Steven Singer Jewelers.  Ah, thank God you said that, because that's what I'm talking about, Steven Singer Jewelers. 
[02:51:30]  What are you looking for?  Any size, shape, loose, certified diamond?  I like my diamonds loose like my women.  Ah, I get it.  Right?  Do I have any 12-year-old diamonds?  Oh, God.  Here, hold this plate.  I'll be right back.  Oh, God.  Steven Singer Jewelers.  It's a risk-free shopping, is what they say.  You go in there, you're not going to get stabbed.  It's risk-free.  Is that what he means?  That's right.  Risk-free.  No violence.  No violence. 
[02:52:00]  They mop the floor nice so you don't slip.  They won't even make fun of you.  There's no risk of having your feelings.  Right.  With the absolute best guarantee and warranty in the business.  90 days.  No questions asked.  You come back in.  You put the ring on the counter.  And then you just look at him like, I don't want this.  Don't say a word.  Right.  It says no questions asked.  You don't even say a word.  You look at him like, fuck you, pay me.  Yeah, fuck you, pay me.  I like that.  Fuck you, pay me.  And he will.  You're not going to find that anywhere else.  Steven Singer even pays for shipping both ways. 
[02:52:30]  Both ways.  You never have a piece of jewelry from Steven Singer that you're not going to absolutely love.  Sam, E-Rock, oh, they headed over to Steven Singer when they needed to show their loved one that they loved them in a lovingly love way.  And they loved it.  And they loved it.  Of course they did.  Go to Steven Singer Jewelers.  It's risk-free.  And that's 365 days a year.  Free parking.  Oh, free shipping 365 days a year.  He's not there 365 days a year.  No, he takes Christmas off.  Go see Steven Singer in person. 
[02:53:00]  He's at the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  And if you're under 18, do it before 9 o'clock.  That's the curfew in Philly because of the wilding they're doing there, those kids.  They're crazy.  Not at Steven Singer's, though.  No, no, no.  They can't get in there?  Oh, I bet.  What has he got, the double doors with the buzzer?  He showed me the whole thing.  Does he have the double buzzer?  That place will seal up within five seconds.  You'll never get out of there in time.  I bet.  I won't say it on the air.

[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Has he fled the area of the Outer Banks?  There's a Twitter picture he put up of...  The dead horse in the water?  No.  The resort area that he's in?  Yeah.  There's a dead horse in his beach water?  Yeah.  It's got a horse that no name is something, you know.  Oh, Chip.  What?  But there is a pretty cool picture he twittered of the fucking fog on the sand dunes and shit. 
[02:56:30]  But it's going to be cool until he's standing there with fucking 180 mile an hour winds blowing the house off the fucking foundation.  Yeah.  Shouldn't he have evacuated?  I think so.  Well, last time he was bummed out that he did evacuate.  And he said if it ever happened again, he wanted to stay the course.  It's cool.  Of course, he probably didn't think it would happen again one year later.  What's he going to do with his baby?  I mean, you've got to watch the kid and the wife.  That's another thing.  Once you have a kid, you can't...  Tie him off.  You've got to tie him off.  You've got time to get...  Is that it?  So then they don't blow away.  Once you have a kid, though, that kind of puts that shit... 
[02:57:00]  It's cool to be like, ah, there's a hurricane coming.  You know, I'm going to fucking hang out and do that.  Once you have a kid, you kind of can't do that shit anymore.  All the fun stops, yeah.  Yeah, all the fun stops, right?  Yeah, you play safety first.  Don't have the baby in a hurricane.  You might want to take the baby to safety.  Unless they know that that house is safe.  I don't know.  Maybe it's a hotel.  There's nothing safe.  If the hurricane hits you dead on, it's like a bomb.  There's nothing safe.  Nothing.  Nowhere is safe.  You don't know what you're going to get, though. 
[02:57:30]  You never know exactly what it's like.  Did you read the three little pigs?  The straw house?  Yeah, I did.  And even the bricks.  But at least there was a warning, though.  I mean, it's like the hurricane won't knock and then threaten, then you have to leave.  I saw the movie, which is supposedly a lot different.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's the same story.  I mean, it all comes back together for it.  Yeah, all comes together at the end.  So when are they going to be forced out of Long Beach or wherever he is?  He's riding that horse right now.  See, he's sitting on the dead one yelling, giddy up. 
[02:58:00]  Giddy up.  I think I had that horse in Belmont last week.  I want to tell you that, folks.  Yeah, I had that one, too.  Shut up.  I'm on sniper mode right now.  The Woodsman was a documentary about Kevin Bacon.  No one knew.  It was just a reality show.  They called him Kevin in the whole movie.  Reality show.  They didn't realize.  That really was a fucking gem of a movie.  Oh, it certainly was.  What a creep.  A rod maker.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:58:30]  Exactly.  They should have called that Nosy Neighbors.  Fucking Mind Your Beeswax starring Kevin Bacon.  Well, I'm looking at the map now, and it is looking pretty dire.  Yeah.  Category 3, making its way up to Cape Hatteras.  And then moving in by, I guess, Delaware.  Is that Delaware over there?  Delahoo, Delahoo, Delaware.  They're calling it right now.  That's exactly what it is.  Delahoo.  And then by the time it hits us, it should be, what, a 1?  So Cape Hatteras is about where Ope is, right? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is 110 miles an hour bad, though?  I mean, that's fast, but that's not really hard.  It's not the worst, but it's pretty bad.  It's unpleasant.  That's a pretty bad hurricane, because that's sustained winds.  Where's Greg Ope Hughes?  It can gust up to probably 150.  Right off our tent.  It's below a right nipple and a fucking...  I like how we just forecast what happens in the U.S.  Once it goes into Canada, we could give a flying fuck.  Yeah, that's the end of it.  So then it dissipates into nothingness.  That's it.  Who cares?  It's gone. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't get...  Don't wonder whether it's working out.  I don't think that people generally know where these things are going.  There's no way to figure it out.  A storm right now, a thousand miles away, you don't know where it's going to fucking go.  See, look at the tracks.  Look.  See, there's one that goes, whips way the fuck off to the right, and that's to cover their own ass.  So they could go, look, we had a line that went out that way, don't worry about it. 
[03:00:00]  Why don't we take Vegas odds and we lay it down, you pick a line.  We should.  And you bet on this thing and make it a little excitement.  Pick a line.  Remember those days?  Then whatever happens, somebody's a winner.  Somebody's a lucky fucking winner.  Yeah.  Would you fuck her, Mike?  Absolutely.  How about him on the other channel, CNN?  She looks like she's a fucking wild skank.  Oh, wow.  A wild skank.  Who doesn't love a wild skank every so often, right? 
[03:00:30]  That's right.  You like crazy broads, right, Ronnie?  Well, who doesn't?  You know my reputation, right?  Yeah, sure.  I've probably had more crazy broads than a lot of people you probably know, and you've  seen them.  Right.  There's something about the crazy broad, right?  The insanity.  Yeah.  What is it?  I'll tell you what it is.  Because it's a hassle, though.  It's not an easy fucking thing to deal with.  The things that make them a great fuck make them horrible people.  Terrible childhood, fucking lack of inhibitions, lack of boundaries, all those things that make 
[03:01:00]  somebody enraging to be around make them great fucks, because their inhibitions are gone.  But then also the thing to know that someone likes you enough to cut herself over is just,  you know, like, oh, you know what?  She threw herself in front of the car.  I guess she does care.  You know, any of that stuff.  She's so mad at you that she just starts to cut her own hair.  You're like, yeah, she does like me.  The ones that'll just wind the hair around the finger and pull it out. 
[03:01:30]  I never had that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And rocking back and forth.  A couple of those.  So they do it and just telling you how awful you are.  The fucking ones that are just looking for any kind of drug in your medicine cabinet.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The cutter.  I've dealt with the cutter issue.  That was a fun one.  Well, the ones that just hug you, like, for too long.  Like, when it's time for a hug and you know that they just don't want to let go.  Yeah.  God, this is just not about me.  Because you're just leaving.  Yeah.  Because you really are leaving.  This is about 20 years ago. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Or 15 years ago.  And also, they honestly can't believe that you're not going to do something awful.  Like, they'll just say over and over.  Yeah, yeah.  If you're kind of a nice guy, I guess.  But I'm not really a nice.  I'm nice enough.  I don't punch girls.  That's good.  But I am kind of selfish with my time.  From a psychological point of view, you're abusive.  Am I?  I'm wondering.  Here's how I see me.  I'm fiscally generous, yet morally selfish, and just like I'm selfish with my emotions and my time. 
[03:02:30]  Well, you're emotionally vapid, I believe.  Yes.  There's no emotions there.  Do you think Anthony uses his fiscal generosity as a way to almost say, like, you're getting this, so don't ask for that?  Like, almost a way of setting it up.  Like, that's almost a moat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Between you and them.  Here's the thing.  I think if you wrap a bankroll around your dick and fucking tie it off with a rubber band, it's showing that you're compensating for something else. 
[03:03:00]  Right.  But do you feel like you even have the same connections, other human beings, that you did when you were younger?  No.  Like, I think emotions, they might be finite.  Like, you only get so many.  Yeah, yeah.  I definitely don't feel the same that I did even up until, let me see, maybe even like the mid to late 90s.  I was a pretty feeling guy up until then.  And then I just got to the point, like, girls to me especially, like, being in a relationship and having a girlfriend, to me that was such a, like, I put that whole relationship thing way up there. 
[03:03:30]  Right.  Way up there.  And even things like sex and stuff, I kept it pretty high, high up in that pedestal.  You know what I mean?  Like, as far as relationships go and things like that.  And then, I don't know, it just kind of, not that I don't have any caring at all or anything like that, but it's not as important and as infuriating when certain things happen in a relationship. 
[03:04:00]  Sure.  As it used to be where I would be devastated by certain things.  Now I just kind of take it like, oh, well, that's how it goes.  But it's even, like, that would be, almost the way you're saying it, it would be emotionally better than what's really happening, is that you know that she's crying and screaming, but the voice seems further away than it used to be.  It's a little further away.  It's like, eh, until you, like, not hear it anymore at some point.  I was always getting ragged on by, I think, every girlfriend I had about the fact that I just don't, I don't listen because I would, I would ask something and it was like, I already told you that. 
[03:04:30]  And I'm like, ah, God, I fucking tripped myself up again because I wasn't listening.  What's worse than that?  But not even not listening.  When they think information is important, that genuinely isn't.  Like, I was with a girlfriend one time and I was going to meet her.  That genuinely isn't.  But it's not.  Maybe to them it is.  That's all I can say.  I could pull out a fucking, a little murderous Donald Sutherland reference from 1973. 
[03:05:00]  You don't give a fuck about that.  So why should I care what you told me to meet you, you cunt?  That is really strange.  I was going to pick a girl up one time and it was on the corner by Central Park and Trump, you know, the Trump building is right by Central Park.  And she said by the Trump building.  But I stopped on the Central Park side thinking she was there.  She goes, no, but I told you the Trump building.  And just that like, but I told you, it was like, do you fucking think?  I told you.  I've been up since five o'clock in the morning. 
[03:05:30]  You think I got nothing else to do but figure out where you're going to be standing when I'm technically right anyway?  Just shut the fuck up.  And that put me in a horrible mood for the rest of the night.  That type of, that fucking needling shit that women do.  You don't understand how much we hate you for that.  It's infuriating.  Stop fucking needling everybody.  It's infuriating when you're told you're not, you're not listening.  You're not paying attention.  You're not doing, when, when I, I am, but I'm, I could filter a few things out.  Yeah.  And there's sometimes.  Details.  Details.  I don't need so many of them. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  And don't tell me shit.  Now, you know, this might be some hack fucking standup thing, but don't tell me shit when I'm doing something that's important to me.  Like, like that, that to me is just as bad as me forgetting what they said.  The reason I forgot it, it, you see me concentrating on something and, and then you tell me something and I give you a half-assed yeah.  And then I'll forget.  Right.  I'm watching an Aussie video where she comes in and tells me, my mother's birthday is Tuesday. 
[03:06:30]  Who gives a fuck?  Even if it's Monday.  But B, why would I care watching this video about that fucking, the day that with her dumb vagina knocking you out?  It's bad timing.  It is.  It's bad timing.  Mike, you always have a way of crystallizing.  It sums it up.  It sums it up.  It's like, you know, women are like, like, it's like a dog with a bone.  They fucking can't let it go and they start bit ragging with you.  I hate it.  It's like, you know what I mean?  Like you said, we're listening to a woman.  Just pay attention to your first couple of words and just give them a nod here and there.  And like, you know, that's what I do. 
[03:07:00]  Nod your way through it?  Yeah.  Like, oh yeah.  Awesome.  You know what I mean?  Just make sure you pay attention to keywords.  Keywords.  Like fucking, you know, cheating.  Valtrex.  What do you think of that girl on the TV, Mike?  Is she not a fucking knockout or what?  She is.  How old is she about?  I don't know.  That's the Filipino boy on the screen above you.  He's nine, Mike.  No, but I have a celebrity crush, though.  I love Christina Ricci.  She's one of my favorites.  Really?  Jesus.  Mine, too, in 1995.  What are you doing?  Well, Buffalo 66 came out, right? 
[03:07:30]  What the hell?  She's filling out that restraining order right now.  Do you like her in the Addams Family?  Is that what you like?  No, no.  My dad's wrong.  No, I didn't like her until like about 2000, like the early 2000s when she was legitimately  18 years old, I think.  Do you ever jerk off to her?  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.  I mean...  Send her a letter?  No, I don't know how to get in contact with her.  I say you pick up an axe and just start looking.  She's hot, though.  She's hot.  I love her.  She's great now.  Is she hot?  Yeah, I think so. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, she is.  She's hotter now than she was when she was when she was at Addams.  What's your favorite picture of her to jack off to?  I have a good imagination reel.  I don't even look at her.  What's your fantasy with Christina Ricci?  What do you imagine?  What was that one she was in with Samuel Jackson there?  Oh, she had like a big snake around there.  Oh, she was sexy in that.  All right.  Black Snake Mode.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Where the fucking black guy wouldn't fuck the white guy.  It was really a very believable film.  Very realistic.  Yeah, yeah.  So, what exactly, what's your fantasy with Christina Ricci?  Just to have a, you know, just come over and have a nice dinner and do her all night. 
[03:08:30]  God, come on.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  That's really sexy.  God, I could jerk off to hearing that, Mike.  That's really sexy.  Oh, boy.  Nice dinner.  Nice dinner.  Everybody's a nice dinner.  They're a jerk-off fantasy.  Yeah, exactly.  What exactly is that?  Maybe some egg rolls.  Yeah, you take her to Hong Kong Gardens and then rape her in the parking lot?  Hong Kong Gardens.  What?  That's the worst fantasy I've ever heard. 
[03:09:00]  Have a nice dinner and do her all night.  Do her all night.  How about a little more details?  What kind of dinner?  Is the delivery late?  Is that a big mix on fucking Broadway?  It would probably be something simple, you know, like, I don't know.  Maybe, I like romance to a woman.  I really do.  Nice candlelight thing.  Pull the mic closer to you.  So, come on.  When you jack it off, you fucking, you grab your dick.  Like, what exactly happens with this girl?  My dick usually goes bananas the minute I start thinking about it.  It's like Mount Vesuvius when it goes.  How long do you take to fucking blow a load? 
[03:09:30]  It depends on what kind of mood it's in.  It's early in the morning, you know.  It's like, it depends what kind of day I had early in the day.  Well, so when you're thinking of Christina Ricci, do you picture the dinner or do you just  picture that you know the dinner?  I just picture those tits, me fucking banging her, really.  That's about it.  The dinner would be really awkward as you're just staring at her tits.  I'm going to say save the dinner for after.  Maybe you're hungry.  Yeah, that's true.  Get right to the fucking.  I started me dinner naked.  You thought that?  Oh, jeez.  You have very basic fantasies.  I guess you're not a, I don't know. 
[03:10:00]  My fantasies are more in depth.  I do.  I like, like, I love a woman dressed as a Marine drill instructor yelling at me and I  fucked her after that.  That's a little more detailed.  That's a little more detailed.  What do you call her?  Sergeant Carter the whole fucking time?  I know, she'll be like, she'll be like Ollie Ermey from Full Metal Jacket screaming at me,  you nitwit, fuck me, you scat, you know.  You kill yourself on the toilet at the end, Mike?  No, no, no, no.  That's fucking terrible.  Why is Private Bichetti coming in his underpants? 
[03:10:30]  All right.  She put some fucking soap bars into a pillowcase.  States to beat you with them.  Solid dream.  Solid dream.  I actually did join the Marines when I was young.  I was there for the first phase of training, really.  Really?  Paris Island, 1980.  What happened?  They wanted me to leave and I kind of wanted to leave as well.  Why did they want you to leave?  They asked you to leave?  It was a mutual agreement that we both, you know, agreed on. 
[03:11:00]  What would they say?  They said, he said, you know, you're not really right for this.  He gave me, and then I talked to him about all that kind of stuff, you know.  So, wait, they said you weren't right for it.  What happened when they said you weren't right for it?  I just wasn't doing well, but I thought it was going to be awesome.  I loved it.  The first day I got there, they started with me.  The minute I got off that bus, it was pure hell.  Was that a surprise to you?  I think everybody knows that one from, did you watch Stripes?  No.  I was a little before Stripes.  Oh. 
[03:11:30]  I had no guidelines.  You watched every movie from World War II forward?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's pretty much what happened.  I would be like Bridge on the River Kwai, you know what I mean?  That's what I thought it was going to be.  What were they saying to you?  Japanese prisoner building a bridge?  The minute I got off the bus, right, you were supposed to run up to these yellow footprints  and say, sir, yes, sir, right?  And by mistake, I said, yes, sir.  So, he turned around and went, who's your dick sucker that got a cocked on his throat  and said, sir, instead of yes, sir, he goes, look at you, Liberace.  He pointed at me and I go, sir, yes, sir.  I was so nervous in his life.  Oh, Liberace. 
[03:12:00]  They just started with me the minute I got there.  But this is weird, Mike, that this is still your jerk-off fantasy 31 years later.  That's still there for you.  There's something about it that you've done.  I love it.  It's like, I love Full Metal Jacket.  I can watch that movie like nine times in a row.  It's an awesome film.  Do you like being spanked?  No, no, no, no, no.  None of that stuff?  None of that stuff, no.  No, finger in the ass.  Yeah, just straight sex and suck some tits and eat her and then fuck her and that's it.  And that's it. 
[03:12:30]  And that's it.  That's the end of it.  End of story.  Done.  When's the last time you got blown?  Oh, God.  Let's just say the 20th century is pretty worked out well.  Who was president?  Clinton?  No, it was in between administrations, I think.  Well, that's a very straight administration.  That's a very quick turnaround, Mike.  A lame duck blown job?  Fascinating.  So what happened?  Where was the last blowjob?  Was it a hooker or a regular girl? 
[03:13:00]  It was a hooker.  When it comes to a regular woman, they always give me the friend category, all that horse shit.  You're such a...  Fuck that friend card.  You don't like it.  Unless you hang around long enough and you're vulnerable.  Like, he's my buddy.  I use the friend card sometimes.  It works.  Oh, yeah?  Once in a while.  I've never had that really work out.  It depends, you know.  Have you fucked any female friends?  I've made out with some female friends, but I had this girl from years ago, my friend.  I was really a douchebag woman in my early 20s. 
[03:13:30]  No, no.  Pretty much.  Don't get down on yourself.  I was actually banging my best friend of mine's sister for, like, on and off for, like, 10 years.  We had a trist or trist, whatever the hell you call it.  A rape?  No, no, no.  She was actually...  I've seen her recently.  We went on a date a few years ago, and I'm like, it wasn't the same, because she called  me up, I'd do it, whatever, you know, and that was it.  And then she called me up to go to a movie, and I'm like, what the fuck am I seeing in a movie for with this whore? 
[03:14:00]  I used to get this for free.  What the hell am I fucking a moron, man?  No, at least you handled it as a gentleman would.  No, no, but I'm like...  I used to see those tics, and now she's like, I got to fucking hold her hand in a movie.  Get the fuck out of here.  No, no.  Hey, gosh.  Now, does your best friend get upset about that, or is he okay?  No, my friend was like a Luca Bracci type, a big Italian guy that was like, this is  a bad temper.  Oh.  Fucking put a knife in his hand at the concession counter?  Oh, no, no, he never got hired at the concession counter, that's for sure. 
[03:14:30]  So, literal Mike.  So, when the girl would come over and fuck you, would she suck your dick first?  Would you kiss her?  What happened?  I've never seen you later.  I wouldn't make it out, and I'd fill her up, and I'd eat her.  She loved to be eaten, though.  That was fucking awesome.  Would you lay her on her back or her stomach?  I'd just get on my knees and start eating that fucking box.  Start eating that box.  On your knees while she was standing?  Yeah, she was standing like, yeah, this is fucking, but it was young pussy.  She was 18 years old, and like, it doesn't smell like piss now, you know what I mean? 
[03:15:00]  That's true.  So true.  Right.  That's a good point, Mike.  So, you'd kneel and just eat her pussy?  Would you talk to her?  Very little.  She'd moan a lot.  I'd be like, come, she'd moan.  I love when she'd moan, you know, it was just fucking awesome.  That skank was moaning her ass off.  Sexy guy.  Yeah.  Mike knows.  My respect for women.  There is nothing funnier than the term eating.  I do.  That's the greatest thing.  Eat her. 
[03:15:30]  Eat her out.  I haven't heard that since fucking, like, junior high.  Did you eat her out?  Yeah, but it's not even me.  Do they still say make-out sessions?  I don't know.  Make-out session?  I feel like an episode of Happy Days make-out session.  Well, Vodio Dodo, let me tell you.  Correctamundo.  I don't know.  I thought it was Go Down On would be a better.  Yeah.  Eat Out is...  You don't say eat out the skank's box anymore?  You're all done with that? 
[03:16:00]  I think they finished that one.  That's old school.  I know.  You're OG.  I still am.  I love it, though.  But I love young women, though, like early 30s.  How old are you?  I'm 50.  Are you 50?  Yeah.  Wow.  Fuck.  Just turned it in April.  Oh, all right.  So you like younger pussy in the 30s.  Early 30s.  Early 30s.  You eat the ass?  Yeah, if it's available, sure.  I hope it would be.  Wouldn't it be?  She had a bandage on it and says I'm being treated for cancer?  Back there? 
[03:16:30]  Dating Chrissy from Jaws.  She doesn't have an ass.  Or Farrah.  Oh, right.  So if it's available, what would make it unavailable?  If it's fucking skanky, you know what I mean?  I'll look at it first.  If it looks like it's got fucking all shit on it, oh, God.  Wow.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, you don't want to shit on it.  No, no.  I'm staying away from that.  What are you getting girls, Bangladesh?  Do you sniff your fingers after fingering?  No.  You like to finger a check?  You know what?  Young women smell great. 
[03:17:00]  I don't want anybody my own age.  What the fuck?  I want a 65-year-old woman who would fuck her kids in a station wagon.  Cotton candy and homework, they smell like.  It's fantastic.  Well, like, even the mid-20s is cool, but that's kind of young for me still.  What?  25, 26.  That's crazy.  Do you like them to ride you or do you like to get behind her?  I'm in charge of the game, Jim.  Oh.  Whether she likes it or not.  Have you ever taken a girl into a barn and just petted her hair a little bit and fucking 
[03:17:30]  killed Curly's wife?  Oh, Curly's wife.  That's a...  Fuck, I forgot the name of it.  A Mice and Men.  Yeah, yeah.  When he killed a...  Oh, fuck.  Sorry.  It's been a while.  It's a John Steinbeck reference.  I probably shouldn't have pulled it out.  Like, the movie just came out in fucking 3D.  Fucking Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney were in it.  Talking about it like it just...  Did you guys see that movie 71 years ago?  I love Burgess Meredith.  He was awesome.  He was great.  Good penguin.  Many things. 
[03:18:00]  I was just looking up at the old television and I guess they postponed indefinitely the  Martin Luther King statue unveiling, what do you want to call it?  Why?  Commemoration.  It's going to rain.  Because of the hurricane.  But there was a picture taken at a certain angle of that statue.  Have you seen that one?  No, I haven't seen it.  With the Dr. Reverend Martin Luther King from the side, the statue.  And behind him is the Washington Monument.  And it's in a certain way where, I swear to you, it looks just like a Klansman in a 
[03:18:30]  Klan hood, the top of the tower, looking down on Martin Luther King.  And it's available on the internet.  All you'd have to do is punch in, I'm sure, MLK statue, Washington Monument, KKK, something  like that.  But it really does...  They don't have the time to look into a fucking mistake like this.  They don't look...  What could possibly go wrong while we're making this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, and placing it and putting it there. 
[03:19:00]  And where they placed it is a certain angle that just looks a little weird like that.  It is a giant statue, though.  But there are a couple of things that people are pissed at.  It's made in China.  Yeah.  Some people are angry about that.  They want it to be an American.  Made in China.  And Martin Luther King's family actually charged $800,000 to the foundation that had this  thing commissioned for the rights to his likeness and his writings.  Because around the statue were stones with his writings etched into the stones. 
[03:19:30]  And they charged $800,000 for that.  When you would think just the honor of being...  Well, here's the thing, though.  Yes.  No money has come into that family since 68.  He was the only one working.  Yeah, he was the breadwinner.  68 was the last time they had money come in.  So you're thinking maybe it's their due.  Yeah, they just...  Their due or something.  There's a lot of them.  A lot of kings.  Well, they should have lent his name out to anything.  A little bit of like car dealerships.  But they don't get any... 
[03:20:00]  None of the boulevards.  Do they get fucking paid for anything?  They should get a little money for a boulevard naming.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  Surely that's a little boulevard.  That makes me rich.  Well, you know, no matter what town you're in, if you're looking to crack, you always go.  Do you know where MLK is?  MLK.  Yeah.  MLK.  The corner of MLK and then Malcolm X.  I'm trying to see that.  I mean, I'm looking at some photos of MLK's statue and I don't see it.  You haven't seen it?  You probably have to put an MLK statue, Washington Monument.  Like that. 
[03:20:30]  There it is.  See?  That's one of them.  It's a little too high up.  But it's like a Klansman hood.  So there's two little...  Maybe I see a little more abstract than other people when I'm looking at horribly racist  things.  They kept the rest of the stone there?  He's just coming out of the stone?  He's leaning against the wall?  Yes.  He's actually...  Boba Fett is waiting to pick him up and take him to Jabba.  The statue stinks.  It's in carbonite.  He is.  He's trapped in there.  He owes a job of some cash. 
[03:21:00]  What's he doing coming out of the...  Why do they have him standing by himself?  It's like they didn't finish.  It's like they didn't finish the statue.  But he's laying on his back like he's napping.  Fucking put a TV in front of him and a pillow.  That's terrible.  I could only think...  And I haven't read this.  I could only think it looks like he is coming out of the oppression of a block.  It's like...  I see.  It's like, look, this big stone.  That's how casual he is.  His arms are folding.  He's still walking out of that rock.  That's a bunch of malarkey. 
[03:21:30]  You think so?  You think the Chinese didn't finish?  They got lazy.  You'll pay a bill.  He come out the wall.  No, we don't want that.  That's the way you ordered.  That looks ridiculous.  That sucks.  Looks like a...  He's a fucking sphinx.  I'm a sphinx.  It would have been better off to have a picture of him actually getting shot.  It would have been the exact same fucking thing.  This is terrible.  That's a terrible...  Unless that's...  Unless that's not completed...  No, it's finished.  That's it.  Why is that shit? 
[03:22:00]  There's writings on the side and everything.  That's horrendous.  You don't like that he's encased in rock?  Like he's a mummy.  It's the jinx.  It's the mummy.  The jinx.  Oh, God.  It looks like a bad mistake with Play-Doh.  Yeah.  That's true, Mike.  It does.  It's like...  You played it what went wrong.  Yeah.  You could always...  You know, you could always roll him back up in a ball and pick up a Don D comic with him.  Fuck.  I just think it's fucking... 
[03:22:30]  It looks like they didn't care enough to finish.  To finish it.  The back of that is disgustingly fucking...  I don't care what they...  That's terrible.  And I think it ran $250 million.  For what?  Why would they have made a fucking great movie?  I know.  It's crazy.  Why would they have made that here?  Do you know how many people are out of work in fucking D.C.?  Would love to come over to work at seven.  It's infuriating that they sent the work out to China.  A quarter of a billion dollars to China.  To China.  Whose idea was that? 
[03:23:00]  Quickly.  Somebody.  I have no idea.  I guess the Martin Luther King Jr. Foundation for the statue of Martin Luther King Jr.  You know, now the family doesn't look.  They only got $800,000.  They collected money.  At least some Americans made a little bit of money.  Yeah.  I believe they collected some money.  Some is taxpayer money.  They collected money and then the King family got $800,000 out of it.  Just to use his likeness.  Wow.  Which, you know, like I said, obviously they haven't had a lot of money. 
[03:23:30]  No, there's no one else to work in.  They need somebody to market him a little better.  Yeah.  Because, you know, people use Lincoln and Washington on those President's Day car sales.  You see some shyster car salesmen with the little Lincoln beard and the stovepipe hat.  Just get a Martin Luther King guy out there to, you know, I have a dream.  I have a dream of low prices on Nissans.  You know?  It's something.  I had such a terrible Martin Luther King joke when I started. 
[03:24:00]  Did you?  I was really bad when I started.  Did it have something to do with how he babysits his kids?  Babysits his kids?  Nothing.  It's an awful joke.  Believe it or not.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Have anything to do with filling potholes?  No?  No.  Turing roofs?  No, it wasn't racist.  It was just a really bad joke.  Yeah?  Please?  Please?  But keep in mind, it's probably 92 or earlier. 
[03:24:30]  My first two years.  It was a different time.  It was a different world then.  This is cool.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, but it's not a racist joke.  It's not a joke that I would get in trouble for.  It's just a bad joke.  I mean, believe me, I was still eating skanks boxes back then.  Oh, yeah.  Eating them out.  Eating them out.  Eating them out.  Sucking them out.  Getting some tit.  Mike's never taken a bride.  Never.  Never has a woman, never has he settled down with one. 
[03:25:00]  You got to settle down.  It's hard for finding a right one.  I'm very picky, though.  You're picky?  Yeah.  Why don't you take the tape off their mouth and just let them breathe a little bit.  Talk.  What are you looking for in a woman?  Someone that's really nice, that I get along well, that I won't fight with too much.  I'm an easy-going guy when it comes to that.  Good luck with that, huh?  Basically a non-cunt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Jimmy, are we going to hear the joke?  Are we going to get the joke?  I don't remember what the set-up was. 
[03:25:30]  MLK joke.  It was something about I was in my impression of him doing something, and I said, I have  a dream.  And I woke up, and my sheets were sticky.  Oh, Jesus.  You're still a genius.  I love you.  The King wet dream joke.  A wet dream joke.  God, that's fantastic.  I just don't remember what the set-up was.  It's so long ago.  I blocked that one out.  That's a great punch, London.  I loved it.  I don't even think you need a set-up.  I just think you come out and do that fucking bit. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, say that, and then relax, take a bow, and drink some water while the applause watches  over me.  So, anyway, folks.  Yeah, folks.  Get out of here.  I'll let you finish.  Oh, look at the time.  What is this town called again?  Harrisburg?  Wow.  Come on.  Yeah, it's vacation time, as they say.  What's going on?  Looks like the other show's getting on.  I saw that, yeah.  Boy, they leave earlier than we do.  Yeah, they don't.  They get in earlier than we do. 
[03:26:30]  Well, you know how it is.  There you are.  Well, it's about time to slide down that dinosaur, huh?  That's it.  Yeah.  Pick up some ribs and take them home.  Take up the cat.  Go bam-bam into something, right?  No, you have no idea.  So, Mike, where are you going to be appearing at?  Yeah, where are you going to be, anywhere?  I'm still working on my show, Dropping Science.  I have nothing coming up.  It's on a funnier guy.  Dropping Science.  You can see me on Facebook.  All right. 
[03:27:00]  How long does he last?  How long does he last?  I'm dry as a bone.  Oh, really?  Nothing?  You still doing stand-up?  I try to get on as much as I can, but it's been ridiculous in the city.  It's like, I was trying to get a spot in the club.  I was going to tell some people I was on the show today.  They were like, oh, we're booked up.  Wow.  All right.  Ball break.  That's all right.  I'll have my day.  Yeah.  It'll happen.  It'll be good.  I love doing what I do.  There's Opie's Beach on CNN right now.  There's the Outer Banks.  Where's the dead horse? 
[03:27:30]  Apparently, a young man killed a dead horse the other day.  See a wow sticker blowing behind him.  A fucking bunch of plates with hamburgers on them.  A video camera.  Well, everybody, enjoy the storm.  Batten down the hatches.  Be safe, everyone.  Just be safe.  That's the most important thing.  The most important thing.  That's the second one.

[03:28:00]  On fucking Saturday night.  And that you stick it around for Ron and Fez.  Yes.  Just go away for an hour.  Come back.  Why would you tell them to go away for an hour?  Because it's the shit show.  What do you got planned, Sammy?  Got anything?  Not yet.  We got a whole commercial break to go for me to plan.  That's generally when I do a lot of the prep.  Sure is.

They're going to have to let out some luggage, I think, to get over the top of that with Iraq  and the plane.  Come on.  Wait.  Why not one joke before vacation, right?  Yeah, bonus time.  Good.  Thank you, guys, for having me.  It was so much fun.  No problem.  It was a pleasure having you in.  The stories you extoll upon us, fascinating.  I love the eating box.

[03:34:00]  after ONA Live is next  on The Virus,  Sirius XM.  XM.  As Hurricane Irene approaches,  Sirius XM and The Weather Channel  want to help keep you safe  with special coverage.  Turn to Sirius 184  and XM Channel 1  for The Weather Channel.  You'll get breaking news  on The Virus,  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now,  the O.P. and Anthony show  continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host,  Sam Roberts. 
[03:34:30]  We're still here.  After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Ron Bannington is pulling  double duty.  He's still in the house.  Well, um,  I just wanted to say  this real quickly.  This is the fourth radio show  I've been on  within 24 hours.  The fourth?  Yeah, I also did  the whatever show.  Of course.  With Jennifer.  How did that show go?  I've had a couple requests.  Kilt.  Yeah?  Did you do well?  I've had a couple requests  on Twitter,  people saying that  Jennifer should be  on the after show, too. 
[03:35:00]  Because she's all over  the place now,  because I hear her  on Ron and Fez  all the time.  She's, um,  she's trying to make  things happen,  get people to know  who she is.  She's doing that  through nipple slips  and stuff, though, right?  That I don't comment on,  because I don't think  she needs to work below.  I know, I heard you say that.  Lily's with her now.  You're a friend.  Yeah, I saw her.  She walked by my office  the other day  and showed off  her ID card  as if to say  they let me in here.  You two were together  for a while, right?  No, we were friends,  but we were never together.  I thought she was with you.  You know who you're thinking  of is Than.  I never think of Than. 
[03:35:30]  I only think of Dave.  He was a taller guy.  So, you're going to  go through this show.  Do you want to talk about  what happened with Fez outside?  Because we brought up Fez  earlier on O&A.  And, obviously,  Opie and Anthony's show  is not known for being  the most sensitive  of programs.  Just the opposite, yeah.  I think it's probably  the most insensitive  program ever.  Probably.  And so, I guess outside,  I thought everything  was going well  because I saw you  and Fez 
[03:36:00]  and Ant and Jim.  And, see,  we're doing this thing  where Fez is  dressing up for the show,  trying to get back  to his old voice.  I've been noticing  that he wears the hat.  He wears the Fez hat.  He was wearing, like,  a flashy disco shirt.  And he's going to start  and write some of the bits out  and do it old Fez style.  But what's happened  is that they brought up  that the building's shaking,  but very lightly,  you know,  like, subversively,  like, hey,  is this building moving?  You saw him go back 
[03:36:30]  to the wall.  He had to hold on  to the wall.  And then he said to me,  he goes,  can I go get you a sandwich?  And I go,  I don't know.  He goes, please,  can I go down to the ground  and get you a sandwich?  Because he had to get  out of here.  Yeah.  And I said,  you know what?  That's a great idea.  Go give me  a nice egg sandwich.  Hopefully.  Do you think  it'll calm him down?  Because the building's  not moving.  Like, the building  moved once  because there was  an earthquake,  but it's not moving today.  And it won't,  it might move on Sunday.  The weirdness  of this building  is it's already empty  to begin with. 
[03:37:00]  Well, I think  everybody's just using it  as an excuse  to take, like,  to get out of here early.  Nice three-day weekend.  Yeah, because there's no,  literally,  today's forecast  to be a nice day.  Like, there's no danger.  Yeah, there's no problem.  Today,  going into tomorrow morning.  Like, you could easily  put in a full work day  without being affected  whatsoever.  It's Sunday  before this thing  will even get here.  Yeah.  There's nothing  to worry about yet.  Now, why,  can that not get,  is Fez not focusing  on that fact?  That even if,  worst case scenario,  something catastrophic 
[03:37:30]  happens,  and it drops this building  to the ground,  that we won't be here for it.  See, I think when you're  in a phobic place,  I don't think logic works.  It has nothing  to do with logic.  It's something different.  It comes from  a different place.  Does he take the elevator  or the stairs?  Because I heard him,  on the,  I heard the earthquake show.  Take him take the stairs.  Why not?  Because the alarms  go off here.  Oh, so you can't  just take them?  You just can't  take the stairs  like we did on 57th.  But, you know,  don't you think  it's too far to walk  anyway?  Yeah, I mean, 
[03:38:00]  I don't think it makes  any sense to do it,  but I guess I thought  it should be an option.  Was he having  an easier time?  But he also got freaked  out when we were  just on 57th Street  and we were, what,  on the fifth floor?  Yeah.  I mean,  if you're kind of  in a freaked out thing,  and you'll find  something to freak you out.  Yeah.  You know,  it doesn't matter  what happens,  it's that you're  in a certain state.  So you were doing  O&A today.  Do you still find  that our show  is a little more casual  and lax sometimes  than the show 
[03:38:30]  that you put on?  Well, you know,  it was my first time  to do the Anthony  and Jim show.  Right.  The Opie and Jim show  is a completely  different show.  So, yeah,  today's show  was really like,  you know,  lunch on a job spot.  Yeah.  It was really nice.  It was even more  casual when it's Ant.  The thing with  the live read today,  which might have  confused people,  I don't know,  is because I told Ant,  you know,  take another break  at this time,  and Ant is the most  casual of casual people  saying,  why do we even need  to schedule a break? 
[03:39:00]  Let's just see what happens.  Right.  And you guys said,  why don't you just  give him the live read  during the show?  So Ant does the live read,  but he's so casual  that he forgets  that he was on the air.  Like,  have you ever been  in a situation  where you've forgotten  that you were doing a show?  No,  I can't say that I have.  And you've done long shows.  Didn't you do a marathon show  back on 57th Street  one time?  Right.  Yeah,  we've done those.  And then when I was  in Florida,  we would do the,  hey,  how long were these  packages last show?  So we would stay  on the air  until we ran out 
[03:39:30]  of supplies.  And that's terrestrial.  You didn't want to leave.  That's terrestrial.  That was terrestrial,  yeah.  That's a magic time,  though.  It was.  That's not here anymore.  So anyway,  coming up a little  later on in the show.  You can actually  audibly hear it.  Yeah,  you can smoke on the air.  It's great.  Our staff  is fully  in vacation mode.  And it does  help that  Ant  does not exactly,  you know,  he's a casual guy.  And that  rubs off  on the rest of us. 
[03:40:00]  I mean,  Erock showed up  in his plaid shorts  today,  ready to get on the boat.  And I've also heard  Erock that  you were  bragging in that room  while the show was on  that you were  in vacation mode  and that's why  it was okay  for you to have  a Whopper  for breakfast  this morning.  Jesus Christ.  Well,  Roland,  I know where he got it.  Roland had double  breakfast today.  What's double breakfast?  Well,  I didn't know  that Roland had went  and bought himself  breakfast already,  so I decided  to treat some,  you know,  people to  burgers for breakfast. 
[03:40:30]  And Roland goes,  no,  I already had.  And I go,  okay,  as soon as I took it away,  he snatched it back  and goes,  what are you doing?  And then he took it  and he ate it.  How come you didn't tell  any of us about burgers  for breakfast?  You're lucky.  Because you don't  eat hamburgers.  It seemed like a break.  I got shit like a racehorse.  Why would anybody think  that they could have  a Whopper for breakfast?  Because they sell them  for breakfast.  He looks so happy.  Did you enjoy it?  I did.  I'm not right now,  but I did earlier.  Listen,  I don't know if Travis  wants to comment on this  or not,  but it didn't come up  on the air, 
[03:41:00]  but there was a poll.  I'm going to tell you this,  Eric,  because I'm your friend.  There was a poll started  as to how much weight  will Eric gain  while he's on the cruise.  Of course.  Whoa.  I think,  no,  Roland,  don't say whoa  because you guessed  five pounds.  Is he,  in other words,  I guessed five.  So that's me,  though.  No, no,  Roland,  you guessed five.  I guessed seven.  Troy is.  Eric,  you know how much  Troy guessed?  Who cares what Troy guessed,  but go ahead.  I believe Troy guessed 
[03:41:30]  25 pounds.  That is correct.  Of course he did.  Well, I mean,  but look,  you started with Whoppers  for breakfast this morning,  doesn't exactly.  Yeah,  and Troy had one too.  Did he?  Yes.  But he's fit though.  He's a fit fella.  So,  Travis.  Yeah.  You were keeping track  of how much.  Someone's got to write it down.  So what are the numbers at?  I guessed five.  You guessed five.  I guessed five.  You guessed seven.  Right.  Roland guessed ten.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Troy guessed 25.  25.  Eric.  Which I found a little insulting. 
[03:42:00]  Are you planning on gaining weight  on the cruise?  I'm not planning on anything.  But it might happen.  Just planning on having a good time.  If you,  how much do you think is feasible?  I think 25 pounds is a little excessive,  to be honest.  15 maybe.  You think 15 pounds?  Well,  is it buffets,  the drinking?  Over the course of a week?  Should happen.  Eric,  how much do you think you'll gain?  I have no idea.  Guess.  I,  yeah,  I would say five would be  the most,  but in a week.  Well,  if you're gonna, 
[03:42:30]  if you're gonna hit five,  try to get up to seven,  because that's my number.  Where's the cruise still?  This one's going to Bahamas  and the Caribbean.  And you said you have an inside cabin,  where,  you really don't get to look out  on the ocean at all.  He,  this is,  Eric,  I know you don't like  all the attention being focused on you,  but it tends to,  for whatever reason.  We started the show  talking about,  Eric's wife and him  are traveling separately  to the cruise ship.  They have to go to Florida  to get on the ship,  obviously. 
[03:43:00]  And Eric's flying to Florida  like right after the show today.  And his wife  isn't flying until when?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow afternoon.  Like right  when the hurricane is starting.  No,  the hurricane's not starting  until like  Saturday night,  Sunday morning.  So Saturday night,  but she's flying  Saturday afternoon.  Airlines are already  starting to cancel flights  Saturday and Sunday.  Her flight's still good  from what we checked.  She's not going to... 
[03:43:30]  So is at her banks,  but it hasn't hit you.  She's not going to move it up  to Saturday morning?  I don't know  what she's doing  with it right now.  All I know is that  she has a flight  early Saturday afternoon.  Well,  speaking of  all this hurricane stuff,  Eric,  why don't you play  what Roland said  a few days ago  right here on this show?  I meant the...  Ah.  Jeez,  Eric.  But let's pray  for the hurricane though  because it could hurt  not only his  but Spencer's vacation too.  Yeah,  but it would also hurt 
[03:44:00]  Obi's vacation  who's on vacation  at the beach right now.  But the people  who are going  about to go.  Yeah,  but he's on the beach.  The hurricane,  he's on the...  But you get to enjoy  at least a week  of beachiness.  But he's supposed  to have two weeks.  Oh.  You prayed  for the hurricane.  I didn't pray for it.  You just said  let's pray for the hurricane  so it ruins  Eric and...  No,  you didn't  because then you  followed it up  with more questions.  You're confusing me.  No.  No,  it's blatantly obvious  what you said.  I mean,  he said he wants... 
[03:44:30]  I should start  my own religion now.  I'm like,  I'm sure.  He said he wants  to ruin  Eric and Spencer's vacation  and he said...  Spencer's...  And he said he's...  Yes,  you did.  I was tired of that.  I meant not ruin.  I didn't mean ruin.  I was not ruin.  Oh,  so you meant  pray for not a hurricane  so it will not ruin...  Spencer's...  But then how come  you said Opie's okay  with just having  a week on the beach  instead of two?  Well,  I don't know.  That's...  This is...  This is why  Roman's great  because he says  horrible things  and then he comes back 
[03:45:00]  and you're like,  what?  No,  I don't know.  That's not what I meant.  And then he just mumbles  until you go,  okay,  I guess he's right.  What can we say?  Yeah,  well,  at least on Sunday  the MTV Awards  will shout out  to New York,  all the rappers.  You think so?  Oh,  hell yeah.  They'll win the New York Yankees.  Well,  when are they going to LA?  This Sunday.  No,  no,  like when is everybody traveling?  I don't know.  I hope they're there already.  Yep.  You're supposed to...  I think they're canceling flights.  Already?  Mm-hmm.  Jesus. 
[03:45:30]  Eric,  you got to get your chick  on a flight to Florida today.  I'm trying.  How come she doesn't want to go today?  I mean...  Because she can't go today.  The company will let her off.  No,  they won't.  This company?  No.  All right.  In order to...  Yeah,  I'm not going into...  You don't have to say it specifically.  But she can't be off today.  So,  she has to work.  And...  She just doesn't want to fly  tomorrow...  Tonight?  She's not...  She's not...  She doesn't have a flight for tonight. 
[03:46:00]  She's not even packed.  She's not ready to go yet.  All right.  Well,  I mean,  I hope...  You don't think she's going at all then?  Yeah.  I mean,  because if her flight  isn't until  Saturday afternoon...  I don't think it's going to...  I don't think she's going to take off.  Yeah.  I really don't.  Because the subways are shut down  at 2 o'clock tomorrow.  And I mean,  even if the hurricane  hasn't officially hit,  everything's going to be  piled up by then.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  And I mean,  and there's not going to be  flights to make up.  Like,  she's not going to get out  anytime Sunday.  Do it, Sam?  I'm going to pray  that she makes it there. 
[03:46:30]  Thank you, Roland.  And when does the ship leave, Eric?  Sunday.  5 p.m. Sunday.  You got to get her  on a flight sooner.  What can we do, Eric?  Me and you.  Give me your credit card  and I'll buy her a flight tonight.  Are there flights  available anymore?  I'm sure there is.  I bet you're going to take  that cruise without her.  Would you, Eric?  Would you get on the boat  without her?  No, I can't do that.  What would you do?  Get on the cruise?  Because you're already  going to be in Florida,  so would you just fly back?  Yeah, I'd have to.  Ugh. 
[03:47:00]  And just spend the week?  Because I can't have,  we're not going to pay  to have, like,  if she can't make it  to the cruise  when it takes off,  to have her  fly to the first port  in order to rejoin the cruise.  But you're already  in vacation mode.  Like, I don't,  I want to see you,  you're diamond status.  You go on cruise,  like, you've been  looking forward to this.  I know.  The hurricane's  fucking everything up.  And you can't be like,  listen,  I'm not going to say  her name  because I don't think  you want to,  you know,  listen, wifey,  take a flight. 
[03:47:30]  Take a Friday flight.  Let's get you  a Friday night flight.  She can't.  She's like calling you  at you.  Why can't you go home  and pack for her  and get her ready?  Yeah, right.  Why is that?  Yeah, right.  No.  Just get her on a red eye  tonight.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work that way.  Yeah, it seems like logic,  but you can't do that.  You can't pack for your,  for your girlfriend  or for your wife.  But you can get her  on a red eye tonight  and she'd have time.  If she'll,  if she'll go and do that.  But she just doesn't want to.  I don't think so, no.  Does she not know  that she's going to miss the flight?  She knows. 
[03:48:00]  I mean,  her original flight was Sunday.  It was early Sunday morning.  She got it moved  to early Saturday afternoon.  Oh, that flight's  not going to take off.  Yeah.  But, Sam,  let's see,  women have to prep for vacations.  What do you mean?  The facials.  You can't just grab a bag  and let's go.  Is it possible  all that on the boat?  Yeah, that's what we see.  There's like spas  and stuff on the boat.  Spas already booked one.  Women don't prep before travel?  What are you talking about, Roland?  Yeah, they do.  Are you guys in my football pool? 
[03:48:30]  I don't know anything  about football.  You don't have to.  All you do is  you pick a different team  every week.  Does it cost anything to join?  No, it costs nothing to join.  Well, how do you join?  Two or two friends.  Got all the information.  She's in it, though.  I'll join it.  She's going to Twitter.  We got the big Lebowski signed.  Am I eligible for the prizes?  Yeah.  Well, then I'm in.  Because this is something  that's not even based on luck.  You've got to sit down  and pick one different team  every week.  And if you just pick  one winning game a week,  you can win the prize. 
[03:49:00]  So there's going to be  a prize every week  and then there's a prize  at the end?  No, a prize at the end.  Here's the thing.  If you pick the Colts  the first week,  second week,  you've got to pick  somebody besides the Colts.  Okay, so you can't just  say Giants all the way.  Yeah.  Well, why would you  if you want to win?  Like I said,  I have no idea.  Have you ever done this  before, Iraq?  I know, but I know  people have done it.  I've never done  the football stuff.  So if you win the first week  and you pick a different team  the second week,  you can still win again.  Yeah, you've got to  just keep on going  but it's going to be  a new team every time  you pick. 
[03:49:30]  Wow.  And then the other one  is just straight pick-ems.  So it's got to be  a new team every single time  or you just can't double up?  In the Eliminator, yeah,  you have to pick  a different winning team.  As soon as you pick  that team that wins  the first week,  second week,  they're not in.  That's pretty fun  You should have  an Emmitt Smith pick  when he comes in.  Would be perfect  to have Emmitt Smith.  Can I have Emmitt Smith  do some of my picks?  Yeah.  He's coming in the 7th  when we get back.  And the prize winner  is the Big Lebowski  sign thing.  On one of them  the Big Lebowski sign  and a football 
[03:50:00]  by somebody  I forget who.  Wow.  It's all on  two or two friends.  This is great.  I like that you guys  because this is like  the Ron and Fez show.  They just say  we want to do this.  We got a Twitter.  We got prizes.  We're just going to do it.  We bypass.  You know what I mean?  You just  we're doing this  because you know  if you brought it to anybody  it would just get held up.  It would have a lot of rules.  Right.  Now we're just doing it.  Right.  And somebody's going to win  Big Lebowski.  Yeah, Paul?  The football  there's two of them  one for each  Pat Summerall 
[03:50:30]  and Franco Harris.  All right.  Both those footballs.  And a Big Lebowski  and another movie  Full Metal Jacket DVD  signed by  Vincent D'Onofrio.  Oh my God.  And D'Onofrio  is not going to do any signings.  He doesn't even like  taking pictures.  He actually had a problem  with that.  He was like  shouting the whole time  he was signing.  Was he really?  This is fucking bullshit.  And you got it though.  I don't know how many other stuff.  I go just keep signing.  I go it's for the listeners.  Just sign it.  Right.  Sign it for the listeners.  We put you on  just sign the DVD. 
[03:51:00]  But you know what it's like.  You like sign stuff.  It's once in a lifetime stuff.  You're not going to get  you can't buy this  if you want it.  No.  And like you see  it's not cheap stuff.  Like you're not going to get  Lebowski or Full Metal Jacket  signed because these people  are never going to be  doing conventions.  Well these are manly men  prizes for the manly men  playing the football stuff.  And if anyone here  needs to prove  they're a manly man  it's me.  I need them.  I don't know  because you're  more and more masculine  every week.  I'm noticing.  Do you think so?  Yeah like this shirt  you're wearing today. 
[03:51:30]  What is that?  Well this is a Zack Ryder  shirt that WWE sent me.  That's broski.  I mean that's probably  not the best example.  But I like it.  You know I mean  again that's not  the best example  of masculinity  coming forward.  I'm going to  I'm going to  You know the thing  that proves any kind  of masculinity  though is how cute  your chick is.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well I'm doing alright  in that department then.  Yeah you're doing  very very well.  And so is Eric  for that matter.  And she's  of course he is.  But your chick  has a certain look 
[03:52:00]  about her  that I can say.  What do you mean  what kind of a look?  Let's party.  Doesn't she?  Like there's certain  girls like you're like  yeah I bet  she's an expert  in that field.  Well she knows  what she's doing.  I bet she does.  She has a good time.  I bet.  Loves it.  You know what  we're doing on  the Opie and Anthony  show is we're  trying to find a girl  for Bobo.  And this is a contest.  It's a legitimate thing.  Today's the last day  to enter as a matter of fact.  How's it coming so far?  We got a few entries.  A handful?  Yeah enough that 
[03:52:30]  we're going to have  to narrow it down  before we can pick  three finalists.  But there's Dave Marsh  walking by.  Oh my gosh.  The people that  just walked by.  Yeah.  Legendary rock critic.  Roland loves him.  Dave Marsh?  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  I mean anything Bruce.  I think he's put out  28 books.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  28 books.  I don't have one book out.  Well you got that  Ron Bennington quotes book.  You know what?  You're right about that.  That's true.  You were doing signings  for that book for a while  where people could just come 
[03:53:00]  and watch you sign the book.  Yeah.  Because I didn't want to  give him one away.  Yeah.  I love him too much.  It's just the one book so  you're not going to give it away.  But the Bobo dating game  basically three women  are going to get to come  in the studio  and Bobo's going to  they're going to have to  describe themselves.  Bobo's going to have to  remember what they said  and the girl he can  remember the most about  is the winner of the contest.  Oh no.  What's wrong?  No.  Just Bobo having to  remember anything.  Exactly.  It's going to be devastating.  How does he do  with the ladies Bobo?  Bobo? 
[03:53:30]  Not as well as you'd think.  Not as well as  Mike who was in earlier.  He hasn't picked up  Who eats the box?  Yeah.  He hasn't gotten a chance  to eat as many girls  as Mike had.  But Bobo  his passion for it is there.  He wants it bad.  And the thing about this date  is not only are you going to  get to get the date with Bobo  but you win a thousand dollars  and that doesn't  that's not paying for the date.  That's the thousand  if you take that home.  Is this probably  sound like prostitution? 
[03:54:00]  No.  And that was brought up  but you're not obligated  to provide sexual favors  to Bobo.  I mean if you two  hit it off  For a thousand dollars  you should blow him.  You think so?  I mean  I don't think  that's going to  I don't think  it's asking too much.  That's a should thing  but not a have to.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's not  yeah it's not written down  in the legalese.  Well it's a courtesy.  Sam's chaperoning it though.  But is it  well I mean  I'm going to  go with them  when they go  to get their lunch  but you know 
[03:54:30]  if something  happens after lunch  no Fez back yet?  He'll be back.  Sure.  He's going to get a sandwich.  I mean  he knows good sandwich places.  Bobo's on the phone.  We got to  if you want to  enter this contest  like I said  Hey when Bobo gets on  let's act like  we're really happy  to talk to them  in LA.  Okay.  Yeah.  We're really excited about it.  It's a thousand dollars  and that's kind of the key  because most people  are saying  I'm not going to  enter this contest  because I don't want  to go on this date  with Bobo.  But all you're doing  is going to lunch 
[03:55:00]  with the guy  and you get a thousand dollars.  Hey I know this  Asian girl in my neighborhood  will fucking make her  crazy for a thousand dollars.  Have her email us.  Put a strap on.  It's ObiAnthony  at SiriusXM.com  and you need to send  like a little paragraph  and a picture of yourself.  All the rules  that Ron and Fez  smartly avoid  are up at  SiriusXM.com  slash the virus.  It's Bobo everyone.  Bobo!  Yeah that's right  I'm here  and there's still  a good about 
[03:55:30]  an hour and a half  or so  to enter this contest.  That's right.  The contest is  officially closed  at noon.  Bobo's on the phone man.  The man.  Ron was just saying  during the commercial break  why don't we get Bobo  on the phone more often?  So Bobo  you're on  are you excited  about the possibilities  of this date?  Yeah I am.  Why is that?  What do you think  is going to come of it?  Things go right.  I could finally  lose the virgin label.  You're still virgin  are you Bobo? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  I still got that label.  Now what's the furthest  It's not just a label.  It's actually  What base have you gotten to?  Well  I don't even know  maybe I've made out  with a few girls  but that's about it.  That's a maybe though.  So we'll see  I mean  the thing about it though  is the girls need to know  you're not carrying  any diseases  like you haven't been  with a bunch of skanks  and girls like that.  You are a guy  who's saving yourself  for the right girl  and you're hoping 
[03:56:30]  to meet her  in a couple weeks  when we do this.  He's got what  they would call  an ivory snow dick.  Yeah.  And Bobo  you and I both know  that ivory snow dick  is working  and is very good  at standing in attention  is it not?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's very functional.  That's right.  What do you think  the odds are  that you're going  to get to use it  on this date?  I'd say  it's 50-50.  It just depends on  now what does it  depend on more?  The girl that wins  the contest  or just 
[03:57:00]  whether or not  you're on your game  that day?  It's probably  a little bit of both.  That's right.  What do you look for  Bobo?  What are you looking for?  Because like we said  we're looking for  a date for Bobo.  You're going to win  $1,000  just for going  on this date  and all you have to do  is go to lunch  with him.  Now if Bobo  is able to charm you  that's a different story  but you just go  to lunch  you get the $1,000.  SiriusXM.com  slash the virus  and that's where  all the information is.  So Bobo  tell me  what do you look for 
[03:57:30]  in a woman?  What should these women  like what would  your ideal woman  For one thing  if they got a good  sense of humor  that's definite.  You like a funny girl  you like somebody  you can joke around with.  Yeah exactly.  Streisand would be  perfect for her.  You ever think about  Barbra Streisand?  No.  Okay.  No is the answer.  What else Bobo?  Well it doesn't have to be  but if they  if they like baseball  that's good.  Baseball?  Oh man 
[03:58:00]  I'm getting feedback  this is Eric  going back to  your wife  it says  New Jersey Transit  is shutting railroads  down starting at noon  tomorrow.  I don't know if that's  true or not  just passing the  information along.  It is true.  That's insane.  So  Bobo's looking for  common interests  with baseball.  Yeah you're looking  is it okay  if she's a Phillies fan?  Yeah  yeah that's okay.  I mean you're a Mets guy  so I know that's  that's always been a  sticking point for you.  You don't mind having 
[03:58:30]  a girl  who likes a different  team.  Yeah  I don't have a  I don't have a  problem with that.  Okay  what about physical  As long as they  don't have a problem  going to Mets games  with me  I'm sure they won't.  Go to wherever  they  wherever it is  they go to go  to a game with them.  I got you.  Now I mean  that's a lot of  personality stuff  physical wise  Bobo I mean  we're men here  we you know  you like  to look at women  what do you look for  physically in a woman?  Well  we'll probably 
[03:59:00]  only if they look good  I have to admit that.  Okay  that's what  I mean I'm the same  way with women  it's like  hopefully they look good  what more  specifically?  Breathing.  Well  I don't know  I  did this one  I don't know  to describe this one  but  they're called boobies  like  yeah  you like  bust  bust size  you like  ass man  if they got  a nice  size  boobies  yeah  you like that  you like ass  or a little bit 
[03:59:30]  or a lot  or  well  let's just say  I don't know  if they got ass  if it's not like  too big  but it's just  the right size  like Kim Kardashian  is a little much  I'm not really  sure what to say  what to say  a little bit much  but if it's just  the right size  right  but you don't have  any point of reference  for that  yeah  like it's not  like how do I say  not over exaggerated  right  okay perfect  that kind of  clears that up  and how about 
[04:00:00]  hair color  I don't have a problem  with hair color  you don't have a problem  so it could be  so the hair could be  a color  okay  and how about  do they have to have hair  yeah  is it a bald chick  is that cool  not I gotta have hair  they gotta have hair  that's kind of  one of your sticking points  uh face wise  what kind of features  are we looking for  I don't really have  an issue with facial features  okay  so what you're looking for  specifically  but for some reason  I've had a fetish 
[04:00:30]  with women  that somehow  men look great  they have glasses on  alright  so what we're looking for  is a woman  with glasses  nice boobies  an ass  that's  uh  just right  hair  and  who's good looking  yeah  and that kind of  describe  are you  are you thinking  of your perfect woman  after that description  yeah  yeah  who is it  who are the celebrities 
[04:01:00]  I'm not sure  not sure about that either  okay  ethnicity  do you have a  preference with ethnicity  I like  let's see  uh  hispanic  hispanic  white  asian  hispanic  white  asian  that pretty much  covers a lot  uh  uh  european  hispanic  white  asian  european  do you get  not black though  it depends  on what  uh  I don't 
[04:01:30]  that one's  kind of hard  to describe  could you make  an effort  no  I don't  I don't know  how to describe that  but  okay  so we're looking  for  white  european  asian  hispanic  or  a hard to describe  a hard to describe  black person  yeah  do you have a  gender preference  female  female  okay  I'm glad we got  somewhere with that  that was good  bobo  um  are you worried  coming in here 
[04:02:00]  that you'll see  the three girls  on the couch  but you're not  going to be able  to pick  just one  based on looks  like you're not  going to be able  to say that one's  my favorite  you're going to  have to pay  attention to all  three of these  girls talking  and then remember  what they say  without writing  anything down  do you think  that's going  to trip you up  I don't think  it's going to  trip me up  how's the memory  how's the short  term memory  no  I know it's good  uh  what were some  of the things  that I just  asked you  you just asked  me about the  preference of  the girls 
[04:02:30]  that's very good  bobo  that is  that's very good  you do have  a good short  term memory  um  now  what can you  say to girls  to encourage  them  to enter  this contest  because we've  gotten a bunch  of entries  and we are  going to have  to narrow it  down  um  if you want  to enter  to win a date  with bobo  and get a  thousand dollars  it's  seriousxm.com  slash the virus  and email us  at opanthony  at seriousxm.com  so I'm just  going over the  numbers  looks like  we're going  to have to  narrow it  down from  four to  three  so right 
[04:03:00]  now  we've got a  lot on our  plate  bobo  I'm glad  Ron is here  to monitor  these emails  coming in  because they're  just pouring  in  how do you  sell yourself  to give us  a little more  to work with  here  well I could  say I'm  not a bad  guy  and I'm a  lot better  than what  people think  I am  what do  people think  you are  well like  some people  think I'm  dumb  where would  they get  that from  yeah I 
[04:03:30]  think that's  a big problem  that you face  bobo  I think that  like people  get to know  the character  you play  on the air  as bobo  the kind of  lovable  dimwitted  next door  neighbor  but they  don't really  know  Daniel Curlin  the guy  behind the  microphone  the real  guy  the guy  that you'll  end up  going on  a date  with  who's  actually  not only  intelligent  but charming  and deep  and yeah  and your  depth  goes beyond  what I think  people expect 
[04:04:00]  as well  yeah  yeah exactly  and what  they also  don't know  is that  I'm a  gentleman  at times  when I'm  with the  ladies  at times  not all  the times  but at  times  no but  when I  am  I try  to be  and what  was your  dog's  name  again  I got  two dogs  Rosie  and Mr.  Maloonigan  right Mr.  Maloonigan  okay  he's following  me on  Twitter  so  I'm glad  and I think  you mean  someone  pretending  to be  my  dog  no  it's  your  dog  I mean  he references  being in 
[04:04:30]  your house  and it's  definitely  your dog  yeah but  whoever that  guy is  he's basing it  on what he  knows  it's not a  guy it's a  dog Bobo  I mean  I've read  what he has to  say on  Twitter  it is definitely  your dog  well I'm sure  it's someone  pretending to be  my dog  on Twitter  now do you  think  that there's  a good chance  that you'll be  able to convince  the winner of this  contest to go  on a second  date  what's your  priority here  because I think  I really think  I could do that 
[04:05:00]  if it goes  very well  that's what  will happen  to me I think  in life  long term  planning is  much more  important than  short term  and I think  that's something  people should  apply to a lot  of things  including dating  do you see  this more  of a short  term mission  of let me  see if I  can convince  this girl  to let this  go beyond  a date  and maybe  hit up  like the  Queen's Motor  Inn or  something  right after  this date  or are you  thinking  I'm going  to play  the game  here  and just  have a nice  date  try to get  a second 
[04:05:30]  and a third  one  and eventually  I'll be able  to bring her  back to  Masbeth  where she  can meet  Mr. Maloon  again  yeah that  I'm thinking  which one  of the two  options  there were  two  eventually  the point  that I  can bring  her in  the Queen  that she'll  eventually  know  everybody  in my  household  so you're  looking for  love  Bobo  yeah  well if  you're going  to find  love  somewhere  Bobo  it's going  to be  here on  the Opie  and Anthony  show  and that's  kind of  where our  mission has  always been  is to bring  people together  do you still 
[04:06:00]  masturbate  with a  rubber  hospital  glove  because I  remember  you saying  that  yeah  yeah  I do  do that  with a  bunch of  KY on it  yeah  okay  well obviously  because otherwise  that rubber  on flesh  is just going  to result  in chafing  but hopefully  hopefully you'll  meet somebody  new that  can  you'll meet  a new  hand to put  that rubber  glove on  you know  what I mean  yeah  yeah  yeah  actually I  don't think  I'll probably  need that  glove  after that  did you 
[04:06:30]  just use  the one  glove  no  no  I don't  like no  gloves at  all  if you know  what I mean  I don't  explain it to me  I mean  on the hands  I mean  oh you're  looking for  like a hand  job from  a girl  yeah  that's what  I mean  I mean  I won't  need to  use the  the  the  the  and after  you  after you  after you  do this  activity  with the  hospital  glove  where  what do  you do  with  the  you know  the  byproduct  byproduct  that's a good  word Paul  all the  gloves  no no no 
[04:07:00]  the byproduct  the bodily  product  I don't  want to  ever clean  up  nowadays  what about  what is there  with a coffee  cup that I  hear  no there  are times  I accumulate  coffee cups  sometimes from  using them  when I've gone  to Dunkin Donuts  I've accumulated  a bunch of them  yeah and then  what do you do  with them  and I use  the empty  the used  coffee cups  I've  dropped my  load in a  coffee cup  so if you  want to  win a  date  with  Bobo  just go  to 
[04:07:30]  SiriusXM  dot com  slash  the virus  I mean  you'll also  win a  thousand dollars  but keep  in mind  it's a  date  with Bobo  the Don  Juan  of the  virus  Sirius XM  actually no  it's not  Sirius XM  Trojan  condoms  Trojan  condoms  was putting  up the  thousand  and that's  because  Trojan  says that  they want  to invest  in this  contest  because  if you  use Trojan  you won't  end up  with a  Bobo  so  that's  just what  they say  I don't  know  hopefully 
[04:08:00]  I'll have  use for  one  yeah  I mean  here's  hoping  if I  did an  ad  campaign  it would  be  put this  on your  dick  before  you  fuck  Trojan  what do  you think  of that  Bobo  I like  that ad  campaign  fantastic  have you ever  put a rubber  on Bobo  did you hear  that question  have you ever  worn a  condom  yeah  I have  years ago  when I  used to  have a  nocturnal  admissions  problem  so you 
[04:08:30]  would sleep  at night  with a  condom  on  yeah  a  nocturnal  admissions  problem  um  how  okay  would you  put it  on  while you  were still  soft  at night  yeah  I was  so annoyed  that I was  so worried  about that  happening  every time  that yeah  but you'd  be flaccid  and you'd  put a  condom  on and  then you'd  fall asleep  and what  you'd  you'd  grow into  the condom  during the  night  have a  nocturnal  admission  into it  and then  take it  off in  the morning 
[04:09:00]  yeah  why wouldn't  you just  unload the  tank  before you  went to  sleep  it was  a bit  difficult  to do  that  at that  time  he didn't  have a  coffee  cup  no coffee  cup  and he  also was  running  low on  gloves  so  what's  he gonna  do  how often  did it  happen  that you  I don't  know  I don't  know  if it  happened  like  every day  but  it just  happened  it happened  a lot  at random  like I didn't  know if it  was gonna  happen  so you  could just  go off  at any 
[04:09:30]  time  yeah  do you  remember  what you  were dreaming  about  Bobo  yeah  it could  happen  at any  night  I felt  Bobo  your dreams  what were  they about  oh  they were  about me  getting  laid  there were  times where  I've had  dreams about  getting laid  you have  any  specifics about  those girls  because I know  you're not one  for specifics  I don't  know  it's hard  to remember  freaking dreams  you doing  alright there  buddy  are you  wearing a  rubber glove  right now  because there 
[04:10:00]  would be  times where  I'd be  asking  you  about  and  they  would  give it  up  like  there  that's  very funny  Bobo  well listen  they're not  required to  give it up  right there  when they  go on a  date with  you  for this  contest  but who  knows  what will  happen  as  El Toto  from Brooklyn  says on  Feedback  Bobo  is a  sexy  beast  and that's  kind of  what a lot  of girls  have said  too  so hopefully  this has  really won  some of  you over  the contest  is closed  at noon  eastern  today 
[04:10:30]  so if  you're  listening to  this on  the replay  it's too  late  and you  just wasted  a lot  of time  but  assuming  you're  listening  to this  live  email us  right now  opanthony  at  seriousxm.com  check out  all the rules  on  seriousxm.com  slash  the virus  win a date  with Bobo  the winner  also gets  a thousand  dollars  so if  this hasn't  won you  over  I'm sure  you could  use a  thousand  Bobo  I really  appreciate  you being  a guest  today  alright  thanks  thanks  Bobo  thank you  guys  alright  buddy  surprised  he'd use 
[04:11:00]  a condom  you think  a finger  cot  would  suffice  he has  a very  small  piece  I mean  when he  says  condom  he means  saran wrap  with a  little  tiny  rubber  band  like  one  of  those  old  rubber  thimble  things  that they  used to  use  for sewing  back  is it  really  that  small  have you  not  seen  it  oh my  god  you should  have been  here for  one of  the up  and down  games  it's  really  it's  tiny  it's  embarrassing  were you  not  invited  he wanted  to show up  he has  seen another  guy's  penis  doesn't  come up  but I  mean  literally  is it  that  small  it's  probably 
[04:11:30]  fully  erect  like  yeah  like that  big  erect  three  I'll  give  them  three  to  three  and a  half  inches  fully  erect  so  like  the  you know  from your  knuckle  to the  top  of your  thumb  just  sticking  out  of a  mound  of  pubic  hair  so  this  woman  that's  going to  have  sex  with him  for  a thousand  dollars  it's  going to  be the  easiest  sex  she's  ever  had  she  won't  even  know  she  doesn't  she  had to  just  do  anal 
[04:12:00]  for  women  who's  never  tried  it  she  could  and  this  would  be  a  good  introduction  to  anal  but  she  doesn't  have  to  have  sex  with  him  there  will  be  a  security  guard  there  he's  so  excited  to  fuck  that  he'd  probably  get  one  pump  in  and  it  would  just  be  it's  not  going to  take  long  no  it's  not  that  explains  the  condom  thing  that  he  probably  put  it  on  like  a  blanket  just  wrapped  it  around  his  like  a  sleeping  bag  he  also  has  said  that  he's  willing  to 
[04:12:30]  go  muff  diving  if  he  is  a  romantic  you  know  can  you  imagine  him  trying  to  eat  pussy  what  that  would  look  like  I  mean  I  can't  imagine  me  eating  pudding  it  would  just  be  a  train  wreck  like  he  has  no  idea  what  to  do  I  don't  know  maybe  he's  a  savant  at  it  starts  chewing  on  her  labias  imagine  that's  the  one  thing  in  this  world  he's  actually  good  at  but  he  actually  thinks  eating  is  what  he's  supposed  to be  doing  there  was  no  woman  he  couldn't  bring  to  orgasm  he's  just  a
