<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in sexually suggestive banter,  followed by a discussion about the unusually cold weather in New York City, comparing it to other cities.  They also previewed a "Whipping them out Wednesday" segment and their daily "slave walk" between studios.  A caller introduced Barack Obama's presidential candidacy, sparking a lengthy, offensive discussion about the possibility of a black president and potential white American reactions, including darkly humorous hypotheticals about a Republican candidate facing child pornography accusations.  The conversation shifted to a YouTube video of cars sliding on icy roads in Portland, Oregon, further calls about weather, and criticism of the Mike and the Mad Dog radio show.  More calls focused on Obama and racial prejudice.

A substantial portion of the show centered on Rich Voss, a studio guest, and his Louis Vuitton handbag, which the hosts relentlessly mocked as feminine.  A bet was made about listener opinions on the bag's appropriateness for a man, leading to a planned Starbucks survey.  The broadcast then covered the story of a woman who died in a Sacramento radio station's water-drinking contest, resulting in ten firings, including the hosts' speculation on the reasons and comparison to their own past firings. The mysterious firing of "Carter and Fester" from Sacramento's 107.9 "The End" was introduced, along with analysis of the station's last ten songs played before the firing.  The hosts also analyzed the station's last ten played songs.  The discussion of Voss's bag and the Sacramento firings continued throughout the show.

The show also extensively covered a previous night's American Idol episode, focusing on a contestant's emotional breakdown after a poor performance.  The hosts debated the humor and exploitation involved.  A caller, Tom, expressed discomfort. Jason Itzler, a former guest who supplied prostitutes for the show and was incarcerated at Rikers Island, called in, complimenting the hosts and describing his former apartment.  A live Starbucks interview with Voss was cut short due to the hosts' disruptive behavior.  Further discussions covered American Idol and Muhammad Ali's 65th birthday.  The recurring "Wow" stickers and "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" bits continued.

A later segment featured another call from Jason Itzler from Rikers Island. He recounted a physical altercation with a transsexual inmate, "Angelina Jolie," resulting in hospitalization and a brain trauma diagnosis, and attributed it to the inmate's desire to transfer to general population for prostitution. Itzler discussed his lawyer, Paul Bergrin, allegedly managing Itzler's business while he was imprisoned, and mentioned other celebrity inmates at Rikers, including Lilo Brancato.  The hosts then discussed a news story about a lawyer found naked with his 14-year-old goddaughter.  The show played clips from the 1961 French film "My Baby is Black," filled with overt racist content, prompting commentary from the hosts and Voss. The final segment discussed the hosts' daily "walkover" to the studio, announcing a hiatus until March except for snowy weather.  Voss's microphone issues added to the humor.  The broadcast consistently featured profanity and sexually explicit discussions.

Further segments included a discussion on the physics of ice formation, with Voss arguing about a space between ice and water, prompting debate with the hosts, other callers, and a science teacher who called Voss an idiot.  This was followed by a discussion of a YouTube video of a brutal girl fight, leading to conversations about violence, racial dynamics in schools, and the hosts' childhood experiences with violence and extortion.  The show then played a clip of Borat's Golden Globe acceptance speech, discussing its explicit language and humor.  Finally, the show discussed and played clips from bad American Idol auditions.

The show opened another segment by rejecting a "rejoiners" audio clip as "faggy."  The conversation moved to American Idol, speculating on a contestant's eligibility. A news report about a man groping women led to a lengthy, vulgar comedy bit with punning on store names. Rich Voss participated in the bit and performed a poorly received juggling act.  A plane crash in Van Nuys (misidentified as New Jersey) and an EMT's tragic anecdote followed.  A segment featured the studio mascot, Sam, eating marshmallows.  Further conversation involved headphone preferences and a highly offensive exchange involving ethnic slurs and sexual innuendo.  A news report about a study on Indian men's penis size sparked more sexually charged jokes and derogatory comments.  The final segment covered Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie moving to New Orleans, leading to more crude jokes.  The show concluded with promotion of Rich's comedy shows, a discussion about a dog fighting website sponsor (bowdogfight.com), and a "line of the day" announcement, ending with banter about the show’s offensive humor.

[00:01:30]  Hi,  Fine, fine, whip them out Wednesday,  What?  Uh, maybe not, uh,  Maybe not in New York City,  No,  But a big news story here in New York,  But I'm sure they're going to whip them out in West Palm Beach today,  Yeah,  I'm sure they're going to be doing some whipping them out in, uh,  in, uh, Las Vegas, Nevada,  Oh, perhaps, uh, when the sun, uh,  comes up,  And I think they're going to be whipping them out in Dallas,  Yeah, well,  Besides that, the rest of the country, 
[00:02:00]  it's too cold for whipping them out Wednesday,  let's be honest with everybody,  Uh, this is the,  really,  the first cold day we've had all winter,  And all I can think about is the horror of the,  the, the, the slave walk we have to do  Every morning?  Every morning from this studio  Go away,  Oh,  Yeah,  Yo,  Oh,  This, this, uh, walk from this studio,  where we have to be,  because they don't trust us over there to do anything, 
[00:02:30]  and to the other studio where we have to go,  because they wouldn't trust us doing that show from here,  Uh, they need the control over us,  so we have to do this walkover every day,  and, um,  it's broadcast on XM,  but, uh,  you know,  it's been okay,  it's been in the 50s,  you know,  the high 40s,  it's been the coldest it's been for the walkover,  Early,  early,  low 60s,  Yeah.  In December,  Yeah,  uh,  but today,  um,  19 degrees when we pulled in, 
[00:03:00]  17 mile an hour wind,  for a,  a nice wind chill factor of,  of one,  They said like one,  Yeah.  So I was driving,  and,  um,  Hey,  chill man,  Buffalo and Chicago are listening.  I don't care,  I'm not there.  Right about now they're going,  Boo hoo hoo.  Yeah,  I understand.  Boo hoo hoo.  You know something though?  Screw you.  That's where you live.  And,  uh,  we live here,  and it gets cold here,  and if it does,  I'll talk about it.  Oh,  just as cold as the Windy City.  No,  I know,  Chicago's crazy, 
[00:03:30]  that's why,  you know.  Just trying to go local for Chicago today.  It's ridiculous cold in Chicago.  And,  uh,  if you pick up the Chicago Sun-Times this morning,  you get to vote for your sexiest Chicago bear.  Oh,  no you don't.  Stop it.  A lot of excitement in the Chicago Sun-Times this morning.  Where's my Sun-Times?  Well,  let's check out all the guys and see who,  who we want to pick.  Wow.  Every paper does that.  Here in New York,  they did,  uh, 
[00:04:00]  Who's Hot or Derek Jeter or Mike Piazza back in the day.  Remember that?  Who did you pick?  Well,  I,  um,  shut up.  Who did you pick?  Who?  Yeah,  it just got ridiculous,  and,  uh,  it's like very,  very cold out,  so I don't know.  All I'm doing now is,  uh,  having anxiety about the walkover.  That's all you care about?  I,  I can't,  I can't stand the cold.  So we,  when we do the walkover,  we kind of grab mics and talk about what's going on in the street. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  So first of all,  it's going to be so cold,  nothing's going to be going on.  Nothing but cold people walking.  Secondly,  I can't concentrate on anything else but how cold I am.  Like,  I'm not going to be able to interact,  hey,  there's a person doing this,  or there's something,  let's comment on it.  I'm just going to be bundled up going,  I,  the door to the other studio,  okay,  now it's a block away.  All right,  it's a half a block.  Okay,  I'm almost there.  I,  I can't deal with the cold.  Well,  we're going to cancel the walk in the very near future for at least a month, 
[00:05:00]  month and a half.  I like it.  By the way,  uh,  New York City,  19 feels like one.  Yeah.  Buffalo,  13 feels like two,  three.  Oh,  three.  Chicago,  15 feels like two.  It's the Windy City.  Oh,  minus eight.  Five.  Five.  So we're New York City colder than Chicago and Buffalo.  We have more colder,  real feel temperature or wind chill factor.  Good.  Good for us. 
[00:05:30]  We win.  So there you go.  Phones already.  That's a,  that's a good sign.  That means people are listening.  Uh,  our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  Do we go with this?  Do we go with that?  Let's go with Dave.  Oh,  Pennsylvania.  Here we go.  What's going on guys?  Say it Dave.  Say it proud.  Obama.  Oh,  Obama.  Obama.  You got it.  I was,  I was on the Obama kick a long time ago.  You guys are crazy.  Obama. 
[00:06:00]  You guys are insane.  If you think this country is going to vote in a black president,  I was giving Anthony scenarios in the office.  Yeah.  How Obama could win.  Oh,  it takes all kinds of secretive charges being filed at the last minute during the election year.  Like,  Ovi's got this all plotted out like an episode of 24.  Well,  yeah.  It's the only way a black guy is going to get in.  Speaking of 24,  that guy's had a hell of a week.  Ooh. 
[00:06:30]  Five seasons.  Five seasons.  Yeah.  Lucky,  uh,  it's not running all that for that.  By the way,  they're saying,  by the way,  they're saying no wowing in Dallas.  Cause it's snowing.  Yeah.  It's very cold.  Is,  is Dallas getting,  uh,  their,  their quarter inch of snow today where it shuts down the city.  They've gotten some ice down there.  That's what I love about Dallas.  So we've been down,  uh,  to Dallas a bunch of times,  Jimmy and I over the years.  And,  uh,  man,  they get like, 
[00:07:00]  it's not even a quarter inch.  It's like a,  a 16th inch of snow and it shuts down the city.  Clothes everything.  Oh my God.  Frosting.  Right.  Frosting.  Yeah.  Frosting.  Call the national guard.  We don't know how to drive on this stuff.  You know,  you get to see the,  the video of the cars just sliding around.  You're like,  what are they,  what's going on here?  That's the Portland,  uh,  Portland video.  That's out on YouTube.  It's hysterical.  Somebody's out on their balcony or something overlooking a street that was 
[00:07:30]  completely covered with ice and obviously on a downhill a little bit and  just videotape people,  um,  coming around the corner and not being able to stop and just sliding into  other cars.  And I,  I'm amazed at how entertaining that is.  Watch.  I watched it like three times.  People just come around the corner.  You go,  Oh,  here comes another one.  I've been there all night watching that.  That's why YouTube is the greatest invention ever.  Cause they would never show this stuff on regular TV and it's,  and you could just watch cars sliding on ice all day long. 
[00:08:00]  It really is fun.  I enjoyed the,  the new cars that came to the situation all filled with confidence that  they were the one car that was going to navigate the minefield of ice.  And the people on the balcony were kind of narrating a little bit because,  uh,  there were,  there were cars coming around really slow,  really slow around this corner.  And then they just slide sideways.  There's nothing they could do.  There was no friction left between tire and road.  The weight of the car,  that's it.  It's just pulling the car down into other cars, 
[00:08:30]  period.  No chance of you stopping.  The car makes the corner and,  uh,  hits the gas,  starts like picking up some speed.  And you hear the guy go,  Oh,  he ain't going to make it.  And then you just see his brake lights come on and the wheels are cut  completely to the right.  Yeah.  And,  uh,  there's no stopping,  no steering right into another car.  Are they taking bets?  No,  that would have been good.  Every car was crashing.  Yeah.  And one guy,  the first guy they showed wouldn't stop, 
[00:09:00]  uh,  uh,  hitting the gas.  You heard the engine revving the whole time.  Probably some old idiot in there.  God,  this guy just played,  uh,  look at that bumper car into a wall and then reverse all the way down the  street into another pile of cars.  Wow.  The video is up on op and anthony.com.  It's called the Portland.  What is it called?  Icy roads in Portland.  You can check out the video up on YouTube.  Hey,  Boston wants in.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston. 
[00:09:30]  Jared,  what's up?  Gary.  Hey,  Boston,  more colder,  more colder,  negative six.  Well,  I'm going with E-Rock.  E-Rock,  give me the official temperature of Boston.  So far,  New York is colder than that.  Yeah,  we're not going to take your word for it,  Jared.  Yeah,  we'll,  we'll,  we'll get the official temperature from E-Rock.  What?  I'm looking at weather.com with my zip code up in North Andover.  Oh,  one,  eight,  four,  five.  Oh boy.  Feels like negative six.  Oh boy.  It just went down to minus seven degrees.  Feels like minus seven in Boston. 
[00:10:00]  There you go,  Boston.  Enjoy.  All right.  Enjoy.  There you go.  You finally beat New York.  Uh,  let's go to Eric in Maine.  Eric.  Hey,  how's it going?  By the way,  Maine doesn't count because that's kind of,  that's like part of Canada.  That's South Canada.  That's South Canada.  Oh man,  it's cold as hell up here.  What's the official temperature in Maine?  Let's go with Portland,  Maine,  E-Rock.  You're saying it's minus five up there?  Yeah.  Yeah?  In Augusta. 
[00:10:30]  In Augusta.  In Augusta.  That's too cold,  but it's Maine.  This is our new bit.  So it's expected.  This is our new bit for the rest of winter.  We're just going to do the weather in every city in the country.  Yeah.  Stay tuned.  Either that or we're going to try to kill somebody.  We're not really sure which way to go.  Should we do this or kill somebody?  Speaking of doing a bit like this,  I got to tell you really fast.  I was at the gym yesterday and I go on the,  I was telling Jimmy,  my new thing is the stationary bike and I plug in,  you know,  so I could watch a little TV.  And,  uh,  it's kind of,  it's, 
[00:11:00]  it's local for New York,  but the rest of the country will understand.  Uh,  Mike and the mad dog,  they do a radio show.  I got a mad dog.  They're a sports show on a van on the fan here in New York.  Okay.  They,  and they're broadcast on TV.  It's a simulcast where they just show one shot of them in the studio,  looking completely bored,  looking like they don't even like each other.  Mike drinks,  just diet Coke the entire time.  Yeah.  No freaking energy whatsoever,  but they continue to get good ratings and,  uh,  and do radio here in New York city.  They stink.  That's right. 
[00:11:30]  They're boring.  They spent my whole time while I was on the stationary bike and I couldn't turn  it off going through the ratings of sporting events for the weekend.  That's very similar to our temperature bit.  Well,  that's what I was thinking as we went down this road.  I'm like,  where did I hear this before?  Oh,  look at,  uh,  they're all put up now.  Portland,  Maine two feels like minus 12 degrees.  So my,  so,  uh,  mad dog ant would go,  uh,  the Pats game. 
[00:12:00]  What was the,  uh,  the local rating and the national rating?  And,  uh,  Mike would go,  and it would take this long,  by the way.  Um,  I'm going to go with a 24 local and a 24,  one national rating.  Well,  Mikey,  pretty close.  It's the 19,  uh,  exactly.  Uh,  local.  And they pulled,  uh,  uh,  15,  uh,  national.  Uh,  you,  you went a little high on that one, 
[00:12:30]  but not bad.  You know,  I put it pretty,  pretty close,  pretty close.  And then Mike would go,  Hmm.  And then they would go to the next game.  They would go with college sports.  They would go with local hockey,  like Rangers afternoon game,  Bruins,  uh,  one o'clock game.  Local.  I got to give it an 18 too.  Dude,  they did this for 20 minutes.  I'm sitting there like,  who gives a crap.  You were captivated.  I was for a few minutes.  Anyway,  uh,  let's go back to Tim on long Island. 
[00:13:00]  Uh,  Tim,  what's up?  Yeah.  Listen,  the only way everybody's ever going to vote for,  uh,  Barack Obama will pull a leg up for him.  If it's going to make them swing for the rope.  Wow.  All right.  Good.  Good.  Wow.  No,  I mean,  Obama has announced that he's officially running,  right?  Hungry.  Well,  hungry for the,  uh,  Hillary Clinton face off.  Still not a complete,  total,  official commitment to running.  He's got one of those exploratory, 
[00:13:30]  explorer.  Yeah.  What,  what is that all about?  They put a,  you're running or you're not running now.  Now it used to be,  yeah,  you announced your candidacy and that was it.  Is it to save face?  Like they start,  uh,  getting some numbers in and go,  wow.  You put some feelers out.  Okay.  Put the feelers out.  And,  uh,  once you do that,  you're also allowed to start getting money.  I believe you get contributions.  So,  uh,  but,  um,  white middle America for the most part,  uh,  just ain't ready for it. 
[00:14:00]  Ain't ready for it.  The,  the,  the,  the visions that white middle America gets of a black president.  Isn't just a black president.  It's every appointee is,  is black.  And all of a sudden the tables turn and,  uh,  whitey is out picking cotton,  getting whipped.  It's just,  that's the vision,  the horrific vision that whitey has of,  um,  a black president.  Maybe,  uh,  they make new rules,  black president,  all white staff.  Would you accept that? 
[00:14:30]  I'm,  I'm bargaining here for white people.  Well,  that's what we're doing in the office.  I'm representing all white people in this country right now.  I'm excited.  It's something like Obama's running.  I think he brings an excitement to the whole,  Oh,  it's excitement.  All right.  The whole process.  That would be exciting.  So then that night we're negotiating in the office.  I'm like,  all right,  let's say Obama runs.  He gets,  he gets the democratic ticket.  Yep.  All right.  And then the Republicans,  I don't,  I couldn't even tell you who's going to be the,  uh,  the front runner or the,  or the, 
[00:15:00]  the main guy.  Yeah.  Let's say that let's say the Republicans get just the most amazing  presidential presidential candidate ever.  And it's so obvious.  He's just going to kick Obama's ass.  But at the last minute,  they find a child porn on his computer.  Then does Obama become president?  No,  they still vote for the Republican.  They'd rather have a pedophile.  Yeah.  They still vote for the Republican.  Gary Glenn at a play at the inauguration.  It doesn't matter.  It could have been a Republican that was on the dateline, 
[00:15:30]  uh,  pedophile specials.  Doesn't matter.  You're here to become president.  Yet you've had a sex with young girls.  Uh,  yes,  I did.  And I'm going to be president because I'm running against the black guy.  It doesn't matter.  It's just this country.  Even if he's called in the dateline house,  he could be in that dateline house.  And,  uh,  he's still going to be president overall,  overall.  Yeah.  Hey,  take a seat over there.  Take a seat. 
[00:16:00]  Oh,  uh,  uh,  what are you doing here?  Just dropping off some campaign posters.  Uh,  I figured,  you know,  I'd get some of the young votes for,  for my next term.  Uh,  if,  when I win,  uh,  this terms four years and a lot of girls that are now,  um,  you know,  underage will be of age when I run,  uh,  next time.  Uh,  you understand?  Because I'm absolutely winning this time because did you hear?  I'm running against a black guy.  You're free to go.  So, 
[00:16:30]  okay.  You're free to go.  I'm Chris Hansen.  And yes,  please go.  Please go.  We will destroy the tape.  Let's erase this tape.  And it's not even the trick free to go where you're like,  you're free to go.  And the,  and the cops are waiting for you outside the house.  The cops all of a sudden you walk out like,  Oh,  I know this gag.  I watched it so many times.  The cops are going to now arrest me as soon as I leave the house.  And also all of a sudden you walk out of the house and.  No,  I see it this way.  The cops recognize him as the only white candidate against Barack Obama and 
[00:17:00]  start doing that Ed Wood cop thing where they scratch the head with the  barrel of their gun and turn around.  They turn around and just start whistling kind of waving behind their  back.  Get to your car and leave.  We didn't see a thing.  It's just not going to happen.  All right.  It really,  America is not ready for it.  I think this is going to be a wake up call to a lot of liberal people that 
[00:17:30]  believe that we are very liberally advanced and we're ready to go with  something that we're ready to,  that we're ready to make a bold move like this.  Either Hillary being the woman candidate or Obama being a black candidate.  It just ain't going to happen.  I'd rather have black over female.  No,  I don't like Hillary.  Right.  I can see that bumper sticker.  Hey,  at least I'm not a. 
[00:18:00]  Looks like a math equation and overseas.  Yeah,  right.  You know,  it's not even so much that it's a black guy.  Well,  it's,  it is the fact that it's a black guy,  but not so much a woman.  Like the country is not ready for a black guy,  a woman,  perhaps,  but not Hillary.  Hillary's just been known to be too liberal.  She,  she,  you know,  had her own problems with her husband. 
[00:18:30]  You can't handle your husband.  You can't handle the country.  Your husband's there,  uh,  uh,  doing things in the oval office with,  uh,  interns and by things,  you know,  you know what I'm talking about.  And it just,  you know,  people are going to pull that out against her.  Yeah.  Not literally.  I don't think he's pulled that out for quite a while with her.  So the Democrats are going to just blow it again.  Uh,  yeah.  They're in a great position right now.  Goof ticket.  They're in a great position to take over everything. 
[00:19:00]  People want to vote Democrat.  They wanted to last time.  And,  and they got Frankenstein up against,  uh,  Bush.  Ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha,  ha, ha,  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It just ain't gonna happen.  Obama,  everyone's excited.  He's running.  Oh,  he talked about it yesterday.  It's on his website.  He's announcing this.  Everyone's excited. 
[00:19:30]  Uh,  we just see like what's happening,  um,  in the maybe liberal states and cities even,  not even states,  cities,  but middle America,  believe me,  a lot of those nuts are cleaning out their firearms.  Believe me,  they,  they,  uh,  will not stand for it.  Wow.  That's a bold statement.  There's still people that they,  they're trying to convince them to take down the Confederate flag.  Where's that?  South Carolina.  Well,  Atlanta had it flying at the state house at the state house. 
[00:20:00]  The last time we visited.  And they're like,  no,  we're not,  you know,  it's part of our culture and heritage and blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah.  Uh,  those are the people that aren't going to vote for Obama.  How about a conservative white Democrat?  A conservative Democrat,  like Clinton was more conservative Democrat with a black vice president or woman vice president.  Why don't Democrats do that?  I don't know.  It's still kind of that,  um,  that goof ticket.  It's kind of that good.  And they tried that once that Geraldine Ferraro.  Remember her for vice president? 
[00:20:30]  Oh,  Mondale though.  Yeah.  Well,  yeah,  it was with Mondale.  It was just a goof.  It was a goof thing.  They knew they were losing there.  They want to just make it interesting for us.  Well,  the Democrats shouldn't pull any shenanigans like this.  They should actually put someone in there,  uh,  uh,  a complete ticket,  president,  vice president that is going to get elected.  Not one of these things like,  well,  you know,  if the world was the place we want it to be,  they'd be elected.  And that's really what matters.  Republicans win.  You know,  that's pretty much their thinking.  Yeah,  whatever.  This is great,  man. 
[00:21:00]  You know,  we're going to try to enact and be so like,  people are going to love the idea that we're getting Republican for more years.  Good job.  I say Obama.  You keep saying it.  All right,  listen,  we're just getting warmed up.  We got some stuff to talk about today.  We have an update.  On the,  uh,  hold your wee for a wee radio show.  Hold your wee for a wee.  I guess the investigation,  uh,  that was going on,  uh,  is complete.  Yeah,  we've been following this story for the last few days.  We'll give you the conclusion.  Yes. 
[00:21:30]  Of this,  uh,  this,  uh,  little story arc.  The woman that died,  of course,  during a radio contest,  drinking water.  Seeing how much water he could drink in,  uh,  without going to the bathroom.  I would think an investigation like that would have to take weeks.  Oh,  of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  But apparently it's done and,  uh,  uh,  there is,  um,  a result.  And Dallas is bitching us because,  uh,  they're up to three inches of snow down there,  which is very,  very,  very rare.  How are the plows even out?  I don't know.  Do you have plows?  Yeah.  They probably had to call up Buffalo to send some plows down. 
[00:22:00]  If trucks would broom on them,  dumps.  They don't really.  Yeah.  Love that footage on the news though.  They just lose their,  you know what?  All right.  It's the O.P.  and Anthony show.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically it says,  whip them out Wednesday.  Big,  luscious,  juicy ones.  Right?  Wow.

[00:23:30]  The O.P. and A virus spreading across America.  So,  as far as the affiliates,  we're in.  Yeah.  Boston,  10 feels like minus 7.  That's the coldest city this morning.  The warmest city,  West Palm Beach.  What do they got?  It's going to go up to 78 degrees today.  Oh,  that's nice.  78 degrees. 
[00:24:00]  God damn fucking fast.  In second place,  San Francisco.  Yeah.  58 a high.  Rich Voss in studio.  And,  we were going to have him sit in the green room  for like an hour  and let the,  let the big boys do the heavy lifting.  But you walked in with a,  with a girl's purse or something.  God,  Rich walked in.  I think he did that just to get air time.  I really do.  It can't possibly be real. 
[00:24:30]  Rich walked in.  And you're walking around with that bag.  He walked in.  Let me set up the scene.  He walks in here  during the commercial break  and starts talking about  how he was in a hotel last night  and stuff like that.  And,  you know,  you couldn't sleep.  Yeah.  You know,  for whatever reason.  So,  I'm looking  and I notice on the other side of him,  it's not even like a bag that  if,  if I'm looking at one side of him  and it's on his other shoulder  that his body will cover it.  it's a giant grandma pocketbook  you're walking around with.  And I saw it jetting out 
[00:25:00]  from like the front and the back.  It's that big.  First of all,  it's not for air time.  I can't,  you know,  first of all,  it's not for air time.  Rich said I brought it in to get,  he's kidding.  Oh,  okay.  Dude,  that's a,  you know what?  That's a coach bag.  And you know why I know it's a coach bag?  It's not coach.  This is Louis Vuitton.  Oh,  Louis Vuitton.  Louis Vuitton.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  You didn't,  we didn't get this at the gap,  but let me,  I don't shop in the gap.  Oh,  whatever.  Coles.  I don't know. 
[00:25:30]  This thing,  it carries a computer.  It carries.  Dude,  it's a girl's bag.  It's not a girl's bag.  It is a,  it is a girl's bag.  Rich it is.  You want,  you want to take a survey?  We got the pal talk cameras.  We got people all over the world.  No,  looking at us through the show.  Show the pal talk cameras your bag.  You should be,  there's not one person.  And I swear to God,  Rich,  it's so easy to beat you up and stuff.  Yeah.  And we ride you pretty hard sometimes.  There's not one person in our audience.  That's not going to say that's,  that's not a girl's bag. 
[00:26:00]  There are computer bags that you can have,  that you can hold a laptop in accessories,  things.  And not one person would say,  oh my God,  that is a woman's pocketbook you are holding.  It would look like a computer bag.  Yeah.  If it was,  if it was a black,  then maybe you could get away with it.  But the cute little side saddle bags on the side.  And the LV logo,  the Louis Vuitton pattern on there and everything.  This is the style,  man.  Style for what?  Yeah.  In the village in San Francisco,  you should be carrying tampons at that.  He is. 
[00:26:30]  Are you coming out of the closet today?  No.  Yeah.  Look,  that's like a bag.  That's a man's bag that could fit a laptop.  You can get a bag like this anywhere for $10,  $20.  This is almost a $2,000 bag.  $2,000 to look like a homosexual.  It was $1,800 bags.  $1,800 bags.  No.  Hold on.  $1,800.  Because we know Rich, too.  You bought that.  Yeah,  it's a knockoff.  And you bought it from a Nigerian on the sidewalk.  You're 100% wrong on this.  You went into a store and bought that.  And they didn't laugh at you. 
[00:27:00]  I bought this for me.  Didn't you get my message when I went back into Louis Vuitton  and they didn't want to wait on me?  I left you a message.  They didn't want to wait on me.  Why didn't they want to wait on you?  Because I brought all the homeless people.  Because they're used to waiting on women.  Because I brought all the homeless people into Louis Vuitton.  And the Chinese guy goes,  I remember you.  Okay,  I didn't get that message.  So this is an 1800,  it's a real Louis Vuitton bag.  This is the kind of stuff you walk through an airport with your computer  and people go,  oh.  Oh,  look at this guy.  He must be going to San Francisco.  He must be going to San Francisco.  You know, 
[00:27:30]  it's so funny because you guys are sitting here.  No offense,  but you can't fight back on this one.  That is so girly.  The price doesn't justify what it is or looks like.  If it's 1800 bucks,  you know,  you could buy other women's clothing for 1800 bucks.  Rich,  we've done a lot of traveling in the last year.  The long dress will cost a lot of money,  yet you will not look manly in it.  We've done a lot of traveling in the last year.  Not once did I see a guy carrying a bag like that.  No.  I don't know. 
[00:28:00]  I think.  It's even too faggy for gay guys.  You should be swinging that at a larger man calling him a mesher.  Here's the thing.  I think you got Bonnie really buy that for you.  Yeah.  Wow.  She,  she bought it for herself.  You know,  that was to emasculate you a little bit.  No.  Yeah,  I think it's nice.  I love it.  No,  I think it's one of those things where you buy something for someone knowing  they're not really going to like it in the end.  And then she'll get it.  Yeah.  She's,  she's,  she's got her eye on that.  Leave it to Voss. 
[00:28:30]  He's holding onto it.  And she's at the hotel room going,  man,  it's been a month.  I can't believe he's still carrying that bag around.  It's going to be mine by now.  Embarrassing.  You take,  if you put this on pal talk,  you ask,  you can take a photo.  No offense.  Oh,  I already have.  Hold on.  I can't read the word fag and queer fast enough.  How much you want to bet?  I have no problem betting you a lot of money.  There's no way you get,  I,  and I'm not,  I'm not,  we could,  we could do an independent poll.  I don't care.  Cause yeah,  the pal talkers,  they love beating you up.  Yeah.  You're going to lose,  man.  You can't go out. 
[00:29:00]  You can't.  Here's what you got to,  here's what we'll do.  You can't go by guys that live at home or that are 16 or 17.  You got to go by people.  That's not our audience.  Rich.  I know,  but okay.  Of course your audience is going to go gay.  They're going to go gay.  But when you go,  if you go into any store or any fashion person,  or you know what I'm saying?  They'll go,  yeah,  that's a stylish type bag to carry.  How about this?  Exactly.  Stylish type bag.  How about this?  What?  You go to Starbucks right now.  They're lining up for their dumb coffee. 
[00:29:30]  We'll go down there with a cell phone and we'll independently ask people online.  At Starbucks?  Yeah.  I'll do that in a second.  Yeah.  He should be grabbing a towelette out of that bag and wiping a gentleman's belly.  Who wrote that?  I'm not even going to.  Pologna drapes.  I'm not even going to destroy it,  man.  I want to see you walking around with that.  Dude,  that is girly.  You don't like this for real?  Holy crap.  No. 
[00:30:00]  Like,  everything about it,  I don't like.  Even the,  let me feel like what it's made out of.  It's leather,  right?  No,  I don't know what it is.  It's some kind of.  Boss,  even if that bag was completely black,  it still would look kind of girly.  Plastic?  Because it's got the side saddle like bags.  I can't really explain it,  but little,  little bags on the side.  Someone says it looks like women's luggage.  When more people get to Starbucks,  I'll walk down there and I'll,  and I'll do a survey with anybody.  Are you going to be shocked when everyone goes,  no,  that's a girl's bag?  If more people say it's a girl's bag, 
[00:30:30]  then I'll go return and get something else there at the store.  That's what I'll do.  Guys don't shop in that store to begin with.  I know.  I don't think they have a guy's bag in there.  I've never heard of guys going in there to shop.  I really don't think,  unless there's a wallet maybe.  Yeah,  okay.  Let me see the wallet.  Even,  even the wallet looks a little off.  Oh,  wow.  Wow,  rich.  The whole store is the woman's section.  What do you put in there?  Your hormone pills?  I don't have drugs.  I don't have, 
[00:31:00]  I don't have,  I have nothing,  but every now and then to spend a little money on something.  I understand that,  but I,  I got four sets of dollars.  Hey man,  if you like it,  that's all that matters.  It looks like a diaper bag,  people are saying.  Yeah,  it does.  It looks a little like a diaper bag.  That's the type of bag,  like a rich girl from like the Upper West Side would carry around.  It's an old Jewish lady's bag.  Yeah.  Oh.  No,  it is.  I'm going to go find out.  That's why.  He walked in here with his bag.  He wanted to show it off.  Rich wanted to show off his latest purchase. 
[00:31:30]  Over your shoulder.  Yeah,  it was over his shoulder.  He's walking in.  Can't a guy get by with anything?  Rich,  I know I'm tough on you some mornings.  I will openly admit that.  Yeah.  But this one is so easy.  It's,  it's not even funny.  But I didn't bring it in going,  it's so easy.  Hey,  there's going to be trouble.  I got my sunglasses and my,  why do you have to carry a computer around with you all the time?  I don't have the computer now.  Oh,  I had clothes.  No,  no,  no.  Where are you staying,  by the way?  I don't know.  I'm in New York.  Really close,  right?  Yeah,  not too close.  Like there's no reason for him to have that bag with him right now. 
[00:32:00]  He brought it in to show it off.  No,  no,  and now he's really bummed out that we didn't,  that we weren't all,  ooh,  wow,  look at that.  I thought maybe you would have said,  hey,  that's a nice bag.  Did he even do the runway turn like they do on their models?  Yeah,  when they're modeling those bags.  Geez.  Someone's asking if it came with a fanny pack.  Did you have to trade one bag for another?  Which is like,  can't I get by with anything?  You can,  B-I,  with that stupid bag. 
[00:32:30]  You're going down to Starbucks,  seven o'clock.  Yeah,  I'll go down to Starbucks.  You think there'll be people there at seven?  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah,  this one's going to be really easy.  How are we going to do it?  Because I don't want to like,  you know,  bias any of the people.  Yeah.  It won't matter.  You can just go up and go,  uh,  do we send Steve down?  I think we send two people.  Voss doesn't say anything because he would word it in a way where people might say,  yeah,  it's a good bag.  And then just ask,  do you think this is, 
[00:33:00]  uh,  this bag is appropriate for a gentleman?  So you said a male or female bag.  So it doesn't,  you can't go,  is this a gay bag?  No,  you don't even have to give him a choice.  Like,  is this an appropriate bag for a man?  And then you could say something like,  would you rather have this bag or a Mickey mouse flying out of your sweatshirt?  Oh,  I got a Disney,  uh,  is that what you'd rather have?  It's a seven year old.  What are you trying to do?  Get two boys in your house in Missouri or something.  All right.  Okay.  At least I couldn't fit him in that bag. 
[00:33:30]  Well,  no,  I could fly all over the place.  this,  uh,  this kept me warm on the chilly,  uh,  Florida evenings.  Oh really?  Well,  I was strolling through Epcot.  That would keep you warm too.  And now it's cold today.  So I wore a Disney sweatshirt.  Is there a problem?  Yeah.  I think as far as gay goes,  I could,  I could have sex with Mickey mouse and it's not as gay as carrying around that bag.  That is just a woman's pocket book. 
[00:34:00]  Okay.  That is mommy's pocket book.  I bet it smells like baby powder and peppermints and like grandma's pocket book.  Now you're getting really upset about the Mickey mouse thing.  Relax.  Here's the thing.  Okay.  If I'm right,  if more people say it's good for a male,  you're delusional.  What do I get out of it?  I don't want anything,  but maybe an apology or you were right.  An apology?  No,  that's not going to happen here.  You are delusional.  You're delusional.  People will look at that and think. 
[00:34:30]  You're really going to be in shock when,  when people say that it's a girl's bag.  No,  I'm not.  You really are.  You really believe that's a guy's bag.  Let's,  uh,  let's say hi to,  uh,  Ben in New York.  What's up,  Ben?  Hey,  Ben makes a lot of bags.  The ones with LVs,  no question,  are for women.  They make men's bags,  but the LVs are for women.  The LV ones,  the ones with the logo,  are for women.  You guys know what we're talking about?  It's like brown with the LV logo all over it.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  This dang and age. 
[00:35:00]  First off,  half your listeners can't spell LV.  First of all,  have you ever been to this,  uh,  airport and seen some of the luggage?  Men carry the LV luggage.  Is that girl's luggage?  I,  I've never,  I've never seen a guy,  carry a LV luggage.  We have been traveling like maniacs,  and I've never seen the,  uh,  baggage carousel and an LV bag come down and a guy go,  this is mine.  This is mine.  Here it is.  This is mine.  All right.  I,  maybe I'm wrong.  I doubt it. 
[00:35:30]  You're a first.  I wish I could say,  you know,  Rich,  uh,  there was a guy I saw.  It was only one other guy I saw with a Louis Vuitton bag.  He doesn't exist.  I've never,  ever seen another man carrying one of those bags.  I did.  Andrew Cunanan,  when he shot Versace.  Yeah,  the only other guy that had a bag like that.  Uh,  uh,  well,  we did that one.  You look like you're perpetually,  you perpetually have your girlfriend or wife in a dressing room at a store in a mall. 
[00:36:00]  You're just holding her bag.  It's like,  it's the only time a guy should be holding that is when his girl is in the dressing room and you have to stand there like the pee whipped ass you are.  And just awkward.  Oh,  yeah.  I'll hold it out with between your thumb and forefinger.  It's not mine.  But,  but you're,  you're proud of that and whatever.  Uh,  1800 bucks.  I don't know.  I just spent my money a little differently.  Why?  It was a Christmas.  Well,  actually she spent 1300 on the Christmas present. 
[00:36:30]  She got me a,  a different Louis Vuitton.  Uh,  Oh my God.  Uh,  what do you call a computer bag?  A different computer bag?  Yeah.  But my computer infinite.  So I returned that and I got this and I had to throw in 500 of my money.  I took 1300.  What is it?  So,  and now he's taking full credit for the 1800.  You're lost.  I'm going to tell her to give me 500.  Rich is lost.  Yeah.  Why?  You're a lost soul.  Why don't you just tell her,  uh,  this kind of stinks.  I'd rather get something else.  Are you keeping it because it was Bonnie's gift and,  and you know,  the exchange thing and this, 
[00:37:00]  it's like,  yeah,  it's not quite what I want,  but,  but it's great.  And it's great and everything.  No,  cause I don't exchange stuff.  I just give them to Norton for birthday presents.  But here's the thing.  I like Louis Vuitton stuff.  I mean,  not a lot of it cause it's too flashy and stuff to play.  That thing is the ultimate in flash.  Like Louis,  but you're showing off the fact that it's a Louis Vuitton and it's a woman's bag,  which makes it even more obvious.  I don't know.  I walked through airports.  People still recognize me. 
[00:37:30]  Some do.  And I go,  Oh,  that's that guy from TV or from ONA.  You have a tough crowd.  I look at that guy from TV.  It looks like he came out of the closet.  Yeah,  I guess,  uh,  that's,  that's,  that's,  I better call star magazine.  I got a scoop.  What they say is there's that guy.  He has the same accessories as a TV.  All right,  Rich,  you're going to Starbucks.  All right.  Could you look that up?  What?  Is there a Louis Vuitton site?  Look that frigging bag up and see if it says woman's bag or if there's any female attachment. 
[00:38:00]  Women's apparel.  What section it's in?  I bet you it's under the women's apparel section.  It's got to be.  Is it a relatively new bag?  By the way,  for the rest of the country,  so you,  you too could laugh.  We're going to get that picture up on opianathlete.com very,  very soon.  Uh,  we got Rich modeling his new bag that he's proud of.  Modeling on the catwalk.  On the catwalk.  It's like Project,  uh,  all right,  listen,  Project gay.  All right, 
[00:38:30]  listen,  he's getting the website.  We're getting the picture up on opianathlete.com.  Rich is going down to Starbucks.  Huh?  Uh,  Voss,  uh,  Voss's photos are up.  So let the people check them out for a couple minutes.  In the meantime,  just a quick update.  Uh,  a Sacramento,  uh,  a Sacramento radio station fired,  fired 10 employees Tuesday,  including it's three morning.  This jockey's after a mother of three died following an on-air water drinking contest last week at the station studios. 
[00:39:00]  Oops.  We've been following this studio,  uh,  following this story since it happened.  It was a,  uh,  it was a hacky radio contest where they brought people in and,  and they had to hold their we to win a we.  A we.  W I I.  Right.  And this woman,  uh,  she came in second place,  went home,  had problems and,  and died.  Died.  From too much water.  Preliminary results.  Uh,  the autopsy isn't in yet,  but the medical examiner said it was,  um,  water intoxication.  Wow.  So she,  yeah,  she sat there. 
[00:39:30]  They said she drank something like two gallons of water in a very short period of time,  relatively anyway.  And,  um,  uh,  dropped dead.  And we said fired.  So fired.  So completely fired.  This is what so fired means.  It means everyone gets fired.  The heads came off.  This was,  uh,  one of those deals where they said there was going to be an internal investigation.  They were suspended indefinitely,  which they said that,  and you know,  they were telling them all the things we've heard.  We'll get you back on the air.  We just kind of have to sort out,  you know,  exactly what happened for legal reasons, 
[00:40:00]  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah.  You go into meet with lawyers and other upper echelon of the company and you tell them  who else was involved.  Uh,  salespeople,  uh,  program directors,  marketing,  marketing,  any other management people or on air people that were involved in this,  whatever salesperson,  your show producers,  got the way right for the contest.  Exactly.  And then,  uh,  they round all those people up,  have them dig their own grave, 
[00:40:30]  put the gun to the back of their head and fire the trigger and pull the trigger.  And that's it done.  We had no doubt that we're going to get fired,  but,  uh,  it's pretty amazing.  It's pretty amazing how many people they fired.  This is 10 people were fired.  Is that a record?  For Radio Stunt Gone Wrong Firing.  How many people did we have fired?  One.  Well.  Two.  Well.  Three.  Rick Ben five.  Okay.  Stinky six. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Six.  Um.  Mark.  Uh.  Gentlemen.  Your PD.  Seven.  Eight.  At least eight.  Eight people.  They might have the record.  Steve didn't get fired.  No,  because he wasn't working for the show officially.  Wow.  Eight.  So they break the record with 10.  10 people.  10 people.  Yeah.  The hosts of,  uh,  the morning rave who go by the,  the on air names,  Trish,  Maney,  and Lucas were fired a day after the station announced it was, 
[00:41:30]  uh,  suspending the show and investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of  jennifer lee strange.  John Geary,  vice president and general manager of KDND made the announcement Tuesday in an email  to reporters.  Effective.  Immediately.  The morning rave program is canceled and 10 employees are no longer with the station.  You want to list all the people that got fired here at a company spokesman,  uh,  Charles Sipkins confirmed the three DJs as well as two other on air personalities, 
[00:42:00]  Carter and Fester.  Carter.  Not,  not Carter and Fester.  That's what I said.  How could you fire Carter and Fester?  No one's heard of them.  Who the hell is Carter and Fester?  I got to get to the bottom of it.  These frigging news organizations never give enough info.  Carter.  Why was Carter and Fester fired?  If there are other on air personalities,  are they part of the morning rave?  Are they another show that was in,  are they like a Ron and Fez would be to our show where if they were in also kind of early, 
[00:42:30]  having fun with a bit we were doing and we killed a listener,  they'd be fired too.  They probably came in just to check it out and made a couple of comments.  That's a couple of fun comments.  I'm part of the fan club of Carter and Fester.  Carter fired like this.  Carter and Fester.  Not Carter and Fester.  That's the most disappointing part of the story I've heard.  Five other employees who worked on the morning rave were also let go. 
[00:43:00]  All 10 were fired.  A spokesman said for violating terms of their employee agreements.  I've read a lot of contracts, radio contracts in my day.  In our contracts?  There is nothing that says you can't kill a listener.  There's nothing that says you should,  but I haven't read one thing that says you can't kill a listener with a stunt.  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's see.  The morning rave, been on the air about five years, 
[00:43:30]  was one of Capitol's top-ranked morning drive programs.  That's the most tragic part of this whole story.  Read about the B comic with the big lips that was in studio that day.  Oh, okay.  It's a Mercurio joke, I gather.  Voss, why'd you whisper it into the mic?  Yeah.  Voss is not smart.  I can't stress to the new listeners how dumb Rich Voss is.  I just can't stress this.  You like this?  Come on.  Don't tell anyone what I just said. 
[00:44:00]  Like, people at home can't hear that.  Next time you do it, pull your ventriloquist dummy out of your bag and use him.  It's like...  That friggin' bag.  You mean her, it's madam.  He just whispers secrets into the mic.  Hey, Jim.  This is Rich Voss.  I know you're the only one that knows I'm gay.  No, no, it's...  Keep it between us, all right?  It's a whisper into a microphone going out to millions.  Since I'm only looking at you, you're the only one who can hear it.  Oh, you dolt. 
[00:44:30]  That's great.  Whispered.  Paul.  Oh, Paul.  Hey, someone's bringing up a good point.  Maybe Carter and Fester just sucked and it was a great excuse to get rid of another show.  To get rid of them?  Yeah.  I've never heard of Carter and Fester, even during this whole story.  We've been to the Morning Rave's website. 
[00:45:00]  Do you remember seeing Carter and Fester as, like, characters?  No.  Nothing.  I'm obsessed with Carter and Fester now.  I need to find out about Carter and Fester.  Give us some info on Carter and Fester.  We need intel immediately.  All right.  I want to know why they were fired.  Yeah, definitely.  But it was very obvious that everyone was going to get fired.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Yeah, that investigation took a day.  You ever died from that much water?  Huh?  Yeah.  Usually fraternity guys.  Yeah.  Frat hazings. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's very rare.  And marathon runners sometimes.  Yeah.  Drinking too much water.  I was so done.  I'm like, nah, because they won't.  They won't.  You know, I was so stupid.  They were like, no, they're done.  They were done.  Ope brought up the best reason, too.  Because you're thinking, well, they killed somebody.  And then you think, well, they probably feel bad about it.  I mean, you know, to fire them.  You know, I'm not sure.  I'm sure they weren't on the air, like, laughing about it.  Well, they weren't on the air.  But Ope said, how do you then go on when you finally get back on the air and continue doing 
[00:46:00]  your, you know, Wednesday promotion?  What was their Wednesday thing?  I don't know.  Looney Tunes Tuesday.  It was one of those, yeah, how do you possibly go back on the air and go back into that two  guys in a whole radio show?  Right.  How you doing, everybody?  Beautiful morning here in Sacramento.  We killed somebody.  Oh, my God.  That's like, that's all you can do.  It's a great morning to kill somebody.  I feel bad for this stupid show, man. 
[00:46:30]  You don't mean to do that.  And then you're fired.  You absolutely don't mean to do it.  You're fired.  Yeah.  You're fired.  And now you got to sit there.  They're in their office thinking they're proud of themselves.  They finally did some kind of great benchmark bit.  The city's talking.  And all of a sudden, they get that first phone call.  Oh, we might have a problem.  There could be a problem.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Yeah.  Because I was just thinking, like, all right, and the contest is over.  She's dead.  They know.  But the whole chain of events that happens, you're home.  You're like, yeah, it was a good show, man.  We did the water drinking show. 
[00:47:00]  And then the phone rings.  And then, yeah, what's up?  Yeah.  We got a big problem.  You're like, big problem?  What's it not?  We couldn't get the Wii?  Don't tell me we can't get the Wii to give to the winner.  No.  You remember the girl that was in pain and had to lay down on the ground during the show?  Yeah.  Yeah, that made for some great radio with her screaming.  She was cramping up and stuff.  Yeah, we had some real funny remarks.  Carter and Fester were laughing their asses over there, whoever the hell they are. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  She died.  What do you mean?  I mean, what I said, there's no, like, figuratively speaking.  She's dead.  She's dead.  The girl, the woman that was in there for the contest is dead.  You might want to turn on the news.  It's all over the news?  Is there just all out bawling?  All right, look.  Is there any way we could pin this on Carter and Fester?  And we can walk. 
[00:48:00]  I'll turn states on Carter and Fester.  Carter and Fester.  I love them.  Hire them immediately.  Let's find out about Carter and Fester.  We'll let you know about Carter and Fester.  Poor innocent bastards.  E-Rock can't find any info on Carter and Fester.  Is the website completely different?  Oh, God.  Oh, they've already.  See, you know.  Pop it up on that monitor up there.  Most people know, the faithful listeners know that Anthony and I are experts at this type  of thing.  Oh, we've been through the mill.  New listeners maybe don't know. 
[00:48:30]  We've been fired twice for some high-profile things.  And as soon as you get fired.  Me and Oprah are like Barnes and Elias, and everyone else is just a newbie waiting for  a body bag.  We know it.  We've seen it.  Just shut up about it.  There's only two DJs listed.  Oh, no.  And weekends.  That's it.  I looked at them.  They used to have a huge picture of their morning show.  The morning rave.  Now they just don't exist anymore.  They flushed them all out.  Stalinism at its best radio.  They never existed. 
[00:49:00]  No, comrade, that show was never here.  Their station slogan is perfect, though.  107.9, the end.  The end.  You listen to this show, it's the end of your life.  The end of the contestants.  The end of the road.  The end of the show.  The end of Carter and Festa, whoever the hell they are.  Not to be selfish, but I mean, there is an open morning slot.  Yeah, hey, Bob Eatman, get on the phone.  Oh, my God.  Keep the page right there.  Yeah, so when you get fired, the website completely gets hosed down, and they make 
[00:49:30]  believe you never existed.  You never lived.  And it's business like usual, by the way.  And this is how stupid they still are in Sacramento at 107.9, the end.  They got the last 10 songs played on the station because there's a lot of music.  You see what number one is?  Before I get to number one, though, number 10, Undefined.  Oh, no.  Nine, a song called Yeah.  Number eight is Bad Day.  Yeah.  This is very telling, the last 10 songs played.  Number eight is Bad Day.  Number seven is My Love. 
[00:50:00]  Number six, last 10 songs played.  It Ends Tonight by the All-American Rejects.  Dude, it gets way better.  Number five, Don't Funk With My Heart.  Number four, I swear to God, Showstopper.  Yes, that it was.  By what, Danny, what is it?  Carter and Festa.  Kane.  Can't get enough of them.  Number three, Wait a Minute by the Pussycat Dolls. 
[00:50:30]  Last 10 songs played.  Number two, Fighter by Christina Aguilera.  And the last song played on 107.9, the end, a song called How to Save a Life by the Fray.  Wow.  About Dead Woman Over Troubled Water.  Can you believe that?  It's right on their website.  You might want to, like, maybe take that one off the playlist for a while.  Yeah, maybe take that out of heavy rotation for a little while.  You know why?  Because it's all computerized anyway. 
[00:51:00]  We know how this stuff works.  Yeah.  They don't program music by a program director sitting there going through tunes.  It's all done.  They throw them all, all the songs, into a computer, and it spits it out in a certain order.  And that shows it right there.  Where's Drowning Pool?  Put some Drowning Pool in there.  Yeah, there you go.  Wow.  All right.  Here we go.  We're sending you down to Starbucks.  We're going to talk to Rich Voss from a Starbucks after the break.  We're going to get some comments about your fag bag.  Like, mm-hmm, that's nice. 
[00:51:30]  Little gold zippers on the little.  What do you put in the little end compartments?  Because there's so much room in the middle.  Why would you need the little end compartments?  You know what that's for?  Makeup.  Makeup goes there.  And then on the other side, you know how girls like to compartmentalize their goodies and things?  That's why there's so many little nooks and crannies in their purses and zip-up compartments and stuff.  That compartment is for your little cute cell phone.  Maybe like a cherry red type cell phone. 
[00:52:00]  And maybe some lip gloss.  And then you've got to have, like Jimmy brought up before, tampons have to be put in there somewhere.  You know, listen to me.  Condoms if you're a whore.  Are you a whore, Rich?  High-class prostitute bag.  Yeah, that's what it is.  His blonde wig.  Hi, Daddy.  All right.  We really got to take a break.  We're having a lot of fun.  What do you got there, Stan? 
[00:52:30]  Anything good?  Tim just gave us some Carter and Fester.  What their involvement was.  Oh, nice.  They turned on the spigot.  You have an update on Voss's.  All right.  We got so much going on.  We got an update.  All right.  Why don't you do that fast?  Iraq, you have an update on Voss's bag.  We went to the website.  His bag is not on the website, but the pattern and style is listed under women's, city bags, and briefcases.  All right.  Women's, city bags, and briefcases.  Women's.  Jesus. 
[00:53:00]  Where is it?  I think he's wrong.  How could it be wrong?  They all look like your bag without a few side saddle things.  Yeah.  It's very close to your bag.  The side saddle things make them even more womanly.  Yes.  That's, it's a chick's bag.  It's a chick's bag, Rich.  We're going to find out at Starbucks, all right?  Let me see it, Rich.  Can you bring it over here, please?  Thank you.  And what do you got on Carter and Fester, Ann?  Because we've got to take a break.  We're late here.  It just says, personalities, Carter and Fester came in and out of the room pumping up the participants. 
[00:53:30]  And what they would do is, we did it like they were drinking shots.  Instead of saying cheers, we would say, we, and then shoot down the water.  Ew.  Oh, my God.  They don't even know how to kill a listener, right?  Fester, I know.  They're even hacky when it comes to murder.  Fester went outside and sprayed the window with water and turned on a faucet to tempt contestants to use the bathroom.  So why is he fired for that?  That was helping the contestants along. 
[00:54:00]  Dude, any involvement in it.  If you were in the building, you got thrown out, apparently.  Poor Carter and Fester.  They weren't doing anything.  We've got to start a website.  Save Carter and Fester.  Save Carter and Fester, whoever they are.  They're collateral damage is what it comes down to.  Any pics of them?  Yeah, here you go.  He's got one of those big goatees that, without the mustache.  The radio, he looks like a radio guy.  All right.  He looks like Rocco, dude.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that's Fester. 
[00:54:30]  All right, listen, listen.  Poor Fester.  We could easily keep going, but we're going to get in serious trouble and we're going to be really late.  So when we get back, we'll be talking to Rich Voss from Starbucks.  All right.  Oh, and don't forget, sometime this morning, this.  Nothing you have ever seen before and nothing you have ever heard before will prepare you for the shot of...  My baby is black. 
[00:55:00]  And it's in Rich Voss's bag.  Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, bold story never before told on the screen.  There you go.  My baby is the presidential candidate.  Wow.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Now, we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow stickers are your tickets to a successful Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow stickers have many other uses?  I sliced out both my kidneys and I patched up the wounds with Wow stickers. 
[00:55:30]  But, but, dude, how do you pee?  Oh, boy.  Can't pee.  This was incredibly nearsighted.  It's Opie and Anthony!  Can't go pee.  Can't go pee.  Can't go pee.  Can't go pee.  Pee.  Dance.  Pee.  Dance.  Gotta go pee.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Yeah, how to save a life. 
[00:56:00]  Oh.  How do we save Carter and Fester?  We're obsessed with Carter and Fester this morning.  Carter and Fester were also let go.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Now I'm not sure if I like my new chair.  See?  Are you seeing the problem I had with it?  I kind of like it.  Initially, it feels like a good chair.  And then it's crap. 
[00:56:30]  I've had that chair since we started working here.  And it pushes you off of the front of it.  There's not enough room between the front of the chair where your legs hang over and the back where your back hits.  And yes, all chairs are adjustable.  I know.  I've adjusted it completely out.  But it's still...  You slowly kind of fall off the front of it.  And it pulls...  It gives you a wedgie.  I've left the studio with my...  How do you say it? 
[00:57:00]  With a wedgie.  With a wedgie.  Both hands.  Yank it back out.  Yeah.  And you've got to like...  Not even a wedgie like that.  Like, I've left in pain.  Like I had entered into some type of sexual situation with a girl.  And not been able to finish the job.  And then you leave.  And you get...  You know, something starts with blue.  And ends with everything everybody knows.  Except you can't say.  Christ. 
[00:57:30]  Stupid rules.  Gotta keep it safe for the kids.  Stupid effing rules.  Don't worry, Al.  We're keeping it safe for the kids.  Yeah, Al.  You didn't have to dump out, Al.  But yeah.  All safe and sound.  Because you'll notice.  You will slowly start being pushed off of that chair.  There's not enough room...  Yeah.  ...for somebody to sit there.  It's a chick chair.  Really fast.  Because we got Rich Voss at Starbucks.  Yeah.  We changed chairs in studio.  And it turns out the chair Anthony hates, I love, and vice versa. 
[00:58:00]  And Jimmy's just looking at us like, holy crap.  They're switching chairs on the break.  It's just...  Well, they had to bring in a new chair for me, even.  Like, Opie offered me his chair.  I was going to take that.  And I looked at it like, yeah, that looks like it's got enough room.  And then they wheeled in this wonderful aircraft carrier-sized chair for me.  This is a fine radio show.  And I'm sure a lot of the listeners are...  They wonder, except for the pal talkers, because we do during the breaks.  They're sitting there wondering, God, they must really work their asses off when the commercials  are playing, trying to figure out what they're going to do next with their program. 
[00:58:30]  No, we're just talking about chairs.  We need a better chair.  But you initially loved his old chair.  You're like, ah, it's good for my back.  It's nice and firm.  And then 30 seconds later, I don't know if I like this chair.  I don't like this chair.  Fuss budget.  We're out of our minds.  We really are.  Fuss budget.  Oh, all right.  So getting wedgies and stuff.  Just a quick question, okay?  And you've got to be honest.  All right.  Have you ever had to leave your underwear behind because you pretty much destroyed them? 
[00:59:00]  In the course of my life?  They were in bad shape.  Of course.  They were unfixable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the course of, I think, every guy's life, there comes a time where you have to jettison  the underwear.  Just leave them behind.  Yeah.  Like, I've done it in a Starbucks bathroom.  Oh.  And all of a sudden, I'm like, oh boy, there's a problem here.  I've got to just jettison these things.  Yeah.  Jimmy's got to go. 
[00:59:30]  Recently, actually.  No, no, no.  Oh, really?  Recently?  Yeah.  It was just like I was carrying a pudding slingshot.  Oh, jeez.  I absolutely know what you're talking about.  And where did you jettison it?  It was actually home.  Oh, at home?  That was kind of like, you know, the greatest is when you're like.  Oh, out?  That's what I mean.  You're out and about.  You've got to do what you've got to do.  And all of a sudden, you're like, oh boy, there's a problem here. 
[01:00:00]  I've got to jettison these things.  No, not out.  There have been days like when I used to do actual manual labor.  And I would go home and, you know, maybe it was a rough night, the night before, out drinking.  And then you have to use the bathroom during the day and then back up into a hot attic.  And, you know, this is some nice insulation going on and everything else.  It's just the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald back there.  They can write a song about it. 
[01:00:30]  It was horrid.  Our old pal, Crazy Jim, told the greatest story as far as jettisoning your underpants.  He had to get rid of his, yeah.  Let's just put it this way.  He had to do what he had to do.  And then there was nothing to take.  Nothing to clean up with.  Nothing to clean up after.  Do that act.  Right.  So then he had to use, yes, he had to use that. 
[01:01:00]  And then he realized, well, wow.  So then he put his underpants in the drop ceiling of the bathroom he was in at the time.  I think it was a McDonald's.  A McDonald's bathroom.  Bathroom.  In the drop ceiling.  And he just opened up the drop ceiling and threw his filthy underwear up into the ceiling.  It was so horrific.  He didn't want to just leave them in the wastebasket.  He said, man, I got to hide these things.  I got to bury it.  Because he had to use it.  I got to bury this.  I, I, and to be completely honest, again, I, I've never used my underwear for that. 
[01:01:30]  But I have used a sock.  Wow.  I figured I'd sacrifice the sock.  You look like a really bad puppet act.  Oh, no.  What are you doing to me?  I stink.  I actually, by the way, yes, I did have to use them one time when I was younger.  Me and my friend Paul were walking to steal comic books one time.  Of course.  And I had like one of those like, oh, my God, I can't walk. 
[01:02:00]  And we had to run into the woods real quick.  I had to.  And as I was finishing up, there were yellow jackets circling my legs.  Because apparently I was by a beehive.  And I'll never forget like three yellow jackets whizzing in and out between my legs.  Wow.  That's scary.  It was awful.  And I had on, I had to, I had to leave my underwear there because there was nothing.  I wasn't going to chance any leaves.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got to leave them behind, man.  Yep.  Leave them behind.  I was hoping he was going to tell us he used the beehive to clean up. 
[01:02:30]  An old wasp vest.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve.  He's with Rich Voss.  He's at Starbucks downstairs.  What's up, Steve?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  We're in the middle of Starbucks.  Okay.  Rich has convinced me to purchase the same bag.  And as a matter of fact, there's a lot of people down here with various styles of purses and  bags and briefcases.  So I'm hoping we'll get a nice, a smattering of different views.  Is Rich getting recognized? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  A cop just walked in and said, yeah, you're the guy with the mo bag.  Oh, really?  The mo bag.  It's good to know they're listening out there.  All right.  So how are we going to do this, Steve?  You got a game plan?  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  We're live on the radio.  And we're just asking a couple questions about this bag that this gentleman is holding.  Would you mind?  Would you mind talking to us for a few minutes?  I don't know.  Okay.  If there was somebody in your family that you were going to buy that Louis Vuitton bag 
[01:03:30]  for, who would it be?  That would probably be for my mother or sister-in-law of the female persuasion.  A mother or sister-in-law of the female persuasion.  Steve, you did not coach her, right?  No, not at all.  Okay.  Let's move on.  This is so obvious.  Make sure Rich is just holding the bag.  Don't have him modeling it or wearing it.  Not modeling it.  All right.  He's not modeling it at all.  All right.  Move on, Steve.  So far, one. 
[01:04:00]  She said mother and sister-in-law.  Then stress female.  One says mother and sister-in-law.  Endor.  We're live on the radio.  Would you mind answering a few questions about...  Take these things.  All right.  Okay.  One guy not interested.  Oh.  Let's ask...  How that douchebag?  Just lighten up and do it, you stupid goddamn...  What is wrong with people?  I'm so busy.  Everyone thinks they're so important.  Just do it.  Throw burning coffee in his face. 
[01:04:30]  A scalding cup on his neck.  Okay.  Do a little oopsie as you're getting the milk and the sugar.  All right.  You there?  Yes, Steve.  Okay.  I'm here with a gentleman now.  Sir, if you were going to buy this Louis Vuitton bag for somebody in your family, who would  you buy it for?  For my wife.  For your wife.  All right.  See?  I don't know.  My wife would love that bag.  I mean, it wouldn't be for me, but it would definitely be for my wife.  She would love that bag.  Yeah, okay.  There you have it.  The wife would love it. 
[01:05:00]  Thank you.  All right.  Wait.  Rich is now arguing.  Hold on.  Don't let Rich argue with anybody.  Shut up.  Yeah, because we don't want people to realize that it's his bag.  Right.  Exactly.  Okay.  All right.  Keep going.  We'll do two more.  Yeah.  Oh.  Which radio?  We got that.  Oh.  All right.  And we're being ejected.  Are you kidding?  Starbucks.  Are you kidding?  For what?  For what?  Who's rejecting you? 
[01:05:30]  A manager.  For what?  What are they saying?  Because we're being a nuisance, apparently.  Wow.  Because important things are getting done at Starbucks.  Unbelievable.  God, this country stinks on ice.  No one wants to have fun anymore.  No, they certainly don't.  What kind of nuisance could we be?  You're online for a lousy cup of coffee.  That's overpriced.  Maybe they recognize Voss as having done stand-up.  Just one question about this.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  I got another.  Another woman.  Okay.  We're live on the radio.  We're asking you.  If you were going to buy this Louis Vuitton bag for somebody in your family, who would  it be for?  My sister.  Your sister?  Sister.  That's it?  Very good.  Very good.  Thank you very much.  See?  Not one man.  That's it.  Everybody would buy this Louis Vuitton bag for a woman in their family.  It's so obvious.  This one is so obvious.  You want to talk to Rich? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  He's now arguing his point.  Hold on a second.  All right.  Rich?  Here it is.  Of course, they're all going to say women when he asked all women.  They asked a guy.  They asked a guy.  He said he would buy it for his wife.  His wife.  You don't.  Oh, you're right.  Oh, you're right.  Okay.  So they asked one guy and two.  Ask this lady.  Miss.  Miss.  Do you like this?  Oh, you creep.  This isn't working out for me right now.  No.  Yeah.  Work them on the street, Rich.  Ask some people.  I will ask people.  Here comes a lady right here. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  Let's go.  Excuse me, Miss.  See this bag right here?  Would you buy this for a male or a female?  You're sorry?  Okay, it's an answer.  It's a yes or no.  A male or a female?  A bag.  She's looking at it.  Okay, this lady.  This lady has a mink.  She has class.  Who would you buy this bag for, ma'am?  A male or a female?  This Louis Vuitton?  Female.  A female?  Female.  But a male couldn't have it?  Like he did a first time.  Don't.  Don't.  He hit her with it. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  That's a nice mink.  That's a nice mink.  All right.  That's another female.  You want to buy one of those too, Rich?  Why don't you just ask a little bit more jaded?  Who would you buy this for?  A female or a male?  A male.  Or a male.  Wink, wink.  Help me out.  You know he's making his dumb bug eyes at her too.  Yeah.  Or a male.  Come on.  Or a male, right?  Listen, this is how.  This is what a man I am.  When I'm wrong, I can admit I'm wrong.  I might be wrong in this situation.  The problem might be.  The problem is you can't admit that you're gay. 
[01:08:00]  I can't hear this.  I think they're having humor on my behalf again.  Humor on my behalf.  It's not expensive.  Hey, you guys.  Would you guys.  These are tough guys.  Would you guys carry this Louis Vuitton bag to carry it?  Would you guys carry this?  No.  No.  Sounds like he's asking them to carry it for him.  Excuse me.  Would you guys carry this for me?  Through the airport security?  Yeah.  You can't ask a question.  There's a Spanish guy that looked at me in such disgust. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, of course.  I wouldn't carry that.  This is not even close.  Yes, Rich.  What's that?  This one's not even close.  All right.  Hold on.  Well, we're coming upstairs here.  You know, there's a.  All right.  There you go.  He's coming back upstairs.  Not one person said they would buy that for a guy and their family or friends or anything.  It's all women.  All right.  And the photos are up on opianthony.com.  We're going to catch up a little bit.  We'll continue. 
[01:09:00]  We got some idle talk.  We got my baby is black.  We got to save Brad Pitt.  We got to wish Muhammad Ali a very happy 65th birthday today.  And Jason Itzler had a problem in jail.  And Jason Itzler, who called the show yesterday.  We couldn't get to him.  We'll get into that story as well.  It's the Opian Anthony show.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Let's give it the big plug here.  Right.  Get a wow on the vehicle.  For detailed instructions on how to get your very own wow sticker, visit opianthony.com.  Wow stands for whip him out Wednesday.  We pretty much say at this point, whip him out whenever. 
[01:09:30]  It's going to be whip him out any time, but that's a wow.  It works great when you're stuck in traffic going to a sporting event.  Wow.  One of these days you'd be driving, a girl that's familiar with the program is going to see the wow,  know what it means, pull up next to you, and flash you.  It makes that commute so much better.  So there you have it.  Whip him out Wednesday.  It's the Opian Anthony show.  The Opian Anthony virus.  All right, we're back with the Opian Anthony show. 
[01:10:00]  Who saw American Idol last night?  A lot of people.  A lot of people tend to watch that program.  It's the goof portion of the show, really.  Yeah, where they showcase all the people with no talent.  Pretty much.  They show a few of the good singers and let them through, but mostly focusing on the freak show aspect.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  And they make believe they're not seeing freak shows, by the way.  That's what I hate about the show.  It's not really honest.  Like, those people are in there to be goofed on.  Yeah.  But the judges make believe, like, what?  What are you doing here?  How did this person slip through?  They already know they're going to be watching some really, really bad singers.  Yeah.  That's what it's all about.  And then they have this new gag, which I think is hilarious.  is where all the contestants, after they get beat up, they're walking out and they're 
[01:11:00]  going through the left side of the two doors.  Yeah, there's double doors.  And for some reason, they're keeping the left side locked and the right side open just so  they can, like, beat them up just one more time on the way out.  So when they leave, all dejected, they hit the door on the left door and it's locked.  And then they have to go, other door.  Other door.  Other door.  Like, stupid.  You can't even get that right.  I was like, yeah, yeah.  I'll show you guys.  The American Idol just made the biggest mistake ever by not having me on. 
[01:11:30]  I would have made the show the best ever.  But you'll find, and then they look into the camera and say stuff like, you know, you'll  see, I'm going to make it without you.  Where are those people?  Like, from all the other seasons.  They say that every year.  Yep.  Well, Linda Stassi, who Jimmy hates in general.  With a passion.  She's a TV critic, I guess.  Yeah.  American tragedy, she writes in the New York Post today.  Couldn't find anything that rhymed with idol. 
[01:12:00]  Idol opener.  Yeah, really.  Idol opener, a crying shame.  Ah.  What a disappointment.  American Idol was, for the most part, sad and painful, and it was like laughing at the  handicapped.  What?  That's why I found it hilarious last night.  Exactly.  Uh, I filled my-  One of our favorite pastimes.  She writes, I filled my living room with my biggest idol fanatics, and we breathlessly  anticipated the return of everyone's favorite talent show. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, did she have a little party?  You know what a hen fest that must have been?  Oh.  Checks party mix all over the place.  Arms and cheese and nibbling on it.  What was that?  You went on mic.  I couldn't hear you.  I did not hear you either.  Was he whispering another secret?  I know.  I said a funny line.  What'd you say?  I said, the fat lady, they were dipping almond cheese and nibbling on it at the party.  No, come on. 
[01:13:00]  No, actually, that's pretty funny.  Anyway, it gets better, so-  That's funny.  Damn you.  By the end of the night, there wasn't a dry eye or a happy face in the crowd.  Good thing I had brownies.  Ew.  None of them have spouses.  God.  Is that what cheers you up?  A bunch of people are being rejected, and you shove a few brownies in your fat face, and  all is well at the world?  Everything's fine.  How superficial are you?  Don't worry, people.  Oh, brownies.  I got brownies.  Right.  Don't worry. 
[01:13:30]  Bunch of crying little hens.  Oh, this is terrible.  They're treating me.  Ooh.  I feel my fat face.  And then this is what she writes.  Look, it's one thing to laugh at, yes, at, the talentless yet hopelessly arrogant.  It's another thing to laugh at hopefuls who are just hopelessly sad.  The show began with an endless cry fest from a girl named Jessica, who was so bad and so  sad and so hopeful that she was heartbreaking. 
[01:14:00]  Don't you understand the whole gist of the show from the beginning has been American people's  fascination with watching other people's dreams be crushed?  To see that moment.  We enjoy that as a people.  I don't know why.  It's just human nature.  And I find it hilarious to look at how clueless some of these people are.  That they think they're talented and they're so bad that they can't even tell.  They have no clue how bad they are. 
[01:14:30]  Because mommy told them how great they were their entire lives.  My thing, in a weird way, as much as I don't like her at all, I kind of, I agree a little  bit with her.  The brownies?  Yes, they are delicious.  And I get a bunch of my favorite friends over and we all held rich Voss bags in Washington  American Island.  My problem with the show...  Your brownies walked in, though.  Throw them on my chest.  My problem with the show is always like, I was like, eh, they're kind of attacking weak  targets.  Like, Simon, I kind of do like them.  I think he's funny. 
[01:15:00]  But I was always like, they're not doing it with guys in Compton.  Like, they're always just attacking these soft, weak people who are just really depressed.  Not the arrogant ones are one thing, but the ones that are sad, I actually feel bad  for.  I'm a faggot.  I think that's who's showing up, though, are people that actually have talent and then  these retarded people.  They really are the retarded.  And it's a program that lets us laugh at the retarded.  I love it.  But Jimmy makes a great point.  It's not like, you know, it's young rap hopefuls. 
[01:15:30]  Simon wouldn't be as brave.  And there's another thing I noticed.  There's obviously a lot of security guys off camera right to their right.  Because I see them look over to the right every once in a while.  Because I'm wondering why no one has really went after them physically.  After some of the stuff that are said, I'm like, wow, they really show a lot of restraint.  I would be in their faces.  But there's obviously some muscle right to the right protecting Paula and Randy and Simon.  Well, rap people don't show.  They show up late. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, rap people.  They're not going to get there on time anyhow.  And then Tom was the audition.  And then Linda continues.  Damn, that's early.  The show began.  Oh, we did that part.  The rest of the night was just as sad with contestants breaking down in real tears of despair.  Hello, that's entertainment.  Did she write hello?  Yeah.  Or was that you saying that?  Hello with a big exclamation point.  Hello.  Hello.  That's entertainment.  I hate the hello.  Why not take us to the real dog pound and watch the dogs get ready for our euthanasia?  All right.  That would be a great show. 
[01:16:30]  Let's go to the little shelter in East Northport.  Let's find Marge.  Where's Marge?  And then she writes, I'm surprised a blind nun didn't show up to sing Over the Rainbow.  What?  Whatever.  What was that supposed to mean?  Well, the line before that was that the people, I mean, they showed up in their uniforms.  All the military people that showed up in...  Oh, right.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  She was saying that it was kind of manipulative, but...  I think it is a little bit on the contestants' part.  I don't think the show or the staff has anything to do with that, but I think when somebody comes in and they're in the military and they're dressed in uniform, they're trying to garner some sympathy from the American people. 
[01:17:00]  Sure.  That they're soldiers.  That one guy that was from the aircraft carrier, Ronald Reagan.  Yeah.  He was bald.  And it wasn't even like...  Who was the guy last year?  The rocker guy?  Chris Daughtry.  Yeah.  Chris Daughtry where he shaved his head to look like the guy from Live.  This guy, like, had the horseshoe ring baldness.  Right.  And he's supposed to be an American idol? 
[01:17:30]  Now they're going with a sob story like...  The guy had the Murray Slaughter cut.  Your hair looks great, Murr.  You're going to be an American idol.  Okay, Murr.  We're behind you all the way, Murr.  Lou, vote Lou.  Vote for Murr.  This has got the skinhead and the horseshoe hair.  Right.  And he's up there, you know, singing, belting it out.  And that's a great look if you're a plumber, but not if you're an American idol. 
[01:18:00]  For American Idol.  Right.  The words Murray Slaughter will always make me laugh.  Murray Slaughter.  So what do you think?  We're all behind you, Murr.  I love that.  They're coming in with sob stories now.  The one girl, I was a crack baby.  Yeah, yeah.  They all have their stories.  And she looks like she's on crack herself.  Yeah.  She's 16, but she looks like she's 30 already.  She looked a mess.  Yeah, she's 16.  And you looked and went, wow, that crack baby stuff. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, that'll damage you a little bit.  That'll damage the DNA.  You want to talk about depression from the show?  I played golf with Brian Dunkelman, who was the co-host from the first season that quit.  Whoa.  I thought they fired him.  He said he quit.  But all I know is I'm playing for his golf, and the guy's in a beaten down, broken Mercedes in L.A.  Wait, what's the story?  I don't know it.  Yeah, was he one of three or was it four?  No, he was the co-host with Ryan Seacrest.  Yeah, there was Ryan Seacrest and then this other guy.  Yeah, Brian Dunkelman. 
[01:19:00]  I play golf with him.  And you know the guy.  Yeah, I play golf with him.  And you're saying he quit the show.  He did not quit that show.  Would you have a threesome with Pete Best also as he was teeing off behind you?  What happened is he thought, you know, he wanted to do his comedy lines.  And, you know, they would write him lines.  And he said they're not funny enough.  And he wouldn't want to do it.  And he didn't get along with anybody.  And he goes, he said he quit.  Oh, he did not quit the American Idol.  How do you lose the American Idol gig?  Now I think he's doing Jeopardy in Atlantic City, like a live Jeopardy show. 
[01:19:30]  That's how you say face.  You get to tell your friends, yeah, I quit.  I walked away from that.  I have dignity.  I'm not going to kowtow to a show.  Fired.  Oh, my God, I was fired.  I was fired.  The biggest show in history.  What's his name?  Brian Dunkelman.  Exactly.  Maybe they fired him because there's a name like Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkelman.  Dunkelman.  It's not a sharpest name.  Dunkelman.  It doesn't flow off the tongue.  American Idol with Brian Dunkelman.  Change that name.  Right.  Yeah, Ryan Seacrest, Hollywood-type name. 
[01:20:00]  Yes.  And Dunkelman.  I believe the Dunkelmans are coming over tonight.  Are they coming tonight, the Dunkelmans?  We always invite the Dunkelmans and they never show.  Oy vey.  Dunkelman.  That's an uncomfortable name.  Ryan Seacrest and Fred Klott.  Yeah.  That should be his first step. 
[01:20:30]  Change the name.  Just change the name.  You want to hear Jessica perform?  Dunkelman party.  You're ready to tee off the Dunkelmans?  Dunkelman.  Why are you attacking me for his name?  I don't know.  You're friends with him.  Yeah.  There are two types of people that watch American Idol.  When someone like Jessica starts breaking down and crying because her dream is crushed, I just can't control myself.  Belly laugh.  Laughing.  Laughing my ass off.  I think it's some of the greatest TV you could ever watch. 
[01:21:00]  It's somebody's dreams being crushed, but it's also the fact that they were so confident that that wasn't going to happen.  Yeah.  It's watching somebody's stupidity that you think you're going to walk in.  And this was her moment.  Like, she had this, we talked about this last season, plotted out in her head.  Probably as she went to sleep at night for weeks, she was picturing, like, and here it is, the final two, and the winner of this year's American Idol is, and calling her name. 
[01:21:30]  And she walks in there, fully expecting, you're going to Hollywood, dog.  You know why they're.  And boom, gets thrown out.  You know why she's fully expecting?  They did a whole featured piece on her, showing her at the mall.  A little expose.  She's like.  Usually those people make it.  She does, what, makeovers?  Yeah.  In the Mall of America.  So they had the camera crew following her around for a day.  Yeah.  So she's thinking, I obviously am going to Hollywood.  I'm in.  But that was just to make it hurt a little more when they tell her, no, you're not going. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  They wanted people to hurt for her.  They wanted you to have an investment in her.  Right.  So you hurt.  Well, there's three.  Actually, now there's three types of people.  You see someone's dream get crushed on TV.  You're openly laughing.  I think it's the funniest thing ever.  Then, like Jimmy said, you got someone that sympathizes with the person, like, oh, my God,  this is so sad.  And you may even have watery eyes at home.  And then there's the third person that it's just so cringy.  You want to watch, but you're watching through your hands. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Like, my girlfriend's squeezing my arm, like, oh, my God, uncomfortable moment.  She could barely watch.  And I'm sitting there, like, ah.  Just laughing.  Right.  So what kind of person are you?  Here's Jessica.  Does it make you laugh?  Does it make you feel bad for her?  Or are you just cringing like it's like a car wreck?  You kind of want to see it, kind of not want to see it?  Yeah.  You got the clicker in your hand, like, I got to change the channel.  The clicker, Grandpa?  I know.  The remote.  My grandfather used to have the clicker when he would watch the Mets games on Channel 9. 
[01:23:00]  Just a rabbit ear.  Just the aerial.  With rusty stomp.  Yeah, or you got the remote in your hand, and you're so close to changing the channel,  but you just can't.  There's something there you got to keep watching, and you don't know why.  I feel sad for people, man.  Do you really?  Not the ones that are asses, like, and they're the ones that expect to be idols.  Like, they're boobs.  Yeah.  But there are people that just don't have anything.  I kind of empathize as a guy who does it for a living. 
[01:23:30]  It's like, man, I know how much it means to me, and it's like, I really feel like,  if that's all you hold on to, like, you're dumb little, you think you're a good singer,  you're mediocre.  It's like, just to see that, just to see you humiliated kind of bothers me.  But here's the deal.  When you first started comedy.  Don't point at me, Rich.  I know you can't see him anyhow.  Now, when you first started comedy, these people have been doing it two or three years,  and they expect to be stars without working out.  You know, some of these that say you can't get on the show with training and whatever,  they still can maybe follow their dream. 
[01:24:00]  You know, how many comics in two years can get on TV and go, I'm an idol?  You know what I mean?  So you're feeling sorry for people that are not in the position to feel sorry for.  Here's the difference.  Here's the difference.  Comedy is something you have to work out in front of people.  You don't do comedy in your shower.  You can't do comedy when you're alone and get better at it.  You can't sing alone.  You can't.  People have natural.  You know what I mean?  It's a different singing vibe.  Just to see them just ripped apart.  Like, whatever.  It's funny.  But it does bother me.  It's like, ugh.  Really?  After the rest of your life, you're going to know, like, you were really embarrassed.  Like, you're not good. 
[01:24:30]  Like, that little private thing that you loved about yourself, you're not good at.  Yeah, but you can't be trained to be a good comic.  You can be trained to be a good singer.  Of course you can be trained to be a good comic.  Not really.  On stage, it's good training.  Of course it is.  All right.  Why don't we play Jessica and see what kind of person you are?  I just openly laugh.  I see that they're emotionally unstable, and that just makes me just laugh my ass off.  It really does.  And then there's the mom supporting their stupid dream that they don't have a chance at. 
[01:25:00]  No.  Here's Jessica singing a Jewel song in front of Jewel.  I hear the clock at 6 a.m.  I feel so far from where I've been.  I got my eggs, I got all my pancakes, too.  I got maple syrup, everything but you.  I break the oak to make a smiley face.  I kind of like it in my brand new place.  I wipe the spots, move me, leave the keys, and the doll, and never throw a towel on the floor anymore, 
[01:25:30]  cause James laughs for so long.  Even after you go on, then I know.  Thank you.  She completely believes that she's really, really good.  Yeah.  She thought she sounded just like Jewel.  Right.  Jewel's sitting there.  It's one of her heroes.  No clue how awful she really is.  Scratch what I said.  She should be shot.  She could sing as she's pushing the cleaning cart from one room to another. 
[01:26:00]  Well, this is what happened to poor Jessica.  Like listening to the record, wasn't it?  No.  Yeah.  That was funny.  Yeah, Simon just nailed her.  He is by far my favorite.  That's funny.  Love Simon.  His facial expressions last night.  Oh, yeah.  Priceless.  And Paul Abdul, they obviously edited all around her.  She was barely part of the show last night.  Yeah, because, well, based on that interview she gave, wow. 
[01:26:30]  There's something going on with her.  She seems to be honest.  You know, Rich, you've been through some times in your life when your addictions, you might  have done a drug or two.  She drank so much, Fester got fired again.  Poor Fester.  She was so drunk.  Say Carter.  Don't goof on Fester.  Yeah, come on.  Carter's part of it.  You talked about the interview that she did on her in the morning.  It was so bad.  All right, here we go.  It's like listening to the record, wasn't it?  No, Simon, stop it.  Stop it. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, you're snag.  Jewel, did that sound like you?  I don't want to talk right now.  I don't think you sounded like Jewel.  I think you sounded like Jessica.  I wasn't trying to sound like her.  Yeah.  I was just trying to put my own little part into it.  And that you did.  You definitely did that.  Right, Randy, yes or no?  No, the singing, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Okay, Jewel?  It's going to take a little work.  Keep it up.  No.  Hold up.  I'm going to have to pass. 
[01:27:30]  Are you kidding me?  No, please.  Jessica, I've got to be on.  Here we go.  Tell me what I'm going to work on and I'll try something else.  Jessica, we'll take an hour.  No way.  In your case, honest to God, you're so far off.  No, no.  No way.  I'm kidding, please.  It's not good, dude.  No, hold me.  I won't be ignored.  She's like the stalker psycho broad.  Won't be ignored.  I won't be ignored, Dan.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly. 
[01:28:00]  She's got that in her voice like she's going to turn completely psycho.  Yeah.  It's not good, dude.  No, hold me.  It's not good.  No, Jessica, sweetheart, I don't want to patronize you.  This is never going to work for you, darling.  It kind of sounds like an uncle's walking in a room.  I mean, we're sorry, but it's, we're trying to find the best.  That was so far and away from it.  I'm sorry.  There's other things to be great at.  You don't have to be a singer. 
[01:28:30]  Hold on.  No.  And the good news today is you found out that you're not going to be.  So you can just move on.  Thank you, Sarah.  Thanks, Grace, sweetheart.  Thank you.  No.  No.  Oh, baby.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, no, no.  Don't be sorry.  I can't believe it.  You did your best.  Okay, babe.  You did your best.  You can hear the mom getting fatter, by the way.  You can hear the mom getting fatter. 
[01:29:00]  You did your best.  You did your best.  You did your best.  You did your best.  That's my girl.  You did your best.  Okay, babe.  You did your best.  No.  Wow.  There's next year, baby.  Come on.  I thought I had it.  I really did.  I thought I had it.  I thought I was ready.  Jesus.  I thought I'm not even a good singer.  In the bedroom, you're supposed to go to a foster home. 
[01:29:30]  Jesus.  That's the type of crying that happens right before the rape kit comes out.  I know.  Jesus, there should be a doll there.  Oh, my God.  Jeez, man.  I know I'm damaged goods because I find nothing funnier in this world than that moment.  I was just losing it.  She had played it out.  Jewel was there. 
[01:30:00]  One of our heroes, our idols, she played it out in her head.  And they built her up to fail miserably.  That's why the people behind American Idol, they're sick.  They're sick people.  They know they have to step it up and top themselves every year.  They are sick.  So they did the expose on her, which probably led her to believe she was going to be chosen.  Yeah.  And then they let her down real hard right in front of her idol who's sitting right there. 
[01:30:30]  It's not coincidence that they picked Jewel to be there after finding out Jewel was this girl's idol.  Jewel, and they set the whole thing up, the expose, put her in front of them.  She sings.  She's awful.  They hammered her.  Yeah.  What do they expect?  Yeah.  She broke down like, whoa.  It was awful to listen to.  Is she awful as she can never be a singer?  Because I don't have real good ears.  Yeah, she's very bad.  Wow.  She's trying to do an imitation of Jewel.  And it's just coming off as this affected, over-enunciating, the affectation of Jewel on a lot of the words. 
[01:31:00]  It's horrible.  Let's go to Tom in Maine.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, I watched that show last night, and it was just so awkward, that moment.  I mean, she's singing in front of Jewel.  She's trying to sound like Jewel.  It was almost as bad as the Shakira girl singing like Shakira.  Okay, but the only thing, the Shakira girl was really hot. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  They just wanted some hotness in Hollywood.  That's what that was all about.  But, Tom, you're saying on the phone that you had to watch through your hands?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm laughing my ass off, but at the same time, I'm so embarrassed that I'm watching through my fingers.  Yeah, people get embarrassed when they have to hold on to somebody or hide their face.  I swear to God, I open my eyes so wide and turn up the volume.  Oh, just watch it.  I want to take it all in.  Revel in it.  I want to enjoy it all.  I had to bail on that audio.  I could not listen to it.  That was truly uncomfortable.  Yeah? 
[01:32:00]  I could not listen to it.  That is such a surprise coming from me.  I could not listen to it.  Well, let's continue because I can.  This is just unreal.  Like, I'm like trying to wait for it.  I'm like, come on, you're going to be like, psych.  Oh, my goodness.  I guess that's it.  But thank you very much.  Thank you.  Bye for porno.  You know, I gave it my all and I did my best and I guess that's all I can say. 
[01:32:30]  I got to go now.  Jimmy doesn't mind that crying when he pays money and they're leaving his apartment.  And that crying's fun.  I'm not a humanitarian.  I just, I can't listen to that audio.  Really?  It's truly uncomfortable.  What is it about it?  Just sad.  It's sad.  The funniest thing is how Opie really enjoys this.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  I know I'm damaged.  Trust me.  You can see the front of his jeans right now.  It's unbelievable that somebody can get off. 
[01:33:00]  I know I'm damaged.  Trust me, I know that.  I got this weird black comedy thing in my head.  I mean, when the girl forgot the words, that was hilarious because she really kept going.  Yeah.  You got her?  She was funny just because she was, yeah, just such a dope.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're going in there and you don't even know the words to the song you're supposed  to be singing.  This girl went from her major dreams to a cutter now.  Oh, yeah.  Now, she was already a cutter, though.  You got to understand that.  The girl is emotionally unstable to begin with. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  She's already cutting.  This is just going to take it to the next level.  I'm not saying they shouldn't be honest.  I'm not saying they should put her through because she stunk.  I just, the finality of it makes me sad for her.  Yeah.  It's over.  Just tell her, no, you're not right for this show.  You know what, though?  I wanted to be a goddamn astronaut.  All right?  And that wasn't going to happen.  No, you make too much money now.  What did you do is tell her to cut off? 
[01:34:00]  Actually, you know what?  He makes a good point.  You can still be an astronaut.  You make enough money, then you might be one of these guys that gets to go up in the  space shop.  I don't want it to be old school astronaut, you know?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Not like the guys that buy their way in.  That's not an astronaut.  That's a frigging passenger on a death plight.  Good point.  Good point.  You tell a girl like this to cut off her arm and leg and she can win last comic five.  That's what she goes to.  I didn't get it at first.  I was just like, all right. 
[01:34:30]  Steven asked from Bayshore on the Instant Feedback.  Hey, Opie, who will save your soul?  The answer, nobody.  During the commercial break, can we please decapitate whosoever chair has been squeaking?  It's his pen.  Take this pen away.  Is that your...  Holy...  Holy...  I'm sorry.  I swear I was ready to just lay into Voss again because that's what we do.  I thought it was you squeaking.  You've been squeaking that thing?  It's my new OCD thing.  Get that goddamn pen away. 
[01:35:00]  I've heard it the entire break.  It's been driving me nothing.  I figured I wouldn't bring it up.  I'd wait till we break and then obviously it was someone's chair, I thought, because no  one could be as obnoxious as to squeak a pen into a live mic for an entire break.  I wasn't even thinking.  It's like my OCD thing.  It's my new one.  But that's a good one.  Ball's right with blood when I do that.  It has to go.  All right, listen.  All right, here.  Hey, going into break, I got to play my favorite contestant from last night.  My favorite.  She was on at 10.02. 
[01:35:30]  You got to have the special cable.  Yeah.  You got to have the special cable to get the post-American Idol stuff.  Oh, what?  The news?  No.  This is one of the contestants.  Oh, I didn't understand.  I couldn't figure out a better way to set this up.  Sorry.  Why?  It was perfect.  I'm such a dope.  I was sitting there thinking, the DVR?  Because I know Channel 5 News, like Fox News does a little story on Idol right after it.  Maybe that's what he's talking about.  Oh, Christ, spit. 
[01:36:00]  Very surprised that this one is not going to Hollywood.  All right.  She might be going to Hollywood, but it's not the singing.  I know.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you are. 
[01:36:30]  I miss that.  We have to have a better relationship with American Idol because she would have killed  last night on TV as one of the goofing. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, she'd have been a star.  Everybody would have been talking about the I Saw the Sign Girl today.  American Idol, you got, you know, come on, pay attention.  She would have been a star.  We got material for you.  She would have been a star last night, right?  Much better than the girl that sang.  If I were the king of the forest, that was hilarious.  Oh, the fat girl?  Yeah, we'll play that next time.  I don't know, though.  Do they do background checks?  Because maybe they wouldn't let her on.  I know they've kicked some contestants off for less. 
[01:37:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Prepare to be wowed.  What mockers?  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow me.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We have Rich Voss in the studio today. 
[01:38:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Lots going on today.  Got to switch gears for a second, then we'll get back to American Idol.  Also got to wish Muhammad Ali a very happy 65th birthday.  And now that he's 65.  Does he know?  Can we make it illegal for him to do that shadow boxing?  The boxing pose for the pictures and stuff.  No one's buying it anymore.  He's in his pictures in the paper and he's doing the pose where he's like, you know, kind of leading with one fist. 
[01:38:30]  He's pulling back the other one and ready to pop you with a right or something.  I don't think so.  That was scary when he was 20, when he was 30, when he was 40, when he was 50.  Sort of scary at 55.  Nah, wow.  Not really scary at 60.  And now completely ridiculous at 65.  Jason's on the phone.  Our pal.  Well, I don't know if he's a pal.  He's an acquaintance of the radio show. 
[01:39:00]  The quick story for the new listeners.  Jason used to bring hookers on to the Opie and Anthony show.  Ladies of the evening.  Yes.  Ran New York Confidential.  And Jason offered us all, Jason Isler, offered us all a free hour of sex.  Yeah.  With one of these gals.  Well, of course, open-end, responsible, turned it down.  I felt it was my duty for the show.  Obligation to do some research.  To greedily sop up my hour like a depraved sponge.  And I did with Natalia, his head girl. 
[01:39:30]  And she was fantastic.  She wound up getting arrested, too.  Yes.  She got arrested.  She's been featured on the covers of magazines.  She's been on The Insider a million times.  And old Jimmy Norton spent some time with her.  I certainly did.  I have a feeling that you're not the only one that took him up on the free hour.  Because the whole show was offered.  I'm thinking there's one more person somewhere around here that may have, I don't know for sure,  that may have secretly went over to the cat house and got their hour. 
[01:40:00]  I'm looking around.  But, yeah, he was busted.  He was making a bloody fortune.  He's been in jail ever since for a long time.  2005, I think, yeah.  He's at Rikers.  I get a lot of messages from Jason at home, but I can't call him back.  There's no number to call back.  If you call from jail, it's like a really weird call.  And the number never shows up on your own.  I don't know how long we should leave him on hold, too.  They don't have a limited time that they're allowed to call.  And he was at the end of his sentence.  And now what?  They gave you more time, Jason?  Well, first of all, it's a pleasure to be on your show. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, man.  And I want to tell you guys, first of all, I better say this to Rich Voss.  Rich Voss, you're a superstar.  Don't destroy me today, okay?  I love you.  You're great.  You're amazing.  Thank you.  Hopi and Anthony, you guys were amazing.  The last time I was in jail, the first time in my life, when I was 34, you have taken it  to the next level.  You guys are so much fucking better.  Excuse the language.  Whoa, hey.  You're in prison.  You guys are on fire.  It's prison language.  It's not a boring minute with you guys.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:41:00]  Jimmy Norton, you know I love you.  You're my friend for life.  You couldn't get away from me if you wanted to.  You're one of the coolest human beings I've ever met.  Thank you, sweetie.  All right.  And Norton, if you could please tell them how gorgeous my place was and how I took it  to the next level for 30 seconds.  It had to be, I don't know how much rent you paid there, but it really was a massive suite  in like Soho or wherever.  I mean, it was like a palace.  $25,000 a month I was paying.  $25,000 a month.  Wow.  And it was, there was different bedrooms.  It was just, it was hot, man.  It was built for sex.  Sounds nice.  Built for sex. 
[01:41:30]  Do you remember the piano?  No, I forgot it.  I was too worried about the organ.  Boom, boom, boom.  26 chandeliers, a million dollars in decorating.  It's the place.  It sounds like you're getting a little nostalgic for those days instead of being in Rikers.  No, no, no, no.  Compared to where you're staying now, what's it like?  When I get out, I'm going to have more gorgeous women and more successful men.  Yeah, but you're not getting out anytime soon because you're not smart.  What happened?  Weren't you at the end of your sentence there?  I had to.  How many months did you have left and then they typed on, I'm here or not? 
[01:42:00]  No, no, the media, hold on.  You guys should know as well as anyone that the media, when you're the one they're writing  about, you're the only one that knows it is not accurate.  Like if I were to read about you guys in the media, the media would not believe freaking  everything that I read.  All right, you got to stop cursing.  Right, I'm going to just say the F word.  Yeah, you got to stop cursing so we get you on.  How much more time do you have in Rikers?  All right, well, first of all, let me explain this.  The way the rules work in Rikers is you get 15 minutes on the phone.  Every five hours.  But luckily for me, I have two inmates with me who are giving me their 15 minutes. 
[01:42:30]  Wow.  So I can go a little longer.  All right, look.  One of them, coincidentally, who you might want to talk to at some point, was a correctional  officer here for 12 years.  Oof.  And he quit in disgust.  He didn't get fired or anything.  And then five years later, he got in trouble for some, you know, his wife got him blocked  up because he was vulnerable, that type of...  No one's guilty.  Right, right.  All right, so he gave you his 15 minutes.  You got to watch that too.  Oh, okay.  Another fellow prisoner gave you 15 minutes.  So what are you going to have to do...  Hold on. 
[01:43:00]  What are you going to have to do in return?  You just don't get 15 minutes from another prisoner.  Cigarettes.  Oh, I have to grease up my tushy.  No, I'm kidding.  All I got to do is ask.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I ask.  I'm in the nicest way.  I'm kind of a celebrity on Rikers Island.  Oh, yeah?  It doesn't take much to be a celebrity here.  Jason...  I have to be a celebrity in New York City or America, but you know.  What happened, dude?  You're in the paper now.  There was a fight you had.  I've been in the paper every day since Wednesday.  What happened about with a fight between you and a Rikers inmate known as Angelina Jolie? 
[01:43:30]  I have to ask.  It was in the Daily News.  By the way, first of all, as you could imagine, the absolute single most humiliating thing that  can happen on Rikers Island is to get your ass kicked by a transsexual.  Right.  All right?  And I didn't only get my ass kicked.  I got my ass kicked so bad that I was put into a coma, and I was sent to Elmer's Hospital,  where they put me through a CAT scan and told me I have brain trauma.  And they said, Jason, consider yourself a boxer, and your career is over. 
[01:44:00]  One more hit to the head, and you'll get an embolism, brain damage, or you could die.  Wow.  And a tranny did that?  Because Rikers Island, I don't know what you know about this place, but this is a third  world country.  Yeah.  You see, I have a lawyer named Paul Bergrin, who was probably one of the three most powerful  and scary individuals in the New York, New Jersey area.  We know him.  He was a major in the Army, which is just below general.  We know him.  He worked on another case close to our hearts.  The Javall Davis case? 
[01:44:30]  No, the Club Soda Kenny case.  Is that true?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay, well, let me tell the people that don't know, because not everyone has the knowledge  you gentlemen have.  Yeah, right?  He was a federal prosecutor in New Jersey for 15 years, which is about 100 times juicier  than a state prosecutor, as you know, but not everyone knows.  Look, Jason, I know you have all the time in the world, but you've got to do some bullet  points here.  We don't have a long time.  I was scared out of my wits that they were going to misquote me in the Post and maybe  have Paul Bergrin a little bit mad at me. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  So I was begging this CO officer to please let me see the article in the paper to see  if I was quoted correctly or incorrectly, because I said only the nicest things about  him.  And was he running your business while you were at Rikers?  I found out about it in the New York Post.  The New York Post.  You had no idea this lawyer was running your business while you were in Rikers?  Of course not.  And then I and then Mel Sachs and my father sent him about 50 letters demanding that he  shut it down because all it could do was get me in more trouble.  So what happened with that?  Now, the transsexual was on the phone and heard you asking to see the article about yourself. 
[01:45:30]  No, no, no.  A CO officer, a correctional officer, was teasing me.  Jason, yeah, you could see in five minutes.  No, I paid a quarter for it.  You know, you're an inmate.  You can't have it.  Back and forth for half an hour.  That's how they treat people here.  Some of them.  Some of them are nice guys, like two or three percent of them.  So what happened with the tranny?  Yeah.  What happened with the tranny?  How'd that get started?  The tranny wanted to transfer out of where I am, like the celebrity section or where they  keep people that are like just total, total.  Well, you call it the celebrity section. 
[01:46:00]  Who else is around you that you would consider a celebrity?  What crime do they do?  Well, I mean, Lilo Brancato is a has-been.  He was a celebrity when he was 17 in one movie, which he got paid $25,000 for, The Bronx Tale.  Oh, right.  So he's considered a celebrity.  But then again, he's probably the only star who's ever killed a cop in the history of America.  It's more like protective custody.  So it's, you know, like he was saying, the corrections officer, that all of a sudden he's in jail.  You know, you can't just put him in general.  Right.  Hello?  Oh, Jason's gone.  I knew that would happen. 
[01:46:30]  We would never get to the tranny story.  But in all fairness, he said he had 40 minutes.  Yeah, but in all fairness, the guy cannot stay on track.  I wanted to hear, we were trying to guide him toward the tranny story.  That was it, yeah.  And that's all we really wanted to know about from him today.  And we got nothing.  It's hard to tell a story when you're looking over your shoulder every two seconds to see  who's coming up behind you.  Well, now that's-  That and-  Well, what does the paper say, Jimmy?  The paper said-  Because he might call back.  The paper said he was, uh, self-proclaimed, uh, was humbled Saturday when a transsexual Rikers 
[01:47:00]  Island inmate known as Angelina Jolie sent him to the hospital.  Itzler, who's behind bars, serraining over, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, uh, clashed  at Rikers with Shannon Walker, 29, uh, Sharon Walker, I'm sorry, a full-breasted man who  goes by the name of the Pouty Beauty.  Walker tried to punch at me, so I grabbed her in a bear hug, Itzler told the Daily News.  She took two fingers and stuck them deep into my eyes. 
[01:47:30]  I'm going to editorialize and say, Jason, believe me with those fingers, it could have  been worse.  Itzler, 39, alleged an unnamed correction officer, let her punch me in the face eight  or ten times.  He let her kick me in the head until I was out cold, and the CAT scan did find severe brain  trauma.  Angelina was on the phone, he said.  She walked up to me and said, if you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to break your face.  And even though she has a penis, she looks like a woman.  I've never hit a woman in my life.  Wait, wait, Jason, so you didn't fight back because you don't fight, you don't punch women 
[01:48:00]  in the face, even though this guy had a male...  First of all, have any of you three hit a woman in your life?  No, but a tranny?  That's not a woman?  Tell me isn't a woman.  That's not a woman?  This person took all those chemicals and has size C breasts and milks them for all they're  worth.  Right.  Now, her face, I don't know if you saw it.  Did you see Chris Rock in New Jack City?  Yes.  Imagine that face, a cross between that face and Mike Tyson's big, big fat moon head. 
[01:48:30]  That's the head on Angelina Jolie.  So she's an ugly tranny.  All right.  But the body looks like a woman and all these, I'm not going to say retards in jail because  they'll kick my ass.  Yeah.  All these fine gentlemen that I'm in jail with look at her like a woman and sit close  to her and you know what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Use her.  Okay, exactly.  So why did you have a problem with her?  Well, that's what I'll get to.  And remember, I have all the time in the world.  I just got to keep calling back.  No, we don't.  We have a very, very tight schedule because of commercial laws and we have to leave here. 
[01:49:00]  I'm like Donald Trump.  No commercials today.  Just kidding.  Just kidding.  All right.  So what exactly happened with her?  I'll call you.  That guy's so annoying.  That guy's so annoying.  Jason, what happened with her?  Yeah, what happened?  She wanted to transfer for seven days.  But in this place, when you want something, you don't get it.  You got to pretend you don't want it to get what you want.  Yeah.  See, you're getting sidetracked again.  Just talk about the fight.  She wanted to transfer to the general population so she could make money giving sex to people and getting  sex.  Right.  All right.  She couldn't get sex in where I am.  The only way to get moved is to get into a fight. 
[01:49:30]  I'm known as the only person on this island who will take punches and not punch back because  I need the telephone from my PR campaign.  Okay.  If you go to the box, you don't get the telephone.  I need the telephone and I can take a punch.  So she comes up to me, tells me she's going to break my face and I walk away, you know.  And then after she gets off the phone, she comes charging at me.  And I tell the CO officer, I'm like, listen, man, I don't want to get into a fight. 
[01:50:00]  This guy, girl in cell one wants to kick my ass.  So, uh, oh, by the way, at any moment, like, like the goon squad come in here and start  beating me with bats.  Wait, you snitched.  I'm not allowed to tell the secrets of this island.  You snitched to a CO officer that somebody wanted to beat you up and they didn't kill  you?  And they didn't what?  Kill you for snitching?  Almost did.  You're admitting on the air that you told, uh, you told the CO and that you don't like  to punch back and that you can take a punch.  I asked permission to have a fight because if you get permission to have a fight, you  can't go to the box. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, really?  Okay.  So, but I didn't want to say that because I would get, I don't want to get anyone in  trouble.  All right.  But, um, so anyway, so this group, this girl guy is about to punch me.  So I hug her.  Like, you know how boxers like tangle up and they can't seem to punch each other.  I thought I'd learned that from watching Mike Tyson all these years.  From watching boxing.  Sure.  You could learn that.  Yeah.  So when I grabbed her, she takes two fingers and pushes one of my eyeballs three inches  into my head.  Oh, wow.  And starts scratching my face. 
[01:51:00]  I immediately let go of her.  She starts punching me in the face like a man.  She is a man.  All right.  So I wrestled in high school and college.  What I did was I kept one hand on my side and I grabbed her windpipe with the other hand  because in this island, they don't love white people so much and they certainly don't like  Jewish people.  You guys know I'm Jewish, right?  Right.  Oh, please.  Okay?  So I can't hurt her.  I've never heard it called a windpipe before, but...  First of all, I don't hate girls.  And second of all, if I do anything wrong, they want to bury me. 
[01:51:30]  They don't like that I'm in the paper all the time, stuff like that.  These people have pretty shitty lives here.  Well, you could say they have pretty crappy lives here.  Oh, so good.  That's all right.  They have crappy lives, right?  That's okay.  They have, um...  Yeah.  I love the fact that he won't punch a woman in the face, but he fully supports prostitution.  Yeah.  No, no, that's not true.  You're brilliant, man.  Jason, when are you getting out?  You're brilliant.  You guys let me on the show.  In a couple weeks, I'll read you a letter from one of my escorts who's currently starring  in the play Wicked on Broadway. 
[01:52:00]  And you'll see...  Really?  What's her name?  The girls like gold, and they had the time of their life with me, and I am not a pimp.  I am a visionary businessman.  Wait, what's the girl's name who's in Wicked?  Oh, the girl's name that's on Wicked because I'm a loser that would reveal the privacy of  a girl that I love is...  I'm not telling.  There's a wicked whore of the West.  All right, but one of the cast members of Wicked, this is big news, used to work for  you.  Are you kidding?  Do you have any idea...  Was it Julia?  Hold on.  Do you know the politicians that use my place? 
[01:52:30]  Was it Kendra?  Oh, boy.  The millionaires that use my place?  Was it David?  I have more...  Oh, that's a guy.  Politicians, huh?  Jenna?  Do you remember J. Edgar Hoover?  Yes.  Of course.  You know how he had a file on everyone in America?  Did he beat him to one of his president?  I got a bigger one, and I'll tell you this.  The Daily News confirms it.  Not one of my clients was arrested or hassled.  All right, let's make some news today.  Give me a name.  Give me a high-profile name of someone you have nothing to lose that used your service.  All right, put it this way.  In 30 to 60 days...  You got 30 seconds, by the way. 
[01:53:00]  What do you mean I got 30 seconds?  You reveal a name right now.  Let's go.  Oh, okay.  Then you'll let me rock and roll, right?  Yeah.  Then you can do whatever the hell you want.  You can take over the entire show.  I don't have a name.  Fuck.  Stop cursing!  Those aren't names.  I said Fuh.  Fuh.  F-U-H.  All right, we learned this much, though.  This is something the paper will be interested in.  A cast member of the play Wicked that's on Broadway here in New York City.  Yeah.  Used to work for Jason, who's on the phone live from Rikers.  The DOA wants to hang up the phone. 
[01:53:30]  I mean...  Oh.  Well, that seems to be it for Jason.  All right.  Someone hung the phone up.  What is DOA, Ken?  You're on arrival.  No, I know that.  What's DOA in the old joint?  No, all right.  The DOA.  You don't think this guy's going to get stabbed in prison?  He's nuts.  You should have an over-under on when he gets...  He is really annoying, but he's nuts, and, you know, he gives us good radio. 
[01:54:00]  I want to know how much time he's got left, because he was saying he's going to be out  in a month and out in a month, and I hear he's got four years tacked on, but that  might not be true.  Yeah, we're hearing they tacked on, and I heard another year.  Oh, a year.  But I've also heard four years.  Yeah, Jimmy, you're right.  Wow.  So something's going on.  He said he hugged the transvestite, and then she poked him in the eye.  That's never happened to you, has it?  I don't know what you're talking about.  All right, listen.  Not that I.  Listen, we're going to step aside.  Quick break.  Hopefully, he'll call back.  We'll get more from Jason from Rikers.  I don't think he'll be calling back.  I want to apologize to WISP in Philly. 
[01:54:30]  I guess right in the middle of that very interesting radio, they had to run their stupid national  contest.  What?  Something they warned us about, but it's just awful radio.  They just cut into the show.  Doesn't matter.  They're just cut in, and then it's like 15 seconds of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Some dumb national contest they're doing.  Wow.  And I have to mention it, because the instant feedback's going nuts.  Like, ah, they have the worst timing in the world right in the middle of the setup of  who you were talking to.  They went into this national contest.  That's good for the show. 
[01:55:00]  Sweeper.  A sweeper?  Something, yeah.  Oh, man.  I don't know exactly, because I'm not listening on YSP right now, so.  Is it call at 3 o'clock?  I don't know.  Blah, blah, blah.  If you have to do that, maybe you can figure out, you know, when it makes the most sense.  I would only forgive that if it was for the Carter and Fester show.  Carter and Fester?  All right.  More with Jason, hopefully, from Rikers and some other things.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I love showing my f***ing introverted fat guys. 
[01:55:30]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Sex.  Are you ready?  Yep.  Are we taping?  Right now?  Oh, shit.  Um, okay, here we go.  As soon as Danny f***ing walks over here.  Eric.  Why is Eric calling me?  Hello?  Hello?  I left.  Why?  What do you need?  I need to get something signed by you, but I forgot to do it.  What do you need signed, dude?  I have a phone, but I need to get signed by you. 
[01:56:00]  A photo?  If you're nowhere near, that's not a problem.  We'll just do it next time you come in, I guess.  Well, dude, I mean, it's kind of a...  Why don't you run?  Can you run down with the s***?  I'll come, you know, I'm right up at the corner.  Yeah, I'll come down.  All right, I'm at T-Mobile.  Call up to T-Mobile.  Okay, well done.  Fuck it, Eric.  That was a fact.  All right, I'm going to be at...  Where am I?  Did you write it down, jackass?  Oh, you're mad at me.  All right, what's up?  This is Robert Kelly. 
[01:56:30]  Poor Eric.  You know he's at T-Mobile looking for me.  All right, I'm going to be at the Punchline, Atlanta, February 1st to the 3rd.  Call 404-252-LAFF.  Just give the phone number.  You know what?  404-252-5233, which spells laugh.  Did he walk up yet?  Did he leave?  All right, fucking Eric.  Poor Eric.  I got to go.  All right, I got to go.  So make sure you go to my MySpace and check for my other dates.  Enjoy my mailing list, you bunch of humps. 
[01:57:00]  You know what?  Go fuck yourselves.  I got to get poor Eric at T-Mobile.  I'm a man.  I'm a goddess.  Well, I'm a virgin.  I'm a man.  I'm a blue movie.  I'm a bitch.  I'm a man.

Get people's tails and things like that.  Well, you did it.  Didn't you feel like you could have won?  No.  What did you do?  No.  Everybody that plays Hold'em for any length of time, like a couple of weeks, you always  think, I think I could go to the World Series of Poker and do it.  No.  They chew you up and spit you out. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  I thought I was good when we went, when I did that tournament once, the celebrity tournament  thing.  And that was, you know, what, a couple of years ago?  You were in the middle of the pack?  I've still been playing.  Yeah, I know.  But when the pros came in, it was over.  Phil Gordon came in.  He sits down and goes, I sit here, I got my chips.  And I was just like, done.  Done.  Did he whip you?  Oh, I was a girl.  I couldn't do anything.  I was a little short-stacked, so, you know, I didn't have that many chips on the table. 
[02:00:00]  And he comes over with these trays of chips, and he's just bullying everybody.  Because then you can't bet.  You bet something.  He's just going to, like, bet ten times more.  So now you're committed.  You know, it's now or never.  You're either out or in, you know?  So if you don't have a good enough hand, you've got to fold.  Yeah, but if you had the good hands, you would have had those chips, and you could have bullied him.  You just didn't get the hands in the beginning.  No, there are people that get the stacks of chips with no hands.  They just know how to bet and play and scare people into thinking they have the good hands. 
[02:00:30]  Make you fold a bluff, yeah.  Yeah, if you're sitting there, and there's a possibility that somebody has a flush on the board.  Yeah.  And, you know, you're sitting there, and somebody might have a pair.  And he bets.  And you just nail over the top of him and bet twice what he bet.  The guy's going to start thinking, maybe this guy's got a flush, you know?  And sometimes you get him to fold like that.  Meanwhile, the guy had nothing. 
[02:01:00]  But he's raking in the chips.  And, Rich, the wide-eyed look on your face and the dumb head nod means that you'd probably start eating chips.  That's a tell right there.  It tells everyone you're a dope.  There'd be all characters.  There's the Unabomber and you there with a dunce hat.  The dunce.  Rich, the dunce boss.  What would be your bluff move?  I would first...  And what would your outfit be for hold?  Would you have a gimmick? 
[02:01:30]  Would you have a gimmick?  Would you have, like, a hoodie on, pulled tight around your face?  Would you go with the sunglasses, like, a little Unabomber action?  I would go comfortable.  I would wear a nice T-shirt, probably my New York Dolls, my lucky T-shirt.  Lucky T-shirt.  And...  Big Star of David card protector that you put on so they don't take your cards.  And I just...  You know, I used to play cards.  So, I mean, I know...  You know the suits?  I just know...  What do you know?  I know when... 
[02:02:00]  You know...  You know...  If I have a good hand, how to draw somebody in...  Minutes to learn, a lifetime to master, they say.  Oh, whatever.  And you're just like, I've played cards before.  I've played P-Norkel.  And maybe you can sit there with your bag and be Rich the Tranny Voss.  Yeah, really.  All right, whatever, Rich.  Good luck to you.  Good luck.  World Series of Poker.  We cash you in that bag.  Yeah.  And maybe that'll cover the entry fee.  Attorney found naked in courthouse with 14-year-old. 
[02:02:30]  I'd say that's a headline you'd never, ever want to be part of.  This is...  If you're an attorney, especially.  I guess as...  I guess as far as all the stories we covered today, this is the story of the day.  Yeah, this guy wasn't using discretion.  Happened in Philly, huh?  Philly.  What up, Philly?  Was that the contest?  It was on Martin Luther King's birthday, too.  On Martin Luther King Day.  The courts were closed.  But they were open for...  They leave the court open if lawyers want to conduct some kind of after-hours business. 
[02:03:00]  He was conducting some business in a little conference room.  Right.  Completely naked.  Or have sex with your mistress.  Mistress.  This was his goddaughter.  Goddaughter?  Goddaughter.  Yeah.  And he was 49?  Yep.  49.  She's 14.  He was completely naked.  A sheriff's deputy found him naked with a 14-year-old girl in a courthouse conference room.  Walked into the conference room.  A sheriff's deputy walks into the conference room.  There's the guy naked. 
[02:03:30]  14-year-old girl.  And what do you say?  It's a sheriff's deputy fining you.  You can't...  What's your defense there?  Die.  I'm a liar.  Die.  He's using the die defense.  There's nothing you can say.  49 has been charged with solicitation, attempted statutory sexual assault, and related counts.  A sheriff's deputy making his rounds in the criminal justice center on Monday afternoon  looked into a lawyer's conference room on the third floor and discovered Charles and the girl. 
[02:04:00]  He had asked for sex, but there was no physical contact we're aware of by the time the deputy arrived in the scene.  Yeah, just in time.  Saved this girl.  Is there any more to this story that we know?  I don't know.  I think he'll be disbarred.  I think that's a little obvious.  But, man, I wonder what he was doing, like, taking all of his clothes off.  And she's just standing there.  Apparently, they hadn't cut a deal or anything.  Or were they doing this before? 
[02:04:30]  I need a little back story on it.  He's the godfather of this girl.  I think they were doing it before.  Yeah.  And, yeah, he was going for another round, and he got caught.  Some comment from one of the parents saying that, you know, he was very trustworthy, and they were shocked, and blah, blah, blah.  The ones you've got to look at.  Look out.  The trustworthy ones are the ones you've got to look at very closely.  Did he coach the little league team or the soccer team?  I'm sure more will come out.  That's what he's doing.  One of those situations around children. 
[02:05:00]  You hope people are shocked.  Because if you're naked with a 14-year-old and the girl's parents are like, we kind of expected that.  Yeah, he's done it before.  We're trying to, yeah.  What are you going to do?  We talk to him.  Life of the party, this guy.  It's time.  It's time.  Nothing you have ever seen before, and nothing you have ever heard before, will prepare you for the shock of...  My baby is black. 
[02:05:30]  Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, bold story never before told on the screen.  My baby is black, and I'm dodging it.  What do we know about this film?  It's from 1961.  61?  Yeah, a little film called My Baby is Black.  E-Rock, you do a little research on the internet?  It's a French import art film.  And what was the purpose of this film?  Really just to show a white lady dating a black guy and how everybody was not happy with it. 
[02:06:00]  The dangers of the black man and the white woman.  Yeah.  61.  Yeah.  We were getting there by 61.  Barely.  Barely, but kind of.  We just got on the highway.  Yeah.  We just got on the highway.  So this kind of...  I bet it went over very well, especially down south.  Just about on the highway.  Just adjusting the streets.  Yeah.  And the mirrors. 
[02:06:30]  Getting the right freaking station on.  I think we had probably muzzled up the German Shepherds and capped up the fire hydrants by 61.  A little bit.  For the most part.  In most civilized cities.  Sorry, Alabama.  We're not talking about you.  No.  I make my daughters watch that movie every night.  Is that?  Two rules.  You got them growing up to it.  Like where you would normally put in The Little Mermaid.  Two rules.  Put this in.  All right.  No blacks and no coloreds.  Let's play some more clips from My Baby is Black from 1961. 
[02:07:00]  In this clip, class watching an educational film, social workers talk about civilizing black kids.  Oh, okay.  Hello there.  Hello, Bon Bon.  They're like puppies.  You train them with candy.  Here.  Wow.  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  They're like puppies.  You train them with candy.  No, because when you get mad at them, you can't take them in the woods and shoot them. 
[02:07:30]  Wow.  This comes on the day that Obama's basically saying he's going for it.  Well, this is many years ago.  We've come a long way.  Maybe it is time.  We've come a long way.  You can just tell how long we've come.  I know.  Bon Bon's are so fattening.  Who eats them?  Hello there.  Hello, Bon Bon.  They're like puppies.  You train them with candy.  Here. 
[02:08:00]  What can you do?  More polite to strangers than to us.  And we do everything for them.  Quite discouraging.  How long have you been in social work?  Not long enough to understand them.  Not even a smile from you, Jamal.  Not a bit of gratitude.  You try to help civilize them.  You give them decent houses so they can live like people, not animals.  Give them real houses and they make pigsties out of them.  They live with their lice and their dirt.  No.  Believe me, mister, I know them well. 
[02:08:30]  I've tried everything.  Threat and kindness.  Nothing works against their stubbornness, their laziness.  Besides, they're sneaky and liars.  Miserable.  They should be isolated and disinfected, too.  Believe me, sir.  Discipline is important.  And a strong hand would do the much good.  All right.  Remember how I said I would never get married again?  Yeah.  All right.  You'd marry her?  I might just. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, my God.  Teasing, of course.  She's a horrible, horrible woman.  Is this amazing or what?  That's some good points.  You insane, Rich?  Wow, this is really not liberal.  I mean, you know, I think we have to hear more of what she says.  Of course.  All right.  You point to it.  The next clip, Professor Discusses Film During Talk About Color Lecture.  Talk About Color Lecture. 
[02:09:30]  Okay.  Unfortunate, but that's the way most people think today.  For them, the African, the Negro, can never be anything.  The Negro.  The Negro.  Okay.  Now, he's refuting her claims, I guess, is what it sounds like.  Unfortunately, this is how people think.  This is a good cop, bad cop.  Yeah, good cop, bad cop.  But he's calling them the Negro.  Try it at home.  The Negro.  It's fun to say.  It rolls off the tongue.  The Negro. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, unfortunate, but that's the way most people think today.  For them, the African, the Negro, can never be anything.  The Negro.  The African, the Negro.  I'm going to say that all day now.  The Negro.  Unfortunate, but that's the way most people think today.  For them, the African, the Negro, can never be anything but inferior. 
[02:10:30]  It is useless to tell these people otherwise.  Is this the philosophy lecture?  No.  It's talk about color.  We have just seen a story on the...  Is this the Opie and Anthony show?  That's Alan Cohn's grandfather.  Hey, let's say hi to Mark in Hoboken.  Mark, what's up?  Oh, I love it.  I love it.  We should have that lady today.  If she hit it right on the head, you have to train them. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, here we go.  Oh, boy.  It's just...  Here they come out of the woodwork.  Oh, boy.  Thinking that this isn't a real educational film we're playing.  Maybe Obama doesn't have a shot.  See?  That's what I'm talking about.  We're playing this.  The listeners are turning me, I guess.  I like playing these things because it shows, like, it's nostalgia.  It shows where we were as opposed to where we are right now, and then you get calls like  that, and that's when I go, see? 
[02:11:30]  I don't have a chance.  I'm all excited about Obama.  There's too many.  Too many of the guys like that.  I'm looking at the possibilities, and then the listeners remind me.  Oh, yeah.  Who is running for office?  Oh, yeah.  The Negro.  My president is black.  The Negro.  Well, Frank, it looks like he's the Negro. 
[02:12:00]  It's talk about dollar.  We have just seen a story on the Arab, who is a white man.  Comprehend me.  Practically speaking, we could equally well have used any racial minority as victims.  The yellow race, for example.  The yellow peril.  Unfortunate.  The yellow race.  The yellow peril.  The yellow peril.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a little harsh.  Sounds like a tongue twister.  Yellow peril.  Yellow peril.  Yellow. 
[02:12:30]  That is hard.  Yellow peril.  Yellow peril.  Yeah.  That's impossible to say.  Well, I should say it once.  Yellow peril.  Well, racial minority as victims.  The yellow race, for example.  The yellow peril.  Unfortunately, racism is a leper, gaining more ground every day, and as such, should be  dealt with seriously and intelligently.  Is any one race on Earth superior?  Hand down, Anthony. 
[02:13:00]  Sorry.  How about we not answer that question, Anthony?  How about we just play track four?  I just wanted to answer, and I raised my hand first.  I thought I'd be picked on, and okay.  I won't answer it.  Next track, White Friend Asks Black Man About Shaving.  From My Baby Is Black, 1961.  White Friend Asks a Black Man About Shaving.  Okay.  Good morning.  Good morning. 
[02:13:30]  I wonder why you shave like that.  You don't have any more...  Stereotypical white guy.  I wonder why you shave like that.  Why do you shave like that?  With a gun to my back.  With that white woman.  Yes.  Holding the razor with your foot.  Oh, jeez.  Sounds like, uh...  Sounds like the character from The Flintstones you do.  Ah.  Ah.  But I am Rock Quarry.  Yeah, Rock Quarry.  Thank you.  Hey, Negro.  Why do you shave like that?  I'm Rock Quarry. 
[02:14:00]  But I am Rock Quarry.  Listen again.  It's Rock Quarry.  Ah.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I wonder why you shave like that.  I don't have any more...  I wonder why you shave like that.  Ah.  Using that piece of broken coconut.  Man. 
[02:14:30]  God.  No wonder Halle Berry just lost her mind when she won an Academy Award.  And like...  I guess we really don't understand.  We just don't get it.  We don't get it.  Like, this is just so bad.  And this is supposed to be good.  Yeah.  As opposed to good...  Yeah, this is supposed to be like the anti-racism.  This is supposed to be helpful.  Yeah.  This is helping the colored.  Well, maybe they should take it out of the comedy section of Blockbuster. 
[02:15:00]  Is that where it is?  It's right next to 48 hours.  I love that movie.  Good morning.  I wonder why you shave like that.  You don't have any more beard than a hen's egg.  Right.  It's a stupid habit.  Why do you say that?  Because...  Anyway, I prefer looking like this to looking like...  To looking like the good negro.  Which one is that?  Well, the one who shines shoes.  The one who is always so polite.  The one who always says thank you whenever he gets his tips. 
[02:15:30]  Sounds like Michael Richards there, too.  The...  That was the black guy talking, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And he's talking about how he...  Did he shave or not shave?  I can't figure this out.  He wants to be better than the shoeshine black guy.  He wants to be better than the shoeshine black guy who has the scruffy beard.  Yeah.  So he shaves even though he doesn't have much hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just so he could...  Because it curls up or something.  Yeah, he's trying to keep all kept.  Right, right. 
[02:16:00]  And the guy's white guy is so stupid.  He's like, why bother?  And us whitey would know the difference between...  Thinking he shaved his entire body.  He shaved...  Stupid whitey.  He's clean shaven, so he's nothing like the shoeshine black guy.  Yeah, right.  Shoeshine.  Egro!  This guy would be classified back then as uppity.  Because he was kind of, you know, hey, he's kind of coming into his own.  Yeah, well...  He says what?  Mouth and off.  You don't have more hair than a hen's egg.  A hen's egg.  That could be the best term for a smooth face to have ever had. 
[02:16:30]  No!  I hear the music.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Son of a bitch.  We gave him a little taste.  We got, I don't know, at least 15 more clips to go.  Oh, God.  At least we got into it a little bit.  Amazing bastard.  We'll continue tomorrow with such tracks as interracial love has to overcome barriers.  Phew.  Parents freak out discovering daughter's pregnancy.  Oh, no.  Black neighbor tells girl her boyfriend was arrested.  Black boyfriend in jail for hitting a butcher torturing a black kid. 
[02:17:00]  And dream sequence deciding to have the baby or not.  All on the next Opie and Anthony show as we look into My Baby is Black from 1961.  All right, Rich, give that plug again.  Palms, February 10th.  Comedy Central Countdown.  Hope we make it.  Thanks.  All right.  Very, very good.  Hey, guys.  Thanks so much.  You like what you're hearing?  Please tell a friend.  That's how we spread the ONA virus.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day. 
[02:17:30]  My day and I'm out.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony wow stickers are your tickets to a successful whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, yeah.  Did you know that WoW stickers have many other uses?  I built my entire house out of WoW stickers and two-by-fours.  Solid as a rock.  Oh, crap. I'm not insured. 
[02:18:00]  It's Ovi and Anthony!  It's the Ovi and Anthony Show!  Ovi and Anthony are taking a break from the XM walkover today  because it's too fucking cold.  What's the temperature today?  50 below my asshole!  50 below my asshole! 
[02:18:30]  The sea with all water!  59 below my малень horror...  What's the nature of the雪?  50 below my asshole! 
[02:19:00]  130 below my asshole!  6�로...  200 below my asshole!  속옆 8 below your head...  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Thank you. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you. 
[02:20:30]  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  Thank you. 
[02:21:30]  Thank you.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:22:00]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol CM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead. 
[02:22:30]  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, let's.  Second half of the Opie and Anthony Show has begun.  Yes.  On XM Satellite Radio.  And I don't know if we're doing the walkover anymore.  Well, not anymore anymore. 
[02:23:00]  We're going to kind of do a day-by-day basis.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's, I would say, weather permitting.  Well, but I think it would be fun if there's a blizzard or it's snowing really hard.  Oh, yeah.  A blizzard or snow would be cool.  That's fine.  Because that would be so different.  But for the most part, I think the walkover is over until March.  Typically, it's not as cold when it's snowing as it is when it's not snowing and it's just 
[02:23:30]  cold out.  Right.  And especially in a blizzard.  In blizzards, it's usually not that cold.  Yeah.  Basically, we want to rest a bit.  I'd love to do it in a blizzard.  That would be kind of fun.  We still walk, by the way.  We still walk every day from, you know, the other place to here.  So we encourage the fans to still show up and do the walk with us.  And then we invite you upstairs.  They're letting people upstairs right now.  But I think it's time to kind of rest the whole bit.  I was out the door of Free FM or FM affiliate.  Out the door and walking. 
[02:24:00]  Jimmy was right there.  Keeping up is the term you're looking for.  Yeah.  Keeping up.  I got here in record time.  No one could see me.  I was looking at the sidewalk and all I saw were feet that would kind of come close to  me and then realize I wasn't moving because I can't see you.  Yeah.  So get the fuck out of my way.  And stepping over like holes in the sidewalk.  I have my hood pulled up.  See?  You made fun of my parka.  Now it comes in handy.  Well, I got a very similar one.  I know.  Very warm.  You look almost like twins.  I put my little gloves on. 
[02:24:30]  I was warm.  And then Jimmy's asking me, are you cold?  He goes, how about you?  And then a wind blew.  And he goes, how about your legs?  I go, yeah, they're a little cold now.  It blows right through.  And all I'm thinking is what it would be like to be crossing that street and get hit by  a car and have to lay there in that, like on the cold concrete, like with a broken leg  or a broken femur.  Oh, my God.  Do you think that would, like, take your mind off of how freezing cold it is to lay on the  pavement or just add to it?  I don't know how Voss does that walk in a skirt because the wind had to just be blowing up. 
[02:25:00]  Blowing right up your pussy.  Yeah, your mic's not on.  Mic's off.  Why would it be on?  Mic's off.  So he turns his headphones up.  Holy fucking mission control.  Well, I can't turn it on.  Rich.  What?  See the silver button that's been in front of you on the back of that microphone?  I can't believe you can't figure out how to turn your mic on.  See that thing?  No, the button on top.  Top, dude.  That thing.  There you go. 
[02:25:30]  As long as the other button's pushed, that should work.  Speak.  Is it on?  No.  No.  It was for a split second.  Is that snapping?  What are you doing, Rich?  I'm trying to push the button.  Which button are you trying to push?  The silver one in the back.  Is that the right button there?  Talking to it now.  Yeah.  I'm on.  All right.  Rich is pushing a button.  Go ahead, Rich.  Okay.  Hold on.  Oh, you guys are messing with me.  No, we're not messing with you.  I can't.  There's no button.  You've never hit that button on this show since you've been here. 
[02:26:00]  Never.  What about the button that's next to the headphones?  There should be a button or a knob or something.  Don't make it too loud or the mic will distort.  Yeah.  Oh, I can hear you guys good.  Yeah.  All right.  That's all that counts.  Okay.  You got it turned on now?  I don't know.  There it is.  I hear you.  For real?  Yeah.  Just not through the mic, though.  No, we can hear you.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, go ahead.  Talk.  Are your headphones?  Yeah, my headphones are perfect. 
[02:26:30]  What were we talking about?  You're walking over in the walkover in a skirt.  Oh, there was no rebuttal.  That was my hilarity.  My hilarious joke.  Why was there no rebuttal?  We're talking about wind blowing up your pussy.  My snatch.  It's not a pussy.  It's a snatch.  Your snatch, right.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  Could anything you said being about hit by a car and laying in the cold, how horrible.  What?  What are you laughing at?  I was just turning up your mic because I could barely hear you. 
[02:27:00]  Go ahead.  It is low.  How horrible.  Can you imagine these people that ice skate and fall through the water?  You're the dumbest human being, Rich.  What the fuck?  Are we on break?  New content.  Are we on break?  Are we on break?  What a dummy.  Of course we are.  I do not love Rich.  American dummy.  If you think you're dumber than Rich Voss, give us a call.  Rich.  This is how.  Let's not love Rich Voss.  I just didn't have your mic on. 
[02:27:30]  There you go.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Hey, there's Rich Voss, ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss joining the program today.  You were trying to push a button behind the mic that doesn't exist.  I know.  I was stabbing myself with this little metal thing.  Okay, so you got me on a technicality.  A technicality.  Don't touch that.  It does nothing.  I know.  A little metal thing.  All right, so my mic wasn't on.  But I was saying how, when you, you know what I was talking about falling on the cold?  How horrible it's got to be.  These people that fall through ice when they're ice skating. 
[02:28:00]  I don't think, I don't think that is as bad as just being out in the cold.  I think when you fall through the ice, at first, it really sucks.  But very quickly, you just don't feel it anymore.  You'll lose consciousness and you're dead.  But having to, having to walk a few blocks, now that's bad.  All right.  I'm not into it.  And I got like zero sleep.  I napped like an old man or a baby when I got home. 
[02:28:30]  And it screwed me up so bad.  And then I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  Instead of putting on something, because I fall asleep with the TV on, I should put on something that I don't want to watch.  But even stuff I've seen a thousand times, like I'm thumbing through the channels and I could put on some bad friggin' chick flick or something awful that I know I'd fall asleep to in two seconds.  And I put on Apollo 13.  Like, I know I'm not going to sleep to that. 
[02:29:00]  So I'm looking at the clock and I'm going, I'll be asleep before, you know, it even says, Houston, we got a problem.  And there it is.  Splash down.  Apollo 13 has made it fast.  I'm like, I watched the whole goddamn movie.  It's two in the morning and I got to get up, like, now.  In a couple hours.  I'm an asshole.  I'm a fuckin' idiot.  That's me last night.  I'm a fuckin' idiot.  I watched the whole movie.  I'm a fuckin' idiot.  I know how it ends and everything. 
[02:29:30]  I'm a fuckin' idiot.  I'm a fuckin' idiot.  What a great movie this was.  I'm a fuckin' idiot.  I'll put this on.  I'm a fuckin' idiot.  I'm trying to go to sleep.  I'll put it on Boogie Nights.  All right, well.  So, the walkover.  We don't know what we're gonna do with that for now.  Yeah.  Just relax.  You know, between now and March, I'm sure we'll do a few walkovers, because it'll make sense.  I think if it snows...  But in general, we're not doing the walkover until early March.  If it snows, people should pull you two along in toboggans. 
[02:30:00]  That'd be nice.  Hey, here's a guy that has fallen through the ice.  Let's go here.  All right.  Uh, it's Hound from Pennsylvania.  Hound.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I've fallen through ice.  I know better.  At first, it feels like someone hit your entire body with a damn fly swatter, and then it just  slowly becomes more painful.  Well, how much air...  I was in...  Wait, how does it feel like you've been hit by a fly swatter?  I'm trying to understand that one.  Stinging?  Like, all over your body?  Every...  Yeah, your entire body just stings like you've been slapped. 
[02:30:30]  And then for about...  I was in for about six minutes before I got pulled up out.  Six minutes?  Wow.  What the hell were you doing?  The backstroke?  Well...  Um...  Numbly trying to yank myself out of a hole in the ice.  How much air is between the water and the ice?  How much, like...  What do you have, about like four inches?  I was only in about...  Oh my God, Rich.  Five and a half feet of water standing on the bottom of the water.  Rich thinks he was under the ice, like...  Oh my God.  Yeah, that's right.  Breathing in a little James Bond gap of air.  Floating down the river and your friends are running along... 
[02:31:00]  No, he fell through the...  Your blue face through the ice.  He fell through the ice, but he was still in the hole.  Like...  Oh, were you still in the hole?  Your whole body wasn't immersed, right?  You were...  That's what I was talking about.  People that fall all the way in and go under.  Well, he was holding on to the edge.  I was only up to, like, my neck.  And you were holding on to the edge, and you couldn't pull yourself out, because the ice is slippery.  He's wet.  I am numb.  You can't feel.  You can't use your hands to hold on.  You'll lose, like, muscle control really quickly.  Oh, unbelievably. 
[02:31:30]  So how'd you get saved?  I had a couple of friends that were there with me, and they belly crawled out.  I was only about 10 feet out on a pond.  So you were numb from the waist down?  No, I was numb from my eyeballs down.  I hit the...  When I went in, I was only in five and a half feet of water, so I was up about to my chin.  But, I mean, when it splashed me in the face, it knocked the wind out of me.  I couldn't feel anything.  And almost immediately, you stiffen up.  Your legs don't want to work. 
[02:32:00]  Your arms get tired.  It's horrible.  That's a good time to rape them.  How little did your dick get?  That must be severe shrinkage, man.  Falling through the ice.  I'm pretty sure it came out the back.  Well, how...  Now, they got you out of the water.  Then what did you do?  Did you walk, or did they drag you off the ice?  No, we were...  I was about 17.  We were sled riding.  They threw me on a sled and drug me to my house.  I was covered in coats.  They drug me back to the house and then ran a cold shower over me. 
[02:32:30]  Why cold shower?  Know what you have to do?  Know what you have to do?  I watch Man vs. Wild.  Oh.  Gotta do push-ups.  Really?  Gotta get your body temperature up.  Yeah, you gotta get the blood flowing.  So, what they...  I would think you would want to keep your core temperature warm and not disperse it to your  outer limbs.  They suggest you do push-ups and stuff.  Get that heart pumping immediately.  Are you shitting me?  That's what Man vs. Wild taught me.  Bad time for calisthenics.  Yeah, you don't feel like doing it, but that's what...  In the water.  Just doing the doggy paddle.  Right.  We wouldn't want to do them in Honolulu, much less in five-degree weather. 
[02:33:00]  Exactly.  Frozen liquid.  Wait, yeah, hold on a minute.  The dumbness of Rich Voss amazes all of us, including Mike in Pennsylvania.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, yeah, guys.  I just wanted to know, did anyone notice that Rich thought there was four inches of space  between the water and frozen?  Well, how much...  You don't think there's any space between the water?  You said it in such a way that you're a scientist, and you've done your experiments, and on the  average, there's four inches between the water and the ice. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, how much air do you think...  How much distance between the water and the ice?  I'd say...  Rich, the top layer freezes, so therefore...  It's like there shouldn't be any space.  For the most part, there shouldn't be any space.  There might be an air pocket somewhere, but not for interest.  There's air between...  But you said on the average, or like it's my studies have shown.  I think there is no space unless there's kind of an air bubble that forms somewhere, but  I really don't think there's space under there. 
[02:34:00]  Back to Starbucks.  Professor Rich, anything?  Yeah.  When you're between the bottom of the frozen ice, where the ice freezes...  Right.  Okay.  Then the water...  Where it freezes.  Where it freezes.  Say there's six inches of ice frozen.  Six inches of...  Six inches of ice frozen.  Frozen six inches of ice.  Why would there be a space?  Between the water...  Between the water and the ice.  And the bottom of the ice.  Because of expansion and a detraction and an expansion.  Holy fucking detraction and expansion. 
[02:34:30]  Detraction!  Or whatever the other fucking water is.  Oh my God.  With an R. You're off by a lot of letters.  Det.  Detraction?  You're at the wrong side of the alphabet.  Whatever.  How does the water...  That's what you think of my life.  You detract from it.  How does the last bit of water...  Wow.  ...that's frozen on...  Now you said six inches of ice, let's say.  I would say six.  Six.  How does that last bit on the bottom of that six inches get frozen if the water isn't even  touching it? 
[02:35:00]  Wait.  What?  Exactly.  Here's the thing.  When the ice freezes, the pond...  I don't know the scientific terms, but the ice will rise.  Wait.  Try.  Now the ice is going up.  It'll rise.  Kind of like heat.  Right.  Why don't you get any professor or anybody that knows?  Calm down.  Calm down.  Any professor.  Take a deep breath.  You're a scientist.  All right.  All right.  Explain yourself.  When the water freezes...  All right.  We got you there.  Because if there wasn't a space... 
[02:35:30]  What's the temperature of that water freezes at?  Well, wait a second.  Well, let's go with basics.  The temperature is...  The temperature is below 32 freezing.  Okay.  If it didn't...  It wasn't a space...  Yeah.  All the water would freeze.  No.  How come when it's only an inch of ice, how could it build to be six inches if the water  keeps pulling away from that block of ice?  How does it get bigger than a paper-thin slice of ice if right when the ice starts forming, 
[02:36:00]  it either rises from the water or the water goes away from it, regardless of what happens?  How does then more ice form when there is nothing but air touching the bottom of that  ice?  It's hard for me to explain this having an anxiety attack.  For about three hours now since I haven't slept last night, I'm having a major anxiety  attack.  Almost turning...  Pick some Xamix.  It's almost at a point of a panic attack.  Why?  I don't know. 
[02:36:30]  Why are you panicking?  I mean, you're intelligently explaining the way ice will just kind of rise off the lake  and give you a six feet of breathing room.  Listen.  Here's the thing.  Six feet.  All the...  Everything you know in this room...  Just say you saw it in True Lies at the beginning when Arnold jumped in and swam for a while  under the ice.  What movie did you see this in?  Yeah.  What movie?  What movie did you see this in?  What movie did you get your scientific...  Dr. Voss.  You know, every time you know something, someone might have told you, you might have seen it,  you might have read it, but you don't always know the theories behind it, you just know 
[02:37:00]  it, right?  Right.  An example of that would be what?  Uh...  Uh...  Like, you know, uh...  No.  Okay.  All right.  You know, you know right now...  You're a hell of a golfer, by the way.  No, here's the...  I just want to acknowledge that.  Here's the thing.  You know that certain types of food is good for you and bad for you, right?  Uh...  But you never went to school for nutrition, but you know...  But you know... 
[02:37:30]  Opie just spit fucking his breakfast out through his nose.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Not a word of it.  Because you heard...  You know...  Okay, when you go to the gym or you exercise, you know certain exercises are for certain parts  of the body.  You never took a course on training.  So you just know that ice pulls away from water.  I know...  Now, I think I know where Rich gets confused.  In the winter, when puddles form, in like the dirt or something, it'll ice over. 
[02:38:00]  And then since it's not a permanent body of water, that water absorbs into the ground  and leaves a layer of ice that's fun to like step in and go...  And crack.  You ever step on a thin layer of ice?  I think that's where Rich is getting confused.  How about this bottom of the ice surface melting because the water's a little warmer than the  ice?  Well, it would still be adding the water.  There.  That could be it.  But it would be adding the water back to the lake. 
[02:38:30]  Wait.  Here's the bottom line.  I'm right.  I just don't know why I'm right.  Okay.  Is that good enough?  No.  You know, if you're trying to bang a girl and you got all the right answers, that's all  that matters.  All I need is to look up at the phones and see science teacher, comma, Voss is an idiot.  Frank?  Frank from Chicago.  Nah, very familiar city with ice.  And you're a science teacher.  Yes, it's Ryan McClosse. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, Ryan.  Voss is an idiot.  It's not, there's no air between the water, frozen water, the ice and the frozen water  being ice.  First of all, you're 100% wrong because so many times kids fall into the ice, get sucked  under, and they hold their head up between the water and the ice and breathe until they're  pulled out.  What movie is this?  This just doesn't happen.  You see The Omen 2?  The Omen 2.  They grab an axe and try to get him out.  If a kid goes into the ice, he breaks through the ice, and isn't in the hole that he fell 
[02:39:30]  through and moves under the ice, he's a dead kid.  He is not, you find me one case where a kid fell through the ice, was washed down away from  the hole he fell through, and without any other fucking hole, he's breathing until help  comes or whatever.  There's no, the kid fucking drowns and is dead.  I could be wrong, but I don't think I am.  I'm pretty sure that, because I saw it somewhere where they hold their head up like that. 
[02:40:00]  In a movie.  It's called a movie.  Well, okay, even if it's a movie, to make the ice, you still have to have that separation  between it.  But that could be anything.  It could be air being released from the bottom somewhere and making a pocket.  There could be pockets.  And this science teacher, he had no proof.  He just goes, you're an idiot.  Where's his proof?  He's a science teacher.  The fact that the five million people listening agree with him.  My proof is this.  Yeah, five million people.  I didn't be wrong. 
[02:40:30]  Ryan.  No, my proof is this.  Jimmy, where are you performing on Thursday nights?  Chicago.  Oh, see?  Improv.  Chicago?  No, Chicago.  Zaney.  Zaney's in Chicago.  Oh, Zaney's in Chicago.  Zaney's in Chicago.  Zaney's in Chicago.  Zaney's in Chicago.  That's the important part.  Thank you, Ryan from Chicago.  Yeah, Ryan.  Chicago.  Ryan, do us a favor and listen to the show on WCKG, all right?  We can use the help.  I will do it.  All right, listen on WCKG, and then maybe listen to the second half, wink, wink, nudge, nudge  on XM Satellite Radio.  Do you understand what I'm saying, people? 
[02:41:00]  I've been doing it.  The Friday Pig Fatty, I showed some of the guys in my office here, and they're huge fans  already.  All right, cool.  They love the video.  All right, thank you, sir.  I'll see you.  All right, let's go to Eric, the trucker.  He does some ice fishing.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Josh, you're an idiot.  Oh, I guess I might be wrong on this one, too.  Anthony's right.  When you punch a hole in a lake or a pond, the water levels even with the top of the  ice.  I just got back last night from a three-day ice fishing trip.  So there's no space.  We go every year.  There's no space. 
[02:41:30]  There's no space.  Not even.  When you punch a hole in a lake or a pond, the water rises right to the top edge level  at the top of the ice.  There is no space.  Sir, what do you do to keep yourself from falling in?  Do you guys have a place you'll find on the ice that's really solid?  You should nail something in and tie a rope around that and then tie the other rope to  yourself so if you fall in, you only travel a little bit.  There are little, like, they make little cabins.  Yeah.  There are little cabins that they sit in.  They take drills, Jimmy.  The ice is really thick where they go ice fishing. 
[02:42:00]  They have fires in the cabins on the ice.  What are the cabins?  It's like a...  It's almost like an outhouse.  They're real small.  They make little outhouses.  And it's got no floor, or sometimes it's got a little bit of a floor with a hole in  it, and then you take an auger and drill a hole, and then you drop your lines, and then  you're ice fishing, and it's warm.  Drinking beer.  Some people bring TVs, and they make little fires in their area.  But what if you...  Like, if you fall through, like, you say you mischoculate horribly.  Jimmy, they drive trucks onto the ice.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I do believe people probably have fallen through. 
[02:42:30]  Idiots, they call them.  I'm sure maybe they do something like you're saying, just in case, but these ice fishermen,  they're driving their big, huge, you know, pickup trucks and stuff on the ice to set  up their little area for ice fishing.  How do you test it?  Test what?  It's in Minnesota.  The ice?  Oh, they know.  It's in these areas where the ice is just, you know, a couple feet thick for the entire  winter.  Someone said, with Rich's theory of that space, when the first person drills a hole  in the ice, all that air pressure that's between the water and the bottom of the ice 
[02:43:00]  would be released, and the ice would then slip down to the level of the water.  Like, you're releasing all that compressed air that's between the ice and the water.  Right.  All right.  So, this is one of the topics I won't talk about Saturday.  All right.  But here's the thing.  Oh, yeah.  Rich Voss is doing a show Saturday right here on 202.  Nice.  Yes.  Well, Rich and Bob, yeah.  I got to answer Bill from Philly.  Yes, it helped greatly.  Thank you, Bill.  Bill knows what to do.  Thank you, Bill Klein. 
[02:43:30]  Other people want to call Rich Voss an ass?  Ken in Jersey, what's up?  Ken, you there?  Jersey.  Voss is an ass.  He couldn't wait around to call you an ass.  Oh, well.  Let's go to Ed in South Dakota.  Ed, what's up?  I've fallen through the ice, and it was, I had waders on at the time, and the ice was  two inches above my waders, so that ice and cold water slowly poured into my waders. 
[02:44:00]  Poured into your waders.  Big hip booth things.  Yeah.  And filled up your legs with icy water, and now you're weighed down.  Now you're a lot heavier in the icy water.  As you try to pull yourself out, it's going to weigh you down.  I'm just pounding thinking about this.  Did you go completely under?  I had to break ice for about 20, no.  My chest and head were out of the water.  So you worked like an icebreaker and walked out?  Yep.  Making a swath of broken ice instead of trying to pull yourself out. 
[02:44:30]  How long did it take you?  15 minutes.  Did you completely think you were dead?  Oh, I thought I was a goner.  I was by myself, a mile from anything, nobody else around.  Did it go instantly, or did you hear that?  Start cracking?  Yeah, I got to hear a couple of cracks, and it popped.  And what did you just go, oh, fuck, I'm fucked.  Oh, that sucks.  Did you tip the waders?  Well, here's the first thing.  When I finally got on top of the ice, all the water and ice poured down the back of my neck, 
[02:45:00]  poured out of the waders and onto my head.  Oh, because you had to lift your legs up?  There was nothing I could do about it.  Right, right.  I had to lift my legs up, and I'm laying there.  Fortunately, it was about 40 degrees, so it wasn't terribly cold.  Wow.  Hey, someone from their cell phone, really fast, going with Rich's logic,  they're asking the question, so, puddles float in the air? 
[02:45:30]  Hmm.  It's too deep for me.  I don't know what it's like.  It's too hard, man.  You are brilliant as far as this radio show goes.  This team chick beating.  You are perfect.  Ed, that's...  Oh, there's the chick beating.  The news can't get enough of playing it and telling everyone how awful it is, but I've  seen it so...  I've seen this clip.  It has to be a dozen times this morning.  Is this racial?  Or, like, is it going white or black? 
[02:46:00]  No, I think there's a black girl also pops in, but white girls are hitting it.  It's nice to see the races working together.  They're working together.  It's a massive cat fight with hair pulling and kicking and punching.  There goes a black girl.  Oh, look at this.  Stopping a white...  You know what?  Three on one.  It's just...  They're just animals.  And the family's suing because some kid threw this up on YouTube.  Who's, uh...  Well, why did they beat up?  What's that poor little chubby...  They're suing the kids that put the video up on YouTube and not kids that...  Well, I'm sure they're suing the kids that beat their hair pulling.  Why are they beating her up?  Oh, look at them. 
[02:46:30]  I hope they get hit by cars.  Because it was Tuesday?  You know, why?  What do you mean they're animals?  This is just...  This shit happened all the time.  Let's not fucking think anything different.  But this shit always happened.  But this is one of the new rages as far as, you know, the YouTube videos go.  Well, I know, but...  It ends up on YouTube.  But we didn't always have video-capable cell phones and YouTube.  Right.  But beatings like this and shit always happen.  Every day. 
[02:47:00]  People, you know, chicks would beat the shit out of each other.  And guys would beat the shit out of each other.  And this would just go.  She would go home, cry to a mother.  The parents might get called.  Something would happen.  But now, you know, somebody grabs their camera phone.  It ends up on YouTube.  Yeah.  They can't stop showing on CNN.  No, they just showed it three times in a row.  Oh, nothing was better than seeing, like, two girls fight in high school.  Chick fights.  A cat fight out of nowhere.  Oh, great.  Everyone would just yell.  One of the greatest things to say.  Cat fight!  Cat fight! 
[02:47:30]  And you run out and just watch handfuls of hair and scratching.  The amount of hair they would pull out of each other's heads.  But black chicks used to box.  I mean, in my school, there were black chicks in my school that were so tough.  That's where the conversation ends for me.  There were black chicks in my school.  There weren't.  In Plainfield, let me tell you.  And these girls would throw down.  Like, you knew some could kick your ass.  Yeah.  So, like, you watched a fight, but you stayed away because you didn't want to.  What are you looking at?  You know, nothing.  What a coward. 
[02:48:00]  Not a coward.  These girls were tough in Plainfield.  I mean, my school, like high school and stuff, like three black kids, they were all in drama  class.  It was, you know, nothing to worry about.  But Central Islip, I went to Central Islip Elementary School.  So, again, a lot of them were younger.  It was before any real violence would perk up in anyone's head.  But there were a couple of big black guys in there that just used to come up and go,  Yo, man, give me 50 cent. 
[02:48:30]  Give me 50 cent.  And, you know, you dig in, give them a couple of quarters, smile, and walk away.  It was like paying a life toll.  When we, my school was mainly black.  One day we were walking home from school, and I knew all the dudes.  You know, I sold them pot, and I grew up in that neighborhood.  Good man.  So, I'm walking down the street with Mickey.  It's like 75, 80 degrees.  And one guy goes, Is that the guy that threw ice at us yesterday?  I go, Yeah.  Pow.  Blood just started pouring out of his face.  And they look at me, and they go, He's cool.  So, like, my friend is laying down. 
[02:49:00]  Why didn't you help him?  I did.  I carried him to the store to get the blood wiped off his face.  You should have stuck up for him and said, Hey.  And then throw some racial epithets.  No, I said he's cool.  I said he's cool.  He didn't throw ice.  And they just.  It's too late.  Bam.  You know, they were just, they used to carry.  This is in 70, like 73, 74.  They used to carry guns at school back then.  And, you know, and they would just terrorize you.  Like, one dude, Carlos, was just ruthless.  And he got, he was, we were in front of the store. 
[02:49:30]  He was standing in front of the store.  Just got out of jail.  And, and, and we go, What's up, Carlos?  He goes, the same old thing.  And you just had a hand on what you had in your pocket.  Like, the same old, I'm still taking your shit.  Oh, it was just like, no.  Just like old times.  Yeah, there were a couple of those guys.  That's what I'm talking about.  And you knew that, like, if they asked you for change, you didn't ask questions.  You didn't go like, hey, but I need that or something.  You just dug in your pocket and gave this kid.  It was Tyrone, his name was.  And you just gave him your 50 cents.  So every day, you had to make sure you had 50 cents on you above and beyond anything else 
[02:50:00]  that you wanted that day because 50 cents was going to him.  We were at a basketball game.  I remember.  Extortion.  I didn't get extorted, but there was a kid I wanted to be friends with named Billy.  He was older than me, Billy Archer.  And I was, like, in third, like, seventh grade.  He was, like, in eighth.  I thought he was cool.  And I remember one time he asked me, like, if I had a dime.  What if he asked me for a nickel?  Did you get a nickel?  And I gave him a dime.  And I'm like, you don't have to pay me back.  Like, I figured.  Oh, what a tool.  Hey, we got to back up just slightly. 
[02:50:30]  Rob in Cleveland.  Keep the change.  Easy come, easy go.  Easy go, Rob.  I had it, and I went with it.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say that Rich Voss is thinking of Sylvester Stallone and Cliffhanger  when he gets caught in the ice for, like, ten minutes.  Yeah, you're confusing fantasy world movie things with real life.  How did I know it wasn't real?  Because the credits at the end.  Yeah, really.  Because the guy that was the cliffhanger guy was also a boxer in a movie and a cop in another 
[02:51:00]  one and Rambo.  And he was really good at arm wrestling.  He played soccer once.  Still get, he was his mom.  Right.  We were at a basketball game in high school.  And, like, an 11th grader, the cops come in, handcuff him, and just take him out.  And as he's walking out, this 11th grader, he goes, call my moms, call my lawyer.  Who has a lawyer in 11th grade?  Oh, that is great.  I got a lawyer.  Call my moms, call my...  And then there was these dudes from the West. 
[02:51:30]  It was East End and West End.  And West End was really tough.  And there was this one dude, Earl.  If you owed him money, he was a gangster of gangsters.  If you owed him money, he would take you to Greenbrook Park, beat you up, take off all  your clothes, and make you swim and walk home.  And they would throw you in the lake after they beat you up and you had to walk home  naked.  So you always paid him for his drugs.  It was just ruthless, ruthless people.  It's not that ruthless, to be honest with you.  Ruthless?  Pay for your fucking drugs. 
[02:52:00]  I mean, Colombians kill your family and give you a necktie.  This guy just threw you in the lake.  Well, this is high school.  And they mail your...  Those are shenanigans.  And they mail your skull back to your family.  Hey, Doug from Jersey says, Plainfield High School is so much worse now.  Oh.  Rich, take this phone call.  I gotta take a leak.  All right.  Go ahead.  Doug.  Doug, you're on the air with Rich Voss.  Doug.  Yeah, here you go.  Hello?  It's John.  Whatever your fucking name is, just speak.  John.  Are you from Plainfield? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, I am.  And you go to Plainfield High?  Not anymore.  I graduated in 97.  Let me tell you what.  He ain't lying.  It's murder over there.  Wait, are you white or black?  White.  So you would be only...  Well, no, because if the black people...  Wait a minute.  If the black guys from Plainfield sounded like this, it's not a tough school.  Well, there's always one that's a Republican.  No, there isn't.  Now you like...  There were three white kids in my graduating class, and we got beat up almost every day. 
[02:53:00]  And there was only three graduates that year.  Were the black kids racial to you?  Yeah.  They used to make us wear white t-shirts.  It was horrible.  Now, you lived in the East End or the West End?  East End.  See, was the West End as brutal as anywhere?  It's like a combat zone, right?  Oh, yeah.  You go anywhere near Greenbrook Park, you were getting robbed, shot, stabbed.  Unbelievable.  It was like this in the 70s, but it's got to be brutal now.  I mean, the school is just... 
[02:53:30]  Well, even then, like you were saying that they would bring guns to school.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Then, though, a lot of it was solved by just punching...  You know, black guy asked for money in the school I'm talking about, Francis J. O'Neill Elementary School.  If you didn't give them the money, you would be punched in the face.  But that's it, you know?  Now, you look at somebody the wrong way, you step on someone's foot,  and don't fucking beg for forgiveness.  You get stabbed or shot in the bathroom or something like that.  God forbid you put a mark on someone's new sneakers. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, oh, boy.  And they must have tons of security guards in the school now, right?  Oh, yeah.  Metal techers and everything.  They just shave down plastic and carry plastic blades.  Oh, jeez.  You know the heater by the...  I guess it's over by Stell Avenue, outside the heater out there.  The heater?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's where you used to cut school.  Instead of going to class in this type of weather, I would just stand under the heater,  that blue heater out, smoke pot, and sell nickel bags to the black dudes that walk by. 
[02:54:30]  There was a heater outside?  It was a vent that blew heat out.  How did everybody not know that everybody was selling drugs by that nice warm spot outside?  Yeah, that's where you went and caught the heater.  And no school official did anything?  There wasn't as many back then.  Security guards, there was like two when I was in the house.  They don't do anything now.  They're just happy they survived the week.  And there's got to be gas.  We've got another paycheck.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  Is it like Crips and Bloods now in Plainfield? 
[02:55:00]  Some real, some fake.  It's crazy.  Who we, by the way, as the Opie and Anthony show, have no preference.  Neither.  Either is fine by us.  I think they're just getting together as friends and just whatever they have to do.  All right, Doug.  Way to be PC, boys.  Take it easy.  All right, listen.  We've got Sean from Michigan.  We really want to move on because we've got Dede's basement.  We wanted to play that today.  We wanted to hear a little of that.  We got this cereal buttocks grabber from Florida. 
[02:55:30]  We got news bloopers.  I found Borat's acceptance speech from the Golden Globe.  This thing was hilarious.  We want to play one more.  It's Beyond Funny, I think.  But first, we got Sean of Michigan.  So that means it's not funny.  It overshot the runway of funny.  I guess you're right.  I guess you're right, yeah.  You know, there is a six-inch gap between funny and Beyond Funny.  It lives somewhere in there.  Oh, okay.  It's hovering over funny.  If you drilled a hole in Beyond Funny, would there be a gap before you got to funny? 
[02:56:00]  Because I know Beyond Funny seems to lift up a bit.  But you have to go through mundane to get some funny, I guess.  Yeah.  Did he make the speech as Cullen or as Borat?  As Cullen.  Okay.  That's good.  Let me ask.  I'm glad he didn't.  Let's say hi to Sean in Michigan.  Sean?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right.  You know, Rich is right in a little way.  He doesn't know why he's right, though.  All right.  Northern Michigan is cold all the time.  If you're on a lake that doesn't change levels very often, no, you're not going to have a gap. 
[02:56:30]  But if it's a reservoir and they can control the level of that water, you're damn right.  You drill through that ice.  And I've done this when my truck's been on the ice.  You drill through and air comes up and you go, shit, and you get the hell off the lake.  Yeah.  See, that's what I meant.  Michigan.  I forgot to leave out Michigan.  Oh, Michigan.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, a reservoir, yeah, I guess the level might change.  It does.  It does.  It changes a lot if that ice is thick enough, man.  The ice stays where it is in the center. 
[02:57:00]  And, of course, it hits the sides of the lake if it's a smaller reservoir.  Man, you drill through and nothing but air comes out, get the hell off.  And that's what I'm saying.  Anything with a current under the ice, the level will drop.  No, not necessarily river.  The river ain't going to do that.  Well, yeah, yeah, it won't.  You know, if they can regulate the level of that water, be careful on a reservoir, man.  Can we finish up the fluid dynamics with Professor Voss, second to the program? 
[02:57:30]  Before we lose every single listener out there.  He was right.  He just didn't know why.  As we speak, people are falling through the ice, the thin ice that is called this radio show.  Falling to other stations that are six inches below our show.  Right, my God.  We might have to kill someone to get everyone back listening to this program, Rich.  Seems to work if you could ride it out.  Jesus.  Yeah, MSNBC just did a huge story on the morning rave being fired.  All right, should we take a break and then get into this other stuff? 
[02:58:00]  Let's do that.  And I want to hear...  Sasha?  Sasha.  Okay.  And the cereal buttocks?  The cereal buttocks thing I've heard nothing about.  Oh, that sounds cute.  DD's Basement.  I might not even want to hear that crap.  News Bloopers is a quickie and...  What?  Jim Norton, 1993 Governor's set.  No, stop.  Holy shit, come on.  You've got to do that with Patrice and Colin here.  If they have...  If that's the same one we did at NEW, that's not the one I was going to bring. 
[02:58:30]  That Governor's set, that's not a...  Yeah, I thought you were bringing in a new one.  I forgot today, but that's from a TV.  That's probably the Rascal set.  Here, well, whoever brought this in, come on in and explain yourself.  And explain yourself so you can get beaten.  It's not like Jimmy is trying to get out of it.  No.  But he would rather have...  A lot better audio.  He wants crystal clear audio.  All right, we're going to regroup.  We'll continue in just a bit with Rich Voss, who's doing a show on 202 this Saturday with  his lovely wife, Bonnie, right?  9 to 12.  All right.  All right, we're going to officially start the XM portion of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:59:00]  Now that the walkover is over and the bullshitting with Rich Voss is done, no more ice talk, all 
[02:59:30]  right, Rich?  Promise us.  Oh, I'm done.  All right.  Will you be taking science questions on Saturday?  I don't think that's going to work.  I'm going to try to set you up to fail.  If you're going to listen to Rich Voss on Saturday on 202, you know, ask him a science question,  all right?  All right.  What were you going to say before break?  Do I think what?  Were you going to smash me?  No, just do you think.  That's what I said.  Do you think?  That was the joke. 
[03:00:00]  Very good, Anthony.  Yeah, Borat's acceptance speech from the Golden Globes.  Oh, that was it.  Sasha.  And you just saw the movie for the first time very recently.  Yeah, recently, and I was a little bummed that I didn't see it sooner.  And what part did you really, really like?  I thought the part where he has to stay at the Jewish people's house was hysterical.  Was that your favorite part or the funny part?  That was probably my favorite part because it was just so politically incorrect and wrong. 
[03:00:30]  Then the other thing was the disgusting favorite part, which I don't know how the hell he...  All right, because that was my favorite part.  And that was way more wrong than any other scene in the movie.  When he thought that the Jews had the power to shapeshift and had shapeshifted into cockroaches and crawled under his bedroom door,  and he was fending them off by throwing money at the cockroaches.  I found that hysterical. 
[03:01:00]  Better than the balls and the asshole in his face.  No, that was funny in one of the most disgusting ways I've ever laughed.  There's never been a more disgusting scene filmed.  A fat, hairy man.  He goes 300 pounds.  Yeah, 300 plus.  His face is sitting on Sasha's face.  Yeah.  And his balls and asshole is right in his face.  His face is buried in this guy's taint and ass crack. 
[03:01:30]  And I'm like, this is a cheap budget movie.  This isn't CGI.  They didn't green screen this guy into this guy's fucking asshole.  Who was the guy wearing?  Nothing.  They were both completely naked.  They're both completely naked.  And this fat, hairy man buried.  You can't imagine how far up Borat's face was in this guy's ass crack.  Oh, he can imagine.  Why?  Yeah.  They were fighting.  They were fighting in a hotel room. 
[03:02:00]  And they were completely naked.  And then the fight spilled out to the hallway, the elevator.  And then they ran into some kind of like a convention.  Like a real estate convention or something that was happening at the hotel.  Now they're chasing each other.  They're chasing each other through the convention fighting completely naked.  How come you haven't seen this movie yet?  Why?  It's worth seeing, dude.  It's funny.  It really is.  You don't think the part with the lady, the woman libs, where he was sitting being interviewed?  Oh, yeah.  Just pissing off the women libers.  The woman libs?  Yeah.  The women libs? 
[03:02:30]  You know what I'm saying.  The women libs.  The women's liberation movement.  The women ad libs.  Hey, Boots from Jersey.  Hey, boys.  Two things.  Ask Voss what temperature water freezes.  He said 32 below?  No, 32 below 32.  He said below 32.  I said below.  It could also freeze at 32.  That's technical.  Yeah, all right.  I wouldn't call it that one degree.  And then he also writes, and I believe Opie referred to Colombians emailing a skull to the family.  Oh, email.  And then he just writes, brilliant. 
[03:03:00]  That would be scary.  Ooh, it's an email from some Colombians.  Ooh, it's a skull.  Pop up.  Necktie.com.  Let's go to Jonathan in Jersey.  Jonathan, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Jonathan.  Just calling to let Anthony know that I think he's missing the whole point of the whole Borat movie.  Funny movie.  But, you know, making fun of the Jews, making fun of the women.  And he's kind of making fun of the other countries, the smaller countries in the world. 
[03:03:30]  Really?  How ignorant they are.  I didn't even fucking get that.  I just thought it was like a candid camera movie.  I didn't get the irony or anything.  Because I'm a fucking retard, Jonathan.  Thanks for filling me in.  I love you guys in Jersey.  Thank you.  I'm from Long Island.  I'm stupid, too, Jonathan.  All right.  Well, with that...  What an idiot.  He's not getting away with that.  Whatever.  Of course I saw that and I knew what the fuck the movie's about. 
[03:04:00]  Jesus Christ.  Well, maybe he helped me.  Oh, okay.  All right.  With that said, here's Borat accepting his Golden Globe the other night.  Actually, Sasha.  Warren?  Where is he?  It's...  Wa-wa-wee-wa!  I want to thank the Hollywood Foreign Press.  And I just want to say, this movie was a life-changing experience.  I saw some amazing, beautiful, invigorating parts of America. 
[03:04:30]  But I saw some dark parts of America.  An ugly side of America.  A side of America that rarely sees the light of day.  Who's this guy?  I refer, of course, to the anus and testicles of my co-star, Ken DeViscian.  Wait there.  Wow.  And you can say anus and testicles on primetime television?  As long as you don't talk about shoving your testicles in the man's anus. 
[03:05:00]  Really?  Well, listen...  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You tell me how he got away with this.  Was this network?  And I bet you we couldn't play this on the other side of the Opie and Anthony show today.  Oh, they're loving them.  Ken, as I...  When I was in that scene, 
[03:05:30]  and I stared down  and saw your two wrinkled golden globes on my chin,  I thought to myself,  I'd better win a bloody award for this.  And then when my 300-pound co-star decided to sit on my face  and squeeze the oxygen from my lungs, 
[03:06:00]  I was faced with a choice.  Death  or to breathe in the air.  To breathe in the air  that had been trapped in a small pocket  between his buttocks for 30 years.  Kenneth, 
[03:06:30]  if it was not for that rancid bubble,  I would not be here today.  Thank you to Larry Jones.  Thank you to Jay Roach.  And then, you know, whatever.  And then they gave him the music, huh?  Wow.  They gave him the get-the-fuck-out-of-here music.  How the hell did he get away with that?  Yep.  He talked around it, sure,  but come on.  Yes. 
[03:07:00]  Balls on the chin, pretty much.  Yeah, ball on the chin.  Asshole in your ass.  Yeah, nose in your ass.  By the way,  something very funny happened  while that clip was playing.  Voss was attempting to eat,  what, a bagel or something?  A bran muffin.  A bran muffin.  Oh, no.  And he had it all laid out nice in front of him.  And maybe you heard in the background  as you're listening to that clip,  this sound.  That was Norton's fist  pummeling the muffin  in front of Rich Voss.  Why did I miss that?  I just gently pulled it back  and pushed it.  Do they get to see that on Pal Talk? 
[03:07:30]  Let me see the muffin.  I fucking love when he does that.  Do they get to see that on Pal Talk?  Oh, I don't even know.  I couldn't stand up  because he was home.  I hope so.  All right.  Is it still a flat?  Look, I can kind of see.  It looks like an English muffin now.  It looks like a toasted English muffin.  He's the most anal person  when you mess with his food.  He's a scumbag.  He'll yell and scream at you.  I was still going to eat it.  Were you?  No.  Laying it out all nice, getting ready.  I look forward to that. 
[03:08:00]  Yes, I know.  I can see.  I earned that muffin.  It was farting on it.  It was still on it?  It was six inches  between his hand and that muffin.  That is really funny.  Perfectly good.  Soft muffin.  All right.  What did he win for?  Best comedy or best comedy actor?  Yeah, exactly.  Best comedy.  He won for best drama.  Yeah, right.  What the fuck did he? 
[03:08:30]  Best special effects.  No, I'm answering him like,  yeah, you know, that was,  yeah, you're right on that one.  Of course.  Here's the thing.  Best lighting.  Best adapted screenplay.  Best actress.  The Golden Globes.  Best costume.  Here's the thing.  The Golden Globes is a key  to who might win the Oscars.  Is it?  Hi, we're the king.  Oh, I hate this fat cunt.  Not Duke.  Why?  Who is that?  She was on American Idol last night. 
[03:09:00]  Ew.  Big, fat, like,  you could tell she's the life of the party.  Everyone loves her at the office.  She's the funny one.  No, not even that.  She's just a fun, fat friend.  Yeah, fun, fat friend.  And she came in to American Idol to audition  and sang what she thought sounded like  the Cowardly Lion.  You know what a fun,  that's not a fun, fat friend.  You know what a fun, fat friend does?  Oh, what, Jim?  When you're out at a restaurant  and you go,  all right, do that thing I like.  And they go, yeah? 
[03:09:30]  And you go, yeah.  And they take off their clothes  and they crawl around on the restaurant floor  and make piggy noises.  That is a fun, fat friend.  All people are eating.  And you get to throw  pats of butter on her ass.  If I were the king  of a boss  not queen  not duke  not prince  or my regal ropes  of a forest  would be a satin 
[03:10:00]  not cotton  not chintz  I command everything  be a fish  or fall with a wolf  and a royal girl  Oh, fuck.  Cowardly elephant.  Well, Simon,  any comments?  But what am I supposed to say?  I'm unique.  I am like  the most different 
[03:10:30]  that has ever been on the show.  I have something  that no one can bring  and I have like range that  It was one of the strangest  auditions I've ever heard  in my life.  That's a yes or no?  No.  Paula?  No.  Jewel?  No.  I snowed Hollywood.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Do you guys want the poster?  Not really.  No.  She made a poster for them.  I'm going to wait for the tin man.  I'm going to call the tin man  right now.  There you go.  I like the fact though  that Simon didn't play into it 
[03:11:00]  and give her fun.  He just went to a strange audition.  No?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Done.  Leave.  Out.  Fatso.  Yeah.  You're a little gimmick.  Exactly.  Hey, you guys were talking  about Jason the juggler.  I didn't get to see Jason  because I went to bed.  I saw it.  I made it to around 930.  He had those dopey sticks.  You ever see the sticks?  There's two sticks.  A total of three.  Two sticks you hold.  I'm sorry.  I interrupted you too much  on the show.  I understand.  But on the instant feedback  it's perfect.  Bert from Philly.  She's singing. 
[03:11:30]  Oh yeah.  Sorry, Ant.  Anyway.  I was the king of the  Francus.  That's the line.  Anyway, so there's the sticks.  Yeah, the three sticks.  You hold two of them  and one of them  you bang around  and it flips around  and you kind of  keep it in the air  with the other two sticks.  Some lame fucking...  It's a hippie sport.  Yeah.  They're called devil sticks.  Devil sticks, man.  What happened to the hacky sack? 
[03:12:00]  Devil sticks.  I got my devil sticks  and my fish tapes, man.  So he went in to audition  and he's flipping around  you know, his stick  and he's singing  but not really.  He's just kind of  talking his way  through something  and it's awful.  And he walks out of there  so upset and pissed off  that he didn't get picked.  Like, there's no way  you would pick this guy  for anything.  And you were at the cellar  laughing even though  you weren't listening 
[03:12:30]  to the sound?  Yeah, at the cellar  they have the TVs up  and the bar  and you can kind of  read the printout.  What's it called?  The closed caption.  Yeah.  And it was...  I don't know why  it made me laugh  because he was crying so hard  and they just go to Simon  and you can see  he took that well  and I don't know why  it just made me laugh.  I just knew they must have  shit on him  and I missed it.  Oh yeah, they did.  Froncus.  Froncus.  Well, Jason was here  with his props.  I'm counting every moment  I'm biding all my time  I'm standing out here 
[03:13:00]  on my own  I'm searching for that someone  to heal this heart of mine  and keep me from being alone  But when will it be?  And how will I know  I don't want to wait here forever  Somebody want me  The way I've always dreamed  it could be  All right, Jason.  You have just summed up  Minneapolis, mate. 
[03:13:30]  Mm-hmm.  That just sums up the day.  Useless at everything.  I mean, even the juggling  was pathetic.  No, I can actually juggle  really well if you want me.  All right, let's see  the real juggling.  All right, Jason.  All right.  He dropped one.  You know, I've got to say  something here.  I mean, Paula.  Yeah?  How can I feel  Jason happen  into the wrong show?  I was going to just say that.  Maybe he should be  There's a show, Paula,  have you heard of it?  Jewel is called  America's Got Some Talent? 
[03:14:00]  Okay.  All right, all right, all right.  Randy, yes or no?  No for Idol.  Yes for America's Got Talent  if I should be so bold.  No.  Jewel.  No.  Paula.  Definitely America's Got Talent.  It's a note.  Sorry.  Your future involves  not singing.  So then what happened?  Uh, then he walks out  and he loses his mind.  Well, how old is he?  16.  He's like 16.  Is there a golden ticket  in your boy's hand  who's never sung for you before? 
[03:14:30]  them.  Oh, shit.  Son of a bitch  cut me off.  They said I couldn't sing.  They said I was perfect  for juggling,  could dance.  Paula, oh my God,  she was just so  drugged out.  in her face from me.  I could tell  they ate me.  They were on the...  God, I tried to fuck back  and everything.  They were so insulted  in my life.  They said I sum up  Minneapolis.  They say Minneapolis  has no talent  because of me.  That made me laugh. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, shit.  No way.  No.  Why don't you  worry about it?  16 years old.  Jason, you're 16.  You got a lot.  16 years old.  I wanted to start out famous.  They blew me off.  You'll be famous.  You're going to be famous.  That's what it's about today.  Okay.  You're going to be famous.  He's a douche.  He's going to fucking  kill his high school.  So you have no problem  with that?  You get to be famous.  No, no, no.  You have no problem  with that crime,  but you had a problem  with Jessica crying.  There was to me  a real sadness in her. 
[03:15:30]  That started off the show  last night.  Okay.  To me, there's a real sadness  in that this kid was a little bit  to me spoiled and obnoxious.  Reparted.  That seems obnoxious to me.  Yeah.  Like to be juggling  and it's like,  at least the other girl,  the audio I really didn't hear  because I took the headphones off.  Wow, it disturbed you.  Jimmy could not handle it.  I couldn't take it.  No, I took him off.  Plus, he's a prop act.  Everybody knows  American Idol is for singing.  Nobody's coming there  and juggling  and doing magic tricks.  No.  That's to get you in the door. 
[03:16:00]  They're doing little things  to get the attention  of the jokes.  I got to play.  It's a little long  but this was my favorite part  of American Idol last night.  The girl that I was trying  to figure out,  work out the song  Kiss by Prince.  Yeah.  Live in front of him.  If you show up,  perhaps you should know  the words to the song you're doing.  Did you hear this?  I'm sure she just forgot them.  Oh, she was the best.  But she forgot all of them.  She got nervous.  She blacked out.  But she stayed focused  and just hung in there.  She got scared.  And you at home,  you're waiting for her 
[03:16:30]  to just get to the hook  which is I just want your  and your kiss.  Is that all you want to hear?  No.  No.  But she was singing that song.  Is that the one that danced  on the floor and stuff?  She was snapping a lot.  Yeah.  Snapping her fingers  and dancing.  It gets funnier  as it goes along.  Women, no girls.  I want no women,  no girls.  I want women, 
[03:17:00]  not no girls.  I want women,  not no girls.  Oh, my God.  I'm so f***ed.  But she's hanging in there.  She's working it out.  Women, not girls.  They rule my world.  Yes.  They rule my world.  God.  Oh, my God.  I was actually rooting  for her last night.  Like, come on.  You can do it.  They rule my world.  Yes, they rule my world.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Don't need shoes  and time.  They've got to be  what I'm saying.  So uncomfortable.  Just whispering.  No women,  I want girls.  I don't want no girls  because they rule my world.  Yeah.  Women,  because she rule my world.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  How'd she snap her fingers  with no thumb?  It's like hearing somebody 
[03:18:00]  trying to sing along  with the radio  without the radio.  You know,  just get quiet  in the books  you don't know.  Yeah, when you don't know  and just...  She was dancing  and moving  and trying to cover up  for the fact  that she did  in other words.  She was just trying  to work it out, man.  She knew she...  I know this song.  I know it.  I know this.  I know it.  I sing it on the radio  when it's in the car.  I know it.  We're not even halfway done.  It's so uncomfortable.  And I'm at home going,  come on,  you can do it.  You can do it.  You can do it.  You can do it.  I know you're going 
[03:18:30]  to get to the hook.  Listen.  Women,  because she proved  my world.  Oh, God.  I'm going to women  because they proved  at your age  and not your shoe size.  At your age  and not your shoe size.  And then I'm doing  a twirl.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You don't need  to watch Dynasty. 
[03:19:00]  Right here.  I'm like,  all right,  she's got it.  To have an attitude.  All right,  here she goes.  All right.  Yeah.  I just want you to trust.  I just...  Hey, you know.  You just want Dynasty.  No.  To have an attitude.  You don't have to be rich  to be my girl.  You don't have to be cool  to rule my world.  I'm not... 
[03:19:30]  You don't have to be rich  to rule my world.  You don't have to be cool  to be my girl.  Ain't no particular sound  that I'm in doubt compatible with.  I just want your extra time  and your...  Yes.  And then she did  a big finish, yeah.  You had a...  Your fate when you...  Oh.  Ah.  Randy, yes or no?  Uh, no. 
[03:20:00]  Singing's not your thing, baby.  Yes.  Jewel?  Nope.  Yes.  Paula?  No for me.  Why don't you keep saying yes?  I just like to hear it.  You're not going to hear it for me?  Okay.  Honestly, sorry.  I do apologize.  Don't apologize.  Thank you.  It was like, you know,  you're in your car  and the battery,  you like get the car started  and you're like,  all right, cool.  And then it dies again.  Like, oh.  And it just keeps  starting up and dying,  starting up and dying. 
[03:20:30]  Jewel seems a little cunty.  She doesn't say anything,  you know?  She was kind of...  Yeah.  Well, she didn't say much  when she didn't like somebody.  She was just kind of like,  no, no, no thanks, man.  She could afford to be cunty, I guess.  I bet you Simon likes to be spanked  and strap-on fuck.  Wow.  Because he's so dominant.  I'll bet you that he's a little bitch in bed.  I bet you he likes to, like,  have feet put in his face  while he...  No, he didn't put them in my face.  No.  And the girls put their feet in his face.  Yeah.  Make them smell their pits.  When she was singing, 
[03:21:00]  their faces were...  If you saw My Cousin Vinny  when the stuttering lawyer talked  and the jury's faces were just stunned,  that's what Simon was sitting there going,  I can't believe this is happening.  I was a very 20-year-old movie.  I'm trying to think.  And Rocker Josh,  is it worth playing?  I don't know.  I didn't stay up late enough  for Rocker Josh either.  He was the one that...  He left after her.  They told him to go sing an Abba song?  Yeah, he...  Is this worth playing, though? 
[03:21:30]  He was...  Was this kid Josh.  He looked like he should have been  in a boy band.  He had the look.  And when he walked in,  you could tell, like,  Simon looks at him,  kind of gave him the up and down  and was like,  all right,  he's got the look  that American girls will, like, vote for.  Let's see what he can do.  But he's talking about  how he's a rocker.  And so they were expecting  something else to come out of this kid.  And his voice is just ridiculous.  Yeah. 
[03:22:00]  And it's kind of a one-trick pony thing.  So they said,  what's going to happen  on week six or something  when we do Abba?  He goes,  I'll do that  and I'll do my own style.  So he goes,  okay, go out,  get an Abba song together  in 15 minutes  and then come back and sing it.  And now it's worth playing  because now it means something.  Yeah.  Come in.  All right, your name is?  Josh.  Josh, why are you here?  I'm here to be  the next American Idol, basically.  I don't know,  Chris opened some doors last year  and I figured I'd just give it a shot.  All right, Josh. 
[03:22:30]  And what are you going to sing?  I'm going to sing  Bad Day by Fuel.  Okay, off you go.  I had a bad day again.  She said I would not understand.  She left a note and said,  I'm sorry, I've had a bad day again.  She spilled a coffee, broke her shoelace.  She smeared the lipstick on her face. 
[03:23:00]  She slammed the door and said,  I'm sorry, I've had a bad day again.  Thank you, Josh.  Wow.  Had a bad audition.  Yeah, that was it.  That was his voice.  And it was coming out of someone  that looked like our own young Travis  holding a cat.  He was a very young,  young, fresh-faced boy. 
[03:23:30]  Smooth as a, what was it today?  A hen's egg?  A hen's egg.  Smooth as a hen's egg.  Smooth as a hen's egg.  As masculine as a hen.  And he's trying to, you know,  have this rocker voice and attitude  and it just was,  did not look right.  It looked like somebody was dubbing his voice.  His rocker voice isn't that good.  Yeah.  He's got that rasp thing  that looks like he'd blow out his voice  in a week.  And they challenged him on it,  on the fact that, you know,  can you do anything else?  You're not that versatile. 
[03:24:00]  Okay.  And then he started playing other things.  And when he did the Abba thing,  they go,  I bet everything you sing sounds like that.  And he goes,  no, you know.  Do you have that clip?  Yeah, we got that Abba.  But we got to give Va some credit here.  Let's go to Charlie in North Carolina.  Charlie.  Charles.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Charlie.  Boss had a great line  when the girl was screwing up the kiss song  that everyone missed.  What?  He asked how she could snap  without any thumbs.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, trust me.  We heard it.  We're like,  we realized we filled our black quota 
[03:24:30]  like hours ago.  Exactly.  No, that was a great line.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Here's Abba.  Okay.  So the theme is Abba Week.  What have you chosen?  You can dance.  You can shine.  Having the time of your life.  Ooh, see that girl.  Watch that scene.  She is a dancing queen.  Okay, so basically 
[03:25:00]  every week  we're going to get that voice.  I can do like  a Barry Manilow  or something if you want.  Okay.  Yeah?  Her name was Lola.  She was a showgirl.  Oh, I'm getting laughing.  No, no, no.  I'm not laughing.  I said every week  we're going to get that voice  and you went no  and you just did it.  Well, I'm a little worried  that your throat's going to get hurt  if you keep pushing that hard.  I've been singing in my band 
[03:25:30]  like every day.  Oh, so you're in a band?  Yeah, oh, yeah.  I'm in a band.  So years and years  and gigs and gigs  and my voice has never gone off.  And so you write?  Do you write?  Yeah, I write all my songs.  I'd say stick with that.  I'm not singing.  Yeah, I would say stick with that  with the band, dude.  Yeah, I think what we're saying  is it's a little one-dimensional, this.  It is a bit.  All right, Randy, yes or no?  I still say no.  I think you're better in your band  and I think you're better  to be with the band.  I don't see you as a solo star like that.  It's not what I see.  Yeah, I'd say stay in a rock band.  Don't be discouraged.  All singers like you're in bands. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Paula?  I'm about to pass.  It's a no.  But I've got to tell you, Josh,  in a year's time,  you will thank us  for not putting you through this round.  Exactly.  I promise you.  Why?  I don't know.  Why would he thank them?  You would get the TV exposure.  He would look like a complete ass  trying to sing the songs  that they make these other people sing.  At least he could have plugged  what garage he's going to be at next week.  I know.  He's like, no, stick with your band.  You know, it's just a bunch of 16-year-olds 
[03:26:30]  jamming badly in someone's garage.  He sounds like a sober Tom Waits.  And here is Josh reacting.  I really did think Chris kicked open a door  for a lot of people.  Apparently, not for me.  So, people always say there's always next year,  but nothing about my voice is going to change.  I'm not going to change who I am by any means.  So...  Yeah, there was a lot of crying last night.  You're a rock band.  Tough it up, faggot. 
[03:27:00]  I know.  Jesus Christ.  Tough it up, kid.  What's his guitarist going to say to him?  Do some heroin and tough it up.  And he gets down to practice.  Right.  Dude, we got to get a new singer.  You were crying on television.  Faggot.  After singing an ABBA song.  How much fucking rock credibility do we have left?  You're out of the band.  He's getting kicked out of the band.  He launched it and her name was Lola.  What a good girl.  Yeah.  You couldn't sing Nirvana, you jerk.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Sing something fitting.  Yeah.  You cuddled mud?  I mean, come on. 
[03:27:30]  National TV.  Obviously, you didn't see the Dyson review on Arsenio.  It can ruin you.  What?  That was 25 years ago.  I don't know.  I'm trying to get the references.  You know what?  I'm just trying to be a little hip.  You're an older gentleman, Rich.  Hip.  Hip for 1987.  I know.  You sound like you've just broken one.  Opie and Anthony, this ain't your mama's radio show.  Bitch.  Do you understand that nobody likes you? 
[03:28:00]  What the hell is this?  What is this?  I don't know.  Emo?  What music is this?  Is it some emo shit?  A little emo-ish.  Is it emo?  Bill?  Bill?  I don't know.  It was just in the rejoiners folder.  Hello, Bill.  And, of course, trying to find out who's responsible for putting that in the rejoiners thing would be a futile effort. 
[03:28:30]  We'll delete that one.  Yeah.  How about you just delete that?  That's a little faggy for a rejoiner for this program.  We're rockers, man.  We rock.  I'll say we do.  Right?  Paperback writer.  Get that in there.  Right, Rich?  I've got some best.  Why doesn't Lynch go out for Idol?  He's got a good voice.  Right?  He's got that good voice.  Because he's 45.  I was going to say, because he's an older man.  He's an alcoholic.  I believe if you've been paid to sing on Broadway, you're not allowed to, you know, maybe go in there as an amateur contest. 
[03:29:00]  He would probably do pretty well.  I mean, if he was just...  Yeah, he's got a great voice.  He does.  But, yeah, I don't think he'd fit the age requirement anymore.  Am I not talking to the mic?  Yes, sir.  People are saying you're low today.  Am I?  I turned you up a bit.  Low.  A problem solver's alert about a man wanted for grabbing women's back signs at local stores.  The Seminole County Sheriff's Office says several women, in fact, have complained of unwanted touching at the Publix and a Target on West Lake Mary Boulevard. 
[03:29:30]  As soon as we get our hands on a sketch of the suspect or we get some surveillance video, we'll, of course, show it to you so that you can be forewarned.  So you can see a man grabbing a woman's ass.  I think it's funny.  It's Seminole County.  Seminole.  Seminole fluid County.  How about a Target?  Did it?  Does anybody remember Lassie? 
[03:30:00]  What is that?  Oh, exactly.  What does that mean?  What?  Target?  That's what happened at Target.  Like her ass is the Target?  Wow.  Come on.  I've had some great lines say, you make one little dumb line and you guys will turn it into a documentary.  I'm surprised there's not a fucking Bravo film crew behind me now because of that one line.  No, dickhole.  Where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  Shut the goddamn ass! 
[03:30:30]  What?  Target?  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass.  Target.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Alright.  Well, that was terrific.  Trying to think of appropriate funny store names. 
[03:31:00]  There are none.  No.  The whole store thing.  As soon as he said, I'm like, alright, store, store.  That might make sense here.  Yes.  How about buns and noble?  Maybe he was in Siemens.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Rich.  There's two.  A and S?  Huh?  Alright.  Are there even A and S's around anymore? 
[03:31:30]  Who knows?  Rich is going to do it.  Go ahead.  Alright, Rich.  Maybe it was a Jiffy Lube.  I could do this all day.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  It's my Jiffy Lube.  I hate you.  Someone's suggesting Starbuts.  There you go, Starbuts.  How about Bunkin Donuts?  Well, it's been a while. 
[03:32:00]  Rears and Roebuck.  And go.  And go.  Oh, God damn it.  What a target.  Work off Toys R Us.  There might be something there.  Oh.  No.  That's a tough one.  Well, who was he grabbing? 
[03:32:30]  Boys R Us?  I got nothing.  You haven't even worked your way up to nothing yet.  I kill in clubs.  Killing clubs.  No doubt.  I will never deny that, by the way.  Kill.  I don't want to confuse the issue.  Rich kills in comedy clubs.  And I kill on the radio, too, in a different way.  But not the way you would like to kill on the radio.  Our own listeners are helping out.  They are?  Home Deep Hole. 
[03:33:00]  Rear One Imports.  How about Rapels?  The lady needed a Bed Bath and Beyond Waka Waka from Chester's Liver.  Or Bed Bath and Behind.  Behind.  That's the joke.  How about JC Penis?  Best but.  Brian from Buffalo.  Sam Ass.  How about Dan from Pottstown, Pennsylvania? 
[03:33:30]  Askin Robbins.  JC Pussies.  There you go.  He's grabbing it from the front.  No.  Well, let's go to Axe in Maine.  Axe, what's up?  Yeah, how about Pimper Crombie and Bitch?  Instead of Abercrombie and Bitch?  We got him.  Oh, God.  Really?  We thought it was instead of TJ Maxx.  Right.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:34:00]  Instead of Abercrombie.  You know?  Instead of Abercrombie and Bitch?  Like, that was going to make it better.  You know, instead of JC Crew.  What?  Oh, I got a little fire on my stove.  Let me throw some gas on it.  Wow.  Dick's Sporting Goods?  If it's any consolation, people are having a hard time coming up with anything funny.  What about Dwayne Rear from Billy H in Queens? 
[03:34:30]  It's a tough one.  Yeah, it's a tough one.  All right, well.  All right.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max?  Morning, boy.  Hi.  Hey, Max.  How about Bed, Butt, and Beyond?  Punching out.  No.  Well, no.  All right.  End of pit.  It's not funny anymore.  It wasn't even to begin with to be honest.  No.  Terrible all the way through.  Yeah.  That was five minutes of terribleness.  Yeah.  If we did it with those three sticks, it would have worked a lot better. 
[03:35:00]  If you were juggling?  Yeah.  Like the kid on American Idol.  Do you know how to juggle?  Explaining it.  Do you know how to juggle?  A little, yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  What do you got?  Give me two checkbooks.  Oh, no.  Jesus.  What vaudevillian steamer trunk did you pull that joke out of?  Fucking A.  All right.  All right.  To my daughter.  Wait in this room while I go perform, and I'll be right back.  It's like a little Fordville actor brings his, hold on.  Oh, my God. 
[03:35:30]  Do you have grenades, Stan?  Wow.  I was just saying to go with those bombs.  Oof.  Did I say J.C. Crow?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I'm having a tough one.  I heard it.  I didn't catch it.  Instead of J.C. Crow?  I wouldn't have known.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for being an ass.  No easy answers tonight for investigators working a deadly plane crash in Van Nuys.  The Cessna Citation jet crashed just after takeoff yesterday, killing both pilots. 
[03:36:00]  Witnesses say a luggage hatch near the nose of the plane was open on takeoff, but it's unclear if that caused the crash.  The plane did not have cockpit voice or flight data recorders.  Oh.  Cockpiss.  Oh.  You got to watch the cockpiss recorders.  Oh, boy, yeah.  That could be a problem.  All right, Rich.  No comment on that one, Rich?  I didn't hear.  I was there.  Preparing me.  Now, that plane crash wasn't Van Nuys.  Maybe they could have checked the black box. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, she wasn't on the flight.  Yeah, voice recorder.  You know.  I don't know if there's one on planes.  What?  Are you talking about the one that crashed in Jersey?  Van Nuys, New Jersey, yes.  Van Nuys, New Jersey, yeah.  Small plane crash in Jersey, yes, Rich.  Yeah, yesterday.  Into a house.  In the driveway.  Into the driveway.  Yeah.  One of the dudes that was on the scene.  Tragic.  EMT.  EMT guy.  He goes to the scene of the plane accident and finds out it was his father. 
[03:37:00]  His dad.  No way.  What are the fucking odds of that?  Well, 50-50.  I mean.  It is or it isn't.  Why, Donald?  So this father, he found his father dead in a plane.  He's one of the crew that pulled up and, you know, hey, you got to call him a plane crash.  They go to the scene.  The guy goes to the plane and realizes, holy shit.  Yeah, he wasn't going there because he found out his father was in a plane crash.  He was just, that's his job.  Jesus. 
[03:37:30]  He was first on the scene and then he finds out that it was his father.  Sam likes marshmallows.  Isn't that cute?  That's adorable.  He's got the same skin color, you know, and you get the same body texture.  All right, here.  Oh, Sam wants a little sweet treat.  Yeah, he's got a sweet tooth.  Marshmallows have been in the studio for like two weeks.  When he was a boy, I bet if he got A's and B's on his report card, he got to take some marshmallows. 
[03:38:00]  Now he can have them whenever he pleases here.  Look, he stuffs them up in those rosy cheeks like a little chipmunk.  Have a marshmallow on me.  Did you ever toast?  Literally.  He was just sneaking marshmallows.  That's a good call by someone catching that one.  Did you ever toast those over your stove and have like the gas taste on them?  No.  I wasn't raised on a prairie in 1850.  Why would I?  Like at a camp out with wood, you know.  If you had them at home and you wanted to roast them at home, you never did it over your stove? 
[03:38:30]  No, because I knew that it would taste like shit.  Maybe up in your tree house or something?  No, nothing like that.  Oh, God.  That was some great juggling.  I hope there's no coffee in that three hatchets.  All right, here you go.  There he goes.  The great juggling rich fuck.  Anyone can do it that many times.  It's not called juggling.  It's called throwing the balls up and dropping them.  Anyone can get all three balls up in the air once. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  It gets hard after that.  All right, well.  All right.  He's done it a couple of times.  There he goes.  He's juggling.  Now he's juggling.  All right.  There's little hands.  Sit back down.  There you go.  That's wonderful.  That's a little teeny hands.  Oh, see, when I accomplish something, sit down.  No more.  But I'm a good juggler.  You accomplished juggling on the radio.  On the radio.  Well, you know.  Boy.  I think it's time for me to leave my seat.  I can't compete against that. 
[03:39:30]  I can't compete against that.  You're right, Rich.  What am I doing here?  That does make for some brilliant radio.  Holy shit.  Poor Rich.  He is taking a beating today.  Yeah.  But you know what?  Right from the second you fucking walked in the door with that faggot bag.  A purse-a-book.  And he brought it in to show it off.  There wasn't even anything in the bag.  What do you mean?  There's a lot of shit in there.  My Sony nice headphones, Comedy Central, gave me for Christmas. 
[03:40:00]  They're nice.  Are they good?  Are they noise-canceling?  Yeah.  You wear them on the plane?  Yeah.  She got Bose.  And they can plug into...  It was a Christmas present.  iPod?  You got an iPod?  I got an iPod there, too.  What's on your iPod?  How many gigs did they give you?  244 songs.  Are they any good?  Yeah.  Great stuff.  Oh, those are good ones.  Panasonic?  Yeah.  What are the ones you...  Jim's got...  Bows are better.  Bows.  Or bows.  Bows are better? 
[03:40:30]  I think so.  You only have 240...  You're a mic.  There's a lot of great visuals today.  Jimmy's really frustrated with his mic.  He fixes it and then goes to talk again and the whole mic goes...  And it just comes back down again.  Are you going to...  I'm not going to break your headphones.  Don't.  Shut up.  I'll throw a laugh.  Why else would I do it?  For tears?  I want to break the boys up into it.  Oh, my...  What are you looking at? 
[03:41:00]  I'm not doing anything, man.  I'm just looking at Jimmy with...  It's not always me.  It's his headphones on.  That's okay.  300 bucks for a laugh if it's worth it to you.  For 300 bucks.  I think he's doing the calculations.  He wouldn't pay you back.  Huh?  He wouldn't.  For that, he would have to.  These don't...  These are...  Don't do it.  I don't think they...  Are they good?  Huh?  Panasonic.  They can't be 300 bucks.  What are the bows?  They go for a lot, right?  300 something.  300. 
[03:41:30]  So those don't go for no 300.  You're jacking up the price, you Jew.  It's $300.  If it's worth the laugh.  That's how much I have on me.  Oh, hey.  That's three hookers.  Whoa.  I'll give you 70.  I got 1,000 in my pocket.  What's that going to do?  Come on, 300. 
[03:42:00]  These fucking guys are a blonde to laugh.  I can't tell you.  These fucking guys should be the Catskills together.  Oh, Jesus.  That is fucking funny.  The Cumberbund Brothers.  God damn it.  That's fucking funny.  God damn it.  Fucking blonde, Bill.  I should have said that and then broken them.  I'm going to borrow 300.  God damn me.  That's funny. 
[03:42:30]  That was very funny.  Oh, wait.  Let's go to Matt in Queensbury.  Matt, Queensbury.  Hey, Queensbury.  By the way, blueberries are making their way back onto the market.  Are they?  Slowly but surely, yeah.  I had my first batch of blueberries of the new year.  How were they?  Pretty good.  But they need to ripen a little bit more.  The blueberries.  Blueberries.  Matt from Queensbury.  Matt?  Yeah, guys.  Rich's line there, give me two checkbooks to show, you know, juggle in there.  I think that's the corniest joke I've ever heard come out of my talking sound box. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, juggle the books.  I get it.  Right.  All right.  Findings are being reported by the Times of India in an article called Indian Men Don't Measure Up.  Poor fit contributes to a higher failure rate, which experts say is a major problem in India.  The number of HIV infections has been skyrocketing there.  The government study measured 1,400 men and found most...  Were they talking about their dicks don't fit in the fucking condoms or something? 
[03:43:30]  Like, the story alone is pretty hot.  Is that what they don't measure up and they're falling out of their condoms and getting AIDS or something?  There's some type of infection.  They got big cocks?  Or small cocks?  Oh, they got small cocks.  I couldn't tell.  Why, are you Indian?  Never seen an Indian man.  How do you know all about this?  Look at those lips.  What?  When you're sucking on...  What?  Wait.  Oh, this kid sucks on cocks.  Come on in. 
[03:44:00]  Who are you, sir?  My name is Franco from Oceanside.  Franco from Oceanside.  So how do you know about Indian cocks?  The article was on whackbag.com.  Oh, it was?  Yes.  Okay.  Of course it was.  Cool.  Your Indian cock website.  Yes.  Your Indian cock connection.  And it's that Indian man's cocks...  Too small?  Yeah, they don't fit in even regular-sized condoms.  Regular-sized condoms, so they should fucking...  Holy shit.  Rot little dicks falling out. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, that is the worst.  That's a bad rep to have.  Don't they have extra skin to begin with, so they got more to stuff in there or what?  Foreskin?  I don't know.  I've never seen an Indian man's cock.  Anyone?  Oh.  Where's Steve?  Well, it depends on where they're from.  It depends on what part of the country.  If you're speaking a different dialect.  Yes.  The Hindus are thicker and dowaged.  Steve, there he is.  Steve, you know anything about Indian men's cocks?  Do they have foreskin?  Foreskin? 
[03:45:00]  I went to boarding school with an Indian guy at once.  Oh.  And, yeah, a lot of foreskin on the Indians.  Oh, because their religion, Buddhism, doesn't have circumcision in it as some kind of...  Is that what it is?  I don't know.  I just remember this kid had a lot of foreskin.  Did he have a large penis?  No.  Kind of average, but just a lot of...  Did he grab it and twist his foreskin and snap it up like a window straight and laugh  and lick it?  I mean, I'm just asking.  I was very tempted to do it a few times.  Because the story itself, I thought was the story, and then I realized it was a blooper 
[03:45:30]  and the guy said infunction.  Infunction, right.  Which was always a favorite as a kid.  All right.  I couldn't hear you.  I have an infunction in my ear.  We were watching porn the other night and, you know, the size of the cocks and this and  that.  This guy comes out with a cock.  Comes out with a cock.  And Bonnie goes, look how small that is.  And it was fucking way bigger than mine.  I'm going, why would you say that?  Yeah.  I don't mind if he says...  You're not in porno.  It doesn't matter if she says it to a porno movie.  It's like, look how small that guy is to a porn movie. 
[03:46:00]  It's like if you're driving and, you know, you're watching a NASCAR thing.  He goes, look how fast he's driving.  It's NASCAR.  It doesn't mean you're driving slow, to put it in terms you can understand.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Always here to help.  Measuring up.  Sorry, folks.  We don't know how to quite tell you this, but a two-year study by the Indian Council of  Medical Research has conclusively established that the penises of Indian men are smaller,  one to two inches smaller.  Wow.  And point of fact.  That is small, considering the average penis lays somewhere between five and a half and 
[03:46:30]  six inches.  No, between three and a half and four and a half.  Is that what you tell Bonnie?  It's under ice.  Yeah.  That's what he tells Bonnie.  Right.  Look, it's average.  Yeah.  Average.  So they're talking, wow, that's a small dick, you Indians.  No one is so crotchety.  Calibrated penises of the 1,200 volunteers across the country down to the last millimeter  concluded that Indian men came up short of the international standard. 
[03:47:00]  How did the Chinese fit into this?  Because that's always the stereotype there.  Why is the Council peeking into your pants, you ask?  Well, their concern is condoms, a fifth of which fall off or tear during use by Indian  men because they're too large.  The condom, that is.  The international condom standards are not appropriate for Indians.  So the ICMR is calling for mixed-sized condoms.  Euphemism for smaller, mixed size. 
[03:47:30]  The Council fears that people would be too embarrassed to ask the pharmacist for a smaller  condom, of course.  Minis.  Say, can I have the Inder mini?  Sunil Mahra, former editor of Maxim India, is unfazed by Indians failing the international  yardstick by telling the BBC it's not size, it's what you do with it that matters.  And apparently you get aged with yours.  Yeah.  From our population, the evidence is Indians are doing pretty well. 
[03:48:00]  It doesn't matter if you could fucking shoot a load.  You could shoot a load with a fucking half-inch penis and get a woman pregnant, you dope.  With apologies to the poet Alexander Pope, you could say, four inches and centimeters, let  fools contend.  I like when a little culture is thrown into a dick story.  All right.  How great is that?  That Indians have small cocks?  Fantastic.  Hezbollah made his first TV appearance since the fighting started, and he vowed to beat back 
[03:48:30]  any ground invasion Israel may be considering.  He's also condemned Israel's bomb attacks on lesbians.  Excuse me, Lebanon.  Yeah, those dykes.  Lesbians.  Good old lesbians.  That's good.  They slip up.  What are you going to do?  They're human.  I saw a shame, shame, shame promo last night.  Are we still getting those?  Yeah, we're shame, shame, shaming still.  Shame, shame, shaming.  Yeah, definitely.  Also, I think it was A&E is playing David Caruso, CSI Miami, because now I have to catch 
[03:49:00]  the beginning every single night.  Last night, I was pissed because it was the one that was in one of the montages.  No?  Open the door so you can hear it.  No, I wouldn't expect you to.  Only a blathering idiot should do that.  It's one of the montage pieces that was on the video.  We're going to catchphrase.  There was one of them.  There we go. 
[03:49:30]  Thanks.  When he does that, I want to take these alligator teeth I'm holding and smack his face.  Yeah, just slap him.  It goes through me.  Because his lips go like, man, take.  Yeah, it's on a face.  He's really into it.  It's on a face.  But yeah, it was one that was in that whole group of clips.  So I was pissed.  It was one where his friend gets blown up with a hand grenade, and he puts the sad little  face on, and then they go into, yeah, yeah.  I don't want that.  I want the bad acting.  Do you take CSI over Law & Order? 
[03:50:00]  No, I take it as a complete goof, because David Caruso is the worst actor delivering the  worst lines ever written.  It was the worst direction I've ever seen.  It's so horrific to watch.  Isn't it like one of the top shows on TV or something?  Exactly.  I don't know how.  You like David Caruso's acting?  No, I don't watch the show.  I've never really watched it.  I watched Law & Order.  I mean, he doesn't, he's the same emotion every time he's seen it.  Finally, Brad and Angie. 
[03:50:30]  The last story of the day.  Brangelina is now calling the Big Easy home.  We have to save Brad Pitt.  What?  Brad Pitt.  At this point, we've got to go save Brad Pitt.  We're moving to New Orleans.  We have to save Brad Pitt.  That could fuck anyone.  Call out the National Guard.  Be so pussy whipped.  This guy is pussy whipped.  Why are they moving to New Orleans?  Well, Brad and Angelina have moved with their three children to flood ravage New Orleans,  where they are living in a mansion. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, okay.  Why don't you go all the way if you're going down there?  Yeah.  Living in a mansion in the city's historic French Quarter and plan to send their kids  to a local school.  It was reported yesterday.  There's no way this is true.  Black kids, though, they got, right?  How many?  They got a mix.  No, they got a ching chong and one ching chong.  One negro.  Right.  One that can't fit a rubber. 
[03:51:30]  And I think one waterhead, because we haven't seen the baby, really.  I think they're hiding the other one.  Oh, one that is a natural?  Yeah, they did a natural, but you don't see that one.  You see the ching chong and the negro.  That's great.  Which is the oldest?  The ching chong.  Is the natural one the youngest?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  The baby.  We love it there, Angelina said.  Why?  The couple, known for their humanitarian efforts, reportedly picked the city partly to draw attention  to its plight. 
[03:52:00]  I think we all know what happened.  Is there any...  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie moving to New Orleans is going to enlighten everybody as to  what happened there?  Pompous.  Yeah.  That is so fucking...  Look how important we are.  One source suggested that the paparazzi plagued Angelina also may be interested in finding  some refuge from the camera.  Oh.  Yeah, the paparazzi aren't going to follow you down there.  Of course not.  Angelina is interested in befriending normal moms so she can do things with the kids. 
[03:52:30]  Good luck.  Did you see the fucking footage out of New Orleans?  Normal moms?  Stop it.  What is she...  What are they thinking?  She's insane.  I know that.  You know what?  But I thought he liked my...  Well, it wasn't...  Look, she's...  Crazy.  She's already gone.  She's always been like that.  Yeah.  Always.  But it's Brad Pitt.  What is he doing at this point?  He must be a great fuck.  That's what I was thinking.  I guess.  Ah, that gets boring after a while.  Billy...  What?  I was going to say Billy Bob is lucky.  No, a guy like him could fuck anything. 
[03:53:00]  So you know he's getting bored of her.  What are you kidding me?  You get bored.  But he's pulling all the moves of somebody that's not bored.  He's pulling all the moves of someone that is very pussy with.  Of week one fucking.  That's what he's doing.  Move to New Orleans?  Yeah.  French corner.  He doesn't want to go there.  He's too scared to speak up at this point.  Yeah, that place stinks.  He probably beats him up behind closed doors.  Oh.  Yeah.  Puts things in his backside.  Imagine him cowering.  Makes him watch his own movies.  That says if you don't go to New Orleans, I'm going to release this tape. 
[03:53:30]  What's tape?  What?  You think there's a...  No, I'm just saying.  I was going with Jimmy's...  I heard there was, actually.  Oh, oh, oh.  With the thing up his butt.  I was just going with Jimmy's line there.  Oh, okay.  The strap on.  I was working a little bit.  So Brad Pitt takes it up the ass with a strap on.  That's what the rule of the husband.  Oh, okay.  But not from her.  From actually a third party.  Oh.  While she watches and eats like little bonbons and chocolates.  Feeds them to the children.  All right.  Oh, man. 
[03:54:00]  We'll call back.  Sorry.  Yeah.  It's time to wrap up this show.  Yeah.  Rich, it was a pleasure.  I had a good time.  Rich, always fun.  What are we plugging?  Hammering you?  Oh, Saturday night we're doing a show, Bonnie and I, here.  And then the Palms on the 10th.  And also vote at Comedy Central.  All right.  Hey, Rich, what do you know about bowdogfight.com?  I know if...  It's got to be good if you're going to talk about it.  I know one thing.  Wow.  What do you think bowdogfight.com is about? 
[03:54:30]  It's probably like the pit bull fights and the dog fights.  Bowdog?  It's dog fights.  A sport that isn't legal anywhere even near the fucking civilized world.  It's sponsoring on our show.  Dogfighting.  Dogfighting.  Oh, Shane fighting.  And cock fights.  Cock fights.  And pit bulls.  That's fantastic.  Dog fighting.  All right.  How about we give you another chance?  Okay. 
[03:55:00]  Bowdogfight.com.  Bowdog.  The, uh...  It's some kind of like, you know, full contact fighting, uh, it's a...  Oh, okay.  You know, full contact fighting site.  Okay.  Bowdog.  For what?  Are you good?  For full contact fighting.  People.  Yeah.  Yeah, for people.  That doesn't make sense.  Those knife motors are sloppy.  It doesn't make sense if you're dealing with an amateur, but we are looking for a pro. 
[03:55:30]  That's the David Caruso delivery.  Today's CSI, the line of the day, are looking for a pro.  What a tool he is.  He is the worst, horrible actor.  We got to mop up a little bit.  Matt on Long Island, Matt?  Yeah, I wanted to tell you, you're wrong about that baby.  It's like a super baby.  It has the best qualities of both of them.  Okay.  I was, uh, I don't think I've seen a picture of it yet.  That's all. 
[03:56:00]  It's in the, it was in the Daily News, like, two weeks ago.  It had, it had her eyes and, like, his face.  It was, it's going to take over the world.  It's going to take on the world.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I guess it's not a waterhead, then, in New Orleans.  Thank you, Matt.  No problem.  Bowdogfight.com sponsors line of the day.  Here is the runner-up line of the day.  Stereotypical white guy.  I wonder why you shave like that.  Why do you shave like that?  With a gun to my back.  It's that white woman.  Yes.  Holding the razor with your foot. 
[03:56:30]  Jimmy's cring.  Rich got all happy.  He thought it was him for a second.  He got all excited.  And then he realized it was just the setup for Jimmy's line.  That was just a bounce pass.  Yeah.  He gave Jimmy the bounce pass.  And a siss.  That was a good assist.  All right.  And finally, here is today's line of the day.  Thanks to bowdogfight.com.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.

[03:57:30]  The end.  Jimmy Norton.  Wow.  The end of the day.  God, that was funny.  Perfect setup.  That was like the perfect play.  It's great.  It would have been better if I would have broken it.  I should have broken it.  No, of course you should have broken it.  That was perfect because he was expecting it.  You turned that around nicely, I thought.  Yeah.  Because sometimes you're put in a position in the studio like, oh, everyone expects you  to break it now.  It's like, you want it to be unexpected.  Plus, I like the bows anyhow.  Hey, Jimmy, you need help with zanies?  You're all right?

Wait, Vernon Hills or St. Charles, and then Saturday is either St. Charles or Vernon Hills.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm in downtown Chicago, Vernon Hills, St. Charles.

[03:58:30]  I believe so, yes.  Yeah, check out Jimmy on Steve Dahl's show on WCKG if you're in the Chicago area.  All right.  Rich, thanks.  Thanks, man.  Any last words?  No, man.

Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.  Poopy malarkey.  Tiny cooley.  Let me titter.  I get it.  Someone pinch me.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  K-sirah-sirah.  Mumbo-jumbo.  Good nature joshing around. 
[03:59:30]  Puppy cock.  Poopy jokes.  Silly.  Hum-a-hum-a-hum-a-hum-a.  We just chit-chat and go nuts.  What do you think of them apples?  It's lame.  It's not even fun to listen to, you know?  I don't know how they could screw up something that simple.  Oh!  Ah!  But boy, they sure did.  Poopy and Anthony!  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.
