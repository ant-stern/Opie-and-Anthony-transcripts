<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie recounting a graphic and sexually explicit anecdote about a massage gone wrong, leading to raunchy banter with Anthony.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to the Olympic Games, focusing heavily on critical commentary of NBC's coverage and openly homophobic remarks about figure skaters, particularly Johnny Weir, who was repeatedly targeted with slurs.  Audio clips of Weir's interviews were played, and callers discussed a black speed skater's controversial sponsorship and their frustrations with NBC's broadcast. A segment followed where callers identified themselves as the "bad boy" of various activities. The show concluded this segment with a discussion of the show's "Pests" and their successful, albeit disruptive, takeover of Scott Ferrall's and Pharrell's SiriusXM shows, framing it as a marketing strategy.

The next segment focused on the ongoing prank war with the "Pests," detailing their coordinated and technologically sophisticated attack on Pharrell's show using repeated phrases like "Party Rock" and references to "Frederica Bimmel," effectively shutting down the broadcast.  The hosts discussed the Pests' methods and speculated on the reactions of other SiriusXM personalities, including Howard Stern.

Following this, the show transitioned to a multi-faceted segment.  It began with a bizarre bit idea about a massage and anal penetration, quickly shifting to a scathing attack on radio personality Tom Likas,  referring to him with multiple vulgar and offensive terms.  Audio clips of Likas were played, highlighting the contrast between his on-air persona and his perceived true nature. The hosts recounted a confrontational encounter with Likas. A caller, John, promoted his brother's restaurant, FH Raleigh's, mentioning a magician named Fast Daddy. The conversation then turned to Michael Medved, contrasting his views on marriage with Likas' cynical perspectives. The hosts also mocked a female XM employee, Ellen, using crude language, and made fun of a pre-recorded listener call.  Further crude jokes were shared, including one deemed disgusting by the hosts themselves.  The hosts then launched into a critique of Tony Danza's radio show, playing audio clips and making crude comments about Danza's daughter.  A "Howie Math" calculation about their contribution to XM subscribers was also discussed. The segment concluded with a phone call from Dale Earnhardt Jr., where they discussed NASCAR penalties and the ownership of his father's number 3.

The following segment heavily featured Anthony's frustrations with the complexities of buying a new house, particularly a drawn-out and expensive mold inspection.  He detailed bureaucratic hurdles and excessive costs, prompting a discussion about corruption and unnecessary expenses in various industries. Opie shared his own darkly humorous experiences with NYC house hunting, revealing properties with unsettling histories of previous occupant deaths.  The hosts also discussed their high cholesterol levels, with Eric revealing his past high cholesterol due to diet and Accutane. Callers, including Momo, shared their own real estate woes, corroborating Anthony's frustrations.  Another caller discussed title search issues.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a fraudulent "Schizo Bill" website.  The hosts urged listeners to overload the site to shut it down. A listener called in to celebrate their one-year anniversary of listening to the show.  The broadcast concluded with extensive, humorous, and darkly comedic discussion about Dick Cheney's hunting accident, focusing on the delayed public statement and perceived spin control, along with numerous jokes and impressions.  The show ended with discussion about the show's expanding reach beyond airtime via platforms like PalTalk.  A separate short phone interview with Dale Earnhardt Jr. discussed NASCAR penalties, the ownership of his father's number 3, and was abruptly cut short due to a time constraint. The hosts promised to continue the interview the following day and promoted his appearance on XM 144 that evening.

[00:01:30]  ¶¶  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps,  an uncommon band of heroes unites to fight the forces of evil.  The Obi and Anthony Show!  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With Otto.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No!  That's her.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful. 
[00:02:00]  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like poorly spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Remember Steve yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile in a Dexonix.  Paukatosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers.  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes. 
[00:02:30]  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ooh.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We look like assholes right now, man. 
[00:03:00]  Hello, exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Good morning.  We're all sitting down and ready to broadcast.  Sit, broadcast.  But yeah, that was kind of cutting it close, wasn't it? 
[00:03:30]  Usually we hang out in here for a few minutes, look at what we want to get to.  Today it's sit down and broadcast.  Yeah, we really...  We stayed in the office a little long today.  And then again, I looked at my watch and I'm like, holy shit.  We're trying to do a show.  We were talking like, I don't know, old ladies in the office.  Like hens.  Talking about our problems in life.  Our life issues that we have.  Business things and...  Anthony's talking about a mold inspector or something. 
[00:04:00]  Trying to buy a house.  You know, I've been trying to buy a fucking house for two and a half years.  I've actually been trying for two and a half years to buy a house.  Did you notice I was trying to show interest?  But I'm sitting there like, it's 6, 10 in the morning and he's talking about fucking mold.  What has our lives become?  And then I felt guilty because I went back to reading because there's a lot of great stuff in the paper today. 
[00:04:30]  And I'm like, man, I better look up a couple times and show interest because it's my pal.  He's reaching out to me here.  He's trying to buy a house.  But then again, I'm like, he's talking about fucking mold.  Oh.  What happened to us?  You think Jimmy...  We used to be shuck jocks and rock jocks.  We used to talk about boobs and this and that.  And it's come down to this.  Fast forward 10 years.  I got a fucking mold inspector that's holding me up.  But it is actually kind of interesting. 
[00:05:00]  You got to go.  What exactly?  What do they have to inspect for?  Shut up.  All right.  There's no mold.  That's just it.  Everyone's got their hand in the till.  It's been inspected.  Then all of a sudden, they need another inspection because some guy knows the guy that does that.  And they figure, ah, here's another easy fucking couple of hundred bucks.  So they send this guy.  And then it's just there's a long line of people with their hands out in between someone that wants to buy a house and someone that wants to sell a house. 
[00:05:30]  It should be an exchange of a check and a hearty handshake.  But there are so many hands in the middle going, what about me, boss?  What about me, boss?  Hey, what about me, boss?  What about me, boss?  Just grabbing money.  Grabbing and pulling.  It doesn't make sense.  The best part about this, because you've been discussing this off and on for the last couple of weeks. 
[00:06:00]  There was a time you brought this up in the old office before the show.  There was a time you want to buy someone's house.  Yeah.  Knock, knock, knock.  I want to buy your house.  All right.  Here you go.  Here's the keys.  They didn't even have keys back then.  No.  They weren't scared of shwuggies back then.  And you just took over someone's house.  That was it.  Yeah.  That was it.  There was no real paperwork.  Maybe there was one thing you had to sign like, hey, I agree to give, dude, my house. 
[00:06:30]  You give him three horses, a wagon, and a couple of slaves.  Right.  And then the house is yours.  Fast forward a mere hundred some odd years, and it's just a nightmare.  Eventually, I think it's just going to come to a screeching halt, and people are just going to walk around this earth waiting for something to happen that never happens.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because of the red tape and all the bullshit.  Too much red tape.  We're going to just stop functioning, I think.  Yeah.  It's just lawyers. 
[00:07:00]  Lawyers, I put at the top of the guilt list, they're guilty because they feel that they've got to just get involved in everything  and write up all these rules that get them involved in things so they can get paid.  Yeah.  And then other people are in there.  There's a whole buddy-buddy mentality when it comes to buying a house.  Everybody knows somebody else that can help you out with this, that, or the other thing.  Instead of you picking your own people.  Like, it starts with the builder and the realtor, and they know this guy who knows this guy. 
[00:07:30]  And it's all these people that know each other that are like, eh, this guy seems good for $300 here, $500 there.  You know, and I finally just lost my fucking mind last night with the mortgage guy.  I just lost my mind on him.  Because, you know, a week ago I'm hearing, well, it's done deal.  You know, mortgage is done. 
[00:08:00]  You're ready to buy a house.  Here it is.  Oh, and then he pulls a Columbo on me.  Oh, but there's just one more thing.  Just one more thing.  Yeah.  There's always just one more thing.  The mold inspector that was in your house needs to send a letter verifying that there wasn't any mold.  Well, what did he do?  I thought that's what he did.  That's what he did.  He has to send over his license.  Oh, he does, does he?  I did a little research. 
[00:08:30]  There's no such thing as a mold inspector license.  No such thing.  No such thing.  No such thing, Jimmy.  No such thing.  No such thing.  Are you saying that doesn't exist?  There's no such thing?  There's no such thing.  No such thing.  It's an apparition.  He's telling you.  It doesn't exist.  But how do you become a certified mold inspector?  You don't.  You don't.  There's no such thing, Jimmy.  You work for some kind of pest thing.  Like, if you want an inspector to come over and check for termites and water and this, that, it all fits into the whole thing.  But there isn't Mr. Mold that comes out. 
[00:09:00]  Hello, I'm Mold.  Here's my mold license.  Inspector Molder.  So who was lying to you?  Huh?  Was the mortgage guy lying to you?  No, he didn't know either.  It's the broker goes through the bank, of course, and the bank, lending the money, wants to make sure everything's hunky-dory.  Sure.  Everything's hunky-dory.  It's a brand new house.  No one has lived here before.  It is just built.  They are still putting little doodads in it. 
[00:09:30]  It is not an old house.  It has been checked for mold.  There's no mold.  But for some reason, the bank wants this thing because I think the bank is tied in with this guy who knows a guy.  It's all this fucking nepotism shit that's going on.  So I just unloaded on him last night.  I was using the F word.  It sounded like me on the radio show.  I was talking to this mortgage broker just cursing like crazy.  Did you call any of those curses that you come up with that make no sense?  No, I saved those for special occasions. 
[00:10:00]  I was just very pissed off.  Yeah.  And, you know, he's got a commission to make on this thing.  And I got our super agent Bob Eatman on the phone and had him call and maybe discuss other options that we might be looking at aside from him.  And I heard the no, no, no.  We'll get done.  I'll call you tomorrow with everything.  Don't worry about it.  Everything's taken care of.  So with the license, what did he say had to happen?  Like the guy that they'd charge you more money to have the license do what? 
[00:10:30]  Right.  To have a licensed mold guy come in and make sure there isn't mold.  But there isn't.  And there is no license guy.  Oh, a piece of shit.  But someone called me.  But some guy called me and said he's willing to go in there for $450 in check.  And I was like, you know something?  Yeah.  I'll call you back.  Don't bother calling me.  I'll call you back.  Dude, I'll do that for you for $300.  There's no reason.  You don't need a licensed guy.  Jimmy?  I've been doing that for years.  Sold.  Yeah.  You're in.  It's just complicating everything in this world. 
[00:11:00]  Momo wants in.  Momo.  Gentlemen.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up?  Nothing.  Listen, Ant.  Yes.  I just wanted to give you a heads up.  Because I just built a house about a year ago.  I used to live in Harrisburg and recently moved to, well, not recently, but about five years ago, moved to Memphis.  Anyway, point being is that there are a lot of shysters out there when it comes to the, especially the mortgage brokers.  Yeah.  The builder that we used, we were real fortunate. 
[00:11:30]  We had no problems whatsoever.  Now, I will say this, though.  They make it like buying a car anymore when you build a house.  You pick out which model you want, what your options are, and then they build it for you, which is actually not a bad deal.  And they kind of make the process less painful.  They keep everything as a work in-house.  They use it.  Yeah.  I had no problem with the builder.  Right.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying that.  It's just the thing, the chain of events that take place from the time you decide this is your house, you want to buy it, 
[00:12:00]  to the time you get your fucking keys and can walk into that house without a realtor, a builder, a fucking this guy, that guy, inspector, the other guy.  I want to be able to stand in this house with nobody else in the fucking thing.  Nobody trying to push or fucking talk about it or anything.  Leave me alone.  Give me my keys.  My friend Anthony wants to walk into his brand spanking new multi-million dollar mansion. 
[00:12:30]  At least someone understands.  Yes, Jimmy.  Thank you.  How funny would it be if he was there three weeks and had to be hospitalized for mold?  Let's go to RPM.  Ah, shit.  RPM.  Thank you.  Mold test is the biggest scam in the construction industry.  Yep, it certainly is.  I saw a whole Fox News thing on it the other day.  There's a big scam going on. 
[00:13:00]  It's always got mold.  People are petrified right now of mold.  So there's all these people are popping up about this mold issue.  If it's really got bad mold, it's a problem.  But if a house has never been lived in, it's got some type of mold in it and it's a big scam.  Put it this way.  Yeah, the house I'm in now that I'm renting, it had some ceiling leaks at one point and things.  And I'm calling the landlord and stuff.  And I've seen the black around where the leaking is and know that's mold.  And, you know, what are you going to do?  I don't fucking own the place. 
[00:13:30]  I rent it.  You live with it.  It's fucking mold.  I've bitten into a sandwich once and gone, oh, what's that taste?  You turn over the bread and look, this fucking mold.  It's mold.  We live on this planet.  We share the planet with the mold.  I ate a blueberry the other day that had some kind of mold on it.  We live with mold.  Don't be so scared of mold.  I understand some people breathe mold in.  They're gone.  They drop dead.  Mold is your friend.  Mold is your friend.  Let's get bumper stickers made.  But I know.  Mold is your friend.  You ever peel back a clit hood and you see a little green stuff with fur on it? 
[00:14:00]  Who cares, right?  Dig in.  You tough it up and you finish.  Then you leave the mausoleum.  Oh, my God.  Without getting long or technical on this, it's a new house.  The guy that was inspecting for mold went down there, did the check.  There's no mold.  He did a humidity test.  The basement is 35% humidity.  Now, this is like unheard of in a basement. 
[00:14:30]  I do believe that's terrific.  It's dry.  The conditions are not conducive to the growth of mold.  If it was, then I would say, all right, let's get a guy in there, check the air, which takes two fucking weeks.  And if there's a problem with leakage, the basement's completely dry and it's not even humid down there.  So enough with the fucking mold.  Enough with the moose. 
[00:15:00]  Buy the fucking house.  This is a tough basement.  I don't need to tell you that.  I don't need to tell you that.  You've got a problem with mold.  Could you forget the mold, Arthur?  Taking the knife out of the mold.  You think you want some mold?  Let's go to Paul on Long Island.  Paul.  Hey, hey, what about this one?  I bought a brand new house, East North Port.  Yeah.  Fucking title search.  Who fucking owns the house before me?  It's brand new.  Dude, the money that you got to spend on a title search. 
[00:15:30]  Who lost it?  That they got to search for it.  It's a new fucking house.  And then they're telling me, well, the property that it's built on, they got to do a title search.  What?  Did someone lose it along the way?  Title search.  And it's an amazing amount of money for nothing.  For something that's in a file somewhere in a lawyer's cabinet.  You know how I saved money on the title search?  That when they were looking for it, I found it and I ran it and I went, yo-hoo, I have it.  Here it is.  Stop the search.  I searched for it.  Here it is.  Got it.  Let me loosen the file cabinet.  I'll dig it up. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And it's not going to cost me fucking a couple of grand.  Here it is.  It was in a box in the closet.  Found it.  Found it.  It was crammed up my asshole along with those other 50 hands.  People reaching for things.  One other thing with gravity is something called centripetal farce.  Look it up.  Don't start with that thing.  Oh, enough.  There's a thread on the message board six pages long about that.  We all know about gravity.  If you're spinning, you have gravity.  End of discussion.  Exactly.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Guys, I'm looking to buy a house, too.  Yes.  Here in New York City. 
[00:16:30]  Have fun with that.  And I see my future because I'm a little behind Anthony right now.  Dude, you know something?  I'll be looking at some more places today, matter of fact.  You'll learn.  Learn from me.  Everyone's got their hand in the till.  And get somebody behind you that is on your side.  Well, you know, you've got to learn the whole thing.  You've got to go through the process, you know?  And I've been looking for about a month now.  And I'm sick of looking at dead people's houses. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, is that what the city's full of?  That's why they're selling.  That's the only reason.  That's why they're selling unless you go for new construction.  Yeah.  If you go with anything that's a little older, that means that person died.  And that's the only reason that...  How did it happen?  And that's the only reason the house is up for sale.  Oh, no.  I told you about the brownstone I was thinking of buying.  Yeah.  Well, part of the brownstone.  Part of the...  A floor.  If we didn't do that old Sex for Sam thing, I could have bought the whole goddamn thing. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, please.  Mortgage.  Mortgage.  Right.  Lay out cash like I'm paying for my morning bagel.  Right.  But we had to do the sex in the church.  So now I can only buy part of a brownstone.  We're such idiots.  No helicopters out to the Hamptons for us, kids.  I was talking to Bruce Mittman last night.  Oh, bu-bu-bu-boy.  Our old boss, bu-bu-bu-boys, who claims that he discovered us, boys.  Yeah.  I'll get back to the thing. 
[00:18:00]  I'm the third Opie and Anthony.  And he wants to have a meeting with us because he runs an agency now.  And he's going to get a couple...  What kind of agency?  He's going to get a couple clients to advertise with our show.  Oh, all right.  Bruce?  And he's still trying to claim that I'm the problem.  I'm like, Bruce, that was...  You know, we worked with him, what, starting 10 years ago?  Yeah.  And then for maybe a two to three year period?  Uh-huh.  We've been out of his watch for, what, over seven, eight years now?  Mm-hmm.  And he still thinks I'm the problem.  I'm like, I'm not the problem. 
[00:18:30]  Because he's convinced I did the mayor...  Well, I did the mayor thing, I guess.  Yeah.  I'm like, look, Bruce, the Sex for Sam thing, it wasn't really my thing.  Something we all did.  It was kind of a group effort on that one.  We had done for a couple of years, so...  But anyway, he's going to be coming on the show very soon.  He said if we take a meeting with him and his clients, he'll come on the show and we  could beat him up.  I would take a meeting with Brucey out of nowhere, just to sit, just for the stories.  And I go, Bruce, you have people all over the country imitating you, and these are newer 
[00:19:00]  fans.  They have no idea where the impression comes from, but they love it.  Oh, to have him on the show would be great.  Yeah.  And everyone could hear him.  Boy, I remember a time.  Anyway, so getting back to the house hunting, I told you about the brownstone with this really  nice French family.  And the place was beautiful.  And I'm like, why...  This is an old story, but maybe for the new listeners, this was a couple of weeks ago.  And I'm outside talking to the people that showed me the house, and I'm like, why do 
[00:19:30]  they want to sell?  It's kind of weird.  And they hinted, well, they had a tragedy.  Which I guess is not...  A tragedy.  Oh, no.  This music again.  Oh, God.  And it turns out their son committed suicide in this brownstone I was looking at, which  is horrific, obviously.  Did they say that?  And now, the first thought in my mind is, where did he do it?  I just saw the whole house.  I'm like, was it in that beautiful backyard? 
[00:20:00]  Was it in the room with the big flat screen TV?  Was it in the back bedroom?  Yeah, is it a room I'm going to be spending a lot of time in?  Was it in the tiny bathroom?  Was it in the bathtub?  So I got so creeped out.  I'm like, ugh.  And I'm noticing, as I continue my search, that's all it is.  Dead people selling their houses.  How did he kill himself?  Or the family selling...  I don't know.  I didn't want to know.  At that point, I just didn't want to know.  It was creepy enough.  But that's what I'm finding out. 
[00:20:30]  I went into another place, and they had, like, handicap rails all over the bathroom.  Oh, boy.  And then there was a picture of some older guy in a wheelchair, and they didn't even  remove the wheelchair from the place.  So the dead guy's wheelchair is still there?  Still there.  And just in case you're wondering what it's all about, there's a picture of a guy in that  wheelchair on the wall.  And then you go in the bathroom, and there's handicap rails everywhere.  I'm like, great. 
[00:21:00]  Guy died.  Family wants to sell the place.  No, thank you.  Did it smell like old guy?  No, it was decorated old guy.  This is the thing I hate about looking for houses.  Like I said, I looked for two and a half years.  Two and a half years looking.  And originally, I was looking at just houses that people live in, you know, still that  were built, and people had lived in them and stuff.  I got so tired of other people's disgusting shit that I finally just said, no, new house.  New fucking house. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  You walk in, and there's some yappy, yappy dog.  And all you see are stains on the carpet.  And you know that underneath the carpet, there's just big piss stains all over the place.  Or some fucking conchita is cooking something that's just embedded the smell of Mexican food into the walls.  The bathrooms, it's just like old fucking toilet.  Well, you know, you could go in here and have the bathroom redone. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, that's what I want to do.  I want to buy a house and then have a construction crew in there for fucking months getting a new bathroom put in.  How many times did you walk into a place and just go, they want how much for this?  Yeah, they want what?  They want what?  This is what I get with my money?  Yeah.  Huh?  And it doesn't matter how much money you're making.  I'm sure there's a lot of people who are laying.  It's all relative.  It's all relative.  It's all relative.  You have an amount of money you could spend on a house, and you think it's a good amount.  Yeah.  For the type of life you got.  And then you start, you know, looking at houses in that price range, and you're amazed. 
[00:22:30]  You're like, this is all I get for my money?  You want to buy a $300,000 house, you look at a $300,000 house, and you don't think you should be paying any more than $200,000 for it.  You understand.  Right.  That's how it is.  I had $2,200 for a down payment, and it was what a nightmare.  Wow.  I wanted to buy new construction in Manhattan on Park Avenue, and I had $2,200.  Half of it was in cash.  Oh, I thought you said $200.  $2,200. 
[00:23:00]  That's right.  Well, highfalutin.  Highfalutin.  That's right.  In cash.  $1,100.  Cash money.  Half of it.  Well, okay.  Well, the search continues.  Yeah.  We got to move on because we have so much to do today.  Mm-hmm.  So much.  We got more Pharrell calls.  And we also have bad...  You know what?  We should start where we ended the show yesterday.  We wanted to go with bad boy figure skating.  So we'll do that in a few minutes here.  All right.  Such a thing.  But first, Schizo Bill, we got an update from his friend Bill in Cleveland.  Oh, good.  Everyone's name is Bill with these people. 
[00:23:30]  I know.  That's what makes it a little confusing.  Bill in Cleveland.  How's your friend Schizo Bill?  Oh, he's a little upset right now, Opie.  Why?  Oh, there's someone that started a website, SchizoBill.com.  Yeah.  And he's trying to make money off of it.  How is he trying to make money?  He...  He's...  If you go to SchizoBill.com, you see that he says, send the...  What does it say here?  It says, send the webmaster money at your leisure and check me out at MySpace.  That's fraud. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Send the webmaster money.  Yeah.  Jeez, that's not even trying.  Yeah.  Is he also a mold inspector?  Anyone that sells that guy...  Uh, sells.  Jesus.  Anyone that sends that guy money is just stupid.  An ass.  Yes, definitely.  But he's posing as SchizoBill, though.  He's got a different pic...  A picture of a different guy.  Yeah.  Well, he's not SchizoBill.  Well, I don't think your SchizoBill is the first SchizoBill, is the problem. 
[00:24:30]  That could be true.  This could be a legitimate SchizoBill.  So this could be a legitimate SchizoBill.  He said, my name is SchizoBill, and I'm a schizophrenic comedian, and I can be heard rambling incoherently on Opie and Anthony and Ron and Fez.  By the way, the SchizoBill is the first bit that stands by itself on Audible.com.  Usually we just throw the whole show up there, but the SchizoBill bit was so special, we said, you know what, just make a one-hour thing they could download from the SchizoBill show.  So it's on Audible.com for your downloading pleasure. 
[00:25:00]  It's a pleasure.  It's just another SchizoBill, I'm thinking.  We got his picture up here.  From the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, he does?  Yeah.  All right, that guy is a fraud.  Liar.  That's a fraud right there.  I'm sure that site doesn't have much bandwidth allowance.  Yeah, guys, just pound the shit out of it, download the picture off of it, just eat up his bandwidth.  Yeah, why don't we shut that site down?  Yeah, why don't we just shut that down? 
[00:25:30]  How is it spelled?  Uh, S-C-H-I-Z-O-B-I-L-L.com.  Okay, S-C-H-I-Z-O-B-I-L-L.com.  Go ahead, guys, just bring that site down with traffic.  Goodbye!  Maybe that's actually SchizoBill's other personality, and he doesn't realize he's doing it.  Ooh, that could be.  That's very good.  And he's got a MySpace?  Yeah, he's all trying to capitalize off of a crazy person.  What a dirtbag. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, that's awesome for that.  I made him a friend.  Good point.  Oops.  I sure don't check that out.  So did Jimmy.  That's right, because I'm getting a piece of the proceeds.  Hey, uh, by the way, how did the comedy show go?  Um, the, uh, Tuesday night show?  Yeah.  Uh, there was about eight or ten people there.  None of them, uh, none of them, none of them fans of the show.  They were there to see a folk singer before us, and then, uh, they stuck around and watched  some, some, uh, local comedy for us. 
[00:26:30]  And that was, uh, wow.  Well, you gotta love the power of this radio show.  Yeah.  But it's amazing.  It's overwhelming sometimes.  Sounds horrible.  Is it the show, or is it the fact that he did the same opening line 400 times?  Right.  People are like, why would we go see that?  I know, we know Schizo Bill is a hit, because they're downloading the bit, uh, a lot on  audible.com.  All right, Bill, we're gonna let you go.  All right.  They're telling us you gotta get out of here.  Yeah, definitely. 
[00:27:00]  American Mess happens tomorrow.  You think we're gonna get anybody?  Uh, you just never know.  If anyone's planning to come by tomorrow for the open call for American Mess, please,  uh, let us know.  It would be nice to know what we, uh, got.  We're looking for anything.  Anything.  Anything a little odd, a little off, like Schizo Comedian.  You're missing a limb.  You got mental problems.  Whatever.  Come down.  You're disfigured a little bit.  You got a lot of bit.  Unusual talent.  Yeah.  Something you can do.  Come on down.  American Mess.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. 
[00:27:30]  I think I'm a Schizo.  Sometimes Nutty Jim comes out.  Not Nutty Jim.  Nutty Jim.  What is wrong with you?  By the way, uh...  I hate Nutty Jim already.  Nutty Jim is crazy.  He's like a crazy person.  When is he going to come out?  I don't know.  He just runs around.  Ha-ta-ta.  Oh, that's Nutty.  Oh, he's crazy.  He scares me.  He's trying to poke his way out right now.  Email Steve.  Steve at foundrymusic.com if you're planning on coming on down for American Mess tomorrow. 
[00:28:00]  Or if you have a picture of a cock that you think Steve might like to look at, send it to him.  He'll give you all the details, okay?  Sort through them all.  This is a very unusual call.  Fussell from Oklahoma.  Fussell.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, it's my one-year anniversary of listening to you guys.  Happy one-year anniversary of listening to us, guys.  Well, hey, happy one-year anniversary for having me as a listener, guys.  How have we done over the past year?  Think back now.  Remember one year ago, newbies to satellite radio, and now. 
[00:28:30]  How have we done?  Well, how about this?  Let's start.  What made you mark the day?  Oh, that's true.  I was driving back from Shreveport, Louisiana, to Oklahoma.  I had been down there working, and you guys entertained me the entire distance.  I never turned the channel, and I will tell you, this is the honest truth.  In a year, I haven't changed the channel.  What were we doing that day on the show?  I think it was the day you, well, it was a lot of stuff.  I think it was the best of. 
[00:29:00]  Well, that's why it was so good.  It was while you guys were on vacation, whenever you first went to free, instead of having  to pay for you.  And I didn't know who you were.  That's why I didn't pay for it.  Oh, okay.  Ah, see.  Wow, we've been off the...  Wait, we're getting close to being free for a year?  A year?  Not free, but off the premium channel?  Free, right.  But you were doing the trainables audio, and it was friggin' hysterical.  I mean, I thought I was going to wreck all the way home.  I laughed and laughed.  My wife would try to call me.  I'd hang up. 
[00:29:30]  And, oh, interestingly, speaking of my wife, the other day we were watching...  Oh, God.  Happy anniversary, shit dick.  Why don't we send a card?  You are horrible.  Speaking of my wife, I beat it.  Oh, that's terrible.  The guy's one year, very happy, remembers where he was when he found us.  We were that important to him.  Hasn't changed the channel in a year, and he gets hung up on by Opie.  Please, God, let him still be talking.  Sir, that was not me. 
[00:30:00]  I would have respected you and let you continue.  As he's looking at the phone right now, going, what happened?  I hope a truck bumper is approaching him, because he doesn't see the traffic jam ahead of him.  That's the last thing he should think of as he hits that truck.  He's going to tell a boring wife story, though.  Because my wife calls, and she wants me to get off the phone, but I'm going, hon, I'm listening.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Are you?  Are you?  We just didn't need to.  Cha-cha.  Cha-cha-cha.  Oh, hey.  Nutty Jim.  I think I heard Nutty Jim. 
[00:30:30]  No, you didn't.  It's, it's, I think he's trying to poke his way out.  I don't think he's out yet.  Not a new character.  I agree.  No new characters.  Well, he can't do Liddy anymore, because the stupid yogurt doesn't come with the covers anymore.  G-Yogurt Liddy?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't do that anymore.  Speaking of which, G-Yogurt Liddy will be on the show tomorrow.  Oh, really?  We're starting to get, like, real guests on our show.  The real one.  That's kind of strange, yeah.  Not the yogurt Lid.  No.  The Watergate guy.  Yeah.  And also, what, Dale Earnhardt Jr. today? 
[00:31:00]  Yes.  Hey, very good news.  Dick Cheney is taking full responsibility, so that's good.  Well, um.  Whatever that means.  He's going out on a limb.  He was the guy holding the shotgun.  He was the guy that pulled the trigger.  Uh.  And shot another man.  So to take responsibility, that's really stepping up.  Taking responsibility, so that's good.  I guess we could all move on with our lives now.  Yeah.  Because he's taking full responsibility.  I hate when they use that term.  I take full responsibility. 
[00:31:30]  No shit.  You think people nudge each other?  Oh, look, he's taking full responsibility.  He is fessing up to it.  He's not lying and saying he didn't do it.  Has anyone ever taken partial responsibility?  That's what I was getting at.  It was kind of my fault.  Right.  The guy was an asshole.  He was a doddering old idiot who stumbled into my buckshot.  All right.  I'll admit that I was there.  I was on that farm.  And there was some quail in the area.  Yeah.  That's all I'm going to admit today.  That's it.  Took a shot.  I have no idea where it went. 
[00:32:00]  The old guy ran in front of the shot.  So I'm a little confused.  You could blast your buddy away, basically, and no questions asked.  Yeah.  Apparently, if you, let's say me or you or anyone else, went into the woods, went hunting.  Yes.  I was in a sleeping bag outside the tent feeling cold.  You invited me in the tent.  We were both wearing cowboy hats.  Some acoustic guitar music starts.  I can't quit you. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  You're hunting.  And let's say someone pulls the trigger and one of the buddies gets shot.  Yeah.  I shoot Jimmy.  Nutty Jimmy I shoot accidentally.  There doesn't have to be an investigation or anything.  I won't have to sit in front of a grand jury or anything like that.  It just goes away.  I just have to say, I take full responsibility.  I take full responsibility.  Because everyone's treated equally here in this country. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  And it was an accident.  All right.  You're free to go.  You're free to go.  You're free to go.  Someone is saying he's only taking partial responsibility.  Greg in D.C.  He is.  Cheney came out.  And even though he says, it's my fault and I'm taking responsibility, he actually then  said, but he was wearing orange, but he was also wearing brown.  He was low in the brush.  The sun was directly behind him.  He blamed the sun?  Yeah.  He blamed the sun.  He blamed the guy for not saying, excuse me, I'm behind you. 
[00:33:30]  Don't turn and shoot me in the face.  Why did he blame the sun and the guy?  Because they're the same age?  No, no, no.  The sun is in the big yellow thing behind him.  Wow.  Much older than the guy.  I didn't say that.  Wait, that was...  Today, Junior!  What?  Uh-huh.  Uh-oh.  Damn it.  I wanted to make fun of you.  Wrong template.  No.  Yeah.  So Cheney's not taking full responsibility.  Even though he's claiming full responsibility, he's laying the blame everywhere.  You know what the problem is with the instant replay, Opie? 
[00:34:00]  I think your eyes are all fogged up with the cholesterol coming off of E-Rock's breakfast.  What is it?  Holy shit, what are you eating?  Let me see it, Eric.  That I just saw him drench in ketchup.  That is some kind of egg and cheese concoction.  Egg.  Egg.  Potato.  Potatoes and...  Bacon.  And a pig's worth of bacon.  Oh, my God.  It's not just bacon.  That is a lot of bacon.  Usually, people have a couple of strips of bacon.  Sometimes, it's like the bathroom floor in the McCartney household. 
[00:34:30]  Why did I say that?  Okay.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Why did I say that?  Oh, because you're a horrid human being.  That was nutty, Jim.  That wasn't you.  Ah, cha-cha.  Jimmy's not feeling too good about himself right now, are you?  No.  You're feeling a little bit.  At least admit it.  Sometimes you feel like you need a shower as soon as your mouth closes.  At least it doesn't have mayo on it, though.  All right.  Good.  That is a lot of bacon, though.  That is a lot of bacon. 
[00:35:00]  That's going to be a really solid stool you drop out there later.  What's your cholesterol?  It was 207.  207.  207.  That's wonderful.  And you're not even old.  How old are you?  You're not even what?  27.  He's 27.  He's already over 200.  Over 200.  What's healthy cholesterol?  I'm...  170 and under.  That's funny.  Holy shit.  I'm 136.  Thank you.  I just had mine checked.  It's 85.  Jesus Christ.  I swear.  What do you eat?  Notebook paper?  It was 85. 
[00:35:30]  Are you kidding?  I'm not kidding.  Anthony, you have to have some cholesterol.  Coincidentally enough is my weight.  It was 85.  85?  85.  What's wrong with you?  I eat nothing but chicken and broccoli and drink nothing but water.  Occasionally I'll have an oatmeal cookie.  What?  Ooh.  You nut.  Ooh.  What has a lot of cholesterol in it?  I don't think I eat much either. 
[00:36:00]  Look at Iraq and what he's eating.  Mayo.  I don't eat mayo.  This is Iraq talking to his heart.  Is this on?  Is this on?  Is this on?  Wait, eggs or egg whites?  Egg whites are okay, right?  Egg whites, yeah.  He's in the borderline high risk category at 27 years old.  Wow.  That's good, Iraq.  Whew.  200 to 239 is borderline high risk.  High risk starts at 240.  Why don't you stop with the cholesterol, Eric?  Mine was 360 at its highest. 
[00:36:30]  What?  360 with my cholesterol.  Holy shit.  Because then I went on.  My biggest problem was not even my eating or anything.  I went on.  I had high cholesterol because I really ate like shit.  Family history of high cholesterol and shit.  So I went on Accutane because I, silly me, thought once I hit my 30s my acne would go away.  But no, of course not.  So I went on Accutane, which gets rid of it. 
[00:37:00]  It's amazing stuff.  It's completely gone.  Yeah, you should do it when you're a kid, though.  When I first met you, you used to still get the goiters.  Oh, you still get big fucking, like, cystic fucking zits.  It was horrid.  Anthony didn't get the small ones.  No?  No, they were big ones.  It sucked.  And you'd think, you know, into your 30s it's going to go away.  When I was in my teens, I'm like, well, at least, you know, once I hit 20, it'll be gone.  At least I'll grow out of this.  All through 20s, 30s, it just lingers on.  And then finally decided, you know, I'm taking the Accutane. 
[00:37:30]  Any of you kids out there that got the zits really bad, get on the Accutane.  It's great stuff.  But it does have a side effect for the six months you're on it.  Because you're on it for six months.  It elevates your cholesterol.  So you got to go every month to your dermatologist to get your cholesterol checked.  And I already had high cholesterol.  And I was like, Doc, I don't care.  I got to get rid of this.  Just do it.  And so as he's checking every month, it kept going up higher and higher. 
[00:38:00]  I got into the high threes with the cholesterol.  Damn.  And because at that time, I didn't care.  I'm still smoking, eating like shit, drinking.  And it was just awful.  And it never went back down.  So now 85.  I'm happy.  85.  High threes, you actually have to tie off your arm and hit a vein and inject pig grease.  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty much what it was.  Jesus, dude.  That's how I was eating.  All I ate was beef. 
[00:38:30]  The high cholesterol?  Beef.  That's all I ever ate.  Was that bad cholesterol?  And all I drank was beer.  I honestly don't know.  Yeah.  I don't eat much beef.  If you're going to eat beef, you should get a lean cut, they say.  Yeah, and every once in a while.  And every once in a while.  But no, every night it was nothing but beef and fries and a lot of eggs.  And then remember at NEW, Rick would go out and get Burger King or McDonald's.  And I'd be like, yeah, get me a quarter pounder.  Get me an end of cheeseburger and supersized fries.  And you're just like shoving this fucking glue into your system. 
[00:39:00]  Horrid.  Some guy.  Now 85.  Holy fuck.  Kim in Washington.  I want to rub your tummy.  Kim?  Yes, sir.  Kim?  Yep.  560 HDL, 480 LDL.  Nice.  What's HDL, LDL for those that don't know?  Nice.  Nice.  HDL is the bad cholesterol.  LDL is the good cholesterol.  Wow.  You should be like 130 LDL or 130 HDL and like 89 LDL. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, my God.  But then again, I also am a fat fuck, so.  I smell bit.  I smell bit.  Wow.  What?  Cholesterol.  What's your cholesterol?  Hey, everybody.  What's your cholesterol?  We want to know.  Nutty Jim, what's yours?  Kill a million.  That's insane.  My blood sugar was like 790. 
[00:40:00]  Dude, what are you doing?  Your numbers don't add up.  What is wrong with you?  His apartment's going to be up for sale soon.  Yeah, where do you live?  I live in a truck.  That's funny.  He's got a two-bedroom, one-bedroom uses a kitchen.  Yeah.  Well, you know, the scary thing is I'm driving a commercial motor vehicle down the road.  Hey, can you leave your XM unit to maybe an Opie and Anthony fan so we don't lose the sub? 
[00:40:30]  Not a problem.  All right, Kim.  That guy's never lost a sub in his life.  Good luck, bro.  Nobody's going to want his units.  He's going to have, like, fucking grease stains all over it.  Mayo prints.  Let's go to Chris in Texas.  Chris?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  No much.  Actually, I just want to call up Jimmy.  I went to jail this weekend wearing one of your shirts, and people pretty much kicked my ass all weekend.  What was the shirt?  It was the Sharon Tate Got Milk Charlie Manson shirt.  Oh, okay. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  The cops weren't too pleased with it.  I got a lot of ragging on that.  And there was a bunch of guys in the cells that, well, it's fucking Texas, so they're all fucking construction kids down here.  And so, after they figured it out, I had to deal with that shirt.  Well, why'd they get mad at you for a Manson shirt?  Because they saw the swastika on the forehead.  Oh, okay.  That could cause a problem.  The swastika, such a bad rap.  Yeah.  Very hard to wear it in this day and age, no matter what the context.  It used to be a symbol of peace. 
[00:41:30]  Symbol of peace in the American Indian and Asian cultures.  Sometimes upright, sometimes in a counterclockwise direction, but still the familiar swastika.  Doesn't mean good peace and fortune.  Very hard to wear, even in a peaceful fashion these days.  Chris?  Which way is the one in your mantle, Sid?  Up my ass.  Depends on which way you're looking in the mirror.  Sometimes it could.  That sucks, because I wanted to find out why Chris went to jail.  Call back, Chris. 
[00:42:00]  All right, here we go.  Dick Cheney, speaking of bad hearts, cholesterol and all that fun stuff.  He finally talked about the shooting to Britt Hume on Fox News.  On Fox News.  Now, why didn't he go to CNN?  I don't understand that.  Why did he pick Fox News?  Could it be that even though people say that certain news agencies aren't biased, and I'm  talking about CNN also having a liberal slant to it, would he figure that he would get  to speak his piece without much interference on Fox News? 
[00:42:30]  Of course he did.  He was dressed in orange, even dressed properly.  But he was also, there was a little bit of a gully there, so he was down a little ways  below land level.  Although I could see, you know, the upper part of his body when I didn't see it at the time  I shot until after I'd fired.  And the sun was directly behind him.  That affected the vision, too, I'm sure.  But the image of him falling is something I'll never be able to get out of my mind. 
[00:43:00]  I fired and there's Harry falling.  And it was, I'd have to say, one of the worst days of my life at that moment.  Well, how do you think Harry felt after he had a bullet in it and you're running over  yelling, I got one with a hat, I got one with a hat?  Doddering shithead.  And could you give your friend a break and not say, one of the worst days of my life? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, one.  What was worse?  Yeah, could you help your pal out and just say, it was the worst day of my life, even  if you're lying?  One of the worst.  One of the worst.  Does that mean he has shot other people?  Or something that happened that wasn't involved with the shooting bothered him more than almost  murdering his friend in a hunting accident.  Right, right.  One of the worst.  That's wonderful.  Ultimately, I'm the guy who pulled the trigger that fired the round that hit Harry.  And you can talk about all of the other conditions that existed at the time, but that's the bottom 
[00:44:00]  line.  And there's no, it was not Harry's fault.  You can't blame anybody else.  I'm the guy who pulled the trigger and shot my friend.  And I say that something I'll never forget.  Hello, exactly!  How about this stupid?  Stop saying Harry.  Stop, we know his name.  Stop trying to humanize him so you're connecting.  That's a tactic.  You know, Harry, Harry.  There's a connection between, we know he's your friend.  We know you didn't mean to shoot him.  Shut your face.  I shot Harry when Harry met Bullitt. 
[00:44:30]  Shut up.  Harry.  If you knew Harry, like a...  What thought did you give that evening to how this news should be transmitted?  My first reaction, Brett, was not to think I need to call the press.  My first reaction is, my friend Harry's been shot.  And we've got to take care of him.  That evening, there were other considerations.  We wanted to make sure his family was taken care of.  His wife was on the ranch. 
[00:45:00]  She wasn't with us when it happened.  We got her hooked up with the ambulance on the way to the hospital with Harry.  He has grown children.  We wanted to make sure they were notified so they didn't hear on television that their father had been shot.  That was important, too.  But we also didn't know what the outcome here was going to be.  We didn't know for sure what kind of shape Harry was in.  We had preliminary reports, but they wanted to do a CAT scan, for example, to see how, whether or not there was any internal damage, whether or not any vital organ had been penetrated by any of the shot. 
[00:45:30]  We did not know until Sunday morning that we could be confident that everything was probably going to be okay.  I didn't really count from the beginning, but I'm guessing there were six Harry's.  Just in that clip?  In one of the two clips together, there was six Harry's.  Harry.  Harry.  My friend Harry.  My friend Harry.  Well, Harry was in the brush.  It's a little weird when he says we weren't sure how this was going to play out or whatever.  Harry.  Yeah.  You know, he wasn't sure if, you know, maybe there'd have to be a major cover-up. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, wow.  And that's why he was waiting.  Just Harry Harry and that gully he was in walk away.  We never saw him that day.  Harry.  He was supposed to meet us for hunting, but, uh.  Hey, we started hunting together, and he just wandered off into the woods.  He went off.  We think he just lost his mind.  We looked for a few hours, but.  The Vice President can't cover up a body.  No one can.  Come on.  Right.  He's got people.  We'll take care of this, sir.  We'll take care of this, sir.  Secret Service probably has a code for it. 
[00:46:30]  We have a downed quail.  We have a downed quail.  All right.  Good old Harry never existed.  Yeah.  Nope.  That's it.  Operation Disappear Harry.  And even his own children say, hey, uh, no, we don't.  We never had a father named Harry.  Calls up Marcellus Wallace.  Right.  Negro, that's all you had to say.  And the wolf will be there shortly.  All right.  What do we got here?  A hunter shot in the face. 
[00:47:00]  Gentlemen, I'm going to need you to clean up the area.  Fucking Dick Cheney walks into the White House wearing those crappy clothes from Pulp Fiction.  You look like a couple of dorks.  You have to hose them down naked in the backyard.  I'm sure you've both been a lockup, gentlemen.  You know what?  I hate when we miss the obvious answer to something or the obvious joke.  Uh-huh.  Brian from North Carolina is going to make us all look stupid.  Brian?  What's up, guys?  Hey. 
[00:47:30]  Hey.  Cheney's worst day was when he found out his daughter was a lesbian.  There you go.  Take care, boys.  There you go.  Now it all makes sense.  So, Dick, when you drove up here, did you see a sign that said, Dead Harry Storage?  So, it would have been funny if they said, Mr. Vice President, what was your worst day?  And if he just kind of hinted to it, he goes, well, I was talking to my daughter, and I smelled something on her breath, and then I went, hey. 
[00:48:00]  Hey.  It's trout.  We finally have something in common.  Because storing dead Harry's ain't my fucking business, okay, Dick?  It does raise the question of whether you couldn't have headed off this Beltway firestorm if you had put out the word to the national media as well as to the local newspaper so that it could post it on its website.  In retrospect, it would not have been the wiser course.  Well, who's going to do that? 
[00:48:30]  Are they going to take my word for what happened?  There is, obviously.  Well, obviously, you could have put the statement out in the name of whoever you wanted, and you could put it out in the name of Mrs. Armstrong, too.  And obviously, she's the one who made the statement.  Exactly.  That's what we did.  We went with Mrs. Armstrong.  She's the one who put out the statement, and she was the most credible one to do it because she was a witness.  It wasn't me in terms of saying here's what happened.  You mean to tell me that in order to hit a quail that is flying left to right that you have... 
[00:49:00]  Oh, shit.  I shot Harry in the face.  That is some repugnant shit.  That is some fucked-up repugnant shit.  And just the arrogance of the media.  Like, they should be notified first.  You hear this pompous piece of shit talking about it?  Yeah.  There wasn't any way this was going to be minimized, Britt, but it was important that it be accurate.  But I do think what I've experienced over the years here in Washington is as the media outlets have proliferated, 
[00:49:30]  speed has become sort of a driving force lots of times at the expense of accuracy.  And I wanted to make sure we got it as accurate as possible.  Well, you've gotten your shot accurate.  And I think Catherine was an excellent choice.  I don't know who you could get better as the basic source for the story than the witness who saw the whole thing.  Man, he uses the media to his advantage.  What is he talking about?  Yeah, right when it happened, they went into spin control right there on the spot. 
[00:50:00]  You know, I'm sure Harry's laying there.  Cheney travels with a medical team, so they were on him, taking care of him.  I'm sure they were alerting a hospital and everything.  And all Dick Cheney and his other people were doing was, all right, how are we going to deal with this?  This is a big fucking story.  So it was all spelt out.  It wasn't just one of these things, well, I was thinking about Harry.  And there are people, it's their job to keep things under wraps for 18 hours or so. 
[00:50:30]  Protect the vice president so it doesn't come out sounding.  That's why the whole thing sounded so nothing when it first came out.  If they had released it right away, without any details or anything, oh my God, the vice president shot somebody.  That's all we know.  So they wanted it to sound very, eh, peppered him with a few shots.  It's okay.  It happens all the time.  Meanwhile, we know it was a little more serious.  And what's the latest on good old Harry? 
[00:51:00]  Ah, he seems to be sitting up and eating.  And working.  They said he's doing a little of his lawyer work.  And, eh, who knows.  They're going to leave all the pellets in him.  He's got somewhere between 10 and 500.  I don't know what they said.  10 and 100.  Something ridiculous.  Kind of sitting around.  Just kind of moving around.  Rocking and rolling.  Be fun at the airport.  Moving over here a little bit.  Going to get on a plane every time.  Coming back over here.  I'm Harry.  Remember?  News.  I was shot. 
[00:51:30]  Vice president.  That's why I'm beeping through the metal detector.  Can I get on the fucking plane?  That's why I'm beeping like a pinball machine.  Get right by his chest and head.  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Well, let's see what Leno had to say about this whole thing.  My favorite story.  Well, today Dick Cheney finally answered questions about the hunting accident on Fox News.  You know, I think Fox is a little biased.  They called it interview with a marksman.  See, I seem, you know, I seem a little biased. 
[00:52:00]  No, in this interview today with Brit Hume, Dick Cheney took full responsibility for shooting a fellow hunter.  Then surprisingly, now this really amazes me, he broke down and admitted to killing two drifters in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1989.  Two drifters.  Two drifters.  Two drifters, yeah.  You know, I'm not sure I buy Cheney's excuse.  You hear why, did you hear this, why it happened, why he did it?  Well, he explained that this whole thing started years ago when he received a heart transplant from a convicted killer. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, that's what it was.  See, and that led, that led all of this.  We're going to go into game mode today.  Don't worry, we're going to have a fine show.  All right, let me go.  That's hot.  I got blood rushing in my mule right now.  That is so hot.  Hey, look at my cock.  Waka waka penis.  Boing, boing, boing.  Insta boner.  Something touched my ball.  Jim Norton.  Well, just go ahead.  Give me your cock.  Can I fuck you?  Why not?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Where everybody goes to get young boys. 
[00:53:00]  I'm a young boy.  Pick me.  Good God, you're believable.  What do you mean?  Look how slender you are.  Ugh.  What?  You can leave some of those thoughts in your head.  I mean.  I did.  That was the edited version.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Saturday Radio.  The ONA virus spreading across America, slowly but surely. 
[00:53:30]  The help of the fans and the pests.  They all do fine jobs.  Can I say hello to the girls on PalTalk?  I'm looking at right now.  There's three of them.  All very lovely.  Yeah, the PalTalk is just taking over the world.  Taking over this show.  Other people are not happy that PalTalk is taking over the show.  It's not really taking over the show.  It's just a nice little great addition.  It's a great addition.  And it lets the show continue after the show is over. 
[00:54:00]  Last night, over 600 people in one of the rooms just having a blast.  It's because of my new hairdo.  People come around to see the man's new hairdo.  They were waiting for Nutty Jim to come into the room, and he never made an appearance.  Yeah, he's kind of typing away.  Busy.  Nutty Jim.  Yeah, we were saying this yesterday.  It's not about a four-hour show anymore.  No.  It's kind of like a lifestyle.  The show just continues after we're off the air.  It's just unbelievable what this has become. 
[00:54:30]  And we want to thank you guys for that.  The pests are great, and we'll talk about it later, but there was some Frederica Bimmel references on a certain program last night.  You know what?  We'll do that a little later this hour.  Yeah.  Okay.  I didn't hear it because I was getting a massage, and I had, I think, a finger up to the knuckle embedded in my rectum.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was impressive.  Can you still smell it on your E-Ruck?  That's what got cholesterol in it.  You shouldn't have licked your finger after. 
[00:55:00]  Wait, what was that about?  You can't just say that and let it go.  Sure, you can.  You got a massage?  Yeah, what?  Fingers slipped in.  No one was looking.  Girl came over.  I went there.  Oh, you went there?  Yes.  That's dangerous, isn't it?  Yeah.  What if there's a raid?  Let there be.  Let there be.  You don't care.  You got me.  She's got me like a popsicle.  She can carry me to jail.  How embarrassing.  No.  For me?  All right.  You're under arrest.  Ah.  Remove your finger from that gentleman's asshole.  Both of you come with me. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  That would really embarrass me if I got busted with a girl with a finger on my ass.  Yeah.  I would love it.  I would call the press and hope someone picked it up.  Massage with a knuckle.  Yeah.  All right.  Why'd you decide to venture out instead of have them come over at your place?  I'd do both.  You'd do both.  Sure.  Wow.  I'm crazy.  It's such-  We like to just mix it up.  Yeah.  For Jimmy, it's like either going out to eat or calling in for delivery.  It's as easy as we do that with food. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  You know, he'd call, yeah, send over, I don't know, pizza or, what, you want to go out with  Chinese tonight?  We'll go to the Chinese place.  I want Asian.  That's Jimmy.  He got Asian last night.  It's such, yeah, I think I want Italian tonight.  And it's, that's just how you look at, sometimes you want to go out to eat at these bitches.  Other times you want to stay home.  That's amazing.  That's amazing.  That's amazing.  Right, Jimmy?  Sometimes you want to, you want a little meal at home.  Other times you want to be humiliated on the massage table at another person's residence.  Right. 
[00:56:30]  Well, very good.  All right.  You guys watching the Olympics in between this stuff?  Yeah, constantly.  It's been really exciting.  I, I'm sorry.  I cannot catch it.  I have not seen one minute of Olympic coverage.  I don't know when it's on.  I haven't looked for it.  There are other things on that I watch.  Well, NBC is just fucking it all up.  They have to show these events live.  This has got to be the lowest rated Olympics ever.  Well, we said this the other day too.  It's like in this day and age, you could get the Olympic, you know, results wherever you 
[00:57:00]  look.  Uh-huh.  You sign online, bam, there's all the gold medal winners.  You walk outside here in New York, they got Olympic results on the top of taxis.  Yeah, the cabs.  You can't avoid it.  Cabs got TVs on them over here in New York and you look and boom, there it is, results.  And NBC all day long will tease, did Blah Blah win the gold?  Wait till tonight to find out.  Wait till tonight.  As you're saying that, it's scrolling across your own fucking screen.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  But I did check out some hockey. 
[00:57:30]  They had the hockey games on live yesterday.  That was very exciting.  Oh, they did.  The only reason to watch the Winter Olympics is for Olympic hockey.  You know, like the figure skating seems to be the big draw for the Winter Olympics.  For the women and the faggots.  Yeah, that's right.  No, it's all about Olympic hockey.  Hockey.  Hockey.  Because the rinks are wider and so the game is much faster, a lot more action.  No black players is what you're saying?  Wider.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  See, I misunderstood.  Players leave their wallets on the bench, no problem. 
[00:58:00]  There is a black speed skater that they're making a big deal about just because he's black.  Like he might be the first black speed skater or something.  All right, that sport's gone.  Let's move on to the next one.  Figure eight ball.  Yeah, what sport is left for us?  Nothing.  Law school and computers.  I don't know, Jimmy the Greek.  Explain why they're better at these sports, could you? 
[00:58:30]  You see, we're back in the slave days.  All right, Jimmy.  Bye.  Goodbye.  Bye forever, Jimmy.  I'm fired.  But the USA, very disappointing tie yesterday to a country that I don't know about.  What are the red crushes?  Moldovia?  What was the name of the country that tied the United States yesterday?  Anybody?  I'm assuming.  They didn't have an Ovia at the end of it?  I'm assuming it's one of the now Russian old Soviet bloc countries that are now. 
[00:59:00]  I think it's one of these new Russian colonies.  And Akia?  Latvia.  Oh, Latvia.  You know Latvia?  One of the hottest strippers I ever met was from Latvia, yes.  You don't know where Latvia is?  I do.  I actually did a scene with White Chicks Incorporated with a stripper from Latvia.  All right, where is it?  It's near Russia.  I don't know exactly where it is, but it's near Russia.  Yeah, it is.  Do we even know if it's...  No, it wouldn't be near Russia.  It would be part of the old Russia.  Well, yeah, which means it's probably near where Russia is.  Well, what part of the old Russia?  The left. 
[00:59:30]  The left-hand side.  Yeah, it's...  And do we have to go back to school to learn all the new countries?  Yeah.  It used to be a lot easier when we were growing up.  There was just Russia.  Now there's, what, 10 things that used to be Russia?  I like when it was just...  Or individual countries?  CCCP.  Someone help us out.  That's it.  Where the hell is Latvia and what is it about?  All right.  Find out what Latvia is all about there, Iraq.  Do some research.  Yeah, please.  Let's see.  I'm not...  Latvia seems to be between Estonia, Russia, Belarus, and Lithuania, right off the Gulf of 
[01:00:00]  Regia.  Regia, right.  And the Baltic Sea.  Yep.  It is a coastal country.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Not landlocked.  No, no, not landlocked.  Very important, I guess, to Russia because it would give Russia an extra port.  And a lot of people, they said some of the greatest sea shanties come from Latvia.  Sea shanties.  And what do they port?  I don't know, but there's a river going through it.  What are they sending out or taking in from that port? 
[01:00:30]  I'm sure horrid things.  American blue jeans and toilet paper.  Vodka and borscht and all they ship out.  Strippers.  Broke idiots.  Fucking big container ships full of strippers bound for New York.  Let me just water down the container.  All right, let's say hi to Jim in Florida.  Jim?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi.  I saw that black speed skater on TV and typically, he's already fucked everything up.  What do you mean? 
[01:01:00]  He put some patch on his shirt or his little skin-tight suit from some German bank that wasn't supported by the United States Olympic Committee.  Oops.  So he threw all their funding from him and his black bombs on there raising hell about how he's being mistreated.  He won't take the patch off.  They said, they're not one of our corporate sponsors.  We paid for you since you were a little kid to learn how to speed skate.  And now you're fucking us.  And he's just got a shitty attitude already.  The man's coming down on him because it won't make him take his patch off his suit.  So apparently, it seems he's getting money from this bank. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  And they're not a partner.  And they're not a partner.  So...  Would you say he's getting uppity?  Oh, Jesus.  That's a big word to use.  He was doing what he was told, but his mom was typical black pit.  Yeah.  Leave the black speed skater alone.  Leave him alone.  One black speed skater.  Leave him alone.  Take the patch off.  Yeah.  Steve in Jersey, what's up?  I taped that stupid game yesterday and walked around my house in silence for two hours after 
[01:02:00]  I got home from work.  What?  The hockey game, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just to wait and watch it.  Made the mistake of checking my email before the game.  Bang.  The score pops up.  Yeah.  You can't.  All night.  You can't.  I had a whole night plan.  The wife was out of work.  He's pissed.  I had a whole night planned dinner and hockey.  Ruined.  You can't avoid it.  So what is NBC doing?  It stinks.  Although, I mean, the games were on live, but you had to find them deep in your cable system.  I think the game was on 174. 
[01:02:30]  Sir, you deserve to have your night ruined.  If your idea of a big night is to fucking VCR Olympic hockey and have a fucking pizza,  your night should be spoiled.  Jimmy, you're out of time.  The Olympic hockey is very exciting.  I'm telling you.  Jimmy, sometimes sports and a good meal, like if you want to watch maybe a basketball game  and you have a big prime rib and you want to eat it, and let's say a dog comes by and  eats your prime rib, that's very disappointing.  And sometimes you have to kill that dog.  I'm not saying you can't watch Olympic hockey, but to plan an evening around it and go, all 
[01:03:00]  right, I'm going to watch this.  The Olympics is just shit.  Who cares?  Jimmy, people do this type of stuff.  I know, but we shouldn't interact with these countries.  They hate us.  They tape their favorite sporting event and watch it some other time.  Maybe this guy works a couple jobs and he wasn't home when it was on, right?  Yeah, exactly.  And that's why I'm ditching work today.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Later, boys.  Hey, so there's a bad boy of figure skating. 
[01:03:30]  Bad boy of figure skating.  And they're calling him.  This isn't our name for him.  They're really trying.  The media is calling this guy the bad boy of figure skating.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  They're trying.  This is the Olympics and this guy and everyone got together and they're trying to change the  image of the male figure skater by, look, look, there's a bad boy.  We got us a bad boy.  No, you don't.  A bad boy of figure skating.  That means he saw a vagina and didn't throw up. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  And he's the bad boy.  There is no bad boy of figure skating.  There's also a bad boy of chess out there.  There is actually Bobby Fischer.  Checkmate, motherfucker.  I mean, this guy is a faggot.  How do you become the bad boy of figure skating?  You're a sissy is what they would call you back in the old days.  A sissy.  A girly boy.  What makes you a bad boy?  You're a sissy, but every once in a while you go, hey, look at the tits on her.  What does he do? 
[01:04:30]  What makes you the bad boy of figure skating is what I need to know.  Holds the girl up over his head and goes, he is a bad boy.  Holds her up in the air and just whispers, nice snatch.  Nice snatch.  Doesn't whisper.  Yells it.  He's a bad boy.  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, and the whole audience.  Oh, did I just hear that right?  Did he look at her snatch and say, nice snatch?  He is the bad boy of figure skating.  Jim, no wonder they call him the bad boy of figure skating.  Look at him go.  Right. 
[01:05:00]  Well, you want to hear some audio from the bad boy of figure skating?  Please.  All right.  Here we go.  And the first track is labeled, people should be scared of me.  All right.  Is this him, by the way?  I think that might be, yeah.  See, they're talking about him right now on TV.  Here he is.  The bad boy of figure skating.  Back in the short program, Johnny Weir warming up.  He's rapidly become on and off the ice, one of the most entertaining men in skating. 
[01:05:30]  A loose cannon to skating officials, a bit eccentric to family and friends, but most of all, a man comfortable with himself.  People tend to think that I'm putting on an act, but that's just me.  I've been raised.  What are you laughing at, Anthony?  You're showing him on TV.  That's the bad boy?  That's the bad boy of figure skating.  Dude, that looks like a fucking woman.  It looks like Joyce DeWitt. 
[01:06:00]  Watch out.  Watch out.  The bad boy of figure skating is coming to get you.  Oh, is he mad?  Oh, my God, stop it.  That is the furthest thing.  You could show this video to a gazillion people.  The last words out of their mouth would be, bad boy.  I think the top of the list would be eight gazillion faggots.  He looks like a fucking Marilyn Manson album cover with that fucking awful, short, androgynous hair. 
[01:06:30]  He's a faggot.  And his outfit.  Good skit.  Wait, is he trying to blow himself in that last move?  I think he's trying isn't even the word there, Opie.  I think he did.  A fan?  What is this?  His outfit is supposed to represent a swan.  A swan.  Or is it a goose?  The red glove is supposed to be the beak.  The beak.  I get it.  And the feathers are trailing down his bones.  It is known as the bad bird of the bird world.  Or a cock.  A cock.  You know, I've known a lot of bad boys in my lifetime, 
[01:07:00]  and not once did any of them reference themselves to a fowl.  No, no.  Never said, I'm dressing like a goose today.  Because I'm a bad boy.  Jimmy's been a silly goose some days.  I certainly have been.  I've never seen him come in dressed like that.  That guy is gay for a figure skater, by the way.  That was very gay for a figure skater.  Never mind the bad boy.  Yeah.  Well, let's start the clip.  Sorry, I finally saw him, and I lost it. 
[01:07:30]  Back in the short program, Johnny Weir warming up.  He's rapidly become, on and off the ice,  one of the most entertaining men in skating.  A loose cannon to skating officials,  a bit eccentric to family and friends,  but most of all, a man comfortable with himself.  People tend to think that I'm putting on an act.  But that's just me.  I've been raised to be outspoken,  to have my own thoughts.  I've never seen a point in pleasing other people. 
[01:08:00]  I know that a lot of people,  especially the more Republican-style people,  are very afraid of what I mean to the sport  and what I'm going to say,  what kind of revolutionary, crazy thing  is going to come out of my mouth.  And it's no good for them.  They should be scared.  He's colorful.  I'm not a good little figure skater  that goes to bed at 8.30 every night,  wakes up at 6.30,  eats my three meals, and goes to bed again.  I'm a real person. 
[01:08:30]  I do real things.  Oh, he's adorable.  Oh my God.  He's as cute as a puggle.  You are the cutest little thing.  They call him a loose cannon,  because whenever he sees naked men,  he shoots in his pants.  You know what the funny part  about his little comment there  was the fact that he thinks  the Republican types are afraid of him  because he's so outspoken  and might say things that are going to shatter  this image of male figure skaters. 
[01:09:00]  Like, no, we know you're gay.  It's not an issue.  Have fun with it.  You know, be gay.  Be a figure skater.  Yeah, bad boy.  He's flamboyant.  It's not like a football player  coming out and going,  this is going to shake shit up  because I'm gay,  and people don't like the idea  of gay football players,  and there's a lot more of us out there  and stuff.  No, you're a figure skater.  Yeah.  If you're gay in football  and the toughest guy on the field,  then, you know,  that's something.  Yeah.  But when you watch figure skating... 
[01:09:30]  That could be a high school girl.  When you watch figure skating,  you just have to assume  you're watching a lot of gay people.  Right.  You know you are.  Right.  The shocking ones  are the ones that you see,  and I know there was one couple  that was actually, like, hooked up,  either married or boyfriend and girlfriend,  doing figure skating.  And when I heard that,  I was like,  get the fuck out of here.  That guy is fucking her.  That was shocking.  And at the end of that clip,  as he's talking about 
[01:10:00]  what a badass he is,  they cut to him in his car,  and you can hear him listening  to what a girl wants.  Oh, classic.  Yep.  That's fantastic.  Nice costume there  in that picture, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Baby blue with some darker blue.  Do you guys want to hear another clip  from the bad boy of figure skating?  Stop it, Opie.  That might be too much.  I don't know.  Alan.  I can't wait any longer.  Alan from Arkansas, real fast. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, you guys rock.  I just want to let you know  here in Little Rock,  there's nothing like it.  This is Arkansas,  home of the President Clinton Library  and Presidential Sperm Bank.  Thanks.  Right on, man.  Thanks for listening to us, Alan.  All right.  Stern sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get Johnny Weir, I said.  Get Johnny Weir on a phone.  Open your fucking ears, jackass.  Inside the mind of Johnny Weir.  Look, jerky.  I don't need to fuck you.  Oh, God. 
[01:11:00]  What a favorite film.  I'm looking at his favorites.  Dude, he's a faggot squared.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Here's some of his favorites.  Of his ten favorite songs,  five are by Christina Aguilera.  Same with his outfits.  He counts Moulin Rouge,  Hedwig,  and the Angry Inch,  Velvet Goldmine,  and The Bodyguard 
[01:11:30]  as his favorite films.  By the way,  Hedwig and the Angry Inch  was the name of  Jim Norton's massage therapist  last night.  The Angry Inch.  Wait, the next one.  The space between  the tip of the finger  and the knuckle.  There's the Angry Inch.  The next one is the shock.  Yeah, here's the giveaway.  His favorite comedian,  Margaret Cho.  Of course it is.  Yeah, a favorite  amongst gay guys.  Oh, they love her.  His favorite books,  The Devil Wears Prada  and Nicole Richie's  The Truth About Diamonds.  Oh, he's bad. 
[01:12:00]  He's bad.  Oh, he loves, uh...  He loves...  He loves polar bears.  Grr.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Grr.  Grr.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's dancing to this on ice.  Oh, look at the spin.  And he lands the double  Saucal.  An amazing performance  by Johnny Weir  to this very original music.  I told him to do a pirouette. 
[01:12:30]  He models his awful  fucking faggity outfits  after Steve's tattoos.  I love polar bears.  His signature quote?  Yeah.  Can I suck your cock?  Oh, wait, no.  People ask me  if I'm in love with you  because I'm sitting here  with your picture  and smiling to myself.  I'm kind of lost  in my thoughts of you.  My heart speaks  before my mind thinks  through  and I blush  as I say yes.  This kid's dangerous. 
[01:13:00]  Christina Aguilera.  That kid is the real deal.  That is the bad boy  of figure skating.  Is that what that quote's from?  I thought that was  right out of the Warriors.  Don't tangle  with this young lad.  Oh, he's a ruffian.  Well, we got another  soundbite  from the bad boy  of figure skating.  Oh, I don't know, man.  Talking about  how he's not a diva.  I'm not going to be  the shiny, sparkly,  flower-holding figure skater  that sits here  and says,  I want to do my best today  and if I don't,  then I'll go home  and train really hard  and do better next time.  That's not me. 
[01:13:30]  I think if figure skating  was any more mainstream,  it would be  a whole lot more boring.  I'm going to be  really angry  if I skate bad  and I probably  will say crazy things.  His was more like  a vodka shot,  let's snort coke  kind of program.  That's how I rock it.  I'm not for everybody.  There are going to be  people that like you  and people that hate you  and there's nothing  I can do. 
[01:14:00]  I don't think I'm a diva  or pompous enough  to be in the position  of acting like a diva.  But I like things  to be the way  I like them to be.  Whenever a man  claims he's not a diva,  he loves cock.  Wow.  Have we ever had to defend  that we might be divas?  I'm not a diva.  No.  Oh, well, we have actually  with the milk diva 
[01:14:30]  and the coffee diva.  You know something?  I've never heard of this  bad boy of figure skating.  I saw the CD sitting there  for a while.  I heard the stories  and stuff,  but I never heard him.  And I assumed  that I was going to hear  something like  one of the interviews  from the X Games,  one of those kind of guys,  like completely out of context  as a figure skater  because he's the bad boy  of figure skating.  I pictured one of those  snowboarder-type attitudes, 
[01:15:00]  BMX guys,  something.  This guy is every figure skater  ever, ever, ever.  But gayer.  Gayer.  He is not the bad boy  of figure skating.  He's like Nadia Comaneci.  That's what he reminds me of.  Little svelte body.  How do you not love him?  I smell bit.  Yeah?  Let's take phone calls.  Who do you think  is the bad boy  of figure skating?  Oh, they're so many  to choose from.  I couldn't name 
[01:15:30]  another male figure skater.  Exactly.  I couldn't either.  I couldn't even name one.  Let's go to the phones.  Brian Boitano?  Brian Boitano.  There you go.  Let's go to the phones.  Let's say hi to Scott  in West Virginia.  Scott.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, when this guy  won the national championship  to qualify for the Olympics  in his closing interview,  he said that he felt  like the prettiest flower  on the pond.  You know,  now you've got to give him 
[01:16:00]  the title of bad boy.  Now he's just stealing  what Jimmy said  about himself last week.  That's right.  Exactly.  Ha-cha-cha.  That's nutty Jim.  I'm sorry.  Nutty Jim.  The bad boy brings out  that craziness.  I have to compete.  Well, we've got the bad boy  of figure skating on the line.  Yes.  Hi, boys.  How are you?  All right.  Johnny Weir,  how are you doing?  I'm very, very good.  I just got to tell Jimmy,  Jimmy, I think I may have  left my ring  in your tuckus list.  Oh, now you didn't tell us,  Jim, that it was  the bad boy of figure skating  that had his knuckles.  I just want to say this to Jimmy. 
[01:16:30]  Ha-ha.  That was Hedwig  and the Angry Inch  calling in.  The Angry Inch.  We have one more clip  of the bad boy of figure skating.  Oh, thank goodness.  This is when he gets really saucy,  so watch out.  Uh-oh.  Watch out, everybody.  Dangerous.  He's bad.  He's bad.  It's really my own game  and my own agenda  that I'm going for  and to live my life  as happy as I can be. 
[01:17:00]  I'm not out there  to be a puppet for anyone.  My harshest critic  would probably just say  that I'm full of air and fluff  and I don't mean things  that I carry.  He's a puppet.  But for now,  my critics can eat it.  Ooh.  I want people to remember me  as someone that pushed  the envelope,  pushed the boundaries  of the United States  figure skating establishment.  Establishment.  I can't change  anyone's mind about me 
[01:17:30]  except my own.  and I'm happy  with who Johnny Weir is.  Like when people speak.  Oh, those guys are facts!  Thank you, Jeff McCauley.  I wasn't sure about that.  Wow.  They have his favorite songs,  his favorite comedian.  They forgot to mention  his favorite disease  and his favorite moments  in Chariots of Fire  to jerk off to.  Fucking creep.  Three simple words. 
[01:18:00]  I am gay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of figured that out.  Yeah.  He pushed the envelope  of what the church considers  acceptable lifestyle behavior.  Right.  All right.  There you go.  Wow.  He is a bad boy.  You got to give him that.  You got to give him that.  Oh, my God.  This could be good.  Justin on Long Island.  Justin!  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Jimmy Norton,  you did not go to a glory hole  and blow a guy like Johnny Weir  like that.  See ya! 
[01:18:30]  Let's go to Kyle in Virginia.  Skating lessons.  Dancing lessons.  I was going to make him  a big star.  Kyle in Virginia.  I was going to make him  a big flower in a pond.  Sorry.  Yeah, I just wanted to  let you guys know  about this Sunday.  It's Steak and BJ Day.  The man's version  of Valentine's Day.  Is it really?  Well, that's an old school  radio bit. 
[01:19:00]  Who's doing  Steak and BJ?  I don't know.  I just heard it down  in North Carolina.  Did you?  Yeah, it's an old radio bit  that many, many, many, many,  many, many, many, many,  many, many, many shows do.  I can't tell Johnny Weir  he doesn't get that swan suit.  Oh, we got Seymour  on the line.  Seymour.  Hey, how you doing?  I'm Seymour.  I'm here to shake things up  in the world  of dual bobsledding.  You know, I know  it's a really rough sport,  but I'm trying to,  you know, 
[01:19:30]  I don't know,  change things up  a little bit,  you know.  You know,  I know it's a tough guy persona,  but, you know,  I don't know.  I just like sliding up  behind another guy there.  And I'm just a pretty slow.  Are you trying to say  you're the bad boy  of bobsledding?  I'm the bad boy  of bobsledding.  I know that people  look at that sport  and say,  my God,  these boys,  they're so rough  and tough, you know.  He's got a great voice for it.  Should have been  the bad boy  of two-man luge.  Yeah, of course.  Bobsledding is like  you're just kind of  sitting in a big sled. 
[01:20:00]  Great idea,  awful execution.  You know,  new rule  for the rest of the show.  Yeah.  If you want on the program,  you got to admit  you're the bad boy  of something.  Bad boy.  That's right.  New rule.  You can't just  get on the phone.  You got to tell us  what you're the bad boy at.  Eric's the bad boy  of cholesterol.  I'm going to turn  the cholesterol world  on its head.  Yes.  They're going to love it.  I'm going to turn it  over on its arteries.  Sean.  His cholesterol is  a million five  and he won't stop eating.  Sean.  He eats mayo  out of assholes. 
[01:20:30]  I'm going to keep  eating bacon,  eggs,  potatoes fried in oil.  That's right.  I fuck a burger.  I wrap my dick in mayo  and I fuck a burger.  You're going to laugh  at cholesterol.  Sean.  Hardy, har, har, hardy.  Sean.  Johnny Weir,  cock diva.  Very good.  All right.  Maybe we should  take a break.  Greg, New York.  Is it true Irox  coming in dressed  as a steak tomorrow?  Greg?  Yeah.  What's up?  Opie, what's going on  with 12 Soda Kenny?  I mean, I was hearing 
[01:21:00]  the updates yesterday  and just wondering  what's going on with him.  Yeah, no updates today,  I guess.  No, there's his hearing.  Later in the month  and then we'll know  a lot more.  I haven't talked to him.  Opie, this is why I'm calling  because I know  what it's like.  I mean, I've worked  for the town of Huntington  for like 16 years.  I mean, you and I  go way back  from your days at BAB.  I know what it's like,  you know,  to have to fight  for your rights  and fight for your job  and fight for free speech  and the whole nine yards.  I just, you know,  I just hope, you know,  I get to see him again 
[01:21:30]  and know their appearance.  I'm going to show you  how good I am right now.  Oh, no, you're not naming  this guy.  This is, stop, Greg.  Yeah, the man on the street, Opie.  This is the guy  that is very famous  for being the first online  at many, many, many media events.  Am I right, Greg?  You're absolutely right, Opie.  Thank you.  Really?  We even go way back  to the days of the XFL.  I miss the XFL.  This guy, like,  you know when there's a big thing 
[01:22:00]  where you have to wait online?  The news crews  always interview this guy.  Oh.  And they're barely onto him.  First online guy?  First online guy  and I see his face  over and over again.  I'm like,  the media has to figure  this out eventually.  This is what he's known for.  Name some of the things  you were like  first in line for.  Okay.  President Clinton's appearance.  first in line  for the World Series.  One of the first people  inside to see  Garth Brooks  and Cheryl Crow  in Central Park. 
[01:22:30]  You're the bad boy  of line standing.  Dude,  how do you learn  to hold shits  and pisses forever?  I go way back  to like when Freddie  does the Yankee games  and even our boy  Deion Rich,  you know,  the guy who's always  getting into like,  you know,  Super Bowls all the time  and always being around  the famous people.  I mean,  we missed him this year.  We haven't heard  from him at all.  Isn't that weird though?  This is what he's known for.  I'm telling you.  What else?  I mean,  he's done this  dozens and dozens of times.  How do you know  how early he gets there? 
[01:23:00]  He makes the paper  all the time.  Like,  you know,  here's a super fan  blah, blah.  What's your last name again,  Greg?  Packer.  Yeah,  that's right.  Packer.  How do you get there so early?  What do you do?  Do you know how many hours  you got to get there?  Yeah,  I figure out how many hours  I got to get there,  how much time I got to put in,  how I got to sleep out,  you know,  the whole night.  You know when like  the president goes to like  a fast food restaurant  like Clinton did it?  Yeah.  All of a sudden  he's eating a burger  next to this guy.  No,  right,  Greg?  Right.  That was one of your big ones.  I mean,  also like opening day 
[01:23:30]  for the Yankees,  opening day for the Mets,  you know.  You know those events  where the local news  is all over  and they want to  interview the fans?  This guy is interviewed  all the time  for being the first guy.  What's the longest  you've waited on the line?  I would say  about three days  for Yankee tickets  for the World Series.  Where do you take dumps,  dude?  Do you do this alone?  I got to do it alone.  I mean,  usually,  you know,  people,  you know,  look out for me.  I mean,  you know,  go inside like,  say,  the bowling alley  bathroom and,  you know.  Is it true  the news is finally 
[01:24:00]  on to you?  Unfortunately so,  Opie.  I mean,  all that's left for me  is,  you know,  maybe,  you know,  have a place  on your show.  Yeah.  I don't know  if you can get us tickets.  I mean,  the town is on to me.  I mean,  you know,  unfortunately,  you know,  you know from  Clubs of the Kennedy,  there's too many rats  in the world.  Too many rats  who stick their nose  where it don't belong.  You know what,  this is what,  this is what I'll promise you,  Greg.  You'll be the last person  on our show.  I'll give you that.  Last?  I thought I'd be... 
[01:24:30]  You just got to know  when that day is,  though.  Yeah.  That'll be up to you.  Okay, Opie.  You'll be the last person  on our show.  But then again,  Greg,  if you wait online,  would you be willing  to wear Opie and Anthony  gear under your...  Oh,  absolutely,  yeah.  either Opie and Anthony  gear or even,  you know,  like for when we got  Mets,  Yankees opening day,  you know.  All right,  now we're on to something,  Jimmy.  We're on to something.  Yeah,  maybe you could get  some Opie and Anthony  mentioned into these  casual discussions  on the air.  Oh,  absolutely.  I mean,  you know,  give a shout out to you, 
[01:25:00]  even give a shout out  to Club Soda Kenny,  too.  I mean...  What were some of the  other ones you got  coverage for?  I'm telling you,  he's got to have  a ton of articles.  Ton.  Yeah,  it's been a Newsday,  Daily News,  Post,  MSNBC,  Keith Olbin  did a piece on me.  I mean,  Ann Coulter,  I mean,  Ann Coulter's been  pretty critical about me.  I can't figure out why.  Yeah,  why?  What's the problem?  I don't understand  what the controversy is. 
[01:25:30]  What could she possibly...  What was her problem  with you?  He is the bad boy  of line standing.  Why don't we ask  Kim McCartney herself?  I mean,  ask her herself,  bring her on the show,  and let's find out  what her problem is.  And let's find out  what Ann Coulter's problem is.  Yeah.  Well,  yeah,  you know what,  I'll write that idea down  on page 487  of my book here.  You're still trying  to page it.  89,  80,  80.  Opie's the bad boy 
[01:26:00]  of page turning 83,  84.  we have all these  other ideas to get to,  but we'll get to yours.  Hold on.  I'm almost at the...  All right,  I'll pencil you in  right here.  All right,  Greg.  Okay.  Check out my brother's  restaurant.  You know,  it's right there  in Huntington.  Yeah.  Which one?  I mean,  name it,  so,  you know,  maybe some other  people can come  in too besides me.  FH Riley's, 
[01:26:30]  400 New York Avenue.  Okay.  I'll be there  all weekend long.  You're all...  This weekend,  we bring T-shirts.  Okay.  All right,  Greg,  thanks.  Anytime,  Opie.  We'll be in touch.  You call anytime.  You got it,  Opie.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Pretty amazing.  You've been stalking me  since BAB.  I remember the voice.  Really?  Yep.  Holy shit,  I'm sweating.  Ooh.  Did it just get  really hot in here?  Yep.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  I was only saying that  because you took  your thing off.  I'm dead serious.  No.  I mean,  they got to figure out  the... 
[01:27:00]  It goes from AC  to a sauna.  You're sweating.  Well,  I have this,  you know...  Yeah.  Heavy fleece on.  All right,  we should take a break.  We'll regroup.  Uh-huh.  On the way,  Anthony.  The bad boy of what?  Well,  the Daily News today.  Uh-huh.  This week's  gay music.  Ooh.  I think we just  announced it as the  top songs that  Johnny Weir liked.  It's the top ten  gay songs of the week. 
[01:27:30]  I am not kidding.  Is it Johnny Weir?  It's his name.  Johnny Weir.  Johnny Weir.  Brett Weir.  What do you guys say  we go to break  and then see who's  the bad boy  of shoulder massage?  I want to be  the next American Idol. 
[01:28:00]  You are.  really  I don't know how far you'd get  why  I don't know  I don't think you're a singer  we got a guy with grey hair that made the finals  Michael McDonald  I like that guy a lot though man  yeah I don't think  there's something about his personality and his attitude that I like  well he made it through last night  how old is he? I've seen that guy  he's just premature grey I guess  he's probably in his mid-twenties I'm thinking 
[01:28:30]  but he could sing the blues  man  he came in with that harmonica last night  I like the guy I know he's not going to win  because it's just not what they're looking for  but I think he'll go pretty far before  he's got personality  that dweeby kid from Long Island  not even a chance  not at all  the poindexter looking kid  you know what you can  when they picked everybody at the end of the show  they all announced their names  and they do a little dance in front of the camera for a while 
[01:29:00]  yeah  white people  it is so bad  to watch the white guys trying to dance  horrid  by the way  they can't do it  I want to be two for two  if you remember last year  very early on  before the thing really started getting going  I said Carrie Underwood would win  I could spot this stuff  and I said this  you know  about a week or so ago  because now  she's in the finals  that little  Paris chick  that's like 16  guarantee  she's going to win the whole thing  I don't think so  I just want to go on the record 
[01:29:30]  and say it now  I don't think so  and then we'll play this tape back  in what  a month or so  I don't think she's good enough  I don't think she's good enough  who do you think  I think either  the guy  with the shaved head  really  yeah he's got a really good voice  yeah but he sounds like  he could be in any one of those  like  yeah I know  we'll see what happens  but there's another chick  I can't remember her name  that's really good  yeah the blonde is really good  yeah  she'll go far  but I don't think they're going to get  someone that looks just like  you know Carrie Underwood  it's the same story as  Carrie Underwood 
[01:30:00]  yeah  girl from a small town  I just don't think  comes out of nowhere  I don't think Paris is good enough  she's not like  I don't know  what about the chick with the  the junk in the trunk  that fucking  she's got to go  oh my crap  that ass moves  differently than the rest of her body  she is a big blob  she is huge  not  the weird part is  she's like  that old skit on SNL  the wide family  whatever they were called  yeah  it's all ass  like the rest of her 
[01:30:30]  is almost in proportion to  you know what I mean  well her ass is not in proportion  to the rest of her body  I guess I should say  only black chicks  can be fat  on American Idol  you can't  they weed out  the fat white chicks  I don't mean like  the chunky ones  I mean the big fat ones  they get rid of them  pretty quickly  yeah  but you can be fat  and black  and then you're a diva  fat black girls are sassy  fat white chicks  are just depressing  and cranky  there's a difference  that's why they see it  yeah but the fat black chicks  can kind of 
[01:31:00]  you know  they do movies  they're movie stars  how many fat white girls  are movie stars  you don't want to go  I mean Queen Latifah  lost weight  but she's still a fatty  I mean in comparison  with Beyonce  you can watch that  alright  at least she's an attitude  yeah  fat white chicks  like alright  just shut up  and suck my dick  in the back seat  quiet  you fucking elephant  I hate you by the way  because I got hooked  on the stupid American Idol  yeah  it was the first time  by the way  I was always good  for a couple shows  where the goof factor  all the dumb singing  and stuff  but now I'm really like  yeah you get into it  now I'm really following it 
[01:31:30]  this year  you kind of fall into  the whole thing  for whatever reason  but we love crying  and I gotta play the clip  of the chick crying  last night  because we love clips  of people crying  losing it  and most people  are at home  feeling for the young person  the young lad  or woman  or the athlete  that's retiring  we think it's the funniest  thing on earth  hysterical  we gotta do a whole show  on people crying  can we start collecting  crying clips  get old sports  retirement announcements

[01:41:00]  for free  for free  that's what's going on  by the way Scott  yeah  cause I guess he  he's bringing up that  we're driving people  so it's like  yeah yeah  this is great  people listening  come on subscribe  no it's not subscribers  they're listening for free  for free  that's 700 subscriptions  that aren't being made  to Sirius  no one is buying  that fucking horse  trailer sized unit  to listen to your  dog shit show  that is 700 people  with XM subscriptions  fucking with you  listening to your program  commenting on  how much it sucks 
[01:41:30]  and how they  couldn't listen to it  if it wasn't so much  fun to fuck with you  it's the whole  interactive thing  that makes it fun  yep  so uh  yeah  I don't think  you have to worry  about them  um  I don't think  we have to worry  about any of our  listeners going  wow this is great radio  you know  we're not stupid  we wouldn't send over  our listeners  to people we thought  were better than us  and did a great show  that would be really  dumb on our part  wouldn't it  yeah  hey listen to this guy  hey they're really good  fuck ONA  gee that backfired  that isn't gonna happen 
[01:42:00]  you know that a lot  of radio guys make  that exact mistake  yes they do  exact mistake  but there is no fear  uh in that happening  here because you stink  and uh  not only do you stink  but you've  you've melted down  the the pests  have gotten to this guy  so badly  that he can't  even do  the show  he wants to do  uh  he gets on  he starts rambling  about shit  which I guess  is his show  that's what he does 
[01:42:30]  uh he's got a hole  with him now  a hole of course  the woman  that keeps everything  under control  oh now  that's it boy  I'm glad  I bet  I bet you love  signing up with  Sirius there  they saddled you  with a hole  that's wonderful  to calm your ass down  and it's working  so well  wait wait wait wait wait  oh now  a hole in a dump button  yeah  and the pests  uh  have just stepped up  man  like I said  you know you're right  yeah  over 700 of these guys 
[01:43:00]  non-stop on the phones  you guys have to stop  oh no they won't  no  no  it's not funny  Pharrell  is incapable  of carrying on  stop it  a coherent conversation  because he's a self-centered  guys  I can't take this  I  yeah  I gotta say  you gotta stop  now  no we're not gonna stop  he's a self-centered ass  uh  who really has  some kind of  attention deficit disorder  I don't know what it is  but he can't  he cannot  speak  about a subject 
[01:43:30]  long enough  for anyone to even  give a shit  what he's saying  uh  he can't  pump out enough  facts about anything  he can't make it  interesting  so what he does is  takes a lot of calls  and babbles  quickly  with a caller  and I guess  that's  fooled people  over the years  that it was good radio  you the man  how can I be the man  when you the man  right  oh  we're both the man  are we  yeah  but he says it fast  nah  but it's kind of cool though 
[01:44:00]  that that's like  the whole like  I'm the man  but I want to be the man  yeah  but no you the man  how can I be the man  when you the man  you know  and then  someone will call up  and go like  uh  that's funny  someone will go  uh  hey uh  Pharrell  how you doing man  um  I was hanging out  drinking at some bar  last night  and I picked up this chick  and I banged  let me tell you  something about  picking up chicks  and banging them  I was at the bar  the other night  drinking a little Jameson  and uh  boy I picked up this chick  and let me tell you  she was so fucking hot  and sexy  I was just banging this bro  and then a friend came over  and I started fucking her too  and said 
[01:44:30]  ugh  what  I'm talking to those guys  they're a bunch of fams  those guys are a bunch of fams  no you didn't  is that what you did stupid  or was it  you cleaned out diapers  and got nagged at  Mr. Mom  that's what you did  right  you fucking took the baby formula  out of the fridge  heated it up  shoved it in your baby's face  and got nagged at by your wife  hey  that's what you did last night  you got any baby wipes  there's shit all over the rug  is that what you did  rock and roll  eh  clean it up  clean it up  clean it up  clean it up  what happened to shake it up  so the pest 
[01:45:00]  just jumped on it  it's really their show  at this point  of course it is  it is  here's what's serious  and that's what I was trying  to explain earlier  it's not about  just this four hour  bit of time  we do every day  the Yopi and Anthony  experience is now  24 hours a day  24 hours a day  it's a lifestyle man  and here's now  what's serious  is paying Pharrell to do  here's what Howard  has signed Pharrell on  I don't even know  if he's signed on  this seems like  kind of an audition  phase  I'm sure Howard Stern  is very happy 
[01:45:30]  I'm sure he's loving this  that one of his channels  has been taken over  taken over  by the Pest  Anthony fans  this is now  a three hour commercial  for the Yopi and Anthony show  on Sirius Satellite Radio  it is the Pests show  you know how Howard  is scrambling  to try to find  any programming  to fill his channels  and he can't do it  we on the other hand  like to get our  peripheral players  the Pests  but not tie up 
[01:46:00]  our channel with them  that's right  so we'll tie up  Howard's channels  with them  that's right  they are now  they have their own show  the Pests  ONA Pests  on Sirius Satellite Radio  and Scott  that's why they're not  going to go away  they realize it's now  their show  from 8 to 11pm  they have taken  they have completely  taken over your show  and don't think  they're just going to go away  they won't go away  they feed off  they're attention whores  they're attention whores  they feed off of this shit  they enjoy it  they love the recognition  that they get  they love being able  to get on 
[01:46:30]  and rag you  they love abusing people  they're fucking  that's  Pests  the name is Pests  that's the difference  that's the difference  it's a little weird virus thing  and now it's taken over  your channel  now Pharrell is incapable  of doing a show  without taking a lot of callers  he can't carry on  a conversation  he's got the hole in there  but they're from  two different fucking worlds  whenever they try to  converse with each other  it's embarrassing  to listen to  you can't fucking  listen to it  because he can't talk  to anyone  he's too self-centered  he can talk to callers  because he's got 
[01:47:00]  what he thinks  is complete control  how can I be the man  when you're the man  how can I be the man  when you're the man  I'm the man  no how can I be the man  when you're the man  so they've taken  that never gets old  the callers  out of the mix  they set them up  and then they punch  him right in the face  how many  Opie and Anthony  callers got through  a couple days ago  alright  last night  well I want to know  if last night  set the record  two nights ago  it was I think  48  about 48  last night  was 57 pests  got through  a total  of two 
[01:47:30]  supposedly  legitimate  callers  got through  and they were  obviously  and don't even  fucking  try to deny this  set up calls  it was a couple  of friends of his  he knew their name  they were from  Florida  he's like  me and Bobby  used to hang out  there  whatever  dude  we used to  drink in that  place  let me tell you  about a time  I was drinking  so much  Jameson  I couldn't  even see  he had to  carry me  out of the  joint  I'm such  a party  animal  you were  crazy  yeah  that's me  shut up 
[01:48:00]  you're the man  yeah  I'm the man  cleaning the  diapers  getting bitched  up by the  wife  you're a  hack  and the  pests now  own your  fucking show  is it true  they went to  like a 20  minute interview  or something  take the interview  here's what  happened  the pests  got on  guys you're  getting really  close to  blowing up  this guy's  gig  they said  the only line  they want him  on is the  unemployment line  I mean  they are  dead set  on getting  this guy  off that  fucking show 
[01:48:30]  making him  lose his  gig  that's what  the pests  want to do  and they  completely  have the  power to  do it  it is  amazing  the shit  I watched  I was  howling  I was  howling  watching what  was going  on last  night  they get  on and  it's  something  some of  the calls  are just  these very  obscure  show references  that skate  right by  and the other  ones are just  the blatant  punch in the  face  not you  fuck you  your whole  have your  whole show  her twat 
[01:49:00]  ONA party  rock  you stink  like in  your face  and other  ones are just  like  hey  Pharrell  I was  watching  the hockey  last night  and I gotta  tell you  they got a  player there  Frederica  Bimmel  she is  amazing  you guys  did ask  for that  reference  oh the  Frederica  Bimmel  calls were  hysterical  everyone that  came on  Chester references  everything  just really  funny  and the names  you could tell  were just  you know  hey it's  Jimmy  Jimmy  and then  another  Steve from 
[01:49:30]  Yellowstone  got through  this idiot  put a Steve  from Yellowstone  that's what  a disconnected  jack off  he is  how do you  not recognize  the name  Steve from  Yellowstone  Steve from  Yellowstone  dope  because he's  a self-centered  idiot who  thinks he's  going to be  able to  win over  the pest  and it  just ain't  going to  happen  here's what  his whole  show is  it's  dump  to not  be able  to just  deal with  it  to dump  like what  pussy  you have  to be  to dump  on satellite  that's the  bosses  telling them  yep  so here's  the format 
[01:50:00]  of what  happened  on his  show  it starts  off  planted  collar  right away  with some  ass kissing  on his part  then the  pest got  through  pound pound  pound pound  pound  wouldn't stop  and every time  he had to  build up more  delay  he would  play some  music  and just  babble  over it  incoherent  babble  like sing  those awful  lyrics  yeah  would that  make no  sense  it's just  about him 
[01:50:30]  or how  crazy  he is  and suck  a dick  suck a dick  he'll be like  suck a dick  suck a dick  suck a dick  suck a dick  suck a dick  suck a dick  80 times  over some  music  just to build  a leg  I like to  drink  I like to  drink  I go to  the bank  I go to  the bank  that's great  radio  for  boy you're  doing a great  fucking job  then the pests  again would  just pound him  and at one point  they went to  some taped  interview  with the hole  and some  Olympic person  over there  from I think  Bush was over  there at  Torino 
[01:51:00]  and they talked  with him  and that went  on for quite  a while  and then Pharrell  comes back  and it just  started again  bam  bam  bam  dude they  wouldn't  leave him  alone  and it wasn't  like you had  to sit there  and wait  for a pest  call  every call  that came  in was like  hey Pharrell  I just want  to tell you  I love  your show  man  it's fantastic  and you're  sitting there  going  I know  this is a  pest  I know  it  well thank  you baby  not you  and here's  the end game  to the pests 
[01:51:30]  out there  this guy  cannot do  a radio show  without using  the phone  no he can't  he can't  he can't  figure out  a way  to get  around this  it's not  like  somebody  who  even stupid  what's his  name  Phillips  from the  Phillips file  yeah  remember he  he did  something where  he stopped  taking calls  his show  stunk  he would  talk about  things that  no one gave  a shit  about  but he  actually was  able to  do a show  lousy one  but he didn't  have to take  callers for a  while  and that in  itself is an  admission of  defeat  because you've 
[01:52:00]  changed your  show  you changed  your show  because of  these psychopaths  Pharrell can't  do it  he's incapable  he has to  take calls  you guys own  the show  you own the  phones  you own the  show  it's the  pest's  fucking  show  and  Howard  believe me  is livid  about this  let's go to  Rob in  Jersey  Rob  hey boy  hey Rob  I have a  quick question  for you  back when you  guys were all  at NW  and you guys  were all one  big happy  infinity family 
[01:52:30]  wasn't Pharrell  competing with  Stern  yes  Pharrell and  Bob the Love  Sponge and the  rest of them  they all used  to fight the  same fight  we continue  to fight  but they knew  they didn't  have what it  takes to  compete  so now  they gotta  kiss Howard's  ass  that is a  fact  Bob the Love  Sponge and  Pharrell and  the rest of  them  they can try  to spin it  another way  but they used  to fight  this fight  the same  fight  we continue  to fight  unbelievable  because what  you said  is true  your friends  become your 
[01:53:00]  enemies  your enemies  become your  friends  at one point  didn't Pharrell  start to build  a little bit  of an audience  before he got  fired  didn't Stern  start giving  him shit  he was  definitely  starting to  build an audience  yes  unbelievable  but now his  life is going  to be a living  hell because  he just did  the wrong  thing as far  as we're  concerned  he tried to  land with a  big splash  and he wanted  to be a buzz  in the hallway  he wanted  everybody over  there to go  wow this  guy's a  maverick  you're not  a maverick  stupid  you're just  a disloyal 
[01:53:30]  jerk off  yep  yeah this is  what it comes  down to  because you  know he's  trying to  confuse the  issue  he could have  went over  there  obviously  we're not  trying to  prevent people  from working  Jim Brewer  was a huge  friend of ours  and he just  decided he had  a better opportunity  over there  he went over there  he's doing his  show  and he's leaving  us alone  he's not attacking  us or anything  like that  you don't have  to bash us  if you work  there and we  don't have to  bash you  if you work  over there  especially if you  call yourself  a friend of ours  and then there was  some stuff on his  website where he's  just trashing us 
[01:54:00]  saying Howard's  going to kick  our ass  and that got  under our skin  obviously  we're not  going to  pretend that  doesn't get  under our skin  and then he  goes on Howard's  show and just  decides to  trash us  it's like  what are you  doing  what are you  doing  if you can't  be funny  without  he's not a  funny guy  and so he  probably is  afraid of  bombing on  that show  so he  figured  this is how  I'll gain  acceptance  I'll trash  these guys  who are  friends  and that's  the issue  by the way  right there  he could have  went there  did his show  and just  moved on 
[01:54:30]  with his  career  without going  after us  and I think  we would have  been alright  here's another  interesting little  side note  about last  night  at one  point  Pharrell's  feed cut  out  and they  went to  a replay  of Howard's  show  I mean  the pests  were just  pounding so  badly  that they  actually  I think  cut his  feed  and just  started  replaying  an episode  of Howard's  show  and during  that time  I heard  Howard talking  about  how a lot  of his  listeners 
[01:55:00]  are calling  him and  writing him  and saying  that they  want  more  Howard  they want  they're  paying  you know  they bought  the series  for Howard  they want  more  Howard  so Howard  is considering  replaying his  show  in afternoon  drive  where Bubba  is right now  how long did you  think this would  take  I thought it was  going to be a  little longer  Bubba  just a little  longer  hey Bubba  still happy  Bubba happy  over there  happy over there  anchoring the  afternoons for the  fucking month  that it lasted  because let me 
[01:55:30]  tell you  something  you work  for Howard  fucking  Stern  when Howard  wants something  and he's in  charge  he gets it  he wants  your shift  you're going  to be moved  to the shittiest  slot in radio  mid days  mid days  mid days  you still happy  Howard in the  morning and Bubba  in the afternoons  for a month  he's going to  fucking replay  his show  in afternoons  he was talking  about it  and he's going  he goes 
[01:56:00]  you know  because a lot  of people drive  in they listen  to the show  or they miss  some of it  and they want  to listen  on the way  driving home  he goes  you know  but Bubba's  on in the  afternoons  I don't know  how he'd feel  maybe  would he be  pissed  if he did  mid days  like Howard's  thinking all  this out  on the air  how long  before his  fucking show  is an  afternoon  drive  you happy  Bubba  you feeling  that respect  that Howard's  giving you  as you kiss  his fucking  ass  he's giving  you no respect  you know  what he's  going to give  you mid days  have fun  with it  bye bye  and if you  were doing  so well  in afternoons  he wouldn't 
[01:56:30]  want to move  you  you're fucking  done  he's moving  you  it's all  about Howard  it's not  about Bubba  it's not  about fucking  Pharrell  they're just  people that are  trying to fill  time on two  channels  48 hours  of programming  in a 24 hour  period Howard's  got to fill  that's what he's  got to fill  and he's got Bubba  and Pharrell  doing it right now  and shows  about his show  here's something  I found out  do you know  that Howard's  show runs  after Howard's  show  boy Gary  and another guy 
[01:57:00]  do a show  about the show  you just heard  they sit down  well  and talk about  the show  you just heard  well this is  what we do  now  we're gonna  do a show  yeah  and then  we're gonna  have a show  about the show  we just did  and then  we're gonna  trump them  and have a show  about the show  that was about  the show  that we just did  because that show  I don't think  the show  about the show  would be interesting  but the show  about the show  about the show  now you're talking  interesting  and then guys 
[01:57:30]  I wanted to pitch  this all year  but I want to do  a show about  what I think  tomorrow's show  is gonna be about  no one's doing  a show before the show  what do you mean  what do you mean  Gordon's foreshadowing  the show  before the show  I've gotta be the man  when you're the man  this is the innovative radio  this is the  this is scrambling  for programming  that just isn't  available out there  hey  alright  everyone is very anxious  they're telling us  to shut up  and get to the  really funny  phone call  oh fuck yourself 
[01:58:00]  what are you gonna do  prank call us  psycho Brett  what's up  don't forget about  the end of the night  when we did  nothing but the  silent treatment  oh yeah  that was another one  oh yeah  I was the last  final call  and all you hear  him go  hello  hello  anybody there  okay later  douchebag  they played this  silent game with him  it was just  every call  they would call up  and he'd be like  hey around  and Pharrell calls it  like his speed round  thing  it's the last  ten minutes of his show  is nothing but  plunking phone lines down 
[01:58:30]  and trying to do  this stream of consciousness  with his caller  man  like a caller  would go  something like  hey Pharrell  what about the  hockey  what about the  American hockey team  let me tell you  what those guys  are  and then boom  another caller  and he tries to do that  and they completely  destroyed it  because he'd be like  you're on the air  hello  hello  you wanna  alright  you're not on the air  next caller  you're on the air  with Pharrell  hey hey  shake it up  shake it up  hello  hello  he turned into  Krusty  ugh 
[01:59:00]  fucking pests  alright  it was so funny  I gotta finally acknowledge  the ONA pass  are brilliant  they are  that's brilliant  dude  they are so organized  right now  and this isn't just  yelling out  to your  you know  the fake  typical radio  army  you know  that hey  if you send in  a self-addressed  stamped envelope  we'll send you  your army patch  these guys  are organized 
[01:59:30]  they have places  that they meet  and  they're using  the internet  they're using  all kinds of  telephone technology  to get through  and they are  busting up  this guy  they own  his fucking show  they own a show  on Sirius Satellite Radio  Doug  what's up  gentlemen  how does it feel  to have your own  radio show  it is fabulous  guys  it is absolutely  wonderful  not just you  I don't want to  like you know  but you guys  have your own  radio show  Opie I don't know  if you've touched  the pal talk  yet I haven't heard  you talk much  about it  I'm thinking about 
[02:00:00]  getting this pal talk  I hear it's pretty cool  Anthony was there  last night  and he can attest  to the fact that  when he goes off  on his  the fucking  cornholio  meltdown  whatever he does  to build up  his dump again  there is nothing  like watching  a hundred little  faces on your  screen smile  this little  fucking smile  is like  we're breaking  him  the 8 to 11  o'clock time  period is perfect  for this assault  it's after dinner  it's before you're  going out  it's while  shitty TV is on 
[02:00:30]  there is nothing  better for us  assholes to do  than to ruin  somebody's life  700  maniacs  just trying  to get through  yeah we had  700  that is  unbelievable  that is fantastic  that's like  scary numbers  every one of them  you look at their  cameras  you see phones  next to them  some people  you see two phones  you see a cell phone  yeah because you're  looking in on the  people making the  calls  so you're seeing  them working  their phones  working their  computers  but you're trying  to tell me  they're using  more than one  phone to get  through  oh dude  when I made 
[02:01:00]  him meltdown  yesterday when  you played that  audio when he  went fucking  ballistic in that  embarrassing tirade  about you guys  that was me  with the first  call and then  he did a little  I'm quick  you can't get  me  then he went  to me again  he picked up  he picked up  Doug twice  in a row  oh you know  I was wondering  about that  yesterday  because I'm  like why  is he still  on the line  he went to  another call  and it happened  to be you  on the other  line too  guys are using  dialing programs  on their computers  yeah  so they're  I mean  they're using  everything  they're organized 
[02:01:30]  they come up  with ideas  like like  because there are  sometimes you're  going to make  a prank call  or something  and you don't  have a good idea  there are 700  people suggesting  shit and all  of a sudden  bam  alright let's  all do this  that's why  the silent game  thing worked  everyone goes  alright just  don't say  anything  now you got  all the people  organized  doing the silent game  you know Doug  they're having  meetings every day  to try to figure  this out  and so far  you guys have  just won  there's no way  to stop  it's a slaughter  they're owned 
[02:02:00]  they're not happy  that they're getting  ONA references  on the air  and Opie and Anthony  references on the air  they wouldn't like it  on one of their  oldies channels  never mind  fucking Howard's  channel  and believe me  they know he  started this  they know he  opened his big  mouth and they  know he brought  this out himself  they're not stupid  you guys gotta  understand too  you guys keep  explaining the  whole reasoning  behind it  now the pests  love you guys  and we love the  show  we don't care  about the reasons  we're just happy  we're fucking  ruining someone's  there's the 
[02:02:30]  mentality people  there it is  and that's what  scares us  I love when they  because I love  when the critics  or the people  that are being  attacked say  oh they're a  bunch of puppets  for ONA  it's like no  believe me  I wish they  were  it's much  more frightening  than that  they just enjoy  fucking with people  you're listening  to the only radio  show where the  fans will eat  the host  eventually  yeah  we're actually  coming up with  a list of  demands right now  it's not going  to be another  be given  it's not going  to be another  show with their 
[02:03:00]  fans  it's going  to be our  own fans  that decide  one day  to just  eat us  they're not  going to show  up dressed  like a female  praying mantis  you're going  to fuck  them  and they're  going to  bite your  head off  and spit  it out  I think  we'll have  it on  Friday  but it's  nothing really  big  something like  re-talk  about the  pest radio  maybe some  color units  for some of  us  GM cars  for the  generals  shit like  that  there you go  nothing really  big  Doug  yo  keep your eye  on the prize  yes  alright  Mikey  Gaga  is banned  by the way  well he wrote  an email  and says 
[02:03:30]  I can't face  the truth  that we did  the same  thing  to Ron  and Fez  I'm sorry  did we hire  Ron and Fez  and they were  doing afternoon  drive  and then we  kicked them  to middays  is that what  happened  no  see  no  or did they  come on board  and do middays  because that's the way  it is  and that's the way  it worked out  here  let me explain  something about  Ron and Fez  we love Ron  with our show  they're unbelievable  their show  is great  and yes  they're in middays  right now  and yes 
[02:04:00]  a lot of the fans  are frustrated by that  but there's  there's a much  bigger picture  that's happening here  right  and that was  supposed to be  put in place  already  but something  happened  so it's  it's delayed  things are in the works  things are in the works  and Ron and Fez  knew that going into this  and they also have  part of morning drive  on the west coast  yeah  it's like we're  splitting morning drive  and we didn't  tell them that they  were in afternoon drive  put them there  and then boot them out  like how he is  going to do with Bubba  it's different  trust me  we can't play our hand  right now

[02:16:30]  we've worked  for the same  company as the  guy we know  how he can  fuck up a  fun happy  situation  we came into  new york  went to  infinity broadcasting  we were having  fun  and uh  it was  it was  great to  work for  such a  name company  until we  got on  how he's  radar  and then  it becomes  a fucking  chore  and that  is what's  happening  over there  the guy's  a control  freak  he's an  asshole  he's a  two-faced  motherfucker  and uh 
[02:17:00]  any of the  guys he's  got working  for him  bubba  pharrell  are in  the end  going to  realize  uh  that they've  been fucked  by this  guy  it's  already  happening  his ego  gets in  the way  and it's  really sad  the guy  howard stern  cannot  take a  joke  that's  how this  whole  dumb  war  with uh  with him  started  yeah  take a  joke  anthony  started goofing  on him  and uh  doing the  howard stern  voice  and he  couldn't  handle it  and it was  just funny  radio  there was 
[02:17:30]  nothing  vicious  about it  no it  wasn't even  vicious  it was  just  about  it was  about  like  taking  the  howey copter  out to  the  hamptons  things like  that  it wasn't  anything  personal  or vicious  or anything  and then he  just lost  his mind  ran to  Mel  you know  the rest  what he  should have  done  back then  is embraced  you guys  and said  look these  guys are  funny  we're in  the same  company  and fucking  pointed out  that you  guys were  funny  you know  what I mean  you don't  get mad at  somebody for  pointing out  that you're  funny  there's  just no  reason  before  someone  really  fucks  us  before we  really get  fucked  when it's  just  teetering 
[02:18:00]  with a  phone call  we're pretty  much  softies  or talk  to us  we're willing  to give  the benefit  of the doubt  as long as  we haven't  just been  laid down  and fucked  in the ass  you know  there's a few  people that  did that  we just  had  Cowhead  right  was accused  of  maybe  absconding  with one  of our  bits  the mousetrap  bit  and he  called up  and was  like  dude  explain the  whole thing  and it's 
[02:18:30]  fine  we have  no problem  with Cowhead  he handled  that perfectly  by the way  Pharrell  goes over  there and  bad mouths  us  and bashes  us  this is  what he's  going to  know  it's  too late  and it's  not going  to stop  Lauren  to answer  your question  by the way  we do have  a dump  button  here  we hit  it once  to save  ourselves  from slander  that was  it  to save  ourselves  from a  million dollar  lawsuit  that was  the only  time we  hit it  stupid  bill  said that  he had  a teacher  that  fucking  was  dealing  drugs 
[02:19:00]  or something  and gave  the guy's  name out  that's when  the dump  button  should be  used  where is  the dump  button  who has  it  I got  one right  there  it's this  thing  here  this thing  with a lot  of dust  on it  yeah  it's next  to the  alert  I don't know  what the  alert button  what is  alert  let me push  it  hold on  should I  push it  no no no  it says  alert  should I  push it  no no  why don't we  find out  what it is  first  what is  it  it turned  red when I  pushed it  I don't know  what it does 
[02:19:30]  what did it  do  is the light  going off  in like  you Panera's  office right  now  what does  it do  and this  one's  talk  does this  talk to  you guys  hey  Derek  you fucking  cunt  how you doing  asshole  I heard all  that  alright  so to the  listeners  then there's  the cough  button  this is if I  have to cough  you won't hear  me  so you hear  me  la la la  la la  Jimmy  that's you  coughing  but I don't  have a cough  button  and then the  dump button  the cough  button is the  stupidest  invention  radio  yeah  let me  let me tell 
[02:20:00]  you people  we're back  and the  time is  time and  temperature  where are you  going to be  I got quite  a cold  I never  understood that  because I  learned  the pros  aren't supposed  to cough  on the  I learned  my radio  from brother  wheeze  and he  taught me  the best  lesson ever  it was just  like just  try to be  yourself on  the radio  and let it  all just  fly  so if you  have to  cough  fart  belch  Jimmy has a  bloody ass  fart button  which really  disturbs me  but the  professional  broadcaster  is they need  to make sure  the coughs  don't make  the air  and stuff  so there's  a cough 
[02:20:30]  button  cough  but Lauren  they're in  deep trouble  over there  with censorship  and all sorts  of things  because they  didn't figure  out this  whole satellite  radio thing  so they got  very long  delays  they're having  meetings behind  the scenes  they've already  started censoring  Howard  he'll start  talking about  that soon  I guarantee  it  yep  and there's  other things  they didn't  do technically  that's really  going to screw  them in the end  so that's why  you're hearing  all these  dumps and stuff  they're on a  very very long  delay to protect  their asses  well I'm not  hearing it 
[02:21:00]  because I don't  listen so  I don't really  give a shit  and then you got  the Howard  ego thing  you know  yeah I could  care less  just keep on  doing what you  guys are doing  and we love you  thank you  we gotta get to  more of these  calls  I mean enough  let's get back  to the funny  I'm Mike  I'm Mike in Jersey  hello  hey Mike  no buddy  what's happening  not much  party rock  dude  okay  party rock  dude  party rock  what's a party  rock  just some  chick with a  Frederica in a  fast smelly box  hey party rock  party rock  check this out  hey party rock

[02:22:00]  I think he did  just when he  thinks he has  a real caller  the guy  first of all  you can tell  he was  he was so  scared at the  beginning of that  call that it  was gonna be a  pest that he  just was talking  over him  and trying to  head him off  at the past  by throwing out  pest lingo  and stuff  and then he  finally the guy  just like  hello  what  you know  you're being  an asshole  are we done  can I get  my point  across  and then  Pharrell's like  okay  Ramone  genius call  by the way  genius  you held off  that dope  trying to use

[02:23:30]  he's doing that  just off the top  of his head  that's all pre-recorded  can we have that  can that be slowed down  and have  can we get a transcript  of what he actually said  and just say  read it like a transcript  instead of in the  big pass language  and just read it  as if it's a  written spoken word  I'm going to give that  job to Travis  yes  Travis  and then Travis  is going to come in here  and recite what Pharrell said  a little air time  for Travis today  that's right  alright  so Travis will take  that whole rant  that we just heard  and he'll transcribe it

[02:31:30]  they listened to a joke  and  the object was  to tell a joke  funny enough  to have them spit water  in their hole's face  yeah  cause they got a hole over there  yeah  of course they do  yeah  this is what you get for free  by the way  that's the  that's the ones  that fucked over  Christina  Nagy  who had been there  for a long time  yeah  and they dumped her  for somebody younger  and she got a good gig  at Light  but I like her  it kind of sucked  she's very cool  actually  yeah she's really nice  she's a very very cool chick  in radio  ah  alright  well here's  doing your Kashi  mhm

[02:32:30]  what is it  deer nuts  are $1.25  and deer nuts  are under a buck  oh my  I got douche chills  I'm embarrassed  I'm embarrassed  why because I open  with that joke  oh my god  no she's got the water  in her mouth  yeah she has the water  in her mouth  of course  because it would be funny  to have a woman's face  spit in so they won't do that  right  she's got the water  in her mouth  I thought that was  a little like  not like them  right  like when the guy 
[02:33:00]  described it  to have the two guys  spit water in her  in the hole's face  because that was  kind of annoying me  that it was  kind of funny  so it sounds like  she just kind of  blew some dude  right  trying to figure out  what she's going to do  with this  yeah right  and deer nuts  what's the difference  between  well she doesn't know  what  what is it  deer nuts  are $1.25  and deer nuts  are under a buck  oh  oh  oh  this is good

[02:34:00]  and that's a take  on the old  Ron and Fez bit  that we played  you have no sense  of humor  that's a take off  on the old  Ron and Fez bit  well that's a little  more serious  that's the way to play it  that's the way to play it  right  you get some  fat dude  in a kiddie pool  and he's completely naked  and he's filled up  with water  from an enema  an enema  up his  yeah of course  up his ass  you fill him up  with water  and you tell him  jokes  in round robin  fashion  until he just 
[02:34:30]  blows  shit out  his hands  that's how you  play that  oh I have a  well I guess  that's how  and you know  what Ron and Fez  did that on  free radio  too  yeah  yeah that was  free radio  wow  back in the day  fucking lunatics  I wonder we all  ended up without  jobs  yeah  hey Fez  he's gonna shit  all over  alright Ronnie  hey watch out  for the shit  there Fez  hey buddy  don't shit  in the pool  and they blame  us  they were one 
[02:35:00]  show away  from blowing  themselves up  yeah that was  a little much  let's be honest here  alright  hey um  we got some  Tom Likas audio  and then we gotta  get into the  gay music  this is fun  this is like  other radio  people  hour  well it's an  ongoing theme  with us  we hate guys  that use  fake voices  to do radio  when I was in  LA  and I was  hanging with  this gal  we would listen  to Tom Likas  wasn't it the girl  from the beach  that you liked  that ignored you 
[02:35:30]  and kind of  were a little  heartbroken about it  well you know  just confirmation  number 151  that I'm ugly  I don't want to  bring it up  but  no no no  I just  well I remember  we would play  the Tom Likas  and she couldn't  get over how much  I hated him  and then she  started to laugh  every time he  talked  she's like  he really does  do that  she couldn't  get over that  a guy is that  phony  yeah the fake  1-800 Tom  and I remembered  because I'm always  thinking show prep  that I had seen  on Penn & Teller's  Bullshit  a show about  family values  I think  Tom Likas 
[02:36:00]  was a guest  hold on hold on  hold on hold on  you brought a bit  to the show  oh I brought  many bits  to the show  wow  the whole bit  about Kashi  cereal  remember that one  that was a bit  that we wish  we had back  but I was  watching Penn & Teller's  Bullshit  hairdo  and they showed  that hairdo  it was more  than a bit  nutty gym  you really brought  this to the show  well Hawk brought  it but I couldn't  find it  I have the CD  thing and I said  no I mean you  you did show prep 
[02:36:30]  for this radio show  oh yeah  I do it every day  you don't understand  I'm all about show  when I'm home  live show  I live show  do you live show  they call me show  Jimmy  you live this radio  program  yeah I mean it's  oh nutty gym  sorry it just comes  out when I get  defensive  did you think of  any bits as you  were getting the  knuckle up your  ass last night  yeah was the show  on your mind then  you bet it was  because sometimes  I go to the gym  and I'm on a  treadmill or something 
[02:37:00]  and the ideas  just start flowing  so I'm assuming  when you're getting  massaged and a  finger up your ass  knuckle deep  you get some ideas  for the show  to close your eyes  and here's the bit  I'm on a massage  table and all of you  are behind me with  gloves and I have to  guess whose knuckle  it is by the jewelry  you have on your finger  Steve is easy  yes it is because  he's got big rings  big thick finger  and I feel his heart  on against my feet  yeah  anyway 
[02:37:30]  he rock you'd smell  bacon  and um  so I heard  this audio  and I heard Tom  like his talk  regular  and then I heard  they showed a clip  of him standing there  he's just such a  fat cunt  he stands there  like  like just this  this fuck  this genius  can't be contained  standing there  talking like a  stiff fatso  with sunglasses  sunglasses  in a studio  yeah  this is gonna be  uh  to no surprise 
[02:38:00]  to anyone  but um  we had our  run-ins with  Tom  he's a douche  like I said it  before  radio  and professional  wrestling  are the only  two occupations  where people  act like this  for some reason  we still have  a list of people  we never touched  yeah I know  you know  but it does  look ugly at times  you never  you know  at any moment  any of those  people we never  touched  can slam a chair  into our face  and throw us  over the ropes  right  it's just the way  this business is  hey I need  to get a cheap 
[02:38:30]  plug in  John in Northport  John  hey what's up  what's up John  I was at FH Raleigh's  the other night  it was top notch  my brother's restaurant  top notch  top notch  top notch  dinner  did you like the food  yeah it was great  yeah the food  is getting rave reviews  at FH Raleigh's  yeah  a lot of people  writing about it  on the websites  the magician they have  he was out of control  the what  the magician  oh you saw  Fast Daddy  Fast Daddy  yeah  he is blowing up 
[02:39:00]  he's so excited  that we're talking  about him on the radio show  Fast Daddy  is my sister's  father-in-law  and he walks around  on Friday and Saturday  nights and does  tricks in like  talks  yeah  he was unbelievable  he used to book  Fast Daddy's comedy  it was a bar  you know him from  back in the day  me and Otto  used to go there  and do gigs  for Fast Daddy  he was like  one of the guys  that was really nice  to me early on  you know when he  owned that place  I probably hung out  with you and didn't  even know it  because I was there  all the time  especially when Otto  and George  performed at his  old club  I was there  every time  you absolutely saw me  because I was 
[02:39:30]  Otto's opening act  and one time  they made fan shirts  for me  it was the first time  I ever had any  kind of fan reaction  they brought t-shirts  I still have them  that said  we love you Norton  stenciled  and it had like  a stupid happy face  oh that's cool  with a crew cut  painted on it  yeah well now Fast Daddy  he had it with the club business  and now he does  magic on the side  and other things  and he helps us out  at FH Riley's  on the weekends  and then his son  is behind the bar  and my sister's  making the cheesecakes  it's a family affair  this is great  John thanks for the props 
[02:40:00]  yeah he's getting  great reviews so far  bunching out  it's 400 New York Avenue  in Huntington  I'll be there all weekend  and this weekend  we bring t-shirts  I want to bring a girl  there one night  to have a dinner  what little date  a date  you know what  I want to do  I want to get a field trip  together  we'll all go out there  during the week  but I want to bring a date  you need a girl  I shouldn't have cut  my new hairdo off  it would be easy  to get girls then  God you cut that  why  it was awful  it was lovely  they'd run their hands  under it and go  is that what they do 
[02:40:30]  pick up the frillophone  yuck  douchebag  last weekend  the gang from Pal Talk  all over the joint  I mean all over the joint  yep  was Lucci and her  large breasts there  oh are they heavy looking  I don't know all the names  like you guys  I just kind of recognized them  a few of them  they're on camera  Stingray was there  and a bunch of others  they had a good time  and they're going to  make it their hangout  from time to time  so thank you for that  alright so it's back 
[02:41:00]  to Penn and Teller  bullshit with Tom Likas  yeah just the phony  fucking radio  if you've never heard  you gotta play the audio  of him talking real first  real first  yeah I think so  this is Tom Likas  for some reason  and I don't get it  he's pretty big in LA  in LA radio  I don't get it  I'll tell you why  because this fucking  phony rebel  these dummies in LA  who listen to him  think that this guy  he's really taking the bull  by the horns  this is their idea  of what a rebel is 
[02:41:30]  because everything out there  because of show business  is very emasculated  so they think that this guy  fucking tells it like it is  Likas 101  yeah he's gonna tell you  about the how to handle women  yeah  yeah with a yule log  and a fireplace  we haven't told the story  in a while  where he actually  locked his studio  before he started  trashing us  that's how brave he is  he was on NAW with us  and you know  it has to be said  we were the big stars  at that station  I'm not trying to  do a power trip thing here  because people like to 
[02:42:00]  discuss that these days  but the fact is  we were doing very well  and had huge ratings  and they brought  other shows in  and Tom Likas  was such a cocky ass  from the west coast  he comes to New York  and immediately  just starts trashing us  for no reason  we never met the guy  or anything  and we were doing  unbelievably well  for the station  so it was like  why are you trashing us  this doesn't make sense  but whatever  so we're listening to him  well then we went at  then we trashed him back  I guess  yeah  so then he trashed us  and he thought we left 
[02:42:30]  he thought we left  the station  we were sitting  in our office  drinking  drinking  and listening to him  trash us  yeah  and he's right down  the hallway  so I look at Anthony  like that's it  and I get up  and I decide to  confront him  okay  we're just gonna rush  into the studio  and grab his mic  and start calling him  a fucking asshole  and I swear  I believe that he thought  we were already in our cars  back to Long Island  you know  but just in case  he had the studio locked  because he wasn't positive 
[02:43:00]  yeah  but he thought he was safe  to just give us a trashing  and nothing would happen  so all of a sudden  we're outside the door  and it's locked  and we just start screaming  through the door  we're banging on the door  where he could not  ignore us  yeah  it's like  open the door  you pussy  just pounding  as hard as we can  trying to do his show  and ignore it  and his producer  opens the door  and this is what we saw  a guy with a  down syndrome haircut  dark dark dark  shades on 
[02:43:30]  with the lights out  in the studio  with the lights out  dark shades  standing there  with a down syndrome haircut  and like a  two thousand dollar  suit on  to do a radio show  didn't he have a  members only jacket on  I don't know  I remember the suit  he is a horse's ass  yes  so we go in there  and we confront him  and he's like  ah let's get into this  let's go  and I just  I just let him have it  I blast him for a good  I don't know  maybe  I don't know anymore  maybe 30-40 seconds  and all of a sudden  he's like  that's it  that's it 
[02:44:00]  and he  he turns  our microphones off  yeah he wouldn't  even let us talk  of course he wouldn't  so then we start  you know  we go right back  to being in third grade  and we start calling him  a pussy  and a faggot  and all this stuff  yeah turn the mic on  as we left the studio  yelling  so  blah blah blah  so here's Tom Likas  and this is his real voice  I think so  yeah  they put in the right order  and here's another guy  with traditional family values  on the brain  he's Michael Medved  and he's the host  of a daily syndicated radio show 
[02:44:30]  that reaches millions of people  radio people always want  to get on TV  we encourage marriage  because it is  the best way  to raise children  okay  I'm sorry  it leads into  okay  I thought it was the wrong clip  okay  that was Tom Likas  no no no  he's  oh my god  you scared the shit out of me  I'm like  it can't be that bad  it's got to kind of sound  like how he sounds  on the radio  I'm thinking  kind of a lead in  I guess  we encourage marriage  because it is  the best way  to raise children  and it is essential 
[02:45:00]  for the survival  of our civilization  want another radio guy  okay  here's Tom Likas  and he thinks  well  a bit differently  you are paying  for use  of a vagina  I definitely think  family is bullshit  that was him  that's him  wow  that's him talking  normally  that's him talking  normally  are you kidding  that's him  and this is him  on the radio  obviously  I had a guy  call me yesterday  he has two kids  he's been living  with a woman  for eight years  and he's thinking  about getting married  why would he want 
[02:45:30]  to do that  Tom Likas  is against marriage  and he's  real subtle about it  he's not going  to get anything  by marrying her  that he doesn't  already have  sex  companionship  his kids are near him  why get married  Likas tells guys  not to get married  he must not be  listening to his own show  he's been married  four times  and been through  four divorces  to him  marriage is strictly  a financial arrangement  and a bad one  if you're a man  it is just like  forming a corporation  with some chick  who's a hot piece 
[02:46:00]  of ass  and now  she owns  50% of the corporation  and so do you  50%  yesterday you owned  100% of your corporation  and what happens  to these guys  when their corporation  goes belly up  you will take half  of everything you own  plus a check every month  and you're gonna mail it  to her  does that sound like  a good deal for a man  it's not  have you ever heard  a fucking  phonier sounding  cocksucker than that  I gotta agree  with the content though  oh yeah  god damn it 
[02:46:30]  he makes a good point  makes a valid point  in an awful voice  100%  and you're gonna  jack and send it  to her every month  how does anybody  listen to that  dog shit  here's the  real voice again  you guy  okay here's Tom  likest and he thinks  well a bit differently  you are paying  for use  of a vagina  I definitely think  family is bullshit  why not just  talk like that  Tom  and that's even  a little put on  you can tell that  that's his interview  voice  but 
[02:47:00]  just do your show  like that  you know marriage  there's a problem  it's a  50% partnership  with  but it's gotta be  over the top  high energy  in other words  phony  wow is he a  fucking fraud  if you think  that guy is  compelling  or really pushing  the envelope  you really are  a diluted  bucket of jism  eek  alright  oh there's  Ellen dancing  leave Ellen alone  she doesn't want  to dance anymore  I told you  I don't care  she also doesn't  want to take photos 
[02:47:30]  of the people  who work for XM  she tried to stop  why doesn't she  tell everybody  she doesn't want  to dance  she tried  look at her  dancing with it  but she's smiling  like she's enjoying it  stupid slacks  she looks like  she has a dick  through those pants  though  exactly  like she's wearing  slacks  like men's slacks  so you don't see  camel toe  you see a little bulge  she's still dancing  god I hate the fun  she's having  I'll bet you  they told her to stop  and then she wanted  to pipe back up  she's having way  too much fun  you know  no it's great  she's a shark too

[02:57:00]  an exhaust pipe  yeah  and go through  a window  well anyways  I appreciate you guys  and I've gotten  two verified calls  into Scott  so far this week  and I'm working  on more  oh thanks  Indy Mike  you guys take care  meanwhile  back at the show  and it's just  such corny  awful sentiment  yeah  you got nothing  I got nothing  I'm gonna tear  you up  are you  well  go ahead  who are you  who are you  talking to  you're contracted  serious  when they fucking 
[02:57:30]  tell you to keep  dumping out  and you're gonna  have to walk soon  oh my god  every night's just  gonna get worse  for him  what a cornball  have fun  we interrupt this  program to bring  you  the ozone  midget sighting  of the day  wow  guys  I saw a midget  stop it  wait a minute  hold it  this  hopey  when  where  uh  valentine's day  I was having  some fine breakfast  and I had  a window seat 
[02:58:00]  and a  I swear to god  and a bunch  of students  walked by  I don't know  if they were  going to the bus  coming from the bus  going on a field trip  but they were  all the same size  yeah  but you could tell  one was a midget  yeah the midget arms  and legs  absolutely a midget  but  here's the  Popeye arms  here's the interesting  thing  at that age  she's the same  height as everybody  else  yeah  so you gotta think  she's thinking  at that point  that  maybe I'm gonna  grow  but it's so obvious 
[02:58:30]  that she's a midget  already  everyone has their  growth spurt  and you just  stay that height  but they walked  on by  I'm like  I'm not seeing a midget  this is the first one  in a very long time  it looks like a bunch  of kids  and one skinless  butterball turkey  fucking worthless  meanwhile  back at the show  alright so we should  get to this  Tony Danza audio  yes  we teased this  yesterday I believe  big things  going on  Anthony brought this  to our attention  right  big things going on  in Danza's life  right now  has him a little 
[02:59:00]  stressed out I think  one is his job  it seems that  the people that  put on his  program  want him  fired  they have a  replacement show  all lined up  but they're afraid  to tell Tony  they know Tony Danza  well enough  that  they believe  he will leave  the program  if he's told  that his show  is being cancelled  and he's only got  a few weeks left  they don't have  a replacement  right now  already  so they don't want 
[02:59:30]  just dead air  in there  or have to  fill it with  something  so they haven't  told him  everyone else  knows  and everyone  else has told  him  so there's  all these rumors  going around  so he's very  stressed out  about that  and it is  apparent  during his show  that he knows  the jig's up  it's over  Johnny  that coupled  with the fact  that the post  I guess  did a little  story on page  six and had  pictures of his  daughter  kissing  other girls  and smoking  pot  from her 
[03:00:00]  MySpace  sight  and I guess  that's got him  a little  in it  but that's what  girls do  these days  they're all  kissing other girls  not if they're  your daughter  but they're all  kissing other girls  but if you're  a dad  how old is she  how old is the  daughter  three  yeah that could  shake him up  a little bit  I guess  is it a teen  daughter  yeah  smoking pot  there you go  that's Tony Danza's  daughter really  yeah 
[03:00:30]  and there she is  the one that  looks like  Tony Danza  that's one of  those fake  lesbian kisses  there's nothing  real going on  see the one  that looks like  Tony  hey how you  doing  I'm a chick  it looks like  Tony with glasses  tits and labia  tits and labia  yeah  thoughts and prayers  yeah but that's  like a fake  lesbian kiss  over there  daughter  number three  shot  that  yeah look  know why  because they're  reaching their lips  out like this  so there's not much  so there's not much  contact  yeah if they were  really into it 
[03:01:00]  their faces would  be smushed together  more  but I'm just saying  coupled with the  smoking pot there  is she in a bikini  there  can you almost  see camel toe  I want a nose  on cheek kiss  I need that picture  zoomed up and  in hand  stop the presses  a teenage girl  smoking pot  yeah  but it's  if it's your  daughter  that's different  you don't want  that  especially if  Tony Danz is  your father  you know he's  like old school  fucking  gavon  italian  zooming right 
[03:01:30]  in on that  twat  let's see  she got a little  meat on her  what do you mean  that's either a shadow  or it's a  or hair  is that a shadow  she's italian  those italian chicks  got some  got some hairy muffs  we know that's belly  but it gets dark  down there  gets very dark  a lot of italian girls  get that line of hair  from the belly button  all the way down  to ground zero  it's awful  isn't that something  it's like a mane  it's disgusting  shave all of it  you chimps  you chimps 
[03:02:00]  mamma mia  what the hell is that  with any hair down there  get rid of it  enough already  they look like  little girls  exactly  finally  do we need to  explain this to you  further  so his little girl  is uh  you know  in the spotlight  like that  and I don't think  he enjoys that  being the traditional  he tries to come off  like a traditional  old school  italian  dad  kind of thing  forgetting the days  of taxi  and the younger 
[03:02:30]  version of himself  he's turned into  an old man  he sings these  like torch songs  I don't know  what the fuck  they're called  but he ended  his show  the other day  the show  that I guess  we have tape of  where he sounds  drugged  and I'll get  into that  with some girl  sitting at a piano  and him singing  some awful  old  song  like it's  1950  on the  Dumont network  he's uh  he's singing  some old  tune  he sounds  like he's on  dope  what the show  is awful 
[03:03:00]  what  the Dumont  network  yeah that was  like uh  old  way old  before they even  had like  the regular  it was one of the  networks way back  in the old  old days  like groucho  would have been  on there  it was  DuPont  or Dumont  Dumont  the Dumont  network  I have old  kinescopes  of some of the  uh  your show of  shows  you know who  just mentioned  I think the  Dumont network  some comic  oh Modi  my friend Modi  is a comedian  was talking to me  about  he worked with  this guy  Jack Carter  he said there  were like  three shows 
[03:03:30]  on back then  it was  Milton Berle  it might have  been groucho  or somebody  and this guy  fucking  Jack Carter  who was telling  stories of how  he got like  Lucy started  and they were  doing that  I would love  to get him  I remember  who Jack Carter  is  I don't know  if he does  radio  but I'd love  to get him  on the show  alright  but Tony Danz  is a little  fucked up  about this  whole thing  and in my  opinion  I will protect  us here  in my opinion  knowing what  he looked like  seeing him  host his  program  and then  seeing him  host his  program  after this  news  knowing people  that have  been on  drugs 
[03:04:00]  he appeared  to me  like someone  who was on  some kind  of sedative  Anthony are you  saying that  without a doubt  Tony Danz  is on drugs  no I  absolutely  did not  say that  he could  be  but you  have no  idea  I have no  idea  no clue  this is based  on my own  opinions  of people  I have seen  under sedation  of some kind  he reminds you  of them  he reminds me  of them  alright  you wanna hear  some audio  do I  just listen  to this  and I wish  I could  translate  how he  looked  cause his 
[03:04:30]  eyes were  at half  masked  he was  very  like  stumbly  kinda  sedated  it looked  I know  how he  looked  the description  you're  looking for  is like  a douchebag  ok  that you  can say  ok  we gotta go  what else  we gotta do  here  we gotta so  much stuff  to do  I watched  a lot  of TV  last night  oh by the way  you know what  I made  last night  usually I made  broccoli  with garlic  and oil  last time  I made  it was  onions  and oil  pretty good  broccoli  dude  this is what  he is off  on a tear 
[03:05:00]  if you speed  this up  by the way  it sounds  like Pharrell  it's just  going off  on  I watch TV  I was doing  some cooking  I got some  garlic  but then I  decided to  put some  onions in  shake it  do you see  what he's doing  he's going  off  he's in  20 different  directions  I smell  bit  yeah  how do you  prepare your  broccoli  wow  the phone lines  are open  and I didn't  know  should I use  the onions  or the garlic  fantastic people 
[03:05:30]  thoughts and prayers  to the garlic  here we go  what a bum  by the way  you know  what I made  last time  I made  usually I made  broccoli with  garlic and oil  last time I made  it was onions  and oil  pretty good  broccoli with  onions  anyway  set off the  smoke alarm  again  skating with  celebrities was  funny last  night  because  if you went  to the Olympics  they had the  pair skating on  at the same  time  and did you  see that  Chinese couple  when the guy  throws her  it's like a  quad  so-cow  or so-cow 
[03:06:00]  or sal-cow  or whatever  she goes up  and she falls  down  and legs go  where  there's no way  they're supposed  to go that way  gets back up  and wins the  silver medal  unbelievable  there's a  dance of applause  break  and then  Bruce Jenner  oh forget  no I'm kidding  anyway  it was shock  I know  his olive oil  skin and  guinea charm  are not working  anymore  to watch this  it is so painful 
[03:06:30]  it is actually  it brings you  physical pain  to watch this  this just in  brand new  Howie Math  brand new  Howie Math  alright  this comes from  Danny  more Howie Math  says bosses  told him  he is responsible  for at least  2.5 million  subscribers  wait  don't they have  three  didn't they have 
[03:07:00]  over a million  when  but  but I  but  but  then  Major Healy  came over  but then I saw  a girl  was in the room  and  Major Nelson  I  but then  we love  Howie Math  Howie Math  it makes  yourself look  better  and  using the  Howie Math  formula  Anthony  and I  are responsible  now  for over  4 million  XM subscribers  4 million  subscribers  directly related  to this  program  they 
[03:07:30]  got  XM  because of  the Opie and  Anthony show  yes  they didn't get it  because of  anything else  but us  and that's how  he works it  over there  we were told  that by  a little fairy  came by  and just told us  I thought he worked  at Sirius now  I was told  by a gnome  a gnome  gnome  G-N-O-M-E  gnome  gnome  gnome  a fairy  might have told  you but a gnome  told me  unbelievable  who told you  Jimmy  Howie Math  a boy of  elfin qualities  in a tree 
[03:08:00]  alright here we go  more Danzo audio  so he just  mentions Bruce  Jenner  and that's  what makes good  TV  he just mentions  something  and then just  stop without  commenting about it  he will go  from subject  to subject  completely stopping  he'll try to  segue  from car tires  into cooking  and without  even thinking  twice about it  this next track  is called  Why Are They  Applauding  why are they  applauding  this must be  Fan 
[03:08:30]  that came up  with this  I know his  humor by now  why are they  applauding  and I probably  know the clip  I haven't heard  these yet  but I watched  the show  and I think  I know the clip  he's talking about  well if you live  in the New York  area a lot  of us have  been to TV  tapings at this  point  and there's  just a guy  that sits  there and  hits the  applause button  but this guy's  got to be  retarded  to help the  flow of a  TV show  there is no  reason to  applaud at  things that  they applaud  at on the  Tony Danza  show  he'll say  something  like usually  it's like  Regis saying  something like 
[03:09:00]  one of my  daughters  she graduated  from high  school  over the  oh yeah  you applauded  that  it's some  stupid thing  yeah because  she's retarded  and 33  but Tony Danza  will say  something  and it's  just  there is  no reason  for the  audience  to applaud  why are  they applauding  come on in  how's Lucky  she is fabulous  hey sweetie pie  how you doing  she's excited  for Valentine's  Day  yeah she's  all dressed up  and you look

[03:10:00]  to plug  the Westminster  dog show  now that's  that's  it's sad  in itself  that he is  having a  guest on  for the  Westminster  dog show  that's what  he's been  reduced to  so it's  some perky  broad  coming out  with a  dog on  her lap  and she's  going to  talk about  the Westminster  dog show  Tony Danza  goes off  talking about  some other  dog show  that's like  someone coming  on to plug  something  and you plug  the competition  right in front  of them  it's 
[03:10:30]  the guy's  an idiot  and this  this segment  really  he really  sounded like  he was  sedated  somewhere else  yeah  let's call it  somewhere else  somewhere else  why  what is it  it is like  the Super Bowl  isn't there  another one  that John  John O'Hurley  was here  right  and it's  like  isn't there  another one  like  it's like  the playoff  oh that's  the playoff  this is like  best in show  we're like  the best dogs  tonight  they do that  right  this is like  best in show

[03:17:30]  I  don't  even  where  were  we  oh  valentine's  day  advice  from  Tony  Danza  oh  my  god  this  is  ridiculous  is this  the  segment  where he  gets  questions  from the  audience  you would  think  I've  seen  this  done  before  on  talk  shows  right  the  host  asks  the  audience  for  questions  member  walks  up  to  a  microphone  so  you  can  tell  it's  kind  of  pre  staged  a  little  bit  because  the  person  is  already  at  the  mic  they've  picked  someone  they know  what the  question  is going  to be  Tony 
[03:18:00]  Danza  doesn't  even  seem  like  he  heard  the  woman  asking  a  question  and  gives  this  babbling  something's  wrong  with the  guy  that's  all  I  have  to  say  all  right  here  we  go  hey  you  so  great  unbelievable  it's  valentine's  day  everybody  sort of  has  love  on  their  minds  I  know  I  do  and  since  Dr.  Phil's  giving out  advice  I thought  maybe  I'd 
[03:18:30]  give  out  some  advice  so  we're  going to  ask  some  of  our  audience  members  for  questions  and  I  think  you  are  first  what's  your  name  dear  my  name  is  Dorothy  hi  Dorothy  welcome  to  the  show  what  is  your  romantic  question  I  want  to  what  is  your  most  memorable  valentine's  day  my  most  memorable  valentine's  day  it's  interesting  you  asked  me  that  because  I  was  just  thinking  about  it  the  other  day  just  before  I  got  married  I  was  chasing  my  wife  for a  while  and  finally  she  decided  she  might  go  out  with  me  she  gave  me  a  maybe  and 
[03:19:00]  then  I  finally  got  her  to  say  yes  and  I  asked  her  out  for  a  valentine's  party  and  she  turned  me  down  because  that  was  more  than  she  wanted  to  go  it  was  like  a  date  but  a  party  she  had  to  meet  people  so  I 
[03:19:30]  Judd  Hirsch  we  did  a  gang  bang  and  we  played  cards  on  her  back  it  was  fantastic  Riga  I  got  a  flush  and  then  he  shot  a  load  in  her  face  fabulous  it's  a little  different  than  my  favorite  valentine's  day  oh  you  have  a  favorite  valentine's  day  story  I do  alright  what  is  it  was  yesterday  I  was  single  and  getting  a  massage  with  a  knuckle  in  my  way

[03:20:30]  a  pudding  place  in  Soho  sorry  I'm  just  distracted  by the  news  a tank  seemed  to be  rolling  up  in  front  of  a  family  dollar  store  somewhere  in  Detroit  fucking  Detroit  man  it's  not even  a surprise  it's  like  employee  of  the  month  there's  some  fucking  tank  in  front  of  a  family  dollar  store  it's  just  someone  trying  to  go  shopping  it  is  Detroit  it's  just  a  family  trying  to  pick  up  a  few  things  safe  way  to  drive  in 
[03:21:00]  Detroit  it's  no big  deal  the store  had been robbed  while she worked there  and that in fact  just a couple of minutes ago  I had gone and sort of talked to some of the neighbors  and the neighbors tell me that this store has been robbed  and in fact they say that many of the stores  how desperate do you have to be to rob a dollar store  by the way  it's called a dollar store  brand new stores  what are you going to get 78 singles  a big roll of singles  you're finding a strip club  it's just  developing  that's great  let's get to the last Tony Danza clip  because then we have to get to Dale Earnhardt Jr  the hatch is opening

[03:24:00]  no the White House  announced today  that if Vice President Cheney  is found guilty  of any crime  and is he sentenced to jail  his time will be served  by Scooter Libby  that's what they said  Scooter Libby  will do the time  oh okay  okay  well you know  what's interesting about it  it turns out  Cheney and his gang  they weren't even  walking through the woods  hunting  it's not hunting  like you and I  know we're hunting  did you hear about this  they were in a car  they're in a car  they drive along  they get out of the car  shoots his friend in the face  then they get back in the car

[03:27:00]  sack  of shit  he got fucked  because that guy  was supposed to  go on the air  and kiss his ass  and they said  XM is going to  draw more people  with their star  power  yeah  and then Howard  was like  oh man  he couldn't  even say it  did you hear  Howard like  stumbling  like he couldn't  even  he knows  it's such  bullshit  that he had  trouble saying it  there's Howie Math  Dale Earnhardt Jr  hey what's going on  you are talking  to three of the  biggest NASCAR fans  horse shit  oh horse shit 
[03:27:30]  wow  god damn  come on  how do you know  how do you really know  how do I know what  that we're not  NASCAR fans  oh well  this is the NASCAR  station right  well this is 202  you're doing a show  on 144  the NASCAR channel  that's right  tonight from 730  Tate  I'll tell you  who's a huge fan  and unfortunately  he's not here  right now  it's my brother  Brett  yeah  oh really  he's cooking  at the restaurant  he would love  to talk to  Dale Earnhardt Jr  let's start with this  what are you thinking 
[03:28:00]  what am I thinking  well  right now  I got a  driver's meeting  and  let's see here  I got my schedule  right here  here's what's  happening today  we got a  driver's meeting  at 1110  and we got  bush practice  for an hour  what do they  tell you at the  driver's meeting  to be nice to each other  yeah what happens  with that  well they go through  they have the usual  mumbo jumbo  that they go through  like the rules  and stuff  that we all know  and then they talk  they'll probably talk  a little bit about 
[03:28:30]  bump drafting  because of how bad  it was in the shootout  they're really  getting on everybody  about that  that seems to be  a big issue  you think  they're going to  tell you guys  to change anything  probably not  you know  I think that  to be honest  from what I heard  they were really  only concerned  about one or two  moves in the shootout  yeah  and so they're  not going to be  too hard about it  I think the fans  ain't got to worry  about the racing  getting too stale  but  do the officials  ever just tell 
[03:29:00]  you guys  knock it off  well yeah  I mean they'll  tell the crew chief  while you're racing  that you need to  calm down  if they think  you do  and you know  you better do it  or they'll  park you  what's the groupie  situation in NASCAR  what's the groupie  well there really  ain't one  I mean  what we have  is what we call  them are pit lizards  or helmet lickers  or helmet lickers  helmet lickers  I love that one  yeah  and traditionally 
[03:29:30]  you want to  stay away  from those guys  because they  kind of run  they kind of  run around  in circles  oh they stopped  from pit to pit  and just kind of  anything  yeah  hold on Dale  we got some  real questions for you  we got so many  people checking in  right now  Billy Mack  you got a question  for Dale Earnhardt Jr  Dale how are you  we were just talking  about that draft bump  and I'm just curious  we were at Hooters  last night  drinking a bunch of buds  and what exactly  are they going to do  if there is a penalty  they're going to  pull you into the pits  and slow you down  or take some points  off at the end  of the race 
[03:30:00]  or whatever  they're going to  warn us in a  drivers meeting  before the 500  and the drivers meeting  the days  for the qualifying  races  they're going to  warn us before the 500  and that's your warning  and anything you do  in the race  that they don't like  they'll black flag you  I got another question  again  who owns the rights  to your dad's number  three  is it Childress  or Nextel  or DEI  well Childress  owns it  as far as I know  and that  he has the 
[03:30:30]  he has the right  to own that number  as long as  I think  he has a certain  time where he  has to use it  and keep it active  at one point  to where  then it goes back  to NASCAR's hands  Dale  I hate to interrupt you  you called so late  the computer's  going to shut us off  are you kidding?  this is no joke  we just started  the interview  is there any way  you could call us  back tomorrow  or something  or we could try  to figure something out  I swear to god  they're cutting us  off in five seconds  just want to  promote that  you're going to be  on XM 144  tonight from 
[03:31:00]  7.30 to 8  hopefully we'll  continue with Dale  tomorrow  that's it  party is over  everybody go home  speak for being  in the show </pre>
