<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a reflection on their ten-year anniversary in New York radio, contrasting their grueling five-hour live show with the seemingly easier schedules of television personalities like Letterman and Leno.  They used the humorous analogy of navigating Times Square with running chainsaws to describe the precariousness of their jobs, highlighting the potential for immediate termination due to controversial statements.  They recounted defiant acts at WNEW, including refusing to play artists like Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith (even destroying their Springsteen collection and Rod Stewart CDs), and ultimately their firing over the "Sex for Sam" incident, arguing that other stunts, like fireworks in the studio and bottle rockets, were arguably worse.  They also discussed the surprising lack of oversight from station management during their highly-rated early years.  The conversation then shifted to a pulled mayonnaise commercial featuring a gay couple, sparking a broader discussion about their views on various groups and the perpetuation of negative stereotypes.  Finally, they touched upon current events, including a new Coldplay album, Ricky Gervais' upcoming visit, and Dubai's extravagant construction. Patrice O'Neal, filling in for Jimmy, contributed comedic commentary throughout this segment.

The show continued with a humorous exchange between Anthony and Opie about Opie's musical riffs, resulting in an impromptu, nonsensical musical performance with input from Anthony and Patrice.  The conversation then turned to Patrice's positive feedback from Dion at XM radio and Dandy Donnie Wicklin.  A significant portion focused on perceived fallout at Satellite Radio, with Patrice expressing suspicion about Eric Logan avoiding him.  They discussed a controversial, N-word-laced freestyle rap by Shaquille O'Neal about Kobe Bryant, exploring different interpretations and including commentary from caller Malik.  The discussion delved into racial stereotypes and humor, with Patrice sharing anecdotes about the portrayal of black men on television and white people's reactions.  Patrice also discussed a news story about a man losing an arm to an alligator.  The Imus controversy and Pac-Man Jones's apology were also discussed, with Patrice offering central viewpoints and further discussion from caller Rob, who was raised by black parents.  The show ended this segment with discussion about the upcoming presidential election and racial dynamics in American society and popular culture, referencing *Back to the Future*.  The conversation frequently included racial slurs and offensive language.

The next segment opened with Patrice O'Neal making controversial generalizations about white and black people's tendencies regarding crime, referencing Scott Peterson and O.J. Simpson.  This led to a debate about the portrayal of a black mayor in *Back to the Future*. A significant portion was dedicated to "Club Soda Kenny," whose dissatisfaction with his traffic and weather reports culminated in an abrupt departure.  The hosts also discussed a controversial commercial featuring E-Rock, a former employee, and analyzed Lil Wayne's "Lollipop," with differing opinions from the hosts and a caller's interpretation of Shaq's comment on Kobe Bryant.

The show then transitioned into a rambling discussion beginning with crude jokes about Shaq and Kobe Bryant, degrading women, and graphic descriptions of female anatomy and bodily functions.  They cynically critiqued women claiming to "save themselves for marriage," and a caller was described as annoying and possibly drug-addicted, with one host expressing violent fantasies.  The conversation abruptly shifted to Hitler's sense of humor, followed by discussion about Shea Stadium's closing.  Louis C.K. joined the show, discussing his divorce, renewed interest in sex, and fatherhood, sharing a near-infidelity anecdote.  Vulgar jokes about sex and relationships were exchanged.  The death penalty for child rapists, a news story about a woman falsely claiming rape, and several audio bits, including a "Cream Pie Jones" sweeper and a "Portrait of a Cold Cum Eater" movie sweeper, were also included.  A segment involving a Starbucks employee, Patty, involved increasingly vulgar and sexually suggestive questions, culminating in the hosts forcing her to touch herself and having a guest smell her fingers, with numerous jokes about her virginity and sexual inexperience.  The segment concluded with Patty revealing childhood sexual abuse, leading to a more serious discussion before returning to crude jokes.

The final segment focused on Patty's discussion of childhood sexual abuse.  Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O'Neal engaged in a highly sexually charged and graphic conversation with Patty, exploring the abuse's details and its psychological impact, interspersed with crude and insensitive commentary.  They attempted to elicit further memories, mixing serious discussion with darkly comedic banter. The hosts suggested therapy, a symbolic hug, and continued with sexually explicit jokes and comments. The conversation touched upon repressed memories, discomfort with intimacy, and the foster father's actions.  Commercial breaks for Five Hour Energy and Carbonite occurred, and Patrice O'Neal made comedic interjections. The segment ended with further crude jokes and comments, followed by a musical interlude featuring Drew Boogie.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Shop show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Where are you driving to kick somebody out of the house?  No, I'm driving to a television program where I work here in Hollywood.  Opie and Anthony.  John, where do you work?  I work on Long Island.  I can't really tell you that.  What radio station?  No, I don't know.  Exactly!  Opie and Anthony.  I like boobies because I wasn't breastfed as a child. 
[00:01:00]  Aw!  It's like Opie keeps E-Rock around.  For a good suckling.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, that's what we do.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Again.  Again.  Now do it again. 
[00:01:30]  Again.  Now do it again.  You did it yesterday.  Now do it again.  We know we have fantastic jobs, careers, whatever the hell you want to call it.  But we just want to be able to kind of sit back after a fine radio show and go, ah, that  was a really good radio show.  Bask in it for more than, you know, I don't know, 19 hours or so.  19 hours.  I wish.  Two hours after the radio show, you're already thinking, oh no, now what are we going to 
[00:02:00]  do?  What are we going to do tomorrow?  That's what I mean.  It would be nice to bask in the glow of one show for 19 hours until you have to do the  other one.  These hacks like, I don't know, David Letterman, Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, a bunch of hacks.  One hour a day.  Give me a break.  That's easy.  Throw the commercials in. 
[00:02:30]  It's what, 42 minutes?  Come on.  Anthony and I could do that in our sleep.  In our sleep, I say.  I've done this show in my sleep.  Are there some variables, though?  No, there's not.  They have to actually be seen.  Right.  So you could come, you could just kind of come in.  I think being seen takes about two hours and adds it to that.  That's true.  So you guys might be better than Letterman an hour and a half.  Hour and a half?  Hour and a half better than Leno and Letterman because they have to come out in a different 
[00:03:00]  suit every day.  You can actually wear the same drawers if you want.  Oh, crap.  I watch Letterman.  I go, that's really just easy.  How hard could that be?  He's got guys writing his jokes to start the show.  His interviewing skills are fantastic.  So that's pretty much like a no-brainer.  And then he throws a little skit in there.  Yeah.  And then he has his monkeys run around and do things.  And then, like, the show's over.  We do five hours plus of radio a day. 
[00:03:30]  Too much radio.  Too much.  Too much radio.  Who came up with this schedule?  Who in radio decided that you need to do four to five hours a day?  No, I say we need to do two a day, two hours a day, and get paid the exact same amount.  Here comes the instant feedback.  Oh, I know.  You guys are prima donnas.  Well, I was just thinking about how ridiculous it is.  Yeah.  Because what happened, I'll tell you what happened, you know, the reason most radio shifts are 
[00:04:00]  four hours is because this all started, for the most part, just jocks playing music.  How hard is that?  Yeah.  You're just kind of occupying the chair, and you're like a human jukebox.  And then it developed to a point where some of these guys broke out and got to talk more  and more and more.  And some dopey radio exec never figured out that, wait a minute, now that they're talking  more and more, we should cut down their shift and we're going to still get the same value  from these guys.  There are guys in New York City radio that are pushing a million dollars a year to play records. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Records.  God.  Wouldn't that be something?  And then the dopey radio column is right about them, like there's some kind of radio gods.  This week.  They're nobodies.  Make sure you tune into Slappy and Wappy as they run through the top 500 songs. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  What?  They're nobodies, and they come from the old days where they just have to have a steady  hand to find the track with the needle when they're putting it down on the record.  Quit your effing whining.  Huh?  Casey Kasem overrated.  Oh, big time.  Casey Kasem.  Hey, Casey used to read letters.  It's like a difficult thing to me.  Listen to him until you can hear the work.  What does he do? 
[00:05:30]  The guy has to be up on, he has to have his pulse.  He has to have the pulse of America.  He has to be up on it.  No, he doesn't.  Someone goes, Casey, here's the list.  Thank you.  When do I read the letter?  Yeah, and then he reads one letter, and then he counts down the top 40 songs in America.  How hard is that?  Someone else in the back room is calculating that and calling record stores and all that  and figuring out what the hot songs of the week are.  Yeah, he's not making phone calls. 
[00:06:00]  This is a little disrespectful, Obi.  I don't think Casey's on the phone.  What's number 39?  But have you ever in your life had to get up, okay, and then after this, what if you had  to go and be the voice of Shaggy and Robin from the show?  Yeah, you know.  I'll give him that.  You've never had to go, you know, be a voice of a nation and then the voice of children.  You've never had to do that in your life.  Don't disrespect the guy.  No, I think, look, I started radio when I was 18, and I was a music jock. 
[00:06:30]  And even early on, I'm like, this is the biggest joke ever.  I'm like, I'm actually getting paid to just play music on the radio, and then I get to  steal all the records and CDs when my shift is over, and I got girls just calling all  my long, wanting dates.  Are you kidding me?  That's why you get into radio.  And when you're young, that's cool.  And like, who wants to work, especially when you're young?  But then somewhere in there, I was like, I can't do this the rest of my life. 
[00:07:00]  This is a joke.  But some guys out there are still doing it, realizing it's a joke, and they think they're  important.  They're not important.  No.  If you talk for less than a minute, an hour on your radio show, you're really not important.  Okay?  If you're just reading what's written by the program director.  Yeah.  We will talk at least...  About an event?  We'll talk at least 40 minutes this hour alone.  Well, the seat of your pants thing is that, you know, you joke around and stuff, but the 
[00:07:30]  Letterman and the Leno thing, the seat of your pants every month, five hours, this is why  I think radio guys should, they're being fired, should go a little bit higher than the average  person.  Like, you should be allowed one hour to really mess up, like really, for real, for five hours.  And people out there don't even, to entertain or to even, I don't even know what this is  supposed to be for five hours.  And if your mind, if you're not strong enough to understand that there's somebody in a car 
[00:08:00]  right now that's like, if I for a second say there's somebody in a car and say, shut up,  you fat idiot, you make me sick when you talk.  Like, when I think about that, that messes your life up when you think, I don't even want  to hear him talk.  Like, you just go, you gotta be mentally tough.  I want to, I want to take Patricia's thought, whether you agree or disagree with what happened  with Imus, right?  He's doing four hours of, of, of, of just making it up radio every morning.  Right now say what he said. 
[00:08:30]  We're not allowed to on the air, but I'll say right now.  That was two seconds, two seconds that day.  He probably talked for 40, 80, 120, 160 minutes.  That would be what?  Two hours and 40 minutes, something like that.  Yeah.  Two seconds and he lost his career for a while.  Two seconds.  That's like, this is what, I, I finally figured out what our jobs are like.  Because none of this is scripted.  We could get fired today for saying something stupid. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, no, no, oh.  Because usually when you say that, it's like, wow, listen to the tape.  He said it.  This is, I'm going to describe our jobs perfectly.  New York City, Times Square is a very busy place.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Anthony and I are given chainsaws.  New York City allows us to walk around with chainsaws.  I like this so far.  For four straight hours.  Uh-huh.  And we have to just walk down the sidewalk with chainsaws.  At times through.  And they're running?  Not running. 
[00:09:30]  Just walking and maneuvering and hoping we don't, we don't hit anyone with our chainsaws.  No, I mean the chainsaws are like running.  Yes!  Okay.  That's our job.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  So we're walking around.  You need a job to run through the city with chainsaws.  It's the risk, we're risking our careers every day, just like if you had a chainsaw and you  were walking around a busy city.  Like through Times Square.  And your whole job with the chainsaw was to make sure you didn't touch another human being.  It's running, the chainsaw is going full blast, and we're just, wah, and you're walking 
[00:10:00]  going, excuse me, excuse me.  Yeah, yeah.  Watch out.  Oh no, watch your back, watch your back.  Yes, that's great.  Oh, that's great.  That's radio.  I like that.  But.  I want to do that now.  There's no buts.  Contest.  That's radio.  And then you're thinking while you're maneuvering with the chainsaw, you know, I think I can  maneuver around these people.  The next thing you know, ah, you take off and off.  Ah, you hit someone in the back.  Also meaning you just lost your job because you said something stupid and racial.  Here's the, here's the, I like that analogy. 
[00:10:30]  But the thing about that analogy is this, you have to add in that there's somebody else  judging arbitrarily what damage the chainsaw did.  That's what, that, like, there's someone else that decides that this is a chainsaw injury.  Right.  And not only.  I'm with you.  You don't even have to cut the person.  They could have just been.  Scared.  Scared of the loud sound of the chainsaw.  Patrice, I'm with you.  Just to follow with my thought, you're allowed to have the chainsaw.  And when you do nick somebody, you're like, look, man, I really was trying to be careful 
[00:11:00]  here.  Here's my job.  They gave me this chainsaw to run through.  But the guy.  A walk through Times Square.  I didn't know the guy was going to, like, move his elbow out at that given moment.  Well, you've got to watch for that.  But the guy could go, the guy that you nick with the chainsaw could go, oh, dude, I saw  you.  You're the chainsaw guy.  It's cool.  That's what I'm saying.  There's another person going, I don't care that that guy doesn't care about his injury.  Yeah.  He's injured, and I'm going to care about him.  Right.  His fictional injury. 
[00:11:30]  That's what radio, it's fictional, it's a bunch of fictional injuries that you're trying  to.  It is fictional injuries.  It's sorry about your injury that no one thinks was an injury.  You know, that's like you have a car accident, a fender bender, and you both go, you cool,  you cool.  But then someone else goes, nope.  Nope.  Lay down and put your neck thing on.  You have whiplash, you just don't know it.  Radio is the dumbest job, it has to be said. 
[00:12:00]  We are now talking through these things, and we don't even know if anyone's listening right  now.  Well, I assume they are.  You don't know if they're bored, if they're laughing, if they're changing the dial.  You have no idea.  That's why I like doing the show in front of a live audience.  More and more, we're getting bigger and bigger audiences on Fridays over at the other joint,  because then you kind of say something, and all of a sudden you see a laugh happen.  You're like, oh, okay.  Well, that worked.  All right.  They responded to that. 
[00:12:30]  I do that for a living.  I personally hate those people in there on a Friday.  Oh, really?  Because it's like radio.  It should be a bunch of people out there.  If someone's cracking up and someone else is just angrily not laughing, just like, I hate  the...  It makes you feel like comedy, because it's instant gratification.  You could go on a rant here and just...  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  It's almost like you're a sociopath, because you're just by yourself ranting, and you're  talking into something. 
[00:13:00]  And it really is a...  What do they call it?  Megalomaniac?  It's all about you when you're talking, because right now, I'm not saying nothing.  But I love to hear myself keep saying nothing for hours.  Somebody types, and they just feel the need to type.  This is why I hate this, the world, what it is now.  I hate computers.  I try to do the MySpace thing.  Bloggers.  I hate the fact that someone can reach me now.  I just...  Like, if you hated Clark Gable in 1950...  Oh, my God.  The pain in the ass you'd have to go through. 
[00:13:30]  You have to really hate Clark Gable, or even really love him.  There's no arbitrary...  You know what you would have to do?  I think he opened it up like, my dear, let me look at this letter.  I'm going to check this letter out and open it up special just for this person.  If you hated Clark Gable...  Dear Clark Gable, I love you.  You're fabulous.  I loved your last motion picture.  Well, that's wonderful.  It never happened like that.  There were publicity people that opened everything, that sent, like, signed pictures.  The star never mingled with the audience. 
[00:14:00]  Ever.  They had a club store to Kenny that filtered everything.  But if you didn't like Clark Gable back in the day, you pretty much had to hire a stage  coach to make sure Clark Gable knew you hated him.  You had to go...  You had to write your letter.  You had to go find out where to send it, where it hopefully might reach you.  Yeah.  Right.  Now all somebody has to do is just write...  That's right.  Send it to Clark Gable.  Care of MGM Studios.  Yeah.  Like, it's going to get to him.  It's a big pile of letters that gets sent to some huge Hollywood studio where some interns 
[00:14:30]  would open them up and put in the appropriate response cards.  Another thing about radio, Anthony and I have gone on some crazy rants, yelling and screaming,  complaining, and then someone has to awkwardly come into the studio and go, um, something  happened at the transmitter.  You guys haven't been on the air in the last five minutes.  There was an emergency broadcasting test.  Right.  Also, we stopped getting in our tracks and we're like, well, ah, the rant's not that important 
[00:15:00]  if no one's hearing it.  So, I guess we'll just have to stop immediately.  I say all this because...  Turn your emotions off.  Yeah.  There is always a point to our crap, believe it or not.  And the point being that this Friday is the, uh, and it amazes me to say this, but I will.  This Friday will be the 10th anniversary of Anthony and I coming back to New York.  I say coming back because we were born and raised in the New York area. 
[00:15:30]  Uh, coming back home to do radio.  Yeah.  10 years ago on Friday, we started our, uh, New York radio careers at WNEW.  Where'd that go?  Here in New York City.  10 years ago, we went from Worcester, Massachusetts to the Big Apple.  The Big Apple.  And E-Rock has been pulling clips from our first show at NEW.  Uh, first two shows because, uh, you played a lot of music.  Of course we did. 
[00:16:00]  First couple of shows, but, um, we're going to have some, uh, clips tomorrow to tease for  Friday.  Yeah.  We, uh, let it be known, Anthony and I decided to become a talk show host.  How great is that?  We just decided, screw it.  We're not playing music anymore.  We didn't like it.  We personally didn't like the music.  Right.  So we decided to just stop playing it and talk.  I swear to God.  You think this whole thing was figured out with corporate guys and program directors and,  well, the New York program director has to get together with the LA program director and 
[00:16:30]  they're going to decide what to do with Opie and Anthony.  No, one day Anthony and I were driving home together to Long Island and said, you know  what?  This isn't working.  This music that we have to play sucks.  We're going to just start talking.  Yeah.  And that's how it began.  No one saw the, no one saw the light.  We saw the light.  We're like, if we continue playing this music, we will not be doing radio in New York City  anymore.  No one came running in like, uh, hell no.  Oh, I remember, uh, and she's a good, she's a good, uh, she's a nice person, but I remember 
[00:17:00]  the music director, I don't want to say her name, would run in with her arms folded like,  yeah, you guys blew off six songs last hour.  Yes, we did.  Why am I even scheduling music?  And Anthony and I would look at her and go, well, yeah, why are you?  Because we're not going to be playing it anymore.  Yeah.  So you could stop.  Don't work so hard.  Right.  You, so no one came in and said, play music? 
[00:17:30]  No.  Not even like, play music, but play music.  What are you guys doing?  They were like, you got to play some of the currents.  We were running the place.  No.  Which was good and bad.  Was that BCN?  No, I said NEW here in New York.  No, no, no.  Oh, here.  Yes.  So when you first came here 10 years ago, you just made a decision not to play music.  Well, we started, we had to play, this is going to get a little too inside, but when  we went to NEW, we worked for the same company that ran the station we're currently on here 
[00:18:00]  in New York, and CBS FM.  So the problem was like, the new alternative rock was being played by K-Rock.  The older stuff was being played by CBS FM.  So there was this weird niche with NEW.  They wanted them to play basically all the music.  All the crap no one else would play.  Right.  No other radio station would touch.  That was NEW's playlist.  Swear to God.  I'm like, F this.  I can't remember some of the bands.  Maybe E-Rock could find that on the first couple of shows. 
[00:18:30]  Just who gives a crap bands?  Dire Straits.  Dire Straits.  Dire Straits.  You're missing something.  Well, the Eagles, I mean, thanks for proving my point.  I'm missing something in my brain.  Yeah, that obscure band, the Eagles.  Like, if you work for somebody, I really appreciate you guys, your defiance.  Yeah.  I'm with that.  But what I'm saying is, if you have to cook something at McDonald's, if you're in charge  or whatever, the fries, and you just go, you know what, I'm so fed up with, I'm only 
[00:19:00]  putting nuts on the Sundays, and they just go, okay, cool, you know what, you just decided  you're going to put nuts on the Sundays, but, like, if something had to happen, like, you  just decided, I'm changing my job description, but I'm saying, did they go, I don't care?  Like, why didn't they care?  Was the ratings low, and they didn't care?  Oh, yeah, it was just a disaster.  It was just a complete disaster.  They really just was like, ah, who cares?  They left us alone.  Yeah.  And then eventually, you became Opie, and then how long after you just took over, did 
[00:19:30]  you really, did they go, oh, now you guys are, I remember almost, I think it was close  to six months we weren't tracking, and then they were whispering around the halls, like,  see, these guys aren't that big of a deal.  See, I told you, all the old jocks over there were just hoping we would fail, and they're  like, see, they're nothing special.  And I remember hearing that and going, you know what, Ant, we got one move here, and that  is to talk and get rid of this crappy music.  And sure enough, the next trend came out, and we went, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, 
[00:20:00]  bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, and we went  up, up, up, up, up, up.  I forgot.  What?  This is some of the stupid stuff we used to do.  At one point, we bitched about having to play a Patti Smith song because we hated her album  cover for, uh, easier, what is that?  Easter.  Easter, yeah.  Uh, we hated it because she had armpit hair.  So, yeah.  So, we didn't want to play her song.  Yeah.  We also had to play the likes of Johnny Lang, Grant Lee Buffalo, EMF, and Blind Melon. 
[00:20:30]  And after you get past No Rain, you try to figure out a Blind Melon song to play for everybody.  And, uh, Unbelievable.  Yeah.  What do you do with EMF?  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they would come in and just scratch their heads because, like, we would see the Patti  Smith, uh, uh, or Smythe.  No, it was Patti Smith.  That's right.  Yeah.  The one with the armpit hair.  And, uh, and, yeah, she had armpit hair.  We're like, we're not playing this broad. 
[00:21:00]  Play her.  Our reasonings for not playing stuff was just.  It was really silly.  It was just out of control.  This is gay.  And we'd throw the CD across the room.  We wouldn't play Rod Stewart.  And, uh, we took a big chance.  One day, just because we just were fed up with everything, we decided to just give away  the entire Bruce Springsteen library on the street.  Because we had it with Bruce Springsteen.  We didn't want to hear Bruce anymore, so we gave away all the Bruce in the building.  And to do that, and to do that in New York City, that's just not, that's insane. 
[00:21:30]  That's not normal.  We're like, you know what?  We're sick of Bruce Springsteen.  So we took the entire catalog and we went on the street and we gave it away.  And then we played Rod Stewart baseball because we thought, you know, it was better to like,  you know, hit his CDs with a, a, a, a, a wooden baseball bat.  Yeah, a bat than play him.  Than play him.  So when you was playing, when you were, when you were, when you were, when you were playing  music, like when you were following the, the, the format at first, did, um, did you, 
[00:22:00]  were you personalities?  Meaning, were you able to be opening an in-between music?  Yeah, we would try, we would try, you know.  Yeah, that's how we were hired, to be Opie and Anthony for, uh, maybe seven to eight minutes  an hour.  Maybe, maybe ten.  Push ten minutes an hour.  So you would be, you guys, so that's what I'm saying.  You just weren't like, all of a sudden, some dudes, uh, smashing the Springsteen.  They just, you kind of was there.  Yeah, we kind of figured out the initial kind of, uh, rough-edged version of Opie and Anthony 
[00:22:30]  up in, uh, Massachusetts, and then when we came here.  Oh, oh, Steve reminded me, because Steve was pretty much back the, uh, was, uh, with  us back then.  Uh, then they decided they're gonna just, you know, buy brand new Springsteen CDs, and  that really pissed us off, and we started smashing them in the studio.  So then they had to keep the Bruce Springsteen, I'm serious.  Yeah, they had to hide it.  They had to hide the Bruce Springsteen catalog.  So when we were done with our shift, the next guy would bring in the Bruce Springsteen 
[00:23:00]  CDs to play.  And there's no threatening or firing in there.  Hell no.  No, that was the funniest part of it.  Then, like, they wanted us to play, um, Rod Stewart, Do You Think I'm Sexy?  For some dumb thing they were doing.  Yeah.  And I refused to push start on the CD player.  Anthony refused to push start.  So if you were listening to the radio that day, you heard 20 to 30 minutes of Anthony and  I arguing, who's gonna push play on the CD player?  Because it would have been so gay to hit play for Do You Think I'm Sexy, you know? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Rod Stewart's song.  And then the GM came down with a baseball bat, and we're like, I'm sorry, we just can't  do this.  And then finally, I think, this sounds hack, but it really is just how it worked out.  Finally, we got, like, the cleaning lady that didn't even speak English to come over  and push play on it.  Yeah, she had to push the button.  Yes, we refused.  Yeah, or Eddie the Mail Guy.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yes, Erosh. 
[00:24:00]  When you were giving the Springsteen CDs out, too, there'd be times where something would  come up on the playlist, and you'd go, all right, and you'd start looking through the  library.  That CD wasn't there, so it gave you an excuse to talk more.  And then the next day, along with the Springsteen, everything would come back in.  If you didn't smash it, you took them down the street and gave them away again, and then  had to argue with the PD at the time, and the music lady, saying, we don't have this  music, we can't play it, so we've got to talk for the whole rest of the show.  Yeah.  Just, yeah, if you're in radio, you're playing music, and you want to talk more, just throw 
[00:24:30]  away the records.  Yeah.  Then you can't play them.  We mention this because this Friday, our 10-year anniversary, starting up in New York radio,  even though we've only done seven years and nine months of radio.  Yeah, yeah.  Two of those years were spent, you know, kind of on a long, extended vacation.  That was the bad part of not having a boss.  The good part, we did whatever the hell we wanted.  The bad part, it bit us in the ass, eventually.  My, how things have changed.  It finally bit us in the ass. 
[00:25:00]  Wait a minute, so, oh, jeez.  Well, who was the people, who didn't, popped out of nowhere and was in charge and fired  you?  That was just it.  Well, the corporate guys, you know, ended up firing us, finally.  We were running the radio station.  But other than that, the corporate guys are like, I don't, who are these dudes?  Until you messed up?  No.  They had no plan until they decided something was bad.  Then all of a sudden, the ratings just went through the roof, so then they pretty much said,  let them do whatever the hell they want. 
[00:25:30]  It's working.  Yeah.  Swear to God.  Until we, you know, did whatever we wanted and went too far.  And all of that freedom, you never messed up on a level high enough.  Many times.  Oh, my God.  We listened to some of the old tapes and we should have been fired.  Many times.  Many times.  But the ratings were so good.  They're like, well, let's get them through this.  But then we took it all the way to a couple having supposed sex in a church.  Name three incidents.  Oh, my God.  Name three incidents that you think personally was worse than that. 
[00:26:00]  We should have gotten fired.  We should have got, maybe not worse, but things we should have gotten fired for.  No, no, personally worse.  Like, you was like.  Worse than what?  The church?  To you.  How is it worse than the church, Patrice?  No, that is the biggest.  I don't look at some people.  Anthony's going to answer your question.  No, that's a biggie.  Like, we were firing off fireworks in the hallways of N.A.W.  You would get fired for that.  Fireworks.  We were shooting bottle rockets from girls.  And believe me.  No, person.  I'm saying.  It wasn't a bottle.  You think that you did, like. 
[00:26:30]  Okay.  After the.  After the.  How about nothing?  The answer is nothing.  Yeah, there's nothing bigger than that.  The answer is nothing.  Nothing bigger than that.  Hindsight.  I'm talking about.  Nothing.  We should have got fired for any of this stuff.  We should have even got fired for the Sex for Sam thing.  Right.  Okay.  I see what you're saying.  All right.  Nothing.  How about the girl smoking?  The girl.  Not out of her mouth.  But when you got fired.  I'm saying.  Okay.  Say.  Okay.  You got fired for that.  Patrice.  There's nothing there.  Wait a minute.  Let me finish.  All right.  You got fired for that.  But then you go.  We should have got fired for that. 
[00:27:00]  No.  Like.  You would put up something against Sex for Sam.  No.  That is way worse.  Patrice.  Why are you paying attention to this?  Patrice.  Stop.  Do you understand my question?  Yes.  There's nothing.  We were surprised when we got fired for Sex for Sam.  Yeah.  That was.  So if we were surprised we got fired for that.  Then what else could have possibly.  We've been fired for.  Radio was different back then.  When you screwed up.  They call it screwing up.  You screwed up and then you got a raise and you got a better job.  That's just how radio worked.  We were the first jocks that got fired with massive ratings. 
[00:27:30]  Like what?  You're firing us?  What?  I thought Buffalo.  This goes against everything that we did.  You know.  That came before us.  I thought our TNA with ONA and Buffalo was going to get us fired.  But that wasn't even on the radio.  I know.  Which is the oddest.  That would have been the most amazing firing ever.  Jock's getting fired for something that was never even on the air.  Yeah.  I mean the Voyager bus shut down Manhattan, Patrice, with naked teen girls on a bus.  Yeah, it was a biggie.  Showering and stuff. 
[00:28:00]  That was a biggie.  With Clinton's motorcade getting involved.  That was a biggie.  Was there anything you did that you said, ah, let's not do this one?  Back then.  Really?  Nothing.  I don't think so.  No, we were out of control.  We tried everything.  It was hard to sleep at night.  We were out of control.  Runaway effing train.  I'm serious.  So God came in and did y'all a favor and calmed you down.  Well, it was can we top that.  Yeah.  We played can we top that. 
[00:28:30]  And then we finally learned, no, you can't.  Nope.  Can't top that.  So I'm sure it's going to be a big, you know, the word he said, you get dumped for yesterday  where I couldn't believe.  Which one?  Scum, but you can't say.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  That was amazing when he said that to me.  I know.  Yeah.  It was dumb.  But so 10 years this Friday.  So I'm sure there's a massive celebration planned.  I can't wait to see what the what corporate has planned for us. 
[00:29:00]  Yep.  This is going to be exciting.  Oh, I'm sure.  What are they going to do?  Whisk us away to somewhere cool?  I'm thinking they're going to.  A conference room?  Where they could tell us we're no longer needed?  I think they're going to hand maybe trips for you and I and our loved ones.  Go watch.  They got something big planned.  I know.  Sure they do.  We'll find out Friday.  And it better not be just a couple of dumb clips from our first show, Iraq.  Sure.  That's it.  We need a hell of a lot more than that.  And a cake.  We need A-list celebrities.  None of our dumb D or C-list celebrity friends. 
[00:29:30]  Nothing but A-list celebrities calling and stopping by.  And if it's a dumb cake with some lame saying on it, I'm thinking like a free concert in  Central Park celebrating.  Oh, there you go.  Our 10 years in New York radio.  I doubt it.  All right.  We're babbling.  877-212-ON-A.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Patrice O'Neal filling in for Jimmy.  Jimmy will be back tomorrow.  And Patrice will be at the Houston Improv next weekend. 
[00:30:00]  A week from what?  July 3rd through the 6th.  3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th.  No.  3rd, 4th, 5th.  5th.  3rd, 4th, and 5th.  3rd, 4th, and 5th.  3rd, Friday, Saturday.  Thank you.  Houston Improv.  She's got eyes of the bluest guys.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  We greatly appreciate you checking us out today.  Ralph from Belleville, who's a faithful listener and instant feedbacker, got it all wrong. 
[00:30:30]  What?  He thought we were doing a wah, wah, wah.  No.  We absolutely love what we do.  We just think it's silly and ridiculous.  Yeah.  Which many people think.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  Welcome to the future.  The future.  I see that Dubai is heading toward the future.  Yeah.  How much money do they have over there?  A lot. 
[00:31:00]  They're making a building that's going to what?  Just spin?  Yeah.  Each floor kind of spins independently.  And the building itself looks like it's oscillating and like a wave, kind of a spirally thing.  It looks very dangerous is all I got to say.  What happens if you're in the stairwell and you get cut in half on the two floors?  A lot of money they're going to need to scoop up Indians that's all over the concrete after some horrible accident happened. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  With their spinning building.  Spinning building.  You don't have to get about 18 of those statues with the eight arms.  Yeah.  With the elephant head.  They're picking people up from rubble from this spinning dumb building.  But at least they're acknowledging the future and trying to do something with it.  What is the future about that?  The future.  The future is about like doing stuff differently.  Flying cars.  Yeah.  Well, that was what the future was supposed to be.  Spinning buildings is not the future.  Higher Regency has a spinning hotel since I was two. 
[00:32:00]  No.  It's one floor that slowly rotates.  Who cares?  That's good enough.  This whole building's going to rotate.  But very slowly.  Yes.  So?  I love my apartment rotating.  Yeah.  I want to see everything.  I want to know what I'm looking at.  Wait a minute.  Each morning.  We all have a view.  And you got to wonder what the other view would be like.  And if your apartment building slowly rotates, you're like, oh, that's what's behind me.  In India, though?  In New York, maybe.  In India, what are you trying to spend to see what?  The next what? 
[00:32:30]  Whatever.  Park views.  I don't know.  Park views.  The next what?  What tree grows in India?  The next...  It's Dubai.  And it's not...  It's not...  Have you seen this city?  It's one of the most beautiful big cities in the world.  It's right on the water.  And so your view changes every day.  That would be cool, man.  Evidently, this is an endorsement for the spinning Dubai building.  Dubai.  I could care less.  You also pull your car into the center.  Whoa.  Because the giant center of the building is hollow.  And that's how it spins around. 
[00:33:00]  And your car will go up to your floor.  Nice.  You park your floor at...  You park your car in your house.  In your house.  Outside of your door.  Nice.  You go out your door, there's your car, you go down to the street.  I like that.  I like that.  They are outsourcing even interesting from America now.  Holy, holy moly, Indians.  I like that.  Come on, Patrice.  Come on.  Let me ask you a question.  If that didn't happen...  Yeah?  This is how you can test it.  If that didn't happen, would you have gone, man, I can't wait to this spinning building? 
[00:33:30]  No.  Never.  Never would have thought of it.  It's a waste of thinking.  Never would have thought of it.  It's not a waste.  It'll lead to something cool.  Even cooler.  I don't know.  Technology.  You just gotta go with the technology.  It'll lead to a terrorist going, mmm, mmm, delicious.  The delicious spinning building.  We can screw this thing up easy.  Oh, my God.  Ooh, there's a terrorist sitting there going, yay.  Kevin from Connecticut reminds me of something.  Dubai has so much money, they just do stuff because they can. 
[00:34:00]  They have a bunch of islands in the shape of the world.  Yeah, yeah.  It's different countries.  That they created.  That's how much money they got.  They made these islands shape like countries and continents and whatnot.  Continents.  Yeah, sure.  So it's a mini version of the world in island formation.  How cool is that?  Some more problem's gonna happen.  Yeah.  Didn't they just, like, buy the Chrysler building?  Yes.  Yeah.  The United Arab Emirates bought the Chrysler building.  Oh, I thought that was Dubai.  Which is where Dubai is.  And stunt brain, correct it, Patrice, it's in the Middle East. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Dubai.  Dubai?  Yeah, Dubai.  United Arab Emirates.  Yeah.  It's part of that.  Michael Jackson moved there.  It's oil money, my friend.  No, you're thinking a different place.  But this is, 25% of the world's cranes are in this city alone.  One city.  In what city?  In Dubai.  What are they building?  They're building spinning buildings.  They're building Atlantic City, Manhattan, and, I don't know, all at the same time.  And Vegas all at the same time.  Everything ain't what we do, though.  They have an indoor ski slope. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  A whole indoor ski resort.  That's why gas is over $4 a gallon now, because they decided they need a spinning building.  A spinning skyscraper.  This isn't just a little building.  This is going way huge.  The way the violence is coming from is because the difference between the people that live  on the street and the people that are living in spinning buildings are just ridiculous.  I don't know about that.  Dubai, there's a lot of rich people, man.  Oh, yeah.  They have a lot of rich people in Dubai.  They're not sharing.  God, I can't wait till dead dinosaur blood runs out. 
[00:35:30]  Dead dinosaur blood.  This whole world.  There is so much dead dinosaur blood to pump out of this planet.  I thought it was snot.  It's just dead dinosaur gook.  Like snot.  It's their bodies, their blood, their bones, skin, everything else.  Just melted down.  Pressure and heat for a few million years, and you have the most expensive stuff on the  face of the earth that everyone uses. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  Well, we'll pay attention to the Dubai thing.  Yes.  We'll keep you posted on the spinning building.  Oh, we sure will.  We finished with that in, what, 2077?  No, they built stuff faster over there, too.  A lot faster.  That's good.  Yeah, because they don't have, like, OSHA.  No safety.  No.  48th floor, missing a bolt.  That's all it'll take.  Look, we had a crane.  One bolt.  I think it'll start to shimmy.  Oh, they got wobbly cranes all over Dubai.  They don't care.  Just keep building.  I'm sure they follow all the...  Just keep building. 
[00:36:30]  Those things are wobbly.  Look at this.  Dubai is like Sim City.  Yeah.  It's like Sim City.  You just get in there, you can build whatever you want.  Yeah, look at this.  They built because they can.  What is that?  That's a city that looks like a palm tree from the sky.  Yeah, yeah.  Built an entire city, reclaimed the water, and people like Brad Pitt bought homes there.  They're a million dollars apiece for the small ones.  We had our friend Ben Mesrick.  That's how you say his name, right?  Yeah.  Bringing Down the House, which turned into the Kevin Spacey movie.  They had a...  What do they call the movie itself? 
[00:37:00]  Because Bringing Down the House was...  21.  21, right.  He's a friend of the show.  And he did about 20 or 30 minutes on Dubai and all the crazy stuff they do over there.  It's really fascinating.  It looks like a palm tree.  Yeah, do a little Google with Dubai.  You'll have fun.  And I'm telling you, the indoor ski slope alone is just amazing to look at.  Amazing.  Look at that.  A palm tree city.  Filthy rich.  Look at the palm tree city, because they can, Patrice.  They laid it out as a palm tree.  I don't understand why there hasn't been terrorist events over there. 
[00:37:30]  Because terrorists and extremists like that hate wealthy people.  Really?  Yeah.  I have a theory, but...  That act like wealthy people.  You know, you could be a wealthy person like Osama bin Laden and lay down in that little  cave that he lays down in, where he looks like he's on a comfy couch, but he's on like  a ledge in a cave, just talking.  And people don't care.  What's your theory, Patrice?  Because that's who's doing it. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, because they're Muslims and...  Yeah, I mean, and I think they have their people they pay.  Yeah.  You know, there's people that get money from those people and take care of business.  That's it.  All right.  Simple as that.  That's what happens.  Simple as that.  Simple as that.  Sometimes it says...  Why wouldn't you...  Sometimes it says simple as that.  Why wouldn't you blow up a fake palm tree island if that's where you, you know, that's  what things go on.  You would imagine that would piss off some people.  We don't even have fake palm tree islands. 
[00:38:30]  No.  All we did is carve a couple of presidents in the side of a mountain.  Yeah.  What do we really do?  Nothing.  No, they get a little more creative than we do over there.  A palm tree city just because they can.  That's unbelievable.  Other news.  Ricky Gervais, our friend, turns 47 today.  Happy birthday to Ricky Gervais.  He's coming to town, what, in July?  Second week in July.  He's going to be at the Wamuu Theater.  We're all going to check out Ricky Gervais.  And guess how many copies of their new album, Coldplay, sold in the first week of business? 
[00:39:00]  I'd say 50, 60 albums.  Remember the record industry was saying, like, you know, music is dead as far as people buying  music and stuff?  Yeah.  730,000 copies in the first week for the new Coldplay CD.  That's a nice week.  Oh.  Man.  Oh. 
[00:39:30]  I've been following Coldplay's career.  This is their transition CD.  The next one, they'll sound exactly like U2.  This is like U2 meets Coldplay.  Cold gay.  Huh?  Cold gay.  You don't like Coldplay?  Not really.  Have I been a fan of theirs?  Speaking of the gay, this is the weirdest story. 
[00:40:00]  Mayonnaise commercial featuring gays kissing is pulled in the UK.  Mayonnaise.  Sounds sexy.  I think the problem I have is, why would they have two gay guys kissing to sell mayonnaise?  Well, draw your own conclusions, my friend.  Do we have that story somewhere?  Why would they go, why would someone think that would be a good idea?  A mayonnaise ad depicting a gay New York short order cook has not brought out the best in its audience. 
[00:40:30]  The commercial for Heinz, New York Deli Mayo, shows an apron-clad man in the kitchen making sandwiches for the kids before sending off his significant other with a kiss and urging him to come straight home from work.  Sweet cheeks.  If he comes straight home, that's bad.  He's got to come gay home.  He's got to still be gay.  And he calls them sweet cheeks.  But the ad was pulled less than a week into what was to be a five-week run after 200 viewers complained, saying... 
[00:41:00]  200 viewers.  It is offensive and unsuitable for children.  Why are people so hung up on what gay people are doing?  Like, does it really affect anybody, what gay people are doing?  Except for those, you know, really flamboyant gay people that are, you know, trying to get rights that no one deserves.  I'm just talking about your average run-of-the-mill gay people. 
[00:41:30]  I'm proud of you today.  Really?  I thought you would just take the other tack, like, you know...  No, I'm like, who cares?  It's like, I don't care enough about gay people.  I'm with you.  I don't care either.  I really thought you were going to go the other way.  Like, F the Fs.  I'm not that proud of him on this one, but I would...  Go ahead.  Why?  Like, knowing what he's all about?  He's still all about it.  He's still all about it.  Here's what it is. 
[00:42:00]  Did you notice the disclaimer that he did add in?  Which gays he was...  He's fine as long as he doesn't know you're gay.  Which means...  That's most of the gay people.  It does bug them.  That's a lot of gay people.  As long as they're white gay and you don't know it, but those...  White gay people.  Those...  Those...  Those ones that you know are gay, that's a whole different story.  Patrice, it's every group on the face of this earth.  It's the flamboyant or the ones that are what I call the troublemakers. 
[00:42:30]  The ones that ruin it for everybody.  The super proud of being them.  The super proud to be whatever the F you are.  Are you including white people in this?  No, we can't be proud of what we are.  White people can't be proud of what we are.  Flamboyantly happy to be white, white people are...  Are called skinheads.  Who cares what they're called?  But it's true.  They're proud to be white.  Now, are you upset with them?  Uh...  Uh-oh.  Let me think.  This nigga said, uh-oh. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm upset with them.  Are you upset with people?  Because they do.  They make it bad because then every other group thinks all white people are racist.  Which, you know, isn't true.  So why are you upset with any black people who are...  I don't like black people that are overly proud of this.  To assimilate to society.  Everybody just lives.  But you associate us with...  We're all like that.  No, I don't.  I honestly don't.  But I say to black people that the black people that are perpetuating stereotypes are ruining 
[00:43:30]  it for the majority of black people that are just law-abiding, hanging out, doing what  they're doing, trying to raise a family.  So why don't you focus on the law-abiding, hanging out?  Because those aren't the ones that I'm afraid are going to bust into my house.  But you treat the ones that aren't going to bust into your house the same exact way.  I do not.  I consider you a good friend.  I have a black friend, Patrice O'Neal.  Don't you got a black guy that does the radio show.  Business associates.  We've never spoken on the phone once. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  You've never called him?  There's never been a text.  There's never been anything.  I'm going to tell you what.  If there was 100 people that you would name, oh my God.  If you got down to 92, it's like, oh my God, I need this person to do something for me.  I need something.  Yeah.  92.  I wouldn't be in the top 92.  So there's eight people left.  And you wouldn't even think to go, hey, maybe Patrice will do that.  Like, I'm not in your top 100.  If this was a Verizon, I'm not in your top 100. 
[00:44:30]  Let's think about that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't have his email.  Nothing.  You don't have it.  I don't have your name and number in my phone.  Nothing.  You'd have to call a few people to get his phone number.  At least.  At least I've had one conversation in the last eight years with Opie.  I don't think I have any black people's names in my phone.  Really?  I don't think I do.  Let me think.  I got a couple.  That's amazing.  Imus is going through problems. 
[00:45:00]  Because I have a racist phone?  All you have to do is be honest.  This is what I'm saying about it.  It's just all you have to do is just be honest with him and nothing will happen to you.  Just be honest.  It's just like he's sitting there trying to go blah, blah, blah.  And he's like, I have two black people on the show.  They work on the show.  And Anthony doesn't have a black acquaintance.  Other than the guys that get his car from his garage over here.  Oh, Jamaican Mike.  But he's Jamaican.  We like Jamaican Mike.  Why are you calling him Jamaican Mike? 
[00:45:30]  Because he's Jamaican.  His name is Mike.  No, his name is Jamaican Mike.  Jamaican Mike.  He's a distinguished guy, man.  I love Mike.  He's great.  He runs that garage.  He really does.  He is the boss.  Literally.  Yeah.  Don't call him Jamaican Mike.  It's Jamaican Mike.  He's always been Jamaican Mike.  Did you call your friend, your white friend's Irish Jim?  There was a couple.  Kenny, what's your nationality, sir?  I'm Kenny the Jew.  Hey, Jewish Kenny.  It's Jewish Kenny. 
[00:46:00]  I prefer Kenny the Jew.  Kenny the Jew.  Hey, JK.  And people go, what's the J for?  Jew.  Why is he Jamaican Mike?  It's because he's from Jamaica.  It's because of his accent, really.  Yeah.  He's very Jamaican.  He's very Jamaican.  It's not like, you know, you can't tell.  But I don't think to call him Jamaican Mike.  My mind goes, oh, Jamaican.  But I call him Mike.  You call him Jamaican Mike.  Jamaican Mike.  Oh, yeah.  You can't say Mike without saying Jamaican when you see him.  What is wrong with it?  It's like he loves it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Hope doesn't have black friends.  Well.  And Norton and me call each other friends, but we're completely not friends.  No.  Really?  Norton, there is.  Is he the top, like, 100 also?  He wouldn't, you wouldn't pop up in there?  I don't even have.  I'm sure you wouldn't.  Let me tell you.  In reality, I don't have, I don't personally have a top six regular friends at all.  Right.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I can't name 10 friends that I have.  I don't have a top anything, but Norton would be definitely in the top 100. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Top 20, probably.  Like, but I would go, oh, yeah, Norton.  Yeah.  And Norton would go, ah, Patrice, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd have to get down to, like, people I bumped into on the street.  That's disgusting.  To get to 100.  Yeah.  All right.  We're very, you know, that's how people are, though.  Why could, you know something?  People like, and this is just the way it is.  For the most part, people enjoy hanging out with people they have things in common with.  Or don't feel alienated with.  Or don't feel, you know.  I like video games. 
[00:47:30]  Like, I'll tell you something.  But I listened, I was listening to a lot of club music down in the Bahamas.  And I'm listening, going, this lifestyle is so beyond me, I can't get a grip on it.  It's just about going down at a club and the bitches and, you know.  I think that's an age thing.  It's not a thing.  No, it isn't.  Because even.  I'm not 57.  Holy mother of Christ.  You look good for 57. 
[00:48:00]  I'm not 57.  Jesus.  I'm not even close to 57.  You're 20 years older than me, and I'm sure that you probably help me.  I'm not even close.  It's not an age thing.  What songs did you hear, though?  It depends on the songs.  Some of them are catchy.  There were a thousand of them.  No, I liked.  I'm not saying I didn't like listening to the songs.  I wouldn't download them from iTunes or anything.  I loved listening to a few of these songs.  But if I hear one or two, I might kind of like bop my head a little bit.  It was, no, no, I'm not talking about the music itself.  I liked it.  But the lyrics, I'm listening to the music going, this lifestyle is so alien to me. 
[00:48:30]  I might as well put on a space suit and go into this club.  Because every song, they're at the club.  They're at the club with the bub and the bitches.  And there's a problem with, and like, if no one has money, they're pieces of crap.  And they got to have good champagne.  Sounds like a song written by Anthony Comey.  What the hell is wrong with you? 
[00:49:00]  But it's just, and everyone's dancing.  And if you dance with this guy's bitch, you're going to get effed up.  And it just like seems to me, it's very scary, Patrice.  I was listening to these and I was very scared.  I'm not into that anymore.  Right now, and I don't know, like I said, because of how I'm feeling right now.  But maybe if I felt better.  But feeling better, right now, I'm very nostalgic.  Oh, you're getting nostalgic.  Right now, I'm becoming very...  You're in that nostalgic phase.  I don't like now.  Like, I'm not into that either.  And I think it's an age thing. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I think music stinks.  I think people stink right now.  Every time I watch anything from the 70s, I'm going to be quite honest.  I watch old Soul Train.  Yeah.  Clips and old things from...  I watch black people from the 70s.  Yeah.  And when I watch black women from the 70s, as awful of a woman as I am now, I look at black  women from the 70s and I go, she was cool.  Like, I don't think...  Look at this bitch.  I want to do something to her.  But back then, I look at girls back then like, she was cool and I can watch her be cool 
[00:50:00]  like a dude.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like a dude.  Uh-huh.  And I know it has to be a better time back then because I look at women with some sort  of respect.  Wow.  That is odd.  Yeah.  We got to take a break.  We're really, really late.  Oh, damn.  We'll continue with this.  What I'm thinking is, what's the top rap song in America right now?  Who knows?  Let's see if we can relate to the lyrics. 
[00:50:30]  Mm.  We've done this with country songs.  Let's do it with the top song.  You'll be able to relate.  On the R&B charts.  Whatever the hell.  What the hell is this shark called?  I'm a gangster.  Yo, I'm flying on a plane going to Bahamas.  We'll get into that and some other things after the break.  We broke out the Carol Miller tapes for today.  Oh, yeah.  I love those.  Because we found out that this Friday is our 10th anniversary in New York radio.  And the Carol Miller tapes are from 1998. 
[00:51:00]  Stick around.  We'll give you a little piece.  This stuff is definitely worth listening to again today.  Opie and Anthony.  Patrice O'Neill.  Call Opie and Anthony.  866-WOW-WOW-WOW.  866-WOW-WOW-WOW.  What?  It just went dead.  Ah, there it is.  There we go.  Rock and roll.  Is this another one of your riffs?  Yeah, I'm working on the lyrics.  Thank you for bringing that up again, Anthony.  Yeah, well, I noticed you've been coming up with some pretty good riffs lately.  Thank you. 
[00:51:30]  I got a side project.  I got a band together.  And I figured I would bring some of my music in.  Huh?  What do you play?  Uh, lead guitar.  Oh, that sounds good.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I also, uh, I'm also the lead singer of the band, and I also write the songs.  But you have a hard time coming up with lyrics.  Yeah, I don't have it yet for this one, but I figured I'd bring the riff in, and maybe  something would, you know, hit me.  Hey, hey, daddy.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  That'd be a good way to lead it, too.  Right here, I gotta start singing, kind of.  No?  Wait, I missed it.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:52:00]  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  That's all I got so far.  You should do something like, oh, yeah.  Right there.  That would sound good?  You know, something like that.  Ah, ah, ah.  Yeah, yeah, something like that.  I don't know if that would have, that's a little too much.  What?  Too much.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's not gonna work.  Yeah.  I think I need a few hey babies, I'm thinking.  Yeah, hey babies.  That's been done.  Hey baby.  Hey baby.  Something like that, I'm thinking.  And I need some juice, like, you know. 
[00:52:30]  I think one oh yeah.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  And then, like, instead of mixing up a little, go, oh, oh, oh.  Oh.  And I need some kind of juice running down my leg.  Yeah, throw that in.  877-212-ON-A.  It's the Opie and Anthony show with the great Patrice O'Neill.  Thank you for that adjective.  The great.  Yeah, we got some XM-er.  I don't know, I don't really know him.  His name's Dion, I think. 
[00:53:00]  He works on one of the XM channels and he goes, Patrice killed at the DC Improv.  I laughed from the minute he stepped on stage.  And I was saying the same thing yesterday, Patrice.  XM World too, man.  Yeah.  Dandy Donnie Wicklin came in with his woman.  Oh.  Yeah.  The soon-to-be-unemployed.  Oh no.  Oh jeez.  No, God, don't say that.  I don't know.  Please don't say that.  It's just a mess.  Have you been getting...  Satellite Radio World is a mess.  Have you been getting calls from people going, um, my account's been canceled. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Like, I think all the comp accounts that we've gotten...  Oh yeah.  ...throughout the years for our friends and relatives, all of a sudden they're just canceling  these things.  Oh yeah.  And I'm not stupid.  Eric Logan is completely avoiding me.  Uh-oh.  Like, hey man, we haven't talked in a while.  Well, I'm here.  Yeah.  So then I write back, well, call me.  And he's like, yeah.  He's like, exactly, nothing for a day.  And then I'm like, hey, you know, what's up?  We haven't talked in a while.  Oh, I'm in a board meeting. 
[00:54:00]  I'd rather have a root canal.  I'm like, well, call me when you get a chance.  Another couple days go by, no phone call.  He's completely avoiding us.  I'm not stupid.  I wasn't born yesterday.  I've been in radio for 18 years.  I know when something's up.  When I first started coming around here, he was a part of the show.  I think there's a bloodbath about to happen.  He was a big part.  Oh yeah.  He was on all the time.  E-Lo.  E-Lo was on all the time.  And now you can barely get a hold of him.  Nope.  It's been brought down to Mr. Logan.  Yep.  It was Mr. L.  That's it.  E-L.  Something is going on down there in Washington. 
[00:54:30]  I'm sure we'll find out sooner than later.  So we got one of the top rap songs in America.  We can do that.  We got the Shaq freestyle rap.  Which is the greatest song.  Maybe we can do a little combo platter here.  Got him thrown off of, got his badge taken away.  His honorary badge.  Although I don't know how many arrests has Shaq made.  But he could have beat a black dude before he said the word, what he said.  Yeah.  He can't rap about Kobe, but he can actually, he can stick something somewhere where the 
[00:55:00]  sun don't show.  Right, right.  He could use his badge and just beat the crap out of someone.  Yeah.  He was an honorary deputy and they took away his little badge for rapping about Kobe.  And Shaq is saying that he was just goofing, but other people are trying to.  It's not because of that.  Because he said the N-word in there.  Oh, because of the language?  In his rap.  Yeah.  That's the reason they took his badge away.  The N-word.  Not even, not even Kobe, tell me how it tastes.  Tell me how it tastes.  It was the N-word.  He said that.  Yeah.  So what do you believe?  Shaq said he was just goofing around.  Other people are trying to make it. 
[00:55:30]  He was not goofing around.  I can't even.  Look, I don't, I loved it.  But I, you know, I don't want, please don't be dishonest.  Yeah.  Like Shaq, don't say you was joking because, and it was like, oh, that's, that's rap, rap  battling.  But, but rappers do that.  And he was, it was like, if I rap about you, and I said this, if I rap about you and call  you a racist and a rap, and then say you're this and you're that, and some personal things  that I think you did to me.  Uh-huh.  And then I say, I was joking around.  Yeah.  It's like, hmm. 
[00:56:00]  That's just, come on, don't, Shaq, I'm with you.  I'm down with, I'm with, I love that hook.  It's the greatest hook I've ever heard.  But, I mean, that's, that's what I live by.  Hey, Opie, tell me how my boop tastes.  I mean, I just, I just love that.  But, like, don't tell me that you was joking.  Just don't.  Yeah.  Just don't.  He hates Kobe.  He mentioned his divorce.  Come on, man.  Yeah, he got all personal and everything.  He wasn't joking.  He hates Kobe.  Just say it, Shaq.  He's pretty happy that Kobe couldn't get the job done against the Celtics, I'm sure. 
[00:56:30]  Exactly.  And then he said Pat Ewing, he got more rings than Pat Ewing.  And, like, it's just, for the crowd, it was great.  I guess, for entertainment value, he shouldn't say, hey, he tried his best, but he didn't  do it.  So, I'm sure it's better.  All right.  Well, we got Shaq starting his freestyle rap, talking about Kobe.  Check it.  You know how I be.  Last week, Kobe couldn't do without me.  You know how I be.  Last week, Kobe couldn't do without me. 
[00:57:00]  I call myself big, but I'm not as good as Nicky.  I call myself big, because I live next to Titty.  Excuse me.  Titty lives next to me.  So, in the hood, dog, I feel like P.I.G.  So, yeah, he's not joking.  He's rubbing it in.  But that's a freestyle, like, when he goes, okay, the insult part, where he goes, I live  next to Diddy.  No, sorry.  Diddy lives next to me.  Yeah.  That's a freestyle kind of...  Right, right, jab.  That's on that level of, oh, man, if somebody took that wrong, you'd be like, come on, stop 
[00:57:30]  pointing.  Yeah, come on.  Yeah.  But...  And then here's Shaq finishing.  It ain't about that.  It's about P.I.G., a.k.a.  Big Shaq.  Now, that's the difference between first and last break.  Kobe, tell me how my a** tastes.  I don't even know what that means.  It's hysterical, though.  There's no context to say that.  Oh, it is so funny, though.  What does that mean in context of that rap?  Yeah.  Tell me how my a** tastes.  Tell me how my a** tastes. 
[00:58:00]  It's hilarious, though.  Yo, Kobe, tell me how my a** tastes.  Like, where could he say...  Like, what was he meaning?  What could he say?  He said he was joking.  But he didn't go, hey, Shaq, elaborate on your joke.  What was the joke where you say, tell me what that tastes like?  I'm just thinking in basketball terms, I'm thinking Shaq is dunking.  His butt is up in the air.  Okay, well, you know.  And Kobe is sitting there watching Shaq, you know, dunk because he can't do nothing about it. 
[00:58:30]  And he has to, you know, get a sniff.  A basketball metaphor.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, he's that high, and it's matching up with where Kobe's face would be.  It would make more sense if he made that...  If that was the case, it would make more sense to be after he won in Miami.  Right, right.  To say that.  Mm-hmm.  But he's been losing...  He lost two years in a row.  Yeah.  You know, he hasn't been in a championship two years in a row. 
[00:59:00]  Kobe lost in that.  But I don't...  Tell me how my...  I think it's a basketball thing.  You think so?  I think it's a basketball thing.  I don't know.  I'm starting to go...  That's a good one.  That's a little double entendre thing.  There's a couple things going on.  A double entendre.  Kobe, tell me what...  I don't think...  I don't think it was a well thought...  I think he literally was like...  Yeah.  Nigga, lick my underarm piece.  Yeah, but how else would he, like, be tasting his blank? 
[00:59:30]  He would have to be up in the air.  Yeah.  Kobe, tell me what...  Tell me what...  Because if he's not up in the air, then that means he's accepting the tasting.  Hey, sir, did you hear the rest, though?  Did you see the one part?  Look, I'm just a white boy trying to figure this out.  I'm trying to figure it out, too.  Listen...  I love Shaq, but I'm not going to say that he was joking.  I refuse to say that.  But it's hilarious what he said, and it's cool what he said.  It is hilarious.  But in the circles he runs, if he was allowing the tasting, then people would be like, well, Shaq, what's up with you, man? 
[01:00:00]  So, basically, it has to be by accident.  So, I'm thinking he had to be up in the air, dunking the ball.  Kobe's there.  Bam, something's in his face.  Tell me...  So, you know what?  Very...  I'm being too analytical about it.  Yeah, maybe.  I think you're 99%.  Matter of fact, if Shaq's listening to this, he's going, ooh, good one.  I'm going to use that.  Oh. 
[01:00:30]  Because if...  Good one.  Because if the tasting isn't by accident, then you're looking at Shaq like, whoa, Shaq, what are you into?  I don't think it's a sexual innuendo.  I think it's that, you know, kiss my booty.  But it's not...  I'm talking about his thing was as a joke.  Well, Malik, who is our expert.  I mean, he's in the field working hard for the boys.  Malik, I'm just a white boy.  You know, set me straight.  Yo, yo, oh, we need one niggas.  What up?  See, I love this guy.  What's up? 
[01:01:00]  Asbury Park.  God.  Have they built anything new there yet?  Hey, look.  Yo, that rap, that freestyle ain't mean nothing, yo.  Shaq, it was a slip-up.  Yo, it was whack.  It was a slip-up.  Malik, wait a minute.  Did you hear the whole thing?  Malik might be on to something, because he was just freestyling.  All of a sudden, you're like, oh, I've got to make something happen here.  And you go, what?  Did I just do some gay lyrics there?  I've got to, like, spin this now.  I don't think it was a gay thing, but dude, he wasn't joking. 
[01:01:30]  Don't say that Shaq didn't mean it wasn't personal.  He talked about his divorce.  Kobe caused his divorce.  It's definitely personal.  Now that I hear it, this is the first time I'm hearing it.  And, yeah, it's absolutely personal.  It's not a joke.  It's not.  That's what happens in freestyle.  By the way, Patricia, watermelon has arrived.  That's not racist.  Kenny's actually handing you watermelon.  Thank you, Kenny.  Just want people to know that.  I better take a picture so I have proof that I wasn't being racist. 
[01:02:00]  That's being racist if you take a picture with me and watermelon.  Exactly.  No, it's not.  That's racist.  I have to prove that I wasn't being racist.  No, you don't.  Taking a picture says you're a racist.  No, there you go.  And then all of a sudden, one of these animals out there get a picture of me with watermelon.  Oh, yeah.  And then it's animation domination next year.  Patrice eats watermelon.  Patrice likes watermelons so much.  His shirt is watermelon color today.  Oh, wow.  I didn't notice that.  It's the same color color you're eating.  That's a goddamn shame that in this world, black people can't eat what we want. 
[01:02:30]  Not the white people, but I'm not going to go for that.  Watermelon or fried chicken.  If a white guy sees a black guy eating what's fried chicken, you just look and go, ah.  If I had better cholesterol, I would ask Kenny to get me a fried chicken sandwich.  Ah, nice.  Not even a sandwich.  All right, Malik, what do you got?  Just fried chicken.  Malik, what do you got?  All right, listen.  Shaq, I mean, I think it was personal what he said about Kobe, but still and all, I think  it was just a slip up for the tongue.  You know, the freestyle is whack.  And keep in mind, Shaq came out with albums. 
[01:03:00]  He's a whack rapper.  He's a whack freestyle.  I will body that dude when it comes to freestyle.  He's garbage.  He's trash.  And a few people are saying that he's basically telling Kobe he had sex with his girl, but  how he censored that, that would mean his girl was wearing the special belt.  Because a few people are going, he's telling Kobe that he blanked his chick.  Oh, that's what, tell me what my, dude.  Okay, Malik, stop it. 
[01:03:30]  See, Malik is doing what we have to do.  What?  He knows that that's foul.  But in white world, we have meetings, black people have meetings, and we refuse to expose  a black guy messing up at white meetings.  But this is a black meeting right now that Malik, stop.  He's saying that he, I didn't know that.  He's saying that he used to bop Kobe's wife.  Right.  And she used to do something, do this and do that to him. 
[01:04:00]  And now every time you kiss your wife, tell me how my taste, that is it.  Oh, damn.  That is it.  Oh, no, he didn't.  What?  No, he didn't.  He can't say I was joking about that.  Wow, that is really bad.  Malik, let's be honest.  Let's not even let, look, I still.  Let's not front.  That makes me like it even more.  If I see Sam, I'm going to hug him. 
[01:04:30]  But I'm going to tell him, dude, don't say you were joking.  That is not a joke.  Just end it right now and say, I'm tired of being fake with Kobe.  Tell me how my boob tastes.  Oh, damn.  It has nothing to do with basketball at all.  Because he's now saying, your chick's mouth tastes like my ****.  Oh.  Right.  Which even makes it fowler.  Because he should have said nuts.  If he said nuts, you go, wow.  That's the thing.  Right.  He said, he's calling her a real piece of garbage. 
[01:05:00]  He went to the most awful place ever.  He's talking Rusty Trombone, my friends, for the old schoolers.  He went to the worst place ever.  Oh, damn.  And said she was into, you know, doing the worst place ever.  Can we stop acknowledging that the naked cowboy is, that he exists?  They just had an interview.  They're interviewing.  Ah, whatever.  Sorry.  All right, fellas.  Just threw the whole damn show off track because I'm so sick of the naked cowboy.  I don't do that because my name is true.  Thank you, Malia. 
[01:05:30]  All right, here.  Let's go.  I love him.  I don't leave him.  I got a vasectomy.  Now I can't breed him.  Hmm.  Let's go back to the freestyle rap from Shaq.  Here we go.  It ain't about that.  It's about B-I-G, a.k.a. Big Shaq.  Now that's the difference between first and last place.  Kobe, tell me how my a** tastes.  Okay.  Kobe, tell me how my a** tastes.  Okay, everybody.  Kobe, tell me how my a** tastes. 
[01:06:00]  I'm a horse.  Kobe riding me out.  That's why I'm getting divorced.  I love him.  I don't leave him.  I got a vasectomy.  Kobe, now I can't breed him.  Kobe, how my a** tastes.  Everybody, Kobe, how my a** tastes.  He just keeps pounding on it, too.  This is the greatest hook since Blue Suede Shoes.  This would be a hit song.  It's genius.  What they're going to do, they're going to get a real rapper.  They're going to get Shaq in the studio.  He's going to do that line a couple times. 
[01:06:30]  I'm telling you, within two weeks, there's going to be a massive song on the radio with that hook.  Right, Patrice?  They're going to sample Shaq doing that, and someone's going to really do the song justice.  The freestyle rap justice.  There you go.  Jesus.  He said Shaq gave a mill, and I don't do that because I had a vasectomy, and I don't breathe.  But Shaq had a vasectomy because he got a lot of kids.  So, Kobe snitched him out years ago.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  A lot of people hated Kobe for that because he was snitching.  Wait, what did he snitch him out about?  He was snitching out.  When he got in trouble with the rape beef, Kobe just started just telling on everybody, like, what about him?  He gave a girl a million dollars to shut up when he got her pregnant.  And what about it?  Kobe was a real...  I hear that Kobe's just not a nice person.  He was a real sucker with that.  The more and more you read about him, it doesn't seem like he has a lot of people that like him.  Are you saying, Kobe, tell me what my a** tastes?  Is that what you're saying to him?  Yeah, I say that to him. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, okay.  Like, I'm not...  There's nothing about Kobe.  I'm 100% on Shaq's side.  I just don't want to ride with him with...  It's like if I was talking to him on the phone and Shaq's like, I was joking.  I'm like, hmm, Shaq.  Stop playing.  Stop.  Stop playing, you know.  That's pretty serious for joking.  I don't want to see no fines.  I don't want to see nothing like that on Shaq.  It's just like, don't say you were playing, because this was...  I don't know what that was.  And he was happy that he didn't win.  He couldn't even contain himself.  Because the whole thing is, Kobe trying to win without Shaq.  That was the whole goal. 
[01:08:00]  That's his whole goal.  Yeah.  He needs a championship without Shaq.  And not only did he lose, he got beat by the largest margin ever in an NBA closing game.  And I was reading an article on that, and the sports writers, they basically said...  Tell me how my a** tastes.  Is that what they said?  Michael Jordan wouldn't lose in that way.  With the big game on the line, LeBron James wouldn't lose in that way.  Basically saying, you know, a lot of people are trying to say Kobe's like, you know, Michael Jordan.  The new Michael Jordan. 
[01:08:30]  And people are like, slow down.  Michael Jordan's not losing by 40 points in the NBA championship.  LeBron almost beat the Celtics by himself in the seventh game.  He had 45 points.  He almost beat the Celtics by himself.  Kobe lost by 40.  Kobe wants to be Michael Jordan, and he just can't get it done.  And Shaq just couldn't contain himself.  Yeah, he's really happy.  Hey, Kobe.  Tell me how my a** tastes.  All right, why don't we take a break so we can catch up a little bit. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, is that fantastic?  A little bit, a little bit.  Patriceoneal.com.  A-O-P.  Nah.  Tell me how my a**.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Yeah.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Because, wait, the innuendous.  See, now that the real thing came out, you really can't even joke about it.  No, now it's so bad.  Now it's offensive.  Before it was like man to man.  Now it's like, oh, so let me apologize for that because that's off limits. 
[01:09:30]  I forgot that that's what it meant now.  Oh, it's so bad.  You know what, Patrice, it's hilarious.  It's all right.  Like you said, it's the greatest hook ever.  It's just, now somebody said it to you in the street, you got to go, what?  I hope.  What'd you say about my girl?  What'd you say about my girl?  I was with your girl.  She ate my a** and I want you to tell me how my a** tastes.  What?  What did you just say, you son of a bitch?  That's how a white boy would handle that.  But you black guys, man, you got to make it into like a rhyme. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, I love it.  I love it.  That will be a song.  I just hope they don't hack it up.  That will be a song.  It's a song now.  Shaq is in a studio right now singing that nice, crystal clear for somebody to use.  That one right there might be a song.  You'll hear that blasting on the radio.  If you go on to Harlem, it'll be on there right now.  Absolutely.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  The stupidest thing is happening right now on the Today Show on TV. 
[01:10:30]  Opie and Anthony, by the way.  You got a guy, he can't be more than what, 19, 20 years old, I'm thinking?  Yeah.  He was drunk with his friends and he decided to swim with the alligators.  And the alligator did what alligators should do.  It took his arm off.  And I'm with Patrice because Patrice said it.  I hate when they kill animals for doing what animals are supposed to do.  Why are you killing the alligator for taking this guy's arm off?  This guy was stupid. 
[01:11:00]  He went into the alligator's environment, right?  That's what alligators do.  And now he's on TV like he's a hero.  And Matt Lauer is interviewing the guy now.  And he looks completely ridiculous.  For more than, why is he interviewing for more than 30 seconds?  The interview is like, oh, you jumped in, you was drunk, you got the arm eaten.  Man.  Well, our next story.  Let's move on.  And he has this face.  This is what bugs me.  He has this, I'm a hero face.  He has a pride to it.  There's a prideful, like, hey, man, I'm working through this thing. 
[01:11:30]  Like, you're an ass who got your arm eaten because you jumped in the room.  And now the poor alligator is sitting someplace.  Dead.  Dead.  Yeah.  Show the alligator, that vicious creature.  There he is on a slab.  Who's been here for zillions of years.  Okay.  Oh, God.  He's actually beat evolution.  Yeah.  It's the only animal that beat evolution, basically.  And alligators.  That is stupid birds.  Baby alligators have to, to be a large alligator, you have to go through a lot of stuff to survive 
[01:12:00]  to be a large alligator.  Yeah.  And this drunk fool is now a hero.  You're not a hero, you jackass.  Yeah.  There's a million drunk fools.  There's not many alligators left.  No.  Should have fed the rest of the drunk fool to the alligator.  Oh, he looked good.  Let the alligator win one.  What the hell?  But now the guy's on TV and it looks like his shoulder muscle's getting tired because  he's got this weird, like, massive bandage where the arm used to be and it looks like  he's trying to hold the whole thing up.  It's the dumbest bandage. 
[01:12:30]  It looks like Spider's Foot from Goodfellas.  Right.  It's all bandaged up.  I hate when they kill him, but I do need some new shoes.  Oh, you might want to call him up.  Get some gator shoes.  Yeah.  You wear those gator shoes?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I hope I'm going to start wearing Mako shark shoes.  I hope they do more attacking, too.  I want people to lose more arms so I can have some Mako shark shoes.  And what is Al Roker scared of?  All of a sudden, he's got a microphone on a huge, like, broom handle.  Al Roker's going to kill him.  They don't want to be too close to the fans, I guess. 
[01:13:00]  Now he's reaching the broom handle that has the microphone attached to it to the people  so they can say hi to their dopey friends back home.  Look at how angry he is with that fake smile he has to plaster.  He is just like a phony.  It came out during the Imus thing.  He really was up in arms, went to NBC Brass, talked about how he doesn't want to work for  a station that supports a man like Imus.  And put out some kind of a statement that was a lot angrier than the jovial Al Roker 
[01:13:30]  that we've all grown to know and love.  Don't be a phony.  Speaking of phony.  And then he turns around and makes a joke about epilepsy.  Yeah.  Which is kind of hypocritical.  I don't care.  I think you should make epilepsy jokes.  Whatever you want to do.  Whatever you want to do.  Speaking of phony, really quick.  Okay.  You're never really quick.  I try to be, but it just doesn't happen.  I wish I had better access.  I wish I could have one word to explain the 10 sentences I have to go through. 
[01:14:00]  But it is what it is.  I should have studied more in school.  I swear to God.  No, I like when Patrice goes off.  But Pac-Man Jones, that statement he made, I just sat on it all night and all day.  Yes.  A guy that loses his career for a year, ostracized, criticized, and just vilified in the media would  make a statement like he doesn't like black people and insinuates that Imus gets fired after 
[01:14:30]  after he beats up a stripper because she reached down and grabbed his let it rain money too fast.  How the hell that went down?  Like, how, like, why do I have to be black all the time?  Because this ass would say, he would make this, he would victimize himself in any way on this.  All he had to do is say, look, man, things happen.  Yeah.  Like, if all the accusations of him are not true, he's been crucified. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  He should be the first one to go, the dude said that he wasn't trying to be racist.  Maybe he was.  But you know what?  He apologized.  He was blubbering like an idiot.  What are you going to do?  It's not really harming me.  But he made a statement that victimized himself.  Please get this guy insinuating that ABC should fire him.  Yeah, yeah.  I will pray for him?  Did you? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  There's a, there's a.  You should pray for your savior prayers.  There's a paralyzed doorman.  Yeah.  From that incident.  That stripping.  There's a doorman who's paralyzed.  A stripper who got bashed in the face because of that whole crew.  I'm not going to say Pac-Man did it because he's, he's, he's got, he found not guilty.  But for him to even put his mark on that statement of in your window that, that, that I should get fired after what he went through. 
[01:16:00]  He's not even reinstated in the NFL yet.  He's, he's allowed to practice with the Cowboys, but he's not in the NFL yet.  So he lost his career.  People are fighting for his career because of allegations.  And this dude makes this statement.  Like, are you, like, are you not well?  Bravo to Patrice.  But no, this is what I'm like.  Why do I have to say what needed to be?  But it's like white people will say it, but you go, you know, you're a racist and I say it. 
[01:16:30]  I'm a sellout.  But it's like, stop, stop, Pac-Man.  Stop.  Right on, man.  By the way, the Imus thing's going away fast.  It was just a small little thing in our page today.  No one really is paying attention to it now.  Small little nonsense.  Small little thing.  I think he did a good job of explaining himself, even if whether it was, whether it was good, whether it was right or wrong.  He's just like, no, I was saying, you know, black guy.  He's sarcastic.  Black people, I'm racist.  My girl says something very interesting. 
[01:17:00]  Very interesting about Imus.  How is that possible?  She's abroad.  I don't know how it would happen.  But when she says it, I give her credit.  What credit's due, I go in a room and I sit down and I go, do I, should I give her credit?  And I talk to my genie.  And that genie says, hey, man, she did make a good point.  And you're like, oh, man.  I go, okay.  I got to give her one.  Damn.  She goes, if he goes, if he knows he's going to be a blubbering fool, why does he even tackle anything that has to do with anything?  Why does he talk about anything if he knows that if somebody comes at him, he's going to do what he did as a blubbering idiot? 
[01:17:30]  Why not just talk about ice cream flavors?  But I think I was discussing this down the hall after the show yesterday.  I think that he's trying to show he's not racist, that he's going over the top the other way.  The other way.  That it's confusing the hell out of everybody.  Yeah.  Like he, in his mind, he really believed he was being sarcastic there.  But if you're a racist guy, which is what everybody thinks he is because of the last episode, you can't do that because then they'll look at it like you're a racist. 
[01:18:00]  He's trying too hard to show that he's all about the black man now.  That it's confusing the hell out of everybody because it's not believable.  And no one was talking.  He goes, my, he didn't say my name.  He goes, he's like my producer.  He's black.  Yeah.  My two co-hosts, they're black.  And I'm sitting there going, if you was doing a tirade, Opie, about how you're not racist and go, I have this black comic on all the time. 
[01:18:30]  We all do that.  I would go, excuse me, what?  Like, you would hear me go, did you just?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I would be voicing those black people who are supposed to be his great, you know, sacrificial, like, thank you to the race gods.  Because there's no, there's no, where are they?  They just have to be there.  They just have to be on the payroll.  He should have just said, oh, I have African art.  Yeah, but wait. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, I have one of those scary masks.  I have a black African mask.  I have a big pot that people boil other people in.  Yeah.  In my living room.  That's how we all defend racism, though.  How many of us have said, what?  I have black friends.  What do you mean I'm racist?  I got a black friend, right?  Yeah.  Or what do you mean?  I'm married to an Asian.  Well, yeah, that was a biggie on this station.  But that's how.  Holy Jesus.  And I'm not mocking that defense.  We all do that. 
[01:19:30]  We reach out and go, what are you?  I'm racist.  Patrice comes on our show all the time.  How could we possibly be racist?  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but that's how we try to.  How could we possibly?  With ease.  Good examples.  All right.  Everybody's racist.  I don't want to hear it.  I completely agree.  Everybody's racist.  Everybody's racial.  I believe that.  Racist, no.  And prejudice, no.  I think everyone has a bit of racism.  Everyone's got. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, racial.  Yeah, racial.  But I can't.  Everything can't be racist.  Racist doesn't necessarily mean you're going around, you know, beating up people of other  races.  Why do I have to like other races?  Or being negative or doing things that affect other races negatively.  It just means, yeah, I could look and go, ah, you know, I don't like the majority of  those people based on nothing but the fact that I just don't.  There's no fact behind it.  You should be able to just go, look, I just want to be able to just go, ah, here we go. 
[01:20:30]  That's what prejudice is.  It's just like you can look at another race and just go, ah, boy, here we go.  Here we go.  Here they go with what they do.  Oh, look, here's the news again.  Oh, boy.  Let me guess.  Don't show me the picture yet.  Oh, there's the picture.  I love looking at white people and going them.  Them.  You see how far I've come in the 60s?  That is good.  I couldn't refer to you people as them.  Yeah.  I like the them. 
[01:21:00]  We were honkeys back then.  And honkeys, what a wonderful term you can say on sitcoms back then.  Yeah.  Honkey.  George Jefferson.  And white people go, oh, Lord, white people.  I'm going to invent something that really pains white people in terms of it.  But nothing pains you.  Cracker, honky, redneck.  Nothing pains you.  Just buy the house next door.  I just want to find a hurt, a real hurting.  Something hurtful.  It ain't going to happen.  Yeah, I'll help you out.  Taxpayer.  Oh, damn. 
[01:21:30]  No, you didn't.  Hey, old melanoma cheeks.  That hurts us.  I like Wonder Bread.  Woo.  Wow.  I'm going to go home and cry.  Cracker.  Cracker, yeah.  Cracker is silly.  All your racial slurs, any white people racial slurs, have a dominant, like the reason you're  called Cracker is from the crack of the whip.  Right.  And redneck is something that rich white people used to call poor white people.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  When they couldn't afford slaves.  And they had to do their own field work.  And they get their redneck.  Oh, there's nothing really.  It just shows you that we're the chosen color because you can't come up with anything that  pisses us off.  That really upsets us.  How about the chosen?  That was a joke for the asses that are trying to get us in trouble, by the way.  The chosen neutral, like, you know.  Yeah.  There's no white version of the N-word.  There really isn't.  There's no horrifying. 
[01:22:30]  And it's been.  But you guys aren't willing to give up on that.  There's been so many years of trying to come up with one.  And they will continue to try, right?  I just don't think there we go.  I think black people have stopped elevating with our racism.  Yeah.  I think white people are still fighting hard to keep on the cutting edge of race.  Yeah.  Black people, we need to invent something.  Hold on.  We got a guy.  Yeah.  We got a guy.  I want to go to him.  His name is Rob.  He's in Columbus.  He's white.  And he was raised by black parents.  Wow.  Are we talking to Steve Martin? 
[01:23:00]  He's the backwards, different strokes.  We got the jerk on the line.  Rob.  Morning, guys.  Good morning.  Wait, you still sound white.  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah.  When I was six months, my parents had died in a car accident.  And their best friends were black.  And they adopted me.  And I'm 37 now.  And you should see how difficult it is when someone accuses me of being racist. 
[01:23:30]  Now, at times, I didn't like my parents, but it had nothing to do with the black.  And needless to say, the family pictures are a little odd in the spot.  Rob, I've got to start by saying, what is wrong with you physically that they allowed black  a black couple to talk to you?  That's terrible.  That's awful.  I'm sorry, Rob.  Did you ever say what you're talking about?  Yeah, the only thing wrong with me physically is I like your guys to show up. 
[01:24:00]  There you go.  I'm just messing with you, Rob.  I know.  But it's interesting when they talk about race.  Sure.  And I mean, the one accuses you of being racist.  How are you?  You know, you guys talk about, oh, we have black friends, or we have Patrice come on.  And how do you even come back with?  I tell someone, well, my parents are black.  No one believes that.  I mean.  Of course not.  Yeah, but we just go for the lame defense of, well, I've got a black friend.  I remember we got in some trouble up there in Boston.  I was like, I've got black friends.  Yeah, that doesn't work. 
[01:24:30]  It's going to be racist.  Thank you, Rob.  Take care.  Stump Brain handed over a little ditty for everybody.  It's quick.  I promise.  Everyone's a little bit racist today.  So everyone's a little bit racist.  Okay.  Ethnic jokes might be uncouth, but you'll act because they're based on truth.  Don't take that as personal attacks.  Everyone enjoys them. 
[01:25:00]  So relax.  Can't we all just get along?  Jared in Boston, listening on BCN.  Jared.  Hey, boys.  Patrice.  Hello, Patrice.  What?  Hello.  You need an answer?  Like, what are you, my girlfriend?  He's trying to, you know, relate or something.  I've been on a conversation here.  Right.  All right.  I'm back.  You know I'm here.  Go ahead, man.  Patrice, you call white people melanoma cheeks? 
[01:25:30]  What are we, cancer cheeks?  That's y'all thing.  That's what y'all get.  No, melanoma is like a form of skin cancer.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were trying.  I thought you were trying for, what's the other word?  Melanin.  Melanin cheeks.  No, no, no.  Melanoma cheeks.  No, you really were.  I absolutely knew what I was talking about.  You really wish we had cancer cheeks.  I didn't wish you had cancer, but that's what you guys get weird cancers.  That's your first.  All right.  I got you now.  Cancer of the neck.  That's what white people get.  Funny cancers, and you get at least something. 
[01:26:00]  Look at John McCain.  He's got more bandages on his freaking body.  What's going on with him?  Every time they had a bandage, his ratings are going down.  He's starting to look like a piece of fruit.  He needs to just sit in vinegar.  Like a rotting piece of fruit.  They just need to put him in vinegar and roll him around in vinegar.  Oh, Pickle McCain.  You know, some ass is just writing boring on Instant Feedback.  Then go find something else to listen to.  Yeah, you effing hater.  I'm so done with these idiot haters that claim they're fans of the show. 
[01:26:30]  Go find something else.  Who gives a crap?  Let me clarify.  Melanoma was the correct word, sir.  Yeah, they throw a band-aid on him, and wow.  He drops in the polls.  Oh, my.  He's got another 10%.  Another 10%.  He's shrinking.  Yeah, he had band-aids all over his head the other day.  God, they're just constantly ripping stuff off of him.  Who wants to look at that guy as the president? 
[01:27:00]  Doctors picking at him like the turkey carcass in the fridge.  You just open it up and pick a little piece of meat off.  That's brilliant.  Yeah, what do you got?  Before you know it, there's just bones left.  That's brilliant.  I was thinking yesterday.  I'm like, what is wrong with America that these are our choices?  Obama, who just doesn't have enough experience.  What?  What happened?  He doesn't.  I'm laughing at you and getting ready to explore.  No, but seriously, what is wrong with America that our choices for the presidency is a guy 
[01:27:30]  that truly doesn't have enough experience.  He really doesn't.  And McCain, that's the best the Republicans can come up with?  This is America.  I finally have a reason why I'm not going to vote for Obama.  That has nothing to do with race.  It has to do with something I saw.  Oh, boy.  I saw, if you remember.  And if it was a white guy and you saw it.  Mayor Goldie Wilson from Back to the Future. 
[01:28:00]  Back to the Future.  If you remember, Hill Valley, before, it was a very beautiful place.  Yeah.  And then when Mayor Goldie Wilson took over, who was the mop guy at the diner, who became  mayor because he was inspired by Marty to become mayor.  Mayor Goldie Wilson.  And he actually won, and Hill Valley turned into crap.  There was a homeless guy sleeping on the bench.  A movie theater turned into a porno theater.  The black mayor? 
[01:28:30]  Right.  You're basing.  I've never seen.  I really don't.  You're basing your vote on Goldie Wilson.  On Back to the Future.  I don't think Goldie Wilson made a good mayor.  Did you just preface that?  Yes, sir.  It has nothing to do with him being black?  Well, I'm just.  Why don't you use the white mayor reference somewhere?  Well, when the white mayor was there in 1955, it was a great place.  How about the fact that Morgan Freeman saved the world from the disaster?  Morgan didn't do anything.  He was just crossing his fingers hoping the white people would blow the asteroid up. 
[01:29:00]  I knew that if you sent, they prepared years to stop this asteroid.  And the black president kept his strength, and the world didn't end.  Well, I'm still just.  How come you couldn't make that?  Because I'm basing it on Goldie Wilson.  The black mayor.  The black mayor in Hill Valley.  Why did you say it's not racial?  It has nothing to do with him being black.  I don't know.  He didn't do a good job.  You know what?  Goldie Wilson sucked.  Why don't you, Opie, I mean, Anthony, tell me how my boobs taste. 
[01:29:30]  Mayor Red.  Why don't you just tell me how my boobs taste.  And by the way, you were hurtful to a lot of white people out there.  So Stephen S. from Bayshore is fighting back.  He writes, Patrice has watermelon this morning.  Oh.  Oh.  That's okay, buddy.  One day you'll get sickle cell, too.  I can't wait for the first white sickle cell case.  Sickle cell.  All right, we got to take a break.  What are we going to do next?  We don't know, because we just make this crap up as we go along. 
[01:30:00]  Somebody wrote Boren?  Yeah, idiot.  Jacket.  Oh, thank you.  Now, Wednesday.  Say, what do you let those boys push you around like that for?  Well, they're bigger than me.  Stand tall, boy.  Have some respect for yourself.  Don't you know if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the  rest of your life.  Look at me.  You think I'm going to spend the rest of my life in this slop house?  Watch it, Goldie.  No, sir.  I'm going to make something of myself.  I'm going to night school, and one day I'm going to be somebody.  That's right.  He's going to be mayor. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, I'm a mayor.  Now, that's a good idea.  I could run for mayor.  A colored mayor.  That'll be the day.  You wait and see, Mr. Carruthers.  I will be mayor.  I'll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley, and I'm going to clean up this town.  Good.  You can start by sweeping the floor.  Wow.  Clean up this town.  He turned it into a mess.  Hill Valley was beautiful.  And that's why you're not voting for Obama.  Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream. 
[01:31:00]  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  Make it.  And it was a great little town, all clean.  Everything was nice.  And then Goldie takes over, and there's filth.  I've never seen this movie.  How did you never see Back to the Future?  There's a few movies that you should see, I haven't seen.  That's one.  Yeah.  And that scene sounded like In the Heat of the Night.  I thought this was supposed to be some-  They call me Mr. Tibbs.  What is his name?  Charlie Fry in the movie?  Yeah.  Whatever.  Charlie Fly? 
[01:31:30]  What?  George McFly?  McFly.  That was awful.  That sounded like a racist movie.  Oh, yeah.  You should see where they lock Marty McFly in the trunk of the band's car.  And one of them gets out of the car, and then Biff's little gang goes,  Hey, why don't you get out of here, spook?  It's a comedy, a fun-filled family comedy with some real racist language in it. 
[01:32:00]  Jesus.  And then the rest of them get out of the car, and they go,  Hey, we don't want to mess with any reefer addicts, because they're smoking a little weed, you know?  This movie is why Obama doesn't get your vote, huh?  Yeah, because Goldie Wilson sucked as mayor of Hill Valley.  The black mayor.  The black mayor, who went from a mop guy at the diner to mayor of Hill Valley.  Something just came upon me.  Yes, sir?  Is this city falling apart with the blind, cheating, coke addict man?  Well, he's the governor, so that's New York State. 
[01:32:30]  He hasn't had enough time to screw anything up yet.  What do you mean?  How much time does he need?  I'm not saying he's going to screw anything up.  I'm just saying he hasn't had enough time if he was going to screw something up.  So then why everything's going just fine with the blind, and may I say,  a blind guy that won't wear the make-you-feel-more-comfortable glasses.  Right, right.  Cheated on his wife.  Wife cheated on him, and he admitted to doing a lot of drugs.  Yeah.  And the city's perfect.  Do you feel less?  Do you feel scared?  Well, the city's, you know, the city is from Bloomberg and Giuliani. 
[01:33:00]  That's why the city's what the city is.  Okay, so then why don't you say the countries will be from, you know, Reagan and Bush.  Say that.  And then go with it.  Don't even let it.  Obama has nothing to do with how this country's going to be run.  Just like the blind guy has nothing to do with how the city is going to be run.  No, he does, but he hasn't been in enough.  He hasn't been in long enough.  How long does he have to be in?  Nah, he's got to be in, like, two years before, you know, you really see what impact he makes.  So let's say Obama has to be in for two years, and then he only has another two to go. 
[01:33:30]  So really, you're only dealing with a Negro president for two years.  For two years.  There you go.  But then, no, because then you're still feeling the effect of what he did for two years into the next presidency.  So it's going to take two years to erase Bush, then another two years to put his stamp on it,  and then the next white guy that comes in will have two years to erase the Negro president.  Right.  And then his own stamp for two years.  So really, you only have to deal with the Negro president for two years of him actually being in 
[01:34:00]  and two years of what he's done.  Right.  So four years you have to deal with the black president.  Right.  You can't deal with a black man for four years out of your life.  From the polls, it looks like that's what we're going to have to deal with.  Yay.  He's a hit.  I know.  You'll feel very good.  You'll be very proud as a black man.  I hope he's the black president that you all are afraid of.  The one that just turns into Farrakhan the second he takes the inauguration. 
[01:34:30]  Fried white baby feet.  Fried white baby feet?  Oh.  Is that what we have to look for?  In the inaugural speech, he'll be eating a fried white baby feet and candied white baby  toast.  Oh, God.  Delicious candied white, candied white baby toast.  Mm, mm, mm, mm.  Well.  That's our new national candy.  No one's really, I don't see this fear. 
[01:35:00]  Obama doesn't strike fear into people.  It's this whole kind of, we're a little iffy about the whole thing as white people.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And the wife gets people a little nervous.  The wife gets people a little nervous.  He just needs to tell her to shut up.  Because he's a politician, so he knows what the majority of the people want to hear.  He's placating to all the races and white people and everything else. 
[01:35:30]  White women love sassy black women, though.  In movies, sure, you like seeing Queen Latifah going like, mm-hmm, let me show you, honey,  child.  I'm going to show you how to do it.  But in real life, I don't think people like sassy black women.  Because they're the ones at DMV.  They're the ones at Motor Vehicle that you got to deal with.  No, but that.  They're the ones where you go to pay a ticket.  Those are sassy.  Those are angry.  Sassy.  Sassy is angry.  No, no, no.  Sassy.  Sassy is the movie version of angry.  Sassy is Florence from Alice.  Like, kiss my grits.  You can't name one real-life sassy black woman. 
[01:36:00]  Yes, you can.  People who work in offices all know sassy black honey child women.  Honey child.  Women that run the office, even the white balls.  Like, when they get up and they come in and, excuse me, I hate to interrupt this important  white meeting, but who moved my stapler now?  And they're like, oh, look it.  She's going at it.  All crazy Joyce. 
[01:36:30]  And white women love those black women.  Like, they go, uh-oh.  And then the white women, that's when they start manipulating.  Like, they trying to make us work on Sunday.  What?  My white friend Karen's, they trying to make us work on, uh-uh.  Black, look it, white America loves, you see it in the sitcoms, they love, they don't  like, what character you never see, you never see an angry, intimidating black dude ever 
[01:37:00]  on TV, ever.  An actual character that makes white people uncomfortable, like an angry black dude or  a sassy black dude, a black dude that goes, uh-uh, honey, not even that.  Just, uh, uh, Nell Carter, you see, give me a break, you see, uh, uh, Florence, there's  a bunch of, like, you know, uh-uh, uh-uh, what, what you say, honky?  And it's like, yay!  Shirley Hemple.  All of them.  You love sassy black women in this country.  Honesta. 
[01:37:30]  Honesta.  Fish eye fool!  Oh, she's so cute, because you're not afraid of them, but you think that that's hilarious,  that they're walking around like, uh-uh, you better shut up.  Now, you never see that with a black, there's never a black man on TV that, that ever is  intimidating.  You don't think George Jefferson was-  He, do you, are you out of your mind?  He almost threw something in your face.  Okay.  Like, if I had hot coffee, I'd throw it on you.  No, I'll give you one.  James!  James Evans. 
[01:38:00]  James Evans.  He was intimidating.  He used to go, remember when he got pissed on that show?  He was, that, he might be the only, but here's, here's James, though.  He never could keep a job.  He was really-  James could never get a break.  He was, he was strong for the family, but weak outside to America.  And he was only, and there was no white people that ever, like, congregated with them.  No.  You know, you never seen James at the office being James. 
[01:38:30]  No.  It was his frustration being out there with white folks, and then at home, he was strong  James.  One of my favorite episodes, and this kind of summed up James and made him look like,  he looked bad.  Even though it made him look bad, was when he was supposed to go down and get a promotion.  Right.  And it wasn't, it wasn't in the bag.  He had to go and talk to the stupid white boss that was very demeaning to him and everything.  But he goes, he was like, Florida, I know I'm getting this promotion. 
[01:39:00]  He's like, James, I'm so proud of you, James.  James.  So he goes, here's what we're going to do.  We're going to take the rent money, and we're going to throw a big party.  Uh-huh.  And then I'm going to get this promotion, and it'll all be taken care of.  Okay.  And of course he doesn't get the promotion.  Of course.  And they blew all the rent money on a party, and I'm just sitting there going-  And he turned-  Oh, see, that's called a certain kind of rich.  Oh, dude.  That's what this-  Oh. 
[01:39:30]  Strong in the family.  Right.  Physically intimidating.  Yes, he was.  Very, had a coolness about him.  Yeah.  But in white world, he was just big old, dumb, goofy Negro man.  But Negro man.  But Nell Carter.  Yeah.  Okay.  And, and, um, which, which, which is very, very, uh, indicative of slavery, by the way,  where black women have been pushed.  They was pushed ahead to be the boss of the family because strong black men were killed.  But that's, read that yourself. 
[01:40:00]  I'm sure.  Jesus.  I know it's a morning program, but listen, but, but, and seriously, um, and, uh, and so  black women, if you, there's, she's not the boss, but unofficially, she, she's smarter  than everybody in the show.  So she's running things, really.  She's running things.  She really runs.  Chief, old crazy chief.  Chief, you crazy chief.  Oh, don't listen to chief.  But he's really the boss.  But all the white kids look at, she's a really dead sassy bed warmers. 
[01:40:30]  That's how they put the, the, the, the, the characters, the black women characters in  there be sassy like bed warmers.  The maid, but they really ain't the boss.  When it boils down to it, shut up or you're fired or you lose it, whatever.  Just like Maude, Florence and Maude used to just-  Right, right.  Her housekeeper.  Um, but if you look at there, it's nobody, no intimidating figure on TV.  Man, in movies it's different, but on TV, your sitcoms is always a goofy or, or weak 
[01:41:00]  black, or not even a black character at all.  Man wise.  There's no intimidating black man on TV.  I don't know.  You're talking sitcoms, right?  Sitcoms.  Okay.  Because white men were completely castrated, especially in the eighties as far as sitcoms.  That's how they really are.  The goofy, do-do-do-do-do-do.  White guys are like that.  Do-ho-ho.  But you-  Really?  White guys are really-  Are they?  They're pee whipped jerks.  Is that it?  I travel all around this country and you just go, are you really, are you that serious? 
[01:41:30]  That's why you kill your women.  Because-  We kill our women.  White guys-  We kill our women.  You throw your women in lakes and kill them because you don't know, you get, you build  up to this point where, you know, white women, like in Ray Romano, except for Ray Romano's  case, it's perfect in, everybody loves Raymond.  Yeah.  His wife treats him like garbage.  Right.  And he goes, yes, dear, yes, dear, yes, dear.  But in real world, you, yes, dear, until you go, until you cheat on her, meet the other 
[01:42:00]  woman and want to get rid of your wife and you kill her.  That is a white thing to do.  I'll give you that.  Let's talk about what black people do.  What do we do?  We can't say it because we get fired.  We don't kill our wives.  No.  And white, see, black people will do, a black person will do one thing and it will represent  our entire history.  Like that's what we always did.  We do not have a history of tossing, look at this, look at this damn cop who kills 
[01:42:30]  his women.  What's his name?  Peterson.  Yeah.  He just goes, I'm tired of this bitch.  Off with a head.  He's like King, he's like Henry Day.  Come on.  White guys have a history of killing their wives when they feel like it.  Black guys don't kill their wives and they'll go, what about OJ?  Exactly.  Keep, keep saying OJ to the end of the world, but before OJ, who was the reference and after  OJ, who's the reference, it's Juice.  He killed his white wife.  But there's certainly white crime and black crime. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Most of the serial killers are white.  Most of the worst crimes are white, but we're, oh, and you guys are, why are, how  come I'm not free?  Black people are, we have quality crimes.  You make it up in quantity.  I'm.  I'm.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  The stop brain is rolling.  I'm glad I got back in time for that smashing.  We deal in quality. 
[01:43:30]  We do a lot of, a lot of stuff.  Yeah.  White people do some really great.  I think black people are more impulsive  and white people are more  let me plan this out  I gotta get the boat on Christmas Eve  it's a lot more prestigious  well yeah  there's like more of a story that goes to it  like Scott Peterson  it's Christmas Eve, the pregnant wife  I gotta get some duct tape, I gotta get some rope  and black guys are like  my bitch was just effing this guy 
[01:44:00]  boom  in the head and you end up in prison for  life  and meanwhile the white guy's like  I'm searching for her  I'm gonna help in the search to find my wife  Scott Peterson is in jail for life  oh I know  most of the time you get caught  yeah because we overthink it  we're like who's gonna believe that I killed my pregnant wife  on Christmas Eve  it's the first thing people think when you say the wife's missing  and the husband said she went jogging  earlier  I just instantly go the guy did it 
[01:44:30]  he's guilty, lock him up  they overthink the whole thing  they come up with like a scenario where no way would anyone believe this  yeah  but it's very believable  these guys are more impulsive  someone steps on a toe  they get shot  I'm just saying to go back to the Obama thing  strong black dudes are not represented ever  well somebody said I was  oh they're gone  what about Styx from Happy Days  I'm wrong about Goldie  Styx  Styx is a porn star 
[01:45:00]  oh there he is  had a fine black role in Happy Days  of course Styx  Styx the kidnapper  I want to hear from  Zoe from Harlem over there  who said I'm wrong  about Goldie Wilson  well you're not gonna hear from it  that's I got to  no  come on  I have to  because I know I'm not wrong  because I know he's gonna  I know what he's gonna say  no it's funny about you too  I'm like  I'm like the  I don't know  I'm like a referee or something  it's an observation though  I was percolating really bad 
[01:45:30]  as we came back from break  and I  I ran to the bathroom  it took literally  two seconds  from me leaving the chair  and being out of this situation  for you guys to go black versus white  I was like  you gotta be kidding me  it's like  every show is like  Geraldo with us  you gotta put a chair  across my face  but right now  look  I just  hold on  let's go to Zoe  alright let's go to Zoe  Zoe in Harlem  Zoe  good morning

[01:46:30]  the whole back to the future thing  uh  I don't think he was a horrible mayor  I think it's when  McFly was back  to the future  he did something wrong  no see  no no  I'm talking the first one  where he just comes back  and he ends up  right there on Main Street  and  there's a porno theater  and a homeless guy  sleeping on the bench  and there's newspapers  all over  there's a helicopter  with a searchlight  flying over uh  uh  the clock tower  can I ask one quick question 
[01:47:00]  yes  was  did the movie  mmhmm  imply that it was his fault  that it was the black man's fault  for the town  being like  not at all  not at all  but I'm like  the town was fine  yeah  it was beautiful  and then  uh  Mayor Goldie Wilson  steps in  and the town sucks  yeah  Patrice has a white guy  you just know  you just know  Mayor Goldie Wilson  was corrupt  he was  he was taking money  and when you were describing  that scene from  Back to the Future  I really thought  you were describing 
[01:47:30]  uh  the Dinkins administration  yeah  Mayor Goldie Dinkins  but you know  a lot of people like to go  well look what happened  in New York City  when Dinkins was mayor  you know  the economy also was  pretty effing bad  oh Dinkins was the worst mayor  though  come on  and it was all his fault  but what happened  what happened to the fact  that he took over for Koch  what happened to that theory  that he had to deal  with Koch's nonsense  well he did for a little while  but Koch  you know  Koch was there during some  he took bad  and made it worse  is what you're saying  but Koch had to make up  for like a bean 
[01:48:00]  and the city was completely  broke at that point  so Koch actually got the city  back on his feet  but he wasn't tough on crime  the first one that was  tough on crime  and cleaning up the city  was Giuliani  he's the first mayor  that came in  and actually  kind of you know  dealt with that situation  made the combat zone  into Disneyland  yeah  brought a lot of money  into New York City  sorry the whole  you know  culture thing  is  of  smut  and murder  is gone  from Times Square

[01:54:00]  a pinata  when the train  comes  also in  Massachusetts  there was  an accident  on route  128 north  in Danvers  after a car  driving the  wrong way  caused a  series of  accidents  a serious  accident  I meant to  say  on the  scene  one of the  victims was  asked what  happened  but his  response was  unintelligible  due to having  pieces of  radiator  stuck in his  gums  no reports 
[01:54:30]  so far  had been  confirmed  that the  driver was  intoxicated  or at least  mildly retarded  or maybe a  relative of  mine  who knows  a little  ad lib  yeah  radiated  stuck in  his gums  yeah  yeah  yeah  I like  this  yeah  here's one  of my  favorites  okay  there's a  motorcycle  accident  and the  driver skidded  for a quarter  mile  don't you  love people  with road  rash 
[01:55:00]  don't they  look purdy  I hope  all his  skin got  peeled off  and then  the people  who were  inconvenienced  by the  traffic  backup  should just  throw things  at him  and then  any bone  that wasn't  broken  should be  snapped in  half by  tie irons  and before  the guy  goes into  shock  and becomes  unconscious  hopefully  he will be  able to enjoy  being set on  fire  I didn't  realize the  death song  was so  long  yeah

[02:26:30]  nothing for me i don't like stairway to heaven nothing it's a riding black dog is a better song  to me than that but as a black guy it's like some of the white guy songs i like will be almost like  if a white person goes oh man that song getting jiggy with it with will smith oh yeah yeah that's a  great rap song right i'm gonna shut the fuck up no we're not we're not that stupid so eagles like  they're like hotel california to a big time like a legitimate white guy might be a just a cornball  thing to say as a black guy uh eagle you know hotel california is pretty like fucking pretty good

[02:28:30]  fucking lick you like a lollipop shit it's trying too hard this shit was like somebody came out from  a from a hole in the ground that had been doing something that we never heard and then when this  came out you was like holy shit what is this just like nwa uh straight out of compton you go what the  fuck oh yeah these niggas are from another planet that shit was some hardcore stuff and to this day  it's not even the hardcoreness it's the it's the legitimate righteousness of it this song is 
[02:29:00]  righteous man this is when rap was righteous this shit is not trying to make money this shit what this  shit is genius listen to this fucking song you can't do nothing oh some MCs perpetrating a fraud  nigga's like what the fuck are they saying perpetrating a fraud you can do anything that you want to but you can't leave until it through you relax your body and your mind and listen to us sing this rhyme hey you might think that you have waited long enough till the rhyme was stated 
[02:29:30]  lucky gifts would be graded damn not debated and not think this and all our rhymes make a lot of sense so shake your butt to the cut this is awful but it's beautiful  if a motherfucker rap like this now i think black people are from mars  really i i i don't get it on any level i'm sorry side to side back and forth with two MCs and we're gonna go 
[02:30:00]  all stand in place walk or run this is the this could be the greatest song that ever was made keep  singing patrice like the riff i'm dj's better than all these fans  i'm digging the fucking rock riff there it's a beautiful when i first heard this i got emotional  if i could have cried you don't know how to cry though if i could have cried at a song 
[02:30:30]  it would have been when i heard this that's how great this song is  all right uh because calvin klein no friend of mine don't want nobody's name on my behind  well that's a white thing oh yeah sneakers on my feet jay by my side yeah but that the calvin  klein that's a white thing that's white world not really because calvin klein was big with black  people back then calvin's was huge with blacks jordash calvin's absolutely okay sergio valente i don't 
[02:31:00]  even know you remember those bands so what the fuck are they gonna wear then if they don't have  the calvin's levi's because you really can't there's no name on levi's even though it is a name  it's levi it's levi but calvin klein is like you associate that with a dude and levi was like a  redneck why would you wear his jeans who the fuck knows i mean you can make hypocrites out of anybody  but i know what they i get it i think levi was way more racist than calvin klein  i don't know  i think calvin klein was a sissy too i think we do a little wikipedia on levi jeans you're gonna find 
[02:31:30]  some scary stuff in there  i think levi is short for levington all right hold on we got louis the great louis ck oh oh sorry i said  the great patrice o'neill earlier i saw louis uh new hour at caroline's over the weekend fantastic  job lou oh thanks man fantastic job yeah right thank you you like lollipop by little wayne i 
[02:32:00]  listen to it very loud on my speakers in my car all the time but you're white i know well so i love it  i just i it's i guess it's a guilty pleasure whatever but i turn it up really loud it's the  kind of song you need to listen to in a car where the mirrors are shaped like vibrating from the  music and everything yeah i just really like it it's uh it's it's in the pop category i i don't mind a  good pop song every once in a while no that's that's what the last one i liked this way was uh 
[02:32:30]  believe by share that's the last song that i like oh jeez you're a  that's a little that's a little gayish oh well totally it's so little wayne's song i mean it's  all gay i i don't think hardcore black guys are like you know cranking up uh this lollipop song  right patrice is more like a girly song i'm thinking i don't know but it's a pimp song it's  that pimp it's that it's that thing where black guys that are pimps and they get furry and they start 
[02:33:00]  getting peacock ish and then they become women yeah well i got something for you low yeah  do you believe in all that's love yeah awesome louis said oh he's gonna call  he's whacking his bag right now oh  you gotta listen to this when you're running you gotta go running with this on your uh on your  on your ipod the believe all right away from gay people what are you running from well the one i 
[02:33:30]  mean if louis can admit i'll admit the one that gets me is a madonna song which one ray of light  oh yeah i like that i like running all right oh ray of light ray of light makes you run a little  little faster a little harder if you're working out yes yes no in little pink shorts definitely  yeah you dick no i'm saying it's awesome with the pink shorts i'm not making funny you like pink  shorts well when i'm running to listen how could you not like this as far as pop songs go uh not 
[02:34:00]  everything has to be a guitar riff no it doesn't okay i mean i i don't i don't search out madonna  songs but if you're exposed to a song like this you know i'm like yeah she is cool wait she's singing  now well let her start let her get into it a little bit oh yeah you're just warming up on the  treadmill right now give madonna a second yeah give her time man she's we're revving up man we're  going to a higher level here i don't think so yes i think this is uh a girl's song wait when she 
[02:34:30]  screams and i feel you know what the you know what this looks like when she does it live  you know what that's i'm sorry that's all i can fucking say  this was inspirational this horse shit oh yeah it's if if she's doing this live yeah you are just 
[02:35:00]  seeing gay men jumping around to this with you know what also with magical blinking lights with a  lot of extra horse shit right that's what he's got the backpacks on and stuff yeah because the  rhymes i say sharp as a nail witty is can be enough for sale all right and that's all you got to do is  see two niggas with adidas and i still want to be run dmc if i could be i would this hat is a 
[02:35:30]  dedication to them man it certainly is like isn't there motherfuckers you love like that you don't  love this bitch i don't know hold on here it comes again come on love  oh  yeah see i'm getting awesome from low he knows he knows  not all the point to that music is it's all produced music and if you listen to those three  songs by the way lollipop that one yeah and believe they're probably the same producer 
[02:36:00]  hey totally gay yeah hello you like that don't you faggot well now i'm not with you i can i can  squeeze one of these songs on my ipod not all three because i wish i knew how to quit you  i might be able to squeeze this in between some cool like white boy rock music but not all three  man oh no but i mean they're all the same it's basically whatever whoever that producer works for  gets the hit like whoever gets you know it doesn't matter i mean this is all shitty music but i  really makes my body feel good because i think my body you really like lollipop uh louis lollipop i 
[02:36:30]  can crank it all the time so that's fair because i think i like some shitty songs probably but but  anthony's not innocent here come on ant what you listen to some weird stuff too man uh weird not  fruity like that like gunfire and give us wind the moon hit your eye like a big pizza pie i'm not  really a dean martin fan here we go again lou oh yeah oh yeah yeah just get fucked in the ass 
[02:37:00]  this is yes oh this just brings white people back when they lived in outer space i love i love  lou in the background awesome awesome i love madonna hey lou listen any group what what group do you  love like you go i love these motherfuckers as just i love them i have old i like i led zeppelin 
[02:37:30]  like you love now number one you love i love run dmc and then there's some other ones i love but if  you go you you get a choice to keep keep a music group alive number one for me is zeppelin you to  keep everyone oh my god that one is huge number one the beatles are huge for me led zeppelin's huge  i love the beatles myself but number one you get you go this this survives zeppelin timeless i  it's hard just that's really timeless it's definitely overplayed not just not that easy 
[02:38:00]  no the songs they play on the radio overplayed so overplayed that one has a whole catalog that  could hit the radio airwaves tomorrow and do extremely well and also it depends on like i  just uh i just got this uh marvin gaye cd and i can't stop listening to that which one what song  low uh what's going on the whole album it's one song fades into the next and it's phenomenally  good hippie it's better than anything right now that the marvin gaye would really argue that one 
[02:38:30]  man marvin gaye was competes competes with led zeppelin probably yeah definitely  anything any best black art artistic anything probably beats any artistic white anything really  yeah i'll tell you what very bold statement certainly is hey i want to uh thank billy boston uh  yes i'll tell you a rap song that i couldn't get enough of 99 problems but the bitch ain't one of  course because it's just but that shit was out it was wrong with that nothing wrong with it in  that song it's nothing wrong with you like but you liked it i'm not gonna search out black songs in 
[02:39:00]  general black people love that song like that that's what i i like i'm into that song but you're into  it for just because white people are fascinated with pimping no dude it's it's fascinated with that  that's it it's the beat of this song and that bass line is amazing but rock boxes rock box dryer sheet  in my shirt oh you better you better can i just say one thing about lollipop yeah you guys were trying 
[02:39:30]  to figure out i mean the rapper thing is really simple it's just the letter lick the rapper like if  you've got a lollipop it's got a rapper on it all right so he's talking about a condom no he's saying  that he's saying the the dub in the double entendre the first entendre is the rapper that you put on a  lollipop right she wants to lick the rapper like it's like he's giving her scraps and then the other  side of it is rapper with an starting with an r yeah if he is a rapper that makes sense she's like 
[02:40:00]  fooling around with the rapper a little bit could be the pants could be the fly like the rapper or he's  just a stupid black guy who's making up stupid words that's a very bold statement there's bluey  you can say that he's mexican no i've been saying he's stupid and he happens to also be black  i like there's an apology coming do you have black friends louie i'm sorry i said that yeah 
[02:40:30]  hey uh hello did you hear the shack freestyle thing the what shack freestyling about kobe  what did shack say about kobe oh she got the uncensored version we got to play it it's quick  so stay on the line and uh all right we had a lot of fun with this this morning figuring out uh  shack came up with the best riff ever it's gonna be all over the radio in the next couple of weeks  someone's gonna do something with this here it is it ain't about that it's about big a.k.a big shack 
[02:41:00]  now that's the difference between first and last place kobe tell me how my ass tastes  okay kobe tell me how my ass tastes  okay everybody kobe tell me how my ass tastes  kobe you can't do it without me kobe you can't do it without me 
[02:41:30]  everybody kobe tell me how my ass tastes yeah you can't do it without me yeah you can't do it  without me yeah you can't do it without me everybody kobe yeah 
[02:42:00]  he got the crowd going what do you think kobe how do my how do my ass taste yeah he's saying how's my  ass taste yeah and we were trying to figure out what that means and i think we finally got it  well he's saying first he's saying tell me how my ass tastes yeah right yeah which i think is  like to me poetry is something that brings an image to your mind very vividly yeah and so i  immediately see giant shack with his shorts down his ankles and kobe just fucking munching his 
[02:42:30]  asshole and then shack looking back and going tell me which is a really funny impulse while somebody's  eating your ass look back and go tell me how my ass tastes  that really is like an inappropriate thing to say as that's going on yeah like looking back at the  way hey tell me how my ass tastes like it's the ultimate narcissism that you want someone to eat  your ass you know i want to know how that tastes and kobe then's gotta like pull his head back and  just go oh no it's good it's good you gotta look around the corner of his ass yeah yeah and then get 
[02:43:00]  back to it i i i went with this you know he's basically saying he's a better basketball player  than kobe so shack is dunking the ball and kobe's helpless and now his ass is at uh mouth level as  kobe watches the dunk go down i think that's probably what that means uh yeah ah but patrice came up with  it it has something to do well it was the guy malik he he he he invade he invest from asbury park 
[02:43:30]  yes yes he what he what he was saying louis was he fucked kobe's wife uh-huh and when kobe kisses  his wife he's saying he tastes shack's ass tell me how my ass tastes because kobe's wife ate shack's  ass according to malik from asbury park that gives me another great uh visual which is not  the woman like i don't see shack laying on his stomach with the woman eating his asshole yeah  i see him just sitting on a woman's head uh with his naked and so you just see her from the neck down 
[02:44:00]  just coming out of his ass until she's until she's unconscious then kobe comes yeah and he kisses her  and he tastes his ass yeah well we think that's going to be a huge hit they're going to take that  shack riff and make something into it make something i want to know how his ass tastes oh now you gotta  wonder i bet it's not very tasty i don't think i want to know how my ass tastes now 
[02:44:30]  because that's the impulse there is like you can't taste your own ass like i could actually  find out what shack's ass tastes like well we do taste your people's ass because you keep shitting  in the spinach and the tomatoes so tell your people to stop shitting in our food so we won't know what  that's it hey tell me how my ass tastes our shit doesn't taste like our ass  tell me how my shit tastes i will when i get out the hospital for salmonella you motherfuckers oh 
[02:45:00]  fuck man damn so still better than you you'd fucking get a little too real now man  oh it all just comes out man that was like like the untouchables still better than you you stuck  irish just uh just a lot of brown people fighting for the scraps that's all we are you know what 
[02:45:30]  made me laugh all day yesterday was uh our discussion on the special place how girls will  say they're saving oh they're saving their ass for marriage i heard that that's amazing it's like  that the fuck but then when you really break it down you're like what the fuck is special about  that that's what they should be giving up before marriage and then first thing should be that  fucking stinky god damn sewer yeah women should be giving up the stink hole right the the whole  where miracles happen where where two cells divide and life begins yeah that's that to her that's like 
[02:46:00]  a fucking taco bell drive-through yeah right through there but but the place where shit and  fucking diarrhea and uh fucking eight year old eight day old guys come that slithered back out  that that's that's fucking that she's saving that that's got a little blue ribbon on it that's the  magic fucking prize yeah that's where that's wrap it up where the guys really want to be right there 
[02:46:30]  yeah that's where she's got a little blue ribbon and a palm written in in script you know by  and all that calligraphy i'm saving my shithole for my husband yeah  we finally broke it down yesterday we finally broke it down yesterday we're like what the  fuck yeah i'm saving that for this stupid special place ain't the prize about it this hole that has  shot out like gobs of diarrhea after a bad meal i'm saving that for the man i that i love who i 
[02:47:00]  haven't yet met who i'm going to love yeah yeah oh i don't get it oh my god that pristine place  fucking stupid that woman was i hated her  i was driving around yelling at my fucking radio when she was on i hated her which one the woman  who you're talking to at that moment that called in the fucking drunk oh the drunk yeah i hated her  fucking annoying it looked like she had a little coke habit and i can't believe how patient you guys are 
[02:47:30]  with uh people like that i just wanted to fucking find her i want you to keep her on the phone so we  could get a trace on her and i could go to her house and beat her to death yeah we were trying  to get into our head a little bit like what the fuck yeah didn't pan out no that one didn't pan  out you know that may be the the one kind of person in the world where there would be no benefit  finding out what she what what makes her tick yeah good point good you know yeah you know like  whatever like hitler or the terrorists we really it'd be really good to know what those people are like 
[02:48:00]  so we can well but but she there's nothing to get we're learning about hitler today we're finding  out he had a sense of humor man he's a funny guy that hitler was a funny guy we got uh two big  comedians uh one on the phone and one in studio what he used to joke being a funny guy he used to  make jokes about uh all of his uh how does his subordinates yeah he was like uh bush like how he had  nicknames for his uh people and stuff yeah yeah no hitler uh hitler what i heard is that hitler uh 
[02:48:30]  when he saw a chaplain he loved charlie chaplin and when charlie chaplin made the great dictator  it broke hitler's heart like it really hurt his feelings oh poor hitler i know like you didn't have  poor hitler at first he was like look at this motherfucker with my mustache yeah he's  thank you for that wait i think he's making fun of me this motherfucker poor hitler yeah you know  hitler took time out from running nazi germany to make jokes at the expense of his henchmen a new  book claims his favorite uh victim was luftwaffe chief luftwaffe i know chief heinrich heinrich 
[02:49:00]  himmler uh herman that was uh herman goering right who was notoriously fond of awarding himself  medals and decorations according to the book by the last surviving member of his bunker hitler  recounted how miss gang found her husband waving a baton over his underwear in the bedroom and asked  him what he was doing he replied i'm promoting my underpants to overpants hitler oh that hitler 
[02:49:30]  hitler then joked hitler's hysterical underpants he's promoting him to overpants i sound like he wrote  for hogan's hero hitler said to be so proud of his joke that he made medals made from gold and  silver paper for getting to wear on his pajamas i wonder where the gold and silver came from how did  a motherfucker that tried to kill an entire race have a sense of humor ever he's a funny guy let's 
[02:50:00]  just listen to that joke what's not funny about killing all the jews oh my god jesus louis i mean  it was not funny about how the fuck do you do that another on another occasion he noticed his  official photographer hen henrich hoffman had drunk too much and told him don't stand too near the fire  you might burst into flames oh my god because he drank so much and you know that he got a huge  laugh for those jokes oh my god who was not laughing at hitler's shit and then after the heckles hitler 
[02:50:30]  the laugh died down you know everybody ha ha and he go okay go go put some more people in a gas  chamber oh yeah like you motherfucker like what's wrong with you it was a break in the action a couple  jokes all right but now we gotta get back to work back to business the book is called the last witness  it's gonna be published in britain uh later this year oh who's not who's not making jokes who everybody  laughs at everything you say i mean that's just too tempting to have an audience that oh yeah he makes a  joke nobody goes ah not not that funny buddy yeah no no one does no there's two kinds of people that 
[02:51:00]  get laughs whatever they say there's dictators and astronauts always get laughs yeah true when you're in  space and you make the slightest joke like you go hey uh i can see yankee stadium somebody get me a hot  dog and the whole controller just dies laughing yeah because they can die at any moment yeah try making  that joke it's the fucking water cooler hey somebody give me a hot dog yeah they'll punch in the 
[02:51:30]  face shut up yeah go fucking uh downstairs you faggot and they throw them out the window yeah i know  we're all over the place but uh something else we were going to bring up here in new york  chase stadium is closing down so i guess is it the last what uh subway series yes the last subway  series can we get that commercial still you think they they had dramatic music basically encouraging  people to to come out to shea stadium before they knock that shithole down excuse me like there's 
[02:52:00]  something important there that's the cw 11 that is running that uh fucking promotion and uh i do believe  i will be joining uh jill at an event where we will be uh uh celebrating the um the closing of that  shithole yeah yeah it's called shea stadium uh well the last game of the uh subway series kind of  thing yeah it's the last subway series before the first one of next season it's a different stadium  yeah exactly thank you uck is setting us right it's like yeah i mean this is hardcore met fans that 
[02:52:30]  listen to us no one is sitting there crying because shea stadium's being uh torn down come and help us  uh celebrate uh celebrate the last june 24th right 2008 ever no one would be accurate if they went on  and said look uh you you got your last uh chance to take a shit in the stands at shea stadium before  they knock this shit hole down yeah place stinks it always sucked 
[02:53:00]  always what's it going to be called now it's going to be called uh much better than shea stadium  stadium washington mutual bank of america some shit what is it they painted blue and orange like  it's going to be called city field it's going to be called thank god we got rid of that shithole  stadium stadium and i'm sure it's spelled c-i-t-i field yeah city bank yeah but they're dramatic 
[02:53:30]  like it's it's it you know make sure you come out they had the dramatic like someone had cancer  music and kenny my favorite kenny joke what i took my girlfriend to a french restaurant last  night shea stadium oh god fucking kenny he actually said but he was proud too oh he was he had a big  smile like look at everyone laughing just about everybody listening to us would say that as like  obviously this is really hacky and awful not kenny he was so proud hitler wouldn't have gotten a laugh 
[02:54:00]  with that one no yeah there you go and uh by the way shack lost his deputy badge for doing that  uh freestyle rap about uh kobe and i think the reason was because he used the n-word  yeah the black guy using the n-word and they're taking his badge away from him look at this  fucking asshole talking about shack yeah are we gonna get the commercial before  fucking dumb all right louie hang on for a second because you got to hear how dramatic they're making  this last subway series here in new york all right where are you off to by the way what's that where

[02:57:30]  fucking skinny dipping with 20 year olds with that were the kalua they were the kalua girls that would  go around the bar with the kalua and wearing the like kalua fucking skirts and things and they  wanted to go out and yeah just go fucking get naked with us and shit and anthony i both gotta go home we  we we had cartoon voices no no no i should have just called up the wife and said look i'm naked  swimming with fucking we should have taken kalua girls we should have taken patrice's advice from 
[02:58:00]  yesterday what would you do if a really hot girl comes along you would smother not a really hot girl  that particular bitch you showed all right i would have smothered my girl with a pillow  the fuck that bitch that's what we should have told uh the girls at the time ant would you  yeah  would you fuck the dead would you fuck your dead girlfriend we would after you smother her and  then go fuck the girl we would that's what she wanted we would have told the skinny dipping broads  yeah we'll be right back you gotta give us about 45 minutes and they would say why and we would  both say because we're going home to smother our girls so we could be with you would y'all 
[02:58:30]  had a done even if you were free to get that pussy i it's some the the thing i get from you guys is  that you wouldn't have anyway it's kind of like you it's good you was in a relationship because i  don't see either one of you really dude we were fucking those bitches if you even if you had a chance  we were faithful guys imagine what a great news story that would have been a chance uh both both  wives of shock jocks well i wasn't married well i don't want to make that  yeah i hope he wasn't married but you was in one of those relationships though right i guess 
[02:59:00]  i guess it's like i don't see it as the relationship got worse i think you know you're  not doing viagra are you you still it's still working i don't know i've got so much pent-up come  i need no viagra oh have you have you done a threesome yet the first girl that i uh fucked since uh  uh when we got um divorced oh man uh it was uh i fucked her like six times one night it was crazy  oh my god how old was she louis non-stop 27 uh it's but so young but still look like a woman woman 
[02:59:30]  louis found like louis found like coke penis but that's what it is because he didn't get he didn't  get the pussy in his formative pussy years he was he was being faithful in half of those and the other  half he wasn't getting it now fucking you should he's getting you that should still be on tv pussy  yeah god damn i remember when i one uh night at the virus tour i think it was the philly show 
[03:00:00]  uh one of the strippers what was uh really really talking to me a lot and then she came into my  dressing room with me said can i come with you to your dressing room and i was like okay and i was  married and my heart was pounding was you trembling he was trembling like god no no i was like i'm not  gonna cheat with this woman but i do want her to be in my dressing room she came she came in my  dressing room we were both standing there i would feel really awkward i wasn't sure what was gonna  happen and then this some chaperone woman some fifties you know leathery skin woman 
[03:00:30]  fucking threw the door open and went to the girl get out out oh really there's some girl some  woman that travels with them that keeps them from uh from the town can i ask everybody a dude  question there's a dude question what if can you and i'm being real hypothetical can you tell  your wife or your ex-girlfriend your ex-wife or your ex-girlfriend that i cheated on you when we  were together what would be the point of that i'm saying can you is that i think is that a bad thing 
[03:01:00]  to do like if you go ah yeah depends on how the relationship went if you want to rub it in her  fucking face if she's a bitch then i'm with louie you tell her i'm with louie what's the you make  shit up i'm just curious just to rub it in patrice why would you say tell that woman anything about  anything right that means you care still okay let me let me change it because that was a goofy  question let me say all right listening to the story you you just said my mind was going in so i guess 
[03:01:30]  you made sense when you did that now let me try to fix it yeah say you fuck that stripper in the  story yeah for the sake of telling that story and you fuck the stripper are you allowed to say it  after you get divorced that story or do you keep that story i didn't fuck that stripper  hypothetically you keep that story i i didn't fuck that stripper until the lawyers do what they have to 
[03:02:00]  do exactly that's that's a better way to put it because i think the way y'all said it was right  you don't and by the way we're you don't want to set them on fire man you don't want to get them  going by the way you were a saint when you were married yeah we're still in the process of this  divorce so do me a favor don't don't tell anybody that i've been fucking any uh women yeah i know  oh no of course not don't worry let's just put it this way louie louie has so much cum flowing  through his body at this point that the price of cum has dropped for all of us thank you  oh no the the levy thank you i'm i'm drinking your milkshake and coming it into your mom's

[03:07:00]  motherfuckers who just arbitrarily will kill a motherfucker yeah because he's there but somebody  who does something for crimes of passion you shouldn't go to jail for fucking yeah now did  you hear about did you hear about the black y'all talk you had to talk about this the the black the  woman the black woman that's going to jail for um she was cheating on her husband and and he called  her like 20 times and then and what happened is i hear i can't hear i can't hear shit  you know we like the noise from the guy no if you do keep it open no no it's fine go ahead but the 
[03:07:30]  but the um the lady was cheating on on the husband and um he called her like 19 times or some  shit he was getting reached so he goes home to you know he was concerned about evidently oh she he  catches her she's fucking in a truck but the bitch sees the husband coming as she's fucking sees him  but the guy fucking her doesn't see and she just starts screaming rape holy that the guy she's 
[03:08:00]  cheating with is raping her at the time help oh god lord and then the husband kills him no  shit for raping his wife of course and then um but she ends up going to jail for the whole thing  because yeah because of that you know that situation did he go to jail at all no the guy didn't go to  jail wow that's a fucked up case but that passion let's say the guy did go to jail that passion when 
[03:08:30]  you're in in that kind of fit even if you catch them cheating and she doesn't yell rape you don't  go to jail for the rest of your fucking life for that moment four years is enough yep four years is  enough for me to go four years just it's a a presidential term just enough that's enough  to not send me to jail for the rest of my fucking life you go to jail for one olympic you're supposed  to be able to hold your shit together as this guy in those circumstances i know i know i don't 
[03:09:00]  believe me you come on mr gunman and somebody's pounding your woman that you love  mm-hmm some of us can hold our shit together but the fact is not many though holy shit this  guy's pounding my wife and you know to dies women are objects so really what you're doing is you're  banging my good watch against the the floor like i come i come home and you're slamming my rolex  against the floor and you won't stop so i'm gonna fucking shoot you as some bigger dick guy is 
[03:09:30]  pounding your woman you you you got a gun you shoot you shouldn't go to jail for the rest of your  goddamn life you think that well i as a punishment four years in prison is enough  i don't know that's uh you you again you bring up a great point uh and i think they are a lot more  lenient on crimes of passion than they are you know with uh not even 20 years not even 20 years 
[03:10:00]  that's a long time it is a long time imagine if you went to jail 20 years ago but then you got  fucking i know right if you went to jail about that sometimes in 1988 you're getting out today  like think of what i was doing in 88 and then that's when they slammed the door shut and you're  just getting out almost 85 you can say you went to jail in 85 you're getting out in 2005 back to the  future's out you get out in 2005 because you caught somebody fucking your girl i missed two and three  and you shot him you shot you're in like you're you're a poly that's your punishment so you have 
[03:10:30]  to think about what you've done you have to be a a pillar of society when you get out really when  you go to jail they it teaches you how to be a better criminal you're living with criminals it's  not rehabilitation it's fucking punishment you've fucking killed someone you shouldn't have to leave  society for fucking that long because that person who you killed has a family and they want to see you  you fucking dead never mind they don't want to see you out in fucking three years they want to see  you dead you see lock up on msnbc oh i watch that i love that 62 year old motherfucker some real did

[03:37:00]  well i would be in the bathtub or in the you know whatever and he would just walk in nonchalantly uh  shave or do something and walk out you know and you would be naked in the bathtub yeah and then i would  say i'm embarrassed and he said you're just a little girl and that was it do you understand what  a creep this guy was we're getting well he was in his 60s he was decent he was respected by the  church respected by the church you're insane this guy was getting off patty got gots there's no 
[03:37:30]  reason for that guy to be in there shaving while you're in the bathtub and he would try to cover  himself up i mean if i tried to close the door it wasn't nobody was allowed to close doors in that  house 15 let me ask you a question now 15 year old cooch full-blown bush by this time right of  course so you're just sitting there with your bush in the tub i didn't have much of one at that age  it was a like a 50s bush oh i'm sure that it was floating at the top yeah it looked like a little
