<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Sammy (pre-show context) present and the hosts discussing their personal experiences. Opie recounted his return to comfortable sweatpants after a weekend, while Anthony detailed a frustrating commute caused by a Grand Central Parkway accident, criticizing the road's design and the general aggressive driving in New York City. He also described a significant traffic delay caused by an overturned pineapple truck on the Staten Island Expressway.  Anthony then excitedly recounted a winning blackjack streak in Atlantic City, accompanied by a police officer named Keith and members of Blue Oyster Cult. This led to a discussion about the band and high-stakes gambling.

The show continued with a discussion of recent apologies from Justin Bieber (for a resurfaced racist joke) and Jack White (for comments about the Black Keys and his ex-wife, Meg White, in a Rolling Stone interview). This sparked tangents about Blue Oyster Cult, the Black Keys, and the death of Alice Ghostley from *The Brady Bunch*.  The hosts speculated about the divorced ex-wife of Peter Brady, and the perceived importance of high-fives,  reading a listener tweet highlighting confusion between The White Stripes and The Black Keys.

Next, the hosts reviewed the movie *Chef*, surprisingly praising its quality despite a negative initial impression from the trailer.  A significant portion of the show was then dedicated to a cooking segment featuring Guy Fieri, who appeared in-studio to prepare and discuss his "Danger Dogs" (bacon-wrapped hot dogs) and his Miller Lite collaboration.  This segment included considerable banter and crude humor.  The Stanley Cup Playoffs were also discussed, featuring debate between the hosts and a caller about the Kings and Rangers hockey teams, with a mention of regular listener Roland in a Rangers jersey.  A prank call to Greg Brady during a live TV interview about Ann B. Davis' death was also brainstormed.

The tragic news of Ann B. Davis's death was announced, prompting a discussion and the playing of audio clips from Casey Kasem’s family’s contentious legal battle, revealing highly emotional and upsetting audio of Kasem’s distressed reaction.  This was followed by another discussion of Justin Bieber's past offensive comments and his apology. The show then touched upon a New York Times article on workplace dissatisfaction, a photographer's extreme selfie, and continued with listener calls and more banter.  Barry Williams (Greg Brady) called in multiple times throughout the show, initially with pre-recorded commentary on Ann B. Davis’ death and later in a live interview interspersed with humorous missed calls and a text message from Williams reading, "Alice is dead."  Further discussion covered Williams' Branson, Missouri show ("70s Music Celebration"), and more varied tangents.


A caller then described a chaotic hip-hop concert experience, painting a vivid picture of a parking lot riot with overflowing alcohol, broken grill parts, fights, and unchecked access to backstage areas.  The caller used highly offensive and derogatory language to describe the attendees' behavior, comparing the scene to a "ghetto prom."  The conversation then shifted to a humorous anecdote about the caller's son's inappropriate comments about penis size in a restaurant bathroom, leading to a discussion on children's candidness about bodily functions. Barry Williams then delivered a self-composed rap song referencing his television career and personal life.  A call about a bizarre encounter with a large, unlit object near the Statue of Liberty (later revealed to be a mooring buoy) was recounted. The show concluded with a discussion of Arsenio Hall’s failed comeback, the success of other late-night hosts, and a comparison of the careers of rock stars' and athletes' children, featuring discussions of Phil Collins performing with a middle school band and Sting's son’s band, Friction Plane.  A final discussion about pizza-making on Rachel Ray's show concluded this segment.

The final segment began with a discussion of a listener's negative experience at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant due to small portion sizes. A CNN news report showing a CNN correspondent's arrest by Turkish police while reporting live was shown, followed by a discussion about various methods of reheating leftover pizza (with a strong dislike expressed for microwaving). Finally, the hosts criticized the appearances of *Today* show hosts Hoda Kotb and Kathy Lee Gifford.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  ...of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah!  Here we are.  Yay!  Where we are.  Back on the radio.  Doot, doot, doot.  Ah, good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Good job at the pre-show, Sammy.  Sammy!  Ah!  I got breaking news. Can I start with breaking news?  Ooh! 
[00:00:30]  Return to the sweatpants!  Oh, shit.  See how I pushed my hips forward?  I saw that, unfortunately.  Did you get a little look at the juice?  Any juice in there? Are you juicing?  I'm back to sweatpants, motherfucker.  It's Friday. It's, uh, it's, uh,  it's Friday.  It's summer.  Yes.  Summer in the city.  The sweatpants are in full fucking form.  Brand new sweatpants, though. 
[00:01:00]  Brand new?  Not, uh, not sweatpants where the crotch is blown out,  where a manager has to tell me to pull them up.  How, so how long do a new pair of sweatpants,  is that a seasonal thing?  By, by fall do you retire them?  Oh, hell no.  No?  You hold on to them for quite some time?  First brand new sweatpants in, I would say, three years.  Oh, Jesus.  At least three years.  I wear my shit out.  Anyway, it's Monday.  Fuck!  Yeah, that is a rough one.  Not, not for us.  We have easy lives. 
[00:01:30]  I'm, that was for you.  Fuck!  Well, it's the getting up part kind of sucks there, too, but.  Yeah.  You know.  Although I went to bed early, so my, my body clock goes,  well, you went to bed early, well, we're gonna get you up early.  Yeah.  What is that about?  I was exhausted.  I had a long, long, fun weekend, so I went to bed early.  Yeah.  I'm up at four.  I don't have to be up at four.  No.  Wide awake.  Keep sleeping.  Wide awake.  Yeah, why not?  What are you doing?  Why not?  Yeah.  Who just wrote me?  Hold on a minute.  Is it you? 
[00:02:00]  Saying you're gonna be late?  No, I, uh.  Anthony should be here any minute.  He's here.  He's right here.  I'm looking at him.  What happened?  How come those messages take so long?  I don't know.  Yeah, Grand Central Parkway was horrible traffic.  It was some accident.  Uh, and it was like the shoulder accident, shoulder of the road.  Right.  But everyone's gotta stop.  So we came around one of the corners, you know, doing a nice clip.  Right.  And it's like, oh, great.  Brakes.  Grand Central Parkway?  Yeah.  That road is so fucking dangerous.  Oh, Jesus.  That road was made for the 1970s. 
[00:02:30]  For cars that sounded like...  Yeah.  It's a curvy fucking highway in, uh, the New York City area, Long Island, uh, to be specific.  Mm-hmm.  And the on and off ramps are like, what, 20 feet?  They're real short.  You've got to top fuel drags to take off, uh, to get into traffic.  Or you gotta, like, you know, hit that off ramp going about 65 and then jam on the brakes.  You have maybe 20 feet to get it down to about 40 or you're going flying off the side. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, because not only are the off ramps, uh, deceleration lanes very short.  Yeah.  But then they put these 90-degree hairpin turns.  It's a horrible highway.  I'm amazed there's not more accidents is my point here.  Yeah, so...  You got fucked with traffic on that today.  I did that.  And then, after sitting in that traffic, you get to the point where you're like, all right,  all right, it's that.  I'm looking at the clock going, okay, I've made that in 15 minutes.  I could do that.  And then you get into the city.  Right.  And if I don't catch all the lights right, it could add another, like, five minutes on.  Yeah.  And every minute counts. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Of course.  When you're just making it.  That's when you've got to just blow through lights.  I know.  Yeah.  I blow through lights.  Sometimes.  But now with the, you know, de Blasio's whole crackdown.  Right.  Yeah.  People, they're out there.  They're looking for it.  There's new cameras.  The fines are more now.  Where are the new cameras?  I don't know.  I know where most of them are.  They planted some new cameras in the five boroughs.  I break traffic laws.  And in the back of my head, I'm like, all right, if you get, like, if you get, like,  two tickets a year, it's so worth it in the end.  Worth the price.  I'm the HOV guy with just myself in it, in the car. 
[00:04:00]  No.  I'm like, if they catch me once doing this in a year, that is so worth the time I have  saved.  Yeah.  That traffic is fucked up, though.  It sucks, but.  I had to go all the way out east on Friday.  This is too local for people.  Maybe we should move on.  People have traffic.  Really?  No, regardless of where they're from.  So I'm like, Friday, all right, if, you know, there's a party for my brother, starting at  7.15, I think it was.  So I'm like, all right, if we leave at 2. 
[00:04:30]  2 in the afternoon.  Come on.  We'll beat everyone else out of the city that's, you know, starting their weekends.  Yeah.  Three hours later.  Three hours.  You can pretty much get to Boston in that amount of time.  Dude, I flew to Cancun for three hours, three and a half hours.  Being an entirely new part of the world.  Right.  Tell me why you're just out on Long Island.  It was over three hours in the end.  Painty ass.  Over three hours.  It's an hour and 45 minute ride.  So it was double the time. 
[00:05:00]  Leaving what I thought was sort of early on a Friday.  You'd imagine.  Sort of early.  I knew there would be something happening out there, but not to, oh, Travis wants in on  this?  Travi.  The traffic in and around New York City, I've said it many times, it will make a grown man  cry.  Yeah.  You see these guys in their cars when you're not doing it.  Uh-huh.  And they're sobbing because they don't know what else to do.  Openly crying.  Men crying.  You don't know what else to do.  After you punch your steering wheel and start fighting imaginary people in your car, the 
[00:05:30]  only thing left to do is just sit there and sob.  Hang your head and weep.  Like a bitch.  Like a band of brothers.  We're all just there in battle.  I had to run some errands on Saturday morning.  Yeah.  And I took my kid.  So I'm like, ah, we'll be gone 45 minutes.  A half hour or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, no.  I moved to Staten Island, so we're coming back.  Yeah.  Well, hey, doing good now.  We get to learn about Staten Island finally.  I know.  I like it so far.  I don't know anything about Staten Island.  It's nice and suburban.  When you get over that Verrazano, dead stop traffic. 
[00:06:00]  Well, so we are about to get onto the Staten Island Expressway coming back from New Jersey.  Uh-huh.  And we hit some traffic.  And I sat there five minutes away from my house for two and a half hours.  Oh!  Because a tractor trailer overturned on the Staten Island Expressway and pineapples were all  over the road.  Pineapples!  That's a delicious wreck.  And no one went anywhere.  Two and a half hours.  Did you get to at least eat the delicious pineapples? 
[00:06:30]  No.  They weren't even giving them out.  They weren't.  I would have ate some pineapples.  I remember texting my wife, be home in 15 minutes.  All right.  It was really two and a half hours.  I swear to God, it was two and a half hours.  I'll tell you one thing, too.  You should have just abandoned your car, go home, watch a movie, and then go back.  And by then, maybe they have everything cleaned up.  It's ten minutes away from my house.  I'll tell you something, also.  A lot of these crews that are responsible for clearing an accident, I don't know who it is, what  the fuck.  Look, I think they take their sweet-ass fucking time.  If a lane's closed, top priority, top priority, should be to open that fucking lane. 
[00:07:00]  The second someone gets on scene, open the fucking lane.  They probably get some sick pleasure out of it.  I bet they do.  I would, too.  I bet there's a lot of standing around, pointing.  Yeah, that looked, that's pretty bad right there.  So what happened?  Well, oh, we gotta, let me go to the radio, we'll get some other people here to assess.  They absolutely get a sick pleasure out of it.  Absolutely, yeah.  Absolutely.  Clear it.  Because they're just at work.  They got nothing else to do.  Right, right.  Why rush?  I love the volunteer fire department.  And actually, there's a few in my family. 
[00:07:30]  So relax.  Oh, everyone's got them.  But all of a sudden, they come onto a scene, and they feel like they're fucking cowboys for  an hour, so they'll park and block like two lanes.  I'm like, dude.  The fucking truck.  The accident itself, or whatever problem is, takes up a lane.  Then the truck has to pull and fucking block another lane for no reason.  That's someone that's someone that is on a power trip, like, oh, here's my tide to shine.  Pain in the asses.  Right.  That's why I live in the city. 
[00:08:00]  I don't want to live in New York City.  I do not want to live in New York City.  I've said this for many years.  But the traffic will just drive you insane.  It's definitely.  Even if, like, sometimes there's something to do on Long Island, where I'm from, and we'll  leave real early on a Saturday morning.  Like, all right, this is going to be a...  There's always something.  That's when they decide to do the moving...  The roving potball repairs.  Moving construction.  Moving construction.  Boggles the minds of drivers.  They don't know what to do.  Should I stay behind it? 
[00:08:30]  Should I pass it?  And the traffic is abominable.  Unbelievable.  With that arrow just blinking.  Blinking.  And they don't understand what that means.  You're like, I'm getting closer to what I've got.  It's blinking go to the right, you idiot.  Go to the right.  They don't get it.  Why wouldn't you zip around that as quickly as humanly possible?  Oh, those motherfuckers.  That's why I had to give up and get a place in the city.  Went out to...  It's way better.  Huh?  It's way better with kids once you move out of the city. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  I would like to move out of the city.  We'll see.  We'll see if we get that done.  You got grass.  We forgot what grass looks like.  I was at Bob Kelly's kid turned one, so we all went up to his house for a little birthday  party.  Suburban Bob.  And I felt...  I was in a backyard and there was like...  You didn't hear one car, one asshole yelling and screaming.  Barbecue smoke.  Was that barbecue smoke?  Barbecue smoke.  I heard birds.  Birds.  Birds.  When you hear birds, that's like strange to me. 
[00:09:30]  Nice.  It was nice.  Yeah.  It was almost creepy how quiet it was.  There's a trade-off there, but...  It was nice.  What's the trade-off?  Well, you get that.  What's so great about New York City in the end?  I'll tell you.  I mean, the ability to drive without, you know, to get to work and not have an anxiety attack  every time I'm looking at the clock thinking, there's another minute that ticked by.  The trade-off is you have to drive somewhere if you want something.  I can't walk down to the corner store anymore. 
[00:10:00]  See, I dream of that.  When I lived in Huntington, you know, I would get up in the morning, just jump in my car  and go.  I love that feeling.  Yeah, not anymore, though.  I know why I love that feeling, too, is because wherever you had to go, there was parking  just waiting for you.  Ah, yes.  That's true.  In the city, when you drive, we have a car in the city, and when I drive, I could spend  a half hour just trying to find a parking spot.  But if you run out of milk...  Or even a garage sometimes, that's a pain in the ass to find.  Now you've got to go to the grocery store, and you've got to park.  I would love all that.  I would have no problem with that. 
[00:10:30]  That's the one thing that I miss, is walking around.  So, whatever.  Yeah.  Walking around's overrated.  I'm walking around.  Stupid walking around.  Where at any moment, you could be in a fist fight, because everyone's just fucking angry  in New York.  Everyone has such an attitude.  You live in such a peaceful area.  At any second, you could be squaring off and fucking having a fight over the dumbest shit.  Everyone's just looking for a handout. 
[00:11:00]  That's true.  People that live in New York, they're all about the money.  The handout.  The money.  Yep.  Yeah, it was quite the little drive to AC over the weekend, too.  Because I left at, like, I guess 2, 2.30 p.m.  So, you know, again, it's just a dozen fucking stuff.  Wait, when did you leave?  Like 2.30 p.m. on Friday.  Oh, so you left the same time I was heading out?  Yeah, I was going the other direction.  You had to go through the city?  No, I went to...  Well, I had to, you know, go west, so... 
[00:11:30]  Oh, I went through St. R.O.  Verrazano.  Yeah, Verrazano, all that happy horse shit.  But, yeah, so, again, you know.  But I just kind of take a nap.  You should take the helicopter.  I will.  I haven't sent you a helicopter at this point.  I think I will next time.  I'll take the old whirlybird.  Have they whirlybirded you down there yet?  I haven't gotten the whirlybird yet.  I got the limo, so I just go to sleep in the back.  Shitty limo?  No, that's a good one.  Nice limo?  Yeah, it's the super stretch.  Plenty of room to lay out pillows, blankets, whatever you need.  Hoo-hoo. 
[00:12:00]  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  I hate limos.  I like limos that I could, you know, I could go to sleep.  If I could go to sleep, it's great.  Limos are stupid because the only seat that's good for me is the one facing forward, so that's  like a regular seat.  It's a regular seat, and now you've just got a very long vehicle that you're looking for.  Now you feel, like, anxiety because you're like, why am I so far away from everything?  I'm not even kidding.  Yeah, yeah.  I try the side seats and the laying down, and if I'm not facing forward, it's a complete  waste of time.  What do you get, like, queasy? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  You look queasy?  Absolutely.  Well, the famous story, you know.  Oh, yeah.  He tells it differently, but Bubba Ray Dudley drove me home.  Bubba Ray.  In his limo, because it was his limo, he got to face forward, and I had the side seat.  And I fucking...  Got a little nauseated.  I got car sick.  He claims that I puked all over his limo, but that's not true.  No, huh?  He's on the side of the road, on the service road of the Long Island Expressway.  Sounds like a real highway to hell.  Highway to hell! 
[00:13:00]  People seem to love that show on Friday, Sammy.  Oh, boy, was that fun.  I think we're going to make that this week's podcast, because the people are requesting  it, so...  That's a good one.  We'll definitely have it as this week's podcast.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony podcast comes out every Wednesday for your listening pleasure.  A lot of new music knowledge went down on Friday.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of people didn't know.  I think the fucking pie might have been my favorite after all.  Fucking pie is great.  After all that.  Yeah.  Let the Christmas spirit ring. 
[00:13:30]  Later we'll have some fucking pie and we'll do some gathering.  I love it.  One of the pre-show listeners called in and said that they really enjoyed the scenario  of Ringo having to shit with the door open, because Paul kept jumping on his drums.  Paul's going to play his drum tracks.  Very paranoid.  Yeah.  I would be paranoid if I was him as well.  Of course.  The shitting with the door open at the Apple Studios.  Well, there are rumors that Paul McCartney did a lot of the drums after Ringo went home, 
[00:14:00]  right?  Yeah.  We've heard those stories, so...  Imagine that.  You're just looking out the window.  They wait for Ringo's car to pull away.  Okay, he's gone.  Right.  Only Ringo knows, by the way.  Yeah.  Well, no.  A lot of people, I guess, would know, but Ringo really would know, like, wait a minute,  that's not...  I couldn't ever do that, Phil.  Right.  That wasn't me.  So that'll be the podcast.  Cool.  Yeah.  So we all saw your Twitter there, Anthony.  You did well, huh? 
[00:14:30]  Down in AC?  Another banner weekend outing in Atlantic City.  My voice is a little shot today, because as most people know, the strategy is to yell  at the dealer constantly.  That's what I do.  That's what gets you winning, I think.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  9-9-9.  What do the Germans say?  And the dealer's just looking at me, and I go, 9-9-9.  And then she's got, you know, turnover 9, and there it was. 
[00:15:00]  It was there.  A lot of times, that 9 shows up.  And so I was up and down a little bit, you know, kind of bumping back and forth.  And Keith was there.  Keith, the cop, is there to make sure things go nicely and go right.  So he was constantly pulling chips off my stack and paying off my markers.  And leaving me enough to, you know, continue.  Play with.  To continue. 
[00:15:30]  And then you just get to this one point where, boom, you hit, and you're infallible.  I had one hand, and that was the one that turned the whole thing around.  I had a bet up.  It was a $10,000 bet.  A $10,000 bet was on one hand.  I get dealt two fives.  Right.  Five, five.  That's a 10.  The dealer is showing a six-up card. 
[00:16:00]  So I'm like, I got to double down, but that was everything that I had at that moment.  So I got to call for a marker.  I got to call for another $10,000 to double down on the $10,000 bet.  Oh, my God.  So now I'm playing with three other people at the table, but they're all cool.  They know the deal.  So they have to sit and wait while all the paperwork goes through and everything.  And they run the marker out.  And, you know, we got to sign things.  The dealer's got to sign things.  They count out the $10,000. 
[00:16:30]  They place it down.  And then I slide it up next to the first $10,000 bet.  There's now, know your math, $20,000 on the table.  I get one card.  That's how it works.  When you double down, you get one card to make your best.  Foomp.  Ace.  Wow.  21.  Blackjack.  Well, not quite blackjack, but it's 21 on a double down.  Right.  The dealer turns over a 16, 26. 
[00:17:00]  Sell busts.  And I get paid off.  And that started the whole thing rolling.  Because now I got a little bit of a bankroll to play with.  And it just went from there.  It was crazy.  I'd never played with just $5,000 chips before.  Usually the pumpkins, the 1,000s.  You know, I've gotten up to those.  Right.  But just a stack of 5,000 chips.  And just every bet.  I was playing three spots on the table. 
[00:17:30]  Five grand a spot.  Jesus.  So it was 15,000 every single time the cards were dealt.  That's crazy.  And again, in those situations, sometimes you get dealt an 11, you've got to double it.  Yeah.  You've got a pair of 8s.  You know, you've got to split those.  So it got crazy.  But if you go to Anthony's Twitter, Anthony Cumia.  That was a big one.  You could figure out how much he went home with because he posted his winnings.  It was a big win.  You usually don't post your winnings. 
[00:18:00]  Well, I usually don't.  But that doesn't mean that's what I won.  Maybe I lost half of that.  Maybe I...  No, I'm just saying.  It was a very good weekend.  Oh, that's a very good point.  Yeah.  It was a good weekend.  Yeah, you could have lost the three quarters of that.  Who knows.  Whatever.  It was a good weekend.  You just want to do some bragging, I see.  It was fun.  Oh, my God.  Good for you.  Oh, my God.  And then that was just part of the fun because the other part was hanging out with the amazing 
[00:18:30]  Blue Oyster Cult.  It was hilarious.  That would have been cool if it was, I don't know, 1982.  Hey, they're great guys.  Are they listening right now?  It wasn't everybody.  It was Eric Bloom, the singer.  Is he the only one left as far as the original members go?  No.  No, Donald Rosen.  Buck, Buck, Dama.  Buck, Dama.  Buck is still in there.  He's in there, too.  And it was great.  It was a lot of fun.  Is that a band that has never stopped touring?  Yeah, I think they've been just playing forever.  I mean, because, no offense, their popularity drastically dropped, but they have continued 
[00:19:00]  ever since, right?  They still get out there and play.  How do they sound?  They sound great.  It was a lot of fun to go see them.  I was panning through the crowd.  And, wow, a lot of people that, I'm like, wow, they're at Blue Oyster Cult shows.  It's just like grandma and grandpa and stuff.  Well, when did they hit?  Mid-70s, really?  Early, mid-70s?  Don't Fear the Reaper.  When did that come out?  That's their biggest.  That's like 75. 
[00:19:30]  Reaper.  A big resurgence on this song because of the SNL cowbell bit.  Of course.  Which I spoke to Eric about, which was very funny.  78, that was?  76.  76.  So that's 38 years ago.  It was pretty goddamn funny, man.  He said he was just sitting at home watching SNL when that bit came on.  And it says, you know, behind the music, Blue Oyster Cult. 
[00:20:00]  And he said, he just ducked his head and went, oh, they're going to fucking tear us apart.  You know, I don't even know what this is.  And then they had him in the, well, it was Will Ferrell in the black leather suit with  a big gut.  Right.  Playing the cowbell.  Dink, dink, dink, dink, dink.  He found it very funny, but he thought they were going to just, you know, destroy him.  And he said, now he's got to talk about that fucking cowbell thing all the time.  That's awesome.  So I'm sure he doesn't mind. 
[00:20:30]  I'm sure he doesn't mind either.  That gave him a little resurgence.  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit, right?  It did.  Probably led to a few downloads for Don't Fear the Reefer.  A few downloads, a few gigs.  Probably got some nice pocket money off that SNL.  Yeah, yeah.  It was cool, though.  They sounded good.  Played all the, you know, the hits.  And me and Joe, me and my brother Joe know the band pretty well as far as their music goes.  So even when they go a little deep in those cuts, I'm like, ah, this is a great song.  Veterans of the Thousand Psychic Wars?  You know, stuff like that.  All right.  Astronomy. 
[00:21:00]  Astronomy.  ETI.  Flaming Telepaths.  Wow, you do go deep.  Yeah, this one I know.  This was almost a hit.  It was good, though.  For Western Cult.  Well, they had Burnin' For You was a big one.  That was a huge song.  That was a big one for when MTV first.  Early MTV shit.  Early MTV.  That was heavy rotation right there.  Right.  Nice guys?  Yeah.  Yeah, I really only hung out with Eric.  But, you know, and really a nice enough guy. 
[00:21:30]  Lives amazingly close to me on Long Island.  How close?  A couple miles?  Real close, yeah.  Even closer than a couple miles?  You could walk there.  You could walk to his house from your house?  Yeah.  He lives very close.  Will you be knocking on his door?  We discussed hanging out, yeah.  Oh, he'll probably come over for one of your parties.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Oh, that's pretty wild.  Yeah, this was a pretty sound hit for them back in the early 80s.  This was probably a lot of fun. 
[00:22:00]  It was probably 80, 81, right?  Yeah.  Right when MTV started up.  Because this was one of the songs with Pat Benatar and the Buggles.  Right.  You know, one of the heavy rotation songs.  That was good.  It had friends and family up also.  A lot of fucking people who just had a pisser out to dinner.  You might see Big A joining us for dinner right over there.  Big A is part of your crew now?  Big A, yeah.  Part of the crew.  Why not?  Is he part of your traveling crew?  Why not?  Got tax cunts over there and fucking Dennis. 
[00:22:30]  Fred from Brooklyn.  Not our Dennis.  Frank.  No.  Not Falcone.  Who would absolutely be welcome to come to one of these?  Wow.  Absolutely.  The fun never stops when Denny Falcone's around.  You'd probably tell us a little something about Blue Oyster Cult, too, I'm sure.  I bet he could.  I bet he could.  But that's okay.  Did you know they went by the name Soft White Underbelly when touring locally around?  Yeah.  And a lot of fun and hijinks at the blackjack table with those guys.  They play a lot of poker, though, too. 
[00:23:00]  And I played a little bit of poker.  And there was a fan, I guess, sitting across.  Because he kept...  Every time a black guy would win, he kept humming Highway to Hell to me.  Oh, no kidding.  And started laughing.  Can we hear Highway to Hell again?  I knew.  For a reference point.  That's exactly what he meant.  You got that, Eros?  Living easy.  Living free.  Seasoned decor.  I'm a long way to play.  Wow. 
[00:23:30]  That's so racist.  God, I'd never heard it that way before.  Now it's un-not-hearable.  The good old N-word.  Yeah.  The good old N-word.  The good old something, apparently, Justin Bieber is a big fan of using in his...  Is what excuses for jokes.  His so-called joke.  Is it an old video, though?  That is.  Yeah, he's 15.  And he's apologizing for this?  You don't grow out of that, though.  You don't.  How great is the apology now?  Now that we've kind of... 
[00:24:00]  Exposed it for what it is.  Exposed it for what it was.  What it is, what it was, whatever, yeah.  So what?  He told a racist joke as a teenager?  Who cares?  Don't we all tell racist jokes?  Yeah, and it was the typical teenager racist joke.  It really was.  Is it a bad joke?  Now, honestly, did you laugh when you heard it?  When I was 15?  No.  So, like, I played the video just yesterday when I saw this, and I didn't know what the  joke was.  So when I heard it, I admit I did chuckle, because it was ridiculous. 
[00:24:30]  Have you ever heard this one?  No.  You never heard that joke before?  I never heard that joke before.  Let's hear this.  This is Justin Bieber from, what, about five, six years ago, probably?  Yeah.  All right.  Warning contains language some viewers may find offensive.  Justin Bieber being racist on YouTube.  Father's Day.  Which is mean.  They missed the setup for that joke.  I know what that was.  Father's Day is the punchline.  Yeah.  Well, we know that joke.  The most confusing day in the ghetto, I think, is what the... 
[00:25:00]  Right.  That's just a straight day.  Why are black people afraid of chainsaws?  Don't even say it.  Don't say it.  Run-nuk-a-nuk-a-nuk-a-nuk-a-nuk.  You can say motorcycle, too.  Oh, geez.  who cares he made the sound of a chainsaw who gives a fuck but he used bad language so did  he have to apologize he did he did apologize i believe he did so this is becoming a joke we're 
[00:25:30]  never going to go 10 days uh without an apology 10 days we could literally make it five days  how many over the weekend and how many that how many apologies that we didn't even talk about  when we were away for a week there were at least four or five while we were gone yeah at least  like probably more like six and then i think there's there's at least two or three over the  weekend did you go for tattoo removal because you're so embarrassed by the guy that you have  tattooed on hold on let's hold on let's do the uh the justin bieber one first then we'll move on to 
[00:26:00]  jack white bieber apologizes for racist joke in years years old video uh justin bieber has  apologized for a racist joke heard during a five-year-old video clip of the singer that was  widely circulated online okay we heard it uh calling the comment a reckless and immature  mistake in the clip we heard that tmz reporter got the video four years ago but decided against  posting it then because of bieber's age and because he immediately told his friends what he did was  stupid it was reportedly shot backstage at a promotional event so tmz now feels like they 
[00:26:30]  should put it out there right i think it's odd that tmz decides what they're gonna put and not put  out there based on who it is yeah i mean that's ridiculous i mean uh what's her name that fat  cook woman there that paula dean paula dean paula dean you know paula dean uh uses the word  fucking 30 years prior right and uh gets in big trouble for it so who cares if he was 15 there  it was years ago well that's what this news site tmz is sitting there thinking well justin bieber is hot 
[00:27:00]  right now we don't want people who love justin bieber like justin bieber is good for business  loving bieber is good for business now it's better for business to not love justin bieber well here's  the apology as we once again try to go 10 lousy days on the opening anthony show without an apology  just not gonna happen bieber through a representative released a statement to the hollywood reporter  addressing the matter oh as a kid i didn't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt 
[00:27:30]  power words hurt words hurt words hurt people they do i thought it was okay to repeat hurtful  words and jokes but didn't realize at the time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions  were continuing the ignorance it's a joke i love catchphrases ignorance actions diversity blah blah  thanks to friends and family i learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologized for those  wrongs oh now that these mistakes from the past have become public i need to apologize again to 
[00:28:00]  all those i have offended i'm very sorry is he deeply sorry just very oh that's not fucking not  good he should have went with deep good enough you gotta be deeply i take my friendships with people of  all cultures very seriously and i apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish  inexcusable mistake inexcusable mistake inexcusable mistake i was a kid then and i'm a man now  really who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again ignorance has no 
[00:28:30]  place in our society it's it sure does it's the fucking backbone of our society of course it is  stupidity and ignorance ignorance it's a joke i don't get it it's a joke's a joke it's a joke i don't  think there's ignorance there right like i said i was at bob kelly's kids party yesterday and what do  you think was happening a lot of jokes there was a whole table of comics there you had the dan  soter you had the great uh greg gary goldman you had the keith robinson the colin quinn the jim 
[00:29:00]  morton uh who else um morgan murphy who's hilarious a hilarious writer um who's the guy that uh does the  podcast with bobby louise oh uh uh yeah yeah uh gomez yeah yeah he was there and and and the racial  jokes were flying of course just having fun and joking and beating the shit out of each other that's  what you do was anyone hurt because of the words a lot of people were hurt to anthony yes i feel bad 
[00:29:30]  about that i should deeply apologize they were they were putting their heinies in the ice that were  you know icing down the sodas and the beer i'm being but they were but hurt they were so but  hurt they had to put their fannies in the ice that's a shame oh god there's not i don't think  ignorance goes with with jokes no do you no you forget it's part of what it is it's a joke  bieber continues ignorance has no place in our society and i hope the sharing of my 
[00:30:00]  faults can prevent others from making the same mistake in the future  i thought long and hard about what i want to say how long do you need to apologize but tell the  truth is always what's right five years ago i made a reckless and immature mistake and i'm grateful to  those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man once again i'm sorry  oh our society sucks why can't you just say hey man i was 15 years old how old is he i don't even know 
[00:30:30]  uh i guess 20 then 20 ish something like that yeah and so i just went for a joke  some people were offended what can i tell you yeah what can i tell you yeah people are offended  don't start saying you learned and this and that an apology has to contain not just the apology now  it has to contain this um your explanation for having learned from right such a horrid thing that  you did right so you got to say i'm sorry and then say but look i learned and this is 
[00:31:00]  now something i understand well he hangs out with a lot of homies now right i bet you the homies  around him don't give a fuck they don't care he told a racist joke peck of wood crack of hate  you don't give a fuck he's paying their bills like of course they don't care yeah right so there you go  there's the first apology for today there we go one away cross that out and then we move on to jack  white i i you know what i don't even know why he apologized i said the same thing oh you did i have 
[00:31:30]  no idea i'll tell you why because this apology thing is getting so ridiculous there used to be a  time when someone apologized went oh my god what happened yeah now it's like people i i can't be  bothered so i really don't know why jack white's apologizing no clue i know the black keys uh his old  bandmate meg he's apologizing those people but i don't even know for what  well the black key it was you black black keys story blackies was the one that came out i think 
[00:32:00]  when he was getting divorced well i don't know the black key story oh he said that uh he didn't want  his kids in the same school as the black keys kids i want this story and he has to apologize for that  why well why didn't he want his kids with the black keys kids he doesn't like them he doesn't what's  wrong with that he doesn't want to have to interact with them as parents yeah so why does he have to  apologize for that now there's hip-hop beef between the black keys and the white there's hip-hop beef  right wow you know where that could go all right uh black keys kids assholes i don't know for sure 
[00:32:30]  escalates pretty quickly but then he also went in rolling stone that was kind of i mean he wasn't  taking shots at people he said in his apology he said that he was being too industry familiar  what does that mean you know like he was like his quote about meg white would i just read this  whole thing the apology is long the reason for the apology is long it's all very convoluted  jack white apologizes the black keys meg white in detailed letter jack white doesn't want to feud 
[00:33:00]  with anyone right now the rocker issued a long statement on his website saturday apologizing for  comments he made about the black keys meg white and others in the current rolling stone cover story  and attempting to explain the context in which he made the comments oh my god right i would love  to know what's up with the black keys kids are they the weirdos i don't know if the kids are  the black keys have weirdo kids are they dirty they may have the dirty kids stinky kids not sure 
[00:33:30]  what's going on could just be an ugly thing i don't maybe there's one ugly ringworm oh nits  nits are they have nits oh i hope they don't have head lice uh-oh i'm gonna go with the weirdos  they're the weirdo kids weirdos pick their nose and eat it oh yeah yeah yeah that's i wouldn't want  my kids hanging out with those kids either turn their eyelids upside down make meatball eyes  and eat their boogers too their boogers  white began by saying that he felt forced to discuss his private opinions because through the 
[00:34:00]  actions of lawyers trying to  villainize me in a private legal scenario my private letters were made public for reasons i still  still don't understand during his divorce from ex-wife karen elson private emails were leaked that  revealed white bad-mouthing the black key saying that they ripped him off and white elaborate on  those opinions during his interview with rolling stone that's when he was being industry friendly  black keys ripped off uh jack white familiar and white stripes which which uh which band 
[00:34:30]  um black key sound like uh jack white stuff in the way that a lot of bands sound like jack white  stuff that's true well then he's got something he's got something to say right that's right  but you can't you know what's wrong with saying that it's industry familiar it's in this right  it's industry familiar jack white's such an original that it would be pretty obvious if  somebody else is you know kind of taking his sound yeah wouldn't you think yeah i think so but i  think a lot of people are taking uh i wish the band the black keys all the success that they can get 
[00:35:00]  he said in his new statement i hope the best for their record label who has such a proud history of  music and in their efforts to bring the black keys songs to the world i hope for massive massive  success also for their producer and songwriter danger mouse and for the other musicians that their  band employs lord knows that i could tell you myself how hard it is to get people to pay attention  to a two-piece band with a plastic guitar so any attention that the black keys can get in the world 
[00:35:30]  i wish it for them and i hope their record stays in the top 10 for many more months and they have  many more successful hours i hope career that child is a masculine child something was said where  jack white's worried about a massive lawsuit that's the only reason he's saying what he just said there  right yeah white also apologized to yours he appeared to dismiss in his explanation of how  certain acts open up a market for a certain style white said that he attempted to avoid giving a no 
[00:36:00]  comment answer to rolling stone because he thought it would sound petty but ended up making comments  that should have been reserved for shop talk among producers engineers and managers  you're just not allowed like we have said for a long time now to give your opinion on anything  no but everyone wants it like everyone wants your opinion right they ask you for it and everything but  then when you give it it's terrible and you should be just exiled right no one's gonna know no one's  gonna talk eventually no one's gonna talk nope i wish no slight to the talents of winehouse 
[00:36:30]  duffy lana del rey and adele he explained on saturday all of whom are wonderful performers with  amazing voices well one might not be a wonderful performer by the way can i just add voice at this  point what could i just add i still have no idea why he's apologizing do you want to hear the quote  i'm getting there oh yeah that's his actor no the quote he's apologizing i folded this in half i'm halfway  done okay that's what i do now i have their records and i hope for more success for them 
[00:37:00]  all as the years go on they deserve all they've gotten and i also would love to state that i  personally fit find it inspiring to have powerful positive female voices speaking out and creating  at all times in the mainstream and all of those singers do just that so i thank them but he doesn't  believe this because he trashed them which i can tell you what he said well unless it's in is it in  there what he said or is that just what he said about the broads yeah well the broads all sound  kind of alike there's there's kind of a style there winehouse and duffy and adele certainly 
[00:37:30]  yeah i don't know lana del rey's uh music's not so definitely an amy winehouse vibe to it  so it became a thing right that's what he's saying a thing a thing a thing it's a thing became a thing  he's basically he said that uh uh that what's her name amy winehouse right was kind of she didn't  invent soul but she popularized that style for this time she brought it back and then strong and 
[00:38:00]  then he said uh duffy and lana del rey and adele popped up pat right and not oh no and then pat  duffy's abroad and then he said that uh he said that's the same thing with the black keys uh getting  popular once the white stripes faded away meaning that the black keys said oh the white stripes that  sounds cool i can make music like that right as opposed to actually being original right you see  that that's that's what he's really who was jack white's influence because that's the problem with 
[00:38:30]  music everyone is influenced and then hopefully hopefully you don't become a cover band and you do  your own thing or whatever right yeah the blues i guess would be his influence all right so  but the where would he be without the blues but the blues weren't popular at the time meaning jack  white didn't be like oh that's cool right now i can do that blues have always been popular sir  well they're not always have been popular they're not selling out stadiums well those guys did very  very well for themselves and every band uh since has kind of have has a little taste of the blues but 
[00:39:00]  there's a big difference between hearing a band on the radio and being like yeah i can make a band  that sounds like that and being inspired but my point is that jack white was also inspired  yes but not by what was popular right unless the black key are the black keys original even though  they sound sort of like the white stripes are they sort of doing their own thing because that's the  key so they have the whiny singer they are they're no they're they're they're not just white stripes  ripoffs they have originality to them oh yeah see if you're in the arts you're influenced by people 
[00:39:30]  but then you got to make it your own sure you have to or you're just you know considered a ripoff  right well howard's a dick for really he's just a dick because a lot of people i i was not  influenced by howard stern people think i was uh but a lot of people listened to howard growing up and  then went on and did their own fucking thing but howard insists that every single person that talks  into a microphone is that's true that's why he's a dick it's true there certainly are people that  probably try to do exactly what howard was doing sure but not not every single broadcaster you every 
[00:40:00]  one of them that's why he's a cocksucker anyway we continue here white also attempted to clarify  his comments about former white stripes drummer and ex-wife meg white whom he described to rolling  stone as extremely emotionally reserved saying she's one of those people who won't high-five me  when i get the touchdown what does that mean he said that uh she said that and then he said she  viewed me that way of oh big deal you did it so what like when something really good happened she'd 
[00:40:30]  be like okay so what as opposed to somebody being supportive and being like oh that's awesome but  she's one of those she's a weirdo she's like scared of her own shadow well he said they said do you still  talk to meg and he said i don't think anyone talks to meg she's always been kind of a hermit  wow when i lived in detroit i'd have to drive over to her house if i wanted to talk to her  so now it's almost never how did they get together we were married they were married yeah  interesting so they must have been doing some of that fucking right she sounds like a weirdo 
[00:41:00]  yeah so she probably hated him while they were having all that success so why is she gonna high-five  them i guess that's a good point i mean weren't they divorced by the time the band hit yeah but they  were stuck because they're like holy shit this is working so why the fuck would your ex-wife high-five  you ever have you ever high-fived your ex oh boy to high-five with the closed fist  he wants high-fives from his ex that's so stupid that is a little much they probably went their 
[00:41:30]  separate ways as soon as the the the show ended yeah i guess it's not really just your bandmate giving  you a high-five with your ex-wife yeah not supportive you know how hard she was hitting  the drum kick because she hated him your hermit ex-wife no she's probably not going to give you  a high-five wow he was really looking for something that probably i would imagine that meg white is 
[00:42:00]  actually giving a lot of high-fives just not to her ex-husband no ex-wives are not usually very  supportive and this jack white is a weirdo i love his music too i'm right there with sam i love  almost everything i would say everything i've heard from him i like yeah but he's a strange dude man  meg white who i also talked about to rolling stone about our working conversations or lack thereof  is of course a musician i've personally uh championed for 15 years he wrote she is a strong female 
[00:42:30]  presence in rock and roll and i was not intending to slight her either only to explain how hard it was  for us to communicate with our very different personalities and the fact that they were  divorced yeah was she getting some of the money from the divorce how did that work you think oh  that's a good question so she was getting her share and then also half of his share  why would he want a high-five at that point i wouldn't want to see her right he's getting three  quarters of the white shirt right this got blown out of proportion and made into headlines and somehow i 
[00:43:00]  looked like i was picking on her i would never publicly do that to someone i love so dearly  and there are mountains of interviews where my words are very clear on how important i think she is to  me and to music so i i like anthony i have no idea what this is about very vague topic why is he guilt  ridden yeah so he did an article for rolling stone magazine yeah and he spoke his mind yeah so that's  what rolling stone's looking for and that's what that's what artists used to do and used to be cool 
[00:43:30]  with they're like all right i'm gonna just speak my mind here fuck everybody but now i guess because  of this weird apology world we live in you're you're uber paranoid and then you have to go back and  explain everything explain your hurtful words what if you told your ex-wife that you uh no we're  gonna tell everybody we're brother and sister high five let's do that high five high five high five  he wants high fives from his ex no jack i'm not giving you a high five don't leave me hanging  high five high five you think there are a lot of don't leave me hanging a lot of don't leave me 
[00:44:00]  hanging and then she mumbled something under her breath yeah i fucking hate your guts high five why is  this band so successful i just want to be a hermit meaning i want to be away from you everybody's loving  the lego video meg high five high five leave me hanging hanging meg don't do that to me meg we got  a 43 year old on the line oh uh let's say hi to john on long island john hey you know what maybe  because i'm 40 43 a divorced white father i have no fucking clue who the white or the black keys are 
[00:44:30]  i couldn't tell you one song they they sing well jack white but i mean i compare and contrast i couldn't  even tell you i gotta tell you the black keys are one of those bands that i know about but i really  don't really listen to their music for whatever reason and they're they're fucking very successful  here's a little black keys for you john all right see you can hear the jack white in it oh yeah 
[00:45:00]  there's a major jack white influence here yeah  i can't explain any of these thoughts racing through my brain  it's uh i think it's in too many commercials for me to like right and this song in a few commercials 
[00:45:30]  for things video games cars yeah yeah it was a huge hit for the black keys oh yeah but i only  know this song and i couldn't i wouldn't know another one i don't think i could hear a little  influence a little bit i don't know who guy gets into a studio listens to such a distortion on the 
[00:46:00]  bass and it's like yeah that's good but it is good you know i just don't know who would think  that's good here's another one for cell phones and cars yep  i like it let's go to don in north carolina quirky music  yeah come on come on really hear it in the vocals come on it's that distortion the effect on it yeah  at the southern twang twangy high whiny voice yeah 
[00:46:30]  go ahead don hey guys hey buddy yeah this jack white guy needs to just calm down a little bit i  mean you get a cover of jolene by dolly parton what's it mean it's like the best cover of that  song ever you're a little biased i think why do you say that well you got your his name tattooed  on your arm oh yeah jack white jack white goes deep into the blues man so i mean he's influenced 
[00:47:00]  yeah yeah so the black keys were influenced by uh the white stripes i guess it's just a little close  you know yeah but they to be like oh we're a rock band let's be influenced by the last good rock  band they came up with really good songs and made it their own though that's my point  yeah yes sir yeah a good weekend um you get your new escalade yet not yet i get it i mean i think  two weeks have you seen that new commercial for cadillac's escalade yes i have what's the new 
[00:47:30]  commercial about did you like the ending because because the black couple pulls up to their nice house  and their nice escalade with their white butler with the white butler they have a white butler  of course it's 2014 have a good one thanks man thanks buddy yes didn't go unnoticed at the kumia  household what about alfred alfred's a white butler yeah but it's fucking batman that's right  exactly can't have a black butler hells no he'll steal all that cool shit 
[00:48:00]  and the black guy was the guy that invented all that cool shit thank god i'm a teenager i could still  i could say stuff like right five years from now i'm gonna have to apologize your hurtful words  yeah  can we play some black keys into the break you son of a bitch let's play one of those two songs  or you want to play some white stripes that's what i'd prefer all right hold on man let's  it is a it is a jack white thing same thing we have any more apologies or is that it i think those

[00:52:30]  really is a hazard you would think uh you know we would have figured that out by now yeah man make  everything round and and bathtubs are just horribly slippery and so slippery there's so many hard things you  could bang into corners you catch yourself by edges having your arm hit the side of the tub snapping  your arm just crazy things hanging off the walls towel racks and fucking tissue paper things right it's 
[00:53:00]  just cotton why have a barrage of obstacles why haven't we figured that one out yet a safe bathroom  oh like oh let's put down a bath mat that should take care of the situation bath mat so you step off  for that right onto slippery tile holy shit because we're all we're all just dripping water  because what happens is like oh okay well i'm on the bath mat so everything's okay and then you walk  out and you're still dripping white tile it's easier to clean and then you're like oh wait i forgot 
[00:53:30]  something in the bathroom wow fucking in your head ah you're fucking done took out alice what the fuck  took out alice the floors should definitely be the traction floors like where you get a lot of  traction why haven't they figured out uh i guess it's hard to clean is what it comes down to but what  do you want easier to clean or fucking uh dead alice yeah so you need that but if someone figures  out something there yeah you're gonna be a multi-millionaire and then everything needs to 
[00:54:00]  be recessed unless into the walls unless mr wonderful has to give you a talking to i'll take  60 of the company right well that's a great idea but i want 92 of the company right and you got 10  seconds to say yes or no that guy's a dick what an asshole he is he's a shark not an asshole no he's  a dick he's a shark dick a shark dick douche and you had him on and you let him off easy sir  dead you're good at the interview but you let off mr wonderful a little too easy he insulted the 
[00:54:30]  dollar shave club when he was on yeah i know say which is a wonderful wonderful company yeah what  he didn't see the viability of the the by the way i ran out of razors that's what sucks with sponsors  you get really into them and then they like go away and then now what forget about i don't even know  how to do it all i know is that we were getting free razors because of those people and they're  wonderful they really are you know you could just spend the dollar is that all it is that's why 
[00:55:00]  it's called dollar shave club yeah it's only a dollar a month yeah it's around there well oh what  a dumb business how are you gonna make money off getting only a dollar a month from your  it's a little more than that maybe it's a few dollars i'm not even kidding do we have any laying  around look you can get you can get the cheapo plan for a dollar a month that sends you a razor  no that's the razor that rips up your face no i'm sure it's a wonderful product the one that 
[00:55:30]  we were getting is the six dollar a month razor that's pretty cheap i got i ran out of razors  recently i don't know if oh it's because we're on vacation that's why you guys didn't get to see  this wonderful thing oh no what did you have i was i needed a shave i had no razors around so i  went for a cheap razor that i think my wife uses for her legs oh the one blade kind of i think it did  have two it did have the two blades and i dry shaved it and and my face it you could dry shave  if you have a day or two but you're if you're pushing close to a week dry shaving is just 
[00:56:00]  probably you're pulling the hair out when i was done when i was done i should have fucking  taking a picture of this i don't know why i didn't i was i was bleeding from all over the place  not just a little spotty blood like it was running down my chin especially around my chin area it  looked like i had like major acne when it finally kind of like dried up why did you dry shave  nah because i i dry shave a lot why if you got a good blade dry shaving is quick and easy 
[00:56:30]  throw a little foam on there i know but i had i had marks all over mostly my chin like i was like  13 and did an acne for the first time sticking little pieces of toilet paper all over you  did you have a little toilet paper yeah all that shit that's great the guy who played  greg brady is on the today show and actually looks just like alice now  wait barry's in town let's find out he's on the today show he's a big get today this

[00:58:00]  a woman scorned remember of course a woman scorned he seemed to have forgotten that and you want high  high-fives yeah we got what would the high-five happen you think after like what like like after  what after a good sad big hit big hit song maybe a big hit song like they're reminded of oh that's  right man yeah probably i mean when fell in love with a girl hit i'm sure he wanted a high-five from 
[00:58:30]  that come on that come on that's true come on up top come on up top i love his voice sounds like that  too well because it's putty putty was looking for high-fives at the car dealership right come on  high-five look at the jacket yeah i painted my face support the team  all right we're gonna break gonna go uh in a commercial with somewhat  jack white oh maybe that the latest song i like that thing a lot it's not getting a lot of air

[00:59:30]  hurt sam uh this guy named uh panster looks like on twitter he writes uh thanks to op radio  i just learned that one of my favorite white stripes songs is actually the black keys  maybe he has a valid point when people don't even know you know that's probably why it irked him  yeah too many people came up to him and said man i love that song and then he's like 
[01:00:00]  and then he looked around the room for a high five and no one was with him on that so  why would you want a who wants a high five yeah high fives are overrated i guess he wants it uh  wanted one you know who likes doing high fives two-year-olds they love the high five two-year-olds  two-year-olds they love it everyone else not so much yeah what do you get out of a high five

[01:01:30]  his high five he's hugely influential when somebody's that influential and has that kind of  success for somebody next to him not to give him a high five or to leave him hanging as it were  it's unacceptable that movie the chef looks horrible it's actually good you saw it yep did you talk to  that guy too right john favreau why did you see that because you were going to talk to john favreau  yeah because i was interviewing john was it good it was actually really good john fat bro i apologize

[01:03:30]  light and they said can you make us some recipes can we do some so we came up with these 20 great  recipes extra more to come and it's just like when you're cooking and you're grilling how  can you enjoy the beer cook with the chair put it all together now this is called a danger dog  i don't know if you've ever heard everything is dangerous everything about him is dangerous  and the key here is a danger dog making a bit all right those toothpicks for me right there 
[01:04:00]  uh look at that we hit the toothpick into it stuffed wrapped in bacon right there we're going to go to  the end this is the most dangerous this is really in his life this is the car i grew i am the girl guy  doesn't matter what kind of dog you can use a turkey dog if you want and if you go to the end  of the bacon that's all right i didn't explain it you thought the cake was going to be hitting you  take this stuff with the jalapeno any kind of flavors you want this is making a zero on the grill  this one danger dog now i've got a variety of dogs going for you here i've got some men  knock that whole grill over oh man look at the size of them look how big they get yeah it just 
[01:04:30]  depends on what you want i have the diet dog i have the danger dog do you have any idea they'd get  that big no when they come that big they stay oh oh now they're making jokes they're making dick  jokes yeah this for me you you take the lead all right we're gonna add a little bit of oil uh what  is this called okay that's hot don't worry about that don't worry about it it's hot but don't worry  you got some mustard seed right in there mustard seed okay okay you're gonna let those mustard you're 
[01:05:00]  gonna let those seeds blossom out there you go all right here we go or i'll give you this this  will be a little bit easier what you're making some fatal fries  i'm talking about a high five guy oh he'll be high five okay of course you know now this is the  one thing i do want to show you he's opening up a beer it's not how to open it but you have to  force it down so what happens here oh yeah you hit the carburetor right there and then it pours out  so you vent it or shotgun it if you remember that yeah that would be a guy and then a little salt and 
[01:05:30]  pepper a little hot sauce okay and then you wind up with everything and that's what you end up with  where do you put it what is he making no step further i like you're cooking in a pot here we go hang  on then just let me grab one of these can you take a sip of that oh danger dog i forgot your dog  pop it we've got a little bit of this uh mango jalapeno pineapple relish 
[01:06:00]  they're all just talking at the same time  throw beers into the crowd it sounds illegal just he just gave a beer to a 12 year old  that's not good i don't think he's allowed to do it no i don't think so i think he's gonna get in  trouble i think he's gonna have to apologize best hot dog i've ever had it's a danger dog of course 
[01:06:30]  it's good of course it's good if you wrap bacon around it well you know what i want when i'm hanging  out barbecuing what just a hot dog of course on a nice bun with some mustard he's got it now we wrap  it we need a pineapple chutney fucking wrap it in bacon now put this sauce on it that's your danger  dog it sounds exhausting it does sound exhausting bacon rules though we all know that right oh there 
[01:07:00]  you go stanley cup all right let me make this official because people have been waiting no no no  hold on let me make this official because people have been waiting the kings beat the blackhawks in  overtime to advance to the stanley cup finals it was an amazing game so you got the kings uh and the  rangers yeah i swear to you uh-huh i am going for the kings i know because you despise the rangers you've  said you've said it throughout the entire season you don't go for the team just because they're from 
[01:07:30]  the same state you're especially in hockey right especially in hockey so ladies and gentlemen  i'm uh uh i'm very sorry for you in los angeles it's certain i am so going sure to l.a kings  because hockey is a sport where you beat the shit out of each other so then your team's out of it then  you then you you root for the other new york team no well i can't even tell you how long i've been  a ranger fan so i'm definitely going for the rangers i see that ira uh iraq sorry iraq i see that uh 
[01:08:00]  roland has his rangers jersey his rangers t-shirt on today for the high fives in the subway  he likes high fives oh that's right he is a high five he's a high five guy you think jack  white would give him a high five up top oh him and roland and jack white would get along like old  friends but roland would have to wear like a white stripes uh t-shirt or something yeah he would and  then he would get high fives from jack white that would be huge right big gonna happen is he excited  that the rangers are in it yeah he's excited i mean usually even though it's not his team because the  kings won last night yeah he would have worn a kings t-shirt today oh right because the rangers didn't win 
[01:08:30]  last night it was last week but he's so excited about the rangers that he's actually showing  loyalty i need uh someone that knows more about sports than us which probably means most of our  audience get some girl in here then right um how many times have the rangers been in the stanley cup  finals since 94 or is this the first time since 94 i don't know the answer to that where's where's uh  danny then i don't think they've been not not in the stanley cup so this is the first time they've 
[01:09:00]  been in the stanley cup finals yeah in the stanley cup since uh 20 years 1994 and that's when we  started doing radio sir yeah they have a whole thing in the paper 20 years ago yeah my bag first  time in 20 years here comes roland yeah he's uh making his way down the hall there's no way i'm  going for the rangers trust me on that and most islanders fans uh feel the same way i do you don't 
[01:09:30]  just jump and go oh well let's uh let's root for the rangers there's no way i'm telling you you got  some assholes that will i'll tell you though as a yankee fan you kind of root for the mets when they're  uh but that one's that one's not as bad really not as bad but hockey man i'm telling you you just  beat the shit out of each other the chants are all about the other team's mothers and stuff and then  what you're gonna you're gonna root for them because your team's out you don't have to hardcore  root for them with the shirts and and uh yelling and everything like that but you could you could 
[01:10:00]  be like yeah i hope the rangers i'll send you the links and where to buy your t-shirts at oh yeah yeah  i need some is that a brand new rangers t-shirt that looks a little worn it is it's the morning  saint louis t-shirt are you all right you're gonna buy a new one yeah they're already ordered  for the high fives in the subway it says rangers the cup that's the new shirt yeah like the rangers  like they're on their way to the cup oh uh what they have huh they just showed greg brady uh they

[01:11:30]  those yankee fan that fan guys yeah but it's not crazy well the biggest rivalry in new york is  islanders and rangers that's that one is brutal man yeah yes way worse because the mets and the  yankees don't really play it they well they do now yeah they play each other what how many games a  year uh oh we need another girl to come in and tell us i think it was like five i think they play five

[01:19:30]  super group abba here we got a cell phone i'm happy with how the meetings went today the same  couldn't be said though for gene casem who feels carrie's efforts to obtain medical authority over  casey and her allegations of neglect are doing more harm than good he's crying  that sound gene says is a recording of her husband's reaction to what took place in court  he's a man of very few tears and while we don't yet know what happened she's a piece of  shit for doing that i have to hear let me hear frankenstein case him again she's a piece of 
[01:20:00]  shit because she talks about you know his legacy and then going out in a certain way and and she  plays that and she plays that so now we all know how how bad he's doing wow she's a piece of  shit she didn't need to do that to to help her no let me hear that again oh my god  the same couldn't be said though for gene casem who feels carrie's efforts to obtain medical 
[01:20:30]  authority over casey and her allegations of neglect are doing more harm than good he's crying  that sound oh my god that sound gene says is a recording we can't confirm this wow  whoa here's the guy that was a legendary a legendary radio guy and she does that to him i don't think  he wanted that out there gene no way 
[01:21:00]  horrible poor fucker wow wow  who is now 20 is calling his comments childish and inexcusable in a statement he says quote as a kid i  didn't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt i was a kid then i am a man now  who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again so the question a lot of  people asking we knew what happened with paula dean and now with donald sterling what's going to happen 
[01:21:30]  when people react to this does the fact that he was 15 at the time make a difference but i'm the first  person to give beaver a hard time i'll tell you that but i do like the i like him owning it and i like  his apology quick i like his words that he said there he didn't make a didn't put a whole lot  into it hey that happened a long time ago she's a kid he's owning it he feels bad for he's taking  full responsibility what's going to happen post you know today will be interesting though yeah  i think a mistake made as a 15 year old is not going to be held against him well we put this on  today.com we asked everybody will this incident have a long-term impact on beaver's oh this is 55

[02:01:00]  segregated parking lot holy shit that was it was a white black parking lot 100 percent like it was  like a uh like the mason dixon line what they told you where to go vacation but how do them up but they  couldn't say white black so how did they make it clear that whitey should probably go over there  part of the parking lot went to the white people you drive into the one you it's the second you drive  into the parking lot and see cars parked diagonally across three spots uh people you there are cars 
[02:01:30]  trying to get through the parking lot and people won't move like just standing like a car will run  over a person and they have no sort of god i would be livid yeah kenny sam you forgot uh trey dollar  sign was at summer slam summer slam there's nobody named trey dollar sign we're not talking about  summer slam i don't know what you're saying oh you were there i know i was in summer jam posted that 
[02:02:00]  the place smells like drugs yeah it smells yes i saw that marijuana in the air yeah because the the  cops and security they know yeah what the real deal is there so they're not worrying about checking  people's tickets like people are standing wherever it doesn't matter people are smoking weed right  cops are just there for shootings just there for shootings and fights right right cops are to collect  a paycheck that it they don't want no trouble right i don't want a deal right like we drove by a parking 
[02:02:30]  spot when we were in that area right because that also was the area closest to the stadium so we  thought we were gonna get a spot and i was like i think that spot's open some guy just steps in front  of the spot and just shakes his head no no yeah like when we left we left early uh my buddy joe oh i was  gonna say if you took that wife of yours no you're insane you mind if we dance with your dates if i were you  i would be no i went out to dinner with his wife last night oh well your whole family it wasn't just 
[02:03:00]  you oh that's what you think besides that i probably thinking of i was in sam roberts neighborhood yeah  but like slumming it huh when we were leaving oh yeah there was like empty bottles of dom  just laying in the parking lot because they're just drinking bottles of dom popping bottles in the lot  like the the grills that they brought which are like grills you would have in your backyard oh  yeah you meant the teeth no no the teeth stayed in their mouth the grills oh oh they're just turned 
[02:03:30]  over and like pieces of them are in front of cars just looked like a riot it was a riot and that was  the parking lot that's you take pictures all that yeah uh there's some of them on on instagram what uh  did you see any problems um luckily i was in like a little vip party area white area yeah um so i  didn't have to interact with where the problems were but everybody had a story about like i just 
[02:04:00]  the minute i walked out somebody was getting uh carted away and they said there was a pool of blood  right where the guy was getting carted out from yeah yeah because he got punched in the face i went to  the bathroom a lot of disrespecting going on a lot of punching for being disrespected i went into the  bathroom and i was just pissing but some guy was getting fucked with because he was taking so long  to shit and so the guys fucking with him went into the stall next to him and they started commenting 
[02:04:30]  on how filthy the stall next to him was of course and so i just washed my hands and tried to get out  of there because as i was leaving they were like i think we need a muck pint in here  i don't even want to know what that consists of i think it's uh throwing shit at each other  throwing shit at each other that's wonderful as far as feeling okay because there was a crack  security team right like me and my buddy got there early unintentionally so we just walked in and  wandered backstage yeah i just we didn't have any passes oh you just were able to do that we just 
[02:05:00]  would they assume you were probably part of the production i don't know one of the security guys came  up to me and he looked at the pass i had to wherever my seat was yeah and he goes let me just see what  these passes look like he's like okay so this is the backstage pass yeah it's like yeah yeah dude who's  in charge here ain't you oh wow now what's that guy doing he's dancing what did you call it uh oh he  was uh getting turned up getting turned up yeah there were a lot of people let's see this they were

[02:07:00]  that would be mine oh yeah you were there for eternity walking around with that music blasting  yeah and people all turned up did you see this is what the cars in the parking lot look like  what the fuck is that it's what are we looking at there's a tower of speakers on top of his car  like the sound system there's one two three four seven ten twelve speakers it was as loud in the 
[02:07:30]  parking lot as it was in the stadium but the guy next to him has speakers too and i'm sure they're  not playing the same thing no so it's just this loud mishmash of various people's music and like  girls walking around with shorts that were small enough that you could see a vagina wow yeah but  giant black women right and they're all wearing like the most it was ghetto prom hoochie my ghetto  prom like everything helicopter hair right yeah everything's got rhinestones everyone's had their 
[02:08:00]  hair right everybody look you gotta get your hair did i look good like my mom and jess were all like  you gotta be careful if you're gonna go to that show and i was like see i was like that's racist for you  to even right you don't see color yeah you don't and then i showed up at this show and i was like  holy this is dangerous yeah yeah yeah i'm in a dangerous area i don't see color i just see obese  women dressed in little tiny clothes  very cool wow sam you're brave video work what were you doing a study it felt like a sociological

[02:09:30]  hydrant just so they could knock the end off and jump around in the water nice  how bad did the cops want to just lock that street  and so we finally got out of that parking lot and we knew we were safe because we found the other  parking lot where all the guidos were hanging out like with their shirts off and i feel like they  were tough so it was like a prison yard it was a spike lee movie that rules uh where was your

[02:24:00]  and and we're gonna take turns peeing it's just what you do father-son bonding i go you go first  so he he pees you can just get his peeper his peeps over the top of the toilet over the rim of the toilet  which is but for a father is really like you know that's you worry because god knows what's on the  toilet seat and this kid could just get over the top but you don't want him smearing his little 
[02:24:30]  wiener on the toilet seat so he just gets over the top and can get it you know get it in there  so then i uh i whip out my hog  and you know you try to like cover up because but you don't want it to also be like you know what's the  big deal either so you you walk that fine line if oh do you understand what i'm saying not really but  i'm not a parent so yeah all right i know what you're saying because you don't want like sex to 
[02:25:00]  be this weird not sex but like sex organs and all that stuff to be a big deal out of it to be some  mysterious like crazy thing so it's it's one of those things in my complex or something you got  to kind of like i don't know toe the line so anyway my son gets bored like his dad really easily and of  course he has to start yapping and the the bathroom is pretty pretty full and all of a sudden he goes  he goes he goes i got a small penis you got a big penis oh no and then goes and mommy has a small 
[02:25:30]  penis oh man  did anyone start laughing well that's what i'm good at so  right away i go into shut the up mode because this is coming from a stall  mommy has a small so then he knows that um you think i like making people uncomfortable my my 
[02:26:00]  four-year-old son already gets the game of making people uncomfortable because i'm in shut the  up mode and all of a sudden he goes your penis is huge oh no oh no how embarrassing so we leave the  stall and uh now i gotta clean his hands you know so i'm lifting him up and this guy like comes around  from the corner and he's just laughing and i go oh you heard that and he goes yeah i go and then he  said something like well it could have been worse what i heard or whatever you know but guy was having 
[02:26:30]  a good laugh oh good laugh about it will fucking just blurt shit out right he said something like  that's not the worst thing he could have said that's true you know he could have said it was  tiny yeah but yours is smaller than mine would have been but then because i'm uncomfortable he goes  your penis is huge let's say hi to uh remy in missouri which is strange because like when i was growing 
[02:27:00]  up sex sex organs all that shit was off the fucking table talk about it you didn't talk about anything man  no so i don't know i don't i really am having not a hard time but i'm trying to figure that whole  that whole balance out remy in missouri yeah my whole family was out of my dad's ranch and my son  had never peed on a tree before and he had to pee real bad so i had to teach him how to pee on the  tree we get back to the group of people and the first thing he says mommy why is his pee pee so big 
[02:27:30]  meaning yours yeah yeah but i mean compared to a four-year-old we all look you know like we have huge peckers  exactly thanks rabbi so wow cute little story embarrassing that's one of my stories no kids  will really put parents in weird positions oh man say shit it's like oh my god all right yeah so pipe down 
[02:28:00]  arsenio hall was canceled thank god  it was terrible and it took a big gap in the seinfeld episodes but the leno uh guy came out  and then and you know showed arsenio that he was being picked up for a second season  yeah that didn't happen so even though he was picked up for a second season i guess the ratings  were just so horrendous and getting worse by the week that they said well i know we told you we're  giving you a second season but this thing is over it's unwatchable it's an unwatchable 
[02:28:30]  you're the only one on the our our show that watched it i watched it i've watched a couple  clips because you brought him to the show but it seems like he just decided to do his exact  show that was hot in the early 90s when he was like uh the young guy on the you know late night uh  talk show yeah circuit same look same vibe everything but and and worse yet he couldn't get  guests that was his biggest thing they would announce what guests are going to be on it and  it was a who's who of who but who why are the other shows playing hardball uh i guess so is that

[02:34:00]  in front of the kids so bj oh look out butterscotch jelly i call it a blowjob  because you don't have young ears well you do have young ears but i mean  you don't have younger ears yes wandering around your house yeah butterscotch jelly beans that's  dumb yeah oh i don't like that at all that's terrible horrible name for it how about uh you 
[02:34:30]  you into um what altoid snickers oh my god oh that's horrible all right amanda thank you all right  well you gentlemen have a good morning we're having a pretty good morning yes a lot of fun in this  jerk that's right all right um we're talking about uh well indirectly phil collins but supposedly phil  collins came out of retirement sam roberts yes and what he uh performed like being miserable in private  he wanted to go back into the public eye to be a miserable two i'm telling you two two guys that 
[02:35:00]  i really liked growing up were sting and phil collins genesis and the police obviously  and both were complete and utter dicks when i'm there yeah and i wasn't even i wasn't even being  that guy too long too long too long he's walking on the moon oh here it goes to see to hear to 
[02:35:30]  touch to kiss to join with me again just like that to take wire cutters to his lute 
[02:36:00]  can you can we do something different with this bit do you have him doing uh a police song with the  lute because i remember even being annoyed at that because we went and saw a sting and and his lute  and he finally played like uh war i think it was only one song anyone would know thanks but then he  had to play with the lute do you have that just the cast well there you go see pause is this from the xm 
[02:36:30]  taping okay the reason why everyone is applauding so hard is because this is easily an hour in easily  if not longer so everyone's like fine they that that was supposed to be finally that was finally  that was finally applause form right listen to the applause that he gets  just the cast away  i can't even sing along to it because he changes the notes right rescue me before i fall into despair 
[02:37:00]  i'm not a big fan of alternative versions of songs that i know and love  i mean you can around with it a little bit but you know why because you you want to sing along to it  when you go to a live show right or something you want to sing along to the song right you can't sing 
[02:37:30]  along to this because you don't know what he's doing with the music  and then he goes okay i could do this part i know this hold on  message in a bottle oh oh i got one word  i hear has passed since i rock my nose right 
[02:38:00]  i could have known it right from the start since i'm not alone and feeling alone what happened  you're way ahead  he was just a dick backstage i was lucky enough to meet him obviously and get a picture but  he got so annoyed because my flash didn't go off and i asked for a second picture how dare you there  was 10 people he had to take pictures with dare you we were that lucky we were you know it was one 
[02:38:30]  of those rare things that'll never happen again yeah it was eric logan actually because um sting wasn't  really meeting anybody just a few like really just a few vips and logan actually kind of you know  called in a favor i'm like man you know i don't ask for much but yeah you know i'm not like jimmy  where i need pictures with everybody but there's a couple that you know like sting to me was huge  when i was growing up sure and the flash didn't go off so i i was stupid enough to go could you do that  again is it sting and he got so mad it's like look we sat for your loot right how about a picture 
[02:39:00]  anyway so uh phil collins comes out comes out really oh wow  see that coming comes out of what retirement i didn't even know he was retired well he hasn't  played since 2010 drums i hear he can't really play drums anymore this is susudio  i heard turn it on again yeah at the gym the other day yeah that fucking song is still damn good turn it 
[02:39:30]  on i know that it's going to make a few people laugh out there but that song is still  fucking good studio apparently there's a girl on his mind something like that  man that alice looks like she smeared peanut butter on her teeth 
[02:40:00]  really should have taken care of take some of that brady bunch money and get some  fucking uh laminants the lord doesn't care about your teeth the lord doesn't really care  so let's hear phil collins he's with a middle school band why is his uh is his uh daughter in  the middle school uh it says that his kids uh both attend the middle school oh it doesn't say that  they're in the band where is this middle school uh miami obviously in between two other schools 
[02:40:30]  true gotcha and uh what he played in the air tonight he did uh in the air tonight and land of  confusion why would he do land of confusion maybe it was the band's choice no so what the band's  playing and he's just being the lead singer yeah he's singing so is it like a band like a rock band  or is it yeah oh okay yeah they're just middle school kids just middle school kids that's adorable  is this rock school it's re it's jack black's rock school yes it is black yeah but that uh started 
[02:41:00]  a whole trend across america that movie yes it did rock school does the little  know how to play that drum part let's find out all right let's find out yeah that's true i'll be  looking at him i was nervous you know because i've been doing this all my life but it's still  full screen now how good can it be how good could it be there we go tonight and all of these kids  all of these kids came up to me yesterday and were very very pleasant very very nice very polite  and they all made me feel like part of the band you see i even i even dressed in black and white 
[02:41:30]  but um they're a bunch of great kids they're sounding they're sounding really good tonight  and also i'd like to just before we start actually singing i have to give a little shout out to mr  winters here because he's got that one now okay first i'm gonna play a couple shoes 
[02:42:00]  i'm missing a couple of things  what is missing  too fast too you know we're assholes trying to slow it down that's kind of cool it's cool but 
[02:42:30]  they're going too fast  not the words when you're trying to sing a slower song it's sped up too much 
[02:43:00]  looks like uh what's his name from lost oh yeah he does  terry o'quinn terry o'quinn right that's who he's like the terry o'quinn  he finally gave up on the phil collins yeah it's the little tuft that is completely gone  i just want to hear the drums  i want to hear if the little  fucker pulls it off  yeah so far you've got this thing going too fast you've got  also you got phil collins on stage at a middle school with that and you 
[02:43:30]  fucking can't even keep them in focus right the whoever took the video of this stinks  this boy's still good huh 
[02:44:00]  so he's messing with the song just slightly that's a little bit i think he's trying to  slow these kids down a little right he did he reigned them in a little bit  all right here we go all right wait for it 
[02:44:30]  remember  look out of focus phil collins again  out of focus he looks like dr evil yeah he does you got phil collins there and you're  small what you don't  fuck yeah how about you don't go for the close-up because you can't handle it you see that it's  it's just a blur right 
[02:45:00]  take the autofocus off and fucking just focus on him  Christ here goes the focus key on everything because the lights are  fucking it up here we go here we go  he's 12 yeah that was bad this is um oh that's phil collins song on the drums someone is telling me 
[02:45:30]  what he looks black  oh it's a very generic version of this song but i mean you know i understand they're kids but when  kids play music it's supposed to be this exceptional thing let's say hi to mark in jersey  mark what's up guys hey yeah later on in the video he comes out from behind the drums and phil 
[02:46:00]  so i would hope he did it right he's been hearing it for a whole damn life right so that is phil collins  son on drums that's kind of cool then what the hell  this is the first time he's sung in three years four years sam yeah why hasn't he been singing  do they explain no he just stopped anger issues um  um  yeah i don't know all right 
[02:46:30]  yeah yeah bill to lindsey yay and then what did they do land  it's a little more rocking a lot going on in that song too though  there you go yeah right  we actually have another song for you guys 
[02:47:00]  people losing their minds that's kind of cool  i want to let you know how all this happens tonight oh who cares a lot of these students are  trained in different ways some are trained classically some are trained by ears and we're trained pops  um we actually have a lot of these scores no one cares  by an artist here in miami who transcribes all of it and he actually came here tonight  and this is going to be the first time they came back to me 
[02:47:30]  oh i see what happened pat seymour  seymour butts  get it no one cares  wow  all right now what happens  now what why didn't they edit this video  tonight i actually brought come back here come back here you can't go yet 
[02:48:00]  oh who cares why why wouldn't they edit this part out for youtube right  of landing confusion you see these this thick book here  this guy wrote it right here this guy oh my god just played land of confusion this guy wants to  make it his little moment let's say hi to brother joe brother joe oh no i have something much better  this time you're saying how much you were at this thing did you know that uh you know that sting has  a kid that plays bass i sure do we did uh you know about friction plane then yeah we uh we did a whole 
[02:48:30]  hour on like uh rock stars uh kids yes and realized that they all suck yeah that they're terrible  they were they were almost friction plane uh i'm trying to remember what what uh song  dude i i don't you know i don't even know just like the youtube the best one the first one that  comes up the kid is freaking exceptional to his 20s he opened for the police a few years back  so maybe he's gotten better because we haven't done this bit in a few years but we did  oh no this kid we did paul mccartney's kid what is his name uh james mccartney or something 
[02:49:00]  harrison's george harrison's kid and and uh john lennon's kid had one hit obviously yeah uh  then we did sting's kid we did uh i think we oh there was someone else they just can't attain that  you know thanks all friction playing the kid i mean he is does he say we're talented oh yeah  he sings and plays bass they sound like sting there i say better better than his dad when his dad was  well sting's voice is pretty good this thing's got the hits yeah amazing amazing if you get a 
[02:49:30]  chance but i got a few hits yeah like play play anything by friction all right go find friction right  now all right thank you joe thank you joe all right give me the biggest song by the band friction who  who features sting's kids i remember we did this bit and we were not impressed by any any rockstar's kid  no loot hmm what's what would be their biggest song by friction probably the one with the most 
[02:50:00]  hits yeah what do you got most views what do you got sam looks confused that could be anything  are you thinking of his sexuality yeah what do you got what do you got we're just sitting here  we're just sitting here saying what do you got we both know this break isn't going that well we're  trying to try to pump it up a little what do you got well there's a lot of stuff called by friction  band all right well do you think that's them i don't know neither do i oh he's got tinnitus that's 
[02:50:30]  why phil collins doesn't play out i heard something like who doesn't oh yeah damian marley is great of  course but in general that's a good one actually that's a tough one to argue yeah damian marley did  pretty well marley yeah he did pretty well for himself you got you got the ziggy marley he did  all right for himself it's a ziggy you got the marley's the marley's do all right for themselves but  in general i don't know there's what i mean paul mccartney's oh what is this i mean it says friction 
[02:51:00]  band but they're doing bohemian rhapsody friction plane it's all covers it's friction plane friction plane  yeah it's friction plane and that would be p-l-a-n-e and what's the number what's the song  that we should play two sisters that's all right two sisters is the big song  this sounds a little stingy sounds like he ripped off jack white to me  i'm walking on the moon 
[02:51:30]  i can hear sting in that that's a great voice right there  this ain't bad at all  i don't want to miss the last train 
[02:52:00]  but this flight at least once means my name  go to size to the right to the left of me  go to size and meet me do it again  my heart don't stop to judge me not  i think i think i think i think i think 
[02:52:30]  i'm in love with two sisters  all the way  it's pretty good  a little jamara quai  a little jamara quai but uh no it's actually pretty good problem is the song seven years old that most of  us don't know i've never heard that's the problem does he do a police song i'd love to hear him do a police song  is there any other other songs by uh fiction plane who's this bitch on the tv  i don't know  i don't know  birdie  who the hell is birdie  the fuck is birdie  fuck birdie  hard to keep track all these 
[02:53:00]  bitches  she looks like lords what's proactive  yeah she's got that look where she's just like melancholy  i'm gonna be melancholy  i'm sad today i'm gonna be melancholy i'll write a song i'm gonna make sure my hair is flat i'm  gonna wear a big red lipstick my hair is flat and uh i'm gonna have a pale face  and uh my my my song's gonna speak to the melancholy people 
[02:53:30]  to be attractive right i have my music and that'll speak that's all that matters  people will understand so i'll leave my hair greasy right and i won't put on makeup except for  the big red lipstick just the big red lipstick that's it that's every chick these days all the  chick singers what's this sam this is the police the police and leash fiction plane but we were  looking at friction plane before singing next to you in hawaii well next to you is a police song 
[02:54:00]  did you know that sam roberts yes i did all right let's hear how this sounds  a lot of people right there what is this uh 2008 oh boy six years ago  who's that sting who's that guy sting i saw the police when they got back together i guess it would 
[02:54:30]  be about 2008 he's amazing i loved it i absolutely loved it is that his son that just came out  i can't tell which one just the energetic one is the sun  nice recording  whatever his son can sing and uh 
[02:55:00]  that's fine there you go proud dad out there playing with him it's too bad uh the band's not 
[02:55:30]  doing better fiction playing the kid does sound like he has uh the skills he has a good voice  it goes back to our point rock star kids they just don't pop very hard to get successful some of  the athletes kids they do all right yeah yeah they pop like um well you got your  bob dimaggio got your griffey's yeah you got your uh you got your uh griffey's and then there's the um 
[02:56:00]  um i have to go with the the earn hearts got the earn hearts you got your bob ruth you got bob ruth  who's bob ruth who's who did very well after uh yeah babe yeah yeah yeah yeah bobby ruth was great  oh yeah  glenn garick glenn garick glenn garick's disease yeah it wasn't as bad no it's just a hangnail 
[02:56:30]  very under-reported  glenn garick's disease  taken care of with a nail clipper you know why because if you want to like talk serious for a  second the reason why rockstar kids don't do well and athletes kids don't do well in general  in general yeah they didn't they never had a struggle that's true you gotta think it's like  they kind of they got they got everything handed to them so it makes at least the launching pad yeah 
[02:57:00]  there's something to be said about being hungry you know what i mean being hungry and comment and not  knowing and not knowing if you have anything to really fall back on if if you fail and then for some  weird reason it makes you try harder and you you you know damn well that a very popular rockstar's  kid is going to get those doors open of course to get their recordings listened to the right people  hook up with a tour things like that but they don't know they don't know true failure what  they get a bad day trying to make it as a musician they go back to a multi-million dollar mansion 
[02:57:30]  overlooking all of la or something  my room right yeah right fuck you dad i gotta live in your shadow i have my own music to you  exactly though oh christ makes it hard yeah gotta be hungry uh yes uh what all right hold on i'm  gonna learn about phil collins what the hell we're down this road we might as well continue john in texas john 
[02:58:00]  how you doing guys hey two quick things uh phil collins sort of semi-retired a little while back  because of severe neck and spine problems which didn't allow him to perform that's number one  number two his son is named simon collins and he has a band called sound of contact which are very  good i don't know the names of any of their songs but if you could look up sound of contact you get a  taste of what he's doing simon collins sound of contact see we kind of did this bit but we haven't 
[02:58:30]  done in a while so sound of contact that's phil collins son's band all right we'll look up one of  those although uh sammy just uh left the studio phil collins son thank you sir okay uh let's go to uh  tj what's up fellas and someone's saying it goes with actors kids too for the most part yeah you do  have your exceptions of course but you you would assume there'd be a lot more who do you got well you  got uh what's some of the magnet sons we got well richie richie cunningham's kid does pretty well who 
[02:59:00]  richie cunningham his daughter yeah she did she does all right we got uh kate hudson kate hudson uh  uh she does all right we got uh um um um oh we got that angelina jolie's father angelina jolie  angelina jolie yeah she's all right we got uh uh lies of minelli keefer suverland 
[02:59:30]  colin hanks colin hanks thank you look at this guy's not even calling for this he's on the fargo and  that was uh he's very good on the fargo great colin hanks is absolutely great he's stepping and  he stepped outside his father's shadow a long time ago god dick we got to charlie sheen good dude too  we got good no what about uh bill bogart bill bogart bill bogart bill bogart did all right for himself 
[03:00:00]  he actually uh was trying to get a here smelling you kid uh to catch on but it never did it never  did i like his poppy pick the wrong sense uh what do you got on the phil collins tj uh so like 15 or  16 years ago i used to work for this rehearsal studio in the city and uh all these big big name  acts before they play the garden or play david letterman or whatever they come and rehearse  and play at this studio in the city but anyway i was there to pick up equipment and the person who was 
[03:00:30]  supposed to open the studio had not yet and phil collins was out front pitching the biggest  tantrum i have ever seen a fit oh my god he was he was freaking out he threw his coffee he was like  through his coffee that's insane tj tj i know i do all this but what about phil collins oh no oh see what  see somewhere somewhere somewhere someone is telling that exact same story about me so yeah 
[03:01:00]  i hope he was throwing shit and it was phil collins all right tj thank you buddy yeah all right peace  yep uh you got phil collins's son's band yeah how do you say that simon collins vocals drums does it  just sound like phil is this that's another problem the kids have they sound too much like their  fathers even if it's a better stings kid sounds really good absolutely definitely sting type voice 
[03:01:30]  right yeah but it seems like an updated version of his voice that makes sense i think he's got better  range and a little more power power to it it sounded great and this is the best song from sound of  contact this one has the most hits on youtube sock for short oh which one is phil collins bigger kid  than these uh father said drums and vocals so i'm assuming is he on the drums 
[03:02:00]  can we go full screen uh please  oh that sounded a keyboard hit sounded a little genesis-y  sounds cool as hell well genesis-y i like this another out of focus oh he's going for a depth of  field i see there's a lot of talented people out there huh 
[03:02:30]  when do they start singing  why are you laughing i just i don't know i i like frog lock but this is so fucking cheesy  as many changes as you can put in a song and come on i hear a lot of i hear a lot of different 
[03:03:00]  genesis songs in here yeah yeah yeah  oh i knew it oh this is just cheese rock i have a feeling they're never going to sing  you got to get the big guitar lead in there are you starting to think they're not going to sing  yeah this is that self-fucking self-indulgent masturbatory  the mics are just to thank the crowd all right eight minutes on

[03:04:00]  fucking i want to hear some vocals there's some more  shit this guy i'm glad i'm glad he went nowhere what a dullard  all right what's what's going on does his son sing or not it says vocals well there's no vocals  unless he sings exactly like a keyboard  the hell  ringo's son tours with the hoe yes uh zach starkey he's actually a really good drummer we know that 
[03:04:30]  he's awesome what do you think we were born yesterday dad probably give me a give me this  kid singing does paul mccartney's son threaten to record his tracks over again  you would think the beatles kids would get together and figure it out like why don't we do  something let's do it why not is this him jesus  it sounds just like phil collins oh he's doing he's doing genesis oh keep it dark right 
[03:05:00]  it's an actual genesis song

[03:17:00]  though do you no okay because because it's a cuisine some some of the food needs to be small  because it's rich some of it was really tiny yeah really yeah like i thought at one point they brought  out what was amounted to uh something the size of a sweet tart with like a little bit of caviar on  it and stuff i flipped it on my thumb in the air and caught it with my mouth nice classy you go there and  then you walk down to like a a burger like a jg melons and is that with a shake shack or whatever

[03:20:30]  see a food truck suit over there we're doing waffle pizza and we'll pick up the leftover pizza from  our show and make some dummies there's no leftovers you know you can also just do a little skillet  i'd recommend putting it on low on the fire just putting your pizza in there slowly slow and slow to  get the bottom never microwave and just put a little olive oil on the bottom of the pan if you  want and just let it go oh okay yeah and this will bring back that nice crisp listen to that oh yeah
