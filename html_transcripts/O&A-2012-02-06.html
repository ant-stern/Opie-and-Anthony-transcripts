<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing furious indignation at their exclusion from SiriusXM's Super Bowl Radio Row event.  They lambasted the perceived slight, citing numerous social media posts showcasing the event's celebrity attendees and questioning the number of SiriusXM employees in attendance.  They detailed a contentious conversation with their boss, Bob, regarding the incident. The discussion then transitioned to the Super Bowl game itself, celebrating the Giants' victory over the Patriots, focusing on crucial Patriot fumbles and Eli Manning's performance.  A humorous anecdote about Bob Kelly's enraged reaction to the game, complete with profanity and a prematurely switched-off television, was shared, along with a voicemail from Kelly echoing his displeasure.  A brief mention of a call with comedian Bill Burr was made.  The hosts then launched into a vitriolic, profanity-laced tirade against MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski for her apparent lack of awareness regarding the Super Bowl, using a news clip as evidence.

Next, a significant portion of the show was devoted to a scathing and highly offensive critique of Madonna's Super Bowl halftime performance, targeting its choreography, song selection, lip-syncing, and perceived audience disconnect.  The hosts contrasted it unfavorably with past performances by Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen. They also briefly discussed the Puppy Bowl and other Super Bowl-related events. The segment concluded with Jim Norton announcing his new persona, "Michael Carter," accompanied by sexually explicit details, leaving the hosts and listeners with little explanation.

The following segment tackled Super Bowl commercials, with Opie, Anthony, and a possible third person (possibly Sam Roberts) offering vulgar commentary on various ads. Commercials featuring Clint Eastwood, Mean Joe Greene, Elton John, and Fiat were analyzed, along with those featuring Matthew Broderick and Seinfeld. The Volkswagen "The Dog Strikes Back" commercial was highlighted as a popular choice.  The conversation abruptly shifted to a graphic discussion of a book detailing a lengthy affair between intern Mimi Beardsley and JFK, using extremely crude language to recount alleged sexual encounters, drug use, and even a forced sexual act involving another person.  Mimi Beardsley's name became a recurring punchline for sexually explicit jokes. The segment concluded with a "Fuck You" segment featuring listener calls expressing frustrations, announcements of upcoming guests (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Smith, and Daryl Hammond), and further discussion of the JFK book and the hosts' desire to interview the author.

A lengthy call from a listener, "Dave," a self-proclaimed "Super Bowl baby," followed.  Dave detailed his disillusionment with Howard Stern, his depression, movie analogies, Don Corleone impressions, and a reality show pitch.  The conversation turned to the presidential election, focusing on Mitt Romney's momentum and Barack Obama's perceived aging, including a humorous discussion about which presidential candidates the hosts would allow to perform anal examinations.  Steven Singer, a jewelry store owner, and his assistant, Leanne, then joined the show, discussing Singer's business, security, and the opulent nature of his Philadelphia store. Singer also criticized the Opie and Anthony studio's condition and the show's management. The segment ended with the announcement of a contest winner.

The final segment featured a wedding speech contest with a $1000 prize, showcasing highly profane and sexually explicit entries, notably one by Sean Ryan. Stephen Singer, owner of IHateStephenSinger.com, a rose retailer, gave away roses to callers. The discussion was filled with sexually suggestive humor and crude jokes.  The show briefly acknowledged Black History Month by mentioning Blue Ivy Carter.  The entire segment was characterized by vulgar language, sexual innuendo, and off-color humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Lots of those.  Morning. Fuck.  Good morning.  How's everybody doing?  I do want to acknowledge the fine listeners of this show.  Yeah.  They were just beating us up since Friday.  They were kind of referencing being at the Super Bowl.  Oh, yeah.  And then going, oh, that's right. You're not there. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, guys, you must be having so much fun.  It's, oh, that's right.  You're not there.  Okay.  Every one of those made me howl this weekend.  And then I've never heard two words, Radio Row, more than I did this year.  And the first time I even heard it was when we were told we wouldn't want to be there.  Yeah.  And then everyone was talking about Radio Row.  It was literally the place to be.  I'll repeat with you.  The place to be. 
[00:01:00]  And, you know, we weren't out there.  Davey Mack was apparently at the Super Bowl.  But I don't think that had nothing to do with the company.  No, it didn't.  But just the fact that he was there.  He's a huge Giants fan.  Who's Davey Mack?  Dave McDonald.  And he's Instagramming from his seats.  He had great seats.  Yeah, yeah.  That really rubbed it in.  It was just another thing.  Right.  And, you know, God bless him.  I love the guy.  It's like, there he was.  Yeah.  He's there at the game.  Yep. 
[00:01:30]  We figured it out.  Oh, I was tweeted so many pictures from Radio Row.  Just celebrities in a party atmosphere.  And just, wow, this is the place to be.  One was like, hey, Hope, I thought I just saw you at Radio.  Oh, that's right.  You're not here.  Oh, right.  That would have been impossible.  Right.  Because we all know you're not here.  Oh, boy.  Did I give Bob a talking to on Friday?  And he got right on it.  Did he?  Yeah, he made some people jump around here.  I don't know what that'll mean in the end.  And nothing.  He's making people jump.  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, fuck yeah.  For what?  What's he going to do?  What are they going to do?  Send us to the Super Bowl now.  No, I told you.  They're going to send us to Indianapolis now.  They're going to come in and go, we got tickets for Tuesday morning.  We're going to get you right down there so you can watch them clean up.  I told Bob at this point there's nothing they could say or do.  No.  Well, maybe they could do.  But there's nothing this company could say to me anymore.  There's no excuse now.  It's just all bullshit.  For us having not been there.  Right.  There's really no excuse.  They can't say this is why. 
[00:02:30]  The whole thing of trying to protect us from Radio Row now is so ridiculous now.  We could go in the office now.  Right.  Have a meeting with him again.  Right.  And for him to repeat that to us would be so utterly ridiculous that it couldn't be done.  And there's no other excuse.  No.  Like his only excuse was, well, we didn't want you to be on Radio Row.  I think Radio Row was so hot that it was trending on Twitter.  It was trending.  Radio Row was trending.  It was a hot hashtag.  We didn't want to be there. 
[00:03:00]  No.  No.  You know, the place where everyone is.  Oh, boy.  And I did a lot of detective work over the weekend.  Did you?  The amount of people.  Were you a private dick?  I was a private dick.  The amount of people that got to go from this company.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  From this company.  Oh, yeah.  Holy shit.  Huge amounts of people.  Behind the scenes people.  They've decided.  They decided this year to have a big presence at the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  And for some reason, we were left out.  And then we'll have this dick down the hall go, no, man, we need to get you guys out there. 
[00:03:30]  We need to expose you more.  Yeah, we'll do another appearance at the Hard Rock.  I want to get you in front of a lot of people.  How many times did he say, I want to get you in front of a lot of people?  Well, the Super Bowl.  You guys need to get in front of a lot of people.  It's not really a lot of people at the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would have been a...  There's nothing.  I mean, nothing Scott Greenstein can say to me at this point.  Everything that...  Nothing.  Everything over the months and even years we've been told about where we should be, 
[00:04:00]  what we should be doing, was exactly the Super Bowl.  Right.  That is exactly the type of thing that's perfect for our demo.  It's perfect for this show.  Right.  And it's perfect for getting out.  Like they say, we need to get you out there.  Perfect.  Yeah.  But yet that was the thing we were not privy to.  Yeah.  Which is fine.  But you can't...  You can't like blatantly lie to our faces.  I know.  That's just crazy.  And then want any type of respect from me.  I'll speak for myself. 
[00:04:30]  Who's that?  Huh?  It's just a million pictures from Radio Row.  That's Sway.  Sway with...  That's Tim Tebow.  Tim Tebow.  Looks like Tebow.  Sierra.  And Sierra.  Ah.  That's nice.  Well, no.  That guy we were protected from that.  With the big Sirius XM logo behind that.  Yeah.  Because they had the Sirius...  They had the...  We were protected.  They had the Sirius XM logo everywhere.  Look at that.  Larry the Cable Guy.  Larry the Cable Guy.  Representing the company.  Mark Says Hi.  That's Mark Says Hi right there.  And Mark Says Hi was there. 
[00:05:00]  Mark Says Hi was there.  Holy shit.  Who's the...  Who are these people?  Sirius XM Fantasy Sports Radio.  Fantasy Sports Radio.  Fantasy Sports Radio.  There they are with the big logo behind them.  Throwing up some gang signs.  Nah.  On Radio Row.  Oh.  There's the Mad Dog.  Yeah.  The Mad Dog with Bob Craft.  With Bob Craft.  You know, we're going to talk about the Super Bowl, obviously.  But one of my favorite moments was at the end there.  Bob Craft just standing there like... 
[00:05:30]  But this was supposed to happen.  He was shell-shocked.  I lost my wife.  This was supposed to happen for me this year.  But we have Tom Brady.  But what happened there?  Brady did his job.  His fucking receivers could not hold the ball.  Yeah.  There were a couple of big fucking plays that were...  They couldn't hold the fucking ball.  No.  No.  On the final drive, there was two drop passes.  On that next to last drive, there was a critical drop pass.  This would have kept the drive going.  Yeah.  There was Bob Kelly on suicide watch.  Bob was...  Can I tell you, at the end of it, when it was after that, how Mary failed. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  I was watching with Bobby, his wife, and his other buddy was over.  Yeah.  And Bobby keeps turning...  Because Chris Collinsworth really is a biased twat.  I hate Collinsworth.  You don't like Collinsworth?  No, I hate him.  Why?  Because he's...  I like how he calls games.  He stinks.  He was very biased in favor of the Giants.  Yeah.  Which is fine, but it annoys me when I'm not rooting for the Giants.  Mm-hmm.  And at the end of it, Bob immediately turned the TV off, and he just starts going... 
[00:06:30]  He's going like, you know, what the fuck?  You know what, dude?  Fuck Brady.  Fuck...  You know what, dude?  Fuck Boston.  And so me and Bob's other friend are just kind of like on Facebook and Twittering, and  Bob goes, yeah, this is nice.  All you're doing is just...  This is real social.  I'm like, do you think this is a pleasant experience?  You turn the TV off.  We have to listen to you curse.  You cunt.  I want an answer.  That's hilarious.  Wait, when did he turn the TV off?  No, at the end, but he kept...  The second it went over, it was over.  He kept turning the volume down, because he hated Collinsworth, too, and he kept going 
[00:07:00]  downstairs into his bedroom, and I would just turn the volume up so he could hear.  God, you prick.  That's so fucking funny, though.  It's like, he started ragging you guys.  You know, we're here.  Why aren't we talking?  Because we're Twittering, and I'm like, Bob, all you're doing is cursing.  We're not even watching.  The game's over, but you just turned the TV off, and we're listening to you complaining.  That's great, Mike.  I have to keep the TV on.  If my team's in a big fucking game, and they lose it, I have to keep it on. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, I can't.  Losing when it ended, though.  Huh?  Oh, no, I have to turn it off.  You have to turn it off immediately?  I got it.  I like to wallow.  I like to wallow.  Ah, no.  Wow, that was close.  That was close.  That was close.  It was amazing.  We were just watching the last play of the Hail Mary that Brady threw up in the end zone,  and that was close.  Could have been...  That could very well have just been, and the Patriots win.  I mean, it's easy to watch the play in slow motion to see what everyone should have done,  but what's his name there?  It kind of had a stutter step.  Oh, 87.  What's his name?  Yeah, because he was trying to figure out where that tip ball was going to go, but if he kept 
[00:08:00]  running full speed, it would have hit him in the fucking nose.  Yeah, it was...  I got to tell you this, you know, I always, I swear to you, I always thought Eli Manning  was overrated.  It's tough to say that now, in the last couple of years, but this fucking Eli Manning is  a ridiculously good quarterback, and at this point, better than his brother Peyton.  How many has Brady lost?  Two?  Brady lost two biggies.  Two to the Giants.  He's three to the Giants.  Yeah.  Brady's got three Super Bowls.  Eli Manning has two, and Peyton... 
[00:08:30]  Has one.  Has only one.  But that pass that Eli Manning completed, that's just, that's ridiculous.  That was such a key catch right there.  Ridiculous.  It had to be a perfect fucking throwing ball.  More than a catch, I would say.  It's more than a catch.  Dude, it was double coverage down the sideline.  Yeah.  And he made that pass.  And keeping his feet in like that, just amazing.  Manning is, I had to say, is great under pressure.  So is Brady.  But Manning is a great...  Like, look at the games this team won.  I hate the Giants.  I literally, I hope they all get some disease. 
[00:09:00]  They beat the fucking Packers, the 49ers on the road, and then they won this game.  Yeah.  They beat Dallas and Dallas.  Yeah, they didn't have an easy schedule.  God damn.  They had a real rough schedule to the Super Bowl.  Yeah, they were great.  Eli Manning is a fucking animal.  I got to officially say it.  Like I said, I always thought he was kind of, you know, it was all about Peyton.  Right.  And he was in his shadow, and then maybe he didn't deserve everything he got.  This guy deserves it all.  He's an unbelievable quarterback.  Holy fuck.  I can't take anything away from the guy. 
[00:09:30]  That was very cool.  After the game, I went online and did a quick wrap-up show on the compound, and I tried  to call up Bobby.  Called him up, and we were all in the studio there, just hammered, and his message comes  on.  It's like, leave a message after the beep.  And then we were just all going, just yelling, dead, dead, into his phone.  Look at this.  Here's that drop pass.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know the guy's number, but look, it's just, number 83, this is what did catch 
[00:10:00]  the cost of the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Because that would have been a new set of downs right there.  Yep.  Yep.  And then we...  Terrible.  We got a hold of Bill Burr, though.  Oh, you got Bill?  Yeah.  Bill answered his phone by saying, uh, yeah, which bandwagon jumper is this?  It's like, and he just went off, went off, uh, about what a, uh...  Well, where's this audio?  A know-nothing idiot I am.  I want this audio.  I didn't even have a chance to put it up online yet.  All right.  Uh, it was late last night, and, uh, I decided to really go to bed. 
[00:10:30]  I gotta tell you this, man.  Um, we joke about it, but this sports curse of mine is fucking creeping me out.  I was talking about that last night, too.  It's creeping me out.  The fact of the matter is, when, when you honestly want a team to win, and you're rooting  for him, uh, odds are they're gonna lose.  It's the, uh, it's the weirdest thing.  And people, like, think, ah, nice little stupid radio bit you got going.  No.  I, I, I mean, it'll take time.  But if these guys pulled audio from the last, uh, easily seven years, I have not picked a  Super Bowl winner.  And I, I don't even know the last team I picked to win. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  It's creepy.  Yeah, it really is.  It's a 50-50 chance without a point spread.  Yeah, not talking points or anything.  And I cannot pick the fucking team.  I'm gonna watch that catch.  The Pats, obviously.  That catch made, uh, whatever number 82 for the Giants was, was, what a fucking play,  man.  Yeah.  Oh, you, you, you got Bobby's angry voicemail from, uh, Super Bowl?  Yeah, from the last one.  Oh, that was the last one.  Well, it'll be the same this year, too.  Right, right.  True.  Did you enjoy the, um, halftime festivities? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, we'll talk about that in a minute.  Oh, God.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, that was.  Go ahead.  Where's the Bob Kelly thing?  Madonna.  I will not answer my phone for the next two weeks, and I will not listen to any messages.  Any messages will be deleted.  If you want to get in touch with me, call my house phone or send me an email, and, uh,  that's it.  So, no messages, no fucking answering the phone.  Don't even try.  It's not gonna happen.  Go fuck yourself.  I hope Tom Brady dies. 
[00:12:00]  Now, that's from the last Super Bowl.  That was the last Super Bowl.  How many years ago is that now?  That was 2008.  2008.  Okay.  Right, right, right, right.  So.  Dude.  I'm not answering the phone, dude.  Brady.  Barring a defensive foul.  The game ends here to the end zone.  Hernandez is there.  Tipped and batted.  Gronkowski can't get it.  Incomplete.  Isn't that sound?  And the New York Giants, given the last rights by many in December, are the Super Bowl champs 
[00:12:30]  in February.  That's pretty unbelievable.  It really is.  Congratulations to the Giants fans for real, man.  That's, that's unbelievable.  Thanks, man.  Oh.  Now, Michaels, you know, you gotta think he's a Giants fan.  Yeah.  You gotta think.  Do you?  Why?  I think he stationed in New York, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really was amazing because, yeah, halfway through the season, they were just another.  They were seven and seven.  Yeah.  They were seven and seven at one point.  Just another team in the. 
[00:13:00]  They were seven and fucking seven.  First nine and seven team to ever win, I think.  And then they started peaking at the right fucking time.  But.  Tebow was getting all the attention.  Huh?  Tebow was getting all the attention during the season.  Tebow who?  I know.  Yeah, exactly.  It's all about Eli Manning.  Yeah.  But why can't I pick a team?  I don't know.  It is frightening, isn't it?  Why can't I pick a team?  I really wanted the Pats to win.  I.  Huh?  That's why.  Because you really wanted them to win.  When you don't care either way and you pick a team, sometimes that team wins. 
[00:13:30]  But when you really want a team to win, it's just.  It's creepy.  It's bizarre.  It goes against mathematics.  Yeah.  It's a 50-50 shot.  I'm not even playing points.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just picking the winner.  Now, fuck the points or anything.  That's why people just should really vote against you and they'll make a fortune.  Do we have the MSNBC clip before we move on to the halftime show?  This.  We watch MSNBC.  Well, we watch MSNBC, Fox and CNN. 
[00:14:00]  A little, you know, cable news shit.  But the sound is MSNBC and it's fucking nauseating.  Well, you got Joe Scarborough, who, you know, you might not agree with him politically, but  he's a good broadcaster.  I like it.  I like how he does his show.  And he they they teamed him up with his blonde broad.  What is her name?  This fucking broad.  Yeah.  What's her name, though?  She's literally a mannequin.  She doesn't add anything to this fucking morning Joe show.  Why is she on it?  This is the show that replaced diamonds, by the way. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  There's rumors that there might be some nepotism or she might be dating someone or something  like that.  She is a horrendous broadcaster.  Has she always been there with him or she?  For a while.  Yeah.  I don't know how long, maybe since they they put Scarborough in the mornings.  He you could tell by his face he doesn't want to be doing it with her.  No.  And and also and everyone is talking about the Super Bowl.  If you're talking about anything else for the first hour of your show, you're stupid.  Yeah.  They had a real man's table to, you know, dumb Reverend Al is up there today. 
[00:15:00]  And then they got the guy from the way too early show.  He's at the table.  Scarborough.  It's just men and they're all talking about the Super Bowl.  Right.  And this bitch.  Well, she basically goes, are you guys done talking?  Because there's a lot of news to get to.  She goes, we're done with the Super Bowl because there's a lot of news to get to today.  You know, we had the vote in Nevada and it's it's really what could you just let the men  talk for a little while there, Francis. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And how about you get some coffee for the guys?  Yeah.  For the boys.  And then you can see Joe Scarborough's annoyed, but is she that out of touch that she doesn't  realize that people just want to hear, you know, Super Bowl talk for a little bit?  She's horrible.  This is how we got the clip.  Listen to this.  What a game.  It sounds like it was an incredible game.  She didn't even watch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She doesn't even know about it.  Why would she?  Why would she?  But I mean, I mean, yeah, there's people out there that don't watch the Super Bowl. 
[00:16:00]  Sure.  But if you're on TV or radio, you've got to watch the Super Bowl.  You have to.  She's doing a morning show with men.  You know, they're going to be talking about.  How about you at least know the basics of what happened?  Even if you don't want to, you have to.  You've got that type of a job.  She goes.  It sounds like.  Sounds like.  Which tells everybody she doesn't even know what happened.  Yeah.  What a game.  It sounds like it was an incredible game.  And you have no idea.  But your family are all big fans as well.  They were all screaming downstairs.  Yes.  Well, good.  And watching.  And apparently Madonna. 
[00:16:30]  Downstairs.  So she doesn't even, like, join her family?  Frigid Monster was upstairs looking at her underused bed.  And her collection of fucking dusty sex toys.  Oh, God.  She's upstairs.  And apparently Madonna was quite good.  Did you see Madonna?  No, I didn't.  I'm sorry.  We have a lot of news.  How do you not watch Madonna?  She did nothing.  Just to see what that was going to be all about.  Right.  Right.  You're talking about. 
[00:17:00]  You're talking about an event that is watched by.  They say a billion.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But it's a billion.  Five hundred and something.  There's millions after the billion, by the way.  But they rounded off to a billion at this point.  And now listen to her try to.  Yeah.  Like, since she doesn't know anything about it.  She's going to try to change the fucking subject.  Right.  It's the Super Bowl.  Right.  It's Mika.  Mika.  Mika.  Brzezinski.  Brzezinski. 
[00:17:30]  She's literally the worst on TV.  She has absolutely nothing.  Nothing to add.  Apparently Madonna was quite good.  Did you see Madonna?  No, I didn't.  I'm sorry.  We have a lot of news to cover this morning.  She was really good.  Was she good?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Okay.  You like Madonna?  She was great.  No, really?  So, Madonna reverence?  She was good.  I saw something at the end of your show.  Well, that wasn't her fault.  That was not good.  Okay.  Can we get to the news now?  There's so much.  We've gotten involved.  Can we get to the news now?  That is the news. 
[00:18:00]  Like, are you guys done talking about this silly Super Bowl thing?  And you don't have to be a huge sports fan in order to just know that it was a big game.  It was watched by a lot of people.  I think it's going to be record-setting.  Well, the key about the Super Bowl, which she's too stupid to realize, it's, you know,  a shitload of sports fans, obviously.  Yeah.  But then you got, like, with the commercials and the halftime show, there's a whole pop  culture thing happening.  Yeah.  It runs the gamut.  And just so we're clear here, the guys were talking about the Super Bowl for maybe two minutes 
[00:18:30]  before she chimed in with this shit.  They weren't going for an hour.  No.  And then she chimes in.  It's just two minutes.  Okay.  Can we get to the news now?  There's so much.  We've got Nevada to cover.  We have Iran to talk about.  Nevada to cover?  New King Ranch goes on in an incredible display of lack of self-awareness.  It's also good.  It's exactly what she's displaying.  Yes.  A lack of self-awareness.  Can you believe she fucking threw a monkey wrench right into the men's conversation? 
[00:19:00]  Hey, dame.  Hey, dame.  How about you leave the men to talk for a little while?  To talk about Newt Gingrich?  That's status quo shit.  There's nothing going on there.  No, there's no news there.  Fuck who cares?  Mitt Romney's doing his thing and Newt's just kind of sitting there.  There's nothing to talk about with that.  It certainly shouldn't have interrupted the Super Bowl talk after two minutes.  That's for sure.  Get some coffee for the men.  Self-awareness.  It's also good.  Anything you want?  No, I'm good.  Can I move on?  Go ahead.  Are you sure? 
[00:19:30]  I don't get Madonna, but go ahead.  That's one more thing about the Super Bowl.  Not enough cutaways of Giselle, I would argue.  She must have hated that, too.  He's like, not enough cutaways of Giselle.  You know, the hot bitch that you're not.  She goes, oh, what?  Yeah, what?  Oh, my God.  Oh, we got to talk about Newt.  That's why she's there, though.  To the ladies' opinion.  Right.  Get the ladies' opinion in there.  That was real good how you shut the guys down and made them not talk about the Super Bowl. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, and got to Nevada.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Is that unbelievable?  Terrible.  Fucking horrible.  Over a billion people have their TVs tuned in to the fucking Super Bowl.  Yeah.  And you don't even bother to watch.  You're upstairs as your family's enjoying the game, and you're on, like, one of these big cable networks?  Yeah.  Then shut your fucking mouth and let these guys do that part of the show.  How adorable was the Puppy Bowl?  I didn't see the Puppy Bowl.  I didn't either.  Oh, my God.  What channel was that on?  I had it on. 
[00:20:30]  Can we move on with the news, Ant?  It was on the food channel in Korea.  Are you done with the Puppy Bowl?  Well, one more thing about the Puppy Bowl.  The Kitty Halftime Show was adorable.  Just, they take a bunch of kittens.  They put them on this whole thing that's just motorized cat toys, and they're just pawing at each other in the cat toys.  It was adorable.  It was wonderful, huh?  Oh, my God.  Just adorable.  What channel was the Puppy Bowl on? 
[00:21:00]  I don't know.  I saw you tweeting about it.  I'm like, fuck, where is this Puppy Bowl?  Oh, it was Animal Planet.  Oh.  It's on Animal Planet.  And then I felt bad for the guy that has to ref the Puppy Bowl.  There's actually a guy in a referee outfit with a whistle, and he's probably thinking, yeah, this is my break.  I can't wait until this gets on IMDb.  Why are the dogs so big compared to the field?  I don't know, Jimmy.  They really should have had a bigger field.  I was thinking Michael Vick should have refed it.  That would have been funny.  They should have used an NFL field. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, a real NFL field.  How boring, but it's Texas Stadium.  Right.  Just dogs running around the field.  Just the dogs in Texas Stadium.  They keep them confined, so they have to bite each other and jump.  But look at them.  We're watching little clips.  They're taking the little footballs and toys over the goal line.  This looks horrendous.  Did you really enjoy this?  No.  Okay.  It's terrible.  I will say, though, they are adorable.  Of course they are.  Oh, they're puppies.  But after two minutes, you're just like, okay.  Enough already?  Enough of the puppy bowl. 
[00:22:00]  Why don't they do lingerie bowl as a halftime thing somewhere?  They do.  They should.  They do?  Where?  MTV 2.  Fuck.  Where are these channels?  Where's MTV 2?  I must say, the second you start getting bored with the puppy bowl after like two minutes,  though, they do switch to the water bowl camera, which is a glass bottom bowl with a camera  on it.  So when they go to drink, you get a close-up view of their face.  It's the cutest thing I've ever seen. 
[00:22:30]  I tweeted that.  It made me forget that I'm a horrible, miserable racist.  Damn it.  I was about to say, does it warm your racist heart?  Yes, it did.  You beat me to it.  I was sitting there just going, oh, some things in this world are adorable and nice.  Well, I guess a lot of people are going to praise Madonna's halftime show, but I thought  it was horrendous.  Terrible.  I thought it was horrible.  I hate the lip-syncing bullshit.  Yeah.  First of all, to start there.  Did McCartney or Bruce Springsteen lip-syncing?  I don't think they did.  I don't think McCartney did. 
[00:23:00]  No, no.  I'm sure there's probably parts of it you got to lip-sync, maybe, but that whole thing  was lip-synced.  And the broad can't move anymore.  She's known for her yoga and staying in shape.  She was like, she looked like she was stiff.  She needed a little Boniva.  Boniva or something, right?  Maybe she needed some Boniva.  It was just a boring, what bothered me is the songs weren't, it was not a great selection  of songs.  No, man.  And what I didn't like was the giant, there was no audience right around her.  That's what usually you have at the Super Bowl.  Oh, right, right.  It was a giant production.  Right.  Whereas Springsteen had people in front of him, McCartney had an audience around him. 
[00:23:30]  She should have had an audience around her.  But I thought it was just boring and poorly choreographed.  And Madonna has so many fucking hits.  Why aren't you keeping it fast-paced?  It was like a medium tempo, basically, to the whole thing.  It was really, the entrance was good.  I understand why she came out like that.  What pomp and circumstance, huh?  Yeah, I mean, she's Madonna.  She came out like a fucking, you know, whatever.  A bunch of Roman war helmets.  I hated how she came out, because it's the Super Bowl, but Madonna wanted to make it about 
[00:24:00]  me.  It is really big.  Here's me.  She's dressed like Caligula.  But the problem was they didn't allow fans on.  They should have had people on the fucking.  Absolutely.  Because I didn't want to see this big, dumb production.  Look, this is how.  They're playing a record.  But listen, that's like just medium tempo shit.  They are playing a record.  And look how she moves.  She's not moving at all.  This lip syncing does.  If you can't sing live, they should not book you to sing at the fucking Super Bowl.  I completely agree. 
[00:24:30]  God, it stinks.  At one point, she's just rolling around.  I'm like, what is that?  What is that?  It's not a dance thing.  It's uninspired.  She's dressed like Thor, lip syncing.  That is.  Wow.  She's doing Vogue, which is a really old song.  Well, it's kind of a montage, I guess.  Yeah.  No, I know, but she's starting with the Vogue.  There was nothing alive about it.  It was just really dull. 
[00:25:00]  She can't sing like this.  Those stupid bleacher steps she had, she almost fell down.  Oh, I know.  She almost fell.  You know who would have fucking blown a hole through the fucking roof?  Lady Gaga.  Would have A, sang live, and fucking blown Madonna away.  Stupid Lady Gaga in her costumes, but Madonna made Lady Gaga look like a fucking, not that  she needed a superstar.  Like, Lady Gaga blows her away as far as performance goes.  Even though she does take a lot from Madonna, she would have sang it live.  Look at her, who the fuck wants to see lip syncing? 
[00:25:30]  That's terrible.  And why this song?  Look at the dancing, they're all, it's awful.  Look at her, she's not even dancing?  Her outfit fucking stinks with that cape.  She's like Elvis in 68.  Yeah, she's extremely out of touch.  Wow.  I think she's out of touch.  She's out of touch with how unenjoyable this would be.  Right.  You're right.  No one could tell her, like, look, do some hits, do this. 
[00:26:00]  Well, it's a hit.  No, no, but after this, there wasn't, I didn't know what the next song was.  Well, she had to play her new song, what is it, give me some lovin' or lovin' something.  That's what people want to hear.  Because McCartney sang, oh, no, that's right, he sang Get Back.  That's right, McCartney didn't do that.  That's the stupid deal she probably made.  I'll do your silly Super Bowl if you let me do my latest song.  How about they just book the Stones again?  Yeah.  You like this, Sam?  You like the pop.  No. 
[00:26:30]  This isn't that bad.  No.  This is new?  No, this isn't the new song.  This came out years ago.  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, I know that, but, I mean, did you like the performance?  No, I mean, it wasn't.  Look at the bleachers.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  She's lost on bleachers.  What the fuck are you doing?  Where are you?  You can't be a pop star at that age.  Oh, she's falling down.  Did you see?  She couldn't even get back up.  You're right.  You shouldn't be a pop star.  Like, Bruce and McCartney are doing, like, that's what they do. 
[00:27:00]  Like, they're not trying to pull off being younger or something.  Yeah.  But she could have sang her songs live.  Her voice is still good.  Like, she didn't have to do all this performance.  She just got up there and sang her songs.  But she's known for keeping herself in ridiculous shape.  Don't you feel like she's going to get hurt when this guy's whipping her around?  But look at how awkward this is on bleachers.  It's just a terribly choreographed, giant stage.  You didn't need all that shit.  And it sounds like they're pumping in crowd noise, too.  Of course they are.  No one's cheering this. 
[00:27:30]  No, they're all taking a piss.  Look at this.  What the hell is that?  It's a fucking guy hovering on something on a wire.  Sure, that's a guy.  It's on a wire.  Oh, whatever it is.  Yes.  It's not a guy from fame.  Oh, my God.  The high wire act.  Oh, it's Sam on the tightrope.  Yeah, I got a lot of tweets.  Is this Sirk Piss on the tightrope?  You know what proves he's not a guy?  No one can take a ball powder on your cock and ass taint like that.  That's not a guy.  What's wrong with him?  What guy can handle that?  What is this mess? 
[00:28:00]  She should have been front and center with an audience around her.  It's very slow.  It really is terrible.  And then at one point she's making like Molly Shannon moves on the stage.  Just rolling around like I don't even know what it was.  You're right.  She's out of touch.  She's 54.  Look, she looks amazing for 53.  But she's been so isolated for so long that.  And then she had to bring in all these like.  Yeah.  Who are those?  Who are the cameras?  Nicki Minaj.  LMFAO, CeeLo, Nicki Minaj, and MIA.  MIA with the finger, huh?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  That annoys me.  Because Janet Jackson's tit popping is one thing.  But if MIA, what is that?  The angry, you're a rebel move?  If you think you're too hip to do the gig, don't take the fucking gig, sweetheart.  Don't do it.  That's true.  If you're going to say fuck you on live TV on purpose, then don't take the gig.  Kind of smart, though.  Everyone's talking about MIA.  You're right.  They are.  That's true.  So.  That is true.  But I see your point.  Is that them?  LMFAO?  That's LMFAO.  Are those the party guys?  Those are the party guys that you hate.  Those douchebags.  I like them.  Their shit is catchy, Jimmy. 
[00:29:00]  You got to admit.  It is.  Especially if they lip sync it.  Why would they sing it live?  Yeah.  You can't sing that shit.  They'll put the guys in the tap out.  Look, see, this is what I meant.  What is she doing?  Oh, God.  I know it's a visual, though.  I'm sexy and I know it.  Yeah, you are sexy, but you're fucking litter.  She's lost behind dancers.  What are you looking old lady fucking doddering around up there?  What are you doing?  She looks like me at a party.  Just kind of lost with people around, confused.  The fuck are you doing, Madge? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, shit.  This is my new thing.  Are we out of touch?  No.  What are they saying about this halftime show?  I like to try to see different angles at this point.  Madonna's new song is getting trashed.  Like, Madonna's the one who's out of touch.  But, I mean, her performance.  Good reviews.  She's got pom-poms.  Mediocre reviews.  She's 53 with pom-poms.  With pom-poms.  Is this her new song?  This is the new one, right?  Oh, thank God.  Is this, is this, oh, Mickey, you're so fine?  Yes.  I was about to say.  Tony Basil, right?  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, Mickey, you're so cryptic.  I've had enough of Nicki Minaj.  She's a good, but ever since I heard she was a cunt, I have no desire to look at her.  Yeah.  Dumb fucking rhyme scheme.  Fuck her.  Pretty impressive.  White wig.  You see that one song, how she raps?  She looks like one of the X-Men.  I'm tired of her.  Fuck her.  Fuck Nicki Minaj.  She's in a car or something, and the video goes by like a fucking, like, fucking rocket.  Lady Gaga should have done this gig.  I thought.  Believe me, that's the, I know it's not like a fruit. 
[00:30:30]  I kept saying at my party, Lady Gaga's coming out at any moment.  Oh.  Madonna wouldn't let that happen.  No, of course not.  I don't think Gaga would do that either.  Oh, yes, she would.  She wouldn't come out on the show?  I don't think so.  I don't know if anybody would refuse Madonna.  Nah, but look at Nicki Minaj is massive.  Not like, not like Gaga.  That's true.  I don't know, man.  I can't picture any performer saying no to being with, in front of a billion people in  a Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Like, if they would have came out and they said, well, you dance like Madonna is right 
[00:31:00]  now, where the two, the two knees are opening and your hands are shuffling back and forth.  Like the Charleston.  But that's what it looked like Madonna was doing.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  This stinks, the song, the stage.  They're just walking around putting their feet up where they want.  Do they talk this over?  What do they do?  Do they just meet and the things?  They just follow my lead.  All right, what do I do?  There's a lot of stuff up there.  Put your feet up when you want.  Yeah, just walk around, cover Madonna.  Al Roker's going to come out in a fucking gown.  We're all going to lip sync together.  Oh, good. 
[00:31:30]  I'd love to see him.  I think if you're doing the halftime show, you've got to have that just high energy the  entire fucking time, man.  This is why fucking McCartney, and I don't mean to keep harping on him.  It was him and his band and a piano, and he fucking was awesome.  Springsteen.  Plays to a stadium of people.  Oh, right?  And it was amazing.  Tom Petty.  Oh, yeah, I forgot the Who did it.  Tom Petty.  That stupid running down a dream I still got from watching the Super Bowl, and I listened  to it.  Running Down a Dream is a great song.  Who else could they have had? 
[00:32:00]  No, it's a great song.  Lady Gaga.  At this point, Lady Gaga.  Yeah, she could pull off by herself.  Without a doubt.  Oh, fuck yeah.  She didn't have anything new to promote.  Oh, maybe.  But you don't have to.  Yeah.  It's a great hits album.  You're in front of a billion people.  Just get out there.  Just promote your stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, what is this?  Marching band?  What is this?  Tusk?  So I was trashing her on Twitter, and people were like, oh, you don't like anything.  But it's like, no, I actually like Madonna.  I don't hate Madonna.  I don't think it's hip to hate Madonna.  I just thought this was uninspired and terrible. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, I saw that tweet.  I like the game.  I think all the nonsense that goes around it is so easy to make fun of.  Yeah.  So easy.  Oh, this is when CeeLo came out?  Yeah.  He's good, too, but here?  I thought that was Al Roker.  Dumb Tim Manhattan.  Oh, does he look silly?  Lip syncing.  Big fat queen.  See, it's still just there.  Is she singing there, though?  I thought she was singing here.  Yeah, I thought she might be, too. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, that's like tripled and quadrupled vocal.  Maybe.  And then they had to go with the message, right?  Wasn't there a message about world peace or something?  Oh, yeah.  A straight message at the end.  Something about world peace?  Yeah.  Right.  She couldn't fit laugh, and the world laughs with you.  So she went with world peace.  Fucking beauty queen in 1950.  Oh.  It's a good song.  It is, but it's all just mellow, man.  Yeah.  I mean, this kicks in after a while, but... 
[00:33:30]  How about you just go right to the part where it kicks in?  Is she lip syncing here?  That's right.  It looks like...  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  When it's not the actual version that they have recorded...  They probably pre-recorded it.  Yeah, they pre-recorded it in a studio, make it all nice.  But why are you so far from the audience?  Because she's scared.  What song is this?  It's a good song.  Like a prayer.  Like a prayer, yeah.  She's good.  Oh, that's lifting them up on some type of elevated device. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  And she looks amazing for 53.  She looks great.  But to be so far, just put the fucking audience from you and belt out a few tunes and shut  your fucking hole.  Yeah, the whole performance thing is...  It was too much, dude.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  She needs to, like, move on to the next...  The next level.  The next level and not jump around like she's fucking a pop star.  It's not the same deal anymore.  It's silly with all the dances and the pom-poms and her, you know, looking like she's going 
[00:34:30]  to hurt herself.  Can we see a...  She really did.  Yeah, it really did.  Did she pull her back out?  Yeah.  I just want to see Sir Paul for a second.  Sir Paul.  Because you remember he had the...  Even though I didn't like Steven Van Zandt going, it's bruise time!  And throwing up the ref flag.  Like, oh.  Ah, yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I disagree that she looks great, by the way.  Oh, for 53?  Her face is made to look really good when she's on a stage.  But when she's off the stage, it is creepy looking.  Yeah.  Who's this?  Marco from Yonkers. 
[00:35:00]  Who is it?  Oh, Marco.  What's up, Marco?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, they gave a commercial beforehand where her and Jay Leno on the elevator.  Yep, yeah.  And her face looks swollen.  And you can see the lines under her cheek.  Like, it looks really disgusting.  I didn't even know it was her at first.  Yeah, she's got, like, really big cheeks.  I guess there's implants or a lot of Botox or something in there.  And it's creepy to look at, but it's made so when she's on stage, it looks great from  a distance.  Yeah, and I was going to say, I was watching the show with, like, five girls, and every 
[00:35:30]  single girl was sticking up for her.  Oh, no, she looks great.  No, no, no.  Yeah, man, yeah.  Her body's, I mean, her body was great, but her face is, oh, it's a wreck.  But my problem is, she's a performer.  She was moving around very gingerly on that stage.  Yeah.  She was doing the flip.  Maybe she pulled her clit or something before.  Yeah, everything was slow motion.  You're right.  All those things that were supposed to be, you know, very artistic and acrobatic, they  were all done in slow motion.  Yeah, what was...  Those guys that were flipping her around. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  Like, we're doing it really slowly.  I mean, you've gone to the gym since you were whatever.  Yeah.  You should be able to move.  I don't know.  And 53 is not that old for someone that's keeping in shape like that.  Well, to be jumping around like a pop star on stage.  It is silly.  Here's Sir Parley.  Sir Parley.  He's just belting it out.  His band.  His fucking audience around him. 
[00:36:30]  That's it.  Sounds great.  That's it.  I guess it's nice when you have the Beatles library to choose from.  Yeah.  But I mean, he's just up doing his guitar.  And he's trying to smash his guitar or jumping on amps.  And Martin thought she was a woman.  But she was another man.  Totally fucking live.  Yes.  I said she got it coming.  But she gets it down. 
[00:37:00]  She cares.  So get back.  What year is he there?  Get back.  Jesus, that's just not good.  Get back to where you want to belong.  Get back.  Get back.  Straight.  Yeah.  Get back to where you want to belong.  Get back.  There's no fucking way he's lip syncing.  No.  That's so funny, though.  Yeah.  He's got the Beatles.  Because you can feel that he's attached to the audience.  When you lip sync, there's a...  You're detached.  You're detached.  And he's surrounded by fans right there. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  And comedians can't...  I kind of resent singers because they...  I know that their voices have to be a certain way and comics don't.  But they can ride the same fucking few songs.  Oh, yeah.  And then lip sync.  Right.  Yeah.  The lip syncing drives me nuts.  That would be really silly to do as a comic.  It would be ludicrous.  It would be ludicrous.  Imagine that, you know.  Play one of your albums and just lip sync to it.  Bobby's got some info on the Madonna thing and why she was moving around so slowly.  Dude.  Yes, Bobby. 
[00:38:00]  I stepped on her foot, dude.  Go Giants.  Fia.  Yeah, she pulled a hamstring a couple days ago doing the practice.  Oh, yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah, she...  It would make sense because...  She did a commercial with...  And said...  Told Groski that he better get his ass out there and play.  If she's going to do it with a hamstring, he can play with a sprained ankle.  Maybe that was just the commercial.  Pulled a hammy?  Yeah, she did.  She pulled a hammy?  That makes a lot of sense because I was thinking there's no way she's... 
[00:38:30]  But at that age, you shouldn't be doing a performance where you might pull a hamstring.  Where you might pull a hamstring.  Right.  You're right.  Because she's that age.  Nobody...  A young person doesn't pull a hamstring.  Well, that explains a lot.  So she probably would have moved a little better without the hamstring injury.  But she still picked a very, like...  I don't know.  Mellow set in general.  She's too old.  She's not, like, a young pop star.  She's not, you know...  Well, there's no one else they could get.  Who else could they get?  Just change her performance a little bit.  They're pretty much running out of people to get for the Super Bowl. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  They really are.  True.  Yeah, those huge names.  It has to be a mega star.  It's got to be huge.  Yeah, you can't just...  A mega known by the world star.  We're running out of those, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, who else do you get, really?  Think about it.  They've had just about everyone you can think of.  Yeah.  They had U2 one year, right?  Yeah.  So they had the Stones, U2, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCarty, Madonna.  Who's left?  Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi.  He might fall short of mega fucking stardom. 
[00:39:30]  You have to be doing it.  Maybe when they're in New York.  Slightly fall short of that shit.  Bon Jovi?  Oh, he could do that.  You think?  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah, Bon Jovi's a fucking big man.  Yeah, I think Bon Jovi could do that.  He's an arena act.  He could pull off...  All right, let's get Bon Jovi for next year.  I think you're right.  Let's get on that, people.  Book it.  Let's do that.  Yeah, book it.  Do they have any black...  I'm sure they have, but who have they had that's...  Do they have any black performers?  I don't know if they've ever had just one.  Besides Janet Jackson.  Oh, they had Prince?  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  He rocks telling me?  Okay, that's right.  Tells me in my ear instead of just throwing a mic out.  I don't give a fuck who talks. 
[00:40:00]  Why are you telling me?  Who cares?  I didn't want to interrupt.  They did have Prince?  Yeah.  Remember he did the ballet gestures with his guitar?  Oh, right.  Controversy?  Yes, yes.  M.I.  They had black eyed peas last year.  Huh?  Yeah.  They had black eyed peas last year.  Black eyed peas, yeah.  Wait, black eyed peas was last year, right?  Yeah, with Fergie.  With Slash, too.  Fergie.  Oh, Slash.  Fergie.  And Usher.  Yeah, Usher and Fergie.  That was black eyed peas I liked.  The Who.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  And then Janet Jackson, the biggest one.  Bruce.  Oh, yeah.  That's not the biggest one.  The biggest controversy, but not the biggest Super Bowl halftime show.  Kiss has done it.  The Stones have done it.  Fucking...  The Stones.  Who did it back in 1994?  I actually know that.  94?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I believe.  I'm going to see some of these.  It was country music.  Yeah, really?  Don't wait.  Hold on.  Let me guess.  I know who it was.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Get ACDC.  They would never...  The NFL would never do that, but you want a halftime show? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, you could do a little Thunderstruck?  Are you kidding me?  The NFL might...  Why wouldn't they do it?  I mean, they want...  Get AC...  Fuck Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi's going to have to wait, NFL.  Oh, boy.  Get on it.  We want ACDC next year.  They are one of the biggest selling bands on Earth.  Thank you, Eric in Alabama.  I say they say.  AC fucking...  Can you imagine?  You shook me all night long, Thunderstruck, and maybe...  What else will we throw in there?  You got to go with the hits, boys.  Yeah.  Back in black.  Back in black.  Huge.  Gotta go.  You shook me.  You have to. 
[00:41:30]  Maybe.  And Thunderstruck is such a great fucking crowd song.  That would be my turn.  That would be huge, yeah.  Maybe Hell's Bells just to get them on stage.  You hear those bells going.  Yeah.  Oh, a place would go bullshit, right?  They would go bullshit.  Who was 97?  Or 94, I guess.  94 was Clint Black, Tanya Tucker, Travis Tritt, and the Judds.  A lot of country.  Wow.  That must have been terrific.  Rocking country Sunday.  That must have been terrific.  Faith Hill was great.  Singing that fucking horrendous song about the Super Bowl. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, it stunk.  They got to squeeze in the words.  It was terrible.  95 was my favorite.  The Indiana Jones stunt spectacular.  Oh, shit.  Patti LaBelle and Teddy Pentagrass.  That was 95?  Tony Pentagrass.  I remember watching that.  I don't know what's going on.  What is this?  I don't remember that.  You don't?  No, I really don't.  They were, like, promoting their big Indiana Jones attraction at Disney World.  Oh, my God.  So they did the Indiana Jones stunt show for the halftime show. 
[00:42:30]  That was retarded.  And it was the same thing that you see in those little 100-person theaters or whatever in Disney World when you go to see the stunt show.  Yeah, yeah.  But at the Super Bowl.  I don't remember that.  Oh, man.  It had a storyline and everything.  It was like a little mini movie where there's a voiceover as the guy's moving around all dramatically.  And you're like, all right, I'll go in.  And he's not really talking.  Like, it's the attraction.  Yeah, exactly.  Michael Jackson did it in 92.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Fuck it, ACDC.  93.  Get ACDC.  They're known all over the world.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Wow.  Food's here.  All right.  You know what?  Why don't we do this?  We're going to take a break.  Oh, boy.  We're going to continue talking about the Super Bowl.  I want to get a lot of phone calls in.  We should move on to other news.  See what the people are talking.  A lot of very excited Giants fans.  And in the end, I congratulate you fuckers.  Eli Manning is an animal. 
[00:43:30]  Period.  He's a fucking animal.  That's amazing.  I want to change.  From now on, no one calls me Jim Norton.  I'm Michael Carter.  Ah, yeah.  Oh, did you read that?  I want to be called Michael Carter.  Michael Carter.  From now on.  Just call me Michael Carter.  Are we going to explain next, hopefully?  That's the new me.  Yeah.  What a dirty boy.  And I want to say thank you to the people who showed up at Bananas this weekend.  How was it?  My worst weekend there ever as far as attendance is concerned. 
[00:44:00]  Saturday was good.  Friday was horrendous.  But the crowds that came were phenomenal.  Yeah.  I mean phenomenal.  I think leading up to the Super Bowl, people just saved their money and saved their fucking heads.  I'd like to believe that.  They chill out a little bit.  No.  If they wanted to come, they'd come.  They didn't want to come.  I know.  There was a light crowd at Governors, too.  I went to see Voss.  Yeah.  They were Governors.  And, yeah.  But I don't know what his history is there.  My history at Bananas is fantastic.  Yeah.  And it just, I want to cancel New York gigs. 
[00:44:30]  I'm so fucking, really.  Jimmy.  Ugh.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  Fuck New York.  Oh, boy.  But Michael Powers will be doing some gigs.  Yes.  Michael Powers.  Carter.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, Powers is the other guy.  Powers is the other guy.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what this is about.  It's dirty.  Michael Carter.  It's dirty.  Mike Carter coming up wearing a 4711.  Yeah.  I want to smell like some 4711 cologne.  Could you guys explain this to me?  And not having to fucking play a game or anything. 
[00:45:00]  No bullshit.  Just, hey, here I am.  No bullshit.  No bullshitting around.  No bullshit.  Five minutes after Hello.  He'll sit on the edge of the bed.  Let me put my hand on your tits.  Yeah.  Let me fucking unbutton your shirt and put my hand on your tits.  This is fantastic.  Michael Carter will call you.  Yes.  You'll be picked up at the airport.  You'll come, hop in the pool.  We'll bathe because I sweat a lot and then we'll fuck.  And then we're fucking.  What do you think of them apples?  And if I say so, you're going to blow my friend. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  And do some poppers.  Yeah.  My friend looks tense.  Suck his cock.  Amazing.  And here's a song.  Listen to the words.  Yeah.  I'm a cheese dick too.  Yeah.  Are we going to explain next?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, good.  I'm Michael Carter.  Fantastic.  I'm so out of this one.  Fantastic.  Sirius Connection.  Sirius Connection.  The OP DL3 Show.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS. 
[00:46:00]  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here.  It isn't clear.  But what we're certain of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  But full-blown AIDS.  Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS. 
[00:46:30]  I'm sorry, I wish it was something less serious.  But it's AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  All right.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  Getting a little edgy there, I see.  Wow, really?  A little edgy. 
[00:47:00]  Not too politically correct, I think.  No, no, no, no.  But accurate.  On your segment.  Yes.  We were hoping you were going to do Guns N' Roses for Axel's 50th birthday today.  But we're going to let you slide because you got a little edgy there.  Yeah.  Looks like what?  What happened?  I know what it is, so I'm not even going to guess.  I looked.  You looked?  Yeah, I looked.  Someone died of AIDS, I guess?  Well, Arthur Ashe died 19 years ago at the age of 49.  19 years ago.  It was 19 fucking years ago. 
[00:47:30]  19 years ago.  He would only be 68.  That sucks.  19 fucking years ago.  19 years.  Good old Arthur Ashe.  What, a blood transfusion?  Yep.  From open heart surgery.  Open heart surgery.  Really?  Thanks for nothing.  Jesus.  Oh, I thought he was, you know.  No, man.  No, man.  He got the fucking.  Oh, man.  Hit a little heart action and, yeah.  Those people got the bad batch of blood before they started looking into that stuff, huh? 
[00:48:00]  Yep.  Man.  Axel 50, Zsa Zsa Gabor 95.  She's still alive with, like, pieces of herself.  Well, it's actually a head and elbow.  Yeah.  And one of her ears is left.  She's actually in three different places in the house.  You think she could enjoy a movie?  No.  She's not enjoying anything.  Yeah.  I think if you're, like, just kind of bedridden, maybe you get to watch some cool movies at  least.  No?  Everybody was counting her out fucking, like, years ago already. 
[00:48:30]  Like, oh, she ain't going to last another fucking week.  That's no way to live.  If you can still enjoy movies, then, yes, it's worth living, but.  Mm.  All right.  Aaron Rodgers named NFL MVP.  Oh.  I was thinking Super Bowl MVP.  I was ready to go, what?  What?  We didn't really talk about the commercials.  The commercials, Super Bowl commercials, it's getting really strange now, because they 
[00:49:00]  release them before the Super Bowl.  They're online.  Everybody sees them beforehand, so they're not these big, like, oh, I didn't see that.  You know?  For many years when we were growing up, Super Bowl commercials, you saw it as a nation  for the first time together.  Yeah.  That's what made it so cool.  Yeah.  Now you've seen them before.  We all saw Jerry's beforehand.  That shared experience is going away because it's on demand, obviously.  Yeah.  But, I mean, is it that big of a deal if you get to see the commercials ahead of time?  No.  Then it doesn't become this big, special thing. 
[00:49:30]  It's just another commercial that you've seen.  What stood out for you?  Well, I liked Clint Eastwood.  And that voice of his.  What happened?  I love that voice of his.  Do you?  I really do.  It just looks like it's painful for him to talk.  It just seems like it hurts.  I think he gets the number one spot, though.  The teams are in their locker room.  Discussing what?  The teams are in their locker room.  I heard it, but I didn't see it.  I was downstairs.  Hugging Bob.  It's halftime.  It's halftime. 
[00:50:00]  Both teams are in their locker room discussing what they can do to win this game.  How does he know?  Oh.  Maybe they're just taking shit, son.  It's halftime in America, too.  Is it?  People are out of work.  Can we change the team, then?  They're all wondering what they're going to do to win this game.  By the way, this is an Obama commercial.  And we're all scared because this isn't a game.  Gotta think.  Yeah.  The people of Detroit know a little something about this.  No, he's a Republican, Clinton.  They almost lost everything.  Clinton.  Clinton, yeah.  Paid for Mitt Romney.  But we all pulled together.  Bye.  Now Motor City is fighting again. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, it's fighting, all right, in the streets.  I've seen a lot of tough errors.  A lot of downturns in my life.  It's so cold in the day.  It seems that we've lost our heart at times.  The fog, division, discord, and blame.  This proves the Jay Moore impression is right on.  Oh, yeah.  The famous Jay Moore story with Clint Eastwood.  Boom!  Yeah, Clint Eastwood's impression has changed over the years.  Remember when it was, okay, punk?  When you just had to say that? 
[00:51:00]  Because that's what we do.  We find a way through tough times, and if we can't find a way, then we'll make one.  Boom!  This is inspirational.  What's this for?  All that matters now is...  It's for, uh, I don't know.  That's the problem.  I don't know.  It's just for Clint.  If you ask me right now, I would say I don't know why.  I think it's a Chrysler commercial.  Well, how about you have the logo on the screen for the whole time?  Yeah.  For Detroit coming back.  Because you have to sit through two minutes of this just to find out what the commercial's about.  What the fuck is this commercial even about? 
[00:51:30]  I don't know.  I really don't know.  What is it about?  Is it about, uh, Detroit in general?  Detroit, uh, yeah.  It's kind of the spirit of America, the car industry.  Spirit of America paid for by who?  And Chrysler.  Is it Chrysler?  Yeah.  Why not Ford?  Ford from Detroit.  Oh, it's true.  They all chipped in.  What's that for?  Hey, I got a Jeep.  Well, those are all...  That commercial was for me.  Those are all, uh, Chrysler products.  It was for people that don't have Jeeps.  Oh, oh.  It was actually for everyone but you, because you have one. 
[00:52:00]  You're already paid for.  So that commercial was a waste of time for me.  For you, it was totally.  Oh.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Mm.  Mm.  Hey.  Mm.  Ow.  Someone have a lozenge?  Yeah.  I'm hurting.  It's got to make my day or something, right?  Ah, Chip.  What was the Mean Joe Green commercial?  I saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I'm like,  For a softener or something?  Fuck, why didn't I watch this?  Fabric softener or something?  But he's an old guy now, right?  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  It's the whole takeoff on him throwing the shirt?  I guess.  Yeah, but I missed it.  But of course, he didn't have a Steelers jersey this time.  Why?  Why would he, you know?  Because the Steelers probably wouldn't allow him.  Why?  They would sue the old guy?  Yeah.  Probably.  Jesus.  Did you find that commercial?  Was it good?  Is that it?  I don't know.  Mean Joe Green.  Downey.  Fabric.  Mr. Green.  Mr. Green.  Yeah.  Look at all this.  By Downey Unstoppables.  Laundry smells good for a long time.  Oh, boy.  Really? 
[00:53:00]  You can have it.  Take it, Joe.  See you around.  Hey, kid.  Catch.  Wow.  No thanks, Mean Joe.  Last time I'm doing this.  No, that's all right.  All right.  That's nostalgia.  Why do they do it with the old broad?  What's the significance of that?  I guess because, you know, she's a house frow that knows about fabrics.  Oh, and those broads know how to wash shit. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, those broads can wash a fucking jersey.  They can wash out shit stains.  They're the best of them.  They can wash.  Wash and wash.  Got to get a washer.  I like the new thing Clorox is doing with their ads.  What?  It's about kids shitting in various places and how you need, like, Clorox to clean it up.  Well, it happens, Ant.  They're shitting in the bathtub.  They're shitting on the floor, shitting in the car, shitting their pants.  It happens.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know.  They like to finger paint after a while.  Fuck me.  I think I told the story on the after show, but really quickly, it happened to me. 
[00:54:00]  I'm giving my son a bath, right?  And I'm fucking tweeting, doing everything but paying attention to him in the bathtub.  Uh-oh.  And he has a tendency to try to get my attention, so he'll throw something at me.  Oh, no.  You didn't hear this?  No way.  So he throws something.  I'm like, oh, fuck, a toy.  All right.  I get the hand.  I put my phone down so I could pay a little attention to him.  Turns out it was a turd.  He threw shit at you.  You sure that wasn't management?  He threw a turd. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, he's got a career here.  It's serious.  It was a very solid turd that hit me in the leg or the arm.  Oh, man.  I howled.  You have to laugh at that point.  Well, I guess as a parent, as a civilian, kind of just reflecting on that.  If someone else's kid threw a turd at me, I'd be horrified, of course.  Oh, my goodness.  What other commercials?  Elton John, me and Jimmy tweeted at the exact same time that Elton John should have been  playing the queen in that commercial, not the stupid king.  But some people were like, but he was playing the queen as a king. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  No, I was.  Get it.  What's this for?  Pepsi?  You didn't see the tape?  Take off all your clothes.  Enough!  No Pepsi for you.  Oh, boy.  Everything had to be an over-the-top production this year with the commercials, huh?  This broadcast thing, though.  Who is she? 
[00:55:30]  They had the auto-tune even this?  Yeah.  It's too bad, because she has a great voice.  Man.  You don't need that shit.  Makes me want to have gay sex.  Sometimes you don't need that shit.  Oh.  I didn't see his boobs.  All right.  Pepsi for you.  No.  Pepsi for all.  Oh, man.  She killed the queen.  I mean, the king.  Yeah.  That has a message.  Oh, that was some gay bashing right there. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, boy.  Oh, boy.  Flavor Flav.  That's terrific.  The Flav.  Her name is Julie Shepard.  Julie Shepard.  She's a terrific singer, Jimmy.  Yeah.  She's no Michael Carter.  So, could you imagine if she was, like, German or something?  Yeah.  Julie German?  That's not funny.  There he goes.  He rubbed his forearm all over Sam.  Well, we'll vote at the top commercials, so we can move on from this shit.  I hate the Super Bowl commercials. 
[00:56:30]  They're never good.  I don't hate them, but I don't think they're as great as everyone tries to make them out  to be.  I thought the Matthew Broderick one, the more I see it, I fucking don't like that one  at all.  Oh, it's just hard to watch.  I like the Seinfeld one, it was pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah, the original version, I saw the whole version of that, they cut the funniest line  when he goes, you want a dirty limerick?  And the old lady's standing there with yams.  Right.  And he's like, nobody wants a yam, honey, I'm working.  He said something.  Yeah.  Really, that was funny. 
[00:57:00]  So, what's the buzz?  What were the top commercials there, Sam?  Volkswagen, the dog strikes back.  Yeah, they're saying the buzziest ads were.  The buzziest?  Buzziest.  Who's going with the buzziest ads?  Yahoo.  Yahoo.  Sports.  The Volkswagen, Dog Strikes Back, Clint Eastwood, and E-Rock's favorite, the MetLife  cartoon medley.  Ah, well, E-Rock is a fan of the cartoon.  Those were the top three?  Yeah, E-Rock got a big erection when this cartoon ad came out.  What about the Fiat commercial, where they're basically telling you you need to jizz in between 
[00:57:30]  that girl's tits, and then you get a Fiat.  Or you get her, if you buy the Fiat, I was confused.  I don't know, yeah.  I guess if you buy the Fiat, you get the fucking splooge on her chest.  Yeah, you get to come in the girl's tits or something.  Yeah, I mean, that's the only way to look at that one, right?  A little, and then someone goes, if your sperm looks like that, that's pretty sad.  Fucking idiot.  Oh, man.  I like the fact that he's just, it's a car, but he's looking at her asshole.  He's gawking at her, bong.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Kind of dumb the commercial was in.  She's sexy, though.  Wow, yeah.  She's really sexy.  God, give her a smooch.  Excuse my French.  Smooch-y smooch.  She looks like a young Cefilio, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, we gotta talk for this, because no one knows Italian.  She probably has vomit breath.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking dumb model.  Nice, right?  Look at her, anorexic.  Look, she's, look.  Yeah, that's splooge.  She puts them on his lips, too.  She's a good girl.  He's a cuck. 
[00:58:30]  And then it's a dumb Fiat.  And an awful one.  It's just a dumb Fiat in the end.  Red interior.  Fucking bloody little car.  It's still a dumb Fiat.  Yeah.  That guinea bitch was hot, though.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, the Jeter commercial was awful.  I don't know if I saw the Jeter commercial.  Oh, where he pretends he's bopping to the music.  Oh, I didn't see that.  Oh, God.  I didn't focus on the commercials as much in past years.  No.  Can I say for the record, boy, can Meryl Streep fucking act. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, did you see the one where she was?  The Iron Lady.  Yes, the Iron Lady.  If she doesn't win Best Actress this year.  Playing Maggie Thatcher.  I guess she just won't.  You watched.  Yeah.  It was great.  It was good.  She was fucking fantastic.  She, like, from what I hear, just pulls off an unbelievable recreation of Margaret Thatcher.  She is, uh, yeah.  And she sounds British.  A lot of people say, we all like the Eminem with Sexy and I Know It song. 
[00:59:30]  Was that good?  No.  Was that good?  Eminem singing?  Who likes that?  Sexy and I Know It.  Wasn't the Eminem naked or something?  There was a bit of controversy there?  A little controversy?  Did it have a big cock?  Yeah.  Big Eminem dick?  I don't know.  Let's see this.  Oh, boy.  Let's see this.  Oh, boy.  I said, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm flattered that you love chocolate, but I'm here strictly  and a professional.  What's wrong with him?  He thinks you're naked. 
[01:00:00]  My shell is brown.  It just looks like my milk chocolate is showing.  Only a fool would think I'd actually show up naked.  So it's that kind of party.  That can't be mates.  Hit it.  I'm sexy and I know it.  Who thought this was a good commercial?  A lot of people.  Isn't this great?  No.  It's dancing Eminem.  That's cute.  But that Eminem's naked.  Yeah.  But he doesn't have a penis.  He's a pink sock.  Right.  His asshole prolapsed because he was trying to lift something. 
[01:00:30]  I didn't think of what it was.  I hear you.  Oh, God.  I guess that was it for the commercials in general.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  So that's your Super Bowl.  Congratulations to the Giants fans today.  Boston.  Fuck.  I know Tom Brady has a supermodel and all that.  But fuck.  That's two brutal losses in a Super Bowl.  That's rough.  Yeah.  That's fucking rough.  In the last couple of minutes.  Rough.  Good.  And two amazing catches, too. 
[01:01:00]  Yep.  I think this catch yesterday was probably more amazing than the Velcro catch.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  The other one was more than just a catch.  Yeah.  You sure it was more than just a catch?  I think so.  He got a spot on the sideline from that catch.  Yeah.  He was a street close.  Is he retired now or is he just not playing with them?  Well, I don't think he wanted to be retired, Jimmy.  Only so much you can do with that catch, you know, before they just got right already with  the catch.  You think that catch was more amazing than the one last night? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  On the top of the head.  Double coverage down the sideline and able to first get the ball there and then keep your  feet in bounds?  That was pretty fucking amazing, too, man.  He caught one-handed on his helmet on this one.  But he had Velcro on the fucking helmet.  Yeah, it's like slammed into the ground, didn't he?  Yeah, he did.  That ball should have fucking...  I know.  He should have shot out.  He should have dropped that ball.  Yeah.  I guess you're right.  It was a game-changer, though.  I'm looking for something that's not there.  The Dave Tyree catch could be the greatest catch ever.  Last night's was the game-changer right there, and that was it. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eli Manning, I mean, fuck.  What was the foul score four years ago?  I don't know anymore.  You know who the Mad Dog would just have that on the top of his head?  That was 38-31!  He would just absolutely know that.  17-14.  17-14.  Wow.  People are idiots.  Why?  Just write 97-12.  I was going to say that.  That's closer than that. 
[01:02:30]  I was going to say it was a blowout, so why are they focused on a dumb catch?  Just so I read it.  Yeah, I love it.  Ah, bravo.  So what's going on with this JFK thing?  I missed this one over the weekend.  Oh, yeah.  When did this come out?  We have to interview this woman.  Huh?  I have to read this book.  She's...  That's probably the only thing that's good in the book, though.  The excerpts were really good.  Well, yeah.  Very sexy.  Very dirty.  A lot of these people that have one moment in time, and then they have like 200 pages of filler in their book.  No, she had a lot more than one moment. 
[01:03:00]  She took a lot of fucking presidential loads.  Oh, this wasn't a one-time thing?  No.  Fuck, dude.  I'm so out of this.  Let me get in.  What's going on?  Yeah, she was an intern at the White House.  18-month affair with Jack Kennedy.  Yeah.  She was an intern at the White House?  Yeah.  So Clinton wasn't the first, huh?  Mm-mm.  He made fucking...  Holy shit.  JFK did it right.  Four days into her internship, she was invited by an aide to go to the mid...  for a midday swim in the White House pool. 
[01:03:30]  That sounds nice.  Yeah, midday swim.  Four days into it, you're all green and ready to go.  Yep.  Where the handsome 45-year-old president swam daily to ease chronic back pain.  JFK slid into the pool and floated up to her.  It's Mimi, isn't it?  He asked.  Yes, sir, she said.  And you're in the press office this summer, right?  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Yes, sir, I am, she said. 
[01:04:00]  That's what her voice probably sounds like.  Oh, gosh.  Lightning had struck.  Later that day, Mimi was invited by Dave Powers, the president's first friend,  and later the longtime curator of the Kennedy Library in Boston, to an after-work party.  When she arrived at the White House residence, Powers and two other young female staffers were waiting.  Powers poured and frequently refilled her gloss with daiquiris until the commander-in-chief arrived.  Get her liquored up.  Get her liquored up.  Yeah, nice.  Just so people know, they describe her as a slender, golden-haired 19-year-old. 
[01:04:30]  Yes, she's hot.  They got pictures of her up, and you can tell, even though it's like the early 60s, she's very hot.  And because of her finishing school, she was all polished and blue-blood.  Blue-blood.  She had blue-blood connections, so.  So JFK rolls up.  The president invited her for a personal tour.  She got up expecting the rest of the group to follow.  They know better.  They didn't.  He took her to Mrs. Kennedy's room. 
[01:05:00]  Holy shit.  Which, by the way, this is a president who has shit down.  Oh, yeah.  I noticed he was moving closer and closer.  I could feel his breath on my neck.  He put his hand on my shoulder.  The next thing she knew, he was standing above her, looking directly into her eyes and guiding her to the edge of the bed.  By the way, four days into her internship.  Four days.  The day he met her.  And we're not allowed to have interns while we finally are.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Well, he didn't kick her in the cunt.  Slowly, he unbuttoned the top of my shirt dress and touched my breasts. 
[01:05:30]  Yes.  Then he reached up between my legs and started to pull off my underwear.  I finished unbuttoning my shirt dress and let it fall off my shoulders.  Oh, man.  Kennedy pulled his pants down with his shirt still on.  Hovered above her on the bed.  Hovered.  He smelled of his cologne, 47-11.  Oh.  He paused when he noticed she was resisting.  Holy fuck.  Oh.  She resisted a little bit, huh? 
[01:06:00]  Well, you know, little pregame jitters.  Yeah.  Haven't you done this before?  He asked.  No, she said.  Are you okay?  He asked.  Yes, she said.  So he kept going, this time a little more gently.  Ah, what a guy.  After he finished, he hitched up his pants and smiled at me and pointed at the bathroom.  Takes her cherry, then he hitches his pants up and points to the toilet.  Points to the fucking bathroom.  Yeah, she was a virgin.  She said when she was done, she was in shock. 
[01:06:30]  He, on the other hand, was matter-of-fact and acted as if he had just occurred, was the  most natural thing in the world.  Was to him.  Would you like something to eat, he asked.  The kitchen's right there.  No, thank you.  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  He called a car to pick her up and take her home.  On the ride home, it kept echoing in my head, I'm not a virgin anymore.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, how about you're not a virgin anymore and Jack Kennedy took your fucking virginity. 
[01:07:00]  The next week, she was again invited to go swimming.  He barely acknowledged my arrival, betraying no hint of what had happened between us just  a few days before.  I couldn't bring myself to look him in the eye, she writes.  Later, he led her into a different bedroom.  This was the beginning of our affair.  Ah-ha.  Their sex was varied and fun.  He could be seductive and playful at times and sometimes acted like he had all the time  in the world.  Other times, he was in no mood to linger. 
[01:07:30]  Ah, he just needed to cum.  They spent an inordinate amount of time taking baths because, and he changed his shirt six  times a day because he hated feeling sweaty or grimy.  I think he probably had a B.O. problem.  Oh, wow.  Sweaty Boston drunk.  Just sweating out the fucking whiskey.  Well, what it was, he was probably fucking so many different girls.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't want the stink of some other chick's twat on him.  And you know that big, hairy, early 60s bush.  Yeah.  Oh, they didn't even touch it as far as any kind of manicuring goes.  How do you have time for politics? 
[01:08:00]  Hell of a fuck.  Well, he promised he would call later under the pseudonym Michael Carter.  Michael Carter.  And then he played a recording of Nat King Call's Autumn Leaves.  He made her concentrate on the lyrics.  Even JFK's...  Listen to the words.  This is the part that I think is pertinent to our situation.  When Nat says, I'm fucking you, keep your mouth shut, or I'll have you killed like Marilyn.  Listen to the lyrics.  Marilyn Monroe is so killed. 
[01:08:30]  So killed by the Kennedys.  It all makes sense now.  You're trying to make...  She wanted a yap.  As a parting gift, she gave him a copy of the record and trimmed the cover.  And Chlamydia.  Yes.  Yes.  And a paternity suit.  You didn't say the words from Autumn Leaves.  But I miss...  He made her concentrate on the lyrics, but I miss you most of all, my darling, when autumn leaves start to fall.  You're not singing it like Nat King Cole.  But I miss you most of all, me darling, when autumn leaves start to fall. 
[01:09:00]  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  In person.  As a parting gift, she gave him a copy of the record and trimmed the cover with leaves she had collected.  Apparently, she was a retard girl.  Yeah, really.  He's collecting leaves on the White House lawn.  What else?  She gave him a macaroni glued to a paper plate.  He made her fucking stalker patty.  He made her a decoupage.  Yeah, a decoupage.  No, she made him.  Yeah.  Oh, she made him.  This is beautiful.  Throw this in the trotch.  You're trying to make me cry. 
[01:09:30]  He told her, I'm not trying to make you cry, Mr. President.  She said, I'm trying to make you remember me.  Within a week of her return to collage, she got a call from, wink, Michael Carter.  Michael Carter here.  He asked dozens of questions.  What courses were you taking?  Do you like your teachers?  Are you fucking any Negroes?  Were the girls interesting?  Do you have any friends who will eat my ass?  What did she have for dinner? 
[01:10:00]  He then invited her to Washington when Jackie was away.  Yes, my wife's in Greece meeting a shipping guru, magnate, who shall be fucking after my  brains are scattered all over Dealey Plaza.  My wife's making plans for the future.  A car service would pick her up and drive her to the airport, where a paid ticket to  D.C. would be waiting for her. 
[01:10:30]  Nice.  Yes.  I have a lot of miles on Continental.  Upon arrival, a chauffeur holding a sign up for Michael Carter would take her to the  White House.  On one visit, he was in the middle of the most defining moment of his presidency, the Cuban  Missile Crisis.  Although historians have dissected Kennedy's actions, none were privy to what he confided  to Mimi.  Oh, shit.  He said, I'd rather my children red than dead, he told her.  Oh, wow. 
[01:11:00]  It was a chilling insight.  When the president wasn't keeping the world from descending into war, there was plenty of  wild partying.  One instance was a raucous Hollywood bash at Bing Crosby's ranch.  Oh, boo-boo-boo-boo.  They just knocked around women together.  Yeah.  Ah, you mind if I punch you in the face?  Yes.  Hey, Bing, could you bring your children in here?  I'd like to knock them around a little.  I lost the money on the Sox game.  My fat friend won't even watch the Patriots play.  He broke his knee, man. 
[01:11:30]  I was sitting next to him in the living room, won a handful of yellow capsules.  Most likely, amyl nitrate, commonly known as poppers, was offered up by one of the guests.  The president asked me if I wanted to try the drug, which stimulated the heart, but also  purportedly enhanced sex.  I said no, but he just went ahead and popped the capsule and held it under my nose.  Oh.  He didn't try it himself.  Kennedy had her doing poppers. 
[01:12:00]  Poppers.  It wasn't her first glimpse of Kennedy's dark side.  Oh.  He had been guilty of an even more callous and unforgivable episode at the White House during  a noon swim.  So amazing.  Dave Powers had rolled up his pants to cool his feet in the water.  Ooh.  The president swam over and whispered in my ear, Mr. Powers looks a little tense.  Would you take care of it?  Oh, my God.  This guy is great.  It was a dare.  This guy? 
[01:12:30]  You mean JFK?  JFK, man.  What a good friend.  Holy fuck.  You know, it was a dare.  My friend wants to charge me to have his wife look at my script.  Look what JFK was doing.  It was a dare.  It was a dare.  But I knew exactly what he meant.  That was a challenge to give Dave Powers oral sex.  Yeah.  I didn't think the president thought I'd do it.  But I'm ashamed to say that I did.  Yeah, you sucked that dick.  The president silently watched.  Wow, what the fuck?  Alfred, then Mimi Beardsley. 
[01:13:00]  Mimi Beardsley sucked his dick.  Beardsley.  Said that later the president apologized to them both.  Ah.  Ah, Mimi Beardsley.  She could suck the chrome off a trail edge, Dave.  She'll pull shit right through your balls and out of your cock.  That Beardsley girl really sucks a good dick.  Her name is horrible.  And it's a real cock softener.  Wait till Mimi Beardsley gets your dick in her mouth.  She sucks a good dick. 
[01:13:30]  They call her Mimi Beardsley because she sucks your pubes right onto her lower chin.  Looks like she has a beard.  Mimi Beardsley.  Don't say the name because your cock will wilt like hot tea was thrown in your face.  Jessica Cantor is a sexier name.  I'd rather have Marina Oswald is a better name than Mimi Beardsley. 
[01:14:00]  I don't like any woman with a name like Facial Hair.  Yes.  Sounds like a Harry Potter character.  You remember Bessie Hairlip?  She sucks dick even better than Bessie Hairlip.  Oh, Diana Prolapse was a good blowjob giver.  But Mimi Beardsley really knows how to pull the cum out of your balls, Dave. 
[01:14:30]  Trust old Mike Carter here.  Holy fuck.  She'll have your cum splattered all over.  For years they'll be analyzing the tape.  Oh, look, his cock went back into the left.  They'll think other people helped her suck it.  She'll do it so good.  How foretelling is this?  Okay.  One of their last times together was at a Boston Democratic fundraiser.  Ted Kennedy, the president's baby brother, 
[01:15:00]  and future leaky-headed man was in a room with them.  I could see that mischievous look in his eye.  The bodacious Mimi Beardsley.  50-50 where it counts.  This buxotic.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's blow his brains out.  Oh, I could see that mischievous look coming to his eye. 
[01:15:30]  Mimi, why don't you take care of my baby brother?  And by that I mean give him a head x-ray.  He could stand a little relaxation.  Holy fuck.  You've got to be kidding me.  Absolutely not, Mr. President.  About to be married to her college sweetheart.  Oh, man.  Tony Fashionstock.  Tony Fonstock.  That's his name?  Yeah.  She met Kennedy for the last time at the Carlisle Hotel in Manhattan. 
[01:16:00]  Ah.  Seven days before his assassination in Dallas.  Yeah.  Wow.  What do you think happened in that hotel room?  Seven days.  You think she went back one more time?  Oh, of course she did.  He met him in the Carlisle?  Of a taste.  Yeah.  Of a taste.  Yeah, he fucked.  I want you to go home and kiss Mr. Fonsdale with the stink of my presidential cum on your breath.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  I'm just saying your name so I don't cum too fast.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Eat my arse, Mimi Beardsley. 
[01:16:30]  Get little arse hairs on your face.  Oh, Mimi mustache.  What a terrible, terrible name.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, is that awful?  It really is fucking bad.  How the fuck did she keep this a secret?  Dude, she was pretty, man.  Yeah.  She was cute.  She's got like, all of her features are very nice.  What a great profile.  Very smooth.  Yeah, she's got an amazing profile. 
[01:17:00]  What did the body look like?  Did she have some big and heavies or anything?  I don't know.  Are there any pictures of her?  That's it.  That's the only picture that exists of her from back then?  I guarantee you there's some in her book.  Oh.  One of her just sucking fucking Kennedy's dick.  Hopefully, yeah.  I wonder how big his dick was.  I hope she says.  He probably had a massive hog.  No, he was Irish.  He probably had like five and a half, six.  You think?  Yeah.  Pretend it's a lot bigger.  Make a lot of noise when I stick it in.  I have to shower again.  I have armpit odor. 
[01:17:30]  And I'm all hot because I wear a back brace and it makes me grimy.  Yeah, he did wear that brace.  Yes, he did.  That's why he couldn't slump down when he got shot.  When he was shot, when you see Kennedy, he grabs his throat and there's a very weird motion he makes in the limo.  It almost looks like he's leaning on a fence.  Oh, man.  He had a back brace and he couldn't just collapse in.  Oh, he could have fucking laid down in the seat or something.  Maybe he wouldn't have gotten that headshot.  Some people say that shot wouldn't have come.  Yeah, some people say that fucked him up.  Oh, man.  Obviously a different time. 
[01:18:00]  I was shooting Mimi in the head.  All the shit was going on and no one was talking.  Yep.  Nobody.  Oswald did to me exactly what I did to Mimi, except I did more damage.  I blew her wig right off.  Oh, Mimi Beardsdale.  Miss Beardsley.  I love to fuck a face that's named after a man's facial hair.  It's like reminds me of Dan Haggerty.  My wife's got a big Greek shipping magnate cock buried in her throat right now. 
[01:18:30]  I bet fucking Onassis loved ass play.  Of course he did.  And his cock was probably big-headed and fat.  Oh, God damn.  Yeah.  Like a diner cook.  I heard that Aristotle's cock was like nine by six, and it would really tip left, and  he would look at her and go, what's that remind you of?  Oh, shit. 
[01:19:00]  Do they explain why she kept the story secret for so many fucking years?  I think it's just because-  She's a good girl.  How do you live with that story?  It wasn't a TMZ.  It wasn't a TMZ country.  We didn't function that way.  Well, there has been for a while now, though.  You would assume this would have came out before now.  Maybe she didn't want the hubby to know she was fucking Kennedy when-  This is almost 50 years ago.  When they were dating.  When they were still dating and shit, and getting ready to be married.  Remember I told you that you were my first to her husband?  Oh, God, that's right.  She probably was a virgin.  Yeah.  And told the guy, yeah, well, I haven't done that.  I'm waiting for marriage.  And there's fucking Jack just pounding her fresh pussy. 
[01:19:30]  He would always wonder why her fucking- she had like a fucking lipstick was smeared,  and her breath smelled like, what was it, 4711, whatever Apple Cologne it was?  What kind of 40- what is that, like high karate?  Hasn't been around since.  Yeah, it's probably- it smells like money.  Yeah.  Kennedy might have got himself killed because he was fooling around with the wrong broad.  Oh, man.  What the fuck?  I bet his bed- I bet his bed looked like the fucking seat in the limo.  After fucking that cherry.  That's why they cleaned it up so quickly.  They were just so used to Kennedy making a mess back there. 
[01:20:00]  They took him to the hospital.  They didn't even know what was wrong.  Yeah, what's the matter?  There's blood in the seat?  Yeah, it happens all the time.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucks a lot of virgins back there.  Do we need to clean her hiney?  Yeah.  Usually they were wiping shit and intern tears off that seat.  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Get me a woman with a horrible name.  Blow my friend Dave in the pool.  His feet are being cooled off. 
[01:20:30]  He's just dipping his tootsies in the pool.  If you thought Anthony Cormier was a piece of shit as a host, I'll have you suck my friend's car.  At least he'll just get drunk and repeat himself.  I'm having a Super Bowl party.  We're going to karaoke.  Well, you're going to karaoke.  I'm going to have Mimi Beardsley eating Robert's asshole upstairs.  Hey, I'd like you to jerk my brother off in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel. 
[01:21:00]  Would you do that for me?  Just jerk him off into it.  You're going to love Mimi, Bobby.  You're going to love her.  Oh, my God.  She better have been hot with that name.  Yeah, it's just terrible.  That name ain't getting her through any doors.  Just don't repeat any of the jokes I've been telling you, Mimi.  He's partial to the Negroes.  Well, fuck, I think we just took on book radio. 
[01:21:30]  I'll bet you that they fucked girls together, Bobby and Jackie.  Yeah, you think they tag-teamed girls?  Wow.  That would be a biggie, huh?  Me and Florentine, I pulled trains with Voss.  You'd hope that Jack and Bobby Kennedy pulled trains together.  Now you know why Marilyn Monroe died.  She couldn't keep her fucking mouth shut like the rest of them.  You think she was jibber-jabbering about fucking the Kennedys?  She was probably the one that said, I'm coming forward with this shit.  And she's one that supposedly had sex with both of them. 
[01:22:00]  Maybe not at the same time.  She was fucking Bobby and fucking JFK.  It's absolutely true.  Oh, God.  DiMaggio's just all pissed off about it.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I bet you he'd punch her.  That's why he abused her.  He'd fucking knock her teeth out every time they fucking showed a clip of Kennedy.  13 days of the missile crisis.  Every time he was up there, they breathe the same air.  Marilyn got a shiner.  She's cringing that the State of the Union's coming on.  She just knows it's a sound thrashing with a Louisville slugger. 
[01:22:30]  Camelot was bullshit.  Yeah.  Oh, old Jolton Joe DiMaggio just pounding her in the face.  Anything that reminded him of the fact that she one time kissed him after coming from JFK's library.  Yeah.  He just aimed for that mole on her face.  That's why he drank coffee.  Because he wanted the cum out of his...  He had the taste of Jack's cum.  And he wanted to have coffee breath.  Because that...  Long way to go.  Well, it's good, though. 
[01:23:00]  Ah, shit.  They all knew how to keep secrets back then.  Yeah.  Well, if they didn't, they ended up in the hotel.  Well, the press was better then, too.  A supposed drug overdose, huh?  Because none of that stuff really is news.  Who gives a fuck if an intern sucks his dick?  Well, one guy from the press, you would think, would have said something.  It's amazing that you all kept quiet like they did.  You just didn't do it back then, man.  We can't even comprehend that with the world we live in now.  Wow.  Very good, Jimmy.  That's a hell of a story.  I want to read the book.  We've got to interview her, man.  I mean, that's...  That'd be cool. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, can we get her?  We'd love to talk to her.  Jack's cock size.  You think she'd talk about that?  No, she wouldn't.  She's an older lady, but I'd...  She's blue blood, eh?  I'd squeeze in the question, somehow.  Somehow, yeah.  Just word it in a way where maybe she, you know, hey, did it hurt?  Yeah.  How long after, like, let me...  I don't know how to say this respectfully.  How long after his head came off, did your vagina finally get wet again?  Like, every time you were touched after that, like, whenever your husband would rub your clit,  would you just think of that shot ringing out behind the Stemmons freeway sign? 
[01:24:00]  Do you imagine she's fucking a guy for 18 months, the best-looking, most powerful guy  on the planet, and then just to see a murdered lady...  Oh, they didn't see it for five years.  The American public didn't see the Secruder tape until probably 68.  But she was 19.  She wasn't telling all her friends?  Yeah.  You kind of think she was yakking.  I guarantee you there's one or two she told.  And no one believed her, probably.  Hey, Ray.  Well, they just knew better than the...  They kept their mouth shut.  And once he got shot, he just...  Who's that? 
[01:24:30]  Marilyn Monroe and who?  And Reagan.  That's Reagan.  Oh, does Reagan fuck you, too?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, she just...  Marilyn, pull down those panties.  Why else would she be there, if you think about it?  The fucking starts in five minutes.  Years.  And I pulled out my balls, and they brushed the face of Marilyn.  See, everything he did later, he just said earlier to Marilyn, wish I could do Reagan.  Years.  That was a perfect Reagan.  People are like, you're not going to address Jimmy's awful Boston accent? 
[01:25:00]  Are you kidding me?  It's a great Boston accent.  It sounds just like him.  What's wrong with you?  Close your eyes.  You'd think it was him.  Fucking perfect.  Yeah.  Shaw.  Shaw.  What was wrong with that accent?  That's got to be the best of what's in the book, though.  I can't imagine there's anything else in the book.  I could read just a lot of them.  Any details about that I want to read, though.  I would like to hear about the Beardsley childhood, what it was like growing up in the Beardsley  house.  Yeah, what was it like?  You think it starts with all that bullshit?  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  I was young, born to the Beardsley family. 
[01:25:30]  Her path to the White House?  Yes.  How she got there.  Snoresville.  Her dumb fucking boyfriend, Tony, that cuck.  Yeah.  Presidential cuck.  Yeah.  You know she used that in an argument.  Oh, yeah.  We were talking about it behind the scenes, but...  Well, I fucked the president.  Right.  They probably had some kind of heated argument, and she fucking broke that doozy out.  Yeah.  Broke that one out.  God damn.  Jack Kennedy.  The more I hear about him, the more I just love him.  Oh, what a great...  Better red than dead. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  He was ready to give up.  If he's getting that done without showing any nerves, you gotta think he was knocking  him back left and right.  And he's president during a pretty tumultuous time in history, and he's there just knocking  him down.  Setting him up and knocking him down.  Which proves the time wasn't that tumultuous, is what I'm thinking.  Ah, the commies.  Who gives a shit?  Bring me a virgin.  He had all that shit under control in the end.  Yeah.  No, I bet you knew exactly what the fuck he was doing.  It was probably tumultuous because of what he was doing. 
[01:26:30]  They're like, Mr. President, we've been telling you for two weeks about these fucking  Russian ships in the ocean.  Well, how close are they to Cuba?  Oh, no, I forgot about that.  Mimi Beardsley had two fingers in my asshole.  She said there was fecal matter in her fingernails.  Oh, you did mention that.  I forgot about it.  It's Irish now.  It's Irish.  I love it.  Wait, how close are the boats to Cuba?  Oh, fuck.  My dick smells like Mimi Beardsley.  If you launch an attack at us, I will aim directly at Russia. 
[01:27:00]  All right, thank you.  Good night.  Is Mimi in the car?  I'd like my asshole licked.  You think he'd just let it get closer and closer?  He forgot about it.  He didn't know.  He was like, ah, I think I got a little more time here.  Yeah.  Get it in one more time.  Yeah.  That's why he didn't fucking put, that's why there was no fucking bubble top in Dallas.  I want to text Mimi and I can't text her with the bubble tops.  I get no service in Dallas.  I want to send a mimeograph to Mimi while I'm driving. 
[01:27:30]  A mimeograph.  Yeah, a mimeograph to Mimi Beardsley.  Are you sure he didn't say better dead than red?  A lot of people are saying that.  Yes.  No, you're saying better red than red.  That's why there was a chilling insight.  Yeah.  Because it was, all right.  Because publicly he was saying.  It shows he was just bluffing.  Like.  I'd rather see them red than dead.  Yeah.  If he, if the Rooshkis knew that he wasn't going to really do this whole, you know, mutual destruction thing.  Mimi.  Yeah.  I love it.  Our children breathe the same air as our children, which smells a lot of times like my cologne mixed with semen and virgin blood on the sheets. 
[01:28:00]  A little speck of copper with cum all over it.  That's what it smells like.  Russian children will breathe that in.  Ich bin ein stinky dick.  I believe in this, Dakar.  We will go to the moon and I will be blown by Mimi Beardsley.  And do those other things. 
[01:28:30]  We'll either go to the moon or I'll put my penis in some nice ass cheeks while a girl is mooning in the pool.  Could you finger Dave Powers, asshole, please?  He said the socks lost.  He's a little tense.  He's a little tense.  I would offer a massage, but I know I could get you to suck his penis.  Weren't you a virgin Tuesday?  Now I'm pimping you out.  Jesus Christ.  He goes from virginity and purity to sucking the president's pal. 
[01:29:00]  I know you've only had sex for two days, but would you mind jerking off, Mr. Krusechev?  We're really talking about a lot here.  Holy fucking A.  Yeah, could you gangbang my cabinet?  I know you were a virgin, but I'd like you to use your lips on Medgar Evers.  He's acting like a real troublemaker.  Could you get that Dr. King to stop marching all over the place? 
[01:29:30]  He's tying up traffic.  Holy shit.  Suck my brother Teddy's cock.  Pull his pants off.  They still might be a little damp.  He had a little incident, you know.  He's tense.  Teddy wants to come in your mouth, but don't let him drive you home.  I'll send the car for you.  And don't mention my retarded sister while you're sucking his cock.  That's a real sensitive point. 
[01:30:00]  Don't mention the tart in the basement.  You can fuck me.  You can relieve Teddy's stress, but don't mention Dumbella downstairs.  It's a real mood killer.  Mimi Beardsley.  Don't mention the family secret that somebody was drunk with a baby in the womb and popped out an idiot.  She's in her home far, far away. 
[01:30:30]  Here, have a drink that my father brought in illegally.  Have some bootlegged alcohol.  You're a virgin, aren't you?  Smell these poppers.  Homosexuals will be doing it through holes in the wall.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Here you go.  This is what George Michael does.  I don't know who he is either.  Baby Beardsley.  Oh, fuck, man.  God damn, Jimmy. 
[01:31:00]  We got to book her.  I would love to talk to her.  I really would.  I have some fucking living.  All right.  We got a break.  We got a lot of...  That's hilarious.  Don't play this break for her.  We got a lot of live reads to get to.  Bravo, Jimmy.  Bravo.  Oh, fuck.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. Live.  Here's the latest batch of F years.  Fuck you.  I'd like to say fuck you to the people who smell on the train.  Who smells it?  Eight o'clock in the morning. 
[01:31:30]  Fuck you.  Take a bath.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, Opie.  Quit picking teams.  Fuck you.  Every time you pick a team, you jinx them.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I want to make this F.U. to fucking traffic.  I've been sitting here for two hours hungry, and I want to take a fucking piss.  Fuck you to traffic.  Keep fucking moving.  Fuck you.  Hey, this is Floyd.  I want to say fuck you to my boss for talking to me in the bathroom while I'm taking a shit. 
[01:32:00]  Man, I'm trying to take a shit in the morning.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you all for that deal.  I'm usually into these women are like animals.  You need to swat them like the lioness gets swatted from the lion.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I just want to give a big hearty fuck you to my girlfriend after getting mad at me and  saying you need to save six months and you finally tell me you have a fucking retarded  sister in a wheelchair.  You know what? 
[01:32:30]  Fuck you, Avery.  Fuck you.  I just want to give fuck you to my digestive system.  Find my way to work.  I just burped.  I threw up in my mouth.  Fuck you, digestive system.  Fuck you.  I want to give a big fuck you to my trucking company, my dispatchers.  They need fucking Ted and Reno for five fucking days and won't move me to get a fucking load.  Y'all can kiss my wild ass and suck my dick.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  This F.U. goes out to my co-worker who eats with his fucking mouth open. 
[01:33:00]  All I hear is, quit smacking your teeth.  I'm going to punch him out, bitch.  Fuck you.  For the Canadian asshole that says don't be an agony show, go fuck yourself, moron.  I'm over here now.  Fuck yeah.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents  Primetime Sam Roberts 
[01:33:30]  and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get.  Musical icon and living legend, Elton John.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Sir Elton John.  Sir Elton, how are you with electronics?  With electronics?  Yes.  Hopeless.  Thank you so much for your time.  Thank you.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and One Question with a Guest We Couldn't Get on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:34:00]  Sirius XM.  Hey, this is Brooklyn Deckert.  Hey, this is Tufa Grace.  Hey, this is Mullen Ackermit.  Hey, this is Fisher Stevens.  Hey, this is Jack Osborne.  And you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will be in studio tomorrow.  I'm really excited about this.  Cannot wait.  Holy fuck.  One of the greatest NBA players of all time. 
[01:34:30]  Highest scorer ever.  He's just amazing.  And Kevin Smith in studio tomorrow.  That's cool.  Very good.  And then on Wednesday, looking forward to this one.  Daryl Hammond coming in.  Can't wait to see Daryl.  Very intimidating guy over the years.  I've run into him a whole bunch of times, and he was never approachable.  So I never walked up to him and just said hi.  His book is really, really good.  It starts off with him talking about how he's thinking about or started to cut his arm off. 
[01:35:00]  That's how the book starts.  And I'm 30 pages from the end, and I'm up to the year 2010, where you find Daryl Hammond in a crack house smoking crack.  And that's not that long ago.  And in between, he's got all these issues.  Yeah.  No, it's not that long ago.  It's really a good book.  Crazy, man.  As early as 2010, he was smoking crack in a crack house.  Daryl Hammond, who hung out with presidents, at least two, maybe three.  Fuck.  That's crazy. 
[01:35:30]  He's going to be on, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  His mom fucked him up.  Fucked him up.  Done fucked him up.  Fucked him up.  But he doesn't really get into it.  It's just flashbacks.  No.  Quick flashbacks.  He remembers a quick little thing that might have happened or did happen, I guess.  Yeah.  But doesn't really go into it too much.  Quick flashbacks.  So.  Very interesting.  Very honest.  Can't wait to have him on.  Yeah.  So that'll be Wednesday.  Daryl Hammond.  Cool.  Yeah.  It was a quick read, man. 
[01:36:00]  Two days.  Very easy read.  Very easy read.  What else is going on?  It's all about the Super Bowl, I guess.  But what else can you talk about?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's been covered.  Yeah.  Enough of right time to move on.  Yeah.  Now we're, you know, we gave it enough time.  Do you think?  Yeah.  NBC apologizes for MIA flipping middle finger at Super Bowl halftime show.  Who gives a shit?  You really have to apologize?  Who cares?  Who even saw it?  Huh?  Who even saw it?  I don't think anyone saw it. 
[01:36:30]  As it ran.  I guess you had to have a special feed, right?  Because they got the delay, so they just kind of blurted it out, I heard.  Oh.  Right?  So who fucking is so upset?  I don't know.  If you got what?  The children.  What if the children see?  Please.  Demi Moore's in rehab.  Utah.  Yeah.  Huh?  After doing her whippets and whatever else she was doing.  Jesus.  Allegedly, Salvia.  Possibly, right?  Oh, was she?  Yeah.  We got an annoying guy that has nothing to say. 
[01:37:00]  It's been just on hold for a minute.  Iraq.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, dude.  You're on the air, man.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  You.  You, right there.  Everyone say hi.  Hello?  Yes.  Yes, you!  Yeah, you.  Dave from Cincinnati.  All right.  Whatever.  I didn't know your name, so I said hello.  Why don't you say hello back?  Because I didn't know you were talking to me.  I thought I was just...  And coincidentally, I just came over from the DMM. 
[01:37:30]  You know what?  I call Sam's show a lot now.  Yeah.  Because I'm on my way home.  Uh-huh.  It is so obvious when the host is talking to you.  So obvious.  You hear like a...  Yeah, yeah.  It goes like this.  You hear the radio show, and it's like...  It's a little lower, so it's like...  Yeah, and...  Oh, let's go to the phones.  Who's over here?  Hi, you're on the air.  Hi.  What, are you going to sit there?  I used to...  I used to...  I used to...  I used to assume that maybe it wasn't that obvious, but since, you know, calling the 
[01:38:00]  Sam show, whatever the fuck it's called after us, it's so obvious.  Dave.  No, it's not obvious.  No, it is.  No, it is obvious.  We have been callers.  It's 8 in the morning.  I'm stoned.  All right, fair enough.  I'm stoned.  Fair enough.  Howard Stern's horrible customer service.  Assholes kept me on for two hours, killed two buzzes, and I said,  you know what?  Fuck Howard.  What? 
[01:38:30]  It's like high school, okay?  And Howard is the quarterback of the high school team, but he's graduating, and there's  this other cool table, the O&A table, and I know that once Howard leaves, I'm going to  have to suck up to these guys.  You do realize we're probably leaving before Howard's home.  Your analogy sucks.  Yeah.  And I don't mind talking to that.  We're dropping out of high school.  Yeah, I don't mind talking to the Howard people, and I hope they come aboard, but fuck,  we have to go with the burnouts?  Why were you on hold with him for two hours, and he gave up, and now you're calling us?  Because I felt like I had, as a duty, like, to fuck the Super Bowl. 
[01:39:00]  Our Super Bowl is the radio Super Bowl.  Our, as radio guys, guys going to the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  All right, be honest, guys.  You looked up to Howard, and he is going to the big time, and I'm fearful that he's going  to fuck up and ruin it for everyone.  What do you mean?  The big time is the TV show.  When is he going to the big time?  Isn't he in the big time, I guess?  I would think.  America's Got Talent.  Half a billion bucks is the big time, if you ask me.  Well.  So Howard is going to go into this show thinking... 
[01:39:30]  I thought the commercial was kind of douchey, to be honest with you, but the move itself  is good for him.  You know what, with the firehose?  No.  Oh, that was right.  No.  I thought it's what it was, you know.  It was appropriate.  It was fake edgy.  But the fact is, him going to America's Got Talent is a great move, because he's feeling  what we feel around here.  You don't have any exposure being on SiriusXM.  You're kind of like just under the radar.  Right.  So of course he took that gig to get back on the radar.  He tried everything on satellite, and you're sort of... 
[01:40:00]  Sometimes you're on the radar, and a lot of times you're just not.  You're just kind of sitting there.  Yeah.  But here's the thing...  Hold on one second, buddy.  I'll say yes, you are.  It depends.  When I was in Phoenix, I was like, wow, man, a lot of people listen to Satellite, because  they're all fans, and we were never on there.  But what would put...  The people we got are extremely loyal, but we don't have the masses like we used to.  What would help with that is another element to the show, a video element, a TV element.  Right.  Hello! 
[01:40:30]  It costs money to listen to you guys.  Yeah, I know.  Most of your listeners are homeless.  Without credit cards.  Homeless.  You're not homeless.  I was homeless, and I couldn't get Satellite Radio.  It was the worst thing about it.  All right.  Well, then I guess our listeners are homeless.  But you're not one of our listeners.  You're one of our listeners today.  Yeah.  Remember?  Hello.  Hello.  Opie, you...  I talked to you on Friday under a fake name, because it was my first time calling.  Aw.  And you told me to call back, because I remember I said, you should watch that movie, Drive. 
[01:41:00]  That was me.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And you said...  And Jimmy was going, I hate analogy guys.  I hate analogy guys.  Oh, you were analogy guys?  Yeah.  And you were like...  Oh, that's why.  I said, yeah.  No, I thought he was great.  I said, call back a lot.  I remember now.  He had his horrid analogies.  You were terrible, sir.  What was your best analogy for Friday?  Because I really enjoyed him.  Gladiator.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  You weren't talking.  You were just speaking in analogies, sir.  That's all I got. 
[01:41:30]  Jimmy, yesterday was my birthday.  I'm a Super Bowl baby.  I'm 46 years old on February 5th, so I am the ultimate fucked in the ass by corporate  America narcissist douchebag.  Oh, listen to him, man.  So I'm your demographic, and I'm telling you, I've had it with Howard, and I'm going through  a trial separation.  Why don't you listen to both, sir, if you want?  You can listen to both.  We both replay all day.  Exactly.  And both shows don't really give a shit anymore anyway.  Yeah.  Oh, it's like we're just clocking our time. 
[01:42:00]  If this was 2000, that would be great.  What?  And tell me if I interrupt too much, because I have that problem.  Well, you are.  I've just emerged from a three-month cocoon horrific depression where I talk to people  Another word for cocoon is?  What?  Stop stuttering.  In person.  You mean being a pussy?  No, sir.  Yeah, I was a pussy.  I was depressed.  I wasn't a real man.  Like, I didn't have Godfather Corley Ongoing going, you're going to act like a man. 
[01:42:30]  Like, if I had had someone say that once to me, I would have been good.  People are starting to ask, what did we do?  What did we do wrong?  They want to know.  What happened?  The listeners want to know what they did wrong to deserve this.  Sir, can you please do that impression again?  I thought it was dead on.  Please.  Which one?  The act like a man one.  It was amazing.  Did you?  I have to say, I'm very susceptible to flattery.  He's susceptible to flattery.  Everybody is, sir.  That's great. 
[01:43:00]  How do you not love this guy?  Could you do the, seriously, do the impression again.  It was pretty amazing.  It was good.  I'll say that.  I've got a bunch of other ones.  Oh, good.  Do that one first.  Yeah, do the act like a man just to set it up again.  And let's run through your impressions.  Well, don't be a control freak.  Even though, if I was at the bar with you, within like 20 minutes, I'd be like saying,  oh, he's the greatest.  And, you know, I'm just trying to get your, like, fallout.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But right now, I feel like I've got Don Corleone.  He just told me that. 
[01:43:30]  So, I'd rather just do other surprise impressions.  And as soon as one sucks, just hang up on me.  Okay.  Surprise impressions.  All right.  But we do have a time.  Freddy Corleone.  We have a timing issue here, though.  We can't spend an hour with you.  So, you've got to kind of, like, you know, move it along a little bit.  Yeah.  Do the impression.  With all doers.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  That's the famous actual one.  Was that me?  Yes, it was.  Did you find my voice back?  Yes, we did.  To prove how good it was.  Very good.  No, no, no.  You were doing fine. 
[01:44:00]  You were courteous and receptive to courtesy.  You established trust with the embarrassing truth about Migs.  And now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire.  It won't do.  Good finish there.  Who made that finish?  Jim Norton.  That was Jimmy Norton.  Hey, so I'll just take the assist.  Like, here's my problem as a narcissist, Super Bowl baby, is my whole life I've been the  cock block.  I've been the Roger Federer of cock blockers.  Yeah.  And so I want to be the, for the first time, the guy that- 
[01:44:30]  I love calls like this.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I want to be the guy that guides Jimmy's cock.  You know?  I mean, that wasn't a movie.  I forget which one.  Super bad.  That was a great movie.  All right.  And here, I'll let you go.  I'll tell you my top five favorite movies of all time.  All right.  Let me write them down.  I want to remember this.  All right.  And it tells you everything you need to know about me because each movie thematically  resonates with the asshole that I am.  Sure.  All right.  Number one, of course, we mentioned Gladiator.  Gladiator.  Nice. 
[01:45:00]  Not Shawshank Redemption, which helps me not hate Republicans and understand them.  Nice.  Number three is American Beauty because, you know, we, of course, we know.  Pulp Fiction is number four.  Nice.  And did I say Silence of the Lambs?  No.  You just did.  Sorry.  And then, you know, depending on my mood and how good the weed is, my next five will rotate  around, you know.  Well, that's a solid five list.  How come the lambs are talking so much? 
[01:45:30]  Ah, Chip.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  I'm sorry, Chip.  Please get away from me with your forearm.  And here, I just coughed off Chip.  Yeah.  All right.  You all good, Dave?  Yeah, that's it.  When should I call back?  Because there's a special line.  I have a special line.  Yeah, you've got it right there.  Yeah, you've got the number.  You're getting through.  So, tomorrow.  All right.  Let's call tomorrow.  All right.  No, wait.  Here's my last thing.  I've got a reality show, game show idea that I was going to give to Howard this morning 
[01:46:00]  that I'm going to see if you can judge talent.  Because anyone can judge a singing monkey on stage.  Could you have been in 2003 and been Mark Zuckerberg's, like, older landlord and said,  hey, I think this guy could be a billionaire?  Now, that's judging talent.  Anyone can judge some dumbass on stage.  Fuck it.  That's all I got.  You speak the truth.  All right, Dave.  Thank you so much.  And we've got this guy who's been waiting two and a half hours.  George and New York, two and a half hours.  What do you got?  Where's Otto? 
[01:46:30]  They want to legalize pot.  Hi, guys.  I have an idea.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  I have an idea so you can go to the Super Bowl next year.  Some of these assholes are going to be back tomorrow after starting at the Super Bowl.  One of them is going to say, hey, guys, we'll let you go next year.  And you just turn around and let Club Sonny Kenny say, we've already booked the tickets  for the plane ride and the hotel in New Orleans.  You waited two hours for that.  Two hours, 15 minutes.  Well, I fell asleep halfway through it.  Oh, you fell asleep with the phone next to your ear? 
[01:47:00]  So did we.  Yeah.  Yes, we did.  Did you like the Super Bowl?  Yes.  No, but at least Eastside Dave went there and you guys didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm blowing.  Punching out.  I'm blowing.  I'm blowing, he says.  He was on hold for two hours and 15 minutes.  I know.  Isn't that amazing?  All right.  It really is.  God.  Shut up. 
[01:47:30]  People have Super Bowl fatigue.  You think?  I kind of get that, yeah.  And I noticed not as many cars on the road.  Do you think people take the day off?  Yes.  A lot of people take the Monday off.  I would have loved to.  Of course.  If anybody would take today off.  But we're broadcasters.  Yes.  We have to be here to talk about the Super Bowl.  We're professionals.  The big game.  Rise above.  I've been shitting out cheese all morning.  Oh, God.  I went all in with the cheese again.  What did you have at your Super Bowl party?  Not really a party.  Just a few people.  But a little get together.  E-Rock brought over a whole fucking tray of shit. 
[01:48:00]  Of course.  Oh, I mean.  He brought it over in garbage, in a garbage bag.  So it makes it easier for me to throw it out.  You're just going to put it in the can.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had a, Drew Boogie actually came by last night, too.  He came over.  Did he spin?  For the party.  No, he was just hanging.  Just hanging?  Watching the game.  Nice.  In the theater.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was cool.  I haven't seen him in a while.  He's looking to come back on the show. 
[01:48:30]  Do a little spinning.  We would like that.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I told him.  Get your black ass in here.  He could come in Friday.  Yeah.  Fuck waiting.  Come on in Friday with your shit.  Yeah, Drew.  With your shit.  Oh, the other news.  That's right.  Mitt Romney.  It's pretty much his to lose now, huh?  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  He won Nevada.  Nevada.  And he won it pretty decisively.  What has he won since we last broadcasted?  Florida and Nevada?  That's it?  Yeah.  Right?  It's just, it's looking like. 
[01:49:00]  What's next?  Colorado?  He's got the momentum.  Of course he does.  And then on to, uh, and then on to D.C.  I don't know what this states.  But he's doing everything the way it's been done already.  There's nothing original about the way he's doing it.  Oh, really?  That's right.  It's the same way.  Same way?  Yes.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't ask him.  What do you mean the same way?  No, no, no.  Don't ask him.  He's doing nothing original.  Yeah.  It's all cookie cutter. 
[01:49:30]  When a guy gets to go with a catchphrase.  Yeah, yeah.  The catchphrase changes a little bit after it gets popular.  Yeah.  Cookie cutter.  I was watching the Obama interview.  Oh, we got that.  And.  Did it drive you nuts?  Well, no, no.  I don't care.  You don't care anymore?  You kind of want him to stay in office.  No, I don't care today because I'm tired from staying up so late.  Yeah.  Um, but they showed him in an interview after 10 days in office and it was pretty much the 
[01:50:00]  same setup.  Right.  Uh, and they show him now and wow, he's, uh, he's aging.  What, what does the president know that makes him age so, so rapidly?  We all know.  And obviously it's, it's, is it a surprise to you?  What do you think they tell him?  Right.  It's built.  It's Bill Burr's a bit.  I think they show you the basement of the white house and shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take it downstairs.  If you could find that bit going into break, that'd be great.  Hicks does that where they, they show you Hicks, they show you, they show you, they show 
[01:50:30]  you an angle of the Kennedy assassination you've never seen.  Right.  Right.  And then you realize as president, holy fuck.  Yeah.  I'm just sitting in the seat.  You know, how did he age?  His hair is obviously going great.  Yeah.  His hair and he's getting, he's a little more ashy.  His face is a little more ashy than it was.  His color's bad.  Yeah.  He had kind of a.  Maybe he needs the happy light.  Light milk chocolatey look.  Yeah.  Back when he was first elected.  Yeah.  And now he's kind of got this ashier look to him. 
[01:51:00]  By the way, I don't want to go back to the controversy, but I'm going to.  Michelle Obama, like Joe DeRosa, doesn't know how to do a fucking proper pushup.  Thank you.  She was doing it on the Ellen DeGeneres show.  But she wasn't going 90 degrees.  That's what we learned through the process.  Who says that's a proper pushup, though?  You've got to go 90 degrees.  Marines do.  No.  Marines do.  But a lot of people could go further than 90 degrees and they could hit their chest on  the floor.  He doesn't look that bad there, right?  No, but they show, wait until they show the clip, because I guess he was talking to Matt 
[01:51:30]  Lauer in that very room.  Matt Lauer talks to him a lot.  Years ago.  Right.  And you could definitely see a difference.  He dyes his hair, it's obvious, but it goes out quickly.  Yeah, because all of a sudden he'll be on TV with much darker hair.  He has very short hair.  But he doesn't have time to dye it, I guess, every day because he keeps it tight.  If he gets another term, he's going to look like an old grandpappy when he gets out of  office with a little tuft of white beard on his chin.  I hate to say that.  See, there he is.  Whoa!  All right, I'm with you.  That's just before the election. 
[01:52:00]  All right, that's 10 days in.  He looks like a kid.  Yeah, yeah.  That's 10 days in.  He looks like he's 30.  What would you say, really?  Early 30s?  Tops?  Yeah, he looks very young there.  Holy fuck.  How old is he?  He's right around 50, I guess.  There, and there he is now.  Look, come on, dude.  That's the same fucking guy.  See?  Holy shit, you're onto something.  See?  He's, uh...  Could you split screen that somehow?  Well, just play it, because it goes from one to the other pretty quickly. 
[01:52:30]  An arms race, a nuclear arms race in a volatile region.  Three years ago, we sat for this interview on Super Bowl Sunday.  You had been president for just 10 days.  And we talked about the state of the economy, which was in dire straits.  And you said this to me, quote, if I don't have this done in three years, then it's going  to be a one-term proposition.  You got good news on Friday.  Oh, man.  Wow.  See?  He just...  His whole face and everything just looks like...  That's a rough three years.  Man.  But we do learn when the president gets out of office, he gains a few of those years back. 
[01:53:00]  He gets a few back.  Not all of them, but he...  Yeah.  All of a sudden, he looks a little younger.  It's like, uh...  What the fuck is it?  It's called the Ken Stevens syndrome.  Yeah.  Oh, Ken looked like a million bucks after he was done with us.  Oh, yeah.  What is, uh...  What is it about the job that makes him age that much, you think?  No, I mean, seriously.  What a stressful job on the planet.  Having to go to sleep at night, knowing that you've sent people to their death.  But what's the one thing you think that gets him?  Just the lack of sleep?  The overwhelmingness of the job. 
[01:53:30]  Just the stress.  Look at that.  It's overwhelming.  There's a whole bunch of before and afters now online.  It's the overwhelming nature of the job.  It's...  You're the most powerful guy on Earth.  You really are.  You control the U.S. military.  That's why you need Mimi Beardsley to take the stress off of you.  I tell you.  I tell you.  I mean, you couldn't have been president when I was, you know, because you're a you-know-what.  Bobby liked you a hell of a lot more than I did.  But I'll tell you, Mimi Beardsley would have sucked the purple right out of that cock. 
[01:54:00]  She would have sucked it until it was yellow and white.  An alabaster cock you'd have had.  Mimi Beardsley.  She would have cupped those two macadamia nuts of yours and sucked the color right off  your cock.  Fuck, man.  The presidency just sucks the moisture out of you.  It really does.  Obama looks just dry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  That's what I meant.  Like...  Wow, man.  You're right.  He's got a smooth look to him in that first pic.  He almost looks like Denzel in the first picture. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's got a Denzel look to him.  And now...  He goes from Denzel to Morgan Freeman.  Yeah.  Here's the clip worth playing, I guess, from the interview.  When was it on?  Last night before the Super Bowl?  Last night.  Three years ago, we sat for this interview on Super Bowl Sunday.  You had been president for just 10 days.  And we talked about the state of the economy, which was in dire straits.  And you said this to me, quote, if I don't have this done in three years, then it's going  to be a one-term proposition.  You got good news on Friday in terms of jobs. 
[01:55:00]  The unemployment rate went down to 8.3%.  But I think if you go out on the street and you ask average Americans, is the recovery  done?  Overwhelmingly, they will tell you it is not.  So do you deserve a second term?  I deserve a second term, but we're not done.  Look, when you and I sat down, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month.  In fact, we had found out just a few days before we sat down that we had lost that month  750,000 jobs.  Now we're creating 250,000.  We created 3.7 million jobs over the last 23 months. 
[01:55:30]  We created the most jobs since 2005, the most manufacturing jobs since 1990.  But we're not finished.  And we've got to not only boost up American manufacturing.  Are those just czars that he's appointing?  Not just the oil industry, but all American manufacturing is building again and selling  overseas.  We've got to make sure that we're pushing American energy.  And that includes not just oil and gas, but clean energy.  Oh, really?  We've got to make sure that the skills of American workers are the best in the world.  And we're making progress on that front. 
[01:56:00]  And we've got to return to old-fashioned American values.  Everybody getting a fair shot.  Everybody doing their fair share.  Everybody playing by the same rules.  And that means, for example, regulations to make sure that Wall Street has fallen the  same rules that Main Street's doing.  But we need progress.  And the key right now is just make sure that we don't start turning in a new direction  that could throw that progress.  Oh, in other words, don't elect the new guy.  Anyway, what he asked you was, you said three years ago, that if we were still in a mess, 
[01:56:30]  you were going to be a one-termer.  But they always politicize the answer to the question.  Yes.  I don't see Obama losing right now, man.  I think the economy's going to come back just in time for this election.  Gee, you think that isn't calculated?  Huh.  Of course it is.  The economy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They know how to fix these things.  Just in time?  Yeah.  Just in time.  Wow.  Well, just like a movie, isn't it?  I don't see Obama losing this at this juncture.  Yeah.  But what do I know?  Yeah.  But Newt's staying in there. 
[01:57:00]  He had a press conference just to say, look, I'm in for at least two more months.  He's fucking just annoying now.  He's a fat douchebag.  And he's always been a douchebag.  Well, shouldn't Santorum drop before Newt?  Another douchebag.  Yeah, that's true.  Shouldn't there be protocol out of respect?  Yeah.  Shouldn't the newer guy go?  And Ron Paul, you know, he just stays in there because he's got an overall message he wants  to continue with.  He's like a Ralph Nader fucking guy.  Yeah, but he's not as irrational as Nader.  Nah, I, eh. 
[01:57:30]  Well.  And he's the fucking, to me, he's the smartest guy in the entire race out of all of them.  He's the guy at least who, Newt's a pretty smart dude, but I like Ron Paul the best,  even better than Obama.  So, um, I would like to see him win, but he won't, but I'm still going to vote for  him.  Yeah.  He's the only guy I would, I would be comfortable enough having, um, his finger in my ass.  Oh.  Ron Paul.  Yeah.  I'm just thinking of them as all doctors right now.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Because Ron Paul's a doctor, so I'm thinking to myself, okay, when you see these debates, 
[01:58:00]  which guy would you comfortably allow a finger to go in your ass?  Well, he's a gyno, so, uh.  I'll just, I'm just thinking.  You want a big speculum to spread your asshole open.  I'm just thinking in doctor terms, though.  All your feet are up in those stirrups.  Would you allow Santorum if he was a doctor?  Would you allow Mitt Romney?  No.  Would you allow Newt?  Newt with his fat fingers.  Ron Paul, you could see.  Probing your anus.  Oh, okay, it's time to check the prostate.  Yeah.  Yeah, and Rick Santorum would be up there just to make sure that no cocks or other male  cum had been up there, you know.  Right.  Because he wants less government in your life. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Got to get those gays, uh, in line.  Stop them from fucking, uh.  Sure, stop them from marrying.  Stop them from marrying.  So, Tom needs to get the gays in line.  Yeah.  Those gays.  Want to get married?  Stop.  Yeah, because I guess Christ said that.  Right.  Yeah, that's what he said.  See, but it's not, uh, it's not preventing gay people from getting married, Jim.  You, you, you're all screwed up on that.  No one could do that.  You can't, uh, make an amendment to the Constitution to keep people from doing things.  It's the protection of marriage.  You know, you want to protect the sanctity of marriage. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, the sanctity.  So you're, you're protecting something.  You're not telling people they can't do something.  That would be horrible.  Cool.  So now, protecting the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman, that's what he wants  to do.  All right.  Instead of protecting the Constitution that's already there, he says that all citizens, I  believe, and I'm paraphrasing, should have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Right.  I guess under the guise of everyone getting it equally.  If a wee-wee in your coolie is making you happy and you want to pursue that, uh, feel  free, I say.  Sure. 
[01:59:30]  Feel free.  Feel free.  Take that big, juicy cock in your ass.  Sure.  How many of those guys would you allow the finger in the ass if they were doctors?  Let's go with this.  I'm just saying, fucking...  Ron Paul is a no-brainer, right?  Ron Paul.  Yeah.  Because he's, uh, he's, uh, used to the probe.  Yeah.  Is this the Bill Hicks presidential agenda thing?  Yeah.  All right, why don't we go to break with this?  When we get back, we got Steven Singer stopping by.  And his phenomenally beautiful assistant.  Yeah, she's been here in the past, and she is very, very attractive.  She's been here many times and has shown absolutely no interest in you two. 
[02:00:00]  But I don't know about that.  I've never tried.  I just want to go on record and say that.  What do you mean, us two?  I'm single.  No, that doesn't mean me.  I'm taken.  I'm single.  You guys were working it.  A girl could be interested, even if you're taken.  No, but you guys were working it.  Were we?  That's all I'm saying.  I never tried to ask her out, but I'm going to this time.  So think of an excuse in the office right now.  Because I'm going to ask you out for a dinner engagement.  We're all going to watch Jimmy's game play out.  Yeah, I'm going to say something like, perhaps you and I could take in some din-din. 
[02:00:30]  Maybe Steven will let you get the next day off.  You're crashing and burning.  That's good.  Hey, maybe you and I could go out for a bowl of soup.  How about a steak on me?  Wow.  I'd love to treat you for some din-din.  Let's go Dutch.  I don't go Dutch.  No.  I'll say that to her.  I don't go Dutch, but I'll kind of point at my zipper when I say that.  You know, I don't go Dutch and I'll point.  She'll get it.  And I'll say to the words Mimi Beardsley. 
[02:01:00]  Mimi Beardsley would have got what that gesture was all about.  Is she an idol of yours, by the way?  You look up to her.  What would you do in the presidential pool if Dave Powers was stressed?  Yeah.  Good old Dave Powers.  Would you A, just go for a swim and not think about the question?  Suck his cock.  Yes.  Or C, give him a massage.  Yeah.  Start cleaning the skimmers.  Oh, imagine cleaning the fucking Kennedy School skimmers.  Holy shit.  It looks like egg drop soup was dumped in there.  Looked like a jellyfish aquarium. 
[02:01:30]  Pool boys were just fucking quitting left and right.  I can't deal with this shit anymore.  That's funny.  Where was the pool?  They got rid of the pool?  Is that one of those things where a president comes in and goes,  ah, we don't need the fucking pool anymore?  No, there's got to be a pool.  Is there a pool at the White House?  Yeah.  Maybe it's indoor.  Yeah.  Hey, a little breaking news about Super Bowl.  Giselle bashes Tom's teammates.  Uh-oh.  While waiting for the elevator to leave the VIP suites at Lucas Oil Stadium,  Giselle said, my husband cannot fucking throw the ball 
[02:02:00]  and catch the ball at the same time.  I can't believe they dropped the ball so many times.  That's what Jimmy says.  She's right.  But now they're like, oh, you shouldn't say that,  and they should wash your mouth out with soap.  Yeah, for speaking the truth.  In football, I guess you shouldn't say what actually happened.  Yeah.  He threw the ball and they dropped it.  Yes, you should say that.  If you throw it high enough and far enough,  you probably could catch it too.  Supposedly she's on video saying this thing.  I'll take you, I don't know, B-R-Y-N-A-Y-L-O-R. 
[02:02:30]  Might get you one follower for sending that to us, I guess.  Tough one to remember.  No one's going to follow them from that.  I know.  I forgot it.  I'm right here in front of you.  I know.  I know.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you pick something easy?  Silly name.  Mimi Beardsley tweeted me.  I bet there's already a Mimi Beardsley.  I hope there is.  Can you find out if there's a Mimi Beardsley on Twitter?  If she's sucking the cock of at D powers.  The pool became the press room?  The press room. 
[02:03:00]  They should have kept the water in it.  What a waste.  Oh, boy.  They're probably pressing a lot of...  Whatever.  You make your own jokes.  Ah, no.  No, Chip.  No.  No.  Oh, his cold arm.  I don't have a man crush on Ron Paul.  He's an old fucker.  It's okay if you do.  It's a lot.  He's very fatherly.  He's very comforting, that guy.  It's a man crush.  Fine.  It's not a man crush.  No big deal. 
[02:03:30]  Why is my voice getting higher?  Yeah, because that's the way you are.  Older gentleman.  Yeah.  Understandable.  I like Ron Paul.  I just don't think the country's ready for Ron Paul.  No, we're not.  Unfortunately.  They're not.  You know, it's going to be Romney.  It's going to be Obama.  And Obama wins.  Yeah, period.  Well.  Four more years.  Because Romney cannot fucking connect with people.  Even though they should take.  You're right, he can't.  He can't connect with people.  Every president has been able to connect with the people.  He reminds me of Al Gore.  Who was the last president that couldn't connect with the people? 
[02:04:00]  Carter?  I don't know.  Reagan, obviously.  Every man.  Clinton, obviously.  Even Bush.  No, Carter had that southern.  Yeah.  Was he connecting?  Yeah.  I guess he smiled a lot.  Yeah, he got the regular Joe.  People like Jimmy Carter.  People, yeah, yeah.  He was a working guy.  A working farmer.  He was just a friend of the Shah of Iran, which caused Islamic radicals to hate us.  And that's what had the hostages taken.  Bush Sr. connected.  You know, Bush, he connected too, I guess, right? 
[02:04:30]  George W.  George W.  George W. might have been a little out of touch with the people.  But when he talked, he made fun of himself.  He made mistakes.  There was something very, very relatable about, but he was a very underrated politician.  Romney makes me so uncomfortable every time he talks, and I don't know why.  And it's not the substance of what he's saying.  It's just how he says it.  No one wants to talk to a big-headed Mormon guy.  Mormon.  Fucking millionaire?  Seems like he's uncomfortable in his own skin half the fucking time. 
[02:05:00]  What are your boys saying, Ed?  They like this Romney guy.  It's one of those, you know, you got to vote for him if you're a Republican.  If you want Obama out of office, you got to vote for him.  A lot of you guys secretly wishing the candidate was a little stronger?  Yeah, who wouldn't want a stronger candidate?  Did anybody see the Bloomberg and Menino thing?  About the anti-gun thing that they're doing?  The way Menino says patriotic is fucking patriotic. 
[02:05:30]  Patriotic.  Patriotic.  Can we do it after the break, Ed?  Do you mind?  Yeah, sure.  And we'll get Steven Singer in here.  Mitt Romney is coming to New York, by the way.  He's going to tie up traffic and speak in New York.  So if you want to go watch Mitt Romney, you can see him March 29th through April 1st at Caroline's on Broadway, where I will have half a house, I'm sure.  Well.  No, that curtain will be fucking open and people to the back. 
[02:06:00]  I'm going to that one.  People to the back.  We'll do the Boston thing, Mayor Menino, Bloomberg thing after the break.  Yeah.  I have this feeling, man, because you know there's a handful of people actually run everything.  That's true.  It's provable.  It's not a fuck.  I'm not a conspiracy nut.  It's provable.  Handful.  Very small elite run and own these corporations, which include the mainstream media.  I have this feeling who's ever elected president, like Clinton was, no matter what your promises you promise on the campaign trail, blah, blah, blah.  When you win, you go into this smoky room with the 12 industrialist, capitalist scum fucks who got you in there. 
[02:06:30]  And you're in this smoky room and this little film screen comes down and a big guy in a cigar, roll the film.  And it's a shot of a Kennedy assassination from an angle you've never seen before.  It looks suspiciously off the grassy knoll.  And then the film, the screen goes up and the lights come up and they go to the new president. 
[02:07:00]  Any questions?  Just what my agenda is.  First we bomb Baghdad.  You got it.  We want to welcome Stephen Singer to the radio show with his lovely assistant, Leanne. 
[02:07:30]  Look how nice.  Hello, Stephen.  Oh, I guess you're going to sit with the big boys, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm glad we have room for Stephen and we don't bring a seat for Leanne.  Yeah, what the hell's going on?  Beat it, Sam.  Beat it.  There goes Sam.  She doesn't want to?  Why don't you want to?  How come nobody's talking about Sam's show yesterday?  Yeah.  Because we were all watching the pregame.  Yeah, way before.  I'm listening to Sam and all of a sudden, off the air.  Did you guys hear that? 
[02:08:00]  They yanked him?  No, it was like wacky.  I don't know.  I heard some announcement that was going on over and over again.  It was like Mad Dog Russo or something cut in in the middle.  It was the way I'm listening.  I think he's telling a great story about shopping carts and Target and his wife and  Kmart shopping.  It was Target or Kmart?  Target.  I wish he was telling a story about how he was walking and a shopping cart was thrown  off a ledge onto him.  That's been happening lately.  Yes.  It was actually pretty good.  It was a pretty good rap.  And then all of a sudden, bam, he's off the air.  And thrown off by Mad Dog Russo. 
[02:08:30]  Why on this station was Mad Dog Russo?  It was a promo.  And I don't know.  Something I fucked up.  Did something weird.  You should get some money back, Stephen Singer.  I think so.  I think so.  Yeah, I get a credit, right?  The product got a little fucked up, so I think you should get a credit.  Absolutely.  Now, Sam's my man.  Although, he says on my spot, he's not my friend.  Well, you don't want anyone to be your friend.  It's called I Hate Stephen Singer.  No, but he says, go see my friend, Stephen Singer.  He goes, although he's not my friend.  You know, he's not on Facebook.  He's like, I'm not gay with him. 
[02:09:00]  I don't tweet with him.  I don't do whatever the hell he does on whatever he does anywhere.  So you're the one listening to Sam's show?  I like Sam.  I like Sam and E-Rock and Kenny.  I like him.  You like anyone that buys some jewelry?  I like anybody who buys any kind of crap.  Coincidentally.  I got to say, I haven't talked to Stephen Singer on the air since I went down there and  finally checked out the operation.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Really impressive.  Although, I feel like I can now break into your store.  There you go.  Because you gave me all the behind-the-scenes secrets. 
[02:09:30]  Sure.  I gave you the backstage tour.  It was amazing.  Go in there and spray paint the camera lenses.  Yeah, everybody thinks it's figured out.  You know, like a mom and pop.  Like, there's a guy named Irving doing watch batteries or something like that.  You know, it's a little bit more than that.  We've, much like yourselves, we've built up a little following there over the years.  How large is the safe again?  The vault weighs 22 tons.  22 tons.  It's a class two bank vault.  You rock a teeter-totter with it. 
[02:10:00]  Well, we were building it.  I said, is this the floor?  You know, we're building it.  It has six foot of reinforced steel and concrete.  And I said, the guy, is this going to hold this?  He goes, yeah, it holds you, don't it?  You know, it's going to be fine.  Don't worry about it.  It's going to be great.  It's a cool operation.  You obviously put that safe in there?  We built the whole thing.  How the fuck do they do that?  22 tons.  We cut out a big section of floor, and they lowered a forklift in there, and 15 guys.  We called them riggers.  Oh, no.  Riggers.  That's not hard.  Rigger.  Wow, that was close.  We had to build it around the building, and then the rest of it went up.  Unbelievable. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, it's a pretty cool.  22 tons.  Anthony's the only one I can't get down.  I can't get to come down to the store.  I've never come down to the store.  Well, you know what?  I don't have the need to really get engaged.  Yeah.  No, but he's got a...  It's a lot of good weekends, though.  You don't have to actually go through with it.  He's got other shit.  He took care of me recently on a couple fronts.  Yes, I did.  I do have to get down there.  Can you call me for some emergency stuff?  I need an emergency Christmas gift.  I got that emergency Christmas gift.  Didn't have to pay a fucking dime, because that's what I do. 
[02:11:00]  I'll make my way down to the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  Thank you.  You know the address?  Of course.  There you go.  It's the other corner.  Not that one.  The other one.  We know what that is.  Did you bring any loose diamonds for me today?  I'm running out.  I got a whole soup crutch box full of loose diamonds for you to give out to the guys.  I'm running out.  That's it.  Make them eat them like Olivier.  That's it.  Right.  That's it.  More.  One thing, though, for the guys trying to stay in shape, you got to get rid of the fucking  cookies.  Please, sir.  We got sugar-free ones, too.  You sit down.  We have our own little oven. 
[02:11:30]  Got to have a good cookie.  They work cookies while you're sitting there.  Really?  Yeah, and I'm like, you can't help yourself.  You can't have just one.  No.  Fresh-baked chocolate chip.  What's that?  Peanut butter, I think I had.  Sugar cookies.  Oatmeal raisin.  I'm like, I just want to pick out something for my wife.  It's a jewelry store.  You know, listen.  Much like the operation you guys have here at the CXXN with the beautiful.  I've watched the deterioration.  What's it?  Four years you're here?  Three.  Three.  Three years.  I've watched the deterioration over the last three or four years. 
[02:12:00]  Exactly.  You know, each time I come here, it's worse and worse and worse.  Isn't it?  Can't you explain that to the dickhead down the hall?  It's unbelievable.  The green room's gone.  Green room?  That's our office.  They got a refrigerator filled with water.  The refrigerator don't work.  It's all piss warm.  It's like frigging camel piss in there.  You want a water store?  It's like camel piss.  Yeah, how come we can't have cold water?  We're not allowed to plug it in.  It's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable.  If we plug in the refrigerator, it will blow a fuse. 
[02:12:30]  Why?  Wait, we're not allowed to plug in our refrigerator?  No.  Is that why our water is piss warm?  And that's why your personal refrigerator is outside the office a little bit down the hallway?  Holy shit.  Because the office can't do the two TVs and the computers and the fridge.  The only thing I can think is the contract.  You three must be making a boatload of money.  They're saving the infrastructure here, right?  Really?  Because, I mean, they have spared no...  If you guys, anybody in the listening audience, you would see this studio and you would see what's going on here. 
[02:13:00]  Well, you remember our old studio, right?  It was beautiful.  The other thing was magnificent.  Listen to me, singer.  What a giant step downhill this is.  Our biggest advertiser notices.  Yeah, that's good.  Unbelievable.  Singer, listen.  It's obvious that you spent a lot of money with this company, right?  Yes, I do.  So why don't you go walk down the hall and talk to that dickhead and represent us?  Because he doesn't get it.  He doesn't get that they're taking everything away from us.  My hand to God, one of the things, when you came, I said, listen, how long is our contract?  I want to sign a deal as long as our contract. 
[02:13:30]  And I said, how come it's so short?  I said, if they're so good, if they're sitting in your investment, why don't let's make it longer?  That's our choice, always.  And they said, listen, this is it.  They're definitely going to be here.  And then I said, I want a contract.  If something happens, if something's a miracle, they go away somehow.  I know everything's peachy.  Everybody's lovey-dove.  Everything's great.  I said, we're spending a lot of money.  I'm investing a lot of money in this infrastructure.  I want to make sure I get money back.  I said, what happens if they bolt?  What happens if something happens? 
[02:14:00]  In the unlikely event, not that it's never happened before.  Right.  And they said, go pound, basically.  Go pound.  Go pound.  Yeah, that's good.  Go pound.  Nice.  I don't really hold any clap.  But could you seriously walk down the hall and explain to these idiots?  Because we gave up.  There's nothing else we can say to them.  I think, to me, they should treat talent like God.  You guys are funny.  Four hours a day.  Five days a week.  Yeah, five days a week.  One after another. 
[02:14:30]  I was listening to one of the replays last week.  God, this guy likes to talk.  Go ahead.  I love you guys.  I like what he said.  And I was listening to the list of what you said management said.  You had to do more impressions.  I don't know what it was for.  They say to do more of this.  And every freaking thing is wrong.  It's like, here's a playbook of how to screw up the show.  Right.  Do this, and you'll screw everything up.  Did they say that?  More impressions?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When did this happen?  I remember that.  How long ago was this?  That was a while ago.  It was a replay.  You were playing, like, best, you know, like, worst of the week.  Yeah, yeah, it was a while ago, but there were certain things.  Chiasano used to tell us that. 
[02:15:00]  Like, yeah, what you got to do is, you know, more impressions and sound effects.  More sound effects.  All right.  He was so big on wanting sound effects.  Like, when we would talk about something, there had to be some kind of fucking sound that was playing.  Yeah.  Like, oh.  Be more funny.  Is someone at the door?  Oh.  In person.  Well, someone's at the door.  Who on earth could that be?  Good evening.  Well, we used to have a great setup.  Yeah.  They don't understand that it does affect the product. 
[02:15:30]  I hear it would be, this would be my playbook for you guys.  If I read the show.  And then what?  Hire Opie and Anthony.  Leave him the fuck alone.  Let him do whatever they want.  That's it.  God, dream come true.  That's it.  They sort of do that, but they do take everything away.  Yeah.  They take everything away.  So is that leaving us the fuck alone?  When they say no, everything we suggest, and they hide us in a corner, I guess that's  kind of letting us do our own thing to the extreme.  Do you realize you're looking at a show that was not invited to the Super Bowl, even though  they had a massive presence down there?  I know. 
[02:16:00]  Massive.  Not a little presence.  A massive presence.  And then they stand outside the door like the zombies at a mall waiting to get us when  we walk out.  Like, just, I don't want to fucking talk.  Yeah, because they have nothing to say.  It's terrible.  At this point, I don't believe anything they say to me.  It's wacky.  You know, and I just watch it from and forth, because I see a little bit of the inside stuff  and a little bit of the outside stuff as a listener.  Yeah.  And it just cracks me up.  It's just unbelievable.  It's like, how to screw it up.  Thank you.  They make it so complicated. 
[02:16:30]  It's the easiest fucking gig in the world, and they somehow make it really hard.  Right.  There's so many things that are screwed up that they really should do something with,  but the stuff that works, just leave it alone.  Let them just do their thing and leave it alone.  Say I'm sorry every few months for something to happen, and go on.  That's it.  Yeah.  Hey, did you watch the Super Bowl?  I did.  I did.  Are you a Giants fan, sort of?  Listen, if anybody from Philly hates everybody else.  We hate the Giants.  We hate the Pats.  We're bitter.  Probably hate the Giants more than the Pats?  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Right?  Eagles fans?  I have a few guys that work for me that are actually from New York, that are big Giants fans,  so they were like, they want to wear the Giants jerseys yesterday, and everybody's like pissing them on me.  What are you all, Eagles?  You're all about Eagles?  Yeah, we're like Philly.  We're like diehard Eagles.  It doesn't matter how many times we get screwed and lose, but it was all right.  But I'm always burnt out because I'm working so hard for Valentine's Day, so I can't enjoy this.  Well, that's true.  I had to work yesterday, so.  You are.  You're working.  You've got that free shipping going on. 
[02:17:30]  It's crazy what Steven Singer does.  It's just amazing.  It is wild.  For his customers.  Why isn't Leanne talking?  Well, she was disappointed.  You know, for the last three, four years that she's been coming here and seeing you guys here and the other joint and all that stuff, nobody ever asked her out.  Now today, finally, you guys finally woke up, got this beautiful, hot, smart, blonde, gorgeous girl, but now she's engaged.  They're leaving a dollar short.  She just got engaged at Christmas.  Didn't matter to Mimi Beardsley.  Exactly.  You know, it's funny. 
[02:18:00]  My ex-girlfriend and I are still friends, and she said the one thing she saved from, like, one of, was the fucking rose that I gave her.  From Steven Singer?  Yeah, she had it up there.  Oh, you just sold a shitload of roses.  No, no, I really mean that.  And she said something about how she kept it there, and if I started fucking someone, she would have just taken it, got rid of it.  And plunged it into your eye?  Yes.  Yeah, it's exactly it.  I think it was a red one.  That's the, what is that, the sapphire? 
[02:18:30]  That is the sapphire, the royal sapphire rose.  That's nice.  That's a blue one.  Yes.  It's very nice, man.  That's good.  And the traditional red rose.  Are they real roses?  They are real roses.  How do you get your roses to look so nice?  Didn't you step on one one year and crack it open?  Oh, I wouldn't do that to your product, sir.  This is the lovely apple green rose.  Apple green.  Green with envy.  Almost sold out.  Wow.  But, yeah, these are great.  Why don't you make more if they're selling out every year?  Well, because we're not that bright.  Here's the thing.  I'm going to tell you how it works.  We know how many we're going to sell every year, about. 
[02:19:00]  Good ones.  About, right.  Especially the red ones.  The red, we make up tons of.  The gold, the traditional one, we make up tons.  So we almost never, I don't want to say never, but almost never run out of this.  But every year we introduce a new color.  So last year was the royal sapphire you guys talked about.  This year's the green apple.  But you don't know how many you're going to sell, so you make 10,000, let's say.  Well, like January, we pre-sold 9,000.  You know what I mean?  People were like crazy because everybody, they collect them, they make a bouquet.  And guys are much like us. 
[02:19:30]  They're stupid.  You know what I mean?  So it's an easy, no-brainer type of gift.  So call the sweatshop and get them to make more.  It takes a year to build the inventory.  Now, she sent this to me on January 28th.  Yeah.  This is the, because she moved to L.A.  Right.  She writes, this is the only keepsake I'm taking with me.  Oh, look at that.  That's a picture of the rose.  And it's the rose you gave me.  Oh.  Well, send her another one.  We'll give her another one today.  How are you thinking of it?  I have kept that rose near my bed, and every black guy that has...  Don't forget it. 
[02:20:00]  Just lost the text.  Yes.  And actually, in the intro to the Alive from the Compound show, Melissa is using it as  a bookmark for Jimmy's book.  There you go.  And she opens it up and takes the rose out and starts reading Jimmy's book.  Isn't that nice?  Yeah.  I'd give this to a girl.  I'd be like, here, rose is for you.  Why would that be funny?  Why would you laugh, Chip?  I don't know.  You're giving her a nice rose, and she doesn't know why you're giggling like a homicidal maniac. 
[02:20:30]  Hey, Steven Singer, you ever have a gun in your face?  You ever been robbed?  I have never.  I mean, I have a permit to carry.  Yeah.  I don't have an arsenal like you.  You're a jewelry store owner.  You should.  But, just for that reason, but no, we never had, we did have one time, many years ago,  a guy came in with a bag and said he had a gun.  Jesus.  But he was mentally disturbed, and he only had a finger inside a bag.  Oh, yeah, that old gag.  And he didn't get, you know, you could tell he wasn't, he was about nine cents short of 
[02:21:00]  a dime, and the police were there in, like, ten seconds.  We have 24-hour, seven-day-week police on George Rowe in Philadelphia.  Hey, do you know when someone walks in that something fishy is up like there?  You must have, like, a sixth sense like that?  You just know?  Well, the same way we all know.  Yeah.  I mean, you do know most of the time.  Not 100%, obviously.  You do know most of the time.  But we have a ton, as Opie can tell you, we have a ton of security that people don't  see that's kind of hidden behind.  You ain't going to get anything done there.  Yeah, yeah.  We have a lot of cool stuff that's going on. 
[02:21:30]  But, you know, that's the one thing that's great.  George Rowe is the oldest jewelry district in the United States and second largest.  And it's actually the first shopping district in the United States.  Not that anybody cares.  What's the biggest?  What's the largest?  New York?  The largest is New York.  New York is more wholesale.  And Philadelphia is more to the end user.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that is the end user.  Yeah, well, we have 351 stores that sell to the public.  I want to prove I was listening to you that day. 
[02:22:00]  When there's jewelry on display in the windows, I learned that jewelry is sort of, eh.  What?  Because I always thought you would just fucking, you know, break the glass and grab and run.  Yeah.  But it's kind of...  Well, we have a nice display of stuff in the windows.  But the windows, we have 8, 10, 24 windows, show windows.  So each one only doesn't have that much in it.  But they're all bulletproof glass.  Oh.  And they all have gates that come down.  But you told me in some places, some of that jewelry is kind of like crappy. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, some places they put in synthetic stuff or imitation stuff that, you know, they don't have to worry about.  Like in the malls and certain things like that.  But we, like I said, we're lucky because we have our own police station right on George Row.  Wow, that's handy.  Yeah, it's very smart.  I like the Starbucks across the street, too.  You got a Starbucks.  Got a lot of good-looking girls.  Those Philly cops don't fuck around either.  No.  They will rack ahead.  They will fuck you up.  I've never been to your store.  Maybe I'll go.  No, it does sound like something we should do.  Now that you're not doing any New York dates, maybe you'll come to Philly. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  You're not far from the Borgata.  You're down the shore all the time.  I know.  We're only an hour away.  I do the Borgata once a year with guys who draw, so I appear to draw as well.  Really smart way of being a barnacle.  Jimmy's down on the audience.  No, I'm accurate.  Believe me.  I'm not feeling sorry for myself.  Well, I told you this before.  I've seen you more than once, and you killed.  Thank you.  And it was great.  You're a nice man.  No, no.  Really unbelievable how, I mean, one after another, after another, how friggin' funny he is.  And he just kills. 
[02:23:30]  He's just really, really funny.  And it's not the same show.  Each time.  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy actually writes.  I have some old Bobbitt jokes I'm doing now.  Oh, nice.  Keep it up to date.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  Should we announce the winner of the best man speech thing we did?  I think so.  The worst man?  Steven Singer has got some cash.  The best worst man speech?  How do we say it?  Yep.  Yeah, you put up the money, right?  Yes, we did.  That's pretty sweet of you right there.  A thousand?  Listen, yeah.  We're happy to do it.  We're happy to do it, man.  A thousand cash. 
[02:24:00]  Cashish.  Yes.  And I think I know which one it is, but.  Well, where's the disc?  Is it my favorite one?  I think, yeah.  Did he hear anything?  There was one.  I did.  I was listening, absolutely.  I'm anxious to hear who the winner is.  That was outstanding, yes.  Well, I think it's down to two.  Two, huh?  Yeah.  How do we figure out which one is which?  Play them both.  Yeah?  Play them both.  Yeah, there's no production on them, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So, you want to decide, Stephen?  Is it in the rules, or are we fucking this up? 
[02:24:30]  Oh, boy.  I think you can decide.  Is it in the rules?  The show.  They get really excited if we don't follow the rules, word for word.  The show decides, and today, Stephen Singer is a part of the show.  Are you part of the show?  Sure.  Well, there's five people, so why don't we vote?  There you go.  Take a secret ballot.  Majority.  No, put our hands up.  What about Leanne?  Oh, well.  Oh, you know what?  That's right.  Leanne is six.  She's a person.  Yeah, but she'll be three-fifths of a vote.  Oh.  Oh, Leanne.  No, that's right.  I forgot about Leanne.  It's one, two, three, four, five, six, plus E-Rock is 14. 
[02:25:00]  So, E-Rock can be seven.  E-Rock, you want in on the voting?  Four.  You have to be in on the voting.  We need you.  All right.  So, it's between Wayne, it looks like Menech, and Sean Ryan.  So, I'm going to play Wayne's first.  I think it's Menech.  Menech?  Menech-y?  Menech-y, maybe?  What's the matter?  You got a crank in it?  Let's go with Menech-y.  You're right, because I see the E at the end, so you might have to pronounce that.  Oh, Chip.  Menech-y.  Oh, I hate when Chip does that.  I told you how bad it was.  Oh, it's terrible.  For the $1,000, courtesy of Steven Singer, is this our winner? 
[02:25:30]  Oh, what can I say about my brother Wayne and his new wife, Suzanne?  I'm not saying he's an ugly kid or anything, but when he was born, my father slapped my mother.  Yeah, when he was growing up, he was a pretty ugly kid.  He was so ugly, when he worked at the pet shop, they used to ask him how big he'd get.  But he doesn't look anything like he used to, though.  When it's been about five years since he stuck his head out the window and got arrested for mooning. 
[02:26:00]  Seriously, though, he's a good-looking guy now, but I know why tigers eat their young.  Suzanne's a good, uh, really, I can't believe you picked Suzanne as a wife.  It's what a great choice.  Suzanne is one of the smartest girls you'll ever meet.  She got into a car accident the other day.  She hit a tree.  She said it wasn't her fault.  She blew the horn.  And Suzanne, Suzanne, Suzanne, what a sweet girl. 
[02:26:30]  She's one of the sweetest girls you'll ever meet.  When she was ten years old, her father bought her a bow and arrow set.  She turns around and she buys him a t-shirt with a bullseye in the back.  And, Wayne, if you're worried about getting a good meal every night, don't.  Suzanne is the best cook.  The best cook ever.  But, uh, I don't know.  I don't think Meatloaf's supposed to go all in the dark.  What do you guys think?  And if they had an I-can't-be-for-everyone, of course.  If they had a dog, he'd probably be the only one that begs for Alka-Seltzer. 
[02:27:00]  And, uh,  to go over the house the other day,  open up the cabinet, the cockroach, to hang themselves.  Not to mention all the flies shipped in and got their screens fixed.  What?  Shit.  Uh.  This is your fault.  Uh.  Hold on, hold on.  This is my speech.  Okay.  Nobody wants to hear it. 
[02:27:30]  Uh, but nobody wants to hear it.  Before I continue.  You know, um.  Some horrible ant in the room.  I love you both very much.  And I do want to wish you the best health, love, and happiness that your marriage can offer.  And with that, Dwayne and Suzanne.  Salud.  Salud.  Salud.  Uh, Jimmy pointed out a lot of Rodney, uh, danger.  All Rodney.  All of it.  Yeah.  Every single one, right?  Every single one.  Done poorly, too.  Rodney would deliver those better now.  Yeah.  He's dead. 
[02:28:00]  Terrible.  Truly terrible.  Yeah.  That was just.  So it looks like Sean Ryan's gonna win this thing.  You know.  Let's not fake this.  You think that was bad.  Yeah.  And then there's another one.  Yeah.  That was just poorly done.  But, like, I don't know.  He was an ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy is just.  So.  This next guy is just out of his mind.  All right.  So it's either gonna be the guy we heard.  Wayne Menecki.  Or this guy, Sean Ryan.  All right.  Here's Sean. 
[02:28:30]  First, I like to give praise to L.L.  That is a good one.  Second, what the fuck were you thinking getting married on football Sunday?  You're lucky the Jets are off.  I won't be here, you goddamn dumb dumpster.  Also, what's so special about this fuck?  Under 75 bucks?  Are you kidding me?  Damn, for that price, the pants should have gained with a built-in major sucking the... 
[02:29:00]  You know, most guys change when they date someone for a while.  But now in this case, Sean's the same fuck pirate I've known for years.  For those of you that don't know Sean too well, here's a few words to describe him.  Dick Smoker, Shirt Burdler, great guy.  Knob Jockey, good friend, ass genie, and finally Captain Cornhole. 
[02:29:30]  In fact, this is the first motherfucker I've ever seen wearing tongue gutters.  Tongue gutters.  There's so many funny stories with this tongue guzzler.  Whether it was getting hammered at parties to steal people's family photos,  or just drinking and pranking the phone book.  We always had a good time.  I don't know if you remember the time we were at a party and I was walking down the steps,  but I heard a rumble.  Before I had a chance to turn around, I was knocked down the steps and still dropped beer by. 
[02:30:00]  I get up and who knocked me down?  Sean.  He fell down the steps, took me down with him.  And there was a time also when the movie was released before the start.  He tries to run and grab a drink real quick before the movie starts.  He falls down those steps too, in front of like 60 people.  Sean's not the most graceful person in the world.  But it's not his fault, the best part of him was swallow. 
[02:30:30]  Shannon, I honestly don't know where you've seen him.  Don't be still thinks wrestling is real.  In fact, he wants to wrestle again.  Nothing like prancing around a ring with tights on and a tulip in your ear,  playing versus sausage with grown-ass men.  But in all seriousness, Sean has always been there for me.  No matter what I needed, he's been there.  Even at the time I was at prime time, I was about to get in a fight with a bunch of guys. 
[02:31:00]  I called up Sean, and he was sleeping.  But he didn't even ask why or for what reason, he just showed up.  He showed up looking like Elvis with his hair all screwed up while he was there.  And the guys ended up leaving anyhow, but it was just an example.  He did it no matter what.  In conclusion, Sean, you're the best friend I've ever had.  We had so many great times together.  You know I've always been there for you. 
[02:31:30]  You're lucky to marry Shannon.  She's truly a great catch.  You have yourself a great wife here.  I'm so happy for you guys.  I wish you the best of luck.  Everybody raise your glass and toast the newlyweds.  Fucking classic.  Yeah, that guy.  Cum gutters.  The only guy who has cum gutters.  Yeah, it's fucking brilliant.  It's at a fucking wedding.  I like how they went to house parties and just stole the family photos. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, he tells a little story of falling down the stairs and it goes nowhere.  It's terrible stories.  I like where he calls to, I need your help.  And he got out of bed, but then the guys went home anyway.  The guys went home anyway, but he was there.  You know.  Well, that's Sean Ryan.  Yeah.  That guy fucking ruled.  I'm voting for Sean.  What do we got here?  Praise Allah.  I'm voting for Sean.  Sean.  Yeah, he's got my vote.  Sean.  Just for the amount of cum references in a single wedding speech, it should be Sean. 
[02:32:30]  Brilliant.  All right.  I think Sean wins the contest.  Well, E-Rock might have a vote.  It doesn't matter at this point unless we're giving him six votes.  I'm voting for cum gutters.  It has to be a unanimous decision.  So Sean White wins the $1,000 courtesy of I Hate Stephen Sagan.  Sean Ryan.  Sean.  Oh, Sean Ryan.  Sean Ryan.  Sean Ryan.  Sean Ryan, of course.  Well, he's going to have a nice Valentine's Day.  Does the second place guy get anything, Sam?  Absolutely.  He's going to get a gold-dipped rose. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  And I'll tell you what else.  I'll show you I'm in the right spirit.  We'll give him an Argentium diamond heart necklace.  How's that?  Whoa.  Argentium and diamond?  Wow.  This, by the way, is the new super silver.  Yeah, I've heard all about it.  Argentium.  Yes.  There you go.  It's actually brighter than sterling silver or platinum.  Yeah.  See, I have him brainwashed.  I am so in his head at this point.  And he's dying to be mean to me.  And he's saying, I'm a sponsor.  I'll be nice.  I'm going to be polite.  He's very, very courageous.  I really like it. 
[02:33:30]  I love.  Yeah, look at that.  I hate Stephen Singer.  That's Argentium.  Wow, that is cool.  Very nice.  Wow, let me see that.  There you go.  Brighter and whiter.  Wow, look at that.  All right.  I like things that are whiter.  Very, very feminine.  I think we have to go to break because we have some Valentine's Day reads.  If it's not for Stephen Singer, you might want to leave the studio for a few minutes.  Oh, listen.  It's all right.  We've got to sell other crap, too.  All right.  You guys need other things.  All right.  So we'll take a quick break.  We'll continue with IHateStephensSinger.com.  That's how I fucking do it. 
[02:34:00]  I love it.  But first, Black History Month.  Continue.  For Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of the individuals whose  contributions have shaped the African-American community and changed all of us for the better.  Today, we salute Blue Ivy Carter.  In only a few days on Earth, Blue Ivy became the youngest featured artist on a major billboard song.  Her birth was so important to the world at large, all of their births were put on hold as less significant parents appropriately waited to visit their newborns. 
[02:34:30]  Welcome to the world's blue ivy.  And thank you for being born perfect.  Stay tuned as we continue to recognize significant African-American contributions for Black History Month here on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:35:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Steven Singer in studio today showing off his roses.  They look terrific this year.  I got to tell you.  Yes, very bright and colorful.  Those are the ones that go quickly.  Can I read a tweet?  Would you mind?  You're about honesty, right?  Go for it.  All right.  This is from Trucker's Elfish, I guess. 
[02:35:30]  Opie, I hate Steven Singer.  Thank you.  My bitch heard you all talk about him.  And now the earmuffs over there.  Earmuffs.  Uh-oh.  Now the cunt wants something from his shop.  Thanks, Opie.  You cost me money.  There you go.  But at least you gained some good clients.  Right.  At least we have a classy listener base.  Fly and tell right there.  Yeah, exactly.  Ted Bundy called.  You know, what better than a bashing woman over the head with a gold rose?  And we got that.  That's very nice.  It's very nice, right? 
[02:36:00]  Absolutely.  You used to hear.  We have a dozen or so people answering the phones in the morning when you guys are on.  Oh.  And due to science and technology, we know about when you're going to do the spots, depending  on how the brakes and stuff go.  Right.  So we track that.  And it's always funny because you get the ONA listeners call up and they are in a class  of their own.  Yes.  You can tell.  First of all, they go, I don't know where the hell the other corner of 8th and 1.  He told me I know where the other corner of 8th and 1.  Where the hell is 8th and 1?  Or he told me just to dial all these numbers and letters. 
[02:36:30]  I don't know how to dial.  There's too many letters.  And he told me just to do it.  And they take it literally.  And the operator, oh, I'm sorry, sir.  I'm sorry.  Well, yes.  Oh, my God.  And it's five minutes of calming them down.  Yeah.  Right.  And then sometimes they say, why are you with it online?  I just wanted to call.  Oh.  And it's the greatest.  Yeah, I wanted to call.  I wanted to talk to Steven.  Do you notice we're passionate?  Do you notice when we drop libraries?  When you drop.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Let me go to Robert in New York.  Robert.  Hey there, Bab.  What's going on?  Hey, Robert. 
[02:37:00]  How are you?  I was hoping because the Giants couldn't kick an extra point, so I'm broke.  I was wondering if I could have a free rose for my girlfriend for Valentine's Day.  What?  Oh, put Steven on the spot.  I'd say absolutely sure.  Whoa.  Really?  Just like that?  Why not?  We're going to give it away.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Now, wait a second.  It only comes in a set with a box, and the box is $69.  But you can have the rose for free.  Ba-na-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Now, you can certainly.  We will.  Let's give away some roses for Valentine's Day. 
[02:37:30]  Nice.  How about we give a dozen or two dozen away between now and Valentine's Day?  Oh, my God.  What do you think?  That's pretty good.  That means a lot of work for us, Steven.  Well, you do it any way you want.  If you plunk down the phones and somebody has a pulse, you know what I mean?  Give it to them.  He just thinks, ah, it's kind of a lot of work.  A lot of work.  I mean, you say these things, and then you leave, and we have to fucking do all the work.  Listen, I'm going to give you the roses.  You can do it.  The only thing I want to tell everybody is guys are notoriously stupid, and they wait  until the last minute.  And I bet you if I would poll the people in this room that have to buy a Valentine's Day  gift for someone, that you probably have not gotten a card, you probably have not gotten 
[02:38:00]  a gift, and you probably have not done anything.  Even though you tell everybody every day, get some hoodie footies, get some flowers, get  something so you don't look like a schmuck.  Before we say goodbye to this guy, why did you lose money in the Super Bowl?  What kind of point spread were you working with?  No, see, this is what happened.  I had 7-2, and the Giants opt to kick the extra point and not go for the two-point conversion  and miss it.  I had that, too.  I had that, too, at the pool at my house. 
[02:38:30]  All right, but how much would you have made, sir?  Five grand.  Holy fuck.  And the two comes in, by the way.  And it would have made it only six points, so it didn't matter.  It didn't even make it a touchdown.  Yeah, well, the reason they did that was then they would have tried to hold them to  a touchdown, which would have tied it if they missed the extra point.  Right, right, right.  So that's kind of why they did that.  Tessio was always smarter.  Of course they did it the right way at the time.  Yeah, I hear you.  All right, sorry about that.  You didn't win the five grand, but you get a free rose. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, hold on the line.  But I have no one to buy for.  Huh?  I might get my ex something, because I'm going to see her in LA.  Just to rub it in, it's nice.  Yeah.  You know what?  Here, I was thinking of you.  Why?  Why not?  I didn't hang up on the guy.  I did hear a dial tone there.  He's good, I think.  Didn't sound like a hold to me.  He's good.  He's good.  Whoops.  You want to give out some roses?  Sure.  Listen, it's up to you guys.  But I wanted to tell everybody, listen, don't be a schmuck and wait until the day before 
[02:39:30]  like everybody.  No.  And then you've got to pay for shipping.  Yeah.  Get the free shipping.  Get it now.  Look, you advertise with a lot of people.  How many fucking roses do you sell every year?  That's what I need to know.  A little over 100,000, depending on the age.  100,000?  100,000 of these?  Right.  Wow.  And we sell at least like 60 or 70 Doping Anthony listeners.  Nice.  No, we do very, very well.  You do over 100,000 roses?  Yeah, we do around 10,000 in the store and about 90,000 online and the 800 number, toll-free 
[02:40:00]  number.  How many people?  I've been doing it for a long time, you know?  How many people got working?  How many people got working the switchboard?  Because I saw the switchboard area, too, Ant.  Oh, yeah?  I like the tour.  I've got to be honest with you.  Yeah, sure.  He has this huge conference for him that he sets up with hot college babes and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the answer falls.  Somebody told me it's like a strip club that sells jewelry.  I said, all right, I guess that's a compliment.  There's some class there.  You want people to know you've got some class and you take your business very seriously.  It's a fun operation.  You know, we just want to have fun.  And we just, you know, if you're looking for somebody with white gloves and talks with 
[02:40:30]  an English accent, you're going to the wrong place.  I'm not going to get on that.  Let's go to North Carolina.  They're desperate down there.  Let's say hi to Sean.  Sean, we got Steven Singer on our show today from IHateStevenSinger.com.  What do you got, Sean?  Go.  Nah.  I was going to beg for a rose.  Don't give it to him.  Start begging, then.  I don't hear you begging.  I need a rose.  I need a rose.  It's my wife's birthday next Monday, but Valentine's Day, and I got nothing.  How old is the bitch? 
[02:41:00]  Does she have a nice set of twos?  Yeah, I know about.  I think I like Sean.  Go for it.  Why not?  A nice rose for Sean.  All right.  Hey, Steven Singer, we got some, like, I might get a rose for my mom, and she's older.  What color does the old broads like?  Well, the traditional red.  The red is always good, but they like the all-gold one, the traditional one, which is  nice for a mom.  But the blue, the green, peach, we have purple. 
[02:41:30]  I mean, we have every color.  So I'm no close.  I got 18 colors.  Whatever she doesn't have, get her that.  But I'm no closer to picking a rose.  I got to figure out between 18 colors.  Give me a color.  I wouldn't give my mom the red.  I would give that to your wife or to a sweetheart type of thing.  I would give her anything other than the red.  The red signifies more of a relationship.  What's your second favorite color?  Fogging.  Well, I'm into the green apple now because that's a new color this year.  It's the first time we ever had that.  Jets.  Green apple.  There you go. 
[02:42:00]  You have 18 colors?  Something like that, yeah.  Fuck.  I thought it was only four.  Collect them all.  Do you have one shitty color that just doesn't sell?  We have a rainbow rose that is a rainbow like the gay flag.  Ah, all right.  That's right, gay.  Perfect for standing up in an anus.  Yeah.  You don't put it in the old stink vase.  Right, right.  Hold this and with your broth in the other hand.  Hold this while you're walking your small dog in a robe.  That's very nice.  Let's go to Trucker Cletus. 
[02:42:30]  He sounds like you need some help.  Trucker, what do you got, buddy?  Love you.  Love the show.  All right there, Cletus.  What do you got?  You're in Indianapolis.  You're handsome devil.  I'm in Indiana delivering some steel.  Damn.  Nice.  Working man.  I'm poor.  You son of a bitch.  Millions of money.  Yeah, huh?  Do we have any listeners with money?  No.  Not.  A few, maybe.  Hmm. 
[02:43:00]  Yes, sir?  Mm-hmm.  I just want to know.  For who?  You can't just sit.  You got to impress the guys here.  Make us laugh or something.  Come on.  Tell us a horrible story.  What's your favorite thing about O&A?  Oh.  My favorite thing?  Yes.  Is when Opie likes to hang up on people, but.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh.  Oops.  Oh, see that.  That was his wish.  Well, he got his favorite thing. 
[02:43:30]  That's way better than a rose.  There you go.  Oops.  No, I like these roses.  How about Illinois, Stephen?  You like Illinois?  Sure.  All right.  Jeff in Illinois.  Hey, Jeff.  How's it going?  Hey.  You want a rose?  Yes.  Who are you going to give it to?  My wife.  What are you going to write on the card?  Oh.  Uh, thanks for sticking around.  You're a real romantic.  Thanks for sticking around through my pedophilia trial. 
[02:44:00]  Thanks for sticking around.  That is great.  What a dear.  Yeah.  You got yourself a rose.  That's classic.  Why the thanks for sticking around?  Anything to that besides the obvious?  Yeah, the obvious.  I'm going to ask most of the time.  Yeah.  Kids?  You got the kids?  Yeah.  Hmm.  That's why you're sticking around.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I guess you'll get a rose. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, that was pretty impressive right there.  That's three.  We've got to do nine more of these?  Listen, you could do none.  You could do them during the week.  You can do whatever you want.  Oh, we could do them during the week, too.  We could spread it out.  It's very nice.  I think we ought to give away one more, though, at least.  Hey, is your place haunted down there?  I tweeted a picture of that picture in your office.  Yeah, we have a ghost.  Really?  We have the ghost of Stephen Singer Jewel Wars.  I gave him the inside scoop, man.  He saw the thing.  Picture from 1931 with a ghost.  With a ghost?  Outside the building.  What do you think that shit's about?  Jack Torrance?  I don't know. 
[02:45:00]  That's a cool thing.  In a picture?  Yeah.  What do you think that shit's about?  They had long exposure, so that dummy was probably standing there and said, fuck, I can't stand here anymore.  I've got to take a piss.  I've got some avocado on me.  Right.  Something happened.  Or is it really a ghost?  I don't think it's really a ghost, but it looks like a ghost.  It looks cool in the picture.  That's a good story.  Yeah, it is.  This is a very old picture, obviously, of the building that is now I Hate Stephen Singer's place, right?  Yep.  What used to be there?  It was, Jewelers Row was, like I said, the first shopping industry. 
[02:45:30]  It was always jewelry stores, but there was a lot of antique stores, there was a couple eyeglass stores, there was some haberdasheries, other retail were there.  Not that that's too exciting.  But anyway, there was a picture of the building.  We had it blown up, and then when you blow up, you can see the exposure of a guy dressed in period garb with, like, a Jeff cap and things like that, and it looks like a ghost that he's there.  Period garb was wearing a Kotex?  Yeah.  See, that's all he's wearing.  Chip liked that one.  Yeah.  I was going to say, what's he got a tampon on? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, see?  Oh, he just, he just forearmed Stephen Singer.  Chip is laughing very heartily.  Why would ghosts wear clothes to begin with, and why would they wear clothes of the time?  So you don't see that cocks and cunts?  How do the clothes become ghosts?  I don't know.  Like, how do the clothes become a fucking ghost?  That's the dumbest thing when ghosts are dressed a certain way.  Why can the clothes just be there?  The clothes are just clothes, and the ghost is a ghost.  What are they, ghost clothes?  Why don't they talk about this shit on all those ghost shows? 
[02:46:30]  I know.  You're right.  I don't buy it for a second.  You're saying ghosts should be naked?  No.  Yeah.  But the clothes shouldn't be ghostly.  The clothes shouldn't be ghosts.  Right.  Either the clothes are still clothes floating around on a ghost, or the guy's naked.  Bravo.  Ghost clothes.  I know the answer to that.  We just proved there's no ghosts.  What?  Because the ghost image will be of the last image of the person, and so if they had certain  clothing on, that's the image that's captured and becomes...  So it's not really clothing, it's part of the ghost? 
[02:47:00]  It's a part of the ghost image, the image that was, the imprint that was left on us.  They could just make fucking hats and socks and shoes out of their own ghostly self?  Yes, you can.  Go to ghosthats.com.  Go to IHateGhostHats.  Ghost Hats.  Ghosts are always leaving their hats.  Forget the douchebags.  I got one more question for my tour.  Go ahead.  But it wasn't about...  You really paid attention.  Well, as I was driving to your place...  You have a corner of Aeth and Walnut in Philly. 
[02:47:30]  Exactly.  Awesome area, by the way, to walk around.  It is cool.  And is there like the first bank or something down there that I saw?  The first bank is across the street.  The first hospital in the United States.  Is that the one Ben Franklin opened up?  Oh, yeah.  They can see his awful fucking ex-house.  Yeah.  Ben, remember Brent Franklin's house where they just showed the layout?  Here's where the kitchen was.  No, Tim Savion showed us.  Yeah, that's terrible.  With his ass wedge and his horrible loafers.  Yeah.  He had an ass wedge that day.  Me and Jimmy kept pointing at him.  He would get really mad at us. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  I like the hole in the ground, though, that's got the glass over it.  And you can look down into Franklin's shitter.  Yeah.  Literally, his shitter.  Yeah.  Which is like a dirt room with a hole in the floor.  They bring you to an empty lot.  What a fucking ripoff.  Ben must have taken some nasty dumps.  But the bank isn't across the street from you, is it?  Isn't it down the street?  The first bank is down the street.  The first hospital is across the street, Pennsylvania Hospital.  The Walnut Street Theater is...  But I want to talk about the bank.  That building looks amazing.  What's inside there now?  That's from 1816.  It's a restaurant now.  It's a restaurant.  You've got to see this thing. 
[02:48:30]  It was from Philadelphia Savings Fund Society.  Is that haunted, too?  No.  I bet every place is haunted, because it's just too old not to be.  If some place is really old, something horrible had to happen in it.  Yeah.  All right.  That is cool.  It's a cool area to look at.  Let me go to Bobby in Wyoming, who's collecting your roses, sir.  Nice.  Bobby.  Hello, O.N.A.  Welcome aboard, Bobby.  What's up, Bobby? 
[02:49:00]  Stephen, I've been collecting the roses for my wife.  I have a red...  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go...  What were you saying?  Of course you don't care.  No.  I don't know what happened.  Could you start over?  Stephen really wants to hear this.  He wants to put it on his website.  Go ahead.  Okay.  I've heard that before.  I enjoy your roses, Stephen.  You got all the colors, really?  No.  Just the gold, the green apple, got it this year.  Oh, nice. 
[02:49:30]  Nice.  Which ones are you missing that you want?  I want the sapphire blue one.  Oh, well, who would?  Why didn't you order it, then?  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Does your boyfriend enjoy the roses?  Yeah.  You want the rainbow one?  Sounds like you might want the rainbow one.  With a vibrating stem?  That one might be fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So why didn't you order the blue one?  Because I just ordered the green apple one this year. 
[02:50:00]  So you couldn't order two?  You could order a blue and a green apple one.  I should have.  Yes, you're right.  They run out quick.  Yeah.  You're not getting a blue one.  Forget it.  You want a peach?  Give me thanks.  No, no disrespect, but I want a blue one.  You're getting a fucking peach one.  We have mauve and melba.  Pick them.  Melba.  I'm taking a blue one.  They're hard to get.  Melba.  That's a big sour.  Yeah.  Melba.  What if we start making roses?  Is there a lawsuit?  Would that be a lawsuit down the road? 
[02:50:30]  Go for it.  I just spray paint mine.  You can do that after your radio career.  Yeah, please.  O&A roses.  All right.  You have to bring that up again.  Bobby, hold our line.  We're going to give you something, all right?  Yes.  Hook them up.  I just want to ask Jimmy, with the green apple in front of you, does that bring anything to  mine, the color green?  I don't know.  I'm just wondering.  I said before.  Oh, you did?  It's really nice.  Yeah.  It's green with envy.  Oh, he's pushing Steven with his forearm smash. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Yeah.  Well, could you give out the free stuff for us so we can get out of here?  Sure.  Oh, look.  There's free stuff.  This is Plagola at its finest.  Let's go.  We brought everybody.  Let's go.  Listen, we brought everybody roses for your collection.  We brought new colors for you guys so you can add on to the collection for your ex-girlfriend.  Leah, why aren't you talking?  She's nice.  She's really worried.  I was actually going to ask her out.  She was nervous.  She didn't have to be.  She's been staring at her phone the entire time like, please don't notice me.  How's the fiance?  Yes, she said, let me get my fake engagement ring on. 
[02:51:30]  No, I wasn't going to ask her.  So what about your fiance?  What does he do?  He owns a web development company.  Oh, boy.  A lot of money, right?  Yeah, he does.  Okay.  Does he make websites?  He does.  Okay, good.  Did he get the ring from Steven Singer?  He did.  Oh.  So she knows how much it costs.  She probably picked it out.  No, you know, it was a pain in the ass.  I had to write everything out there, fake names, and do all this covert thing so she wouldn't  find out.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and then every time she was talking to me, I was nervous I was going to screw it up, you  know, and I had to kick her out of my office and stuff.  It was a real, yeah.  Did you make the guy pay? 
[02:52:00]  Did I make him pay?  Sure.  No, I mean pay.  Oh, no.  Is he one of these overly good?  Very nice guy.  Is he an overly good-looking guy?  He's a very nice guy.  He's handsome.  So he's not that good-looking, but he was smart enough to marry a girl who works in a  jewelry store knowing he could go to the bar.  Strategically, that was brilliant.  That is pretty smart.  Listen, she's way too good-looking for him, let's put it up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's the short end of the stick?  Right.  Right.  When are you getting married?  We're thinking New Year's Eve.  Really?  Quick.  Wow.  New Year's Eve. 
[02:52:30]  That's less than a year.  Oh, boy.  The compound available?  Yes, always available.  Nobody's going to want to go to the wedding.  Don't still mind the drunks.  Yeah, New Year's Eve.  It's going to be a big party.  We were just bitching about these type of weddings.  God, this is embarrassing.  Listen, this is why she's doing it.  This way you get the gifts and nobody shows up.  I think it was a genius move.  Ah.  Right?  Get married in Philly?  Philly proper?  No, I think we're going to do the shore.  Really?  Jersey shore.  A little party action.  Nice.  Glass it up.  Yeah.  Just a big party.  You know what?  Big party.  So that's like the big thing.  When I think really cold winters, I think Jersey shore. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  So I think it's perfect for a wedding.  Well, in case anybody was going to come, you know, you have it at some obscure place where  you're not going to do it.  Yeah.  With a blizzard going on.  Yeah.  We're going to see a dream sequence in The Sopranos.  Holy fuck.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  She said, you have plans for New Year's?  I said, yeah.  Oh, good.  You know, we're having a wedding then.  I say guarantee knowing shows by having it outdoors.  Might as well go all in.  I was going to be on the beach, for sure.  We're having it at Bananas when I'm there on a Friday.  It's a Jamaican wedding right on the beach. 
[02:53:30]  We're very happy for Leanne.  We've seen her for years.  So she's a very nice girl.  Very nice.  She is.  She's the best.  So why are you hanging with Steven Singer?  Yes.  Where's our gifts?  On any level.  Yeah.  Give us our fucking gifts.  Let's go.  We want gifts.  Right now.  Oh.  Hook them up.  Here comes one.  All the roses have to go back in the box.  Oh.  Oh.  Now we got their used roses now, Steven.  You can't put them back in the boxes.  Thank you.  In your very fancy green room slash office slash crap hole, we have brought many, many different 
[02:54:00]  types of roses for your enjoyment.  Oh.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh.  And any color or flavor that you want.  Even some colors that we don't even have on the website.  Oh.  Some really special stuff.  Real collector.  Where are those?  Just for you.  Yeah.  We got them on the secret.  I'm not allowed to say them because I'll get in trouble.  From who?  Because Leanne will yell at me because then people call up and say they want some color.  And they want that color that doesn't exist.  So they're the experimental colors you're not sure if they're going to work yet?  No.  No.  Yeah.  We just.  Exactly.  It's every year we try to add another color. 
[02:54:30]  Period.  Blood red.  Yeah.  Well.  We call this one cyst yellow.  Right.  Oh.  That is.  Oh.  Look at that.  Wow.  The yellow one does look nice.  Very nice.  See that?  That's very nice.  Sunshine.  Sunshine.  You make up the names yourself?  I certainly do.  Sunshine.  It's a whole lot of bullshit.  Why are you smelling it, Jimmy?  I want to see if it smells like sunshine.  Can I do the green apple for my mama?  I don't see why not.  I'm going to give my mom a red one with a photo of my cock. 
[02:55:00]  Did I say that?  I'm sorry.  I'm going to kill a hooker and provocatively pose her with it.  I love when they're provocatively posed and the police can't even tell you what they  did.  Yeah, exactly.  It just leaves it to the imagination.  Well, it's just like an Egyptian fucking painting.  Hieroglyphic.  Yeah.  Maybe she fell.  He posed like a Chinese elf.  I hear my rose sails dropping as we're talking here.  They're plummeting.  These are beautiful products.  People love it.  Free shipping.  And you can put your own personalized message of love.  You know what? 
[02:55:30]  A lot of people call me up and say, what the hell is he talking about?  Yeah.  What does that mean?  I say you put it on the computer.  You can type in your own message.  Or we can pick a message that looks like you wrote it, like you're a genius.  Yeah.  Or you can tell the operator, and they're going to put it in the thing.  You're going to have your own card.  A Valentine's Day card's right in there for you.  Yeah.  Makes it easy.  Honey, I'm so sorry.  Here's a rose the same color as the Valtrix you need to take now.  Well, they're actually not a...  Yeah, I have Valium Blue. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  No, people love them.  That's what we're going to make, new colors.  Valium Blue.  That's good.  What's the other one called Cialis?  Valtrix Purple.  Yes, Cialis.  Blue.  Oh, all right.  Cialis Blue.  Yeah.  I love how we had to make believe we didn't know the color.  Yeah.  Your acting's good.  Yes.  Oh, no.  Viagra's Blue.  Cialis.  I don't know what color Cialis is.  There you go.  That's what I was asking you.  Is it orange?  I don't know.  No, it's probably clear.  Oh.  Yellow.  Someone says yellow.  Oh, okay.  Why don't we do this?  I hate stephensinger.com to see the roses for yourself.  I don't think the pictures do them justice, by the way. 
[02:56:30]  No, the pictures never do them justice, and the pictures even look good.  They look good.  You know what's funny?  Most websites, they really airbrush the hell out of it, and the pictures look great.  When you get it, it looks worse.  Ours is the reverse.  We don't have a cell.  Ours stuff actually looks much better in person.  No, I have to say that, because now I'm seeing the roses in person, and on the website,  they're absolutely beautiful in person.  Order it.  You get the, like Stephen said, free shipping.  The wonderful gold box for the great presentation.  And what is this now, the story of the rose as a symbol of love? 
[02:57:00]  Give me one of those.  Oh, man.  My cracker sister.  Now that right there, she's going to read that and start weeping, right?  Girls, they love this.  Can you read it to everyone?  I could if I had my glasses.  You could read it.  Oh, my glasses.  No, I want Stephen to read it.  Please, Stephen.  Please.  It comes from the man himself.  Please.  I would be happy to if I could freaking see it.  I could do it.  He don't have his glasses.  Oh, Chip, you want to read the rose?  I'm old and I can't see it.  You want me to read it for you?  Yes, please.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Roses have long since been the symbol of love and beauty. 
[02:57:30]  It has been immortalized in the art and literature of many cultures.  Literature.  It is to the flower world what gold, how long is this, what gold has come to be in the realm  of precious metals.  These two timeless elements have been perfectly combined in your real rose flower, which is  carefully selected, preserved, and dipped in 24 gold.  No, it's 24 carat.  Oh, 24 carat.

It is hand-selected in size for quality and shape.  Then it is electroformed at the peak of its beauty.  Finally, it is finished in 24 carat gold for your lifetime enjoyment.  And they do last.  And that was a real text from my ex.  It's the one keepsake she was taking.  Yeah.  It was the rose I gave her before I destroyed our relationship. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  My horrible sexual issue.  Listen, it's a great thing.  Yes.  Because where else for 69 bucks, where else can you get a gift to get credit for all  year round?  Right.

And she's going to love it every year.  Right. 
[02:59:00]  Very good.  Don't even have to worry about it.  All right.  Why don't we get you the hell out of here?  Well, listen, guys.  Before we lose our entire audience.  Thank you so much for having me in.  I really appreciate it.  I appreciate you selling and hawking these roses.  Thank God you bring Leanne every time or we wouldn't let you in here.  I think it was last year or the year before she was too busy.  Something happened.  And you told me, don't ever effing come if you don't bring her.  So I made sure that I bring some eye candy.  Get back on that New Jersey turnpike.  You got to get back and sell some damn roses.  That's right. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  I think we're done for the day.  Yeah.  And I'll plug a couple of gigs.  Caroline's coming up.  If I don't cancel it, March 29th through April 1st.  Why would you cancel?  Because I'm just tired of being a zero with 30 people in the room.  And Saturday, February, Thursday through Saturday, the 16th through 18th, I'll be in the Atlanta punchline.  Damn, Atlanta.  Atlanta.  Hot Atlanta.  All right.  Atlanta.  I think, should we give more roses away now or what?  I say we give a couple more away.  Yeah.  The phones are lit more than they have been in two weeks. 
[03:00:00]  How about we take two more random callers for today and give out more roses?  Line one and line two.  Really?  That's it.  Really?  Yeah.  You gave one to Tony who says, I want free roses.  I'm an old fuck married to a young girl.  I like that.  Oh, that's all right.  So Tony gets one and Blake.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you, Steven Singer.  Thanks for having me in, guys.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM. </pre>
