<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between serious and highly inappropriate discussions.  It began with a somber yet darkly humorous discussion about the recent plane crash in Clarence Center, New York, resulting in 49 deaths.  Opie, Anthony, and guest Jimmy Norton speculated on the pilot's experience, referencing Captain Sully Sullenberger, and discussed the type of plane involved,  potential causes like icing and pilot fatigue,  and even played air traffic control audio from the moments before the crash.

The mood quickly shifted to lighter fare as Opie showcased photos of his new car and old pictures from their early radio career, one of which depicted Anthony's former house, described by listeners as resembling the Amityville Horror house. This led to a discussion about music, focusing on the Ting Tings and Tool, their musical styles, and lead singers.  They also touched upon 80s dance styles, referencing a scene from *The Terminator*.  Listeners called in; one discussed M.I.A.'s "Paper Planes," and another, "Kellen," engaged in a humorous, somewhat antagonistic exchange with the hosts about their perceived effeminacy. The discussion then veered towards Australian women and stereotypes about them.  The show interspersed these conversations with giveaways, including tickets to a Dennis Leary show.  They returned to the plane crash, discussing the challenges of flying similar planes so soon after the tragedy, before ending the segment with a shocking anecdote about the identification of a victim dragged for 20 miles by a van, using their iPhone.  Jamie Foxworth was featured in a "Black History Month" segment.


The next segment started with a discussion about a suggestive photograph and its subject's gender, before rapidly transitioning to a listener's story of a home invasion where he shot at four armed intruders, hitting their car.  The hosts debated the legality and ethics of his actions, promising security camera footage on onaradio.com.  A caller, Ronnie, then vehemently criticized the hosts' earlier jokes about the plane crash, sparking a heated debate about the appropriateness of humor regarding real-life tragedies.  Ronnie's arguments were met with pushback from the hosts, who defended their commentary as satire and questioned Ronnie's own sensitivities given his consumption of other media depicting violence and death.  The conversation became increasingly confrontational, culminating in the hosts mocking Ronnie's profession. The segment concluded with the "FU Line," featuring angry listener calls, promotion of a U2 tribute band, and rambling tangents, including a discussion about Joshua Tree National Park.


The third segment centered around a listener's terrifying van ride on Cape Cod, packed into a vehicle with pot smokers, driving at high speeds with locked doors and no seats. This led to a broader discussion about the vastness of nature (specifically the Mojave Desert and the Grand Canyon) and the insignificance of human life in comparison.  The discussion then veered towards an intense internal conflict between Opie and Anthony's interns.  David’s alleged sexism in assigning tasks to female intern Jill resulted in her promotion to "Executive Intern" and David's demotion.  This added to the already existing feud between David and Sam, which escalated after Sam sprayed David with Liquid Ass. Accusations of racism, sexism, and incompetence flew. The segment ended with David showcasing the now-broken bottle of Liquid Ass and offering listeners a sniff. This was immediately followed by the arrival of Penthouse Pet of the Year, Teia Parker, and Shauna Lanae, oblivious to the pungent smell, with Opie apologizing to Teia for previous unprofessional behavior.


The next segment featured a studio interview with Taya, a Penthouse Pet of the Year runner-up. The conversation began with a clarification regarding a "drinking out of the puss" incident that Taya vehemently denied.  The discussion quickly turned sexually explicit, with numerous comments about penis size, celebrity genitalia, and Taya's own experiences.  Taya detailed her career in adult films, starting at 18 years and 5 days old, discussing her breast augmentation and preferences for larger men. She also recounted a self-defense incident involving pepper spraying a would-be carjacker.  The hosts’ sexually suggestive comments, the suggestion of a "game of chicken" involving nudity, and encouragement for her to press her breasts against the studio window escalated the situation until Taya, visibly upset, broke down in tears and left, expressing her intention never to return to radio. The hosts attempted apologies, and the conversation concluded with discussion of Taya's behavior and Lainey's role in booking her.


The final segment included a studio interview with Taya Parker, this time from "Rock of Love Bus."  The hosts engaged in humorous, often crude, anecdotes and inside jokes about her time on the show, referencing alcohol, a dog, oven mitts, and other unspecified events.  There was significant teasing and ribbing from the hosts, and attempts to get more details from Steve, a staff member.  The conversation included references to other individuals from the show, including Shauna Linnea, and disparaging remarks about other contestants.  Parker participated in the banter, occasionally defending herself.  She promoted her website and appearance at the "Romantic Depot" in Paramus, New Jersey, and the segment ended with further joking and concluding remarks from the hosts.

[00:01:30]  has a way of kicking you in the teeth and and keeping it real keeping it real uh the uh the fun  stories the happy stories they um they don't last forever do they do  i went to bed early so i didn't i didn't know about this i i come walking in and everyone's like  uh uh hopefully no one was on that plane because you know i spent a lot of time up in western new york 
[00:02:00]  three years in buffalo yeah plane goes down what in clarence clarence center hit a house what's your  clearance clarence at a house 49 dead there's gonna be no sully this time around no and i was  telling anthony in the office you think the pilot you know as soon as he knew there was something  wrong with the plane was like ah i'm gonna be the next sully and he's probably dreaming of his  interview with larry king and like here today show and good morning america trying to bring it in  i'm gonna be the guy oh my god i'm the new sully all right all right here we go all right here we 
[00:02:30]  go what do i do first ladies and gentlemen brace for impact um what do i do let's see should i do  leno or letterman first larry king's an idiot um i won't do him yeah oh boy we sure are going in fast  though there's no water damn it maybe i could bounce off a couple of these roofs and land in a tree  terrible tragedy uh yeah honestly first commercial uh airline deadly crash in the u.s in two years so 
[00:03:00]  he wanted to be the new sully then on the way down he realized he was but they're going from godsmack  oh and he can't fly either no no but uh yeah that's weird that's the first that's the first one with  casualties because there's a reality there's been a bunch of incidents uh in the last year hasn't  there a couple running off the runways yes landing in the the river and uh and what what not well this  is technically not even continental i mean it is because but they use continentals uh but they don't 
[00:03:30]  i don't believe they have the same maintenance cruises continental that's why i hate these smaller  flights um like do they have the umbrella jets the 51 seaters and i don't know what kind of plane  this one had uh 74 let's call it did yeah yeah for real yeah 40 49 died 48 in the plane one on the  ground and you know it wasn't a full flight obviously they had an extra 20 or so seats oh okay  but uh it's so weird you're saying that jimmy because literally monday kenny was saying that you 
[00:04:00]  refused to fly those type of planes and i kind of i slightly rolled my eyes like come on what could you  know i i i used to fly these planes all the time when i was living in western new york because a lot of times  you don't have a choice right you know they they give you one of these prop plane what are you gonna  do you don't know well especially me i i didn't know you know next thing you know you're walking  up to the prop plane and getting on yeah it's a quick ride to buffalo i've i've probably done that  exact flight 10 times over the years this was a prop yeah that's they introduced those that's what i'm 
[00:04:30]  saying so okay with you telling kenny just recently that you wouldn't fly those i'm like come on i've  flown them all the time never had one issue and here it is literally three or four days later this  thing goes down yeah it's it's like they they they seem to add them like i don't remember continental  having them i remember them having the embrayers the 51 seaters were jets so i would fly them and then  the pittsburgh route i noticed started having these uh these prop planes i'm like well you got to get  us one that's a jet i'm not flying the prop but again it could have been a i mean even the smaller 
[00:05:00]  ones where i think it's only three seats across which is weird there's one seat on one side and  then two on the other i'm like how is that does that work yeah weight wise right you would think  it'd go two and two or one and one but one and two that that type i've never been on that's one of  those really kind of long ones yeah i've been on the shorter version of those the umbrella like uh  jimmy said but um yeah it looks uh in my professional unprofessional opinion yeah but you know 
[00:05:30]  a lot about flight looks like icing you're going with icing yeah it was kind of cold windy um  and uh just when a plane loses lift like that move comes right in they said that kind of weather  around buffalo they said just dropped out of the sky man and they said a couple of other pilots in  the area had reported ice building up on their wings right um so you get a um a situation like that  especially i i heard a gentleman speaking saying that uh that plane was delayed at newark for a 
[00:06:00]  while and you get the flight crew they you know they're human they get a little tired uh start using  that autopilot uh for the flight and then if ice builds up uh the autopilot will try to compensate for  it and it'll keep compensating until it kicks off and when it kicks off it throws it back into the  pilot's hands very unstable you uh the autopilot can actually handle it to a point but it starts 
[00:06:30]  putting the airplane in a very precarious um pitch where it's trying to keep the plane flying  by giving it more power and putting the nose up higher and higher to try to give it lift but in  the meantime it's slowing down it's losing lift because of the ice on the wings and the angle  of attack they call it how how high up the nose is right and uh you know if it kicks back to the  pilot at that point the pilot's like what the you know what am i i'm trying to control this thing now 
[00:07:00]  and and you know you get a wing over or the nose will just dip and uh it's over johnny  kablooey as i like using technical jargon colgan air by the way that's who operated this flight colgan air  with the colgan exactly with the continental logo though on the side yeah they they uh our partners  yeah our partner airlines yes yes we're in partnership with many airlines like colgan because  we're not dumb we're not we're not gonna fly what is this colgan air who's flying colgan air nobody 
[00:07:30]  everybody when there's a big continental on the side you're a flying airline i think you and i did it  when we had a flight out atlanta oh where where where the check-in area is is pretty much an area  that they they just gave this airline wasn't that the uh the time they just painted those air um i  forgot those those value jet planes with the air tram logo oh yeah and i i was on the pay phone at the 
[00:08:00]  time because i don't think we had cell phones with bob going bob i'm not flying on this thing one of  these went down they just painted over the logos like we don't want to do this and he's like it but  it's it's their hub down you know that's all they fly that's it you gotta gotta go down you gotta get  on the plane thanks for uh talking me into impossibly dying bob i appreciate it we must go on  so 49 dead wow god what's going on with flying well it's still you know there's 
[00:08:30]  safest uh form of transportation we're all feeling good about that but everyone is thinking about it  now yeah everybody yeah i mean we're heading toward a vacation i'm i'm starting to think all right where  can i drive to and don't call up with hello you have a you have a better chance of dying if you drive  to the airport you know that yeah but it doesn't make you feel good when you're in the air it's all  about how what makes you feel good at least in a car it's like oh my god you're gone 
[00:09:00]  in a plane it's just like all right what's our altitude how much longer do i have before i perish  yeah i really get a chance to think about this you know some of these plane crashes you scream  to the point where you lose your voice and you get tired of screaming yes and then everyone's just  in there looking at each other like all right like homer yeah exactly exactly exactly uh chick 
[00:09:30]  pilot are we talking chick pilot uh-oh fly hey mcfly how are you uh pretty good hey my boys uh happy  birthday jimmy all that good stuff yeah it was a chick was a pilot now i'm not saying that means  anything i'm sure a woman just as good as a man but um you know what i like i like uh combat  pilots flying your plane you like sully i like guys that have flown in fighter jets sully uh he was 
[00:10:00]  uh you know f4 phantom guy uh not many women come from a background of flying actual fighter aircraft  because you know not really allowed in combat we're just allowed them they have them they have  women pilots not a lot of them right but uh they don't fly in combat really and you know usually  support missions things like that but i kind of like a guy that could land a plane after it's been  shot at that's that to me is the ultimate or or land in a river after the geese take out you think 
[00:10:30]  sully's gonna be all all over the news is the expert oh so they're clamoring to get sully oh if we can  only get sully sully how is this exactly like your accident only different with debts and icing  and um no water houses unbelievable uh we got some air traffic control audio  is that the trick pile 34 7 approach call the 34 0 7 buffalo delta 1998 uh look out for the right 
[00:11:00]  side about five miles uh for dash eight should be 2300 do you see anything there uh negative  98 we're just in the bottom there's nothing on the t-casts hold on 34 0 7 buffalo over 34 0 7 buffalo 
[00:11:30]  tower how do you hear i'm having some ground communication you need to talk to somebody  at least five miles northeast okay possibly clarence that area right in there akron area  uh either state police or sheriff's department you need to find out if anything is on the ground  this aircraft was five miles out and all of a sudden we have no response that aircraft  all i can tell you is the aircraft over the marker and we're not talking to him now  holy like just like that yeah that was it that thing must have went down fast it probably wasn't 
[00:12:00]  that high in the uh in the air anymore if it was only five miles out huh 1500  oh that's no oh you cannot recover from anything at 1500 and uh they're showing newark airport with  the same planes all grounded it looks like well they probably wouldn't be leaving at this hour  anyways maybe some of them would be uh those i don't trust those planes i mean maybe they're  well maintained no i want yeah there's a there's one of the wings just sticking out of the ground 
[00:12:30]  the tail is just popping out of the uh oh my god all right and then we got this a witness i knew  something was up and i thought to myself what if that plane crashes and right when i thought that i  heard a huge explosion over there and uh in my periphery i saw like a riff uh out the window i saw  the orange the orange flash and i i knew a plane crash well that way to go you just knew huh 
[00:13:00]  you knew all right good for you because i don't think i would have known that there was a plane crash  surely hayman lives at the corner of long and maple she was doing a puzzle she heard the noise and then  she came to her window and couldn't believe what she saw i heard this awful noise i went over to  the kitchen window and i seen this noise and this light coming down and all of a sudden it went bang  and fire and i yelled to my husband i said get out of bed i said the plane must have landed hayman 
[00:13:30]  originally thought the plane crashed in her yard and the magnitude of this crash didn't hit her until  much later and i thought maybe it was a little small plane and uh then they tell me it's a big  one now i don't think i want my daughter to come back from florida ever ever just leave her there she  probably doesn't want to see you anyway wow there you go just some of the audio we got so far that's  pretty uh meh god that's creeping well we get kicked in the teeth today man you know had a good 
[00:14:00]  had a good uh streak going there had a couple of uh planes that that had emergency landings and  everybody walked out hunky dory making it exciting for everybody and you get heroes and you know  yeah you get this overall good feeling and now everyone dead just like it's supposed to be  usually right god that's terrible well godspeed everybody that's the big story today we got

[00:23:00]  interest some of the fans but uh i took a picture of anthony's old house my old house the one in  huntington that uh when me and me and open carpooling yep into work together uh i would be dropped off  there yep or i would drop op off and then drive there and that's where me and the ex-wife lived and a lot  of people are commenting that it does look like the amityville horror house which uh it also did on  the inside yeah which uh they're saying wow it's a mini version of the amityville horror house 
[00:23:30]  yeah i was gonna editorialize my you know the the picture and i was like i'll leave it to anthony  but then everyone's everyone uh because they've been listening to the show for a long time they're  like oh were those the windows where the candles were lit uh for romance night yep that door the front  door was open the curtains are open downstairs and the candles are all lit and all i wanted to do is  play half-life and uh how does it make you feel to see that uh you know that's a little nostalgic 
[00:24:00]  that's it okay that's the house aunt lived in uh huntington that's also the house i was in when i  broke up with her so right so there's a happy moment  it runs the gamut yes but that was my little little house you know what's funny  that house could fit in your living room now yeah uh almost the time almost and depending on  uh how some companies uh do i might be right back in that house well what are you gonna do 
[00:24:30]  next uh trip to huntington i'll take a picture of the house i uh lived in but you know all right i  spread out my my twitter stuff the tree house the tree house right you had a wacky house in uh  honey and i only had half the house you had a whole house whole house you had a whole house well if you  remember there were tenants that lived in the basement apartment oh that's right that's right  they went around the left side of the house as you look at it right and there were people that lived  down there yeah and then uh i was going through some more boxes getting all my stuff out of my mom's 
[00:25:00]  house and i found two pictures you guys show jimmy this oh yeah two pictures of um uh the first time  and i worked together i believe or or pretty much the first week we started doing radio together  yeah and i put those up on my twitter account op radio on twitter but and i i point out to anthony  look at me always being the guy trying to promote and market the show we're in the middle of a bit  with a goat look at you and i'm trying to make it look natural that i'm holding a wbab sticker in the 
[00:25:30]  in the shot he's got a sticker in the shot just like because i knew that you know the trade magazines  not even the real papers like the radio trade magazines oh they would they would eat up this photo  and print it because there's a goat in a radio station that's crazy and anthony's trying to feed  the goat and i'm there like kind of like with my mouth wide open and i'm holding a bab sticker reacting  to what anthony's doing it's a perfect shot for the trades a perfect shot is that is that the picture  brother joe oh the other one yeah the black and white photo which was done in the mid 90s by the way i 
[00:26:00]  don't know why this is a black and white photo i must have had a disposable camera or something  but that it that was the first day these guys came in and uh did did uh what was my radio show  back then that was the first day you guys met yeah uh the first yeah i think so yeah show i show  won afro wars didn't i yeah anthony with a massive afro any yes i just didn't realize how long travis  i've been working with you guys uh it kind of looks like travis it looks like carlin in the 70s 
[00:26:30]  are uncertain but when he had that uh those goofy half smiles brother joe yeah true oh god damn that  was a long time ago so i i put those two pictures up on uh on the twitter account but people are  saying i got to bring them in and scan them because i i didn't get a great shot of it i mean you get  the idea obviously right yeah so i think it's uh very funny to look at i was digging through  boxes and i'm like you gotta be kidding you holding that sticker is so typical like radio 
[00:27:00]  always always thinking about the marketing angle always why not what are you gonna do  so join me on uh twitter op radio we have a good time i showed the inside of my car  uh yesterday on the way out to huntington with my satellite radio just like hanging  sideways like swinging that's not curiously that's that was the inside of my my car  wait why is your why don't you have it installed they don't do it or it was i install it in the uh 
[00:27:30]  the air vent for a while and then it just kind of you know that's that's the original unit  oh this is not your new truck no oh okay that's what i thought here's your satellite radio  idiot that's what i thought you meant no can you imagine they did a sloppy job that's shoddy  workmanship i know i i wrote inside old car yeah just so people aren't confused and then uh people  like commenting on a couple of the cds i had laying in there uh mute math and uh and management 
[00:28:00]  and uh getting uh all sorts of comments on my music choices some some good some bad yeah  some good some bad well that's what you're gonna get with music that's not the only two cds cds i  got my car and for the people that are wondering the other desk that you can barely see is the uh  latest uh cd from nick to paolo that was given to us oh so that's his comedy cd in there we got  that ting tings huh good ting tings in there you got the ting tings cd yesterday my friend i was  listening to that whole thing on the way uh home yeah i'm such a fag you like everything about him i 
[00:28:30]  there's probably maybe two songs on there that i was kind of like all right but the rest of them  were like wow these are catchy goddamn songs well they had that other hit too what was the other hit  yeah not as big as uh no it did pretty well yeah well you're right huh  what was the other song by the resident uh expert on gay music no just i like good music  he's got a little rock oh you'll hear it on the swishy channel oh really they put it on the pop 
[00:29:00]  channel oh yeah they will and maynard's got a new band yeah um i heard uh i heard i'm not sure how  you pronounce it and if i pronounce it the wrong way i might get it so lucifer they put a p instead of  the l pusifer something like that yeah i think that's how it's pronounced maynard's a weird dude  though man but the but the song i heard yesterday it was really uh it got me first play i'm like  all right i think i gotta check out more of this uh any band i don't want to say the band lucifer with 
[00:29:30]  but uh replace the l with a p any band he's in it's gonna be yeah he's a fur that's just weird  possifer you like tool jimmy i do uh i don't love them but i i got into them recently because i've heard  uh a bunch of stuff over the years and uh i wouldn't say i'm a fan dude tool tools and that  other side pro i'm perfect yeah thank you perfect circle i do very much like the song uh know what's 
[00:30:00]  a great about know what's great about tool maynard like most like bands the lead singers front and  center i went and saw a tool show i'm like where's maynard he's in the back to the right singing from  there for the whole show i don't like uh stealing the spotlight for the entire show and it just made  you uncomfortable yeah because you're so used to having the guy out front it almost wouldn't be so  bad except the rest of their band really doesn't have a lot of stage presence right and he's the  only one that's kind of going nuts and doing things but he's all the way in the back yeah so 
[00:30:30]  you just get stuck with watching you know a couple of people you know like three people play music and  he's off in the back having a party somewhere dude it is so bizarre although there was a great show  that i went to was actually tickets that you gave me oh they were really good was it the same day  did we go the same show no you couldn't make it i think you were out to dinner but uh it was a  really small show in the little balcony no i was it was really nice tickets they're like front row  no these balcony tickets i got two were good okay yeah i was bummed i couldn't go with you that was  a great show i love to love everything this guy does certain great bands would have the lead singer  on the right hand side like from the audience stage right a lot of bands would put them in the center 
[00:31:00]  but a lot of uh a lot of other bands would have a bassist a lead guitarist and the singer all the way to the  right like who oh sabbath yeah sabbath did it that way he sure did but this was in the back but he  was he was no maynard i mean he if he could he would sing off stage at the concert i saw i'm sure he  changes it up as as they move on give anthony a song he's out of the conversation i i i just have to  hear he needs his tink tanks ah that's it right do you have a new favorite yet well she said no no i i'm 
[00:31:30]  kind of digging it though like there's only a couple of songs on the whole album that i'm just  like not really into isn't it like um it's like snotty english hot oh yeah  four little words  i don't know i don't know what this crazy liming is saying but my favorite line is coming up  come on aunt let's go okay ready 
[00:32:00]  she's very energetic live too oh i bet  how does anybody like this song what's happening with you people  do you listen to catchy stuff i certainly do but this one just doesn't get to you that's all  you don't like this  you certainly don't 
[00:32:30]  jimmy  if you heard this song all the way through five times you'd be hooked  it gets it gets in  you don't like this little liney  oh english bitch  hey mickey  hey mickey  hey mickey  kane was playing them way before they got there yeah yeah he introduced me to them he's a 
[00:33:00]  really yeah he was playing them before the itunes commercial he is the best rock jock  absolutely i've ever heard that's not my name that's not my name it's the same freaking song 
[00:33:30]  it's the same song it's tony basil obviously  who was an old broad when this song hit  oh i know  she tried to make believe she was a kid but she was floating around the music business for a very long time  remember that video with that pig cheerleader they had in it  yeah  you'd know she was the bottom of the pyramid  holding up the whole pyramid  just a mess  it's the same song though it  just twist it around a little bit  yeah a little you know  an 80s version  and look to all the people in shock 
[00:34:00]  you got your guilty pleasures too  shut up  shut your mouth  or at least brave enough to say  all right hey the ting tangs that song  kind of like it  nothing guilty about that  i know there's uh  not gonna make me look like the cool shark jock  but what the hell  you know it was uh  really really a great douchey moment  i was watching the terminator  the other day  the original  sure  and when she's in uh that club  right  and uh what was it called  some noir  club noir  tech noir  tech noir  right  when she's in tech noir 
[00:34:30]  uh sitting at that very inconvenient  you can't put anything on this table table  right  because it's just like a  great  and uh  when the terminator's walking his way through in slow motion  there are guys dancing  and it is so incredibly bad  they are doing the 80s  little 80s dance with their thin ties and everything  oh when they start getting shot  i'm just cheering  that would have been a perfect place for harvey milk  to do some of his uh recruiting i'm thinking 
[00:35:00]  recruit you  i'm here to recruit you  it's fantastic  there you go  uh anthony there's there's  start to look at that old picture that i uh put up  wow who was aunt's hair plugger back in the day  of that photo  that's  they did a great job  that's no plugs  they weren't even follicles  they were my own follicles from the top of my head  i you know i was burning the hair candle at both ends i guess 
[00:35:30]  and you know the candle that burns twice as bright  burns half as long  you had an impressive afro  we laugh at sam's afro  but yours was just as big when i met you  i would have won afro wars  hands down  right  here's the club noir scene  oh wow  she sits at the stupid table  sarah connor  and then the  the guy's dancing  in the background behind her is even awful  it is  every white guy dance  that's going on  it's fantastic 
[00:36:00]  he's walking in past the grave  looking for sarah connor  that was the governor of cal  that's so weird  yeah  and then he just breaks that guy's hand  the bouncer  he got all his weight lifting buddies  to play a little part here and there  yeah you know  gets his strong guys  he's walking through  tech noir  which is just a great 80s place  look at the girl behind sarah connor dance  there are some really awful dances  the dancing going on  and then the little slow-mo shot  of some of these guys  it's so bad  the little  there 
[00:36:30]  now we're going slow motion  look at that  dancing that's going down  woo  that says 80s  that is 80s written all over it  gay  gayties  wow  she's got the  aussie hair though  she really  that's a great  she should be shooting  shot in the dark video  shot in the dark hair  the ting-tings are from Denmark  Anthony  Denmark  what are they doing  with that limey accent  I guess they kind of  have that 
[00:37:00]  sound  I don't know  there's a girl  doing an 80s dance  and then there's one guy  that gets really  nice  yeah camera time  there he is  the thin tie guy  look at  you get to see him again  yeah  he's doing the 80s dance  he has a white suit jacket  and a white thin  like piano keys  thin tie  you just want that  white jacket  covered in his own blood  thank god  I grew up in the 90s  didn't have to deal  with that 80s crap  and then I was also laughing  at how outdated  his laser sight is  it's as long as the gun 
[00:37:30]  I look  look at his laser sight  do you have that gun  oh no  I got better guns than that  Schwarzenegger just stands  over Sarah Connor  and pulls the gun out  and just lasers her  right in the forehead  he is really ready  to give her a shooting  oh yeah  Michael Bain  knows how to  take care of him  if you're blessed  with a shotgun  that movie is always  fun to watch  every so often  yeah  the original Terminator  is a good movie  yeah the music  will drive you nuts  though  it's just a synthesizer 
[00:38:00]  going crazy  like someone just  put it on  autopilot  when they're running  everyone's screaming  audio  this is one of the  greatest scenes  in history  yeah it is a good one  let's say how to  Brian  shooting and bad  80s music  Brian in Pennsylvania  Brian  hey what's going on  fellas  hey man  I got an example  of a song  that's kind of stupid  but I love it  it's called  Paper Plains  I think it's M.I.A.  or Maya  I'm not sure  of course it's M.I.A. 
[00:38:30]  oh everyone  remembers Paper Plains  did she end up  performing that  at the Grammys  pregnant  yes  she was nine months  pregnant at the Grammys  she must have had  the kid by now  she still hasn't had  the kid  she shows up  at the Grammys  nine months pregnant  her due date  was pretty much  this past Sunday  during the Grammys  and she did the song  I didn't stay up for it  she started with the song  she did about  10 seconds of it  and then they did that  combo of Jay-Z  Kanye West  and a couple other rappers  whatever  yeah this song  Brian likes  I like this one too  Brian K.A.  oh really 
[00:39:00]  you gotta be careful  there's another freaking  you got the radio edit  I think I took the best  of the lyrics  I like this too  thank you  what was coming up there  Eric  it was getting close  to the F word  yeah  is that a new song  that's been out a while  no it came out  last year  but I mean  it's within the last couple  that's when it was  in Slumdog  it was also in Slumdog 
[00:39:30]  exactly  what's wrong with you  what's up with everyone  how do you not know that  what's going on  how did you not know that  he was having a good time  oh you're actually  a good one  what's up man  what did he say  he said how did you  not know that  that's a damn good point  I don't know  I apologize  Kellen is not happy  with you Anthony  what  Kellen  I'm sorry  Kellen go  we gotta hit a break here  but go  hey  dude you're a guy  yeah  your argument is shot 
[00:40:00]  right there  you're Kellen  and Helen  you got two girl names  and you're trying to say  stop calling us gay  Kellen  and Helen  you're Kellen  I was about to name  after Kellen Winslow  the football player  oh  well what  football like  European football  which we call soccer  no Winslow played  in there  oh I have no idea  Kellen and Helen  Kellen and Helen  I was just wondering  how you can call us gay  when we have got  the best sports fans  in the world  what do your sports fans 
[00:40:30]  do after they've gone  to see their matches  and their games  well  you know what Kellen  you're gonna argue  the soccer thing with us  yeah  yeah well we got guys  that go to any country  and kick the alley  at each other  alright  alright  Suze Mary  alright Kellen  you're not gay  let's just  alright  it's not a whole  let's cut our losses  yeah we're just  you know  having a little fun here  the guys are a little effeminate  that's all I'm saying  you never called your friends  growing up the F word  for gay  just cause you could  and apparently  they're from Denmark 
[00:41:00]  what do I know  yeah  it was  you know  it doesn't mean  you're actually  you know  I won't deny that  a lot of the gay guys  here are  over the top gay  absolutely  I used to work  with a lot of gay guys  and the filth  that would come out  of their mouth  was obscene  alright sir  I feel like I'm watching  The Office  the English version  of The Office  talking to this guy  fantastic  isn't it wonderful  he got it  yeah right  have you guys seen  a picture of the girl  from the Ting Ting  have you seen a picture  of her  yeah I wasn't sure  if she was hot or not  she's a little ridden hard 
[00:41:30]  and put up wet  but  I think cause  I think how they cut  the video  a lot of quick cuts  that means they're  trying to cover up  some  some stuff  yeah  that's what I think  if you check out  her picture of her  she's considered hot  in England  I know  people in America  people in England  are ugly  and have bad teeth  but she's like  the antithesis  of hotness  we got much hotter  girls here in America  my friend  yeah  much hotter  much hotter  you know what  seems to have 
[00:42:00]  girls that aren't  very attractive  a country  Australia  really  now I  I hear they're goers  I hear they're goers  but whenever I go to  these Australian  like websites  porn sites  you're going to  a regular Australian  website  and like Australian  amateurs  and things like that  I'm not saying  100%  but  a lot of them  just have this  weird  thing going on  I don't know  some of that 
[00:42:30]  inbredding they did  back when they  started  when they first  got over there  as the criminal nation  mix it up  I'm thinking  I've heard  there's really hot  I've heard  a lot of comedians  have gone over  there and worked  I've heard the girls  they were fantastic  I heard they're goers  like you can  absolutely  get laid  down under  but  you know  let's try to find  a hot Australian  babe today  I'm sure you'll  find one  but there's  something a little  like off about  them  yeah  just a little bit 
[00:43:00]  right  something off of  them  like Olivia Newton  John  I want to go  down to Australia  and then just do  nothing but  nothing but  hack like Australian  references  hey Australia  did you get a  bunch of shrimps  on the barbie  for me  oh they'd laugh  and love you  all the girls  would be clamoring  over you  oh yeah  just really corny  stuff  kangaroo jokes  we got a break  Stunt Brain  do this  going into break  or the people  just sat through  our music  break here

[00:44:30]  Anthony and I  were just discussing  this reminds us  that  like  back  god I guess  you gotta go back  almost 15-20 years  no one wanted  their music  in movies  no  so you would  always get this  weird obscure band  or  or Hollywood  would just get  some musicians  together and go  well we need  a rock song here  yeah  and now man  you know  you're praying that  your music gets  into movies  it was like 
[00:45:00]  such the no-no  for the longest time  they didn't understand  that  how that would be  good for their band  no  from a marketing  standpoint  this scene  where he's walking  through in slow  motion  even though the  dancing is horrible  yeah  it was just  it's a great movie  man  yeah  it was very ominous  Schwartz is the  best action hero ever  he was really good  in Terminator  yeah  they should just  take this song out  and put a newer  song in 
[00:45:30]  he's still got  Dummy  doing that dance  with his white jacket  and thin tie  that guy's the greatest  oh  the best  you still think  Australian  women suck  why who is that  Kylie Minogue  or something  no no no  that's a good one  right there  maybe we can put that  up on onaradio.com  there's no nudity  there stunt brain  I uh  look  he's a fresh face  I'm saying everybody  you go to some of  these amateur sites  and they show  Aussie girls  you know  that's like  Aussie model  yeah  you see just 
[00:46:00]  a regular  Australian girl  it's  well  Steve from  Jersey writes  Australian women  excuse me  have skin like  leather wallets  is that the problem  that could be a problem  they're out in the sun  a little too much  they're out in the sun  a lot  is that Kylie  Kylie Minogue  has the nicest hiney  that might be an older shot though  she's getting up there now  she's no kid  but she has a nice hiney  look at that hiney  she was doing the little  locomotion  song  yeah  do the locomotion  alright 
[00:46:30]  we're gonna move on  we're uh  Kim Wilde  with her big  big beefy lips  back in the 80's  remember her  where the kids in America  where the kids in America  whoa  I think she was English  yeah  we were talking about  the plane crash earlier  you wanna give me a power boot  on this computer  just like  what happened  smash it  what happened  just hit the off button  and then turn it back on  and I'll deal with it  cause everything's frozen  on my computer  it's very distracting  yeah  oh is that  is that my computer  no wonder  look at this thing 
[00:47:00]  holy mother  what is it  an Innova  Lenovo  what is this  what is it even called  this was  that's your  the Chinese IBM  computer  yeah but when did they  stop making those  no these are new  is that new  new  yeah well new  it's a little too big  looking to be new  that's  crap  yeah just hold that down  and uh  let's  let's restart  alright  alright  there you go  thank you sir 
[00:47:30]  god  I didn't even know  I thought that was  just sitting there  I thought that was  an old VCR  or something  that's what it looks like  an old friggin VCR  from my angle  it's definitely an old VCR  uh  anyway the big news  is the plane crash  you got me  what  the big uh  the big news  is that plane crash  49 dead  48  we're on the flight  one on the ground  ow  uh  do we have more info  coming in  the boys are working  in the office  when we get something new  we'll certainly bring it to you 
[00:48:00]  well there's one starting up right now  oh great  they're not grounded  they're taking off  oh that's wonderful  imagine you're on the same plane this morning  out of Newark  yeah  probably  safest flight around  uh  as long as you go into a different  maybe you're going somewhere  um  not the same make and model  that just went down in Buffalo  no same make and model  to Buffalo right now  I'd sit on the wing of that plane right now  there's no way  you're gonna have problems today  I don't think that's ever happened  that's the old lightning strike  and twice thing  I'm a big fan of flying  the day after a plane crash  knowing that the odds  are just ridiculous 
[00:48:30]  but to be on the same plane  that just crashed  that would make me a bit nervous  yeah  yeah why not  what if it's some kind of  some problem that they all have  that only happens  when it's going to Buffalo  yeah  well  and they wouldn't have it happen  two days in a row  like even DC 10s  who had a weird design flaw  uh  wouldn't  I do too  they're terrible looking  unstable looking planes  how about today's the day  it does happen  and then really freaks us all out  yeah  two in two days  imagine  so odd seeing that huge 
[00:49:00]  Continental logo  with the  wreckage around it  isn't it Jimmy  Continental has been  I still say  I'm still extremely comfortable  on Continental  because  they also had the one  that went off the runway  into the  they did  they had that  and then they had this  and they were also  the piece that fell off  when the Concord  was taken off  it was a piece of  Continental plane  that came off  and then the Concord  ripped up its  entire burst  I'll tell you where  Concords  where Continental  is really bad  apparently  driving around  on the taxiways  because they're  constantly clipping 
[00:49:30]  each other's wings  and hitting each other  like just a slow  little bump  by the terminal  look man  when you have to  squeeze through  two cars  that go down  some of these  side roads  here in New York  it's a little shaky  imagine being in a plane  and trying to figure out  if you've got enough room  that gets me though  when this is a little car  and he's driving  real slow  between two  like trucks  and I'm just  I'm whipping through  at 40  pulling my mirrors  in automatically  to just make it  that's why I'm so bummed  I got a new car  because you know  you got the crappy car  yeah you pull those mirrors 
[00:50:00]  in and you just go  you got the automatic  mirror thing  you're threading a needle  you got the automatic mirrors  where they  I'm not sure  I haven't read everything  so you don't got to lean over  and pull the mirror in  yeah I push the button  it goes  oh is that handy  it's wonderful  squeeze right through  sometimes I close my mirrors  while I'm driving  just to show the chicks  I can  you don't even need to know  what's behind or outside of you  I'm like who gives a turkey  ladies  get in  you know  from smoking advantage  hey the guy that got dragged 
[00:50:30]  for 20 miles  we got an update on that story  yes  man I was thinking about that  all day yesterday  what are the odds  that you're going to be dragged  for 20 miles  I think I heard the story by now  the guy gets hit  the guy that hit him stops  right  yeah  kind of pulls over  does the right thing  and as he kind of goes back  to see what's going on  with the guy  another car comes along  and  and  and  and somehow the guy gets  underneath the van  and is dragged for 20 miles 
[00:51:00]  yeah  and then the guy that  initially hit him  I think was thinking  well he must be okay  because I don't see him anymore  I don't see him  so he jumped back in his car  and went on his merry way  and it turns out  this other van  like dragged him  for 20 miles  smearing blood  all over the highways  in the tri-state area  oh  just a mess  and they've identified  this person right  they identified him  yes they did  that's going to be  what  nice little twist  to how they identified him  yes  because he had no  wallet on him  no ID  right  alright let's find out  yeah  police have finally 
[00:51:30]  identified the man  dragged under a van  for miles  across Queens  and Brooklyn  the victim's sister  and cousins  were in disbelief  over what happened  oh my god  everyone  could I ask a question  why is he talking  like that  because they're in disbelief  is that Pablo  that's uh  slattery  oh slattery  you're right  you're right  you're right  holy mackerel  slattery  oh my god  everyone 
[00:52:00]  everyone is crying  everybody is very crazy  especially over there  in my country  everybody is going crazy  oh my god  the man dragged  was 26 year old  Guido Carabajo Hara  who moved here  from Ecuador  oh wow  how does that work out  his last name is Hara  oh wow  and he dies in a hole  quite a horror  isn't it weird  when that crap works out  with these stories  last name is Hara  the man dragged 
[00:52:30]  was 26 year old  Guido Carabajo Hara  who moved here  from Ecuador  was working as a tile man  and sending money  home to his wife  and 4 year old daughter  police explained  that the man  was face up  when the second vehicle  ran over him  with his sternum  being fish hooked  by a steel plate  under the van  known as a skid plate  oh my god  it got his breast bone  but at least that tells you  that he probably died  if he wasn't dead  there's no way  you're living with 
[00:53:00]  your breast bone  hooked under a  hooked  you could get  you could live a little bit  why not  I don't know  that's  dude that's  your heart  it probably  it doesn't just slide  under neatly  I'm sure that  it rips up your  your innards  and your heart  if it's bad enough  to drag you  for 20 miles  it doesn't gingerly  slide in  yeah yeah  that was dragging him  over bumpy roads  and everything  he was pretty much  hooked on that thing  I'd say  what's the clearance  in a vehicle like that  it's your clearance  clearance  can you almost make it  you think  no  in that situation  you're gonna get  hooked every time 
[00:53:30]  oh no  I don't think  you'd make it  that's low clearance  low clearance  it's gonna hit you  you think you'd make it  all the way through  and that big fat  van differential  just takes your  friggin face off  how distracted  are you by your  reggaeton  the dragon guy  for 20 miles  wow  steel plate  under the van  known as  a skid plate  the body  was dragged  over highways  in queens  and brooklyn  nearly 20 miles  myself 
[00:54:00]  I said  how would that  happen  after the  50 minute trek  the body  was so battered  that clothing  and flesh  were worn off  from the friction  of the road  I saw  the body  I saw his face  and I cannot  believe it  I mean  until I saw  his face  I didn't believe  the victim  was killed  the day  after his  26th birthday  he will be  buried in  Ecuador  oh god damn  and in three  boroughs  apparently  yeah  wow  and uh

[00:58:00]  yeah nypd they're  like celebrities to  the out of towners  yeah so because  they're in a lot of  movies you know  yeah not the real  cops but a lot of  people play nypd on  tv so you want  pictures with them  they're all looking  for dennis friends  yeah  dennis friends  and his butt  remember when that  was a big  controversy  wow  they're gonna show  his ass in the  shower  lucky us  wow  lucky us  and side boob  they showed  some girl's side  boob 
[00:58:30]  yeah you know  they knew how  to get people  talking right  god i remember  all the controversies  that would pop up  years ago  uh the condom ad  that was a biggie  a bra ad where  they finally showed  the brassiere on  a woman  that was a huge  controversy for  television  really  yeah because they  used to just have  uh women  hold up a bra  or they would show  the bra as if it  was on an invisible  woman  and it's like 
[00:59:00]  spinning around  the playtex  bra lifts  and separates  that was uh  on tv  you know  and then finally  they had a woman  wearing a bra  they finally  filled it up  hey  look at my  great in this bra  and now you see  victoria secrets  uh models  in their panties  and bras  and it is  nothing  it is spank central  oh yeah  they just didn't  know how to make  the bra  they were like  black jackets  look at it  horrible 
[00:59:30]  you want your  boobs to look  like silos  they're just big  pointy nasty  things  god  yeah  look at that  who thought the  pointy breast was  attractive  hubba hubba  afraid of any  poke throughs  they made them  really thick  because they  didn't want  anything  showing through  maybe it was  chilly out  look at that  they were going  for that natural  that natural  cone look  and the 
[01:00:00]  natural cone  look  that could be  the most unnatural  thing ever  and the bra  went from like  their neck  to their belly  just this  hardcore material  18 clasps  in the back  look at that  pointy  who would wear  that  what is that  thing  it's like  how do you  explain that  a weapon  they're two  cones  it's like  but with the  point  the nose cone  of a rocket  it's like  two v2's  on her chest  looks like a  pyramid  if you tilt  your head  sideways 
[01:00:30]  and the torso  looks like mine  it's a very  average looking  physique  you know what  I didn't want  to know more  about that  picture  but I'm  suspicious  that it  might be  a guy  wearing that  bra  yeah  yeah  I was  suspicious  of that  and I  didn't want  to know  anymore  but now  Jimmy's  saying it  so  is that a  guy wearing  a bra  I don't know  it could go  nah  probably  I don't know  I don't know  with that  pointy bra  thing  you could  put a lot  of fat  meat  in there  and make  it look  like you  got cleavage  all right  hey Ed  you know  a thing  or two  about  home  invasions 
[01:01:00]  right  well  I don't  know  anything  about  them  I've  never  been  part  of  one  but I  sure  am  prepared  for  one  and  you  know  what  with  you  cranking  your  ting  tings  in  your  house  that  might  make  people  think  they got  an easy  target  oh  please  oh  please  don't  he tasks  me  Keith  actually  came over  the house  this morning  to  drag  garbage  out  you know  oh  that's  nice  of him  take  out  the  trash  and  he 
[01:01:30]  texts  me  he goes  I'll  be  taking  the  garbage  out  he goes  so  please  identify  your target  before  you  shoot  I  go  I was  like  don't  worry  I'll  just  wing  you  I  go  worst  case  scenario  I  just  wing  you  he goes  okay  please  nine  millimeter  or smaller  he's  already  knows  that  at  some  point  I'll  probably  shoot  him  what  does  wing  you  mean  just  kind  of  nick  you  a little  wing  you  but  he  yeah  he was  out there  this morning  nice  well we had  another home  invasion  overnight 
[01:02:00]  damn it  and I like  playing these  for you  because you  you  you're  what happened  you're  more than  prepared  for this  let me guess  armed citizen  I don't know  thwarted the crime  killing the home  invader  I don't know  I don't know  I don't like to  know the outcome  ahead of time  on these  we'll find out  together  let's learn  a man is  alerted  of an  impending  home invasion  by his  security  cameras  he arms  himself  and actually  shoots  and drives  away  the intruders  well  here's how  things went  down  see he's 
[01:02:30]  laughing  because  it worked  out nice  did you know  that  you heard  the story  no I  didn't  oh wow  I thought  it was  going to  be  you know  the phone  cord around  the neck  and watching  his wife  being sodomized  just out of  reach of  that gun  yep  you know  it's in  that drawer  and you're  like oh  oh look  how close  I am  see this  guy's got  cameras  spanners  yep  it was the  Diaz brothers  coming  yeah  Diaz brothers  were coming  for him  intruders  here's how  things went  down  four armed  suspects  attempted to  break into  his house 
[01:03:00]  when he  shot right  at the  suspects  he even  put a  bullet  through the  windshield  of the  suspect's  car  the four  men got  scared  and took  off  all of  them  remain  on the  run  the guys  like  wait till  you hear  this  you even  put a  bullet  through  their  windshield  of course  I don't  think I'd  go to  that  extent  you know  why  because  questionable  then the  authorities  like  now you're  in trouble  they were  trying to  leave  I don't  understand  that whole 
[01:03:30]  now you're  in trouble  when you  were just  minding  your own  business  you didn't  wake up  that morning  thinking I  was going  to shoot  my gun  someone  has invaded  your space  and now  you're supposed  to understand  exactly what  you can  and can't  do  I say  screw  that  when they  back off  and the  initial danger  is gone  you're not  allowed anymore  but that's  not fair  weird  you were put  in that  situation  yeah  a situation  you don't  want to be  in  right  a high  pressure  situation  that guy 
[01:04:00]  is probably  going to  say something  like  well  I  stepped  out  or  I  saw  the car  and I  saw  what I  believe  to be  a gun  coming out  of the  window  aiming at  me  and took  a few  shots  see  that to  me  is a  guy  even though  they're  outside  the house  who's  justified  we had  that  argument  time  about  I'm  going  out  I'm  going  to shoot  the  yeah  the guy  who shot  the two  unarmed  people  break into  his  neighbor's  house  and he  shot them  as they  were running  away  but this  guy  if four  guys  are trying  to break 
[01:04:30]  into your  house  I don't  care if  you follow  them to  7-Eleven  8 miles  away  and blast  them  you're  justified  in killing  them  harshly  dude  the video  is awesome  can we link  this  this guy  has got  some good  security  cameras  holy crap  this isn't  one of those  goofy 7-Eleven  cam  I want  this  this is  like  high  depth  security  camera  footage  we'll link  it on  onaradio.com  it's got  all kinds  of angles  it's like 
[01:05:00]  a three  camera  shoot  here comes  some guys  running  toward the  house  guns drawn  they mean  business  oh that guy  slipped  feet don't  fail me  now  they're  trying to  get back  into their  car  one guy  is trying  to get  his car  back  oh  wow  bye bye  that guy  changed his  tune real  fast  middle of  the afternoon  yep  oh yeah  that is  like  noon  something's  going on  though 
[01:05:30]  four black  dudes  running up  you wonder  if he was  a lot of  times  drug dealers  yeah  I'm thinking  this guy  might be  a little  suspect  in his  business  dealings  if he's  got that  kind of  security  right  and he's  ready  like that  in broad  daylight  to four  guys  running  to his  house  yep  pretty  amazing  so  it's on  a site  we  a site  that likes  to get  us in  trouble  breake fart  stupid  breake fart  it's on 
[01:06:00]  a bunch  of different  sites  so  if you  google  news  google  tucson  home invasion  you'll find  it  go everywhere  else except  that website  I just mentioned  if you can  and we'll link  it to  onaradio.com  it should be  linked in  a matter  of minutes  let's go  to ronnie  very upset  with us  ronnie  how you  doing  pretty good  what's up  ronnie  i was just  you know  i was listening  all the way  in this  morning  and you  guys were  making fun  of what  i certainly  took making  fun of  the air  disaster  today  you know  saying  i wonder  if this 
[01:06:30]  pilot thought  he was  going to  be  another  sully  and what  am i  going to  do  first  am i  going to  do  let him  in  or am  i  going to  do  leno  and really  make a  light of  situation  you know  punk is  fun  i want to  know what  was going  on  ronkis  ronkis  honestly we  we were  lightening up  the story  a little bit  but we  certainly  took it  very seriously  my friend  now the  point was  sir that  the pilot  going down  since sully  has become  like this  celebrity  so the  the point  was that  any pilot  in any  kind of 
[01:07:00]  trouble  right now  the first  instinct  is going  to be  oh i'm  going to  be a  celebrity  too  because of  what  happened  with him  i don't  think that's  a big  it's making  humor out of  a big stretch  to think  that a person  of mine  would work  that way  jimmy's  absolutely  right it's  more a  commentary  on the  media and  the way  they've  handled the  sully  incident  having him  all over  the place  and a  hero and  doing press  conferences  that any  pilot that  gets into  trouble these  days is  going to  think hey  i'm going  to be the  next sully  let me think  about a book  appearances  things like  that and  you know  i think we  took it 
[01:07:30]  doesn't work  out that  way  ronnie i  think we  took it  very seriously  i really  do i mean  we said how  we had  with this  sully  guy and  now you  know life  kicks you in  the teeth  and goes  well enough  with that  this is uh  the cold hard  reality  that these  plane crashes  do uh  kill everybody  fall out of  the sky and  everyone dies  it sucks  ronnie i'm  sitting here  wondering if i  know anybody  i know a lot  of people in  western new  york a lot of  people in  buffalo i'm  keeping my  fingers crossed  this morning 
[01:08:00]  so what's the  problem ronnie  you got some  objections is  that what it  is well you  know i mean  you know i  don't listen to  you guys to be  perfectly honest  i just happen to  hit the thing  so i'm not  familiar  wait wait wait  ronnie we  hate when  people say  he's got all  the features  but he's got  the number  yeah ronnie  i'm just saying  i'm not familiar  with your humor  ronnie i'm kind  of with you so  far i i don't  even really mind  that you were a  little offended  this morning but  you're trying to  say that you just  happened to hit  our our our  station today  no this is what  i actually did  you know i'm  listening to this  uh the fan on 
[01:08:30]  the way in and  boomer's uh  partner was driving  me crazy so i  just hit the button  oh he's such an  outrageous car that  guy yeah i can't  stand him  anyway you  just happened to  be there right  so all of a sudden  your station came  on and i wasn't  even aware that  there was a plane  crash so all of a  sudden i'm hearing  you guys do this  little skit and  you know i'm like  well that's a little  insensitive because i  don't even know  there's a plane crash  yet so then i hit  another station and i  hear there's a plane  crash and i'm like  oh my god these  guys certainly were  talking about an 
[01:09:00]  actual plane crash  that just happened  and i was just i  was amazed by the  insensitivity at  which i perceived  that you handled  this situation  you know what  ronnie why would  you care like i  don't understand  like i like i  don't comprehend  as as a as an  american as somebody  listens to the radio  and watches tv like  you do why would  you be concerned  with the attitude of  other adults when it  has nothing to do  with you i don't  understand why that  would affect you in  any way shape or  form i don't  comprehend that  you can't understand  why 49 people are 
[01:09:30]  dead and i just  perceived two guys  making light making  fun of the situation  parodying the  situation you don't  understand how as a  normal human being i  would find that so  offensive no i don't  and i'll tell you why  i'll tell you why  because there's been  plenty of things that  have been made fun of  that i don't find  offensive and i i want  to know are you  offended by the fact  that stephen king as a  as an artist or  whatever writes about  children being murdered  like i i don't look at 
[01:10:00]  things that way so  why is it that with  humor people have this  asterisk they put next  to it with what's  appropriate and yet if  somebody wrote a song  about it you'd be like  wow that's really good  that that artist expressed  themselves like that  or if they wrote a  story about it you'd be  like wow that's really  good that that artist  expressed themselves  like that but if  people are addressing  something awful in  humor all of a sudden  you're violated and  offended stephen king's  a fiction writer this is  something these bodies  are still burning and you  guys are making fun of  like that good point  ronnie good point you  got jimmy good there 
[01:10:30]  yeah you really did but  a fiction writer is  still capitalizing on  something that does  happen of course he is  okay so so what but  this is a real life  situation  it's real life  jimmy  you're wondering if  some of your friends  turn about fair play  yep  ronnie i gotta say you've  turned two out of three  of us around  right the third one  you're working on pretty  well here you're  convincing me how about  the uh how about the  song angle then ronnie  or how about the uh  the story angle if you  if you want to hide  behind stephen king  writes fiction how 
[01:11:00]  about the uh the song  angle or the uh the  story angle or like  writing a uh a book  about it  writing a book about  it's fine  why is that okay  you're not making fun  of tragedy  oh so i'm saying  okay what i'm saying  is why is it with  humor that's the place  that people choose  their self-righteous  indignation  tell them why ronnie  you know  we all know  bad ronnie  help me out on this  one i look at  no we're with you ronnie  but you got it  about  my self-righteous  indignation  yes he's making 
[01:11:30]  light  i don't like that  they made fun of  that  i as a person  have never concerned  myself  or been violated  or offended by what  other people  were making fun of  i i've never in my  life been bothered  by that  because when you  write a book or  something you're  reporting on the facts  in humor and comedy  you were just making  light of a tragedy  and people have  uh perished  families are upset  and you're going on  just making jokes  about it  uh i i too was 
[01:12:00]  offended  but mike  as that was happening  i know i know you  were i saw it on your  face and heard it in  your impression of  the uh of the thing  and pointing out that  it was woman pilot  you were you were  offended  but what i'm saying  is if you write a  book like about  serial killers say  and even though you're  just documenting what  happened you are  directly profiting  from the photos of  murder victims  so i want to know  uh those are real  things that happened  and i would like to  know how many  publishing houses  you've called when  you've seen books on  the shelves and said  how are they directly  profiting from the  photos of these  murdered people 
[01:12:30]  buddy you are  completely out of  your mind  no i'm really not  no you really are  no i'm not  you talk about making  a giant leap from  point a to point z  uh yeah  it's incredible  how is that a big  well how is that a  big leap  because you go all  the way to z  with the way that  people uh  an artist or  whatever or a  performer addresses  something that  happened that is  real and that is  tragic why do you  have a different set  of standards for  humor that you do  for songwriters or  authors that's not a 
[01:13:00]  big leap at all  one is chronicling a  event that happened  the other one is  making fun of an  event that is  happening in front  of our eyes right  now where you've  got family members  and you've got  friends sitting by  the radio on the  television looking  saying oh my god  i hope i don't know  anybody on this  flight and all of a  sudden somebody's  making fun of it  so if you're  chronicling good  point ronnie so  if you're if you're  chronicling uh the  murder victims through  photos and stuff like  that and making a 
[01:13:30]  profit of it that's  acceptable but  addressing it in  humor is not  uh-oh ronnie he  might have you there  he doesn't have me  it's ridiculous  ronnie my whole  career  nothing to do with  the other  apples and oranges  jimmy's talking  apples and oranges  nothing in history  that ever happened  exactly  exactly  that's what we  do we compile  facts what you're  saying what you're  saying is this ronnie  i've dealt with guys  like you my whole  career guys if you  hear something they  get offended at it  and you have to  justify why it was 
[01:14:00]  wrong for people to  address it in humor  yet if it was a  subject that wasn't  offending you you'd be  telling somebody oh  come on lighten up was  just a joke most things  you make fun of have  somebody that's going  to be bothered by it not  all things but most  next thing you know  someone on this show  will be making hitler  jokes and then exactly  and that's when i walk  that would be crazy i  completely agree with  what you said  you speak our language  trust me  that just about every  human being would be  offended by what you  said today making fun  of an air accident 
[01:14:30]  that so far 49 people  have died and you  don't think that there's  anything wrong  completely  i don't know how it was  made fun of  yeah and by the way  how it was made fun of  the actual accident  yeah  the actual accident  you're actually saying  that as the plane is  going down the pilot  instead of thinking  about how the hell am i  going to excuse me  how the heck am i going  to save  a hypothetical  a hypothetical  fake pilot  you're saying wow  here's my chance for fame  i could be another  sully  gee  am i going to do 
[01:15:00]  letterman first or  should it be leto  isn't that a commentary  isn't that a commentary  more on the way they  put sully on every  single show and you've  been seeing them on the  news than it is us  making fun or making  light of the death of  people in an air crash  did we actually sit here  and make light of the  fact that people died  we could have we could  have made jokes like  that we didn't we made  jokes about  really  so good we were only  partially sick  ronnie you got another 
[01:15:30]  example of us making  light and making a joke  out of the tragedy that  happened up there in  buffalo  no i only heard a little  bit that's all i heard  what was it again i don't  i don't i don't remember  just so we're all clear  what what was the joke  that was made on this  show  joke was what i just  told you the pilot is  thinking to himself am i  going to do letterman or  should i do leto you  know this is what you're  saying  and comparing it to  sully yeah  there is a lot of  sully stuff going on  yes 
[01:16:00]  so uh  could you just frunkus  us and get this  over with  ronnie  yes  could you just frunkus  us  he's not a frunkus  guy  what is a frunkus  i don't even know  what it is  what was what was  happening in the  boomer show that  was so outrageous i  mean it must have  been crazy if it got  you to turn this  station  what's that craig  guy up to these  days  craig horton actually  has to do is speak  to get me uh  you know  wow you're an easily 
[01:16:30]  bothered guy ronnie  boomer broke my arm so  how about that i'm  offended  well guys all i want to  say is look i thought it  was unbelievably  of course you did  of course you did  and but you don't think  that it was in the  slightest bit  insensitive  no  you should listen to our  show you should hear what  we talk about when we  talk about um  people starving in uh  foreign countries and  people being blown up  and beheaded and things  like that  well guys i think i'm  going to take a pass on  the invitation but thanks  for taking my call  we'll go back to the  outrageous sports show 
[01:17:00]  when that offends you  come back to the show  and act like you didn't  know what the show was  ronnie let me ask you  something before you  leave is it okay to  make fun of the  titanic  is it okay to make fun of  the titanic  yes  well i'll put it to you  this way i wouldn't be  as outrageously offended  as i was today because  well over over a thousand  people died on that  yeah  children died  frozen  time kills all  time yet out  heals all wounds  how long ronnie  ronnie  how long can we wait  how long 
[01:17:30]  how long can we wait  a couple years  until we can make fun  of things  wait until the bodies  are cold at least boys  how's that sound  okay so that's your  that's your thing  hey it was buffalo  they were very cold  oof  there you go  wow  there you go  hey what more can i say  you know i mean  if you're going to make  a statement like that again  but ronnie do you hear  what you're saying  like this is  this is what drives  people crazy  with humor  this is like  when a guy like you  will call  and this is why i said  it was self-righteous  indudation  because then he points  out something right  like the titanic  and it's like  you're like wow 
[01:18:00]  it was a long time ago  i didn't feel anything  so because you  personally  or any of us of course  don't remember it  or didn't know anybody  it's okay  do you understand  that stupid little  that little invisible  line you're painting  people who are truly funny  normally don't paint  that line  and that to me  is what's bothering me  about what you're saying  that's not really  an invisible line guys  that's human nature  i mean if something  happened in the second century  obviously i am not going to be  as personally  as something that is happening 
[01:18:30]  in front of my eyes  human nature  you're watching on the tv  hold on ronnie  human nature  kind of like gallows humor  kind of like when things happen  that are tragically  people throughout their lives  learn to respond  to dealing with horrible things  through humor  so that's kind of  human nature too  isn't it  yes it is  okay well then  why is your version  of human nature  more valid  and ours offensive  yours was offensive today  yours was absolutely offensive  offended you  offended you ronnie  but then again  craig carton  offends you 
[01:19:00]  so there's two things  on the radio  that you're listening to  that bother you  why are you not  let me ask you something  does craig carton  offend you  i honestly don't know  what craig carton  does i know who he is  but i've never  would he offend me  no  he probably would  i like his brother milk  ronnie i'm so  i'm so  i'm so difficult to  i'm not offended  who are you anyway  it doesn't  does it matter who i am  i'm not offended  no i was just curious  i don't even know your name  my name is jim  doesn't matter  i'm not offended  by what other people say 
[01:19:30]  when expressing  themselves  politically or in humor  even if i don't like it  paul moody's a comic  a pretty radical black comic  says a lot of things  that i completely disagree with  but i've never been offended  by humor in my life  ever  well i  see the difference is here  i didn't find  what you said to be humor  you didn't  but you knew the tone  in which it was said  otherwise you wouldn't  have called and said  why are you making  making fun of it  you knew the intent  was humor  so don't back out  that's a really weak intent  i thought it was  mean spirited 
[01:20:00]  not humorous  i found nothing humorous  about it  i didn't even find it  as a  i guess  if i really think about it  i guess it was a  very feeble attempt  okay you didn't like  the joke  but you did know  it was a joke  um  don't lie  just be honest  no no no  did i know it was a joke  not particularly no  and i don't think  you thought we were  reporting  you thought we were  doing a news report  you didn't even think  it was a real plane crash  so you obviously  thought it was something  so you thought you  were hearing plane crash  news and you just  turned it off  i didn't know it was 
[01:20:30]  a real plane crash  then why would we  be talking about it  if it wasn't done in humor  we started off by saying  it was a real story  no no  i wasn't outraged  you didn't listen  when i first heard it  i wasn't outraged  i didn't know what  you were talking about  when i went to the  other station  and realized that  it was indeed  a real plane crash  then i became outraged  the fact that you  became outraged  is embarrassing  embarrassing to whom  for you  the fact that you  be outraged  you're anointed  craig carton  he bothers you  i'm outraged 
[01:21:00]  at that humor  you're just one  of those guys  that wants to be heard  you're outraged  too much  yeah stop being so  outraged  it's boring  he annoys me  he annoys you  you're outraged  what else bothers you  ronnie  what else on tv  or in the media  is offensive to your  your violates  your set of  of what should be  made fun of  or spoken about  or expressed  let me ask you  something  what outrages you  oh  honestly  you  people  like yourself  who 
[01:21:30]  find what other  people say  to be bothersome  and feel the need  to call  and snivel  about it  honestly  i've never  had that urge  i'm 40 years  old dude  i've never  had that urge  people call  and be what  about it  and snivel  about it  oh snivel  yeah  i see  you called  the radio station  and went on  the air to go  i didn't like  what you made  fun of  and it's never  occurred to me  to do that  right so i don't  have the right  to call you  sure you do  ronnie  well i didn't  question your right 
[01:22:00]  we took your call  ronnie  what do you  find funny  yeah what is  your humor  you obviously  don't like our  humor so what  do you find  funny ronnie  i don't say  i don't like  your humor  i didn't like  i've never  heard of you  guys  regardless  so i may  find you  guys hysterical  okay all right  all right we  get it ronnie  but what do you  find funny  i find a lot  of things funny  like what  give us an  example  what do you  like find  funny  no you know  because we  attempted humor  today what do  you find funny  seriously  just say  something  a movie 
[01:22:30]  okay i find  i find jay leno  funny how's that  what's that  i find jay leno  funny  very funny  guy  you ever hear  him do  rape jokes  not that i  recall  i possibly have  not that i  recall  what was the  funniest movie  you ever saw  what is the  animal house  all right so  far you know  we're kind of on  the same page  underage sex  yeah  drinking  yeah  date rape  there's a nice  date rape scene  in there  that was pretty 
[01:23:00]  funny right  with an  underage  girl  actually  guys you're  not talking  to the most  prudish guy  in the world  right here  okay  i'm not  i found this  particularly  offensive because  of the subject  matter at the  time  understandable but  we're pointing out  that when people  are offended at  humor their  offense is so  inconsistent and  that's why i never  take it seriously  because the little  morality thing that  flag the people  wave when it  comes to something  that just happens  to bother them  is completely  inconsistent  well i'm not  going to 
[01:23:30]  wave a flag  about something  that bothers  someone else  i'm not  concerned about  what bothers  someone else  i can't be  thank you  thank you ronnie  right i could  only be  outraged at  what  there you go  me  so why should  we in any  way shape  or form  be concerned  about what  bothers  somebody else  we have the  same human  nature you  do  we care about  us  just you care  about you  and your  sensibilities  and everybody  else on the  planet is the  same  hey hold  on do you  understand that  you are one 
[01:24:00]  person that is  offended by  something and  every word that  comes out of our  mouth somebody  will find it  offensive so if  we just stopped  doing what  everyone found  offensive we  wouldn't be able  to even open  our mouths  that might be a  good idea actually  but oh snap  so why are you  going to say  that oh why  because everybody  else how about  how about with  some things you  say offend people  and you don't  open your mouth  here's the thing  you don't have  to be concerned  with what  outrages me 
[01:24:30]  I'm simply  calling you  and saying  this is what  I felt  but you needed  to be heard  and you gave  me a form  to do it  you needed  to be heard  why did you  need to be  heard on it  that's what  I don't get  so you called  the radio station  to talk about  what bothered  you instead  of just going  no that's not  for me and  moving on  let me get you  this way guys  this is the first  time I've ever  called the radio  station in my life  I believe you  and I didn't  have to be on  the radio to do  this I simply  you wanted to  call and complain 
[01:25:00]  to the management  I wanted to  no I said I  wanted to speak  to you guys  and you were  nice enough  to put me  through  all you could  have done  was answer  said you know  what I'll call  you back when  the show is  over that would  have been  why would we  call you  what are you  nuts  who are you  Friday  we'll call you  back when the  show is over  I'm dodging  savages on  the road  I'm going to  be calling  this I  didn't need  the forum  of a live  radio show  but you  needed to  connect with  the people 
[01:25:30]  who said  it and tell  them that  it bothered  you you  needed to  be heard  but it's  silly I  don't get  it  your entire  livelihood is  needing to  be heard  yes it's my  job  exactly  exactly  what do  you do  you know  so you  decided to  go into  this profession  because of  your unbelievable  desire to be  heard  yes  I  I've ever  done in  my life  it's going to  knock me  for needing  to be heard  when you  can't even  exist without  being heard  because you  need to be  heard because  you want to  tell people  that your  feelings were 
[01:26:00]  hurt or  that you  were bothered  by something  or you need  to scold  somebody it's  silly you're  not making a  living off it  you're not  entertaining people  doing it it's  for your own  satisfaction  what do you  do what do  you do  what do you  do Ronnie  I work as  the financial  services  another scumbag  you're one of  these asses  that we  got to  bail out  is that it  is that what  you are  Wall Street  guy Ronnie

[01:32:30]  2U  3D  you won't  believe this  brother Joe  has been in  his basement  like a  mad scientist  putting this  together  and it really  is unbelievable  it's a multimedia  retrospective  introspective  that spans  U2's career  via live  concerts  by 2U  of course  the world's  second best  U2 show  performing  simultaneously  with synchronized  original 
[01:33:00]  U2 video  on a giant  screen  so to a  T  they are  playing  on stage  and to a  T  it matches  up with  the video  of U2  that's behind  them on a  giant screen  how the F  is he doing  that  amazing  Joe's  like a  rocket  scientist  when he  wants to  be  this is  at the  Dix Hills  Performing Arts  Center  in  Five Towns  College  it's  tonight  February 13  starts at  7pm  tickets are

[01:34:00]  giant screen  U2 playing  and the band  is exactly  in sync  with the videos  that are going  on behind  them  so it's  very cool  I'm a tough  critic  and I gotta  tell you  Brother Joe's  U2 band  I went and  saw U2  at the  garden  and then  he was at  where was it  House of Blues  I think  doing an  after U2  party  and I went  there to  hear a lot  of the songs  that the  real band  didn't do  at the  garden  they didn't  play  and sounded  just like  the band  it was 
[01:34:30]  awesome  check that  out  I'm not  sure if I  like the  new U2  song yet  not really  sure if I  like it  there's  some  U2 songs  gotta grow  on me  there's a  couple  that  that hit  me  right away  Vertigo  Vertigo  was one  that like  right away  I like that  beautiful day  gets right  into your soul  some of them  gotta grow  on you  City of  Blinding Lights  from the last  album was  amazing  if you're  into U2  I'm a big 
[01:35:00]  U2  they just  don't reach  me  I don't  know why  I don't  think they  suck  they just  never reach  me  I like  them  Joshua Tree  is still  one of my  favorite  CDs of all  time  what's the  big song  of that  everything  where the  streets have  no name  without you  I like  a little  song called  Red Hill  Mining Town  too obscure  to play here  today  the streets  have no  name  how does  that go  where the  streets  have no  name  that doesn't  sound like a  fun town  I want the  streets  have names  very hard 
[01:35:30]  to navigate  turn down  that street  and then  that street  make a left  on the other  street  and you'll  be there  when I was  wandering  America  when we  were off  the air  I found  myself  in  Phoenix  Arizona  and I  decided  I'm going  to drive  to LA  because I  have no  one to  report to  I have  nothing to  do  and I'm  on the  highway  from Phoenix  to LA  and all of a sudden  I see  Joshua Tree  National Park  I'm like  this is perfect  U2 fan  nothing to do 
[01:36:00]  no one to  report to  I'm going to  go see the  trees man  that made  the Joshua Tree  album so famous  and what did  you say  holy  man did  they trick  me and got  me off  that highway  oh man  I know  you know  this  oh I've  been to  Joshua Tree  oh so you  know  oh yeah  I had to  finally give  up  no joke  20 to  30 miles  in  and it  wasn't  20 to  30 miles  of highway  in  it's like  a two lane  road that's  windy and  curvy  and after  a while  they turn  into dirt  roads  right  once you  get into  like well 
[01:36:30]  this is  years ago  anyway  once you  get into  Joshua Tree  a little  town called  Joshua Tree  and you  get in  there and  the houses  are there  but the  streets  and maybe  that's where  the streets  have no  name because  they're just  dirt roads  right  that are on  kind of a  grid and  these houses  are there  and there's  these you  know Joshua  trees that  just look like  nuclear  wreckage trees  I was so  bummed  because I  finally had  to give  up  I'm like  I'm not  going to  get to  see the  Joshua  trees  you know  because I  think it  said something  like another  50 or 60 
[01:37:00]  miles and  the 20  miles took  when I  tell you  the 20  miles took  well over  an hour  I'm like  I'm going  to do this  for another  50 or 60  no effing  way  so I  turned it  around  when you're  driving in  the desert  everything is  forever away  yeah  it just  really is  it looks  like it's  right there  I swear  to you  when we  used to  do that  camping  thing out  in the  Mojave  desert  it would  take  forever  to get  there  and you'd  be in  the middle  of nowhere  and have 
[01:37:30]  to turn  off and  do another  50 miles  from nowhere  from like  the last  piece of  crap gas  station  I loved  it though  I loved  that there  was nothing  I loved  I should  have done  this stuff  when I was  younger  I got the  opportunity  when we  got fired  I did the  ride from  LA to  Vegas for  the first  time  that ride  ruled  there's a  feeling out  there in  the middle  of the  desert  it's awesome  and I'm not  talking about  on the road  or anything  off the 
[01:38:00]  beaten path  when you  step out  of the  vehicle  shut it  off  and just  stand there  and listen  and smell  and just  look around  it is the  eeriest  it's like  almost  spiritual  I swear  to you  it's almost  for me  who is the  most unspiritual  person  it really  you're kind  of standing  there just  like hearing  every little  breeze blowing  across the  little grass  that's poking 
[01:38:30]  up out of  the sand  it's just a  fantastic place  to just  hang out  I got something  for you  why when you're  in that situation  that you just  explained  why is the sky  higher  you know what  I'm talking  about though  right  why does it  look so much  higher  the cloud  everything just  looks higher  what is that  I guess it's  because they don't  have that layer  of goop  that the cities  pump out  to make it  look lower  it's so bizarre  to me though  yeah it's a  deep blue 
[01:39:00]  and then at  night  unless you've  been there  you cannot  even understand  what the stars  look like  when there's  no glare  from a city  there's no  city within  hundreds of  miles of you  so and you're  in the middle  of the desert  it's pitch  blackness  and then the  stars you  actually see  white across  the side  it almost  looks white  there's so  close together  that it just  looks like a  white streak  of you know  our galaxy  the Milky Way  when we're not  picked up by the 
[01:39:30]  new company  over there  on satellite  I'm going to  go see the  Joshua trees  you're going to  do that  finally see  those Joshua trees  I'm going  I'm finally going  to see them  Joshua trees  I'm going to  send out a  Twitter alert  hey meet me  at the Joshua  trees  I'm leaving  today  I'll see you  there  what are they  they're just  a bunch of  trees  why would they  sing about  they're so  weird looking  they're just  bizarre  trees  I don't know  the history  of them  I don't care  I just know  they were on  the album cover  I'm like  alright I'm  going there  it's the whole  thing of just  being out  in nowhere 
[01:40:00]  I loved it  I loved it  driving to  Vegas  I was out  of my mind  because I never  saw anything  like that  in my entire  life  of course I  was dressed  like the  Camry Rouge  but  really  Paul in  Jersey  I hate  you too  this offends  me  oh no  oh boy  oh boy  he's offended  oh boy  oh Uncle  Paul  I heard that  chuckle  Mark today  I got something  in common  with Stephen  S. from  Bayshore 
[01:40:30]  he loves  Red Hill  Mining Town  too  too obscure  Jimmy  can't go  there  I don't  know how  any of them  go  can't go  there  I still  haven't  found  what I'm  looking  for  but the  gospel  singers  if you get  the right  version  I still  haven't  found  what I'm  looking  for  I don't  think it's  great  I think it's  okay  the whole  album  it's one of  those rare  albums  that has  yeah  kind of  like  every song  is good  like  Sabotage  yeah  you don't  know this  song  this  yeah  oh you  know  what's  called  this 
[01:41:00]  is  okay  this  I'm  still  I  kind  of  like  the  I  that's  not  my  name  that's  not  my  name  you  didn't  really  get into  U2  huh  no  I  wasn't  a big  U2  fan  until  maybe a  few years  back  kind of  got turned  on to  it  right  yeah  Rattle and  Harm is  a great  album  because  they  inject 
[01:41:30]  a lot  of  gospel  into  that  they  were  too  political  and it  annoyed  me  when  Bono  they  were touring  the US  once  and it's  like  Bono  has  shunned  the press  and he's  going to  let his  music  do the  talking  and I  was just  like  shut  up  you  pompous  ass  I  have  a way  of  separating  those  two  because  Bono  is  trying to  save  the world  thing  I'm like  whatever  I just  like what  you're doing  with your  music  I can  separate  I really 
[01:42:00]  can  did you like  the mulleted  Bono  the mulleted  the early  days  you were at  the garden  for the  famous  thing  where  there  wasn't  a dry  eye  in the  house  I have  no problem  admitting  I bawled  like a  little  girl  man  what was  the song  they played  one  I think  they played  one  and then  they showed  everyone  that was  lost  down there  at  ground  zero  9-11  they showed  the names  list of the  planes  people in 
[01:42:30]  the building  and the  names  it was like  a credit  roll  it went  on forever  it was just  like oh my  god  I got chills  thinking about  by the time  that song  ended  people were  looking at  strangers  just going  yeah I'm  with you  man  this is  just a  moment  that I'll  never  forget  could you  pass me  that dupe  as far as  concert moments  that's  probably my  biggest highlight  right there  yeah that was  a biggie  although the  letter to  Skinner and I  certainly don't  want to compare  the two  because I  know  idiots out 
[01:43:00]  there ready  to jump  on anything  we do  play some  Skinner  but when I  saw Leonard  Skinner at  Darien Lake  when they got  back together  they finally  decided about  after 10  years  you know  what it  sucks that  we lost  our  oh the  mullet guy  god damn  forget about  that  that's from  the live  aid and all  that right  yeah  the Leonard  Skinner though  after 10  years  they go  look we  lost our  league guy  but there's  still fans  out there  that want  our music  and you  know there's  20 guys  in our  band  so why  don't we  get his  younger  brother  so the  younger  brother 
[01:43:30]  comes out  and he  was awesome  sounds like  his older  brother  but then the  moment that  they were  going to play  Freebird  I love telling  this story  all of a sudden  what's the  younger  Van Zandt  is it  Donnie  I know  Ronnie  there's  Ronnie  there's  Donnie  there's  Johnny  I get  them all  confused  but you  know  who I'm  talking  about  it's not  Ted Van  Zandt  I'm as free  as a bird  now  birds are very  free  we have that  in common  Gregory  yeah 
[01:44:00]  they did  that at  the Super  Bowl  too  but at  the Garden  it was even  more impressive  the U2  thing  anyway  so  the Van  whatever  Ronnie  Johnny  or Donnie  whatever  I think  Donnie  was in  38  special  actually  he got  the short  end of the  stick  all of a  sudden he's  like  you know  this next  song  there's only  one guy  that  should sing  this song  and unfortunately  he's not  here  so  you know 
[01:44:30]  this goes  out to  him  and then  he takes  his hat  his older  brother's  hat  puts it  on the  mic stand  there's  one stupid  freaking  light on  the mic  stand  just  thinking  of the hat  on the mic  I actually  don't have  one  the hat  on the mic  stand  I was just  thinking  it's kind  of smoldering  oh jeez  still smoldering  they just  kept it lit  eternally  anyway  and then  Paul did  that  Paul did  that for  George Harrison  but then  all you heard  was glub 
[01:45:00]  glub  from the  pudding  in the  microphone  why tell  a story  right  why tell  a story  who cares  look up  the story  online  no go ahead  I'm sorry  I forgot  these guys  don't have  an emotional  bone  in their  body  stupid  me  stupid  me  I forgot  I'm dealing  with two guys  that don't have  a soul  and nothing  nothing like  gets them  gets them  chilling  are you saying  Paul to do that 
[01:45:30]  to George  put a plastic baggie  over the mic  first  why show an  emotion  you're right  go with the  tumor jokes  for another  ten minutes  I'm sorry  I was  mistaken  I was  mistaken  that's terrible  alright  they put a  hat there  on the  mic stand  now no one  sang  no  they just  did an  instrumental  version  did the crowd  sing  yeah  there wasn't  a dry eye  in the house 
[01:46:00]  but now  they do it  to the point  where now  it's like  whatever  it's not  even that  special  I want  someone to  sing it  I think  he finally  started singing  it finally  I think  if I know  my skinner  and that's  a long  instrumental  but they  were right  there  they sang  the whole  effing song  and there  was one  light on  the  head  my hat  the hat  what about  the hat  but he got  his hat  it's on  the mic stand  his hat 
[01:46:30]  stupid dice  in his hat  he should have  put a curly  wig on the  mic stand  and sang  the Brady  bunch  theme song  the stand  still would have  had to lose  weight  base 2  covered  all we need  is a good  modesto joke  and we can  go home  and we'll  have the  final check  oh god  that would be  terrible 
[01:47:00]  this guy just  drove through  Joshua Tree  yesterday  John in Utah  John what did  I miss  well  not a lot  I mean  they're kind  of impressive  as far as  like looking  at weird  plants  but  it is  desolate  it's  a lot  of nothing  out there  I mean  the only way  we knew  where we  were delivering  to  was we  had to  have a  GPS  coordinate  oh really  I think  I didn't  miss anything  no GPS  in the old 
[01:47:30]  days  when me  and foot  and bison  took a  Camaro  cross country  yeah  I'll tell you  that  drove through  the desert  lost an  alternator  to get  that fixed  in some  bum  F town  and then  did they  just rape  you  oh yeah  they just  were like  oh this is  going to be  $2,000  oh hell yeah  and they  would stop  for gas  before  like that  road  that looks  like the  road  where Sarah  Connor  got gas  and then  drove off  into the  storm  that's  exactly  what it  looked like  oh man  yeah  really  it was just 
[01:48:00]  here you go  last chance  gas  good luck  to you  don't they  have signs  too if you  don't fill up  here you  will run out  you're done  we got this  figured out  here  you're so  conscious  of your  gas too  at that  point  where you're  looking at  your tank  and going  okay it's  25 miles  to the next  gas station  you'll see  the sign  you start  looking at  the gas  station  going  I can't  make this  because you  know you  can't just  be like  hey dude  could you  take me  up to the  gas station  because there's  no one on  the road  but that was  20 years ago  you've got to  think now  you're never  going to run 
[01:48:30]  out of gas  if you're  paying attention  to your  instruments  but it's  kind of creepy  to think  20 years ago  or whatever  it was  that you still  had a chance  to actually  not find a  gas station  you'd have to  lean over a little  so the gas  gauge  you'd look at  it and it  would come  out of the  red  because of  your angle  the way  you're looking  at it  you put your  head way  against the  driver door  and go  alright  they wouldn't  put a gas  gauge in  that could  let me see  that if I  still have  gas  if I'm  leaned over  out my  window  they wouldn't  allow that  I don't know  why my wife's 
[01:49:00]  with me  are you reading  everyone's mind  right now  what are you  doing  that's magic  she reminded me  of the  Cape Cod  running out  of gas  story  why is she  with me  she's  looking down  at my  now  old car  and  she goes  we're going  to make it  I'm like  yes  we're going  to make it  we got it  and I think  it's what  Route 6  up there  in Cape Cod  don't be silly  run out  of gas  way short 
[01:49:30]  of the  exit  came up  a little  short  way short  and then we  take a ride  from some  pot smoking  kids in a  van  all tatted  up  and this is  the van  where they  didn't have  seats  and they go  we'll get  you to a  gas station  did you help  them with a  couch  they throw us  in the back  of the van  with these  you took  your wife  in the back  of a van  she was my  girl  I was still  feeling it out  it wasn't  like caring  like now  now I  gotta really 
[01:50:00]  care for it  no  and I  went in  the back  of this  van  no seats  everyone's  hanging around  just talking  music  and going  to some  tat show  or seeing  a band  I forget  now  they're all  smoking pot  and then the  guy  oh to get  in the back  of the van  he takes  out a key  and undoes  the padlock  in the back  of the van  and I still  jumped in  with my girl  are you out  of your mind  there it is  that's the road  and then we  sat in the van  with all these  kids as they're  smoking pot  talking music  and then the  guy takes off  going about  100 miles 
[01:50:30]  on route 6  somewhere on  Cape Cod  to get me  to the exit  I was out  of my mind  scared  how long  from the exit  were you  it was a while  it was easily  a 10-15 minute  ride  easily  I was so  short on this  one  why did you  stop and get  gas before  I had it  figured out  I thought  and then I was  like oh my god  the next exit  is 10 miles  I'm like oh  this isn't good  oh no  oh no  and I knew it  too and I'm like  oh please  maybe there's 
[01:51:00]  a gas god  oh boy  I've been sitting  on the floor  of this horrible  van and then  he locks us in  gets us in  and then locks us  because that was  the only way  to keep the doors  shut  so if the thing  crashed  we would have  been asked  we wouldn't  have been able  to pop out  of that thing  no  we used it  to like  bring people  over the border  or something  yeah I don't  know  they ended up  cool  I lucked out  that time  you certainly  did  you know  I'm here  I own  some like  independent  record store  in Boston  I got a good  story out of it 
[01:51:30]  what the hell  I was always  petrified to do  anything like  take rides from  people  hitchhiking  my mother used  to just like  put the fear  in me  yeah  they're awful  people  they're gonna  chop your head  off  they're gonna  kill you  I was a dope  I used to  hitchhike from  Geneseo to  Buffalo to fly  home  and I would  take a steak  knife and put it  in my sock  and then I would  just pop my thumb  out and take a  ride  in case someone  attacks you with  a filet mignon  but then here's  me thinking I  could fight off  anybody with a  steak knife  steak knife  so I had it 
[01:52:00]  in my sock  yeah  I would  then pop my  thumb out  and then whoever  picked me up  whatever  punch you  you'd fall  for the best  cut your  Achilles tendon  right  and then I  would always  just throw the  steak knife in  the garbage  as I was going  into the airport  you know security  was way more  lax back then  yeah  you probably  could have  like carried  that on the  plane almost  and just  handing my own  knife  for a meal  alright  we'll mop up  next right  mop  get the mop  out  sky is higher  because there's  no hills  I don't know  what it is  when you're out  west in the  desert  the sky just 
[01:52:30]  looks way higher  giant mountains  in the desert  I climbed up  one of those  things once  and just stood  at the top  could see  for so far  it was ridiculous  did Mickey and  Mallory sleep  with you  no no  they didn't  sleep with me  Mickey and  Mallory  nice yes  I really like  the desert  the Mojave  desert  I mean  it's a great  place to  just be  just to hang  out there  of course  you know  shooting everything 
[01:53:00]  that moves  is a lot of  fun too  I liked it  out there  it's just  so weird  it's an alien  world  it's like  no other  even a small  town  it's a town  it's a community  there's people  there  you are  just  alone  out there  whoever you're  with  that's it  can I tell you  the greatest  place I've ever  been  greatest place  you've ever  been  I'm going  to say  in America  in America  for me  let me guess  Trenton  Trenton's up  there Jimmy  write that F up  there  there's a tough  decision  between Sedona 
[01:53:30]  or Sedonia  Sedona  Arizona  is the most  amazing place  I've ever  been  you sure it's not  Sedona  Sedona  S-E-D-O-N-A  with the red  rocks and stuff  it is ridiculous  yeah  mountain biking  with my brother  in Sedona  was one of the  greatest  that's where  the harmonic  convergence  that was one  of the points  and you know  what that was  oh  and that was  before the  Grand Canyon  we stopped  in Sedona  before the  Grand Canyon  that's been  there forever  stop it  and I think  Sedona  I think Sedona  in many ways  was much cooler  than the Grand 
[01:54:00]  Canyon  yeah  yeah  it was amazing  effing amazing  man  alright  I like the episode  of the Brady Bunch  where they went  to the Grand Canyon  yes  father looked  into it  and said  that's nothing  all the donkeys  were going down  he's like  oh god  that's as many  mules  had more than that  bunch of mules  going into that  big hole  he kept yelling  lucky Grand Canyon  why the Mojave 
[01:54:30]  Desert ant  cause of the  like I said  if I was a  spiritual person  it's almost  spiritual  it's just  it's everything  there's a sound  and a smell  out there  that I'll  never forget  is it all  sand though  or is it  no no  it's mountains  and brush  and sand  and it's not  a desert  like the Sahara  desert  like people  just picture  sand dunes  there's mountains  and valleys  and we went  exploring through  these canyons 
[01:55:00]  where there's  just giant  boulders  that you know  were in that  same place  when like  dinosaurs  were walking  next to them  you know  and just  hadn't been  moved  it's just  the oldness  of it  is amazing  because we were  in a place  where there  was nobody  and it wasn't  a well-traveled  area  this was the  middle of the  Mojave Desert  in about  you know  the mid-70s  right  so  it was  just nothingness 
[01:55:30]  it was very cool  when did you  realize your life  means nothing  it's kind of  around that time  as far as the  time thing goes  you see a vastness  that is so much  bigger than you  like the Grand Canyon  like oh my god  and you realize  what a little blip  you are on the  radar screen  my moment was  I went  I was in the  hole  I think it's  HO  maybe  I think HO  rainforest  okay  I'm joking  right  I think it's called 
[01:56:00]  the HO  rainforest  this is many years  ago  with good old  John O'Brien  remember him  from AM  yes  went out to  Seattle to  visit him  and we went  into the  rainforest  and I saw  a tree  that was  probably  something like  400 years old  on the ground  in the rainforest  massive  like almost as  wide as this  room  what am I  looking at  like 15 feet  across easy  just down  in the forest  right  and there was  a tree  growing out  of this  that started  as a little 
[01:56:30]  nothing  that was  easily  8 feet  around  so a tree  was growing  out of a  tree  yeah  and the  tree  that fell  had a life  of easily  whatever  300-400  years  and now  the new  tree  was easily  into 200  years  I'm like  wow  okay  I get it  I get it  we really  got the  crappy end  of the  stick  as far  as long  it goes  on this  planet  yeah  but we  didn't  have to  just  wait  you  want  600  years  of just  standing  there  while birds  take  dumps  on you  I'd rather 
[01:57:00]  have  70  person  years  running  around  having  sex  what are  you gonna  do  drop  acorns  again  the sounds  here  no one  knows  if anyone  hears it  because I  don't have  ears  I have barked  bees live on me  thank god  Jimmy brings it right back  thank you Jimmy  it certainly  it certainly does  thank you  you can't even  grope  the thing  next to you  no  you gotta hope  some squirrel  carry stuff  just sucks  the wind  pushes you  over  but yeah  it was  it was like  some kind  of acorn  fell on  this tree  that was  rotting  in the forest  and  grabbed hold 
[01:57:30]  and then  it's  living its  life  through  this tree  that fell  in the  freaking  forest  Danny found  a good  picture there  that's  Mojave  yeah  it looks  like part  of it  why don't you  go back  out there  brush  what am I  going to do  now  when I was a  kid it was  fun  we had  dune buggies  and guns  and  oh you still  got guns  and you still  got kids  now probably  surveillance  that's probably  it wouldn't be  anything like I  remembered it  I just like  remember  we drove through  these towns  like that  were just  they were  big towns 
[01:58:00]  until the  freeway went  through  like Baghdad  there was a  place called  Baghdad  for real  out there  yeah  and Amboy  was another  place  and these  were just  like foundations  and then you'd  get out and  see these little  things like a  coffee can  from  like the  early 1900s  and stuff  love that  when it was  an old  mining town  is it pretty  much like  quote a ghost  town  there's nothing  happening anymore  exactly  I would love  to check that out  and it's just  the coolest  thing because  all you hear  is this  constant  like just 
[01:58:30]  wind kind  of blowing  through  and it's  very cool  I would  have no  problem spending  like days  there  I would just  camp there  I don't care  we were in  the old  woman mountains  they were  called  the old  woman mountains  an old  silver mine  and we stayed  in the mining  shack  and drank  tequila  when I was  13 years  old  we all  were armed  to the  teeth  with every  kind of  pistol  and rifle 
[01:59:00]  and machine  guns at that  point  I mean  they had  everything  you seem like  you want to be  armed out there  yeah  any stranger  because you'd  never bump  into anybody  unless they  meant you  no good  there's no  reason to  be out there  yeah I think  if you bump  into someone  else that  could be  a problem  yeah he's  trying to  speak  McLean  right  you know  some lunatic  that has  decided he's  the mayor  of ghost  town  yeah  exactly  comes out  of the  woodworks  take a break  he's going  nuts  you know 
[01:59:30]  when I had  that moment  of nothingness  where I realized  my life was  worthless  boss show  no  when I woke  up yes  no I was  I was in bed  with a gal  and I was  hearing the  hey look  don't be upset  it happens  to everybody  and I realized  I am of no  value as a man  you're nothing  I am  I am nothing  all right  opiate Anthony  we'll wrap up  next  it's been fun  just  just talking  just kind of 
[02:00:00]  hanging and  talking  with my pals  that's what I like  doing  my radio pals  I like yapping  we're all radio  pals  I got a text  from our friend  Roland  yeah  what did Roland  have to say  three stories  equal  gay  z  let me tell you  about A-Rod  the cellar  hey oh  hey oh  and I wrote back  like ha ha  you're right  and he said  tell me about  your garden  is next  so Roland  is giving us  a beating  Roland's a smart  ass 
[02:00:30]  he really is  we let him  too close to us  that was our  mistake  now we won't  miss him  yeah we do  miss Roland  we'll get him  back  fun fact  Grand Canyon  gets a quarter  I'll let this  guy say it  Adam in Boston  how are you  Adam  hey guys  what's going on  fun fact Friday  I'm trying to  bring it back  10,000 years  Grand Canyon  gets a quarter  deeper and a dime  wider  that's about it  wait  every 10,000 years  he gets a quarter  deeper and a dime  wider  oh my 
[02:01:00]  yeah like the  width of a quarter  deeper and the width  of a dime wider  I got it  even if it was  the length  does it matter  oh my god  wait wait  exactly  but that wind  is blowing a lot  of stuff around  it's not knocking  if I went to the  rim of the Grand  Canyon and took  my heel and  kicked off a part  that's five  dimes wide  I just made it  wider than that  yes  that just makes  us pathetic  like our lives  are useless  when we're  flashing the pan  like that  just put to  the perspective  I think your  fact is wrong  because I've 
[02:01:30]  heard that it  actually equals  85 cents  you're doing  a quarter  of a dime  which is  35 cents  I totally  disagree  it all depends  on what the  dollar is worth  at the time  so that your  economics are  off  this is a hike  you could do  at the Grand  Canyon  and you end up  in a part of  the Grand Canyon  and you start  imagining this  has  this is how it  has to be  to be on a  planet  another planet  yes  it is so foreign  to what you're  used to  far away land  there was not

[02:06:30]  cooling it off  but it's  still warm  the concrete  is still hot  from the chemical  reaction of it  drying  inside  as we speak  how do they  figure that out  isn't that amazing  rainy  yeah  that's a good  fun fact  that is a fun  fact  oh look at the  rhesus monkey  going at it  look at the  the woman one  is looking up  and going  tee hee  the old fish eye  how can a monkey  give a fish eye  she's going  that's all you got  that it  no she's going

[02:11:00]  first of all  intern david  executive intern  david is very  mad at sam  we'll get into  that in a second  but you know  how we have to  take all our  shit every day  and move it  from one studio  to the other  we're vagabonds  and we're the  stars of the show  so we just put  our coats on  and leave  we don't have  to fucking  carry anything  we have our  coats put on  us you mean  it's gotten to  the point where  actually kenny  will help us  with our coats  yes  and then the  interns have  to grab all  the equipment  and the heavy  shit and bring  it from one  studio to the  other  gather it up 
[02:11:30]  and I'm  watching this  whole thing  go down  and our  lovely  girl intern  the first woman  intern we've  had in a long  time  jill  was carrying  the heaviest  fucking stuff  that's the  gentleman  and intern  david  paul right  yeah it's paul  goes that's what  i've been telling  everyone i'm like  what the fuck  why are we  because paul  was carrying  his weight  trust me  he had a  huge bin  too  and right  behind him  was the  girl  with the  huge bin  i go david  what the fuck  the girl's  carrying the  huge bin  of stuff  and what  did david  say  david you 
[02:12:00]  said what  i said  because  i said  i said  because she's  a new  intern  and all  the new  interns  have to  start  out  you said  to me  everyone has  to carry  something  everyone's  got  what do  you want  from me  everyone's  got to  carry  something  which sort  of made  sense  until i saw  what was  in your  hands  that  looked like  it might  have been  a book  it might  have been  a book  the whole  first semester  when i was  here i had  to carry  a bin  all the  time  she's  a woman 
[02:12:30]  she's  a new  intern  all the  new  interns  have to  carry  bins  for the  whole  first  semester  fucking  faggot  he's  what  you're  just  a  fucking  idiot  look  it's  easy  to go  with  yeah  let her  carry  all the  heavy  shit  but i  want to  go  with another  angle  your parents  didn't teach  you how to  treat women  and ladies  it has nothing to do with her personally  if it was any other girl  they would still have to carry a bin  what the fuck's wrong with you  any other girl  this isn't the fucking marines  dummy  just because she's a member  of the intern team  right  of which you've  self-anointed yourself 
[02:13:00]  as executive  yes you did  shut up  who made you that  sam did  sam's a fucking  sam is a sarcastic idiot  who is goofing on you  he goofs on you  i didn't make myself  executive  why would you  yes you did  no  you acted stupid enough  for sam to realize  he could put that title on you  and you'd actually believe it  so you  you self-appointed yourself  sam did you  as a goof  you appointed him  executive intern right  maybe it's time to tell him 
[02:13:30]  david is executive intern  there's no such position  sure there is  there's not a position  no he isn't  that's how i see you  who's position a senior intern  yes there is  how are you senior fucking intern  because i've been here longer than any other interns  who appointed you senior intern  it just automatically  no no  that's not in any rule book  you dummy  a certain other intern  called himself senior intern  attaboy  hey  who called  ron called himself to me  senior intern all the time  he always said he was a senior intern  how is that  oh shit  how is that appointed 
[02:14:00]  how does  how does sam appoint you  senior intern  or executive  or executive  executive intern  which there is no such thing  as executive intern  but he did right  he did yes  he did  who's  who's bigger in this operation  sam or me  you  me  right  you're out  you're now executive intern  disappear  all right  that's it  oh my god  who do you think he's pointing at david  he is now executive intern  you are just an intern now  you've been fucking demoted 
[02:14:30]  okay fine  how does that feel  oh no  and sam can't do anything about it  no one else can  no one can override or veto this  okay  i am the almighty fucking fuhrer  yes you are  and i say  that you are just an intern  as a matter of fact  you're fucking bottom of the barrel intern  oh  she's fucking bigger than you right now  if she's carrying a heavy thing  you have every right  under my fucking uh jurisdiction  to say  hey  carry this  and and he can't fucking say no 
[02:15:00]  or you're out  and can i suggest some  what  i know you're the fuhrer and all  but how about  we twist this a little bit  and make her  executive intern  because of what happened today  you're out  you are now executive intern  how does that feel  what's your name  we don't even know your name yet  you can still put it on your resume  douchebag  so don't worry about it  what's your name  i'm jill  jill is now officially  the executive intern  there you go  sorry paul  i know you're trying  but you know  if it had to be someone 
[02:15:30]  i'd rather  all right  because you understand  how  you understand  how to take jimmy's got a problem  not even a problem  just a question  did david really do anything wrong  when  he  in an act of corporate responsibility  treated  all workers the same  now women complain  they don't want to be handled differently  they don't want to  they want to be treated as everyone else  and so david said  well  you're one of many  pick up that bin hole 
[02:16:00]  and meet me over at the next joint  you know what  david treated her  he dictated  that's all well and good  but we don't  we don't follow the corporate world  in this environment  she's a skirt  with some nice  nice cans  and then stuff  and now we're making  her executive intern  because david didn't treat her  like a woman  that's all  but if david would have treated her  like a woman  in a flirty way  or whatever  we would say  david you can't do that  oh no  so david's kind of  between  no  i'm all for  like you know  giving a little pinch to the hiney 
[02:16:30]  and saying  way to go toots  we still live in that world here  jimmy thank god  no offense  to you  the uh  fine female intern  i don't know  i thought david was doing a good job  barking out orders  he was carrying a book  and he goes  well we all gotta carry something  good to be the boss  and she's struggling  with her little  little woman arms  it's good to be the boss  that haven't seen  you know  weights ever in her life  can i add something  oh paul wants to add something  yes paul  ladies first  see  see that's how it goes david 
[02:17:00]  sexist  that's what your parents  should have taught you  no very sexist  ladies first  all right  go ahead  well today david found out  that i was an eighth black  so i think it might be  racially motivated  you what  you got black  all right  you're out  you are executive intern  paul  no  by default  we're looking at  the new executive intern  paul  people just have to listen  to 80% of what she says  so an eighth black  how did you call it  an eighth black  that's my great grandpa's black  your great grandfather's black  your great grandma's happy  white is kind 
[02:17:30]  but yeah  let me take a look  white is kind of black  let's take a look at you  under the lights  get over here  do you fill that out  on the college application  and stuff  it doesn't count  i don't make the  what part of you is black  yeah you don't look uh  i don't know  it's mixed  i don't think  wow that's  that's a great grandfather black  yeah  so your your grandfather's father or your grandmother's father  my grandpa's grandfather  so your grandfather's father was black  my grandma's father yeah it gets hard 
[02:18:00]  wait your grandma's  my grandma's father yeah  father  that's what it was  was black  so your great grandmother was a size queen  tired of small colonial dicks  oh yeah  basically  wanted some of that  look when all the way may was  taking black cock  all the way may  she knew her not to get pregnant  that's by the way may only took in the shitter  or at least fix it  fix it with an old louisville slugger  you know what this means  you lost the abdomen  penny marshall with a bat 
[02:18:30]  to hang on to the other  you know what this means right  sam is so black  oh yeah  if she has a little black in you  stop with the argument  that you're not black  you could use the n-word on the show  with impunity  oh absolutely  that's how black you are  what you do is one  sam give us one  no no no i won't do that  just give us one  no i've got to  that's the rules  if you're black you're allowed to say the n-word  so do it  i want to represent the community properly  if i'm going to represent the community  well then do it with the igga thing  i can't do that  that's not proper  why that's safe  it is 
[02:19:00]  no it's not safe  you're not going to freak me  it certainly is safe  i can't do this  alright who's the executive intern now ant  we got all sorts of issues here  david's out  do we give it to the girl  or do we give it to paul now  well i gotta give it to the girl i guess  alright  you're an executive intern  yeah  i'll  i mean show a little cleavage  i've transcended some of my racism  even though she's you know  whiter than i can't  it's amazing right  what is that  how does that happen  jesus  that's a little weird  i have to accept this under protest 
[02:19:30]  why  you still think david should be  we don't live in that corporate world  not even the corporate world  i think even more than ever now  no disrespect to her  but more than ever  yeah  i think david has cemented his position  as executive intern  he's not fucking  hobnobbing around with a cute girl  he's carry this shit  me and my book are heading out  she's just unbuttoned a button  jimmy  she knows how to play  one button  what is that  she knows how to play  back in the game  yeah  she's yeah 
[02:20:00]  see she heard you saying something  unbuttoned a button  there you go  i'll take the uh  i'll take the um negro over the jew  wow  wow  that's how i'm judging this  david you're out for a while man  i don't know what to tell you  you're  you  you disappointed me man  she's fucking struggling down the hall  with this huge band  and david goes  ah we all gotta carry  if david had something  that looked like  he was actually carrying something  then maybe  i hear you have another problem  with sam today  yes that is true 
[02:20:30]  i hear sam and david  had a falling out today  no  because they're  all this going down  they're what i call  asshole buddies  yeah  this all went down  the last like five minutes  of the other show  what happened  david what happened  oh  you should be happy  the penthouse girls  are coming in today  the one girl  likes to  to hook up with an intern  when she's here  that's what she likes to do  correct  so what's the problem  she's psyched  i was psyched for them  they're both coming  right so what's the problem  the problem is that  at the end of the 
[02:21:00]  over at cbs  at the end of the show  when i was standing up  doing something else  and i was not looking  my jacket was sitting  on a chair  and sam over here  proceeded to spray  liquid a  all over my jacket  when i wasn't looking  yes you can say liquid ass  liquid ass  yes when i wasn't looking  liquid ass has made itself  back  has brought itself back  he did not question me  and say is it okay  if i spray liquid ass  on your jacket  or i'm going to do it  he did it when i wasn't  looking  she won't even notice man 
[02:21:30]  what's that  is that what you're worried  about  i am no  she ain't gonna worry  no one's gonna know  now because i left  the jacket over at cbs  i didn't bring it here  well i just  stump brain just called  steve and said  if somebody doesn't come  get david's shit  out of this office  i'm throwing it in the  garbage  and that's an expensive  jacket  yeah  here's um  do i have to go back  there and get it  yeah you do  a text that's coming in  um uh opie from what  you said before  ladies first  this coming from the guy  who makes his wife uh  freeze  watch him pick his nose  carry the heavy part of 
[02:22:00]  the christmas tree  etc etc etc  don't forget the one i  told today  yes yes  the gas story  the gas and  i'm thinking it was  sitting before in a van  shit hoodies  shit hoodies  good old shit hoodies  oh my god  good point you know  what can i tell you  by the way because i  know how this radio  voodoo works you were  okay with everything we  were just doing on the  air  yeah  female intern  oh yeah definitely  all right i just wanted 
[02:22:30]  to get that out  all right it's fine  i've been doing radio  long enough to  understand how things  get twisted but we  were just having fun  with you and you were  cool with everything  oh yeah definitely  thank you  you make our lives  very easy by just  saying that trust me  what happens if i say  no do i get money  we all masturbate  you don't get money  next thing you know  this stupid hr department  gets their their their  their fucking hands  involved in our show  they want to have  meetings what was said  what was done  who was it right  it's all on the air  if anyone houses you  off the air 
[02:23:00]  pinches your ass  or something like  that you know  then there's a  problem right  right  smack on your ass  trust me i just  saved us probably  six hours of of of  problems meetings  yeah just because  these dopes think  they know what  radio is all about  all right uh so  david you're not  happy with sam  no you want to  have it out with  sam a little bit  are you guys  through you think  go get him  i don't know i'm  wondering if anyone's  going to get the  jacket someone has to  go get it i think  i agree david you  want to dictate that  oh no i can't  that's right  that's right jimmy  i appreciate you 
[02:23:30]  though jimmy you  showed up for me  sure did that was  very nice of you  the executive  he's been on a  i can't do i can't  i think i have to  get it myself i can't  designate he's been  on a self-destructive  journey he's isolated  his friendship with  kenny he's not  friends with kenny  anymore why are you  friends with kenny  kenny loves you  kenny buys you  breakfast every morning  but not anymore  no what happened  kenny there's a  falling out here comes  kenny you two are  like two peas in a  pod uh-oh  two jays in a pod  look at david just  shaking his head  looking at the  ground why are you 
[02:24:00]  doing this sam why  what's that about  david david's crashing  and burning what  happened when you and  david well wednesday i  delegated a specific  task to david and he  failed to complete that  task what was it  oh he was supposed to  when your coffee pot  lights up in the  morning pour your  coffee and within the  five minutes it took  for the coffee to  percolate david forgot  all about it and just  decided to go on the  internet and oh no 
[02:24:30]  whatever you look at  oh boy oh well maybe  kenny i gotta say maybe  david did forget but  perhaps he was doing  some kind of show prep  and he got carried away  and you can't fault the  man for working hard for  the radio program and  forgetting something like  that james let's not be  confused here nothing is  more important than gh when  it comes to his coffee  fair enough i don't even  disagree i was wondering  why i had a bad show  wednesday it all started  with the coffee oh david  coffee was bad it threw me  off that's that's that'll 
[02:25:00]  do it and then sam was  trying to get david to  apologize to me and  reconcile right and for  whatever reason david is  refusing to reconcile why  won't you like try to get  nice with kenny yeah i  apologize i'm not mad i'm  just hurt like right away  right away when he told  me that i forgot to do  and i realized that i  forgot to do like 10  times i said oh man i  forgot i did i'm sorry i  apologize yeah like right  away i did but now you  don't like kenny i did  apologize right away but  you don't like him i  never said i don't like 
[02:25:30]  him and then in turn you  stopped buying him  breakfast he didn't talk  to me all day today i  did not like him i  apologized confused oh  boy all right and now  what's the problem with  sam he and now he's  accusing me of things  which there's no real  evidence of yeah  you know nobody saw  me pour liquid ass on  his jacket maybe his  jacket just happens to  smell like shit that is  not the case at all no  it didn't smell like that  when i came here this  morning no you're very  disappointed with sam  huh david speak your 
[02:26:00]  mind well well according  to sam it wasn't him i  don't know if you  believe sam then some  someone else is at fault  yeah so i believe it  was sam because sam is  the only one that has  access to the little  bottle of liquid ass  he's the keeper of the  liquid ass he certainly is  the keeper yes  no one else he's the  keeper and what's that  about no one else has  allowed that the liquid  ass sam well i mean i  just kind of wanted to  fall into the wrong  hand exactly you gave me  that responsibility of  making sure it didn't fall 
[02:26:30]  into the wrong hand you  said sam make sure this  doesn't fall into the wrong  hand nice all right so  anyone anybody but anybody  out there want to smell the  liquid ass you've heard  about it you want to smell  it who wants in david once  you work the crowd with the  liquid ass ask who wants to  smell it okay that's what  that's what you say that's  what i'll do okay oh well is  it okay with the executive uh  oh okay you want david to do  that i i think david should  maybe apologize to sam for  accusing him oh that's a  good idea why should i  apologize to sam he's 
[02:27:00]  poured the liquid ass on my  jacket i don't need to  apologize you've got a  problem with authority  david that's the big thing  here i'm apologizing for  i'm apologizing for  something that someone else  did to my jacket if uh  yes paul if i could  interject one second  there was also a slight  incident with kenny last  week when kenny asked  david to go get you know  their daily muffins as  he's you know usually  buys them breakfast and  david looked at him said  well kenny why don't you  just go and get the  muffins i'm sure not 
[02:27:30]  without reason david why  would you tell yeah  to go get the muffins i  told him because he was  on his way out already to  see to move uh to  move anthony's car to his  parking garage so when he  was already going to  absolutely when he was  already going to do that i  just said well if you're  out already why don't you  just go get him because  he's done that in the past  when he's gone out to  move very logical he's  gone in the past and got  this muffins while the  task doer is out doing a  task throw one more i  completely agree yes  correct i didn't see that  was a problem at all you're  right all right hey uh  people want to know if 
[02:28:00]  dave's uh david's allowed  to work the crowd still  he's not the executive  intern anymore that's true  am i but david does good  do a good job at that so  he could do he could do  that that's something a  lowly intern would do we  might not have time for  your bit today david well  you want me to go out  there and have something  about the liquid a yeah we  could at least do that  real fast  i'm trying to get your  religion against your  religion i'm trying to ask  them who wants to smell just  who wants to smell the  liquid ass yeah well don't  squirt on anyone who would  want to be squirted with it 
[02:28:30]  no you no don't squirt  nobody you take the cap off  and they get a little sniff  of the liquid ass  okay it doesn't work out of  the bottle like that it's  gotta be on some remember  it needs to be exposed to  the air you put it on like a  shirt sleeve yes  and you want me to report  back to you on what the  reactions were david uh i want  you to uh put a little on  your shirt sleeve because  that's the best way to smell  the liquid ass don't worry  david i just put a pinch on  a little pinch and then you  want me to report on what  people's reactions were yes  no then you work the crowd  and go who wants to smell  the liquid ass and when  they raise their hand like 
[02:29:00]  oh me me because everybody  wants to then they smell  your sleeve  right you want to know what  the reactions are yes we'll  get the reaction because  you're gonna have a  microphone okay just a  pinch sam yeah just a  pinch a lot a pinch between  your cheek and gum sam just  the pinch right just to get  your sleeve now i agree that  david uh okay sam just do  it david i actually  oh my what happened the  bottle is broken yeah the  bottle must be broke david  what happened if that's the 
[02:29:30]  case i'm not going to do it  i wasn't forewarned about  this no huh but you have it  on you so you might as well  now yeah now you know how  bad is the smell take ass and  make ass aid how bad is the  smell it's on the sleeve it's  on the sleeve there you go  all right does it smell bad  yes it does it smells really  really all right now go and  work the crowd oh is that  his ass jacket oh no look  who it is don't wreck his  jacket that wouldn't be  oh what's the matter look  who it is what do you mean  look who it is joe brings  the jacket uh-oh joe has  his own issues you have a  problem with joe well no i  just have a problem with  someone bringing the jacket  back anyone you gotta be

[02:40:30]  you can beat me up  if you want  no but it  it wasn't fair  i mean usually  we beat the shit  out of people  we you know  have a problem with  that's okay honey  you ended up doing  like backwards  flips into guys  faces  and yeah  it was amazing  it was amazing  shit you were doing  for everybody  and then our good  friend uh  brett michaels  comes in  and goes  this teya chick  is you know  is the real deal  she's awesome  aww did he say  nice things about me  absolutely he did  aww how sweet  and you were  are you still  on the show  yeah i'm still 
[02:41:00]  on the show  right now  yeah  see i haven't  watched the show  yet  five episodes in  okay  and were you doing  the drinking  out of the puss  or  oh  why does  everybody think  i don't know  because i haven't  seen it yet  and i'm like that  i wasn't even  anywhere near that  when it was going  on it was two  blondes  i don't understand  how it could have  possibly been  confusing to me  everyone is saying  that you were part  of that  absolutely not  never in a million  years  were you just  pouring the liquid  nothing  i wasn't even near  it it was two  blondes that's why  i'm kind of confused  about the confusion  because i'm clearly 
[02:41:30]  not a blonde  so i don't  understand why  everybody thought  that was me  from your show  you know what  it's okay  i mean anytime  i'm involved  in controversy  especially if it's  not true  i'm all about that  right on  okay  spread of a big  penis  i'm not gay at all  i happen to like  him a lot  and he comes in a lot  and this is where  he's a big penis  have you seen his  penis  i have not  come on  you need to  catch a glimpse  of it by accident  catch a glimpse  i mean it's  he's got quite a  manly bulge  down there  he's a rock star 
[02:42:00]  he looks like  he's hung  perfectly well  nah they  do a little  padding or  something  probably  i have bruce  dickinson as a  huge penis  from iron maiden  because he was  always the  iron maiden  poster  all right  we're like  this is just  weird  jimmy just likes  talking about  men's penis  that's not true  at all  i was trying to  get the girls  all riled up  we have got to  turn this  conversation around  immediately  you brought  your friend  shauna today  i did  isn't she cute  now you guys  fought it out  for pet of the  year  we didn't fight  it out  we loved it  out  you technically  lost to

[03:11:30]  have a  perspective  on what's  going on  in my  life right  now  and what's  going on  in my  life right  now  is that  i never  want to  do  radio  again  because i  do not  want to  do  for this  can i  ask you  something  this is  not even  about this  is there  something  going on  with you  because you  seem  that you  get upset  like is  there something  going on  in your  personal life  for something  or is  this just  your nature  because  on every  almost every  trip you  break down  at one point  and stuff  and i'm like  is something  bothering you  i get homesick 
[03:12:00]  i want to  go home  like i don't  like being  away from  home  you told me  you wanted  to come here  i did  but you know  i thought  every time  i go somewhere  i think  i can do it  and apparently  i'm not good  at what i am  you are  you're great  but you don't  this shit's  just making me  sad now  no kidding  she turned  me  I'll admit it  some other  girls don't  get shit  sometimes  it's not  just you  yeah but  i don't  want to go  i'm not  going to  set myself  up to  fine and  you walked  off and  you walked 
[03:12:30]  off and  that's fine  i've had  girls walk  off shows  it's okay  all right  she wants  to be home  it'll make  her feel good  she hates  being away  from home  it's so  fine  whatever it's  done i  don't give  a fuck  about any  person in  this building  all right  now  yeah  bitch  you had  us  not today  moving forward  i do not  want to go  on a new  radio  man i don't  know how  ronnie's  going to do  a show  with feds  acting like  this today  oh god  i'm sorry 
[03:13:00]  for ronnie  you know do  you not think  that a lot  of girls  have to go  through this  although it's  part of the  no i don't  want to go  through it  so i'm  not  i've been  getting out  for a while  so whatever  so you know  maybe you  should  maybe you  should  after this  tour  i'm serious  maybe you  should take  a break  i'm talking  to you as  a friend  not as  your publicist  i think  you should  maybe take  a break  not even  taking a break  i'm fucking  done with  everybody  everything i  said  you seem  very upset  yeah i am  upset because  everything i  said came  back and  kicked me

[03:24:30]  what do you think  you're going to say  hi I'm on the cover  and anybody's going to  give a shit  but I think that was  part of the problem  is you know  she wanted to promote  the paper thing  and there was the old  internet  yeah but you know what  oh jesus  I was also talking  oh god damn you  danny  that's hot  she wouldn't like  this one  wow  we were talking about  the fucking pen  she did a penthouse video  that's all part of  penthouse  what's the fucking  problem  shut up  I'm watching the video  oh sorry  yeah  all right  why don't we get  it then  uh  laney's got to  get her out of  here  cause uh  yeah  oh boy  laney's very good  we like laney a lot 
[03:25:00]  very much  she does a lot  for this radio show  she knows how to  find him  that's for sure  oh a little slap  oh boy  wow  now she won't even  go to the site  it's accommodating  why is she doing  this then  well  well I think  like I was telling  I'm not even talking  about the porn  cause she might have  moved on from this  who knows  but why is she even  in a magazine  naked  if she's like  this sensitive  about everything  well I don't  I think honestly  I think she's just  like I was telling 
[03:25:30]  Anthony  I think she's  you know  she's going  and doing these  radio shows  right now  promoting her issue  and the fact  that she just  you know  won pet of the year  runner up  and so I think  that maybe she just  I mean I don't know  I don't  I haven't really  talked to her  about this  I'm kind of just  an observer myself  but I think  that maybe  she just thought  it was going  to be more  talking about  you know  what she's  I don't know  I'm just trying  to help  let me play  devil's advocate  yeah  okay so  alright  never 
[03:26:00]  you have lips  you ought to  stand on your  medication  let me ask  okay here's  how we do it  you were on  the cover of  Panos right  yes sir  let's talk  about that  for real  not rock of love  not any of it  let's talk  about the magazine  about  what about it  what do you want  to know about it  okay I don't know  I was already here  promoting my  I mean I'm  give me a fucking  answer  I don't know  what to say  I tried to salvage  this situation  even her magazine  let's promote her  magazine  this is  I'm only saying 
[03:26:30]  this because  no no no  I totally agree  with what you're  saying  I totally get  what you're  saying  I just think  that maybe  she got upset  because  I plugged  her fucking  fuck shake  man you're  amateur  I plugged  the listener  I plugged  the signing  we plugged  the fucking  I plugged  the video  because it  says penthouse  on it  and we  plugged  the magazine  and it said  she was smoking  in it  it's like  you're right  you're right  what the fuck  do you want  not you  but what do you  want from a radio  show  you don't just  walk on and go  hi I'm hot  and fucking  people give a fuck  in their cars  nobody cares  we were being  really were  being nice  you guys were 
[03:27:00]  being nice  you guys  we liked our  was mean to me  last time  and I still stayed  holy mackerel  maybe she's mad  because she's never  recovered from that  she's coming out  okay she's coming  out  get them off  the screen  why fucker  I'm running  angry  fucker  put on the  audience monitor  Danny put on  the audience monitor  supposedly she  rode Howard's  fuck machine  yesterday too  it's like  hello  shut up  oh really  really 
[03:27:30]  don't you  that's what I'm  hearing  a ton of  thanks for listening  to us  instead of Howard  by the way  you asses  that give me  the info  everybody boo  boo hoo  boo hoo  bye  bye  I hope  everything works  out okay  if you need a  little mermaid  room to stay  in I know  where there is  one  where's she now 
[03:28:00]  holy fuck  it's amazing  that doesn't  make her cry  there's a giant  penis in her  hiney  it looks like  the fucking  it looks like  the fucking  titanic  going into the  lincoln  speaking of  lincoln  I know  that video 
[03:28:30]  makes you  realize the  mistake  she was  making out  with some  broad on  Howard's  show  yesterday  what's up  steve  was she upset  after yesterday's  show that  she did  Lainey was  very apologetic  first of all  because Lainey  has we have  extensive  conversations  before the  girls ever  come on  they know  exactly what  they're walking  into  they do  she actually  gives us  a breakdown  of every show  we're going to  do and what  is to be  expected on the  show  I know 
[03:29:00]  Taya's last  appearance was  fucking huge  it's all over  the god damn  internet now  and it went  perfectly  and Lainey's  baffled by this  and she's very  apologetic  because she  wasn't expecting  this  I think it  actually says  I actually have  my paper in  there that  breaks down  what the show  is  and she said  it's a dude  show  it's guys  being guys  and they're  going to  kind of  be raunchy  so we  definitely  know  everything  we're walking  into  every time  we go  on to  every show  because Lainey  is very 
[03:29:30]  thorough about  that kind  of thing  I hope he's  having an  episode  for somebody  who wanted  to be a  porn actress  since she  was 12  and that's  8 years  ago  I don't buy  the fucking  self-centered  horse shit  that was  fucking  nonsense  and it  was  irritating  all she's  thought about  in her life  is cock  so god forbid  we talk  about it  a little bit  because I  don't like  that fucking  bullshit  you're so 
[03:30:00]  sweet and  so nice  I like  nice Jimmy  so when  somebody is  being a  fucking  phony  or a  head case  they gotta  be called  out  is she  out of  the building  yeah  she's  downstairs  having a  smoke  oh good  okay  she should  think about  cancer  no I don't  have to deal  about it  maybe she's  jonesing or  something  because there's  yesterday  her riding  the fucking  big smile  on her face  where are the  fucking tears  we should have  showed her that  exactly  how is that  promoting 
[03:30:30]  the fucking  spread  being on a  mechanical bull  is it true  she wants  I honestly  just met her  a couple weeks  ago  I don't  have any idea  pass that buck  I like that  she's running  away crying  those cockadile  tears  now that  she's gone  I'll make  a goof  I thought  I had a  shot  I know  I think  it's funny  too  and you're  not red  when you're  joke bombed  Anthony actually  got a little  red  Anthony never 
[03:31:00]  gives a shit  none of us  care if our  jokes  no  oh you know  what it was  when someone  said shot  you did like  a shot  a load  joke  yes  and that  might have  been  I was like  oh yeah  the shot  a load  joke  and yeah  and then I  kind of  spelled out  how the  movies work  where it's  you know  that  and then the  blowjob  and then the  come in the  face  and it was  like you know  I could see  then she was  just kind of  like eh  once I saw  the eyes  welling up  I just  stepped back  and left it  to the  fucking  two destroyers  to move in  for the kill  I usually  don't do that  I'm the  picador 
[03:31:30]  I go in there  and just  stick a few  swords in  you guys  are the  managers  I gotta slightly  defend myself  I was ready  to destroy her  and Jimmy and I  both felt at the  same time  when she goes  I'm homesick  then I was  done  I'm like  alright  let's leave  my walk  and then she  went right back  to trash  us  I'm like  you know  fuck it  then I got  annoyed  but I found  out that she  was on our  show doing  stuff  it's terrible  isn't it  it's terrible  tragic  if you're on  one show  doing stuff  and then we're  actually not  being dicks  open the window  so we could  yell at her  on the street  oh my god 
[03:32:00]  and then we  could throw  some mustard  on her too  I want to  lay her down  and put a  door with rocks  on it  on her  like in  Crowhaven Farm  I knew it  nobody saw  that movie  but me  I want to  punish the  heretic  I know  went over  everybody's head  including the  people who  were in  Crowhaven Farm  it scared me  when I was  a boy  I made  wee wee  in my  tough skins  I want to  thank  I want to  thank Taya  for wrecking  the show  today 
[03:32:30]  because we're  going to have  to leave  now  Taya was  very nice  today  go see Taya  go to the  signing  just to support  Taya Parker  you'll love her  she's fucking  really  she's great  and she's on  rock of love  bus  the only one's  hotter  but Taya rules  so you should  honestly don't  think so  I think Taya  I'm much more  attracted to Taya  oh thank you  I might even  seriously  I mean  she's a pretty  girl  but  Taya  you're  yes  that's okay  I'm not for  everybody  that's why  you beat her  hands out  you humiliated her  in the fucking  penthouse of the 
[03:33:00]  year thing  they only gave her  a second to be  polite  she actually came  in 11th in the  voting  I know  the Guccione's  faxed me  oh wow  you should have  well you can come  see me at the  romantic depot  noon to two  is that a porn  place  New Jersey  um yeah  it's like a  it's Paramus  by the way  don't say Paramus  yeah  anymore  this is not  Manhattan  I'm sorry  I don't know  I've not heard  of it until now  Manhattan  damn Manhattan  so  so what are you

[03:34:30]  information  what  share  I can't  just tell her  what you're watching  that you enjoyed  come on  there was one part  he fucking  wouldn't stop  talking about  tell her  it was the part  where the girls  got really drunk  and made out  with each other  and it was just  very impressive  which time  which time  well you know  that's what I was  talking about  what  tell her which time  I wasn't making out  with any girls  he's not talking  about me  no no but wait  until the time  the thing with you  that you said  tell come on  this is fucking  sad  the part with the dog  what  the part with the dog 
[03:35:00]  what are you talking  about  why are you shy  now  tell her  don't be shy  it's on TV  everyone has seen it  I know  that's what I'm  trying to tell him  I have no pride  anymore  go ahead  what is it  tell her  it's the part  with the  what  the oven mitts  and the dog  the parts  with the oven mitts  and the dog  what are you talking  about  what  what are you talking  about  it's just  an improv thing  yeah I know  they're trying to 
[03:35:30]  no but I tell her  he's trying to get me  to admit to something  like  no no I'm not  he's uh  he's just being shy  because I'm like  you gotta tell her  that thing you were  telling us  he's like  well she'll get  really mad at me  I want  listen I don't get  mad if it's on TV  listen my life  is an open book  you can ask me  about anything you  want and I will  be honest  of course  have you ever  taken it in the  shitter  I have not  okay  I think you told  us that last time  were you the one  that fell off the  stage  I am the one  that fell off the  stage  I am  she was doing  a roadie thing  and it was hysterical  she was crying 
[03:36:00]  a little bit  but you know what  she was a trooper  and then she got  back up there  and started doing  more of that roadie  I started crying  after I fell  because I really  I actually fell  off a six foot  stage on my back  you're all a  bunch of cry babies  no I wasn't  like me when  spaghetti hits the  wall  I think I did  a really good job  actually  yeah  Steve what was  the thing you  were going to  ask me  don't try to  skirt out of  here  come on  cough it up  cough it up  it'll be white  viscous  and salty  are you implying  that I'm homosexual  yes  just tell me 
[03:36:30]  honestly I'm not  she's fine Steve  I told you  she's very cool  she thinks you're  really uptight  for some reason  there's no way  she's uptight  I know  you're not  I might play  uptight on TV  I don't know  it just seems like  the other girls  just have kind of  a toot about you  they don't like you  a whole lot  that's okay  I wouldn't go on  there expecting  to be liked  especially when you  go on a show  trying to date  a long star  it just seems like  the other girls  are kind of  bitchy about you  they are  and they should be  and why  I mean probably 
[03:37:00]  just because  I mean I went  into a show  to date  a rock star  and last time  I checked my  record books  like rock stars  and centerfolds  work out pretty  well  so I think  they thought  hey  she might  you know  have trumped me  already  in the beginning  so  you know what I mean  I mean  I didn't expect  to make friends  I honestly didn't  I expected there  to be a lot  of hating  going on  so  you know  they directed it  at me  and that was fine  I told you  she wouldn't care  so tell her  the incident  tell her  go ahead  go ahead 
[03:37:30]  you were fucking  raving about it  you said that  you thought  she was a little  fucked up  there's nothing  on your blackberry  he thought you  were wrong  no tell me  tell her  and you know what  I might have  an explanation  it might have  been an editing  situation  trust me  I've watched it  and there's a lot  of effed up  editing going on  yeah I know  that's why I try  to tell him  he's like no  she's fucked up  no I'm really  not  go ahead  well you know  it had to do  with a lot of  booze  you know  exactly  boo  booze  I knew that was  what is he  talking about  Steve please  come on  you gotta go  you can't just  you know 
[03:38:00]  infer  because then  people that are  listening are like  what's going on  maybe she is effed up  you have to at least  give me a chance  well what about  that one incident  with that chick  that was really  really pissed off  at you that one time  what  be more specific  I have no idea  what you're talking  about  you're talking  in circles  Steven  he is  I have no idea  it's called shitty  improv  I wanna go home  so is that  I wanna go home  Steve come on  Steve what is going on  come on  give me a chance  to at least defend  myself if you think  I did something wrong  go ahead  you know 
[03:38:30]  the incident  with the  what's that blonde  chick's name  don't help her  Jane Mansfield  who had better  improv skills  there's like 20  blondes on there  I know  I don't know  you have to tell me  what you're talking  about  you know who she is  don't ask her  to admit it  you know  I don't know  you were talking  about it all  fucking week  was I  I'm sorry Jim  I'm having a lapse  Steve this is like  really sucky  tell me what you're  talking about  did Shauna call  a bellhop  to bring all  her baggage  out with her  could be a couple 
[03:39:00]  of trips  well obviously  see Steve's  not even letting  me defend myself  as soon as you  leave he'll start  talking about it  I know  and that's what  makes me upset  because then I  won't be able to  defend myself  once I'm gone  yes  I tell you Parker  that you're  another terrific  performance  a little different  this time around  but it was great  yes we are fans  she's fucking so hot  and you can see her  on a rock  a love bus  Brett's a great  guest when he comes  in  and you can also  see her today  in Paramus
