<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton introducing themselves and setting the tone with their characteristically unrestrained style.  They initially mocked Harold Camping's failed end-of-the-world predictions, both the May and October dates.  This segued into a somber discussion about the devastating tornado in Joplin, Missouri, reacting to graphic footage and audio of the event.  The mood shifted abruptly to crude jokes about the attractiveness of female news anchors, followed by a discussion of masturbation techniques.  They then circled back to Camping, focusing on his apologies and the financial aspects of his doomsday operation.

The show then covered an IMF official accused of sexual assault, with a graphic description of the New York Post's depiction of the alleged victim's family.  Oprah's final show and Beyonce's performance were briefly criticized, specifically targeting Beyonce's message of female empowerment. The hosts also discussed athletes, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and a Canadian man making videos of himself firing automatic weapons (initially mistaken for a Russian).  A segment followed featuring a debate, potentially with studio guest Jimmy, sparked by ESPN's top 50 athletes of the 20th century list.  The ranking of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Muhammad Ali, Wayne Gretzky, Babe Ruth, Jim Thorpe, and Jesse Owens (and his race against a horse) drew particular ire, along with discussions about Kobe Bryant, Bo Jackson, and the general absurdity of comparing athletes across different sports.  This segment also included complaints about difficulties accessing their own show, "The Virus," on SiriusXM, citing listener frustration with channel changes and poor customer service.  They briefly criticized Bono's Billboard Music Awards speech and discussed a planned advertising campaign they disagreed with.  The segment also included an anecdote about listening to 1940s music. Jimmy Fallon was mentioned as a scheduled guest.

Anthony then recounted his high-speed stock car driving experience at Pocono Raceway, detailing the process, the speed (reaching approximately 170 mph), and the G-forces involved,  also describing driving his modified Shelby Mustang.  The conversation broadened to other adrenaline-inducing activities like skydiving and comparing the experience to video games and Brian Johnson's book. Jimmy Fallon called in, discussing his upcoming appearance, a problematic sweater he once wore,  the dangers of impulsive tweeting (including Anthony's ban from a pizzeria), and New York City pizza places.  Anthony also shared a funny story about performing with Paul McCartney and the Bee Gees on Saturday Night Live.  The segment concluded with promotional announcements for other SiriusXM programming, including a Kevin Smith and Scott Moser podcast and a Mitch Hedberg show.

Numerous commercial breaks punctuated a segment featuring a pre-recorded interview with Kim Kardashian.  The hosts discussed Jimmy Fallon, praising his work ethic and recounting an airport encounter.  They also shared their opinions on various 80s bands (The Cars, Devo, Elvis Costello) and discussed a Sam Roberts and 50 Cent video.  Upcoming guests (Brian Johnson, Malcolm McDowell, Paris Hilton) were announced, along with Jim Norton's stand-up shows.  Jim Norton also requested a YouTube video be taken down to protect his family and discussed his child's habits and the challenges of parenthood, including an anecdote about his father's diarrhea.

The show concluded with a discussion about the advantages of remote work and podcasts, alongside a vulgar and graphic segment involving a "baby diaper mustache" challenge, which ended abruptly. No further guests were mentioned in this final segment. The entire broadcast aired on SiriusXM.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on?  Live now? Is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment.  And having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  No telling. What are we going to hear in here today?  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  That would be cool.  Good morning. Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody.  Hi.  Man, this end of the world thing is a little weird  with Joplin and then this volcano.  Yeah.  Erupted again, huh?  But if you take out the end of the world thing,  we'd be like, oh, there's tornadoes and some volcanoes.  Good point. 
[00:01:30]  Some volcanoes.  Yeah, but that head muckety-muck guy  that was saying that the end of the world was...  A fraud?  Yeah.  Did he admit it's a fraud?  No, no.  He says now it's October 21st.  Oh.  He recalculated.  He said that Jesus did come down  and, you know, start his work,  but he can't finish everything in a day and stuff.  Why? He's Jesus.  He had to spec the job out first.  And he looked at it. 
[00:02:00]  You know, he's got to get materials, I guess,  and maybe get an advance.  So...  And then on the 21st of October now  is the new day for...  Or the 24th is it?  I have no idea.  But it's October somethingth.  October 21st.  21st.  Yeah.  Is...  That's the new end of the world.  So are people now telling this guy  to shut the fuck up  or are they going to buy into this  and we have to wait another six months?  I'm sure crazy people are completely buying it.  This guy, though,  is just milking this for all it's fucking worth 
[00:02:30]  because he saw all the publicity they got.  He was sending a bunch of people  to that dumb website, whatever it is.  Yep.  Who cares?  I won't promote it.  I'm not on this.  Not on these are words.  Very good, sir.  Very good.  But he saw, you know,  probably got a shitload of hits  and decided,  ah, let me carry this out.  He teased the end of the world.  And got away with it.  He did a tease  on the end of the world  and got away with it.  Sounds like a nice radio promotion.  You promote, you promote, 
[00:03:00]  you promote, you promote,  you promote,  and then it's a bust in the end  because it was never a good promotion.  End of the world.  May 21st.  End of the world, everybody.  May 21st rolls around.  It's like,  did we get to the end of the world?  Ah, shit.  You know,  we're going to do it next break.  We're going to do it next break.  I swear,  it's October 21st.  We're absolutely getting  to the end of the world.  Sponsored by,  I hate Steven Singer.  Jesus,  we got a word,  he's stuck in traffic,  but he will be in  on October 21st. 
[00:03:30]  What's his name?  Harold Camping, I think.  Harold Camping.  Here's the official,  Harold Camping's a doof.  Here's the official,  this is why the world  didn't end on May 21st.  We were convinced  that on May 21,  God would return here  in a very physical way.  That is,  God,  do I hate this guy's voice?  We were convinced  that on May 21,  God would return. 
[00:04:00]  So we were expecting,  you know,  it's God  coming back  after all these years.  Silly us  expecting a little  hoopla,  a little fucking  pandemonium,  and nothing happened,  but I guess  he's got an excuse.  Yeah.  Were you out and about  on Saturday?  Dude,  I was fucking  racing cars.  You weren't out and about,  and I want to talk about that  because I didn't hear you  recap that yesterday.  But wherever I went  on Saturday, 
[00:04:30]  everybody was joking about that.  No, they were joking  about it at the track.  Okay, they were.  Yeah, yeah.  Joking about this.  This guy's a clown.  Yeah, total goof.  That is,  by bringing a great earthquake  and by ushering in  the final five months  of the Day of Judgment,  and the fact is  when we look at it  spiritually,  then we find  he did come.  He did come.  Oh.  Now let me back up. 
[00:05:00]  The fact is,  you're going to find out  that I'm going to be saying  there's not a new date.  There's not a new date.  We've already been talking  again and again  about the end of the world  being October 21  in 2011.  October 21.  But we have not emphasized that  because the first down payment  or the beginning of it  was the fact that 
[00:05:30]  we would see  all of these things happening  and usher into  a five-month period  of very, very terrible time.  You know what this is?  What is this?  I get it now.  I get it now.  It's like when you go to a concert  and the band doesn't open  with a hit.  You're like,  you know,  why are you opening with this?  So everyone sits there  and kind of,  but this guy's saying,  you know,  God didn't open big,  but that encore  is going to be  a motherfucker.  That's exactly what it is. 
[00:06:00]  I think this guy's scrambling.  Of course he is.  With that voice of his.  Dummy.  Oh, so he said it happened.  What about the Joplin thing?  That's the finger of God.  So that's not all of God.  It's just the finger of God.  Wait a minute.  Finger of God.  My fork.  I dropped my fork.  Shit.  Finger of God.  Plang, plang, plang.  Is there an F5?  Yeah.  F4 will relocate your house  pretty efficiently.  Is there an F5? 
[00:06:30]  Bleh.  Yeah.  They all look at each other like,  why did she ask that?  Why?  Oh, geez.  You're not even supposed  to say F5.  Oh, that's terrible.  I'm embarrassed for that line.  It's so bad.  So bad.  But was that a finger of God?  Was that an F5 that hit Joplin?  What do you think?  It looked like it.  And from some of the sounds  from a video, wow.  I didn't hear the sounds yet.  Oh, that thing is insane. 
[00:07:00]  Really?  Does it sound like a train?  No.  No, it sounds like Cloverfield.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It sounds like a soundtrack  to a movie.  The guy has a video.  We drive this direction.  But I guess, you know,  obviously the lights are out  in the place  and it's so dark  from the clouds.  You see some lightning  through the window  every so often  and some very dark light  through the window.  they're being safe at first.  They're in a store 
[00:07:30]  and there's some kids in there  and they're upset  and they kind of are taking  some kind of shelter.  They're getting on the floor  and stuff.  But then,  about a minute and 30 in,  the shit starts hitting the fan.  Uh-oh.  And motherfucker,  it sounds horrific.  They're praying to God.  They're telling each other  they love each other.  They thought they were dead.  Poop.  Now, big flashes of lightning  are starting to come through. 
[00:08:00]  As we wait for the action,  who are the assholes  that dislike a video like this?  I saw that too.  I was thinking the same thing.  YouTube's got to wake up  and if you dislike a video like this,  just get rid of these people.  There's about a million  and a half views on this.  3,059 likes  and 106.1 people went,  oh, real footage  and audio during a tornado.  Fuck that.  I don't like it.  Just a bunch of assholes.  The guy, like,  didn't even get good video.  It's primarily dark  for the whole thing.  What is it going to take  for those assholes?  It's very dark. 
[00:08:30]  What is it going to take  for those assholes  to like a video  if you don't like  something like this?  Like this.  This is amazing shit.  You can kind of see  they're in the store.  All the lights are out.  The power's out.  This was,  was this end of the world day?  No, this is the 22nd.  That was Sunday after.  Okay, because if this  happened on Saturday,  these people had to believe  the end of the world  was upon them.  You could start hearing  like something's going on  outside. 
[00:09:00]  Sure, sure, sure.  And they're like,  okay, they're just chatting  about safety.  What?  You hear that low rumbling?  Yeah, yeah.  And then shit starts shaking.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  We need to...  You just shake your pants.  And they're already scared.  But this is nothing.  Why aren't they running?  There's nowhere to go.  They have to stay  inside in their shelter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good job.  We're good.  We're good.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Here it comes. 
[00:10:30]  Jesus!  Jesus!  Jesus!  Jesus!  Jesus!  I love everyone.  I love everyone, man.  That's what you're saying when you're dying.  Jesus!  Jesus! Jesus!  Heavenly Father!  Thank you, Jesus!  For what?  By the way, I can see why you dislike this video. 
[00:11:00]  It's good audio.  That's what it is.  What are you gonna do?  Unfortunately, it's hard to videotape it in the middle of a tornado.  I want clean footage.  I'm okay.  I'm trying not to lay on someone.  Somebody's on my back.  A hunk will fall.  A tornado is a good time to cop a feel.  The wind blew my hand into him.  This is under me.  We're okay. We're okay.  Did it pass? 
[00:11:30]  Now they're trying to...  It's passing.  They're trying to get out.  They're all tangled up with each other and debris and glass.  Was the place destroyed?  No.  All the windows burst out.  They're not sure if the whole place is fucked up or not.  They went into one of the freezers in the store.  It's a good study in human nature because as the thing's coming, everyone's like, Jesus, I love everyone.  I love you.  And then you hear that lady, hey, something's on my back. 
[00:12:00]  Get off of me, you fucking asshole.  You fucking asshole.  Just looked at a tornado.  I don't need your shit.  Right.  What you just said.  Oh, shit.  The iPhone killer's on TV.  There it is.  Oh, dude.  Another one.  There we go.  The smallest smartphone has entered the marketplace.  Well, that's it.  It's over for Apple.  There it is.  It's over for Apple.  Look, we're bored with the video already.  They're like, be careful.  There's glass all over.  Right, right.  Yeah, but that's.  When you hear that thing rumbling in the background.  It just sucked the glass out of the building. 
[00:12:30]  And just everything just started.  What would you do?  Would you shit your pants?  No, I probably wouldn't shit my pants.  Would you fire at it hoping that would do something?  I wouldn't be saying I love you.  I love everyone because then you've got to live with that.  You never know, though.  You say crazy things, I think.  It's like George on the plane.  Right, right.  And the plane is crashing.  Man, I think we're okay.  I think we're okay.  George.  Yeah, so you know, you don't want to get into that whole thing. 
[00:13:00]  And that one woman, Jesus, Jesus, Heavenly Father.  But then I think she was the one that said, you know, someone's on my back.  Yeah.  Here's part two of Harold's camping explaining what happened on May 21st.  Oh.  Says he was wrong.  I'm willing to publicly apologize for what you've said.  I would like to publicly apologize for scaring half of you.  I'm sorry I said it was the end of the world.  I'm sorry I did that. 
[00:13:30]  It's funny he doesn't have to apologize.  No.  What the fuck?  People wasted their life savings buying advertising for this scumbag.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How many people bought into it, though?  Are there numbers out?  Because like I said, Saturday, wherever I went, people were like, well, 15 minutes before the end of the world.  Yeah, yeah.  Like really fucking joking it up.  So how many people actually bought into this?  I think a lot of people bought into it.  No.  Yeah.  People are crazy.  Where are they?  People are crazy. 
[00:14:00]  Where are those people?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hiding in shame.  In some form of shame.  How many senators?  I don't think any.  You sure?  Yeah.  I don't think any people that.  You saw a religious list, though.  Yeah, yeah.  That one senator believing that.  Oh, he probably.  Yeah, he probably.  The dinosaurs.  Remember that guy?  Probably no comment.  No.  This was his latest apology.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Very upset. 
[00:14:30]  I did so many bad things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For your mistake.  For your mistake.  I can, if people want me to apologize, I can apologize.  Yes, I did not have all of that worked out exactly as it is.  Yes.  I didn't have it right.  I wish I could have had it.  But that doesn't bother me at all.  Because I, I, I'm not a, I'm not a genius. 
[00:15:00]  Oh.  And I, I do, I pray all the time for wisdom and, and when I make them.  Well, we were kind of expecting a genius.  Yeah, yeah.  To come up with the fact that the earth is ending May 21st, 2011.  That, you would assume right off the bat, wow, that's gotta be a fucking genius.  Or at least if you're not a genius, like all your research is going into this for your  entire life.  This is the moment you've been waiting for.  You got like.  You think he'd get it right.  You think he got instruments.  He's got instruments.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Constantly checking.  Something.  Hey, uh, and somebody on the old Twitter says, why aren't they running?  LOL.  Opie, your innocence makes me a titter.  Now, if you saw a tornado in the distance or started hearing some rumblings, wouldn't you  just fucking run?  Uh, you, you think you would.  As a human being?  But it's, uh.  I know that would probably not do much.  Yes, I understand that.  It's the worst, yeah, the worst thing to do.  So what do you do?  Just.  You're supposed to seek shelter.  Hunker down?  Hunker down?  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  And in that, in that, in that neck of the woods, you're supposed to have some type of  place, you know, that you can go and be safe.  Would you run?  Like where are you going to run to?  I don't know.  You know what it looks like outside during that?  Maybe you try to find a cellar?  It's, uh.  A cellar door?  I need a fruit cellar.  Right.  It's, it's all, it's pitch black in the middle of the daytime when this is happening.  Wait, that was the middle of the day?  Uh, I'm not sure, but when, when it does happen in the daytime, it's pitch black also.  And then the lightning is striking like crazy. 
[00:16:30]  You're getting hail.  Like, you're going to run outside and, and play tornado Pac-Man?  Just trying to fucking waka waka waka waka waka, hope the thing doesn't hit you?  What if you have a shitty home as far as somewhere to go in a tornado?  That's just it.  What if you don't have a basement?  Then you're, you're fucked.  You, you gotta get into somewhere that is, uh, that you think will be secure and, and  hope that the thing zigs and, uh, you know, you're on the zag end of the, the whole thing.  Well, you're supposed to go up to the roof, right? 
[00:17:00]  Like, just take a ladder and hold on to the gutters.  Yes.  Hold on to the gutters, they say, are the safest part of a house.  So you hold on to the gutters.  You go on the roof with your brother with a big sheet.  Yes.  And you just kind of hold it and make a sail.  I would grab a big, uh, four by eight piece of plywood and hold on to it on the roof as tightly as possible.  I would fucking run, man.  That would be my instinct.  I would just be willy nilly running guy. 
[00:17:30]  I think the best thing to do is find, uh, some place if you're in a trailer, uh, you've  already resigned your fact to the risk.  And if it does hit you, um, I don't know what you're supposed to do.  But, uh, if you're in a, you know, a fortified building bricks, like the three little pigs  say, and there's a basement in there, I think you're supposed to get into that motherfucker.  All right.  It's, uh, yeah, that's gotta be insane.  I've never been through a tornado.  Fair enough, then.  I've been through a few.  You've been through a few.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  You just got, I was zipping around.  It blew me one time before town's over.  How'd you land so softly as, uh, to survive?  I was just running.  Oh, so you hit the ground running.  Just hit me.  I was like, boom.  Back on the, on the ground running.  Yeah.  Almost wrecked my nightclub.  All right.  Scandals.  And then my other one was, the first one was escapades.  Escapades and scandals.  Yeah.  My nightclub is scandals here in the city.  Seashells.  Wasn't there an escapades?  There was one on Long Island, wasn't there?  It's always a Marriott bar. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  It's named like scandals or escapades and things like that.  And you go in there and there's just fat house frows and fucking midlife crisis guys  trying to hook up.  Just trying to hook up.  Hook up with each other.  Trying to hook up, motherfucker.  Here's the second half of Harold Camping.  Explain why the earth did.  Well, he's doing a lot of fucking bobbing and weaving.  Yeah.  He should lose his radio gig over this.  Yes.  I pray all the time for wisdom. 
[00:19:00]  And, and when I make an error, then I may, I say, yes, I was wrong.  I have said that already.  Yeah.  More than several times tonight.  I was wrong.  It was to be understood spiritually, not, uh, not, uh, uh, physically, physically.  And yet the sense of it is still the same.  That judgment has come.  Die.  Your world is now under judgment where it was not prior to may 21.  Wow. 
[00:19:30]  Spiritually.  There's a big difference in the world that we can't detect it all with our eyes, but  we can know from the Bible.  Oh, that's wonderful.  So it's happening right now.  As we speak, judgment is being placed upon.  What does that mean?  Can we change the evil?  Uh, no, I think we're, we're done.  Why?  Judgment means you're there.  You're still being judged.  Yeah.  But you can't like, like the case has been done.  The final cases.  Yeah.  Case is over.  The, uh, defense and the prosecution have given their closing statements on your soul. 
[00:20:00]  Mm hmm.  And, uh, now it's just, uh, the jury's deliberating.  Oh boy.  Jesus and God, uh, uh, deliberating.  Uh, there's no change.  You can't present, uh, new evidence and stuff.  It's done you.  And I don't think there's any appeals court to this one.  Mm hmm.  So, um, on October 21st, that's it.  This is it.  This is the last one.  So on October 21st, that's when the jury comes back with their verdict.  Right.  Right.  The jury being, you know, our Lord and savior.  Uh, and, uh, if it is deemed that you are judged evil, you will, um, be left, I guess, 
[00:20:30]  upon this earth, uh, to die a horrible death.  And, uh, the good, you'll just see their clothes laying there in a pile cause they will  be, um, uh, risen up into the heavens, but sit with the heavenly father.  I don't get that because wouldn't God allow you to just come up with your clothes so you  don't look silly.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who the fuck wants to be naked in front of a bunch of strangers?  It'll make it look more dramatic to the people that are left in horror. 
[00:21:00]  Of course.  If there's just piles of clothes, you're kind of like, holy shit.  Of course.  But that seems to be a real pain.  Why, why doesn't he just take you and your clothes and then you can figure it out when  you get up there?  Yeah.  Maybe, maybe then you're in line and they, and then they tell you to take your clothes  off and get your, your, your heavenly robe at that point.  Now, if you know that you're kind of a bad guy, right?  And you know, the 21st of October, it's all over and you're being judged and there's  no redemption.  You're done. 
[00:21:30]  Um, wouldn't you just go on a rape rampage or something?  Of course.  Robbery.  Of course.  And then blame this guy.  And then blame this guy.  And then blame this guy.  Go, hey, I'm fucked here.  I thought it was over.  I'm screwed.  I thought the rules didn't apply here, sir.  I'm not sure about the redemption thing, but I think you're done.  I think if judgment day is started, uh, it's judgment day.  It's not atonement.  I think you're done.  I don't think there's any deathbed confessions left.  Tongue punch in North port goes, this guy's using a magic eight ball. 
[00:22:00]  That's the problem.  He's just, ah, signs point to try again later.  I like when the eight ball would get all lazy on your ass and tired, try again later.  And what kid would put it down and go, all right, I'll be back in like two hours.  All right.  Later meant one turn, like time it takes to turn it back over.  Right.  Ah, I'm in.  So I guess we're done with this guy or we're going to have to hear from him up until October.  Uh, he's got one more in him, I think. 
[00:22:30]  Is he making money off this?  I can't imagine, ah, let's see a family radio, I guess is, is, uh, his organization.  It requested an extension to file their nonprofit paperwork.  Um, I guess they're required to submit financial documents in a lot of states where they solicit  donations.  And in Minnesota, they requested an extension from their July 15th deadline to November 15th, 
[00:23:00]  which is after October 23rd.  Ah.  So, you know, the legality and the paperwork so they could pocket a little more cash and  shit like that.  That goes past his deadline.  He's got the, he's got everyone paying attention to him.  Bamboozled.  We can't get anyone to pay attention to us, but this fucking guy came up with a great scheme.  Why didn't we come up with this?  This is a good one.  Cause, uh, it's a hoax.  Oh.  We would have been screwed.  Yeah.  The hoax rule would have got us, right? 
[00:23:30]  Uh, shock jocks Opie and Anthony in trouble again, predicting the end of the world.  Meanwhile, they're reporting it like it's real news.  Right.  If we said it, we're just, oh boy.  You might remember these two from the sex at St. Pat's Cathedral scandal.  They're now saying the end of the world.  Uh, people are calling for their ouster.  Yeah.  Really?  Did you guys, um, get the audio from the news stations on Saturday?  No. 
[00:24:00]  What were they doing?  It might be worth trying to find Travis.  Uh, I was watching a little bit and this, this, I, I, I think she's on MSNBC and she  has to fucking dolly herself up to do the news.  Gussied up.  And it drives me fucking nuts.  Cause I know she's more concerned about her appearance than being a news woman.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got, she's using a curling iron before she goes on TV and the makeup's gotta be right.  And they're all trying to compete with the Fox news broads.  Right.  And then right.  Fucking model, the modeling. 
[00:24:30]  Model after model.  Right.  Shit.  Hottest fucking girls over there.  Oh, without a doubt.  MSNBC has, has broads and Fox has some, some babes.  Yeah.  You're right.  Rachel Maddow.  Is she a woman?  I don't even know.  I don't even know what that is.  I really don't know.  And it's CNN.  You'll have like a couple of nice looking girls, but then they'll bring on some woman  who absolutely knows what she's talking about because that's the only fucking reason to  put her in front of a camera.  She's the pig faced one.  Like she has got, you know who you're talking about? 
[00:25:00]  She's horrid.  Her nose even pushes up like a pig's nose a little bit.  Oh God.  She's disgusting.  Horrible.  And it's fucking blonde bombshells, big tits.  They're all showing leg.  Yeah.  It's like, this is the best fucking news.  I think I'm, I'm being pulled over to the right wing side.  Oh, that was their whole fucking thing.  I think they're fucking me up a little bit.  Cause they know these righties are fucking secretly the most perverted motherfuckers out  there.  You know, I'm family values and I'm a Christian and I take a holy shit. 
[00:25:30]  Look at the tits on her.  Tits on her.  You know what you do with your right hand now, don't you?  Jack off.  Yeah, that's right.  More people jack off with their right hand than their left.  It's a fact.  It's just easier.  It's a fact.  That's only because the left thumb is better at ball nudging.  The left thumb is better.  What happens is you take the left hand.  Oh, you're talking the reverse jerk.  I don't know.  I jerk regular, but I take the left hand and I slip it between the sack and leg.  And I take the left knuckle on the top of the knuckle. 
[00:26:00]  And it kind of, it works as like a little fucking thing for my balls to rest on.  Shit.  A speed bump.  Kind of.  Yeah.  I put my, I, I fucking put my thumb under my balls.  It's like opening a puzzle box.  You don't touch your balls when you jerk off?  Thumb between the balls.  I'll tug them with my left hand.  It all depends if it's going to be a long fucking romantic jerk.  Uh, it could take a while, you know, and then you fiddle around.  If it's, you know, I got 10 minutes here and I got, you know, got a shower also. 
[00:26:30]  Uh, then you just, your basic, uh, tug and, and complete.  Get the fuck out.  My nipple.  I've played with my nipples so much in the last few days.  It's actually sore.  Really?  I realized fucking it's awful.  I know.  That's the oddest thing.  I don't understand that nipple play.  I wish I didn't.  That's ticklish.  That's weird.  Look at these Fox chicks.

[00:51:30]  they can afford both  yes  hey the second half of the song you interrupted  yeah  jesus  the not too boy  yeah  i don't like that being the only version though  i love that  you got a new version  oh what is the version  because the ragah version  the reggae version  my favorite  well there's all different  i mean everyone  which one is there now  well in honor of obama going overseas  and getting his limo stuck  hey  you've got a good boy phone  and a nutty boy phone  he's doing a leprechaun dance 
[00:52:00]  where he kicks one leg up at a time  was that a jig  he was doing the jig  was that a jig for the  he was doing the jig  i was doing a little irish dance  to commemorate  a good boy phone  oh he's got a good boy phone  and a nutty boy phone  i'll be doing that now  all fucking night  would you have to kick up the leg  you gotta kick your leg up  and your arm has to go up  just picture a tiny little leprechaun  dancing around his  pato gold  yeah  pato 
[00:52:30]  the pato gold  you think obama shit his pants  when that limo got stuck  for a second or two  was he in it when it happened  did he actually get out of it  or not  they're not gonna tell us  i've heard yes  i've heard no  they're not gonna tell us  but they'll never tell you  if he was in a certain limo or not  it was the bulletproof  motherfucker limo  they both are  they both are  yeah they both are  so it was one of those  it wasn't just one of the  other cars  i told him  before the show  i've seen the motor kid  a few times now  and i think  obama's gotta be in the second one  every single time  they make believe 
[00:53:00]  he could possibly be in the first one  no way  because  you know  whoever wants to do harm  to the president  you gotta talk about this  very carefully  because there's ears  all over the place  but if you wanna do harm  to the president  you're gonna be a fucking  nervous fucking nelly  and do whatever you have planned  soon as you see the  first limo  wait for it  wait for it  you're not gonna have  the patience to go  and decide if he's not  in the first one  so you think you're just  gonna go for the first one  every time  every time  if you're one of those  kooks that wanna do harm 
[00:53:30]  if you know that  now you would go for  the second one  knowing he's in there  yeah but i think  i think the odds are  they know the type of person  that would wanna do  something like that  would just fucking panic  and just be the panicky pete  i wonder if he's ever  not in the limo at all  like does he ever ride  in one of the SUVs  maybe they're bullet  and bomb proof too  does he ever like ride  like in one of the first cars  he's in a Datsun B210  but where you'd never expect him  like a horrible van  like in between  a couple of cops  with a hat on or something  he's in a Chevette 
[00:54:00]  right a van  yeah exactly  like riding on the  motorcycle cop's back  in a cocktail dress  or the SUV that's fully armed  with those guys  that look like  they're from a video game  holy shit  with the windows down  and they are just  staring at everybody  who could be in the  middle of that thing  those guys have fully  automatic machine guns  they can assemble  very quickly  yep  and yeah  i've seen some shots  of those guys  where they  they're just  carrying those  guns with the windows open 
[00:54:30]  the back hatch opened  and they're just looking like  yeah we'll fucking  decimate anybody  that even comes near us  i wanna go to the white house  i wanna see like the west wing  but i need like a six week  there's a huge security  waiting list  yeah  you gotta wait for your  security  i think so  pass  i got my picture back  by the way  with the fucking  what's that guy  secretary of the army  he's the head of the army  oh the head of the army  yeah he's the guy  can I see your phone  the army man  fuck  GI Joe  no he's a civilian 
[00:55:00]  he's the civilian head of the army  GI Joe  GI Joe  fighting man  head to toe  but they said  there's like a white  barricade around it  i don't know why  there's a white barrier  around it  oh well that happens  hey can we take a break  oh yeah we gotta eat  um when we get back  i do have local news coverage  of judgment day  these fucking assholes  judgment day  also  i wasn't here yesterday  but  and i'm sure you guys  talked about it  but i need to know  about the poconos  and i need to know  a little more about  kareem abdul jabbar  motherfucker 
[00:55:30]  ah jimmy's uh  meeting of kareem  i was lazy man  i could have came back  with jimmy  i'm such an asshole  and that's a huge one  fucking  he's the leading scorer  in nba history  i was telling jimmy  i saw jimmy on the street  the other day  i'm like  he's gotta be  top five  greatest athletes  of all time  and roger murdoch  what about  a great pilot  oh  he's the co-pilot  jesus  yeah  i'm the co-pilot  give me your top five  athletes of all time  yeah 
[00:56:00]  kareem  i would make that  fucking list  you gotta go jordan  you gotta go ali  jesse owens  ali  um  babe ruth  gotta go ruth  yeah i guess  i don't know man  athlete of all time  base  maybe  maybe you do  jabbar is  close  maybe he doesn't  make the top five  but he is way  the fuck  bill buckner  bill fucking  bill buckner  i appreciate  i appreciate his work  pale  yeah for soccer  i mean  he's not for us  but they stopped  the civil war one time 
[00:56:30]  if this country  cared about soccer  then i would put him  on the list  sorry but we don't  and it's  we never will  our list has to  have something to do  with america  jimmy  america  he's certainly the  biggest basketball player  i think he is  i mean  come on  michael jordan didn't  come close to his record  he retired but  no  well yeah  when jordan decided  to sit out  you know  when he was  at the top of his  fucking game  he could have been  closer  how far was jordan  away from  huh  oh i didn't know 
[00:57:00]  he was that close  is he right  is he between  wilt and uh  six thousand's  about two to  carl malone's  number two  is malone two  i thought fucking  jordan was two  no  malone is less  than two thousand  away  is he still playing  no  no  oh he is  done  yeah malone's  been done  for a while  the only active  guy on the  top list  is kobe bryan  he's at number  six  he's about  eleven thousand  i hope he doesn't  make it  he's a twat  i want kareem  to have it  eleven thousand's  about  that's doable  that's  that's four  good seasons  right  about  i really 
[00:57:30]  i don't know  i think  i think a good  season  you're doing  clue  two good  games  two good  games  there you go  i don't like  kobe's  you know  i hope kareem  uh  jim thorpe  on your  athlete list  get the fuck  out of here  come on  jim thorpe  jim thorpe  there's no  deon sanders  you gotta have to  have you have to  have footage of  the guy  bo jackson  bo nose  bo  remember bo  nose  bo was a bust  my picture  with kareem  is a fucking  good one too  kaley  muhammad ali  i want to get  that blown up 
[00:58:00]  who would be on  your list  jim brown  not a huge sports  guy i understand  no no  who would be on  your list  all time  yeah  you gotta go ali  that's a guarantee  sugar ray  robinson  if you have ali  that's it  you can't throw  another fighter in  there  but i mean  if they're  legitimate  if ali was  then it wouldn't  even be ali  probably  it'd be sugar ray  robinson  if it was  you know i prefer ali  top 50 athletes  of all  the 20th century  who put this  together  this was 
[00:58:30]  espn sports  is kareem  even on  wow kareem  is not even up  there  kareem is  number 26  well they go  michael jordan  number one  they go  babe ruth  number two  babe ruth  number two  and ali  and ali  and ali  three  we had  we had  three of the  top five  and then they  went jim brown  wayne gretzky  wayne gretzky  was fucking  assholes  how is ali  behind babe ruth  he fucking  knocked out  george foreman  he knocked out  fucking foreman  babe ruth 
[00:59:00]  fucked a lot  of girls  and he was fat  and he smoked  cigars  and still  played ball  ali went to  jail  or he didn't  go to jail  but he was  out of the  game for  three years  and then he  fucking  knocked out  george foreman  how is he  behind fucking  michael jordan  who threw a  ball in a  hoop  how is every  boxer not  above fucking  michael jordan  you can make  everything sound  so like  how is  sugar  robinson  against him  over michael  jordan  or fucking  lamada who  never got  knocked down  it's hard  to put another  fighter up there  if you have  ali i'm  telling you  they're tough 
[00:59:30]  they're top  athletes  this guy  this top ten  so then you  got wayne gretzky  at five  jesse owens  at six  jim thorpe  at seven  willie mays  at eight  jack nicholas  at nine  and babes  at harris  wait let me  get this  so jesse  owens  and then your  next fighter  is joe lewis  at eleven  jesse owens  who fucking  ran against  racehorses  is behind  wayne gretzky  who skated  how the fuck  does that  make sense  that makes sense  because running  a race against  a racehorse  was just silly  while he was  skating  he didn't even  have a chance  he did happen  to put the puck  in a goal 
[01:00:00]  a few times  no no but  i'm saying  as far as  being a pure  athlete  he also won  in munich  jesse owens  and hitler  refused to  shake his  hand  jesse owens  should take  him off the  fucking list  right there  didn't jesse  owens only  have to run  a hundred yards  and the stupid  horse had to  run a quarter  i mean come  on  still  he got a head  start  it was horrible  he got a head  zany  i don't like  wacky sports  muhammad ali  oh muhammad ali  did wacky sports  yes he did  the exhibition  the wrestling  thing  where he 
[01:00:30]  fucking  fought a wrestler  and the wrestler  was just on his  back the entire  time  so fucking ali  did wacky sports  jordan never  did wacky sports  oh jordan  did wacky sports  he did baseball  that's wacky sports  i put the oil  can up there  the boy  yeah he was  crazy  that was fun  they're just  trying to  mix up all  the sports  to be again  that's like  putting a woman  on a list  or a black  guy on a list  or a white  guy on a list  just because  you have to  don't tell me  that fucking  why am i 
[01:01:00]  taking this  so seriously  the list  isn't that  bad  jimmy  sugar  robinson  it's not  that bad  at all  sugar  robinson's  24  hold on  where's  and fucking  number 11  is uh  joe lewis  joe lewis  is five  behind  fucking  wayne  gretzky  but that's  because ali  using my  theory  if you put  a boxer  way up  there  then you  can't put  another  boxer  close  and that's  why  if you have  jordan up  there  that's why  you gotta  push  kareem down  on the list  i get it  will chamberlain's  13th place  will fucking  chamberlain scored  100 points  in one game  and he's in  13th place  no it's an  athlete list  which 
[01:01:30]  babe ruth  hit over  700 home  runs  and before  that he was  a very successful  pitcher  and he was  hit  you're right  and babe ruth  was also  hitting more  home runs  than teams  were back  then  that's why  i freaked  out  and i went  okay i kind  of get it  comparatively  where's macho  man on this  list  last on the  driving list  go down  the list  more  look  aaron surpassed  ruth  and aaron's  14  you know  right but  when aaron was  doing it  there were also  but also when  babe ruth was 
[01:02:00]  doing it  you'd face the  same pitcher  through a double  header  so it was a  little bit  different than  hank aaron was  doing it  but that  argument  doesn't hold  up because  babe ruth had  more home  runs than  entire  teams  because other  teams had the  same shit  where they were  facing the  same pitchers  and they  weren't as  successful as  ruth  some people  would say  that's because  the hitting  psychology was  different then  they weren't  always going  why was there  another player  even close to  what babe ruth  was accomplishing  that's what's  so creepy 
[01:02:30]  i think he  belongs up  there  i'm annoyed  that ali isn't  first  come on  the iron horse  luke garrick  34  sure  he played  the most  games in  a row  why not  no  he should  he should be  higher up on  the list  yeah  where's ripkin  named after him  where's ripkin  is he on there  he should be  number one  but  come on  uh  julius irving  43  dr j  my point being  kareem abdul  jabbar  26 
[01:03:00]  that's a little  rough  who's number  100  oh it's the top  100  who's number  100  jack johnson  jack  yeah sure  jack johnson  number 100  84 is man o' war  that's good  this list  fucking eats my  ass  look at 80  richard petty  is not an athlete  i saw aj foy too  you idiot  richard petty  not an athlete  well let me tell you  something  in my nascar career  i i've noticed  it does take a lot  of physical stamina  i want to i want to  talk about the  poconos after the 
[01:03:30]  break  definitely because  yeah absolutely  this list bugs me  what  this list bugs me  this list really is  bothering you  why does it  it's okay  a lot of race car  drivers between 50  and 100  andretti aj  foyte  man  because they're  sacrificing the  right answer for  the better athlete  just to get the  other sport in  there  hey where's  derrick poundstone  on that list  i don't think he  made it  no he didn't  make the top  100  where's payne  stewart  is he in there  under freezing 
[01:04:00]  freezing  just dead in the  air  being really cold  yet still flying  didn't they say  like a plane  went close to  see everyone  just dead  everyone was  dead and the  plane was on  autopilot  just waiting to  run out of fuel  it was like just  a plane of  frozen dead  people  that is creepy  who's the last  guy alive going  holy shit  i'm really  fucking cold  it's freezing  i got no air  and then just  looking around  like  oh my god  the plane's just  like  just flying through 
[01:04:30]  the air  did they all just  pass out you think  though like  yeah they passed  out before they  died  there was no  pressure in there  and then uh  they noticed the  windows were frozen  from the inside  when they pulled  the plane next to  that one  how cold was it  though like  fucking it's  it had to be  really cold  it's up there  cruising altitude  cold  no but why  was there  why does it  get cold  when you lose  pressure  like why  couldn't the  pilots feel  that coming  or they think  it happened  immediately  wasn't there  there was a leak  right  yeah yeah  there was a leak  there was a leak  i don't think it  was one of those  catastrophic things  i would think it 
[01:05:00]  was one of those  slow things  that made everybody  just kind of  pass out  but when you're  cold  when you're sleeping  at night and you're  cold because maybe  a tootsie's  a little cold  you wake right the  fuck up so why  didn't these guys  wake up going  i'm getting  fucking cold  yeah i'm getting  a little chilly  what the hell is  this about  because the lack  of air they  would probably  greatest coaches  of the 20th century  i like how on the  list they separated  by gender it's  91 men  6 women  3 horses  horses  there's 3 horses  it's a politically  correct list that's  why it annoys me 
[01:05:30]  greatest coach of  all  no it's not that  bad jimmy  i don't think it's  that bad  fucking billy  jean king's  ahead of jack  johnson as an  athlete  well she  well i guess  richard petty's  ahead of it  doesn't make sense  to me  i guess we can't  really call her a  she  one of the horses  one of the horses  the one from that  farm in  he's a champ to  me  he put up some  numbers  he certainly did  what an athlete  wow  colon wrecking  the old  he's great at that 
[01:06:00]  pelvic thrust move  uh oh  his friend tried to  block but  nope he bust right  through  perforated colon  with a horse  cop  he's got a good  hoof phone  and a naughty  hoof phone  the horsey  version  with that we're  gonna go to  break  oh yeah  all right  oh uh jimmy  fallon's stopping  by today right  that's cool  that's very cool  he's got a new  little do you call  it a book  it's uh got pages 
[01:06:30]  and covers  i know it's a great  bit on his show  the thank yous that  he does on fridays  and now he made  a book out of it  called thank you  notes  jimmy fallon  with the writers  of late night  and it's a little  like uh coffee  table book right  yes  throw it up there  it's got legs  that fall down  this is a great  toilet book  this is the one  you keep in the  bathroom  it's a good  joke book  and you read  on the ball  these books  are great for  that  you could read  this in  probably two  shits  I think you 
[01:07:00]  can read this  in two shits  depends  you've got to  sit there  and let your  ass cool off  yeah  it's going to  take a while  all right  hit that  eight  the virus  get in touch  with the  opian anthony  show  866  wow  one  wow  send your  feedback  to  feedback  at  opianthony  dot com  opianthony  i'm wearing 
[01:07:30]  a u2 t-shirt  today  did you hear  did you hear  bono's profound  speech on the  billboard music  award  no  wow  i couldn't watch  the billboard  i tried to watch  the billboard  music awards  horrid  i saw the  beyonce thing  it so happened  that's the  part i caught  was just dancing  in front of a  screen  and yeah  it's like  what did bono  say  bono babbled  for three 
[01:08:00]  minutes maybe  not even  and then  like was just  removed by  uh  one of the other  guys in the band  what do you mean  just kind of  pushed to the  side and like  we'd like to  thank uh  because  what were they  getting  bono was just  some kind of  fucking like  you rule award  humanitarian  or was it  for his music  what was he  doing  it's  it was for  their tour  or some shit  like being  amazing and  everything  okay  and uh  they show  it  they went 
[01:08:30]  for like  15 minutes  showing the  tour  and what  goes into  putting on  uh  that  putting up  that set  and everything  and they go  and let  now ladies  and gentlemen  you too  and they just  walk out  it's like  you know  they couldn't  play a song  or something  no they're  at that point  in their careers  they don't have to  play a song  anymore  and then  ronald got on  mic and just  started rambling  about  you can make  music  in like  your living  room  and you can  make  music on a  little piece 
[01:09:00]  of carpet  or whatever  and then like  it was just  like hey  yeah yeah  okay  and thank you  for  he was just  trying to be  profound  he was trying  but it was  like it wasn't  about apartheid  it wasn't about  fucking starvation  it must suck  to try to be  profound  all the time  he seems to be  one of those guys  that he thinks  he has to be  profound  every time  he's in front  of a microphone  I think he lost  it though  it was like  you know  when he was  like you know  we go to  cure AIDS  and stuff like  that  it's like  alright  whatever 
[01:09:30]  but  he's been  around long  enough to know  that it's all  bullshit  and nothing  really changes  but when he  was young  and full of  fucking  cum and piss  and whatever  the saying is  piss and vinegar  he was gonna  change the world  but now  he's in his  late 40s  he might even  be in his 50s  at this point  he's like  oh shit  nothing really  changes  yeah nothing  changed  we barely  saved any  of the rainforest  at this point  we've been  fighting that  cause for 20  years  so instead of  donating money  to stuff  let's just build  an amazing set 
[01:10:00]  that costs  millions  and trucking  around  it's amazing  right  all that money  wasted  why not just  do like  if that's the  issue  why not just  do a  simple  set  why would  you spend  that much  on a  fucking  worthless  show  their set  is crazy  he's a pompous  ass  these guys  aren't aging  though  that's kind  of creepy  well Bono  on a close up  they showed  during the  billboard music  award  you could see  yeah  the edge  hasn't aged  no the edge  looks like the edge  but if you wear  a hat like that  all the time 
[01:10:30]  yeah  he's like a  cartoon  the edge  is like a  cartoon character  he just has  one outfit  there's a lot  of medicine  in that hair  though huh  they all got  medicine in their hair  yeah a little medicine  well not all of them  I guess  what's his name  doesn't  he's like the  fucking charlie watts  of the band  doesn't care  why don't I know  his name  I love this  Gilbert Godfrey  it's Gilbert Godfrey  there you go  really quickly  I was driving home  from Philly  and I wanted to  check out our channel  because we had a lot  of excitement  on our channel 
[01:11:00]  over the weekend  yes  and I discovered  my car is  two years old  now I guess  uh huh  and I think  we're on  Sirius 206  I know we goof  about that  from time to time  because the channel  change really  fucking got  everyone confused  XM 105  Sirius 206  that's it right  yeah  so I'm driving home  and I'm thinking  to myself  man there's a lot  going on  on our channel  I want to  check it out  see how it's  sounding  long story short  my fucking car  does not get 
[01:11:30]  Sirius 206  oh it doesn't  what the fuck  is that about  without bitching  and complaining  and yelling  and screaming  about this stupid  company  why doesn't my car  get 206  could someone  explain this  to me  what a coincidence  because as I was  driving home  in the Shelby  which I have a  Sirius radio in  and a Sirius account  I too was searching  for the virus  and to no avail  you didn't have it  either  to no avail  could I  we didn't even talk  about the truck either  you're kidding  no I talked to Gary 
[01:12:00]  we didn't even talk  about this off air  no you have to  give the number  you have to give  your radio number  wait O.B. Anthony  and Jim Norton  it's our channel  we all can't listen  to our own channel  and our cars  and don't fuck up  my XM account  with the Escalade  because that ain't  the one  it's the Shelby  so what does that mean  you have to get  the number off  the radio  why  I'm guessing  they have to reset  but I think  that's all they have  to do  reset  no I think  they have to add  the premium  XM package  which they pulled 
[01:12:30]  from us  when they  why would they  switch channels  why  they switched channels  and went like  ah fuck them  let them just go  to the basic shit  and then I  I went through  every single channel  because I thought  I was missing something  our channel  wouldn't even come up  on my radio  no 206  doesn't even exist  so it's going to exist  after they do what  and what do I have to do  who do I talk to  like  this is a pain in the ass  you can't make it  such a pain in the ass  to get people to listen  no  because I gave up  I'm like  you know what  I don't need to listen  to me  you know how many 
[01:13:00]  listeners we lost  that's so stupid  you know how many  listeners we probably  lost through this  change over channels  don't you think  the advertising  will reflect  oh that's right  that doesn't exist  either  that's right  right  you're right  we probably did  because people  don't know where it is  or they don't realize  that they have to  reset their radios  or whatever  because they're not  going to make it easier  they're saying  we have to pay  for the best of XM  package  but we work here  we had that  I ain't paying  to hear my own  fucking show  that's right  no one should  but then because 
[01:13:30]  of the channel change  they took away  all the best of XM  packages  I guess  yeah  why would they do that  that doesn't make sense  I don't fucking get it  because wouldn't that  make people go  yeah I don't really need it  yeah yeah  now let me not get it  let me  you know what  I don't need to get it  whatever  unbelievable man  unbelievable  give it to us  oh wow  the phone's just  fucking exploded  that means  that means  our problem  is their problem  is their problem  they're having the same issue 
[01:14:00]  of course they are  motherfucker  had a serious radio  couldn't get you guys  had to buy  the XM package  but what if you had  the XM package  did they take  the XM package  away from everybody  yeah what was the deal  did I have the XM package  and when I was able  to listen on  on serious  you did have it  I did  and it probably  just got fucked up  on the computer  when I switched  and a channel change  I bet it was  a fucking calculated move  and I'll say it again  and they got mad at me  because I  I kind of nodded  when they told me  this off air  but a channel change 
[01:14:30]  without us being  on the same channel  on both  is so stupid  why bother  well without the name  of the channel  being Opie and Anthony  well that  that's always been an issue  for years  yeah we gave up on that  what are you gonna do  you're gonna make yourself  fucking sick  what is Martha Stewart's  channel called  The Cake  is it called  it's called The Cake  The Cake  because she bakes  but don't other  named people  have their fucking  name on the channel  The Collage  her channel is called  we spend millions  on this horse shit 
[01:15:00]  I think it's  I think it's  something like that  is the name  give a list of the channel  Travis  perjury to the grand jury  Tanner Boyle hair  115  give her a little  tussling  it's called  no one gives a shit  about your treats  so wait  Stuart  so Martha Stewart  is that her channel name  Martha Stewart  Living Radio  this argument  by the way  that well  Opie and Anthony  are not the only show  on the platform  I get that 
[01:15:30]  but is Martha Stewart  on 24 hours a day  no she's not  unfortunately no  but why is her name  why is Oprah Radio  Oprah Radio  when fucking Oprah  is not always on  so that fucking argument  we've been given  is shit  we've been given it  since XM  this is not new  with Sirius  well you also have  Rod and Fez  there's no disrespect  to them  or other shows  on the weekend  fine  but people who are  looking for Opie and Anthony  should be able to see  the Opie and Anthony thing  instead of the virus  the company does not want  the name of this show  associated with it 
[01:16:00]  I'm not being paranoid  and crazy  it'll be fun to see  who's on the virus  after we're long gone  XM 105  this guy's telling me  we're on XM 105  I have a Sirius radio  because I bought  a car that has Sirius  shut up  I looked at XM 105  dummy on my fucking radio  it wasn't there  there isn't a 105  wait  you have an XM car  I have an XM Escalade  which I get everything  wait a minute  I get  I have a Sirius  what are you talking about 
[01:16:30]  in my Escalade  I have XM  because this could be  a bigger problem  in my Escalade  I have XM  so I go to 105  and I get the virus  in my Shelby  I have a Sirius account  I cannot get our show  oh yeah okay  that makes sense  yeah yeah  yeah okay  which is  you know  but see that guy's confused  because he's saying  it's XM 105  it's XM 105  yeah dummy  that's the point I'm making  this is very confusing  for a lot of people  this guy's trying to help us out  but he's confused too  he's totally confused 
[01:17:00]  I have XM in the house  so yes I get us on 105  we're not talking about XM  but my car is Sirius  and for some reason  they said  you know what  he doesn't need  the best of package anymore  who's he  yeah  so then I couldn't even  listen to our own channel  over the weekend  with all these exciting  things happening  the virus  with Rogan  yeah right  Rogan comes on  and we came  that's why I want to  check it out  I'm like I want to  okay I want to see  I don't listen to our channel  a lot because we  you know we want to  get away from this  we got more people  trying to help  and it's just not working  what  Fat Matt is saying 
[01:17:30]  exit 105 off the parkway  is Red Bank  is it  yeah  nice  I don't think he  understands the problem  we're really trying to  to get across here  it's not an exit  it's our show  is there any answers  coming from down the hall  I really want to know  why I couldn't listen  to our channel  over the weekend  I want to know  why the name of the channel  we have been given  a bullshit answer  about that  for five years  yeah  why is the name  of the channel  just not Opie Anthony 
[01:18:00]  and naming it  the virus  doesn't make sense  it stinks  it used to sort of  make sense  never makes  that was an Elo move  it was a bad move  by Elo  I love Elo  but that was a bad move  no that was to  replace high voltage  which was horrible  oh  so we had to  quickly come up  with a name  that wasn't  Opie Anthony  for whatever reason  so that was the best  we could come up with  at the time  they would go  with Opie Anthony  I don't know why  I don't know why  they don't understand  that when you brand something  because we're not  household names  no  in their eyes  we're not household names  like Martha Stewart  this is the real answer  it hurts our 
[01:18:30]  it hurts our  egos and our souls  but this is what  they would tell you  we're not household names  like the rest of them  like Martha Stewart  Howard Stern  Oprah  Oprah  and Foxhole  but I get that  but my argument  to them would be  wouldn't you want to  build new household names  so if you got a child  that has Opie Anthony  you're building  the brand  you're building  the household name  right there  in front of everyone's eyes  how could it hurt  to call it Opie Anthony  it's the same as  calling it the virus  but what's more recognizable  virus or Opie Anthony 
[01:19:00]  I mean even if it's not  a household name  what's more recognizable  virus is very  virus means nothing  you get sick  people get sick all the time  it's AIDS radio  they just won't change the name  they do not  want the public association  or whatever  that's why it's not  in the advertising  it is what it is  and Bob is not going  to do anything about it  well we're going to start  our big advertising push  because I saw  Scott in the bathroom  and he wants me  and Ant to take  wireless microphones  to Times Square  or something 
[01:19:30]  I went yeah  yeah  that's so we can  get out of the building  and then I got in a fight  with the guy  with the people  again  because I go  that's stupid  I go that's  that's like  that's stupid  I go that's hacky radio  and then I actually  said to him  I go god  I can't believe  I'm saying something  but fuck it  I have nothing to lose  at this point  I go  would Howard  just take  wireless mics  into Times Square  and he goes  well he did  he did that  in Union Square  I go that's when  he was announcing  to the world  that he was going  to satellite radio 
[01:20:00]  that was a big  fucking deal  but to tell me  and Ant to take  wireless microphones  and broadcast  from Times Square  is a dumb idea  so you want us  to do the walkover  again pretty much  I go  that's it  I said  Eric Logan  years ago  said when you guys  go out  it should be  bigger than life  and I told him that  I'm like  us just taking  wireless mics  and going out  to Times Square  is embarrassing  but he's obsessed  with us doing  some weird  how about an  animation festival  well that's what  I told him  I said we had  our big events  that you took  away from us 
[01:20:30]  what happened  with the animation festival  I don't know  what did happen  to that  they just wanted  too big of a piece  or something  I don't understand  what they wanted  piece of what  the action  what action  was there to get  was there money  to be made there  we did it for free  what was the difference  between the first one  we did it for free  and then the one  we wanted to do  again  like what changed  from the first one  to the one we wanted  to do again  because the first one  was very successful  let's just carbon copy it  and do it again 
[01:21:00]  Bob needs to be  all over this  I don't understand  what changed  in that period of time  I forgot  it was something  that didn't make sense  yeah obviously  oh god  yeah but it got in my face  Howard did that  I'm like no  that's different  he did it  because he was  announcing that  he's going to satellite  that was huge  at the time  me and Ant  taking wireless mics  to Times Square  that's not a huge event  that's not huge  we look like idiots  but that's what  they think of us  that's why 
[01:21:30]  look like assholes man  that's what they think  of us  they think we're still  like just a hacky  fucking  you know  radio show  that should be  broadcasting from  gas stations  and such  yeah  why don't we do that  we'll give away some  that's too bad  105  one dollar  and five cent gas  unless you have  a serious radio  and then you don't  get gas  right  yeah  or 268  to match the channel  it's two different  prices  two different prices  hey what kind of car  you roll up with  other people can't 
[01:22:00]  get it at all  leave  you can't get it  exactly  have some fucking  diesel shit in  they should just  put us on the same  channel on both  like why are they  making everything  so complicated  all the time  and the point  without like  continuing with this  I just want to know  why I can't get  our channel  in my car  yeah  and what do I  have to do now  that's more of a  hassle  just fix it  because I don't  want to talk to  anyone after the  show about this  or couldn't they  put them a hundred  apart  like the technology  wouldn't allow them  to do that  I understand that  but couldn't they  go 107  207 
[01:22:30]  you can't say  I understand that  ever with these  guys  they could have  figured it out  if they wanted to  technologically  no they  they decide  they wanted to  alright  to make us  206 on both  we don't need to  be on 105  they could put us  on any channel  it's more important  to be on the same  fucking channel  on both platforms  so they could have  figured it out  they could put us  on any channel  they own the company  they could have  figured it out  yeah  logistically  they could put us  on any channel  on either platform  I think everyone 
[01:23:00]  on the XM side  had that though  I think Oprah's  on different channels  anybody who was  best of XM  had to deal with that  so if they were  going to do it  they could have  done it smart  110 210  something that  people could wrap  their head around  instead of 105  and 206  which is horrendous  to them they think  moving down to 105  is good channel  placement  but they couldn't  do that on  Sirius  my point would be  they want you to  just put us  way up in the  dial on both  that would make  more sense in the  end  until this weekend 
[01:23:30]  I didn't know  what channel we were  on  and I finally said  oh wait  it is 206  because we goofed  on so much  I didn't know  and when I went  to 206  and we weren't  there  I'm like  wow  I don't think  we're on 206  ok let me  let me check  every channel  which I did  if we're confused  and we were here  I had a long ride  so I said  fuck it  so what do I  need to do  to get our channel  I'm sure customer  service is helping  people  someone called me  and someone wrote  me and said  they were on hold  for three hours  trying to get 
[01:24:00]  our channel  where the fuck  did I read that  somebody  someone close to us  oh it was  Otto  Otto and George  on Twitter  Otto said that  and I didn't even  discuss this with him  he wrote me  out of frustration  he said  since the channel  changed  I don't get you guys  so I'm up to  three hours  waiting on customer  service  to figure out  what I need to do  that's right  I swear to god  where is that  you believe me 
[01:24:30]  right  yeah yeah  I read that one  oh you did read that  like yeah  can't get a cocksucker  was that a tweet  or a direct message  I believe it was  a tweetage  oh he was tweeting  that  yes  so yeah  he said  he said  he was up to  three hours  on customer service  he just  had the phone  in his hand  all fucking day  trying to get  the shit  straightened out  but you know  need your radio  ID number  do we have an answer  we just need to  give him ID numbers 
[01:25:00]  oh is it coming  through now  is the answer  coming through  I was watching  a program  on the satellite  that went to  the moon  yeah  of Saturn  Titan  nice  and what they had to do  because there were some  problems  right  and how they  reprogramed  certain things  on a fucking  satellite  that was  near Saturn  wow  yet  there's a  logistics problem  that they can't put us  on a certain channel  because of technical issues  stop it 
[01:25:30]  they lack logic  they really do  oh please  they lack logic  dude this satellite  around Saturn  was fucked  they were like  oh my god  we spent all this  time and money  there's no way  to fix this problem  it's fucked up  the little probe  won't talk to the  big satellite  to send the signal  back to earth  because the wavelength  is too narrow  right  and then they figured out  well if we slow  the satellite down  while it's transmitting 
[01:26:00]  to the other satellite  it'll slow  the rate  that the waves  hit the other satellite  like  you know when you're  beeping a car horn  and you pass someone  it goes  the Doppler effect  they're like  we'll use the Doppler effect  by slowing the satellite down  and then it'll  make the wave form  wider  until it  equaled out  with the little probe  thing  it's like  what genius  is thinking of this shit  and they're like  nope  105-206  is all we can do  we can't have the 
[01:26:30]  fucking time  do you understand  what they fucking do  but that  you know  the guys that  that have  any self  worth  they left this company  a long time ago  I know  so you're left with  dummies that think  that's logical  those satellites  are spinning up  I think the whole company  has their fingers crossed  like  I hope nothing goes wrong  with those satellites  because we don't even know  what to do with them anymore  you know  they're just spinning around  up there going  I hope they continue to work  because we fired  everyone that runs them  and you notice  Howard's on 
[01:27:00]  the same on both  see  yeah yeah  says it all right there  it can be done  you know  that's their guy  I understand that  that's their logic  so they figured out for him  but for us  it's all over the fucking place  yeah  doesn't make sense  because they had in their head  that better channel placement  was really good  but  they couldn't do it for both  so they decided to separate it  like this  it's just  Mars is looking at a screen  at mission control  going  I don't have  unplug it 
[01:27:30]  cable  yeah  unplug it  I guess  no next week  someone's going to come in  next week with the parts  for that  who came up with this  the channel change thing  and logically  this made sense to people  because when you run promos  and stuff  people don't listen  the first thing you learn  about radio  they don't really listen  as closely as you think  they do  so when they hear promos  105, 206  they're like what  hey great  they're promoing the channels  imagine when we were  on regular radio  if we could have been  on every 
[01:28:00]  you know  same dial placement  how great  they would have done that  in a second  yeah amazing  because that was confusing  for everybody  when we were talking about  yeah Philly  or Boston or something  you know  just go everywhere  you tune in  we will be on  blank  you know this frequency  they would have done that  in a second  if they had the opportunity  this place had the opportunity  and they decided not to do it  it's very difficult  alright so I have to give  my radio ID number  and how do I find that  in my car 
[01:28:30]  channel 1  I don't think channel 1  exists anymore  let me see  I didn't see  now there's a way to get it  if you click on any station  god  there's a website  you can go to  while you're  to go to  while in your car  on the radio  how about this  I emailed Gary  a picture of it  I took a photo  of the radio ID number  and then just  sent him a text  or whatever  how about this  clever  at this point  they should know  all our radio ID numbers  yeah shouldn't they be  on file somewhere  you're right  and why do we have to  every 3 months 
[01:29:00]  ah whatever  this is too inside now  but we have to reset  our radios  every fucking 3 months  because they get rid  of VIP accounts  all the fucking time  yeah god forbid  you know  it's like you  Opie, Anthony, Jimmy  here's their ID numbers  never turn these radios off  thank you  I'm not even kidding you  when I tell you  I was paying  up until  months ago  am I still paying?  I was paying  for probably  6 subscriptions  my own  different people  for the house  for the  I was paying 
[01:29:30]  because  I just couldn't deal  with the problem  of trying to  fucking get it done  it was just cheaper  it was easier  to just pay  aggravation wise  for me to just go  fuck it  and then I would  call up  I'd call up  and be like  yeah  I wanna  connect  ok  well  this is  customer service  what's your name  well she ain't gonna  know who I am  she's out of the demo  hi  it's Anthony  call me  I need that  blah blah blah  thank you 
[01:30:00]  do you need  anything else  do you need  a channel guide  yeah  tell me  what channel  I'm on  I have no clue  did customer service  know the show  no  no  no  no I'm not even joking  they don't know the show  who the fuck does  the customer service  it's all outsourced  it's outsourced  I almost can't get mad  because it's a lot cheaper  why wouldn't you at least  educate them on who  the fucking shows are  cause they're probably  the same people that  when they're doing  customer service for this  like after 2 o'clock 
[01:30:30]  some boss comes  alright you're on  Dell now  you're on the Dell  customer service now  and 5 o'clock  yeah I wanna put in  some overtime  can I get on the  General Motors  fucking customer service  do you get your  credit card shut off  um  no they call me  sometimes and say  hey  mine gets shut off  constantly  because my  billing address  is LA  and I try to  explain to them  every fucking time  cause all of a sudden  that's your billing  address LA  cause everything  goes through  you know 
[01:31:00]  that's weird  why  cause that can  fuck you up  with addresses  and shit  yeah  if you wanna  deliver something  oh I have to  deliver to your house  you have to do  the two different  addresses  two different things  and sometimes  they don't like that  especially with big items  so every time  I use my credit card  somewhere new  they just shut it off  and I have to go  through customer service  and I go  you're looking at my  screen right now  can't you put some  kind of flags on there  like don't fucking  shut this guy's  credit card off  this easily  it drives me nuts  and then I get  someone  that's obviously 
[01:31:30]  not even with the  company  so I'm yelling  at these people  they don't care  it's just another  phone call  they're taking  I've had a few  instances where  I've bought  some high end  items at the  Apple store  over there  at Roosevelt  Field Mall  things like that  and they  call the check  you have to  or you have to  put the  verification thing  in there  and then  I'll go again  and pretty much  buy the same  kind of things  from the same  stores and stuff  and they're like  yeah there's a  problem  call us 
[01:32:00]  I call up  and it's like  did you make  this thing  could you just  take 10  minutes  it's like seconds  just look at my  record and see  what my spending  thing is  it's like  should you know  that this is  what I do  and they say  it's for your  security  it's not  it's a pain in the  ass  it's for their  security  they don't want  to be buying  someone else's  laptop and shit  because in the end  you don't have to  fucking pay for that  stuck with the shit  so it's a pain  in the ass  to you  alright whatever  so fucking 
[01:32:30]  turn on my  stupid radio  it was a bummer  that I couldn't  check out our  own channel  with the Joe  Rogan thing  this weekend  I miss us  a real bummer  wasn't able to  listen to that  so then I  listened to  Pearl Jam  I listened to  Lithium  Pearl Jam  Radio has  gotten old  though man  it's the same  fucking concert  over and over  again  I know it's  different dates  but after a  while  holy shit  how many  different versions  of elderly  woman behind  the counter  in a small town  can I listen to  oh god  and I love  Pearl Jam  there's none  none  I love Pearl Jam  but  I was thinking 
[01:33:00]  about  Eddie Vedder  must be bored  shitless  to be singing  these songs  can't find  a bit of  you see  you see  like  can't find  a virus  channel  you see  him singing  like nothing  man from  I don't know  2000  and then  you know  you get out  of your car  you get back  in  and then  2009  you hear him  doing nothing  man again  and  yeah  you gotta think  he's gotta be  bored  that's why  he made  his ukulele album  he's gotta be 
[01:33:30]  bored though  he's gotta make  believe he loves  these songs  still  he can't love  those songs  anymore  I think bands  can't love  their songs  that much  anymore  after years  and years  of doing it  like that  no way  I love it  I'm a fan  still  yes  but  put yourself  in Eddie Vedder's  body  and he's going  out on a stage  every night  singing the songs  he tries to adjust  it a little bit  here and there  and throw in  some covers  and things  but  it's gotta be  a boring  fucking life  on the stage  doing it  I think he's  having fun 
[01:34:00]  oh god  you think he  really has  passion  saying Jeremy  still  absolutely  yeah  I've seen  them over  a dozen  times  I've only  seen Jeremy  once  what do you  think  I think  he's gotta be  sick of some  of that shit  night after  night  but knowing  people  have to hear  the same  songs  in pretty much  the same  way  maybe  if it's a band  that literally  goes on tour  with the same  13 songs  and just plays  them night  after night  I could see  them getting  sick of that  but a band  like Pearl Jam  or Radiohead  or like 
[01:34:30]  Neil Young  I mean  you've discussed  you know  disappointing  the audience  but they switch  it up  every night  it's a different  set every night  Springsteen  Springsteen  like they  they take  advantage of  their catalog  you know  in what way  you think  that it's not  the same songs  every night  I celebrate  their entire  catalog  Pearl Jam  Radio  I couldn't get  through three  minutes of it  no  it's not my  I'm sure  it's fine  Elvis Radio  I can listen  I do like it  but I just  I just think  Eddie's gotta be 
[01:35:00]  bored  why do they call  it Pearl Jam  Radio  oh I get it  because they're  Pearl Jam  why do they call  it Elvis  because of  recognition  you're trying  to say  we're as big  as Elvis  no  but I'm  trying to say  that the name  of this show  would drive  traffic there  a lot more  than the name  the virus  yeah  well my point  and they won't  do it  I can't argue  the fact that  we're not  household names  I'm gonna be  cocky about it  but now that  we've been  with the company  for seven years  they had seven  year opportunity  to make it 
[01:35:30]  the Opie and  Anthony channel  and at this point  we would have been  more of a  household name  yeah  you gotta build  your product  right  you gotta build  it up  I was listening  calling it the  virus doesn't  build up anything  no  no it does not  and again  the name  in all the markets  that the show  is syndicated in  in Philly  you know  Boston  whatever  it's still  more recognizable  there than  the word  the virus  so it's like  it doesn't  make sense  we tried  though  they didn't  want to hear  it all  they didn't  Bob should  have tried  harder  they didn't 
[01:36:00]  want to hear  it  they don't  want to hear  it man  who said  no  they don't  they don't  want to  they don't  want to  build up  new brands  really  they want  to hire  brands  but they  don't want  to build  up new  brands  and I  think  that's  going to  bite some  people in  the ass  eventually  anyway  I was listening  to the  the 40s  channel  on the way  home  you're in  that right  age group  yeah  bring back  memories  you're in  your 40s  I meant  yes of course 
[01:36:30]  not that you're  from the  1940s  do you do  what I do  with that  channel  what  you know  these broads  were being  finger popped  and stuff  but they  make it  sound so  like  it was  romantic  romantic  well that  was a  romantic  that was  the whole  thing I  was getting  to  oh you  were  it was  like  they  was singing  about  like  New  York  City  and making  it sound  like  we take  the subway  uptown  and it's  like you  just picture  you and your  best gal  walking around  Harlem  and everything's  fine  you know  and it's 
[01:37:00]  like  it was  always for  a kiss  and she  gave me  a kiss  it's like  oh is that  what happened  you know  what that really  means man  yeah  he was  fucking  grabbing  the back  of that  Miss  Crabtree  hairdo  and just  fucking  that bun  that bun  on the back  of her head  holding it  like a doorknob  screwing her  head on his  fucking dick  but they called  it a kiss  yes yes  and that was  a kiss  but basically 
[01:37:30]  they're trying to  talk about how  great the blowjob  was  having a great  time in old  New York town  they call it  a New York town  like it's a little  village  watching the  bush carts  on Broadway  what  you know  some guys  now it's  some fucking  the new  Israelites  watching the  new Israelites  yell at me  cause I'm  white  that's great  watching some  fucking crooked  black guy  trying to sell  me a CD  but you know 
[01:38:00]  back then  some guy  had smelly  fucking  pussy fingers  as he's trying  to drink his  martini  oh yeah  yeah  but they were  talking about  how it was  all romantical  getting home  from the office  after a smack  on the secretary's  ass 800 times  right  sitting in some  bar in  Manhattan  yeah  they were  good all day  they were always  fucking  always  it was a hoot  though  listen to that  shit  the words  the songs  stuff they  tried to rhyme  it was real  dumb  and uh  but yeah  very innocent  very romantic 
[01:38:30]  and they had  they had the  Andrew sisters  like that  that weird  vocalization  that they don't  do anymore  yeah yeah  very over the top  affected  voices  listen to this  makes me luckier  than throwing a  seven  takes me nearer  to heaven  than anyone's  allowed to do  terrible  when your heart  is talking  I feel like  I'm walking  on a cloud  I know what  that means  she wants  to in the  shitter  yeah yeah  this is  absolutely  anal 
[01:39:00]  but they have  to talk  in code  yeah yeah  like it puts  me on a cloud  with you  that's the  pillow her face  is in  it puts me  on a cloud  and there's  a log nearby  that's because  she wasn't ready  for anal  she wants to be  floating because  she's not going  to be sitting  anytime soon  you do it  right  right guys  right  this is horrendous  right  I want to hear  this in the  Overlook Hotel  playing fucking  throwing a ball  against the wall  Tuesday  getting some  avocado on me 
[01:39:30]  yeah while my  fucking skinny  wife is upstairs  with her fucking  Adam's apple  period blood  coming out of the  fucking elevator  she's the one  we wanted to  kill her  a lot of  instrumental parts  in this too  Kevin from Connecticut  grabbing those  pointy missile tits  yes  those fucking  bras that were  like fucking  yeah missile  did you even  get to touch  the nipple  through the bra  back then  you wouldn't  feel anything  over bra  back then  was useless 
[01:40:00]  yeah  you were just  feeling cones  yeah  the traffic cone  right  and to get  under that  bra was  crazy  because the  straps  and the  snaps on the  back  little latches  you feel like  the sweat  underneath  I hate  bra sweat  bra sweat  when you lift  a bra  and there's  a fucking  coating of  sweat  it's like  I hate  fucking  underarm  tits  you want  to dab  this with  a tissue  before I  lick it  smell your  fucking  awful  dirty  cloth

[01:46:00]  of a white  only neighborhood  just like the one  i used to know  i think that's what  they were really  singing about  yeah it was either  sex  or uh  the blacks  and their  their hatred thereof  my son  the black eyed  child  shouldn't have talked  while daddy  had a headache  daddy's liver  hurts from drinking  so he'll beat his 
[01:46:30]  family a lot  doesn't even rhyme  but who gives a turkey  that is great man  break time  chop chop  so i want to know  about the  poconos  i wasn't here  yesterday  i was celebrating  my birthday  your birthday  birthday 
[01:47:00]  i don't feel like  working on my  birthday anymore  no it  that's a good day  to take off  yeah you just  kind of chill out  and do your own  thing but um  so i was kind of  bummed because i  wanted to i want to  hear about the  poconos experience  from you  yeah  and i want to  talk to jimmy  about his  kareem abdul  jabbar picture  as well  kareem  lots went on  yeah yeah  it was uh  i saw your  videos  yeah  from poconos  uh speedway  is it called  yeah  poconos raceway  poconos raceway  i popped up  two videos so far 
[01:47:30]  i got i got a lot  of like in car  footage and uh  outside uh  guy was really  cool uh  bunch of  everybody down  there was cool  they took my  my uh canon  camera and went  on top of the  the score tower  oh no kidding  and videoed from  there and uh  oh wow  we're gonna see  that soon  get the entire  track yeah  oh right on  so i'll keep  editing and  popping uh  videos up  right  but i put one  together of uh  one of the  in car cameras  um and one of  the cameras that  are on me  uh and they  were really cool  with that too  like yeah yeah  we'll hook you  up they're getting 
[01:48:00]  clamps and shit  and clamping  my cameras to the  roll bar  they were just  really nice to  you  yeah really  really cool  and uh  yeah at first  you go you  you go there  and and you  start thinking  to yourself  this can't be  allowed  somehow  i'm kind of  confused by that  and it's crazy  and i know  we're lucky enough  to probably get  to do things  that other people  don't get to do  because of our  wealth and fame  our wealth and fame  there you go jimmy  wealth and fame  we do downplay it 
[01:48:30]  but sometimes we get  to do some things  that maybe other  people aren't allowed  to do so you know  why was that one  of those situations  because you're rich  and famous  and that the  no anyone can do this  no anyone can do this  amazing it's uh  the uh  fucking amazing  stock car racing  experience at  uh pocono raceway  and uh you  you take a class  you take a quick  uh class about  uh a half hour  forty minutes  and they they  let you in on uh 
[01:49:00]  what what the  various signals mean  the flags  um the shape  of the track  the different  degrees of bank  on the turn  and things like that  and then they take  you all out  in these two  big vans  where you slowly  drive the track  and they'll show you  some of the markers  on the on the course  and uh how to cut  the turns  but doesn't the track  look like one big  circle  uh no no  it's so big  you actually see shit  that is different  let me tell you something  the track is so big  that you can't see it  from any other part 
[01:49:30]  of the track  like when you're  driving on part  of the track  you can't look  and say oh the rest  of the track's  over there  right  it's huge  it's two and a half  miles  wow  okay  uh it's a try  it's like a tri-oval  um but none of the  straightaways are the  same length  and none of the curves  are the same radius  or the same banking  okay  so it  every everything  you do is a little  different  um as you're driving  it and it's  giant  it's just fucking  huge  so um  you get taken 
[01:50:00]  around  they take around  in the van  and then uh  you get in a car  with one of the  pros  and you're sitting  in the passenger seat  they got pros  just hanging out  up there  they're just drivers  they're just sitting  there like  hey how you doing  what's up  by the way  listen closely  this is not like  a commercial  or an infomercial  I really wanted to  know about the  experience  so yeah  they're lucking out  here and getting  a nice commercial  out of the deal  but I really need  to know this  because it was  so fucking cool  so they just got  race car drivers  just hanging out 
[01:50:30]  there  yeah  for this experience  for people  yep  so you hop in  the passenger seat  with one of these  guys  and go around  the track  three times  and during that  three times  this guy's talking  he's driving  like a maniac  but he you know  it's all safe  he knows what  he's doing  but he's talking  and he's like  you know  and come up  on this corner  you're gonna want  to dip down  and see the apex  marker over there  that's where you  can hit it  and come back  out of the wall  and he's  he's just talking 
[01:51:00]  and giving hand signals  during this whole time  because a lot of times  you can't even hear  what he's fucking saying  and then after the  three laps  you get out  and you get into  your own car  get the fuck  out of here  you take off  with the  one of the pros  the instructor  in the lead car  and then  you have  you behind him  and another person  behind you  or vice versa  someone could be  in front of you  behind you  whatever  the three of you  take off  they do it 
[01:51:30]  in groups of three  and then you follow  the instructor  around the track  and every lap  he goes a little faster  you know  you gotta  hold your line  better in the corners  come out  you're like  right against the wall  when you come out  of the turns  and then by the last  couple of laps  you are fucking  flying  and if the person  in front of you  isn't holding position  and starts  like getting scared  of falling back  they'll hold a flag  out for him  that he's supposed  to dip down  on the track 
[01:52:00]  and now you  could shoot  past them  and then he  gets behind you  so that you're  not being held up  so you're having  a good time  being able to  drive as fast  as you possibly can  were you worried  you were gonna  hit the wall  or anything like that  no and that's  where the driving  with the driver  comes in handy  the first three laps  you take as a passenger  right  because I think  if you just hop  in the car  you're not sure  because you're used  to driving  like you drive  your regular car  and everything  you've been taught  and every instinct  you have  from driving  your regular car  gets thrown 
[01:52:30]  out the fucking  window  when you're  gassing it  toward a fucking  curve  what do you  normally do  you let off  you hit the brake  you're like  no  you stay in this  fucking thing  you roll down  into the corner  and then you  shoot out of the  corner  and right against  the wall  and then just  pound the pedal  back down  and you're  flying down  one of the  straightaways  but until you're  in a car  with the instructor  doing that  you gotta think  you're gonna hit  the wall  but when you see 
[01:53:00]  that he's going  really fast  and not hitting  the wall  and I know  he's a pro  and stuff  but at least  the car  can do it  you know  that the  ass end  isn't gonna  come out  on you  if you're  driving  the right  way  and hugging  the line  so when you  get in alone  and you start  driving  yeah when you  hit that first  curve  you're kind of  like  a little tentative  but then by  the last few  laps  you're just  you're screaming  into the corners  the g-forces  are pushing you  you're literally  getting beat up  in your seat  like you feel 
[01:53:30]  you're constantly  bam bam  just getting thrown  around  oh you can't  do that  no no  you gotta hold  on to that  fucking thing  I would be the guy  that hits the wall  you gotta hold  on to that thing  Jimmy would you  be able to do  this  no  I mean slower  sure  signals and beep  then you might  as well just  go on the road  that's what I  would do  slow on booze  enjoy the road  that's sober  but when you're  there  it's  I'd have coffee  coffee  coffee in one end  I was telling 
[01:54:00]  Danny how  fucked up it would  be if you  got a picture  of you  texting  be like  hey guess  what I'm  doing now  that'd be great  texting as you're  driving  170 miles an hour  in the videos  you've posted  so far  I see the  concentration  you're not  fucking around  totally focused  on what you're  doing  where you're  going  you gotta  constantly  watch  your  turns  there  are a few  markers  that are out  there  that let  you know  like  and the  professional  was saying  back off 
[01:54:30]  or catch up  to the guy  in front of you  keep about  four car lengths  between the cars  and when you go  into the corner  it goes  here's the red  cone  this is where  you're gonna  dip way down  and hit  some of these  markers that are  on the course  and then the apex  marker is a green  cone at the apex  of the turn  where you're in  as low as possible  on the track  and then you come  out of that  punch the fucking  gas  and now come  back up  and then right  against the wall  for the straightaway  how is this legal  that's what I was 
[01:55:00]  saying when I  drove in  I'm driving in  and I'm watching  these cars go around  but how is this  legal  I'm driving into  the course  and I'm looking  going  I can't believe  as you look  at the cars  from the outside  they're going  like  like so fast  you're just  looking going  I am not  going to be  doing that  wow  and then you  realize  once you're  in the car  that's what  you're doing  you're the guy  now on the  track  going  how fast  how does it  sound  can you do  that sounding 
[01:55:30]  it's amazing  how that is  exactly  what it  sounds like  it's crazy  it's crazy  how fast  can you go  the stock  cars  you could do  about 170  if you're  taking the  corners right  you're coming  out of them  right  you're punching  the fucking  gas  that feels  fucking fast  I was doing  170 in the  Shelby  I didn't get  up to 170  in the stock  car  mine wouldn't  go to  I think  I got a 
[01:56:00]  slower car  I was  punching it  on the  straightaways  and I  couldn't  get past  like 7500  RPM  and you  know  other people  are getting  7908  8000  which is  you know  you're hitting  in the  160s  something like  that  when you hit  the gas  for the  first time  how does  that feel  it just  shoots  forward  when you  have the  clutch down  and you  just give it  a couple  of shots  the car  kind of  rolls a little  bit over  and you 
[01:56:30]  just hear  like  it's an  explosion  there's no  muffler on  this fucking  thing  and then  you put  it in  gear  you don't  want to  be the  guy that  conks it  out on  pit road  you don't  want to  be that  guy  so you  know  give it  a little  gas  ease the  clutch  out  and you  have to  be in  fourth  gear  they tell  you  be in  fourth  gear  by the  time  you hit  the track  be in  fourth  fucking  gear  so  you're  going  through  the  gears  and the  first  turn  I was  very  tentative  just  kind of  feeling  the car  out  feeling  the  steering 
[01:57:00]  the gas  shit  like  that  you  don't  touch  the  brake  you  never  touch  the  brake  until  you're  rolling  back  into  the  pit  at  the  end  of  this  thing  and  you're  hitting  170 miles  an hour  at a time  but you never  touch the  brake  you never  hit the  fucking  brakes  I can't  even pretend  I can't  do that  sometimes  I do  65  the windows  open  the breeze  in my  face  that's  all I  need  that's  all I  need  sober  slow  on booze  enjoy  the road  but you  won't do  a zip  line  no I 
[01:57:30]  never said  I wouldn't  do a  zip  line  it just  didn't  interest  me as  much  as  doing  the  ATVs  when I  was  down  in  Mexico  but  it's  something  I think  you get  a little  more  comfortable  as you're  going  through it  when you  first pull  up  and look  at the  cars  and how  fast  they're  going  and you  get  intimidated  by the  fact  that you've  watched  stock car  racing  and how  fucking  insane  it is  but when  you go  through  the  course  and then  you sit 
[01:58:00]  there  with the  guy  even  going  around  the  track  in the  van  you  kind  of  get  the  feel  of  how  steep  the  banks  are  or  how  steep  they're  not  and then  once  you're  in  the  car  you  really  at that  point  have  no  fucking  choice  you have  to  keep  up  they'll  hold  a  sign  out  if  you're  not  keeping  up  with  your  pace  car  they pull  sign  out  like the  flag  stand  you gotta  look at  the  flag  stand  every  time  you  go  by  and  the  guy  will  hold  the  sign  out  saying  close  it  up  and  if  you  don't  close  it  up  they'll  hold  the  pass  flag  out  you get  passed  if  you fall  too far  back  they have 
[01:58:30]  to send  another  instructor  out  so you  can  follow  him  at  a  slower  speed  or  if  you  freak  out  you  just  gotta  wave  your  hand  like  this  and  pull  into  the  pit  and  just  be  yelled  at  by  your  friends  do  you  know  who  you're  gonna  love  tomorrow  fucking  Brian  Johnson  oh  oh  he's a  racer  he  races  for  real  maniac  yeah  he's  like  a  fucking  car  fanatic  yeah  yeah  I'm  reading  his  book  I  could  not  stop  thinking  of  you  but  I  mean  all  these  weird 
[01:59:00]  fucking  the  same  things  you're  talking  about  this  fucking  high  from  it's  amazing  the other  thing  so you're  in the  stock  car  and  you  know  you  explain  all  that  and  then  you  get  to  take  your  Shelby  out  yeah  yeah  then I  was  that  fuck  you  up  because  it's  completely  different  that  I  was  more  nervous  with  the  Shelby  because  first  of all  it's  my  car  secondly  these  stock  cars  are  made  to  just  turn  left  I  mean  obviously  they  turn  right  but  they're  not  made 
[01:59:30]  to  race  go  around  that  track  my  car  is  made  to  turn  both  ways  drive  on  the  street  and  stuff  but  it's  also  been  modified  to  go  very  fast  and  the  suspension  has  been  modified  to  hang  in  on  the  turns  and  stuff  so  I  wasn't  taking  the  turns  as  fast  but  I  was  going  faster  in  the  straights  than  I  was  going  in  the  stock  car  and  that  one  clip  of  the  stretch 
[02:00:00]  that  trying  to  get  maybe  you  know  a  little  bit  of  a  burst  of  speed  get  up  to  120  and  then  you  gotta  back  off  you  gotta  worry  about  the  cops  other  traffic  but  that  really  is  nothing  it's  a lot  it's  twice  the  legal  limit  crazy  and  so  is  my  alcohol  level  at  the  time  but 
[02:00:30]  there's  too much  shit  to worry  about  so  when  you  get  on  the  track  to  have  the  super  charger  just  humming  the  entire  time  you're  driving  down  the  straight  aways  is  different  than  just  punching  it  on  the  highway  hearing  it  go  and  then  it's  done  so  when  you  come  out  of  turn  three  come  down  to  the  straight  away  and  it's  like  one  of  the  longest  straight  aways  in  any  NASCAR  track  is  Pocono  and 
[02:01:00]  you  come  out  of  that  and  just  you're  that's  like  the  coolest  fucking  thing  that  was  my  mortgage  going  by  it  just  to  hear  that  fucking  thing  and  to  watch  the  turbo  boost  gauge  just  go  fucking 
[02:01:30]  flying  up to  like  25  pounds  and  the  fuel  pressure  gauge  goes  up  and  you  know  you're  just  dumping  valuable  gasoline  into  nothingness  into  going  around  in  a  circle  people  are  actually  mad  you're  repeating  this  I'm  sure  you added  some  new  shit  yeah  fuck  it  who cares  I'm  curious  about  this  damn  there's  new  people  listening  to  sorry  man  I  just  people  call  me  a  pussy  I'm  not  going  to  fucking  fake  it  I  don't  think  I  could  do  that  there  are  plenty  of  things  I  would  do  I  I  wouldn't  parachute  I  wouldn't  bungee  jump  would  you  fight  a  Frenchman  underwater  I  wouldn't  fight  a  Frenchman 
[02:02:00]  underwater  I  don't  like  roller  coasters  I  don't  go on  fucking  roller  coasters  that go  upside  down  you  ain't  get me  on  one  of  those  but  I'll  hop  in  a  fucking  car  and do  180  miles  an  hour  I  absolutely  would  do  it  but  I  would  be  slow  guy  yeah  oh  yeah  I  definitely  would  be  slow  give it  a little  juice  you  get  a 
[02:02:30]  little  more  balls  the more  you go  around  the track  you start  thinking  I can  do  this  I'll  stick  to  the  lines  and shit  like that  is it  hard  to run  into the  wall  I know  it's a  dumb  fucking  childish  question  the handling  is really  good on  these  things  so when  you come  out  of the  turns  it's a  natural  feel  you're not  feeling  like  if you  didn't  go up  to that  wall  it would  feel  weird  you'd  feel  like  about  a half  a car  length 
[02:03:00]  half  a car  length  as you're  going  over  100  miles  an  hour  yeah  and the  shit  flying by  on that  side  is  horrific  there's  the big  fence  so if  you hit  the wall  your car  doesn't go  over  into the  woods  and then  there's  these  trees  that they  planted  that go  by  like  yeah  those  trees  on the  side  God bless  them  but how  is this  legal  it's  you know  what it  is  you took  a half  hour  course  they're  very  they are  really  safe  like  they  make  sure  they tell 
[02:03:30]  you  more  shit  could  happen  to you  in the  pit  area  than  on  the  track  like  if  you  start  sliding  your rear  end  starts  sliding  out  on  you  don't  try  to  save  it  what's  the  normal  reaction  you have  when  you  skid  out  turn  into  the  skid  if  this  happens  because  you're  only  turning  left  so  your  ass  end  is  going  to  fly  out  to  the  right  so  it's  like  your  instinct  would  be  to  turn  right  don't  do  that  because  you're  going to  hit  the  wall  instead  he goes  just 
[02:04:00]  let it  go  spin  out  spin  into  the  grass  in  the  infield  and  someone  will  come  and  get  you  spin  out  spin  out  if  that  happens  they  haven't  had  many  spin  outs  at  all  that's  people  that  they're  very  safety  conscious  they've  logged  over  I think  it's a  couple  of  million  miles  doing  this  and  never  had  any  serious  injuries  did you  get a 
[02:04:30]  good night  sleep  before  you  did  this  or  was  it  your  regular  weekend  self  we decided  to stay  in the  Poconos  so  they put  us up  after  this  yeah  so  they put  us up  no  I mean  going  into  this  and  then  oh  the night  before  yeah  I think  I had  a normal  kind  of night  sleep  yeah  but  you gotta  be alert  I knew  not to  fucking  be pounding  the night  before  yeah  they were  really cool  and they  want to  have us  because in  the infield  that track  is the 
[02:05:00]  big  tri-oval  and then  in the  middle  of the  tri-oval  is a  shitload  of  different  road  courses  where  you know  lefts and  rights  and shit  like that  and they  have these  go-karts  that do  like 50  miles an  hour  and they  want to  have  like all  of us  go down  there  and  get on  these  go-karts  and race  the  go-karts  which I  think would  be hysterically  fun  would you do  that Jimmy  the go-karts  yes  yeah that  would be  but I  don't  speed  so you  would do  it's like  my bumper sticker  says  sober 
[02:05:30]  slow on  booze  enjoy the  road  yeah I  would do  it  you'd be  doing hand  signals around  the turns  you don't  think that  you're on  that track  and do  60  of course  I would  of course  you would  waving  slowly  at people  I would  yell  hi  and you'd  hear me  fucking  brewers  fucking  making him  the whole  way  brewers  walking  down  his ass  out  his ass  is against  oh  he's smearing  it  he can walk  down the  hallway  with his  pants  around his  ankles  now he's  pointing and

[02:06:30]  do something  like that  no see  I wouldn't  be happy  about it  but I  would do  that  yes  I wouldn't  do that  I definitely  would do  that  I don't  like  falling  things  my girlfriend  did that  I was  fucking  so  nervous  that's  crazy  you were  nervous  were you  all nervous  I was like  please  let it  snap  yeah  no I  was very  nervous  were you  sweating  and stuff  were your palms  all sweaty  it cost a hundred  bucks I almost  didn't pay for her  to do it  why didn't you  do it  I couldn't  even though  I knew  it would be  wait this is  how it goes  I don't know  oh it's crazy 
[02:07:00]  it's a decelerator  right  yeah  so they drop  you down  and then the  closer you get  to the ground  yeah  you decelerate  but  let me see  it's fucking  horrifying  when you stand  out there  on the ledge  before you  jump  your feet  are over  the edge  that's crazy  and you just  step off  and you fall  900 feet  let me see  this video  let me see  if I would  do this  they use  these in  Hollywood  these decelerator  rigs to make  it look like  the actors  are falling  I'm gonna be  very honest  CGI out the  cable  so it's  the same  kind of rig  I'm gonna be  very honest  would I do  this 
[02:07:30]  hold on  Mark  we're watching  a video  and then  now it's  so you  yeah I  would do  that  see it  looks  but when  you're standing  on the  it looks  fun  there  but when  you're  standing  on that  fucking  edge  I looked  out the  window  it's  horrifying  that's crazy  I would  I would do  that  I'd be  scared  I'm not  a big fan  of falling  I'd be  afraid that  the cord  would snap  back and  yank me  back up  and hang  me up  would you  bungee cord 
[02:08:00]  no  no bungee  why would  I  there's no  reason  I'm gonna  go down  come back  and go  down  I'm already  down  I don't  need to  do that  I'm  here  what am I  gonna go  on a trip  and ride  up  I'm here  look at  this  you want  to jump  from this  height  look at  that  I saw  how he  he stepped  over the  edge  I think  I could  do that  I couldn't  look at  this  but I  would never  skydive  no  oh my god  that looks  crazy  yeah  no  what if it broke  thanks mark 
[02:08:30]  you're dead  but that's the  trade center  that's what  people were  seeing when  they jumped  out of the  trade center  I know  see that's  what I  can't get  out of my  mind  that's how  high you  are  someone is  saying that  you finally  realize that  NASCAR is  actually a  sport and  has respect  for what  they do  I always  had respect  for what  they do  what are you  it's easy  to joke  about it  I did  20 miles  on that  track  20 miles  and those  motherfuckers  do 500  miles  and they  don't get  to fucking  stop 
[02:09:00]  I guess  the most  you could  do down  there  is  80 miles  at 20  mile increments  and then  you stop  in the pits  for a little  while  and then  you go  back out  but  500  fucking  miles  in that  car  I  don't  know  how  they're  not  walking  out  a  shaky  fucking  mess  because  going into  those  turns  I was  grinding  my teeth  and trying  to hold  that wheel  and keep 
[02:09:30]  it steady  your teeth  hurt  my jaw  was hurting  because it's  one of those  things where  you're like  come on  hold it  it's like  you drive  home  yeah  exactly  except I'm  not yelling  the n  word  I know  it's real  I don't want  to come  off like  like a  doubting  Thomas  we got  Jimmy Fallon  coming down  the hall  he's not  for us yet  I think  we're after  he's got  no no  he just  Roland just  popped his  head in  I said  bring him 
[02:10:00]  in  you can't  miss Roland  popping his  head in  that's for sure  a big thing  I thought it  was an eclipse  his head's big  right  it's like an  engorged  tick  I say  all this  while he's  out  and can't  listen  god  I don't  know  if I  can do  that  that'd  be fun  but they  want us  to do  the go  karts  during the  summer  head out  there  we'll all  hop in  those little  go karts  and race  because then  you all  go out on  the track  at once  and just  race  spin out  I'll lose  because I'll  go slowly  I don't 
[02:10:30]  do speed  things  no  no I don't  believe in  them  yeah well  they're true  there was  another thing  I was watching  online last night  there's something  called the  texas mile  and it's a  mile long  course  and people  go as fast  as they can  go  and I've  seen cars  doing like  250 miles  an hour  250 down  this track  it's insane  what regular  guys  yeah anyone  who wants  can go  on this  texas  it's called  the texas mile  hi jimmy  what's going on  are you doing  man  we're just yapping  about autos 
[02:11:00]  and driving  fast  just so you  know the  conversation  Anthony went  to Poconos  raceway  over the  weekend  and got to  driving  in a stock  car  after a half  hour lesson  it's great  wait this is  crazy  yeah you go  down there  you take a  little course  real quick  and then you  get on the  track  and you  get in a  real NASCAR  stock car  and drive it  around like  170 miles  an hour  were you nervous  this is crazy  no you  kind of  I get nervous  playing video  games like that  I play the  video game  I crash  it's too much  to me 
[02:11:30]  being in a  real car  actually  maybe get  hurt  you kind of  the nerves  go away  through the  course of  the day  and shit  like that  we got  anybody else  on here  today  and then I  got to take  my own car  though  because I  got a  shelby  mustang  gt500  and they  let me  take that  out on the  track  I got one  of these  new video  games  like a  gran turismo  for a ps3  and someone  sent me a  steering wheel  and a gas  pedal  to hook up  to your  game so much  better  my wife  was like  this is  insane  you're 36  you're like 
[02:12:00]  an idiot  I got plastic  gas pedals  and a steering  wheel  I'm looking  next to  a baby  where baby's  the baby's  got the same  fake  whatever  there's Jimmy  beeping the  horn  it's a floating  steering wheel  so it's not  even attached  to anything  I'm not even  driving a  mini cooper  because that's  an option  you're an idiot  Jimmy  you should  do this  for your  TV show  look at this  you're in a  stock car  it's complete  insanity  isn't that crazy  it was in the  Poconos 
[02:12:30]  yeah  Pocono Raceway  Jimmy  there's nobody  in the car  with him  they say  alright  take the car  out  have fun  this is what  the video game  looks like  except it's a  video game  but this is  frightening  but this is it  that's his camera  you only get one  car in this game  and you're not  drunk driving  in your video games  I mean  this is insane  you're getting  thrown around  you never realize  how fast are you  going  about 160  are you out  of your mind  I would never  do this  it's so much  fun  and then you come  out of the turn  and just gas it 
[02:13:00]  do you know  how to drive  you're a good  driver clearly  no I'm a very  impatient  horrid driver  in the city  but you took  lessons  how long  did you learn  about 30 minutes  in a classroom  with a driver  and then they  give you these  600 horsepower  NASCAR  I mean I don't  see airbags  I don't see  anything that I need  the safety equipment  is pretty much  the harness  and they strap  your head back  so you don't  break your neck  if something happens  once anyone  goes you might  break your neck  doing this  I don't want to do  this  this is so you 
[02:13:30]  have use of your  feet in your old age  that's nice  that's always a good  thing  he just described  this for over  a half hour  I said probably  20 times  how is this legal  like how are you  allowed  how is that  legal  well I think  once you walk  onto their property  and sign a piece  of paper  if anything happens  hey it's your fault  we don't care  like a guy  could come up  to you  that owns  the place  and shoot you  in the head  and your family  can do nothing  about it  or if you're  struck by a bolt  of lightning  is that the 
[02:14:00]  honeymoon type  of place  I think they have  a couple of those  places  remember that  there used to be  a big deal  Mount Airy Lodge  as a matter of fact  after me and my  buddy Danny  did this  we went in a big  champagne glass  bathtub  bubble bath  and just watched  each other  celebrated  that's a manly  thing to do  that was the  heart shaped bed  used to vibrate  when I was a kid  I remember the  commercials  the beautiful  Mount Airy Lodge  oh here it is  horseback riding  and you went  recently though 
[02:14:30]  within the last  10 years  within the last  10 years  they give you  a swimming pool  in your room  now right  in the shape  of a heart  this is an  actual swimming  pool  it's one of  the options  it's a rectangular  swimming pool  but you walk  in it's not  that big  and you just  know so much  fucking went  on in this  pool  it's just like  god I hope  you know what's  grosser the bed  or the pool  yeah  everything was  horrible  whatever you look  at you  oh someone  had sex  on that  yeah yeah  you take in  a black light 
[02:15:00]  it looks like  a Peter Max  painting  all over the  room  just glowing  it's horrible  it looks like  a Jackson Pollock  yeah  the white  over here  yeah gross  I was daring  my girlfriend  to look in  the skimmer  for the pool  you don't want  to see what  you're going to  find  there's no treason  here but it's  full of something  welcome to your  room  it doesn't  filter work  it looked like  someone dropped  a toupee  in there  it really was  that took the  romance out of  it but yeah  we went there  and it was  the saddest part 
[02:15:30]  was going to  dinner and they  have this kind  of family dining  thing kind of  in a dining room  setting so you  sit at this  picnic table  looking thing  and we were  there like  goofing around  just drinking  and Louis  Black was  playing there  so we were  watching  was Louis  doing the  Poconos  yeah he was  doing the  Poconos  how great is that  that really  made me happy  that makes you  happy  champagne  we got it  I see you all  in your glasses  oh he must have  been miserable  the only bathtub  I have is in  the shape of  all the hearts  I hate romance  I have a clogged 
[02:16:00]  artery  are you having  fun than kill  your face  Mr. Saturday Night  Lines  tell your face  he's the greatest  there was a  couple there  that was all  like big wide  eyed and stuff  so my girl  leans over  she goes  so where are  you from  and they were  from Iowa  they had driven  from Iowa  to Poconos  Mount Dairy  Lodge  for their  honeymoon  it was  they had  just got  yeah we just  got married  and we're here  you chose to 
[02:16:30]  do this  to do this  okay sir  we're gonna do  some horseback  riding  you couldn't do  that in Iowa  seriously  I would think  you could probably  do some  horseback riding  in Iowa  I mean travel  is not the most  fun thing in the  world but you  can kind of go  anywhere now  yeah yeah  they're not that  expensive  good drive to  that William Shatner  website  whatever he has  some good deals  price line  price line  how are you  you have to  leave a thank you  note  oh well look at 
[02:17:00]  that  Jim Norton  is amazing  Jim Norton  is the master  he is the best  we just saw you  on TV with  this sweater  thing  yeah I made  a prediction  I was like  Jimmy Fallon  will come in  here with a  white shirt  with black  or brownish  stripes  and everyone  was amazed  until they saw  you go on TV  I knew it wasn't  taped  that's pretty good  embarrassing  like a mime  it's like a  French mime  it is very  French  you should have  a beret  a little pencil  mustache  yeah yeah yeah  artsy this morning  you have to be 
[02:17:30]  in shape to pull  that off too  you have to be  in shape to pull  that off  because it's  stripes and white  stripes are supposed  to be going up  and down  I disagree  really  you're in shape  is what he's  saying  you can pull  it off  I'm saying  I'm tired  right now  I'm not in shape  really  no  no it's just  it's that  rule that makes  you think I'm in shape  I'm totally not in shape  is it an XL  yeah  oh there you go  absolutely  I'm treating it  I'm treating it  like it's a medium  if people don't  understand why  stripes are kind  of a thing  that can show  your fat  look at those  things  you ever see  where they have 
[02:18:00]  to show  space in the  universe  and how gravity  acts on it  they make that  grid  that's exactly  what happens  with stripes  you look like  oh I see  where the  gravity is  I see where  the beer belly  I can see if I  released a marble  where it would  spin  right around  your belly  I see what's  going on there  yeah no yeah  I'm going around  I'm plugging this  thank you notes  yes I've been  keeping up on  your tweets  you're a good  tweeter  yeah 
[02:18:30]  I like it  because you have  funny tweets  and you also  you play little  games with people  you let people  get involved  hashtag games  I like that  yeah the hashtag  games are fun  the king of the hashtag  yeah  we'd like to just  get as social  as we can  with our show  yeah  you know  are you still  enjoying the twitter  yeah  yeah  it's fun  my problem is  after like  and I don't even  have to be drunk  half a beer  and my inhibition  level goes down  90% 
[02:19:00]  and I'll be like  yeah you  said it  oh you gotta  hide it  yeah yeah  you really have to  think twice  hide your kids  hide your wife  hide your phone  hide the phone  hide the phone  lock up the phone  you could really  pop in some  career enders  oh totally  you should have to  blow into a tube  before you twitter  right  I mean  John Mayer  right  was told  by his people  said you can't  have twitter  you're not allowed  to be on twitter  is that why  Miley Cyrus  dumped hers too  I wonder if they  were afraid of  what they were  going to say  I think she was  just on salve 
[02:19:30]  she didn't know  what was going on  she ate her phone  she didn't know  what it was  she thought it was  melting in her hand  actually logged out  of her twitter  my mistake  but yeah  it is a very  dangerous thing  I mean it's hard  it was hard enough  in the past  just texting a  friend  and the next  morning going  dude I'm sorry  I texted that  but now you're  texting the world  that you're an  asshole  yeah yeah  you have to  watch it  I remember  I got thrown  out of a  pizzeria in 
[02:20:00]  New York  and I just  got so mad  and I tweeted  about it  I went off  how did you  get thrown  out of a  why did they  throw you out  it's a silliest  story  you're a very  nice man  you're too  nice to be  thrown out  anywhere  in my life  I went out  with my  friends  and they were  doing a pizza  tasting thing  so I went on  a pizza tasting  thing  so I went  and I didn't  realize that  my quotes  or whatever  they write  for New York  magazine  so I went 
[02:20:30]  out and we  had this pizza  and they go  I don't like  this pizza  and I was  actually sticking  up for it  I go  it's not fair  to compare  this pizza  to another  pizza  because this  is almost  like a Ritz  cracker  with sauce  and cheese  on it  which by the  way sounds  pretty good  I like  English muffin  pizzas  I don't  snob  but anyways  they wrote  that  and I guess  the owner  didn't like  it  and read  that I  wrote this  review  and I walk  in  my brother-in-law  was there  when he had  his baby  with him  the baby  sleeping  in the  stroller  so I walk  in  I sit down  and the girl 
[02:21:00]  comes over  and she goes  I can't serve  you  you have to  leave  and she's  smiling  which makes  me even  more mad  oh man  they were just  waiting for you  to fuck  she loved it  she loved it  couldn't wait  to do this  and I was like  so I started  joking  so I go  okay good  I'll leave  too  let's leave  together  let's go  somewhere else  let's go  to a different  pizzeria  or whatever  she goes  no I'm  serious  you gotta  leave  and I was like  my wife came  my wife was 
[02:21:30]  there  and this baby  is sleeping  and I go  are you serious  what are you  talking  she goes  you know  what you did  you know  what you did  and I go  I don't know  what's going  on  could you  explain to my  wife  this isn't  sexual  I had nothing  I've never  met you before  but you really  screwed up my  marriage  you know  the review  in New York  magazine  you know  wow  and I go  I didn't even  know  so I was so  mad  and I just  tweeted out  screw this  place 
[02:22:00]  good  don't ever  go  it's more  advertised  for this  dumb  place  that's bad  advertising  all press  is not good  press  when you're  trashing it  good for you  but they want  to go to the  place that  Fallon thought  sucked  they just showed  him  yeah exactly  yeah  I was so  mad  yeah  I was like  but you're  here  did you ever  go back in  I never went  back in  but you know  what's fun  is that I  could get  delivery  you could  I guess  if I really  wanted that  wrist cracker  crap piece  but you don't  want them to  ever be on  to you  know that  it's you  because you  know  there's a 
[02:22:30]  Grimaldi's  now in the  limelight  now it's a  mall  a mall  it's a  shopping mall  you could  probably still  find ecstasy  underneath  like produce  people walk  in like  dude I  threw up  over there  now they're  selling you  know hunter  boots  with the  limelight  where is that  that's on  6th and  the old church  that is a  limelight  that's a  mall  that's not  a mall  20th and  6th I  think  oh yeah  I should go  there  there were  a few  complaints  they have  Grimaldi's  pizza  like Brooklyn 
[02:23:00]  good  Grimaldi's  is really  good  so that's  there now  I'm so  excited  John's Pizza  I used to  go there  on Pop Lock  John's is  phenomenal  there's a  place in  Brooklyn  called  Motorino  it's  that  number  one  it's  John's is  like number  two I  believe  Motorino  this place  like the  secret to  the pizza  which is  what these  guys were  talking about  is  no it's  the  how hot  is the  oven  so if  the oven  is like  900 degrees  it should  take you  only like  two minutes  to cook  the pizza  right  you throw  it in  seriously  it's  like  microwave  it's  fast  it's  like a 
[02:23:30]  so but  then they  pull it  in the  little  burnt  you have  a couple  burnt  crust  you know  bubbles  there  I was  stupid  because we  went to  John's Pizza  and I  like  pasta  and I  saw  spaghetti  on the  menu  I'm  like  I  want  spaghetti  why would  you do  that  if  you're  at  the  number  one  pizza  place  in  all  of  the  spaghetti  and their  spaghetti  sucked  their meatballs  were awful  and then I  had a slice  of the  pizza  I'm  like  of 
[02:24:00]  course  that's  why  you  go  here  don't  order  anything  else  then you  go to  the  pasta  place  and you  get a slice  of pizza  I know  Jimmy doesn't  have a lot  of time  here  you're a very  busy man  I can stay  I gotta ask you  something  when you first  got on to do  the show  a lot of  skeptics  there were a lot  of skeptics  you have been  really tearing  it up  I'm sure you  knock wood  when that  happens  do you feel  like you've  shown people  like hey  I can do  this 
[02:24:30]  because  as a performer  everybody  probably thought  oh fuck  if I fuck  this up  I'm gonna  look like  an asshole  oh yeah  I mean  I knew  this was my last  thing  do you feel  vindicated  not really  I don't think  I ever will  I mean  it's still a fight  I think it's gonna  take you know  I'd say I've only been on  for two years  so I'd say  if five years  if I'm still on  then I go  okay then I can go  I did a decent job  but there had to have been  some kind of buzz  and support  right from the beginning  because they don't give  people that long  you know  you guys were on  when I first was on  I mean I think 
[02:25:00]  I've changed  even since then  yeah  for six months  or something  you guys came on  absolutely  we're calmed down  a bit more  you know  you don't know  the crew  you don't know  I don't know  how to host  a talk show  you know  probably when you  first came on  to do radio  you didn't know  how to do radio  it's like you  learn by doing it  dude you sang  with McCartney  how great is that  what a great gig that is  some of the  it got crazy  some of the shit  you're able to do  it's like  wow man  it got really crazy  I mean when  Springsteen wanted  to do a bit  and you go like 
[02:25:30]  this is just getting crazy  it's like  you can't  you have to put  horseplay  and you just gotta go  I can't  think about it  how do you hold it together  when you're singing  with McCartney  you're like  that's  I don't care who you are  that's fucking  Paul McCartney  I went down  he was on  Saturday Night Live  that week  and so I went down  to his dressing room  to get him to  just to say  they let you back in there  yeah they allowed me  back in  I still have my old key  my old ID pass  so I went in  and he goes  we're just gonna do a chat  we'll just do a quick chat  and that'll be great  your show's doing good 
[02:26:00]  I go cool  and I was like  clearly I don't think  he's ever seen the show  but I go  he's being nice  so I go  well I was wondering  if you want to do this bit  because I know  when you wrote yesterday  the original lyrics  were scrambled eggs  because back in the day  so he wouldn't forget it  in his sleep  he wrote  scrambled eggs  oh my lady  how I love your legs  and so that's  what he remembered  like  just a tune  so he goes  yeah that's true  I go  well me and this writer  this guy Mike Descent 
[02:26:30]  we wrote  the rest of the song  scrambled eggs  the original  and he's like  oh you know  I think I'm just gonna do a chat  you know  that's a quick talk  and that's all okay  but his show's great  it's really great  I go  okay  so I go  well can I just do it for you  I just wanna sing it for you quick  and if you wanna do it  you can  if not  sing it in front of McCartney  wow  if you wanna do it  you can  if you don't  then I'm gonna do it either way  I'll wear a wig  and I'll do it  he's like  well okay  so I go  scrambled eggs  oh my lady  how I love your legs  but not as much as I love  scrambled eggs  oh have you tried 
[02:27:00]  scrambled eggs  waffle fries  oh my baby  how I love your thighs  but not as much as I love  waffle fries  yeah  so then people in the room  start laughing  and next thing I know  his head's right over my shoulder  oh shit  he's like  they are so damn good  I lose  and he's singing  I was like  so then he gets his guitar  and I'm like  oh my gosh  so now it's like  so he's like  so I go  let me call up Ringo  so then he goes  yeah  I said alright  so what do you wanna do  he goes  oh no way  you're doing it with me

[02:53:00]  and what's his other hit  what about best friends girl  my that joke  by the cars  best friends girl  peace love and understanding  is going  that's a good song  elvis costello  give us some peace love  and understanding  best friends girl  is fucking  it tongues my fucking asshole  best friends girl  best friends girl  she used to be mine  but someone saying  best friends girl  was about a squirter  really  does that make the song  better  no not at all  all right  this is good  fair enough sir  fair enough  remember the video for this  he was making wacky faces  he used to make some  odd faces 
[02:53:30]  i wasn't  this is a good song  i would keep this song  on the radio  this is a good one  it came on but  i think he's a little  overrated  well he wasn't really  that highly rated  he's a nerd  nah he's up there  in rateability  yeah  that's what's weird  i never got  elvis costello  on that level  really  not really  all right  it leads us to  the new car song  i gotta hear  what's what's the  big single off this 
[02:54:00]  dumb thing  it's called  sad song  and rumor has it  ricko casick  is getting a divorce  and that's why  he said he dragged  his bandmates  back in the studio  i think Roland was  telling me that  i'm like really  that's now it all  makes sense  he had to fucking  go and make new  songs  really  why else would he  do it  what's his chick's  name  what was it  here is sad song  this is the new  song by  the cars  sounds like the  old stuff  it does  so far  oh my god  they really are 
[02:54:30]  just kind of  doing  rehashing  yeah  it's like  ozzy's new  song  nutty bus  nutty bus  it definitely 
[02:55:00]  sounds like  the car  voice sounds  but probably  the effects  you wouldn't  the voice sounds  exactly the same  you wouldn't be  confused  almost sounds  like a lost  track  but this sound  is kind of  coming back  in music  a little bit  so i don't  know  maybe it'll  work  what do i  know  you wouldn't  be confused  thinking this  was somebody  else  but what 
[02:55:30]  yeah why  would you  why would you  put out a  new album  with 12  brand new  songs  you could have  put this on  maybe another  new song  with a greatest  hits album  it would have  done fine  right  but maybe he's  done that already  i don't know  do you know  that song  whip it by  devo  oh yes i  boom boom  boom boom  i like to  make that noise  they love that  we don't need  to do this  anymore  sorry  this is a 
[02:56:00]  great fucking  and i don't  want to like  this song  but whip it  comes on  and i just  have to finger  my own ass  and again  this was one  of the 10  10 original  videos that  they used to  play on mtv  when it first  started  and you  just fucking  watch this  like a thousand  times  hey look  they're wacky  they got whips  and they got  wacky hats  and then they  went with i can't  get no satisfaction  yeah  their version  of i can't get  no satisfaction  that's that's  when they lost  me  a little weird  song too  and marta  quinn  yes 
[02:56:30]  marta quinn  she's still  doing it  on the 80s  channel  she's on the  80s channel  here they all  are aren't  they  except for  jj  nina black  what  yeah  you're not  gonna hit me  are you ramrod  what  what  i don't know  i can't just  his face  he's so odd  it's keen  with cahill  yeah  whatever  he's like  he lip syncs  everything  he lip syncs  is that the one 
[02:57:00]  that's uh  i interviewed him  in the  that's the king  i interviewed him  during the shit  hour  you guys went  home and all  sudden he showed  up i said fuck  this i'm interviewing  this little creep  i listened to that  because i wasn't in  that day  i videotaped him  and uh  first time  one of his videos  didn't do well  yeah  every other video  he does  does millions of  views  mine 20,000  and it was  sam's fault  right  for talking to him  on the radio  during the time  yeah but it was  the shit hour  we didn't have to  worry about  having the quality 
[02:57:30]  up so you just  play the song  again i say  if you want the  video without my  talking just  download this song  yeah but that's  a lot of work  it's not a lot of  it was right there  for everybody  it's literally  the top ten of  iTunes  it's a lot of  work sam  it's actually  kind of entertaining  he makes the  really wacky faces  and movements  yeah but for a kid  it's not bad  he's actually  he's probably  gonna be a very  funny guy  he'll get a gig  on some show  look for having  an incurable  liver disease  i think he does  very well  yeah there's some  kind of medical  difficulty there 
[02:58:00]  he looks like  a weird dwarf kid  he's fucking  he's 35 years old  i think he has  the gary coleman  i'm kidding  jimmy is looking  like a bunch  of bullshit  get your fucking  names and numbers  right  my mother would  always say  he was like 16  or something  that's what i hear  but when people  are questioning that  they wonder if  that's true  and he comes up  to your knee  about he's really  perfect  really that short  well maybe  that's a little  dollar  what three feet  maybe three and a  half feet  yeah he's really  short  i would bully him  you'd bully the 
[02:58:30]  little guy  what the fuck  you say man  and this is where  50 cent walks in  with him  yeah he's  50 just kind of  walks right in  how many views  does this have  this one has  32 million  and my video  with him has  22,000  what's he singing  thanks sam  this one has  50 cent in it  and yours has  sam talking on it  thank you  but alright  so somewhere in  the middle  would be nice  it's cause  you fucked it up  i didn't fuck it up  i didn't do the video  i did the radio show  yeah but then 
[02:59:00]  you made it hard for me  then i had to like  go find the song  i had the audio  right there  i had to bring  the audio to your  house it wasn't easy  i know  the whole thing  oh yeah  couldn't you just  like insert the  music later on  that's what i've been  saying  so sam would be  out of it  oh that's a good  idea  thanks for coming  up with that  oh yeah okay  it's not complicated  no problem  well why didn't you  tell me this earlier  it's so hard  it had to tell me  this  i've told you  it many times  fuck and i'm  gonna do that today  and give this video  another shot  it's not gonna work  it's not over yet  why  that song's still hot 
[02:59:30]  yeah but he probably  did it himself already  it's no 50 cent  it's a lie  wait for it  where's the  motherfucker  i don't see him  this is bullshit  it's just the boy  by himself  it's a small boy  he did the boy  yeah  there's the fitty  there's the fitty  fitty comes out  but is he really  in the room with him  oh  the kids probably  stand out  he's a gangster 
[03:00:00]  that fitty  and the kids  are gangster too  oh yeah  yeah i used to  rap with 50 in the  streets  you know what's  weird about this  video no one's  talking over it  yeah hey  yeah cause i guess  somebody who's more  skilled must have  made it cause it's  not a radio show  i don't make videos  i do radio shows  you do neither  now that anthony  gave me the good  idea  i'm gonna go home  and redo this  yeah i already gave  you that idea  you have a good  he has a good idea 
[03:00:30]  phone and a bad  idea phone  a good idea  phone and a bad  idea phone  i've been waiting  for the country  version i hope  that comes out  one day  oh it is  it's gotta be  twangy  yeah i think that  did pop out  already  did it  oh damn it  believe me  if you knew  the redundant  thoughts  do you know  i walked around  my apartment  thinking bill  tetley  for six hours  the other day  he's got a good  ball phone  and a naughty  ball phone  yeah  country

[03:03:00]  for this one  yeah  all of a sudden  the ted offensive breaks out  and gomer takes one  to the sun  excuse me  it's not the ted offensive  the ted offensive  we just  we just watched  all of oh my papa  from gomer pile  usmc  we're pathetic  this show's gotten really weird  today  hey we got brian johnson tomorrow  yeah  so there  I'm gonna tell him 
[03:03:30]  you guys are stupid  have you ever  have you ever had him yet  no  you're talking man  you're gonna have a ball with him  yeah  he's funny  yeah  you're gonna need a translator though  that's alright  you're gonna need a  I mean  I'm not  he's like  you see what I'm doing  in this thing  and it won't be happening to me  I'm just  whoa whoa whoa  he can't understand a fucking word  when I first started writing a book yesterday  and I got a skinny fucking joke there  it's gonna be a great time  that's what I'm saying 
[03:04:00]  saluting up  he really has never left  Newcastle  really  yeah  he's  he's part of England  which is like our Alabama  oh  okay  wow that makes perfect sense  you don't think of it that way  dude I did I ever tell you  when I went to  when I went to dinner with him  with my wife  oh no  dude this is the  this is the  funniest  and we gotta  okay  we go to dinner 
[03:04:30]  now my wife  alright  now my wife is  is  not born again  but like  at first she went born again  she scaled it back  she pulled it back  I remember  she pulled it back  you're saying that  but she's still there  okay  so  she's like  he calls up  he's like  we're gonna bring our lassies  to dinner  let's go to dinner  I'm gonna bring our lassies  so I bring it to my friend's place  down in Little Italy  so we go down there  and  he brings his wife  and Dee's there  and we start 
[03:05:00]  now Dee  at every meal  bows her head  and  you know  just silently  does it quick  so when she  right  so when she does that  I try to distract her  like  hey yeah  so who's the opening band  at the garden  who's playing that tomorrow  it's a big guy  did you see the  designing of it  it's a beautiful  Italian art  oh shit  but  now me and him  are drinking  we're just plowing  through red wine  and everything  out of his mouth  is fucking cunt 
[03:05:30]  everything  fucking cunt  cunt  fucking fucking cunt  and I keep looking over  at her  and she's laughing  she's laughing  her asses off  and he starts  going  you know  I got this great place  in fucking France  and we got a big yacht  and we wave  and we go along the crowd  and we wave  to all the fucks  and the cunts  and the cunts  and the cunts  and the fucking cunt  and then the year  I got to come to Florida  I got a big fucking pool  the fucking cunts  all over  and it's a great fucking time 
[03:06:00]  so it was about  550 cunts  10,000 fucks  and we finish dinner  and we're leaving  and D's face is laughing  she's like  he's one of the funniest guys  I've ever met  I told you  he's fucking hilarious  great  she's like  hey what a sweetheart  I said how cool though  he invited  he wants us and the kids  to go down there  she's like  we're never  ever  going  so he said  cunt  400 times  before you knew my name  we can't put our kids around 
[03:06:30]  we can't put our daughters  around that  I'm like  it's Brian though  she's like  Jim  he said cunt  500 times  and that's perfectly understandable  when he says it  it is  when he says it  it sounds like art  right  you'll see  he'll do it tomorrow  he's like  well you know  they're driving  a fucking cunt  and it's not  cunt is not as bad over there  no  it doesn't mean  no and it's not the way  he says it too  he says cunt  cunt  cunt  you'll see  it's fucking cunt 
[03:07:00]  oh don't  don't miss  Kevin's saying  we had him on before  I thought we had the other guy  no we had Angus Young  we had Angus  who's completely different  he was very odd  did you see  by the way  you're ACDC's fan right  yes  oh yeah  have you seen the new  freaking DVD  no  holy shit  you remember that ACDC video  that came out  the concert video  this is that  times 20  I'm not  why  I saw the ad for it 
[03:07:30]  it looks  insane  bro  the crowd is bouncing  bouncing  from the first song  to the very end  and the whole time  I'm looking for all the editing  I'm like  alright  they basically  they took one section  they just kept  they sing along  they sing along  to the guitar riffs  so when  that's going  da da da  100,000 people  da da da  da da da  and then they just  start  it looks like  liquid  it looks like liquid 
[03:08:00]  it does  it really does  like waves  and Brian Johnson's voice  I keep listening  for  he is clearly  singing  the way  he's  it's  it's crazy  it made me realize  no offense  to the Stones  but  this probably  is the greatest  rock band  that ever existed  shit  look at this  no wait  wait  wait  it's like a  Nuremberg rally  bro  watch when the song  kicks in 
[03:08:30]  this is the new  DVD by ACDC  watch when it kicks in  it's a sea of people  and it literally  like Anthony said  looks like liquid  they just start  bouncing  and it's  and they know  every single word  what's this  what's this  this  is the greatest  TV  I watched it  20 times already  wait  look at this  they mosh  painting  they were freaking  mosh painting  look at that  look at that 
[03:09:00]  it's an ocean  of people  look at that  this  it's  oh my god  that's  I got goosebumps  you gotta think  you're gonna die  in that crowd  oh it was  it was the greatest  this is by far  the greatest  rock  DVD concert  I've ever seen  in my life  live at River Plate  where are they  is it out now  is it  I don't know  is that what he's  promoting tomorrow  no he's promoting  a book tomorrow  which is very funny  they did in Buenos Aires  yeah what'd you get  I gotta get  you'd think they'd 
[03:09:30]  give me a book  to know what I'm  interviewing tomorrow  it's all about  his relationship  with cars  but it's not about cars  he talks about them  but very very funny  and then he tells a story  about like you know  how he fucking  tried to get laid in one  he has great stories  about all of them  it's a great book  he's a phenomenal  he should go on tour  just as a storyteller  I was wondering  if he wrote this  I'm like this is too funny  for a rock guy  but I guess he must have  oh I guarantee you  he wrote it  and he probably just  had a guy sitting there  transcribing  he should  oh forget it 
[03:10:00]  forget it  the thing's out of control  yeah  out of control  that's crazy  you're gonna have a ball  with him  yeah we're looking  forward to it  I just don't like  the language  that's funny  oh yeah  can we  yeah whatever  you want to say  yeah whatever you say  you know it's weird  going  going to every show  the anti-social network  and  everybody  comes up to me 
[03:10:30]  and goes  pizza guy  pizza guy  pizza guy  pizza guy  I've never seen  anything like it  I actually  we requested  for  on behalf of  I had a great  conversation with  Jimmy  because he  I don't want to  give him any more  fuel  but  he's  he's a little  he's a little off  he's a little off  and  I actually 
[03:11:00]  asked  the listeners  if they can  take down  the YouTube  piece  just to cool  his  because he's  we had a run-in  we had a couple  run-ins  and I don't  like  the  the tone  of the run-ins  really  I'm not worried  for me  I don't like  how  my family  was approached  when I wasn't  around  oh  and I  you know  I don't want to  give him too much  credit  but 
[03:11:30]  both sides  have made their  point  both sides  have made their  point  you've made  your point  you've made  his point  it is what  it is  it's like  Jim said  what he had  to say  the other guy  said what he  had to say  you move on  right  that's all  and right  and it's  it's over  and like to  move along  I'd like to  move along  when it's over  you made your  point  it's almost  like you don't  have to torture  a guy with it  you made your  point  and then you  just  you go forward  and that's  the end of it  he goes forward  with his thing  you go forward  with your thing  right  and 
[03:12:00]  I thought  we were all  moving along  but there was  a bizarre  little incident  it didn't  it didn't  it alarmed  me a little  and so  and then  when I had  a run  I seen  that a lot  of his  fuel  is from  the YouTube  piece  so  I'm like  you know what  he don't need  that in his  life  just like  Jimmy said  we came  to a fight  I came  to  swing  hard 
[03:12:30]  swing  hard  and  that's it  I'll take  my robe  off  and I'll  let it be  I'll reflect  back in the day  remember that  fight you had  yeah  that was a good  time  good fight  good fight  so  if  any of your  listeners are  kind enough  it would help  me out  tremendously  if you're just  like you know  what  just  we'll take  it down  for you  yeah  hopefully  it'll listen  that's a request 
[03:13:00]  it's the right  simple  it's the right  thing man  and it's  it's more  of a  family thing  man  it's really  yeah  you wanna  you know  if you were  just alone  fuck it  correct  if it was just  me  I really  I would be  worse  probably be  in prison  or someone  else would be  yeah  yeah true  for  yeah  but everyone  thinks about  the family  Jim thinks  about his  family  I'm sure  that guy  thinks about  the way  his family  it's like  everyone's got  their family  at stake  so it's like  you don't want  your family  hearing bad  stuff about 
[03:13:30]  you  Jim doesn't  want  his family  you know  what I mean  it's like  move on  it's done  right  he had little  kids  he still has  little kids  great little  kids  and we'll get  into a better  side of it  as time  goes on  sure  if time  oh man  boy I'd like  to unleash  but  all I'm going  to say  is it would  help the  cause  if that  was just  taken out  fair enough  that's not  a bad request  at all  no  I've requested  certain things  to be taken  down  usually they're 
[03:14:00]  cool about it  I've been a  trooper over  the years  it's time to  call in a  favor  that's all  call in a  favor  after the  years of  fucking  tainment  he'll perform  at your pool  party this  summer  off the air  I'll tell you  some great  stories  how's antisocial  going Jim  oh my god  you guys  having a blast  tell him  the last  show  his feathers  were pretty  darn
