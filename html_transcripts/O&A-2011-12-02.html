<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a prolonged, repetitive announcement of the show's title before diving into a critique of a CNN anchor's hair, comparing it to various unflattering objects.  The conversation then shifted to producer Danny's impressive weight loss and smoking cessation.  A discussion about facial moles and their attractiveness followed, referencing celebrities like Cindy Crawford and Angelina Jolie, leading into a commentary on a viral video of a virgin couple's awkward first kiss at their wedding.  Callers contributed anecdotes, including one about a man with unusual celibacy issues, prompting the hosts to declare the idea of saving oneself for marriage "weird."  The segment ended with a brief discussion of fast food preferences.

The show continued with a discussion of the "Bertation Lady" video and further speculation about the virgin kiss video, including potential extended versions and spoofs.  This transitioned into a discussion of the hosts' past experiences with virgins and non-virgins, recounted with graphic detail and crude language.  The hosts’ descriptions covered aspects such as discovering birth control pills and the evolution of female pubic hair grooming trends.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a tribute to the recently deceased comedian Patrice O'Neal, focusing on his posthumous CD, "Mr. P," and the 16-hour radio tribute showcasing his best work. The hosts discussed O'Neal's unique comedic style, his legal troubles, and the unexpected surge in his popularity after his death. The tribute also included discussions of Gallagher's stand-up, O'Neal's "Black Phillip" show, and the funeral industry, specifically alleged scams involving the reuse of flowers and coffins. Callers shared experiences within the floral and funeral industries.

Opie made offensive jokes, including a racist riff on Gallagher, before a pre-recorded "Primetime Sam Roberts" segment featuring a brief interview with Steven Tyler was aired. This was followed by Anthony Cumia's offensive "Psychotic City Driving" guide. A young child called in expressing his fondness for "boobies" and "hineys," prompting further crude commentary. The hosts then made ageist and appearance-based comments about Britney Spears' 30th birthday.  A substantial portion of the show focused on Angel Adams, a woman with fifteen children and a history of welfare dependency and conflicts with social services, discussed with highly offensive and racist language by the hosts and callers. A tribute to "Blind Dave," a deceased former show associate, was also included.  Jordan, a regular contributor, called in complaining about being put on hold. The segment concluded with further offensive jokes and the announcement that Vic Henley cancelled his appearance due to illness.

A segment focused on the promotion of Patrice O'Neal's "Mr. P" CD, highlighting its immediate success on iTunes. This segment included a heated, comedic rivalry between in-studio guests Jordan and Bobo, escalating into a verbal battle with increasingly outrageous insults.  Topics included Jordan's supposed sexual exploits, Bobo's health problems, their comedic abilities, and Bobo’s job. The argument veered into bizarre tangents, including getting hit by a Cadillac, Bobo’s phone calls, and complaints about the MTA.  The segment concluded with the "F.U. Line" and a discussion of the presidential primaries, focusing on perceived candidate ineptitude, alongside discussions about pizza and video games.

A discussion about pizza, particularly "Little Vincent's," led to reminiscences about late-night fast food escapades and throwing leftover food at Jack-in-the-Box. The hosts debated the best pizza in various New York areas, including a detailed and graphic discussion of Buffalo's "Fish Fry Friday" tradition, including descriptions of the fish and tartar sauce and graphic descriptions of semen consistency. This transitioned into a somber discussion about Patrice O'Neal's death, with a call from Kevin Hart sharing his grief and memories of O'Neal.  The show then returned to its usual irreverent style with discussions about bodily fluids, a listener's unconventional use of the English language on Twitter, and a humorous Siri anecdote. A caller offered a possible explanation for the Fish Fry Friday tradition's link to Lent, and another shared a story of listening to the show in college.

A call from Bobo at the DMV led to a lengthy and increasingly absurd phone call filled with offensive and racist remarks directed at DMV employees and those around him, encouraged by the hosts. This segment included numerous racial slurs and offensive stereotypes, interspersed with live reads for various sponsors. The segment concluded with a final tribute to Patrice O'Neal.

The after-show included numerous advertisements and a "dueling idiots" segment featuring Bobo and Jordan, with Jordan on hold for the entire duration. The hosts and interns discussed their reactions, leading to Matt's dismissal from the studio. Steve Sterniolo from Raw Dog, a guest, discussed his work and an upcoming 12-day call-in show with a large cash prize.  The segment included further advertisements and discussions about the call-in show's format, value, and financial implications, mentioning upcoming guests, including Joe DeRosa.

[00:04:00]  O.P. and Anthony show.  He's the day over here.  They don't listen to the day over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  In this day and age, you can take the berries off your face.  Jesus. 
[00:04:30]  God, I hate that.  I'm sure we're talking to a few people that have berries on their faces.  Take them off your face every day.  I had some, like, invisible berries on my face.  They're called moles for most people.  I call them berries.  I had that shit sliced off.  Cut it off.  You could get that shit sliced off, and it's relatively inexpensive.  Yeah.  You don't have to live in a world where you have a berry on your face.  We're saying this because CNN, there's an anchor on CNN when we're doing this horse shit. 
[00:05:00]  And she is just infuriating because her hair is so goddamn awful.  I don't know her name.  It's some Asian woman.  She's an ugly Asian woman, which is almost impossible, too, by the way.  Yep.  You know, we all know that when the Asians age.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But when they're younger, for the most part, they're pretty fucking good looking.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And she's probably, we're looking at a woman that's no more than 40, so it's not like she's, 
[00:05:30]  she should be ugly.  Can't tell if she's 25 or 40.  I know.  You're kind of right about that.  So odd.  When I just said 40, I'm like, give or take 10 years.  But then she has this fucked up hair.  It's Worf from Star Trek.  Yeah.  She's got Worf hair, Klingon hair.  It comes from the top of her head and then wraps around her head in this odd, I can't even  describe it.  It's like, what the fuck was that thing growing up? 
[00:06:00]  It was those light beams, those, help me out, fuck.  Like a troll doll.  Like a troll doll, sure.  There's troll doll hair.  But remember the other thing where lights went through it?  Individual, like, optics.  Oh, fiber optic.  Oh, Danny's running emails.  Danny's chugging down the hallway.  You know what I'm talking about, right?  What is, what I think you're talking about is like those fiber optics.  Yes.  But they popped up and then kind of fell to the sides. 
[00:06:30]  It was like shitty things that you would put on like an end table in your living room.  Right, right.  And tacky, some awful tacky.  And individual light would go through the optics.  Yeah.  She has hair like that.  By the way, you just sprinted down the hall.  That was very impressive.  I haven't seen anyone run around here in years.  I hate when, like, I hear something and I'm like, oh, I could add to that, but I need  to obviously get there immediately.  Right.  So I run down the hallway and then I'm like, yeah, what I want to tell you about.  You're in shape now, though, Danny. 
[00:07:00]  It's not the old Danny.  You can handle a run down the hall now.  Well, I used to be, and then I stopped doing all those things that made me in shape.  So I'm just, I weigh less.  I'm not in shape.  You're maintaining.  How long has it been since you smoked?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Five years.  Jesus.  About?  Almost?  Almost five years.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Danny's kind of changed his whole fucking life, man.  Good thing you cut off those cigarettes.  Yeah, man.  I never expected to quit either.  Less booze, no smokes, and he told me 30 pounds, he's down. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  Well, you know what?  It's not so much that it's fucked up I lost all that weight, it's fucked up to think that  I actually weighed that much.  That's what's fucked up.  This is just normal.  How much did you weigh when you first joined us?  I was about like a buck 55, I guess.  So you're right around your starting weight?  Just about.  I'm maybe a few pounds heavier now, like maybe 158.  Damn.  That's not bad.  I hope B-Rock's listening.  That's not bad.  It's possible.  High school weight when you're 30, right?  Yeah.  But this woman on CNN, and then she has a burry on her face, it's like, just fucking 
[00:08:00]  shave that shit off, man.  It's not even sexy on Cindy Crawford anymore.  Oh, God, no.  I just don't wait.  When I see women like that, and they have that one fucking dark mole, all I think is  that's a spot of duty on her face.  Duty.  I can't get past that.  And especially when it's in an area that you'd be kissing.  Yes.  You know?  It's like Cindy Crawford's got that.  It's like, ew.  I never thought it was a sexy mole on her, by the way.  Oh.  No.  The rest of her was so over-the-top fucking hot. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That it didn't matter, I guess.  But I never thought the mole itself was sexy.  You know there's going to be like a big, thick dog hair poking out of it.  Yeah.  Even if you shave it down, you know there's going to be that one.  It's going to be a stubble all the time.  Like that thing on Brundle's back.  Look at that.  See, we're looking at an old picture of Cindy Crawford, and if she would have just got rid  of that mole.  Now it's probably too late.  You think?  Because it's bigger now.  It would be a chore. 
[00:09:00]  Well, they like to dig in.  Moles like to dig in.  Dig in.  They go deeper.  Hunker down.  Oh, yeah.  I had a few removed where I had to have a stitch.  Because they had to dig it out.  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm all about mole removal.  I don't do much to help my appearance, but the one thing was moles.  Time to get rid of these fucking things.  Yeah, I don't like the ones by the lips and stuff.  You gotta, you gotta.  No, man.  Yeah.  This guy I grew up with, he had a mole that was like right on his lip, like where his 
[00:09:30]  mustache would be.  Really?  Yeah, so, you know, he didn't get 12 years of being called shit lip.  And he did have it removed.  But you know what the funny part was?  I guess it's preference, because, you know.  He had it removed so late in life.  It was like, what was the point?  Like, you already went through all the torment.  Right, yeah.  The school years and everything where it really.  That's where it really hurt.  Yeah.  Maybe back then it was harder to get rid of him.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  But, I mean, they run specials and everything.  They'll take 20 moles off your body for the price of 200 bucks or something. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, what's his name?  Iglesias there?  No, yeah.  Iglesias.  He got his removes.  Yeah, he had a giant thing.  He knows what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Get that berry off your face.  He had that Aaron Neville thing going on, where it's just giant.  Anyone have berries on their faces around here, Sam, that I now have to awkwardly walk past?  You've alienated?  I don't think so.  Let's point out berries on faces today.  From now on, we should.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm trying to think of anybody around here as berries. 
[00:10:30]  Maybe we're all blessed.  I'm not saying we're blessed.  This is my preference.  Face berries are a standalone fruit.  Yeah.  Coming up.  Just kidding.  20 after the hour.  Let's see.  I'm going to leave that one alone.  Good for you.  Yeah.  I'm going to leave that one alone.  Bigger man.  Yeah.  I'm going to try to leave that one alone.  Alone.  No, it's just preference.  I mean, I'm sure there's guys out there that enjoy a woman that has a berry on the face 
[00:11:00]  and probably spends a lot of time just focusing on it and licking it and kissing it.  I don't know about that.  And getting that one hair between their teeth as they're kissing it.  Yeah.  I bet there's nobody that has that preference.  Uh-huh.  I don't think there's anybody that's actually attracted to moles.  I bet there are people that don't mind berries.  Then why aren't the women getting them off their face?  I don't know.  They should.  I don't think anyone is attracted to the berries on the face.  I don't think anybody is.  I'll tell you guys.  There's something called Rule 34. 
[00:11:30]  Uh-huh.  And what Rule 34 dictates is that on the internet, anything that can be sexual is sexual.  So I bet you if you dig deep and you look hard enough, you will find some kind of face  berry fetish website where there's nothing but pictures of chicks with berries on their  face getting cum all over them.  I bet you there's somebody that jerks off to face berries.  Yes.  You're right.  Yeah.  Somebody out there.  All right.  People are twisted.  I know we're a little late to the party, but you saw the virgin kiss, right, by now?  The what?  The virgin's kissing when they got married, the TLC clip. 
[00:12:00]  I have not seen this.  You found the website?  It's Fetish Friday.  It's not like a porn website.  Hot women with moles.  Hot women with moles.  Yeah.  Cindy Crawford.  That's obviously Cindy Crawford.  Cindy Crawford.  And that's Sam looking.  So if I was looking, I'd find her to me.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Sam.  Where's the mole on this broad?  Right there.  Where?  Oh, next to our schnozzola.  But these are women that would be hot without the...  It's not the mole that makes these women good looking. 
[00:12:30]  No.  The problem is when the mole is dark and around the mouth, like Anne said.  Yeah.  I always, like I said, it looks like a speck of duty, and it bothers me.  Oh, she's just got one on her cheek there.  That doesn't count.  Nah, the cheek is fine.  Natalie Portman.  It's more around, like, the mouth and up near the eyes.  Oh, Angelina.  That chick's got one.  Huh?  Angelina.  Oh, that's Angelina Jolie.  Jolie.  She's got one above her eyebrow.  God damn, look at those lips. 
[00:13:00]  God, her lips look weird.  You don't like those lips?  Nah, they're like fucking...  It's like fucking meat.  But those are natural lips.  It's like raw meat.  That's not that shit that the Hollywood women are doing.  No, it's not.  But she looks like she's got perpetual chapped lips, and they're just too scraggly, ragged.  They're all, like, lumpy.  Yeah.  Who else got the moles?  Who's that?  Aaron Watson.  There's the Cindy Crawford.  Oh, no, that's...  Ava Mendez.  Ava Mendez has the Cindy Crawford, but a little higher up and further out on the cheek. 
[00:13:30]  It's more on the cheek.  The season's changed on her face.  Now that I'm looking at some of these moles, I think it's bothersome around the mouth.  Around the mouth.  Because you think, all right, that's a piece of food or something.  Yeah.  Right?  Rachel McAdams.  In the chin area.  Oh, she's got it underneath on the chin area.  It might be just more around the mouth.  That really bothers me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Mandy Moore, it's a little next to her nose, but it's...  She got hotter the older she got. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Mandy Moore is fucking...  That picture of her right there is stunning.  Scar Joe has one on her cheek.  Where's Scar Joe's?  Scar Joe.  Oh.  Where's hers?  On her cheek.  Yeah.  It's so little, though.  It's like nothing.  Nah.  That's not a problem at all.  Yeah, most of the ones we just looked at here on the show, I don't mind at all.  Yeah, yeah.  The Crawford one always bothered me.  Yeah, that one is just...  It always just bothered me, man.  It's too much to deal with.  It always just bothered me, man.  And you know, it's... 
[00:14:30]  Like you said, it's bigger and deeper.  Because it's not just a mark that's, like, even with the rest of the skin around it.  Yeah.  It's volcanic.  You can see the depth.  Yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  It definitely has an elevation to it.  There's a shadow.  Yeah.  You guys didn't see the...  The sundial.  You guys really didn't see the virgins kissing yet?  No.  I haven't.  It's a new show on TLC, and the preview clip did close to 2 million views in, like, 48 hours.  Really?  Just for a dumb preview clip.  I guess it's a show about virgins? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, it's called The Virgin Diaries.  Virgin Diaries.  Virgin Diaries.  Thank you, Travis.  You haven't seen this yet?  Nay.  Holy fuck.  Okay.  Virgin couple shares first kiss.  I just assume most people have seen it by now, because, you know, we've been preoccupied with just  fucking morbid stuff the last three days.  If you get married and you're virgins, you're fucking stupid.  But is this also their first kiss on their wedding day?  They haven't even kissed?  Wow.  What do they do?  Let me explain.  That's crazy.  I believe, if I know the story correctly, they're both virgins.  The woman has kissed before. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, shit.  The guy has never kissed before.  Are you sure the woman has kissed?  Did you watch this clip?  I've seen the clip.  It's all second guess you're Travis.  But you've seen the guy?  Guy way worse.  No, girl way worse.  Really?  Travis has kissed that guy.  Well, I'll be the judge.  Play the clip.  Travis would always find the girl to be way worse.  Yeah, true.  This is how I understand it, though.  They've been, you know, dating and they're going to get married.  And besides not having sex, they didn't want to kiss each other until their wedding  day.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  And supposedly, I read that she has kissed guys before.  He's never kissed anything before.  Kissed them on the dick.  You haven't seen this yet?  No.  This is fucking great.  Let me see.  Got sound?  Sunday.  I'm 30.  I'm a virgin.  I'm 29 and I'm a virgin.  Ew.  I'm not a virgin entirely by choice.  Oh, boy.  Ugh.  We're saving our first kiss for our wedding.  I now declare you to be husband and wife. 
[00:16:30]  Ryan, you may kiss your bride.  Oh, boy.  Really?  Yes.  He's eating her face.  We did diaries in all these kids.  Oh, it's a kiss.  Oh, it's a kissy.  All right, that's hilarious.  I can't believe you guys haven't seen that yet.  I haven't seen that.  You see her.  You know what?  And I got it.  I now agree with Travis because the second clip they show of them kissing, yeah, the woman  is way worse.  She's trying to eat his face. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It looks like they're both trying to eat each other's face.  Right.  There is a horniness there.  Oh, God.  There's a level of horniness there that you can't describe.  Do you know the rod he must have had?  Do you think he was erect at the altar in front of everyone?  Oh, fuck yes.  If he's never kissed a woman before and they went in for that kiss, you got to think he  made cumsies at the altar.  Rod, yes.  Fuck the rod part.  I think he went all in.  That's like, because he looks like he's convulsing.  He's probably coming.  Do you prep for that?  Like, do you think, all right, I'm going to kiss my bride.  I'm going to have a rod. 
[00:17:30]  I better flip up my dick into my cummerbund so when it gets hard, it keeps everything  in there.  He doesn't know.  He doesn't know shit.  He's just got a crusty stain on his pants for the entire reception.  Yeah, because he probably doesn't even know.  Like, what is happening?  What is this?  He's had boners before.  That's true.  But he might not have ever came in his pants.  No, I think he made cumsies.  Yeah.  You want to see it again?  Yeah, let me see that kiss.  It's fantastic.  It's too bad we don't have a visual element for the show.  And the family's watching and laughing.  Play this for everybody.  They're all laughing.  We can post it on the Facebook page and then everybody can go there and watch it. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  We'll have this clip up in a few minutes.  Attack, attack.  And then they go to the audience.  And everyone's laughing.  Only on TLC.  She is fucked and fucking horny.  Do you know what?  She's going to be a fucking animal in bed and he's not going to know what to do.  He's going to come in two seconds.  But she gives a mean blowjob, though.  Oh, yeah.  Well, how she's fucking eating his face.  Biting and chewing.  Yeah, if she was treating his dick like she's treating his tongue right there, that's good shit. 
[00:18:30]  She's just...  She wants that dick so bad.  Oh, she needs the cock.  It's been so long.  Yes.  But it's Virgin Diaries.  And yeah, this clip is everywhere, man.  Yeah, you can't get married like that.  Be a virgin and get married.  You're an idiot.  While I was watching this preview thing with everybody talking about their experiences before the kiss, all I could think about was inserting Bobo audio about his V-problem. 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  He called it into this trailer.  By the way, I left.  Chris, I was just going to go to the Poconos.  There was a guy that said, I'm not a virgin by choice.  Right.  That's what made me think of Bobo.  And we all just blew it off.  But was he molested?  No, I think he just...  So he technically thinks he's still a virgin because he didn't do it his way?  Yeah, yeah.  I think he just can't find a nice honey to bang.  But why is he a...  Oh, I see.  Like he's not saving himself.  He just...  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Can't get that dick wet, no matter how hard he tries. 
[00:19:30]  Can't do it.  That dick.  Nope.  His dick.  Look at that curling problem.  That...  They're weirdos.  Like virgins...  People that save themselves for marriage are weirdos.  Very strange.  They're just strange people.  Sorry.  Because you're missing a human experience.  I would so agree.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something that there's a social...  Developmentally.  ...socially awkward problem that they had.  Right.  That turned into a I'm saving myself for marriage.  Right.  Look at this dick.  You've got to hear how Sam thinks that's weird, but he won't have a cheeseburger. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, I know.  I know.  It's...  Well, you have your cheeseburger.  That's a human experience that you're missing.  And I'll get my chicks.  Yeah.  But I'll have some hair pie.  Oh, shit.  I had a cheeseburger yesterday.  Do you know how good they are?  Yeah.  Yeah.  With ketchup and pickles and tomatoes.  Yeah.  And I go with the steak fries.  I'm a steak fry guy.  Oh, that's...  I like girly fries.  You like the girly fries?  I like girly fries.  Girly fries.  Shoestring fries can be good.  Shoestrings are great.  I always like the big fucking steak fries. 
[00:20:30]  I like those.  Whose mom can make the best fries?  Ooh.  My mom makes pretty sweet fries.  French fry champion?  My mom can make better fries than your mom.  You know what's bad about steak fries, though?  If you eat them too fast, they just reside in your fucking throat.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And you're like, I think nothing's getting to my stomach.  Oh, yeah.  I have to drink something.  But you become a duty factory the next day.  Just a duty factory.  This big lump of starch coming out your asshole.  If you get too excited when you get a steak fry and you take a bite, as soon as it gets...  You burn your roof of your mouth bad. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That hot potato inside.  It's like, yeah, the inside is scalding.  How about you fucking relax a little bit?  It's exciting.  How is a steak fry exciting?  You really...  Sometimes you can't keep but eating something when it's really hot.  Exactly.  I want to enjoy this.  Ow.  Like hot soup.  That's another thing.  It hurts.  You know, we're playing videos.  Did you guys see the Bertation Lady?  It's more of a visual.  Another Bertation?  The Bertation Lady is in another viral video.  What?  The one that, like, had the initial Bertation? 
[00:21:30]  She's waiting to talk.  I think it's about the Santa Ana winds or something.  Yes.  And there's a homeless guy, or maybe she was at Occupy LA, I can't really tell, and there's  a homeless guy just fucking attacking her, and she's trying to ignore him.  I think it's not an officially... I don't think it was on TV.  That's just her doing a heavy first station.  She's waiting to talk.  And this homeless guy's like, you ought to be shopping.  Go shop.  Serene Branson. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  It's just starting to hit the internet.  It'll probably be pretty hot later today.  Somebody tweeted it to me yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  I think this might be more of a visual.  That's her.  It started over.  So the famous Bertation Lady.  It's called, Can You Do This on YouTube?  Oh, my God.  I got to go shop.  OMG.  OMG.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:30]  Are you shopping now?  And he won't leave either.  No.  And she's trying to ignore him.  What a fucking lunatic.  That's making the rounds.  People think if you just ignore something, it'll go away, and it never does. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, it doesn't.  Never.  They just figure, wow, I could do this forever, because no one's telling me to stop.  And they could see it in your eyes that it's bothering you.  That it's really annoying you.  Yeah.  No matter if you're saying anything or not.  Marion from OBX.  Love the OBX.  She says, check out the extended kiss scene for Virgin Diaries.  I only saw that clip.  Is there a better clip out there?  There's an extended?  Wow.  When you want to help out the show, you've got to give us a link or something, because  I don't even know where that clip is.  Virgin Diaries.  We'll try to find it.  Got a lot of spoofs.  Am I seeing? 
[00:23:30]  No, I'm not seeing anything over 30 seconds.  Really?  Oh, people have spoofed it already, yeah.  The extended kiss scene.  Oh.  I don't know if it's...  Saving our first kiss for our wedding.  I now declare you to be husband and wife.  Ryan, you may kiss your brother.  Really?  Yeah.  That's why I dislikes this video.  Oh, yeah.  It's fake.  Oh, it's...  One of those.  I hate fakeness.  I hate intranet's fakeness.  One of those.  Yeah, they just kept looping it, and they're putting horrible sounds to it. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  Oh, God.  It's not that bad.  If that's the one Marion's talking about, whatever.  She's falling down, it looks like, when she's kissing him.  I know.  She's leaning...  Leading forward.  She's just dripping everywhere.  Yeah, she really is just a drippy mess at that point.  Dance floor is going to be a wreck.  Skating.  Virgin's always sucked.  Skating on her own vaginal fluids as it runs down her leg.  You've knocked back a few virgins, right?  Oh, yeah.  They always sucked. 
[00:24:30]  Used to be my forte.  To take out a virgin?  To see flowerings.  Really?  Yeah, I loved it.  Was that on your business card?  I actually hated being with chicks that had been fucked.  Jesus.  It was terrible.  It was a lot of cultivating.  It's a lot of work.  Yeah.  You've got to put in your fucking...  You've got to put in your weeks.  Your time.  It's like weeks it takes before you can actually do it.  You can't just hook up and fuck a virgin. 
[00:25:00]  It's very difficult.  You've got to put in your time.  You've got to build, like, kind of a relationship.  And then before you know it, you're fucking...  Then you're like, peace out.  Well, no.  I would never do that either.  It would usually...  It was some type of, like, relationship kind of a thing after a while.  But, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you realize she's not a virgin anymore.  Well, it's okay because it was me.  You just don't want to touch where that other dick's been.  Yeah.  For a while it was like that.  For a while it was like that. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  You still got that dick juice down there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember the first...  Like, and then I started going out with a girl that I wasn't sure if she'd been fucked  before or anything.  It was the first...  I think it was, like, one of the first couple of girls that I've been with that hadn't been  a virgin or something.  Yeah.  I think it was the first one.  Aside from Buzz, who was my first fuck out in California.  She wasn't a virgin?  No, she was not.  She fucked everyone.  She was a virgin that day.  That... 
[00:26:00]  Maybe.  Well, that afternoon.  Maybe that afternoon she was a virgin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But there was this one girl, and then I was like, oh, you know, I kind of like this girl,  and, you know, I hope I get the chance to have some sexual intercourse.  Yeah.  And then I was in her bedroom, and she, you know, we were making out, and she had to get  up and go to the bathroom or some shit.  And I looked on her night table, and I saw birth control pills.  Really?  And I was, like, all fucked up.  I'm like, shit.  What? 
[00:26:30]  Does that mean she's been fucking?  How dare she?  She wasn't innocent.  No.  She wasn't angelic.  She was not.  She was a whore.  That's right.  She's a whore.  What, Norman?  Norman?  Did you get it in?  Eventually.  Good for you.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Good for you.  I fucked up.  Yeah, motherfucker.  God, I hope my in-laws aren't listening today.  Can you turn off the radio?  Tell them to turn it off.  Turn it off!  Do you remember, um, do you remember dirty pussy? 
[00:27:00]  Uh, well, it all depends on what you mean by that.  I think I know.  We're all old enough to remember dirty pussy.  The women just make sure that area is taken care of now.  Yeah.  I'm not talking about, like, bad, you know, smells that aren't going to go away because  they got something going on.  Uh-huh.  Just dirty in general.  What do you mean?  Just that dirty pussy smell.  Like, oh, oh.  I think it was because they weren't shaving it all off.  Well, they weren't shaving it off at all. 
[00:27:30]  So, that made kind of a, something happening down there to begin with.  I kind of, uh, I kind of dug seeing that, though.  It was, there was something about just seeing, like, the first time a girl, like, took her  pants off and you just pulled down her panties and you just saw that triangle.  That meant something when I was growing up.  It meant something.  You saw it and it was like, there's no dick there.  Well, I see me in the mirror and I see a dick and now I'm seeing no dick. 
[00:28:00]  The best was, great.  The best was when you were trying to get to some bases.  P-dirt.  Yeah.  That's funny.  The best was when you were trying to knock, knock back some bases and, uh, you know, you  go in the pants and when you felt that patch, you're like, okay, I'm getting something  done here.  It was like, uh, it was like quicksand in the forest.  You'd be feeling around.  It's like rustle, rustle, rustle, rustling like leaves.  And, and then, and then you'd feel like that heavy moisture in the middle of it.  It's like, oh, oh, I found it. 
[00:28:30]  I found it.  Yeah.  Most people these days, they'll, they'll never know the, uh, uh, the experience of ripping  open, uh, some female pubic hair.  Like it's an SOS pad before you can get to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like, it was like fucking, it was that last security that they had, like a Venus  fly trap that was just kind of shut.  Yeah.  And you see it and like, it really would end up kind of tangled up sort of like Velcro  in front of there.  And you had to unhook it and get in there. 
[00:29:00]  You really had to push it aside to get to the pussy.  But that, that's what made some of that dirty pussy.  It was like kind of, uh, kind of musky.  It was good.  It kind of, is it musky or musty?  Musty or musk.  Well, there's a musk kind of a.  Kind of a musky.  Edwin musky.  Wasn't he a politician or something?  Kind of like, uh, you know, the feeling that it might need some fresh air.  It's got to breathe a little.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just had a, it had a stuffy kind of, like an old closed up house that needs the windows 
[00:29:30]  open.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  You've got to throw those windows open every so often.  Air that fucker out.  Yeah.  Like an old linen closet.  Probably shouldn't be a flavor saver down there.  No, but, but let me tell you, you dig right the fuck in.  There was no, there was no like, oh, I wish she'd do this or that or anything.  Well, we didn't know that.  You put your face right in that.  No, there was a time that wasn't even an option.  You weren't, you were, you were never thinking, oh, I wish she, uh, wish she shaved everything  off. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  First time you saw that, it was fucking weird.  If you think about it.  Yeah.  Oh, the first shaved.  Yes.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now it's now.  Yeah.  Right on.  I'm all in, but the first time you saw that, you're like, what the fuck?  Are you a freak?  I don't think I can even remember the first time I saw a shaved one.  Oh yeah.  Was it slutty girls that started doing it or did people just start doing that?  I think strippers were like the first ones that did it.  Most likely it was strippers.  And it wasn't, I don't think I went from full hairy pussy seeing that to full shaved. 
[00:30:30]  I think I saw like some shaved down versions.  Well, you got to see the evolution.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The vagina.  Because I think that would have been freakish to just all of a sudden see, ah, there's nothing  there.  It was your pussy on the chemo.  It was kind of like the rainforest.  It was slowly going away.  Yeah.  Slowly losing it.  I mean, if you, you know, year to year, you're like, ah, the rainforest is fine.  It's still there.  It's good.  It was kind of just slowly going away.  But then if you go from, you know, a picture 10 years ago to now. 
[00:31:00]  You realize.  Now you're like, holy fuck.  There's nothing down there anymore.  Some defoliant.  Some agent orange.  Yeah.  But the first time you saw it, you're like, you are a freak.  You're a whore.  But guys must have looked odd, though, back in the day, eating some snatch.  And when she looked down at you, and you just got this big fucking Groucho Marx mustache.  It must have just looked like you had a giant mustache and beard and shit.  I was like, you know, they had hair.  Fucking most guys were growing mustaches. 
[00:31:30]  And there was just hair everywhere.  Yeah, it was just a big hairy design.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Who was that movie reviewer?  That's who you looked like.  Gene Shalott.  Gene Shalott.  Every guy eating snatch looked like Gene Shalott back then.  That's really funny.  Oh, fuck, man.  Gene Shalott.  But, again, you just didn't fucking care.  It was so cool to see.  Just that fucking, look at that.  Two legs, some hair, and no dick. 
[00:32:00]  Carolina Man's going racing stripe.  The problem with the racing stripe was, you know, then they laid down and it's like, wait,  the racing stripe is way too far away from the action.  Yeah, yeah.  But if they're standing, it's okay.  I don't understand.  When they'd shave the pussy like that and shave away the hair, all the hair from the pussy area  and just leave the triangle at the top, you'd look and realize when they laid down, it looked silly.  It looked way too far away.  It's like the hair is like an island, hoasis, away from the snatch and shit. 
[00:32:30]  Very delicate maneuver, shaving that thing, girls.  Yeah.  Nobody wants to ship to it.  No.  It's just too far.  Oh, Tony from Brooklyn.  I think this is one of Anthony's classic lines.  Go ahead, Tony.  I wish I would have said this, but I never laughed so hard.  A guy called in.  You guys were talking about redheads and hairy pussies.  And the guy said, yeah, it looks like an Irish setter with a wet mouth.  Yeah.  All right, brother. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  That's still right in the back of our heads.  Don't you fucking be confused, man.  I'm fucking walking around like a goddamn zombie.  Yarr.  And I guess Monday is the memorial, huh?  Yep.  It's going to be a long weekend.  Oh, I know.  Which is okay.  But it's just like, fuck.  And we've all been through it.  I just can't wait until it's over with.  Tell you the truth.  Yeah.  I'll be honest with you.  I don't like this stuff.  No, I wish I could time travel.  I don't think anyone does. 
[00:33:30]  I wish I could time travel to Tuesday because then it is what it is.  You know what I mean?  You'd be bummed if somebody said you could time travel until Friday.  You just wish you could time travel until Tuesday.  Yeah.  It's like, no, I'm not going to time travel until Friday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It would be nice to just get it over with.  That shit is right in front of us still, man, and will be for a really long time.  But we're going to run an amazing special this weekend on the channel.  I think it's 16 hours of material, Iraq told me.  16 hours.  It's going to play like three different times or something. 
[00:34:00]  I fucking was listening to what I like to call the shit show yesterday.  Yeah.  It's your name, Fritz.  No, it's a lot of people.  Believe me.  You started it.  Just ask Adam Walsh.  Yeah, you proved that it's a shit show.  Yeah.  You don't even know people's names.  No.  That's only on a shit show that would happen.  I knew his name.  It was a mistake.  Oh.  Some mistake.  Of epic proportion.  Huge mistake.  Huge mistake.  Epic fail.  Epic fail.  How large a mistake it was.  Yeah.  Very.  But I was listening and I heard a little bit of Patrice with Gallagher. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God.  And that was hilarious.  Yeah.  Fucking unbelievably funny.  Yeah.  Every time Gallagher thought that he had moved on.  Yes.  Patrice brought it back.  Like Gallagher was talking about other countries and you just hear Patrice go, yeah?  What about Africa?  Yeah.  Gallagher whining.  When he did.  What did Patrice say?  Something like your name should be Galm, nigga.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  He wouldn't leave it alone.  Oh, fucking great.  He just kept bringing it back.  Yeah.  I mean, everything.  That's going to be in its entirety this week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everything you could think of we're going to put on.  And I think we mentioned it yesterday, but Patrice was working on a CD.  This isn't one of these things they threw together because Patrice died.  No.  He was getting ready to release a CD and everything was complete.  I mean, this is something that he wanted out there.  Yeah.  Which is kind of cool because sometimes when people die, then, you know, 
[00:35:30]  friends and family try to throw something together, but they're not really sure if this is what  the guy wanted.  But this was Patrice's CD that he was proud of, and it was about to hit.  And it's called Mr. P.  And the reason why it's called Mr. P, which kills me, Jonathan told me yesterday in the  car, is because his stepdaughter used to call him Mr. P, which is just going to make me  fucking lose it again.  But it's on iTunes, and the record company adjusted their deal. 
[00:36:00]  Jonathan said all this yesterday, but I want to make sure we say it again.  Adjusted the deal so the family gets the money.  Yeah, that's great.  Trust me, without getting into it, they need the money.  Okay?  They need the money.  So if you, I mean, if you're a fan of Patrice, and I know a lot of people are like, what can  I do?  What can I do?  You know, simply fucking order the goddamn CD.  It's on Amazon, and it's on iTunes.  It's Mr. P.  It's doing really well on iTunes, but if we can keep it in like the top 10 list.  Yeah, we got to keep it up there for a while.  Yep.  For a while. 
[00:36:30]  But it's called Mr. P.  And Jonathan said, the fucking thing is brilliant.  He says, this thing is brilliant.  Yeah.  So, and I got a copy yesterday, and I popped it into my MacBook, and then I was like, I  can't listen to this yet.  Yeah, it's pretty difficult to listen to certain things, but eh, in time.  In time.  And it's sad, because Patrice, in death, is going to be a massive fucking star.  Yeah.  A massive star.  And it's too bad, because, you know, all this material was out there for the people, 
[00:37:00]  but it takes someone dying for them to discover it, I guess.  Yeah.  It's so weird to me.  But this guy is going to be a massive star.  I was thinking about it, because no one can imitate Patrice.  Yep.  There are comics that are amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  I'm not going to name names, but you see other people imitating them, which almost takes  away from what that guy is.  True.  And with Patrice, I've been thinking hard about it.  It's impossible to imitate this guy. 
[00:37:30]  His take on things and his angle.  You could even try to do his bits word for word, and you're not going to pull it off like  him.  Yeah, that's because it wasn't just going up and doing a character on stage.  Right.  That's him.  Right.  That's who he was.  And he had such a strong personality and brought that right up to the stage.  So if any comic went up there and tried to imitate or take his style, it would never  work.  I really think in this case, it's impossible. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not even almost impossible.  I think this one is impossible.  And that's why this guy is going to be fucking huge in death, man.  Yeah.  Which sucks, because we all knew Patrice very well, and he just wanted fame to call on  his terms.  And we used to joke about it.  We used to go, Patrice, did fame call?  He's like, getting close.  Yeah.  Heard a little shaking of the phone.  It's getting ready.  Yeah.  It would have been nice to see him get to the point where he completely blew us off.  Yeah.  Fame was going to call on his terms, finally. 
[00:38:30]  Real fame.  Yep.  That next level of fame.  Because a lot of people are like, well, he was famous already.  Yes.  But in the world we live in, there are levels of it, and he was ready to go to that next  fucking level.  Yeah.  It'll take a little time for people to discover him and stuff like that.  Word of mouth kind of a thing and stuff like that.  But yeah, I have no doubt.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Motherfucker.  That guy had to fucking say Patrice in the phone call.  I know, right?  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Prick.  I'm not beating anyone up.  I know.  Yeah.  It's even tough to take phone calls about him.  It really is.  We're in the middle of fucking talking about the hairy pussy.  Snitch.  Hairy pussy.  Dirty snatch.  It's odd, though, because even before that guy called up and mentioned Patrice, when we  were talking about hairy pussy and eating hairy pussy and shit like that, I was just thinking  what would Patrice have said about that subject, you know?  Yeah.  You just can't get it out of your mind.  Are you creeped out looking at that spot right there? 
[00:39:30]  I know.  We keep like, anytime you talk about him, you kind of look over at the seat.  Are you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I had a thought, we've got to change something in the studio.  I'm serious.  Yeah?  Because it's creeping me out.  Yeah.  I don't know what.  Just a subtle change.  But it wouldn't creep me out if we had a picture of him in the studio or something.  Something like that would not creep me out.  But just seeing where he used to sit is really bothersome.  Especially like when Jimmy's out, because you know he probably would have been here.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Today, Patrice would have absolutely been in.  Yeah.  Abso-fucking-lutely would have been in.  Yeah.  That sucks. 
[00:40:00]  That sucks.  I'm going to get a little brass plate for my grill and make it the Patrice O'Neill Memorial Grill.  Nice.  Because no one rocked that thing like Patrice did.  Nice.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  Just blows.  Tell people to buy the CD instead of sending flowers.  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  I think flowers, flowers are, I don't know.  Kind of a waste if you think about it.  Oh, dude, man.  If you think about it.  Maybe today's not the day to talk about, but there's some scams going on in that fucking 
[00:40:30]  world.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Please.  It's just like any other business.  This is my guess.  Look at the fucking cover, by the way.  That's cool as shit.  The cover is Patrice O'Neill.  It's called Mr. P, like I said, because that's what his stepdaughter, who's only 11, by the  way, and I'm hearing already has Patrice's inquisitive mind asking a lot of questions all the  time, which is kind of cool, because they weren't blood related, but she fucking picked  up on, you know, what he was all about. 
[00:41:00]  That's what I'm hearing.  I've only met her a couple of times and just kept it very simple.  But yeah, the picture is Patrice fucking decked out like a Mac daddy.  And he's looking at his watch, and behind him is like New York City just zooming by.  Blurred out.  Yeah.  It's got motion blur.  So explain it.  Motion blur.  Thank you, man.  Yeah.  Is that Times Square?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a solid fucking cover.  And Colin Quinn wrote the liner notes, and that'll just bring you to fucking tears,  too.  Colin Quinn did an amazing job on the liner notes. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Colin's the shit.  Oh, yeah.  I'm convinced that the funeral homes have deals with the flower shops.  Oh, yeah.  Because everyone, like, gets flower sent.  They're only there for a day, maybe two.  They're fresh as all hell by the time everyone marches out of the funeral home.  Yeah.  They're not throwing those things away.  So you think they send them back to the flower shop?  Absolutely.  For a kickback, and then they sell them again?  Absolutely. 
[00:42:00]  Wow.  The flower shop now comes back in.  That's a hell of an accusation you're making, Mr.  And goes, here's, well, I'm not talking about a funeral home in particular, right?  Why wouldn't you?  Yeah.  Because the family is gone, and now you've got all these fresh flowers.  Yeah.  And then I'm thinking the flower shop comes back in, fucking makes a little deal, like,  I'll give you whatever amount of money to just take all this out.  Yeah.  And then they go back to the flower shop and pick through it and see what they could,  you know, keep.  True. 
[00:42:30]  And no one would know.  No.  Although, somebody probably would have looked into that by now, if it was happening, you  think?  Well, if these dopes want to look into something, I would fucking get a camera crew, back door,  funeral home.  A shame, shame, shame segment?  Late night.  Where they chase them with the camera.  Hey, are you reselling flowers?  And then also the van with Joe's flower shop appears.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I guarantee there's at least one funeral home out there doing that.  Canary going on.  And then they try to convince you when someone's cremated that you have to buy a coffin. 
[00:43:00]  By the way, this is just from past experience, I swear.  Uh-huh.  And they say, and you'll go, well, why do we need a coffin if he's being cremated?  You know?  Yeah.  Because the presentation looks good.  You've got to have a nice coffin.  And they're like, and besides, we're going to, you know, cremate the coffin along with  the person.  Bullshit!  You think they just...  That's another deal that goes down.  Yeah.  Resell it back to the... 
[00:43:30]  I wouldn't be surprised if your loved one has been, you know, a few of you, they've been  laying in some fucking used coffins.  You are making some accusations.  There's at least one out there.  Yeah.  I didn't name a funeral home.  That's where you would get in trouble with this shit.  It's just my thoughts and talking to people over the years.  Because they're business people, too.  They don't give a fuck.  I'll name one.  Yeah.  Ted's Funeral Emporium.  I bet.  Opie's wrong.  Flowers are saved in the funeral home and taken to the grave. 
[00:44:00]  grave with the person.  No, man.  I've been to enough, unfortunately, grave sites where maybe they take a few flowers.  Not the whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  They'll put a bunch on the casket.  Yeah.  You haven't been to these wakes where it's like wall-to-wall flowers?  You're trying to tell me they bring all those to the fucking cemetery?  Not the ones I've been to.  Oh, well.  That's a florist.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Marcos, you lose today.  Here's Nick in New Jersey.  I knew someone would call. 
[00:44:30]  Nick, go ahead.  Don't mention.  Don't mention.  Not a chance.  All right.  Go ahead.  Not a chance while I mention it.  All right.  Go ahead.  First of all, when you have a funeral, they charge you to take those flowers to the cemetery.  So most people don't take all the flowers to the cemetery.  They take a few.  Right.  Because they charge you.  Yeah.  I've seen the take a few.  And at my grandma's funeral, they gave us all a rose.  Yeah.  And then, you know, we put the rose on the casket, which I was like, this is the dumbest 
[00:45:00]  fucking thing.  Okay.  Well, that's a separate deal with the florists.  They supply the roses, too.  Okay.  Gotcha.  I get into work about 7 a.m.  About 8, we get a call.  Two funeral homes in the area.  We worked in an area where there was like seven or eight funeral homes within about  10 miles.  Right.  Jesus.  So two funeral homes in the area need you there before 930 to pick up flowers.  I would go, and those full tripod stands of flowers, I'd pick up like nine of them, then 
[00:45:30]  a couple of baskets, and then we'd take them back to the funeral home, I mean the florist,  and then the owner and the manager, who was the same family, would pick through them for  good flowers, good vases, and the stands, forget it, the stands are premium.  Those metal stands, the florist never uses a new metal stand, so if they charge you for  one, they're robbing you, because they get them back from every funeral home.  Wow.  But is the funeral home giving you, are you giving the funeral home money to take the 
[00:46:00]  flowers out?  There's some monetary deals.  We had a couple of monetary deals with some of them.  Others would just take, anytime they called up for family things, like, oh, my wife needs  roses and stuff, they'd get them for free.  And then there'd be, whenever somebody came in for flowers, we would recommend certain  funeral homes.  So there's money, there's kickbacks, or there's just plain recommendation and plugs. 
[00:46:30]  Wow.  But it was, dude, I did this for 25 years as a second job, and I want to tell you, I'm  talking about, in the floral business, almost everything is recyclable.  Everything.  I told you.  You had to think.  Yeah.  Because the beauty of it is, you send flowers, which is the right thing to do, you know,  whatever, because people want to do something.  I personally think you should try to find a charity or something, whatever.  But they're sitting there all nice and fresh. 
[00:47:00]  I'm like, no one's grabbing their flowers after this whole thing's done.  You leave the, you can't wait to get the fuck out of the funeral home, right?  You can't wait.  And you don't even want to be a mile from the damn thing.  So it's completely safe for now the florist to come in and grab, you know, their flowers  back.  Guys, I pulled up in the van.  One time, we had to go with three of our vans.  But I pulled up with a van while the family was still pulling out in the funeral procession. 
[00:47:30]  Like, they're pulling up, creating a vacuum, and I'm pulling in behind them, and the doors  open, and the Spanish kids that worked with me would jump out, and we would be in the funeral  room, and we'd be pulling flowers out, and it was, it's almost like that Disney World  thing, where they spray it down, and then they'd do it again.  Yeah, yeah.  My, when my grandma died, you know, she was living in this facility at the end of her life  there. 
[00:48:00]  You're kidding.  And we, a bunch of us, you know, me and a few of my cousins, we decided, I didn't know  about the scam back then.  I was suspicious.  But we were able to grab a bunch of them, and bring it to where she used to, you know,  live, and kind of, you know, give it to some of the residents there, and the staff.  But, here's some death flowers.  Yeah, you could.  What were you going to do with them, you know?  You could always beat them like that, because, you know, there are, you know, those women  will go, oh, I'm going to take this home, and put this on my table, and the funeral home 
[00:48:30]  won't try to stop you.  Right.  If you want to take flowers, and you're a family member.  Yeah, but most don't take them, because they almost feel like that's morbid.  You know what I mean?  Right.  And you don't want to bring them to your own house, because you're like, oh my god, these  flowers were for my uncle.  I don't want them in my house.  I'm glad I could shed some light on that, boys.  You have a great day.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Wow, Pat Duffy's father on the line.  What?  Hey, boys.  Mr. Duffy used to be a florist. 
[00:49:00]  Well, remember Krause's, the wife?  Oh, right, right, right.  I forgot about that.  Everything that guy just said is true.  Let's see.  Yeah.  We even used to dabble in the wedding receptions, too, with the centerpieces and stuff for the  baskets and the balls.  Dabble.  He would dabble.  I love the word dabble.  Yeah, well, the biggest thing, though, like he said, is the stand-up racks for the wreaths 
[00:49:30]  and all that stuff at the funeral?  Yeah.  I mean, we had guys who worked in cemeteries bringing them over, dropping them off.  Oh, shit.  Or they'd call me up, and I'd go in my pickup truck and pick them up.  See?  And the plastic baskets, I mean, they were unbelievable if you bought them brand new,  you know?  And there was money being exchanged, right?  It was, yeah, like around Valentine's Day, you know, we'd make a deal, you know, that  kind of stuff.  Yeah.  You know, Valentine's Day, that's another rip-off, but that's beside the point. 
[00:50:00]  But how do you dabble in Valentine's Day?  Because those flowers are usually the women want to keep.  Yeah, but we buy them.  No, no, I mean the prices.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Oh, yeah.  We used to reserve flowers three months out, and you got them at that price, and they would  deliver to them on that price, you know, that day.  Right, right.  You know, three days, whatever.  You know, that was always a rip-off, whatever.  Hey, were you proud of your son when he was chugging the mashed potato puke at the live 
[00:50:30]  broadcast for your 60th birthday?  Hey, well, Facebook and relatives are still sending, nice kid, nice kid, nice kid.  He's a great kid.  We love Pat.  Oh, yeah, so do I.  All right, sir.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, boys.  Have a good day.  You too.  He's laughing.  He sounds like a lunatic.  Yeah, you know where Pat got it from.  Yeah.  Totally. 
[00:51:00]  Coffins are reused for cremation since they aren't burned.  Yeah, but they'll tell you they're burning the coffin, and that's why, you know, you  got to buy one and blah, blah, blah.  Liar.  But now I'm learning you could rent them.  Oh, yeah?  For $800 to $900.  You could rent a coffin.  Morbid.  I work at a funeral home.  We used to call a church, and they would take them and donate them to old-age homes and  whatnot.  So there you go.  I mean, there's a guy kind of doing the right thing.  Yeah.  I don't think every funeral home's like that.  Why not? 
[00:51:30]  Might as well.  Right?  You might as well.  All right.  All right.  You want a break?  Yeah.  We'll break it into some things.  Oh, the saga of Angel Adams.  Yes.  We will do this next.  What is that?  The saga of Angel Adams.  That fucking bitch.  Does it bother you?  It really bothers me.  It just makes me laugh, though.  When I saw this last night.  No, because that is just a... 
[00:52:00]  That's someone without a clue.  And it's just a burden.  Yeah.  Just a burden.  All right.  We'll explain next.  Coming soon to the Apollo Theater.  That's right.  The one in Harlem.  It's racist Gallagher.  It's not your birthday.  It's your birthday.  And you're not out of breath.  You're out of breath.  That's true.  Oh, if I pick on you guys, it's illegal.  The mustachioed comedian, known for smashing watermelons with a big hammer, is now smashing 
[00:52:30]  the civil rights movement back to 1955.  Without preconceived ideas of what you like, you can't do comedy.  You can't do it without prejudice.  This cutting-edge new brand of comedy will have you in stitches.  Or have him in stitches after you shove that stupid wooden mallet up his bony white ass.  Why don't f***s fart?  Because they don't get assholes until they get married.  It's racist Gallagher live.  I'm just being cutting-edge. 
[00:53:00]  I use these across the country.  I know what's funny.  Coming soon to the Apollo Theater.  One night only, because, quite frankly, we don't think there's going to be a second night.  I guess that's what black people do.  Where are you?  Why are you with me?  Because I need you to notice me.  Where are you?  You, why are you with me?  Cause I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me. 
[00:53:30]  I remember when I met you.  You noticed me, me, me, me, me.  Hurting me, pain me, sad.  Say it about me.  Who were you?  Why are you with me?  Cause I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me.  Who were you?  Why are you with me?  Cause I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me, me. 
[00:54:00]  Pain, hurt, pain, get me hurt.  Me, me, no, me, no, me, no, me, me.  Pain, nerd, sad.  Talk about me.  Sing about me.  Who were you?  Cause why are you with me?  Cause I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me.  Where were you?  Who were you with me?  Cause I need you to notice me, me, me, me, me. 
[00:54:30]  Where are you? 
[00:55:00]  Where are you?

Of course  And now we learn that  Britney Spears is 30 today  Really?  Yeah  I actually thought she was older  You did?  Yeah  Well she kind of looks old  She had already been  She didn't really take care of herself  She's a rough 30  You're not going to convince me otherwise 
[01:01:30]  See now  Three-year-old women look better  Than what she's looking like  If Sexy had been at the board  I know  There would have been a Britney Spears song  I know, I know  And then we'd have played  The little sex bagel thing  And then you said  What's up, Sexy?  Yeah  And he would have said  Well  Yeah  Britney Spears, 30 years old  And then we would have broke down and cried  Yeah  Now he's putting the finishing touches  On the old Patrice thing 
[01:02:00]  Yes  Once again, all weekend  Nothing but Patrice bits  16 hours  And it's not going to be  Four hours played four times  No  It's 16 hours of material  And then that will be run  Like three separate times  If that makes sense, right?  Instead of  Like, I tried to tell people yesterday  It's not like a best of show  We basically  We did it like  When they do pop-up channels  Like when they did the Charlie Sheen channel  Or whatever dopey channels they do  We're turning it  There's a lot of dopey channels 
[01:02:30]  Oh, there's a lot of dopey channels  But we're turning it  A lot of them  We're turning it  You want to name a few, Sam?  I don't  Of course you don't  I will sit here while you do  Gleefully  Gleefully  I think they had a Glee channel  Now that I think about it  But we're turning it  It's going to be  It's a Patrice channel  All week  All Saturday  All weekend long  Right  From 6 a.m. Saturday  Till 6 a.m. Monday  Right  It's just a Patrice channel  So don't  Don't  You know  And it's not a best of  I said 
[01:03:00]  Because we all record a little something  I said it's a taste  It's just a taste  Yeah  You can't  You can't  You can't really pick the best bits  I guess you can technically  But  We could  We could do a month of Takeover channel  With him  Easily  Fucking easily  Yeah  Fucking easily  Fuck  All right  We were going to get to that  Annoying  Oh yeah  The saga of Angel Adams  What do you got on this egg?  Brittany did  Fit a lot of shit in 
[01:03:30]  Like 10 years  From the time she was 20  Till now  Yeah  It's a lot of drama  A lot of sex  Holy mother of fuck  That picture looks good  Yeah  There's a bunch of them  That look really good  God damn  Boy she had a short shelf life though  What do you mean?  As far as like  You know  She was good from  Oh god  I know  Fuck  You forget how  Insanely hot she was  That's why  It's sad  Wow  Wee  Kazowie  Look at that ass 
[01:04:00]  Yeah  It's not sad that she's 30  It's that she's 30  Reminds you of how  She just never really  Took care of herself  How incredibly hot she was  When she first hit the scene  Right  Yeah  Yeah  We used to have her little posters  Up in her office  At N.E.W.  Oh  That used to creep people out  Because she was  I don't know  Maybe 16  17 at the time  Yeah  Yeah  See  You know  You can't get on people  When you think a 16 year old's hot 
[01:04:30]  Because you know  In a couple of years  They're 18  By the way  And then they're smoking  By the way  The Britney Spears  No no  Listen Sam  Yeah  Sam  Let me explain a little something  About our history  Don't judge  I had the Britney Spears poster  Above where I sat  Anthony had  Yes  Which made my poster  Make complete sense  He had a picture of the Olsen twins  Yeah  When they were hot  And the Olsen twins  Are what  Not even 25 today  Really  I don't think so  I think they're 30 
[01:05:00]  No  No  They're younger than Britney Spears  And he had  He had Olsen twins  Above his area  His work area  Those are children  Well  Well yeah  Olsen twins just look like  Fucking  They sell in a handbag now  We had that bit  We couldn't wait  For them to be legal  Yeah  And then they turned legal  And they just  Ugh  What a disappointment  They suck  Olsen twins suck  They just look like  Little fucking alien things  Yeah they suck  And they're so weird looking  They really are right  They're odd 
[01:05:30]  Mmhmm  Odd  Alright let's do this  We got the saga  Of Angel Adams  Angel Adams  How about Ansel Adams  Wasn't he a photographer  I used to be a big  Ansel Adams fan  Were you?  Yeah  What happened?  When you  When you went into  Are you still?  I'll tell you  I'll tell you what happened  I'm surprised  Shut up  He's got one of them  But when they're four  Tops  I'm surprised  This has never come up  On the show before  I  When I was starting  To get into photography 
[01:06:00]  And art in general  Yeah I was a  I was a big  Ansel Adams fan  Yeah  Until I went into  Every single person's  Fucking apartment  And they had an  Ansel Adams  On the wall  Oh yeah  Kind of ruined it  Everyone went  Ansel Adams  Everyone  Everyone  And I kind of just  Got rid of my  Ansel Adams  But when I see him  Online  The pictures and stuff  I always check him out  Yeah  Boy it must have  Sucked  Lighting that big camera  Up to those  Like fucking cliffs 
[01:06:30]  Cliffs and mountaintops  Yeah he's like  Out on a ledge  Yeah  He's out on a fucking ledge  Like ready to fall  And who was taking  His picture  Of him taking a picture  That's a good question  Cause that's like  The guy  And that guy should be famous  Yeah  I don't know  He  To Bear Grylls  You think of  Bear Grylls  Great grandfather  Do you like photography  I do yeah  You do like what though  I don't know  I'm not into like  Abstracty stupid things  Nah I fucking hate that shit  I like 
[01:07:00]  I like a good landscape  You do  Yeah I like a good landscape  I like  I like roads  And paths  Roads and paths  Yep  A path in the woods  You like a good picture  Of a path  I bought  I bought  Yeah I bought  Something basically  Like that  Like a little  A lane  They call that  A lane  I don't know why  I don't know what  That represents  But I'm sure  Some sick fuck  Will turn into  A molestation story  Oh I'm sure  I have to do  I have to do  On this show  Every fucking day 
[01:07:30]  It represents  The bunghole  Right  But maybe  Maybe it just  Represents something  Very fucking  Spiritual and cool  Instead  Instead of a  Fucking finger  In my hiney hole  Sometimes you can  Just enjoy  Thank you  Thank you for having  Logic today  Yeah  I think it represents  Not everything goes back  To molestation  The path where you had to  Run away from the guy  Who was molesting you  Exactly  He was chasing me  In the woods  Exactly  That's the pleasant  Path not taken  Yeah  See that's the  Oh please  You were somewhere  In the woods  Being molested 
[01:08:00]  You know what that is  It's the old dirt road  Opie  It's going up  The old dirt road  I actually searched it out  Here in Manhattan  And it's like  It was like  My buddy Fred  Name's Fred  Finally grabbed it  It's in his house now  But it was probably  Four feet across  Yeah  Two feet  Is this about two feet maybe  Yeah  Yeah  A little more  Two feet up  Like this  Four feet across  Like this  Like this  This  Like this  Like this 
[01:08:30]  How much is that  Almost three right  Oh that's three feet  Alright so it's three feet high  And then maybe five feet across  It was all green  A green  And then a path  In the middle of it  Ah  That's sexual right there  Well I used to like  Mountain biking  And I used to like  I was a big time runner  And so you would find  A lot of paths  To do all that shit on  So I don't know  Maybe it brings me  Back to that time  I think this time  Well that's a bung hole picture  That represents the coulee hole  Yeah of course  That's the hiney right there  It's a wooden walkway  Where the duty comes out  Yeah  Going into like a 
[01:09:00]  Tree covered  Canopy  Kind of  Trail  And it does look like  The bung  The bung  The bung  A fucking cat  Turned me on to  A guy that just  Posts great pictures  He does  And here's an asshole  I like photography as well  Pictures of big titties  Spread vaginal lips  And gaping assholes  Nice  You're a gaping asshole  Yes  I like girls daily  I go there as well 
[01:09:30]  So relax  Oh yeah  That's  That's a good  I know there's  Other people trying to do that  That's a good one  She knows what the fuck  She's doing  If it's a she  If it's a she  If it's a she  I don't know  I like to think  That that's a she  I talk to that person  Every once in a while  But I don't know  If it's a she  A fucking he  A she he  I have no idea  I think it's a lesbian  Yeah  But for some reason  She doesn't want to be  On the show  Which makes me suspicious  That it might be a guy  Making believe  It's a she  Yeah  Because it's a lot more  It's not as creepy  When it's just a girl  Posting 
[01:10:00]  Like nude pics  Of girls  And because of  Because of  I would have to say  Because of me  Yeah  I didn't want her  To go hardcore  With her photos  So now she's got  Another account  That's hardcore photos  Brilliant  Oh  So you keep it  Where it's like  The kind of  Average girl  I like that  You know  Just showing off  Some shit  Yep  And then if you need  More than that  Now she's got  The hardcore site  Those are the ones  I like  The regular  The regular everyday girl  Yes  I don't like them  Stripper looking  Who is  Yes 
[01:10:30]  So what kind of  Photography  Do you like  Well yeah  Good landscape  What else  Do you like  Pictures of  Very famous places  I don't  It doesn't have to be  No  No  Oh god  Earl Douglas'  Photo  Thank you Sam  He's pulling up  Earl's photography  Photography  By  Douglas  He's not  He's not  That bad  Man  Well  How hard 
[01:11:00]  He gets a little  He doesn't  Point your camera  He kind of  Overthinks some stuff  Sometimes when he shoots  But he's not that bad  I've seen great pictures  Taken with the iPhone  I mean  You know  Well the Instagram  Has really helped  Everybody along  Right  Is this  Why does Earl  Just take pictures  Of black people  Oh is this the  Black Rock Coalition book  Yes  Oh no  He's doing  He walks around  New York now  And just takes pictures  Of white people too  Mostly buildings  And then  Maybe a tree in the middle  You know  That's in the way  Of the building  And that represents something 
[01:11:30]  He's trying to be artistic  Oh yeah  Yeah  He's trying  You could make it look  Like you're being artistic  Without knowing anything  About photography  You just gotta do that  Yeah  Put something in the foreground  Yeah  Just click it  Yeah  It's like oh it's a leaf  Yeah  Or that  He had a picture  Shot of the corner  Of a building  Where you  You almost lay down  Oh yeah  Put the camera right  At the corner of a building  And shoot  Right  Straight up  Straight up  It's like really  That's been done  A thousand fucking times  It's Earl Douglas  What is it  Eve Douglas  Five  Two eight 
[01:12:00]  Picture of the  Two eight  The love  Thing  Oh  And everyone thinks  They're the only ones  Taking that picture  Yeah  No Earl  The last picture  It was a skyscraper  And then a tree  Without its leaves  And that was in front  Of the skyscraper  And the skyscraper  Was in the background  Well that sounds grand  There it is  Yeah  Like anyway  Alright look  Anyone could take that  What is he trying  To say there  That's just  Because he's trying  To say something  Yeah  That's not like  Oh this looks cool 
[01:12:30]  He's trying to  Represent something  In that shot  Things that move  Faster than Earl  A tree  And a building  Hey  Oh that's pleasant  What is that  Trees  He likes those trees  Huh  He certainly does  With the crooked  Fucking arms  Crooked branches  Well they look like arms  They certainly do  I think that's what  He's going for  Oh Earl  Like it's an octopus  Octopus out of water 
[01:13:00]  Alright let's do some  Angel Adams  I heard about  Angel Adams  And I did not  I did not look  At the video  It's infuriating  She has a lot of kids  And she wants what  Fifteen kids  That she had  Fifteen kids  That she had  Wow  Fifteen kids  With different daddies  Of course  She's thirty seven  So she's had  Thirty seven  She's had fifteen kids  And she's only thirty seven  Yes  Yes  Each kid takes  About a year  Twelve  Twelve of the kids 
[01:13:30]  Are minors  Not minors  Minors  And her husband  Boyfriend  Fiance  Whatever it was  Fiance I think  Which means  Baby daddy  Is now in prison  Go figure that out  Right  And she now  Is demanding  That someone  Pay for her  And her children  Really  To live  And eat  And be clothed  And she  Is so adamant  That she  For some reason 
[01:14:00]  Deserves  To have people  Pay for her  And there's not  A hint of humility  Or embarrassment  Or anything  She demands  She's demanding  That people  Take care of her  And her chidgens  Is she  On the welfare  The food stamps  She's on  All kinds of stuff  So she's already  Getting help  But not enough  But not enough  Not enough  It's not enough  Why did she have  Fifteen kids  Exactly  Because she can't  Keep her fucking  Cunts shut  My mom 
[01:14:30]  Once bitched  That you know  She had  Five births  I guess  Right  Five  Because I have  Twins in my family  Oh  Yeah so she was  Pregnant five times  And had six kids  And she  She openly admitted  The reason why  She had so many kids  Was because of the church  Really  No birth control  No she was old school  No birth control  Because you go to hell  And burn for eternity  And all that shit  So then she  Went to the church  You know  It's well documented  That we went through 
[01:15:00]  Some very poor stages  In our lives  Yeah  And then also  My dad had money  It was the weirdest  Fucking thing  But she went to the church  Looking for help  Like hey man  The only reason  I had six kids  Oh man  Was because you know  I'm following the faith  Right  And then they pretty much  Shut the door in her face  And said good luck to you  You know  Maybe we can get you  A few hand me down  Fucking pairs of pants  Or something  Yeah  That's about all  We can do for you  Well I don't think  This broad here  Is doing it for the church  Because she's got  Different daddies  She's not married  Right  And I think she just 
[01:15:30]  Liked the feeling  Of black cock in her  Yeah  But I always liked  The logic that  You know  That was some good  Logic from my mom  Yeah  If you asked her  She probably would have  Had three or four  Not six  You know  Maybe four  Maybe  Because she knew  You know  You shouldn't have  A lot of kids  If you can't afford them  Well true  You know  That's just being smart  About it  Well this woman  Has no clue  Okay  And like I said  No humility  Are we playing it from there?  No  Because this is a ten minute clip  Yeah 
[01:16:00]  Oh fuck that  We got some highlights  Here's the first highlight  In my case  They haven't been in my life  Six months  And I'm homeless  Thirty seven year old  Angel Adams  Blames the system  For her problems  A system of social service agencies  Trying to help her  Adams has fifteen children  Twelve who are now  Living with her  In this small motel room  While we were in the room  The children  Had no food available  No shoes  And Adams says  They haven't had a change of clothes  In more than three days  Landlords  Recently evicted Adams 
[01:16:30]  And her children  From this Tampa apartment  After discovering  She was living there  With her twelve children  The kids clothes  Books  Toys  And furniture  Are now out on the curb  Picked over by scavengers  The building's owners say  They gave ample warning to Adams  Warnings  They say  She chose to ignore  We tried to help them  And  And  I think several  Other agencies  You know  With the paying of her rent  And the paying of her utilities  And stuff  You know  Did more than their part 
[01:17:00]  I'm with you  Oh  God  No problem here  I'm infuriating  And that isn't even  The most infuriating clip  Yeah I know  Yeah  People ask  What has changed  You know  When I became a father  These type of stories  Fucking  Just drive you insane  I can't imagine  That a kid's not being  Taken care of  I can't fucking fathom it  They haven't even had  A change of clothes  In days  No food  That place must stink  Holy shit  Can't they just take  The kids from this woman  And give these kids a shot 
[01:17:30]  Well  Maybe  Alright  Angel wants to know  Who's gonna pay  Yeah  But Adams says  Her life didn't start  To fall apart  Until social service agents  He's got involved  Really  Her fiance  Gary Brown Sr  The man who fathered  10 of her 15 children  Was arrested  And Adams says  She was left with nothing  I don't have any clothes  People been donating food  Just around here  Just helping me out  With food 
[01:18:00]  And I don't have anything  We called the Department  Of Children and Families  To see what they've been  Doing to help  DCF says  Hillsborough Kids Incorporated  Has been helping  By paying Adams rent  Even providing her furniture  Adams says  It isn't enough  Somebody needs to pay  For all my children  And my  And Gary  All our suffering  All our pain  Somebody needs to be  Held accountable  And they need to pay  You should be held  Accountable  Can you fuck it 
[01:18:30]  You fucking had 15 kids  That tipped me off  In my house last night  Because I saw the link  Right  I clicked on it  Right  It was tweeted  And I started watching it  And when that part came on  I was alone in my house  Yelling  Yelling the N-bomb  Like a fucking madman  Calling her  The worst possible things  Oh I  Oh it's fantastic  That's that's  Again my neighbor's like  Oh boy  That's lunacy man  What's the logic  Of having 15 kids 
[01:19:00]  There is no logic to it  She was  She's a fucking whore  A leech  A burden to society  Holy shit  And again  Do you see how  There's just no  There's no accountability  There's no humility  There's no embarrassment  She's just like  Someone needs to pay  Someone needs to pay  For my suffering  And my chidgens  Well the word that got me  Was accountability  Yeah yeah  You're the one that  Got yourself into this  Yeah  Close your fucking 
[01:19:30]  Smelly snatch  Yes Sam  No no  Sam  You raised your mic  Oh shit  That means you're ready to talk  Well I can talk if you want  I just didn't want to interrupt  It's not  You raised your mic  Watch this  I got something to add  Okay  Who gives a fuck  Days later  Angel goes to court  And is put in jail  For contempt  Really  Oh yeah  What's this about  Why did she have to go to court  It didn't say in the news story  Why she was going to court  I'm assuming  That it's not a terribly 
[01:20:00]  Uncommon occurrence  For her to be in court  It's not like  A crazy thing  That she was in court  Right  Please  Please  If there is a god  This ends with the kids  Being taken away from her  Please  Oh please  Oh please  Oh please  Give these kids  A fucking chance  She doesn't strike me  As somebody who  Exudes personal responsibility  These kids don't have a chance  It's over Johnny  Well  How young are they  There's enough of them  How young are they  If they're young enough  They could  They could have a chance  They're literally ranging  From two 
[01:20:30]  To  Out of the house  You know  Probably twenty years old  Oh yeah  Those guys are fucked  But maybe the young'uns  Really  Maybe we could save  A few of the young'uns  In a foster home  With a daddy in prison  And a fucking whore mother  That doesn't take care  They're just fucked up  DCF regional director  Nick Cox  Stepped in  And moved Angel  And her children  To a kid's place  In Brandon  As a temporary home  But Angel  Remained defiant  In court last week  Hillsborough County  Judge Tracy Sheehan  Asked Angel  A pointed question 
[01:21:00]  At a status hearing  Are you pregnant?  Sheehan demanded to know  Because she was concerned  Adams had been with a man  In front of the children  At the motel room  Or in a small  Two bedroom apartment  She had lived in  Before being evicted  Take her away deputies  When Adams refused to answer  Sheehan sent her to jail  For contempt of court  She might be pregnant?  The judge  That was the thing  Yeah, they asked  If she was pregnant  Because then there was  There was some kind of  A deal where they  They thought she might have  Had some sexual activity 
[01:21:30]  In front of the children  Oh my god  And they asked her  If she was pregnant  And she wouldn't answer  The question  So  Because they're all living  In one tiny little room  Yeah  So that means she would  Be having sex  In front of kids  Right  What a piece of garbage  She is a waste  Of life  What a piece of garbage  Jay, black guy, Cleveland  I say black guy  Because it's important  To the discussion  I guess, Jay  Because I don't give a fuck  Go ahead, Jay  Alright, man  And usually  Most of the time  Every time you call

Oh, well  Look at that  It's actually  It's called CoonTube  But they're using the tube  Yeah, they got the tube  I thought it was YouTube  Yeah  Because, you know  In the peripheral  You just kind of see  The YouTube logo

[01:26:00]  For using that Tube logo  Oh, my God  It says  She-Nig  Easily outmanned by She-Nig  And I guess it's two ladies  Having a little brawl  Outside of an apartment complex  I do love watching black girls scrap  When they're going at it  That's a lot of fun  Oh, yeah  A lot of fun  To see the weaves being ripped out  Oh, yeah  The weaves  Jay, you got anything else?  No  That's it, Joe  Thank you, sir  Did you eat the blueberry pie? 
[01:26:30]  Blueberry pie  The most popular  But the website is crashed  It's good to see our listeners  Have such good taste  And the number one advertiser  On every video  Is a giant banner  That is  N  Mania  Oh, right  The website that started it all  And  Coontube is down  Oh, it's down  We crashed it  This is horrible  How the hell are we supposed to function  In a world without Coontube 
[01:27:00]  We'll function just fine  They're keeping the white man down  They certainly are  So, let's get back to Angel Adams  Last we left you  She was being arrested in court  Because she didn't behave in fucking court  Yeah  She wouldn't answer the judge's question  About whether or not she was pregnant  If she was pregnant  And was impregnated  In front of her  Why would you get pregnant so many times?  What is that about?  She's a mental patient  Angel apologizes for her behavior to the judge 
[01:27:30]  Today, at yet another hearing  Sheehan released Adams from jail  I called in everyone to say  I have no interest in leaving her in jail  Because I think to do so  Just burdens the taxpayers of Hillsborough County  Even further  Then DCF Regional Director Nick Cox  Updated the court on the children  They appear to be doing very well  And finally, Angel Adams spoke  Surprising everyone  To your question of me being pregnant  No, I am not pregnant  And no, my children have not been around any men 
[01:28:00]  Outside of their father  Adams went even further  Apologizing to the court  And to DCF  And I do want to apologize to you  And say I'm sorry to everybody in the room  You know, I understand  That these people have went out of their way  To get a house for me and my children  The children remain in state custody  DCF is working with family members  To place the children in homes with family members 
[01:28:30]  So they are putting the kids in homes  Good  Hopefully good homes  And hopefully maybe a few will fucking make it  Hopefully  I mean, that's what I'm saying  I'm with you  I think the odds are against it, man  Absolutely  I think there's enough  One or two could end up okay  There's 15, don't forget  15 kids?  Odds are that one of those kids  Is going to do something of substance  Fuck  I can afford to have 15 kids  I don't want 15 kids 
[01:29:00]  I like kids  Maybe a couple more  But that's it  They are going to  Turn into criminals  I'm not saying like  One of them is going to be the president  I'm just saying there will be one  That may like have a job  And  Criminals  Not be a criminal  One or two  Criminals  What do you think?  There's a George Washington cover in there?  Maybe  I don't think so  Why didn't J-Lo take the time  To drive her Fiat around the Bronx?  Yeah, you hear about that?  I was on it  Yeah  I tweeted that shit fucking early on 
[01:29:30]  I said, bullshit  She's driving around in the Bronx in a Fiat  And then it comes out that she wasn't  They were using what?  A double or something?  Yeah  She couldn't even drive back to her own neighborhood  To make a good payday  She's still Jenny from the block  No, she's not  A, she would never be caught dead in a Fiat  Unless she was being paid a lot of money  And B, she wouldn't be caught dead in her old neighborhood  Yeah  She has moved the fuck on  Don't be fooled by the rocks  No  That she's got 
[01:30:00]  That's right  She's still Jenny from the block  Yeah  One more clip from Angel Adams  Oh, great  They used a double?  The criminal maker  It came out that J-Lo used a double?  Yeah  Yeah, she used a double  A bloody double  I got it  Prestige  Yeah  Fuckin' love  You could see me at the Pantages  Oh  Oh  The last time we saw Angel Adams 
[01:30:30]  She was getting out of jail on contempt charge  Judge releasing her  Because all 12 of her minor children  Are now in protective custody  And now more trouble  Only a day after Adams released from jail  Police had to be called  Deputies say Adams and her sister  In front of the children  Became profane and abusive with shelter workers  Court papers say Adams got angry  When a social worker referred to herself  As the children's house mother  The judge repeated Adams' words 
[01:31:00]  Quote, she ain't your f***ing mama  And who the f*** do you think you are  Having them call you mama?  Is that what she said?  My client denies saying it, Your Honor  Were people cursing in front of the kids?  Well, it was back and forth  Yes, sir  Yes, ma'am  Then in front of a small army  Of social workers and lawyers  Adams hedged on visiting the kids  In front of a psychiatrist  Your Honor, my client's just concerned  That the more that she does  The more the department wants her to do 
[01:31:30]  In order to get her children back  You know, it's always one more thing  Ms. Adams  It's not like, let's make a deal over here  You don't want to visit  With our rules, you don't visit  And deputies say Adams has been banned  From the shelter where her children are staying  They say she and her sister  Threatened to harm the social workers  Who are caring for them  That's good  That's good  You started this whole f***ing mess  Is she a drug addict?  Boy, they didn't bring that up  Doesn't seem like it, right?  No, she doesn't seem 
[01:32:00]  She just seems like a  I would assume she's mentally ill  Yeah, there's some kind of  There's some kind of problem there  That makes her get jism in her vagina  And have children  Look at what a jamoke her lawyer is  I know  A jamoke  That's the first thing I thought of  He's one of those guys  He's one of those guys  That would sit in the hot tub  Looking like a dummy  Looking like a dummy  One of my favorite things  Like when Biggie was just rapping  He was just a dummy in the hot tub 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, just sitting in that hot tub  Looking like a dummy  He does look like a jamoke  He is, he's just a jamoke  He doesn't know what he's doing  Did Iraq go home yet?  I don't think so, no  Because, you know, the Nagel seed  Is very valuable  I would like to know how close  He's probably terrified with this story  Of course he is, man  Aw, yeah  Aw, yeah  The Nagel seed  It's all value  Prince Nagel  It's royalty  It's Floridian royalty  It's Floridian gold in that condom 
[01:33:00]  They call it Floridian gold?  Yes  Florida's main exports are oranges  And Nagel semen  And we all know that  You know, born and raised in Florida  So  Yeah, from day one  It's more valuable than gold  In Florida  People are selling it  Yeah  Let's go to Holly, man  Hey, guys  Are you Holly St. Pete on Twitter?  Yes  See, I fucking pay attention out there  Wow  What's going on, Holly?  Well, listen  Well, obviously I live in Tampa  And this story is really old 
[01:33:30]  And I don't understand why it's coming back around  Oh, is it?  It's from April 2010  Well, it's been  It hit the old internet  And went kind of viral this week  So I don't know why it's out there  So what happened in the year since?  Is she all respectable  And earning her own keep  And raising her kids?  College tuitions  I totally forgot about it  Until you guys brought it up  But the reason why she lost her house  Was her boyfriend  Who actually is father to quite a few of the children  Yeah, ten  They were in Section 8 housing, obviously 
[01:34:00]  And he was selling cocaine to pay the rent  All right  Sure, you're going to get that paper  He got arrested for selling cocaine  And then they were not able to pay the rent anymore  Because there wasn't a, you know, wage earner in the house  Burden gotta eat  And it was just a nightmare  I don't know whatever happened to those kids  Of course, they never talk about it anymore  They just drop it and it goes away  But they ended up 
[01:34:30]  That she was behind on the rent  You know, and they paid the Tampa Housing Authority  That's where the rent went to  And they ended up paying the $6,000 in back rent that she owed  What? Why?  Because she was such a pain in the ass  She was on the news every day  She was in court freaking out  Screaming at the judge  And the whole nine yards  And she was just a wackadoodle  Well, language  It's appropriate, though, in this case  Yes, a wackadoodle  But anyways, I tweeted you the article from back then 
[01:35:00]  And it kind of explains the whole situation  Oh, look at you  I thought I was smooth with the tweet plug  Now we need to know what your Twitter is officially  So we can see the tweet  Holly in St. Pete  But you do S-T, right?  Yes, S-T-P-E-T  S-T-P-E-T  Right  Let's see  Oh, yeah, okay  I've seen you before  What is that?  Yeah, I've been around  No, I've clicked on a couple of links 
[01:35:30]  Yeah  Things like that  Thank you, I feel special  Oh, and there's a missing one  What?  Nothing, it just happens  I didn't  What?  He can't help himself  I didn't say anything  All right  Thank you, Holly  Uh-huh, bye  Bye  Holly from Tampa  They won't let her fiancé get his hustle on to pay that rent  People are asking what you  Get his hustle on  Well  It's a shame  He's a dummy drug dealer  How stupid do you have to be to get caught selling cocaine in Florida? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, really  Think about it  That's all they do  That's the third export  Their economy, yeah  It's based on it  You got to be doing something ridiculous to be caught selling cocaine in Florida  I want to talk to him so bad, but he's busy  He's not busy  He's so busy  He's dumb up  He's so busy, the Nagel  Yeah  No?  Come to the studio  Eric, Eric  Yeah  Oh, he's very busy  He's got to get his shit together  Oh, God  You know, I didn't mention it yesterday 
[01:36:30]  We lost another person that was associated with this show  Oh?  For the old timers  Oh, right, right  For the old timers  Yeah  You guys remember blind boxing?  It was one of our greatest bits we've ever done  No, it's not Blind Dave  Don't get scared  Oh, no, no  Blind Dave, if you remember  That's how we pretty much really got to know him  And he agreed to do this blind boxing thing  We're not allowed to do this  We haven't been allowed to do this since we did it 
[01:37:00]  Ten some odd years ago  Yeah  And the videos are online somewhere  Yep  And basically two blind guys, boxing gloves, beating the shit out of each other  Just look for my watermark  Right  And we almost lost Blind Dave because he had a, what, a bruised spleen, broken ribs  All sorts of shit  Got the shit beat out of him  Yeah, he got the shit kicked out of him by this kid, at the time a kid, from Long Island  Yeah  Who came in full of life with a dog  He got around great as a blind guy 
[01:37:30]  And he was the one, if you remember  I'm talking to the old timers now  Who popped his eyes out and really grossed us out  Oh, right  To prove he was blind  He had two glass eyes  And he lost his sight to cancer when he was a kid  Well, the cancer came back and got him  And there was a big, big, over-the-top obituary in the paper yesterday  The guy ended up doing real well with his life and working for the mayor's office  Yeah  You know, for disability organizations and stuff 
[01:38:00]  Yep  He was one of the main guys for the mayor as far as disabilities went  And he was only like 40, 41, 42 as well  Yeah  But  He lost his sight at like five years old to optic nerve cancer  Holy fuckaroni  Keep believing in your God  Oh my God  You can't give the person something a little easier  Oh my God  And then it creeps back on him fucking 35 years later  I don't know, yeah  Probably  Yeah  Oh, yeah  Yes 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, because he was like five years old or something  Oh, terrible  But his picture was in the paper yesterday  I'm like, holy fuck, that guy  He was cool as shit  Yeah  So  Yeah  You want to talk to Jordan?  What does Jordan have to do?  Oh, no  He was trying to get through the after show today  And he was tweeting that he was going to give me a beating or something  You're going to give Sam a beating, Jordan?  Well, I'm not going to give him a beating  But he's very fucking close to it 
[01:39:00]  Why is that?  Because I was on hold for like fucking two hours yesterday  And I was expecting to get on to the wall  That's his fault, really?  Yeah  Is that his fault?  Did he prevent you from hanging your phone up, sir?  We've had guys that have been associated with this show for 10 plus years  That have waited hours on the phone and we never got to them  It's a privilege  And then they just assume, all right, yeah, they were way too busy for me today  Yeah, well, Sam, you look like fucking Jonah Hill  And Joaquin Noah from the Bulls fucked and had an eighth baby  Oh, shit! 
[01:39:30]  I love those when you say you look like one and look like another  And you put them together  That is hilarious  Somebody else tweeted that exact  Clever every time  Yeah, but he took that line from somebody  It was tweeted to me  No  No, he tweeted to you, Sam  He probably tweeted it  Sam  What do you got, brother?  What do I got, bro?  I'm going to chime in on the Angel Adams thing  Oh  Riff, my friend, riff  She is a complete fucking chutzpah  Oh, my God  What's that?

You got a lot of those Kardashian jokes  Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's a hot topic, though  She's always around in the news  Yeah, well  She's a pop culture phenomenon, so it's good to go with that  Jordan keeps it topical  That's right, brother  I got to keep it topical  Because right now she's in this big divorce annulment dispute 
[01:40:30]  And I don't blame Kris Kardashian  I don't blame Kris Humphreys  God, I just call freaking Kris Kardashian  But no, I totally side with Kris Humphreys  Because she definitely is a fraud  Because she fucked the whole NBA and NFL roster  A lot of cats  A lot of cats  God damn  A lot of cats  She loves that blackhawk because  No wonder why her ass is so fucking big  Because all the blackhawks are still stuck up there 
[01:41:00]  Oh!  Goddamn!  I don't know how that works  Holy shit  This fucking guy is a pisser  I get that  Well, this whole fucking Angel Adams  Like, it's just a fucking sad example of how our country just lets fucking black people  Who have no regard for any social services  Just to fucking keep leeching off the government  It's fucking sad  I see it all the time  Jordan's a racist?

What do you got?  We gotta move on  You gotta move on?  Oh, I guess you don't want  Yeah, we don't  You're right  Did you hear the story of Angel Adams?  She got pregnant 15 times  And all we were thinking was  How scared you would be 
[01:48:00]  Because of the Nagel seed  The valuable Nagel seed  Yeah  What if she found one of those  Precious condoms in the garbage?  Well, I'd be more concerned  That I was sleeping with her  To begin with  Whoa  You don't like black people?  Is that what it is?  The black thing?  I don't like trash  Ooh  You don't like black people?  What?  I've never been with one  I don't know  I don't know  I didn't know people  That were born and raised in Florida  Were so racist  I know, right?  There are a lot of racists in Florida  A lot of racists?  I'm not saying arrogant  There are a lot of racists  There are a lot of racists in Florida  But I'm from Long Island  What? 
[01:48:30]  No, no  Yes  Don't do it  Get that out of your head  That's stupid  I'm from Long Island  Exactly  I'm from Long Island  You're not a Long Islander  I was born and raised in Long Island  You gotta get that thought out of your head  No one's gonna believe that ever again  Is that one of the coastal little places in Florida?  South Shore, Long Island?  Yes  Oh  Oh  Oh, South Shore  Excuse me  Yeah  What part of Long Island do you claim to be from?  Miami Beach  Miami Beach, Long Island  Is there a town? 
[01:49:00]  East Islip  East Islip  I lived in East Islip  I know  I went to school in East Islip  I know  You're no East Islip  My friend  Sorry  East Islip  Go to Timber Point Elementary School?  That I did  What a coincidence  We talked about this before  Are you going home?  In a little while  So why don't you tell everybody about the Patrice special  Because I know you were working on that  It is awesome  It is 16 hours of not even the best of Patrice 
[01:49:30]  Just like all  I mean it was just too much to fit in even to 16 hours  Yeah, that's why I said it's a taste  Yeah  We could do a whole week easily  I mean in the coming months and certainly in the next year  You'll hear a lot of Patrice on this channel  A lot of stuff that's favorites to everybody  Some stuff that I had no idea that we even talked about is in there  A bunch of people did little testimonials and shared some memories of Patrice 
[01:50:00]  It was done really well  And you told me last night you got a hold of Warren Haynes  Yes  Warren Haynes was on a bus to Boston  And he remembers the day that Patrice sang with him  And what did you tell me?  Warren Haynes even thought it was weird he picked that song out  Yeah  And especially once he heard that he had passed  And he was thinking back on that  And he's just like  That is just  It was really fucked up that  That was the song he picked  Like he was predicting that he was going to go  Right  Did you get him to record anything or no? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah  Warren Haynes?  That's awesome  We should play the original by Howling Wolf  It's the song Patrice sang on our show last May  Yeah  You can get it on YouTube because I checked it out  And you can tell that Patrice knew the song really well  Because he sang it pretty close to the original  So it starts what?  Tomorrow morning?  Tomorrow morning at 6am  Okay  And it'll run all weekend until 6am Monday morning  Yeah  And it's 16 hours of material  Played what?  Three different times I guess?  Is what it comes down to?  Yeah  More or less  It's three times  Alright 
[01:51:00]  There's a lot of good stuff in there  Unmasked will be in there too  Unmasked is in there  Some highlights of his old Black Phillip show  Yep  Are in there  One of my favorite bits is when  You guys were talking about  The death of Saddam Hussein  Overshadowing the one of James Brown  And he was arguing how James Brown's death was more important  And how he would close out the concert to the insurgents  By singing Bewildered  Who could have some of that? 
[01:51:30]  It's just amazing  Alright cool  I don't know if I'll be able to listen  It was difficult putting it together  Yeah  You start sitting there listening for a while  I know you guys brought up  I think you brought up  The Gallagher stuff earlier  But  Rock coat  And it's raining stuff  Talking about his mom  Independence Day  Exotic meats 
[01:52:00]  Like whale blowhole  And cheetah heels  Did you  Remember that one?  Did you include the time he got real serious?  With the trouble he got into in Boston  That was like such a complete bullshit thing  That happened to him?  I think it's in a few parts  Because there's one where he talks about  Not being able to get into Canada  Right  Which relates to that  There's parts where he talked about  Being in trouble where his mom had to hide him  Right  Oh okay  So you got some of that  But I think it's not really concentrated in one thing 
[01:52:30]  I think it's spread out through a couple of  Right  Alright  Very good  So that starts tomorrow at 6 a.m.  And once again  Patrice's brand new CD that he put together  He was about to release this damn thing  You can pre-order it now on iTunes and Amazon  And we're featuring that track as well for the weekend  Yeah  From Mr. P  But they readjusted the whole deal with the record company  So most if not all of the money is going to Patrice's family  And they need the money  Okay  I'll just say that much 
[01:53:00]  So you know  For all the people saying what can I do  You know at the very least just order the new CD Mr. P  And the name is because his stepdaughter used to call him that  Which  It was coming in on feedback during the after show  That after we announced it and played it  It shot to number 3 on iTunes  I heard number 1  That was within an hour  It was number 1  Yesterday afternoon it was number 1 in comedy  And it was in all of iTunes  Music, everything  It was number 33  Which is really good  Wow  For a comedy album  It was number 33 overall in iTunes 
[01:53:30]  It could have gone higher  But that's when I checked  Right  Which is huge  Are we promoting that all weekend?  Yeah  It's in the special  We're promoting that  We're promoting sales for Elephant in the Room  Right  Everything  Okay  Very good  Very good  Jordan's back  And Bobo's back  Oh wow  Let me  This could be good  Let's get Matt in here while we're at it  Yeah  Let me start with Bobo  Bobo I gotta tell you  This Jordan guy is killing it on our show  And you might be yesterday's news  Well that guy's Jordan just has 3D stories alright

[02:14:00]  All right, he doesn't even want to talk, he's driving.  Wow, that's silly.  Well, that's stupid.  Wow, great job.  Unfortunately, I see this bus driver that would have been a perfect player if he had XM.  I don't know what he's even talking about.  Because there was this one bus driver, and I remember you used to listen a lot when you guys were on in the afternoon. 
[02:14:30]  No one cares.  I mean, really.  It really is.  All right.  I mean, we're going to have to decide who gets the title of the biggest dummy on the show.  I'm not really sure what I'm getting to right now.  We'll throw it to the audience and see what they say.  Yeah, it's either Jordan or Bobo.  Loser gets banned, right?  Stay tuned.  Yeah, yeah, loser gets banned from the show for life.  After being kicked in the balls.  Yeah, lifetime. 
[02:15:00]  Lifetime ban.  All right, Bobo, good luck to you.  Good luck, Bobo.  All right, good luck.  Whoever wins, wins.  Good sportsman.  Whoever wins, wins.  Good sportsman.  That's what he says.  All right.  May the best idiot win.  Drive his license, buddy.  All right, Jordan.  He's getting a state ID.  What's wrong with you?  State ID?  Oh, yeah.  God, I don't know what's worse, losing two fucking Bobo or a gay quarterback.  That was a thinking man's line right there. 
[02:15:30]  That was a thinking man's line.  You had to pause and really let it sink in.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, we all just stopped and had to think that one.  Holy fuck is that clever.  Those are the best ones, though, when you finally do get it.  Yes.  Yeah.  The more you think about it, the less sensitive.  Yeah.  And the second I do get it, I'll let you know.  I'm starting to think Jordan wouldn't be in a hot tub looking like a dummy.  He'd drown.  I don't want to be in a hot tub, fuck.  All right, Jordan.  Good one.  Good one, man, because he likes being in hot tubs.  Right.  Hot tubs suck.  Yeah, they're terrible. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  Well, fucking juice in the ovens don't go really well, so that's why I never worked in a pizza place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I think you went over the line on that one.  Yeah, I mean, that's totally uncalled for.  That's uncalled for.  I'm part Jewish.  Oh, then it's hilarious.  Yeah.  Okay, you're allowed to say stuff like that.  Down with the tribe?  Oh, all right.  All right.  Then it's funny, you know.  Yes, yes.  All right.  That's hilarious.  I mean, we were scared to laugh, but now that we know you're Jewish, now it's okay.  Yeah, yeah.  You can say horrible jokes about the Holocaust because you're Jewish, right? 
[02:16:30]  Bobo.  Yeah.  You hang up.  You have any jokes, Bobo?  Is he Tim Wadley?  Oh, yeah.  Of course I do.  I forget.  I forget they should have took that.  I think God should have took the president over for truth if he had to take that.  Oh, the Secret Service.  Now the Secret Service and the other thing. 
[02:17:00]  Not only do you have a massive lawsuit to deal with, now you're going to have to deal with  the Secret Service.  The Secret Service is going to be all over your shit now.  Oh, that's stupid.  Bobo, they should have taken you over, Patrice.  You're a fucking waste of sperm.  Oh, man.  Come on.  And I want to make it perfectly clear.  I had no idea that fucking asshole was going to say what he just said.  No, that's terrible.  I ain't dealing with that shit this weekend.  He speaks for himself.  Right.  Good luck, Bobo.  All right, Bobo.  We got to let you go. 
[02:17:30]  I have a feeling there's a black van in your future.  Yeah.  Oh, crack it up, Jordan.  That's it.  All right, Bobo's gone.  All right.  So is Jordan.  That absolutely should not have been on the radio.  Fucking idiot.  Jordan, thank you.  I couldn't help.  Shut up.  I like that Jordan thinks he's smarter than the whole thing.  Like, it's just us against Bobo.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Jordan and us and stuff against Bobo.  Just kind of riffing together.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, wait.  He's keeping up.  All over our face.  Of course, I ate the blueberry pie.  People talk about the economy's bad.  And we didn't do it.  We were the ones fighting.  But they got the blueberry pie all over their face.  They were the ones eating the pie.  And, of course, you ate it, Fatso.  He looks like such an idiot going,  They were the ones eating the pie.  The pie.  By the way, because I'm getting killed,  I said sediment instead of sentiment.  Oh, you did?  And they're killing me for it. 
[02:18:30]  Bobo would say it's sediment.  They're killing me for it.  It's sediment.  I'm getting killed over that one.  Yeah.  All right.  You said it with the wrong cinnamon.  Cinnamon.  Cinnamon.  I like cinnamon toast.  Cinnamon toast.  Cinnamon toast crunch.  Right.  It's a good cereal.  Right.  Who's this?  This is Jordan.  Oh, God.  Fuck.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, you got, I think you hit the receiver again on me.  And?  The receiver.  It signals the end of the phone call.  Here it's us.  And?  Yeah.  You had to use your brain for like two seconds on that one, huh? 
[02:19:00]  I'm just kidding.  Oh, okay.  It's all in good fun.  It's all in good fun.  It's all in good fun.  How could someone, like, just make you hate him so much on the phone?  I don't know.  I could despise him.  It makes people really like Bobo, which I never thought it'd see happen.  That was funny when Bobo went on the bus and asked everybody and then no one said anything.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  What?  Who should be the big dummy on the bus? 
[02:19:30]  Did you hear the excitement in his voice when he found out the bus driver had heard of  Open App?  Uh-huh.  Oh, you have?  Oh, yeah.  Have you heard of Bobo?  Just heard of Bobo.

[02:24:30]  you probably aren't going to do a lot of online playing i have one controller i'm not pretending  i never bought a second controller yeah but isn't because i only play right now i only play tiger  woods i like my golf games yeah yeah and i want people to if they really know what they're doing  i'll fucking play them because that's fun but i can't sit through like how does this work like  what do you do that is they're getting 18s on holes and i just want to like you know fucking  play yeah there's no fun in it for me i like when people are bad at video games because i'm not good 
[02:25:00]  oh really so if they don't know how to play at all that's the only time i win but yeah but i also  but i'm also like i understand it the other way too i suck at like uh john madden and they were playing  a lot of john madden this past thanksgiving i didn't step in because i could tell they were  really into it and i wasn't gonna be like well how do you fuck it no how do you you don't want  to be that person no do you run here i i run here yeah i read the room and i realized like my nephews 
[02:25:30]  and a few other people were really into playing each other i'm like okay that there's no way they  want me in on this yeah you know i knew and you know yeah you know that you're not just gonna try  to jump in oh my god they can't get enough the old guys beating the shit out of each other the  fighting video still all over tv old codgers fucking newt huh newt gingrich he's at the uh  he's at the forefront right now he seems to have a little more steam than these other the past  republican uh front runners in the primaries here um yeah yeah i like uh and soon as i say this people 
[02:26:00]  gonna fuck it they're gonna attack me oh yeah yeah this is i like his honesty man and then people  like well actually he's not really honest how can you say that look at his record honesty you're a  dick right i like how he's just kind of taking everyone to task as they say he tasks me and i  shall have him for it yeah he's pretty he's pretty blunt yeah and this herman cain let's let's all be 
[02:26:30]  honest this guy's a pathological liar it's fucking creepy it really is i don't know i don't know  shit but i would bet a lot of money he had a 13 year affair with this woman oh yeah and he's like  how he explains shit on tv with all the cameras rolling i'm like holy fuck this guy's a pathological  liar he really tries to uh lie about it but but leave a little bit of plausible deniability which 
[02:27:00]  just makes him look bad right why would they why would they feel like they have to attack his  character there was no way he was ever going to be president he was fun to watch and stuff and if  they wanted to go after him they would probably go after some uh business ethics maybe yeah which  is a little easier than like convincing women to come out of nowhere to say they had sex with them  to have so many come forward and he's got an excuse for every single one of them it's just who was  calling him out and he goes uh i i'm not gonna be a detective here was that john stewart a detective 
[02:27:30]  it was a clip that hit the hit uh all over the place this morning i'm not gonna be a detective  because they're like well isn't there oh is that was it sean hannity it might have been a sean hannity  clip sean yeah yeah you got that clip i'm looking for the clip itself and then you listen you're like  holy fuck i think he believes this shit even though it's not real that's just it he really which is the  definition of a pathological liar right you almost start believing your own lies yeah isn't that true  yes then how easy and how do you know like you're not a pathological liar yeah wait a minute if you 
[02:28:00]  believe it maybe you're just lying all the time and people are calling you a liar we all could be a  pathological liar if you think you truly believe it oh shit is this the clip it's it's the whole  interview oh jesus how long is that 17 and a half minutes all right  we are the worst perfect uh let it roll 
[02:28:30]  i don't know well newt honesty okay but i mean he he's taking people to task he's uh  he doesn't give a fuck what people think of him i guess yeah you know what i really should say when  he was i don't know his record when he was speaker of the house he was constantly being like pounded by  the press and and uh right his uh the opposition and uh like he's been through it already so when  people jump on him about things he doesn't get flustered he doesn't have he he doesn't sit there 
[02:29:00]  not knowing how to deal with it right like he knows he just gets on and and addresses it right  uh he's a professional politician let's not let's not have any illusions oh yeah he's a  a grassroots guy you know he's the guy's a washington fucking mainstay he's no better than the  rest of him both sides by the way i'm a both sides guy right i think they're all full of shit  but i do think obama is uh ripe for the taking and um well you guys better get a candidate then man  i really think it's gonna be romney romney no i don't think people believe what romney's saying 
[02:29:30]  i think newt could take him really i really do wow because republicans are gonna vote for  the republican candidate sure and there's a lot of uh liberals independents and democrats that are  disillusioned with obama right uh whether they vote for nude or not is uh to be seen but if they  just sit out and if obama can't stir up that passion that he had four years ago to get uh uh people to 
[02:30:00]  vote for him right like he did he had people come out of the woodwork to have that first black president  and the hope and change thing that he had going if he can't muster those people again this time around  he's in trouble he's ripe for the taking and a lot of people are very disillusioned the angle i i want  to take here is uh have you ever seen a debate season like this where everyone's fucking up uh well  no no they i'm trying to remember like man that perry i'm trying to remember back to uh you know past  the debates and i don't remember you know you had the stockdale with uh who am i what am i doing here 
[02:30:30]  so you had your moments you had uh what's his name there um you're no fucking john oh that was a  perfect whatever stepped on a landmine on that with that one so there's been well there's been a few  but this this time around holy fuck they're all looking like idiots they're all looking like dummies  in the hot tub a lot of yeah michelle bachman what did she say about iran there's there's gonna be  yeah it's also everything is everywhere now so it's like you can't go find you have to get 
[02:31:00]  have your shit together for every interview because all you got to do like the herman cain  thing where he didn't know see anything in iran i didn't fucking get the answer from anyone it's  all about the timing she's like if i'm president there won't be an embassy in iran and people like 
[02:31:30]  uh we haven't had one since 1979 remember that little hostage thing right so she did that the rick  perry thing is rick perry said that uh when you're if you're 21 right uh vote for him on uh november 12th  oh that's the club you got that yeah here's rick and and it's all fun and games with this rick  perry but the fact is he's the governor of texas which is like a small country he's in charge he's  already in charge of a lot of shit you you you nailed it he's a good old boy that looks like he just 
[02:32:00]  drinks a little bourbon oh yeah he loves and stuff possibly and a little golf and if i may uh get into  a little uh seinfeld episode he does remind me of one of those guys it's like you tell those  bastards over there that son of a bitch in the uh houston astros yeah yeah from the houston astros  it's like the texans he's one of those guys i think well you bastards yeah he gets by by smiling 
[02:32:30]  and just having that kind of good old boy that personality you know what i mean he seems like  he's high right oh yeah he does hit that this is uh rick perry latest golf they call him golf  golf golf without the l yeah now that would be gaf yes speaking at a college in new hampshire  yesterday he didn't seem to know that the u.s voting age is 18. jesus you're just close to be  the president will be 21 by november the 12th i ask for your support and your vote those of you who 
[02:33:00]  won't be just work hard because you're gonna inherit this perry also got the election day wrong  it's november 6th not the 12th he almost does it george w there who work yeah i know yeah won't  you work hard it's unbelievable these guys are that close to being president there's only there's only  a handful of guys we're gonna pick from and they're all looking like dummies in the hot tub yeah  yeah but you know what he's in the top five of people who could be president right yeah and he 
[02:33:30]  doesn't know basic shit he doesn't know what the voting age is or what the election day is election  day bachman's big thing was for no embassy in iran like she went over the top with it like this is my  stance you should study things like when is election day when's the election age you have to  study that that's top of the head shit what's the succession of for the president uh think like  things that you might have to answer like simple things you should just you should study this and 
[02:34:00]  know it my problem with uh romney he looks like he's this close to a nervous breakdown all the time  yeah like a like a yorkshire terrier in a thunderstorm just all freaked out sitting in the bathtub he  he looks like he's it takes everything in his in his being to keep it together yeah and then at any  moment he's getting something that's gonna trigger a massive fucking nervous breakdown constantly has  his guard up yeah and the minute that he starts to bring it down and and speak like a person somebody 
[02:34:30]  next to him talks and he goes yeah yeah i think he he goes through life like he's just repeating over  and over in his head don't fuck this up don't fuck this up oh man and then herman cain oh you got  the detective ah look man i was i was all in gone look the guy was you know wasn't well i was saying  he wasn't sexually harassing women but he was absolutely you know making a move he's getting 
[02:35:00]  around and he's married and like and then he lies about it i mean come on let's be real well this is  how it went down last night let's be real he's saying that you flew around the country she's  saying that you were meeting in hotels can't we get plane tickets confirmation can't we get hotels  don't a lot of these hotels have videotapes that they some of them i would assume hang on to those  tapes forever uh and did this go ahead john do me a favor let's not play detective i am going to 
[02:35:30]  prove that i am going to re-establish my character okay we good luck good luck with that that's not  i'm no sherlock holmes that was the moment where he says yes let's find all that evidence to exonerate  right not no no yeah yeah yes i would love to see if those hotels and whatnot do have a videotape  right when this the new woman came out he's like well let's see what she has to say  before i talk in my own defense i wants to know what she says first right someone asked him like 
[02:36:00]  look another woman coming out you would say look once again i'm not cheating on my wife but he goes  well let's see what she has to say first i don't know even though they texted him from her phone right  and he called him back and it was the news that's classic that's sitting in a hot tub like a dummy  right there hello sorry i'm overusing that but it fucking makes me howl yeah baby what you want  the news he would have been better off uh going to sean hannity i didn't do shit i didn't do shit 
[02:36:30]  man i didn't do nothing yeah he's uh he's done ski but he's one of these guys that you know because  he's loving the limelight and he might be a pathological liar he's like i'm fucking hanging  in there man he should have stopped this whole thing like weeks ago i could just tell more lies  and i'll be fine and people will still put cameras in my face and i'll be popular and be able to get  more white women this am great i said he wanted to be president for the chicks yeah oh yeah i went 
[02:37:00]  into radio for the chicks yeah yeah he went into politics a little known fact you know like the  matrices i went into his business for the chicks at first yeah and then it became something like that's  what he's doing but he wants to be president for the chicks fuck the pizza pie i'm going into  meetings for the girls godfather pizza what's with godfather pizza too i've never had sort of a  stereotype thing well we're uh yeah he's not italian yeah he's not italian where did he uh where where

[02:38:00]  this comes up every time so let's let uh brandy have a little time all right here it comes go ahead  go ahead yeah i was just wondering when you're going to talk about ron paul because  everyone all the rest of them have something i think uh he looked more like a chick back about  10 years ago uh but but now that you've seen him without the makeup on no no i don't think what 
[02:38:30]  yes you're describing ru paul oh see see now i right now ron paul by the way is uh i like a lot of  ron paul's ideas but ron paul looks insane uh and looks have a lot to do with the presidency  and he doesn't unfortunately you know he has no personality yeah and i and i and i'm embarrassed  to say that's what it takes but it it is it's part of the whole fucking game you gotta have some 
[02:39:00]  charisma charisma some personality i don't think it should be that way but no the voters absolutely  vote if someone has a some personality i love his less government in your life shit and uh i love  his tax plan he's got great ideas but uh he's never gonna crack that fucking um that percentage  he needs to to really be a serious candidate oh can we get the help him out what how are we gonna  help the motherfucker out he's a frank pedu looking motherfucker motherfucker yeah but you 
[02:39:30]  have so much power anthony you can just just tell everyone to vote for him and they'll listen to  you uh no i i wish i had that kind of power if we had so we wouldn't be dealing with four years of  what we've been dealing with and if we had so much power we'd have a hell of a lot more twitter  followers oh yeah let's start with that exactly before you elect the president there's a whole gauge  of how much power you have now they don't have shit we'll just throw in a ron paul ron paul for  president there you go let's vote for ron paul there you go now watch you let's do this oh he's 
[02:40:00]  already up three uh percentage points no that's the problem in two seconds his number stays exactly  the same never budges doesn't move up it doesn't move down the same people that love him just like  stick with him no one else gets on board he can't get the new ones i don't know hey uh can we play  the rick perry commercial now remember it's an asshole what you're about to hear is the guy that is the  governor of texas yeah and he's still going with the whole fucking gaffe you had during the debate  this is his brand new commercial it just hit oh commerce education and the uh what's the third 
[02:40:30]  one there department of energy you know we've all lost our train of thought before but not many have  done it on national tv if you want a slick debater i'm obviously not your guy but if you want a clean  house in washington with a balanced budget amendment a flat tax and a part-time congress i'm your man  i'm rick perry what's that line again i'm rick and i approve of this message now can i start stick 
[02:41:00]  can i start yeah you would swear this is an snl bit right but he's dead serious this is his new  commercial that's a commercial this is how he's handling it and the problem is you have to be a  good debater if you're the president of the united states that's why they want you to debate to see  how you handle situations yeah because you're going to be talking to people and trying to sell them on  your point of view right so you really need to uh you really know how to fucking change someone's  opinion by debating them the great communicator yes right the great communicator right this would be 
[02:41:30]  like me sending out air checks of uh my john walsh introduction to other radio stations saying  i laugh it off but i can interview people like i just called john walsh walsh his dead  murt his murdered headless son's name right no problem uh what's that guy's name again  this is getting crazy man it's insane it's really fucking weird this time around people are saying 
[02:42:00]  that we've always had this i just don't remember it like yeah a debate season that is just all over  the place well all right all right dukakis was a pretty big douchebag i'm sure he was a weenie and he  was this close to being the president with his he was close that tank helmet and his big bobble head  out of the tank remember that that fucked him up that was the jumping there it is there's his dumb  head in the tank he was doing really really well up to that point he looked like a bobble head doll  he looked ridiculous classic and then kitty dukakis we used to do a lot of bits on her yeah she loved 
[02:42:30]  her drink drink would be one thing she was spraying hairspray in her mouth and all right  drinking fucking lysol yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh you can't admit you're not a good debater  no that's really important that's in the job description i think i might not be a good debater  but well then you'd be a terrible president uh but if you want a debater to what so when he goes  if he's a president yeah is he saying that when he goes in to meet with world leaders yeah he'll have 
[02:43:00]  the best interest of our country at heart but he just won't be able to tell the person that so we  might not get everything we want he's gonna say a lot oh that's a good point all right yeah yeah  he sold me on some things yeah holy shit mr president what happened when you met with the  russian leader apparently i gave away uh 13 states godfather's pizzas in hess gas stations yeah 
[02:43:30]  they got a bunch in new jersey not in new york you eat that shit when you're desperate oh hell yeah  yeah you you uh if you want pizza you don't go to godfather's pizza they make you an offer you can't  refuse yeah look at the guys in the pinstripe suit with the fedora on what's your favorite pizza  what's your favorite pizza my favorite pizza is probably vincent's pizza in roslin yes vincent's

[02:45:00]  of your pizza so the box doesn't know it always works no my uh doesn't ever my go-to food was when i  was what was pizza hut uh spaghetti pizza hut and i wouldn't get the pizza i would get the spaghetti  with a watery sauce i fucking love you sop it up with the bread i don't know if it's good that is  good stuff you know what that watery sauce on the bread i had that for lunch fucking three four days a  week easy i remember in california going to the straw hat pizza palace and playing video games was 
[02:45:30]  the new thing called video games yeah yeah no the pizza sucked really but they had like games that  were really fucking kind of cool for the time i'll tell you the best pizza on long island yeah easily  it's a place we call herwin uh pizza because it's one of those things you just got to keep eating it  centiport it's in huntington oh across from the old uh fast eddies oh right that place is great  right on the corner it's just slices slices all day long those big slices of the place but but they

[02:46:30]  top to finish off the slice yeah crazy and between the cold cheese and the hot cheese it's it's perfect  does the cold cheese like melt a little bit better it starts melting right away because the slice itself  is piping hot all right then that's good as long as it's melted i forgot the name of the place right  across from the old fast eddies uh on you know new york avenue which is uh the same street as uh  fh riley's what are you trying to get my free slice my brother's restaurant oh how do you pick  how do you pick it was oh vincent best pizza's vincent's and huntington right across the street

[02:52:00]  fuck man between the wings and the stupid fish fry battered dip shit it's all fat chicks crazy  yeah yeah yeah well we nicknamed them years ago buffalo bettys yeah yeah of course they would wear  their over oversized uh buffalo bills sweatshirts so you couldn't even tell if they had nice tits  no just huge it just it was just like it just made them all look like snowmen  god they wear that loose fitting top to try to hide it but it was a lot of sweatshirts and a lot 
[02:52:30]  they a lot of pants a lot of the girls in buffalo dress like dudes that's almost like they had  they just shared clothes with their husbands or boyfriends i'm serious that was the look they  were going for whether like especially when bar to look for for girls were there were there hot  chicks to well uh from uh graded on a curve honestly from about october 15th to almost may  you couldn't tell you couldn't tell they had their winter gear on man now there were some hot girls 
[02:53:00]  up there go to the park bench i just went local i don't even know the park bench that was uh that was  uh and the brick bar the brick bar brick brick brick something ow ow she's up oh you know what  mighty mighty i just sounded really cocky park bench is stony brook i'm mixing up i'm mixing up my radio  career and where i used to hang out did they do thursday it was uh the brick bar i think what 
[02:53:30]  thursdays in the square when they'd have like local bands just play out in the street it was like the  the one month out of the year it was warm up there uh what downtown yeah downtown they did it  when i was there vacation mecca when i when i was down when i was uh in buffalo downtown was uh  zombie heaven downtown it was you you didn't get caught in downtown buffalo when the sun went down  really it's a scary fucking place you can go right downtown brickyard oh boy no brick bar and then a 
[02:54:00]  place that i'll get killed for saying this but uh uh the pink flamingo no the pink the nudie bar  no what the fuck nudie but how old are you i forgot the name of booby bar it might have been called the  pink flamingo but it was a cool like kind of punk type uh like edgy place no it was definitely a strip  club by that time by the time oh really yeah i think it had the same name though if i remember 
[02:54:30]  correctly i mean it was 10 years ago yeah uh kevin what's going on guys kevin hart man  this is a nice surprise how are you brother i'm good i'm good i'm good you hanging in there  yeah man you know because times could be a little better yeah no shit huh due to the circumstances but  uh i can't i can't complain yeah i uh this one just we've been saying it all week this one just  fucking hurts if people don't know uh kevin hart knew patrice o'neal real well yeah this this was a 
[02:55:00]  uh you know what i can't even i don't i don't like to be that be down dude but uh this one this  one hit me a little hard you know uh it definitely you know we can't say that it was a shocker because  we knew he was in the hospital we knew that we weren't great but you know reality doesn't hit you  until until you you're really really smacked in the face with it you know in our mind it's like  i always in the hospital but he'll be all right big dummy it'll be good you know right it's not  that serious or you know it's a matter of time before he's out back to himself and uh you know 
[02:55:30]  after a while you just didn't hear nothing you didn't hear any news you didn't hear any good news  or bad news so the way that i'm thinking is no news is good news and then literally monday you know  smack with the whole wow patrice uh he passed away and dude i honestly i i just sat down  and and canceled my day i didn't do anything i talked to keith for a while and in reality hit me 
[02:56:00]  a little later you know you as a man you don't like prime as a man you don't like it but uh it's  weird when it actually comes out because you realize the one that you're closest to doing that  i lost a good one yeah really lost a close friend so yeah it was a low blow yeah it's okay i still  haven't been able to wrap my mind around this at all i've just been walking through the last month  just numb it kind of sucked that we couldn't give anyone updates because we sort of knew right from  the beginning that this stroke was a motherfucker and people were all trying to stay positive we all 
[02:56:30]  just knew what the outcome was going to be unfortunately you never know you always hear  those stories where it's like wow you know it was supposedly really bad but then you know something  happened people you know will bring up the word miracle right and and you always hope for that  absolutely um but uh in this case uh that never happened and uh yeah it's it's such a fucking  bummer because uh he was just a you know and and colin said one of a kind you know uh there's there's no 
[02:57:00]  one even close to being like him you know he's he's irreplaceable um in that way yeah that's funny  because that's what i say when when reality hits yeah you you realize exactly what a person was  worth with what their force was right and what they meant to the business and you know when it comes  to stand-up comedy man you the one thing that comedians attempt to do is pride themselves on 
[02:57:30]  originality you know everybody attempts to be different they attempt to be clever they attempt to  be witty you know or smart or groundbreaking and people really don't understand how how  groundbreaking patrice was you know from from dealing with the business from not wanting to be  the guy that was hollywood from refusing to let agents and managers dictate his career 
[02:58:00]  to to not being afraid to tell people to shut their mouth like if they were out of line like  the man definitely was uh he he was on a different plateau man and you know i think now people are  honestly going to understand what that man's worth was to comedy you know after going back and looking  at his body at work so it's sad that we got to miss it miss him this way for people to realize it but  you know i i think now people will understand the talent that patrice on their way i said it earlier  he's going to be massively huge in death unfortunately when they they should have realized when he was alive and 
[02:58:30]  he was about to hit on his own terms he was right there finally on his own terms he was going to  make it the way he wanted to and that hurts too you know because we all know that he he definitely  wanted that very true dude very very true yeah now you guys are going to witness me try not to cry  and if i do cry and you repeat it i swear to god i'm a punchbow yeah i mean i've seen a lot of tough 
[02:59:00]  guys uh cried in the last week yeah it's just been it's been so so tough because uh yeah he's just  so fucking original and different yet you take it for granted when when he's when he was in here  doing the show you took for granted everything from his his big dumb booming laugh to you know his  take on relationships and shit like that and then when you realize that you never you're never going  to get that anymore it becomes really really sad you know and he was he was he was never not funny 
[02:59:30]  yep never i mean whether the mics were on the mics were off or we were just hanging out in the street  or just taking an elevator ride he made interesting everything he was always on you'll be on you guys  beyond true yeah beyond it man beyond the dude well you know uh like i said i don't like to be the  debbie downer you know i believe that uh when when things uh like this happen you have to find a  positive uh as some some place right so you know my positive is simply i'm honestly happy and blessed to 
[03:00:00]  say that i was a friend of this man yeah you know with this loss i'm i'm trying to deal with the best  as i can but you know let's take the time to celebrate that man's life and what he's done  oh yeah you are patrice o'neill fan out there and if you you know if you were affected by it at all  just go back and understand if he really was here patrice is the type of dude that'll tell you to shut 
[03:00:30]  up and stop crying get over it you know what i mean i i knowing that well to where i know that that  will come out man so you know i can't do nothing but express my love my condolences to his family  and friends yeah you know i'm i'm gonna do what i'm supposed to and be there as a friend  and support those others you know the other guys that are there uh and as comedians you know it's  it's it's it's funny because things like this will bring us all closer together so you know we're  going to pull together and do what we can for for his family you know outside of uh the funeral just 
[03:01:00]  to make sure they're okay because like i said we we lost we lost a close one so for us it's making  sure that he's okay all around right now right yeah that's for sure man kevin thanks so much man  no problem guys uh i'll see you later i'll come in and uh it'll be on a on a different time yeah  absolutely we look forward to that kevin no problem guys thank you man kevin hart everyone  bye bye yeah it's such a bummer oh i can't wait till this is all just like you know 
[03:01:30]  behind us it's such a bummer it's uh you're having fun and then you're all sudden bummed out  it's that uh proverbial uh emotional roller coaster yeah it's it's all going down on monday like i can't  wait for tuesday because then it becomes what it what it is yeah and then you just got a deal and  that's obviously going to suck too but at least on as they say at least you're at that point yeah  yeah and then you could kind of almost focus and celebrate his life and fucker almost start you 
[03:02:00]  know kind of smiling yeah yeah you know i mean obviously we try to have a good time and have some  fun and everything and and we do it's not a an act but it's just it's always there you know under the  surface and then and then you get a situation where it pops its head up and you realize oh fuck  and then you got to get back to you know pussy and dick jokes and fish fry assholes and fish frying  someone's saying it's because they're all catholic weenies and heinies and yeah pps pps talking about 
[03:02:30]  your cum heinies yellow cum someone said is it yeah maybe anthony's cumming beer right fuck you you  might want to throw uh water in there every once in a while no it happens when it yeah i might want to  drink some fucking water uh yeah to fucking dull it up a little bit water but hey turn that beer's  made with water right there's water in it yeah there's water in it um if you if you get if you 
[03:03:00]  build up a load but don't shoot it and then wait for a while it's going to get a little gacky  it's going to be a little different when you finally do blow the load i think that's how you get a  dummy too really it's dumb old yellow cum yellow cum is idiot juice all right it's yellow cum right  yeah that's how you make morons you gotta you gotta keep that sperm fresh all the time just in case 
[03:03:30]  keep jerking it that's such a dick thing to say people go through hell with that oh boy uh listen  alan uh new york has something on the fish fry what do you got al  hey listen guys it's because i grew up in rochester and they do the same crap it's because  of lent they're not supposed to eat meat on fridays oh it's because they enjoy fucking fried food it's  actually a religious thing well yeah i think that's stupid growing up as one of the only jews up there 
[03:04:00]  i would sit around my shrug my shoulders all the time well i was lucky enough to live in boston as well  boston has a lot of those catholics why aren't they doing the fish fry friday catholic i don't know  i was in boston with you guys too and i don't know no you weren't i never met you i never saw him  opie indeed i listen to you guys all the time when i was in college i don't believe you how old are you  now oh boy 35 oh that's great that's great child of the 80s yeah child of the 80s all right thanks 
[03:04:30]  all right yeah you punch out 35 jesus christ i didn't know kevin hart was calm fuck yeah patrice  had on people yeah yep absolutely should we go um to break with some a moment of silence  i like when other shows do that it's very dramatic now be the best part of the show and then  and then a commercial comes on for dick cream oh a fucking ball fucking freshener right xxxx 
[03:05:00]  xxxx me look out no moment of silence that's such fucking hack shit when they do it on tv  it's just dead air on the radio it doesn't even yeah you can't see anything people just tuning in  and like where'd they go next station somewhere else fuck this i can't wait the 0.001 second  uh we get we uh go to break yes we do i almost slipped and said home no we're not going home  we've got more show after this you know since he said it no there's more show after this we're 
[03:05:30]  going to go to break i i think the time would be well spent remembering patrice o'neill i think so  patrice would want us patrice would want us to go home early and start our weekends we've moved past  this to the point where now we're just using the tragedy to our own to our own benefit  you could look at it that way sam and i'm sure you'll get angry tweets for looking at it like  that i will yes but we're not looking at that no i already got by the way one angry tweet from a  person who thinks i should be killed because i compared bobo to carlin apparently uh wait a 
[03:06:00]  minute weren't you joking yeah people are adults he's just understand that much just understand  that nobody would seriously when we're using sarcastle carlin to bobo i know sarcasm's hard  when you write it but when you hear someone using sarcasm it's pretty obvious most could usually  tell the speed skating guy is going to drive me nuts all day yeah but bruce jenner won the  decathlon well he did open there are people who just sit by their radios waiting to either 
[03:06:30]  criticize or correct something and that's the only reason they listen maybe they're insane  they're crazy people there's a there's got to be a percentage of the audience that is legitimately  completely insane lunatics and i think it's a larger than most other shows i think so too i got one  yeah i don't know if i i gotta find find this person she tweets me stuff oh i know i know it's  language i know it's english oh really i see the words they're english words but how she puts them  together yeah holy mother of jesus unconventional it's unbelievable because sometimes you can figure

[04:06:00]  all the interns were all arguing with each other sal was upset with matt and the ron and fez interns  were making fun of well matt and he's just not a popular guy we brought up because today um  we did uh we did dueling idiots i guess is what it will be called the battle of the dummies this is  steve sterniolo from raw dog who was just around the hallways hanging out and i told him he could 
[04:06:30]  come in here because why not it's friday you know yeah what do you got it's a looser day on the  after show i feel like he texted me every day is a loose day it's never been a tight day uh he  texted me while the bobo versus jordan segment was happening saying it was the best radio he'd ever  heard i i i it was amazing just because it was a it was a battle of two complete dummies and by the  way um for those of you uh keeping score at home you know we had uh bobo on the air at the end of the 
[04:07:00]  show once he got to the dmv he was on uh what happened was uh what's it what's the other guy's  name jordan jordan jordan was on hold for the entire hour and a half what he's after that bit  after his bit and then we went to break and everything was done jordan was on hold for the  rest of the show i love that now i don't know if he hung up or he was or the phone lines were cleared  um no he he must have hung up he did hang up okay because nobody would ever hang up on jordan  people people think it's an honor not to be hung up on but there are also those who don't realize 
[04:07:30]  that the reason we don't hang up on you is because we want to see how long you're willing to stay on  hold and uh jordan my favorite part was just listening to jordan um think matt just gave paul a look  oh dude because did you see did you see your computer screen oh i see he was like petting the box of  flowers and stuff you don't have to leave matt but don't say anything yet um what was going on 
[04:08:00]  was that jordan thought that like it he was part of the show and it was anthony and opie and jordan  and everybody just kind of making fun of bobo i i that's what that's what he thought he was part of  the crew right you know and like jim was out so you were much more vocal than you know you you  talk but you're much more vocal today without jim so he thought hey it's me opie anthony and sam  we're just hanging out bashing on a bobo making fun of this dumb bo look at nobody likes bobo am i  right not realizing it was uh it was like dinner for schmucks where we just sit around and watch 
[04:08:30]  idiots be idiots uh and then i couldn't help but notice matt the intern was in the phone screening  room which is just separated by a pane of glass between us or a couple it's soundproof let's put  it that way but uh we can i can see what's going on in there and matt's just laughing along uh not to  say he shouldn't have been laughing but he had the same expression on his face where he was in  the jordan camp of you do know that you kind of fall under that dummy umbrella too i i wouldn't say 
[04:09:00]  that i think i think that every appearance you've had and i like you very much i know yeah but i'm  your favorite answer even though yesterday i caught him he was making flyers actually on the sirius xm  computers he created a new sport and he was handing them out i guess what on campus or something uh it's  called he was creating flyers called ice lacrosse yeah ice lacrosse lacrosse why are we doing that  here well because i don't have a a printer at home well sam i know you needed something edited  yesterday but how is he supposed to launch his brand new sport yeah well i'm on my way back  downstairs oh he called you a liar why didn't he call him a liar what did he call him he made fun he 
[04:09:30]  made fun of wow he really called you a liar before tell fucking roland the truth during the  wait wait during the commercial break you said roland's uh uh what did he say he's a liar sam  said that roland's a liar and no seat's turning old said first roland's no never actually literally  yes never said that no i didn't either thank you thank you believe me i said i said you did say  shut up shut up i said to matt i said matt you think roland's a liar he goes yeah yeah and he goes  yeah yeah dire the wimpy kid told me this yeah exactly dumb hair he called you an obese liar 
[04:10:00]  now he said no see that's not true i don't know that that's very exactly i don't know that just  likes to talk shit you better go before you better go give that stuff opie left his ipad and camera  here god punished him enough by crazy god punished him enough matt you're pissed that paul wrote on  a note to me saying matt has no business in here no i didn't know that actually you why were you  giving him a dirty look why were you giving him a dirty look i wasn't actually why don't you do it 
[04:10:30]  get it all right you're out you go back and touch the pro flower box because that's what you were  literally doing in here i was i was coming in uh wondering what to touch it but here's the thing  steve cerniello and this is why you have to be careful because matt's not like matt paul's fine  because yeah he's he's dealing with matt here like if paul if i were in here just kind of lingering  he wouldn't say shit no no and paul wrote but no no i'm not saying you should but i'm saying if i  were in matt's position as an intern and paul wrote sam has no business being in here then when i got 
[04:11:00]  confronted on that i would say well what's paul's business in here but paul guess what you don't  have to answer that question because he didn't ask you yeah so so sit comfortably no i'm fine and  matt you are dismissed okay you're not kicked out but you're dismissed okay i'll talk to you later  why don't you work on your flyers for your new sport  you're brand new players what's what's this word you're creating  yep see i turned it off 
[04:11:30]  oh is that how you do it you press buttons on it yeah i got buttons you just move mics i know you're  not um steve you host uh some stuff on raw dog you're on the air with funny in the morning  yes which must be just a joy for you it's a great morning every morning when it's funny when you get a  little funny in your morning that's my it's my wait so it's a joy when it's funny meaning it's  very funny every morning rarely enjoy um sure that's on raw dog and i mean nobody's gonna listen  to it because they listen to yeah the phone show the phone show is my other jobs we talk about the 
[04:12:00]  phone show because dom in buffalo is feedbacking in joe de rosa says he is hosting a call-in show on  the virus at 1 p.m is this true joe de rosa tweeted incorrectly because he's hosting a call-in show  with me at 1 p.m on raw dog raw dog that's it sounds like uh your booker roland who was very  kind enough to help me just reach out to a few comedians because he's got a lot of contacts and  he pitched the show and uh it sounds like uh maybe he was a little confused but it's raw dog  serious xm channel 99 correct they get to be on the same channel on both platforms most channels do 
[04:12:30]  not us yeah it's completely normal yeah jim florentine the other day when he was in here said  hey uh uh i i would you did you text me about doing something for you guys on this december 12th  yeah and i go no i didn't and then i found out another one who thought it was a virus thing it was  the phone show well whatever we got to do to lure them up here it's like we we trick we get our  listeners to come subscribe but then it's our job to keep them here it's my job to keep jim florentine  here when we lure him in now you're doing uh 12 days of this phone show right day one was yesterday 
[04:13:00]  and amy schumer and jason ellis came in and the calls were fucking atrocious and you get uh well  don't i mean they were but i feel like you take you should take some responsibility if the show  doesn't work the whole it's the house well but what happened but if it's all callers calling in  and literally it's all caller driven all right so what are you doing there i literally say jason  ellis and amy schumer you're on with alan but i do nothing uh jason ellis and amy schumer were the  guests yesterday well they were the you know i was just i'm just play traffic cop pal i'm fine with  don't fucking dom and buffalo you're on with amy and jason enjoy no because you also try to you 
[04:13:30]  you try to get a little witty okay me no yes you do yes you do try to get a little witty talk to me  you try to be a little entertaining i just i tend to disagree all right um jason amy schumer is not  gonna laugh at anything i say no that's right uh amy schumer and jason ellis were in i was listening  to a little bit and then i saw amy as she was leaving and uh i said amy how'd the phone show go  she said suck the dick is what she said which i believe uh she's uh being truthful what well it 
[04:14:00]  it was it was a i thought yesterday was a train wreck but a good train wreck and somebody won a  grand which is all that matters this is all that matters this is what we need to talk about because  people were tweeting me about this okay oh i'm not saying don't listen to the phone show i'm not  terribly confident that most of you will but i'm not saying don't yeah because why would you want to  win to the phone why would you want to win money for here's the thing you don't have to listen to  the phone show to win money you gotta call in yeah of course of course i'm not telling you to  listen call in that's all i want the phone show makes no sense inherently there's there's 
[04:14:30]  there is no reason for a person to listen to the phone show because why would i listen to other  people try to win money why do people watch american idol because people are singing right  they're doing something people are doing something whether you like it or not people sit  around no no no and they'll be like oh you know what that guy sucked i hope he doesn't win any  money people whether you want to admit it or not you're in your own little world i get it it's  whether you want to admit it or not it's just random people calling in it's not people with 
[04:15:00]  a specific talent it could be bobo calling it 12 times all i'm saying is it's people call in and get  to do what they want that's just the premise of the show whether you like it whether you hate it  whether nobody's listening i don't care if you listen just call in why would anyone listen to this  show not call i understand why people would call to win am i here to tell people to listen i'm here  telling people to call in and win money so what's the point of having the show on the air because  we have to put them on the air so they can try to win money what what other medium do you want  us to have them on to call in well i was thinking there are probably better resources for the money 
[04:15:30]  than to oh well that's you got to go talk to the ceo and all them in the company i just you want  to talk to them let's call i don't think that they would like that very much no all right well  that's who you got to take that up with um but even you steve sternie alone would you host this  show if they asked you to would you do it yeah okay so so i'm not my answers are your answers  uh what are you getting defensive for i'm asking you about the show defensive now you think i'm  attacking you as a host no i feel like i feel like you're trying to the the show is simple and it's a 
[04:16:00]  theory is it the greatest show i don't know no no it's not you call in you try to win the show  doesn't make any sense it's not a good show but it's a good service yeah they get to win money  now it's a good service to people outside the company there's some of us here oh so you're  oh so that's your complaint you're saying you're so what you're overlying thing is is not so much  the phone show and people calling in i don't care no no it's where the money's getting directed to  it's it's a it's beautiful if if listeners win money i like the listeners okay apparently you don't 
[04:16:30]  i don't have a problem with them winning money the problem would be when i'm getting uh tweets  saying hey sam i heard what what's the what's the what's the day of the big finale because i  know usually december 16th we're going to be giving away 25 000 leading up to that are you  are you still doing it every thursday and no it's going to be 12 weekdays in a row it started  yesterday okay and every day we give away a grand for 10 days and then those 10 people compete we'll  cut it down to five and on the last day which is december 16th one of those five people win 
[04:17:00]  25 000 and it's at 1 p.m eastern on raw dog 1 p.m east on raw dog and sam i i i think you know what  you need a raise now i'm endorsing you what now you know from raw dog you know now you're kissing  his ass the thing you were a ton an hour ago paul get out of here yeah i don't know what he's  trying to jump in he's talking 20 minutes ago a minute ago you were kissing my ass but when he  said no you're kissing his ass he was kissing my ass i enjoy sam roberts on the radio i was i sam  would admit that i helped to get him on raw dog steve and i lost what a talent he is work together 
[04:17:30]  all the time we do we we steve and i are on beautiful paul gave me the mouth closed nod like  okay you got it just protected my boy yeah just making sure i didn't need any back no i want  i want one of the listeners of this channel to win 25 000 so tell them to call in what's the phone  number eight seven no one's gonna remember the phone it's on at 1 p.m on raw dog every day  until december 16th and the last day it'll be 25 000 how do i rationalize the fact  they've allocated what's the final fee it's a thousand dollars a day and then 25 right so how 
[04:18:00]  much is it all mathematically all together i guess if i did 12 days of phone show 11 30 it'd be 35  grand because we're going to weigh 10 1 000 and then a 25 000 so 35 000 how how do i sit sit there and  and and and and rationalize that this is what's going on how much do you make here  one night i have been specifically told not to bring that up do you fill out a time sheet 
[04:18:30]  no no i'm hourly i'm a full-time employee well so i'd say you probably make what 80 90 a year  it's below that number i think i'm okay to say that but above 10 a year it's a full-time employee  all i'm asking what does paul make i make uh i'm not in this discussion at all oh i got a hotline  call it's important hotline hi is this money bag get out of here rolling you son of a bitch  like oh god who's calling in you know what i do for the company i know you try to get people to call
