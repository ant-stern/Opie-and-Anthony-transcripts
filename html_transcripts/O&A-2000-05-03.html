<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with the promotion of "Whip'em Out Wednesday," encouraging women to flash their breasts at cars displaying "Wow" stickers obtainable from Ranch 1 locations or by theft.  The hosts rated the day's "boob sighting index" as a seven.  They also heavily promoted a skywriting stunt by pilot Paul, who was writing "Mom" (with the implication that it could also be read as "Wow" depending on the angle) over Central Park for Mother's Day. This was presented as the next step in the show's "Air Force," following land and sea-based promotions, with humorous speculation about acquiring a submarine.  Leslie Gould, the show's "radio chick," was featured in a news segment and was the subject of a "most popular radio diva" online poll, with the hosts urging listeners to vote for her and accusing other stations of ballot stuffing.

The broadcast extensively documented the struggles of Earl, the employee distributing "Wow" stickers, with audio clips of his navigational difficulties and complaints. Psycho Mark was mentioned as Earl's companion on this task. Listener emails were discussed, including one detailing a successful attack on the "Indian Link" online message board, an "enemy of the show," and another about the appropriate level of breast exposure during "Wow" interactions. Commercials for Stacker 2 and Diamond Vision were aired throughout.  The show also previewed upcoming guests Louis Black and "Spaz," and a planned "hot wax" segment.

The show continued with a sexually explicit fantasy involving Louie Anderson, followed by a discussion of Earl and Psycho Mark's absence from their sticker distribution duties at Ranch 1. A listener, Steve, reported "Wowing" a car in the Holland Tunnel.  The skywriting stunt was again discussed.  A significant portion was dedicated to listener calls about "film flubs," with examples from *American Pie*, *Jagged Edge*, *U-571*, *The Wedding Singer*, *Fight Club*, *The Godfather*, *Pulp Fiction*, and *Private Parts*.

The "Broad Bingo" game, where female listeners called in with their bra sizes, was a major segment.  Shannon, a previous contest winner, was a guest in the studio, leading to discussion about her appearance and the contest.  This was interspersed with promotion for Anthony's limo service, Vital Transportation, resulting in a chaotic exchange where the phone number was repeatedly given.  A planned "Spaz Cam" segment, featuring Spaz in a Boy Scout uniform to be insulted by listeners for $5, was also promoted.  The segment included promotion for Rockaway Bedding and continued discussion of "Broad Bingo," punctuated by comedic banter between the hosts and Shannon.  The episode concluded with the promise of hot wax being dripped on Shannon and a commercial for MindSpring Internet Services.

Further segments included more "Bra Bingo," with sexually suggestive commentary about the callers' breasts, and continued updates on the skywriting, with listeners reporting sightings and embellishments like added nipples to the letters.  The in-studio hot wax dripping on Shannon was broadcast via "spaz cam."

A major portion of the show focused on a rapidly escalating conflict with a staff member named Rick, stemming from pictures of vandalized personal property (including a fish and a porcelain horse head, referencing prior segments) anonymously posted on foundrymusic.com.  Rick's furious reaction, including leaving the studio and making angry phone calls, dominated the segment.  Opie and Anthony vehemently denied involvement, despite Rick's accusations.  The segment ended with Rick remaining absent and the hosts discussing the damaged studio bathroom, with Anthony recovering a ripped-off toilet door.

Finally, the show ended with a heated argument between Opie and Rick, concerning a prank aired on the show involving the photos.  Opie claimed he'd asked Rick not to bring it up, due to privacy concerns regarding Linda and others involved. Rick argued he'd only understood the request as applying to an assumed random listener's prank, not the one that was ultimately revealed. The argument escalated into a shouting match, with Rick ultimately "dumping out" of the show. Opie repeatedly stressed his lack of prior knowledge and involvement in the prank.  The discussion also briefly touched upon another prank where someone was punched. The show concluded with the usual closing banter, mentioning upcoming guests Don and Mike, and some unrelated final comments.  Shannon's brief presence was also mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I feel stupid, oh so stupid, I feel stupid and dumb and dumb.  Opie and Ed, we've got a smile on our face and our head up our ass.  Whatever you said, WNEW.  Hey, mother effers, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday, baby. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Who the hell has Wow on their car, huh?  Come on, I know one guy that does.  I'm driving in, some guy towing a car.  The marshals were out there and everything and they were towing somebody's car.  And I'm waiting at a light and the guy goes, hey, I got my Wow sticker.  Pointing at it, I'm like, yeah, any luck?  He goes, I just got it on.  I said, beautiful day for it.  Good luck to you.  The boob sighting index today is at a, let me take a look, Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, it's nice out there.  I would give it actually a seven, though.  Seven early in the season?  Early in the season.  It could be warmer.  It's very nice.  But a boob sighting index is at a seven.  A lot of new listeners have no clue what Whip'em Out Wednesday is about.  It's so freaking easy, okay?  Here's the deal.  You put a Wow on your car. 
[00:01:30]  You can get one of these fine Wow stickers that we have all over the tri-state area.  Right.  Go to the Ranch 1 locations.  The participating Ranch 1 locations have the Wow sticker.  You can send in a self-addressed stamped envelope for the Wow sticker.  Just put Wow on the envelope, WNEW, 888 7th Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10106.  Make sure it's a self-addressed stamped envelope.  We send you a Wow sticker, okay?  Or the easiest way to get one, just peel it off of someone's car that already has one.  And I hope you guys are still getting creative out there. 
[00:02:00]  Even though we've made it real easy this season with the brand new Wow sticker that everyone is proud of.  We really like when you guys make your homemade signs and stuff.  Yeah, and I think those might even get a better result.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like if you really have a big Wow sign on your car that you made yourself, colorful, whatever.  I think a lady passing by would see that and go, oh, now there's somebody who didn't just slap the sticker on there  and might not be into it or something.  Right.  Somebody who's really into it.  Right. 
[00:02:30]  So I'm going to Wow them.  It's early in the season, so we're going to spend a lot of time on Whippin' Mount Wednesday today, without a doubt.  Ladies, you see the Wow, if you feel like it, you don't have to, no one's forcing you or anything, you could show your lovely boobage.  We also like talking some of the ladies through this, especially early in the season.  Yeah.  If you're a first time at Wowing, you see somebody with a sticker or a Wow, give us a call from your car and we'll talk you through the whole Wowing process.  Correct.  And if you're a fan of the Opie and Anthony show, we do not want any lady harassed on the highways and the byways. 
[00:03:00]  There are plenty of women that will do this.  No problem.  No problem.  Look, wave, smile, and move along.  Yeah.  I mean, there are ladies right now driving around looking for Wow stickers.  I was reading a ton of email before the show.  They are out there.  Guys, it is very, very important.  Do not harass the ladies.  Do not follow them.  Just put the Wow on your car, mind your own business, and hopefully you'll see something, okay? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  You guys will wreck it for us.  I'm telling you, if you're a fan of this show, do not harass the women.  We have a great bunch of listeners, though.  Like when we do the live shows, all the bouncers always say there's never a problem or anything, so I don't think we're going to have any problems like that.  All right.  But I just want to stress that.  Yeah.  Because it's really important.  Because there are a ton of ladies that want to do this, and they will do it.  And you'll be calling us and saying, oh, my God, I didn't think this worked, but it does work.  It works, man.  You just get the Wow on your car.  All right. 
[00:04:00]  And we're doing another Wow sticker stop today, Anthony.  Oh, who's driving?  Black Earl.  Oh, my God.  No.  Black Earl will be at the Ranch 1 location, Anthony.  There's a lot of them, but he'll be at the one on 14 East 42nd Street.  Okay.  It's in Manhattan, then.  It's in Manhattan.  It's only 15 minutes from the station.  Well, that's with a normal human being driving?  Yeah.  Well, we told Earl to leave now.  He's going to leave in the near future, so he gets there in time.  I sure hope so. 
[00:04:30]  Because we don't want to hear Earl in the van like we did yesterday.  This is actual audio of Earl getting lost going to Fidelity Diamond.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Yeah, he was kind of crying yesterday.  He got lost.  Yeah.  It took a long time.  Yeah.  But everybody got their stickers that were there, and they were very happy.  Huge crowd yesterday.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Thank you.  Thank you for the support, okay? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  But Ranch 1, 42nd Street and 5th Avenue.  I guess it's right there on the corner or pretty close.  Pretty close.  If you get to 42nd and 5th Avenue, you'll see with the Wow van, you'll see the crowd.  And Earl will be there at 4 o'clock.  Maybe we'll send Psycho Mark down there.  I mean, these things are turning into little parties, right, Anthony?  Hell yeah.  Little mini road shows.  Yeah.  So 4 o'clock, Ranch 1, 42nd Street and 5th Avenue.  We'll be there with the brand new Wow stickers, okay?  Yep.  We've got to talk to Paul real fast.  I guess there's a pilot writing Wow in the sky. 
[00:05:30]  Paul.  Yo.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Real good.  Good.  We're all set for today.  You're the pilot?  Yeah.  And you're allowed to write Wow in the sky?  I'm allowed to write Mom.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I've got permission today from the FAA and all the approach and departure controls.  We're all set to go.  All right.  So how are we going to handle this?  Well, I'm going to leave Sussex Airport at about quarter to five.  And sometime between 5 and 5.15, I'll start writing it. 
[00:06:00]  And where will you be writing this fine mom sign?  It's going to be over Central Park.  And with the way the wind is today, it should float over the river.  So you should be able to see it from all over New York.  Paul.  All right.  We want a bunch of pictures of that.  Yeah.  Paul, if you do this, we're going to bow to you today.  And if anyone can get pictures of this, please send them into the radio show.  Can you call us from the plane or anything?  You got a phone?  No, it wouldn't work.  I don't think it would.  The problem with the phone is at the air is it usually picks up the furthest tower away 
[00:06:30]  and you wind up paying.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, how about you call us just before you take off or something?  Oh, yeah.  I could do that.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  We're going to give you a special number.  We've got to get you right through to the radio show.  Okay.  All right.  There's Paul the pilot, everyone.  He's going to be writing Mom in the Sky today, Anthony.  Mom.  It's going to be a big mom sign over Central Park for the upcoming Mother's Day, Opie.  Of course.  It's Mom.  It has nothing to do with Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Hey, Paul, if you make this happen today, you could have the run of the place. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  You come in here.  We want to meet you and everything.  It's going to happen.  It's a done deal.  You will officially be a hanger-on.  Cool.  You'll be able to show up whenever you want.  Cool.  You'll be whisked right into the studio.  Hey, what altitude do you do that at?  10,000.  10,000.  10,000 feet.  That rocks, man.  All right.  Hold on, Paul.  Okay, guys.  All right.  There he goes, Paul.  He's going to be writing Mom in the Sky today, Anthony.  A big wow of the Central Park.  Oh, my God.  That's going to rock. 
[00:07:30]  If he pulls this one off, I'll be amazed.  I'll be absolutely amazed.  You know what's great?  The Opie and Anthony Show, we've always had our army.  We've been building our army.  He hung up.  Paul, we need to talk to you.  You sure?  Okay.  We've been building our army up.  Yeah.  You know, whenever there's an enemy of the show or something that we need done, our listeners  are rabid.  Yes.  We love it.  Yes.  And now we're beginning our Air Force.  That's right.  We've got the Air Force.  We're building an Air Force now.  We actually have aircraft involved in this program. 
[00:08:00]  This goddamn radio show is a virus at this point.  I'm waiting for...  We have syndication underground.  There are hundreds upon hundreds of people, maybe thousands at this point, listening to  us all over the country.  Infiltration, man.  I love it.  The lawyers are like, they're shutting down websites, and the next day they pop up somewhere  else.  It's just getting absolutely nuts, this radio show.  You know what we need now?  A submarine.  Can we have an Opie and Anthony submarine to launch a Polaris missile or something? 
[00:08:30]  How cool would that be?  We're like Batman.  We need a chopper.  A chopper.  A chopper.  I'm so glad we have a goddamn airplane now.  This is great.  The Air Force.  This rocks.  And then wait until the nice weather gets, the nice summer hot weather gets here.  Yeah.  We're going to get the boats out there with the...  We'll have our Navy.  We've done the boat thing.  Yeah.  Because, you know, people, I mean, they're cruising all over the place, and they want 
[00:09:00]  the girls to wow as they're, you know, tooling by on their speedboats.  Where are the rooshkies with some MiGs?  We need some MiGs up there.  Like it or not, this will be the most popular radio show in New York City.  I'm waiting.  It cannot stop us.  I'm waiting for this.  People are trying to stop us left and right, but you know what?  This will be the most popular radio show in New York City.  God damn it.  I'm waiting for this.  Mission Control.  It's Space Shuttle Atlantis.  We are about to launch the latest satellite out of the shuttle bay. 
[00:09:30]  There it goes.  Hey, look.  There's a WOW sticker on it.  Wouldn't that be great if we could get someone from NASA to slap a WOW sticker on one of  their satellites they launched?  Anything's possible.  At this point, you know, a while back, that would have seemed ludicrous.  Anything now is possible.  It is in the realm of possibility.  Yes.  I want a WOW sticker orbiting the globe. 
[00:10:00]  Anything's possible.  Wouldn't that rock?  All right.  So I could do that right at the last minute.  He just whap, slaps a WOW sticker on a satellite.  Well, here's the deal.  Mom will be in the sky today.  Yep.  Over Central Park.  If this guy pulls it off, I'm going to freak.  He's ready to go.  We've done some crazy things in our little radio career.  This would go right to the top.  I think.  Look at this.  A guy just got a new boat.  He wants to name it.  Wow.  Name it.  On the back of the boat.  Wow.  Do it up, man.  Do it up.  All right.  Listen, there are some great phone calls on hold. 
[00:10:30]  We want every single one of these people to stay on hold, okay?  We'll talk to you guys next.  We've got to talk about the radio chick.  We've got to talk about enemy of the show.  We've got a really funny e-mail I've got to read.  Yeah.  And, of course, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Ladies, take care of the guys that have their wows on their cars, okay?  It would be greatly appreciated.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  What does Dr. Zachary Smith think of Whip Em Out Wednesday, Opie?  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Yes, she is, Dr. Smith. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yes, indeed.  Very naughty.  How about Whip Em Out Wednesday for young boy asses?  Woo!  I put a wire stick on my car, driving all of a sudden.  A hairless boy ass in my window.  Oh, dear.  Woo!  William, William, pull down your pants.  Oh, dear.  I'm over here now.  All right, Ant, let's take a quick break.  Rock. 
[00:11:30]  We have just begun.  We're in a very good mood.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  We've got perfect weather for this today.  A guy's writing, Mom, in the sky.  It's only going to get better from here.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  212-757.  1027 is our phone line.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie, I just put a bid in for a Juliet-class Soviet submarine.  Like, the bids are up to the millions and stuff, but I got my bid in. 
[00:12:00]  You got a bid in?  We can probably collect a few bucks from all our listeners to get that.  We need a wow sub.  This sounds pretty good.  It's 297 feet long.  Okay.  It could go down to a depth of 775 feet.  Very nice.  With a crushed depth of 1,200 feet.  Very good.  And the important thing, 18 type 53 dual-purpose passive-active torpedoes.  Wow.  Coming up to 13 miles at 55 miles per hour.  And four stern tubes. 
[00:12:30]  I'm in.  That rocks.  We could put a big wow on it and start torpedoing ships.  Why not?  We could get all the scuba divers to wow us while we're down there.  Pearl divers.  Nice.  Thanks, Rich.  It is Whip-A-Melt Wednesday.  We're very excited.  The season has begun.  Yeah.  I noticed a huge increase on the wow signage on the highways and byways today.  Thank you, guys.  It's only going to get better because we're still getting the whole promotion together again.  Right, Anthony?  Yeah.  And, of course, we encourage everyone to send in their wow pictures because a lot of people 
[00:13:00]  take pictures of their homemade signs and what they see on the highways to the unofficial  Opie and Anthony website, www.foundrymusic.com.  Steve will take all those pics and make a collage or something on the website.  Okay?  Right.  All right, Anthony.  Let's go to the phones.  Okay.  Let's start with Andrew today.  Andrew, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I want to congratulate you on all the success.  A few months ago, you said it would happen.  Now, N.E.W. is now known as the Opie and Anthony Station. 
[00:13:30]  That's right.  Congratulations on that.  But you've got to give a lot of credit to the radio chick.  The radio chick doing a fine job, yes.  Big news story on her last night on Channel 11 News.  I saw the piece.  I thought it was great.  You know, I meant to tell everyone to check it out.  We got so busy.  I meant to call up, too.  I didn't get a chance to.  Yeah.  But I know it was pretty funny.  I had the news on, right?  No, no.  I think Friends was on or something.  And they were doing a promo for the news.  And they have all the voices of the girls that are in this little competition and little 
[00:14:00]  news expose on.  So I'm in the middle of doing something.  I'm not going to say what it is.  But, you know, very...  You were screwing?  No, no, no.  Well, you're very close.  And all of a sudden, I hear the radio chick.  Tuttilingus?  I'm like, I had to lift my head up.  Oh, okay.  I had to lift my head up and go, what?  What did I just hear?  You were diving for pearls?  What?  I said I'm not going to get into any details here.  Well, what else would you be doing if you had to lift your head up? 
[00:14:30]  Well, the instant feedback would come pouring in that I was being a homo, I'm sure.  Anyway, okay.  So, yeah.  You heard the radio chick's name.  And you were like, what?  You kind of distracted me for a second.  You lifted your head up.  What was that?  A lot of people think that you have a little crush on the radio chick.  And I got to just bring it out on the air.  No, we're good friends.  A lot of email comes in, a lot of instant feedback.  It was a little wacky tension when she first got here.  I don't know where it came from, but that's all gone.  It's just, you know, friends. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  She's a good friend, friend of the show.  And we protect her.  She protects us.  Right.  And I thought the piece on her last night on Channel 11 was very good.  Bravo.  Bravo is right.  So thank you for that, Andrew.  No problem, guys.  All right.  Matter of fact, you know.  Over and out, Tim and Dustin.  Thank you.  We need the O&A Army to help out the radio chick.  Yeah.  Because I guess they're doing some kind of wacky poll on the WB11 website.  Yeah.  You go to WB11.com. 
[00:15:30]  Mm-hmm.  Don't spell out 11.  It's just WB11.com, okay?  Yeah.  And they're doing a poll trying to figure out who the most popular radio diva is in New York City.  And, you know, the radio chick is being really cool about it.  And some of the other stations involved in this contest are just stuffing the ballot box, and it's just not fair.  And so I told the radio chick that we would have our listeners, like, just completely help her out with the contest. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Well, this is something, I guess, like, Leslie gets a lot of press.  She's getting very popular and everything.  And this is something that these other chicks feel is, like, the biggest thing that's ever going to happen to them.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, because all they do is spin records.  I mean, I think the radio chick is the only one that actually tries to do a real radio show.  Yeah.  The other one's, wow, and real tough to spin the latest from the Backstreet Boys 100 times a week.  Wow.  Is that Light FM chick the same one that's in the commercial with Terry Garr? 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  How insulting a commercial is that, where Terry Garr is sitting next to you?  You go, this is how you get more music and less talk.  We'll demonstrate now.  And this Valerie chick pushes a button and smiles, and the song changes.  And that's the commercial.  So, if you were this chick, wouldn't you be like, could you just put a monkey next to, what's-her-facey there?  Just put a monkey next to Terry Garr to push the button.  Yeah.  Because what they're saying is, I have nothing. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, you're pretty much showing the whole world that you do nothing.  I can't talk.  They've taped my mouth shut.  Right.  It's embarrassing.  It really is.  If you're in this business, you don't want to admit that you're just singing records and doing, you know, rock blocks and stuff.  And you go to the website.  What?  Or Channel 11.  Oh, someone does.  I'm sorry.  That wasn't a date.  But you know what I mean.  Yeah.  Like, 40-minute music sweeps, let's say.  I mean, every music marathon.  There's plenty of things you could call them.  I just used the wrong term.  But you don't want to admit to anyone else that that's what your job is, to spin 40-minute music sweeps and stuff. 
[00:17:30]  And what other of these chicks has the balls to show their cans?  Do you see the pictures of these girls?  Yes.  All right.  Linda Lopez.  I got to give her.  She's pretty cute looking.  I know Linda from the old days.  Yeah.  She worked at BAB.  She's Jennifer's sister.  Who's this Kiss FM chick?  Shalia.  I don't know.  Yeah, baby.  She's got that cafe latte.  I don't know. 
[00:18:00]  Looks like an old Donna Summer picture or something, you know?  That could be an old picture.  She's probably a hag now.  And then the Z100 chick?  I don't know.  No, there's nothing going on there.  That looks like that publicity shot.  I wouldn't say that's the first one they took.  No.  You know?  No.  And then Valerie.  They used a very special lens for that picture.  Yeah.  I think they used a heart lens.  Yeah.  There's a lot of Vaseline on that lens.  And is that the chair behind her or her shirt? 
[00:18:30]  Because it looks like she's wearing a...  It could be her shoulders.  Linebacker shoulder pads.  It could be her shoulders.  If that's the case, let's call her up.  We could use somebody like her on the Jets.  Glamour shot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is like a glamour shot.  It does look like that.  And there's our own Leslie Gould.  Yes.  With her cans.  Her luscious cans just pouring out of her exposed brassiere.  Yes.  It's great.  So we need the ONA Army today to attack the WB11.com website and vote for Leslie Gould. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Because it turns out these other pigs are cheating and stuff in the ballot box.  I'm going to do it right now.  There we go.  I just clicked.  And I just voted for her as well.  And submit.  Let me see.  Let's see what the standings are like here.  Mm-hmm.  One.  One.  Fifteen.  It's taking a while to load, isn't it?  I guess what you've got to do is...  I guess everyone's pouring in.  Yeah.  That's all right. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, all right.  She's in the lead a little bit.  That's good, though.  We want to make her way in the lead, Anthony.  Yeah.  So the ONA Army, help us out today.  WB11.com.  Vote for Leslie Gould, the radio chick, okay?  Do it up.  Because all the other stupid stations are stuffing the ballot.  And I guess the radio chick's too polite to get pissed about it.  But we'll get pissed for her.  It has gotten close.  50%.  And the Z100 chick's got like 47. 
[00:20:00]  She had nothing.  Right.  She had like 10% the other day.  Yeah.  Well, because there's stuff in the ballot box.  Yeah.  All right.  Let her rip, man.  All right.  Mary Beth from Long Beach writes on the Instant Feedback.  Hey, guys, what exactly qualifies as a true wow?  Is showing your bra a true wow?  Would that piss the guys off?  My boobs are big.  36D.  And it's tough to whip them out of my bra.  I would love to wow, but can only open the shirt and show the bra.  Need to know.  Well, Mary Beth, we don't want to start a precedent here, but showing your bra is good. 
[00:20:30]  It's better than nothing.  It's better than nothing, though.  Yeah, but, I mean, a true wow, I'm not going to lie to you, is showing your cans.  Right.  It's not a true wow.  It's not a true wow, but it's kind of like, here you go.  Here's a little tease, I guess.  You're not going the distance.  Yeah, you really got to try to go the distance.  Yeah.  But if you have no choice in the matter and this is all you can pull off real fast, then  it's dangerous to say it's okay.  It's not really okay, but I guess the guys would smile a little bit. 
[00:21:00]  But they need, like, the full Monty, let's say.  Yeah.  The full boob Monty.  All right?  Yeah.  All right.  Jeez, man.  We don't want to start that precedent.  Let's go to Jenny.  Jenny, Jenny, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, LB?  How are you?  Nothing much.  I'm great.  Nothing much.  That is the wrong answer.  I am nervous right now.  I've been waiting on hold for, like, 20 minutes.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Sorry about that.  What's going on?  I'm at Port Jeff right now in Port Jeff Station, I think.  Uh-huh.  I drove out here to Suffolk, so I could hop on the LE at, like, exit 64,  and I was going to hop in the middle lane and wow people,  but when I drove up here earlier today,  there were no wow signs whatsoever on the road.  See, you guys are crazy.  I'm telling you.  All you have to do is put the wow in your car,  and the lovely Jenny would wow you.  Right, Jenny?  I would be much obliged to wow.  My friend wants to have a wow thing at his mom's bar. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  For you guys.  Well, we don't need to do those things.  Those went horribly wrong in the past.  Oh, okay.  You know, there was a certain person that was putting wow parties together  and pocketing all the money, and it just wasn't a good thing.  Oh, that's not a good thing at all.  Buying engagement rings and stuff with the wow money.  Watch out.  You're going to end up on the people's court, Opie.  Anyway, but if you're going to be on the LIE and you're going to, you know,  wow, we would love that. 
[00:22:30]  Okay, I will probably be leaving here around, like, 4 o'clock,  and 3.34 o'clock-ish.  All right, well, that gives the guys a chance to get the wow in their car  and get on the LIE.  Yeah, guys, get your wow signs up.  Look for a navy blue Tahoe.  Oh, man, don't give out your car.  You're crazy.  That's what they call me.  All right.  Oh, by the way, if I knew Spaz was such a pussycat list,  then I would have started dating him a long time ago  and made me buy a penthouse in Manhattan.  Yeah, there you go.  There's no money left, though. 
[00:23:00]  All right, Jenny, happy wowing, okay?  Okay, thank you.  All right, bye.  Bye-bye.  Speaking of wow, did Earl leave yet for the Ranch 1 sticker stop yet?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, because we want him there at 4.  We're going to be handing out the brand-new wow stickers  at Ranch 1, 42nd Street, and 5th Avenue.  You'll see the wow van.  You'll see Earl.  You'll see the crowd,  and you'll be able to get your wow sticker, okay?  Tommy from Staten Island checking in,  getting wowed by a girl in a bra is like getting a BJ with your pants on. 
[00:23:30]  Got to agree with Tommy.  Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right, you know.  I was trying to be nice, but ladies, if you're going to commit,  you've got to go the distance.  All right?  Let's go to Wanda real fast.  Wanda, what's going on?  Wanda.  Hello.  How are you, Wanda?  Good.  We got you live on the air.  What's going down?  Oh, well, I just had to say that, well,  in this syndication underground,  I send tapes out to my brother in Idaho.  Oh, thank you.  We love the bootleg tapes.  And he spreads it around to all his friends. 
[00:24:00]  Cool.  I do have to get some wow stickers for him, though.  Just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  We'll send them out.  Cool.  All right?  But, yeah, they really like it out there.  Oh, cool.  Thanks.  Well, hello to Idaho.  Thank you, Wanda.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Idaho.  Earl, what are you still doing here?  Oh, boy.  I'm just walking out the door.  Are you going to be there at 4 o'clock today?  Yes, I am.  Why are you getting pissed?  Oh, boy.  I'm ready to leave.  Do you need someone to go with you? 
[00:24:30]  Someone wants to come with me fine,  but I'm ready to leave.  Psycho Mark, do you want to go with him?  Only if he's nice and he has a smile on his face.  I am smiling.  No, you're not.  You're a miserable F.  I'm smiling.  Look at me.  Oh, there's a smile.  He tried coming into the office the other night again  with the Billy Club.  He loves that nightstick.  God.  It's frightening.  All right.  Well, why don't you guys leave?  There's a lot of people waiting for you around here.  He's going to be at the door.  All right, man.  Get your wow sticker at Ranch Warren, 42nd Street and 5th Avenue.  They'll be there in four hours.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  No, they're supposed to be there at four.  Keep your fingers crossed.  Oh, calm down, Earl.  Come on, Earl.  You know something, Earl?  Earl, you've got the easiest job in the world,  and you get pissed off every day.  You have completely lost your sense of humor  over the course of the time we've been here.  You had the sense of humor.  You were kind of a fun guy, relatively speaking.  And, you know, now, I don't know.  Every little thing now we've got to worry is it's going to upset Earl.  And then you're going to go hiding under, like, staircases and stuff. 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  Remember?  We were all having fun.  What happened?  Didn't the fans love you yesterday, Fidelity Diamond?  Weren't they cheering you on?  I agree, too.  There you go.  See?  You got some adulation yesterday, Earl.  Ah, my fans, my public, the adulation.  I am Rock Quarry.  You might remember me from Dr. Jekyll's Hyde.  Ah!  All right, there he is. 
[00:26:00]  He's smiling.  There he goes.  All right.  Well, Earl, go have some fun.  I'm ready to rock.  Ready to rock.  That's what we want to hear.  I'm over here.  And if you're going down to 42nd Street and 5th Avenue,  the Ranch One location,  don't start the I'm over here now.  That's not yours, man.  I was going to go.  Wait, one minute.  I'm, like, not having a sense of humor.  We already have a clip of you from yesterday  when you were trying to find Fidelity Diamond.  Yeah.  You ever hear that one, Earl?  We recorded you yesterday in the band.  Here he is.  Oh!  Oh!  Help me! 
[00:26:30]  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me!  Help me!  Oh, Lordy, Lord!  He's desperate!  Do what he's saying!  Do what he's saying!  See, he's laughing.  Earl loves Clevon Little.  I love Clevon Little.  Clevon rules.  He does.  Well, yeah, he's dead now.  Yeah.  Okay.  Vinny from Rosedale.  If you wanted Earl there at 4,  he should have left at 10.  All right.  Well, we'll check in with you guys when you get there, okay?  Thank you, Earl, for helping out the wow thing. 
[00:27:00]  Don't take the road that'll take you to the New York or the New Jersey-Connecticut border.  I am not.  That's purse fat.  You want me to go to MapQuest.com and get you a map?  I am not drunk.  Yeah, we'll print you out a map.  I am not drunk.  You want us to print you out a map?  You should be okay, right?  I'm fine.  Okay.  See, Manhattan works on a grid system, it's called, Earl.  So, what street do you have to get to?  42nd.  42nd.  And 5th F.  And we're at where? 
[00:27:30]  We are at 57th and 7th?  Right.  So, you would head south, thus the street numbers decline, okay?  And make them head east first.  The Times Square is a nightmare.  You want to do that?  Yeah.  Can you go east?  That might throw them for a loop.  Can you go east first and then head south?  What is driving that?  Directions, just point that way, this way.  All right, Earl.  Have fun.  They're waiting for you.  Only in a bit.  Okay, very good.  Be nice to Earl if you see him out there.  He's on edge lately. 
[00:28:00]  All right, Anthony, as we go to break,  we've got to thank Jimmy.  Jimmy works his ass off for the radio show.  You don't really hear his voice on the air.  He does all the fine production that you hear,  or a lot of the production you hear on our show.  Yeah.  And he put together a really, really funny piece yesterday.  Makes me look like a raving lunatic, but...  Well, I think it speaks volumes.  It's very...  The truth.  It's very, very funny.  It's called Opie and the Shut Up Promo. 
[00:28:30]  I guess they've been isolating a lot of my tantrums.  Your tirades.  And they put together a little piece that had everyone around here laughing, so...  You're a nut.  So let's play this as we go into a break, okay?  All right.  All right.  Our listeners are so quick and with it.  Steven.  Or whoever your name is.  All right.  Me?  Yeah, well, yes, you.  You just spoke.  Go ahead.  Talk.  You.  Yeah, me?  Yeah, what's your name?  Steven.  Well, what?  You fucking asshole.  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:00]  Son of a bitch!  How stupid do you have to be to be on the phone and someone calls your name and you don't answer?  All I want to do is to be shut up!  You fucking asshole!  You fucking asshole! 
[00:29:30]  You fucking asshole!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Did he just lose his effing mind?  No!  Open the air man for days.  I hate people that don't get it.  God damn, does that piss me off!  I'm a freaking limited thing.  You are.  W27.  WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah, it works.  Come on.  Yes, it does.  Lose that weight. 
[00:30:00]  Drop those pounds.  You don't want the big fat ace.  I might have to lose the stacker two.  It's making me a little edgy.  Yeah, I can tell from that last promo.  I get a little edgy on stacker two.  My God.  No, that's not true.  I'm not.  I just started taking stacker two again.  Yeah.  All that audio was from the past.  Mm-hmm.  Before I found value.  Anyway, Anthony, stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday is here.  It's a beautiful day.  Summer right around the corner. 
[00:30:30]  People trying to get their bodies in shape for the beach and stuff.  And, hey, why not try stacker two?  A lot of other people have.  Mm-hmm.  And it's working for them.  I'm hearing the success stories all the time.  People losing 50, 60, 70 pounds on this stuff.  That's crazy.  Hearing good things.  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  It burns the fat off your body.  It gives you a boost of energy late in the day when you're feeling a little sluggish.  And it crushes the cravings to, what, snacking between meals, Anthony?  Of course.  You know, that's where you put on a lot of pounds when you start snacking in between the meals. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So it's stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  You can see them on the Internet, www.stacker2.com, or give them a call, 1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Our listeners have proven it works.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Opie and Anthony.  Yes, yes.  We're out of control. 
[00:31:30]  We're so happy.  All right.  Knock it off.  1027-WNEW.  What a day, what a day, what a day.  2-1-2-7-5-7.  1-2-7 is our phone line.  We're trying to get some girls in here tomorrow for the hot wax thing.  Hot wax.  Yeah, any ladies want to come down and help us out?  We got Louis Black coming in tomorrow.  We got yellow spaz tomorrow.  Yeah.  If you don't know what that's about, spaz, you're going to be in a Boy Scout uniform outside the station. 
[00:32:00]  We found out that he's like $47,000 in debt.  We're going to try to help him out a little bit.  A lot of the listeners really, really pissed off and hate spaz.  Guys, we're going to give you a chance to yell and scream at him.  Everyone wins.  You get to yell at him.  And he gets to keep some of his credit rating, I guess.  Yeah, we'll be hanging outside the station tomorrow, 57th and 7th.  Spaz will be in his Boy Scout uniform.  He will have a sign that says, yell at me for $5.  You hand over the $5 to Rick.  Can't touch him. 
[00:32:30]  And you can say whatever the hell you want.  It should be some funny, funny stuff tomorrow.  Yeah.  I don't know if spaz can handle it.  We'll see if he goes postal tomorrow.  There are a lot of bets going around the office when spaz will go postal.  My brothers are convinced of it.  They are convinced he will go postal eventually.  Louis Black tomorrow, like we said, and we need girls to come down to get hot waxed.  If you don't know what that's about, you get semi-naked,  and Aunt and I drip hot wax all over your body.  You moan and scream, and everyone has a good time. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, it doesn't hurt much.  Because Louis Black always gets gypped when he comes in here.  He wants to see some of the fun stuff.  We once showed him a midget or something, but he wants the good stuff.  We had a couple of chicks in here, I think, once when he was here.  Lesbian for a day?  Yeah.  Was he part of one of those?  Yeah.  All right.  He was mesmerized.  Okay.  Well, Anthony, I got a great email.  All right.  I was going through the email for the show before the show.  I got to say, once again, too, you guys, thank you for all the email.  We read all your email. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  That's the God's honest truth.  Every single one, even the ones that hate us and all that.  But we just can't answer everyone back.  So don't think, you know, I'm sending off my email.  No one cares.  No one's reading this.  It's not true.  We've read all the ones that say, you guys don't read these, do you?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I do answer some of them back and they're like, oh, who's signing Opie's name?  No, it's me.  But we get some great ideas from you guys.  That's why we do read all the email.  We get some great clips from you guys.  Yeah.  You know?  I think we got the stupid, you're so stupid from one of our listeners. 
[00:34:00]  They sent that in.  So thank you for all the email.  Just, you know, don't be bummed if we don't write you back.  But we are reading everything.  I must have blown before email.  Like if you did a radio show and people wanted to write you, you would have to sit there and open all the envelopes, read them.  And then if you want to answer somebody back, kind of take it for granted now.  It's instant, you know?  Yeah.  Someone asks you a question, you just type it in, send, and within minutes they could have the answer that they wanted.  Isn't that amazing?  It used to be.  If you really think about it. 
[00:34:30]  Someone would have a question, they'd have to sit down, write your letter, mail it.  When you finally got to it, you would open it up, read it.  But then when you finally got to the point where you could write them back, you'd write it back and then have to mail it back.  It could take, like, weeks or months before you get your answer.  Pain in the ass.  Yeah.  Anyway, we got a great one from Mike P.  Hey, Toxic Twins.  Oh, boy.  A lot of people starting to call us that again.  That was our nickname up in Boston.  We did it.  Your loyal legions of fans heeded your call yesterday and took arms against the Indian Link message board. 
[00:35:00]  We talked about that yesterday.  I don't think we have to get into it again.  But IndianLink.com, I believe it was, was the enemy of the show yesterday, Anthony.  Yep.  Okay.  Well, Mike P. continues.  I must say the news from the front is good.  The battle was a complete success.  As of this morning, if one goes to the Indian Link forum, it says that it is temporarily down for maintenance.  Now, our fearless leaders, I ask you this.  Should we continue? 
[00:35:30]  Once the board is back up, are we to continue our bombardment of the enemy?  Or should we just sit back and watch as they complain about us in very broken English?  I don't know why it was so much fun.  It's almost disturbing how enjoyable it was to take the enemy down.  Yeah.  Your loyal servant, Mike P.  That was a gnat.  That was nothing.  That was just a little flare-up battle.  Yeah.  Took care of that situation in less than 24 hours.  They weren't expecting it.  No.  They weren't expecting the bombardment. 
[00:36:00]  No.  But when we declare an enemy of the show, the listeners react, go into combat mode, and  yeah, within 24 hours, the forum completely shut down.  And it's funny, too, because you see what kind of sense of humor our listeners have.  I was pissed off when they closed it because I wanted to read some of them.  I get online at night at home, and I was punching up this message board laughing out loud at some  of the stuff the listeners were coming up with.  Yeah, you guys come up with great stuff. 
[00:36:30]  That's the type of stuff we're reading on a daily basis through this instant feedback.  Yeah.  But when it gets on a public message board, you guys get to see what we get to read every  day.  You guys are ruthless.  It was great.  So I guess that battle's over, Anthony.  I think we made our point.  Yeah, there you go.  I believe we've destroyed the enemy in this case.  Indianlink.com is no longer a threat to the Opie and Anthony show and their fans.  Yeah, we'll stand down a bit.  We're on standby mode.  Once this thing kicks back up, if they rear their ugly head again, we'll squash them like 
[00:37:00]  a bug.  We'll squash them again.  I don't want to see any posts on that message board about how we don't like Pakistan.  F-Pakistan.  Right.  So we need a couple troops to just kind of look over the situation, make sure everything's  okay there.  Just monitor it, yeah.  A little monitoring situation will let us know.  What we're encouraging the Army to do today is to go to WB11.com.  Yeah.  The radio chick is in a little battle of her own there, and we said we'd help her out. 
[00:37:30]  They're doing some kind of radio diva poll, and we found out that there's a few other  stations cheating in the balloting.  They're stuffing the ballot box.  So I told Leslie that we would set the Army on the WB11.com website.  All we're asking you to do there is just to vote for the radio chick.  Do you think they're abusing the term diva?  Do you really think, like everyone is, WWF used it in their magazine, WWF divas? 
[00:38:00]  You know, it should have been WWF diesels, considering the fact that some of those girls look like men.  Yeah, that whole diva concept would be H1 is done.  Yeah.  Now everything's a diva.  If it's got cans, it's a diva.  They're radio chicks, you know?  They're ladies of the radio.  They're radio sluts.  Oh, my God.  Our own Leslie is in there. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  She's the best looking one out of the bunch.  And isn't that what it's all about?  Yeah.  I mean, look at it.  Look at the pictures.  Leslie's got her cans hanging out.  You go, why wouldn't you vote for that?  My God.  So WB11.com, vote for the radio chick.  That's all we're asking you guys to do today, okay?  Right.  All right.  Let's go to Joey. 
[00:39:00]  Hey, Joey, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  How are you?  Hey, dude.  Dude, you can't curse.  Start over.  Start over.  Listen to this.  287, if anybody's on there going north, there is hot chicks in a white Lincoln.  Hello?  Yeah, we're listening.  I got wowed, and I got banana juice all over the place.  The yam bag's going crazy.  It's insane.  All right.  So you got wowed today on 287?  Oh, my God.  Look for these two girls in the car.  So you got a homemade wow sign on your car? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Oh, very good.  Well, thank you for helping us out, Joey.  All right, boys.  All right, man.  There he goes, Joey.  He got wowed.  Doesn't sound too excited about it.  No, I think he wanted more to get on the air and use some of Dice's words.  Yeah.  More than just reporting a wow.  All right, Anthony, and if you want to get your wow sticker today, it's black girl once again  hitting the highway.  Yeah.  With Psycho Mark.  They're going to be at the Ranch 1 location on 42nd Street and 5th Avenue.  Just look for the wow van, Earl, Psycho Mark, and hopefully a crowd out there. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  You can pick up your wow sticker.  Okay?  Yeah.  All right, and we've got to take a quick break, and we'll be back.  We're for my Wednesday now.  We're for my Wednesday.  We've been out.  It's come out.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, lady now. 
[00:40:30]  Come on, lady.  Come on and open your blouse.  Open your blouse.  Flash your boobies and girls.  Flash your boobies and girls.  Show your melons to guys.  Show your melons to guys.  It's going to hang below the dashboard.  Below the dashboard.  We'll lift those babies up high.  Lift those babies up high.  Woo.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.

[00:41:00]  Yeah know.  Fly them around.  Fly them around.  Come on, come on.  Come on.  Lay them in a mountain.  This is what wow is about.  This is what wow is about.  You've got to lose bat music.  Lose bat music.  And let the fun back bounce.  Fly them in a mountain.  Say the smoke put my sack語.  Put my sack語 Gonna tell jokes.  Come out.  Let those jokes come out.  Woo.  We're looking for a few good enemas. 
[00:41:30]  What the hell are you talking about?  Opie and Anthony Show.  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony Diamond Vision and Dr. Philitoff.  Yeah, gave Opie his eyesight.  Yeah, thank you, Dr. Philitoff.  I haven't thanked you enough lately.  Opie was able to throw his glasses away. 
[00:42:00]  And the biggest part, I think, from what I saw, was your fear and apprehension before the procedure.  Well, I did the research for our listeners.  Simple as that.  I mean, because I know a lot of people are looking into doing this.  I researched this thing for over a year because I was really scared.  Because if you read about the procedure, it's a little scary.  I'm not going to lie to you.  But, you know, I finally picked Dr. Philitoff.  I felt like he was the best man for the job.  And I'll tell you the truth, it was a piece of cake.  Yeah.  It was a piece of cake.  He sat down with you, talked to you, and you were fine with it. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And then 20 minutes in his office, you walk out of there fine and dandy.  Well, 24 hours later, obviously, in 2015.  Yeah.  2015.  Still see 2015.  Every day, still amazed.  Ready to check out some cans on the highway.  Yeah.  Before, I'd have to fumble with my glasses and stuff so I wouldn't miss a wowing or something.  Now, I'm ready to go.  All I have to do is turn my head.  I've got the peripheral vision and everything, Anthony.  You're set. 
[00:43:00]  I'm set.  Yes.  Cool.  It's Dr. Philitoff and Diamond Vision.  There's a couple things going on.  He's running another little contest, if you will.  Giving away eyesight.  Giving away eyesight to one of our listeners.  All you have to do is call 1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020, and you'll be in the drawing for a free procedure, Anthony, courtesy of Dr. Philitoff.  Okay?  Nice.  1-800-984-2020.  If you registered for a past contest or free procedure, your name will be in the drawing for this one as well. 
[00:43:30]  Okay?  Also, Diamond Vision has made it affordable.  They're running a spring special, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  For just $2,500, you'll get both eyes done.  Both.  Yes.  Usually, the procedure is $2,500 per eye.  Yeah.  So, they've cut the cost down in half for you if you call Diamond Vision and ask for the spring special.  $2,500.  Okay?  It's Diamond Vision.  Give them a call.  1-800-984-2020.  That's 1-800-984-2020.  I'm Opie and Anthony. 
[00:44:00]  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, I just, like, want to throw up.  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  It's the O&A Show.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  The wow season has begun. 
[00:44:30]  Very excited about it.  The phone's just going nuts.  People are getting wowed.  We're liking that.  Some guy got wowed in Baltimore.  Let's go to Rob.  Hey, Rob.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hope you're in it.  Yeah, I got wowed.  I was on my way down to D.C.  And I just put the sticker in my window this past weekend.  And I was like, I was driving through Jersey looking all over, hoping something was going  to happen.  Nothing.  I get down to Baltimore. 
[00:45:00]  I completely forgot I had it in there.  Sure enough, I'm like driving and I see these two girls next to me.  I'm like, they're waving.  I'm like, what the, you know, what's going on here?  Next thing you know, I like, boom.  Came down, back up again.  They took off.  I was like, oh.  There you go.  Very cool, Rob.  You guys rule.  All right.  Thanks, Rob.  See you.  Bye.  It's working.  Another happy customer.  Hey, why don't you explain to the people, though.  I mean, you just don't put the wow sticker on your car and expect something to happen within  five minutes.  No, no. 
[00:45:30]  You know, you got to be patient with it.  It's like fishing or anything else, you know.  You put it on there, you forget about it.  Before you know it, you're driving home, you're in traffic, you're miserable.  You look out your window and you see a luscious pair of cans in your face.  And you go, what?  Why?  Why is that girl flesh?  All these thoughts go through your head.  And then all of a sudden, he's like, oh.  Oh, my God.  I just got wowed.  I got wowed.  And you're freaking.  And then you go, thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  You're loving it.  Yes.  Bringing your boobs on your commute home.  Andrew from Long Island.  This morning on Family Feud, one of the questions was, name one unattractive part of the male 
[00:46:00]  body.  Eh, I can't think of one.  A lady says, the butt.  But, so Louie Anderson screams out, show me the butt.  Show me the butt.  The unattractive part of the male body.  And the lady said, butt.  Butt, yeah.  And Louie Anderson screams out, because he screams out, show me the butt.  I would love a clip of him saying that.  Yeah, if anyone has that, please send it in.  He had a dumb smile on his face when he said this, too. 
[00:46:30]  It was real funny, considering how you've been going nuts on him.  Of course.  Hey, Louie Anderson, Family Feud.  Show me the butt.  Unattractive part of the male body.  I can't really think of one.  I like them all.  I like everything from, you know, the feet, the head and neck, and the butt.  Hell, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Penis.  Show me the penis.  Unattractive part of a woman's body.  Let's see.  Gee, the whole package.  I don't like it out of that thing.  Women, ew, they smell bad.  I don't like those boobs.  Unless they're big man boobs.  Show me man boobs.  I got them.  Show me buttocks.  Louie, I don't know how he could go on TV now that that whole thing's out. 
[00:47:30]  That some guy got arrested trying to pay him off to keep him quiet.  Yeah, the guy was blackmailing Louie Anderson.  Blackmail.  Oh, it gives me shivers when you say blackmail.  Yeah, I'm turning the tragedy into comedy.  I always get that backwards because my comedy is a tragedy.  Show me buttocks.  Hey, Bill, what's going on? 
[00:48:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Bill.  First, I want to thank you.  I'm home.  I just got the laser surgery.  Wait, you're homo?  No, home.  Oh.  Home recovering.  Who's going to get your number?  I got laser surgery and for five hours every afternoon, I know I got something to do.  Oh, cool.  Anyway, I was sitting home.  I had the TV.  I was flipping around.  Here's Louie Anderson.  It was nose hair, ear hair, but the worst was for the third strike, they go and they go 
[00:48:30]  to steal.  It's like, what's the most ugly part?  And the guy says, all right, man's private parts.  So Louie Anderson has a look on his face like, oh, God, I got to say this.  He turns to the big board.  He's like, show me private.  Private.  Show me big men private parts.  It was ugly.  Show me.  What do you mean to my face?  And then.  Are they ugly?  I've never seen mine.  To top it off.  My belly gets in the way.  My big, fat Louie Anderson belly. 
[00:49:00]  To top it off, as if it couldn't get any better in the next version.  Because they have a 1230 show.  And obviously I have not much to do with myself.  It's, uh, he's going to the guy and he says, so what do you do for a living?  And this guy tells him, well, I'm a paramedic.  And so Lee says, well, if I pass down, make sure you revive me.  The guy says, I'll be right on top of you.  Giving you mouth to mouth.  Ah.  And again, Louie was like, oh, wouldn't that be lovely? 
[00:49:30]  Show me a junk.  That's great.  Show me yam bags.  Anyway, guys, I wanted to let you know what happened.  And, uh, I got, uh, my request in for my, uh, wow sticker.  Oh, good, though.  I'm going on vacation next week.  And I figure entering the plane, I might just slap it right on the side.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Show me yam bags.  Show me anal sex.  I can't wait until that one comes up.  I love it.  I'm over queer now. 
[00:50:00]  So it looks like Louie Anderson having fun on the Family Feud this morning.  Yeah.  If anyone has a tape of that, we would love to see it.  Boy, who's, who's the poor, like, gay guy that has to take, uh, take Louie's money?  Because you know damn well he's just got to be, uh, going, uh, that route.  You know?  Well, I'm just basing my opinion on what I've seen.  And read. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I, I can't be sure about anything on this program, Opie.  But if you ask me, I, I think he would have a hard time getting a young, attractive homo  to, uh, do anything to him.  You know?  So regardless of how he gets it, imagine that poor guy having to, uh, service a Louie Anderson.  That's it.  Oh, that feels so good.  Louie puts his, uh, belly on top of the guy's head.  That's good.  Just him mawning. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Show me pot!  Yeah, you want to roll over?  I'm just going to take this friggin' 500 pounds of fish belly white flesh and just prop it  up on your back.  You're going to feel it rolling on you.  Like so much dough coming out of a hopper pouring on your back.  Then you might feel a little pressure.  Don't worry about that.  It's just my junk. 
[00:51:30]  My Louie junk.  Could you take a look at it and tell me what it looks like?  Draw like a police composite sketch.  I haven't seen it in years.  Look, he'll take a picture of it for you, Louie.  Yeah, snap a photo of my junk.  I don't even know what it looks like.  Yeah.  Oh, that was great.  Look what I did to you again.  You're a whore.  I love hairy man-ass. 
[00:52:00]  You're going to puke in a minute.  Thank you.  I like when my junk almost needs a machete to get through it.  You know, like a jungle picture or something.  Yeah, thank you, Louie, for that visual.  Just hacking away in a virtual jungle before I reach the cave of pleasure.  Show me cave of pleasure!  Oh, brother.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  So, cool.  Right on. 
[00:52:30]  Catch that crunch!  All right, Anthony, we haven't heard from Earl and Psycho Mark, so obviously...  They couldn't get lost.  They're lost.  They're supposed to be at the Ranch 1 on 42nd Street and 5th Avenue.  Yeah.  At 4 o'clock.  It is now 4 minutes to 4 and no sign of the boys.  Hey, is Earl gay?  Where are you going to try that at?  All right, so you can stop there for the WOW sticker.  Yeah.  And supposedly there's a guy that's going to write Mom in the Sky today. 
[00:53:00]  You should be able to see it over Central Park a little later this afternoon.  Now, Mom, oh, thank you.  Well, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Yes, Anthony, Mom.  Mom.  That's what he told the FAA.  Shut up.  Well, it is Mom if you look at it from one direction.  It's WOW if you look from the other.  That's true.  Yeah.  If this guy pulls it off, he'll be my new hero.  Well, we've got an Air Force.  We have an Air Force.  Yeah, if anyone sees it and you're cruising around with a camera. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, it's not going to happen for about, what, he said around an hour.  We have about another hour to wait for that to see if he can pull it off.  I like writing a big W on one ass cheek and a W on the other ass cheek.  And then when I bend over, I got my own WOW.  Or when I do a headstand, it's MOM.  Yeah, that's a big WOW.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  It's more like yuck.  But that O is getting bigger by the minute. 
[00:54:00]  I tell you.  When I take a dump, it sounds like...  Psycho Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guess where I am.  You made it to Ranch 1?  I'm in front of Ranch 1.  All right.  Right in the corner of 5th Avenue, 42nd Street.  And hey, look at that.  It's 4 o'clock.  It's 4 o'clock.  You guys made it.  Congratulations.  Yep.  Now we're here.  Is anyone down there yet?  We've got tons of WOW stickers.  Come on down.  You can't miss us.  Right in the corner.  42nd and 5th Ave. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Very good.  Are people stopping by yet or no?  Oh, there was a bunch of people already waiting for us, so it was great.  Those people walking by right now, they're all grabbing stickers.  Well, that's the hot spot today.  So if there's any ladies in the cars driving by that location, please WOW Psycho Mark and  Earl and everyone that's waiting there.  All right.  Take a look.  Call us when something's going on, all right?  Very good.  All right.  There you go.  Psycho Mark.  He made it to the WOW sticker stop today.  Ranch 1, 42nd and 5th Avenue.  Yeah.  Ah, where are we going? 
[00:55:00]  We're going to Steve real fast.  Steve, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm in the Holland Tunnel.  It just got WOWed.  You did?  In the tunnel?  Yeah.  In the tunnel.  That's pretty nice, huh?  Yeah.  Well, congratulations.  Black Toyota Celica.  Everybody wants to see it over there.  All right, man.  Well, thank you, Steve.  No problem, dude.  All right.  All right.  Nick said I stole a joke from George Carlin.  Nick, really?  Yeah, guys.  How you doing?  What did I steal from George Carlin?  No, not you.  Anthony.  Why?  The WOW thing over there with the two, it's in his book, Braindroppings over there. 
[00:55:30]  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you stole that joke from him.  The two W's on the ass cheeks.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  First of all.  Pimp, Pimp, Pimp, Pimp.  Love the show, guys.  First of all, Ant doesn't read.  Second of all, I don't read.  I'm just kidding.  Yeah.  And second of all, oh, my God, that's like the oldest joke in the book.  The two W's on them.  I know.  I've heard that for years.  Please, come on.  That was a really hot chick out there. 
[00:56:00]  Who was that?  Where's that?  Hang on with Butchie?  What's going on there?  Oh, man.  Damn, you see that blind man?  D.C. checking in, Opie.  Washington, D.C.  Washington, D.C. checking in, yeah?  Loving the show.  Syndication Underground, it's happening.  It's happening all over the place.  I'd like to welcome all the cities across the United States to the Opie and Anthony Network Underground.  Yes.  We have a few in Cali, a few in Boston, a few in Washington. 
[00:56:30]  Idaho.  Idaho.  Arizona.  Arizona.  Hmm.  And international, England and Canada.  Syndication Underground.  It's the only way to do it.  Do whatever it takes, boys and girls, okay?  All right, Ant, let's not regroup, all right?  All right.  A lot of people with stories about getting wowed, but they're kind of boring.  Yeah, we can't just take calls like, hey, we're driving to go wowed, okay.  Yeah.  We want to talk people through it as it's happening.  We want to hear from those people. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, if there's any ladies that see a wow in a car, they're a little nervous, you know,  give us a call, we'll talk you through it.  That type of stuff will be fun, but if we go to the phones and you're like, hey, man,  just got wowed on the LIA, it's going to go.  Oh, great.  It's going to get boring real fast, okay?  All right?  Okay.  Noof.  All right, let's give away some wrestling tickets, Anthony.  Wrestling.  Raw is war coming back to town.  Raw is war.  Monday night at the Coliseum, raw is war.  We'll be there.  Vince McMahon and his family, I'll have Stephanie in a thong bikini match. 
[00:57:30]  I'm waiting for that.  We're looking for some great signage at the Coliseum this coming Monday.  Yeah, please.  WWF tickets, if you're the 10th caller, you'll be checking out Raw is war Monday night at the  Coliseum, 2-1-2, 7-5-7, 1-0-2-7.  What were you going to say?  My favorite sign so far at one of the wrestling matches, hot anal.  Just popping up every two seconds.  Hot anal.  Hot anal.  I like that, boy.  I got to tell you. 
[00:58:00]  Hot anal.  Show me hot anal.  Yeah.  Hot anal.  Right in the O.  Jesus.  All right.  Tickets courtesy of RC Edge Maximum Power Cola fueling the WWF.  We'll be back.  Hey, New York.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF, and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio,  Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW. 
[00:58:30]  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Are we going to get a game of broad bingo together?  You want to do broad bingo today, Anthony?  You know what's so fun about it?  Screw the bingo part.  Girls talking about their boobs.  That would be very nice.  That's a fun, fun thing to do. 
[00:59:00]  Are we getting the cards together or something?  Who's in charge of the broad bingo cards?  You can play along at home.  We'll tell everybody how to play along at home.  You make a bingo card.  And what is that?  Five across, five down, a grid.  Is it five?  Five and five.  B-I-N-G-O.  Yes.  B-I-N-G-O.  Yes.  And bingo was his name off.  Yes.  Five across, five down, a square grid.  You fill it in with random various brassiere sizes. 
[00:59:30]  Correct.  Don't cheat.  What we do is we put about 100 bra sizes in a hat.  And we pick it out and we fill out the cards that way.  So you don't put all the easy sizes.  Yeah, not the common ones.  The popular sizes in a row because then you're going to win right away.  Right.  And then we take calls from girls that will call the program, giving their bra size.  And you check it off like a bingo card.  And the first one to get a bingo wins.  Wins.  And the lady that gives us the winning bra size will win some valuable prizes from the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:00:00]  Yes.  A little incentive for the ladies to call us.  We'll play broad bingo in about 15 minutes.  We'll give people a chance to get their cards together so they can play at home.  Yeah.  Actually, it's going to take Spaz about 15 minutes to figure out where the broad bingo cards are.  Yeah.  The middle square is free boob.  Yeah, we call it the free boob square.  Yes.  You get that one for nothing.  Yes.  And, Anthony, I'm getting a lot of instant feedback here.  People want to know if...  Oh, you made one out, bro? 
[01:00:30]  He knows it.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Well, here.  Give me a blank one.  Yeah, we need blank ones.  Yeah.  There we go.  This one ain't going to work.  All right.  All right.  We got our bingo card.  One, two, three, four, five.  There we go.  We just got to fill them in.  Good.  Broad bingo.  A lot of people are instant feedbacking us and asking if the Spaz thing is happening  tomorrow.  Yes, it is, Anthony.  Yes, it is.  He's going to be in a Boy Scout uniform, his own Boy Scout uniform, from when he reached 
[01:01:00]  Eagle Scout rank.  Right.  Very proud moment, I guess, for the Spaz family when that happened.  We're going to put him out on the street.  You're going to insult him for how much?  Five bucks a shot.  Five bucks.  You could yell at him.  You just can't touch him.  Right.  But you could just berate him.  Yeah.  Yell at him.  He's going to hold a sign, abuse me for five bucks.  Yeah.  And we're going to help get his $47,000 deck down by doing this.  And a lot of people will feel good, because they hear Spaz's Week in Review and all the  other stupid stuff he says on the show, and he gets so pissed off. 
[01:01:30]  And infuriated that you're punching your steering wheel and stuff.  You know.  We'll allow you to vent live tomorrow on our show outside the building, 57th and 7th.  When are we going to start that, Rick?  Probably early in the show?  Yeah, around 4 o'clock.  Around 4 o'clock.  Looking forward to my brother Joe and Cal Bill Bill coming in with a brand new song.  A brand new Spaz Idiot song done to the theme of Shaft.  Right.  So that ought to be, yeah.  I'm looking forward to that one.  Oh, you're a big fan of film flops, right? 
[01:02:00]  Yes, I am, man.  Well, I was the one who turned you on to film flops.  I know, and you ruin movies now for me.  Yeah.  I cannot sit and just watch a movie without picking out these film flops.  And not even movies, like TV shows.  Last night on Frasier, Frasier's wearing this wacky hat, this long, pointed hat.  And every time they would switch scenes, he'd have the point of the hat over the front of his shoulder.  And then all of a sudden it was behind him for no apparent reason.  Every time they switched scenes back and forth, this thing would move. 
[01:02:30]  You can catch this stuff all the time.  It makes watching movies a lot of fun.  And there's books out there.  There's websites dedicated to film flops.  Yeah.  Basically, you know, stuff that doesn't match up in the movie.  Yeah.  I mean, some good examples, like if there's a scene where they're talking in the rain or whatever.  If you look at their hair, it just drastically changes shot to shot and stuff.  Yeah, like wet bangs over to the right, and then all of a sudden they're straight down.  Right.  Or water in a glass when they're eating at a restaurant.  Yeah.  All of a sudden you see they've got a full glass of water in front of them. 
[01:03:00]  They switch to the person they're talking to for like a split second,  and then back to the person again that you were watching, and the glass is empty.  Yes.  Or it was empty, and then it's full again.  Correct.  So last night, it kind of takes you out of the movie, though.  It kind of sucks, because all of a sudden you're like,  ah, totally pulled me out of the movie.  I was watching a Christopher Walken movie, Vendetta.  This thing went straight to video.  Not very good.  But it's about Italians coming over to this country and how they were treated really poorly.  It's kind of funny. 
[01:03:30]  And one part in this movie, they're sitting at this desk.  It's supposed to be about 1890.  Maybe early 1900s.  And they're drinking Jack Daniels.  So they pour the Jack Daniels into a glass and then put the bottle back on the table.  For a split second, you see the UPC code on the bottle of Jack Daniels.  Like, oh, boy, they've been doing that for a while.  When they bought that at the general store, did they scan it through the little beep, beep? 
[01:04:00]  Well, that's being picky with your film flaws.  Well, that's pretty good.  I mean, come on.  It takes you right out of the picture.  I mean, I've been to some of these websites.  They study the cars on the streets during scenes.  If it's like a period piece, let's say the movie was supposed to take place in, I don't know, 1972.  There are people out there that will watch these scenes and go, whoa, that car wasn't around in 1972.  How about in Twister?  That had to be the worst one because Opie and I sat there watching Twister with the remote in one hand going, okay, freeze it. 
[01:04:30]  I got this one.  Well, we had a contest.  We would have contests for a lot of money and stuff.  Yeah.  You, me, and our buddy Jay.  Jay, who could pick out the most film flubs.  Right.  And that one had a great one.  They're driving down the one-lane dirt road.  But when you looked at them from the front out the back window, you see it was a two-lane paved road.  Right.  And cars were passing them by in the scene.  It was ridiculous.  Twister had a ton of them that were just, that didn't make sense with really bad ones.  But that was one I saw last night.  I thought it was pretty funny. 
[01:05:00]  1900 and they're scanning booze bottles down at the general store.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  What's up, O&A?  How are you?  Looking forward to WoW season.  Yes.  Well, it's upon us.  We've got a guy that may be writing WoW in the sky today.  We'll have to wait and see.  I just got my stickers today in the mail.  Oh, cool.  Psych.  How long did it take?  Actually, the first one took about two weeks.  Oh, man.  Anyway, so I sent in another one and I got it the next day.  Cool.  So anyway, I got a film flood from American Pie.  Really?  Okay. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  I was watching it on the DVD the other day.  And there's a scene when there's a girl drinking out of a cup.  I think it's the same cup where the guy, you know, does the thing in the beer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the cup is blue in one scene and they cut away and it's clear.  And I'm like, I'm sitting there watching it with my girlfriend.  And I'm like, I can't believe that they didn't catch that.  Yeah.  Well, you can find film flubs in every single movie ever made.  But it wrecks it because you're not paying attention to the movie.  You're just kind of waiting for film flubs. 
[01:06:00]  Well, it's cool.  It makes a bad movie good, though.  That's true.  Because then you just sit there and look for continuity errors.  It gives you something to do.  What was the movie with Glenn Close where she played a lawyer in the courtroom?  Oh.  I forgot the name of it.  Maybe if someone has it, they can pop it on the instant feedback or something.  But in that movie, in the same scene, they screwed up so bad, the color of her suit changes colors.  It goes from, like, I don't know, she's wearing a blue suit.  The next, you know, they cut away to the judge and they go back to her and now it's a brown suit. 
[01:06:30]  They really screwed up in that movie.  I forgot the name of it, though, where she was the lawyer.  Thank you, Dan.  There was one in the U571.  Which I hear is a great movie.  Yeah, I saw it.  Really cool.  It's a great movie, huh?  Very good.  Jamie.  Huge film flaw in U-517.  I don't know if it's a flaw, but if you look in the first part, they got brand new canvases on the trucks.  The guys are wearing brand new dungarees.  I mean, I was in the Marine Corps and everything is dirty and has oil stains on it. 
[01:07:00]  And it really took a lot away from the movie for me as far as the realism goes.  That's kind of a rough one, though.  Yeah.  Might have been just new stuff day on the base.  There he goes.  All right, let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  Real good.  I was just going to my favorite film club.  Yeah.  In the movie The Wedding Singer, there's this scene where Adam Sandler's psycho girlfriend is wearing a Van Halen T-shirt.  And he says, take it off before you change the band and they break up. 
[01:07:30]  In the opening part of the movie, it says that it's like the late summer or early fall of 1985.  And Van Halen broke up in April of 1985.  Wow, that's good.  Yeah, that's pushing it.  Yeah, well, that's the, I mean, people get real picky with their film clubs on these websites, so.  Yeah.  Thank you.  They're just my favorite fan.  I thought I'd add a little fun to the show today.  All right.  Well, thank you, John.  Syndication underground, gentlemen.  It's happening all over the place. 
[01:08:00]  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys?  Twister, Twister, they're driving the Red Dodge pickup in one scene and you see the mileage and then later on you see it and the mileage is less.  Yeah.  Oh, we picked up on that one.  Yeah, and that movie with Glenn Close was Jagged Edge.  Oh, thank you, Jagged Edge, yes.  You got it, guys.  All right, man.  Here's a couple.  Arlington Road.  Tim Robbins gets into a car and the steering wheel's on the right side, gets out, and the steering wheel's on the left side.  And Goodfellas, this is a tricky one.  The airport scene, the time is 1963, and they have a 747 landing at the airport, and they didn't fly until 69. 
[01:08:30]  That's kind of cool.  Let's see.  Oh, the classics have some interesting film flubs.  In Ben-Hur, in the chariot scene, some car drives across the chute in the distance.  Come on.  I've read these film flub books and, like, you know, some of those period pieces from, you know, the Ben-Hur era.  Spartacus.  Spartacus and all that.  Some of the, like, soldiers, the extras, they have, like, watches on stuff. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, they're wearing wristwatches.  Or, like, you look up in the sky and you can tell that a plane, you know, flew by.  A little contrail from an airplane or something.  And a lot of the westerns and stuff, you can see, like, tire tracks.  Yeah.  Where the crew had to get out there with the equipment and stuff.  But that's getting really picky.  But there are people out there, I mean, they study every film that comes out,  and they're proud of themselves when they find a really interesting one, and they put it on these websites.  Joe Pesci leaning on a 65 Impala when it was supposed to be 1963. 
[01:09:30]  See, that's getting real picky.  You've got to know your cars for that.  Yeah, you do.  Nick, what's going on?  What's up?  You guys ever seen Fight Club?  Of course.  You haven't got the cigarette burns.  Uh-oh, you're breaking up.  You're breaking up, Nick.  Try again.  Oh, no.  Oh, wait, you're back now.  Okay, a film flub in Fight Club.  Yeah.  You know the cigarette burns when they tell you to change the reels in the movie theater?  Yeah.  They talk about them in there.  Now, every single movie I ever watch, I see them.  And it messes me up.  Takes me out of the movie. 
[01:10:00]  Kills me.  Wait, what is that again?  That's when the projectionist has to change projector, change reels?  Yeah, in the top right corner of the screen, you see a little tiny cigarette burn?  A little circle kind of thing.  And it tells them to change the reels?  And now every movie I go to, I see this thing.  And it takes you right out of the movie, huh?  It kills me.  Cool.  I just have to drink another beer.  All right, Nick.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, you're next on NEW.  What's happening, fellas?  How are you?  I got a good one from The Godfather. 
[01:10:30]  In the first Godfather movie, when Don Vito dies on his grave at the cemetery, it says  he was born in April.  For the second movie, they switched it to December when Pearl Harbor got bombed.  Remember that scene at the end of the movie?  Wow.  That's being very observant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very good.  Indication on the pants.  Yeah, the Star Wars one.  When Luke lands at the end and runs to Princess Leia, she yells Luke and he yells back Carrie  for Carrie Fisher instead of saying Leia. 
[01:11:00]  They kept that in the movie?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, it's me.  Yeah, you, Mike.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  In Pulp Fiction, when they're sitting at the table, Tim Roth and Samuel Jackson, remember  when he's pointing a gun at them and he's saying he's having a bad day and all that stuff?  Yeah.  He's going, well, Mr. Nine Millimeter here says that whatever.  You know, he's putting a Colt .45 at him.  Anybody who knows anything about guns is like, ah, what a joke.  Total flub.  Very good, Mike.  Thank you.  All righty.  How about this one?  Oh, boy, can we even say this one? 
[01:11:30]  It's a film flub.  It's in a movie that's out there.  In private parts, Howard goes to fill up his gas tank and the nozzle has an environmental  seal to avoid spillage of the fumes and they didn't have those at the time he was supposed  to be driving his car.  There you go.  Not the only inaccuracy.  Come on.  Barry, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Two good film flubs for you. 
[01:12:00]  One's in clear and present danger.  There's a casino outside of, I think it was the Capitol building, and one of the main reporters  is holding up a mini tape recorder without a cassette inside of it.  And then there was another one in Batman where they're destroying the art gallery and they're  putting fingerprints all over one of the paintings and then the next scene they go back to the  painting and it's totally fine again.  I'm just not interested.  Oh, no. 
[01:12:30]  Okay.  I was reading an instant feedback.  No, I'm interested.  Yeah, we just weren't paying attention to your phone call, sir.  But it got out there.  Well, thank you very much.  Thank you, Barry.  Also, just to let you know, I want to give a shout because my car, I'm a silver blazer  on L.I.E., and I just threw up like three wow stickers from Ranch One today.  Oh, cool.  So I'm keeping an eye out.  Hopefully, I'll see a couple of fun bags on my face today.  Hey, good luck to you, man.  Thank you very much.  Have a good one.  You too, buddy.  Syndication.  Forget about it.  Forget about it.  Thank you, man. 
[01:13:00]  And I got one on the websites.  I was trying to, that's when I was distracted.  I was reading an instant feedback from Jeff.  Opening at the best site for this film flood thing is www.knitpickers.com.  Ah.  Knitpickers.com.  If you want to read about other film floods.  But it makes watching some of these kind of average movies fun, you know?  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we can move on.  Yeah.  I mean, we want to get into broad bingo next, right, Anthony? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Are the cards almost ready?  No.  All right.  The broad bingo cards are done.  Who's playing today?  I'm playing.  Ant's playing.  Rick's playing.  Keith the cop, you want to play?  Sure.  How many cards we got?  We got four so far.  We got four?  All right.  Want to do Anthony?  And Anthony from Vital Transportation?  Sure.  Throw him a ball.  Get him in here.  All right.  Ladies, we need you to call with your bra sizes, please.  We got one lady on hold.  Missy.  Everyone else should hang up so the ladies can get through on the phone lines. 
[01:14:00]  Are we going to ever address the Rick thing?  Yeah.  Are we going to address that today?  Yeah, we will.  I'm just wondering if we're ever going to address the Rick thing today.  Look, Rick's shaking his head.  No.  Well, there's some awkward silence.  Yeah.  We'll address it in some way or another.  Yeah.  Paul the pilot, what's going on? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, I'm over here now.  You're over here now.  I'm getting ready to go, guys.  Is this really going to happen, or are you just pulling our leg?  Well, you look outside a quarter after five, and you tell me.  All right.  And where will we see this mom in the sky?  I'm probably going to try and pull it off twice.  Probably once up towards the south side and once towards the George Washington Bridge.  So pretty much around Central Park, though, you'll be able to see it if you look up?  Oh, yeah.  You'll be able to see it all over New York, and you should be able to see it on the east  side of Jersey.  All right.  I'll believe it when I see it, Paul. 
[01:15:00]  Okay, guys.  But if you pull this off, you're my new hero.  Where are you now?  The airport?  Yeah, I'm at the Sussex airport.  All right.  Well, get in the air before it's too late, all right?  Okay.  I'll see you guys in about 45.  All right, man.  Thank you.  There he goes.  Paul is heading up into the sky to write mom, Anthony, all over New York.  Hopefully.  We're going to need some eyewitnesses out there.  If you see it, please give us a call.  I will lose my ass if this happens today.  I want to totally believe him.  Okay, ladies, call up with your bra sizes. 
[01:15:30]  We're just about ready to play bra bingo.  We've got to take a break.  Anthony getting lots of calls today for Stephen Lynch songs.  Yeah.  Seems like other radio stations are playing the Stephen Lynch songs that were recorded  on our show.  That's pretty much a no-no.  Recorded here live.  Recorded here live on our show.  Because I don't think they really exist anywhere else, a lot of these songs.  No, they really don't.  There are a few that are on his CD, but not a few of these that you've been hearing out  and about there at other radio stations.  So there's going to be a problem. 
[01:16:00]  You can't really play Opie and Anthony stuff on your radio show if it was recorded on our show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Somebody will be getting a phone call and a punch in the face when I do see him on the sidewalk.  I have not forgotten.  You're angry, man.  That's funny.  Come on.  I'm angry.  You're angry all the time.  I'm not angry.  I'm finally sticking up for myself.  I've had it.  My whole life, people have stepped all over me. 
[01:16:30]  I've had it.  He's a lunatic.  No, I'm a lunatic.  You heard the promo, right?  Yeah.  No, I heard it in the car.  You're out of your mind, man.  Where is that?  Before we play the Steven Lin song, now I've got to play that again.  Shut up!  No, you've got to play the promo.  Oh, yeah.  This is Jimmy, who works really hard behind the scenes for the radio show.  He put this little piece together.  And I must say, I sound like a raving lunatic, Anthony.  Yeah.  Our listeners are so quick and with it.  Steven.  Or whoever your name is.  All right. 
[01:17:00]  Steve?  Yeah, well, yes, you.  You just spoke.  Go ahead.  Talk.  You.  Yeah, me.  Yeah, what's your name?  Steven.  Well, what?  You fucking asshole.  Oh, my God.  Son of a bitch.  All these videos.  All I want to do is do this.  How stupid do you have to be to be on the phone and someone calls your name and you don't answer?  All I want to do is do this. 
[01:17:30]  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  You.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Father.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Did he just lose his effing mind?  I'll hope he adds Anthony.  I hate people that don't dare.  God damn, does that piss me off.  I'm a freak of litter thing. 
[01:18:00]  You are.  1027 WNEW.  That's Opie, man.  That's no lie.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor.  Wow, I hear somebody was playing Stephen Lynch just a little while ago.  Oh, really?  A song recorded here.  And Pedro from Elizabeth, New Jersey says,  and you can actually hear you guys laughing in the background. 
[01:18:30]  Hey, look, we're syndicated.  Across the street.  Across the street.  That's funny.  That's pretty pathetic when you've got to play our material to try to get an audience.  That's true.  You can't beat us.  All right, well, if I play their stuff, then Opie and Anthony people will listen to me, right?  I don't think they're really over here.  They're over here now.  Anthony, here's Stephen Lynch recorded on our lovely radio show that everyone seems to like these days. 
[01:19:00]  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It's a simple little ditty called,  What if the guy from the Smashing Pumpkins lost his car keys?  Where the f*** are my car keys?  They were right here in my hand.  I had them just a second ago. 
[01:19:30]  Did I leave them in the kitchen?  Or underneath the cushions of the couch?  I can't find them anywhere.  Any...  Oh, here they are.  Opie.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of cussies.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, Rockaway Bedding.  I love my Rockaway Bedding bed.

A bunch of ladies, though.  You guys are really funny and stuff.  But you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  It's a mile.  1027-WLW.  Yes, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday with your pals, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:22:00]  Hello.  I hope you guys have the WOW on the car for the ride home.  The WOW season has begun.  And we're hearing from lots and lots of people.  It is happening as we speak.  Thanks to all the ladies that are participating in WOW today.  It's only going to get bigger as we get the brand new WOW stickers out there.  And when people realize that this actually works.  Right, Anthony?  Absolutely.  All right.  We've got a lot of ladies standing by to play broad bingo.  A great little game we've invented, Anthony. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  One of the many games we've invented.  It's just like bingo, only fun.  What's up, Rick?  Someone heard about the broad bingo when she came running down here.  She wanted to be the first broad side.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What's your little gift?  What's the problem?  She wants to be the first broad side on the bingo card.  All right.  Well, wait.  Let me explain the game first.  Is she outside?  Yes.  Are you messing with us?  No.  You know how we feel about it. 
[01:23:00]  I missed his birthday on Thursday, didn't I?  I missed his birthday the other day.  Tell me that hot blonde from 20 minutes ago.  That's coming in here and getting naked.  Love me.  Nice.  I'm pulling out my junk.  Oh, you've got to see.  Your junk.  Johnson City, Iowa.  I'm going to mess with the yambag.  Johnson City, she's from?  No, I'm just saying.  Oh.  You're going to be pulling out your Johnson...  I was going to say that would be a bit of a coincidence.  In Johnson City.  Anthony, why don't you explain broad bingo?  Well, you can play along at home.  You make a bingo card.  You know, they're five across, five up and down. 
[01:23:30]  A little square grid.  Everyone's seen bingo cards before.  And you fill in all the spaces with various random bra sizes.  Don't put all the common sizes in a row.  You pick them out of a hat and put them in randomly.  The middle square is the free boob spot.  When your card's complete, we then go to the phones.  We take calls from ladies who give us their bra size.  And you check them off as they come up on your card.  And when you get either five in a row, five up and down, or five diagonally, 
[01:24:00]  you win.  And you scream out, bra bingo.  Bra bingo.  And you win nothing.  Just the honor of winning bra bingo.  Well, but the lady that gives us the winning size,  Will gives an O&A prize package.  Playing the game today, Ant and I, Keith the Cop,  Anthony from Vital Transportation, I think.  Prompt season here, Anthony.  Yeah.  How's that?  Would you like to give a plug?  No.  Not at all.  You sure?  You did what you did to me last time, last week?  No, I don't think I can do anything. 
[01:24:30]  Anthony, can we put some friggin' little lipstick case cameras in your limos for prom season?  Absolutely.  I want to get some little prom queen legs akimbo shots.  Oh, without a doubt.  Wouldn't that be great?  We need some MPEGs.  Yeah.  I'll do it.  That'd be great.  We've got 350 cars that are putting you guys on every day now.  All right.  Very cool.  Nice.  Well, Anthony, we're just a-holes on the phone.  Oh, no.  You're a-holes in the studio, too.  I've been dealing with you for two years.  Tell him.  Tell him. 
[01:25:00]  We're going to make good.  Prom season here.  Yeah.  Why don't you give out the phone number?  No, I have somebody else that will give you out the phone number.  Hold on a minute.  Where is she?  Wow, he's getting smart.  He is getting smart.  I get good at this game now.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Say hello to Shannon.  This is the girl that won the March contest.  I recognize you.  I've seen you naked.  You have?  Really?  Yeah, the girls of O&A.  There she is right here.  Let me see.  What magazine is that?  I have some presents for you.  Hey, what magazine is that?

Oh, there you go.  Look at that.  Showing us her balloon knot.  That's nice.  Mom must be proud.  Look at that.  And she gets her fingers in there.

They run a contest once a month.  The girls of O&A and a lot of girls all over the country at this point are sending in their  pictures.  And then our listeners vote who's the hottest girl of the month.  And then Anthony, like, gives him something, I think.  Yeah, she's going to Vegas.  Going to Vegas.  Very good.  And would you like to check out Shannon?  Yes, please.  Let me take a look.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Which page, Opie?

[01:27:30]  Ooh, yeah.  I didn't put you in the upper deck like I did Opie for the playoffs.  I'll let me hit the end of it.  Thank you.  By the looks of things, they look like they're box seats, Anthony.  Yeah, box seats.  But then again, I'm not a comic.  Opie, what do you got on you?  I got something for you somewhere.  She's got something for you somewhere.  All right, turn around.  There can't be anything over there.  Okay.  Nothing back there?  All right.

Go ahead.  718.  How'd you like to move my law? 
[01:31:30]  Huh?  All right, we'll let Shannon do it.  Okay, Shannon.  718-472-2800.  There we go.  There we go.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Yeah.  Yeah, Dr. Smith has a question for you.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  I love them.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Oh, man.  This is so intense. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, dear.  Yeah.  Indeed.  Oh, dear.  Why don't we have...  A lot of people pissed off if we don't put the spaz cam on the thing.  Is that available?  We're taking still pictures at the worst that we could send off to Steve, you know, during  the show.  All right.  You don't mind?  Where the hell is Columbo?  Yeah, that's top priority for our boys out there.  She wants to give out our website?  Can I?  If you'd like to show us your balloon nut, you can.

Right.  Yes, you guys.  Wow.  Clean as a whistle.  Always.  Oh, my God.  Rob Faw will do anything, man.  Wow.  Just like the old days.  We have seen the primary target for the wax melting. 
[01:33:00]  You got a sealer shot?  Yes, okay.  We're the home of candles.  Screw Rob Bingo.  All right.  Do we want to take a few calls here for Rob Bingo as we wait for the candles?  Yeah, let's do that.  Okay.  We've got the game rolling here.  All right.  We already took Shannon's 36D, if you're playing along at home.  Yeah, play along at home.  Let's go to Jessica.  Hi, Jessica.  Hey, what's up?  Well, we're playing Rob Bingo.  How are you today?  I'm doing all right, but I'm getting a little ticked off besides the Rob Bingo. 
[01:33:30]  Why?  Because I'm walking up the streets of Lodi trying to look for wow stickers,  and no one's out here with wow stickers.  Oh, my God.  See?  I'm practically walking the streets.  I'm on the streets.  There's free boobage out there for the taking.  And let me tell the lady something.  You only wow cars that have the wow on them.  I'm getting honks, but I'm not getting any stickers.  All right.  Well, woof.  That's not good.  That's not good at all.  Well, they've got to be distributed.  Yeah.  And we're still trying to get the word out there and getting the stickers out there.  So give it a couple weeks, but it'll be good. 
[01:34:00]  It's really only opening day today.  All right.  Jessica, what size boobs do you have?  The average size, 34B.  34B.  There it is.  That doesn't help me out with the last one.  That helps me out a lot.  34B.  Thank you, Jessica.  No problem.  All right.  There she goes, Jessica.  Bye.  Pissed off.  She can't find wow signs anywhere, Anthony.  Let's go to Kristen.  Kristen, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing?  Real good.  I have the same, 34B. 
[01:34:30]  Oh.  I'm sorry.  Someone beat you, too.  Common size.  Those perky little B-cups.  Are you going to be wowing this wow season?  I haven't seen anybody.  I saw somebody once, like, one morning, but I was just out of it.  I was like, I couldn't do this.  All right.  That's okay.  You don't have to, but if you'd like to join us with the wow, that would be cool.  Thank you for playing Broad Bingo.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  Let's go to Amory.  Amory.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up?  Not much.  How are you doing?  Great.  Good.  We're waiting for your bra size. 
[01:35:00]  We need a bra size.  34D.  34D.  That's a nice size.  34D.  Thank you.  Can I get something in a row here?  Jesus.  34D.  I don't have...  I get very competitive.  I don't have 34D.  You got three in a row already?  34C.  I don't have...  Who's got three in a row?  Rick does.  Well, Rick, you're cheating.  How can I cheat?  Because you made the cards up.  How do I know what girls...  Yeah, I don't have 34D on my card.  He's got that free boob section.  Yeah, the free boob spot might eliminate one. 
[01:35:30]  How could I not have 34D on my card?  Oh, well.  That's okay.  Yeah, because when you pick that many in a hat and pull them out, there's one extra.  So it'll be different, a little different for everybody's card.  And, Emery, you're going to help us out with the wow this season?  Absolutely.  All right.  Have you seen any wow signs yet?  I haven't.  There you go.  Another lady that has not seen wow signs and willing to wow.  That's just D-cup.  Thank you, Emery.  Thank you.  Okay.  She can't find a wow.  Let's go to Melissa.  Melissa, what's going on?  Hi.  How are you doing?  Great.  Where are you calling us from?  I'm in Stony Brook right now. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, cool.  I suppose.  They're on the island.  We love Long Island.  I love you guys.  Oh, cool.  Are you going to be wowing this season?  When I see the sticker, without a doubt.  All right.  Good.  Well, guys, get the damn wow in your car.  Who are you kidding?  All right, Melissa, what's your bra size?  What do you got?  I am a size 36C.  36C.  36C.  36C.  All right.  Let me see.  36C.  36C.  Oh, that's very good for me.  Well, I'm glad I could be of service to you.  All right.  That helps.  Thank you, Melissa.  No problem.  I'll talk to you later.  All right. 
[01:36:30]  Bye.  Watch Rick.  Bye.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not trusting Rick very much.  I got two to go.  Two to go?  Two to go?  Anyone else?  Yeah, he's got two to go.  Rick's got two to go.  I'm crushed.  I'm done already.  All right, listen.  I'm all over the board.  Listen, Ann, that's a start.  We do have to take a break.  Damn it.  We'll finish the game of broad bingo next.  We're also going to drip hot wax over Shannon's really hot body here, Anthony.  Nice.  Okay, and we'll do that next.  Are we going to set up the spaz cam real fast?  Is Columbo here?  All right, we'll try to get the spaz cam up in time for this. 
[01:37:00]  If not, we're taking digital pictures for the underground website, all right?  Yeah.  All right.  Stay there.  Anthony.  You think I'm going to go in the air and make a complete baboon of myself?  Anthony.  My tampon is sitting a little askew today.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.

When you're working, muscles are a little sore.  I've been working on my body, and you were saying that you were whatever.  You have to go back to the beginning of the show to get that one, but it sounds like you 
[01:39:30]  did too many reps last night, Anthony.  Your tongue is a little tired today.  All I'm telling you is call 1-888-MSPRING.  Yes, of course.  Tell them Opie and Anthony sent you along, and they'll hook you up.  You'd be happier using MindSpring.  Okay.  Shannon, next.  Stay there.  Gentlemen, start your wacky.  Are you mashing me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, it just makes me tangle.  Ah, yes.  Lots going on in the studio, Anthony.  We're ready to drip hot wax on Shannon, but they're getting the spaz cam together.  They're getting the microphone set up.  So, obviously, we can't do this until everything's set, because we want the listeners to check  out what we're doing today, right?  Absolutely.  All right.  So, they need just a few more minutes, and we'll be doing that.  We can take a few more calls for our broad bingo game, Anthony. 
[01:40:30]  All right.  Oh, wait.  Someone saw Paul take off, the pilot that's attempting to write mom, wink, wink, nudge,  nudge, in the sky all over New York City today.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How's it going?  Good.  You saw Paul, the pilot, take off?  He just took off.  He left here about three minutes ago.  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  It was a red and yellow X-200, and I tell you what, followed by him with a bit special biplane.  Oh, yeah?  They took off out of here, blew a little victory smoke, and up and away they went.  Goddamn. 
[01:41:00]  I tell you what, man.  I hope he pulls this off.  Yeah.  I guess within 15, he's going to need at least a half hour at this point, right?  I think it'll take him about a half an hour to get up the river there.  Yeah.  All right.  So in about a half hour, we should see some skywriting over New York City that you're not  going to believe.  We should start getting reports in.  Yeah.  If you guys see anything, please give us a call.  But it's going to take at least another half hour.  We'll see if we can pull this one off today.  Thank you, Mike.  Hey, syndication how?  It's syndication underground.  It's happening.  There you go, man.  You just need to know where to look. 
[01:41:30]  Thank you, Mike.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Let's get back to Bra Bingo as they set up the spaz cam.  Should be set up in a few minutes here.  Elizabeth, what's going on?  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  Real good.  We're in the middle of playing Bra Bingo.  I know.  That's why I'm calling.  All right.  Are you on the highway right now?  Yeah.  I'm on my car phone.  Have you seen any wow signs?  No, I haven't.  I have one in my car, though.  Yes?  Actually, yeah.  And you'll be flashing...  If I can do it while driving, sure.  Yeah.  You're going to be flashing cars if you see the wow sign.  Absolutely.  Guys, what are you waiting for?  What are you, nuts? 
[01:42:00]  What are you, stupid?  Get your wow sticker or get a homemade wow sign on your car.  Unbelievable.  Shannon, what were you going to say over there?  I say wow all the time, especially truck drivers.  There you go.  Thank you, Shannon.  Elizabeth, where are you?  I'm in my car.  I'm headed to work.  Okay.  I was just asking what highway, but that's okay.  I'm in, uh, no, I'm by the Bronx River Parkway.  All right, that's fine.  Uh, all right, well, what's your bra size?  36C.  36C.  We have that one already.  Yes.  But that's okay.  Oh, sorry.  You can never have enough 36Cs. 
[01:42:30]  Is it a nice, firm 36C?  It certainly is.  What type of fruit would you say or vegetable it most resembles?  Um, let's see.  I think.  Cantaloupes?  That's always good.  Smaller cantaloupes.  Cantaloupes are the best boobs, aren't they?  Yes.  I think, Shannon, can I see yours again?  I think, I think they're cantaloupes.  Let me see those.  Cantaloupes?  More like honeydew melon.  Honeydew melon.  I'll say honeydew melon, which are a little more oblong.  I don't think mine is that big. 
[01:43:00]  Shannon, you're hotter in person, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  I've seen your pictures on the internet.  I thought you were hot, but you're even hotter in person.  Thank you.  Okay.  Elizabeth.  Yeah.  Thanks for calling me.  All right, thank you, guys.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Once hopes she sees Balloon Knot.  He's so suave, isn't he?  It's all over.  What do you say to a girl that you saw her Balloon Knot within five minutes of meeting  her?  Missy, what's up?  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you guys doing?  Great.  We're having fun today.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yeah, I know.  And there's just no Whip-Em-Out in all of New Jersey. 
[01:43:30]  Not good.  It's opening day.  It's very, very sad.  Don't worry.  Opening day.  It's going to get to the point where you're just going to see wows all over the place.  Yeah.  I mean, I was ready, brawn, clips, and all, and nothing.  Yeah, see.  Who isn't putting a wow on that vehicle?  I don't know.  Could you just find me?  You just put the wow on it and see what happens.  Missy is ready to wow us.  She doesn't see any wow stickers.  All right.  Well, you can help us out with bra bingo today.  I sure can.  All right.  What's your bra size?  I'm a 34C.  30, 40.  34C?  Hold on.  Where's my corner? 
[01:44:00]  Oh, corner square.  All right.  All right.  Now I'm feeling a little better about myself.  I need two, but oh, my God.  This chick is going to have to look like the hunchback.  Baby got back.  I'm glad I helped you out.  Well, yes, Missy.  Thank you.  You're so welcome, guys.  Keep up the great work.  Are they shapely?  They're very shapely.  What kind of, what type of bra do you wear?  What type of a bra?  I wear a miracle bra usually, but I take the pads out because I don't like to look padded.  I just like because they're pretty. 
[01:44:30]  They're very leafy.  You like a miracle bra thing without the pad.  Yeah, because I like the leaf.  Very feminine.  You wear those wonder bras?  Yeah, the voice sounds feminine.  Well, I try to be.  Being that I am a woman.  You know why they call it the wonder bra?  No, why?  Because after the guy takes it.  Daddy.  All right, Missy.  Thank you.  No problem.  Bye, guys.  I'll create a comment.  Well, I don't even know.  Are we allowed to say that word?  I don't know.  Some days we are.  Some days we're not.  I need to call the burial to call. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  They call it the wonder bra because when you take the bra off, you wonder where her boobs went.  Right.  Just in case they don't die.  Okay.  Let's go to Jackie.  Hey, Jackie, what's going on?  Oh, hi.  I went to play bra bingo.  Oh, I love the cute little voice.  Oh, this could be good.  Thank you.  From her voice, I might have another circled number here.  From your voice, I'm going to guess 32A.  Oh, no.  Sounds like she's got little boobskies.  No, not at all.  Like the olives. 
[01:45:30]  You're all wrong.  34D.  34D.  We have that already.  We do have that.  Oh, you do?  But you can never have enough.  What do they look like?  What type of fruit?  Cassavas?  I don't know.  Cassava melon?  That's pretty good.  Cassava melon?  Very nice.  You've got to get off the helium, honey.  I always sound like this.  All right.  Well, thanks for playing, Jackie.  Well, thank you.  Have a good one.  You, too.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Stephanie. 
[01:46:00]  Hi, Stephanie.  Hey, how are you doing?  Pretty good.  How are you?  Okay.  Where are you?  Brooklyn Flatbush and no wild signs.  Flatbush, is that where you live or a personal problem?  I don't know.  Flatbush is very nice.  I'm over here now.  And no wow signs.  Look what we're finding out today, Anthony.  All these girls worried about no wow signs in sight.  All right.  We've got to give it some time, though.  Stephanie?  Yes?  36C?  36C.  Well, you have that one already. 
[01:46:30]  You have that one already as well.  That's a very common size.  Yes, it is.  Shannon.  Oh, no.  Shannon gave us the 36C.  Yes.  Well, thank you, Stephanie.  Okay.  Bye.  What's wrong with the kid?  Who the hell knows?  Hungry for those 36Cs, man.  Maybe.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  Amy?  Amy?  Yes?  Where are you?  I'm on Route 35 in New Jersey.  And you haven't seen wow signs either?  No, not at all.  Look at this, Anthony.  Look at this.  We give this present to our listeners. 
[01:47:00]  They don't take it and run with it.  It's very early.  I just keep saying that.  Okay.  And you would wow if you saw a wow sign?  Of course.  There you go.  Guys?  I have guys that live across the street from me that sit on their front porch in the middle  of the summer with a huge cardboard wow sign, Jessica Pierce.  That's cool.  You want to look at the mice.  Well, Amy, what type of boobs do you have?  36B.  36B?  Yep, B.  Oh, B.  B, sorry.  36B's?  36B.  I got it.  They're lovely, but it doesn't help me. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, man.  That helps me out a lot.  I need some fatties to call it.  Well, thank you, Amy.  Thanks.  Hey, I got a quick thing for you.  Yeah.  Another radio station's using your OK Terrific.  OK Terrific.  I know.  A lot of radio stations trying to get us to talk about them.  You know, we just can't do it.  Yeah, they were doing a commercial for their morning radio show, and right at the end  they said, OK Terrific.  Yeah, that's great.  That's lovely.  That'll get you.  Thank you, Amy.  Shane.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now. 
[01:48:00]  Status on this fast cam?  It's up and running.  All right.  Thank you, Scott Colombo.  Nice.  Shannon looks very ready.  Yeah.  Should we halt?  Wait till you see this.  Should we halt the game or try to get a win?  Well, how many do you need, Rick?  I only need two.  Yeah, well, so do I.  I need two.  I need the hunchback of Notre Dame with mosquito bites.  Me too.  Or I need a stick.  I need a cassava melon.  I need a flatso to cough.  A flatso?  Yeah.  Like Rosie O'Donnell. 
[01:48:30]  A flatso.  She's a typical example of a flatso.  A big fat woman who doesn't even have the good luck to have big boobs.  Right.  At least if someone's big and fat and they got big boobs, it's like, well, she's got big  boobs.  They're a flatso.  Why don't you get Shannon in front of the spaz cam because I'm sure the listeners are freaking  out.  Oh, it's right here.  She is.  Don't move too.  Oh, there we go.  Don't move too much.  Don't move the camera around too much.  And don't move, Shannon.  We'll get a nice shot on you.  So let me see.  It'll update.  Get updated in seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. 
[01:49:00]  Two.  There she is.  Very nice.  Now you guys get to check out what we're checking out.  Barbara, how are you?  Hi.  Hey.  Well, I'm going to have a second house.  Yes.  Thirty-six double B.  Thirty-six double B.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Look at that.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  I get thirty-six double B.  Double B.  Uh-huh. 
[01:49:30]  Are you happy with your large boobs?  My husband is.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Oh, you're very naughty.  And yes.  And the only wow sticker I've seen in Brooklyn is on my husband's car.  See, look at this.  And you would wow, right?  Anytime.  There you go.  Well, Barbara, thanks for playing broad bingo today.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, glad to go by.  This is our cat.  We're conflicting sound effects over here.  I know.  We need signals to make.  We've got to coordinate our sound effects.  I need one more of them. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  I need two still.  Stacy, what's going on?  All right.  I got some honeydew for you.  Oh, yes.  Come on, Stacy.  48D.  Oh, 48D?  48D?  That's off the chart.  Well, yeah.  Are you sure they're not double D?  Wait.  Can I get double Ds?  Double D?  No, it doesn't count.  All right, boy.  48D.  48D.  Yeah.  Nice.  Wow.  48D.  Wait a minute.  When it's that time, did they swell a little bit and make them double? 
[01:50:30]  Who could tell?  Who could tell?  Well, if you check now, I win.  What do they look like?  Honeydews.  Honeydews.  Honeydews.  Human heads.  Honeydews that have been left out in the sun too long?  No, large, white, and smooth.  Oh.  Hey, Shannon, your hair is covering some nip.  It's getting reports from the audience.  Well, thank you, Stacy. 
[01:51:00]  Uh-huh.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Laura.  Laura, you're next on N-E-W.  We're playing broad bingo today.  Hi.  Hi, Laura.  Hey.  42 double D.  42 double D?  Yeah.  Wow, that's huge.  Jesus, man.  I thought they were huge until I heard the 48D.  42 double D.  No.  Your boobs are bigger than hers, though.  Yeah.  Yes.  Usually it's a double D, D.  You know, it depends.  What do they look like when you have your shirt off?  Um, I don't know. 
[01:51:30]  You want me to give a fruit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, fruit or vegetable.  Fruit or vegetable.  Um, I would say some kind of, uh, oblong melon.  Some type of oblong melon.  Well, that could be anything from, uh, like a honeydew, which would be nice, or a squash,  which would be disgusting.  No, no, we're not.  No, we're not looking at the squash.  I would say we're looking somewhere around the honeydew.  No, definitely not squash.  All right.  And you're, uh, prepared to show these puppies out there on the, on the road if you see a 
[01:52:00]  wow sign?  Oh, sure.  Absolutely.  All right.  No wow sign.  But I can't write over Central Park right now, so I'm waiting for this, uh, this, uh,  skywriting pass.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it, but supposedly there's a guy that's going to be skywriting  mom, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, in the sky all over New York City today.  Well, I'm at the museum.  I'm going to be here all night, so I'm going to check it out every couple, every 15 minutes.  I'm going to come out and see if it's out there.  I'll call you if I see it.  Uh, it should happen within the next, uh, 20 minutes.  Okay.  Thank you, Laura.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Let's go to Christine.  Christine, what's going on? 
[01:52:30]  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  We're playing bra bingo.  What's going on?  All right.  I got a 36C.  36C?  Come on.  Yeah.  If, uh, if there are ladies on the line that, uh, you know, their bra size has been called  already, you've got to hang up because we want to try to move on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm not saying, Christine, that you're a 36C sucker or anything.  Oh, no.  They don't believe me.  To tell you the truth, whoever's screening the calls, uh, should have these written down in front of  them and ask the girl beforehand and, and not put the call through them.  Right.  Is it that difficult? 
[01:53:00]  Right.  I, I, I don't know.  Christine, thank you.  No problem.  Okay.  Bye.  I thought maybe.  Let's go to Michelle.  Michelle, how are you today?  Hi.  You want to play bra bingo?  Yeah.  Sounds like you're in, on the highway.  Yes, I am.  I'm 35 too.  Have you seen any wow signs?  Unfortunately not, but I have one on my car.  Yeah.  Sounds like, it seems like more girls have the wow in their cars than guys.  Hey, I don't mind getting loud.  Lesbo, very chic, Opie.  Got a rainbow sticker too? 
[01:53:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  Lesbo chic.  I'm married.  I'm married.  What's her name?  It's a guy.  Oh.  All right.  Well, what's your bra size?  44 double dates.  Yeah, I got that.  Oh, wow.  I got that too.  Damn, but I am all over the board here.  I'm getting crushed.  That's a nice size, Michelle.  Well, my husband likes them.  Yes, I think we all like them.  Well, look at my car.  It's random as liver spots.  Well, they're all over the place.  I need some order here. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, Michelle, thanks for playing Broad Bingo.  You're welcome.  Anthony, I'm one away.  Me too.  One away.  Without saying it, let me see what size you need.  All right.  Take a look.  All right.  Where is it?  Nicole, what's going on?  Yeah.  Not much.  How are you guys?  Okay, that's viable.  Yes, I could definitely win this game.  Nicole, do you have big boots?  Um, 38 C.  Oh.  Oh.  That was so close.  38 C.  Where is the rest of them? 
[01:54:30]  I don't have a 38 C.  Yeah, Rick, you guys are losing nasty numbers, man.  I got 38 C.  You have an unlisted boot size.  Oh, I do?  No, I got your 38 C's right here.  Okay.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Oh, 38 C.  Oh, okay.  We both need the same one now, though.  Oh, we do?  This could be a tie?  Yeah.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  Well, Nicole, thanks for playing.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  I need the same thing, too.  These are the lamest ass cards ever, because I'll tell you something.  Whoever made this card up...  Rick, did you make these cards up? 
[01:55:00]  Yes, I did.  Well, it's...  What's wrong with the cards?  It's all done right under me.  All of a sudden, it could be a three-way tie if this size comes in.  You all have the same number.  That's just the luck of the draw, right?  It shouldn't work out like that, though.  You need more.  You need, let's see, 5'10", 15, 20, 20...  More doubles.  We have 24 bra sizes that are all mixed up on everyone's card.  We should have, like, 40 or so mixed up randomly on each other's card.  You know, we should have...  I know we've got a lot of people that program.  Make a computer program that spits them out randomly and pricks these things out. 
[01:55:30]  It's an easy program.  Ezzy, what's up?  Hello.  Hi, Ezzy.  Hi.  Do you want to play broad bingo?  Yes.  Okay.  Is Ezzy a lezzy?  No.  I bet you hear that all the time.  No, I don't.  Is Ezzy 15?  No, I'm 19.  19.  I know I sound like a kid, right?  Yeah.  You're a fine African woman, aren't you?  No, I'm not African.  I'm Hispanic.  Yeah, I can hear the Hispanic, you know.  I'll bring the bell. 
[01:56:00]  A19, where are you calling from?  I'm from LeBronx.  A19.  You are?  All right.  I'm assuming there's no wow signs in the Bronx.  No.  No.  No.  All right.  They have those steel reserve signs, though.  All right.  What's your bra size?  32A.  What?  32A.  I wasn't expecting a small size from a fine woman like yourself.  You don't know if I'm fine.  It's Olive Gale.  Will blow me down, too.  Give me a member. 
[01:56:30]  32A.  All right.  Well, thank you for playing.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  What?  That's like, they're like, insane.  Ah, Vicki, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I hope I can make somebody stay really good with my bra size.  You got a big set there?  Oh.  Yeah.  I got a 34 double D.  Oh.  34 double D.  34 double D.  And they look like honeydew melons, only in the car.  They're really perky.  Wow.  Yes.  All right, Vicki.  Thanks for playing Broad Bingo.  Thank you.  All right. 
[01:57:00]  We got a Psycho Marcus.  Get that Psycho Marcus on the line.  Psycho Mark.  Dude, I was just looking up in the sky, and there's a wow being written in the sky.  You're lying.  Wow is over the law in Manhattan.  I'm getting out.  It's like, I have 20 people standing right here.  We just all saw him.  He drew the W.  And he put two nipples on either end of the W.  How the hell does he do that?  Dude, he's an amazing pilot.  I can't believe it.  He's doing more right now as I speak.  He's right above Midtown as I speak.  I can see him circling around making a big, what is it, a goddamn zero. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, that's a question.  I'm getting the wow is over lower Manhattan.  I work in the World Trade Center.  Rich P. checking in right now.  He's right now, he's starting the W.  And he's just about over, I'd say, about 59th Street.  Oh, we can see, god damn.  I'm sorry, right there.  And over there.  Yeah, I'd love to be able to sit there.  See if you can see out that window there.  Everyone's looking up on the street.  Everyone's like, oh my God. 
[01:58:00]  Get the hell out of here.  I've got to crawl out.  Yeah, Ann's crawling out into the crawl space.  Oh my God.  That's so cool.  I should crawl out there and wow everyone.  Yeah, you can go out there and wow the office park across the way.  Ann, can you see anything?  Wow, there's buildings in the way.  Yeah, there's buildings in the way.  Mark, does it obviously say wow or what?  It says wow so obviously it's not even funny.  Get out of here.  That's right.  At the bottom of the W, he put two little nips. 
[01:58:30]  It's unbelievable.  He's making the W right now as I speak.  So just head look up in the sky.  He's got a couple already, so he's going to probably keep doing them all day.  You can probably see it from our office or Jeremy's office.  I hope people are taking pictures.  Yeah, you guys got to take pictures for the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Right here, right here.  Wow, wow.  So Mark, wow clear as day in the sky.  Clear as day.  I miss it.  I'm trying to get a better look at it right now. 
[01:59:00]  That rocks, man.  The ultimate wow sign.  That rocks.  Mark?  There it is.  Hey, they've got an O and A.  He's making an O and A.  He's making an O and A, I swear.  He's practicing.  That's our new best friend, Paul the pilot.  He's making the A right now.  Get out of here.  He's got the O, he's got the Porsche, and he's doing the one side of the A right now.  Get your line.  Goddamn, that is great.  See, we can't see, and so we have to take your word for it, man. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, it's floating right over the East River as I speak right now.  He's probably over third or fourth F.  And it says wow and then O and A on the bottom there?  Yeah.  It's fading out quick, but he's definitely getting them done.  That kicks ass.  That rocks.  We have an Air Force.  I love it.  Oh, remember, Paul the pilot said he was going to do two of them, and the second one's going  to be right by us, by Central Park.  Yeah, he's going to try to do another one if he can get away with it. 
[02:00:00]  Psycho Mark, call back if you see him doing another one.  What's that?  Call back if you see him doing another one.  Very good.  All right, thank you.  We have pulled off the impossible today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Wow in the sky, courtesy of Paul the pilot.  Steve, line three checking in.  Yeah, let's see what Steve has to say.  Yo, guys.  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm up here on the George Washington Bridge, and I can see it clear as day.  And it says wow and then O and A on the bottom?  Wow, and he was working on the O and A last night, but I've got to look over my shoulder 
[02:00:30]  too much to check it out right now.  I'm headed out to Jersey, so I don't want to kill myself, you know what I mean?  That rocks.  Anyway, man, it's out of control.  Talk to you later.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, bye-bye.  All right, that does rock.  Let's get back to Broad Bingo.  We're still trying to get a win here.  Jennifer, what's going on?  What's up?  How are you?  Good, how are you?  You're not playing by the rules.  Why?  What's your name?  Jennifer.  No, no, no.  No, no, no. 
[02:01:00]  You're not playing by the rules.  Pick a new name.  Jennifer is a name that doesn't exist on the O and A show.  Maria.  Okay, Maria.  Hi, Maria.  How are you today?  How are you doing?  Good.  Look, Spaz just typed in Maria.  Oh, it's not Spaz.  It's stinking.  Maria, would you like to play Broad Bingo?  Yes.  Are you an Italian lady with a name like Maria?  No, I'm Greek.  Wow, that's interesting. 
[02:01:30]  All right, Maria?  Usually Greeks take it there.  Not give it.  Maria, what's your bra size?  38 double F.  Oh, what?  What?  30, 38 double F?  Yeah.  Double F.  What the hell does that look like?  A freak shirt.  It's huge, huh?  Yeah.  Has anyone ever seen your face?  Yeah, but it's hard. 
[02:02:00]  Huh?  It's hard.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  Guys, I tried to wow today, but I had my goddaughter in the car, so I couldn't.  A lot of guys were honking.  Don't try to wow while you're driving with those.  You got a built-in airbag, at least.  Yeah.  Front side.  All right.  Well, thank you, Maria, and please wow for everyone out there, right?  I will.  All right, thank you.  There she goes, Maria.  The lovely Maria.  Yes.  People are calling up like crazy, saying that they saw the wow in the sky. 
[02:02:30]  Nice.  Kathy, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  Okay, I'm a 40D.  A 40D.  I can use your 40Ds.  I got that.  We're getting close again.  Where are you calling from?  Long Island City.  Hey, thank you.  Thanks for playing.  Okay, and we have no stickers out here, but there's a U-Haul truck right outside my window.  Is it 14 inches?  Yes, what are those?  A little 14-inch U-Haul.  Spaz is going to be outside tomorrow, so I can get some stickers.  Spaz will be outside the building tomorrow getting abused for five bucks a pop. 
[02:03:00]  But I don't want to abuse him.  I just want to give him 20 bucks and a bottle of wine as a housewarming gift for the hotel.  That's fine.  There you go.  Okay.  That's fine.  You can just watch tomorrow, then.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  Thank you, Kathy.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, what's going on?  Oh, hey.  How are you?  This pilot is out of his frigging mind right now.  What is he doing now?  He just wrote A plus O in the sky.  I'm standing in the middle of Central Park.  I'm in, like, 96th Street.  He's writing it again, because I think there's too much weight. 
[02:03:30]  So he's writing WOW O and A again?  Well, first he wrote WOW, and then he wrote A plus A, but he wrote it backwards.  So if you look down from the ground, it actually says A plus O.  That's fine, too.  That's so big.  It looks like a Jesus Christ.  And these people are standing here with a digital camera taking pictures of this thing.  Oh, cool.  We need to take this.  I'm going to talk on this cell phone.  I've got people looking at me giving me the craziest looks.  If you look for intro to this, come up to me.  What is this WOW thing?  That's awesome.  So I'm taking more pictures, and I'm going to send them in. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, please do.  I'll send them to Steve.  All right.  Cool, man.  If you're going to send your camera, just walk to the station.  Okay, I'll do that if I can.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  It's indication that you're very possible.  That's right.  You're right.  It's like a virus, man.  It's just taking over.  Oh, it's spreading.  Spreading like a virus all over the place.  Kim, what's going on?  Not much.  How are you doing, guys?  Great.  Are you ready?  Yeah, we're ready.  All right.  I got a firm 38D.  Oh, yeah.  I knew I'd make you happy.  Yeah. 
[02:04:30]  I got a winner.  Oh, man.  Oh, we got it.  With a 38D.  Yeah.  Kim, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Anyone want to check my bra sizes?  You have to do that at the end of the game.  Let me see.  All right.  Verified.  Across, Anthony, I got the 36D.  36D.  Okay.  34B.  44DD.  36B.  And the lovely and talented Kim on the line right now with her fine 38Ds to give me the win. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  Very much more firm and firm.  You run fair and square.  They're very firm.  Very firm.  I can flex them.  You can flex them.  Yeah.  We'd like to see that.  How about that?  How about that is right.  Well, Kim, hold on the line for giving us the winning bra size.  We're going to give you some stuff.  Oh, fantastic.  Thank you.  You'll have your choice at wrestling tickets and other stuff we've got laying around the joint.  Nice.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Hold on the line.  And Kim, thanks for playing bra bingo.  Anytime.  There she goes, everyone.  Kim, line four, get some stuff. 
[02:05:30]  Hot wax is ready.  The hot wax is ready.  We've got Shannon in the studio.  She's absolutely beautiful.  36 C's?  C's.  C's.  That's right.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  Steve from Staten Island checking and saying, Paul, the pilot skywriting is totally visible  from Staten Island.  Get out of here.  That rocks.  Oh.  That rules, man.  We are taking over this city.  We got wow in the sky today.  How mental is that? 
[02:06:00]  Oh, my God.  I love it.  Now we need a wow written in the side of, like, the World Trade Center at night.  Empire State Building.  Or Empire State Building.  That's our next goal, Anthony.  And a couple of reports like this, too.  The giant wow was being taped by the Chopper 4 live on Channel 4 News.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They probably said, wow, what a beautiful day.  You know, like, they have no clue what it means.  Boy, that would be the ultimate wowing on a live news shot, huh? 
[02:06:30]  Hold on.  The phones are just going nuts now.  Allen, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Great.  I'm just coming out of Long Island out here, and I'm on the Belt Parkway.  Yeah.  And I can see that guy writing in the sky.  Those letters are huge.  Where are you on the Belt?  I'm on the Belt going into Brooklyn right now.  I just come past JFK.  Oh, my God.  You can see those letters all the way out here.  Everybody's looking.  Wow.  JFK, Staten Island.  This is like Turk 182, Anthony.  Those letters are huge.  Obscure reference, bud. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  Well, thank you, Allen.  Okay, guys.  I'll see you later.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Let's go to Neil.  Neil, you're next on N.E.W.  Hello.  Neil, what's up?  What's going on?  How are you?  We're on the West Side Highway just before the bridge.  They're making a wow sign right now right above us.  I love this guy.  It's everywhere.  You can see him from all over the city.  We've got reports from Central Park, Staten Island, around JFK, West Side Highway.  You can see it from anywhere. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, we're at the 158th Street exit right here.  We've got wow signs all over the van.  I know women.  Thank you, Neil.  All right.  All right, man.  You're breaking up, Neil.  You're breaking up.  Matt Devote in the studio.  The boss and I were just hanging over his desk.  We could see it at 57th Street Side.  This is O&A in the sky.  This is O&A?  Yeah.  Which desk?  Ken's.  Oh, Ken's from Ken's office?  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Oh, we've got to.  Yeah, let's take a break and see if we can see anything.  Mark, what's going on?  Real fast.  Hey, O&A?  Yeah.  You guys got to give that guy some credit. 
[02:08:00]  That's my home airport.  They do a wild air show.  These guys normally do skywriting like six planes in a line.  This guy's doing aerobatic.  Get yourself up there.  This guy sounds good.  Yeah, you got to give that guy some credit.  Plug their air show or something.  These guys are good.  I'll plug whatever that guy wants at this point.  He's rolling that plane pretty hard to make letters.  Oh, wow.  Gary, check it in.  Thank you, Mark.  He's in Jersey, and he can see it perfectly.  All right.  Jimmy from Long Island. 
[02:08:30]  You can see it from the LIE, Jimmy.  Yeah, this thing is huge.  I was on Grand Avenue.  I was listening to you guys.  I'm like, no way.  Yeah.  I turn around, and I see I just caught him writing the O, and I thought maybe he was writing  loud, but he was writing O plus A.  That way it was huge.  Cool.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Later.  Bye.  Fort Lee, New Jersey, checking in.  See you.  Clear as day.  O and A.  Wow.  This is unbelievable. 
[02:09:00]  This guy's our new hero.  The next road show, he's going to get the biggest, hugest applause ever.  Channel 4 just showed an aerial shot live in NYC, and there is a huge wow.  Laura, what's going on?  I told you I'd be here, and I see him doing it.  I saw him start it.  I can't believe he's doing it.  So Central Park West, you can see the wow?  Central Park West, I'm telling you, I mean, he's humongous.  I don't know how you couldn't see it.  He's doing it.  It's humongous.  All right.  Very cool.  All right.  Bye.  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to run down the hall.  We've got to check it out for ourselves. 
[02:09:30]  We've got to take kind of a long break here, because we're really late, but if you stick  around, we've got Shannon with her fine, huge 36D.  She's on the spaz cam as we speak.  We're going to be tripping hot wax all over her body, Anthony.  Fun, fun, fun.  Yes, lots and lots of fun to be had by everyone today.  What?  All your bosses are sitting on the windows looking out.  All right, cool.  We've got to take a quick break.  We've got to check this out for ourselves.  We'll be back as soon as possible.  Stay there.  Get ready for food.  Get food with the mouth of the mouth of the day. 
[02:10:00]  With O'Reilly and Anthony.  N-E-W.  Gelfi and Anthony Show.  I think that might be part of the problem with society tonight.  Oh, I believe we're the problem.  Gelfi, you stupid bitch.  Check out now.  1-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  I believe I'm not faring too well in the promos that are being made lately, Anthony.  Well, Opie, I think it's showing your maniacal size.  And I believe it's very accurate, to tell you the truth. 
[02:10:30]  You're a kook.  I think I'm an even-tempered soul.  You're a nut job.  This is what you are.  You're a douche.  Well, Anthony, the phone's going nuts here.  We just did the impossible today.  Well, we had nothing to do with it, all the pilot.  He said he was going to do it, and he got it up in the sky.  A big, huge wow over New York City.  That kicks ass.  Bunch of people running pictures over to the radio show.  They had Polaroid cameras. 
[02:11:00]  And the letters have to be, what, 100 feet tall?  I don't know.  They're huge.  They're absolutely huge.  And they say this guy is one skilled pilot,  because the winds aloft must be pretty high, you know?  And pretty fast winds.  So by the time he was finishing the O, part of it was already kind of fading.  So he had to get the rest of it done real quick.  And he's doing all these aerobatic maneuvers to do this.  I'd love to see this guy fly.  He wants to take me up in that airplane. 
[02:11:30]  I know.  I'm a little old.  I don't know about that.  Not sure, huh?  A couple of beers.  All right, let's talk about the Knicks for the next hour.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Just kidding.  Wow reports coming in from everywhere.  Yeah, let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  Gentlemen, you rock.  You've done the undoable.  Yeah, I think so.  We had nothing to do.  The skies are ours.  The skies, we have taken over the skies. 
[02:12:00]  I'm up in the northeast Bronx.  You can see it from up here.  Really?  And as far as there being no wows in the Bronx, you can verify with Rick or Psycho Mark.  They saw me when they were handing out the stickers the other day.  Oh, cool.  I got an eight-foot wow on the back of my truck, man.  Thank you, Chris, for supporting the wow and the Opie and Anthony show.  You guys have done it all.  All right, man.  Thank you.  You know, I got to tell you, Opie, in any battle, the high ground is the treasured position. 
[02:12:30]  We have just taken the high ground.  Yes, we have.  The skies above Manhattan.  We need a wow sign on the Statue of Liberty.  We need some of those Greenpeace wackos to hang a huge wow banner off the 59th Street Bridge.  And, of course, the ultimate goal for this program is to get some type of wow in space.  I want a wow sticker on the space shuttle.  Anything's possible at this point.  They got that big bay on the back, right, that they keep the satellites in. 
[02:13:00]  What would it be for someone to slap a goddamn bumper sticker back there  So when they launch the satellite, you can see a wow in space.  I'm thinking wow on the moon, a big wow.  Wow on the moon.  A big wow flag.  Let's go to Mike, who's in Westbury.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  I just wanted to tell you guys, you can see it from Westbury.  I'm standing on top of my office building.  Man.  Like three, four, nine.  From Westbury.  It's huge, bro.  I know.  We saw, like, the traces of it at the end when we went to the commercial. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All right, well.  Yeah, I just wanted to say you guys are the best, man.  I listen to you every day.  You make my drive home great, bro.  Hey, thank you.  And I want to come in with, like, two cases of Heineken's on the ice, bro.  Well, any time.  We love beer.  I hear you, man.  All right.  Bye.  All right, take care, bud.  Ant, this just in.  Sitting on the Great Wall of China.  Wow is clear as day.  Hey, Mike, you're next on NAW.  Mikey.  Yo, what's up?  I'm up in the Maranac. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  And I'm working.  I'm at a customer's property in the backyard right in the water, and you can see it.  No problem up in Westchester.  No Maranac.  Now, is the guy done with the skywriting?  Is he out of there now?  I'm assuming he's done, huh?  He's done his job, and he's...  It's kind of blown away now.  I was there about 15 minutes ago.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Mike.  Hey, F syndication.  I can already hear you guys.  All right, cool.  I like that.  What the hell?  I'm very selfish.  We're not going to change the show when we do get syndicated one of these days, even  though syndication underground is moving along quite nicely. 
[02:14:30]  Well, Anthony, you get the point.  Everyone's calling from all over the place.  Yeah.  They saw Paul, the pilot.  I know.  Greenwich, Connecticut checking in.  Jersey, Yonkers, Teaneck, East Brunswick.  Girls wowing now everywhere.  Virus.  Yeah, that's true.  Now every girl has seen a wow sign, so I mean...  Yeah, there you go.  Now you don't have an excuse.  And Paul, the pilot, as soon as he lands, I believe he'll be calling the radio show, 
[02:15:00]  and we'll all have to give him one big hell of an applause.  That guy is invited up.  He'll be calling with one phone call.  I'll pick him up by...  Listen.  Nah.  I'll pick him up by limo, okay?  That's...  Oh.  I'll pick him up by limo.  We're going there, bring him into the studio.  Well, thank you, Paul.  Frank, Tom, John.  You're an ass.  The guy gives you cars whenever you want.  Cars.  Beautiful women coming in, taking their clothes off.  How many other girls have been in here and have no problem showing you full balloon knot like that? 
[02:15:30]  Two years.  And Mets tickets.  I got Mets tickets.  I get to see McGuire.  And you're asking his name.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  I know.  I'm sorry.  You do it up for fun.  You know something?  You should at least let him plug Vital Transportation.  Yeah.  Prompt season right around the corner.  Let her rip.  Let her rip.  You do it. 
[02:16:00]  Vital Transportation.  What's the matter?  I'm so stupid.  Ed, you're so stupid.  That old gag.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for that phone number, Jerry.  Thank you.  Sam.  Thank you, asswipe.  Okay.  Thank you, Pete.  Pete.  That's Sam Donaldson.  Jimmy.  Lou.  Jonathan.  Whatever.  Okay, great.  All right, there, Bill. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  What do you say, Mike?  You know what?  Ed, I'll get him.  Swamp lip.  I haven't had the swamp lip in a while.  There's a picture of my animals.  Shut up.  Nice picture.  Your limo company sucks.  Eat me.  Would it be asking too much to have a driver that speaks English?  Oh, man.  That's it.  Wow.  What?  I thought we were all just having fun.  What happened?  You are a dick.  All right, Anthony, what I was trying to say is we're trying to get this contest together, 
[02:17:00]  the craziest thing you would do for the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  And we're trying to get an amazing prize.  Yeah.  Like, I'm serious, an amazing prize.  Paul wins.  Possibly a vehicle or something.  This is the type of stuff we're looking for, though.  Paul, skywriting wow over New York City today.  Who the hell is going to beat that?  If you want to try, go for it.  Yeah.  That's huge.  All right, Anthony, let's pour some hot wax on Shannon.  Yeah.  What the hell are we waiting for?  Come on.  I'm not going to forget Shannon.  Shannon, who won the Girls of O&A last month? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, March.  March?  Oh, two months ago.  Yeah, she did.  Wow.  Yeah, her picture is up on foundrymusic.com.  Beautiful.  Or if you want to check her out right now, cybervixenbabes.com.  Cybervixenbabes.com.  I'm waiting for the spaz cam to update over here.  You do that so well.  When it comes to me, you stutter.  Watch.  Hot girl with her boobs out. 
[02:18:00]  I know her name, Shannon, and the plug is cybervixenbabes.com.  There you go.  Overweight limo guy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, dang.  Bald-headed bastard.  Let's see.  Can't remember the plug.  Sorry.  Your mic's not even on, idiot.  Now we just turned your mic completely off.  No, we got the mic. 
[02:18:30]  You unplugged it.  We unplugged your mic.  You're unplugged.  All right.  The mics are set for us outside, Anthony.  We're going to drip hot wax on Shannon.  Is the spaz cam ready out there?  Yeah.  They're setting that up.  Anthony, as we switch to our other location here.  Yes.  Yes, Opie.  Why don't we play that shut up promo?  Yeah, I love this one.  Jimmy did an unbelievable job with this.  Excuse me.  He works very hard behind the scenes.  You don't get to hear his voice much on the air, but he takes a lot of the stuff we say 
[02:19:00]  and he turns it into promos.  Yeah.  So as we move to the field mics, check this out.  I think it'll make you laugh a little bit.  It shows my psycho side, Anthony.  Yes.  Here it is.  We'll be back with Shannon right after this.  One minute.  Our listeners are so quick and with it.  Steven.  Or whoever your name is.  All right.  Steve?  Yeah.  Well, yes, you.  You just spoke.  Go ahead.  Talk.  You.  Yeah, me.  Yes, you.  What's your name?  Steven.  Well, what?  You fucking asshole. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Son of a bitch.  Oh, he's very upset.  How stupid do you have to be to be on the phone and someone calls your name and you don't  answer?  All I want to do is to be shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You fucking asshole.  Shut up. 
[02:20:00]  You fucking asshole.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Did he just lose his effing mind?  No.  I hate people that don't care.  God damn.  Does that piss me off?  I'm a freaking idiot.  You are.  1027.  WNEW.  Tell me what you want me to do.  You're a human deity. 
[02:20:30]  Whip him up Wednesday.  This is going to be what?  Lupus Gigantus.  That's against the law.  It should be.  I'll be an entity.  Whip him up Wednesday.  I just love being naked.  Oh, yeah.  N-E-W.  Wow.  Yeah.  Heyo.  Hey, Ed.  How are you, man?  Ah, great.  We're outside the studio now.  We're in what used to be called the imaginary ballroom.  Now it's the my balls are turning blue room.  And just like the imaginary PD we had, it's no longer the imaginary ballroom. 
[02:21:00]  No, no.  Anthony, I got the famous candle.  Yes.  We'll use this one other time.  This is one of our favorite new games.  We're always coming up with new games on the ONA show.  Let's drip hot wax.  Wait, we have a lot of people out here.  Why don't we make some noise for Shannon?  Everyone.  Yeah.  These guys are never around when we're doing a boring radio show, Anthony.  You notice that?  Rick trying to set up the spaz cam.  Yeah, so if you're making sure it's good.  Yeah, if you're trying to check this out on the spaz cam, give us a minute or two. 
[02:21:30]  Wow, Rick's really good at this, though, man.  I think Kevin would always hold it, and you'd get Picasso pictures over the goddamn computer.  Wow.  That's terrible.  That's a hot shot.  All right.  And we're taking still pictures for the unofficial website, so if you're in your car,  you'll be able to check this out when you get home.  All right.  And how are we going to do this?  Are we going to climb up on these chairs, I guess?  Well, no, we could just stand and do that.  I like going from way above, though, man.  Do you?  Yeah.  What does she do?  She's got to lose the clothes, though.  Yeah, lose all your clothes. 
[02:22:00]  Just get friggin' naked.  Shannon from some website, I forgot.  You could ask nicely, Rick.  Cyber Vixen.  You're like a goddamn porn director.  Cyber Vixen Babes.  Cyber Vixen Babes.com.  Yeah.  All of it?  All of it.  Oh, the whole schmear.  What, you got a mohawk down there?  Can we aim for the mohawk?  Last of Mohegan.  Who's going to pull it?  Who's going to pull it?  Let's sing.  All right.  Oh, that's a mohawk, all right.  Wow, that sure is. 
[02:22:30]  That's mohawk bordering on Hitler's mustache.  All right, now, Shannon, you can't move around a lot because people will scream.  They're checking this at home through the spaz cam.  Feel free to shriek in pain.  Yeah, we want to hear.  Rick, if you would like me, please.  Anthony's candle is lit.  There we go.  And are we playing any games today?  Well, we'll do the usual.  You take the right boob, I'll take the left boob for the bullseye.  Okay.  Let me build up a nice little pool of wax here.  We're building up some wax. 
[02:23:00]  We've got some field mics.  Oh!  Yeah, Opie's going to fall off the chair and break his goddamn neck.  All right.  I like going very high.  All right, Rick, let us know when the spaz cam is set up.  Now, shield your face.  Yeah, shield your face.  Stinky's holding the...  Stinky, put your junk in her face.  No.  There we go.  Put your...  Nice view.  That's good.  Okay.  Here we go.  Let's go.  Oh! 
[02:23:30]  Hey, where's my wax?  Oh, I'm dripping off on her hand.  Oh, there we go.  Ed, you missed the target, Ed.  Oh!  Bullseye!  Direct hit.  Direct hit.  Wow.  Oh!  All right.  Yes.  The target was obscured when we first went in.  I saw a break in the clouds, and I hit nip.  Ed, we're building up more wax.  Shannon, how do you feel down there?  Is that good?  Oh, it feels great.  You sure you feel good?  I want more.  You want more?  All right, I'm going to lower my aim.  All right, I'm going for Nagasaki now, which is the belly button. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  No, no, believe me, that's not Nagasaki down there.  I don't know what the hell that is.  That's downtown Tokyo.  Me love you long time.  That's the invasion force.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, right in.  There we go.  I'm using the Norton bomb sight.  Wow, she's used to pain, it seems like.  You like it?  You want a spade shovel?  Psycho Mark, what are you, stupid?  Psycho Mark is trying to get the sound of the wax hitting the body. 
[02:24:30]  Psycho Mark, does it work?  Psycho Mark, get out of the way.  That doesn't work.  Oh, wow.  Get in there.  Look at that.  Boy.  What an idiot.  What are you talking about?  There's some beautiful microphone.  What are you talking about?  Anthony.  Oh, that's really boring.  Oh, yeah, okay.  That's really boring.  Let's get down without, oh, look at that.  Wow, is that going between my legs?  Yeah, I think it is.  Yeah, we're going for, we're going for ground zero.  This is like a, oh, this is like a man in a boat overboard. 
[02:25:00]  Wow, this looks like a car accident.  It's really good.  Oh, right in the crease.  It's a little disturbing.  Oh, my God.  Okay, here we go.  Let's see if we can hit the right spot.  Oh, you want us to go right for it?  Oh, I got it.  I got it.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  How did that feel?  Get a picture.  Oh, that's great. 
[02:25:30]  All right, I'm going to go for the boobs again.  Going for the boobs, Anthony.  All right.  Shield her face.  Whoa.  Get those.  There they go.  All right.  I want to cover mine.  I'm going to try.  This is like the game you play where you've got to shoot out the star.  Remember that at Adventure Lando?  You go down there and you've got to shoot the star.  You've got to totally obliterate the nip area.  You're not left.  You're making me laugh.  My aim's way off now. 
[02:26:00]  That's got to hurt.  The last girl that had this done to her, she was screaming like crazy.  Let's bring out the lead soldiers and try it with molten lead.  All right, turn it over.  Yeah.  Yeah, turn it over.  Gee, I almost forgot about the flip side.  Yes.  All right.  You know what's funny?  She's got very fun.  Oh, my God.  No, don't open it up.  She's got very fine blonde hair on her ass.  That's going to feel really cool when you yank that out.  All right.  She's on her stomach. 
[02:26:30]  The field mic is in place.  You really want us to go for that, huh?  Go ahead.  Oh, Jesus.  I can't do that.  That's a new game.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  We're in the tank.  All right.  Wait.  You can't say that.  You can't say that.  John, dump out of that.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, he's nailing her head.  Oh, my God.  There we go.  Oh, my God.  Wow. 
[02:27:00]  Wow.  That is it.  You got it again.  Balloon not central.  She's squirming around like crazy.  Wow.  Very nice.  I'm expecting the Van Halen record to start any second.  My lips are stuck.  Of course.  Of course.  That means she's speechless, Anthony.  She doesn't know what to say.  It looks like Papa Smurf was going at her back door.  Wow.  What do you think, Shannon?  What do you think?  Woo. 
[02:27:30]  That feels good.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, let's get some on your back.  Okay.  Here we go.  Of course.  Yes.  Oh, that feels good.  Yes.  You look like you've got measles.  We're ready, green measles.  All right.  Well, that was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  She's covered in wax.  Yes.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, I got her good, Anthony.  What do you get?  I did it again.  Yeah, you can't say that. 
[02:28:00]  Look what I did to you again.  I'm over here now.  I'm sorry.  I'm dripping over here now.  You know, instead you should be lighting candles for Jesus.  I almost dropped my candle.  It's going on my kiki.  Okay.  All right.  Very good.  On your what?  All right.  Wow.  My kiki.  On your kiki?  Yes.  Yes.  We all have a kiki, don't we? 
[02:28:30]  All right.  Listen.  Let's hear it for Shannon.  Yeah.  Bravo.  Nice.  Don't move.  Let the people on the spaz cam take the whole thing in, okay?  What's the fun that with the cam?  Yeah, get a close-up of that on the cam.  That's good.  I want to show Mommy my artwork.  Mommy?  Yeah.  That's something you'd be proud to hang up on the fridge at home.  Yes.  Right?  Now it's live.  No, put your candle away, Mark. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  Very good.  Well, Shannon from CyberVixenBades.com.  You like that, Opie, huh?  You're eating good.  Yeah, Opie won't stop.  I blew the candle out and, you know, appreciate what she's saying.  She's so silly, Mark.  Yeah, we better go to spots, Anthony.  Sealed up like an Egyptian tomb.  We're really late, but we want to thank Shannon for coming in.  We've got some great digital pictures we'll send off to Steve.  But, Shannon, did you enjoy your waxing?  Oh, yes. 
[02:29:30]  Pull those off.  Wait.  Don't break that.  We want to sell that.  Oh, look at that.  The nip cover.  Save that.  Save that.  That's hilarious.  That's the one of my kiki.  Oh, Rick.  All right, all right.  Listen.  My kiki.  Anthony, I think we're going to go to break, okay?  Once again, let's hear it for Shannon.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on NW.  We'll be back.  Booze.  The world's universal language.  I use my breasts to get other people's attention.  We'll be an Anthony. 
[02:30:00]  The brain is in their hands.  1-8-2-7-W-A-N-E-Double.  You'll love Paisano.  Yes.  Are we going to do a wax dripping at Paisano?  I don't think so, huh?  Oh, wow.  That was unbelievable.  That was a lot of fun.  You know something?  You're a little too into that Opie.  Just a tad.  You know what I mean?  Well, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  I mean, right in the kiki.  Right in the kiki.  What's wrong with that?  I don't even know what the kiki is.  She's like,  You got me right in my kiki.  Kiki.  Fantastic.  I'm like the pothole guy.  Yeah, you're filling potholes.  That's great.  A little more blacktop over here.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, we are doing a spot for Paisano of Mulberry Street. 
[02:31:00]  You'll love it.  Come on.  Authentic Italian cuisine.  You got great service.  Reasonable prices.  And huge portions.  And don't forget their incredible pasta lunch specials.  You go down there.  Say hi to Joey, the owner.  Tell him you heard about his place from the Opie and Anthony show.  He'll give you a glass of wine on the house.  Yeah, make a reservation when you go down there.  Or you just drop in seven days a week.  Weekends till 2 a.m.  2-2. 
[02:31:30]  Ponderous.  Effin' ponderous.  Effin' ponderous.  Yeah.  So, I'll tell.  Yeah, yeah.  Tell Joey, I'm over here now.  Joey, where's my wine?  I'm over here now.  Yeah, definitely do that to Joey.  We love when we send our listeners in to bust on him.  We did the how you doing for a while.  Now, the new one is, hey, Joey, I'm over here now.  Where's my wine?  You know what's good about I'm over here now?  You could scream it from across the room.  If you're a paisano, you're having a dinner, and you see the owner, Joey, just go, Joey, I'm over here now. 
[02:32:00]  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  There you go.  And he brings you over a glass of wine.  All right?  And if no one's coming over to your table with the wine, I believe you could start screaming the Earl wine, Anthony.  Oh, yes, yes.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me. 
[02:32:30]  Help me.  Help me.  And they'll come running over with that free glass of wine on the house.  Yes.  Unless Joey turns around to you and yells, shut up.  These machines are too much fun.  Yeah.  All right.  Anyway, yes, paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  You guys know we love the place.  We're there a lot.  Now that the warm weather is upon us, I believe the tables will be outside soon.  Yes.  That is always a lot of fun when you get a table outside so you can people watch.  And eat some fine food.  So it's paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. 
[02:33:00]  If you want to make a reservation, give them a call.  965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.  We are going to be an Anthony show.  I like it when this show is dirty.  1027-WNEW.  It's the ONA show.  Whip them out Wednesday happening as we speak. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, what was that?  Paul the pilot accomplished his mission, Anthony.  He called us earlier on in the show and said, hey, guys, I could get wow in the sky.  And we're like, yeah, right.  Whatever, Paul.  Prove it to us.  Yeah.  Well, we've now heard from thousands upon thousands of people.  Everyone saw the wow in the sky, Anthony, over New York City.  Clear as day.  We have conquered the skies with Paul.  He is our Air Force. 
[02:34:00]  Yes, he is.  And Anthony?  Yes.  Paul is on the line.  Yeah.  The pilot.  There he is.  Bravo, Paul.  Bravo.  How do you guys like that?  Oh, my God.  Looks pretty good, huh?  It's hard to do.  Paul.  A lot of people said that there was winds aloft.  Oh, yeah.  We've flown pretty good.  Pretty cold, too, at 10,000 feet.  You don't have a heater in that day?  No.  Paul, a lot of eyewitnesses saying you were making some pretty crazy maneuvers to make that A. 
[02:34:30]  No more than 60 degrees of bank.  Wow.  Yeah, you can't do aerobatics over a populated area at any altitude.  Manhattan is considered a populated area.  Yeah, I think so.  So, Paul, are you going to get in trouble for writing this wow in the sky?  No.  Okay, very good.  It was by the book.  I did it all by the book, legal.  I do this as a living.  Now, that is great, man.  You are the hero of the Obi and Anthony show.  I'll tell you that skywriting is pretty hard.  Aerobatics is a lot easier.  Yeah, I always wondered, how the hell do you know what you're writing? 
[02:35:00]  Like, how do you even know?  What I did today was pretty hard.  At the same altitude, I couldn't see what I was doing.  So, I had to climb up a little bit and look down on the letter and kind of remember where it was and go back in and finish it.  So, you're checking your work as you do it?  Yeah.  You make like a W or a piece of the W. You do one letter and then go up and take a look?  Right.  What do you pull it up?  What kind of climb do you do when you pull it up?  Just 100 feet or two is all you need.  Yeah? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  But it was pretty windy and I hope it looked all right.  It didn't look all right from where I was, but.  Well, everyone knew what the hell it was, that's for sure.  Okay.  Yeah, and I got the O and the A in there, too.  Yeah.  You did.  Yeah, we were getting a lot of reports on that.  You guys, you're like our new hero.  I mean, unbelievable.  The feedback coming in is incredible.  Good.  Everyone saw it.  Everyone.  Good.  Great.  Can we call you Schmuck Yeager?  I don't think so.  No, I didn't think so, either.  So when are you coming in to check out the show? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, I'll be in.  You should have came in today.  We were dripping hot wax all over Shannon.  Oh.  Yeah.  We've got to set something up for you when you come down here.  Okay, not a problem.  Yeah, maybe we'll have you try to write wow on her belly with wax from above.  Well, that sounds like fun.  Hey, maybe we'll get this up for FU Friday.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  I don't think that'll work.  No, I don't think they'd allow that.  No, but any time you want to write wow in the sky, we're game.  Cool.  Or anything else we could think of that would be legal. 
[02:36:30]  That's good.  What kind of restrictions are there with writing?  I don't think there's any as long as you just stay out of everybody's way.  And you can't write, like you couldn't write the F word up there or anything.  You've got to submit everything you're going to write?  No, not actually.  No.  They just asked what I was going to write and I just, you know.  Yeah, mom.  Right.  They probably would have let wow, but I didn't want to take a chance and blow it, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Because once they say no, that's it, you're a done deal.  Right.  No second chances.  Well, Paul, you're the talk of the city today. 
[02:37:00]  Good.  Bravo.  Without a doubt.  Paul writing wow in the sky.  Skywriting today.  I never thought I'd see the day.  How long have you been flying?  20 years.  I started out in hang gliders and ultralights.  Really?  Yeah.  You've got to get Anthony in that plane.  Not a problem.  Anytime.  He's got an open seat.  Jeez.  Just go for it, man.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'll be honest.  I'm a big pussy when it comes to that type of flying.  I know.  Because you do those snap turns on me.  A hammerhead stall or something. 
[02:37:30]  Well, I've given, I've probably given over 200 rides and I've never had anybody get sick  in the airplane.  All right.  I'll be the first.  Cool.  Just remember, if you puke, you've got to clean it up.  Yeah.  All over the canopy.  Oh, yeah.  That's a mess.  Great.  All right, Paul.  Okay, guys.  I'll keep in touch.  Definitely keep in touch.  All right, guys.  No, come down here soon.  I mean, we want to treat you nice after doing something like that for the show.  All right.  Well, maybe sometime next week, early next week, I'll get down there.  All right.  Hold on the line, too, because I don't know if it's going to do it justice, but we're going  to send out a box of stuff for you. 
[02:38:00]  Cool.  Just a ton of things.  So hold on the line.  All right.  All right, guys.  There he goes.  Paul the pilot.  Yeah, bravo.  He did the impossible today, Anthony.  He always wanted something like that to be done.  He wrote a big wow in the sky.  Now, Psycho Mark saw it from his sticker stops.  Dude, it was insane.  Yeah.  People were running around going, my God, look at this guy in the sky right in the wall.  And with the W, right?  Yeah.  He put two little nips on the bottom of the W.  How the hell do you do that? 
[02:38:30]  I don't know, but he's a real pro.  Yeah.  Dude, it was amazing.  Then I saw him do the O&A, like right over Midtown here, about 59th.  He was probably over 3rd Avenue.  And you see a big O&A, you know?  That is fantastic.  It was just, I was screaming.  I'm just sitting there screaming and laughing.  It was just the most amazing thing I've ever seen.  Oh, God.  I see that.  Awesome.  How was the sticker stop today?  Great.  We were able to get there on time.  We got back on time.  We handed out about 1,700 stickers.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah.  If you want to get your wow sticker, you can go to participating Ranch One locations. 
[02:39:00]  They have them.  You just have to ask for them.  Is there a hot commodity so they're behind the counter?  Or send in a self-addressed stamped envelope.  If you do that, you keep her all nice and busy around here.  Hey, send me up in a plane.  I'll bomb people.  Yeah.  Sticker bombs.  Self-addressed stamped envelope to WNEW, 888 7th Avenue, 10th floor, New York, New York,  10106.  And just write attention wow sticker or something on the envelope.  Okay?  A lot of reports.  Also, Channel 4, the news copter, took a shot of it. 
[02:39:30]  Like as they were going into commercials, you know how they usually do that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They probably did some goofy things because they don't know what it is.  They're like, wow, what a beautiful day.  A beautiful day for baseball.  Beautiful day.  Wow.  All right.  Tommy, what's going on?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just Tommy.  Just trying to find out when they're doing their spaz thing tomorrow.  Tomorrow at 4 o'clock outside the building, you got a chance to yell at spaz for $5.  Spaz-a-thon.  It's a spaz-a-thon.  We're trying to raise some money. 
[02:40:00]  I got bills.  I got to pay.  He will be in a Boy Scout uniform.  He will be holding a sign that says, abuse me for $5.  Boy Scout uniform where I achieve eagle rank.  Yeah.  Okay, please.  Okay, cool.  Bring mad signs down there.  All right.  4 o'clock.  All right.  All right, cool.  That's going to be nuts tomorrow.  Yeah.  You can't touch spaz, though.  He takes a lot of abuse on this show.  It's fun enough just screaming at him.  Yeah, it really is.  If you pay a lot of money, we'll give you the bullhorn.  Oh, that's a good one.  A lot of people pissed at the spaz cam, got slammed, and it didn't work. 
[02:40:30]  Well, you know, we can only do so much.  Jim, what's going on?  Tim, I think.  Tim, sorry.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  All right.  All I know is, on the spaz cam, I couldn't see nothing.  All I saw was a microphone and a light.  That's all I saw.  Man, that's not cool.  And I reload, I exited it and redid it again.  I went to the WNEW site.  It was all the same thing the whole time.  Yeah, that's the problem with the Internet, you know?  Well, I got some good shots.  Yeah, every time we turn on that spaz cam, it gets just slammed to the point where it just, 
[02:41:00]  I don't know, it doesn't work that great.  But Rick took some great shots, and he's going to send them off to Steve immediately.  All right, cool.  One more thing.  Killer shots, he's saying.  Killer.  I live up in Westchester.  Yeah.  And I went to a ranch, one in White Plains, and they had the stickers.  I got like 50 of them because I kept going back.  Yeah.  They're all gone.  All my friends were like killing me for them.  Oh, cool.  So I'm saying, if you want, can I come down to the station, maybe pick some up and hand  them out up in Westchester?  You guys can organize it or want me to help out Earl. 
[02:41:30]  Anything to help out WOW and get around.  Well, just do it on your own.  I mean, this thing is spreading like a virus.  Look what Paul did for us today to spread the word of WOW.  I mean, can I come down and pick up some stickers to hand out?  We probably have them at the receptionist, sure.  All right, great.  I'll hand them out all over the place, and I'll call you guys up.  Well, thank you.  All right, man.  I'll be down in my alley.  All right.  We're going up to Westchester to hand out some WOW stickers soon?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  We'll get up there.  Wow.  What a day.  I'm exhausted.  Yeah.  We played broad bingo. 
[02:42:00]  We dripped hot wax all over Shannon.  We had a sky rider in the sky writing WOW.  People WOWing all over the highways and byways.  What are your fish on what?  Started with the Rick situation.  Oh, fish on call.  I want to know how far we can go with this.  Why?  It's kind of, I mean, obviously it's not good for Rick because I won't say anything.  This whole situation isn't good for Rick because he's a little worried, which I, you know, I think that's fine. 
[02:42:30]  What happened?  Let's just, we'll just say something, uh, something happened to a personal possession of Rick's.  Really?  Yeah.  What's the matter, Rick?  Did the cops tell you not to talk about it?  They did?  The cops said not to talk about it?  Did they? 
[02:43:00]  We could talk about it without talking about it.  It's the first time Rick has a live mic and isn't talking.  I know.  He kills for airtime and he doesn't want to talk yet.  You're confusing me with Mark.  Oh.  Well, that is true.  Fight club.  Here we go.  How much of it can we get into?  Because it, you know, if you take you out of the picture, it's kind of a funny story.  Right.  And it would make for good radio.  Dude, come on. 
[02:43:30]  Someone told, uh, Rick a little bit.  I'm not, I'm just saying.  Did you read the paper yesterday, Rick?  Did you get yesterday's paper?  Don't look at me.  Let's just say if, uh, I'm staring at someone involved, there will be a major problem.  I had nothing to do with it.  Don't look at me.  Let's just, let's just say that now, on record, that if I'm staring at someone who was involved, there will be a major. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, boy.  Rick is cursing on the air.  Rick.  I had nothing to do with it.  All right, now it's getting a little intense in here again.  Rick, are you had a good show today, guys?  Come on.  Shannon's like nervous over here.  She's like, oh, my God.  Yeah, Shannon, stay in between, uh, Psycho Mark and Rick.  Yeah, she just wants to plug her website.  Well, that's all right. 
[02:44:30]  Cybervixingbabes.com.  She did a great job for us.  She should get a plug.  But, uh, I have nothing to worry about.  What happened?  Why can't we talk about it?  The police told you don't talk about it.  No.  They didn't say that.  You don't want to talk about it.  Right.  Rick, talk about it without giving details that is, you know, going to screw you over, personally.  I don't like silence.  I'll have to think about it.  It's on Foundry Music, I think.  It's on Foundry Music?  Oh, my God. 
[02:45:00]  That's where I saw it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I know about it.  Oh, my God.  It's on Foundry Music?  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what's going on here.  I'm out of here.  We're out of here.  Why did Rick just leave the studio?  And pissed.  Yeah.  I had nothing to do with this.  That's all I'm saying.  Zero.  Oh, my God.  This better get resolved.  Rick had a little scare.  Let's just put it that way.  Where is he? 
[02:45:30]  He's on the phone.  Oh, he's going to yell at Steve right now.  People think this is...  Oh, no.  It's not on FoundryMusic.com, is it?  Yes, it is.  I saw it there.  That's how we saw it.  Get out of here.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Where is it?  I don't know.  You'll know in a minute.  I'm about to get my ass kicked for something I didn't do.  I got a big leg here, man.  I'm going to get involved.  I haven't seen Rick this pissed in a long time.  Rick is pissed, man. 
[02:46:00]  He is esteeming.  People want to take a guess.  Shannon's like...  Spooky.  Spooky.  What's going on?  Yeah.  How's it going, guys?  Good.  Oh, man.  No.  I'm not going to try and hazard a guess at this, but we could probably have some competition  going between who can figure out what Rick's so upset about and what Spaz is so deep and  dead about.  I don't know.  I don't know what Rick wants to say, because he's really pissed, and there are authorities  involved.  Thank you, Spooky. 
[02:46:30]  Jesus, man.  It'll come out.  Everything comes out on our show.  We got to...  Huh?  He's gone.  He's not around.  Where is he?  He was on the phone five minutes ago.  Now he's gone.  Somebody wants to take Rick on a boat ride.  I don't know what's going on.  Chad's looking at me.  I don't know.  I'm just...  Have a drink.  Rick is frigging pissed, man.  Do you know what's going on?  I don't know if you're going to figure it out.  Oh, I know. 
[02:47:00]  Everyone's like, might as well talk about it.  I agree, but...  Yeah, yeah.  Let's get Rick in here.  We got to get Rick back in.  Because now Psycho Mark is yelling at Rick through another door or something.  What is he doing?  Go find out.  Come on.  Walk.  Maybe if Shannon is completely naked, it'll keep him at Rick calm.  Yeah, really.  He will.  In case of emergency, exposed boobs.  Okay.  He will punch someone.  What's going on?  I just don't think it's on me.  He's...  Where's Rick?  He's disappeared.  Does anyone know where he is?  No. 
[02:47:30]  I think he's in the office.  I think he's out of the office.  Oh, my God.  Well, what happened?  I can't even guess to the Foundry.  His spas was missing.  Everyone is going to Foundry to try to find it out.  I can't even get on it.  But Steve is probably...  Steve is probably on the phone right now with Rick.  And being told to get the pictures off.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Uh...  Who's that?  Billy, what's going on?  Billy.  Hello.  All right.  He's gone. 
[02:48:00]  I think Billy's playing at Rascals tonight, fat guy.  What?  Where is he?  Where did Rick go?  He walked back to the office, Jay.  Yeah?  He walked by me.  He didn't look like he was coming back.  No, he's pissed.  Yeah, he didn't look happy.  Call the office.  Call his line.  I'll call his line.  All right.  Get him on the line.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  Ben, call your phone because he's probably on his.  You get it.  Yeah, let's just say somebody messed with some of his personal possessions. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, man.  At his home.  And left telltale little signs acknowledging that they were familiar with certain things  that have happened on this very program.  That's, you know.  He hung up.  He hung up.  He hung up.  Oh, come on.  What was he now?  Earl?  Why did he hang up?  He said no.  He said no.  Dysfunctional family.  This is a dysfunctional family.  We've had such a great radio show today, and now it's going to end in disaster. 
[02:49:00]  He's busy.  What?  He told us.  Thank you.  He's busy.  He's busy?  Well, this must be a good time to play What's in My Pants with Amy on Line 7.  Professional segment.  Oh, man.  I can't get on Foundry.  Foundry.  All right, you guys.  Honestly, this isn't a radio teaser or anything.  I mean, it'll come out on the radio eventually.  Obviously, Rick is over-the-top pissed.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  I guess it's a very interesting little story, that's for sure.  Yeah.  What?  It is, though.  It's a very interesting little story.  It is.  It's an amazing little story.  Can you give me a hint?  Huh?  I have no idea.  Give me a hint.  Give us a hint.  No, I'm trying to respect Rick and see what he wants to say at this point, at this juncture.  Wow.  What, Ant?  Nothing. 
[02:50:00]  Every time I walk in here, something happens.  Spaz walks out.  Rick walks out.  Rick, I don't know.  Rick should come in here.  And we should talk to him about it.  He can walk.  What was involved?  Fish.  What?  Really?  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that.  Yeah, no, I'm not getting involved.  They kicked me off the air.  It'll be out loud over here again.  This is like we're just throwing out little puzzle pieces and people are going to be all freaked out.  Fish newspaper. 
[02:50:30]  Oh!  That knows.  I saw it on the website.  You know?  I saw it on the website.  Was it really on the website?  Yes!  Oh, wow.  Someone sent pictures.  Someone sent pictures to where?  Hope you might hit two million hits tonight.  I know someone's going to go read.  Horsehead?  Why are you writing this stuff?  Dude, I don't need him beating me up.  I've already taken him on in Fight Club. 
[02:51:00]  It wasn't fun.  Say that.  I don't want to get involved with the real fight because it would be...  He's got to be trying to get a hold of Steve.  Right.  Steve's listening.  Get him back in here somehow or get him on the phone or something because we have to...  You know, we kind of got into this a little bit and I think we've got to elaborate on it.  Show your boobs, Shannon.  There you go.  There you go.  Thank you, Shannon.  Cybervixenbabes.com.  Thank you, Shannon.  There's a little wax left on that one. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, I see that.  Look at that.  All right.  God, we're in a quandary, Anthony.  We're in a quandary.  Yeah.  I mean...  I know he's really pissed.  I know there's authorities involved.  It had something to do with something he owns.  Yeah.  And I swear to you, I had no idea there were pictures on Steve's site.  No.  Until recently.  No.  So what are you trying to say?  Whoever did it took the pictures and sent it in?  I did nothing.  All right.  I'm going on record to say I did nothing.  I happened to look at the site at about, I don't know, what, 2.30, 3 o'clock? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  And the pictures were on there.  Wow.  All I'm going to say.  That's it.  I had nothing to do with it.  I didn't know about it.  He wants you.  Yeah, he thinks...  Because I've got a running battle with him lately?  Yeah.  He thinks maybe you were involved or something.  Oh, yeah.  Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Steve.  Hi, fellas.  What's going on?  Not much.  I just got a little message from Rick. 
[02:52:30]  I received an email this morning containing a few pictures sent in anonymously.  Yeah.  I'm not quite sure how much of this is I'm able to divulge.  Right.  But the pictures contained vandalism, if you will.  Really?  Done to a certain article of Rick's belongings, one of Rick's prized possessions, perhaps.  Okay.  And I was told to contact an individual or page a certain number when they were up on the 
[02:53:00]  site, and that was it.  And then I guess let the sparks fly.  Okay.  And now I'm trying to take them down, and it looks all jammed up.  Yeah, I can't get on your site, man.  I can't either.  Steve, you're going to hit two million hits by the end of the night.  You know that.  Yeah.  The unofficial website is going to hit two million hits.  It's over the last of the year.  Yeah.  It's all jammed up. 
[02:53:30]  I can't even get into taking anything off.  Oh, my God.  Trying.  Wow.  Where is he right now?  Where's Rick?  Probably in his office trying to call me.  This is what he's doing.  He's what?  Who knows?  Say hi.  Oh, Steve.  Steve, Shannon's here.  Hi, Steve.  It's Shannon.  Is he really pissed?  Yeah.  Say that again.  He didn't hear you.  Hi, Steve.  It's Shannon.  I spoke to you on the phone.  Oh, hey, Shannon.  What's up?  Not much.  How are you doing?  I'm good.  I'm sorry.  I missed seeing that today.  No, you're going to get some great pictures soon.  Oh, really?  Yes.  It was fun. 
[02:54:00]  I hope you enjoyed it.  I really enjoyed it.  So, Steve, what else can you tell us?  Well, I don't know.  Is this something that a police report was filed about?  That's what I'm hearing, yes.  Oh, really?  I don't know that.  Let's see.  There was a fish involved.  I know cops were involved.  There was a porcelain horse head involved.  Yeah.  There was a lot of newspaper involved.  Yeah.  Good post.  Perhaps a, I don't know, a large metal yellow item. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  That might have four wheels.  Yeah, don't give too many details about that.  Okay, okay, okay.  That, that, that.  All right.  And a whole lot of newspaper.  Oh, a ransom note, it looked like.  Or maybe not a ransom note, but a note that looked like it might have come from a kidnapper  of sorts.  Hmm.  Yes.  Okay.  You have an annoying laugh, man.  A crafty individual at work here.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  All right.  Um, well, if Rick's listening, because I know he is in the back room, I had nothing to do  with this.  I don't feel like getting beat up today.  I didn't either.  Yeah.  For the record, I just got pictures.  That was it.  All right.  Yeah, neither did I.  I'm just going to go on the record saying that, too.  All right, Steve.  And perhaps a reference to a Godfather movie.  But, uh.  Okay.  Yeah, I saw the pictures when, uh, they were sent here.  Oh, okay.  Me and Opie saw them this morning.  Oh, okay.  Or this afternoon when we got in.  I almost got hit before the show, because I was laughing, because as twisted and demented 
[02:55:30]  as this, this, uh, incident is.  Right.  The pictures were pretty damn funny.  Oh, they were.  I was shocked to see them.  And I'm not going to lie.  So.  The, uh.  The little reply I put was just, oh, my God.  Really?  Rick is going to hit the roof.  But, uh.  Yeah, he has the.  People think I have a temper.  Oh.  Let me tell you something.  I do not.  Glad I'm not in the room right now.  Rick will kill somebody. 
[02:56:00]  Well, the message he just left on my voice show was pretty irate.  Dude, do you have it right there?  Uh, no, I don't actually.  Oh, come on.  Come on, man.  No, I don't.  I, I, I just erased it.  I was trying to say that I erased it.  Oh.  Sorry.  All right.  I would love to hear that.  Rick, if you could send another voicemail to Steve.  Yeah, get in.  Another angry voicemail.  All right, Steve.  Unless you have anything else that, that helps us with the puzzle.  I hope so.  I hope so.  I will try to get them removed.  I don't know how much luck I'm going to have.  It looks like the site's getting hit pretty hard. 
[02:56:30]  All right, man.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  All right.  Take it easy.  I can't believe this went undetected all day long.  Like, we had one call about Phish earlier that I was like, I kind of knew what they were  talking about, but I didn't think they, you know, saw pictures or anything.  Yeah.  Uh, Darren, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Fredo got his payback.  Opie, what'd you do?  I didn't do nothing.  I did not do anything.  Yeah.  Yeah, we weren't involved in this. 
[02:57:00]  We weren't.  If we were involved, we probably would have said something to Rick.  Unlike what he did with Air Sick and Jay Moore.  Right.  We would have told him.  We knew.  What would Rick get more upset about?  A, that this was a joke on him.  B, that people knew about it and didn't tell him. 
[02:57:30]  That's it.  A or B.  What about C?  What's C?  Or C, that it was some random thing that, uh, that he seems to think it is.  Right.  It sounds more like just a joke.  It sounds more like a joke.  Yeah.  I mean, it's a little elaborate for just somebody that may be a fan of the show  to find out where he lives or something and do something like that. 
[02:58:00]  Does he have the fish?  Maybe I can have the forensics guys printed or something.  And, I mean, maybe do a little work on the fish.  Uh, Danny, what's going on?  What's up?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Anthony doesn't sound so innocent on the radio there.  Really?  Yeah, he sounds, uh, I don't know.  I will sound too innocent.  I will swear to anybody I was not involved in this.  All right.  Just to explain it sounds on the radio.  I was absolutely not involved in this.  Took you a while to answer.  That's why.  No, no.  I definitely wasn't involved in this. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  That's what it sounded like.  But I can understand how Rick must feel having a joke played on him where maybe others knew  about it and, uh, you know.  Did not let him in.  And didn't let him in on it.  Right.  And, you know, you come off looking really stupid and feeling like an idiot.  That sounds like you're rubbing something in.  And, and, and you think, uh, you know, you think maybe people that you know are going  to come and, uh, help you out, help you out.  And they don't kind of leave you out to dry.  I'm speculating.  I, I will tell you something right now.  I'm speculating on this, but the, the, from the evidence I've seen, it looks like some 
[02:59:00]  type of joke.  Do you think anybody did it from the, from the staff?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know if you don't.  It doesn't sound malicious.  It sounds just like, you know, administer a lie detector test to the whole staff and whoever.  I'll take it.  I'll take one.  Thank you, Danny.  Later.  Bye.  I'll take one.  Shannon will take one.  Well, and, no, I know Opie had nothing to do with this.  I know Ben didn't. 
[02:59:30]  Psycho Mark.  Me.  Earl.  It's Earl.  It's Earl.  Earl did it.  No, Earl would have gotten lost on the way.  Steve, what's going on?  Uh, yeah.  Well, after I heard all that, I'm pretty convinced it was about the Jay Moore thing.  I just want to say payback is a bitch, whether it's intentional or unintentional.  That's Steve's opinion.  Thank you, Steve.  Of course, they're referring to the fight with Jay Moore and Hairsick Productions, the 
[03:00:00]  fake one that they pulled on us.  Right.  And me and Opie got hung out to dry, looked like idiots.  And, uh, Rick, we found out, knew about the whole thing right from the beginning and didn't  tell us and left, hung us out to dry.  Now, you would think that me and Opie would have had something to do with this, but we  didn't.  Well, you should have.  If that is the case, would we revel in it and kind of get a chuckle?  Yes.  I've got to be completely honest with you.  I think it would be pretty fun. 
[03:00:30]  But did we have anything to do with it?  Absolutely not.  Ab-so-effing-lutely not.  Now, where's Rick?  Rick?  Where is he?  I don't know.  He doesn't want to come back.  He doesn't want to come in.  Uh, Jim, what's going on?  You?  How are you, Jim?  I'm doing all right.  I saw the pictures earlier.  You did see the pictures?  Yeah.  All right.  You want me to describe them?  Uh...  You can't get mad at me.  I'm waiting. 
[03:01:00]  I'd like to know.  I don't know what's going on.  Eh.  What?  Jim asked a question.  No, this is what sucks.  Until Rick gets in here and we get to talk to him about it.  Ben?  I talked to him.  He said he might be coming down.  It seems like he's coming down a little bit.  He's having a beer.  He looks a little more...  That seems to be the cure-all.  He is pissed, but I think he's coming down a little bit.  So I said, are you going to come down?  He said, maybe.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Bye.  I know why he's really pissed because he's in a bad situation now because his wife, 
[03:01:30]  we all know and love dearly, was very, very upset.  Very upset by that.  Extremely upset.  Extremely.  And I would have to say I understand that part of it.  Chris, what's going on?  Chris.  Yo, what's up?  You're on the air.  What's up?  Why is this car wrapped up in newspaper?  Chris. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, we lost the line.  Line 7 hung up.  Hello?  Get Pete to work on line 7.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Chris?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  I'm over here now.  Dice?  All right.  Let's take a break.  Is that you, Dice?  This is better than WWF, I swear.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  Eddie asking if Rick knows Johnny Ola.  I love that. 
[03:02:30]  Ah, sure.  Johnny Ola showed me this place.  Johnny Ola, you said you didn't know Johnny Ola.  Let's see.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, Opie, how are you?  Great.  Listen, I just bought a new car.  I was wondering if you knew if Rick could help me out with the car cover.  Oh, man.  I just needed something inexpensive, not really pay too much money on it.  All right, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  We've got to take a break.  We'll try to get...  This is no bit.  I mean, if Rick wants to come in, he will. 
[03:03:00]  I honestly don't know if he will.  But we have to take a break, Anthony, okay?  Right.  Affirmative.  And if he does come back in the studio, Shannon, you're going to protect me.  I'll protect you.  Okay.  Shannon, pull those boobs out.  Because when there's boobs in the room, there's no fighting.  No, no.  Ever.  No.  You've got to show ass.  Rick loves ass.  Oh, yeah.  He's an ass man.  So that'll calm him down.  Like, when he comes in and he's going to be at that mic, you come over here and you point  your ass over here now toward him. 
[03:03:30]  Over here now.  And this might work, okay?  Over here now.  All right, Ann, let's take a break, okay?  Okay.  We'll be back.  Whip him out Wednesday.  What is that?  Like some kind of guy thing?  Like some kind of sexist guy thing?  Yeah!  You will not get away with this!  I wish you could just shut your big head up there!  It's Whip him out Wednesday!

So, it's 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Anthony's down the hall trying to find Rick.  Yeah, I'm in the office.  What's going on?  He's not in here.  He's not in the office?  No.  There's just a weight of debris from when he came back here, I guess. 
[03:06:30]  You know, like old trophies from the old NEW softball team and stuff?  Yeah.  Broken on the floor.  There's just pieces of stuff all over.  Like, he hit everything on his way back.  Dude, he is so wicked pissed.  Where is he?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  He went to the bathroom where people go to crunch.  Which trophy is this? 
[03:07:00]  Oh, no.  The WNEW All-Stars versus the fire department benefits softball game for the local cerebral palsy chapter.  Oh, it's a gunner.  It's a gunner.  It's a gunner.  What a mess.  Wow.  Yeah, he's pissed.  Yeah.  And he's nowhere in sight.  And now he's nowhere to be found.  Is he hiding in Earl's stairwell?  Someone knock on the private bathroom. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Someone's got to go to the executive washroom.  Tell a limo guy.  All right.  Anthony, you want to go, like, see if he, yeah.  Oh, no.  He can't be taxed.  You know, Anthony.  Rick, get out of there, you F&A hole.  All right.  Oh, my God.  We're not going to resolve this today, obviously.  We're running out of show.  Yeah, I know.  Is he?  I just heard someone say, oh, no.  He's punching walls.  What? 
[03:08:00]  He's punching walls where?  In a battery.  He's punching the walls.  He's punching the walls.  Does someone have a portable?  Let's go.  Am I hearing?  What is that?  I know.  I'm hearing, like, poof, poof, poof.  Dude, what is with him?  He's having a tantrum in the bathroom.  He's freaking out.  Oh, a liquid up Puerto Rican.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  He had a few to try to calm down.  Now he's pissed.  Is he coming out of the bathroom or not? 
[03:08:30]  I don't know.  I heard, like, toilets flushing and banging on the wall.  You know, the wall to our office is right there.  Yeah.  What?  He pulled the freaking back.  Yeah?  Come on, stop it.  Hey, what?  Dude, I think he's destroying the bathroom.  I think he pulled the frigging, like, one of the doors off the stall.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Dude, he's going to frigging unload. 
[03:09:00]  Well, is he coming back from the bathroom?  Uh-oh, Rick's in the office?  Yeah.  All right.  Rick, I'm going to have to go inside and discuss this.  Rick.  You can ride around?  No.  I'm...  Rick.  Not too warm in the air.  He's everything like crazy.  I know.  We had to dump out a lot of...  Uh...  I ran out of delay. 
[03:09:30]  I hope John grabs it down the hall.  He's pissed.  But it's good radio, right?  Dude, he's so pissed.  It's good radio, right?  Uh, I guess.  Oh, my God.  Where is he now?  Now he's mad at the pictures.  Anthony just came in with the bathroom door.  Anthony just walked into our office.  There is the door to one of the toilets in his hand. 
[03:10:00]  Why is Anthony laughing?  Is he numb?  He ripped it off of the wall.  Is Rick right there?  No.  Where is he now?  He's just stormed out.  Right.  He's really pissed that, uh, there were those pictures on the website.  Right.  I...  I honestly did not know that they...  I didn't either.  No clue.  No, you know, anything. 
[03:10:30]  So...  All right, Ant.  Wicked pissed.  All right.  That they would say.  All right.  Yeah, man.  I'll be right in.  All right.  There goes Anthony.  That was an amazing conversation, but there were so many curses.  I'm sure we dumped out of that whole damn thing.  Paul.  The exchange between Anthony and, uh, Rick.  Paul.  Uh, Paul, what's going on?  I got a new nickname for Rick.  Yeah.  Kiki. 
[03:11:00]  Kiki.  Where are you, Kiki?  Don't blow the show.  Kiki.  Get in here, Kiki.  Yeah, Kiki is, uh, well, the girl that came up with the term,  Kiki is, uh, still in the studio, but that's, that's very good, Paul.  Show, show her butt.  Maybe he'll show up in the room.  All right.  Yeah, Rick likes butts, but I, I don't know.  I, he, he's, he, I've known him a long time.  He's very good.  Anthony, bring the door in the room.  They are.  Oh, my God.  Anthony has made it back in the studio, and he, and, uh, Anthony,  the limo driver is holding the bathroom door. 
[03:11:30]  His wife is upset.  Get in the room, Kiki.  He tore it, uh, right off the slump.  Right off the hinges.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  Hey, I'll see you.  Bye.  Get a picture of this for the website.  Wow.  I don't know what he's more pissed at.  Like, what happened, or about the pictures?  He tripped, by the way.  He tripped?  Yeah, he says he tripped.  He tripped into that?  He's getting in trouble for that.  That's what I said.  That's, uh, yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, man.  I can tell he's truly, truly pissed.  Good to see you, Shannon.  Good to see you, man.  Uh, Steve, what's going on?  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  I'm on the queen's throw.  Uh, yeah, Opie, I only got half the payment for Operation Horsehead.  Listen, I had nothing to do with it, man.  I was trying to tell him that, too. 
[03:12:30]  We had nothing to do with this.  He's mad.  Somebody sent me out the plans.  Well, he's mad that it made the air, I guess.  But, I mean, it was on a website.  Yeah, I saw some of the pics on it today.  I was going through the site.  All right, Steve.  Not too pretty.  All right, thank you.  Okay, later, guys.  Bye.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Supposed to be having a little station party right after the show.  That ought to be fun.  That's going to be a little awkward.  We'll print out the instant feedbacks.  I'll read them.  I can't get online for anything.  I can't get on that anymore. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  We're getting slammed.  All the websites are getting slammed.  Instant feedback.  The unofficial Opie and Anthony website's getting slammed.  The spaz cam, everything.  Can't get to anything.  Oh, boy.  He is just so pissed.  Is he coming in or not?  No.  Hell no.  He was back by the copy machine and stuff doing things.  I don't know why.  I don't know why he isn't coming in.  He said he was mostly pissed.  He said, I told you not to bring it up on the air, and he brought it up on the air.  But you know when you see those eyes, like beet red and everything? 
[03:13:30]  I've seen Rick have some freak outs.  Trust me.  That's not fun.  Yeah.  Everyone thinks I'm the psychopath in the show.  Uh-uh.  Mike, what's up?  Anthony, come on.  What?  I want to start with what I learned today.  Yeah.  And go on record.  You know far too much about what's going on.  You knew and let go about things about his wife, knowing already when you just said, oh, what's going on?  Why is Rick all pissed?  Anthony, great one. 
[03:14:00]  Great radio.  And you guys are the best.  And Rick, I know you guys.  I mean, don't give some of your credit to your listeners.  We're not all dumb.  Swear to you.  I had nothing to do with this.  Opie had nothing to do with this.  Nothing to do with it.  Neither did Psycho Mark or Ben.  No one that works here on our show or this station had anything to do with this.  For real, guys?  Come on.  Listen, dude, I come in here all the time.  I don't know if you're going to continue tomorrow. 
[03:14:30]  I know for sure.  Yo, dude, listen.  Rick is far too pissed, and he doesn't want to come in there because he's going to rip your head off.  No, no.  Listen, dude, I come in here all the time.  I don't work for the station.  This is not the thing.  I saw that at 4 a.m. this morning.  Look at Anthony trying to calm him down.  Hey, fellas, great syndication, what the hell.  All right, man.  Later on, guys.  Thank you.  I can't stress enough.  We had nothing to do with this.  Joel, what's going on? 
[03:15:00]  We're trying to wrap up the show here.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  I own a graphic design company in White Plains, and we took the pictures off the site, and  we're looking at them.  Absolute craftsmanship in the way that machine is, the car is wrapped.  It looks like when they did some air conditioning work here, and they used that blue tape for  the duct tape.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's what I did.  Yeah, yeah.  It was really, really good.  I mean, we can even read some of the newspaper on the car right now.  Yeah, yeah.  Believe me, I think I have an alibi. 
[03:15:30]  Well, I don't know.  Thank you, Joel.  Take it easy.  All right.  I wasn't traipsing around duct taping things.  Chuck, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Yo, I think I know who did it.  Huh?  I think it's going to be Spaz.  Why?  There's two dead giveaways.  One, on the ransom note that I'm looking at, the word your should be Y-O-U apostrophe  R-E.  Spaz is an idiot.  He would make a mistake like that.  Well, use your in a sentence. 
[03:16:00]  What?  How is it in a sentence?  It says, you're like our older brother, but don't ever take sides against the family  again.  That's from the Godfather.  Oh, my God.  And then it says it's signed O-N-A Flip Mo Squad.  Well, we don't have a Flip Mo Squad.  I don't have a Flip Mo Squad.  I got a second part to this puzzle.  There's a picture of a fish with a wow sticker right across his body, right on top of the dining 
[03:16:30]  out section of the newspaper.  Spaz might be a little bit upset about his recent credit card thing with his dining out.  All right, Chuck.  You are really looking into things.  Thank you, Chuck.  Okay, guys.  Bye.  Steve from...  Hello, this is O-J.  I just want to say I wasn't even near there at the time.  Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Hi, Steve.  Hi, Steve.  For the record, the pictures are off.  Ah.  Gonzo. 
[03:17:00]  They are no more.  It took about 15, 20 minutes to even get onto the site, but I got them down.  Rick will be very happy to hear that the pictures are not on the site.  Is he really furious?  Oh, is he really furious?  So effing pissed, you cannot even believe it.  We are looking, as we speak, at the door.  Oh.  One of the bathroom stall doors that were ripped off of the hinges.  Oh, good guy.  And to show even more anger, I do believe that is the handicap door.  Meaning that some poor sod in his wheelchair is going to have to take a dump with no door. 
[03:17:30]  Oh.  All right.  Poor Rick.  All right.  Well, I didn't have anything to do with this.  No.  We've stated, and I swear to you, we have nothing to do with this.  I got an anonymous email with a bunch of pictures attached to it this morning.  That was it.  Three to go.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, fellas.  Okay.  All right, guy.  What?  I had something in my throat.  Six.  Rick, buddy, old pal. 
[03:18:00]  Rick.  Rick.  Don't hang up.  Okay.  At least you're on the line.  Dude, honestly, we have to leave.  It's 6.52.  Are we going to be safe walking down to our office?  That's all I need to know right now.  We know you can be crazy.  I want to stress to you that we had nothing to do with this.  That is not why I'm upset.  I understand.  You sound like Earl now. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, for you to watch your ass.  No, didn't his voice sound?  Rick, you know that's a joke.  You sound like Earl right there.  Go ahead, Rick.  Rick, everyone.  We'll give you the last word today.  Rick.  I asked you for a simple thing.  What did I ask you earlier?  Not to talk about it on the air.  Rick, without cursing.  Now, let me ask you something.  If you said don't talk about it on the air because there are certain people involved. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think I did that.  I know.  And certain issues that have to be sorted out.  If you were under the impression that this was done for one reason and other people knew it was done for another, putting it on the air is exposing it for what it is, not for what you think it is.  That's all well and fine.  So now, if it is exposed as a joke that was played upon you, wouldn't that be the only reason we would put it on the air? 
[03:19:30]  Oh, sure.  I wouldn't have a problem with that.  Okay.  But we all know who else was affected by this.  I stated that on the air.  And I'm still saying that we didn't have anything to do with this.  Right.  And we didn't know about it until it happened, until after it happened, until we saw the pictures today.  And didn't I tell you not to bring it up?  Because you still thought at that point that it was something that was done by somebody that was, like, random, some maybe crazy listener. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, so then what you're saying, it wasn't done randomly.  From what I'm hearing, I'm getting certain inklings that, yeah, it wasn't so random.  And that was the only reason why it was safe ground to bring up on the show, because it wasn't, in fact, just some nut.  Though what I asked you about earlier, though what I asked you about earlier, means nothing to you. 
[03:20:30]  So if there was, like, a bit, I don't know, out there about someone banging someone's mother that you have not to be played, guess what?  It doesn't get played.  Yeah.  Because of the other person it affects.  But if you found...  Right.  Right, Rick, but listen to me.  What did I tell you in the office before the show?  But, Rick, listen to me.  No, no, no, answer my question.  No, because I have to elaborate on what you just said.  Before the show.  If, in turn, my mother then called you and said, it's a joke, I'm playing on Anthony, then you would know it would be okay to air that bit, wouldn't you? 
[03:21:00]  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe, Rick.  Linda never called me, did she?  No, and that's why it's not played.  Linda never called you.  Linda never called you, did she?  Rick, you're making this sound like I was the one that perpetrated this.  No, no, no, no, no.  What I'm saying is that I'm talking to you because you're the only one that's talking right now.  But I asked you for a reason.  Rick, don't be an ass.  I asked you for a reason not to bring it up because of the other person involved. 
[03:21:30]  That wasn't what you told me.  No, that's not what you said.  I said it in the office.  No, it wasn't.  You said don't bring it up because of the privacy issue and of the other issue with other people that are now involved in this.  You never said because of Linda.  Never.  You said you didn't.  You didn't.  Sure.  You did not.  Selective hearing.  No, Rick, sorry you did not say that.  Selective hearing.  You did not say that.  All right.  You did not say that.  Dump out again.  Dumping out of the show.  Dumping out. 
[03:22:00]  Greg.  Dude, I told you because of, I already mentioned it.  It shouldn't even have, I shouldn't even have to explain this.  Just like Anthony doesn't need to explain about that bit because, you know what, we already dealt with it.  We put it away.  It's never going to see the light of day again.  That's not true.  I'll get that bit on again.  Fine.  I guarantee you'll get that bit on.  You want to make it better?  But I think that was a viable point.  If my mother had called and instead of her being offended by it, the joke was on me with everyone getting mad at it. 
[03:22:30]  And all of a sudden it's like, hey guys, I'm really not mad.  I'm just playing a joke on Anthony.  And then all of a sudden you pulled a bit out.  I'd be livid going, oh my God, this is insane.  How could you do this?  And then, ha ha, it's a joke.  Right.  But guess what?  What?  Linda never called you, did she?  So basically she's in the same position as your mother.  No, but I didn't know about the Linda angle on this.  It was a joke.  Anthony, we talked about it. 
[03:23:00]  We talked about it.  I don't want to bring up specifics.  Not about the Linda part of it.  You're not listening to me.  Yes, we did.  You thought it was a...  What did we talk about?  What did we talk about?  We talked about personal issues.  Exactly.  No, no, on privacy issues.  On privacy issues, correct.  Talked about privacy issues.  Right.  That you would like to keep this off the air because of issues of privacy. 
[03:23:30]  privacy, not issues of Linda.  She doesn't qualify as my private life?  No, I'm not saying that, Rick.  Well, then what are you saying, Ann?  I'm saying that wasn't the issue.  What I'm hearing is that you have no...  You have no...  You have no explanation.  No, the reason it wasn't to be brought up on the air wasn't Linda.  That isn't what you put across to us in the office earlier.  That was one of the reasons I mentioned.  I specifically mentioned it.  I mentioned it when I spoke to Opie this morning, how upset she was about it. 
[03:24:00]  And I relayed that on the air today.  We were under the impression that you didn't want it on the air because you honestly thought  there was some psycho listener out there that was kind of like...  Yeah, and isn't that why she's upset about it?  Because that's the reason why she's upset and she has every right to feel upset, you know,  because she thought that.  But it came to light during the show that it's obviously, you know, not a psycho listener.  Well, guess what?  She wasn't in on the joke.  So guess what?  She's still really freaking upset. 
[03:24:30]  I understand that.  I mean, the only reason I'm upset is because you guys decided to bring this up when I specifically  asked you not to.  Well, yeah.  How would you like it if I ran over to your house and put a big sign, Opie lives here?  Most people know where I live at this point.  Rick, don't curse, you idiot.  Rick.  Now you're just being an idiot.  No, I'm not being an idiot.  Yes, you are.  I don't think anything in those pictures, which... 
[03:25:00]  Calm down.  First of all, Ellie shouldn't have gone on the web.  First of all, Ann and I had no clue.  It was on the web.  People started calling like crazy.  The instant feedback came in.  I'm not talking about the website.  Ann said, you know what, you know, let's bring this up.  So we did.  I'm not talking about the website.  So we did.  As I've said repeatedly...  And you didn't stay in the studio.  I have a problem with you bringing it up on the air.  You didn't stay in the studio and fight.  You just ran out.  You just ran out.  You just ran out.  When Anthony said, let's talk about this.  Well, when somebody walks away from something that you want to talk about, guess what? 
[03:25:30]  That's a sign that says, hey, I don't want to talk about this.  I could go through this a thousand times.  The reason we talked about it is because we knew the reality of it.  You thought you were still thinking that it was one thing.  We knew it was another.  That's why.  And if the reason, if I knew in my head the reason was because Linda was upset, then we  wouldn't have brought it up.  That was one of the reasons I mentioned in the office. 
[03:26:00]  You guys don't pay attention to that.  No.  But a payback joke, and let me reiterate, we weren't involved in this.  It's not supposed to go on the air?  We're supposed to clear it with you first?  No, no, no.  Explain it to you off the air what it is and then go on the air with it?  It kind of takes away from the impact, Rick.  Payback jokes are fine, as fine as freaking the sun shining in the day.  I could give a crap about payback jokes.  Right.  As long as they don't go over a certain line. 
[03:26:30]  And if you notice that, guess what?  Rick, you were part of a joke where I punched someone in the face.  That's going over the line.  Holy shit.  I'm not going to curse here, but what are you kidding?  Following your logic?  And do you think if we...  The prank you were involved with, it turned out where I punched someone in the face and  could have, you know, got screwed over.  And people that are involved clear it with you first off the air and then we go on the  air and have that spontaneity...  No, no, no.  They clear it with the people they need to clear it with.  If they know it could be a problem attacking someone's private property, then yeah, there's 
[03:27:00]  a bunch of freaking things I've got to do or you pick something else to do.  Now you're being a hypocrite.  I'm not.  When you were part of the Billy and Paul J. Moore prank, that's exactly what you're doing.  Where you lived, or your car, or anything of your private life.  It had nothing to do with your private life.  How many people realistically could have got hurt with the Billy and Paul J. Moore prank?  It depends on them, I guess.  How many?  I don't know.  It's them.  It's their prank.  With them?  No, you were in on it. 
[03:27:30]  I was in on it at the last minute.  You were in on it.  Three days after the fact.  Since Thursday.  There are people outside to...  Three days after the fact.  There are people outside wanting to see Billy and J. Moore fight.  One of those people could have easily jumped in and got hurt or hurt somebody else.  Well, you know what?  So that goes against what you just said.  You were in on it.  So none of them were really going to...  All the listeners that showed up outside the Brooklyn Diner were in on it?  Okay, yeah.  And none of those guys are going to jump into a fight.  That makes a lot of sense. 
[03:28:00]  To defend you, I would have jumped in a fight with Opie.  I would have done it.  That makes absolutely no sense.  You've never jumped in a fight.  Listeners are not going to get in the middle of a fight.  That's not true.  They're going to stand back and they're going to watch.  That's not true.  Okay.  You can't...  That's why I say...  You can't know that.  You can't know that.  Let me run over there and get in the middle of the car accident.  No, you stand back and you'll watch.  You can't know that for sure.  Dude, I punched someone over a prank that you were involved in.  So I would call that going on the line as well.  No, no, no.  You punched someone over a prank they did that I found out about. 
[03:28:30]  You knew.  You knew.  I had no knowledge of the prank when it happened.  No setup with it.  I was not involved in any way, shape, or form.  Neither were we.  I was very late in the game.  Neither were we.  Thank you.  We're both on the same page.  Same friggin' page.  Because we found out about this late in the game.  Only we didn't wait three or four days after we knew to inform you...  Hey, it doesn't matter.  You know what?  Because I asked you before you even knew not to bring it up on the air. 
[03:29:00]  Before you even knew.  Because we didn't...  Before you even knew, I asked you not to bring it up.  I'll tell you why.  Yeah, because what?  We were going to milk it another friggin' day?  No.  We didn't have knowledge at that point.  And let you call...  By the time Anthony brought it up on the air, there was a lot of knowledge that came through  during the show.  Right.  I honestly, when I walked down the hall, I had no real clue about what the hell was  going on.  I started getting suspicious.  I figured we...  When I saw the pictures, but that's about it.  Rick, I figured we'd best end it now, instead of not saying anything and letting it go on, 
[03:29:30]  what, another day and night of you and Linda worrying about your privacy?  And I wasn't going to do it off the air.  Why not?  Off the air?  Yeah, off the air.  It kind of takes the sting out of it.  Well, what, we're going to go on the air and say, hey, listeners, you should have been  there off the air when Rick found out about this whole thing.  Well, guess what?  There's private lives involved.  It had nothing to do with on the air.  It wasn't even near the station. 
[03:30:00]  Do you see what I'm getting at here?  No.  No, no.  You don't.  Rick.  Jesus Christ.  I'm talking to two freaking idiots right now.  Well, now we can agree.  Yeah, that you two are idiots.  Yeah.  We'd never argue that point.  In the words of Rick, you made great radio.  That is a Rick quote.  Hang it up. 
[03:30:30]  All right.  Stay tuned for Don and Mike on most of these radio stations.  Lock the door.  How is he going to charge down here?  Lock the door.  I ain't freaking getting in a fight.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Wow.  Let's all go party.  We're going to have a fun little get together party.  Yeah, we were supposed to have an office party today, but yeah. 
[03:31:00]  I understand some of the things he's saying, but we weren't involved.  We had nothing to do with it.  Okay, terrific.  Shannon, thanks for coming by.  Can I see something just to calm me down really?  Which one?  That's the way to end the show.  All right.  There goes Shannon.  Thank you.  Cybervixenvades.com.  Anthony, Don and Mike are next.  Yes.  Don and Mike are now.  Are now.  I apologize to them. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  That was pretty intense.  We had a good show, though, today, didn't we?  That was a lot of fun.  All right, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Yeah, too.  Boobs.  The world's universal language.  Opie and Anthony, your linguistic experts.  Whip them out Wednesday.  M-E-W.  What's better? 
[03:32:00]  We're not doing great now.  We're doing great.  We're looking at real.  Let's do it.  How's it going?  This is going to come left.  Am proces for traditional reasons.  Who's possible to lose.  It's going to be a Shootout?  Now, on schedule.  What's it going to be a house?  I'veπό.  NotUMd.  Though.  Boy wäre it.  Today's video.  I've seen it.  Have fun with it.  Good.  Wait.  How are you doing it? </pre>
