<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, hosted by Rich Voss for a "Worst Of" segment, featured a chaotic blend of sexually explicit anecdotes, discussions of unsanitary hotel rooms, Rich Voss's struggles with smoking cessation, and his various online mishaps.  The show began with Voss recounting a story of having to retrieve his girlfriend, Bonnie McFarlane (later his wife), from a train station during a stand-up performance, with audience members helping in the search. Listener emails followed, criticizing Voss's behavior as "whipped."  This transitioned into a broader discussion about the seedy underbelly of the comedy world, focusing on the often-dismal state of hotel rooms, including descriptions of witnessing and participating in various sexual acts within them, often in graphic detail, and featuring the Mount Airy Lodge in the Poconos as a recurring example of particularly unsanitary accommodations.  The hosts and guests, including Colin Quinn, shared numerous stories of their own experiences with unclean hotels and bizarre sexual encounters in various locations.  Voss's attempts to quit smoking took center stage, involving humorous and sometimes confrontational exchanges with the hosts and Bonnie, who was present in the studio, even recounting a near-fire incident caused by a candle and a cigarette.

A significant portion of the show revolved around Voss accidentally revealing his universal password, "Comic630," on air, leading to listeners promptly hacking his Twitter, Facebook, and other accounts.  The ensuing chaos, featuring profile picture changes to images of Jim Norton in underwear and a horse's ass, altered bios, and an influx of "gay"-themed followers, was a major focus.  The hosts and listeners spent considerable time mocking Voss's repeated blunders,  including his frequent mispronunciations, which were cataloged on a website called "OA-pedia,"  resulting in a running gag throughout the broadcast.  Bonnie joined the show via phone call, adding to the commentary on Voss's linguistic blunders, and criticizing his perceived selfishness, insensitivity, lack of affection, and inadequate participation in childcare and household chores.  Their daughter, Jess, also called in, engaging in playful banter with the hosts and revealing details about her father's past.

Another major segment featured a planned cold reading of a scene from *A Bronx Tale*, with the unexpected participation of Chaz Palminteri, who heavily critiqued Voss's performance.  Throughout the show,  numerous sexually explicit anecdotes and conversations were interwoven, featuring graphic descriptions of various sexual acts and increasingly absurd and embellished fictional stories, often involving unconventional locations and unusual pairings.  These were frequently acknowledged as fabricated for comedic effect.  Discussions included explicit details about physical attributes, and one story involved a professor and a student engaging in sexual acts.  A game where Voss attempted to name actors from photographs, often misidentifying them, provided additional comedic moments.  Finally, a segment featuring outtakes and unused material discussed Voss's misguided belief that flavored corn nuts were a recent innovation, and recounted anecdotes about his relationship with Bonnie, highlighting his early extravagant courting habits that later diminished.  The show concluded with the hosts wrapping up, leaving behind a trail of vulgar humor,  sexual innuendo, and the aftermath of Voss's various on-air mishaps.  Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock also participated in the "worst of" compilation segment.

Tune in every day this week as a different comedian from The Opie and Anthony Show hosts The Worst of The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Hey, it's Rich Voss.  I'm hosting The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Five hours of Opie and Anthony you didn't get sick of listening to the first time.  So you're going to listen to it again.  It's some funny shit, believe me, because I think I'm involved in it.  You're hosting it.  No, it took five hours that they were listening.  No, no, no.  This is the intro to the show.  You're welcoming everybody there.  Hey, it's Rich Voss.  I'm hosting the show.  It's all about you. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, but they're not thinking the show is live, are they?  Hey, this is...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, I sound so fucking...  It's me.  It's Voss.  Today I'll be hosting The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  But I'll be here all day hosting this stuff.  And I'm not taking any calls today.  I'm not going to deal with it.  We're just going to go right through this.  Knock it out.  We're going to have a good time.  Go fuck yourselves.  Can you use any of that?  Yeah, that's fine.  You sure?  Yeah.  You'll edit it, right? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Oh, this bit.  I remember this.  This is where I took a call on stage.  I was working at a club.  And I get a call.  And the reason I took a call...  Well, if you listen, you'll know why I took the call.  And some guy calls in to smash me over this.  You know what it is?  I don't know.  I took a call from Bonnie on stage.  People that smash other people are guys that don't get laid or know how to get laid.  This was in the beginning of my relationship with Bonnie. 
[00:02:30]  So, of course, I'm going to take the call.  This is when I wanted her to like me.  You know what I mean?  So, I took a call on stage from her.  Listen to it.  You'll see what happened.  All right?  You don't judge me.  I judge you.  You don't come to the XM Studios and judge Rich Voss.  He's a good guy.  You know, I remember taking a call.  It was kind of funny.  If I'm on stage, no matter what, if the phone rings, I'm going to take the call. 
[00:03:00]  One, I'm going to ad-lib something out of it.  Two, it could be an important call.  Three, it's not like I'm fucking working for the queen.  It's probably some, you know, whatever.  I'm taking a call.  I'm a fucking important guy.  I take my calls.  No way an important guy would have somebody else take their calls, most likely.  Right?  Important guys don't even have a phone.  Huh.  I'm an every, every day, I'm an every, I'm, what do you call like an every man's guy? 
[00:03:30]  You know what I mean?  I'm a man man.  I'm the kind of guy that takes a call.  That's the kind of guy I am.  You know what I'm fucking saying?  Can I get the fuck out of this one, dumb bitch?  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Got an email here.  Hey guys, just got in from the anysoldier.usbenefit show at the Stress Factory tonight.  Starring little Jimmy Norton and Rich Voss.  Norton killed as usual, but that's besides the point.  Effing Voss.  He's so whipped, he took a call from Bonnie in the middle of his act. 
[00:04:00]  It went something like this.  During his act, he checked his phone once, and as a cover, he had to make a little hacky  cell phone joke.  So he says, fucking sprint.  They call it that because you have to run to find service.  Waka waka.  Ah, there you go.  A little while later, someone yelled out, how's Bonnie?  She's okay.  She'll be here later.  Wait, who said that?  Why am I answering you?  Who's Bonnie?  Near the end of his set, he couldn't grab the phone hanging from his pocket and get it  to his ear fast enough.  Where are you?  You're in New Brunswick?  No, I'm not bombing. 
[00:04:30]  You're at the train station?  Turns to the crowd and says, how far is the train station from here?  Yeah.  So then the people in the front row were all trying to give him directions for Bonnie.  It was a giant clusterfuck as people were naming the wrong streets and turns, and Bonnie  would have ended up a statistic in the paper.  So some dude from the crowd had to get up, go to the train station, and escort her to the  club.  Are you kidding me?  How effing whipped do you have to be to take a call in the middle of your set from your  chick?  Anyway, just wanted to share that with you guys. 
[00:05:00]  Aside from that dignity-destroying moment, he had a great set as well.  Maybe you could get him on the phone today and see how he defends himself.  This is from Lauren.  Did you see this last night?  No.  I decided I wanted to be responsible and come home and sleep.  Ooh, so you did your set and left.  Had my car jump-started for the second time that night because the battery is dead, and then  I drove home and backed in, and the stupid PR who works at my thing doesn't understand  English.  So I'm like, look, just leave it running until you back it in.  Oh, no.  He's like, leave me.  Why?  Why? 
[00:05:30]  So I had to stand in the garage while this little failure backs my car in, and then I  went upstairs and tossed and turned and dreamed of Black Sabbath at my birthday party.  Yeah.  Like a faggot.  That's cute.  Were you wearing a little party hat?  That was awful.  Happy birthday to you.  Where's the band?  They left.  Maybe I can dream next time that's my birthday and I'm kneeling in a bathroom and you put  your swamp ass in my face.  All right.  Well, we got Rich Voss on the phone.  Rich.  What's going on?  What happened last night, buddy?  First of all, Norton goes on. 
[00:06:00]  He kills.  Right.  He just destroys.  And he does it all the time.  He's such a weasel.  Yeah.  Whenever, oh, I got to go on in the middle because I got to get back home, you know?  Never.  The extra half an hour is going to kill him, you know?  I always close those shows.  It takes a prime.  I mean, he's funny.  He's got a lot of funny stuff.  Don't talk about me like I'm not here, stupid.  I'm right here.  All right.  And the only thing worse than your cell count is your battery.  So, okay, 0 for 1.  Well, but I don't always go on in the middle.  I just, I actually had a legitimate reason last night. 
[00:06:30]  We did a fundraiser at the Stress Factory a couple months ago for Levy, Bob Levy.  Yeah, you know what?  And I want to...  Shut up and listen.  One of our B comic friends is leaving him because he brings girls.  He brings girls on stage and eats whipped cream out of their asses.  Wait, who does that?  Bob Levy.  Bob Levy.  Oh, my God.  He brings girls on stage and eats whipped cream.  Blue cheese.  Oh, blue cheese.  And his wife is divorcing him, and he can't imagine why.  That's going to be fun in court when that comes up.  I know.  No pictures, right?  So we do a fundraiser, and Levy goes on, and he kills, but he's filthy. 
[00:07:00]  And Norm's like, I don't want to go on after him.  Can you follow him?  Yeah.  And I'll go, okay.  You know, he's too dirty.  And Norm, you know...  I didn't say he was too dirty.  No, I didn't.  What would you say?  I never could follow Levy historically in my career.  He's the one guy I was always...  I never wanted to go on after.  Well, you know what?  To get over your fears, you have to do things like that, okay?  Well, sorry, I can't host every show like you do.  I'll host.  What are you, fucking Bob Eubanks?  Every show you do, you want to host.  You're right.  I want to host because I know how to... 
[00:07:30]  Shut up.  ...show stupid.  So last time he goes on, and he destroys.  It's this really funny fluid comedy.  A lot of stuff about his fluids and different diseases.  Sure.  Destroys, right?  So I go on after him.  Sure.  Right?  And, you know, I do an hour.  No problem.  You know, you can follow him.  You can follow that kind of humor.  You just do stuff with punchlines and stuff, right?  Yeah, so, well, where are you from?  Yeah, I didn't work around all day.  Stuff with punchlines.  What are you drinking? 
[00:08:00]  So during the show...  Well, I'm not to interrupt you, but I'm sorry I had to get out of there.  But I was running late.  My cell phone wasn't working, so I had to sprint for service.  Or did you have to check your RSVP list to see if Black Sabbath is coming to the party?  That's a true story.  I had a little dream.  Yeah, you had a little dream.  Black Sabbath must have been really upset that they were all wet on in the face.  I can see upset little Jimmy in his dream that Black Sabbath wasn't at his party.  They were at the party.  MTV threw me a party. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  And there was a special treat, and then Sabbath left.  Did you tell me you had to leave the party early because you had to get up for work?  Sorry, but...  Anyhow, so...  I like the fact that you almost named somebody in Sabbath and realized you couldn't.  I know.  I forgot the guy's name.  Sorry, guitar player.  I can't believe you grabbed that one.  Wow.  So I'm on stage, you know, and I get a phone call.  Now, my girlfriend is coming from New York on a train, which she's never done. 
[00:09:00]  Okay, she's from Canada.  And she was coming from New York from her Letterman audition when she got the show.  And, you know, I never took the train from New York to New Brunswick either.  So, you know, I get a call on stage, and I kind of thought it might be her.  You know, New Brunswick is in a place you want some little white girl walking around.  And she got off the train, and I said, where are you? 
[00:09:30]  You know, I was wondering.  I was already at 50-something.  This was during your act, though.  I don't really have an act.  Thank God he's finally admitting it.  Okay.  You know, this was right before, you know, I was going to say, you know, you can get my new DVD to the audience.  You got a new DVD at richfoss.com?  Yeah, it's just, yeah.  And I guess the first people I thank on the DVD is my good friend, Zobie and Anthony, who, you know,  I don't call in the morning just to thrash them and trash them because their girl calls them. 
[00:10:00]  So she called, and I said, you know, I tried to get her directions, and people got up from, you know,  the audience and started walking out to go find her.  Not to help me, because she's hot, you know, and maybe they have a shot in three blocks.  You know?  So, you know, one guy goes out, and then she tells me some guy comes up and goes, I'm a cop.  You know, he shows his badge.  And, you know, and they walk her over to the, and the sprint joke is not a hacky joke. 
[00:10:30]  That's a funny joke.  I didn't say it was hacky.  I don't know.  Whoever called in or wrote in, you know.  But now we're getting a lot of people that are saying you're kind of pussy whipped now with Bonnie.  Well.  Do you blame them?  Jesus.  Well, but what's the, you know, what do you mean?  You know, finally a guy, you know, a guy is happy with, you know, this time with a girl.  And, you know, it's not like I, you know, yeah, I don't know if that's what you would call it.  I'm a good boyfriend.  You're not a good boyfriend or a good friend. 
[00:11:00]  You're not a good anything.  You're a creep.  Although, I'm kind of caught in the middle.  As one of Voss's best friends, I'm kind of caught in the middle between being, because she is really hot and they get along great.  And, look, they're a good couple.  But I'm caught in between being happy for him and wanting to smash his face.  Yeah.  When we're going to Albany, the phone kept ringing because they're in love.  It keeps ringing and he keeps answering it.  I'm like, could you be a fucking guy for once?  He would just answer the call every time.  I'm in the middle of telling a great Hummer story and how the guy reacted when I gave it. 
[00:11:30]  And, like, what was that?  As we're driving to Albany, he goes, can you be a guy and pull into this rest area?  Here's the thing.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Hi, poofy.  Yes, Nookums.  No, just driving with Jimmy.  Okay.  No.  I love you, too.  Oh, hold on, Jim.  Hold on.  We're at mile marker five.  Hi, Nookums. 
[00:12:00]  But, Rich, the problem is...  Wuffy, wuffy, wuffy, you, too.  I just realized that, you know, my relative is really, really sick.  Hold that thought, Jim.  Hold that thought.  Good improv skills.  I say my relative.  Could I have picked one?  My relative.  Well, really concerned.  One of my ancestors.  Stank. 
[00:12:30]  My kin is ill.  National comes.  Wow.  Richie, wuffy, you, too.  Richie, biggie, wuffy, you, too.  Oh, hey, Jim, remember the time I was getting a blowjob and you were dogging that chick in the...  Oh, hold on, hold on.  No, lover.  You're the only one in my life. 
[00:13:00]  My forever girl.  You're my forever girl.  You complete me.  Oh, Jim, you're getting pulled over.  This is a good opportunity for me to take this call.  Oh, I understand why you do it, Jim. 
[00:13:30]  Why you do it, Voss.  She's a very attractive, very nice girl, and I don't even understand for a second why she's with you.  I just don't get it.  That's why he answers the phone.  He's afraid if he doesn't answer, something's going to happen where she realizes what an ass she's dating.  Like, the phone's ringing for her, and she's like, why am I even with this guy?  Like, he's got to distract her right away.  Oh, let me get that immediately.  He doesn't even let the ring finish. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, hold on, yes.  Hello.  Oh, honey.  Is that you, darling?  Yes, baby.  Oh, baby.  Oh, honey.  Oh, man.  Is that you?  Don't hang up.  I'm here.  You know what the sad thing is? 
[00:14:30]  When it rings, her picture comes up.  I put that into my phone.  You're kidding.  I swear to God, her picture comes up.  It's the same ring right now that you're doing.  I'm getting really scared that she's really calling right now.  Hold on, guys.  Oh, that's great. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, Voss, you rock.  You met her at the roast, right?  We met her at the roast, and she's a lovely girl.  She's funny, too.  And, you know, what are the odds?  Listen, Norton's my best friend.  When me and her have sex, I definitely think of Norton's tits.  Voss, let me tell you something about Bonnie.  We felt guilty.  We talked about the roast the next day.  Ann and I were just looking at her boobs the whole time.  They're perfect.  And we felt kind of creepy, you know, because it's your chick and stuff. 
[00:15:30]  It's your chick.  But they were, like, falling out of that dress.  She was wearing something very low-cut.  You don't think I dropped a couple loads on my chest thinking of your girlfriend?  And then I'm thinking, you know, God, she definitely saw me looking at her boobs.  I couldn't help it.  Really?  Oh, my God, dude.  She was just so hot at that thing.  Jeez, Opie, relax.  She was so ridiculous and hot.  Opie just had his head in his hands going, oh, my God.  I was just like, wow.  Well, maybe you can get some his and her rollerblades and take her to Central Park. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, baby!  Don't listen to what Opie does that.  But it did feel like we felt like creeps.  And I discussed it.  We were walking back to, you know, like 57th Street talking about your chick's boobs, man.  Well, you had to look at something.  You couldn't see the stage from those awful seats we got.  Oh, God, the seats that Voss got us for that roast?  Yeah, thanks, Voss.  Well, I'm surprised you didn't take pictures of them in one day.  I did.  You didn't wear a celebrity seat.  I did.  I got pictures of how far away we were, actually. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I got that.  I got that picture, too.  We should put it up on opiananthony.com.  All right, I got it with me.  It was the Donald Trump roast that we went to.  And our seats were...  We were a special guest of Rich Voss.  Yeah, and as we were going, we just had to keep walking upstairs.  Like, no one else had to go upstairs.  They were all on the floor.  There were literally like 10 tables upstairs in the balcony.  No, but here's the deal.  You didn't have to be stuck amongst all those stuffy people down there.  Oh, right, and who were actually seeing the roast. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, who were we with the party people upstairs who were looking at the monitors?  God forbid we're actually in the building.  If you would have had quarters, you could have looked through one of those big viewfinders  and saw the stage from where you were.  It could have been a Bill Cosby roast from where we were.  I had no clue.  Donald Trump, what?  Who was that?  I wanted to hug Robert Klein.  Yeah, thank God I had enough quarters to put in the viewfinder so I could see the stage.  That's what I just said.  I know.  Thank you.  Well, okay, so I have every now and then a bad one.  Here's the deal.  You know, you're throwing nothing against the wall.  Here's the deal.  So, first of all, hold on, I got a call. 
[00:17:30]  I got a call.  What do you call it?  Do you know what those seeds cost at that roast?  Do you know what?  You know what?  Who's the first people I said to get into the roast?  My pal Norton, my pal Zobin Anthony, and I'll throw my family in.  I cut my sister loose to get you guys in.  Really?  Yeah, thank you.  She bothers me anyhow.  It was a lot of fun.  All right, Foss.  It was all right.  All right.  I got to get back up to bed.  It's easy calling me. 
[00:18:00]  All right.  Why don't you go back to bed?  This was a very successful call.  Hey, do you guys want to have sex live on the show today?  What's that?  You want to have sex live on the show today?  Oh, it takes me an hour for the pill to kick in.  Leave with that one.  Leave with that one.  Just walk away.  Just walk away, sir.  We'll do that one day.  Really?  Of course.  I will.  He will.  I will. 
[00:18:30]  Dude, you talk to her right now and make this happen because it'll be the funniest thing  I ever hear.  Are you serious?  Yeah, it's satellite radio.  We got a couple from California.  They're going to have sex next in a few minutes here.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  It could be really funny.  Would she be up for it?  I doubt it.  I mean, I would be and I could fake it.  Of course you would be.  Can I just jack off on your show?  She's not into it.  You could just watch her and whack off live on the show.  That could be funny, too. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, God.  Standing by the foot of the bed just jacking it.  Whispering so as not to wake her.  Roll over.  Roll over.  Jesus, Shred and Reagan are calling soon.  They're good guys.  Hey, are you playing a bowling alley in Suffolk County next week?  Is that where I'm at?  Oh.  Hold on.  My phone's ringing.  I don't know where I'm at.  I don't know.  If they pay me my money, I'm there. 
[00:19:30]  Can someone pick up my girl?  All right, Bob.  All right.  I'll talk to you guys.  If you want to call back and have sex, do that, all right?  Put the producer on the phone.  The producer?  His name's Ben, you ass.  Oh, no.  You Hollywood ass.  Who else called me?  Huh?  Somebody else called me.  Was that Ben?  It was Eric.  Oh, it was probably Eric.  It was Eric.  Yeah.  Know the players, bro.  You've been a friend for years.  I know.  I don't know the new guy.  Put the producer on the phone.  You don't know the new guy.  I don't know the new guy.  Eric's cool.  It's Eric, Ben, and Steve.  Can I speak to Rick? 
[00:20:00]  All right, Voss.  All right.  See you, Rich.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony hosted by myself, who is obviously Rich Voss, because  nobody else speaks like this.  We have some more of this stupid shit coming back after break.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hold on.  I can't do this with fucking gum in my mouth.  I am addicted to this fucking nicotine gum. 
[00:20:30]  I'm Rich Voss, and we're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  You know, coming up is some of the hotel sex stories and getting hotel rooms.  And, you know, here's a story I don't think I've ever told.  I mean, these are like stories of, you know, with girls and hotels and the nasty rooms in  New York and all around the country.  But, you know, when it came to picking up girls, I remember back when I had my roommates, if,  you know, we would go to the bar, my job back in the day when I was 22, 23 was to either, 
[00:21:00]  you know, get high, do coke, and go out and try to get laid at the bar.  And if we couldn't pick up a girl at the bar, you know, we'd go to the diner late at night  and try to get some, like, diner straggler at, like, 2.30 in the morning.  You know, she's walking from table to table, eating off everybody's plate like Helen Keller  or something, you know, and hopefully she was so out of it, you know, maybe at 2.30  and you try to get her because everything failed at the bar. 
[00:21:30]  So you might leave with a Biggums or some undesirable.  So when I had my roommates, I kept a mattress in the basement and if I was, you know, and  I picked up a girl that I didn't want them to see, I would sneak around back and I would  have sex in the basement and sneak around so my roommates wouldn't see her.  But I remember one time I met this girl and we went back to her place and I was sitting  in her basement.  That was a punchline, folks.  Get it?  I wasn't undesirable to her. 
[00:22:00]  Anyhow, here's some stories.  I tell that bit on stage.  So if you go, oh, you heard that already.  It is a semi-true story.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Is there something going on in New York this weekend?  I finally, you couldn't get a hotel room anywhere.  So that park place, the shithole park central.  Oh.  I stayed there, it's usually like 125 for a night with like two rooms.  Last night it was two and a quarter for one room, right? 
[00:22:30]  So, and it was, I go, I go, I asked for a smoking.  I go, I prefer a smoking room.  And I get there, there's no smoking.  They go, well, you asked, you asked for a preferred room, but it doesn't mean we give  you one.  Yeah, I know.  I love that one.  It's like going, you know, I prefer a radio in my car.  Okay.  A lot of people do, but you're not getting one.  You're not getting one, but I, at least they know what you prefer.  Yes, yes.  You know what?  Good.  I also prefer someone up in the room giving me a hand job every 15 minutes.  Then I go, I call down, there's no coffee pot. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, sorry.  Below the 18th floor, you don't get coffee, right?  I go, well.  Why?  Why?  They said there's no coffee pot.  And they go, below the 18th floor, if you want a coffee pot, it's $25.  I go, I go, fuck you.  I'll buy my own coffee pot for $25.  Oh, my God.  But, you know, $25, I'll have, you know, someone from Brazil bring me a cup.  So, $25 for every hotel has coffee that you've been to.  That's the crappiest hotel in New York City.  Dude, when I couldn't deal with the commute anymore from Long Island, I made a deal, made 
[00:23:30]  a deal.  The company was really, you know, we bitch about the company, the old company, but one  of the nice things they did for me, they put me up in that hotel three days a week,  so I didn't have to commute anymore.  So, I know all about that hotel.  It's a shithole.  Thanks for putting you up in that place.  Well, we were whatever, you know.  Awful.  It's because if people come over from Europe, they're stupid.  They think they're staying in some nice place because it's...  Dude, one of the hottest things I ever saw, though, was in that hotel.  You know, do you get the inner room where it's the courtyard? 
[00:24:00]  No, but I've had rooms looking in other windows.  That's what I mean.  It's like, uh, not a courtyard, but it's, uh, how can I explain it?  An atrium?  Not even that.  It's just, uh, you look out your window.  A breezeway?  No, you look out your window and you see windows across the way, but it's relatively close.  It's only maybe 40 feet away, and then windows to your right and left, so it's a box, basically,  when you're looking out your window.  And a girl just goes up to the window one day while I was, uh, at my place, completely topless, sits on the ledge to smoke a cigarette, and then starts, like, fondling herself. 
[00:24:30]  Wow.  Really?  I'm like, yeah, really.  Now that's worth the room for us.  That's $40 below the 18th floor, if you get that.  Yeah.  Dude, after that happened, every time that I, uh, stayed in that hotel, I requested that, the, the room that overlooks that weird, like, square.  Does the shade close, and then you gotta put more money in?  That's hilarious.  You know what?  It's such a, it's such a shithole. 
[00:25:00]  They probably hire her to get people to come back.  You know, she checks in eight hours of, you know, titty touching.  I was sitting there bored one day, and all of a sudden, this girl comes to the window.  I'm like, am I seeing this?  And then, then I used to, uh, see, uh, uh, other people, like, just walking out of showers naked and stuff.  I guess it's, that's, that's where you go if you're an exhibitionist or something.  Wasn't that the place that we were, we were eating across the street at that restaurant?  We were looking up at the window, and there were two whores in the window, like, trying to get our attention. 
[00:25:30]  Remember, we were eating that, and we were like, holy shit, were they hookers or something?  Wait, where, wait, why don't I remember this?  I think we were eating at the Greek place.  The Greek place, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah!  We were looking up at the window, and there were two shits up there.  That's the same hotel!  Yeah.  Something's going on with that hotel.  Really?  There's hookers?  I don't know what, I don't know what that was about, but I forgot, were they, they weren't really naked, though.  They were just kind of fooling around.  They were, they were, they were trying to get our attention.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or you were in the hotel?  No, we were, we were eating outside, on one of the outside sidewalk places, and we were looking at the hotel, and there were chicks up in the window, and they were trying to get our attention, like, they wanted us to come up. 
[00:26:00]  Those are good hookers.  They're barking through the window.  Yeah, pretty much it.  It's like the Old West hookers hanging out at the saloon, you know?  It's a weird hotel, though, man.  Next time you stay there, get the room that overlooks that weird square thing, though, because I guess you'll see nudity like no one's business.  It's amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  It's something about watching someone through a window, you know, without them knowing is so exciting.  I think you were, were you with me or somebody else that, when we first moved back to New York, the Eastside Hotel, they threw me in for about a month, two months? 
[00:26:30]  Were you there when the old guy was banging the hooker?  No, I missed that one.  I was there with the old woman in her lingerie stirring the sauce.  Stirring the sauce every afternoon.  That was, yeah, we've told that story a million times.  Oh, yeah, I remember that.  I get this hotel room, and I go, Ant, you got to come over, because my window over, it was like Rear Window, that movie, I'm not kidding.  My window overlooked a whole apartment complex, and I was just, every day, because I'd just moved back to New York, I didn't really have any friends, and I was bored after the show. 
[00:27:00]  So I'd sit at the window, just like Jimmy Stewart did, and you'd see little dinner parties going on, you'd see some pervert with his telescope trying to look at the hotel to see what's going on.  Every once in a while, I didn't really see any nudity.  Maybe a girl in a bra and panties was the best I did at that point.  I got through those things.  But then all of a sudden, we'd see this old lady coming home every day, at the same time, middle of summer, it's like July, August, and she would put on a one-piece old lady bathing suit, 
[00:27:30]  go into her kitchen, and you see her go from the living room to the kitchen, and then just start stirring sauce like this, over and over again in her old lady bathing suit.  And we'd watch for hours.  Might have been pudding.  Could have been.  Because the old people liked the pudding.  It was so depressing, though, because that was her thing after work.  Morbid.  She would just mix the sauce.  Anyway, so I'm looking out the window, and then I notice if you look all the way to the left, but really sharp, you have to press your head up against the window, 
[00:28:00]  and stare way to the left, you could see into this one room, but barely.  That rings a bell.  You were there, I'm telling you.  I remember, because it was painful to watch, because you really had to...  Yeah, you had to squash your whole face on the window and look sideways, and you could kind of...  A couple of idiots we are.  You could kind of see in the window, right?  Yeah.  But you couldn't really see much.  But then Anthony and I discovered that there was some kind of art piece or something,  and the glare on the art piece, right? 
[00:28:30]  You remember now, right?  Like, the glare on the art piece, it gave you a perfect angle into the bedroom.  They're in a hotel sitting with a mirror like they're in prison.  Yeah, exactly.  That's exactly what we were doing.  And it turns out it was like an old, a really old guy.  Like, he had to be pushing 70 at least.  Yep.  And this young thing and this really hoary crap, awful hoary crap, not just awful,  and they were just having sex all night long. 
[00:29:00]  He must have been on the Viagra or something.  And every once in a while, like, you could look through the picture,  and you could see stuff going on in the bedroom, not enough to really keep your attention,  but every once in a while, she'd walk out to go to the bathroom,  and then you'd have a perfect shot, because I guess our angle was, you know,  to the bathroom or whatever, and she'd just be in this hoary crap.  And then one time, the guy walks out, he's got like, I don't even know what you're called,  like the worst underwear where his butt exposed, you're just like, oh, God. 
[00:29:30]  Ball bag.  Ball bag type of thing, right.  But, yeah, we did that for freaking days.  I said, Bess, I was in a hotel, we were on the road, and I'm having sex with my lady friend,  and I'm fucking, I'm on fire, and someone starts banging on the wall,  and it made me feel like I was, like, so excited that someone...  You were being too noisy.  Yeah, can you keep it down?  I was so happy.  The noisy people.  The, you know, some of the guys... 
[00:30:00]  The headboard going, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.  But I would never, if someone was doing that, I would have my ear to the wall.  Oh, my God, that's the best.  When you're in a hotel room, and all of a sudden you hear...  Yeah, the...  Really muffled...  Oh, well, you did the bit, actually, Anthony.  Yeah, where you hear it.  All of a sudden, just hear a little...  Yeah, it starts...  It doesn't...  It doesn't squeak anymore.  It doesn't squeak anymore, yeah.  They oiled my mic, the mic stand. 
[00:30:30]  It used to squeak like a bed.  And then you...  You don't want to hear the guy.  I like hearing the little whimpers of the girls, like, screaming a little bit.  Did you notice when we were at Mardi Gras, walking down the halls?  Oh, what, the sex going on?  Oh, my God, it was like an orchestra.  It was like an...  I'd never heard more sex in a hotel than when we were at Mardi Gras.  A bunch of drunks.  Walking down the hall back to my room. 
[00:31:00]  It was just in every other room going on.  It was awesome.  Let's go to Bill in Vegas.  What's up, Bill?  Billy.  Hey, Billy.  Bill?  Hello.  Bill.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  This isn't Bill.  Bill?  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, okay, I hear you now.  All right, what's up?  Hey, I was staying at a hotel, Valentine's Day, a few years ago.  They had a Valentine's Day weekend special for lovers, blah, blah, blah.  So I'm listening, and I'm hearing this couple in the room next door, and they were going 
[00:31:30]  at it hot and heavy and long.  I mean, they were good at fucking, and they were good at fucking each other, you know?  I want to see who these people are.  I want to see who they look like.  Of course, you know, I had a vision of, you know, just who they were, what they were, you  know, you know, puffed up, puffed up, you know, out of the pages, et cetera.  So I waited and waited and waited.  Finally, I hear the door open.  I stick my head out.  It was a short, dumpy, bald guy, and, you know, a matching wife, you know? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, they're into it, though, huh?  Story punching out.  All right, thank you.  He was hoping that they were really hot, and they were just two messes, I guess.  Yeah, two messes.  I was working in the Poconos once at Caesars.  I was just going to bring that up, that place.  I was actually going to ask you if you ever played there, because the people that go there,  oh, my goodness.  Well, we were just getting divorced, separated, so I'm depressed, and I go up, and my wife  is moving out.  You've got to explain the Poconos, though, for the rest of the country.  They were just selling the heart-shaped tubs on TV the other day. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, from the Mount Airy Lodge.  Yeah, it's just, in my opinion, it's just an awful place to take your check.  Oh, it is.  It's an awful, awful place to take your check.  Dirty rugs.  Yeah.  The food, the buffet, it's like, you know, it's horrible food.  There's so much sex going on that the cleaning staff cannot, this is my opinion, there's  so much sex going on up in the Poconos and these crazy Mount Airy Lodge-type places that  the cleaning staff can't keep up with the jizz anymore.  So they're like, well, what the fuck? 
[00:33:00]  We'll just, like, we'll just, we'll just get rugs that it'll, it's, it's, you won't know  what's on it anymore.  You know how, you know how casinos put rugs that are the same color as their chips?  Yeah.  So if you drop a chip, notice this next time you go into a casino, the chip color is the  same color as everything that's in the carpet.  So if you drop a chip, you're not going to be able to find it.  It's, it's kind of a way, I'm sure they get money that way.  Those scumbags.  They think of everything in Vegas.  Yeah, they certainly do.  In those Poconos places, it's just sperm-colored carpeting so that if you're a new guest, 
[00:33:30]  you won't notice the dried yellow or the fresh whitish beige.  Right.  And it's all in, it's all in some kind of flowery pattern.  Right.  You don't know.  You walk on it, you feel like a fly stuck to fly paper.  Yeah.  But I'm convinced, you know, at first.  You're not taking a bath in that heart-shaped tub.  You're making soup.  Right.  At first, they probably had, you know, good intentions.  We'll keep all these hotel rooms nice and clean and stuff.  After a while, though, obviously, they just said, ah, we can't keep up with it anymore.  I've been there. 
[00:34:00]  It's hysterical.  You go, you know what it's good for?  You go, you get pitch black hotel rooms with cool things like the pool in the room.  So you can have a little, you know, little hijinks going on with your chick.  Things like that is fine.  Now, if you're going there for the entertainment or that, no offense, but for the most part,  you're not getting rich Voss when you go there.  Thank God.  That must have been a nice special treat for the guests.  But you're getting crap.  The food is awful.  We ordered pizza and just had it sent to the room. 
[00:34:30]  Never left the room.  And they have games for you to do.  Like, they have a schedule of, like.  Yeah, there's a schedule.  They send you this schedule on a ditto.  And you look at it and go, like, I'm going to partake in any of this crap.  There's shuffleboard out back.  Anyway, you're going to meet these families that hope they, you know, trade keys with them  or something.  And they come and people fly in.  Like, that's a resort to something, you know.  We met, bumped into going to the room.  No, I think it was getting food.  We were going up to get some snacks or something. 
[00:35:00]  And there was a couple that came all the way from Nebraska.  It was their honeymoon.  And we're just laughing at them.  The honeymoon at the Poconos.  That's their big honeymoon.  Was Niagara Falls sold out?  Yeah.  You know, it's like comparing pork roll to scrapple.  It's a shithole.  I was going there to work.  This was years ago, right when I was getting divorced.  So, right, I'm sitting.  As I pull in, right, I see a big heart. 
[00:35:30]  You know, love.  All right.  You know, I'm ready to blow my brains out.  I see couples on chariots, right?  You know, and I'm just getting divorced, right?  They're all hand in hand.  And I'm doing the show and it's all couples, right?  And so I'm back in my room crying and jerking off in a heart-shaped tub.  Right?  With mirrors surrounding me.  So there's mirrors all over the room.  Yeah, there's mirrors all over.  I got tears in my eyes as I'm spanking it.  I can see myself in like 30 mirrors. 
[00:36:00]  Because you go there, you've got to use the jacuzzi because it's free.  So you're sitting alone in a heart-shaped tub going, it doesn't get any worse than this.  Did you take your clothes off and hop in the big champagne glass?  Yeah, they have these big champagne glasses that you can fill off.  It's like a two-story little condo room that you're in.  And the top floor is how you get into this champagne glass. 
[00:36:30]  And the champagne glass is right in the living room.  It's like there's a fireplace, the living room, and then the champagne glass is two stories high.  And the top of the champagne glass is a hot tub.  But it's see-through.  It's glass and everything.  So you go up the stairs and go into the thing and you're sitting in this hot tub.  That's the champagne glass.  It's goddamn ridiculous.  Kill a cheezola at best.  I don't know what's worse, sitting in the tub, in tears, jerking off.  Or when you're done and like when you have an orgasm, it floats to the top and it comes towards you. 
[00:37:00]  And it's like, then it gets on the hairs and it's like a little hard.  Something about water and jizz, it turns into hard like jelly.  Like a little jelly fisher coming at you.  Like someone melted gummy bears onto your hair.  And then there's someone that has to clean these rooms when you leave.  And like I said, they just gave up.  Somewhere along the line, they just gave up really keeping those places spotless.  Oh, man.  Didn't you find a rubber or something, one of your old stories or something?  Never found a rubber in the room, I don't think. 
[00:37:30]  Under the bed?  No, there's no under the beds in those places.  I'm trying to remember.  I'm trying to remember.  There was some horrific thing that you discovered in one of your rooms.  We had gotten glow-in-the-dark paint once.  There was this glow-in-the-dark paint, glows-in-the-dark.  And we're just slapping it all over each other and stuff.  And we didn't think about where else it was going.  So when we were ready to go to sleep, we turned the lights out in the whole room. 
[00:38:00]  It looked like a murder scene.  There was glow-in-the-dark paint, handprints, footprints all over the place.  The entire little condo they give you was just covered in glow-in-the-dark paint.  And like you see some glow-in-the-dark paint on the wall.  It's two handprints and a cheek up against the wall.  You go in the bathroom, shut the lights out, and it's just on the mirror. 
[00:38:30]  It's great.  That's funny.  Trash the place and glow-in-the-dark paint.  They made a stain like a cabin once.  I was hoping it was like an employee thing.  I felt like I was staying in a bunk in Auschwitz, right?  It was like just a bed in a wooden box.  I am essential to the whatever.  Oh, that place is ugh.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, we got some great phones coming in.  They try to make it sound like it's great.  Like, you know, as couples, you're going to enjoy that.  And a lot of people go, I think, are couples that are trying to get the spunk and spark back into their relationship so they're older. 
[00:39:00]  And it's just an awful place to go.  The activities they have.  Hey, take the paddle boats out on the lake with your loved one.  And it's this friggin' love canal contaminated lake that you take your loved one out on.  Oh, they got, like, a game room with an old Miss Pac-Man and an unlevel pool table.  And a Skittle ball with a half a ball.  It's horrible.  Exactly.  It's just horrible.  And then you order food late at night and they have, like, the tuna that they scrape off the side that's brown. 
[00:39:30]  It's brutal.  There's slogans to just be facing people.  There's nothing to do here but fuck.  I know.  That's it.  That's it.  There's no fun going on there.  You go there to have sex.  When you can't afford a cruise.  Yeah.  Come here to the Poconos.  Come to the Poconos.  And then there's idiots that go there, like, when it's too cold to play golf, but not cold enough to go skiing.  So they're stuck doing absolutely nothing. 
[00:40:00]  Nothing.  Fucking deers are walking by the window, giving them the finger, going, you're old.  Deers are going, look at these two fat losers trying to have sex.  Did I say deers or deer?  Whatever.  Whatever.  The entertainment is horrific.  I went there and it was supposed to be, you know, I'm going to go see some comic.  So we decide, you know, let's leave the room.  We'll go see the comic.  It was a comic magician.  And it was awful.  He was doing a bad Amazing Jonathan impression. 
[00:40:30]  It was that bad.  It was horrific.  We're sitting there going, and, you know, we're a little jaded because we know some pretty good comics, you know.  And the acts they got up there were so bad.  The singers that get up there singing Frank Sinatra.  And you're just at the bar wanting to open a vein up.  And then two hours of the newlywed game before you.  Oh, yeah.  They got the newlywed game.  Oh, come on.  And they bring people up from the audience.  And the guys.  And after two hours of just embarrassing yourself, you win a T-shirt. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  They give you a T-shirt, send you back out to the crowd so they can look at you.  Like, ugh.  A free night back at the hotel.  Yeah, that's what they give away.  They give away a free night at the shithole you're staying at.  So you come back and spend four more nights.  I'm here, pal.  I know how crappy this is.  This is no prize.  This is no picnic.  You drive up, and it's the cheesiest thing.  Like you said, all the hearts.  Welcome to the, you know, home of love.  And, oh, they got a little chapel there.  So if you decide, oh, this is going great, let's get married. 
[00:41:30]  What a disaster that would be.  Getting married at that place.  A couple of Kodak Instamatics of your happy day.  When you have to sit there and shake your wedding pictures until they develop.  Maybe it's not that special a moment.  When you've got a sketch artist doing your wedding.  When the witness to your wedding has to leave because she's got to clean the jizz off the sheets.  Yes, must go. 
[00:42:00]  Must keep in.  I didn't know we had Jeff Foxworthy in the studio today.  If you have to shake your Polaroid pictures, you might be a redneck.  Goddamn awful, horrific place.  But I tell you, you know what the trick is?  If you have a chick that's funny with a sense of humor and stuff, and you know what you're getting when you go there, it is funny.  You will laugh your ass off.  Man, you make a great point.  It's really funny.  If you know how to just go with it. 
[00:42:30]  And have fun.  You'll sit in that cafeteria thing and be next to people that want it.  Because it's that, the seating is a, what do they call that?  When you don't get your own table, you're sitting at like a big picnic table with a bunch of people.  What do they call that?  Yeah.  A reunion.  So you're sitting, oh, it's called a nightmare.  When you're sitting there and you're hearing these stories from people.  Me and my chick, we still to this day talk about some of the people that were at that table.  The couples, and they're like, yeah, we drove up from Georgia, got the pamphlet about the place and decided, we're gold members here. 
[00:43:00]  We've been here, you know, we're a couple of the lovers.  We're lovers' couples.  We've been here five times.  They gave us the love.  Look, we got our tags.  And they're proud that they've been there five times and stuff.  Then you get the black people that are gold tooth members there.  It's just a nightmare, but it really is fun to goof on.  I got fired from there.  You got fired from?  I was working there. 
[00:43:30]  What, were you too entertaining?  I think I made like $600 for the weekend.  You're making the crowd laugh, you idiot.  And I did some racial stuff, and I said black guys don't eat, you know, unless it's fried.  Well, we got complaints, all right?  Just the fact that they even came to the front desk and talked to you people, you should be happy.  What are you talking about?  They're not checking out.  Not about your show, but we got to blame somebody.  We get complaints all the time.  This place stinks.  So then they rehired me again, and one of the guys said, he goes, personally, I think you're the worst. 
[00:44:00]  You know, this is someone, be ready to go on again.  No way.  He goes, I don't like you at all.  Yeah.  You know, have a good show.  Right?  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Hire Shecky Blumberg next time.  Sure, I'll bring in the crowd.  I didn't work there for years, but then I go back to do a show with a couple guys from Last Comic 2.  Yeah.  So from $600 to like $4,000, $600 for a weekend to like $4,000 for one show, you know, and now all the people are being nice and this and that. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, true.  And the guy that said I stunk was in the audience, but he, and of course I brought it up.  Remember me?  You fired me two years ago.  All right?  Well, I'm back doing the same shit.  Oh, I don't, maybe I don't say coochie, I say pussy now.  I don't know.  Whatever I say is the basic.  They don't need it.  Five times more money.  Asshole.  But it was, that was a good show.  The place is a big theater for some reason.  It was the theater that they had.  The theater at the, is it the Caesars one?  Yeah, this one was nice.  The theater, the audience was great. 
[00:45:00]  It wasn't nice.  It was, it was a great show.  I had a good time.  You want to go back again?  We are going back.  This one was nice.  Oh, this was the nice one.  Yeah, this was the good one.  Yeah, okay.  This wasn't Mount Airy.  The one that's inviting you back.  This wasn't Mount Airy.  This was Caesars.  This was the nice one.  Mount Airy.  Why don't we go to the phones?  Sure.  They have exploded.  Steve on Long Island.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  My wife actually wanted to go there because she had gone there before.  Really?  Mount Airy Lodge.  Well, see, she went there before with somebody else, right?  Right.  Oh, you don't want to do that. 
[00:45:30]  That's got to like.  Yeah, because you know their old jizz is still in the room.  Yeah, that's got to play on your head a little bit.  So I'm walking through this shithole that they call Mount Airy Lodge.  To the room, looking at the carpet, if you could call it carpet, I opened the door to  the room.  There's fucking shag carpet.  It was four years ago.  Yep.  Shag carpet.  Shag carpeting in these places.  You walk into, it's like you're walking into an old Rat Pack movie.  I swear to God.  It's just shag carpet, tacky paintings, like bad Italian wrought iron and velvet. 
[00:46:00]  It's horrible.  There was a poster of the dog shooting pool and two dogs were missing.  It was terrible.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  I walked down, we went to the dinner thing, they had that entertainment with some shit  bag lounge singer.  And I just tell my wife, I'm like, what, she's going to pull the mic away like she's going  for distance?  Sure as shit, she did.  Punch it out, guys.  All right. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, that's, uh, they're just the old, they never updated those places.  They're still stuck in the, like, early 70s, late 60s look.  John, New York, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, you fucking bastards, I had to walk out of my house because I'm taking a wife there  in two weeks.  And when she's here, oh my God, is that true?  I'm like, no, no, no, they're talking about a different hotel.  Not where we're going.  Wow, have you been there before? 
[00:47:00]  No, it's the first time.  We're going to one at Caesars, though, so it's got to be good, man.  Which one?  I've been there.  Yeah, Caesars, they're not bad.  Which one are you going to?  Shut up.  Which one?  We're getting the Diana's Oasis.  Oh, God.  Oasis.  It's got a two-person shower, the pool, the heart-shaped jacuzzi with the round bed.  Oh, yeah.  The round bed with the mirror over it, that's always good. 
[00:47:30]  And for an additional $55, I got her a little basket with glasses in it and strawberries  and whipped cream.  Oh, God, you're going to go the whole route, aren't you?  Oh, I felt...  You know, the strawberries and whipped cream sounds great at the beginning, and it's going  to be good, it's going to be like a movie, until you're trying to go to sleep after you've  banged and you're both passing out, and you smell like sour milk because of their whipped cream.  They never show that part in the movie.  You smell like an old cow udder.  You smell like Norton's ass. 
[00:48:00]  You're breaking out in hives because the strawberries are four weeks old.  Now, I'm going to think about it.  After I get done banging the wife and we're smelling strawberries, I'm going to think about  Norton's ass.  Thanks.  And don't forget, 11 a.m. is archery if you want to kill your wife for making you go there.  Okay, you can go after screwing, have some archery.  Some archery's at 11.  And shot putting is at one.  All right, guys, punch it out.  Love you.  Have fun, John.  Rent a bicycle.  Yeah.  A bicycle built for two.  Paddling boats.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, yeah, like, just what I want to do is paddle. 
[00:48:30]  Paddle a boat out there, sure.  That's always fun.  Drop your pregnant wife into the water at their lake.  I'll have a heart attack in the middle of a fucking dirty lake.  All right, here we go.  Dirty lake.  Ryan in New Hampshire.  Hey, Ryan.  Good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up, buddy?  My brother used to manage a really nice hotel up in central Vermont, and he said to me,  he says, don't ever bang your girlfriend or your wife on the comforter.  Always pull the comforter back because they never watch them.  Yeah.  And if you want to see something good, take a black light or something. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, yeah, you take the black light and it glows on the jizz stain.  Thank you 60 minutes from eight years ago.  I know.  Really?  Take a black light?  Really?  Is that what you do?  A black light groovy.  Thanks for the info.  Yeah, that's how the guy show preps for our show.  He watches old 60 Minutes reruns.  I read an article, because everyone knows about the comforter and the black light and  the groovy black light, the day glow posters.  And, you know, a lot of people have done that. 
[00:49:30]  Yes, Opie?  Go ahead.  I was interrupting.  Go ahead.  I read an article, though, that said you should check, screw the comforter, you should check  the remote control.  And think about it.  The remote is something you're handling with your, you know, you've got it in your hand.  A lot of times when you're getting room service, you're eating as you're in the bed and you're  watching TV.  Now, think about when you've had sex in hotel rooms.  After you're done, what's the first thing you reach for?  You go and you're watching TV now.  You know, you've had your hands in places. 
[00:50:00]  And then you rub your eye.  And then your eye's itchy.  What the fuck's going on?  Dude, that remote is the most disgusting thing in a hotel room.  Because...  Why doesn't it change the channels anymore?  I remember when I used to change it with my tongue.  The buttons are sticking.  You change it with your tongue.  I used to do it with my tongue.  It was a magic trick I learned from the show earlier.  Oh, that was disgusting.  I turned on a blacklight in one of the rooms and there was cum in Jimmy Hendrix's hair  on the poster. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, it's on the TV thing?  Yeah, the remote control is like the most disgusting thing in a hotel room.  I was just going to say...  They don't clean it.  With the whole comforter thing?  Yeah.  Even in the nice hotels, you can just tell.  They don't really wash them.  Yeah, you've got to take them off the bed.  Yeah, I know.  How could they wash all of those hotel covers?  You know how expensive that would be?  They do at the Park of Meridian.  Yeah?  I know it.  I've seen it.  When they're going down the hallways, the carts, they're loaded up with those comforters  and they wash them.  They bring them, switch them from one room to the other. 
[00:51:00]  All right, bring room 17 to 42.  That's funny.  Let's go to John in New York.  John?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, John.  I have to tell you a story.  A buddy of mine about 10, 11 years ago took his girlfriend at the time to Mount Airy Lodge  and they were in the room and they were doing it and they felt something on them.  It turned out there was a bees nest in the outside wall and the bees had eaten through  to the inside.  Wow.  And they were there for three days and for three days they complained and had like shitloads 
[00:51:30]  of bees in their room and they didn't do anything about it.  Of course they didn't.  Well, you know, if you put the black light on the bees nest, you'll see cum on the bees  backs.  Bees backs.  They got back.  They wrote all kinds of letters, did all kinds of shit.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  That's why that place is closed.  Is it closed?  Yeah, the Mount Airy Lodge went out of business and recently they've been auctioning off all  their stuff and they never updated Mount Airy Lodge. 
[00:52:00]  So all this stuff they're auctioning is like antiques and they were auctioning off the heart-shaped  tubs.  Did it come with a putty knife?  Scraping it off.  Yeah, you know, right before they closed, they weren't cleaning those things out.  Big ring.  The remote control stuck to the tub without Velcro.  Let's go to Cap in Kansas.  Cap.  Hey, ONA, boss.  What's up, man?  Hey, man. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, I used to work at this campground in Southwest Colorado and I swear every fucking day we  would like walk by and we'd see these old people passing keys back and forth and then  we could walk through the campground at night and see the camper shaking.  It was the grossest shit in the world.  Really?  Old people having sex?  Old people having sex.  Well, it wasn't as much that.  It was just like who the pairings were.  It was so fucking gross.  Yeah, old people are weird when it comes to their sexual habits.  If you're old and still having sex, you're like weird. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, you gotta stop.  You're kinky weird.  You can't just be old and have sex normal.  They gotta get into the...  Because you ever watch HBO Real Sex and those things?  I love that show.  They're always like swingers and they gotta train.  They have to go to the nude campground.  Yeah, nude camps out in the woods where the men are together beating a bongo drum going  all naked with each other and hugging.  You ever see this?  It's ridiculous.  They had this real sex show where...  Real sex, that's a wrap.  ...where guys wanted to get closer with their sexuality. 
[00:53:30]  And it wasn't a whole gay thing.  That's what they were claiming on this episode of Real Sex.  So, couples would go to this campground, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Or retreat in the woods, whatever.  And the couples would, you know, separate, right?  And so it would be the girls over here, the guys over here.  And the guys would have to do activities like go in the woods as a team or as a group,  get completely naked, and kind of...  Didn't they do like kind of a group hug?  They were in a huddle.  Like a huddle, naked, going... 
[00:54:00]  Just like moaning.  Like...  As one guy plays a bongo drum.  One guy's playing a bongo drum.  They're all hugging and going...  And there's a guy in a Cub Scout uniform jerking off, peeking from behind a tree.  Could you ever think I would sit and make it in front of men and groan?  Why would anyone do this?  And then the highlight of the whole trip, I guess, was the mud party or something. 
[00:54:30]  Did you see that one where they got this huge mud hole and everyone would get in?  And it was like some kind of mud orgy.  People weren't actually having sex, but they were feeling up other broads.  Yeah, all of a sudden, you know, you look over and your chick's got a hand on her ass  and it's some other guy covered in mud.  These are such...  These are the kids that went to the school that Billy Jack used to run.  And they grew up like little liberals that, you know, would tie-dye and eat granola throughout life. 
[00:55:00]  Because you cannot get a normal family or couple that says,  let's go to the woods and rub mud on each other.  They're hippies.  I saw another one on that real sex where it's an old couple.  And they were at this kind of...  I guess it was to teach the women how to have an orgasm kind of thing.  And they go through a whole oral sex and using dildos and stuff like that.  So there's this old couple sitting there.  The guy's going down on her.  And he's licking her box.  And she's like writhing around going, ah. 
[00:55:30]  And they're going, just feel the pleasure.  And she's like, ah!  And then they have an interview with her.  And they go, yes, well, we're grandparents.  And all you can think of is, oh, my dear, sweet Christ,  what if the grandchildren are tuning this in?  It's not like, you know, they can't watch it.  It's HBO.  And that old thing probably looks like an old catcher's mask.  A mitt or something.  And it's hanging.  So I screwed up one fucking line.  A mitt mask.  You were doing so well, too.  I know.  Looks like a cleat. 
[00:56:00]  Did you see the one where they want the girl to really relax so she's naked?  And then everyone else gets to touch her?  Gets to rub her, yeah.  Gets to rub her and touch her.  Yeah.  Just relax and rub.  A couple guys working her boobs.  Another is stroking her hair.  And then someone else is fingering her.  And someone else is giving her a foot massage.  And is her boyfriend or husband standing there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's standing there rubbing and laughing along with everybody else.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss. 
[00:56:30]  Hold on.  My phone's ringing.  See?  Look at this.  My phone's ringing.  I'm answering the phone now.  Oh, that was a text.  Who's that from?  Can you bring me home a coffee, please?  Who would text me that?  I'm not coming home.  Oy, oy, oy.  Anyhow, these are some hotel.  You know, why would my wife text me when I'm hosting a radio show?  And why would I pick up the phone?  These are some hotel sex stories, some dirty seedy hotel stories. 
[00:57:00]  We all have them.  We all have them.  You know, you've picked up a girl and you don't know where to bring her.  And you go to a $14.  One time I left a bar with a girl and I had, you know, it was back to I had no money.  We go into this hotel.  I swear to God, as I'm having sex, I see a roach crawling up the wall.  And the first thing on my mind was, please, I hope this didn't crawl out of her legs.  You know what I mean?  But then I realized the hotel I was in probably had roaches. 
[00:57:30]  In one hotel once, a comedy club put me in a shitty hotel and I found there was a bed bug or a tick and I saved it, you know, to prove, get me in another fucking hotel.  I'm not going to stay here.  I'm a semi-major headliner.  I don't care what fucking hotel you stay in.  I don't care if it's a five or six star hotel.  There has been jizz shot all over the place.  Nothing good can come out of a hotel. 
[00:58:00]  You know, you never were in a hotel going, well, I feel cleaner than when I went in.  You see what I'm saying?  So listen to these stories.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  When he was talking about these horrible hotels, I mean, I got some, when I told, I took this one girl to one of these really crappy hotels after the bar.  She was so hot, right?  Yeah.  I banged her sister years ago, but this one was the hot one.  So I took her to the hotel, and it's like, you know, 30 bucks or 40 bucks.  So we go within like two minutes in the room, three minutes. 
[00:58:30]  I, you know, I finished.  I came.  It was just, I couldn't hold back.  So I called the front desk, and I said, I saw a roach so I can get half my money back.  Because I don't want to spend a second, I don't want to spend a night when I was going to get, I was going to get up again.  So I go, I just saw a roach, this clamber.  So I got half the money back.  Can you tell, you are.  I'll tell the one about the other one.  Can you tell my favorite hotel story, or the motel story?  Yeah.  My favorite.  I don't even care if the faithful listeners have heard it a million times.  It's great for the new ones.  Did you go to the front desk with a menorah and matzo in your hand just to really push across that Jew point of yours? 
[00:59:00]  Well, it's not a Jew thing.  It's a Jew thing, you cheap fuck.  No, but I'll spend, I'll drop money all over the place, but there's certain, like, you know, I'll spend $500 on dinner for friends, but pick up golf tees the next day.  It's weird stuff.  You know, if you shoot a load in three minutes, you want some money back.  You should win a prize, right?  It should be like, you know.  Tell the motel story where you picked up the girl. 
[00:59:30]  So I picked up this one girl after a show at Rascal South.  So we go, I go, let's go to the diner.  You always take them to the diner.  That's to, you know, get them alone first and to the car or whatever.  So we're outside the diner parking lot.  We're making out in the car.  And she goes, I can't do this here.  It's a diner parking lot.  I go, okay.  So I pull next door into the car wash, right?  So she goes, I can't do it here.  So I go, okay, well, I know a nice place.  Not a nice place.  It's just a little dumpy hotel, whatever.  And it's on the other side of the highway.  I drive there.  And it's like a crack hotel, right? 
[01:00:00]  I mean, the place doesn't have a car in it.  It's like a total.  Yeah, the parking lot is completely empty.  It's completely empty.  So we're in the car fooling around before I go in.  And she, you know, gives me a handjob.  And I come, right?  I have an orgasm.  So I'm thinking, well, you know, I'm fucking not going to get a hotel room now.  So I go, hold on.  So I go, well, let me go in and get a room.  So I walk in, right?  I come back out, and I look at her.  I go, they're all sold out. 
[01:00:30]  And she said, there's no cars.  I go, yeah, it's a crack hotel.  They don't have cars.  They don't drive.  They don't drive.  It's all sold out.  They've all walked up.  You're such a creep.  But I gave her my CD as a parting gift.  I do that to a lot of girls.  She wins.  Here, take a little piece of me home with you.  When you hate your life, this can confirm it.  Right.  Dan, anything?  Nothing.  See, this is what stinks about commercial radio.  They're doing sports.  That's why.  They did.  So they do.  I don't want to hold the show up, man. 
[01:01:00]  No, you're not.  We just got another great little story from Voss there.  Yeah, that's the problem, though.  They do a long commercial break.  Then they do traffic and weather.  Then they do sports scores.  I hate when regular shows just read the sports scores from the night before.  Why bother?  Big Duties Jay from Jersey.  It's not a Jew thing.  It's premature ejaculation.  I know.  That's what it was.  What was that other feedback you were reading while we were in commercial about the Mount  Airy?  Oh, yeah.  There was a good one that was kind of funny. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, the guy said he was banging his wife over one of the armrests of the couch at the  Caesar's Paradise Stream.  Yeah, you know that place, Rich.  And he's banging his wife over the armrests.  And he looks down and notices what he thinks is a pile of dandruff.  And he realized it was jizz flakes.  You know, when a little too much air hits and it gets like the mashed potato flakes.  He said there was a pile of it on the floor. 
[01:02:00]  Eric from Colorado, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Last year, my wife and I went up to Niagara Falls on vacation.  Yeah.  And we stayed at the Embassy Suite.  Yeah.  And the hotel that's next to us is the one that's sitting at the Minolta Tower that has  a revolving restaurant.  And our room, we were like, I don't know, 24th or 25th floor or something like that.  And I was sitting in a chair.  My wife comes up naked.  We started having sex. 
[01:02:30]  She was sitting on my lap.  And we got a call from the front desk.  The restaurant manager said the patrons of the restaurant were complaining about a couple  having sex with the windows open or the curtains open.  And they could see it.  And they were, you know, they didn't like seeing that while they were eating.  See, you know, who would complain?  Who would complain?  I'm a big-time voyeur, man.  Who would complain over that?  You know what was even worse?  Is when we were done, I got up to go to the bathroom.  My wife grabbed this vibrator that we brought with us, turned around, and she sat down in 
[01:03:00]  the chair, opened the curtain, and faced the outside of the window and started playing  herself with the vibrator.  Oh, what a team player.  One minute, we had somebody beating on the door.  It was hotel security.  And they said, you've got 10 minutes.  And I said, for what?  We're not doing anything.  Oh, yeah.  And the guy's like, you know, we just got this.  And I said, you're welcome to come in here and look around.  The guy can walk in that time frame. 
[01:03:30]  I had taken the vibrator.  When I came out and I saw what she was doing, as soon as I heard the knock on the door,  my wife ran in the bathroom with the vibrator and closed and locked the door.  The security guard walked through, couldn't find any sex toys.  The curtains were closed.  He said, I don't know what the hell happened.  He walked out.  And the last thing he said to me, he turned away, was he said, next time, I don't care  what, you're gone.  Get the vibrator sniffing dog.  It's in here.  All right.  Thank you.  The restaurant had a run on clams during that whole period.  It was like a subliminal thing. 
[01:04:00]  I don't know why, but I'll have the clams.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss.  Yeah, this is Rich Voss.  If you want to see where I'm working, go to richvoss.com.  My dates are under schedule.  That would be a good place to put them and come to the stupid show.  You're going to have a good time.  Believe me.  I'm not going to lie.  I just had a club say they won't use me again because I'm too mean.  That's a West Coast club. 
[01:04:30]  You know, enough of your fucking babiness.  Mean is funny.  Mean is funny.  That's all I'm saying.  You see an old lady fall, ha ha, you laugh.  You push her, you really laugh.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Mean is fucking funny.  I hope you're using all this because this is funny.  Me just talking is funny.  Me reading.  Stop.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Brought to you by Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Bastards.  Starring Brad Pitt.  In theaters August 21st.  Now here is.  Here is your ES-197. 
[01:05:00]  XM.  Thank you.  202.  The virus.  Be home.  Yes.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss.  Hello.  I'm Rich Voss and we're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I hope you guys took care of everything you had during your little break there because we've got some funny shit coming up.  You know, filling in here now, if I look back, it's been about three years since I quit smoking cigarettes.  Over three years.  Three years and a couple months. 
[01:05:30]  And this, I mean, they take some of the credit for it because they were attacking me, quit smoking, quit smoking.  But let me tell you something.  Opie and Anthony aren't that fucking powerful in life.  Everybody knows they have to quit smoking.  You know, maybe they help a little push towards it.  But no matter what you do, they're going to try to fuck with you because I was back in studio here.  I was back in June and they were smashing me for the Nicorette gum, you know, just because maybe a guy's been on the gum for three years. 
[01:06:00]  They try to find fault and everything, you know.  Maybe it's taking me a little time to wean myself off the gum.  Maybe I'll start smoking again to get off the fucking gum and then go back on the gum.  Oh, that was fucking horrible.  I said that joke on stage and I can't believe I redid it now.  But what I'm saying is three years, you're right.  I have an addictive personality and, you know, this is the last thing I have in life is this Nicorette gum.  I don't eat red meat.  I don't gamble.  I don't, you know, I don't get high. 
[01:06:30]  So, you know what?  I have gum and buying clothes, you know, which my closet's full.  Besides clothes, my sexual orientation is hanging in there.  That's not the word orientation or sexual.  So, what would be the word of my, you know what I'm saying, in the closet, my sexual, uh, fuck.  You know, I would have gone so much farther in this business if I had a better vocabulary.  I know I would have.  It's just that I kind of thought when I was younger that, you know, it was just overrated. 
[01:07:00]  A lot of, you know, vocabulary, punctuation.  I've said it before.  But what I'm saying is the Nicorette gum, I'm almost off it now.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm almost off it.  So, uh, listen to this.  Uh, there you have it.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Rich Voss in studio with his lovely wife, Bonnie.  Thank you.  We're going to do our acts together this time. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  That's what, people, people like, well, uh, you know, email us from MySpace.  So, you guys go on stage together?  Yeah, all of a sudden we're fucking still in the mirror, right?  Oh.  I can't even get her to bang me.  I'm going to get her to do, you know, comedy with me.  It's just unbelievable.  Is the banging way down already?  Oh, it's unbelievable.  That's not true.  Huh?  Well, with us it is.  I still bang.  Each other.  I still bang, but sometimes you're not in the room. 
[01:08:00]  She's so fucking dizzy.  We were in the hotel the other night.  She's so what?  Fucking dizzy.  What?  What do you think I said?  Rich, dizzy.  Yeah, I have an inner ear infection and I literally am dizzy.  Oh, all right.  We're in the room.  That's fine.  That was a fucking 40s expression.  I know.  What a dizzy dame.  You know what else he always says?  Dizzy broad.  I hipped you to Diet Coke, didn't I?  He thinks he hipped me to everything.  Hipped you to it.  Stop taking your Lenny Bruce character so seriously. 
[01:08:30]  Listen to me.  We're fucking in.  And I'm dizzy broad.  I hipped her now.  I took her.  I mean, we're in the hotel the other night.  Go on, Daddy.  So the smoke alarm.  The smoke alarm's going off.  She goes, can you press the button?  So I go up there and press the button.  I go, your cigarette.  She goes, your cigarette is making a smoke alarm go off.  And next to her, on the bed, the little dresser, there's a fucking towel on fire from her candle.  She's sitting there reading.  And there's a fucking towel on fire. 
[01:09:00]  She's going, you've got to put your cigarette out.  No, but like it was still five.  What were you, bedrock?  Fucking lights.  I don't even use a light.  But you do have to.  Because I light a smelly candle because of the cigarette smoke.  Yeah, stop smoking.  Why don't you stop?  Oh, my God.  Somehow get it.  We're not going to your funeral if you die of lung cancer.  Why don't you stop?  Well, I didn't think you would.  You didn't go to the wedding.  Why would you go to the funeral?  Jesus.  Imagine that.  Oh, when it's, oh, I can't make it that night.  Oh, Rich. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, boy.  Finally, Patrice and Billy Burr bring a present.  He smashed us.  You're taking that hard stuff.  No, no, I'm not.  I let it go.  We all explained ourselves on our past show.  I let it go.  So, dude, why don't you shake it smooth?  I am.  I'm going to go to a hypnotist.  I just got the link for it.  I just got the link for a hypnotist.  What the fuck kind of dog shit answer is that?  Not a hypnotist.  A fucking laser.  You can get laser surgery.  That's a really big difference.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  Laser?  Yeah.  To quit smoking? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What do they do?  Unless they weld your mouth shut.  No, I don't know.  What do they do with a laser?  I think they actually laser a part of your brain, don't they?  No.  I can't fuck my brain up anymore.  They cannot laser a part of your brain.  Yeah, just someone like Nicholson at the end of Cuckoo's Nest.  Stop it.  In Staten Island, some lady I met said she got laser.  There is no surgery.  She was wearing a toga.  I got the link.  Let me tell you something.  We will look at the link.  Give it to Iraq.  He will punch it up.  I will guarantee you there is no way they touch your brain with a laser to make you stop smoking. 
[01:10:30]  They do something, maybe googly your eyes or something.  It sounds like a scam to me, Rich.  Rich is trying to find a way to quit smoking that's not going to hurt.  Zero pain.  Stop it.  Esty took me down for the patch.  I love to fucking smoke.  You smoke more than I do, but I smoke for 17 years.  Jimmy liked to smoke, yeah.  Anthony, one day I was going to quit.  I said, I'm going to finish this pack, and Anthony was just fucking put the cigarettes down. 
[01:11:00]  I said, I'm having one more.  I had one more.  It was a Friday.  I went down to the cellar.  Esty marched me over, got me the patch.  Oh, really? Just marched?  Was he leading you with an SS patch on his fucking shoulder?  Was he fucking Adolf?  Yes.  We marched.  He cleans out the apartment complex.  The patch had a swastika on it.  Yes.  Lovely red patch, I'm like.  Why are you still going for bargains?  Why don't you just go to a reputable guy and get it done? 
[01:11:30]  He wants to do it without pain.  Rich wants to quit without the fucking emotions.  You're going to cry a lot.  I've been crying for five years since I quit.  I don't understand that the guy is an addict.  You have overcome booze and drugs.  And gambling.  So you know that the only way to really stop, there was no patch for crack.  There's no fucking laser for booze.  I think that was all lies.  You've got to just stop.  Yeah.  I think that's all bullshit. 
[01:12:00]  I almost stole Rich's joke in front of him, or Bonnie's joke in front of Rich.  That it's all bullshit.  No, who once said that Rich only did drugs as an excuse for blowing guys?  Is that you or it was?  I just thought of that and I realized that's not yours.  I said I quit just for the applause break on stage.  Yeah.  That's funny, but that's not what I was quoting.  No, but that's another joke I threw in there.  Oh, of course.  Let's see, you do what I say that you always do.  What?  You try to steal the laughter from whoever got the last laugh. 
[01:12:30]  Yes.  Yes, he does.  You're saying what Rich does is Rich was piggybacking that moment and trying to be the last one  to speak so it looked like his moment.  It's called tagging.  It's called tagging.  You didn't tag it.  You didn't tag it.  That's not a tag.  That's a whole new little story that you brought up.  Yep.  Oh, look, this is comfortable all of a sudden everywhere she goes now.  She's on stage now.  This is a fucking broad.  I was reading a piece of paper in L.A. off a stool.  Now she's on stage with her foot in the front table fucking leaning into the mic and working  the crowd.  Okay.  And every now and then one of my fucking lines comes in and goes, hey, you know, you got 
[01:13:00]  so many of them, but she's getting too confident and that's the problem.  I'm going to have to bring you to the stress factory again to fucking humble you.  I don't give the same love as I used to.  Wow.  Remember when they first hooked up, it was just about love.  Yeah.  When we first hooked up, it was.  It's kind of a drop off here, just a bit.  Wow.  And Golly over here, he's getting a little scared of his position, I think.  I also hear a lot of avoidance about the smoking question.  Yeah.  Okay, Dr. Phil. 
[01:13:30]  That's right.  Dana Reeves just died.  Absolutely.  She didn't smoke.  She didn't smoke.  She had the secondhand smoke, they're saying, or something.  The secondhand smoke from what?  Was his wheelchair a locomotive?  What the fuck is the guy who was smoking, Nira?  He had little kids and an invalid.  She was like one of those torch singers.  Oh, so she was in a lot of clubs.  That's what they were saying.  With the smoke.  I had a little info on that.  All right.  Very good.  I'm glad you did.  I know I sound stupid, but she was a singer in the lounges back in her day. 
[01:14:00]  And they're saying maybe it was the secondhand smoke from way back when.  I don't think that.  I think that whole secondhand smoke is bullshit.  Why don't you just quit?  What are you so scared of?  Uh, because...  You have fucking kids you want to see graduate college.  Why don't you stop?  My kids aren't going to college.  Oh, okay.  They keep smoking.  You have kids that you're going to have to drop off at the butter bing.  Hey, were you in...  That's a regal beagle.  Were you in Sacramento?  Yes.  Last week? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Richard.  Get an update.  A review.  Yeah.  A review.  Excuse me.  I was going to go in Sac over the weekend on Sunday.  Oh, you were there on Sunday?  Yeah.  I couldn't believe you smoked on stage.  That was awesome.  Was that?  Oh, yeah.  Because you're not allowed to smoke in a club.  You rebel.  You're not allowed to smoke within like 10 feet of a building in Sacramento.  Yeah.  That was awesome.  Bonnie killed two.  Yeah.  We did...  I did...  That's a good show, huh, Richard?  Oh, real good.  Yeah, right on.  Cool.  That was great.  He tore a couple audience members up.  Yeah.  That was awesome.  I mean, Richard... 
[01:15:00]  Richard...  Rich Vossier gets a bad rep sometimes.  We like to kill him on the show, but...  Takes a lot of heat on the show, but very funny when you see him live on the stage.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Now, the bottom line is, Voss, you've been lying about quitting for years.  Listen, we're talking about my fucking stage performance, and all of a sudden you've  got to...  The guy brought up smoking on stage is what happened.  Said he was...  Yeah, so Richard killed, and he was smoking.  You'll be talking...  You've been quitting.  I'm going to quit on my birthday.  I'm going to quit on my anniversary.  I'm going to quit this, and every one of them passes and you don't quit. 
[01:15:30]  I'm sure we got tapes from N.E.W. of him saying he's going to quit soon.  Yeah, we want to quit.  That was years ago now, Rich.  You can't fly and smoke in the airport.  It's awful.  I smoke in the airport.  It's in the bathroom.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you stop?  Why don't you get so scared of?  Just stop.  I'm not scared.  Well, I am scared, but you know.  What else do I have?  What do you do on the flights?  You're not going to lose a piece of your dough.  I do nicotine gum.  New York to L.A.  What do you do?  Well, he complains a lot, number one.  You're afraid, Rich, you're afraid, A, of being uncomfortable, and B, like you're going 
[01:16:00]  to lose a piece of who you are.  You're not going to lose a part of yourself.  Okay, here's the deal.  I'll make a deal with you.  We'll pick a date, and I quit smoking, and you quit deviant sexual behaviors.  I've already quit smoking.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I quit camera.  Hold on.  When deviant sexual behaviors put a tumor on my jaw, I'll quit doing them.  What about a fucking lesion on your face?  Not my problem.  I'll just pass it along.  No, see how easy it is?  What are you so scared of? 
[01:16:30]  I've already quit smoking.  I've already quit gambling.  I quit drugs.  I'm talking about an immediate health risk that's going to fucking kill you, dude.  Some of Jimmy's girls have looked like tumors on his jaw.  I know what you're saying, dude, but I'm not being holier than thou.  I'm not saying quit addictive behavior because it's naughty.  I'm saying smoking is an immediate awful health risk.  I'm not making a moral judgment.  I'm saying it's a fucking horrible risk, and I've quit.  I know how awful it is.  And I'm not being self-righteous.  At least you get the AIDS.  You know, you got 10 good years.  Absolutely. 
[01:17:00]  You can fucking always just pretend you got it from a needle or, you know, blood transfusion.  I get sick once.  And you will look thin at some point.  Bad dentist.  And you could eat all you want, right, because you're going to lose the weight eventually.  And I haven't, and my sexual addiction, I'm not running into a bathroom in the airport anymore.  That's because it clogged up all the holes in the dividers.  It does look, though, Jim, like you purposely try to find women who may have something wrong with them.  I, I'm not saying, look, I, I, I, I, I'm not saying that an uncle 15 years ago doesn't help my cause, because it does. 
[01:17:30]  The worse your family, the better it is for me.  But 15 years ago, you knew better.  Oh, yeah, maybe more than 15.  Not the girls I'm dating.  Your uncle touched you when you were 21, 22?  One.  That's what I'm saying.  15 years ago.  Your uncle didn't touch you.  There's nobody that desperate in your family.  Why don't you quit smoking?  I'm good.  Here's, here's the game plan.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Okay, I'll make a deal. 
[01:18:00]  There's a plan now.  That's good.  June 30th on my birthday.  Oh, God.  I will.  The first, one of the first things you said to me when we started dating was that you were  going to quit smoking June 30th on your birthday.  And June 30th came went without incident.  You didn't even bring it up.  I was already bagging you, so what the fuck?  I already closed the deal.  I had to come up with a new lie.  And his sober date.  He was going to quit on a sober date.  I've heard that one.  I've heard I'm going to quit after the holidays, after the stress. 
[01:18:30]  There's never a good day to do it.  Yeah, you just have to trick yourself.  You just have to one day just go put your cigarettes down.  And realize it's going to hurt a little bit.  If I still obsessed, I'd be smoking again.  You think I could go this long obsessing?  How long did you quit?  December will be five years.  No.  Wait, December of 2001 will be five years in December.  I remember when that was.  It was when we were doing the What Have You Got segment of the show.  I had a moment about it.  What the hell is that?  Oh, yeah, the guy brought the login.  It was What the Hell is That? 
[01:19:00]  No, the guy was.  We had a couple of doctors in the studio.  And we had guests come in.  Hey, Colin.  Hey, Colin.  I was actually.  Take his seat.  Take his seat.  Colin Quinn just ripped Voss out of his seat.  Took his headphones.  You were raped.  Oh, man.  That's the most exercise he's done in a month.  Colin, you picked the perfect day to stop by.  You picked the perfect day to stop by. 
[01:19:30]  Get in on this.  Voss is telling us he's going to quit smoking again.  But as Colin walked in, I was thinking about Colin.  That's fucking really creepy.  That's correct.  You're a psychic.  Is that an awful bandage on your nose?  That's from one of the girls he's dating.  Let's get Colin Quinn a mic.  We need a chair for him, too.  What is that?  Colin should not understand.  You look like I'm expecting Bud Fox to save you.  Nothing.  No, that's not bad.  LA Confidential.  Hey, come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Just threw his breakfast on the floor. 
[01:20:00]  The reason I came by, by the way.  Okay.  Are we going to have an intervention or something?  Something.  Yeah.  No, it's an intervention for you two guys.  Oh, what do we do?  A little power corrupts.  Apparently, from giving this idiot a voice on the radio, he drove me home last night.  His Toyota Caddy.  Have you seen that Camry that he calls a Caddy?  Toyota Camry.  Norton, have you seen it? 
[01:20:30]  It's the worst Cadillac ever.  It's nothing like he showed it to me.  He was like, oh, yeah.  It looks like a Camry.  So he's got the most awful GPS that, like, you know, it's crayons.  It's an eight-year-old girl.  And then, uh, so last night we're driving home, this moron goes to me, you know, I don't  believe much in conspiracy.  He always has to deny that he believes in everything, and then he believes in it.  Like, Tom usually, so he can feel like he's a unique guy instead of just another, uh, you 
[01:21:00]  know, strip mall idiot like the rest of us.  And he's like, I'm not a conspiracy guy like some of these idiots.  Then he goes into this thing about the wingnuts.  We heard about it, yeah.  It was just so aggravating.  I felt like saying, you know, either do charity or learn a musical instrument.  Fucking phony bore.  It's so boring.  It's got a shit out.  I mean, if you saw these photos, he goes, give me away.  I'm not giving you my fucking emails.  He can wait.  Send me some shitty pictures. 
[01:21:30]  Go back to porn.  At least then you were kind of excited.  You're phony.  Instead of reading a book or taking a class, this is what dumb people do to feel intellectual.  They check out, like, the sides of planes and go, all right, I mean, if you look at  the vector, because some other asshole sent it to him and go, you know, this is not a  757.  Yes, it probably is, but who gives a shit?  You boring idiot.  Take that thing off.  Is that a sleep apnea thing?  What else could it be?  Colin, you're on fire.  Don't sit down. 
[01:22:00]  I'm not going to sit down.  He's working the room.  He's pacing back more than just doing some crowd work.  I think you're fat because you don't have to, you know.  Oh, my God.  We all do that, though.  We'll read all those political books and then just reciting what we just read to other  people and claim it's ours.  But I was honest about where I got it.  I didn't say I made it up.  I said that I found a credible source.  The gravitas in his fucking idiotic face is what got to me.  He put the pressure on me, though, now to dispute this.  But you'll watch it.  He goes, I'll send you the link, watch it, and then you tell me where the piece came 
[01:22:30]  from that is in a 757.  That's right.  Tell him to prove it.  Then you dispute it.  Then I go, well, what's the motive?  I don't know, but.  Well, that would be part one of this argument.  But I don't know.  Tell me the motive.  But then don't bring it up until you have a motive.  Well, I don't have to have a solution.  No, a motive is different from a solution.  Yes, it means that a motive is a solution as to why it happened.  Why would the government shove a plane into the Pentagon?  I don't know if they would.  Because they were waiting for the right opportunity.  So that day when two planes went into the World Trade Center, they said, now's our chance.  Quick.  Because the ones that went into the Trade Center are legit. 
[01:23:00]  It's that Pentagon one.  Yeah.  They just had it sitting there waiting for that to happen.  He raised some good points, and I had to say he raised some good points.  And you raised no good points.  I didn't say I did.  Beat it.  I really felt good to play in.  Little bars in town.  I saw him last night.  Bring him in.  Fucking Colin.  Beat it.  Beat it.  Well, we were talking about Rich Voss and his dumb smoking.  He's got to stop smoking.  Yeah, why don't you stop, stupid?  I smoke three packs a day, and I quit.  When do you quit? 
[01:23:30]  Fifteen years.  But he won't tell us why he won't quit.  He keeps making excuses.  He's afraid.  And setting dates when he might quit.  You want to know why he won't quit?  Because I fucking smoke.  We all smoke.  Jim smoked.  He quit.  Because you're afraid to deal with the sadness and the fear and the anger that's going to  come out when you quit smoking.  You don't have something to hide behind.  True.  Most of all, I deal with anger and fear on a daily basis.  Yeah, by lighting up five packs a day.  I know.  And the fetal position.  Oh!  Oh, no. 
[01:24:00]  Some use the missionary position.  Use the fetal.  Do you know that fire that you were talking about in the hotel room?  Yeah.  Is directly because of your smoking, not because of her candle?  She lit a candle to stop the smoke.  That's right.  No, she was reading tarot cards.  No, that's not true.  If she was reading tarot cards, she's as crazy as you are.  She needs some more.  Were you reading tarot cards?  No.  Were you reading tarot cards by candlelight?  No.  I get a, you know, a scented candle.  Oh, my God.  And it's just for the... 
[01:24:30]  Because it's night.  And it's just for the smoke, right?  Yeah, it's for the smoke.  I don't know where to put myself because no one will rip it apart.  Do you make them open up the anti-suicide windows like that fraction of an inch?  Last night I was there.  Yeah, you were there puffing out there.  It doesn't work.  Blows it right back into the room.  One night I look over, he's in bed with a cigarette, asleep.  Oh, that's never resulted in thousands of deaths.  Did you ever see his old apartment on the fucking floor?  It looked like little black snail trails because this fucking lazy Jewel kept falling asleep 
[01:25:00]  with cigarettes in his hand and dropping them on the floor.  He's not going to die from lung cancer.  He's just going to burn up.  He's going to take a bunch of people with him.  He's fucking, he's sanding something and putting varnish on it and he falls asleep  and fucking kills everyone in the house.  What's Little Richie afraid of when he takes the cigarette away and there's no barriers  between him and the world?  That's right.  What is, I'd like to know too.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just, you know, it's, I'm not afraid of anything.  What is Little Richie?  You are.  It's addiction and, you know.  Right, but where does addiction come from?  Pile of ashes.  It's a gold chain and teeth. 
[01:25:30]  Well, it comes from, you feel comfortable sitting there with something blocking, a big wave  of smoke blocking you, not only from the world but from your alleged wife.  Absolutely.  Well, she's reading tarot cards.  She's reading the tarot cards.  I'm not reading tarot cards.  By candlelight.  And tea leaves.  Yeah, she's got to read tea leaves.  It's the modern day knitting when a husband's not really.  Yeah, these two are coming up with hobbies so they don't have to hang out with each other.  How quick did this fall apart? 
[01:26:00]  This is the shortest marriage.  I want to fucking know what exactly, like, you are, like, everyone hides.  You hide your fear behind fucking cigarettes.  Other people hide certain failures behind a lot of food in the last year and a half.  I knew it was coming.  I know.  Can I theorize something?  Great telegraph acting technique.  Jesus Christ.  Can't wait to see Lucky Lou here.  We call it King of Queens with cursing.  Perhaps, Rich, you, when you started smoking, whatever it was, 20-some years ago, when, how long was it? 
[01:26:30]  I don't know.  Okay, so a long time ago.  30-something years ago.  You needed the cigarettes because of your, whatever, your fear, your unhappiness.  And now you're addicted, but maybe you don't need the cigarettes anymore.  You have a lovely bride.  Maybe you're better.  You should be happier now.  I'm very happy.  I got a lot.  Look what you scored, bro.  I'll tell you what it is.  Yeah, he did score big. 
[01:27:00]  The problem is, you still want to think I'm Rich Voss, a teenage rebel, or an old man, a few years away from Boca.  Just admit it, and you're in the cigars.  And walk around.  Your new edition could be complaining about your ills.  Old Jews don't smoke.  What's the matter with you?  I hipped you to Jews.  It's cigars.  You leave my stuff alone, Noah.  I won't touch your stuff.  But you got to stop smoking.  I'm going to.  I really don't.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Set a date.  Just set a date.  Set a date?  Not June.  Set a date. 
[01:27:30]  But don't do it for us.  You do it now.  You don't set a date.  How many times do I say I want to quit smoking?  You don't set a date.  Never.  You know what you do?  I've never heard you say that.  Where's your pack?  Huh?  Here's how you do it.  Where's your pack?  It's out in the car.  You know what?  Anthony goes to that side.  It's on.  Anthony goes to the old school Ron Conkoma style.  Give me the pack.  It is.  Ron Conkoma.  In Anthony's families, you just see one of the uncles come out in the Bermuda shorts  with the sandals.  Give me the pack.  He's smoking.  Give me your cigarettes.  Give me the pack.  You quit?  There you are.  Done.  Just fucking Marksoma. 
[01:28:00]  But that was how he helped me quit.  He fucking, Anthony helped me quit by that same disgust to just fucking throw the pack  out.  You immediately throw it away.  And I did.  I had one more and that was it for me.  Yeah, because it's Juano or one of these people, remember?  No, no.  It was the guy with the thing on his lip jaw.  We were playing.  What the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  We had doctors in the studio.  Let's do that again.  People would come up and get free examinations for whatever they got.  Something on their legs.  Something on their...  And this one guy had a bump on his gum line.  So the doctor put the glove on and he's feeling it. 
[01:28:30]  He goes, that's a hard lump.  That's not good.  He goes, you have this checked out immediately.  He goes, you smoke?  And the guy's like, yeah.  And the guy's...  And then we start talking about how he's going to look with half a jaw.  Well, the fear on that guy is like, oh God, just tell me what it is.  Tell me what it is.  I mean, it was supposed to be a fun bit and turn it to...  Jimmy quit.  That guy...  It was horrific.  And one doctor, just to add to this, punched out.  He's like, I don't want to be part of this.  Wow.  He saw what was in that guy's mouth and said, I'm done.  I don't want to be part of this.  The guy turned out to not have...  Right.  We found out a month later. 
[01:29:00]  But when he was trying to go, the guy was like saying, all right, where should I go?  What should I do?  And watching him try to hang on to his sanity, I'm like, that is exactly what it looks like  when you find out you have mouth cancer.  Yeah.  I was like, that is exactly a moment.  Because the guy was trying to not panic.  And that's what freaked me out.  But it was panicking him.  Okay.  Where do I go?  What should I do?  Who should I go to check this out?  And just, you know, I want the best guy.  You ever stop smoking for a limited time because maybe you had something, you didn't know what 
[01:29:30]  it was, and you're like, uh-oh.  Uh-uh.  Nothing like that.  No.  No?  No, no.  I smoked nonstop.  Just set a date, you phony.  You did quit for six months.  I set a date.  You did quit for six months.  I quit for six months.  Why?  What spurred that?  I was working in Boston, and I went and saw the man rushing.  There was a guy up in Boston that...  I went to that guy.  I didn't work for me.  You want to see...  Huh?  No.  He's just a douche.  He doesn't work for anybody.  No, he works for a lot.  Shut up.  I went six months.  What's the man rushing?  He was some...  Some fucking flake.  Some fucking flake.  You call me a flake for conspiracy theories?  Some fucking commie pushes... 
[01:30:00]  Why did you throw my Aussie doll in the middle?  Anything we think somebody might love has to be destroyed.  That's right.  He broke my trophy on his dumb show.  That's right.  Holy shit.  His fucking Aussie doll.  There's a little Aussie thing that Stalker Patty gave me, and he just ripped it up and  Oh, things are going bad. 
[01:30:30]  She's the only person that emails me consistently.  Who's the man rushing?  So, Colin, when's your show on so I can be on again?  The man rushing is this fucking flaky douche in Boston, and you sit there, and he does  an energy thing over you, and supposedly makes you quit.  And I'm an asshole for thinking that fucking...  It worked for me, and...  Why did you go?  Yeah, that's really 21 years.  How about this?  Fuck your aunt.  She was ready to quit.  Yeah, well, if you're ready to quit, maybe that's a help.  That's really impressive.  Maybe that's a help. 
[01:31:00]  Maybe that's a fucking aunt.  You should do everything you can do.  I mean, you should...  What?  Yeah, get a patch, get hypnotized, do all of it.  Do you like the smoking, Bonnie?  Everything.  I love it.  I don't want him to quit.  Subconsciously wants him to die.  What'd you do?  What'd you do with Bonnie?  You can't even accuse him of that, because you know he has no money.  The false fortune.  It's really not fun to be around somebody who's quitting smoking, and I'm not looking for  How fun is he now?  How much fun to quit?  Did you ever smoke, Bonnie?  Ever?  Yes, I did.  You're dead.  It took me many tries to quit.  And you quit? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, so four years ago.  How long ago?  Four years.  You miss it?  Actually, at one point before I started dating Rich, I thought I might actually start again.  It's very rough when you hook up with a smoker, and you've quit for a while, because you just  pick it right back up again.  Well, she drinks and gets high every now and then, so that was hard, too.  Stop trying to even it up.  Maybe you can handle booze now.  No, I can't, I can't believe it.  Why don't me and you go to a, I know a smoker's thing next week, next Sunday we'll go, I'll 
[01:32:00]  go with you.  To a what, smoker's thing?  Yeah, like a smoker's meeting.  Next Sunday?  Yeah, Sunday night.  You're not working, stop acting like you go.  Wait, what's Sunday?  This Sunday?  Sunday coming up.  Yeah, I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town.  He doesn't even know where Sunday is anymore.  I'll be out of town, but I'll be out of town.  What, Sunday?  Sunday, what?  What, between Sunday and Monday?  No good.  No good.  And Colin, as much as after that Aussie doll thing, how I really don't want to admit  this, helped me more than anybody.  The thing he said to me, which I don't think he made up, but it was, he said to me, the  urge to quit, to smoke will pass whether you smoke or not. 
[01:32:30]  And that was as perfectly simplistic as I needed it.  Well, it's the same as drinking and getting drunk.  Shut up, stop trying to act like you, too, understand this.  You're still smoking, idiot.  Chris loves to be the expert on addiction.  He'll just jump in.  Oh, please.  Listen, you're such a guy.  Look at Bobby.  Guess what?  Every guy's like that.  No matter who you're married, you'd be miserable every time they open their mouth.  Boss, are you going to the Freedom Center? 
[01:33:00]  What the fuck is the Freedom Center?  That's the laser therapy thing.  First of all, when somebody goes, what the fuck?  You're not doing it.  Huh?  It's Staten Island.  Welcome to Freedom Laser Therapy.  What does lasers do to make you stop smoking?  Freedom from smoking addiction.  It's Staten Island.  I don't know.  They'd probably make a good cigarette lighter.  He's done no research.  Light it up on a laser?  He's done no research on it.  None.  Someone said laser.  Someone said it to him.  Dummy thought technology.  It's the future.  No problem.  They'll take out that little cell that makes me smoke.  Oh, stupid.  He thinks they're going to do some kind of brain thing. 
[01:33:30]  I think it was Dave Wardow that I told you about it.  What's the gimmick here?  They don't really explain.  Oh, good.  It's vague.  It's lasers and it's vague.  Low-level laser therapy.  Hold on.  I think I have a...  You don't have to wear contacts anymore.  They use some kind of Jedi mind shit on you.  You don't need that cigarette anymore.  You have no need to smoke.  You'll feel great.  It's Sunday when you get back in town.  We'll go to a place.  Here we go.  Here we go.  We got Tyler in Columbus.  Tyler for Rich Voss.  Hey.  Hey, you guys were just talking about that guy that had the big lump in his mouth from 
[01:34:00]  years ago.  Yeah.  My father-in-law got the big casino in his jaw and about a month ago he just had it removed.  He's about...  What are you, Voss?  About in your 40s?  Good call.  He's 85.  What did he have?  The big what?  His cancer.  The big casino.  Oh.  I thought he had like Caesars or Bounties.  No, he's a...  Actually, I can't see his mouth.  White.  No headphones?  And...  For Rich? 
[01:34:30]  For Rich.  For Colin.  Why would there be headphones for somebody that's in studio with us?  Look.  Why?  Why would we have that?  Colin actually took a toilet paper tube to his ear and he put it to Rich's head.  There's a great photo of him.  He's hearing the C.  That's wacky.  That's wacky.  Wait.  So he had his whole jaw removed, not the tumor?  Yeah.  They had to take his...  The cancer spread through actually the bone in his jaw.  There you go.  There you go, Voss.  I look forward to some of that, maybe.  And actually the veins and everything in his jaw and they had to remove the whole damn 
[01:35:00]  thing and rebuild it.  They took like hip from...  Or bone from his hip and skin from his chest and legs and made him a new jaw, but he's  all...  Hey, Voss, stop it.  Dude, this guy's telling...  I know.  This guy right now...  I just a million of these stories.  If I'm not fucking ready, I know.  Yeah, by the way, caller, you know what?  During your story, Rich was checking his bookings on his Palm Pilot thing.  No, I was trying to...  He's not even...  No, I was trying to find the quit smoking thing right here and I found the link, the  website or whatever. 
[01:35:30]  No, I mean people...  Yeah.  Right next to the link to buy cigarettes online.  People can say quit smoking and all that shit, but it's like, you know, when you see  it, like I'm sitting across the room from the guy and it's like tongues, his dead tongue,  his tongue died.  They had to remove that too.  So like 80%.  That wouldn't be so bad.  All right, there's an upside to the whole thing.  But wait a second.  Was that from smoking?  Yeah, it was from smoking.  Or chewing tobacco?  No, he didn't chew.  They said he got the cancer from...  They told him he was going to cancer his mouth from smoking. 
[01:36:00]  Find another way to justify it.  Yeah.  Filterless?  Yeah.  That doll?  Yeah.  One hundreds.  Is he a Christian?  Plus, it's not going to help those tombstones you call teeth, you know, they're turning  gray from smoking.  All right, Tyler.  All right, I'm going to...  Here's what I'm going to do.  I'm sorry you didn't get the reaction you were looking for.  Yeah.  No, he's got a point, which is Voss has to have the guts to go to a cancer war.  We better get a car crash, so it's all good.  No, you're fine.  Thanks.  All right.  You know what I'm going to do?  April 22nd.  Why April? 
[01:36:30]  That's a good idea.  Why are you picking a date?  He's supposed to pick a date.  Is that it?  I've done all that stuff.  I just quit.  I once was just like Rich Voss.  Really?  I tried it all.  The mad Russian.  All of them.  Well, here's where Rich is going.  Oh, the laser thing?  Now, what do they do?  It's a therapy you can't even pronounce.  Oriculoral therapy.  That's why I was picking.  Oricul...  It's the one word he can't pronounce.  Is it something like ocular?  A-U-R.  A-U-R.  It's natural.  A-U-R.  A-U-R.  What do they go through your ear? 
[01:37:00]  I-C-U-L-O therapy.  Auricular.  Auricular.  All right, there you go.  Wait a minute.  If this involves your fucking ear...  Here we go.  What is it?  It's a non-invasive form of acupuncture.  No needles.  It utilizes a minor electrical impulse to stimulate acupuncture points in the outer ear.  I did that one, too.  I did that one, too.  It didn't work.  Really?  Don't be asked.  Why do you think a laser beam in your ear is going to stop you from smoking?  It might stop the cysts that are on the back of my ear.  It's going to start boiling the cyst, and the doctor's going to drop dead. 
[01:37:30]  I'm surprised you could get the lights out.  I thought the, you know, the wetness would put your cigarettes out immediately.  I know.  Bits them out.  This technique's been used for pain, addictions, and a host of many other dysfunctions.  I did it.  It didn't work.  How have you done it?  It's new.  I did it.  They didn't have it back then.  It's new.  I did it.  It's new.  It was the acupuncture.  You know how stupid Voss is?  It says around the website that they've been doing this since 500 B.C. in China. 
[01:38:00]  I haven't checked the website out yet.  It's new.  Like gunpowder.  What are you, a pterodactyl shit?  Your ads may be, but...  They invented the wheel and then this technique the next day, but it's new to Voss.  The newest thing since the stone tool.  Fucking Voss.  I haven't actually gone to the website yet.  It's new.  Forget about it.  It's right there in 500 B.C. in China. 
[01:38:30]  I hiped you to acupuncture.  I'm talking about what to get, like, acupuncture.  Norm MacDonald goes, you know, that's great stuff because I was injured.  He goes, they've used that for millions of years in China.  Yeah.  I go, yeah.  He goes, yeah, then they invented medicine.  So they didn't have to use it.  You guys that are always on the TV quote each other?  What?  I wish I had a car.  I don't want to use the car crash.  I want a clip of him lighting up. 
[01:39:00]  What did Kevin Nealon have to say about it?  We're broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony hosted by myself, Rich Voss.  I got to slow down when I send my name so I don't fucking slobber through it.  It sucks having a name where some of the letters, you have a speech impediment in your name.  We have more of the stupid shit coming up after the break.  All right, we're back. 
[01:39:30]  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hold on.  I can't do this with fucking gum in my mouth.  I am addicted to this fucking nicotine gum.  I'm Rich Voss and we're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You'll be listening to Rich Voss Quit Smoking Part 2.  Hold on.  Let me read this and see what they're going to.  You know, this is all a surprise to me.  I don't remember all this stuff.  So I got to look it over so it'll refresh my memory.  Oh, really? 
[01:40:00]  Voss said that.  I mean, Danny said that I should.  What it is is when you are an addict, sometimes you replace one addiction with another.  And, you know, people do it all the time.  They quit getting high.  They go to gambling.  They quit drinking.  They go to eating, whatever, dah, dah, dah, you know, it's whatever.  And I guess Danny, if you listen, made a success.  He offered some advice on what I should do to replace smoking, which was ridiculous. 
[01:40:30]  And then I think Danny, well, if you listen, might have said something about the way, talk  about my appearance, you know, and I think I look pretty good.  Uh, I know when I'm masturbating in the mirror, uh, it's not a bad sight.  You know what I'm saying?  Some people, when they masturbate in the mirror, uh, will only look down.  You know what I mean?  At their penis through the mirror.  I'll look at my whole self.  You know what I mean? 
[01:41:00]  Sometimes when I jerk off, I look, turn my ass to the mirror and look at my ass because  that's how tight it is.  I don't know if this is too personal, but I, I have a nice ass.  I'm not going to lie.  Uh, some guys have big, you know what I'm saying, but I got a nice ass and girls like  a nice ass too.  They girls do.  They go, Oh, he's got a nice ass.  You know what I mean?  So, so, you know what?  That's one of my better qualities is I got a nice ass and I'm not a chubby at all.  What kind of chubby?  Sometimes when you just let it all drop out, it could be a mess, but no one does that in 
[01:41:30]  public.  Take a listen.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  So the smoking thing, did you go and smoke?  No, just now I went to the bathroom.  Can I tell you what happened?  He told everyone at the, when we were at the Mitch Hedberg tribute, he told everyone the  day before that he was going to quit smoking the next day because it was really close after  we come into the studio and you guys were bugging him. 
[01:42:00]  I knew it was wrong for you to tell everyone, but I was excited.  I wanted it to be true and the day that he was supposed to quit, he, within 20 minutes,  was smoking after he got up.  He goes, I'm going to do it tomorrow and then tomorrow.  You're never going to quit.  I said, you couldn't even go 20 minutes and he was like, I didn't get up in the middle  of the night to smoke though and I wanted to.  So that was his life.  So that's a good start, right?  Rich, you're wrapped up in terror.  You feel like you're losing a part of yourself and you're not. 
[01:42:30]  You know.  Shut your mouth.  You're afraid you're going to lose a piece of yourself.  I think he thinks it's going to be too hard.  Like he won't even try.  He's afraid.  He's terrified of losing that one last escape.  Why don't you put a patch on and do something healthier?  Get prostitutes.  Do anything that isn't going to have your, no offense.  Give your wife eggs.  I don't care what it is.  I'm saying you're going to take a piece of your jaw out.  What's the matter with you, dude?  I mean, if I could quit, I love to smoke. 
[01:43:00]  I mean, I used to smoke more, but I loved it and I quit.  You could quit.  It doesn't bother him.  You know who it bothers?  Me.  Yeah.  It's like I see that commercial with the guy.  Oh, swabbing his throat.  Yeah.  Will you still be doing comedy when you have a voice box there?  I'll probably get on Last Comic 7 because they're using all handicaps anyhow.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Jesus Christ.  The one guy with the left crooked arm.  He's funny though, man.  He is funny.  He's really funny.  I'm going to tell you something.  Hey, we got to look into your future right here.  This is a look into Rich Voss's future. 
[01:43:30]  Hi, I'm Rich Voss.  You want to buy a dryer?  Door.  I owe my daughter money and I'm dodging her.  Actually, she's dodging me.  She's disgusted at the vagina that is my throat now.  Oh, as he starts.  Yeah.  Laughing and then coughing.  Listen.  You got to get off the cigarette.  Let's see when it happens.  Didn't you know?  Chris, what's going on? 
[01:44:00]  Not much.  How's it going, boy?  All right.  What do you got?  Listen to this.  Go ahead.  Well, Voss, I've never heard of anybody actually waking up in the middle of the night craving  a cigarette.  That's pretty weird.  He's one of the most addicted people I've ever met and he refuses to acknowledge the fucking  terror he feels at the discomfort of quitting smoking.  It's not as bad as you think.  Just get the patch and drink a lot of water.  It's possible.  It's just fear.  It's terror.  Our own Danny's quitting.  Is he?  Derek, too. 
[01:44:30]  Derek, too?  How's Danny doing with the smoking?  Oh, yeah.  Danny is quitting.  I've been smoking even through the military and stuff like that and I've never had to wake  up in the middle of the night and have a cigarette.  A little lonely.  A little lonely for Travis down there, downstairs, puffing away all by himself these days.  He's standing there like fucking John Voight in Midnight Cowboy.  Guys are trying to get him to suck their dicks in a movie.  I don't do that.  That's smoking fin shit. 
[01:45:00]  It's for Jackie's.  Robert in Birmingham.  Robert.  Yeah, hey guys.  Hey.  The problem is Voss doesn't see any consequences of not stopping smoking.  I mean, cancer is just a theoretical thing.  Yes.  Bonnie just needs to tell him that she's going to leave his ass if he doesn't quit.  I tell him that every day and then he gives me $100 and I wipe off her back.  Tyler in Columbus.  Tyler.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, first of all, I want to welcome you guys back to the big wazoo. 
[01:45:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Fuck the funny bones.  They wouldn't book me.  Where's the big wazoo?  I've been there.  Columbus.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Fuck suckers.  Anyway, I just want to give Voss a little update on my father-in-law.  He got his jaw removed.  See, this doesn't bother him.  It bothers me.  I can't take it.  Why?  Did you know his father?  No.  I love that man.  Sorry I didn't hear that one, Bonnie.  That was a good one.  That was funny.  How is he feeling? 
[01:46:00]  Well, you're not going to have on me, are you?  What's that?  Okay.  Never mind.  He's doing not too bad.  He slobbers all over himself.  Oh, well, I don't want to do that.  Voss does already.  He's got about half his jaw.  Oh, God.  And they actually put it in, and the skin died and everything.  And then they had to remove it and start all over again.  Oh, God. 
[01:46:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Yeah, I laughed too, man.  I used to smoke, and I said, you know, I don't give a shit because he, you know, he did what  he did, and he wouldn't quit smoking, and he's paying for it now.  So, that's...  Rich is just lying to the people he loves.  His wife and his daughters, who he loves.  He promises and promises, and he lies to their faces.  Now, how does this guy chew food now?  He actually has a tube inserted in his stomach, and he has a little cup attached to the end 
[01:47:00]  of the tube, and he just pours his liquefied dinner into the tube.  Well, that sounds tasty.  Coconut shrimp in a blender.  Coconut shrimp in a blender.  Can you imagine?  Bonnie's going to be the one that has to take care of him like that.  Oh, yeah, dude.  You got it.  Is there such a thing as an intervention for smoking?  Bonnie, could you...  Oh, gosh.  Bonnie.  He's hard enough to look at.  Bonnie, could you blend me up some shrimp cocktail and pour it in my food? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, God.  With a clear feed bag on the bottom so the drool and stuff leaks into it.  I got to say this.  He can talk.  You can kind of understand him if he puts his finger over his trach tube.  Oh.  You see, you're going to lose your profession.  That means something to you.  Yeah, slobbery dryer door, Jeff.  Without a jaw, old claw hammer face.  Oh, too good, man.  Too good.  Can somebody call him?  Yeah.  That's like, I've been smoking and drinking my whole life. 
[01:48:00]  I'll tell you, how I got to 99 is smoking, drinking whiskey and women.  So does your father-in-law try to look at the bright side like he's saving a lot on Mach 3s?  He's got a Mach 1 1⁄2.  Oh, my God.  That's why there's a pretty pricey, though.  Grow a real long mustache to try to comb over.  Like a walrus.  It looks like a beard.  Oh, you grow the old taft mustache. 
[01:48:30]  Don't make a joke about it.  Oh, yeah.  You're not alone.  Oh, look.  The body's telling him, don't make a joke about it.  Yeah.  He's going to start joking about it.  You take it seriously.  We can joke about it.  Not you.  You can't scare someone into quitting because Rich sees something that's never going to happen to him.  First of all, you don't think I'm going to quit at some point?  No.  No.  You've said it too many times.  You just lied.  I didn't say you lied.  I said it June 30th on my birthday.  Shut up.  You said that your last birthday.  Yeah.  And then you didn't even.  And you gave it 20 minutes. 
[01:49:00]  You said five and a half weeks ago.  Yeah.  You've been saying.  There's a guy that decided to do it.  Five and a half.  Well, let's talk to Rich.  Rich in New York.  Go ahead.  What's your story?  I quit the same day Rich was supposed to quit live on the air.  I've been wearing the patch for five and a half weeks.  Now, Voss, you've got kids.  Fucking quit.  How hard was it?  If you don't, you're going to quit someday, the day they plant dirt in your face.  Oh.  You don't think I'm going to be able to afford a box?  Is that what you're saying?  I didn't see that coming.  Save your curtain tops. 
[01:49:30]  Danny.  Danny.  I haven't asked him lately, but Danny, quit smoking?  Yeah.  Are you still?  How are you doing with that?  Doing all right with it.  Cool, man.  How long?  Just over two weeks.  Cold turkey or you got a patch?  No, I got the patch.  It works, right?  It helps.  It absolutely helps.  Do you drink or smoke pot or anything?  Do you have any addictions?  Well, I was drinking a lot more when I was smoking.  You put the patch on your balls, right?  No.  Put it over your asshole.  Got it on right now.  Oh, there it is.  I was showing Rich before.  He's like, does it work? 
[01:50:00]  Of course it works.  First of all, you fucking clipboard jockey, don't you ever try to abuse me, okay?  You jackass.  You get me coffee when I tell you, okay?  That's what you do with me.  I think he's great on that one.  Turn around.  Now, what do you put on?  One or two a day?  Just one.  Yeah?  How many did you smoke?  How long did you smoke for?  I was smoking for 10 years.  He's trying to show you that you don't understand his dilemma because he smokes more and has been  smoking longer.  That's why he's asking.  Where in the shower?  Because I shower. 
[01:50:30]  You can wear it in the shower as a matter of fact.  Of course you can.  Wouldn't that be odd if you got a little circular cancer of the arm?  Yeah.  And it spread and paralyzed you and we all just laughed.  Why do you put it there when you have so much room on your forehead to put it?  You fucking...  Misplaced anger!  Rich, you're going to want to replace the smoking with something.  I'm going to suggest a lot of fruit and veggies for you.  That was your comeback?  Yes.  Listen to me, fucking Green Goblin from Spider-Man Face.  What did that mean?  It means that he's fucking chubby. 
[01:51:00]  I'm chubby?  He's chubby!  Oh!  You're going to take that, Rich!  What?  Wow!  I'm chubby?  Let's see...  Show him your abs, Rich.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Rich is the fucking...  I don't know...  You look fat with clothes and skinny without...  I've never seen that before.  I'm fucking 49 years old and I'm ripped, okay?  He's hot.  His gut looks better.  His gut looks much better.  Those are tumors.  Those are tumors.  All the less that the surgeons are going to have to cut through to get to your lungs.  You're just lucky they'd form into something.  I had the sack taken out of the back of my ear if you want to see the stickers. 
[01:51:30]  Thank God, no.  No, we don't.  All right.  Keep that to yourself.  Danny's doing well with it.  Good for you, Danny.  Good for you, Danny.  Let's play the throat cancer commercials again.  And they horrify Bonnie, right?  Do I look fat?  Do I look fat?  This guy is...  Oh, Jesus, you woman.  This guy is on every time you turn the TV on now.  It's the Spanish guy.  They show him getting ready in the morning.  He swabs out his blowhole with a Q-tip and it's unwatchable.  Unwatchable. 
[01:52:00]  And now they have a new one where he walks around a pool and talks about how he used to  enjoy his swimming and now if he went into the pool, he would drown.  Yeah, but see, here's the thing.  This guy was a spot welder, but now he's doing TV, so...  He's seeing it as an upward career move.  You think he's happy that he gets recognized, like, all happy?  Hey, you're a cancer guy.  Sign my hole.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  What are you coming over to look at? 
[01:52:30]  To distract from the fact that you just bombed?  I had some good ones today.  I might have one or two bad ones.  You had a couple of real stingers.  You could have the patch on right now, just drinking water, and when you jones, it goes  away.  All right, here's...  It goes away.  Here's the second...  Oh, God.  ...cancer kazoo commercial.  I was born on an island where swimming was a way of life.  I never thought that anything could hit me from the water.  Then I got throat cancer from a smoking cigarette and lost my voice. 
[01:53:00]  Now I have to drink to a hole in my throat.  If water gets inside, it will drown me.  I used to love swimming.  I used to love swimming.  I used to love swimming.  He's not good on a rap.  Like...  I thought we blew him up last night.  Some hip-hop.  In fact...  Yeah, Al's our cow.  We quit smoking.  No, I think the joke is he's still smoking. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, he's still smoking.  That's the one.  Yeah, Rich, you gotta stop.  I'm good.  I'm telling you.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  You stop giving you nothing.  We've given you a month and a year.  I've been hearing this for a year.  I remember Rich quit for six months.  Shut up.  Years ago, he quit for six months.  Yeah.  Yes.  When I was still smoking.  You can do it.  I still don't believe that, by the way.  You weren't with him all the time.  No, but I believe you.  I don't think you would have lied.  I told you.  He's a groveling nothing, but he's not really a liar.  He's been lying about quitting.  No, I've been in denial.  I haven't been lying.  No, you haven't lied.  What's the difference?  You're lying to your wife and children that you're going to do something that you know you're 
[01:54:00]  not going to do.  I didn't tell my kids I was quitting.  I might have told her.  You've got kids?  I don't know.  Bonnie's killing today.  That's right.  She's funny, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you, Rich.  Would you just pull out a cigarette?  No, my money's clipped.  Oh.  Why don't you just throw your cigarettes out?  Throw them out right now.  Why don't you just tough it out?  Yeah, let's do it.  Yeah, throw them right now.  Right now.  What's the worst that's going to happen?  What's the worst that's going to happen?  Yeah.  Nothing's worse that's going to happen.  You'll live through it. 
[01:54:30]  I mean.  So what are you saying?  Stop being so afraid.  I'll quit.  Just throw them away.  Okay.  No, not one more.  That was what I did.  He did.  He had one more.  I had one more that day.  You're going to have one more, and you're going to quit today.  There's no good to quit in the middle of the day.  Yes, it is.  I did.  I quit on Friday night going to the cellar.  I had to perform.  I did three shows that night.  He needs a perfect time and place to quit.  Yeah, what?  Do you have to wake up one day and just want to be cigarette free?  No.  Shut up.  It's never going to happen.  Esty took me over.  I did three sets that night.  You could still smoke in the cellar.  She took me over, and I just put the patch on.  You did three sets? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Not all on your face.  No.  I don't know.  I'll quit today.  See, I think he should even just get a patch, get hypnotized, get some gum.  Is it good?  Do all of it.  Everything at once.  Yeah, just do it.  I mean, whatever it takes to help you quit.  Then when I quit, then you guys are going to have nothing on me.  Oh, we'll still have plenty.  You'll still have a little pee-pee.  No.  He does, and he has a...  Rich has a great cock.  Almost died.  Rich has a great cock. 
[01:55:30]  His wife is right there, and Jim's got to vouch for Rich's cock.  He carries photos of it.  Yeah, no shit.  It's great that you and Barney have something to bond with.  I mean, we've unfortunately all seen his picture.  Broadcast of the worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss.  Hey, it's Voss.  If you need any, go to my website, richvoss.com, myspace.com slash richvoss, twitter.com slash richvoss. 
[01:56:00]  Mainly my website.  I don't know.  Just come out and see a fucking show.  That's all I'm saying.  I shouldn't have cursed that, sorry.  Richvoss.com.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Rich Voss.  I'm Rich Voss, and we're back.  We're the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I hope you guys took care of everything you had to during your little break there, because  we got some funny shit coming up.  Oh, this is, this fucking worst of is the whole day on me?  No one's going to listen to that. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, they will.  I fucking carry this show sometimes.  Okay?  Believe you me.  You don't think I sometimes say a thing on purpose to get reaction to build, huh?  What did I say today that I knew I was saying wrong, but I still did it as a team player?  Uh, I don't think anything.  I think they were all complete fuck-ups.  What did I say?  Benedict Arnold?  What is it?  You said Benedict Arnold.  Yeah, Benedict Arnold.  What is it? 
[01:57:00]  Benedict Arnold.  Benedict.  That's what I said.  Benedict.  Benedict.  Oh, dict.  CT at the end.  Oh, not a K.  So many people get so upset when you fucking take away the CT and add a K. Saves you time.  That's all I'm saying.  One letter instead of two.  Right here, uh, if you listen to this, this, I'm not going to fucking lie.  I've had a couple blunders in my life, a couple mistakes, okay?  Uh, now, uh, one's in college and the other one's going to graduate. 
[01:57:30]  But, uh, this was one of my biggest mistakes.  Uh, if you listen, you'll see what I did.  And, um, believe you me, I paid for this mistake.  I paid and I learned a lesson.  Uh, that ONA listeners don't let anything get by them.  I'm telling you within a fucking second of any, do you know what ONA listeners, you know  what you guys are like?  You're like fucking sharks. 
[01:58:00]  You really are.  You're like out of shape sharks, but you're sharks.  And you're, or vultures, or you see a weakness or you see a mistake.  And, but within seconds, boom, you just swoop in or you attack, you know, you can't really  swoop in or attack quick, but you try, you know what I mean?  Uh, but you guys don't miss a fucking thing.  It's unbelievable.  You don't miss a thing.  Anyhow, this is one of my blunders.  Wow.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:58:30]  Rich Voss.  Here you go for Rich Voss.  Uh, richvoss.com.  Uh, Rich Voss on MySpace.  Yeah.  What's your, what's your Twitter thing?  I don't fucking Twitter.  Rich Voss.  Twitter.  I don't know how you do that.  What do you mean you don't Twitter?  I Twitter all the time.  I got fucking, I love it.  So I'm asking you what you're.  Wait, you just said you don't know how to do that.  No, I don't know, you can give a Twitter address?  Nobody, nobody acknowledged you talked.  I don't know.  No promotion for your Twitter today.  Twitter Rich Voss, I guess.  No, it's not that.  What is it? 
[01:59:00]  It's certainly not that.  Did you pick a name when you signed up for Twitter?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh my God.  Don't, you know what?  You don't get the promotion for your Twitter.  Comic 630.  That's your Twitter name?  I think so.  Comic 630.  Why?  What's wrong with you?  What do you mean what's wrong with you?  You put your profession?  You're aging, your age, and then a zero.  How about you work off the name Rich Voss?  How about you work off the name Rich Voss?  Maybe Rich Voss is taken, so you do Rich Voss asshole.  Would it say on here? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, maybe it is.  Maybe it is Rich Voss.  He doesn't know.  What's the Comic 630 thing?  You're still using a stylus?  Obviously, you're not.  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  He does a lot.  Game on today.  He does lob them back at you, Jim.  Game on today.  You came prepared.  Is that Rich Voss?  Why are you using a...  No, it's not.  I don't think.  It's Rich Voss VLS.  Why are you using a fucking...  Stylus. 
[02:00:00]  Could some...  Remember the stylus?  Why...  Get a fucking tap screw.  What are you doing with that thing?  My fingers are too nubby to tap shit on...  I might end up breaking the glass.  Did you get that on eBay?  No.  You're finally buying stuff in stores?  Yeah.  That's good.  Nubby fingers.  That's an improvement.  I just put a golf bag on eBay.  Improvement.  Hey, maybe a fan could call up and tell everyone what Rich Voss' Twitter thing is.  Because Rich really doesn't know.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Rich Voss in studio. 
[02:00:30]  We're trying to get to the bottom of his Twitter thing.  Someone, by the way, Rich, is saying that you do the worst tweets ever.  Oh.  And by the way, your stupidity...  It goes beyond reason.  Your stupidity just continues to amaze.  You know what you did.  Jimmy doesn't even have an idea.  You both were out of the studio, right?  What is your Twitter name?  Like, if someone wants to see your Twitter, what would they have to type in to see your Twitter? 
[02:01:00]  Wait till you hear this one, Jimmy.  What is your Twitter name?  Rich Voss.  So you can go to www.twitter.com slash Rich Voss.  And you can start following Rich Voss.  Okay, so what was the thing you said earlier?  And what was the thing earlier?  Oh.  What was the comic thing?  I don't know.  Don't say it because it might be something else.  Oh, it might be?  No, it is something else.  No, it is.  And everyone fucking picked up on it. 
[02:01:30]  And they are hacking the shit out of your Twitter site right now.  Rich Voss gave out his password for his Twitter account.  That comic thing that he gave out earlier?  That was his password.  And lucky, most step from Kentucky now owns your Twitter.  And it said, look at the big post he put.  He gave his password.  What an idiot.  Rich.  I didn't even know Twitter had a password.  So some dude from Kentucky now controls your Twitter.  Oh, that's hysterical. 
[02:02:00]  Wow, you are as dumb as they call it.  Kentucky, can you twit that I'll be at Marco Island next week?  Now he just sees it as some guy that he's hired to.  I'm glad I got somebody running my shit fucking out.  I'm just getting tired of these little twits.  You're getting tired of trying to come up with clever tweets?  It's hysterical.  Can you put a new...  I don't want to lose all the people I'm following.  It's not yours anymore.  Unless this guy does the right thing and gives it back to you.  All the people.  You have 3,000 people that follow you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Opie's got over 30,000.  Oh, really?  The guy on the radio has over 30,000? 
[02:02:30]  And I have...  Hold on, guys.  Hold on.  You're the guy on the radio right now.  He gives out the address.  You give out the password.  Oh, wait.  It's little Nicky.  Let's all look at little Nicky.  He's got a suitcase today.  He's got a suitcase.  He's rolling a suitcase down the hall.  Hi, little Nicky.  All right.  Back to Rich Voss.  So, Rich, we do that.  We love when little Nicky comes by.  He's late today.  It's usually 820.  I know.  It is a little late.  Rich.  Voss gave out his fucking ass.  How great is that?  That is typical Voss. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, man.  Hey, Rich.  Wow.  Wait.  This guy's trying to call in.  I think...  Oh, wait.  We might have the guy.  Who's this?  This is Mo Step from Kentucky.  Hey, Mo Step, if it's really you, how about you tweet, I'm Rich Voss and I suck cocks.  Yeah, go ahead.  Do that.  Do a lie.  I love this.  Can you do that?  You big Jew nose, you're pathetic. 
[02:03:30]  I'm pathetic?  Listen, big nose.  Actually, he has to come up with a tweet.  Say it on our show and do it at the same time and that'll prove that you have control  of Rich Voss' Twitter account.  Change his picture to something really stupid.  Find something on Google like a big dick.  It already is.  I'm a very good-looking man. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, shit.  If I was...  Jimmy wants a hug.  No, put something awful up there.  No.  Oh, look at that.  Put a picture of him.  See?  No, he wrote, Jimmy wants a hug.  Jimmy wants a hug.  This guy has your account.  Yeah, he's got your account, dude.  That is fantastic.  I'm going to save you, Voss, okay?  Really?  Are you booking improvs?  Hey, did you change the password?  I couldn't book you, buddy.  What's that?  Rowan couldn't get you a gig. 
[02:04:30]  Did you change the password?  Yes, I did.  He did right away.  That's stupid.  What's that?  What did he do?  He changed your password.  To what?  He's not telling you.  Yeah, to what?  Let's say it again.  Yeah, let him blurt it out so someone else can take it now.  It looks like a good guy's got your account, so...  Who's this guy right here?  Yeah, he seems like he's all right.  I'm sure he'll, on hold, he'll give the password to Travis and he'll give it back to you.  But in the meantime, yeah, write, I'm Rich Voss, I love cock. 
[02:05:00]  Cut.  Make sure it's cut.  Actually, I'm Rich Voss would just fucking cover that.  I'm Rich Voss, I love black cock.  Can you put a space between my name?  No, stupid, it's just like your account name.  Oh, okay.  Listen, don't call me stupid.  With that accent, we're going to try to build a relationship, you and I.  With that accent, he got your password and now runs your fucking Twitter site. 
[02:05:30]  Hey, can you update my MySpace and my Facebook?  Why don't you get that password out over the air?  Those are numbers.  I don't even know those.  This is going to work in your favor.  Now people are going to want to follow you to see what this guy from Kentucky writes for you.  You should let him have it for a few days.  All right.  It's a good promotion for you.  Rich Voss, one word on Twitter to see what Moss Def.  And it's one S.  A lot of people spell it with two.  Yeah, I know.  Really?  Yeah.  Leave off the last S for failure. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, we know what that S is for.  Exactly.  Moss, hold on the line, all right?  That's the password for everything.  What do you mean for everything?  They said, don't even look at his MySpace account.  Oh, no.  Do you use one password for everything?  Oh, go to his MySpace.  This is too good.  And it has to be said on the radio because the feedback is ridiculous.  Rich, read what I wrote.  They pretty much got a hold of your bank accounts at this point. 
[02:06:30]  Not on any of that stuff.  Read what I wrote to you on this paper silently, out loud.  Yeah.  Can you read that?  Yeah.  Into the mic.  What do you mean?  Read it out loud?  Yeah.  May 22nd, 23rd.  No, no.  What I wrote.  Change your email, password, et cetera.  I wrote that after he gave out that, after that came out because I know he has the same  password.  He must have the same password for everything.  Oh, my God.  No, I don't.  Not for Facebook, I don't think.  Oh, yes, you do.  Oh, really? 
[02:07:00]  Wait, Travis.  Travis, what the fuck?  And you know what?  Here's the thing.  They got control of your Facebook, your Twitter, and your MySpace.  Good.  Maybe they'll fucking help me.  I'm getting tired of doing this shit anyhow.  Let's see his Facebook.  Let's see.  Let's see what they did to it.  Quick, change my password.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  If I'm your friend, Rich, I don't know.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  Oh, Rich.  What the fuck?  Oh, God.  Let's see.  Rich Moss.  And it's coming up. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, wait.  He didn't do anything.  Hold on.  What?  He didn't do anything yet, so.  Okay.  Who owns Rich's Facebook page now?  Travis does?  Travis nailed it.  Why?  Why?  Because you gave out your password.  Not for Facebook.  It's not the same one for Facebook.  Travis?  Well, MySpace isn't the same.  Well, it's not the same now.  Okay, but MySpace wasn't, my password wasn't down on MySpace.  Oh, my God. 
[02:08:00]  The Bobby Kelly things are annoying me.  They should be, right?  Oh, God.  Yeah, change something, Travis.  Go ahead.  Have some fun with it.  How about the mood?  Yes.  Yes.  Change his mood.  Feeling like a toothy retard.  Jesus, Rich.  What's the matter with you?  Rich is feeling dumb.  I'm not feeling dumb at all.  We didn't pick up on the fact that he was giving out his password.  It was such an obvious password type word, and none of us picked up on it. 
[02:08:30]  Wow.  Who are you calling?  My web guy.  I am a toothy retard.  There it is.  What's that on?  Facebook.  That's your Facebook.  Oh, maybe that is the same thing.  It's now been hacked.  Yep, it is.  Wow.  Brilliant.  Fucking Rich.  We got to do a little back and forth, because Rich Voss's Twitter is now promoting Jimmy  Norton, and it's Scott in Quakertown. 
[02:09:00]  I see Rich Voss is now following Britney Spears.  I always was.  Look at what he's trying to do there.  That last picture.  Oh, was that infuriating.  Oh, my God.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He did it.  What happened?  Rich just got a Facebook password reset confirmation to his Black Mary.  Who owns my Facebook?  Travis?  Oh, he's not a bad guy.  I'm sure he is.  Really? 
[02:09:30]  Not a guy.  Have you ever hung out with him?  Let's say hi to Anonymous.  Anonymous.  Anonymous.  Anonymous.  Hey, Bob.  Hello.  It's Jimmy.  Bob.  Wait, wait.  Rich Voss's Twitter picture is now Jim Norton in his underwear.  Oh, what a fucking idiot he is.  He gave out his password on the radio.  That's why we're talking to Anonymous. 
[02:10:00]  Anonymous.  What's up, Anonymous?  Hey, Voss.  Voss ran out of the studio.  He's in a panic mode.  He's on a cell phone.  What do you got, Anonymous?  He just bought 400 hotel tickets from Priceline.com.  Oh, no.  Was that his Priceline?  Holy shit.  Oh, they're going to kill this guy.  What do you have?  One password for everything. 
[02:10:30]  You can't do that.  You don't have one password ever.  Those Bobby pictures are fucking huge.  Who needs 9,000 by 4,000 resolution?  Oh, my.  It's true.  You're right.  You're right.  He wants people to print them up.  He wants people.  His Twitter picture is hilarious.  Jimmy in his underwear pushing his gut out picture.  Oh, is that fantastic, man?  Is he following anybody stupid? 
[02:11:00]  Oh, I mean, himself.  Only he would fucking blurt out his password.  Holy shit.  What an idiot.  That is really, really funny.  Oof.  Goddamn Rich.  He's always good.  He's always fucking good.  He's not following me, by the way. 
[02:11:30]  Motherfucker.  Is he not following?  No, he's following Opie.  Oh, he's got to be following me.  He's not following me?  I've got to leave Bob Kelly a message.  Nope, he's not following me.  Well, go fuck yourself then.  Yeah, tell Rich to go fuck himself.  What's the matter?  Oh, boy.  Rich just made a face like, uh-oh.  Things okay, Rich?  You're making some calls.  You couldn't just come in and have a great appearance.  You're in the middle of a great appearance.  Something always has to go wrong with you.  Always.  You're making some phone calls, Rich.  You've got to talk to some people. 
[02:12:00]  I'm sorry that I made a mistake and gave out my password.  And how you do that is beyond me.  I'm amazed we didn't pick up on it.  How you just blurt your password out.  We didn't pick up on it.  Because who would think somebody would be...  Our audience knows Rich better than we do.  They're like, that idiot just gave out his password.  And we're just sitting here going, that's not your name, stupid.  And everyone else picked up on, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Think of the first guy that typed it in and went, click. 
[02:12:30]  Holy shit.  Holy shit, it is.  Oh, shit.  But at least that's not my password for my password.  I don't even care about my password.  Someone just bought a Rolls Royce on eBay.  Paid for it with PayPal.  Rich is leaving the room again with his phone.  His eyes got big when you read that in.  No, I don't even...  Why don't you go make some phone calls? 
[02:13:00]  He put the picture.  Of him with his eyes shut.  They are fucking up all your pages, dude.  They just put the worst Rich Voss picture ever on his Facebook.  Rich, good news though.  You gained 200 followers.  I actually took that photo.  People are following you.  Yeah, that's the photo I took of Richard.  Original Jim photo.  Oh, Sam's running in.  No, he's running somewhere else. 
[02:13:30]  What the fuck is he doing?  All right.  Wow, that is...  It's beyond me.  It's beyond me that someone could do that.  There might be a Rich Voss update.  What do you mean?  Give it a second.  What?  Oh.  What's that?  Why is Sam laughing?  Oh, no, boys.  Guess who has his email address?  You?  You?  Yes.  His email is the same one? 
[02:14:00]  Oh, no.  Send out a mass email.  I'm actually glad.  I was worried about his email.  I'm actually glad that...  Yeah, that's one of our idiots.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what I was worried about.  Oh, fuck.  God.  The stupidity in this guy is just amazing.  It's just...  It's astounding.  I would never give out...  Like, you know your passwords.  Dude, mine...  You just don't ever blurt them out like that. 
[02:14:30]  I couldn't even blurt mine out.  I wouldn't know how to pronounce it.  Because he actually fucking...  Put?  Fuck you.  Oh, shit.  But I've been working on it.  Oh, that's crazy.  That's funny.  Picture of Rich.  It's so utterly bad.  I know. 
[02:15:00]  Jim in Cleveland.  Jim.  Yeah.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  What's your name?  Oh, Jeremy.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  I just want to let you know I bought some dryer doors for Voss also.  Dry your door.  Put it out.  It could be one of the top...  That's one of the greatest things that's ever happened on the show.  One of the greatest dummy moments.  Voss dummy moments.  And there are so many of them.  Look at him marching down the hall trying to get things done now.  I've got to change my password to Louie Beans. 
[02:15:30]  I love Rich.  He's in a full pack.  Oh, he's pacing the hallway on that phone trying to shut everything down.  Damage control right now.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  It's going to make me laugh for weeks.  Yeah.  Not even for the day.  Weeks.  But that's why you never use the same name and password for everything.  Not because you're going to blurt it out on an international radio show. 
[02:16:00]  You never do.  I have a bunch of different ones.  Yeah.  Sometimes they get all fucked up.  You ever put in one username and then you can't remember which password you use?  I've forgotten them.  And then you've got to run through all of them.  And then you've got those sites that sometimes only allow you to do it three times before  it shuts it down for a half hour.  Yeah, I know.  And then you've got one last try and you're like, is this the one?  That's what happened to my phone recently.  Doink.  And then what happens?  Then they erase the whole phone.  Oh, you have a set like that?  Really?  It's a corporate phone and all of a sudden they change the password. 
[02:16:30]  I don't know.  And by the third time I watched that bar thing go wiping out everything.  What a nightmare that was.  His voice tweeted a lot recently.  All I see is my fat stomach on every one of his tweets.  It's great.  The picture of Jimmy's gut.  Please don't mess his thing up.  Just please promote something by getting on his Twitter. 
[02:17:00]  That makes me so happy.  He's getting so many followers, though, because of this.  Yeah.  It might work out for you in the end, Rich.  What do we got?  I got him.  I got him.  What do you mean you got him?  I got it.  It's mine now.  It's Danny's now.  Oh, so you got his Twitter?  All right.  Go to town, Danny.  Rich, you all right?  I've never seen you sweat.  Huh?  You are sweating, my friend.  Hold on, Ken.  We'll get to you in a sec.  What?  Yeah.  You all right there, Rich?  Well, you know, Comic 630 is me and my birthday. 
[02:17:30]  So you would think I'm a comic and I put my birthday.  It's easy to remember.  You were born in June?  I know.  No, in February, in February, and I'd like to add on a couple months.  That's exactly the year.  Wow, I am coming up so short.  Dammit.  Oh, that's funny.  But everything is done.  Hold on. 
[02:18:00]  I got it.  Everything is.  You all right now?  What?  Oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Thank you.  I lost his tweeting my dates.  Thank you.  I don't mind.  Look at your new picture.  Put your glasses on.  Norton in his horrendous underpants.  How do I take this back?  You don't.  You don't.  What do you mean I don't?  It's still mine.  I can still go on it myself.  You can.  Try going on your Twitter right now.  Go update it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No.  What happened? 
[02:18:30]  They got your password.  Look at the followers you're getting.  You're up to like 300, 400 new followers today because of this.  Full call.  Hey, Reese in Maryland, what's up?  Hey, guys, you've got to take a look at who he's following on Twitter now.  What's that?  Who's he following?  Who's he following?  Make him follow a bunch of rappers.  Okay, he's following me.  What is that?  Gay Times?  Gay Times Magazine.  Gay Times Magazine.  Gay Marriage Rights.  Gay Community. 
[02:19:00]  Angry Gay Guy.  Gay Civil Rights.  Adult Gay Sex Porn.  Gay Porn Stud.  Gay Rights Watch.  Gay.com.  Post Gay.  Big Gay News.  And I'll bet that the fans even added some.  You know, here's the thing.  Let the laughs continue. 
[02:19:30]  You were doing so well today, Rick.  I knew you would do something to blow it.  I didn't blow it.  How did I fucking blow it?  Let people know that I called it today.  How did I blow it?  It's still a good appearance.  What the fuck?  You know what?  No one's going to remember any of the lines you did today.  Tell me about how stupid you are.  Rick, you had a great appearance.  But let me tell you something.  When you left the room before, Opie turns around and goes, Rich is on fire.  He goes, and he's still going to call me up and ask, how was my appearance and stuff? 
[02:20:00]  He goes, but, and he told me, he goes, but watch, he will fuck something up.  And, oh my.  I didn't even expect it to be this big of a fuck.  His what, Dan?  Rich's Wikipedia has been updated.  Well, I don't do any of that shit.  Of course you don't.  The last entry says, on May 20th, 2009, Rich gave out his personal password, Comic 630,  on the Opie Anthony radio show, leading to immediate hacking of his Facebook, Twitter,  and email accounts.  Well, not my email.  They can't get to my email. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, they can't?  Well, Sam's got that.  No, he didn't get it quick enough.  That was the call.  I gave it back.  Oh, you gave it back.  He actually did the right thing.  Some of the guys are doing the right thing today.  Yes.  Which is kind of cool, to be honest with you.  See, this Twitter is really all I have.  No, the Kentucky guy, we're giving them a Jim Norton gizmo in a UFC video game.  Yeah, but who's putting all that gay shit on?  Hello.  I love this Twitter account.  But what I don't understand about Twitter, anybody could start a Twitter site and just 
[02:21:00]  take your picture and do it anyhow without it, you know what I mean?  Being the fake Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Well, that's what it is now.  Yeah, so anybody could do this anyhow.  It's not like any big fucking deal.  So, you know, there was, on my, there was-  Well, it's your name.  What's that?  It's your name, though.  So now if you want to start another one, you have to spell your name differently.  I'm like, holy shit, is that funny, Rich?  He's got it.  God bless you.  All right, let's go back to Kenny. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, fuck.  That's great.  We got the Club City Kenny country radio demo we're trying to get to.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Voss fucking rules, they're saying.  In his stupidity, Voss fucking rules.  Bravo, put in head.  That's Steven S. from Bayshore.  All right.  Rich Voss, look at your new Twitter picture.  Look at-  Oh, there.  Is it a horse's ass?  Yes.  That is a horse's ass.  An actual horse's ass. 
[02:22:00]  Holy shit, Rich.  Oh, my God.  This is quite a little-  It's just the greatest thing.  It's a horse's ass picture.  It says Rich Voss and then a plug for Jimmy's show.  Quite a po-fa.  And a bunch of gay followers.  A what?  Po-fa.  What's that word?  He didn't.  He didn't.  He didn't.  How great is it going to be when you hear that clip every time a caller bombs?  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, where's my fa?  Oh, my God.  What a fucking idiot.  I seem to have lost my fa.  I officially have a headache from laughing so hard.  Oh, fuck.  By the way, they're giving you advice, Rich.  Oh, fuck.  Mormon Jim is checking in.  He writes, Rich probably changed his password to Comic230.  Please tell me you didn't do that.  You're not that dumb.  No.  I made a po-fa. 
[02:23:00]  It's great.  Eat it with chopsticks.  Oh, my God.  A po-fa.  You would think after so many years, we just wouldn't be surprised or it wouldn't be funny anymore.  I think it's the depth of the well.  It's so amazing.  How could anyone not fucking love Voss? 
[02:23:30]  Listen.  Fantastic.  Voss is funny.  They're saying to go back to the Wikipedia page.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Please add that to the Wikipedia page, the po-fa thing.  Unbelievable.  Who does the Wikipedia for me?  Anyone.  Pretty much anyone.  Who does it?  Chewbacca.  Wikipedia.  Wikipedia.  Did he say Wikipedia?  It's a Wikipedia.  Rich Voss. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  What do we got on?  Anything?  Somebody's saying they're just crying over reading this thing.  Yeah, the whole thing has been edited.  What's some of the things they're saying?  With helpful information, I hope.  What's some of the things they're saying, Dan?  Oh, fuck.  You know that someone's, someone grabbed that.  That's their new name.  You know that's a new name.  Described by Jim Norton as a tall dwarf.  That was already on there. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, was it?  Yeah, that stuff was already on there.  I don't mind that shit.  You know what?  Listen, the bottom line is, I get on stage and I fucking kill.  Take Down Syndrome and make lemonade.  Dude, why don't say that stuff?  Don't worry about it.  You're actually right.  We'll just tease you.  Because it's the fact that you had to hesitate before you said it.  What, po-fa?  Yeah, that's right.  But it was the fact that you hesitated.  And it was like, you didn't just say, you're like, is it a po-fa?  You just kind of, po-fa?  It's just not, it's just amazing.  You stumbled out.  Oh, it is po-fa?  Yes, of course it is.  No, that's not the word. 
[02:25:00]  It is actually, but you stumbled it out.  It was funny to watch you trip on the word.  Instead of just saying a fuck up.  Wow.  Oh my God.  You just pronounced the po part a little weird.  Meaning master po, so.  Oh.  That's all.  Po-fa.  Wow.  Use po-fa in a sense.  I don't think you can.  Yeah, I can.  All right, go ahead, Rich.  My family was broke.  It was because of my po-fa. 
[02:25:30]  Couldn't get a job.  I'm going to have a fucking headache all day now.  Ah, the first official name has popped up as Comic 630.  Ah.  They're using it as just their names now.  Mm-hmm.  In various chat rooms.  Very nice.  And po-fa, I'm sure, is taken by now.  Po-fa has to be, yeah.  Absolutely.  Why isn't there a po-fa name? 
[02:26:00]  Po-fa.  Po-fa.  I know it doesn't sound right.  Po-fa or.  It's right.  Po-fa.  It's right.  It's just how you say it.  It's weird how you say it.  Po-fa.  Po-fa.  All right, whatever.  I'll ask Monica.  You just got to say it a little faster.  It's almost.  Can you do me a favor?  Can we call her now and you can ask her?  Please.  I don't know if she's up.  She'll be up.  It's 9.30 in the morning.  It's 9.15.  She's got a kid.  Of course she's up.  No.  You want to give out that number, too?  No.  Please call her so we can ask her on the air.  Please.  Ask her on the air.  Please.  Please.  Are she still meeting? 
[02:26:30]  Hold on.  I don't think she's up.  By the way, Rich is now 71 on his Wikipedia.  Wookie-pedia.  Wookie-pedia.  You lost two years.  They're shaving his age.  71 years old.  77.  77, my bad.  77.  You know what?  Steven has from Bayshore.  Voss' page on OA-pedia is a fucking hoot.  Are you awake?  It lists many of the words he's screwed up over the years.  So we could go there. 
[02:27:00]  I left you.  OA-pedia.com.  And then Scott S. from Quakertown writes, how does he make it through the day?  Can we please call Bonnie on the radio?  Don't.  Let's get her on the hotline.  Yeah, put her on the hotline.  How do you do that?  Give Travis her number.  It's not over the radio.  Kenny, we'll get to you after the break.  Kenny's just standing.  Just tell him on mic, you dummy.  There is such a list of words that Voss has fucked up.  There's a whole section.  It's called Vosscabulary.  Vosscabulary.  All right, can you roll through it?  In here.  Sure.  Roll through it. 
[02:27:30]  This is Vosscabulary.  He's tried to reference x-ray glasses and called them 3D glasses.  He's tried to call an obscure reference an absurd reference.  He's called Adam Ferrara, Adam Ferraro.  He said the city of Atlanta as Atlanta.  I'll just go through them now.  Almond Brothers.  Altertop.  Altertop instead of altertop.  Amazon.com. 
[02:28:00]  You know what?  You're doing every single one of them.  I'm sitting back in my chair.  Go ahead, Dan.  Angela Jolie.  Every one of them.  Archie Buncher.  Remember that band that did that song Sweet Dreams are made of these?  That was the arithmetic.  A river run throughs it. 
[02:28:30]  We're still on the A's.  All right, don't skip any.  Don't skip any.  This is amazing.  Scroll down.  How many we got?  Oh, my goodness.  That goes forever.  Just keep going.  The study of, I guess, stargazing is astrology.  Basking Robbins.  Benedict Arnold.  Benedict.  I remember that one. 
[02:29:00]  Benicio Del Toro.  Oh, excuse me.  I'm sorry.  I fucked that up.  Benicio Del Torrio.  Del Torrio.  Yeah.  The biggest shopping day of the year is Black Monday.  A wireless headset for your cell phone is Blue Teeth.  Blue Teeth.  I don't even know how to pronounce it.  I can't even say this the way they spelled it.  It's a snake.  Instead of a boa constrictor, it's a boa constrictor. 
[02:29:30]  Constrictor.  Boa constrictor.  Did you tell the light?  The American stickler.  Why should I tell them?  That's funny.  If you don't want people climbing over your fence, you get some bob wire.  I put it.  Boned it.  Bangladesh.  Yeah, Bangladesh.  Yeah, of course.  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  Whatever.  This is great.  The guy from Walking Tall was Buford Puffers.  I didn't say that. 
[02:30:00]  I didn't say that.  You did too.  Caligula was a character from a Bronx tale.  Louie Bean's Caligula.  Any other good ones?  That goes on and on, man.  Yeah, just keep doing the good ones, I guess.  Well, there was...  Clock.  Clock.  That's great.  Clock Worth Orange.  Is that cloak? 
[02:30:30]  Is that supposed to be cloak?  Yes.  That's cloak.  Is that a cloak?  He was wearing a cloak.  Apparently, at one time, Voss has referenced a DVD as a DDD.  How about one of my fans, when they went and it was Sherlock Holmes, he referred to the detective as Sherlock.  It's here.  It's on the list.  Star Trek.  Yeah, of course. 
[02:31:00]  Do you have Bonnie on the phone?  They're calling.  Okay, they're calling.  They're calling Bonnie.  Treadmill.  Treadmill.  Wesley Sipes.  Do you actually say wrote-in instead of written?  And everybody knows the horse Secretarius.  I have Wilkesboro, Pennsylvania.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:31:30]  And who can forget the great movement of this great United States?  It's the women's libs movement.  Bonnie.  Holy shit.  You need a hug so bad.  I just know.  In all my soul, you need a hug.  Quadricolegic.  Bonnie, you have no idea why we're calling, right?  Well, I know he did something dumb. 
[02:32:00]  Let's start with...  We're going over a list of...  No, no.  Do the other thing.  What did you say today again?  What?  The po-fa?  Yeah.  No, he did not.  Yeah, Rich wanted everyone to know that he made a po-fa today.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  But that's just...  But that's just...  Like, you guys, seriously, next summer I'm sending him to Sullivan.  Yeah.  Sullivan, he's got to just...  I went to Sullivan.  That's just the tip of the iceberg.  Po-fa?  Po-fa?  What is it?  Po-fa, right. 
[02:32:30]  Po-fa.  He just says it weird, right?  I can't believe that's real.  No.  I mean, at home he does stuff where I'm like, are you for real?  Poor Bonnie.  Not on the air right now.  Like, what does he do at home that you would say, like, are you for real?  Like, he'll say, like, how do you spell between?  Look, there's some words you're like, fuck.  There's two S's, but...  No, you know what I do now?  No, I just get Raina to tell him. 
[02:33:00]  Rich says you guys don't make out anymore, and that made me really sad.  That made me really sad.  Yeah, there should be some, you know, some romance and kissing and stuff.  I can't.  It's too much to go into.  All right.  I need to be laying down with a therapist.  Oh, Rich.  We're going to start kissing again.  And then he doesn't understand.  He said something like, you call him selfish.  And I'm like, all right. 
[02:33:30]  And then his example was like, yeah, like, you know, I go play golf all day while she stays home with the baby.  Yeah.  And then he doesn't understand why you might call him selfish.  Well, here, like, there's certain things that he just, okay, like, I'll have the baby and two bags and a stroller strapped on my back and a car seat and another hand.  And he'll be walking up ahead with his little fag bag, you know, not offering to help or carrying him.  He'll be like, Connor, hurry up.  What an ogre. 
[02:34:00]  She's a fucking farm girl.  You're strong.  It's not like you fucking haven't plowed before.  Is he not thoughtful?  He's completely insensitive, 100%.  Wow.  We're also looking at something called OAPedia.com, and it has a whole list of the words that Rich Voss has mispronounced over the years.  Oh, my God.  It's fantastic.  And it's so lengthy.  Is Pavarotti on the list?  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  When Rich asked if the Pavarotti were at my wedding.  Well, not only the Pavarotti, but also the Pavarazzi. 
[02:34:30]  The Pavarazzi.  Pofar.  What's the word instead of pofar?  Well, faux pas.  Well, faux pas is going up on that list.  So you mix up one.  It's faux pas.  Ah, fuck.  I just mixed up the F and the P.  That's all.  And I'll acknowledge, I butcher the language, but not to the extent of Mr. Rich Voss.  John Cousin.  I think you call John Cousin.  What's that?  No one expects you to be perfect, you know?  It'd be funny if you made a mistake now and again. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Not every time.  Now and again is good.  It's all right.  But there becomes a line where it's like, not only do people not expect you to be perfect.  Ron and Fliss.  How did you say that?  These are all real things you've said on our show.  I've never said that.  Yeah, you've said all these.  Yes.  You know, sometimes, you know, you...  I remember most of these.  Sometimes you're just, whatever, and you're talking fast.  Yeah, I know.  But who could forget the wonderful, delicious Sklone. 
[02:35:30]  Sklone.  Is Tortillias on there?  Oh, Tortillias.  Of course.  It has to be.  There it is.  Bonnie, someone actually wrote, how does Rich Voss make it through a day?  Because he's arrogant about it.  You called a tsunami a tsunami?  Tosami?  Yeah.  No, he'll say something.  He'll go, it's Tosami.  I'll correct you.  We'll correct you.  And he goes, no.  No, Lisa.  It's Tosami. 
[02:36:00]  How do we tell her the big news today?  Rich, you want to tell her?  No.  Well, Rich, we were talking about Twitter and how you Twitter and does Rich Twitter and  stuff like that.  And we wanted to see his site and give out his Twitter address so we could get more people.  Yeah, give him a little promotion, right?  Because we all give out our Twitter addresses and get a lot of people up there, and it's  good for updating gigs or whatever you want to do.  So he gave out his Twitter thing. 
[02:36:30]  He said, well, it's Comic230.  Comic630.  He gave his code.  Yes.  Yes.  Which was quickly picked up.  By everybody.  By everybody in the audience.  And we realized that it's his password for everything, by the way.  Oh, my God.  So he gave out on an international radio show his password to everything.  For Twitter, Facebook, and his email.  But listen to what she's saying.  She's like, oh, holy shit. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  And if you look.  She's going, oh, my.  Oh, my.  If you look at his Twitter, you'll see a picture of a horse's ass.  So asinine.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  It's a mistake.  I'm glad he's not doing Twitter anymore because, honestly, I can't keep up with how many things  he needs to spell.  Why?  Does he make spelling errors on Twitter?  No, he doesn't.  It's a spell check.  He'll also be like, how do you spell that?  Because it's endless. 
[02:37:30]  It's just this constant thing where I'm like, I refuse to spell for Twitter.  But, Bonnie, we printed out of pages of what they call vocabulary, which is the words he's  mispronounced.  It's five pages that we taped together.  It's as tall as they rock.  Can I just say something?  In Rich's defense.  Yeah.  Thank you.  He never went to school.  He was a drug addict.  He doesn't read at all.  Not even. 
[02:38:00]  Wait.  There's a couple of joys in here.  Instead of Rolls Royce, he called it a roast rice.  No, I didn't.  Instead of Roy Scheider, Roy Scheider.  Roy Scheider.  Oh, God.  Oh, there's a...  Did he actually say the mountain in Rushmore?  No.  I think you did.  Instead of Salvador Dali, Salvador Dali.  No, see, they're making it up.  He actually knows that one, and he brings it up all the time.  I know Salvador Dali.  Museum. 
[02:38:30]  You probably said it wrong once.  He knows that he'll try to, like, swing into conversation all the time.  That's one of them.  You stop me.  Holy mackerel.  It's astounding.  The famed chief of the cook, Wolfman Puck.  It's Wolfgang.  Wolfman Puck.  And we're going to cook some shrimp tonight.  It's the Wolfman. 
[02:39:00]  Wolfman Puck.  Oh, is that a good one?  Worcester, Massachusetts.  I remember that one.  Worcester.  That was a good one.  Let it be known, Bonnie.  He was having a great...  No joke.  A great appearance on our show.  Killing.  Didn't miss one joke, one line.  And I actually said on the air, I go, something's going to go wrong now.  Because he doesn't...  He feels uncomfortable when he's doing well.  So he'll blow it somehow.  And sure enough, he gives out his password.  Yeah.  Gave out his password. 
[02:39:30]  We're laughing so hard, we all have headaches now.  Do you get annoyed sometimes, Ollie?  If you have to watch the baby, it's an all-day job.  Do you kind of get annoyed if you see him grabbing his golf bag in the morning?  Um, no, it's that he's...  It's his entitlement that annoys me.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  I mean, he's constantly like, what?  I...  You know, I got to do this.  I do as much as you do.  I get to go golfing.  Why?  It's the only thing I get to do.  And it's just like this endless...  Well, because...  ...stuff out of his mouth.  The thing is, golfing's only a couple months out of the year. 
[02:40:00]  You manage to do it a lot in the winter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Honestly, Rich, the thing is, I don't mind you going golfing.  I really don't.  I think, like, God bless.  Go do it.  It's something you like.  Stress.  It relieves your stress, whatever.  But you actually...  Really?  Did you ever play golf, though?  It's like when, oh, I got to get up and eat a vlog in the morning.  God.  And when you get home from golfing, you're like, God, I'm so tired.  She's a fucking queen. 
[02:40:30]  You're tired of his constant whinging?  It's just like you go golfing and at least then you'll be like, I didn't even have a good game.  I should have gone.  It wasn't fun.  It's like, at least enjoy your time out of the house.  Well, I'm going to do a lot more.  And can we...  We'll start making out again, okay?  Well, I'll be the judge of that.  Oh, maybe she doesn't want to make out with you, Rich.  Why?  Well, you don't brush your teeth for women.  First of all, I do.  And I don't have to. 
[02:41:00]  They're fake.  You do.  You do.  I do.  You don't see...  You fucking brush your teeth too long.  No one spends that much time brushing her teeth.  Like for five fucking minutes.  It's almost insane.  That's about how long you're supposed to, right?  Officially?  It's supposed to be like two birthday songs, Rich.  Wait, he brushes his teeth too quickly?  I don't...  I've never seen him do it.  I do it all the time.  Didn't I have toothpaste in my bag yesterday when you asked for us to toothpaste?  Yeah, that's why you have it, and I don't, because I use it. 
[02:41:30]  Holy shit.  That's why I have golf clubs and you don't.  This is brutal.  You know what Rich said to me the other day?  I was eating.  He goes...  He was seriously angry.  He goes,  Do you have to chew with your mouth closed?  Do you think you are the Queen of England?  Chew with your mouth closed is a po-faw?  Yeah, she's trying to be all fucking snooty.  She's sitting in bed all snooty, eating, you know, like that, with her mouth closed. 
[02:42:00]  What's she supposed to do?  Enjoy your fucking food.  You're watching TV.  Who cares if your mouth's open?  Wow, that is a real silly thing to tell somebody.  What?  She's just sitting there eating with her mouth closed like a polite person.  And what do you want?  Just smack it around, have shit flying out of her mouth and make noises?  Yeah, join the party.  We...  But when we have sex, we have good sex.  Yeah.  Sometimes, right?  True or false, Bonnie? 
[02:42:30]  True.  Okay.  Oh.  No, that...  Oh.  Asking or telling.  Oh.  No, it's good.  Oh.  No, I mean, it's all right.  You know, what the fuck?  Bonnie, come on in.  I want to hug you.  Thank you.  I think she needs a hug.  Yeah, Bonnie needs a hug.  Because we can't even get Rich to hug anybody in studio.  And not in a gay way, just like a hug.  He doesn't like being touched.  He doesn't like being touched.  Oh, it's not that.  It's just...  Oh, boy.  See, he just...  I just touched his ankle.  He yanked his leg away. 
[02:43:00]  Just his wiener.  He almost pulled out his back.  Rich, it's affection.  Is he uncomfortable?  I learned how to take it.  Is he uncomfortable with affection?  Yes.  What?  Oh.  I...  Oh, she told you.  Wait, does she lay on you when you watch TV?  Are you kidding me?  I draw a line down the bed.  Yeah.  Pillows in between.  They don't even let Bonnie touch you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I massage her feet.  For like a few minutes, and then you go, now scram.  Now scram?  Yes.  I love these two. 
[02:43:30]  I want to just like watch you guys at home.  You should sell tickets.  Fuck the comedy club.  Set up bleachers in your house.  The interaction would be wonderful.  Why isn't this on TV?  For real.  You two rule.  I did do fucked up.  She told you this on the air before with my stylist.  With my...  Oh, no.  You did it again, Rich.  It's stylist from the phone. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my stylist.  No T at the end, I guess.  Stylist, right?  I don't even find out of that one.  One time, I think she was crying, and I grabbed her breast or something.  I don't fucking know.  Why?  You didn't know how to just comfort her?  Yeah, no.  He was comforting me, and then he reached in and grabbed my booze.  I was crying.  Wait.  Does he know how to comfort you when you're having a tough day?  No.  He gets really upset if I'm crying.  Why?  He gets really mad.  Because he thinks I'm faking. 
[02:44:30]  He thinks...  He's got like...  Oh, my God.  You can't be upset.  He's faking to get something.  Really?  Please never...  I think a lot of guys have it.  It's not just him.  Please never divorce our friend, Rich Voss.  Please.  Promise now.  I can't make that promise.  Like, you'll be crying about something, and what will he do?  Just start yelling at you?  Yeah.  He thinks I'm putting on tears.  Oh, my God.  Can't she actually be upset, Rich?  It depends at what. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  Who does Norton look like you said you were watching on TV?  Well, you guys have to go look at this documentary about...  Brad Pitt?  Yeah.  I saw a documentary about...  Brad Garrett.  ...these people who love, like, objects.  Object philia or something.  Oh, I saw that.  Object philia?  Object philia.  What's that?  So they fall in love with, like, the, like, buildings or this one chick that...  It's a clip on YouTube that I saw that someone sent it to me.  So this chick fell in love with, like, a ride at a carnival, a carnival ride. 
[02:45:30]  So she'd go and visit it and had pictures of it and whatever.  But the woman...  I'm sorry, Norton.  But the woman totally reminded me of Jim Norton.  Why?  Why?  Why does she have a cock in her mouth?  I don't know.  Well, she's very butch-looking, first of all.  Let me see her.  But there's something...  The way she talked.  It wasn't supposed to be how she looked, but the way she talked.  She's intelligent, you know.  Let's see.  I want to see her.  Intelligent.  Wow.  That must be a novelty for you. 
[02:46:00]  If I could say novelty.  I fell in love with her.  Oh, God.  I fell in love with her.  All right.  It's pretty fascinating.  Let's watch it.  We'll zip through it.  Did you guys find it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Danny's going to zip through it to try to find her.  That is fucking funny.  I am just, like, catching my breath.  No kidding.  Getting to the point where I can actually...  The last hour was just amazing on so many different levels.  Are you ever...  On a comedy level. 
[02:46:30]  I think I just saw her.  Bonnie, are you ever stunned at how many times he does this and how, like, it just isn't...  It doesn't get boring.  It doesn't, like, lose its amazement that he is actually like this.  Oh, that he's...  Are you talking about his lack of intelligence?  Yeah.  His what?  His lack of intelligence.  He's not smart about other things.  Like, who fucking...  Like, I built, you know, the shelves in the closet. 
[02:47:00]  Who remodel all that shit.  Did a lot of the kitchen stuff.  This is what he does.  He goes through all the things that he does, too.  That's how...  Like, you can't have a conversation with it.  But, like...  That doesn't matter.  Do you have that conversation a lot where Richard starts listing things he does that are good?  Yes.  Yes.  Do you get tired of it?  I don't.  The shelves.  No, but...  Why?  She does the same.  She'll go, I do this.  I do this.  Then I go, what I do?  She goes, it's not about you.  Well, you gotta fucking retaliate.  You gotta, you know...  No, but that's the thing that you don't have to retaliate.  No, you're from Canada.  That's how you guys stink. 
[02:47:30]  You guys don't retaliate.  No, no, no, no, no.  Listen, you've, like...  You've grown up...  Like, this is what makes you so good at radio is nothing rolls off your back.  You never just shrug and go, ah, well, so I said something wrong.  You always fight back.  That's what makes you good at radio.  But that's not what makes you good in a relationship.  Oh, shit.  Maybe we should wear headphones.  Listen, we gotta take...  Yes, yes.  We can continue with Bonnie after the break.  We'll figure that out.  But we really gotta step aside. 
[02:48:00]  Well, actually, I should...  I really...  I'm gonna come down there.  I'm so...  Oh, good.  Oh.  But can't she come in...  I don't...  Yeah, just put her on the list.  Put her on the list.  She needs a hug.  If you leave now, we can get you on before the end of the show.  Bring the baby in so they can see the baby.  Bring the baby.  What, she had to leave the baby by itself in the hotel room with the gas?  Bring the baby.  Yeah, we gotta talk about the gas thing when Bonnie gets here.  Bonnie, thank you.  We really gotta move on for now.  We'll see you in a few minutes.  Yeah, no problem.  Okay, see you guys later.  Hurry up in a cab.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm Rich Boss, and we're back with the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:48:30]  If you listen to this one, this is one of my finest moments in show business.  And probably one of his finest moments in show business.  I bet you when he was...  Well, you gotta hear what it is, but I bet you when he was done with this, he got on  the phone and called some friends and goes, guess who I did a scene with, okay?  Because I'm known, just because he's an Oscar winner, doesn't mean people don't know me.  Like, I know him for what he does, but so many celebrities come up to me and go, oh, you're 
[02:49:00]  funny.  Hold on.  God, I choked on my own lies.  Guys, this was one of the coolest things I ever did on the O&A show.  Anyhow, look, take a listen.  I'm getting the fuck out of here.  Thank you guys for listening today.  It was a lot of fun coming in.  It brought back some fucking great memories, some fun memories.  Let it be known that many times I carry the show, and stay tuned. 
[02:49:30]  Go to my website, richboss.com.  Come out to the shows.  If I told you to go fuck yourself, I meant it.  If I told you I liked you, I meant it.  Whatever.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony's.  Okay, Rich, you want to come up?  Let's go to the thing.  We're going to do Voss's scene.  They're going to do a little scene.  We're going to do a scene from A Bronx Tale.  Watch and enjoy.  Turn the mic towards that one.  Turn the mics together.  Yeah, I think so.  We would do it in an audition.  Let me just prep this a little bit.  All right, so basically, Rich Voss talks about how he sucks at auditions. 
[02:50:00]  Right, Rich?  Yes, hold on.  Okay, here we go.  And a lot of times you guys got to do cold reads, right?  Yes.  Way to go, Steve.  That was the big thing.  So Voss is going to do a cold read.  He's going to do...  Look at this dumb face!  Oh, my God!  Look at Voss's retarded, stupid face!  We just set up Voss.  He wants to call his mother!  We just set up Voss so bad.  Steve, the worst timing in radio, by the way.  Not at all.  He told me to. 
[02:50:30]  No, we needed the big setup, but Jimmy was going to do the scene with Rich Voss, a cold  scene, but actually, Jimmy was never going to do a scene with Rich Voss.  No.  Chaz Palmitari is going to be the scene.  Chaz Palmitari.  Look at Voss's hands!  He can't move his hands!  They're wiggling!  His little fingers can't stop moving!  And it's Chaz Palmitari, who, by the way, wrote this Bronx Tale, which he's performing  alone, a one-man show on Broadway. 
[02:51:00]  Which we saw and we loved.  Amazing.  We had a man talking about it, yeah.  He's trying his best to figure out something funny to say to get him out of this weird pain  easy.  Did you watch Last Comic Standing?  That ain't going to help you.  Hey, Chaz, how are you, buddy?  How are you doing?  Good.  Good to see you again.  Chaz actually extended his run at the Winford Theater yet?  At the Waltercourt Theater on 48th.  Until February 24th, so a little over a week.  You got, what, 11 days.  11 more days, and then it's done. 
[02:51:30]  And I'm telling you, Jimmy and I saw it with our girls, and we absolutely loved it.  It's a one-man play.  This one-man show is amazing.  It's absolutely amazing.  Is this the play, or this is the movie?  This is from the film, but when Chaz does the play, does the whole thing by himself.  It's an amazing work of art.  It's how he originally did it.  He knows the lines.  Dude, he's the only guy on stage.  This is how the movie was made back in the day, and now he's going backwards to redo the  one-man show.  By the way, one of the best stories I've ever heard in terms of... 
[02:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Very inspirational story, dude.  Your whole story is great.  Oh, thanks very much.  He stuck to his guns and said, I'm going to do this myself.  It was beautiful.  It was a beautiful...  Voss is a twitching mess.  His hands, his little fingers.  Look at him.  It's like playing the piano.  You all right?  Sir, what did that sweaty little hand feel like?  Did it feel like you would have an oyster bar?  His dead little slug hands.  All nervous.  He's sweating.  Oh, we set up Rich really bad, man.  Really bad. 
[02:52:30]  He thought he was doing a scene with Norton.  He's fixing his tie that he doesn't even have on.  Chaz, by the way, that's Danielle.  She's in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.  Hi, Danielle.  Hi, how are you?  She has way too many clothes on.  She's pretty much...  You ever see Bronx Tale Beautiful?  Huh?  You ever see Bronx Tale?  On the plane?  No, no, no.  On the plane.  It's one of the great, great American movies of all time.  Yeah, I can imagine.  Children of God.  No, City of God.  Yeah, of course.  It's bigger than that.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  So Voss is going to play, of course, C, and Chaz. 
[02:53:00]  Now, when you wrote this, I noticed in the script it's Johnny, but originally Johnny is  now Sonny, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  But Voss is going to play C.  We only have a short scene.  And any direction you might want to give Rich as far as how he should be delivering these  lines...  Yeah.  From my car.  ...will go...  This is so epic.  ...in one ear and out the other.  This is so epic.  By the way, these guys didn't know either.  This is so...  Do you understand?  No one knew.  He was going to have a hard time with No-Neck Jim. 
[02:53:30]  Never mind Chaz.  This is unbelievable.  Chaz Voluntary.  This is the guy that wrote it.  I didn't even know that was him for a second.  Like, he looks like a rocker from back in the day.  I thought it was some rocker.  Lou Reed or somebody.  I'm like, what?  Right.  Okay.  He's a stand-up comic.  Come on.  I mean...  But he's also...  He fancies himself quite an actor.  Oh, I do really?  That's why we put...  You were praying about me.  Oh, come on.  You were just...  I played Eddie Bruce.  Play the clip.  No.  We're going to watch this clip.  I had time to prepare.  But you know what?  It's no problem.  All right.  Look at this fake bravado. 
[02:54:00]  I know.  I'm a mess.  I really...  He really is trying to get confidence attacking his friends.  Just focus on Chaz's eyes.  You're a stand-up comic.  You don't have to tell you to relax.  Come on.  No.  And he's got sunglasses on.  I can't do what you guys do, man.  So, come on.  You don't need to.  We're desperate.  Yeah.  You don't need to.  You can act.  You don't have to.  You can't look at him.  All you have to do is buy a sandwich.  You're bombing.  In front of Chaz.  What's wrong with you?  Just relax.  I'm very relaxed.  Breathe in.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  Now, hold it.  It's pretty fun.  What are you kidding me?  I haven't done this.  Don't let it out.  I can't believe I'm doing this here for you guys.  But I guess...  We greatly appreciate it.  Well, Chaz, the pressure...  You have no idea.  They'll be talking about this one for a while.  The pressure is not on you.  The Rich Vines set up.  You can just pretty much read it.  We want to see what Rich can do with it.  Yeah.  You've proven pretty much...  All right.  Come on, Rich.  Let's see what you got there.  Let's go.  Don't screw up my words.  Go ahead.  Hey, wait.  Set up the scene, please.  We need an action, too. 
[02:55:00]  Who wants to set up the scene?  Yeah.  I'll set it up.  Okay.  This is when Collegio and Sonny get together, and Collegio is telling Sonny, you know,  this guy, Louie Beans, owes him a lot of money, and he's not paying him.  And what am I going to do about it?  So, finally, Sonny tells him, you know, he's kind of like...  He's a philosopher, Sonny.  And he says, look, don't worry about the money.  I'll straighten it out for you.  Listen, this is the reason why you shouldn't worry about it.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's go.  Louie, Beans, I want my money.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever. 
[02:55:30]  See, come on.  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans, this guy owes me 20, and it's been two weeks now, and every time I see him,  he dies at me.  What the...  I know.  Hold on.  It's better than I thought it would be.  What are you doing?  Because you're not breathing.  No, just take a breath.  You're saying a whole paragraph on one breath.  Chaz is laughing right at you.  Chaz is doubled over, and he's laughing at you. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, this is better than I am.  He's like, wow, this reminds me of Kaiser Solstice.  No, I'm laughing because of what he says.  You're not breathing.  You're not breathing.  He went and then started his lines.  It wasn't going to stop until he was done with the scene.  You have to take a breath.  All right.  You can pause.  Hey.  Pause.  This is a cold read.  I didn't see it.  It's really cold.  It's freezing.  Start over, Ratchet.  Go ahead.  All right.  I got it.  Start over from...  John, I got a problem.  No, I'm going to start from the beginning.  All right. 
[02:56:30]  Just this time, try acting.  Yeah.  What's that?  Nothing.  Try looking up at him a little.  Well, you know, he's not connecting...  Hold on.  He's not connecting with me.  Are you crazy?  Oh, my God.  Are you not?  I don't want to say that.  Chaz, he stinks.  Get your act together, promisory.  What's wrong with you?  Chaz, you need the proper motivation.  Listen, Mr. One Man Play.  This is Rich Voss here.  Chaz, your motivation can be this.  Let's throw up while he's acting. 
[02:57:00]  Chaz can do this in his sleep, Rich.  Listen, just try to look up from the page and connect with him.  All right.  Should I...  Come on, you want to connect?  Come on, Rich.  Let's go.  I hope he locks the door and says, now you can't leave.  All right.  Let's show.  Go ahead.  Let's do it.  All right.  Come on.  Louie, Beans, I want my money.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on.  What are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie, Beans, this guy owes me 20, and it's been two weeks now, and every time he sees 
[02:57:30]  me, he keeps dodging me.  Should I crack him one or what?  Come on.  Listen.  He wants his Girl Scout cookies.  Sometimes violence is not the answer, kid.  Is he a good friend of yours?  No, John.  I don't even like this guy.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Hey, look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him, right?  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again, right?  He's out of your life for $20, so forget about it.  Look.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny? 
[02:58:00]  Look.  Look?  Isn't even in the thing.  Look.  Jesus.  Why don't you look at the line, stupid?  Hey, C.  Watch this thing.  I don't want to...  You just got fired from me, C.  Hey, listen, kid.  Get back on your father's bus and get out of my face.  I got to tell you one thing also.  Chaz is delivering these lines, like, perfectly.  Yeah.  I understand you've done this.  You wrote this. 
[02:58:30]  But that's watching the consummate actor and a buffoon.  Listen, hold on, shock doc.  Let me tell you something.  Okay, first of all, I don't want to disrespect Mr....  Listen.  Try acting better.  Let's talk about his name right.  Mr. Watt, you can't even pronounce his name right.  Chaz is funny.  Chaz.  What?  What?  The thing is...  He's just spiraling out of control.  He didn't...  Why are you reading the paper to explain how bad you are? 
[02:59:00]  Because the last line you got off cheap, he didn't deliver, so I didn't have my cue.  You know what it's called?  Oh, you're blaming him.  Yeah, because...  No, I know, because he knows what...  He wrote it, so he knows it.  He's alive in the moment, Rich.  He's alive in the moment.  And don't you wink at Chaz Palminteri like...  Did you...  Did you...  What'd he do?  He winked.  He winked at him to say, I'm just joking.  He just winked at him.  I saw you.  Why are you winking at Chaz?  First of all, the first two lines I knocked out.  Can I ask you a question?  The first...  You should be knocked out.  On the last line... 
[02:59:30]  He knocked him out, all right.  On the last...  Did I write this stuff or what?  He knocked him out, all right?  Well, you don't think the first two lines I grabbed out...  I'm having a little problem with this paragraph.  His hands are going.  He's like...  Here's the thing.  Which paragraph?  This one right here.  I got a problem with this guy over here.  Because I don't know...  Just this silly line.  That's very famous in a famous movie.  Because this is my type of character.  Where should we pick this up?  Oh, is it?  Where should we pick this up?  I see. 
[03:00:00]  No, I can...  You know what?  Do your line again, Rich.  You're doing the beginning, Rich, because you're putting the inflection in the wrong place.  What's that?  You're putting the inflection in the wrong place, Rich.  I want my money.  Have you seen the movie?  I've seen it many a times.  He's yelling at some kid across the street.  He wants his money.  Yeah, that's why I yell, Louie Beans.  You're hyped up.  You want your money.  I don't...  And he's calming you down.  Listen to me.  You can't deliver to every paragraph as it's the same emotion.  Yes.  At the end, you're going, you're right, John. 
[03:00:30]  You're always right.  How do you know?  Right answer all the time, Johnny.  You talk like Hal from 2001, A Space Odyssey.  Yeah, listen to what Chaz is saying and react to that.  He just said a very profound thing to you in life.  Right.  You got this guy out of your life for $20.  Who cares?  Good for you.  You made out.  So what I'm saying is listen.  And then you're like, listen to what he's saying.  Take a moment to think like...  Now it's a revelation.  You've actually...  Yes.  You realize this.  It's a big moment.  Yeah.  Chaz is agreeing with everybody. 
[03:01:00]  You're going to go like this.  Except Rich.  Except for Rich.  Chaz isn't shouting at you.  He's just chatting.  He's not yelling, kid!  You don't get out.  It's like...  You're not...  You're right, John.  You're always right, sucker!  Listen to me.  When Bonnie gives you a pep talk after you bomb, right?  You never see...  Right there.  You go, you're right.  I don't know what you're saying.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  That's what the emotion you want.  All right.  Let's start again.  Let's try it again.  Because Watch has a hunk here, and I think that he'll do better this time.  We're running out of show, unfortunately.  Go ahead.  Let's go.  All right.  Here we go.  Louie, Beans, I want my money. 
[03:01:30]  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  See, what are you doing?  Come on.  What are you yelling about?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie, Beans, this guy owes me $20, and it's been two weeks now, and every time he sees  me, he keeps dodging me, John.  Should I crack him one or what?  Listen, see, come on.  Sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John.  I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again. 
[03:02:00]  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on.  You got to have cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time, and I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  What do you read?  You know, I read things.  You know, I read philosophy.  Philosophy?  You read philosophy?  Come on, John.  Sure.  You ever hear of Machiavelli?  Who?  Come on.  Nick Machiavelli.  What? 
[03:02:30]  I only wish Boss had to say that word.  Wait.  Who?  Who's Mark Veli?  That would be more like a real-life thing with him.  Like, hey, man, don't argue with the guy for $20.  Who?  Who?  What?  That's all Boss should ever say his words.  He's doing a good job.  You don't think that was better?  No, that was better.  Oh.  It's better.  It's better.  It was better.  It was better.  Okay.  I guarantee we do it one more time, I knock it.  No, no, no.  It's over.  So, so, so. 
[03:03:00]  Next, next, next, next, next.  Shaz threw in the towel on his own work.  That's wonderful, Rich.  You were better, except when you didn't know the guy.  I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louis Beans?  I didn't say that.  You got up.  Yes, you did.  You scared Shaz on who?  He actually jumped.  Who?  Who?  Who?  There's no animals in this picture.  There's an owl.  You're the worst actor I've ever seen.  Yeah, but I'm a stand-up comic.  So am I, but I can act. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, but you know what?  I'm a brilliant stand-up comic.  No, let's not get carried away.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Exactly.  Hey, Rich.  How many of them to gain them?  How nervous were you, Rich, when you saw Shaz come through that door?  A little nervous.  I was nervous.  A little nervous.  Yeah, we didn't tell you guys either.  I saw him standing there.  We wanted this to be a big surprise.  Okay, here's the thing.  And we appreciate Shaz playing along, by the way.  We weren't even sure he was going to do this for us.  Shaz didn't know.  Well, I just went and asked him in the green room if he would do it.  He was like, yeah.  That's pretty cool, man.  We wanted the committee to plug a Bronx town. 
[03:04:00]  I'm like, what better way than to see it done half right and half horrendously?  So if you want to see it done all right, you're going to go check it out.  I'm not even just raving because you're here, man.  It really was a moving, unbelievably great piece of work.  I appreciate that, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Now, Rich, go audition for a revival of Newsies.  Extra, extra.  We're running out of show, unfortunately.  I have a pilot coming.  Thanks a lot, fellas.  Thank you, Tash.  That was amazing.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss. 
[03:04:30]  You know, this is the only time my daughter called into the show here.  She called in.  I didn't even tell her to call in.  Did I?  Well, she texted me.  And then she called in.  I guess they were talking to her.  I mean, if you listen, you know, and we talk about, I don't want my kids listening to this garbage.  I guess.  What?  Why are we still doing it?  Holy shit, man.  Well, because when Rich Voss is in studio, he tries to give a show. 
[03:05:00]  I don't, I get to do this maybe once a year, you know, fill in.  And listen, I know you guys came here on your day off.  What's, what's he writing about me behind my back?  It says he stinks.  All right.  What was I at?  Yeah, fake teeth and your daughter calling in.  You know, and then my daughter called in, which I'm surprised that she called in and she was listening because I'm surprised she was up that early.  You know, when you're out dancing at night, you know, trying to pay for college, you don't get up as early. 
[03:05:30]  And she called in and then it brought back memories of at the virus tour and when Anthony was drunk and he was being rude to my daughter.  They're semi rude.  Some of it was being trying to him, trying to be funny.  Me, whatever.  I mean, if I had more going on in my career, I would have belted him in the head.  But when this is the last thing you're hanging on to until something else happens and then you can tell these guys to go fuck off. 
[03:06:00]  I let us fly.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We got a compliment for Rich Voss.  Hey, Opie, I finally saw Voss's stand-up.  It is mind-boggling how funny he is on stage and how amazingly awful he is on the radio.  You know, I am totally not awful.  They just can't give me a compliment.  I know.  First of all, I can't do it.  Thank you for coming to see me.  You know what? 
[03:06:30]  I love you on the radio show.  Yeah, geez.  What do you got to do here?  I'm just throwing a shot over my mouth.  I can't believe how good Bobby looks.  Huh?  Bobby looks like his old headshot, only if he was older in his old headshot.  You know what I mean?  That's how good you look.  I don't like the scarf, but aside from that, what's up with the scarf?  I have a coat, dude.  Dr. Moreau.  Guys don't really wear scarves, though.  You look like that lady that gets a lot of the...  You just deal with the coat.  I'm looking around.  You do have kind of a chick look to you.  Yeah, he does.  Do I?  Yeah, if you put like a wig on, I think you could have like a lady-like features. 
[03:07:00]  What are you saying, Anthony?  I'm saying I'm kind of digging you.  I'm kind of digging those black camos.  I've completely lost my mind.  I'm coming to work now dressed in camo.  I see that, yeah.  This is ridiculous.  It's not even camo for woods.  It's for like cement.  This is...  You're in a cement field.  They're very comfortable pants, by the way.  Yeah, but they're black camo.  What are they for?  What's black camo?  Isn't that defeat the purpose?  I don't care.  Defeat the purpose of what? 
[03:07:30]  I'm not wearing...  Camo?  I'm not wearing them for the camo.  Who wears camo for the camo?  What am I, hiding from them?  I don't know.  Who wears camo for the camo?  Army?  Marines?  Yeah, the boys over there.  But I mean, if you're walking around New York and you're wearing camos, you're just wearing  it to wear them.  You mean the average Joe.  The average Joe, yes.  I know the boys are...  The average Joe with every weapon.  Yeah, he's not the average Joe.  At his house, in the closet.  My urban combat gear.  Just let...  Can you do me a favor and just let me know?  When you know, just call me.  Send me a text.  Bobby. 
[03:08:00]  I know all the proper channels.  Just let me know.  I was privy to his gun closet recently.  What?  Oh, my God.  Do you look like a video game?  Oh, my God.  I've decided to just...  You've got to start locking that closet, man.  No, I've decided to just put a vault door on that closet door now, instead of locking  the guns up in a vault in the closet.  Yeah, you have to.  It will now just be a vault door, which will be like a panic room also.  It's a huge walk-in closet, Bobby.  A huge walk-in closet that is well-stocked. 
[03:08:30]  Yep.  Well-stocked.  Oh, come on, Voss.  Nice one, Voss.  Was that Voss?  Yeah.  He had one in the chamber that went off.  And Voss showing us all his teeth without his fake teeth.  All right.  Where are you going?  There's a bathroom right there.  What happened?  Voss, what's going on with your teeth?  You popped out your fake teeth to show your little...  What are they called?  Like little nubs.  Little nubs.  Little daggers.  Little golem nubs.  Yeah.  It's just a process that, you know, I'm going through with Dr. Gottesman and Holden where, 
[03:09:00]  you know, they file the teeth down.  And then the temporary bridge keeps slipping out.  So I got to go get it re-cemented.  What's wrong with your teeth?  Ever since I've known you, you've been getting them dumb choppers worked on.  What started the teeth problem?  The drugs?  No, I think it was lack of flossing and brushing.  Oh, really?  As a kid?  No, it all started when I was 45.  So they were great up till then. 
[03:09:30]  And, you know, I have bad gum disease in my family, you know, so my mom has no teeth.  But without the teeth on there, that really looks bizarre.  It's all filed down.  Yeah, they look almost like fangs.  Yeah, your mouth should be boiling in a pot in Quint's house.  Give yourself a crash.  No, that's a good one, actually.  I knew it was going to work. 
[03:10:00]  I sent the picture out to the Twitter universe so they could see the awfulness.  Why is your daughter calling us?  My daughter's calling?  And why does she have the hotline?  Because she's hot.  Well, which daughter?  One of the most uncomfortable moments ever, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  One of the virus shows and Anthony openly trying to pick up Voss' daughter.  Oh.  But make him believe it wasn't real.  I was just talking to her.  Oh, Voss was in a quandary.  He didn't know what to do.  And I can't believe you right then didn't realize or the next day go, I need to go to meetings right after that. 
[03:10:30]  Right after you were completely drunk and out of your mind, hitting on a 17-year-old going, you know what, maybe this is my bottom.  If he knew she was that old, he would never want to talk to her.  Yeah, I thought your daughter was my bottom.  Ant's one of those guys.  Ant's one of those guys.  He'll never go to a meeting.  He's just one of those guys.  What the freak am I going to a meeting for?  I got things to do.  Oh, why are you getting upset?  Oh, you know what, see?  Yeah, what's wrong?  There's one meeting he'd go to.  Did we hit a nerve there or something?  What's going on?  Oh, yeah.  That meeting. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I go to meetings.  They're just different.  They're very secret.  We're a little uniform.  They'd love you, too.  Hello, greasy northern Italian.  Welcome.  I know.  I don't think I'd be welcome.  You'd be spit on and hung.  Of course I would be.  Hey, Voss' daughter, Jess, is on the line.  Jess.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, what are you doing?  Why are you calling?  I don't know.  I was bored.  I just thought I'd call and say hi.  Why are you listening to this radio station?  Oh, shit, a cop.  What's that?  She goes, oh, and then dropped the S-bomb instead of cop. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  She can't be on the phone.  Are you driving?  I hope she said cop.  Oh, gracious.  Oh, my God.  How old is Jess?  18.  18 now.  Okay.  Yeah, now I am.  She's driving and calling and texting.  Are you going to school today?  Yeah, right now.  All right.  Yeah.  How are your teeth, Jess?  You take care of them?  I was just going to say, my teeth are perfect.  Don't put the family in the middle of this. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, you pretty much said it was some family epidemic of nasty choppers.  Yeah.  My teeth are straight, white.  They're perfect.  Yeah, that's because I got you braces as a kid.  Yeah, but I didn't pull them off like you did with pliers, you know?  You didn't have to sell them for crack either.  You pulled your braces off with pliers?  Yeah.  When I got my braces, like the wire that goes across was digging into my gums and I ripped  them out.  So how about you go to the orthodontist and say there's a problem with my braces instead 
[03:12:30]  of ripping them out like an old carburetor?  You know, I was a kid.  You know, I made some wrong decisions.  Some wrong decisions.  You were desperate for money.  Yeah.  What's that?  You were desperate for money.  Boy, she knows your whole story, huh?  Did daddy ever tell you the story with the, uh...  What?  I can't.  First of all...  The girl with the cat box?  I don't want to know.  I don't want to know.  How about this?  You ever seen pictures on your daddy's phone?  Look, look, I know Voss is in a panic and I understand. 
[03:13:00]  I'm going to do it this way.  Uh, Jess, what is the most horrific story, uh, your dad told you about his life?  That someone else might have told you.  I'd like to...  The worst story that your father told you about his life.  Because he's told a few doozies on our show over the years.  A couple of rules.  I don't think anything.  Yeah, and...  Mm-hmm.  Nothing too bad, really.  Yeah, but you know that I had a tougher life and that I am a complete turnaround and a good  dad, right?  Yes, exactly.  Perfect. 
[03:13:30]  Perfect, right?  Perfect.  Like, if, like, if you, if, if you had a pick between me and Norton as a dad...  Mm, Norton, what a, what a hottie.  Oh, girl.  Oh, wow.  Wow, look at that.  My daughter has...  Blinky!  Hey, Blinky!  Blinky!  Oh, she's totally facing you.  No, it's affectionate.  Both of the Voss daughters have had crushes.  They've had crushes on me for many years.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know the Voss daughters very well.  They've both been kind of in love with me since they were 10, 11 years old.  Ew, I'm not in love with you.  That's all right.  Don't be, don't be ill. 
[03:14:00]  You got an ew.  You got an ew, and she called you Blinky.  That's cute.  The Voss daughters love me.  That's fantastic.  Why don't you hang up, because you really only...  Look how nervous Voss is getting.  It only takes one Voss to bring this show to a dead hole.  I don't need that.  You stay on the phone as long as you want.  Yeah, you're nervous, because you don't know where this is going to go.  I know how...  Hey, Jess, did your mom ever badmouth your dad?  I don't want to say that in front of him.  He would get really upset, you know.  No, I mean, like, years ago, you were calling a worthless piece of crap or anything. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, what's the worst thing mommy said about your dad?  I don't remember.  When they, like, lived here, I was, like, three years old.  Yeah.  Well, listen, one of you, Opie or Andy, I don't remember who was who, you promised me you would  take me out to New York City and spend so much money on me.  That day had not come.  It was Anthony.  Well, you know something?  You were underage at the time, and I didn't think it was appropriate.  And you were under the influence?  No, no.  Yeah.  Oh, like, like...  She should be okay for you, Rich.  Jess, like, you haven't had a drink or two. 
[03:15:00]  Never.  Oh, yeah.  I caught her out while I drank with her friends.  And then when we went in, I went in to yell at her and discuss it with my ex-wife.  My ex-wife tells Bonnie to come in.  So Bonnie's sitting there uncomfortably, you know, as we're smashing her.  And Jess, this is Jess's defense.  All my friends drink.  Yeah.  It's true.  It's true.  See?  It's a good defense.  It used to be 18.  So what?  They changed the law.  Yeah, wasn't it all?  Stupid.  Stupid law.  She's doing all right. 
[03:15:30]  Some college campuses try to get it back down 18, by the way.  I'll tell you what, Jess.  I think me and you should go to one of your father's shows.  We'll sit right up front and just make out in front of him.  No, that's disgusting.  She means watching the show.  I just think it would make him a little uncomfortable.  It might be funny.  It might make everybody uncomfortable.  Yeah, it might.  I'm going to go.  You guys are really boring me.  Oh, Christ. 
[03:16:00]  Hang up.  Wow.  It was nice talking to you.  Goodbye, Father.  See you later.  Peace out.  Bye.  Oh, hey, guess what?  Good.  Wow.  What's the guess what?  I'm going to tell her 50 Cent News going to be curious.  She's listening to the radio.  She knows.  No offense.  She's kind of a C.  Jesus Christ.  Did she get that from your ex-wife?  No.  Jesus Christ.  She's anything like the ex-wife.  I know why she's an ex-wife.  She got it from my younger daughter.  Wow.  She just beat up everybody.  Yeah.  I'm bored.  She just took us all out. 
[03:16:30]  I'm bored with you guys.  The boss daughters have been crazy about me since I met them.  Oh, sure they have.  They can't help it.  Yeah.  Hey, Blinky.  Hey, Blinky.  She's just dissing you.  Yeah, but she doesn't know how to say it.  Like, God, Jim, how you been?  I miss you.  No, of course.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony brought to you by Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Bastards  starring Brad Pitt in theaters August 21st.  Now here is Sirius 197 XM 202.  Virus. 
[03:17:00]  Behold.  It's the Worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss.  I'm Rich Voss and we're back with the Worst of Opie and Anthony.  I hope you guys took care of everything you had during your little break there because  we got some funny shit coming up.  Here's some sex stories.  I guess Bonnie and I, we talked about some of our sex stories before, you know, before  and after we met.  And, you know, when you're with your girlfriend at the time, she was, I think my girlfriend  or maybe my wife.  It was probably my wife. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  That was during the virus tour or around then.  You know, we're telling stories.  Whenever you tell sex stories about before you met, you never tell the real truth.  You know, it's always, it's always, you try to, you know, dumb it down.  Not dumb it down.  That's me just talking.  It was dumbing it down.  You try to like, you know, sweeten it.  You know, uh, you know, if I told her real stories, she wouldn't be with me or I probably 
[03:18:00]  wouldn't be with her.  You know, uh, you know, just, uh, some of the comics I know she's been with, I'm disgusted  thinking about it.  And I guess some of the comics I've been with, she's disgusted thinking about it.  You know, it's fucking, we're both in the business.  Uh, so I remember when, uh, this is talking about when I was banging her, why, uh, Jimmy was  on stage at the, uh, PNC bank in the base, in the basement there.  I don't know what got me horny.  I'm sure it wasn't a stupid fucking Norton's act. 
[03:18:30]  Uh, I don't know what it was.  It's just, I guess having sex where you're not supposed to.  Uh, I remember one time we were at Rascal's at a comic book when that was open.  I fucked her in the dressing room there and, uh, we were glad, you know, I'm glad she didn't  get pregnant from either one of those places because I wouldn't want my baby.  I wouldn't want to know, I wouldn't want to know that my baby was conceived in the basement  of PNC art center while he fucking Norton's on stage.  That would be kind of like creepy.  Uh, so we had some good sexual weird, uh, the other night we had some major sex, old 
[03:19:00]  school shit.  You know what I'm saying?  The old school shit.  When you first met each other, I remember what I was fucking when she was on her period.  That's how much I liked her then.  You know what I'm saying?  You ever do that with a girl?  No.  Yeah.  I mean, I remember putting a towel on the bed in the hotel.  It's back to hotels.  They're disgusting.  Fucking period juice all over the place.  You know, you go look at a hotel with a black light, you know, or, or my balls with a black  light. 
[03:19:30]  You're going to see shit.  You know what I'm saying?  So here's some sex stories.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I fucked Jessica Simpson in her ass.  Well, language Anthony.  That's what I wanted to hear.  I fingered her.  Wouldn't it have worked?  No.  No.  No.  Not a story.  You can only say that if a girl died.  Let my friends smell it.  What?  If a girl died, you could say that.  Like, I fingered her after.  Then people want to hear it.  Oh, my God.  It suddenly is insensitive. 
[03:20:00]  Don't you guys have a famous fingering story?  Um, wait a minute.  You and Voss?  Uh-oh.  We got his fingers.  What could be possibly famous?  They were mistaken for gargoyle hands?  You told it on stage one time.  I did some girl's belly button.  And the whole time, Rich was like, it's not true.  It's not true.  Which story wasn't true?  I don't know.  Maybe it's the one where...  I don't know.  I don't want to get into our stories.  Well, but Bonnie knows the story.  So what story are you referring to, Bonnie?  I don't remember, but you fingered a girl on the street.  Oh, yeah, up on Broadway. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, right.  Oh, no, no, not that time.  Yeah, yeah.  No kidding.  Jimmy was getting ahead.  No, no, no.  Do you want the story?  I mean, we said it.  I know it's not true.  I thought I knew it.  It's a radio story.  He can't figure anybody with those hands.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, we'll play along.  He can't figure anybody with those hands.  Me and Jimmy were coming out of something.  But you weren't, because this is just for the radio.  Well, this is a radio story.  We've told it before, but I'll tell it real quick.  It's not real.  We were coming out of a building, and some girl comes up to us.  What building?  But is it true?  Because you could say it's true. 
[03:21:00]  It was a 12-step meeting or something.  I don't know.  We were coming out of it.  Let's say it was the Daily Planet building.  Because it's not a real story.  Right.  It's not real.  We use a fake building.  It was Jimmy Olsen, and I was Lois Lane.  Let's say it wasn't on Houston.  Let's say it wasn't.  It wasn't anywhere even near it.  Let's say we weren't coming out of a meeting.  And then SOB's was right there.  And they just used it in Houston because it's local.  It's a funny word.  Yeah, right on.  And let's say like a 9 1⁄2 to an 11, Blackjack walks up to us and recognizes me. 
[03:21:30]  And we're going to have bagels.  And we take her.  And say, do you want to go have a bagel with us?  And we go have a bagel.  Then we say, hey, we're going to go look at, go up to the peep booth like it's a normal  thing after bagels.  Would you like to come?  Right.  And she comes.  And then say you go into the peep booth, and she goes into the stall with me.  And the guy who's, the Indian guy who's homeless now kicks us out.  Right?  Why?  You can't have a guy and a girl in there?  No.  Not that's what I heard.  You can't have a guy and a girl.  But he heard.  It's always a little guy.  And then say you're standing on Broadway right across in the Letterman Theater. 
[03:22:00]  But none of this happened.  None of this.  Never.  And you're fooling around with a girl.  Where there isn't a place called show world?  No.  We're right across.  And your hand slips under her dress.  And say you're doing something with your finger.  And a little bald-headed guy is standing behind her, squeezing her butt like it's Charmin's  and his eyes are lit up.  Right?  And you have to look at this guy.  He's just squeezing her butt like.  How would the little guy be squeezing her butt if you're fingering her?  He's fingering her from the front. 
[03:22:30]  Right.  And he's squeezing her from the front.  But she knows.  She's been through this.  It's so dirty because it would be less dirty if you guys were actually having sex.  Oh, she's standing straight up.  Yeah.  But it's so dirty.  Like that's so perverted.  I didn't put my hand up her dress and squeeze it.  And she wasn't just disgusted by me, but she liked him, so she tolerated me.  Oh, God damn.  You know what I am?  I'm like, I always like Voss's shitty apartment.  Like, you like somebody enough, you'll fuck them in the apartment. 
[03:23:00]  I was the downside.  Then we're driving around.  I got about five of these.  But they're all fake stories.  We end up in Central Park.  They're just fake.  We end up in Central Park, right?  And, you know, she's on her knees going down on me.  Uh-huh.  And I look down, and you see Norton eating out her ass like it's chocolate candy, right?  And he's got his tongue up her head, right? 
[03:23:30]  And she's all right.  And I'm trying not to laugh.  You guys have a pretty good imagination.  Wow.  Imagine I was eating her ass so deep, I actually tickled Voss's cock handle with my tongue.  I doubt that.  Oh, God.  Oh, damn.  Love the imagination.  And then you're driving home, and you say to your little pal, oh, she ended up blowing Norton. 
[03:24:00]  I was like, you know, it was a consolation.  I said, look, I'll give you my CD if you blow him.  Swallow your saliva, and then carry on.  Oh, God.  So then you're driving home, and you go to Norton.  Did you have a good time?  He goes, yeah, but I was a little uncomfortable.  I didn't want to get my pants dirty.  And then you go, you'll eat out a strange girl's ass, but you care about getting your pants dirty.  I don't want to get his pants dirty.  He'll go home as well.  He'll say, look at the dirt on your knees.  Were you eating out strange ass again?  See, that's such an inconsistency.  The story can't possibly be true. 
[03:24:30]  Sounds fake to me.  Because why would a guy care if his pants are dirty when he's got his face buried in some woman's black ass?  Are joke writers.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they know how to put the twist on.  It's all a pitch for a new sitcom.  That's true.  It's a show called What Voss Does When She Finally Dumps Him.  But saying it was a true story.  Finally is getting closer and closer.  Until you get your papers.  Here's the thing. 
[03:25:00]  Say it's true.  Say it's true.  Two more years.  Say it was true.  It's just say a girl decided to go down on me.  It's not like a strange guy's never come up to you and went, you know.  What, ate me out in the bathroom after a show?  Ate you out in the bathroom after a show.  Just some guy, can I eat you out?  Wow.  And I have her tell me that story all the time.  I only did it because I wanted to feel like a dude, like a guy comic that a girl will go,  oh, you're really funny.  Can I blow you?  And a guy just said, can I eat you out?  No, he wanted to, that was the.  Eat out is the dumbest word for going down on pussy. 
[03:25:30]  I know.  He's got to say lick the baby maker.  He wants to get, even that's better than.  He wants to trick her into admitting something.  It's like you're actually tearing away flecks and swallowing it.  Don't tell me the story about the guy after the show.  Makes it funny.  She made out with me and she goes, he goes, can I just go down on your show?  Well, I want to hear Bonnie tell her.  It's hotter.  I want to hear you tell her.  I want to hear Bonnie tell her.  Okay, so I just finished the show.  Who are you wearing it?  Who was booking it?  Who was?  He saw you crying on the side.  Shut up.  Rich, let us work now. 
[03:26:00]  I don't know.  So what were you wearing?  I was wearing a men's button down baggy pants.  No bra, right?  Tell us no bra.  So he, I don't know.  He came up and he wanted to make out and stuff and I said no.  And then we decided that we would go into the bathroom and he would go down on me, but  nothing else would happen.  Like I wouldn't touch him in any way.  And so that's exactly, that's exactly what happened. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  But when I tell you to tell me the story, you have to touch him though in the story.  Tell me about your professor that you banged.  Shut up with this line of questioning.  Oh my God.  I didn't bang him.  You touched his, uh, what happened?  I tell you that for the story.  Wait, did Tony Montana come in the bathroom and beat up the guy?  That's how I get hard.  I go, tell me about the other guys you banged.  So what happened?  Who was the professor?  The professor, I don't know. 
[03:27:00]  I went into his office to, you know, get in trouble or whatever.  And he put, he had this huge plant and he put it by the door cause there was glass in  the door, you know?  I should have known someone was coming.  Yeah.  He was like getting ready.  So anyway, Ms. McFarlane.  Um, so, um, yeah, no, we fooled around a lot.  A lot?  Did it start there?  Professor.  He taught me how to, he was the guy who taught me how to give a blowjob.  Aw.  Wait, you said you fooled around a lot?  Did you blow him?  Or you, see, cause I'm getting hard as a rock right now. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, me too.  Holy shit, boss.  Wait a minute, Bonnie.  Now, hold on.  Was that the first time you two had fooled around or no?  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Did you know what was going to happen?  No, I had no idea.  So how did it happen?  How did it actually move?  That's a big move for him to go with his students.  It certainly is.  Well, what happened was I was, I kept missing class.  What did he profess in?  And he.  What was it?  It was, I don't want to.  You got her now.  He was going to say that, but you don't want to tell us.  He was a radio and television class.  Oh, of course.  What a scumbag.  He was a low, it was Edmonton, and he was a local. 
[03:28:00]  Junior high, by the way.  He had his own TV show, a sports show.  Oh, after you blew him, did he fly to Bangkok?  Oh, go ahead.  To John Carlson.  I was too old.  So tell us more.  So.  You put the plant in front of him.  I was, yeah, I came in late again, and I knew he was going to be mad at me, so I faked tears  and pretended that my mom was in the hospital, which was a total lie.  And then he wanted me to come to his office after, and so he started consoling me about  my mother, which wasn't true.  Wow, what a predator.  I know.  You saw an opportunity of a girl that might be in distress. 
[03:28:30]  Your mother fell.  Move the plant.  Yeah.  And then it started off by.  Let me teach you how to give a blowjob.  Did she fall on this?  I started sucking his fingers, and it progressed.  Wow, you started sucking his finger.  How did, what did he like, was he rubbing your face, maybe, gently, and you just kind of.  He was hugging me.  Yeah.  Did you feel him get turned on?  What's that?  Did you feel he had a heart on when he was hugging you?  I don't remember.  You know, it was like if a guy wanted to have sex with you, you just went through with it 
[03:29:00]  and got it over with.  You just went through with it?  What the hell is it?  Caveman days?  I know.  Did he have a big penis?  I know he asked you that, so I have to remember.  I don't remember.  Wow.  I don't know anything about it.  Oh, God, is that exciting.  Oh, your wrist getting all dirty.  I know.  He wishes he had a professor like that.  I wish I went to college.  Why don't you guys go have sex?  Huh?  Go have sex.  Where's she going to go?  What do you want?  I'm a couple.  Let's go to Jeff.  The girl started licking Voss's fingers and thought they were good and plenty. 
[03:29:30]  Jeff in Cleveland, what's up?  Hey, real quick.  When's Bonnie coming to Cleveland?  I'd love to see her act sometime.  Never.  Never?  Love to see her act, huh?  I don't know.  Anyway, to my call.  Hey, old N.E.W. story.  I don't know if it's true or not, but I remember you talking about Rich Voss and Jim Norton both laying on a bed, both stroking it.  There's a hooker in the middle.  There's a coin flip involved.  No hooker.  There wasn't a hooker.  There was no hooker?  Just you guys were in bed stroking it?  No, no, no. 
[03:30:00]  That's disgusting.  That's disgusting.  About two friends laughing.  That was a girl in the bed with us, and I go, all right, we'll flip a coin, and whoever loses has to bang her.  Is that the same girl where Rich was choking in the bathroom?  Why?  She was ugly?  No, no.  She was pretty.  She was just being funny.  Remember, this is another fake story.  Another joke.  Yeah, yeah.  And so he comes first.  I like how you put jokes within the fake story.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  He comes first.  He comes first.  You guys are so gross.  Mr. Selfish, while I'm laying on the bed, because it's hard for me with a guy in the room, goes into the bathroom. 
[03:30:30]  Unless the word bathroom's in front of it.  Go ahead.  So he goes in the bathroom, and I'm jerking off with this girl there.  Oh, he didn't just wipe off with a sock?  I'm trying to cum, and apparently she had a cat in the litter boxes in the bathroom.  And I'm trying to cum, and I hear, and he comes out and complains about the cat shit smell, and just starts having a conversation. 
[03:31:00]  Like, he's not fucking me up by doing that.  Did you manage to cum still?  I bet I did.  You betcha.  Guys are amazing.  There could have been a 20-year-old that came on to me.  Now, this one's not true.  Outside the cellar.  So, we're driving back to Norton.  Remember that?  No, but I imagine I would be driving while you're in the back seat. 
[03:31:30]  And he's driving.  And right, he's like the prom bus driver, staring in the back.  Just looking in the rearview mirror.  All right.  I'm doing two miles an hour.  And say we go back to his house, or whatever.  Well, say we first pull over, and I go, can I watch you guys make out?  And as you do, I jerk off looking in the rearview mirror.  I might throw up.  Why?  She was a professor. 
[03:32:00]  I was jerking off.  You guys are so close to being gay.  You know, it's weird.  We are gay.  You must have been so upset when Rich and I started dating.  He was.  I remember.  Couldn't be a part of it.  I remember.  He was very upset.  I knew Voss liked Bonnie.  Before they really dated, I knew he really liked this girl.  It wasn't even a thought to do that.  You're not going to look at her pussy, okay?  This is one that's awesome.  Voss is like, I'll tell you a story.  But you can't jerk off watching.  And say you're at his apartment, and the girl doesn't want to have anything to do with 
[03:32:30]  him again.  He starts spanking it.  And then you look over, and his load is laying on his face.  That is shot that high.  No, no.  I've heard stories, though.  I've never believed it.  And you're sitting, and it looks like there's a glue explosion on his face.  What stories have you heard?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  But that's possible, that you could shoot yourself in the face. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's hit the wall behind him.  I have hit the wall behind me.  I mean, when I'm laying down.  When I'm laying down, if I'm coming, and my toes are pointed straight out.  Fucking Superman?  The wall's right there.  I had a photograph I'll bring in, actually.  It was my wall of my old apartment over my head, where I fucking arced a load.  Do you ever masturbate on your stomach and go, okay, this is the time I'm going to taste it?  No, I've hit myself in the mouth, though.  Holy shit.  No.  I hit myself in the mouth.  Holy shit. 
[03:33:30]  And I.  This is the time I'm going to taste it?  No, I've watched.  I never have done that.  Holy shit.  But then after you're done, you're going to spook free again.  I'm not going to do it.  Don't just eat it.  I've blasted myself in the mouth and in the eye, completely accidentally, and it's awful. 
[03:34:00]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  But the funny thing is, let's just say that girl and I actually ran friends and stayed in  touch and hooked up a few more times.  Oh.  There you go.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Mike in Cold Lake.  I think that's somewhere in Canada, right?  Oh my God, that's, that can't be possible.  Welcome aboard, Mike.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, Mike.  How's it going?  Hey, Mike.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you.  I just wanted to say hi to Bonnie. 
[03:34:30]  I'm pretty sure she's from Cold Lake, too.  Yeah.  That's good action.  Yeah.  Do you know Bonnie?  I know her sister.  Please tell me you have a degree.  Which sister?  Audrey.  Oh, Audrey, yeah.  You keep this to yourself.  Oh, boy.  You're shaking a little bit.  I know, I will.  So I go, what does he know?  What is he?  Because I always think, like, oh, there's no way my family will ever hear any of this stuff.  Oh, it's Mike from Cold Lake.  Why?  We're all over Canada now. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, my God.  We were in Cold Lake, and not one person, we're up there, not one person recognized me or her.  Not one.  Then we finally, you know, we're killing time.  I go, let's go into this porno store and get some pornos, and I'm looking into pornos, you know.  And, of course, I'm at the men's section.  And the girl behind the counter, hey, you're the guy on, you know, on the last comic.  The one person.  She probably went, hey, I saw you.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  She's checking you out, though.  She doesn't mention that you bring your selection over.  And why were you in the men's section? 
[03:35:30]  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, okay.  Oh, hey, I remember you.  Yeah.  Oh, no, no.  Mike left us.  Aw.  Anybody else from Canada?  Just some dude rich.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, Bonnie, the sports content in Edmonton's not that good.  The broadcasters, is it like Brian Hall?  No, no, it's not.  Oh, well, if it was.  But it was close because the first name is right.  What's that?  Nothing.  Oh, wow. 
[03:36:00]  Dante.  People want to know how it went so quickly from Bonnie's hot story to Norton hitting himself  in his face with his own load.  That's the natural progression.  Like in a second, it changed.  That's what Dante wants to say.  Oh, really?  Dante.  Sorry, Dante.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, man.  Leave it to Voss to kill the moment.  Here it is.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm driving up the parkway with Bonnie's hot professor story.  And then Voss killed it with his own version of wanting to take his own cum.  No, first of all, the story was over with.  No, it wasn't. 
[03:36:30]  It really wasn't.  There were a couple of questions.  We were professional broadcasters.  We had 15 minutes we were going to go into.  I wanted to know what grade she got.  That's right.  Well, they keep going with the story.  I did very well.  He did help me out a lot.  We want to know what else happened with the professor.  How old was he?  How old was he?  Did he satisfy you?  Or did you just satisfy him?  No, there was...  Yes.  You just satisfied him.  That day?  Yeah.  That day and then days after.  Wow.  Days after.  What a treat.  We actually were at a restaurant where he was...  He did satisfy me.  He gave me a foot massage. 
[03:37:00]  Why didn't he ask to go down on you or something?  Why didn't he have to?  For reciprocation.  He didn't have to.  He kept it close.  I didn't know what I was doing too much.  So he just took his dick out and said, look, I'm going to show you something.  How did that happen?  No, I started sucking on his fingers.  Right.  And he was like, have you ever sucked on anyone's penis?  And I was like, no, God, no.  And he was like, people do that.  Hey, have you ever sucked on someone's penis? 
[03:37:30]  You know?  Did he use a sexy language as that?  But we got caught at this restaurant by one of the people in the class.  At a restaurant?  Oh.  Yeah, because he was giving me a foot massage.  Oh.  It was pretty obvious, I guess.  And then...  How old were you?  I was 19, 18.  How old did this go on for?  Hot.  Last week.  I don't know.  Not that long.  He got in trouble.  He almost got asked to leave.  I mean, we both kind of got in trouble.  We weren't allowed to use the editing suites alone anymore. 
[03:38:00]  Wow.  Thank God he didn't meet you 10 years earlier.  There would have been bigger problems.  All right.  Okay.  They don't do that in Canada.  Yeah.  You want a car crash me?  No, I know.  Actually, my cousin, Paul Bernardo.  I don't give you a satisfaction.  Your cousin.  Wait.  Now, wait a second.  Was he good looking?  A good looking guy?  I think I thought so at the time.  Well, he was on TV.  I mean, it was...  Rich.  Yeah.  This is the radio show, not talking about comedy.  Ew.  No, you're not talking about comedy.  See, I tried to talk him out of it, and he was like, no, people want to know about that.  No one can't get started. 
[03:38:30]  But you said don't do relationship stuff.  You wanted a Rita Rudner tape.  Is this relationship stuff?  No, I just didn't want...  I didn't want you to do something that's similar to Patrice, because he's doing a good job at  that, but you guys should tell stories that neither one have heard before.  I've heard them all in bed.  I make her tell them to me.  Oh, you haven't heard them all.  Oh, yeah.  The professor.  I can't tell him anymore, because of Mike from Cold Lake.  He might run into my dad, eh?  Well, no, tell...  Wait a minute. 
[03:39:00]  You're going to do a radio show about when you got started?  I explained that to you.  No, we were saying, you know, just different comedy and, you know, inspiration.  Well, forget.  Let's get back in this morning house.  See, no, I agree.  There's different comedy and inspiration?  No, what got you started, you know, who were your idols and stuff like that.  We talk comedy all the time when we sit around, so don't act like it's a dumb thing to talk  about.  Okay.  It's something we know about.  Okay?  I mean, we could, you know, maybe the second show we could tell sex stories or whatever. 
[03:39:30]  You know, it was the last minute you said, hey, do you want to do this?  What do you want to talk about?  Scott in Illinois.  Hey, everybody missed Opie's good line, which made the story really hotter.  When Bonnie said the name of her school, Opie said, junior high, by the way.  Punch it out.  Oh, thank you.  That was a great line.  What did he say?  Junior high.  Oh.  I just wanted to bring it down a little bit.  Yeah, that's...  Make it hotter for everybody.  So did he, like, did he ever, like, did you ever have sex in the classroom?  We never had sex.  You never had sex?  Because he was married with three kids, you know.  He was married?  He was married, yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, he was?  Yeah.  He was married or engaged, living with whoever she was.  And he, you...  Oh, God.  This is so exciting.  But no one wants to hear about this.  So, dude, the first time, what inspired you to go on?  What was the first comedy CD you bought?  Well, for me, it was when I fucked my teacher.  There you go.  Bonnie knows how to get them listening.  Jesus.  So, how did that first, like, session... 
[03:40:30]  I get a phone call.  I get a phone call.  And I'm going to need a Rita Rudner clip.  I'm like, ew.  For what?  That was a joke.  That was a joke.  I don't know.  It wasn't.  I'm on the phone.  You guys are driving.  I'm helping you.  I'm going to need Rita Rudner clips.  And who else?  Alan King.  Alan King.  And Von Meter.  Oh, God.  I don't even know who Von Meter is.  I know who he is.  He's a professor up in Canada.  How did that first session end?  That's what I want to know.  Like, it ends...  How did it end? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  I wiped up and left.  And left?  Like, was it awkward or weird for you?  No, I remember kind of feeling sort of, you know, powerful a little bit.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't feel bad.  I didn't feel, like, abused or anything.  You didn't feel dirty?  19.  No, I knew I could come in late now.  I knew I had a lot...  Ah.  Yeah, you're just walking in a glass.  Hey, asshole.  I'm not going to be here today.  I'm fucking...  Got shit to do. 
[03:41:30]  When you were sucking his finger, didn't you think something was up?  Like...  Oh, yeah.  No, I knew there was, like, a high sexual...  When he put the plant at the window, I sort of started thinking, like, what's that going  on here?  At 19, did you get wet?  I mean, there was, like, flirty conversation all, like, before this.  Yeah.  How much older was he?  He was probably late 20s.  Older man.  He was a man.  Yeah.  16.  He was 47.  I was 11.  I don't want to talk about it.  Please talk about it. 
[03:42:00]  What if he's listening right now?  What if he said you guys are going to bang during the break?  I would love to.  I don't know where.  Bathroom.  Bathroom.  We do it all the time.  Where's the last one?  Listen with the enthusiasm.  We do it all the time.  We did it at that show.  We did it at the art show.  Did you?  Yeah, while you were on stage.  Well, we watched the first half, and then we went downstairs in the dressing room.  Wait, because you told me you did that.  Yeah.  I said, Rich, don't tell anyone.  You went right away.  Bragging to everyone right away.  I didn't brag.  It was just cool to bang someone at the art center. 
[03:42:30]  Someone?  I mean, to bang someone.  Someone.  Someone.  Anyone.  I mean, my wife.  Great.  I put the plant in front of the door.  Where'd you guys do it?  In our dressing room.  She put the couch in front.  I wanted someone to walk in.  She didn't.  I would have been mortified.  What, if somebody walked in?  Oh, my God.  Would have been hysterical, though.  Horrible.  My pants around my ankles.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Who was on stage while you were banging?  I watched the first half, and then I go, I've heard this.  So then I said, let's go bang.  And we went.  No, we went.  Well, Jimmy was on stage?  Yeah, we were watching him. 
[03:43:00]  Jimmy gets me hot when I watch him.  Yeah, it just happens.  I prowl like a panther on the stage.  And then we went down to the dressing room.  He just did it when he was on stage, so Jimmy wouldn't come up and start squeezing  Bonnie's ass during the time you're fucking her.  It was like a safe bet.  If you could hear his ass still going on in the background, you know she's not going  to get molested by him.  Hey, we got a lot of questions for Bonnie coming in.  Candy Man.  Oh, shit.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  I got to call you all out on something, man.  Nobody asked Bonnie when she was talking about the professor. 
[03:43:30]  Did she sit or swallow?  Oh, good point.  I didn't think.  I didn't.  I didn't swallow.  What'd you do with it?  Into the plant.  Yeah.  That's why the plant was so big.  Yeah.  Lunch.  Come back to the next day.  The plant is dead.  What are you doing, boss?  You got to fuck now?  Oh, I can want to see what you see.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Ohio.  Jeff.  Why don't you get us some waters while we talk about this?  Oh, shit.  Look at you.  Jeff.  You guys asked if the professor had pleased her or he didn't have to because his grades 
[03:44:00]  weren't fucking miserably.  Good point.  What did he?  I didn't hear it.  He said, you guys, if the professor pleased her, he didn't have to because his grades  weren't fucking something.  I just laughed.  I knew where he was going.  We weren't fucking.  And the other thing is, you know, the whole thing with Norton going into the dressing room,  that would never happen because he doesn't want to get his knees dirty.  I knew.  I knew.  You should have stuck with the first one.  Why did you have to go for number two?  Now you negate it at all.  Gary Grady.  You ruined it.  Thanks for listening. 
[03:44:30]  A lot of people asking, why don't you guys just fuck on the air?  We'll just turn the lights off.  I would never do it.  You got the mirrors.  We could throw down the shades.  Why not?  Why wouldn't you do it?  Because you know why?  Because the reality of sex is not as good as...  No, we'll do.  It's like...  We'll take wireless mics and we'll sit on that couch.  I promise.  No way.  We'll lock the door and we'll just wait until you're done.  It's porn.  That's radio porn.  I would do it in a second. 
[03:45:00]  And that's a very accurate description.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  That's what you should do at 11 o'clock.  Good morning, boys.  Just have sex and let people listen in.  That's fuck.  Jim, you really don't want it to go any longer.  John.  What?  How did you penetrate that girl with your midget fingers?  That's it?  You waited in line to do that?  Well, I didn't kind of smash them with that.  All right, let's go to West Virginia.  Bill?  Hello, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Probably one of your only black listeners from West Virginia. 
[03:45:30]  But anyway, if Bonnie was eight...  Like, last time she said she was 18 when she first fingered herself.  So how old was she?  Like, how many guys had she had before this professor?  Were you a virgin?  No, no.  I already slept with like 55 or 60 guys by that point.  When he goes, I'm the only black listener, if he would have said, I was the professor,  I was almost going to have a heart attack.  Oh.  Well.  He was a black guy.  I had a black boyfriend before the professor.  I know. 
[03:46:00]  But he was light-skinned, right?  You said?  He was very white.  Canadian.  He was Canadian.  Why did I just get tired?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Gee.  What?  Just waving to Bobby.  All right, well.  No, I wasn't a virgin, by the way.  At what time?  Oh, you were 8, 19?  I had sex before I first masturbated.  Wow.  How old were you?  When I first masturbated?  No sex.  17? 
[03:46:30]  Oh.  Fucking old.  Old maid.  No, they used to write tighty on my locker.  Because, you know, I grew up in a very small...  What does tighty mean?  Like tight?  Tight.  Like a tight.  Like tight, like I was still a virgin.  Like it was so horrible.  Yeah, that's horrible.  Tenth grade to still be a virgin.  But in my school, they started having sex.  I don't know if that's just because it was this really small town where there was nothing  else to do, but everyone was having sex all the time.  So you weren't doing anything?  Handies?  Anything?  No, I didn't.  I was very mature. 
[03:47:00]  Good girl?  Yeah.  No, not really, but...  I remember the first girl...  Oh, 17.  When I was...  Well, 17, I, you know...  When I was really young, this girl, you know, we were all trying to have sex.  We never got laid.  We were like 15 or 16.  So I take this girl and she says, I'm begging her.  And she said, look, I'll blow you.  I go, no, no, I want to have sex because I never had it.  Wow.  So...  You're just going to completely...  Well, then I put the rubber...  Behind door number two.  Let's make a deal, yeah.  You're giving up the blow job in hopes of talking her into sex. 
[03:47:30]  So we're in the woods and I got...  I put the rubber on.  I didn't know how to do it.  I couldn't put it in.  Like, I didn't know how.  Like, I was 16 or 15.  25, 16.  And I couldn't do it.  I didn't know how to do it.  So I go, well, were you blowing it?  And she said, no.  Oh, we'll send you home at a consolation prize.  Jerk off, idiot.  You didn't know how to do it.  I'm not sure, like, what you mean.  Look, I didn't know...  There was a pussy and there was, like, you were there.  I didn't know...  Listen, I didn't know how to...  I was young.  I never did it.  You didn't know how to lay or whatever. 
[03:48:00]  When I was 16, I knew where my dick was.  So I didn't have a guy under a porch teaching me.  I didn't know how to lay down and do it.  There's no need to bring that up.  That was very hurtful.  You know, that was a childhood thing.  I was just an over-sex kid.  I never got laid.  I masturbated.  You ever...  Like, I remember one time when, like, I took a buttered roll.  Okay, now, before you get into this story, do I really want to tell this?  A buttered roll.  Ask yourself.  Well, it didn't start out that way. 
[03:48:30]  Start out as just a roll.  This is the show at 11, you idiots.  You'd have the whole country and Canada listening.  No, I disagree.  I disagree completely.  Well, Alan King...  What was your favorite Alan King bit as a kid?  If you listen to Rita Ryder's Cadence, the timing is impeccable.  Well, you said don't talk.  I'll talk sex.  I don't know.  I mean, it's...  No, just don't do it like Patrice's.  I never heard Patrice's more of a relationship thing.  Yeah, you guys got your own thing going on. 
[03:49:00]  This is just talking about, you know...  Yeah, there's no, uh...  I don't know.  The innocence of...  The innocence of youth and growing up and stuff.  Well, we didn't prepare for that, but the next one, we'll do that one or something.  We'll have to prepare to marry.  Just start talking.  For a show?  Pat in Boston, what's up?  What the fuck does that?  Jesus.  Hey, uh, Rich.  Quick question for you.  I just want to know how Bonnie's supposed to taste.  Is it, like, one of the best you've ever tasted?  Oh, my God.  How do people know these stories?  You told them.  You ghost. 
[03:49:30]  I didn't...  Did we tell that on this show?  Yep.  Wait, what?  Oh, what up?  What story?  I forget.  Right at the very...  Rich and I started having sex before we started really talking to each other.  And, um...  Interesting.  And then, uh...  So that went on for a few months.  And then one night, I called him, and I don't know why, but I had his phone number, and I  called him, and he was on the road somewhere, and he thought I called for phone sex, which  I didn't.  I just called to say hi.  But then I was too embarrassed to be that girl that, oh, I just called the chat. 
[03:50:00]  So I went through with it, and during the phone sex, this is, you know, a fantasy.  He goes, oh, you've got one of the best-tasting pussies.  Oh, yes.  One of?  Yeah, I had to go, let it go, and just come.  Like, just don't let it falter.  What an ass.  One of.  I know.  So after that, I busted his arm.  Rated the top five pussy.  I know, totally.  I was like, doesn't that make me fifth?  Um, so, uh, then we actually talked for like an hour after that, and that's when we really 
[03:50:30]  started to...  Fall in love.  All right.  God, I cannot wait to go home and listen to that professor's story.  Oh, you're going to jack off to it, are you?  Wait, what I...  Oh, forget it.  Oh, you're stuttering.  What do you have, his penis in your mouth again?  Ooh.  No, she's got something, but...  She's getting a little hot and bothered.  No.  What do you got, Bonnie?  Forgive my salty talk.  No, because when I tell him the stories, I have to embellish. 
[03:51:00]  So then it gets mixed up in my head what's really real or not.  All right, we'll take a break.  A long break.  Does he ever make you tell who had the biggest penis?  No, because...  Well, I don't hear that.  Yeah, he doesn't...  Because why?  Because why?  Why?  He wants to hear the fucking Professor Blowjob story, but doesn't want to hear who's got the  bigger...  Out of her boyfriend's, I don't mind, but not out of her one-night stands.  Because he wants to hear, this is one of the biggest penises I've ever had. 
[03:51:30]  He's got pictures of it in his wallet.  Rich has got the biggest penis of anyone I've ever slept with.  No way.  Yes, it is.  I know guys you've slept with, and there's no way I'm bigger than them.  You don't know guys I've slept with.  Please.  Wait, are you kidding me?  I haven't worked every club in this country?  Oh, shit.  No.  I didn't start doing clubs until I met you.  Wait, what's the biggest penis of anybody you've ever slept with?  All right.  That's not true.  Why is he a pedophile?  My professor was seven. 
[03:52:00]  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss.  Hey, it's primetime Sam Roberts with some bonus Voss for you.  During the recording sessions, Voss is easily distracted when Bonnie calls.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You know, I started thinking about my dumbness.  I'm not, you know, sometimes in studio I might say a couple of dumb things, and sometimes  I might make a mistake.  One, people don't know it's quite early in the morning.  Two, usually I'm doing this with two hours sleep. 
[03:52:30]  Three, I don't have a high school education.  So there are factors that, you know, all come together for this.  But believe you me, I'm fucking smart when it comes to a lot of things.  Okay?  I used to run my own business.  Okay?  I used to have a big fucking painting business, you know, when I was 22.  But the painting business didn't last because I was scared of heights and I wouldn't climb  a ladder.  So as a painter, you know, it's not good when you only paint one-story houses. 
[03:53:00]  You know, I'll paint the bottom half of your house, but I'm not climbing a fucking ladder.  You know, and I did a lot of coke, too, so I wouldn't pay the employees.  Whatever.  But what I'm saying is, you know, I know a lot about a lot of shit.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm telling you that.  Believe you me, I did my fucking closets over.  And I did all the work myself.  I made extra room because I buy a lot of clothes.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Shut up and listen.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Rich Voss.  Voss and we're back.  We're the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:53:30]  This is name that actor.  This is, oh, this is where I look at photos.  And you know what it is?  I'm not really into that whole pop culture bullshit.  Bonnie is.  Bonnie, you know, she reads all those magazines.  Just last night we were sitting in bed and she was reading magazines.  You know, I'm fucking her.  But she was reading magazines.  And I go, can you at least pretend you're fucking me?  You know, she knows.  I don't know these people.  I know.  Like if I see a picture of Dustin Hoffman or Robert De Niro, that's who I know. 
[03:54:00]  I mean, I know some of the famous people.  I'll recognize some.  But I don't know these new fucking actors.  I just look at a movie now.  Either you're really famous or I don't fucking know you.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, like I know Forrest Whitaker because, you know, because of the eye or, you know, like whatever.  But I looked at these pictures and I might have made a couple mistakes with their names.  That's all.  But how could you not make mistakes with their names if you don't know their names?  Do you see what I'm saying? 
[03:54:30]  That's like a guy walking down the hall.  What's his name?  I don't know.  You know, I recognize him and I'll fuck up his name because I don't know it.  So that's really.  This shouldn't have been a bit.  It's just I didn't really know the names.  Okay.  Some of it's funny.  They'll listen to it.  I kind of remember it now.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  How can we never find a real hot transvestite?  They're always like six foot seven.  Because they're men.  No, but when you watched a movie, what was the movie? 
[03:55:00]  Wesley Sipes and.  Wesley Sipes.  I said Sipes.  No, you didn't.  We all laughed when you said it.  We all laughed when you said it.  We all laughed when you said it.  We all laughed when you said it.  We all laughed when you said it.  We all laughed when you said it.  And here you say Wesley Sipes.  No, I said Sipes.  You said Wesley Sipes.  Wesley Sipes.  And Legazamo.  Legazamo.  I'll have some of the Legazamo, please.  Wesley Sipes.  What's up?  Oh, God.  Voss, I wish we had just had a live feed into your brain so we didn't have to go through 
[03:55:30]  the bullshit of your mouth getting out the words.  Listen to me.  Yeah.  He was dressed.  One of them was a little transvestite and not bad looking as a transvestite.  You're talking about Tuong Fu.  Who was it?  And that was Patrick Swayze-ly.  No.  Wesley Sipes.  And John Legazamo.  Patrick Swayze-ly.  No.  Not that movie.  There was a movie with Wesley and Legazamo. 
[03:56:00]  Look at that.  That's called Tuong Fu.  Find the picture.  With also Patrick Swayze-ly.  It was Tom cruising.  Tanner in Fargo writes, hey, give Rich a list of celebrity names to read off.  That's brilliant.  Can we get a nice little list of obvious ones?  Well, if he reads them, that's different.  It's got to come from his stupid head.  No, I don't think he can read either.  Mike Verbiglia.  We got the first celebrity.  Who is this?  Rich Voss. 
[03:56:30]  Pierce Bronson.  I knew he was going to say that.  What?  Did I get it right?  I got it right.  No, no, no, no, no.  I got it right?  You got it right.  See?  Now punch up Charles Bronson.  Bronson.  Right.  I am with you.  Seriously.  I just laughed so hard I got a head rush.  I almost passed out.  For real.  I'm not even joking.  All right.  Find another one, Danny.  Here's Bronson.  Here's Dino.  I got it right.  Yes.  One for one.  Brosnan.  We just laughed. 
[03:57:00]  Oh, it's Brosnan?  It's Pierce Brosnan.  Nobody would know that.  That's true.  We all know.  Everyone that's seen any of his movies would know that.  Who's that?  All right.  Who is that?  He was in Brokeback Mountain.  Donnie Darko.  I have no idea.  Just give me his first name.  I might get it.  Jarhead.  What's his first name?  I might get the last name.  His first name is Jake.  Oh.  Dillenworth or something.  Jake.  Something.  Dillenworth.  It's got a couple names on the end of it. 
[03:57:30]  Dillenworth, right?  Dillenworth.  It's like.  He's got a couple names.  The Greenwich Dillenworth.  This is the best game we ever played.  I love this game.  I find another one.  Find another one.  Steve from Bayshore.  The rules.  Steve, tell Brett to give you a free beer this weekend.  Jake Dillenworth.  He's making up actors.  He's got two names to last name.  Pierce Bronson and Jake Dillenworth in an all new movie. 
[03:58:00]  He's got two.  Coming this summer.  See, I don't know these guys.  Bonnie knows them all.  I don't know.  But he has two last names, right?  Does he?  I don't know.  Give us suggestions.  Dillenhouse or something.  Yes.  Dillenhouse.  Dillenhall or Gillenhall.  I've heard two ways it could be pronounced.  What is it?  I've heard Jake Gyllenhall.  I think that's pretty accurate.  Oh, I was close.  Dillenworth?  Dillenworth. 
[03:58:30]  Dillenworth is not in the ballpark.  No.  You just had one syllable correct and it was the middle one.  All right, we got another.  There's another actor.  See, I don't know.  Oh, wow.  He's a good actor.  Yes, he is.  He was in Boiler Room.  Yes.  Yes, Boiler Room.  He was in.  Just give me his first name.  No.  No.  I don't know.  No, I think you're okay.  Giovanni.  Oh.  Ooh.

Giovanni Ribisi.  One of the stars.  Close.  Yeah.  It rhymed.  One of the stars of Jaws.  Jaws.  This should be an easy one.  All right, who's that?  Oh, please.  That's easy.  I won't fuck that up.  Roy Scheidner. 
[03:59:30]  Roy Scheidner.  Scheidner.  Roy Scheidner.  I was sure he was going to go with Roy Schneider.  He was in Seven Ups, too.  Yes, he was.  Yes, Roy Scheidner.  Scheidner.  I said it.  Scheidner.  Yeah.  See?  The other ones are like, you know, I know the movies.  It's Scheidner.  Roy Scheidner.  Great actor.  I'm not fucking these up on purpose.  You know, some of them you just don't know.  No, you don't have to sell us. 
[04:00:00]  You don't have to sell anybody.  Believe me, I know you're not fucking these up on purpose.  Trust me.  When we're not sure, we'll push it for the people out there.  We don't have to push this one.  Holy shit.  Oh, God.  He'll never get that one.  Who?  He'll never get that one.  Go ahead.  There's an easy one.  Way of the Gun.  Yeah.  Good movie, right?  Great.  Sarah was good in that.  Yeah, she was good.  In the beginning, she gets punched in the fucking face.  Don't they call him like the Latin Brad Pitt or something, too?  Yeah, or something like that.  Latino Brad Pitt. 
[04:00:30]  Just trying to make a visual out there for everybody.  It's something Del Torio.  Uh-huh.  Give me the letters for the first name.  No, no.  Just the first initial.  First initial.  What's the first initial of his first name?  You got it.  You're there.  Go.  You were very close.  You almost just said it.  Del Torio.  Fucking, uh, I don't, what's it?  Benicio.  Benicio Del Torio.  It's so robust.  Benicio. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, you can even say it.  Yeah, you can.  You can say it.  Wait.  You know, with zing and.  Sounded like Bugs Bunny on the line.  Benicio Del Torio.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  Yeah, that's good.  Very good.  Yeah, here's another actor for Rich Voss.  There you go.  I'll try to wrap up.  Sopranos.  Soprano guy.  He was in, uh.  He was in Memento.  He was also in Baby's Day Out, I think.  He was in Risky Business.  Risky Business.  Much younger.  Goonies.  He was Guido the Killer Pimp.  Yeah.  I, I, in, uh. 
[04:01:30]  I remember he got, uh, uh, uh.  Tony Soprano's sister killed him on the show, right?  Yeah.  That's the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I have no clue.  He was hitting a bowling ball bag.  Yeah.  I have no clue.  I, I.  First name.  Even if I knew his name, I couldn't fuck it up.  What?  First name.  I, I couldn't tell you.  Frank?  Bill?  I'm actually having a loss.  I'm, I'm, I'm having a mental block as to his name.  Joe?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Uh.  Oh, Jesus.  Joe?  Oh, oh.  Uh, my.  Oh, no, no. 
[04:02:00]  That's the other one.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Oh.  It begins with a P, I think.  Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, yes.  Nice.  Joe?  It begins with a P.  Rich is, by the way, Rich is having a stroke.  You're, you're just fucking.  Oh.  Like Pablano or something.  Yes.  Pablano.  Joe Pablano.  Let's just leave it at that.  It's Joe Pablano.  Joe Pab.  I don't know if it's.  Joe Pab smear.  Yeah.  Joe P something.  It's with a P, though. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  That's good.  Oh.  Good enough.  Good enough.  Rich.  What's his name?  See, you're not correcting.  You're not saying the name, so we know how.  Why would I?  This isn't fucking school.  Yeah.  It's making fun of you.  This isn't like we're here to.  So it's probably a school.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  Five one more.  It's too good.  No, but what's his name?  You got it.  No worries.  Pablano.  There we go.  All right.  Yeah, here's a good one.  Ah, he knows that one.  Oh, I know him because I worked with him.  All right.  You worked with this guy.  Some of the films.  With the cleanest pool.  Yeah.  That's easy. 
[04:03:00]  He was in Fargo.  Steve Buscemi.  I'm not going to fuck that up.  All right.  That Buscemi is really rough.  He sounds like Steve Buscemi in Fargo after he was shot in the face.  He was shot in the fucking face.  Steve Buscemi.  And he's a nice guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Full metal jacket.  Come on.  The Private Pile.  I wouldn't even know his name.  He's on the toilet.  You know it.  All you'd have to hear is like a piece of his name.  I don't fucking think I know his name either.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  I don't know.  He looks like a bloated Norton. 
[04:03:30]  Who the fuck is it?  What's his first name?  I don't know these guys.  I know the movie.  I'll give you the first letter or the first name.  You're upset because I don't know his name.  First.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  It reminds me of when I was in second grade in speech class and I quit, obviously.  Yeah.  Second grade speech class.  Where?  V.  V.  V.  What the fuck?  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  I have no clue.  His name is Vincent.  Vincent.  Who? 
[04:04:00]  I have no clue.  I don't know his name.  No one knows his name.  He's been in one movie.  No.  What are you kidding?  How many fucking movies has he been in that?  That you know him from.  Without looking up IMDB.  He was in, let's see, Men in Black.  He's been on TV for the last.  No, I said a movie.  How many years?  Ten years probably.  Yeah, it's one of those Law and Order shows.  I don't know which one.  He's not on any fucking Law and Order shows.  I watch them all.  He's a huge star on TV.  I don't watch show either, but it's Law and Order, one of those shows.  Then it's maybe CSI or something, not Law and Order. 
[04:04:30]  He's been on Criminal Intent since 2001.  Okay, there you go.  Wow.  It's a long show.  What's the matter with you?  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, that's the end of the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  I was your host, Rich Voss.  Go to richvoss.com.  Remember, I'll be coming up at Governor's out in Long Island.  I got tons of dates coming up.  They're all on my website, richvoss.com.  And you know what? 
[04:05:00]  Maybe I'll see you at one of the gigs.  Anyhow, this was kind of fun.  It was all right.  I guess I got to say it was okay.  I'm not going to lie.  I think it was all right.  It was all right.  All right, I got to go.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're out.  I'm out.  I was the only one here today.  You guys were great.  Peace out.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm out of this bitch.  What's up with that?  Did you see that jerk? 
[04:05:30]  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's Primetime Sam Roberts with some bonus Voss for you.  Just because Rich is done with the show does not mean we are.  The following are some voice tracks that were alternated versions of the ones that we did use and some tracks we didn't.  E-Rock, you really did a good job writing this for me.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Rich Voss is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:06:00]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am E-Rock.  And Primetime Sam Roberts is over there.  You betcha.  And we're joined by legendary comedian Rich Voss.  Legendary only in this room right now.  No, I am.  You know what?  I'm known as a comics comic.  I'm quoted throughout the business.  I might make a couple of fuck-ups on the radio, but believe you me, Rich Voss has a great reputation as a comic.  I'm not going to bullshit you.  I've heard everybody says you're terrible on the radio and great on stage.  No, I'm not terrible on the radio. 
[04:06:30]  That's just another bullshit.  I can give you seven years of some of the most classic bits from when I was on here.  Honestly, if you were terrible on the radio, would you be this big of a part of the special show?  No.  No, you got to the V's.  Right?  Yeah, that's true.  We've been doing this for a while, but...  Rich said he only had a couple fuck-ups, so this is one of them.  It's Rich Voss' new flavors.  Somehow the show was discussing...  Discussing.  Is that the correct term?  I'm turning into Rich.  We were talking about... 
[04:07:00]  What I'm trying to say here is...  We were discussing corn nuts for some reason and how awful they taste,  and Rich seemed to be amazed that people knew about corn nuts because he thought they were relatively new.  No, no, no, that's where you're wrong.  The flavors, like how they had the salt and vinegar and the barbecue...  That's where this leads into,  because they were trying to figure out how you thought corn nuts were new,  and you said, no, no, no, flavors are relatively new,  and then the bit just took off from there.  Well, yeah. 
[04:07:30]  Do you think salt and vinegar potato chips just came out of nowhere?  What's a potato chip?  What's a potato chip?  Potato chip.  Did I say potato?  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  You're just trying to get another blunter here.  No, the problem is barbecue potato chips have been around for a while sometimes.  I didn't bring up barbecue.  I said salt and vinegar.  They've been around a very long time.  And pickled garlic.  Or pickled ones.  Or ketchup potato chips.  They're all new.  We can't get into this here.  We can't get into this debate because it's already happened. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah, and I stand my fucking ground on this one.  And you're wrong.  We're talking about some of the biggest blunders right now as this part of the show,  and what we're going to play now is you giving out your password on the air.  That was a mistake.  It was not just like...  Quite the mistake.  At first, you thought you were giving your Twitter username.  Yes.  Somebody called in to announce that that was actually your password.  How smart they are, the listeners.  They don't let anything get by them. 
[04:08:30]  We all started trying all your different things and realized you had the same password for most  of your online accounts.  Well, you know how I look at it is I'm a creature of habit.  Yes.  Okay?  You know what I'm saying?  Why just boggle up the mind with all kinds of different passwords?  Yeah.  Pick one and then give it to everybody across the nation.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  Because if my name ever comes up at a password convention or something, they'll go Comic630.  He works with us, too. 
[04:09:00]  I think at one point, Danny owned your Twitter, Travis owned your Facebook, and I owned your  email.  And you know what?  You guys are doing a great job running it now.  Thank you.  Yes.  Let me just point out, please tell me you've changed your password since then.  Yes, I did to Comic631.  Don't look at me like I'm crazy.  You gave it out on the air and you just did it again.  So I'm just making sure you've changed it.  Whoever was running my Facebook put up a lot of gay advertisements. 
[04:09:30]  That would be Travis.  A lot of gay.  And then I get an email from my daughter that night saying, is there anything you'd like  to tell me?  Okay.  So there was a lot of gay advertising.  I wouldn't take them off because it's a good cause.  Yeah.  And plus, maybe it'll endear you to the Hollywood community a little bit, too.  What I'm trying to say is, you have to expand your horizons.  Horizons.  I almost said horizons.  I should have let you.  Horizons.  You have to expand your horizons.  Rich in the studio with his then girlfriend, Bonnie McFarlane. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  That's before she was your wife when things were still fresh and new.  Buying cars on eBay.  Taking her around the town.  If you could only look into the future.  You know, it's so weird.  If I had to do it all again, I would have picked a better car on eBay.  You know, I look back at that time when I first met Bonnie.  It's when I rode on the Oscars and I got the gift basket.  So I was just taking her everywhere with all these free dinners and certificates and vacations. 
[04:10:30]  And she thought she hit the lottery.  And then the basket was just getting smaller and smaller.  Now it's down to, hey, look, I got you a coffee pot.  So your idea at the time is you're taking her out, all these nice restaurants, these vacations.  You're going to be driving to Rolls Royce.  It's like, it's like, I felt like some like fucking rapper.  But then the basket runs out and the Rolls Royce is not as described.  So let me tell you something.  I went from rags to Richard. 
[04:11:00]  Richard?  Well, rags to back to.  Rags to riches to rags.  You know what I'm saying?  What I'm saying is I went from rags to riches to Richard.  No, no.  And that's the worst.  The worst.  What the fuck is it with you?  Of Opie and Anthony.  Are you professional or not?  Listen to Opie and Anthony live and uncensored.  Weekday mornings from 6 to 11 a.m.  Oh, good for you.
