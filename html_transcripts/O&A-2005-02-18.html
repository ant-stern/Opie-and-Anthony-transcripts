<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the AC/DC song "Highway to Hell" and the usual show announcements.  Opie and Anthony's banter immediately devolved into graphic discussions of their bowel habits, medical procedures like colonoscopies and suppositories, and a detailed comparison of the technological advancements in colonoscopy equipment to those of cell phones.  Numerous callers added their own graphic accounts of medical experiences, including disturbing colonoscopy and transrectal ultrasound stories.  Brother Joe's musical career and upcoming gig in Puerto Rico were also mentioned.  A listener emailed about an interest in a lesbian encounter with the hosts.  Pat from Munaki was mentioned as being present to do the news, but wasn't heard during this segment.  The segment concluded with more discussion of bowel movements and a promise to reinstate more risqu√© content.

Following a ski report by Chuck Devine, the hosts discussed a news story about the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa firing overweight cocktail waitresses.  Other news topics included Bill Cosby's legal situation, the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry, and Mets ticket sales.  A lengthy Bill Cosby stand-up routine about skiing was played and analyzed.  Pat from Munaki's disastrous news segment followed, filled with awkward silences and poorly delivered jokes.  Audio clips of sex scenes from *Monsters Ball* and *Swimming Pool* were played, and a discussion about a code word for studio emergencies ("It's hot in here") ensued.  The segment concluded with discussion of Starker Patty's financial situation and internet usage, plus a mention of recording a MiFi commercial.

A segment featuring a woman named Patty involved her looking through a Hustler magazine and graphically describing the sexual acts depicted, with the hosts' explicit prompting.  A running joke centered on Patty's perceived lack of sexual experience.  It was revealed that Patty had previously made custom nameplates for Opie and Anthony, which were sold on eBay for $770 to Tony Rivoli, owner of Rivoli's Restaurant in Tom's River, New Jersey.  Rivoli was brought into the studio, gave Opie and Anthony the money, and they in turn gave Patty $40 (later increased) for her efforts.  A "Let's Make a Deal"-style game followed, culminating in Patty crawling naked across the studio floor (wearing a Krusty the Clown mask) for $200.  This segment also featured a song by Brother Joe about internet pornography.


A subsequent "Let's Make a Deal"-style game involved "Stalker Patty," who had already won $570.  The remaining $200 was earned through a vulgar challenge: the hosts and studio guests threw cherry darts at her exposed buttocks with whipped cream, with suggestions of using a glove and KY jelly. The segment included numerous insults, homophobic and racist remarks, a poorly-read news segment by Pat from Munaki, listener phone calls, and the debut of a new Ramon promo.  A ski and snowboard report and several audio advertisements also aired.  Stalker Patty ultimately won the $200.


The final segment began with discussion of upcoming show events like a trip to Los Angeles and a celebrity poker tournament, mentioning potential guests like Bill Shatner, James Woods, and Ozzy Osbourne.  A caller named Celeste detailed her polyamorous relationship, providing a website address (which proved to be unrelated) and later alternative email addresses for pictures.  A listener, Tom, called in with a "What Did I Learn" segment about a trip to Atlantic City to see Jimmy Norton.  The hosts commented on pictures Celeste sent.  The show concluded with a replay of a previously aired bit, "They Call My Name's Bill," and promotional announcements.

[00:04:30]  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites to fight the forces of evil.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With Opie.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Act, act.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like curly-spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious. 
[00:05:00]  Whenever Steve yawns, it looks like the back of the Batmobile and it accelerates.  Pauketosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers.  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  It's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony. 
[00:05:30]  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here. 
[00:06:00]  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  Okay.  Terrific.  You would have an enormous response to me.  Mom, please stop calling me.  You're not being fair.  This isn't fair.  Mom, I'm not the Lord.  I have to do this now. 
[00:06:30]  You have something to say.  I have something to say.  All right, so let's just talk.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Stop, oh, stop, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I can't reach.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Put her sock in the floor.  Or else you'll be out of here like shit through a goose.  Cool.  I've got my taser here. 
[00:07:00]  This taser has 80,000 volts worth of electrical current.  I'll just show you this wheel.  Pure power.  That's terrific! That's terrific! 
[00:07:30]  Oh!  Oh, fuck!  I don't care. I don't care. I honestly don't care. I don't care. 
[00:08:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hello.  Is it Friday?  Yes, it is.  Oh, effin' Friday.  Nice.  I love Friday.  I could sleep, I could go out, I could do whatever I want for a whole day.  But then Saturday, you gotta try to get back into the swing of the schedule. 
[00:08:30]  Hell no, man. Friday and Saturday.  Friday and Saturday?  Yeah!  No, by Saturday I'm already thinking, oh, Monday.  And then I even push it Sunday night, I stay up till 10 o'clock.  Wow!  Yeah.  You're an animal.  I'm crazy.  I was in bed.  In bed.  By 5.30 in the afternoon yesterday.  In bed.  Asleep by 6.  I fell asleep watching Seinfeld.  That's it.  You know, we start this show every morning talking about our sleep patterns. 
[00:09:00]  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  Because, you know, just the day before yesterday, I was asleep like 11.30 at night.  And that's why I was exhausted.  And I go home, and I'm just kind of walking around the house like, what?  What am I doing?  I'm not going to do anything.  I'm a zombie.  Screw it.  I'm going to bed.  Going to bed!  What?  It's light out.  Stupid afternoon TV shows are on.  And I'm in bed!  I'm in bed!  You brought up a great point in the office. 
[00:09:30]  Because, you know, we used to have such normal lives and...  Normal?  It was extreme the other way.  Not really, though.  For me, it was.  Yeah, but at least you got a good night's sleep every night.  Oh, yeah.  I'm talking about not normal, like talking about partying.  I used to...  Going out.  I used to poop regularly, and now my whole body's messed up.  I don't know when to sleep.  I don't know when to crap.  I used to crap in the morning.  Clockwork?  Like clockwork.  I would wake up around 7 o'clock, three dumps within 15 minutes, 
[00:10:00]  done for the day.  Done!  Now I'm dumping at five in the afternoon.  Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night.  Your schedule's all screwed up.  Some days I go two or three days without even dumping.  The sleep pattern's ridiculous.  You gotta have some of those smoothies.  I'm working on it, man.  I'm definitely loosening you up.  I'm actually going to the doctor today, because I can't take it anymore.  I'm heading out to Long Island.  I'm going to the doctor.  Really?  Oh, man.  I gotta start dumping regularly again.  Uh-oh. 
[00:10:30]  He might...  Whatever, dude.  Whatever he has to do.  The old digit.  And then the pipe.  I don't care if he has to strap on a freaking plastic glove, man.  Just take care of the problem.  Take care of it.  Fix it.  I mean, I would love to tell you what comes out of me.  It's ridiculous.  No.  Floaters.  I haven't had a mushy one in a month.  Oh, God!  Stop it!  Yeah.  And then I'll wake up today at 3 in the morning.  It's just like, what? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Well...  I used to be such a regular dude, man.  I used to go to bed at the same time.  Get up.  Everything was fine.  This lifestyle is...  It's impossible to get used to.  And like I said, 5.30.  I was asleep by 6.  And then the problem with that is you will wake up.  I will not be able to sleep from 6 o'clock at night all the way through till 4.15 or whatever  the hell time I'm getting up.  So, 2 times during the night I woke up.  And you have to try... 
[00:11:30]  It's so hard, but you gotta try to stay in the zone.  In the sleep zone.  You can't be distracted by what's on the television if that's on.  You can't start thinking about something.  I can't glance over to the laptop and think, eh, a couple of hands of poker or something like that.  You gotta stay half asleep.  And just go, alright, you're awake, but just go back to sleep.  Don't get into the awake mode.  You tell the truth, man.  Because I wake up in the middle of the night to take leaks sometimes.  Yeah.  And I make sure I don't open my eyes all the way. 
[00:12:00]  I just keep them barely open.  I have dimmers, so I keep it...  Keep it on dark.  Yeah, I don't turn any lights on and I'm just feeling around for the bowl.  I'm like, alright, you're actually still sleeping.  Right, right.  I'm still asleep.  Don't think about the show.  Don't do anything else.  Don't open your eyes wide.  Don't turn on lights.  Don't see what's in the refrigerator.  No, no, no.  Don't leak and stumble back into bed.  And then you get back into bed and you're like, ah, I did it.  Okay, I'm tired. 
[00:12:30]  I'll be able to get back to sleep.  It's a chore.  This lifestyle is a chore.  I think it'll get better, though.  I don't think so.  We're still very early into this damn thing, you know?  I don't think so.  We'll see.  You know what it is?  There's no consistency.  If there was some kind of consistency where I was actually going to sleep the same time,  well, I wake up at the same time, but going to sleep the same time every night.  It's one thing.  But I'll go to sleep, you know, after midnight sometimes, or midnight.  And that's awful.  You know, you wake up and you're just shot. 
[00:13:00]  And then do that for a couple of days, you're completely exhausted, and then you're asleep by 6 o'clock at night.  So it screws everything up, and I bet that's a big part of your physical problem.  Well, I'll find out today.  I'll have a full report on Monday.  A full effin' report.  I don't care what the guy does.  I'm just going to get the stink finger.  Honestly, I don't care, dude.  At this point, do what you have to, man.  Violate me.  I don't care.  The last time.  I just don't care. 
[00:13:30]  I don't care.  I don't care.  You've got to stop it.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  Oh, my God.  He's doing it forever.  I don't care.  The last time I got the digit.  I never got the digit.  It was when I was a little kid.  I was at the Neverland Ranch, and I was on the merry-go-round.  No, I must have been, like, I probably ate a big thing of bubblegum and swallowed it or something,  and I was all backed up, and the pediatrician, Dr. Fuchs, this German woman, 
[00:14:00]  gave me this suppository, and I was, I guess, like seven years old, pinned me down, loop it up, and . . .  I was a seven-year-old kid.  It was a horror show.  I'm like, ah!  It felt like, you know, you can imagine what goes on at the Jackson Ranch over there.  But it was horrified.  And then a couple of hours later, just, you know, something that should not come out of a seven-year-old. 
[00:14:30]  It's like the Hindenburg in the toilet.  That's funny, man.  But that was it, you know?  Yeah.  And I know the second I go to a doctor for a checkup or something, it's going to be, you know, the old rubber glove.  Do we have Brother Joe's pipes on?  The pipe?  Where is the pipe?  I'm starting to think I might be heading for the pipe.  You know, if you're backed up like that, you're probably a candidate for the pipe.  They're going to want to see that little habit trail of intestines and see what the hell goes on in there. 
[00:15:00]  And the only way they can do that is snake it in, get the snake.  I was doing an air conditioning job, and I used to do air conditioning and heating.  And it was at a doctor's office that did these pipe examinations.  And I had to change a grill in the examination room.  And I go in there, and there's this big glass tube, a glass cylinder.  And inside the fluid is the pipe that they use. 
[00:15:30]  And it's just this long, and it had joints on it.  I swear, it looked like something out of Alien.  Like when they go into the lab in the movie Alien, and there's an alien inside the glass tube.  Yeah, the specimen.  That's exactly what it looked like.  And I'm looking at it like, ah, it's just a horror.  How do you walk in there?  That's classic.  But now I hear they just shoot you up with so much, like, stuff that you're just, yeah, sure, Doc, deeper.  Yeah, that thing ain't fat enough, Doc.  Well, my family...  Take some crystal meth.  My... 
[00:16:00]  Go ahead.  Well, my family, I mean, they're all sick, man.  I mean, my brothers, they're twisted.  Like, when they get these minor procedures...  My brother had, like, some kind of crazy foot surgery where they had to split his toe and, oh, I don't know.  Some crazy surgery where I think he broke his bone and then it didn't grow back right, so they had to re-break it and cut his bone and...  How?  It was pretty involved.  But he wanted to stay awake for the whole damn thing and watch the doctor.  But is he insane?  You know, so he did.  And then my other brother, he went in for the pipe. 
[00:16:30]  Ooh.  And he wanted to watch the procedure as well.  Watch it?  Yeah.  My brothers are all about watching their medical procedures.  Oh, because they got a TV screen.  Yeah.  Did he just snake up there?  Well, my brother, you know, he was watching and then all of a sudden he was like...  He started screaming and then the doctor said exactly what you just said.  Screaming?  Oh, yeah.  He was like, more medication.  More medication for him.  Numb him up more.  Because of the pain?  Yeah.  Ow.  I'm feeling woozy.  But I've heard they use, like, you know, smaller instruments these days. 
[00:17:00]  Well, you've got to figure.  Hey, dude, it's like cell phones, man.  It's got to get smaller.  I guarantee there was a day where, you know, men had to get the pipe and it was as big as a fist.  That big old cell phone in your vehicle.  Just imagine, you know, the first cell phones you got and compare it to probably the size of the pipe they had to use.  And now we're down to smaller cell phones, thank God.  Oh, real small.  Yeah.  So you've got to think the technology on the pipe is heading the same way.  Everything is getting smaller.  I'll opt for a bigger cell phone if they use their energies to making the pipe smaller, you know? 
[00:17:30]  But that's a great point.  You think back at the old, that huge cell phone you used to have, the thing that was like a brick.  Oh, yeah.  And you'd pop the mouthpiece thing down and dial it.  It was really big.  Yeah.  A little, little clamshell phone.  Hopefully the pipe, the same thing.  I think the same thing.  It doesn't have to be so big, does it?  I think the technology is helping out the pipe as well as the cell phone industry.  I think the problem was that the camera had to be big. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  And the wires and everything.  Dude, it was probably like a camcorder on the end of a fist.  That was probably the first pipe.  Like the camcorders they used to use when they were taping America's Funniest Home Video  segments at home.  It rests on your shoulder.  Now, you know, you could get lipstick cams that fit on the visors of vehicles for doing  like taxi cab confessions and things like that.  Sure, they're really small.  They got little pinhole cameras.  Right.  You could just pop a pinhole in a wall and put it in there in dressing rooms and bathrooms 
[00:18:30]  in high schools.  But I bet you when my dad was getting the pipe, it was as big as this Starbucks cup.  Oh!  Starbucks cup!  Big lens at the end that they got to clean up with a Windex when it comes out.  Whoa!  Well, let's look in there.  A bit nasty picture.  It's just a thought because my brother said that the doctor said they're finally getting  smaller.  Yeah.  So that made me think, oh my God, there was a time that this was really bad. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Really bad.  Looked like old kinescopes from the 40s.  Your hit parade or whatever shows those were.  A little nasty, but now it's, you know, crystal clear color pictures of your colon.  Yeah.  There you have it.  Through a really tiny camera.  Well, that's kind of a positive to the whole thing if you need to get the pipe.  Right?  Your brother listens every day, right?  Brother Joe?  I think to the replay.  He's in Puerto Rico, though. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  They're gigging in Puerto Rico.  He got a gig at the Hard Rock in Puerto Rico.  Wow, that's cool.  With the U2 band.  Nice.  Yeah, his U2 band is just ridiculously good.  They're getting calls from everywhere.  The guy travels more than we do.  The guy's all over.  He was in Colorado playing ski resorts in Colorado.  Do we have his U2 demo?  I don't know.  Where are we at?  Eric ran out of the studio.  Yeah, it's really good.  Well, I ask because Brother Joe has a lot of great songs that we play on the show.  We don't have the pipe song anymore.  Ah. 
[00:20:00]  Another thing we lost when we were kicked out of our office.  We'll get it because he keeps everything, so I'm sure he's got another copy.  Incidentally, there are pills you can swallow for that stuff with cameras in them now that  photograph every inch of your intestines.  Stop it.  No, I'm not kidding.  Stop it.  NASA's working on it for a little disease prevention for astronauts who are gone for  a long time.  A little pill with a camera in it.  And they photograph every inch.  It sends it to a computer through your colon and your intestines and then you evacuate  it.  That's interesting.  And then the last picture you see is Norton's smiling face. 
[00:20:30]  Camera resting on his chest.  And a little turd tripod.  Wow, science.  That is fantastic.  Hey, let's continue the duty talk.  Well, maybe not because today's problem is the mouse will not answer the...  Hello!  Don't want to bitch anybody.  No. 
[00:21:00]  God forbid we bitch, but the mouse does not answer the phones today.  Oh, it isn't?  Well, thank God we have the backup buttons.  That's today's problem.  Are you on that mouse thing?  You know, you got your buttons underneath?  Let's try it.  Yeah, I can't hear you guys.  But anyway, hey, look.  You guys better be glad you're not parents because when my boy was three years old I  had to bend him over in half and pull a three inch wide log and about seven inches long  out of his ass.  Yeah, that's all I was doing in Neverland.  They were literally regular from their cancer medication. 
[00:21:30]  I got to tell you, you know, we were listening to some more Michael Jackson audio in the office  before the show today.  Who could get enough of that?  With that dude.  What's his name, man?  Which one?  The guy that starred it all.  The documentary film maker.  Best year.  Who?  Best year.  Yeah.  I guess, what, he's got a new version or something that's out there?  Steve's going through the audio right now?  Yep.  And I was talking to Anthony about this whole thing, man.  At first, I really believed that he was completely innocent, Michael Jackson.  I really did.  You did? 
[00:22:00]  I just thought that he just lives on another plane, man.  Another planet.  You know, he was just so famous and had so many people around him and had such a weird  life growing up.  It was just his way of maybe having a childhood.  You know, you've heard that theory by now, right?  Yeah.  But now all these allegations are coming out and stuff.  And everything here is creepy.  It's the Jesus juice.  It's, wow, Macaulay Culkin, he saw Home Alone and thought Macaulay Culkin was an interesting  actor.  Interesting actor. 
[00:22:30]  Well, whatever he said, I want to meet this kid and brought him to Neverland and Corey  Feldman.  But I was telling Anthony, they don't have that Mac Daddy of evidence.  That one thing that's going to make everyone go, holy, holy mother of God, this guy is  so guilty.  Yeah.  It's all like weird things, but they don't have that one thing where, you know, a boy  is going to come forward and say, no, he did me.  Well, they do.  They do have that.  They have some pretty damning testimony from a couple of children that said that there 
[00:23:00]  was mutual masturbation.  There was oral sex.  He performed oral sex on the kids.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  But the credibility factor.  Well, the one family, the credibility is a little strange.  Right, right.  Because so much money was given to them.  It doesn't mean it didn't happen.  I understand that.  But when you're going through the court system, that's a biggie.  Yeah.  The credibility.  The people with, you know, bad credibility, you know, they're not respected.  Well, that's the defense's job in this case is going to be to discredit every witness 
[00:23:30]  that comes forward and make people like you, you know, make the jury think like you're  thinking.  Like, oh, even though there is evidence out there, make them think there's no evidence.  This is all circumstantial.  There's no real home run piece of evidence here.  But meanwhile, everything added together is the home run, you know?  Yeah.  Because rarely, it's rare that you do get that one piece of evidence, that TV show evidence  where you come bursting through the courtroom doors and, oh, here you go, your honor. 
[00:24:00]  And, oh, well, he's guilty, you know.  And the guy gets up on the stand.  He's up on the stand.  And because he sees the evidence, he has to confess in front of everybody.  All right.  I did it.  I'm glad about it.  You know, it never happens that way.  Are you talking about Columbo?  Columbo is the best.  Recipe for murder.  Murder.  I just saw the Columbo episode just a couple of days ago with Johnny Cash.  That's a good one.  Oh, I love that one.  Where is the pilot?  I remember that one.  He's flying to a gig from another gig.  And he wants to kill, I guess, his wife and some other woman. 
[00:24:30]  So he drugs them and then jumps out of the plane with a parachute, like this homemade parachute,  in his navigation chart bag, and hits the ground, breaks his leg.  The plane crashes, kills the two people.  And then he goes about his business like it was just a plane crash.  Oops.  You know, what are you going to do?  But Columbo finds out that he was a parachute loader in the army and he made a parachute  out of this material and the whole thing. 
[00:25:00]  But the big gag was they couldn't find the parachute that he used.  So Columbo sets up Johnny Cash and makes a phone call in front of Johnny Cash saying,  well, we're going to have to look for the thermos that was in the plane because that contained  the drugs that the two women were drugged with.  So we'll send out a bunch of people to search.  We're going to search the grounds of the plane crash and try to find this thermos.  Meanwhile, Johnny Cash hid the parachute in those woods.  He was afraid they were going to find the parachute and then the jigs up.  So he goes to find the parachute and Columbo's waiting for him. 
[00:25:30]  He's just sitting there waiting.  How did Columbo know?  Columbo knew.  He's sitting there.  He always knew, man.  So as Johnny Cash is walking back to his car holding the parachute,  Columbo's by his car and turns the headlights on and there's Johnny Cash in the headlights  holding the evidence.  Everything's like right there.  Crystal clear.  I gotcha.  Yeah.  I gotcha.  Dead to right.  And then there's no handcuffs ever involved.  Columbo then gets into Johnny Cash's car.  Right. 
[00:26:00]  Opens the passenger door.  Johnny Cash sits down.  Turns on the radio.  Johnny Cash's song is playing.  And he's like, you know, I think somebody that makes music like this can't be all that  bad.  And he drives him to jail.  It's wonderful.  That's how it should work.  That's how everything works.  No one ever tries to run from Columbo.  Hey, get back here.  You never see him running through the woods or anything.  I watch cops.  They're all running.  No one ever runs from Columbo.  Never.  Columbo could have the flimsiest piece of evidence, too.  And the people are just like, you know, all right, Lieutenant, you've got me. 
[00:26:30]  I did kill her, but I had to.  Yeah.  All right.  You found what?  A cigarette butt in an ashtray that wasn't the brand that he smoked, like the flimsiest piece  of evidence.  And you never see Columbo yanking out a plunger and attacking a Haitian.  Sinking it deep, yeah.  All right.  Wonderful.  The phones have exploded.  Oh, now they're working.  Thank you.  Tom, what's going on?  He doesn't mean it's a lot of calls.  They literally exploded and we needed them fixed immediately.  Yeah.  Washington, our phones exploded.  Hey, Tom. 
[00:27:00]  Hey.  Morning, fellas.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Oh, I want to let you know that you don't need a doctor for your problem.  A couple of squats on the anal destroyer will take care of your problem right away.  Yeah.  The anal destroyer.  Punch down.  The good old anal destroyer.  Anal destroyer.  Rears its ugly head again.  They sure give them interesting names.  Ben in Boston, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Gag, gag, gag.  Aren't you supposed to be producing the show?  That old gag.  Who, me?  Who, me?  Yeah.  What do you got there, sir? 
[00:27:30]  You mean me?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Ben.  I used to be a drug rep and I used to sell the stuff that you had to take to clean you  out so they could go in and get a nice look-see.  Yeah.  And one of the docs, you know, was complaining that this stuff didn't work.  So he's like, oh, come on in and watch this procedure.  So, you know, I'm wearing a wool suit.  I'm sitting there in a hot procedure room.  There's a big fat cow on the table.  The doctor's sliding this six-foot-long thing, you know, up the track.  And the woman was pretty whacked out on meds. 
[00:28:00]  All of a sudden, she stands up on the table with the scope in her.  Uh-oh.  Starts screaming like an elephant.  Here we go.  I'm teetering in the back of the room.  Next thing you know, I'm down on the ground, out cold.  And I can, in the distance, hear this woman screaming like an elephant.  It was awful.  No, I guess not.  Why were you out cold?  Oh, just, you know, the heat.  We're all waiting for it.  What was going on.  It was just nasty.  The problem with those soaps is they don't just have a camera in there. 
[00:28:30]  They've got, like, a vacuum.  And you can slide stuff down there to remove polyps.  Yeah, it's a whole thing.  And they've got some kind of metal cloth so they can grab things.  It's like Ralph Crandon's handy kitchen helper.  It's got everything on there.  Do they drug you for that?  Like, are you out or are you just like...  Valium.  They give you, like, liquid Valium, intravenous.  Oh, yeah.  And you are like...  You're not even allowed to leave the hospital by yourself anymore. 
[00:29:00]  When they give you a test like that?  Yeah, I had to pick up my brother.  Yeah, the pipe now, you know, they give you all kinds of drugs.  I had to pick them up.  It does.  And watch them for, like, three hours.  They have all kinds of other things in there, too, so you can make it turn corners and stuff.  It's, like, got joints on it.  I'm telling you, go to Natural Alternatives and get the colonics, man.  They work.  Yeah, but if something's in there that's, like, you know, a tumor...  Oh, I mean, you've got to go to a doctor, too, but I'm saying, you know...  Then, you know...  All right, let's go to, you know...  Let's go to a gym in Massachusetts. 
[00:29:30]  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Obi, I had to...  I just want to tell you, don't go on to anything like Web ID and look it up, because it'll just drive you mad.  Go to the doc and check it out.  I actually had to go for...  They had to check my prostate, but they had to go on the inside to check it.  So I got this transrectal ultrasound where they stick this pipe up your ass and move it all around.  I'm listening.  All right.  I can barely hear you guys. 
[00:30:00]  Sorry.  All right.  And it's the worst, because she's like, okay, you need to relax.  I'm like, you've got something up my ass.  I can't relax here.  It's a hard, relaxing time.  You've got something up your ass.  Yeah, definitely not.  But don't try to investigate this stuff yourself on the web.  Just go to the doctor, because you'll drive yourself crazy.  And, hey, I'm punching out.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike the Trucker.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, little Jimmy.  Hey, fella.  Hey, you ever going to get your way up to Minnesota to do a show?  Eventually, I'll get out there. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, sure.  We haven't been on there that long, but...  Minnesota?  Yeah.  I'd like to get out there.  Any comedy clubs in Minnesota?  Minneapolis is actually a good comedy city.  Oh, okay.  Maybe around September or something.  I never think about Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Sure.  You know, I never think there are cities there.  I just see plains and snow.  Hey, yo.  Isn't that where WKHT is?  Oh, is it?  I don't know.  Where is Mary?  Tell him where it's shot.  Oh, Minneapolis.  Very good.  I don't know if KHT is.  Yeah.  Yo, what's up?  Yeah, go ahead.  I had to tell Eric something.  Yeah, when you go to the doctor, he's going to probably send you right to the gastro-ontologist 
[00:31:00]  and ask them, instead of doing the old tube up the wazoo, have them do the virtual colonoscopy.  It's almost like an x-ray, but they probably won't because they'll say, oh, you get a better  look when you do the virtual thing.  I get them once a year, and boy, that sucks.  All right.  Thank you.  And there's one other thing that, what's worse is that is when you've got kidney stones,  and they put a stent in, and they take this long lighted scope off your dick and start 
[00:31:30]  slowly pulling it out.  Ah, stop.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to throw up.  They won't put you under either.  They'll shoot an hurricane in the tip of your dick.  Ow.  Ow.  And then there's a long scope about maybe three feet long.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It goes up there.  Shut up.  Take a deep breath.  Stop it.  All of a sudden, he pulls it in and whoop, grips it right out into the spencer bottom.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck. 
[00:32:00]  You're all right.  Ow.  Ow.  Quiet.  All right, you know.  Oh.  I was ready to move on, but we have to go to Scott in Jersey because he got the scope  with no meds 20 years ago.  What does that look like?  Oh.  Hey, Scott.  Hello.  Exactly.  Listen.  20 years ago, no meds?  Absolutely, man.  I've never forgotten about it.  It was the worst prison checks I ever had.  It must have been like a telescope from a submarine. 
[00:32:30]  Dude, that was 84.  It's not like it was 1968.  84 is pretty...  Yeah, they've come leaps and bounds.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Dude, dude.  Miniaturization.  Let's go back to our theory.  Think about what kind of phones we were using in 84.  84.  No, I mean the meds.  No meds.  Why no meds for that?  Yeah, I know.  They probably figured it ain't gonna do any difference.  It ain't gonna make a difference if we give him meds or not.  He's gonna feel this one for a week.  Oh.  Oh, they hadn't figured out it's better to make it round.  It was probably square.  You know, if we make that round, it'd probably fit a little easier. 
[00:33:00]  Those corners wouldn't scrape so much.  Oh, round!  The round one came out in 85.  It should be flexible because the original was just straight and you had to force it.  It's like a fence post.  Yeah, sometimes when you look at, you know, old technology and now, you know, having the  knowledge we have today, you're like, how stupid were you guys back then?  The fence post with a Vivitar duct taped to the tip.  It was rigid.  Yeah, I can imagine.  Rigid, right? 
[00:33:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  And how did that feel?  Oh, fuck.  Are you kidding me?  Great.  First, I walked in and they had the flexible one on there.  It looked like a long three-foot boroscope.  And of course, this was in the Navy, so they didn't know what the fuck they were doing.  The doctor walked in and said, what is that to the corpsman standing there?  He said, that's the boroscope.  He said, no, get me the rigid one.  Oh.  That's good.  And then they put a leather strap in my teeth and went at it.  What the hell is that? 
[00:34:00]  17th century.  They didn't put a leather strap in your mouth, did they?  Opie, are you kidding?  I am absolutely telling you the truth.  A leather strap.  They gave him a shot of whiskey.  Tough it up, kid.  This is the Navy for Christ's sake.  That's amazing.  All right, Scott.  Thanks.  Later.  Thanks for sharing.  Yowch.  We're done.  We're done.  That's good.  Well, good luck.  As we go to break, we should play this little song.  It makes sense today.  Hey, Pat from Munaki is doing the news. 
[00:34:30]  Hey, Phil.  How are you going to do that?  Starting at 7 a.m.  He's already here?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well, Pat from Munaki is going to be the big star today on the program.  But first.  All around the toilet bowl, Big Monkey chased the weasel.  But weasel has the diapers on, goes the weasel.  Big Monkey takes the diapers off, wipes the weasel's bottom,  puts clean diapers on, and then goes the weasel. 
[00:35:00]  Poop goes down the toilet bowl, Big Monkey tells the weasel.  So weasel takes the diapers off, and weasel climbs up on the hole.  But weasel doesn't have to go.  Well, maybe weasel has to go.  Then weasel gets the feeling, and weasel knows it's time to go. 
[00:35:30]  Goes the weasel.  In the water down the hole, that is where the poop goes.  Weasel knows the feeling now.  Goes the weasel, flush the toilet down the bowl.  Goes the weasel.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem? 
[00:36:00]  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this? 
[00:36:30]  Wow, that's really nice.  What's going against the wall?  I'm not going against you.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  I think very often college acts don't give their very best shot to colleges.  I remember I played a college up in New England with the electric flag.  Bowdoin College, about 2,500 fairly conservative students, nice guys. 
[00:37:00]  Homecoming, whatever.  The deans were there.  And in the middle of the concert, Mike Bloomfield is on the guitar and goes,  Holy man!  This sound system sucks, man!  Just a minute, man.  It sucks.  You get us a new sound system, we'll wait.  Okay, man?  It says, sucks.  And the dean goes, well, we'll see what we can do about that.  One, two.  One, one, two your ass, man!  It's very nice of the flag.  I played a lot of unusual school. 
[00:37:30]  I played the Air Force Academy last spring.  And a lot of people are snotty about it.  Oh, it must have been something.  They were very nice.  They were a good audience.  They want to be like other college students.  They were very orderly.  And they were very attentive.  And I remember at the concert, it was her,  Prepare to laugh, ho!  Laugh, ho!  Prepare for Mr. Klein's next joke.  We're, we can come in this world.  Set up punchline, laugh, ho!  Together, you know.  The dumb shit you see on the news. 
[00:38:00]  Like these women newscasters that want to go into men's locker rooms.  I mean, look at what they're making an issue out of these ugly fucking dogs.  That's what they're prick fucking lookers.  That's what they do.  They look at prick.  They went to school for 10 years, so they had the license to walk into a locker room and look at prick, right?  Did you see the one that said they molested her or something?  Did you ever see anything so fucking ugly in your life? 
[00:38:30]  So she's pissed off.  She spent thousands of bucks.  Now she can't even look at prick.  Dumb prick looker, fucking bitch bastard.  There's more important things in this world than prick looking.  That's what I think!  I think!  Oh, shit!  XM202.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:39:00]  Hey, we like to call this show The O.N.A. Virus.  It's spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Getting more gooder every day.  Yeah.  Bunch of growing pains here and there, but in general, yeah, in general we're very, very happy.  Of course.  In general, right?  In general, the overall picture.  Stupid Martini Steve is coming in giving me advice on my dumps. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, Steve had all kinds of medical advice for you during the break.  He was asking me about my dumps and I go, my dumps are so hard.  How hard are they?  How hard are they?  I was telling Jimmy, you know, because Anthony does not like to hear about this stuff, but  Jimmy's like, tell me more, tell me more.  I go, Jimmy, you know when you're, you know, sometimes you take a dump and it kind of just  slithers into the bowl and you don't even hear anything?  Like an anaconda going through the water. 
[00:40:00]  Exactly!  Looking for Jennifer Lopez.  Barely hear it, but it's there.  Where's Ice Cube?  And, but mine, my duties are so hard, it's like a belly flop, man.  The splash these things make when it hits the bowl from only what?  Six inches high.  Hi.  It's like you're on a bidet.  Oh, it's ridiculous the splash I get because they're just hard as a rock.  So Steve's like, well that means you're, uh, you have too much protein. 
[00:40:30]  You're eating too much protein.  You eat a lot of egg whites, which I do.  Yeah.  And you're like, what, what is the deal?  The protein?  I was talking to my, my trainer the other day and he said that your trainer?  Yeah.  Did he put a muzzle on you and teach you to ride a bike in a circus?  Did he make you dance in Romania?  Nails my feet to the pedals so I don't get loose.  Yeah, exactly.  Do they really do that?  What?  They nail the bear's feet to the pedals.  They secure the feet to the pedals.  Dude, I was, uh, to go off on a little tangent, I was flipping around. 
[00:41:00]  I have about 300 channels now and still nothing on.  Yeah, of course.  That old gag, but it's the truth.  And they were showing what they do to those dancing bears.  Oh my, I'm not a, I'm not an animal rights activist by any means, but you see some of  these videos and it's just, it's, it's disgusting.  You know, cause the dancing bears are famous in what?  Romania, uh, Greece, I think.  Yeah, those foreign countries are known for their, you know, tenderness to animals.  Eastern Europe mostly, yeah.  And they train them in such a way, you know, to force them to stand on two, you know, on 
[00:41:30]  two, uh, on two legs or whatever.  That's why the, the best, uh, video clip ever is of that bear that was on that TV show  with that fat pig woman sitting next to the bear.  She smiles, looks over, the bear looks at her and just smacks her across the face, lays  her on the floor.  Yeah, I'm a huge fan of When Animals Attack.  That's great.  I love When Animals Attack.  Huge fan of that.  They unloaded off ogres.  I don't know if I said this on the air off the air, but the, uh, the, how they make  fur for fur.  And I'm not a rights activist either, man. 
[00:42:00]  But when they, when I watch how they kill, how they skin the animals alive for fur.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  I mean, you know, yeah, I, I love a good piece of steak and, uh, I, I like leather, uh, clothing  and stuff like that.  But, you know, there's, there's a way to off these animals a little more, um.  Absolutely.  Humane.  Humane.  Yeah, then, then ripping the skin off of him while he's alive.  Dude, it was alive, he was breathing after, he was just laying there skinless in a truck,  it was just awful.  Hmm.  All right.  So, whatever.  Go ahead, Steve.  Uh, talking to my trainer, I explained I had the exact same problem where I just was 
[00:42:30]  going two, two and a half days, no dumping whatsoever.  Ooh.  And did it start when we started this new schedule?  It's a combination of the different eating habits and the weird sleep schedule.  I'm doing about 10, 11 egg whites a day now, and it's too much protein, and I'm not doing enough fiber.  I'm not doing enough roughage, and it just binds you up completely.  Look how much weight Steve's lost.  Yes.  You can tell he's wearing a very form-fitting black shirt today.  I'm sweating my ass off. 
[00:43:00]  That's why I'm doing it.  Could it be because your stomach got tied, too?  Because his system is like a Wonka machine.  Like you throw in 50 pounds, and you hear like a plink, and a little piece comes out.  That has something to do with it, yeah.  But this is not uncommon, apparently.  That's hilarious.  Wonka machine.  Yeah, the surgery certainly didn't help the process, but having that much protein and just chicken breasts and all this stuff, 
[00:43:30]  it just, it binds you up completely, and you just get, you get constipated, and you can tell that you start,  and what happens after, it just gets toxic in your body, and you start to just feel nauseous, and you can't.  So what I've been doing now is I've been taking Metamucil tablets, six of them a day,  to try to combat the fact that I'm eating so many egg whites and so much protein.  Stop it!  Shut up!  Stop it!  All right.  You know what the most fun for me when I got my colonics was?  Because you can watch it down a little glass tube. 
[00:44:00]  I was watching little pieces of feta cheese go by.  You did not.  Oh, yes, I did.  It could only be feta cheese, that awful little white.  Why would there be a glass tube that you could then watch?  I don't know.  It's kind of like a, why not?  It's like an aquarium for your lungs.  Oh.  It's like that Tool Sober video.  That little animated pictures pushing the crap down the tube.  Hey, Mudflap, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey, um, I hope you don't worry about it.  Maybe it's just something small like a piece of marshmallow from the old days. 
[00:44:30]  All right, all right, Mudflap.  Jesus.  Jesus, Mudflap.  Help me out here.  It might be sticky.  All right, thank you, Steve.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  That's wonderful.  Martini Steve with a little bit of medical advice there.  Metamucil.  Ugh.  What the hell happened?  What happened to this goddamn show?  No more lesbians.  No more.  We're all just talking about dumps.  We used to talk about chicks, and we definitely need to bring the chick factor back onto the  show.  What's the pipe and stuff? 
[00:45:00]  What the, what the, what happened?  I like the new direction of the radio program, but we definitely need to bring back some of  the, uh, the hotness.  The debauchery.  We need a little hotness.  We need some, dare I say, stunts.  Yes.  Not crazy stunts that are, that are going to get us fired again, but some kind of stunt.  Absolutely.  You know, um, we, we're developing this new show and, uh, having a good time with it,  but, uh, you know, we gotta bring the hotness back.  We just have to. 
[00:45:30]  I got an email, by the way, from a woman, her and her husband are like a swingers.  Dude, I got the same email.  You see how hot that girl is?  Swingers.  Oh my God, is she sexy.  Really?  Yeah.  Um, that's the one that's topless on like a pool table or something?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And what, they like, uh, banging?  Well, she, she wants to do the lesbian couch.  Um, she's really attractive too.  She's, I think she's married like 20 years ago.  Do you got a, uh, a copy of that email?  Because at home I do, yes.  Sure.  At home you do.  I mean, not with me, yeah.  There's computers everywhere though.  Yeah, can you get it off?  Oh yeah, yeah, of course.  Can you get it off the computer?  Because we got this, there we go.  You got a copy of the email at home. 
[00:46:00]  Well, I'm the email.  You're right.  I'm thinking in terms of like being right here, right now.  Like, no, I don't.  No, well, uh, when we take, uh, another break, you gotta get it.  Okay, yeah, she's not.  The email is unbelievable.  Yeah.  Like the husband lets her bang whoever she wants.  Yeah, it's really hard.  They have threesomes and then she goes off and has lesbianism.  Really?  But she says she's faithful to her husband because she doesn't cuddle or kiss anybody else.  Yeah, that's, that's faithful.  That, that makes perfect sense.  That's, that's how she justifies it.  Well, he's into it though.  He's cool with it.  That's what he likes.  Yeah, that's how she justifies it.  That, you know, she, she's only in love with him, but, uh, she's allowed to do all this other 
[00:46:30]  of stuff and she wants to come in here and get completely crazy with us that's fantastic that  is really odd we got to cover those cameras i know it's a human resources violation if i jack  off in studio there's no probably as probably would be resources uh frowns on that as i heard  yes well pat from monarchy's here and he's going to be doing the course he is he's still going  through uh security even though he's been here about 10 times he shows up so early anytime he's  here uh he's got to come to the studio he shows up so goddamn early and he was here yesterday he 
[00:47:00]  does deliveries you know he runs that delivery company or whatever and uh he he always seems  to have deliveries right around the building because you leave here in the in the morning  when we're done with the show and there he is in his little van waving hey how you doing you know  we love our fans but it's kind of embarrassing sometimes because he has this van that is just  covered with wow yeah and it's just parked right in front of where we broadcast and we walk out and  there he's like hey just happened to be in the neighborhood driving around a little delivery

[00:50:00]  clip oh it's five there we go and i used to write things up on the top here oh well we'll figure it  out you guys the latest on michael jackson uh-huh it's in uh it's on page six of the post circles of  evidence on jacko the most lurid testimony to be heard in michael jackson's looming child molestation  trial could concern the bizarre appearance of his penis yes i heard this on fox news they they actually 
[00:50:30]  gave a disclaimer uh please parents use discretion if there's children in the room oh can we get the  audio of them uh doing the story because people expect us to to talk about it but to hear this on  tv oh it was on fox news and they were like you know this is very graphic and uh please if you have  any children yes send them out of the room private investigator ernie rizzo and that's funny he's a  private investigator and he's talking about michael jackson's privates who was hired by the family of 
[00:51:00]  the boy who accused jackson of molestation in 1993 predicts that jackson's latest alleged victim could  provide a damning uh damning testimony about the pop oddballs uniquely marked manhood rizzo former  chicago police detective who has seen photographs of jackson's genitals taken by cops in 1993 claims that  because jackson bleaches his body twice a week distinctive markings on his penis are visible  when he is aroused distinctive markings you ready for this it looks like a barber's pole a barber's 
[00:51:30]  pole it's got rings yeah uh that's exactly what it looks like the first kid and all the other kids  who have seen his penis know that there are brown circles around it oh by the way why wouldn't you want  your kids to hear that description so they know what to look out for it's like when there's a burglar  in the neighborhood yeah don't let that thing come near you just sketch of it if you see this run for  help wow he's got brown rings around it yeah and what caused that uh let's see jackson doesn't have 
[00:52:00]  uh uh what's that the thing vitiligo vitiligo thank you debbie roe uh got him the bleach because she  used to work for the uh dermatologist so he bleaches his whole body yeah and then when you  know he wants to be white and people started noticing that then he said he had that disease  that self-hating psychopath you can't blame him for that being white is pretty cool it's fun  uh thin nose thin lips okay so that just kill himself that's the latest that everyone's talking 
[00:52:30]  about about the jackson thing now he would get in this tub is what fox was fox news was saying he'd get  in the tub with this body bleaching stuff and lay down in it now i'm thinking the rings might be  from you ever get in the bathtub and uh your junk kind of floats and kind of peers its ugly periscope  up so if you don't get the level of the water the exact same every time it's probably going to bleach 
[00:53:00]  different levels of your schlong uh different intensities so like you know you ever go to the  beach and you see seaweed washed up in lines on the on the beach from the way the tide came up  not exactly the same every time and you know stuff like that you've got those rings around it  ring around the penis now here's um a description they served a search warrant on me which allowed  them to view and photograph my body including my penis your front private parts your back private 
[00:53:30]  parts your side private parts it was the most humiliating ordeal of my life the most telling  mark occurred when michael jackson actually lifted his penis as if in a an aroused state when things  get aroused you see the other side and those are the descriptions that he gave i ask all of you to  wait and hear the truth before you label or condemn me don't treat me like a criminal because i am  innocent according to the lead investigator the boy's description matched 
[00:54:00]  we cooperated what the boy has said and we were able to cooperate that through the photograph of  mr jackson oh i wanted to rouse the underside you can see some distinctive marks see the rings  oh oh have some jesus juice and kiss the rings guess how old it is i was gonna say maybe this is a ring  for each kid that he uh maybe that's where the rings came from right oh that's tight that's 
[00:54:30]  leaving a mark he's almost like a tree you can tell how old the kid is that he's raping by how  many rings there are on it sexual sociopath count the rings bleaching himself and then raping  children what a lovely human being oh he's sticking up for him america what a freakazoid well  we'll we'll see what happens shane from jersey hey what's happening fellas what's up shane  uh not so much i think those rings around the old hog are from my nicer crystal meth abuse uh 
[00:55:00]  earlier  it's not fair that the listeners could get out of a really bad joke or line by doing a pat from  menaki impression you should be able to just sit there and and feel really uncomfortable suck it  up you should be yeah you should suck it up yep all right we should take another break and i guess  then uh pat from menaki will start uh giving us some news for today let's uh try him out are you

[00:58:30]  Lucky you, the improv, February 24th through 26th only.  That's right, Houston, the improv, February 24th, 26th.  Box office, 713-333-8800.  713-333-8800.  For more information, check out Jim's website at eatabullet.com. 
[00:59:00]  I'm very good at cutting the radio spots.  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  I'm Chuck Devine, and there's deep powder skiing for President's Weekend in the western United States from the Rockies all the way to California.  We'll start out at Breckenridge.  They got another 10 inches of brand-new snow.  That's 20 inches over the past couple of days.  So you will have knee-deep and waist-deep snow and fresh tracks, too, for them and for Aspen.  The Canyons and Deer Valley in Utah, well over a foot and a half of snow over the past few days. 
[00:59:30]  So they're in great shape, too.  Timberline, Oregon, is skiing from six different lifts, so things have improved there.  Squaw Valley, California got snow every day this week.  That's over 300 inches for the whole year.  Powder skiing on some trails and extensive grooming on others.  Snowshoe Mountain West Virginia with more than 50 well-groomed trails of loose and frozen granulars.  Seven Springs, Pennsylvania is 100%.  Sunday River, Maine with three feet of snow the past week and 48 miles of pack powder on eight mountains. 
[01:00:00]  I'm Chuck Devine with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  XM news, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  Ian Anthony here, XM 202.  XM 202. 
[01:00:30]  You guys want to get Pat from Menachia in here?  Yeah, in a little bit, a couple minutes.  Someone on Instant Feedback pointed out that my description of what happened to Michael Jackson's penis  is pretty much him tie-dying his schlong.  It's a tie-dyed schlong.  It makes perfect sense. 
[01:01:00]  Very good.  That person is dating themselves.  You hear about the waitresses at the Bogota?  Yes, I agree with the Bogota.  Is that the AC?  It's a huge story today, man.  I don't know where this one's going to go, but I think it's hilarious.  It's not the only huge story from the Bogota.  Oh, no.  The fact that I'm going to be there in Atlantic City April 26th, irrelevant.  Tickets don't go on sale on February 26th.  April 16th, I think. 
[01:01:30]  Just go to eatabullet.com.  Just go to eatabullet.com if you're a Jim Norton fan.  You're going to want to go after you read this article.  Yeah, basically, they got the hot cocktail waitresses, and starting Monday, all 217  Bogota babes, cocktail waitresses at the Bogota Hotel, Casino, and Spa will be weighed.  They're going to be weighed.  They're going to be weighed Monday.  Yep.  And then if their weight increases by 7% from that baseline, they will be ordered to lose  the extra pounds in a gym paid for by the hotel. 
[01:02:00]  There you go.  If they fail to lose the weight, they'll be fired.  You're fired.  This makes perfect sense.  I saw it on the news this morning, and some people are a little angry.  Real fast.  Employees will be periodically re-weighed to ensure compliance.  You know they're going to re-weigh.  It's like a drug testing.  Yeah.  You know they're going to re-weigh the ones that they look, because you know the guys  that are in charge over there, they're going to see the girls and go, hey, she's looking  a little thick.  What do you think? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, pull her in for a re-weigh.  You know, it's not going to be like just randomly re-weigh them.  They're going to look and see.  Yeah, she seems to be putting on a couple.  Why don't you pull her in?  That's classic.  It is.  That's what these girls are there for, though.  They're dressed the shortest skirts ever.  I mean, really.  You could just about see hair coming out of the bottom of those skirts.  I like what they wear down there.  They've been showing video all morning.  It's pretty nice.  Mm-hmm.  So, it's got to be humiliating, though.  But this is what they do.  Hey, toots. 
[01:03:00]  Hey, toots.  Get on the scale.  Yeah.  Put your stems up on this scale over here, toots.  You think she gets a chance to, like, take a dump or something beforehand?  Beforehand?  Before the weigh-in.  She's sweating all night long like a wrestler?  Yeah, I was going to say, like high school wrestlers.  Yeah, high school wrestling, trying to make weight.  Have you been eating a lot?  No, no, no.  Just egg whites.  I can't go to the bathroom.  I'm all backed up.  Kicker in the stomach.  It's water weight.  I'm having my period.  I don't know. 
[01:03:30]  It makes perfect sense, though.  Yep.  This is one of those jobs where you can't have a girl that's fat.  And you know something?  They're all very attractive.  They're all, you know, they're hired for their bodies and stuff.  But then if they work in there and they gain weight and you try to fire them, they turn around and sue you.  You go, why?  I'm being fired for what?  Because you're fat.  Well, that's some kind of discrimination.  No, it's your job description.  Just like somebody that works on a computer needs computer skills.  Someone walking around half naked serving drinks, their purpose is to, you know, be attractive. 
[01:04:00]  Walk around with your titties hanging out and your nice legs showing on that short skirt, under the short skirt.  So if they gain some weight, they're not doing their job.  Well, this is what's going to happen.  There's 217 Borgata babes.  One will sue.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  At least one will sue.  Of course.  And they said you have to take into account medical conditions like pregnancy and diabetes.  That's what you want serving your drinks when you're losing 40 grand.  Some fat diabetic who can't drop a few. 
[01:04:30]  A toe falls on the table.  You win.  He was banging cocktail wings.  It's two at a time.  Yeah, her toe falls on red.  Yeah, it falls on the roulette wheel.  On the roulette wheel.  Hey, I won.  A little chitter of the nail as it goes around.  Chitter.  Well, why would her foot be up that high?  High.  You know, so the joke was high-picking.  And that's true.  She'd probably scream and you'd know it was a toe.  Right.  You'd probably go, that's not the thing.  That's a toe.  If a toe fell into the roulette wheel, I think the croupier would know that it was a toe and not the ball. 
[01:05:00]  I hate when our jokes aren't accurate.  Yeah.  And it would probably fall into her shoe.  Yeah, it wouldn't get up on the table.  Good point.  Because she's wearing stockings.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That joke stumps.  And if it was ready to fall off, she probably wouldn't be working.  She'd be at a doctor.  Yeah.  For God's sake.  You wouldn't just work until it falls off.  That's silly.  They don't fall off, actually.  They're technically amputated, so there'd be no way to perform surgery in the casino without people noticing.  Right.  And it wouldn't be clean.  Boy, that joke really went nowhere now that you really think about it. 
[01:05:30]  You break it down, yeah.  You break it down.  I like going inside the joke every once in a while on the show.  Inside the joke.  At first, there was a few people out there laughing and chuckling a little bit.  Beyond the joke.  Beyond the joke.  Beyond the joke.  We need a little, you know, into that image of the toe flipping around in the roulette wheel.  Eric, write that down.  Steve has to make a little sound bite that goes, beyond the humor or beyond the joke.  Yes.  Yes, it is, Eric.  So that's one of the big stories today.  It's a slow news day, actually.  There's not much going on, except that spring training's about to begin, and they're revving 
[01:06:00]  up the Red Sox-Yankee feud.  Oh, yeah.  Our front page on the New York Post today says, Rat Sox.  Ho, ho.  And it's Wells.  He's a Red Sox now.  Of course, a beloved Yankee pitcher.  And he's bitching about stuff.  What is he saying?  Torrey dissed me?  Yeah.  And A-Rod's all talk?  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  A-Rod's all talk.  You see the numbers that guy puts up?  Hmm.  You know, I'm a Mets fan, but you've got to give him credit.  The guy gets the job done.  The Mets are selling record amounts of tickets for the season, also.  They had a great off-season.  Yeah.  It looks like they could be a good team this year.  I was looking into season tickets for the Mets.  Are you insane?  I don't know.  That's really going to mess up your schedule.  I live pretty close to Shea.  You should get one of those packages where you go to, like, I don't know, 20 games.  Yeah.  10 games.  That's what I'm thinking. 
[01:07:00]  I'm not going to, like, you know, get every game.  You're a Yankee fan.  I know, but I enjoy going to the games.  His chick likes the Mets.  And my girlfriend's a Mets fan.  Oh, all right.  That makes sense.  But I do like the Mets, too.  I'm not, you know, a Yankee fan and hate the Mets.  You know, there are some people that have to hate the Mets if you're a Yankee fan, which  is ridiculous.  But I like it.  It's like watching the kids play when you go to the Mets game if you're a Yankee fan.  All right.  Let's relax.  It's cute.  Let's calm down a little bit.  Oh, look at that.  He hit a double.  All right.  In other news today, Bill Cosby won't face charges. 
[01:07:30]  I told you.  They don't have enough evidence, or I don't even know why.  Where are they going to get evidence from?  This story is 20 years old.  How old is it?  Older than 20 years?  I don't even know.  Well, he's got stories all over the ball field, but the latest one was, I think, relatively  recent in Philly, right?  The story about the woman that was drugged?  Yeah.  Well, the audio we had, that was an old...  At the restaurant?  Yeah, that was an old claim.  Yeah, that was an old claim.  But this new one, also, they're not situations where there's really any evidence. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, well...  So the cause gets off the hook.  And he's just one of those guys that unless you have a ton of evidence, you're not going  to ruin his credibility, you know?  He's got that, you know, Huxtable credibility, where people still look at him as, you know,  Dr. Huxtable.  It's hard to rip that down.  Ooh, there it is.  Darkest.  Oh, look.  Bill Cosby's doing that wacky dance at the beginning of the show.  Oh, look, it's so zany.  I'm laughing just watching him do the little dance. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Where he kind of dances into Theo's room and puts his finger in Theo's girlfriend's pants  while she's dozed off.  Theo, give your girl some of these drugs and leave her laying here on the bed and I'll  give her a full examination.  She looks like she needs a pelvic and I'm Dr. Huxtable, OBGYN.  Let me just put my hand in here.  A flimflat.  A flimflat, a flar, and a flar, and a flar. 
[01:09:00]  It's the flar, and a flar, and a flar.  Let's see what I pull out over here.  What a douche Cosby is.  Doesn't like comics you use dirty words.  No.  I guess it's nice if you don't use profanity while you're fingering a sleeping person.  Self-righteous jizzbucket.  His comedy is sick.  You know, though, his comedy is brilliant.  I listened to one of the channels on XM.  They do the old school comedy.  Old school.  And I once listened on one of my trips around America when we weren't working to like a 
[01:09:30]  40-minute bit on skiing.  40 minutes, though, of Bill Cosby?  It was.  Going on and on.  Maybe that's an exaggeration, but it was at least 20 to 30 minutes.  It went on and on and on.  And you know what?  It was brilliant.  It was great.  He's a great comic.  I've got to tell you.  It was brilliant.  I love the storytelling comics.  I'm a big fan of that.  Richard Pryor did it that way.  Bill Cosby did that.  Pryor told real stories, though.  I mean, Pryor told stories that had social relevance.  Cosby, who was a great comedian and brilliantly funny, but it's like, ugh.  Then you see his real personality.  There's no connection between the two. 
[01:10:00]  No, I understand that.  It annoys me.  I'd disconnect in that way, you know?  I mean, he believes everyone should do comedy like he does, and that's the problem I have  with Cosby.  If you want to speak, speak through your work.  I hate when artists just take the fame they have and then use it to go in a totally different  direction.  Speak through your work, man.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what Pryor did.  He talked through his work.  You didn't hear him off stage.  He said what he had to say in the context of his work.  Hey, Eric found the skiing bit.  We could take a 25-minute break.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:10:30]  I'm kidding.  Don't worry about it.  You found it?  Yeah, we finally figured out how to use the master computer here in the studio.  Can we hear a minute of it?  Master computer.  You want to hear just a slight...  Just to hear it.  All right.  There's a lot of funny voice inflection.  Yeah, no, but I mean...  I went to the skiing.  We take the lift up the mountain.  That's why it takes 25 minutes.  It could be like done in three minutes.  A friend of mine who has been divorced three times. 
[01:11:00]  So, this friend of mine, who at the time, I was in my 40s.  He was 57.  So, he says, I want you to go skiing with me.  So, I said, really, I don't want to go skiing.  He said, look, you have not witnessed the feeling of going downhill with the wind in your face. 
[01:11:30]  Where's the funny?  And the sound and the freedom of going down at this speed, and it's just you and God.  All right, look.  I can understand if you're traveling across the country and have five weeks.  I understand.  We're going to see how long it takes to get to the first laugh.  To get to the first funny.  We have a timer on it and everything.  That's all we'll do.  How many seconds in is it?  We're already almost a minute in and still not one laugh yet. 
[01:12:00]  Well, he's setting up the bit.  The God, and he started to rhapsodize.  That's not a laugh.  And I kept looking at him, and I kept saying, wonderful for you, but I don't want to.  Well, he's one of these people, you know, they keep it up, and they keep it up, and they keep it up.  But he kept it up, and finally, I said, okay, I'll go with you.  I'll go with you on a Saturday. 
[01:12:30]  We're still waiting.  Oh, my God.  Oh, hey.  So he comes up, and he says, I'll take you over to the store to buy.  Okay.  He didn't use any drugs on these women.  He just lulled them to sleep with this bit and then molested them.  All right.  How long in so far?  We're 90 seconds in.  90 seconds.  A minute and a half in.  Not one laugh.  Not one joke.  You listen to this on a cross-country flight?  What were you put on when you took off out of Newark and over Colorado? 
[01:13:00]  No, no, no, no.  It gets amusing?  Dude, I drove all over the country.  Same joke.  Colorado, it got amusing, and he was driving.  Yeah.  Wow.  It shows you how bored I was in our hiatus.  So we're 90 seconds in so far.  The stuff.  So I said, okay.  He's getting ski stuff.  So we go over to this place, all these salespeople walking around with tan, wrinkled skin, but white circles. 
[01:13:30]  How long was that?  Is that the first laugh?  The tan sink in, yeah.  That was a good laugh.  That was a nice laugh.  It was a good laugh in the whole crowd.  All right.  So that was about almost two minutes in.  Okay.  A minute 45, maybe?  Something like that.  Just about two minutes in.  Almost two minutes in.  So why they laugh?  Because skiers get a lot of sunburns.  A lot of sun.  It wasn't really a joke.  It was kind of a...  Well, let's go for the...  Looked like...  The people are looking for something to laugh at.  Negatives of a raccoon, you know. 
[01:14:00]  That's the joke.  That's the joke.  Looks like a negative of a raccoon.  They all have great white teeth.  Great healthy looking teeth.  All right.  Well, there you go.  You know, teeth are funny.  I went to a dentist.  I believe his name was Bob.  Bob the dentist.  And I sat in the chair and there was an instrument there that I believe was made by the Acme Dentist.  The building is located in Virginia.  I believe Virginia. 
[01:14:30]  That's on the east coast of the United States of America, which is a great country with 50 states.  But years ago, there weren't 50 states.  Shut up!  Oh, my God!  Well, that's why he got cleared, I guess.  He's still explaining what happened.  You know, he was probably explaining and the people just went, screw it.  Drop the case.  You know what?  It's not worth our time.  I was with the girl and gave her some pills. 
[01:15:00]  I believe they were from the Pfizer Corporation.  You know, Pfizer's financials were very good this year.  And I believe the stock is going to go up for Pfizer.  But, you know, it's sort of speculation.  Like many stocks, that's why I put it in the bonds.  I like Bond.  I like James Bond movies.  You ever notice James Bond always has a nice car when he drives and he's got the ejector seat? 
[01:15:30]  Don't you wish you had an ejector seat?  Especially if I'm sitting next to you telling a goddamn story.  You can just pop me out the roof.  You want a pudding pop?  James Jell-O pudding, you know.  The Jell-O company was founded in 1927.  And I'll...  Shut up!  Yeah, they're probably like...  Drop the Kings!  All right, forget it.  Forget it.  Screw it.  I don't care if you're a serial rapist.  Right.  Leave.  And Cosby's a great comic. 
[01:16:00]  I mean, no one's saying he's not a great comedian.  I am.  In the 60s, I mean, Pryor used to steal Cosby's stuff when he first started.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he wanted to be like the next black guy with the conked hair type thing.  But...  The cause from Munaki.  Jesus.  But he just annoys me because he's so self-righteous.  So inconsistent.  All right, should we get Pat in here to do some news?  Let's do that.  Why not?  All right.  It couldn't take him any longer to get a laugh in that bit.  We're kind of doing a new segment here. 
[01:16:30]  So, ladies and gentlemen, he's one of our new faves for the new Opie and Anthony program.  What are you going to do?  What is Patty doing out there?  A lot of our listeners stress because we lost a lot of the old gang.  And Anthony and I were excited because we knew we'd find the new gang.  Of course.  And here he is.  Hey, Pat, how you doing?  Pat from Munaki.  Well, hey, why don't you give him the microphone?  Feeling very important.  He's putting on the headphones.  He's got a microphone in front of him.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, guys. 
[01:17:00]  How's it going?  Good, good.  How you been?  Oh, wonderful.  Still got all your digits and toes and everything?  So far.  Most of them.  All right.  And what kind of...  You're doing the news, of course.  Washington...  Yeah, I thought I'd put my toe in the water.  Oh, ow.  Oh, where am I?  Well, of course, Washington decided it would be a good thing for the Opie and Anthony show  to, I don't know, be a little more traditional.  I don't know, have a news person. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Someone to come in and give us the headlines.  We can comment on them.  Yeah.  We've been auditioning people.  Some good, some bad.  And Pat from Munaki thought he could come in and give it a shot.  Speaking of bad.  And give it a shot.  How have you prepared for this?  Well, I've been online.  I've had some reading materials.  He's got a book.  It's the Complete...  Wait a minute.  Complete Idiot's Guide.  The Complete Idiot's Guide to Comedy Writing.  Wow, you're brushing up. 
[01:18:00]  Yes, thank you.  That's pretty good.  And the internet...  I don't really need to.  I'm bald.  Oh, God.  Oh, oh.  That hurt.  Can I see this book?  By the way.  Yeah.  Just in case you're wondering, we're never going to find a news person.  Of course not.  Relax, people.  My friend wrote this book.  Especially not today.  Who is it?  Jim Mandrinos.  Oh, really?  James Mandrinos in the book.  Wow.  I guess he's making some money.  Yeah.  And what did you take from the book? 
[01:18:30]  Did you get anything?  I haven't got a chance to read it yet.  You haven't read it yet?  I plan on reading it, though.  So he brought it in.  Obviously, he hasn't read it.  Yeah, yeah.  I like the security out front.  But Poe's got a glass bulletproof partition there.  Yeah.  But you guys got to walk past me to go walk to the bathroom.  That doesn't seem real safe.  Oh!  It's a little icy today.  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:00]  It's a little icy.  It's a little icy.  And fog's rolling in.  I like comedy guides to the complete idiot.  I suck more than a black hole.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  Hoo-hoo.  Oh, my God.  You're awful.  That's pretty funny, actually.  I like that one.  Derek, you got the teletype in there?  All right.  As soon as Derek starts to teletype, Pat, I guess we can start with the news. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, B.  Now the news with Pat from Munaki.  I thought I'd start out with some hard news.  See those new Cialis commercials?  Where's my crash?  No, you're doing the news, my friend.  Uh-oh.  I'm not even going to let you get out of it.  But he was starting with hard news.  Hard news, right.  From Cialis.  I get it.  CBS will honor Dan Rather's 43-year career, March 9th, 8 p.m.  Rather, a reporter remembers. 
[01:20:00]  That will be the date of his last news broadcast.  Guess that starts the era of Pat from Munaki.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh, uh, uh.  Oh, God.  Well, we're more than halfway through Black History Month.  Uh-oh.  Our next story, Tim Robbins won the Hasty Pudding Award.  That's when they tell you to your face you suck.  Ha, ha, ha.  Reviewers to Keanu Reeves. 
[01:20:30]  Go to hell.  Oh, God.  Constantine.  Constantine, his new movie, opens today.  Uh, Michael Jackson.  Uh, the kid's going on stand.  Won't be able to, uh, identify him.  Because he's had so much plastic surgery.  Uh, uh.  Or not.  Yeah, his, uh, defense team's calling a lot of character witnesses.  I hear, uh, now they're going to call Bubbles the Chimp. 
[01:21:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  But he can't recognize me either.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh, uh.  Oh, my God.  Ooh, highlight.  Yeah, I need to get a highlighter myself.  Uh, CNN.  Prosecutors in Pennsylvania said Thursday they plan to, they plan no criminal charges against Bill Cosby after ending their investment.  Didn't you guys just do that story?  That's all right.  Keep going.  Pudding, pudding pops.  No.  Pudding pops, Robin.  Uh, uh, uh.  Howard Stern's eating pudding pops.  Oh, my God. 
[01:21:30]  Uh, uh.  You are bombing.  And the Enola Gay rolls down the runway.  Yeah, I could be a runway mother.  Oh, my God.  Uh.  I told him to do that, by the way.  Thank you.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Uh.  Mm-hmm.  British cancer patient, 43, commits suicide.  I'll be next.  May have missed all clear letter.  A cancer patient who hanged himself may not have received a letter from doctors saying he was clear of the illness, official said Monday. 
[01:22:00]  Colin Jackson, 43, underwent intense treatment after being diked.  That is really annoying, that tapping.  I must be low on oil.  Uh, you hear that valve tap.  Never mind.  I guess when you explain, it's not funny.  Uh, but, uh, he underwent, uh, intense treatment after, hey, hear about the circus?  It was intense.  Ha, ha, ha.  Never mind. 
[01:22:30]  What happened to my typewriter?  Every time you bob, I told him to just stop it instead of a car crash.  Oh.  Stop the ticking.  Like my heart.  I think that's tough.  Uh, doctors sent Jackson a letter telling him the treatment was successful and he was free from the disease.  But the local coroner's office said he may not have received the letter because he had recently registered with a different family physician.  Uh, the spokeswoman also said Jackson had no financial worries.  Although Jackson's relationship had recently broken up, that wasn't thought to be the cause. 
[01:23:00]  Jackson's mother, Patricia Emery, said she didn't believe her son received a letter from doctors saying he was cancer-free.  It might have helped, Emery said.  Uh, nothing else is highlighted.  I've been set up.  Uh, you're supposed to do your own news stories.  Yeah.  What are you handing me these things for?  Because you ran out of news.  Brother.  Did you run out of news?  Uh.  Did you run out of news already? 
[01:23:30]  Uh.  Looks like Chris Rock will be hosting the Oscars.  Oh, good.  Despite rumors that he may be kicked off, said the organizers of the event, because he's an edgy comedian and the Oscars will be edgy this year.  And here, there's, uh, we just handed you the lighter side of the news there, Pat, to finish up this newscast.  On a lighter note, woman drunk on Listerine sentenced to two years probation. 
[01:24:00]  Dateline Adrian, Michigan.  A woman who pleaded guilty to driving while drunk on three glasses of Listerine was sentenced Tuesday to two years of probation.  Official suspected Carol Rise, 50, was intoxicated after she rear-ended another vehicle at a red light.  I told the news a joke at that intersection.  Uh, in January.  Sorry, hello, is this thing on?  Police found a bottle of mouthwash in her car.  She passed one breath test, but failed another that used different equipment. 
[01:24:30]  Her blood alcohol level was .30%, more than three times the legal limit.  According to the Listerine manufacturer Pfizer's, Pfizer Inc.'s website, original formula Listerine contains 26.9% alcohol.  More than four times that of many malt liquors.  Uh, while other varieties contained 21.6% alcohol.  Wow.  Uh. 
[01:25:00]  And finally.  Oh, thank God.  I just like when he's looking at the little desperate flip on the back of the page praying there was something there.  There's just nothing there.  Nothing.  Nothing on the front either.  Like my brain scan.  Flat line.  Uh, and now for our final story.  You didn't do sports.  Oh.  True.  You did the, uh, the spring training stuff.  All right, don't worry about it.  Go ahead.  You're taking me out of my moment here.  Oh, go ahead.  Uh, Dateline, Houston, Texas. 
[01:25:30]  Jim Norton at the Improv, February 24th through 26th.  For tickets, call 713-333-333.  No.  Hey, zero, zero.  Uh.  I bet some might pick that up.  All right.  Uh, there it is.  And I got a gift for Anthony.  What?  Uh, a DVD.  All right.  A Leonard Skinner old concert.  Old Leonard Skinner.  The good Leonard Skinner.  Concert DVD.  Why am I a Leonard Skinner fan?  You said you were into the Southern Rock a while back. 
[01:26:00]  It's good concert footage.  A lot of cool, uh, 70s.  Even your gift's bomb.  Earth Mama must.  Why no gift for Opie?  Uh, well, I was going to get him, uh, one of those litter maids, but then I found out  he didn't have a cat.  I didn't mean to bring that up again, but I don't know what happened to that cat.  Maybe he was eating your prime rib.  And something happened.  Ha, ha, very funny, motherfucker.  All right, there he is.  Pat from Munaki.  Pat from Munaki.  Wow, what a bang-up job. 
[01:26:30]  Why don't we, uh...  Oh!  I do mean bang-up.  Why don't we give Pat the papers, and, uh, you can do another, you know, news thing at  eight o'clock.  Yeah, how about that?  Eight o'clock.  Maybe it sounds good.  Maybe some entertainment news.  Maybe some, uh...  Take your comedy writing book.  Maybe you can...  Yeah.  Entertainment news.  We're looking for some sports.  Yeah.  And maybe some gossip.  Ooh.  There you go.  Maybe some gossip.  Okay.  We got a couple of the trashy magazines right there.  Us magazine.  Yeah, yeah.  There.  There's Britney Spears on the cover with the...  He's upset about those pictures. 
[01:27:00]  The exclusive honeymoon photo.  Talk about that.  There you go.  That was leaked.  I love how these pictures are leaked.  Like the clear stuff.  Who do you think leaked the pictures from our honeymoon?  It was great, right, Ben?  Look at it, Ben.  All right.  That's great.  Thank you.  All right, Pat.  Pat, uh, Pat.  Prepare for your eight o'clock newscast, okay?  Okay.  This is what it'll...  Prepare for my eight o'clock newscast.  Like...  Oh, he leaves.  He leaves like a cartoon character. 
[01:27:30]  Like his arms go in one direction, he goes in the other.  Well, let's...  I'm going to go to the instant feedback.  Wow.  I want to see if people liked Pat or not.  They're just...  Let's see.  Are you sure it wasn't, Pat, with the other retard singing time of my life from Dirty Dancing?  That was so bad, I crashed my own car so I could hear the sound.  I like this one.  News from Munaki.  Pat makes me feel like putting a stun gun to my neck. 
[01:28:00]  Now I understand why the orange men killed the Irish.  Pray for a slow news day.  Pray for...  Yeah, it just keeps going on and on.  Very good.  I like Pat doing the news.  Please run out of news.  He just said type a writer.  He did say type a writer.  He's used to the car crash.  He wasn't comfortable without the car crash. 
[01:28:30]  I know.  That's just what we love doing here.  I think for the next newscast, you've got to hit him with the car crash.  Hit him with the car crash?  Yeah.  I thought it was so funny to just hear him go...  Well, after that.  All uncomfortable.  It felt a little too uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I think we need to accent it with the car crash after he does his...  I'm starting to get the Pat from Munaki, by the way.  Oh, please.  I was not a big fan of the Pat from Munaki thing at first.  Guy is a genius.  All right, Anthony.  Pat rules.  More Pat.  Wow. 
[01:29:00]  Give Pat credit.  It's not often someone bombs on the level of a Rich Voss.  Rich doesn't bomb on our phones.  Rich doesn't bomb ever.  It doesn't, no.  Anthony, we got the audio from Monsters Ball.  Really?  We were talking about hot movie scenes yesterday, and that was one that came up.  By the way, a lot of people...  Billy Bob Thornton banging Halle Berry.  A lot of people emailed me and said that they agreed with me that the scene from Traffic is really hot, by the way.  Oh, disturbing.  Not hot.  And then you were telling the story in the office about Swimming Pool? 
[01:29:30]  Swimming Pool, yeah.  And how you watched it the first time?  Oh, yeah, when I was watching it, because Opie was just talking about it nonstop, so I saw it was on.  Well, because the first 20 minutes of the movie stinks.  Yeah, well, it kind of builds up the story, yeah.  You've got to wait.  Right.  But then, so I'm watching it, and I give Opie a call, and I'm like, I'm watching Swimming Pool.  He's like, oh, dude, you're going to love this.  It's so great.  You know, the chick, it's so hot.  The sex scenes are so hot.  So I'm waiting for him, waiting for him.  And Opie then calls me back, did you get to a good scene yet?  I'm like, no, not quite yet. 
[01:30:00]  You know, I'm waiting.  The chick is hot, but I haven't seen her naked yet.  So we hang up again, and then one of the hot scenes come up.  And I called up Opie, and I just get on the phone, and all he hears me do is laughing like a retard.  And he knows what's on the screen.  Oh, what part are you watching?  I'm like, ah, this chick is naked.  Backing the guy in the bedroom.  Yeah, she's begging the dude from the restaurant.  That was a very, very good movie.  Can we get the sex scenes from that movie from Monday's show?  Yeah, we've got to get that one.  We have to.  Yep.  Because this is what you can do on satellite radio. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  You can have a little fun with this.  Do you want to hear the audio from Monsters Ball?  This is Billy Bob banging Halle Berry, right?  After Halle Berry's fat son gets run over by a car, right?  Patrice.  Oh, a big fat thunk on the side of the road in the rain.  That's great.  Here's the audio.  Oh, well, you know what?  Oh, it just made me feel bad.  Oh, it just made me feel good.  This is for Black History Month. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, it just made me feel good.  It just made me feel good.  Oh, it just made me feel good.  Can you make me feel good?  Can you make me feel good?  Can you make me feel good?  Oh, this is audio from the Bill Cosby case after the cold medicine.  Hey, she took the NyQuil.  I can make you feel good.  I can make you feel very good.  Make me feel good. 
[01:31:30]  I feel good.  I can make you feel good.  Just make me feel good.  Just make me feel good.  I can make you feel good.  I want to feel good. actor  car  good 
[01:32:00]  well  up  Hello, exactly. 
[01:32:30]  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[01:33:00]  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world, and I've had him all over the world.  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had.  Have you ever seen the video of that, though? 
[01:33:30]  It was very hot.  This is a giant cock.  It sure is.  Wowie kazowie.  Yeah.  Make me feel good!  Where was I from?  This is a giant cock.  What was I from?  Boogie Nights.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now I've got audio of Billy Bob Thornton two minutes after that scene finished.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:34:00]  Let's take a little snooze.  All right.  Are we sure this isn't footage from one of Bob Crane's movies?  All right.  Wow, that was something.  Yeah, I've seen the scene.  I haven't seen the movie.  I've not seen the whole movie.  Couldn't be bothered.  No, just watch that scene.  The movie's actually pretty good.  Is it? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When are they going to put out DVDs of just, like, kind of like greatest hits or montages?  Just sex scenes?  Well, whatever.  You know, get some kind of theme and just throw it all together on one DVD.  Because a lot of these movies are not worth watching, but there are certain scenes that are cool to check out.  There's some company that put out, like, horror movie greatest scenes and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Freddy Krueger or whatever.  It would probably be hard to get clearances for, you know, sex scenes and stuff.  Robert Englund.  Shit dick! 
[01:35:00]  What?  Remember he came in to see us?  Yes.  Freddy Krueger.  I think there's a market for that, though.  Of course.  Just classic scenes from movies instead of watching the whole damn movie?  Everyone loves celebrity skin.  I think it would be great to have just sex scenes from movies.  Although with the internet now, you can get so many of those if you want.  That's true.  Burn them yourself.  That's what the internet's for.  I mean, you can just go out and grab them.  Do it at home.  Hold on.  What about Steve from PA?  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, guys? 
[01:35:30]  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, you guys need to get that audio from Othello.  Write this down, Eric.  Othello?  With Fishburne?  The black guy keeps telling that white chick to scream, fuck me, you nigger.  Really?  Yeah.  Is that true?  Or is this guy just making a...  No, Eric is nodding his head.  All right, we'll get that audio for the show, too.  Hey, Jimmy.  All right, we're going to...  On Monday, we need the swimming pool.  We need the swimming pool audio.  All right?  Because that is some of the hottest stuff you'll see.  In honor of Pat from Menachie hanging with us today, we got a clip from How's Your News, 
[01:36:00]  Anthony.  It's one of my favorites.  One of these retards going up to Al Franken at one of the conventions and trying to ask  him questions.  And Al Franken is so uncomfortable because he has no idea what the guy's trying to ask him.  Oh, wait.  That's the wrong track, though.  Oh, it is.  Am I...  Yeah, okay.  Here it is.  Here it is.  You know, I didn't understand that.  I'm sorry.  All righty. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm Al Franken, and I'm covering this convention.  Yeah.  And how are you...  Are you having a good time?  I am.  Who have you talked to so far?  I'm sorry.  Bullion.  Bullion.  Maya.  Maya.  You know, I couldn't agree more. 
[01:37:00]  Maya.  Yeah.  It was really nice talking to you.  I'm glad you're here.  Yeah.  I think it's fabulous.  Yeah.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm here.  Can I shake your hand?  Yeah.  Thanks a lot.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  Good thing, man.  Yeah.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Opie and Anthony.  So sit back.  Relax.  Have yourself some herbal tea. 
[01:37:30]  Close your eyes.  And drift away with O&A.  Hey, ass pop.  Hi.  This is great.  You dick.  Bye, I, I.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up. 
[01:38:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know what I hate?  When you're driving and you pick up a friend and they get in and they don't buckle their  seatbelt up like right away, but they will like 10 minutes into the drive after you have  some goofy turn.  Without sending to you, they'll just, you know, pull that belt down.  Oh, you got a problem all of a sudden?  So what I do, as they're looking down, I go, ah, ah, ah, ah, these darn mosquitoes. 
[01:38:30]  I don't know why I let them bother me like that.  I really shouldn't.  I don't know why I let them do this shit.  Yes, indeedy, boy.  I got a jaywalking ticket yesterday.  Motherfuckers ain't got shit better to do than to fuck with you for jaywalking.  If that lets you know how deep the government is in your business, how the fuck else I'm 
[01:39:00]  going to get across the street and walk.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, jaywalking.  Oh, ain't that a bitch.  It's like the first motherfucker that did that shit, his name must have been jay.  You know what I'm saying?  Jay's like, I'm tired of being the last one at the bank.  Fuck it, I'm going now.  A little cop there with his whistle.  Hey, jay, hey, in my hands? 
[01:39:30]  Fuck your hands.  I'm going to the bank.  Then everybody else.  You know, jay's always the first one in line.  Let's go when jay goes.  You know what I'm saying?  Shit became an epidemic.  They're all jaywalking.  You know what I'm saying?  What are they going to do when somebody in the wheelchair do it?  Call it Mike Rowland?  It's the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[01:40:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  Spreading across America on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:40:30]  If you like what you're hearing, tell your friends about us, please.  We could use the help.  Do you know Patty's body looks like a pregnant snake?  Just because she tapers off and gets like bigger in the middle and then kind of gets thin back at the end again.  I'm not knocking you, Patty.  She's like skinny fat.  I don't know.  She's like, there's something going on there.  Like she's a thin person, but...  Oh, she's elderly.  I'm not elderly.  You're elderly, so you're skinny.  And when old people are skinny, they get that belly on them because gravity just pulls everything down. 
[01:41:00]  I just think I need a little trip to the gym that's in my building.  That's all.  I'm going to start cycling.  Cycling.  You're going to start cycling.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're going to do that?  Yeah.  Well, I'm eating differently, too, because, you know, when I take the medication, especially the Altase that they have me on, I don't know how to say it.  It's some kind of heart medication.  Altase. 
[01:41:30]  What amazes me about Starker Patty, how she accents words in the wrong places.  I know I stink at talking at times, but it's just amazing.  I have good hygiene.  That was the one she used to say.  She used to say that all the time.  That's the weirdest thing, man.  I have good hygiene.  I'm sorry.  I didn't talk until I was three, so...  You didn't talk until you were three?  That's right.  I didn't.  We have something in common.  My mom told me I didn't start talking until I was three. 
[01:42:00]  Really?  Yeah.  How about that?  I had nothing good to say.  Nothing to say.  That's what I was going to say.  And then she goes, I haven't stopped talking since.  Oh, no.  They used to tell me that I used to...  The wind guard came flying off the mic when he did that.  They used to say that I used to talk people deaf, dumb, and blind when I was a little kid.  Yeah.  I haven't stopped.  Yeah, really.  That's great.  Thanks for the setup.  That one was too easy.  Yeah.  That's when you're at home plate and you just step aside. 
[01:42:30]  Let that one go by.  Way too easy.  Way too easy.  But before we get to Stark and Patty, we've got to tell everyone we did our VO, as they  call it in the biz, for the TV commercial.  That's going to start airing, I guess, next week, huh?  Is it?  Next week?  Yeah.  We get a 10-second commercial.  10 seconds.  That's going to be shown on New York TV, Boston, Philly.  What's it going to air on?  What channel?  Supposedly they're telling us during the Today Show when they go local. 
[01:43:00]  When they go local?  It'll be like a 10-second spot.  They're going to show the MiFi.  It'll say high voltage, Opie and Anthony, and then us saying something really stupid.  I'm sure, because that's all we were saying in that room yesterday was something stupid.  Well, it's kind of exciting.  Sure.  It's a start.  It is a start, indeed.  It's a move in the right direction.  Mm-hmm.  So, Starker Patty, why are you here today?  I got an email from Ben the other day that he had a surprise for me.  That is a surprise for me. 
[01:43:30]  And then he told me to have a couple of news stories in case you wanted me to do the news.  And we got Pat.  We got Pat today.  Why would we need you if we got Pat?  I enjoy his threads.  His what?  His threads on Wackbag.  His part of the board.  Are you on Wackbag?  Do you have a name on Wackbag?  Yeah, I go under my own name, Starker Patty.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Where's Ben?  We should bring Ben in here.  Yeah, get Ben.  So, he has a surprise for Stalker Patty. 
[01:44:00]  What else have you been up to, Patty?  Me?  Well, I worked a lot of hours over the weekend and this week because of Valentine's Day.  I came in at five in the morning.  Does that S just go right through you?  That whistling S that she has?  Because it whistles where it's like an ice pick going through my ear.  I don't know, but it sure is hot in here.  No?  Nothing. 
[01:44:30]  What's the way?  Nothing.  That's good.  So, you can get your face kicked in for 15 seconds.  Yeah, before anybody comes in to help us.  Don't explain that one for a while.  All right.  Oh, my God.  It is hot in here.  I'm just sweating.  Damn.  Blazing.  Steve's not even in here.  Yeah, turn on the A.C.  It's hot in here.  So, yeah, you worked a lot of hours because it was Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  Thank you very much. 
[01:45:00]  Everyone digging the chocolate strawberries.  Oh, I'm glad.  We were dipping all morning.  So, I said to my boss, let me bring some stuff, some of these over to the Brooklyn Diner and to the station.  He said, yeah, go ahead.  So, I did.  So, Alexis and Mike got strawberries, too.  We were.  All right.  Now, we've got to let everyone in on the show.  We just wanted to see if it worked.  You're the best.  Oh, wow.  Nothing's going to ever keep you down. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, wow.  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  Look at that.  Oh, wow.  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  All right.  Now, we have to explain because it's radio.  That was really funny.  That was really funny, man.  Here, Patty, give up your mic for a second.  We've got to get Master Poe in here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sex, man, I'll give Master Poe a throw.  I'll give you this.  Hey, you can see it.  Are you sure?  Move, Patty. 
[01:46:00]  That's going to be the biggest laugh of the week.  Oh, man.  It means nothing to the listeners.  We'll try to make sense of this.  But Master Poe came in this morning around, what, 530, whatever?  Yeah.  And he pulled me aside.  He goes, was everything all right with you guys and Charlie Murphy yesterday?  Charlie Murphy.  Because I was sensing something over the radio that there may have been a problem or could  have been a problem with Charlie Murphy.  There wasn't.  Charlie was totally cool.  I'm like, no, he's just an intense guy.  You know, I think it's just his demeanor.  He's just one of these guys that is a black guy. 
[01:46:30]  No, he's got that vibe where you think he's going to strangle somebody and then he just  laughs and you realize that's just the way he's just like an intense dude.  Charlie Murphy's crazy.  So Master Poe's like, you know, we really need some kind of code in case, you know, you  guys are in trouble in the studio.  And then he comes up with the code.  If there's something going on in the studio that you're uncomfortable with, just casually  say on the air, stop it, Opie. 
[01:47:00]  No, no, no.  No, just say, you know, it's hot in here.  Or boy, it's getting hot in here.  But what if it was hot in here?  Because sometimes the temperature is a little weird and we go, you know, God, it's hot in  here today.  Yeah.  You know, and then that might be a false alarm.  So I'm like, all right, Master Poe, cool, no problem.  As soon as he walks away, I'm like, dude, I tell Anthony, I tell Jim, I tell everybody.  I'm like, first opportunity we get, we got to say it's hot in here.  And you guys just heard that on the radio about five minutes ago.  Well, just before that, Master Poe escorted our next guest into the studio. 
[01:47:30]  He's now sitting on the lesbian couch.  Yeah.  And then he just left.  And then we started talking to Stalker Patty.  And then you heard us all go, it's hot in here.  But it's funny because he was walking outside the window.  We saw him walking outside the window.  And there's a delay.  So he wasn't able to hear us say it's hot in here until we could have all just been  killed.  And then you hear the delay.  But the way he came bursting through the door, you came, I saw you running and then burst  through the door and look around like, where's the problem? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, and he got into fighting position.  I know.  He was ready to go.  Ready to kick some ass.  But the problem we saw with the code word, although it's a good idea, is that because  outside in the office, they're hearing the same feed that you hear, which is a bounce from  a satellite, which is about 15 seconds.  Yeah.  So what Charlie Murphy was punching my face for 15 seconds.  Yeah.  I mean, Poe might have come in and prevented my leg from being ripped off.  Yeah.  And saved, like, so the casket could be opened from the knees down.  I think Charlie Murphy could do a lot of damage to me in 15 seconds. 
[01:48:30]  But that's the problem with the code word.  Poe comes running in.  The police tapes up.  EMS is wheeling us all out.  They're investigating the scene, dusting for prints.  Classic.  But, man, he came in quick as soon as he heard it, though.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was ready to pounce.  Yeah.  That's where we started laughing really, really hard.  And he starts pointing at Patty and laughing like she's the threat.  Right.  I have an idea for the new code.  If there's ever a problem, we'll have Ben run out with his hair combed. 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  There's no way we can screw that up.  There's no false alarms there.  That was hilarious.  Yeah.  If Ben herks or jerks, come in.  Now you guys will appreciate that on the replay.  There you go.  Now that you got the explanation.  Yeah, we have to have a system that's not a code word, though, because code words get  the delay outside.  Yeah, there's a delay.  Right.  We need, like, a button in here, a panic button that will then raise an alarm.  And the funny thing is, I go, Poe, you know what, you'll know when there's a problem because 
[01:49:30]  I'll punch somebody.  And he kind of laughs.  I go, no, really, it's happened two or three times already live on the show.  So thank you, Master Poe.  That was my pleasure.  We tested you, and you were great, man.  Thank you very much.  You had to come right in.  Wouldn't it be funny if you had just, like, clotheslined Patty and knocked it out?  Oh, yes.  Her head goes rolling across the...  Really?  When he comes to the Poe, he just starts hitting her.  Why are you hitting me?  No need to use carat√© on me.  Carat√©. 
[01:50:00]  You know, I heard you're pretty good at jiu-jitsu.  What do you do?  What a tard.  Patty, your teeth are getting smaller and smaller.  What's going on, man?  Are you grinding them?  They used to be little chiclet size, and now they're the size of Ben's cell phone.  No.  Just tiny little teeth.  You've got, like, baby teeth.  What happened?  You've got, like, little...  Did they ever fall out the first time?  No.  They're the same size as they were when she was left in that diner as a child in a basket  at the foundling place. 
[01:50:30]  I was a foundling.  You know, I'm starting to get messages on my e-mails from the AARP.  Of course, I delete them, but that's scaring me.  AARP?  She calls it the AARP.  AARP.  That's the old age organization.  I'm starting to get e-mails from ARBs.  They say when you hit 50, you start getting things, and that's one of them.  Oh, Jesus.  So how are you doing financially, Patty?  You could always use a little extra cash, right? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, where's Ben?  Yeah, the only thing I'm behind on is just my phone bill, but other than that, everything  else is fine.  Your phone bill?  How much is your phone bill every month?  Oh, I pay a lot.  It's $62 a month.  Isn't that like...  It's a flat rate, though.  Basically, everybody's phone bill is probably about $60.  Yeah, more or less, yeah.  Yeah, well, you pay a flat rate.  You got a cell phone?  Yes, I do, and that's another $43.97 more.  All right, listen.  How many minutes do you give a $43?  Eight minutes a month?  Unlimited.  All right.  Unlimited.  All right, listen, Patty, I'm going to save you $62. 
[01:51:30]  Get rid of the house phone.  Yeah, what do you need the phone?  No, I have dial-up on my computer.  I need the phone.  Oh, dial-up.  Don't you have cable?  She's the one.  I can't afford that, and I got a...  Are people still using dial-up?  Yeah, well, I'm still using my friend's old computer that I bought two years ago and  still sharing the email account because I can't really afford to have my own yet.  Well, Patty's not going to need anything really for dial-up, like broadband.  Oh, man.  She's probably just chatting.  You're not downloading donkey videos. 
[01:52:00]  All I do is go on websites.  I'm on a heart center online to learn more about my heart condition, and I just email,  and I am people, and I have a little buddy list, too.  You know what's a sick thing?  Patty uses the internet for what you're supposed to use it for.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  Disgusting.  Chatting in a nice way, checking out some medical things.  Right.  Yeah.  Some dining tips.  Yeah, and I go on all the O.P. Anthony and Ron's board.  You don't look at naked people websites?  No.  Because...  You never look at anything dirty, ever?  I can't. 
[01:52:30]  I share the account.  What if that shows up on their computer?  I've been curious enough to want to go into certain things on boundary, but I don't want  to do that for my protection and theirs.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Do you share the actual computer or just an email account?  An email account.  I'm the second name on the account.  Yeah, but you can go on websites on your computer, and nothing's going to show up in  a shared email account.  But sometimes I get their email by mistake or, you know, and stuff like my gold points 
[01:53:00]  from Food Emporium and stuff, you know.  So if that can show up in my email, then anything I go on, they can find themselves...  What are gold points?  Oh, I go to the supermarket, you spend $50 a month in produce, you get 100 points, and  later, you know, and another 2,000 points, I can redeem it and get a $20 gift certificate  and stuff like that, you know.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, what... 
[01:53:30]  Oh, my God.  You said you were curious about some websites.  Name one.  Oh, there's a lot of stuff on Foundry I'd like to look at, just for curiosity.  Like what?  Like what?  Like what?  Oh, I don't know.  Some of the...  Does Steve have gay porn on there?  I don't know.  I was looking into big black ass mashers.  Well, you know, let's just see what sort of stuff is there, but I don't dare because  I don't want to...  Do we have a Hustler magazine around here?  This chick has to look at porn.  Patty, it won't show up in their email account.  Get a Hustler.  It'll work that way. 
[01:54:00]  Get a Hustler.  You'll never know.  All right.  Patty, there's Hustler magazine.  Yes.  We want you to thumb through that.  Okay.  Take a look.  Take a look and tell us...  Take a look and let us know what you see.  Because it's radio.  This must be what it's like for Michael Jackson.  Just showing little children.  Just look.  It's nothing new.  That girl doesn't have anything I don't have.  Yes, she does.  She does.  She's got curves.  More dignity.  Well, you know.  She's got breasts.  Yeah.  Michael Rupert, the end of Peek Oil.  She's reading. 
[01:54:30]  It's not the articles.  Look at...  Get to the point where the...  No, no worries.  Don't worry.  Some girl's getting...  There you go.  What do you think, Patty?  Now, that's something you don't have.  Why don't you explain...  Hold on.  Why don't you explain that?  Look at the copyright.  This is the first time she's looking at porn, I bet you, in a long time.  Right, Patty?  Patty, explain what you're saying.  She can't control herself.  She's laughing.  Well, I see a girl eating a lollipop.  All right.  Very nice.  Keep going.  And I see a girl making whoopee.  What's making whoopee?  Making whoopee?  What is this?  Hold on.  Go back to that page. 
[01:55:00]  Back to the page.  What do you mean making whoopee?  Describe it.  Yeah.  Well, she's literally having sex with the guy.  What kind of sex?  Regular, I guess.  Regular sex?  Well, what is she doing in this top right picture?  Eating a lollipop.  No, it's not a lollipop.  That's not a lollipop.  What is she doing, Patty?  Describe it for our listeners.  Look, I'm a nice lady.  We understand that.  You're describing it for the listeners. 
[01:55:30]  For the listeners.  It's part of radio.  You're in character.  She's painting a picture for the listeners.  It's not like you do it.  Well, she's eating lunch.  Just say what she's doing.  Patty, you know what it is.  You're an adult.  Please convey to the listeners what the picture is you're looking at.  This is satellite radio.  You can say it.  She has the guy's thing out and she's eating it.  What do you mean by thing?  Yeah, what thing?  That could be anything. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, come on.  Patty, you're not doing a good job.  In detail, describe that picture to our listeners.  Yes, please.  The phallic symbol.  It's not a phallic symbol.  What is it?  The penis.  All right, what is she doing with the penis?  All right, and what is she doing with it?  She's eating it.  How is she eating it?  With a knife and fork on a plate with some mustard?  Yeah.  A little sausage?  Oh, no.  It's finger food.  Patty.  You don't eat penis.  Where is the man's penis? 
[01:56:30]  In her mouth.  In her mouth.  Yuck.  So she is...  What is the term?  Wait, did you just say yuck?  Yeah, yuck.  That's good stuff.  Ugh.  Oh, look.  She's giving the little fish eye.  That's good stuff.  All right.  Why are you saying yuck, Patty?  What do you think of that, Patty?  What do you think of that picture?  I don't know.  Or how smart are those ladies, though?  They don't seem very bright.  They get whatever they want, though, Patty. 
[01:57:00]  She's an Einstein.  They don't have dial-up.  No, they have DSL.  Yes, they do.  That's right.  Dick-sucking lips.  All right, why don't you turn the page, Patty, and tell us what's going on now.  Oh, look at the first picture you come to at the top of that page, Patty.  Is that what they call T-F-ing? 
[01:57:30]  Yes, Patty.  That is T-F-ing.  And you know who explains what that was to me?  What?  Because I wasn't sure of what it was, and I asked.  Jimmy Norton.  No.  Who?  Joe did.  Joe who?  I was at the bar nine.  My brother?  Yeah, and I said, I wonder what that is.  He says, Patty, let me explain it to you.  Zip.  How did he explain it to you?  He said, it's when you...  You know those two things you don't have?  Yeah, you put it between the boobs. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  I was like, oh, no.  I was so shocked when he explained that to me.  Put what between the boobs.  Even more shocked when he did it.  Patty, you don't have any boobs, so you can't do that maneuver.  No.  Patty, look at the other picture of the guy standing up and the girl bending over now.  Please explain that to our listeners.  Okay.  She appears to be, I don't know what they call it, but taking it in the rear? 
[01:58:30]  Well, I don't think she is, though.  This is actually just conventional sex, but it's done with her bending over in front of the guy.  Then why wouldn't she go the other way?  Exactly, Patty.  Why wouldn't she?  Now you're learning.  So they're standing up and the guy is doing what to her?  He's, well, they're having fun.  Fun. 
[01:59:00]  What, are they waiting on line for a roller coaster fun?  Oh, they're on a roller coaster, right?  Be graphic, Patty.  Yeah, be graphic.  Give details.  It's radio.  What are they doing?  Come on.  What are they doing?  Loosen up.  Yeah, loosen up a little bit.  You're going to be 50 in a few months.  Come on.  You're a 50-year-old woman.  Let's go.  You're a virgin.  Relax.  Well, they look like they're having sex.  Relax.  They are.  I mean, look, half of it's gone there.  You see that?  Turn the page, Patty. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Turn the page.  All right.  Now what do you see?  Now.  Doesn't that look like something that would be fun to do?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Why?  What's not fun?  Which picture?  It looks messy.  Oh, she's looking at the last picture.  Look at the last picture, Patty.  See, what is her face covered in, Patty?  That's what we call a good egg.  Covered in egg. 
[02:00:00]  No, it's not egg.  Why are you saying ew?  That's wonderful, Patty.  What do you think of that picture?  Shocking.  You wouldn't want maybe, you know, some guy you're intimate with to do that to you?  I don't know if it really happens that way.  Oh, it does.  Would you take a load in that fashion?  Like you say I love you and he uses your face as a Kleenex?  See, I'm as conventional as they come. 
[02:00:30]  No, you're not conventional.  All right, Patty, go to page 50.  Go to page 50.  Everyone turn to page 53.  All right.  All right, Opie.  Page 53.  You see what's going on in the upper right-hand corner?  That is exactly the next picture I want.  Taking a porn star home to meet mom.  It would have to be.  God damn it, I can never find the page numbers on Hustler.  53, sweetie.  Right there, you got it.  Right there.  Atta boy. 
[02:01:00]  The upper right corner.  Describe what's going on there, Patty.  She looks very contorted.  Yes.  And?  Ow.  It doesn't look too comfortable at all.  What is she doing?  I don't know.  I don't know where her legs are.  Her legs are pretty much behind her neck.  Her knees are up to her ears, Patty.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And she's laying on top of a gentleman.  Oh, wait.  Is that called the wheelbarrow?  No.  No.  Not even. 
[02:01:30]  Faces all the way forward where it looks like she could almost take care of herself.  Yeah.  And then what is that?  And where is it?  Oh, it's...  Oh, wait a minute.  That's the other way.  What?  Right.  That's being done in the can.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Sexy, right?  Uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable.  Painful.  All right.  It must hurt.  Why don't we go to Tarney and Candy, the desert flowers. 
[02:02:00]  Ooh.  What page?  Just a couple pages more.  Lesbo.  Lesbo scene.  Yeah.  Why don't you move a couple...  There you go.  Right there, Patty.  Two beautiful girls out in the desert.  Actually, turn the page because they're just getting to know each other in the first couple  shots.  See the big picture on the right side there?  Yes, I do.  All right.  It's two girls.  A blonde and a brunette.  They're in the middle of the desert.  They're completely naked.  What's going on there?  Oh, it looks like one of them is giving treats to the other one.  What do you mean, giving treats? 
[02:02:30]  Oral treats.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You find that hot?  No.  Why not?  Because I don't go that way.  I don't...  No.  You don't go any way.  No.  No.  I'm not into the girl on girl.  That's not me.  You're not into anything.  I'm not into guy on girl.  You're not into guys.  You're not straight.  You're asexual.  I am.  I mean, I'm into guys, but...  You're not.  You are asexual.  You're like a roach.  You just kind of reproduce on your own.  Go to page 91, Patty.  Patty, 91, please. 
[02:03:00]  91.  That's a whole smorgasbord of stills from porn movies.  All right.  Now, Patty, what do you think of some of the oral scenes there?  Would that be something maybe you would want to do, somebody you care about?  Well, um, okay.  Yeah?  If it's somebody I cared about, but only with somebody I cared about, but I don't think I 
[02:03:30]  would want to share it with five other people.  Oh, well, that's just a little orgy.  Oh.  No one's looking.  You would actually put that in your mouth, Patty?  No.  I don't know.  Somebody you care about?  Somebody you care about?  See, I'm not in that situation, so I don't know how I'd be when I was there, you know.  What if he said, you know, wow, Patty, come on, I really need this, you know, and you're  in love, and, you know, you realize you want to do something for the guy you're in love with? 
[02:04:00]  I'd be afraid that he would think that I was a bad person if I did that.  What?  No.  No.  That's the best person you could ever be.  What you're going to hear is, you're a good girl.  Right.  You'll get a little pat on top of your head, a little tussle of your hair, and then a hard  push to the back of your head.  Oh, he would respect you, all right.  That's the utmost in respect.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we go to page 143? 
[02:04:30]  143 in your workbooks, kids, everybody.  143.  143.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  Let's see what you think of that.  We're looking at the upper right-hand corner of the page, okay?  Of course.  Yeah.  Patty, what do you think of that?  Why don't you describe that?  Is that what they call a chick with a D?  With a what?  A D.  What's a D?  Just say it, for God's sake.  And we're on satellite radio.  I'm embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed. 
[02:05:00]  Say it.  A chick with a what?  Yeah, talk like a trucker for once.  Come on, Patty.  A chick with dicks.  Go ahead.  You filthy whore.  That's right, potty mouth, dirty mouth slut.  That's right.  We're going to wash your mouth out with soap.  Oh, God.  What do you think, Patty?  What do you think's going on there?  I think she's going through a sex change, right?  And she's not done yet?  No, some just go halfway like that. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Unless she's a hermaphrodite.  No, that seems to just be somebody waiting for Jim Norton to make an offer.  You could catch her in Christmas with the cranks.  What do you think there, Patty?  Well, turn the next page.  I'm glad that wouldn't be me.  Turn to the next page and look in the upper right.  All right.  Yeah, I see it.  See, that's another one.  1-800-591-HOT.  Wow.  That makes me want to just dial it up, doesn't it? 
[02:06:00]  Oh, God.  No.  Why don't you read the little tagline at the bottom, right under her penis?  Try me if you got the balls.  I do.  The balls?  The balls.  What are balls?  I do.  I do.  All right.  Oh, God.  That's pretty...  She's a freak.  Patty, turn the page again. 
[02:06:30]  Oh.  Go to upper right-hand corner.  Yeah, almost a lady.  Yeah, read that whole thing.  What page, sweetie?  Almost a lady.  147.  If my tits don't attract you, my cock will.  No credit card needed.  Very good.  All right.  You don't have to give out the number.  What do you think of the stud to the left of that little lady?  The stud?  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Wow.  He looks a little turned on to me.  Not to you.  Not to you.  No.  That's what I think.  Why don't you read that ad without the phone numbers?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Gay dudes want to play with you.  Come out and play hard...  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Patty.  It's just reading.  It's just reading. 
[02:07:30]  Reading's fundamental.  Go ahead, Patty.  Hard bodies and hotter cocks.  This one rocks.  She's getting all turned on.  What?  You're 490 prick?  Yes, it's 490 prick.  I don't think so.  No?  No, huh?  I don't think so.  Go to page 151. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Upper right corner.  Read that in.  What am I doing?  151.  Where...  What am I thinking?  Read that ad.  Just read it.  Just read it.  And then this one, too, Eric.  Stop laughing.  Just read it.  Be a professional.  Yeah, go ahead.  Be a professional broadcaster.  After...  After...  After I suck you off...  After I suck you off, I want you to stroke my she-male cock and bring me up the ass. 
[02:08:30]  Bring me up the ass.  Would you read that right?  You're missing words.  Yeah.  Stop breathing at the time when dirty words come off.  Stop it.  Just read it like a professional.  She's getting really turned on.  Go ahead.  Read it again.  Read it again.  After I suck you off, I want you to stroke me my she-male cock and bring me up the ass.  That is not bring! 
[02:09:00]  Not bring me.  And bang me up the ass.  Right.  Bang me up the ass.  1-800-EAT.  No, no, no.  We don't need the numbers.  Meat.  All right.  Go to that other one.  Ass-tounding strap-on penetration.  We'll do what your girlfriend won't.  Oh.  Oh, look at that.  Probably me, either.  No, 151.  Read the one.  I'm with this girlfriend.  Read that title.  Which one? 
[02:09:30]  151.  The top one.  You're bad.  My bad.  Go ahead.  Yeah, read it.  My bad.  Suck me dry.  Wait, no.  Where are you going?  In the middle.  Yeah, right there.  Come on, Patty.  No laughing.  Yeah, no laughing.  Read this professionally.  I'm hungry for a big fat male cock.  It doesn't say juicy.  It says juicy.  Read it right.  What are you doing?  She's losing her mind is what's happening.  Patty.  Oh, I'm hungry for a big fat juicy cock. 
[02:10:00]  Now, make sure you're reading this properly.  Read the other side of that ad.  Yeah.  Let me see.  Right there.  And no laughing.  No laughing.  Professional.  Let me see what that one.  Okay, hold on.  Shoot your big wad of cum.  Get on, Mike.  Of cum.  Wait, start off.  Shoot your big wad of cum right into my mouth.  You are corrupting me.  And what about the one right to the right of his huge schlong? 
[02:10:30]  No, we did that one.  The shemale one?  No.  He means the words.  Oh, where?  Right there.  Check your huge cock in my...  No, no, wait a minute.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  I've never heard these lines less sexy.  She has the sex appeal of Gene Stapleton.  Archie, I was raped.  Oh, that's a hot episode of All in the Family.  Thanks.  I thought it was a comedy. 
[02:11:00]  Exactly.  All right, Patty.  All right, Patty.  You've done a great job.  That's very nice.  I'm a sport.  All right, well, we're going to let Patty know why she's here after the break.  All right.  Because I've got to take a quick leak.  And then we've got Pat from Monaki doing the news again.  Oh.  What am I going to...  And we need something to play and to break.  Is that a good song, though?  Internet porn?  Yeah, Brother Joe.  Brother Joe, Internet porn.  Is this good?  I don't even...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this was the...  I'm trying to remember this one.  Neil Diamond song.  I like the banana song. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, you like that.  Yes, you do, don't you?  It's my favorite song.  Because you're a filthy whore, Patty.  Oh, you heard your potty mouth reading stuff like this?  What are people looking for?  She's dancing.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Banana phone.  Banana phone.

[02:13:00]  Look at what I've done.  My keyboard, it's a mess.  I should pick up that pile of Kleenex in the corner of my room.  I can't use the word come in the context of this song.  Internet porn.  So I'll just say, shoot, spew, and spurt.  That verse I wrote for me. 
[02:13:30]  Internet porn.  I jerked all night like retards, do they say?  Whether you're hetero, bisexual, or gay.  Internet porn will always make you feel that way. 
[02:14:00]  Welcome.  Bye, old guy.  Goodbye.  Internet porn.  Too many hours whacking.  I've been up for days.  Pounding my pun until it looked like mule pate. 
[02:14:30]  Internet porno always makes me feel that way.  Internet porn.  My family has not seen me for days.  And my wife is pissed, cause she's not getting laid. 
[02:15:00]  Internet porno always makes you feel that way.  Baby, let me wrap these lips around you.  Nice and tight.  Internet porno always makes me feel this way.  I don't know.  I don't know.  State of the Union.

[02:17:30]  Opie and Anthony on High Voltage XM 202.  XM News, talk, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Bill from Tappan, New Jersey. 
[02:18:00]  It sounds like you're trying to teach someone to read after a massive head injury.  It certainly does.  Your reading skills are really bad, Patty.  I think she was just uncomfortable reading this stuff. 
[02:18:30]  You think that was it?  We want her to read a penthouse form or something.  We want her to read one sexy story before we get off the air for the weekend.  Sexy.  But first, the real reason we got Patty in here.  Yes.  Patty.  Do you remember when, I think it was our Christmas present, Anthony?  I think it was our Christmas present.  Yeah.  Get on, Mike.  What was the Christmas present again that we hated?  Oh, two nameplates.  Nameplates, like you'd see in an office setting on the boss's desk. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  You know, it says Perry White Editor, something like that.  Yes.  Yeah.  In fact, the next day when they were up on eBay, I almost had an asthma attack.  I was, like, surprised.  Why?  I was so surprised.  Why?  I don't know.  They say Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  One on each plate.  And it says WOW also on it in the WOW logo.  And, you know, you went through a lot of trouble to get these made for us, right? 
[02:19:30]  Took a while to get them mailed to you?  Well, I had to pick them up, but it took three weeks to make them.  Three weeks.  How much did they cost?  Close to, like, I don't know, $17 each or something like that.  $17 each, so, you know, $34, $35 to...  Well, no, that's a lot of money for you, Patty.  We know that.  Someone who can't pay their phone bill right now.  That's almost a month of your phone bill, right?  That's, yeah, half of my phone bill, yeah.  Right.  Or almost the amount of your cell phone. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Which was $42, which was close to $34.  That's what I was getting at, but who cares?  All right, so then we hated the gift, and we threw it away and stuff,  and then someone got the bright idea to throw it on eBay, like, sign it.  Yep.  And throw it on eBay.  Yeah, so we signed them.  They went up on eBay.  When they go up there.  Wow.  Like, right after...  Well, the auction ended January 30th, 05.  A couple weeks ago. 
[02:20:30]  Patty?  Yeah.  And the final bid was $770.  Oh, my God.  $770.  $770, Patty.  So we decided we would give you back the $35 that you spent on it.  That's nice of us, right?  Yeah.  And we would keep the rest and maybe, you know, I don't know, maybe...  It wasn't you that sold them.  We could put them on eBay.  Yeah, and then we would maybe blow the money on lap dances or something. 
[02:21:00]  You don't mind.  Yeah.  Go to a strip club with the rest of it.  But at least you get your money back, right?  You get your $35 back.  $34, actually.  Someone make change.  $34.  We'll give you an even $40.  Wow.  Right?  Come out of your money.  No.  Not mine.  So where's the guy that...  The winning bidder is here.  Oh.  Oh.  And usually when items go up on eBay, a lot of times they end up not...  Phonies usually buy it.  Not panning out.  They don't pay for it.  No, they keep... 
[02:21:30]  Well, somehow we gotta...  We need both of...  New Zealand.  Well, Anthony hates...  That's okay.  Bring him over.  All right, bring him over.  Oh, look at me yawning.  I love this segment.  Well, you do.  Hey, what's your name, bro?  Tony Rivoli.  Hey, Tony.  Big fan of the show?  Absolutely.  And you must be loaded.  Why would you bid $770 on these cheap nameplates?  Well, I'm a fan of the show and I figure I could give my restaurant a plug.  Oh.  Hey.  Look at that. 
[02:22:00]  It actually works out financially.  It works out for the guy.  Actually, that's very smart.  Where's your restaurant?  In Tom's River, New Jersey.  And what's the name of it?  Rivoli's Restaurant.  Yeah.  Well, talk about it a little bit.  Yeah.  I'll give you...  You know what?  Because you...  You spent $770 on these cheap nameplates.  Talk about your restaurant for 30 seconds.  Go.  781 Fisher Boulevard, Italian Cuisine.  Huge portions.  Family atmosphere.  732-270-3634.  But I will be the guest chef in Houston, Texas at the Improv February 24th through the 27th. 
[02:22:30]  Jimmy, what's the phone number?  I don't have it with me, but we'll get it.  Wow, that was good.  Dude, you got nine seconds left.  Go.  Rivoli's Restaurant, Tom's River, New Jersey.  What's the address?  781 Fisher Boulevard.  Yeah.  And if you go to the restaurant, just tell them Opie and Anthony sent you, right?  Just so you get...  You get a free appetizer.  A free appetizer.  You mentioned Opie and Anthony.  Free appetizer.  What's your number?  We will give it out again.  732-270-3634.  Yeah, this guy is... 
[02:23:00]  He's pretty cool.  So if you're in the area and you're looking to go out this weekend, then why don't you check  out his restaurant?  What the hell, right?  That's very cool.  I bought gift cards for you guys.  Did you?  But you can't put them on eBay.  No, we won't do that.  Don't worry about that.  So you're really going to fork over like $770 right now?  Wow.  He's got it on him.  Wow.  There it is.  Let me see.  Give it a little count.  There's a lot of hundreds in there, Anthony.  Listen up, Bob Kelly.  This is two weeks on the road for you.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven hundred, fifty, sixty, seventy. 
[02:23:30]  Wow.  There it is.  Man.  Nice.  Very good.  All right.  There you go.  No, no, no.  You've got to take out 34.  34.  Yeah, give...  No, give Patty 40.  I need to give her only 40 banks for this.  Yeah.  Actually, there's only a 50 here.  Here, I'll give you 50.  I'm a nice guy.  Wow.  50 bucks, Patty.  Here you go. 
[02:24:00]  50 bucks, Patty.  Pretty nice of us, huh?  Yeah.  Give me $15.  What are you going to do with that 50?  Put it in the bank.  Put it in the bank?  Yeah.  What, so it gains interest?  And use it to pay my bills.  Use it to pay your bills?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not going to use any for maybe a little entertainment?  Oh, $50 isn't enough.  I got to...  All right.  Here's another 20.  Jesus.  All right.  It's 70.  That it?  All right.  Now, what are you going to do with 70?  70?  Well, pay my phone bill and then pay for bowling. 
[02:24:30]  Bowling?  Tonight's my league.  I'm on a league once a week.  She's on the bowling league.  What's your average?  I hope Dolph Sweet holds her down and drops a bowling ball in her arm.  Oh, I'm proud of my average.  It's 141.  141?  Yes.  141 average.  And I missed a 200 by seven pins last time.  Wow.  Patty.  I will give you $100 if you flash everyone right now.  $100.  You want $100? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  She flashed.  All right.  All right.  You know what it's going to cost?  Are you going to want $100 for that?  Oh, what's it going to cost?  Why not?  What's it going to cost to see the pads?  Oh, my God.  I'll put my mule in it for $200.  Oh, my God.  Well, $100, Patty, you know.  It's like, do we have the old theme to Let's Make a Deal?  You want to play Let's Make a Deal, Patty?  Let's make a deal.  We have how much more? 
[02:25:30]  About $600 left.  Ladies and gentlemen, one.  Count along, everybody.  One, two, three, four, five, $600.  Patty, I am holding in my hand $600 that can be yours if you want to make a deal.  Patty, you want to make a deal?  Yeah.  Yes, Patty wants to play Let's Make a Deal.  Break out the dildo.  Patty, you've already...  If we could get the wiffle ball back down here.  Oh, no.  I'm like, he's horrified. 
[02:26:00]  Patty?  That was a bat's reaction.  All right, hold on, Anthony.  We've got the music for you.  I'm sorry.  Very good.  Here's Derek, I think.  There you go.  Welcome to Let's Make a Deal.  Now, today, I'm going to make the first deal very simple.  Very, very simple.  See the box down there on the display floor.  See the girl stand beside the box on the display floor.  See the girl remove the box from what's down there on the display floor.  And what have we got down there, buddy?  A beautiful colored TV console.  Do you remember how it was played?  Yeah.  Patty, there'd be people in the audience.  They would dress all weird and, you know, well, I guess that could be you. 
[02:26:30]  And then they would do things in exchange for money and prizes on Let's Make a Deal.  Yeah.  So you've already played.  You've flashed for $100.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  $200?  Whoa.  Patty, what would you do with $200?  Oh, my God.  I would pay some rent with that.  And I've always wanted a portable DVD player. 
[02:27:00]  Wow.  Patty, a portable DVD player and paying for a little bit of rent.  $200.  You really want this, don't you?  Yeah.  Yes, you do.  Look at the pictures of Ben Franklin staring back at you saying, Patty, I could help you get that portable DVD player.  And pay some of that rent.  Patty, show us your vagina for $200.  That's right, Patty.  For a portable DVD player. 
[02:27:30]  For a portable DVD player and paying the rent, we want to see Patty's vagina.  As the curtains go down here in the Let's Make a Deal studios, Patty, all you have to do is stand up, drop your pants and panties, and show us that snatch, and this $200 will be yours.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  She's standing up.  Everyone's going to still respect me.  No.  We don't respect you now.  Anyway, Patty, if you could take your spot maybe a little further away from the console, stand up. 
[02:28:00]  There you go.  Move back.  Why is Ben covering his face?  Move back a little bit.  All right.  Look at the look on her face.  There you go.  Patty, drop those blue jeans you're wearing.  Patty.  Always.  Eyes on the prize, Patty.  Eyes on the prize.  $200.  Can I just.  That's a week's pay, Patty.  That's a week's pay.  You can't show your pants.  You can't show your pants.  It's just for $200.  It's just my panties. 
[02:28:30]  No.  No.  No, no, no.  Your panties have to come down.  You've got to flash us some vads.  Hold on.  No, no.  Yes.  A flash could be a half a second.  I mean, it's $200.  Yeah, she's got to show it.  It's got to be $1,000 to $1,000.  No, no, no.  I say 10 seconds.  We're not going to cut you.  10 seconds.  Oh, five.  Two seconds.  No, no, no.  Not two.  Anthony, put the $200 away.  We're done with the game.  All right.  Well, put the $200 away.  We're done with the game.  Look at those panties.  What the hell are those panties all about, Patty?  Jesus, we're scared.  You're scared.  Take the blue jeans down and show us the panties. 
[02:29:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  This is for 10 seconds.  You get $200.  Just the panties.  And your dream of owning a portable DVD player.  At first.  We want to work it with you.  At first.  We'll come work it down slow.  We're not going to cut you.  Just pull your jeans down.  It's like wearing a bathing suit.  Pull your jeans down.  It's like wearing a bathing suit.  See?  We're wearing a bathing suit.  There's nothing going on there.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Nice legs.  Yeah, nice legs.  Pull the jeans down further.  No, pull the jeans down further.  Patty, where'd you get those panties?  My, I got them.  I don't remember.  You don't remember where?  At a department store. 
[02:29:30]  At a department store.  All right.  They're not that bad.  Very sexy.  All right, Patty, this has to be for a count.  Opie has a timer.  Yes, I do.  You have an actual timer.  Where's the timer?  All right, my timer.  There's the actual timer.  This is not really me.  This is another person, okay?  I'm just associating myself.  Eyes on the prize, Patty.  Hold on, Eric, for 10 seconds.  Okay.  Well, as soon as we see Patch, I'll start the clock.  Pull him down as far as your pants go. 
[02:30:00]  Keep going.  For 10 seconds.  There you go.  Eight.  Seven.  Oh, my God.  Six.  Five.  Five.  You're counting down.  Four.  Keep him there.  Three.  Three meal at your restaurant.  Two.  One.  All right, we're done.  We did it.  We did it.  We're done.  There you go.  There, Patty.  Two more dollars.  Give Patty her $200. 
[02:30:30]  Patty, there you go.  There you go.  There you go, Patty.  Patty, here.  Patty, get your prize.  See how easy this game is?  $200.  Let me check the pile.  Now let's come along.  Now let's come along for looking.  Let's all count along at how much is left.  One, two, three, four.  There is $400 left.  And can I say for the record, below the waist, not bad.  Wow.  Not bad.  It hasn't been violated yet.  Of course not.  Coming from a sex addict, that means nothing.  Patty's sexy. 
[02:31:00]  She has nice eyes.  She takes care of herself.  Very good.  Very well-groomed, Patty.  Absolutely.  I notice you shave yourself down there.  Yeah, I do.  Get on, Mike.  Get on, Mike.  For hygiene.  For hygiene.  Yeah.  And what is hygiene?  Hey, this guy's got to get a plug for his restaurant again.  A real plug.  Oh, yeah.  The guy that, no, you, man.  I'm pointing at you.  The one that bought the name place.  Get a plug for your restaurant again.  Rivoli's Restaurant, 781 Fisher Boulevard, 732-270-3634. 
[02:31:30]  Homemade desserts all the time.  Italian food, right?  Italian food.  Huge portions.  Just say Opie and Anthony sent us, and you'll give him something.  Free appetizer.  Yes.  We're not done yet with Let's Make a Deal.  We still have $400 left, Patty.  $400, of which we have another $200, Patty, if you're willing to make a deal.  Patty, you want to play? 
[02:32:00]  Okay.  She says okay, everybody.  Yes.  Patty, another $200.  What would you now do with this $200?  You've already got your phone bill paid.  You have part of your rent paid.  You have that portable DVD player.  Now, another $200, Patty.  What would you do with this?  I'll read 10 pages of this.  No, I'm not talking about what you would do.  Believe me, we'll decide what you're going to do for the money. 
[02:32:30]  But what would you spend this on?  If we gave you another $200, what would you then buy with this?  Start a savings account.  Start a savings account.  Do you have a savings account already?  I just have a simple checking account.  Just a simple checking for a simple gown.  So you would then put this $200 in a savings account.  There isn't anything maybe you'd splurge a little.  You're talking about a portable DVD player, perhaps some DVDs maybe.  Maybe take a little bus ride down to Atlantic City. 
[02:33:00]  Atlantic City.  Parlay this into.  Or save it for next July, and when I get my vacation, when I get a free overnight stay,  all they do is pay $18 tax in the hotel because I have a comp card from Claridge.  You have a comp card from Claridge.  And you get a free night in the hotel?  Yeah, they give you free hotel.  Give me a pen.  I want to write to Anthony what I think.  Dude, we're on the same page, I'm sure. 
[02:33:30]  Go ahead.  How much for the bus ride?  That's $26.50, but you get $18 back.  So it's kind of fun.  $8.50?  $18, yeah.  Whatever.  Wow.  Yeah, that's round trip.  So it's really $4.25 each way.  And it's a nice ride down there, and they give you a movie on the bus sometimes.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She can do it from there.  Right, right, right.  And it's always a bus full of people over seven.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to start the music, and we're going to go back to our host. 
[02:34:00]  Welcome back to Let's Make a Deal.  Today we have Patty here in our studios, and she is now making a deal for $200.  $200.  Unbelievable.  Patty has already won a prize of $200 for showing her snatch, and a prize of $100 for simple flashing  of the booth, we now have an additional $200, which would make a grand total of $500. 
[02:34:30]  Go far.  Patty, you ready for this one?  What do we want you to do next?  I'm not sure, but go ahead.  It's very easy, Patty.  It requires a little physical energy, but not too much.  We want you to simply crawl from that end of the studio to this end of the studio.  That doesn't sound very difficult now, does it?  No.  All right, Patty, if you get on all fours over there in front of that wall, and we'll start  this.  Go ahead.  Get down there. 
[02:35:00]  Go ahead.  Get on all fours right there.  And oh, oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  And I forgot a slight detail about this.  See, you will have to crawl from that end of the studio to that.  Don't worry.  That seems to be what will earn you this $200.  But Patty, I forgot one small detail.  You have to do this completely naked.  Completely naked, Patty, for $200, a grand total of $500 on Let's Make a Deal, crawling 
[02:35:30]  completely nude from one end of the studio to the other.  I'm talking not a stitch of clothing.  Your shirt comes off, your panties come off, your pants come off, your socks, your shoes.  You are completely nude, crawling across the studio.  And your dream of a bus trip to Atlantic City will be realized.  Reality.  Your dream.  You'll be whisked away on Greyhound.  Greyhound bus.  The official bus line of Let's Make a Deal.  All right, wait.  Let's get Patty to the microphone.  What do you think of this?  Patty, if you could walk back to the microphone. 
[02:36:00]  I do have another twist in it, because I think you want to keep your identity to yourself,  right?  Yeah.  She's in shock.  She is stunned.  She's afraid of her face being seen.  Are you afraid of your face being seen, even though this is radio?  Yeah.  Are you going to pass out?  Are you all right?  It's a lot of money, Patty.  Take a seat.  We understand how excited.  You ever see people on Let's Make a Deal?  They jump up and down.  They get all excited.  We understand.  Take a seat there, Patty.  You've made a lot of money so far, and there's a lot more to make, and this is like a month's  pay for you.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Easily.  You all right?  Eric's fanning her.  I'm going to pass out.  No, sit down, Patty.  Sit down.  You have a choice.  You can either crawl naked or have Ricky get your food order.  I will suggest this.  Because, you know, to crawl...  Oh, my God.  What is that?  To crawl naked across the studio in front of a bunch of, you know, guys, I can understand  would be a little uncomfortable because everyone's looking at your face.  We will allow you to wear the Krusty mask. 
[02:37:00]  Big Krusty the Clown mask.  Here, try it on.  Let's...  Where's Eric?  Are you familiar with Krusty the Clown?  Yeah.  All right.  Try the mask on.  Okay.  All right.  Now, this could help.  Now, you're naked, but no one really knows it's you because you got the Krusty the Clown  mask on.  You've got to take her glasses off.  Yeah.  Eric, help her with the mask.  All right.  All right.  That looks nice.  You all right in there, Patty?  Yeah.  All right.  Put her on mic. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, get the mic next to her.  Now, Patty, this...  Now, you don't have to look at anyone.  You got the mask on.  You'll be naked.  You crawl across the studio.  You grab the $200 from Anthony, and then, yeah, you're a rich lady.  What do you think?  I think that should be worth $400.  Oh, she wants to make a deal.  No, we have another $200 up for grabs.  Yeah, $400.  Absolutely not.  All right.  I guess we're going to have to just put the money away for next time, Anthony.  Oh, that's a shame, Patty. 
[02:38:00]  Patty, it's up to you.  You have the mask on, so no one will know it's you.  $200, Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  The savings account.  Patty.  The bus trip to your free compa.  Stay at the Claridge.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  All right.  You want to...  All right.  Maybe we could put up a tarp or something.  She could get, like, naked behind the tarp with the mask on, and then when she's ready,  she'll say she's ready.  We'll drop the tarp, and she starts crawling.  Yeah, Patty, take the mask off.  Take the mask off.  Take the mask off. 
[02:38:30]  Okay.  How is that?  If we give you a tarp...  And don't wear your glasses.  Everything will look so blurry.  You won't be able to identify any of us.  Okay.  Oh, I like his hair.  Yeah, the crusty mask.  Yeah.  That's very nice.  All right.  We're getting some kind of a tarp thing.  Yeah.  And we'll be able to...  Like, almost an undressing room for you.  And then you'll say, when you're ready, we'll drop the tarp, and you start crawling.  We'll put the $200 down here at the end of the room.  You will crawl, grab it, and it's yours.  And then I think we need...  I think we need another tarp.  This is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to take care of Patty here. 
[02:39:00]  You're going to be behind the tarp.  You're going to get naked.  You say, I'm ready.  We drop the tarp.  You crawl naked across the studio.  On the other side will be somebody with a blanket or a towel to cover you up immediately.  Okay.  All right.  There we go.  She's a trooper.  Cover you with a blanket, and then we all walk over with bars of soap.  $200.  Ow.  Yeah, you guys could use a coat.  Someone needs a coat over there.  Not my coat.  All right.  The guys are trying to figure out how to make this happen, Anthony. 
[02:39:30]  Very good.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  What are you doing with those?  No.  I don't know.  Eric handed them poker chips.  Nah.  Don't worry, Patty.  I won't do that to you.  I'll put you guys in a case of apples.  You got apples, too?  I'll put you guys in a case of apples, too.  All right.  Nice.  Jimmy always complains about apples every morning.  I got some good ones.  Oh, thank you.  Crispy, crunchy apples.  Crispy, good apples.  We could do something with those apples for the last $200.  What do you do with the apples, though?  Eat them?  Oh, jeez. 
[02:40:00]  I was thinking somehow K.Y. has to be in front of us, too.  Oh, my God.  That's one up on the shelf.  Shh.  All right.  There's the tarp.  Oh.  It's like a little cardboard box.  We want her to keep her dignity, so someone has to be over there to cover up as soon as  this stun's done, and everyone's got to move out of the way.  Oh, as soon as this stunt's done.  I thought you were saying something bad about her.  Do you have, like, a...  She could use my coat or something.  I don't care. 
[02:40:30]  Just get anything to cover up when she's done.  Dude, Patty, on your...  All right, Patty.  On your coat.  You could...  In the corner over here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's going to be in the corner.  She's going to get naked.  Patty, then you're going to put the mask on.  Right.  And when you're ready, we'll drop the tarp, and then you start crawling to Anthony.  That'll have the $200 across the studio.  All right?  And Eric's got a coat.  So as soon as you're done, look, Patty, you know we don't lie to you.  As soon as you're done, we're even going to turn the lights down, because we know you're  a little uncomfortable.  As soon as you're done, Eric will have the coat to cover you up. 
[02:41:00]  All right?  And you'll be $200 richer.  All right.  All right.  She's back behind the cardboard, I guess.  She's...  She's disrobing.  I'm seeing, like, clothes.  It's like an old-time movie behind that blind where...  Well, let's start the music and set up the bid here, Anthony, like old-time TV.  Welcome back to Let's Make a Deal here in the Obi and Anthony studios.  Patty, right now, our contestant, was already won, I believe, $300 for various stunts she 
[02:41:30]  has done around the studio.  For $370.  $70.  Yes.  Well, we now have an additional $200 up for grabs.  All Patty has to do is crawl completely naked from one end of the studio to the other.  Right now, she is undressing behind our Let's Make a Deal backdrop.  And shortly, she will come out from behind that, crawl completely naked to the other end  of the studio, grab her $200, be covered in Opie's jacket.  Is that Opie's? 
[02:42:00]  It's Eric's.  It's Eric's own jacket.  We'll cover Patty.  And she will be $200 richer.  And we have an additional $200 for our last grand finale stunt.  That's right.  Which we are still conjuring up in our evil devilish minds.  Our sick, twisted minds.  Is Patty almost ready?  She wants to keep her socks on.  She wants to keep her socks on.  Yeah, that's fine.  That's good.  We don't want her catching any diseases.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  All right. 
[02:42:30]  Well, all right, Anthony, I got a bird's eye view.  I'm very high up in the studio right now.  All right, Eric, if you could put that down right there.  Against the wall.  Against the wall.  Move the lamp.  There it is.  The money is now in place here at the opposite end of the studio.  Patty, are you undressed?  Patty is completely nude.  Hold on, Anthony.  One last twist.  Hey, guys, do you want to see this?  Come on in.  We can't open the door.  Wait, wait. 
[02:43:00]  No, they can see from there.  No, let them come in.  They're going to get the best view.  Let them come in.  Let them come in.  Just put the shade up real quick.  Yeah, let them come in.  Hold on.  You're going to hit it with the door.  Hold on.  Well, just Patty, move back a second.  You are evil.  Just the last twist.  Does she have the Krusty the clown mask on?  Yes, she does.  We got all the interns making their way into the studio.  We got Than.  We got Travis.  We got Ricky.  Don't stand where she's crawling.  And Danny has decided not to come in, and Derek has to stay in the other booth. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  Is Ben coming in?  Get Ben.  Yeah, I noticed Master Poe is nowhere to be seen because it's her.  Where is he?  No, yeah.  It's hot in here.  Watch out.  He's going to barge open the door and hit her right in the Krusty the clown head.  All right.  That's it.  You're either coming in or not.  This is it.  All right.  Now, Pat from Munaki, you're too big to fit through the door.  No, no Pat from Munaki.  Pat from Munaki will be doing the news in the next segment, Anthony.  All right.  Shut the door.  All right.  End of the people coming in.  All right.  Here we go, Pat.  All right. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, my gosh.  Ready?  They didn't crawl fast either.  For $200.  Yeah, don't hurt your knees or nothing.  Do it slow.  Just yell, you're ready.  Ready.  All right.  All right.  And go.  There she is.  Completely naked.  Patty is crawling.  Completely naked.  Totally nude.  In the Krusty the clown mask.  In the Krusty mask.  She has got the money.  Patty is $200 richer.  Wow, Patty.  What people will do for money. 
[02:44:30]  What a great job.  No, she's walking back.  She can't see where she's walking because she's got the Krusty the clown back on.  Take the Krusty mask off of her head.  We might as well keep her naked for the last $200.  Oh, Jesus.  Anyone want to attempt to describe what we just saw?  Disgusting.  Not bad.  It's only the radio.  Shut up.  Not bad, actually.  Her cheeks are more impressive than I thought they'd be.  Really?  I actually got like a little...  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy. 
[02:45:00]  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Don't get excited at that.  Stop it.  Not bad.  He's holding himself and he's actually packing.  Wow.  That was...  Yeah, that was Patty completely nude crawling across the studio with the Krusty the clown mask on.  Yeah.  We're going to have to show that on Foundry Music, man.  No.  There's no...  No, we won't.  Don't worry.  But there's no private parts that were filmed, Patty.  All you see is like the...  Right?  Because you were in front of her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Danny?  Everything's fine, Patty.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  Well, Patty's getting her clothes back on and dressed. 
[02:45:30]  But she shouldn't, right?  We do have one more prize.  See, we should have made the last $300, $400.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could have had her suck a couple.  And there she is, completely clothed again.  Let's hear it for Patty.  What a fantastic job she's done here.  So far, she's $570 richer than she was when she came in the studio.  What's the recap, Anthony?  What did she do for each one?  She flashed just for $100. 
[02:46:00]  Flashed for $100.  She got $70 right off the bat just for supplying the prizes, for supplying the plaques.  And then she got $100 for flashing.  She got $200 for showing her vag for 10 seconds.  That was the 20-second 10 seconds.  And then this past $200, you just heard here live on Let's Make a Deal, was Patty totally  naked, crawling across the studio for $200.  We have our last prize of $200 up for grabs now. 
[02:46:30]  And I don't know.  I'm just looking up at our supplies.  Our supplies up top.  And I'm seeing some KY.  I'm seeing gloves.  Patty, how do you feel?  Oh, very funny.  Yeah?  I think I'm ready for my 50th birthday, and I just lost my barrette.  It just fell out of my hair.  Your barrette?  A barrette came out of her hair.  A barrette.  Oh, it's only a barrette. 
[02:47:00]  All right, get your headphones back on.  A barrette.  So, Patty, you're $570 richer.  How much do you make a week at Godiva after taxes?  And also 5% more in deductions, because I pay for my own health insurance, about $220 maybe.  $220 a week.  After taxes.  $200 maybe, after taxes.  So, you've made almost the equivalent of three weeks' pay in less than a half hour.  See how easy it is?  Yeah.  It is easy, though, right? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  A little bit of clothes getting thrown off of you.  And the money comes rolling in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  $200 left.  We have $200 left.  $200.  $200 left.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Do I got to be the guy?  Yeah.  Well, what do you want?  Patty, you are indeed a virgin, are you not?  Do you? 
[02:48:00]  Now, this is...  Oh, no.  I'm not going to give up my virginity on the air.  I draw the line.  For $200?  Of course, I'm not.  I cannot do that.  No.  We have a black gentleman.  No one was going to ask you.  I was going to ask you to give up your virginity.  Don't worry.  Now, is this just...  We're talking about inanimate objects.  Relax.  Is this just a man that you have not slept with, as far as virginity goes?  Or have you pleasured yourself at all?  Have you done that?  Well, you're not supposed to do stuff like that. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  It's evil, nasty, and filthy, as far as the Catholic Church goes.  I don't know.  Some kind of, like, selfishness or something.  I don't know.  That's what I was taught growing up.  Selfishness?  Who taught you that?  That's not a bad idea.  Eric's got a pretty good idea.  The nuns at the foundling.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Well, what do you want me to do?  Oh, what a trooper.  Isn't she a trooper, folks?  We're just...  We're mulling this over. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  We're just trying to think of something.  Is anything good on the instant feedback?  We're thinking maybe something to do with Pat's...  Toe.  Toe.  Oh, no.  I don't want to put somebody's ilky toe in my mouth.  Yuck.  My mouth?  No.  Who said anything about a mouth, Patty?  I'm just guessing.  Yeah.  Let's see.  We have all instant feedbacks coming in like crazy.  I'm a germaphobe.  Two words.  Drill dough. 
[02:49:30]  What do we got?  A lot of people saying wiffle bat.  No.  No.  How about not in the front, the wiffle bat?  No.  No.  No.  We could maybe...  We could go old school and hide the 200 in the front of someone's pants and then line  everyone up and...  Who's going to do that?  I would.  Jimmy's in.  Anybody else?  No?  Danny's in.  Wait.  Explain to everybody.  Basically, she'd have like five guys lined up and she has to keep, you know, reaching 
[02:50:00]  into pants until she gets in.  And searching inside until you find the $200.  Yeah.  Oh.  Like another Ron Jeremy.  Right.  She kind of did that, though.  Yeah.  I don't think he would remember me, though.  Oh, yeah.  He would.  Oh, he wouldn't.  He would.  Yeah.  He would.  Oh, my.  Let's see.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Anybody?  Bueller?  Anyone?  Anyone?  I'm thinking...  I'm thinking the glove, the KY, and making a couple of fingers disappear. 
[02:50:30]  No!  No!  All right.  That's the deal?  No.  That's the bet.  All right.  Well, I don't want anyone to touch me.  No, it wouldn't be anyone.  It would be you.  You would put the gloves on.  You would then rub KY on your fingers, and then you have to make one finger per $100 bill.  Why?  So if you get both fingers in there, it's $200. 
[02:51:00]  And we're talking up to the middle knuckle.  Up to the middle knuckle.  That's not bad.  Oh, my God.  And then tickle your own G-spot.  Why does she have to put gloves on?  It's her.  Well, I don't know.  To make it clinical.  Yeah.  It's not as sexy.  Or, Patty, we can play Cherry Darn.  Very literally, actually.  Yeah.  Patty, it's either that, or you pull your pants down and show your butt, and we throw cherries at your butthole. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  I like the cherries better.  You want to do cherry darts?  Yeah.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, cherry darts for Let's Make a Deal.  Fantastic.  This is awful.  I know.  Ben's having a heart attack.  Get the mask on.  Oh, my goodness.  You have to have the mask on, I think, right?  So no one can see your face?  You want the mask on so no one can see your face? 
[02:52:00]  I'm not going to be facing the wall anyway, right?  She's very good at this, yeah.  You will be.  You will be facing the wall.  Yeah.  And this is good, because we could all be involved.  That's right.  Oh.  Yeah, but we should have some kind of side thing.  We can't just throw darts.  Ah.  You mean a side bet for us?  Yeah.  Whoever gets the closest?  Yeah, like whoever, whichever one of us gets the closest. 
[02:52:30]  Ah.  Hmm.  This is really degraded, hasn't it?  Just awful.  This is embarrassing.  This is taking an awful turn, this show, today.  Well, um.  Yeah, you people asked for it.  Why don't we, should we take, hey, get back to what you used to do.  Oh, here it is.  This is it.  Hope you enjoy it.  Should we take a break and regroup here?  All you guys do is read the news these days and play audio clips and comment on them.  Why don't you make the show like you used to be? 
[02:53:00]  You got it, asshole.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Straight from the WNEW studios.  Yeah, with the Virgin Mary at that.  That's what they used to call me.  Really?  Hey, so Patty, you're going to get completely naked.  You're going to lean up against the lesbian couch and we're going to throw cherry darts?  Yep.  Well, not completely naked.  What are you going to do?  Because you're only going to aim in one area.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, she could just rip her pants down.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't want her to get naked again.  All right, well, why don't we take a break? 
[02:53:30]  Let's get all the guys in here to set up the studio for cherry darts.  Cool.  All right.  May I have tissue?  It's got my nose.  Your nose is a little runny?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You all right there, Patty?  Yeah.  All right.  Are you still lightheaded?  Yeah.  Well, I've never done stuff like this in my life.  No, no, we know that.  Yeah, this is almost prostitution, by the way.  This is breaking. 
[02:54:00]  She's a virgin.  She won't let anyone touch her or do anything to her, but there you go.  Are you sure you don't want to do the glove thing?  No.  No?  No.  Why?  I might injure myself and stuff.  I don't think so.  With a finger and a glove and KY and, oh, well.  All right, Patty.  Well, we'll take a break, and when we get back, it's Cherry Darts with Stalker Patty.  Wow.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Easy Rider is not a porno magazine, you idiotic school. 
[02:54:30]  It's a biker magazine.  They throw some skanks in there for the fucking lowlife like you, who had nothing better to feed off to, so you'd pick up anything.  And don't lie.  And don't lie.  You whacked your back to it.  Punch it out.  Yeah, I'd like to put out a big fuck you to Jay Moore.  He was on AAF a couple weeks ago at 8 o'clock in the morning, so he can fucking get up for them fucking dickheads.  Fuck you, Jay Moore, you homo.  Yeah, I'd like to send out a big F-U to my brother-in-law, Herbie, who graciously offered to buy tickets for the fucking Norton show and called an hour before saying he didn't feel good and canceled the tickets to the fucking sold-out show. 
[02:55:00]  F-U, Herbie.  Fuck you, Jamie.  Pull your head out of your fucking ass and try listening to something different than fucking Fox News.  I'd like to say a special fuck you to all you little furrows out there.  but don't know how to drive around a state truck.  Fuck you. 
[02:55:30]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. & Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE1.  1-866-FU-LINE1.  Well, fuck you very much.  I'll tell you what I like about Chinese people.  As long as we're on the subject. 
[02:56:00]  They're hanging in there with those chopsticks.  Still using chopsticks.  You know they've seen the fork.  Oh, they're well aware that we have the fork.  And the spoon.  I don't know how they missed it.  Chinese farmer getting up working in the field with a shovel all day.  Hello, shovel. There it is.  You're not plowing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.  I'm sorry, was that homophobic? 
[02:56:30]  No. I think it was.  Because I hear that a lot.  Dave, what? You're talking about being gay.  You probably secretly are gay.  And I'm like, listen, voice in my head.  I'm not.  How do you know you wouldn't like it?  How do you know you wouldn't like it?  I know I wouldn't like it.  Other scarier voice in my head.  Because one time while making a sandwich, 
[02:57:00]  a cucumber went up my ass.  Three times.  If that ever happens, you need two things and two things quick.  A pair of ice tongs and a friend who can keep a secret.  Preferably your midget friend.  Because no one believes a midget until it's too late. 
[02:57:30]  They're just too cute.  They get excited, start jumping up and down.  You think they're telling you a riddle or something.  What?  Cucumber up a man's ass?  Is that where the treasure is?  Well, then lead me into your midget world.  The virus is out.  I repeat, the virus is out.  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report. 
[02:58:00]  I'm Chuck Devine.  And there's deep powder skiing for President's Weekend in the western United States from the Rockies all the way to California.  We'll start out at Breckenridge.  They've got another 10 inches of brand new snow.  That's 20 inches over the past couple of days.  So you will have knee-deep and waist-deep snow and fresh tracks, too, for them and for Aspen.  The Canyons and Deer Valley in Utah, well over a foot and a half of snow over the past few days. 
[02:58:30]  So they're in great shape, too.  Timberline, Oregon is skiing from six different lifts, so things have improved there.  Squaw Valley, California got snow every day this week.  That's over 300 inches for the whole year.  Powder skiing on some trails and extensive grooming on others.  Snowshoe Mountain, West Virginia, with more than 50 well-groomed trails of loose and frozen granulars.  Seven Springs, Pennsylvania is 100%.  Sunday River, Maine, with three feet of snow the past week and 48 miles of pack powder on eight mountains. 
[02:59:00]  I'm Chuck Devine with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  It's building.  NASCAR Acceleration 2005, now playing at Daytona International Speedway.  Daytona International Speedway.  And your XM gets you access to all the races, all the NASCAR news, over 100 hours of Speed Week's coverage.  Finishing off with the great American race, the Daytona 500.  NASCAR Acceleration 2005, now playing on the exclusive satellite radio service of NASCAR. 
[02:59:30]  XL 144.  Opie and Anthony on high-voltage XM 202.  XM news, talk, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  You wanted nudity?  We give you nudity. 
[03:00:00]  The O&A virus spreading across America.  That's right.  One of our goofy Friday shows.  We got Stalker Patty in the studio.  So far, she has won $570, Anthony.  Nice.  By playing our version of Let's Make a Deal.  Yeah.  So, for the final $200, let me start up the music here, and we'll explain what's going on,  just in case people are tuning in for the first time.  Let's Make a Deal.  Well, so far, Patty has won $570 in cash, and she's going to use it to pay some of the rent, 
[03:00:30]  buy that portable DVD player, and open up a savings account, and a bus trip to Atlantic City.  Wow.  What is she going to do with the last $200?  Patty, $200.  Put it away in case I have an emergency.  Ah, an emergency.  All right.  Well, she really knows how to spend that money.  And this last $200, of course, she is going to earn by kneeling on the lesbian couch with her butt facing us. 
[03:01:00]  We will then throw cherry darts at her, bung, and try to get a bullseye.  And that will get her the last $200 that we have for a grand total of $770.  What's in it for us?  Absolutely nothing.  Jesus.  We are just doing this for our fans, Opie.  All right, Patty, assume the position.  We got the cherries.  We got the whipped cream.  Oh, fuck.  We got to open the cheeks. 
[03:01:30]  We can't get it in that way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give her the microphone.  Why does her pants have to come down to this?  She can't get in the right position that way.  Yeah, Patty, you're going to have to lose the pants, unfortunately.  And the socks.  Believe me, we don't want to ask for that, but you have to.  You can keep the socks on, but yeah.  Can't she just pull them down to her ankles?  No, because it won't hurt her.  Yeah, she needs to kind of spread her, uh...  Yeah.  All right.  I want to see it winking back at me.  Oh, my God.  You can't aim the cherry dart at the cheek. 
[03:02:00]  Right.  So you have to just gently, gently just separate the cheeks.  That's where the cherry dart gets thrown.  That's how it sticks.  Yeah.  All right.  Patty, have you lost the jeans?  What?  I've got to take my shoes off first.  All right.  Jesus.  Give me a second.  No problem.  We'll give you a second.  Still to come on the show, Pat from Menachie doing the news again.  Oh, yeah.  What are you...  Can I do a cherry dart? 
[03:02:30]  I can't eat cherries.  I'll lose another toe.  Throw my toes that have been cut off at my ass.  Oh, there she goes.  How comfy she's getting being naked now.  I know.  Naughty, naughty Patty.  Oh, not really comfortable at all.  Naughty, naughty girl you are.  Stand on the floor.  What are you doing?  Yeah, lean all the way.  You know, lean like the girl on page 77 of Hustler Magazine.  Now, you've got to pull your shirt up a little bit so we don't get cherries on your back.  Okay.  Just go to another place, Patty. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Go to another place.  You're back at the foundling center.  You can take a shower in the Opie and Anthony shower after you're done.  Where is that?  And wash away the filth.  Yeah, you're going to have to wipe.  I'm not like that.  All right, well.  This isn't me.  Why isn't anyone jumping up to get in position to throw darts?  How many of us are throwing the darts?  Well, go ahead, Jimmy.  Oh, of course.  Give one a throw.  Line up.  You've got to pick a cherry out.  Ooh, they're cold.  Oh, they are.  Get that whipped cream on there.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to try to get over here. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, God.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Jimmy is setting up the cherry.  Hold on.  Keeping the stem, are you?  Always.  Always keeps the stem.  We really loaded up with whipped cream on that one.  Anthony, the target's still covered, Anthony.  Patty, I can't.  How am I supposed to?  You have to spread your cheeks so I can get it in there.  I don't think I've had to do that.  No, no, no.  You don't stand on the floor.  Stay kneeling.  Reach back with your hands.  You have to open your cheeks so I can throw the cherry dart in.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm very close. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, yeah.  That's perfect.  Perfect.  Oh, God.  Oh, you missed.  I actually had it on target.  The cherry diverted.  All right.  I, uh...  Anthony, you're going to go?  Oh, God.  Hold on.  You've got to open it.  How are you going to get a cherry in there?  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Patty, you've got to stick that butt up in the air a little bit more.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No, my God. 
[03:04:30]  No, my God.  No, Eric, you've got to get back.  Don't go near her.  Don't go that close to her.  Wait.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ow.  She puckered.  I felt that.  I hit it just to the right.  All right.  I think I got it just to the right.  Just to the right of ground zero.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Ope.  Opey lining up.  What about Sparks?  Ben Sparks?  Yeah.  He will never.  He will never do it.  Anybody else put in?  Ben is not.  Ben doesn't find this fun at all.  Oh, God.  No. 
[03:05:00]  No.  Yeah.  Ben hates this.  Ew.  Almost.  Oh, my God.  I hate sticky.  You've got to open them.  Opey, just open.  Yes.  Spread them.  Open them.  You've got to open them.  There you go.  Why?  No, Patty, open them.  He can't get in there.  Opey's going for a kneeling approach.  There you go.  Opey's kneeling to get right on level.  There you go.  Oh.  He slammed into the right butt cheek.  Yeah.  How about the guy that gave us the money?  Sure.  Cool. 
[03:05:30]  Why shouldn't he have a shot?  You get in there.  Make sure you supply Patty with paper towels so she can go to work.  Our friend from Rivoli's in Tom River.  Or Revelle's, right?  Revelle's.  Revelle's in Tom River.  There he goes.  He's loading up with some cool whip on that cherry.  Taking position.  No.  I'm embarrassed.  Patty, you've got to spread that open.  Open them.  Yeah.  There you go.  Push back.  Oh.  Another one on the right cheek, Anthony.  Upper right cheek.  Wow.  Everything's pulling off to the right.  I think Hawk needs to go. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  Opey's having problems with his microphone.  Yeah.  Oh, there it goes.  Going back in.  There you go.  Hold on.  Hawk.  Go in there and grab a nice cherry dart.  Patty, you've got to reach back.  Oh.  What happened there?  You've got to put your hands by the hole.  Oh.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, wow.  You've got to spread them.  Yeah, spread them open.  And stick the butt up in the air.  Push it back a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Nice arch.  That's called the penthouse position.  There you go.  Wow, there's a lot of whipped cream on that one. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, I'm anything but penthouse.  Oh.  Very close.  Just short.  Somebody won.  Again, the right cheek.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, dip that.  That's a good point, Danny.  Let's dip that apple in whipped cream.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Two apples.  Eric was the closest so far.  Let's see what else we can do.  All right.  Keep them open while we tally the vote.  How many more to go so I can end this?  A couple more.  We're just.  But first, we got to, we should get, I wonder if we should get Pat in here just to do the  news?  No.  We're just.  No.  I got to, I got to go to work. 
[03:07:00]  I got to go.  Wow.  I hope your bosses don't ever see this video online.  None of them have accents, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank God for that, right?  Yeah.  We wouldn't want to call them and tell them to go to Pat for Music.  No, no, no.  I think we've.  Don't do that to Patty.  I think we've done a great job.  Would you give Patty a paper towel?  Yes.  And let her wipe down?  You got something to spray on her?  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.  Stalker Patty.  She's now cleaning up.  She has won the final $200. 
[03:07:30]  Look at her wiping.  That's nice.  Grand total, $770.  Won today by Patty on Let's Make a Deal.  Very good, Patty.  Isn't that amazing how we parlayed this?  None of it our money.  It was actually her money from the start.  It was just going to be given to her.  And we actually parlayed it into her getting the money we were going to give her anyway.  Give her that microphone, Dan.  I know it wasn't going to be that easy. 
[03:08:00]  Patty, do you realize we were just going to give you that money?  Oh, but I know it wasn't going to be that easy.  No.  That would make it fun.  Yeah, but before you came in, it was just going to be that easy.  We had no plans of doing this today.  We were just going to hand you over the money.  But, you know, sickos like us just figured maybe you'd want to earn it.  I don't think you'd respect yourself if you just took the money.  $770. 
[03:08:30]  Look, now you earned it.  It's not like charity.  Patty, you got like two bowling ball holes back there.  What?  They're just very small.  Very small?  Well, they haven't been used for anything.  They're...  She probably takes like little rabbit dumps.  There's like six little pellets when she walks.  You're like my cat.  You want to present Patty with this, Jimmy?  There you go.  All right.  The last $200.  There you go, Patty. 
[03:09:00]  Patty, this last $200 is for kneeling on the couch and opening your asshole so we can throw fruit at it.  When you put it like that.  All right.  Wow, Patty.  We could get the shades back up, get some sunlight back in the studio.  Yeah.  You block all sunlight.  This is great.  Get my dignity back.  Patty, congratulations.  What's happening?  That's on a bus to Atlantic City.  You just won $770.  That's huge for you.  Yeah.  That's over three weeks' pay.  Congratulations.  Want to thank the guy from the restaurant.  The restaurant again, sir. 
[03:09:30]  No, get on the mic there, sweetie.  Get the nice plug in.  Rivoli's Restaurant, Toms River, New Jersey.  781 Fisher Boulevard, 732-270-3634.  Big portions Italian food.  Yeah, looking for a place to eat and you're in the area.  You know, go say hi to those guys and tell them Opie and Anthony sent you, okay?  All right.  Patty, get to work.  There you go, Patty.  Thanks, Patty.  Off to work.  You go.  Thanks for you, bro.  Her ass smelling like souring whipped cream throughout the day, I'm sure.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  There you go.  You got your money.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah.  Put your shoes on. 
[03:10:00]  All right.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Carl in Jersey.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  All right.  So, I've been listening to you guys since any W, and I've got to tell you, boy, this  bit has taken a turn.  Oh.  For the good?  It was good, but it's not any W style, boy.  Oh, that's all right.  Yeah, unfortunately, I have a nice one.  I have no idea what he meant by that, but we had fun playing Let's Make a Deal with Patty.  Of course we did.  All right, Patty. 
[03:10:30]  We'll see you soon.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  There she goes, Patty.  Patty, Patty.  Leave in the studio.  Practicing good hygiene.  Look at her.  She's waiting now.  What?  Bye-bye.  All right.  Let's get Pat from Munaki into the studio.  You want to open up a...  The grand finale was a little lame, but it was just horrific.  It was horrific.  Yeah, it was good.  Cherry darts.  Yeah.  What was your favorite?  Mine was the crawling across the floor naked with the huge, crusty mask on. 
[03:11:00]  Of course.  Of course.  That was something.  Hey, Pat.  Hold on.  Let me get your mic on.  Pat from Munaki is doing the news today on the program, Anthony.  Yes.  Hey.  Ah, let some sunlight in here.  What's my news chair?  We're getting your news chair.  News chair.  Pat, you just got to...  When Pat sits there, it's a snooze chair.  Well, he needs to sit down.  You towed me.  You towed me.  Hey, we haven't had news on the program in a while.  All right. 
[03:11:30]  We're getting...  We're getting...  Hey, Norton, want to get under me?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jeez.  Also, there's a new Ramon...  I'm bombing like a tow missile.  Wow.  Fog setting in on the Autobahn.  This is just...  This, Justin, Anthony, there's a new Ramon promo.  There is.  Stop.  A new Ramon promo.  All right.  All right.  Well, yeah, Pat's in studio to do the news for us today. 
[03:12:00]  And you worked on some more stories?  Yeah.  Yeah, a couple little things there.  All right.  Are you just about ready, or...?  Just about ready, yeah.  If we...  I wish this was TV.  If you could see the bumbling he's doing.  There's no other way to put that but bumbling.  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  Wow, it kind of sounds like it.  It really did.  That was really good.  He's, like, shuffling papers and very uncomfortable. 
[03:12:30]  Can you do the whole speech about, oh, Howard!  That was great.  I have a long way to go to get the hack.  Do the whole speech from Planes, Trains, and Automobile about, you know, go ahead, hurt  me if you have to.  You know that one?  I don't know that one.  He doesn't know that one.  Which one do you know?  I know the...  Those aren't pillows.  Yeah, but that's Steve Martin.  Yeah, but it was funny. 
[03:13:00]  John Candy's line was, why are you holding my hand?  Why are you holding my hand?  Yeah, that's true, though.  That is the line.  You know, if Pat doesn't screw up here, Pat is probably going to be in the lead.  Listeners love Pat today.  Meeting out Club Soda Kenny on the news.  Really?  I think so.  Pretty good response to Pat.  That's great.  I'm big, fat, and stupid.  Paralyzed, too.  What?  Hold it.  The guy wasn't kidding.  He gave us a carton of apples. 
[03:13:30]  A case of Washington apples.  There has to be at least 200 apples in there.  Wow.  How many apples are in there, seriously?  A hundred?  Crisp.  Interns, listen.  This is apple fingers.  Ricky.  Oh, that makes a nice sound.  You know it's tight.  That's like a skull.  All right.  Very good.  Okay, I guess we're ready for the news with Pat from Monaki.  All righty.  If we'll start the teletype here, you can start, Pat. 
[03:14:00]  And now the news with Pat from Monaki.  Pat.  Thanks, Ant.  Do you want to do the news?  Hey, it's your job.  Okay.  Why don't you try it?  Okay.  Brittany.  Angry over honeymoon photos.  Photos of Spears and her new husband, Kevin.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Nothing your fault there, but should that really be teletype, or maybe do we have any 
[03:14:30]  da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, maybe entertainment tonight type of music, because  that's, you know, celebrity gossip kind of, that entertainment news.  I did the hard news before.  Yeah, that was the teletype, the type of writers.  Teletype.  All right, let me go to the phones real fast as we get that music for you, Anthony.  Joe from Delaware.  Go ahead, Joe. 
[03:15:00]  Joe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Joe.  Oh, hold on.  Sorry about that.  Self-connection bet.  I wanted to ask Pat if he would go into a bathroom stall with Jose Canseco and let him  shoot insulin into his ass.  Insulin?  Uh, yeah.  Perfect.  Wow.  Sorry about that, guys.  All right.  That's what I called.  And now, entertainment news.  You see, you've got to have more fun delivered. 
[03:15:30]  And now, the entertainment news with Pat from Mundaki.  Hey!  Brittany Anger over honeymoon photos.  Photos of Spears and her new husband, Kevin Federline, are on the cover of Us Weekly  magazine.  Us Weekly.  Shut up.  It's an American magazine.  It's on the one thing.  Hey, I'm Blubber.  You're glue.  Uh, anyway, the picture was on the cover of the magazine, Us Weekly, with headline, Britney's 
[03:16:00]  private album.  Uh, Spears quickly issued a statement condemning the use of the photographs, which she said  had been taken by hotel staff.  Pictures of the star's honeymoon October in the Fiji Islands are displayed on five pages  inside the magazine, showing the happy couple relaxing and enjoying breakfast on the beach.  Kevin and I, Kevin and I chose a resort location where we were promised absolute privacy and 
[03:16:30]  seclusion, the 23-year-old pop star said.  Unfortunately, staff members took photographs of us, which we allowed them to take once we  were assured that they were being taken only for private use in a scrapbook that they gave  us as a souvenir.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I'd scrap to that book.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  My penis is broken.  Uh, other magazines, including Star, contacted us when presented with these photographs and 
[03:17:00]  refused to publish them, said Spears.  Kevin and I thanked those magazines for respecting our rights of privacy.  Us Weekly said in a statement, coming from a celebrity who sold pictures of both her wedding  and her stepdaughter is unlikely to issue...  What?  Is unlikely the issue here is privacy.  Uh, I can't read.  Because I'm big, fat, and stupid.  Patty reads better.  Ow.  Patty from Munaki. 
[03:17:30]  No, that's me after a sex change.  Could it be that Britney is seeing red after not seeing the green from these photos?  Britney Spears should start a magazine if she'd like to dictate her own coverage.  All right.  I hope every story's not that long.  Yeah.  That's my self-deprecating humor.  Editing.  Work on it.  Yeah, you need...  A little editing.  If you're going to get this job, you need to edit a little bit.  What were you doing out there?  I lost my highlighter.  I had to read everything.  Uh, I have self-deprecating humor. 
[03:18:00]  I shit myself.  Oh, no, that's self-defecating humor.  Oh, no, I got to read rest to that.  I'm going to start my own, uh, liquor company.  It's going to be Toquila.  It's very rare.  There will only be nine bottles.  Wouldn't it be ten?  He lost a toe.  No, I can't count.  Remember yesterday?  He can't find the one toe he lost already.  Yeah.  But he already has it.  I figured he could use that and the other toes. 
[03:18:30]  No, that was the treat for my dogs when I got home.  Oh!  Toquila.  Hey, you know what Patty says to Gene Simmons?  Huh?  Hi, Gene.  Ha, ha, ha.  Hmm.  Rachel, can you at least act like I'm funny?  Like you think I'm funny.  Oops.  Ruin that one.  And now for the weather.  The weather?  You were out there for an hour and a half.  That's all you got from it.  Hold on.  I do the weather in the middle of my broadcast.  Oh. 
[03:19:00]  See, I'm edgy and different.  Let me check on the weather.  Oh, let's look out the window.  Whoa, it looks like rain out there.  That's my honeymooner's reference.  It certainly looks like a rain tonight.  Yeah.  Hey, Norton, sleepwalking.  No, there you go.  Okay.  Never mind.  Well, that was a good episode.  All right.  Hey, Patty was playing Let's Make a Deal.  I'm not picking the box.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh.  Uh. 
[03:19:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Wow.  Uh.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We have a sponsor for this segment.  Let's go for Pete.  Hey, Pete.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Pete.  This segment of the O.P. and Anthony Show is brought to you by Geico.  Oh.  Thank you, Pete.  All right.  Go ahead.  Continue, Pat.  Okay.  Uh.  Hot 97.  Set to axe.  A-wall.  Miss Info. 
[03:20:00]  Miss Info.  The only member of radio station WQHT's morning team who wasn't suspended or terminated over  the ill-advised tsunami song says the station has warned her she may be fired today if she  doesn't return to the show, where her attorney says she can no longer comfortably work.  Attorney Ken Thompson said yesterday that Miss Info, whose real name is Minya O, and I saw  a picture of her, ooh, I chink I'm in love, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, 
[03:20:30]  And Miss Jones said, you think you're superior because you're Asian. 
[03:21:00]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, no.  Oh, said the station has also forbidden here.  If she returns to talk on air about the Tsunami song,  we are the world parody that used racial slurs.  Punctuation?  Who needs them?  There's a couple hyphens in there.  Uh, I feel I owe that to the listeners said, oh.  Whenever I see said, oh, is it said, oh. 
[03:21:30]  Anyway.  Oh, oh.  There we go.  I'm dice, oh.  Hey, call that chink over here.  Oh.  What?  And she's like, do I know you?  Online at the bank.  Oh.  Oh.  Uh.  Okay.  Said, oh, who did the celebrity drama gossip segment on the morning show. 
[03:22:00]  This is a huge thing.  She must have been looking at my cack.  Uh, the world is watching.  I can't go back on if I can't address what happened.  WQOHT yesterday said it would love to have Miss Info back,  but we haven't been able to get an answer on whether she's coming back.  How could there be so many words on that little piece of paper he's holding?  You're killing us.  He's holding a tiny piece of paper, and it's going on forever.  Thompson.  Maybe it just looks small in his hands.  Man, get back to the news, Anthony. 
[03:22:30]  It's probably a full-size newspaper I'm looking at.  All right, and back to the news.  Harry.  All right.  I'm attacking a 50-foot woman.  Yes.  Uh, Thompson said WQHT had offered, oh, several alternative slots,  including a weekend entertainment segment,  but he called them unacceptable demotions.  All right.  Everything you want to know about that situation.  Very good.  I do sports scores, but the only scores I do is on 60th Street. 
[03:23:00]  What?  It's awful.  You know scores, 60th?  Yeah.  Scores.  Jimmy just goes, oh, New York strip club, 60th Street.  We got it, yeah.  Ex-apprentice says Trump's a sexist.  Donald Trump, a male chauvinist pig,  terminated apprentice contestant Kirsten Kirshner says so.  He disrespects women, the 32-year-old Los Angeles financier insists to Us magazine. 
[03:23:30]  He likes them weak.  If you use your brain, you won't stay in the game.  Trump just couldn't handle a woman who speaks her mind.  If the abrasive Kirshner sounds bitter, I can't...  My heart is slowing down here.  Trump just couldn't handle...  Now it's funny.  Don't go across that.  That's a good one.  If the abrasive Kirshner sounds bitter, I can't blame her. 
[03:24:00]  She got fired, Trump told me yesterday, a few hours after his longtime lieutenant...  Lieutenant...  You are a disgusting fat body, Private Kyle!  Norma Federer seethed at Kirshner's allegation.  Norma's far more outraged than I am.  We're done with that story.  Move on.  You little scumbag!  That was good.  I got your name!  I got your ass!  How many more stories you got? 
[03:24:30]  Hopefully the answer is none.  I got hot teen news.  Where is that Private Kyle?  Sir, Jelly Donuts, sir!  Wait, you got hot...  It's eggnog, sir!  All right, hold on.  You got hot teen news?  Yes.  All right, hold on.  We'll give you the hot teen news...  Hold on here.  All right.  Opie and Anthony's hot teen news.  A former Westchester teacher who's convinced you for having sex with underage students was overturned after she served three years behind bars is now free. 
[03:25:00]  Get your cock out, kids!  Ha ha ha!  Get the neck brace out, guys!  Marcy Stein, 33, pleaded guilty Wednesday to endangering the welfare of a child and was sentenced to a year.  She admitted having inappropriate physical contact with three boys but denied sexual contact.  Stein was convicted in August 2001 of having sex with three boys, ages 14 and 16, from her special education classes at Hendrickson Hudson High School in Montrose. 
[03:25:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Three retards.  Yeah!  And one was made packed.  Oh, yeah.  During the trial, the youngest boy testified that Wood Stein wooed him to her Buchanan home.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  Uh, performed oral sex on him and then let him watch why she masturbated with a purple vibrator.  Ah, that pretty. 
[03:26:00]  Was Prince in the room?  No.  Oh!  Maybe it was Donny Osmond.  No!  Purple socks?  No, never mind.  Purple socks?  Purple socks!  Ah!  Oh, wow.  Uh, she began her 12-year sentence for statutory rape and related charges in November 2001.  Hmm.  And that's the hot teen news.  Oh.  And hopefully that's the end of the newscast.  Uh, yeah.  You got more? 
[03:26:30]  What do you got there?  Uh, I got, uh, I got, uh, oh, okay, a little short one here.  Ooh.  All right.  I'm not talking about my penis.  Hey.  Ah!  I'm sorry.  Well, uh.  Wow.  Uh, let us pray.  A Shintu priest who groped a 15-year-old girl's breast has been found not guilty of molesting her.  After claiming it was part of his religious practice,  Ryochi Sakamoto, 36, said he touched the teen to dispel negative vibes  after she came to his religious facility in Japan. 
[03:27:00]  And that's...  That's it.  The news from Munaki.  Wow.  Let's go to the phones.  We gotta go to the phones.  Ooh.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Homer online won.  How did you see that, jerk?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Uh, we're getting a bunch.  Uh, what a fucking dick.  It's great.  My God, that was torture. 
[03:27:30]  This guy's making Tom Brokaw sound like Shakespeare.  Uh.  So I'm hired?  Why couldn't Scott Peterson have killed Pat  instead of his wife, make it stop, sentence to a year of what,  listening to this illiterate, please play the Hulk music,  bring back stalker Patty.  She got $600?  Convisted.  I got bigger breasts than her.  Did he just say convisted? 
[03:28:00]  This guy could be the worst.  I have no idea what he's talking about.  End it.  Pat and Kenny should co-anchor.  Pat's reading is going to induce seizures.  We're going to do a co-anchor segment.  We'll get Lady Di and Marion together.  We'll get Pat and maybe Clubs and Kenny together.  Yeah, that way they could have banter.  Henri and maybe Bernie Getz.  We're trying to get Bernie Getz to do the news.  That'll be great.  He'll do it.  All right, well, thank you, Pat.  Any final thoughts? 
[03:28:30]  No.  Again.  You have no eyebrows, I just noticed.  I got eyebrows, I just got a big fat face.  It's all a whole relative thing there.  Those would be huge eyebrows on someone else.  Why are your cheeks so rosy?  Probably humiliation.  That'll do it.  Why what?  I got another visual thing. 
[03:29:00]  All right, a visual joke from Pat.  In his pocket?  Yeah.  I want to show you a picture of my pride and joy.  He's got the pride and joy card.  Now, Jerry.  Jerry.  Ma, I'm practicing for the news tomorrow.  Ma, please stop calling me.  You keep that.  Thank you.  Mom!  I'm not going to order.  I have to do this now.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  All right, Pat.  Thank you.  All right.  Pat, bang up job again.  Okay.  Thank you.  Wonderful.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm just bleeped now.  Comfortable leaving.  He's leaving with the headphones on.  His headphones are on.  I already pulled his head off.  They were ready to snap his head back.  All right.  Anthony.  Did you hear that one?  What did he say?  He goes, there's a studio following me. 
[03:30:00]  He walked out with the headphones on and jerked his neck back.  He goes, there's a studio following me.  For the people that don't get it.  Goddamn, that's funny.  Give it time.  Because I didn't get it at first.  Now I can't get enough of the guy.  I've never seen lower back tits in my life than on him, by the way.  Yeah.  He's got two sets of back tits.  He's so big.  It's a disaster.  He's a big guy.  All right.  Where's Steve?  Wow.  Steve's alter ego came up with a new Ramon promo, Anthony. 
[03:30:30]  Pat from Unaki.  We got a new Ramon, huh?  Do we have an example of an old Ramon?  Let's play the old Ramon promo just to give the new listeners a taste of what's going on here.  Just listen to this.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  It's in my shoes.  Ramon, clean this up.  Right.  The original.  The one that started it all.  And here's the creator, Steve. 
[03:31:00]  Martini Steve, everyone.  Hi.  Hey, Steve.  Steve.  Have you been working hard?  Yeah.  Well, you have to think of different scenarios.  Keep the franchise going?  Yeah.  Sure.  Exactly.  You don't want the heat to wear off or anything like that.  Well, but you also don't want to burn the guy out.  Not overkill, right?  Exactly.  It's a fine line, a delicate balance.  You really have to think about what kind of scenarios Ramon would actually take part in  and be around him.  All right.  All right.  And give the quick explanation of what the Ramon promos are all about. 
[03:31:30]  Because we see the numbers every day.  Every day there's brand new people tuning into the show for the first time.  So we've got to kind of keep people up to date.  Go ahead.  There's a deep voice guy, an eccentric, wealthy deep voice guy who does his promos for the  Opie and Anthony show, does them remotely.  And sometimes things happen during little segments that he's recording, and he can't be bothered  with the menial task of dealing with these little things because he's just too wealthy. 
[03:32:00]  He can't be bothered.  So he has a little houseboy or a little manservant named Ramon, who will never be heard from,  never be seen, just referenced, really.  And Ramon takes care of whatever menial tasks need tending to.  All right.  Perfect.  Dark, you got another example?  All right.  Here we go.  Another Ramon promo.  I just love a drive in the country laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low. 
[03:32:30]  Don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon, call 911.  So Ramon does his dirty work for him.  Yeah.  I mean, well, not even dirty work, because calling 911 really isn't dirty work.  That's simply, you know, course of action after an accident like that.  A plane hits his Bentley.  Right. 
[03:33:00]  That's pretty serious.  Yeah, exactly.  But Ramon is Johnny on the spot and takes care of all the things.  Very resourceful little fella.  He's just his houseboy.  There's no sexual contact.  No, we haven't really revealed any kind of relationship these guys have other than employer and manservant.  Yeah.  All right.  Are we ready for the new Ramon promo?  Oh, can't wait.  Premiere.  Here's the premiere.  I wish we had a drum roll or something.  Something dramatic.  Something dramatic would be nice.  Something like, yeah, when they used to premiere a brand new video on MTV, fanfare, something. 
[03:33:30]  All right.  We're looking for some fanfare.  We need some fanfare.  Oh.  Oh.  Derek is, uh.  Derek, I love watching Derek work.  Yeah.  He's trying.  Look at him.  Pressing buttons.  Oh, look.  He gives the thumbs up.  He's like a beautiful mind, Anthony.  It's very quick.  All right.  Let's hear what Derek's got.  Oh, Jesus.  That's a good one.  That was awful.  Here we go.  I got one.  All right.  We are ready for the world exclusive.  This one goes on forever. 
[03:34:00]  How do you stop it?  All right.  Just like that.  All right.  Here we go.  The new Ramon promo.  There is nothing quite like a Cuban cigar.  Right, Ramon?  The rich texture.  The full flavor.  So relaxing.  Oh, fiddlesticks.  No ashtray.  Ramon, open your mouth. 
[03:34:30]  Wow.  He's flicking cigar ashes into Ramon's mouth?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, he didn't have an ashtray.  He didn't want to screw up his expensive Persian rug.  So Ramon has lower self-esteem than Patty.  Patty does.  And obviously what I'm getting from that is there wasn't enough time to ask Ramon to go  get an ashtray.  No.  That ash was ready to go.  That ash was ready to hit the ground.  Yeah.  And in a pinch, you need a solution.  And the solution is Ramon.  Ramon.  Ramon and his little mouth.  That's great.  Does Ramon make enough money to do this? 
[03:35:00]  It doesn't matter.  Ramon is being saved from a life of poverty in a third world country.  Ramon is grateful for the work and for shelter.  And he lives there, yeah.  Yeah.  He has his little servant's quarters, so he's living large.  Exactly.  He lives in this palatial estate, you know, and he's got to take a few cigar ashes in  the mouth to keep his job.  Then so be it.  So be it.  Exactly.  I gotcha.  Wow, I like that one.  Very dramatic, too.  I like the sounds getting better.  I get the echo of the big room he was in. 
[03:35:30]  I picture a huge marble room.  Yeah.  Very good.  You really do.  You just have to, and I have to thank Nathaniel for the, and Danny, for the brainstorming  effort it took to come up with a degrading enough.  Oh, look, he's thanking.  It's like an award show.  It really is.  Well, but you know what?  Those guys do a lot of work, and it's not fair not to credit them for any hope they give  out, so.  All right.  Well, the winner is Steve C. for Ramon and the cigar.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Great.  I think as we go to break, we'll play another Ramon promo for the new listeners, so they 
[03:36:00]  get the feel for what this is all about, right?  Ramon.  And then when we come back, I guess we should talk about our LA trip a little bit.  We got a girl on the line, Celeste from Connecticut.  She has a boyfriend that lets her bang other guys.  We'll get into that a little bit.  And Dawn wants to try out for the news.  Really?  We'll see what her spin would be on that, right?  Oh, I wonder if she's the girl I met in Eatontown.  I got a number for you guys.  There's a girl that wants to come in and do the news.  Really?  Yeah.  Is her name Dawn? 
[03:36:30]  I don't remember.  Is she just going to do regular news, or?  I don't know.  Let's hope not.  We'll see what she's about as well.  Does she do news with a mule in her ass?  That'll be interesting to watch.  All right.  But first, here's another Ramon promo.  State of the Union.  Gas prices going up again.  The Opiate Anthony Show on XM.  Who goes the weasel?  Ramon, give me your sleeve. 
[03:37:00]  He shoots.  That's his foot.  ACC basketball.  It's the ACC Today.  Tie your shoes nice and tight because ACC basketball is breaking you down.  You better box your man out because we're grabbing the boards.  Round ball, baby.  It's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  Cut off the ricochet.  It's Friday, the 18th of February, 2005.  I'm Ari Bajkowski with the ACC Today.  Julius Hodge, one-on-one against Cater Medley.  Takes him into the lane. 
[03:37:30]  Flips it out to Eftimov.  Pops a three.  Hits.  Everything starts with Julius Hodge.  Two possessions in a row.  He's created open opportunities for his teammates.  That's Julius at his best.  Backdoor pass to Eftimov.  Left corner for Bethel.  Jump shot in the air for three.  Got it.  Tony Bethel.  Big shot.  13 points for Bethel.  68-56 pack.  Timeout Maryland.  Wolfpack Radio Network on the call.  And what happened to the Terps?  One day they knock off Duke.  The next night they get clobbered.  On Wednesday, Maryland went down 82-63 to NC State. 
[03:38:00]  Gary Williams knows what hurt his team in this game.  Yeah, they kicked it well.  We got caught hopping too much sometimes, and they were able to really find the open mat.  They made enough threes.  They didn't shoot it great from the three-point line, but 13 for 30, that was good enough tonight.  NC State head coach Herb Zendek talks about what his team did well.  I just think guys were looking for each other.  Guys understand the value of sharing the basketball, and we've been playing pretty well together. 
[03:38:30]  We've been trying to execute and be a team.  Now Julius Hodge is the leader of his NC State squad.  He knows that after this big win, he and his teammates must stay grounded.  We're definitely going to stay focused and prepared, and we're going to stay humble,  and we enjoy winning tonight.  But it's still a long road, and we have to stay consistent right now.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  All right, let's go to the phones. 
[03:39:00]  Say hi to William in Boston.  What's up, William?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  How are you, bro?  Hey, good, man. 
[03:39:30]  I think you guys should replace Jim Norton with Pat Monarky.  He's funnier.  He brings more stuff to the show.  He's right on point with the news.  And Jimmy sucks, you know?  No, Jimmy's great.  You're a madman.  I can't really hear you guys.  Well, it's not a bad idea.  The next time Jimmy hits the road, maybe we could have Pat fill in for Jimmy.  Oh, wow.  Imagine that.  That could be a very slow show.  Imagine that.  All right.  If you're on the road, Jimmy, maybe we bring in Pat.  Pat sits there in your seat. 
[03:40:00]  Imagine Pat for an entire show throwing out those one-liners.  You couldn't be any worse than I was today.  I have nothing all day.  I'm just tired.  You're inspirational just sitting there, Jimmy.  John from New York.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, John.  Hey, Sugar Tush.  Hi there, John.  You know, I've been listening to you guys since the third day.  We're on N.E.W.  Yeah.  And car crash, not even.  That was a train wreck.  Which one, Pat? 
[03:40:30]  On the news read.  Oh, well, yeah.  You guys, what is this, Crash and Burn Friday?  Patty, naked.  Oh, that was hilarious.  And I suppose next week it's going to be Lady Di and Huff Fat Friend.  Not a bad idea.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow, that guy was just bad.  That guy was awful.  What an awful caller.  Had no charisma, no energy, no pizzazz.  Nothing.  Just a flatliner. 
[03:41:00]  Some people just aren't funny.  That's right, Pat.  Very good.  We picked up on that.  Let's go to Dawn in Staten Island.  Dawn?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Hey.  How are you?  Good.  You belong in a dump on Staten Island.  What do you got today, Dawn?  I actually did meet you guys in the Stress Factory.  I met Opie and Jimmy.  Okay, you said you wanted to come in and do the news, right?  Yes.  I still have your number on that pink paper. 
[03:41:30]  I don't want to take off my bra.  Wait, what?  I'll do it with my shirt off if you want.  But you won't take your bra off?  No.  Are you the one with the big cans?  The big cans?  You got big boobs?  Yes, I do.  I got double Ds.  I think you were in black, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Then why wouldn't you do a topless with double Ds?  Because, I don't know, they're like a little saggy because they're big.  We don't care.  You don't care?  No, have you seen us? 
[03:42:00]  You're not that ugly, Jimmy.  You probably could get a girl.  Thanks.  That's very inspirational.  You're probably good.  Thanks.  You're a real pep talk giver.  Well, what's going to be your gimmick to do the news?  So far, all the people that have done the news, they've had some kind of gimmick for the most part.  Oh, I don't know what you guys would want, but I could actually read.  That doesn't seem to be a prerequisite.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I don't know.  I thought topless would be good.  But the bra's got to be off.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh. 
[03:42:30]  Well, she's a minimal.  Topless news?  Yeah.  And I'm not saying.  Should we go for bottomless?  No.  All right.  We'll do topless news with Dawn from Staten Island.  Okay.  All right.  That sounds good, guys.  What do you think?  We'll be here in five minutes.  Hold on the line.  Pat's trying the Jedi mind trick on her.  Perhaps bottomless.  No.  Wrong.  Let's go to Shwuggy.  Shwuggy.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, buddy.  Hello?  Yeah.  Oh, hey, Anthony.  I've got a tip for you for what to wear when you play poker next week.  Oh, a gimmick?  Yes. 
[03:43:00]  Wear a mesh shirt with nipples cut out.  And after you raise someone, lean back, pinch your nipples, and give a little kiss.  Yeah.  Wow.  That one.  I was thinking of that.  Come on.  Think about that.  That would have to nerve whoever you're betting, especially some of these celebrities you're  going to be playing against.  Yeah.  Think about that.  All right.  All right.  I will.  Actually, you should wear a Chinese mask.  Then they won't be able to see your expression.  Oh. 
[03:43:30]  Oh.  Actually, Opie.  Actually, on 57th Street.  Yes.  Got a little coverage on allaccess.com.  Oh, yeah?  About our little trip we're taking out to L.A.  Yeah.  We're going next week.  You're going to be at the World Poker Tour, and we're broadcasting live Wednesday and Thursday  from L.A.  Go ahead, John.  Yes.  It says, on Wednesday, February 23rd, World Poker Tour Poker Corner radio host David Stein  and Opie and Anthony's Anthony Cumia will join celebrities and poker pros at the Commerce 
[03:44:00]  Casino in L.A. to play for $200,000 at the World Poker Tour Invitational.  Well, David and Anthony have been invited to share a table with poker legend Doyle Brunson  and some guy named David Schwimmer.  David Schwimmer?  He's going to be at the same table as you?  My pal David Schwimmer.  Yeah, we're getting a lot of press over this little thing.  That's going to hit the paper soon that you're going to be playing poker with David Schwimmer.  A bunch of other top-name celebrities and poker players, and there you go. 
[03:44:30]  Listeners of World Poker Tour Poker Corner, and Opie and Anthony will get to hear how the  guys' chip counts are holding up.  World Poker Tour Poker Corner radio show?  You heard of that one?  No.  Check that out.  Can our listeners check this out, too, when we're in L.A.?  I don't know.  We don't know, right?  Let's see.  Well, we'll be in New York on Monday and Tuesday, and then we fly Tuesday after the show, I guess.  So then we'll have more details next week.  More celebrities that are going to be there.  The list is ‚Äì Ben is, like, all saying they're very secretive about the list, and he's going 
[03:45:00]  to be getting the list.  What's the matter, sweetie?  Ben, what about the celebrity list?  We'll have more today.  They're just very tight on it.  More today?  Very tight.  It will evolve.  I'm hearing things, though.  I'm hearing, like, Bill Shatner.  Yeah, I heard that one.  I'm hearing ‚Äì what's his name?  James Woods, perhaps.  The tournament, you mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be very cool.  Ozzy Osbourne.  There could be some good radio next Wednesday and Thursday.  Of course, Thursday I'll be gone.  That's when all the big celebrities will come in.  Of course.  That's the day Ozzy's coming.  Of course.  That's the day all your pictures could have been taken. 
[03:45:30]  If Ozzy was coming, I would just not go to Houston until Friday.  Really?  Yeah.  Ben, are the listeners still enjoying Pat from Menocchio?  Pat's great.  Pat's hilarious.  I love Pat.  I love Pat.  Yeah, Ben's a big fan of Pat.  I love Pat.  I guess Wednesday will be a whipping out to L.A. Wednesday.  Wednesday.  What?  Wow.  Wow.  That was awful.  That could have actually been identified as a dramatic statement.  Yeah, that was awful on so many levels.  Celeste. 
[03:46:00]  Celeste?  It was like Ambulance Friday.  Did we lose Celeste?  Celeste?  No, I'm here.  Hi.  What's going on, Celeste?  Hello?  What's your peaches?  Celeste.  What?  You're on the radio.  Oh, I can't even hear you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, you know, please fix the volume of the phones.  Please.  So, yeah, my boyfriend lets me go out and bang guys.  What?  Yeah.  You can just go out and have sex with guys?  Yep.  Anytime I want.  And why are you boyfriend and girlfriend?  Why?  Isn't that just being friends? 
[03:46:30]  Because we have a very unique relationship.  How long have you been with the guy?  Huh?  How long have you been with the guy?  I've been with him for like almost 10 years now.  10 years?  Does he bang other girls?  Does he?  Yes, he does bang other girls.  Oh.  Friends with benefits.  And do you live together?  Yeah, and he's married.  He's married.  Do you hook up with the wife?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah, we all live together in the same house.  You all live together in the same house?  Yeah.  And you bring guys home?  Yeah, I bring guys home. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  And him and his wife bring guys.  Well, she goes out and fucks guys, too.  Really?  She hasn't brought any home yet, but.  Where is this utopia?  Where is this utopia?  Sounds like.  Munaki.  We live in Connecticut.  What part?  In Norwich.  Oh.  Wow.  Are you the one that emailed us?  No.  It's another one.  I didn't email you.  All right.  I'm trying to figure all this out.  So, everyone's banging.  Yeah.  Did you guys all meet in a swingers club or something?  Say that again?  Did you meet in a swingers club? 
[03:47:30]  No.  No, we're not in a swingers club.  How did you hook up?  How did this all come about?  We all used to work together in the same place.  And we all just started hanging out together.  And it just kind of happened.  What place did you work at?  Hustler?  It was a place that did, like, data entry kind of stuff.  It was just an office environment.  All right.  So, we've all been in the office environment.  Yeah.  How does it go from just saying hi at the water cooler to, hey, come on over.  We're going to bang tonight.  I don't know.  It just kind of, like, I started, like, hanging out at their house.  And then one day, he made the move on me. 
[03:48:00]  And after that, it was, um, that was it.  How does it go from data entry to rear entry?  Huh?  Hold on.  Oh!  What do you look like?  What do I look like?  Are you attractive?  Yes, I am.  Oh.  And, uh, how long were they married?  When it all started?  Now, how long are they married for?  They've been married a little over ten years.  A little over ten years.  Yeah.  So, you came into the scene shortly after.  And you've been all living together for ten years?  Well, actually, we just started living together about two years ago. 
[03:48:30]  Uh-huh.  Before that, um, we all, they lived in one house.  And I lived in another house across the street.  Right.  And do you just screw every night?  No, well, we have a lot of sex, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you bi?  I'm sorry?  Are you bisexual?  Yes.  Hmm.  We do threesomes, and, yeah.  Nice.  All right.  Well, sounds great.  It is great.  Good luck with it.  Thanks.  Do you have photos?  Uh, there are some pictures, yeah.

We've got a delay.  If you could.  Okay.  I could slam worse than you.  Well, I don't know if I could type that fast.  I usually screw up.  How do I send it to you, then?  Yeah, just, uh, give it a try.  All right.  Go ahead.  Say that again?  Go ahead.  What's the website?  It's, uh, W, go to HTTP.  Yeah, we know that.

All right, continue.  This is sexy.  Um, images.  Gallery.  Private.  Ooh.  It says gallery.  Private.  I don't see anything. 
[03:50:00]  Uh, you're going to screw this all up.  Miss?  I see no private.  No private?  I see, I see continue on the front page.  I click on that.  It says fantasy artwork by Sky.  Yeah.  Looks like a Molly Hatchett cover.  How did they get to, um...  That's funny.  It does.  Molly Hatchett.  Wow, that's some good images.  Ooh.  That's you?  Did you find them?  No, I just...  Who's the hot, who's the hot model? 
[03:50:30]  You?  Who's the hot...  No.  It says gallery, prints, contact, home.  Uh, E-team.  How did they get there?  Or is it...  They can only get there through the URL.  Oh, my God.  All right.  You have to type it in.  Email your pictures.  Here's what you can do.  It's a founding music site.  Yellowtreats at AOL.com.  Say that again?  Y-E-L-L-O-W-T-R-E-A-T-S at AOL.com.  We never see any of that stuff that goes to your email.  I always get the stuff.  They always send it to me, to you guys. 
[03:51:00]  And, um...  That's Y-E-L-L-O-W-T-R...  Listen, we're going to punch out, Celeste.  T-R-E-A-T-S.  There's something about you that's really annoying me.  And number seven...  And if you've got any really other hardcore pictures, like big cocks or whatever...  I feel like I have to send them to you.  Hold on.  Ben.Sparks at XMRadio.com.  But only pictures of big cocks.  That's where I like to get my big cock pictures.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Celeste.  That's the hospital website.  All right.  Thanks.  Docs with cocks. 
[03:51:30]  Yow.  All right.  We're running out of steam.  Let's say hi to Tom in Philly.  Tom, what's up?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, uh...  What's up there, bitch kids?  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, it's all good, Jamie.  It's hard to hear you guys.  Yeah, that's what everyone says.  Can I do a what did I learn?  Sure.  All right.  I learned that a bus ride to Atlantic City costs four and a quarter.  Yeah.  Paying your phone bill so you can call your friends when you get there, $42.50.  And then seeing Jimmy Norton at the Borgata on April 16th is priceless. 
[03:52:00]  Priceless.  Tickets on sale, $2.20.  Ah, $2.26 tickets on sale.  Tom, what are you doing?  Ben, Steve and I just saw the pictures.  Oh.  Her husband looks like Earl.  A bad Earl, right?  Yeah.  It's not pretty.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I actually might have...  No.  No, no.  Steve found them tomorrow.  I'll show you where they are.  I found them.  Private?

How ugly is the girl?  All right.  Whoa!  Gotcha.  Hey, now.  Yeah.  She's not that bad.  Go to the picture of the Earl.  She's not that bad.  You're really...  Really? 
[03:53:00]  I said not that bad.  I'm not saying she's a supermodel.  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  Jesus Christ.  Come on.  She's got gravy-stained nips.  All right.  It's not bad.  Let's end the show.  Let's just end the show.  Go to the first one.  All right.  Do we have time to play an old classic?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  What's going on there, huh?  That's the three of them?  That's the three of them with all glasses on?  Are you insane? 
[03:53:30]  There's kind of a black guy.  Kind of?  Yeah, I guess he's a chicken.  And the chick.  And the girl.  Arthur Ashe.  Arthur Ashe.  And Amy Carter.  Arthur Ashe.  And Amy Carter, the one on the right.  Yeah, Amy Carter.  All right.  Oh, God damn.  All right.  Norton farted.  I'm done.  We have nothing left.  We want to thank Stalker Patty for stopping by.  If you're just tuning in and you're ready for the replay, make sure you check out Let's Make a Deal with Stalker Patty.  Hey, Jesus.  Smells like comedy in here. 
[03:54:00]  That is really bad.  I had some whipped cream.  Oh, my God.  That rancid whipped cream has been sitting down for five hours.  Holy crap.  Yeah, the whipped cream went to my system, wasn't it?  I got to get out of here.  This is the worst ever.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Did you get any of that?  Yeah, we did.  What a mess.  All right.  We're going to end with an Opie and Anthony classic.  I was tooling around the Internet last night, and I saw, like, some animation done to this bit.  It's called They Call My Name's Bill. 
[03:54:30]  Call My Name's Bill.  And have a great weekend, and we'll see you guys on Monday.  All Time Association, may I help you?  Hello?  I have this number in my wallet.  I don't know where I am.  You don't know where you are?  I have this number in my wallet.  You're lost?  I don't know.  I'm at a phone booth.  Give me the phone number.  It's not on here.  There's no phone number on the phone?  Let me look.  What phone?  You're calling from a phone. 
[03:55:00]  Is there a phone number there?  Yes, there is.  Could I have the phone number?  I believe it's an 8.  Hold on the phone.  Can you hold on?  Don't hang up.  Hello?  Yes, can you hear me?  Who's this?  This is a cell.  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Don't hang the phone up.  Hang up?  No, do not hang up.  Hold on, please.  Don't hang up.  I'm going to put you on the phone with someone else.  Hold on.  Hang up what?  No.  It's cold.  You're cold?  I'm colder, yes.  I know.  Cold like Brazil.  Yes, it's a weird thing. 
[03:55:30]  Wait.  Do you know?  I believe I need a changing.  Stay on the phone.  I'm wet.  You're all wet?  Yeah, I'm wet.  Okay.  Well, you just stay on the phone.  I need a changing and my nurse isn't here.  And do you know the phone number?  Who you are?  Can you tell me the number?  Can you please?  I'm going to walk across the street now.  No, stay on the phone.  Who's this now?  My name is Judy.  What's yours?  I call my name's Bill.  Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  Hi, Sam.  You sound a little lost.  I'm going to walk across the street now. 
[03:56:00]  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't  talk to you.  Whoa, hey.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please?  This is Judy.  Is this Bill?  Where's Sam?  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Oh.  Sam knows I hate coffee.  Well, maybe he went to get you a call, and he said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now. 
[03:56:30]  A lot of cars.  What?  I'm going to cross the street now.  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street.  All right.  Here I go.  I know.  I can't talk to you.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go.  Are you talking on the phone, Bill?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, we should have called the police while we have him.  Well, he's doing good.  He's still here.  Call the police.  He did.  He probably will tip on the phone.  He did not hang up. 
[03:57:00]  He put the phone down and walk.  He dropped the phone.  He did not hang up.  Oh, my God.  Somebody call an ambulance.  See?  I told you.  Now, this is horrible.  Oh, my God.  He looks awful.  Jesus.  Who is this?  Who am I speaking to, please?  Somebody call an ambulance.  Help over here.  Somebody got hit.  This is horrible.  We're calling an ambulance.  Can you give me the address?  He's a mess.  The man got hit.  Someone call an ambulance.  Don't touch him.  Leave him down there.  Hello?  Can you give me...  Tell me where you are.  It's too late. 
[03:57:30]  It's too late.  There's this bad spirit all over the road.  Can you tell me where you are?  It's too late unless you got a shovel.  All right.  Well, get a shovel.  Where are you?  It's too late.  It isn't too late.  You can't help anymore.  It's too late.  It's too late.  That's pretty a shovel.  Can you tell me where you are right now?  Disneyland.  In Disneyland.  Can you tell me where in Disneyland? 
[03:58:00]  Pirates of the Caribbean.  And the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  A pirate's life for me.  I'm okay now.  You're okay?  You got all pulled yourself together again?  A car hit me and I feel fine now.  Oh, I'm so glad you feel fine, Bill.  You had me really worried.  That's all Bill needed was a little bumper.  Can you tell me where you are, Bill?  Jupiter.  On Jupiter.  Planet Jupiter.  Is there a street number or a name on planet Jupiter? 
[03:58:30]  23 Jupiter.  23 Jupiter.  23.  Okay.  Do you live there?  Send a cab.  I would happily send a cab if you tell me where to send it.  Tell them to make a right at Venus.  Right at Venus.  And it's Jupiter.  28 Jupiter.  28?  That's what I said.  Okay.  And what are you doing there now?  Masturbating.  Oh, I see.  Okay. 
[03:59:00]  I think we're off the air.  All right.  Don.  I hate that they can do that to us.  What was the last word that was said tonight?  Today?  What?  That ought to hold the little fuckers.
