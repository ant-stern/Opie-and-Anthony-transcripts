<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with the "After ONA Live" segment, featuring a rotating cast of hosts: Sam Roberts, Jim, Club Soda Kenny, Troy, and Roland.  A "wheel of hosts" determined the day's host, randomly landing on Rob Cross (Arizona DJ Chuck Roast), who wasn't initially present.  Cross, upon hearing his name, frantically rushed to the studio, recounting a story of interrupting Robin Quivers and his limo driver in his haste.  His hosting style was described as improvisational and conversational, resulting in many tangents.  A significant portion of this segment involved criticisms of the show's management and their decisions, often expressed through the hosts' discussions and numerous listener calls echoing similar sentiments.  The phrase "wrinkling motherfucker" was repeatedly used.  A voice demo of Cross from his earlier radio career was played, showcasing various commercial voice-overs.  The conversation touched upon previous guests (Linda Hogan, Henry Winkler) and upcoming guests (Michael Rapaport), and compared the hosting styles and performances of different personalities, further highlighting frustrations with management's influence on the show's content. Listener calls, besides reflecting dissatisfaction with management, also included unrelated personal stories and self-promotional attempts.

The broadcast then shifted to a segment featuring Opie and Anthony.  Opie voiced frustration with Anthony's reliance on a guest named Sam, referring to him as a "crutch," contrasting it with Anthony's successful interactions with callers. The conversation transitioned to Michael Rapaport, discussing his acting career and the success of his father in reviving the failing New York radio station Disco 92 in the 1970s. The possibility of having Rapaport's father as a guest was briefly considered. The segment ended with the announcement that the Opie and Anthony show was ending (again), along with a promotion of their Facebook page and broadcast times.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I'm back. It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Jim.  Yeah, with Club Soda Kenny.  Yes, Kenny's here.  Jim's still here.  A lot of people here. Troy's here. Roland's here.  It's the wheel of hosts. We're going to spin it.  Jim is on his way out, though.  What should I do with this? 
[00:00:30]  He's got a Boneyard show to do.  That's right.  No, those are all live, Kenny.  You come in here at 10 o'clock at night?  Yeah, yeah, hey, you know, I come back.  Rough schedule.  Hey, E-Rock, I want to get my Selena Gomez picture signed  because a lot of 42-year-old men want to.  Yes.  And I have it marked.  Okay.  But I'm afraid that you're going to leave it up at the front like this  and they're not going to know there's a picture in here.  I will not do that for you.  I will take care of it for you.  What should I do with it?  Just leave it right there. I'll come and grab it.  You want me to come over and give it to you?  If you want to bring it over here, that'd be better.  All right, I'll just leave it right here.  Would it be better if I...  You won't wrinkle it? 
[00:01:00]  No.  He said he might.  Yeah, I know.  He's a wrinkling motherfucker.  He's a wrinkling motherfucker.  Kenny.  Eric, can you safeguard these two things till tomorrow, too?  I can do that as well.  Put those on the couch.  I'll take care of those.  Is Mars around?  If Mars is around, come in here.  Mars, the star of the after show yesterday.  That's what I want to talk to him about.  Same good.  It's me, Sam.  Kenny, uh...  This is my imitation of Mars.  973, go ahead.  What's that mean?  I don't...  He was taking calls and just identifying the callers by their area code.  Well, we don't screen here. 
[00:01:30]  Can I add you to the wheel of hosts today since you're still here, or might you be leaving  early?  You probably didn't hear it the first time I said I don't work for free.  Okay.  Mars.  What up, fellas?  So you did the show yesterday.  We're in the middle of the wheel of hosts.  Wait, wait, Sam.  Mars, what are you supposed to do?  With what?  You know.  No, I don't.  Say it.  Oh, that's right.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Thank you, Mars.  Hilarious.  Um, Mars, so you...  That's about not you.  That's right.  That's right, Chip.  You did a good job yesterday, man. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you, man.  No!  I couldn't think of a way to shut him down, so I just said no.  You almost said not you, though, because you said no.  But I just couldn't improv it fast enough, so I went no, and I stopped in shame.  Mars, how did you feel about...  You won the wheel of hosts yesterday.  You got to host the show.  How did you feel about your performance?  I felt comfortable.  I got mixed reviews, but from what I heard...  He was good.  He was good, and I felt good that he was actually taking it seriously.  Like, it sounded like you wanted to really host a show.  Absolutely.  As opposed to just being like, you know, who cares about this? 
[00:02:30]  What do you say, Roland?  Who's this week?  Who's this week?  It's a wheel.  It's a spinning random wheel.  Now, Mars, are you upset that your turn's over, or are you good with one?  No, he's like American Idol.  You may cast off.  Move on.  Who's next?  I had a lot of fun.  I would love to do it again.  If I'm given the opportunity, I will be more than happy.  Okay, well, you know, some people were critical of your work.  Of course they were.  They're always going to be, aren't they?  Absolutely.  But you know what?  From what I heard, for a person who's never hosted a radio show before, pretty good job. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  Way to go, Mars.  And that's the thing that this wheel of hosts is doing.  We're discovering possible new stars.  Do I want to do the wheel of hosts?  No.  I don't think it's a very good idea at all.  But it's, you know, it's an idea when the bosses, not the management bosses, the main talent on the channel.  The real bosses?  Yeah.  When the main talent on the channel says, this is what you should do, you do it, don't you?  So without further ado, I mean, Troy, you're still on the wheel.  Yep.  Roland, you're on the wheel.  Ooh.  Kenny, I don't even, you're not on the wheel. 
[00:03:30]  No.  You don't work for free.  Because you don't work for free.  No, I don't.  I'm Club Soda Kenny, damn it.  On Facebook.  Dot com.  That's right.  Well, without.  Episode of one word.  They got rid of the imposter page.  Thank God.  Yeah.  Also.  We can't keep talking.  We don't have a host.  All of you are on the wheel except for you, Kenny.  But if I meet Kenny, go to 675 Bartonai and meet Packing District.  That's not.  We'll get to.  There it is.  We'll get to all of it.  We don't have a host.  Okay.  Travis is still on the list. 
[00:04:00]  You're interrupting the flow.  Danny is still on the list.  The Ron and Fez crew is still on the list.  Eric, you have the wheel in there, right?  Yeah.  We have it in here.  All right.  So what I want you to do is I want you to spin the wheel and then whatever name it lands  on, just send it to me in here.  Okay?  All right.  Okay.  Here we go.  Wow.  Look at it go.  You're looking as bad as Hulk Hogan's performance.  In what?  I don't know.  Oh, it's stopping. 
[00:04:30]  It's slow.  Out of rhythm.  Black or red.  Let's see.  React to it, Eric.  This was unexpected.  Okay.  He's sending it in here.  Oh, my goodness.  What?  None other.  I mean, are you ready for this, Troy?  Yeah, go ahead.  Because, Troy, you are not hosting today.  It's not your turn yet.  All right.  It's not your turn yet.  I saw the name.  It's not me.  But he has all his notes out.  I know, but it's not Troy's turn.  He didn't win.  It's a random wheel.  He might not get to host. 
[00:05:00]  That's the thing about the wheel of hosts, because this piece of paper in front of me  that came off the wheel says that today's host is none other than Arizona DJ Chuck Roast,  Mr. Rob Cross himself.  Rob Cross, come down here.  Come on.  You know, we always hear about management.  We always hear about, you know, what Obi refers to as the cute guys.  This is one of them.  Rob Cross's name popped up on the wheel, and he's going to be hosting the show today.  You might have to give him a call, because he might not be listening.  Well, I would.  He's actually on a delay. 
[00:05:30]  His radio is.  Where is he?  He should know he's on the wheel.  I mean, I told him to be prepared for this.  I bet she's hiding.  All right, where's Rump Roast if he's not here?  He's not in his office.  Well, I mean, that's what the wheel landed on, you know?  I mean, if the people on the wheel who've been informed they're on the wheel aren't going  to take this seriously, I don't know how any of us can.  I feel like Mars set the bar yesterday by taking this thing seriously.  I mean, if nobody else is interested in doing this, we won't continue it. 
[00:06:00]  I'm happy to host my show.  Was that an earthquake?  Oh, never mind.  It's just the record.  Don't punish us all.  I'll do it again.  Well, your name was already called off the wheel.  Your name is not still on the wheel, Mars.  He had such a good time.  I know.  He did.  He was talking jujitsu.  Well, you're supposed to be talking about, like, O&A.  I did.  Oh, you did.  Okay.  He played clips.  All right.  Well, then, let's take these calls.  No, let's not.  Line one.  What are you thinking about this Rob Cross situation?  Well, I just got a question for Rob Cross. 
[00:06:30]  He's not in here yet.  What's your name, mister?  Oh, my name is John.  Yeah, where's your manners?  I'm going to put you on hold, John, okay?  Okay.  For when Rob gets back in here.  How about you, line two?  Yep.  You didn't turn your radio down.  Line three.  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  You just put Mars back on, Sam.  He did a great job.  You think so?  I love Rob Cross.  Oh, Rob Cross is coming.  Sorry.  Oh, he's got a pad.  Here he comes.  He's running up. 
[00:07:00]  And somebody's got to make room for him at one of these mics.  Ladies and gentlemen, your host for the morning, Mr. Rob Cross.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  I'm upstairs.  I mean, I don't know if you want to start with an introduction or whatever, but it's  your show.  Take it away.  Well, I was upstairs taking a hearty mid-morning constitutional.  And then I stopped.  Yeah, that's exactly what that is.  And I stopped by to see Pepper Hicks and heard the wheel spin live.  And goddamn, I had to book it down here. 
[00:07:30]  So let's do this.  Sorry.  I actually, like in the lobby, I cut off Robin Quivers and Ronnie the limo driver on  the way out of the building so I could get here.  All right.  Let's roll.  Where's my worst of?  That's not how you do this.  Oh.  Yeah.  You're supposed to talk about the show.  Oh, the show.  Yeah.  You know, just come up with some kind of talking points.  Oh, the Opie and Anthony show?  I told you that you could be called on this wheel.  Where's the wheel, by the way?  Eric already put it away.  All right.  What happened with Robin and Ronnie? 
[00:08:00]  You should expand on that.  Oh, no.  I just, they were heading towards the door and I literally cut them off.  Come on.  Not really?  I literally ran right in front of them, Jimmy.  No.  Because I had to get here.  Dude, that didn't happen.  Yeah, it did happen.  Oof.  Like, literally.  It was rude.  Start off with a story that gets everybody invested in the show.  Yes, get some into it.  And then we go from there.  You know, another thing about Chuck Rost, he loves steak.  Look, I'm trying to stay out of this.  Everybody calls me a mic whore.  I'm trying to, you know, let the host have his day. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  Since it was such an epic show today, and we had Linda Hogan on, and we had Henry Winkler,  the Fonz on, and Bert the Conqueror.  There's obviously a lot of tangents we can go off of here.  So I'm thinking maybe we have some of, uh, some of, uh, Jimmy's, uh, Happy Days material 
[00:09:00]  from a number of years back.  Maybe we had.  You're not coming.  It's not a jukebox.  What?  Exactly.  I don't have any bits.  You go, I mean, you can go to some bits eventually, but you barely even set anything up yet.  Yeah, just talk.  You've been on the radio a long time.  You know what you're doing.  It's just, just chat.  Be conversational.  You can talk to, you can talk to Jim.  He's in here.  Troy, Roland, Mars, E-Rock's in the other room.  You can go to a caller.  I mean, whatever you want.  Hmm.  Or you can wake up Mars.  No, no, no.  Mars did a great job yesterday.  I really enjoyed MMA talk and, uh, men hitting on you. 
[00:09:30]  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  But you know what the difference is today?  What's that?  That I was in here by myself.  That's true.  That makes a big difference.  It does, yeah.  When you got the boss in here, you get a little intimidated.  And when you got a smartass over there shooting, uh, questions that you're derailing you, that  also makes it difficult.  So you're saying everyone should leave the studio?  Yeah.  Okay.  Aww.  Oh, really?  Oh, that sucks.  What about the calls?  Yeah, well, at least I have the callers.  Well, give out the phone number.  866-1-1-1. 
[00:10:00]  Anybody want to call?  Oh, they're lit.  All right.  Oh, can we go to the phones then, Sam?  Yeah.  Awesome.  Tell me, just, you can see, you can see the lines ringing.  Nobody's screening them anyway.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  So if you just say line one, line two, I'll pick them up.  All right, let's go to line, let's go to line one.  I'm going to host the shit out of this show.  Let's do this.  Yeah, I thought this thing was going to be promising, but this far into it, no.  Next caller.  Let's go. 
[00:10:30]  Line two.  Hey, what's up, boys?  I just want to say that this is sucks.  Now let's go to line three.  This has got to be better than this.  Listen, forget Rob Frost.  There was a slight panty shot of Selena Gomez and Richardson Kelly, which you sat down for the interview.  Oh, sweet breaking news.  Jimmy, are you leaving?  Yeah, I got it.  Jimmy, please don't, please don't leave, Jim.  Well, it's not, I got to take it.  Can you come back?  Yeah, I'll come back.  You promise?  Yes.  No, you don't.  Wait, where were we?  Selena Gomez? 
[00:11:00]  Panty shot?  Where?  Regis and Kelly.  Awesome.  A slight panty shot when she sat down.  And Rob, get these guys interns already.  Man, I know, I know.  Hey, have you guys seen the picture of E-Rock with Selena Gomez?  It's half of his face?  Yes, I've seen it.  Yeah, yeah.  And then like her, yeah, yeah, that's a great picture of E-Rock.  I've seen that.  I mean, that half of his face.  Let's get these guys to interns, huh?  All right.  Working on it.  That one's been kicked upstairs.  It's an action item. 
[00:11:30]  All right, line four.  Hey, Rob.  Hey.  What's up?  How about you stop cutting special deliveries hours?  Oh, I was wondering how long it was going to take for that to come up.  It was a fucking day show every day.  Every day.  Yeah, I was wondering how long it would take for that to come up.  What's...  I don't think we should...  I think we should hang up on him.  I was wondering how long that would take to come up because it's especially awkward because 
[00:12:00]  Sam is one of the hosts of Special Delivery and he's in here now.  And yeah, it's...  I mean, there's no secret that I've been working to actively suppress Special Delivery and its  hosts for a long time.  And I don't see that coming to an end anytime in the near future.  Oh, the lines are lit.  This is awesome.  Let's go to line five.  You're like on the air.  Hello?  Yeah, hey.  Am I on the air?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good times.  Yeah, so it's after Opie and Anthony live, by the way. 
[00:12:30]  I got a question for Rob Croft.  Yeah, yeah.  When do you get an intern?  I told you...  I told you that's an action item.  We've kicked it upstairs.  All right, line six.  Son of a bitch, this shit sucks.  Son of a bitch, that shit sucks isn't even a proper sentence. 
[00:13:00]  I don't think there's no subject to that.  All right.  So, I mean, I guess we could do this.  Like, yeah, right.  I am management.  And I do, you know, I am one of the...  A part of, I guess, like the three-headed dragon that oppresses the virus on the daily.  But, I mean, there's got to be some people out there who like management, right?  What?  No?  I wouldn't think so.  You don't think?  Dude, come on.  There's got to be some.  There's got to be some people who are like, the virus fucking rules. 
[00:13:30]  They're being treated...  This is how to run a channel.  And this is how talent should be treated.  And I just want to call and say thanks.  So, let's talk to those people.  Line one.  Line one, turn down your radio.  Never mind.  Line two.  Go to line two.  God, what a fail.  Fuck!  That's...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  There's got to be some people who like management.  Line three.  Yeah.  Line three. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, man.  What you guys doing?  Yeah, taking calls from people who love management.  Yeah, well, you ain't even doing a good job, man.  That's like...  What do you mean?  How am I not doing a good job?  You just ain't saying nothing.  You just kind of messing around with me.  I'm taking calls from my fans.  Come on!  This bag of shit should program a shotgun and eat it!  Come on!  All right.  That's only...  That's...  Line four.  Line four.  Eric, who's...  Sam, are you hitting the phones or is Eric? 
[00:14:30]  Uh, Eric.  Eric, God, man.  You gotta move faster.  Let's go.  It's a fucking...  It's a professional radio operation here.  Line four.  I hope someone's marking these.  Hello, line four.  You're on the air with management on over...  After Obi and Anthony live.  Hey, Rob, why don't you do us all a favor and fire Sam?  Nobody can stand them.  I'll fire...  Get rid of them.  Ah, Sam.  What the fuck, man?  What do you mean?  Your callers suck on this show.  Look, it's not... 
[00:15:00]  You can't...  They're not even...  They're not even into you.  I mean, I...  You can't blame the callers.  I don't.  All right.  Good point.  Line five.  Lyle.  Lyle.  Hey, your last name is Cross.  You probably would have just been hanging up or something.  Or a vampire is not...  What?  Line six.  Line six.  You stealing a lot of something?  You don't have to call on your Rob Cross. 
[00:15:30]  Line six, please.  Like a menorah or something.  You taking a cross?  Oh, God.  I remember when you were small, and I used to babysit you, and you used to crawl in there,  and I'd catch you looking up at my private parts.  But then you said you was looking at the TV.  I went, oh. 
[00:16:00]  This has gotten awkward.  Yeah.  Er.  Two places at one time.  Come back in, Jimmy.  All right.  Line seven.  Okay.  What's up?  You're on Oprah at...  After Opie and Anthony live.  Just fix the online feed, you fucking dick.  What?  Fix what?  The online feed.  Oh, fix that.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to do that right now. 
[00:16:30]  I had to host this show for the next 40 minutes.  The online feed's going to be jacked for a bit.  Okay.  All right.  What line are we on now?  One?  Let's go back to one.  Hi, this is John.  I'm calling from Denver, Colorado.  Awesome.  Hey, listen.  I just want to say Black Pistons forever.  Yeah.  Forever Black Pistons.  Jake and Del Rey, you real?  Oh, my God.  There's not anybody out there who likes management a little bit.  It's like...  Your callers are like down to this.  It's like people who swear or just relentlessly self-promote things that no one else understands. 
[00:17:00]  I do show every day.  I know.  How do you do it, Sam?  Well, people are starting to figure out it's tough.  It really is.  Where's the wheel, by the way?  It's in the other room.  The wheel is bullshit.  You don't have a wheel, do you?  You just completely taped...  You just decided Mars was hosting yesterday.  You decided I'm hosting today.  This is the shit that was going to happen.  Where is this?  Fucking bring out this oak and brass wheel.  I want to see it.  It's got to be gorgeous.  It's already heavy.  It's sitting in here.  I believe Opie's instructions were verbatim to make an actual wheel. 
[00:17:30]  It's locked in the wheel box.  I think it was literally like, fuck that shit.  I want a real wheel, right?  We spun the wheel, and your name came up.  Oh, what a load of shite.  Do we have any bits, or do I just got to sit here and take phone calls or do impressions  or something for 40 minutes?  It's your show, whatever you want.  Oh, awesome.  So then, if it's my show, did you go and pull that story from Rogan's podcast?  No, I didn't have time.  Oh, what the fuck?  You know what?  It's so fucking crystal clear now.  It is.  It's like, I know that Opie and Anthony will sometimes complain about this, that, or the 
[00:18:00]  other thing, the staff member, us in management, and now, like, I thought it was an hour ago  I asked you about that, wasn't it?  Well, it was right before they called me into the studio to do radio, so I couldn't.  Do radio?  You had all morning.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, this guy's on the show from, like, seven till when?  Sitting here at this board.  I'm not even shitting on you, Eric.  I'm just saying, like...  Sounds like you're shitting on me.  Like, you get in this chair and you just shit on Eric, it's incredible, I don't know  what happens.  No, but, like, the guy's on the show at seven o'clock, right?  Burt?  Eight o'clock.  Yeah.  Yeah, Burt, eight o'clock, so that's two hours. 
[00:18:30]  We know he's been on Rogan's podcast, we know he's been wherever else he's been, he's  got all these great stories, he's trying to tell the story about wrestling a bear for  two hours, and, like, even if you couldn't pull it, maybe somebody could have pulled  it on your behalf for After ONA Live, right?  This is great.  I'm glad I'm hosting this show, Sam.  I'm so aware now of the challenges you face.  Should have told, I told you, when I couldn't do it, but why would I have to tell somebody?  You're the one who wanted the bit.  After ONA Live comes on every day, After ONA.  We didn't know he wrestled a bear. 
[00:19:00]  So then, alright, then let's go down the list of some of the other things that on my show,  After ONA Live, I might want to play.  Do we have any of the Happy Days bits where, because Henry Winkler was in today and he actually  dropped the word delish, which was a pretty fucking surreal experience, but do we have  any Happy Days stuff?  I don't know.  Let me see.  Take a gander.  Eric pulled one bit today that I had to do with the show.  One?  One.  He was, remember when we were talking about Bob Kelly and the YouTube trailer? 
[00:19:30]  It looks so brief, though, right?  Yeah, but remember he looked young?  Yeah.  And somebody said that we had done that bit?  Yeah.  Eric pulled a bit of us talking about Bob Kelly when he was young.  That's it?  That's it.  We got one bit?  I've done the show with no bits.  Yeah, but you have Loverboy come in.  I've done the show.  I don't even have any guests.  Do I have any guests?  We can find you some guests.  Yeah, who you got laying around?  Michael Rappaport's around.  You want to talk to him?  Michael Rappaport?  If you have any guests in here, I might take the show over.  Yeah, he's not doing anything. 
[00:20:00]  That's not fair.  I know, but...  Like, I got nothing, and then if I get a guest, you're going to take over.  Well, I make do with nothing.  You don't even have a wheel.  This is fucked.  It's in the other room.  I make do with nothing.  All right, let's go back to the phones.  There's probably some people who are fans of management on the line now.  And I'll say this, too, for your information.  I've done the show with no guests, no phones, no bits.  What'd you do?  Entertained.  Yeah, you had the morning mashup in here.  Like, you just sucked your friends from the hall.  I can get to the morning mashup if you want.  Oh, God, no.  Well, look at this in the hallway. 
[00:20:30]  There's a Ron and Fez intern.  You just drag people in.  You make do.  All right, let's go to the phones.  Line one.  You're on with management after 0&A Live.  Rob Cross.  I think that you sound sexy and you're in management.  You want to ride in a big truck, little boy?  This is like when Mars hosted yesterday.  It's like people just call up and hit on dudes on this channel.  What happened?  What happened?  Didn't women used to take their tops off around here? 
[00:21:00]  It was much more of a hetero thing going on, but whatever.  All right, line two.  Line two.  That's why I don't go to the phones without a focus, do I?  No.  Well, my focus is accepting calls from people who are fans of management  or have constructive criticism of some sort.  Line two.  You're on after 0&A Live.  Is this a Dix Bigelow show with Rob Smith?  All right, let's go to line three.  It's got to get more constructive than that.  You're on after 0&A Live with management. 
[00:21:30]  Is this Rob the Q-Boy Cross?  The what?  Oh, Q-Boy.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I am a door.  Go ahead.  You should go down to a local university and find some college kids and intern them like  it's 1942 for 0&A.  I think it's 1942.  Yeah, so.  Buffering.  What's the 42 reference, Sandy?  Is that something?  World War II, Japanese people.  Intern them.  Oh, like internment.  Yeah.  Get them in there. 
[00:22:00]  That's awesome.  Coke Logic's on the phone.  Oh, Coke Logic's sweet.  Coke Logic, you're on after 0&A Live.  Hi, Rob.  Hi.  I'm a big fan of your animation, by the way.  And your frequent calls to special delivery.  Yes.  That's exactly what I wanted to talk about.  Don't you agree that it'd be much better to have three hours of special delivery and  one hour of Jason Ellis Best Of?  Kind of like live programming over pre-recorded Best Of material?  Well, I mean, I think that Jason Ellis runs a pretty interesting show and there's a lot 
[00:22:30]  of us who don't get to check it out very often.  Like me, I don't get to listen to it all the time because I'm listening to the virus.  So for me, it's very helpful.  Like, to have Jason Ellis on from 6 to 8 p.m., I get to listen to it and, you know.  Oh, sure.  It's great to have as many different tastes in programming as possible, but I'm saying  two hours of replays versus what could be another hour of live programming.  I don't look at it as replays, Coke Logic.  I look at it as leveraging the company's assets for the benefit of the listener. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, he's originally...  I don't really look at it as that.  I just wanted to say leveraging assets.  He's on another channel.  He's on Raw Dog, isn't he?  All right, yeah.  Fair point, Coke Logic.  Let's go to line 5.  Okay.  You're on After ONA Live with fucking management.  Hey, Rob, I think you should take the remote mics and go to Times Square.  And listen to Cigars and Scotch on learn.tv at 7 p.m.  Oh, Cigars and Scotch plug.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Management sometimes is known to float an idea that's, you know, better on paper than in  execution, I guess, you know.  So, I mean, I think, you know, a good example of that is punching up the name of Line of  the Day.  That was, like, seemed like a decent enough idea.  And then, what did the Line of the Day end up becoming?  Something about suing the company?  We do have Line of the Day if you want to go to it.  Oh, have we not done that?  We didn't do that.  I have some material.  So, I have a Bob Kelly bit, and I have Line of the Day. 
[00:24:00]  Well, I'm going to say this.  I told everybody who's on the wheel that you're on the wheel.  I told you today you're on the wheel, right?  It's up to you to find material.  Nobody gives me material.  I went to find material earlier today.  What you do is you listen.  And it was not able to be generated.  You listen to the show, and then you think of things that we could expand on.  That's all I do.  And it works.  And you're awesome at it.  Thank you.  But I'm just going to rely on the phone, since I don't have any real material. 
[00:24:30]  Isn't that what talk show hosts do?  Yes.  All right, Line 4.  You're on with management on After One Live.  Okay.  Hey.  All right, go ahead.  Call her.  Hello?  Am I on the show?  Fuck yeah.  Is this Chuck Rose?  Yes.  Hey, this is Danny in the back office.  Danny, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, can I get a raise?  That's another action item.  That's been kicked upstairs.  Line 6. 
[00:25:00]  You're on After One Live with management.  All right.  All righty then.  Thank you for calling.  Line 1.  You're on the air with management.  I should have brought in an old air check.  I could have played that.  That's always good for some comedy.  I just suck on the air.  Yeah, go ahead.  You just said you don't have time to listen to Jason Ellis.  The guy's on the Starz channel, Starz 2, and the virus.  I mean, I've had enough already.  It's hard to find.  I've had a good show.  Until I can't hit a preset on my radio without hearing Jason Ellis, I don't think there's 
[00:25:30]  enough Jason Ellis on the platform.  Special delivery should be three to four hours of live, fresh, new content.  If we had an extra day in the week, I would do a seven-hour special delivery.  I could do seven hours of that show.  No kidding aside, they got a really good show, Dr. Steve.  I'm tired of Jason Ellis on three channels.  Enough already.  What am I paying for?  All right, line two.  I'm going to hear Saturday.  Line two, these are not fans of management.  I thought at least there'd be one fan of management. 
[00:26:00]  Fuck.  All right, line two.  You're on afternoon a lot.  Yo, guys.  Yo.  Hey, I just want to send a shout out to the post-live room on Pal Talk.  We're the motherfucking shit.  And man, it sucks.  Oh, jeez.  Your mom's box.  Troy, why'd you roll in here?  Do you have some material?  There you go.  Did you cut something up?  Now you're working.  No, I just want to hang out.  Now you're working?  Because I brought another guy who came and sat down in front of a microphone on.  Yeah, I just want to hang out.  All right.  I don't want to make this easier for you, but if I were in your position, I'd expand 
[00:26:30]  on some of the things that are said about me on the air because you normally, this is  your voice.  Don't forget.  You have a voice now, and whereas you normally are spoken about, you have a voice that you  can say whatever you want.  There's Mark Zito.  You can drag him in.  I mean, so I could come in and I could say, I am not an idiot.  Yeah, exactly.  Give your side of the story.  Well, Opie did say that he does like Rob, right?  I mean, that was...  I don't think it was does like.  I think it was least not liked. 
[00:27:00]  Okay.  But whatever.  It's a step in the right direction, right?  Yes, I think so.  So why don't we just, in the interest of momentum, which is a great radio term, why don't we play  the one bit that we have pulled for today so that I can then reassess what material is  at my disposal?  But the phones are blowing up.  They love you.  They're all jammed.  Okay.  All right.  We'll take a couple more calls.  One more call.  No. 
[00:27:30]  Line two.  Okay.  You're on after on a line.  Okay.  There you go.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Or don't.  Let's go line three.  Do you like Blake Shelton?  Wow.  If you don't, you're in the ass.  That's got to be rolling.  I'm trying to figure out why he's got such a weird echo in his voice.  He sounds like...  I'm in the room.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that would do it.  Yeah, I do.  I love Blake Shelton.  Listen, I got a piece of material. 
[00:28:00]  I don't know where...  I honestly, God, don't know where this came from.  You saw it get handed to me just now, right?  Yes, but I don't know what's on that disc, so...  Do you want me to read you what it says?  Yeah, but that's helpful.  It may not even be helpful.  It says Chuck Ross Demo 121.  Like as in...  121.  121 seconds, yeah.  Awesome.  Where'd it come from?  I have no clue where they got this.  They found it in the office.  It's got to suck.  It's got to suck out loud.  Do you want it on now?  Yeah, fine.  Do you want to do line of the day?  All right.  Let's do...  Let's do... 
[00:28:30]  Set it up.  Explain Chuck Ross, what station, where this was from.  I don't know which station it's from.  Time period.  I don't know which station it's from.  Do we know?  Do we know what year?  I literally know everything I just told you.  If one of the guys who pulled it knows, they can come in, but...  121.01?  2001?  No, no, no.  That's the time.  One minute, 21 seconds.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know what era it's from.  It could be from Tucson, where I was a nighttime alternative rock jock.  How'd you get the name Chuck Ross?  It could be from LA.  My...  The woman who gave me a job in radio, I was hosting an alternative rock specialty show in that... 
[00:29:00]  I came out of college radio in the early 90s.  I was hosting an alternative rock specialty show, and this is interesting to no one.  But, since you asked, the woman who's putting me on the air is just to use my regular name.  She had a restraining order on three listeners, and she was really freaked out from an incident  that had happened, like, a couple of nights previous to that.  So she said, whatever you do, just don't use your real name.  These people are fucking insane.  And people in Arizona are literally fucking insane.  Like, gun-toting...  A lot of them are gun-toting maniacs.  So I just picked a stupid fucking name. 
[00:29:30]  And it was alternative rock, so, like, at that time, there were people named, like, Sluggo  and Jed the Fish, and Sharkboy, or...  So there wasn't anything behind the roast?  No, there's nothing behind it.  It was just...  I didn't think I was going to do radio for more than, like, six months or whatever.  I thought I'd just go to grad school or something.  That didn't happen.  Got stuck with it.  Anyway, let's...  We'll save that, and let's do line of the day.  One runner-up.  One runner-up?  There's a runner-up.  That's it?  That's a good one.  Yeah.  All right.  Who cuts line of the day?  How do we only have one runner-up? 
[00:30:00]  You're wasting time here.  Is time an issue?  Yeah, we gotta move it along.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Momentum.  All right, let's hear the runner-up.  Here's the first runner-up.  Can you dumb it down?  Chick it up for us.  Chick it up!  Yeah, there you go.  Chick it up for us.  I was watching The Grotty Kid the other day, and I thought to myself, do you think at any  point Daniel's mom was like, I think this janitor's trying to fuck my son?  They spend a lot of time together.  All right. 
[00:30:30]  All right, let's hear the actual line of the day.  Wait, do we want to guess?  Here comes something funny that was said on the show today, because we're here and live  and on a vacation.  Sue and the company.  I got a great idea.  10 o'clock.  Right.  We make a phone call to his office.  Yeah, I'm thinking about settling.  Come on down and see me.  And then we fucking run. 
[00:31:00]  We run to the elevator.  Yeah.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y.  Bill Tenley.  Where's that coming from?  You.  You know, not that that wasn't a great line of the day, but you got to admit, that setup  thing, that stager, I guess they call it on radio, it's pretty fucking hot, right?  Would that not have happened if it weren't for management?  It's true.  Fuck yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Fuck yeah.  All right, so do we want to do the demo now, or do we want to play the one bit we have lined  up?  No, let's do the demo.  Demo now?  Yeah.  Everyone's listening.  It's a point we're listening.  Then we have nothing to tease ahead to.  That's not my problem.  Zito, did you bring this demo in?  No.  Where the fuck did it come from?  I even know I had one online.  It came from the back office.  I know it came from the back office, but...  Mystery, man.  You're stalling.  No, let's do it then.  You want me to play it? 
[00:32:00]  Fuck yeah.  Tell me when you want me to pause it.  All right.  Hook up the Zircom wireless LAN module to your palm handheld.  Yeah, this is a voice demo.  This is from Los Angeles, like, in the early zeros.  And I took a class in commercial VO.  So this probably will suck.  So let's go.  Hook up the Zircom wireless LAN module to your palm handheld. 
[00:32:30]  You'll have high-speed access to network resources from anywhere on campus.  And wherever you go, you're connected.  It's like, move it along, grandma.  You're writing out-of-state checks for breath mints.  Fuck.  Who produced that?  It was produced in Burbank, California.  I can't remember who produced it.  I was taking voice classes with a woman who was really, really fucking good.  You'd never know by my VO, obviously.  Why would they keep the vocal in the song under your VO?  That doesn't make sense.  You know, that's just the way they did it. 
[00:33:00]  I mean...  Isn't that like a...  Like, now it seems pretty weird.  It was ten years ago, and it didn't seem all that weird.  It seems like a real no-no.  And I heard other demos done at the time, and it was fairly standard.  And then the thinking is that when you book a job, which I never did, because I did VO for, like, just a few months, and then, you know, I just dropped off doing it.  But then you'd replace, you know, the sample VO you did with actual commercial work.  So, yeah, you can keep going if you want.  You're connected.  It's like, move it along, Grandma.  You're writing out-of-state checks for breath mints. 
[00:33:30]  At Rubio's Baja Grill, we've got lobster burritos, lobster quesadillas, and lobster tacos.  And the tacos are only $1.99.  Tender, grilled lobster, guacamole, shredded cabbage, and salsa fresca, wrapped in a soft corn tortilla, and seasoned with our own Baja lobster salad.  Hungry, you rock?  Was this all one take?  Oh, no, that wasn't one take.  That was, it took me, I think, four days to do this.  I'm kidding.  It didn't take four days.  It took like a half hour.  I don't know how long it took. 
[00:34:00]  I read it, and somebody else produced it.  Keep going.  Sounds and seasoned with our own Baja lobster sauce.  Because skateboarding as you know it is now extinct.  Introducing X Games Skateboarding with eight pro skaters, 40 tricks, and signature moves.  Extreme!  Oh, God.  All right.  Is there any more?  X Games Skateboarding with eight pro skaters, 40 tricks, and signature moves, and a few hundred thousand screaming fans.  Oh, I get that most DJs sound like overbearing fake windbags. 
[00:34:30]  I hate those people.  By deciding to keep on...  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Truth in advertising?  Yeah.  I was talking about most, not me.  Oh.  Most.  I get that most DJs sound like overbearing fake windbags.  I hate those people.  By deciding to keep on listening, you've just demonstrated a key American freedom.  Choice.  And should you choose to turn it off, take a nap, or dye your hair blue, that's cool, too.  So take a second to celebrate all the little liberties you have. 
[00:35:00]  Or choose to take them for granted.  It's a free country.  Wait, stop it real quick.  Don't I sound like cool there?  Yeah.  Not really.  I don't think it's that bad.  I've heard a lot worse.  Yeah, there's some worse ones out there.  There's definitely much, much better ones out there.  I mean, I don't think it's horrible.  But in many months of trying, I never booked a job, so I guess the proof is in the lack of pay for this.  You can keep going if you want.  You two really are dynamic together.  Yeah.  It's a free country. 
[00:35:30]  Think you know, twisted?  Not until you've tried all new Slice.  It's orange soda with a wicked twist of lemon and lime.  Miller Lite.  Do they make Slice anymore?  In that same voice, can you say, you know what's between your legs, you know it well?  Oh, yeah.  You know what's between your legs.  It's not bad.  You know it well.  Orange soda with a wicked twist of lemon and lime.  Miller Lite.  Proud sponsor of the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's take calls if you want to hire me for VO.  Line one.  Oh, you're on After One A Live.  Bobby.  Hey.  Bobby.  What's going on, guys?  Yeah.  Hey.  Bob, do me favor.  Say hello to your brother Chris for me, would you, next time you talk to him?  Oh, God.  Right.  Line two.  Yeah.  Oh, hang on.  Hang on.  Line two.  You're on After One A Live.  Hey, Rob.  Yeah.  Yeah, a while ago, you asked the question, didn't girls used to take their tops off on 
[00:36:30]  this show?  Yeah.  Well, they used to, so management screwed it all up.  All right.  Ouch.  I guess I'll just sit here and get hit on by gay truckers then.  Line three.  You're on After One A Live.  Hey, Rob.  What's up, man?  What's up?  Listen, I totally agree with you.  I think it's easy for these guys to try and manage from the middle, where they're not  affected by the big decisions, the big things that go on in the company. 
[00:37:00]  You know, I'm a fan of management.  Yeah.  All right.  That was 43 minutes in.  All right.  I'm going to end that call there.  Line four.  That's it.  You're on After One A Live.  Hey, how's it going?  We're taking a management question.  Yeah, yeah.  How nervous does Eastside Dave make you as an employee?  Is that why you're in special delivery?  What?  Oh, no.  I wouldn't say Eastside Dave makes me terribly nervous as an employee.  What Eastside Dave does, and I'll take your, I'll respond to you off the line. 
[00:37:30]  You can hang up on him now.  What Eastside Dave does is like, I mean, it's fucking, yeah, it's tough to listen to sometimes  because, you know, you're thinking like, I mean, this is a man who, did he not shove  an R2-D2 toy in his rectum at some point?  He did.  Okay.  Like, did he not try to burn down Eric's wedding?  Yeah.  He did.  Like, literally, right?  Mm-hmm.  He said, we're going to burn this motherfucker down.  And then he, I think to quote him.  And then he acted on that.  Did he not?  Mm-hmm.  I mean, that makes you a little nervous, I guess, but that doesn't have any... 
[00:38:00]  Jesus Christ.  Look at these phone lines.  They're just lit up.  They're lit, Ronnie.  They love management.  And why did you, can I just say, because you called yourself a manager, and I hear you  on here and you seem like you're finally happy to be back on the air.  Why would someone turn their back from being one of the guys to being a shit-eating boss? 
[00:38:30]  I never understand that.  Why would anybody want to be a PD?  Um, you know what?  I like both of them.  I think being on the air is great, even though I probably could be a lot better at it.  Mm-hmm.  But, um, I like the program director part of it, too, because, I mean, somebody's got to  do it, and I think there's a lot of people who are very talented, who get to do, you know,  who are either on talk channels or who make music that doesn't get heard.  So you feel like you're helping the world? 
[00:39:00]  I don't feel like I'm helping the world.  I feel like there are people who go into programming for, um, you know, for different reasons than  I did, and I think one of the things I like about it is getting to work on stations like  this one, where you have shows like Rana Fez or Opie and Anthony that cover subject matter  that just doesn't get covered elsewhere, and can do things that other radio shows can't  do, and then, like, on music channels here, where you can play things that people don't  get to hear elsewhere.  All right, but let's just say in the case of Rana Fez and ONA. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  You didn't hire us.  No.  You weren't a part of the molding.  So you said to yourself, I need to find a young show out there.  That's what you're doing with a Dr. Steve, a special delivery.  That's where your mark's going to be made on this business.  Um, yeah, I mean, I think there are, there are occasions where making a mark is, um, in  that way, in finding talent.  What's the show?  And bringing it along.  What's going to be your legacy?  What show did you find?  Uh, I haven't found any talk shows yet. 
[00:40:00]  You know what?  I'll tell you this.  I will tell you this.  When I was at K-Rock, I did give Laszlo a show, and I thought he was fucking awesome.  Oh, Jesus Christ, no.  Laszlo, seriously.  That show is so fucking bad.  Laszlo's awesome.  No.  Laszlo is A, a racist.  B, a misogynist.  C, from what I can tell an adulterer, but I can't say that exactly, but there is going  to be a Linda Hogan book, uh, written about Laszlo.  Those things aside, he was pretty good.  Oh, yeah.  But besides that, yeah, he does know where all the cool games are, I guess. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  And he does like drops.  He's a tech-rofile.  He does.  What's that mean?  He fucks around with kids?  Tech-rofile?  Which one is that?  Like this pedophile.  Sim, I like you in the back seat here.  You're doing a lot better.  Ron, can I talk for a second?  Yeah.  I had no idea how hard this would be for me.  I've been sitting here.  This is the most difficult thing I've ever done.  Wait, wait, wait.  This one or Mars?  I wasn't here for Mars.  Mars fucking crushed.  I heard he did great.  Yeah.  Mars crushed.  A lot of people are still talking about him. 
[00:41:00]  What is so hard for you, Sam?  Because this is my show.  I thought of it.  I did it.  And then I took your advice and spun the wheel.  And just watching people come in and just destroy it is the hardest thing that's ever happened.  You didn't see how easy it is to be fucking cushioned in between mommy and daddy and having  a nice fucking nap like this one hour is for you.  What do you mean?  I mean, you're in between ONA and Ron and Fez.  Who couldn't do an hour there?  We could grab any fucking listener.  Maybe that's who we should be spinning the wheel with. 
[00:41:30]  But any listener could come in here and do this hour.  But they're destroying the hour.  Destroying like killing?  No.  I think Rob's fucking amazing.  Did I destroy the hour?  No.  It wasn't good.  It wasn't a good hour.  It wasn't a good hour, but I didn't destroy it.  He's just fucking opening up, explaining to us what...  He pulled the curtain back, explains what happens with management.  But like...  Fascinating.  If I did the hour that Rob just did, Rob would have to have a meeting with me.  Who has to meet with Rob?  You sit around and you act like fucking Rob is hard on you and Dave. 
[00:42:00]  I don't say it.  I see Rob as one of the fucking...  Having the loosest leashes in fucking radio.  Perhaps a little too loose.  Let talent be talent.  See?  I see.  That's a fucking hell of a thing they come up with.  Kinda.  Yeah, that's a good saying, right?  Where, you know what?  And Rob, I'm not going to tell you how to feel about special delivery, but to me, they're  the Linda Hogan's of radio where, I'm sorry, you're getting all the benefits and now  you're going to write a fucking mean book about it?  We didn't write a mean book.  What did you think of Linda Hogan in here today? 
[00:42:30]  I mean, she reflected her book well, which was, you know, she's taking credit for Hulk  Hogan's ripped up t-shirts.  How much does she need credit for?  Why didn't you fucking say that to her?  It's not my show.  Were you a little let down that the boys didn't light her up?  No, I know, you know, you gotta play the game there.  She's in here.  What's the game?  I don't understand.  What's the game?  You have to treat most people respectfully unless they start taking shots.  I mean, we rarely have a guest that comes in here respectfully and ends up getting chewed 
[00:43:00]  out.  So, you're on Linda Hogan's side?  I didn't say I'm on Linda Hogan's side, but I am saying that I can see where Opie and  Anthony have her in the studio and they can't exactly light her up.  I mean, they did ask her how big Hogan's dick was, which was a good question.  Well, that fucks with Hogan, not with her, though.  I mean, here's how I see her.  And tell me if I'm wrong, Rob, because I understand that you know women and this is your hour and  I don't want to get away.  You know, wait, before you get into this, Ron, the fucked up thing is I hear this happen 
[00:43:30]  all the time when, you know, when the music plays, you walk in the door and I'm like,  wait, Sam was hosting, oh, wait, no, Ron's hosting this motherfucker.  I was hosting this fucking show.  Then Sam was hosting it.  Then you walked in and it's like, that's how you fucking do radio.  That's why I like working on a channel like this.  It's like Ron comes in, he sits down, says three words, and five minutes later we look up  and he's hosting the show.  Well, if you want Ron to leave, just ask him.  Don't treat him like that.  You say it.  I'll fucking unbreak the glass.  That's what I'm saying.  You go back here to take your calls, Rob.  No, no, no.  That's what I'm unbreak the glass.  Ron and me set something up nice where we had this good crossover happening. 
[00:44:00]  And I pulled you back into it.  And I tried to say, you know, I tried to pull you into it.  I was trying to give you a compliment, though.  Shit.  Yes, there is such a thing called confidence.  And people can pick up.  People and dogs can pick up on it, Rob.  I'm not going to lie to you about that.  But sit up in that chair and fucking act like, yeah, I want to be in here.  Sorry, you were saying.  You don't want to yell.  That's top 40.  That's not you, Rob.  You're a fucking rock guy.  You're right.  Can I please take the show back tomorrow?  Do I have to keep the wheel going?  You've already run out of people, haven't you? 
[00:44:30]  No.  We have rolling.  There is no wheel, Ron.  There's no fucking wheel.  There's a wheel.  See, that was the point.  The point was it was supposed to be an exciting wheel.  That's what I'm saying.  There's a wheel.  Everybody heard the wheel.  You were told from day one to have a real wheel.  We got a wheel.  And why do you feel like this has now become like you're a heroin addict, that you need it back?  Well, because it was my show.  It's ONA's after show.  That was the fucking point.  Let's all hear the great fucking, you know, bits of ONA, which before people used to write to me. 
[00:45:00]  I'm really enjoying this.  Now they're like, Ron, fucking, you know, Sam is ruining the channel.  When is management going to step in?  And I'm like, I don't run the fucking channel.  I see what you're saying.  You have titans of radio and they're fucking great, best of material.  Why do you want to have some kids sitting there and fucking whine?  I understand, but that's Rob's decision to make.  I've gotten a lot of good feedback on the after show.  Especially shows where there aren't any bits.  First of all, you just said feedback.  You've gotten good feedback on this? 
[00:45:30]  Yes.  Feedback.  Maybe you need to have a fucking sit down with him.  Yeah.  But, you know, here it is.  Special delivery is a great show.  The Sam show is an awful show.  What's missing?  Dave.  Dave.  That's right.  Where's the talent?  Dave.  Dave.  It's Rob's show.  I don't want to sing.  It's on my show.  I thought you were talking about special delivery.  I'm sorry.  I wish you would do it every day.  I know you're a very busy man, Rob, but I'd love to have you in here every day.  Thank you, Ronnie.  Every day.  That's a big compliment. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  What are you wrapping up?  It's your time.  Oh.  All right.  We're into Ron and Fez.  So can I say Ron and Fez is coming up next?  Yes, you can.  All right.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  Do you have any guests today?  Yes, we do.  I don't know whether you're very familiar with a young hip-hop group out of the 90s called  Tribe Called Quest.  Wait.  Are you being serious?  Yeah.  Well, there's a documentary on them right now by the fine actor Michael Rappaport.  Tribe Called Quest is already furious about this.  I saw the documentary. 
[00:46:30]  I saw the documentary.  Tip is furious?  In particular, yes, he is.  It's fucking great.  It's like a true rock documentary finally done for the fucking hip-hoppers.  They've got their first great behind-the-scenes documentary.  I thought if Michael Rappaport was going to take the fucking camera, point it at his face,  and two hours later, you know, it would be done.  He's not on screen at all.  He gets access to these guys like you wouldn't believe.  Michael Rappaport's stopping in here today. 
[00:47:00]  I thought for a second you were going to say you had Q-tip in here.  It looks like that could happen if this goes well, Rob, if I don't fucking play Sam on this.  I've done good work here.  All right.  And will Frank Watson be back today?  No.  Frank Watson is back on the road trying to get other states to join in.  Were you a fan of Frank Watson?  I love Frank Watson.  Sam, what about you?  Big fan of Frank Watson.  Because he despises you.  Why? 
[00:47:30]  Why?  Listen to the dead air that he just leaves in there.  It's not my show anymore.  Then why are you even on mic?  You asked me a question.  You weren't even able to stay off fucking Rob's show.  I did draw Sam in, in his defense.  I might have used him as a little bit of a crutch.  So you don't need that, Rob.  I probably don't.  That's where you and the relationship that you have with the callers works out so well.  It really does.  Yeah, we have a rapport that's developed over 30 minutes together. 
[00:48:00]  Well, we're going from rapport to rap-a-port today.  Awesome.  Michael Rap-a-port.  Of course, Beautiful Girls.  One of your favorite movies of all times.  Love it.  True Romance, Zebra Head.  Great, great actor.  I think I play bands named after all these movies.  Not only that, but his father probably did the biggest turnaround in the history of New York radio  when he started the disco station in the 70s.  They were one of those worst-to-first stations. 
[00:48:30]  They were in last fucking place.  Was that 92?  Yes, Disco 92.  Yeah.  They went from not even existing to playing disco albums, the following book,  number one across the fucking boards.  That's his dad.  He's the program director.  He was the Rob Cross of his time.  Maybe we should get him.  What's Michael Rap-a-port's dad doing now?  He just put in a resume here.  I was going to say, maybe we should bring him on board the virus.  We need more managers. 
[00:49:00]  All right, Ron and Fez next.  Ron and Fez next on the virus.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next on the virus.  Thanks for joining us. </pre>
