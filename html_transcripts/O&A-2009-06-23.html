<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, featuring numerous guests and caller contributions.  The show began with Opie recounting his experience at the U.S. Open golf tournament, highlighting the significantly rowdier and more alcohol-fueled atmosphere compared to previous years, particularly the heckling directed at Tiger Woods and Fred Funk. This was contrasted with the more subdued crowds at international tournaments.  The discussion then shifted abruptly to divorce and alimony, fueled by Opie's own impending divorce.  Numerous callers shared their experiences with financially devastating divorce settlements, often using highly offensive language to express their frustration and anger at the perceived unfairness of the system.  Hulk Hogan's divorce was discussed at length, with callers detailing his wife's financial demands and lifestyle, alongside a played video clip of Hogan crying on a boat, unable to access his former home.  The hosts used vulgar terms and engaged in sexually explicit humor throughout this discussion.  The segment ended with a return to misogynistic commentary about women's golf.

The show continued with a discussion about dating preferences, focusing on Anthony Cumia's shift towards older women (25-27).  The conversation was laced with crude and sexually explicit language, centered on Anthony's reasons for this change,  attributing it to a decreased tolerance for the "drama" associated with younger women.  Studio guests Patrice O'Neal and Sam Roberts contributed to the conversation, offering their perspectives on dating, relationships, and media manipulation. Sam Roberts recounted how a CNBC interview about his phone switch was heavily edited, leading to a further discussion of media bias.  Perez Hilton's public altercation with Will.i.am was also briefly mentioned.

A substantial portion of the show focused on the physical altercation between Perez Hilton and Will.i.am, using Hilton's video blog as a reference point.  The hosts discussed the events leading to the assault, allegedly perpetrated by Will.i.am's manager, including Hilton's use of Twitter and his emotional response.  The hosts repeatedly used homophobic slurs and other offensive language while analyzing Hilton's behavior and provocative blogging style,  mentioning other celebrities like Fergie, Adam Sandler, Lindsay Lohan, and Lady Gaga, alongside the recent death of Ed McMahon and the potential for Todd Bridges' comeback.

The show then moved to cover the separation of John and Kate Gosselin, speculating on the reasons behind their split and the upcoming divorce and child custody battle.  The hosts used highly offensive language to describe Kate Gosselin.  This segment also included a detailed discussion of Donald Trump's temporary purchase of WWE's Monday Night Raw, analyzing the event as a staged power struggle using audio clips from the broadcast.  Guests during this segment included Penthouse Pet of the Year, Heather Vandevin, who discussed her work, recent breakup, and views on BDSM, and Jose from the Metal Channel, who expressed a foot fetish.  Sexually explicit conversations involving Vandevin, Jose, and the hosts dominated a significant portion of this segment.  A conflict between the hosts and a co-worker, Laney, regarding an uninvited guest was also mentioned.

The final segment featured Heather Vandevin and Laney, both contributing to a sexually explicit conversation filled with graphic details of sexual acts, preferences, and past experiences, including anecdotes about working in pornography and interactions with celebrities.  Laney also mentioned resolving a past conflict with someone named Kenny. The segment concluded with the guests promoting their work and social media.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I like that, Patrice.  Can I say that on the air?  They don't know when.  Yeah, that's true.  They don't know where.  We'll get into the big Patrice O'Neal 4th of July party in a little bit.  We're back live.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Greetings.  I'm the U.S. Open kid.  The U.S. Open kid.  I had to go to the U.S. Open yesterday. 
[00:00:30]  I just had to.  It was calling my name.  Huh?  Is that what they call you, U.S. Open kid?  Well, I've been to five.  I'll give you that, okay.  How many U.S. Opens have you been to, my friend?  None.  I've been to two at Bethpage, one at Winged Foot, or Winged Foot.  The one they did out there in the Hamptons, Shinnecock.  Shinnecock.  And I do believe, someone has to look this up.  I was very young, and I think I went to one in Rochester, New York. 
[00:01:00]  It was a golf tournament.  I think it was the U.S. Open.  Really?  I believe it might have been Oak Hill, if someone could look that up.  My fifth U.S. Open.  And God damn, has golf changed.  Oof, I was just, yeah, we were talking about that.  It's a lot different than the olden days when people stood there, shh, shh, all right, we're here on the 18th hole.  Yeah.  Now it's gotten really like Happy Gilmore. 
[00:01:30]  Well, Tiger changed the sport.  Yeah.  And now he's kind of a grumpy guy.  But there were apparently a lot of intoxicated people heckling the golfers.  Well, yeah.  They served beer, like you said, at 11 in the morning.  11 in the morning they're serving beer.  And there were people heckling.  How does golf get hecklers?  Well, what happened was you went through this too fast. 
[00:02:00]  It used to be an old guy sport.  Old guys out of shape with ponches and, you know, silly clothes that your grandpa was wearing.  Knickers.  And then Tiger comes along and makes the sport kind of hip.  So now it's younger guys that now spend half the time in the gym pumping up and stuff.  Yeah.  And it brought in the young crowds.  And, yeah.  And now they're beer drinking, golf loving animals.  Swilling beer and, yeah, taunting the golfers.  They were yelling at Tiger for having an umbrella. 
[00:02:30]  You know, a guy holds the umbrella over his head.  And they're, like, calling him a pussy and saying, suck it up.  You got your own video game.  Yeah.  Like, what does that have to do with not wanting to get wet?  I don't know.  In the rain.  And then what's his name?  Is it Jim Funk or Freddie Funk?  I think it's Freddie, right?  Whatever his name is.  There you go.  Oak Hill, 1989 U.S. Open.  I was there.  Wow.  Curtis Strange was the winner.  My first U.S. Open. 
[00:03:00]  And now I'm up to five.  Well, they were taunting him and calling him fuck.  Yeah.  As they're drunk.  Because his last name's Funk.  But they were like, hey, fuck.  Mm-hmm.  So they had to start stationing state troopers around these little bunches of guys holding the plastic cups full of beer to make sure they kept their yaps shut.  It was awesome, though, man.  I mean, you were kind of confused.  You were like, wait, this is a golf tournament?  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Is this golf?  What the fuck is this?  Is this wacky golf?  Well, there were four guys that took off.  I think there's a picture in the paper today.  Four guys took their shirts off and wrote out Phil's name across their chest like it's a football game.  But it's golf.  What the fuck is it?  It's golf.  But it's golf.  It's golf.  And for the people that weren't there, well, I guess if you don't care, then this doesn't matter at all.  But there was only one golfer they were rooting for yesterday.  Phil Mickelson.  Really?  That was it.  They didn't care about anyone else. 
[00:04:00]  Because Phil's wife's going in for a little breast cancer surgery.  Right, right.  Sympathy vote there a little bit, sure.  So he wanted to win the trophy for her, which is a little, I always find that a little weird.  Yeah.  Is that really going to help what they're going through?  I mean, it's tragic for that family.  A little distraction.  Right.  Perhaps.  But he almost pulled it off, but then he choked again.  That's why he can't be a big Phil guy.  I know.  He's frustrating.  He chokes all the time.  Was he two strokes down?  He was leading with, what, three or four to go and then kind of had another one of those mini collapses. 
[00:04:30]  A little meltdown.  Yeah, all he had to do was pretty much, you know, par his way in and he had a shot at winning the whole damn thing.  The pressure.  But man, it was a good time.  Good time.  Good time.  A lot of pressure.  Do you like watching golf in?  Yeah, the final day.  I'll tune in.  You know, see what's going on.  But, and only like the main events like that, like the Masters and things like that.  The majors.  The Open. 
[00:05:00]  And, yeah, I'm not going to sit there and watch some crappy fucking game.  And once you get the bitches out there, I'm not even getting close to the fucking, ooh, ooh.  I had to go to like the women's fucking.  Hell no.  Hell no.  But actually when I lived in Rochester, I think Corning, they have a big women's tournament every year.  And I had to work a couple of them when I was like sort of doing TV as well as radio.  So, I was kind of a scrub at those things. 
[00:05:30]  Hell no.  Yeah, there's just no excitement there.  What is it about that?  Like girls can do a sport that guys do and there's zero excitement.  Well, I guess not all sports, but definitely golf because the ball doesn't go as high.  They're consistent as hell.  Straight down the middle.  They hit their driver.  They hit their iron.  They chip up.  They putt.  Move on to the next hole.  No surprises.  Hell no.  No like holy shit moments. 
[00:06:00]  No, no.  Yeah, great.  But the guys, they're just, you know, because we're guys.  We take more chances.  They're going for it.  You know women?  Tin cup.  Women have to play it safe all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's kind of like Adam's.  I could go over that, but I'm going to lay up.  Right.  I'm going to just punch out and then I'll hit a nice easy wedge into the green and I'll one putt.  Yeah.  And the guys are like, dog leg, right?  I'm just going to hit it straight and then cut it instead of trying to go over the trees.  And then someone like Phil Mickelson looks at his caddy. 
[00:06:30]  I'm like, I see a one by one foot opening in the middle of that tree.  I'm going to go for that.  I'm going to go for it.  That's why.  That's the difference.  Women.  You want the ball to disappear and then wonder where the fuck it's going to land.  And then have it just go pop out back on the fairway.  You're like, yeah.  But you know what?  As far as caddying goes, which is the only other job I really ever had, you know, caddying for the ladies was the best thing ever.  Yeah.  Because you never lost their ball.  You knew it was straight down the middle.  Oh, easy.  You know, you never had to like split the fairway, go to this guy's ball way on the right, this guy's ball way on the left. 
[00:07:00]  All the hens are together in one spot, one spot right in the middle of the fairway.  Oh, you're up.  You're first.  Okay, we'll wait for you.  At Bethpage yesterday, we were real close to just seeing women just tear their shirts off.  It was a party going on.  Unbelievable how golf has just turned into that.  Yeah.  It was fun, though.  I had to go.  I had to go.  I had to go.  For you, I got that news. 
[00:07:30]  Let's see.  I called you personally.  Finally, Sunday night, we were having a big Father's Day shindig at the house.  And I got that call.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  I looked at my watch and was like, ah, I was starting to get a little worried that I'd have to cash in a little early.  Oh, because I hinted.  I said, I don't know.  I'm thinking of going to the U.S. Open.  I'm like, hell yeah.  You go, man.  Have fun. 
[00:08:00]  I'm like looking at another bottle of wine going, I could crack that bitch over now.  I'll be honest, man.  I probably should have went yesterday, but I was down in Philly for Father's Day for, you know, the girls' Father's Day thing.  Yeah.  And I just didn't feel like working yesterday.  I got to be honest with you.  And I had the tickets.  I'm like, you know what?  I don't really feel like doing radio tomorrow.  And I got U.S. Open tickets.  It's a perfect combination right here.  It was day after Father's Day and stuff, so a lot of people have little parties, get-togethers, whatever the hell it is. 
[00:08:30]  And that Father's Day thing is still a little weird for me.  Yeah.  Not as bad, though.  I mean, time heals all wounds.  So they say.  Time wounds all heals.  Right.  Oh, chimney cricket.  I went to a Phillies game while I was down there, though.  God damn, they have a nice park.  Yeah.  I would assume the Mets have a nice park, too, but I just can't get tickets yet.  I haven't been to shitty field yet.  But that fucking, where the Phillies are playing, man, damn, that is a nice park.  Didn't we go down there once?  Yeah.  We sat.  We were talking about that this past weekend when we were working for YSP. 
[00:09:00]  They gave us these amazing seats right above the Phillies' dugout.  What, four or five rows up?  Maybe ten rows?  No, no.  It was like four or five rows, right?  It was right there.  It was right there.  Perfect seats.  Just to put our stupid faces on the big screen and say, oh, look who's at the ballgame.  O.B. and Anthony from WISB.  What the people didn't see, as soon as we got the exposure on the big screen, some guy  who works for the Phillies organization is coming and taps us on the shoulder and goes, 
[00:09:30]  all right, guys, come on.  All right, come on.  What do you mean, come on?  We're watching the game.  And then what they do is they bring down the next idiots.  Yeah.  So you don't even get the seats for the whole game.  No.  So you had to walk up and we're like watching the game from underneath the fucking.  Yeah, like from a concession booth.  You know, if we were working for the WB, they wouldn't have kicked us out.  No.  You know, we see the celebrities at the baseball game.  You're like, okay, really?  Yeah.  They were forced to go to the game for a little exposure. 
[00:10:00]  Why are they sitting in O.B. and Anthony's seats?  In our case, if they gave us good seats, I'm like, I'll watch any baseball game, you know,  live like that.  Yeah.  Good seats.  Nice park.  So, yeah, right on.  So the U.S. Open was, was that?  Oh, it was Terry Funk.  Ah, Terry Funk.  Was it Terry Funk?  Isn't he a wrestler?  I'm not even going to look at Patrice.  Is he alive?  You don't know much about golf because we've talked about this.  Golf?  You're not a big golf fan, right? 
[00:10:30]  No.  That's why I ain't talking.  No, I know.  That's why I ain't talking.  I was just making sure.  Yeah, man.  Oh, and the other thing is everyone was.  Fred Funk.  It is Fred.  We said Freddy.  So why is this guy correcting us and saying back to Terry?  Because he's an idiot.  Terry Funk is a wrestler, right?  Yeah.  All right.  I knew that sounded familiar.  Yeah.  They were going, Fred, fuck.  Fred, fuck.  Yeah.  Fred, fuck.  It's like, it's fucking.  This is golf.  This is the sport of royalty. 
[00:11:00]  I don't know what the fuck it is.  They just love Phil Mickelson, though.  Yeah.  And I was just reading an article in, I think, Newsday, and he hung out afterwards and signed  autographs to the point where the troopers were like, they had to pull him away because  he was causing basically a riot.  Oh, really?  For like a half hour, he just signed anything for the fans.  He was the only guy.  Wow.  Tiger just looked for his big black car and he's out of there.  Gone.  He's had it.  Jesus.  He's not that fan friendly anymore.  No.  I don't think he ever was like a Phil Mickelson, but still like Tiger the best. 
[00:11:30]  A little humble.  He used to be a little more humble than he is now, I think.  Yeah.  Oh, and they were all yelling out their favorite golf lines for movies.  A lot of Caddyshack.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of Happy Gilmore.  A lot of Happy Gilmore lines.  Yeah.  The fans now yell out movie lines.  My brother was trying to start a fill it up chant.  Like fill it up.  For Phil Mickelson.  Oh, no. 
[00:12:00]  Stop.  And everyone, he would yell it when it was really quiet.  And everyone looked at him like, dude, that one ain't working.  I don't think that one's going to catch on.  No, that one ain't going to catch on.  Every time he hit it, fill it up.  And then these idiots that, like, you know, these guys are teeing off.  It's, what, 500 yards to the hole?  And they're yelling, go in the hole!  Yeah.  Go in the hole!  Get it all!  Get it all!  It's like, part five. 
[00:12:30]  Stop it.  Right.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, but you think that golf really has changed, or is it just a bunch of drunken white jackasses  from Long Island?  That was also something that was brought up.  A lot of people said that it was just because it's from Long Island that a lot of the white  trash idiots from Long Island, those guys, which I got to agree with.  I think, you know, it's a bunch of Lehman Brothers guys with severance back having nothing 
[00:13:00]  to fucking do, hanging out, getting drunk.  You know, John, I would like to defend the Long Islander being from there, but I think  that did play into it a bit, John.  I'm just saying.  Anyway, enjoy the day, guys.  All right, man.  Yeah, we do know Long Islanders better than anybody, having come from there.  So that probably did factor in a bunch of these dopes that you see at the bars every  so often.  I think the sport has definitely changed and got younger, but also, when these tournaments 
[00:13:30]  are played in the New York area in general, they get a little crazy, because I went up  to Wingfoot in 2006, and they were pretty rowdy up there as well.  But Beth Page takes a kick.  That's why they like going back there.  You know, they played in 2002.  They came back in 2009.  I don't think they really usually do that.  They try to spread it out a little more than that.  Let's go to Mongo the Trucker.  Mongo!  Hey, guys.  The other thing, too, is, I mean, it's only the U.S. audiences that are like that.  If you watch the British Open, or if they're playing over in, like, Saudi Arabia or one 
[00:14:00]  of the other courses, I mean, they're all polite, and they clap for every shot.  It's only us assholes here in the U.S. as they're shooting, you know, screaming shit.  That's true.  And they hit the ball.  Right.  Yeah, the little golf clap and stuff.  And here it's like, fucking A, brother, get in the fucking hole.  I hate watching the British Open.  The camera's a little further away, and it's always misty and cloudy, and just, it's like  soup in the air. 
[00:14:30]  Have not figured it out.  The fairways are less green.  The rough is more brown.  The sand traps are way deeper.  It just looks like a miserable place to play golf.  Don't take care of shit over there?  What's going on?  Well, that's why we left.  We needed to find nicer weather.  That's all.  That's all.  Weather sucks here.  Get a ship.  Talking about taxes, we said, you know what?  We need to find nicer weather.  This fucking rain soup shit is for the birds.  Although now, it seems we have England's weather, Opie.  Oh, my God. 
[00:15:00]  More rain.  I was disgusted.  I decided, screw it.  I cranked the pool up to about 92 degrees.  The meter spun off my house like a Frisbee.  You're nuts.  I cranked that thing up.  It was like bass water.  But wasn't 80 good enough, even in the rainy weather?  No.  Why?  90 is 10 more better.  True.  Than 80.  I like getting in a pool and not having that slight bit of going like, oh, oh, when it 
[00:15:30]  touches your sack.  Right.  When you're walking into the pool and it's like, okay, it's all right on my legs.  Oh, oh, oh.  My sack's in.  Once you get your sack under, then you got to get like your chest under and your shoulders  and then you get another, oh, oh.  I like just going, trudging in and going, ah, this is great.  It's like my bathtub.  That's fine.  But when summer finally hits, you'll turn the temperature back down, right?  Well, then the water will heat up naturally because the sun is blasting on the pool all 
[00:16:00]  day.  It's not like, I never understood that either.  Like people that put the pool in a shade, they put it underneath a bunch of trees.  First of all, leaves are falling in it.  Secondly, you're missing out on all the sunlight heating up the water.  Right.  So you go to someone's house, a pool fucking party and the goddamn water's freezing.  And then I went into the jacuzzi, which was now at, I think, 135 degrees.  It was boiling people's flesh off of them. 
[00:16:30]  I cannot get that hot enough.  And I'm crazy because I got this big remote control thing that like you hit buttons and  it says valves turning, valves turning.  I go to different modes and I'm always futzing with it.  That's too rich, man.  You shouldn't have a remote control for your jacuzzi.  You know why?  Because if I didn't, I would have to go over by the pumps and everything like that and  start spinning frigging levers.  This way I can hit it, it goes spa mode.  Boink, hit it and it goes valves turning.  And then once the valves turn, you see heater coming on. 
[00:17:00]  Patrice is disgusted.  You're not disgusted by this, Patrice?  I hope to one day enjoy this kind of life.  Oh, all right.  It's fantastic.  But it's just, that kind of shit breaks.  Well, it does.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, when it's working, it's great.  And I had steam coming off the pool that, I swear to you, and I've said it before, it  looked like that scene where, on Apocalypse Now.  It's not like a list where those, what's that shit where those mountains where there's,  they have monkeys and snow, but there's, it's like a lava pool right there. 
[00:17:30]  Unbelievable, man.  Looked like Apocalypse Now.  That shit sounds fucking fantastic.  Oh, it was great.  It's not for a married man either.  No, no, no.  If I get married, I'm not going to put none of that shit in my life.  No, you can't do that.  That's just taken away from you eventually.  That is fucking fantastic.  Some day, say, if you're married and you have that, just, if you're married and you have  that, just picture, because this will happen.  Some fucking young guy is going to be fucking your woman in that pool and jacuzzi, and you're 
[00:18:00]  going to be in a one-room apartment.  That is a single man.  Paying fucking shit.  It's a chick magnet.  Oh, it's beautiful.  It brings the women over, right, Ant?  Enough, yes.  Do you notice you get more women coming over to your place because of the pool?  Oh, jacuzzi thing.  What, what, are they coming over for me?  I'm out of here.  You doing something for the pool?  Am I delusional?  Do you have parties?  Yeah.  Like, seriously, like, sometimes there's no one at the house.  Other times, big parties at the house where the cops show up. 
[00:18:30]  That sounds so sexy, though, man, that heated, it's just nothing but a bunch of stuff  that girls can't fight.  Oh, it's like, oh, I can't, no.  Just better than their pride, you know, that shit is just.  I don't like this bathing suit on.  It's like, ooh, just fling that right off.  God.  Fling it off.  Has that happened?  Yeah, it's off.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look at you.  Oh, that's so amazing.  I think that shit is fucking, I can't even hate him, man.  That shit is dope, man.  He goes, oh, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  There's a lot of excess.  You know how you argue about what excess is too much?  Like, if you got enough money, it's like, you hear about guys with private planes.  And I think I argue with somebody, I said, it's all relative, man.  If you got the money to get a private plane.  Look, I'm the only one in this room that could totally appreciate what Ed just said, because  I know where he's been.  Oh, hell.  Hell and back.  I mean, we've all changed in the last 14 years or whatnot.  But man, you went from getting yelled at, because you didn't do the vacuuming before  you left to make a living. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  To young women taking their bathing suits off, because it's just in the way.  That's how it works now.  I was on a savings spree until probably two years ago.  And said, fuck it.  I just didn't spend a lot.  I bought some cool shit, but I didn't really spend.  And you never was a womanizer, right?  No.  You never went through that phase.  Mr. Monogamy.  Like, you went reverse.  Whatever.  I shouldn't call it reverse.  I call it, you call it like, you just live certain phases of your life before this  and that. 
[00:20:00]  So now it's like.  Monogamous relationships.  Damn.  Since I was like in my teens.  Fuck.  Just be like Mr. Fucking.  Yeah, I was like a married guy in high school.  You know, I'd have a girlfriend that was just like, yeah, we'd just be together forever.  Yeah, you did it like the wrong way.  Yeah.  You're supposed to do all that younger and then maybe settle in a little bit.  No.  Some people do that, though.  You know, but that's just some.  I think that is.  I'm glad I didn't.  That's tremendous, man.  That's just fucking.  I think I just get one of these young broads pregnant and then it's on. 
[00:20:30]  Get them pregnant.  No, that's the.  That's the whammy.  I mean.  All right.  Anthony's in the jacuzzi.  He's having fun.  Look at him.  Now they're barbecuing.  This is great.  Okay.  Now they're in the movie theater.  This is fantastic.  They're watching a movie.  This is good.  Okay.  Up to the bedroom.  Down.  Now back downstairs.  Oh, the bar.  The bar's open.  Anthony's.  Oh.  She's pregnant.  Oh, no.  He pushed that one a little too far, I think.  Well, like you said, man. 
[00:21:00]  Don't need that.  What happened?  You said, uh, just.  You see Hulk Hogan, man.  His fucking wife is just some young kid coming all over his.  Oh, yeah.  All over his fucking.  All over his fucking.  His white wrestling boots from Rocky 3.  His pinball machine.  He's just smashing.  He got his Hulk wig on.  That's why that Chris Rock line is brilliant about OJ.  Understanding what OJ did.  He's wiping his cum dick off on all of his bandanas that he wore on his head. 
[00:21:30]  Doing Hulk impressions of his fucking wife.  Oh, shit.  Oh, this is good pussy, brother.  And Hulk's like in a one-room fucking apartment.  Some good snatch, brother.  Took a picture on the wall of him at WrestleMania 1.  Ooh, yeah.  You know what?  That's fucking macho man and shit.  Wait a minute.  Oh, what's that shit from Rocky 3?  All my love slaves out there.  Yeah.  Thunder Lips is here in the flesh, baby.  Fucking his wife and in his house, man. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, in his house.  I don't watch the Brooke Hogan show, but I was turned on to a clip online where Hulk Hogan  picks up Brooke Hogan in a boat and they drive by the old place and they're right offshore  and the little yip-yip dogs are on the lawn.  There's like three or four of them and Brooke's like, basically goes, Daddy, pull over.  I want to go pet the dogs.  And Hulk goes, I'm not allowed.  I'm not allowed to be on the property.  I could get in a lot of trouble.  And his daughter's on his side, too. 
[00:22:30]  His daughter's on his side.  So this clip ends with the boat just offshore of this ridiculous house that's right on the  water down there.  That he bought with his wrestling money.  And the boat's just hanging out and they're just crying their eyes out.  Oh, no.  And man, I fell for the Hulkster.  The Hulkster.  How did he lose the house?  And then you have to sit there and go, why is the courts allowing this to happen?  That's what you got asked.  Because in the same episode, they showed Hulk's new house that he's kind of like either renting 
[00:23:00]  or just bought.  It's like a closet compared to what he was living in.  That's how it works.  They're fabulous.  I mean, it's a nice house, but it's not what he has to just, you know.  And you haven't seen the A&E story or behind the, whatever, what a true Hollywood story.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  His wife hit the lottery.  Like, she did not, what she did was pop out the kids for him.  So I guess when you say wah, wah, you make a point because all, she didn't, they didn't  struggle together. 
[00:23:30]  He was becoming Hulk right around when he met this bitch.  Right, right.  And she just was, he chose her.  She was there.  She said, cool.  And now she's fucking.  Yeah.  Now she's worth more money than him.  Or she has more stuff than him right now.  His house.  His house.  This house is ridiculous.  And he got in trouble for saying he's, he, he, he was going, he wanted to do an OJ, but  he, but he did it.  And it's like, what?  Are you serious?  Are you saying he can't think about?  Like, you can't think about that? 
[00:24:00]  Are you serious, man?  Of course.  After everything that she put him through.  Unbelievable.  Some young guy.  For not, for, for, for, for, for just hanging in there like a soldier through, through the,  the zillions and the, and the fucking, the, the accolades and the Hulkamania.  Mm-hmm.  Just fucking some guy in his house.  That's it.  And, and a boy.  What an insult.  And his, he got in trouble for, for fucking a girl that was his daughter's age. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But she's fucking a boy that's his daughter's age.  Is that the Hulkster's house right there?  Yeah, the house is just.  Look at that.  And yeah, you see the little gazebo at the end there?  Yeah, yeah.  The dogs were yip yipping over there and the boat was maybe 10, 15 feet away from that.  And he's like, I'm not allowed to step foot on the property.  Not allowed.  And it's his house.  It's his house.  He bought it.  Come on.  He took the bumps for that fucking money.  What is it going to take for the courts to understand how ridiculous that is? 
[00:25:00]  God.  It doesn't make sense.  No.  Not in this day and age.  But what do you think that, what do you think the concept is though?  I'm not one of these guys, you know, kick her to the curb and fuck her.  I, I do feel like the women, you know, need something.  Do they?  Yes, but not his house.  So what's the concept to why they would get so much?  What is the philosophical standpoint?  It goes way the fuck back to when women got married at fucking 15 in the old west.  It really does.  It goes back that fucking far where they had no marketable skills. 
[00:25:30]  They couldn't do anything except be a wife.  And then when they weren't the wife anymore, they were let out.  And what am I going to do?  So like, well, the guy's got to take care of her.  As opposed to what?  It's different now?  As opposed to now where it's like you bitch about wanting equal rights and no glass ceilings  in the corporate workplace and you're as powerful as men are.  Then go fuck yourself.  A divorce comes around, make your own fucking life.  Might be equal there too.  Pay your own fucking bills.  Get your own fucking house.  Yeah, Ant's almost done with his divorce.  Almost done. 
[00:26:00]  That's like a lifetime ago.  It's fucking close.  I barely remember what she looks like, Ant.  How long was you paying alimony?  Nine years.  It's only been nine years?  Only?  Only?  To me, it seems like fucking 18.  Let me tell you why it's, because I don't know what he could say.  You can't say only.  Never had a house.  No kids.  Didn't have anything.  And didn't own anything.  Nope.  Why nine years?  Didn't have shit.  Why nine years?  Why nine years?  I don't even understand if you have kids.  And did her money go up exponentially as your money went up? 
[00:26:30]  I can't give any details to the settlement.  That's not really details.  Yeah, it's financial details.  Is it really?  Yeah, yeah.  I can't divulge such things.  Wow.  So, you know.  This ain't a good.  This ain't good for my girl, man.  This shit ain't good for my girl, man.  She better hope she can sneak some mail.  Like, have something for the next seven years. 
[00:27:00]  Go check the mail.  Have mail sent to my house.  Right.  With her name on the motherfucker that I don't know about.  Yeah, some kind of established residency.  And that in seven years, she can get that common law bullshit.  Because I don't know.  No common law in New York.  No.  I live in Jersey.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  But there's no common law marriage in New York.  So you can stay with a bitch for 50 years.  That's it.  Doesn't matter.  So I think the time that's good should be a time she enjoys.  Yeah.  And after it's bad, I'm going to be living bad, hating you, but you're going to be still 
[00:27:30]  living the lifestyle.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  I wonder if I can sue for getting pussy.  Like, can I sue to get the pussy?  She gets to keep her lifestyle.  Can I just?  Can I have the pussy?  Let me go to George in New York.  George.  Hey.  What's up, George?  Listen, I just came back from Florida.  I've been divorced three years.  I sued.  Well, actually, I petitioned the court just so I could see my kids, have them enforce the 
[00:28:00]  visitation rights that are in the papers.  And the judge actually said that he couldn't enforce it.  If they don't want to see me, they can't see me.  But yes, I got to pay for the house.  Yeah.  I'm paying for the car.  I'm paying for the Alamo.  I got to pay her a thousand bucks a month for 10 fucking years.  And I can't even see my kids.  That's fantastic.  Isn't it great?  Fucking.  It's bullshit.  Archaic.  What is it going to take to turn this damn thing around? 
[00:28:30]  I mean, every time we go down this road, the phones get lit up by guys getting screwed  over.  Guys just getting fucked.  And even the women call up and go, yeah, I admit it's not fair.  And every once in a while, you got a woman that goes, yeah, well, guess what?  I'm getting fucked in the divorce.  Man, you're a rarity.  Yeah.  She's getting married.  I mean, the house that I have down in Florida is beautiful.  It's 4,400 square feet.  And this guy's sitting in my fucking living room watching the TV that I'm still fucking  paying for.  And then while she's getting married, I still got to pay her a thousand bucks a fucking 
[00:29:00]  month.  Sir, can I?  It's non-modifiable alimony.  Right, right.  Cash, a quick question.  What's your murder daydream?  Like your scenario?  How'd you kill him?  Just come on.  Just like in your daydream.  This is not incriminating, but how'd you do it?  Well, I'm not sure that it would kill her, but I know around Christmas time, they came  up and my kids are supposed to spend a week with me during the holidays.  She stayed 15 minutes away from me and wouldn't let me see the kids. 
[00:29:30]  I actually envisioned punching her in the face when my fist went through the back of  her head.  Nice.  Determinated.  And then put her clothes on and went to look for Sarah Connors.  Nice.  Good for you, George.  There is nothing more infuriating than getting fucked over by somebody that did nothing but  sit home and watch Oprah and the fucking Flintstones all day.  Nice.  Yeah, see?  You're absolutely right.  And they just allow it to happen.  It just continues to happen. 
[00:30:00]  Continues to happen.  Is there any fair women out there?  Like the logic?  Like, what is it?  Well, I could have been finding this wonderful lifestyle.  I could have been just standing around waiting for the lottery without you.  Like, there is no time that was wasted being her if she's living a lifestyle.  If she's living a lifestyle.  Yeah.  And now she gets to keep that lifestyle.  But they want to, yeah.  It's like, for some reason, they're allowed to have the lifestyle of which they're accustomed  to.  It's like, what is that? 
[00:30:30]  Where was the guarantee?  There's no guarantee with marriage.  You don't sign a guarantee certificate.  She sends in a warranty.  They don't offer you, well, if you'd like to pay an extra $22, we can have you hooked  up with the, whatever the fuck happens, you still get to lead this lifestyle.  That's fucking genius, man.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Let me fill that out.  Like you're buying a fucking television.  If the marriage breaks, you still get it back.  You get everything back.  Oh, okay.  I'll take that.  And mind you, this is supposed to be a union.  This is why it's bullshit. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Because I'll talk about it on stage sometime.  This shit is supposed to be a union in the eyes of God.  Right.  Like, so really.  Not a financial contract.  Why don't you do it in front of God and the priests when all it really is is a business  transaction.  A horrible business transaction.  And I talk to my girl and really all she really truly wants is a will.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, right now, if I get my shit together and write a will and just say, all right,  fuck it, I'm going to leave some shit to her, that would be marriage to her.  It's not even about, like, we are a union or this and that. 
[00:31:30]  It's just, I got to make sure that I get something out of my twat at the end of the  fucking rainbow.  Like, at the end of the rainbow, my twat is worth half your life, motherfucker.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me go to Mike.  Fuck on my bed, nigga.  Come on, so have some motherfucking stranger come on my thousand thread count sheets.  I'll kill you, bitch.  Damn, these motherfuckers, man.  Steve, do a search that says Hulk cries or something, because I know you're trying to 
[00:32:00]  find that clip of these guys.  That's so bad.  Mike in Boston.  Morning, boys.  What's up, Mike?  She is raking Hulk over the coals for $40,000 a month in pre-divorce alimony.  $40,000 a month.  Wow.  I'll say this much.  You know, I listen to you guys at night because I drive all night long.  Hampton Valley on Twitter.  Everybody knows who I am.  It's a half million a year. 
[00:32:30]  He goes on the show on Howard 101.  You know, he's best friends with Mr. Clem.  And he calls every week to tell everybody what's going on.  And she drags him to court once a month because she does not want to pay the Graziano family  the money that they want for Nick paralyzing their son.  She says that that's Hulk Hogan's problem because he signed Nick's license, not hers.  Jesus.  And this woman was a nail tech when...  She was a nail tech when they met? 
[00:33:00]  She was a nail tech.  I told her she ain't shit.  When she met Hulk Hogan.  And Hulk Hogan bought her parents' fair house in California.  Yeah.  He's paying her because I guess it's a Florida state law.  He's paying for her lawyers.  And she's been through three of them already.  Yeah, that's another one.  Hulk Hogan's going to have to come out of retirement.  Oh, God.  I am a real American.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  For real.  How is he going to make his money? 
[00:33:30]  Him and Ric Flair.  He's going to break his hip with the big leg drop.  Hulk Hogan.  He's going to have to kill himself.  Poor Hulk.  Poor Hulk.  Hulk Hogan.  Hulk Hogan.  This is bad.  This is so bad.  Does she realize, you know, this is not good, man?  No.  It's not good.  Oh, is that the clip?  All right.  Hold on.  We got the Hulk Hogan clip of him crying on the boat.  Look at this thing.  You ever had a cookie real quick? 
[00:34:00]  A little dog.  I can't pet cookie.  I can't pull up there.  Otherwise, your mom would have been put in jail.  I can't.  I can't pull up there.  I just want to pet her for a second.  Mommy, my love.  Look at her cookie.  Oh, my God.  He can't even look.  He can't even look at the house.  They pull away from the dogs.  They're barking.  Okay, Brooke Hogan starts crying, and then Hulk starts crying.  Hulkster.  This is a horrendous story.  Oh, she's crying, Dad.  He can't. 
[00:34:30]  I'm crying, brother.  I'm crying, brother.  Oh, God.  Poor Hulk.  Oh, look at his face.  He's just like.  Oh, shit, man.  He's just like.  Dad blows.  Do we have a better audio copy of that?  What?  The guy that Linda is dating is younger than Brooke.  Yeah.  He went to school with her.  Right.  He's actually younger than her, and she.  One of the.  Brooke knows best.  She was saying to one of her girlfriends as they're drinking this. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, Brooke still hasn't got over Charlie yet because I'm with him now,  and Brooke never wanted anything to do with Charlie to begin with.  Jesus.  That's the guy that's banging her.  Yeah, it's Charlie.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That's horrible.  The last time Hogan was in court with her was because she's at Hulk's house,  naturally, right there on the water in Miami.  She's throwing coke binge parties and booze.  Well, we don't know.  What kind of allegations are you making, sir? 
[00:35:30]  You could say.  Are you a madman?  You could say you're hearing that that might be going on, but.  Yeah, we don't.  Honestly, we don't know.  I mean, it has been rumored.  You know, I can tell you that much, but we don't know for sure.  And Brooke even alluded to some things.  If she gets caught, let's say that's the case.  If she gets caught doing that, will he, hopefully.  Yeah, he'll probably have to pay the coke bill.  Yeah, well, the lawyer says.  To fix her septum.  That's his whole thing right now.  He's trying to prove that she doesn't need $40,000 a month in pre-divorce alimony 
[00:36:00]  because she's just using it to give out candy to the children.  Amazing.  Good call, Mike.  Thank you.  I got it.  I got it.  All right.  I got E-Rock in studio.  E-Rock, what's up?  You're saying about how Hogan making his money, he doesn't even own his name or his trademarks  anymore.  He sold it to Eric Bischoff right before the divorce for like a dollar so that this way  she couldn't claim any of the royalties that he gets from the name and the trademarks.  Oh, so he cut off his nose to spite his face a little bit. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Wait, so what is Bischoff doing with it?  He's just sitting on it.  He collects all the royalty money for it, but he just sits on it until this thing's done  and then he sells it back to Hogan.  Oh, okay.  Well, that's pretty sweet.  Oh, they're that close, those two?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that's nice.  Unless he doesn't.  That's good to know.  You got a friend like that, but you got to make sure that friend doesn't get crazy on  you.  Yeah, there's all kinds of action figures and shit coming out.  He's just whoring his name around.  Dude, Perez Hilton got punched in the face, and man, am I laughing about this one.  That is hysterical. 
[00:37:00]  I am laughing about this one.  Didn't punch him hard enough.  Nope.  You're all brave talking your shit on the internet, and then someone calls you out on it, and  now you're going to cry like a little bitch.  He is a little bitch.  Oh, I love that he's crying.  Meh.  We'll get into that story after the break, probably, right?  Retard.  Retard.  Let me say hi to Jerry in Miami.  Jerry.  Hey.  All right.  Jerry.  If you want to listen to a horror divorce, my dad has turned 63, I believe, and my mom 
[00:37:30]  is 18 years younger.  She then divorces him right as he's about to retire.  He gets diagnosed with leukemia.  She takes him for everything because it's in Florida.  He has to pay for everything, so he loses pretty much everything.  Now all he has is the house.  He gets fired because of the stress he incurred during the divorce proceedings, so he can't  even retire now because he has no job, and he lost all his savings, and he still has  to pay for everything she's done, all her court costs, and he has to pay to maintain her lifestyle  in Florida while she fucks some other guy. 
[00:38:00]  Can you catch cancer like a vampire gives out, like, if he just bites that bitch on the  neck and just...  Yeah, wouldn't that be great?  ...just gives a cancer.  You know, we've been doing this break for about nine years ever since I started going  through this, and it's just amazing that it continues to happen.  Nothing changes.  Nothing changes.  Like, what is it going to take for the courts to realize that this is just ridiculously unfair  to the guy?  But is this messing...  Statistically, do you think this is fucking up women's... 
[00:38:30]  Like, less men are asking women to get married because of all of this nonsense?  No, it's just...  It continues.  It's just perpetuated.  The whole thing.  People still get married.  People still get divorced.  Guys still get fucked over.  I think what happens is you go, oh, my girl would never do that to me.  That's it.  Every one of these stories that's coming in today, I bet you every one of those guys  said, ah, when I...  If we asked him, the next one, we'll ask.  We'll ask. 
[00:39:00]  I asked my girl.  That goes back to the what's your wedding song.  Right.  What was your wedding song question?  You see your girl, you're in love, and this and that, and you're like, oh, she would never  do that to me.  I've heard the horror stories, but...  My girl puts...  You know, I come from the road, and if I'm sitting around on a Monday, she's trying to  get, you know, get my body back from me flying, I give her, you know, the check to put in  the bank, and, you know, I'm always looking at her funny like she's going to steal from  me.  So she'll take a picture of the deposit slipping. 
[00:39:30]  You can have a fake deposit slip.  Well, just so she...  She's photoshopping it.  She's like, I ain't steal your money, motherfucker.  I'm like, hell yeah, you goddamn bitch, you're going to steal my money.  And she takes a picture, she took a picture, and said, I fucking deposited the money.  You're like an NFL player on a Monday after a long weekend, right?  You said when you come off the road on a Monday, you're just done.  I'm done.  Like, I can't move, but I got a deposit of check.  You know, it's good. 
[00:40:00]  You know what it is?  It's good to feel like you can trust somebody to that high level, but you can't believe  at the end of the road that she...  But I can feel my girl, she's trying, she loves me, but she's trying to develop a certain  kind of hatred.  That's what they do.  They really try to.  So if after a while, if they succeed, then they can do this kind of shit to you.  Right, right, right.  But while they love you, it's hard for them to do that.  Of course it is.  So I'm sure Hulk's wife was a fucking trooper at some point, man.  I know she had his back. 
[00:40:30]  She gave him kids.  Which is fine.  And all that, but damn, how'd she turn into this evil bitch?  Like, it was something there, man.  She shouldn't be allowed to turn into an evil bitch.  The court system should step in and go, all right, fair is fair here.  This is ridiculous.  All that good shit goes right out the fucking window.  Like, the court should put into account that y'all build something like that.  This is a, like, one part, this is a build.  If you look at it like a building.  Yeah.  It's like you're taking what one person gave and somebody else's part is getting 
[00:41:00]  built stronger, but it's still a building.  You can't take away what the floors, it'll crumble.  So you've got to keep it intact some kind of way.  You think that the courts, and I've said this before, you think that the courts are this  thing you see on television and movies where you can race in and go like, your honor,  I have new evidence that shows that, no, with divorce cases, it's a slide rule.  The fucking judge sits there with, like, a fucking calculator and a slide rule. 
[00:41:30]  You're person A, she's person B, and they work a formula with this shit.  There's no telling the judge, you can't get up, your lawyer does all the talking.  I would have loved to have gotten up and said, your honor, can I just fucking talk to you  a minute, could I just explain to you what our situation is so you could look at this  on a more personal level and see what I was, what she was, how this happened, everything.  So it's just about a book kind of thing.  But no, the lawyers go with blah, blah, blah, blah, legal mumbo jumbo, blah, blah. 
[00:42:00]  Here's a fucking folder that's three feet thick that justifies my pay.  And here's this, and a clerk comes out.  Don't you have a better lawyer than she does?  Or you have to pay for her lawyer?  I got, yeah, yeah.  Or don't, shouldn't you have a better lawyer?  Oh, well, I should.  I went to.  That could have been one of the problems.  I went to, like, Bill's Discount House of Lawyers.  Oh, ha, ha, ha, you went to, you went to Sokoloff? 
[00:42:30]  I went to 1-800-CUNT.  If you were hurt in a triple fall accident, or if you're getting divorced, call us up.  Oh, well, that could have been one of the issues.  Binder and binder, the guy with the wacky hat.  I forget, this was pre-heated pool, man.  Right.  We were doing okay, but we weren't doing...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So it was just kind of like, well, now, you know, because the laws, a lot of times, yeah, the guy has to pay the girl's legal fees. 
[00:43:00]  So a lot of times the guy winds up paying for a better lawyer for the person that's fucking them.  So you're like, wait, wait, how does this work?  How does this work?  So it's not a fun thing.  It's not fair.  It's not just.  And I think until that is settled, I will never listen to some fucking bitch tell me that she needs, you know, equality in the workplace or any fucking where else. 
[00:43:30]  Until they work this divorce thing out, fuck you.  You're getting paid for doing nothing.  Then go fuck yourself.  Then make less on the workplace.  Make less.  Let us hang up nudie pictures and don't go to human resources.  All that shit comes into play because you fuck us over in the end.  This is the weird, the strange, the part of it that gets me to as a fucking misogynist and shit.  It's like.  Professional misogynist.  As a professional misogynist. 
[00:44:00]  It's like, okay, we're going to, we're going to be, and I'm sure you must have covered this shit at some point, but we're going to, we, we gangster now.  We're going to take, we're going to smash, we're going to kill like you motherfuckers.  And we're going to force you to relinquish what you really can do.  Like we're going to, we're going to take your madness out of the equation.  Exactly.  So you can't sock a bitch.  You can't fucking toss up, hang up out of, out the window by her feet.  No man physicality shit gone.  So now you're, the equal playing field is because men are surrendering madness and women get to be the bosses. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  But at the end of the day, if you slip and you be a man, they go back into woman mode.  Right.  Oh my Lordy Lord, how could you mode?  I'm helpless.  And, and, and then you get fucked over.  Yeah.  Cause they, so, so either we got to sit down to pee, which is what they're going to make us do now soon.  You're going to have to sit down to pee because they can't stand up to fucking piss.  Right. 
[00:45:00]  So everything that they're getting, man, is based on us going, okay.  And, and we still getting fucked at the end cause they get to be girls.  Yeah.  At the end of the fucking day, you get to be a girl.  They get to put on two personas, uh, based on what they need.  And you know what it's based on?  You know what it really at the end of the day is?  Here's what they're angry about at the end of the day.  And this is the thing.  I'm not fucking condoning any violence towards women.  I've never, never fucking hit a woman in my, in my life, but they, they, the thing they're still angry about is they can't jump higher and they can't beat a motherfucking arm wrestling and they can't open a fucking pickle jar and they can't reach the motherfucking rice up in the cabinet. 
[00:45:30]  That's at the end of the day, they suck as a creature.  I want to add to your list, bring it all the way around.  And they can't hit a, a driver, uh, 300 yards.  No.  See what I do right there?  That's it.  Brought it right around to the beginning of the show, my friends. 
[00:46:00]  It is what it is.  And that's why women's golf sucks.  Build girl golf courses.  You want to play on man, big giant Chinese girl wants to play with men.  Dude.  The worst man could beat her every single day.  Let me go, let me go real inside for the golf fans out there.  If the women played, uh, Beth page black, they would, they would throw their clubs down and get into the fetal position and cry.  That rape shower cry.  Yeah.  They wouldn't make it to the 18th hole.  They would, they would just lose their minds. 
[00:46:30]  But they'll change it for me and make it a par 46.  Well, yeah.  So they can fucking, so they can play better.  Well, there's the lady tees.  I know it's funny, but what does it mean?  It's going to be like, okay, I got to hit it 86 times.  So I'll get her.  She, an eagle will be, 16 shots will be eagle or whatever the fuck it is.  Yeah, we don't have, you don't have respect for women golfers.  No.  If your tee doesn't go past the, the, the women's tee, then you have to play the rest of your. 
[00:47:00]  They call it dick out.  Yeah.  You got to play the rest of the hole with your dick out.  Dick out.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone's done.  It's just funny to say.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, awkward.  You mean.  Ever played dick out?  You mean everyone else doesn't actually take their.  No, no.  It's like, ah, dick out, and you all laugh, and then you just tee off.  You take your mulligan.  Oh, but I love broads.  You take your mulligan.  I love you broads anyway.  Yeah, you love them. 
[00:47:30]  You do love them.  You do love them.  But it's just like you're a girl.  I argue all the time with my girl.  Bro, just be, you're cool if you figure out how to be cool as a girl.  Stop trying to be cool as me.  Historic data.  I love girls in the workplace where they're trying to be equal to us, but they're wearing  skirts and the cleavage is out and stuff.  I'm like, you're a girl.  In the end, you're just a girl.  Shut up.  Why?  Why?  You walk around looking all pretty and smell nice, and you're supposed to yell and scream  at us and tell us what to do, especially the women bosses. 
[00:48:00]  I'm like, shut up.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop, girl.  Women cops.  Some 5'2 cop with titties and a gun.  Pull over.  I don't feel like it.  Call your friends, because that's the only chance you got arrested me, bitch.  Unless you're stupid.  The women bosses, they're in their high heels.  They come marching down the hall in their high heels to teach you a lesson and scold you.  They're in their smart outfit with their smart little outfit on.  And you just go, and you just look at them and go, you know, you're just hilarious. 
[00:48:30]  You've got titties.  You want to give them a coochie-coo or something.  Shut up.  What is it, Beavis and Bennett?  Look, she's trying to be somebody.  You see a boss with a tie coming down the hall.  It's a different story.  You're like, oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  And that's what they're mad at, is ultimately everything.  It's, and again, I keep saying, me and my girl talk about all, because she really admires men, but at the same time, she just hates them. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  It's because naturally, they get no respect from, like, no matter what society does, all of this divorce shit, all that, it's still at the end of the day.  They're still angry because they need help.  Yeah, they need help.  From everybody, from us.  Yeah.  For them to feel, they don't feel comfortable being them because ultimately, if, look it, okay, first of all, we're talking America.  Mm-hmm.  Okay?  Oh, hell yeah.  Now, if we talk in these places where they have things called honor killing, where a motherfucker can kill his wife because she has bad breath. 
[00:49:30]  Like, we're talking, this is the society we're talking, we're talking America.  So if, if, if, if bitches out there will Google honor killing in Afghanistan and Pakistan and see how the bitches get treated out there.  Yeah.  Where they start scrapping, they, they bury a bitch up to her neck in dirt and then throw rocks at her head.  Throw rocks at her head.  And it's like, this, you in America is why you fucking yapping. 
[00:50:00]  What do you do, make a face?  Ultimately, can you imagine that, like, you can't think, it will never go to that here.  No.  But imagine if, if somebody just, if God came down and said, all right, America, here's how it's going to go.  Men can do what the fuck they want.  Goodbye.  Let's get some big fucking white bitch in the office talking about, did you just hear God?  Come here, bitch, I'm going to put you in this motherfucking cabinet.  I'm going to give this fat bitch a wedgie.  Can you imagine giving a fat bitch a wedgie?  Like, that's what I'm saying. 
[00:50:30]  And I'm, and again, this is not, oh, violence against, this is just, ladies, this is what we do when you're not around.  We laugh at you.  No matter what you do.  No matter what you do.  We're laughing and pointing at you.  I, uh, I, I have a history in the making, by the way.  What happened?  Anthony's pushing his demo up.  I'm pushing it up.  I'm going from 23 to 29 now. 
[00:51:00]  Smart move.  I'm pushing the demo up.  Oh, you mean you, yeah.  You don't have anyone in mind.  I'm going to give it 24, maybe.  You don't have anyone in mind, but you're moving your numbers up a little bit.  I'm just moving the numbers up.  The fucking, the, the, the.  Now that you're pushing.  18, 19, 20.  But now that you're pushing 55, that's not a bad idea.  It's 55.  19 is too young, man.  Jesus Christ.  It's too crazy.  Sounds like you want somebody to connect with, too, by the way.  This sounds like you're tired of.  Oh, shit.  He's, he's getting, he's, he's getting a little monogamy.  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[00:51:30]  You know, you know, I, I, I don't, I don't know.  I'm just, it's not so much what I'm looking for in the older demo.  Oh, look at me.  I'm cool.  And by older, I mean 22, 23.  It's what I'm not looking for in the younger.  Okay.  Because I can't fucking handle, uh, uh, drama and shit that comes out of their mouths like that.  Wait, you're really, like, bailing on the young?  And you're getting tired of pulling your dick out in this gray ball hair.  And you can just feel she's looking at it strained.  You can feel that she's sucking your old cock. 
[00:52:00]  Cause there's a, a heated pool in it for her.  That ain't even an issue, Patrice.  That isn't even, that isn't even coming to my mind.  You got some drama going on there?  What's going on with you that, that, that you've decided to move up the demo?  I'm just saying, I'm just stepping up the demo.  Just stepping up the demo.  Just, you know, I've noticed over time.  It's just, it just, how about you?  The bullshit ratio. 
[00:52:30]  I did the mathematics and the bullshit ratio.  It out, it starts to tip the scales outweighs the, the pussy ratio.  What?  And what would be the perfect age for you right now?  Yeah, for real.  I would say, I, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Cause I know you could easily go for the joke here.  Look, young, young girl comes.  Oh, I'm not talking about that.  Just the perfect age for you right now.  Everything.  Can I have a spread? 
[00:53:00]  Everything considered.  No, everything considered.  I would, I would spread it out.  Give me a, give me a three year, like, like 24, 25, 26.  25, 26, 27.  Really?  Yeah.  That's still too young, man.  No.  You know what?  Dude.  No.  Patrice, let it be.  Our Anthony's growing up a little bit.  Okay.  If we asked that question a year ago, he probably would have said 18, 19, 20.  Fucking 15, 16, 17.  25, 26, 27. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  25, 26, 27.  Wow.  That pretty much is fitting in there.  The truth will accept that.  Trust me.  Let me ask you, though.  It's just crazy.  Okay.  Just, I'm curious.  Yeah.  18, 19, 20.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Are you getting them off the basis that you're Anthony Cumia, or are you getting them because  you're the A of the O and A?  Do you understand what I'm saying?  So, are you, you just meet these young bitches and go, hey, how you doing, baby?  And they liking you like that? 
[00:54:00]  I think a lot of it has to do with, you know, I'm on the radio.  Familiarity.  Okay.  I'm not stupid.  I'm not stupid.  Yeah.  But, you know, I'm just asking.  Hold on.  But the Anthony Cumia plays into it.  But then you got to, you know.  The guy's a smooth motherfucker when he's on the radio.  You got to make it work.  I'm not.  Don't get me wrong.  This question is like, I'm saying, look.  I get what you're saying.  You know, it's like the fact that you absolutely, I'm not saying that you can't.  No, the A from O and A brings them to the ballpark, but the Anthony Cumia. 
[00:54:30]  But Anthony has to keep them out of the seats.  Anthony Cumia knows how to hit 400-foot home runs, my friend.  You got to keep the asses in the seats.  Oh, yeah.  You got to keep them in there.  You have a boring game.  They're going to fucking leave the stadium.  Fair enough, man.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's just too much crappy fucking bullshit.  Are you growing up?  Are you?  No.  He's getting tired.  He's getting tired of.  He's getting tired.  He's getting tired.  It's too much like.  And you're going to get tired of 25-year-olds, too. 
[00:55:00]  You're going to have to push 30.  I'm going to be like, you know, 55, 56, 57.  That, to me, is the perfect day.  29 and a half.  Are you single?  Yeah.  Anthony is a single man.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a single guy.  29 and a half.  Because 30 is getting old.  There's some very hot 30-year-olds out there.  30 is not old.  That's not old.  A lot of girls think they're getting old at that point.  30 is not old, bro.  That's Patrice is making faces. 
[00:55:30]  It's a weird number, but when you see 30-year-olds walking around, then they're not old.  No, you got to go.  I'm not even close to it.  Not in terms of a partner, but in terms of a twat factor.  A twat factor?  What the fuck?  18, 19, 20, 20.  In the 20s.  25, 23 is a delicious age.  Because that's all woman, but still young.  Yeah, but now there's the other part of that, which is the... 
[00:56:00]  Shut it!  But you know what, though?  I'm at the thing where, like, I don't...  Like, fucking is not priority one anymore where there's things you'll deal with.  After a while, you just go...  You know how to tell a bitch how to shut the fuck up after...  A young bitch, you'd be like, you know, shut up.  But we're missing something here.  We passed by way too fast.  Like, what are you sick of, man? 
[00:56:30]  You said the drama, but what?  Yeah, yeah.  There's always some kind of drama thing with younger girls.  Like stuff you could give a shit about?  Like gossip?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All that kind of garbage that goes on as, you know...  Tired of it?  Ah, ah.  Enough.  What is it?  I don't care.  I don't want to, you know...  Yapping?  Yeah, just that.  They all...  No, it's not even...  No, it's like getting involved in shit. 
[00:57:00]  Getting involved in shit.  No, no.  I'm just being vague, but believe me, there's reasons for it.  Just be easy going.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They don't know how.  They'll never know how.  Just be easy going without any of that.  You might as well stay at 20 and...  Of course, shit.  ...and teach them.  This is breaking news.  You have no idea.  Ann has moved up his demo.  To 25, 26, 27?  That's where I am now.  No, he went higher than that.  His ideal age would be that, but he would go all the way up to what?  You said 29?  Yeah, I...  Don't go 29, though.  No?  Why? 
[00:57:30]  Because that's a year of, oh my God, I'm going to be 30 soon.  So you have a whole...  They start losing their fucking minds?  So cut it off at 28.  28 is a good...  Because then...  Yeah?  Because it happens to all of us when we hit 29.  29 is the biggest waste of a year ever because the entire time you're 29, you're like, oh my God, I'm going to be 30.  That's all you think about.  That's true.  And then 30 hits and you're like, what the fuck was I doing?  You know?  So 40 doesn't have a chance?  No. 
[00:58:00]  No matter what she looked like.  There's plenty of time for 40.  Dude, my...  No.  My sister set me up...  No.  My sister set me up with a 40-year-old.  It was the most foreign thing ever.  And she was nice enough.  She was put together.  All that stuff.  I could relate better with the yappy...  And my sister...  Did I ever tell you this story?  No.  When I was single, my sister was working at a golf course.  And she knows I like golf.  She goes, there's this really beautiful woman that comes in with her friends.  They play golf every Tuesday. 
[00:58:30]  Then they come to the bar.  And I think she's perfect for you.  So she doesn't really tell me how old she is.  And she sets me up on a blind date.  So I'm at Crab Metal Golf Course.  The go-to course.  And I play there a few times.  And I'm on the putting green.  And I see this girl walking up to the putting green looking like she's on the women's tour.  Like the perfect golf outfit.  And she might as well have been from another fucking country.  I didn't know how to relate to her, talk to her. 
[00:59:00]  How do you talk to that?  I didn't know shit.  We're immature by nature.  You're with us.  We're immature by nature.  We're immature by nature here.  We're shallow.  We are shallow.  Yeah.  But Ant makes a good point.  I never grew up.  Ant never grew up.  No.  So even though, yeah, we are older, like, I stopped relating to women my age when I  was, fuck, man, 28.  Yeah.  I just stopped relating to them.  They were in a whole different world that I could not relate to. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  And then if you're talking women in their 40s, now they're fucking, you go on a date with  them, they're placing fucking ovulation kits on the fucking table.  It's their last chance.  Fucking turkey basters.  Could you come in this?  I want a baby.  Can you come in this?  Fuck that.  Can you come in this?  Come in this, please.  Can you come in this?  Oh.  Oh.  And the woman.  God damn it.  God damn it.  And the woman was nice enough.  We met.  We shook hands.  Her handshake was firm.  I bet it was. 
[01:00:00]  And then it was a firm handshake.  And I'm like, and all of a sudden my phone rings and it's my sister.  She goes, well, what do you, because she was waiting all day.  She couldn't wait.  Well.  What do you think?  What do you think?  And all I went, I turned away from the girl and I go, Holly, I'm going to.  I'm going to kill you.  So is that good?  And then I was stuck walking 18 holes with her doing chit chat.  And then I walked her to her car.  She had a brand new BMW.  She's got her own fucking thing going on.  What if she just did what an old lady's supposed to do is just go, look, man, let me give you 
[01:00:30]  some pussy first.  Have you ever seen gray pussy hair in your life?  Hell no.  Have you ever seen gray pussy hair?  Oh, fuck no.  I seen gray pussy hair about 10 years ago.  And I almost faint.  It just.  Did it horrify you?  It was, it was, it was, it was poking up coarse, um, like there was the regular pussy hair  and then the gray hair was just popping up, you know, gray hair, just boing.  And I'm just saying, this is old pussy, man. 
[01:01:00]  And, and, and, but the only chance a 40 year old guy is that she meets you and goes, look,  let me fuck you before dinner.  Like as you get older, it reversed.  Like the bitch has to call you on a date.  Okay.  I'd like to take you on a date.  Suck your dick.  And then let's go to.  And then maybe we can catch something to eat.  Let's go to TGI Friday.  She, she was nice and, and she was, she was, she was good looking and all that.  But I was thinking to myself, I, you know, I, I want a family and here's a 40 year old. 
[01:01:30]  And I'm like, man, even on the, even if this was to work out, this would be on the fast  track to, all right, do you love me after, after a week?  I got no time.  I have no time to be wasting my friend.  Let's get married by December and let's have our first kid, you know, by this time next  year.  Like there was no time to just kind of relax.  They got no time for investments.  Nope.  A 40 year old bitch can't invest.  Come on.  Let's move.  Move along.  Marriage.  Come on.  We're married. 
[01:02:00]  We're having kids.  What are we doing?  Me and my girl just had a, yesterday talking about kids.  Cause she's asking me, do you want to have kids?  I mean, she, we love each other.  You're going to have one.  She don't, she has a kid already, but then we're talking like, she's like, well, I don't  know if I want to have one.  And she says, do you want to have one?  I said, maybe.  And I just joke.  And I go, Hey, you know, I'll just, you know, just, I'll just shoot one off in a, in a 22  year old or something.  Have her take care of the kid.  She's like, well, what about, um, what was they call that?  Fucking I take my egg and then you take your Sprite. 
[01:02:30]  I said, well, nah, I want to fuck the bitch.  Can't you just put your egg in her and I can still fuck her.  And then maybe I can fertilize your egg in her.  Like I still want to get a little something out of her.  I wanted to get that young pussy.  You're talking about a surrogate mother, a surrogate moms.  But I'm like, nah, I'm just going to get a young bitch pregnant.  And she has a kid, but she has a kid from another guy.  But she, I mean, your girl really loves you.  So I would assume she would want to have a kid with you. 
[01:03:00]  Where it's your kid.  You guys made this.  But I love her kid as if the kid is mine.  Right.  And her kid is half of another guy's, you know, sack.  How old's the kid?  You barely talk about her on the show.  Well, she's a kid, you know, cause I'm an asshole.  I don't want to talk about the kid, but she's, the kid's 10.  But I met her when she was, I think, I think four.  And I mean, the kid loves me too.  So the kid, but the father's around.  He's not an absentee father.  They just not together.  Is he a good guy? 
[01:03:30]  I never met him.  Oh, okay.  But he's, but her kid, his kid's daughter loves him.  So he's a good guy.  Right.  And I'm like, well, you got a kid by another guy.  She said, but we weren't together.  And I'm like, whatever it doesn't make.  Let me pop this chick.  Get her pregnant.  And you love half my kid like I love half your kid and shit.  You know what?  I like the logic.  It's not, it's not bad.  You know what I mean?  But it's like, it's like that.  You get, the moral of the story is a guy, and this is one of the things I talk about. 
[01:04:00]  I never met my father, but I'm not angry because I know what sperm, sperm means nothing.  So I could have been down a tub drain as easy as I'm alive.  Right.  So as men go, there's nothing precious about the life cycle.  We can shoot some sperm as long as it's swimming in anything. 
[01:04:30]  To women, it's drama.  Oh my God, I'm 40.  I can't have a kid.  The eggs?  Right.  We just go, whatever, bitch.  Here's a load.  Do what you gotta do with it.  When you start thinking about where you've left your sperm, you realize how useless that  shit is.  It doesn't mean anything.  It doesn't mean anything.  Don't treat fucking old motor oil that you take out of your car with more care than your  own fucking sperm.  It's just.  I've left it in horrific places.  Yeah.  It's useless.  Just on the side of buildings and just wherever the fuck. 
[01:05:00]  Every egg is precious.  The bitches are crazy.  Right.  They go from their 20s to their 40s going, oh my God, my biological god.  Guys are like, where is this?  I need more nut coming out.  Just like those dumb penguins just watching over that stupid egg.  Oh, that egg.  That's how valuable the eggs are to the women.  And us, man.  And we don't.  We're leaking sperm right now as we talk.  All sperm is to us is, ah!  Just ends up.  Sperm equals, ugh!  Treat it like snot. 
[01:05:30]  Just wrapped up in a tissue and thrown in the fucking garbage.  I want to have a child with you, sweetie.  I love you with all my heart, and I think I want to have a family with you.  Fuck that.  On the titties.  That's much better.  On her nose.  There you go.  We can make a kid, or I can just lay this on your ass.  It's either love and commitment, or right on your fucking left cheek.  It's just a fucking split-second decision between life forever with this wonderful woman I love, 
[01:06:00]  and here, you dirty, stinking-ass bitch.  Take this, you fucking tramp.  I'll wipe you down, and then I'm going to sleep.  Either or.  And we don't.  It's a fucking crying shame.  And this conversation is why.  And I don't get mad that women really do hate us.  They should.  Because they can't even laugh about that shit.  No.  That eggs are precious. 
[01:06:30]  Precious.  Precious, man.  That's funny shit.  We got to take our first break.  We're really late.  I called Sam down here because we got some John and Kate breaking news.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do it after the break.  Okay.  And are you getting the Perez Hilton thing?  I got it if you want it.  Him crying like a bitch?  Yeah, I watched that too.  Biatch.  Look, if you're going to run a website like he runs, you know what?  Yeah.  You know, take it like a man, you little pussy.  That's your consequences.  That's right.  You're going to run a fucking website.  Don't call it your name.  He got punched in the face, and then he Twittered that he needed a cop and all this shit. 
[01:07:00]  We'll get into it.  Him and Will.i.am are beefing.  I'm not playing this like everyone else.  I'm glad this fucker got punched in the face.  Oh, yeah.  The shit he said on his website.  Take it like a man.  Boom, boom, pow.  He got a boom, boom, pow.  That's right, Tim.  Boom, boom, pow.  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony and Patrice O'Neal.  Oh!  Oh!  Thank you.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  Yes, sir.  Big Mama Prods.  And I've been doing okay with the Twitter, and I've been giving a little this and all that. 
[01:07:30]  And capitalize that shit, because that's how you find Patrice.  For some reason, if you don't capitalize, every letter in Big Mama Prods, you don't pop up.  I'm going to fix that if that's the case.  Yeah, good luck.  All right, now we go to break.  Opie and Anthony.  Lust for life.  Opie and Anthony, on your radio dog. 
[01:08:00]  On your radio dog.  Wah, wah, wah.  To Perez Hilton.  Shut up.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Baby, stick your head in grave.  Patrice O'Neal is in studio, and he's going to be playing the Houston Improv.  God damn!  Friday, Patrice, you're on the road again.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Houston Improv.  Highly, highly recommend you see Patrice O'Neal.  Thank you.  I was at Comics right after you were, doing a little something-something. 
[01:08:30]  Man, they were praising you.  They love you down there at Comics.  I love Comics, man.  I mean, the club themselves, they're like, man, he brings the people, he brings the funny.  We love having them.  It's a fun time, man.  I like it over there.  And Comics is a great club here in New York City.  But whatever.  For the people in the Houston area, Houston Improv, Patrice O'Neal, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  We got Sam in studio because we got a lot of pop culture type things, and Sam's kind of becoming the pop culture guy for the show. 
[01:09:00]  But I need your help, Ant.  We could go John and Kate and the news that shocked the world last night.  Did it really shock anybody?  We got Perez Hilton shit, and we got Sam and him being misused on CNBC.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, that was a big story.  I think we should push this out there.  I saw that on the news.  To our media friends that listen to the Opie and Anthony show, we want your help.  We want to push this out there. 
[01:09:30]  I knew it was all crap when I saw it.  I'm being manipulated by the media.  You were?  Well, they do this all the time, and we finally caught them.  We did a whole thing on the iPhone.  You got yours, right?  You got the 3G thing in?  Yes.  And you're loving it?  3GS.  3GS.  Picked it up.  I'm loving the hell out of it.  The video's great.  If you've noticed, I Twittered a couple of videos over the weekend.  Nice.  Yeah, and it's very clear.  You can Twit videos. 
[01:10:00]  Hell fucking yeah.  On what?  Twitvideo.com?  Twat.  Twit.  Twatty twit.  I think it's Twatty twit.  I'm using an app that is called...  Let me tell you the app I'm using.  All right.  I'm using Twitlator.  Twitlator.  That's what I'm using for the pictures.  But then I use Tweety for everything else.  Now, Twitterly...  Twitlator.  Twitlator.  Over 100 MBs on your videos?  That's what I need to know. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, fuck yeah.  Really?  I put some pretty bulky vids up.  Yeah, but I mean, with a phone vid, you know, you'd be surprised how long the videos could  be before you use up your 100 MB.  Yeah.  I need to know.  This is pretty clear.  Pretty clear.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know something?  You gotta download it and see what the size is.  What's the best feature of the new 3G?  Best feature...  Is the video?  ...is the camera itself.  The video and the still camera.  How many pics?  Does it have a flash yet?  No flash.  Don't need no fucking flash. 
[01:11:00]  How many megapix?  I can adjust everything on this.  Brightness.  How many megapix?  Better not be over my 3.2.  I think I'm 3.5, right?  Oh, shit.  Not sure.  Might just be 3.  When's the new BlackBerry coming out?  I think it's 3.  This is only three months old, but I need a new one already.  I think it's 3.  You got a bold?  Ah, fuck that bold.  I got the new curve.  My guy said, don't go bold or storm when I got this.  Oh, fuck you, guy.  Because I got bold.  I got the bold.  It's great.  I can run the SiriusXM app. 
[01:11:30]  How is that app?  I was doing that over the weekend.  They gave me an iPhone to try out the SiriusXM app, and I just gave it to somebody.  I hope they didn't want it back.  Oops.  Except for a couple days.  Jeez, dude.  They gave it to me.  They're like, I know you're a BlackBerry guy, but this SiriusXM app is very exciting.  It's what, the number two free download or something?  It's prominently featured on the Apple site as one of the apps.  It's doing big numbers, even without Howard, by the way.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  And so the company goes, here's an iPhone.  We really want you to check out the iPhone, check out the SiriusXM app so you know what  you're talking about.  I'm like, yeah, I'll do that.  I went down to Philly, man.  I don't even know who has it.  They're not getting it back.  Are you shitting me, really?  For real.  What did they say, Sam?  You were there?  Yeah, they told you, if we gave you an iPhone for a couple days, would you test out the  app?  And then the impression would be to bring it back, I don't know, today, maybe?  Yeah, yeah, like one day.  Oh, well.  Like over the weekend, it was just something to... 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, hold on to it for a little bit.  When I go to Philly, they love free stuff down there, man.  Apparently so.  I met a guy at the Phillies game.  He's like a Miller Lite rep.  I go, well, you better get a pallet of beer over to my father-in-law's house immediately.  That's his beer of choice.  Get some kegs.  You're not a Miller Lite guy.  No.  You gotta be a Miller Lite guy.  Shit, that's right.  So if that guy's listening, you better get that pallet together.  They're waiting.  They're thirsty.  The SiriusXM app's good, though? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, the SiriusXM app is really good.  And there's just like a few small features that are really good on this.  Because they've improved a lot of their things, like the stock ticker and location.  I could do everything from here.  I'm not even going to lie to you.  I'm a little nervous right now, because you know I'm a BlackBerry guy.  Yeah.  But I've been talking about this new iPhone with people, and I'm a little nervous.  BlackBerry better step up their game a little bit.  People are digging the shit out of this right now. 
[01:13:30]  A little nervous.  Still no picture messaging.  Still, but that's not the phone's fault.  Wait, you don't have picture messaging still?  It's not the phone's fault.  I've been picture messaging for two years.  It's the stupid AT&T's fault.  Maybe three.  And let me tell you something.  At this point, I could video Twitter.  So what the fuck do I care if I get picture messaging?  I understand.  And I could email videos and pictures to people.  I know the text would be great.  I would like to be able to text and like, here's a picture.  But there's workarounds that aren't that big a hassle.  But you can email a picture. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  But you have to, what, go to the other site still or no?  No, I just go right here.  Like, I could email.  So you could take a picture of Patrice and email it immediately to somebody.  Here it is.  Here it is, Patrice.  I go click.  Patrice never smiles in pictures.  What's that about, Patrice?  Are you the angry black guy?  Now I take the Patrice picture.  I want one picture of you smiling.  I go email photo.  Oh, it's the grill.  There it is.  Now I go, oh, pee.  I got the bad grill down below.  Oh, I'm a lot sexier not smiling, man. 
[01:14:30]  You can smile with your lips closed.  I learned that one.  I look like a fucking dick.  You look like a fucking dick.  When I smile, I just don't have a good smile, man.  I always wonder why I couldn't get a picture of you, like, looking happy.  Not even smiling.  Just looking happy.  If I ever get famous and somebody has a picture of me smiling, it'll be worth something one  day.  Nice.  I don't smile in pictures.  Did you get it done, Ant?  See, too long.  I would have been done already. 
[01:15:00]  You would have been?  I would have been done.  I just took the picture.  I just took the goddamn picture.  Let me see.  I think it's sent.  I think it's there.  They're already checking out my mind that I took.  I think it's on yours.  When you sent it to me, I sent it to you.  I don't want a picture of fucking Patrice.  I wanted to show you how fast I could see it.  All right.  I want to see the quality, though.  Why you got to fuck with my self-esteem instead of an experiment?  Because I gave up on you a while ago.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Every time I make a video or a picture of you, it's like, God, this guy isn't this  angry. 
[01:15:30]  I got it.  Oh, there it is.  All right.  Come on.  That's pretty good.  Why can't it go full screen, though?  Tap it, maybe.  Tap it.  Oh, you don't tap the screen.  See, I can do this.  See, here's what I...  Let me show you a little thing about Patrice's picture here.  What do you mean I can't tap?  Look, I can tap.  You tap the shit out of that phone, and it ain't going to do anything, is it?  Nothing's happening.  See, here's what I can do.  See Patrice's picture?  Watch this.  Two fingers.  Oh, look how big Patrice is getting. 
[01:16:00]  Whoa.  Look at this.  Look at that.  And then look at this.  Oh, I go landscape mode.  Yeah, good for you.  Look, watch.  I go landscape mode.  I go back again.  Watch.  Landscape mode.  It didn't do shit.  Look, man.  No, turn your head sideways.  Oh, okay.  See?  That'll work.  At the end of the day, fucking app.  The iPhone is for teenage girls to have fun with.  Blackberry is for fucking businessmen. 
[01:16:30]  This is a fucking phone, right, Patrice?  This is a fucking phone, man.  This shit is for business.  Raise your blackberry in the air, brother.  Raise your blackberries, motherfucker.  That's right.  This shit's for business.  This is for functionality.  That's right.  All right, you corporate shield, man.  I'm into the arts, man.  This shit is for fun.  The iPhone, you can have for fun.  It's a toy.  This shit is business, man.  We're all business, right, Patrice?  Business.  Business.  To business.  Business. 
[01:17:00]  Sucking up the...  You can have 40 emails, and this will fucking just...  By the way, look what I do to...  Right off the server.  Look what I do to the Patrice picture.  What?  Delete.  Delete.  I ain't saying it nowhere.  Look how fast he delete.  Look how fast he deleted.  Watch.  Watch.  I want you to watch.  Delete.  Goodbye.  Delete.  I don't want another picture of you being an angry black man.  I told you why I...  Man, I don't...  I'm not angry.  I just don't smile.  How about an in-between shot?  He raised half his face. 
[01:17:30]  I got to practice a smile.  That's not good, man.  By the way, a million iPhones sold over the weekend.  Is that true, Ant?  Yeah, they really...  Is that a good number?  Killed.  In this economy?  A million of anything is good, obviously.  But were they expecting to sell even more than that?  No, I think with this economy, I think they're right on target there with that one.  I didn't stand on line.  I got to thank my friends there at the Roosevelt Field Mall.  You mean Evan didn't get it for you?  No, Evan did nothing for me.  Oh.  I had to go down there and I had a little buddy down there. 
[01:18:00]  Kind of...  I actually used my old iPhone to email him in the store.  And I was like, I'm on a line out here.  I said, if you could do anything about it, I'd appreciate it.  If not, I'll see you in about two hours.  And send.  And then there he was going, hey, boom.  Come here.  Come here.  Nice.  Yeah, hells yeah.  Well, speaking of the iPhone, on Friday, we sent Sam and Evan to try to get Anthony an iPhone.  Yeah.  Uh, it was a whole big deal.  Yeah.  A whole big thing.  And Sam got on CNBC. 
[01:18:30]  That's correct.  And this is the original clip.  I want to play for everybody.  And I want our media buddies to really, you know, listen closely.  Maybe the Breitbart people.  Yeah, we're talking to you, Breitbart.  Because, uh, the media does this all the time.  They misrepresent all the time.  And they cut up video to, to, to, to satisfy their, their angle on stuff.  Or the need for something.  Maybe they went out there.  They didn't get what they needed.  Right.  So they take other shit and cut it up and make it what they needed.  So here's the original clip of Sam carrying on and seeing CNBC having the cameras in his face. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, we're going to do an interview for CNBC.  Oh.  Hold on one sec.  Oh, nice.  The iPhone 3GS.  We love iPhone and Apple products.  3GS.  We love it because it's got picture messaging soon.  And hopefully better reception, maybe.  3GS all the way.  Hopefully we'll spend $500 to $700 today. 
[01:19:30]  On this Apple product.  Is this your first one?  Uh, I'm going from the BlackBerry to the 3GS because I'm tired of all my hauls going through.  BlackBerry to Apple.  Well, I went on all these internet sites and they all told me that Apple has a touch screen.  And so on the iPhone, you can actually touch the screen to text.  And so that was the draw for me. 
[01:20:00]  I'm sick of BlackBerry.  BlackBerry is yesterday.  And iPhone is now.  3GS.  3GS.  3GS.  So obviously, obviously he was being so fucking sarcastic.  He's beating up the iPhone.  He's beating the fuck out of it.  I'm tired of getting all my calls.  All right.  Calls going through.  I mean, come on.  So this is how it was played out on CNBC.  For real.  Listen closely.  You know, I mean, they started off with the touch screen and everybody else followed thereafter.  It's a new generation, so that's great. 
[01:20:30]  BlackBerry is yesterday.  And iPhone is now.  That's all they play to me.  Those motherfuckers.  Soundbites, motherfucker.  That's all it is.  Soundbites, man.  Gotta be careful.  Now it looks like another just fanatic iPhone guy coming out.  At first, I thought it wasn't really a big deal because everybody pretty much heard it on this show.  But then I sent the CNBC clip to my dad as a joke, like, look at me on CNBC.  I'm famous.  And then he sent it back, like, you know, I can't believe you're just pandering for the iPhone. 
[01:21:00]  And I was like, I wasn't.  I was being sarcastic.  And he's like, no, I saw the clip.  So now everyone thinks you're a big.  You look like a little douche.  Everyone thinks you're an iPhone, you know, fanboy.  Yeah, now you're a fan.  Somebody called me this weekend that didn't hear the show, but they saw me on CNBC and they were like, yeah, so you have an iPhone.  Is it worth the upgrade?  Say.  And I was like, no, I'm talking to you on a BlackBerry right now.  I don't have an iPhone.  You don't even want an iPhone.  No, I had an iPhone and I switched to BlackBerry and I'm not switching back. 
[01:21:30]  I used to have an iPhone and I stopped using it to get a BlackBerry.  Let me see that dummy in action.  Let me see him moving.  iPhone is now.  Look, they cut out my 3G.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the innovation on it, you know, the touchscreen, you know, I mean, they started off with the touchscreen and everybody else followed their apps.  There's the media.  That's great.  BlackBerry is yesterday and iPhone is now.  You can see me cheating so bad. 
[01:22:00]  There's just nothing about this iPhone.  It doesn't.  The one feature, one, that makes me interested is that you can, and this ain't even shit, where you can pull out your voicemail.  That's the only interesting thing where you can look at it and go, oh, here's this voicemail here.  You don't have to run through all of them.  As opposed to running through them.  But ultimately, I don't give a shit.  Great feature.  Other than that.  There you go.  It's what you like.  You just don't know enough about it, Patrice. 
[01:22:30]  That's all I'm saying.  It does nothing.  You don't know enough about it.  It does everything.  Someone marched down that hallway and tell Steve Blatter that I gave away that iPhone.  It does everything.  And they're not getting it back.  You know what I want to do?  Maybe, Patrice, maybe I want to do my banking.  Okay.  There I am.  I'm banking right here on the run.  Maybe I want to trade some stock.  Do I want to trade stock?  Yes.  Now I'm e-trading.  There we go.  I'm going to trade some stocks.  Yeah.  There we go.  That's good for you.  I could do that.  I'm doing...  Maybe I want to know what... 
[01:23:00]  Maybe I just want to know what Article 4 of the United States Constitution is.  I got it.  Well, maybe...  I could do that, too, though.  Maybe in terms of a library.  In terms of BlackBerry, maybe you want to have technology that you haven't changed in about  10 years, and now you're going to have a phone, right?  All these things you're touching, next year is going to be, oh, shit, we forgot to put  all the good shit on this iPhone.  We're going to get up next year's iPhone and make the one that's $400 when it came out, 
[01:23:30]  $99.  Exactly.  So they do with everything, though.  That's what they do.  Of course you do.  They do that with all technology.  They don't do that with the BlackBerry, though.  Fuck yeah, they do, bro.  Look at the old BlackBerry.  They do it with every phone, every piece of technology we buy.  Punch up a picture of the first fucking BlackBerry.  Give me a break, that brick fucking piece of shit.  With the antenna.  With an antenna.  Not an antenna.  The fuck is that?  Hey, Ed, I don't want to drop this.  Sam, people are suggesting you sue CNBC for misrepresentation. 
[01:24:00]  I think I should.  I was about to ask, is there an app on the iPhone that helps you fight back against the  media?  Right.  I would definitely call him out on this.  Back against the media.  And Steven S. from Bayshore dropped the prime time.  It's now Apple shill Sam Roberts.  That's not what...  That quote was taken out of quote, out of context.  If any of our bloggers are listening right now and you want an exclusive interview with  Sam Roberts, please give the show a call immediately.  I know Crunch Gear is all over this.  Crunch Gear first broke the story.  What did Crunch Gear write? 
[01:24:30]  Crunch Gear reported...  It's a Brooklyn dude that loves our show.  Yes, because he reported that it was heard on the world famous special delivery with Sam  and Dave show.  Oh, really?  Fuck Crunch Gear.  It was discussed there.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, I mean, obviously Crunch Gear is very much into getting the inside scoop.  Mm-hmm.  But I think now is the time that we go all over the place with this.  You should call CNBC and say, look, what the fuck, man?  That's not what I said.  It's not what I...  I'm not happy about it.  It's not my intention. 
[01:25:00]  Hell no.  It's not the way I want it to be used on television.  They should have used your original clip because it was really funny.  That was funny.  Very sarcastic and shit.  But they don't like ratings.  They could have gone back and gone, well, obviously someone isn't as happy with the  iPhone as some of the other people.  Is that the original BlackBerry?  All right.  Look at this fucking thing.  Yeah.  Well, what the fuck?  Look.  That hasn't changed.  Look at it.  Monochrome screen.  Well, look, dude.  Give us a break.  We had to start somewhere.  But it's still the same basic technology.  Great.  So you're saying they've stood still. 
[01:25:30]  That's good.  No.  But yeah, it's because what they call this, what it does with emails.  Push?  Push email.  It's still.  I can push email.  You don't have push emails.  Not like BlackBerry.  No.  What do you mean push?  You have to do it through.  Meaning it grabs, it takes your email in real time, grabs it off the server.  You don't, it's not.  I don't, my shit comes, my email comes in as if I'm from a computer.  So it doesn't look like I'm texting you from Apple phone at Anthony.  It's fucking my email address.  This shit is, you gotta, it's not push. 
[01:26:00]  Look, look, here's my email.  Boom.  Here it is.  This is Patrice.  It's not taking off a server.  What?  It's not taking it off a server.  Yes, it is.  It's taking it off of Yahoo.  But you have to, you have to download that shit though.  Yeah, it's different.  It's different.  It's not like.  The only thing it really is.  Real time emailing.  iPhone pushes for the Mac mail.  So like, if I wanted to get my Gmail as quick on the iPhone as it did on my BlackBerry, I actually had to forward all my Gmail to my Mac mail address. 
[01:26:30]  Because it only pushes the Mac email.  I'm telling you.  New data will be pushed to your phone from the server.  Fetch new data.  Manually I have it set, but every 15 minutes, I could set it advanced.  Here's my, here's my.  It's a wonderful machine.  Push.  See?  I could fucking push my email.  It's a wonderful machine.  So don't misrepresent this. 
[01:27:00]  This is, this, the BlackBerry is, is practical business use, man.  It's not for games.  Oh, that's good.  It's not for games.  Well, this is practical business use and games.  No, no.  We're all business.  We're all business.  That's not a practical business use, man.  How is this not practical business use?  It's for fun.  No, it's not a toy.  Sounds like Patrice.  Business people don't have that.  Sounds like Patrice and Opie are CNBCing the BlackBerry iPhone.  Business people have two phones.  You got the BlackBerry when it's all business and then when they want to get fun and creative, 
[01:27:30]  they have the iPhone.  Let me tell you why business people don't have this and they have a BlackBerry.  Because the fucking corporate guys that give you the BlackBerry.  By the way, no one buys the fucking BlackBerry.  They work and then some fucking business guy goes, here's your official BlackBerry now that  you're part of the corporation.  Welcome to the club, son.  And they don't want you fucking around with all of the things you can do on the iPhone.  Because productivity will drop if you're, you know, on here on AIM or listening to SiriusXM  on the new app or Google. 
[01:28:00]  And don't forget BlackBerry has their touchtone version, which is the Storm.  It sucked a dick.  It failed.  Everyone hated it.  It's true.  What?  Yeah.  Storm failed.  That's what I'm saying.  Look at this.  I can go to Netflix.  I can fucking one push of a button and I can put down what I want Netflix to deliver to  me immediately right there.  Have you tried a BlackBerry?  Yeah, it sucks ass.  They tried to give me one.  BlackBerry's like, suck ass?  They tried to give me one.  You didn't really try it, though.  They tried to give me one.  I was using it for a day and I said, first of all, why do I want the corporate? 
[01:28:30]  What was your thing before that?  Trio.  I had a trio.  I had like five phones before this and one got TV and shit and I used to watch TV on  it and stuff on a little fucking one by one screen.  You're a diehard Apple guy.  I am now diehard.  There are problems.  I'm not going to say it's perfect.  He's all in.  But this fucking thing is, I cannot go a day without this thing.  Can't.  If I left this home, I'd be like-  And I don't like that it doesn't have a flash.  Every time I see somebody pull out a fucking Apple phone, it's no flash. 
[01:29:00]  The camera's no good.  They just got video.  I can't wait.  It's ridiculous.  You're taking pictures of fucking, what, models?  You need a flash with a shark.  You don't have a flash on your iPhone?  No.  Oh, I flash my ass off with my Blackberry.  That's right.  Blackberry's taking good pictures.  My pictures are fine.  No, that's why Patrice was a little dark in that picture.  It's for news.  What?  It's for news.  It's for grown-up things like the news.  Like if there's something going on, I turn my fucking video on, put the light, and Blackberry 
[01:29:30]  pictures come out perfect.  Oh, you see that flash, Ed?  What did it do?  Look at it.  It lit you up nice.  Look at that shit.  Look at that.  That's beautiful.  Did you see that funky shit he took of me?  That's right.  It looked like a prison picture.  I'm not even going to deal with you.  Oh, yeah?  Phone showdown.  Look at that.  There's no fucking difference in lighting.  Well, because I'm under a huge fucking spotlight.  Come on.  That's perfect. 
[01:30:00]  That is a delicious picture right there.  That does look good.  That does look good.  That does HD, I think.  He has an HD picture.  All right, listen.  How about your video, my friend?  My video is strong.  How about you?  How's your video?  I just love Blackberry.  All right?  Take a couple of seconds of video.  Of what?  Of me, and I'll take some of you.  No.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm ready.  What are you talking about?  What do you got to go through to take video?  Hold on a minute.  Come on.  I'm ready.  What are we going to do?  I'm taking video.  I'm taking video of Opie.  I'm taking video of Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  You get your funky fingerprints all over the thing all the time?  Patrice, say something for my video.  Make it good.  Here we go.  You're not even making my video good.  Motherfucker, you gave me two seconds to get my shit together.  I'm on your side.  Well, make something good.  I only have 30 seconds or I can't upload this.  30 seconds.  Say something funny.  I got 10 seconds.  I'm not WC Fields.  I'm just taking a video and send that shit.  All right.  Now.  All right.  Now.  Look at this video.  Look at this video. 
[01:31:00]  Now, now, now.  Now, see Opie's video.  Oh, shit.  Here's mine.  All right.  Here's mine.  Now, look.  I'll pan around.  Yeah, that's wonderful, Ant.  Here it is.  Here it is.  There's Patrice.  Shit.  Everything looks good.  Wow.  That's great.  I'm white.  Wow.  It looks like IMAX.  I might have to apologize.  That fucking video's pretty damn good.  Let's see Opie's video.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Why?  Why can't you just hit a button?  What do you got to do?  Oh, shit.  What do you got to do?  I might have to go fucking get out.  I might have to get an iPhone. 
[01:31:30]  My phone's put away already.  Come on.  Come on, nigga.  Come on, man.  He's selling his iPhone to me.  God damn.  He got to push.  What is he doing?  Because.  What is it?  What do you think?  You know why?  Developing the film?  It's meant.  It's meant.  It's functional video.  This is the brilliance of me.  Functional?  This is the brilliance of me.  While you're showing the boys your video, I just uploaded it to my Twitter.  Oh!  Opie Radio on Twitter.  See, I went for a cheap plug. 
[01:32:00]  I used you for a cheap plug.  Now I got to fucking upload mine.  It's called a nonsense video.  But there's nothing going on.  Because there's nothing going on.  I wrote a nonsense video of Patrice and Anthony.  Library Media.  All right.  Give it some time, though.  Yeah.  It's going to take probably 20 minutes to get up there.  There it is.  It does take a while.  Choose that.  Oh, does it?  Yeah, it does.  Let's take us along.  Anthony.  Twitter is up, but their servers are so overloaded.  Please try again.  That's because they're all looking at my shit.  Cheers to the king of Twitter right here. 
[01:32:30]  Opie Radio.  Thank you.  I think it's gone now.  It's uploading.  You're going to hear it.  I got Wi-Fi in this mofo.  Do you?  Nope.  I got some Wi-Fi shit happening.  It's a baby computer.  Don't say useless vid.  I said nonsense vid.  Well, mine's useless vid.  What the fucker?  And how the fuck do you type a full-fledged email on that damn screen?  Dude, you can't even tell how fast.  People go, I can't believe I texted you one sentence, and you texted me back three paragraphs 
[01:33:00]  in like no time.  I fly on this fucking thing.  You don't fly as big as this.  This is a fucking.  You got misspellings, though.  You still have misspellings on your emails.  No, I have a.  Well, that's not the phone's fault.  Do a little spell check, will you?  That's not the phone's fault.  It's mine.  Jesus.  My spelling skills leave a lot to be desired.  I'm telling you, man.  Ah, Perez Hill is crying.  Wow.  Wow.  A lot of exposure, but this is going to fuck him over in the end. 
[01:33:30]  Look at him.  Fucking guy can't take it.  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  You draw a jism coming out of people's mouths on your site, and you're surprised he got punched?  Right.  You fucking asshole.  He's a fan of drawing cocks all over the pictures that he puts up there, and little dribbles coming from people's noses, because allegedly they're into their drugs and their cocaine and shit.  And then someone finally calls you out and punches you in the face, and you can't take it.  Fuck off.  I gotta hear this guy, man.  I didn't hear him.  All right, we didn't do that.  We got it right here, right?  Yeah.  Sam, what do we got?  Well, here's what went down. 
[01:34:00]  Oh.  Perez Hilton was with Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  Yes.  At the Much Music Awards in Canada.  Dude, if I hear that fucking poker face-  By the way, my video's up, by the way.  Is yours up?  Oh, no.  I don't see Opie's.  Let me hit mine here to see if-  Anthony's competitive as a motherfucker.  He said, fuck Perez Hilton.  I'm going to show you this iPhone.  It's beautiful.  It's a brand new iPhone, too.  How about this?  And the old bold is comparable to this brand new fucking iPhone. 
[01:34:30]  Well, there it is.  Take a video.  Oh, boy.  I'm taking a video, Opie.  Yeah, well, my video is taking a little longer because it's a much better video.  Oh, let me turn it sideways so it's better.  Oh, wait.  See, I can see it like that and small.  What?  Once you turn it, oh, there it is.  Wait, you asked me if my video's up?  Yeah.  There's the replay, right?  Yeah, it's up there.  Oh, shit.  God damn it.  No.  This is by the live part, I mean.  No, see, we're in replay mode.  See?  No, we're not right now. 
[01:35:00]  No, see.  We are now.  Like, if you are listening.  And honestly, when we did this live this morning, yeah,  the video was up as well.  No.  Now you're just fibbing.  So?  I'm competitive too, motherfucker.  Where are we at?  Right.  So, Perez Hilton was there with Lady Gaga at the Much Music Awards.  You know what, motherfucker?  What?  What's going on?  I'm bailing on Zanel.  Fuck Zanel in the ass.  Yeah.  What side are you using?  It sounds like Zanel.  I'm using the frog one.  No, you're not.  Not for videos.  Why frog?  Yeah, it's for videos. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, my goodness.  What?  Yeah, it's for videos.  It's the same one?  I thought you were using that Twitterly twat.  I was until I realized I could do videos and they upload faster.  You lied.  You said you were doing something for videos earlier.  No, I was using Twitterlator to upload it to the froggy thing.  Why frog?  We got to upgrade, Sam.  You got to.  We got to look at it.  I will admit defeat on my video.  But not on the ride.  You know what?  By fucking noon today, I'll be upgraded to a much better fucking video server. 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  That's right.  I still ain't sold.  Oh, and E-Roch sent me a picture of Patrice smiling.  Oh, yeah?  Nah, that's impossible.  That's impossible.  Stop it.  Let me see.  Oh, how long is this going to take?  Oh, no.  How many buttons you got?  Anthony, can I see it on yours, please?  What the fuck?  You got a BlackBerry.  I might turn on BlackBerry.  I don't fucking know.  You know what I'll be using with that BlackBerry?  I'm kind of loose, by the way.  You know what I'll be using with that BlackBerry?  You're like a woman behind the counter when you're trying to get an airline ticket. 
[01:36:30]  And they're just going.  Type, type, type, type, type, type.  And you don't know what the fuck they're typing.  Half the shit they're typing is nonsense.  It takes forever, and then they just click that one key going click, click, click.  That's what you're doing.  I can't even get the Patrice picture because my fucking BlackBerry is slow because it's still  trying to upload my goddamn video.  But thank God your bosses could look at every email you send.  Oh, no shit.  That's always nice.  That's a nice feature.  It's their property.  Everything on it is their property. 
[01:37:00]  You know what?  My iPhone, go fuck yourself.  You'll never look at what's on here.  You know what?  It's how you look at it, my friend, because I write a little jabs in every one of my emails  just in case they're reading.  How many pictures you got on that thing right now?  What?  Photos.  I actually had a...  I didn't have to, but I...  Oh, you had a what?  No, no, no.  I had to clean it up.  I had like hundreds.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  For real.  No, you can...  Come to think of it, BlackBerry downloads fucking viruses, too.  For reals.  For reals, yo?  Oh, no.  Yeah, there's no viruses on this. 
[01:37:30]  They don't really...  See, the problem is everyone's hitting my Twitter right now, so it's making it really  hard for the video to be uploaded.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  Hey, where are we at there, Sam?  Let's move on to this other fucking thing.  Right.  It's at the Much Music Awards in Canada, and Perez doesn't like the Black Eyed Peas new  album.  Why?  No, why?  What did he say?  It only has like the top two songs in America right now.  So who did he draw with cum coming out of their ears and noses because he doesn't like  the album?  Right.  Well, he said Fergie was fugly.  Really?  Yeah.  See, if you're going to call someone fugly, you deserve to be punched in the face. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  And then, you know...  Consequences.  Fugly?  Really?  Really?  I'm sure drawing a little bit of jizz on Will.i.am and stuff like that.  See?  He doesn't like this new album.  He's said nice things about those people before, but he doesn't like this album, and  he bashed it.  Why is he bashing an album that is like, as far as the pop world goes, is...  Because Perez-el doesn't like it.  Ugh.  Perez.  So then the Black Eyed Peas came up to him at this award show, and they were like, why  are you...  Stop doing this.  Why are you, you know, insulting our album? 
[01:38:30]  And he was like, kind of like, I can do whatever I want.  So finally, this is Perez.  Because he did a video blog where he explains that there was a confrontation after the Much  Music Awards at one of the after parties between Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas, the lead  singer, or rapper, and Perez-el.  This is it?  Really?  Yes.  I am making this video as Mario La Vendita.  That is my legal name.  What happened...  Oh, shut the fuck up.  What did you say his name was? 
[01:39:00]  Mario La Vendita, or something like that?  Okay.  What a dramatic asshole.  My legal name.  What happened to me in Toronto happened to me as a human being, and it should not happen  to anyone.  Oh, but all the things you do to these celebrities in there, and the celebrities' kids, by the  way, that aren't even in the fucking business, right?  Yeah, the whole thing with Adam Sandler's kid.  But they deserve all that shit.  What did he do to Adam Sandler?  Adam Sandler's kid.  He used to talk about how ugly Adam Sandler's kid was all the time. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, really?  Did Adam Sandler's kid deserve that, considering Adam Sandler's kid's not in the business, even?  Not at all.  Perez-fucking-Hilton?  Happened to anyone.  Violence is never the answer.  Ah, it sure is when it's against you, you dummy.  Ah, punch in the face.  Good for you.  If you're gonna play that game, you gotta expect maybe some violence, you idiot.  My legal name is Mario Armando La Vendita.  And I have something to say.  I got fun. 
[01:40:00]  Jesus.  Violence is never the answer.  Jesus.  You know what?  This is it for him.  He's not gonna be able to live past this.  It's embarrassing.  But then he goes back to drawing his cum bubbles.  Yes, cum bubbles.  And people are gonna be like, oh, okay.  And fucking big dicks in people's mouths and things like that.  People are just gonna start punching him in the face everywhere.  Get out of here.  Oh, man.  This is it for him.  You can't just punch him in the face to get publicity.  You can't punch him in the face.  Yeah, in the end.  Once again, my name is Mario.  I was hit again.  Armando La Vendita.  I was punched the third time in a week. 
[01:40:30]  I think in the end, this destroys what he built up.  Why, you think?  Because now he can't go back to drawing cum bubbles and fucking big, huge fucking cops on  the foreheads of Lindsay Lohan and whatnot.  Because he lost all his credibility.  Right.  This loses his credibility.  He loses his cum bubble drawing credibility.  Yes.  Because that's all he was good for.  He's not saying anything interesting with his blogs.  He was fucking...  Now he can't take it.  He was taking other people's pictures and drawing cum bubbles and shit. 
[01:41:00]  This is great.  So how does he go back to doing that?  For real?  I've never ever seen this fucking website.  It's like a TMZ.  Yeah, I've heard of him.  Wear a condom.  Look, show some of, you know, the brilliance of Perez Hilton.  It's horrendous.  He's a douchebag.  Ever.  Blood should never be drawn.  Another person should never be hit.  That's why people die.  What is he babbling about? 
[01:41:30]  He was attacked.  Oh, attacked.  He's got to go hard at black-eyed peas on his website.  Otherwise, he loses credibility.  Oh, I don't think he will.  Like, if he doesn't, then all celebrities know, oh, I'll just go up and punch this guy in his head.  And he'll stop fucking drawing cocks in my ass.  Perez explains his interaction with Will.i.am.  Who's Will.i.am?  I really don't know.  Black-eyed peas.  Yeah, he's the head guy of the black-eyed peas.  Oh, he's the head guy.  And he does production for tons of people. 
[01:42:00]  He's a big star.  So he's one of the main guys.  Because I heard he was the manager or something.  And he was in X-Men origin, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he played the cowboy hat.  Yeah, he played the cowboy hat.  Nice.  Okay.  And as we were actually getting ready to leave, Will.i.am, from the black-eyed peas, comes  into the club, sees me like a heat-seeking missile, and comes directly towards me.  Into my mouth.  Gay-seeking missile.  And he says, yo, I need you to do me a favor.  I need you to never write about my band on your website again. 
[01:42:30]  Right in my face he was saying this.  Yeah.  And I was like, listen, I can't make any promises, but I'll try.  Then he says, why are you disrespecting me?  Why are you disrespecting me?  And I was like, I'm not disrespecting you.  And I did the whole spiel again that I gave Fergie.  But it was honest.  I told him, listen, you know, I love what you did with the Pussycat Dolls.  I love the work that you also did with Fergie's solo album.  He's like, you need to respect me.  And at that point, in my mind, I was like, you know what, I am not going to let this man 
[01:43:00]  intimidate me.  And I told him, you know what, no, I don't need to respect you.  I don't respect you.  And that's when I made the split-second decision that I was going to say what I thought was  the worst possible thing that thug would ever want to hear.  He did not.  I told him, and you know what, I don't need to respect you, and you're a fag.  You're gay and stuff is such a faggot.  And then I knew it was he said, come on.  But I didn't want to get into a fight with this person. 
[01:43:30]  So I left.  We leave.  Isn't it safe to say there's one other word that's worse in that scenario?  Just a little worse.  Wow, you're real brave, Perez.  You couldn't even go all in.  Taking the slur that would offend Perez Hilton.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he would offend himself.  Is he officially gay?  Officially, yeah.  Officially.  Super gay.  Officially.  Officially.  Super gay, yeah.  Because he's the gayest.  When you say your S's past seven minutes, you're fucking gay. 
[01:44:00]  What the fuck?  Oh, so he got all brave and called him a fag.  Yeah.  Wow, Perez.  This is Miss California.  Wow, because the guy had a problem with what you were saying about him.  Perez is the one who destroyed.  Do you understand?  If you call someone a fag, guess what?  You might just get punched in the face for that.  Perez is the one who destroyed Miss California for not supporting gay marriage.  Right, right, right.  There you go.  This is the same guy.  Yeah.  What a douche.  Jesus.  Always hated this fucking guy.  I want this.  My name is, what's my name? 
[01:44:30]  I'm Mario Armando Lavangera.  What's my name?  And I need the FBI to investigate this hate crime.  Op.  He looks like Ant.  Yeah, he does.  Without his makeup?  Look at him.  Root.  Perez says Will's manager punched him.  Yeah.  So Will didn't even punch.  No, but he said, you know, he implied that Will had something to do with it.  We leave the club, and as soon as we leave, there's Will.I.Am again outside of the club. 
[01:45:00]  Then his manager, Polo.  For the Ron and Fez fans, okay.  Yeah.  Let's acknowledge it.  Sounds just like Fez.  Everyone's writing.  And Ronnie outside.  Hey.  And I did not once ever.  Cut me one ounce of slack.  My name is Fez Watley.  And I never got cut one ounce of slack. 
[01:45:30]  I don't even know if I can play the clip now.  We leave the club, and as soon as we leave, there's Will.I.Am again outside of the club.  Then his manager, Polo, whom I have met before, from behind comes up to me, clocks me in the eye right here, and punches me two or three times.  I am in shock.  I just do not know what to do. 
[01:46:00]  I touch my eye, and it was bleeding.  I see my fingertips, and I'm bleeding.  I think my eye might be falling out of my head.  Shut up.  I'm in shock.  Then you can get scope fucked.  Everyone's trying to avoid a scene.  So after this happened, we leave, and we go back to the hotel.  And Will.I.Am followed us to the hotel.  Can I say something real quick?  It's just, if the word faggot didn't exist, you would say it naturally. 
[01:46:30]  You would invent it listening to this motherfucker.  You would just go, shut the fuck up, faggot.  It's grading, man.  It's fucking grading.  Shut the fuck up, bitch.  What's wrong with this motherfucker, man?  John from North Carolina.  We're making the same point.  He's on the phone.  He writes, isn't his blogging considered provoking?  Yes, that's what we're getting at.  Of course.  He provokes these guys like crazy.  By the way, Perez Hilton was the one news source that talked about the Donald Trump buying 
[01:47:00]  Raw incident as if it was real.  Oh, really?  Yes.  He said it was a goodbye for Donald Trump.  Real.  So that's where Perez Hilton's coming from.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we go back to the hotel.  And Will.i.am followed us to the hotel, which is where they were also staying.  At this point, I'm freaking out.  Why do they just follow us outside of the club?  I'm attacked.  I'm bleeding.  And they're following us back to the hotel. 
[01:47:30]  I called the police.  Even though Gaga had a bodyguard, what if one of these people had a gun?  Oh, stop it.  So this whole thing broke.  It's not like they carry gun.  Oh.  This whole thing broke because on Perez Hilton's Twitter, before any of this was posted, it  just said things like, please help me.  Call the police for me.  I'm at the hotel.  What?  Why?  It took less time to push 911.  He's tweeting for the police. 
[01:48:00]  He's trying to explain that because Will.i.am tweet the police instead of, or tweet that  he needs the police instead of just calling.  Instead of calling 911.  Because he's fucking looking for publicity.  But Will.i.am put up a video right away and said, you know, first of all, he was tweeting.  He was like, second of all, it wasn't, it was just some random fan that punched him.  Like, Will.i.am said all this and some random guy punched Perez.  And Perez said, no, it was Will.i.am's manager.  But how does he know?  That's the dispute.  He said it was definitely Polo. 
[01:48:30]  Hold on, we got some, we got Kevin in Florida.  Kevin.  I'm just waiting for the part of the video where he says that he sold crack cocaine in  a limousine to Senator Obama.  He does sound like that guy.  Crack cocaine for his use, powdered cocaine for mine.  For mine.  I gotta remember that exact quote.  I then had oral sex with Mr. Obama.  Jesus Christ.  I thought I was in Gurney. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  In Gurney.  Right here in Gurney.  We were in a hotel in Gurney.  Gurney.  Where are you?  Perez explains what happened when he called police, then starts crying.  Oh, no way.  Oh, he starts crying big time.  Oh, this rules.  What a fruit.  I called 911.  I spoke to the police, and they explained to me that, you know, they would try to make  it, but that there were actual emergencies going on. 
[01:49:30]  That's what happened when I called 911 because I had a flat tire.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  It's not real.  Fix it yourself.  But I'm in the woods, and there's a guy with a mask, a hockey mask on.  Don't bug us, bitch.  Hey, what's the mainstream media on?  Whose side is, like, you know, the mainstream media on?  Oh, they'll eat this shit up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, but are they saying Will.i.am is a dirty bastard, or are they on Perez Hilton?  I don't know.  What are they saying?  Will.i.am hasn't been vilified yet because nobody can concretely say who punched him. 
[01:50:00]  I think he just, this friggin' Perez Hilton looks like an idiot in this whole thing.  Can I tell you, like, Black Eyed Peas or Black Eyed Peas?  Black Eyed Peas.  They're smart enough to know they got a beef with Perez Hilton, right?  You know damn well that, you know, Will.i.am can't punch nobody.  Of course not.  So they have the confrontation that Will.i.am goes, you know what?  And one of his entourage-type guys, one of his guys that hangs around and goes, all right, 
[01:50:30]  and then punches him in the face.  Punches him in the face.  They'll never know who punched Perez Hilton in the face.  And it's perfect because Perez knows exactly who punched him in the face.  One of his guys.  There you go.  You know what?  They should have people.  Those guys know how to take care of their shit.  They probably have people that are punch-in-the-face people.  Absolutely.  It's like, you're a punch-in-the-face guy.  If I'm talking to somebody, you come up and just punch him in the face.  I don't know you. 
[01:51:00]  You get money under the table.  You never talk to us.  Will.i.am had a one-minute conversation with someone, and he didn't even say punch-in-the-face.  Yeah.  But this guy knew, I gotta go punch him in the face now.  I gotta go punch him in the face now.  A little peripheral vision look.  Right.  A little look, a little, you know, this is what happened, and the guy just gave him a nod.  And that was it.  Whoop that sissy's ass.  Punch him in the face.  Emergencies going on.  But I was in fear for my safety.  And I had been assaulted.  So when the police are taking their time, and they're not coming, I'm freaking out. 
[01:51:30]  I took to Twitter.  Because I was in shock.  Yeah.  I took to Twitter.  Because that's the first place you go.  Yeah.  I took to Twitter after that.  It's not like you're in the middle of a cornfield in the middle of nowhere, and you're like,  oh, fuck, there's no phones around, but I got my Twitter on me.  You know what I mean?  There gotta be somehow.  You're in a hotel, and you can call on a phone, or the phone you got in your hand.  What does he have?  Like, he probably has, what, two million fucking followers or something, right?  I don't know.  But I want to know if anybody called the fucking cops.  Well, he thanks the people who did indeed call. 
[01:52:00]  I'm sure they did.  Because you know they're idiots who, like, probably woke up the next morning 12 hours after it happened,  and, Perez is in trouble.  Oh, my God.  Help him.  Help him.  Oh, my God.  Someone's speaking of Perez and Lady Gaga.  Who the fuck is Lady Gaga?  Lady Gaga.  She's the it girl right now.  Why do you think it rained so hard last night?  That was all of Perez Hilton's fans crying alongside him.  I felt helpless.  That's right. 
[01:52:30]  And that was my very public cry for help.  Oh, shit.  And to all of those people who expressed concern and who called the police.  Let's invent a new word for faggot.  Thank you.  Let's invent a new word.  From the bottom of my heart.  Thank you.  Because I am a human being.  This ruins him.  He's a twaggot.  Twaggot.  See, this guy.  He's a twag. 
[01:53:00]  This ruins him.  This ruins what he was building up.  Shut the fuck up, twag.  Because then he realizes, wow, everyone realizes out there, wow, this guy isn't as brave as we thought.  Like, you know.  The whole point of, like, if you make fun of everybody, you have to be somebody that people can't make fun of.  Right.  But now he's, like, obviously vulnerable.  He's so vulnerable.  He's a twag.  This ruins him.  I'm telling you.  Six months from now, his sight is nothing.  He'll get some nice exposure and buzz the next week or two. 
[01:53:30]  After that, people are going to be like, eh.  This is, was this Twitter right there?  Yeah.  I was assaulted by Will.  I was assaulted by.  No, no, no, no.  He shouldn't put that up there.  Because I got the whole line of Twitter.  Oh, you do?  We're going to go to it in a second.  Oh.  That's like the third one in.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, because I'll give you the whole development of this thing.  Right after this clip.  It's almost over.  And no one deserves to be treated that way.  You do.  Bye.  Difference is never the answer.  Yeah, but drawing the cocks and, you know, what do you, what do you, sometimes people 
[01:54:00]  get punched in the face.  I just want to make sure we get our point out there.  That's all.  What do you think is going to happen?  Everything, you know, your freedom to post that has consequences.  It gets, our freedom to speak on the air has consequences.  If you go out on the street and say the wrong thing to somebody, you have the freedom to  say it, but, you know, consequences.  There's a reason why Club Soda Kenny escorts you out of the building.  Exactly.  Just in case.  Somebody punches you in the face. 
[01:54:30]  You never know.  Punch in the face, guy.  We've had some incidents, but we're not sitting there crying.  Someone came up to me.  My real name is Anthony Armando Cumia.  And I want to tell you, someone came up to me and said, ma, ma, boo me in my face.  I don't need that.  I'm a human being.  Shut up, you fruit.  Oh, God. 
[01:55:00]  I think even the gay guys that listen to us would admit that this guy's a fruit.  I know.  Jesus.  They'd start eating pussy after listening to this guy.  Fuck this.  I would never make something like this up or try to use something like this for a press.  No.  Because I don't need it.  And I don't need anything that happened.  And fuck you where I am for lying.  Shame on you.  God is looking down on you and shaming you. 
[01:55:30]  Fuck you.  You fucking coward.  Fuck you both.  You know me.  Well, if you want to bring God into it.  I want all respect for all of you and the black eyed peas.  Look at that face.  And Fergie, you're a fuckly bitch.  Oh, that's real brave.  Real brave now.  What a fucking loser.  Because he said in your jizz stained bed that you're fucking recording this from.  From the safety of his house.  Wow, that's real brave.  Because the whole thing started.  Fergie went up to him and goes, why are you insulting me on the website? 
[01:56:00]  Like, I thought we were actually kind of friends.  Like, I thought we were cool.  And he was like, oh, no, no, no.  I loved your solo stuff.  That's just being silly.  That's just for the web, whatever.  Right.  And so now that Fergie is not there, he's in his hotel room crying.  You could have said it right to her face.  Yeah.  That is the best freeze frame ever.  We had one of those guys that used to work for us that saw me right on the street.  Could have said whatever the fuck you wanted.  And then he went and did a cute little article.  Wow, that was real fucking brave.  You just, you listen to this guy, right?  And at the end of the day, you know, you wonder if he has a, you know, friend. 
[01:56:30]  You can picture someone sitting there listening to this whole thing.  Yeah.  And at the end of it, just looking at him and going, so.  So?  Just so what?  Like, there's nothing about this that just evokes anything.  There's no sympathy.  None at all.  You can't even imagine anybody gives a fucking shit.  Like, sometimes I watch TMZ and you just get the guy, the lawyer dude, and you just go,  he needs one too.  Just a sock in his fucking jaw.  Just because, you know, they feel protected by something. 
[01:57:00]  But there's a lot of people in this business that came from places where you punch.  You punch someone on their shit.  You don't have mental warfare.  I don't got time to be drawing shit bubbles on you.  It's like, dude.  I'm just going to punch you.  I'm just going to fucking hit you.  Like, there's people who just, they come from, you don't come from mental warfare with sissies  pointing at you and, sorry, and sissies pointing at you and doing things and in your face. 
[01:57:30]  And then, I don't know if you've ever watched TMZ, but it's just, the guy's just sitting  there just.  All smarmy.  Look at him.  Look at him.  And they got pictures of people with crust in their ears and shit.  And you just go, what the fuck?  What do you got?  Well, I got a picture.  As he drinks his drink out of his sippy straw or whatever.  Like, are you serious?  Just like, sippy cup.  Dude.  Or a sippy cup.  I got to say this.  Andy from Atlanta.  Check out John Mayer's Twitter in response to Perez.  Classic line.  John Mayer wrote, I also want to train you in an old martial art called, never call a 
[01:58:00]  black dude a faggot jitsu.  What do you expect to happen if you call a black guy a faggot?  He'll probably punch you in the face three times.  You're a faggot.  And you should understand that consequence.  And then, if you do get punched in the face, you don't run to your hotel and cry like  a bitch.  And he might as well call him a nigger because it was the same outcome to just get some satisfaction.  He might as well said the real one.  At least he would have been dropping, you know, the big one. 
[01:58:30]  Hey, what the fuck is wrong with him?  I like how he brings up God, too, saying, you know, God looking down on you, shame on you.  Technically, if you go by, you know, the Catholic Church, I think God's looking down on some  of your activities and going, ah, that was God's curse for you.  God's was working through Will.i.am's manager.  Yeah, you're trying to figure out who punched you.  You might want to look at God.  I think someone was doing God's dirty work.  There are some people that have interpreted the Bible as being very anti-gay. 
[01:59:00]  So if you want to invoke the name of God looking down on somebody.  And how great is it that he got a black guy from one of the black IPs?  Why did anybody say that the whole time?  I mean, it was the obvious, but it just has to be verbalized.  All right, here's Perez's Twitter.  So it started with this at 3.34 in the morning.  I'm in shock.  I need the police ASAP.  Please come to the Soho Metropolitan Hotel now, please. 
[01:59:30]  And then, and then.  Ed McMahon's dead.  Oh, sorry.  What?  Yeah, Ed McMahon died.  What?  Ed McMahon's dead.  Motherfucker.  Oh.  What are you doing on the news?  Are you twittering it?  This is how you get followers, man.  You better get breaking news.  I'm panicking.  Freaky.  Freaky.  Flip on the TV audio, maybe, or something.  Wow.  How do you spell Ed?  Oh. 
[02:00:00]  Really?  He died?  Of what?  Ed now.  Of 86-ness.  He's Mike Hoffman.  Was he broke?  I don't know.  Died broke?  Yeah, he did.  Something happened, and he lost all his money.  He lost his house.  I lost that video war.  Oh, wait.  Oh, little Nicky.  Ed McMahon is dead.  That's little Nicky.  Hi, little Nicky.  Hi, little Nicky.  I lost the video war, but I'm not going to lose the breaking news for you.  I should have.  As far as Twitter goes.  So you could have fucking did that.  I didn't know that you'd do that. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Look at Dick Clark and Ed McMahon together in younger days.  Oh, boy.  Now they're both messes.  Well.  Well.  One's more of a mess than the other.  The other one's in a funeral home right now.  That sucks.  All right.  So.  He wasn't looking too good.  At 336, I was assaulted by Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas and his security guards.  I'm bleeding.  Please.  I need to file a police report.  No joke.  So two minutes later, he got no response. 
[02:01:00]  So he tweeted again.  Instead of going with the fucking phone.  Two minutes later?  Right.  Meanwhile, Ed McMahon needed help and he couldn't get any because.  Right.  You're all being sent over to this idiot's house.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, TMZ is reporting that Glad wants Perez to apologize for using the word faggot.  He just fucked up his whole world.  Trust me.  Watch how this one plays out.  344, Ant.  That's now 10 minutes later from the first one.  Still waiting for the police.  The bleeding has stopped. 
[02:01:30]  I need to document this.  Please.  Can the police come to the Soho Met Hotel?  This is from the voice cock mouth reporter.  Recorder?  Reporter.  I think.  Such a good one, too.  That was good.  3.59 a.m.  I spoke to my lawyer.  I really need to talk to the authorities.  Please come to the Soho Met Hotel.  Have called the police.  Need them here.  So the police still not there.  25 minutes later.  Yeah, because they're busy.  Right.  And he said.  At this point, he called the police. 
[02:02:00]  So his Twitter didn't help him.  The Toronto police are here now.  Thank you.  Please stop calling them.  4.16 a.m.  Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your concern.  The police are investigating the assault now.  I did the right thing by reporting it.  5.26.  And then finally, won't be talking about this any further.  It's in the hands of the authorities.  Bata.  And then after that, he did the video blog.  Right.  So he said.  I'm not talking about it anymore.  And then he did 11 minutes of vlogging on it.  I heard that the entire 11 minutes is worth playing. 
[02:02:30]  Is that true?  So if you want me to pull the whole 11.  I mean, those are the best clips.  But I'll pull the whole 11 minutes.  What else does he do in there?  He just whines and cries a lot.  It's great.  I could listen to him whine and cry all day.  Here's what he thought, by the way.  Here's what he thought.  You know how Twitter is taking off as far as breaking news.  Tweety, tweety, tweety, tweet.  Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.  Exactly.  As far as, like, Iran goes.  A lot of that.  A lot of stuff coming in from Iran over the Twitter.  It's fucking up newspapers and everything.  When a plane goes down, people are, like, leaving the crash site going, oh, my God, I was just in a plane crash. 
[02:03:00]  Some guy Twittered that.  He actually thought this was going to be.  And, wow, Twitter being used to get the police to it.  And no one gave a shit.  No one gave a shit that this idiot, this hypocritical dolt, got his fucking comeuppance by getting punched by somebody.  Not because he's gay, but because he's an asshole.  Because he's a dickhead. 
[02:03:30]  He's a fucking asshole who badmouths people on his stupid website.  And finally, someone called him out and punched him in the face.  Definitely, yeah, take the gay angle out of it.  He's just a douche.  He's all brave on his website.  Yeah.  There's a consequence, like we've explained over and over again here.  That's right.  Hey, getting back to the Ed McMahon thing.  He's dead.  What's going to be the cartoon tomorrow?  Or what's going to be the fucking.  Oh, the headline on the.  Or the editorial where Johnny and Eddie.  Eddie.  And Ed are finally together.  They're finally back together in heaven. 
[02:04:00]  You think there's going to be, like.  God's laughing.  You think there's going to be a cartoon of, like, Johnny Carson, like, at his desk.  Goodness gracious.  Ed McMahon is in his box.  Ed McMahon on the couch.  And then it's floating on a cloud.  I see it.  Dino and Sammy.  They're going to have halos.  Yeah.  They're finally together again.  Yeah.  What douchey thing they're going to do.  Unless you can fucking bury them in the box together.  Guess what?  They're never going to be together again.  Maybe St. Peter at the gate going, here's Ed. 
[02:04:30]  And that sounds like about right.  That sounds like about the one they'll use.  I was thinking.  I was thinking Johnny would be, like, in heaven going, here's Ed.  Here's Ed.  Homework assignment.  Because we got a lot of cartoonists out there.  Take a look at your local papers tomorrow.  And please send in these.  Give us the ones.  Give us the cartoons.  Because you know they're hard at work right now.  Yeah.  Trying to come up with that clever one.  Ugh.  Fuck.  One more clip of Perez Hilton.  Do you think, like, remember how Ed McMahon used to come up with a big check for their 
[02:05:00]  publisher's clearinghouse?  Do you think there was a knock on the door and Ed opened it and it was the Grim Reaper?  Hey, you're a winner.  See?  You may have already been dead.  Why not have a little fun with your cartoon?  Yeah, come on.  Why does it have to be with the halos and some clout thing?  Well, what?  He rocks.  I guess God needed a sidekick.  We were all trying to figure out what the Ed McMahon thing would be.  Because we do that with every person that dies.  It's going to be, here's, you know, something. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  Here's Ed.  Yeah, it was a little obvious, yeah.  That's why we didn't.  None of us said it.  I was going to point that out.  We were really trying to come up with something that might be a little more clever than that,  E-Rock.  Jesus.  He couldn't wait to get it in.  Everyone kind of thought of that already.  Nobody said it.  No, we're thinking of that one where people go, wow, that's clever.  You better watch out when God needs another fatso.  Jesus Christ.  One more clip of Perez before we wrap this up.  And somehow, through some irony of God, through some joke that he finds funny, that the Supreme 
[02:06:00]  Green Pines is funny, my birthday ends up at the end of this month that I have had the  most brutal time of.  I'm supposed to sit here and take, you know, and drink and have a great time.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, act like nothing's happened whatsoever. 
[02:06:30]  I know, buddy.  Here's what I mean.  I have been brutalized through this month, and you never, ever got me one ounce of slack.  Not once did you ever say, hey, I'm here for you.  It was always, hey, I'm here for me.  Wow.  Yeah.  He doesn't like the black eyed piece.  No, that's horrible.  Fergie was never there for him.  No, yeah.  Him and Fergie were supposed to be friends.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's too bad.  Oof. 
[02:07:00]  Wow, that's rough.  Matthew from Brooklyn.  We're getting more info.  Ed McMahon died of pneumonia, or how do we say it on our show?  Pneumonia.  Pneumonia.  I hate that P.  And a back injury.  What?  What are you doing?  I died from a back injury.  You can die from a back injury.  Ow, this hurts.  Ow.  You just ow yourself to death?  Yeah.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow. 
[02:07:30]  He's giving the godfather cough in the tomato field.  He's dying of constantly saying ow.  Oh, that's so fucking terrible.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, my God.  Poor bastard.  Oh.  Battle with pneumonia and a neck injury.  Someone's got local knowledge out there.  It's Spank Bank from Buffalo.  He goes, in a city full of fags, how did the Toronto police know where to go? 
[02:08:00]  I guess that's some local knowledge.  Oh, I don't know.  Toronto, I don't know.  All right.  Poor Perez-o.  Yeah.  He calls himself Perez-o.  That's one of the nicknames.  The Gossip Gangster.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  The Gossip Gangster?  Yeah.  That's one of his real names?  Yeah.  The whole new thing now.  Did he come up with the Gossip Gangster?  Of course.  You know what?  Wouldn't that be great?  Do you understand the gangster life, what could happen to you?  So if you're going to say you're the Gossip Gangster, this is exactly what you should have  expected.  He thinks he's cute. 
[02:08:30]  He focused more on the gossip.  He thinks he's cute.  Than the gangster.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, guess what?  Really cute.  This ruins him in the end, I'm telling you.  This should just be a new thing celebrities do, is just punch him in the face as like  a goof.  Oh, and that will ruin him.  It's just like, once that floodgate opens, you tap him on his jaw, and then they look around  and go, wait, no one's coming after me.  Yeah.  No one cares.  No one cares.  He's twittering.  No one cares.  Celebrities need to come together and start a blog that's just pictures of different celebrities 
[02:09:00]  punching Perez Hill in the face.  And I got punched again.  I'm Mario Armando Lavandera, and I've been hit again.  Twitter the police or something.  Oh, Jesus.  The Twitter police show up.  How is the media really handling this?  They're just kind of using the sensationalism of it right now. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Like, I mean, obviously Perez Hilton is way over the top.  Is there one guy that's brave enough to go, well, what did he expect?  Back to you, Connie.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Should have expected a fist in his face.  Oh, what?  This is on?  I believe he was dissing.  If I may use the word diss, dissing a member of the Black Eyed Peas.  Well, what did the faggot expect?  Oh, Jesus.  Is this on?  Now sports with Tank.  Tank.  But they're really going to use, the regular news is going to really use the Black Eyed Peas angle. 
[02:10:00]  The Black Eyed Peas.  Yeah, Black Eyed Peas.  Yeah.  It seems that Black Eyed has happened to Perez.  Well, they've lived up to their name, the Black Eyed Peas, by giving a black eye to Armando fucking shithead Lorenzo Lama.  They're now the Black Eyed Peas, because the.  Black Eyed Peas are like the safest musical group that any black guy could ever be a part of. 
[02:10:30]  Wait for the real gangsters go, oh, shit.  You mean I could punch that motherfucker in the face?  He's going to get raped after this one.  They're going to bite that shit.  Yeah, Sam's right.  Oh, man.  For a shizzle.  Some hardcore fucking.  They're safe gangsters.  They're family-friendly Walmart, like, hip-hop music.

[02:19:30]  night i think 85 times since it's come on uh hbo uh just to make sure i didn't like it  and uh i i love it except for you know christian bells when he when he's batman not when he's bruce  wayne but when he's batman yeah and but what a uh i the movie has become more amazing to me as  i'm watching it it's real intricate shit yeah and i thought it was just like wow this is a  fucking deep movie the idea and it's it's a shame i'm i'm even more sad that he's just dead because 
[02:20:00]  the joker has to be in the movie forever from now on it's great because of the way he that ending  thing where he's just giving that speech about i need you you need me and just it was tremendous  yeah now how do they do that what do they recast it dude i hope they they're gonna recast it i hope  they try and i and and it's gonna they probably trying to cast it now oh yeah like just they're  gonna spend the next two years trying to find a joker that works because he was he was fucking 
[02:20:30]  amazing man i mean i you know you watch a movie the first time and you go oh this is cool and then  you watch it for the the small little so that you can answer trivia questions and shit about it  you know enough to get trivia questions the only problem i had with the movie the only problem  was i just didn't believe um uh uh maggie gillan i just didn't believe that the those two powerful  good-looking men want both powerful in front of the scenes and behind the scenes one was the 
[02:21:00]  fucking the the cape crusader the dark knight and he was a billionaire fucking boy yeah and then the  other guy was a powerful d.a who was a crusader and it just i kept watching trying to turn not only  she wasn't pretty enough to be a distraction to batman because it almost reminded me of margot  kidder and superman 2 where you go did you give up like here's the problem bruce wayne is thinking 
[02:21:30]  about giving up everything for for for this and and and and then at the end of the day she wasn't  a magnificent actress in it no she was that's what bothered me too she didn't belong in that movie  it just wasn't the best part of the movie yeah they were fighting over margot kidder yeah it wasn't  it wasn't cool like superman it's like you're gonna give up my powers for you what here's a real  woman a real woman is like hey listen i'm gonna give up my powers my only way i can be with you  fully is to give up my pop a real woman guy you are you a fuck yeah stupid just lick my i'd rather 
[02:22:00]  just be superman's bitch yeah you don't have to you know blow my head off with some fucking but  when you come you give up your powers for like a megan fox not a margot which one's megan fox  transformers transformers and she's not cast right in there either but you give it up she's way too hot  she's too hot right you give up everything for megan fox not a margot she would be believable in batman  and and and what you call should be in transformers that they should switch there 
[02:22:30]  you go the switch thing they should switch but anyway i just want to say that you know watching  these these movies it's just that pitch man i i don't i have to say any of these movies that is  one which one you're a big movie guy yeah you see i haven't seen the hangover yet i liked it  i i really did the trailers is amazing but i'm not getting great reports from the streets  well the trailer makes it look like it's just a normal like fucking buddy not to me the trailers  man when he kicks the phone out that kid's hand and that kid's look yeah i i wanted to see it just 
[02:23:00]  from that but i haven't seen it yet what do you mean the word on the street this meaning people who  saw it this is one of those word of mouth movies that's that's keeping the numbers up people are  seeing and then turning other it's a big movie big rated r movie who are you talking to saying they  don't like it a few people that just went like this comedy guys regular guys comedy guys they're  tough you comedy guys are tough but see the thing about comedy dudes they won't lie they give credit  where credit is due even though it'll be basic you know hollywood formula as far as the comedy goes 
[02:23:30]  it's it's good it's well written too man by the way the writing in this a little rated r trivia by the  the way oh highest grossing rated r movie of all time hangover no i'm asking wait say it again  highest grossing rated r movie of all time i'm gonna go wow don't put shit up steve you an  asshole how how uh give us like how many years or be vague recent or very very sort of recent

[02:25:00]  never reached number one at the box office that's not fair that movie had god on its side well 370  million dollars but it really isn't it just had jesus getting punched in the stomach for an hour  and some change jesus being true i'm jesus christ and i'm twittering they're putting me on a cross  i'm jesus mario armando lavedere christ

[02:28:00]  that but it's that goddamn um when he married the wrong bitch the the heartbreak kid when he he  married a bitch like spur of the moment and he realized she was an asshole she was a coke head  she was a fucking dude yeah it was made me laugh but tropic thunder is the last movie  dude what was the one that killed you the robert let me tell you what sold me on this movie and it 
[02:28:30]  was the part i never enjoyed a movie more than seeing tropic thunder with patrice well there was  what six of us in the theater they they gave us a theater and it was just a it was me you bob  kelly's stunt brain and i think that was it i think it was like four of us five it was and uh  it was one of stunt brain's friends i think it was like five or six of us and i think danny was there  too danny was there i think yeah we had a whole theater to ourselves and patrice made me laugh  harder than i think the film was he went went to make you laugh look when ben stiller goes are you 
[02:29:00]  people and fucking robert downey goes what you mean you people like i said this movie and then  here's what else would make a great stuff because he's represented the black man how  fucking racist the movie was it was so fucking uh uh tom cruise was genius with the hairy jew  knuckles these giant hairy jew knuckles and he was just a piece of garbage i go how am i watching this  movie how did this movie get made it it was it was fucking how did tom cruise hilarious how did tom 
[02:29:30]  cruise agreed to play that role because you don't like jews they were against he's in that  season that fucking scientology thing and what you call fired him rupert murdoch got rid of him and  shit so you don't like jews that scene made me more of a tom cruise fan i i wasn't a huge tom  cruise big hairy arms but after seeing what he did in tropic thunder i'm like you know what i i gotta  respect tom cruise a little more now i i'm gonna see hangover i got to i'm gonna because i have 
[02:30:00]  i'm gonna see it i i don't even know if you're gonna like it i don't really let me think because  because when he kicked that phone out that kid's hand and that kid look that look that kid gave i  said i gotta see this and then mike tyson because i seen a movie called black and white that a buddy of  mine told me about that mike tyson was in oh yeah and the whole movie was improv'd you see mike tyson might be  a fucking acting genius really and i'm gonna tell you who else is gonna be big too slow down with 
[02:30:30]  this black and white that's the movie that starts out with the uh the young couple having sex in the  middle of the park right yes that is a hot scene it's a that movie's crazy dude white girl's in it  white girls bending over just just getting it alan houston's in it it's a it's crazy that movie's crazy  yeah i'm gonna tell you who's coming back oh i'm gonna tell you right now on this show let's go  who michael jordan big star again todd bridges what oh guarantee fact you want to make sure 
[02:31:00]  he was a runner-up on celebrity wrestling what you're talking about patrice todd bridges okay he  does this wait was it along came polly by the way which one because the ben stiller no it was um  it was the other one the heartbreak kid all right heartbreak kid okay which is funny  along came polly's not that yeah all right um but ben still is funny in every movie he's one of  those guys if you just watch what he's doing in a movie every time he's funny you know i might i  might say i might agree with you because he does he does a lot of subtle shit that's that makes you 
[02:31:30]  been in a bunch of bombs but if you really look at his performance he did his job he's he's funny in  bad movies he really is you know what i think you got a point because he is he he doesn't annoy me he's  the movies might bug me but he's because i didn't like along came polly but some of the stuff he did  in that was really fun a little controversy here yeah uh some people saying um matrix reloaded  wrong made more money wrong passion wrong really wrong here's another good question they're wrong

[02:34:30]  blow the fuck up we'll make that happen so are we doing wrestling or john and kate wrestling the  john and kate is what are these clips worth playing uh yeah where are you bro uh yeah all right try that  i'm all over the place today all right yeah well let's do john and kate quick and then do wrestling all  right john and kate uh had a big announcement on their show last night we're trying to be more  in the know so yeah well i called this so long ago yeah this is the thing they they did this like uh 
[02:35:00]  build up for like two weeks saying on this day john and kate have a huge announcement and i'm sitting  there and i'm like from the beginning of season one when jess my girlfriend was watching i'm like jess  these people are separated they're not in the same house on any episode like they're obviously don't  they don't live together since season one no no the first episode of this oh yeah yeah yeah it was  obvious right know what happened with this i was discussing this over the weekend john and kate  had a normal life as far as normalcy could be in their situation and then people got to john and said 
[02:35:30]  wow your wife's a cunt yep because she was no for real and said what the  fuck why are you taking this shit we were and he would have just taken them  he would have taken he would have taken that shit for the end until the end of time but because he's  on tv people started talking to him and he he was embarrassed he's like oh fuck everyone knows that  i'm sap everyone knows i'm a sap yeah and then my wife's a twat yeah well she certainly was and you 
[02:36:00]  know i and that's how it all went down he did he did not know that because if if you watched uh some of  the past seasons of john and kate they were just this family that had eight fucking kids and that's  all he knew the fun of the show was that she was a bitch and he would put up with it and he'd take  it right but he didn't know that do you understand what i'm saying right he had no clue he was just  gonna live till america saw it yeah he sort of knew but he was dealing with it he didn't know how bad  it was wait a minute all of america thinks i'm a i'm a i'm a pushover yeah because he was yeah it's 
[02:36:30]  terrible and then at the same time i also think because i've watched wrestling for so long i think that  everything that happens on television is probably a work so i figure that this big announcement  would have to be that they're getting they're renewing their vows work what does that mean sam  what do you don't understand you work hard to put on a good show so this is how the announcement  this is whatever it is who knows what could it be john there's been a lot in the press here lately  um can you clear the air and fill us in on what's going on between you and kate yeah um 
[02:37:00]  uh kate and i have decided to separate yes we uh wow have decided um that we will separate  i try to contemplate and think about it and would it be better for us it's just not good for our kids  for us to be arguing in front of our kids and it just we can't be cordial with one another then  did you see the pussy that i uh that i'm with now yeah so obviously they were lying when uh when they 
[02:37:30]  were saying no we're not sleeping with other people we're very much uh still together in this  marriage yes sure they wanted to have we can't be cordial with one another then we decide to  separate i'm not very fond of the idea personally um but i know it's necessary because my goal is  peace for the kids so they wanted to wait and have the big reveal on their tv show yeah that's how much  they actually care about their family yes let's make sure we get really good ratings yeah yeah 
[02:38:00]  that's these people suck they really are despicable the kids uh will remain living in their house i've  always called this their house uh i will remain here as well uh during john will probably be able to  afford a little piece of land in a shanty town he's gonna stay in the college dorm with the girl he's  banging that's a better angle actually as well uh during um my um portion of having them um john will 
[02:38:30]  also come here when it is his days and we will flip-flop that way they love it here this is their house  we bought this house for them not for us holy  shit what this is sacrificing christ enough for the martyrdom what this woman is gonna do to this  guy in a divorce oh yeah oh this is gonna be epic child support for eight kids unless oh unless 
[02:39:00]  she's banging that bodyguard then she might let him off the hook a little bit well the thing is she's  the type of person that would continue doing the reality show right so i could easily see a spin-off  of just like kate the single mom that has to deal with the whole world against her and eight kids  yeah and she can't be a bitch to anybody yeah she's just dragging home just dragging home  fucking stray guys every night and banging them would be hysterical she just wants to emasculate 
[02:39:30]  someone yeah she just turns into a slut i don't know what i don't know what happened but she is doable  now yeah how the fuck did that happen they slapped her together pretty uh you see the older pictures  of her and then the pictures after she had the kids no way you wouldn't give her a second  glance yeah yeah you wouldn't give her a second glance a woman that has had eight kids spit out  of her is now doable they had a man they must have tied that shit in a knot they had those bikini  pictures when she was what in north carolina doable yeah would you do it let me look at uh one of the 
[02:40:00]  pictures somebody said this to bing would you sam you're no danny because the search engine was  switched to bing whatever danny would have seen that where was danny danny's got like 18 000 hours  of vacation time and sick time that expires so he's like what the fuck i'm not taking it's pretty  much gonna be aunt and i doing the show for the next two months as everyone gets their vacation time 
[02:40:30]  in everyone squeaks their fucking sick time and this fucking place does it by the book so they got  no rollover there's no no there's nothing with this company how is that more productive when people then  have to go i just i have to take off yeah yeah instead of just saying it rolls over whatever that's  why i took yesterday off and you should take a few fucking days and you have to return the favor  now you know i know yeah all right the favor between right now the favor between me and ann is 
[02:41:00]  is a it's a good one when all suddenly ann emails me and goes i need tomorrow off i'm like i'm gonna  surprise you with one of those that's what i need a surprise give you a good surprise i don't want to  be prepared i want like fucking middle afternoon dude i'm feeling like i need a personal day tomorrow  oh i surprise me with that well you're starting to think about the next day's show and you're like  god all right we got that oh yeah what what no no no no show yeah that's how i was yesterday  make sure it's a friday sunday just make sure it's a friday friday no actually midweek is 
[02:41:30]  thursday midweek is weird those are the best days off for some reason i don't know why but so like  instead of having a nice long weekend the the midweek day off out of nowhere is nice that is really  nice makes the week fly by uh she's all right there is definitely some damage that was done i said  doable i didn't say like make that bigger let me see let me say hi to brandon california as you  make that picture bigger for patrice o'neill brandon hey boys what's going on hey man hey i got two 
[02:42:00]  quick things one about john and kate on that last clip she just said that uh she's gonna stay in their  house and when it's his time to visit he's gonna come in the house yeah so is she gonna stay there too  or she gonna uh go somewhere else i think she probably will be somewhere else they're being nice right  now but this is gonna get uh really really ugly just up in the room having sex yeah while he's  downstairs in the basement yeah because he's she's still got to get him back for banging like the co-ed 
[02:42:30]  yeah if that's what really happened uh what's the second thing there brandon you ruined the u.s  open for me why i cannot watch golf it doesn't matter if tigers on his coach shot 190 yards out  as soon as he hits the balls get in the fucking hole yeah you hear it every fucking time it doesn't  matter where he's at or what swing he's on and they do it for him it ruins it yeah i uh i 
[02:43:00]  fucked up yesterday at the u.s open because uh i think i might have cost phil mickelson the uh the  u.s open because on on 17 i was pretty close and you know you know you had a nice size putt for par  and i said do it for amy i thought that was the nice thing to do oh you are one of the ones screaming  that he's back i would no no he's taking care of his man boobs would you say good luck bro i just  said do it for amy because she's gonna have a little breast cancer surgery soon yeah i figured that 
[02:43:30]  would be nice to do oh now the pressure was on him and then all of a sudden oh that went 15 feet  past the hole oh oh oh what is she carrying that stupid little pail for that picture by the way  she's taking care of her kids let's do some wrestling  shit and then we got a fine penthouse pet coming in here pet of the year yes of 2007  what 2007 is that like three years ago that's correct why because it's penthouse years 
[02:44:00]  oh shit that's penthouse years she could have been the fucking pet of the year in 2000 because i'm  looking here what what what issue are you looking at right now i'm looking at 2007 march march of 2007  all right but the point is what year what what issues out right now december 2009 what month are  they up to probably they do that they like that's what i mean that's what i'm getting they put those  issues out yeah all right what do we got on uh vince mcmahon and donald trump well we learned last 
[02:44:30]  week here on the op and anthony show we got the exclusive scoop that donald trump purchased  monday night raw what a shock that was when vince announced that uh yeah that he was buying it  donald trump trump was buying basically came to vince and made him an offer that he couldn't  refuse yeah he didn't disclose how much money it was but obviously it was a lot and uh and then  donald trump came out and said i'm the owner now and next week we're doing a commercial free broadcast 
[02:45:00]  and i will be there i can't see this going well for for the viewers no for i mean for for uh  uh all parties involved in this business transaction you don't see any winners no i see  everyone trying to screw each other i bet well they're all very shrewd businessmen is that what  it is you don't get to become a billionaire by being nice to people no that's true  this is so stupid i love it though vince rules yeah he's the best devin from new hampshire 
[02:45:30]  gotta back up for a slight minute here we were talking about kate and whether you would do her  or not yeah he writes i'd finger bang kate but i'm sure that pussy is like a bicycle tire  that's pretty bad all right well let's get into the audio donald trump addresses the crowd yeah this  is the beginning of raw last night when donald trump the new owner of raw and there were trump signs 
[02:46:00]  is he a big heel no no no no he's he's a baby face he's he's really he's there because he's giving  the fans uh trump is a face on there commercial free broadcast he's giving to the fans now did he  have music when he came out yeah it was the uh ripoff of uh money money money money right how much  how much money do you think it cost them though to pay to buy raw pay for for three hours of no four  well here's the thing it was technically a commercial free two hours raw but every 15 
[02:46:30]  minutes they went over to the commentary table and let me tell you something jr and the king  both love uh soup right right okay okay okay okay okay okay they was doing live reads  son of a bitch two full buckets the whole time i gotta tell you king this is some good chicken  oh my god oh my god king they never talk about food usually get me another goddamn chicken leg 
[02:47:00]  sam said they never talk about food usually but yeah but commercial free i guess they put in some of  their personality what an asshole yeah that's great even though i own monday night raw and i love it  was he at least live this time instead of vince talking to a tape of donald trump and making  believe they were having an interaction that's not proven one way but yes he was they did the  big setup there patrice you weren't here for this so vince is talking and then donald trump pops up on 
[02:47:30]  the screen and you think oh wow they're gonna have a little interaction now but vince was actually  talking to a videotape of donald trump there was a little bit every so often he'd be like well i i  i well but but but i think i and he couldn't cut in because it's a video that was done already  well no it's because donald trump is a powerful talker oh is that it yeah so they were he was at  least there live if he was there and there were all like the big signs that said it had the trump  logo oh wow and on the mic flags on the big screens everything said trump even though i own monday 
[02:48:00]  night raw and i love it i've always loved it this is your show not mine it's your show  to show you a little bit about that tonight on television millions of people  commercial free no commercials no nothing  i love it more importantly chicken for the people that are here tonight 
[02:48:30]  not only are you getting world championship matches better than vince would have ever given  you believe me but after the show is over i'm giving you a full refund of whatever the hell you pay  that's unbelievable  that's unbelievable is it no is it really and that's got to just drive because you know vince 
[02:49:00]  mcmahon loves what's it all about it's all about the money  and so that's got to drive vince crazy actually is refunding for this bit they actually did raw  commercial free and refunded everybody's tickets that's insane yes how did they give everyone's money  back the guy i don't know they got it i wasn't there was the people had to leave and like  to get the money back we got to smell it maybe mail it yeah it'll make it hard so they said they're 
[02:49:30]  doing it after the event so send it on an eight by ten postcard but uh um vince wasn't having as  easy a night as donald trump was oh in fact what happened his limo broke down oh no in the middle of  but i don't know some cow field or something out here in this god forsaken part of the country  with a cameraman and a mic  for a limo driver it seems as though trump has my limo and i have the i have the backup i've got 
[02:50:00]  the lemon so what do we propose to do here huh you tell me what's your plan limo driver sir the  the nearest gas station is not too far away great acting sir and he's mic'd right sir triple a  i had never heard of it sir sir gold on star no no nearest gas station is what is this a horror  movie was the police maybe your private helicopter i've never heard hello twitter yeah send me a 
[02:50:30]  new limo god damn it i need a limo tea yeah fine was the limo driver ripped someone twitter me a limo  the limo driver was bald and had like a goatee and oh yeah of course yeah the limo driver is one of  the guys that want to be a wrestler they just dress him up in a limo or a wrestler down in his  luxor vince gave him a little payday oh i got i gotta hear the rest did you say gas station yes sir 
[02:51:00]  do you realize i've never been to a gas station in my life you expect me to go to a gas station what's your  other plan pal you better have a good one he's just a giant 75 year old brick house bad actor he  just built like a a battleship and and all the pressure he puts on his poor wrestlers and he's 
[02:51:30]  just this bad of an actor holy never been to a gas station in my life life really berating another  grown man yeah just get gas and let's go yeah what are you talking about where's the problem  here i don't see a big problem here well the thing what's going on sam he has to use the backup limo  because trump got the good mcmahon limo because trump's the owner now was that in the deal then  then vince made a bad business deal well it's probably the raw the limo for raw so obviously whoever 
[02:52:00]  owns raw would probably get the best limo so the other millionaire gets the shitty the lemon the  the lemon the other millionaire yeah one millionaire to another or billionaire two billionaires one gets  a shitty limo that needs gas he should consider himself lucky this one didn't explode that's  think about it though when you've got the owner of a branch of a company and then the owner of the 
[02:52:30]  whole company who's going to get the better limo the owner of the branch why why that's kind of  the way it works you get your own it's like if two billionaires you go like for for retirement get  one gets a rolex the other one gets like a timex right you can still throw the timex in the garbage  and get yourself a fucking rolex like toss that fucking limo away and get a better limo why isn't he  in a helicopter or his jet yeah well i guess donald trump probably must have got the jet too i guess 
[02:53:00]  that makes sense oh he got the jet so he came in the jet came in with the deal probably i mean  it wasn't on tv bad deal bad business deal it continues the limo problem little problems well  sir the arena's not too far away we could walk  walk you know what we are going to walk that is you're going to walk turn around turn around  he's piggybacking on him you get on the phone and you call your boss and you tell him i'm not going 
[02:53:30]  anywhere i don't care how long it takes i'm riding to the arena in a limo and you're not gonna drive  now the video i'm looking at is that the arena in the background that's what that's the  fucking arena man it's like it they fucking like it's right there they couldn't go somewhere where  it was but it wasn't in the face yeah turn the angle the other way so you don't even see the arena 
[02:54:00]  he hasn't walked he's vincent kennedy mcmahon and he is a fucking big human being you see how big he was  to this guy just kicking him in his ass that's what he treats the fucking limo guys he's kicking  him down the street in his ass just a giant human being hey you got a piggyback ride from the limo  driver right so he piggybacks the limo driver yep he finally gets to raw yep he knocks on donald trump 
[02:54:30]  he knocks on the door that he thinks is his office uh-oh guess whose name is on it  donald trump oh you ruined it yeah i hope he did get it donald j trump it was donald trump  who informed him uh your locker room is over your office is over there uh-oh so he goes okay that's  weird so he has to go through the office or the locker room to get to his office and he looks and  gold dust and hornswoggle have to tell him the new tag team have to tell him that's your office right 
[02:55:00]  there and there's a sign on one of the bathroom stalls that says mr mcmahon so at this point  how could one of the bathroom stalls be his office come on you know who the owner is donald trump yep  there's not two offices i think donald wants to stick it to him how many weeks did donald trump  agree to is this one exactly here's the thing one so does he work for vince well no he owns raw so but  does vince work for him still i guess why is vince in offices in the first place he's so raw 
[02:55:30]  just go away they're doing a power struggle storyline because vince wants to go on raw and  do his farewell speech that's why he's here today oh and then and say that it's gonna be donald trump's  company but yes well no raw the brand will be his the branch of the company i bet you it doesn't  work out but now the branch of the company but doesn't vince own wwe baby yeah  why wasn't this in the new york times why wasn't this in the new york times or or the wall street  or cnbc this is pretty big you know why why wasn't this in the wall street this is a big 
[02:56:00]  huge acquisition this would be a huge acquisition we all know that we all know how cnbc works as far  as journalism so i've we don't have any faith in them anymore good points this kid has an answer for  everything yes he does all right let's find out what happens with the new office he's no no we  skipped the office because the audio is whatever oh but he's fed up so now he's gone to the ring to  talk to donald trump oh it's the office and the limo and donald trump giving away all this money 
[02:56:30]  he's at it he's had it he's gotta dress the crowd of donald trump i had no idea you're gonna do this  commercial free stuff okay i lose a lot of money with no commercials and someone told me you're thinking  about doing it each and every week and i gotta tell you that's not gonna happen you give everybody  here in green bay their money back that's gonna happen these people in green bay they don't deserve 
[02:57:00]  to have their money back there's another rumor that you're going around that you're gonna let raw be  free every week so these rumors every week every week these every week these rumors are true  you can't have commercial free raw every week you can't have a free live attendance at raw you can't do that 
[02:57:30]  that i'd i'd be if you did that in six months time i'd be bankrupt let me just tell you a couple  of things vince number one this is peanuts i paid a big price for well you know that a big price did i  i can do whatever the hell i want all right whatever the hell oh wow wow trump's acting oh my god amazing  is this happening it's riveting wow it's just amazing it's not technically acting it's just 
[02:58:00]  public speaking oh is that what it is yeah all right let's uh move through these clips is  horrendous acting on both of their parts like he can't even vince who is normally um  olivier with these things okay uh can't even act off of donald because donald is so incredibly bad  well here's what it is have you ever done a multi-million dollar bill you have okay have you  ever done a multi-million dollar possibly billion dollar deal with people like vince mcmahon and 
[02:58:30]  donald trump uh-huh in front of millions of people on in television in front of a live usually these  things are kept to a office boardroom conference rooms things like that i mean speech patterns are all  thrown off it's both men are out of their element they don't like all this attention oh okay all they  hate it attention oh yeah yeah that's very obvious there yes sam's got an answer for  everything as far as wrestling goes they're more behind the scenes boardroom types how old are you 
[02:59:00]  i'm 25 all right just just making sure yeah acting 10 all right well uh vince tries to make a a new deal  with yes with donald trump look okay i'll let's make a deal i i know i know what you're thinking and  i admit all right you've uh you're smarter than me all right i admit that and you've got me in here  in a bit of a bind okay so let's do this how about if i were to buy raw back i would pay you the same 
[02:59:30]  amount of money you paid me we'd shake hands and everything would be fine why would he do that  that's a bad deal why would he do that was this a hostile takeover by the way no donald trump came  to vincent man with a very nice offer very you know exuberant offer okay and vincent man accepted  and then a week later he goes holy shit yes that that that deal was bad and why was this a bad deal  because me being that it was such a wonderful deal in the first place because first it was just like  i'll give you this much money for raw and that's like awesome yeah but now donald trump is gonna stop 
[03:00:00]  playing commercials and uh giving away free tickets to what difference does it make to the  man who no longer owns raw but he doesn't own raw but he owns the company right it's like a subsidiary  of wwe and what happens so he's trying so here's what donald trump did yeah he bought something for  a lot of money yeah to to not make money with it just to see he has so much money that he bought raw so  that he can stick it to vince you got the entire wow you got it yes this was all planned by donald trump 
[03:00:30]  all along say i didn't know that stick it to vince so he's almost like a quarterback who purposely  throws interceptions yeah yep that's what he could lose his contract for throwing interceptions but  to get at the entire team the vengeance is worth it yeah that's right and wouldn't you have to offer  him more money than he paid well he's already put some time into it there's probably been a lot of  lawyers that have been paid to to a broker this deal you don't just do it yourself he's banking 
[03:01:00]  on you know it's it's complicated you have to run a whole live tv look maybe you're in over your head  maybe i'm in over your head i'll give you your money back money back shake hands and we're still  pals but why doesn't he just let raw go vinceman man and then just just create another product ah that's  a good idea just just tell him take it away i don't even want to see you anymore so that is not a  liability so so so the gigs you try to do this i'm gonna make something else so trump in the deal  trump said i'm gonna buy raw but the stipulation is that i stay under you yeah the umbrella of of uh 
[03:01:30]  of wwe has to be you at any time even though you're technically still my boss why doesn't he just make  something like medium rare he'll call it medium rare and then they could fight in that first of all  medium rare is not uncut uncooked and uncensored that's first and foremost medium rare i didn't  even catch that shit i went way over my head for the first second fucking medium rare so bad 
[03:02:00]  and raw's been like you know vince's baby for over why would he sell his baby a lot of money  he sold his baby for a lot of money the money under the guys that that vince i mean under the guys  that donald trump runs a uh a a comparable company would do the right under his umbrella yes right  can we get through these horseshit clips we got a pet of we got a pet of the year uh down the hall  there sam big deal 
[03:02:30]  vince no interest whatsoever no interest  uh okay all right all right how many of you like to see me pay donald  50 more than what he paid that's a fair deal  and i want you to accept it right now yeah you know vince that's good for some people it's not  good for me no deal all right 75 no no no no no no all right you get double your money back 
[03:03:00]  we've got a deal double your money back  you said double your money back shut up shut up  you can't go back on your word you said double your money back i'm giving you double your money  back we've got a deal i've got to do that you've got a deal what the twice as much 
[03:03:30]  there it is vince mcmahon's raw again that's the end oh fuck me man can you believe that it was a  one week thing for fried chicken and fucking donald trump can you believe it but he lost  it lost a lot of money a lot of money and they wonder why their ratings are down sam the  ratings are down just me it's it's symptomatic of the way television is it's the internet it's 
[03:04:00]  not the quality of programming how about donald trump pumps up his last line a little bit  no all right you got a deal no no you got a deal but vince is very angry about losing all that  money there's got to be and here's this progression i'll give you 25 50  75 75 wow where's this 100 100 i will bump it up 25 each and each this isn't this negotiation is  brutal within within seconds of one offer where's this he just goes back up to another 25 
[03:04:30]  at it i'll give you 25 25 50 75 no double your body back 100 that's where these deals are made  he didn't even go he didn't even go 26 no well i mean people work in terms of quarters because it's  easier you know especially when you're spur of the moment like in terms of options he didn't bring in  like you know maybe stock options or something or let my lawyer talk to your lawyer from 100 
[03:05:00]  million to 25 assets are nothing donald trump obviously bought this raw brand just solely in  cash he wrote a check and said here's how much money you get no sam that's not true fitzman's  going to give him a check worth two times the first check i hope he says that's just not app that  didn't happen it didn't happen shut up you're ruining this deal which you're ruining our deal in  front of virtual primates in the audience he's making a giant business deal and donald trump is 
[03:05:30]  like what do you think huh no don't take 50 percent my advisor look at him in the ring no no no no i  have a feeling donald trump loves being on tv really oh he certainly loves that tv uh wow there's one more  clip left i wonder what's gonna happen i wonder what's gonna happen ant do you guys want to go around  the table and guess what vince mcmahon does next wow okay so oh wow does he i don't know i certainly 
[03:06:00]  hope what do you think i don't know sam i couldn't even venture a guess let me just tell you one other  thing one other thing oh if you ever ever crossed my path again  if i ever see you no matter where it doesn't matter i ever see that trump logo anywhere around me  i'll knock you on your billionaire's butt  why not right now oh 
[03:06:30]  another thing mr trump  about the only thing i can say to you here tonight is donald trump yeah  even before they signed the deal  just slapped mr mcmahon he slapped him in the face 
[03:07:00]  all right look at donald trump's head yeah and i got hair i don't know what that's all about  i have to jump in here wait till you hear this oh damn he smacked mr mcmahon wait till you hear  this gino s from philly only reason this tanked was because shareholders were fuming because this  bit lost their money stocks dropped by eight percent after the announcement and the government 
[03:07:30]  stepped in the government had to step in hold on uh stepped in can't be lying about a new owner  and then aaron from boston the donald trump angle only lasted a week since investors in the wwe are  dumb and thought that they actually sold raw causing stock prices to fall about seven to eight  percent sec is considering an investigation into this this is a man who's almost died multiple times  in the ring there's no investigation because i bet you this thing was supposed to last way more 
[03:08:00]  than a week of course well i mean like what the security is separating them i don't see this being  the end of the vince mcmahon donald trump feud well that's true they gotta move over look at the  security guards for the sake of uh the stockholders vince isn't even trying to get to him  well he's very much in shock wow he's yelling nobody's signed the paperwork yet yeah that's true  he fired before he actually signed it yeah he's got to and i'll tell you why verbal  contract and everybody saw it on tv oh so that's probably why he did it on tv yeah verbal 
[03:08:30]  contracts i was thinking it's silly to be on tv they should be in a board room or something but  25 okay 50 no 75 okay 75 no damn it okay 100 no okay 125 no  okay okay 150 oh no  all right 200 that's it yes all right you tripled your money you got it 
[03:09:00]  the only thing i can hope very shrewd is that i hope this whole trump mcmahon thing gets resolved  by the end of the summer why i guess i mean just because it would end the season nicely it would  also coincide nicely with summer slam oh well yeah yeah it would you want to get bad blood out  of the way by the end of the season well so you think trump's coming back monday next monday well  vince mcmahon is not going to just let somebody slap him in the face on television and be like okay 
[03:09:30]  he fired him though yeah he fired him as the owner of what raw but not as his but not as an evil  competitor right donald trump now now is doubly rich yeah he has more money to fight vince mcmahon  he's got a lot of vince mcmahon's money and people forget this matter of fact he can offer vince mcmahon  the exact amount that he accepted in the first place maybe 25 more and still come out 25 ahead 
[03:10:00]  75 ahead and people forget this too it was only a couple years ago people say remember when vince mcmahon  was bald remember when he got shaved bald yes yes who's the guy that was yes donald trump the  donald himself so you think another hair match there's just bad blood between the two well obviously  i could see that i don't know if a hair match because vince mcmahon doesn't have his patented  pompadour hairdo anymore oh my god look at bob bob buckler looks dead he was like the crib keeper 
[03:10:30]  why did it have to be ed mcmahon oh my god that's all i'm saying after hearing that his hair looks  hard like it's hard man has gone through so many near-death experiences in his day  yeah well i know things almost falling on him the limo exploding thank god he blew up his limo  himself just to see if the fans still loved him that was the best excuse ever for there's been a giant  real tragedy in the wwe and i need to come out and make a statement and i can't be dead i mean many 
[03:11:00]  people would have died when he wait randy orton kicked him in the head as hard as he could well  oh with that shin that evil that randy orton's new finishing move the mistake kick like the oh  shit i fucked up and kicked him in the head but that was really good so now that's my new ending  move is a big kick in the head are we still talking about wrestling uh sort of uh sort of  kind of going over uh what the fuck i did a tap out about 20 minutes ago well i mean so many different 
[03:11:30]  things could happen yeah it's an unpredictable world yeah hopefully one of them is that you leave the  studio what do you that has nothing to do with wrestling sam roberts everyone thank you sam  thank you sam we're gonna who's coming in next there uh there steve uh pet house pet heather vandevin  nice is she cool yeah she's very cool will she get naked and stuff yeah absolutely really  absolutely and then what happens um well i'll let you take a look at her her supplemental sheet when

[03:14:00]  that's fine he's hot i could have told me in advance this could mess up our interview i'm thinking  no it's not like her boyfriend or anything look at how pissed kenny is because that's not angry if she  thinks this is angry you're sadly mistaken all right i just said to you very nicely you just  can't invite people into the studio without asking i goodbye was in with steve and he saw him there  and i didn't see steve didn't say you can't bring him in and i didn't think there's anything wrong 
[03:14:30]  steve had nothing to do with you and the guests coming into the studio producer of the show eric is  the one that escorted you in you can just say it like that he's not the producer of the show  is steve not the producer of the show i think we've been trying to figure that out for years  who scored you in the room who scored you in the room oh oh heather there were a few people  who scored me in the room no no there was one person skinny weight if you're gonna if we're 
[03:15:00]  gonna be real here there was one person that escorted into the room was eric all right so how  how does eric turn into a few people explain that one it's steve eric and you so that's three  people who escorted you into the room i didn't escort you into the room so you're you're mistaken  on another account oh can't we all just get along you guys eric who scored laney into the room  exactly okay now who truth be told is this a lover's quarrel truth be told what happened who says that 
[03:15:30]  have i just said it all right kenny just knew i needed time to eat okay  all right you know that's fine okay hey why don't you like laney do whatever you want what you don't  like laney she's brought some fine guests over the years yeah i i i don't like her or dislike her you  know she i've seen her here before i say hello to her i'm very cordial all right but but the studio  on the show is not a free-for-all she can't just be inviting people in i i didn't bring an entourage 
[03:16:00]  i brought one person in which i never do ever i feel responsible for this i brought my friend  james don't you ever feel responsible for anything yeah james is great he's he's you're fine he's a fun  dude you're fine don't even worry how do we blame eric yeah how can we pass the blame onto eric  how can we blame eric why can't we we can blame you we can say it's your fault there it's your fault  now wow kenny's hot for some reason yeah why are you hot because i hate getting the blame for something 
[03:16:30]  when i didn't do nothing if i did something wrong i'm the first one to admit it and i'll take my lumps  but i don't like being falsely accused of nothing it was iraq iraq yeah it's yeah right  why would you just you you screwed everything up tricks i didn't do i didn't fucking up anything  here language in front of a lady i know this video of her getting you know tongues put in her ass but

[03:17:30]  i whispered it i didn't scream it was some hardcore right uh yeah some hardcore girl  all right let's uh let's focus on heather i was just looking because i was watching the video  yeah girl girl girl yeah yeah yeah never did girl guy or anything no no you know and and the girl girl  um i've only done some really nice high-end work yeah so i'm choosy about it right  yeah careful about it so i'm kind of looking at that and it was pretty good

[03:35:30]  wait but do you have great fantasies um i like i like being i like being overpowered but i don't  uh i don't want to be scared no violence like so so doing scenarios um smack around scenes yeah  yeah no being smacked being smacked just to be smacked no because if it turns you on and it turns  me on then yes you know yeah let's smack that she's still trying to maintain like a little bit of

[03:48:00]  a number of years really she knows how to fight i'm a veteran you must have been something you must  have did well with those guns yeah  it was meant to be like zero concentration and she walked by in my uh in my basic training they  voted me the hottest girl in basic training but i probably the hottest girl ever i trained right  alongside with the men i ran the miles i learned how to shoot m16s i was right there with them your 
[03:48:30]  aunt is in love i got jody foster man she isn't fucking she's she's not with heather there i got  some guns at home some ar-15s shotguns pistols got a desert eagle okay nice 50 cal we go to the range  blast a few off oh she shoots and shoots the gun naked you just beat off that now that that's creepy  enough for me to watch her shoot and she's good and i am like a sniper shot and i can see an  asshole in the distance black sock on my dick oh no or get a paint gun how dirty is this i have 
[03:49:00]  i have a story about socks and dicks all righty all right let's hear this well um i just finished a  couple uh softcore series for hbo and cinemax oh sorry what was that no sorry someone's taking a  video no no no not anymore sorry go ahead okay i'm listening hbo cinemax life on top and this other  show called lingerie that i filmed in toronto and the other one i filmed in romania so anyways this 
[03:49:30]  i'm new to doing softcore with men and it's not real sex right it's simulated right and and i put a  band-aid basically on my pussy and then they in romania they didn't get the memo that you're supposed  to have like a special thing you put on the mills they literally gave them like dress socks or or  running socks and they're like here you go this is what you put on your cock like i thought that  was hilarious and then and then for me related sex is just rubbing that back and forth right right 
[03:50:00]  with the sock on the cock and um for me thank god i had a sock fetish otherwise it would be very  strange really be odd to have to be really sexy with a guy and he's sitting there with an athletic  sock hanging from his cock or as a kid if i didn't want to make a mess i'd jerk off into like a  fucking in a sock white sock all right now easily cleaned you just go to sleep let mom put it in  the washing machine the dishwasher or washing machine or whatever the hell she puts it  wow hey why don't why don't you like michael bay the director of transformers um well i observed his 
[03:50:30]  behavior on set i he did this movie called the island and i was hired basically as a glorified extra my  character was pretty girl from the future so i was on pretty girl eight from the right exactly  and uh so i was on set and i've done i've done a lot of work mainstream and erotic and so i've seen  people's behavior but his behavior on set was out of control he screamed profanity and just yelled at 
[03:51:00]  everyone on the crew no respect for anyone and for me i'm all about giving people their respect  and he just you know he stomped over everyone and obviously he's in the position he's in because  he's a great director and because he's not afraid to step on people but for me i find it grotesque so  michael bay well he's not impressed he's done pretty well though yeah unfortunately he doesn't care 
[03:51:30]  what i think yeah he's like what he doesn't care can't hear it over the rumble of the brinks truck  yeah yeah and and what about mick jagger mick jagger my famous mick jagger story is i spent  three days with him in vegas we did not have sex uh i met him through mutual friend but we did make  out and uh all about and you would you would think that mick jagger would be this incredible maker  outer because well as we know he's he doesn't have to make out though he's mick jagger well he doesn't 
[03:52:00]  have to but he did and here's the thing here's the thing um i had to stop him mid make out and say  this isn't working i'm gonna have to give you a few lessons here because he had the tendency of  course to shove his entire tongue into my mouth and that's gross when people do that the technique  to french kissing well is half you know you put your tongue half out they put their tongue half out  and you know you meet in the middle and he didn't quite get that concept so we worked on it for a 
[03:52:30]  while he got much better but he still has while still has a bit to learn yeah i guess that's how  like david bowie liked it or something oh right down his throat unless someone's gagging he doesn't  think it's good well we're going to be off the air in a few minutes here laney we do good  yes you make up with kenny everything's fine with kenny now forever now  did you hate him he acted like a new jersey guido bouncer oh get kenny back in here  new jersey guido bouncer oh no by the way it's heather vandeven vandeven vandeven i'm sorry v-a-n-d-e-v-e-n
