<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a defiant declaration against being "nice" on the air, immediately setting the tone for the broadcast.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with studio guests Jimmy and Kenny, launched into a series of loosely connected conversations.  Opie expressed disappointment over the lack of humorous commentary surrounding Heath Ledger's death. Kenny recounted a near-miss with a dump truck, sparking jokes about his driving and sleep habits.  A substantial portion of the show detailed Anthony's appearance on *Red Eye*, including humorous anecdotes and played clips of his jokes.  The AIG death threats were discussed, followed by a crude discussion about Chris Brown and Rihanna's situation and teen girls’ reactions.  Opie's "psychotic" Twitter pictures were analyzed, with comparisons to various characters. Opie recounted an incident on the *Ron & Fez* show that caused Fez an emotional breakdown. Bobo, a regular listener, arrived early, prompting conversation about his journey and lost wallet.  Obama's use of a suicide bomber metaphor was criticized, alongside a discussion of his public image. The hosts reminisced about Markie Post's attractiveness. Plans for a "meat party" at a Brazilian steakhouse were detailed, followed by vulgar comments about a former workplace and its owner. The show also included listener calls and featured a discussion of Uncle Jack, a former bar owner's alleged cocaine dealings and employee mistreatment. A caller shared a story about an expensive dinner and his resentment toward an under-tipping bar owner. Jimmy’s high-speed BMW incident with a state trooper was recounted, with Kenny's police experience helping him avoid a ticket.  A graphic description of one host's sexual experience followed, along with humorous comparisons of audience members’ physical attributes to film characters. Obama’s appearance on Jay Leno, and his criticism of AIG bonuses were discussed, along with the ethical implications and political maneuvering involved.  Vinny from the Stress Factory, his son, and a humorous anecdote about his son's sudden early-morning motivation were mentioned.  Lisa Sparks was mentioned as an upcoming guest, along with comments on her physique.  A commercial featuring "Nanopuss" was discussed, along with more off-color commentary.

The Nannerpuss meme from a Denny's commercial dominated a segment, featuring Travis performing a Nannerpuss dance and Vinny expressing his dislike.  Obama's joke about his bowling score and the Special Olympics was discussed along with the resulting controversy.  An audio clip from *Ron & Fez* showcasing the forced removal of Opie and Anthony’s intern, David, was played, leading to a discussion on strategies for David to successfully introduce another intern, Scott, to Ron and Fez. Bobo, Stalker Patty, and Lisa Sparks (mentioned but not heard) were present. Several Kansas City audience members were briefly introduced, and the show concluded with a discussion of Eastside Dave, interspersed with numerous anecdotes, jokes, and a song mocking the Special Olympics.  A staff member’s severe diarrhea was also discussed.

A running gag about the guests' New Jersey origins featured prominently. Plans to deliver a “peace offering” to Ron Bennington were debated.  A news story about New Jersey considering banning Brazilian waxes led to crude and sexually explicit jokes. Vinny discussed his son's arrest for marijuana possession and subsequent five-month stay in an abandoned truck. A chaotic game of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" concluded the segment.

A prolonged and chaotic game involving various props ensued, including a ShamWow-like product demonstration gone wrong, a misused wig, a black man’s thong used to create a makeshift pope hat, and a hard hat.  Jimmy briefly participated.  The hosts attempted a question-only game before shifting to a game using Lisa Sparks’ breasts as a prop, involving Bobo, David, and Patty.  Audience members participated, escalating the silliness. Vinny’s upcoming appearance and a planned prank involving an air horn and peace offerings for Ronnie concluded the segment.  Sexually suggestive comments and jokes were frequent throughout.  Upcoming guest appearances by Vinnie Brand and Lisa Sparks were mentioned.

[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.

[00:04:00]  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  This Heath Ledger, I mean, there was going to be no surprise there.  It was so obvious he was going to win.  And I was disappointed.  I thought we were going to see a corpse.  Too soon.  Too soon.  Did you quit smoking yet?  No, I didn't quit smoking.  Why don't you guys attack him like you attack me?  Quit smoking.  We don't care if he dies.  They don't care about you.  Why don't you shove it?  Shove it like your mother did.  Shove it like your mother takes it.  Your mother, that whore. 
[00:04:30]  That whore.  Think of your mom.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  You know what she does?  She's an effing whore.  She takes it in a dirty spot.  A dirty spot's a big gaping one.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. 
[00:05:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Wow.  Friday?  Really?  I think so.  Yeah.  How'd that happen?  Well, you know.  Yeah, the days go by, I guess.  I guess it's that old earth kind of rotating thing.  It keeps rotating round and round.  Wow.  Obama.  Anthony on red eye.  Jimmy going to Albany and back since we last talked. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  That is insane.  And then Kenny making a ridiculous U-turn right out here.  Yeah.  And wow.  He cut it really close for a conservative guy like he is.  Really?  I think he's a bit tired.  He figured he could make it.  And there was some kind of huge dump truck that wasn't going slow either.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Really?  Yes.  It was too early to be, like, jarred awake like that, Kenny. 
[00:06:00]  Get the adrenaline rush of a truck coming at you.  Oh, my God.  All of a sudden, he's just sitting there, and I feel him just drastically go for it.  You know the go for it move?  Of course.  Just dramatic and sharp turn.  Yeah.  And then I kind of see this dump truck.  Did we really have to be at work at that particular moment?  Yeah.  You could have waited, you know, the 10 seconds.  Sure.  Wow.  Where do we start?  How was Red Eye, man? 
[00:06:30]  Very cool.  Yeah.  They're really great over there.  Nice bunch of peeps.  Uh-huh.  And I had fun.  Yeah.  It was a lot of fun.  It's the first time I did it.  Nice fast-paced going on.  Just, you know, you'd sit there and just joke around.  Are you still in this?  There's one studio, Greg, that I hope you've come to, and then there's another one that  they're using, because that studio we used to do it in, or they used to do it, had O'Reilly's  stuff in it.  He's now going HD. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  So the one, are you in the one now where there's like a bunch of space between you and the table?  Do you have to sit like a foot off the table?  Yeah, you got to kind of sit away.  What?  Because the guy goes, he goes, what's the lighting issue?  It's a lighting issue.  He goes, well, this might be a little odd, but let me pull you away from the table here.  And I'm like, okay, well, this is weird.  But, uh, yeah, yeah, it's in that studio, deep in the bowels of the Fox building.  Yeah.  You're walking around downstairs, like, uh, get smart.  Yeah.  Trying to get to a control.  Isn't that weird?  You're like in the basement or something, and then also, you open up a door, and it's 
[00:07:30]  a beautiful TV studio.  And it's a studio.  And the rest of the area is horrible.  Yeah, it's just a basement.  Yeah.  And you never think, when you're walking through a hallway there, like there's a little dingy  hallway, and then when you go to sit, you're like, they're going to see me all over  the country from walking in this little room.  It's so, the TV's so bizarre.  From going in this little room.  Yeah, it's true.  You go in this little room, and then everyone in the country sees you.  So you had, uh, you were on with, uh, with, uh, Bill Schultz was on every, every night.  Yes.  And, uh, and of course, Greg, and who is the girl? 
[00:08:00]  Uh, what the hell was her name?  Oh, I'm sorry.  God, I'm terrible.  It was, you know, I had just woken from my nap.  She's a very cute girl.  Yeah, she's, I know.  Yeah, you know who it is.  Yeah.  Did you just say you just woke from your nap?  No, no, I, I, well, kinda.  I, I didn't really sleep.  I just had a bunch of naps, uh, yesterday.  I napped.  Napped to your nap.  And then, uh, I had just woken from my nap at the time.  Right.  And I went in there, and, uh, I was kinda, you know, I was looking at the sheets of what 
[00:08:30]  they were gonna be talking about and things like that, and I didn't catch everybody's  name.  Um, but, um.  It's all good.  No, she was very good, and, uh, yeah.  We got a couple highlights.  You wanna hear your highlights?  Oh, you got them?  Oh, I, this is actually good, cause what the guys do when, you know, when we're on TV,  they go in the back room and cut it up.  So, to them, this is the highlights.  Uh-huh.  So, they might have, uh, you know, left something out that you might have enjoyed.  I, uh, no, I don't, I, I, I don't, uh, I don't know if there's anything. 
[00:09:00]  All right, let's see what.  Give a listen.  Let's see what they did.  Here's the big intro for it.  And with us for the first time, Anthony Kumia.  Did I say it right?  Yes, you did.  Oh, fantastic.  I'm here to bring down the good-looking, uh, gauge.  What part of this are you not understanding?  Anyway, for those of you who don't know Anthony, he co-hosts the Opie and Anthony Show weekdays  from 6 a.m. to noon Eastern on XM Radio Channel 202 and Sirius Radio Channel 197, The Virus.  He's so smart, Mensa wants to join him.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  I'm very silly.  They're so silly.  He's come up with a few that were fucking laugh out loud and funny, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Really filthy with it, you know?  Some filthy.  Yeah, like, if someone, she's so hot, if such and such, then I'd come on her.  How the fuck did you pull that one off?  Right.  Uh, it's no Jay Leno intro, Greg.  Oh, it's fine for 3 a.m.  Jesus Christ.  Three in the morning, they play that.  Oh, yeah.  Not on the West Coast, midnight. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Oh!  Yeah, it's on at midnight on the West Coast.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  And I got a few tweets saying it's prime time in England or wherever the hell they were tweeting from.  Yeah.  Because everyone else was bitching that it's at the middle of the night, and somebody wrote,  nope, it's prime time for me, so I don't know where the hell they live.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Like, maybe, would it be Hawaii?  Yeah.  Or Alaska?  Yeah, find out where it's prime time.  Or some little island in the middle of the Pacific.  I think in Guam.  Right.  They're, like, tuning in at 8 p.m. 
[00:10:30]  It's a perfect time.  Perfect for me.  Finally, some TV for me.  Yes, in Guam, the Bikini Island.  Yeah.  According to the newspaper Human Events, some Pentagon analysts believe the number of former, quote,  NAB combatants returning to wage terror has topped 100.  Now, I'm no expert at numbers, but that definitely is a number.  Hey, Anthony, these people, they obviously hate America.  Why would they want to live here?  True.  I think they'd rather stay in Cuba instead of coming to such a socialist nation as the United States at this point. 
[00:11:00]  It truly is.  We have now moved.  We've moved past Cuba.  Yeah.  Let them stay there.  But you have a, I'm sure you have a massive house in the hills somewhere.  Wouldn't you be willing to help the Obama administration by offering a room?  No.  Every room I have right now is being taken up with assault weapons that will be banned in no time.  I don't like the idea of these Gitmo detainees, as they like to be called.  They do like that. 
[00:11:30]  They love that.  Lock them up for half a decade and then let them loose on the people that pretty much locked them up.  I think they're going to be.  They won't be better at all.  In fact, they'll be really happy, I imagine.  I don't know.  I love how your facts get laughs.  My facts.  I have guns all over my house.  He's like, oh, God.  They all thought it was a joke.  He's like, oh, what a comedy genius.  And he's laughing along.  I'm like, no, you idiot.  That's a fact.  He's really a kook.  Oh, look at him with his guns, I bet. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, what a silly line.  Who has a house that has every room?  Every room has guns in it.  That's hilarious.  Right?  I have a big Hitler poster.  That's crazy.  Oh, my gosh.  What a lunatic.  He really comes off as a nut on TV.  Oh, his comedy is just unbelievable.  First, the gun on the seat, and now the dump truck.  If Kenny brings you food, maybe he ought to taste it first.  Food taster.  That's DW. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, my near miss for this week.  I could tell Kenny was a little tired.  He's a lunatic.  We're in the middle of listening to clips of Ann on Red Eye, but he's a lunatic, Jimmy.  Yes, I know he is.  He drove you back and forth to Albany.  No, I drove.  Oh, you drove.  I did 90% of the driving.  Okay.  And me and Jimmy live very close to each other.  So, here's the deal.  He drops Jimmy off in the middle of the night, basically.  So, I go to Kenny yesterday.  I'm like, Kenny, I got an extra room.  It has its own bathroom.  Oh, boy.  Flat screen TV. 
[00:13:00]  You could just let yourself in.  You can mellow out.  Maybe take a shower if you need.  Or, at the very least, just lay there and watch TV.  Because, obviously, the turnaround time is going to be, what, three or four hours tops?  Yeah, very, very brief.  And he's been up since, what, Thursday morning, whatever it would be?  You're talking crazy.  Yeah, he goes, I don't want to be a bother.  And he's kind of frustrated that we're not really friends' friends.  But it's hard to be his friend.  Because he doesn't do, like, what friends do.  Like, your friend would take you up on that and go, wow, that's cool.  You thank you. 
[00:13:30]  I'll try to be quiet.  Blah, blah, blah.  So, this psychopath drove all the way home to Jersey.  He lives somewhere, like, past Newark or something.  Yeah, he lives about 20 minutes, 25 minutes into Newark.  And I go, I went home, I showered, I slept an hour, and I came back.  So, he's on an hour's sleep.  Yeah.  So, the ride from, like, Jimmy's place to Kenny's place has got to be close to 40 minutes.  Goes home for an hour to drive 40 minutes back to come get me and then be here for the show.  He's in the nuts. 
[00:14:00]  I would normally have invited Kenny up, but I didn't last night because my girlfriend was up there.  Yeah, well, you don't want to.  Yeah.  And not that he would peak, but he's such a mood killer.  My dick won't get hard.  Kenny's like radiation for your body.  Just knowing he's in the vicinity, it's like kryptonite.  Yeah.  Brontosaurus head peeking in.  Hi.  Brontosaurus head.  He's eating your plants.  You know he would enjoy listening.  Of course.  He's one of those guys. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, got my ear to the grindstone.  Oh, yeah.  But, uh, he's a lunatic.  Yeah, he's a psycho.  And we got to get into that someday.  Yeah, he is a creep.  Why is he like that?  What is it in his brain where he can't sleep in someone else's house or mellow out in someone's house for a couple hours?  Go back a little in his history and see what-  Something is going on.  What happened there?  Dude, there's other times.  I got the really nice apartment with the extra room.  I come downstairs.  He's a disheveled mess.  I'm like, what happened?  He's like, you know, because it's an old fact that he goes on. 
[00:15:00]  All of Jimmy's gigs.  And Jimmy's, you know, gigging all over the place.  So it was another one of these gigs where he didn't have time to go home.  And he's sleeping in his car outside my really nice apartment.  Why?  Like, it doesn't make sense.  Poor bastard.  He doesn't understand.  Like, that's what guys do.  They help each other out when they can.  Ugh.  But anyway, we'll hopefully get into that maybe a little later.  More of Ann on Red Eye.  Ooh.  Hey, Anthony, can you blame these guys for being terrified? 
[00:15:30]  The media and the politicians are paying-  I should set this up a little bit.  Oh.  You guys are talking about AIG, right?  AIG, apparently there's a memo out.  Yeah.  Where they are talking about how to handle these death threats that they're getting.  Right.  There's a whole memo that talks about don't wear apparel that has AIG on it.  Watch where you're walking.  Keep an eye on your surroundings.  Really?  Um, yeah, when you're entering and exiting the building, look for suspicious people. 
[00:16:00]  Uh, it really is, uh, amazing that they have to put this memo out for people at AIG.  That is unbelievable.  Because they're getting death threats.  They're getting legitimate death threats.  And they should.  Yeah.  Most of them, anyway.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's a few of, uh, those AIG guys doing the right thing.  Mm-hmm.  But-  Hey, Anthony, can you blame these guys for being terrified?  The media and the politicians are painting them as greedy bastards, which is kind of  wrong, because the politicians okayed their bonuses.  I think, I'm amazed by the memo in the first place, because it's, uh, I never knew the insurance 
[00:16:30]  world was full of such intrigue and danger.  It's like a memo James Bond would get.  I know.  You know, watch your apparel, don't talk to strangers, keep your gun concealed.  But you know what they would do, they did tell James Bond, don't wear any of the 007  insignia clothing.  Of course not.  Yes.  And the insurance-  It doesn't make sense.  The insurance company people don't realize we've hated them and wished them dead for  years.  This is nothing new.  But it's funny, insurance companies are basically Ponzi schemes based on you not dying. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Roll the dice, don't hit anything.  Exactly.  Because we all-  It's great, man.  Yeah, right on, man.  You sound very, uh, very comfortable with, uh, the gang over there.  Yeah, it's a, it's one of those shows, though, that you're just sitting there and kind  of fast-paced back and forth things, so you really don't have, uh, you know, you don't  have time to sit there and think about things too long.  Right.  Which is good, because the second you start thinking, you're dead.  You mean when you're sitting there on TV and all of a sudden you go, oh my God, a lot 
[00:17:30]  of people are watching this.  Yeah.  Holy shit, there's people watching, I have nothing to say.  Right.  Baton Rouge, Anthony, Baton Rouge.  Baton Rouge.  Oh, dear God, it's millions.  Oh, no.  I just realized it's millions.  Oh, I'm, I'm in trouble now.  I've stepped in it.  You have moments like that.  There was one moment during, when I did a letter with, when Bill Maher was on, and I  didn't think a joke, it actually was much better than I thought it was when I watched  it.  Right.  But I had a moment where I'm talking and Bill's next to me, and I, this is the thought 
[00:18:00]  I had, as I'm talking, I'm thinking, you're bombing on The Tonight Show.  Oh, no.  That was the thought I had.  Oh, that's not a confidence booster.  It's one of those weird things where you're like, oh my God, I'm dying.  I'm dying.  It's a night show.  Horrifying.  Oh, wow.  It's very scary.  That show moves fast.  The Greg show moves very quickly.  Yeah, yeah, very fast.  It's like tough crowd in a way, but it's, it moves actually faster.  That's why there's only one point where I had a line that I wasn't able to get 
[00:18:30]  the punchline out, so I only got the setup out.  It was where one of the other guests were talking about college basketball, which we  had talked about on this goddamn show that we know nothing about, and they made it a  subject, so we kind of goofed on that.  I joked to Greg.  I said, you're the expert at college basketball.  Make sure you bring that up.  And then we were like, you know, he knows nothing about it.  I know nothing about college basketball.  And one of the girls on the show was talking about.  Please tell me she knew a lot about it to make you guys look dumb.  She knew enough to say, like, UNC versus... 
[00:19:00]  Go Huskies, Ant.  Yeah, yeah.  The Huskies.  But she said UNC.  Go Huskies.  So I told her, I said, I go, wow, she knows UNC.  And then, like, I was cut off.  So all I said was, she knows UNC.  My joke was, she knows UNC.  All I know is if you had one more letter, it makes a fun word jumble.  And, obviously, a cunt joke, which would have been great on TV, but I wasn't able to slide  the old punch line in. 
[00:19:30]  But that's how the show goes.  It goes really fast.  You've got to kind of pick your spots.  It just sounds like you're being factual.  Yes.  I was just saying, she knows.  That's right.  UNC, bucko.  We should have a little flag with a bulldog on it.  Perfect.  I was making a cunt joke, and no one knew it.  I know, you went from, there's one letter separated, lovely compliment from worst insult  in the world.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Bobo.  Oh, no.  Bobo in the hizzy. 
[00:20:00]  What the hell are you doing here so early, man?  We don't even let people in until seven.  But I, Bobo.  What's up, Bobo?  I was in towed.  He's the only one on the bleachers so far.  And Fridays, we usually get a huge, well, all right.  You talk, Bobo.  Why not?  And it's David that's not really paying attention.  Of course not.  No, I was just going to say that Fridays, we've got a huge crowd.  You're the first to arrive there, Bobo.  What do you got going on?  Why are you here early?  Because of the time it takes to get here. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  The time it takes to get here.  Where are you coming from?  Tennessee?  No, from Maspitt.  But the bus takes a while.  Ah, the bus.  Yeah, the waiting time.  I got to take a bus to get to the nearest subway station.  The bus to the subway.  You ever find your wallet?  No, I didn't find it.  Did you get all your stuff replaced yet?  Yeah, they're sending it.  All right.  You got a wallet?  That I didn't get it yet. 
[00:21:00]  It's on order.  I saw your wallet.  He carries the big-ass wallet.  Like the massive, over-the-top.  What does it look like?  His tongue.  It is.  Obama enjoyed that one.  It's big, and it's got something on it.  It had like an insignia on it.  What was on the wallet?  No, it didn't have an insignia.  It was green.  Oh, but you're ordering one with something on it, right?  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  What is it?  It's like a Mets wallet.  Oh, a Mets wallet.  Oh, a nice little Mets wallet for the Bobo.  That's Walid.  All right.  I want my Walid.  We should get him to do something for the show today, because I don't think we're doing  David and Bobo today, Bobo.  All right, Bobo?  All right.  You're all right?  Okay, Bobo.  Bobo, you sit there, Bobo.  All right.  Okay, Bobo?  All right.  Bobo.  Hey, you know, there's a lot going on in the news.  You want Bobo to do maybe a little news cap for us?  Can we write a little something for the guy?  With commentary, of course, because Bobo, you know. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's got to editorialize.  His voice has to be heard.  Yeah, it has to be.  Yeah, it certainly does.  You know, people like, thank God, it's Bobo and not David.  So, you got that going for you.  All right, Bobo.  Thank you.  Back to Anthony on Red Eye.  Ant talks about teen girls thinking Chris Brown is okay.  That's the setup here.  Anthony, no matter what, no matter what goes on, you never hit a girl right.  You never hit a girl right.  Or can you?  You know, you never hit a girl right.  Correctly.  Yeah, that's what you're trying to say. 
[00:22:30]  Why would so many of these girls think it's okay?  Newsflash.  Teen girls are stupid.  They're morons.  Yes, they are.  I think some of these girls need to sit down with maybe a marathon of Lifetime movies.  Yes.  Markie Post in Men Suck.  And just sit down and show how the nice guy started out and then beats her and then she  kills him in the burning bed or something.  You just have me.  Now I'm just thinking about how hot Markie Post was for a good four years.  Markie Post.  She was really something else. 
[00:23:00]  Markie Post.  Who talks about Markie Post?  Fucking ugh.  Not even Mr. and Mrs. Post.  No.  Good old Markie.  They've abandoned her.  No one talks about her.  Richard Mole wouldn't talk about her.  They said, what blonde did you want to fuck in the mid-80s?  Oh, nice.  Are you going to go back on?  Yeah.  Before you try to get back on, they're like, look, we're sorry.  Yeah, we'll call.  Yeah.  No, they were very cool.  They absolutely said they would have me back. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, they're nice people, man.  Yeah.  They want you to do it.  Because Josh's producer was saying, yeah, you got Ann coming on.  He's like, how are we going to get Opi on?  So they want me on.  I'm starting to, like, you know, just disappear into the woodwork.  Disappear into the woodwork.  You're doing a high-profile radio job.  Yeah, it's kind of hard.  People are frightened by the pictures I've been tweeting lately.  Frightened.  They say, yeah, I'm doing that, the Bickle look a little too well lately.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  You really do, I think, find out people's personality by the pictures that they tweet.  Because I'm noticing Jimmy tweets food.  Yeah.  Jimmy tweets a lot of pictures of food.  Jimmy loves his fucking food.  What?  And then your shitty sign.  Oh, that awful sign at the gym.  Jim Norden scrawled out on a piece of paper.  It's horrible.  And then, yeah.  I'm doing the psycho look lately.  With Opi, you can take all his Twittered pictures and put them next to each other, back 
[00:24:30]  to back, like a book, and flip them, and I think they'll actually move like a movie.  Yes, he takes a lot of pictures.  I just like to creep people out, I guess.  Let me see something.  I got to show you the Fezzy one.  Hey.  Yeah, I want the comments, though.  That's...  Oh, my God.  That is fucking...  Psychotic, right?  Yeah, that's Chainsaw Massacre.  Yeah, but see, I'm an actor. 
[00:25:00]  I just haven't really...  What is that?  What?  That ain't you.  That's me.  That's Opi.  I'm an actor, Jimmy.  How old is that?  That was yesterday.  I'm telling you, I'm an actor that hasn't been discovered yet.  And now that I'm pushing, you know, 40.  Oh, gee, the big 4-0's coming up.  Hey, but, you know, but, you know what?  Dangerfield wasn't discovered until he was a lot older in his career, so I still got a shot.  By the way, you just...  I'm telling you, I'm an actor.  You just heard...  Opi just revealed a private conversation that he's had with himself. 
[00:25:30]  Rodney has it, like when Bob Kelly all day, like, dude, you know what?  Rodney was in his 50s, dude.  He actually was, Rodney.  Rodney was a fucking...  Rodney was actually a...  I think he was in his...  I think he was...  Mid to mid 40s.  Yeah, yeah, I think he was in the mid 40s, I do believe.  Rodney was in the game and he left.  He did aluminum siding for 10 years and then came back.  Yeah, I...  And he made it.  I truly believe that I still have a shot at doing some acting.  I'm an actor.  Can you act?  Caddyshack, totally.  Can I act?  Look at that. 
[00:26:00]  You think I walk around like that all the time?  I look like a serial killer.  You couldn't get your buckles straight?  I didn't want to.  That's the key.  See, you don't understand the craft.  The craft.  You got to look a little disheveled.  This business.  It's like your mind's not right.  We call show.  The comments.  Don't do that as far as the picture we're looking at.  It's me in a snowsuit because...  Because of you guys...  We're going to get back to the red eye thing in a second.  But now this needs a little bit of a setup.  Because of you guys, Fez had another massive breakdown on the Ryan Fez show. 
[00:26:30]  I never wanted that to happen, to tell you the truth.  Really?  I was just talking and I didn't think he'd get that upset because it's just talking about,  you know, talking about stuff they talked about on the show.  I would never reveal anything that has not been on their show.  Right.  But for some reason...  Well, not for some reason.  I don't know.  I don't want to upset Fez anymore.  And then Ronnie's like, well, I think Opie is at least on your side.  Oh!  And then Fezzy said something like, no, he's just being sarcastic. 
[00:27:00]  Whatever, I can't really do the Fezzy.  I think he's just being sarcastic.  So I wrote something like, no, Fez, I love you.  You know, let's have a sleepover or something, right?  Yeah.  No, I wrote, let's have a sleepover, but we have to wear snowsuits.  That's the rule.  And then Fezzy, you know, Ronnie read that from my Twitter.  And then Fezzy's like, I don't have a snowsuit, and I bet you he doesn't have one either. 
[00:27:30]  So then I took the picture to prove I do have a snowsuit.  That is a snowsuit and some gloves.  And gloves.  And I'm willing to do a sleepover with Fezzy as long as he wears his snowsuit at my apartment.  A snowsuit sleepover.  But you're only saying that because you didn't want to see him without clothing.  Clothing because...  Clothing.  Clothing because of, you know...  Well, I don't know what's going on in that mind.  Let's be honest.  Well, you're saying basically that without the snowsuit, he's just fatty pneumonia to you.  Oh, don't even start that.  There's no reason to say that about Fezzy. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, no.  And then, uh...  He's a good boy.  I just like the song.  The meaning of it, I feel very bad about.  Yeah.  The song is kind of fun.  But to prove that, I'm an actor with this picture that you can see on OP Radio, by the  way.  But this one that writes, that's scary, Ope.  You look like a combination of Sling Blade and a retarded Forrest Gump.  Oh, yeah.  You kind of look like a trailer.  Trash Mario.  That's a compliment if you look like it.  You look like a compliment between...  But it's bad if you write a paper and they say, well, this reads like a combination of 
[00:28:30]  Sling Blade.  Right, right, right.  Well...  This guy says, you kind of look like a trailer, trash, Mario Brothers, I think.  Oh, yeah.  See that?  Evil Mario.  Let's hope Fez doesn't have a Luigi fetish.  Or maybe...  That's the point.  Game on.  This one just says, I work down at Bill Cox's outfit.  Bill Cox's outfit.  Fixing lawnmowers and whatnot.  Whatnot.  That's all you do.  It is hard candy.  Hey, dummy, we need another whatnot fixed, you idiot. 
[00:29:00]  Someone wrote on Instant Feedback.  Ope, I swear I thought your picture was a G.I.  Joe figure.  They didn't...  Oh, yeah.  It does look like an action figure.  Someone said it was a Ken doll dressed up.  No, man, that's me acting, because I'm an actor.  You know, you could Photoshop your face to look like plastic.  That would be kind of cool.  Really?  Someone work on it.  Well, I had the really heavy gloves on, too, and they're awkwardly in front of me.  Yeah.  See, Jimmy, I know what to do with my hands. 
[00:29:30]  Look how creepy I make myself look just by using my hands.  Joe knows.  The hands are out.  But what you don't see is when the film is rolling out.  Now what do you do?  You just kind of put them by your side?  Yeah, for a still picture, it's easy.  You think when they're out, like, ah!  And then when the camera's rolling, you put them down.  All right.  Not so much erg.  I'm coming for you.  Hands in pockets.  Speedmetal writes, Opie, take off the snow pants, gloves, and hat, and call for help.  You look like a Ken doll.  This guy says, you look like a fucking psychopath. 
[00:30:00]  You've lost it.  You've finally gone around the bend.  Can't say I'm too surprised.  You look like Dexter if he had to murder someone in the snow.  Kevin from Connecticut is calling you Elmer Dud.  Why don't you take a private acting lesson?  Huh?  Try it.  Why don't you do that?  How do you know I'm not doing some acting lessons?  Because I'm an actor.  If you're not, why don't you try it?  It's, uh...  You never know, man.  You're sucking... 
[00:30:30]  Dude, I don't need acting lessons.  I'm a natural.  No.  It said a prodigy?  I really am.  Name some of those natural actors that never took acting lessons, because I'm in that category.  Uh...  Jerry Seinfeld?  Oh.  I knew that was...  What did he say?  I didn't even hear.  Can I tell him?  Did you say...  Don't put me in the Jerry Seinfeld category.  I'm a better...  I'm a better actor than Jerry Seinfeld.  Let's be honest.  He wasn't the best actor as far as the Seinfeld. 
[00:31:00]  No, he was laughing his way through the entire show.  It's not about me.  Let's get back to Anthony on Red Eye.  Ah, Red Eye.  Ant talks about Obama's suicide bomb metaphor.  Yes, yes.  Do you actually have the clip of Obama on there?  I hope so.  I don't know.  It kind of sets it up.  Here's the problem.  Yeah, okay.  We do have it.  Yeah, Obama was talking about the banks and everything like that, and he tried to make  a metaphor of AIG and these banks and a suicide bomber, and it just fails miserably. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Here's the problem.  It's almost like they've got a bomb strapped to them, and they've got their hand on the trigger.  You don't want them to blow up, but you've got to kind of talk them, ease that finger  off the trigger.  Wow.  Yeah.  He just fell apart.  They've got to stay away from those lines. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Those funny lines.  Someone wrote that for him and goes, look, this will be really good.  I don't think anyone wrote that for him.  Oh, you don't even think?  You just went with it?  No, that's what we talked about.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Let me shut the fuck up.  No, it's cool.  It's just, but you could tell.  I mean, it's so, he's trying to put it together.  Can I tell you, Colin pointed this out, too, like, as far as Obama being like a black man,  he seemed like the hip guy compared to McCain, but he's a fucking nerd.  He really is. 
[00:32:30]  The man is a nerd.  He's Urkel.  He's not a cool guy.  He's just like, in that world, he's a cool guy, but he is.  Urkel.  What's wrong with the nerds we got?  He is a fucking dork.  They keep pretty good.  Well, you're right.  He looks like he should be really cool, and he's just not.  No.  He's just not.  Remember when he had to imitate The Rock?  Because everyone's like, oh my god, he's The Rock.  Oh my god, that's the...  And he failed miserably. 
[00:33:00]  The Rock says...  The Rock says...  Does he?  He's a dork.  Yeah, he is.  He's really a nerd.  Bush was a funnier guy.  Not that that means anything, but Bush was an underrated, funny dude.  He was a fucking...  Shooting loads on bitches.  That's hysterical.  He was.  The White House.  He was a funny guy, George Bush.  He really was.  George Bush.  As far as his...  Bill Clinton or George Bush?  No, George Bush was a funny guy.  Oh, George Bush.  Like, I mean, like, when he shit on himself, like, you know, when he would speak, and I  don't mean when he was being dumb, but like, when he would actually say something that was 
[00:33:30]  meant to be funny.  Yeah.  George Bush was a funny guy.  He could come up with a line at the old podium.  Yeah, and he had great fucking delivery.  He had great fucking...  Did he have good timing, Jimmy?  He really did.  I mean, for a president that was committing, you know, really big mistakes.  I mean, God bless his timing.  At least he got some laughs.  Fucking, like, when he says, there's the haves and the haves-moors.  And the haves-moors.  And the haves-moors, whatever.  Haves-moors.  Well, let's see what Anna has to say about this Obama cup. 
[00:34:00]  The s'mores are delicious.  We just played for everybody.  Afterward, he made cocoa for everyone.  Seriously, is he great or what?  Hey, Anthony, is this really the right metaphor to be using?  First of all, him going off teleprompter is horrible.  And I believe if you release the button, that's when the bomb goes off.  Yes.  So he should have done a little more research.  Excellent point.  The analogy is a little extreme for what happened.  I mean, it is horrible.  But I think it's more like, if you want to use any kind of explosive,  it's like your drunk friend looking in the mortar tube on the 4th of July 
[00:34:30]  and getting his face blown off.  That is true.  It's a little more accurate.  There's an explosion.  There's an idiot to look at.  That's a little like last night for Greg.  Yes.  It wasn't a firework.  It wasn't a mortar either.  It was a house plate.  There were fireworks, though.  Nice.  Anthony stuck a low joke in there.  I certainly did.  It wasn't a mortar either.  Isn't it great what you can actually say sometimes?  I know.  You just said the host got cum on his face.  Yes.  A big cock shot cum in his face. 
[00:35:00]  That's right.  Thank you for having me.  That's right.  Yeah.  I see that in the news.  Ant accuses Fox hosts of being a lucky double.  Take that, TV host.  And finally, Ant talks about Obama focusing on the final four.  Yes.  Yes.  I don't know what you said because I had to go to Sleepy, but I don't have a problem with  Obama going on Leno and joking.  We're going to get into that because he had a little slip up.  They didn't grab my other line either, did they?  Which one?  Because I kind of tagged the whole thing when we were talking about the teen girls saying 
[00:35:30]  how they were saying that, what's her name?  Was that fault for getting beat up?  Oh, Rihanna.  Yeah, Rihanna.  It was her fault.  They pulled a bunch of teen girls and I said they were stupid.  And then later on, of course, I got in the jab of they're stupid, but it makes it that  much easier to get them into the trunk of your car.  Perfect.  It's another, you know, teen abduction and rape joke.  So who cut this up?  They figured that wasn't good enough for our radio show. 
[00:36:00]  Genius!  Oh, Sam.  Sam's jealous.  I guess Sam was...  My time to shine.  I guess Sam was critical of your...  Yeah.  He just didn't think that joke would cut the mustard?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  We might have to ask Sam why he didn't pull that particular clip for Anthony.  It's like Shelly Long with Rupert Pupkin.  We listened to your tape with great interest.  And you need a little work.  With great interest.  Did you?  It's time to watch that movie again. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, you got to.  Sam, why didn't you pull the big Rihanna joke?  Nice little abduction, rape slash whatever joke.  Stupid teen girls.  And then later on, you could have actually moved it to the end of that one.  Done a little editing.  Well, I wanted to keep it...  Why would that be on?  What?  There you go.  I wanted to keep it in its crystal clear form.  I didn't want to edit because I didn't want anybody to think that your humor was being  manipulated in the post.  Oh, in its pristine state.  Right.  It's got an answer for everything.  And then I figured that joke was good on TV, but it was short form. 
[00:37:00]  And I thought, I don't know if the setup will be there.  If I give the audio clip, maybe I should give him the opportunity to just do it again live.  What a douchebag.  Thank you.  You got your answer, though.  I certainly did.  And he does have an answer for everything.  It was a good joke.  He's Sam.  Tool time, Sam.  Are they going to finally arrest this guy for killing his buddies?  He didn't kill them.  They slipped off and just felt like, nah.  Yeah.  Talking about the boating thing.  The NFL guys. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  That guy is sitting up there nice.  Something went on.  Playing king of the hill on that motor.  Yeah.  I'm not giving up on my theory on that one.  I think you'll find a few boot marks in some people's faces if you found them.  It was every man for themselves.  One spot would mean the survival.  Yes.  And that guy was the winner.  Why aren't they looking into that?  Why?  Finally, Anne talks about Obama focusing on the final four.  Anthony, does Shevsky have a point?  Is Obama focusing too much on the brackets? 
[00:38:00]  Coach has a great point here.  It's economics.  He should be focusing on, not that.  I think he should pay attention to perhaps the final four banks that will be in existence  at the end of the month.  Instead of my money, Bank of America.  I think that's a good bet.  I think they're going to take on Citi Corp and kick a little ass.  I love it.  Bill, you're all being very hard on Coach Shyamalan and Ding Dong right now.  Really?  That's not his name, Bill.  We are such college basketball fans.  Boy, are we knowledgeable on the other subject. 
[00:38:30]  We were talking about this this morning on your show.  We're grown men.  We have no knowledge of what's going on.  I told you that.  This is like going on Jeopardy with the category you have no idea about.  Thanks.  Very good, man.  It was great, man.  Yeah, you guys are rocking.  It was fun.  Yeah, definitely.  Love to do that again.  Bravo, bravo.  Yeah.  All right.  I actually woke up at...  It was odd.  I was sleeping because it's three in the fucking morning and I woke up about halfway through  it and it was on and I'm like, oh.  I opened an eye, kind of caught half of it. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, you're like, oh, I did that.  I went back to sleep.  Oh, cool.  That's me.  I remember doing that.  Oh, nice.  I was just doing that and now I'm sleeping.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So weird, right?  It really is.  It's an odd thing.  It's really stupid.  Like Jimmy said, you just go in a room.  Yeah.  There's these rooms all over the place that you can then just broadcast from.  There's a coffee.  You have coffee and there's little snacks.  They have little finger food.  Yeah.  And they go, all right, it's time.  And you go, time for what?  Time for what?  Time for what?  Time for what?  To be on TV?  To be on the television set? 
[00:39:30]  I like the dressing room.  I like the lead up.  Yeah.  I want to actually do it.  I hate the lead up.  Because the dressing room is like the womb.  You're all safe in there.  You got finger food.  I hate the lead up.  I love the being on it and when it's over.  I like when it's over.  When it's over, it's good.  Being on it is...  I like that too.  I don't...  The only time I'm a wreck is eight to ten hours beforehand.  I'm just like... 
[00:40:00]  You think.  It's like, oh, I got to do that.  And you get that in your stomach.  But then once you get on, it's just like, oh, okay, cool.  That one is not as nerve-wracking anymore because, again, I know Greg and Bill's great and Andy Levy.  It's like they're nice guys and everyone has jokes bomb and do great, so it doesn't matter.  There's no pressure.  It's like if a joke bops, no one gives a fuck.  It's like they're cool people.  And then you try to think about it like this.  Like we come in here on a daily basis.  Yes, we do!  And we broadcast.  You know?  We broadcast. 
[00:40:30]  But I don't think about it like we're broadcasting.  I just think we're coming in and doing what we're doing.  I think that's been obvious to people.  No one here looks at it like it's being broadcast.  That's probably our number one problem.  But there's no, you know, I don't pull up in the truck and go like, oh, my God, we're doing radio.  But if I was doing someone else's show, I'd be all like nervous.  Someone else's radio show.  No.  Yes.  Radio-wise?  Yes. 
[00:41:00]  I still get like butterflies when I call in to Ron and Fez.  When I'm sitting in on the show, it's cool.  But when I'm calling and I'm waiting on hold, I'm like, oh, I'm going to hear that.  Ah, hello.  I'm like, ah!  Calling into radio shows suck.  Very hard.  For these people that call our show, God bless you.  Because, you know, you call into Ron and Fez and you're thinking, is Ronnie just rolling his eyes?  And like, oh, my God.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Am I on too long?  These guys.  Are they just being charitable? 
[00:41:30]  What's he want?  What's he want?  Yeah, what's he want?  We're in the middle of Fezzy crying and Ant decided to call in.  We've got to cater to the stars of 202.  And you know he's just rolling his eyes.  Can I tell you who I'm in awe of?  I mean, on the phone.  Oh, Jimmy.  You is obvious.  You is the obvious one.  That goes without saying.  That's like saying, what do I like?  Air.  Of course.  All right.  I'm just bummed that you're in awe of someone else besides me.  Jay Moore.  And I didn't hear the phone call during the St. Paddy's Day.  That you guys were doing?  Yeah.  But the fact that that motherfucker can call in and kill during a live event. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Dude, that guy is one of the greatest fucking radio phone callers ever.  It's really a hard thing to do.  He's very comfortable.  God damn it, she fucking grabbed him for it.  We missed the Jay Moore.  And I hear he's still in town.  Maybe he stops by today and says, hey, hello, boy.  Yeah, I'd love to see Jay, man.  I don't think it's going to happen.  I'm not going to tease something that most likely isn't happening.  I heard Patrice was amazed by his calling.  Again, Kenny was only telling me the details.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He turned Patrice.  I think Patrice didn't realize that Jay Moores is an impressionist. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  He didn't realize how good of an impressionist Jay Moores is.  And Jay has taken on everybody as far as that goes now.  He should.  He should be taking on everyone.  He's declared war on what?  Frank Caliendo, right?  Oh, yeah.  He did.  And I want to get Dean Edwards on because he does a great Tracy Morgan.  We were trying to set that up because Jay Moores, Tracy Morgan, was good, too.  Dean Edwards does a really fucking great Tracy.  And Dean does a great Chris Rock.  Denzel Washington, I heard him do. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, yeah, he does.  Dean's a fucking really good impressionist.  Dean was on 30 Rock last night?  Denzel's hard.  Motherfucker.  And I think we said no to Dean because I had...  He was on once.  Was he?  Yeah, a long time ago.  He was years ago.  2004.  Was he good?  Yeah, he rocks like the, I don't know, the fat guy.  Was it that long ago he was on?  All right, we've got to get him back on.  He was underused on SNL.  Dean's a very, very talented impressionist.  He was underused on SNL.  Next time he rolls through New York, we'll get him on.  He lives here, so anytime you guys want him, he'll come on. 
[00:43:30]  Let's get him on next week.  Yeah.  You have his number?  Because we were trying to hunt his phone numbers down.  I can get it.  Why are we doing this?  No one gives a shit.  This is like a show meeting.  This is what we do after the show.  That's all right.  Ron and Fez do.  Yeah.  Good point.  Show meetings.  But we were talking about him and Jay and stuff like that, and I think it'd be interesting  to see who does that.  It's Tracy and Dean.  That's what I want to do.  Tracy didn't want Dean doing Tracy, and he talked about that, because he did him so well.  Right.  He's like the first one doing Tracy, too, unless Jay did him earlier.  You've got to hear his Denzel.  Yeah, yeah, it's great.  It's like, what are you doing? 
[00:44:00]  Who does Denzel Washington?  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  Jimmy, you got something you want to talk about after the break?  Yeah, I want to mention the fact that I don't normally drive very quickly.  I'm not a speeder.  You, as a matter of fact, have persecuted me.  I have chastised you.  For my speeding.  Selfishly, of course, because, you know, my mortgage relies on everybody in the room  being healthy.  Of course.  Let me correct that.  My mortgage relies on you, too, being healthy.  Danny, I love you, but if you fell through a fucking glass, a box of glasses, it wouldn't 
[00:44:30]  bother me.  I couldn't think of a funnier thing to happen to Danny.  Which means you secretly love him.  I do like Danny, very much.  You couldn't figure out a good deal for him.  With a box of glasses.  What kind of glasses, improv master?  The kind you wear, Dan.  We all know those are dangerous.  I think I'd still make it to work the next day.  Not only would you make it to work, all you'd be doing is wiping glass off you.  I'd go, what happened?  You got fell into a box of glasses.  Fell into some spectacles.  Yes.  You could have fell into a bucket of shit and said, Jim, that was your joke, but in a 
[00:45:00]  bucket.  Get it?  Oof.  No, I was playing.  Not so easy.  So, yeah.  Ooh, boy.  Oh, wow.  Sometimes when you're teasing something, I'm a tuckered out boy.  Pass the ball back to me, please.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Pass pass.  Thanks.  Lateral.  Jim, you threw the ball into the fence.  I pulled a martini.  Yes, you did.  Jimmy, after the break, Jimmy's going to talk about him going vroom, vroom. 
[00:45:30]  I've never.  And what happened when he went vroom, vroom.  I've never driven over 100 miles an hour before.  Ever.  We'll see what he topped out at after the break.  Oh, a little challenge.  That's right.  And Obama's Special Olympics joke.  Everybody's going to be talking about this today.  Everybody.  It's too early now.  That's right.  I'm outraged.  But, I mean, it's going to be all over the TV.  And, of course, he was on Leno last night.  We got some of those clips.  So, we got lots to do today.  I'm going to go tweet Bobo's stupid face.  You guys listen to this, and we'll be back. 
[00:46:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Yo, listen.  This is Tracy Morgan.  I want you to know one thing.  When I'm sitting at home or in my car and I got the fly jaguar put on that XM radio,  there's nothing better than listening to my boys, Opie and Anthony.  They keep it gutter.  Gully for the streets, you heard?  They're hilarious.  That's a new word.  That's bananas and hilarious mix.  The Belarious.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Hey, we got that.  Sam loving this, right?  What is this?  Zombie?  Zombie.  Is it Rob or White?  Thumbs up.  Rob or White?  This is Rob.  All right.  Living Dead Girl.  Oh, this is Living Dead Girl?  Yeah.  Nice.  When this song first came out, I just played it all the time.  It's a great zombie song.  He's got a little of that talent in him.  Yeah.  A little talent.  I like the Rob Zombie. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, Vinnie Brand's coming in in about a half hour.  Very cool.  Oh, thank God.  Wow.  You see, the big stars just, this is like a gateway for them.  They just come right through.  And Lisa Sparks actually is coming today.  Really?  And she'll also do our show.  Oh, good gosh.  Because she's a porn star.  That's double entendre.  I know.  It's crazy.  Double entendre.  I'm an actor.  Don't say actor.  That's stupid. 
[00:47:30]  I'm an actor.  I think thespian is a good word.  Not yet.  No, just an actor.  I haven't done Shakespeare yet.  I have to do Shakespeare to be a thespian.  Hey, look who's on TV.  Oh, look at that.  She's in front of a green screen and a ranger screen.  She's playing hockey.  That's wonderful.  That's good.  Going to have to bring the Zamboni out.  Oh, my God.  Going to look like somebody got a skate to the throat in a second.  Leave it alone.  I know.  I really should.  But that is terrible. 
[00:48:00]  Leave it alone.  Funny, though, man.  Anyway, Jimmy.  We lost Jimmy.  I don't know what's going on.  It's fine.  Whatever.  Oh, here he is.  He probably had to make wee-wees.  Yeah, do the wee of the wee.  Hey, are we doing our meat party this weekend?  Meat party.  I hope so.  We're setting up a meat party.  Nothing but meat.  Meat.  The Opie and Anthony meat party.  That doesn't sound good.  No kidding.  We're talking about the Brazilian steakhouse that we all were discussing yesterday. 
[00:48:30]  You know where I went?  Would you do a meat party?  Well, no, not really.  No?  Last night, as a matter of fact, after Red Eye, I went to a place called, I believe it's  called, what, Captain Jack's, was it?  It's right across from the place we used to work.  Yeah, on the other side, on the 56th Street side.  I don't know where that was.  What kind of place?  I've never heard of it.  A steakhouse.  What are you talking about? 
[00:49:00]  It's wonderful.  56th between 8th and 7th or something?  You mean K-Rock?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or N-E-W.  I don't acknowledge we ever worked for K-Rock at this point.  Really?  Yeah.  Remember that place?  Yeah.  No, I don't really.  We used to spend some time there and then leave at 9?  That was some weird time travel.  Yeah.  Now we're back to, we used to work at N-E-W.  We were fired and we've been doing the satellite radio thing.  Across from Nobu 57, you mean?  Yeah, it's on the other side of the filthy street.  I was going to go to Beacon, but they were closed.  You like that Beacon.  What happened?  You went to a steakhouse? 
[00:49:30]  You went to Captain Jack?  No, you're talking about Uncle Jack's.  Or Captain Jack's.  Uncle Jack's.  You didn't like Uncle Jack's?  I used to work for the guy's brother.  Oh, oh really?  Does he jerk off on the meat?  The guy, uh.  Oh no.  What?  Oh, Danny.  Danny.  Did you ruin my experience?  That family sucks my dick.  Oh, Danny.  Well, it sounds like personal problems, but I'll tell you.  What is that the truth?  It was a good steak.  I hope you choke on it. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, Danny.  Whole family lined up to toot on Danny's delicious cock and balls.  He actually likes them.  He wasn't insulting them.  The family sucks my dick.  I see them every holiday.  Oh, Danny.  Wow.  Anyway, you went to Captain or Uncle Jack's?  Uncle Jack's.  All right.  I was thinking of the Billy Joel song.  This is all getting cut from the replay.  Oh no.  No, no.  That's fine.  Allegedly, Danny had a little problem with that family.  I had to pick the one restaurant that Danny had a problem in.  Yes.  Great.  But how was the steak, despite the obvious family issues with certain people? 
[00:50:30]  Well, now I don't know what was going on in the back there.  Perhaps Danny could enlighten us.  What, did they not pay you or something?  No, they were just a bunch of scum bags.  Oh, okay.  Well, yeah.  Okay, then I won't plug them.  You know you work for a bad place when they offer to pay you in cocaine.  Just want to throw that out there.  Depends on the year.  No, I used to DJ up in Geneseo.  Yeah.  And they would offer everybody either pay or coke. 
[00:51:00]  That's fantastic.  No, it isn't.  It was back then.  I had to eat, motherfucker.  Not if you were doing coke.  You weren't eating or getting a boner.  Unbelievable, though.  Yeah.  You'd go up into the, kind of like the attic slash office.  They'd sit you down and go, all right, we owe you this.  You want it in money or coke?  Swear to God.  The place is no longer in business, so.  I would gather, yeah.  No.  And then that same person kind of locked the doors one day, and that was it.  Skipped town, owing a lot of money to a lot of people. 
[00:51:30]  That's odd.  That never happens.  And rumor has it he got a few beatings in the years to come.  We'll usually come with paying people in cocaine.  Yeah.  But anyway, Uncle Jack's.  Yeah.  No, no, I'm not going to.  I won't, you know, plug.  So how was UJ's?  No, I'm Danny.  I'm not going to.  I was fine.  It's forever ago.  No.  Is it the same guy?  Well, I worked for his brother.  His brother owned a place that I used to bartend for, but the guy that owns Jack's, he would 
[00:52:00]  come in a lot.  So I knew the both of them.  What did they do to you?  Well, they're just typical.  They're just all, you know, they're typical bar owners.  I mean, if you ever work for a guy who owns, you know, just a bunch of fucking cocks.  Sure.  I worked at Chicago Pizza Pub in Huntington over there.  What year?  Oh, my God.  It had to be.  Please tell me you served me once.  Because that was my joint in high school.  Served?  What do you think?  I was a waiter?  I was a fucking scrub dishwasher in the back. 
[00:52:30]  Did you spit on my pizza?  No, no.  I never spit on the pizza.  Not the pizza.  And then he threw his apron at the guy to go fucking deliver $5,000 for the cocaine.  There's a lot of dishes here, Anthony.  Yeah, I worked there.  And the boss there, Elliot, was just a scumbag.  So, you know, I think it's just the way they are.  But when you go in there to eat, they try to treat you nice.  I think nicer than the employees, let's say, I guess. 
[00:53:00]  Really?  They don't, you know, kick you around.  Hey, you finished eating?  Get in the back and serve that table.  Wow.  No, I just went there and had a, I just had a really nice dinner there.  And now you feel weird.  Now I feel weird because, you know, it was bad to Danny and stuff, so.  Well, it's just funny because, like, if you own a bar, you should kind of know that, you  know, that bartenders get tipped and stuff.  So, you know, maybe if you come into your brother's place and, you know, you're getting  taken care of because I know who you are, maybe you should throw me more than, like, 
[00:53:30]  a $3 tip.  Oh, damn.  I'll never, I'll never forget him.  He used to come in, not so much, but he would come in, like, on a regular basis.  Yeah.  If I see his steakhouse in a store, I will make sure to, like, put the labels the other  way.  Like, to this day.  Wow.  And I worked for this guy.  It had to be, like, it was, like, eight years ago.  You guys were still on any W.  Holy shit, you hold a grudge.  Jesus.  That's that entitlement. 
[00:54:00]  Dude, and you know what?  These guys are like, it was just, I just happened to be driving past that bar that I used to  work at, and I, for a split second, saw a pizzeria sign, and I got so excited that the  place turned into a pizzeria.  Yeah.  And then on the way back, I saw that I was just, I was just a little ahead of myself on  the block, and the place was still there, and I got all bummed out about it.  I was like, yeah, it went out of business.  Oh, no, no, it did.  Oh, damn.  That is a good feel when you see that stuff going on.  And a little insult to injury now, because you say the guy tipped- 
[00:54:30]  Well, and now you just put money in his brother's pocket.  I, I, well, well, the, and the bill was, I think, 350 bucks, and, and I, I threw the  way to 100, because it was such good service.  Wow.  The irony involved is just-  The service was fantastic.  What'd you have?  I swear.  I started out with a, uh, an assortment of seafood appetizers.  Sounds terrible!  The crab, the crab meat, and crab cakes, and lobster, and all kinds of great seafood with 
[00:55:00]  cocktail sauce.  It was fantastic.  I love cocktail sauce.  A little horseradish in it.  Oh, yeah.  Spicy.  A lemon.  Oh, and then had the Kobe steaks, uh, with some nice fresh asparagus on the side.  Oh, your piss must be drinkable.  And then, oh my God, it smells great this morning.  And then for dessert, and I was, I was full, but I had to have the dessert, that chocolate  souffle, uh, with ice cream on the side, and, uh, a little espresso with zambuca in there, 
[00:55:30]  and then a nice bottle of, uh, Shiraz, uh, for the drive home.  You're a fucking animal.  It was great.  You're an animal.  Uh, it's a healthy eater.  That's actually fucking crazy for you.  Uh, it was, it was crazy.  I, every so often, I just have to-  Gotta celebrate a little bit.  Have the big steak like that.  Uh, Natasha Richardson, blunt head trauma.  Yeah.  So she hit her head really good on that ski club, no matter what they're saying. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  That's, uh, that's what they're saying, uh, caused her death.  Yeah, people are like, oh, she barely hit her head.  Yeah, then people started thinking, blood clot, aneurysm, all this other crap, but now they're  saying, nope, blunt head trauma.  So she hit her head good.  When spring comes to just find an anvil under the snow, right?  Damn it, she fell.  Yeah.  It was a dented.  A hipping dented.  A dented an anvil.  Exactly.  If you really bang your head on it, I guess.  Oh man, you gotta crack your head. 
[00:56:30]  Jimmy, what happened?  So we, uh, we leave you yesterday.  You and Kenny rush, uh, all the way up to Albany and back.  That's, that's, that's a crazy road trip.  Yes, it was a cancer, American Cancer Society benefit.  Very good.  And, um, I was, uh, you know, I don't get a chance to drive my BMW X6 fucking V8 very  far.  Oh, beautiful car, Jimmy.  I love driving.  I do too.  That's what I hate about living in this stupid city.  The only thing I don't like is on the steering wheel, there's these paddles that you can shift  gears with. 
[00:57:00]  Paddle shifters, oh my God.  I don't want them though, because I put my hand there when I drive, so I'm gonna see if  I can have them taken off.  What's a paddle?  I really don't know.  Oh, when you, when you're manual shifting, instead of a four on the floor kind of thing,  you know, rig, it's on the, it's on the steering wheel.  So you can upshift with your, uh, right hand and get downshift with your left hand.  I miss driving.  And then you click them both in and you're in neutral.  I miss driving a stick too.  I try to get a stick.  The Ferraris and stuff have those and you scream. 
[00:57:30]  Do you like that better than actually stick shifting?  You know what I'm saying?  I love stick shifting.  I like them both for different reasons.  I like a paddle shifter because you can, in between shifting, you don't even feel a  delay.  You're just plastering the seat.  I don't want a paddle shifter in a fucking piece of shit, you know, big, something that  isn't meant for speed.  Uh, uh, but, but paddle shifter and like the Ferraris and stuff like that, it's insanity.  But something like my Mustang, I love the clutch and the, uh, six on the floor. 
[00:58:00]  Uh, that's fun.  Yeah.  They thought I was stupid.  A little more skill.  My last SUV, I'm like, could you, uh, put a stick shift in this?  They're like, they're looking at me like, yeah, we do it, but no one does it, but no  one really does it.  And I had to give up city driving.  It just stinks.  I would, I would, I, my, most of my cars, I had a stick shift.  I just, it made driving a little more entertaining.  You go through clutches like crazy in the city though.  I understand all that. 
[00:58:30]  I'm in between first and second gear.  Where do I go?  Where do I go?  First.  All right, I'll go second.  That's driving in the city.  It's sogs.  Yeah.  But back to Jimmy.  So you were going to take those paddles off.  So I was driving and, uh, I, I was riding and all of a sudden I'm like, holy mackerel,  I'm at 90 miles an hour.  90.  And I mean, smooth as silk, just zipping along.  So I said, let me hear it.  Thruway?  Yes.  Thruway North.  Yep. 
[00:59:00]  And it wasn't that, it was faster than traffic, but there was so much, there was, I felt comfortable.  I could see the cars way up in front of me.  So I got it up to 103.  I've never driven a hundred miles an hour.  103 for Jimmy is, is doing 800 miles an hour.  No offense to Jimmy, but you look at Anthony, 103, 105.  Like, eh, you look at Jimmy, 103, 105, and you openly have to laugh.  Yeah.  It's crazy for Jimmy.  That's just not you.  It's crazy for Jimmy.  I don't do that, but it was fun.  And I said, Kenny, I want to do that again. 
[00:59:30]  I was doing it again.  I said, do you dare me?  And he didn't say anything.  So I gunned it and I hit 105.  Jesus.  But thank God I hit the brakes as I saw the fucking state trooper.  Oh no.  Sitting and watching me.  Oh.  And then I was, uh, continuing on and I'm like, okay, I don't think he's going to come  out.  This is hard.  I thought you were going to go for Sammy.  What music is this?  I swear I thought you were going to go Sammy.  What is this? 
[01:00:00]  It's just some awesome chase music that Derek found one day.  It's the best.  This is time fast music.  I know.  From my chips.  I was just going to say, John and Ponch followed me.  This is what Derek hears in his head all day long.  Ponch took his unclipped cock.  Weirdo.  That's right.  And I got out of my ticket for the good suckling up the night into your mouth and then gave  you some swampland in Florida to buy and still ticketed me for being a Mary.  So I fucking, uh, I had that moment after I'm looking at the rearview mirror and he hadn't  popped out.  It was like a, uh, Oh my God. 
[01:00:30]  Are you all right?  I am.  So I, uh, I was like, oh, he's not coming out.  And then you pass him at 103 and 105 and he's not coming out.  I looked and I saw him coming out and I'm like, Oh, I know what I'll do.  I'll, I'll go into the right lane.  Cause he won't notice me in my BMW X six.  I'll hide.  Yes.  I'm hiding.  Try that move though.  Yeah.  It only works as Smokey and the bandit.  Save us your mother's womb, darling. 
[01:01:00]  Uh, that's the only time that works.  So I'm trying to hide.  And, uh, and, uh, and all of a sudden he starts zipping up and I'm like, well, he's  not coming into our lane.  And then, uh, yeah, he came right in our lane and boy.  Well, this is Sheriff Buford T justice and I'm tail grabbing your ass right now.  Well, Sheriff, were we speeding?  You look a lot dumber on the radio. 
[01:01:30]  Smokey and the retard.  Smokey and the retard.  I got pulled over.  Oh no.  And, uh, he looked like the guy for Smokey.  I don't care if you're Brad McRawford.  He comes up to Kenny's side and he has a, uh, he's a short guy.  Yeah.  Uh, I get my license and, and, uh, Reggie out, his dad would say, and he comes over and thank 
[01:02:00]  God, Kenny talked to him.  And Kenny goes, he was speeding a little, huh?  That is the best thing.  He was speeding a little, huh?  And the guy goes, but the guy wasn't a dick.  He was a New York state trooper.  And he goes, yeah, I got him up in the nineties.  So I guess I had slowed down a bit before I saw him in the nineties.  Yeah.  And I heard that.  I was like, and I wanted to go.  Oh, I was up to one Oh five.  I swear to God.  Don't you think that?  That's what I say.  It's like, you know, he goes, uh, cause I got pulled over and the cop was like, you know,  you passed me at about 90 miles an hour. 
[01:02:30]  And I'm like, I was doing at least 110, 90, 90.  What am I?  Fag 90.  I drive 90 with the, with, with, with people's fucking kids in the car.  Yeah.  So I handed over my information and he took it.  And Kenny's like, uh, Kenny's talking about me.  Like I'm his 15 year old son.  He goes, he just got the thing.  He's taking, he's trying it out.  I'm 40.  I'm very proud of my boy.  Right.  And then the Kenny goes, uh, I'm a retired police officer. 
[01:03:00]  Do you think?  And, uh, guy goes, well, do you have any ID?  So Kenny shows the ID.  And the guy was really fucking cool, man.  He was such a non dick.  He's like, uh, all right, man, just take it easy.  He didn't make no lecture.  And he didn't even check my stuff.  He just handed it right back.  Um, did you turn to, uh, Kenny before he, uh, cop got there and goes, don't worry, I'll  handle this man.  Yeah.  I thought we could take care of it right here in Brainerd.  Well, as the cop was walking back to his car, I gunned it and shot gravel on the back  of his state trooper hat and fucking amscrayed. 
[01:03:30]  But I was fucking, I was fucking Kenny cautious and I'm driving the next time we saw him a few  miles down the road and I was doing 68 in a 65 zone and I'm like, I'll bet you he's  so proud right now.  He just saw me fucking cruise control zip on by three miles over the limit.  Heedly, dude, look at me.  Just a good boy obeying all limits.  And how slow does 65 seem when you were doing a hundred?  It's like, it's like shitting on your stomach in 10 degree weather. 
[01:04:00]  How fast the log comes out with a dick pushing it back in.  There is your cruise control.  Jimmy now.  I really am.  I'm fucking, I'm a safe driver.  There is definitely a, a room in this country for an Autobahn type roadway.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Maybe not in the big cities.  I understand.  It's not going to happen on Long Island or New York or anything like that.  New York City.  The thruway is fine.  But, but you know, uh, the, the Midwest places like that, the cars nowadays are made to go a 
[01:04:30]  hundred miles an hour safely.  Mm-hmm.  You know, you just, it, it's astounding how slow 55 miles an hour is.  That X6 boogies.  Yeah, huh?  And I'm not, again, I didn't even want the V8.  I wanted the V6, but the one they had at the place I went in Jersey.  You gotta go with the V8.  I, you know, he had, so I took it.  Did you get the true code?  I, uh, I did, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  He talked to the manager.  That motherfucker mood.  I could have done 130 without batting it on.  Yeah.  Exhilarating, though.  A little bit, right?  Yeah.  You got, you, you like that?  I looked down and I said, I can't believe it.  I'm coming.  And he went, oh, oh, oh.  You know what it is, too?  It's like, when, when, when you're, when you're striving and doing the speed limit, you're,  you're talking to, you know, Kenny's in the car, so you're maybe, maybe talking.  You, you fuck with the radio.  Text.  You're looking around at some shit like that.  Yeah, you text like that. 
[01:05:30]  I like to text when I'm going a hundred miles an hour.  When you're doing over a hundred, weren't you just completely fixated and focused on  the road?  I was, man.  You become, like, focused.  It was like, and I realized how fast I was going when he was pulling me over, and I'm  slowing down, I'm hitting the brake, and I'm still going very quickly.  I'm like, oh, boy.  I was speeding.  Yeah, going a little fast.  You don't feel it in that truck, man.  Yeah.  That's, you know, it's fucking, that motherfucker.  Wow.  Did that, and I'm getting my Sirius XM, because BMW didn't have the best of XM package availability. 
[01:06:00]  Fuckers.  That's what I said.  Bavarian motor work, Germans.  So I waited, and they're going to put that in Monday, I think, with the best of Sirius X,  with the best of XM on the Sirius.  I did that with my new truck.  Yeah, nice.  There's one phone call to bladder.  No, no, the radio, I didn't get it, because the Sirius that BMW had, they didn't have  the chips with best of XM capability.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ah, right.  They had Sirius.  But I said, fuck that shit, man.  Yeah.  And I said it exactly like that, and the sales crew looked at me. 
[01:06:30]  I got to get that for my sting.  Yeah, Jimmy, well, I'm proud of you, Jim.  Yeah.  I'm proud of you.  I cruise-controlled on the way home, 76.  76.  Oh, really?  I did a lot of the driving, and it had a live flat seat, and then I gave it to Dodo, and he  drove, and I was fucking, I was lying flat on my back in my passenger seat.  Oh, I love when a seat goes all the way back.  Is Radar Love one of the greatest driving songs of all time?  I know it's kind of a hacky radio bit, but don't go with I Can't Drive 55. 
[01:07:00]  That's not a great driving song.  That's funny to play when we're talking about speeding.  Yeah, Radar Love just goes with your ride.  The only problem with the seats, the front seats that lay all the way back, is that the  seatbelt becomes completely ineffective.  Useless, right?  And in a front-end collision, you'll come out like a torpedo in a submarine.  That's through the fucking engine block.  Yeah, true.  You shoot out like Spock's body at the end of Raffi Kron.  That was very exhilarating, though, man. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  But I got to get those paddles taken up the steering wheel, because it's a thicker wheel  than the Caddy was, and I have little hands, so it's hard for me to drive comfortably.  Like, I want to rest my hands above on top of the wheel.  Yeah.  You know, I like to drive like that.  You should maybe give it a little time and see if you really want to do that.  Why?  See if you get used to it.  Those paddles are a fucking blast, man.  What do I use them for?  I don't shift.  That's for snow.  No.  No, it's for going fast. 
[01:08:00]  It's snowing out, by the way.  Sorry.  Yeah, I know.  It's like a snow squall.  First day of spring, by the way.  Welcome.  That's the new laugh.  That's the laugh I premiered for my girlfriend.  She hates it.  Holy shit.  I do that in public a lot.  She fucking hates it.  That is so creepy.  Yeah, but it's the I'm faking a laugh guy, but having fun.  Yeah.  Then I fucked her again on the rag last night.  Two hippie hoorays for me.  You're getting insane with that, because you were dead set against any...  I would make her sleep on the floor like a dog. 
[01:08:30]  Of course.  She would come on her period.  The whole room smells like Penny's dog.  On the floor.  And I'd kick her off the bed.  That has never bothered me.  Dude, you inspired me.  That's such a fucking animal.  It's just...  That's a rough one, man.  Do it.  Have you done it, or do you just hate it that much?  Were you like, fuck that?  No.  No.  No.  No.  That's a rough one.  Oh, it looks like you pull it out.  It looks like one of those old Carvel cherry bonnets.  Jesus.  Going back a ways, but... 
[01:09:00]  Well...  That's for the older guys.  Yeah, from Long Island.  Mine looks like a fucking...  Mine looks like a cocktail Frank with pimento.  Oh, God.  Hey, someone stuck their dick in olive loaf.  Guilty as charged.  But no, I've done it.  It was really great.  Two or three times this week.  And once was her first dick.  Because she...  My ex-girlfriend liked that, too.  They said it helps with the cramps.  But they're just saying that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're just whores who like dick.  And she's like...  It's your Fletch-Mite-all bitch.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:09:30]  Which is...  So she likes it.  And I've been doing...  I did it the other day.  No blood.  I haven't gotten any blood on my dick.  I had a couple of spots last night.  But no, not really bad.  Nothing says sexy than laying down a towel before you...  Well, you know...  Fuck that.  You're right.  And that is fucking...  I have a white comforter.  Fuck.  I have a white comforter.  Oh, you gotta watch out.  Go through your towels.  Which one am I gonna sacrifice today?  Especially when you're ass fucking first.  So we did a little ass fucking.  Did a little ass fucking.  Holy shit.  And then I showered real quick. 
[01:10:00]  This is 1.30 in the morning.  Washed my dick thoroughly.  And then we're laying in bed.  And she pops in her mouth.  She's giving the old tutor room.  And I'm like...  I'm playing with my nipples.  And my feet are pointed out.  I'm like...  I'm not gonna be able to come like this.  I'm like...  I just said...  I think I said like...  Could you grab a towel?  I gotta dump this in your box.  I gotta dump this in your box.  I gotta put love juice on the penny spell.  Oh, God.  And I said...  I gotta make that thing stink even worse.  Go yank at your plug.  Object. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, my God.  You're the worst.  That is awful.  But she grabbed a towel.  I can't believe it.  I fucking was able to come.  I don't know why.  But Ant...  I'm telling you.  Because I'm doing a bit on it now.  And I think...  BMW commercial.  And I think of you sometimes.  Because you so don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  And I'm like...  I want to be like that.  Not where I want to go down on a girl on a period or...  But where I can at least have sex.  Because I wanted to fuck.  I didn't want to get blown last night.  And I couldn't come in her shitter. 
[01:11:00]  And I even said that to her.  I can't come in your shitter.  Exactly like that.  I'm like, I'm sorry.  I want to fuck it.  I want to shoot a little bit of hip where your processed food comes out.  But I can't.  Women like honest language.  Yes.  I like...  Yeah.  It's not like I like it anymore than when they're not on their period.  But it just doesn't bother me.  You take the washcloth.  You wipe it off.  Looks like the headband from the Revolutionary War flute player. 
[01:11:30]  You throw it in the shower.  Go to sleep.  Yeah.  It looks like one of these little pieces of tomato from my omelet.  Especially if there's a clot on there.  It's awful.  It looks like someone spit cherry gum on your fucking dick.  Like Lincoln's pillow when they took him out of Ford's Theater and laid him in that hotel room.  Your fucking cockhead has a subdural hematoma on the outside.  He put it in at the wrong time of the month, Sam.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:12:00]  Gypsy.  What happened?  That's right.  He's got a bloody penis.  All he had to do was wipe it off with a wet nap.  He left it.  He left it on.  He fell asleep like that.  Yeah, you want to clean up.  Oh, you have to.  You don't want to fall asleep and wake up with that on there.  Your dick's stuck to the sheets and some of her long hair stuck to it.  It's just everything's stuck to it.  It's like a fly strip.  It's like pulling a lifesaver out of mom's purse. 
[01:12:30]  But taste it.  Oh, God.  Party guy laugh.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hey, Vinny's here from the Stress Factory.  Fuck Vinny.  Where is he?  And we got food.  Where is that motherfucker?  You want to take a quick little break?  Just a little one?  I was just going to...  Put down our trope.  I figured I'd just have a few grapes on the air if you don't mind. 
[01:13:00]  I'm eating my omelet.  I see that.  Why don't we take a...  This will be a quick one.  And then we'll get Vinny in here.  Wow.  The crowd's growing.  Friday's the day to see the show.  Got Bobo.  South Bend, Indiana.  See, I remember shit.  Wow.  That was the guy that...  This guy got poked by Kenny yesterday.  Kenny was just a prick to him yesterday.  He was a prick to everybody every day.  I'm like, Kenny, did you have to poke him in the gut with your umbrella?  You just wanted a picture.  Yeah, it's a little rainy out.  So Kenny had the umbrella.  And me, Opie, and Ronnie were out front talking.  Yeah, we were holding court. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, front talking.  And this gentleman from Indiana, he comes walking up to have a little conversation.  Say he's a fan.  He was in here.  He's coming by tomorrow.  How about this?  He flew just to see us.  Just to see us.  A lot of these guys, they don't fully commit.  They just happen to be in New York.  And then they come see us.  Because this fucker planned a whole trip just to see us.  He has nothing else going on in his life.  So he's walking over, and Kenny thinks he's back on the force with his nightstick.  He jabs the guy in the gut with his umbrella and pulls him aside and questions him. 
[01:14:00]  I hope he has a little pokey bruise in him.  A little pokey bruise?  A little pokey bruise in his gut.  We saw it.  And to tell you the truth, sir, even though I know you're a fan and everything,  I laughed my ass off when I saw Kenny poke you.  Well, you got it.  Because it's Kenny.  South Bend, what's your name?  Tracy from South Bend.  All right, girl name?  That's a party town.  Notre Dame and all that, right?  Yes.  Oh.  By the way, there's a guy out there with sunglasses.  Sir, if you're not blind, I'm kicking those glasses off. 
[01:14:30]  My God.  Who are you with the sunglasses?  I'm not blind.  You're not blind?  All right.  Why the sunglasses?  It's so early, my eyes are just too shut.  Yeah, that's a good point, actually.  We forget how early it really is.  From the world.  He looks like a bilked investor stalking AIG people.  Nice crowd growing out.  Oh, yeah.  I have a feeling we're going to have a good one today.  Huh?  Bunch of fucking cocks.  Oh, I know.  Please.  Hey, she's pissed at you.  I didn't swear.  This woman.  Who can see?  It's behind the door jam. 
[01:15:00]  I actually missed.  I could not see you because I see the guy there.  Is that your wife, sir?  Sir?  Yeah, that's my wife.  Okay, I can only see you and Sam.  I cannot see her.  There she is.  Here I am.  Now I see you.  Hello, madam.  Where are you guys from?  New Jersey.  Welcome.  Wow, took the trip.  Oh, wait.  Oh, wait.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Why don't we take a break? 
[01:15:30]  We're going to eat some food.  Some food.  And we'll continue.  We'll have Vinny join the program next from the Stress Factory.  We should make Vinny.  It's going to be a big crowd today.  Suck everyone's dick?  We should make Vinny suck everyone's dick.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  You're talking like that midget?  That's what I was thinking.  Mopi and Anthony continuing.  The crowd's starting to grow out there.  This live crowd thing is going to go away, unfortunately, for a while.  We're moving to the big building.  Yay.  But you know what it's like when a Broadway show closes?  Yeah.  No one gave a shit about it for a while. 
[01:16:00]  Yep.  And then when you say it's going to close, then it's sold out.  Yeah.  Les Mis leaving Broadway.  So when we come in here now on the weekends, on Friday, the place packs out.  Yeah.  By 9 o'clock, you won't be able to get a seat on those bleachers.  Of course not.  Actually, a couple more of our fat fans come in.  You won't be able to get a seat on those bleachers.  Fucking.  You know what, though?  I'm noticing something happening.  We're getting a little more of the female population. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah?  Enjoying this fine radio show.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Still got the fat fucks.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  They're the number ones that we have to take care of.  I mean, it's nice to see some slits.  All right.  Fucking risky business is annoying me.  What?  Who?  What?  Right in the front row there.  Risky business.  Well, he always.  Right.  Yeah.  He said it's too early.  His eyes are early.  Too early.  Stop it.  Oh, he's such a party guy.  Hey, I need my sunglasses, man. 
[01:17:00]  Wouldn't it be funny if he didn't have eyes and just had two balls on his face?  Right.  No, you should put the sunglasses on.  Now I understand.  What?  They're swollen?  Yeah, those eyes.  Huh?  No balls.  No balls.  All right.  What does he look like?  He looks like someone from those 80s movies.  What actor?  Jude Law.  Jude Law?  No.  I'm going to take a guy from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Cameron?  No.  Yeah, Cameron a little bit. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  I can't remember.  You remind me of an actor.  Yeah.  A guy right to the right of him looks like a murderer.  Like, that's the guy.  A murderer.  Oh, yeah.  A clean cut dude from Indiana.  Yeah, he does.  Because your hair is too perfect.  Like, it looks good.  You're obviously very.  He's got those glasses that just say murderer.  And when he nods, his whole body moves.  That's the sign of a fucking psychopath.  And they nod and their chest and stuff.  And he's got the John List sweater going.  Yeah, John List.  What a good boy.  Well, he didn't know how to handle a fucking situation at all, didn't he? 
[01:18:00]  And he got away with it for what?  20 some odd years they finally got him?  What show nailed him?  With that stupid vibe.  Yeah, that's Most Wanted.  American Most Wanted.  Yeah.  And he just started a new family.  Yeah.  What happened to your old one?  I murdered them.  Murdered them.  I started over.  Why would you start over?  Maybe you would.  Or you just live your life as a single dude at that point?  Tired of taking the garbage out of yourself?  Yeah.  By the way, we got Vinny from the Stress Factory studio today. 
[01:18:30]  That's a behaved family, though.  Once you spill the beans.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I had a family before.  Let me tell you what happened.  How do you deal with all the family photos you took?  Is that your father?  Yeah.  Where is he?  Ah, it's a long story.  Yeah.  I love watching all those A&E crime shows and everything like that, and Cold Case Files and  all those great shows.  And you're stunned sometimes that these guys kill their girlfriends and wives.  Done it a few times. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Never had enough evidence to arrest them.  They're constantly trying.  20 years goes by, and they're still trying.  And these guys are still getting women.  Oh, yeah.  And the women know, like, yeah, my wife died.  Then the second one disappeared, and we were out on a boat, and something happened, and  she's gone.  And then the other one's like, I just loved him so much.  He was a wonderful guy, and I didn't know he had killed his two.  What a dummy.  No senses.  There's like no fucking survival instinct of being able to tell that something's creepy 
[01:19:30]  about this guy.  The best is that cop.  He drowned the one.  He went through three.  One disappeared.  One drowned.  And then the third one's like, I think he's innocent.  She drowned in a bathtub.  He fucking missed her bubble.  Jesus Christ.  Either she's the lady from The Shining, or he's a murderer.  By the way, the first one has come in.  It's Matt Roloff, everyone.  Oh, jeez.  Well, you know, it has to be said.  We'll get it out of the way. 
[01:20:00]  And Vinny brought...  I'm sorry, man.  Yeah, go, go, go.  Vinny brought his son in today who, you know, I don't see that often anymore.  I see him when he was very, very...  What old are you now, man?  22.  22.  22 years old.  Looks exactly like Vinny.  He really does.  It's creepy.  It's the same smile look.  You're not sure if the smile is going to finish happily or with an axe incident.  It's an unsettling smile because it's like you can't tell if he's happy or if he's like  pacifying you before the attack, which is very much like his father.  Yeah, very much.  Here's a good part.  I can't...  Like, he's 22 and he's living at home again, and I cannot get him out of bed in the morning 
[01:20:30]  to do any goddamn thing.  So last night, I'm like, yeah, I'm doing O&A tomorrow.  He goes, oh, you need someone to go with you?  Fucking 5 o'clock, he's up.  You need me to pour coffee?  You prick.  Where were you last yesterday?  You found his motivation.  Yeah.  He wanted to come in and see, hopefully, naked girls.  That's exactly what's going on.  He didn't come do any kind of...  We do have Lisa Sparks coming in today.  Oh, yeah.  She's got a lot of cleavage.  She'll pop her tits out for anybody.  She's got biggums. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Great.  She should be in biggums.  She has big, nurturing bosoms.  Yeah.  My brother loves the biggums magazine.  Does he?  Yeah.  Which brother?  I can't say which one.  Is he the same one that likes a fucking vag that looks like Sam's head?  Oh, no.  That's the other one.  That's brother Elmo.  I have no problem talking about him.  He loves it.  Brother Elmo loves a hairy bush.  Ah, really?  The hairier, the better.  That's fucking awful.  It really is.  A little fucking...  This big mangy mess and two lips struggling to be seen as female genitalia.  Dude, he doesn't even want them trimming it up to make it look like something. 
[01:21:30]  He wants it all natural.  Back in the old days, there wasn't a choice.  He wants it just spilling out down the thigh and everything.  He is an animal.  Did he wear hairy armpits?  Huh?  I don't think he goes with the hairy armpits.  I'll have to ask him.  He's an animal, though.  You had to dig through back in the old days.  Part that shit.  Fucking put a Moe Howard part in the top of that hair.  Like breaking apart an SOS pad?  Yeah.  Steel wool.  Just kind of pull it apart. 
[01:22:00]  You know, that shows your age, though, because when we were growing up, we would do this type of...  You'd have to get the foliage out of the way.  No, but you would...  To your buddies, like, oh, last night, you know, and you would do the motion, then you're splitting...  Yeah.  It was like, again, one for the older demo.  It was like the character on Laughin' that would spread the branches and go, very interesting.  Artie Johnson.  Yeah, Artie Johnson.  That's the German soldier.  You'd have to spread that bush apart, shove your face in there. 
[01:22:30]  I bet you they were doing a pussy joke.  I guarantee that's what that was about.  They were getting one by the youngsters.  And he was wearing, like, a helmet.  So, you know, maybe he was.  He was digging in there.  Remember in Born on the Fourth of July, the psychotic mother who didn't want to know anything bad?  Ooh, it's Laughin'.  It's the one with Sammy Davis.  What a fucking son has his legs shot out.  Big fucking penis, Mom!  That was a good movie.  Remember that?  I thought he should have won Best Actor.  That's just me. 
[01:23:00]  Steven S. from Bayshore is pointing out that Big A's wife has never been heard from again.  I am?  Yeah, Big A was married.  Big A was married?  Yes.  To a Trinidad.  And no one knows what happened.  And he doesn't like talking about it.  That doesn't sound like he is.  Where was she from?  Trinidad?  The guy who worked at Burger King.  I loved that segment on our show.  He didn't love it so much because he doesn't like talking about the wife he used to have.  How long ago did that happen?  I don't know, man.  A while ago now.  But she's somewhere. 
[01:23:30]  No one ever enjoys talking about that.  It's never a good thing.  No, but this is suspicious stuff.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Like it was a mail order bride or he was doing something.  Her shoes were found.  Something's not right about the Big A used to be married story.  All legal, but there's something that's just not right.  Yeah, I think he did it for a little payout to keep her in.  Something.  And, you know, she just couldn't stop it.  We don't know, but maybe if he comes by today, we'll talk to him.  President Obama and Jay Leno, you want to listen to a little of this? 
[01:24:00]  A big week for Jay.  Yes.  Start with Monday all the way through.  That's gigantic.  I got it, Jimmy.  Thanks.  You're on Jay on Monday.  The Special Olympics thing is the big get, but how about we start with this one first?  Yeah, let's hear a little.  We land at the fairground down in Costa Mesa.  And I see the fairground where I think we're having this town hall.  I said, well, why don't we walk over there?  The Secret Service says, no, sir.  It's 750 yards. 
[01:24:30]  So I was trying to calculate.  Well, that's like a five-minute walk.  Yes, sir.  Sorry.  Now, they let me walk on the way back.  Oh.  But, you know, the doctor's behind me with the defibrillator.  Wow.  Michelle jokes about how, you know, our motorcade, you know, we got the ambulance and then the caboose and then the dog sled.  And there's the submarine. 
[01:25:00]  There's a whole bunch of stuff going on.  Just kill him.  It's kind of refreshing to hear a president finally talking about all this stuff.  It would be a lot more refreshing if the country wasn't going broke.  All right.  Let's have a little fun with the Obama thing today.  Wait, no, I disagree.  I think it's fine that he went here, like, on a big, to talk to the people.  Yeah, I have no problem.  He's like Fiorello LaGuardia reading the funnies.  I don't mind Obama going here and talking to people.  That's fine.  No, I don't care.  I think, you know, maybe it makes people go, all right, it's not that bad.  If he's on Leno joking, I don't know.  Fucking boring C-SPAN press conference. 
[01:25:30]  I would rather have him be here and get the message up.  This guy hates that he's confined and can't do his thing.  He's hating it.  The way he's talking about these AIG scumbags.  I like the fact that a sitting president hears these guys getting bonuses and reacts the same way I do, which is that's sickening.  You know what?  They're full of shit.  He took a ton of money from AIG during the campaign.  They're full of shit.  They have to say that.  But not really.  Bush wouldn't have.  I'm telling you, man, he wouldn't have.  He wouldn't have said that.  He wouldn't have.  He wouldn't have come out and targeted them.  Anthony just perked up. 
[01:26:00]  Anthony's like, all right, I got one of my guys in the room.  AIG gave a bunch of money to him to get elected.  And now he's saying, oh, don't take bonuses.  They're so fucking full of shit.  Well, hold on.  No, wait.  Just because a company contributes to a guy's.  I like the fact that he's saying fuck them after their campaign contributors.  He's not being a slave to his campaign contributors.  How naive are you?  You don't think he's picking up the phone after?  I'm sorry, guys.  I had to say that.  I'm still.  Oh, please.  Do you understand that shit was in the fucking stimulus package? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  That shit was in there?  Yeah.  That bonuses could be given out?  And that the bonuses that were given out contractually had to be honored.  So, all right.  Had to be honored.  Right.  It was in there.  It was written in there.  And now they're trying to, now they're finger pointing, trying to figure out who fucking  put this in there.  And no one knows who put it in there.  Didn't they say who did it?  It's fucking died.  And you know how that happens?  That happens like this.  Okay.  We're going to do the package.  There's going to be a shit storm.  So, quick.  Put this in the fucking thing before we vote for it.  Because there's going to be a shit storm. 
[01:27:00]  And then we're going to say, no, we don't want to do that.  And you know what they did?  They gave the Republicans 19 hours to read through 11,000 pages of shit and approve it  or don't.  Go ahead.  The bottom line is, they're going after them.  I don't think that he, maybe he should have, you know, but I don't think Bush do every single  thing in the Patriot Act anymore than I think he knows every single thing.  I think he really did.  They said this went to Pennsylvania Avenue.  I'm sure it did.  1,600.  That was the final fucking work.  You know he wasn't looking at it, though, and going, oh, good bonuses. 
[01:27:30]  No one was looking at it.  There's too many pages in these fucking things that are full of what they call pork.  Or they look at it and they go, look, we're going to, this is going to go through and  you're just going to say afterwards that you don't like it, but it's going to be part  of it because these are the people that put you in office.  That's the same thinking as people would use about Bush and go, all right, they're not  going to find any weapons and you've got to act.  It's like they don't have these discussions.  It's like he, the bottom line is this.  I like the fact that he is fucking disgusted by this and he's targeting it.  And you know what? 
[01:28:00]  They shouldn't have jobs.  The fucking government owns 80% of their shit company.  You know what, though?  They should be unemployed.  They are looking at the...  AIG is gigantic.  You can't let AIG go away.  Why not?  Because AIG is in every fucking thing.  They insure the world.  If AIG goes away, everything goes away.  If AIG falls, I'm buying a gun.  I'm insured.  What?  I'm insured by AIG.  Everybody in this room.  I don't have any insurance.  I don't believe in it.  Insurance is for queers, right?  I don't believe in it.  Yeah, I do. 
[01:28:30]  I've got to gamble in life.  Yeah.  I just think...  You know how much money you save by not having any insurance?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  165 million in bonuses.  No car insurance.  No health insurance.  They're looking at how the constitutionality of this whole thing is, how can you then distinguish  where you can then go up to anybody or any entity, any company, and say, we're going  to now tax you at a 90% tax rate.  I understand that. 
[01:29:00]  Where is it said that you can't say that?  It's going to be challenged, and I think they'll fucking lose.  I agree with you.  You can't just say, we're going to tax you 90%.  I agree.  You can't do that.  No matter what the circumstance.  I do agree.  So how are you going after it?  Because the bottom line is, it's this public fucking smashing, which you don't hear.  You don't hear them doing this.  You know what, then?  No more business as usual, as far as these congressmen go, read what the fuck you're  putting in your goddamn bills, and don't fill them with all kinds of shit that the important 
[01:29:30]  stuff, like these guys not getting bonuses, are pushed to the side because you're reading  about a fucking highway project that's going in.  Or fucking night basketball or some other bullshit that has nothing to do with the economy.  Listen, they put that shit in.  They know it's there.  I know they know it's there.  And they know what they say.  Don't worry.  American Idol will have some fucking thing, and the American public will stop paying attention.  They won't pay attention to it.  They won't think about it.  But they got to call it.  You can't just call out the AIG fucking, AGI, executives, AIG, whatever the fuck I'm 
[01:30:00]  paying my god fucking bills to.  No, it's AIG.  AGI is my agency.  Oh, okay.  And those cocksuckers don't deserve a dime.  Fuck them.  You can't just call the fucking company out without calling out the politicians that put  this shit in there and camouflaged it with all their fucking favors that they're doing  for all the people that gave them money to get elected.  Business as usual.  Fair enough.  I don't even disagree with that.  I like the fact that, look, I'm for deregulation. 
[01:30:30]  I want the fucking government owning everything.  But you know what?  That's how Bernie Madoff got away with what he, because people are so fucking scared of  a guy like that.  No one could just look in and see what the fuck he was doing.  So it's like, I'm tired of guys on Wall Street for a long time, have not had their fucking  teeth kicked in.  Well, can we see what Obama said to Leno about the AIG thing?  There's no way to defend these guys.  They're fucking vultures.  Well, let's see what Obama said.  Let's see what he said.  They're vultures.  We talked about it on Leno last night.  I mean, we're yelling and screaming about it.  Let's see what Obama actually said. 
[01:31:00]  I know you are angry, because doing what I do, you kind of study body language a little  bit.  And you look very angry about these bonuses.  Actually, stunned.  Stunned.  Stunned is the word.  Tell people what happened.  I know people have been over it.  Well, look, here's what happened.  You've got a company, AIG, which used to be just a regular old insurance company.  Then they insured a whole bunch of stuff, and they were very profitable, and it was a  good, solid company.  Then they decided, some smart person decided, let's put a hedge fund on top of the insurance  company, and let's sell these derivative products to banks all around the world, which 
[01:31:30]  are basically guarantees or insurance policies on all these subprime mortgages.  And this smart person said, you know, none of these things are going to go bust.  This subprime thing, it's a great deal.  You can make a lot of profit.  So they sold a whole bunch of them, billions and billions of dollars.  And what happened is, is that when people started going bust on subprime mortgages, you had $30  worth of debt on every dollar worth of mortgage, and the whole house of cars just started falling 
[01:32:00]  down.  So the problem with AIG was that it owed so much and was tangled up with so many banks  and institutions that if you had allowed it to just liquidate, to go into bankruptcy, it  could have brought the whole financial system down.  So it was the right thing to do to intervene in AIG.  Now, the question is, who in their right mind, when your company is going bust, decides we're 
[01:32:30]  going to be paying a whole bunch of bonuses to people?  And that, I think, speaks to a broader culture that existed on Wall Street, where I think people  just have this general attitude of entitlement, where we must be the best and the brightest.  We deserve $10 million or $50 million or $100 million payouts.  And the immediate bonuses that went to AIG are a problem, but the larger problem is we've  got to get back to an attitude where people know enough is enough, and people have a sense 
[01:33:00]  of responsibility, and they understand that their actions are going to have an impact on  everybody. And if we can get back to those values that built America, then I think we're  going to be okay.  I mean, it makes sense what he's saying. It's not crazy or radical. I like the culture on  Wall Street, because it's like, we know about crime, we know about a million other things,  but I like the fact that these guys, it's like, you know, the fucking fact that gas was through  the roof, and then it was cheap, and then the whole economy's in the tank. That's fucking 
[01:33:30]  mentality, like guys like that.  But it's business as usual, and now they're calling it out, like, oh, these are the bad  guys. They've been in fucking cahoots with each other, these companies and fucking politicians  for years. This is just the way it's been. They pay them fucking huge amounts of money  to get elected. When they get elected, the politicians look the other way, and they're doing  it right up to this last bill that was signed, and now Obama's coming out like holier than 
[01:34:00]  now, saying all these companies, Wall Street, how about your fucking people you appointed?  How about your fucking head of the goddamn treasury that you appointed?  How does a guy that's a senator for six weeks become president? One way only. You've got  to have big connections, big money behind you.  Of course.  And, you know what, Jim, how come he's not calling out Congress? They just gave himself  a raise.  Right.  Congress just gave himself a raise. He's going to sign off on it. How come that's not?  I honestly don't know, and just because that, maybe he should call them out, doesn't  mean... 
[01:34:30]  Oh, you won't.  ...that he's wrong.  He needs their votes.  ...for calling out fucking... Well, he'd get their votes anyway. What are they going  to vote for?  Oh, you tell them they can't have their fucking raise, they get a little mad.  But if... Didn't they take a smaller... Again, I believe it. In fact, politicians vote  for the wrong raise, we all know his shit. Smaller raise? How about people taking pay cuts  and losing their fucking job?  How about you don't need a fucking driver? How about the governor of New Jersey doesn't...  How about the president of the Senate doesn't need a driver? You can't fucking drive?  You can't lead a country? You can't fucking operate a motor vehicle?  How the fuck is that?  Yeah, you want Patterson to drive it all over New York? What are you, nuts? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  But no, I still... Okay, even if that's right, fine. Doesn't mean that him attacking AIG...  And I don't believe that they had the conversation where they go, well, something will come out  and you'll have to comment, because this is getting the precedent because Obama went after  it. That's the only reason I heard about it was Obama.  No, that broke in the news.  It broke. It broke in the news. Dodd was fucking lying at one point when he got on and said,  no, I don't know who the... He goes, I designed some of the policy, but I didn't put in this 
[01:35:30]  language. And then two days later, he goes, yes, me and staff put together the language.  It's like, you fucking lied two days ago.  So he's a scumbag. I'm not saying he's not a scumbag.  Yeah, he's a scumbag. But then he fucking says, when they ask him, they go, well, who  had the final sign-off on this shit?  Right.  He goes, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Right.  The president of the fucking United States.  But we were just going for a few laughs with this Jay Leno and Obama. 
[01:36:00]  I know.  I like how down home and...  What happened?  How nice...  What happened?  These folks at that...  What happened?  Normal little insurance company, yeah.  Kevin runs the world, you moron.  And Kevin from Connecticut goes, I can't take Vinny serious with his Kermit voice.  He wants us to run your voice through some filters, so...  All right.  So you sound...  What about the insurance company, Kermit?  Everybody left my voice alone for 40 years until you pointed out I sound like a midget. 
[01:36:30]  Wow.  Steven S. actually...  We're losing a lot of money.  Yes.  Steven S. for...  Yes, we are, Elmo.  Steven S. from Basher actually writes, Vinny sounds like he's talking through five syrupy  waffles.  Holy shit, that's good.  Yeah, it's a little...  It's like...  It's like when you drink something like a milkshake and...  Get that bubble in your throat for a second.  What happened to your voice?  I think it's just the years of yelling.  Really?  Yeah, years of screaming.  You just blew it out?  Yeah, I'm really...  You're an angry man, aren't you? 
[01:37:00]  Angry man, married early.  I'm married early.  Years of doing the phone bit.  Is he the married early kid?  Yeah, he's...  I had him when I was like 23, maybe.  Really?  Yeah.  You're bitter toward him, aren't you?  No, I love that kid.  That kid hates me.  Does he love you?  Yeah, he's a good boy.  You don't like him, though?  Eh.  You see the face?  I love the face.  You know, as much as you can.  I love him as much as you can love him.  You know he's going to turn around and like you again, though.  Yeah.  He's going through the stage.  I got to hate my...  Yeah, you're the authority figure. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, fuck him.  He'll be carrying me to the ground.  He wasn't such a bad guy.  Right.  Did he have that AIG insurance policy?  Is that what he had?  Hold on.  Someone also suggested something.  I just want to play it and see if it's accurate or not.  That's all I want to say for now.  Then we're going to get back into the Obama thing because he continues with the AIG.  Give me that devil ale fish.  Give me that fish.  Give me that devil ale fish.  Give me that fish.  What if it were you hanging up on this wall? 
[01:38:00]  If it were you in that sandwich, you wouldn't be laughing at all.  It's almost there.  Yeah, that's pretty close.  Somebody said it kind of sounds like Vinny, but even more so.  It's just it had to be played because me, Sam, and Travis are just absolutely obsessed with this commercial.  Are you?  It's nonstop.  And apparently everybody else is, too, because this is like nonstop across the country.  Are you obsessed with the nanopuss yet?  Yeah!  Nanopuss!  Nanopuss!  Yeah!  Get that nanopuss.  I thought it was the only one. 
[01:38:30]  Nanopuss.  Nanopuss.  Are you a nanopuss fan?  Danny, get it up.  Get it up.  Get it up, Danny.  Get up the nanopuss.  Danny's throwing discs on the floor to get through the keyboard.  Anybody else into the nanopuss out there?  Nanopuss.  You know what?  You're going to be into the nanopuss after you hear this.  Just to waking up.  They're looking at us going, how do they do this every fucking day?  What happens?  Why?  Danny and I are pigs.  Maybe why?  Travis?  Two weeks ago, Danny and I were at the zoo.  Yeah.  And for some reason.  They're gay. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  I have jokes, but I'll leave them alone.  Why did you go to the zoo?  It was a petting zoo.  He was putting his dick through the cage and letting the little llama lick it.  Letting the small, letting the fucking pygmy llama lick his fucking undershirt.  You try to enjoy the zoo and you realize it just sucks.  No, the zoo was great.  We had an excellent time.  You looked.  You're watching the slave trade.  We went with women.  We didn't go by ourselves.  You were at the zoo.  Yeah, we were at the zoo and randomly I was like, hey, what do you think of nanopuss?  And he had never seen it. 
[01:39:30]  So I pulled it up on my phone and we're walking through the zoo.  Nanopuss rules.  And I'm just doing the nanopuss.  Yeah.  What's great is if you want to get the audience on board, Travis does a really great nanopuss  dance.  I'll do you?  And maybe he could do it for the audience.  Yeah.  Damn.  Should we watch nanopuss first?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't it nanopuss or is it nanner?  I think it's nanner.  Nanner?  All right.  Here's nanopuss.  I've never heard of it.  Here's nannerpuss.  I've never heard of it.  Here's nannerpuss.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Here's nannerpuss.  Isn't that good?  Here's nannerpuss.  All right.  All right. 
[01:40:00]  You got to do something, something.  By the way, you're hearing Vinny from the Stress Factory.  By the way, this fucking guy was loyal right to the end as far as K-Rock goes, motherfucker.  Yes, he was.  I hung in.  Still advertising with him.  Go check out his club because he was one of the only comedy clubs that officially advertised  on our show.  Oh, everyone else got the free plugs over the years.  Are we ready for nanopuss?  Yeah, here's nannerpuss.  It's nannerpuss!  You can call me nannerpuss, nannerpuss. 
[01:40:30]  And guess what?  I love nannerpuss.  Isn't it time for a serious breakfast?  This Tuesday from 6 a.m. to 2, Denny's is giving a free grand slam to everyone in  America.  Why don't they?  That's all it is.  They got to go long form.  They couldn't really fully commit to the nannerpuss thing.  There's lots of remixes.  Really?  Yeah.  There's a nannerpuss extended version.  It's 10 minutes long.  Holy shit.  I think someone just looped it over and over again.  Looped it for 10 minutes.  What's nannerpuss meets Godzilla? 
[01:41:00]  I didn't know this was this involved.  It's a craze.  I'm just getting involved with a nannerpuss.  You can call me nannerpuss, nannerpuss.  And guess what?  I love nannerpuss.  Godzilla's foot.  Just squish nannerpuss.  One of my favorite remixes, I don't think it's going to work for air, but it's nannerpuss  versus cookie puss versus Godzilla.  All right.  Wow.  Yeah, there it is.  Nice.  I think Sam pointed out that the best thing about the nannerpuss commercial is when he 
[01:41:30]  knocks his own eye off.  Yes, he does.  Yeah.  He had two eyes and then this stupid banana arm knocked off one of his eyes.  But if we put on the looped version, Travis might be able to stand up there on the stripper  pole.  Well, Sam, I think you're on.  I want to see the nannerpuss dance.  Please, we've got a nice little crowd.  It's still growing up, but we have about a dozen people out there so far.  Well, if they want to see the nannerpuss dance, I can do that.  You guys want to see the nannerpuss dance? 
[01:42:00]  Do it where I'm about to stay.  I don't know how good it's going to be because apparently I didn't do it.  It is good.  It is good.  Thanks, Sam.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'm going to put on the extended nannerpuss.  Wow.  Vinny's son, aren't you glad you came?  We can't get you any.  There's no tits in here, but Travis will do the nannerpuss dance.  It's really easy.  Anyone can do it.  Yeah, but nobody good.  All right.  Here goes Travis.  I'm going to hit play here.  Am I going to be able to hear it?  Yeah, they'll play it over there.  All right.  Cool.  Nannerdouche.  All right. 
[01:42:30]  You can call me the nannerpuss dance.  Hop on the stage.  Hop on the stage.  That's what?  All right, bro.  Nannerpuss.  Travis is doing the nannerpuss.  Do it.  Keep doing it.  Keep doing it.  Song's not over.  Is this the extended version?  And look at the audience.  Look at the audience.  Yeah, we're only 14 seconds in, Travis.  I can't even fucking look at him.  You know what I love?  I can't even look at him.  Not a reaction from the crash.  No, not a thing.  You know why?  Because all it is is just Sam wanting me to do the dance.  Well, who did?  They're not disappointed.  No.  They're not surprised or amused. 
[01:43:00]  They're just like, who's the fan?  I had to fix a crash over here.  A computer crash.  So Pal Talk didn't even see that?  I missed it.  Everyone else missed it.  Oh, no.  Are you kidding me?  I had everything on the...  Yeah.  Derek brought up a really good point, too.  He should be singing the song.  Yeah, that's true.  He always sings the song.  Yeah, what's wrong with you, Travis?  Sing the song.  Sing the song.  This is the nannerpuss.  Have some pride.  And he should be up there for like at least 60 seconds.  All right.  So according to Sam, Travis should be up there with a cordless mic, which I hope someone  is getting. 
[01:43:30]  Yes.  And singing the nannerpuss song.  I think so.  Yeah?  I think so.  God, I didn't know you guys were all into the nannerpuss.  You've got to start talking.  You're not.  There's a lot of singing that goes on after the show.  Love the nannerpuss.  I fucking hate it.  You don't like the nannerpuss?  I can't tell you the level of loathing I have.  Call me nannerpuss.  Did you know about this?  I didn't even know about this.  I've never heard of it.  Yeah, me neither.  I've never gone from zero to 60 with hating something.  Yeah.  So fast.  What annoys me is that that's fucking famous on the internet. 
[01:44:00]  Why?  How little time do you have that you're going to watch that?  It's just ridiculous.  And that this man dances like that is shameful.  It really is.  You know what?  I think it was on during the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  It was a Denny's Super Bowl commercial.  And then it just like disappeared.  And now it's back.  It disappeared for a reason.  They brought it back.  You don't like football, Vinny?  You didn't see this during the Super Bowl?  I did not see it during the Super Bowl.  All right, Travis, let's go.  Let's do it right for the crowd.  Anthony, are you ready?  God, I hope this gets another zero.  Yeah, yes, yes.  I hope this gets another zero. 
[01:44:30]  It's awful.  I'm rolling the dice for a zero.  Come on, zero.  You should just keep going until they cheer.  Well, I don't know if that's...  I'm kind of upset that Filet-O-Fish died.  Fuck Filet-O-Fish.  It's all about the nannerpuss.  All right, here's Travis.  You're going to sing it too, Travis?  Yeah.  I guess if I'll be able to hear it.  You'll be able to hear it, yeah.  And stop being so shy.  Look them right in the eyes.  I'm not shy.  I'm looking at you.  That's your audience.  I don't need to look at you.  They need to see you.  I like looking at you.  All right, let's go.  Right?  Yes.  Here's Travis doing this.  Let's go.  Nannerpuss.  This is ridiculous.  Nannerpuss. 
[01:45:00]  And guess what?  Get out of the way, E-Roc.  Nannerpuss.  You can call me Nannerpuss.  Nannerpuss.  And guess what?  You got to get the time.  You can call me Nannerpuss.  Nannerpuss.  He hasn't done anything.  I'm standing there.  For far.  You can call me Nannerpuss.  Nannerpuss.  And guess what?  I don't know.  I can't get the time.  I'm not Nannerpuss.  He's on.  I can't hear the song again.  All right, listen.  Dance, boy.  But you're sort of getting some laughs now.  Now I get it.  Now you get it. 
[01:45:30]  Now I get it.  Nannerpuss.  Nannerpuss.  Could you knock your eyes off, too?  Danny was just stepping up.  Oh, you want to try it again?  No, no.  Oh, all right.  No, you're on the stage.  You didn't want to leave the stage.  He started feeling good about himself with Nannerpuss.  Maybe Eric wants to try it, too?  E-Roc, you know the Nannerpuss?  I just learned it the other day.  He tweeted about it, so obviously he should do the dance.  He's tweeting.  You can call me Fatterpuss. 
[01:46:00]  Totalpuss.  Fatter douche.  All right, you ready?  This is E-Roc's Nannerpuss.  We're the best at doing visual bits for the radio.  Oh, that's right.  Who's better than us?  Dancing bit for the radio.  Who's better than us at visual bits for the radio?  No one.  Thank you, Sam.  I love Nannerpuss.  You can call me Nannerpuss, Nannerpuss.  And guess what?  I love Nannerpuss.  You can call me the Nannerpuss, Nannerpuss. 
[01:46:30]  There he goes.  Hey, they like the E-Roc version.  Yes, they did.  Wow.  Dancing like one of the old people at the fucking Godfather wedding.  I love it.  All right.  Now we have to get serious again.  Maybe we blow off the AIG shit.  Keep everyone happy.  More Obama stuff, though, right?  You want to blow off AIG?  He talks about trying to get bonuses back.  We already rolled on that. 
[01:47:00]  You want to just bail on that?  All right.  Yeah, I want to hear him talk about the retards.  All right.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  First, we got the, well, one more clip, and then we get to the controversy that everyone's  talking about.  I mean, the front page of one of the rags, no joke.  And they have Leno and Obama on the cover.  Now, it's only, what, 59 days now, right?  Yes, 59 days.  So much scrutiny.  Is it fair to judge so quickly?  I mean, well, look, we are going through a difficult time.  I welcome the challenge. 
[01:47:30]  I ran for president because I thought we needed big changes.  And I do think in Washington, it's a little bit like American Idol, except everybody is  Simon Cowell.  Wow.  Wow.  That's rough.  That's rough.  It's so weird to have, like, a sitting president on a late-night talk show.  That's just, like, laughing and doing things like that.  I like it, though.  Yeah, especially answering these hard-hitting Leno questions.  You could call him.  We're trying to puss. 
[01:48:00]  Puss.  You could call him.  Puss.  Puss.  You could call him.  Jesus.  Wow.  Get it?  I thought he's laughing.  I actually do love that commercial.  I'm a nanner lover.  Now you're a nanner lover.  He got it.  Sing that song at the other side of the glory hall.  Cracking up.  He's cracking up.  Look, he got it.  He got it.  We're finally to the point where he made a little faux pas. 
[01:48:30]  What do we call this?  A little slippage?  Yes.  Yes.  This is slippage.  We were discussing this earlier, before the program.  We'll play it, and then we got a lot to say about this.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot to say about this.  Here's Obama on Leno.  This is the thing everyone's going to be talking about.  Controversy.  They're already talking about it on every morning show.  There it is.  As I say, Channel 11 here in New York talking about what Obama said on Leno.  The fact that he took his dick out on Leno.  I know.  Sitting president.  Imagine if he took his dick out and just put it on Leno's desk and say,  What do you think of that, white boy? 
[01:49:00]  Like, there would never be a more viewed video in history.  Never.  I imagine the bowling alley has been just burned and closed down.  No, no.  I've been practicing bowling.  Really?  Really?  I bowled a 129.  Oh, no.  That's very good.  Yeah.  No, that's very good, Mr. President.  It was like Special Olympics.  No, that's very good.  No, listen. 
[01:49:30]  I'm making progress on the bowling.  See, he said, like, Special Olympics.  Yeah.  And all people just come out of the woodwork saying,  Eww.  They were very angry at his insensitive remarks about the Special Olympics,  of course, being mentally challenged.  No, when they heard 129,  they thought he added up the IQs of everyone in the Special Olympics. 
[01:50:00]  Get it?  Get it?  He's cracking up.  He liked it.  Where's Reverend Al?  He didn't.  Do you think Reverend Al Sharpton should go with this one?  Try to get him fired?  Kind of like what happened to IMIS and Al Roker did a little something like this one.  We have done a little something like this.  This is the problem with something like this.  Now people are calling for an apology.  They wanted an apology from Obama for saying Special Olympics, using it in a joke. 
[01:50:30]  And a lot of people are saying it's just refreshing to see somebody out there like that.  I'm on the other side of this.  I want him to have to fucking apologize.  Guys, I'm calling for his job.  I want him fired from his job.  Wow.  Because for one second, that motherfucker had to sit there and go, wow, I was just going  off with the cuff and making a joke.  Right.  I didn't mean any harm.  Right.  Oh, that excuse doesn't work for us.  It doesn't work for IMIS. 
[01:51:00]  It doesn't work for comedians that get in trouble when they just, it's called comedy.  And it's funny because it's, it's off the cuff like that.  He made a remark.  It was funny.  He got a lot of laughs, but oh my God, a spontaneity throwing in something like that.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I want his job.  I'm still fine.  I'm still thinking about it.  Yeah, I know you are.  Beeping puss.  Beeping.  Jesus. 
[01:51:30]  All me.  Puss.  Puss.  Puss.  Know what this means?  What this means is you're not going to see him on any of these fun shows anymore.  No, they're going to say, look.  This is going to be one and done.  You're out of control.  It's too risky.  Obama thinks he's prior.  Yeah.  A dumb, you know, a dumb special Olympics joke, but that's just as bad as all the other stuff  that got radio guys fired and got Imus in a lot of trouble.  Yeah.  It's worse.  It's the president.  You're the president.  No.  The president should be allowed to say, radio show host should be allowed to say, just 
[01:52:00]  lighten up everybody.  That's my point.  If you're going to fry Don Imus, you've got to fry the president.  You can't say, well, you know.  Look, it ain't that easy, is it?  No.  Is it?  You fucking idiots.  Right.  It's not that easy to sit there under the pressure of having to be entertaining and  funny and not sometimes go, oops, something just came out.  You know, not everything's going to be filtered through this PC fucking filter in your head.  And he didn't even have the pressure of being funny.  He's a president.  No, he's a president.  He just sat there and said, look, I'm going to get AIG's money back. 
[01:52:30]  He could have been a hit without going for the laugh.  Right.  But if everyone's going to be held to the standard, God damn, you got to hold the president  to the standard.  You can't let that guy.  He got the laugh.  And he even, that was a tag because he got the laugh with the 129.  Yeah.  He got the laugh with the bad score.  You picture him bowling down there in the basement of the fucking White House.  And then he tags it with the Special Olympics.  And Reverend Al, you know, he goes for what someone's thinking.  You know, he goes, oh, I just had to be a racist.  And then it shows he's a racist.  Well, this shows that Obama.  He's insensitive to the retards. 
[01:53:00]  Likes to point and laugh just like you and I.  Sharpton should march with the waterheads.  Michelle said I should have gotten a Moe haircut.  Right.  Oh, my God.  It's such a dumb world we live in.  It really is.  Hypocritical idiots out there.  Oh, yeah.  There were so many, like, true laughs coming out of that chair a few days earlier.  It's really amazing how that happens.  Oh, when, who was there?  I don't remember.  Well, I think we might be able to.  God, who was sitting there?  I just. 
[01:53:30]  Julia Louise.  Louis.  Louis.  Louis.  Louis.  She was there.  She was terrific.  I know that.  I don't know who else was there, though.  It's been a busy week.  Who knows?  Keep stalling.  God, how long could I do this?  We know who wasn't there.  Who else was there?  Jesus Christ.  Hello.  Well, I hope you guys appreciate what radio show you're checking out right now.  Okay.  If you don't, you know, Jay Leno said it. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  My name is Joe, a very popular comedian.  You can hear him every morning on the Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show  in the history of satellite radio.  Pretty amazing.  His new DVD, HBO's Down the Journey with Jim Norton, will be available April 7th.  And please welcome Jim Norton.  Yeah.  That's right.  The most popular show in satellite radio history.  History.  History.  Look at him.  That's right.  They know.  Jimmy, how cool is that?  You're on Leno Monday, Tuesday, whatever the fuck the day was, and then Obama a little 
[01:54:30]  later on.  That's fucked up.  A little connection there.  Did they scrub your set clean of any jokes about retarded people?  It was before, so how would they know?  No, they didn't.  Oh, no.  I didn't do any.  Oh, you didn't do a set?  No.  I actually did do a special Olympics.  Not a special Olympics.  A special joke.  Because we were talking about my girlfriend.  And I was talking about something.  I just was filming our sex.  And Jay goes, well, she sounds special.  I'm like, that's what people say.  She is special.  Special.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's too subtle, though.  That's like a, you know.  Yeah, but I mean, it was.  Oh, it was good subtle. 
[01:55:00]  It was an improv.  Yeah.  Oh, he let people know.  I'm calling for Norton's job.  Jimmy's never too subtle when you don't know he's talking about retarded.  Well, then Jay goes, so you say English.  She's a fucking retard.  And I went up and I went.  Yeah, I got home and she went.  Go to the pavement, damn it.  Why don't we, we should play the special Olympics song.  Oh, I know of Obama's joke.  That is hurtful. 
[01:55:30]  Do we have the special Olympics song?  Thumbs up from Dirt?  Why don't we do that?  We'll take a little break.  Lisa Sparks is going to join the program.  We got Bobo in the audience from the David and Bobo show.  Yes.  There he is.  The famous Bobo.  Look, he takes his hat off now and waves it around like he's doing a fucking curtain call  from the dugout.  What do you think of Bobo there, Vinny?  He's special.  He's got some serious ears.  He's got a worse, his voice worse than yours.  He's got Obama's ears.  My voice is a mess.  He actually gets satellite radio for free.  Through his ears? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I got it.  I had to punch it up a little.  I don't know.  Crack it up.  Bobo, say hi to Vinny.  Hi, Vinny.  Hi, Vinny.  Hello, Bobo.  Stimulating conversation.  That's Bobo.  Don't you got anything to say, Bobo?  You usually have a lot to say.  Well, I got some stuff up ahead.  By the way, I got to say, I want to acknowledge my mom's friend, Scott.  But he's down on his luck.  He got laid off.  Yeah.  Aw.  And he actually used to listen to you guys when you were on regular radio. 
[01:56:30]  I didn't know he was a fan until one time he was visiting my mom.  And I'm listening to a replay.  Oh.  Oh.  I thought you were listening to something else.  It happened to be on the radio.  Turn that up so the kid can't hear us.  Because she's yelling, fuck my shitter faster, Scott.  And he's going, turn the radio up.  Oh, my God.  I don't want my kid to know that I like it where the duty comes out.  He was saying, Daddy, what are you listening to? 
[01:57:00]  And I said, I'm listening to the O.B. and Anthony replay.  And he says, they're still on.  And he didn't know they were still on.  That's a wonderful story.  Worst story in history.  And so far, you have the top three spots.  Why don't I get you their autographs?  I was wondering if you could give Scott an autograph.  He doesn't want one.  He doesn't even know the show's on.  He's not a real fan.  He just turns the volume up to keep it quiet.  Yeah.  Because he actually yells things like,  you got some on my dick again. 
[01:57:30]  He actually listened to you guys.  No one is so bizarre.  We have so many fans that are hardcore that don't understand humor.  Like, how does that work?  Like, Stalker Patty is like a hardcore,  but she doesn't get when we're doing jokes or nothing.  No, no.  She's clueless.  It's clueless to what we're actually doing or attempting.  My mother's special friend,  he comes over and I hear noises that I don't understand. 
[01:58:00]  That's right.  And he walks in and fuck with a sling blade  and he fucking attacks them all.  I reckon she didn't mind it as much as I thought she did.  Yeah, her and Jesse.  Guys, by the way, it's egg day.  It's egg day.  And the news crews, the anchors all over New York are trying the egg thing.  Oh, you know what egg day is?  Yes, it's the spring.  When it's spring, the first day of spring,  an egg is supposed to stand up on its end.  Oh, what a bunch of horse cock.  But it's bullshit.  Well, they're all trying it on the news. 
[01:58:30]  Of course they are.  The country's falling apart,  but they're trying to get that egg to stand.  Yeah.  And if it does, you know what?  Oh, go ahead, look, the egg stood.  Who gives a fuck?  Shut up.  And someone will kick it over.  The fucking useless hole anchor women shoot it out their twats.  Yeah, exactly.  So far they could fire an egg.  Welcome to news on the Philippines.  I missed that broad.  The one who used to shoot the eggs out of her vag for us.  She had, it wasn't even, like,  I thought it was going to be she shoved an egg in  and shot it out like a cannon,  but it worked more like a sling. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Like, she had a very saggy vagina,  and she'd lay the egg in there and swing it,  and wham, it would fly out.  Dude, velocity.  Really?  Yes.  And distance?  Yes!  It was like a fucking trebuchet.  Trebuchet.  And when she was laying on her back.  Trebuchet.  Laying on her back with half the egg sticking out.  It looked like it had been poached.  And we were just sitting in that little poached cup.  And the cup, you just tink, tink, tink,  the top off and eat it.  Her pussy stunk. 
[01:59:30]  The little chick actually came out in mid-trick.  You went from that to nanner-puss.  Nanner-puss.  Nanner-puss.  You know, times are tough, Benny.  Yeah.  In this radio world.  Hey, Bobo, what are you doing for us today?  Today, I'm going to give you some news and some comments.  Oh, Bobo news.  Bobo news and comments.  It's called the Bobo log.  The Bobo log?  Oh, like a blog.  No, it's like a bottle log.  Oh, shut up.  I had a blog thing going,  because it's like Bobo log. 
[02:00:00]  Yes.  But you're saying it's like a what?  No, that's when he gets hit for leaving on the rug.  Wait, he's going to do like a monologue?  Yeah.  Kind of like late night?  Like Leno?  Wow.  Yeah, kind of like that.  You should have called it like a mongologue.  Hey, who in the broads next to you?  I don't know who they are.  Well, I was kind of asking them.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Annie.  All right, we got Annie.  And who is this?  Katie.  And where are you two ladies from? 
[02:00:30]  Kansas City.  Bobo's good.  Born in town, New Jersey.  Cool.  We got someone from Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  He's doing his Bruce impression.  Holy shit, Bobo just did a Bruce impression.  And then we got someone from the tornado capital world.  Yeah.  Yep.  You have to have a shot of chromosomes.  Whatever a chromosome is.  I know.  I made the M and N. 
[02:01:00]  I heard, but I got it.  I do that a lot when I'm watching certain networks.  Wow, what was Bobo saying?  I said to her, hopefully a tornado doesn't happen while you're gone.  Oh, wow.  That's nice.  Snappy dialogue like that will keep your dick wet forever, young man.  Go back to the Springsteen.  Give me one more line from Springsteen there, Bobo.  She's from Jersey.  She's a hot chick from Jersey.  And she thinks it's still 1985. 
[02:01:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I was just waiting for the whoa, whoa.  Hey, fantastic.  Goddamn, Bobo is gold.  We have some great improv here, though, by the way.  Yes.  Great improv about to happen.  Stalker Patty.  Oh, Stalker Patty.  Patty, where are you?  Well, I had to open the store.  Right.  All right.  Let's get some stupid store openings.  Good morning.  Can we just throw rocks at her? 
[02:02:00]  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  So did you hear about Obama making the Special Olympics joke on the Tonight Show?  No, I was at a concert my friend took me to because he had an extra ticket.  What was the concert?  Fleetwood Mac.  Yeah, how'd you like that?  I loved it.  It was the best concert I ever went to.  And God bless Mick Fleetwood.  He was on fire.  Well, it doesn't sound like God's blessing him if he was on fire.  Yeah, really.  She can't even make it sound like, you know, wow, he was on fire. 
[02:02:30]  Right.  She made it sound like he literally was on fire.  Yeah.  She's going to explain that, right, Patty?  What do you mean by that?  Oh, you know what I mean.  Come on, Patty.  See what happened?  What do you mean?  What happened?  He was burning?  No, they were just so, they were better than a 20-year-old band, let me tell you.  And they were all in their 60s, and I had to Google that because I didn't know they were  that old.  Wow.  Yeah.  I thought they were all, like, close to my age, you know.  No, no, tell us all about how you found out their age. 
[02:03:00]  Did you Google in quotes or no?  No, I just went home and I went on the computer and did a search just to find out more because  I don't know a lot about them.  How old is Mick Fleetwood?  He's 62.  Wow.  What would you do with him in a hotel room?  I don't know.  He's cute, though.  But I like the guy on the guitar.  Oh, God.  What's his name again?  He plays the lead guitar and used to go out with the...  Oh, my God. 
[02:03:30]  I can't even think.  I just woke up.  Hey, Bobo, what do you think of Patty talking about Fleetwood Mac?  She's terrible.  I guess that's how old she is, that she remembers Fleetwood Mac.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  There is the improv.  There is that improv.  This is the demographic I'm hoping to attract at some point.  Yeah.  I just hope I look like her when I'm her rate.  She's 61.  You look like her after she's been dead for 10 years. 
[02:04:00]  Mission accomplished.  You think you...  Christine McVee or whatever her name is?  She's probably old enough to have been one of their groupies.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I probably was.  Yeah, well.  Unfortunately...  Of course you got to try.  I wasn't.  Existing conversation going on.  More great, great improv.  Who do you want to look like?  Stevie Nicks?  I think she's beautiful.  She's gorgeous.  How old is she?  61.  Holy shit.  Stevie Nicks is 61. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, she's a real cougar.  She'll be a real cougar.  Say it again.  We didn't hear you.  And she had a younger guy.  She would really be a cougar.  A what?  A cougar.  Okay, let's go for five.  She's just attractive for her rage.  A lot of ladies that age are stooped over and walkers, and she's jumping.  Danny wants to play Whose Line Is It Anyway with Patty.  Oh, wow, yeah.  You got to do Patty, Steve, Bobo, and David. 
[02:05:00]  Perhaps David.  You know something?  I know people are sick of him, but that is really good.  Let's do it.  Let's do Whose Line Is It Anyway.  Whose Line Is It Anyway.  You ever watched that show, Patty?  I got a little thing about David.  David, he's a Jew from Jersey, and he's an intern on the O&A show.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I had to say that because David was from Jersey.  Yeah.  And he's a Jew.  We got it.  All right. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  We got it.  He has to do that another ten times today.  He's the greatest.  He's got to do Bruce for the rest of the thing.  Oh, my God damn, Bobo.  Whenever you want to do Bruce, Bobo, you just raise your hand, and we're going right to you.  But make sure you got a good one, all right?  Oh.  When you figure out a good fucking Bruce thing, we go right to you, my friend.  Okay.  Whose Line Is It Anyway, so what?  We need props and stuff, right, in some scenarios?  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  All right.  We'll figure it out during the break.  Are we ready for the Special Olympics song?  Patty's here.  Bobo's here.  Vinny's here for the Stress Factory.

[02:23:30]  I'm taking this to the highest fucking place  I will  Let him know I have fucking had it  And this is going to the highest place  That we have in XM  I always like treating people exactly the opposite  As they're treated on the ONA show  Why?  It confuses them  It absolutely confuses them  And then they think to themselves  What is reality?  And Master Joe finally got to throw somebody out  Just a little look on his face  When me and Dave bum-rushed him 
[02:24:00]  Dave, boy, that was the best  He looked like he was going to throw up  He's quivering right now in the hallway  And he should be  He should be  We didn't even give him a second break  Is he out of the place?  Yeah, Joe is walking  And he said  But I need my jacket  And I said  You maggot interns  Get him his stuff  And bring it down to him  But he's out of this fucking building right now  All I could hear was  Butt-butt Opie  Butt-butt Opie  That's the best  And there you go  Butt-butt Opie  I don't know what happened, David 
[02:24:30]  I got the email  I thought I was doing the right thing  And next thing you know  You got kicked out  On to the sidewalk  That's correct  You were bushwhacked  And they didn't even  They didn't even get to  They didn't even notice  That Scott also walked in the room  They could care less  That Scott walked in the room  No way  They didn't even notice  Scott walked out of the room fine  They didn't even  Attack him  That was the whole reason  I know  They didn't even get to see Scott  Or they didn't even know  That he walked in the room  I guarantee you  That's why they threw you out  They probably didn't see Scott  Yeah  And they thought you were there  To fuck with him  Patty's not 
[02:25:00]  Instead of realizing  That you had a reason to be there  You should probably have Scott walk in first  And then you walk in behind him  Yeah  And then they'll know  Why you're in there  Yeah  Because Ronnie probably thought  You had blown off  What he just wanted you to do  Which was introduce him to Scott  Well I still want him to meet Scott  Well we're going to work that out  We'll work it out  Is Scott here today?  Yeah Scott's here  Alright we're going to work something out  For the Ron and Fez show  Well how would I do it  Without him getting pissed off at me?  I'll tell you how  I know  They like food  He said for me not to be in the building  Listen to me  They like food  Ronnie loves his food  We got to figure out  What Ronnie really likes to eat 
[02:25:30]  And you walk in with the food  How is he going to get mad  If you're holding his favorite dish  He said when he's in the building  I can't be in the building  No no no  How about a fine cigar  Fine cigar  Ronnie enjoys a fine cigar  A nice tipperillo  Yeah  He loves those  Yeah you got to have something  That kind of breaks the ice  So if you got the  Pink tip white owl  That is a kid  A little stupid  That joke is a kid  What are you smoking  A pink tip white owl  Get it?  It's a dick  I actually didn't get that  That those are those  Oh no  Who knows  It's a big cock 
[02:26:00]  Who knows what Ronnie likes to eat  Well I mean he loves a lot of different things  He loves  Alright let's figure out what he likes  We're going to get that  And we're going to try this again today David  And if you break the ice with food  And like Anne said  A nice cigar  I think we're going to have better results  Is Scott going to come in too  Or just me?  Scott will be  Scott  Scott  No don't worry  Yeah the first one  We'll figure it out  We'll send David to the  There's a very nice newsstand downstairs  We'll get Ronnie a very nice cigar  Yeah  And we'll have him present it  And some olive loaf  He loves olive loaf  Make sure it's a good one  That you know Ronnie's going to really like 
[02:26:30]  We'll get the best one that they have there  But what is he like as far as food?  I don't know if the cigar is going to quite do it  We need a  Yeah  Yeah  A few things  Nice pizza pie  Maybe some pastries or something  Alright we'll figure it out  Yeah  We'll figure out what Ronnie likes  Don't worry about it  Try that again  By the way Bobo  We were just talking about Ron and Fez  Eastside Dave  A little known fact  He lives in Jersey  Eastside Dave  He lives in Jersey  He's got a kid  And he's expecting  He's expecting a boy

[02:31:30]  Alright  And see  Yeah  Gotta know when to say and see  By the way  Well, that was about a half hour ago  Very good news  Scott in Virginia  Ron loves the all-veggie sub from Subway  Alright  So, David  A cigar  And an all-veggie sub from Subway  You hide  And we're going to try the Scott thing again  It's a peace offering  That's why I walk in  Like, same 15 minutes  Same thing  But you got  But now  You got the icebreaker  You gotta  I mean  Before he gets really excited  And runs after you 
[02:32:00]  You gotta yell  Hey, hey, Roddy  I got you a peace offering  Alright  But last time  The exact second that I walked in  He got mad  I understand  That's why I don't go with the food  And the cigar, my friend  So I gotta present  Peace offering  Peace offering  Peace offering  Just scream peace offering  Peace offering  Just scream peace offering  Alright, veggie sub and a cigar  You had a right to be there  You gotta tell him  You got a right to be there too  Because he might think  That you're fucking around  But you know you have a right to be there  Yes, I certainly do  I'll talk to this Ron Bennington  He seems like a reasonable fella 
[02:32:30]  But you gotta say  I got a right to be here  He'll listen to you  But you gotta say  I got a right  Don't be a dick about it  How do I start it?  I open the door  And what do I say right away?  You hold your stuff  Right  And he might not say anything  Just go here, Ronnie  Peace offering  Yeah  If he gets loud  Because again, sometimes he does think  Who the fuck he is  You gotta say  I got a right to be here  And then he'll go  What do you mean?  And then you'll show him  The peace offering  And he'll go  What is this?  It's a way to engage conversation  And then all of a sudden  It'll turn into like  Oh, hey there Fez 
[02:33:00]  Look what David brought  He brought a peace offering  Oh, cigars  I love the cigars  I love the veggie sub  From Subway  Sandwiches  We know we can work this out  With Ronnie  I want to, yes  We will  But you gotta  Again  We will  You gotta be strong  Without being rude  Don't be rude  There's gotta be peace  Between the shows  And you're really  The only thing right now  That's keeping that  From happening  And we don't want it  To get worse  I agree with that  So it's gotta be remedied  You know that  You know that  Alright, listen  It's kinda weird  That we got  Bobo Springsteen here 
[02:33:30]  Because we got  A New Jersey story  Bobo  That I'm about to play  Before we do  Whose Line Is It Anyway  It's a big story  Out of Jersey  They want to ban  Brazilian waxes  Why?  Yes, big story  What the fuck?  Bobo, you know  They want to ban  Brazilian waxes  Jesus  But the thing is  Wendy  She needs to have  Her Brazilian waxes  And sometimes  She gets so tired  That she can't drive  Across the turnpike  She's upset 
[02:34:00]  Do you know  What a Brazilian wax is?  Bobo Springsteen  Yeah, I know  That's where you  Remove the hair  From the snatch  There you go  I'm only in favor  Of this story  If they're making it  Mandatory  We have to laser  Those awful pussies  Until it's fucking  Bald and sparkling  Brand new  Really?  Sparkling brand new? 
[02:34:30]  All right, let's listen  This is a quickie  And then we're going  To get into  Whose line is it  Anyway with these guys  Waxing  Some get the hair  Removed just around  The area  Exposed by their  Bikinis  Thus called a bikini wax  Then there are others  They go all the way  Just like the day  They were born  The so-called  Brazilian wax  Well, the state of New Jersey  Calls it genital waxing  Which is not really  On the regulatory books anyway  And wants it banned  I don't think it's fair  Outrage  From esthetician  Monique Nowicka  Who has been giving  The full waxing 
[02:35:00]  For years  For the past three years  We've been doing  About 40 Brazilians  In the summertime  A week  And we never had  Any complaints  Why do they want to ban it?  Because they're ripping  The genitals  To shreds  Isn't  What's the fucking  I think everyone's wild  Pussy lip gets caught  And they do a little damage  Who cares?  Is there more to that story?  Yes  No  I really want to know  What their problem is  Well, you asked  And I'm guessing  I'm guessing  Like a little lip 
[02:35:30]  Gets, you know  A little lip  Gets pulled a little  Too hard  Or something  There were complaints  Not from here  The state board  The state board  Of cosmetology  And hairstyling  Reports two consumers  Injured  In their genital areas  Requiring medical attention  Bikini waxes  Will be allowed  Coming up in mid-April  A hearing on Brazilians  People are going to  Go for Brazilian wax  Whether it's banned or not  They're going to  Find a way to get it done  They're going to  Go to someplace  That's unsanitary  And probably cause  More infections  Now that really hurts  There's too much going on 
[02:36:00]  There's a guy  In line four  Steve stay there  And he's from Jersey  Of course he is  I didn't even hear  The second part of that story  Because of what I'm reading  What was just  Apparently somebody  Was very injured  Very injured  Someone's clit came off  Basically  Okay  Someone hurt their vagina  And then some girl said  That if they ban Brazilian waxes  I'm getting one anyway  Really?  Yeah  So wow  She's a little brave  They'll just be being done  In the alleyways  Next to the abortions  They'll be in their  Back alleys 
[02:36:30]  Get this baby out of me  And clean me up  While you're down there  What happened to the clit?  Was it like when you  You know  Dive in a pool  And you  You miscalculate  And you rub your nose  On the bottom  And you come up  With a nice scrape  They didn't exactly say  They just had an injury  In the genital area  A stumped toe  It looked like they had  A razzle on the fucking  David we thought  We were done with you  We're going to do  The peace offering  With Ronnie today  Because we got  We love you  And we got  We got to have you 
[02:37:00]  On the team  And Ronnie's got to be  On the team  With this whole thing  So the peace offering  Is a cigar  And what did we say  The veggie sub  The veggie sub  Is his favorite  Steve  Because we really  Want this to work  Steve from Jersey  Has got a  Final suggestion  Okay  To bring this whole  Together  This whole thing together  Steve go ahead  What's up boys  How you doing  Hey  One final suggestion  For David  We all know  That Ronnie B  Is a fan  Of spectacular  Big entrances  Yes  And I don't think  That David  Could do anything better  But show up  Blowing an air horn 
[02:37:30]  Before he has  His peace offering  For Ronnie B  Do we have an air horn  Ronnie loves  Like  You ever hear  With the cowbell  You ever hear  Ronnie  With his cowbell  Yes I've heard it  A couple times  He likes  The big noises  The big sound effects  He's one of those  Old school radio guys  Okay  And he likes  That kind of sound  I think if we got  One of those  Air horns  That they use  At the ball games  Absolutely  And that would keep him  From yelling enough  To keep you out  Right  So blow the air horn  And go peace offering 
[02:38:00]  Peace offering  Peace offering  And blowing the air horn  At the same time  Because he's going to have  An initial reaction  When he sees you  We all know that  Don't get scared  So you got the air horn  And go whoa whoa  Hey look air horn  Air horn  Peace offering  Distractions  Distract him  With things he likes  The sandwich  The cigars  The air horn  These are all things  Ronnie appreciates  The exact second  He sees me  He's going to be upset  But then you go  Nah nah nah  Peace offering  Nah peace offering  And you're holding  The peace offering  In one hand  And blowing the air horn 
[02:38:30]  Peace offering  Peace offering  Right  Exactly  Very good suggestion  Bobo  That was Steve  From Jersey  With a very good  Suggestion  For the peace offering  We're going to do  With Ronnie  From Ron and Fez  Steve  Thought of a good  Peace offering  Using the blow horn  Maybe it'll work  Cause he's from Jersey  Welcome back to the  If he wants good cigars  My grandmother  Goes to the Dominican Republic 
[02:39:00]  I'll tell her  And she brings them  Back in her country  I think she's there right now  I'll tell her  To bring back some good cigars  Thanks David  Unclipped gentlemen  Give her cigars  And then they take  The back out  So she never has any  Wow  That's good to know  That Bobo  Alright let's get  These guys out of here  His grandmother's got  A bunch of cigars  In her box  Like that guy  In Guinness  With the cigarettes  Alright David Jesus  Thank you David  Alright we're gonna do

[02:49:30]  Did you know they were cops  Or did you think  They were just a couple  Of your dad's comic friends  Fucking around  They look like comics  Yeah but who defended you  In court  Yeah he bailed me out  Like 30 minutes later  And then I hired a lawyer  Oh you just kind of  Wanted to waste the cops time  For a little while  Yeah waste everyone's time  Money resources  Sure  Yeah  Good idea  You're a fucked up father  Did you fly off the handle  And then realize you fucked up  No I was pretty calm that day  I just said okay you know  Oh you mean when I called the cops  Yeah  About 40 minutes afterward  I'm like oh fuck

[02:50:30]  It's true  So like a month later  He did it again  And I'm like  I told him  If you do it again  You gotta leave the house  Cause he wasn't working  And he wasn't in school  Call the FBI on you next time  Fuck  So I threw him out  DEA  And then he just  We had a pickup truck on the farm  An abandoned 84 Dodge  And he just moved into it  And he lived there for 159 days  Before he would just get a job  That's a good fuck you to you though  That's like throwing me out  I don't care  Yeah  Look what I do now  How many months is that?

He not only pimped it out  He was dating girls  And girls would come to the house  I'm like  What are you here for?  I'm dating Vinny  I'm like  He lives in a fucking 84 Dodge  How pissed off at your father are you?  You're bringing this  And so  One girl comes down the street  Down the driveway  And she knocks on my door  He's like  I'm here to pick up Vinny  And I'm looking at her  I'm like  Holy shit  This girl's at 12  I'm like  What did you feel?  Years old  No  I'm telling you

[02:52:00]  Comforter, pillows  Did you have any like electronics?  Beer pong  Did you sneak out  And back into the house  Like when he was gone?  To get supplies  Like a marauder  No  I had the alarm codes  Oh really?  Oh yeah  But he already did do  That same jerk off neighbor  I'm trying to teach my kid a lesson  Make you know  Go to school  Get a job  Something  She's feeding him  She gave him a fucking scrub brush  He was bathing  In the backyard  In a kiddie pool  Like  Most comfortable thing ever  Yeah  It's like a huge  It's like a huge bathtub 
[02:52:30]  Yeah  Sunbathing  He was just great  He loved it  Yeah he did  He didn't mind it at all  I'd shampoo the whole nine yards  Toothbrush  How the fuck did he eat?  If he locked you out of the house  Uh the neighbors  Neighbor  Oh you said that  But every day?  Yeah  Are we giving you food?  Oh okay  Yeah cause she fucking hates me  So she's trying  Exactly right  And uh  And he's got a good line of shit  So he'd get different friends  To bring him stuff  And  Yeah then  In like November  It was real cold  And I came home from the cellar one night  And it was raining  And there was a drip on his head  The whole time he's in the truck  I'd wake him up in the morning 
[02:53:00]  Like it'd be real hot  We're going to the beach club  Oh can I go?  No  Gotta have a job  Just wanna let you know we're going  Trying to fucking psych him out right?  And the whole time  He's like  Ah I'm just gonna hang out here today  He was just  Railing right down my throat  Like I'm not bothered  And this was fine  So one night  It's like November  And there's just a drip on his head  Like I'm like  How you doing?  He goes  How the fuck do you think I'm doing?  And then  Starting to get cold  And wet  Yep  Oh he broke you huh?  I did  That night was the  Was the breaking point  The next day I got a job

Pharmaceuticals  There you go  That's what got you in the mess to begin with  Yeah  Full circle  Cool man  Alright  I always heard that story 
[02:54:00]  And now I get to see the other side of it  Finally  I won  He turned out good  And you like him huh?  Yeah I do like him  Do you like all your kids?  Yeah now I do  Like it's the stock market  Cause that was part of your set too  It's the stock market  Yeah  I swear to god  Oh we're in a recession  A relationship  That was part of his set  Like he would talk really bad  About one of his daughters  For a while  Well I think it was  One of your daughters  Or somebody  That daughter that you like  In a way that I'm not comfortable with  Oh  I mean  Now I'm liking it  She's actually  She's very funny  She's going to stand up 
[02:54:30]  And she's got balls on  Unfortunately  She's attractive  And she's hot as hell Vinny  She is hot  All of them are funny  But that one I talk about  Cause she talks non-stop  And it pisses her off  And then she gets mad at me for weeks  So  But still talks  Oh she talks non-stop?  All about herself  None  You wanna do stand up Vinny's son?  Yes but not at this point  But yeah  You wanna try it?  Yeah  What are you waiting for?  Just to get comfortable with my life  Balls  You never be comfortable enough to  You never get comfortable enough to do it 
[02:55:00]  That day never comes  That's the scary part  I think that  You never just feel ready  Yeah and the fact that you're uncomfortable  I think might be  You know  Something to go with  With your comedy  You run with it  Meaning the day you're waiting for  Where it's not scary  Or it's like  Okay now it's right  That day will never come  You have to just  Fucking write shit down  And try it  Cause I waited for the day too  I just  I was like  Yeah  I'll uh  I'll uh  And I finally did it when I was 21  But guys I meet now  Who are 35  Say  Dude  I just  You know what man  I was gonna do it  Just fucking do it man 
[02:55:30]  There's no waiting  Just do it  Yeah if you bomb so  I'll give this shit  A little open mic  You should  Yeah I wanna report  Monday  That you did it  Do it as soon as you can  Seriously  Or give yourself a date to do it by  Give yourself 20 days  Whatever to write some jokes down  Just get some stuff together  On a paper  And don't worry about the results  The results are irrelevant  Laughter doesn't mean much  If you get it  Great  If you don't  It's incidental anyway  It'll happen  Start like Jim did  Hi sir  What's your name  What do you do  Yeah  My first joke  One of my first jokes  Vinny goes way back with Jimmy 
[02:56:00]  I think people know that by now  I know Vinny since before  He had the Stress Factory  Vinny was  I remember Vinny used to do this bit  About the Iraq war in 1990  That's how long ago this was  And there would be a big piece of paper  On the fucking thing  And Vinny would do his John Madden  And he would go  Oh we take the offense here  We put it here  And he would do this whole  Really fucking terrific bit  And then there was an Al Sharpton impression  Where he would go  Great white shark attacks the black man  Holy shit  They're calling great  And he had a shitty mustache  That's kind of funny though  It was funny 
[02:56:30]  Vinny's very funny man  Very funny dude  I worked with you then  At Mitchell's Comedy Club  Yes for  So Norton's in scene  And he's doing crowd work  And he's like  Hey sir  What's your name  What do you do  I'm a plumber  And Jim had nothing  Oh okay  Hey how about you  Just seeing if anything  Yes  I was hoping somebody  Would say something amusing  I fuck scarecrows  Then I could just let it  Speak for itself  Yeah  But yeah  You ought to just write it down man  Because I'm telling you  I used to write jokes  In the back of packing slips  And that weird process 
[02:57:00]  People go through  And they're going to try stand up  Or anything that's kind of like a dream  Because nobody wants  A fucking dream shatter  We all want to like think  Someday I'll do it  Because nobody wants the removal  Of that fucking special thing  We think of ourselves  Right  The fucking worst thing you can do  Is wait for the magic day  It doesn't come  Just try it  Give yourself 20 times on stage  And say I'm going to bomb 20 times  Whatever the fuck happens  And by then  And why not  I mean you know  It doesn't stop some people  But yeah you should do it man 
[02:57:30]  You'll regret it  If you don't do it  Alright cool  Yeah right on  Why don't we try this  Whose Line Is It Anyway  Speaking of entertainment  And comedy  And bombing  And bombing  I do want this young man  To see a pair of tits  At one point  Yeah we'll get to that  Who doesn't  I do want to  Who doesn't  Here come the stars of  Whose Line Is It Anyway  Oh yeah  One style  Coming into the studio  Bobo  Just know the comedy  You might know Bobo  As Bobo Springsteen 
[02:58:00]  And the star of the  David and Bobo show  Sorry David  With that said  We got David walking  Into the studio  We got Stalker Patty  Walking into the studio  Who's wonderful at improv  She's the best  Yeah she  I defy you to find  Somebody better at improv  Than Patty  Second to none actually  She's quick  Witted  As far as this gang goes  And then you got  E-Rock  Who has grapefruit juice  In his eye  Is it already E-Rock  No I think it's alright now 
[02:58:30]  You alright now  Alright we'll do the other eye  In a little bit  I'm obsessed with doing  The other eye  You gotta do a double  That would be the best  You got it  You got it  And then Steve C  Who's a wonderful improv  Yes  Absolutely  A guy  Yeah  Alright  Well we got our games here  Okay  The first game is called  Party Game  Right  Now Obi this one  Each player takes on a role  One player in particular  Is the party host  Okay  So we have to designate 
[02:59:00]  One of them as the party host  They're at a party  The players come in one at a time  You'll hear a doorbell ring  Okay  And then the host answers the imaginary door  Because it is improv  You got a theater of the mind  Sure  Answers the doorbell  The players can't say who  Or what they are  Or describe their profession  Or anything  But somehow  They must convey  Who they are  Right  To the party host  And the party host  Must then guess 
[02:59:30]  The role that the players  Are taking on  One at a time  Of course  Bobo  Bobo's phone  His Mets song  Phone is  He's got meat  Hello  It's one of those stupid telemarketers again  Yeah  What was your ringtone?  What is it?  I think it's  Meet the Mets  Yeah  Yeah exactly  It was one of those stupid telemarketers  I do it  Are you late on your  Are you late on your warranty for your car?  No  No  Yeah I get that stupid one  I say 
[03:00:00]  We all do  Trust me  I want to strangle that motherfucker  And he tells the guy  Listen  I don't own a car  So why the heck are you calling  If I find out  Who you are  I'm going to email  A picture of my junk  So what song is that  On the fucking phone?  You like the  Meet the Mets song?  Yeah  I got a  I got a few things on my phone  Do you like those  Meet the Mets songs?  Yeah  I'm a huge Mets fan  So that's why I put that one  I couldn't tell  Meet the Mets  Yep 
[03:00:30]  That's just why I put that  I also  I also put  For my sister  I put the dog barking  Yeah  By the way  I also want to point out  That Bobo  The star of the David and Bobo show  Is our only listener  That is sponsored  Yeah apparently  Mr. Mets sponsored his brain  Look  He's got sponsorships  All over his jacket  I know  He's like a NASCAR driver  He's endorsed by Pepsi  What'd you say Jimmy?  Actually I don't have any sponsors  This is just a NASCAR jacket 
[03:01:00]  Oh  I was sort of going for a jacket  Oh literal Bobo  I know I push buttons  But every once in a while  I try to get a line in there  Thanks for going with it  The sponsorship joke  God forbid I go with that  With all the logos  On your fucking body  Alright  Are we ready Anthony  For whose line is it anyway?  Yes  Now we need to choose a host  Of the party  Danny  Any suggestions?  I think Patty would make a great host  What?  Patty would make a fantastic host  You guys like Patty as the party host? 
[03:01:30]  Of the party  Yay  I believe the other  Well let's talk to Patty  You want to be the party host?  Yeah  You think you could be the party host?  Yes  I'm a very good host  Now Patty  Welcoming  Do you understand the rules  Of the little game here?  Yeah  I'm not supposed to say who it is  But they're supposed to act  That we're supposed to guess  Right  Wait wait  No no  You're not supposed to say who it is  Look look  You're the host 
[03:02:00]  Yeah  The guests will be coming in  Yeah  And they will be told beforehand  Who they are  But no one else will be told  You won't be told  Because you're the host  Then the guest has to  Talk about themselves  And stay in character  The entire time  Right  Until Patty guesses them correctly  Until Patty guesses who they are  Now it could be a person  It could be a certain profession  It could be a number of things  But then you have to guess  Who or what they are  Do you think you could do that? 
[03:02:30]  I think what we should do  Is we could turn off those monitors  So that these guys can't hear  We'll take away their headphones as well  And then you guys can whisper  Who they are  So the audience can play along at home  So they can play along at home  That's a great idea  Like password  Alright  What else we got, Ant?  So then we got  The people that are coming in?  Yeah  Then the people that are coming in  Who are the rest of the  People  They will have the professions  Or who they are  And they will come in one at a time 
[03:03:00]  When you hear the doorbell ring  Okay  Patty answers the imaginary door  Let's the person in  And the game begins  Perfect  With the person saying  Hi, how are you doing?  Like an example would be like  Let's say you're a carpenter  Cool  And you would come in and go  Oh boy  Wow  I have a load of 2x4s outside  And then Patty would go  Oh  You want to stick them up my cunt?  Excuse me 
[03:03:30]  Let me brush off all this sawdust  All over my hands  Very good, Danny  See?  You're a sawdust carrier  Oh, Ted  I'm very good at this game  We might have to  We might have to  Throw Ted in there  As a guest star  As a guest star  Of the game  Is it anyway game?  I'm never lost  Alright, let's  Should we get  Should we get  Should we get everyone out of the studio  And get the game going?  I believe so  Alright  Patricia, are you ready?  Do the 
[03:04:00]  Do the other contestants  They can sit on the couch  You want to do that  And they jump off  Or do they have to be out of the room?  No, I think I would prefer them  To be on the couch  That way if we whisper  Professions into the mics  They can't hear it outside  Yeah  If we spell it  They won't know  Yeah  So, now  Now, Patty  What  I think, Sam  Have you assigned their  Their characters?  Oh, why would the mic work?  Sam?  David goes  No  Yes  The secret papers have been assigned  And I'll hand them out  Okay  Don't show anyone your papers  Right  Okay, let's get that done 
[03:04:30]  Now, Patty  Don't forget that  When this game starts  You're the host of the party  So don't  Don't run for the doorbell immediately  Maybe you're  Setting the party up  You're hoping all your decorations  Are in order  Let's get a little  A little dialogue going  It's not just the people coming in  And you sitting there  Guessing like a game show  This is improv  Yeah  You have to actually become  The hostess of the party  Right  While you're trying to  Figure out who these people are  It's supposed to be  Humorous  Have you ever watched the show?  Whose line is it anyway? 
[03:05:00]  Where they all act out things  There's an audience  And there's an audience here  And while they're doing this  It's not just like a game show  They're making the audience laugh  With their funny  Impromptu banter  Okay  Got it  Got it  Hit me with a shovel now  I'm thinking as  Before the doorbell rings  Patty you gotta kind of talk  Like you're setting up a party  Maybe there's already  Imaginary people in the room  Right  Like hey where's the chips  Where's this 
[03:05:30]  Where's that  You know what I mean  Like you're  Paint the picture  We like to say in this show  Of what's going on  You're the party host  The party is sort of happening  And your guests are arriving  What I want to hear  I'm Alzar Cowie  And just have  Your head cut off  Oh do you think  He wants a piece of cheese  Oh I don't know  I might fix him a sandwich  See it's that  That's why this is gonna work  It's that kind of gold  Oh my dear sweet  Jesus Christ on the cross 
[03:06:00]  Alright  Are we ready yet?  Yeah  Oh are we ever  Yes their monitor is off  So if you guys want to  Fill in the audience  Well Patty's looking right at us though  Well we need the first  Patty earmuffs  Earmuffs  I'll do this  Earmuffs  Earmuffs  Earmuffs  Close your ears  Alright  Let me see  And Sam maybe we could  We could figure out  Some kind of order  For them to come in  I do it like this  What is it?  Well I think we should wait  For our first guest to arrive  I don't know what it is  Right  And I'm gonna do some white noise  Just to mess it up a little bit  For Patty too 
[03:06:30]  So go ahead  Alright  Are you gonna give the  I don't know what it is  Well I think  I think what we should do  Is as the person comes in  That's when we will let  The audience in on  On what their character is  Yes on the gag  Oh  So let them come in  And  Alright  Why don't we just tell her  Who everyone is right now  Dang  We'll get them out of the way  All right  Well Patty  Go along  We'll start right now  Well Patty needs to hold  The microphone though  She needs a wireless  Or that  Yeah  Out of the  And now 
[03:07:00]  Patty is starting  Her  Her improv  As the hostess  Of a party  And Patty  Go  Oh  Oh my god  I got so much to do  And all these people  Are gonna be here  Really quickly  Oh my god  I didn't put the tablecloth  Down yet  And I still got the stuff  In the oven  That's on 300  I gotta make sure  That's there for five minutes  Oh my god  The next  The first person's gonna come  Any minute now  And  I'm not quite ready

[03:14:00]  Yeah exactly  There's no reason  Why would separate conversations in party chatter  Make great radio  That's what I was trying to figure out  Because I saw those two talk  Or at least don't mic it  There's no reason  I was holding it down here  I understand  This is exactly what we wanted  That started  Oh I know  This is exactly what we wanted  Erock and Bobo started that  Yeah  And then Steve jumped on the bandwagon  All right  How about  Steve  Interact  You want to just move on  Tell Patty who everyone was  And we'll try the next game  Do we care 
[03:14:30]  Well Bobo was a big game hunter  That's right Pat  Big game hunter  Big game hunter  You didn't figure that out  When I made  When I said  I came  I came back from a trip to Ted's  Assorted meats  Emporium  That was a dead giveaway  And then I  Did I smell like the store  God I just got back from Africa  Or something  Wow  But Ted's meat  And buying meat  Always means that  You're a big game hunter  Yeah  Oh wow  Erock was a  Lying politician 
[03:15:00]  But he wasn't lying  Yeah  He wasn't lying  Anyone else notice that  I know  He was just saying like  Hey are you voting  I could tell he was a politician  He was just a politician  But he wasn't lying  Yeah you weren't lying Erock  Maybe he went around saying  That he looked good  He was in shape  Look how  He should have said that  Like look how skinny I am  Don't you want to vote for me  Yeah Erock  He'd be like  Oh lying politician  What did you say  That should have cued Patty  That you were a lying politician  I don't know  I suck at this game 
[03:15:30]  I don't know  Hi Patty you have value  Yeah  And then Steve  I got one right  Steve was a spy for the KGB  Patty sort of got that right  Oh secret agent  Oh yeah sort of  Okay then that counts right  Secret agent  Shut up  Alright whatever  Yeah secret agent's good  Heirs  Danny which one do you want to move on to next here  Oh we could do something  A little less complex  I know  I know this was very hard  For all parties involved  Yeah let's dump it down even more  Maybe we could just  How come  Erock and Steve  Were the two dumb people  In that game 
[03:16:00]  They were supposed to be the filler  Yes  They were kind of the filler  Yeah I thought they would be like  The ones to help it along  When it was like  Spiraling into the toilet  Dumb people in the game  Well I think we could do  I think it's hard to fuck up prop work  Prop work  So maybe we could do the prop game  Alright how's this one work  This is very easy  Yep  Yeah  Oh Danny  No go ahead  Be my guest  Well I'm just reading off  Go ahead it's your show  Well you know  What the fuck am I  Teams of two 
[03:16:30]  Take turns using props  To make funny quick scenes  Teams have to stop  When the judge buzzes  What does that entail  The stopping part  Whenever you deem that they're finished  Or when it's obvious  That they're finished  You could just buzz  And then we move on  To the next team  To the next one  Yeah  Okay so they just have to be funny  With the props  I kind of thought more people  Saw the television show  No no no  I've seen that  But I didn't understand  Where it ended  It's up to you  There's really no 
[03:17:00]  There's no rhyme  It's whatever you feel  Yeah this one is just be funny  It's just for fun  Be funny  So we have a whole bunch of props here  And we'll dole them out  As we see fit  And uh  Alright well great  Since we have five  We'd probably just do two teams of two  And one person sits out  Okay  Who sits out  Um  That's up to the hosts  Well I know  E-Rox it's out  Yeah E-Rox sucks  Oh  Yeah E-Rox  Takes things too seriously  Yeah  You see his acting  He was really trying to act  I think she has a gift  Hello ma'am  I think she has a gift 
[03:17:30]  Jesus  Alright what do we got  What are some of the props  For the audience at all  Oh my goodness  Uh  Opie we have a  A big foam hand  Uh huh  That is shaped in the  Shaka  Right  Insertion  A finger thing  We have a hard hat  A wow hard hat  Okay  A hand on a string  A wig  A wig  Um  Yeah  Uh  Some  A thong  Underwear  A broom 
[03:18:00]  Um  Here we got that  I said the hand on a  A string  Yeah  Wow just a bevy of props  Alright  Here don't we  Are you gonna hand the props  Or they pick up whatever one  They think they're comfortable  No  We'll give them  They'll be assigned props  Okay  I was thinking maybe the two teams  Would be um  Bobo and Patty  And Steve C and David  Since they get along  That uh  Seems like great teams  Yeah there's something  Between David and Steve C  Let's start the prop game  Uh you just continue  They'll hand you props  You have to do funny things 
[03:18:30]  With the props  And make the audience laugh  That's just your goal  Prediction  This is going to be  A disaster  Oh totally  And when you hear the buzzer  Just stop  And then the next team  Will take over  So Sam has a broom now  And he has handed a broom  To Bobo  Broom goes to Bobo  Who's eating it  And the crowd will decide  Who did a better job I guess  Is that how  It doesn't  It's not like anybody wins  We all lose  Yeah we're all losers  Including the listeners  You're right  You're right  And the wig  And the wig 
[03:19:00]  Alright so we're giving  The wig just to uh  No Sam let him  Let him use the same one  Go back and forth  And then give the other one  To the other team  Yeah  Yeah yeah  Alright so  Bobo's gonna start  Bobo  I thought Sam saw this show too  Bobo and Patty are gonna start  They uh  They got the mop in their hand  Go ahead  And they have to do  Funny improv with it  They just gotta do  Funny improv  Just off the top of your head  Whatever you think's funny  With the broom and Patty  And interact with each other  And go  I'll get you my little pretty

[03:20:00]  See  Go back and forth  Alright  Boy that was magic  I might find my car here somewhere  The one I came in on  It's over  See Patty it's over  Should it go back and forth a little bit though  To really frazzle him  It should go back and forth  And you don't stick with the same thing  Like you kind of make things up  As you go along  Like you're the witch on the broom  And then he gets it  And makes a gun  And then when you get it back  Perhaps you can make something else out of it  You gotta make something else out of it  Like you're shoveling snow  The witch thing's over at that point 
[03:20:30]  Yeah the witch thing  You did it already  Yeah  So let's try it again  This is improv  Let's try it again  Back and forth  Let's start with Bobo  You want a different prop?
