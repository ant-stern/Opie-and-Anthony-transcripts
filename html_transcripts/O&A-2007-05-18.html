<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews and a news report showing beachgoers, which transitioned into a recounting of their visit to their old workplace, WNEW.  This led to a lengthy segment about a former, "handicapable" mailroom employee with a garbage fixation who was inexplicably promoted despite his incompetence and staring at women's breasts. Opie detailed taking him to lunch and shared anecdotes of his numerous workplace blunders, including misplacing mail, giving away prizes, and hiding microphone flags.  Opie also mentioned the possibility of writing a book about their radio station experiences.  This segment included tangents about their upcoming comedy tour (featuring Bob Saget, Louis C.K., and others), a video of Bill Burr getting hit by a donut, a news reporter's on-air flatulence, and a video of a turtle attacking cats. Listener calls contributed stories about their own flatulence experiences.  The segment concluded with Opie relating a vacation anecdote involving his girlfriend's extreme flatulence.  Comedian Bob Kelly was a guest in the studio throughout this portion.

The show continued with a discussion about the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour,  highlighting the strong ticket sales and the anticipated appearance of "Dance Dance Danny."  They then recounted a poker night where Danny unexpectedly won, leading to a discussion of poker strategy and the legality of home games.  Numerous crude and sexually suggestive vacation anecdotes from Aruba and Cabo San Lucas followed,  featuring encounters with beach vendors, questionable parasailing operators, and observations about local women.  Anthony's wife's near-death skydiving experience while wearing a G-string was also detailed.  The hosts discussed a news story about a bikini-clad coffee shop drive-through and the resulting tip increase, and a caller mentioned a topless donut shop in Maine, sparking a conversation about hygiene concerns and stories about strip clubs with food service, including one about a man unknowingly spreading strep throat.  A snorkeling trip with an overly dramatic ex-Navy SEAL was described, along with Opie's girlfriend flirting with a trapeze artist and his own disastrous trapeze attempt resulting in accidental nudity. "Dance Dance Danny" made a brief, intoxicated appearance.  The segment was punctuated by comedic interruptions, sound effects, and inside jokes.

The final segment began with more flatulence anecdotes, including details about Anthony's excessive flushing habits.  This segued into a discussion about microchips implanted in Alzheimer's patients for identification, sparking a debate about ethics and privacy, along with humorous tangents about elderly people and their olfactory similarities to babies (described graphically).  A humorous photo of Danny led to crude jokes about his physique.  A substantial portion focused on the reality show "Little People, Big World," analyzing the family's dynamics, with further commentary from caller Tony.  Several audio clips were played: a woman crying for her father during arrest, an unintelligible clip from a home movie, and a base jumper's accident.  The show concluded with promotional announcements for Bob Kelly's stand-up shows and FH Riley's restaurant.  Danny was also a guest in the studio during this portion.

[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:30]  Well, you probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32. 
[00:04:00]  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  I probably don't apologize.  Go away.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  I just think Nazi, and I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  I'm a little Jim Norton.  Hilarious.  Hilarious people.  You guys ready to laugh? 
[00:04:30]  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:05:00]  Hi.  How is everybody today?  Dare I say dandy?  I'm terrific.  In studio, Bob Kelly.  Bobby.  One of the comedians that will be part of the ONA Traveling Virus comedy tour.  That's because Jimmy's away.  Where's Jimmy?  Nashville. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  So, we'll get to know Bob Kelly.  Are you getting psyched for the ONA Traveling Virus comedy tour?  Yeah.  I mean, the next place is in Jones Beach, right?  June 16th, baby.  Eight or nine comedians, and the ONA Village, and the tailgating.  What exciting.  Tickets are on fire this week, by the way.  Oh, yeah?  People getting so excited, they're buying their tickets in droves.  And then they've got to buy them again because they burn?  What did you say?  Well, yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Tickets are on fire?  That sounds very dangerous.  You're on fire, so you should.  So, every person listening should buy two tickets.  Clear, yes.  One that will go up in flames, and the other one you can use to get into the show.  There's something else about Jones Beach.  Is Danny doing Dance Dance Danny at Jones Beach?  I certainly hope so.  What venue will Danny be doing Dance Dance Danny?  There he is.  Bob, you want to see Dance Dance Danny?  Oh, this is great.  Where's his music?  Of course, why would E-Rock have it all queued up, ready to go, knowing that Danny walks 
[00:06:30]  in the studio?  Why would E-Rock have it?  That's one of those things we would love to just have at a moment's notice.  Can we call Danny the big rego?  Oh.  Oh.  Here's Dance Dance Danny.  Look at Danny.  Go.  I can't even commit.  Danny had a rough night.  What else is new?  I think Danny had a drive home drunk. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  No, he was sober by the time that stupid game ended.  What, it was Poker Night Ant?  Poker Night.  We're not going to get anything out of Dance Dance Danny right now.  It was fun.  And Danny actually won.  Won the whole thing.  Bastard.  Totally sucked out on me.  I was beating him.  I had two pair.  Went all in.  And it turned out he had a straight draw.  And it was like, well, and we're all sitting there going, well, Danny, the only card that 
[00:07:30]  you could win with here is an eight.  What comes out?  The eight.  Suck out Danny knocked me out.  And then apparently, Than had the same fate.  He had a good hand.  Or at least, you know, a good heads up hand.  So much for that strategy, huh?  So much for that poker strategy.  No, it worked great.  That's why I say poker is all about luck.  It worked great.  It's all luck.  But luck is a factor. 
[00:08:00]  But, yeah, then Than got his ass handed to him by the week's champion, Danny.  How much did Danny win last night in this illegal poker game?  Oh, my goodness.  Well, you know.  We play for pennies.  The house does have to take its cut.  You don't take a cut.  That's where it becomes illegal.  It's legal to have games at your house.  Right.  You could have cash games at your house.  And it's fine as long as the house isn't making money.  Like, usually, at a casino, they make money because they take a little bit out of the pot. 
[00:08:30]  So if somebody gave you, like, 20 for your wheat thins and your ginger ale.  Exactly.  And it's bagels and club soda, my friend.  You know what?  I don't want any flavor.  Ginger ale.  You got me into club soda.  I feel like an old Jewish guy now.  Isn't it awful?  It's awful.  But there's something about it that makes you, I don't know, there's something you crave.  It's the bubbles.  It is the bubbles.  Because when you're out and you're not drinking, it almost feels like you're drinking. 
[00:09:00]  You put a little lime in there, have a swizzle stick sticking out of it, some ice to clink around, and you're drinking.  You're just not getting drunk.  So everyone around you is extremely annoying because they are drunk.  You make that same face like it tastes like crap, but you're getting it down.  The whiskey face.  You get me addicted to that three-card poker.  Oh, isn't it the greatest?  Oh, you like the three-card.  I couldn't stop.  Yeah, it's very obvious.  You just got back from vacation, Aruba, and you were playing the three-card. 
[00:09:30]  Why weren't you playing Caribbean poker?  No, that's the sucker's game.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, that is a...  Three-card's kind of fun.  They love it down there in the Caribbean.  Three-card, they almost give you the illusion that you have something to do with the game.  Yeah, but the thing is, you can show people your cards.  I know.  It's like...  You can just be like, yo, check this out, dude.  And the deal is right there.  In some casinos, they frown on that.  They yell at you.  Really?  No showing the card.  Oh, there goes Danny.  Danny, did he just dance out of here?  Yeah.  He must have.  The music's playing.  Dance, dance, Danny. 
[00:10:00]  There he goes.  Dance, dance, Danny.  Will that happen at Jones Beach?  I certainly hope so.  We'll have to wait and see.  Anyway, yeah.  In some casinos, they yell at you, though.  They're like, don't show the cards to the person next to you.  Don't show...  Keep them above the table.  Don't do that.  Don't touch them until the call of the rest of them are out of the machine.  Ah!  They go crazy.  It's such a watching game.  You do nothing.  Let's be honest.  You do nothing in three-card poker.  And they have all sorts of crazy rules, like I'm saying.  Like, if you try to pick up your cards and look at them before the deal's even done, 
[00:10:30]  they completely freak.  They freak out.  What the hell are you going to do?  But I've been to some casinos where they pick them up before the machine's done dealing  them out, so it doesn't matter.  You can't take the cards off the table.  No, they have...  You can't even take them back.  Nope.  And, like, they have to stay over the surface of the table.  My girl kept taking...  Because, you know, I was playing with my girl, and she kept taking the...  She got, like, into it real quick, and it was fun.  I think she got...  She got three threes firsthand.  Oh, that's nice.  First hand.  First hand, three threes.  A little beginning of a bump right there.  Absolutely.  Yeah, 30 to one. 
[00:11:00]  And then she kept taking her cards off the table.  And the guy was really nice, like, excuse me, ma'am, you can't do that.  But she'd get so nervous and excited being there that she kept doing it, and it just  bugged...  I was like, did you...  You know, did you hear the guy?  Oh, it bugged you?  Are you stupid?  It bugged you?  Yeah, because it's like, listen, you know, it's cute after...  Oh, I keep forgetting.  I'm sorry.  And she makes that little cute face.  Yeah.  And you're a little embarrassed, because it's like, look, you're playing cards, and you're  letting her play with you, and we're having fun. 
[00:11:30]  But really, honey, I'm trying to win some money here, and you're here, so...  I'm working.  Stop with your fun.  I don't want you to go and, you know, hang out with some, you know, Dutch, you know, Aruba  dude.  That's going to murder you?  Yeah.  Some dude with a good...  That's the problem with going on vacation.  You always have to worry about the people hitting on your chick.  The natives don't care.  The people that work at the resort and take you on the excursions.  Their whole life is, like, making sure they have the perfect tan.  The Contiki Booze Cruise. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, and not an ounce of fat on them, and you're just Joe Slob from New York just trying  to get away for a week, you know, and get some sun.  They've had time to cultivate every line that works on American women, and they take you on  the Contiki Cruise with all the beer and sangria you could drink.  So you're half passed out, vomiting off the back of the boat, and they're consoling your  loved one, you know.  Take your top off.  Why would you want to...  Look at your boyfriend. 
[00:12:30]  What is he doing, man?  You get so paranoid that, like, you know, your chick goes, hey, I'm going to go to the  bar pool, get a cup of Corona.  Bar pool?  What?  I'll follow you.  I got to go to take a leak anyway.  Don't go alone.  I'm going to see what the menu is down at the restaurant.  No!  No, hang out.  I just got to take a shower and get dressed.  I'll be done in three minutes.  You're taking, like, an army shower.  Run out. 
[00:13:00]  Don't let her alone for a second.  You go away for a week.  By the second day, you're beyond paranoid of everyone around you.  Stupid towel boy.  Like, what is his agenda?  You let her out of your sight for three seconds.  She's walking back to the room like John Wayne.  You're just like, oh, oh, they got her.  Oh, they got her.  The thing is, though, is you'll see her over there talking to this guy, and he's smiling,  and they're laughing.  Then you go over and ask for, like, a towel, and he hates you.  And they throw it in your face, right?  Yeah, he hates you.  It's like, what the hell were you doing with...  What was she? 
[00:13:30]  Funny?  Is she great?  Hilarious?  Does she be a comedian?  This is what I do for a living.  You know what's great?  Bob was bummed out that they didn't flirt with him, too.  Yeah.  What did you want, a little flirt from the towel boy?  They have no tan lines, you know.  No.  Do you know, though, it's also because they're women.  No offense, Arubian women or whatever, but most of these women, you know, you bring down  one of these American girls that got it together, their nails are painted, their toes are the  same color, and their backs don't look like wrestlers. 
[00:14:00]  I mean, half of these women...  You remember the monster that used to chase around Bugs Bunny, the shoulder monster?  Yeah.  They all have that back.  What is the shoulder monster now?  Oh, people!  The big shoulder monster.  Gossamer.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah.  He knows all that.  See, you're like me.  I would say shoulder monster from Bugs Bunny.  He knows the name.  Where Bugs did his hair up in curlers that were made of dynamite.  Right.  And then he lit it, and his hair was peeled back like a banana peel.  And then the next scene, he was fine. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know how cartoons do that.  Yeah, sure.  All those women down there are atrocious.  Yeah.  Yeah, they all have fat ankles hanging over their sneakers, and their flat backs, just  they look like the rock from the back.  The rock.  The rock says, you want beads in your hair.  No, I don't really.  Move on.  They walk back and forth on the beach and just harass you.  Yeah.  You cannot just lay there.  You have to make...  It's the stress. 
[00:15:00]  It's supposed to be relaxing, and I'm stressed out laying on the beach making...  Make believe you're asleep, honey.  Make believe you're asleep.  You got to play dead like a bear is coming over to eat you, because they're trying to  sell you everything.  Would you like to buy a shell?  I can see one five feet down the beach I could just pick up.  Leave me alone.  Would you like to buy a metal necklace I just made and wear it in the hot sun?  I got to get...  Yeah, exactly.  The other thing's burning across in your chest.  And the problem is, if you buy one, then...  Oh, then they come over.  The word's spread. 
[00:15:30]  Because they see you got something, and then they know, yeah, hey, there's a sucker over  there.  But they see that you're laying in a nice reclining chair.  You got the umbrella.  You got a drink in one hand.  You got that hungover look.  You're just laying down.  And yes, I want to go parasailing.  No, I want to lay down.  Jet ski.  You want to jet ski today?  Do I look like I want to...  I'm sleeping.  I'm in bed on the beach.  Consider me in bed on the beach.  Leave me alone. 
[00:16:00]  Don't try to sell me something.  Yeah, that's awful.  You want to go parasailing in, like, something a guy made in his garage.  It's got duct tape on it.  He's hooking you up to the duct tape on.  She's got a perfectly brand new harness.  And yours has rat bites in it.  It's okay, man.  Don't worry, man.  They're zipping you out at 30 miles an hour.  You got to, like, buckle yourself into the thing.  But they help you broad to the point, like, hey, man, what are you doing to her? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, you know, you got to take your top off to get this on.  Is this too tight, man?  Let me help you.  Yeah, this is called an areola harness.  You're sitting there with the apparatus.  You don't even know which, you know, where your leg goes.  You got to figure the whole thing out.  And he's working it with your chick step by step.  It's on her perfectly.  And yours is all just, like, hanging loose.  You got an old World War II shoot that was used in, like, the Normandy invasion.  And you can't go anywhere on Sundays. 
[00:17:00]  I usually stay from, like, Sunday to Sunday.  I'll leave on a Sunday, get there late Sunday afternoon.  But Sunday is, like, the local day, like at the beach.  Yeah.  So you'll go to the beach, and there'll be all the locals.  And they have this little area that the hotels will give them with coral and sharp rocks.  You know what I mean?  And then, like, two feet over where the Wyndham is, it's all sand.  And they have little fun things to do.  Dude, you nailed it. 
[00:17:30]  We went to Atlantis down there in the Bahamas.  Thank you.  And as you're driving from the airport, all the locals are in the worst water possible.  Like you just said, coral, rock formations, awful waves that, like, are just crashing into the rocks.  And you get to the resort, and there's not a rock to be seen for the tourists.  There's the resort.  Everyone's like, woo!  Conga lining around the beach, drinking their mixed drinks. 
[00:18:00]  It's fantastic.  Everyone's having a great time.  Oh, they just got to hate the people that come down on vacation.  They look like, yeah, five feet over a barrier that they're not able to cross.  Me so on fire, feeling hot, hot, hot.  Yeah, hot, hot, hot.  Everyone's drinking, partying, topless chicks walking around.  Yeah, let's go snorkeling, honey.  And then, like, you move over five feet on the beach.  There's a civil war going on. 
[00:18:30]  Those are the kids.  Those are the nine-year-olds playing.  Those are people in army uniforms at eight, shooting at each other.  There's a civil war going on.  What was that?  Oh, I think it's the fireworks display.  Yeah!  Hey!  Keep going!  That's how you open up the coconuts, honey.  Hey, coconut drink over here, please.  Coconut drink.  What the hell is that sound? 
[00:19:00]  Is that machine gun?  No.  I think it's the golf cart.  Backfire.  That's what it is.  It's another round for my friends.  Yeah.  Hey, look.  We're bowling on the beach.  It's fantastic.  Because we're rich Americans.  Yeah.  We're Americans.  Bowling on the beach.  Look at this.  Just for me.  It's fantastic.  Hey, what's happening over there? 
[00:19:30]  What?  That's odd?  Does that mean it's noon and all banana daiquiris are free?  Yeah!  I think that's what it is.  Yeah.  We're feeling hot, hot, hot.  It is past the locals, and they're shooting at each other.  Stupid civil war.  And then you ask someone at the resort, and they're like, ah, don't worry about that, man.  No, no.  No worries, man.  Yeah.  It's all good, man. 
[00:20:00]  Just don't leave the compound.  Right.  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  You can't leave.  No.  Especially if you have a pink, all-you-can-eat lunch and dinner bracelet on, so you stick out  like a sore thumb.  Oh, please.  Forget about it.  If you're walking down the street, and you see those packs of wild dogs crossing the street,  and you're wearing your I'm with Club Med bracelet, oh, it's over.  It's just dogs, and they're all the same size.  I don't think it's like a baby dog.  It just comes out a grown adult. 
[00:20:30]  And they're just walking around, and they've got little bullet wounds.  Yeah, of course.  Like they survived the shooting.  It's just horrible.  When they have to drive you from the airport to the resort, you're just looking at these  places going, where's the resort?  Oh, please, where's the resort?  Pull me through these nice, beautiful gates.  You're just scared.  You're like white-knuckling it all the way to the resort, and all of a sudden, you see  the resort in the distance, and it's like, oh, it's sunnier over there. 
[00:21:00]  It's walking to the poppy field.  Right.  But on the way, man, you see the locals doing their laundry in the same water.  It must be this.  Yeah.  Just, it's the day out at the beach.  And they're drinking it.  They're getting their laundry done as they go swimming in the rocks and the coral.  They're going to climb back to the side of a wall, a coral wall.  It's got to be the same feeling that those poor soldiers in Somalia felt when they finally  got their Humvees out of the roads and hit that soccer stadium when they were finally 
[00:21:30]  at safety.  That's what it feels like when you're driving there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there's a war going on.  And the taxi driver will tell you that there's a war going on.  Yeah, they just turn up the reggae in the taxi a little louder.  It's like, don't worry, man.  You're almost there.  Oh, we'll be doing the electric slide any time. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, here we are at the resort.  Can I get your bags, man?  Yeah, thank you.  And we're all untrusting.  Remember when they came for our bags at the Club Med?  They just kind of rushed the van.  And I was looking around like, oh, my God, we're dead.  And they fling the doors open and grab your baggage and go, don't worry.  And they hand you a drink.  Yeah.  And go, your bags will be in the room.  That's the greatest setup ever.  You flew all night.  You show up at the resort at like 11 o'clock at night.  You're tired.  You drop your bags. 
[00:22:30]  And they're like, ah, don't worry about your bags.  And they hand you a drink.  They go, have fun by the pool.  We'll take care of everything.  Your bags will be in the room.  And I'm just picturing them rummaging through it.  This will be yours, man.  You take this.  You know what the worst is?  Is your girl.  She's so naive to the whole city.  As soon as I get off, as soon as I get there, I'm in James Bond mode.  I'm in like Secret Service special office.  I'm standing there.  I'm not smiling.  I'm standing up straighter. 
[00:23:00]  I pretend like I have a gun in my back.  Like I go outside and I keep touching the back.  So they think, what, he has something to keep touching the back.  He's got something in the back.  We need to check him out.  He might be special ops.  You know what I mean?  And then you walk out and you don't pick.  I pick my cab.  I don't pick the guy who comes up to me.  I go no to the first couple.  And I say it sternly.  And I look at no.  I said no.  And then I'll pick my cab guy.  Like he's my cue.  Like I'm waiting for this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  He's your cue.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, hello.  Hello, Bobby.  He's living a James Bond movie.  This car is equipped with oil flicks.  Smokescreen.  Right.  Thank you.  I start making like, you know, I start looking around as we're driving.  Like, you know, that over there, that must be, that must be where they make the oil for  the island.  That's the prison right there, you know.  Like I've been here nine times.  I've never been there before.  Like, yeah, you got to watch out on this aisle thing.  You know, things happen at night.  You got to be careful.  Like you know everything.  Can't we just have fun?  And what's your chick doing?  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With one boob hanging out.  Right.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  Well, you should know.  Can't we just go to that island that the guy said that they pick you up and everybody  goes to and it's a party all day and all night?  No.  Yeah.  You're not going to come back with your hair braided.  Yeah.  Here's the sound that's going in your girl's head.  This is all she's hearing.  Party time.  She's talking to all the guys.  So naive, too.  Like, did you meet that guy, Jack?  He is so nice. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, with the tear tattoo?  Is that Jack?  The tear tattoo and the eight pack.  Yeah.  That's cool.  All he has to do is work out.  The genetics these guys have.  He runs the trapeze over at Club Med.  And he's from France.  And he's just the nicest guy.  Is he?  Really?  The best was Ant's ex.  Did some parachuting there.  Did some sky.  She went skydiving.  Because she got talked into it by a hot dude. 
[00:25:00]  The next thing you know, Ant's wife is walking off with some hot dude to go skydiving.  So I'm locking the plane.  Yeah, trust me.  This is so long ago, Ant doesn't give a crap.  But at the time, he's like, what the heck is this?  I see the plane, like, spiraling upward, getting altitude.  And then I see a little dot, because it's tandem jumping, which is pretty much, you know, it's I'm taking you from behind skydiving.  She didn't have any harness.  She was held on by something else. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, no harness necessary, man.  Man, don't worry, man.  Yes, I won't lose you.  She'll be attached to me.  Don't worry.  That's right.  She was basically sitting on the guy's lap.  Yeah, that's how it is.  What was that about?  And I see this little dot.  Who would allow that?  Fall out of the plane.  I know why you allowed it, because you didn't care anymore.  At that point, I was hoping to not see a shoot.  She's got a G-string on.  Yeah, because they don't need to change.  You put jeans on.  No.  She put your bathing suit.  Yeah.  What is it, 15,000 feet? 
[00:26:00]  This was very hot in the plane.  You might want to shed your clothes.  This was Club Med skydiving.  You're right.  Everyone is in beach wear.  It's like, they don't tell you to go get a freaking jump.  You're not dressed like the 82nd Airborne.  Yeah, exactly.  Anytime you see skydiving, they're in suits.  They're in jumpsuits.  Except for your wife.  Oh, yeah.  She's in a G-string.  G-string with some guy strapped to her by Cialis.  And they just fly out of the plane.  I see this little dot plummeting until the shoot opens. 
[00:26:30]  And there was a little part of me.  I'm looking around the beach at all this hotness going,  how bad would it be if that canopy didn't pop?  How bad would it be?  Or it did just two seconds before the ground.  Yeah.  It said, thump.  Flood.  I actually took Viagra in, uh, you can buy that right over the counter down there.  I'm sure you can.  Hey, can we have-  All the employees probably have it all the time.  I popped it.  You popped it and we'll find out what happened after the break.  Oh, what a nice tease.  You're a C-tease.  I don't mean to, but we're a little late there, Bobby.  All right. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  Oh, man.  We love vacation stories.  They're all the words.  We should talk about the, uh, the Marine dude.  Oh, that guy in the boat.  We went on, all right, maybe after the break, went on a little snorkeling, uh, adventure.  With a Navy SEAL.  With a Navy SEAL.  Oh, a retired Navy SEAL guy.  Never look more ridiculous.  And all the girls on the boat were just like-  Swooning.  They couldn't help themselves.  This guy, all he does is take, uh, tours out on a snorkeling boat and goes to the gym 
[00:27:30]  in between trips.  Well, after the break, we got to talk about that.  All right.  We'll do that one.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.

[00:29:30]  I just came for the coffee.  I just came for the coffee.  I didn't.  Please, can you edit this segment?  I know we have ADD, but we'll get back to the Club Med story.  But yesterday on the show, Bob, we played a news story about a coffee shop, Coffee Nation,  I think it's called.  Yeah.  It's like a drive-through coffee, little joint, little shack, and the women are all in really 
[00:30:00]  small bikinis.  Slinky little bikinis.  And business is way up, and when they dress normally, they were getting maybe $25 a shift  in tips, and now they're getting upwards of $80 and more.  The tips have gone way up.  And they're interviewing all these guys, and most of the guys are pretty much admitting,  hey, if you're going to get your coffee, this is the way to get your coffee, right?  But one dope is like, I just come here for the coffee.  I just come for the coffee.  Because you know he'd go home and just get spanked.  Right.  You know if that makes the news, and the wife is watching, she'd be like, you went to that 
[00:30:30]  bikini?  Honey, I just came for the coffee.  I just came for the coffee.  He was so paranoid.  All the other guys are smiling like, yeah.  Yeah, it's a nice view when you get your cup of coffee.  Yeah, the girls, yeah, they're pretty, you know?  We go down there.  We got 30 guys down at the shop, and we go over here and get all the guys coffee at the  place with the girls and stuff.  And this guy was like, I come for the coffee.  Is that a TV camera?  No.  TV camera's rolling. 
[00:31:00]  I just come for the coffee.  I come for the coffee.  So what are you here for?  I came for the...  Oh, I'm in the coffee!  Oh, no!  What do you think?  It was Daylight?  Honey, honey, if you're watching, I'm sorry.  Yeah, Chris Hansen's going to come out of a donut.  Cup of coffee, yeah.  You're here for the coffee.  Yeah, but the guy's just trying to get a little peek.  He's probably miserable.  He turns the corner, and there's the TV crew interviewing.  I'll just come here for the coffee.  Oh, yeah.  Just drops his coffee, kicks the cup in the gutter. 
[00:31:30]  I'm just walking around the corner.  I hate coffee.  Anyway.  There's a topless donut shop in Maine.  Yeah, someone called yesterday.  We didn't get to them.  Dude, I used to...  There's a topless donut shop in Maine.  It's attached to a strip club.  You can go get donuts and coffee, and it's topless waitresses.  I don't get away with that with the Board of Health.  I mean, God bless them, but I would think...  It's Maine.  There's no Board of Health in Maine.  They keep the bottoms on it, and that's where the health issue comes in. 
[00:32:00]  They don't care about breasts.  It's what's going on underneath the bottom of the bikini that is a food issue.  Yeah.  Well, that'll be fair.  That's wonderful, Bob.  Geez.  Wow.  Can you not say breast?  Yeah, you can.  You can.  Just keep it at that.  Stop.  All right.  Okay.  Nice talking to you.  Nice talking to you.  But it's a topless donut shop.  Topless donut shop.  I don't like the combination food, nude broad that I don't know, like stripper broad, or 
[00:32:30]  a girl that would work in a topless donut shop.  I don't want her handling my food.  That's like at the strip club.  I used to go to a strip club after work when I was actually working for a living, and it  was a little place on Jericho Turnpike.  And I walk in there, and there's big heroes and buffets set out with, like, ziti.  And I'm sitting there, and I'm just, I'm paying, you know, seven bucks for a beer years ago.  And looking at these guys just loading up on food, and they're eating at the bar as the Long Island stripper, the day stripper, yeah, which is just the worst shift ever, is walking on the bar. 
[00:33:00]  And she's stepping over with the corns on her toes, stepping over your ziti, and they're just shoveling it into their mouths like, yeah, hot.  That's hot.  She has a cavewoman outfit on.  Yeah, a cavewoman.  Yeah, she has a plastic club and just a hairy, hairy bikini. 
[00:33:30]  You're sitting there shoveling ziti in your mouth as girls, girls, girls blast from the jukebox.  And then she pulls up a little covering on her breasts, and then goes, could you eject this, Bill?  Could you eject it?  I don't like this one.  You know, I...  Why do they have to cover up when they don't like the music, and they're waiting for the new song to start?  And then a new song will start, you know, Poison will come on, and they'll take the top back off and start dancing around your food again.  And then the jukebox slows down, and they cover up immediately. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, my God, did someone fix that?  Just hit, eject, and then she's got to...  She feels compelled to tell the guy in front of her wife she doesn't like this song.  This was me and a boyfriend that used to beat me, used to like this song, and it just reminds me of, yo, okay, back to work.  How's your rigatoni?  Yeah.  Is the ziti good?  Yeah, I wish I didn't make it in a cream sauce in this place.  It's cool.  I'd like to be able to see what's in here.  I'd cover my beard.  It's better than the red sauce, let's be honest. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, really.  Hey, um...  Frankly.  When I went down to Dallas with Jimmy...  You can think of that.  When I went down to Dallas with Jimmy, they took us to a strip club.  I think it's called The Lodge.  It was like a top-of-the-line steak place with naked broads.  No.  See, I won't eat in an establishment like that.  With animal heads on the walls and stuff.  And then they had a stage, and you had the big hunting chairs, and you're eating steak.  Like Commander McBrague.  Yeah, exactly.  There I was. 
[00:35:00]  Nude broads eating buffalo meat.  Dallas is insane, because you got that joint, and then everyone goes out.  And then after hours, I think there was a strip club.  Maybe someone could help me out in the Dallas area.  And their big theme was legs and eggs.  Because it was time to eat after the bars closed.  So, everyone went to the strip club that kind of surfed food, and their big promotion was legs and eggs.  My fear, my ultimate fear, would be eating some of the ziti, or one of those big 10-foot heroes that they would put out, 
[00:35:30]  and just getting where you're chewing, and they go,  and have to pick between your teeth and go,  and just pull out something curly.  Like, I just, that is one of the biggest fears of eating food.  Anywhere, right.  Anywhere, you're right.  Anywhere.  But in that establishment, it's just too free-flowing.  It's in the air like pollen. 
[00:36:00]  I don't need it landing on my food.  Legs and eggs just come up with, like, a thing of egg whites and just throw it on a guy's face.  Raw egg whites.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Here's my legs.  Oh, boy.  There was a bunch of us, and one of the guys I was with, got to keep this a little vague,  he decided to make out with one of the strippers at the legs and eggs promotion.  Great.  And he comes back to the table to start eating his eggs, and he starts laughing uncontrollably.  And I'm like, what's up?  He's like, I just gave that girl strep throat. 
[00:36:30]  God only knows what she gave him, though.  Strep throat.  Stupid guy.  What a move, dude.  Just spreading strep throat among the stripper community.  But he passed on a viral disease in his amyotivine.  On purpose.  Gave the girl mono.  Something she's going to have to take penicillin for.  What an ass.  Everyone just hammered, and for some reason, the stripper liked one of the guys I was with, 
[00:37:00]  and they're off in the corner making out, and then he comes back.  Keep her strep throat.  Keep her strep throat.  That's so wrong.  I understand.  Anyway, Club Med.  All right.  So we go on a snorkeling trip.  We've told this story.  This is one of our classics.  We open up the ball for this one.  But it's just too, it completely fits the situation.  Bobby just got back from what, Aruba?  I was in actually, I was in Cabo, Dane. 
[00:37:30]  I was in Cabo and Aruba.  I was in Cabo.  Dane rented a mansion for four days.  Wow.  On the beach.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's like Aruba.  I don't mind because it's the ocean.  You can go in.  It's kind of windy, but it's a cool breeze.  So there's no waves, and it's 2% crime rate,  except if you're a white chick hanging out with local guys.  And Mexico, Cabo, it's like you see a Jeep drive by with cops with machine guns,  and then the waves will kill you because the waves come in eight foot high, 
[00:38:00]  and they break and just slam onto the ground, and then they go back out in the ocean.  You can get into the ocean.  The problem with those waves, they're eight foot high,  and they break like a foot off the beach.  Yeah, they break right at the – you can't even enter the ocean.  They have no cushion if you get hit with these things.  Yeah, it's like Armageddon at the end of Armageddon.  You know what happens if you do get past the breakers, the breakers like that, though?  Yeah, it sucks you out.  It's so deep.  The drop-off just goes down over your head.  When you're like – you walk out three feet, and you're over your head. 
[00:38:30]  You can't even sit there and enjoy the waves because you'll get sucked out.  All of a sudden, you look, and your feet – you're buried up to your knees in the sand  from the suction from the ocean.  It is kind of scary.  It was ridiculous.  All right, hold on.  We're all over the place.  Jeff in Boston.  Jeff, go ahead.  Hey, man, that topless donut shop is awesome up there in Portland.  Yeah?  Portland, Maine?  Yeah.  It's right off the exit eight if you guys are heading up there.  I've been to Maine once, and it was Sunday River where you have to go on a local road 
[00:39:00]  for over 100 miles to get to the sea resort.  I don't like the idea of eating donuts from nude broads.  Why?  It kind of skeeves me out a little bit.  It's not the donuts you get to watch out for.  It's that glass of milk you asked for.  All right.  Get out of here.  That came out nice and smooth, didn't it?  Didn't it?  Nice delivery.  Hey, the guy had a great line.  All right.  So Club Med, they take your snorkeling.  You got to do all the staple things there, you know, and snorkeling is one of them. 
[00:39:30]  And so it's a boat filled with couples, and, you know, Ann and I, we're working our asses  off, we're as white as could be.  We look like veals.  We don't have time to work out.  I think my whole workout regime started after I got back from that Club Med trip because  I was like, no effing way am I going to deal with this ever again in my life.  Yeah, we do nothing but drink and then sit down and do our radio broadcast.  So we got beer bellies where as white as my t-shirt I have on today. 
[00:40:00]  I'm going to get some pictures of this, dude.  I'm really going to see what you look like before.  I got a few, yeah.  Like, you got pimples all over your body because you never take your shirt off.  It's just festering underneath your clothes.  Are you homeless?  And then you're taking your shirt off to go snorkeling, and you get on a boat, and I  swear to God, this guy was like an ex-Navy SEAL dude.  Yeah, Navy SEAL guy.  He decided, you know, it'd be fun to just bang broads, you know, at Club Med for the next decade.  He was the biggest show-off douche.  This guy would take you on the boat and give you a little lesson on the way, tell you what 
[00:40:30]  to expect, things like that.  And then on the deck, when you finally get to the location, the reef, he gives you the  hand signals on what to do if you're okay, if you're in trouble, you need help, just  everything.  And he's using these military signals, like the fist on the top of your head.  This will mean you are in trouble.  Don't wave your arms.  I will think you're just saying hello.  Like, really smart-ass drill sergeant kind of stuff. 
[00:41:00]  And it's a snorkeling trip.  But he's telling the guys that, and to the ladies, like, you got any trouble, you just  give me a look, and I'll make sure you're okay.  Our flippers, and then you put your mask on, and everything smushes in your face.  And you put the snorkel in, and your lips fog out, and you can't walk or see right,  because your mask is fogged up, because you don't know how to clear it right.  And this guy, at one point, and I'm not kidding you, this happened.  At one point, in the middle of talking, he goes, one minute, puts a knife in his mouth, 
[00:41:30]  jumps overboard, jumps overboard.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  please, please, I know you'll do the story justice.  But before that, he has to take his tight surfing shirt off.  Oh, yeah.  You know, the shirt that the guys wear at the beach, if they have a good body,  and he just slowly takes it off in front of the girls, and they're all like,  Oh, the girls just freak.  All you see is, like, abs, abs, abs, abs, pecs. 
[00:42:00]  You're just seeing muscle groups.  So he gets up on top.  There should be a doctor with a stick pointing at the muscles,  because it's a perfect example of what a guy should look like.  And we're just slobby, like, at the back of the mountain.  And we're all fat.  You've got hair on your nipples.  Yeah, you're just looking at each other going,  Oh, we're disgusting.  So he takes off his surfing shirt, and the girls,  every girl on the boat loses a little bit.  And then he puts...  He's got the wetsuit shorts on.  Right. 
[00:42:30]  And nothing else.  Wetsuit shorts.  He doesn't have flippers on.  He doesn't have anything.  And he goes...  He takes the knife.  Sorry.  And he gives us all instruction beforehand, too.  He's telling the guys, and addressing the guys just in nasty tone.  And he's like,  Do not touch any of the life forms you will see down there.  They're protected, blah, blah, blah.  And then out of nowhere, he goes,  One minute.  Puts a knife in his mouth.  Does a perfect dive overboard.  You barely see a blip in the water.  The guy's...  And then he disappeared. 
[00:43:00]  He went underwater and disappeared.  So we're just standing there like,  What the hell is going on?  And he pops up with a huge starfish in his hand.  Here are some of the life forms you will see down there.  After he tells us not to touch any.  Those are stocked, too.  It's probably dead.  Yeah, yeah.  It has Welcome to Mexico on the back of it.  It's a Disney prop.  It's animatronics.  Yeah, but right after he said,  Don't touch the wildlife,  He comes up with this huge starfish.  Starfish with a knife.  That he dove without a snorkel or a mask or anything. 
[00:43:30]  He didn't need anything.  Just showing off.  What was the knife?  Just in case he encountered something he had to kill with his bear.  With a parrotfish?  I have a parrotfish.  And then he's kind of flexing while everyone's snorkeling  and putting on suntan lotion.  Oh, yeah.  All of a sudden, your chick's not with you anymore.  You're like, What the?  They're all just staring back at the boat  as you're looking at the fishes.  Yeah.  They're supposed to be your buddies, you know?  Everyone dives with a buddy.  Me and Opie were buddies.  Yeah, absolutely.  The chicks were on this guy like,  You know those pilot fish that follow sharks? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  That's what they were like on this guy.  Dude, I could...  Just following him.  I could add to the story, too.  This goes back to 97?  Yeah.  Probably 10 years ago.  Nine years ago.  And I knew my relationship at the time was,  you know, we were definitely in trouble  and unfortunately it took way too many years  to finally acknowledge that.  Yeah.  Because I'm the biggest idiot in the world.  But I've never told this part of the story, by the way.  So we're at Club Med and it's like,  like we were joking to start the show, 
[00:44:30]  you want to stay near your girl as long as you can  because you just don't trust anyone at a resort atmosphere,  especially Club Med.  I finally had it.  I'm like, I gotta go to bed.  It was like 2 in the morning, whatever.  And I go back to my room and I just crash.  And she's out there with your ex.  Yep.  Next thing you know, it's like 4.30 in the morning,  5 in the morning, and I hear giggling and like talking.  And I'm like, what is this?  I stagger out of bed.  I open the door.  And there's my chick at the time flirting with the trapeze guy 
[00:45:00]  that walked her home.  The trapeze guy.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  And that trapeze guy was on her the entire trip.  Yeah.  And Opie's whole vacation, well, it was a working vacation,  but the whole time was spent like watching the goddamn trapeze guy.  Yeah.  Who, by the way, is another ass because they're flipping around these trapeze things.  Like, he's a pro because he is.  He's doing the somersaults and grabbing the other trapeze,  his legs doing back and forth to the arms,  and then whoosh, back up on the platform. 
[00:45:30]  Ta-da.  That's some fat Dutch lady.  Can't make it across.  No, me.  Oh, you couldn't?  And then I got to let's say, oh, try the trapeze.  Try the trapeze so you look more ridiculous than another guy here.  It's the whole trick to all those guys there is to come up with their specialties,  whether it's the snorkeling guy or the trapeze guy or whatever other things are going on,  dancing, whatever.  So you look 80 times worse doing it.  So your chick goes, I am with such a loser.  That's a real guy.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  I'm with such a loser.  What's your email address?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, it was exchanged at the time.  Was it?  The trapeze guy.  She got his email.  Let me ask you a question.  What was that excuse?  Because this is the thing is that my girl sometimes gets very –  they act so naive.  Like, why would he want to do anything?  Honey, I'm with you.  I'm with you, and that's all that matters.  Does it?  No, because I do esthetician work.  I work in a salon, and his sister worked in a salon before. 
[00:46:30]  I bet she did.  And she was trying to get back into it again,  and she lives in Chicago and might come to New York next week on maybe Monday,  but might not.  And he just wanted to email me to see if maybe I can –  Yeah.  What?  And you're sitting there like, how stupid do you think I am?  And how stupid are you to believe that?  There was the giggling at the door at 5 in the morning,  and who knows what was going on now.  It's like, excuse me?  Who knows?  They're all drunken. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Who knows?  Who knows?  There should be no giggling in your room with your chick at 4 in the morning.  No, outside the door.  Outside the door while I was sleeping, and that's what woke me up.  I'm like, what is this?  I came back to the room hours ago.  You open up the door, and there they are standing there with a guy.  Yeah.  A guy, you know, trapeze guy.  Trapeze guy.  How funny could a guy be with an accent?  A French accent.  You know something?  Yeah.  The chicks, they were digging him.  Well, she likes Clouseau, the Pink Panther movies.  Yeah, well, this guy was no Clouseau.  Ant and I were doing our own thing. 
[00:47:30]  It was so obvious.  We're like, at least we got our radio show.  Exactly.  Guys can really shut it down quick, though.  We found out that girl might be cheating, and we get mad for a second,  and then we go, eh, whatever.  At least I don't have to go with her.  Screw it.  At least I don't have to entertain her.  We were too busy trying to figure out our radio show and make this as big as possible.  And now, you know, it's got to be said, now I've got a well-balanced life, and I'm beyond happy.  But at the time, it was just like, ah, whatever.  Go flirt with the trapeze guy.  Who cares?  Do whatever you want. 
[00:48:00]  Trapeze guy.  So I hit the trapeze.  The trapeze guy, though.  I hit the trapeze, and he looks perfect doing it.  That tours the world freaking doing trapeze.  Cirque du Soleil.  He looks perfect.  Like a rock star.  He looks perfect doing it.  He has five brothers that look exactly like him.  So I've got to step up there and do the trapeze.  And this first thing I do is supposed to be, like, hold on with my legs.  And I do that.  You can't do that.  I'm wearing the shorts, and just my junk falls out the side. 
[00:48:30]  Like, I'm just, I'm hanging there all pasty.  I can't make the trapeze move, so I've just got to fall into the net.  You have your jockstrap on.  Oh, I didn't.  No, it's just junk is falling out because I'm upside down.  Bubble gums.  Oh, yeah, just Turkish taffies.  He's swinging haphazardly a few times with this look of, help me.  And then I've got to fall in the net.  He's got to tell me how to fall so I don't break my neck.  And then next up is Ant's accent.  And, you know, it's like, well, let me show you. 
[00:49:00]  I'll walk up this tiny ladder with you.  Yeah.  Oh, just some mess.  Sit on the top of my head.  I'll push you up.  Exactly.  Don't go to those places.  Jesus.  All right.  Watch him like a hawk.  Bob Kelly's here.  He's playing comics tonight in New York City.  Yeah, comics tonight.  C-O-M-I-X.  The address for comics?  The address is 353 West 14th Street, 212-524-2500.  Bob Kelly is hilarious, and he's also going to be part of the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour that we're getting very excited about. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  We're going to get into some other things.  Things.  Things.  I'm trying to – I guess we did Navy SEAL guy justice.  Yeah.  He was – there's no doing him justice, by the way.  He was just all man and made every guy on that boat look like a piece of crap wimp.  I went snorkeling.  You can get the fish food, and it comes in a package, and it's round and long.  Let's just put it that way.  It's around maybe 10 inches long, and it's round, and it's around like an inch or maybe an inch and a half circle. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, sure.  And I put it in my shorts.  Right.  And I just walked around the beach with wet shorts on.  With the fish food.  With the fish food in my shorts.  Dude.  And nobody said anything, but the women – can I tell you the reaction from – all the women would be talking, and then they'd be looking.  They kept looking like, oh, my God.  Of course you're a freak.  Dude, I got –  I came out of the water, and I fed the fish, and there was nothing. 
[00:50:30]  Lindsay and I went to Atlantis down there in the Bahamas.  I've been there.  You liked that?  We loved it there, the man-made lagoon where you could just do a little snorkeling, right?  Did you do that?  Yeah, inside before you get to the real beach.  Yeah, I know where it is.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a man-made lagoon, and it's cool to just kill an hour while you're laying on the man-made beach instead of the real beach, which is behind you.  Right.  I liked it a lot, actually, and we liked it a lot.  And so we're just snorkeling around the man-made lagoon.  No big deal, but just having a good time. 
[00:51:00]  And they have these little yellow bastards, fish.  They're probably – what is that?  Inch and a half?  Yeah.  Inch and a half tops, and these bastards will attack you.  I'm getting attacked by a school of tiny little yellow fish.  Isn't that frightening?  Just nipping at you.  When you're in the water, though, they look like they're eight feet long.  Yeah, you look at them to the mask.  And you look, and it's like an inch.  It's a guppy, and you're swimming away like it's a shark.  Just about every fish is scared of you.  They will not – they're not going to go after you.  They're not going to be aggressive. 
[00:51:30]  Even sharks, for the most part, will go the other way if they see you.  But these little yellow bastards would not leave me alone, just pecking, pecking, pecking.  And I got out of the lagoon like I had chicken pox.  They bit you?  Yes, they were biting me.  That's great.  Just little nips, just enough to be hilarious if somebody dropped in a couple piranha.  Just one of the locals threw in a couple baby piranha just to mess with somebody.  I don't know what it was, but I would love to know what fish was just bothering the hell out of me. 
[00:52:00]  And I couldn't get away from them.  They kept following me and just like this, just nipping at me and biting me.  And she was going, relax, it's just a fish.  And the fish only attacked me for some reason.  They weren't attacking her.  I just want to look at the fish.  I don't want them coming really close to me, but it's their turf.  You do this thing where you go down and you jump.  It's a scooter.  And you put the thing over your head and they give you fish food and you shake it.  Oh, I've seen that death trap.  Yeah, like a billion.  It's like a moped, like 20 feet down.  Yeah.  But they give you a bucket full of dog food, which is a fish food, and you shake it. 
[00:52:30]  But they don't tell you that these confident fish with good personalities and high self-esteem  come out of, like a million of them just surround you.  Dude, because they've been training the fish that they know inside their little tiny fish  brain at two o'clock every afternoon, the don't be fat tourists are coming along to feed  them.  Come with the dog food.  And they tell their friends.  Yeah, and it's all, you're like, wow, oh my God, please, no, just don't. 
[00:53:00]  You're feeling very close to your phone.  You shake it as fast as you can to get all this stupid food out.  Dumb fish will get away from you.

Shrek 3 getting only 45% good reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  Is that franchise done?  They're trying to say it's the best Shrek yet, but now that a lot of the reviewers have  seen the movie, they're like, 45% good ratings. 
[00:54:00]  We go to RottenTomatoes for our movie reviews, Bob.  Because what they do is they take all the reviews from all the major papers and sources and then  give you one basic review.  What's up?  I don't know.  They were doing the beach story on the news and they were just showing girls adjusting  their bikinis, rubbing on some sunblock.  Yeah, look at that fatty.  It's the beach footage.  You see the fatty with the teaback?  Yeah.  I love when the beach is open and the news is down there and they get the first real nice 
[00:54:30]  day and they send the camera crews down and they just show the hottest chicks ever on  the beach.  And then somebody's got to walk in front of the camera to just ruin the image.  What's a teaback?  A teabag.  A teabag.  Hey, chicks wearing teabags.  You know, the thong, but...  It's a thong.  It's just another name for a thong.  Because the back is just a T. 
[00:55:00]  That blee.  That blee.  Hey, really fast.  So, after the show yesterday, and I ran to a diner.  Yes.  I think we can say that.  We bolted.  We ran to a diner.  We're like the Beatles on a hard day's night.  We just ran to the diner.  We found a new way to our favorite diner.  Yeah, we were hungry.  So, we're just hanging out, eating at a diner.  And then I get the bright idea. 
[00:55:30]  I go, hey, why don't we go check out WNEW, our old haunt.  Our old haunt.  Yeah.  And we haven't been back in the building since they told us never to come back.  What is it now, Fresh?  Huh?  It's now Fresh.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's where we did quite well until we blew up our careers.  And I met the new GM that runs the new station over there where we used to broadcast that.  And she said, come by anytime you want.  So, I go, hey, she told me that we could come by and check out the old joint. 
[00:56:00]  I guess they remodeled and it would be really cool to go into the studio where we did all  those great shows and stuff in our old office.  So, we're like, let's go check it out.  So, we go up there and we see the receptionist that we worked with for years.  And she was beyond cool to us, by the way.  Yeah.  But as soon as she saw it, she's like, uh-oh, I've got to cover up my blouse.  Yeah.  I've got to cover up my blouse.  Like, why are you saying that?  What do you think we are?  Why?  She's like, it's good to see you.  And then she goes, oh, but let me cover up my blouse. 
[00:56:30]  Like, we're going to stare at her or something.  And then every woman that was walking by, she's like, Opie and Anthony here, cover up  your blouse.  Cover up.  Cover up.  Like, what?  She was beyond paranoid that we were like, wanted to stare at her boobs or something.  It would be a great commercial for your radio show.  Yeah.  You're walking down the street and just women covering up.  Cover up.  Oh, oh, it's them.  Oh.  Is that true there, Iraq?  There's a bin of mail there for me still? 
[00:57:00]  About a month or so, I was up there and right near the receptionist in one of those U.S.  postal bins.  Yeah.  There was just a bunch of mail for Anthony.  There's a bunch of mail for Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Can you go get that?  Yeah.  We could do a whole show on that.  Oh, please get that.  That's mail that's been piling up for like five years.  For years.  Okay.  I'll see if we can get it.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  When I was going through the old divorce, when I left the house, I didn't have an address.  So, I had to use N.E.W. as my home address. 
[00:57:30]  So, I'd get everything sent to N.E.W.  My bills, everything.  And they weren't really the best at sorting out the mail over there, let's say.  The person that was in charge of the mail was, well, he was handicapable, let's say.  Aww.  Well, he was a very nice guy, but there was a problem with his ability to read.  I'm just, I'm being honest with you.  They had the guy. 
[00:58:00]  But they gave the job for some reason.  Yeah.  In their infinite wisdom over there.  Wait a minute.  It was a promotion, by the way.  Yeah.  Because he was on garbage detail.  He would just be the guy that walks around.  But this is how out of control the place was.  He was on garbage detail.  He did a great job with the garbage.  He did such a great job that he was emptying waste baskets about ten times a day.  You couldn't find one with more than three things in it.  Right.  He was fixated on garbage.  He would say that.  He goes, I got to get the garbage.  Got to get the garbage. 
[00:58:30]  Is he Christopher Walker?  Garbage, garbage.  Got to get the garbage.  We would be in our office and he would just be constantly in there emptying our pails.  It's like, didn't he just empty that?  It's like, just leave him alone.  And I think he would hear the noise of this from down the hall and come running.  Garbage?  Garbage?  Garbage.  You need the garbage.  Because I take out the garbage.  And I'm like, okay, you take out the garbage.  We understand.  And let's make it perfectly clear.  We were very, very, very cool to this guy.  He loved us.  Yeah, he was fine.  He was great.  Wait.  I know we're going off on many tangents and I got to just add this.  I got the bright idea. 
[00:59:00]  I'm like, you know, he really, really likes us a lot.  And I think it would be nice if I took him out to lunch.  Oh, you idiot.  Why would you do that?  And so I took him to the Brooklyn Diner for lunch.  I don't know.  I was feeling nice for once.  And I said, hey, why don't you come have lunch with me?  And he was so excited.  He told the whole office, Opie's taking me to lunch.  I'm going to lunch with Opie.  Half a bit of garbage.  Was he Gollum?  Well, he's a special kind of guy, let's just say. 
[00:59:30]  But this has to be said because it's very important to the story.  He was handy-capable, but he didn't look handy-capable.  No.  He didn't have a long tongue?  No, he was just a regular guy.  But he was handy-capable.  But if you saw him on the street, you would think,  nothing of it.  His eyes weren't too close to the guy.  And the only reason I'm saying this is because it's important to the story.  So I say, hey, you want to get some lunch?  And he was so excited, told the whole office as well.  So he looked regularly. 
[01:00:00]  His lips weren't chapped.  Just keep it at that.  Okay.  Yeah, he was...  If you walked up to him, you wouldn't think twice about asking him for directions.  That's how I judge people.  Okay.  Like, I wouldn't think twice about walking up to him and asking for directions  and thinking I'm going to get directions.  Right, okay.  And sometimes people throw you for a loop.  You go, excuse me, how do you get down to 43rd?  And then someone will go...  And you go, okay, thank you.  Thank you.  I'm moving on. 
[01:00:30]  I'll just ask somebody else.  Do you have any mud?  No, I have no mud.  I like mud.  Okay, get some mud.  I have to go.  Yeah.  I'm going to ask somebody else for directions.  Thank you.  I lived with six handicapable...  Is that how you say it?  Handy-capable?  Of course you do.  I lived with six of them, but a couple of them, I know what you're saying,  they look like just a grandfather or somebody's...  So I take them to the Brooklyn Diner for lunch, and then we'll get back to the mail story.  And I'm sitting there ordering whatever I was ordering, and I'm looking down at the menu, 
[01:01:00]  and I look up, because there's nothing happening across the table from me, and he's staring at every woman's boobs in the Brooklyn Diner.  Oh, right.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And they have no idea that he's handy-capable, and he is fixated on boobs.  I had no idea.  He just loved women's boobs.  And the waitress comes over, and I'm like, oh, great. 
[01:01:30]  She was well-endowed on top of it.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  He is just staring at her boobs uncomfortably and not ordering food, and I'm like, I'm having an anxiety attack.  You had to get the waitress from the Russ Meyer movie.  Right, right.  A buxotic waitress.  And every girl that walked by, and they're there on, you know, whatever dates or whatever, because it's a tourist place,  so they're with their dudes or whatever.  Two helpings of nutrition. 
[01:02:00]  A double dose.  And just every girl going by, he's just like, he's almost breaking his neck.  He's turning and looking at every girl's boobs in the joint, and I'm like, oh, my God.  I'm going to get killed.  At least be cool about it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to know when to take a peek, right?  But he made it so obvious, and the waitress is getting annoyed, and I'm like, what?  I didn't know what to do.  You know what it is?  This is that, and I didn't know this either.  When I moved in with the, I live with six, you know, whatever guys. 
[01:02:30]  Handicapped.  Handicapped, handicapped, or whatever you call them.  And I think they call them MR patients, right?  Yeah.  That's what they called them when I was there.  Oh.  And she told me, now, listen, their, you know, sexuality is the same as you, you know?  Better not be the same as you.  No, like, I thought that they didn't, you know, but they have the same sex drive as me.  Yeah, of course.  Like, I would bring girls over, and they would come up, and they would use their, you know, 
[01:03:00]  whatever, them being retarded, you know, like, as, like, hey.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah, he'd wink at me, too, like, what's up, man?  How you doing?  How you doing?  What's going on?  Was he playing it off?  Oh, yeah, I did.  He'd grab, hello, and they'd grab it.  She'd be like, okay, it's okay.  He can do it.  It's okay.  Like Nicholson in Cuckoo's Nest.  Just give me a nice wink.  What's up, Bob?  How you doing?  Getting back to Dan, so, yeah, I took him to lunch, and it was just, it was brutal. 
[01:03:30]  I never ate faster.  He was, barely, barely touched his food.  I'm like, ah, just, ah, just take it to go.  Go, go get it to go.  And then I finally breathed when we got out of there.  I'm like, oh, my God, I had no idea.  But anyway, so he was in charge of garbage detail.  Al Dukes, who's the dump guy down the hall, he's reminding us, he goes, he once threw Scott  Farrell's birthday cake in the garbage before they even cut it.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was so fixated on throwing things out. 
[01:04:00]  And emptying garbage pails.  Yeah.  That things got thrown out before we could even use it.  He would throw away everything.  His parents kept trying to do to him.  Well, they were just trying to.  One of the, another great bit, another great thing that he did was they had a bunch of TVs  that were coming up to give away.  One of the stations was going to give away.  And they brought up the freight elevator and it was his responsibility to go downstairs  to the freight elevator and bring these upstairs.  Right.  By the time he got downstairs and upstairs, like three guys had talked him out of three 
[01:04:30]  televisions.  They were like, hey, what are those?  Oh, TV sets.  Oh, yeah.  Could I have one?  Yeah, the prizes.  Sure, have one.  And he gave away three TVs on the elevator.  Why, when you got hired again, did you not find him and bring him back as a producer?  I believe that he finally retired and they had a nice little send-off for the guy.  Going away.  Honestly, we all protected the guy.  Oh, yeah.  It sounds like a blast.  We liked him a lot.  And so they wanted to give him more responsibility to make him feel good. 
[01:05:00]  Carol Miller was really cool.  She helped him.  She started helping him read to get him to read, but he didn't read very well at all.  Right.  And then they decided to get a guy that can't really read to deliver the mail for the station.  So she would practice reading with him with like Dr. Seuss books, like children's books.  So someone –  Dr. Seuss rhymes.  It's a little hard.  Someone decided that this was good enough to give him more responsibility, which was to sort the mail. 
[01:05:30]  So we had – you know, in business, a place of business, they got those little boxes on the wall made out of wood, the little shelves in cross sections.  And it's a little cubby that has your name tag on the bottom and everyone's mail goes in there.  It was like he just put an M80 in the mail bag, let it blow off, and whatever flew into those boxes, that was your mail.  Sometimes you wouldn't get it at all.  Sometimes you're getting other people's paychecks.  I remember going home, just grabbing it, putting it in my pocket, going home and going, oh, I have someone else's paycheck here. 
[01:06:00]  This is fantastic.  And this won't even get me lunch.  I just made $7.80 an hour.  This is fantastic.  I have the board ops frigging, you know, over the weekend guy.  I have his check, and he's probably got mine, and he's tying one on somewhere.  He just bought a plasma.  But they gave him the responsibility of delivering the mail, and all our mail was screwed up every day.  You would get mail for everybody else except yourself and your mailbox.  And the trouble was, back from what I was saying, I was going through the divorce to the Denver address, so I used that as my home address, and I had bills coming in. 
[01:06:30]  I was never so screwed and behind and just lost.  Just having, like, things shut off, and my credit cards getting, I had to pay late fees on them, because they would just disappear or end up in someone else's box.  I would just look and throw it away.  Just delivering the goddamn mail.  The mail.  I had to throw in the garbage.  No, no, mail, garbage, two different things. 
[01:07:00]  It's not the same job.  Remember the, what was it, the bike flags?  They were so proud that finally, because when me and Opie got the job there, we started getting a lot of press and publicity for the station.  So they decided, because a lot of camera crews were coming in, finally to put mic flags, you know, the things on the microphones that actually say the call letters of the station.  So to get those and put them on the microphones.  They show up in a big box.  He puts them, like we were playing mic flag hide and seek. 
[01:07:30]  Like, on purpose, he put these in a place no one would ever look.  They were in a mechanical closet, which is the closet that holds the air conditioning units, behind the air conditioning unit.  And just stay there for months and months until someone accidentally found them.  And we would ask them, like, did the mic flags come in?  Oh, no.  No.  I don't know what mic flag, garbage.  Sounds like a fraggle.  Oh, dude, we, uh, it's got to be said, it's time to write our book. 
[01:08:00]  It's, it's time.  Oh, absolutely.  It is time, because.  The behind-the-scenes stuff that happened at all these stations is just ridiculous.  It's just amazing.  A lot of, a lot of funny stuff.  Was this guy an old guy or a young guy?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was, he wasn't a kid, that's for sure.  He's probably in his early 50s.  Yeah, would you put him that old?  By the time he retired, probably, yeah.  So maybe, ah, maybe mid to late 40s when we were there, I guess.  I got a pension, throw it in the garbage.  He, he moved to Florida and he's, and he's, and he's happy. 
[01:08:30]  To this day, I do that at home, too.  Me and my chick, like, if I'm, I'm, I'm, open up the garbage thing and I have to take  it out of the pail, I go, garbage!  It's just, it's a catchphrase.  Just think Rain Man, but it's, it's all about garbage.  Yeah, all about garbage.  That's, that's exactly what was going on.  No Wapner, no, uh, Kmart, none of that, it's all just garbage.  And I guess all the people took him to lunch around the joint, and I, I figured, ah, all  right, I took everyone else to lunch here, all right, let's go to lunch. 
[01:09:00]  Did you go by yourself, just you and him?  Yeah.  Yeah, just downstairs.  It's like a date.  But you know what?  All the salespeople really took him under their wings and, and really took care of him and,  and just, uh, treat him like a superstar.  Superstar.  That's what his, uh, nickname was.  Call him Superstar.  And he would tell everyone, I'm Superstar.  I don't want to say his real name, but yeah.  Superstar and then his name.  Superstar has to take garbage.  Right.  Go sick.  Go there, Superstar.  Put a bag in that one, please.  And all the salespeople, the general manager, they all came up to me like, hey, uh, a superstar 
[01:09:30]  is telling everyone you're taking him to lunch today.  I think that's really nice and all.  I'm like, yeah, you know, whatever, you know?  And, but none of, none of them would get, would let me know that he's fixated with boobs  and would just openly stare.  Like, why don't you give me that little, little knowledge?  Cause maybe I could get a booth in the corner facing a window or something.  Yeah, there's time and a place for that.  Did you have a booth in the kitchen facing the grill?  Yeah, he was a red man.  He was a rain man into garbage and, and God bless him, boobs. 
[01:10:00]  Boobs.  All about the boobs.  So anyway, we would try to go to the old joint yesterday, but the lady I know wasn't there,  so we didn't want to really push it.  But, uh, but this, uh, receptionist is just telling all the women, cover up your blouses.  Opie and Anthony are here.  And then some girl came up from downstairs.  Yeah.  And, um, she looked at us and just kind of started laughing.  Yeah.  I went, what are you laughing at?  And she's laughing hard.  She goes, nothing, nothing.  And just keeps walking.  And keeps walking. 
[01:10:30]  This is our lives.  This is our lives.  I don't know.  You know, we're characters.  What am I going to say?  People just look at us and laugh at us.  Yeah.  Openly.  That makes me feel good about myself.  Exactly.  We can just be pointed at and laughed at.  Yeah.  Like, jesters.  Me and you, I'm, I, Anthony would be like, yeah, what are you going to do?  People laugh.  I go, what are you laughing at?  I'll punch you in the face.  I just, I just.  Did somebody say something in Elevator before you came down here?  Just laugh.  Have a good goddamn laugh. 
[01:11:00]  I wish I had your attitude.  Yeah, well.  I'm going to wind up stabbing somebody in the heart because they laughed at me.  I just got done listening to your CD as they're pulling a pencil out of their heart.  Wait a minute.  I'm supposed to laugh at this.  All right.  We, uh.  Hey, let's.  Had our little trip down memory lane.  That was fun.  Don't forget about the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Bob Kelly in studio.  He's one of the many comedians helping us out.  And we can't wait.  The next date is June 16th.  Who's on that one? 
[01:11:30]  At Jones Beach.  Uh, Jones Beach, June 16th.  And we're really extra excited about this.  I'll tell you why.  Because Anthony and I are from Long Island.  Everyone knows that.  And, um, we love our Long Island roots.  And we haven't done a gig on Long Island in a really, really long time.  Uh, that lineup, Bob, is, uh, yourself, Bob Saget, Frank Caliendo, Jim Norton, Louis C.K.,  Otto and George, Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, and Stephen Lynch.  Nice.  Tickets going faster.  Ticketmaster.com.  And you can get all the info on, uh, what website there, E-Rock? 
[01:12:00]  MySpace.com slash VirusTour.  VirusTour on MySpace.  Um, you can get, uh, you can get all the dates, all the lineups.  E-Rock.  And all the ticket info.  MySpace.com slash VirusTour.  To find out, uh, if we're coming to your city or not.  You know what's, uh, doing really well, too?  Washington, D.C.  The ticket sales for Washington, D.C.  Very impressive.  Actually beating out a few places, uh, like beating out, uh, Camden.  Wow.  Yeah.  Who saw that coming?  But Washington, D.C. 
[01:12:30]  Very excited that we're bringing the tour there.  Jones Beach is like 87,000 people, right?  No, it's a big...  162,000 it holds.  162,000?  Yeah.  It's a big venue.  I think it's like 19, 20,000.  It could be...  I mean, it's...  I don't think we're going to get that high.  300,000 I think it holds.  300,000.  If you count all the people that could be in boats in the water.  Yeah.  So it's around 300,000 when we get the show?  Yeah, 300,000.  I think the people that rip off the concerts and take their boats behind, so they can kind  of listen and maybe watch a little from the side in their boat.  It's right on the water.  It's really cool.  We should get a paint gun for all those people. 
[01:13:00]  Lob a few shots over.  We should just stay in their boat.  Is that the date that Larry the Cable Guy is going to show up at?  Who knows?  We had Larry the Cable Guy sitting right on that couch, Bob.  And look at Bob's eyes got really big.  Yeah, Bob understands the power of Larry the Cable Guy.  He sells out arenas all over America.  You can go that way.  You can go the other way, too, but you can go that way.  You can go that way, you said.  What were you going to say?  You can say whatever you want.  I don't know.  Goddamn.  You just say what you're going to say.  Oh, okay.  You can go that way or... 
[01:13:30]  Larry said it.  He goes, if I'm close to one of these dates, I will do a set for free for you guys.  He said it.  That's basically a no.  Shh.  We're trying to help out tickets.  Oh, sure.  He's showing up?  That's great.  I heard Foxworthy's coming with him, though.  Rumor has Larry the Cable Guy said he would do a set for us.  Really?  Because we've been very good to him over the years.  Well, dude, he does make around $40,000 a night, so we're not stopping now.  I heard it's way more than that. 
[01:14:00]  It's like $300,000, right?  I heard like $200.  $700 million?  Something like that.  $200.  $200, I heard.  $200 million?  All right, let's go.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Larry the Cable Guy.  Woo!  Oh, Dane Cook's stopping by, too.  Bob Kelly told us before the show today.  What?  He's going by?  No, do one of our dates.  It's the Anthony Anthony Show on 92.3 Pre-FM.  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Anthony. 
[01:14:30]  Hey.  Bob Kelly's here today.  What's up, man?  Helping out with the show.  Where are you going to be, Bob?  I'm going to be at Comics tonight.  The new comedy club.  And it's such a beautiful...  This is the comedy club where Billy Burr got a donut thrown at him.  Really?  If you haven't seen the video, please go to Billy Burr's MySpace.  Wait, there's video of this?  They serve donut holes at this place.  It's a very fancy, it's a very nice comedy club.  And they serve sugared donut holes.  That's kind of nice.  With three dipping sauces. 
[01:15:00]  Chocolate raspberry and vanilla-ia.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that is a dumb thing to serve at a comedy club.  Something so throwable.  Looks like you tried them all there, Bob.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, you can't help yourself.  You're fat.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That was funny.  Sorry.  That was funny.  All right.  Like a wafer-thin mint.  Dance Friday on the Channel 11 News. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, well, they...  Dance Friday.  They do a thing, I guess, and what's her name?  The traffic girl, the hottie...  Jill Nicholing.  Jill was just dancing.  Really dancing her ass off there.  Well, yeah.  Didn't look too shabby.  Do you dance?  Never.  Do you dance, Opie?  I slow dance once at a wedding.  That's what I do.  Me, my girl, we'll do a little slow dance, sit back down, and then everyone could go F because I'm not going to get up.  I'm not doing the conga line.  I'm not doing the chicken dance, the electric slide. 
[01:16:00]  I'm not doing the New York, New York kick line.  None of that garbage.  And I'm not doing the stupid fast dancing thing.  B-52s comes on rock lobster.  You don't hit the ground.  No, I don't hit the ground.  Slow dance.  That's it.  One slow dance, sit back down, and drink.  I used to dance at a...  I don't dance anymore, but when I first got sober around 23 years ago. 
[01:16:30]  She's that long.  I know, right?  What is wrong with you guys?  We hang out with guys.  All the comics.  We hang out with comics that got sober at 17 and 18 years old.  They all couldn't take their booze.  I got sober at...  I was just getting started at that point.  15?  Here's another one like Jimmy.  Yeah.  I was in and out of juvie halls from 13 to 15, and then I got sober.  I went into a...  For a year, I had to go to this house with 25 other kids and a gay priest.  How did you...  Here's the problem. 
[01:17:00]  That's why you stayed sober.  You know what pissed me off about this guy?  He was like, hey, how are you?  My name is Father Gary, and nobody said anything about this guy.  Nobody said, are you gay?  Well, it was back in the day.  Yeah, back in the day, I guess.  But yeah.  All I'm saying is, at 15...  Yeah, how do you know, right?  How do you know you have a drinking problem?  Because every kid that drinks, because I know I drank back then, is like, if you would  have been in your 30s and gotten like that, you'd have to go to rehab. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  But you're a kid, so it's kind of expected that if you're drinking as a kid, you're going  to get that effed up.  So you're saying if you're drinking every day, using drugs every day, and robbing,  so as a kid, it's okay because you're a kid?  Okay.  Perhaps I've underestimated you.  And I'm robbery, assault and battery, malicious destruction, trespassing, break of probation.  I was a kid.  All right.  Okay.  See?  Now, I just consider it as you just get...  You drink a lot as a kid, and you pass out in the bathroom or something like that. 
[01:18:00]  I could drink a case of beer by the time I was 12, by myself.  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much.  And there was a reason you had to, isn't there?  Yeah, there was.  Yeah.  Oh, poor Bobby.  My second stepdad used to punch me in the face.  Did he?  I went to school with a nice black eye.  Oh.  Yeah, the nun was like, what are you crying for?  Oh.  Did you have to make an excuse?  I hit myself with that door.  No.  I said he punched me.  Oh, you just fessed right up to it?  And nothing happened.  Nothing happened.  Nothing happened.  No reports made. 
[01:18:30]  No news reports.  No nothing.  Nobody came to my aid.  No.  There was no foundation for punch in the face, kids.  Now kids will rat their parents out for anything.  Wow.  If they yell at them too loud, they go, hey, I'll call.  I'll make the call.  You'll be in jail.  Some kids actually threaten their parents with that.  Yeah.  Yeah, back then, I got punched in the face, went to school, cried, and she told me that  I didn't wear my tie, so my row didn't get a star.  I'm not even kidding you.  I had no tie in my head. 
[01:19:00]  You were the private pile of your classroom.  So not only did I get punched in the face, I think it was fifth grade.  All my classmates hated me that day, too.  At least the row.  And you wonder why I eat and I'm fat.  But, yeah, dude.  Was it when I first got, what was it?  What were we talking about?  I don't know.  When you first got sober.  Yeah, but what were we-  Have a drink.  We'll figure it out.  Nice talking to you.  Give me the ball back.  We got audio here.  Are you done eating?  Yeah.  The chest pass to Opie. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, we had to wait for Opie to finish his vegetables.  Me and Anthony tried to bond here.  Dude, you know what?  I gave you a bounce pass there, and you're just like, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble,  dribble, dribble.  All the circles.  Don't know where to go.  Should I take a shot?  Should I pass it back to him?  He was doing good, and then he just lost the ball.  Because I don't know where we went.  We were talking about something.  And then you dribbled it off your foot and went out of bounds.  We go off.  Yeah, me and Anthony go off.  Yeah.  We're just a tangent.  Don't drag Anthony into your, I don't know what I'm doing with this story.  Wait a minute.  Don't drag me into it. 
[01:20:00]  It's not my show.  It was a one-sided conversation.  Bob was talking to himself.  You're acting like, I do this every day.  If anybody should take a blame, it should be Ant.  Take the hit, Ant.  I'm never blamed for anything.  That's right.  I know.  You're really.  Ant never does wrong on this show.  It's amazing.  Sure.  The popularity he has.  He's the only child on this show.  All right.  Here we go.  We got some fun audio.  That might add to some hilarity.  You have me getting punched in the enemy in fifth grade?  Yeah, that was good.  Oh, the video of Bobby.  Not Bobby. 
[01:20:30]  What am I saying?  I don't know.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr getting a donut thrown at him.  Oh, please go to that.  You know why somebody slowed it down?  Did the Dave Chappelle slowdown?  Yeah.  Which makes everything funny.  Oh, it makes everything.  And the donut hits his chit's up.  And the sugar just explodes like a grenade.  It looks like shrapnel just shooting off.  Did he piss someone off?  Or was it just the fact that?  I'm actually watching it.  It does look like he got shot because the powder just spreads across his chest, basically. 
[01:21:00]  Or his arm.  Whatever.  Yeah.  The side of his body.  It was a corporate.  Like, they invited this company down.  And Billy went out there doing his act.  And they didn't like him.  They said something.  So Billy went off on one of his tangents about, oh, really?  So this is what you dreamed of doing.  One day I'm going to have a cube.  I can't wait to have a stapler someday.  Just trashing not only the career, but the life choices.  And the guy, obviously, you see a donut flying through the air.  It just smashes something.  A little too close to hell. 
[01:21:30]  It's great.  We're watching it right now.  It's on Bill Burr's MySpace account.  Obviously, backslash Bill Burr.  You can actually go to myspace.com slash Robert Kelly live, too, to get to it.  No, you can't.  Oh, you're right.  He's not on my MySpace.  It's about Bill Burr right now.  Go to Bill Burr's MySpace, which is Bill Burr, one word.  And you can check out him getting hit by a donut in slow motion.  It's very, very funny.  Audio.  Anchorman.  We love when the news messes up.  Check this one out.  He'll be back.  Last night, round two.  I was around two o'clock in the morning, you see, Jay. 
[01:22:00]  Jesus.  I was flipping channel on ESPN2.  He had vintage McDonald's All-American High School Dunk Contest.  Wow.  What was it?  Mic'd?  I don't know, man.  Damn.  How does that happen?  The guy was doing his thing, and he let out a little gas.  You move like two inches away from the mic.  What?  You move two inches away from the mic, it sounds like this.  Yeah.  And then you've got to be on the mic, yet it's going a couple of feet.  Maybe that part of his body had something a little more interesting to say, knowing half 
[01:22:30]  these idiots on TV, they'll be back.  Last night, round two, I was around two o'clock in the morning, you see, Jay.  Jesus.  I was flipping channel on ESPN2.  He had vintage McDonald's All-American High School Dunk Contest.  There's nothing funnier, dude.  You can't beat a fart.  A fart trumps everything.  We said it years ago, fart equals funny.  Every time.  Especially when it's not expected, somewhere like that.  Every time.  The guy's just sitting there yapping about the news.  Yeah.  And lets one fly. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  It's a different instrument every time it happens.  You just don't know.  Is it going to be a piccolo?  Or a bassoon?  Is it going to be a trumpet?  Or a tuba?  What are you going to get?  Sometimes it's one of those dog whistles humans can't hear.  You ever do a triangle?  It's just really dry.  You have change in your back pocket?  Ting.  I had a dream the other night. 
[01:23:30]  My whole dream over and over again.  You know, you have those dreams that just over and over again, you can't get out of them.  It's a cycle.  The dream was that I was farting and it smelled really bad.  And that was my dream all night long.  And then I was just horrifying people all around me.  And I just was praying that the farting would stop.  So I would stop freaking horrifying people.  This is what I was dreaming this week.  Most people dream of tidal waves. 
[01:24:00]  I know.  Or running away from a monster all night long.  Mine is...  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Mine was that I had uncontrollable farts that smelled really bad.  And I was annoying everybody.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  The war in Iraq does not seem to be letting up at all.  Excuse me.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[01:24:30]  There's President Bush giving an address to the nation today on the State of the Union.  He should be talking about tax cuts and other...  Excuse me.  Social Security is a giant issue on the agenda of the upcoming presidential...  Where people vote.  Where's the music? 
[01:25:00]  We need the music.  Gotta love that one.  It's killing me here.  There you go.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Let's just end from 1010 Winds.  Or excuse me, NBC Nightly News.  Why did I go to Winds?  Wait a minute.  I know why.  I gotta push the bad thoughts out.  NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw. 
[01:25:30]  President Bush under fire for his Iraq policy.  Policy.  It seems that Congress will not give him the funds.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Tom.  Oh, yes.  Politicians reach a deal on immigration overhaul.  This is a very sensitive issue to the American people. 
[01:26:00]  People who aren't supposed to be here.  Elite immigration.  Seems to be a giant issue on...  Wardrobe?  Could we get wardrobe down here to fix something?  No, I don't need hair and makeup.  I need a wardrobe.  What about the eight-year-old girl that found marijuana in her Happy Meal there, Tom?  Unbelievable story of an eight-year-old girl who found marijuana in her pot in her Happy Meal. 
[01:26:30]  And we'll take you now...  No, you don't want to come in here.  Please stay away.  I thought I could do a one-cheek sneak.  Didn't quite work.  Let me...  You don't want to use this chair.  Does someone have some...  A breeze for my chair?  What about the cabbies?  They want to build a gym at JFK to use while they wait for rides. 
[01:27:00]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  You know, cab drivers in New York City actually want a gymnasium built at JFK Airport so they  can work out when they...  Something tells me it could smell a lot like this studio.  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Why is the cameraman fleeing? 
[01:27:30]  Why is the teleprompter froze?  What about the...  Herpes might protect you from the bubonic plague there, Tom.  What is this, the 1400s?  Herpes could be a protection from the bubonic...  Plag...  Plag...  The bubon...  The rat disease.  Pardon.  Excuse.  Sorry.  Pardon me.  Sorry.  Excuse me. 
[01:28:00]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I must have had venison in pork and bean sauce last night.  Excuse me.  And...  Thank you.  Venison in pork and bean sauce.  You know that can't be good.  I hit game.  Game food is never good. 
[01:28:30]  You never want to hear this.  After someone...  Oh, it must have been the squirrel.  It must have been the jackrabbit.  It must have been the ostrich.  It must have been the ostrich.  That freshwater eel I caught.  He'll be back.  Last night, round two, I was...  Around two o'clock in the morning, you see, G.  Jesus.  I was flipping channel on ESPN2.  He had 50 new dollars.  All-American high school dunk content.  I like how he just... 
[01:29:00]  Jesus.  He just does it.  I guess that's...  Yeah.  That's up there on YouTube somewhere.  Farting reporter, maybe.  Yeah.  It's on our website.  All right.  You just lose every bit of professionalism.  I'm like, everyone just loses it.  You're not professional anymore.  Does he lean?  You have to...  Because you can't...  Yeah, it's very hard.  It all depends on the chair.  You have to move a little bit.  If it's one of those old-style plastic chairs, you don't have a chance in hell.  You're going to have to make the move.  It's a nice snappy.  It's a nice cushy chair.  You're playing a snare drum. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  It is a slow news day, by the way.  Yes.  Did you see the video?  Man, I think we've got to start doing kind of a TV slash radio show.  Yeah?  So we could play the video?  Yeah, so we could play the video and comment on it as it's happening.  I think that would be very, very cool.  But slow news day, I think you'll see this video sometime today.  They have video of a turtle, a snapping turtle. 
[01:30:00]  This is the huge story of the day.  This is like the big story, the big get.  A turtle chases a bunch of cats and bites them and will not stop chasing them.  And its mouth is open the whole time.  And it just, it's the fastest turtle I've ever seen, too.  Just annoying the hell out of this cat and will not leave the cat alone.  Just keeps following it, chasing it, and biting this cat.  A couple of different cats.  And the cat is trying to attack it, but it's a turtle.  Yeah, a cat can't really do much damage to a turtle.  Can't really get his paws around the thing or his teeth into the turtle. 
[01:30:30]  Pulls into that shell, does the turtle rope-a-dope, just sits there.  Right, does the rope-a-dope, and then the cat gives up.  And pops his head out and bites his tail.  Yeah, then the cat gives up, and then the turtle chases it again.  I've never seen a turtle chase anything.  I know.  Oh, it's hilarious.  The turtles just sit there.  I don't know if the news story's going to do it justice, but the video's very funny.  I think they were trying to have a little fun with the story on the news.  Of course they were.  And failed miserably.  In today's Animal Watch. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, jeez.  What is she doing?  I didn't see that coming.  Hey, I think you just made it funny.  Hold on a minute.  By the way, this show is unscripted.  We need to let people know.  So they tell us.  Unscripted, have no idea what we're doing on a daily basis.  Sometimes it works.  Sometimes it doesn't.  It's trying to make people laugh.  You know, 11-year-old Seth has a story.  See?  We didn't have Seth planning our call today.  Whoa.  And I don't think he's going to call because... 
[01:31:30]  Why is that?  Because I can't get him.  What happened?  Use the thing.  I'm using the thing.  But use the thing.  I got the thing.  All right, try it over here.  Hey.  Seth, New York, what's up?  Hey.  Seth, you've called before, right?  Yeah, I...  Wait, wait, wait.  Who's Seth again?  Give me a little background.  Seth, you're...  I'm the one that Opie said he would take me to the Islanders game.  Yeah, you were going to take little Seth to the Islanders game.  Yeah.  Seth, you're just one in the long line of young boys that Opie has promised to take to the 
[01:32:00]  hockey game and just left disappointed.  I kind of figured that.  You know, I used to be...  Opie's like Gary Glitter without the ambition.  Hey, man.  A little known fact about me.  I used to do a lot of stuff for Big Brother, so...  Did you?  Well, is it called the Big Brother program, right?  Yeah, one of those things.  Yeah, you help out the little fellas.  Help them out a little bit because they have miserable lives at home.  I worked with the Fresh Air Fund. 
[01:32:30]  Did you really?  Yeah, I locked all the other people's doors in the neighborhood.  All right, Seth, what's up?  So, one time I was in third grade and the teachers were talking, like, to the class.  And then out of nowhere I farted.  It wasn't just like a little fart.  It was one that was really, really loud and really, really stinky.  Yeah.  And it sounded like a tuba. 
[01:33:00]  And when I mean a tuba, I mean a tuba.  Yeah.  Like, ah!  Like, or a whale.  Yeah.  Maybe.  But...  A whale.  And then, like, me and my friend Jigmeat were there and were right next to each other,  trying our hardest not to laugh.  Yeah.  And then I broke out laughing hysterically.  God damn.  You gotta watch your mouth, you little potty mouth. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, listen, you little bastard.  You little potty mouth.  Keep it clean for everybody.  You almost wet your pants.  You were laughing so hard.  Just put it that way.  Yeah.  You little potty mouth.  You sound like a sailor.  Listen to nothing funnier than kid stories.  Yeah.  All right, Seth.  Hey, just blurt them out.  So then what happened?  So, and then I went to lunch and my best friend, Vincent, told me he heard the fart from next 
[01:34:00]  door.  From another classroom?  English, heard it in math.  He was right next to us and I was like, that doesn't make sense.  And he was like, I smelled it too.  And I was like, that's nasty.  Are you now known as like the kid that did that in class?  I've been known since like kindergarten or so as the farter.  You're not shy, right?  You're just one of those kids that's not shy about it. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, no, not really.  And last year, my teacher, my teacher said, okay, she said, oh yeah, and this year I  actually cleared a room out.  I was pretty proud of that.  This kid's destined.  Nice, Seth.  All right, Seth, we got to let you go.  You're hilarious.  What are you doing this weekend?  Anything good?  Lactose intolerant.  You going to go see Shrek 3?  A little milk carton.  Actually, I'm seeing that tonight, man. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, you are?  Shrek 3, right?  That's a cool thing to do if you're 11.  Who are you going with?  A chick?  No, unfortunately not.  No?  Who are you going with?  Mommy?  No, a friend.  A friend.  Oh, just one of your guy friends.  You're going to go stag and pick up a chick there, right?  Probably.  Yeah, I hear you.  All right, Seth.  All right.  Thank you.  See you later, Opie.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony, yeah.  Call us soon, Seth.  We love when you call the show.  He's trying to get in game favor with you, so you take him to the goddamn hockey game like  you promised children and never do. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  Promise children.  I don't like that sentence.  He does.  He promises children.  That sentence is just creepy.  I promise children.  There's a kid out there who's probably 25 years old now that is just still disappointed.  Never went to the Islander game.  Bunch of kids with sad faces.  Little Gary.  And Ranger shirts.  It was little 12-year-old Gary.  Gary?  Who's Gary?  Little 12-year-old Gary years ago.  It was another kid.  Opie said, I'll take you to the game.  And then he kept calling back.  He goes, Opie, when are you taking me to the game?  He got all sarcastic because he knew it just wasn't happening.  Like the kid, $2. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  $2.  $2.  A hockey game.  Years went by, and now he has a deep voice.  He still calls.  When are you taking me to the game?  Opie, you promised me I was supposed to go to the game.  Let's say hi to Liam from Bayside.  Liam.  Girlfriend.  What's going on, boys?  What's up?  Not much.  Listen, I got a good fart story for you.  I was hoping you were a little kid.  No offense to you.  I hope you were a little...  Adults telling him it's funny.  Are you talking to him in a kid's voice?  Yeah.  No, go ahead, Liam.  Make it fast.  Back when I was in...  Thank you. 
[01:36:30]  Well, back when I was in high school, my social studies teacher was a giant butch, probably  about six foot, maybe 300 pounds.  Just disgusting.  What a mullet.  All boys, high school.  She turned around one day in middle social studies class and ripped one.  Sounded like you were pushing a heavy...  You guys do it all day long.  You got nervous, dude.  Yeah.  You got nervous.  First one of the day.  All right, you got nervous.  You had a teacher that farted.  Nah. 
[01:37:00]  Here's the turtle story before we go to break.  Turtle chases a bunch of cats and bites them.  In today's Animal Watch...  Thank you.  This is a classic tale of the tortoise and the hare.  Only this time, the hare is on a cat.  Check this out.  A man in South Africa taped this bizarre footage of a tortoise chasing a cat named Humphrey.  Now, you can see the reptile continually nips at the cat's fur and the feeling he can't seem to get away. 
[01:37:30]  The tortoise then goes after another cat.  Now, this all began when someone noticed cats in the neighborhood were actually very nervous.  Now, we know why.  Look at him.  I think he was a dog in his past life.  Or a mailman.  Like Cujo, revisited.  Look at him, look at him, look at him.  And he won't stop.  Look at him.  He's just going after everybody.  Wow.  He keeps going.  And he can't scratch him because he wouldn't feel it.  I know.  And we count on the news from these dummies. 
[01:38:00]  Love it.  They always do the same thing, though.  They always just ramble.  Just keep going until somebody please say something funny.  No one ever does.  And then they have to, well, let's just get back to him.  Well, let's go to Chip for the weather.  Hey, that was some turtle.  And we're going to have some rain tonight.  Maybe a dog.  My uncle had one one time.  Well, it's going to be raining cats and dogs later on.  I don't think, I don't know about turtles, though.  I don't think it rains turtles.  Is that funny? 
[01:38:30]  No.  Okay.  How about, there we go.  Yes.  Mike, can I just say something that my girl's not going to, she's probably going to hate me.  She, when we went away to Aruba, she got a little, you know, she got a little, you know,  she got a little, um...  Lippy?  No, not lips.  I smacked her in the cheek the first day there.  She got a little stomach pain.  I gave her the goon hand.  Listen.  Is this going to make us want to talk for another 20 minutes?  Because we do have to break.  It might.  Is it a good tease?  All right.  Let's tease that something happened.  Ah, we'll wait. 
[01:39:00]  We tease Viagra, we tease...  Yeah, we got them.  Stomach cramps.  Also, could someone get me Crane Wedgie, please?  Crane Wedgie, on the way, on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Who?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  On 92.3, 3FM.  Do it.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. 
[01:39:30]  Yesterday, I tried to say good morning to everybody.  Today, I want to thank every listener listening right now.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  This takes too long.  Over there.  What about her?  What?  But it takes too long.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  I'm starting.  It's impossible.  I'm only saying hi to the people or thanking the people in Maine,  and then I'm going to work my way down.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Northeast to the Southwest.  All right.  Mike in Queens says his story will have you in stitches. 
[01:40:00]  In stitches?  Mike?  Hello?  What's up, Mike?  What's going on, guys? How we doing?  Good. What's up?  Man, you know, those uncontrollable experiences that we had outside of the home,  you know, there's a thin line between comedy and tragedy, you know,  and the way things make you feel.  I'm a cop and I drive limos, and I had some people in a car.  They wanted to go out to eat.  We go to City Island.  They invite me to eat with them, and then we had to rush to a Yankee game. 
[01:40:30]  I had to drop them and leave a strip limousine on the Grand Concourse  and run into a McDonald's that all the bathrooms were closed to  because they had already cleaned them.  The other lady tells me, go ahead, you know what, you can use this one.  She gives me the ladies' room and tells me, yeah, but when you're done,  just lock the door because, you know, the bathrooms are closed for the night.  While I'm in there, I'm having one of those uncontrollable experiences.  It sounded like bombs dropping and things exploding,  and I hear the young lady telling someone else the same thing she told me. 
[01:41:00]  By the time I come out of the bathroom, there's an audience of maybe three firemen,  two cops, and five people with this look on their face like,  what the hell did you just do?  I looked at all of them, and I could just laugh hysterically and run out of McDonald's  and get back in my limbo and get the hell out of there.  Not quite in stitches, my friend.  She worked for the news.  Is that the warm-up story, like the featured act is now coming on? 
[01:41:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage right now, let's have a big hand  for Mike from Queens with the real story.  All right.  Well, thank you, Mike, in Queens.  We've got Bob Kelly in studio.  He's playing comics, C-O-M-I-X.  Lots of shows all weekend long.  What's the phone number for tickets there, Bobby?  The phone number for comics is 2-1-2-3-5-3.  Easy there.  Now, I just talked over the phone number, so now it's going to be not as fast as we were home.  2-1-2-5-2-4-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2. 
[01:42:00]  Tickets call Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Come down.  All right.  So what's the story?  You were on vacation with your girl.  We teased the fact that she was getting a little lippy before the break.  No, she was having a stomach problem.  Oh, that one.  Wait a minute.  Let's talk about the lippy part.  she uh you know i guess girls when they go away they get a little bound up you know i'm on the  road all the time so i'm like clockwork i have coffee i'm done i'm in the bathroom yeah some  people can't travel and then you know you get the water or something and it does screws you up 
[01:42:30]  so we're lying there three days in three days without without which is i think is is it's  almost a medical condition we're on the verge of so you know you can't we've been eating three  meals a day right you understand you just watch your your gut just go expanding yeah it's it's  like i see the food going in right you start you start thinking in your head like what come on  how much room is in there yeah it's like you know i know a stomach is the size of a fist 
[01:43:00]  inventory is coming in but product is not leaving the factory yeah exactly we had we had uh pasta one  night that that swells when it hits liquid yep she had uh she had some rice the other night  oh that yes pancakes i mean this stuff is all you know it's not like she's eating lettuce  and uh so it's three nights in i'm lying in bed and then it just it just happened  i know something no no no no no oh okay she she let one loose yeah but nothing no noise or anything 
[01:43:30]  it was you know just just happened just i heard almost like a ninja a ninja crossing yeah just  crossing the foot of the bed or something what was that yeah what was that you just go what was  that it's a ninja then you anybody there ninja what was that and then it just came it just came  like just a hurricane this smell let me tell you something i've done some atrocious i mean just 
[01:44:00]  oh my god yeah where it's funny but then there's a point where it's not funny i actually i get out of  the bed i went in the other room i almost called somebody in the states because i i had to i had to  yeah that's oh yeah i don't think that'll make it we're professional i think you were doing pretty  good up till then that didn't make it yeah yeah there's just something about that that people  don't well i thought i had to check i had to check and make sure everything was okay yeah i had to 
[01:44:30]  make sure that it was just what it was and not something extra we had to have like a serious  discussion no prizes were left behind no parting gifts yes i uh i had to i i had to uh actually have  a talk with her the next day like you need to go to the pharmacy and get i can't go to a doctor  i can't handle this i well you know i just i don't want to i have a i don't want to think  about this i don't want to have to you know it really is you know a double standard there are  double standards in relationships like you could get away with a fart guys could get away with a 
[01:45:00]  fart they're not happy about that but they could go about the relationship after that but if your  girl farts in front of you man man there's no turning back that's because we're done we do it  from the get-go you're done we do it from wear it off the bat hey what's up how you doing bob kelly nice  to meet you you know what i mean they're they're hiding they're going in the bathroom shutting the  door turning music on hiding it and you don't know it and then all of a sudden they spring it on you 
[01:45:30]  no it's funny but you had me at  no it's funny about anthony i've been around him for uh way too long but uh  many many years that's way too long i have i everyone has farted everyone that has been  associated with the show one time right except for and i uh and he will hold it in until he gets home  no i'm not really uh he will he will suffer instead of letting it go i'm not really a gaseous person 
[01:46:00]  but uh i don't like making a scene i don't like making a scene here in the studio like jimmy  he makes a scene we all do but some but other people also like you're a guy and you're like oh  this yeah and you got the pain and you're like you know what i just i just personally know how  disgusting it is when jimmy uh fires a salvo and uh i need the lysol and everything and then you're  just sitting there kind of going god that is just awful and i don't want people to think that 
[01:46:30]  of me yeah but listen first of all it's weird that you turn into a nine-year-old boy when we  talk about farts i'm whining something happened to you his uh his bathroom behavior is a bit bizarre  we might we we might do that day when you were uh when you were uh oh i was hung over and i was um  and we got we got him to puke by just saying god awful stuff they kept talking about food and  disgusting things and i was so hung over and really finally got it which was amazing because 
[01:47:00]  if you know anything about anthony he's a private person when it comes to all that stuff so we follow  him into the bathroom and now he's got to do something else while he's in there and he he can he  flushes as he's as he because i wanted to ruin it i didn't want anyone hearing the disgusting  noises he he flushes as he goes so let's say there's uh a bunch of movements in your symphony  yeah wow thank you wow he uh he will flush uh after every uh every i'll just keep flushing most 
[01:47:30]  people will just wait and then one big flush right not anthony i wish i could give this story more  justice but it's all you hear is a lot of flush you know what else i can't stand uh the  bloop the the bloop so right when you feel like the tether is ready to break that's what i'm saying  you go like um not when you're alone cover up the bloop yeah not when i'm alone i don't care if it 
[01:48:00]  sounds like uh the civil war the 1980s video game sound yeah bloop yeah hey we get to keep track of  our uh grandparents now for the families of alzheimer's patients it is a nightmare scenario  their loved one gets separated or lost ends up in a hospital with no way to tell doctors who they are  or what is wrong with them it happened to emerson moran's wife pat pat was not able to tell them 
[01:48:30]  where it hurt what was going on with her uh she couldn't give them information about her meds or  medical history that's why this alzheimer's center in florida is launching a trial program  to implant 200 patients with this tiny microchip it gets injected like having a shot of medicine in  the upper right arm area by the tricep the chip itself lies dormant there's no power source there's  no battery there's no energy so nothing's going on underneath the skin  and how do they find them uh well we're gonna find out it's like attached to a rope but it's like 
[01:49:00]  an easy pass for old people it also is uh has all their medical history in the chip does it keep  their bingo record all the essentials bingo record i won 75 games on a full board and i won a y board one  time i don't like the z boards the z boards are not my cup of tea y board is much better 
[01:49:30]  how do you make bingo funny we have to all right hold on let me get more here the chip has a 16 digit  identification number it can get scanned at a hospital and when the number is put into a database  it can provide crucial medical information having this type of uh id and having this type of technology  to get the kind of assistance that they need right away is life-saving because our patients are so 
[01:50:00]  fragile and vulnerable it is the same type of chip that has been implanted in pets to help identify  them when they are lost but critics argue that humans are not pets and privacy critics argue humans are  not pets did they argue that was there an argument with someone saying no humans are pets they made  it did they make it sound like somebody's arguing the point that humans are pets yeah dopes not pets 
[01:50:30]  and privacy groups staged a vigil outside the alzheimer's center to protest what they see as big  brother branding protest they forgot those things i have one of my dog i have brother branding this is a  very invasive procedure and unless someone can give full consent then it's really a violation of their body and  their bodily integrity well unless you're looking at the old slippery slope argument again this just seems to me to be a good 
[01:51:00]  idea for old alzheimer's people because it's not like they're secret agents it's not like they're um these citizens that  are gonna really have to worry about their privacy they're old people that are very vulnerable they get lost all the time why not do  something like this it's like a lojack for your uh grandpa i kind of got a little experience on this  um where i grew up in uh centerport there was an old age home uh about a mile from my house the old folks home  the old folks home and every once in a while one would get loose 
[01:51:30]  go on a tear huh one would get loose  and do the slipper shuffle down uh 25a  oh that you really can see i i can see where  like where they're not supposed to be somewhere and has taught me a lot over the years and like if  you give in to i guess uh the argument is if you give in to this and and say it's okay for alzheimer's 
[01:52:00]  people to have the chip in their arm then what then it's gonna be children then it's gonna be  teenagers then next thing you know it's all of us and do you really want convicts do you really  want the whole big brother thing happening but questionable uh but political views or but where  i grew up you know they would get loose every once in a while and just wander around and all you would  hear freaking you know horns and it was like it was like a game like oh my gosh you're gonna get  hit and then where am i where am i i don't know uh yes i know wait a minute i used to own this 
[01:52:30]  house i drove a truck once to the moon they would get loose and just start wandering around the  neighborhood and uh you know you have to lure them back with jello  too like jello but uh we had the old age home on speed dial basically ah there's another one  loose oh thank god where is she before anyone finds out and they would find they would they 
[01:53:00]  would send a truck and uh get her back to the old age home my grandmother used to work at one of  those places yeah yeah they all people smell the exact same it's like this certain musky i think  it's like babies though like babies smell the same then as you get older uh you kind of have your  different uh uh odors or fragrances or whatever and then as you get really old you kind of go back  to the baby phase where you kind of just have it's like powder and didn't somebody say it's actually 
[01:53:30]  dying flesh yeah who said that somebody said it was dying comic yeah no i i said that uh you know  old people have their they already started dying it's in the process parts of their bodies are dying  and that's all his baby powder and flesh dying but um here's the rest of the story emerson moran  says the protesters should butt out if it's your wife or if it's your mother uh you want that  information available to the right people now critics say that bracelets might be a better option but 
[01:54:00]  the problem with bracelets is patients can sometimes rip them off now this microchip which you can see is  only the size of a grain of rice clearly a patient can't rip that off they have no rice  i have no problem with that unless they're being chased by the government and they have to rip that  out so they don't get caught yeah so they save the planet that always happens you gotta take the knife  they want to put these in kids put it in a little piece of uh candy and feed it to a rat so it runs  around actually i was reading a story where uh they're they're they're putting some kind of chip into 
[01:54:30]  the kids sneakers oh yeah so it's in the sneakers already great so they could find the kids sneakers  now some weirdo is going to know to throw the kids shoes off well that's the problem the news  had to tell everyone that this is you know instead of keeping it on the qt it's a huge story on the  news yeah but and your dog has it yeah my dog if you scan if you one of the dogs the one i adopted  he doesn't have it but the the the uh the the one i bought has it if you scan his back if any vet if  he gets lost they scan it bing all the information comes up the only thing that sucks is that it's my 
[01:55:00]  information from california i never went back in and changed oh great they're gonna bring your dog  to california yeah it's me on on uh uh supulville boulevard they're gonna bring my silky terrier  and his chip in his back can we go old school here before the break yeah they call my name's bill  uh that is a classic let me think though we'll find out as we play it uh yeah thumbs up on they call 
[01:55:30]  my name's bill what what what happened hold on let me think let me think uh-oh i'm getting a  communique i vote no have a clean version no i know this that's not about that it's not about that  what's the date i vote no i'm trying to think what would be the problem i'll tell you during the  break what's going on we were just talking about a chip and a dog and you want yeah all right we'll 
[01:56:00]  figure it out after the break it's a it's a great little bit though i know they call my name's bill  wonderful he's lost and uh he calls for some help and yeah it's great oh my god wait a minute  all right we'll wait a minute it's opie and anthony it's the opie and anthony show on 92.3  oh it's the turtle story on the news again there it is bobby look at that turtle it doesn't even move 
[01:56:30]  fast for a turtle and look at him his mouth is open ah that is a mean angry turtle  i love it it's just a there is no news for these people today to report none i gotta do liquid  breakfasts for now on what like uh scotch oh man i it takes me all morning to eat scotch we have to 
[01:57:00]  eat like five minutes at a time if that four minutes at a time yeah we graze so we have to  poke our heads up all right hey by the way um i'm i'm hearing things i'm hearing things i'm hearing  things don't be an anthony by the way um i think i'm gonna have to buy a lot of beers at fh riley's  saturday i think uh some of the pests are getting together are they that's what i'm hearing yeah i'm not  trying to am i trying to promote maybe i am i don't know my brother's restaurant out there 
[01:57:30]  in huntington village 400 new york avenue well they're there all the time anyway i'll be there  this weekend buying a lot of beers a lot of beers for the gang  but i'm hearing things stop down and say hi here and there uh gonna do a little hang nice let off a  little steam our phone number 1-866-313-FREE uh a couple things before we move uh move out of here  for the weekend what are those buttons you push keep pushing oh it's an ocd thing nothing so there's 
[01:58:00]  the ocd button so it's nothing you're doing no i um i do a lot of things that keeps a rhythm going  for myself so pushing a lot of tapping a lot of i do this a lot with the chair and tap pens and just  like go like this and push off buttons i'm playing music i don't know those are off buttons  so they're already off and he just hits them sometimes it turns it on and off it just gets  my rhythm going for the show all right i didn't know it's weird i know i thought you kept having  to do that it makes me look like i'm really doing something important right i can't believe he knows 
[01:58:30]  when to push those every other second and what button to do no it's like flying a space shuttle  cd in his hand i don't even realize to do it anymore so it's funny when someone like uh points it out but  yeah i'll just kind of tap buttons that are already on that's i'm just tapping a button that's on right  that's it all right and somehow it gets my brain in in a rhythm so we could so i could you know  help with the show that's all right it works it works we all have our little foibles and quarts 
[01:59:00]  what i don't know they were just showing a bunch of kids on a couch one was picking his nose yeah  yeah hey we got uh some more audio keeping it light today it's friday it's a little skeevy getting  people ready for the weekend uh girl gets arrested and she wasn't happy about it  who would be does danny know about this video no oh no don't come on jesus then the music has to  play oh boy yeah dance dance danny's in studio i'm gonna see danny dance revolution is that how 
[01:59:30]  you find it on youtube yeah go to danny dance revolution you'll see danny doing his dance  dance revolution moves and i gotta say it's some of the best dance moves i've ever seen  now since travolta he's got wide hips that's why danny has birthing hips  i'm starting to think wow sam's doing the danny i'm starting to think that danny was supposed to  be a midget and he he just got by like he just got by right you're ready well there's a there's a 
[02:00:00]  picture that we uh have of danny's like in short shorts he's in like rich voss short shorts  no top on like carrying a pole or something what is that what what oh wait there you go let's get  it right here it wasn't short shorts i it was full-size jeans that i had rolled up to my ass  cheeks yeah he was just trying to have some difficult unlike rich voss who was trying to get a little  more uh a little more drugs from a a gay drug dealer so he wore short shorts one of the best stories 
[02:00:30]  we've ever heard bob uh look look look what danny did as a goof and in that picture he looks like  he could have possibly been a midget yeah why is that is this the way you're it looks like he is  is it the way your pose the way the photo was taken perfectly honest i think it i think it's just  that specific camera it was a cell phone camera the cuffed pants it's because he's wide he has these  wide bones his hips are wide his chest is short and wide he's got he's got a little muscular 
[02:01:00]  hard by this guy muscular legs but he's not considered really short that's the weird part  about it but his body has like a like it looks like he could have been all a little person in the  1920s he would have been like a regular sized man but in 2007 with a fedora on yeah we've all grown  yeah you know man in like his evolved inches getting taller and taller i think it's getting  to the point where like yeah back in the day a little person was like maybe 4 10 and under but 
[02:01:30]  now yes bob five feet five foot five and under is now considered a little person you're a midget  danny's a midget is it the leg the leg to torso ratio yeah something is that an issue it looks like  it in that picture but i think that might be because your pant legs are rolled up kind of fine he has  that little midget butt too a little that little uh did your mom drink a lot when uh she was  pregnant with you she had to have yeah yeah that's what i'm thinking fetal alcohol syndrome that's  what i'm thinking was going on yeah something's got to explain her psychosis yeah because midgets  are fat and like thin too like he has that like he has a little chunky no you know it is not fat it's 
[02:02:00]  my my dad has that awful stumpy you know body type where he's got like you know that long that  that thing you're just talking about the big torso stubby leg thing yeah yeah wide yeah you do  and you have that little that little slamming little midget booty i have i have a soft spot for  little people now because that that show uh little people big world you watch that one farm yeah he's  he's a classic pumpkin farm i would love to talk to this guy he has more confidence than anyone in 
[02:02:30]  in this room and he's a little guy and he's on crutches all the time so yeah but i love that his  his midget kid hates being a midget right he hates his parents for being midgets yeah have you  watched a little people big world no they they're ready to do another marathon you guys sit down and  watch it's the most amazing thing like they're uh they're little people that hate each other the  mom and the dad hate each other mom acts like a like a tall person yeah to the dad yeah yeah who's  a midget and he treats and he has more confidence than anyone in this room i mean he's ridiculous that 
[02:03:00]  the the what he's been able to accomplish in his life and he has uh four kids three kids how many  kids one a girl four kids four kids three of them are average size except for oh no and their son is  now 17 and he's pretty much six foot tall yeah he's he's pushing six and the father is like four  four i believe it's a 50 50 shot yeah well and and and to get three out of four and what makes him  the show amazing the 17 year old son that's uh pushing six foot his twin brother is a midget 
[02:03:30]  and hates being a midget not happy about it he hates it because his brother is getting all the  babes all the babes and he has to sit there like he's still kicking around his soccer ball kind of  goes to kick it and he rolls over it and then the two other kids are like quote normal size yeah  but the mother hates the father because the father comes up with these schemes all right and he  talks like vinnie brand all right i think i'm gonna uh i'm thinking of building a pirate ship 
[02:04:00]  back in the house and sell tickets and she's like he's an entrepreneur with his farm like he has like  an old western town with underground tunnels and and the funny thing is he uses his uh his um handicap  because he besides being uh a little person whatever he he can't really walk well he's got crutches and  stuff so he he bosses everyone else around he comes up with these ridiculous ideas for this huge farm  and then he tells his help like you know all right get the backhoe and he's just move it he's just a 
[02:04:30]  tyrant build me a trebuchet uh i want to uh throw a pumpkin a hundred yards and they do it and then  somebody actually got somebody got hit in the head with it the backfire some lady got smashed  poor people that have to build his own son and this guy uh mike that just lives on the farm because  he has no family or something i should have put him in the trebuchet trebuchet yeah but he's always  come up with ideas and like um his wife is very conservative and like uh stupid ideas she doesn't 
[02:05:00]  want to hear any of it she wants him to go to go to a nine to five job and bring home a nice paycheck  and he is like he's a free spirit he always has been like screw that i want to i want to do this i  want to do that he he has uh those uh zip lines all over his freaking farm that he they went on  vacation they did a zip line he thought oh my god i gotta make my own now it's back at the farm  hey mike build me a zip line i want to zip i want to go i don't want to take the car around the i want  to zip line from house to house yeah so he just goes on a zip line you can only go one way no he uses 
[02:05:30]  he uses uh actually it's a it's a green little truck that's his truck and it has like it's a mule  yeah it's a mule one of those things he tools around the farm uh in a mule the guy's hilarious  he rides his kids have no respect for him no that's not true they they do whatever they want  they're regular teenagers and they're you know they're kind of holding back like that look this  worked when you know we were the same height but i'm i'm a foot and a half taller than i'm nine and i 
[02:06:00]  can beat the crap right right right but the wife always just undercuts him really oh yeah she's just  she's a you know even though she's like you know a little person she's still just a regular wife  attitude yeah he he loves her to death and she couldn't be bothered really basically that sounds  like a sad show it's a it's a really good show but the dad's hands are regular yeah really doesn't  have like uh that that little hand but no and the big hands bigger than rich voss's hands and you want 
[02:06:30]  to hear the other yeah you want to hear the other drag uh about the show so you got the two twins  the one is regular size the other one is uh you know midget whatever and uh there's another brother  who's now what nine maybe and is already taller than the 17 year old and and wrestles him and beats  him up and oh that is not beats him up but beats him up like you would you know when brothers are  fooling around and and the kid has to just take the fact that his nine-year-old brother is stronger  than him and bigger than him already he just walks around the house like oh god does this suck he 
[02:07:00]  doesn't have that same free spirit like his like his dad does like his dad's like whatever i don't  care if i have one arm one leg yeah he just doesn't care it never affected his life but the son is  definitely like they tried to send the son to a midget dance well they have no they have uh  conventions little convention convention yeah little people conventions little people they and only like  a a real god-awful holiday inn in the middle of milwaukee will accept this convention it's like 
[02:07:30]  it's is there a sign on the outside just say welcome midgets or something or well little people  it's not it's not up on the building though it's actually on the front doors so they can see it  but uh how you doing yes but but the thing is is there's like hot midgets uh yeah well i've seen a  couple of uh midget women that um uh kind of hot that one from um from uh total recall wasn't that bad  yeah for a midget i mean for hey yeah without the makeup the eyeball and her forehead no not that 
[02:08:00]  one the little uh the midget one that picks up the machine gun yeah she had like she had like big  boobs for a midget well there's there's two different there's a there's little there's dwarf  and they can't they have to keep their wallets in the front pocket because they can't reach their  back well she's a dwarf she was a dwarf right she was a dwarf a midget is the same proportion  right as but midget is uh known as a derogatory term they're all under the umbrella of little 
[02:08:30]  people but it doesn't distinguish between dwarf and then what do you call the people that are all  under one umbrella used to be midgets yeah when it rains everything under one umbrella yeah really  fast tony along around tony what's up tony hey guys how you doing hey yeah uh great uh great show  that little people big world my wife watches it all the time and this guy comes up with those  crazy schemes but bob kelly man you nailed his voice you do him perfectly yeah i i i'm not gonna lie to 
[02:09:00]  you it was one of these shows uh i wanted to kind of point and laugh yeah and then i got hooked i'm  like oh he's there he's just a regular guy you're right you're right you know it kind of turned me  around a little bit and the guy is just like just so full of life he he bought himself a volkswagen  bug and he races it and stuff really oh yeah he just he just does what he's a free spirit and his  wife's like how stupid hobby he's got she's always putting dishes away he's just sitting there i'm 
[02:09:30]  checking over the budget and i think we can afford a roller coaster i think we can get a roller coaster  i mean we'll get more people in here with the pumpkin patch the pirate ship and the the trebuchet  pick your own to pick your own peaches yeah and now he's like he's in his mule and he's just a  dreamer and he's like looking at this field and he's like christmas trees remember christmas trees  so now and and it's not good enough because it's a flat area in on in his farm that's doing nothing 
[02:10:00]  he's like wait we're gonna plant i i you gotta do the voice we're gonna plant christmas trees  christmas everywhere but that's not good enough and trust me he could barely lift the hammer and he  can't he could he could like operate some of the heavy uh machinery order people around i gotta  i gotta tell you i mean he comes up with the ideas and then and then just bosses everyone else around  to get the ideas done he's like so the field wasn't good enough that it's flat and you could you know  find your own christmas tree right eventually he wanted to make the terrain rough so you really have 
[02:10:30]  a good time going up and down the hills trying to find your christmas tree what a dope i'm telling  this guy is he's he's crazy and the best part he doesn't finish any of his ideas and that's a  problem with the wife oh you know he's a dreamer she's like oh he's a dreamer never gets anything  accomplished he really is he has a half a pumpkin patch and she made him go back to his job i guess  he's like a software genius and uh but that's before the show got really big now it's ridiculous  everyone wants to go to this farm to pick their pumpkins and stuff because they've seen the show
