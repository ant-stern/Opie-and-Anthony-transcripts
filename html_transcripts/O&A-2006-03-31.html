<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "Cribs"-style segment focusing on listener Pat's extremely squalid trailer home.  On-site reporters Than, Dan, and Danny provided graphic descriptions of the filth, including cat urine, feces, and a generally appalling level of disorganization.  Pat's neighbor was interviewed by phone, sharing his own unfortunate circumstances.  The segment included explicit descriptions of Pat’s trailer, highlighting unusual features like a vice grip used as a water valve and the contents of Pat's book collection, including sexually explicit titles such as "Maximum Sex" and "Women's Best Kept Secrets," portions of which were read on air.  Listener Andrew, who has a speech impediment, called in and was invited to the studio, leading to humorous exchanges about his job driving a private cab in the Bronx. Several female listeners from a bikini bar also joined them in the studio.  Plans were made to film a longer "Cribs" feature on Pat’s trailer, and future show events, including a St. Patrick's Day egg-eating contest, were discussed.  Numerous calls interrupted the segment.

The show then transitioned to the "ultimate challenge" involving a phallic-shaped device and bees.  Sexually suggestive banter with female guests and discussion of a male guest's sexual encounter filled the air.  "Creepy bug guy" Ken from New Jersey provided insects like hissing cockroaches, mealworms, and honeybees, detailing his collecting methods and bee sting experiences.  A video showcasing Japanese hornets decimating a honeybee colony was shown.  The hosts' intern, Bill, modified the contraption for safety.  Callers offered suggestions and expressed concerns, while EMTs were on-site due to the inherent risks.  Numerous XM Satellite Radio promotional announcements, including NHL game coverage and World Cup updates, were interspersed with celebrity shout-outs.  The hosts briefly expressed anxieties about their employment situation at XM.

Next came "Super Ball," a testicular torture contest with participants Steve, Rafael, and Matt.  After brief discussions of baseball, sports movies, and a wine review, the focus shifted to Super Ball preparations, involving extensive paperwork and waivers to prevent lawsuits.  Contestants brought various items (vice grips, glue traps, rat traps), some deemed too dangerous and rejected.  The hosts’ humorous (and pained) reactions to miniature bear traps were detailed.  Safety protocols, including beekeeper suits and standby EMTs, were discussed. A caller called in sick to work to listen. A previous failed promotional attempt involving an Aztec was mentioned.  The various devices, including miniature bear traps, were demonstrated, showcasing the pain inflicted.  The final Super Ball challenges were finalized: mousetraps to the scrotum, waxing, Ben-Gay application, a freestyle round, and the ultimate challenge of placing bees in a container onto the scrotum.  Safety precautions were heavily discussed, including how bees were transferred. Comedian Tracy Morgan made a surprise appearance, wearing a beekeeper suit.

"Super Ball Thursday" detailed the competition's increasingly absurd challenges.  The first involved attaching mousetraps to scrotums.  Rafael (Connecticut) attached three, Steve (Connecticut) five, and Matt (New York City) six, despite a hand injury.  Tracy Morgan left. The second challenge, waxing, proved less eventful. The ultimate challenge, involving bees and genitals, saw varying reactions from contestants, with one container malfunctioning.  Contestants attempted to get stung by bees and wasps.  Ari from *Dog Sees God* and Fezz from *The Ron and Fez Show* were present.  Commercial breaks and XM Satellite Radio promotions were included.

The final segment showed a man, "Champ" or "Matt," participating in a stunt involving a jar of a wasp nest near his genitals, provoking the wasps. The segment ended abruptly as the show's time ran out, with Champ still holding the jar and the hosts rushing through closing announcements and plugs for XM Satellite Radio programming.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  I'm chilled, motherfucker.  Don't tell me to chill.  I've had it with some of you people.  Are we ready for Cribs?  Yes.  Does Big Racy Jen take her pants off, too?  Radio.  I haven't heard.  Oh, there she goes. 
[00:05:30]  Wow.  She's taking her pants off.  She's totally naked.  Wow.  Holy shit.  I'm unique in the world.  Wow.  Well, thank you, Big Racy Jen.  This pal talk is something.  You want to see new girls?  Boom.  There they are.  New girls.  It sure does take away from the radio program.  Wow.  She's completely taking her pants off now and everything.  She's not even...  It's a light radio.  She's totally naked.  You could probably pick up my reception if you tune into a...  Who's Pat talking to? 
[00:06:00]  Pat's talking to our guys, I guess.  Oh.  Pat, who are you talking to?  My neighbor.  He was wondering what's going on.  Why?  He sees cameras and stuff?  Yeah.  Probably thought it was a murder happened in there again.  He didn't realize he was living next to a celebrity?  No.  He does now.  Who, your neighbor, Pat?  Yeah.  Put him on the phone.  Okay.  Would you like to talk to Jim Norton?  He's a comedian. 
[00:06:30]  There you go.  You're known as my neighbor.  I'm his neighbor.  Oh, hi.  How are you, sir?  I'm fine.  How are you today?  Good.  Has, like...  Do you think that Megan's Law has affected Pat living there or not at all?  Megan's Law living here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they're going to have me evicted tomorrow.  You?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Sir, do you...  Look who's driving my truck.  You're Pat's neighbor, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what happened to you that you're living in a trailer too? 
[00:07:00]  That I'm living here?  Yeah.  Quote, marriage or divorce.  Oh, so you had a house?  Oh, yeah.  House, everything.  I had everything, you know.  You had a nice house and you were married.  And then you got divorced and is she now living in your nice house with another guy?  Thank you.  And you are living in a trailer on a slab next door to Pat from Munaki.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Way to phrase it. 
[00:07:30]  Some other guy is...  Isn't there a fickle finger of fate?  Yeah, that's it.  Some other guy is raising your kids?  No, no.  My kids are grown up.  Oh, okay.  So that's the only good side.  I got the dog out of the deal.  A dog?  So you got the dog and a trailer.  Is your trailer nicer than Pat's?  Oh, well, not yet.  But we're both working on it.  What's the main problem with Pat and his trailer?  The main problem with Pat and his trailer?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  There's no problem.  He's fine.  It's just we're, you know, we're just chilling down here. 
[00:08:00]  Actually, I met a very nice girl and she's got a really nice house and kids and all that  great stuff.  So it's not really that bad.  Yeah.  Tell yourself whatever you have to.  Hey, is Pat's trailer neat or messy?  It's neat.  I mean, you know, it's just what we...  All right.  We're bored with you.  Can you get Pat back on the phone?  Yeah.  Sure.  Sythetic life.  Wow.  Awful.  Jesus Christ.  Give us your whole life story.  That's a horrible story.  You're not getting me kicked out of the trailer park, are you?  Wow.  Who's that bum?  Thanks, Pat, for that wonderful conversation. 
[00:08:30]  That guy's got an awful story.  Yeah.  But at least he has a reason for living there.  All right.  Let's say...  I'm yelling.  Unlike Pat.  Let's say hi to Than.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Than.  We're currently in Pat's yard.  Yeah.  Yard, huh?  What does that entail?  It's the...  I'll get a copy.  I'll make a copy.  I'll put it on CD.  Between the two trailers.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Pat was yapping while you were saying that. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, Pat.  Don't yap.  For some reason, he was coming through louder than you were.  Stop telling that bum you're going to make a copy of his appearance.  They got the black white from my yard.  So you can play for a stupid family.  All right, Pat.  Hold on a sec, man.  Yeah, Pat.  Shut up.  I know you're excited, but it's not about you right now.  No.  That's not Pat.  Fucking Pat.  All right, Than.  Yes?  So we're in the muddy space between his trailer and the nice gentleman you just spoke to.  And that's the yard.  And that's the yard.  The muddy space.  What's in the yard?  Some features include a bike that has weeds growing through it. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, you need that.  Due to inactivity.  And then if we come around just the back, Pat was showing us earlier.  Pat, stop tripping over your bike and tell us what's going on here with his water heater.  There's a story there.  All right.  Go ahead, Pat.  Now you go.  Well, I had a water heater, and then I had some water damage, and what happened is my 
[00:10:00]  old water heater fell from the floor.  And then they replaced it with a new water heater, and they just put a couple wooden planks  down, and basically it's just perched there with air rushing around the water heater.  Like the stove over the tunnel in the Great Escape.  Yeah, there you go.  It's just kind of stuck there on the floor where a tunnel is underneath.  Just like you.  Now, you fell through your own trailer floor at once, didn't you? 
[00:10:30]  That is correct.  Yeah.  And the water heater fell through also.  So the old water heater that fell is in your yard?  No, that got thrown away.  Oh.  I got a new one.  Okay.  The flume isn't quite lined up correctly.  That's what helps me get to sleep at night.  But it gives me a little hard time getting up in the morning, though.  All right.  We're going to head into the...  Same carbon monoxide jokes he used last night.  All right.  Dan is moving into the trailer.  Dan, really fast.  What's your first impression of the whole thing as you made it to the... 
[00:11:00]  Have you pulled in?  Yeah.  Let's see.  A lot of inertia.  Like, Pat's not going anywhere.  That's sort of how I felt.  Inertia.  He is truly an object at rest.  A lot of inertia.  Oh, shit.  Well, I'm looking at Pat's cam.  He is now working his way toward the camera on the phone.  Yeah.  You are now inside the Munaki Manor. 
[00:11:30]  The first thing that strikes you is really the smell.  Yep.  Okay.  That's what we need.  A little more info for our senses.  Yeah.  What does it smell like in there?  It's pretty much one gigantic litter box.  Hmm.  Like...  Well, Pat has how many cats?  He has four cats, I believe.  Four cats.  So it's going to smell like cat piss and cat shit.  And a very sad dog, too.  Yeah.  Very sad.  Tootsie Roll, anyone? 
[00:12:00]  Tootsie Roll, anyone?  He's gesturing towards the litter box.  Offering Tootsie Rolls out of his litter box.  I see Danny's taking video.  He's got a million of them.  I see that on Kyle Talk.  Hey, Pat, this is quite a camera you have hooked up there.  Why don't you just take Polaroids and fax them?  It'll be fucking faster than the refresh on that hunk of shit you have.  Yeah, I know.  It's like a year old or so.  All right.  So...  From the old Apollo program.  So, Stan, the smell's awful. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And it really just...  I mean, some highlights include over in the kitchen, which all of his cutlery is just sitting in a pan on the stove.  All of his cutlery...  You mean like his fork, knife, and spoon...  Yeah.  ...is in a pan on the stove?  Yes.  All right.  That's his cutlery drawer.  Where the cats can go up to them and lick them and shit on them and do whatever they want.  Step on them with their shit-covered padded feet.  Little soft padded shitty feet. 
[00:13:00]  It looks like some of his clothes drawers are just cardboard boxes.  Uh-huh.  They're just sitting there open.  His wardrobe consists of a clothes rack in the middle of the kitchen.  Oh, my.  We got to fucking chip in and get some money together and buy Pat some cyanide.  Hey, you guys are going to do the real cribs where you interview him and have him take you on the tour?  Yeah, we'll do that. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, what's the posters there, Nathaniel, behind you?  Yeah, there's a poster I'm looking at behind you.  On that wall?  It's completely inappropriate.  I can see it.  Skull or something?  This one right here?  Yeah, those two posters.  We got an O&A one.  Uh-huh.  And then we got Albert Einstein and a...  Oh, and Alfred E. Newman?  Yes.  Yeah.  They're making the same face.  Right.  It's quite the juxtaposition.  Pat, where did you get that poster?  I think I got it down in Wildwood where I did my little salty ball contest. 
[00:14:00]  Wildwood.  Yeah, it had like a wrinkle in it, so they gave it to me for like five bucks.  Jersey's Disney.  Oh.  Danny just pointed out another neat feature about the kitchen.  And instead of a cold water knob, it's just a vice grip sitting on it.  Oh, that is great.  It doesn't work.  The vice grip to turn the water on and off with.  The big locking pliers.  Yeah.  That is fantastic.  And it doesn't work?  That is correct. 
[00:14:30]  Why is that?  Do you have no water?  It froze like last year, and then it just never came back on.  It's not...  And it can't be the ice because it went through the summer and it still didn't work.  Yeah, I would assume it can't be the ice if it went through the summer.  It's probably high cholesterol.  It must have been cold, cold ice.  What happened is it probably snapped.  You probably tried to turn it on when it was frozen and it snapped shut.  Why don't you get it...  So what do you do for cold water?  Well, the cold water works. 
[00:15:00]  The hot water...  All right.  Yeah.  What do you do for hot water?  I use cold water.  And for hot water, I use it for a shower, and then I have a sink in my bathroom that has hot water.  Yeah, but don't you have to ever wash a dish?  Well, I use cold water pretty much.  See, in order to wash dishes, you have to use pretty hot water. 
[00:15:30]  Well, like if I get stuck on stuff on my pan, which I eat out of, by the way.  I have a two-quart saucepan.  That's my plate.  Oh, so you don't have to put it in a plate.  You heat it up, and then you eat right out of the pan with your...  Yeah, and if there's some stuck-on mess, I put it on the stove with some cold water,  and the cold water magically becomes hot.  And then I just suds it all up, and it's all wonderful.  All right.  Well, I can't really...  Yeah, I had a room for rent once, and I used to cook Lipton soup in the coffee maker. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And drink it right out of that.  Ugh!  Yeah.  It's awful.  But there's a wilderness away.  It's called poverty.  Now, your shower does have hot water?  Yes, it does.  He's pacing back and forth.  Than, anything else in that trailer?  Um, there's some interesting book choices.  Okay.  Uh, I'm sure there's some irony here somewhere, like, uh, the book How to Make Money in Stock. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Living Online, um, Maximum Sex.  I'm mad about what?  Uh-huh.  The book says Maximum Sex.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was something my friend gave me.  Jesus.  Women's Best Kept Secrets.  Wow.  Yeah.  And the book he should have is How to Avoid Cat Shit When You're Tiptoeing to the Bathroom in the Dark.  Wait, uh, Women's Best Kept Secrets.  You gotta read a little passage from that.  All right.  If you can.  Pat, would you like Pat to read? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  All right.  Oh, it's from Stuffed.  Uh.  Give us one of the secrets there, Pat.  Hmm.  Then it won't be a secret anymore.  Never.  Never.  Ah, he is great.  Uh, we'll pick, uh, number five here.  All right.  When the time is right, grab her hair.  If she's lit enough, oh, if she's lit enough candles to light up California, and you've been 
[00:17:30]  looking sweetly into each other's eyes, looking sweetly into each other's eyes, and everything's  slow, slow, slow, slow, the time is not knee, nigh.  What?  Huh?  But every romantic interlude should end with a bang and a whimper.  So when she lets her hair down, take matters into your own hair, hands, and pull.  That doesn't make any sense to me either.  Is there a little secret in there?  Uh, what do you do when you pull off your sock and she screams, where is it, and runs 
[00:18:00]  for the door?  Throw the hatchet.  I got it for the pictures.  Huh?  I got it for the pictures.  Yeah.  Your friend gave it to me.  All right.  Uh, then anything else in there?  Uh, just the, the copy of the Atkins Essentials.  What?  The Atkins Essentials.  Is it the Atkins Diet?  Oh, the Atkins.  Oh, the Atkins.  Blow the dust off it and read something out of it.  And then I got, I mean, you'll have to see some of the film, but his bathroom almost defies 
[00:18:30]  description.  Almost.  Oh, so give it a whirl there, Dan.  I'll give it a whirl.  It's like somebody just started a bathroom and then kind of quit halfway through.  Now, uh, there is a toilet bowl.  There is a toilet.  It's on a, uh, jaunty angle.  It's running.  I better catch it.  Oh, the toilet's running. 
[00:19:00]  He better catch it.  Uh, now what, how big is it, would you say, the bathroom?  Um, I don't know.  Four feet by four feet.  Yeah, a little, very, little square bathroom.  A little more.  That's more than four feet.  That's like seven feet.  Oh, stop.  If that's what I'm not going to script here.  And then, uh, does it have a shower, a stand-up shower?  It has a bathtub. 
[00:19:30]  A bathtub.  Ooh, luxury.  Yeah.  A lot of people would have some sort of tile or some sort of finishing on the wall.  It just looks like, um, the outside, or like the inside of the trailer wall is pretty much what he showers in.  Like sheet rock?  Yeah, it's just a really thin, papery substance.  Yeah.  And is it mildewy because it's not the right...  Yeah, it's, uh, I believe substance is the word.  Does he have a medicine cabinet? 
[00:20:00]  No.  No.  It mirrors the look of my lovely body.  He has a pile of socks and underpants on the floor.  Oh, now that would be your laundry.  Yeah.  Now, Pat, what do you do to do your laundry?  How do you do your wash?  They have a laundry.  The old trailer park.  Turn it around.  You go to the trailer park laundromat? 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  And how often would you say you take your clothes down there?  Probably once a week.  Maybe once every two weeks.  All right.  Enough clothes for it.  Hey, fan.  I'll give you a shiny silver dollar if you get on your knees and put your face in that pile.  That's easy.  Okay.  I'll take that under consideration.  Any skid marks?  The other kind of neat feature is, oh, wait.  You know that all sinks have cabinets underneath, you know? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  His is boarded up, but you can sort of peek through and you can see right outside.  All right.  So it's a vanity, what they call it, a vanity, where you have your sink and underneath there's  a cabinet where you would keep your toilet paper, things like that.  His is boarded up like the sink cabinet has been condemned.  It's been boarded up, but you can look through the cracks and see outside.  Yep.  Now, what happened there, Pat? 
[00:21:30]  That's where the water heater fell through.  It connects right to my shower and to right under my vanity.  Oh, my God.  We've got to get you a real job.  One last detail about the bathroom is that the tub is exposed.  Like, there's no panel next to the tub either, so you can just sort of see what's going on  down there.  It's really nice.  Wait, I'm not getting you.  Like, you know, like the tub is obviously a little off the ground into the wall, and 
[00:22:00]  usually there's some sort of panel so that you can't see the actual bottom of the tub.  Pat doesn't have that.  Oh, it's like a, like you could see the, I kind of understand what he means.  The ball.  Usually it's built in.  Right.  Like a tub is built into something.  You could actually see the belly.  The belly of the tub because there's nothing around it.  Yeah, usually there's a facade.  No, or usually it's a new tub that that's part of the tub. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's, it's, what is it, got like four claw feet on it that it's sitting there on?  I have no idea what it's suspended on.  The floor just cracked, by the way.  Don't fall through there, guys.  I'm quite stepping over there.  And, and, and, uh, Danny also pointed out that instead of caulk around the top of the tub,  there's a whole lot of duct tape.  Jesus.  A lot of duct tape, uh, taking care of, uh, the, the trailer.  Pat, how long have you been in that trailer?  Uh, since, uh, like 93, I believe. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, my God.  That's just.  You've been in there 13 years.  Yes.  In the same trailer?  Uh, yes.  What did that trailer cost you 13 years ago?  I think, uh, my, uh, brother bought it to get me out of the nice house I was in.  Uh, I think he paid like $2,000 for it.  Two G's for that.  And it's depreciated.  Do you know that trailer is worth $8 right now? 
[00:23:30]  But you pay for the slab that it sits on.  Yeah.  So you have a monthly rent, and we figured that was.  Look at all the work I put into it.  Sweat equity.  Uh, we, we've tried to get a homeowner's loan, and I owe them money.  Now, how much do you pay to, uh, to have the slab?  Uh, I believe the, uh, base fee is like, uh, four, I don't know, $560 something.  And then I gotta pay, uh, like, $100 between, uh, PSC&G and, uh, kerosene. 
[00:24:00]  And propane.  Kerosene, propane.  It's like $700 in there.  $700.  Now, I'm thinking, I'm thinking, for $700, you could probably get something better.  You could rent somewhere.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't like animals.  I have my animals.  I must keep them.  A, kill them, or B, find a place.  Eat them.  Yeah, a lot of people don't like to look out their fucking sink and see the yard. 
[00:24:30]  I thought he was actually going to say, but I'm a homeowner.  Yeah, why don't you just find a place that's animal-friendly, Pat?  Well, yeah, that's a possibility.  Basement, apartment, a crazy cat lady's house or something?  An extra $100, that's $800 a month.  You could certainly find a nice one-bedroom apartment around there for that.  Yeah, maybe.  Definitely.  Dan, anything else?  Well, Pat also shared with us that his cat has a rare disease, feline leukemia. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  That is quite deadly to the cat.  That's death.  Apparently, it's contagious, so we can kiss them all goodbye pretty soon.  And this is where I fell through.  Oh, and he's highlighting the part where he stepped through his floor.  What is now covered with what?  Well, metal plates.  Metal plates.  Yes.  I cannot wait to see.  He's got a weight room?  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Once you bridge the gap to the back, you have a nice room with...  It's called a Smith machine?  Yeah.  It doesn't look like you've seen a whole lot of action.  Oh, I can't do that.  The weeds growing through it like the bicycle?  Yeah.  There's a permanent indentation where the barbell rests.  Hey, now.  That's very good.  Oh, well. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, Pat.  Yeah?  What about your prized possession?  What is it?  Yeah, what is the number one thing, your prized possession?  If your trailer burst into flames, aside from your beloved creatures...  You mean my fortune?  What would be the thing you would run in there to get and run out with?  Well, we've all had visitors.  Someone comes over your house.  You want to point out something, like, to brag a little bit.  Like, look what I got.  Like, what would you show people?  I guess my Nathan's Qualifier trophy.  Oh.  So, basically, what you're saying is if your thing caught fire, 
[00:26:30]  you'd actually find more of your possessions to throw into the trailer.  That's true.  I'm a little self-conscious here.  Just a tad.  Thad, anything else?  Just the fact that, I mean, we've clearly painted a decent picture here.  Yeah.  And then he has a flat-screen monitor for his computer.  Wow, that had to cost him a couple of bucks.  Yeah.  And XM2Go radio. 
[00:27:00]  Mm-hmm.  And, yeah, so his priorities seem pretty straight.  We also have a handsome picture of him back in his sporting days.  Oh, when he was a little thin?  Yeah.  He was a wrestler.  Oh, but I can.  Can you hold that up to the camera?  I'd love to see that.  Yeah, let's see that with the, um.  Yeah, he's moving the camera.  Oh, there it is.  All right, let's see.  All right, put it up there.  All right.  And you've got to hold it still so it doesn't digitize so much.  Get it on camera.  Yeah, don't move.  Don't.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at him.  Hold on.  Leave it there.  There's a young, uh, little young buck. 
[00:27:30]  Now he's moving it around going, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Action league now.  Wow.  Very nice.  You were, uh, you were trim.  Yep.  Yeah, I was even a champion.  You were?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're trying to get him to scan these things so we can post them up.  Yeah, you've got to scan them.  Now he looks like King Kong Bundy.  How old a pick, uh, how old a pick is that, Butterbean? 
[00:28:00]  Uh, I believe it was, uh, 1979, I believe.  How old a gentleman are you now, Pat?  I'm 42.  Okay.  There you go.  All right, well.  That is all high school days.  Well, Dan and Danny are going to, uh, you know, do a little Cribs thing with you.  We're going to throw the videos up on opiananthony.com.  Oh, and I'd like to show my family.  Yeah, that would be a good idea.  We'll make sure we FedEx it.  It's my sister Dawn and her boyfriend Patrick.  Uh, the gift that he got for Christmas because he has no family pictures. 
[00:28:30]  So my sister decided, as a Christmas gift, to give him a picture of her and her boyfriend  so it could be his family.  Jesus.  That's so sad.  How nice to be in the Kumia family and not see any of that money.  And no jiggly Italian cock.  All right, hold on.  What, you want one?  I guess Nate is looking at Pat on the webcam and has a question for Pat.  Nate from Brooklyn.  How you doing, guys?  I just wanted to know, does Brad Pitt ever come around to that house to give Pat a chemical 
[00:29:00]  burn?  Hey, you.  Hey, why, you.  All right.  Yeah, this.  All right.  Uh, does Danny have anything to add there, uh, Than?  Does he ever.  Any anything to add?  Uh, just the overall filth.  Just the overall filth is what is really taking Danny.  All right, they'll capture it and they'll do a whole Cribs segment.  Uh, Than?  Yes?  Fantastic job on, uh, Cribs. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, you.  Thank you.  Any, any final thoughts, Dan?  Um, I, while, really cherish my job with the show.  Oh.  He's kissing a little ass.  Not today, because I'm seeing what happens when things go horribly wrong.  Oh.  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks.  No, my sister isn't black.  I feel things are looking up.  I think it's just Pat's cam.  Yeah.  Pat's cam's got to turn the contrast up. 
[00:30:00]  No.  She is Italian, but no, she's not a black woman.  Er.  Well, you know, the Moors invaded Sicily.  You know, back when the Moors, Pat.  Great, great, great, great grandmother.  Well, any final thoughts there, Pat?  Uh, yeah.  I'm, uh, I'm like, uh, Ralph Prince, and I'm taking stock of myself, and big things are going to happen.  The marathon was on, and, uh, yeah, he's taking stock.  All right, Pat.  The applicant is a bum.  All right, Pat. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  Pat, your place looks like the Yucca Flats after the blast.  I have an atomic kitchen.  I had fun at dinner, but, uh, like Eminem says, oops, back to reality.  Yeah, that's what he sent.  They sent an email.  It said, oops, back to reality, and it was a picture of a Boston Market chicken in a plate of plastic plate with some potatoes. 
[00:31:00]  Your salary couldn't drip out, but your tub could, because there's a hole in the bathroom floor.  My memory.  My memory's just shattered.  All right.  I fell through the floor.  My foot hit Mrs. Manicotti.  What even hold?  I guess what he called me on the refrigerator.  Don't forget the $50 apartment.  A lot of questions and comments coming in.  Marty from the Bronx.  Marty?  Well, this guy needs a trailer makeover, man.  A trailer makeover.  A white trash trailer makeover. 
[00:31:30]  Yep.  Pimp my trailer.  Pimp my trailer.  If by pimp you mean take kerosene and a match to it, then pimp it by all means.  That really should be a fucking bonfire starter.  My healthy food?  All right, Pat.  We're going to go.  I have a girl in my fridge.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  What's in the fridge?  Boneless chicken breast.  Boneless chicken breast from Boston Market?  And the ice cream's behind it.  Wait, wait. 
[00:32:00]  You're in the freezer?  Yes.  Hold on.  All right.  I think Dan's back.  What's in the refrigerator portion of your ice box?  Oh, okay.  Dan, you're looking at the refrigerator?  Yeah.  For some reason, he has 200 eggs in his refrigerator.  I think it's only seven dozen.  Oh, sorry.  Seven dozen eggs?  So that's 84?  Yeah.  Well, when I'm on my diet, I eat egg whites.  I make like scrambled eggs with like one yolk and like six egg whites. 
[00:32:30]  That's good?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And then I have chicken breast, and I don't have them now, but I usually have spinach.  I mix it with everything.  How much butter is in there?  Oh.  There's a couple tubs of Smart Balance buttery bread.  Ew.  Smart Balance.  Smart Balance.  It's good to know he's smart about his freaking butter.  Him whipping up an omelet, just looking at cat shit all over the place.  That's real smart. 
[00:33:00]  I thought it was a sausage omelet.  Oops.  I can't believe it's not edible.  Hey, Pat.  Yes?  Have you ever done the hard-boiled egg eating contest?  Actually, I was going to qualify for wing ball, but my pipes froze, and I tested it out on myself.  They were going to have me do 36 in five minutes.  I did it.  You ate 36 hard-boiled eggs in five minutes? 
[00:33:30]  Yep.  5.30, I believe it was.  Because we're debating, we might do a St. Paddy's Day show.  It was such a clusterfuck last year, we decided we should do it again this year.  But we're looking for some kind of main thing to do there, and we're thinking maybe the old Cool Hand Luke thing.  Yeah.  With green eggs or something, just to make it, you know, St. Paddy's festive.  What do you think?  Should we do that?  Yeah, I think so.  Have them eat the hard-boiled eggs until they puke?  I like it. 
[00:34:00]  I like it, too.  Hey, Pat, I have a question.  How old was the trailer when you got it?  Well, it's a 1970 Buddy, so it was...  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me do some math.  You're living in a 36-year-old trailer?  Yeah.  Do you know those things when they're made are supposed to have the lifespan of a fly?  Yeah, they're not supposed to last that long.  A few years, maybe.  Well, that explains the holes in the floor.  Yeah.  It's a Buddy, B-U-T-T-Y, because it's like shit. 
[00:34:30]  Oh.  Sorry, Pat.  Are you cold at night, Pat?  I think something landed down Sands back.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was pleasant.  Yeah, Pat, what about heat?  Like, what type of heat does that trailer have?  Kerosene.  Kerosene.  So...  Danny's shining a black light on my bed.  I don't know why.  Oh.  Oh, we love the black light.  How is that working out?  To be honest, it's already a kind of greenish color with dark stains already, and that's 
[00:35:00]  where the light's on it.  I asked him the results.  He said to think positive.  Yeah, the black light will make jizz stains glow like a Peter Max poster.  Poor Pat.  Pat.  Yes?  So it's a kerosene heater.  Is it one of those that, you know, you would buy at maybe Home Depot and fill it?  No, no, no, no.  It's a normal furnace, but it runs on kerosene.  Kerosene.  It's a big tank outside.  And does the heat, like, come out of vents, or is it like baseboard heating? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, I have vents.  Vents, so it's actually hot air.  Yeah.  That blows through.  That can someday, one of the chambers between the kerosene heat and the actual air that circulates  will rot away, and you will fucking die.  Next time you see Pat out at one of our events, just hand him money.  Yeah, he needs it.  Just discreetly hand him a pile of money.  How much would a trailer of that size be today?  I think new ones cost, like, $50,000.  Maybe a little less, but $50,000. 
[00:36:00]  That size, how big is it?  It's, like, 30 by 12.  30 by 12.  You could probably get a new one for about $40,000.  Yeah.  Pat, why don't you get an apartment?  You can get a nice apartment around there for $800 a month.  I'm used to this.  This is home sweet home.  I'm used to this.  Why don't you stop being used to it?  And, like, at night, like, 2 o'clock in the morning when I first moved in, they open  up the hangars at Teterboro Airport, which is right across the street from me. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  And they just fire up those engines at, like, 2 o'clock in the morning.  So at 2 in the morning, you have jet engines and airplane engines just starting up.  That is correct.  For all the executives that are really rich.  What happened to that plane?  Remember that plane that went through the wall, like, last year?  That was on the other side.  That was 46, the 46 side.  I think what happened, a guy actually flew over on the pile, looked down, and said,  people live there?  And he couldn't regain his own composure. 
[00:37:00]  People on that side get the planes taken off.  I get them while they're landing.  All right.  We should let you all go.  Oh.  They're saying that we've got to get you out of here.  Yeah.  People.  People are saying, I cannot wait to see the produced version of Cribs.  That's right.  That was all videotaped.  The guys are still there picking things up.  I see Danny touching something.  I'm trying to clean with my jacking.  See if I can get the cam to appreciate what Danny's doing. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, Danny.  I see Danny now shining the fluorescent light on Pat's bed.  My dog swallows.  All right.  You can get a doggy style.  You can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house, and I get the same.  This is my trailer.  All right, Pat.  Well, God bless.  Good luck, bro. 
[00:38:00]  Good luck, bro.  I hope things go better for you.  Yeah, someone on PalTalk is suggesting you guys find his porn.  It's there somewhere.  Find it.  Look under the bed, under the mattress.  That's right.  All right.  If anything else pops, you guys give us a call back.  God bless Yoshi.  That's all.  All right, man.  All right.  There they go.  It's Dan and Danny doing a great job with Pat from Menaki.  Wow.  They'll produce a whole Crip segment with Pat.  They'll get it up on the website.  Sad, sad, sad story, that is.  You know what we should do?  This is the idea.  Get a brand new trailer and bring Pat there and then say, this is not for you. 
[00:38:30]  This is not your trailer.  In 2002, darkness covered the land.  The Catholic League is praising Infinity Broadcasting for canceling the Opie and Anthony show.  And evil reigned supreme.  Who, who, Rob, Ben?  Until one day, they returned and all hell broke loose.  Bullshit.  Can you hear me?  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up. 
[00:39:00]  One Wednesday, I picked up a guy in a dress and he sucked my dick.  You just sit back and watch what happens next.  Opie.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Anthony.  Away with you.  Away.  Away.  Leave.  Leave the fucking studio.  Jim Norton.  Every one of you is a time-wasting cock piece.  I will beat children about the head.  And the O&A Army.  Our fans are a bunch of jackasses.

You're a fucking, you're just a little scumbag and I just spit in your fucking face.  I'd love to spit in your fucking face.  Fuck him!  And a battle that almost separated them forever.  I'm an actor.  You're insane.  You know how a show works and then you have these stupid opinions.  I understand you trying to do a radio show. 
[00:40:00]  We're not gonna do that, you ass!  Aw, don't get all angry and yell.  Jim, you're fucking pissing me off.  Whatever.  Holy shit.  What happens when love pushes you over the edge?  I gotta feel the tits!  Nowhere to run.  Who is this idiot on the radio?  Nowhere to hide.  You're shit out of luck.  And no way out.  Dance, motherfucker, dance.  Yeah, look at my cock.  The most anticipated thriller of the year.  Give to me the money.  I will make for you the like I fuck.

I'm Amy Flitas with the Bankrate.com Personal Finance Minute.  Now is the time to start searching for a summer camp for your child and planning on the cost.  A top-rated privately run specialty camp can cost up to $10,000, while a subsidized church camp can be as little as $10, and some camps are even free to needy kids. 
[00:41:30]  In general, experts say a four-week session at a privately run general interest camp will cost about $3,500.  General activities, meals, basic medical care, and incidentals such as laundry and awards are usually included.  But many camps offer optional extras such as added activities or field trips that can boost the bill.  Nonprofit and organizations camps such as YMCA are less expensive.  They range from around $1,200 to $3,000 per month.

There's some sexual reference.  Hey, here he is.  Hey, don't...  What's up, bro? 
[00:44:00]  Step up to the mic.  Hey, do you want to sit down or stand?  Actually, it doesn't make a difference, really.  No?  No.  You just stand?  Okay.  And what's your name, sir?  What's...  My name is Andrew.  Andrew?  Yes.  And a fan of the show?  Yes, a big fan of the show.  Big fan of the show?  Yes.  And you, I guess you're from the whackbag.com message board?  Oh, yes, I am.  I'm Wonka614.

I met your brother a couple times and taken pictures of him.  Joe.  And his band guests.  Absolutely.  What do you think of the crowd we got here today? 
[00:45:00]  Very nice.  Yeah, you see some of the beautiful young ladies?  Yeah, beautiful.  Yes, they are.  Very nice.  Quite beautiful.  What would be more beautiful than taking one and slicing their throat?  I think that's Jimmy's department.  Oh, well.  I think you could use some help.  Well, that's great.  What do you do for a living?  Oh, I drive a private cab in the Bronx.  A private cab in the Bronx?  In the Bronx? 
[00:45:30]  Jesus.  Wow.  How are you still alive?  You are.  Jesus.  You laugh at that shuttle crew.  Pretty much.  That is a dangerous gig.  You ever been robbed?  Well, thank God.  I haven't, no.  No, huh?  I haven't.  I haven't been robbed.  I got to ask, what the hell is that thing you do?  Is that sort of a stutter?  Yes.  Actually, it's a speech impediment. 
[00:46:00]  Speech impediment.  We love speech impediments, though.  We all have one in the studio.  I don't know you guys who goof on it, but I'm part of it.  No, no.  I just wanted to lay it out there on the table.  What's your name?  It's Andrew.  Oh, he said Andrew.  He said that already.  You don't listen to the people, Opie.  You don't pay attention, Opie.  I'm sorry.  You don't pay attention.  I just want to give him a new name.  What?  Stuttering Andrew.  Well, and you're driving a private cab up there in the Bronx. 
[00:46:30]  Yes, I do.  And a lot of, I guess you take a lot of black people around.  We have a lot of golfers, yes.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  A lot of golfers.  Yes.  And these are the people that normal, I guess normal cabs wouldn't pick up.  You're always hearing about cabs that don't pick up.  But you take anyone, anytime, anywhere. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah?  I mean, most of the calls are off the phones.  Oh, right.  So they call up and ask you, and you come pick them up.  Of course.  And drive.  And have some of these people, like, shown up and, you know, give me your money kind of thing?  Not yet, but I hope not.  Yeah.  Wow.  Can I just read the feedback?  Of course you can, Opie.  We just switched the show opener, but you know the show opener where I talk about how we're going to do this until we're number one with Down Syndrome children? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Well, George the Geek, somewhere in Jersey, writes, ding, ding, ding, we are now number one with Down Syndrome children.  Oh, he doesn't have Down Syndrome.  That is a hell of an impediment you got there, though.  Sometimes you just lock up, huh?  Sometimes I get nervous and I lock up.  Nervous, yeah, you lock up.  Like right now.  Right now you're a little nervous and you lock up.  Take it a little bit.  You know we're going to exploit this speech impediment, right?  Okay. 
[00:48:00]  Like, he should do the news today.  Oh, no shit.  You got anywhere to be or can you hang out for a little while?  Actually, I'm off today.  You're off, huh?  Actually, I called in sick today.  Boom!  I didn't want you to relax.  Keep your edge over there.  Don't let this guy relax.  Well, you're a fascinating man, Andrew.  Well, is there any girls that want to flash?  That could be very interesting with Andrew in the studio. 
[00:48:30]  It could be a little nerve-wracking, sure.  Yeah.  Can we find out?  One or two of the hotties out there.  Well, I think the girls from, what was the name of the company again?  What?  Sports Sexy.  That's from a bikini bar, I guess.  They're from a bikini bar in Jersey or something like that?  Yeah.  Very nice.  An Opie and Anthony panties.  We got Opie and Anthony panties?  Jesus.  Who knew those were?  Hey, I'm not complaining, but if you want to market the show, you got to have something 
[00:49:00]  that other people could see besides one at a time.  You are breathing a little heavy, aren't you?  Yeah.  A little bit.  And Mike, that really comes across on the air.  I like it.  Sounds like the elephant man running uphill.  All right, Andrew.  I like it.  Let's say hi to Taz.  Taz, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I want to know if this guy's lost his stapler. 
[00:49:30]  Hi, Stephener.  Yeah.  Stephener.  Very good.  If you call the show, you got to turn down the radio a little bit.  The Gooch in Cleveland.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  How are you?  Hey, I got a while on the way into work today.  Okay.  Going into 90 on Cleveland.  The chick lifted up her shirt on her tits.  It was written, Lil' Jimmy Norton Live, July 23rd.  Ah, you suck!  Tickets are available at Ticketmaster and EatABullet.com.  Thank you, mister.  Get out of here.  Andy, what's up? 
[00:50:00]  Andy, let's go.  Hey, what's up, Bobby and Anthony?  This is Andy.  Listen, SportsCenter is a cool bar, man.  It has plasma TVs, and the chicks are practically naked.  Yeah, they're barely wearing anything right now, so.  Yeah, man.  Correctly.  Cool.  It's pretty hot, man.  All right, we're going to get some of those girls in.  Listen, real quick, can I just say something?  Yeah.  I've been waiting for my wow sticker, man, for almost a year.  A year?  Did you send in a self-addressed stamped envelope?  Yeah.  All right, send in another one, and we'll make sure we get it out to you.  It might have been just a...  Hey, thanks, guys.  Hey, big fan over here, man. 
[00:50:30]  Let me just say hi to my brother, Larry.  You just did.  Thanks, bro.  No, thanks, guys.  All right.  Let's go to John the Trucker.  John?  Yo, shit dicks.  What's up, John?  Hey, gentlemen, I just came down to South Park.  I'm on my way to Philly, and around Newark Airport, down from Newark, down to Elizabeth,  there.  There's a bunch of unmarked cops hanging around down there.  All right.  They've got a bunch of four-wheelers pull over and stuff.  Jesus, what is Colin doing here?  Colin just pokes his head in to say he's at Caroline's this weekend. 
[00:51:00]  What is he doing awake?  All right, John.  So, John wants to tell us that there's a lot of cops on the turnpike.  We're going to be safe today.  Oh, boy.  Colin.  How are you doing, baby?  Colin, get over here, because you've got to hear this guy.  I like this guy.  That's Andrew.  All right.  This is Andrew, our new character.  Oh, this guy?  Yeah, we just found him today.  I was down, I was downstairs hanging out for 20 minutes.  You are?  With the bikers?  Yeah.  He's going to be a big star, this guy, Andrew.  Andrew drives a private, I guess, cab service in the Bronx. 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  Yes, I understand that Berkowitz took the hit for a couple of your boys, too.  Which is a very, I think, a very dangerous job for you.  For the passengers.  Now that we have a big star in the studio, it's really going to freak out, Andrew.  What do you think, Andrew?  Why don't you stalk me and kill me, to put me out of my misery?  That would be too easy.  Kill me.  Big fan of Colin?  Yeah.  I like him.  Very funny. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  You watch, did you watch Tough Crowd?  Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  Yeah, you watch Tough Crowd.  I'll give you, and I'm not kidding right now, I swear to you, I'll give you $10,000 over  the course of a couple of incremental payments if you kill Norton.  Doesn't have to be you on the air, just in your own time.  If Norton turns up strangled in a month, I'm going to send you $10,000.  And if it's Voss, $8,000.  And bring me Voss's teeth and prove that you killed him. 
[00:52:30]  I left her on my altar.  I was murdered on the altar.  I'm a martyr.  Should we bring this guy to Philly?  Is there anyone out there that could get him to Philly?  Everybody's listening to him out there.  They love him already.  Yeah.  Really?  I don't know.  He could be the official spokesperson for this damn thing.  You up for going to Philly?  Yeah.  Andrew and, somehow,  do you have a cell phone where you could call in the show?  Yeah, I have a cell phone.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you don't remove the mic from that guy. 
[00:53:00]  Ever.  Ever.  Don't get too close to him.  You ever see something about Mary?  He grabs the...  Hey.  By the way, one of the bikers down there has a little half-ostridge shell cup  for Norton to ride along in as a hatchling.  As a hatchling.  That's great.  It's got to be a half.  You can't put him in the hole because he's already lost his egg tooth that he chips out  of the egg with.  He's just like this the whole trip. 
[00:53:30]  He would just be stranded.  At the truck stops, he could regurgitate food into his mouth to feed him.  All right.  We're going to have to get Andrew to go to Philly because we need to talk to you all day.  You have a cell phone, though, right?  Yes, I have a cell phone.  You must have a plan with a lot of minutes because I think any conversation probably takes  you a long time.  All you've got to do is remember one thing for the rest of your life.  Yes.  The scratches on my hands are from my cat, officer.  Hey, is Pat from Menaki downstairs?  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Could Andrew ride with Pat?  That would be a great team.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  And then we'll have Pat and Andrew check in from the ride, and then we'll have Keith  the cop checking in.  It's going to be a great day.  It's the WOW motorcycle ride.  I have some pallets of cinder blocks in the back of the van so it doesn't just flip  over forward with these two in there.  Kind of hefty, aren't you?  What do you eat poorly?  Actually, I'm on a diet to lose weight right now, actually.  You are?  Yes, I am.  How's that working out for you? 
[00:54:30]  Not bad.  Not bad?  How long have you been on it?  About three weeks.  Three weeks?  And have you lost any weight?  Over 10 pounds.  Over 10 pounds.  Not bad.  Congratulations.  Do you have a gal?  No, I don't.  No?  No.  Besides, you know, under a pile of lime in your basement?  Not enough trunk space.  You grew up in the Bronx?  You grew up in the Bronx, didn't you?  Yes.  I knew it.  Yes.  Really?  That must have been a tough upbringing, huh? 
[00:55:00]  You get beat up by the black people?  No?  You grew up in the Italian part.  Oh, yeah?  In the Italian part?  Is that where you were?  Close.  Wow.  Wow.  We have a lot of calls coming in.  Let's go to John in Ohio.  John?  Yeah.  Hey.  Go ahead, John.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, they got to take Andrew down to Philly with them so he can hold the bikes up when  they use his retard strength to change the tires.  Obviously, the guy is of sound mind. 
[00:55:30]  Obviously.  Just has a speech impediment.  People sometimes think maybe you're mentally incapacitated a little bit because of your speech  impediment?  Sometimes.  Sometimes, yeah.  If that guy from Ohio could have seen Andrew's eyes when he said retard strength, he would have  took it back even in Ohio.  Yeah.  His eyes just went like, all right.  Yeah.  Daddy beat me senseless, and that's why I'm shy, but I swear to God, nobody touches me  again.  I will kill this guy.  He's going to kill him.  All right.  We should get some more of these people in here before we start the ride.  Where's the... 
[00:56:00]  Bring a couple of the girls in, then.  Keep Andrew right where he is, though, man.  Danny, I bow to you today.  I want to see which ones Eric picks.  By the way, Anthony, we've got to acknowledge Danny today.  Danny found Andrew.  Danny.  Danny took it upon himself to go down there and record some of these people.  He's a star.  He's right.  You can tell.  See, Colin, this is what it's all about, right?  Holy Mary.  Well, Corinne called me up and told me that this was going to happen.  Oh, my God.  Hey, ladies.  Hi.  This is Andrew.  Hi.  Hello.  Andrew, say it.  What do you think, Andrew? 
[00:56:30]  Very nice.  I would have said it the same way, so I don't feel strange.  Imagine what you could do with them with a bow saw and some duct tape, right?  Girls, be careful.  Dress like that.  Your breasts might come out on the drive down.  Be careful.  You could get a violation.  You know what I'm saying?  Wow.  These are lovely young ladies, aren't they?  And you're all dancers?  No.  Do you dance at all?  No.  No, it's like a bikini bar, right?  It's a bikini bar.  You just kind of strut around in your bikinis. 
[00:57:00]  Is it an all-ages bar?  They look 14.  How old are you, ladies?  Is there anything wrong with that?  How old are you all?  21, 18, 22, 21.  And 39.  That's great.  I heard 39.  Who was 39?  39.  Who said that?  Jesus.  Very nice.  And you guys are going to go to Philly with us today?  Yeah.  Awesome.  We're going to have a good time.  There's going to be a big party going on.  They're wearing something in your honor.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You guys want to show them your special, special, special panties? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, my God.  They got...  Oh, look at that.  Show them what it says on the back.  They got open wow on the back.  With wow on the back.  Are we handing out the panties today?  It's just a bevy of very nice asses.  I'm not complaining.  It just turned around.  What a great promotional item for the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone's got to wow Andrew.  Huh?  Someone has to wow Andrew.  Yeah.  Andrew, it's Whip Mal Wednesday.  Someone's got to wow Andrew.  Is there any girls that are willing to wow Andrew?  You know Corrine doesn't play games.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, Corrine will do it. 
[00:58:00]  Donkey sauce.  Hold on.  You got to get them on mic, though.  That's the whole gag.  What do you think there, Andrew?  Yeah, I got to shut the curtain.  Oh, baby.  Nice.  Oh, Jesus.  Beautiful.  Wow.  You are about the creepiest son of a bitch I've ever, ever come across.  That right hand is twitching.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  How long does it take to choke one of these bitches out?  You got to know down to the second. 
[00:58:30]  You ever seen a stepfather?  Yeah.  It sounds like you had a strict upbringing.  Are we here to talk about me or buy a house?  Hey, you girls are friendly holding hands.  That's cute.  That's very cute.  There's a bunch of them holding hands.  You're just kind of supporting each other.  Is that it?  Yeah.  She's my girlfriend.  She's your girlfriend?  She's my girlfriend.  You don't have to say no, you're just kidding.  Just leave it at that.  Just let that one lie there.  Well, girls love to do the fake lesbian stuff now. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  They kind of make believe a little bit.  Right?  Yeah, it's a little forced, but sometimes it probably leads to real stuff.  Okay.  I bet lesbians love it.  Yeah.  Real ones because they're like, oh.  What celebrity does everyone tell you you look like?  You.  Me?  Yeah.  I get Jennifer Love Hewitt.  I see it.  There it is.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  What about Eva Longiorio from that other show, The Walking Desperate?  Wow, very, very nice. 
[00:59:30]  And look, Andrew, he's just chomping at the bit.  Andrew, are you sporting?  Not yet, but almost.  I got to ask you, you mind a couple of not ridiculous personal questions, but maybe a  little personal question.  When was the last time you hooked up?  And by that, I don't mean a block and tackle and a hook in your basement.  I mean, like got a woman, had the pleasure of a woman. 
[01:00:00]  About a year ago.  A year ago?  Yeah.  Did you pay for it?  No.  No?  But she did.  Sleeping under a pile of leaves somewhere.  She was at three in the morning.  She was leaving some club in Yonkers.  I said, he's Chester Avenue.  Where are we going?  Her new address, Shallow Grave, right?  Co-op city.  Yeah, like a year ago?  Give us the details.  How did that happen?  Was it a bar?  Was it a fair? 
[01:00:30]  Actually, it was a customer, actually.  A customer?  I like this story already.  Picked her up in the cab?  You start, what, chit-chatting a little bit?  Late night?  Actually, I had you guys on, actually.  Oh, really?  Really?  It was just talking and chatting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're talking.  She asked me what time I got off.  Uh-huh. 
[01:01:00]  And I hooked up with her after I got off.  Oh.  Went to her house.  That's nice.  Went to her place?  Yeah.  And, uh, what, maybe a little, uh, drink?  You partake in a little of the drink?  Yeah, occasionally, yes.  A little bit?  Yes.  And then, uh, and what did this girl look like?  Yik.  Yik?  All right.  That's gratitude.  Yeah.  Yik.  Yik.  Well, you won't find any yiks today on the way down to Philly, that's for sure. 
[01:01:30]  If you could take that as a compliment, girls.  What an awful compliment.  No yiks here.  Maybe we should set, uh, Andrew up with Stalker Patty.  Well, you ever met Patty?  Actually, I've taken a couple pictures of her.  Yeah?  And talking with her.  Yeah.  Before.  Patty, have you met, uh, Andrew?  Yeah, outside on the street, coming over.  Yeah, coming over.  What do you think of him?  They're all very nice. 
[01:02:00]  They're all very nice?  Yeah, he's very nice.  All the guys are very nice.  All his personalities.  Everybody's nice.  Would, would you maybe, uh, if, you know, and we'd be willing to foot the bill here, would  you go out on a date with Andrew?  I think both of you could use maybe a little company.  Of course I would.  All right, maybe we could set that up.  Sure, I'd go out on a date.  A little, uh, night out on the town here in Manhattan.  You go to dinner.  Maybe a little dancing or something.  You dance at all, uh, Patty? 
[01:02:30]  Um, just by myself at home when I'm exercising.  I do my aerobics.  Oh, Christ.  You don't.  These two are perfect for each other.  What music do you listen to?  Let's get physical, physical.  A lot of dance tunes from the 60s mostly by the, um, Four Seasons or Screams or something  like that.  Yeah, Stomp every alum, Clyde.  And then some of the disco things, you know, like electric slides. 
[01:03:00]  She's a maniac, maniac on the floor.  And she's dancing like she never danced before.  With her leg warmers.  Oh, I like that at the net when I sing.  Oh, she could use, like, those wrist, those wrist warmers for leg warmers.  What are they called?  I stink.  Trying to reenact that scene from Flashdance with the water.  Oh, no.  She lays back in the chair and pulls the little rope and the bucket full of water hits her. 
[01:03:30]  Should be blood and she should be in a prom dress on a stage.  Patty, I stopped by your work yesterday.  I know you did.  Oh, good driver.  I was off.  I know.  I stopped by your diver to see Patty.  Colin got some chocolate.  No, I stopped by to see Patty.  Oh, you really did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a good guy.  A couple people have been by, you know, when I've been there.  Opie came.  Emma, you come a lot of times.  Oh.  Please not see me, man.  Andrew, me, and you may have to kick it out.  Well, not a lot of times, but you come every once in a while.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, I only seropied there once.  And that's the only time you'll see me there.  That was a major coincidence.  Brad in Dallas, what's up?  Yeah, I was wanting to know if this cat, Andrew, would mind saying,  some people call it a Kaiserblade, I call it a singer.  That's every good day, man.  All right.  And, Andrew, would you mind going out with Patty, maybe, for a night out?  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, I would.  Yeah.  Be honest, though.  Is she your type?  We like honesty on this show.  What do you think of Patty? 
[01:04:30]  You know, with the awful pulse and breathing.  Your type?  Somehow I don't think this is his impediment coming in.  I think he's just not speaking.  Well, you have a relative comparison to make with the rest of the room.  Well, that is true.  Yeah, it's a tough morning for her to be.  Out of these girls right here, there's such a variety of beauty in the studio.  Which is the most your type?  Don't be shy.  Just point one out that is the most your type of girl.  You have blondes, brunettes, tall. 
[01:05:00]  They're all looking away.  Petite.  They're all looking away.  Usually you do that, and the girls will look at the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Hoping.  I don't know.  In this case, they're all turning around looking at the wall.  Andrew, you have to know right away.  It's a thing guys know.  They can look at a group of girls, and you know which type, which one you find your type.  He's just trying to not cock-bot himself with the rest of them.  Which one?  Over there.  What's your name, Missy?  Blonde.  Blonde.  Oh, my God.  Victim number one.  Step up to the mic. 
[01:05:30]  You're the lucky one he chose.  What's your name?  Christina.  Christina.  Yes.  And how tall a gal are you?  Five, eight and a half.  You're five, eight and a half.  Blonde hair.  Very attractive girl.  Thank you.  Very beautiful.  And you are Andrew's type.  Great.  Would you object to being in a well with a poodle?  No.  It puts the fucking lotion. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, you mean that blonde girl, Christina?  Yes.  I know who she was.  She used to live here.  Well, what do you think of Andrew?  He's a nice guy.  A nice guy, right?  Yeah.  Seemed nice enough.  Kind of a loner.  Never really talked to the neighbors much.  And then the horrific find.  Occasionally brought out lumpy shopping bags. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, you just, I fast forward maybe a few months down the road.  Just seeing cops pulling out boxes and boxes out of his apartment with tape over them.  That yellow tape.  Do not fuck with this box tape.  Watch your weird female driver's licenses in a box.  That's some jewelry.  They call those trophies.  Yeah, so he found you.  Well, would you ever go out with a guy like Andrew?  Just based on, I know he's a nice guy.  And if you sat down and talked to him, you'd probably shoot yourself. 
[01:07:00]  But if you got to know him a little bit, maybe things would be different.  But just on first impression, would you go out with a...  Probably not.  Probably not?  No.  What's your type?  Not him.  This is brutal.  No offense.  I'm sorry.  Andrew, you have to know that whatever, you know, you're dealt a hand in life and you've got to play it.  And obviously...  Andrew, basically, it's trying to tell you you've got to aim a lot lower. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, you've got to aim lower.  If he really kept working out and going to keep on a diet and then you shaved your head and grew like the goatee, maybe some earrings, a little...  Yeah, you might be able to hook yourself up a little better.  You're not working.  Welcome to the OPNC.  Die, you son of a bitch!  NHL game, play-by-play on XM.  This is Dan Blakely.

Hey, what's up, this is David from the band Disturbed.  Yeah, hey, this is Tim Ferriss.  I'm J.D. Fortune, and we're from InXS.  Hey, this is Carmen Lovana, and you're listening to The Worst.  Hey, this is Tom Morello from Audioslave.  Hey, this is Jesse Jay, and you're listening to The Worst.  Hey, what's going on, this is Gary Hoey, and you're listening to The Worst. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, this is Suzy Essman, and you're listening to The Worst.  Hello, this is the hardcore legend Mick Foley, and you are listening to The Worst.  What's up, this is Dane Cook.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Holy crap, this is awesome.  Anthony, it's Super Bowl.  It is going to happen today.  Super Bowl is today.  It is Super Bowl Thursday, as it's been known throughout history.  Out, recorded history.  Everyone, it's like an American holiday, Opie, Super Bowl Thursday. 
[01:12:00]  People take the day off, they gather around their radio.  Family, friends, 8-foot heroes, keggers.  And they just want to listen to true sport, the sport of the Super Bowl.  And I think it's going to be a little scary today because we've got EMTs pacing back and forth outside the studio  with all sorts of paperwork and things.  Based on this program, they should be here every day.  Every day, right.  Every day.  Then there's an ambulance.  Right downstairs.  Right downstairs waiting just in case someone has an allergic reaction today. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  We have this creepy bug guy that came by.  I don't know how he has so many creepy bugs.  I'll tell you why he's a creepy bug guy because he has a lot of really creepy bugs that I've never seen in my life.  He decided to just bring in an array of bugs.  Here he is.  Big collection.  This is the guy that is saving Super Bowl so we can do the ultimate challenge.  What's your name, bro?  Ken.  Hey, Ken.  Nice to have you here today.  Nice to meet you guys.  Well, you want to bring some of your bugs in? 
[01:13:00]  Sure.  We can have a little show and tell.  Yeah.  Where are you from?  New Jersey.  Why did I know that before you said it?  Creepy bug guy has to be from New Jersey.  And we can collect this stuff from most of the buildings in New Jersey.  I don't doubt that.  Yuck.  Wait.  Like, this is your job to...  What is your job?  Yeah, what's your job that you have these bugs?  We sell feeder insects nationwide to pet stores.  Oh, okay.  Sure.  Bait shops, that kind of thing.  Right.  So the mealworms over there would be for your reptile, your lizards, things like that. 
[01:13:30]  For lizards.  The bigger ones, the bigger, larger mealworms are for bait.  And what about the cockroaches?  Why would people need these?  I see them all the time on this show.  For some reason, they're a staple of this program.  What would people need one of those for, aside from a radio show?  Just to feed reptiles.  Sometimes they keep them as pets.  Are those the hissing cockroaches?  Yeah, I have some hiscers there.  If you touch them, they hiss.  Yeah, Matagascar.  You got to hear these things. 
[01:14:00]  You know what?  I'm proud to say we introduced the world to the hissing cockroach.  Oh, yes.  Way before...  National Geographic.  Way before Fear Factor.  Yeah, true.  We were doing...  55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah, we were doing things with the hissing cockroaches many, many years ago.  You got to bring one of those to the mic, because this is the creepiest sound.  And they're...  Listen to this.  Ah, E-Rock's running.  Well, listen to what this thing will do when you touch it. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, God.  Right now, it's borrowing into my hand, too.  I see that.  That hissing noise.  Can you find those in New York?  Yeah.  No, I'm serious.  Can you find those in buildings?  Like, I see...  No, no.  In my apartment, I see a cockroach every once in a while, but I'll never see a hissing  cockroach, right?  Aren't they from Matagascar?  Yeah, these are actually from Matagascar.  They're just indigenous to tropical regions. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  We're not allowed to sell these in Florida, because they can live down there.  If these were to get loose here, they'd only be able to live during the summer, and  they'd die as soon as the temperature went down.  Right.  Like the homeless.  Like just...  Yeah.  The homeless in France.  Yeah.  Oh, but somewhere in Florida, you let those go, and uh-oh, could be a problem.  Yeah.  Two of them get together, hook up.  Well, we got to have a little sex.  Yeah, yeah.  The males have bumps on their heads, and the females don't, so that's how you can tell them  apart.  Oh, that's how you can tell?  And the males hiss.  The females don't.  Yeah.  Wow.  They're kind of opposite of humans. 
[01:15:30]  Exactly.  Where the male keeps quiet, and the woman is just, you know, yap, yap, yap.  Yeah.  Hiss, hiss, hiss.  And if she does, she usually ends up with bumps on her head.  Ha, ha, ha.  Well, I got the list of insects in front of me here.  The hissing roaches, maggots, superworm beetles.  Yeah.  What's that?  Uh, these are the superworm beetles.  Uh, if you smell, if you touch them, they'll release a pheromone, and, which is an attractant,  like a sexual attractant, which is something that females also do, are females. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  But they have, uh, they, they also secrete a brown liquid that'll stain your hands, but  they stink.  So does Jimmy Norton, coincidentally enough, when, uh, when he's out on dates.  Is that right?  Yeah.  This, these, uh, they, they, they, they smell too.  But, these will also do, like, a little, uh, tickle, nibble kind of thing.  Not that I've tried it, but if you, if you were to, you know, place your stuff in there,  you would, you'd definitely get it.  Your bag on top of that. 
[01:16:30]  You'd get a sensation.  Now, none of these are poisonous.  Except maybe the honeybees, if you're allergic.  The bees, the bee venom.  And there they are.  Yeah.  The bees.  Now, I saw your contraption, which is very phallic.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Once, these, once they place their, their bag, I guess, in that contraption, that appendage  that sticks out, should be blown into.  Uh, the reason for that is that it'll, the warm air will get these guys angry. 
[01:17:00]  Oh.  So someone has to blow into the phallic appendage.  Yeah, to the tip of that.  As, as some guy's sack is hanging in the Tupperware portion.  You know, I've been fighting this for so long, I give up.  This show is gay.  What a gay show we're on.  This is a gay show.  So you're telling me, as the expert, that someone has to blow into the tube to get these  bees going.  Someone does, and I'm, I'm not expert enough to do that myself.  What is it about, uh, human breath that, um, riles up the bees? 
[01:17:30]  I, I don't know if it's the, just the heat and the moisture or the, something, you know,  instinctive in them that just sets them off.  E-Rock can't do it because it will be a bee holocaust.  It'll be like the showers at Dachau.  No, if they're, I, I got stung by, by these bees.  It's, I got stung about 10 times just collecting them.  This is how, wait, you got stung 10 times yesterday?  This is how dedicated this guy is to the show.  I love this show.  He's the one that stepped up and said, all right, I'll get the bees for the guys. 
[01:18:00]  Look at his hand.  It's all swollen.  I got my hand, my arms.  He got stung 10 times.  He's allergic to bees.  And this is not fat.  It's a swollen bee venom in my.  Are you kidding?  No, yeah.  I'm kidding.  I'm fat.  I don't know.  What, uh, I know.  I'm like, wow, that stuff must collect in the liver.  Right.  What, uh, oof, what do you do to collect them?  I just, I just went in and I just stuck a stick in, got them angry.  When they came out, I brushed them into cups and they just went all over me and started  stinging.  So you got what, what, one of those big box type hive things. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  The hives you were talking about.  Yeah.  I'm one of those guys.  How many?  Uh, I have three hives.  And what is it for?  Just honey or?  Just to pollinate.  Yeah.  And for honey, uh, make wine out of the honey.  Mead.  Really?  Mead.  Ah, yes, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a good old fashioned way to get drunk.  Days of old.  How many times do you get stung a year?  Having bees?  No, just a couple.  Uh, last, last, uh, last summer I had some go up my shorts, which is how I know these  will work.  And I got, and I, I have, uh, my daughters were out there and they're little and they 
[01:19:00]  just saw the bees going up.  They saw me fall over on the ground screaming and, and, uh, it's got to horrify the children.  Oh, they were laughing.  They were laughing at me while I, I thought that that was done.  I was at no more kids.  All right.  Hold on.  Ben's raw.  Ben's raw ass has something.  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Hey, I want to know if this dude bought his, uh, cock clicking.  What's, what's, what's, what's that?  Cock licking ball roaches.  That's from what I say.  Are you doing a callback of his awful, uh, line yesterday? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  I'm the awful calling guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Ben's raw ass, everyone.  All right.  Uh, what else is there?  Anything of interest?  Um, just, these are just regular German roaches.  We have, we also have some flightless fruit flies.  We, we've bred these so that they wouldn't have wings.  So if you look at them, they kind of look like ants, but they're actually fruit flies.  Okay.  And what the hell can they possibly do?  They just, they just exist and people feed them to frogs.  Oh yeah.  That kind of thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you sell these to pet shops? 
[01:20:00]  Pet shops, bait stores, and then regular just reptile enthusiasts.  Now obviously you've brought a lot of this stuff in just for show, but can we use anything  else there on the table except for the beef?  Yeah.  I think like these are super worms.  You know, these are the other things that you see them eating on, uh, like fear factor  and that kind of thing.  Yeah.  So they, and they stink.  They'll also nibble and stuff, but they're getting a little, uh, lethargic here.  A little tired.  Is it the cold?  Yeah.  Oh, and just so you guys know too, when you're ready for mosquitoes, let me know, just give  me a week's notice and I can hatch you out a bunch of mosquitoes. 
[01:20:30]  See, we wanted, uh, we thought about that way too late.  We wanted to do the mosquitoes as well.  Yeah.  Cause a mosquito bites on your bag.  I've never, thank God I've never been bitten on the bag.  I would say the mosquito bite on the bag would be worse than getting stung by a bee.  On the bag.  Uh, maybe the instant pain.  Yeah.  The bee more terrifying knowing it's happening, but a mosquito doing it, you know, after, after  he's done, I think it would be much more of a problem.  And the quick pain from the bee sting, but then you have that residual itching, big bump 
[01:21:00]  on your nut kind of thing you got to deal with.  You got to do the whole thing.  You do the thumb and forefinger.  Only a guy could know about the thumb and forefinger roll of the bag.  Like it's, you sit there like a dog scratching himself.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It is wonderful.  It's the other ecstasy.  That's the other ecstasy.  Oh, all right.  The other ecstasy.  Sorry.  And we have wax worms.  Yeah.  Wax worms.  Yeah.  You brought a lot of tame insects. 
[01:21:30]  I got to tell you.  Yeah.  These are, these are pretty, pretty tame.  These, these are, if you look at these, these are real maggots, regular housefly.  They'll eat bodies and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah?  Which is always good for, you know, a guinea from Jersey.  Wow.  No.  I've never seen maggots before.  All right.  She doesn't seem to like the maggots.  Very nice.  Okay.  All right.  Well, we got to thank you for bringing the bees in.  Yes.  And getting stung doing it. 
[01:22:00]  Look at his right hand.  I know.  It's all swollen.  It's all swollen.  You were taking Benadryl all night long?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, but it doesn't do what it does for most people, you know.  Right.  You need the epi shot, right?  Yeah.  Why'd you get stung?  They didn't like being taken out of the hive at night.  Oh, were they sleeping?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got one of those hives.  Pissed off bees.  Yes.  And you woke them and they were like all biting you?  They bit me all over.  Oh, they were pissed off.  But we got a whole container.  There's got to be, what, 30, 40 in there?  Yeah, and I brought some backups just in case. 
[01:22:30]  So what will you do with these when you don't have them?  I guess, I don't know if I'm going to even want to touch them after they've been, you know.  Yeah, that's true.  Probably just open up the container near the hive and see what happens.  They call them faggot bees after that.  See if they come back.  Boy, but those honeybees are nothing compared to the wasps I saw in that video last night.  Did you watch that open?  I didn't see it.  Oh, God, it is unbelievable.  These killer wasps.  The hornets, Japanese hornets.  The hornets, yeah.  There were 30 of them that took out 30,000 honeybees, took out a whole colony. 
[01:23:00]  30 of these huge wasps come flying in.  One of them comes in, marks it.  Like he goes out on a little scouting mission, marks the hive.  What, this is a video that shows the whole process?  I said the clip of the Japanese hornets I told you about.  Yeah, yeah, the Japanese hornets, and it's filmed very well.  I mean, they get these up-close views of everything.  They get inside the nooks and crannies in the hive and everything.  And the hornet flies back to his crew and goes, hey, I found some honeybees. 
[01:23:30]  I marked it with some theramon or whatever the hell they call it.  Yeah.  And then they take off.  And they get to the honeybee hive and just with these huge jaws start biting these bees in half.  They were just, and you're watching bee heads falling and bodies just kind of shaking around.  They went through the entire colony in what?  Three hours.  Three hours.  It took 30 of these wasps to kill 30,000 honeybees.  And they couldn't gang up on the wasps? 
[01:24:00]  Were they trying?  They were trying.  They killed like a couple of them with the stingers that they have, but just no match.  But then at the end they showed this honeybee colony that has a system.  The wasp comes in.  And, yeah, this hornet comes in to the tracking hornet, the initial just one.  And as he's laying down his theramones, the honeybees gather around him and start shaking.  And from their shaking they work up so much friction that it gets up to 120 degrees. 
[01:24:30]  And the bees can take 120 degrees.  The hornet can't.  How the hell do they figure that out?  They cook the hornet alive, and he never gets to go back and tell his crew where they are.  And they just figure this out.  Yeah.  You've got to love nature.  Yeah.  They did this little weird abdominal shift thing.  The hornet flies in.  All these honeybees are sitting there kind of moving.  And then all of a sudden every one of them goes,  quarter turn to the left. 
[01:25:00]  And that told all of them to jump on this hornet and start shaking.  Like where does that come from?  It's the way you feel as a white guy when you walk into a black club.  You just feel like everybody is doing some kind of a signal,  and they're going to attack you at any second.  You walk into the wrong bar, and you feel like everybody's just kind of like looking at you  and signaling each other.  That is crazy.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're going to get to you and your honeybees in a little while, bro.  Thank you so much for helping out the show.  Thank you.  We just didn't think we were going to pull off the old bee trick today.  No.  Those holes are too small. 
[01:25:30]  Too big, I mean.  They're covered up with some kind of membrane.  I wouldn't even touch that, though,  because I'd be afraid one of them would poke their stinger up through that.  Yeah, I had them in a plastic bag originally,  and they were stinging me even through the plastic bag.  Oh.  Yeah, he just got stung like crazy.  Now, where's the contraption?  Let's bring the contraption in again.  Are we going with the contraption?  Yeah, because intern Bill modified the thing.  Oh, intern Bill did.  Yeah, bring intern Bill in.  Is it true that you tried to collect intern Bill as a new insect? 
[01:26:00]  Here's Bill.  Here's the phallic apparatus that the boys will be using today.  Got two of them.  And we just learned that someone's going to have to blow into the tube to get the honeybees riled up.  Riled up because they don't like human breath.  Bill, are you willing to blow into the tube?  Blow into it?  Yeah.  While it's attached to the guy, though.  But the guy's got to put his sack in there, and then you have to blow it.  Well, you don't have to get more than a foot away from his bag because you've got to blow in the front of that tube. 
[01:26:30]  You've got to blow into the front of the phallic tube, yeah.  There's got to be better ways than that.  How about if maybe you can just blow on his balls and then put the thing on real fast after?  Yeah.  I was trying to be helpful.  Now, how did you modify it?  Well, instead of just using whatever we originally had, I put gloves, latex gloves, and stretch them out across the hole which the balls are going to go in.  And the balls will fit through comfortably?  Comfortably enough that the bees won't get out.  And the bees won't be able to get out? 
[01:27:00]  No.  As long as they don't rip them out while the bee's stinging them and pulls them out.  Yeah.  Within moderation, this should work very well.  With basic odds, what are the odds?  We've got to remove some of that tape around that so we can watch the bees.  Yeah, we've got to be able to watch it.  So cut it away, maybe.  Maybe cut it away slightly.  I'm trying to razor it off.  Yeah, razor it off or something.  Yeah, we've got to be able to see that.  The backs, I'm trying to keep open as the windows mostly.  Well, also, we see the back of his balls.  That's wonderful.  No, see, but, well, the problem is, this is the only part you're not going to be able to see because this is going to be up against their body. 
[01:27:30]  His taint.  Yeah.  Yeah, we need to clear that open.  How do you think they're going to do it like this?  Well, they might be able to do it.  Or you could do it sideways because they're just dropping it in, right?  It can really go any way.  I guess you're right.  It doesn't have to stick out like a big penis.  I would just make more room so we can see from other angles, I guess.  Odds-wise, what are the odds, as you're loading the bees in here, that some bees will escape into this tube?  He's not an expert at this.  We're fucked.  Yeah, I've never done this.  This is close to 100 bees the more I look at this container. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, I don't know how.  We need to get just a few in these tubes.  I don't know how we're going to transfer them.  How would you load bees into that?  I think we're going to get a plastic tube, and we're going to try to transfer them that way.  This way they'll go through the tube into that thing, and then we'll close it off.  Sure they will.  The neat thing is going to be that when honey bees sting, they die afterward because they lose their stinger.  Yeah.  So their stinger will actually be stuck in their balls, and they'll just keep pumping away, secreting that poison.  Is that what it does? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, and so if you don't let them pull that stinger out, it'll just make everything just a little worse.  Oh, God.  Wasps can sting multiple times, so are they going to go after the bees in these things?  Wait, we have wasps?  Yeah, some guy showed me a wasp at some point.  Where?  We have more bees out there?  I don't know.  I don't know where he went.  He just had a wasp in a gerber jar.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, bring him in.  Who has wasps?  Who's this guy?  I don't know.  He's got some goodies, too, though. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, bro.  What's up, man?  How's it going?  I got that mic there.  You brought a wasp in?  I got a bunch of wasps.  How'd you get these?  We work for the phone company.  Yeah?  They sting the shit out of us all the time.  I bet.  Holy crap.  I got two singles and two jars with four.  How'd you get them?  Mike dug them out of a pedestal yesterday.  Oh, these are yellow jackets, no?  No, they're paper wasps.  Oh, that wasp is nasty. 
[01:29:30]  And then if we heat this up, those guys will be dancing around like your bee sound effects.  Oh, God.  Is that a whole nest in there?  Yeah, pretty much.  Holy crap.  Wait, what do you do?  When you're up on the pole, you're going to grab something and they just fucking attack you?  You pop a terminal open and right in your face.  And you look like a lunatic waving your hard hat in the air.  I got the spray with me that we kill them with just in case.  Why don't you spray it before you open it?  Sometimes we do.  If you see an opening, you squirt it in the sides.  If you see them kind of swarming around before you do it. 
[01:30:00]  How many times have you gotten stung on the job?  I got it about over half a dozen.  Most notable being on the flat part of my ear.  I used to get that with attic jobs when we do jobs in the attic.  And I would just leave.  I'd be like, hey, there's bees here.  I'm not doing the job.  Fuck it.  Hey, yeah.  They were all, like, clustered up.  Oh, that was just so goddamn frightening.  But with these, all you got to do is open a jar and press it against its nuts and rattle it up a little bit.  If we heat that up, like last night when we were in the office breaking them up, they were crawling and very active. 
[01:30:30]  But overnight, it's cool now.  Pissed off.  Yeah, it gets a little colder.  Right.  Oh, I got the heebie-jeebies officially.  Yeah, that little nest there.  Who is this?  The ooper?  Youper.  The youper.  What's up?  Hey, I love the show, guys.  I just wanted to say when you get one of your boys to blow on a tube, make sure it's not E-Rocker.  It's bad Beth.  It'll kill a bee.  Well, I...  The joke was made earlier, sir. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  You're more nervous you went, bad Beth?  Yeah, I did.  I've noticed on Pal Talk.  The girls showing up a lot earlier today on the Pal Talk cams.  Anytime guys' testicles are going to be exposed here on the program, the ladies figure it's their day.  Well, who's going to be the expert here?  On balls or bees?  On bees.  I'll determine if someone's stung.  My method is very simple. 
[01:31:30]  If they scream and drop a jar, we have to check.  Well, how are we going to get these bees into the contraption?  Well, they're pretty slow right now.  I could probably wrangle it pretty slow right now.  I could probably wrangle a couple in there.  Can we do this outside?  Yeah, this will be done outside of the studio.  No, I mean outside.  Oh, you mean outside, outside?  It'd be better because they'd stay cold.  Yeah?  As long as they're cold, they're going to move around like that.  Then we bring them in and heat them up.  Don't drop those.  And they're going to get nuts.  I got no problem.  Callously? 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  Carelessly.  No, callous.  Yeah?  Wouldn't callously be if he was like throwing them around and spitting on them?  Yes, that was kind of why I was saying that the way he was handling them to me was callous.  All right.  Also, with wasps, I believe your creepy guy could confirm this, but they don't lose their stinger like bees.  No.  They're just going to keep jabbing and jabbing and jabbing.  Yeah.  They're a tough guy.  And these guys aren't allergic to bees? 
[01:32:30]  The Super Bowl guys?  That's what they say.  How did you get that nest?  You just dug it out?  Well, yeah.  Just knocked it right out of the tunnel and went into a jar.  Actually, into a water bottle.  Really?  He squeezed all that through the neck of a water bottle, and last night I cut the water bottle open and started to break them up into individual jars.  Whoa.  Ballsy move.  They were sleeping?  Ballsy move, my friend.  So, all right.  Game on.  We have plenty of bees.  We have wasps.  We have something that looks like yellow jackets, but they're not.  You're saying they're paper wasps?  I looked up yesterday to let Steve know exactly what they were. 
[01:33:00]  Okay.  Paper wasps.  I have no problem with them loading that outside.  Yeah.  Just so there's a complete barrier between us here in the studio and loose bees.  Well, there's a lot of bees.  That's the problem.  I can understand if we try to transfer one or two and it gets loose, whatever.  But there's like, I mean, that jar is close to 100.  No, I don't even want one bee loose in here.  And this is, uh...  Turn it over.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look how many are on the bottom.  Yeah, the whole bottom.  Yeah, kidding.  There's got to be close to 100 in this jar as well.  And then individual wasps. 
[01:33:30]  You know, mixing them together might really get them angry.  Yeah.  Oh, what, like different camps?  Yeah, like a couple of different...  You mix the wasps and the honeybees and stuff.  Oh, big race war.  Some kind of conglomerated, a lot of mongrel class of bees.  The balls will be the battlefield.  Yeah, that's for sure.  That's great.  And this is just the grand finale.  Yeah.  Finale, excuse me.  The ultimate challenge.  It's the ultimate challenge.  This is like a decathlon of the nutsack. 
[01:34:00]  We're just waiting for the beekeeper suits.  They're coming at 8 o'clock.  I want a beekeeper suit.  All right.  I'm going to have to put a beekeeper suit on.  Let's bring the EMT guys in.  I want to see some of the dangers involved.  You guys can hang out.  Just go to the back wall for a little bit.  We don't have many mics, that's why.  Here they are.  Here are the EMT guys.  They're outside the studio almost every morning to say hi to us.  And now we finally need them.  Our buddies.  Anytime we need them, they are here to help out. 
[01:34:30]  Never a dull moment with you boys, I got to say.  No, and they have been there for all the fun things.  They were there at the Hard Rock.  Remember the Hard Rock when someone suggested...  What was the really bad suggestion that we knocked down?  Somebody wanted to swallow a knife.  Yeah, a guy wanted to swallow a knife.  Oh, yeah.  For St. Paddy's Day.  And we were dead set against that.  And these guys kind of confirmed that that was a real stupid thing to do.  So we just had a guy piss his pants.  Which is harmless, good harmless fun. 
[01:35:00]  We had a drunk come up on stage and piss his pants in front of hundreds of people.  What else have you guys been involved with, with us?  Oh, Jesus.  55-gallon drum challenge.  That's right.  Were you the ones that dragged the one girl out on a stretcher?  Yeah, the one that got the cockroach in her ear.  Nice.  She got a cockroach in her ear, and they couldn't get it out with their equipment there,  so she had to be brought to the hospital.  Now, the fun part of that was, it wasn't just a cockroach in her ear.  She had been in the bottle, in the drum for quite a while. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  And we had been dumping cow blood on her and all kinds of disgusting stuff.  So as these guys are taking her down in the stretcher, she's covered in blood.  It looked like she had been just stabbed hundreds of times.  The building was horrified.  People were horrified.  Horrified.  Yeah.  But they took her down there and pulled it out of her ear.  And, you know, New York being a wonderful city.  Nobody just, no, it's this stalking look.  Got a gawk.  The maniacal look of madmen.  If there were camera phones back then, it would have been a lot, a lot of pictures.  So the beekeeper's suits or whatever are coming. 
[01:36:00]  The one guy has some spray that could calm the bees down if he gets too crazy.  No, it kills them.  Kills them on contact?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Zyklon bee just seems to calm them down.  Yeah.  Good one.  And these guys are telling us they're not allergic,  but let's say they have an allergic reaction.  That's why you guys are here.  Yeah.  Airway will close up.  They'll swell up, itching.  A whole lot of fun stuff.  The airway closes up.  The airway closes up.  An allergic reaction, the airway closes up, and that's why we're all concerned. 
[01:36:30]  By the way, any of you boys allergic?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Now, that's what I meant to ask.  We're all worried about the contestants.  How about you guys?  Does this, do you build up an allergy over time,  or if you're not allergic at eight, will you maybe be allergic in your forties?  No straight answer to that.  It could change almost overnight.  It could just change.  You don't know.  Do you have stuff with you?  Yeah.  What do you got?  Show us what you got.  Got some epi.  Show us the tools of the trade.  Got the epi.  You got the pen thing?  Cardiac monitor, we got, not the pen thing, we go direct for the IV drugs. 
[01:37:00]  I was given a pen thing, because I had a really bad allergic reaction to,  I think, I guess it turned out to be chickpeas or hummus or something.  And I was in the emergency room.  You were stung by a chickpea?  The hell does that even happen?  And then I went to an allergist, and they wanted to give me one of these pens that you  stab yourself with.  Wow.  You have to stab yourself with it violently.  Yeah, it's a harpoon.  Oh, my God.  It's like a harpoon.  Dude, they got the paddles.  You got the paddles?  Yeah.  The cardiac monitor.  Nice.  The whole nine job.  Can you fire those babies up or what? 
[01:37:30]  Hey, that's the finale.  That's the finale.  Rise up to take the paddles to the balls.  What would happen?  I don't think he's looking for a new job.  Only before you do it.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What would happen if you took the paddles to the balls?  Not good.  Not good?  Not good at all.  You can't even joke about that.  I hear if you do it, you do have to put the paddles and yell queer instead of the normal  clear.  Just kind of gay.  You know, I hear there are people that pay big money for that, too.  Yeah.  Wow.  Dropping in the tubes for the airway. 
[01:38:00]  Manage their airway if we need be.  All right.  And yes, all the technical individuals out there, there is a medic in the room before  you start getting all the phone calls.  Yeah.  It's not just some guy that bought this stuff on eBay.  Right.  I think I know how to use this.  Wow.  Great.  Oxygen tank behind me and a full drug kit.  All right.  I start whipping out the needles, you know.  And an ambulance.  You got any puppies full of heroin?  Later.  Later.  Talk to me later.  Love that story.  Yeah, we'll get into that story after the break.  And a bambulance downstairs.  Bambulance.  Just in case we need a bambulance. 
[01:38:30]  Got a bambulance.  Just for shits and grins.  The little voice in our head wants to say something.  The little voice in your head, don't do it.  Don't do it.  Remember St. Pat's.  It's not like we're going to have this done in a church.  What do you mean?  Two wasps ass fucking in St. Pat's?  Three years.  Well.  Every once in a while, you've got to take that chance.  Every once in a while, you've got to take the chance.  Don't do it, boys.  Today, we rolled the dice.  Super ball.  Today, we rolled the dice. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Super ball.  Three years.  Dude, if something goes wrong in the company, we'll always stand behind you.  Way behind.

[01:45:00]  already that i've had this exact feeling i have today but uh it's it's been  cleared this has all been cleared opie and when what you know you when it's been cleared  stupid man nothing can happen you're a stupid man it's not like sex for sam was something that  had been done times before you're uh oh that's right it happened man it's not like everyone knew  about it oh they did it's not like it had sponsors oh oh it did this has been cleared by everybody 
[01:45:30]  everyone's signing release forms  it sounds way too familiar oh god i'm buying a house the only reason they accepted this is because  i'm sure they sold that shit out of it oh  well maybe they didn't have the heart to tell you guys that they're just not interested anymore  and this is their way of doing it like yeah go ahead do the you know i thought that exact thing  last night when i was going to bed i'm like what if they're playing us what if they don't want to pay 
[01:46:00]  out our contracts what if they really want to get rid of us but they don't have the heart to do it  face to face in an office and like they found out we're doing this and just said yeah let them do  well you know what i i don't think they're doing that and it's like i always say i mean my friends  at sirius i mean uh that's a great company and mel and those guys are are probably uh uh you know  you know howard a pioneer satellite radio and the uh collection of uh people he's bringing aboard  um great great talents second to none second to none and uh to tell you the truth i would be honored 
[01:46:30]  to go over there and uh work for sirius would you call howard your boss he would be why wouldn't i  i would actually walk in and go morning boss morning boss no name right sellouts let's go to  jeremy in jersey jeremy hello hey listen harvey kytel said you're gonna be okay you're gonna be okay 
[01:47:00]  yeah we need that clip today to make ourselves feel better uh ladies and gentlemen live from  washington dc it's elo i don't know what the most repulsive thing was was actually hearing  the word howard and my boss come out of all three of your mouths i did not say howard and boss  i was i here's the other thing i have never in my life seen more like preparation i saw an email  yesterday that said okay video the contestants signing the release burn me two copies of the

[01:48:30]  call the jock paranoia yeah we have that but you do have you can't blame us um really i remember  those moments as well with this show going on what you know 19 months or whatever the hell it's been  now yeah our show yeah i mean yeah i can think we're into our 17th moment when my phone rang i'm  like oh here we are again yeah of course see i'm from the school of thought that some of the more uh  tamer things that we didn't prepare for were more dangerous than the bigger things that 
[01:49:00]  we do prepare for like the tamer thing so what perhaps there was a little drinking going on  maybe a few liberties were taken with some of the females at the party we don't know  perhaps there's no video do you think there's video do you really think that if somebody was  drunk in this studio i would have taken them into where ron and fez's studio is right now and  fucked them never condom do you really think i would have done that never  bye mr logan this is too close to home all right elo elo thanks for the uh the support i guess

[01:51:30]  here's food and wine critic eric asimov with all the trendy pinot noir producers sprouting up in  california it's easy to forget one of the best possibly because it's one of the most familiar  calera wine company has been making pinot noir since the mid 1970s when josh jensen planted four  vineyards high up on mount harlan in monterey county a rugged isolated spot of chalky limestone  soil that pretty much remains the sole domain of calera each of the four vineyards mills jensen 
[01:52:00]  selick and reed has its own character and it's fascinating to taste them together for the subtle  nuanced differences that begin to show themselves after five to ten years calera has now planted a  fifth vineyard ryan and soon it will take its place alongside the original four calera also makes  an excellent chardonnay and viognier and some well-priced central coast wines but its single  vineyard pinot shine among california's best this is eric asimov of the new york times

[02:05:00]  the neckline around the collar of the suit i see now what what else about like wrist protection  or gloves or well you should be wearing gloves and if you didn't bring your gloves you know you're  i'm pretty much fucked you're pretty much i'm gonna pull my hands in the sleeves and rubber band them  shut yeah then actually the newer suits they may have a little elastic on the uh on the wrists  because i don't want them crawling up my arms or legs you definitely nobody does no one you guys  look really silly well yeah but you know silly but safe you look beyond silly why does that one have 
[02:05:30]  on there's one we anthony and i have little hats this is this is to be you're supposed to wear this  with a hat you put the hat on you're gonna bring your own hat a regular hat yeah stupid let's see  they've advanced they've but yeah because the bee could get in through that hat hole yes i don't like  that yeah it's i don't want that we're wearing the right one this looks like it's sort of like a park  ranger hat uh and it's got like screen all the way around it well and then this very flexible screen to 
[02:06:00]  the bottom of it that zips into the suit yeah well the pictures will be up on opian anthony.com  i like this yeah someone's got a roll video on this so i could superimpose huge giant bees invading  our studio tonight yeah japanese hornets yes get some japanese hornets okay i'm gonna do this  all right someone roll uh tape on this all right i'm waving them all around trying to get them off of  me okay ah ah ah oh that'll look good i have to do it in the background too because it would look 
[02:06:30]  silly if bees were only in your side if just me bees would love you too jimmy that's right we'll look  like assholes screw that how do you drink a beverage in your bee suit yeah i never thought of that what  if the beekeeper gets thirsty yeah you you have to plan ahead yeah you gotta drink and piss has to be  done beforehand before what if you have diarrhea and there's bees all over what if you have diarrhea  and you want to get blown what do you do how are you sure the bees are off of you before you take the 
[02:07:00]  suit off you should do it with a partner yes ah that's always good with a partner that makes it sexy  what are you doing back there checking for bees checking for bees that's it and gathering the honey  bees open that up let me scoop my hand and see if there's no bees on it yeah because i i always  anytime you see a beekeeper working i see it on like the discovery channel things like that there's  bees all over them and they don't seem to care and even it petrifies me yeah and and even if you know 
[02:07:30]  you don't have any bees on you anymore when you're driving home in the truck you think you still have  bees on yeah yeah yeah well thanks for bringing in the bee suits you guys i also brought you some uh these  are t-rex oh that was you oh that's you you crazy bastard these are uh these are rat snaps but they  one-handed and uh i want it oh it would really hurt dude how do you also there's also a mouse  would that break your finger no no it didn't no what i'm saying it it could it could it definitely 
[02:08:00]  would make sure you get a lot of meat in there you know i want to be brave enough to take one but  i don't know do you break your finger well i think i would go in with my hand that's the way you got  inside of the meat of your hand let me tell you something i i rested it i opened it and closed  it like slowly on my hand like on the like past the pinky where the bone is yeah just letting it rest  there it left like those little teeth indentations in my hand right it's got teeth like a bear trap well  you know the teeth uh it's so that if the rat or the mouse is not killed immediately he will be 
[02:08:30]  suffocated by the teeth so you know they're they're thinking so your uh your business is um like  pest control obviously but yeah but you would wear this bee suit if uh someone had a bee problem  uh actually we don't really do bee work but we like to have the suits handy you never know when  yeah you get a big hornet's nest on the side of the house in the summertime your kids are trying  to go in the pool and dad's got to dress up like this and go honey stay in the house i'll take care  of it just make a disaster out of the whole thing no the best thing to do is wear your beekeeper suit 
[02:09:00]  when your friends don't have them and then start rattling up the bees yes hey bees you look like  a bunch of faggots and you swat the nest how hysterical would that be to uh have a big jar  of bees right go to a park during a picnic and just release them in your bee suit that's right  where you find the invalid kid in the wheelchair and just throw the bees on them and you could stand  right there laughing at them because you have the bee suit on do you want to hear a tragic story  about a guy who uh i think it was a killer bee story it was a guy pushing his invalid kid which 
[02:09:30]  of course where i got that in a wheelchair oh no in a wheelchair and he pushed the kid into a ditch  by accident at a park or something accident and there was a whole killer bee nest in the ditch oh  and they swarmed up all over the little fella and the guy tried to beat them off of somebody had to  wind up running away so he leaves his kid in a wheelchair in a ditch being stung to death  well he fucking hightails it out of there oh that is horrible but that's not going to be some  insurance questions on the claim all right we got the bee suits ben are they done with the paperwork 
[02:10:00]  when are they going to be done with the paperwork it's time for video tape we've got to videotape them  signing the paperwork right saying they know what they're doing it's going to take a while we know  well actually we actually should be done pretty soon we just gotta we're moving faster now which one  because a lot of people are heading into work so they're gonna have to catch us on the replay i guess  i'm scared which one you wearing jimmy this one will that uh like a jumpsuit type thing is it a  jumpsuit yeah it's one will it fit over my clothing absolutely so i don't have to get naked in here 
[02:10:30]  in the studio again oh anthony stop it sometimes after the show me and jim you know we're not really  naked it's just a couple of hogs coming out for a peek why not i say don't make it bad all right  we're getting ready for super bowl they're videotaping the contestants as they fill out their  paperwork we should be underway very very soon yeah well it takes a while we want to make sure  everything see in the old days it would have just been run in the studio right do it big problem got

[02:19:00]  gonna try yeah you can i'm sure that net is nice and clean yeah guys hands filtering it  i'm not that crazy all right yet can we get the guys in here  the paperwork from washington is just fucking up our show today this is why i want to hold it  this shouldn't take an hour and a half to prepare for a stupid bit that's going to take ten minutes  here they are ladies and gentlemen sociopath number one all right and your name is steve 
[02:19:30]  you are steve oh this is the last minute guy from yesterday you're not allergic to bees right no i am  not what did they make you uh fill out uh just release a liability i hold you guys responsible  for nothing it's all on my own all on your own all on your own and they got you on tape saying that too  right yes they do this is the same thing as if you just did it at home on your own in your basement  pretty much yeah and uh that's laughing you laugh when a bee stings you why are you laughing ben 
[02:20:00]  jim just looks funny in his outfit you think drinking his starbucks  a beekeeper's outfit of course it looks ridiculous it's always good when there's a stretcher you know  outside the studio we've taken uh taken all the precautions that we should now um the bees  are not in the contraptions yet are they yeah how are we going to get them in the contraptions bill  uh the bees are not currently in the contraptions this is how it's going to work yeah uh there's a  safety gate between the actual unit that the balls are going in and the tube yeah you put the bees in 
[02:20:30]  with the gate on and you close the tube at the end and then they're going to put it on the balls and  when they're ready they're going to open the gate and the bees will come into the container with their  nuts yes because each one of you will have to blow into the tube to force the bee into the nutsack  region of the other man there's still a uh we have to figure out how we're going to get that  yeah we need a blower we need a blower all right and that's that's the ultimate challenge by the way 
[02:21:00]  hi steve look at this cocky guy this is rafael right sir i can tell this is rafael from connecticut  representing the ct yes rafael from connecticut started this whole uh ball bag abuse thing yeah  he suggested the mouse trap to the the nutsack yep he couldn't get down here in time so matt stole  your thunder and now that video is being downloaded all over the world like crazy rafael was not happy  about that so he challenged matt to a to a ball bag abuse to a super ball yeah to a super ball basically 
[02:21:30]  what did you bring in for your nutsack today i brought in a uh i call it the chomper the little spatula  that you pull back and just oh that's kind of interesting i brought some vice grips but they  said it was too dangerous i brought the glue traps in they shot the glue traps down they will not let  us do the glue traps why they shot them down what's the i want a reason i didn't get a reason uh i'm  let me let me play devil's advocate because they can rip your ball skin off i will not when the problem 
[02:22:00]  is skin off i'm just saying that's probably what they're thinking it's just it's it's it's sticky  stuff it's like flypaper it would just remove hair i'm thinking yeah what else did they say no to uh  steve had brought a we work for a weird company it's like you can use you can't use you can't use glue  traps but you could uh get stung into balls by bees repeatedly over and over again that's okay but i  can't put my sack on a fucking glue trap it's pretty tough are you like when you guys bang chicks are you  into a girl like twisting your balls and stuff like that occasionally yeah okay all right see these guys 
[02:22:30]  see are you married girlfriend what does she think engaged what does she think uh she thinks i'm a  fucking lunatic yeah but right there but that's okay yeah all right but so what are you gonna do to  your uh nut sack you're gonna do this the spatula the spatula the mouse trap let's bring all the bees  out i'm ready for the ultimate challenge yeah um i was thinking about possibly dry shaving my sack  and then if you guys had icy hot we could apply icy hot oh another another brilliant scheme i thought 
[02:23:00]  of along with steve representing connecticut over here steve you're a connecticut kid too yes you know  each other no okay different ends of connecticut yeah my uh my my brilliant idea was for us to remove  our shoelaces and make one long string and tie it around my hog and his hog and possibly have jimmy  karate chop it now we didn't talk to them out there i don't know if the lawyers know about it or what  not but i would think that's going to be fun yes jimmy i'm afraid if i karate chop it someone's 
[02:23:30]  cock helmet will be ripped off and then i feel like a silly goose i think uh bounces off the floor  ends up in your mouth if they did want to do that a shoelace or a string or whatever between the  testicles with a line in the middle and have a tug of testicles and let's do it where where you each  then pull and the first one to pull the other one over the line with your balls uh wins let's do a  tuggo testicles we gotta let the let the lawyers know we gotta fill out new paperwork then maybe 
[02:24:00]  but let's do it yeah let's do tuggo testicles nobody wins hey wait is your uh fiancee here  she's right outside actually i want to hear the official blower because we need someone to blow  into the air too well he has his girl with him too all right perfect we got two blowers we'll be blowing  boy that takes the gayness right out of this doesn't it that's right yeah sure i was kind of uh all  right what else you guys got the tuggo testicles we like steve what are you gonna do  down my uh staple gun i was gonna do the old steve-o impression staple my nutsack to my leg 
[02:24:30]  but the lawyer said no why god only knows i thought you guys were on xm i mean i thought we could do  anything well they do have what's wrong with the staple gun uh to the leg mutilation maybe it comes  under the heading of mutilation i'm guessing i don't know oh they gotta let that through and they  were small staples i mean they were only uh quarter inch six millimeter not major ah so what are you  gonna do to your nutsack i'm gonna make a cup of tea i'm gonna tea bag a cup of hot water  wow that machine gets really hot too of course it does yeah jesus all right that's that's his 
[02:25:00]  special trick where's the uh third guy where's matt he's almost done he's still doing paper wow  the paperwork holy guys got here almost video confessions yeah these guys are fucking fearless  man unbelievable i'm watching them both talk about the things they're going to do to their testicles  very casually and if i was either one of you i'd be very psyched out by the other but neither one of  you are you're both like yeah let's do it no i'm ready to whip it out right now let's get something  in here let's start this let me get a mousetrap come on usually there's a lot of excitement in the 
[02:25:30]  studio but uh we can wait on that rubber bands yeah lovely to the testicles what you're gonna snap like  that oh he's snapping rubber bands like that all right i one time had a dominatrix and i'm not  into ball torture but she squeezed my balls a little bit a little tougher than i like it and  for a second i was like ah that was kind of hot so i can understand liking a little bit of pressure 
[02:26:00]  like to your balls no when you're banging do you want them squeezed how do you get twisted like i  wanted to bring the vice grips and and like one of the listeners called in earlier this week and  mentioned you know i i go one full rotation he goes tight i mean keep going this guy's the real deal  by the way yeah yeah i'll do it man i'm not i'm not here to play games i don't know much about steve  but rafael you're the you're definitely the real rafael's got his game balls on definitely  all right is matt ready to come in here can we at least talk to him and then he's getting his um 
[02:26:30]  blood pressure and everything finalized how'd you guys do on your blood pressure  pretty good yeah yeah low high what normal normal yeah all right who uh who said no to this steve  dc dc just called and said no to the testicle tug o war oh why now they're just shooting down  anything new now they're getting scared anything new now they're getting scared we had faith in them  down there tug of testicles opie what an event do you think that the lawyers when they got involved 
[02:27:00]  with a satellite radio and they're worried about fcc things ever thought they'd have to decide should we  let two men tie somebody to their balls and back up in opposite directions you know when you're  playing uh when you're doing regular tug of war there's like mud in the middle yeah it would have  been nice to get a gay guy or something waiting in the middle yeah i was an open asshole oh god 
[02:27:30]  all right no tug of test no tug of who's bummed great idea i am too i think we're all bummed xm shot  down anything electronic or electrical that's that's kind of a bum also i mean electric mousetrap  well the ultimate car battery come on car battery the ultimate challenge though the bees are you  guys worried a little about the bees those bees look like little faggots in the jar wow bring them on  little faggots in the jar he says oh look at this guy he's got a robe and everything matt wow look at 
[02:28:00]  he's like a tough guy that's a problem he's wearing a championship belt he's got the championship  belt on and everything how's it going boys what's up wow how's it going matt you are dressed for action  you're ready to go that doesn't even have to be here today because he's legendary already that  mousetrap video is yeah is being downloaded everywhere now everywhere it's amazing what the  hell belt is that what the balls it's the balls of steel championship belt he's wearing wow guys 
[02:28:30]  that's got to intimidate you a bit no huh no nothing we'll see all right matt what did you bring in  i brought a lot of stuff in but didn't get cleared well what didn't get cleared uh rat trap yeah right  you're gonna do the rat trap to the balls yeah i was gonna uh i brought a vice in it didn't get  cleared no vice like uh sort of like clothes pins but a lot tighter uh not clear no no clamps yeah  something afraid of crush trauma uh the hell bengay got cleared i got wax strips oh so you're gonna 
[02:29:00]  wax your nut sack and then slap yeah yeah it's like glue traps yeah i have glue traps i brought in  they didn't allow that all right but waxing your nut sack you can do that's got to be brutal that  could be a nice wow that okay that's a good one competition that's a good one waxing the nut  sack and then got allowed yeah ben gay on it ben gay yep i got ben gay also you that's gotta hurt  how about all right now we got to organize what we should do is uh come up with a list of events  they have to do i'm thinking of the wax strips first yeah they all have to do a wax strip and 
[02:29:30]  immediately uh apply some icy hot yeah and then uh how about what else gay was shot down what else  did you bring in matt but we're using ben producer i have a weird question about the ben gay yes  will that prevent the bees from going on it will that freak the bees out wow good question don't  want to sabotage no the grand finale that might fuck the bees up dude they may get sick it might  be like i think it's gonna make them just go nuts well they wouldn't it's only gonna be in between 
[02:30:00]  rounds and wash their balls like the bees may stay away from the sack yeah it may be a repellent  it's just something to think of oh my god but we need the ice might after they do the wax strips that  would be very uncomfortable all right so we start with wax strips what else did you bring  in matt uh ben gay all right so i'm thinking help me out guys also regular mouse traps i brought about  six of those in yeah i think they they all have to do a mouse trap to the scrotum do we start with  that uh yeah that seems to be it's technically somebody already did one i'm not going to mention 
[02:30:30]  any names so uh we can do that all right so we're going to start with a mouse trap they all have  to do a mouse trap to the scrotum to start the competition right then i'm thinking wax strips is that  good yeah all right huh cup of tea well then that'll be the freestyle yeah that's the team  competition yeah and then we get freestyle then we got freestyle so where you each get to show your  individual talents i'm thinking mouse trap wax strips ben gay after the wax strips if that  fucks up the bees we'll wash them you know we'll have them wash up and stuff i know trust me i stop 
[02:31:00]  myself wash your balls no i did not say that now they're gonna use you saying that we have to fight over who  washes who yeah raphael so then it's the ben gay okay any other any other uh are we doing piercings  or any of that crap today i don't i don't think so all right no punctures though okay yeah no punctures  seems to be the rule of the day except if it's you know a bee stinger right okay so what else can we  do we got mouse trap wax strips ben gay what about that slap thing and the rubber band well that i think 
[02:31:30]  that's his freestyle freestyle you're gonna do the spatula right yes all right so i guess we do one  two three freestyle and then the ultimate challenge i think we're pretty good very good mouse trap on  sack only no nuts jesus well we know that these notes are coming in like crazy we know that there's  a lot of panicky peats we've done the mouse trap before we know do you realize that somebody spent  all those years in law school and has to say should we allow the mouse trap to close on the ball itself 
[02:32:00]  and they're going on just the skin just the skin and possibly the vein i went to school for 12 years  i know that uh that's as far as we should go wow 500 people in the jesus right now looking for this  um then if you could slowly because if you move quickly it fucks up grab that camera from up there  500 people yeah we're gonna set up the pal talk uh camera in a better position we got a two cameras  uh shoot happening in the studio so we'll have video up online yeah lots of video so are we done 
[02:32:30]  with are we not is there anything else that we're not thinking of  no then we got to go freestyle so so rafael you're doing what's called what the chomper the chomper  all right he's doing the chomper anthony's setting up the camera  right steve what's your freestyle bit i'm making a cup of tea with my nuts that's right steve cup of tea with  nuts of tea oh boy i don't know what my freestyle is all my stuff is taken now with nuts yeah that's 
[02:33:00]  a problem what could matt do um he can go sit in the corner while the big boys play oh the smack  talk oh or the sack talk this guy has to prove he can take one first i already took it  yeah matt might not have to do freestyle because he's the one that uh came in here already we'll  figure something out for matt in new york city i'm sure i'm sure matt could find something to rip off 
[02:33:30]  from one of us and uh you know oh i love the smack talk on here uh-oh love the smack talk well we can  brainstorm we can figure something out by the time we get to matt maybe we'll have how about  you have to let master poe kick you in the balls a few times i think he wants to yeah  how about how about matt has to drink a cup of my cum oh oh my god that raises this to a  different competition this really is sexiest i was gonna say it just got hot 
[02:34:00]  well this is the real deal though raphael is really pissed off that matt stole his  thought he's a problem not puerto rican no i know as soon as you walked in i realized i  might judgment error all right let's go to uh pat in boston pat  hey i just want to know if uh these guys did any pre-game did they get a bunch of loads out are they  holding loads in for three days what's the story yeah what was the pre-game all about about you  guys how do you guys prepare save it i broke my finger so i can feel the pain you he did break his 
[02:34:30]  finger how do you break your finger actually work oh okay what kind of work do you do uh construction okay  all right i guess we're ready yeah absolutely should we take a break and then uh set up the  studio we'll be ready to go and the festivities will start do we have like uh some dramatic music  and all that super ball thursday i think we need uh some of that nfl music or something maybe some  acdc all right we'll figure something out after the break it's super ball thursday yes and uh oh my 
[02:35:00]  it's gonna get crazy in here the amt's guys are in here and they're ready to jump in if they have  to uh what about the bees have they been transported to the uh apparatus yeah how is that going  where are we gonna do this uh right in that little studio right there right in uh right in this studio  huh mr fancy pants i see you do it over there by oh point on he's gonna why not hope you do it pick  them out by hand and just throw them in the tube yeah you laugh at bees i do laugh at bees where the 
[02:35:30]  where are the faggots yeah what are you doing without your hat on i don't know the bees aren't  going to come out until i don't know this radio show it's fucking 9 30 bees will be brought out at  10 56. why would i wear that it's uncomfortable when you just want to look good until you have to  yeah the girls on pal talk want to see me the complaints are flying in just like the nfl where  they take off their helmets to look good on the sideline that's what jimmy's doing right now  no this is staying on no it bothers my head it itches like the ear thing gets pressed down with 
[02:36:00]  the hat i don't like it sorry that's all right uh fuzzy numkin calling again fuzzy yo what up boys  what's up yo you got the sequence all wrong check it out all right first you got to slap the mouse  trap yeah then you got to do the wax yeah then they'll be like nice and fresh and red and open  then you got to do the bees then to top it off you hit it with the bengue yeah but then that messes  up the ultimate challenge yeah well it has to end with the bees yeah yeah but then the anti gets  up the ultimate challenge becomes can you get the bengue on your balls after the bee sting 
[02:36:30]  i thought of that too but not for the same reason you're thinking i thought of it because  if the beat will it deter the bees from stinking we've already seen nathaniel took it i don't think  it will though i mean if if it did people would be saying hey bengue keeps uh bees away well no one's  probably ever been put in that position where they put bengue like how many old people are outside  and getting stung they put all people get stung all the time i love to see that  bees all over them right right on his joints where that fucking bengue is arthritis yeah 
[02:37:00]  nothing happens because they got the leather skin the stingers are just breaking in half they're not  penetrating anything all right fuzzy thanks brother all right now we got to do the bees last yeah yeah yeah  yeah all right i'm a little concerned like jimmy is but it has to be last okay i think it'll be all  right like we said we'll be more than happy to go in and wash your balls for you i think it'll be okay  too after that jimmy will get in and lather them up real good why does jim what he why is it we and 
[02:37:30]  then jimmy will get in and i hope he's got to dry them and uh i got the bee suit on i can't do  shit all right these guys will wax like one side of their ball bag so the other side is uh ready for the  bees just in case the bank just in case they still have uh they still have an area to go to  yeah all right super ball thursday begins next we're gonna go into game mode today don't worry  we're gonna have a fun show all right let me up that's hot i got blood rushing in my mule right  now that is so hot hey look at my cock waka waka penis boing boing boing insta boner something

[02:51:30]  there in an hour so he stole this kid's thunder yeah so rafael really pissed off and this is  and now we have this competition called super bowl it's going down it's going down down in here and  you're on a camera by the way we're doing a whole pal talk thing there's a ton of people with their  webcams checking us out right now right on and they're they're just uh staring at you and your uh  bee outfit so how do you feel man how do you guys feel about this man just do it any thoughts  there's like one bee in there waiting for your ass they are so pissed i can't believe how much 
[02:52:00]  they've come alive these uh bees uh one thing i want to know there are two apparatus and three guys  uh what's the difference with these guys those are the ones that didn't quite make it into the uh  apparatus yeah they kind of got loose and we were able to catch i want to know who there are two guys  uh three guys and two apparatus who's gonna get sloppy seconds no way on the apparatus see that seems to be  the part that uh it has these guys flustered i'll tell you what i'll take one of the jars put some  bees in there throw some tape on it i'll throw my balls in the jar so all three of us can go at once 
[02:52:30]  yeah well someone's got what about the wasps uh i think there's a wasp in there somewhere where's  the wasp at there's a whole combination of things in there they're all they're fighting they're they're  willing to here's how these guys are here in case one of them have a heart attack or something  yeah or in case me or anthony do they need the uh they're emt guys they need some of that  shit where you get so your throat don't close up if you're allergic they're right there there's  a possibility that one of these dudes could die yeah yeah see yeah that seems to be the problem here 
[02:53:00]  you mean foam coming out the mouth and all of that the whole deal man yes yes yes tracy gets it  all right what are you dudes might die man this is what a way to start this is the real dude tracy  of course i know all right really yeah anthony i think we're ready guessing jimmy i don't know  tracy we came up with a couple things they have to do before the that's called the ultimate challenge  what you're looking at in front of you okay uh want to adjust the webcam yep first of all they 
[02:53:30]  got to take a mousetrap to their nutsack go old school where are the mousetraps  is it mousetraps or mice traps right mouse traps i think it's mousetraps even though it doesn't uh  because each trap is for a mouse traps is pluralized not mouse very good jimmy thank you thanks jim  all right the camera's now on the contestants yep what's gonna happen is anthony you gotta like work  the camera like where do you want them to stand when they're doing their thing well ideally like it 
[02:54:00]  was last time we got the best shot from where jimmy is but you know we got more people in here and  jimmy's here so we move the camera just a little closer now we got no more slack left in the line  really uh we wouldn't get more than another inch or two closer and that really won't make much of a  difference once you move the honeybees the two remaining ones out of the way you just slide you  want to you want to move tracy over there and then the guys where we were last time for this ant  tracy could just move over there for this part we we could do that we can do these guys no you'll 
[02:54:30]  be on that side just grab that mic okay grab that mic all right because we want a uh a close-up  for the the folks at home yeah keep the bees off my latte all right now we're i guess where bill  is would be uh ground zero for this whole thing looks like the best uh shot right there bill is setting  up the mousetrap this is super ball thursday on the opian anthony program are they going all three  at the same time or one at a time one at a time this one one at a time all right so uh rafael from 
[02:55:00]  connecticut he's stepping up to the mousetrap rafael you know we you got to move the ultimate challenge  away the apparatuses just to get a better camera it's a little in the way a little in the way we need  help here guys i can't broadcast and and and organize at the same time choreograph this whole  thing oh geez he's putting them near me ha i am getting the heebie-jeebies so bad looking at those  things all right mousetrap is set i think we can move the camera slightly closer no uh no we're we're 
[02:55:30]  pretty much we're we're there all right close as we can get it and we got two cameras rolling just in  case two different angles okay here we go this is rafael from connecticut hold on one second can you zoom  it all in i think you have zoom power with the camera digital zoom it's stay try it one no it's  good i think it's good because we got a close-up for later on for uh opanthony.com this is at least  good enough for once it's not bad all right yeah keep it like that all right here we go rafael  whenever you're ready now remember here's how it's got to be done rafael you have to take your bag 
[02:56:00]  and stretch it out yeah matt did this perfectly you stretch it out stretch your bag out and make sure  it's only your sack that is going to be whacked by that thing make sure push your testicles back  so it's only bag skin that is being hit you don't want to hit a nut you just want sac skin yeah this  is pretty gay there's like 25 guys in here and one female oh come on man go ahead and pull your  sack out of this morgan's here let's see this should go down yeah tracy morgan may is the whole thing 
[02:56:30]  all right here we go rafael he's got a sack out it's stretched out and here we go we're filming  this for opanthony.com whenever you're ready rafael from connecticut wow he's ready for another  go for two set it up what a professional what a moment for sport i can't believe he's going  for a second mouse trap people dude don't even no one gives a about your junk trust me don't worry about 
[02:57:00]  wow we got a second trap set and ready to go he's going for two uh oh misfire misfire okay rafael's  still got the mouse trap bill's trying to set the traps bill's shaking what's the matter bill rafael  still has the mouse trap attached to his uh ball bag of course he does and uh bill is just having a real  tough time reloading he's got the uh left uh give me the side of his sack in a mouse trap i believe and 
[02:57:30]  he's going to go for the right nut hit a nut now here we go here's a second one from rafael  a dual hit on the mouse we didn't see this coming anthony we're going for two  son of a bitch two mouse traps oh my rafael from connecticut kicking off this competition and  true professional style unbelievable two mouse traps no one saw that coming  wow let's get one on my taint unbelievable what a kickoff what a kickoff to this super 
[02:58:00]  ball come on give me another one well where would you i gotta find some more skin i gotta find some  more skin where would you fit a third here show show the webcam show pal talk don't move don't move  wow jesus oh dude you're loading up a third mouse trap all right i got a third mouse trap  i'm heading you know in the world of professional sports it's moments like this will be the unexpected 
[02:58:30]  things that happen that show the true professionalism that's what's history by the  way who's judging who's judging this judging what's the fucking judge well let him just do this but i mean  in the end oh in the end how do we pick a winner yeah i have no fucking uh he is now trying to find  more skin he's he's pulling at different parts of his bag i think on the left side he's fine i  found a little more perhaps you can squeeze it into the corner of the trap it's all ball though make  sure you push that no balls mike no ball just get skinned that's delicious skin there it is he found 
[02:59:00]  some skin he's gonna have to go for the corner i think uh not gonna be able to dive straight  forward into this one opi he's gonna have to come in on the corner all right uh with uh with  his ball bag you want me to push this forward a little bit hitting the detonator he was talking  about your cock hey jimmy you want to hold this push this forward all right here we go rafael's  going for a third mouse trap come on third one all right let's shh here he goes balls like right  there he's trying yeah watch that testicle yeah protect the testicles here he goes here we go the 
[02:59:30]  third one oh oh oh my god three three mouse traps on his ball unbelievable wow i wish i had more skin  i'd keep going but i'm sorry it is just a lack of a scrotal skin opi that is keeping him from putting  even more traps on there i have not seen professionalism like this in sport in years 
[03:00:00]  this motherfucker should join the marines or something anthony it's kind of weird i kind of  like the pain man do you i like it yeah uh could you not look me in the eye like that when you say  that it's almost like an offer sitting there my balls sagging it off all right let's hear for rafael  from connecticut rafael what a kickoff on uh this super ball thursday six uh wow that is really  going to be hard to beat not only uh mousetrap to the nutsack but a second and then a third mousetrap 
[03:00:30]  right this is going to be hard to beat ladies and gentlemen uh other contestants are you nervous by the  initial uh the kickoff here by rafael three mousetraps how do you compete i'm sure i have enough  sack for four he believes this is something we didn't expect i'm absolutely crying over here  just being witness to this is fantastic it certainly is tracy any comments so far man i have no comment  on this man these dudes are super freaks man this is unbelievable free this is like watching ali and 
[03:01:00]  liston uh this is like watching the uh 69 uh mets in the world series again it's like watching uh the  mets uh uh beat the red sox it's just a moment in sport that i'm gonna say where were you when uh  they snapped three four mousetraps on their bag and i'm gonna say i have no idea i was drunk  unbelievable day for sport there's actually i have a bet with one of the emts he said they won't make  it through the mousetraps i'm like dude you have no they're gonna make oh yeah this is nothing 
[03:01:30]  emts were doubting one mousetrap and we've seen three we have four loaded mousetraps here you had  better have a huge sack my friend all right now we got four traps we got steve from connecticut  stepping up to the let me tell you something steve has an advantage rafael was uh uncharted  uncharted territory with three mousetraps obi he can now look and see and pick and choose where  he wants to snap that first trap allowing maybe more skin for the subsequent uh traps that will come 
[03:02:00]  i think going second a very good strategy here all right here we go steve is stepping up to the  mousetraps here he goes uh not afraid and he's not shy to show not shy not afraid where's that first  one going look obi in the face he's pulling as much yam bag over exposing as much of the right  side of his sack as he can he's starting on the right side i believe working right to left right to  left here we go here he goes detonation number one close to you goose  oh there it is he's got a mouse trap on the left side of his bag he's pushing over 
[03:02:30]  obi's not even taking a second next trap lining up didn't even blink i do think he's going to be  able to get two traps on that left side of his bag leaving the right side completely open for at  least two more at least two more here we go steve from connecticut going for the second mouse fantastic  fucking steve he's shaking are you all right yeah he's stepping up to the mouse trap one fell off i'll  do it again no biggie uh-oh it's one fell off wow wow now now you like this maybe you should uh break 
[03:03:00]  out the rat traps you will have to have four hanging in order to beat that three yeah here he goes having  a really tough time keeping that nut out of there and getting enough bag he is shaking he's all ball this  kid you know right now i believe he's probably wishing he just got out of a warm shower where  you have that great turkish tapping consistency to your yam bag which is perfect for this type of  a competition oh there it is back in on the left side it is hanging uh that must stay now that is uh 
[03:03:30]  the second one's coming up all right this is you know the studio was a little chilly today and that  could uh inhibit uh the number of mouse traps he gets in there but as he goes on he's warming up there  two two traps on his yam bag and now his uh the other side of his yam bag completely exposed and  open ready for number three room he's got plenty of room i love how these guys are shaking mousetrap  how's it feel so far steve it doesn't hurt at all this is bullshit oh wow you see that's professional 
[03:04:00]  oh god damn it holy shit fucking he's going for number four he's going for four he's going for four  this is a record yes four three was a record one was a record here he goes number four my god this  is a new record oh my god opie opie four mouse traps are hanging from his yam bag i've seen it all  i've seen it all where's the camera you know i've seen some things in my day there it is right there 
[03:04:30]  right there no dude there's the camera right in front of you i'm trying to see if i can fit one more  oh my god stop it let's see if we can do this i think go for it opie i've seen nirvana in a small  club uh that's nothing compared if he does five uh five mouse traps where do you think you're going  to fit this one sir yeah where where how much skin do you have there are you going underneath he's going  way over to the right hand side pulling some bag from underneath up into the right hand side my god 
[03:05:00]  he's finding bag where there shouldn't be bag what are you unbelievable arabian he has found more  bag yeah he's under i think he's pulling up loose taint skin all right here he goes if he gets five  traps here we go number five oh my god oh one fell off but he did have five he had five no no it's not  all right this is not official they're waving it off come on you're saying it wasn't a catch you 
[03:05:30]  said he didn't have long enough you never had complete control of the mouse let's go load it  again load it again bill take those never had complete control of the mouse trap with his scrotum  how are the bees doing by the way they still moving around they're probably watching wondering where they  fit into this no shit like what we gotta do all right we're going for five again here's steve from  connecticut it's super ball thursday and nose that forward a little there you go here we go 
[03:06:00]  number five make sure it stays on oh he's shaking you know somebody just used to start to hold it in  place somebody hold it for me he'll just hold it okay fine i'll get that just hold it there all right  he's going for five hold on take your time oh there it is five traps are on this guy's bag unbelievable  wow hey wait a great this is going to be a ball bag that goes down in history we got to kill half  a mouse baseball team we got to go we got to go to jim in wisconsin jim yeah there's a little 
[03:06:30]  controversy here somebody ought to check for some performance enhancing drugs have a nice day all  right we will be checking for some type of steroids or uh performance enhancing uh drugs uh you know to  see uh five mouse traps like that sure the crowd enjoys it the people love the competition but what  is it telling the kids if uh they're using drugs and a normal person you know can't get any more than  maybe two on there you're getting five i'm a little suspect here but i'm not going to ruin this fine day 
[03:07:00]  for sport by bringing up this maybe an investigation later maybe something but uh right now i'm in just i'm  just enjoying the competition which is fantastic it's anyone's game at this point anyone's game  steve and rafael both very impressive when i think i was stunned at three traps opie three traps  and uh this gentleman five traps no way to beat it i just don't see enough skin hey kids don't try this  at home very good you are a role model you certainly are to say all right matt is stepping up 
[03:07:30]  matt comment anything did we lose tracy morgan already where did tracy go  he left us yeah what oh he's over there what happened to tracy why is he outside was he laughing  hysterical at white guy cock yeah probably it i know black guys can get five on each side of the bag  interesting underwear yeah nice fucking silk i guess maybe he doesn't want it jesus christ i guess 
[03:08:00]  he doesn't want to get arrested maybe maybe that's it he's got some things he's worried about separating  himself from all right matt is uh matt any uh what are you going to do to beat these guys  i'll let my cock do the talking right now do you think you could get more than than five traps  what's your cock going to say besides ouch he's uh really searching for uh the proper skin placement  now that seems to be very important now it's all about the numbers all right here we go uh you can't 
[03:08:30]  just go into this and snap the trap here's matt from new york city oh there's one oh jesus man  that's gotta hurt you're kidding me that has gotta hurt wow all right he's going for number two  anthony you want to move that a little closer yeah you can move the trap don't be such a goose  that's good yeah it's all you any technique any style uh wow he's stretching that out like a full  mouthful oh i lost the mouse trap he lost the uh first mouse trap that's a tough one he'll get it back 
[03:09:00]  on that one's got to go back on sir yeah please all right stop cheating he's going for number one  again oh my god oh two traps sprung but well that's just barely hanging from uh  uh he hit his hand from his sack he has a broken hand he just he does have a broken hand which again  shows opie the courage of the competitors here today broken hand and all and uh that didn't  stop him he's here for super ball uh a real trooper there's number two there's two again he got 
[03:09:30]  that he keeps getting his broken hand yeah he's got two on his yam bag but his finger hurts when he  gets that slammed in there figure that i don't know how this guy is wired but uh very uh good  like i said earlier he's got a very good hubba bubba shoot hubba bubba consistency to his yam bag  which i think will really help him get those numbers up and here goes number three matt from new york  city super ball thursday he's out of camera range by the way that's all right that's all right there you  go there we go there we go all right he's got three hanging he's got three three are hanging from uh 
[03:10:00]  his yam bag how's it feel matt it feels good he's he's digging it all right he's going for number four  number four is believable loaded and ready to go it hurts yeah i don't doubt it there you go it does  hurt oh there's four he still has some skin left good placement good strategy yeah you know some 
[03:10:30]  people just think this is about slapping your ball bag in a mousetrap and taking the pain opie but there  is a true strategy here as to where you're placing these mousetraps on your yam bag and i see as he  goes for five mousetrap number six loaded and lined up and i believe a very optimistic bill is loading  up trap number seven you're insane bill you're insane it ain't gonna happen not this year matt from  new york city going for the fifth mousetrap hanging it was way over way over the side uh wow he is really 
[03:11:00]  hard to keep into a camera he's struggling he's moving side to side he's looking to see if he has  room for six anthony room for six six would be a a new world record this is something i have never  seen before and i i i gotta you know it's a moment i want to tell my grandchildren about  here he goes it's a moment they would love to tell their grandchildren about attempting the world record  he's actually reaching back and pulling asshole skin to the front yeah here it is 
[03:11:30]  a new world record  he's going for seven anthony he's going for no way no way not seven  and do i see mousetrap number eight waiting on deck there can't i i refuse to believe this is even  possible the only thing that's going to stop this kid is lack of skin that's right it's going to stop  him lack of skin the drive here we go number seven that's a tough spot he's picking  over there yeah i don't i don't know about this to the ball i think he's gonna have to go more for 
[03:12:00]  uh a part of the upper penile skin and uh lower penile skin upper yam bag skin it's still officially  nutsack but it's getting a little a little too close he's rifling through these like a janitor looking  through his keys oh my god wait do we have one that fell yes oh my god it's only six still only six  i thought we were seeing history in the making we still have a world record in front of us yes  oh it snapped on bill's hand all right like that really hurts after watching this have you found 
[03:12:30]  any uh open real estate you think matt he's just concentrating matt yes another problem with this obi  is uh finding the skin you keep pulling thinner and thinner layers of skin out because so much is  taken up by the previous traps which makes it even more painful all right here we go get it set  let's go number seven yeah he's hurting stop taking your time bill wait wait get on camera because  this is uh for yeah here we go another world record hold on stop iming me you motherfuckers 
[03:13:00]  i can't see the goddamn camera what are they saying wait wait wait hold on matt we're trying to get  you on camera uh on pal talk camera okay you're on camera again he's been moving around like crazy  anyone im's me they get banned here goes number seven  yeah hold the back of the trap yeah please bill bill it's not gay yeah it's not at all hold it with  your chin it's not gay all right he's going for seven seven mouse traps no oh no i don't think it's 
[03:13:30]  gonna happen it ain't happening he said it's not happening but give him one more chance he got three  attempts give the kid another chance i think he got three attempts someone's on the phone going could you  imagine if ben played this game yeah he's going for 47 he'll never make it you know those containers  you see on on your way to jersey the shipping containers you need one of those filled with  mousetraps for ben all right all right we're trying to give him one more shot at seven mousetraps yeah 
[03:14:00]  we're going to stop at seven the last uh the last shot he's going to get at this right at the edge  bill just hold the back of the trap for the guy so he can set his world record yeah  but did they tell you know bruce jenner not to uh uh attend the uh final uh part of his  oh wait is it official there is only six it's just a skin issue but six is the record sir  that is more than respectable six mousetraps all right unbelievable day

[03:20:00]  who else is here you watch both are he's here i don't think some people take this sport seriously  you're right they look at it like it's a game like it's some kind of a joke we're going to  instead of a true sport we're going to the celebrity bullpen by the way we lost tracy  we got to take him out of the game we got ari coming in from the sopranos oh wow yeah i'm kind  of scared to come in this room yeah it really is nasty that is something to watch does it just 
[03:20:30]  reek like awful sex in here it probably does it smells like a wait a minute you're from dog  sees god i'm from dog i thought they said you were from the sopranos you were on there i was also on the  sopranos what were you on the sopranos i was meadows college roommate yeah i pulled out my hair  remember the crazy girl i was crazy yeah yeah that was actually a really good not as crazy as these  guys but you know hey yeah i don't always wear this by the way it looks very becoming on you you should 
[03:21:00]  wear it all the time something i come in with on thursdays it looks good thank you it looks really  all right so what do you got to do to wax this off we're running out okay so basically warm it up in  hand apply uh really firm and i guess they're ripping it off yeah okay yeah yeah i think all  three of them should do at the same time because you have enough and time issues no i think no one  at a time you want to get the reaction we need reactions that's why you're still an intern bill  that's right are you are you offended by male nudity or anything i love male nudity all right  very good and tracy morgan doesn't by the way and ari is making it less gay thank god yes we needed 
[03:21:30]  a female finally a lady is a little homoerotic in here it's a little yeah a little i think why  add the word erotic it's just homo yeah two men in beekeeper outfits with erections  yeah do they look ridiculous ari no it's good it's a look well i got a little beekeeper hat for my  head all right we're running out of show i'm telling you uh yeah guys now that there's a lady in here  uh you can't be shy uh you're gonna have to slap that out yeah come on don't be all right just do

[03:25:00]  stage of super ball thursday and remember people at home don't try this these are professionally  trained athletes that's right training for for uh minutes to do this you guys aren't going to make  me do anything like this well we're hoping we're hoping we only have let me tell you something  ari we only have one competition we've ever had the ladies do uh we haven't had it done in quite a  while and i really don't think you'd be up to it it is called the wiffle ball bat challenge uh see  the wiffle ball bat in that case up there it's protected in the glass case all right all i'll say 
[03:25:30]  is it's a special kind of lady that even tries to compete i'm sure that's yeah yeah yeah usually  they're uh strippers uh-huh um or some type of porn star that goes for that uh you could see their  notches and names yeah at various points on the bat which i think you can figure out why  it has a comment they weren't just drawing their names willy-nilly on that bat we want ari to hang  out a little longer so let's uh yes now uh are we done with the wax strips yes yeah that was the 
[03:26:00]  wax strip segment now icy hot applied right to where the wax strip uh pulled off whatever it pulled off  hair meat uh anything else this should be easy yeah they're gonna laugh at this i can't believe you're still  smiling let me go to robert in dallas robert yeah everyone's talking about how painful this  seems but it's so surreal i can't even imagine it it doesn't even affect me i'll have to see the  video or something you gotta see the video definitely this is video that will it's the 
[03:26:30]  fucking worst thing you've ever seen it's like it looks like it hurts more than the kennedy assassination  let's go to mike in jersey mike hey how you doing hey mike hey i had a quick suggestion yeah i was  thinking how about a zipper to the ball sack oh zipper to the ball sack oh that's oh that could be a  problem yeah oh no i don't think we'll see that oh boy that could be a problem that's enough someone  said that that last uh wax thing sounded like velcro it was being ripped it really did make a nice  came through loud and clear i believe yes all right here we go

[03:36:30]  share yeah they shared mousetraps yeah you shared mousetraps it's not gay believe me i think we  should roll the dice or something to figure out who goes first or something how about whoever yeah  paper rock scissors uh uh pulling straws what what do you want to do uh smallest cock i mean  how do you flip a coin with three people who has the edge i think my belt speaks for itself that i  should go last all right matt's that's good good point matt is the champion they're both pretty full 
[03:37:00]  dude there's yeah what do you want 80 bees or 74 on your balls who cares the only problem is um what  problem oh i think we should open it up and get the bees into the main container first just so because  this thing's hard to open the safety hatch and if they're doing it that way hey hey hey here's the  problem with that though uh once the bees are in there if they have a problem getting their bag in  there yeah before it gets sealed yeah there's gonna be some loose bees in here that's right bill  it's gonna be someone's responsibility to open that gate that's right i don't care what it takes 
[03:37:30]  i think balls go in first gate open second absolute good point and that's what happened at chernobyl  they open the gate first and put the balls in second now look get balls right in there  yeah do you want to just have uh rafael call heads or tails for who goes first here yeah let  rafael do it nathaniel what is it it's tails tails it is so fezz from ron and fezz everyone  very surprised that you're in the studio well i got here a little early today 
[03:38:00]  can i say finally great radio my god this is what the country has been waiting for super bowl every  single day is what i said as we had girls coming in here doing the wiffle ball bat challenge three  of them were up on the console where were you that day i don't recall that day but yeah i just happened  to get in here early to do some paperwork over some things with black girl just great show guys this is 
[03:38:30]  the best why are you pulling up a chair uh fezz why can't we do this every day don't you have show  prep to do or something oh fuck that show  all right well well i'm glad you're out you're enjoying it yeah this is the best what's next what's  what's coming up next here well we have the ultimate challenge this is the grand finale the apparatus full  of bees uh the guys will be putting their balls in that uh hopefully airtight rubber top and then a 
[03:39:00]  gate will be open releasing the bees into the chamber yeah and uh then they have to sit there until one  of them gets stung this was one of many prototypes we had to figure out an apparatus this is all nazi  technology i know one prototype was jimmy norton's mouth and uh that didn't work out too well yeah i don't  want to be the bees i don't want bees in my mouth well i'm glad we all had a laugh at my expense 
[03:39:30]  here we go wow i am i am now into the frightened portion of the show i've never had an anxiety  attack i think i'm having one yeah this is a little much getting a little freaked out why tracy left  yeah see but you're showing you have more balls than tracy morgan it's not gonna be  can handle this she's seeing more balls yeah that's true uh all right now how do we decide  is it who goes first or both the same time i think shouldn't it be both sequential or yeah okay uh 
[03:40:00]  you're you're going first rafael rafael it's up to you bro you look a little nervous now wait how do we  get him up higher for the camera can he stand on a box i'm not even kidding well the camera can the camera  be aimed no because he's thing because he's a little shorter so we want a little fella we want  to make sure we get this on camera that's all if i was in better shape he could stand on my back  all right we are adjusting the webcam that's good the apparatus filled with uh how many bees are in 
[03:40:30]  there seriously would you guess yeah a shitload 50 about 50 bees that's fine they're not gonna bother you  wait and we need the camera where we we see their faces i think too yeah raising it back up we could  still proceed here you don't bother them they won't bother you yeah we need to see their face  i might have to pull out then yeah pull out a little because we're getting video as well for  the websites that will be uh close-ups and all that crap we got a two camera shoot happening bill did  you just say whichever way is most comfortable none whichever way oh wait none way and we need a 
[03:41:00]  girl to blow into the tube i think they're pretty into the phallic tube i don't think you need to  see i think they're pretty angry who's gonna put their mouth by the tube here we go the ultimate  challenge we've been waiting five years to do this five years we finally found lawyers were stupid  enough to let us do this gentlemen take your balls out all right uh let's explain finally  rafael rafael has uh sticky balls sticky balls yeah they're sticky from the previous competition which
