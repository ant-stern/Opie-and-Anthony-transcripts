<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing the humorous potential of footage from a Seton Hall fire and listener-submitted clips of outrageous behavior during live news reports.  This segued into a sexually explicit discussion about Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera’s American Music Awards outfits, featuring graphic descriptions and jokes about their bodies.  A caller, John, contributed with explicit commentary.  The conversation then shifted to speculating about the future careers of Britney Spears and other celebrities, including the possibility of Playboy appearances, and featured the reveal of a long-running inside joke about a planned threesome with the Olsen twins upon reaching legal age, complete with a countdown.  They also mentioned an upcoming interview with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, planned for the next day, and detailed their plan to have two large police officers serve as bodyguards.

The hosts then launched into jokes about Cardinal O'Connor's large head, followed by several caller experiences, including one listener detailing how the show had consumed his life and another discussing receiving the "Demented World" CD.  The hosts promoted their own upcoming CD, mentioning setbacks with their record label, and played a song about Cuban refugees drowning.  A significant portion of the show focused on "Psycho Mark," a listener who repeatedly disrupted The Rock's MTV appearance with a "WOW" sign.  The hosts and callers discussed his antics with live updates.  A Daily News story speculating on a cross-promotion between the show and a WWF event was also mentioned.

A caller, Bridget, described a negative experience after following the hosts' advice to give her boyfriend a blowjob, detailing his violent reaction and insults.  The hosts and numerous callers offered support and advice, often using humorous and sexually explicit comments.  Listeners were encouraged to submit photos to an online gallery.  This discussion continued into a subsequent segment, focusing on Bridget’s recounting of her boyfriend’s violent reaction and insults after oral sex, resulting in a head injury.  The conversation became increasingly vulgar and sexually explicit, with speculation about Bridget's sexual history and a "Make Bridget Cry" game where callers insulted her with highly offensive and sexually suggestive remarks.  Bridget became emotional and hung up, later calling back, still upset.  The segment included advertisements for Paisano's Italian restaurant and a lengthy, humorous, offensively stereotypical Delta Airlines commercial parody, along with a caller, Paul, playing a UFO song, which sparked a comedic exchange.


Another segment featured caller Paul playing music the hosts considered "crap" (including Limp Bizkit and Pearl Jam), leading to a heated exchange with homophobic and other offensive language.  Numerous callers insulted Paul's musical choices and on-air behavior, with producer Rick being repeatedly targeted with homophobic slurs. Paul was ultimately locked out of the studio by Opie.  The discussion shifted to Hillary Clinton's political strategy, employing crude and sexually explicit language, and included a humorous "Big Willie Pop" advertisement parodying Bill Clinton.  The hosts discussed their upcoming encounter with The Rock, anticipating potential conflict, and revisited past bits and calls, including an old prank call to a hardware store, debating the originality of certain bits and accusing Howard Stern's show of stealing material.  The segment ended with a "What Did We Learn Today?" segment featuring more caller feedback and jokes, including a caller's anecdote about Jackie "the Joke Man's" loud and negative behavior at a restaurant.

The final segment featured listener calls recounting their day’s experiences.  Jackie shared stories of an annoying business traveler on a train and a lunch encounter mentioning Billy West being "screwed over." Another caller commented on the Howard Stern Show’s alleged dependence on Gary Dell'Abate. Rich received criticism for the show being a “copycat.” Steve recounted a humorous anecdote about "truck driver Paul" and "Rick," described as a "Puerto Rican John Travolta." Lisa commented on Opie's brother needing therapy and suggested almond oil for Anthony.  Jackie engaged in self-congratulatory discussion about a Letterman bit he wrote, criticizing Robin Quivers. Aaron reflected on the frustration of doing good deeds. Matt shared a darkly humorous observation about the financial value of a deceased elderly woman with a brain tumor, referencing a news story about someone freezing to death.  The show concluded with speculation and anticipation for The Rock's appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Reporters are doing live shots.  All the reporters are down at that Seton Hall fire today.  Yeah.  I mean, it's tragic, but there's a great opportunity there.  Oh, my God.  What?  Capitalizing on that.  Well, I'm just saying, you know, you see the TV crews in your neighborhood.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Get on TV with the wow sign.  Jump up and down like a lunatic-like psycho mark.  We're hoping to spawn more psycho marks.  And then we'll get the footage on the unofficial website.  We'll have a nice section on the unofficial website, people getting on TV with wow signs. 
[00:00:30]  So far, we've been on MTV, Anthony, and CBS.  We want to be on every single station before spring.  Every one of them.  Before spring.  Damn it.  And we want to be on all these stations many, many times.  We'll even have a contest and stuff.  We'll get enough of these, and then we'll have, like, the listeners vote for the craziest guy.  Yeah.  Making a fool of himself, you know, behind the reporter.  Oh, that was it.  Turn changing into comedy over there. 
[00:01:00]  It's cheating.  John, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  All right.  Hey, I got a question.  Did you guys watch the American Music Awards the other night?  I watched it for exactly 30 seconds, and that was when Britney Spears was on.  Oh, thank you, guys.  Is it me, or is she too young to wear that?  She's not too young at all.  She's 18.  Hey, let's just put it this way.  I'm sorry I missed the show yesterday.  I heard about the MTV thing.  I wish I had seen Psycho Mark doing it, but I was in my bedroom still recovering from Britney Spears, if you know what I mean. 
[00:01:30]  That outfit last night was unbelievable.  Oh, God, I was like, let's just put it this way.  My roof is still sticky.  Jesus Christ.  It's still sticky.  And then once I was done with Britney Spears, boom, Christina Aguilera comes on.  Yeah, the other little ho.  The other little ho is firing everything.  Let me tell you something.  I'm not into Aguilera.  I'm not into Jennifer Simpson as the new one.  I'm into Britney Spears.  And it's so funny because she sings all these cute little songs about having high school crushes on guys and stuff. 
[00:02:00]  And the reality is there's guys in their mid-30s just whacking it to the video.  Oh, God.  I got one question.  Do her, like, fun bags, like, sag just a little too much?  No, they're perfect because...  No, if you look at the dress, they would sag, and you have to admit that.  Oh, please, like you would complain.  Come on, John.  I wasn't really looking at the fun bags.  Check about six inches lower.  That's a different thing altogether.  Yeah.  There's a camel toe in the house.  All right, John.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Come on, man.  But you know that's the truth, you know?  She has all these, like, cute little high school crush videos and songs.  Uh-huh.  And the fact is...  There ain't a guy looking at her, doesn't matter what the age is, that wouldn't want to pounce on her.  Right, and that's all any guy's thinking when they watch those videos.  She's there with her cute little hat on and, you know, blah, blah, blah.  You want to see her rip open that shirt she had on?  Hell, yeah.  That little top she was wearing.  It's just a matter of time.  We just got to pray her career goes bad in two years and she'll be in Playboy.  Yeah, that's all you got to do is wait for them to become has-beens and then all of a sudden the Playboy offers a mill or something to pose. 
[00:03:00]  And there you go.  You got your naked pics.  You got to hope, you know, they become has-beens before they get too old, though.  Like maybe Anna Kornikova.  When she gives up tennis?  We can only wish.  Naked?  I think Britney Spears does it for me more than Anna Kornikova now.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think they're different.  There's a big difference between the two. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  I'm still waiting for the little Olsen twins to end up in Playboy.  Well, we're getting there.  That'll happen.  What's the countdown down at?  It's got to be what?  We have a countdown going.  Anna and I started this like, what, like five years ago, Anna?  Yeah, yeah.  Five years ago we did the when can we have a legal threesome with the Olsen twins.  And I believe they were 13 at the time.  No, I think they were younger at the time.  I think they're 13 now.  No, no, no.  They're up there. 
[00:04:00]  I think they're close to like 15 at this point.  Really?  Well, if anyone has that info.  Yeah, we need that today.  We need to check it off on our charts.  Hey, Pete, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  I just want to, I don't know if you know, but The Rock is hosting on MTV today.  Total Request Live.  Yeah, we do know that.  That's why we had the sneak attack yesterday with Psycho Mark, because we were thinking  maybe people would be on to us today.  Oh, there he is.  He's doing a promo.  I'm looking up at the croc.  The croc.  There's the croc.  Oh, you've got to go over there. 
[00:04:30]  Dwayne Johnson live on MTV right now.  The croc.  Is he being The Rock?  I don't know.  He looks like he's being The Rock for TRL.  He's going to be on our show tomorrow, round two.  Oh, he just ran for people's eyebrows.  Yeah, we might send some people down there, Pete.  You've got to.  All right, man.  All right, thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Should we tell people what we did for tomorrow's interview?  Because I think it's really funny.  Well, I think we had to do this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got two of the biggest guys we could find. 
[00:05:00]  Can we say they're cops?  I guess we just did, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two huge, humongous cops.  Yeah.  To be in the studio tomorrow for The Rock interview.  They will be.  Yeah.  Call us pussies if you like, but one's going to stand directly behind Anthony and one directly  behind my back.  Our bodyguards.  We're going to have two bodyguards tomorrow for the interview with The Rock.  I think we need them.  Well, because we don't know what the hell's going to happen tomorrow. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  All we know is The Rock is going to be on our show tomorrow, sometime after 5 o'clock.  That's all we know.  I guess he has a couple other things he's got to do, so that's why they can't nail down  an exact time.  So, you know who I'd like to protect me?  It might sound a little weird.  Cardinal O'Connor.  I could hide behind that huge head that he has now.  Come on.  No, come on.  No, you come on.  Open up the post to page four.  What is that?  It's a huge melon. 
[00:06:00]  What happened to Cardinal O'Connor?  That's life right there, Andy.  Oh, my God.  He looks like Uncle Fester in a Cardinal outfit.  He dedicated his life to the Catholic faith, and this is how he gets to go out.  He turns brain tumors in a huge head.  He turns 80 on Saturday.  Maybe he ought to lock himself out on a roof and freeze to death.  But, yeah, you dedicate your life to a God, and look how he pays you back. 
[00:06:30]  You're 80, and he gives you a brain tumor and makes it look like someone shoved an air  pump in your ear.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  62 pounds per square inch.  A little overpressure.  Come on, Andy.  The Cardinal's head's ready to pop.  It's the Cardinal.  Why is it like that?  Is that the chemotherapy or something?  Is it water on the brain?  I don't remember his head being that big a year ago.  No, even when he had hair on it, I mean, I think they had to let out his yarmulke, a 
[00:07:00]  skullcap thing he wears.  You know what he looks like?  The mutant creature from South Park with the big head from one of the first episodes?  What the hell was the name of that?  Like the evil...  Was it Stan or Kyle?  Remember that?  Jesus.  Remember that, though?  Yeah, with the big head.  With the big head that the scientist there on the top of the hill made?  They cloned him?  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  And his head was, you know, extra big?  It's terrible.  But, you know, God, the guy dedicated his life to the Lord.  And look at where he ends up.  Life isn't fair, Anthony.  He's fallen down when he's given his little services and stuff.  Remember when we played, what did we learn on the show today?  Life is not fair.  Wayne, what's up?  How you doing?  Real good.  You guys have ruined my life.  Why?  What happened?  I can't do anything between two and seven.  Oh, thanks.  Neither can we.  I just started going to school in Hofstra. 
[00:08:00]  We can do a lot between two and three, Aunt Naya found out.  I changed my whole life.  Work schedule, school schedule, everything.  Yeah?  Yesterday, I'm sitting there in my kitchen.  I got my laptop out, my phone there, my TV, my radio.  You guys have totally consumed my life.  Well, we're multimedia now.  I mean, we're not just a radio show.  You need a computer when you listen to the show, and now you need a TV as well.  It's outstanding.  Psycho Mark's the best thing to happen for TV ratings.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Take care.  Thank you, Wayne. 
[00:08:30]  Very good.  One more call, and we've got to take a break here.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Long time listener, first time caller, guys.  I just got a late Christmas gift.  I got the Demented World CD.  Oh, did you?  Awesome stuff, dudes.  Cool.  Now, since we're getting away with so much craziness, we got Mrs. C over there the other night,  and then yesterday, when are we coming out with this other CD?  Are they going to bend a little?  The new management. 
[00:09:00]  The new powers that be.  The new, yeah, the two powers that be.  The new powers.  Yeah.  They're working their butts off to see if we can get something going on with that.  Oh, that'll be great.  We should, I think we're going to have an answer, hopefully, within the next couple of weeks.  Really?  Because it died down a little.  We haven't heard much.  Well, because we didn't know what to tell you guys.  I mean, it was all set and ready to go.  It was ready to go to the CD plan, and at the last second, it was yanked from our noses.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So, I mean, if this thing gets out, we're going to be very excited.  Yeah, that was some funny stuff, guys. 
[00:09:30]  Cool.  You guys will.  Hey, the best is Bill.  Hi, my name is Bill.  Yeah, yeah.  The year in 81 was hilarious.  Oh, cool.  You're a bitch.  Hey, where did you find the Dementor World CD?  No, you know, the unofficial thing there.  Oh, yeah.  See, that sucks, because, I mean, we're still proud of our Dementor World CD we put out.  It's just not in any record stores, though.  I guess you got to order it online or something.  Yeah, I got it online, and it took a little while.  All right.  They told me they were going to send it, and they did.  It came through.  Cool. 
[00:10:00]  I'm looking forward to the next one.  And, guys, can I stop up one day?  Sure.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  All right, I'll talk to the guys.  I'll make stop up on Friday.  All right, Jimmy.  All right, babe?  Peace.  Peace.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  All right.  Getting a lot of requests for the Drowned Cuban Drown song.  Oh, my God.  What?  Oh, it's a hit, man.  Yes, well, it's very topical.  Let's send this in to Dr. Dementor.  Let's just get it on the radio.  We'll be back.  Drown, drown, Cuban Drown.

Alright  I just got to ask you  This whole rock situation now  Yeah  Is this all some cheap cross promotion  With some WWF show  That's going to be on the station  On Saturday nights?  Well, that's what David Hinkley  Likes to think  I guess he wrote about it again  Today in the Daily News  We had no idea  That we were carrying  The WWF show  This Saturday night  From, what, 8 to 10  Or something like that  We are?  Something like that  I swear  I had to read about it  In the paper today 
[00:17:30]  I swear  A lot of people are thinking  That this is some huge  Cross promotion  It is not  And if it becomes  A huge plug tomorrow  We will kick him out  Of the studio  You know?  Can I make one more  Request for tomorrow?  Yeah  Can you keep on playing  That half-free  Don't like it song  Every 15 minutes?

You haven't heard it yet  No  It's a quickie  It's like 40 seconds long  It's called  Rock is a Homo  Song  It smells like the rocks  Cooking quiche today  With a flowered apron on  And his hair's a toupee  But wait  Perhaps he's cooking  A filet mingay 
[00:18:30]  He's a very sensitive man  Oh, he's a drama-spinning homo of a man  Do you smell what the rock breed is cooking?  Jesus, man  Not a bad effort  Very good  Whoever says that  That's very good  Alright  I just read that now 
[00:19:00]  Lord of Hinckley  In the Daily News about us  God  You know what?  The thing is  You could think that it was all like a big publicity stunt  But I swear to you  I mean, come on  We're not BS over here  We've never done a big publicity stunt on purpose  No, we don't like doing things like that  Half the crap we do  End up becoming big publicity stunts  But we didn't try to make it happen that way  We had a meeting, what, yesterday?  About, you know, how do we handle  Well, part of the meeting was  How are we going to handle this when the rock comes in? 
[00:19:30]  What are we going to do?  And some of the suggestions that were coming in from  Other people that work here  I said, no, it sounds too much like it's a put-on  Yeah  Like we're trying to make this a  Like we planned it or something  I'm going to call him a crybaby  I'm going to tell him that, you know  You better watch what you say now  Because the listeners will call you on it, man  I don't care  I'm going to, though  I have to  Call him a crybaby?  I wouldn't be able to live with myself  If I didn't say that  After the last time 
[00:20:00]  We punked out last time, man  We punked out last time  That's the rock?  Yeah, that's the rock  Little crybaby  Oh, man  And we're going to have two huge cops behind us  The cops have our backs  All right  I got one for you and one for me  That's good  So we'll be able to pretty much say whatever we want  I'm a little frightened, though, still  When you see these cops, Ed  You're not going to be frightened at all  And if you want to call us pussies 
[00:20:30]  For getting two huge, humongous cops  To get our backs  Then you can call us a puss  That is kind of cool  So we can, like, say anything to him, I guess  That's what I'm thinking  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  All right  How you doing?  Good  You guys killed me yesterday  I'm driving home, cracking up  And then I remembered  I got this little TV  About a five-incher  That also plugs into the lighter thing in the car  Oh, yeah?

I got to watch every goddamn newscast there is now  People are bringing TVs to work  To listen to our show  Yeah  So, you know, you guys got me in a little trouble there  But  That's funny  And I also want to suggest  That people start hitting the 11 o'clock newscast  For those of us who aren't home at 5 o'clock  Yeah  Not a bad idea  Well, I mean, you know  Mark did MTV yesterday 
[00:21:30]  And they re-ran that last night  I didn't catch that  I didn't know they were re-raning it  Well, if you've got a computer, man  There's a whole montage of Mark on MTV in the background  With the wow sign on  Yeah  On the unofficial OPN  Okay, I didn't check that out yet  But I got to check that out  It's very funny  Don't have anything in your mouth  You'll spit it out  Do you guys have any Rumble tickets left?

You see it, right?  We're screaming House of Fade, and all the directors behind the camera are putting their finger up to their mouth going, 
[00:40:00]  you know?  They're looking at me like I had three holes in my head.  Very good.  The whole crowd went silent.  They were all screaming.  Oh, man.

Bridget, you're next on WADW.  What's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Maybe you can help me figure out what happened.  I called you guys yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're the girl that Anthony gave the BJ advice to, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  What happened?  Well, last night was my boyfriend's birthday. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  And I wanted to make it a great night for him.  So I got this great outfit, and I cooked a really great meal, and I invited him over.  My parents are out of the country right now.  Uh-huh.  So he brought over a movie, and we had dinner.  We sat down to the movie, and I was really nervous, but good nervous, really excited.  Yeah, you were actually ready to give him the first hummer you've ever given in your life.  And I've been with him for over a year. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  So halfway through the movie, I leaned over, and I whispered that I had a surprise for him.  Yeah.  And I told him to close his eyes.  Oh.  And I got down in front of him.  All right.  And I...  Be careful how you describe the rest of this.  Okay.  Go ahead.  So I had a little oil hidden underneath the couch, and I put it on my lips.  Oil?  A little bit, yeah.  Like what, 10W40?  Some Quaker state?  No.  Almond oil.  Oh, almond oil? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Just like lip gloss, but it wouldn't have...  All right.  Well, that's an interesting little feature.  That's pretty cool.  Okay.  So I started running my hands up his legs.  Yeah.  And I started kissing him.  Mm-hmm.  And he got really excited.  All right.  And I unbuttoned his pants.  All right.  Be careful.  Okay.  And I started following your instructions.  From yesterday.  Very good.  From yesterday.  Okay.  And I started really slowly.  All right.  Be careful.  Did you make the Charles Bronson face? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Hide those teeth.  Yeah.  So everything just really fell into place.  Everything seemed really natural.  I was really glad I called you guys, because I've never seen it before, except in a picture.  Right.  I've never seen a men's part before, so I would have been really shocked.  You've never even saw a guy naked before?  No.  I mean, little kids, but that's different.  Yeah, but you've had sex with this guy before, right? 
[00:43:00]  No.  Oh.  No.  Yesterday, you said you had sex with him.  No.  No.  I asked you if I should.  I'm glad I didn't know.  Why?  What happened?  Well, he finished.  Right.  And you guys said something about eating your broccoli.  Yeah.  I must have liked broccoli when I was little, because it was just, the whole thing was so  beautiful.  It was really, really beautiful.  Very nice.  So we helped you out with your first homer. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And then I finished.  Right.  And I, you know, kind of cleaned him up, and I looked up, just kind of to say happy  birthday or something, and he had his hands on either side of my head.  Oh, yeah?  And he had this terrible look on his face, and before I could say anything, he pushed  me back.  I'm not going to cry.  He pushed me back and threw me back, so my head hit the floor. 
[00:44:00]  Why did he do that?  I'm asking you.  I have no idea.  And he stood up, and he pulled up his pants, and he said that he always knew I was a little  whore.  Come on.  I swear.  And he told me never to call him again like I would at this point.  And he left.  Come on.  You're kidding.  You're kidding, right?  No.  Oh, my God.  He pushed you back and said he knew you were a little whore? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you are.  You're a little whore.  Well, there's plenty of guys out there that would appreciate you.  Wow.  Bridget.  What, what, did this guy have a stick up his butt?  I don't know.  He's never acted like this before.  Hmm.  But he waited until he was finished.  You know what you did?  Know what the problem was?  You were so good at it that he assumed that you just had a lot of practice. 
[00:45:00]  Maybe that's it.  I thought you were a pro at hobbing many knobs.  Right.  I have, I've never felt so.  Well, hold on the line.  Let's see if we can get some listeners to help you out today.  All right, Bridget?  Okay.  That's, that's just a tragic answer.  My God.  It's a great story.  It sounded like it was all going so well.  It was.  It was great.  He throws her head back.  Pushes her to the floor.  I can't believe you guys are laughing, are we?  Well, it just sounds, uh, like I couldn't believe it happened like that.  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  No.  All right.  Hold on a second, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Hold on.  Did you ever wonder if your mom gave dad a job right before she kissed you goodnight?  This can't be real.  Bridget, you still there?  I'm still here.  All right.  We're going to put you on with Manny.  Let's see what Manny has to say.  Hey, Manny.  Hey.  Did you just hear that tragic story from Bridget? 
[00:46:00]  That is so wrong.  That is so wrong.  The guy is wrong.  He should have just said what he ought to do and that's it, man.  Yeah.  That is wrong.  The girl sounds really nice.  She sounds very hot.  Yeah.  You're hot, Bridget.  Um, well, yeah.  I mean, I grew up ugly duckling, but...  How ugly duckling is that?  I mean, as far as what kind of ugly duckling are you talking about?  Well, I was really skinny growing up and red hair, so...  But I kind of grew into everything when I was about 17. 
[00:46:30]  I don't want to sound conceited, but yeah, I looked good.  No, the guy is wrong.  Don't even bother with stuff like that.  Move on to something better.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I can't believe he called you.  You were wrong for laughing like that.  Well, I'm sorry.  It's kind of like...  It's kind of a funny image of Conn.  I'm over here crying.  I'm telling the guys, yo, listen to this crap, man.  So this isn't what I have to look forward to.  All guys aren't like that, Bridget.  Nah, you got to just take...  There's a lot of guys out there that like little whores. 
[00:47:00]  Oh.  Oh.  All right, you guys.  Keep it up.  All right, man.  Bye.  All right, let's see what everyone else is saying.  Frank, you're on with Bridget.  What's up?  Oh, man.  Bridget, are you there?  Yeah, I'm here.  I feel so bad for you.  On behalf of the entire male gender, I want to apologize to you because you met the scum of the earth.  You had to have met the scum of the earth.  All men are not like that. 
[00:47:30]  Trust me.  Thank you.  That is so bad.  I mean, I'm sitting here driving, and I'm listening to your story, and I'm like, this can't be really happening.  And I just got a ticket, by the way.  Yeah?  A cop pulled me off and gave me a ticket because I did go through a red light that I never saw.  Oops.  It's a pretty and grossing story.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  Bye, Bridget.  Bye.  I feel so bad for Bridget.  I know.  You gave her the advice and everything, you know? 
[00:48:00]  It was awesome advice.  And you sound so sweet and innocent.  Who knew you were actually a whore?  Where'd you get the idea of the almond oil on your lips?  Yeah, maybe that was like a trick you assumed that.  Maybe he'd been to like a hooker that did the same thing.  Oh, that's a nice thought.  You know?  No.  No.  So you had never seen a guy's member before?  No.  It was nice, though.  Were you scared?  No, it was really nice. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Bob, you're next.  What do you have for Bridget?  Yeah, I just want to know, you know, if we just call you a slut, will you sleep with us?  Thanks, Bob.  Aw.  Come on, Bob.  Hey, listen.  You guys got to bring the homeless to the beach, man.  Yeah?  You guys got to get them stripped down and just their shorts swimming around all the little kids playing.  That would be great.  Homeless beach party.  No, public pool.  Absolutely.  One of those nice public pools.  That's a great idea.  All right, Bob. 
[00:49:00]  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Later.  Hey, you guys, when you brought the homeless to Short Hills, I live right by there.  Uh-huh.  Did you give them Hummers?  You little slut?  I was going into the stores ahead of you guys.  I looked the role for Short Hills, and I was talking to the store owners and then tipping off your guys who were saying bad things about them.  Oh, thank you.  You're welcome.  You're helping out the show.  Billy from Air Seek Productions.  Billy, what do you have for Bridget?  I can't tell you what I have for Bridget.  Bridget, you got to do me and all the other guys out in the audience a favor. 
[00:49:30]  We really appreciated your story, but you got to tell it again much slower.  Leave out the very part of the end, because all the guys out here spanking it, you ruined it.  I don't know.  Even that was a turn-on at the end.  No, the fact that he called her a slut.  Pushing her back and calling her a slut.  A slut.  I always knew you were a little slut.  Can you call a girl a dirty little whore who hasn't, they've been going out for a year and they haven't done anything?  Well, I guess, is he a holy roller or something, Bridget?  I have no idea.  Does he, like, what, is he, uh, was he making any sexual advances towards you over the time you were going out? 
[00:50:00]  He's been badgering me for, since I met him to have sex with him.  Wow.  Is he, is he your dad?  Or your puppy?  He sounds like he's got some issues.  Bridget, I have the cure for you.  What?  What you have to do is get yourself a nice camera.  Yeah.  Get some pictures of yourself and send it in to the girls of O&A at the unofficial website.  Yeah.  We need more girls.  That'd be nice.  We need more girls sending in pictures of themselves for the unofficial opiate athlete website. 
[00:50:30]  Absolutely.  What better way to feel better about yourself?  Yeah.  There's a new section called, uh, the girls of O&A.  That'd make you feel better.  All right, Billy.  Bridget, if you want, I'll come take the pictures.  Thanks.  Oh, no problem.  All right, Billy.  Bye-bye, guys.  We got to give James a chance here.  Let's see.  Uh, James, you're on with Bridget.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  Two things.  First of all, your boyfriend's a complete faggot.  What's wrong with this guy?  All right?  And second of all, you are a genius. 
[00:51:00]  You just came up with a total, like, genius plan for marketing.  This almond oil is like the Velveeta on the broccoli.  Where did you come up with that?  Yeah, what?  You could eat my broccoli anytime.  That's why I think you liked it so much.  It was that almond oil.  Yeah, where did you learn the almond oil lip trick there?  Well, I wanted to put something on my lips to make them really smooth.  Yeah.  But lip gloss has all sorts of chemicals in there. 
[00:51:30]  I didn't want to get anything on them.  Yeah.  You know, that is a problem that some of the guys have, though.  You know, sometimes you ladies are so good, we're just convinced that you had a lot of practice.  Well, you know what?  It's like, you know, a little cheese whiz on the broccoli and stuff.  I'm going to make my wife do that every time now.  Oh, that's so, James.  Bridget, how old are you?  Everyone wants to know.  I'm 19.  19, that's right.  Perfect.  Perfect age.  Wow, look at that.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Humming career.  Thank you, James.  Bye.  Bye. 
[00:52:00]  Well, Bridget, I hope this isn't going to turn you off to giving hummers.  No.  That's the last thing we need.  Old Dirty!  Oh, so tender, Bridget, like these pork chops I'm frying up right now.  Oh, my.  Where'd you steal them, Old Dirty?  So you live by Short Hills, huh?  So that means you got money.  Look at that.  Who's not going to ask for your address?  Because that would be too obvious.  But your man, the guy you were giving the hummer to, you know, you guys are well-to-do and stuff like that? 
[00:52:30]  Because, you know, like your parents are out of the country, you know, my mom's goes, like, out of the borough.  I think she's in England, kid.  Yeah.  No, my parents have their money, but it's their money.  It's their money.  So what, the guy you gave the hummer to, he was, like, snob?  He, like, his parents, like, give him everything and stuff like that?  Oh, I'm finding it hard to find good things to say about him right now, but, yeah.  Oh, look, she's all upset and everything.  You see? 
[00:53:00]  You see that?  So you got a bump on your head when he threw you backwards like that?  I do have a bump on my head.  But why did he throw you back?  I don't know.  I haven't, I don't know.  Oh, Dirty, weren't you listening because he's convinced that she's a little slut because she did such a good...  I was shocked to find out his little angel was, uh, was, uh, stepped at the lips.  Why was he after me that long to do something then?  He was screwed up.  Something's wrong.  Something's wrong with him.  Yeah, it's him.  Like, homeboy was, was, was dogging her to, to, to, to hit the, to hit the ass, and now he got it going, and he got rid of it. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Well, I don't, you know...  All right, old Dirty.  I don't get it, man.  I don't get it either.  Bridget, hold on the line.  We're going to give you some stuff from the Opie and Anthony Price closet.  Oh, that's okay.  Would you like, uh, Opie Goes to South Central?  Yeah, it's a porno movie.  No, no porno.  No?  All right, hold on a line.  We'll take care of you, though.  Okay, thank you, you guys. 
[00:54:00]  All right, and there's a few more people that want to talk to you, so make sure they keep you on hold, okay?  Hey, Bridget, quickly.  You know how, you know how you could, uh, maybe, I don't even know if you want to get back in his good graces?  No, no.  Yeah.  Well, next time, if that ever happens again, uh, offer him up the back door.  Offer him the hoop.  Yeah, offer him the hoop, the balloon knot.  Wow.  That'll fix it right up.  Right up.  That's a big move there, kid.  Yeah, the guy will be convinced that she's an innocent girl and that she's in porno or something. 
[00:54:30]  She's going to need a lot more than almond oil, kid.  I'll tell you that much.  Some WD-40.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, we know what you're saying.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Bridget.  Bridget.  Yeah?  Um, I love you.  Listen to you, you pig.  We have to save this little flower from lesbianism.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, when you saw the member, were you excited to see it? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, I was.  You were?  Yeah.  We got you all hot and, you know.  Hey, Bridget, can we get your, like, boyfriend on the line or something?  Yeah, you should do that.  Oh, your ex-boyfriend?  No.  We'll call him.  No.  I don't want anything to do with him.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  All right.  Hold on, guys, okay?  We got to take a quick break here.  Okay.  There goes Bridget.  Cute, little, innocent Bridget, Anthony.  Loretta, real fast.  We got to take a break.  What's up?  No, I saw you guys jumping around outside of TRL. 
[00:55:30]  He's in the middle of the street, right behind the rock with the wow sign.  I know.  He's going to get hit by a bus or something.  You see that?  You better be careful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He struck again today.  Oh, God.  It was hilarious.  Between yesterday and today, I look forward to it now.  Oh, cool.  Thanks, Loretta.  Thanks.  Could you hook me up with any Royal Rumble tickets?  We don't have those.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, Anthony.  May I ask we take a break?  Yes.  For all the new members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, a little song from Air Sick Productions. 
[00:56:00]  Hummer lovin' on Tuesday night.  Hummer lovin', it feels so right.  I got my girl down on her knees.  Wonder if he will do me.  Hummer's gone.  Keyshawn is gone.  Oh, I feel a Tuesday night.  Hummer, hummer, hummer, hummer, hummer. 
[00:56:30]  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  We don't care where we are.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  Do it right in the car.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  She came to me.  I dropped my pants.  You owe this to all be an end.  I'll call them up when you go down.  Over here.  I see your big sound.  Hummer's done.  Get me some gum.  Oh, I'll be the bomber night. 
[00:57:00]  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  I don't mean to offend.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  Now can you do my friend?  I exploded.  That's where it ends.  I have got the world's best girlfriend.  I love to be in his lap. 
[00:57:30]  Think it's time.  I took a nap.  Hummer's done.  There's more to come.  But.  Those hummer.  Now. 
[00:58:00]  There is love.  There is love.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of fud.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  You'll love Paisano.  We go down there all the time. 
[00:58:30]  Joey's a fine host.  We love the Italian cuisine, authentic Italian cuisine from age-old recipes, Opie.  You go down there.  You're an Italian guy like me.  You're used to grandma's cooking.  Yeah, because I think, like, I could be tricked by Italian food.  Maybe.  Because I'm not a, you know.  Right.  I'm not a.  You're not a guinea like me?  Yeah, that's what I wanted to say.  I knew, but I could say it because I am.  So it's not easy to fool you, Anthony.  You've had old-fashioned Italian cooking from your grandma. 
[00:59:00]  I grew up with it.  Okay.  And I go to Paisano's and get an authentic Italian cuisine.  Very good.  I like the stuffed veal chop.  Oh.  And the fried ravioli.  Right.  To die for.  Right.  Then you get the big thing of pasta and clams.  They just have everything you could want from an Italian restaurant.  The atmosphere, the food, the service.  You go down there.  Bring the family.  Bring a date.  You'll have a great time.  And then you see Joey walking around. 
[00:59:30]  You go, hey, Joey.  How you doing?  Opie and Anthony sent me.  And he'll give you a free glass of wine.  Yeah, because he's good like that.  Yes, he is.  All right.

[01:00:00]  1027-WNEWA.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for joining us today.  Yay.  212-757-1027.  The phones are just going wild here, Anthony.  Bridget's still on the line.  Poor Bridget.  Bridget, you still there?  I'm still here.  You all right?  I'm okay.  Bridget called yesterday, Anthony, a little 19-year-old girl.  She's never had sex before.  Her boyfriend was having a birthday.  She figured she'd do the right thing and give him a Hummer.  She asked us for Hummer advice. 
[01:00:30]  Anthony walked her through it.  She did the deed last night, and after it was complete and everything was good, she  thought everything was great.  It was a perfect night.  He pretty much, what, just pushed you backwards onto your head?  Yeah.  Sorry.  And you banged your head.  You got a bump on your head, and he goes, I always knew you were a little slut.  Right.  I always knew you were a little slut?  All right, hold on.  There's a girl.  A whore, actually. 
[01:01:00]  A little whore?  All right, hold on.  KC's on the line, a girl.  She says this is common.  KC, what's up?  Hey, youse guys.  How are you?  Okay, how you doing?  Youse guys.  Youse guys.  How old are you?  Twice her age.  Oh, really?  It hurts to say that.  No, that's okay.  So you think this is not uncommon, right?  Yeah, I've been in a situation where I was dating a guy for a while, already having sex,  and then you get to the part where you're dating for a while, and now you're going to have really good,  you'll never forget me for the rest of your life, sex. 
[01:01:30]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And then the next day, they're like, uh, so who have you been with?  So tell me, guys, what's that all about?  Well, we're a little paranoid, you know?  We're convinced, you know, you try a new trick or something that you learned it somewhere.  Or if you're really good when we first start dating you, we're like, oh, man, this girl's a slut.  How many guys has she slept with?  Where did that move come from?  Yeah, well, that's the whole point of, like, waiting a little while and then being in a place where it's like, okay, here it comes.  Uh-huh.  So that's not what I expected. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  So that did happen to you, though?  Yeah.  And it wrecked the relationship?  Um, yeah, I wrecked it.  I was like, well, screw you.  Yeah, any advice?  I'd rather be with somebody who's going to appreciate that.  Any advice for Bridget?  She's on the line.  Screw him.  Bridget?  You hear that?  Move on.  Move on.  Stupid guy.  No problem.  Yeah.  She's really upset, though.  I know, but, you know, that's, he could have not, like, knocked you down, you know?  Yeah, that was the worst thing.  That's a bad sign. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  Hang in.  But, Casey, I don't know why we think that way, but we do.  Guys, you know, if you guys are really good, when we first started a date, you were like, man.  Well, I could understand.  The girl has a lot of experience.  I could do that.  Yeah.  All right.  Well...  Or if you break out a new trick, you know, in the relationship, you're like, wow, where  did you learn that?  You've got to hold back a few things in your repertoire, you know?  Oh, yeah, no.  You rent a couple of movies, then you learn a few things.  I wonder if she learned that in Cosmo. 
[01:03:00]  Certainly.  Then you go find the latest Cosmo to see if that trick was in there or something.  All right, Casey.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bridget, John is saying there's some holes in your story.  Let's move on to John.  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  It's the one under her nose that got her in trouble, that hole.  Huh?  Bridget.  What's up, John?  Yo, I think...  I don't know.  Her story don't make sense.  That is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life, though.  And you've got to do that.  You've got to get her guy on the phone, because I'm not buying her story. 
[01:03:30]  I'm giving it to the guy right now, because that just doesn't make sense at all.  Yeah, we really want to talk to this guy, Bridget.  I don't want to talk to him.  No?  Because she's full of it.  She either bit it off or something.  She just doesn't have her story right one bit.  I don't know.  She sounds for real to me.  I don't know.  Get the guy on, and then we'll decide, because right now I think she's full of it.  All right, John.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  You believe her, right, Ant? 
[01:04:00]  I would like to.  Yeah.  You know.  Bridget, I believe you.  You believe me.  I believe you.  Andy, what's up?  Yeah, I got some advice for her.  Yeah.  What?  Maybe next time, when you're done, you shouldn't say,  this is the way your father likes it.  Oh.  Nice.  Come on, Andy.  You can't tell me you honestly believe that this girl's telling the truth.  Andy, what are we going to play?  Make Bridget?  She's so full of it.  Come on.  Hey, Bridget, can we play a game with you?  Sure.  Sure. 
[01:04:30]  Hey, we have a really good prize.  Okay.  I don't need a prize.  What's the game?  We gave you stuff, though.  You can back out, but I want to play.  Let's see who can make Bridget cry.  Well, that's going to be really hard.  Really?  Do you want to play it?  What?  Let's make Bridget cry?  I mean, if we could, like, have a whole bit that revolves around your mom,  I think it's okay to play Let's Make Bridget Cry.  Okay.  I think it might be a little rough to. 
[01:05:00]  I don't know.  Bridget.  It's a little whore to cry.  I don't think she is going to cry.  Well, Andy, you tried, and she didn't vibe, so.  You know why she ain't crying?  Because she's full of it.  All right.  Well, thank you, Andy.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  How long are you going out with this guy for, Bridget?  Just over a year.  Yeah?  Kind of grew attached to him?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Kind of made you feel bad when he did that to you?  He's a dick.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  Hold on.  Did you feel dirty?  Did you feel...  You know what I did afterward?  What?  Brushed your teeth?  I hope.  Gargled.  I took one of my mom's Valium, and I drank half a bottle of wine that was left.  All right.  Listen.  I went in the shower, and I turned it on scalding hot, and I just sat there, and I just cried.  I just cried.  You cried and cried.  Kind of like that.  Because you're a little whore.  Kind of like that scene from The Big Chill with Glenn Close in the shower? 
[01:06:00]  I didn't see The Big Chill with.  Oh.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Do we want to play this game?  She seems a little unstable.  Go ahead.  Make her cry, man.  No.  We want the listeners to play Make Bridget Cry for a prize.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Do we have wrestling tickets for Raw's War when they do that live at Madison Square Garden?  All right.  Let me clear all the lines.  Let me clear all the lines.  If you want to play Make Bridget Cry, give us a call.  212-757-1027. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, that's horrible.  Well, I asked you guys if you want to play.  You said yes.  Yes.  It'll be funny.  It's horrible, but funny.  Don't get me wrong.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me clear all the lines.  Bridget.  Hey, Bridget.  Yeah?  Before we play, I'm going to give you one more chance to back out.  Don't shut up.  No, don't back out.  I'm okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Jay's saying we shouldn't play.  Let's make Bridget Cry.  Jay?  Hey, Jay? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah?  This is a little too much for you?  Yeah, that's messed up, man.  Let's go with her.  It's so dramatic.  You can't try to make her cry.  It'll be therapeutic.  Oh, well, man.  It'll be upsetting.  We have our first contestant, Anthony.  I'm a believer.  All right.  Anthony's on the line?  Jay, someone wants to play Make Bridget Cry.  All right.  All right.  This is so...  I've got to go on record and say this is so wrong.  Come on.  This is so wrong.  Bridget, you ready?  I'm ready.  Okay.  We're going to start with Anthony. 
[01:07:30]  Anthony, our first contestant on Make Bridget Cry.  You will be the sole judge.  I never agreed to play this game.  This girl is a phony.  Playing this game is BS, but I was funny.  It's cancer.  This is sick.  You guys can't pick on this girl.  She's going to commit suicide.  You don't want to play?  I'm not going to commit suicide.  I'm okay.  Yeah.  Drink a bottle of wine and a vacuum.  No, you don't want to commit suicide.  Oh, please.  Like, I won't kill you.  You don't want to play, then?  No, I don't want to play.  Can I have wrestling games anyway?  No. 
[01:08:00]  You're a pussy.  Let's go to...  Should we go to Jeff?  Yeah.  Jeff, you're our first contestant on Make Bridget Cry.  Brittany, this is the biggest croc.  There's no way that this guy is going to push you down and all that kind of stuff.  It's impossible.  Telling me it didn't happen is not going to make me cry.  No, because then you're saying that you're going and you're taking Valium and wine.  How come you didn't say that earlier?  Make her cry.  Don't interrogate her.  She's not going to cry.  She's not going to make me cry.  She's not going to cry because it never happened.  It absolutely never happened. 
[01:08:30]  Well, we want guys that'll want to play.  Yeah, you're not a good player.  I do want to play, but this girl, there's no way that she did it.  No guy is going to tell her that it was bad and push her down and tell her that.  It's impossible.  All right.  That's the biggest croc.  You're going out of line and you're embarrassing yourself.  All right.  Well, Jeff really does want to play, obviously, Anthony.  I know.  Bridget, we'll go to Eric, okay?  Okay.  Eric.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Man, you guys, you know, I love you guys, but this is disgusting.  And every guy who calls up and he's like, yeah, you know, the guys are all grit and crap 
[01:09:00]  for, you know, pushing her down in our face.  This is sick, man.  It is sick.  It is sick.  I ask.  You know, it's like every guy is like, yeah, they're high-fiving each other, you know?  They're not high-fiving.  Most people think it's horrible.  It's messed up, man.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Eric doesn't want to play either.  These people, it says, want to play, and none of them want to play.  Who's screening these calls?  Who's screening the calls?  Bridget.  Hello?  You said it's okay to play Make Bridget Cry, right?  It's okay to make Bridget Cry. 
[01:09:30]  This is really painful.  There's some guys that are ready to play now.  Brett.  Yo.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  You're on with Bridget.  Bridget.  Yeah?  What is wrong with you?  With me?  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Why?  What do you think is going to happen when somebody sticks their penis in you?  What do you mean?  What are you going to do then? 
[01:10:00]  Well, hopefully it'll end up a little better.  Huh?  Hopefully it's better.  The guy smacked you after you performed oral on him.  Yeah.  What's he going to do after he had sex with you?  Is he going to beat you around a little bit?  I'm not going to be with him.  Huh?  Okay.  I don't think he's working.  Good try, Brett.  Not playing the right angles.  How many seconds do we allow?  We'll just allow. 
[01:10:30]  We're the sole judges.  We'll cut you off whenever we feel it's not working.  All right, EJ.  You're the next contestant in Make Bridget Cry.  What's up, fellas?  What's going on?  All right, EJ.  Cool.  Hey, Bridget, I was wondering.  Yeah.  Uh, is it because, are you so upset because, was it that your mom did a better job on your  boyfriend, or was it, did you have flashbacks of your father knocking you down after you  did him?  Nice.  Okay, this could be wrong. 
[01:11:00]  You've got to follow it up, EJ.  You ever watch a fight, and a fight against a good right hook-in, and he wobbles the guy,  but then the fighter backs off, and you're like, pound him, pound him.  Yeah.  You know, you've got to have a follow-up to that shot.  All right, EJ.  All right, fellas.  Thank you.  Later.  All right, listen.  We've got to regroup.  If we're going to play this, we've got to take a break and get real contestants on the  line, Anthony, okay?  Okay, yeah.  Bridget?  Hey, Bridget.  Yeah?  We're going to take a quick break, and then we're going to continue the game with some real 
[01:11:30]  players, okay?  Okay.  If you want to play Make Bridget Cry, give us a call, 212-757-1027.  We'll be back.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Booty doodle.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  O.P.  And Anthony, we punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  So, 1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW. 
[01:12:00]  It's the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  I think, Anthony, we've gone too far today.  Why?  On the radio show.  Well, we're playing a game called Make Bridget Cry.  Yeah, Bridget had a little trouble on a Hummer Tuesday last night.  It was her boyfriend's birthday.  She wanted to give him a Hummer for his birthday.  She did.  It was a beautiful scene, as she spelt it out for us.  And when her boyfriend finished, and she accepted his finishing, he grabbed her head, pushed her away, her head hitting the floor, and said, 
[01:12:30]  I always knew you were a little whore.  And it was the first time she ever gave a Hummer.  Yes.  Bridget, you're still there, right?  I'm still here.  Now, remember, you said you wouldn't mind playing Make Bridget Cry, so you sounded like you were getting a little choked up earlier in your conversation talking about your boyfriend and how you're not going to see him again.  Yeah, it shouldn't be hard.  And you sure you want to play this?  Our listeners could be mean bastards. 
[01:13:00]  That won't make me cry.  All right.  Tony!  Yeah?  You're up first.  You want to play?  Yeah, I want to play.  First of all, I know who this broad is.  Okay.  Her real name isn't Bridget.  All right.  And Tuesday night wasn't her first Hummer.  Monday night was.  She practiced on me before she was with her boyfriend.  That's why he called her a pig.  She knows it's the truth.  And you know who this is, Bridget.  And don't pretend you don't, Bridget.  Tony, I have no idea who you are.  You don't know who this is, huh?  No. 
[01:13:30]  You practiced the almond thing on me.  You wish.  Yeah.  No, you know it's the truth.  And so does Henry, your real boyfriend.  That's why he called you a pig.  And he said you were horrible.  She knows it, One.  I'm sorry.  She's a pig.  A stinking pig.  No, I don't think it's working, but that was pretty brutal.  That was brutal.  Uh, Brett.  Yo.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  You're on with Bridget.  Bridget.  Yeah?  What is wrong with you? 
[01:14:00]  With me?  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  Why?  What do you think is going to happen when somebody sticks their penis in you?  What do you mean?  What are you going to do then?  Well, hopefully it'll end up a little better.  Huh?  Hopefully it's better.  The guy smacked you after you performed oral on him.  Yeah.  What's he going to do after he had sex with you?  Is he going to beat you around a little bit?  I'm not going to be with him.  Huh?  Okay.  Yeah, I don't think he's working.  Good try, Brett.  Not playing the right angles.  How many seconds do we allow? 
[01:14:30]  We'll just allow.  We're the sole judges.  We'll cut you off whenever we feel it's not working.  All right, EJ, you're the next contestant in Make Bridget Cry.  What's up, fellas?  What's going on?  All right, EJ.  Cool.  Hey, Bridget, I was wondering.  Yeah.  Is it because, are you so upset because, was it that your mom did a better job than your boyfriend?  Or was it, did you have flashbacks of your father knocking him down after you did him?  Nice. 
[01:15:00]  Okay, this could be wrong.  You got to follow it up, EJ.  You ever watch a fight and a fighter gets a good right hook in and he wobbles the guy,  but then the fighter backs off and you're like, pound him, pound him.  Yeah.  You know, you got to have a follow up to that shot.  All right, EJ.  All right, fellas.  Thank you.  Later.  All right, let's go to Pat.  Pat, you're next.  All right, first of all, the suicide thing.  A volume of two glasses of wine.  Quiet, I'm talking.  A volume of two glasses of wine in a hot shower. 
[01:15:30]  That sounds like you're getting ready to go out.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, I know.  That's what I was saying.  Come on.  I mean, and this whole thing, I'll tell you, I think it happened, not in this world,  in whatever world, you're in, I think this is all cooked up in your fat little head,  because I'm sure you weigh at least 300 pounds.  You're probably so ugly, no guy would let you hum.  I mean, let's be serious here.  Bridget?  Hello?  Not working.  No?  You're not as big as Monica Lewinsky? 
[01:16:00]  No.  Let's go to Frankie.  Frankie!  Bridget?  Yeah?  How much you charge?  I want to know, right now.  Get on your knees and tell me what you could do.  Bridget, let me tell you something.  You know you're an expert.  You know you know what you're doing.  Tell me what it is.  What time I got to pick you up.  Let's go out, baby.  You guys have sensitive listeners, huh?  What?  You're popping volumes sitting in the shower.  Come on, honey. 
[01:16:30]  I got volumes.  Let's go.  Come on, Bridget.  I can get you.  I know I can.  You think?  I know I can.  Frankie.  Why right now?  You're running out of time, Frankie.  I got a couple of volumes.  Let's go.  All right.  That was it.  I don't think anyone's going to get you to cry, Bridget.  Uh, Dave, you're next.  Yeah, this is your daddy, Bridget.  Hi, daddy.  Why'd you cheat on me with that boy?  You know you're a filthy little pig. 
[01:17:00]  Nice.  You know you're a whore.  Thanks, Dad.  He slammed your head back because you didn't swallow at all.  That's why he smacked you.  You're only upset because he didn't tie you up and spank the hell out of you like your daddy do.  It's not called make Bridget laugh.  Yeah, she's laughing.  I should get a prize for that, shouldn't I?  Hey, Bridget.  Yeah? 
[01:17:30]  Hey, when was the last time you did cry?  All night.  This morning.  Really?  Yeah.  All sad about your boyfriend and how he treated you.  I loved him.  You loved him?  Just think of when you first got together.  Remember that?  Everything was all nice and sweet.  Did he do nice things for you?  He was so nice.  Yeah.  You went out a lot and he got you things and it was all fun.  And then last night he just pushed your head away and called you a whore. 
[01:18:00]  You're never, ever going to have a good time with him ever again.  I don't want to.  That could have been the last guy, the last decent guy you meet.  You might have to troll through scum now for years.  Oh, my God.  Having different members in your face.  No.  Week after week before you find somebody that's even half as nice as this guy treated you up until he turned on you last night. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  It's hard for a filthy whore to find a boyfriend.  You were really close.  Uh-huh.  I almost was there.  George, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  All right.  Hey, Bridget.  Yeah?  I feel really sorry for you.  You know, you spent a year with this guy.  Mm-hmm.  And you guys had a lot of good times together.  Mm-hmm.  And then he turns around and it's like it didn't mean nothing to him all those times spent together.  He just turned around and was like, you're nothing but trash. 
[01:19:00]  You're nothing but dirt on my shoe.  It's even worse that he threw me.  Didn't that feeling just lingers with you?  It just doesn't go away, does it?  No.  Every time you just think of him, you think of all those good times, you try to please him.  For God's sake, you know?  You try to.  And you did.  I don't think you did anything wrong.  For the love of God, I'm going to cry.  Come on.  No.  I'm sorry, Bridget, but I don't think you did anything wrong.  I think you're a pretty girl inside and you shouldn't be treated like that, you know, like trash. 
[01:19:30]  He just pushed you.  It's like you're nothing.  You're nothing to me.  You never meant nothing to me.  All right, George.  Thank you.  Very close.  My brother wants to play.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, Darren.  Hey.  You're a cold-hearted F.  You want to play?  I am very cold.  All right.  But I mean this with all my heart.  Bridget?  Yeah?  This is as good as it gets, babe. 
[01:20:00]  What do you mean?  Does your chin, like, have calluses on it from his d*** banging you?  I mean, the whole year you're going out, that's all he's thinking.  It's like, when can I use her as a depository for my freaking s***?  Now you're going to go out.  You're going to be a slut the rest of your life.  You're never going to have a real relationship because you're going to be all freaking weepy.  You're not going to forget this.  That taste is never going to leave your mouth and your face.  And that's just as good as it gets.  So, you know, you're a whore.  You're a girl.  Get over it.  You know? 
[01:20:30]  Thanks, Darren.  Well, life is good for guys and bad for girls.  And that's all he wanted.  I mean, and he got it.  I applaud him.  I'm laughing.  I'm like, this is the best.  I've got to meet this guy and, you know, join the club.  That's great.  So, that's it.  Holy smoke.  You've got more issues than hoping.  No way.  You know what comes out of a guy's member during the day? 
[01:21:00]  And here you are, gladly accepted.  And then he throws you on the floor and that surprises you?  Oh, she hung up.  What the heck is going on?  I made her hang up.  My brother wins the contest.  Winner.  Yeah.  We've got to find out how many times they've dumped out of my brother's speech there.  I couldn't take it anymore.  What is this? 
[01:21:30]  Like, make her feel good about herself?  Forget it.  I told him, he's a cold-hearted son of a bitch.  Man.  He's got ice flowing through his veins.  Yeah, I have Sandy over here, too.  Oh, easy.  He's going to make you cry.  All right, Darren.  All right, Darren.  All right, I'll see you later.  All right, man.  Bye.  My brother wins.  Wow.  That was harsh. 
[01:22:00]  That was a little too real sounding coming at him.  He's been there, trust me.  We've got to get Bridget called back to make sure she's okay.  She did want to play the game, right, Ant?  Yes.  All right, let's take a quick break.  We'll be back.  In theaters now.  In theaters now, the Brady Bunch movie.  That's right.  It's those lovable, sex-crazed Bradys.  Mom, Mom.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  Oh, no.  Cindy, not again.  Cindy's at it again.  I'm coming.  I'm coming.  Thank you. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, congratulations, honey.  Why don't you go tell Alice the News?  She's in her room.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  And done to be brought a huge bag.  Brainwreck radio.  Ben Goldberg.  This is sicker than faces of death.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, we just played a game of make Bridget cry. 
[01:23:00]  She hung up.  My brother won.  I think she's calling back here.  Bridget.  Hi, guys.  You all right?  I'm okay.  What happened?  You hung up on us.  I didn't mean to.  I'm sorry.  Were you crying?  Yeah.  You were?  Your brother said just about everything that was going through my head.  Oh, no.  Opie's brother is disturbed.  I don't know.  He was really unleashing. 
[01:23:30]  Did you really cry when you hung up?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Hold on.  I think my brother's online.  He wants to.  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't want to talk to you, brother.  He wants to apologize.  Darren.  Darren.  Is he there?  Elmo.  Did he hang up?  Might not be there.  All right.  Hold on a sec.  See if he's there.  That might be him calling in again.  Bridget.  Yeah?  You all right?  I'm okay.  You said you would play the game. 
[01:24:00]  I know.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Boom.  Well, we have a winner.  My brother.  Congratulations, Darren.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I'm just waiting to see if my brother calls back.  What was the part that really got to you?  Yeah.  I just feel like, you know, after a year, and I just feel used, and I didn't get anything  out of it. 
[01:24:30]  I don't even, you know?  It's like you wasted a bunch of time with this guy.  Not only that, I gave something to him.  And then it just blew up.  Something very personal and private.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was the line that really got you?  I don't even know.  No?  What are you going to miss most about this guy?  Nothing.  Well, there had to be something you're going to miss about.  Not right now.  No? 
[01:25:00]  No.  Can't think back before this horrible thing and think of something nice that you're going  to miss?  I don't think so.  Not right now.  All right.  Hold on.  There's a few people that want to talk to you.  Let's go and try to cheer her up, I'm sure.  Oh, yeah.  They're right.  Ilona?  Yes.  What's up?  Hi.  How are you?  You're on the line with Bridget.  I think Bridget's full of it.  Because if you hold out for a year, a guy would be so thankful to get it.  And even if he did think she was a whore, he'd still stay with her and keep coming  back for more.  Is that from personal experience? 
[01:25:30]  Not exactly personal experience, but I've seen it happen.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, there's just no way.  Yeah.  Guys will not say no to a Hummer.  No.  Maybe.  Whatever he thinks of her, it doesn't matter.  He can go and get more on the side or whatever the case may be.  Right.  But he'd still stay with her and get more.  I mean, especially if it was good.  Well, maybe the fact that it didn't bother him.  If it did, in fact, happen, then he is just a mental case.  I mean, what's wrong with him?  Well, that's probably the fact.  Maybe it bothered him so much. 
[01:26:00]  I really do find it kind of hard to swallow, though.  I really do.  Well, Bridget didn't.  I don't.  I don't.  Bridget had no problem.  What?  Bridget had no problem, so.  He could be a holy roller or something, Opie, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  One of those kind of people that, you know, for a year after not having sex,  and he didn't even want to have sex with this girl.  Right.  And she comes on to him, and he feels like she's a whore.  He should know her well enough after a year to know that she's not.  She was, in fact, doing it for the first time, whether it was good or not, 
[01:26:30]  because I know I was good right from the get-go.  Right.  So, without practice or no practice.  All right.  If you got it, you got it.  Well, don't pump yourself up there, Lona.  Well, my fiancé seems to think so.  And even a bad one's pretty good.  That's right.  Well, no.  It's not rocket science.  Yeah.  Science.  Insert, move up, down, repeat.  There you go.  Move up, down.  No, actually, I had someone describe it as the roof of his,  the top of his head caving in on him.  That's how good it felt. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  Thank you, Lona.  You're welcome.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  The cinder block and the wall of the projects might have fallen on top of him.  We have Paul in the studio, Anthony,  a faithful listener of the show.  Hey, Bridget, I got a question for you.  Yeah?  Well, just to prove that everybody that they're wrong and stuff like that,  why don't you come down here and bring your almond oil  and let's prove that maybe you did something right or wrong.  Why not?  There's nothing to matter with that.  I mean, you've already done it once.  It's no big deal now, right?  Yeah, we should get you a date or something. 
[01:27:30]  Now we feel we have to make it up to you  because we made you cry this afternoon.  Not only that, she hasn't,  she never got a banging out of it.  Like, you don't, what, what, you didn't get,  you've never been banged?  No.  So she never even got that.  She gives a hummer.  The guy treats her like a whore.  And she's never even had sex.  Yeah.  Who's on the line with Bridget?  Hello.  Hey, me.  Lucia, whatever your name is.  Yeah, yeah.  What's up?  Lucia.  Yeah, I'm over twice that girl's age, I was saying. 
[01:28:00]  Okay.  Bridget, relax.  Max, I wanted to give a reason for half those guys to cry  that were so cruel.  All right.  When they, when they, yeah,  if their wives or girlfriends or whatever,  possible future girls hear that about them  and how they treated you and how they didn't believe it,  one, their sensitivity that they didn't believe it  is because they'd never do it.  But two, about half those girls have been through something similar.  And they're not going to believe how insensitive their guys were. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  But how could you be like that?  And don't let it happen again, hon.  All right.  Thank you, Lucia.  Bye.  We really got to wrap up this segment.  She came dreadfully close.  I know.  Oh, it was pulling out of the station.  I swear to God.  And my finger was right on it.  Jay, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on?  I just wanted to say that this girl's boyfriend ruined it for everybody  because she's never going to give a hummer again.  Yeah.  Bridget, will you?  Yeah, Bridget.  It could have been worse.  She could have got a dirty Sanchez.  Bridget, will you ever give a hummer again? 
[01:29:00]  I told you.  I thought it was really beautiful.  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of guys that would find a beautiful picture.  Can I hold out for her number?  Yeah, let's put her number on, like, eBay or something.  You can bid for it.  Hey, you guys, can you play that Delta commercial, the Ebonics?  Yeah.  Where is that one?  Do I have that in front of me here?  Oh, that thing is the best, man.  You guys are the stuff.  All right.  Thank you, man.  Bye.  You'd be flying up in that bitch.  Hey, Spaz, find the...  Oh, I just hung up on Bridget by accident.  Find the Delta commercial, the homie thing. 
[01:29:30]  We've got to move on from Bridget.  I feel bad we made her cry today, Anthony.  Debbie, what's up?  I'm sure you feel horrible.  What's up, guys?  All right.  What are you doing?  Not much.  Hanging.  Just hanging?  Yeah.  So you're going to the grand opening tonight, huh?  On the WWF, yes.  It's supposed to be a big event, Opie.  Have you been reading in the paper, like, television and movie stars are going to be  showing up and all kinds of people.  Sugar Ray performing.  Sugar Ray will be playing, performing tonight.  Guys, I must admit, I'm kind of bummed because I really wanted to go to that tonight. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And I'm thinking since you guys are going...  Oh, it's invitation only.  We are the special, privileged few, Opie.  Few.  We're going to...  There'll be like 3,000 people.  I know.  Who are you kidding?  You always feel special when you get an invite like this, and then you show up and it's  like, oh.  So your ticket's like, oh, look, everybody's here.  Yeah.  I wonder if that guy from New York won't be there with the big bushy eyebrows.  George Whipple or whatever his name is.  George Whipple.  Whatever his name is.  He's at everything. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Like, I went to one of those dopey parties for Maxim or something.  No, details.  Oops.  I went to the Maxim one.  Yeah.  You went to the Maxim one.  And you're walking around and you just see like that guy with the big furry eyebrows  and then a couple of other like pseudo-celebs, the Let's Get Ready to Rumble guy.  Yep.  And a couple of models.  But, oh, they're saying some bigwigs are supposed to be there tonight, Opie.  Well, we're very excited.  Right after the show, we're going to head on down there.  Hob-knobbing.  We'll be...  Better than knob-hobbing.  Yeah.  Don't confuse it with hob-knob. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, Debbie, I'm sorry.  We can't invite you to this one.  No.  All right.  How about some Raw's War tickets then?  Come on, guys.  I think, yeah.  Be good to me.  Yeah, my brother can't win the prize, so we'll give you the pair of tickets.  How's that?  That he was supposed to win.  You're the best, guys.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Actually, they're right here.  You got the WWF Raw's War and Madison Square Garden tickets.  That's for February 28th.  It's before you can buy them.  Tickets go on sale Monday, January 24th at 10 a.m.  Spaz will take good care of you, Debbie, all right? 
[01:31:30]  Listen, guys, you suck.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Later.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  And we'll be back.  We found the Delta commercial.  Y'all be going on vacation?  See, the thing is, if you about to be up out this bitch, check it.  Deep Delta.  We be flying all over this bitch.  Let me ask you something.  You fin to raise up and get your travel on?  From the interior to the exterior, you've got to get your posterior in one of these big-ass planes.  Shit, dog. 
[01:32:00]  You lay in the cut straight sitting on your ass and getting your drink on and your snack on while we floss and fly this mofo all over this bitch.  East Coast, West Coast, it don't matter.  Nia, we'll get you to your hoe and back lickety splits.  No shit.  Then you'll be back at your crib chilling with a flat spliff, thinking we were some crazy-ass angel.  Hell, these fat, brown, thick-ass vessels run up in the sky so deep, it'd be crying.  Yeah, you thought it was rain.  So bring a towel, because at Delta, it's laid out like that. 
[01:32:30]  Call one of these fly-ass Delta coochies, and make all them punk-ass co-workers of yours catch the vapors as you be off and about.  You going?  We fly you there.  You been?  We done already flew up in there.  We got you covered like a jimmy hat.  At Delta, we loves us some flying, and it'd be showing like a motherfucker.  That could be the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life, Anthony. 
[01:33:00]  Uh-huh, why?  Can't figure out why John Lovitz is not on TV anymore.  And Fidelity Diamond.  Yes, the engagement ring specialists.  Yeah, if you're going to be a sucker and, you know, like get engaged this, uh, Valentine's Day.  Hey, Ann, you want to talk about getting engaged?  No.  How about you do this, Reed?  You know all about marriage and getting engaged. 
[01:33:30]  Why don't you?  You'll probably get engaged at some point.  Ah!  Well, maybe engagement isn't right for everybody, but if you're going to get engaged, remember these two words.  Fidelity Diamond.  No.  No, pre-nup.  I'll be ixnay.  What?  This is supposed to be for a very, uh, loving people that are going to be getting engaged.  We're very, we're very honest on this show, Anthony.  Sure, a lot of people will be getting engaged this, uh, Valentine's Day, and if you, if you, if you gotta do it, you know. 
[01:34:00]  I bought you a box of candy, schnookums.  Oh, open it up.  Oh, it's a ring.  That's right.  If you're gonna break down and do it, you might as well do it the right way, right, Anthony?  Yes.  Fidelity Diamond, uh, the engagement ring specialist, these guys know what they're doing.  They give you an education.  Yeah.  You know, they, they go in, you go in, they show you the diamonds, they show you why it's a good diamond, they show you the setting, they pretty much put the whole damn thing together right in front of you, so there's no tricks going on. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, you don't know what's under that setting at the ring you bought at the department store.  I saw on, like, Dateline or, uh, 48 Hours or, uh, 60 Minutes or 60 Minutes 2, I can't figure out which show is what anymore.  Yeah.  But they had the hidden cameras where you pick out a really, really nice diamond, and they go in the back and they, they change it for a really crappy diamond.  Right.  Hey, that stuff scares the crap out of me.  Fidelity Diamond doesn't do that, obviously, because they do the whole thing right in front of you, they educate you, they tell you why it's a good diamond, they weigh it in front of you, they show you the setting, okay? 
[01:35:00]  Right.  And now through the end of Valentine's Day, buy your diamond engagement ring at Fidelity Diamond and get a platinum engagement ring setting for free.  For free.  That's a $500 value.  You can call Tom Colosino, president of Fidelity Diamond, for a confidential appointment at 201-261-6555.  That's 201-261-6555 for Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist. 
[01:35:30]  1027-W-NEW, it's Opie and Anthony.  What am I, Chuck Liver?  Oh, yeah, Paul's in here.  Truck driver Paul.  How are you there, Opie?  How are you feeling?  Opie.  Well, you know, hey, you know, I've been calling that for so long.  You know, when Opie was Opie and there was music happening, you know, I mean, I love music.  You know, and then you guys come along, and I used to call you Tweedle Dumber, Tweedle Dumber, and I had no more music.  Now the station ain't music.  You guys play a lot of music.  I can't figure the damn thing out. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, remember, we had you on one of our bits, didn't we?  Well, you locked me in a goddamn coffin.  That's not a bit.  You locked me in a coffin.  No, you're on the, uh, where's the Paul bit?  Oh, my God, that's going back.  Gee whiz.  That's before I even knew that I was on the air.  I'm trying to get somebody to pull a plug on you, Blackburn.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy used to call our boss all the time to try to get us fired when we were in the studio.  You've got to get them off the air.  These guys are terrible.  I wanted my music.  You know what good music is?  Well, maybe not dopey, but music. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, for me, you know, I know it works for me.  You know, because, like, I mean, I brought along something, you know, just for the hell  of it for later on, to show these muttonheads at N.E.W. what music was and why they should  have cared what the people thought.  I mean, I'm glad that you guys are here now, because I get to break your hookies.  You know what I mean?  What CD are you for?  What do you got?  Boy, I mean, you want to just hear a good song, a really rockin' tune?  Let me see it.  Let's see.  Put on, uh, which I think is probably one of the greatest songs ever written.  All right.  Wow.  Greatest songs ever written.  Yeah, but it's a rockin' tune. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, God.  Hey, don't say, oh, God, if it wasn't for that band, none of the music today would be  around.  Crank it up, you people.  Listen up.  Let me know what you think it is.  I'm going to embarrass you.  This is what he thinks is great music.  Well, only if you put on...  Listen to the lead, bitch.  You call me Eddie Van Halen and Nick White Mountain.  You can steal everything from this stuff.  Oh, wow! 
[01:37:30]  You can't listen to the music.  It's UFO.  UFO.  Lights out, right?  So you think UFO is, like, one of the greatest bands ever?  Well, you let the people here music, then you can bust a mic, Chuck.  I'm not even here to leave, but...  I think Eddie Van Halen did you steal anything.  I think it's...  The part is I'd rather hear this than Paul talk, so that's why... 
[01:38:00]  That's why I'm cracking it up when he tries to talk.  Oh, look at this.  Don't be the tactic.  What, Paul?  Come on.  We can't play this whole song.  Well, at least if you're going to the lead break, I'm not going to bust your horns for everything.  At least let the people hear the lead.  You mean like the 80s solo?  Is the 80s solo coming on?  What 80s?  This is way before the 80s.  Everybody's in the 80s spoken this.  Everybody's in the 90s spoken this.  Really?  Come on.  Kid Michael Schengen was 18 years old. 
[01:38:30]  Just like you in the mountains.  Oh, I'm waiting for the lead break.  I'm going to throw another chorus in.  It's all I did in the 70s was throwing choruses in.  Oh.  Oh, he's not letting me get my lead break in.  Oh, well.  What the hell?  Can I break your UFO, Sidney?  How pissed would you get?  Well, that one's hard to get, so I'd be pissed.  You don't have to.  Look how paranoid he's getting.  You know what it is?  Look how brave you are now, Paul.  Come on.  Just remember.  Oh, he's bending it.  He's bending it.  He's breaking you out, Paul.  Yeah.  Not at all.  I mean, I can get another copy.  You just don't have one here. 
[01:39:00]  How rare is it?  No, that's not rare.  That was a re-release in 92.  It's not rare.  My rare one's at home.  I don't get a bug.  He's getting freaked out.  No, what freaks me out is, he realized, after he locked me in a coffin, he was supposed  to give me all the music from any W's.  So I brought a trunk by just to get it.  And that guy, Robo Schween, the guy that lifted all the stuff with his, uh, was going  to carry it out for me that way.  Yeah.  And then I come here with a little guy that looks like a mole, gives me, gives me, uh,  um, uh, the, uh, so, Universal Soldier 2 soundtrack. 
[01:39:30]  What the hell?  That's not classic music.  Hold on, Paul.  You're making fans, uh, here on the, on the radio.  Ron, what's up?  I can't take this guy anymore.  You know what?  You got to live with him.  See, look, now you're on the other side.  Now you're on the radio, on the station, talking, and callers are calling up and ragging you.  Huh?  Send him over to CBS FM.  Well, he likes his UFO.  Here, here, Paul.  But, uh, speaking of CBS FM, by the way, uh, first of all, when I was coming home, I heard  you doing that, I swear, they were giving out bottles of liquor at the Midtown Tunnel. 
[01:40:00]  I saw cars swerving all over the place.  All right.  Absolutely incredible.  People slamming their dashboards.  I know they had to be listening to that.  Yeah.  That was the funniest friggin' thing.  Either that or really listening to CBS FM.  No, no, no.  Coincidentally, a lot of our listeners are swaying all over the, uh, road right now trying to  make it stop.  My chair just sort of, oh, Jesus.  Hey, what's up?  Please, fellas, what?  Take this 1977 reject, put him back in his donut truck, and let him go back to those 
[01:40:30]  different donuts or whatever he delivers, for God's sakes.  I mean, I can't understand what he's getting out of his mouth.  This is true.  No one's terrible, it sounds like.  Oh, you don't want to do what we have.  We're going to go back to those little bricks of the new ones.  I mean, it's like having a retarded dice clay in there, for Christ's sake.  Do you understand Latin?  Hey, let's do it.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Hey, you two guys, suck and blow.  All right.  Thank you.  Uh, Mike.  Yeah.  What's up?  Paul, what kind of crap do you listen to?  Well, let me ask you, what do you listen to? 
[01:41:00]  I listen to some Limp Bizkit, corn, the good stuff.  And where they all get the music from.  If you pick up the CD, it's called Essential UFO.  You'll hear everything.  They're all Limp Bizkit, Pearl Jam, and the rest of them wahoos.  It's called crap.  That's what it is.  Well, then what you're listening to is crap.  What does that say for you?  Garbage.  I can't believe you actually hear 2000.  What are you listening to?  That's like, uh, Paul, Paul, that's like what the, uh, the old fathers used to say back  in like, uh, you know, the fifties and stuff. 
[01:41:30]  Dude, I love it.  They would say like, they all got it from Benny Goodman.  That's where all your music comes from, Benny Goodman.  So now you're sounding kind of like an old guy to our listeners.  Candlebox and you, that does you and whatever else.  I love stuff like that.  Yeah.  I love Pearl Jam.  I'm just saying this is where it all came from.  Okay.  And I'm saying if any W, which is now letting you guys play this music, if they would have  been smart enough to play the original stuff back then, they wouldn't be off the air and  have a, what's it, a, a, Methuselah and Colostomy here in the morning.  Whatever that phrase is. 
[01:42:00]  Jesus.  What a guy that named, the guy with a name like, likes ass in the evening.  What kind of stupid can these people be?  I mean, you guys are at least, uh, almost acceptable.  Was this the stuff you were writing outside in the lobby?  No, no, no.  I didn't write anything.  No, I didn't do anything.  You said do it off the top of my head.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, Paul, how old are you?  Seventeen.  Seventeen.  Why don't you, why don't you buy some music that aren't on seven inches anymore?  I mean, like, how old is this stuff?  Do you want to tell them my seven inches?  What?  I'm sorry?  I mean, like, how old is this stuff?  I don't know.  It came out in 92.  What's the name of the band again? 
[01:42:30]  You came out in 92.  You came out in 92.  I think that they left for their home planet the back five years ago.  And you should go back to yours, too.  Hey, by the way, don't be.  Who's the gay guy that looks like a young fag John Travolta that keeps running in and out of here?  Which one is that?  They look like a fag young John Travolta with that funny-looking hairdo.  They're running in and out of here all the time.  They look like a young fag John Travolta.  I don't know where.  Is that, are you saying John the Dump guy is, uh...  No, no, no.  He's got to dump out of you.  No, the guy that looks like a young John Travolta, but gay. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, Rick?  Oh, that's Puerto Ricci, the human douchebag?  That's right.  Wait, you think our producer Rick looks like a young John Travolta?  A fag version of it, sure.  That's Puerto Ricci.  You know why I call him a human douche, by the way?  What?  You're not a function of a douche, right?  Clean out the...  That's correct.  Now, whenever he starts talking on your show, the blood rushes right out of my head the same way.  He's such a douche.  Hey, you know, by the way, hey, Puerto Ricci, if you're out there, I've got a present for you. 
[01:43:30]  George, what's up?  Oh, Ron, Ron, Roddy.  Let's get rid of this dick and crawl out of the station.  All right, very good.  Kevin from the Bronx saying, guys, is it possible to train a guy who's in the studio?  Get this ass off the air.  Khalid.  Wow.  Hi, what's up?  Hi, everyone.  This guy, all due respect, I think Paul is his name.  He sucks so bad, I'm going to listen to CBS FM until he gets off.  Oh, boy.  Has Paul been sucking on his tailpipe? 
[01:44:00]  Oh, my God.  What makes these people think I drive a truck?  Huh?  Can you train a guy that's in the studio?  That's an excellent suggestion.  Yeah.  All right, Khalid.  Thank you.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, you're not getting rave reviews here.  Now I know how you guys felt when I was busting your hoops.  See?  Exactly.  A little bit different when the shoe was on the other foot.  All the instant feedbacks, every single one of them are saying, throw this guy out of the studio.  I love it.  That means they're listening.  You didn't make points, you know, breaking out your UFO CD.  Oh, I don't care.  You've got to start out with something, and you know the best reaction was going to be from playing something old, though. 
[01:44:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Light out by UFO.  Come on.  Sure.  Why the hell not?  Does anyone like him on the instant feedback yet?  No one.  Of course not.  They're not supposed to.  I'm a bull buster.  Would you like to try out for the radio chick show?  Oh, God.  She's taking auditions.  No.  No?  No.  All right.  I don't do it full time.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I think I figured out what UFO stands for.  Yeah.  It's unbelievably effing awful, because it's fucked. 
[01:45:00]  You spell awful with an O?  Awful with an O.  Where are you doing?  That's the band to listen to if you want, to everybody.  Somebody write that down.  Now he's cursing.  Very good, Tim.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Take care.  I didn't know you spelled awful with an O, but.  People are making fun of me.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that is funny.  You could, like, hang in the studio, but we might have to turn your mic off.  Let me give you guys presents first before I go.  You got presents?  Of course. 
[01:45:30]  UFO CDs?  No, no.  Seats for the next content.  Come on.  Of course.  Al, you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  This is Nicky.  Hi, Nicky.  What's up?  This is Nicky, the drunk-talked the trail driver.  Remember me?  Oh, yeah.  I do.  This guy's horrible.  All right.  I'm better than he was.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm driving in the truck.  Paul, let's see your prizes or whatever you got.  What do we got?  Anthony, because Anthony's my favorite on the show, as you know. 
[01:46:00]  Look at that.  Security.  Security.  Squids in American sauce?  Right.  Now, the reason I got your squid, the reason I was bringing you a watch, but after Sal gave  you a whooping and you no longer have a backbone, I got to get your squid, because that has no  backbone either.  That's that.  You're mentally...  You're insane.  Where's Puerto Rican?  I got to have a present, too.  What do you got?  I got no backbone.  Well, I got him some...  Go see if he's out there. 
[01:46:30]  Seriously.  Good move, O.  Goddamn brilliant.  I knew where you were going.  He sends him out to find Rick, and Opie just locks the door on him.  He's knocking on the door. 
[01:47:00]  He's mooting on.  I saw that happen.  It's like, why don't you go out and see if you can find Rick?  Opie stands up, runs for the door, and slams in and locks Paul out of the studio.  Brilliant move.  Thank you, sir.  Cool.  All right.  We got to regroup.  Thank you.  Remember the time he called in when we first started here at N.E.W., Anthony?  Yes.  This is a favorite from the O&A archives.  Check this out.  Hello, N.E.W.?  Oh, yes.  Hi. 
[01:47:30]  It's the program director.  Uh, no.  Who's this?  Oh, okay.  No, I just have a little bit of a complaint.  All right.  Who's this?  Oh, no.  Hi.  My name's Paul.  The two gentlemen that are on the radio now...  Paul, I'm just an intern.  Let me get the program director you want?  Yeah, or somebody, please.  Okay.  Hold on a minute, please.  I just want you guys to...  Engineering.  Hi, Engineering.  How are you?  All right.  Can you guys do me a favor?  What's...  What's the...  I'll give you guys a hundred bucks cash under the table to pull a plug on him to blab him.  I'll come to play some music.  Oh, you want programming?  This is Engineering, sir. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, programming, please.  Oh, please hold.  Yeah, hello.  Hello.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, uh, do me a favor.  I'll give somebody in programming, whoever it is, I'll give them like five hundred bucks  under the table to shut these guys up for a little while, play some music or something.  What are you talking about?  This is the jock lounge.  This is whose house?  Uh, the jock lounge.  Oh, the jock...  Oh.  Where the DJs hang before they go on the air.  Oh, no.  They keep...  They keep transferring me around.  I want to talk to somebody.  Um...  I mean, these guys are a little...  They're ridiculous today.  You know, let them...  They call themselves disc jockies.  Let them throw on some discs. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Something.  You want the PD or the general manager?  Uh, I guess the program director would be fine.  I'm not here to bother the general manager.  Maintenance.  Ha, ha, ha!  Hello?  That's great.  You got the grade.  Okay.  Very funny.  That's pretty cool.  Maintenance.  But, yeah, you guys keep ping-ponging me around.  Is there any way to shut those two dudes up?  You want programming, sir?  Sure.  Why not?  I'll hang out and play the game.  Go for it.  Programming.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm trying to get...  I'm trying to talk to somebody to keep Tweedledum and Tweedledum and just a little bit quieter 
[01:49:00]  and play some more tunes.  Is that possible?  Who's Tweedledee and Tweedledum?  No, Tweedledum and Tweedledum.  And them two yahoos you got blabbered on the radio.  They sound like two old women from Long Island.  Is there any way to keep them quiet, you two, GJ, and just play a couple of more tunes?  Is that possible?  So you're looking for programming?  I don't know who they got me looking for now.  Where did I get now?  I apologize.  We're having a problem with the phone system.  Can you hold on one last second?  Hey, no problem.  I'm cool.  All right.  Hold on.  You've reached 1-900-Suck-My-Gay-Male-Sex. 
[01:49:30]  If you like big fists up your ass, stay on the line.  You'll get a hot ass right in your mouth to blow ass ass all over that face of yours.  How?  What a day, what a day. 
[01:50:00]  It's O&A.  Here, man.  Didn't mean to make that rhyme.  From 1027-WAW, 212-757-1027, if you have anything for the program today, Anthony.  Yes.  What's going on with Hillary?  Well, she met with the Reverend Al.  Met with Al Sharpton.  And, of course, that's what she has to do to make it look like she's involved with everybody in every community. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  Although, I think she's in the lead as far as hugging small black children in our city.  Because I, quite frankly, have not seen Giuliani hug one little black child.  And Hillary's just been like, she's all over.  She's going to the Bronx.  She's going to Harlem.  She's all over.  She's in Brooklyn hugging black children. 
[01:51:00]  So then she shows up at this Reverend Al thing for Martin Luther King's birthday.  And she talks to the people there and says, when she met the Dr. Martin Luther King, she met him when she was 15 years old and shook his hand that it changed her life forever.  Forever.  Yeah.  And she was inspired to go into public service at that moment.  A 15-year-old little Hillary Rodham shaking the hand of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King. 
[01:51:30]  And it inspired her.  I think he was just trying to spin around to see that big, fat, white ass in her.  Because he liked the white ass.  Well, there have been stories that, you know, Dr. King was into white women.  Mm-hmm.  You know.  Why not?  You know, who cares?  He had a little thing.  Like, I hope he's got a little thing for black women.  Yes, I do.  You know, maybe Dr. King had something for the white women.  And Hillary fits the whole profile. 
[01:52:00]  You know.  Right.  With that big, fat, white ass.  God, does anyone believe in her at this point?  No, she's all over just trying to look politically correct.  That's all she's doing.  Trying to look politically correct.  I like big, fat, white ass.  I like big, fat, white ass.  That was from the I Have a Dream speech, I believe. 
[01:52:30]  A little snippet.  You all remember.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, and she meets with Reverend Al.  You keep me on that one.  I love that part.  Why would she even give this guy any credibility?  Reverend Al.  Because she feels she needs the black vote to win.  Right.  To win.  That's it.  She had like 300 people yelling, run, Hillary, run.  And if we ever went to the black community, they'd be yelling the same thing.  Run, run. 
[01:53:00]  But for different reasons.  We'd be yelling, run, to each other.  Louie, what's up?  Hey, Owen, you know, it's so ridiculous why this Hillary kisses all that black ass,  because, number one, blacks vote democratic no matter what.  So if every other word out of her mouth was nigga this and nigga that, they'd still vote  for, so it's like a joke.  Why is she even like kissing all their asses?  Preaching for the converted.  I just don't understand what it's all about.  I mean, this woman, all she talks about is what she's going to do for the blacks and the 
[01:53:30]  Hispanics.  Why would any white voter in their right mind vote for this board?  She says nothing about the white people.  All she cares about is blacks and Hispanics.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  She doesn't even care about them.  She cares about one person, Hillary.  That's it.  Well, that's true.  I just don't get it.  I mean, 70% are going to vote for her no matter what.  So why does she, that's why Giuliani's not even wasting his time.  If he said, I'm going to give all blacks repercussions from slavery, I'm going to give each guy  a hundred dollars, or whatever they call it. 
[01:54:00]  Reparations.  Reparations.  Reparations.  I'm going to give each black child in New York City like a hundred bucks.  I'm going to give him a hundred dollars and a concussion.  They're not going to vote for the guy no matter what, so he's playing it right.  He's not kissing their ass.  I just hope people aren't buying it out there.  She's a complete phony.  The one thing about the mayor, you know, I'm not a huge fan.  Don't get confused again here, but he's as real as they get, you know?  He's as real as they get all in.  And another thing, this city, seven years ago, I wouldn't have stepped foot in it. 
[01:54:30]  Now, this place is gorgeous.  I love it here.  Oh, come on.  You didn't like the three-ring Dinkins Circus that was going on here?  I couldn't.  When he was in charge?  I didn't like the mention of attendance.  The only thing I feel like about seven years ago was there was a lot more prostitutes out  here, which was good, and a lot more porn flicks.  All right, Louie, thank you.  Oh, my God.  Louie, checking in about Hillary.  Tim, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up?  All right.  I just want to say, Opie, you'd do great with the black community.  You like black women.  You like big, black, hairy man asses. 
[01:55:00]  Easy.  I bet you'd do with Nick and Charlie if you had the chance.  Easy.  Oh, my God.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, listen, man.  You do it.  There's a lot of crap you're talking about with the president like that.  The president?  We didn't even mention the president this time.  Yeah, you're talking about Hillary, right?  That's the president.  Oh, okay.  And now, Opie.  Yeah.  Why don't you take your balls out of Sandy's purse?  I don't get that.  Well, you got no balls, because you guys do everything she does to do, right?  I don't think so.  If you listen to the show, that's not true at all. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, come on.  The pumpkin pick, you little fig.  Come on, man.  All right.  Come on.  All right.  You got me on that one.  I shared with you guys, and I get nothing but abuse about it.  Yeah.  All right.  Just listen to this.  Yeah.  This guy, Richie Newsday, he say, come down to the fight club.  Kick your ass.  No, the fight club is not happening lately.  Yeah, because you're a sissy.  Everyone's getting along.  Anthony, you're the man.  All right.  You're the man.  Thank you, Kevin.  Great.  See you.  An Anthony fan on the line.  Steve, what's up?  What's going on, O.A.? 
[01:56:00]  All right.  How's it going?  Great.  My comment on this whole Hillary mess is that, I'm not too big on politics, but I heard  that she might be indicted as far as some past stuff that her and old Willie have done.  No, I'm convinced there's nothing that will ever stick to those two.  Travel gate and all that crap.  Yeah, that's all old news.  No one would care anymore.  It's like crying wolf, you know what I mean?  Like anything they come up with.  It's the fact that it's even coming up, you know?  Granted, the guy's president now, and it's all surfacing. 
[01:56:30]  There's nothing you can do about it except, you know, accept it.  Nothing is going to happen to those two.  Nothing.  And Bill is such the lame duck, man.  You see?  I mean, when has Bill been in the news lately?  He's doing nothing.  He is sitting in that White House and says, I'm still president, but I don't do nothing.  And now I can't even get hammered.  Imagine if he didn't get caught what would be going on in the White House the last year  of his term.  There'd be a line out the door at this point.  Bill, it's like, do something. 
[01:57:00]  It's the last year.  Obviously, you can't run again.  It just goes to show you what this guy was all about, getting reelected, period.  That's it.  He doesn't care.  He's still got a year to go, and he's doing nothing.  Done nothing.  Well, he's talking about guns, Anthony.  Yeah, great.  Oh, that again.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  He's just afraid his wife's going to shoot him.  That's why he wants to get rid of guns.  He's going to find out other stuff I did.  He's going to find out other stuff.  Hi, this is Bill, and I feel your pain. 
[01:57:30]  That's why I'd like to tell the American people about a way to reduce the stress in your life  and help put a smile on your lips.  Introducing my all-new Big Willie Pop.  Suck on a Big Willie Pop, and you'll see why women everywhere just can't stop.  Made with all-natural ingredients, my Big Willie Pop has a cream center that is a great source of protein.  And, moms, you'll be happy to know that once you unzip my package,  your kids can suck on my Big Willie Pop all day. 
[01:58:00]  Hey, what do you have in your mouth?  Nothing.  Come on, you can tell me.  What are you sucking on?  Okay, don't tell anyone.  It's a Big Willie Pop.  Wow, can I taste?  Yeah.  Here, wrap your lips around this.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Hey.  Mmm.  Get that back.  Mmm.  Get that back.  Oh, my.  So listen and listen good, because I'm only going to say this once. 
[01:58:30]  Satisfy your craving and put my Big Willie Pop in your mouth.  Excuse me?  Can I have one?  Sure, Chelsea.  Come here.  Opie and Anthony.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from a private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Quickly, let's go to Lynn.  Lynn, what's going on today?  Hi, guys.  Hi. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you.  Good.  I just wanted to let you know, I just got home from work, and I was in Times Square this  afternoon, and I saw Spaz, and I think I, what's his name, Psycho Mark?  Yeah, Psycho Mark.  Well, I was dying, because I ran over to him.  I'm seeing that they had the wow sign.  So I ran over, and I'm like, guys, you're from Opie and Anthony, and they're like, yeah,  yeah, yeah.  And The Rock is at TRL tonight.  He was doing the TRL?  Yes, he was.  Yeah.  He was doing a great job, wasn't he?  Yes.  Boy, he could read teleprops. 
[01:59:30]  Well, you know what they were saying?  Huh?  They were screaming on the corner.  They were saying, well, I don't know if I could say this, but Rock's a girl thing, you  know.  Pussy.  There you go.  Rock's a pussy.  And they were also saying he sucks and everything, and everybody was yelling, and the cops were  like, all right, you guys got to calm down.  You guys got to calm down.  Well, The Rock's coming by tomorrow.  Yeah, I hear that.  Sometime after five, that's all we know.  I had to call you guys.  I was driving home, and you're like, you know, call, and, you know, they gave out the phone 
[02:00:00]  number.  I was like, let me go call, let me go call.  Oh, cool.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  They're going to rerun that tonight, TRL, with The Rock on it.  Yeah, because I told them I saw them last night on them.  Yeah, once again, Mark, all over the place with that wow sign.  Oh, yeah.  It took cold a while.  I didn't want to get out.  Oh, no problem.  Well, thank you, Lynn.  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  The Rock's a pussy.  The Rock's a pussy. 
[02:00:30]  The Rock's a pussy.  The Rock's a pussy.  The Rock's a pussy.  Jesus Christ.  Are you kidding me?  What?  You pushed the button.  I had nothing to do with that.  Oh, yeah.  That was me.  You're going to probably bump into the guy in another hour and a half.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You'll be fried if you do.  Hey, Jim.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  You know, Clinton did some stuff this year.  I got to admit, I don't like the guy, but he did some stuff.  What did he do? 
[02:01:00]  Well, he was brokering the Israeli peace talks.  He brought them back to the table when they were walking away.  Oh, please.  What American president hasn't done that?  Yeah.  I mean, they're always at the goddamn peace table.  Nothing ever gets solved.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  They like taking credit.  I thought that was over.  Didn't they have the shot of the two leaders shaking hands a million times?  What are they shaking hands over?  Nothing ever gets fixed.  That's true.  They get the money, though.  But the other thing he did was he reaffirmed Greenspan.  All right?  Oh, okay.  And he's got to make a decision. 
[02:01:30]  What was he going to do, change him and all of a sudden send the stock market into a tizzy?  That was a no-brainer.  Hey, what's he got to lose?  He doesn't care.  I mean, think about it.  He's probably got his investments to lose.  Oh, he cares a lot.  Yeah, probably does.  You know.  Go ahead.  He's got to make the anti-missile decision on whether they go forward with that in the next couple of months.  Oh, that thing doesn't work.  Yeah, so far, anyway.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyway, about the rock thing, guys.  Yeah.  Why were you?  I call him sick tomorrow.  Yeah.  It's not going to be pretty.  I'm going to be listening, too. 
[02:02:00]  We'll see what happens.  We'll be here.  The funny thing is, Ant and I are going to the opening of the WWF restaurant tonight.  Yeah.  There's no way we're going to even get close to the rock tonight.  Everyone's like, oh, my God, aren't you guys scared?  He's going to be there, and you're going to be there.  Our paths aren't even going to cross.  You don't think so?  There's going to be, like, 2,000 to 3,000 people there, I think.  You better hope he doesn't have somebody watching for you.  Just in case, I got a good disguise anyway.  Hey, man, I'll keep my fingers crossed for you guys.  You're great.  All right, Jim, thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  I don't know. 
[02:02:30]  What if he searches you out?  Fine.  He sees you across the room.  Fine.  You don't move your candy ass.  Take your best shot.  Why don't we have, like, a cutout of the rock in the studio?  Look.  Look, Ant, you can practice the interview.  Is that actual size?  Yeah, it's actual size.  No.  We got a lifelike, yeah, that's, like, actual size rock right there.  That's actual size.  That's actual size.  Yeah, we saw it.  Definitely.  All right, Ant's like, oh, Ant just punched the rock in the head. 
[02:03:00]  I just punched it right in the face, Opie.  Did you see that move?  Boy, you're a brave guy, Anthony.  Yeah, he went down, too.  Ant's 1 and 0 and fight, though.  Hey, Rich.  Yo.  We got you on the air.  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie.  It's Rich from Budweiser, everyone.  Hey.  How you doing, man?  What's up?  Listen, I want you guys to be our guest, being you are promoting Budweiser, Monday night,  being your big Knicks fan.  Huh?  Against Seattle.  Oh.  In the suite, baby.  I'm there. 
[02:03:30]  You, Anthony, Rick and Stiles, and I'll be there, too.  You want to go in?  I don't like basketball.  Yeah, but you like Budweiser.  I want to go to some, like, you know, ranger games.  You'll have some great food, great games.  Hang out.  Have some fun.  Rich, hold on the line.  Rick will talk to you, but I'm in.  All right, man.  All right, thanks.  How come basketball, basketball, basketball, up-the-ass basketball, the boss takes you  to the basketball game?  I can't get crap as far as football, when football season, when the Jets and Giants were still 
[02:04:00]  playing, or hockey.  Jesus Christ.  They offered us the Jet ticket.  Basketball.  It just goes to show you how much basketball sucks.  You know when they offered us...  They have plenty of tickets to go around.  They offered us the Jets tickets when they were sucking so bad.  I'd still go to the game, because it's kind of fun.  Yeah.  You know?  But I mean, oh, God, basketball, who cares?  They're offered Islander tickets all the time.  I might even go to Islander games.  That would be kind of fun.  But basketball, oh, God, I couldn't sit there and watch it. 
[02:04:30]  Thum, thum, thum, thum, thum.  Thum, thum, thum, thum.  Thum, thum, thum, thum.  Everyone wants to talk about Hillary.  I mean, there's really nothing there.  Uh, call W-O-R at one of those stations if you want to talk about Hillary.  Yeah, please.  Is Bob Grant still on opposite us?  Do we know anymore?  Bob Grant.  We'll talk about the issues.  Hillary Clinton, a hose bag. 
[02:05:00]  You slut whore.  Screw that.  A couple rocking tunes instead.  My favorite Beastie Boys song right after ACV says,  2027-WNEW.  All right, hold on.  I had to cut into a song here.  You guys are a bunch of asses.  Let me just read a couple things here, okay?  All right?  Mark from Jersey, you're an effing tool, you big freaking loser. 
[02:05:30]  Rick, get Rick in here.  Mark from Jersey, hey, open it.  That Big Willie Poppet was on Howard already.  God, you have to just keep stealing bits, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Hold on.  I want to call all these losers out.  There's millions of them.  They're just sitting here waiting.  Uh, that Big Willie Poppet has already been played on Stern 10 billion times. 
[02:06:00]  God, can you get original?  Oh, get original.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  We can't, I guess.  In the studio, Rick, the producer of our radio show.  Rick, who came up with the Big Willie Poppet?  Um, let me think a second.  I remember hearing that.  Me.  I came up with that.  It's Rick's bit that Howard has stolen.  And who's the chick?  Who's the chick on it?  Um, let's see.  One of the female voices, the one who's sucking on it when it pops is, oh, what's her name?  It's my wife, Linda. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  And it isn't a different version.  It is the same one.  It's the only version.  Howard is playing Rick's bit.  Right.  Right.  That is the one Rick did.  Right.  So if anyone was stealing a bit or playing a bit that belonged to someone else, Howard played that, and it's Rick's bit.  Right.  See, it's so hard to believe that your king rips off other jocks, but you know what?  The fact is, he does, you losers.  But he told us that it was his, you losers. 
[02:07:00]  It's so funny how they got an email in and say, oh, we can't get original.  That's pretty original.  It's Rick's.  Hey, Mark, what are you going to say now?  It's Rick's bit with his wife on the bit, you ass.  But Howard doesn't rip off anyone, sure.  He's perfect, you loser.  And my buddy Steve doing the voice of Clint.  There you go.  Great.  And that's not the only one that he plays over there that has originated from our show.  Trust me.  Trust me on that one. 
[02:07:30]  But then we play it.  We play our own stuff.  We play our own stuff, and we're ripping him off.  He took it and played it on each other.  That's hysterical.  Back to the music.  Loser.  I'm going to have some sushi today and bitch about Howard.  Yeah, if Jackie the Joke Man is listening, or if anyone knows Jackie the Joke Man, you  really got to tell him to keep his voice down when he's having sushi at the Fuji restaurant  on 56th Street. 
[02:08:00]  Ben and I were two tables behind you hearing you bitch about every single person that works  at K-Rock.  I write everything that puppet Howard says.  I'm being polite by not talking about it, because I feel bad that he didn't realize  I was two tables away as he's pitching about the money he doesn't make.  I want money!  And that he's the whole show.  And that Billy West was brilliant.  Well, I heard it all today, Jackie.  Keep your mouth down next time you're in a sushi restaurant on 56th Street. 
[02:08:30]  Back to the tunes.  It's ACDC, 1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  It's Sophie and Anthony.  Beastie Boys.  Sabotage.  ACDC.  Before that, having lots of fun today.  212-757-1027 if you have anything for the program.  Let's go to Greg and see what he has today.  Greg, what's up, man?  Yo, what's happening, bro?  Hi.  Hey, I was listening to you guys talking about hearing Howard playing that bit.  He was playing a really, really bad, I guess you'd call it a remake of the old lady calling 
[02:09:00]  the hardware store for the cock.  Yeah, that's all right.  Did anybody hear anything about that?  It wasn't your version.  It sounded like some blatantly gay man trying to do the same thing.  No, we could explain that one, too.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, and did a prank call to a hardware store.  If Rick's around, if he could find the cock bit, it'd be greatly appreciated.  I wish I'd taped the other one.  I'd send you a copy of it.  No, no.  It was almost offensive.  It was so bad.  We could completely prove it, because now every time we play our bit, the cock bit, which 
[02:09:30]  is much funnier than the one Howard plays, everyone calls us and says, hey, you're ripping  off Howard.  That was on Howard's show.  That's Howard's bit.  Well, let's explain it to you, okay?  When we're in Boston, because that's where it makes sense, because it's a Boston accent,  saying the word caulk, okay?  So we called a hardware store, making believe we're an old lady looking for a caulk, okay?  Blah, blah, blah.  It makes sense if you're in Boston.  It makes everyone laugh really hard, okay? 
[02:10:00]  Red Peters, who is a very good friend of our show.  I'm familiar with Red Peters.  And he's been on Howard's show as well.  Yeah.  When we put out our CD, Demented World, unfortunately, we did that bit right after we put out the  CD.  But Red Peters came to a bunch of our signings going, man, that dead caulk bit.  I like that.  Caulk.  Caulk.  I got that caulk.  All right?  And he would do all the lines from our prank call and stuff, okay?  You fast forward a couple of months. 
[02:10:30]  Red Peters is on Howard's show, and Red did the bit for Howard.  Oh.  That's how that happened.  It's like he doesn't even acknowledge you guys anymore.  He's always, you know, how he's always been ranking on everybody who refills his competition  to him.  Whatever.  I mean, I don't carry the way, but I'm not going to sit here and, you know, listen to  the crap when it's not true.  I leave him on my alarm clock, so I actually have to get up and shut it off.  I mean, the big Willie Pop bit that we just played, because Hillary's in the news and  stuff, is Rick's bit, our producer's bit. 
[02:11:00]  It's his wife on the bit.  Oh, I remember hearing it a year and a half ago.  All right?  And Howard plays it, because Rick, I guess, sent a copy before he started, you know, working  with our show or something.  I don't know how that actually happened.  Is that how it was, Rick?  I'm not going to sit here and, like, lie about it.  But, all right, Rick sent a copy over to Howard.  They play it all the time, but it's Rick's bit.  Yeah, I was unemployed at the time, but I was sending out bits to Opie and Anthony.  And, actually, I think you guys got that first.  We did play it first.  We played it first in Boston. 
[02:11:30]  Like, whatever.  I don't even...  And then Gary called me.  I'm not debating.  I thought I'd point it out.  I didn't know if anybody else picked up on it.  But a lot of people pick up on the Quark one, too.  And I swear...  Quark!  I swear that's all...  It sounded like...  Yeah.  It sounded like still the old man trying to do the bit.  Right.  Well, we're trying to find it so we can play it really fast for...  All right, hey.  It's on one of the Boston CDs.  I mean, it's a really old bit that we did.  All right, Greg.  Thank you.  All right, hey.  You guys rocking.  The rock eats ass.  All right.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:12:00]  I'm trying to find it.  Hey, Jeff.  What's going on?  Jeff?  Hello.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Are you guys...  When you have the rock over, is he going to be in a separate studio than you guys?  I don't know.  Your own safety?  Well, I don't know how we're going to handle it, to be honest.  I mean, because if you lock that half-breed in another room, you should have Corky interview  him, so you have someone on his same brain level talking to him.  Well, I know there's a couple locked doors, you know, and we're going to have Rock a couple  locked doors away, and we're going to have Rick with our cell phone to see what his mood 
[02:12:30]  is before we invite him into the studio.  You've got to watch out.  I mean, he could just run right through the wall.  He ain't got nothing to protect.  Well, and then in the studio, we're going to have, like, two huge cops, one behind Anthony  and one behind myself, because, let's face it, we're a bunch of pussies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I was just saying, I mean, I don't know if you could probably relate to Corky, you  know, kind of on the same mental level as him.  I hope we get some footage and snapshots of the cops.  It's going to be pretty funny, because the Rock's going to be over there about, what, 
[02:13:00]  10, 12 feet away.  Yeah.  And we're going to be all tough and stuff, but right behind us, with their arms crossed, they're  going to be two huge.  Which, supposedly, they're bigger than the Rock.  The cops just watching our back.  Huh?  What is he a mix of?  Oh, whatever.  I mean, I don't know if he'd get scared by the cops, you know.  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, Jesus.  That's just making worse.  Is that right to recognize him for sitting in the backseat of a car?  I don't know, you know.  All right, Jeff.  Please.  Thanks a lot.  All right, bye.  Thanks a lot. 
[02:13:30]  Well, once again, you know, everyone's looking forward to tomorrow.  The Rock coming sometime after 5.  That's all we know.  I'm looking at the live webcast they have of the opening in this WWF restaurant opening.  Yeah.  Seems like some cameras going off and stuff in front of the place.  Seeing, boy, they've got to fix this damn digital imaging over the web.  You know, it's supposed to.  That's another thing that the future was supposed to bring.  Remember that?  Like telephones with televisions on them? 
[02:14:00]  And you're watching stuff.  You're supposed to have a little TV.  All right, I punched into the webcast.  It's all grainy and everything.  Let me see.  Turn around.  Turn the computer down.  I think it's a little postage stamp of Times Square.  Actually, that's not bad.  I've seen worse than that.  I've seen worse, but it should be crystal clear.  Maybe if I can make it bigger.  Yeah, make it bigger.  Let me see.  No, no, it's really bad.  Let me see.  It's a little cuby.  From a distance, it ain't bad.  It doesn't seem like there's a lot of people there yet.  Isn't it starting at 630? 
[02:14:30]  I think.  And are we going to get in?  We get invited to stuff, and we're like, hey, man, look, special invite.  We've been invited to your little party here with all the big celebrities.  And like, so is everyone else.  Get to the back of the line.  Get to the back of the line.  And then there's a line with like 1,000 people on it.  And there's already like 3,000 people inside.  And now you have to wait.  Like, you know, when you go into a crowded bar and you have to wait for a few people to leave.  We're like, oh, great.  We thought we were special.  Yeah, we're special, all right.  I know, because the invites always look all fancy and stuff. 
[02:15:00]  We've got the limos pulling up and people getting out, but I can't see who's getting out.  No?  No.  And more people taking pictures.  It's like a big blurry guy.  All right.  Oh, wow, big blurry guy just arriving.  Well, we'll find out for ourselves in about, what, a half hour we'll be down there, okay?  All right, let's play the cockpit, Ant.  All right.  It doesn't even really make as, it's not as funny if you're from New York.  You've got to know the Boston accent.  Yeah.  Because the word caulk sounds a lot like.  Caulk.  Right.  I need caulk. 
[02:15:30]  So there it is.  This goes back a ways.  It's from the O.P. and Anthony archives.  Check it out.  Old lady looking for some caulk.  Thank you for choosing.  Thank you for choosing.  Thank you for choosing.  Hello, man.  Yes.  Hello, miss.  I'm an elderly woman.  I just moved to you from Boston.  Oh, that's a good copy.  That's a dirty CD.  Hold on.  Clean that up.  No, no, no, no, no.  Clean it up.  I mean, look how I clean CDs, Ant.  I see.  There's dust all over that thing.  We haven't played this in a long time.  Oh, they just zoomed in on someone. 
[02:16:00]  I can't see who it is.  You can't make it out, though?  They've got the video cameras on them and flashes and everything, but I can't tell who it is.  Is it a chick?  It's Flurry Woman.  It's Flurry Woman joining Blur...  Oh, no.  China, it looked like.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Oh, it's Flurry Guy.  Flurry Guy.  Are we bringing a DAT recorder to get some audio from this thing tonight?  We could.  We should.  All right, let's play the cockpit, and right after commercials, we'll play What Did We Learn  on the Opie and Anthony Show today, okay? 
[02:16:30]  All right.  212-757-1027.  Thank you for choosing...  Hello, ma'am.  Yes.  Hello, miss.  I'm an elderly woman.  I just moved here from Boston, Massachusetts, and I have a leaky bathtub.  Uh-huh.  I believe I need caulk to fill in the hole.  Do you need...  Pardon me?  I need caulk.  Okay, please hold.  Thank you for holding.  We will be with you shortly.  Oh.  Yes, I'm in desperate need of caulk.  The old caulk just ain't working anymore.  Okay.  Over in the paint department, they have GE silicone they got for that. 
[02:17:00]  Is that good caulk?  Sure is.  And that works good in the bathtub?  Sure does.  Can I speak to someone in the paint department?  Sure.  Hold on one second.  You should call back...  Hello, miss.  I need caulk.  You need caulk?  No, I need caulk.  If I needed caulk, I would have said caulk.  Clark.  Does he supply the caulk?  Can you spell this for me?  C-A-U-L-K.  Caulk.  Please hold. 
[02:17:30]  Hello?  Paint department.  Hi, I need caulk.  Huh?  I need caulk.  Clark?  Caulk.  Yeah?  I need caulk.  Okay.  Because I own a house now, and all the caulk in my house is all dried up.  Okay.  I need some brand new caulk.  You carry caulk?  You need caulk?  Yes.  I need caulk for my bathtub.  Um, what kind?  Just, uh, what kind of color are you looking for?  I don't really care.  I like white caulk, but, uh, I'll take any color. 
[02:18:00]  The caulk that's in my house is all dried and cracked.  And it's leaky caulk.  I need new caulk.  All right.  Well, we got all sorts of shapes and varieties here of caulk for you, you know.  All kinds of shapes of caulk?  Oh, yeah.  We even have one that's about two feet long.  Really, Doc?  A tube, yeah.  Well, that's a lot of caulk.  Yeah.  I probably could use that much.  Yeah, a lot of people could.  Thank you, sir.  You've been very kind.  Also, we have some, uh, some special guns to attach to the caulk, you know. 
[02:18:30]  Get a little more width there.  Caulk?  Gun?  Yep.  Oh, that sounds very exciting.  I'll have to come down.  All right.  We got plenty for you.  Thank you very much.  And if you don't see anything on the shelf you like, some of our employees have their own  that they give to you.  Their own special brand of caulk?  Oh, yeah.  That's wonderful, darling.  Yeah, we do everything for you here.  Thank you very much, son.  We even, uh, send someone over to your house sometimes to help you use it.  To help me install the caulk?  Yep.  Don't install it for your real life.  Somebody could help me put the caulk in, really. 
[02:19:00]  That's right.  That's wonderful.  All right.  So you have a good day, man.  Thank you, son.  Bye.  Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Sorry about that.  If Opie was taking Stacker, he would have, uh, hit the mic sooner.  I would have been a little quicker.  Yeah.  Not as lethargic.  Right in.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Hope, uh, people got to lose some weight. 
[02:19:30]  There's some fat people out there.  Some pudgy people.  They bulked up over the winter and, uh, hey, you're going to have to lose that weight.  Stacker 2 is the way to do it.  Yeah, don't wait for, uh, the springtime to hit.  No.  You got to start now to get rid of that bunt.  That Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Well, burn away the bunt.

[02:20:00]  Right.  So you're not peering out at the end of your work day.  And, uh, you won't get those cravings to snack on junk food.  It, like, curbs your appetite, as they say.  And it all adds up to losing weight, Anthony.  Yes.  They also have a website, stacker2.com, or give them a call, 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.

[02:20:30]  Thousands have proven it works.  All right, we're back for the final segment of the Opie and Anthony show today.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I believe it's time to play What the Hell Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Because we've got to get out of here.  We've got to go to the, uh, the opening of the WWF restaurant, Anthony.  Oh, I've been, uh, keeping tabs on it on this, uh, live streaming video.  And I can't see anything.  I saw a big guy with dark hair, so I figured that was China. 
[02:21:00]  We have a life-size, uh, cutout of the rock in the studio.  Yeah.  And Psycho Mark is humping me.  It's like live-size, yeah.  And, uh, Mark is also having the rock.  He's getting the rusty trombone now from the rock cutout.  The rock is orally, uh, measuring Psycho Mark.  Very good.  Psycho Mark, take your, take your turn.  We've been beating, uh, the hell out of the cutout all day.  Give him a punch. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, he's done.  Yeah, the cardboard rock.  The cardboard rock, yes.  Doug, what's up?  Yeah.  Oh, hey, how you doing?  Real good.  Hey, uh, I was just wondering, after the rock, uh, did you guys tomorrow?  Yeah.  Where do we send flowers to?  Yeah.  Or, or maybe, uh, you can get that guy, Tom Likas, to take your place.  Uh, I think he needs a good-ass ticket.  Uh, in lieu of flowers, send your donations to the Brain Injury Clinic. 
[02:22:00]  Because then I'm sure we'll just be like, hi, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  It'll be interesting tomorrow, sometime after five with the rock.  Okay, guys, I'll be listening.  Thank you, Doug.  Good luck.  All right, man.  Yeah, before we start, um, what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today?  Can we play computer guy real fast?  I just found this as we were digging for some old bits today.  Uh, a guy called into the, um, computer place with a complaint.  Right.  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  We could all relate, because we've all had our computers worked on, or you needed advice,  or, in this, in this guy's case, he, he, he sent the whole damn thing in for some serious work, right? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, and, uh, he wasn't happy with the results, so he called the, the, uh, the place back,  and just loses it.  He's pissed.  Check this out.  Hello, um, my name is Stephen Thrasher, and I sent my Canon laptop computer into it.  I just got it back.  Everything that I've written on it for the past few years is gone.  I was told that you guys were going, that, that I'd be called if you had to replace the hard drive.  I called Canon.  They said the hard drive didn't need to be replaced. 
[02:23:00]  They just said the motherboard didn't need to be replaced.  Everything that I've been working on for the first, now, goddamn fucking years of my life is gone.  You fucking assholes, now I want you to call me back, stop fucking me around,  and make sure that I get back what I've been working on.  Do you fucking understand me?  And I'm tired of you fucking around with me.  I am better to get my goddamn disc drive back.  I'm going to sue all of you fucking pieces of shit.  When nerds attack.  When nerds attack.  Everything I've been working on, all of my porno I've been downloading for two years. 
[02:23:30]  What happened to my child porno?  All right, let's go to the phones and play.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Let's start with Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, make Bridget cry?  Yeah.  Man, you guys aren't going to hell.  You're from hell.  Well, we weren't sure if we should, you know, move forward with that bit today,  but Bridget said it was okay to play make Bridget cry. 
[02:24:00]  That was harsh.  I must admit, it was tough to listen to.  But kudos to the family for bringing her down.  And the scary part is my brother was the one that ended up making her cry.  That's what I'm talking about.  Hey, another thing for you.  The Rock is supposed to be on another station up here in Connecticut tomorrow morning.  Great.  I don't know if you guys want to tune in.  Nah, we don't.  Get some ammunition for later on in the afternoon.  Nah, we don't need to.  We're just going to go with it.  All right.  We'll see what happens tomorrow.  Fair enough. 
[02:24:30]  All right, thank you.  Hey, you've got a good fan base up here.  Keep up the good work.  What part of Connecticut?  Fairfield.  Oh, right on, man.  Hey, hey, I'm going to go down to Greenwich and check out how the Moxley thing's coming along.  Oh, the trial?  Well, it's not a trial yet.  It's just an indictment.  They have been indicted, right, officially?  You know, I'm not even really sure.  All right.  It'll be all over the news site.  I'll check it out.  Yeah.  Hey, thanks, man.  Word.  All right.  They're talking with The Rock.  They're talking to The Rock on the webcast, Ant?  He's also, dude.  He's Dwayne.  He's Dwayne Johnson.  He's like, this is fabulous. 
[02:25:00]  Fantastic place.  There's another thing.  You can go up into the merchandise area.  You've got all the rocks.  Dolls, video games, videos.  He's vlogging.  Yeah, he's plugging his dolls and rock video games on a webcast.  All right.  We're going to be in the same building with him in about 20 minutes.  I hope more people are in there when we go there because, oh.  Mike, what's going on?  You can just look across the room and hit us.  Mike.  Today, I learned that even a horse can cry.  Okay. 
[02:25:30]  How's that one?  Very good.  You guys kept in the family, too, with the crying.  All right.  Very good.  Thanks.  Thank you, man.  Let's go to Chuck.  Chuck, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Well, you know, WRCN is 103.9.  Bridget's boyfriend might be gay, but I'm like a Hummer.  All right.  And if he gave Psycho Mark and Staz of Brett, they'd fit in with all the perfect other freaks.  All right.  Running out of New York.  Thank you.  That was absolutely horrible.  We almost wrecked our game. 
[02:26:00]  John, what's up?  You're next.  Yeah, I learned that The Rock has no place to writing a book because someone with, like,  three years of experience that grew up getting his handheld silver spoon fed to him to get  into the Federation, as opposed to someone like Foley that did everything.  You know, what's next?  The Mean Street Posse writing a book?  Well, I think China's next, and then eventually they'll get to the Mean Street Posse.  For who?  China's up next.  But China?  Vagina.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Wow, this game's not going too well today. 
[02:26:30]  Joe, what'd you learn on the show today?  Hey, I learned UFO stands for unbelievably friggin' awful.  Yeah, I never knew that awful begins with the letter O until today.  All right, guys.  Syndication now.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  What's your name?  Arthur.  Arthur, what's up?  What's happening?  I learned today that Jackie's Joke Man would no longer be eating sushi at the Fuji restaurant  anymore.  Not loudly, anyway.  Yeah, I didn't want to bring it up today until I got pissed off, but I was two tables behind 
[02:27:00]  Jackie as he was, like, bad-mouthing pretty much everybody today.  I'm the whole show.  I thought that was a bit.  I'm the whole show.  Hey.  I thought that was a bit on Howard's show, but we learned firsthand today.  You know what sucks, too, man?  Because this happens in Manhattan all the time, especially in this area, that people  don't care who's around when they just want to, you know, yell and scream and talk and  stuff.  Yeah.  So Ben and I, we're two tables away, and he is just bad-mouthing. 
[02:27:30]  I mean, you name him, he bad-mouthed him today, okay?  And all of a sudden, it's really getting good, the stuff he's starting to talk about.  Yeah.  And these two guys come in.  The restaurant is completely empty, except for Jackie, his friend who was just kissing  his ass, everything Jackie said.  Oh, yeah, you're right, Jackie, you are the greatest-mout-mout.  Right, Ben?  This guy was just licking ass.  And Ben and I are sitting there laughing, going, oh, my God, he has no freaking clue,  you know?  Then these two businessmen come in, and they have to be the loudest businessmen in Manhattan. 
[02:28:00]  So they're like another two tables away in the other direction.  Yeah.  So instead of hearing some great dirt about K-Rock and Howard's show and how miserable Jackie  is, right?  All of a sudden, I'm here.  Yeah, so I didn't really want to go to San Francisco, but they flew me out there.  I really wanted to be in Southern California, but San Francisco, well, you know, so I made  the best of it.  And then, you know, they flew me back.  I'm in Penn Station, and I had to go to Philadelphia after that. 
[02:28:30]  This guy is as loud as can be talking about his stupid business trips, and I'm like, will  you shut up?  This is like gold, what I'm listening to today.  But instead, no, we get loud business guy.  Just drowned out the whole conversation Jackie was having at that point.  And I'm like, oh, that figures.  You heard enough, though.  I heard that we were right about Billy West.  He got screwed over.  Yeah.  Thanks for that, Jackie.  That was interesting today. 
[02:29:00]  Why would you ever talk that loud in a restaurant?  I'll have the salmon.  I'll have some shrimp.  And some Heineken's.  And if anyone thinks I'm lying, call up their show tomorrow and ask Jackie where he had lunch  yesterday.  Do you have any lamb on a stick here? 
[02:29:30]  Around 1240.  Was he at the Fuji restaurant on 56th Street?  Put it all on Howard's tab.  I don't make enough money over there.  Hey.  That was interesting.  And I won't say who said this, so I can't get in trouble.  They said the Howard Stern show would be nothing if it wasn't for Boy Gary.  Oh.  Hey.  I didn't say it was him.  Oh, man. 
[02:30:00]  You've got to keep your voice down when you go to these restaurants.  I'm telling you.  Let's see.  Let's go to Rich.  Hey, Rich.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Real good.  All right.  I learned today that no matter how great you two guys are, there's always going to be  some schmuck sitting there waiting to call up and say how much of a copycat you are.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  You guys are right.  You're not copycats.  Have fun tonight.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:30:30]  All right, guys.  I think the faithful listeners would know what the deal is.  Steve, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I learned today in the world of Paul that Rick is a Puerto Rican John Travolta.  That's true.  Actually, he's a young, gay John Travolta lookalike.  Hey.  Maybe he can stand in Greece.  Rick, you didn't even hear it.  I was expecting you to come running through the door when we had truck driver Paul in.  No, I was on the phone with the WWF and with some other future guest trying to get everything  straight, and then I come down the hall, and this is happening? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were waiting for you to bust through the door and, you know, throw your weight around.  That trailer trash-looking...  Well, he's gone now.  It's gone now.  Indian-looking guy?  You're as brave as Ant and I were after the rock left.  After the rock left, yeah.  Oh, of course.  Maybe there's a cardboard cutout of him you could punch around.  Good luck tomorrow.  All right.  Thank you.  Lisa, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hi, Owen.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  I learned that Opie's brother, Darren, needs some major therapy.  He's already in.  He needs more, though. 
[02:31:30]  And I think Anthony might be interested in getting a bottle of almond oil.  Sounded like you liked that idea.  Almond oil.  I was just fascinated with it that she came up with that.  I wonder where she learned it.  Pretty inventive.  That little whore.  Hey, you guys rock.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, Jackie, the Letterman bit wasn't as good as your pal was saying it was.  Kissing your ass and patting your ass.  I wrote the whole thing.  I wrote the whole thing.  I wrote it.  And then Robin stepped on the line.  That line was funny. 
[02:32:00]  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  My line was funny.  I wrote the whole thing.  How it just reads it like a puppet.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  I'm everything.  It was hilarious today.  It was so freaking funny.  All of a sudden, Jackie Cousley says to a friend, hey, did you hear the Letterman bit today?  Oh, Jackie, it was the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It was great.  It was mine.  It was mine. 
[02:32:30]  I can't understand why you're not making more money and as famous as Billy West with all your talent.  That's why they never had a Howard puppet, because he is one.  It would be redundant.  And then Howard's doing his lines and Robin stepped on one of the best lines of the bit.  Ow, ow.  Robin stepped on the lines.  It was funny.  It's Jackie too loud at Sushi Martling.  You ought to look around, man. 
[02:33:00]  Aaron, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned two things today.  I learned you try and do something good for someone, and it will end up blowing up in your face.  And there's no use crying over spilt milk unless you want to give your brother a prize. 
[02:33:30]  Very good.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's end with Matt.  Matt, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey.  All right.  I learned that the going rate for a dead 75-year-old with a brain tumor is only a couple grand.  Bingo.  Bravo.  Talking about the poor old lady that froze to death.  Oh, yeah.  On the top of the building last night, Anthony.  Yes.  Can we get Tom Likas on the top of a building in the cult?  I'm locked up. 
[02:34:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Let me in.  I'm freezing.  I went out of you a lot to burn.  All right, we got to get out of here.  Yeah.  Headed down to the WWF shindig down there.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Should be honest.  Oh, boy.  Well, tomorrow's going to be an interesting day.  The Rocks sometime after five.  See if we can make out who this is.  Who is that getting out of the limo?  Okay, they're opening the door.  Who is it?  Can you tell?  It looked like The Rock, but they were just talking to him. 
[02:34:30]  That's him.  Oh, they're just, what, they're showing The Rock's arrival?  Oh, great.  What a guy.  All right.  The Croc says, oh, and the people go wild across the street with the signs.  Well.  All right, we got to get out of here.  All right, man.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  And he's great every time he's on TV.  Shut up.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right.  At two.  Yes.  We'll be in the studio at two tomorrow.  With The Rock. 
[02:35:00]  Rock after five.  Yeah.  See ya.  O.B. and Anthony.  1027 WNAW. </pre>
