<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts joking about their cramped, cold studio, likening it to a womb.  The conversation transitioned to nighttime cell phone usage, alarm clock strategies, and the upcoming appearance of Ron Howard.  A significant portion of the early show focused on the comedic narrative of how intern David supposedly co-booked Howard, detailing his chaotic attempts to locate the show's booker and highlighting perceived shortcomings of a staff member, Steve C.  This included a humorous recounting of the scheduling conflict between Ron Howard and Andrew Dice Clay.  Opie's stage name and childhood nickname were also discussed.  A "Backstage with O&A" segment featured Jason Ellis giving David relationship advice, punctuated by jokes about David's appearance and musical taste.  The hosts then discussed David's remaining time at the show and his future plans, mocking his hairstyle and singing ability.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the Buffalo plane crash (Colgan Air Flight 3407), analyzing the cockpit voice recorder transcript.  The hosts focused on the casual conversation between the pilot (Renslow) and co-pilot (Shaw) before the crash, noting Renslow's attempts at flirting and the co-pilot's increasing alarm about icing conditions. They discussed the pilots' lack of experience and poor judgment.  A corporate pilot, Dan, called in to offer a professional perspective on the handling of the autopilot and de-icing systems, flight hours, and challenges of flying in icy conditions.  Eddie Money was in studio, promoting his stand-up comedy CD with a promotional piece described as containing "stale dog shit one-liners,"  with the hosts discussing its tone and profanity.

Ron Howard then appeared as a guest.  The conversation covered his career, *Happy Days*, "jumping the shark,"  *Apollo 13*, *Angels & Demons*,  working with Tom Hanks,  his father Clint Howard's appearance in *Angels & Demons*, and his uncredited narration work on *Arrested Development*.  Following Howard's departure, Andrew Dice Clay joined the show. The conversation ranged from Dice Clay's acting experiences to a humorous Starbucks anecdote involving Opie and Anthony's recognition.  They discussed Christian Bale's on-set meltdown and the intense emotional environment on film sets.  Dice Clay offered his opinions on various films and actors, particularly Tom Hanks, using crude and sexually explicit language.  A significant portion focused on Dice Clay's sons' band, L.A. Rocks,  with the playing of their songs "Junkyard" and "Blitz."  The discussion included the sons' ages, musical influences, and surprising talent.

A later segment further highlighted L.A. Rocks,  Dice Clay's excitement about their prospects, and a contrast to his own current work.  He described their live performances, praising his sons' musical skills and comparing them to legendary musicians.  The conversation included their musical influences (Led Zeppelin, Elvis, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, White Stripes), songwriting process, and their aversion to drugs.  Confusion arose over their MySpace page, with a Caroline's Comedy Club employee (Greg) calling in to clarify Dice Clay's upcoming appearances.  The conversation included discussions of Dice Clay's career, upcoming shows (Caroline's Comedy Club and Tarrytown Music Hall), and his relationship with his sons, with tangents about a past demo that turned out to be Godsmack's.  This segment was heavily punctuated by vulgar and offensive language and jokes about sex.  A performance of L.A. Rocks' song "Rotten Core" was followed by extended discussions about sex, attempts to play Elvis Presley songs hampered by technical difficulties, and a brief Elvis impersonation by Dice Clay.

The show concluded with a lengthy, rambling discussion centered around musical performances and anecdotes, involving the hosts and Kenny.  This included Elvis Presley and Sammy Davis Jr. impersonations, an improvised sing-along, stories about past performances during Desert Storm, a Passover Seder sing-along, and elaborate tales of shoplifting from various stores (Macy's, Sam Ash, electronics stores),  often with comedic exaggerations and vulgar language.  The conversation frequently veered off into tangents, including discussions about upcoming shows and scheduling conflicts.  The overall tone was highly informal, punctuated by frequent interruptions, laughter, and profanity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, let's get the show on the road!  Good morning, welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Palaverous.  Is it palaverous?  Yeah, enough of the palaver, and then we start, so it means we're running completely palaverous.  Signs palaver?  With a complete lack of palaver of any way, shape, or form.  Shape form. Form.  Ah.  We're back in the womb.  Let's start calling our studio the womb.  Why, because it's small and freezing? 
[00:00:30]  Whose womb?  We're triplets in a womb.  Yeah.  Because every time we go out, down the tubes.  Yes, down the vagina.  And get spit out of the twat lips.  All hell breaks loose.  It's safer here.  Yeah.  I just found out on the way to work, even though this isn't work.  Positive?  You tell me?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's how you guys do it. 
[00:01:00]  Ron Howard's coming in.  Yes.  I found out from a text from Steve that woke me up.  Oh, that's good.  During my fucking final few minutes of sleep that you're like, ah, this is, you know, I'm  still in bed and I have this much time.  I'm like, man, Ron Howard.  Yeah, great.  Thanks.  I would, I would, I don't know.  I would like to defend you on that, but in this day and age, you got to turn that cell  phone off at night.  I did.  There's too much going on with the cell phone. 
[00:01:30]  The vibrate was on and I was in that, that state, that in between.  Right.  And it went, mark on my dresser.  Mark.  Go quiet mode, my, my brother.  Nah, I need, I need, uh, someone's dead, uh, uh, information.  You need someone's dead info.  You dummies that keep your phones on just in case someone dies in the middle of the night.  You're just not smart.  They're going to, they'll be waiting for you when you wake up in the morning.  And trust me, I've been not going to come back to life.  Don't worry.  I've been through three or four in the last five or six years. 
[00:02:00]  And guess what?  It's a horror show.  So the best thing you can do is get a good night's sleep, sleep, sleep through it.  Yeah.  Yes.  Before you go into a deep depression for, for two weeks, trust me, you won't be sleeping.  So the best thing you can do is turn off all your phones.  You'll wake up with a nice night's sleep and then you get the bad news.  Then the bad news comes and you're well rested.  You're well rested and ready to, to deal with it.  Oh God.  I'm not even joking. 
[00:02:30]  It's the way to go.  I don't know, man.  I'm one of those.  I got to at least have some line of communication open.  But what could you possibly do?  Nothing.  You're right.  You really got to break it down, break it down and ask yourself, what could I do if  the person is, is dead anyway?  Yeah, you're right.  The only thing is.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  The only thing is what?  There's some horrific accident and they need you to, you know, to save this person?  Well, that, that, you know, something like that.  Do you got some kind of rare blood type?  Maybe, you know.  Do you have the serum and you're safe at home? 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  My serum.  What the fuck, man?  The antidote.  I hold the antidote.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm one of those guys that need kind of to be connected and shit.  So, yeah, I, uh, no, I, I, I go quiet mode.  But, you know, I don't sleep the night ever.  I never get eight straight hours.  So if I, if I wake up in the middle of the night, I do a little rollover and I take a  quick look at the phone.  Like, okay, all, all's good.  And here's what I got to do.  I'll, I'll, I'll show you a prime example of how fucking, like, much I, I really, much 
[00:03:30]  help I need getting up.  Here's my alarm.  I have it set for 4.30 a.m., 4.35, 4.40, 4.50.  Good God.  Those are the times I have it set.  Then I have my clock radio alarm also set for 4.50 as like kind of an emergency backup  if the iPhone alarm doesn't work.  The iPhone plugs in to my clock radio on my, uh, night table.  So, but I set five alarms on my, uh, iPhone. 
[00:04:00]  Are you knocking them out every time?  Uh, yeah.  How many go through before you go?  I go through all five.  I wait and then I wake up at, uh, you know, I'm up.  So I wake up, uh, 4.40 like that.  And then sometimes if I'm just like, oh my God, I need 10 more.  I'll wait for the 4.50 one.  But, um, yeah.  Yeah.  You're, yeah.  God bless you.  I have the Bose, the one you have up, that concert volume.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's all done.  Concert volume.  It is. 
[00:04:30]  It's all done through a remote.  Yep.  Yeah.  So if your remote batteries are running out, which apparently mine are, it's getting  louder and louder and louder and louder and I'm hitting the remote button and nothing's  happening.  It won't turn off.  I almost had to put it in the tub.  With you in it, I hope.  Oh man.  The neighbors must love that.  Oh boy.  I hope they're going to see.  Oh, this Bose.  This Bose is ridiculous.  It's like when you're in a hotel room and next door to you at four in the morning and 
[00:05:00]  the room is vacant and someone set the fucking alarm and left it on and you're like, how  about you got a call downstairs?  Screw that.  How about you're in a hotel room?  Nice.  You want to sleep in.  You're on vacation or you got a day off and you forget to check the alarm clock in your  room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you'll find out that the day before some fucking continental airline pilot was in  there.  Got to be to the airport at 3 a.m.  Right.  Oh shit. 
[00:05:30]  All of a sudden it goes off at like some ungodly hour.  Yeah.  And then you can't get back to sleep.  Uh, Jersey Matt Bayonne.  Thank God.  I hope he's not the president because we'd be in deep shit if we're attacked at night.  Yeah, exactly.  If I stole Obama.  He takes the hotline off the hook.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck this.  What could possibly happen?  It's my logic.  You know, what are you going to do?  Well, I need my sleep.  Yeah.  No matter what.  Sleep is very, very important.  I got to give you a give it to you there.  Yeah.  But that's pretty cool.  Ron Howard coming in. 
[00:06:00]  Absolutely.  Later on.  And I guess, uh, intern David, he's only got three days left with us.  Three days left.  He has just been, you know, an intern.  Uh, of course, yes, he's been on the air and, and gave us so many chuckles.  But as far as taking claim to this, what did he say?  He said that he's, uh, taking credit for getting the Ron Howard booking done.  For real.  Now, how?  Get Sam, because Sam started this.  I don't know.  I, I, before we get into that, David came in and he's got three days left. 
[00:06:30]  So I was trying to give him a little, a little advice, considering I've been doing this radio  thing since I was 18.  Well, son.  Just a few little things.  Nothing.  Let me tell you, my boy.  You were giving him the old pat on the back.  Yeah, I wasn't trying to be like, you know, old douche trying to say, you know, this is  Oh, you remind me a lot of me when I was a Jew.  Just a few little dumb pointers.  That's it.  Nothing special.  Yeah.  And I'm talking to him and then he finally left the studio and I look at Ann and I go, 
[00:07:00]  I think I had better conversations with my six-year-old niece.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  I was like, I was, I was like, what am I talking to?  I gave him a pat on the back, leaving the other day just for the fuck of it.  And he winced.  He winced in a way like I had fucking stabbed him.  He's fantastic.  I love just touching him.  It's great.  We have to get a video of his winced.  Oh, I think we do have some.  But how did he claim to have any involvement in the Ron Howard booking? 
[00:07:30]  You're his handler.  So what's going on?  He couldn't get that done if his name was David Howard.  He co-booked him.  You co-booked?  There's something called co-booking?  Yeah, well, I mean, Ron Howard's kind of a big celebrity.  Well, I think his name is attached to a few popular projects over the years.  Sure.  So, I mean, sometimes it takes a tandem to get that booking.  Oh, a tag team.  Was it a good cop, bad cop?  I guess so.  Yeah, get on, do the fucking show. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, you know, don't pay attention to him.  We'd really like you to do the show.  So, what do you need two people for a booking?  Well, you know, Liam is our booker.  Yes.  Does a great job.  Does a fine job in getting us very good, entertaining guests.  But I guess he couldn't get the job done by himself.  But let it be known, we still miss the Roland.  Yes.  Right, of course.  The Holy Poli Roland.  Who doesn't miss Roland?  Sometimes Liam needs...  Dog is still dead Roland.  Jesus Christ.  Classic line that was. 
[00:08:30]  Woof, woof.  Fuck you.  That guy was classically brutal.  How's your dog?  We might have to play that.  Oh, it's so good.  Roland knew how to fight.  Oh, did he fight dirty?  God, he was a timid little thing.  Large thing.  You'd hear him laugh when you'd tickle him.  Dee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  And he's just like, okay, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  And then he gets in a fight and he's just like, fuck your mother. 
[00:09:00]  Fuck her, fuck her in the air.  Unbelievable.  Wow, he's brutal.  Yeah, he's bad.  So, yes, I'd like to know how this tandem tag team booking...  Because you need somebody from the show to make sure that the booker is on his game.  You know what I mean?  All right.  And usually, I mean, David said that usually it would be the executive producer,  but sometimes somebody needs to come and fill in for the executive producer when he's not getting the job done.  So, why wouldn't somebody else fill in for the executive producer, maybe a paid employee, somebody that... 
[00:09:30]  Maybe yourself, Sam.  I was going to say, yeah, meaning you, Sam.  Sam, maybe yourself.  It's the thing.  He picked up the ball and ran with it, didn't he?  That's what happens.  I mean, I dropped the ball and David picked it up.  Thank God.  I want to start by asking David, sometimes Steve drops the ball?  Yes, that's true.  He does sometimes, yes.  In what way?  You got an example?  He just doesn't do a good job booking things.  Even today, he dropped the ball.  I heard there's a big mix-up today. 
[00:10:00]  What?  All right.  Yeah, yeah, there is a bit of a mix-up.  I heard a little panic.  There's a big mix-up today.  What is it?  Yeah.  What's the mix-up?  Apparently, Steve C. booked Andrew Dice Clay for the show today, but he's booked at the  exact same time that Ron Howard is booked for today.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  No.  Why did he do that?  I don't get it.  Why did he do that?  Together?  Yeah, so that's not...  That's...  Commotion, yes.  Promotion? 
[00:10:30]  Yes.  What's that have to do with...  Commotion.  But it's a promotion.  No, commotion.  Commotion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what should we do about that?  Because Steve hasn't really come up with a solution yet.  No, no.  No, he hasn't.  No, he hasn't.  What should we do, David?  I think we should make Mr. Andrew Dice Clay wait.  Wow, I can't wait to tell Dice that intern David, a fellow Jew, told you to wait.  You're your idol, Opie.  You're named after him.  You've got to have him when he comes. 
[00:11:00]  Let's relax.  You've got to have him.  He's not my idol.  Yeah.  Oh.  I had some idols growing up, but not Ron Howard.  I just look like the guy.  And then, because of that asshole, I'm a middle-aged man with the name Opie, okay?  Let's be real about this.  When I was 12, it kind of sounded all right.  It's all cute.  Yeah, it's all cute and cuddly until you start growing pubic hairs and realize you're stuck  with this name for the rest of your life.  Dude, just be grateful.  Was it Gober or something else?  It could have been a lot worse than Opie.  Gober.  Well, they were thinking how it went down. 
[00:11:30]  I told you how it went down, right?  Oh, my God.  I think I was in seventh grade.  And this girl, Julie Burson, I give her credit every single time.  She pointed me out as we're waiting for the teacher.  She goes, hey, you.  What's your nickname?  I go, I don't have a nickname.  She made me stand in front of the class and then have everyone try to figure out my nickname  on the spot.  And everything from Howdy Doody to Will Robinson from Lost in Space to Four Eyes because I  was wearing glasses.  Four Eyes is so fucking packed.  Those are the ones I remember and there were brutal, even more brutal ones in there. 
[00:12:00]  And then she finally just looked at me and goes, Opie.  Thank God.  Got a bit hot cocked.  Should have flown out of someone's mouth.  Thank God.  I still would have been knocking 10 because I never would have signed on to the Howdy Doody  in Anthony's show.  Or the Four Eyes in Anthony's show.  Four Eyes in Anthony's show.  You'd have to wear glasses even though he had to correct him for surgery.  But if, yeah.  Oh, it would become a gimmick to have to wear them with no glass in them.  But if they called me Howdy Doody, I would have been probably stuck with that name somehow. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  I probably would have been Howdy by this point.  Or you'd cool it up by just A-H-D.  Yeah.  It's A-H-D.  What does A-H-D stand for?  Howdy Doody.  Well, that's what the fans do.  Yeah.  When they say O-N-A.  Because I know, guys.  Trust me.  I know.  It's hard to say Opie and Anthony.  O-N-A.  Because the Opie part is pretty fucking total.  It's literally hard to say it.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  So I know the people that are trying to be a little cooler.  Go, yeah, O-N-A.  O-N-A.  I know what that's about.  We get it.  All right.  Anyways, back to you.  Not my idol there, David.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:13:00]  Now, how?  I respect the guy and I love a lot of the stuff he's done.  I want to know how.  Give me a fucking timeline like they're shown with that airplane crash and transcripts of  how you actually helped book this.  Okay.  Well, it was last Friday.  Wow.  It goes back that far.  Okay.  Yes.  It goes back to last Friday.  Yes.  And Opie was discussing on this very show about Mr. Ron Howard. 
[00:13:30]  I remember that.  It's almost like I was sitting here.  Yes.  Yes.  How about that?  Yeah.  He was discussing how he saw him at a Starbucks.  Uh-huh.  Right.  And I know the story, David.  Yes.  So he said that he wanted Ron Howard on the show.  Right.  So I said, well, if he wants Ron Howard on the show, we better get him on the show.  See?  This is what you get with intern David.  There's no Steve C. saying, well, if he wants it, he's got it. 
[00:14:00]  That's intern David.  David thought, hey, I just heard Opie request something.  I don't care how hard it is.  We go.  Yes.  We go.  If Opie wants Ron Howard, then we got to get Ron Howard here.  Yes.  That's it.  Wow.  You snapped into action.  Yes, I did.  And now there's a big step between hearing someone say they want a guest.  Yes.  And getting the guest.  Let me tell you something.  Correct.  I'd love to have Christian Bale. 
[00:14:30]  Oh.  In studio.  Okay.  In studio.  We're going to get him.  I'm going to make it.  Yeah.  I want to dominate a movie.  I mean, the new Terminator movie coming out, Christian Bale.  He's been in a lot of my favorite movies.  Okay.  And I would like to have that.  But you now saying, we got to get him.  I got to get him.  Now, is that where your job ends?  No.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  So now we'll go with the Ron Howard thing. 
[00:15:00]  Okay.  You said, Opie wants Ron Howard.  We're getting Ron Howard.  How did you then go from that step of knowing that we want him to actually him coming on  the show and your involvement in that?  Okay.  Well, I thought to myself, how do I go about booking Ron Howard?  I'm not a talent booker.  No.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  So I said, well, if I'm not a talent booker, then I should approach the person who is the  talent booker for the show.  What you put two and two together and you got four, my friend. 
[00:15:30]  Yes.  You knew.  Go to the booker to book a guest.  Yes.  To request for the booker.  Ask him if he can book the guest for us.  Could you tell us what you do here?  You go between the talent and the booker.  Is that what I'm a little bit?  Why can't the talent go right to the booker?  Because we're trying to get the fuck out of here.  I'm a people person.  Well, first of all, he's setting up an office space. 
[00:16:00]  Of course.  God damn it.  You got to see that movie.  You got to see that movie.  What exactly do you would, what exactly would you say you do here?  All right.  So you went to the booker.  Well, I went upstairs.  This is the 36th floor.  So I had to go to the 37th floor.  We had an elevator trip.  No, I didn't go to the elevator.  I walked up the stairs.  Holy shit.  A lot of people, certain producers around here.  Yes. 
[00:16:30]  They'll wait until the booker comes downstairs.  Right.  David is a man of action.  He goes upstairs.  Upstairs.  To the booker.  You went to the booker's office?  Well, I searched around the office, the upstairs.  I didn't know which one.  There's many offices up there.  I didn't know which one his office was.  Please tell me you walked into Mel's office.  Are you the booker?  Who are you?  Are you the booker?  Please tell me.  Please tell me you did that.  No, I just walked around aimlessly and didn't see Liam anywhere.  And I went up to a random person that was sitting at a desk and said, do you know where 
[00:17:00]  Liam Davenport's office is?  He grabbed Mel's tie.  Hey.  Yeah, and did they know?  They knew where his office was, yes.  But refused to tell you because you were a creep.  No, they told me.  They told me.  Yeah.  And I walked around some more and I still couldn't find the office.  And then I asked another person, you know where Liam Davenport's office is?  And they pointed.  And I looked in the office and he was not in the office.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Look, now a lot of people at that point would have gone, look, 
[00:17:30]  I've gone above and beyond here.  Ron Howard won't be on the show.  I've walked up the stairs.  I've asked two people for where the booker's office is.  Because I wasn't paying attention the first time.  You know, I'm just going to go downstairs and call this one a wash.  Yeah.  But no.  No.  David, he kept going.  You are, you're an amazing man, David.  So I went back to the second person who told me where Liam Davenport's office is. 
[00:18:00]  And by this point, did they go, oh, fuck, here he comes again.  He did make a little, a little sound like that.  Something like that.  I think he did.  Why is he telling the story in real time?  Oh, I know, I know.  I am the voice of the listener today.  This is ridiculous, by the way, David.  Holy shit.  So you go up to the guy again.  Yes, correct.  And what happens?  I said to the guy.  It's a three-part joke.  I said to the guy, I'm looking for Liam Davenport. 
[00:18:30]  He's not in his office.  If you see him, could you tell him that intern David from the Opie and Anthony show is looking  for him?  Whoa.  You gave your title and everything.  Yes.  Intern David.  I feel that was impressive to the person.  And they really took note of what you had to say.  Right.  And then what?  Then what happened?  And then he said, okay.  Oh, my God.  And I left.  Then he said, okay.  And he left.  So he walked back down the stairs.  Yeah, you got it.  Jesus Christ.  So now, get to the point, the thrilling point of the meeting between you and Liam.  Like a half hour, 45 minutes later, I'm down here being an intern, and then Liam comes 
[00:19:00]  down here and approaches me.  No way.  And says, I heard you've been looking for me.  Wow.  Yes.  He did.  David just says, I heard you've been looking for me.  And then he looked around the room for this approval from everybody, for this accolades  that he's never going to receive.  So you started talking to him.  What was that discussion like?  Well, I explained to him the situation.  And you confirmed that you had been looking for him.  Yes, I confirmed. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  I certainly did.  You're right.  You're right, Jimmy.  So you said, you relayed to him Opie's request to have Ron Howard on the program.  Well, it was more than that.  And he said, oh, I know.  No, it was more than that.  I retold Liam.  I told Liam the story that Opie said on the show.  About how he met him at the Starbucks.  And coming from you, it must have been captivating.  Right.  Yeah.  I hope you had a two-hour lunch.  And then what did he say to you? 
[00:20:00]  He said.  After you woke him up.  After you woke him up, he said.  By the way, people are saying, especially Mike and Boston, the whole story could have  been told in two sentences.  Oh, absolutely.  Went upstairs, said, Liam, I need to talk to you.  Downstairs, 45 minutes later, Liam came and saw me.  The whole upstairs was so unnecessary.  It's almost like, what happened?  Well, I connected with Liam and I just told him that you needed to walk around.  No, you had to walk around, talk to people three times to find where he was, leave the  message. 
[00:20:30]  It's everything.  It's amazing.  So, amazing story.  I'm surprised the accounting department didn't just grab you.  Oh, I know, right?  And take you hostage.  Yeah, you belong up here.  So, now, where did it come in that the actual booking happened and you were part of it?  The actual booking?  Yeah.  It happened later on in the day, like after this show was over already.  Mm-hmm.  It was pretty much that.  And how were you involved in that? 
[00:21:00]  Were you in on the conference call?  Did you talk to Ron Howard?  You talked to Ron's people.  No, I didn't even talk to Ron's people.  I think that was Liam who talked to Ron's people.  Really?  He had Liam do it.  Oh, he had Liam do it.  Yeah, you delegated responsibility.  That's good.  So, how is he responsible for the Ron Howard booking?  Thank you.  The co-booking of Ron Howard.  Because I asked Liam if he would try to book, if he could try to book Ron Howard for our  show.  Now, let me ask you something.  Hasn't it been a blanket thing here over the past, I don't know, year at least that we 
[00:21:30]  want Ron Howard on this show?  Oh, yeah.  And hasn't the booker known that we want Ron Howard on the show?  Weren't we talking about the fact that Ron Howard's got a new movie coming out and we  would like to have him on the show?  I just realized I've got to give myself a little credit.  Because when I bumped into him on Columbus Avenue on that rainy morning, I said, hey.  What time was it, Opie?  It was very early.  It was probably like...  How many steps away were you?  I said, Ron, I would love to have you on our radio show one day. 
[00:22:00]  And look, it's happening today.  See?  David had nothing to do with it, really.  So now there's three of us that were involved with this book.  Wow, this is a massive undertaking.  You didn't talk to any of the people.  You talked to Liam, who really knew that we wanted Ron Howard.  But watch, David is kind of Liam's apprentice, almost. 
[00:22:30]  Like, he's learning to book talent.  Wasn't Ron Howard tentatively booked?  That's true.  He was tentatively booked, yes.  Well, why wouldn't you tell the talent?  Why wouldn't I tell the talent?  That he was tentatively booked?  Yeah.  Because I was told not to tell the talent because tentatively means that he may be.  It's not official yet.  So I was told not to tell anyone until it was official.  Now, how would you know that if you weren't a talent booker?  Wait, how is he going to turn knowing more than we are?  There's a possibility that Ron Howard's going to be on our show.  Because I didn't find out until Steve woke me up this morning with an obnoxious text. 
[00:23:00]  Why would he do that, by the way?  I don't know.  Wouldn't that info...  He's excited.  Like, at some point...  At 4.30, you're going to be here a little after 5 anyway.  I'll find out when I get here.  There's no need to wake me.  Ron Howard, whoa!  He also texts Kenny, too.  What?  Yeah.  Well, because, you know, Kenny's going to have a few questions, I guess, for Ron Howard.  Go ahead, David.  So, that's it?  That's pretty much it.  So, I just knew about him more because I was conferring with Liam every step of the way 
[00:23:30]  to see how his progress was going.  I guess what we need to ask you is, what did you do that Steve did not do for the Ron Howard booking?  I approached...  As I said, I approached Liam and asked him if he'd be able to book Ron Howard for the show.  Steve did not approach Liam and ask him if he could book him.  Did Steve know that he wanted to be booked on the show?  I don't think Steve had a clue, no.  Probably not, no.  But doesn't Steve listen to the show, David? 
[00:24:00]  You would think so, wouldn't you?  I hope he does.  You are fucking a gem.  Yeah.  All right.  You like David.  I love David.  Yeah, he's all right in my book, though.  All right, David.  Well, we continue with Intern David because Sam did a backstage with O&A with Jason Ellis.  You know who Jason Ellis is, right?  Yes.  Intern David.  Yes, I remember him.  Does a show on Faction every afternoon.  And his best of, or not necessarily the best of, is played on this channel on the weekends. 
[00:24:30]  Now, after he did an appearance on our show, he gave you a little advice on men?  Yes, he did.  On being a man?  On being a man.  Oh, well.  That's a little different.  Well, he did say yes, he did.  On being a man.  Being a man, yes.  Okay.  And this is how it went down.  We might have to stop this a few times.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  Oh, I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and Opie and Anthony Intern David has been moping around 
[00:25:00]  the SiriusXM facility as of late, as his internship is about to end, and there is nothing good going  on in his life.  Luckily, we found expert on all things manly, Jason Ellis, in the hall, and got him to give  David some life-improving tips.  This is our intern, David.  Now, our intern, David, is very fond of, what's some of your favorite musical artists?  I'm a big fan of musical artists like Beyonce, I like, and I like Britney Spears, and I like 
[00:25:30]  all the top 40 artists.  Now, David is 26.  Yeah.  He lives at home and spends most of his time masturbating in his parents' house while  listening to music like this.  What could you say as far as maybe character-building advice for David?  I think that it goes both ways.  Like, I can tell what you guys are doing right now, and I think that, you know, a man who's  into Britney Spears and Beyonce, at the end of the day, Beyonce is an excellent singer.  She does have sideburns, but she does have an excellent voice.  I think that there's some men out there that go to battle and they fight for the country, 
[00:26:00]  and then there's other people that build robots so that they can fight for the country  as well.  It's people like me and him that unite and make this world a great place.  David, do you think you can build some robots?  There's no problem with me starting right now.  Well, it started nice enough, but after standing in front of intern David for over 60 seconds,  his appearance alone was enough to completely frustrate and disgust Jason Ellis.  Why don't you thank Mr. Ellis for helping your life?  Thank you, Mr. Ellis.  I appreciate it.  Are you frowning at me right now?  No, I'm not frowning at you. 
[00:26:30]  No way.  Why are you looking down at my shoes now?  Are you disrespecting me by looking at my feet?  Oh, no.  No, I'm certainly not.  I'm looking right at you.  Keep looking at me.  Keep watching.  Why do you brush your hair off to the side like that?  I don't know.  I've just been doing that.  Go.  Look at me.  All I ever wanted was my hair back.  You go, just frizz it up, man.  That's a thing for a tip for girls.  This whole side part thing means you don't take chances.  You're in a box, man.  Bust out.  You're like in a Rubik's Cube.  Your shirt's cool. 
[00:27:00]  Get some new kicks, man.  Those things are fried.  You look like you're going hiking on a picnic or something.  I'm just trying to help, man.  I got you.  I got you.  I appreciate the help.  Good luck, David.  Thank you, Jason.  Thank you.  Like most, Jason left the meeting with no faith that intern David will ever accomplish  anything of substance.  Good luck with that, David.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  David, you didn't take his advice.  You still got the side poof.  Yeah, the side poof.  You got the bad clothes. 
[00:27:30]  Your part is way down on the side.  You have too much hair to be parting your hair like that.  Yeah, it's like a comb-over part.  It starts at the top of your ear.  We should have him spike his hair today.  You got some gel?  You should get all wild.  Let's get some gel and spike his hair up.  Yeah.  Maybe give him a, what is it called, a manhawk or something?  Is Jill here today?  No.  Oh, see, we need a girl's kind of, uh...  What's Steve doing?  Oh, yes. 
[00:28:00]  I always wanted to do this.  Who's got hair product today?  I bet Iraq's got a little jealous.  Oh, I'm sure Iraq does.  Of course he does.  You want to frost it first?  I have some of that in my bag.  I don't think Iraq does the frosting anymore.  No, he was, though.  Who was he ever?  Oh, we beat him up about that one.  Oh, he knows never to do that again.  The only frosting now is what he eats on cake.  He should frost his hair with a lawnmower blade. 
[00:28:30]  Put white paint on it.  We got one more quickie as far as intern David goes.  He says he likes the pop music.  Well, he sang a little Lady Gaga for everybody today.  You're not a fan of the Lady Gaga?  Lady Gaga?  Nah.  Or him singing.  Can't read my, can't read my  No, he can't read my poker face  She's got me like nobody  Can't read my, can't read my  No, he can't read my poker face 
[00:29:00]  She's got me like nobody  P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face  P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face  I won't tell you that I love you  Kiss or hug you  Cause I'm bluffing with my muffin  I'm not lying  I'm just stunning  With my love glue gunning  Just like a chick in the casino  Take your bank before I pay you out  I promise this, promise this  Check this hand cause I'm marvelous  He can't read my, can't read my, can't read my 
[00:29:30]  No, he can't read my poker face  She's got me like nobody  Can't read my, can't read my  No, he can't read my poker face  She's got me like nobody  We're like producing these too well, I think  Yeah, these are really good to produce now  That was good  We know Dave  I didn't hear the produce part  Wow  He sounded like  Wow, I'm good  He sounded like that old song  Putting on the Ritz 
[00:30:00]  Anybody?  Oh  Who did that?  Taco?  Yeah, I think it was Taco.  Very good.  Putting on the Ritz.  Putting on the Ritz.  Very good appearance this morning.  Thank you.  Yeah, good for one of your last appearances.  I guess you sort of co-booked Ron Howard.  Sort of.  What do you suggest with the Dice thing?  You suggest he should wait.  Dice should wait, yes.  Until Ron Howard is done.  Correct.  We'll make sure we tell Dice that in a little tidbit.  Yeah.  Okay.  But, I mean, just so everybody has the correct idea, David was outside the studio, not so 
[00:30:30]  much taking pride in the booking itself, but just taking pride in the fact that he thinks  he's outshined Steve C.  Well.  Which, I mean...  It's not hard to do.  And I think he's taking something I told him very seriously.  What's that, Sam?  Well, you, I think on Friday, offhandedly, when you said this, when you said the Ron Howard  thing, David approached you while you were going to the bathroom and said, I'm going 
[00:31:00]  to get Ron Howard on the show.  I'm going to go talk to Liam.  And you, just trying to get back into the studio, brushed him off by saying, hey, you're  doing better than Steve already.  Oh.  Oh.  So he took that to heart.  Oh, yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  And David, how have you been doing?  Very well.  Better than?  Better than Steve C.  Oh, wow.  You should have a t-shirt made.  Better than Steve C.  I'd have to print out a lot of them.  We need to buy those in bulk. 
[00:31:30]  Shut up.  Okay, buy them.  Well, we'll have shirts.  Thank you.  Good one.  Thank you.  Yes.  My improv skills are wonderful.  We should buy them in bulk.  Yes, you should.  Thank you.  Oh, fuck.  Cicotic from Wagbag writes, make David wear shit like Rob Halford. 
[00:32:00]  Ooh.  And then he gives a website where he can see all the fun stuff that Rob Halford's been  wearing lately.  Yeah, we got to spike his hair up.  Yeah, let's do that.  Okay.  Can we rip your shirt and shit?  And put some holes in your jeans?  What?  Yeah, look at the look.  He makes this look like, oh my God, I got to do it for this show, but I don't want to  do this at all.  And I, because every, all kinds of things going through that head, big poofy haired head.  Are you wearing that thing? 
[00:32:30]  I saw an infomercial for the bump.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's some plastic thing that chicks brush their hair forward and they put it like on  the skull, on the skull cap, like of their head, the crown.  Okay.  And then they brush the hair over it and it gives that old 60s style kind of bump.  It's called the bump.  You look like you're wearing the bump on your head.  What have you got under there?  The bump.  He looked all week for a Patsy Weber wig. 
[00:33:00]  He's making his old jealous with all that hair of his.  Jesus.  What the fuck, dude?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  That shit will fall out eventually.  Harvest everybody.  Jewish guys, usually when they're younger, do have a lot of hair.  Oh, my God.  Like that.  And then once you get a little older, it gets to be that horseshoe hair thing.  Do you think he has a nice harvest area?  Yeah, he'll have a good harvest area.  Yeah, and he could cover it up with a yarmulke. 
[00:33:30]  So you won't even have to worry about it.  That's a good idea.  How often do you wear the yarmulke?  Do you wear it a lot?  No, not too often.  No?  Because some people wear it all the time.  I never understood, like, the bobby pins in there going to school and everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The bobby pins, they just put it there in their hair to make sure that the yarmulke doesn't  fall off their head.  Really?  I thought it had religious significance.  The bobby pins?  No.  He clears me up on that one.  Thank you, David. 
[00:34:00]  I don't know how you're supposed to pick up chicks wearing a yarmulke.  A yarmulke.  Well, Jewish girls, you get.  Yeah, but I always felt bad for the guys.  I'm like, man, it's tough out there to begin with.  And now you're going to these bars with a yarmulke on with bobby pins.  And they know you have money, though.  If they think you're a Jewish guy, they probably get a good job.  That's true.  It's a dumb observation, obviously.  But I always thought that, like, you know, it made it a little harder for some of the  guys out there.  Do you ever go to one of those Jewish singles weekends?  You ever hear about those?  I heard of them, yeah.  Yeah.  You never went?  No.  You ever think you're gonna? 
[00:34:30]  You meet a nice Jewish girl.  Maybe.  Your family will like her and stuff.  You can't be bringing home a shiksa, right?  No.  No.  What's that, Ed?  That's a regular old non-Jew girl.  A regular broad?  Regular, yeah, non-Jew broad.  This day and age.  You look down upon us because we're not Jews.  The family does, right?  They want you with a Jewish girl.  Of course they do, yes.  Yeah.  Nice Jewish girl.  You're not gonna marry a Jew, though, right?  Nice girl.  Probably will, yes.  Settle down.  Why don't you settle down?  Why are you gonna marry a Jew? 
[00:35:00]  Because you have to?  Yeah.  Or you want to?  No, he has to.  He's cut down his choices.  No, I have to.  Oh, boy.  What if there is the hottest girl and she falls head over heels in love with you and she  is a horrid, horrid Catholic?  Uh-oh.  Because, you know.  That's no good.  That'd be a big problem.  Would you turn Catholic?  I know a lot of people turn Jewish to get into relationships.  They do.  But convert.  Would you convert to Catholicism over a girl? 
[00:35:30]  I don't know.  That'd be a tough one.  I don't know.  I'd have to really think hard about it.  Would your family disown you?  Maybe.  They wouldn't like that one bit.  Yeah.  No.  You do know it is the real religion, though, right?  No.  No.  No.  Don't make us waterboard you until you say yes.  Oh, David.  All right, David.  You are a card.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He agrees.  Yes, I'm a card.  Yeah.  All right, David.  Thank you.  I'll go look for some gel. 
[00:36:00]  You know what?  Yeah.  Look for some gel.  I will.  And Christian Bale.  And Christian Bale.  And Christian Bale.  That, too.  Yes.  Christian Bale.  Terminator Salvation comes out.  I want Christian Bale sitting at the console right next to our good friend, Jimmy Norton.  I'll get right on that.  Thank you.  Hey, David and Bobo.  You're doing a David and Bobo show on Friday, your last day?  Oh.  If he comes in, yes.  If he comes in, of course he will.  And Bobo on his Twitter last night.  Do we have his Twitter?  I don't follow Bobo on my Twitter.  Go figure.  I think it's Mr. Met. 
[00:36:30]  It's Mr. Met 8.  M-R-M-E-T, number 8.  Mr. Met 8.  Of course.  He's already advertising for a new David on his Twitter.  Really?  Can you find that one, Danny?  Or is it?  Oh, right there at the top.  I'm sorry.  The search for the new David is on.  Bobo needs the new sidekick ASAP.  Uh-oh.  I need a new sidekick.  What kind of stuff does he Twitter?  Give me a little sample of some of the stuff there, Danny. 
[00:37:00]  The next Twitter says, yo, he's talking directly to Opie.  Yo, Opie, how about having me and David eat sliders until one of us makes a I-can't-hold-it fart?  What is that?  Now he's giving show ideas on Twitter.  Oh, fantastic.  No, show ideas for him and David.  Yes.  Yeah, all right.  Iron Sheik really needs to wear.  That's W-H-E-R-E.  Depends. 
[00:37:30]  Wear.  Yeah.  Wear.  This is one of the best moments on the show of all time.  Lol.  Smiley face.  Holy shit.  Let's see.  Yeah, he's a pisser.  Oh, he's doing Jersey jokes.  The swine flu has hit my hometown of Queens hard.  Wendy, look out.  It also hit Jersey.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  And he smells, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, that's his signature little bit.  So, all right.  Good Bobo.  Good boy.  Good Bobo.  Well, hopefully he'll come in Friday and we'll hear what will be the last. 
[00:38:00]  Do you have any plans?  I mean, we've asked you this before, but any plans on what you're going to be doing after  you leave here?  I mean, this has been a big part of your life, I think.  It certainly has, yes.  Yeah.  What you're taking away from it, where you're going, what do you want to continue on this  road of broadcasting?  What are you doing, David?  We'll see.  I would like to continue and stay in the radio broadcasting field, definitely.  Yeah, so would we.  Wow.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  So, any plans?  We'll see.  Just press harder.  So, that means no.  No, not.  You have no immediate plans.  Not immediate.  Just keep looking for jobs anywhere I can in this field.  You're going to sleep in late for a little while, though?  Maybe on the first day.  His parents have threatened to throw him out of the house.  Oh, shit.  Very quickly, so.  Oh, shit.  So, you've got to be pounding that pavement, my friend.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  I hear you.  All right, David.  Same to not those resumes.  Yeah.  Yep.  Good deal.  Now you have this great addition to a resume.  That's true.  Oh, and a show. 
[00:39:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, congrats, David.  And we'll see you later.  He has a new skill to add to his resume, too.  What?  Talent booker.  Talent booker, of course.  It's so hard to get David out of the studio.  Anyone else notice?  I know it is.  There's no easy way to wrap up an interview.  You know why?  He doesn't leave.  It's really weird.  Like, he stands there and looks at you.  You actually have to tell him, leave.  I'm just annoyed now.  He's like fumes.  I went from loving having him in, and now I'm just annoyed that he's still standing there. 
[00:39:30]  You said, well, I was going to say, you said goodbye to me.  I'll be the Nancy.  So I knew you were going to do a last David and Bobo show and keep the conversation going.  We understand all that.  And then Ann was trying to wrap up, and then I jumped back in, because it's just this weird,  we don't know how to end the interview with you.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you stand there and make, like, that smile and that face and everything, and  it's so much material.  Like, you're not leaving.  You're still not leaving.  Because you're talking about me right to me, so.  Oh, Kenny just threw it out. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  Kenny fucking goon-armed him right out of here.  Not talking anymore there.  His phone's ripped off his head, and out he went.  Yep.  We're going to take a quick break.  Got to get into this Buffalo plane crash.  Oh, wow.  Did you read transcripts?  Yeah, I read.  Did you read the Daily News version?  That's what I'm reading right now.  Because the other version, they blew it, because the first line is unbelievable.  Is it in that one?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's Lots of Ice? 
[00:40:30]  No.  No, no, no.  Oh, you're looking at the Post.  No, no.  The Post one is the one that's got the good one.  The Post has the good one.  Oh, the Post has the good one?  On page five.  Open your workbooks to page five of the New York Post.  Can we do that to the break?  Yeah.  Because just reading the first line is going to get everybody going.  The first line in the transcript from the cockpit recorder is unbelievable.  You don't want your pilot saying some of this stuff.  Hell effing no over on satellite.  Hell fucking no.  You don't want your little fucking minxy 24-year-old co-pilot on the plane at all. 
[00:41:00]  And there was flirting going on that we were supposed to get into yesterday, but we were  too busy.  We'll get into that and other things.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Big day.  We got Ron Howard stopping in today.  Opie, are you going to go to L.A.?  I want to.  I'll give you my flight information.  All right.  I got a pen.  Go ahead.  Look at you, too.  I don't have it with me.  I'll kind of give it to you.  Oh, all right. 
[00:41:30]  Go fuck yourself.  Then all the fans will be at the plane waiting for us.  Yeah.  We invited you.  What, an open invite?  I want a real invitation.  If I had a private plane leaving from your driveway, which, by the way, is a possibility  with the size of it, you wouldn't come.  I would love you to come to L.A.  I know.  Oh, the motherfucker got me back.  Now we're going to L.A. for my birthday, right?  I didn't know you were coming out there for my birthday, Jimmy.  And we're actually doing that big benefit because of your birthday. 
[00:42:00]  Just get up your good gift.  Jay, Carolla, we're all chipping in to get up a good gift.  No, for real.  I want to go out there now next weekend.  For real.  For real, yo.  Let's go to the cockpit recordings of my Buffalo plane crash.  But we don't have the audio?  What's that about?  No, they haven't released that yet?  I don't release no audio here.  We've got transcripts.  It's all fun and games up until the grim part.  You're definitely an expert on this, even though you have no flying time.  But how you talk about flight, I feel you could actually... 
[00:42:30]  I do have a little flying time under my belt.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  With who?  Republic Airport for their...  What did they used to call it?  It was a certain program.  And you went and they took you up.  You took the control.  I've heard there's commercials.  It's like a little shakedown thing.  You did that?  Yeah, years ago.  Nice.  And yeah, the guy told me I was a natural.  I think he just wanted my money.  I don't know.  How do you talk about this stuff?  I think you know what you're doing.  I just love airplanes. 
[00:43:00]  You should fly.  It'd be a good hobby for you.  I just don't like the falling out of the sky part like these two people.  Get a Lee Abrams plane where he's got the parachute plane.  Oh, the parachute.  Yeah, he does have the parachute plane.  He's got the parachute plane and he said it's been used...  I forgot.  Remember he told that whole story on our show?  Yeah.  Like six or seven guys have used the parachute already?  And no problems.  It's got to be scary that it's going to deploy, though, in mid-flight.  Yeah, but at least you got that hope. 
[00:43:30]  You know how easy flying would be if you had a parachute where you go, okay, God forbid something horrible happens up here, we still have a shot?  Yeah.  That would take half the fear away.  I don't think it works very well if you're really plummeting.  I don't think so.  I think that's that you're landing, you're slowed down pretty well, something goes amiss.  Oh, great.  Thanks, Ed.  And you pull that thing.  I think if you're at cruising speed and at altitude and you pull that thing, it could be some problems.  The space shuttle has a parachute because it can't retake off.  And I don't know what kind of brakes it has. 
[00:44:00]  It just uses the dumb parachute.  Yeah, the dumb parachute, that archaic friggin' brake system.  That whole thing, when it comes in, it's doing, like, you know, 17,000 miles an hour, and it just has to circle to lose speed.  Yeah, to lose all that speed.  I don't think a regular plane parachute would hold up, though.  It would just rip them off.  Okay.  Yeah.  Maybe you'll pull it up into a stall and then pull the chute.  Now, yesterday's news, I guess you got a young co-pilot.  Is she officially a pilot?  Co-pilot?  What's her title?  She's the co-pilot.  She's the co-pilot.  She's flying right seat. 
[00:44:30]  The picture they're showing, it looks like she has braces on.  Dude, she's 24.  She's 24.  And this looks like a college graduation picture they got on the paper today.  Looks like she's wearing braces.  She's 24.  She's blonde.  She's kind of hot.  Yeah, sexy for a pilot.  A lot of times, you know, just because you're blonde, you know, you have to say hot.  But that's not the case all the time.  Well, she's, you know, she's all right.  She's all right, though.  Well, she's got youth on her side.  Yeah.  You know, youth makes things a lot better.  And then you've got 47-year-old Marvin Renslow, who is the pilot. 
[00:45:00]  And he is just, I don't know.  Look at Marvin.  I think Marvin wanted to get a little tail.  I think we understand why this plane crashed.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at Marvin and the desperation in his eyes.  And then he's matched up with his young co-pilot.  Yeah.  Fresh out of college.  I think that it was, and there's a lot of chit-chat going on here.  A lot of non-plane chit-chat going on. 
[00:45:30]  Didn't it come out yesterday they were flirting?  Or I'm assuming that Marvin was doing more of the flirting.  There's just this flirty kind of atmosphere going on and the stuff they're talking about.  And the thing is, as you read these transcripts, you realize they don't start talking about the icing  until 22, like, 22-13, 22-12, something like that.  I see 22-10. 
[00:46:00]  Or 22-10, well, whatever it is.  Right.  By 22-16, they're fucking dead.  So five, six minutes, that's it.  And they start talking about how much ice is on the plane.  But there's no conversation beforehand of, hey, I'm noticing some ice on the plane.  Like, get it at a level where it's manageable.  And you can start thinking about how you're going to get rid of this ice or divert or just  something where you're not all of a sudden looking out the window going, that's the most 
[00:46:30]  ice I've ever seen.  Perhaps if you weren't yapping with your fucking 24-year-old co-pilot, you'd have done something.  Wow.  And also, these planes, I was just going to say, because Danny popped a picture up, the  two years, the first two years out of college were not kind for her.  A little drop-off.  Looks like she was eating a little chubby in the face.  She's cute there.  She doesn't look like any college girl.  She doesn't look like a pilot.  No, no.  Apparently, she didn't fly like one either.  Tell you the truth. 
[00:47:00]  Go ahead, Dan.  I'm sorry.  She was kind of scared of the ice.  And you read these transcripts, you know, there's parts of it where she's saying she didn't  want to fly on ice, she's afraid they would crash.  She said that like minutes before she crashed.  And yeah, the plane, like the pilot wasn't experienced on this plane, and it has a feature  where if you're starting a stall, which is a wing stall, not an engine stall, means you're  not going fast enough.  And with more ice on the wings, the faster you have to go to keep that thing in the air.  And they're approaching a landing, so they're cutting back on the speed, and this thing 
[00:47:30]  starts to wing over on him, and he loses control.  What the plane automatically does is it pitches nose down, which sounds scary, but it's to  build the speed back up.  The plane knows, look, I got to fucking pitch my nose down and fly down to pick up some speed  and then level off.  And it knows what the altitude is, so it knows it can't do it at 800 feet or something.  And they weren't at 800 feet, they were apparently at the proper altitude where this plane could 
[00:48:00]  do that.  And the pilot was fighting that.  The nose went down, he's pulling back on the yoke, trying to get the nose of the plane  back up, and this is causing that rocking back and forth, back and forth, up and down.  So he didn't realize that the plane was doing what it's supposed to do at that point?  Yeah, the plane was doing what it was supposed to do when it's going to stall, which is pitch  the nose down.  That's rookie shit.  Yeah, and then it just started rolling, because as you're pulling the nose up, the plane's 
[00:48:30]  slowing down even more.  So they wing over, you get the one wing will always get a little more lift than the other,  because nothing's perfect.  So it wings over, and now they're upside down, falling, and goodbye.  Can you recover from that if you're at the right height, if you're at the right altitude?  From a wing over?  Yeah.  Yeah, it used to be a combat move.  You'd wing over and then go into an inside half loop and come out of it, go in the opposite 
[00:49:00]  direction.  It's like a really cool fucking move.  But if you have enough altitude, you can pretty much get out of anything.  I saw a goddamn 707 do a barrel roll.  Lost a lot of altitude, but he went all the way around.  He did all right.  Yeah, this is really fucking twisted.  Well, the first part of the transcript, the first line of the transcript, what?  Yeah, that right there sets the mood.  You know what, Jimmy?  I've got to cancel my L.A. trip.  I'll tell you why you don't.  No, you don't.  Yeah, because my confidence gets shattered when I read, like that first line shatters 
[00:49:30]  my confidence of flying.  That's okay.  You guys are taking Continental.  Oh.  757 planes piloted different.  This guy was not qualified to fly a 757.  She starts in the transcript by saying, are you ready?  No, he does.  Oh.  That's a he?  Renslow's a he?  Yeah, he said that.  What?  It's even worse.  I thought it was the broad that was saying this.  He's trying to be like, look how young I am.  Oh, my.  Hey, this is fun, right?  I told this chippy next to me.  Until this very moment, I thought it was the young, inexperienced co-pilot that said 
[00:50:00]  this.  No, Renslow is the guy.  Holy shit.  Well, Renslow, ready for this, kids?  He says, we, this is fun.  Yeah.  We, this is fun.  That's, uh.  I'm all about, like, pilots lightening up, lighten up the mood a little bit when you're  flying, like, you know, feeling you, making you feel good.  But I don't want to hear we, this is fun.  Now, if he's an experienced pilot, it would be, hey, this is routine. 
[00:50:30]  You know, that's what you want.  You don't want we, this is fun.  No.  Coming out of your pilot's mouth.  Never.  Uh, I think he was doing that just to, like, hey, you know, nudge the little chick next  to you.  Like, hey, fun, right?  We, this is fun.  And she says, yeah.  And then he says, autopilot's engaged.  She says, yeah, again.  And he goes, probably a good thing.  What?  Uh, why?  Because you can't fly the plane? 
[00:51:00]  Like, what the fuck?  It's not a good start.  Obviously, we know how this ends, but.  Yeah.  And then he decides to just recount a little story of a false fire report in the avionics  of a plane he was flying over Texas.  Ground support in Houston, uh, drove to Alexandria, Texas to fix the problem after he landed.  So he's giving a little, you know, a little manly, yeah, yeah, had a little problem, but  I dealt with it.  War stories.  Yeah, a little war story.  He's trying to pick her up. 
[00:51:30]  Faulty avionics.  He's trying to pick her up with war stories.  Yeah.  Did I ever tell you the time?  Because they changed the deal out.  Anyway, we went, of course, uh, after that day, uh, we all went to the, uh, steakhouse.  We ate a steak, baked potato, and drank a mess load of beer.  He's flirting with me.  And she goes, yeah, again.  Every answer she has is, yeah.  Which means she's not interested in his babble.  No.  And he goes, it was just one of those, one of those days, yeah. 
[00:52:00]  And she goes, one of those days where you have to have a few beers to, uh, at the end.  This sounds like me and Danny talking about the show.  Not fucking pilots.  Yeah.  Danny just goes, yeah.  Yeah.  And then, uh, Renslow, of course, he's going, that was a good time.  Um, I like flying the Saab.  Uh, Saab is another type of aircraft, uh, better.  Like, Saab makes some really kick-ass fucking planes.  I need an airplane to fly, not like this. 
[00:52:30]  And, uh, she goes, yeah, right.  And he says, uh, it, the Saab turboprop.  Um, like, mom's SUV or minivan, you know?  Soccer mom van.  Uh, you don't have to fly with your hands and your feet.  You just fly with your hands.  So they're just kind of talking, bullshitting around.  Renslow and Shaw continue.  Comparison of the Saab turboprop and their Dash Q400 Bombardierier.  Uh, I think it was, it's, uh, oh, Shaw says, I think it's fun flying with, with captains. 
[00:53:00]  Not so much any lately, but right at first they came from the Saab and they'd see, they'd see the rudder and they're like, aw, shit.  And kick it real hard and fling the plane back and forth.  Now the Saab, I guess, um, there's no, uh, foot pedal rudders.  I guess you'd fly it with your hands.  Mm-hmm.  Um, auto rudder or something.  I'm not familiar with that plane, but if you get in there, apparently some pilots get mad that there's a rudder and kick the pedals back and forth and the rear-ass end of the plane swings back and forth and they knock the flight crew, um, back and forth. 
[00:53:30]  Um, I don't know if this is done with passengers on the plane, maybe on the flight back, uh, kind of like I did a little while ago, Renslow says.  Uh, I flew with some captains that were doing it real bad, like knocking the flight attendants down in the back.  Yeah, that's.  And then they're laughing.  That's the girl saying that last line.  Yeah.  And the girl continues.  Girl continues, like, I'd see the flight attendants afterward and they were like, um, who's, who was flying? 
[00:54:00]  Uh, and then Renslow goes, that would be the bonehead captain.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  More, more laughter and hijinks.  Renslow receives instruction from air traffic control in Buffalo.  Renslow, 33, try not to be dyslexic.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Last time I flew in here, 233, the, uh, inbound course, I put in 223.  Ha ha ha. 
[00:54:30]  He's putting in the wrong fucking coordinates.  Uh, Renslow laments that the controllers up north aren't as laid back as the ones in Texas.  and he'd give us  this is Renslow  some type of clearance to Houston  Colgan 9526  you're cleared for the George Herbert Walker  George Herbert Walker  Bush Intergalactical Airport  ha ha ha ha  this guy's a 
[00:55:00]  regular fucking jokester isn't he  yeah he sure is  and then Renslow just continues  would you like me to read the girls part so you don't have to keep saying the names  oh okay please  I'll do it in my regular voice  yes and I would try to read it back  exactly the same way  when in the fair I don't know  you know about three or four months  before I left and  he was just as calm and quiet  you know I could tell it was him  said hey man what happened  to that Eastwood 
[00:55:30]  Airport information echo  he said yeah they clipped my wings  oh no they didn't like him doing that  I just like the flying  down there a whole lot better  oh yeah  oh it's lots of ice  yeah this is where we get into the  little ice  this is before the crash  they say  yeah lots of ice  this is about  about eight minutes  seven minutes after that  previous conversation  and six minutes before the crash  six minutes before they  actually crash 
[00:56:00]  yeah she said lots of ice  he goes oh yeah  that's the most ice I've seen  most ice I've seen  on the leading edge  in a long time  in a while anyway  I should say  flying in the northeast  I have 1600 hours  I had more actual time  on my first day of IOE  which is initial operating experience  than I did in the 1600 hours  I did when I came here  but as a matter of fact  I got hired with about  625 hours here  oh wow  that's not much for 
[00:56:30]  back when you got hired  no but  out of that  250 hours  was  port  121 turbine  multi-engine  turbine  oh that's right  yeah  I'm wondering right now  if she's realizing  oh god  there's a fucking issue  and yeah  he's not experienced  we're not experienced enough  to handle  because it looks like  they're looking at the ice  on the wing right  they can probably look out  and see the ice  they just started noticing  that there's a fuckload of ice  forming on the leading edge  of the wing  so she says  oh that's right 
[00:57:00]  yeah  no but all these guys  are complaining  they're saying  you know  how we're supposed to  be upgraded by now  I'm thinking  you know what  I really wouldn't mind  going through a winter  in the northeast  before I have to upgrade  to captain  I've never seen  icing conditions  I've never de-iced  I've never experienced  any of that  I don't want to have  to experience that  and make those kind of calls  you know  I'd have freaked out  I'd have freaked out  she said  I'd have freaked out  I'd have like  seen this much ice  and thought  oh my gosh  we're going to crash  she said that by the way  yeah these are all  direct quotes  from the co-pilot 
[00:57:30]  she said that  four minutes before  the actual crash  they actually  yeah crashed  GPWS  holy shit  GPWS landing flap  selected  15 degrees  fuel transfer off  hydraulic pressure  and quantity down  I'm sorry  quantity check  caution warning lights  check  seatbelt sign  check  on and external  lights  on and external  lights on  approach checklist  complete  and Renslow says  rock and roll  is he Johnny Race  now this is a few seconds  from the crash  this is 
[00:58:00]  yeah  what do you think  maybe 30 seconds  before the crash  no this is  3 minutes  3 minutes  22 hours  16 minutes  52 seconds  this is seconds  before the crash  yeah it is  22 hours  16 minutes  52 seconds  is the crash  oh I thought you meant  the rock and roll line  I'm sorry  the rock and roll line  when he said rock and roll  he was 4 minutes  from the crash  I'm sorry  3 or 4 minutes  yeah now you guys  are talking seconds  from the crash  seconds from the crash  yes you're right  I'm sorry  Shaw goes  gears down 
[00:58:30]  flaps 15  before landing checklist  sounds similar  to flap handle movements  so you hear that  ka-chunk  as he's moving  the flaps down  and now she gets  her first  little inkling  that there is  a huge fucking problem  she goes  sounds similar  to stick shaker  lasting  6.7 seconds  the stick shaker  is another thing  in a plane  in old planes 
[00:59:00]  fly-by-wire planes  which  actually  the control surface  of the plane  is mechanically linked  to your fucking  the yoke  or the stick  by linkages  wires  whatever it is  so if your plane  starts to stall  and you feel like  the plane will vibrate  pretty nasty  your stick  will have  vibrated  now they  electronically  put in  a shaker  which  actually  literally  shakes the yoke  to simulate 
[00:59:30]  that feeling  that the pilot  used to get  from the  control surfaces  shaking  so you can hear  the  the stick shaking  which means  we're fucking  stalling  the wing is stalling  it's not getting  enough air  over the surface  of the wing  to hold the plane  up in the air  yeah so  a stick shake  lasting  6.7 seconds  then we have  a similar sound  to autopilot  disconnect  horn repeats  until end of  recording 
[01:00:00]  so now you're  getting  autopilot  disconnect horn  sound of a  click  comes on  sound similar  to increase  in engine  power  now this is  like I said  the nose  is now  probably  pitching up  and down  because  the  plane  is trying  to  get speed  up  and also  increasing  the power  either  on its own  or the  pilot's  doing it  and then  Renslow  says  Jesus  Christ  not a 
[01:00:30]  good thing  you want  the pilot  to be  saying  sound  similar  to stick  shaker  lasting  until  end  of  recording  and then  she says  I put  the flaps  up  sound  of  two  clicks  sound  of  grunt  unintelligible  the bear  and then  she asked  yes  I don't  understand  what  Renslow  is trying  to say  he's grunting  he's probably  he's fighting  the controls  well  the  their bear  their bear  their bear  their bear  their bear  their bear 
[01:01:00]  but that's  the end  of some  kind  of word  they  they  can't  their bear  unintelligible  their bear  yeah  and then  she says  should the  gear be up  gear up  oh  shit  or fuck  it says  expletive  but I'm  thinking  gear up  oh shit  increase  in ambient  noise  so uh  you're getting  a lot of  um  a lot of  uh  cockpit  noise  I guess  warnings  maybe  maybe  whooshing 
[01:01:30]  things like  that  and then  Renzo says  we're down  wait  so he's  talking after  the hit  the ground  I don't  think that  means that  no  no I'm  thinking  see he  goes  gear up  oh shit  so now  the thump  he goes  we're down  I think  he's just  you know  the fact  that there's  nothing he  can do  he goes  we're down  we're crashing  we're down  the sound  of thump  which I'm  thinking is  the gear  kicking up  although  gear up  at  22  16  46 
[01:02:00]  46  47  48  49  50  51  uh  five seconds  for gear  up  maybe  that sounds  about right  doesn't it  yeah  on a small  plane like that  that could have  been the gear  coming up  uh  and then  Shaw just  says  that's the  the girl  she says  we're  we're  that's it  and then  sound of scream  I bet you  that's when  they finally  because they  show graphics  where it's  going left  and right  and forward  and backwards  and I bet you  the scream  comes when 
[01:02:30]  they actually  finally roll  upside down  and pitch  straight down  straight in  yeah  there's nothing  they could  uh  do at that  point  if they  weren't  now they're  saying you  know if  they weren't  talking so  much  blabbing  their way  to icy  doom  is what the  headline is  here  crew kept  up chat  amid  a wing  freeze  um  glaring  signs  small talk  became big  problem  yeah if  you  if the  first  if the 
[01:03:00]  first thing  you say  about icing  is this  is the  most ice  I've ever  seen  perhaps you  should have  noticed it  a little  sooner  and and  stopped  your yapping  yep  with uh  your your  little uh  little chippy  co-pilot  yeah he's flirting  with her as the  ice is just  building up  outside the  windows  no one's  looking outside  no one's  looking at  the fucking  icing conditions  on your  plane  unbelievable  that's why  I won't fly  those little  planes  if I do  Pittsburgh  or something  like that  Continental  is running  these routes  now  where they  used to  use the  embrayers  which are  like 51 
[01:03:30]  seat jets  which fly  the speed  of a jet  even though  they're small  these are  propellers  and I won't  fly  I will not  do it  you won't  fly turbo  not fly  the prop  they frighten  me man  uh  let's say  hi to  Tony  in Texas  you're on  the Opie and  Anthony show  Tony  hey  morning guys  good morning  what I got  out of it  when he said  we're down  I think  is meaning  that the gear  is still  down  after they  were trying  oh really  yeah that's  what I was  thinking  it's like  oh shit  we're still  down  like the gear  is still  down  we're down  oh I got  you  yeah it  didn't go up 
[01:04:00]  like they  thought it  was supposed  to  that's why  it took  so long  that's where  I got out  of it  maybe  I think  at that  point  it didn't  matter  if the  fucking  gear  was up  down  falling  off  the  plane  or  anything  okay  let's go to  Andrew in Queens  Andrew  yeah I was reading  the paper  it's kind of  funny  slash ironic  the first  first line  they say  and then the  last line  they say  what  we  we  this is  fun  and then the  last line  we're  fucked  and she's  screaming  it's kind  of crazy  yeah there's  a couple 
[01:04:30]  different emotions  going on  we  this is  fun  and then the  last one  we're dead  she doesn't  say we're  anything  she says we're  like I bet  you that they  were going  back like left  and right  and she was  probably going  we're gonna  flip and then  all of a sudden  they flipped  and she just  lost her  thought and  screamed  yeah  I don't  think she  cursed  at that  point  creepy  alright  boys  well we'll  talk to a  corporate pilot  I'm not  right on  everything  Dan the  corporate pilot  Dan the  man 
[01:05:00]  what's up  man  what's up  guys  what was  going on  in there  well  what happened  was they  had the  autopilot  on way  too long  I mean  that stick  trigger came  on  yeah  and  within  less than a  second they  should have  the autopilot  off  really  yeah  at that  point  you're  at a  thousand  feet  and  when  you're  in  a  stall  I mean  you're  going to  lose  altitude  and  at that  point  you're  way too  low  to try  to recover  so I mean  you're  going to  hit the  ground  so they  were fucked 
[01:05:30]  regardless  at that  altitude  at that  point  I mean  yeah  they should  have been  paying more  attention  what would  you do  about  de-icing  the wings  if you  noticed  ice  building up  what  should they  have done  earlier on  if they  noticed  ice was  building up  well  okay  as far  as I  know  that  airplane  has  boots  I mean  I don't  fly that  airplane  I fly  jet  it's  different  but it  still  has  what they  call  de-ice  boots  and they're  like  rubber  boots  in the  front 
[01:06:00]  that  inflate  to break  the ice  whether  it has  auto  anti-ice  I'm not  sure  because  some  airplanes  they come  on  automatically  other  airplanes  like  you have  to turn  it on  manually  so  if  if  it  wasn't  on  they  should  have  it  on  obviously  but  if  it  was  already  on  then  the  whole  flying it  with the  autopilot  I mean  like  they  could  have  had  like  the  autopilot 
[01:06:30]  trimmed  the airplane  a certain  way  and  when  it's  trimmed  it  nosed  up  or  it  will  trim  the  airplane  nosed  up  when  you  have  ice  on  the  wings  because  the  wing  is  getting  less  lift  the  ice  on  the  wings  is  obviously  not  good  and  so  if  it's  already  trimmed  up  and  it  starts  getting  into  a  stall  situation  by  the  time  you  shut  off  the  autopilot  you're  going to  have  to be  fighting  all kinds  of  forces  from  the  trim  to  the  stick  pusher  and  you're 
[01:07:00]  going to  be  losing  altitude  right  there  and  at  low  altitude  you  are  sort  of  fucked  could  could  they  have  when  they  noticed  the  ice  if  they  increased  speed  were  they  doomed  by  that  point  or  could  they  have  picked  up  a little  bit  of  altitude  and  speed  and  fixed  the  wings  well  yeah  if  they  noticed  it  I mean  they  would  have  had  no  I  mean  when  they  did  notice  it  like  a  couple  of  minutes  a  few  minutes  before  the  crash  it  sounds  like  that's  what  they  tried 
[01:07:30]  to  do  bring  up  the  flaps  and  the  gear  and  just  goose  it  and  that's  a matter  of  technique  a lot  of  people  say  once  you  get  yourself  in  a  situation  you  leave  everything  where  it  is  try  to  recover  and  once  you  recover  then  start  cleaning  up  the  airplane  because  if  you  got 
[01:08:00]  so  much  shit  hanging  off  of  there  and  ice  you  should  probably  start  sucking  up  some  of  those  surfaces  the  gear  wasn't  down  they  noticed  the  ice  six  minutes  before  they  crashed  this  was  10  10  at  night  they  noticed  the  ice  first  line  is  she  goes  oh  yeah  oh  it's  lots  of  ice  and  he  goes  yeah  that's  the  most  ice  I've  ever  seen  they  didn't  crash  for  six  minutes  like  the  landing  gear  was  not  down  at  point  how  about  solving  the  ice  problem  before  you  then  get  yourself  into  a  big  problem  like  if  he  was  a 
[01:08:30]  more  experienced  guy  in  this  situation  would  he  have  known  that  ice  is  going  to  be  a  problem  in  a  couple  of  minutes  let's  pick up  altitude  and go  to  Montreal  or wherever  you go  to fly  north  yeah  that's  exactly  what it is  they have  a 600  hour  pilot  in  the  right  seat  which  is  way  too  little  hours  to  put  anybody  in  an  airline  I  think  I  used  to  fly  for  the  airlines  and  they  didn't  hire me  unless  a thousand  so I  don't  they  didn't  know 
[01:09:00]  the  severity  of the  situation  until it  happened  they  see  the  ice  and you  fly  the  ice  all  the  time  you  see  the  ice  but  they  see  the  ice  and  they  are  like  we'll  be  fine  it  will  break  off  until  they  put  the  flaps  down  and  they  realize  oh  shit  we  got  a  problem  how  many  hours  do  you  need  to  fly  like  a  757  passenger  plane  well  that  okay  first  you gotta  get the  job  with  the  airline  and  when  usually  you 
[01:09:30]  need  at  least  2,500  hours  with  the  airline  and  then  from  there  whatever  like  however  long  it  takes  you  to  climb  up  the  seniority  list  is  how many hours you're going to have to get to  Yeah they train you  they train you  don't they  the airline  itself will hire you  and then train you  to fly a certain aircraft  right  yeah exactly  and when you get in on the bottom  or you know  at the  bottom of the seniority list  you're going to fly the smallest airplane they have  yeah 
[01:10:00]  that's the way  you know  it's all about seniority  yeah  yeah  so basically  if you're on a small plane  less experienced  pilots  yep  pretty much  I hate flying in winter man  and this isn't going to help that  that fear  yeah  I mean  unfortunately that's the way it's got to be  but you know  everything's got to be brought up  from the bottom line  yep  because  they hire  you know  first officers  with 400 hours  and then you basically have one experience  piloting the airplane  yeah  I'm sort of a big proponent for 
[01:10:30]  you know  putting your work  before you start working for the airlines  because when I went to the airlines  I had 1200 hours  is um  is like the propeller plane like this  this is obviously  like I guess I fly the  I try to fly the Embraers  with the 51 seat  and the jet engines  those are less likely to have icing right  well actually  that airplane has a lot better  of an anti-ice system  because that has an automatic  anti-ice system  I used to fly that airplane  for American Eagle  what the Embraer  yeah  exactly  and  and it doesn't have boots  it has what they call 
[01:11:00]  a heated wing  which is a lot more  effective  in  melting off the ice  do you have to  do you have to add  a lot of power  before you inflate  that leading edge  yeah  um  I would assume like  just  that  that depends on the airplane  yeah  some airplanes  it'll work fine  with little power  some airplanes  have to add a lot of power  for  for the anti-ice  to work  yeah  it would seem like  it would really  fuck up the  aerodynamics of the wing  a little bit there  it sure does  I feel like 
[01:11:30]  I'm in French class  and it's a class  where you know  they refuse to speak  English  I'm asking  five year old  boy questions  does the plane  go faster  with big engines  I know nothing  I'm going to fly  during the winter time  and there's Anthony  two aliens  talking  pilots  like aircraft  I know you do  it's your hobby  alright sir  thank you  thank you  Dan the corporate pilot  yes sir  if you need  any help with anything  I'll be glad to be  an instructor 
[01:12:00]  oh you're an instructor too  yeah  out of where  well  out of Houston  but  if you pay me  better than my current job  might as well  add another person  on the payroll  personal pilot  that'd be awesome  alright Dan  take it easy man  listen  we have a lot of phone calls  but we're also getting word  that Ron Howard's  going to be here  in like a few minutes  and we should probably  take a break  and regroup  so we can get ready  for Ron Howard  do you want any of these  calls real fast Dan  but I think  we covered it  with that guy 
[01:12:30]  you know  there's other people  a lot of interest  in this topic  obviously  the phones are lit  a lot of pilots  listen  which is kind of cool  we all fly  and we're all scared  that a pilot  is not as experienced  as you need him to be  that's the scariest part  yeah  by the way  because people are wondering  because we did bring it up yesterday  how did the meeting go yesterday  after the show  it went  it went  it went  what do we tell these people  we gotta give them  party A  spoke with party B  yeah  and  they didn't see it  our way  whatsoever  that was about it  they didn't see it 
[01:13:00]  our way  whatsoever  yeah  well  what are you gonna do  and honestly  I hate to admit this  but we just gotta  take it  yeah  that's all I can say  but we are  we just have to take it  yeah  and that's kind of tough to say  but that's the  that's the reality  we're faced with  professionals  we'll do the program  yeah  we'll have a fine show  to the best of our abilities  that's what we do  we're already having a good show  and it continues with Ron Howard  hopefully next  stay there  Opie and Anthony  it's Opie and Anthony 
[01:13:30]  Jim Norton  Ron Howard  gonna be on the show  in a few minutes here  from Angels and Demons  I'll be on Red Eye tomorrow too  if anybody gives a turkey  we give a turkey  I certainly do  excuse my language  you know  we gotta talk to Ron Howard  about his greatest project ever  you wanna guess  what the greatest project ever was  for Ron Howard  um  don't cheat  for  well  his greatest project ever  I know what 
[01:14:00]  in my humble opinion  I know what  my favorite is  what's your favorite  Apollo 13  oh of course  I should  it was great  mine is Happy Days  mine  Arrested Development  my friends  oh yeah  Arrested Development  executive producer  and uncredited narrator  of Arrested Development  supposedly they're making that  into a movie too  although if you couldn't  identify his voice  as the narrator  I like how they write  uncredited narrator  god I wonder who this guy is  very distinct voice 
[01:14:30]  that Arrested Development  sometimes they make shows  that  I don't know  they're too smart  or something  yeah  are they trying to say  they were all a bunch of  dummies that watch TV  yeah  because it doesn't get  the proper ratings  or whatever  and then they go  it's gotta be a bad show  not as good as  Will and Grace  I love when they made  those gay references  oh so funny  all the major sitcoms  except for Seinfeld  I never  I just couldn't be bothered  yeah  you ever see like  Ray Romano's show 
[01:15:00]  the first season was good  did you see a lot  of the first season  yeah  to me they're all  the same sitcom  with a little tweaking  yeah  it just fell into  that whole  rut sitcom thing  the first season  was kind of funny  he was good  you know  the brother was good  in the first season  no  ah  what are you doing  the first season  was good  but then  the characters  they wind up becoming  like caricatures  of themselves 
[01:15:30]  like the brother  if you watch the brother  in the first season  it's different  than the brother  in like the last season  very talented actors  and all that  they become  they kind of  see what becomes  popular with them  and then overdo it  yeah  like Fonzie  by season 6  had like the rhinestone  jacket  you know  he was just  yeah  first season  Fonzie had  a windbreaker on  and yeah  I don't think  they ever showed him  on a motorcycle  he was just walking around  he was the quiet 
[01:16:00]  and he was quiet  he was like a quiet guy  we should ask Ron Howard  why he never kicked  Fonzie's ass  yeah well I take that  crap from Fonzie  you had the reach  on him  alright  when was Fonzie  doing all this fighting  that he  he obviously  on my lifts  he obviously  was in a lot  of fights  where the word  got around  don't mess  with Fonzie  yeah Fonzie  was tough  but he  but we never  saw him fight  once  and he didn't  have a build  Fonzie was not built  no he was a little  Jewish gentleman  yeah  Fonzie was built  like my accountant 
[01:16:30]  who did he beat up  who did he beat up  Jenny Piccolo  but he had the  you know  the slick back hair  and he  let a jacket  in the later  seasons  and then  and then he always  got the chicks  look at the Fonz  look at the picture  of the Fonz  didn't Fonzie make  Ron Howard like  kiss the wall  in the bathroom  wasn't he practicing  lip ups  did he call them  lip ups  or something  I think he did  they called him  in my office  and they'd go into  the bathroom  together with 
[01:17:00]  a hole in the stall  somebody shitting  in his office  what's going on  with Fonzie  that his office  is in the bathroom  Fonzie would just  yeah  Fonzie would just  bang on the door  and someone  would come running out  yes Fonz  who would be afraid  of a guy  who's putting  his thumbs up  yeah  hey look  every picture  he's like  hey  alright  what photographer  was like  alright  I need something  different  could you put  your thumbs up  do that in every  fucking shot  I'm sick of it  I guarantee you  every fan picture 
[01:17:30]  he takes  he thumbs up  it's gotta go  hey  poor Henry  he's so tired  he wants to cut  his own thumbs  off and throw  them  chop them off  with fucking  wire cutters  he's still doing  it I'm sure  with the awful  gray hair  probably didn't  really change  his hairstyle  because he wants  people to recognize  him as the Fonz  I love that  about celebrities  they have some  weird look that  worked in the  70s let's say  or the 80s  yeah  and you see  them nowadays  they got the  exact same look  because they want  to be recognized  still  that's the only  reason  I don't 
[01:18:00]  have a really  good example  maybe  Gossage  maybe when we  saw him  he had the  Goose Gossage  he had the  crazy mustache  oh there it is  he's still  growing it like  that because  he wants to  be recognized  by his fans  he's water  skiing with  his leather  jacket on  because that  was the episode  where he jumped  over the shark  causing the  whole saying  it's amazing  how bad that  episode was  like how bad  that idea is  they're all  worried on the  beach  and he's  jumping a  shark  water skiing  holy mackerel 
[01:18:30]  ask Ron Howard  about that one  yeah  what did you  guys call it  like we call  it jumping  the shark  what did you  call it  yeah  we episode  103'd it  yeah we  103'd man  hey out of  respect when  Ron Howard's  in here  can you call  me Greg  yeah  yeah  out of  respect  dude I got  my name from  him  it's a little  bizarre to be  like uh  yeah  welcome to  the Opie and  Anthony show  and he'll  look at me  how about we  call you Ron  yeah  hey can we 
[01:19:00]  get intern  David I guess  they did his  makeover  oh it was  intern David  makeover  yeah we're  we're waiting  for Ron Howard  to go from  one studio  to the other  here  down the  green mile  jesus  oh my  dead man  walking  dead man  walking  here  speaking of  the funds  he looks  like Bowser  yes  he does  look like  Bowser  oh no  don't like  the funds  yeah  wow  oh my god

[01:20:00]  good  uh  good  uh  there he  goes  wow  he's almost  doing the  Bowser  kinda  on the  other arm  there's  a lightning  bolt  and you  can see  his new  nickname  show him  your other  arm  David  David  lightning  oh lightning  yeah  David  Jewish  lightning  that's when  they burn  the place  down  to get  the insurance  money  yeah  wow  you're not  looking tough  though  you're smiling  when you  take the 
[01:20:30]  picture  now he's  shenanahing  well can you  see the chunks  of Joe  in his hair  it's tough  there are  chunks  of gel  in that  hair  how hard  is it  to get  that  poof out  well  I actually  decided to  just dump  like half the  jar of gel  in his hair  and let it  sit on top  and then I  sprayed him  with hair  spray  and then I  told him to  go talk to  Troy  because Troy  knows more  about hair  jolly  than I do  did you cut  the sleeves  off his  really nice  white t-shirt  yeah he was  wearing  his parents  are gonna 
[01:21:00]  kill you guys  I asked  permission  if we could  cut the sleeves  off his shirt  so he would  look cooler  and he reluctantly  said yes  who drew  the tats  that was me  and Troy  combined  oh okay  I could see  you did  the skull  and crossbones  and he did  the heart  that's correct  yeah I could  tell because  there's such  different artistry  there  yours looks  like an infant  drew it  I did the  teardrops too  yeah  oh  and his eye  and what does  that represent  that you've  killed somebody  well either  that you've 
[01:21:30]  committed a homicide  or you've  done a bit  in prison  oh  I thought  you had  so we're  disrespecting  some guys  out there  today  David  will walk  out on the  street  and just get  his ass  handed to him  no kidding  the spider web  also apparently  is a biker  thing that means  you've killed  someone  I heard that  was rumor  I heard that's  rumor  go to Snopes  I know it's  rumor  just means you  have spiders  on you  yeah there's  spiders on  your elbows  means you  got bit  by a spider  in the middle  of the night  well you  could stop  flexing  it's radio 
[01:22:00]  he's flexing  and not talking  he's flexing  he's in  space  when you make  a muscle  his ass cheeks  actually tighten  up  his whole body  what do you think  David  could you take  your glasses off  let me see  what you look  like without  your glasses  maybe a little  tougher  he's growling  and not looking  tough at all  you could not  look tough  but I think  he feels  tougher 
[01:22:30]  he does  he feels  different  he definitely  feels tougher  he's got a  different attitude  about himself  here  how do you feel  David  tough  I feel  very tough  he's erring  you see the  tattoo on the  eye  the uh  yeah  the uh  the drop  he's making  crazy eyes  yeah  how long do you  think you'd  he is  he's fucking  David Lightning  how long do you  think you'd last  in prison  in prison  oh no  probably not 
[01:23:00]  too long  yeah huh  before what  would happen  or I'd get  knocked on the  ground or  beaten up or  something  what do you  think would  happen to you  in the shower  in prison  in the shower  yeah what do you  think would  happen  probably get  punched in the  face or something  and beaten up  and then what  and then molested  or mutilated or  something  all right  give yourself a  bell  yeah  it was suggested 
[01:23:30]  that we do the  tattoos with dry  erase marker  and that way  after the show  we could just  wash them off  but the dry  erase marker  was all the way  on the other  side of the  office  so why bother  I did the  sharpie  sharpie comes  off so easy  off your skin  especially when  you color it  in on the  face  yeah  yeah  I like  Danny's picture  he's got up  he looks like  one of the  Gotti boys  oh yeah  sort of  all right  well that's all  we got there  David  thank you  all right  sure  what else  are we going  to do  you're going  to walk  around like  that the  whole day  now right  yes sir  the whole day  you kind of

[01:24:30]  put this  together  we had  Eddie Money  in studio  certainly did  he was great  are you going  to go see  that one man  show of his  in Dix Hills  at some point  I have his  phone number  I could call  him and get  tickets  oh I got a  lot of  okay  I saw a lot  of people  kind of  walking by  I thought  yeah usually  you just start  seeing people  arrive and then  finally  yeah yeah  then you see  and go hey  I know that  that's when you  know you're  talking to like  an A-lister  yeah  a lot of  a lot of our  guests they come  by themselves  yeah I know 
[01:25:00]  they just kind  of wander in  between us  and other shows  they have trouble  at security  right  sorry guys  I would have  been here an  hour ago  yeah  they didn't  believe that I  was here to  do an  interview  but lately  getting some  of the A-listers  where you see  the entourage  kind of nice  the entourage  is an interesting  cycle  to say the least  when Ron walks  in we should  just go  what  yeah that'll  work  you're interrupting  anyway  Eddie Money  Eddie  we noticed 
[01:25:30]  that he was  quite the  jokester  yeah  so Derek and  Steve put this  together  Eddie Money  taught a generation  how to rock  and how to  love  now Long  Island's own  Money Man  is trying  to make you  laugh  I like coming  back to New York  I like coming  back to New York  but I like  playing in LA  because I get  to sleep  in my own  house  you know  I'm actually  from Plain  Edge  Levertown  Levertown  never down  baby  it's Eddie 
[01:26:00]  Money's  one night  stand up  my probation  officer came  to the show  the other night  I said you know  I'm looking  for some clean  urine  my blood type  is big  can anybody  help me out  come on  you'll get  it  that's right  these are the  jokes that  Henny Youngman  used to wipe  his ass with  and that  motherfucker's  been dead  for over  a decade  I worked  in the  couple  police  but  he was  a great  guy  he was  an  undercover  typist  Eddie Money's  invested 30  years in the  music business  and has  dozens of  hit songs 
[01:26:30]  now he's  going to  torpedo  that legacy  with a  CD full  of stale  dog shit  one liners  I tell you  my wife  doesn't do  any drugs  at all  but when I  first met  I got a  load of  my weed  I thought  I was  going to  get a  great piece  of ass  and then I  got laid  suck my  dick  you'll want  to take  yourself home  tonight  rip open a vein  and bleed out  listening to  Eddie Money's  crusty old  jokes  Cialis is my  new drug  you've never  waited so long  for someone  to shut  the fuck  up  I got  two tickets  to your  funeral 
[01:27:00]  it's Eddie  Money's  one night  stand up  not available  in stores  thank god  that's mean  spirited  yeah Steve  I would have  I like a lot  of the work  Steve does  but in that  case  I would have  liked it  without profanity  and I would  have liked it  promoting the  jokes like they  were good  yeah yeah  promoting it  like it was a  great comedy  CD about to be  released  yeah yeah  that he's  going into  comedy  I agree  with Jimmy  on this  one  you play  it  you play 
[01:27:30]  laughs  behind it  like he's  killing  with those  jokes  he's terrific  yeah yeah  and they're  just horrid  you want  them to  redo it  or what  like Eddie  was so good  on the show  and it's  it's just  nasty  towards him  it really  is very  nasty  towards him  did you  wake Steve  up  and you know  what some  of those jokes  actually worked  on the show  yeah  and it's like  you know  as bad as  they might  be  what the hell  is wrong  with Steve  what's Steve's  problem  with fucking  Eddie Money  and this 
[01:28:00]  fucking asshole  why is  Eddie Youngman  a motherfucker  who's been  dead for 10  years  why'd you  put a  motherfucker  in there  what did  Eddie do  to you  what did  he do  to your  family  what happened  did you  owe your  grandpa some  money or  something  where's  the anger  what did  he call  Eddie Youngman  a motherfucker  why'd you  call Eddie  Youngman  a motherfucker  Steve  you know  what I was  wrestling with  that line  I was toiling  over what to  what to  you lost the  match  yeah  that's what  I thought  the you know  I was writing  and I'm like  well the only  one liner guy  I could think of 
[01:28:30]  to reference  was Henny  Youngman  and then the  question was  well do you  just say that  guy or do you  say that  asshole  or just he  he's been  dead  but I would  change  I would like  to see you  do this  with a  really a  sweet tone  like this is  the great  comedy CD  and some laughs  behind it  and promote it  like it's a  damn good CD  of some damn  fresh jokes  alright  any tongue  in cheek  in there  at all  or no  no tongue  in cheek  I think the  tongue in cheek  is the actual  material  that he says  alright  redo  I think the  tongue in cheek  would be the  fact that the 
[01:29:00]  jokes are bad  and if there's  a laugh track  behind jokes  that are not  good  thank you  and less cursing  yes  alright  thank you very much  you angry man  you  just sorry  if our gang  just brought me  coffee  holy shit  Jim  check your email  hey spank  I emailed that  to you last  night asking  too much  you know  asking specifically  was this too much  oh I was busy  coming  I see someone  with a hat  is this  oh this is a  giant entourage 
[01:29:30]  that's Ron  oh my god  that's Ron  this is a giant  entourage coming  down here  oh my god  why don't we  clean up the  area where Ron's  gonna sit  yeah don't give  him that  Hollywood newspaper  in front of  there  and such  and such  and what not  ladies and gentlemen  Ron Howard  how you doing  what's up Ron  can we call you  Ron or Mr. Howard  Ron  I know  he's like  but I answered  almost anything  Ron you know 
[01:30:00]  why you're here  what happened  to Chuck  that's such a  deep dark  complicated question  actually we want  to ask you  why no one  ever beat up  fonts  we talk about  that on our  show all the  time  he's this  tough guy  but you know  we never saw  him fight  anybody  but everyone  was scared  of him  the beauty  of it  the beauty  of it  it's all  mental  you had the  reach on him  and everything  if you just  would have cracked  him once  he never would  have bossed  you around  like that  dragged into 
[01:30:30]  the bathroom  all the time  it was a little  weird  I gotta be honest  we used to  wonder about it  ourselves  yeah  here they go again  we were talking  about this just  earlier too  what do you guys  call it when  some show does  something that's  awful and  kind of ruins  the flow of  the show  throughout a few  seasons  like we would  call it  jump the shark  right  do you actually  call it  episode 60  something like that  no we call it  jump the shark  did you know 
[01:31:00]  at that point  that maybe  ah  there was a  little  undercurrent of  eye rolling  yeah  you know  among all of us  and yet the fact  the matter is  you know  it was fun  we were getting  to be outside  we didn't have  to be stuck  on the stage  on stage 19  you know  we were  and outdoors  and the thing  got great ratings  and all that stuff  yeah  the first  couple of seasons  of Happy Days  was so much  different from  the last few  seasons  the first couple 
[01:31:30]  of seasons  it was done  on film  yeah  and just had  more of that  American graffiti  love American style  kind of look to it  yeah  and when the decision  was made  to switch over  to video  live audience  thing  did that bother  people  well it always  stayed on film  but  oh that's right  it did  okay  it didn't bother  people  because it was  so much more  I don't know  electric  and we were  competing with shows  that were working  with live audiences  and those shows  had a kind of  an energy  and the other style 
[01:32:00]  although it was  more comfortable  for me  because it was  more like movies  or even going back  more like the  Andy Griffith show  which was a  one camera show  and I was the rookie  I hadn't done  any stage at all  and everybody else  they were all  stage veterans  even the young guys  how would you be the rookie  when everybody  you know  you were in the business  for forever  I was getting nauseous  before you know  every show  for the first year  that we did it that way  but you know  in retrospect  as a director  I was so glad  that we did it  because later  it taught me  so much more  about comedy  because when you  really are dealing  with an audience 
[01:32:30]  and you actually  are hearing  what gets a laugh  what doesn't  what's the timing  how you can  screw up a joke  you know  what makes  how you can  intensify a laugh  and things like that  it really helped later  when I started directing  things like Night Shift  and Splash  and others  to know that  sometimes it's just  an energy breather  it's just  it's a lean  there's just sometimes  something that will  propel a laugh forward  that you can't write  there's like a  kind of a  yeah there's a rhythm  to it  and there's  sort of an algebra  I mean the comedy  writers are fantastic  the way they'll  break down a thing  and you know 
[01:33:00]  you change a syllable  and suddenly it gets a laugh  then it's funny  yeah  put the funny word  at the end of the sentence  instead of in the middle  so you don't step all over it  and Gary Marshall was brilliant  he was like this great teacher  because we'd do the run-throughs  do the run-throughs  he was a creator of the show  and he's also a great director now  but then he was sort of  one of the kings of television  and he'd come in  and we've done the show  and suddenly he would give like  eight notes  and they'd be little things like that  change a word  why don't you lean in  take a pause  and every time 
[01:33:30]  suddenly that new fix  would just make it a joke  make it a laugh  get a laugh  he was kind of  you know  a genius at it  yeah  how did you  how did you avoid  the obvious pitfalls  of child stardom  and keep your career going  and then get into directing  I mean  it's one of those things  where it's very rare  that you do see that  from a child star  especially from the  era where  a lot of people  had no money afterwards  there wasn't  as many laws in place  you know  it's luck  I mean  first of all  I was already at that point 
[01:34:00]  where money was put aside  but my folks were great  and did put the money aside  so when I turned 18  you know  I was in good shape  from Andy Griffith's show  and all that  and you knew you wanted  to go into directing  pretty early on  I knew really early  I knew really early  by the time  I used to even talk about it  when I was  like eight or nine  but by the time  I was 14 or 15  I was thinking about it  every day  telling Andy Griffith  he should stand over here  I think it would be better  if Barney comes in  off the left  you know  the thing is  about that show 
[01:34:30]  is that the environment  was unbelievably creative  and it was fun  and yet  because of Andy  who set this tone  all eight years  never getting lazy about it  it was really about  doing something for the audience  let's make this as good  as it can be  and nobody ever  walked through it  nobody would ever  be allowed to be  and yet  there was a lot of laughter  on the set  and as a director  one of the reasons  I like working with Tom Hanks  so much  is he has that understanding  he has that quality 
[01:35:00]  of you know  we don't have to make this  an agonizing experience  we can have a lot of laughs  and yet  you know  we're here for one reason  and we're  you know  we're trying to achieve  some level of excellence  when you  when you killed  that bird  I know  that's a  yeah  yeah  and then had to nurse  the little baby birds  I actually bumped into  that episode  did you  and watched it  about a couple of months ago  yeah  how is that for you  watching  because  all I can  equate that to  is watching  home movies  of when you're 
[01:35:30]  a little kid  you know  but I mean  this was seen  by everybody  what do you feel  when you're watching those  well two things happen  first of all  it is like home movies  because I remember  do you critique yourself also  and that's part two  really  I wind up critiquing it  at such a young age  and now you still look back  and go  ah  what a dummy  I could have done this  yeah  but  it was  you know  it was  it was  just a great  jumping off place  that show  absolutely  and I'm  you know  and I  it used to  it used to bother me  people would say  hey Opie 
[01:36:00]  hey Richie  or Eddie Murphy  hey Opie Cunningham  or whatever  and  it's  and  now I just view it  as this  this  this great nickname  and  and you know  because as a director  I've been able to achieve  the things that I wanted to achieve  yeah you transcended that  whole thing  where you know  some people have to do that  for the rest of their life  and they're you know  working in parking garages  or something  you're you know  obviously a  name director  you've made a few films  I think we've seen  Frost Nixon  Frost Nixon  blew me away  yeah  thank you  do you see Frost Nixon 
[01:36:30]  no I haven't seen that yet  it was  I didn't know what to expect  I'm like  that's kind of a documentary  type thing  it was amazing  how good it was  it was a good  it was been a great two years  because I was working  on Frost Nixon  and Angels and Demons  kind of simultaneously  preparing them both  and I shot Frost Nixon  did a little editing  then went and shot  Angels and Demons  then finished up Frost Nixon  and put it out  while I was editing  so they're two totally  different movies  because Angels and Demons  has all this action  these big sort of  violent set pieces  they're really intense  I mean it's quite different  from Da Vinci Code 
[01:37:00]  in that way  in that this is really  about Jeopardy  and you know  a ticking bomb  and as a director  I'd never really made a film  that was that intense  and sustained it  for that long  maybe a little  like Backdraft  in some ways  but you know  you and Tom Hanks  must be on a level now  where you can just  get together  and work  without having to  really even talk  to each other  you know  it's always kind of  been like that  and maybe because  we both came out of TV  maybe it's just  a similar sensibility  but going back  on Splash  I remember thinking 
[01:37:30]  you know  I'm a couple years  older than Tom  but I was a veteran  compared to Tom  at that point  I remember thinking  look how relaxed  this guy is  look how creative  he is  and then when I  worked with him  on Apollo 13  I saw that  he was all that  and yet  he'd reached  this other level  which is what gives him  so much power  as a dramatic actor  which is he's not  just entertaining  he's engrossing  even when he's not talking  he's like taking you  the audience on a story  and now with Da Vinci Code 
[01:38:00]  and now Angels and Demons  it's a whole other  different kind of movie  it's a different kind of character  and I really like  what he's doing  with that Robert Langdon  character  from Da Vinci Code  to Angels and Demons  it's kind of like  he's taking charge  of the movie version  of that character  and it's really fun  for me  as a director  and also as his friend  to just sort of see  how brilliant he is  and how smart he is  about what he does  and yet  he's having laughs  and enjoying himself  he's one of these actors  that kind of got past  the comedic actor thing 
[01:38:30]  which obviously  and amazingly  he brings that  even into serious roles  when you see him  in Saving Private Ryan  a horrific movie  yet that humor  that he has  really comes through  in whatever he does  you can tell  he's genuinely  a funny guy  he genuinely is  and I think  you know  and he was able  to get a lot more humor  into this latest  The Angels and Demons  but again  a lot of that 
[01:39:00]  has to do with  the style of the story  because it's flowing  it's a little more chaotic  it's a little more intense  and so  for him to come in  with a good line  once in a while  really eases the tension  and it's very entertaining  Can I ask something  for the readers out there  now Angels and Demons  was the first Dan Brown book  so how did you make it  into a sequel  when it probably  should have been  a prequel  well there  maybe a little  technical question  but  no it was  first of all  as many millions  of people  who've read  both Da Vinci Code  and Angels and Demons 
[01:39:30]  we all read  Da Vinci Code first  and then went  wait a minute  this guy had another book  so for them  it was almost like  a sequel already  in my mind  and also  even though a lot  of people have read it  millions more  have seen the movies  and so  I thought  you know  for them  it was important  to do it this way  also  Da Vinci Code  cinematically  is about  sort of  a philosophical idea  it's about  it's controversy  it deals a lot  with the past  it necessitated 
[01:40:00]  a lot of conversation  and explanation  in order to tell the story  and it was sort of  it was that first  and kind of  the mystery thriller second  it's reversed  in this one  and it's a much more  violent  intense  dangerous situation  that Langdon  is coming into  and I felt like  that  it was better  to have established  the character  in the other movie  and now  throw him into  an even more  intense situation  in this one  and so  for movie audiences  and also for Tom  to play the part  you know 
[01:40:30]  it makes more sense  to follow that story  with this more intense one  I'm looking forward  to one other question  now that  the church is  finally off your back  with this movie  right  because for a while  there  we have Bill Donahue  on our show  from time to time  and I get frustrated  with the guy  because he came out  against you  and then I go  well Bill  have you seen the movie  and he goes  ah  and he does it  all the time  because he did it  with a few other  projects he had  problems with  and our first question  with the guy  is well  did you see  the movie 
[01:41:00]  that you have  a problem with  and he goes  I'm not going to  be bothered  with that  but you're  all over the press  talking about it  you don't even know  what you're talking about  well you know  look that's my frustration  as well  see us hope he's  thinking like  well it's common sense  isn't it  I hope he's the  common sense  kind of guy  you just don't  succeed at the same  race  but the church  saw the movie  I guess  just to help  this along a little  bit  and now they're  okay with the movie 
[01:41:30]  there's no problem  I think it's fun  and look  hey you know  look  intrigues at the Vatican  even you know  violence  murders  assaults from the  outside  and within  you know  if you're at the  Vatican bookstore  what this one guy  pointed out to me  you can read all about it  I mean it's in their  history  I mean you know  it's an amazing  institution  they've done so much  good  but any institution  is going to  you know  occasionally be  compromised 
[01:42:00]  or you know  human beings  come into play  with all those  weaknesses  so they've had  all those kinds  of dramas  what Dan Brown  does  is he sort of  draws on  these possibilities  and then he  creates a work  of fiction  and you know  and that's what  Angels and Demons  is  and this  even more than  Da Vinci Code  is really about  the ride  that the audience  gets to go on  I think you'll  like it  I'm really excited  to start showing  it to audiences  what is it like  to not win an Oscar 
[01:42:30]  like when you're  nominated for something  and like you believe  in it  and it's like  you know that being  nominated is such an honor  but I always wonder  what are they  like what are you  thinking when you're  sitting there  and like they mention  the other name  it's like alright  you've been  but is it a tremendous  letdown or do you  kind of have a feeling  like I think they're  going to take it  well I've had  different experiences  with Apollo 13  which was sort of  neck and neck  with Braveheart  my favorite  by the way  Apollo 13  oh thank you  I was very proud of it  and we were nominated  for best picture  and we started winning  some of the awards 
[01:43:00]  leading up to it  and Brian Grazer  and I were sort of  sitting there  side by side  and we felt like  well this is it  and a lot of the pundits  had said we were  going to get it  and Braveheart won  and so for us  that was one of those  that was one of those  moments where  I said to Brian  well this is like  somebody kicked a field goal  to beat you  with one second  left in the game  and even though  I loved Braveheart  but I was very proud  of Apollo 13  we won with  Beautiful Mind  and that was thrilling  and with Frost Nixon  you know 
[01:43:30]  we were thrilled  to be nominated  we didn't  I don't think  Brian or I  either won  really expected to win  Slumdog Millionaire  it was a great movie  we loved it  it had a lot of momentum  and clearly  it was the favorite  and still  you're sitting there  and you just  you know  upsets happen  in those award shows  and it would be thrilling  to get to the microphone  and talk about your movie  and get an award  I guess it's easier  once you've won a couple too  like you know  that would be nice  number seven  it's probably a little easier  to follow  it's nice  when you're there 
[01:44:00]  you'd like to get it  let's be honest  is Clint in the new movie at all  no my dad is  oh he is  my dad is in it  and he plays  an American cardinal  the whole thing takes place  during Conclave  during that time  when they lock  all the cardinals in  and they're trying to vote  for a new pope  because it begins  our film begins  with the death of a pope  and you know  they never let cameras in there  but it's pretty well documented  and I took pains  to try to be  as authentic  and detailed about that  as the capsule 
[01:44:30]  going to the moon  but it was really interesting  anyway my dad got to play  you know  one of the American cardinals  there  and it was a great experience  was there a competition  between you and Clint  growing up  because he had  you know  Gentle Ben  his own  pretty much his own vehicle  you had  Andy Griffith's show  but you were kind of  you know  it was Andy's show  one time  one year  for one week  I think Andy Griffith  was first  and Gentle Ben  was second  in the ratings  and that was pretty great 
[01:45:00]  I remember  really appreciating that  that's amazing  but there's a five year spread  between us  and we've always been close  and you know  in all honesty  the business  has never gotten  in the way of that  and we don't talk  about it too much  but Clint's got a  you know  a great life  works all the time  I would just constantly  go to him  it's Tranya  great Star Trek episode  Jesus  he's  God I might get this wrong  but I think he's in 
[01:45:30]  an upcoming episode  of Fringe  where he plays  if you like that  oh really yeah  you might want to see  this episode of Fringe  because he's really  I know we're running  out of time  but Arrested Development  I've got to just mention  that's just an amazing show  thanks  it's an amazing show  that I discovered  when it came out on DVD  critics loved it  and then  for some reason  you know  sometimes  Ope said it before  or Greg  if I don't want to  confuse you  it's a little too weird  for me to be  sometimes the shows  are too smart  and too clever  for the majority  of the people 
[01:46:00]  watching television  I think  well it was also  kind of a  breakthrough  stylistically  in terms of  what a half hour  TV comedy  could look like  and sound like  yeah it looked  totally different  you know  now there's  now there's  The Office  and 30 Rock  I didn't even realize  that  it started with  Arrested Development  that's what I'm getting at  but Mitch Hurwitz  the creator of the show  is working on a screenplay  along with a guy  Jim Vallee 
[01:46:30]  and you know  Fox Searchlight  really wants to  make a movie of it  and so  I'm excited  because it's  another announcer gig  for me  yeah  you're not going to be  involved with the  creative process  though of the movie  well a little bit  but it really  that became  Mitch's baby  and you know  I mean  I was involved  early on with the show  creatively  and then soon  it just completely  you know  he really  owns it  he's a brilliant guy  he would also direct this 
[01:47:00]  and so  you know  he's writing  as we speak  I loved how it was  uncredited  narrator  it's like  if  everyone in the world  doesn't know  Ron Howard's voice  why would you be uncredited  why would you be uncredited  what is that  I don't know what that means  it was almost silly  for him to be credited  because  you knew  it was Ron Howard's voice  yeah  I don't mean to be naive  I mean  I'm an actor  it was sort of  it was sort of an accident  because in the beginning  I did the narration 
[01:47:30]  as just a temp  a temp thing  and  and we expected  to get somebody else  and  and then they liked  the narration  and it tested well  and Mitch liked it  and he asked  if I would do it  and  and I hadn't been credited  on the pilot  and  and then there was  a lot of people  sort of saying  is that Ron Howard's voice  is it not  so  we just thought  going into the new season  it'd be more interesting  to do it that way  and so we just  kept it that way  it's kind of a statement  how famous you are too  and how well known you are  you're like  no need for credit  it was a recognized 
[01:48:00]  Ron Howard's voice  can I  can I pitch a future project  for you Ron  sure  a documentary  on all the Opie's  out there  yeah  there must be some  hey do you know  where the name came from  by the way  no idea  I know where mine came from  it was  you  Andy  everybody always said  well is it short  for something  and he said no  when he was a kid  in North Carolina  and it was  before TV  there was radio  but they were in a small town  and the biggest thing 
[01:48:30]  that would happen is  once in a while  a circus would come through  or a carnival  but the other thing is  these traveling music shows  and there was a band leader  named Opie something  who had this  you know  this band  that he would come through  Andy loved music  would always see the show  and always remember that name  and so  when they were looking  for the name of a son  got a little knowledge  that's like finding out  something about your family tree  if there was some alcoholic  that would travel  playing an accordion  but you won't  you won't like  shave your head 
[01:49:00]  in sympathy with me  if you put me in it  I'll do whatever you want  I'll say goodbye  to these two guys  in a second  I gotta say  I met Ron  on the streets  I was never  I mean  we get starstruck  every once in a while  but I was out of my  freaking mind  and I don't know  if you remember  but then I ran home  to get a camera  I'm like  what am I doing  and my wife  she wasn't my wife  at the time  I'm like  I gotta go back  I gotta get a picture  and I never do that  well  I like bumping into you  did I tell you  what happened 
[01:49:30]  in that Starbucks  I was recognized  we were both  in the Starbucks  I know these guys  have heard the story  but I got  two big stars  no  I'm not even going there  I'm not even going there  but  I'm in the Starbucks  it's really early  and I get recognized  going  I can't believe  Opie  you're in the Starbucks  and I go  do you understand  how surreal this is  you're saying that  as the guy I'm named after  is right over there  putting whatever  he's putting in his coffee  and then I blew that guy  off to go talk to you  and then Ron blew you off  to go talk to you  of course he did  of course he did 
[01:50:00]  well whatever  it was one of those moments  I'll never forget  it was awesome  it was fun  I enjoyed it too  hey when you hear something  like the Christian Bale meltdown  which happens I'm sure  with actors  does stuff like that  kind of happen  maybe not to that level  but commonly on sets  where it just never gets recorded  or where people just  kind of freak out  each other a little bit  well that was pretty intense  my daughter Bryce  was in that scene  oh yeah  okay I forgot  and so I heard all about it  way before it ever broke  and it was  you know  it was uncomfortable for her  and she was surprised 
[01:50:30]  because that's not who he is  so clearly  he was in an intense scene  and when I heard  the circumstances  even from Bryce  of why he blew  frankly I understood it  because emotionally  you're doing something like that  and if you feel like  even somebody you respect  the cinematographer  is doing something  that's preventing you  from getting  from the moment  that you've kind of  been building your character to  you're going to lose your temper  now you know  he went overboard  and he regrets that  but you know 
[01:51:00]  so those kind of tirades  I probably haven't heard anything  that went on and on  and on like that before  but people blow up  all the time  it's you know  it's like probably  in a dugout  or in the locker room  it's very intense  you know  and people are giving  everything they've got  and let's face it  it's you know  it's not the kind of career  that draws people  who are you know  all  emotionally stable  emotionally stable  okay  Ron's got to go  we got to respect his time  I mean  this was great Ron  I appreciate it  love having you 
[01:51:30]  and best of luck  on the movie  Angels and Demons  it's in theaters  this Friday  but there are midnight screenings  starting tomorrow night  Thursday night at midnight  which is smart  and you'll obviously  have people at the midnight screenings  much anticipated sequel  and I'm sure it's going to succeed  cool  thanks a lot  the great Ron Howard  everyone  Opie and Anthony  wait a minute  I got to find out  Opie and Anthony  back live  star studded today  yes  first of all  I want to say  Ron Howard  how cool was he  he was great  he was amazing 
[01:52:00]  yeah  now that we broke the ice  I think he comes back  for every project he does  yes and he was  he knew a man like me  understood  oh when you said  I'm an actor  and of course  we got Dyson  get him involved  in the conversation  that was so ham handed  well yeah it was a joke  I'm an actor  no it was a  oh you are  because I'm casting  and you were perfect  that's what you were hoping  that's what Jimmy was hoping for  I was completely kidding  that Ron Howard would ask  you weren't hoping  that perhaps Ron Howard  would put you in a movie 
[01:52:30]  it wouldn't be feasible  so as she got involved  you could get involved  yeah maybe you could get involved  that's the intro  yeah  alright I'm on  no I gotta tell you something  you're not an actor  I am  I'm very good  let me tell you something  I got him on film  against Kenny's kid  Jeffrey doing the scene  and Jeff was right in the pocket  with his part  and he was baffling Norton  Jeff had an easier part though 
[01:53:00]  I had to do a whole bunch of stuff  no he didn't  I'm very good  very good  my part was to be baffled  he was all insecure about it  no that was the part  well yeah  while Jeffrey was threatening  my part was to be baffled  yes  wasn't the part  like he was telling you  what he was gonna do to you  like beating wise  I vaguely remember  but I'm so in the moment  with that stuff  he was doing that  where's Kenny  I'm living at  look at the big  fucking dinosaur  no but  no but  but Jeffrey  Kenny's son  has this whole monologue  he gives somebody  before he caves  their skull 
[01:53:30]  do you know the monologue  Kenny  remember the  the one that he did  to Norton on film  with the warning  he's picked it up  hello  he is a goon  Kenny is a goon  he just picks up  the entire mic stand  he's got a mic stand  I mean  hold on  I gotta be honest though  B  I gotta be honest  I mean I know Kenny  I don't know this man  that's Danny  and he's sitting behind me  and I don't trust anybody  behind me  unless I know him  yeah that's Danny  I'm not saying 
[01:54:00]  you're not a great guy  but now you know him  so now you can sit there  and I like the t-shirt  but can Kenny sit there  a minute  yes Kenny can sit there  yeah so why are you  having an attitude  about it  let the guy sit down  the minute you walk in  Stan he's a good friend  of mine  no but do you remember  you know the  the monologue right  the preamble to the beating  yeah  do you know it  no  no  what do you mean  you don't know it  I don't  we used to love that  I know  but that was what  the movie was about  like Norton was  come 
[01:54:30]  what  he's behind you  he's right there  he's still behind you  all right  look  turn around  we're gonna play  Jack off day here  Jack off day  I'm just telling you  I don't  I don't like that  kind of thing  I'm weird like that  Danny why don't you  stand here  so Danny can see you  at all times  Danny I'm sure  you're a nice guy  don't get me wrong  you know but I don't  know you  it's my drinking buddy  all right then  let him drink  in the corner  is that okay guys  I don't want to get  in a bad mood  I'm in a good mood  I see 
[01:55:00]  you know what I mean  so  I'm surprised  but you don't know  what does preamble  even mean  like to start  something  yes  yes so  so his part  to  you know  well yeah  I guess when you  think of actors  three names  roll off your tongue  De Niro  Pacino  Norton  I wouldn't put him  in that order  I'd put myself  in the mouth  no he is actually  a good actor  but not for  a guy like  who was in here  just now  Ron Howard 
[01:55:30]  yeah from  the thing  from the Hanks movie  I know him  Tom Hanks  yeah  Angels and Demons  Da Vinci Code  yeah  well that one  he didn't have to do  he should have  made that funnier  beautiful mind  funnier  yeah  no like I saw  the Da Vinci thing  yeah  and like I'm going  okay how long  has this got to be  to get the point across  it was like four hours  you know what the point  of the movie was  don't get me wrong  I'm a Hanks fan  yeah  you know I watch  Bosom Buddies  all the time  I'm into it  well I don't know  if I want you to 
[01:56:00]  bring that one up  that was a big thing  he was also in taxi  if he didn't do that  yeah  if he didn't do that  he wouldn't be doing  but what happened  to the other guy  from Bosom Buddies  his buddy  see  doesn't always work out  he left him  in the dust  he fucking did  you know what  that guy's like  that guy's like  the Pete Best  of sitcoms  right yeah  who is that guy  I don't even know his name  he was like  the first drummer  of the Beatles  that's still walking around  going why  I was with  Tom's not accepting  my calls 
[01:56:30]  what happened  that's messed up  you think he calls them  remember when we were  I'm doing a new movie  sorry I can't  yeah and they were  in a show called  Bosom Buddies  you would think  they would keep in touch  after all these  I guess they weren't  Da Vinci Code  Dice you said  what was the point  of Da Vinci Code  I didn't know  so I shut it off  you never got to the end  never  it's just so  fucking slow moving  you wanted more laughs  yeah like when  he did  like wait  when Hanks did 
[01:57:00]  like the retard role  the gum thing  funny  oh Forrest Gump  funny  no no  that's what he's good at  you know what I mean  he's a great  comedic act  no he wasn't  well that's what he was playing  he was playing  a version of a Todd  you know what I mean  he was like  you know  slow  not profoundly  non-functional Todd  because that wouldn't even  be fun to watch  not the walking  at the walls  you know  none of that  you can't do anything  with that  yeah 
[01:57:30]  no  I don't know  what they call  the kind  you know what  I'll use the  what's  E-Rock  what would be  like the term  for  just a slow guy  slow guy  waterhead  no  I'm a fan  of the waterhead  no I'm saying  what Tom Hanks  did in Gump  I mean it was  phenomenal  and he knew  the kind of  asshole things  he was doing  like when he would  play the paddle ball  he was really 
[01:58:00]  being an asshole  about it  and he knew  how ridiculous  that was  because  even being  kind of a retard  yeah  and just everything  happening great  for him  you know  but the ping pong  shit  hysterical  what about when  he made  cumsies in his  pants  when the girl  leaned over  and touched him  I think I ruined  your robe  I think I ruined  your robe  he touched  her tit  and he goes  oh  oh  it came in his  pants  funny  because Hanks  knows how  ridiculous  let's not go  to the filth 
[01:58:30]  let's keep this  a little PG  is this bizarro  dice  what happened  I don't know  what happened  you know what I mean  we're having a conversation  but what I'm saying  is I like  Hanks and Rolls  I mean  Gump had a  serious overtone  yeah  but yet  it's one of the  funniest films  ever made  by the way  you just heard  that  other than what about  Bob  from the guy  that came up  with Hickory Dickory  Doc  this chick  was sucking  my cock  so  alright  we'll keep it  clean  why Hanks  don't do that  I know  I was just saying  but keep it  clean  came from the  guy 
[01:59:00]  her uterus  fell out  yeah  I did  just talking  about  I don't want  to get filthy  or anything  of course not  you're dice  but I saw  this chick  going into  I'm telling you  with the shorts  because she knows  it's going to  I would fuck her  till her pussy  melted  I was in the  car with the  two guys  and I'm going  look at that  fucking meat  pocket  between her legs  this little  fucking slob 
[01:59:30]  willing to take  the cold weather  on knowing  it's going to  get hot  yeah yeah  just to wear  that  I would just  keep fucking  slapping my  fucking sack  against that  fucking meat  pocket  till it just  either fucking  melted from  the heat  or exploded  they explode  I didn't know  they had the  potential to  explode  if you  yeah  I've gone  through it  all  yeah  the other  night  I fucked  this one  chick  her asshole  popped up  you ever do 
[02:00:00]  that  you're pink  sock there  you know  they're nuts  today  I'm not alone  here  no no  it's the truth  these chicks  go fucking  wild  god forbid  you don't  dislocate a  shoulder  they don't  moan  you know  what I mean  I hear you  dice  yeah  and then  in the middle  of it  I mean  you're going  fucking  nuts  right  you're just  fucking  clobbering  her with  your cock  and all  of a sudden  she goes  um  I have  to cut 
[02:00:30]  the  bathroom  on me  I mean  this is what  goes on  today  yeah  you know  what I'm  talking about  it's a different  world out there  what do you  do  how do you  even send  a little  love note  this isn't  even material  because  you know  I've been  stuck in a  hotel room  you know  what I mean  and you know  you try to  make believe  you're not  going to watch  adult films  you know  like you go  oh what's  this  the menu  oh we're

[02:03:00]  well not me  David why did  you decide that  Ron Howard should  be on the show  before Andrew  Dice Clay  why did I  decide that  yeah he's right  here tell him  to his face  I like how you  repeat the  question like  you're being  like that's  good  thank you  that's what you're  doing interviews  it certainly is  yes  go ahead  tell him  I decided that  because uh  Ron Howard  you're a big  because you  Opie are a big  fan of uh  Ron Howard  I'm just named 
[02:03:30]  after the guy  actually I do  like his work  I know you're  just named after  him but it was  important to you  to meet him  and I'm not  saying I'm not  trying to be rude  to Dice but  he's been on the  show numerous  times and you  know him  no you didn't  no you didn't  so I thought  it would be  important for you  guys  what's your name  again  I'm David  by the way it  doesn't look like  this every day  Dice we try to  do a little  makeover  say what you  said it's okay  you'll feel  better  that's what I  was saying  yeah  go ahead  say what  you're feeling  don't be 
[02:04:00]  holding back  on  yeah you'll  hold him  back a little  no not  holding back  no I'm not  alright what  was it again  I just said  it  you really  think what  no I  what  see he's  all flustered  for the most  time  what I said  was that  I thought  because Ron  Howard was a  very important  interview and  that you  wanted to  and Dice  isn't important  no I didn't say  he's not  important  no  he's not  important  I said  he's less  I meant  he's less  Ron Howard's  more important  because he's  oh you're 
[02:04:30]  saying that  he's more  important  you know what  I would have  to agree with  that on a  certain level  ah  okay  I mean  look at the  films the man  does  yeah  that's true  Mission Impossible  yeah  Apollo 13  when they  landed on the  moon  they never  landed  no  in the film  world 
[02:05:00]  things like  what about  Ford Fairlane  what about  Ford Fairlane  that wasn't him  he wasn't him  who did that  one  he had his  hands in  everything  you said  though  maybe he  did  you never  know  what  me  no  I don't  know  what that  is  no  good movie  I'll rent  it  yeah  rent it  okay  yeah  you'd like  that  what do you want  a picture of  I don't know  like the whole  thing  the whole  thing  okay 
[02:05:30]  your camera  looks really  old  no  it's amazing  this camera  all right  it had kind  of like a  zoom  is that good  yeah it looks  really good  does it look  good  how many  megapixels  eight  megapixels  eight  right now  we're just  taking pictures  yeah  no no no  now what  happens  oh the  graves  but David  why are you  being disrespectful  to Dyson  I mean you  know he's  a friend  and he's  been a friend  for many  years  you're saying  one guest  is more  important 
[02:06:00]  all of our  guests are  of equal  importance  some of  them do  different  things  no Ron  Howard's  behind the  scenes  but no more  important than  you is what  I'm saying  you guys  are two  different  things  but as far  as guests  go you're  all important  stop with the  fucking stupid  smile David  Jesus  is that it  David  because we're  in the middle  of our great  interview with  Andrew  by the way  Dice if you  didn't know  I just want to  inform you  David is of  the Jewish  persuasion  yes  I don't know  if you can  tell just  by looking  at him 
[02:06:30]  is he  yeah  say something  hi Dice  let me put  this down  so I can  go back  and do  let's see  this  he's videotaping  with his  camera  his camera  technology  he said that  he agreed  he said he  agreed  he's being  nice  you kind of  insulted him  and I think  you owe him  an apology  he really  didn't  a little bit  a little bit  a little bit  a little bit  you want to  know the truth  a little bit 
[02:07:00]  he's a young  guy  he's a  he's a  Ron Howard  fan  obviously  and  in a lot  of ways  we need a guy  like Ron Howard  well of course  we do  you know what I mean  it's an institution  yeah I mean  Ron knows  you don't put  a guy like Ron  in front of the camera  so you give him  because he's had  a tremendous history  doing like  why don't you put  a guy like Ron  Howard in front  of the camera  well you know  he did all that  he did happy days 
[02:07:30]  he got to play  the son  Mayberry  and Fonzie's friend  yeah  and yeah  all the way back  to his childhood  and here's a guy  you know  you know  he ain't George Clooney  you know what I mean  you know  I mean  if Ron Howard  starred in  Benjamin Pitt  people would be  running from the theater  Benjamin Pitt  yeah whatever that  Benjamin Pitt  remember that  no  what is it David  Benjamin Button  oh Benjamin  it's Benjamin Pitt 
[02:08:00]  from now on  yeah yeah  of course it is  I understood  what he was saying  the stupidest movie  I ever saw  another great comedy  way overrated  yeah funny  hysterical  you see  stupidly overrated  that movie  you see Benjamin  who's playing Pitt  in the movie  yeah  start out like  like a little monster baby  like E.T.  yeah  and you know  he's getting  but he's like  210 years old  he's getting younger  and younger  and then he falls  for this chick 
[02:08:30]  uh oh  right  and now  he gets like  better  now all of a sudden  you see him on a sailboat  and it should have  just said at that moment  Pitt  you know what I mean  with the hand  holding the sail  and now he gets into it  with this chick  cause she was a baby  growing up  and he was  an old man  getting younger  so now it gets  to that level  uh oh  you know what I mean  where you know  he could crack it open  for her  you know what I mean  right  you know  and he puts it in 
[02:09:00]  crack it open  yeah you know what I mean  of course I do  it's like he fucking  breaks in there a little  right  yeah yeah  and he becomes a husband  and then it gets to the point  cause he's getting younger  that he goes you know  I'm getting too young for you  cause she's feeling  well am I too old for you  yeah  you know  and he's going  well yeah kind of  and I'm going  what the fuck  most guys like older chicks  really  yeah  the experience  yeah  fuck the experience  I brought out a ass  like a snare drum  than fucking experience 
[02:09:30]  no but when a guy's younger  he likes an older chick  and then you get older  you're like the younger  that's how it works  so anyway  so Pitt's getting too young  and he takes off  on the motorcycle  right  all of a sudden  he shows up again  I guess he traveled  all of and he's thinking  about this chick's box  uh oh  right  he comes back  and she's married  to some other fucking guy  right  cause you know them  god forbid  they don't have a cock  wrapped around  their fucking neck  every day of the week  these little fucking 
[02:10:00]  slobs right  of course  god forbid  they're not gagging  shut the fuck up  already  and swallow it  they look like  they got rabies  these chicks  when they blow you today  anyway  yeah with the foam  falling out of  these motherfuckers  I love them  god bless  you know like all the drool  and the foam  these days  so anyway  so now he comes back  and she's like  well you know  you can stay with me  you know  so now he moves in 
[02:10:30]  with the chick  and now it cuts  to like a scene  where he's like  like 10  you know  and she's like  the mommy now  oh wow  you know what I mean  and she don't even  do nothing for him  anymore  it's not like he forgot  that she was  whacking his bag  right right  it's not that he forgot  she was sucking  on his fucking dick  alright  he's a kid  but he still has needs  he remembers  go in his room  at night  fucking  you know  he still has the memories  yeah  exactly  experience  and age 
[02:11:00]  he should be doing  movie reviews  well this is what I'm saying  dice his movie reviews  go in his room  whack his bag  under the blanket  do something nice  this is your child  you know what I mean  so you're gonna get  mad at him  cause he's now  too young for you  and then at the end  of the fucking movie  I'm laughing hysterical  and this guy's yelling  at me in the theater  and I'm going  do me a favor  just look the other way  you know this is a  fucking goof  this movie  you know  everybody  you know  with the turnaround  when they give you  the look  like they're gonna 
[02:11:30]  kill you  but it's never  happened ever  nobody ever  really gets up  you know  they try to kill it  with a look  like you know  like don't enjoy  the movie  and now she's  holding Pitt  supposedly  he's like  a little baby  in a blanket  now  and going  you know  at least  powder's balls  with some powder  and she wouldn't  even fucking  do that  and that's why  he goes and dies  he's got no reason  to live no more  yeah  it's like  after all that 
[02:12:00]  he just  what  shrivels up  as a baby  and that's it  it's the funniest  fucking movie  of the year  it's ridiculous  it is the funniest movie  and I would have to say  the guy that wrote it  is one of the most  demented minds  in Hollywood  you know  I don't give a fuck  who he is  what he's done  they go  oh  what great directing  this guy's a sick fuck  and you'd have people  watching him  yeah  with that kind of mindset  oh you think  maybe he's got  issues  he's behind you still 
[02:12:30]  I thought you didn't  like people behind him  David  didn't you hear  when he did this to Danny  he doesn't like people  behind him  no no  move a little over  alright  move over  can you teach him  something nice  look at him  he's a little  there you go  do you like working  on the ONA show  sure I do  I like it all  what's your job exactly  intern  did you see  Benjamin Pitt  no I haven't seen it yet  nope  did you see  the Da Vinci Code  yes I saw that one  and what'd you think  very good movie  Da Vinci Code 
[02:13:00]  I enjoyed it  very good  it's not funny  no it's not a funny  movie at all  no  I walked out  I like when  Hanks is funny  oh yeah  even when he  was riddled with AIDS  in that movie  oh Philadelphia  yeah  he still gave it  that comedic edge  like remember the part  all kidding aside  when he's walking  around near the end  with like  you know  he's like  in his bathrobe  holding like  intravenous  or whatever  they're feeding into  and he's playing it 
[02:13:30]  with the face  he's making that  fucking  you know  that drone  fucking look  he knows what he's doing  he's making a great point  I hate to say  we're getting a lot of laughs  and that was another  Academy Award  wait Opie  did he get the Academy Award  for what  did he get the Academy Award  for gum  I don't know  did he  yes  did he get the Academy Award  for Da Vinci  no  do you know why  because it's not  fucking funny  I try to help  this guy  God forbid he calls me 
[02:14:00]  he's trying to make  that serious thing  but he is  he's giving it  that little  little like  comedic edge  because he loves  idiocy  he likes  remember when he did  Bachelor Party  yeah  I saw that  56 times  hysterical  the mule  then there was one  the Volcano  Joe vs. the Volcano  how funny is that  plus he gets to look up  that  Meg Ryan  Meg Ryan  look up  I'm scared  and then Money Pit  Money Pit  hysterical  when he screams

[02:16:00]  where were we  believe it  fucking ridiculous  he just wrecked your flow  I'm thinking  he did  you're right David  you want to have him do push-ups  or some dice  with those arms  you should do 10 push-ups  as punishment  because you wrecked his flow  he's all about the flow  yeah we went to a whole thing  who were you even talking about  see you don't even remember  Eddie Munster  the guy that played  Eddie Munster  that was it  Tom Hanks  Eddie Munster  yeah remember him  yeah he played  Eddie Munster  what  I thought that was  on the Munsters  yeah yeah yeah  remember them 
[02:16:30]  yeah  that was funny  it was Butch Patrick  Butch Patrick  no it was Tom Hanks  no he changed his name  came out with the big back  once he got into  bosom buddy  yeah it was Tom Hanks  why would he change his name  and not just go with  the original name  which already made him famous  because who wants to be called  Butch your whole life  hey Butch  that's right  Butch gets smacked  right yeah  you know what I mean  you give him a smack  what do you like about  the Munsters dice  um  Morticia  Morticia  yeah  Morticia was in the Adams family  yeah  you're getting  the two Munsters  yeah yeah  Lily  didn't they mix them 
[02:17:00]  Lily was the  no never the  Kenny was in the Munsters  didn't the Munsters  have the blonde girl  yeah who they thought  was ugly  but she was really hot  because she was really hot  but they didn't  they didn't cast that right  because she wasn't hot  either way  she was supposed to be hot  back then  when like a fat ass  and uh  that Marilyn Monroe  kind of look  was supposed to be hot  she was alright  she was  she looked uh  fucking like a spinster  yeah  but then the guys  would come over the house  to be there  and pick her up  and then they'd run  through the door  because they'd see Herman  and leave the silhouette 
[02:17:30]  of themselves  busted through the door  would they live next door  to them like  no  what's in the Adams family  the Munsters were on  1313 Mockingbird Lane  and where was the Adams family  and the Adams family  lived on um  yeah but it might have been  like Kitty  it might have been Kitty Corner  where there's still neighbors  but different street addresses  that's true  I never thought of that  I think Dice might be on  or something  yeah  shoot  what happened  what  what  what are you doing  I'm just thinking  just enjoy  just enjoy  I didn't  I didn't get to say  the smack thing  I know  what 
[02:18:00]  oh I know  yeah  what  what happened  I didn't do anything  what  what's going on  Trump  were you on the three hour finale  because like I told you  I was only on for a few seconds  because you were out  I gave up on the show  I didn't watch it  yeah no but  I did the finale  and uh  there was no call for that  you know what I mean  what happened  he was threatening  well he  no Donnie was  Donnie was cool  he said  yeah  he said to me  I saw him in LA  and he said that he was  going to threaten  Trump with a slap  nice  no I'm saying  if he said something 
[02:18:30]  I'd give him a smack  but you didn't smack  no but he was cool  no smack  you know what I mean  so it was nice  and it was a great episode  Tom Green was great on it  why did  why did they get rid of you though  that wasn't a mistake  what did you do  that they got rid of you  they did  they did the right thing  what  the right thing  what did you do  that they got rid of you  nothing  that's why  oh literally  nothing  you know what  you didn't want to cook  you didn't want to cook  you know what it is  I figured  like when they give you  like a task  like another TV 
[02:19:00]  like if it's a sitcom  or something  alright  they bring you in  they make believe  this is what you're going to do  and then the chick  bakes for two days  and then we sell it  you know  they're showing us  this stuff  they take us into  like a cutlery place  and uh  and then they say  alright let's go to work  and I'm like  what are you kidding  I gotta stay here  for this now  like for eight hours  I can't do that  I got no patience for that  no  yeah so I wouldn't do it  you know  that's not my thing 
[02:19:30]  like even when she was  explaining how you make  the fucking things  I'm like not listening  cause I'm figuring  she's gonna do it anyway  you know what I mean  I'm a guy  I think what he's getting at  is like  and if Donnie  would've used his fucking brain  you don't give a task  like that  you go like this  alright  work in a gas station  pump gas  clean people's windshield  something that I don't look  like a jerk off  in front of my friend  you're baking cookies  that looks silly for you  it's stupid  it's not a dice thing  you know what I mean  so when I was fired  I sort of appreciated it  yeah  yeah but they should've 
[02:20:00]  kept you around  for the good TV  well yeah  they had a lot of  they had a lot of  dullards  they kept around  yeah no  I mean let's admit  you know  it's star power  and  that would've been the thing  yeah that's the thing  I mean I know how to  make something entertaining  that would've been the thing  but he even admitted that  you know  he shouldn't have got rid of me  and you know  did he say that  yeah  yeah it was a mistake  yeah it was a mistake  it's still a ratings based  TV show  you want people to watch it  and enjoy it  yes  kids if he doesn't want to bake  fucking cookies  you keep them there  you don't have a guy like me do that 
[02:20:30]  you're the loose cannon  that's right  a guy like me  a show needs a loose cannon  thrills America  you know  let Brian McKnight bake  you know what I mean  let Clint Black bake  in between sessions of therapy  what a bore  you can just walk around  and go  you know what I mean  what are you baking  Clint Black  all he wanted to do  he only wanted to  like heckle with me  this asshole  you know  and I like  warned them  before the show  how good of a heckler  could Clint Black be  you know what I love  guys that think  they're clever and fast 
[02:21:00]  you know  so I just told them  I said  is that what you want to do today  yeah  do you want to  you know  I said go ahead  if you really want to be in therapy  go ahead  it's like the kid  that comes into town  looking for the gunslinger dice  that's it  you know  where do they end up  on the fucking ground  with a bullet in the face  don't bring your guns to town  just say when  Clint Black  just say fucking when  wants to fucking  spar with the dice man  you know  what I want to play  I don't know if we can  yeah I'll play whatever  fuck  no but  throw it at me  obviously  now that we're all family again 
[02:21:30]  of course  I can involve my  you know my kid  Norton knows my kids  they're doing LA Rocks  that's their band  and he came over  for Pesach  yep  you're from Pesach  Norton told me the story  you went to Dices  for a religious holiday  I could not have  the casulta fish  I gotta jump in Dice  because it'll help  by the way  we're sharing a cab  Norton's going  I went out to LA  I saw Dice  and all of a sudden  we hear this music  coming from another room  and it was really good  you didn't know  it was his son at first 
[02:22:00]  I didn't know  that they were actually  playing live  because we were in  the other room  and we came in  and it was the two boys  playing  and it's like  it's weird  it's Max and Dylan  you know Dylan too  yeah of course  he was a little  little thing  when we met him  but  it's weird  right Dylan's the little  younger one  I gotta show him  before we play  when it's your friend's  kids it's different  because you're like  what if they're not good  you wanna be polite  but they were really  and I'm being really honest  they were really good  that's what I wanted  to tell Dice  that's exactly  what he said  in the cab  and then he goes  it was so good  that everybody 
[02:22:30]  wanted to hear  another song  yeah it wasn't  a polite request  either  it was like  it was surprisingly  so I told them  maybe  you know  the guys  will play a cut  from  let's play it  alright so  they told me  if you play a cut  to play track 3  now let me just explain  Dylan's 14  plays guitar  sings  and writes all the music  14  yeah he's only 14  Jesus  ok  and Max is 18  and he's on drums  that's the whole band  ok  so 
[02:23:00]  how is Max 18 already  that's fucked up  Jesus Christ  so who's playing  all the other instruments  then  they're just  they're on  so wait  it's a drummer  and  drummer and a guitarist  and a vocal  I got you  ok  yeah so  Dylan White Stripe  writes the song  he's singing  and playing  yeah  so  what they're hearing  is really kids  and uh  so I hand this to you  so track 3  is what you wanna play  cause that's what  they requested  what's the name  of track 3  Junkyard  Junkyard  ok  and he writes  the words  what's the name  of their band 
[02:23:30]  LA Rocks  and they'll actually  be with me  at the Canyon Club  in LA  in a few weeks  oh  here it is  3  4  looking at your pastime  looking at your pastime 
[02:24:00]  rusted and he came  barking from the guy down  makes you go insane  if you picked up a strap 
[02:24:30]  wouldn't make you choke  down in the junkyard  where the dead things lay  down in the junkyard  where the dead things stay  here at the playground  here at the playground  you could never escape  this is your final day  oh yeah  oh yeah  soaking in the carnage 
[02:25:00]  breathing in the smoke  looking at destruction  looking at destruction  like it's one big fucking joke  if you picked up a scrap 
[02:25:30]  if you picked up a scrap  wouldn't make you choke  down in the junkyard  where the dead things lay  down in the junkyard  where the dead things stay  here at the playground  you could never escape  this is your final day  symphony 
[02:26:00]  bye  bye  bye  bye  bye  bye  We'll be right back. 
[02:26:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:27:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:27:30]  Let me start.  I thought we were going to have to be nice.  I'll be completely honest. 
[02:28:00]  Like, oh, that's kind of cute.  Your sons have a band.  That's fucking amazing.  The kid's 14?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got a good voice, man.  I really thought, all right, we'll play a little bit of it.  We'll somehow get out of it and get back to the Tom Hanks theory.  Dude, what the fuck?  Well, that's why I told him.  And our...  But I knew you would appreciate it.  Well, there's Alice in Chains in there, which, I mean, as an influence, I appreciate.  But there's...  There's a feedback, you know our listeners.  They're a bunch of cocksuckers.  Well, that's what...  Even the kids were going, but I got to tell you this thing. 
[02:28:30]  But no, they're all like, holy shit, where can I hear more?  Well, you know, we're recording this album, you know what I mean?  But what's amazing is when...  If I play a track for somebody, normally I don't say it's my kids or anything.  Right, right.  Because they're so young.  I go, what do you think of this band I'm producing?  You know, and they listen, they give their opinion.  And then I go, these are the kids.  I show them the phone, they go, that's who's doing this?  You know, because the lyrics are really intense also.  Absolutely.  You know, and, you know, like I said, they start doing their own shows out in L.A. 
[02:29:00]  And now they're opening for me, too, a little.  Well, and, yeah, the response is amazing because there's only two of them.  Yeah.  You know.  Dylan's 14 on the lead vocals and the lead guitar.  Yeah.  And writing the shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like it.  And Mac's obviously doing a great job with the drums.  I like his voice a lot.  That is...  Absolutely.  Yeah, when he goes into that higher register and gets that grit on there at 14, how do  you do that?  Is his voice still going to change a little bit?  I sound like a fucking girl.  It's just amazing.  You know, I'm just happy.  Is his voice still changing, though? 
[02:29:30]  You know what?  Right now, it's the way it is.  You know, so, you know, I think it'll only get better.  I think it'll only get better now that he's doing it.  Wow.  14, you're probably not going to change it where it's going to affect it negatively.  I mean, he's only playing guitar three years, you know.  And, you know, you can remember when Max got into the drums, doing play the little drums,  play the little piano.  And then he found the guitar.  And, you know, Slash is a huge influence on him.  And, you know...  As his slash comes over? 
[02:30:00]  No, you know who came over, gave him, like, a five-hour lesson, was the guy on the new  axle at Ron Bumblefoot.  You know, Don Jameson.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like a gift, you know.  And Bumblefoot was blown away.  Yeah.  You know, and it's just fun for me, because it's like they're doing their own thing.  More than fun.  They got something.  It's obvious.  All the tracks are great.  I just...  They asked me to play that one.  Oh, my God.  Great reviews from us, and definitely the listeners. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, the fans are digging it.  It's amazing to get good reviews on anything from the fans.  You know, my kids are smart enough to go, you know what?  No matter what, Dad, don't take calls, because you know how people just call up just to say  you suck, even if you don't, you know.  Honestly, kid sounds really good.  Sounds like Silverchair when they first got started were good.  That fucking rock.  Rocked kids have a lot of talent.  Make them come to New York.  I'd go see them.  Where can I hear more?  Yeah, they might do Atlantic City with me when I do that.  That's a big voice for a 14-year-old.  Dice is going to be like a fucking stage mother running around. 
[02:31:00]  You know what it is?  I'll just tell you.  Tina!  Get the axe!  This is like the type of thing where it's their thing, but I get excited about it.  Sure.  So I just sort of want to keep them grounded, because...  Oh, they could lose control real quick.  Well, no, but...  The chicks.  But I explain, you know, that's why I don't understand, like, different families, showbiz  families that have had kids that have made it, and, you know, for the rest of their life,  they chased the fame they had when they were 15.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:31:30]  You know, like, asshole families that go, you know what?  This might not last.  Like, you could put out an album and do five million copies, and then you're over.  Yeah.  Or else you could continue and be, you know,  or Paul McCartney for years, or Billy Joel, but you've got to prepare kids to go, look,  this might just be a great moment in your life, you know, but you've got to stay grounded.  You know, it's a whole thing.  That's why, you know, I worry about it, because look what happened to me, and I made it when  I was 30.  You know, and it's overwhelming.  But they got their own sound. 
[02:32:00]  I mean, it definitely fits into a style, but yeah, no, I know, but I just don't like some  music part of it.  No, every song is a different type of music.  There's one on there that's like punk, you know, and you want to hear a quick track?  I don't care.  Do the one that says Blitz.  I think it's the first one.  Blitz, all right.  And he's singing about when he was two.  Well, you know what?  It's just how do you fucking think about when you're two?  No, you'll hear what he's singing, though.  But being, you know, the son of dice, I mean, you got some stuff to write about. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, no.  Yeah, well, we won't play Outlaw.  Here's Blitz.  Blitz, back in 1996, I was two years old.  Who would ever know that today I'd be conquering the world? 
[02:33:00]  Stand around the fire like red so I can't stop, hold me back.  I spit in the face of anyone who ever told me that I can. 
[02:33:30]  Spend all my time in my area where I made my plan.  Stand around the fire like red so I can't stop, hold me back.  Get off your software like red so I can't stop, hold me back. 
[02:34:00]  Come on and join me, you don't have a chance anyway  I'm running for my future and I know I'll catch up someday 
[02:34:30]  Stand around the fire, I agree  Stand around the fire, I agree  Stand around the fire  So I can't stop, hold me back  Bitch! 
[02:35:00]  Jesus.  Great, dude.  People saying that song's better than the first one.  Really?  No joke.  Release date, first one really good, this one's awesome.  Those vocals are fucking phenomenal, reminds me a bit of the guy from Lost Profits.  I'm 31, this is Jersey Matt, and I'm jealous of a 14-year-old.  Thanks guys.  Dice's kids fucking rock.  Bliss is great.  Some social distortion in there.  You know, it was funny, you know, Eleanor, she went to see him at the cat club with some of her girlfriends, and the girlfriend, I won't say the name, is standing with Eleanor going, I can't believe I'm getting hot for a 14-year-old. 
[02:35:30]  You know, and she's going, at least the other one's 18 and he's legal, you know, I mean, and Max, I mean, it's amazing.  The kid is 14, I gotta keep stressing that.  He's 14, Max is 18.  The smart ones know how to fucking pick up a guitar.  That's it.  The smart fucking kids know how to pick up a guitar because then you're set, at least as far as girls go.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  If you want to work forever, you pick up a bass.  If you want to work until you're 75, because bands always need a bass player.  Yeah, yeah.  Always.  But if you want to get laid, you pick up a guitar.  Exactly.  Are they going to keep the name L.A. Rocks?  Yeah.  Yeah, they love that name.  Yeah.  It's where they, you know, it's where they live.  And are they getting a little attention out in L.A.?  I mean, where are we at with this?  Well, no, what's happening now is now people, like record people are calling me about meetings with them.  Yeah, that's this one promoter that does Aerosmith's albums.  And when he heard, like, number one, you know, if I told you they were 30 years old, well, by then you're either great or you're not. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  When you hear, wait, a 14-year-old's writing these lyrics, you know, and writing this music, he goes, I want to produce them.  Mm-hmm.  You know, but I'm just trying to pace it a little.  You got to try to figure it out, where to go.  Yeah.  It's got to be a tough thing to do.  Yeah.  It's got to be the right record company, the right producer.  You know what I mean?  And, you know, it's exciting.  I'm more excited about that than the shit I'm doing. 
[02:37:00]  You know, like, when they'll go on stage in front of me, I'm like, I sweat right through my clothes.  Right.  Because, you know, you picture, like, at the Cat Club, you know, I saw the tape of it, you know, and three sticks when flying.  You know, because you sweat a lot.  So, you know, and he just picks up another one and keeps going.  Mm-hmm.  You know, and, you know, but you panic if a string is going to break, you know.  I'm not even thinking of my own set.  But live, Dylan's got the confidence to just stand up there and help it out.  Let me tell you, a friend of mine, a comic, goes like this to me. 
[02:37:30]  He goes, so I got to see them, and it almost looked like an inconvenience for him.  He's like James Dean up there.  Like, you know, he's, like, brooding, you know, but his hands are just flying up and down the neck of the guitar.  You know, but that's his attitude towards things, you know.  That's why these songs have.  What do you think?  What do you think, Ant?  I like it.  Yeah.  The fucking vocals are amazing.  14.  Jesus Christ.  Do they have a website? 
[02:38:00]  I mean, where would.  Yeah, you could go to L.A. Rocks, I guess.  What?  On MySpace.  They have a MySpace.  Oh, okay.  All right.  The official L.A. Rocks site.  Okay.  Yeah, they'll find it.  And what music did he listen to growing up?  Because you're.  They love Led Zeppelin.  Yeah, but you're, like, more of a.  I don't know.  What do you listen to?  Elvis Sammy.  Yeah, Elvis.  That's right.  Yeah, but I love, you know, rock bands, too.  Led Zeppelin, Guns N' Roses, obviously, you know. 
[02:38:30]  But this is what they listened to.  You know, they loved everything.  You know, they listened to everything from Jim Morrison to Led Zeppelin to Metallica to.  You know, Velvet Revolver.  Velvet Revolver is nice.  Actually, Sully from Godsmack came over to me, the drummer, the other night.  I saw him in L.A.  He was more than the drummer.  He's there.  He's everything.  I know, but I just look at him like a drummer.  I don't know.  You know, because that's what I play, and that's what Max, so.  He's an amazing drummer that got bored with the drumming thing and decided to, you know. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, but he used to call me when Max was 10 and already doing the double bass drum  and sit on the phone and listen to him and give me advice and talk to Max on the phone,  but he never saw him live.  I said, well, you've got to see what they're doing now, you know.  But, yeah, they love all those kind of bands.  White Stripes, any of that?  Yeah, they love White Stripes, but, you know, like when they talk about, like, they understand,  like, bands like the Jonas Brothers.  They get it, you know.  Why do they get that? 
[02:39:30]  No, because, but they get, like, the industry, like, creating this stuff.  But he probably looks at that and goes, that's a joke.  No, they love hard-hitting, like, two-fisted rock and roll.  Because the Jonas Brothers are a joke.  Well, you know what's funny?  Like, you know, he would write things a few years ago, Dylan, like how he's going to bring  rock to where it should be again.  Jesus.  You know, like Led Zeppelin type of rock and roll.  Dude, you might be raising the next, like, Kurt Cobain or something or John Lennon or whoever  you want to use. 
[02:40:00]  Uh-huh.  I'm serious.  No, but you know what?  This is, you know, maybe.  You just might be.  I could work for them a little, maybe.  Yeah, maybe you get to rest a little bit, right?  Yeah, I can't, I can't deal with the traveling no more.  So let them do it.  How funny would it be if they start saying, Dad, maybe you shouldn't come on this trip.  That'll happen at some point.  I believe it'll happen.  It's happening already.  Like, they were happy I wasn't in town for the cat club.  Oh, right.  And all they're thinking, and this is what's crazy, you know the chicks that are going  to come see us?  That's all they're thinking. 
[02:40:30]  Of course.  But that's what rock and roll is.  Thank God, though, right?  Nice.  You know, but I always told them.  Because, you know, the alternative would have been, you know, interior decorating and going,  oh, could you imagine who's coming over?  No, they don't want to decorate.  I'm saying thank God that the chicks.  They're saying chicks.  He's saying thank God they're the chicks.  You understand what I mean?  Thank God, you know, they're saying, hey, the chicks that'll be there.  Oh, you mean fair.  Instead of being fair.  Hey, rugged, what's next?  I don't want to be blunt.  You know?  Oh, no, gays, whatever you call them today. 
[02:41:00]  Figs.  That was good.  Figs.  I'm not making fun.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, no, they did the chick thing.  Heads I want, hair pie, tails I want.  Balls across the nose.  Oh!  Yeah, hey.  I hear you.  Yeah, hey.  I hear you.  Yeah, hey.  I hear you.  It's like watching Martin and Lewis together again.  It's like going back to Homecoming.  Jesus.  You know, Kenny, you know, they know him since, you know, kids.  Yeah. 
[02:41:30]  What about the drugs, though?  That's got to worry you.  No, it doesn't.  Rocks, chicks, drugs.  No, let me tell you.  Just saying.  I'm drilling.  Throw it on the table.  Let me tell you something.  How do you handle that?  They're just not about that.  It's not, you know, because of me, they can talk to me about everything.  You know, they talk to me everything from alcohol to drugs to box, you know.  You know, it's not like, and that's what they do love about me, that they know they could come to me with anything.  I mean, Dylan, you know, my youngest son, stopped being friends with certain kids because they got into drugs. 
[02:42:00]  You know, he's just not about that.  But, you know, he's more into about the accomplishment of doing something special.  I say we get behind this and, like, make L.A. Rocks, like, huge.  You're not going to take the seating and throw it out the window like you did at Godsmack?  But what I love about them is that they're focused.  He makes a really good point.  What?  Me and Ant, we're hanging with Sully.  We go way back with Sully before he was Godsmack, and he gave us his demo like you just gave over the L.A. Rocks. 
[02:42:30]  And I've told Sully this a million times.  I'm a huge Godsmack fan now and always will be.  But we got so many demos from bands, I couldn't take it.  So on the way home, I threw his demo out into the window.  There's nothing more fun than throwing a demo out the window.  It's hysterical, but it was Godsmack.  And he landed in the river, and we could have been the guys because then he gave it to the night guy at the same radio station.  Oh, I see.  And we could have been the guys that technically discovered Godsmack.  But I had to be an idiot.  I had to be an idiot.  I'm not going to make the same mistakes. 
[02:43:00]  Plung that right out the window.  There goes fucking Godsmack.  And you know what I like?  That they don't want, like, it's not me doing it.  It's them doing it.  Like you said, you know, these stage parents are the ones that, like, oh, you better practice.  You better do it.  And this is all them just doing it.  You know, it's what they love to do.  They got enough songs for an album?  Yeah, definitely.  I see four in front of me.  Yeah, they definitely.  We're going to go back into the studio, do another three.  There's, you know, they're doing this.  Oh, this is amazing.  What's that fucking one? 
[02:43:30]  Huh?  It's a remake.  They did this remake of, what's that?  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  And the color girls have it on the wild side.  Yeah, but they do something with it that's unbelievable.  You know, they take it to a whole different level.  And I mean, I can't wait to record that.  You know, because that has this, I mean, it's almost like a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo.  Maybe you throw that on the CD.  It's a little taste, too.  Yeah, no, they're going to record it. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  But, you know, I mean, Max's skill as, you know, a drummer also is like in the vein of like a Ginger Baker.  He goes to that level when he plays like live solos.  And, yeah.  I mean, when I saw the tape of the Cat Club, it looked like they speeded the film up, you know.  But he doesn't just go wild.  It's precise what he's doing.  There is, there's another L.A. Rocks, but they're official MySpace's, and I won't give it out just in case.  It's, people are confused.  They're trying to find the MySpace page. 
[02:44:30]  Is there, is there another?  Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's, they have the official, is it a, I don't want to say it, just in case.  In case of what?  It's somebody else.  No, don't say it is.  That's what I'm saying.  That's why I'm writing it down.  There is like another L.A. Rocks floating around out there.  It is it?  Okay, they're saying.  But fuck them.  Official L.A. Rocks on MySpace.  All one word, obviously.  Official L.A. Rocks.  Yeah.  But are W's?  Can you go to it to see if the picture comes up?  Well, you kicked the guy out. 
[02:45:00]  That was good at all that stuff.  I didn't kick the guy out, but you bring him back in.  See what you did?  So we could tell him.  Danny.  Look what you do now.  Yeah, Danny was too close to you, remember?  Roy.  By the way, David is still behind you, Dice.  Dave, what are you staying there for?  Are you the guy that does that?  Did you like L.A. Rocks?  Yeah, I liked it.  I thought it was incredible.  Yeah, really good.  All right, here's Danny.  Now, Dice, you got to apologize, because he's the guy that would have helped you out.  I'm the nicest guy in the world.  What are you talking about?  But he got a little, were you a little insulted?  A little bit.  A little bit.  You can find this for me.  By the legend? 
[02:45:30]  Never.  He said that sarcastically, Dice.  No, I did not.  I know, Danny.  I can't believe how you threw Kenny out of his seat.  That's not right.  Yeah, but he's doing the thing for you.  Kenny.  He's doing the MySpace thing for you.  That's right.  Yeah, that's them.  So what is it?  That's MySpace.com slash official L.A. Rocks.  Yeah, and there's actually a song on there.  There's not a video, but there's a song called Rotten Core.  You're going to get a lot of hits on that song today, Dice.  You're going to see what we could do for you.  You're going to get a lot of freaking hits.  They get to hear a song we didn't play here called Rotten Core.  Well, we can play it here.  This is our thing. 
[02:46:00]  We don't care.  It's better than commercials.  You want to hear Rotten Core?  If you think it's good enough to play, it's your call.  Yeah, it's good enough to play.  Of course it is.  Rotten.  And this is actually the first song they recorded a couple months ago.  And by the way, you're going to be a catalog.  Which is also going to be on the new Dice CD, which would be the break of them, you know.  And so they play me up to it called Filthy Animal, but it's not out yet.  But you could hear it now if you want to play it.  I don't know. 
[02:46:30]  I just had a weird...  You would like Rotten Core.  Yeah, we're going to play it, but I just had a question.  Yeah, go ahead.  Have they ever...  And I don't want to use the word as a goof, but let's just say it.  Go ahead.  As a goof, do they mess around with some of your stand-up and try to put it to music and stuff?  No, but sometimes when we perform, we'll do the Elvis stuff together.  I'll bring them back out.  I mean, I can't believe where they get their stage presence from.  I mean, I know...  It's got to come from me a little bit.  Of course.  You know? 
[02:47:00]  You know?  You know what I mean?  The gorgeousness and everything.  The gorgeousness.  Yeah.  Because you're so handsome.  They might have got that from their mother.  You know what?  Someone has to say it.  You know what?  They got the voice.  Don't they got the voice?  Yeah, I used to call her the singing sensation.  Number one, right, Kenny?  She knows every song.  Of course.  Kenny's going to say, yeah.  No, no, the truth.  Does he ever disagree with you?  No, no, but he knows.  This is no bullshit.  Jimmy, does he ever disagree with us?  Never.  And she was a good dancer, too.  Yeah?  How did she dance? 
[02:47:30]  The dance of love.  All right, stop with the bullshit.  Dance of love.  No, I know what he's talking about.  One night we went somewhere and he didn't want to.  Where were we when the dance of love happened?  Florida.  All right, we're in Florida, right?  Yeah.  And I'm sitting there with Club Soda Kenny and Hot Tub Johnny, right?  And all of a sudden she comes in and there's like, you know, music playing and the place  is empty and she goes into this whole, like, you know, thing.  Yeah.  You know?  And Kenny, oh my goodness.  By the way, you're not one of their top friends. 
[02:48:00]  Who?  Yeah.  On the MySpace.  They got Florentine as one of their top friends.  That's the size.  You know what?  That's okay.  I know them.  I'm friends with them on top of being a father.  Rotten car!  I know them on top of being a father. 
[02:48:30]  I'm the rusty shovel buried in your yard.  I'm the dirty thaw drowning through your mind.  I'm the thing you can't stop, I'll call time. 
[02:49:00]  I'm the creeping man made babies cry.  Yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Come on!  I'm riding through the car, baby, there's no time for me.  I'm a loose cat and overdress, psychopathic, babe. 
[02:49:30]  Take your time, make it slow, use the size from the phone.  Watch it rot, watch it burn.  Never stop, catch it dirt.  Dirt and stick your striving with.  Rock's gonna freeze up your bed.  Never stop, never die.  It's not really even alive.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.  I'm riding through the car, baby, there's no time for me. 
[02:50:00]  I'm a loose cat and overdress, psychopathic, babe.  I'm a loose cat and overdress, psychopathic, babe. 
[02:50:30]  You're fresh!  Yeah.  I'm riding to the car. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Said I'm riding to the car.  Yeah.  Yeah! 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  Fucking great, man.  14 years old.  That's great.  14 effing years old. 
[02:52:00]  Wow.  The scream has a great, the voice has a really cool, like a raspiness in the scream.  It's got like a really cool sound to it.  Yeah, I'm not describing it well.  Yeah, that's the song.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Where are you again?  What's the MySpace again?  Daniel?  Official LA Rocks.  Yeah, official LA Rocks on MySpace.  So that's where people could go and check it out, yeah.  Yeah.  They just started that, too, so.  What are you doing, Ant?  I'm getting crumbs all over.  I see that.  I was eating some saltines, which I must keep away from Jimmy, lest he roll his fist into 
[02:52:30]  a ball and smash them.  Yeah, he breaks his crackers every day.  It's not nice.  Don't bust my crackers.  You have a phone or something you've got to do?  Oh, do I?  Yeah, you've got to plug things to promote, man.  Dice is at Caroline's this Friday and Saturday and Sunday.  This Sunday.  2-1-2-7.  No, Sunday?  No, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Oh, well, we have the shoot.  Wednesday, Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Sunday.  No, mid-thursday, Friday, Saturday, right?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Caroline's 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, they're saying. 
[02:53:00]  And what?  Greg says Friday through Sunday.  Greg says Friday through Sunday, you're wrong.  Get the fuck out of here.  What do you mean?  Yeah, you better get Greg in here and give him a fuck out of here.  Yeah, Greg.  Get Greg in his fucking line.  Call Caroline.  Do me a favor.  Now there's confusion there, Greg.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  What's this?  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Is it?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Greg, please.  We're going to find out, because I don't want to get wrong.  No, no, it is.  It's Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Does he know?  How do you know?  I, it's right, yeah, I work there.  I work with Lewis.  Lewis booked it.  How you doing, Greg?  Good, how you doing?  Call up over there and ask, because he's the guy, though, Dice. 
[02:53:30]  I don't want to be this, sir.  I wanted to be that Thursday.  If you call Caroline, you get him on the phone.  Yeah, he's the guy.  But we're lucky enough to have him in studio today.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Who, Lewis?  Him?  Tell me.  Greg.  Oh, you're from Caroline's?  You didn't know that?  You didn't book me.  No, no, no.  But I work with Lewis.  I get more for Sunday night.  Ah, well, that's not me.  Yeah, see, that's not the guy.  Now we've got a problem, right?  Why did I think I was Thursday?  Wait, we've got to get the number out.  212-757-4100. 
[02:54:00]  It's Friday through Sunday.  It's hysterical.  I take Greg at his word.  You better change your flight.  And also, where am I?  May 21st.  Where else am I?  May 21st.  Hold on.  May 21st, Tarrytown Music Hall.  How do you know?  Because I have it right in front of me.  What the fuck is wrong with you, Kenny?  I don't know.  I'm trying to figure.  I'm trying to tell you.  That's upstate.  It's not that far from the city, actually.  It's Tarrytown Music Hall.  It's on Main Street in Tarrytown.  I think that's Debekeepsie, right, Kenny?  In the area. 
[02:54:30]  Well said.  Nice, Kenny.  TarrytownMusicHall.org or 914-631-3390.  And that's an 8 o'clock show.  That's for Tarrytown.  Yeah, that's the 21st.  May 21st.  Did you use Eleanor yet to do the opening, like you said?  No.  I haven't done a gig.  Yeah, I haven't done a gig yet.  Eleanor Kerrigan.  You know her, right?  Jim's getting lazy.  What's that about?  Remember the girl I used to see?  Eleanor's a nice lady.  Yeah.  I mean...  Her brothers are fans of the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, her.  I like her.  Her and Joan Rivers.  I'd have to say, like, the best female comics in the country. 
[02:55:00]  Eleanor's good on their...  I never...  She's like a young Joan Rivers.  Wow.  Is that the Tappan Zee over there?  It's close to the Tappan Zee?  Yeah.  Okay.  You're close to the Tappan Zee.  How far away is...  Far.  Is Syracuse?  Like, how...  No, really.  Four hours, maybe?  Five hours?  Five hours.  You got five hours.  By car, yeah.  By plane.  I can't believe this.  My agent tells me, like, it's like two hours.  No.  By plane?  By...  Helicopter? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Why don't they just tell me?  Get a dice copter.  Because they figure once you're here.  What are you doing seriously?  So you didn't...  So she didn't open for you?  She lied to me?  Not yet she hasn't, no.  But I told her we would work together, but I haven't done gigs since I saw you.  I haven't done any headline gigs.  And you're the one that told her that she's like Joan Rivers?  No.  Who's better, Eleanor or Joan Rivers, in your opinion?  I haven't seen Eleanor.  Yeah, no, she goes, like, to the audience, like, you know, and I'm just talking about  it because... 
[02:56:00]  Yeah?  Because I was just with Joan Rivers.  No, I don't go with her no more.  You know what I mean?  I haven't gone with her in years.  Do you like the Joan Rivers?  I love Joan Rivers.  I like her a lot better than the daughter.  Well, I don't know what the daughter does, really.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  So why is she on TV every time we turn it on?  Joan is...  I saw Joan do an hour set.  You should have a thing if you're going to be on TV every day.  And she don't even play guitar.  Right.  Oh, look at Paiklin.  Why was I handed this?  That's an E-Rock call.  I'm trying...  I have tried to figure out...  What happened?  ...why I was handed...  E-Rock came by. 
[02:56:30]  This girl up there would be a great porno star.  Look at that blonde.  It is nothing but...  I don't know what's going on anymore.  ...distracting to me.  I have no idea what this is.  Tell him, E-Rock, E-Rock, E-Rock, what is this, and why was it handed to everybody?  This was a Steve C call, because this is...  Oh, now it's a Steve C call.  Look, if we noticed, a pass the buck just happened.  I like that.  Because this is the morning show that Dice has to make a phoner for.  So we wanted to see if he wanted to do it live here on the air and call this other show.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But maybe it should have said something on here.  Let me do that, because I don't really want to go here, but because Tom Hanks came in, 
[02:57:00]  they gave him the time, and I had to wait.  We just expect Tom Hanks, Ron Howard.  Tom Hanks' friend, Ron Howard, came in.  Let me just explain something quickly to anybody.  Regardless of who did this, wouldn't you write a little note here going,  Dice is doing a funny...  You laid down this Wink 106 thing with Ali's emails, War of the Roses,  and what they do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...  I had no idea...  What am I supposed to do?  Are these guys coming in?  I have no idea what this was.  No, but what am I supposed to do with these people?  Exactly.  What am I supposed to do with them? 
[02:57:30]  Can we make a quick call to them, and I'll talk to them?  Yeah, let's do it.  All right.  But what am I supposed to promote?  What?  On what?  I guess Ope has it right in front of him.  There should be one on everybody.  What do I got?  Because I can't then, in the middle, ask Ope,  Ope, what is that that was just handed to you in the middle of a conversation or something?  Why are you talking to the Wink wake-up crew in Elmira, New York?  Don't you have high blood pressure?  To promote probably the charge.  Don't you have high blood pressure?  No, no, no.  My blood pressure's nice.  No, but you've got to relax yourself a little.  All right.  You're too high-strung.  He's not. 
[02:58:00]  He's got too much vulgarity.  Here we go.  Look at it.  Do the old.  Nice and calm.  I'm Anthony Kuhl.  Look, Anthony Kuhl.  I'll be Anthony Kuhl.  I taught him the old.  There is an Anthony Kuhl.  Is there?  I went to see him with Kenny and Norton in Vegas.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No.  Remember the magician or the psychic, whatever he was?  Here we go.  Here's Kenny.  No.  You don't remember that?  In the start?  No.  No.  When we sat there and the guy was bringing people on stage, you were right there next to me. 
[02:58:30]  He must have hypnotized me.  Don't fuck it.  I guess he did.  You were explaining a TV appearance where you got paid, because what the fuck was it?  Oh, Conan.  Oh, the Conan appearance.  Oh, when you did the girl tricks?  Yeah, yeah.  He brought them out and made Kenny do dog tricks.  Yeah, roll over.  Roll over and shit.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but Conan didn't appreciate, remember, when we did the Elvis thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, he couldn't bring that up, right? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  What did he say?  Yeah, he said, it's good to see, Dice, that you demean men as equally as you demean women.  Oh.  After we did such a great Elvis number.  Yeah, you sang like a songbird.  I mean, it's amazing.  You want to sing some Elvis for everybody?  You boys sang like birds.  You don't have the music.  Show them.  I got to tinkle.  Go get some fucking Elvis music so we can hear Dice.  We're going to show him where his son got the vocals from.  Let me warm up.  Yeah, how do you warm up?  I got to warm up.  How do you warm up?  I got to do the scale.  How do you warm up?  I got to turn into him.  Okay.  I got to turn into him. 
[02:59:30]  All right, focus.  Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, ah, you know, rock and roll  music, I came along when rock and roll music had no trend.  And I feel very lucky.  Wait, let me take a drink, man.  Let me take a drink.  Well, well, well, well, well, where's the music, though?  They don't know what song to bring.  What song you want?  What do you think?  You just do any key, any, you know?  How about indigado? 
[03:00:00]  Nah, that bores me too much.  How about, uh, what are some of those albums?  If I was with Elvis back then, I can walk out.  That's awful.  See, I hate that.  Because I love you too much.  What?  No.  What's that?  I was just doing a baby part.  What did we do on Conan?  We did C.C. Ryder, right?  Yeah.  Nah, that's not an Elvis song.  What do you mean?  Elvis, there was no better opening than C.C. Ryder for Elvis.  But the other guy did it, originally.  No, no, but Elvis made it famous.  Nah, the other guy didn't.  What other guy? 
[03:00:30]  I don't know his name.  Jerry Lee?  Yeah, something like that.  Oh, it could have been.  C.C. DeVille?  What?  Well, I'm going, going baby.  What do you want to do?  You ever hear our Laughing Elvis clip?  Let me hear it.  Oh, that one's great.  You've never heard Laughing Elvis?  No.  You had to have.  You're an Elvis fan?  No, I did.  Yeah.  So he was just saying no.  You don't know?  I don't know.  Do I know?  He's laughing in the middle of a song.  You can't get the song out because he's laughing so hard.  Yeah, no, I know.  I don't know if you know.  No, but I've heard it because I got all the albums. 
[03:01:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Elvis bloopers.  That one.  The one where he's fucking his underage girl.  Wife.  The one where he's shooting a television set.  You know, bloopers.  Elvis bloopers.  I never heard that one.  Neither did I.  How do you say anything about Elvis?  I'm sorry.  The world loves Elvis.  How about we take a break?  I'm sorry.  Couldn't take a break.  Take a break.  We've been on an hour and a half.  We're tired from our Tom Hanks interview.  We forgot.  Tom Hanks.  You forgot.  We've been on the air since Tom Hanks pretty much.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  All right.  We're going to take a break.  So what do you want to do?  Take a quick break.  We're going to do Laughing Elvis.  And then you come by and you come back and sing a little Elvis for everybody.  We bring it down a little bit.  Let's see what song.  You warm up the voice.  We play Laughing Elvis.  We come back and we do more.  Yeah, but you're going to play the Laughing Elvis through the song.  I know what you're going to do.  No, I ain't messing with it.  Oh, really?  We're doing that at the break.  Oh, what?  You'll have the stage when we come back.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Yeah, that's what we do.  Dice and Caroline's.  Don't make me like I'm stupid.  Dice and Caroline's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 212-757-4100.  Hit the Laughing Elvis. 
[03:02:00]  Are you lonesome tonight?  Do you miss me tonight?  Are you sorry we drifted apart?  Does your memory stray to a bright summer day when I kissed you and called you, sweet heart? 
[03:02:30]  I do the chairs in your boiler seem empty and bare.  Do you gaze at your bald head and wish you had hair?  Is your heart filled with pain?  Shall I come back?  Tell me, dear, are you lonesome? 
[03:03:00]  Oh, Lord, Lord.  I wonder.  You know, someone said, the world's a stage and each must play a part.  Oh, God. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  And I had no cause to die.  Sing it, baby. 
[03:04:00]  Shall I come back again?  Tell me, dear, are you lonesome?  Is your heart filled with pain?  Shall I come back again?  Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?  Oh, God.  Wow, it sounds like you're about to listen to a very important radio show after that promo. 
[03:04:30]  Opie and Anthony, what?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What is whispering going on?  Tell me, too.  Thank God Dice is back in studio.  It's like a Terminator screening at, like, 11 or something.  But did they just tell us now?  I know.  Why not tell us now?  Yeah, they told us, like, fucking, you know, like, five minutes ago, I would have liked to have, you know, gone. 
[03:05:00]  Exactly.  What is this?  I can't, though.  I got shit to do.  We got things to do.  I got things.  Last we left you, Dice was going to go talk to, what's the name of the show again?  I forgot.  Scott and Allie.  Scott and Allie from the Wink Wake Up Crew in Elmira, New York.  The Wink Wake Up Crew.  How did that go, Dice?  That was good.  They asked me the same question three times.  What's your language, Dice?  I know what kind of loose count of this guy could be. 
[03:05:30]  You got to look out for Andrew Dice Clay.  They taped it.  Oh, they taped it.  Of course.  Hey, look, guys, before Dice calls, I'd like to say, we should tape this, because he has  a reputation of saying things that are shocking and could get us in trouble.  Saucy would be the word.  Saucy.  Saucy.  Saucy.  And could get our job.  We could jeopardize our jobs.  So tape it.  I see what you're doing.  Are you into her?  I'm not.  Who?  Tyra?  Tyra?  Or the other bit.  I like Tyra a lot.  Yeah, I like Tyra.  I don't like where she talks. 
[03:06:00]  You like the other one?  Who even listens?  That's why, like, when that thing happened.  Uh, with Miss California the other day?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who cares what she says about anything?  What she said?  Nobody ever goes out with a chick because she's smart.  She answered the question perfectly.  Nobody ever goes, she's the smartest thing.  I got to go out with her.  Look at this.  Jesus Christ, what a box.  You can see the meat pocket right through her fucking panties.  Yeah.  Looking at Kim Kardashian.  Oh, is that who that is? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, but I like her other sister, who I found out is actually older.  I always thought was younger.  Who, Chloe?  The one that was on Apprentice?  Chloe, like, got herself together.  She's starting to look all right.  She was a...  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know if you know her, but she was kind of a slob, and now she's, like, losing  the weight and looking pretty good.  No, I told her.  I got one word, Chloe.  Treadmill.  It's Courtney, I think.  I don't know that one, but Chloe was on The Apprentice, and yeah, she's got back.  She's doing all right.  Yeah, I mean, if she wants to...  Yeah, I mean, look at her sister.  She's in movies, everything.  Everything. 
[03:07:00]  Junk in the trunk.  Mm-hmm.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  She does, like, great movies.  Do you like ass-fucking for real?  Who, me?  Yeah.  You know what?  For your birthday.  I can take it or leave it.  You know what?  It's a tight hole.  It's a tight hole.  It's not like what I look for.  Oh, wait a minute.  Kenny's going to help me out.  Wait a minute.  Kenny's on the mic.  Yes, Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  We don't want to lose this, Jim.  That's the moment.  Go, Kenny.  Go.  Ass-fucking.  It's an art form.  Did he say that once?  That's the whole thing? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Because he knows all my stuff better than me.  Of course.  Yeah, it was never like...  You know what?  What don't you like about it?  I'm really into the vaginal area.  Mm-hmm.  But I like a beefy vagina.  Well, we've heard from the king of the loving, beefy vagina,  Jim Norton.  I love it.  It's my fetish.  He loves a fat one.  Yeah.  Oh, maybe he's got another thing.  If a girl don't have a beefy box, there's nothing...  Yeah, but he doesn't like to wear out the vagina,  so he goes, ass cunt, ass cunt, ass cunt. 
[03:08:00]  No, no, you're doing it wrong.  Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  Boo.  Ass pussy, ass pussy, ass it.  T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.  Ass, ass, ass putty, putty, putty, putty, putty, putty, putty, putty.  Ass putty, ass putty, ass putty, ass putty.  Ass, ass.  Oh, is that why you're saying that?  Because of that bit?  No.  No.  I was only just asking because I was thinking...  I really don't want to fuck anybody in the ass.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes you put a couple fingers in there just to keep your hands busy  while you're working on the pussy.  Right.  And I'm not looking to come off course. 
[03:08:30]  You know, because I've changed in a lot of ways.  Sensitive guy?  Yeah.  But sometimes, like, if you lodge your thumb a little bit in the ease...  A little bit, a little bit.  You get good leverage.  Oh, that's true.  It's almost like just to hold something.  Right, right.  Kenny's back.  Oh, Kenny?  You remember when that chick said to you, fuck the shit out of me?  And you said, won't that be messy? 
[03:09:00]  All right, there's pussy, ass, pussy, ass, pussy, ass, pussy.  But why are you even asking that?  Why are you...  Fuck, don't you get so happy?  Wait, Kenny's back.  Kenny's back.  You love to eat ass because shit tastes like sherbet.  You get in there wide.  You open it up with, like, a Tonkin truck.  You stick it in there.  Dice, I'm thinking...  You get in there deep.  I'm thinking franchise for you. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, franchise him out.  Franchise the Dice name.  It's amazing how he remembers...  Because stuff he's saying, I know it's mine, but I don't remember it.  Have him throw the sideburns.  And then the payoff is your cum, because your cum is nutritious.  Yeah, that is so thick, pulpy, and chunky.  Yeah.  Right now, Campbell Soup is trying to package my cum.  My cum comes in flavors.  All right, please, I can't hear album three. 
[03:10:00]  Please.  It's fucking out of his mind.  God damn Kenny, man.  He should be like Gallagher, too.  Just hit the road.  It's hysterical.  I fly over the crop duster to give girls my cum.  They're running around like little birds.  Vroom, vroom, vroom.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I honestly just asked, because that girl had a great ass, and you said, look, I like the  box, and I remember you talking about ass-fucking a lot, and I'm just like, do you really like  ass-fucking a lot? 
[03:10:30]  No, it's really, I just like the ass-up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  That's my favorite part of the female anatomy.  Face down, ass-up, that's the way we want to fuck.  Please.  What, he's balling you now?  No, no, he's not.  Of course he is.  Of course he is.  The ass-up, but...  Ass-up.  But it's a pussy.  Yeah, like the normal way.  Something to grab onto your look.  The normal way.  You're probably like me.  Are you very visually stimulated?  Yeah.  I like to look at what you do.  I don't like everyone under the blanket, and shit like that. 
[03:11:00]  I don't like the lights all the way off.  I like before you crack it up, and you go, honey, show me what I get.  I like the whole line I like to look at.  He hates to come home, and the hair's in a bun, and there's no makeup.  It's like, hey, honey, who erased your face?  Take the bun out of your head.  Steven S. from Bay Show writes, Kenny can go around as Andrew Dunst Clay.  He's sweating doing this.  He is.  He loves it.  He's doing an act.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  He's doing the act.  Yeah.  Well, you see how he lunges up out of his seat to do one of the lines.  Why not just pull the mic down?  Nah, I'm animated.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you are animated.  Anybody can do it sitting down.  I do it standing up.  I'll even work with the mic without the stand.  Animated.  Bugs dummy.  I've been doing a lot of that lately.  That's all right.  All right, sit back down.  Kenny's sweating profusely.  We're just doing a show.  Jesus.  All right.  Kenny really is retarded, is one of the people. 
[03:12:00]  He really thinks you're retarded.  Now what?  Now what do we do?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  What the fuck do I know?  What is that?  What the fuck?  Caroline's.  Friday, Saturday, Saturday.  I love when it gets quiet on the show.  I really do like that.  I like it.  It's comfortable.  It's called the dynamic.  Yeah, you don't always need yelling and screaming.  A little bit, though.  No.  Yeah, but we've been doing it.  Look what he just did.  I know.  He did good.  He just gave them ten.  And then you can sit down and take a breath. 
[03:12:30]  Everyone just, yeah.  Maybe the people listening want to relax a little.  Right.  That's why we play the commercials.  That's relaxing.  What happened to C.C. Ryder?  Where are we?  Oh, you want to still do the Elvis?  I don't know.  He doesn't know if he's got it.  Oh, you want to do C.C. Ryder?  I don't know.  I really don't.  I want to hear Elvis.  I never heard you actually sing Elvis.  Well, if he plays it, I'll join in.  I'll do a little bit.  Can we go a little low?  Let me see.  I need it louder in my headphones.  I can't.  Just turn up here. 
[03:13:00]  Hold on.  Let's start.  Kenny.  Tell me when the volume is right, and then we'll start the song over.  That's right.  No, we need it from...  Does he have every CD?  Yeah.  Every CD ever made.  No, the guy putting this on.  Yeah.  Master computer.  Let's hear it from Elvis in Concert, it says.  Oh, boy.  Travis?  I got live in Vegas.  Live in Vegas.  The Vegas C.C. Ryder's okay, but...  I'll tell you what I got.  I got three of them.  You know what's good?  Yeah, tell me. 
[03:13:30]  I got on stage February 19...  All right, do that.  That's fine.  Oh, my God.  You do know Elvis.  That should be pretty good.  Sweet Caroline, you like that?  No.  No.  That's really like a Neil Don...  I get mad at Elvis when he does those.  Really?  Yeah, but any ballad he does, you know, Bridge Over Troubled Water, or the other one he  does...  Yeah, in the guitar.  You never close your eyes, that one.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Every ballad he does better than anybody else.  Unchained Melody. 
[03:14:00]  He did a great Unchained Melody.  Yeah, phenomenal.  Oh, yeah, that one was good.  I'll give him that one.  It's my favorite Elvis song.  Is it?  Yeah, the favorite thing he did, yeah.  Hmm.  Where's the man with the music?  Yeah, what the fuck?  He's got it.  Oh, there it is.  That's not it.  Okay, man.  Come on, Travis, you zilch.  He's playing the same one.  Is he?  Yeah, he's on the ice.  That's the one that's labeled On Stage 1970.  He's over there.  Go on.  Go on.  Right here.  I'll try.  I got to feel it.  You want the next one?  What's the next one? 
[03:14:30]  Let me hear the other one.  Let's get the lights down, Dice.  Let's get this right.  Turn the lights down.  Where's Travis?  Why is no one filming?  Where's the next one?  Hold on.  Let's all...  No, cut it.  What are you doing?  Turn the lights back on.  Travis, you're panicking.  That's fun.  I'm not panicking.  I played one, and now I played the other.  Well, what?  You don't just blend them.  Why are you yelling at Dice?  I'm not yelling at Dice.  Which one is this from?  Okay, this one is going to be Live from Las Vegas.  No, we don't want Vegas.  Okay. 
[03:15:00]  You said you got three.  I have three.  I have one on stage February 1970.  That's the first one that I played for you.  You said that's not the one you made.  All right, so what else?  Then I have Live from Vegas.  Yeah.  And then I have a Touch of Platinum Volume 2.  That's all we have in the computer, though.  Let me hear the Touch of Platinum.  All right.  All right, here.  But you got to cut it at FaceTime.  Sure.  You don't yell at Dice.  I would never yell at Dice.  I didn't like the tone.  I got to pick my collar up for this.  All right, Dice, let's do this again.  All right.  A little Elvis.  I never do Elvis in the morning.  Here we go.  A little dim. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, I'll see you.  See you.  Do the fucking 71.  Oh, see you.  The other one.  The first.  I told him.  Fuck it.  Dim the lights.  All right, here we go.  Now, dim the lights?  Yeah, well, you said that.  Oh, all right.  Let's go.  I'll let him start.  I'll just join him for a minute.  This is Extra Talent.  I got to hear it in my headphones loud.  Oh, my God.  I said, see you.  I said, see you right up.  Oh, see now what you have done. 
[03:16:00]  Well, she made me love.  Dun, dun, dun.  I'm coming home.  Tell me what I say.  Well, I'm going.  Going, baby.  And I won't be battle for.  I'm going.  I got to fuck.  Going, baby.  And I won't be battle for.  If I find me a good girl, I won't.  I won't.  I won't be back at all. 
[03:16:30]  Tell me what I say.  Rip it up, man.  I said, see you.  Damn.  All right.  We did it up.  All right.  Well, yeah.  He nailed it.  Yep.  That's not even a version, I don't know.  It's good.  But you know all the words.  What else is on that scene?  What other songs?  Come on, Travis.  Fucking making everybody wait.  Yeah, he's panicking.  He is.  He's hit the Elvis.  I'm not panicking.  What's the list of songs?  Do you know how many Elvis songs we have in here?  Why don't you tell us?  Name some.  Start naming them.  You want stuff from on stage? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Hang on.  Hey, Travis, are you annoyed with dice?  I hear it in your voice.  Yep.  Let's get it out on the radio.  No, no, no.  I would never be annoyed with dice.  What's the problem?  No, Travis, you know, I just do things a certain way.  I know.  I'm trying to accommodate you.  All right.  From on stage 1970.  Yeah.  The Wonder of You.  Nah, I'm bored.  Sweet Caroline.  Fuck that.  Proud Mary.  And that's it.  That's it?  That's all from that album.  What's from Vegas?  What do you got in Vegas?  Vegas, hang on.  How much Elvis we got to do here?  I don't know.  See, normally Elvis you do at night.  Always at night.  You only did one.  Let's do another one. 
[03:17:30]  I'm going to film from above.  Let's do Grease Lightning.  No, stop it.  Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang.  All right.  I only do this for certain guests.  You don't, I'll be.  I go up over here now.  You're going to hurt yourself.  All right.  Well, let's find the song for us.  All right.  Up on the console.  All right.  I'm going to do all your favorite songs, ladies and gentlemen.  All, uh, Viva Las Vegas.  1,452 of them.  Let's make a video.  Hold it.  My, my lip.  Oh, look at this.  It's jammed.  This is like Quentin Tarantino-ing stuff, man. 
[03:18:00]  You ready?  Well, I got to find the song.  It's not any songs.  All right.  From Viva Las Vegas.  What?  From Viva Las Vegas.  The album Viva Las Vegas.  Oh, boy.  Now we got issues.  Viva Las Vegas?  Yeah, Viva Las Vegas.  It's a good one.  If you say you don't need me, baby.  Hard Knocks.  What I'd say.  Big love.  Big heartache.  Viva Las Vegas.  Do the Vega.  It's a wonderful world.  Do the Vega.  And you wonder why Elvis went nuts.

The lady loves me.  Come on.  We need Robert Santa for Come on, everybody.  No, we need a hit so people out there know.  So go back to the concert stuff.  Go to Vegas.  All right.  Hang on.  Jesus.  This is supposed to be so annoying.  Do you know the name of the album?  I'm sorry.  I'm not a huge Elvis guy.  Do you know the name of the album you're looking for?  Because then I could just go to that album. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, go with the...  Okay, go to the thing.  Go to Elvis, like at Madison Square Garden.  All right.  We could have done this an hour ago.  Elvis.  Oh, I've got a lot more Elvis from Las Vegas.  That might be earlier.  But that's not what I told you to do.  Elvis in concert.  Elvis...  Holy shit.  Elvis in concert.  That was the right CC Rider. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, he asked you for that before.  But we don't have that from Elvis in concert.  They've only got eight or nine songs.  All right.  Let's see the songs.  You've got to tell me the songs.  My Way.  Nah.  Hawaiian Wedding Song.  No.  And actually, that's it.  The rest of them is just him talking.  What?  Elvis fans comments.  Keep going.  That's it.  That's all from Elvis in concert.  All right.  So go...  Didn't you say eight or nine songs?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's before I saw some of them were comments.  All right.  What else you got?  I have Elvis 56. 
[03:20:00]  I love how he keeps saying I got Elvis 56.  What else you got?  Collection, collection, Christmas duets.  No.  Can't you pull up an album?  Yeah, I'm reading you the albums.  Get Aloha Hawaii.  Get the Hawaii album.  All right.  Elvis in Hawaii.  He's fucking...  Aren't you the guy that found my kids MySpace?  No, that's Danny.  He's right there to your right.  No, Danny's the pro.  Danny, so why the fuck aren't you working this?  That's his thing.  Wait, get Danny's mic on over there. 
[03:20:30]  That's his thing.  Yeah.  What can I do from the couch?  I can't help.  Did you get it yet?  You already put him on the couch.  He can't do nothing.  It was only in 170 countries that played that special.  Tyson's got everyone frazzled.  Oh, I...  Yeah.  Danny's on the couch.  You got Elvis 68 comeback special?  Travis, come on.  That was a big one.  Oh, that's a big one.  Huh?  That's a big one, Travis.  We all know that one.  I have Elvis 56.  He didn't ask you for that.  That's not what I asked you for.  I have Elvis is back.

Elvis in Hawaii.  Can you find...  We don't have that.  All right.  Can you find...  All right.  Elvis something else.  Just something else.  From Nashville to Memphis?  Give us a song.  At this point, we need a song.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  If you give me a song, I can tell you which version of that song I have.

[03:49:00]  I see this great  Metal CD rack  So I just  Clip it  I just pick it up  And start heading  Towards the door  And some salesman goes  Excuse me  Excuse  And I gotta tell you  About another thing  He goes  Excuse me  He goes  You know  You gotta pay for that  I go  No no no  It's handled  That's that guy  Over there  And I just walk out  With it  Right  So now the last time  I was there  That's that guy  Over there  Yeah 
[03:49:30]  No  Because I figure  What is it  It's not a hundred dollars  They'd probably buy it  For ten  You know  You give it away  You make a person  Feel good  Right  You know  So now  The last time  The last time  I'm there  One of my kids  Drums are broken  Okay  So I go to Sam Ash  With this bass drum  And I just walk in  And I put it down  And I take another one  Just like it  That's not cracked  And this guy goes  Excuse me  And I go  Yeah  Can I help you  With something
