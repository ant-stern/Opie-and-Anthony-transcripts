<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from 115 Bourbon Street in Chicago was a raucous, alcohol-fueled event featuring Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  The show opened with enthusiastic, vulgar introductions and immediately launched into a series of audience interactions.  Anthony confessed to losing $7,000 gambling the previous night.  Eric Bloom, from the band Blue Öyster Cult (erroneously identified as "Blue Is the Cult"), claimed Hatfield heritage and boasted about fathering a child with a South Chicago woman.  A heavily tattooed audience member in aviator sunglasses was a frequent target of the hosts' and producer Sam's ribbing, repeatedly described as "weird."  Numerous audience members were brought to the microphone, contributing to a continuous stream of crude humor, sexual innuendo, and personal anecdotes, often centered around gambling, alcohol, and physical descriptions.  Several drinking games, involving Jägermeister shots, were conducted with the audience, comprised largely of women. A “Chip off the old block” contest, judged by audience reaction, awarded $500 to the best imitation of a character named "Chip." One man astonishingly revealed he postponed brain surgery to attend the show.  Early in the broadcast, a guest named Jimmy let out a massive fart that reportedly “wiped out” the front row.

The show featured a recurring bit involving Chris Farley impersonations, with memorable attempts from audience members John and Jordan Boyle, the latter trying a “Chip” impression as well.  Coke Logic, a recurring character, contributed a mullet-adorned hat as a “Chip Chipperson” look-alike, leading to further bizarre impersonation attempts, fueled by more drinking and highly suggestive jokes.  A "bad breath contest," judged by E-Rock, escalated into a grotesque spectacle involving vomit ingestion, resulting in considerable laughter and disgust.  A surprise appearance by CM Punk injected further energy into the proceedings.

A significant portion of the show focused on an "Oddest Thing You Own" contest, with entries including a kangaroo scrotum, a World War II prophylactic kit (which ultimately won $1000), a shoe purportedly from Ground Zero (prompting a heated debate about authenticity), pieces of the Berlin Wall, a dog skull, a Nazi fireman's axe (whose authenticity was questioned), and a *Curb Your Enthusiasm* painting of Jesus.  The contest was punctuated by the show's characteristic vulgar language, jokes about sex, drugs, and death.  The show ended with repetitive thank-yous to the audience and mentions of free streams on the OPN Anthony Channel, without any further guest appearances.

[00:04:30]  Oh my goodness.  Yeah, mother fuckers. 
[00:05:00]  Oh my God, this is fucking cool.  Chicago!  Fucking Chicago.  This is amazing.  Oh, wherever the hell we are.  That's like being out on Long Island in New York and saying, New York City!  Just ain't quite it.  Hey, could everybody put their arms up so I can Twitter a picture and make it look like  more than it is?  Oh, that's good, Jimmy.  Hi.  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  All right.  Don't worry, just stand there and let me and Jimmy survey the pussy.  Yeah.  How uncomfortable would it be if we all just panicked and then had nothing to say for two  hours?  Like every day on the show.  Yeah, I was going to say, it wouldn't be the first time.  How did Sam do for everybody?  Oh my goodness.  Wow.  I got to tell you. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, this is our first time in this, I'll just say in this area.  But we're staying in Chicago.  And, oh, Jimmy, you farted again.  Jimmy, you're nervous?  Yeah.  I know.  I purposely didn't shit before I left.  Wait, I can smell it over there?  I can smell it.  I thought I...  I knew you didn't shit because I thought I smelled cum.  Who's this guy? 
[00:06:30]  Yes.  This guy's going to be a problem.  We've done this way too many times.  We know this guy will be a problem.  Eric Bloom from Blue Is the Cult.  Hold on, Sam, Mike.  Oh, where'd you come from?  I came here from...  I came here from...  Wait.  Oh, man.  They can't hear it, Sam.  Why wouldn't we be able to hear it?  Put it on so everyone can hear it. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  Okay.  My name's Lauren Hatfield.  Hatfield from West Virginia.  Oh, shit.  From West Virginia.  You're a Hatfield?  Yeah, Hatfield.  And I...  How come you're not a Hat Valley?  This thing?  Good one, Chip.  I just got a hot appetite and you are something.  So you drove up from Virginia.  Why?  Oh, well...  He's a Hatfield! 
[00:07:30]  Because I like your dumb ass.  All right.  You like Anthony.  No, but seriously, all bullshit aside,  I got a baby mom on South Chicago, so...  Somehow that didn't surprise us.  Yes.  That's great.  She's Hispanic, too, so, you know.  You all right with that, Ant?  Yeah, I have no problem with whatever this guy does.  Believe me.  I'm in a band.  It's called...  Of course you are. 
[00:08:00]  So...  It's called...  Yeah, so is the guy that shot up that church.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah?  Actually, I stole from a church music equipment,  but my band's called...  The Serpent Handlers...  Hold on a second.  You stole musical equipment from a church?  No.  No.  I didn't go to church.  My band's called The Serpent Handlers of West Virginia.  That's what it's called. 
[00:08:30]  The Serpent Handlers.  Oh, I know what that means.  Yeah.  The Spitting Serpent.  Oh, he wants more.  Oh, boy.  I think...  That's okay.  So far, you've contributed nothing, so it's all right.  I don't think you need any more mic time.  Wow.  Wow.  Come on, Sam.  You know, some technical difficulties.  I was up very, very late last night.  You know, I like to gamble.  And I went to a casino. 
[00:09:00]  You guys didn't go.  I guess you were hanging out.  But it was really...  I felt like I was with the entire cast of every episode of First 48.  I have never been to a more ghetto casino in my life.  And I've been to some real shitholes.  Is that good or bad?  Well, it was interesting.  I almost felt good that I didn't win.  Because I knew they'd have bashed me over the fucking head and stole whatever I won.  I felt like a winner for losing. 
[00:09:30]  It's ironic that the man who fucking screams,  Blackjack!  Wants a really fucking gentleman's establishment.  Keith had to bring him a pillow to scream into and punch.  In the room.  Wait, wait.  When you get fucked up...  I couldn't think of it.  Fucking chip up.  Fucking chip up.  All right.  How did you do, Ant, by the way? 
[00:10:00]  Did he do good?  I dropped seven grand.  Ouch.  Wow.  Yeah.  And really in no time either.  Oh, that never happens.  Yeah.  I got my ass handed to me.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but I thought I might have lost more just walking to my car.  It was...  Wow.  Yeah.  But we'll be there Saturday also.  You know, Jimmy's doing the...  Anti-social show.  Yeah, anti-social show.  Yeah, yay.  How many people are going to that?  Going to that one? 
[00:10:30]  Nice.  All right.  Nice.  Tickets still available.  You bet they are.  Yeah, something told me from walking around that casino, not a big Jimmy Norton crowd.  Yeah.  Holy fan.  Huh?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We should just give him his own mic, right?  Yeah, he's a psychopath.  Fucking really weird jail tattoos and aviator sunglasses.  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  He don't shut up.  And look, Sam gravitates to him because this is the kind of guest he'd have on his shit show. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  What are we going to say?  I'm Jim Jones.  Hey, asshole, shut the fuck up.  Oh, shit.  Go ahead, Sam.  He's talking to you, Opie.  Wow.  Yes, sir?  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Where are you from?  I'm from Janesville, Wisconsin.  All right. 
[00:11:30]  Hey, we got all some cheese.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  They don't like it.  We got a lot of people from a lot of different areas.  We noticed a lot of different license plates out there.  How many did you print up?  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of people from a lot of different places.  Very cool.  Wait, the Wisconsin guy strung back in shame.  Sam, where are you going?  We're talking to the Wisconsin guy.  Holy shit, she's cute.  We want him more than where he's from. 
[00:12:00]  Fucking asshole.  What were you saying, sir?  The Doubletree.  It's a hotel!  Why did you say Doubletree?  You're staying there?  Yeah.  What, are you putting out the feelers?  No, you don't.  I think the gentleman next to you might be interested.  He's invited.  He goes, fuck.  Wait, what's happening at the Doubletree?  I'm sorry?  What's happening at the Doubletree?  Why are you saying Doubletree?  It's close.  I didn't want a long cab ride. 
[00:12:30]  But why are you telling us?  Yeah, why are you telling us what you're saying?  I don't know.  You're asking questions.  I'm answering.  Wow.  All right.  He really is a right-to-the-point kind of guy.  He really is.  Yeah.  Hey!  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wait.  Hey, whoa.  Where are they going?  Oh, he's all right.  You don't have to throw him out.  Yeah, don't throw him out.  He's all right.  Don't throw him out.  Just punch him in the face.  Let him hang out over there.  Don't throw him out.  Don't throw him out.  Don't throw him out.  Just kind of put him back in the crowd so he's got to work his way up like a fucking salmon. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  He's having fun.  Don't toss him.  He's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're allowing you to drink, right?  I like this afternoon shit.  It reminds me of the good old days when we used to do afternoon drive and I was completely  drunk all the time as opposed to half drunk in the morning.  We did nothing.  It's more fun being Anthony than it is me or Opie.  Me and him just go to dinner like a couple of fruits and ants out fucking gambling and 
[00:13:30]  cursing like De Niro in Mean Streets.  But then I have to pop et cetera like Pez.  I get a headache and a hangover.  What are you going to do?  It happens.  And poor Keith has to deal with my hijinks and shenanigans all night long.  I'm just ready to feed back.  We went to the Willis Tower last night.  I went with Keith.  What are you talking about?  I know.  It's the Sears Tower for these people.  Somebody Twittered the very funny thing that I should try going to the Dudley Tower.  It's right near the bite shop. 
[00:14:00]  Somebody Twittered the very funny one.  It's a molestation joke.  Yeah, you know.  Hilarious.  Yeah, with his fucking father with giant teeth.  I'm like, Dudley, I was worried about you.  How are you?  Fucking A.  Celebrities all around.  John Wayne Gacy.  How you doing, man?  John Wayne Gacy.  That's quite a look out there, sir.  You probably should have guys a mustache, too.  That's good.  Plenty of young boys to choose from here.  He looks like Gacy.  And he's in the right city. 
[00:14:30]  Sam, give him a mic.  What is he all about?  Yeah, what the hell are you all about?  What?  Do you get the E-Rock school of hair dye?  Yeah.  Or did you steal that from Pesci and JFK?  I got cancer of the neck.  I've had it for years.  Sam will appreciate it.  A little Dolph Ziggler.  Oh, there you go.  Sam, you appreciate that?  It's a wrestler.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, yeah, there you go.  Everyone boos whoever talks.  It's hilarious.  Boo, fuck you.  What's like spouting the cure for AIDS?  You're just like, fuck, shut up. 
[00:15:00]  Why didn't you dye the mustache?  I find it funnier this way.  You're right.  You are absolutely right.  You wait.  Unfortunately, you don't have a hair lip.  That would have been even better.  Nothing better than a mustache with a hair lip.  Looks like you're drawing a line and the pencil broke.  We're not topping that.  Take us out.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Chip is an asshole.  We hate Chip.  We hate Chip.  I think you guys might have just missed this guy who spit his beer out 
[00:15:30]  into his beer and now he's drinking it back again.  Jimmy.  Come on.  Wait, what's going on?  What happened to you?  I was laughing and I spit it back into my cup.  All right, that's fine.  Yeah, that happened.  Shut up.  Just thought I'd help the crowd out.  Yeah, why don't you spit your beer and then shut up?  Oh, E-Rock.  Fucking E-Rock.  Did the crowd meet E-Rock today?  Oh, yeah, they did.  Yeah?  Did they enjoy him?  They were chanting E-Rock.  E-Rock?  Really?  They were chanting E-Rock. 
[00:16:00]  Wow.  Nice.  We'd bring him up, but we're not sure how strong the stage is.  Very good.  But I guess he made it from New York.  We worry about his travel plans.  About everybody, as a matter of fact.  Especially the management, because we really wanted them to attend.  Yeah.  We should have the management come on stage and take a vow.  Not unless we get chicken wire up here.  It's funny.  It's funny.  You asked for them not to be visible.  Answered that he didn't want them visible. 
[00:16:30]  And they are actually in the back.  Well, they're listening.  Just huddled in shame.  Oh, I'm sure they're shaking their head in some fucking disapproval.  What?  I hope he's drunk.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Soon.  Yeah.  Cheers!  Before this whole thing wraps up in hours from now, I would like to maybe do a shot of  Jaeger with a few of you motherfuckers.  I think that would be fun.  I don't think that's going to be a problem.  There's no afternoon shows complete until I flop down drunk face first. 
[00:17:00]  Actually, no evening is complete.  No afternoon, no morning.  All right.  We get it.  I like to drink.  Can we talk to a few of the ladies?  Ah.  We've talked to enough dudes.  Exactly.  Yeah.  A few of the ladies.  She's with a guy.  I don't want to talk to her.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm teasing.  They're raising hands out there.  Hold on.  Danny is running through the crowd to find something with a vagina.  Whoa.  Good luck. 
[00:17:30]  Hello, madam.  You want to talk?  Right here?  Hi.  Hey, how are you?  Hi.  Where are you from?  I'm from Boston.  Boston?  Yeah.  I love Boston girls.  Oh.  They're very territorial here.  Yes, they are.  They really are, man.  Wow.  That's good.  You want to go into your Yankees suck chant now?  We get it.  In church, they're chanting that shit.  Oh, okay.  Well, they do the same thing here, but not with the gusto they do in Boston.  Uh, how'd you get here?  Would you drive? 
[00:18:00]  Well, um, I go to college in Chicago.  I go to Northwestern.  Yeah, all of a sudden, Tree Fort Richard was next to me.  What are you taking in college?  Dick.  I'm kidding, of course.  You look like a wonderful young lady.  Is that your gent next to you?  Um, back here.  My brother.  Oh, right.  Next girl.  No.  Oh, sorry.  Wait, you said your brother.  Totally single. 
[00:18:30]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Yeah.  Um, no, me and my brother are huge fans.  My brother and I.  What a shit school that must be.  Jesus.  So, your brother and yourself.  And myself.  Yeah.  He flew in, just so we could go see you guys.  And his arms were killing him.  I don't know.  That's not what she means, Anthony.  She's implying that they took aircraft. 
[00:19:00]  Thanks, Chip.  Hate literal, Chip.  So, you flew in.  And just for this?  Yeah?  He did.  Sorry.  No, he did.  She goes to school here.  Yeah, I go to school here.  Oh, see, I was all fucked up.  No, I'm sorry.  I'm originally from Boston.  It doesn't matter.  No, it doesn't.  You're so incorrect about that.  I like you, though.  Thank you.  I like you as well.  All right.  Oh, wow.  You guys want to talk to another lady out there?  Hold on a second.  We're still talking to this one now.  Anthony's making headway. 
[00:19:30]  And I want to get to know her, just in case he's too drunk to get an erection, I can step  in.  I wouldn't try to fuck her.  I would just jerk him off and watch.  All right.  Here, everyone, stand by two seconds.  Eith K.  Eke Ide Umberne.  That's Igpe Attenle.  And speaking of that, why don't you find somebody else?  All right.  Oh, there's the Jager.  Oh, come on.  You asked for the Jager, my son.  You didn't ask for Jager.  Holy fucking Chicago-sized shots.  Wow.  Deep dish. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, huh?  Hey, we're doing some shots of Jager, huh?  This will go great with some deep dish pizza.  Hey, right.  That's a fucking...  This is a...  That's a tumbler.  Being a child of the 80s, I think you could realize this is like those Dixie Riddle cups.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  You don't even have the chance.  Of course I'll do it.  That's like breathe.  Breathe.  Yeah.  Well, we have to have somebody smell it. 
[00:20:30]  He's tasting it.  He's the official taster of the OB-ediatry show.  All right, yes.  Keep the cop, everyone.  Yes, keep the cop.  Do you spit news?  He actually does that before Anthony has sex, too.  He just licks the vagina.  All right.  Cheers.  Nice.  Yeah.  Wow.  Bravo.  Bravo.  All right, Doug.  Hey, sir.  Go fuck your mother.  I'm really...  I go like that. 
[00:21:00]  Do you want to talk to another lady or what?  Oh, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Who else we got in the crowd that wants to talk to you?  This lady really wants to talk to you guys.  Yay.  Of course she does.  What's up, guys?  All right.  How are we doing?  Why don't we take a break?  Do you need to eat cake and get some umber names?  That's great.  What?  What's up?  What's your name, madam?  Carolyn.  Thank you for coming, Carolyn.  That's fucking...  Thank you for showing up.  Where are you from?  Where are you from, Carolyn?  Right down the street.  Chicago, maybe.  Right down the street?  Oh, welcome. 
[00:21:30]  That's cool.  Where?  Like how far?  What's the matter?  Like five minutes.  Oh, come on now.  We live in Oakland, so...  Who are you here with?  My husband.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That's it.  We're your biggest fans.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, your man's one of those guys who likes a little junk in that trunk, don't he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  She's showing up.  Love the big ass.  He loves a big ass.  Well, this is Jim Norton.  Ass, ass, titties, titties, ass, and titties. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, shit.  Don't forget the belly.  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus, Opie.  The guy can't just be fucking nice for two seconds.  Get it straight, Opie.  That's a beer belly, my friend.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Fair enough.  That's good.  That just reminds me.  I did a complete non-sequitur.  I didn't know Chris Farley was from Chicago, right?  Yes, he is.  No, it was just a non-sequitur.  I was just saying that he's...  I'm teasing.  Come on now.  Who's saying you look like Chris Farley?  I don't want Gus Hanson to get mad at me over there. 
[00:22:30]  Thanks a lot.  I'm going home now, Ant.  You used to be my favorite.  Thanks.  No, I rule.  No, don't go anywhere.  Well, if she goes home, five more people could get in.  What happened?  What?  Holy shit.  I love drunk Opie.  Opie's drunk.  Opie's drunk.  Opie's drunk. 
[00:23:00]  Opie's drunk.  Holy shit.  Wow, that's brutal.  Wow, that's cool.  All right, Danny Ross, where are you?  Anybody else in the crowd?  We want to let you see hi to.  Is there anybody that wants to talk to the guys?  Oh, is this guy's porno right?  No, no, no.  Also, Danny, hit yourself on the side of the head to change your aspect ratio.  I think it's on stretch before you pick another girl.  I hear.  Believe me, it's not porno.  Oh, man, who's that?  Oh, there we go.  Oh, we know.  There's one of our old favorite people. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, stalker Patty?  Oh, wait a minute.  Who's that?  Brittany?  Oh, hi, Brittany.  Brittany was a cherry dart participant in Cleveland.  Holy shit.  Hey, Brittany.  How you doing, Brittany?  Wow.  I can't even see that far.  She's following us.  Hi, Brittany.  That's pretty cool.  Is Cleveland far from here?  I don't even know.  Cleveland's far from everywhere.  Yeah.  Fucking Twilight Zone City.  That fucking place is.  Four hours.  Four hours.  Yeah, but it's worth it just to get out of Cleveland. 
[00:24:00]  Wow, look at the tits.  Oh, shit.  My mind just flew right out of my mouth before I thought.  Here was my cherry dart partner.  Oh, boy.  Another one with a guy.  Yeah, another one.  Amazing.  Damn.  That was exciting.  Thank you, dudes.  Enough of the dudes.  I'm teasing, of course.  This can't be my personal pussy party.  I understand.  We have to cater to some of the men here.  Are they ready?  Oh, look at him. 
[00:24:30]  He's got a Laszlo Show shirt on.  Love Laszlo.  Where are you from, sir?  Yes, sir.  I'm from San Diego, California.  San Diego?  Yeah.  What are you doing here?  Oh, man.  Another boo.  They hate every city.  Excuse me, guys?  Yes, Danny Ross.  Oh, damn.  Fuck the guy from San Diego.  No, don't.  Wait a minute.  What's your name?  Kelly.  Hi, Kelly.  Are you with the girl behind you?  I am.  This is my cousin, Carla. 
[00:25:00]  Ah.  Your cousin, Carla.  Now, Kelly, do you spell that with a Y or an I with a heart over it?  An I with a little tiny heart over it.  Yay.  Yay.  Wow.  And are you here with a guy friend, too?  I am not.  It's just like you.  All right.  ETH K.  ETH K.  ETH K.  All right.  Do you have a big clink?  Because Jimmy likes.  That's a fair question.  I'm trying to help out with my friend Jimmy.  It's just hanging.  On the bus on the way here, Jimmy was talking about what he likes.  And he said, I like a fat pussy. 
[00:25:30]  And he did this thing that you only do it like cocks.  Like, you don't measure a pussy like this.  You go like a fat pussy, maybe, and go sideways with your fingers open.  But he was like top and bottom.  And then it started turning into this thing going, I love a fat pussy.  And he's like, he's manipulating balls and jerking a dick off in his mouth.  And it's like, it doesn't matter how many times you say pussy, it's a cock.  Jimmy, comment?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  No, I was talking about somebody, and I said she has a fat pussy.  I really do.  First of all, nobody's, this is not an impressive cock on anybody.  That's an impressive fat pussy.  I like a pussy that's a pile.  It should look like somebody took, like, Lady Gaga's meat dress.  I said, she looked like her meat dress piled up on the bank.  He was going to spit his beard out again.  I just had problems.  Jimmy likes a pussy that looks like a steak of a sandwich.  Kelly, where are you from?  Des Moines, Iowa. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, nice.  Welcome.  Country girl.  Yes.  Yeah?  No?  No.  No?  So, do you like it when a guy is talking to you and he does a lot of Radar O'Reilly references?  Oh, I love it.  Who doesn't?  Oh, do you like being diddled with a deformed hand?  Iowa.  Of course he was, Jimmy.  Of course he was.  But maybe that would have worked if the show didn't go off the air in 1982.  So these people weren't born yet.  I know.  Jesus.  So, Kelly, are you single?  I'm not hitting on you. 
[00:27:00]  I'm asking for a reason.  I am not single.  Oh, where's your husband or boyfriend?  Boyfriend's back home.  Okay, he's in Iowa?  That's all that counts.  Yes.  He doesn't like the show, so I came without him.  It's not him.  Yeah, I know.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Yeah.  Most guys with small dicks don't like the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what he's going to like even less than a show?  If you come back with herpes from me.  Oh, would he not like that?  Who gave you this, a guy from that show?  I could trump that with AIDS. 
[00:27:30]  Nice.  You're very pretty.  How old are you?  I'm old.  I'm 30.  Ah, boy, get out of here.  Just turned 30.  You're way too old.  You don't have no kids, do you?  Nope.  All right.  Uncle Paul.  Now.  When are you supposed to bounce in your lap?  I'd go to your house and have nothing to do.  Well, you know, you look very good. 
[00:28:00]  Well, thank you very much.  I'm not saying 30's old, but for me, you know, you've got to chop that in half.  Just about, yeah.  And then take three years off.  Give or take.  Depending on what state.  Right.  Always good.  You do know the laws, right?  Well, state or Thailand.  Anyone else, Danny?  Oh, man.  Unless you're some lovely.  There's lovely ladies everywhere.  There really are, man.  There's a lot more women here than normally should.  I know.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  What did you think?  There's a lovely lady right here.  Oh.  Oh, well.  What do we got here? 
[00:28:30]  Oh.  Hi.  Oh, I like your Chris Jericho hairdo.  My penis does the same thing if you touch it.  Not when I touch it.  Oh, yes.  I swear.  That must be your gentleman friend.  God damn it.  He's a big fucker, too.  God damn it.  I wouldn't mind if you were dating the guy in the wheelchair, because we could just run  away from him.  Yeah, that guy would be a problem.

All right, we can do that.  And what, was she a big hot dog fan?  Wow.  It's actually a sausage restaurant.  Oh.  Wow.  Yes.  Oh, so you landed Abe Froman.  So what did you guys do on your first date, just sit in the car and roll up the windows  and blow hot dog burps at each other? 
[00:30:00]  What a romantic evening.  That's his fetish.  He likes her to blow hot dog burps in his face until he's leaking clear stuff.  Well, that's, uh, are you married or just going out?  Did I miss that?  We're getting married in, uh, 30 days.  Oh.  Wow.  You better get a prenup for, she'll be after that sausage money.  Yeah.  After that sausage blog.  Sausage money.

There's no beheadings going on there.  Yeah.  Real smart.  Where are you going?  Oh, we're going to put on yarmulkes and go to Yemen.  All right.  That's a lovely fucking vacation spot.  Yeah, there's plenty of great cartels we want to visit.  I just got a note from Roland, speaking of food.  Oh, shit.  What did it say?  Let me read it.  I see me.  It just says...

What's a hero's?  I know. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, man.  Okay, so...  That guy looks just like the guy from American History X that killed the kid in the bathroom.  But so does he and he and...  Well, I guess that's it.  We have such a diverse audience.  How many black guys?  I love diversity.  Hair and shaved heads.  We got a black guy over here, too.  All right.  Yeah.  I saw you at the casino last night. 
[00:32:00]  Or not.  I don't know.  So, Roland, we got pizza and cheesecake?  For what, us?  Yeah, we got pizza and Illuminati's and Ellie's cheesecake.  Illuminati's?  Oh, that's good.  Hey, my Italian place.  It's Illuminati's.  Bill Burr don't like it.  Illuminati's?  Oh, fuck.  Illuminati's?  Yeah.  Illuminati's?  Hey, that's where you get the fucking deep dish pizza.  Yeah, mother.  You're cack sucker.  Can we...  Illuminati's?

Hey, can we talk to some people on this side because I feel bad that they had a big sign  in there and they could not actually see my profile.  Jimmy, fuck the left.  I'd love to.  Oh, see?  My political ideology came into play.  See what I did there?  It's called smart humor.  Yuck.  Okay, who do we have here? 
[00:33:00]  Hi, I'm Jennifer.  Hi, Jennifer.  Oh, that name.  Fuck you.  Anthony.  Oh, God.  Just take my money, bitch.  You can...  Anthony, you can call me whatever you want.  Oh.  Oh, hey.

[00:33:30]  That wasn't very nice.  No, it's not.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  We tease here.  Hello, madam.  How are you?  Until I come, then it's real.  I love Jimmy Norton.  Oh, thank you very much.  Oh.  Where are you from, Jennifer?  I'm from Hobart, originally from Chicago.  Oh.  We're from Indiana.  Indiana.  It sounds it.  Originally from Chicago.  Oh, I love your cock.  That's a good one.  Fuck you, Anthony.  Okay.  What do you do for work?  I am a stay-at-home wife. 
[00:34:00]  Stay-at-home wife.  Oh, shit.  A wife?  I like that.  She's another one.  She sounds hammered.  Actually, not really married.  We've been together for 20 years.  Not married.  Wow.  Good for him.  That's common law.  That's a guy who knows how to fucking put things off.  Right.  You definitely have clock tower sniper glasses on.  Yeah.  When are we going to get married?  I'm just waiting for the Cubbies to win the series.  Never.  Oh, shit.  I know.  That's why I said.  Wait, what?  Hey, it's topical. 
[00:34:30]  Why don't we ask the guy, though?  Why 20 years, no marriage?  Why would you ruin the good thing?  Yeah, maybe you're right.  Words of wisdom, Lloyd.  Words of wisdom.  Having a little problems with the old sperm.  I'm waiting for you, Jimmy.  You're waiting for me?  Is there just a slower pace here?  Is that what I'm getting?  You guys are talking like,  bro, I think we are going to get married. 
[00:35:00]  You burned one on the way here, man.  Oh, shit.  You burned one?  A black guy.  Oh, sorry.  It's the Midwest.  I thought it was racist.  Wow, that was awkward.  It was awkward.  Wow.  You okay with that, Soxton?  They're a little too close.  A little close.  Yeah.  They're in the front row, man.  I'm still trying to decompress from the casino last night.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  I'm sorry I did that.  I apologize.  Okay, so you're with somebody.  Are there any...  I'm asking for a reason.  Are there any single women here? 
[00:35:30]  All the single ladies.  All the single ladies.  No, no, no.  I have a contest.  Honestly, it's called,  Who Wants to Earn Some Money Later?  This guy is raising his hand.  This guy is raising his hand.  And Jimmy's not completely disinterested.  We're in Jim Norton's money.  So we have people here.  What's that?  Rent money.  Rent money?  We're looking for girls.  Oh, we have to tell them.  Thank you for the three of the same side.  We're broadcasting live.  If you're listening and you're still working and you want to come down, we're live. 
[00:36:00]  We're at 115 Bourbon Street in Marionette Park.  We have a really good crowd here.  Much better than I thought.  Yeah, absolutely.  But that isn't the note Iraq gave me.  It said,  Can you wrap it up?  I'm starving.  Hey, Iraq.  Come on.  We're doing a show here.  And we have,  What do we have to do today?  Oh, we have some stuff going on.  Well, Iraq is going to be judging the bad breath contest.  Do we have contestants for that?  Yeah.  Depending on,  We actually have contestants that have really bad breath and they're hanging out in the crowd? 
[00:36:30]  The guy who is in front here.  That guy?  Oh, that guy?  Oh, he had the tooth thing going.  West Virginia guy.  Wait, I didn't see his tooth.  He had a bad tooth?  Is he still here?  I hope he's still here.  He had a false front tooth.  Oh, he had a dead tooth.  I hope the possum I ate don't freshen my breath.  Fuck.  All right.  There he is.  Oh, there he is.  All right.  We fucking saved your ass, brah.  We saved you.  Saved your ass, brah.  Hey, Jimmy,  You want to do like a little pre-bed?  Breath contest? 
[00:37:00]  I want E-Rock to smell his dead tooth.  All right.  What happened?  What happened, E-Rock?  What's wrong with E-Rock?  If he's competing, then we've got to get somebody who's not going to participate.  Oh.  No, it's just to get...  You want to cleanse the palate with one of Jimmy's farts?  Who gives a fuck?  It's like sorbet.  We're just farting.  Hold on.  E-Rock, on stage.  On stage.  Bring him up.  Get the guy on stage.  We're going to have the official contest, but why not kick it off and see how bad this  guy's breath is?  Oh, boy.  That's a little difficult.  Oh, shit. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, the crowd is going wild.  No, his name is Lou.  They're just chanting Lou, Lou.  No, they're not.  Hi, buddy.  How are you?  Hold on.  No, no, no.  We're talking to turn around.  Okay, so, okay.  My name's Loren Heffield, and listen.  I swear.  Shut up.  I'm pumped.  He's working on mic like wrestling.  This is like wrestling.  Shut up.  I'm glad.  I'm glad.  Let me tell you something, Brutus.  The barber beats me.  Penny, he's fine.  Let me do it.  Just let me talk.  Oh, it's okay, Kenny.  Let me talk.  He's okay, Kenny. 
[00:38:00]  No.  Penny just doesn't like him to fall.  I'm here to win the Bad Bread Challenge.  All right.  I'm here to win the Bad Bread Challenge.  I got a present for Jim Norton.  Yes, sir.  Oh, shit.  He just pulled his teeth out.  Or his tooth out.  Finally.  That looks like the shrimp I had last night.  Let E-Rock smell that.  No, let E-Rock smell that.  Let E-Rock smell your denture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  E-Rock, take a good whiff.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, man!  The face of the gun.  I told you I'm fucking... 
[00:38:30]  I told you.  That's all I...  I...  Listen, I appreciate you guys coming for me.  Hold on, hold on.  This guy...  I hate to say it, but...  Shut up!  We didn't get it on tape.  I gotta get it on tape.  Oh.  E-Rock, you gotta do it again.  I didn't get it on tape.  All right, smell that again.  E-Rock.  Is it bad?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, you know what's been between that fucking thing and his gums?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  How is it?  Smells like talking cigarettes. 
[00:39:00]  Let me say something.  Let me say something.  I didn't brush my teeth all week for this motherfucker.  All right.  Wow, so you brush more than usual, you say.  Can you tell him to lay off?  I gonna hurt nobody.  Nah, Kenny does that.  It's okay.  He loves you.  Yeah, Kenny...  Well, I tell him to pull out my wedge, because it's...  You're giving him a wedgie, Kenny.  All right.  Yeah, that's good.  Well, thank you, and you'll be involved later.  Let's hopefully do very well.  Dead Tooth Guy.  Dead Tooth Guy, everyone.  West Virginia.  Yeah.  Oh, give him his beer.  I love you, guys. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, we love you, too, don't we?  Don't we?  Not literally.  Figuratively.  Hey, we take a break, because I got to piss badly.  What?  I got to take a leak.  Oh, you got a little hummingbird bladder, don't you?  Yes, I do.  All right, we can take a break.  Yeah, we've been on for 35, 36 minutes.  And the broadcast is only, what, 52 minutes long?  Oh, stop now.  According to management?  Yeah.  Now, we're going to do the contest.  What else do we got going on?  We have some other stuff going on.  Oh, I see a couple of live from the compound T-shirts.  Thank you, guys, for the support.  Wearing a half a swan sticker. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, that's great.  Do we have people that are going to do a chip off the old block today?  What's that?  Yeah.  Do we actually got contestants that are going to try to do the chip?  Yeah.  They didn't really get the part about doing the chip look.  I figured.  Okay, well, that's fine.  But they'll come up and do a chip.  Yeah, we're going to do it.  All right, maybe we'll do that after the break.  Then, oh, Honest Thing You Own.  Did people bring that shit?  Yes.  We got good stuff?  Yes.  And we do have...  Hold on.  Are we going to beat Freeze-Dried Monkey from Philly?  Well, based on the fact that he gave the monkey oral sex afterwards, I don't know for  sure. 
[00:40:30]  But we have good stuff.  Sam is basically saying Chicago sucks.  That's what I heard.  Oh, Sam.  That's what I heard.  You know, Sam.  That's what I heard, man.  That's what I heard, man.  You proved me wrong.  You proved me wrong, man.  Do we know what they brought yet or no?  I know some of the stuff they've brought, not everything.  Did they say it on the air?  No, absolutely not.  Now, do they want to pawn it or sell it?  Is there a possibility that we could beat the Freeze-Dried Monkey Hummer thing?  We have some very odd things here.  Oh, cool.  I just got a text from CM Punk who said, I'm headed your way for shenanigans. 
[00:41:00]  Oh!  Fuck, CM Punk.  Wow.  You're in the area.  Come on by.  Where are we?  115 Bourbon Street.  115 Bourbon Street, Marionette Park.  Yes.  We also have, oh, we have that, which is a surprise.  Oh, we got a couple of, let's just say a couple of musical surprises that you might enjoy.  All right.  Hey, man, we're live in Chicago.  We'll be back in a few minutes.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, guys. 
[00:41:30]  Chicago.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is live from Chicago.  Chicago.  More O&A in moments.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Live from Chicago.  Are we back?  I think we're back live in Chicago.  115 Bourbon Street, Marionette Park in Chicago.  Yeah.  Wow.  We just lost our fucking hearing with that.  Yeah, that was very loud.  I don't know if anyone else understands that, so we'll just move on.  Anyway. 
[00:42:00]  Now, what we're going to do, I guess, I hope you're right.  You want to do the chip?  Yeah, we should see if anyone else could do the chip impression.  Chip off the old block.  Chip off the old block.  Exactly.  Sam?  Do we have contestants for this?  Jimmy's ass has died.  It just completely perished, and it's rotting away.  It's been exhumed.  Big crowd's excited.  That's my excitement coming out.  Do you want the chips on stage?  Yeah, we have that chip.  We're talking about Jimmy's farts for a second.  You got it.  Oh, God. 
[00:42:30]  That didn't make the air.  Terrible.  It's like a silent movie up here.  We're all, like, fanning your farts, and everyone's cracking up.  You all right?  Yeah, I feel good.  You feel good?  Never better, actually.  You feel good about the broadcast?  I love the broadcast so far.  All right, good.  We got a good crowd.  Good.  My farts are putrid, and I'm hoping to get...  It won't fucking go away.  Stop it.  Fuck, man.  They are so bad.  Thank you.  Did we bring the fart mask, Danny?  It does.  No, we didn't bring the fart mask.  You smell it?  Fuck.  It's going into the fucking crowd. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Well, you're welcome.  This is crazy.  You want it?  It's a 3-D radio broadcast.  We got to bring the fart mask next broadcast.  Note to self.  All right.  Sam, we got contestants for Chip Off the Old Block.  Yeah.  Now, do we have anything to give the winner?  Because it's just basically a judgment call by us three.  Someone who could do a good chip impression.  What do we have for them?  I think we're going to kick them in the groin.  No problem.  What is it?  Exhibition?  Yeah.  This is for honor. 
[00:43:30]  What do you mean for honor?  That stinks.  No one can hear you.  All right.  That's good.  Sam, call me.  I know.  We can hear you, Sam.  Okay.  We can hear you, Sam.  It's for honor.  Honor stinks.  Don't we have something to give them?  These guys want cash.  What do we have for the chip?  How much?  For the best chip?  Whoa.  Well, according to Travis, we have $500 for the best chip.  $500.  Wow.  $500.  That's a lot of cake right there.  Honor can suck my dick.  $500 cash.  Gets fucked and the chip impression is going.  By the way, I loved you when Edward Norton beat you up in Fight Club. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  What's your name, sir?  Honor.  My name is Kenny.  Where are you from, Kenny?  I'm from Champaign, Illinois.  Champaign?  Oh, you must be thirsty.  I'm really thirsty, Chippo.  Oh, shit.  Okay, now you...  Come back.  You have to do this to the crowd so they can see it, but I want to see the face, too.  I'm going to look at the face.  All right.  Here's his chip impression.  Right?  Something not funny.  Okay.  All right. 
[00:44:30]  Go ahead, sir.  Let's...  Good face.  Bourbon Street?  What about Bourbon Street or something?  Holy shit.  And the crowd, their approval.  What the fuck was that shit?  Shut up, Chippo.  No, it was...  It wasn't bad, but it was a little too...  It sounded like stalker Chip.  Like, Chip has it...  Do it again. 
[00:45:00]  One more time.  Hold on.  Yeah, sir, you got to shut up, sir.  Hold on.  Well, listen, the guy with the aviator glasses and dumpster breath.  Hold on.  We're doing something.  How does one guy make it about himself?  It is amazing.  There's 500 people here.  We know one person.  Jesus.  All right.  Do your impression again.  Okay.  I want to hear it through this, like...  Yeah.  One more time.  Oh, fucking Bourbon Street.  What about...  Oh. 
[00:45:30]  What about Bourbon Street?  Wait.  You prepared one line?  Yes, sir.  It's Forrest Chip.  She had got the cancer or something.  It was AIDS.  Oh, yeah.  I buried her under a tree.  Fuck her.  That was Jenny.  So, all right.  Well, I guess we should do a couple more.  Maybe we can let the crowd vote.  I'm happy to let the crowd vote.  I think it's safe to say this guy is...  Well, he's...  I'd say it to say he's a contestant.  Okay.  Fair.  Fair.  I mean, let's be fair here. 
[00:46:00]  You never know.  Who's our next contestant?  All right.  Yeah.  Let's give that a try once.  Yeah.  It's a $500 prize for the best chip impression.  It's a lot of cash.  Yeah.  It's a lot of cash.  It's a lot of cash.  Are you coming up?  Yes.  You got to come up.  He's Dr. Octopus.  Come up.  What the fuck?  Yes.  Oh, man.  All right.  That's a cool shirt.  It almost looks like Keith to come.  Steve C.  A little bit.  A little tribute to Steve C.  Tribute to Steve C.  Yes.  My sleeves are on fire.  Yes.  Oh, banana. 
[00:46:30]  Steve C's looking down on us all right now and hating us.  What's your name, first of all?  Steve.  I'm from...  Oh, wow.  Steve from Chicago.  All right.  Hey there, Steve.  All right.  Well, I'm standing under this ring.  When am I at a Johnny Cash concert or something?  Is it a ring of fire?  That wasn't...  That was actually a better Travolta.  Hey, it's John Travolta, Chip.  I don't think Mr. Carter or something. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  Why don't you suck my dick or something, then, if I'm John Travolta?  Hey, look.  I'm bored with it, all right?  All right?  Hey, grease.  It actually sounded like, hey, I'm Chipper.  I'm warning you.  My eyes are going crazy.  All right.  You're going crazy over here.  All right.  So we have the first two chips.  Wow, this is going swimmingly.  I'm sure people...  If you're Rodney King.  That's not funny.  He passed away.  Oh, Chip.  Who do we got next, Sam? 
[00:47:30]  This guy.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Jesus.  Iraq.  What's up?  Big boy.  I believe maybe you need good new American hair, too.  Really spanky on the top.  Look like a hedgehog.  I got something on this guy, believe it or not.  What?  He's the guy I talked about on Twitter a couple days ago.  He put off his brain surgery to see us.  What an asshole.  Wow. 
[00:48:00]  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  What an idiot.  Believe me, you're not alone in this room.  Wait, why the brain surgery, though?  Yeah, why the brain...  What's going on with you?  Talk to the mic.  No, talk to the...  I know you don't think well right now, but talk to the mic, please.  I got a tumor behind my left eye.  It's not the tumor.  Yeah.  I guess it is.  I'm going to hurt you red.  Wow.  Sorry, that's a great Santini tumor.  Okay.  So what are they going to do?  Like, where are they cutting you and all that?  Maybe take it out, Opie?  No, I understand that, but how?  They're going up... 
[00:48:30]  They're going...  They're talking to the mic.  They're going up under my lip and up through there.  Oh, my God.  Like cocks in Jimmy's mouth.  Right.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wait a minute.  That's not polite, Anthony.  Wow, we got mean Anthony tonight.  I love it.  It's awkward.  No, I'm not.  It's really...  What's that for?  I'm an angry drunk, which means I'm angry all the time.  Oh, you spilled something?  I didn't.  Opie hit the table twice and my drink spilled.  Come on, let's fucking do this or something.  Oh.  Harvey Fire Chip, fucking cocksuckers.  Look at this fucking guy. 
[00:49:00]  Or that one.  You blew up brain surgery for this, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  How come you don't have a Threema?  Yeah.  I don't know, right?  Fuck.  Oh, the master.  Wow.  No, go ahead.  You go ahead.  I got up this morning and my mother was like, Chip, Chip, you better dress up good because  it's going to be on the radio.  And I was like, radio?  Is that like Ronnie James Dio's brother or something?  Oh, man.  That's good.  It's almost Beavis and Butthead. 
[00:49:30]  That was pretty good, though, because the radio and the Ronnie Dio, I got it.  It was okay.  Well, I hope you take care of that George Harriton.  Can I, hold on.  Can I point out the genius of Anthony?  Oh, please.  He took brain cancer and obesity and put them together in a topical reference.  He thought of a guy who had brain cancer and died of it, and he could make a fat joke.  That was very fucking amazing. 
[00:50:00]  Thank you.  Jim Norton.  Why the 11.59 tattoo, by the way?  Uh-oh.  That's how many minutes he has to live.  All right.  That's terrible.  I'm kidding.  What are you going to say next?  That's his weight?  I'm sorry.  Never, Jimmy.  It's almost lunchtime.  It always reminds me.  Why the 11.59?  Okay, it's Chip Ruth.  I love playing for the Yankees or something.  It's like living in the moment stuff.  Like, time is almost up, yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  No, you'll be fine, right?  You're supposed to be okay? 
[00:50:30]  With fucking Norton's farts, I might not make it this day.  That's true.  Dude, I hope you're okay, but if that did affect you and you died on the stage, I would  be a legend in comedy.  Comedian kills an ill man with farts.  Well, good luck, man.  We hope you're okay.  Yeah, really.  For real.  Is it benign or malignant?  Is it pretend?  God damn, he took a line.  It's benign.  Oh, John Benign Ramsey or something.  I don't know.  You guys can run me. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, that's not funny.  She passed away.  That's very sad.  Sam, we got another contestant.  Oh, Sam.  Why do you say that?  I don't know, because you're an asshole.  Yeah, exactly.  She got angry anything today.  Jesus.  No one's safe.  All right.  Who do we got?  What's your name, bro?  My name's Alex.  Hi, Alex.  Hi, Alex.  Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's up, Alex?  Where are you from?  I'm from Chicago.  All right.  Oh.  Bobby Hill. 
[00:51:30]  What do you do for a living?  I work out of my house.  I work out of my house.  I work out of my house.  Oh.  All right.  Nice and vague.  I picked up a drug dealer.  Yeah, what do you do?  I write blogs.  We all work.  We all work.  Yeah, I know.  It's a shit job.  You know, this guy's just an asshole, and I write a blog, so that means it's true.  Oh, he's a nice guy.  What do you do besides PSA for Down syndrome?  What do you think?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  He looks a little fat.  Now it's mean Jimmy.  I was kidding.  I didn't mean that.  That's okay.  So what Jimmy said was, what do you do? 
[00:52:00]  Teasing.  I'm telling you what.  Oh, man, that was pretty good.  That was good.  What do you do, sir?  It's got great, that velvet hair.  That's nice.  Thanks.  I do my own hair.  It looks good, man.  Thank you.  Full head.  All right.  You got a chip impression?  No.  What?  All right.  Okay.  I thought the contest was a look-alike, not a...  Oh, you know something?  He was asked to kind of have a chip look to him.  Yeah, but you have to do the voice, too.  You got to do the voice, too.  Let's try the voice, but do the face. 
[00:52:30]  And try the voice.  Good radio.  Show the audience.  Yeah, good radio.  Exactly.  Yeah, I know, right?  Do the face.  Great radio.  Right?  He's not wrong.  If I could describe what he looked like, picture trying to take a shit after a lot of fiber.  Stop playing with yourself.  Yes, sir.  They're implying that your hands are in your khaki shorts and you're playing pocket pool.  Yeah, they think you're right.  Oh, you're playing with yourself.  I'm nervous.  Are you?  All right.  Do it a little bit.  All right.  Do it, Chip.  What the hell?  Go ahead. 
[00:53:00]  Face the crowd.  Let the crowd see you, man.  They're supportive.  Fuck you!  Oh, that always helps.  Yeah, right?  Say fuck you to the huge crowd.  Woo!  And they go, yeah, well, he got us.  I've got nothing.  Obviously.  I just, I don't know.  I just got nothing.  I think we found a winner.  You suck.  You suck. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, shit.  That sounded like Chip J. Bullock.  All right.  You suck!  You suck!  You suck!  You suck!  What a waste of time.  All contrast thoughts.  Sam, is that it?  It's a slow burn.  The thing is, ever since $500 we've put on the line, everybody now does a Chip and Proud.  Is that Coke Logic?  Coke Logic!  Holy shit!  Coke Logic!  It's fucking Coke Logic.  Come on up here.  Coke Logic has been doing animations for the Opie and Anthony show for fucking years. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, I know.  What if you think he's a bunch of Pepsi products or something?  This dude is, uh, this dude is very talented and rarely leaves his house.  Yeah, he's a shut-in.  He kind of is a shut-in.  Oh.  Oh.  What's up, Coke Logic?  Make him stand right here.  Sorry to climb up here.  There's a good douchebag in a wheelchair.  Oh!  I didn't fucking climb around him.  Wait, turn around.  What should I do?  Well, turn around so people can see me. 
[00:54:30]  Turn around.  Hey, what's up, Chicago?  What the fuck is up?  This guy, uh, loves animations, drinking, and I think Pearl Jam, right?  I love Pearl Jam, animation, and the Opie and Anthony show.  And drinking.  Let's not forget the drinking part.  And taking the mic away from Sam Roberts, which gives me free control to just say anything  I want.  He really did just grab the mic.  Oh, wow.  Bad, right?  Right?  Right, Danny?  Jimmy just took out the whole front row with a fart. 
[00:55:00]  Jimmy walked to the front of the stage and told me he was going to fart, and he did.  And the whole crowd is waving.  It's like the wave.  But they're horrified.  It stopped me dead in my tracks.  Jimmy, for the next one, you've got to go in the middle of the crowd.  I want to see everyone just fart.  Oh, Jimmy, you should.  Just go right into the crowd and fart.  I want to see what happens.  No, because that would be embarrassing.  Coke Lodge, you got anything else before your moment is over?  Oh, shit.  What do you got? 
[00:55:30]  It looks like you brought gifts.  Well, not gifts.  That happens at Christmas time, and you know I'm always good.  Even if it's a Rich Voss signed CD that is given away on the after show.  So, what I have...  I think he's losing the crowd.  RichVoss.com!  You're losing the crowd.  You're losing the crowd.  What I have is a look for Chip Chipperson.  Oh, oh.  Like a mullet?  That is a hat with a mullet. 
[00:56:00]  Hey, you're ripping me off.  All right, look, I need a haircut.  I understand.  And a look.  If I can get this fucking thing going here.  Did that hair come off a human being?  I'm a little worried here.  This is my...  This is perfect for the radio, by the way.  I have a look for Chip Chipperson.  Oh, shit.  He already has the animation for Chip.  Oh, man.  That's very good.  It's not radio, but it really looks like a good version of Chip.  That's pretty fucking good.  And now that he's wearing the actual shit that's in the animation, this might be the... 
[00:56:30]  That is...  Did you see this?  The Chippa look.  Wow.  Fuck.  No one's going to beat that.  We should fucking go to break or something.  Oh, no, no.  What?  No.  Oh, man.  It just came back.  Chip, you like that?  I like your Harry Pot roast glasses.  All right.  You get it.  I fucking...  It feels cool, man.  You like it?  Yeah.  You like your long hair like that?  Fucking A.  Fucking A, call me a...  Notice the brim is out of the way of the expressions. 
[00:57:00]  And it's green with envy.  Oh, it's green with envy.  He caught up everything.  He caught up everything.  He did think of stuff.  Hey, Chip, what does the hat actually say?  I don't know.  I can't read it.  What are my eyes up there or something?  Oh, go to break.  Oh, no, no, no.  Please don't do that.  Oh, that's good.  I love watching another functional alcoholic.  That's great.  We'll be doing some drinking, man.  Oh, we have been.  Oh, I have been as well. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, that's what I was getting at, actually.  Fist it.  All right.  Boom.  Coke Logic.  Always a pleasure.  Coke Logic, everyone.  That's a good one, right?  Very good.  This does some great shit for the O&A show.  Thank you, Coke Logic.  And you might have came up with the Chip look.  I don't know.  The hat says Barbista and Babe, and it's a coffee cup, and it says,  Caution, contents extremely hot.  Ah, I see.  Because Chip is...  If they're hot, it must be sick fucking puppy CDs.  Oh, shit.  No one likes that band. 
[00:58:00]  Sam, is that it?  Do we have any more?  We could literally do this for the rest of the show.  Well, we don't have any.  All righty.  What else are we doing?  All right.  A couple more.  Oh.  We do have $500, though.  Oh, man.  All right, cool.  Farley Reincarnated.  Oh, shit.  Right there.  Brian Dennehy, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, man.  How you doing?  Oh, my God.  What's your name and where you're from?  John from Chicago.  Chicago.  Welcome.  You are a character actor. 
[00:58:30]  You really look like 20 different people I've seen.  Yeah.  This guy is in television.  He looks like the...  He is Chicago.  Oh, there you go.  He looks like the cop in Dog Day Afternoon.  Just keep us all straight.  Just keep us all straight.  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  John from Chicago.  All right, John.  What do you do here?  I am a carpenter.  All right?  All right.  John's a fucking man's man.  All right.  Yeah.  What, you framing out a house?  Yeah.  What, you doing the sheet rock down at the fucking McDonald's? 
[00:59:00]  On the high rise.  On the high rise?  What, you guys setting up some scaffolding?  Scaffling it is.  Yeah, of course.  Scaffling it is.  I love a real man.  Real big man.  Do you do Chris Farley?  I almost feel like you can.  Really?  You do Chris Farley?  In a van down by the river.  I guess you don't.  Face the audience.  Wait.  John, you've got to face the crowd.  They can see you.  They have to see your face because it's not just about us.  Yes.  Let the crowd see you.  We're really going to try this again?  Smoking dude ain't going to do nothing for you. 
[00:59:30]  You know what?  All right.  That was bad.  That was bad.  You're going to end up in a van down by the river.  See, the face really makes it.  Again, for radio.  And you want to do Chip, too?  I do Chip.  All right.  Face the crowd and let them see.  I do Chip.  I do Chip.  Can I talk to the girl from New York? 
[01:00:00]  Chip Farley.  Oh, my God.  Chip Farley.  That's also his Reagan.  It's a garbage.  Chip, get her down that wall.  Do you know the difference between a blowjob and a ham sandwich?  Chip, tell yourself.  I know the difference.  What is it, Chip?  Well, a ham sandwich.  I want to go out for a ham sandwich.  All right, Chip.  We get it.  Why would you talk over there?  I thought you meant me.  All right.  What's the difference between...  No, what's the difference? 
[01:00:30]  No one heard it.  Yeah, what's the joke, Biff Cannon?  Yeah.  What was the...  No?  Forget it.  I've been fooled before.  Take your goddamn hands off.  You all right?  All right, let's hear it for this guy.  Yeah, he did a nice job.  This guy.  You know someone's memorable when you call him this guy.  Now, miss, what are you trying to...  This lady's trying to tell me something.  He does Chip good?  Who is he to you? 
[01:01:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know today.  What are you lying?  Is that...  All right, let's try it.  Get down there with the legs.  Sam, what's the matter?  You a big star now?  You can't go into the crowd?  Yeah, who's this pretty girl?  Let's try it.  Let's try it.  Where's your boyfriend, miss?  Oh, good.  All right.  Now, me and Jimmy are going to be like lions and fight.  Why would we be lying?  I'll tell the truth.  Why don't I get booed immediately?  For your tablecloth shirt, perhaps.  He goes, why did I get booed immediately?  You are out of the way. 
[01:01:30]  I have a test pattern.  All right, what's your name?  Where are you from?  Jordan Boyle from Philadelphia.  Now I live in Chicago.  Nice.  There you go.  Philly.  Represented.  Philly to Chicago.  Let's hear your chip.  Huh?  Tablecloth shirt.  Is that what you said?  I didn't say that.  It's like a picnic table or something.  Oh.  It's like my mother said.  My mother said, Chip, but you need to tell me every once in a while.  You need to do something twice.  You get a picnic table or you have a shirt.  You know, what are you going to say? 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  I'm not.  Wow.  Sounds just like me.  Not.  Holy shit.  Did you like that, Bob Kelly?  What did you think?  Yeah, don't turn around.  Look for somebody.  It's you, motherfucker.  It is you.  I love that the guy is like, hey.  He's like, I want to laugh, too.  Where is the asshole?  Oh, shit.  It's me.  That was hilarious.  He was praying, though.  You can see on his face.  That's not me.  Oh, shit. 
[01:02:30]  It's me.  You know what, dude?  I don't have a bandolier.  Yeah, I don't got a bandolier.  I don't have a bandolier.  But I'm here with my shirt.  Boom.  I'm standing front row.  I'm talking to Chicago.  I bought you a shot that Anthony Spinner did.  No, Anthony did the shot.  No, Anthony did the shot.  No, that one spilled.  Oh, by the way, Anthony needs another shot of Jägermeister.  Oh, there it is, Anthony.  I might do another one.  All right.  So we have a few chips.  You spitting this?  Sam, we got one more?  Let's do one more chip.  There's got to be another chip. 
[01:03:00]  I'm praying we can salvage this.  All right.  Yeah, right?  All right.  Who's this?  Name and where you're from, brother?  Jeff from Chicago Midway.  Welcome, Jeff.  All right.  Chicago Midway.  Hey, Chicago Midway.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that good?  I think it's good.  Let's hear your trick.  All right, folks.  You got one of those guinea horns?  I do.  Do you have a fucking guinea horse?  I got one of those hats, too, by the way.  Hey, I got a hat.  I got a guinea horn.  Yeah, he's real.  I'm a fucking Italian from Chicago, you cuck. 
[01:03:30]  What do you got there?  You are a fucking guinea.  I am.  I know.  All that shit.  My last name's Underhill, though, so what the hell?  Oh, he's got the...  Yeah, but when he came from Italy, it was Underhilliani.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Underhill.  Oh, anyway.  Hey, there's...  Oh, fuck.  I think Chippa...  Hold on.  Before I go off balls, I swing and miss that.  Chippa.  Jesus, Chippa.  All right.  Where's your moment, finally?  Underhill, I was like, I knew I had something. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  All right.  All right, so Chippa's been, you know, studying up on his science and whatnot, and NASA just sent  the Curiosity to Mars.  What's next?  They're going to send, like, by Curiosity to explore Uranus or something?  Double gun, baby.  Double gun.  Hey, nobody can hear the fucking snort.  I can do the snort.  Oh.  I did the snort.  No one's done the snort.  You're like a triple threat or a quadruple one or something. 
[01:04:30]  What are we in?  What are we in?  We're in Illinois.  Is everyone, like, sick or something?  Oh, shit.  Chippa's not his man.  He's not stopping.  Hey, Chicago.

Chippa's getting his ass kicked.  Oh, man.  Come on, Chipp.  He's owning you.  Yeah, well, you got, like, khaki shorts on.  How come...  Yeah, it's because I shop at cold.  Because that's the only cold that fit or something.

He's owning you, Chipp.  What are you going to talk like this all the time?  What are you going to be like?  I don't know.  My mother told me, don't use that type of language, Chippa.  I'm just trying to sound like you.  I'm not you.  I'm not you.  What's the V stand for?  A big hat or something?  Yeah.  That's right.  This is fucking...  Behind or something.  This is embarrassing. 
[01:06:30]  Chippa, you're embarrassing everybody.  Oh, yeah?  Maybe I could put a C hat on, and then we could be BC like we're before Christ.  Whoa!  Oh, I'm sorry.  Was that too religious?  Poor Chipp.  Oh, that was a...  That was fucking fantastic.  I think, Chipp...  Sam, I think we got a winner.  Holy shit.  I think we got a winner, right?  Well, so to speak.  I mean...  Winner's a loose term.  All right, what do you guys think?  Should we line them up and see what we're doing? 
[01:07:00]  I don't even think we need to fucking line them up.  I like this guy.  This guy's got it.  Holy shit.  You just won $500.  Courtesy, the opening and Anthony's showing.  I guess $115.  Thank you very much.  Very good.  That was very good.  Yeah, get a little picture with...  The photographer guy is a complete pain in the ass.  By the way, CM...  Oh my God, what is this?

You think the ones  that do are going  to show their badges?  But he's kind of right.  They probably all do stink.  Oh, my God.  I just said that.  Oh, we're teasing,  of course.  Are you with that white woman?  Oh, sorry.  I was ready to call security.  And I was ready  to jerk off.  They call me  old 1940s Anthony. 
[01:18:30]  You know,  I was born.  And, you know,  he could be Obama's son.  You know,  if I had a son,  he'd look like you.  Look just like you, sir.  All right.  Oh, come on.  Get that guy  an iced tea.  Hold on.  All right.  We get it.  Hold on.  Instead of calling me crazy,  is there any women  that want to like,  I don't know,  any women  waffling a little bit  tonight?  This ain't going to happen.  Oh, B's drunk.  Well, not really.  Oh, B's drunk. 
[01:19:00]  I'll play a lot.  Oh, B's drunk.  All right.  Look, we need  the contestants  and the nose,  E-Rock,  to get up here  and start judging  this bad breath contest.  My God.  Oh, there you are,  E-Rock.  Hi, E-Rock.  I didn't see.  I should have known  because the stage  was leaning to the right.  Leaning to the right.  The stage was  leaning to the right.  My throat hurts  from singing  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, big old fatso.  He's on the stage.  He's such an awesome.  Wanted to take 
[01:19:30]  a later flight.  Big old.  Jimmy, you didn't realize  there was a lot  of Mimi Beardsleys  in that song, huh?  There was a lot  of Mimi Beardsleys  in that song, Jimmy.  I couldn't believe  how many Mimi Beardsleys  in a row  they wanted  a sweet boy to sing.  There might have been  20 too many.  Oh, it was endless.  Holy fuck.  I bought it, Mimi Beardsley.  I heard you, Mimi Beardsley.  I read it.  I read it.  It's about Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, shit.  Jesus Christ.  You're not going  to hurt us, sir, are you?  I think your shirt's  like black with envy.  Oh, it's a different color. 
[01:20:00]  I had a 50-50 shot.  Yeah, green.  What is that?  The green Hornet  sweatshirt that he wears  when it's chilly  or something?  Oh, shit, fuck.  Too long.  All right, what's your name, sir?  My name's Michael.  I'm from Chicago.  Face the audience  a little bit, Michael.  What are you doing?  Michael's from Chicago.  Your teeth look very white,  so I would imagine  your breath isn't that bad.  You didn't brush  your teeth for a while,  or what did you do?  Yeah, but I've also  been smoking and drinking,  so if I just smell  like alcohol and cigarettes  right now, I apologize.  Way to give it away.  You're, uh, okay. 
[01:20:30]  Iraq is the sole judge of this.  Yeah, Iraq is the judge,  and there's a $500 cash prize.  That's a lot, so if you want  to, you know,  bop for shit in the toilet  and then come back,  feel free.  You've got some time.  All right.  All righty.  Iraq?  Iraq, please.  Step up.  Let's go, Iraq.  And, sir, just breathe  slowly, steadily  right on his nose.  You've probably taken  a lot of D.W.E. tests  in your life.  Do it the same way.  Yes.  Right on his nose.  Iraq, a nice, uh, breath in. 
[01:21:00]  Now he's your troll.  Hey, Matt.  Where's he going?  Oh, no.  Oh, Iraq laughs at you, sir.  I think you could get  a date with the guy,  never mind offending him.  Holy shit, I think he liked it.  That was a little too close.  He's very cuddly.  Aw.  You want to hug Iraq?  Iraq, give him a hug.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  That's adorable.  Wow, he does like it.  You know what?  He must have seen  that Facebook picture  where you're looking  with your bedroom eyes.  All right, come here.  Yeah, I'm married,  but I'm looking. 
[01:21:30]  Why don't you tell us  to shut up?  Why don't you tell us  to shut up?  Yeah.  Why don't you come back here  and shut up?  Fucking told them.  What's him?  Even in front of this crowd,  do you know how confident  he was during the pre-show?  Oh, shit.  So confident.  He rocked her in the pre-show?  And now he won't say a word.  It's so weird how that happened.  We hate confident he rocked.  Actually, we just hate he rocked.  That's another way it goes.  All right, so far this contest.  That guy was nothing.  Oh, this guy.  All right.  Where are you from? 
[01:22:00]  Hi, I'm Steve from Chicago.  Ah, Steve from Chicago.  I like eating a lot of bratwurst,  some of that fucking deep dish pizza.  Yeah, I put on an accent,  but I don't really got stuff.  No, you don't get stuff.  Good work.  No feedback at all.  Oh, wow.  This guy is fucking...  What an asshole.  I like this guy.  And did you do anything special  to make your breath heinous?  I am related to my mother.  Oh. 
[01:22:30]  In what way?  Oh.  What does that mean?  Maybe mommy stinks.  Yeah, I don't really know  what that means either.  Do you not like your mommy?  Unfortunately...  All of a sudden,  I just got this vision  of oral sex with her.  Oh!  Ah, come on.  A pooner breath.  Why don't you like your mom?  Well, I love her.  She's great,  but she fell on her head in 92  and hasn't had a sense of smell since.  She fell on her head,  no sense of smell.  Since 92.  Did she fall on her head,  or did she fall on your dad's knuckles?  I dropped.  Oh, wow.  Hey, you never know. 
[01:23:00]  That is a good question.  She popped during the fucking Bears game.  Fuck that pussy.  Oh, man.  She was drinking during the Bears game.  She lost her sense of smell forever.  Lost her sense of smell for the last 20 years.  Wow.  20 years.  The bitch smells terrible.  She doesn't know?  She smells awful.  She doesn't know it.  She's watching around smiling.  That must be great.  Get on with it.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, all right.  Breathe into Iraq.  Iraq, if you would step right up.  You ready for this again? 
[01:23:30]  Breathe slowly and steadily  right into Iraq's schnout.  Hi, Iraq.  How are you?  There's nothing there.  Nothing.  Wow, we got a bunch of clean mouths here.  This contest.  Is that a dentine commercialist button?  Get off our stage.  Get out of here with your hygiene.  I don't think it did.  Yeah, we're mad because he has good blood.  Get out of here with your self-respect.  You no-smelling mother, motherfucker.  Sam, we got one more contestant. 
[01:24:00]  So far, this is a bust.  Yeah, this guy.  Dude, all it has to be is one person that stinks.  Oh, this guy is actually putting a finger down his throat.  Oh, yeah.  All right, this guy's a problem.  A very big dude.  Well, he's liking a compound show, so he obviously likes a show that stinks.  Oh, shit.  Oh, he just puked.  He just stuck his fingers down his throat.  He puked in a cup.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Iraq's coming over now.  He's going to breathe in Iraq's face.  Oh, Iraq's throwing up.  Iraq's burning.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The catastrophe. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, the humanity.  Don't kill him, Iraq.  Oh, he's throwing up bile in a cup.  Ah, Iraq.  Iraq's throwing up now.  Ah.  All right, wait a minute.  What happened?  Wait, what happened?  Oh, the guy's puking.  He made Iraq puke.  He's licking bile off his fingers.  This is terrible.  Iraq's not going to be...  He's not being a good judge.  You're not being a good judge.  Shut the fuck up. 
[01:25:00]  He puked in my face.  You're not being a good judge.  You're not being a good judge.  All right, here we go.  Make it official.  Make it official.  So far, he's in the lead.  Yes.  So far, he's in the lead, Iraq said.  He put his fingers down his throat.  He puked up this viscous, brown fucking fluid.  One more time.  Um, into a cup.  One more time.  One more time.  Wait, hold on.  One more time.  Wait, wait, wait.  Right up front.  Right up front.  Wait, let him puke into a cup.  And then maybe if we want to get somebody else to smell that at the end, we can do that. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, there's a good idea.  You're welcome.  Oh, he's puking.  Iraq, everyone's looking for...  Oh, everyone's looking for their photo.  Oh, he's going to play himself.  One more time.  Very biley puke he's got there.  He's a very tall, big guy.  One more time, Iraq.  Oh, that reminds me.  Could someone get me a mudslide?  Bestgaming.com fuck B-man.  Oh, all right.  Hey, wait, wait, wait.  One more time, Iraq.  Now breathe into Iraq's face.  Breathe into Iraq's face.  No, let Iraq smell the cup. 
[01:26:00]  Let Iraq smell the cup.  Oh.  Iraq's dry heaving.  He's dry heaving.  Oh, God damn.  Iraq, look at the cup and...  Iraq's in Iraq.  Holy shit.  Oh, Iraq.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Oh, Iraq.  Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq.  If only you could make that a habit, maybe you'd be human weight. 
[01:26:30]  Move that cup down on the floor.  What do you guys think of that, huh?  Wow.  Sam.  Hey, Sam.  Hey, Sam.  Smell that cup.  How bad does that smell?  Just tell me if it's bad or not.  Smell it.  Just smell it.  All right, Sam, give it a sniff.  Give it a sniff.  Oh, Sam's dry heaving.  Oh, he's dry heaving.  Oh, come on.  How bad could it be?  They don't like bile-y... 
[01:27:00]  No, no, no.  I swear to God, I'll shoot you.  Put it on toast like apple butter.  No!  I hope we made it like a...  Wait, you'll do it?  Wait, we got some of those.  We got some more.  Let's do some more bad breath.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Smell it.  What do you need?  Get up on stage.  Get up on stage.  Do it before you... 
[01:27:30]  This motherfucker wants to drink it.  No, no.  He's going to drink it.  Go ahead.  He's going to drink this guy's puke.  He's going to drink this guy's puke.  He's going to drink this guy's puke.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  He drank it!  Oh, my God!  He drank the puke.  Oh, my God!  Now, E-Rock, you guys smell his breath.  Ha, ha.  We did it before you knew.  Oh, my God.  It's only fair.  Oh, they came out from the back room.  I saw them. 
[01:28:00]  What?  They came out from the back.  Ha, ha.  We beat you.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  We beat you.  Management was trying to shut that down.  There we go.  Just so you know.  There's fucking lawyers with subpoenas trying to serve us right now.  All right, E-Rock, so this guy drank the puke.  Now, you smell his breath.  It's only fair.  E-Rock, he smells breath.  Oh!  Not as bad as the original puke guy, right?  All right.  All right.  No.  Holy shit.  That guy should get something.  What's his name?  Oh, they're getting a sign of release. 
[01:28:30]  Yes, a sign of release.  If you get AIDS, you probably came to see the show.  If you get AIDS, you probably came to see.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  That guy's got some constitution.  That's brutal.  Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny!  Kenny!  Ah, you guys.  Ah, they love Club Soda Kenny.  You guys, we're going to take a very quick break, I promise.  Don't go anywhere.  And then we've got to.  No, this guy says no, Opie.  But we've got no surprise for you right around the corner. 
[01:29:00]  Ooh.  And it's a good surprise.  And are we going to announce the winner after the break?  I think it's that guy.  Wait, can I ask you?  Is it that guy or the first guy who puked or the guy who drank the guy's puke?  I forgot the first guy.  Can I ask you something, though?  Are we taking a break because we're going to get yelled at?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Do we have any more contestants, though?  Any more contestants?  Oh, man.  Wait, we've got another bad breath guy right here.  Yeah.  Oh, what do you got in your mouth?  Bring him up.  E-Rock.  You know, we're not going to take a break.  Oh, man.  Let him come up here.  Go to the garden.  Give me!  Don't smoke.  Yeah, make sure his mouth is empty.  If someone can somehow get the essence of Sam's After Show in their mouth, instant winner. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  Because it's literally shit.  All right.  Oh, Sam.  By the way, weekdays at 10 a.m.  Catch the After Show.  Here we go.  I listen every day.  Go ahead, sir.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, nothing.  Wow.  Nothing.  Hey, fresh breath.  Get the fuck off the stage.  Oh, you and your stupid pussy.  Here we go. 
[01:30:00]  Fucking.  You Lavoris motherfucker.  Get out of here with you fresh breath and dressed fucking asshole.  All right.  Sam, we got a winner?  Colgate and shithead.  Well, you tell me.  Is the winner because.  Well, the guy that drank the puke was just extra.  That was great.  That was just sexy.  That was just sexy.  The guy who puked had the worst breath, E-Rock.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's up to E-Rock, really.  Yeah, the guy sporting the live from the compound shirt.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the winner.  I know that guy likes stuff that stinks.  Hey, hold on.  Do you think we should have an encore? 
[01:30:30]  Encore.  I mean, the guy's long and all.  Get him a cup.  Get him a cup.  Opie is like a dairy farmer.  He will milk the shit out of anything.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  You're doing it for 30 years.  All right, this guy.  He's vomiting in a cup.  There's a lime in this one.  There's a lime in that one.  Oh, he just ate the fucking lime.  All right, here's your encore.  Here's the guy that won the bad breath contest. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  All right.  You can't get it?  Look at E-Rock's face.  Yeah, your body looks like it sucks up everything you put in it.  It's probably hard to puke, right?  E-Rock, face the crowd.  This is a photo op for everyone on Twitter.  Photo op.  It's like when you're driving around the Grand Canyon.  You've got to pull off and take a shot.  Break out your cameras.  Here's your photo op.  I'm out of good.  You're all dry.  The lofting taste of bile. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Look, I've had it with you puking people.  Jesus Christ.  All right, we're at 115 Burberry Street, Marionette Park.  We'll be here for at least another hour.  Yeah, don't go anywhere.  A quick break and another surprise for everybody.  Stay there.  You're listening to the O.P. Anthony Show.  Live from Chicago.  Live from Chicago.  Live from Chicago.  Live from Chicago.  More.  Yes. 
[01:32:00]  Live from Chicago.  This is the O.P. Anthony Show.  All right, Chicago.  Where is Jimmy?  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy's hanging out.  Jimmy is hanging, having a good time in Chicago.  There he is.  Hi, Jimmy.  All right.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[01:32:30]  Fuck, we're having a blast.  We got a friend that stopped by and wants to say hi and join the festivities.  Yeah, it is CM Punk.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it is CM Punk.  Chicago's own CM Punk.  Fuck, yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck, yeah.  There he is.  Man, you are a Chicago guy.  I'm surprised that in this large crowd of drinkers, anybody knows who I am. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, right.  I know this much.  Sam has a boner right now.  I know, and I'm standing up.  You have a boner, right?  I'm standing up.  You have a boner.  Sam, stay on that end of the table.  Stay away from me.  Are you afraid of Sam like all the rest of the wrestlers are?  Because he's very aggressive with being your friend.  No, he's harmless.  Exactly.  Well, obviously.  I'm not afraid of him.  He's just so strange looking.  He really is.  Take that, Sam.  Is he a little creepy?  He's a little creepy.  Is this a yarmulke?  Yeah, somebody threw that up.  This is awesome.  We should just drink beer out of that. 
[01:33:30]  Is that...  Could that be a problem?  I don't even know.  I think it'd actually be easier to eat, like, peanuts out of.  Beer's probably more sacrilegious, though.  Yeah, does anybody have food we can eat out of this yarmulke?  Who threw the yarmulke up, by the way?  Where are you, sir?  I'm here.  That's all it takes to give up your religion?  An O&A show?  Yeah.  I don't blame you, sir.  Now, what made you do that?  I wanted people not to hate me, so I threw out my beer's cap.  Then I wanted people to hate me, so I threw out my yarmulke.  Wow.  Let my people see tits. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  Well, thank you very much, sir.  CM, do you want to...  Oh, you don't drink.  That's right.  You don't drink at all.  Good.  Nope.  What happened there?  Was it an early thing that you were drinking?  You fucked up?  No, I just...  Jimmy was something I never got into.  You never got into?  No.  I watched a lot of stupid stuff go down by the time I was 15.  Hey, look, I never knew you.  Don't fucking say that.  You want to see stupid stuff going down?  There was a lot of it already today.  We had a guy...  I'm waiting for more.  Yeah, that man vomited into a cup, and then that man drank it. 
[01:34:30]  What a lovely audience.  You like this audience, CM?  Absolutely.  All right, good.  They look familiar, don't they?  These are the same audience.  These are my people.  These are Chicago.  Now, by the way, the guy in the wheelchair, obviously you had an injury, but we didn't talk  to you yet.  What happened to you?  Uh-oh.  I wiped out on my motorcycle.  I wiped out on your motorcycle.  So, you're going to be okay?  Hey!  Hey!  I was jumping over the fucking hamburgers.  That's not good.  Chicken, very good.  It's the Black Fonz.  So, are you going to be okay? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  No, two more months.  Two more months.  What actually happened to you?  The bone on this side came out of the skin.  Nice.  This side fractured.  Oh, compound fracture?  Yeah, compound fracture.  And what happened?  You were riding your bike and someone hit you?  No, the guy in front of me jammed on his brakes.  So, I jammed on mine and ate it.  And then you skidded it out.  Following too closely, sir.  Yes.  No more bike for you?  There was a girl in a red dress across the street, that's why.  Oh!  I guess we all were looking over there and that's what they did.  Looking at a chicken. 
[01:35:30]  Are you going to get back on your bike?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Once I get it fixed.  Alright, that's smart.  That would deter me.  I flipped a moped when I was 15 years old.  And I've never gotten anything with two wheels again.  You put the mo in moped.  Wait a minute.  Wait, hold on a second.  That's a gay reference.  I don't care for that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, I did.  I flipped it over and I said I will never ride a motorcycle.  You weren't riding a motorcycle.  Yes, I was.  It's a fucking moped.  At 15, that was a motorcycle.  Oh, God.  With pedals.  A motorcycle does not have pedals. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, Anthony, this guy's trying to give you another shot.  He might have had enough, sir.  Look at him.  He's like, oh, hey.  He just said, hey.  He might have had enough.  He said, fuck you up.  He might have had enough.  I don't want to interrupt the show.  Is Opie cutting me off?  No, no, no.  Of course not.  Are you kidding me, man?  Hey, hey.  Oh, hey.  Hey, look.  Hey.  Hey, look.  Mommy.  I think I can fucking have a shot.  Alright?  Alright, a drink for Anthony of God knows what that fucking psychopath put in it.  You're a Brit. 
[01:36:30]  Would you take a beverage from a fan, CM?  Me?  No.  Hell no.  No, I wouldn't either.  It's liquid obnoxious.  I'm good.  I have a water.  Alright, cheers, my friend.  Cheers.  I'm not going to clink the glass with you.  What are we fucking...  Cheers.  Something?  Ran out of steam there, didn't I?  I was going to say, I mean, if you thought that something was slipping.  So you said you were going to say, but now you're saying it.  Yeah, that's true.  You're saying it.  You said I was going to say, and then you're still saying it.  He looks like an individual who would know what Halcyon is.  So I would be very cautious in drinking anything he hands you.  Hey, are you doing a signing or something? 
[01:37:00]  Are you plugging something at Comic-Con?  Yeah, I'll be at Comic-Con all day tomorrow.  It's called Wizard World, I think.  I think Comic-Con's a separate thing.  Wizard World.  Yes.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  So if you want to go see CM Punk and get a photo or whatever, he will be there.  Are you doing photos?  I'll be there all day doing photos, whatever.  That'd be funny.  If you pay me enough, I'll probably do anything.  I'm like Jim.  Yeah.  Except I usually pay for it.  I've never been paid for anything sexual.  That's a shame.  I know.  I would love it.  I like the fucking, like, the mutton choppy. 
[01:37:30]  You look like if Lemmy went back in a time machine.  I look like a young Lemmy?  Yeah, you look like some young Lemmy.  So is that my future?  That's what I have to look forward to?  Unfortunately.  Am I going to degenerate that bad?  Well, hell, if I live as long as him.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, you're calling Lemmy old?  He's in his fucking late 60s.  Let's be honest.  Come on.  Am I calling Lemmy old?  Am I being disrespectful if I say that?  No, you're right.  I did drink with Lemmy once, and you can't.  No.  You cannot drink with that guy.  I watched him, I was at the Golden God Awards or something like that.  I watched him drink an entire, like a novelty-sized thing of Jack Daniels. 
[01:38:00]  He loves Jack Daniels.  Yeah, no, it was ridiculous.  It was like, it was the joke bottle, and he drank the whole thing.  He wanted me to drink with him, so I mixed it with Coke like a faggot.  And apparently, that's what he called me.  He just drinks it straight.  You'll never drink it with him.  And if you mix Jack with him, you're a piece of shit.  Yeah, he's pickled on the inside.  Yeah, that's why he's still alive.  Lemmy did Down and Dirty with Jim Norton.  He was kind of like the musical guy.  He was in every show. 
[01:38:30]  And in Lemmy's Rider, though, like everybody has a rider.  In Lemmy's Rider, literally all he wants in his dressing room is Jack Daniels and sour cream and onion potato chips.  He is a fucking animal.  His heart must be worse than yours.  He should have been in the bad breath contest.  Hey, do you want to do oddest thing?  Yes, we have the oddest thing.  With CM Punk.  Yes, CM is here for us.  All right, obviously, we're trying to beat Philly.  And this goes back, what?  Good luck.  Like 10 years ago, 10, 11 years ago, when a guy brought in a freeze-dried monkey in a bag. 
[01:39:00]  CM Punk.  And then, because it's our show, another guy took his heart on it and put it in the mouth.  He got a blowjob from a freeze-dried monkey.  Oh, they brought out a table.  This is, like, fancy.  I was going to say, is that the strange thing somebody owns?  A table with a blue table on it.  Actually, this is for our gynecological exams, ladies.  Speculum?  Ah, the girls are laughing. 
[01:39:30]  I lick them like egg beaters.  Ooh, Doc, can I have one?  Sam, it's to you.  Oddest thing you own.  Hopefully, people brought some good stuff.  Danny, who's our first guy?  Oh, Danny's got the list.  Yeah, make sure the mic's going on.  Your mic's on, I heard it.  Can everybody know?  There it is.  No, but is it going out to the audience?  No.  No?  Oh, boo.  How about now?  Hello?  That's loud.  That's loud, though.  We got Danny here.  Yeah.  Anybody, anybody? 
[01:40:00]  Hey, can the sound guy...  There we go.  Oh, there we go.  Okay, cool.  Thank you very much.  Oh, you're the radio guy?  Okay, cool.  Everybody...  You look like the guy who was on trial in fucking Devil's Advocate.  For abusing the young girl.  Rubbing the bottom of the table lustily.  I say that with affection.  All right.  All right, go ahead, Danny.  Well, we do have a lot of contestants.  Okay, good.  Oh, good.  I don't know if we're going to have a lot of finalists. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, so you're saying a lot of people brought shit.  Oh, you want to...  Yeah.  And by the way, what is first prize?  A thousand dollars.  A thousand dollars.  On myhatestephensinger.com?  We got some cash.  Yes.  Wow.  So I guess I'll leave it up to you guys.  And so I'll divvy this list up into like okay stuff and then like the shit of the shit.  So...  Nothing's good?  Well, some stuff is like, what?  We were trying to beat a freeze-dried monkey.  Yeah, and I mean, it's not like they didn't know what to bring.  I mean, I think that the contest rules were defined well. 
[01:41:00]  And between the audio that was played on the air, I think everybody knew what they were contending with.  Is there anything Rick would offer more than 25 bucks for on Pawn Stars?  Oh, on Pawn Stars?  I got to frame it.  It's going to be in the shop for a long time.  Depending on the rarity and condition of someone.  It's George Washington's wooden teeth.  You know, they're wood.  If they were enamel, I'd give you a million.  But they're wood.  All right, Rick.  I know you're fucking me.  Do you want to...  Let's just give...  I'll give you an example of one and then we'll give an example of another. 
[01:41:30]  Well, should we bring the guy up and let him say what it is?  Yeah.  Let's bring the guy up and he says what it is.  All right.  How about this?  Let's first bring up Logan.  If Logan is here...  Oh, good.  I hope he doesn't run.  Logan!  Why don't you do the Chippa voice?  Please come to the stage.  Here's Logan.  Oh, here he is.  Don't blow the surprise for everybody right off the bat.  Logan, where are you from, brother?  Northern.  How about you talking to him, Mike?  Oh, sorry.  I'm from normal Illinois.  Ah, well...  Not even good. 
[01:42:00]  Okay, and you brought something for us?  Yes, I brought Pat Boone in a metal mood.  Fucking racist.  That's the weirdest thing you own?  That's the weirdest thing you own?  Sorry, what?  That's the weirdest thing you own?  Well, it was the weirdest thing I owned.  You dug around your house.  And that's all you found?  Well, I didn't know if anybody was bringing anything.  So $1,000?  It's $1,000.  Well, he was the guy that thought, I'll just bring something and hope I'm the only contestant. 
[01:42:30]  Right, right, right.  Pretty much.  All right.  In a way, that's smart.  I think there's way more skeletons in your closet than a Pat Boone CD.  Well, if Pat Boone was here, I would suck his cock, if that was a strange thing.  Oh, that would probably win, yeah.  All right, well...  All right, loser.  Get off the stage.  Get off the stage.  Get off the stage.  All right.  Boom!  Boom!  So far, Pat Boone CD only can...  So you have to beat a Pat Boone CD.  That's going to be tough, I think.  Danny, what do we got next?  Well, next up, let me get... 
[01:43:00]  So that's like the kind of, you know...  That's one of the ones that's not the greatest thing.  So we'll put it on that list.  Oh, shit.  Now we'll put some stuff on the more interesting list.  Wow.  All right.  Let's get a good one.  Yeah, but we're not going to start out with the best.  But let's get Joe up here.  Joe.  Oh, jeez.  My handwriting stinks.  Joe?  But you're the only Joe.  All right, Joe.  Joe's working his way up.  Another guy with the...  What I like to call the comb-over of the new millennium.  Boy, the second someone starts losing that hair, they just shave that shit right off, don't they? 
[01:43:30]  Steve Wilkos.  Oh.  Yeah, that's Steve.  All right, Joe.  Where are you from?  I'm from Oak Lawn, Illinois.  Hey, when you open the kitchen drawer, do all the forks just stick to your hand?  You got it.  Sometimes a spoon...  All right.  Joe, what do you got, buddy?  No?  Matrix?  Genuine kangaroo scrotum.  Wait, wait, wait.  What makes it genuine?  It's just...  Exactly. 
[01:44:00]  It's just...  In the original wrapper.  It looks like it's just a balloon, though.  Now, that looks like a whoopee cushion, but it is leathery.  With a keychain.  It's a keychain.  And, uh...  All right, you know what?  We got a contest.  That's weird.  That's odd.  Is that a real...  Wow.  Father of a murdered son.  Husband of a murdered wife.  See Roman war helmet?  No?  Fuck you all.  Fuck you all.  It was very...  Are you not entertained? 
[01:44:30]  Wow, that looks very red.  Well, those kangaroos must get their balls scrunched along.  It's pretty fucked up.  Look at the band-aids on his balls.  It's pretty fucked up there.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty fucked up.  All right.  You know what?  And it's a novelty item.  It was for sale.  You didn't rip it off yourself off a kangaroo.  I wish I did.  You punch him in his face and tear his ball back off.  Kill the fucking dingo.  It's in your mouth.  How about this?  It beats the Pat Boone CD.  Yeah.  Very good.  You are right.  So you saved us.  You're in first place.  All right.  I think you're in first place. 
[01:45:00]  Who would have known that piece of shit trinket is a home run in this audience?  So now, seeing as we have a separation between the two lists, what list would we like to continue with?  Do you want to go back to the Pat Boone shit or do you want to move on from the kangaroo scrotum?  We should alternate.  Yeah.  I think alternate.  Yeah, yeah.  You just say a name and we'll go.  I brought my shoes and my glasses so I'll have them.  This is how spontaneous me coming out here is.  I didn't know we were having a contest.  I would have brought something.  What do you have that might be odd? 
[01:45:30]  Well, when I was in the back and I heard we were doing a contest, the first thing that  came to mind, and I don't know, I might be able to find something more strange in my  house, but I own a human skull.  A real human skull?  Yes.  And where did that come from?  I can't tell you.  Oh, shit.  Illegal.  Oh, shit.  Illegal.  Adam Walsh!  Oh, shit.  Oh, what the?  Wow.  I was just quoting Sam.  Why?  I was just quoting Sam.  Why?  I was just quoting Sam.  Why would you bring it up?  What happened?  Well, we had to fill CM. 
[01:46:00]  It would happen.  We were interviewing John Walsh.  Why would you bring it up?  I was interviewing John Walsh.  It's not even in context to what we were talking about.  Why would you?  Listen to me, Sam.  I'm going to tell you at SummerSlam.  Sam, we were interviewing John Walsh, Sam and I, and when he walked in, Sam didn't mean  to me, but he went, Adam Walsh!  He yelled Adam Walsh to John Walsh.  And John goes, my name is John, and I'm like, hi, John, welcome, John.  Oh, Jimmy was fucking flustered.  Hi, John.  Welcome, John.  We love you, John, not Adam.  Yeah, do you have to use the John? 
[01:46:30]  I've been a John.  Anything to come, and he didn't do it on purpose.  He just did it because he's an incompetent.  And Sam is getting little titties, by the way.  I hope everybody notices.  Sam is getting little titties.  That happens after marriage.  It happens after marriage.  It's like, oh, my wife, she made a wonderful meal today.  It was like, oh, my God.  Sam, can you take a bump today from CM Punk?  I guess.  Oh, shit.  Yeah?  Are you wanting to say hormone replacement therapy?  And by bump, we mean a snort a Coke. 
[01:47:00]  No?  No.  Any Coke heads?  Hey.  Shit, that's not.  Who's next?  I don't know how to party.  Danny, what do you got next?  Well, how about Uriah?  Let's have Uriah come up here.  Uriah and Heap.  Where are you?  Oh.  Remember them?  Can we get Uriah?  Here's Uriah.  How about you know them?  Jimmy said he's laughing.  No, you're spelling that one.  I hope it's not just the backpack.  Uriah, where are you from?  It's a bomb!  St. Charles, Illinois. 
[01:47:30]  St. Charles, Illinois.  It sure was.  It sure is.  I don't know how to speak Wookiee book.  Oh, shit.  Can I see it?  Oh.  Let me see.  You know, if you would have told us that in Klingon.  Sam, can I see that?  Wait, oh.  Wait, how old is he?  How old?  That's good.  How to speak Sheckler.  Jimmy's room is next to mine. 
[01:48:00]  I heard that last night.  See, because he was.  How old is this?  Well, that's not going to beat the...  It's a new book, right?  No, that does not quite...  Beat the kangaroo scrotum?  It's still kangaroo scrotum.  So far, the Wookiee book is not good.  The kangaroo scrotum is in first.  This is an easy contest to win.  If you've got something weird, you can drive down if you live close.  No more bullshit.  So wait, everybody's a fan of the show, and you listened to the episode that was in Philly,  and you knew somebody showed up with, what, a frozen... 
[01:48:30]  A freeze-dried monkey.  A freeze-dried monkey.  And you bring a Pat Moon CD and a Wookiee book.  Thank you.  What are you guys doing?  Chicago, fucking represent.  You know what?  You're right.  Somebody go find a monkey right now.  Go ahead.  All right, Danny said...  I just had my belt.  All right, let's get to something better than that.  Yeah, Danny said enough with the bullshit.  Let's go, Danny.  Yeah, really.  All right, let's get Jeff K.  Jeff K.  All right.  How about...  Jeff K.  I know, it's hard to think of lettuce, isn't it? 
[01:49:00]  Here's Jeff.  Lettuce or carrots?  How you doing?  Hi, Jeff K.  Where are you from?  Chicago.  Hi, Jeff K.  How you doing?  Wow.  What do you got, Jeff?  He's wearing the Nike Swish, so with just do it, you mean eating.  So?  Big guy.  I'm in the, I look like, Iraq competition later.  Uh-huh.  Oh, Iraq, because he's bad.  Wait, give me Iraq a shot for once.  Iraq, you all right with that?  I couldn't even hear what he said.  Oh, because there's fat in your ears.  Yeah.  Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  He's calling it fat. 
[01:49:30]  That's not cool.  Jeff, what do you do for a living?  I'm a headhunter.  You're a headhunter, which means you get people.  Well, so am I, but that's more for, you know.  Ah.  I'm a man of leisure.  I miss stupid Steve.  All right, so you're a headhunter, which means you get people jobs.  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  And he brought something.  What do we got, Sam?  Sam, how about you show us first?  Yeah, he asked himself.  There you go.  Oh, well.  It's framed, so it's not going to stay in my shop for long. 
[01:50:00]  What the fuck is this?  I'll give you $10 for it.  No.  I wanted $2,000.  He gave me $10.  I feel pretty good.  I'm going to get a gumball.  Now, it says chemical prophylactic kit.  Oh!  And there's a bunch of, which is a very old piece of paper with some, like, it looked  like stains on it.  What exactly is this that we're looking at?  It's a prophylactic kit from World War II.  World War II.  Wow.  So this is so the guys could.  Now, how did this work, sir?  Please.  You've got to read the instructions.  Can I see it?  Yeah.  Let's read the instructions.  I'll be very careful with it. 
[01:50:30]  It's a lot of shit in a frame, to be honest with you.  This is my granddaddy.  Let me show you a prophylactic kit from World War II.  Hold on.  That's not bad.  But, let's see.  It says.  Who cares if you're fucking without a prophylactic?  You're going home.  End the dough, boys.  It says, immediate treatment kit for prevention only, not a cure.  Oh.  Directions used immediately after contact, which I guess means after you finish your load.  A, pass your water. 
[01:51:00]  Water.  B, wet a small soaked cloth, which is one of these items, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  And make a lather by squeezing in the hand.  Boy, they're really giving out the fucking...  How stupid were people in 1943?  They don't know how to make a lather.  No, anything.  And wash all your private parts thoroughly for several minutes.  I love that movie.  Rinse your cloth and squeeze it out.  Then wipe your private parts dry.  CM, you want to do letter C? 
[01:51:30]  I'm picturing all this happening in a foxhole, by the way.  Yeah.  Squeeze into your urine canal the entire contents of the metal tube.  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, shit.  Ow!  Massage jelly well back into the canal and retain for at least five minutes.  Oh, my God.  And there is a little thing in there.  Watch an episode of Amos and Andy while you do it.  There is a little tube with a little cap on it, which was probably squeezed into some poor fucker from Long Island's dick back in 1943. 
[01:52:00]  Get your wife to suck it out before you punch her in the eye.  Massage the contents of the white tube for at least three minutes over the entire length of the penis and adjacent abdomen and thighs,  paying particular attention to the foreskin, the head, and the neck of the penis.  The neck of the penis.  This sounds disastrous.  Yeah.  I'm just squeezing my dick.  Exactly.  I don't know why.  The instructions should say, get Hooker, squirt this into her mouth.  And then the final E, it says, wrap the tissue sheet around your penis and cover with cloth bag to protect your clothing. 
[01:52:30]  Avoid passing your water for at least four hours.  And you can see the thing that got wrapped around the head and sheath of the penis.  It looks like one of those old tabac-y pouches.  Yeah, it's a very small Ku Klux Klan hood.  Your racist penis.  Go ahead, Danny.  Show that.  That's pretty fucking full.  That is, so far, is a very fucking cool item. 
[01:53:00]  What the fuck?  You're looking at a pawn in a cell.  Wowee.  That's pretty good.  That's passing around to the...  I bet your pawn stars would buy that.  I wonder what that felt like.  What was in the tube that squirted into your cock fucking vein?  No clue.  That's got to be painful.  It says it in there.  I just skipped that part.  That looks fucking painful.  What do you guys think of that?  That's pretty good.  Not bad.  I like that one.  That's not bad.  I think he's in the lead.  Prophylactic kit.  Yeah, that's fun.  All right, thank you.  I'm going to have an expert come in and see if it's a genuine prophylactic kit.  I know a guy. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  All right, let's have Hector come up.  Hector.  Hector.  He'll be next with his oddest thing.  All right, a green card.  Oh, because his name's Hector.  Get it?  Ah, you're fucking illegal.  Oh, no.  You look pretty American.  What's up, Hector?  Yeah.  He just got in the bag.  Bubble wrap.  That's crazy.  It's fun to squeeze.  Oh, it's so good.  That means he's protecting that.  Oh.  We got a skull.  What is it? 
[01:54:00]  Dog.  A dog skull?  Oh, God.  Oh, that's impressive.  That's kind of cool, though.  That's good.  Was it your pet?  No.  How did you find it?  Yeah.  My buddy gave it to me.  It was from New Mexico, the desert.  Oh, God.  What?  Liar.  Why are you calling him a liar?  Why is he a liar, sir?  I've been informed we have a late entry, and it makes perfect sense to bring him up right  now.  Oh, shit. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Hold back for a second on your dog skull.  Let's get the late entry in.  It's in a cooler.  It's in a cooler.  Oh, good.  Raleigh Fingers has something for us.  All right.  This guy's a problem.  He's got a cooler.  He's opening it up on stage.  What's his name?  Sam, do you miss your dad looking at his mustache?  I have my dog skull, and it's complete.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  I had this dog.  My parents had this dog from before I was born.  Yeah.  It died under the shed.  You killed it, obviously.  Yep.  Oh, my God.  I removed the skull myself. 
[01:55:00]  What?  It died.  That's a big lunatic.  What kind of dog was it?  What kind of dog?  It was a Rottweiler mix.  That's a big fucking solid skull.  I see your skull and raise you a jawbone.  I want to ask Jeffrey Dahmer, why did you remove the skull yourself?  I'm a creepy fuck.  I don't know.  Just to remember him by.  Now, let me tell you something.  Did you had to cut his head off?  No.  How did you remove the flesh and skin from his head?  Since it was under the shed, it was missing for like two weeks. 
[01:55:30]  And when I found him, it was already decomposing.  You just thought it was Jimmy's ass that he was smelling?  So I just used some kitchen knives and tried it out myself.  Like I did that hooker back in 1998.  The dog died and had a pair of his mom's pants and peanut butter on his mouth.  Just kidding, sir.  No, you're not.  What was the name of the dog?  Rally.  Oh, really?  Living the life of Rally.  It means you're under a shed.  Poor little guy. 
[01:56:00]  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Fuck it!  Oh, man.  They want him to fuck.  Oh, my God.  Wait, he's got it.  The medulla hole?  The medulla hole?  Sir, you can't do that.  You can't fuck your...  That's okay, right?  No, you can't pull out your penis in the place.  We can tell him all you want.  You can...  I'll just shove it in your pants.  He's fucking...  It's pretty small.  ...the back of his dog's skull.  It's a grower, not a shower. 
[01:56:30]  But you're putting your...  Like the dog.  He's putting his dick in his old dog's...  Wow.  ...skull?  That's fucking brutal.  Don't fuck your dog head, sir.  I can't take that.  I haven't seen one breast all day.  I want to see breasts before somebody fucks a...  Except for that fat guy.  Thank you, sir.  If you're going to fuck your dog's skull,  I want to hear a Sarah McLachlan song while you do it.  So I can contribute money.  All right, that's pretty good, though.  That beats the other skull guy, so you can beat it.  Wow, yeah.  Both good entries, but that...  You can beat it.  Hit the bricks walking. 
[01:57:00]  That's right.  But this guy that has the skull in his actual family dog,  that's pretty cool.  It's fucked up, but it's...  Is there a second place?  Prize, or are we just going first place?  I kind of...  I don't think we even have a first or second yet.  I think it's between a prophylactic guy and guy that's such a dick.  But he's saying, is there a better prize?  Well, hold on.  Let's ask the crowd.  What's better?  This guy's a family pet?  Dead skull?  The world wants your prophylactic?  I love prophylactic. 
[01:57:30]  Sorry, bro.  Wow.  But that was good.  Real good.  You know what, though?  I will say that's a good choice because the dog skull is really cool,  but the prophylactic thing is rarer.  Like, you know what I mean?  Although, if you put your dog skull on your dick,  you probably won't get a disease.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Thank you.  Good night.  By the way, Spaz is in the audience for the old-timers.  Where's that?  Giant mosquito.  New York hat there.  Oh, kind of.  Yeah.  There you go.  You look like a guy that used to work with us. 
[01:58:00]  Whatever.  All right.  What do we got next, Danny?  Well, next, let's try Jackie W.  She's got something kind of morbid.  Jackie?  Yeah, Jackie.  It's Jackie!  Just hop on up here.  It's my hysterectomy in a bucket.  Wasn't the last thing morbid, though?  Oh, shit.  This might be a little morbid.  Okay.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hi.  How are you?  Hello, sweetheart.  Pretty good.  Were you a gymnast?  Sorry.  No.  You're very good.  You're a nice, you're very sexy, sexy. 
[01:58:30]  So are you.  So are you.  You think so?  Thank you.  What is that?  FH Riley's.  What do you got there?  Huntington.  Joyce DeWitt?  Yeah.  That's funny.  No.  Of course it is.  9-11.  My husband was working down on the pit.  Oh, this will be funny.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Everyone just say a shame.  It's really funny.  Is this going to make us very sad, miss?  Oh, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's a dead woman's shoe that got blown up.  What?  No, no, no. 
[01:59:00]  No.  Why would you keep that?  I don't think I own.  It is odd.  You can't burn.  I'm not touching that.  You can't pull her.  That's...  Look, we said oddest thing.  That's pretty odd.  That is...  It's real.  Hey, that's a relic from a national character.  No, it's an artifact.  You can feel where her toes were.  Let me see.  Let me see.  You can feel where her toes were.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  I'm not shitting you.  I'm getting a report that we have Mohammed Atta's jockstrap, which trumps that one. 
[01:59:30]  Dude, that's fucked up.  You've got to look at it.  I'm not going to touch it.  I don't want to touch it.  It's half a shoe from...  And it's got like World Trade Center goop in it.  You could...  You could...  Oh, man.  There's a big cut on top.  I bet she got hurt on her foot.  You...  I remember that smell, unfortunately.  I'm going to donate it to the museum.  Oh, really?  That's nice of you.  That's great.  Museum of tasteless, tacky people?  No, the World Trade Center Museum down there.  Oh, that's a very good idea. 
[02:00:00]  It's probably a good...  Oh, that's very nice of you.  Hey, look.  It is a weird artifact.  It really is.  It really is, Jimmy.  I think the World War II...  Because I have something from the Trade Center to my house.  I think that...  Wait, wait.  Let me ask you, though.  Why did you...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Why did you decide to keep that?  And how did you get it?  Yeah, how did you get it?  How did you get it?  That's the thing.  My husband was...  A woman hopping around going,  Ow, ow, ow.  It's illegal.  I shouldn't have that.  Why not?  Because there's cocaine in it.  He was working down the pit and the cameras, 
[02:00:30]  and we weren't supposed to take anything.  And I found it poking up through the dirt and the rubble.  You think you were saving someone at first?  Hey, I found a...  Not so much, no.  Oh, wow.  No, but I knew it was an artifact.  I'm a history teacher.  I knew it was an artifact.  Artifact has to be a little older, I think.  Yeah.  I think in like a hundred years,  if they dig around and find a shoe,  they'll be like,  Ah, we found a shoe.  I probably wouldn't have kept that, but...  Hell of a role model.  If you could still smell the foot fungus,  it's not an artifact.  But you really...  Graved digger!  You're a grave digger! 
[02:01:00]  Graved digger!  You can't buy that.  No, of course you can.  You can't buy that.  I love the rationale.  You can't buy that.  You can't.  Yeah.  She makes a point.  You can't buy that.  You can't make this shit up.  You're not going to find that itself.  All right.  Well, thank you for bringing it.  But I still say that the World War II prophylactic is in the lead.  Whoa, whoa.  Let's see.  All right.  No, no.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Uh-uh.  No way.  Yeah, she wants a shot, Elise.  What are you guys thinking?  You can buy those prophylactics on eBay. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, she's yelling.  She's yelling at the crowd.  Where's a Muslim terrorist when you need one?  You can buy those prophylactics on eBay.  You cannot buy this.  And I am not lying.  It might be something on Craigslist.  It also proves karma is bullshit.  You want to show your tits?  You know what?  I do think she has, even though emotionally people don't like it because it's from a very  sad thing, she has the weirdest thing.  I think so, too. 
[02:02:00]  She absolutely does.  We said odd thing.  We didn't say odd thing because it makes anyone uncomfortable.  It is a one-of-a-kind.  That is, if she's telling the truth, that's the...  Hold on.  Let's ask CM Punk.  CM Punk, the only sober person in the joint.  What do you think?  I agree.  I agree.  I think that's stranger than a World War II prophylactic kit.  She convinced me when she said you could buy that on eBay.  And the fact that she took it herself is pretty amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ugh. 
[02:02:30]  Rape robber.  All right.  What's any luck we have?  Well, let's get Justin F. up here and take a look at what he has for us.  All right.  Let's see what Justin has.  Honest thing you own here live in Chicago.  Where's Justin?  Justin F.  Please make your way to the stage.  Working his way up to the stage.  Please welcome your next dancer, Justin F.  He's coming from the right.  We didn't see that.  All right.  Oh, he's got a backpack.  Oh, it's a fucking bomb. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, I don't like these backpacks.  Oh, God.  This is horrifying.  I love these backpacks.  What's with those shorts?  Yeah.  Why don't you come up with them all?  Yeah.  He's going to Bushwood after this.  He's opening his backpacks.  What's your name, sir?  What's your name?  My name's Justin.  Oh, Justin F.  Okay, sorry.  I've got two pieces of the Berlin Wall, one from the eastern side and one from the western  side.  Hold on.  They don't like that.  Hold on now. 
[02:03:30]  I'm sorry?  Why don't people like?  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  What's wrong with the Berlin Wall?  Well, I think because I've seen this on Pawn Stars before.  And when they brought in the Berlin Wall, they said that if you have a big slab with artwork  on it, it's a collector's item.  But there's so many chunks available from a huge wall that, oh, oh, sir, sir, you've  got to allow me to return.  This piece right here is from the western side.  It does have graffiti on it.  And this piece right here, this piece right here is from the eastern side. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, let him fight east side, west side, bitchy.  He has official documentation as well.  Can I see it?  Can I see that?  Which one?  This wall piece.  Can I, can I?  He's of a fucking cinder block.  Nice.  Can I say something, though?  When I was working in Buffalo doing radio, we gave these out as prizes.  Did you?  Yeah, pieces of the Berlin Wall.  Pretty interesting.  It was very easy to get back in the day.  It was a wall that stretched pretty fucking far.  Hey, you want to impress me, bring the whole fucking wall.  There you go. 
[02:04:30]  There you go.  That's a guy who's hard to impress.  Oh, what do you have?  I also have my father's business partner over in Germany.  Your father.  Oh, Greg makes shit videos.  He was on the western side, and he went to the eastern side, got himself a wife.  His wife's father was a KGB agent.  Ah, KGB agent.  All right?  And got my father a, uh...  He got him original magnetic trays and genuine linen napkins.  What is that, Sam?  I don't know.  Who is it?  Check out a book. 
[02:05:00]  No one can.  Oh, it's a medal.  Is that a passport?  Yeah.  That's a passport.  It looks like David Hasselhoff's passport.  Yeah, you're a paper.  That's my dad.  That's your dad?  That's my dad, yeah.  Oh, is your dad's passport?  Is that an anti-Semitism medal?  No, it's KGB.  They weren't exactly anti-Semitism.  Can I see that, or...  Now, that is that, and that's a communist medal as well.  Can I keep this?  Can I see that?  No.  My dad wants it back.  Was it given to Obama?  I would never give a single thing to Obama. 
[02:05:30]  Shut up, you liberals.  I don't like it.  Wow, dude.  Wow, okay.  Can I see that?  Who's the guy?  It's pretty cool.  Can I see that, or...  Oh, no.  I don't like him.  Oh, no.  No, I don't.  Oh, shit.  Oh, I didn't even think of that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  Oh, my God.  No, I'm not watching.  I can't watch.  Don't do it.  Please don't.  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  That's my dad's fucking thing. 
[02:06:00]  You're going to do it, do it.  Oh, no, don't.  No, it's his dad's thing.  No.  Come on, dad.  No.  Please.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Can I have it back, Ophi?  Oh, he wants it back.  He's asking for it back.  Don't do it.  Ophi, I'm going to ask you.  Oh, he's putting it down his dick.  Oh, he's grabbing his butt.  Oh, you.  I've been shut down?  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  I'm a goddamn father now.  Take your fucking thing back.  Let me grab it from you, Ophi, 
[02:06:30]  and I'll give it back to a faggot.  Oh, what the fuck?  Give me another shot.  It was the right thing to do.  You piece of shit.  It was the right thing.  Fucking angry ant sucks.  I know.  You could just say ant.  All right.  That was very good.  That was a good one.  I still say that the woman has the best  or the oddest thing.  It is the oddest thing.  I got to agree.  Again, you guys will ultimately vote,  but I'm...  Yeah.  What's that?  Hold on.  Captain Willard from Apocalypse Now. 
[02:07:00]  Come up out of the water and tell us.  You called the young lady a woman.  Yes.  What's the difference?  Holy shit.  What?  She shouldn't be called the victim.  Young lady.  Oh, I see.  Oh, there you go.  I file trade with that guy.  But what is she trying to say?  All the items have been very educational so far.  Yes.  Except for the dog skulls.  Yeah, the dog skulls.  But even that had a story.  All right.  Let's move on to the next one. 
[02:07:30]  So, school.  Somebody spiced this up.  Exactly.  There's basically one good thing left.  Oh, okay.  And then there's a whole bunch of shit stuff.  So, do you want to go back to shit stuff?  So, how about we do this?  More shit stuff.  I said we do a quick break.  Yeah, I got to piss.  I got to piss.  And then we'll finish the oddest thing you own, I think.  Is that fair?  That is very fair.  Are you staying?  Yeah.  CM Punk is staying.  Let's do it for CM Punk.  See him at Comic-Con tomorrow.  That's so fucking cool he stopped by today.  And are you guys having a good time today with us in Chicago?  Woo! 
[02:08:00]  Thank you for coming down, man.  You guys are a great crowd.  We have a little more while to go.  Stick around.  We'll be back in five minutes.  Yeah, fuck you.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is live from Chicago.  More O&A in moments.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Live from Chicago.  All right. 
[02:08:30]  Chicago, how you guys doing?  Good?  These fucking guys are hanging in there, huh?  Yep.  Jesus Christ.  That piss was awesome.  Yeah, it really was.  That was a good one.  Well, Jimmy, tickling your balls probably made it that much better.  You know?  That wasn't tickling.  The word is licking.  Tee-hee.  All right.  We're in the middle of the oddest thing you own here in Chicago.  Who doesn't?  Well.  Oh, the girls.  And CM Punk, obviously, really, thank you so much. 
[02:09:00]  We love CM Punk.  Absolutely.  These aren't working.  What do they do?  By the way, we're having a contest after a woman who has the thickest vagina.  Thick?  Largest wins $300 and some semen on her shoe.  All right.  Why is this fucking towel here?  Like Jake LaMotta?  Get rid of this fucking thing.  Where's Danny? 
[02:09:30]  I'm here.  All right.  Danny?  Oh, there he is.  Danny.  Now, Danny, so far, for anyone listening out there, let's refresh what we have so far.  You're among friends, Danny.  From the cool things that we've seen here, we have a kangaroo scrotum.  Yes.  That was good.  We have the prophylactic kit from World War II.  Yes.  We also have the 9-11 shoe.  Yeah.  We also have pieces of the Berlin Wall as well.  Now, also, we have a very interesting angle from a couple of our cop friends in the back 
[02:10:00]  about the 9-11 shoe.  Okay.  And these are guys that were there.  That were actually on the ground right after it happened.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're saying, not verifiable.  They're a little suspect.  Oh, she's doing bullshit.  They're a little suspect.  She's doing bullshit.  Oh, shit.  She picked it up herself.  No, no, no.  That's what she's saying.  Hold on.  We believe you.  I believe you took it out of the ground.  Yes.  But the thing is, it could have been blown out.  It might not have been on someone's foot at that moment.  It could have been a bum's shoe that they lost earlier. 
[02:10:30]  It could have been in a file cabinet.  Yeah, it could have just been in the garbage or something.  It could have been, but the location where it was, it was down in the level.  Oh, man.  Will you let Leatherface talk, please?  The level.  Go ahead, Smith.  These people are from Chicago.  They weren't there.  Wait a second.  Hey.  You know, they evacuated all the big buildings in Chicago, too, even though no one gave a  shit about crashing in Chicago.  And don't call it Chicago.  Sound like you're from here.  I call it Chi-Town. 
[02:11:00]  Going to the Willis Tower in Chi-Town.  We went down there.  We had to walk down there because there was no mass transportation.  So we had to walk down there from Penn Station.  And so it was Saturday.  What up, the Pencil Station?  It was Saturday.  Fucking all run, Colmia.  Take us out.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Jesus.  We're lying.  No, no, no.  I didn't do that.  What the fuck?  What happened to Lisa Orban?  Ah, yes. 
[02:11:30]  Four people got that.  It was that Saturday, and it was right underneath.  No one gives a fuck.  Hold on.  Let Nick Morris finish.  All right.  9-11.  The who gives a fuck story is on the history.  That's not flattering at all.  That's not a word.  Well, we were there, and I was playing Looks That Kill.  All right.  Go ahead.  What happened?  Ursa from Superman 2.  Go ahead, sweetheart.  You can feel her toes in it.  So, I mean, so it wasn't from a shoe store. 
[02:12:00]  It was fat.  You suck.  You suck.  No, she hung.  You suck.  You suck.  She is so fucking pissed off.  Hold on.  I am so fucking pissed off.  You're mad at us.  I love you.  Oh, thank you.  I love you.  You have a big vagina.  You mad at these people for disrespecting your ghost shoe, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're disrespecting that lady shit.  Yeah, you're disrespecting the lady.  Don't try to make it sound like you're paying homage to her.  Oh, shit.  She's yelling at someone.  Oh, shit.  Hold on, Sam.  Mike, what's happening? 
[02:12:30]  I got disinfected.  What's up, Bill?  Why are you so pissed?  He's nasty and he's nice.  Who's nasty?  Show us the nasty guy.  Yeah.  Which one?  The guy with the...  Oh, which one of our audience members is nasty?  We're going to have him removed.  Fucking empty room.  What can I tell you?  Mine is the only article that you cannot buy.  Artifact.  But what about his glasses?  You can't buy it on eBay.  I don't think you can buy it.  It's going to the museum. 
[02:13:00]  Is it?  Museum.  Does the museum want it?  It's the 9-11 museum.  It's the museum of who gives a shit?  Danny, let's go.  Let's move on to the contest.  Hold on a second, guys.  I don't know if this is the wrong time.  But I just wanted to say...  You got a boner?  That I feel really good.  I just wanted to ruin the flow of the show. 
[02:13:30]  Well done.  There's nothing better than just disappointing everybody at once.  It's like I just fucked you all.  By the way, I'm tweeting dead shoe if anyone gives a fuck.  Who's next?  You can make your own decision.  Danny, what's up?  Dan?  We're going here live in Chicago.  Let's go with...  If we're going to end with a good item, we want to go with the...  We're feeding back stuff.  Dan, please.  It's you.  It's you.  I won't be ignored, Dan. 
[02:14:00]  Let's have Keith M. come to the stage.  Let's hear...  Keith M.  Keith M.  Oh.  I traveled with Keith M.  Not that one.  The other one.  Oh.  Yes.  He's making his way to stay.  Again?  Same guy?  Very...  What are you doing?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Hey.  Hey, wait.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Nice.  Nice trip.  What are you...  Have a nice summer.  Have a nice winter.  That didn't work.  What happened?  Not you.  What happened, Danny?  I know. 
[02:14:30]  I must have both of you.  Did you really think we were going to see your dog skull again?  What did you think?  We were reconsidering?  I made a mistake.  Fucking beat it with your morbid lunch.  Wait.  Did he say a dog skull?  Get him back up here.  Oh.  That sounds fascinating.  Throw a stick and have him run off stage.  It's E-Rock.  Huh?  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  Come on up.  Oh.  Let's see.  Oh.  Oh.  That's not E-Rock.  Oh, no.  Oh, my.  Wow.  Wow.  You're a fat fuck.  Strangest thing you own. 
[02:15:00]  Your body.  Wow.  It's not a treadmill.  All right.  Oh, my God.  What's your name, sir?  What?  Microphone.  Ben.  Ben.  Okay, Ben.  Don't worry, Kenny.  I don't think he's going to thrust it into our chest.  No.  He might take it to Morton's and order with it.  That's a steak.  You think he can afford Morton's?  Come on, man.  It's a...  Dude, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got to like...  What's your name?  Ben.  Ben.  Okay, Ben.  As a kid, Ben Dover?  I manage a pawn shop. 
[02:15:30]  Do you really?  Oh, you do.  Now, Ben...  What is it?  A food pawn shop?  No.  Ah, see, because I say sold.  Sold.  Now, you're a big guy, Ben.  Now, that's obviously very inconvenient for you, right?  It's hard for you?  Do you try to...  Do you try to...  I have.  It's hard, right?  Yeah.  How much do you weigh, Ben?  How much do you weigh?  Be honest.  Three digits.  Three digits?  Is the first one a nine?  I'm kidding, Ben.  Why?  But aren't you worried about your health? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  I step on the scale.  I weigh error.  Why?  See, because the scale...  Ben there.  Can I ask you a question?  Do you think what you have beats the World War II Propholactic Kit?  Well, it's from the same time period.  Okay, but do you think...  Are you confident that it beats...  I feel like it could.  Because I want to know why, that if you think maybe yours is going to come up short, why  you would subject yourself to coming up on this stage and being under the scrutiny of  these inebriated gentlemen who are clearly going to pick you apart. 
[02:16:30]  I got a quick idea.  Just a quick idea.  Could Sam try on your shirt?  I'll give you a hundred bucks.  What the fuck?  Wow.  I'll give you a hundred dollars.  I don't want to lose him.  What?  We would lose him.  Oh.  Could Sam try on your shirt?  I'll give you a hundred dollars.  He'd be embarrassed.  You don't want to take your shirt off.  It would be one of those...  What's that?  I'm sure.  All right, Sam, take off your hoodie. 
[02:17:00]  Here's another photo op for everybody.  I hope he's at a hundred bucks.  Oh, shit.  He's got two.  Yeah, good boy.  Oh, he's got two shirts.  He's got two.  Fuck.  He fucking wins.  This kid wins.  I was hoping to see him without his shirt on.  He's got another shirt on.  Oh, what a fucking genius this kid is.  Fuck.  Here's a hundred.  Take your headphones off, stupid.  That's his swimsuit.  He's going swimming after this.  All right.  Sam is trying on a giant red shirt.  And Opie's pulling out the worst hundred bucks he ever spent. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, God.  This is the worst bet ever.  Is that XL, XXL, or Buick?  I think it's a car's big.  Holy shit.  All right, Sam, turn around to the crowd.  They all want to take your picture.  They all want to take your picture.  Chris, put on a Chris DeBerg song.  Lady and Renna something.  It looks like a cake.  Jimmy, give him the hundred.  It does.  Yes.  It's super douche.  Here you are, Ben.  A hundred bucks from fucking Gregorio.  And if you knew it, that should be the oddest thing you own.  A hundred bucks from Opie. 
[02:18:00]  That's good.  That'll buy you appetizers.  They don't laugh too long.  See, because...  Right?  All right.  And it's just a mean motherfucking bitch.  No, not, you cunt.  He's brutal today.  All right.  So what do you got there, Ben?  Besides a hundred dollars for me.  What do you got for us, Ben?  It's an authentic Nazi dress band.  Oh, Jesus.  If you did not see it, then how are you supposed to look at it?  Let me see this thing. 
[02:18:30]  I feel like you're German.  Yeah, what is it?  Invincible?  All right.  That's a...  Let me take a look.  After you're done, sir.  If it's authentic, wouldn't there be a Swazi on it somewhere?  What do you think?  Yeah.  It's authentic.  I've done a lot of research.  Oh, have you?  What research have you done?  Let me take a look.  I am an expert in not only the materials, but the ideology.  It's actually one that would have been carried by a fireman.  A fireman in Nazi Germany?  A Nazi fireman. 
[02:19:00]  That's good.  Let it burn.  Yeah, really.  What do they do?  Let's take a look, C.  You know what?  Let me see.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm pretty sure they have a Swazi on it.  Even from a...  Just Google it, Punk.  Google it.  Google it.  I'm going to Google this knife right now.  Punk, can I take a look, C?  Let me see.  A look, not...  Could you take it out?  Yeah, absolutely.  If CM Punk had trouble taking it out, I have no fucking chance.  Thanks.  That's pretty cool, though.  Jimmy, please thrust it into your chest. 
[02:19:30]  Spare us all.  Yeah, why don't you thrust it into my chest?  It says, made in Taiwan.  I don't know if that's...  What do you think?  Let me see.  Hold on.  It looks too new.  I'm not really into the plastic.  The rivets seem a little off.  And the blade, it's too...  Made in Israel.  That's no good.  You're wrong.  This is the part where he would say, I know a Nazi guy.  I'm going to call him, and he's going to come in and take a look at it.  It's in too good condition for the sport. 
[02:20:00]  It's in very good condition.  Now, how did you get it?  I started typing in whatever it says on the blade, and you just kind of go from there.  I do this for a living.  While you were cutting a steak?  He's Chicago's Chumley.  I prefer serrated.  Why don't you round him up, Chum?  What you got there, son?  I am saying fucking false.  It's a plastic handle where back then they were made out of more natural materials, bone and whatnot, 
[02:20:30]  because plastic wasn't really readily available in the World War II era.  You would think, no.  I'm not fucking buying it, sir.  Not buying it.  Oh, get out of my pawn shop.  Wow.  Hold on, see if he's looking at something.  I mean, it's German, but...  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  What, are you ordering a pizza?  Hey, you guys want to hear a good joke?  Terrible.  That was a great visual joke.  You guys want to hear...  I asked the knife.  He's on his phone.  That was a good joke.  The knife said his name is Mac.  No one would get it. 
[02:21:00]  What?  Oh, that's good.  He's Googling it.  He's not giving up.  He wants to Google the knife.  All right, you could Google.  As you're Googling, Danny, what else we got?  Is that it?  Well, I had originally asked for Keith M, and a different Keith had come up.  But if Keith M...  Keith M.  M.  If you don't have a dog skull and your name is Keith.  M as in mutant.  And if we don't have Keith M, it doesn't look like we do.  Is he coming?  Somewhere.  Now he's gone, now?  Maybe he got kicked out?  Too drunk?  All right. 
[02:21:30]  Well, then let's have Taylor M.  Taylor M.  Could you please bring your item to the stage?  Taylor M.  Working his way up.  Oh, good.  That looks like Travis.  Oh.  It was Travis.  There he comes.  Hello, Taylor M.  He's got another framed item.  Jesus Christ.  It's Jesus Christ.  It's actually Jesus Christ.  Very good.  The only way this wins is if it's a self-portrait.  Yes.  It's an actual photo. 
[02:22:00]  It was signed by Pontius Pilate.  I hate this guy.  Wow, that is a portrait of Jesus.  What makes it special?  This was the Jesus painting that Larry David peed on.  In the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode.  Let's put a yarmulke on it.  But is it the actual one?  It is.  It was stage used?  That is.  Wait, how did you get that?  So this guy was a friend of a friend, and he's the props manager for Curb Your Enthusiasm. 
[02:22:30]  And I emailed with him, and I said, I need something cool from this show.  He said, the only thing I can think about is the Jesus painting.  So I paid him about $1,200 for it.  Oh, wow.  And he sent you one of 15 Jesus paintings that they had.  Do you have a COA on that?  What's that?  Well, I had him do this on the back.  What's it say on the back?  Oh, it's written in hand.  This is the picture.  Curb Your Enthusiasm.  This is a picture that was used during Filmy of Curbs season 8. 
[02:23:00]  Limited edition.  Jesus Christ, that was pissed off.  And Jesus Christ.  That's, uh, well.  It is on official Curb Your Enthusiasm letter, Ben.  Oh, it is?  All right, well.  You know, I really don't doubt you, because it's possible.  I mean, you could have gotten it.  But I can't verify it, so I can't put it in my shop.  I mean, it's about as authentic as.  You know what?  CM just wrote.  CM Punk just wrote. 
[02:23:30]  Picture was.  Sir, please.  Oh.  I heard you.  It's a radio show, sir.  Yeah, exactly.  CM Punk wrote, picture was not used in Curb season 8.  Which he's basically saying is as verifiable as the awful handwritten sign.  That is true.  I think the value goes up if he signs that and I put it on the actual.  Jesus signs it.  You know what?  You're right.  He is right.  I don't know.  So what do you guys think?  Oh, wow. 
[02:24:00]  That's learning.  Hey, if we're going to talk about what's real and what isn't, if he had something with a gold seal on it, all of a sudden now it's real?  Yes.  Yeah, I know.  You're right.  You're right.  All right.  So what is it?  So, I mean, look, all it takes, if you really want to get into it, we could actually call the production.  I mean, all the numbers are on there.  We could make a phone call.  Call him and say, it's probably his friend, though.  Oh, yeah, it's real.  I swear, I'm on the Larry David set right now.  Larry, stop.  Sam's got the actual still from the episode.  It looks just like it.  It's probably the same painting, but I mean. 
[02:24:30]  Not to say it couldn't have been one of 30 that they made.  Yeah, exactly.  Like the Kramer.  All right, well.  You know, the Kramer painting.  A lot of people wound up putting that in their fucking house for like a month.  It's not anything I'm going to sell.  I just want it for my own use.  Look, we're not going to buy it.  Exactly.  No one's offering you $1,500.  No, I know it's real because he doesn't give a fuck if you care if it's real.  Right.  He doesn't.  That's how I know it is.  I kind of like that.  I think it is real.  You can care less if you think it's real.  I think it is real.  Well, he believes it's real.  But it's not a matter of not thinking.  I know that you believe it.  A lot of people believe Jesus is real, too. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, shit.  People are going fuck.  We just got religious nuts on this shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  CM Punk.  So why don't we do this?  Why don't we get the three finalists and we'll have the audience decide.  Was that the last of it?  That's the last of it.  That's it.  All right.  That's it.  We had some good stuff here in Chicago.  Oh, yeah.  We're still looking to beat the dead monkey in a bag thing.  Well, you know what?  That was fucked.  Huh?  That got fucked.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot that part.  All that means is that the challenge still remains.  I like that.  I like that part of it. 
[02:25:30]  I don't mind that.  All right.  So where are the three finalists?  We'll have the crowd.  Well, the three finalists are going to be...  I got to go with the dead shoe.  Prophylactic.  Got to go there.  And one of the dog skulls?  Ah.  Danny?  I thought the Larry David painting was going to go over a little harder.  Well, why don't we bring up...  People call bullshit.  Wait a minute.  Why don't we bring up all four and let people vote?  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  They don't call me the solution kid for nothing. 
[02:26:00]  Oh.  I thought that was the oddest thing you own.  Somebody brought up a retard.  All right.  All right.  We're going to bring up the finalists.  Yeah.  And we're talking about the dog skull that was the guy's actual dog.  Oh, yeah.  That was the winning skull.  Family pet.  Yeah.  The Keith M.  Okay.  All right.  Come up.  Come up.  Come up.  Where is everybody?  Move.  Now.  Just go. 
[02:26:30]  Come on.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Bring him up.  What the fuck?  Yeah, man.  God.  Dead shoe.  Oh, boy.  You almost got it.  All right.  Prophylactic, doghead man, fucking Frankenstein, and fucking this guy.  It was fucking Mark Messier.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, man.  This is great.  It's fucking...  We've taken show and tell and put it to a radio show.  Yes.  Very macabre show and tell.  Yes.  Macabry.  I like it. 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Let's vote.  Do you want to go over their heads, Sam?  Yes.  This is Mr. Prophylactic.  Oh, Prophylactic.  Sam doesn't know how to do this.  No.  No.  Everyone knows that would probably be the winner.  No.  He might be right in this one.  What an idiot.  I know.  Last, right?  This is...  Yeah.  Dog skull.  See?  See?  Oh, boy.  This is fake painting.  This is angry bitch. 
[02:27:30]  Wow.  Well, the boo is louder than the yay.  What do we do?  Yeah.  On a noise-o-meter, she would win.  A noise-o-meter.  Very good child of the 80s.  Those two and then have the other two go.  Okay.  Wait.  Oh, good solution, Kenny.  All right.  Whatever.  Process of elimination.  Top two.  You're out of here.  Thank you.  Oh, shit.  Did they even cheer for her?  Oh, 9-11.  No.  I'm annoyed.  Wait a second.  Sam, you think...  He got more noise than her? 
[02:28:00]  No, but she got more booze than him.  No, I think she got more booze.  You don't know how to do this.  Oh, are you doing that?  So we're going noise-o-meter?  We're just going off the volume.  But you think dog skull is more interesting than phony...  No, I think he got less booze.  Now you can't throw him off.  Now you've got to do all three again.  Yeah, let's do all three.  You know what you should have done?  You should have said that was a dog skull from 9-11.  That's what you should have done.  Oh, shit.  The poor puppy was up...  Is it too late to change it?  Windows on the world eating some fucking steak.  All right.  You're not knowing New York motherfuckers.  Who are we starting with? 
[02:28:30]  Her.  Yes.  We're going to end strong, Sam.  From the noise-o-meter.  Trust me on this one.  Who wants the shoe?  Dead lady shoe from 9-11.  Ground zero.  Nothing.  All right.  We got it.  Noise-o-meter.  The dog skull.  It was his family pet, though.  I know.  Fuck him.  Fuck.  And the prophylactic kid.  Squirting fucking fluid up your dickhole.  Wait a minute.  I think you got it.  From World War II. 
[02:29:00]  Sam, you got to mic the lady.  She's not happy.  Oh, shit.  She's writing.  What are you writing?  She's writing a podcast.  He says here, Jim, I'd love to eat your ass.  Oh, jeez.  That's my note for real.  Jim, put it down.  Do you guys...  Hold on a minute.  We have a little lawyer here.  She says the paperwork says you guys decide.  Oh, shit.  I bet you're disclaiming it.  So agreeable.  Well, agreeable.  We're here to grab some stuff.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Oh, yeah.  Go hang out with management.  It's a six-piece disclaimer.  I will say this, though. 
[02:29:30]  All right, look.  We just got a basis of information off the audience.  Now we will decide.  Yes.  We want it...  Take a fucking walk, you bitch.  Oh.  Anthony, is she in third place?  Third place.  Let's hear it for third place.  Dead girl shoe.  We're going to have a grub.  Fucking ground zero.  Well, we wanted to hear the audience's vote before we voted.  Yes.  Stupid lawyer.  All right.  Come on.  I vote for him.  I vote for this guy, too.  Yes. 
[02:30:00]  Fair.  It's got to be prophylactic guy.  Now we voted.  That was a fucking looley.  What do you guys think?  How much did he win?  How much did he win, Sam?  Tell him his prize.  He just won.  $1,000!  $1,000!  $1,000!  $1,000!  Holy shit, buy us all drinks, you're cheap motherfuckers.  From IHateStevenSinger.com.  Thank you, Steven Singer, for $1,000.  It's a great place.  The other side of Walnut Street in Philly, if you happen to be there.  How the fuck does that guy come up with this kind of money?  I think it's Sam Roberts money, right there. 
[02:30:30]  I do know that he's a drug dealer.  All right.  We all know that.  Everyone knows that.  And we are going to be signing after the show, right?  We're going to stick around and sign.  Not anything.  We're just going to talk with our hands.  See, that's...  Oh, fuck.  What a bomb.  Wow.  Well, you know what?  It's time to wrap up.  It sure is.  First of all, I want to thank Chicago for having us.  This fucking rocks.  I want to thank Steven Singer Jewelers.  Visit IHateStevenSinger.com. 
[02:31:00]  Also, keep cheering.  And 115 Bourbon Street for having us.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Thank you to our friend CM Punk for coming down.  Of course.  Thanks for having me, guys.  All the wonderful contestants that participated in our dumb fucking games.  What about Puke Guy?  Thank the vomit...  Where's the vomit man?  Thank the vomit guy.  There he is.  Take your bow, sir.  E-Rock for being a good sport again. 
[02:31:30]  E-Rock who judged the bad breath contest.  Of course, the lovely and talented Sam Roberts who warmed up the crowd.  Well, that's the only reason we're hearing it.  Oh, of course.  We're here for Sam.  We don't know that.  If you ask him...  Of course it is.  It says to me, I went on first.  Somewhere Bob's going, that's right.  That's right.  Yes, right.  Wow.  What a cool crowd.  Wait, we were supposed to end on a big cheer, not a fucking lull.  All right.  And then we've got to go.  Thanks, everyone for coming down.
