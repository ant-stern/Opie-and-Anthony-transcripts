<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts recounting their recent trip to Boston, noting the prevalence of smoking in bars and mentioning a recent anthrax death.  They then shift to Michael Jordan's NBA comeback, criticizing his performance and questioning his age. The conversation moves to the New York Islanders' undefeated season (excluding overtime losses and ties) and the Knicks' lack of competitiveness.  A caller claiming to be Nate Giuliani dedicates a song to New York heroes.  This is followed by a tirade filled with highly offensive language, mocking various radio stations and their programming ("Oh Wow Wednesday," "We Rock Every Hour"), criticizing their lack of creativity, and insulting their management.

A listener calls in to relate their experiences at a similarly formatted radio station.  The show then promotes a Halloween costume contest with World Series tickets as the prize.  Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) calls in to promote his work and discuss his Halloween plans.  The hosts then make offensive jokes about the Afghanistan war and its impact. A Cleveland listener calls about a "WOW" bumper sticker giveaway.  The discussion turns to a news story about a teacher imprisoned for having sex with underage students, prompting further vulgar commentary from the hosts.  Several callers follow, one mentioning a haunted house event benefiting the Twin Towers and Firefighters Fund.  The show continues with more discussion of the Halloween costume contest, further criticism of rival radio stations, and another call from Robert Englund.

A phone call from Robert opens a segment focusing on the Halloween costume contest, with a brief mention of a Mark Wahlberg/Alyssa Milano film.  A visibly intoxicated man dressed as a priest ("Danny Ramone") arrives in the studio, his Mets fandom a source of amusement for the hosts.  A caller, Mike, makes a suggestive comment about costumes. Patty Noonan's letter detailing humorous anecdotes from their recent trips (near-arrests, potential drug possession, a "queer circus") is read, and she then arrives in a poorly executed Superwoman costume.  The hosts discuss a sponsorship for O2Go oxygenated water. A Washington, D.C. listener, D-Dog, calls, and the hosts reveal management's concerns about their behavior on recent trips, potentially jeopardizing their planned D.C. trip. They discuss the repercussions, the post-9/11 climate, and changes in Halloween traditions. More callers contribute anecdotes and humorous interactions, with several contestants arriving for the costume contest: a poorly-wigged Jan Ullrich impersonator and a mullet rocker.

The show then features a segment mocking someone named Voss for buying a used Mercedes, followed by their "Hi Mom" prank call, falsely claiming a listener's son, Mark, is in jail for being with prostitutes, one of whom is a transvestite with AIDS.  The segment focuses on the mother's distressed reaction. A "boob-a-lantern" contest, featuring explicit commentary on breasts and implants, follows, with multiple callers weighing in.  The Halloween costume contest resumes, with contestants including a "drunk priest," "gay bike guy," "mullet rocker," "Osama bin Laden," and "Army guy," appearing in studio or calling in. A female firefighter contestant is a highlight, with the hosts repeatedly suggesting she remove clothing.  The firefighter reveals blemishes on her chest, eliciting a humorous reaction. The topless firefighter ultimately wins the contest via secret ballot.  The show concludes with further discussion of the contest and banter between the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up, man?  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  The boys are home.  Ah, we're home.  What a time we had up in Boston.  Wow, wow, wow.  And anywhere else, including Boston.  Yeah, 866-277-4WOW.  We got back about an hour ago, so yeah, that's it. 
[00:00:30]  Should be an interesting day on the show.  Just drove back.  Pretty tired.  You know, when I was smoking, my throat didn't hurt so much from smoke.  The bars we've been in the past few days, this hacking.  They like their cigs.  Maybe I got the anthrax.  No, you don't have the anthrax?  No, but I hope not.  Now I got to start worrying about that again.  And more people.  Well, now some woman's got it, and she doesn't work in a post office or a government facility. 
[00:01:00]  She don't got it anymore, Ant.  No, she doesn't have it anymore.  Because she's dead.  She's dead.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  Makes me feel good today.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  God, just a few observations.  We left Boston around 10 o'clock this morning.  Yeah.  We were at the Harvard Gardens last night watching the Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Yeah, whatever. 
[00:01:30]  Congrats.  There you go.  Thank you.  Eh, eh.  How you doing?  Ha, how you doing?  Eh, eh.  I was at the bar, too, and all I wanted was them to change the channel so I could see  how Jordan was doing.  Oh, they did for two seconds.  I know, and I'm thinking, you know, this isn't New York.  I think I could get away with it.  No.  And there were enough TVs that were, you know, showing the game in there.  The place went BS.  If you wanted to watch Jordan, find a TV down the bar somewhere.  We were all watching that TV. 
[00:02:00]  The second it changed channel, we were all like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  It was a commercial.  Didn't care.  I wanted to see how Jordan did.  Didn't care.  Did you see any clips of Michael Jordan?  Yeah, yeah, I have a, yeah.  What are you thinking, man?  He, uh, he stunk last night.  He knows it.  Stunk the joint up.  He only shot like 30, 33 percent.  That's not good.  Think it's a mistake for him to come back?  No, not at all.  The problem is everyone was focusing in on his return to the NBA.  Hey, and, uh, you know, now they're thinking he's going to look like that every game of 
[00:02:30]  the season.  Yeah.  It's way too early.  He really was, uh, not up to, up to speed.  You think it's not an age factor or something?  You just think he's rusty?  Uh, it's tough to be, uh, that competitive in the NBA at 38 years old.  Mm-hmm.  But if anyone could do it, he could do it, my friend.  All right.  Well, just don't put it on during any of the, uh, Yankee games.  Let's not forget Nolan Ryan threw his last no-hitter at the age of 44, Anthony.  Ho-ho!  44 years old.  But he didn't keep quitting.  He just, he didn't, you know, Jordan left and come back. 
[00:03:00]  He left and come back.  Mm-hmm.  Just, you know, at least Nolan Ryan just stayed and annoyed everyone.  Being a huge basketball fan, there are two sports that I can't live without, and that's  hockey and basketball.  Milwaukee.  Uh, it was really frustrating to watch, uh, Jordan walk away from the game, you know, when  he had so many great years left.  I mean, you're just not, you're just not born with that type of talent, you know?  And he wasted, what, three years now that he wasn't playing?  He took it for granted, and, you know, ah, it's just so frustrating. 
[00:03:30]  So, I would have gave my left testicle to, to be in the NBA, and here's a guy that, you  know, I mean, he, he accomplished a lot of things, and then, then he walks away from  the game when he had so many good years left.  But again, he killed me.  He can't do a funny radio program.  Oh.  You can't play in the NBA, he can't be entertaining for four hours a day.  I give up this radio show tomorrow to play in the NBA, for one season.  I was obsessed with basketball growing up.  Your other love, uh, hockey.  Yeah.  Now, uh, is it true the Islanders are indeed in first place? 
[00:04:00]  Where have you been?  Okay, I'm just making sure.  The Islanders are for real this year.  They won last night?  Again, yeah, they're 9-0, 1-1.  One, 9-0, 1-1.  They have not lost the game.  Where are the two ones from?  In regulation.  They have not lost the game this year yet, Anthony.  So, one for a tie, in the tie section, what, and one in the, uh, overtime loss?  It's the OL category, yeah.  But what's the other one?  You said 9-0, 1-1.  Well, you got, uh, nine wins?  Zero.  Zero losses. 
[00:04:30]  Losses, okay.  One, OL.  All right.  It's a loss in overtime.  Uh-huh.  And one, tie.  Tie, okay.  Why is there an overtime loss then?  I don't get it.  Why is that?  It's a new category in the NHL.  Would have been a loss.  It's, it's stupid, is what it is.  It gives them the opportunity to get a few more points there.  Well, they changed that, too.  You know, the game's over, uh, you know, it's tied after regulation.  Both teams get a point.  Right, both teams get a point.  And then, however it ends in overtime... 
[00:05:00]  They either both have a point, or if one wins and they get two, it's, it's kind of silly.  It's like the Special Olympics, Jim.  Everyone's a winner.  Everyone walks away with a ribbon or a little, little trophy.  That big-headed, big-tongued trophy.  You know what I mean.  But more than that, Jordan's stinking up the joint.  The Knicks, uh, did not look that good, either.  That's your team.  They won by, what, two points?  I mean, I, uh, you know, ugh.  Well, Washington has a horrible basketball team. 
[00:05:30]  Horrible.  Well, it was nice to see, uh, the Yankees emerge victorious in the very important, uh, game three last night.  It was a little frightening.  Where are we?  Here we go.  Jim loves this song.  Hey, Joey Baseballs.  How you doing?  Oh, I'm doing so much.  How you doing?  Listen, we just got a phone call from Nate Giuliani.  No, you didn't.  He wanted to do a little something special for the Yankees.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is going to go out to all the heroes in New York.  There you go.  Here it is. 
[00:06:00]  New York, how you doing?  Ah, it's embarrassing being a Yankee fan.  With a song like this, isn't it?  The fact that no girls are dancing to this in Brooklyn.  Ah.  How you doing?  With the big hair.  26.  All right.  The pinstripes.  I can't deal with that today.  That's pretty funny, though.  When the Yankees win, that's all you got to do.  Like, we're sitting at the bar and stuff.  We're just sitting watching the game.  And all you got to do is look at Rick and just go, ah, ah. 
[00:06:30]  You know the Yankees are doing well.  All right.  So, uh, some more observations.  So, we left and took the road trip back to New York.  And, uh, right off the bat, radio is god-awful.  It is god-awful.  Yeah, there's stuff going on.  It's horrid.  I feel pretty good about what we do after listening to what everyone else is doing.  Slow down.  Because I was spinning the dial trying to find something interesting.  Yeah.  There was a station outside Hartford, WHCN, I believe.  Yeah.  That, uh, Norton was pranking like crazy because their new great idea is, oh, wow, Wednesday. 
[00:07:00]  What?  Yeah.  They call Wednesdays, oh, wow, Wednesday.  Like O-H?  Oh.  Like O, or just the letter O?  Oh, wow, Wednesday.  Oh, wow, Wednesday.  Which basically means they play classic rock that rocks.  What?  I don't get the concept.  It's these songs that make you go, wow.  Wow.  Oh, oh, wow.  And it's classic rock? 
[00:07:30]  Like, oh, wow, credence.  So, Norton, because he was bored S-less in my car, and he's on the cell phone just messing  with management at the station.  Really?  Why are you calling it, oh, wow, Wednesday?  It doesn't make sense.  It stinks.  That's a lot of messages.  What does it mean?  Really annoyed me.  No one says, oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  It's nicer than probably they normally have, which is, ugh, Monday and Tuesday and blech,  Thursday and Friday.  I flipped on our old station up there in Boston, Anthony, the one we got fired from. 
[00:08:00]  Ah, yes, yes, AAF, yes.  Don't worry.  We'll move on to other things today, because we have focused a lot on Boston lately.  But, like, so we're on WBCN, you know, which is in competition with our old station.  It's really a joke at this point.  Anyway, this is how they're trying to compete against what you and I are doing in Boston.  Yeah.  Every song, they have a sweeper come on.  A production element, Anthony?  Yes.  A production element.  A production element. 
[00:08:30]  It's called a production element in the biz.  Sure.  It gives you a little info about the station.  A little info.  Wow, I just sounded like Dane Cook a little bit.  I did, right?  And their new thing is that they rock every hour.  Wait, wait.  They rock every hour.  They rock every hour.  Oh, every hour.  Every hour.  Every hour.  They rock every hour.  They rock 24-7, and that means they rock every hour.  So it says, we rock every hour. 
[00:09:00]  Every hour.  All right.  Wow, how about that?  Dave Dickless, you tool.  I'm thinking we rock every hour.  That's a great idea to compete against us.  And they slam it down your throat.  We rock every hour.  Every hour.  Meaning WBCN talks a little bit.  Oh, that's what it is.  Basically telling your jocks that they stink and they should keep their mouth shut and just play the music.  That's what that means.  And between 3 and 7, we rock whole every hour.  With rock whole.  Schlock whole. 
[00:09:30]  Every hour.  That's their next great idea.  Did he call them all into the conference room when a kid thought up this idea and put the big blackboard up and start writing on it?  We rock every hour.  There it is, people.  Look at it.  And I want you to have passion for this.  Passion is so important in...  Remember sitting in the meetings with that tool? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, ponderous.  With his blackboard and his chalk.  See, where I'm writing here is I'm a dick.  You have to have passion for what a dick I am.  Dick.  Just so everyone is involved all over the country.  Because we're syndicated.  A couple things about radio.  If you work for a station that brags that they rock every hour or they play 50 minutes of music every hour. 
[00:10:30]  What does that say?  Another rock block coming next.  We don't stop the music.  We don't stop the music.  Thank you, Anthony.  A lot of them use that one.  That means you, as a radio personality, a DJ, is useless.  You're completely useless.  You're a monkey that pushes buttons.  What that is telling the air staff?  Management is pretty much telling the air staff, 
[00:11:00]  look, I don't feel you are capable of entertaining the people that are listening to this show  with anything more than just pressing that button and playing your CD.  Right.  When you say, we only stop the rock twice an hour.  That means, Jesus, please shut up.  That means we're going to stop twice because we've got to play some commercials.  And yeah, the DJ is going to babble for 30 seconds about nothing.  Yeah.  And we apologize for that.  If we could, we wouldn't stop at all. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Pretty much it.  That's what that means.  Yeah.  So for our old station to say, we rock every hour.  It pretty much means we have no confidence in the people that work for this station.  That's right.  Tools.  Just play your music.  Hit those buttons.  Make sure you're running the tape.  So once a week, you could sit in there with Dave Dickless and he can critique every word  that came out of your mouth. 
[00:12:00]  Imagine the likes of that bean pulled schmuck with his 70s porno, gay porno mustache sitting  across from you and hitting play.  There's what you're doing on your show.  You yap for your 30 seconds going into a song and he stops the tape and goes, you're going  to have to tighten that up a little bit.  I want you to, I want you to put a picture of, of somebody at a magazine who you feel your 
[00:12:30]  listener is.  Cut a picture out of somebody you feel is your listener and put it up in front of you.  And that's the person you're talking to.  Get one idea out there.  Oh yeah.  And make sure it either makes someone laugh or gives them some information.  Jim, program directors do this to their DJs.  Nobody ever said to look at a picture, did they?  Swear to God, Dave Dickless.  You know, he's not the only one.  This is something that a lot of programmers tell their staff.  Get a picture of someone you could talk to.  So you're talking to that person. 
[00:13:00]  I want a big picture of a vagina in front of me.  I just want to talk to a big, sloppy.  If your program, if your program director tells you to do that.  Yeah.  You might as well get a big picture of your mule.  Yeah.  Your junk.  Someone else's junk because you suck.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Would it be possible, like for, for when I talk to have a picture of the, uh, the JonBenet  Ramsey corpse?  That'd be nice to chat to for a little while. 
[00:13:30]  Dave, I took your advice.  Dave, I got, I got a picture of you, okay?  I got a picture of you up there because I like talking to you.  Well, thank you, Rockhole.  Thank you, Schlockhole.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Steal some more tickets from my officer.  Give him away this week.  Hey, guys, what's up?  All right, Dave, thank you.  Another week of employment.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Uh, AAF is also playing a commercial, uh, talking about how that because BCN and Boston 
[00:14:00]  play so much talk that you should advertise with AAF because they're music and that's  what people listen to.  Yeah, yeah, they actually have to, uh, you know, well, the bottom line is, uh, a lot of  people jumping ship over there coming over to the Opie and Anthony show on BCN.  Jimmy, that's the way they got to sell it because they can't sell ratings because we're  kicking their ass out.  Well, yeah, that's, that's, if you were advertising, wouldn't you want to advertise where  100,000 people listen rather than?  Two or three people listen? 
[00:14:30]  Uh, no, give them credit, about two or three thousand maybe.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you, you, you might want to advertise on the station people are listening to.  I think that's pretty basic, pretty understandable.  You don't have to be, uh, uh, economics major to figure out that if you're spending money on  advertising, you want it to get out to as many people as possible, not the people that  are listening to music.  Well, I, I don't understand what that's all about.  Hey, listen, uh, if you're going to buy airtime, buy it here where we play music. 
[00:15:00]  What?  It's just, uh, you know, the, the business is filled with a bunch of program directors that  just, they suck.  It's just, they have no creativity.  Desperation.  They follow each other.  There's no visionaries out there anymore.  They're pathetic.  Absolutely pathetic.  Okay.  Here I am in a meeting.  Wait a minute.  I'm writing this.  We are effed.  That's right, people.  We're effed.  Say it after me.  We are effed.  We're effed.  We're effed.  Repeat after me with passion. 
[00:15:30]  Opie and Anthony are kicking our ass and we don't know what to do.  Passion.  When he wrote that on that board, he, I swear to God, we're in this conference room.  He writes in big letters, passion.  And then stands there and doesn't say anything.  Like he's got this whole drama, uh, uh, thought out beforehand.  He writes passion on the board and then stands back and looks at the word and looks at us.  Like, okay, people now soak it in and wait for my thrilling Midwestern rube tool speech  about passion.  And I'm just thinking, I am passionate about how much I hate this son of a bitch. 
[00:16:00]  That's the passion I had in me.  Passion for the music.  We want passion for the station.  Passion.  Shut up.  Ugh.  And shave that mustache off.  If you do 92-minute rock blocks, that means you get to talk for a total of, uh, three or four times  during your show for a total of two minutes.  Do the math.  Exactly.  That means you stink and your boss has no confidence in you.  And when your boss says, hey, uh, Opie and Anthony are going to be kicking your ass, 
[00:16:30]  but, um, don't talk about them, okay?  Just sit back.  Let them just pound you into oblivion.  And, uh, you just sit there.  Can you tell we didn't sleep last night?  Yeah, okay, Dave.  I'll take your word for it, Dave.  We're very feisty today.  Yeah.  Mike from Cleveland, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, yeah, the other Infinity here in town, the, uh, the classic rock station, 
[00:17:00]  they're doing, uh, seven-song classic rock blocks.  Seven-song classic rock blocks?  Yeah, last month or so.  That's cute.  There you go.  Nice.  That'll get people listening.  Yeah, they love it over there.  How many bad Steely Dan and Van Morrison songs do you have to listen to when those rock blocks are on?  Oh, all right.  That was a pleasurable answer.  Norton, Norton.  Let's go to Craig.  Craig, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, how you doing?  Pretty good, man. 
[00:17:30]  There's a station right outside Philadelphia.  It's in, like, the mountains right outside Philadelphia.  They do, um, Oh Well Wednesday.  The concept of Oh Well Wednesday is you request a song you ever heard in a long time, and they play it.  They don't play it.  And they say, Oh Wow.  Oh Wow.  Wow, I can't believe my station is playing it.  The classic rock station does the seven-song rock blocks in here, too.  Like, too many awful friggin' Marley Simon songs.  We're going with Oh Wow.  Rocco, you'll start it up at three. 
[00:18:00]  It'll be Oh Wow, What a Tool I Am.  They'll put, like, a Molly Hafton song in here, like, Oh Wow.  Oh Wow.  Banana.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  All right, see that stuff.  See it.  All right, Greg.  Do you know when you say, Oh Wow, when you have a relative in the car and she leans over  and drinks out of your mule unexpectedly?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  What the F?  There you go.  It's What the F Tuesday.  What the F?  Get your thumb out of my can Thursday or something. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, wow.  That'll surprise you.  That's a wow.  How about Golly G Thursday?  Where the DJ says something witty for once and you just have to go, Golly G.  Rib tickling Tuesday.  Deuce or drizzy.  Yeah, so we came to the conclusion, yeah, that radio stinks.  It's just funny, you know, I mean, come on. 
[00:19:00]  We rock every hour.  Who cares, you idiot?  No, be passionate about that.  We rock every hour.  If they want to put Opie and Anthony on at three to seven, to take all of Schlocko's  listeners away, who cares?  We have to be passionate about the five listeners that are left.  All right, we're going to take our first break.  We're just getting started.  Oh, you know what?  We've got to run down everything we're doing today.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  We've got to get it started now.  It's Halloween.  Yeah, it's Halloween.  Ooh.  We'll do our cute Halloween break next.  Next, where's my opium?  Eddie.  Eddie.  I don't feel good, Eddie.  I love that movie.  I like to wear women's underclothes.  I wear women's underwear.  Bella?  We're going to make a movie, Bella.  Eddie.  I need my opium, Eddie. 
[00:20:00]  That was the best thing.  Martin Landau.  Ah!  And he's flopping around with the octopus that they stole in that lake.  Oh, by the way, we've got to give...  Karloff.  F. Boris Karloff.  We've got to give props to Cleveland.  They came up with the WOW bumper stickers.  Yeah.  They got some made.  I don't know where they're handing them out.  Maybe you could start sending self-addressed stamped envelopes to the Cleveland radio station  to get your WOW bumper stickers.  Okay.  A bunch of things going on, Anthony. 
[00:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  The Booble Lantern contest, the qualifying is over.  You could start voting for your favorite Booble Lantern.  Yep.  We've got to give away $1,000 for first place.  Okay?  You go to opiumanthony.com and start that.  You vote.  We still...  And we just put up pictures from Chris Robinson being in the studio yesterday when we were  up in Boston.  Mm-hmm.  So we have a bunch of brand new pictures that show that.  Okay?  opiumanthony.com.  Vote for Booble Lantern.  We're assuming a lot of people came to work today dressed in cute little Halloween costumes. 
[00:21:00]  That bugs me.  We have a pair of tickets to Game 4 of the World Series.  Oh!  Look at this.  Featuring the New York Yankees versus the Arizona Diamondbacks.  I did not know that.  That's who's while playing?  Really?  Wow.  Okay.  Good.  That's what I heard, yeah.  Where is it?  Well, it says right here at Yankee Stadium. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, that's convenient.  I was thinking they might just for a goof play at Shea.  You mean in New York?  Why not?  Huh?  In New York?  In New York, I think.  In New York.  Tickets courtesy of Budweiser, Budweiser, the king of beers, and Major League Baseball.  All right.  All right.  This is what we're going to do for the tickets for tonight's game.  Mm-hmm.  I hope this isn't too stupid.  It's probably kind of stupid, but it's a way of interacting with our audience.  Yeah.  It's giving people things to do on Halloween. 
[00:22:00]  Best Halloween costume that shows up at our studio.  Judged by us alone.  So if it's stupid, we're going to throw you out.  I don't like it.  How about the guy that can best hide a razor blade in a chocolate bar?  Oh, God.  Best Halloween costume.  Because we just got back into town.  We don't know what else to do, okay?  Oh, please.  You got until now.  From now until 6 o'clock to give you time to get over to Yankee Stadium and get through security and all that. 
[00:22:30]  So...  That'll take you a while.  Contest ends at 6.  Looking for the best Halloween costume.  You just show up at the station.  Just for showing up, we'll find some stuff to give you, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  But the best costume will win.  Tickets for tonight's game at the stadium.  Do we have candy?  So if they come in and trick-or-treat, we can give them some?  We'll just throw on that.  Throw frozen Snickers at people's heads.  Use condoms.  Nice.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  Wasn't there something else we were supposed to do today?  Uh... 
[00:23:00]  We'll figure it out.  We got to regroup.  Stay there.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Hey!  This is Robert Englund here, a.k.a.  Freddy Krueger, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  It's getting into the Halloween spirit, huh, Anthony? 
[00:23:30]  Yes!  Dragula!  Rob Zombie.  Zombie.  Zombie.  Zombie.  You know what I'm getting annoyed with on the news on a daily basis?  I like that we're bombing.  Believe me, I enjoy the bombing of Afghanistan.  But, uh, that every day now, they go, and last night was the heaviest bombing since the campaign started.  And they're saying that now every night, which leads me to believe that either the,  he started this thing off with like a firecracker, with like nothing, or by now we should be dropping atomic weapons on. 
[00:24:00]  It's, it's the same, like, I'm like, oh, good, the, the, the most powerful bombing of the campaign so far.  And then they say the same thing again tomorrow.  And I see a few clips of some mountains blowing up.  I like the explosions.  The night ones are good.  They throw off a nice light.  But, uh, I want more.  I need more.  You know what the other thing is?  What? 
[00:24:30]  You know, we're dropping the food and stuff.  Yeah.  This is the truth.  We're giving the Afghanis, the Afghanistan people.  The Afghanis?  Afghanis.  Afghanis?  Yeah.  Uh, we're giving them the runs, Anthony.  Are we?  Swear to God.  Yeah, that must be nice.  Thank God they're such hygienic people.  They're kind of, they're kind of complaining and bitching.  And they got a good argument.  Hear me out here.  They're, they're, they're not used to, uh, processed food.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're, you know, everything they eat is very from the land, quite literally. 
[00:25:00]  Some of them eat rocks and sticks and stuff.  But, I mean, it's very, very basic.  Yeah.  They have a very basic diet.  You know, they don't have the White Castle and the, and the Mickey D's and all that stuff.  So now we're dropping all this stuff?  We're dropping peanut butter and jelly and Pop-Tarts.  Pop-Tarts and this stuff is just making them crap like they've never seen.  Maybe it's part of the campaign.  In the heaviest crapping of the campaign, Afghanis dumping mud all over Afghanistan. 
[00:25:30]  And you know they're not using baby wipes or anything like that after a rough bout.  Well, they're bitching, they're like, come on, help us out a little bit.  We appreciate your, you're dropping the food, but maybe something that we can digest would be nice.  They're probably doing it into their hands and then just washing off with it.  Oh, God.  Tired of this little pussy campaign, civilian debt. 
[00:26:00]  Why don't we just drop little, uh, little please don't bomb us again letters with balloons attached to them.  Enough.  We apologize when the civilians are killed.  You know, we're not targeting it.  We feel bad about any, don't feel so bad.  What happened to good old-fashioned carpet bombing with incendiary bombs that start that big firestorm?  I like that.  Then they can't even count the dead.  We got to check in with Cleveland because we were talking about the WOW stickers.  The WOW bumper stickers have made it to Cleveland.  Ah, good.  Who's this, Foz? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, this is Foz.  What's up, guys?  Speakerphone Foz?  Yeah, I'm running your show right now, actually.  Out of Cleveland?  Yeah.  Thank you.  What's going on?  Uh, tonight we'll be at the Hard Rack Cafe for a battle of the bands.  We'll be giving WOW stickers away there.  Uh, is the Hard Rack Cafe, uh, associated with the Hard Rock Cafe that we have here in New York?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's one of the branches of Hard Rock.  All right.  I thought it was just, you know, a little, you know, copycat club.  No, it's actually a Hard Rock. 
[00:27:00]  All right, so you guys will be giving out bumper stickers at the Hard Rack Cafe.  Yeah.  In, uh, Cleveland.  Uh, what time tonight, Foz?  Uh, we'll be there from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. tonight.  Okay.  And then we'll be at, uh, at the McDonald's on the corner of Route 8 and 271 in Northfield.  And we'll have them there tomorrow, too.  All right, cool.  At 5 p.m.  Sounds great, man.  Thanks for helping us out.  No problem, guys.  All right, peace.  Later.  All right.  Drop some WOW stickers on Afghanistan.  That'll help out the cause.  You know, we went off on that radio, uh, radio station rant and stuff. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Forgot to mention, and you guys could all back me up on it, because I'm sure you guys  are spinning the dials on the way home.  How many radio stations had Halloween theme hours?  Yeah.  For lunchtime.  Yeah, that's nice.  Hey, let's play Edgar Winter Frankenstein.  Oh, hey.  Oh, ho.  How about the Monster Mash?  I heard the Monster Mash.  I heard Boris the Spider.  Now, that's reaching deep.  You're breaking out Boris the Spider so you can look cool for Halloween. 
[00:28:00]  And the snakes and snails and puppy dog tails.  That's great, Bella.  I just wanted to, I was reading something.  I just wanted to give you a giggle.  Teacher gets four years on student sex rap.  It's in the post.  Oh, yeah?  And, uh, it's, uh, Marcy Stein, 30, 14 and 16 years old from her special education classes.  Oh, man. 
[00:28:30]  The lady?  Yeah.  Humming tarts.  Is that great?  I forgot my homework.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  How great is that?  That is, uh, usually hot.  It's never the female teachers.  Dude, I wish I would have had one like that.  That is usually hot.  Well, and, uh, except when you throw the retards in.  But whenever you hear the teacher and, uh, she's at the students.  Female teacher, that's just a nympho.  You just kind of think back at school.  Maybe one of the hot teachers you went to school with and kind of think about that.  That was my dream growing up and going to, like, Oldfields Junior High School. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Hoping one of my teachers was a goer.  Yeah.  Because that's just like, you read the stories.  You ever see that?  Like, that, uh, that one woman that, uh, got pregnant by one of the students.  And then there was that other one that she, um, she was having sex and had one of the students kill her husband.  Oh, that's, uh, uh, Pam, uh, Smart.  Yeah, Smart from New Hampshire, Anthony.  And, uh, those stories are great.  And it just conjures up something kind of great erotic about it.  Oh, those are the hottest made-for-TV movies. 
[00:29:30]  This is even better, though, just because they were tarts.  And, you know, she couldn't get enough of their just fat tart junk.  And that was what Loretta wrote.  She just had to give them oral treats.  What a good girl.  She was doing these poor kids a service.  She got a face.  She should be principal after that.  If you could do that to make these kids happy.  Just think of what they're going to be like the rest of their lives.  Going like, ah, that was great.  I want more.  Yeah.  More!  You know, running around like a bunch of kooks.  I like that.  That felt good.  That felt good. 
[00:30:00]  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again!  Do it again!  Do it again!  Don't bang your head.  Don't bang your head.  Do it again!  Do it again!  Big fat junk like a big piece of liverwurst.  Parents got to explain why you can't just go around trying to put it in other people's mouths.  Let's say hi to Brother Joe.  What's up, Joe?  You know, I heard you guys talking about Afghanistan before.  Sorry to bring you away from the tarts getting laid. 
[00:30:30]  That's all right.  But I read something in the paper today about the colors of the food packets.  They're the same yellow color as unexploded cluster bomblets.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I read it today.  And they're like sending out these leaflets that are warning people to only pick up the square packets and don't try to open the cylindrically shaped ones.  So, it's the same exact color as unexploded bomblets.  The same color yellow as the... 
[00:31:00]  That's no one in Washington that has a really good sense of humor.  As what?  The anti-personnel cluster bombs?  Yes.  That's great.  And the unexploded bomblets, because you know how those things work, right?  Yeah.  This is great.  They have a bunch of little bomblets over a wide area.  So, what is it?  Like, I hear they're...  Are they the ones that have the flechettes in them?  Yes.  This is great.  They explode above the ground.  And they can cover an area about the size of a football field?  Yeah.  No further than like a foot apart.  A foot apart with just these dart-like flechettes that they're anti-personnel. 
[00:31:30]  So, they just lay these things out.  They explode and go through people that are on the ground.  They're like common nails with fins on them.  Yeah.  And they will just go through you.  Yeah.  As you walk and boom, something explodes above you.  So, now that some of these unexploded ones are laying on the ground waiting for some  Haji to go pick it up because he thinks it's a Twinkie.  I'm trying to eat it.  I'm trying to eat it.  I thought I'd just throw that at you, guys. 
[00:32:00]  Very good.  I'm not sure that's next to dental.  Thanks, man.  Okay, guys.  See you later.  All right.  Eric, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, what's up?  What's up?  Not only are we giving them the runs with the peanut butter and stuff, but a lot of them don't  know what it is, so they're playing with it like the kids.  They don't know what peanut butter is.  They play with it.  They just eat, you know, like donkey or whatever.  Hey, Eric, thanks.  Okay.  Silly putty or something.  Hey, Bob, what's going on? 
[00:32:30]  Bobby.  Hello.  Hey, old A.  What's up, man?  Can you hear me?  My phone's crapping out.  We got you.  All right.  Hey, you guys were rocking up in Boston, man.  Let me tell you.  We had two really fun shows, man.  I'm down here in Jersey.  You guys have got it wrong, though.  That teacher wasn't doing tarts, you know?  They were just like regular high school kids and stuff from what the paper said.  It said special education.  Well, the dude, it said out of her special education classes. 
[00:33:00]  It did.  That's why I thought it was really funny.  I mean, oral is always lovely, but when you're doing it to a tart, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  What did she look like, though?  Oh, she had to be.  Hold on, dude.  I'm looking right now.  Oral, from her special education classes.  But what did she look like?  Oh, I don't know.  There's no picture.  She's probably a big fatty.  She's probably a three.  Yeah, maybe a three and a half.  That's got to be something.  I wish I had something like that, you know?  In school, you would have been telling everybody, right? 
[00:33:30]  I can't think of a guy alive that would tell his parents or the authorities if he was 14  years old and his hot French teacher wanted to give him a little action after class.  You know what it is?  They tell their friends, and then the friends tell people.  And that's how anyone got caught doing anything bad in high school.  But if it's a female with a male teacher, it's a whole different story.  Dude, I wouldn't tell him.  I don't have stinky drink out of my mule.  Hey, you guys rock, man.  Talk to you later.  Thanks, Bob.  A lot of, you know, you'd think a lot of kids would go, hey, I'll take you over to the 
[00:34:00]  teacher, man.  You go, hey, you service this guy, or I'm telling him.  Before you know it, she's hobbing like crazy.  And you are the most popular kid in school.  You're whoring out your own teacher.  It's 11-year-old Gary.  Gary, Gary, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, Gary.  Hey.  Sorry I haven't been talking to you on vacation, Mike.  No, you're too busy, you know, spending time on the Ron and Fez.  Oh, come on.  Don't do that to me, man.  You know that we're fans of the Ron and Fez show after us here in New York, and I'm 
[00:34:30]  listening to Gary every night on the Ron and Fez show.  Did you hear what I said yesterday?  Huh?  Did you hear what I said yesterday about Melissa?  What'd you say?  She's the one.  I mean, she's the best.  Melissa's the best?  And she even said I was the best.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  I just wanted to say, I will come in.  You'll come in?  But do you want me to be, do you have the TV in there?  Why?  Because I would bring my Dreamcast.  You'd bring your Dreamcast so you could play. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  If you, no, I'll buy a controller for you guys.  I'm more, I'm more of a PlayStation 2 guy.  No, I'll, I don't have PlayStation 2.  Xbox.  Excuse me.  I thought, I thought you were going to come in to beat up Anthony, the 11-year-old Gary.  Well, that's what I'll do.  When he's playing NBA 2K, I'll smack him in his head.  Hey, how was Halloween today, Gary?  I'm sick of it already.  What are you doing?  Are you going to trick or treat?  What?  I just want, I just want to plug something.  Yeah.  I don't even think it's saying it. 
[00:35:30]  Go ahead.  I'm plugging a haunted house in Seaport.  Why?  One of the, it was named one of the scariest on Long Island, um, charity for Twin Towers and the Firefighters Fund.  So.  And you're going to be there?  Uh, yes, I'm going tonight.  Are you going to be scaring people, Gary?  I don't mark this.  Don't do that thing that happens every year where the kid decides he's going to put his head through the noose and scare people.  And they don't know it's an act and the kid usually winds up dead. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, that's, that's a nice answer to me.  Well, I'm saying don't do that.  Gary, did you pick out a cute costume for yourself?  Nope, no costumes.  The only costume I wore, today we had a parade.  To show off that boyish figure?  No.  Today we had a parade.  What a half shirt.  They had categories.  Yeah.  I dressed up as sport nut.  Yankees.  Just Yankees.  Sports nut.  Sports nut?  I wasn't even a sports nut.  I wasn't even a sports guy.  You know what I'm dressing up as, Gary?  What?  Nothing, because I have to perform at Rascals. 
[00:36:30]  I thought you were going to dress up as an M&M.  Oh, you are.  I can't dress up.  I'll be performing tonight.  Well, I thought you were going to dress up as an M&M.  Why an M&M?  Because he has one.  No, I thought he had a clever joke there.  I was helping him with the setup.  I thought it just popped off my mind.  Hey, Gary.  Did I melt in my pants?  Gary, I must say you're funnier on Ron and Fez's show.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  I'm not good today, and nothing will.  You don't have the anthrax, do you? 
[00:37:00]  No.  All right.  All right, Gary.  We're going to let you go, all right?  All right.  See you.  All right, bye.  Speaking of really fast, Anthony, because Jim Norton had to plug his gig tonight.  Of course.  Jim Norton's plugs are getting out of hand.  A few people noticed this.  Let me read one of them.  We have a lot of pictures from our Boston trip up at opiananthony.com.  Also, you could start voting for your favorite boobo lantern.  We've got to give away that $1,000.  You can vote between now and Friday.  End of the show Friday, we will pick a winner, okay? 
[00:37:30]  Cool.  A couple emails.  I noticed the rascals' telephone number under Jim Cook's buds.  Jesus, Norton, will the plugs ever cease?  Ah.  On the pictures from BCM, yeah.  We've got dozens of these.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Who is this?  Michael writes, hey, was it on purpose that in the section showing Jim Cook's hops,  they were laid out on a piece of paper with rascals' number on it?  Pouring for Jim by Jim.  Isn't that great?  These people notice everything. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, they're ridiculous.  Great.  Mike D. from Stowe, Ohio.  Yeah.  Sent me this link from CNN.  It's a little Halloween theme, a little student theme we've been talking about.  Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee.  Teenagers may have outgrown their fear of ghouls and goblins,  but health officials believe their haunted house has something far scarier.  Gonorrhea and genital warts.  That's right.  Hoping to combat one of the nation's highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases.  In Nashville, Tennessee? 
[00:38:30]  That is one of the highest rates of a genital warts and gonorrhea?  They're staging the STD-free haunted house.  As visitors make their way through a dimly lit S-shaped maze,  they view startling full-color photos of canker sores and genital warts on male and female genitalia  infected with syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea.  An empty casket.  Yeah.  Yum.  An empty casket at the end sends a message that death awaits anyone who doesn't practice safe sex.  They want to scare the pants back on, said one of these nurses. 
[00:39:00]  And I got some audio from the haunted house as you're walking through.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  Wow, that's scary.  Wow.  How scary would that be?  Woo.  I think I got a little more here.  I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  First of all, you remove the condom from its package.  Then you find which way the condom rolls out, put it in your mouth, and apply. 
[00:39:30]  Well, same sex.  Oh, sure.  What's that?  You go around a darkly lit corner and all of a sudden it jumps out at you?  Butt sex.  Oh, my God.  That's frightening.  Big picture of that edge.  Woo.  Frightening.  Vagina.  Whoa.  Stop it.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Ah.  The wraparound bud grab.  Whoa.  Hey, hey.  That is a scary little haunted house, isn't it?  Hey, hey. 
[00:40:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  See, your name's Gary Falker.  What is this in the little pedophile corner of the other?  Yeah.  Like having your background.  Ah, that can only lead to something bad.  Wow.  Very scary.  They're really doing that in Nashville?  Yes.  It's an STD haunted house.  Are they college students?  What's scarier than shankers and canker sores and chlamydia?  It's coming right for us.  Right.  Run, run, run. 
[00:40:30]  Haunted house visitors are given goodie bags filled with brochures on sexually transmitted diseases  and can get a free STD test when they complete the maze.  This is less fun than previously indicated.  No S.  It was developed three years ago, the haunted house, after Nashville reported the second  highest rate of syphilis in the country.  Oh, my no!  So, there it is.  Very good.  The STDs.  Boo, Eddie. 
[00:41:00]  Eddie, I have crabs, Eddie.  That's okay, Bella.  I have crabs, too.  Hey, how many people are here with their costumes?  Ah, we got any, uh...  None.  Stinky?  Stinky's running in like there might be some excitement outside the studio.  Stinky?  Stinky?  Yeah.  How many costumes have showed up for our little, quick little contest today?  There was a guy downstairs on the X-Security, if he had a costume, he was like, no.  But, apparently he does, so...  Maybe the security thought it was just, uh, weird or something. 
[00:41:30]  All right, you got it, uh, from, uh, now until 6 o'clock, uh, the best costume that stops  by the station today will win tickets to tonight's game at Yankee Stadium.  Right.  World Series.  World Series tickets, courtesy of Budweiser.  Budweiser, the king of beers and Major League Baseball.  Uh, best costume that shows up, we'll decide.  Us three, okay?  Norton, Ant, and I.  All right.  Dan from Hoboken's wondering if the pictures of the sexually transmitted diseases at the  haunted house, uh, are a tour of Norton's medical records. 
[00:42:00]  Could that be, Norton?  Uh, Shanker, some pussy little wound on, uh, part of your anatomy?  I had, uh, I had had AIDS a couple of times, but I beat it with, uh, Theraflu.  Theraflu?  Who knew?  Well, thank God.  More audio from the haunted house.  We don't want your AIDS!  Yeah.  Of course not.  Pusa!  Whoa, look at that!  Pusa!  Pusa!  Oh, it's coming at us!  Your slats! 
[00:42:30]  And, uh, here's when you ask the guy, uh, well, my God, where did you get that huge  canker sore on, uh, in your lap?  I got it from a Negro.  Oh, my God.  Chilling.  Uh, Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man, I'm, uh, down in Washington, D.C.  I wanted to find out if you guys were coming down on Monday or not.  Well, uh, that's interesting you, uh, bringing that up.  You're on double secret probation.  Why don't we, Steve, why don't we take a break and we'll talk about, uh, Washington, D.C. 
[00:43:00]  next.  How's that sound?  All right, all right.  Well, all right.  That's fine.  Management, uh, is a little worried about us taking any more road trips.  Yeah.  Oh, come on, guys.  They're getting, they're getting, let's just say, a little leery about, uh, sending us on  the road these days because of, uh, they may be on to us.  Defense, yeah.  So, Steve, uh, we got to take a break and we'll, we'll talk about it next because we're  really late, okay?  All right, man.  All right.  Well, we may have a problem.  We may have a problem.  Maybe we can work this out, all right? 
[00:43:30]  Also, uh, he just called in, he hung up, but I'm sure he'll call back very soon.  Robert England, Anthony.  Oh.  Freddy Krueger himself.  And a letter from Stalker Patty has just been handed to me.  Yeah, what do you got?  Uh, I'd like to read it next.  A little welcome back to New York letter.  We've got it in two days.  It's like a weekend.  We've got a weekend, Patty.  Don't worry.  Jesus.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:44:00]  Who else gives you a bus filled with naked teens that you can see from the streets of  Manhattan?  What a day for new teens.  Oh, come on.  They can't arrest the voyeur bus.  Billy Johnny, read it.  Disturbed.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Down with the sickness.  Yeah.  Oh.  I was jamming this CD in the car on the way home from Boston, Anthony.  Yeah, the guy, uh...  He's a great singer for someone with Tourette's. 
[00:44:30]  That's right.  I like it.  I'll just out of nowhere go...  Our first costume has arrived, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  What is it?  Best costume today.  We'll win tickets to tonight's World Series game at Yankee Stadium, courtesy of Budweiser,  the King of Beers, and Major League Baseball.  Uh... 
[00:45:00]  I don't know what he is.  Some kind of priest thing?  What is he, Steve?  It's a priest thing?  Extremely cooperative priest.  Ah, there you go.  What?  Extremely cooperative priest.  I had to, like, practically strip search this guy.  He's got metal somethings all over him because this wand was going off every two seconds.  Oh, yeah?  Ah, well.  It's not like this is Logan Airport or something.  Oh, not at all.  Do you want to bring him in?  Best costume we see between now and six.  We'll get the Yankee tickets. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, look who's on the phone.  There you go.  Robert England.  Hey, I'm back.  Ah!  Freddy.  The street.  Now, what the hell must Halloween be like?  Okay, if I knew you guys were handing out Yankee tickets, you know, I'd have worn a sweater.  Oh, my God.  I'd have been to see you guys.  That would have been an absolute winner.  Freddy.  Now, who's in your waiting room this time, you guys?  The last time I was there, you had that girl that likes the knives. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  You know, we just got back from Boston.  We were doing two days up there, so we pretty much didn't prepare crap for the show.  Robert.  You know, who's out there?  Out there.  I think we have a...  It was a pretty hot waiting room when I was there, isn't it?  Yeah, I know.  Well, we kind of went out of our way when you were here to show you something special.  Robert.  No, I was listening a minute ago.  I mean, you know, it was pretty hot when I was here, and now you're talking about canker  sores.  Robert.  Now that we know each other, the next time you come to New York, you've got to bring  the sweater.  You've got to bring, you know, some form of the gloves. 
[00:46:30]  We could just go raid.  Just find where they left everything from Planet Hollywood.  Yeah, that's all.  They've got all that stuff.  I think it's at Bruce Willis' house in Idaho.  Now, Robert, do you have people come to your house on Halloween and do some trick-or-treating?  Well, you know, I've been on the road for this boogeyman thing, and I'm home this time.  I'm working on lines.  I've just put a pretty stand up in the window, and my wife's out buying candy, so I guess  I'm stuck at home tonight, you know, with the trick-or-treaters and West Wing. 
[00:47:00]  Well, that's what I'm getting at, Opie.  How cool is that?  Would it be to knock on the door as a kid, and goddamn Freddy Krueger's at the door?  Yeah, I've got paper airplane photos of me.  I'm just going to hit him from the balcony.  Not some knockoff, Freddy.  Yeah, not some knockoff, Freddy.  The real guy.  The real deal is there.  Freddy, I tell you.  When we first moved down here, the kids got me real good.  They got paracin and did a giant claw, and I heard it, like this brick path coming up  to my front door.  It took me, like, about a month to get rid of all the wax.  Oh, they screwed you. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, the hardcore paracin claw of death.  Little bastards.  And that's about...  So what are you guys doing tonight?  What are you guys doing?  You're going to stiletto?  We're just going to try to get through this radio show today as well.  And then we're going to go home and watch the World Series like everyone else.  That's what I'm doing.  I can't wait.  I'm actually going to put on a ski mask and dress up like some strange girl's date.  Is that what you're going to do?  Again?  Robert, I was at a little Halloween thing the other day, last Saturday, and we threw in 
[00:48:00]  Boogeyman DVD.  Oh, great.  Yeah, pretty cool.  Great.  Yeah, it's fun.  It's not bad.  It's a good party tape, too.  I like your commentary over it.  You watch it once, and then you watch it again with Robert doing the commentary underneath.  And I noticed, like, during the Nightmare on Elm Street part, you are trying to whip  so many facts out and things that are happening and stuff.  And then some of the other ones, you're like, oh, this scene's great. 
[00:48:30]  You know, we're all learning when we're doing this thing.  We're doing some others.  And I realized that I could do more than one pass.  You guys know what I'm saying.  But, you know, I was trying to get it all out in one.  And then I realized, you know, I didn't have to.  I can do one pass with facts.  And then I can just sort of sit back and tease Jamie Lee Curtis on the other one, you know.  Now, the next time I do one, I'm going to do it better.  It's funny, because you just knew, of course, knew everything about Nightmare on Elm Street.  Yeah, I got all the dirt on that.  And then some of the other ones, you're like, I think I went to.  I don't know a lot about Leprechaun.  Yeah, it's like, I went to school with her, I think. 
[00:49:00]  Get some Westies on the phone.  We'll talk about Leprechaun.  I don't know anything about that.  Look at the pins.  There's a lot of pins on his head.  I wonder how he got those pins on his head.  Maybe he knew.  He knew a lot about Hellraiser.  Yeah, you know about some of the people in Hellraiser and stuff.  Well, no, you know, I worked with that guy.  I worked with Doug Bradley.  He's great.  You know, we were stuck in Spain for like eight weeks doing a low-budget horror movie over in Europe a couple years ago.  And he's fun.  What, the actor Liberace there?  Yeah, Liberace. 
[00:49:30]  I remember him as Liberace.  No, no, no, no, no.  The guy who played Pinhead never played Liberace.  No, the other guy.  Oh, yeah, I know who you saw.  Yeah, he did play Liberace in the made-for-TV movie there.  Right, no, that guy, he wasn't on that shoot.  It was that girl from Spawn, Melinda Clark.  She was from, what was that?  She did that show on last year.  Soldier of Fortune.  It was pretty hot.  Hotest scene in Hellraiser when that chick was banging her husband's brother.  It was just like forbidden sex.  It was also, I think that, you know, they also, they borrow in Hellraiser. 
[00:50:00]  Clive Barker borrowed it, but it's also, you know, those swinging hooks always freak me out.  Yeah, swinging hooks.  Swinging hooks on the chain, whoa.  Yeah, they're pretty good.  That guy that was from one of the Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry movies.  Well, yeah, you know, Andy Robinson.  Yeah, he was the guy that went to reach for the gun.  Yeah.  He goes, go ahead, make my day.  That was the punk.  I mean, I think that was, people thought, you know, in Hollywood, I think that hurt him.  I don't think he worked for years because of that.  You know, he was so psycho in that.  He was like the first really great psycho. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  I didn't recognize him, no.  Yeah.  In Hellraiser.  All cut up.  Robert, you got kids?  No, just dogs.  All right.  Do you dress up for Halloween?  I wonder why.  No, no.  You know, usually I'm on the road doing a gig.  You know, it gets kind of lucrative for me this time of year.  Oh, yeah.  But I've been doing the Boogeyman thing, and I just got back, you know, from San Francisco  and Chicago.  So I'm just taking it easy because I've got to go off and do a movie here next couple of weeks.  So I'm just like, you know, we're R&R at home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got the Hershey's Kisses out in the peanut butter cups. 
[00:51:00]  Just waiting for the brats to come by.  Is it true you were on Charmed last night?  Oh, it was about a couple nights ago, yeah.  Lurking around with the girls there.  But then I was just watching this.  I just saw this movie with Reese Witherspoon and Alyssa Milano playing the bad girl.  Ooh.  Boy, she was hot in this movie.  With Marky Mark.  It's just before Marky Mark hit it big.  Yeah.  I forget the name of it.  Fear or something like that.  Yeah.  He's like the bad girl.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But Alyssa Milano is so hot in that movie.  And they show Marky Mark shirtless. 
[00:51:30]  Right, yeah.  I think that's right.  I think it's in their car.  Yeah.  Oh!  Surprise!  Yeah.  He's doing a promo for Joe Boxers or something.  I'm not getting nothing, but he's just got quite a body on him.  It's, you know.  You like that, Norton?  You like that?  Yeah.  It's at the ab city.  Yeah.  Good abs.  Good pecs, you know.  Is that Norton there?  Who's that?  It's Norton, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  No mistaking what comes out of Norton's at all.  All right there, Robert.  Good.  Good talking to you again.  Yeah, you guys have a good time tonight, okay?  Have a happy Halloween.  Yeah, and I've got my fingers crossed for the Yanks. 
[00:52:00]  They need it bad tonight.  Yep.  Go Diamondbacks, Robert.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  No, no.  Yankees.  Believe me.  Go Diamondbacks.  Yeah, my local bartender's for the Diamondbacks.  I can't even go there until this is over.  Yeah.  No, I'm rooting for the Diamondbacks.  Yeah.  Hey, can you give us a laugh or a scream?  Because it is Halloween, right?  Yeah, you guys, it is Halloween, and, you know, I've got a lot of friends down there  in the parade, so I'm just going to say, sweet dreams, New York. 
[00:52:30]  Nice.  That is great.  That rocks.  Okay.  Have a good time, you guys.  Bye, Mr. England.  Okay, bye-bye.  Come see us when you're in New York.  I will.  I'll bang on the door.  All right.  Right on.  Okay.  Bye.  Bang on the door.  It better not be unannounced.  That would be, like, the scariest thing.  Hey, let's bring the guy in with the costume.  Cool.  This is the priest guy thing.  Come on in.  There you go.  God bless you all.  You got the cross on.  You kind of have that...  Anthony, how about you? 
[00:53:00]  ...that kind of fatherly look to you there.  That'd be a better costume if you had a seven-year-old boy with you.  Yeah, well, I bring a ten-year-old boy usually all the time.  And I hope you and Anthony are really nice to them.  Thanks.  Ah, there you go.  So, uh, did you dress up for work?  Uh, what's your name?  Danny Ramone.  Danny?  You dressed up for work like that?  Danny's, uh...  He's, uh, you got a little headphone action there.  Danny, he's S-faced.  Danny, you all right?  Have you been having any Halloween spirits? 
[00:53:30]  The priest is drunk.  Danny, you drunk?  No.  Your eyes are barely open.  Barely open.  A little taste of the communion wine.  Danny, what do you do?  I drive.  I drive for a living.  Oh, boy.  Hope not today.  No, not today.  Yeah.  Where you been?  Astoria.  I live in Astoria.  Yeah?  Were you at a party or something?  No.  No?  I went to a party this morning with my kid.  Oh, okay. 
[00:54:00]  Where'd you go this morning, Danny?  St. Joseph's Church.  Oh.  And you went dressed like that?  Yes, I did.  To a church?  Well, why not?  Were they a little offended?  No, it was a Halloween party.  Yeah, but you're dressed like a priest.  Those guys have to, you know, make their sacrifices to become a priest.  I made a sacrifice and married my wife.  You what?  Married my wife.  Just like you.  Well, I didn't marry your wife.  No, I didn't.  That was my mistake. 
[00:54:30]  Wow.  Danny, man.  I brought my son here to both you guys one time.  You look familiar.  Yeah, well, maybe.  Open your eyes so I can get a better look at you.  Oh, yeah, thanks.  I think he'd work perfect on our feature film extravaganza.  I got a bone and pig with you.  He'd work great with Bella.  Yeah?  Hey, did they play bobbing for Ultra Boys this morning?  Go ahead, Danny.  What's up, Danny?  Be nice, Danny.  What's up with the Pope being so, uh... 
[00:55:00]  What?  The Pope being so, uh...  So what?  Trying to find those words.  Mean.  The Pope being mean?  No, the Pope's...  The Pope rules.  We've always been friends with the Pope.  Well, let's hear what the Pope has to say about me.  Oh, he's trying to get me to do...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't think I do the Pope voice.  I'm not professional, so...  Oh, yeah.  The setup, right.  I do the Pope thing you were doing the other day.  That was very funny.  Yeah, that cracked me up.  Yeah, that was good.  Yeah, yeah, the Pope thing.  The Pope thing you did the other day was... 
[00:55:30]  Ah, poofah!  That cracked me up.  I know.  The Pope...  No, I'm not going to do all this shit.  The Pope wrote...  Sir.  The Pope wrote...  Sir.  That's awesome.  Well, Danny, you look great.  Yeah, there you go.  And you are so far in the lead for the Yankee ticket.  Because no one else has come by.  I'm a Met fan.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's a drunk priest.  He's a Met fan.  Now it's making sense.  I'm not drunk.  I don't drink.  Ah.  Is that what you tell your wife?  No, I haven't slept. 
[00:56:00]  I haven't been home.  It interferes with the medication.  If you're...  If you sleep over a friend's house, it looks like a jail cell.  Danny, did you recently...  Was there a teacher recently arrested for performing oral treats on you?  No, I'm sorry.  I didn't know that.  This is an arrest...  A teacher arrested for both students.  It was nice.  No, no.  I don't go that way.  No, it was a female.  No, no.  A female.  Not a guy.  Forget it.  Forget it.  All right.  Well, Danny's in the lead.  Yeah, you're in the lead.  Best Halloween costume that comes down here today before 6 o'clock will win the Yankee tickets tonight.  Yes.  And he's a Met fan. 
[00:56:30]  Great.  To beat him out, you're going to have to dress up like a UPS or a FedEx guy.  Yeah.  I hope you feel better.  Well?  But being that you...  I've got to root for the Yankees because we're New York.  And the tragedy that happened, we have to keep it home.  All right.  Wow.  Oh, there's inspiring words.  Thanks.  I just wanted to make you feel better.  But since you predict Diamondbacks and you're cursed, you're in the lead.  All right.  Hey, let's hear it for Danny.  Danny rocks. 
[00:57:00]  That's something.  Danny, everyone.  Danny.  Thank you so much, Danny.  And we will inform you if you win.  Once again, Danny, everyone.  Thank you, Danny.  Danny.  Unwraps the...  The mic cord.  I mean, the headphones that's wrapped around his leg.  Puts that.  All right.  Danny's still in the studio.  Okay.  Danny.  The praise, everyone.  Danny.  Great job, Danny.  And we'll see you...  Yes.  Danny!  Stay...  There he goes, Danny. 
[00:57:30]  And there he goes.  He's leaving.  The drunk priest.  Leading our Halloween costume.  Yankee tickets up for grabs.  Best costume between now and six.  Okay?  Oh, my God.  Kid touch.  Wow.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up?  My two favorite crackers.  What's up, man?  What's going on, y'all?  All right.  Yo, you my muncher.  What's up?  Yo, always...  This is a message to all you ladies.  Naked, always a good costume. 
[00:58:00]  Naked, always a good costume?  Always a good costume.  Naked girl.  Yes.  I would talk to the guy.  Of course, Anthony, we wouldn't know...  I heard your little comment on the way in.  What?  It was that my throat was sore from smoking.  So that would say, your throat is sore from sucking on fags?  Ooh.  A bag being the English word for cigarette.  Wow.  And they say black people don't pay attention.  Love and happiness. 
[00:58:30]  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Bye.  Okay.  Go get a job.  What did I say?  I don't know what the first part of the er was.  Okay.  Stupid nip.  What?  You need sleep.  God, do you need sleep.  Yo.  No one said anything. 
[00:59:00]  You need sleep.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Regroup.  He called us crackers.  He's supposed to do.  That doesn't offend me.  I know.  I like being called cracker.  I don't care.  My two favorite crackers.  I was going to read Starker.  Well, you want to read Starker Patty's letter real fast?  Yeah, let me see that.  Before we take a break.  Let me see it.  The priest guy is looking in the door.  What's up, Danny?  You all right?  Danny's cool?  What?  He's opening the door. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, no.  Is it locked?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Being like I said I don't drink, my wife's going to kill me when I get home.  Oh, really?  No, Danny, it was just for the radio.  It's obvious from your parents that you don't drink, so if your wife's listening, that, yeah,  it was just for the radio.  Right.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  Good night.  You left your liver on the console.  By the way, I know you're going to read this, Ant.  There was just one thing I wanted to give you to.  It ties in.  There was a guy who was recently charged with raping a 68-year-old virgin during a home invasion. 
[01:00:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I just read that.  68 years she holds on to it.  Yeah.  And some slob.  Yeah.  Wow.  Brutal.  Good for him.  Speaking of virgin, Patty did indeed write us a little letter.  What's going on out there?  Hey, Danny, staggering down the hall.  Danny, everyone.  Is he all right?  No.  Really?  I was about to ask if you guys wanted him removed, but...  No, he's fine.  Okay. 
[01:00:30]  All right.  Can we play a Patty Noonan song and shove him into an elevator shaft?  Oh, God.  Please.  All right.  Go ahead, Ant.  Start from Patty's letter.  Oh, my God.  This is awful.  That's why...  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Welcome back from Boston.  It seems I got quite an education from the Yo and I show.  And here are the following What Did I Learns, which I tried to cool in yesterday.  What?  I guess no one was picking up Patty's calls. 
[01:01:00]  Ooh.  She was on hold for over an hour while we were in Boston.  She was calling from a pay phone.  So she wrote What Did I Learns?  Well, what's wrong?  I guess Patty's upstairs in her costume.  Oh, my God.  She can't win the Yankee tickets.  We just gave her U2 tickets.  I know.  You guys, you're going to embarrass the hell out of us if this contest doesn't turn out  well between now and six.  Best Halloween costume gets Yankee tickets.  Yeah.  Come on.  It's a little serious for shots.  What is she dressed as? 
[01:01:30]  A retard in a bad wig.  Cancer-ridden super lady.  Oh, is she in her super lady outfit?  She's in her super lady suit.  Oh, my God.  From...  All right.  Bring her down.  Read the letters.  They bring Patty down.  Don't worry.  We'll make this Patty segment really quick.  What did I learn, which I tried to cool in yesterday.  I learned Opie was on fire over a Dr. Pepper commercial.  What?  What?  Stinks.  What the...  What the f*** does that even mean?  I was backstage drinking with Crystal Method, and we were doing Dr. Pepper shots. 
[01:02:00]  Shots.  And they were lit.  And my finger, a couple fingers were on fire.  On fire.  It wasn't a commercial.  It's just...  Go ahead.  I learned Opie almost got busted at the bar.  Oh, that's from the guy.  I can help.  The pot?  Yeah, the guy that handed me loose pot in Boston.  Are these all just Opie?  What you learned about Opie?  It seems to be going down that road.  Yeah, right? 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  Here's a...  I learned the secret room is located in Ocean Township behind Rascals.  That's a good one.  You like that one, right, Norton?  All right.  I learned Anthony dropped a couple of his T-cells in Boston.  What does that mean?  Almost funny, because you went to the queer circus.  Oh, okay.  She was almost on to something there.  And we did that you dropped something, sir.  So she tied it in.  Right, right.  Wow, she's so...  I learned Anthony and Jim went to a queer circus. 
[01:03:00]  Tell me, were there performing bears and stuff?  Ha, ha.  Well, you find bears at circuses.  She wrote, ha.  Just the fact that she wrote, tell me, and you know a witty comment?  Yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  You also learned that when Opie says he'll go to the phones next before a commercial break  at 545, it might mean that I'm still holding at 640.  And so is everyone else. 
[01:03:30]  He never went to the phones.  Anyway, I hope you enjoyed my What Did I Learns?  Have a nice day, party.  P.S.  My hair is growing back fast.  I might be able to toss the wig as early as Thanksgiving.  Hopefully.  I don't think looking like a female buzzard becomes me.  Eh, that's pretty funny.  Female buzzard.  I'll give her that.  Bring her in really, really fast.  She's changing into her costume. 
[01:04:00]  What?  She's not in it yet.  All right.  Well, then let's take this break.  This much-needed break.  God.  She, we gave her that costume, I guess, huh?  She didn't have to return it?  Whatever.  Hey, this is Billy Idol, and I'm wild, and I'm crazy, and I'm listening to Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  We are Sports Guys, Blaine and Craig.  Morning, John and Mike.  Midday.  Opie and Anthony.  Afternoon.  Ron and Fez at night.  We are 1027 WNEW. 
[01:04:30]  Anthony O2Go.  Hey, how about that?  O2Go.  We're talking about water, yeah.  It's oxygenated, distilled drinking water.  It's pure, great taste, no aftertaste, and it's got more oxygen in it to give your brain  a little bit of a boost.  It's like a perk me up.  Maybe the O2Go people should send more so we can drink it and really enjoy it so when  we talk about it, we'll know what we're talking about.  Great idea.  O2Go people, please send some more. 
[01:05:00]  We like it.  Because I'm drinking Poland Springs right now, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  You need more oxygen.  O2Go.  Send us some of the original blue bottle.  It's calorie-free, essence flavor.  Or the black sports bottle with even more oxygen in it.  That's what we need.  I like the black bottle.  It's like a coffee replacement.  Perk me up without the caffeine.  It's O2Go.  Oxygenated, distilled drinking water.  Tastes great.  Like I said, no aftertaste.  And it gives you a little brain oxygenation. 
[01:05:30]  There you go.  O2Go.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony show.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Give us a call anywhere else, including Washington, D.C.  Yes, D.C.  866-2774.  Wow, D-Dog is on the line.  What's up, D-Dog?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  How are you?  All right, Norton, you rule?  Yes. 
[01:06:00]  Whatever he is right now.  You guys were getting ready to explain to me and your other 29 loyal, devoted listeners  down here in D.C. that basically you got buck wild in Philly and Boston, and now you're  not coming down here because...  We didn't say we're not coming down to Washington, D.C.  There is something...  I'm just busting your balls.  There are words going around between management that perhaps...  Does the word responsibility come into play? 
[01:06:30]  Man, professionalism, responsibility, professionalism, alcoholism, other isms.  Well, what do you need any of that stuff for?  Onto Us has come off.  It's just...  We tend to really have a good time when we take this show on the road.  Right, we heard.  I think the problem with taking the show on the road is that we shouldn't take the show  on the road on a Monday or a Tuesday. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, that really blows.  We should take the show on the road for like a Thursday and a Friday.  Thursday, Friday, crash out for the weekend.  And then we're nice and fresh and ready to go on Monday.  This feels like Monday right now because I feel like I have been through a huge party weekend.  Right.  But it's Monday and Tuesday that we did it.  Well, here's the deal.  We're supposed to leave for Washington Saturday.  Yeah.  Saturday night, get into Washington, D.C., hang out with the station a little bit.  Sunday, go to a Redskins game, maybe do a little tailgating. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  Find a bar, hang out with our very small O&A Army from the Washington, D.C. area.  Sure.  And then Monday, broadcast from WJFK, have listeners show up outside the station and have a lot of fun.  Right.  Well, we got back from Boston, the bosses, they took one look at us and they said, guys, we have to talk.  I'm going to hang up on D-Dog because your phone is distracting us. 
[01:08:00]  We have to talk.  Yeah.  We think that it might not be a good idea to go to Washington, D.C. on Saturday.  Yeah.  We think it would be a good idea that you guys recuperate.  Rest.  And rest.  Over the weekend.  Over the weekend.  You look a little road weary.  Did they ask us for urine tests?  And how high is your blood alcohol level? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Anyway.  Yeah, so they're a little, just a little leery about sending us back out on the road.  After coming back from Boston today, pretty much all of us effed up.  We love hitting the road.  It's a lot of fun.  We had a great time in Boston and when we said goodbye to the staff around 7.30 last night, it was kind of sad.  Yeah.  A lot of hugs going around and stuff.  Well, sure.  We didn't get that many hugs when we went to Philly.  No.  Tim Sabian didn't hug me.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm. 
[01:09:00]  Why didn't Tim Sabian with his slacks hug us?  I don't know.  We're leaving Philly.  It was kind of sad when we pulled out of Boston.  In other words, unsupervised was another word that came up.  Sure.  Chaperone.  Chaperone.  Need to hire chaperones.  Might be.  Possibly.  Someone to look after us.  Could you imagine somebody coming out on the road to try to look after us?  Could you imagine that?  Blonde with a water drinking habit and a weak bladder.  And they also said, and this kind of pissed me off, they said that we don't think that 
[01:09:30]  you have a big enough following in the Washington, D.C. area yet, and maybe we should wait until  you guys catch on a little bit more.  A few more people listening in that D.C.  So when you go down there, it could be a really big deal instead of maybe just hanging out at  Friday's and having a few beers and a few potato skins.  Right.  A few.  Just a few now.  Don't have too many.  So I guess we're going to sit down and talk about tomorrow and try to figure out what we can do. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  I was looking forward to hitting the road again myself.  Yeah.  We were going to do the show Monday in Washington, and then on the way home Tuesday, we were going to hit Philly.  Yeah.  And see where that led.  And then get back here next Wednesday.  Oh, my God.  I know.  It really is.  It really is something when we hit the road.  It's just nonstop is why. 
[01:10:30]  And we can't say no to anyone, so we bring everybody.  Everyone comes with us.  And then we hold the station.  We're going to a hostage, and we tell them that we need 10 hotel rooms.  And lots of beer.  And if you could sneak a little weed in there.  You know, it's just getting out of hand.  Yeah.  We brought Earl to Boston.  We love Earl.  We love when he hangs out with us.  Nothing.  Earl did absolutely nothing in Boston for two days.  Nothing.  Useless.  And they had to pay Earl's bill, just like everyone else's.  Hotel rooms and stuff. 
[01:11:00]  Dinners.  We're like a rap act with an entourage.  We are.  That will just milk the record company's resources.  That's pretty much it.  So we go around with everybody, and we drink, and we get all daffed up.  So now they're having second thoughts.  They're having second thoughts.  And rap acts have chicks going with them, by the way.  Brief little asterisk there by the rap analogy.  So we're going to sit down and talk. 
[01:11:30]  We'll see what we hammer out.  We would love to go to Washington, D.C.  Yeah.  I don't care if there's 20 people listening to us that want to hang with us.  That would be cool, too, you know?  It would be a humbling experience for this crew.  Certainly would.  Any more costumes showing up?  You know, this Halloween really blows.  There is no, it's, it's, since September 11th, everyone petrified.  They're scared for their children.  Everyone's scared for the children. 
[01:12:00]  And even years ago, everyone was afraid because you just get kooks around the house.  Remember when it was just simple pedophiles in your neighborhood?  Now we're worried about international terrorists.  A stupid razor blade, maybe an apple.  Right.  It's always like some kind of urban legend thing that went on.  But now people are genuinely scared.  And here's an idea I read from Ann Landers.  Oh, it'll be Ann Landers.  Ann Landers came up with a great Halloween idea.  Listen to this crap.  Go to, she calls it, trick or trunk or treat. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  What this is.  The little children all get dressed up.  Right?  Trick or trunk.  Trick or trunk.  They all get dressed up.  And you drive your kids and a trunk full of candy that you bought to the local church parking lot.  Then you park the cars in like a big circle with the trunks all facing each other.  And the little kids get let loose. 
[01:13:00]  And they make their way from one trunk to another.  As the parents of their children stand there by their trunk handing out the candy to the kids that come by the various car trunks.  That sucks.  That sucks.  And after the last one, they're raped by any trunk.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  It's a safe event.  It's so safe.  You know, I think it's time to wipe Halloween off the calendar.  You know, for a few years running now, it's just been pretty much nothing. 
[01:13:30]  It's getting stupider and stupider.  When we were growing up.  Out of fear.  You put a costume on and you're let loose in the neighborhoods.  When I was a kid, that's what you did.  You know what?  You drive around neighborhoods tonight, you don't see as many kids.  You absolutely don't.  They do the safe trick-or-treating and malls and stuff.  Years ago, it was your parent or parents would take you out when you were a real little kid and walk you around until dusk.  And then you'd go home.  But the kids that were about, you know, 10, 11, 12, they were able to go out by themselves even after it got a little dark. 
[01:14:00]  Now, you don't see that anymore.  Everyone's petrified.  And this only made it worse.  Like I said, a few people like Norton ruined it for everybody years ago.  But now everyone's afraid of the anthrax being in their candy.  And I didn't ruin anything.  If someone shows up and I happen to be wearing a certain outfit, well.  What are you going to say?  Come on in.  And the egging and tee-peeing, that good-natured fun from Halloween past. 
[01:14:30]  You know what that gets you now?  Lawn jobs, blowing up mailboxes.  Yeah.  Of the kid you hated in high school.  Could get you shot now.  This is what happens.  You got to be careful.  In the bag of crap on fire.  That was...  We were watching SNL earlier.  The one where...  It was the Halloween episode.  And the kids were throwing eggs.  So they had, what's his name, Foley there. 
[01:15:00]  Come in, Farley came in and did his little bit.  It's the funniest goddamn thing.  That son of a bitch had to go kill himself.  How does it feel to be an egg?  Hey, can we get Patty in here and get her out of here?  Yeah, where's Patty in her costume?  Bob, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm calling from Philly.  Right on, man.  You guys were talking earlier about radio stations running ads against you guys?  Yeah, a lot of stations are trying to do that and trying to get to us.  Yes.  That Y100 here in Philly? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  They do a whole thing about Philly.  Yeah.  This whole spiel they have going on down here.  Trying to get some listeners.  Wait, so what?  They say why would Philly people want to listen to New York guys?  Yeah, they do a whole thing like the Phillies.  You don't like the Mets or the Yankees.  Eagles don't like the Giants.  I think that's what makes it fun.  What?  Dude, let me tell you something.  That is a stupid way to go against us as well for a couple reasons. 
[01:16:00]  One being, most radio guys are not from the city they broadcast from.  That is a fact.  Second, one of the morning guys at Y100 commutes from, you guessed it, New York City.  Oh, see.  Comes back to New York every weekend.  Well, it's that, you know, let's be local Joes.  Yeah, yeah.  Very important.  Schmucks.  It's pretty important to have that local angle. 
[01:16:30]  Well, I'm sure that's working well for them, Bob.  Yeah, they suck.  All right, thank you.  All right, you guys suck.  Well, look it up for yourself.  One of the guys that commutes from New York.  Oh, my gosh, look at her.  Can you read my mind?  I'm at the Fortress of Yellow Solitude. 
[01:17:00]  There she is.  She was deposited here many years ago on an asteroid.  Super Patty.  Super lady.  Patty's super lady.  She's got her ridiculous Superman outfit on.  And that wig.  Oh, my God.  Patty, that wig is looking really bad.  Patty, take the wig off.  Let me see.  It's growing back.  Wow.  You know something, though?  And fast.  You go fast.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  That's barely.  It's like Fred Flintstone mouth.  No, it's getting dark already.  Good.  I hope it comes in dark and curly.  You're hoping it comes in dark and curly?  Yeah.  What's your hair normally?  Dark and curly?  And it's going to come in dark and curly, you retard.  Patty, you know what you should do?  Take the wig off.  Get a wheelchair and go as Christopher Reeve.  You'll look like him.  I'm thinking of shaving my head, and I'm going to hope it comes back black and curly.  Who knows?  It just might happen.  Come back blonde and straight.  How does your wig have dandruff?  I'm sick of the blonde hair.  I don't have dandruff on here. 
[01:18:00]  You could do that, though.  The Christopher Reeve thing?  Just take the wig off.  Take the wig off.  Leave it off.  Yeah.  That's Christopher Reeve these days.  Now, open your eyes real wide and don't move your...  Go ahead.  Open your eyes real wide and don't move.  Don't move your neck.  You freak.  I look like an emu.  A what?  An emu.  An emu?  Yeah.  They're bald birds.  Look at her.  You are ridiculous. 
[01:18:30]  You look like a 15-year-old boy.  You do.  Nice.  When I was a little kid and I had my hair short, I was mistaken for a boy a couple times.  Oh, yeah.  By the local pastor.  Earl's on the floor laughing so hard down the hall.  You look like a soccer hooligan.  Thanks.  You do look like a hooligan.  So, where are you going dressed up like that?  To a Halloween party at a co-worker's party from Godiva.  Co-worker's party.  Anyone at Godiva notice that you don't have hair anymore?  Yeah, the district manager heard the whole thing and was laughing over it. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Prattie, are you wearing eye makeup?  Well, yeah.  Why?  I always do.  Why?  I always do.  But I see a little more eye shadow on your eyes.  You're trying to look pretty.  And you're super lady kiss, Doom.  Is there a fella there you're looking forward to seeing?  Yeah, what kind of party is this?  Hey, Tank Girl, what's on your ears?  Nothing.  What is that?  What's wrong with her ears? 
[01:19:30]  It looks kind of scary on one ear here.  What's going on?  Patty, comment.  Patty, we gave you a lot of money to shave your head.  A lot of people don't know that.  I know.  So, why don't you take some of that money and get a better wig?  We gave you this one just to get you started.  It's a starter.  Well, I like the color of black.  It's plastic.  It doesn't look like hair.  That wig costs us five bucks.  I know.  It's like a Halloween costume wig.  Well, this is the one day you can get away with it.  Halloween. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  People are probably wondering, why is she wearing a ridiculous wig with a Superman costume?  Not knowing that she wears a ridiculous wig every day.  You look really silly.  That's good.  Now, who's going to be at this party?  Friends of yours?  Listen, you're going to hook up.  You're going to lose that virginity?  No.  Co-workers.  F me.  People I work with.  I'm drunk.  F me.  F me.  Silly.  It's going to be about 20 people there.  20 people.  And everybody's going dressed up or in orange and black.  Yeah.  They're going to be 20 people. 
[01:20:30]  Aquaman.  Spirative man.  Billy Staples in the studio.  Billy?  Billy.  Oh, it's a big Afro wig.  I don't think I would be.  Put the Afro wig on, Patty.  Put the Afro wig on.  Let's see what it looks like.  Let's see if it looks better.  Super Patty, Afro Patty lady.  Three wigs.  I won't even need one.  Oh, sure.  It's grown back so fast.  Honey.  You have nubs that are barely even visible on your head.  It's looking darker, but you're still completely bald.  You know something?  That looks better than the other wig that you have.  Oh, my God.  You look like Phyllis Diller with black hair.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[01:21:00]  Give it to my eyes.  Can I see what I look like?  It's a picture of a horse's ass.  You look like Little Orphan Annie with black hair.  Patty, that is ridiculous.  Thank you.  I know.  Know what you look like?  Don't tell him that.  But he'll look much longer, though.  Right.  I don't think he's gotten the haircut in five years.  Big, big nose of yours.  In five years.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  That's good, Patty.  Sure.  It'll grow in, and it's going to look nice.  Oh, it's going to look beautiful when it grows in.  Sure.  Of course it will.  Sure.  Your lips are looking a little fuller.  Yeah.  What are you wearing on your lips?  Nothing.  Ah.  Ah.  No, huh?  All right, Patty.  Thank you.  Patty, enjoy your Halloween party.  I sure will.  With your 20 people.  Are they close friends or just acquaintances? 
[01:22:00]  Coworkers.  People I work at the chocolate store with.  And they should give you a raise with all the free plugs they're getting for Godiva.  Godiva.  Make sure they give you a raise, all right?  Well, next year I'll get one.  Meanwhile, at the party.  Hi, how are you?  Boring lady is boring people to death.  What will Superman do?  Boring lady, boring people to death.  Hi, so I work at the table, but I also work at McDonald's. 
[01:22:30]  No!  No!  Well, I don't say no at McDonald's.  Aquaman is trying to drown himself.  I got kind of a rod looking at you.  Wow, look at this.  Meanwhile, at this doll party.  Hi, how are you?  Look, I'm super lady.  My hair should be fine by tomorrow.  I'm going as super delusional lady.  My hair's fine.  I lead a normal life. 
[01:23:00]  Being a virgin at 45 is terrific.  My wig looks great.  Hi, I'm super delusional lady.  Hey, my co-workers are enjoying me here.  That's a gross end.  I have a normal life.  It really drives me what to do with it.  You know, it's a gross end.  Men like me, I choose not to have sex.  Oh, God.  Patty, thank you.  There you go.  Well, you're welcome.  Yeah.  Thanks.  You got to get a picture of the way the feet cover the shoes.  What?  There's feet?  Oh, there's feet on that suit. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, you didn't notice this.  It's just supposed to cover the shoes, but it's a kid's costume, so they're not tall enough.  Right.  Just to cover it.  It'll make it look like a boot.  All right.  Patty, hey.  Great appearance.  Thank you.  Great.  Awful, honest shoes.  I'll put the other wig on.  All right, Patty, everyone.  Thank you.  Stalker Patty.  There you go.  Stalker Patty.  Francie, what's up?  Hello.  How are you?  You sound like Patty.  You sound like Patty.  Oh, my God.  I'm a listener from D.C., and I started listening right around the time the attacks occurred, 
[01:24:00]  and I seem to hear from a lot of people that call you from D.C. that they started listening  right around that time.  Yeah.  Well, that would make sense, because that's about the time we started in Washington, D.C.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  So there's something to that, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was just thinking that maybe, you know, you guys really do need to come down here so  more people can, you know, get exposed to you and stuff like that.  Well, that would be a good idea, but management doesn't really think that there's a...  There's a big enough following yet down in D.C.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what they're hinting at.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  So we'll figure it out tomorrow, and hopefully we'll have an answer, all right?  That's cool.  I just wanted to call and let you know that there are some people listening to you down  here.  Okay, Francie.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks, Francie.  Bye-bye.  Hey, Patty, you left this.  How's our Halloween costume party going?  We've had one drunk priest guy, and Patty doesn't want people to know that he was drunk,  Anthony, because his wife is a huge fan of this show, and if he comes home drunk, she's  going to get really pissed because she told him not to drink anymore.  Well, that's just a bit when I say drunk guy. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  What I mean is drunk guy.  Yeah.  For radio purposes, he's drunk priest guy.  Right.  And they dumped out of who, who, who?  Oh, boy.  Well, that's something else we're going to have to deal with, I guess, down the road.  We're going to have to deal with that a little bit down the road with the manager Mente.  Please.  Read the contract.  That's right.  Read the contract.  I'll make you wipe with it first and then shove it in your face.  Smell it. 
[01:25:30]  Read the contract.  A little breach there.  A little breach.  A little breach of contract.  The hell are they doing?  That was a hilarious line.  Of course.  Hilarious.  I only come up with two a day and one's gone already.  Oh, well.  And they dump out.  Maybe the next one I come up with will be just as witty and fun.  For what?  Why?  Why are they dumping that?  Oh, boy.  I haven't talked.  Oh, boy.  I thought it was a temporary two-day moratorium on a certain subject because someone's tears had to dry. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's all.  That's all.  I thought we were doing someone a favor.  We were doing a favor and now it's being taken advantage of.  We sat and said, all right, a couple of days, that's fine.  That's fine.  Let the wound heal.  Let people take the Kleenex, dab their eyes out, you know, if they're a little too emotional. 
[01:26:30]  Let them suckle a little while.  Suckle a little bit on management's teat.  And then after a couple of days, we go back to business as usual.  Get them distracted by handing them a rattle.  That's it.  But, no, for some reason now, it's gone on now for a couple of weeks.  Yeah, it's smart to dump out of the funny lines from our radio show.  Sure.  Of course.  Of course.  That are well within FCC guidelines and the guidelines of our recently signed contract. 
[01:27:00]  Which we agreed to.  Right.  And which they agreed to and signed and looked at.  But now there's a problem again.  Now there's a problem again.  Things being dumped out of.  Unbelievable.  Try your eyes.  And let's get back to business as usual.  All right, Ed.  Let's take a break.  Ah, right.  Maybe more costumes will come in.  I can't wait.  Actually, a few more downstairs.  Oh, yeah, are they?  Oh, a few costumes downstairs, Anthony. 
[01:27:30]  There's one guy dressed up as Jimmy J.J. Walker because he's the security guy.  He's not in costume.  Halloween costume party on the ONA show today.  Best costume wins tickets to the Yankee game tonight at the stadium.  Talked to me the other day.  Courtesy of Budweiser.  Budweiser, the king of beers.  You only have until 6 o'clock to get down here, and we'll vote for the best costume.  Jimmy Walker talked to you?  Dynamite.  Yeah, Jimmy Walker.  I guarantee he got his hair cut after hearing us talk about him being Jimmy Walker.  The security guy downstairs is one of them.  I swear to God, he has this spitting image.  And when he talks, dude, he sounds and looks like him even as he talks. 
[01:28:00]  I was coming in with some kind of program from CompUSA, and he goes, oh, that's available right now?  I was like, yeah, yeah, dynamite, Jimmy.  I think he did get his hair cut because he had like the big Jimmy J.J. Walker 70s afro for a while.  That's really coming back these days.  And then he had the shaved head look.  James!  J.J. has the worst security at 888-711. 
[01:28:30]  Mama, why J.J. got in the crackers?  They're all God's people.  They might dump out if you make fun of Jimmy Walker.  Yeah, it's Jimmy complaining.  He's got a radio show.  Drop a dime.  Let me hear what's on your mind.  Yes.  Yes.  All right, well, we got a little taste of Frank Caliendo before we take a break.  All right.  Before we take a break. 
[01:29:00]  Remember that time you did that thing where you did the...  That was awesome, man.  Okie dokie.  So, what are we doing here?  I have no idea where these calls are going.  Okie dokie.  Man, did I just pop the microphone with my lips?  That was an incorrect decision.  I don't have any feeling in my skin.  I can't remember names.  I'm having trouble feeling my feet.  Oh, my God. 
[01:29:30]  I'm sorry.  They just happen sometimes.  Wow.  Opie and Anthony.  We're a bunch of perverted crackers.  You ready?  Oh, what?  It's hard to listen to us trying to talk teen girls into doing stuff with each other?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Guy showed up with a costume.  Yeah, I saw that.  Less than an hour left in this horrible contest. 
[01:30:00]  Awful.  Best Halloween costume today.  Gets tickets to the World Series for tonight's game at the stadium.  Courtesy of Budweiser.  Budweiser, the king of beers in Major League Baseball.  We were hoping women would show up, but no dice, Anthony.  Right now.  By the way, you've got to start voting for your favorite boobo lantern.  The qualifying is done.  Now you've got to vote between now and the end of the show Friday. 
[01:30:30]  You're going to give $1,000 to first place.  So go to opiananthony.com and vote for your fave.  What's going on, Kit?  Hey, Owen, what are you doing?  Talking to you, man.  Hey, man, I just want to let you know I'm over here in D.C.  I'm stuck in traffic.  Everybody's going home to trick-or-treat.  I have a homemade wow sticker in my backseat, and I just got wowed.  You got wowed in D.C.?  Yeah, so I figure you guys must have a bit of a following over here. 
[01:31:00]  We know we have some people listening to us down there.  We've got to figure out what we're going to do with this road trip.  Yeah, well, we're hoping you come down, man.  All right, thank you, Kit.  All right, man.  All right, cool.  Later.  Yeah, it is Whippin' Mountain Wednesday.  We really haven't talked about that yet today, but you know the deal.  You put wow on the back of your ride, whether it's a homemade wow sign or a wow bumper sticker,  and if the ladies feel like it, they will flash you on the way home from work.  Yes.  Yes.  Do it all the time in New York.  There's a little treat for Halloween. 
[01:31:30]  That's a very nice treat.  A little treat.  You want to show your wow?  A trick-or-treat?  Unless you accidentally pick up a tranny, and it's a trick.  That's a trick, yes.  How many times did that happen, Norton?  One that I've discussed.  Yes.  With that big, your hand running over his big back.  Large black back.  Smooth skin, though, if I remember correctly.  Thank God for that.  Speaking of large backs, you've got to see what's going to walk in here.  Yeah, what is this?  Well, you know, I think the guy, quickly, he's a smart guy.  He realized this contest blows, and I think he went to the local convenience store and found a couple things 
[01:32:00]  and threw it on and said, here's my costume.  What is it, though?  Well, let's get him in here.  In the meantime, it's Elfman.  Elfman, what's up?  Yeah, I wanted to let you guys know a little funny story.  The company I work for is really a safety conscience, and the supervisor down there says,  yeah, I bought a bunch of candy for my kids, and after I take my kids out trick-or-treating,  I'm throwing all their candy out and giving them the stuff I bought. 
[01:32:30]  I was thinking to myself, what an effing tool.  Well, that's what it's all about now.  You know, I was wondering if you guys think of something.  I don't know.  Elfman, you're right.  That was a very funny story.  Yes.  I enjoyed it.  What about the Star Jones collection?  Shut up!  Shut up!  Star Jones has their own...  Shut up!  Shut up!  What?  Shut up!  Hey, uh...  What?  Yeah, Star Jones got a... 
[01:33:00]  Shut up!  What?  And...  Shut up!  What about Norton's...  Norton's a little...  Shut up!  What?  All right, you guys do that.  Shut up!  Later.  Shut up!  By the way, I should add, if you still don't have a wild bumper sticker in the New York  area especially, just send a self-addressed stamped envelope and we'll send some...  Shut up!  Yeah.  You dick.  All right, who's this?  Who's the clown in the way?  This is Jana.  Well, you wanted a woman. 
[01:33:30]  You got a woman.  Jana.  Jana.  What are you?  I am the famous German cyclist, Jana Ulrich.  Oh, oh, that Jana.  I didn't know that.  That's actually nicer than Patty's wig.  Yeah, it is, actually.  How fat for a topper.  I don't have the hair anyway, either.  Oh, yeah, you got the shaved head.  I got the shaved head.  Who the hell would know what you're dressed as?  That's not...  A couple people in New York knew.  Oh, really?  I was walking over here.  Jana.  But the real cyclist is a guy.  That's the problem. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, the real cyclist is a guy.  But he's a German guy.  I am not getting it.  Does he have stupid hair like you?  Uh, no.  That platinum wig that you're wearing there.  Hey, I just had to throw on what I had at home.  Let me guess.  You're headed down to the village for the Halloween party.  Well, maybe I might be headed to Yankee Stadium.  Well, one or the other.  I'll wear this there if I get the tickets.  Yeah, you could do that.  Wait a minute.  All right, Jana.  Well, there you go.  Well, your costume blows, bro. 
[01:34:30]  I mean, I know we're pathetic, but...  That's the costume.  Hey, hey.  What, um...  It's a cute pathetic.  And Ken Stevens wants his shorts back.  I got more whistles on the street.  No, I'm like Tim Sabian.  Oh, no, you wrecked it.  God, am I dumb.  You gotta know your bosses.  I got more whistles on the street than any girl I ever walk with.  Oh, really?  The streets of...  Yes, Greenwich Village.  Oh, here.  Really?  From Midtown.  Really?  And guys are whistling.  Yeah.  How far is the honking horns?  Yeah, no.  Do you like, uh...  Do you like the men? 
[01:35:00]  Well, sure, Opie.  Who doesn't?  Do you like the men?  Why do you do this?  Do you like men?  Do I like men?  Oh, I love men.  Of course he does.  I mean, no.  He's dressed.  Like.  I'm a liberated girl.  There you go.  He's a liberated girl.  You like men, right?  Don't be asked a rat if it likes cheese.  All right?  So, would you enjoy these Yankee tickets?  Yes.  Yeah, you're a Yankee fan?  I am the Yankee fan.  Who's your favorite Yankee?  Who is my favorite? 
[01:35:30]  Derek Jeter.  Oh, Derek Jeter.  There you go.  How's that for a topper?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Shut up!  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Okay.  They're all pink on the inside.  I got them.  Well.  Well, um.  That's disgusting.  What a great costume.  You're in the lead.  There's nobody else.  Shut up.  If we give you Yankee tickets, they're not going to go to waste, right? 
[01:36:00]  They will not go to waste.  I promise you.  No.  No.  All right.  Wow.  Well, thank you.  What?  Steve C.  Squeezing.  Cops a little feel.  What are they?  Yeah.  They're fake boobs.  What are they?  They are Nerf footballs.  Football.  Have you used any duct tape with this costume?  No.  The cycling shorts are tight enough for that, unfortunately.  They're not made for walking around.  Oh, really?  It's kind of a hurting to walk around.  It's like they're good when you sit on the bike, but not when you're walking around. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  He has camel toe.  How's that for a chopper?  All right.  Well, you are indeed, I guess, in the lead.  Does he beat drunk priest guy?  I don't know.  Huh?  It's sort of the same level of I don't care about either of their costumes.  And you just threw that wig on.  This guy was out biking.  He threw two Nerf footballs on his chest, and he got a wig from 7-Eleven or something. 
[01:37:00]  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Want me to do a loop?  No.  I want to talk, too.  Oh, my God.  Someone else better come up here with a costume.  What's that?  In the next 45 minutes, please.  Huh?  We have another one.  Oh, we do?  Uh-huh.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Puzzah!  Jeez, I don't want to get the AIDS, fellas.  Ah, well.  And who are you? 
[01:37:30]  My name's Adam, but my costume's name is Zeke.  I'm a mullet rocker.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's Zeke.  Is it too late to go back to Boston?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  You're a mullet rocker, and I see you've got the aviator sunglasses on, the favorite of  the mullet rocker.  And you have a mullet wig on?  Yeah, a mullet wig, sunglasses, which picked up at a gas station.  A Metallica shirt on?  Does the hair come off? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, the hair comes off.  Let's see the hair.  Oh, people think it's my real hair.  No, that's pretty bad.  I can take it off.  All right, so you're a regular guy.  So your real name is?  Adam.  Adam.  But he's Zeke.  But Zeke.  I'm usually a pretty clean cop, but I didn't shave for like two and a half weeks to get the  right scruff.  A true mullet rocker.  This could be the worst costume ever.  I got a big belt buckle, too.  Yeah, I see that.  The big skull belt buckle.  When did you decide to do this?  Was it 3.05 today? 
[01:38:30]  No, this was maybe a week or so.  Oh, really?  Yeah, the muse just hit me, so I went with it.  Yeah.  That's great.  And you rock out to mullet rock.  Mullet rock, like Billy Skinner, though.  This is so pathetic.  I'm enjoying it.  You look like every guy in Pittsburgh.  Maybe.  I'm kind of...  I'm in New York, though.  I'm kind of liking it.  It's pretty...  At least he has some humor to it.  I was at the bar on time.  I didn't like doing some, you know, dancing. 
[01:39:00]  There's an air guitar and stuff.  Some air guitar.  All right, it's going to be a tough choice between the drunken priest, Yano, the gay  bicyclist, and mullet head rocker.  He's like every guy upstate, too.  So, upstate New York, a lot of these guys.  Or out past Riverhead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Out on Long Island.  East in Long Island.  I figured maybe this is the true American look.  Is that it?  Maybe, yeah.  All right.  I kind of like that he brought a little humor to it, Opie. 
[01:39:30]  Sure.  Well, stick around.  I mean, the contest is over in 40 minutes.  I don't think anyone can beat you.  Who knows what could happen?  Well, do we keep a running leader through this whole thing?  Yano, do you think he's cute?  Not my type.  Not your type?  What is your type?  What's your type, by the way?  A little more clean cut.  A little more clean cut.  But he's clean cut without the wig.  Yeah, take off your wig.  This is the costume of the dead.  See?  Yeah, but I don't know if I want this guy liking my look too much. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, you like them clean cut.  Let's wait 40 more minutes and see what comes in.  He's got a nice rack.  Ho, ho.  Ho, ho.  Hey, what about Rick?  Yano.  Is Rick your type?  No.  No.  No?  Why, he's well built.  He's uncut and strapping.  He's a peeler.  How do you know that?  Nice smile.  It's a mystery every time it's unwrapped.  Oh, my God.  All right, guys.  What cracker spread will it smell like today? 
[01:40:30]  All right.  Sure.  Well, wait around outside.  Let's see if anyone comes in and beats you guys.  I don't know.  We'll tabulate some scores in the meantime.  Wait for new people to come in.  Between you two, I don't know who I'm going to vote for.  Are you a big Yankee fan?  Yeah, a big Yankee fan.  Yeah.  I heard this guy noise.  He's his favorite Yankee.  He's from Germany in the Olympics.  He's a real tough judge.  I hope I'll get a high score.  So, who's your favorite Yankee, mullet head rocker? 
[01:41:00]  I like Doug Gita.  Yeah.  Shortstop.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, I was an infielder, too.  All right.  See, it's somebody.  You ever been to a World Series game?  No, never.  No?  I think it's too expensive.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, sure.  Well, stick around.  You might have won our Halloween costume party.  Jack, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  I hate to stick another pin in your balloon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you're not allowed at the stadium with a costume on.  Well, trust me.  We haven't had a costume show on.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you keep calling for them.  I just want to let you guys know.  You guys are terrific.  It's not like the people that are showing up with their costume can't pull out the fake 
[01:41:30]  boobs or take off the wig and attend the game wearing clothes.  It's not like a Mr. Traffic Light guy is showing up.  I think it'll take mullethead rocker exactly five seconds to get out of his costume.  To get out of his costume, exactly.  And he doesn't have to save the wig.  All right, guys.  It's a throwaway.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, Jack.  Every costume has stunk.  Vinny, what's going on?  Yo, Ope.  Yeah.  You are a miserable bastard today. 
[01:42:00]  I love a miserable.  You are just bitter and miserable.  It's been a long two days.  This show stinks.  Like, Anthony's been bitter since the divorce, but you're just beyond bitter today.  I love when I'm bitter.  I've been bitter that long.  I go with it.  All right, my friend, Vinny.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Balls like you that make us bitter.  You suck.  Thank you.  Let me go to Drew.  Drew, you're next on the Opean Anthony Show.  Hey, how are you guys doing? 
[01:42:30]  You guys rock.  All right.  Hey, that guy doesn't want to go to Yankee Stadium.  He wants to go to yank my steady mule.  That's what he wants to do.  You guys rock.  Take care.  He fails out.  Look at him.  He didn't want to know what we thought of his little phone call.  You know what that was like?  Norton, you'll appreciate it.  There's one of those comics that have like three minutes on stage, and they just get up,  rattle out their stuff, and go, well, that's my time.  Thank you.  Good night.  And leave the stage before, like, anything.  You know, like Voss.  Just keep talking before the booze rain down. 
[01:43:00]  I know the struggle.  Thank you.  Have a good night.  I got to say, I talked to Voss.  Yes, this is what an awful creep Voss is.  He bought a Mercedes, and it has 77,000 miles on it.  But it's a Mercedes.  He spent almost 10 grand on a Mercedes with 77.  I hope as you listen to this, Voss, you're hitting a pole.  77,000 miles.  That's all right.  I'm still driving a Mercedes.  What an ass. 
[01:43:30]  What a creep he is.  All right, we're going to go to our ONA archives here.  Ah.  Get some comedy back in the show here.  Yeah.  A little game we love playing, Ant and I, it's called Hi Mom.  Yeah, the Hi Mom series.  The Hi Mom series.  We've done Hi Mom, I'm gay.  Yeah.  Hi Mom, I got fired from work for taking care of myself.  Cranking it in the stock room.  What others?  Hi Mom, I'm in porno. 
[01:44:00]  Right, that was a good one.  Hi Mom, I'm in jail.  Well, that's the one I'm going to play.  Ah, there it is.  But not the one that appeared on our Demented World CD.  No.  This is the Hi Mom, I'm in jail that went horribly wrong.  Because usually at the end of the prank, the mothers get a good little chuckle out of it.  Right.  This lady had no sense of humor and was pretty, pretty sad.  Yeah, this went wrong.  So here it is.  Hi Mom, I'm in jail.  Oh, I thought another costume was coming down. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, a few more are, actually.  Oh, a few more are coming down?  Oh, good.  Oh, look at that.  Hello, Mark.  Yo.  Are you ready to play Hi Mom, I'm in jail?  Sure.  All right, now what are you going to tell your mom when she gets on the phone?  I don't know.  I'm going to tell her I was with a couple of processors.  Wow, that could be pretty good.  That's a good one.  I haven't been to jail in like about eight years, so.  So she thinks you've cleaned up your act, huh?  Yeah, and I'm happily married, you know.  Oh, and you're married and you got caught with the prostitutes.  Yeah.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Okay, cool.  Make this good. 
[01:45:00]  Here we go.  Yeah?  Ma.  What?  Listen, it's Mark.  Yeah?  Listen, I'm in jail.  What?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  I got caught with a couple of prostitutes.  Who's this?  Mark.  It's your son Mark.  Where are you?  I'm in jail.  Downtown.  Don't tell Gina.  I need you to come bail me out.  Who?  You.  With what?  Oh, get away. 
[01:45:30]  I don't know.  You can't.  Don't call.  Don't call my house.  Oh, this call's being monitored, ma'am.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know if he was joking with me or serious or what.  Mom, serious.  Oh, jeez.  We've set the bail at $5,000, ma'am.  That will be cash.  $5,000?  Yes.  What did he do?  He was found with a couple of prostitutes, one of which was a transvestite.  And it's a serious charge, ma'am. 
[01:46:00]  Will someone be coming to pick him up?  Ma.  What?  Can you come?  We've got to clear this up before it makes the paper tomorrow morning.  Who am I speaking to?  This is Officer Jenkins.  Officer Jenkins.  I'll have to call his brother.  I'll call his brother and see if I can get the money.  We know also the prostitute has tested positive for the AIDS virus, which is another problem  he's going to have to deal with.  Hello, ma'am?  Yes, I'm here.  Oh.  Where's Sonny Boy?  Are you speaking up to your mother?  Yeah, ma'am. 
[01:46:30]  Why?  Well, I don't know how to tell you how this happened.  I was with the brain.  You know the brain?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I picked him up with a couple of them.  It's not a laughing matter, son.  I know.  I know.  Your mother sounds very upset.  You try to raise your kids.  You do your best.  I'm sure you did your best, didn't you, ma'am?  Yeah.  And look at what happens.  Oh, my God.  She's so upset.  I can't do this anymore.  I can't do this. 
[01:47:00]  Ma.  Hey, ma.  Excuse me, ma'am?  Yeah.  Happy Mother's Day, ma.  It's a joke.  This was the worst.  It's all a joke.  Oh, I'm going to burn in hell for this, man.  Oh, no.  Ma.  She's all right.  He's fine.  He's not in jail.  It's only...  Ma, you're live on the radio.  You could smack him in the head.  Ma, you still there?  Yeah.  Talk to us, ma.  Look how upset...  Oh, my God. 
[01:47:30]  Dude.  I got to make a phone call.  Did you know she was going to get that upset?  No.  Oh, my God.  Usually I can joke with her, you know.  I'm always joking with her.  Oh, no.  Honestly, I'm always joking with her.  Oh, we feel horrible now.  She's got to smooth things over and call us back, man.  All right.  All right, bro.  Oh, no.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Bye.  Oh, no.  That one didn't work well.  Bye.  Bye.  Welcome to the bottomless kick of ignorance. 
[01:48:00]  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That thing's hilarious.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show on this fine Whip-em-Out Wednesday.  Don't forget, you've got to vote for your favorite boob-a-lantern girl.  Yeah.  The qualifying is over.  It's up to you guys.  You go to opieandanthony.com, vote for your favorite.  Now, what are you basing your votes on?  Is it because I'm kind of, I actually just voted and I'm basing mine, and this is totally 
[01:48:30]  wrong.  I'm basing mine on what their cans look like in the daylight.  I know.  You're supposed to look and see which make the best boob-a-lanterns.  The only reason we got their pictures before they went into the closet was so you could,  you know, enjoy some boobs.  Whether they're good, bad, indifferent.  I just got to tell you something.  And ladies, this is just my point of view. 
[01:49:00]  I am so not into the breast implant thing.  And I've been asked why.  Go to the pictures.  Go to the goddamn pictures.  You'll realize why.  The blonde from Boston has a nice boob job.  Well, they hang a little low.  Which one?  What's her name?  Right here.  Right here.  Right here.  What's her name?  Kelly.  All right.  Let me pop that up here.  Stop it.  You're nice. 
[01:49:30]  Stop it.  Dude, stop it.  That shot.  The second shot.  Nope.  Sorry.  And then you go to the first shot and you realize, yeah, they are hanging a little low.  Okay.  That was one of mine that I am looking at that I'm like, that is not.  Those aren't boobs.  I am voting for the one that just lights up the best.  I like them.  I like implants.  They can look very nice.  I will tell you.  Implants look great in sweaters and stuff.  I am real bare.  I don't mind if they're a little rubbery.  It is so hard for these surgeons to get those goddamn things the same. 
[01:50:00]  That seems to be the biggest problem.  You can't, um, they're not symmetrical.  That one chick, Anastasia.  I can tell the gay guy to sit down.  Hers ain't bad.  They're not, they're not, like one's kind of going a little lower.  But those are pretty good.  They look pretty natural.  But then you look at that one that you just pointed out.  Mm-hmm.  Shelly, I guess.  Shelly from the Boston area.  No, great girl.  Sweet, sweet enough girl.  But I'm looking at those things.  It looks like her breasts were removed. 
[01:50:30]  And then somewhere in her midsection, they replaced, uh, they replanted them somewhere.  That they don't belong.  I like them.  I must disagree, Anastasia.  No.  I like those breasts that would gently rub my face on them.  And Brooke, I don't know what that is.  Oh, I love those.  Those are the ones that look like nose cones to some of the, um, bunker buster rockets that we're sending over to Afghanistan.  It's like a hound dog.  You know?  It's a moose nose.  You don't like the big areola? 
[01:51:00]  It's like, yeah.  It looks like a collie.  There's big and then there's big.  I like it big.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, Jeff.  Jeff, you there, man?  Jeff is pissed off because he said the mullethead rocker guy doesn't sound like a rocker.  What's he supposed to do?  He's in a costume that I, I think he just got out of his, uh, drawers at home.  Juliana.  Yeah, hi.  Hi, what's going on?  I want to come down for the costume contest, but I can't get there in 40 minutes.  There's no way.  It's over in 20. 
[01:51:30]  Well, it'll be worth it, though.  If you let me come down and try, I think you'll think it's worth it.  What are you wearing?  I'm going to be dressed as a hula girl.  A hula girl?  Yeah, like a Hawaiian girl.  Right.  Where are you coming from?  That's original.  Where are you coming from?  Okay, but I got, like, a coconut bra and everything.  Why don't you go as the pregnant nun?  Because that's not a cool costume.  Oh, that one.  Well, we said the contest has to end at 6, so I think we have to stick with that because  this costume blows. 
[01:52:00]  This contest blows.  Contest is, yeah, it's a little much.  But if you let me come down, you'll see my costume doesn't blow.  Where are you from?  I'm from Rockland.  You're not going to get here by 6.30.  No, you're not doing it.  I think you're out this time.  If you want to just come by tomorrow, you're more than welcome, all right?  I just want to do...  Who's outside there, Rick?  We have a couple more people with costumes.  Oh, goody.  So far, the Halloween costume party extravaganza for the World Series tickets. 
[01:52:30]  Stinks.  What do you guys think about Curt Schilling pitching tonight?  What was Norton saying?  I agree with Norton on this one.  Yeah.  I mean, he's a great pitcher.  He's a power pitcher.  I mean, he may be able to pitch on three days rest.  Just have faith in your number four star, you little girly man.  You're up two to one.  Right.  They're getting a little nervous now.  Panicking.  They're going to try to put it away, you know, get that three games under their belt.  And I think it is a panic move.  And I think you're going to see him having a hard time tonight.  Maybe Torrey should put Rivera in the third inning. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Stupid ass panic move.  Just have faith in your other rest of your staff.  Well, we got a pair of tickets to the game tonight at the stadium.  Here we go.  Courtesy of Budweiser.  Hold on.  I got to run down the fine costumes we've had so far.  Oh, sorry.  The rundown.  We had the drunk priest, Danny.  Right.  Who was just making believe that he was drunk for the contest.  Sure he was.  Just in case his wife was listening.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. 
[01:53:30]  Is Patty as super lady in on the contest?  I'm not going to vote for her.  No way.  I don't think she's eligible.  She went to you, too.  Yeah.  She's not eligible.  Then we got the gay bike guy.  Right.  Yeah, the bike guy.  What's his name?  Janna?  Janna.  Janna?  And then we have Zeke the mullet rocker.  Zeke the mullet rocker.  Whose real name's Adam, but he calls himself Zeke.  Now, I know you're at home going, wow, some of these costumes sound really good. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  They all blow.  They stink.  All right.  And now we got two more contestants in the studio for the Yankee tickets.  It's a team act here.  Now, I'm seeing it's a little team act going on there.  I see an army guy.  And I see Osama bin Laden.  Oh, you captured Osama bin Laden.  Oh, that's it.  What is that on your head?  It's a towel.  It is a real towel, isn't it?  It's a real towel.  Going all out for your costume.  I like that.  It's representative, though, of a certain group of baboons. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  Towel on the head.  You got a sheet around you.  And you got a black beard on.  And, oh, look at that.  There's a target on his back, Ovi.  Did you see the target?  Let me take a magic mark on his back.  Wow.  You must have spent at least 20 seconds on that.  Wouldn't that be funny if the real Osama went around with a target on his back?  That would make a great T-shirt.  Why the dead are alive?  Huddle, huddle, huddle, huddle, huddle, huddle, huddle, huddle, huddle. 
[01:55:00]  Well, there you go.  Patty should take the wig off and go as Norton.  Oh, there you go.  It's not bad.  A lot of not bad.  So what's your names and where are you from?  Joe from Queens.  John from Brooklyn.  I thought you were Osama.  Ah, see?  You broke character.  You just blew the whole illusion.  I was really believing that you were Osama bin Laden.  What are you leading Osama bin Laden around with?  It's a noose that we got from a legend.  That's not a noose.  It's a piece of string.  It's kite string.  It's dental floss. 
[01:55:30]  It looks like one of Patty's lips.  You finally caught him and you decide to lead him around with a piece of string  that cannolis are tied up in that little box with.  That's all we can find.  That's all we can find.  In three minutes.  What are you going to do?  Three minutes.  We are a syndicated radio show, right?  Now, when did you decide?  You're contested from Worcester, right?  To do this.  This is big time.  Yeah.  I just had to check.  4.30 today.  You decided we really want to go to the World Series.  Yeah.  What the hell? 
[01:56:00]  You know, they may be in the lead because of the patriotic theme.  I'll stay in costume.  You can't.  They won't let you in.  Oh, they won't let you in for some reason.  All right.  So...  Hey, you guys see Rosie O'Donnell at the game last night?  I got some emails.  I heard she was stuffing her face.  She's having a fat, disgusting face all night.  Behind the plate.  Yeah, if you get those great seats behind the plate, maybe you shouldn't eat anything.  Yeah, maybe you should just sit and if you want to eat, do it when they're in commercials.  All game.  I wonder if she called Derek Jeter a cutie patootie. 
[01:56:30]  She does that sometimes.  Isn't that adorable?  Oh, she's a real card, that Rosie.  That's fantastic, Gordon.  Anyone else notice how pathetic the coverage has been on Fox, by the way?  I know they're advertising.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You used to be able to watch a game and the shot from behind the picture  was directly behind the picture's head.  Right.  So you had a direct shot of the batter and the strike zone and the umpire.  It was dead on center screen.  Yeah.  This year, the shot is off center to the right so they could show that huge billboard behind home plate. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  So they could get their ads in.  Basically saying...  Electronic ads.  ...this ad is more important than what you are watching.  Yep.  You're right.  Anyone else notice that?  It's driving me nuts.  The ads change every other inning, too.  Yeah.  You're getting distracted.  They have a big ad for Ally McBeal and there's action going on.  It's computer generated.  Yeah, I know.  On a big green screen or something.  But still, I mean, they obviously changed the whole camera angle to make sure that, you  know, that is, uh, has, you know, it's in focus and looks nice on TV. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  In view.  Every pitch.  I liked when it was in black and white and the fat guy would run around the bases fast,  like fast motion.  Yeah.  That's what I liked.  I thought it was wrecked after they got rid of that.  Yeah.  The little teeny awful baseball mitts.  Yeah.  Big fat guys running around.  All right.  So you guys, uh, patriotic theme might, uh, might put you over the top.  We only have 15 minutes left in our fine, fine contest.  All right.  I got to tell you something.  Um, there's somebody else in here right now with a, a, a costume on and I can smell the  costume. 
[01:58:00]  What a dish.  This, well, it smells like a fire in here.  Yeah.  That, that, that uniform is obviously authentic and has seen some action.  Yeah.  It's been downtown.  It's been there.  Where, where is it from?  Let's see.  New York state.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  Certified.  Are you a firefighter or is that your boyfriend?  It's my boyfriend.  Yeah.  It's your boyfriend.  So how can we, we can, we got a vote for fire girl.  I mean, being from New York and fire girl, put the helmet on. 
[01:58:30]  Put the helmet on.  No, not that one.  Put the helmet on.  Let me see.  Let me see what you look like.  Yeah.  It smells like smoke in here.  It's probably a cute look.  There you go.  Isn't it?  Oh, how can we not vote?  I'm a cute firefighter.  Come on.  You're very cute.  Everybody loves firemen now.  Who would you go with?  Well, we got the patriotic theme.  We got the fire girl.  So much cuter topless.  I agree.  Yeah.  Is there anything else you want to add to your costume?  Subtract from it.  Or subtract from your costume. 
[01:59:00]  It'll be wowed in a fire coat.  That's never happened to me.  No?  No.  Come on, guys.  Come on.  Oh, no.  She's not.  I'm going to.  Oh, no.  Would you be taking your boyfriend with you?  Yeah.  Unless you guys want to go?  I mean.  Oh, my God.  No, he's a fireman.  I got to bring him with me.  He's, you know, he's my God.  I got you.  Oh, now the pressure's on.  I know.  Do we show patriotism or do we support the fireman?  Well, how much time is left?  Oh, 12 minutes. 
[01:59:30]  And you know a policeman's right around the corner.  All right.  Well.  Putting the uniform on his girlfriend.  You guys will have to, I guess, wait outside.  We'll tabulate some scores and see what happens.  Yeah, we're going to have a winner in about 12 minutes.  So if you're right around the area and you want to rip off a small piece of electrical  tape, stick it under your lip and under your nose and goes, Adolf Hitler, come on up.  That's always a winning costume.  Look, Sig Heil.  All right.  All right.  Well, thank you. 
[02:00:00]  Wait outside.  Well, we vote and vote.  What are we doing?  Go ahead.  There.  She's solid.  There you go.  Beautiful.  I can see what she looks like.  I'll tell you right now, I've got all that equipment.  If she came in here and she had nothing underneath that and then gave us a flash, contest over.  And she sits in the dugout.  Yeah.  We already got her dugout seats.  She can start for the Diamondbacks.  Oh, see, now what do we do?  Because, you know, firefighter.  Yeah, you got to do that.  The two guys, patriotic.  It's a great theme and a great costume, but a bonafide firefighter with his girlfriend. 
[02:00:30]  The patriotic costume took a little more work.  She just put on a...  Yeah, they said they started at 4.  Yeah.  4.30.  Yeah, 4.30.  And it was an hour drive to the city.  Twine.  When is the public going to get back to the good old days and treating civil servants like crap?  Like it used to be.  This guy says he has a costume so good, he can win over the phone.  Oh, there we go.  Ryan?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  How's it going, guys? 
[02:01:00]  All right.  Wanted to see if I can call in my costume.  Okay.  Call in.  Diehard Yankee fan who can't afford to take a chance of missing the beginning of the game  unless he knows he has tickets down there waiting for him.  What?  Yeah.  Say that again.  That was...  Ryan.  I completely didn't understand what you were saying.  Ryan, seriously, we didn't understand what you said.  Say it again.  Something about tickets?  Ryan?  Going once.  Diehard Yankee fan can't get missed the beginning of the game.  What? 
[02:01:30]  Ann Marie from D.C.  Yeah.  Ann Marie, what's up?  Well, I heard Anthony say the thing about not being too keen on the breast implants.  Yeah.  And I have to say, I totally agree with him after I've been to that website.  Mm-hmm.  I was curious the other night and went to look at them.  I think you might want to change the twist on the contest and have us vote for the most  frightening breasts you've ever seen.  Sort of a Halloween theme to it?  The scariest.  Yes.  Eddie.  Never.  Eddie, those are scary breasts, Eddie. 
[02:02:00]  I'm still in shock.  There's a lot of nice racks on that side.  I disagree on this one.  They're really nice.  Well, maybe you've added a few.  I think they look great in an Angara sweater.  Some of them look like, I don't know.  You know how some things just, you know, you can't get them out of your head?  Well, go with the ones that look the best in the dark.  All the way up.  How's that?  All right?  Okay.  Thank you, Ann Marie.  Okay.  Thanks.  Bye.  Tough decision here.  We don't know what to do with our Halloween costume party.  Karloff. 
[02:02:30]  Karloff.  Sidekick.  Karloff did not deserve to smell my...  That limey...  Soccer can rot in hell for all I care.  Something wrong, Bella?  Yeah, if that Yana...  What?  Yana?  Yana?  Yana.  Yana would have come in and said, I'm Ed Wood.  That would have been funny. 
[02:03:00]  He's got wood.  I like to wear women's clothing.  Great flick.  And I saw the real Plan 9 from Outer Space.  Isn't that great?  And in the film, it's exactly as awful as it really was when it was.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Perfect.  It's horrible, and it's just fantastic to watch.  It's not a monster movie.  It's a supernatural thriller.  Let's get Earl's comment on the costumes.  Maybe he can help us out with the voting here.  Earl! 
[02:03:30]  Earl!  Get in here for a second.  Put your lazy ass in here.  Any more costumes coming up?  I doubt it.  Earl, how are you doing?  Have you been looking over?  You might have to be one of the judges along with us for this costume gala event that we're holding today.  Who gets your vote?  Uh, the fireman.  Female fireman.  You like the female fire girl?  I mean, compared to everything else? 
[02:04:00]  Let's shoot this...  This is the most uncomfortable coffin I've ever been in.  Eddie.  Eddie.  I like how he's crying.  Eddie, help me, Eddie.  What's wrong, Bella?  Gotta rent that tonight, man.  So you're liking the fire chick there, Earl?  Yeah, I mean...  Yeah.  It's more symbolic than anything else. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, but I...  Rick.  Go outside and tell the fire chick that it's really close.  And ask her if there's something she might want to do to put it over the top.  Okay.  Hopefully she didn't hear this, Opie.  Might as well try to get something out of this.  Yeah, come in topless under the coat.  What's wrong?  Oh, they're all laughing.  They heard me.  Great.  Oh.  It's all right.  What's wrong with a little topless for World Series tickets?  I've never been to a baseball game.  That'd be good therapy, too, wouldn't it?  Right.  Scott, what's going on? 
[02:05:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm from Washington.  Yeah, I know.  I see that.  Hey, I'm a baseball coach down here.  And if I'm a guy that's going against my Yankees, I'm throwing in my ace because if he loses  tonight, he comes back in game seven, five days rest.  Five days rest.  Game seven.  I mean, that's why they're doing it.  Yeah.  Well, I understand that.  But it shows that you don't have any confidence in...  Well, I mean, you know, you've got to understand, too, that Schilling used to pitch on three  days rest as well. 
[02:05:30]  And he didn't have a large pitch count, you know, in game one.  I just hope he gets torn up tonight.  They probably will rack him tonight.  I hope so.  Well, the odds are against him.  Well, it's been a pitcher's duel, so we'll see.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Schilling won't get knocked around, but, I mean, I think he might lose.  Everyone has their bad nights out there.  You know what I mean?  Oh, please.  I would love to see it.  I would really love to see.  Yeah, odds are he's going to do very well.  I hope he gets shoulder cancer. 
[02:06:00]  I mean, I hate Schilling, but he's good.  I don't think there's ever been a case of shoulder cancer, ever.  How great if he just threw a pitch and his arm flew off and rotted in between the pitcher's  mound at home field.  Oh, like, what's his name for the...  Dave Trevick.  Oh, God.  His arm snapped in half.  What a bad break he got.  Judy, what's up?  Hi, I'm calling from Ontario.  Yeah.  I just wanted to tell you what my costume was and see what you thought.  I obviously can't get down there.  Do they celebrate Halloween in Canada?  Yeah, we celebrate Halloween up here. 
[02:06:30]  Do you celebrate the Thanksgiving in Canada?  Yeah, that's long over with for us, though.  Why?  I don't know.  I guess we're just weird.  I don't know.  But you don't celebrate the same time we do?  No, we're a month earlier.  Ah.  What about the 4th of July?  No, we got the 1st of July.  What a coincidence it was four days away.  What's the 1st of July?  Same thing, Canada Day.  Same kind of thing.  Independent sort of deal.  Yeah, but why is it July 1st?  I have no clue.  You're sucking off for a holiday.  Oh, absolutely.  It's like Kwanzaa, Earl. 
[02:07:00]  Earl, Kwanzaa is a rip-off of Christmas, and it just made up the day.  I don't like when people glom on other holidays like that.  Oh, I just wanted you guys to know that you're starting to get a following over here.  What do people normally dress up in Canada?  An effective military?  Oh, wow.  Fantasy costume.  I can't say anything like that over here.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Don't kill me.  Which is stupid, worthless money.  Yeah, isn't it stupid?  It's like you can buy a park place or something with it. 
[02:07:30]  Do you have change for a loonie?  It's pretty, though.  A loonie.  You know what?  Your money's pretty.  Yeah.  I spent a lot of money over there for those charities.  Hey, we got more costumes.  So, Judy, what were you today?  I am a toasted Western sandwich.  Yeah, why?  I got eggs on the front of my shirt, like over my boobs, and I got a Western cowboy hat on  with toast hanging off it.  You got those fried egg boobs?  Yes, I do.  I got them stuck on the front of the shirt.  Oh, that's a shame. 
[02:08:00]  No, they're nice, but, you know, the picture's on the T-shirt.  I got you.  Your real boobs look like gravy stains?  No, they're not too bad.  Did you lose to Ed Norton because he was dressed like the man from space?  The man from space!  They're not those big, ugly, fake, plastic, glowing kind of.  All right.  Well, thank you, Judy.  More costumes coming in.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  That's pretty good, man.  All right.  Who is out there, Rick?  We got, it looks like a pimp and his hoe.  Yeah, pimp and a hoe. 
[02:08:30]  And Stone Cold.  The guy that, yeah, the guy looks a lot like Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Let's get him in here because we're running out of time.  Ho girl looks like Patty.  Mistress Rhiannon's fake boobs, by the way, when you look at them on the website, they look  like the bean pods from Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  I love them.  And the one that didn't light up and the one that lights up, horrifying.  Yeah.  I'm horrified by this contest.  Wow. 
[02:09:00]  That's pretty good.  The guy looks like Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Yeah, but he was just born that way.  All right.  Well, let's start with the pimp and the hoe here.  It's like kind of an Elvis hoe.  That's Elvis.  Oh, it's Elvis.  Elvis hoe, right?  And you are?  I'm Elvis's pimp.  Elvis's pimp and Elvis.  All right.  Necrophilia costs extra.  Oh, I got it.  All right.  We're a little slow today.  No, we're not. 
[02:09:30]  I'm a little slow today.  I switched to Sanka.  Are you guys heading downtown for the big parade or?  Come on.  That's fine.  Thank you, Earl.  Not tonight.  I'm not feeling so up to it.  You came to work like this today?  No, I just put it on at the end of the day.  We had a little.  We put it on a half hour ago because you knew we had Yankee tickets.  We had a little wacky costume contest in the office.  Actually, the costumes are getting better.  A little better now.  It's too bad we've got to end the contest in a couple minutes here.  You guys had some pretty sad costumes, so I had to come down and fill the void, if you know what I mean. 
[02:10:00]  Now, Stone Cold, how did you get one of those WWF championship belts?  By opening a can of whoop-ass on anybody and everybody who comes in front of me, brother.  A can of whoop-ass using the vernacular.  Stone Cold, you going down to the village tonight?  I'm going to the Bronx tonight, hopefully, to see the Yankees, right?  That's right.  All right, we've got a tough decision here.  We've got one more costume to just get into.  Well, I like the hooker.  I was looking around for the footstool that you guys use when you have Taz in the studios.  I don't see it.  Oh, I got you.  Hey, nice. 
[02:10:30]  And he's talking trash and everything.  Oh, man, Taz hates the short jokes, man.  We learned the hard way.  Taz would kick your ass.  Taz would kick my ass.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, the fire girl's back?  Hi.  Hi.  Yep.  She's, I guess, willing to do something else to enhance her ass.  Oh, boy.  Oh, really?  What would that be, Rick?  What would that be?  It is we who are your fire dogs.  It's Wednesday, right?  Yeah, it's Wednesday.  Oh, yeah, it's Wednesday.  Sure, Wednesday.  All right.  It's been wowed by a fireman, right? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  That would be great.  Usually when the...  Yeah.  Unfortunately, I'm not into man boobs.  Oh, wow, Wednesday.  Oh, wow.  Let's see what...  Well, first, let's just see what it looks like under the jacket.  Very heavy-duty metal clasps on the front of the jacket, Opie.  As she unbuckles that and reveals the true woman underneath.  All right.  Okay.  She's got the whole... 
[02:11:30]  She's got the pants on with the suspenders.  FDNY, the corduroy...  Is that a corduroy shirt?  What is that?  No, it's...  Oh, it's denim.  Denim.  Okay.  Now, slowly take the suspenders off your shoulders.  Stone Cold Steve Austin's enjoying this.  That's right.  Hell, yeah.  Oh, hell, yeah.  Where's the gay bicyclist?  Running.  I don't understand why he's not in here.  No one can see that way, though.  I think he's quite attractive. 
[02:12:00]  It's fun.  We all feel...  Pull this thing!  She's unbuttoning the fireman shirt now.  From bottom to top.  Hands trembling a bit.  Don't be nervous.  Everybody's...  That's cool.  That's pretty good.  Norton will do it with me.  The shaking hands.  Are you wearing a brassiere?  Yes.  You are?  Okay.  That's nothing wrong with that.  Very cute blonde.  Stopped him from bouncing around juicily. 
[02:12:30]  Juicily, did you say?  Right?  Very cute.  She's very cute.  I like the way her hands are shaking.  Yeah.  She's unbuttoning that.  That's great.  It makes it wrong.  It makes this wrong.  Almost picture a gun pointing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  She's unbuttoned.  She's slowly...  Hey, just go as slow as you want.  Yeah.  That's great.  Okay.  Now, slowly off the shoulders would be good.  No, I...  What?  Oh, you're taking the whole thing off? 
[02:13:00]  No, no, no.  She's opening.  She's going to open it.  All right.  She's going to open.  Let's go for the open.  Hey, Rick, if that microphone's in my way for this...  This flash that I know is going to take about a quarter second...  No, no.  Yeah, you got to leave it out a little while.  I...  Just a couple of seconds.  No one's going to do anything bad.  Yeah.  My hand up and down.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  On three.  Sure.  Speaking from personal experience, I don't think she'd be getting too many good tips in  the topless bar.  I do. 
[02:13:30]  Stone cold going to topless bars a lot, huh?  All right.  Here we go.  Hell yeah.  Here we go.  Fire girl.  I've been working up in a few parking lots.  Fire girl.  Most of her clothes off.  Yes.  Here she goes.  Slowly open that up and reveal.  But you're wearing a bra, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  She's shy.  No, the bra's undone already.  It's ready to go.  Oh, is it?  I think that's what you were saying.  No, I don't think so.  Is the bra undone?  Yeah.  No.  This is all just to show us a bra?  No, but...  All right.  Let's go.  What's the matter?  Hold it, please. 
[02:14:00]  What's the matter?  Tell him what?  Stinky, do you know any info on this?  No?  What seems to be the problem?  Fire girl.  You can speak into the mic, honestly.  Yeah.  What's the matter, person?  What?  Oh, no.  It'll be fine.  Are you sure?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  What's going on?  Words of encouragement.  She either has...  Let's just put it this way.  She either rubbed a anthrax envelope all over her chest, or she's had a little acne breakout. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, it's a little breakout problem?  Ah, what are you going to do?  That happens when you're 15.  Oh, stop.  Oh, stop.  Yeah.  That's the problem?  Oh, Saul?  That's all right.  No, it's not a big deal.  Oh, don't worry about it.  Yeah, come on.  You know how many people with pimples I've lured into my vehicle?  It's fine.  I see the pimples from here, so I wouldn't worry about it.  I already saw them.  It happens.  They're fine. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, that's nothing.  That's what you're worried about?  Oh, my God.  Insane?  It's just barely...  Because you're very fair-skinned, and it's barely like just a little bit of red.  It's not...  Nothing oozing or anything.  It's not bad at all.  No.  Of course not.  They look fine.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, please.  They're beautiful.  It's fine.  Believe me.  Let's go.  Go ahead.  Here we go.  Well, you just...  Yeah, that's all you got to do.  And then...  Wow.  Those are... 
[02:15:30]  Beautiful.  Here we go.  Here's the money shot.  This could be for the win.  This could be for the win, Anthony.  This could very well be.  This could be for the win.  This could very well be.  Stone Cold getting really pissed off in the corner.  Stone Cold not happy.  The Elvis ho, not happy.  The pimp, not happy.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's see.  Fire girl.  You're doing good.  Do it from the bottom up top.  Yeah, that way it's not as deceiving.  Speaking from experience.  Here we go.  Here we go.  One, two, three.  Wow.  All right. 
[02:16:00]  That's why it's called wow.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  Oh, I thought we were going to get a rock block.  Oh, wow.  That's it.  That was very nice.  What was the big deal?  Yeah.  Good shot.  Yeah, sound your horns.  Nice.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to figure out who won this contest.  Yes.  We will be tabulating scores between all of the judges here. 
[02:16:30]  And we will come up with the winner of the Yankee tickets.  And we're going to be very fair.  Would you put out a mule if it was on fire?  No.  It's so cold.  It's so cold.  Close your vest.  That's right.  All right.  So, and then.  What happened?  I clammed up.  I'm lame.  You clammed up.  You're lame.  I'm sorry.  You guys did fine.  We were all looking at breasts.  And we got to make sure there's not a last minute costume outside.  A last minute entry. 
[02:17:00]  So, quick break.  And we'll.  I heard that there was one more person on the way up.  But I had to open up a can of wood bass.  And I'm in the elevator.  So, they're not going to make it.  More stone cold stuff.  You know, if I close my eyes, I would think he's standing right next to me.  I know.  No, you wouldn't.  Oh, yes, I would.  Oh, hell yeah.  I see something out by the window.  Is that a costume?  Oh, that's right.  I forgot this guy.  Is this our last costume?  Yeah.  He's got to make it fast because we've got to take it.  Stay out the bushes.  He's in his camouflage.  You just got off work at the post office. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, he's got a gas mask type thing on.  No, actually, that's his paintball suit.  He's wearing a paintball.  Where is he?  I can't see him.  I'm the stay out the bushes guy.  Stay out the bushes.  He's got all kinds of camouflage.  Or the chuckle patch.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Terrific.  We've seen enough.  We're going to have to pen in our scorecards.  And we'll announce the winner next for the Yankee tickets for tonight's game at the stadium.  All contestants, please wait right out that door.  Rick will show you.  We will tabulate the scores. 
[02:18:00]  I'm going to roll him up and smoke him outside.  See?  You didn't clam up there.  That was a good little joke.  There you go.  Firing a zinger on the way out.  Closing big.  You're starting to feel a little confidence and decide to go for it.  Always leave them wanting more.  Just wanted to go with it there, right?  Just wanted to go with it there, right?  There it is.  All right.  Well, my vote is in.  It is, huh?  Yeah.  It's a tough one, though.  All right.  Yeah, I think I know who's going to win this. 
[02:18:30]  The mullet rocker or the girl who wowed with a boyfriend who risks his life every day.  Yeah.  Who the hell are we going to send?  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks.  Great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and A.  My two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a couple of ass wipes.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The suspense is killing me.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:19:00]  We've tabulated scores.  Yeah, well, I know I threw my vote in.  Before I vote, I want to go to the phones and see what they think.  Okay.  Amy, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Um, actually, I think, of course, that you should go to the firefighter, but I call for  a different reason.  Oh, why?  All right, make it fast, Amy.  Okay, I'm a little upset because I never see wow stickers anywhere.  Where are you?  Philadelphia.  Oh. 
[02:19:30]  All right.  There's a lot of wow stickers popping up in Philly.  Every Wednesday, I look.  And if you saw a car with a wow on it, you would flash your boobs on the way home, right?  You know what?  I saw one a couple weeks ago, but he wouldn't let me get up next to him.  Uh-oh.  He was trying to fight traffic, you know, and he just defeated the whole purpose.  All right.  But if you saw the wow, you would definitely flash.  Well, I've been trying to, and I never see any.  All right.  If you see the wow, you'll flash.  Yeah.  And people are getting wow stickers all over the place, and Philly's really taking off.  So, guys, you're crazy not to just put wow on your car and see what happens. 
[02:20:00]  Amy's ready to flash.  Thank you, Amy.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Let me go to Jeremy.  Jeremy, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good, man.  Hey, man.  I don't think that girl should get the tickets.  It was actually like five minutes after six.  You said the contest was ending at six.  She shouldn't get it.  She waited too long to be wowed.  And plus, you had to lead her into it, man.  That's not fair.  All right.  All right.  I'll take that under consideration.  Thank you.  Who do you think they should go to, though? 
[02:20:30]  Thank you.  Tom, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah, I got to greet the last guy.  I think she's trying to use a sympathy rule, you know, with the authentic fire suit.  If she wanted to be authentic, she would have brought, like, a bucket of rubble or corn of booze.  That's not good enough.  I'd say give it to the sandwich girl.  You're going to give it to who?  Give it to the girl who dressed like a sandwich or a salad or whatever else she was.  She was in Canada.  Give it to her.  She deserves a little more effort than the sympathy rule.  What a tool.  She's not here.  Tom, she's in Ontario.  This is her.  All right.  Well.  This is for tickets for tonight's game. 
[02:21:00]  They bailed out.  Punch out, Maverick.  Douche.  Okay.  I'm going to vote here.  You're going to vote?  Mm-hmm.  Everyone write down their votes.  I know who I am.  We got a pair of tickets to the game tonight at Yankee Stadium, courtesy of Budweiser.  Wow.  Our choices.  The drunk priest, Danny.  Yeah.  Superlady is disqualified.  Yana.  Yana Ulrich, the gay bicyclist. 
[02:21:30]  Zeke, the mullethead rocker.  Sounds like a good costume, but it really wasn't.  He kind of looks like Ben Stiller.  He looked like Ben Stiller from Zoolander.  Topless firefighter.  Uh-huh.  Army guy with Osama bin Laden.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Pimp with female Elvis Ho.  That looks like Stalker Patty.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Yeah.  That doesn't sound like Stone Cold Steve Austin, but looks like Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Mm-hmm.  A little warm. 
[02:22:00]  And the stay out of the bushes guy.  Right.  The guy who just came in wearing the paintball game attire.  And there's a guy that showed up, but I think two-legged, the clockwork orange guy.  It's...  Nice try.  No.  Okay, let's vote.  I'm a jock outside his pants for Christmas.  Let's vote.  Ooh, could he come in?  What they wore.  Everyone else voting?  Yeah, vote.  All right.  Are we doing the secret, uh, valid?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I need a pen.  Mm-hmm.  We all have to write it down on a piece of paper, fold it up, and then we will draw that 
[02:22:30]  out of a...  Can I have a piece of paper, Ben, to make the secret vote?  Okay.  Quick, quick, so I can vote secretly.  Well, you're out.  Very secret.  I got my vote.  Everyone vote.  Let's see.  Everyone votes.  Let's see.  Let me take all the votes.  We'll do it like Jeff Probst's way.  We'll just kind of read the votes out.  Let's see.  You got two votes so far?  Votes, votes, votes, votes.  Oh, secret.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Don't pee.  Secret ballot.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Secret, secret. 
[02:23:00]  The suspense is killing all of us.  Secret ballot.  All right, there's Anthony's vote.  Oh, hide yours, Earl.  Hide it, Earl.  I wouldn't want to see it.  You know, we're exercising our freedoms here.  No one's scaring us away from exercising our freedom to vote.  And it is a privilege, not a right.  And Earl?  I gave in my vote.  Did we get everybody?  Yep.  That's kind of associated with the show.  Did you hand in your secret ballot?  Do we have an odd number?  Secret ballot.  Yeah, a tie looks imminent. 
[02:23:30]  Okay, why don't we bring the contestants in?  All right.  There's Stone Cold.  That doesn't sound like Stone Cold.  The fire girl with the pimply chest.  Mullethead rocker.  Mullethead rocker.  Gay bicyclist.  Ed Wood.  The pimp with the Elvis hoe.  The stay out of the bushes guy.  And army guy with Osama Bin Laden with a towel on his head.  That's a fabulous shirt you're wearing. 
[02:24:00]  I love the color pink.  What gay guy?  What?  It's a genuine team Deutsche Telekom issue jersey.  Does it come with AZT?  What do you think of that, fella?  Okay, you guys ready?  It's like a dress as an eight-year-old schoolgirl.  The stay out of the bushes guy is trying to talk through his suit five feet away from the mic.  It's very effective here on the radio.  All right, we all voted, so this is the real deal, okay? 
[02:24:30]  Our secret ballot.  No one will know who voted for who.  We will just take them out one at a time.  Can Rick keep track of...  Oh, wow.  First vote for Steve Austin.  Stone Cold gets a vote.  Give me a hell yeah.  I wonder which guy in the room voted for those big arms.  I love his Stone Cold impression.  I'm Stone Cold!  Yeah, Stone Cold, give us a little more.  It's too good.  It's too good. 
[02:25:00]  It's right on.  Dead on impression.  Get it back on the mic there.  All right, you guys.  Big Yankees game tonight.  Going to tie the series up 2-2.  No, no.  Stone Cold, Steve Austin.  Shut up, man.  He's doing Stone Cold.  You don't hear it?  Oh, I thought he would talk some smack about a wrestler or something.  He sounded more like Stone Cold Steve from Foundry.  I enjoyed his little rant.  Well, he's in the lead with one vote.  Next vote, topless firefighter.  What?  One vote for the... 
[02:25:30]  There it is.  One vote for the...  Oh, you're doing the Stone Cold what thing.  What?  Yeah, see?  There it is.  I was caught off guard.  I looked quick.  I thought it was him.  I thought he walked in.  All right, next vote.  Firefighter.  Uh-oh.  It could be a runaway now.  Two for Firefighter Chick.  One for Stone Cold Steve Austin.  What?  Oh, oh, it's getting interesting.  Well, that was scratched out.  Well, no.  What was scratched out was the, they all suck. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, and then the...  And then, obviously, this is Ben, because he's miserable.  That's not me.  That wasn't him.  Oh, wow.  Another vote for Stone Cold.  We got a 2-8 tie right now.  Next vote.  Fire Chick.  Hmm.  How many votes we got left here?  Somebody's going to have to run in with a steel chair and hit Opie over the head.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, hey.  A little Stone Cold voice with the chair whole thing brought in.  Great.  Army guy in Osama Bin Laden.  Whoa.  I'm proud to say that was my vote. 
[02:26:30]  I went for patriotism.  You did, huh?  Yes, I did.  And the final vote.  Fire broad, you douche.  Guaranteed.  Was that you, Norton?  You bet it was.  How do you even have to think about that?  So, fire broad, you douche.  Puts it over the top, and she is going to the Yankee game tonight.  Courtesy of Budweiser and Major League Baseball.  Who did you vote for, Earl?  Fire Chick?  Who voted? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, what?  You want to know who voted for who?  Yeah, who voted for who?  I voted for Osama and the Army guy, because it looked like they put a lot of effort in there.  Ben?  Stone Cold.  Stone Cold?  You really went with Stone Cold?  Yeah, I just...  Rick?  I went with TF.  Why didn't you go with the fire girl?  Because those callers turned me around, that it was over the limit, and he, you know,  had an actual cost.  Wow.  Listen to those dummies.  Dude, come on.  I'm in rough shape.  He doesn't have an actual cost.  That's how he looks every day. 
[02:27:30]  I might look like this, but it's just stuff.  They just put the leather belt on.  The belt and the stuff.  All right.  Dude, they all suck.  Makeup over my tattoo.  I shave my head.  I shave my privates, you know?  What?  Why would you shave your privates?  Too much information.  Oh, hell yeah.  Okay, Norton, who...  Sorry.  Norton's cursing.  The effing what?  I voted for the fire gal and her boyfriend.  Okay, good.  There you go.  You better take your boyfriend.  Your boyfriend's a true fireman, and is he outside? 
[02:28:00]  And you will take him, obviously?  Yes, I will.  Okay, good.  And Earl, who'd you vote for?  Fire chick.  Just saying.  Pointing is always good on the radio.  On the radio.  Pointing always good.  He's just thinking white woman.  Earl.  I voted for the fire chick.  Thank you.  And Anthony...  Fire chick.  Fire chick, that's obvious.  Okay.  So, well, there you have it, guys.  Steve, who'd you vote for? 
[02:28:30]  I initially voted for they all suck, but I crossed it out.  That was you?  Yeah, that was me.  Then I voted for Stone Cold.  Okay.  Because I didn't want to give it to anybody, just on pure boob contingent, so...  Oh.  Okay, faggot.  Yeah, that's a terrible reason to give away tickets.  You can have fun about it.  And we...  This is the first contest we have not taken pictures for.  Yeah, that's true.  Because maybe it sounded better on the radio than if you saw the pictures.  Well, uh...  Everyone, thank you for coming by.  Great job from everybody.  Big round of applause for everybody. 
[02:29:00]  For our second annual Halloween costume contest.  Extravaganza.  Disaster.  Disaster, yes.  I think it was a gala event, fella.  Thank you, Budweiser.  They suck.  The king of beers and Major League Baseball.  Well, quick break and we might be back.  Some people are already writing on instant feedback.  Since you guys are going to bail out...  No, I don't think we're going anywhere.  I don't think.  Okay.  There should be a picture of this.  Folks at home, Norton looks great as a concentration camp Jew. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, there you go.  From the Bushes guy.  From Band of Brothers.  I loved you this weekend.  Thank you.  Oh, no.  God's a swarthy mustache.  Go away.  She wants to say so.  Fire girl wants to say so.  Fire girl.  I just want to say what's up to 48-56 in the Bronx.  Hell, yeah.  There you go.  That's good.  All right.  All right.  Go Yankees.  Stone Cold, one more impression before you leave.  A little Stone Cold talking some smack.  Next time you got Bubba Ray in the studios, just be sure you invite Stone Cold to the next  Topless Bar and go hang out. 
[02:30:00]  Wow.  Hold on.  That was the fake Stone Cold, right?  Would you...  Because I thought WWF came in with the real Stone Cold and he said that.  I want you to leave my outgoing message on my answering machine.  Yeah.  Because that's what you look like.  Hey, Rick, have him do an ID.  Have him do an ID for the show.  All right.  Yeah.  Go into the recording studio there.  And really do it up as Stone Cold.  We'll play it on the air.  Stone Cold.  It's too good.  It's too good.  Yeah.  Here we go. 
[02:30:30]  Okay.  Could it...  Could that have been the lamest contest we've ever done?  Well, now it makes our Bubba Lantern contest look great.  Yeah, that's good.  By comparison, sure.  I do want to say that was the worst contest anybody's ever done.  Yeah.  I think so.  Well, make sure you vote for your favorite Bubba Lantern.  We got $1,000 to give away.  You got to vote between now and Friday.  At the end of the show, Friday, we'll announce the winner of that contest.  opieandanthony.com to vote.  Norton's got to get out of here.  Yeah, you know...  We're going to make it a great contest. 
[02:31:00]  Best endowed molested retard.  Ah!  I'm saying from today's story, we should get them in here and see who's got the largest  junk.  Maybe next year, Norton.  And raffle off a beating.  It's too bad you have to go, Norton.  You're a mess, man.  We're all a mess.  I got to go to Rascals.  You're going to Rascals tonight.  Yeah.  Tonight through what?  The weekend? 
[02:31:30]  Just through Saturday.  Wow.  All right.  Tonight, tomorrow.  Friday, Saturday.  Man.  And it should be a big show tonight, you know, with Halloween and the World Series not  pulling anybody away.  Oh, sure.  Good luck.  Good luck, my friend.  You're going to need it tonight.  All right.  We'll play What Do We Learn Next.  Pull your pants down.  Can I see your taint whipped cream lesbian?  Can we see your butt?  Let me tell you about my balloon nut.  The OPR.  I'm for me, Sean.  Radio's own slaggy. </pre>
