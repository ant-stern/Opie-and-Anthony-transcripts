<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts’ humorous self-introductions, Anthony particularly boasting about his wealth and dating life. They then detailed their experiences with flu shots and subsequent mild flu-like symptoms.  A significant portion was dedicated to recounting their recent interview with Tim Conway, describing his comedic style as abrasive yet enjoyable.  The conversation shifted to the anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, with Opie and Jimmy sharing their experiences witnessing the rising waters in Manhattan.  This transitioned into a discussion about Halloween plans and childhood memories, including candy preferences (with specific mentions of Tootsie Rolls, candy corn, and Mary Janes) and childhood encounters with bees.  This led to a discussion about declining bee populations and speculation about causes, including cell phone towers.  Several callers shared their own bee-related anecdotes, including one who accidentally set his house on fire.  The conversation then veered to the Red Sox's World Series run, including a humorous song about the team, and ended with criticism of the players’ extensive beards.  The show’s focus then turned to Dexter Manley’s controversial homophobic slur directed at Troy Aikman on another radio show, highlighting the excessive apologies from others involved and contrasting it with the lack of similar reactions to other controversies. The hosts debated the changing landscape of acceptable language, double standards in media, and Manley’s apparent illiteracy; callers offered their opinions on the Manley incident and the Redskins name change.

The show continued with further discussion of Dexter Manley and the possibility of having him as a guest.  The conversation then unexpectedly shifted to the JFK assassination, prompted by the upcoming appearance of Mike Baker from *America Declassified*. The hosts speculated about Baker’s personality and skills, jokingly imagining him as a skilled assassin, and discussed various conspiracy theories, including the “three tramps” and “umbrella man.”  Jim Norton’s changing views on the assassination were also mentioned.  The discussion moved to upcoming guests Aziz Ansari and a humorous aside about Baghdad Bob, followed by a brief discussion of a Jimmy Kimmel controversy and a digression about Jay-Z’s business dealings. A segment from the Beach Boys’ "Surf Safari" album was played, followed by a discussion of Marcia Wallace’s death (with Eric the Midget expressing his grief), leading to a discussion about *The Simpsons*, its longevity, declining popularity, and E-Roc's plans to downsize his toy collection. The hosts criticized *Family Guy*'s humor and discussed their preferred cartoons (*Archer* and *Robot Chicken*). The conversation returned to Jimmy Kimmel's controversy involving children discussing the government shutdown, leading to a critique of political correctness and the fear of job loss for expressing opinions. The possibility of Dexter Manley’s involvement in the Aikman controversy was briefly revisited.  The segment concluded with a call-in interview with Mike Baker, who detailed his *America Declassified* segment on the JFK assassination, explaining his access to the railroad watchtower and his conclusions suggesting Oswald was the shooter, but that other factors may have been at play.

A further discussion of the JFK assassination conspiracy theories focused on inconsistencies in witness accounts and the difficulty of accepting a lone gunman theory.  This was followed by a conversation with Mike Baker, who detailed his experiences filming the Alcatraz escape recreation for *America Declassified*, including the challenges and interviewing a former guard, Patrick Mahoney.  The D.B. Cooper hijacking and its recreation for the show were also mentioned.  A significant portion was dedicated to “Jacktober,” a segment where Opie and Anthony critiqued other radio shows, specifically "Mornings with Melissa and Jack," focusing on humorous commentary on sexually explicit listener submissions on their Facebook page and a prank call segment called "Second Date."  Comedian Aziz Ansari then joined the show in studio, briefly discussing uncomfortable radio appearances and the challenges of stand-up comedy.

The segment transitioned to a discussion of the evolution of media consumption, comparing Blockbuster rentals to on-demand streaming.  Aziz Ansari discussed his career path, his encounters with celebrities like Sidney Poitier and Christopher Walken, and his views on offensive Halloween costumes, particularly those referencing Trayvon Martin.  The hosts and Ansari debated the difference between offensive intent and costumes portraying fictional characters, using examples like *Orange is the New Black* and referencing Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal in *Tropic Thunder* and Sarah Silverman's joke about Asian racism.  They discussed the challenges of long-running TV series and mentioned other comedians and actors, including Nick Offerman and Chevy Chase.  A lengthy interruption occurred due to a rambling, tangential call from a listener seemingly oblivious to the conversation, repeatedly stating her attendance at Jim Norton’s upcoming show.

Early in the show, a heavily intoxicated listener nicknamed "Lady Di" called to announce her attendance at a Jim Norton and Andrew Dice Clay show.  The conversation devolved into discussions of her unemployment, heavy drinking (Natty Ice), and financial situation (supported by an inheritance), much to the bewilderment and amusement of the hosts and Aziz Ansari, who was a guest in studio.  She also mentioned attending a Michael Nesmith concert.  Later, a discussion occurred about a controversial comment made by Dennis Falcone, possibly regarding Nicole (a co-host who had recently announced her pregnancy) and potentially referencing a stillborn child.  This involved the hosts, Nicole, her husband Matt, and several callers.  Numerous sponsorships and advertisements were interspersed throughout the show.

Finally, a segment focused on the controversial comment made by Dennis Falcone, with the hosts pressing him to apologize to Nicole, her husband Matt Biggins, and their newborn baby, Samantha.  Falcone repeatedly claimed his comment wasn't meant offensively and offered apologies.  The hosts expressed hope that Falcone had learned his lesson, ending the show on this note. The segment used confrontational language and vulgarity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yes, they're entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  Fuck.  He's dang open-handed, don't listen to the dang over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do that.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Morning.  Why?  Meh.  Good morning.  And ain't it a fine morning?  Oh, it's just lovely.  Yeah.  Why get the flu shot if it makes you flu-y?  Oh, did you get one of those?  Yeah, I'm feeling flu-y.  Where you go?  The pharmacy?  Yeah, CVS.  Like CVS?  Did the old CVS.  Have some fucking scrub? 
[00:01:30]  Give you a shot?  Yeah.  It's like...  The flu shot has been great for me over the years.  Yeah.  The last five...  I think I started about five years ago.  But I'm feeling just slightly flu-y.  Nothing bad.  Isn't it supposed to do that?  Yeah, sometimes.  Or it gives you a fever for a couple days.  I got the fever.  But this is in place of the all-out flu.  Yeah.  So...  I mean, it's nothing.  Jimmy comes in and just makes a catastrophe.  I know.  These water bottles are broken. 
[00:02:00]  They're the worst water bottles.  They're...  The bottoms are like fucking...  I don't know what happens.  Like...  All bulged out and they fall over.  They try to put too much water in water bottles?  I don't know.  I can't remember.  They bought the cheapest fucking shit water at this place.  Water's water.  It isn't.  That water...  You want to do a water test?  You wouldn't know the difference.  I'll tell you.  Yes.  That crystal geyser.  I like the crystal geyser.  It's a fucking geyser.  It doesn't...  It's not as good as the Poland spring water that I bring from my home.  We used to have that a little over a year ago, but then they switched it out for... 
[00:02:30]  How about we do a water test?  I guarantee you don't know the difference.  Look at how it falls.  I'm literally just trying to push my water bottle over.  Oh, I know.  It happens.  Oh, it's toppling over like Humpty Dumpty.  What the fuck happens?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did the pressure change or something?  Something's amiss.  So just slightly fluey.  Yeah, a little fluey.  A little ache.  A little fieve.  And I'll call it the fieve.  When did you get the shot?  Sunday.  Yeah.  Late Sunday. 
[00:03:00]  I can't believe I ever went without getting it.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  In the end, it's amazing.  I mean, by what?  Tomorrow or Thursday, I'll be fine.  And that replaces what would have been a two, three-week nightmare.  I've never gotten one.  You should.  I've never gotten one.  Well, you don't get sick like me.  I don't fucking get that shit.  It must be alcohol or something.  I do.  It kills everything.  I don't know.  About once a year, though.  Maybe once every 18 months.  I do get a pretty good cough, cold thing going. 
[00:03:30]  But it lasts maybe three, four days.  And then that's it.  You know.  I don't know.  That Tim Conway is a fucking asshole.  Oh, my God.  Was that great yesterday?  I broke that down all day yesterday in my mind.  That was a lot of fun.  And yes, I hid yesterday.  Absolutely.  I fucking hid.  Did you take shelter?  Well, I didn't know, like, I was trying to find an inn.  I didn't have one yesterday, so I didn't want to force my shit.  And then I'm like, you know what? 
[00:04:00]  I'm not even going to look at the guy.  Because he's just looking around the room to just be an asshole to someone else.  And I was thinking, yeah, it was funny and all.  But I think he's an asshole.  I really think he might just be an asshole.  He loves fucking with people.  Oh, my God.  But even off the air, he was doing the same shit.  Yeah.  But here's why he was okay.  Because he enjoyed being teased.  Right.  You could tell Tim Conway, he liked the back and forth.  Yes.  And he liked being made fun of, too.  That's old school comic stuff.  Yeah.  Like, he really enjoyed being smashed. 
[00:04:30]  Like, I can only imagine him and Harvey Korman off TV.  Right.  Going back.  There must have been brutal shit going on between them.  Yeah.  That really is old school, where it's just that cutting humor.  You don't see it as much.  Yeah.  All you have to do is go to a family function, and your older relatives try to do that Tim  Conway shit.  Uh-huh.  But they're not Tim Conway, so it really fucking hurts.  Comes off as mean.  Right.  Or dementia.  Right.  There's not many laughs in there. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I heard off the air, he was doing some pretty funny things, too.  What was that, Sam?  You were talking about yesterday when somebody was saying he was going to the, like, his publicist  or something asked if he had to go to the bathroom, and he goes, no, my bag is in full  yet.  Did he really say that?  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, and he kept, like, uh, making her think that he had Alzheimer's or something.  Yeah, yeah.  And she was like, you remember this building, right?  And he goes, no, have I been here before?  She goes, yeah, for, with Carol Burnett, and he goes, who's that? 
[00:05:30]  Who?  Oh, that's great.  That's just who he is.  Who's that?  Oh, it's fucking funny.  He did something.  Did you catch when he first walked in?  He walked over, he said hello to you, and he said hi to Ant.  Yeah.  And then he just kind of stood behind Anthony for a second, and I'm like, I know he's doing  that to be a, like, he was pretending to know where to go.  Right, right.  But you weren't short first, and then you realize, oh, man, this guy's a dick.  That would be exhausting, though.  I think he's one of those guys that doesn't turn that shit off.  No.  Probably not.  So it's fun to do, like, a half-hour interview and get beat up. 
[00:06:00]  But he probably just walks through life like that.  I thought it was great.  And judging by the feedback from listeners, they loved it.  You enjoyed it, Mike.  Yeah, that makes...  It was just brutal.  That'll make the podcast...  A lot of fun.  When the feedback is way over the top on something, we throw it on the podcast.  Yeah.  That one will make it next week.  And Regan fucking jumps in with a question.  And he's like, and then when he got shit on, he's just like, all right, I'll just sit  here now.  And Tim goes, who's this?  Who's this? 
[00:06:30]  And Regan is, like...  Oh, yeah.  He is huge in the comedy world.  A premier American comedy.  And Conway just was like...  Fuck, yeah.  That was fucking funny.  It was fun, though.  He was really fun, man.  Because he just...  Again, if he didn't laugh and have fun when he got smashed, I'd be like, what a douche.  Yeah, yeah.  But he seemed to want to really take a little bit of abuse.  Absolutely, yeah.  Yeah, that's a sport for him.  Sure.  That was good.  Well, it's another day. 
[00:07:00]  Yes, it certainly is.  That's yesterday's show.  That was it.  Everyone, all the news stations are, like, talking about Superstorm Sandy, which was  a year ago, I guess.  A year ago, me and Jimmy were downtown watching that water rise.  Yes, we were.  That's some scary shit.  You go to the tip of Manhattan, Battery Park, and you see that water rise in front of your  eyes.  Remember, it started coming over the shore?  And there's nothing you could know about it.  Yeah.  And then eventually it went down into the subways and all that.  We were there with all the weather people. 
[00:07:30]  And that guy zipping around on the fucking jet ski.  Yeah, just enjoying the waves.  Crazy shit.  And the news people just couldn't believe that someone would be out there.  I'm like, he's so close to shore and he's jumping waves.  What's the big deal?  This is very dangerous.  We do not recommend you come out here.  Right.  If you don't have to leave your home, stay.  Okay.  But they were amazed.  Like, a hurricane is slowly moving toward us at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  He sees some really cool waves and he's going to jump on his jet ski and enjoy his day. 
[00:08:00]  And then the news people, I just, I don't know what it takes to do something like that.  Yeah.  Super storm sand.  And they're looking at a year ago and what was damaged and how far they've come in the  cleanup and everything else.  Well, I think in general they've done a pretty good job.  I know there's people still suffering and people still living in hotels and whatnot.  But considering what happened, holy shit.  The Seaside Heights got pretty fucked up. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  Jersey Shore, fucking Long Island, South Shore.  I went down there recently, South Shore, Long Island, and everyone's driveway just has  those construction trailers parked in their driveways.  Yeah.  Just blocks and blocks of people still trying to get their fucking houses together.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Well, Godspeed, everybody.  Yeah, Godspeed.  At least, uh...  Godspeed, everybody.  At least it's looking like, you know, not good.  We'll have a Halloween this year.  Because last year the little kitty's, uh... 
[00:09:00]  All right.  Halloween was pretty much canceled last year.  All right.  Pretty much canceled.  What's the matter?  That was in my wheelhouse.  I had to walk around my neighborhood.  Oh.  With my kid.  It was deeply depressing.  Yeah?  Yeah, because we go to Philly because it's very, uh...  It's very homey down there for Halloween.  Literally homey.  No, not...  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Oh, I see what you mean.  But it's a very, uh...  It's a cool neighborhood to trick-or-treat in.  Yeah.  Everyone comes out, a few beers on the stoops.  Ooh. 
[00:09:30]  It's nice.  Yeah.  And last year we were just in...  I mean, I think there's one street on the Upper West Side that allows trick-or-treating  or something.  So everyone goes there and it's just a complete and utter nightmare.  Just imagine, like, thousands of people in one block of the city.  Yeah, that's...  Maybe two blocks of the city.  That's annoying.  It was really annoying.  You're going to Philly this year?  Yeah.  For the old trick-or-treats.  That's why I'm going to miss your party and I'm going to miss, uh, Jimmy at, uh, the  Beacon.  The big party.  It's a big weekend and I'm going to be, uh, out of town. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's more fun for a kid to go house to house, I think.  Oh, yeah.  I actually enjoy it, too.  It's kind of cool.  I think going around and seeing people walking through the neighborhood, it just feels like  it's a weird reality when it's Halloween.  Yeah.  Like everyone's wearing weird costumes.  It's like, in your building, it just doesn't have the same feeling.  Yeah, yeah.  They're riding the fucking elevators.  Yeah.  I forgot.  Thank you.  That's how unforgettable it was.  We actually did trick-or-treat in the building last year.  Something I thought I would never have to do.  Yeah.  Because we did the crowded street. 
[00:10:30]  That was shitty.  Then we came home and then we walked the floors.  It was so, oh, my God, these city kids.  I've got to get my kids out of here.  Yeah, they've got to be raised in a nice suburban setting.  They're going down stairwells from floor to floor.  And some of the floors were set up nice where they, like, turn off all the lights and make  it a little spooky.  Did they do that?  Some did in my building, but most were just like...  Oh, the elevated door opens and some guy, oh, look, it's a little ghost.  We're knocking on doors and they're just coming out. 
[00:11:00]  It's like, it's not the same.  It's not the same of kind of...  Remember growing up with those shitty plastic masks?  Yeah.  You smell your own bad breath.  Your hands, because it used to be cold.  It used to be cold.  For Halloween.  Remember, you would almost feel like you were getting frostbite on your fingertips?  And the snot would run down your nose, but you couldn't wipe it because you had the  dumb plastic mask on.  And then you did the intel, because someone would go, hey, man, we've done this break,  but it's worth almost doing every year.  Hey, man, they're giving out the good shit, you know. 
[00:11:30]  Good candy.  And they would give a number.  Full-size Milky Ways.  And then everyone would run there, and of course they don't have them anymore.  Yeah, so you have to throw eggs.  Right.  And fuck up the poor old lady's house, because she ran out of candy for being nice.  Of course you have to.  I like giving Lorna Dunes.  Those are a marvelous cookie to give to a child.  Just fucking busted up sand on the bottom of some kid's bag.  I just don't.  I mean, we're going into hack material, but I don't understand why they make candy corn. 
[00:12:00]  Who eats that?  Yeah, it's just a sicko.  Everyone tries it, because it's around, and it looks like it should be way better than it  is.  Waxy flavorless shit.  How are they in business?  I don't know.  You can't give away that shit.  How are the candy corn people in business?  You know what?  They make so much good shit now.  Really good shit.  You can just go to the store, buy bags and bags, a little mini fucking...  The Mary Janes, the candy corns.  Mary Janes.  Another horrendous candy.  Old is that? 
[00:12:30]  But the bid is a little different this year.  It's like wrapped in parchment.  Right.  Why the fuck are they still making those candies if no one likes them?  No.  I don't understand.  Yeah, they still fucking hammed them out.  I'm going to throw one out there.  It might be a little controversial.  Uh-oh.  The Tootsie Roll.  Yeah, I don't know.  People still digging the Tootsie Roll.  I don't dig a Tootsie Roll.  I don't know what it is.  It's not chocolate.  Do you like a Tootsie Roll?  I'll eat a Tootsie Roll.  Well, I don't necessarily like a Tootsie Roll. 
[00:13:00]  I think that's how their business is getting by.  People will eat a Tootsie Roll, but they're not enjoying a Tootsie Roll.  I don't go out of my way to get a Tootsie Roll.  No.  I'd rather have a fucking, you know, a nice piece of real chocolate.  Right.  I don't know what a Tootsie Roll is.  Is it supposed to be chocolate?  I don't know.  But if you go...  The fuck is it?  But if you go to a candy store, you're going to pass up everything else to reach for the Tootsie Roll?  No.  No.  Of course not.  Tootsie Roll.  What a dumb name, too.  You can tell how old the candy is by the name. 
[00:13:30]  Toots.  Toots.  Hey, Toots.  Hey, Toots.  Some old fucking gangster was being shit on by a flapper back in the 20s.  Hey, look.  A Tootsie Roll.  Good old Halloween.  That means Thanksgiving and Christmas or...  How does that happen?  I know.  This is a big...  Wasn't I just on a beach making fucking holes for fires? 
[00:14:00]  I hear you.  Fuck.  It goes pretty quickly.  This time of year especially.  It just is one after another.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm not a fall kind of guy.  No?  No.  That's...  Fall is for people that are like, you know...  I like waking up early.  Getting out in the brisk, crisp weather.  Ah, you inhale that brisk, crisp cold air.  Fuck you.  I love the heat. 
[00:14:30]  I like to change the seasons from here.  No.  No.  No.  I laugh at everyone on Facebook that says, oh, fall is my favorite time of year.  Yeah, shut it.  It's everyone's favorite time of year.  Not me.  I'm talking about the masses.  Summer is king.  Summer's the shit.  Fucking outside.  It's light out late.  You're grilling.  You're fucking drinking outside.  It's just great.  Then fall comes around and fucking close up everything.  The landscape came yesterday. 
[00:15:00]  It was like they were making a fire break in my yard.  They cut every piece of vegetation down.  Because that's what they do.  They cut everything down and fucking haul it out of there.  And now it just looks like a barren, shitty backyard that I got to stare at until spring.  Why do they cut everything down?  I guess that's what they do.  Just to make way for...  Just keep everything healthy?  Yeah, keep it nice.  And the next year it all grows back.  But, yeah.  The sugar daddy.  John of Long Island.  That's another old school fucking...  I think I've been called that many times.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Sugar daddy.  Uh, John of Long Island.  Ugh.  Yeah, remember the sugar daddies?  They used to get so hot and sticky and you'd peel it off and the paper would stick to the sugar daddy.  But you ate it anyhow.  Yeah.  They were like the best.  I love them things.  Oh, you liked the sugar daddy.  I loved them.  They were great.  You could pull out three fillings in one bite with a sugar daddy.  And possibly a tooth.  A whole fucking tooth.  Yeah, if you put the sugar daddy back by your molars and bit down on it, it wasn't coming 
[00:16:00]  out without ripping pieces of your fucking teeth, gums, fucking...  You could do it your own root canal with a sugar daddy.  Fucking horrible.  I don't know what it's made of.  Yeah.  Concrete.  Call up with your favorite candy, everybody!  All right, brother.  Have a good day.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm going to try to change it up a little bit.  I'm just amazed some of these fucking candies are still in business.  That's all. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  That's just my dumb little point.  They, uh...  I mean, Jesus.  I remember trick-or-treating and getting, like, some horrendously old candy.  And we've talked about that.  The wax bottles filled up with the colored liquid.  What's the...  You don't even know what it was.  It looked like a little six-pack of soda bottles.  Right.  But they were waxed, and you bit the top off and sucked out this...  Old school.  This red dye number five cancer agent.  And then you just chew the wax like it's gum.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  I'm chewing wax.  That's what our...  That's what us poor people did, because we couldn't afford the gum.  The wax teeth.  Yeah.  You'd put in the wax teeth and then eat it.  That was dumb.  The wax teeth.  You'd put it on.  It was big lips and fucking wax teeth.  Right.  And I was going, hello, howdy there.  Yeah.  What about that mothball-y candy?  Oh, what...  The fucking, um...  The malted milk balls?  Malted milk, yeah.  Malted.  Oh, God, that shit sucked.  I would just continuously pop those in my mouth, though. 
[00:17:30]  Really?  It made a unique, crunchy sound.  Yeah, it was very light and airy.  And why didn't our stupid generation, you know, discover dark chocolate?  We had the cheapest chocolate ever.  It was all cheap chocolate.  What was the problem with the people around us?  They didn't understand that dark chocolate is pretty fucking tasty?  I just wanted regular old chocolate, and you bring out this gourmet shit.  I don't like dark chocolate at all. 
[00:18:00]  I love dark chocolate.  It's just kind of weird.  Especially when they mix it up with a little shit, a little bit.  I'm working on a Carmel one right now.  Yeah, that's fine.  With some sea salt.  A little ghetto, but I like your basic flat, dumb Hershey bar.  Yeah.  You know?  True.  It's a weird little texture.  What about the Junior Mint?  Oh, it's delicious.  It's very refreshing.  You can only have like two or three.  Yeah.  It gets kind of obnoxious. 
[00:18:30]  I like a good Junior Mint.  Do you?  It's a Junior Mint.  Yeah.  Was that Kramer?  Yeah.  It was very refreshing.  That's when he flicked it up to give it to Jerry,  and it flipped out and went into the guy having surgery  and actually cured some of it, one of his ailments.  Yeah.  It was a fun one.  The Junior Mint.  I'm trying to get rid of a 20 plus year coffee habit.  How's that working out for you? 
[00:19:00]  Probably because that's probably why I'm feeling flu-y, by the way,  because if you look it up online, man,  trying to get off caffeine is a motherfucker.  And someone suggested green tea with brown rice.  The fuck is that?  The fuck is you're vomiting and you don't think of drinking anything.  I can't possibly be a good alternate.  So I'm having, I've been drinking like a Starbucks green tea,  which I just don't like.  It makes me fucking nauseous and shit.  So this is horrible. 
[00:19:30]  How am I going to get off coffee?  I'm trying to find something I could drink in its place.  Wait, that's green tea.  Green tea with brown rice.  Wait, wait.  Roasted brown rice.  Roasted brown rice in the tea.  Yeah, I guess in the tea bags.  All right, that's crazy now.  Now that's just some crazy shit.  Someone says it tastes much better than just regular green tea.  What's wrong with coffee?  No, what's wrong with like regular tea?  Still the caffeine?  I don't feel like feeling my fucking veins every morning anymore. 
[00:20:00]  Too much coffee over the years.  What about decaf?  Decaf coffee?  Yeah.  Have some Sanka.  That might work.  That's Sanka.  But decaf coffee just blows.  You can tell the difference.  Some of that taste is choice.  But this getting off coffee thing is brutal.  Yeah.  It's fucking brutal.  I knocked it all the way down to one tiny small cup of coffee a day.  I used to do four or five huge fucking cups a day. 
[00:20:30]  I'll enjoy a good espresso with dinner.  You're not a coffee drinker.  You're lucky.  I'm not a coffee drinker whatsoever.  You are lucky, my friend.  Like a little tea with honey when I'm feeling a little under the weather.  Yeah.  Maybe honey will jack this shit up.  Isn't honey a superfood?  You know, honey is pretty good shit right there.  I got turned on to peanut butter and honey sandwiches this summer.  Okay, no.  They're fucking pretty damn good.  Honey's weird with bread.  Pretty damn good.  You put it with some peanut butter.  They were made for each other. 
[00:21:00]  By the way, I don't know where people are getting honey these days because there are no bees left.  I don't know what happened.  But that's another thing I remember from my youth.  You remember in the summer.  I'm laughing.  Hey, the line's hilarious, but your face.  I'm horrified.  That's why we got to have a visual.  I'm horrified.  Like in a song ghost.  When you were a kid, and I know you know this, by any trash can in the summer where kids 
[00:21:30]  are throwing their Coke cans and fucking cake and shit like that, there would be a fucking  mob of dangerous bees buzzing about the garbage pails.  City streets, even, on the corner during the summer.  Again, dangerous bees everywhere.  Now, you don't even see them buzzing around your garbage.  When you do see one, you completely freak out because you're not used to seeing them anymore.  Yes. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Again, my backyard during the summer, very, very flowery.  Lots of flowers and fauna.  And nary a bee to be found.  Really?  Yeah.  Doing their old pollination thing.  They say the bees are going away because, what, the cell phone towers or something?  Is that what they...  I thought they didn't know.  Oh, it's them.  They're finally starting to figure it out.  Supposedly, it's the cell phone towers are fucking up their shit.  Wow.  Making them confused and stuff.  I have no idea what it is. 
[00:22:30]  Not good if we lose the bees.  You know that, right?  Bees are pretty important.  Worst if we lose phones.  The ecosystem.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck the bees.  It becomes between our phones and bees.  That was part of being a kid, too.  Just battling the yellow jackets.  Battling bees.  And the bees and whatnot.  You were in a constant battle with fucking bees.  He's trying not to get stung.  Remember the floaty wasps?  I call them the floaty wasps where they had that extra part and they would just kind of hover.  And their legs would swing back and forth. 
[00:23:00]  Their giant legs hanging down.  They were frightening.  You would take a yellow sting, a yellow jacket sting easy.  That wasp shit would scare the fuck out of you.  I was petrified of getting stung by anything.  You got stung as a kid, right?  We all did.  Oh, yeah.  And boy, I swear, the screams I would let out when I got stung.  The worst.  Running home.  The worst.  My father would, of course, call me a faggot and tell me to put some ice on it. 
[00:23:30]  And then I'd have to run to mommy, you know, because she would give me a little sympathy.  She would give you a tip.  He got stung by a bee, Joey.  Fucking bee!  Who gives a shit, bro?  Jesus.  You're just a kid.  It was my summer.  But as a kid, it was like you were battling monsters in your yard.  Right.  It was a monster that could hurt you.  Absolutely.  Fucking bees.  And now...  They're going away.  They're not even around.  I don't know what happened to them.  Godspeed, bee.  Godspeed.  We used to catch them in jars. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm so afraid of them now, but when I was a kid...  You would catch bees in a jar.  I would catch a jar and, like, go down to the grass.  And I remember we would see who could get the most bees randomly in a jar.  And I remember I got 43 into a jar because I kept thinking the next one was Reggie Jackson's  number, 44.  Oh.  And I couldn't get the last one.  Did it bother you?  I don't remember if I got it or not, but the wasp, the bees.  Were you the guy that would catch the bees and the top of the dandelion in the jar at  the same time?  Yeah, sometimes you had to.  No. 
[00:24:30]  He was a wasp.  No.  Whatever.  I wouldn't like any flora in my jar.  I wanted just bees.  Yeah, reach in and pull it out.  Then we're going to tell you.  No.  You had to wait until he flew up a little in there.  Coom, coom, coom.  No, it was hard to do when you had a jar full of bees.  That was part of the fucking intrigue of the whole game.  I don't think we did bees.  We did fireflies.  Oh, they can't hurt you.  You can catch them with your cock head.  Cool.  Run around the yard with a jar full of fireflies and then you got bored and put the jar down 
[00:25:00]  and the next morning they're all dead.  Dead.  He's just a loser fucking kid that doesn't have any awareness yet.  How horrific is that for the poor bug?  What happened?  I was flying around.  What about the dome?  What about killing it after they were just burning fucking ants?  Burning ants or any other bug with a magnifying glass.  Like a big giant monster.  Just being a fucking unaware idiot.  Yeah.  I saw something online with these Japanese hornets that we've all seen.  Oh, yeah.  Those are crazy. 
[00:25:30]  But this guy makes this potion out of them.  What?  And he's like one of these 80-year-old Japanese guys who's fearless.  And he was just standing like where these Japanese hornets were.  And he was catching them with this net.  Just like no mass, nothing.  Oh, my God.  Net.  Catch bee.  These fucking, these thumb-sized hornets.  And he had a jar of honey.  And he takes the hornet.  And he opens the net over the jar of honey.  And he taps it until the hornet falls into the jar of honey.  And he would get like six or seven of them.  Wow.  From this little mini, I guess, cluster of them that was floating around. 
[00:26:00]  I would assume they would die in the honey.  But some of the, but they slowly suffocate and they can't get out.  It's really kind of cruel.  Of course it is.  But it makes like this elixir or something in Japan.  To make their dicks hard.  Exactly.  It is one of those dumb things.  Of course.  So they get pixelated out in pictures.  Some of them take ten hours, they said, to actually, before they will give up fighting.  And then you're watching these things struggle.  Right.  And you actually feel bad for these shitty hornets. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  You shouldn't do that to any living creature.  Just flick its head.  It's me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cut his little dumb fucking head off.  His little triangular fucking head.  Let's go to Max.  He wants to talk about the phone towers and bees.  Max.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Max.  Hey, Max.  Take my call.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was working on cell phone towers in Ohio for a little bit there.  And when you're up in the tower, it's just swarmed and swarmed the bees.  They're attracted to the RF signals.  Oh, maybe they're up there. 
[00:27:00]  Then they get radiation poisoning and die.  Yeah.  Then what happens?  I mean, they're probably about 400, 500 feet up in the air just forming the towers.  They build nests up there.  It's insane.  Oh, no.  They build that.  That might suck for you guys.  Oh, man.  Oh, it's terrible.  When you're trying to change out an antenna, hanging over the edge, getting attacked by bees.  So wait, where would the bees, like if the antenna's hanging over the edge, where would they nest?  Well, up there we got pipes and platforms, so it's basically just like a house almost.  It'll just be all over there. 
[00:27:30]  Wait.  You're not scared of heights, obviously.  I was.  Four to 500 feet in the air, huh?  Yeah.  It's pretty intense.  Holy shit.  That's a crazy, scary job right there.  Did you get stung?  A couple times.  My foreman was up at 1,200 feet, and there were bees up there, too.  So what did, how do you get rid of them, or do you smoke them out, or what do you do?  We didn't really have anything to counteract them up there.  So you're just working with fucking a bee nest?  Fuck that. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, just go up there, kill some time, come back down, and go, okay, I took care of what  needed to be done.  Yeah.  You go check.  Just have a can of Raid.  Right.  Go up there with some Raid.  We used to have to do that in attics when we were working, and there was a bee's nest in  the attic you were working on, and you'd go up there with some Raid and just start spraying  it at the nest, and the bees would go crazy for a little while.  Oh, scary.  No way.  You're in a tight, confined, hot space with the bees.  Oh, nasty. 
[00:28:30]  I love those fucking, whoever, like, remember years ago it was just regular Raid, and then  they designed the wasp can?  Yeah.  Which was like a fucking fire.  I guess because they realized that you're getting, you know, you're eight inches away,  something's going to get to you.  Yeah, you could go pretty far away, and just that stream would come out of that funnel-shaped  nozzle.  Yeah.  Tsunami of chemicals.  I work on, like, an anti-aircraft gun.  You could track them as they're flying.  Oh, it was a lot of fun.  Great weapon, too.  Yeah.  Nice face.  You want some bee stories? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, I love bee stories.  Oh, man.  All right.  Let's go to Dutch in Connecticut.  Dutch.  Hey, buddy.  Being a typical kid, we had a nest, like, just under my sister's window in her room,  and I thought I helped my dad by spraying them, and, you know, I tried the Raid thing,  but then I found, like, if you light a match, like, hairspray, I thought that would help.  And it hit the hive, and next I know, it kind of started catching the house and the garage.  And my dad was a defense instructor in the Marine Corps, Anthony.  Yeah.  He made your dad look like a fucking saint, all right? 
[00:29:30]  When I had to go explain to him that the house was on fire, it didn't go over very well,  to say the least.  No, I wouldn't say.  Those fucking bees nests, they're made of paper.  What are you doing?  Of course it's going to catch on fire.  It just seemed to make sense.  Paper and wax.  Bees wax in there.  That's like a fucking flammable combination right there.  It's a flamethrower.  It's perfect.  They're coming out.  They're flying out of the hive on fire.  I feel pretty good until I look up, and my sister's room, like, the flames are starting to come out of the room, 
[00:30:00]  and I've got to go tell my dad.  Yeah.  That's wild.  Punch it out, boys.  All right.  Thanks, Dutch.  Let's say hi to Darren in Texas.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey.  We're just kind of chilling out, talking about bees.  Talking about bees.  Well, I just moved to this total shitneck little town in the middle of nowhere, Texas,  and apparently everybody here in this town is some form of beekeeper, and they collect 
[00:30:30]  all this local honey, and I know they distribute it or whatever, but everybody in this town is  like a bee wrangler.  Yeah, I guess there's beekeepers and stuff, and that's where the honey and shit comes from,  but it seems like the wild bees are just not as numerous.  No.  Not as plentiful.  Well, they're definitely not as prominent, but they are talking about how our planet is 
[00:31:00]  supposed to be, you know, repollinating itself.  Oh, yeah?  So, they have plans in place, but the bees are never going to fully go away.  Well, I hope not.  Well, we knew a guy...  This has been a thrilling topic, and I know you're really the fuck out of my conversation  this morning.  Well, we knew a guy, actually, who had bees, and he would do...  He had hives and stuff.  But there was this one cruel kid that he would bring his stupid cart of honey jars around, 
[00:31:30]  and this guy just took his honey jars and dropped them on the ground and broke them.  Oh, that's very mean.  Yeah, it was very mean.  They had to give a dull, thick thud.  That thick fucking thud of the honey jar busting open on the ground.  Hey, Tuma!  Tuma!  Tuma got his.  Boy, did he.  He made red, and those guys come to his house, and then he fucking yanked the beehives,  and they all got stung.  Yes. 
[00:32:00]  They weren't very happy with that.  Well, you got the Red Sox one game away from the old World Series there.  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  What are you talking about?  What?  What are you talking about?  Well, I'm talking about the Red Sox.  The Red Sox for winning the World Series?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  The Red Sox go boom. 
[00:32:30]  Boom.  Playoffs now.  Uh-oh.  Valentine fired.  Fans cheering loud.  Loud.  Fenway Park.  Big poppy.  Uh-oh.  Play is back with Gomes and Napoli.  Pitching staff with Lester's K's.  And our bats go pow, pow, pow.  But there's one song that we all know.  What does the Sox say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win. 
[00:33:00]  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  What does the Sox say?  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer.  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer.  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer.  What does the Sox say?  Green, green, green, green, green, monster.  Green, green, green, green, green, monster.  Green, green, green, green, green, rawr.  Green, green, green, green, green, monster!  Wow.  There you go.  Fucking hilarious.  Wow.  What an awful... 
[00:33:30]  Why did Boston have to go so far?  All the way to the World Series.  Now they can wrap it up with one more game.  It's those creepy beards.  When did they start growing that?  That is really fucking stupid.  They look like Al-Qaeda.  They look Amish.  Now they're shaving their heads on top of it.  Fucking...  It's just a...  It used to be a playoff beard.  When did they start?  Like last year they started growing beards?  Yeah.  Those beards look like a year old, right? 
[00:34:00]  They look like degenerates.  I like a good team, but like the Yankees.  All nice, well-groomed.  I like the beard thing.  Look at that shit.  Fucking...  They ain't fucking around.  Look at that.  Steinbrenner used to tell those boys,  you keep your hair fucking tight.  And none of them beards...  Holy shit, we're looking at pictures.  They fucking just look like filthy hillbillies.  What happened?  When did they decide?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  Because that's not just a playoff beard. 
[00:34:30]  Pretty quickly.  I don't know.  That seems like...  They must have started at the beginning of the season at least.  No, that beard's got to be fucking...  Yeah, that's the beginning of the season.  That's ridiculous.  Right?  That looks like fucking two years.  That guy can grow a fucking St. Nick beard.  That's young St. Nick.  That's Kris Kringle.  And then, of course, you've got to shave your head after you've got the big beard.  Oh, God.  Do you find it fun when they do the crowd shots and people have the fake beards on? 
[00:35:00]  Fake beards on.  Ew, do they?  Oh, yuck.  Oh, yeah.  That's a thing.  That's a thing now with the Austin fans.  It doesn't look like old St. Lou has a shot here, huh?  I don't think so.  Going back to Fenway.  Going back to Fenway and Boston only needs one. 
[00:35:30]  Is it 3-1 or 3-2?  3-1.  That's bad.  That's bad, right?  You know how I knew they lost again?  Because I follow Geezer Butler on Twitter and he lives, I think, in St. Louis, which is  a weird place for Geezer Butler to live.  Right.  But he was tweeting about the bloody Cardinals, and that's how I knew that they lost.  There you go.  I follow my baseball through fucking a British basis.  Yeah.  That shows you how far removed I am from sports.  Yeah.  Speaking of sports, you've got Troy Aikman being called a queer. 
[00:36:00]  This is...  Being called a queer.  This is great audio, by the way.  I listened to this yesterday.  It's not even so much...  Now, who called him a queer?  Dexter Manley.  Dexter Manley.  Was on a radio show, and calls him a queer.  And it's not even that.  That isn't even the highlight.  The highlight is the utter and complete fucking panic that sinks into the rest of the show.  Right.  The people that are...  What show was this on? 
[00:36:30]  Just some, like, AM, I think, talk show in D.C.  Yeah.  They fucking go into defensive apology, groveling, trying to separate themselves mode instantly.  Is Dexter Manley part of this radio show?  No.  No.  Who gives a fuck?  He was a frequent guest.  Do you know, I was like...  I listened to it, and I listened to their groveling, and I got annoyed.  But then I was like, you know what?  These guys are in a bad spot because you're afraid your gig can get taken if you don't 
[00:37:00]  immediately...  Oh, I don't blame the host.  That's just it.  That's just it.  So I wasn't annoyed at them for a while.  I absolutely...  Yeah, I don't blame the host, but it's...  Like, if they would have laughed or something, or, you know...  Right.  It's like, uh-oh.  Who said that?  Who said it?  Who laughed?  Who was in the room?  We know.  We've been through that.  Let's hope that they'll recover on Sunday when they play against the Chargers.  Maybe it was an AFC team or something.  I'm hoping that they can redeem themselves come Sunday.  Wasn't it a big jinx that Troy Aikman was doing the game? 
[00:37:30]  The former Cowboy?  I think Troy Aikman's a queer.  Uh-oh.  Phil.  Oh.  Oh.  I think Troy Aikman's a queer.  First of all, what is Dexter Manley even thinking?  That he played against them, he probably knows.  He thought he was going to get the room laughing on that one.  Does he not understand...  Oh, is that great.  Does he not understand the fucking climate we live in these days?  Yeah, but it's that whole...  I mean, but he should know, because if someone dropped... 
[00:38:00]  If he dropped an n-bomb in front of him, he'd probably lose his fucking mind.  A white guy?  Ex-ball player, dude.  He's not paying attention to that stuff as much.  Oh, God.  I don't think he means queer in the dick-sucking way.  No, probably not.  It's probably a joke.  I think he did.  But he's probably just joking.  But joking.  I'm like, yeah, he's a cocksucker.  That was probably a real rumor.  Because there's always been rumors that Aikman was gay.  And he probably believes it, but was saying it in a ball-breaking way.  Is he married?  I don't know.  But I've heard for years that people thought he was gay. 
[00:38:30]  Was it a big jinx that Troy Aikman was doing the game?  The former cowboy?  I think Troy Aikman's a queer.  Hello.  But he gets his name wrong.  Troy Aikman.  I think Troy Aikman's a queer.  Troy Aikman.  I think Troy Aikman's a queer.  That could be the best part, his name.  Troy Aikman.  Oh, boy.  I think Troy Aikman's a queer.  Troy Aikman.  Well, we don't want to go there.  Okay, I'm sorry about that.  Now, do you want to apologize to him?  No.  You don't?  I'll just say I take that back.  Okay. 
[00:39:00]  Says he's a cowboy fan.  Right.  Well, we don't want certainly anyone to think that anybody endorses anything.  I like that, Dexter.  Because that is, you know, really not an area that we want to go into.  Okay.  I apologize.  Dexter, always good to see you.  Thank you.  Thanks for coming in.  Get the fuck out.  That's it.  Dexter, good to see you.  Get the fuck out.  Don't ever come back.  Yeah, I mean, they have to do that as hosts.  Yeah, they do.  And then they have to cover their asses.  Because your bosses do not protect you anymore.  No.  They just let you fucking... 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, the station put out a statement saying that he will never be on the show again.  It's amazing.  Oh, God.  It's a fucking cunt.  Like, the guy said queers, joking.  He said he was sorry.  Like, he's just a football player joking around.  Yeah, yeah.  Do we...  Is there no...  We can't differentiate between that and a guy truly being hateful?  No.  No.  God, what a dumb country.  Not anymore.  It's done.  We would have Dexter Manley on in a second.  I would love to have Dexter Manley on.  He sounds hilarious with that.  Treikman.  Treikman.  But by the way, that's to me... 
[00:40:00]  Do you see how that was handled?  Yeah.  And then you look at the way they handle the Redskins with the fucking name.  Oh, we ain't changing it.  He says queer.  Gone.  Gone.  Supposedly, the Redskins are meeting with the NFL.  They're going to change it without a doubt.  They're going to fucking fold.  The Bravehearts.  That is just fucking disappointing.  What's another choice they had?  I said the Washington... 
[00:40:30]  Colin, I want to spit on him for thinking of this.  He's been tweeting the Washington R-words.  That's the Redskins.  The R-words.  Oh, it's enraging.  Oh, we got something on Dexter Manley now.  Let's say hi to Tommy.  Tommy.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Tommy Salami.  Hey, hey, hey.  No salami here.  It just was hanging between my legs.  Ooh, delicious.  I was going to say, on the Manley, wasn't he the illiterate player that couldn't even read, 
[00:41:00]  but he's calling someone to queer?  It sounded like Dexter Manley was queer when he said it.  But you know what?  If he said that, if he is illiterate, then maybe he's just not reading the paper and paying  attention to the climate.  Someone like Dexter Manley doesn't need to read.  Oh, yeah.  He was a standout in his sport.  He had so much money, he could have someone just fucking read for him.  Did he play for a college?  Redskins.  Oh, yeah.  Did he play for a college?  Oh, wow.  And he can't fucking read, right?  That's why he could play and make the money, but he lost it all. 
[00:41:30]  We all know what goes on with the student athletes, though.  War is bad, it makes me sad.  That's not right.  War is bad, it makes me sad.  Fucking millions of dollars.  Carmelo Anthony.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Chris in New York.  Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Boys, check it out.  Listen, you got it wrong on the World Series.  It's a mess of three right now.  They still have three games to play.  And it's anybody's game at this point. 
[00:42:00]  God forbid these big, ugly animals win this game.  They're out of the series.  The fuck are you talking about?  I know what you're saying.  It's kind of a cliche.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The World Series.  They just played four games.  They're even.  No.  No.  What?  The Red Sox need one game out.  Red Sox need one win.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  The Red Sox are up three to two.  Yeah.  We all know that.  On three to two, you said three to one.  But it is three to two.  Three to two is different.  But it is not two to two. 
[00:42:30]  Did I say three to one?  Yeah.  That's a big difference.  They won three to one last night.  I'm sorry.  Oh, okay.  Three to two is different.  Okay.  But the Red Sox still need one game.  Yes.  Oh, I was in a coma.  I missed the whole goddamn game.  But anyway, fuck that big monkey David Ortiz.  Goodbye.  All right.  Bye.  I said that.  I apologize.  Jesus.  No, I know.  I mean, college don't make no sense.  I know it's three to two.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mikey.  Hello there, guys.  Welcome there, Mike.  How are you?  Anthony, you've got to keep up the good fight, buddy.  All right. 
[00:43:00]  What does that mean?  You hate the colored.  Mike hates the colored.  No, no, no, no.  Just hate Obama.  The liar?  The liar in the White House?  What do you got, Mike?  The liar, crooked, corrupt liar.  Dexter Manley signed his NFL contract with an X.  Did he?  Yeah.  Look, he didn't sound like a genius.  He thought he was going to say, Troy Aikman is a queer, and the room was going to erupt 
[00:43:30]  with laughter.  Troy Aikman's a queer.  But there's no difference in our country between telling a joke that doesn't work and true  hate speech.  That's how fucking stupid we are as a country.  Same category as somebody that would prowl the streets at night looking for a gay couple  and punching them about the head, neck, and chest.  Right.  We should be able to know the difference.  Even though he apologized right after, and it was like, you know, that's how ballplayers,  and he released an apology after to Troy.  And I'm sure, you know, if Troy Aikman, if he asked him, he'd go, all right, fuck it. 
[00:44:00]  He said he was sorry, let it go.  But he signed his contract with an X.  That's great.  The apology is repulsive.  He played for 11 years.  After failing a fourth drug test, he was permanently banned from the NFL, and then revealed he was  a functional illiterate, despite having studied at Oklahoma State for four years.  Ha ha ha!  Oh, boy.  Ah, that doesn't bode well.  And now he's going on the radio and calling people queers. 
[00:44:30]  Queer.  And everybody's upset.  And he's laughing.  He's queer.  Yeah, he loved it.  The ho, ho, hey!  Watch out.  And he goes, do you want to apologize?  And there's a pause.  So he thinks about it, and he goes, no.  No.  I'll take it.  You know what?  We've got to hear it again.  Fuck it.  It's too good.  Let's hope that they'll recover on Sunday when they play against the Chargers.  Maybe it was an AFC team or something.  I'm hoping that they can redeem themselves come Sunday.  Wasn't a big jinx that Troy Aikman was doing the game, the former cowboy? 
[00:45:00]  I think Troy Aikman's a queer.  Hello.  Hell.  We don't want to go there.  Okay.  I'm sorry about that.  Now, do you want to apologize to him?  No.  You don't?  I'll just say I'll take that back.  Okay.  Since he's a cowboy fan.  Right.  Well, we don't want certainly anyone to think that anybody endorses anything like that,  Dexter.  Because that is, you know, really not an area that we want to go into.  Okay.  I apologize.  Dexter, always good to see you.  Thank you.  Thanks for coming in.  Get out.  It's so cartoonist that it should be okay. 
[00:45:30]  Hey.  He's probably like the show's Bobo.  Like, it's a sports show, so they have to have a football player on, but he's also an  idiot.  He's just not an idiot.  All right.  Let's say hi to John.  John.  Hi, Chad.  What do you got, buddy?  Hey, Chad.  Well, I'm, I just saw Washington Redskins changing their name deal.  Yep.  I believe that Daniel Snyder is such a piece of shit that he's, he doesn't give a shit  if it's Washington turd holders or whatever.  I don't think that's going to be the name. 
[00:46:00]  Well, no, I probably won't be.  But, so he's got to put up a big shit stink about everything.  And then when he, oh, I guess we'll change it.  He's going to think of all that merchandise that he gets to resell to all the people that  like the Washington Redskins.  You're right.  But with the name, this is a big one for the fans because you're right about merch.  But, dude, this is a, this is a name that's been there for so many years.  This is one that even though you'll make merch money, he doesn't want to lose the Redskins.  It's one of, it's one of those fucking, you know, it's just one of those ingrained football 
[00:46:30]  names like the Cowboys.  Yeah.  Like, he doesn't want to lose that name.  Sad that it's going to happen.  I get it.  All right, John.  Thank you.  But, you know, the satisfying part for me to see it change is simply because this is  the climate that people have allowed to take place.  Yeah.  Like, what happens is, this is a big noticeable one.  But all these years, when guys were getting in trouble and guys were getting scolded,  no one stood up.  Like, nobody out there.  People would be like, ah, ah. 
[00:47:00]  And then slowly they fucking creeped up on you and they creeped up on you and you can't  say this and you can't say that and you can't say this.  And now that it's one of your teams, all of a sudden people are,  whoa, what the fuck?  Where the fuck were you five years ago with your outrage and your letters?  Where was that?  Yeah.  You brought this on yourself.  You asked for it by saying nothing.  Yeah.  I just don't, I don't feel like when they came up with the Redskins that they were trying  to get away with some kind of slur.  Probably not.  You're right.  No.  They weren't.  I think it is.  From the beginning, they really thought that the name Redskins was a very positive thing. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  Especially for their football team.  Yeah, you're right.  I never felt like they were, oh, look what we got past everybody.  Yeah.  It's annoying.  It's annoying to live in this world like this with this bullshit.  But the way they reacted to queer.  Look at how they reacted to queer.  Oh, boy, did they freak out.  It's too arbitrary.  It's like you're either going to let people tell jokes and be the, or you're not.  It's fucking just arbitrary.  And the outrage is here one day.  It's a whack-a-mole.  Good, good.  Okay, no, you can pop your head up here and say that. 
[00:48:00]  That's fine.  The next day, dead.  There's no way to gauge it.  We lost that one a while ago.  It's the same fucking thing.  You might as well take a brick and go find, you know, you've got to be careful.  Someone on the street, because it's the same thing that will happen to you.  You'll get crucified for either, you know, saying the word in joke form or actually doing  something to somebody that might be that.  There's no context anymore.  No, it's not.  It's just whatever it is.  It's like everything you say is written down on a transcript with no sarcasm or humor 
[00:48:30]  to it or anything.  They just take it literally and verbatim and hang you with it.  No difference between gay bashing and hate speech and just telling a little joke on the  air and then go, oh, sorry.  No joke.  Humor.  Let's go to Sean in Texas.  We've got more on Dexter Manley.  Sean.  Morning, fellas.  Yeah.  Poor Mr. Manley.  You know, he played 11 years in the NFL, and I'm certainly not busting his balls.  But I walked into a furniture store here in North Houston a couple years ago, and he 
[00:49:00]  was trying to sell me a couch and a loveseat.  He was in there, you know, busting his shop, selling furniture.  So he had nothing after 11 years.  Yikes.  All his money was gone.  He wasn't, and come to find out, he wasn't smart enough to manage and didn't have the  tools to manage.  Poor guy selling furniture and recliners.  Oh.  And then he had a nice little radio gig.  Now that's...  Now, yeah, yeah.  He can't even be on the radio anymore.  He sounded entertaining as all hell with that.  Everyone's petrified of having him on. 
[00:49:30]  He might say, Troikman's a queer.  Troikman.  Troikman.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Let's get Dexter Manley on the phone.  Crazy.  Let's say hi to this guy.  Who's this guy?  Yellow.  I don't know your name, brother.  It's not on the phone screen.  I'm talking to you.  Hello, brother.  Do you hear my voice?  Yeah, you.  What's up?  Oh, boy.  Hello.  Everyone say hi right now.  Sorry.  I had you on speakerphone. 
[00:50:00]  Okay, buddy.  Of course.  You have Dexter Manley's phone numbers.  Yeah.  He did a benefit for...  Mr. Kite.  ...for my football team.  And I got his number on my phone.  All right.  Hold on a line.  Maybe we'll get Dexter Manley on.  Take that guy's number, call it, and see if it's Dexter Manley.  Yeah, if you sell him furniture, we should see if we can get him a job.  Yeah, right.  See if he wants to come on our show.  Hire him here.  Right.  Sell some furniture.  All right.  What do we got today?  Oh, Mike Baker's coming in.  I saw his show. 
[00:50:30]  Yes, on JFK.  He's part of America Declassified, which is on the Travel Channel.  And we're looking at 50 years since the JFK assassination.  50 years.  So he went down there to Dallas, Texas.  Oh.  And conducted a couple experiments.  I like a good JFK experiment.  He truly believes that it's a conspiracy.  He does?  Yep.  And Mike's a smart, analytical guy.  I'd be very interested to hear what he says, because he may have a good way of looking 
[00:51:00]  at it.  He's not a dumb guy at all.  He's a very bright guy.  And he could probably kill somebody with, like, one finger.  No, I don't think so.  You don't think so?  No.  He's too nice a guy.  Yeah?  Probably shoots you.  I bet he's got, like, that dark side.  Yeah, those are the guys you've got to worry about.  Maybe.  Some covert shit where he's just snapping necks.  Are you saying I just know happy fucking Fox News Mike?  And I don't know the real Mike?  Yes, exactly.  One twist that just comes up behind someone and just does that thing where you put your hand  on the back of their head and their forehead.  And you go, wha!  He just snapped their neck. 
[00:51:30]  He drops them slow.  Puts them on the ground.  Not even looking at them.  He's back to looking forward.  And then back ahead.  Right.  For the next guy.  That's Mike.  He got access to the railroad watchtower down there.  Oh!  And I don't think anyone has ever had access to that.  As far as, like, people in the media and stuff.  Off limits.  Because one of the witnesses swore they saw smoke from the grassy knoll.  Hmm.  As in, you know, someone firing and then you get the smoke.  So he did that experiment and he was able to go to the watchtower to see if the guy could 
[00:52:00]  have possibly seen the smoke from the grassy knoll.  So.  He believes conspiracy.  And I know Jim Norton, from our many conversations about this, the Kennedy assassination, has come  back around.  Who?  Bugliosi?  That was the big part of it.  The Bugliosi book?  There was other things I read online which helped.  And a lot of the photographic.  Little weird things.  The conspiracy theorists said, like, hey, that little, is that a figure inside the grassy 
[00:52:30]  knoll black dog man?  Yeah.  All these weird little names.  And the conspiracy theorists know who I mean.  with the umbrella man and all these things that did have explanations.  Or when you hear somebody go, those tramps, the three tramps they arrested, they never  identified them.  They absolutely have identified them.  A lot of people get their history from the movie JFK, which had a lot of fantasy.  That's what bugs me.  When I hear people quoting things that I know for a fact are nonsense, you know, Oswald  was a terrible shot. 
[00:53:00]  They told him to stand down.  He wasn't a terrible shot.  He was a sharpshooter.  Like, these fucking, that's when I know that they're just believing a quick thing that they  heard.  Yeah.  But hey, look, I'll be interested to hear, you know, I'm not married to the idea that  it was just Oswald.  I don't give a fuck.  If it was a conspiracy, I'd be more than happy to come around back again and go, you know  what, it was a conspiracy.  Yeah.  I just, I'm sorry, the conspiracy theorists have proven themselves too irrational to me.  Jim is wishy-washy. 
[00:53:30]  Yes, when it comes to that, I wasn't there, so I'm willing to listen to both sides.  How many witnesses died in an untimely manner?  Not many.  And that was something, because that's one of those things people bring up and they  go, the odds of that, the odds of it is so ridiculous and off the charts that that's  what makes people go, you know, go, oh, wait, I got to raise my eyebrows.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe some of them, but not what they said.  And again, Bugliosi addressed that in his book, and it was just, just more paranoid  fucking nonsense.  What do you say about that?  That they just, it wasn't true. 
[00:54:00]  Like, I forget, it's been a couple of years since I read the book.  I should probably go over it again since I talk about this shit all the time.  It's a fucking 1200 page book.  Oof.  That he hand wrote.  Oh, that's rough.  He doesn't type.  Oh, wow.  That's a lot of work.  And they type.  It's brilliantly cross-referenced, and he goes over every conspiracy theory.  Wow.  200 pages, though?  Yeah, it's a long one.  But I mean, it's so many.  You can't do that shit in 200 pages?  Thank you for your service.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We also have Aziz here. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, Aziz is coming in today.  He has a special coming out on Netflix.  Tariq?  Tariq Aziz.  Oh.  He's the information minister of Iraq.  Information minister of Iraq.  Not to be confused with Baghdad Bob.  Good old Baghdad Bob.  Still one of my favorite people in a war ever.  Yep.  Everything is okay.  His bombs are going off behind the guy.  Yes, the Americans did come to the airport, but we pushed them back, and we are in control 
[00:55:00]  of the airport.  You know, behind him, you're just seeing C-130s fucking conga lining into Baghdad.  People screaming, running across the screen.  That guy was a hoot.  He was awesome.  I think I still have a coffee mug with his picture on it.  Really?  Yeah, I had to have a little memorabilia from Baghdad Bob.  Also, Jimmy Kimmel had a little trouble.  What did he do?  We're going to tell the people next.  Oh, a little teaser-rooney. 
[00:55:30]  And then we'll get an update on our favorite person, Jay-Z.  Oh, Jay-Z.  Is he still on the hell nah stage?  Jay-Z, Barneys, now you're partnered with them.  You're making a lot of money.  Are you thinking about withdrawing your relationship from them due to racial allegations that they're  Oh, Hannah!  Is there anyone there?  Go.  After these messages, the O.P. and Anthony Show will be right back. 
[00:56:00]  And now, back to The O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Let's go surfing now.  Everybody's learning how.  Come on, I'm a safari with me.  Come on, I'm a safari with me.  Early in the morning, we'll be starting now.  Money will be coming along.  Not a big fan.  Sorry.  Thumbs down for the Opster.  Beach Boys?  Yeah, not a huge Beach Boys fan. 
[00:56:30]  There's a couple I like.  They're okay.  This song is 51 years old today.  Surf and Safari was their debut album, I believe.  Let's go surfing now.  Everybody's learning how.  What year was this?  53?  51 years ago.  So, what would that be?  62-ish?  Oh, 62.  I didn't love them either.  What was your wedding song that was actually really good?  God Only Knows.  That's a good song.  I like that one a lot.  Can we get that, Eric?  I like that.  In general, I'm not a huge...  I'm tearing up. 
[00:57:00]  I'm not going to tear up when I look at you and hear this song.  You might.  No.  Oh, that's a good song.  Reminds me of Boogie Nights.  Paul McCartney called this the best song of all time.  Did he?  No.  Really?  Oh, he doesn't know shit.  Does Paul know?  This is the end of kind of a Boogie Nights where they're all kind of showing what they're  doing after their turmoil.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  It's one of the few songs that the use of jingle bells doesn't make you think of Christmas.  Ah. 
[00:57:30]  There's a lot of jingle songs.  Yeah?  Using the jingle bells.  Like this?  Yeah.  A lot of...  Ching, ching, ching.  God only knows what I'd be without you.  Yeah, good, good, good.  Do, do, do, do, do.  If you should ever leave me.  Ah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, it's great to hear a taste, Eric.  What, are you fucking going on vacation now?  He's in mourning.  What?  What?  What, sweetie?  Leave Eric alone.  He's in mourning.  Lovey, what's the matter? 
[00:58:00]  He lost a Simpson character.  He's so upset about Edna?  Oh, he's absolutely upset about it.  How'd you lose it?  Eric.  Well, she died, so he's like...  Oh!  He's in mourning.  Oh, he cares.  No, he cares.  He'll tell you.  She only did the one voice.  Really?  I do the voice.  I do the voice.  I do the voice.  Do you?  I do the voice.  Holy shit. 
[00:58:30]  Wasn't she also the receptionist on Bob Newhart?  Yes.  Yeah, that's how we know her.  Yeah, that's how, like, real people.  Real cute, adult human beings know her.  That's how old people know her.  Oh!  Whoa!  Wow.  Point and angle.  Exactly.  Counterpoint.  Because the Simpsons hasn't been on for 30 fucking years.  Exactly.  That's a really old show now.  Come on.  How many years officially?  We're in the 26th season.  Holy shit, really?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What else can they do with a cartoon?  Longest running, non-scripted, prime-time show, I think, right? 
[00:59:00]  Does it still happen?  Or scripted.  Excuse me, non-scripted.  I can't believe people still watch new episodes of it.  I can't imagine.  Are the new episodes good?  Not, like, the first 10 years, no.  But they've gotten better from 10 years ago.  Is it on TV still?  Yeah.  You know, I've never heard anyone talk about it.  No, I've seen the reruns, but new episodes are on TV still, huh?  No one talks about it.  It's not like a web show?  No one says, did you see the Simpsons last night?  Well, you used to sit down in front of your TV on a Sunday after football and watch a 
[00:59:30]  little Simpsons.  Oh, yeah.  I don't feel like people are doing that anymore.  No.  But it's just there.  But it's so, it's one of those things that they'll probably never get rid of.  It's too, too, what am I saying?  Iconic.  Iconic.  Yeah, I just lost interest.  I know, it's like, I can't get up for a Simpsons discussion.  Man, I heard E-Roc's, like, giving away part of his fucking toy collection.  I heard that on Sam's show yesterday.  What's wrong with my scoops? 
[01:00:00]  What's going on?  A lot of scoops on the Sam Roberts show.  I'm just focusing on certain things, and I have too many toys that are from too many  lines, so I'm just going to start getting rid of a lot of it.  What happened at home?  Yeah, exactly.  Believe me, this is not a voluntary.  Oh, no way.  No, it is.  No.  It is.  No.  It is.  What are you, growing up?  No.  I'm just focusing on certain toys, rather than everything.  He's running out of a room.  Why would you, why not just keep them, put them in a box somewhere?  Do you have to get a baby room together?  Is that what's going on here?  Oh, shit. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, shit.  Congratulations, E-Roc's got his wife right to have it in baby.  Congratulations.  Because I used to have a room that had all my stuff in it, and then, you know, I had  to box that shit up and make a baby room.  Yeah, why don't you just box it up and put it in the attic?  Yeah.  It's already boxed up in the basement.  Well, then why are you getting rid of it?  Because there's too much.  He keeps buying more.  Don't fight him.  He's trying to be a real person, and we're encouraging him to keep his hoard.  I just don't believe his sincerity in getting rid of these toys.  I feel like there's something else going on. 
[01:01:00]  That's it.  Two lines.  Yeah.  He's getting rid of Transformers.  He-Man.  Voltron.  Oh, God.  He-Man.  He-Man.  He-Man.  He-Man's the worst.  He-Man.  That cartoon sucked fucking balls.  Do you have He-Man toys?  Yes, I do.  Animation was so bad.  It was.  It was horrible.  Filmation.  Some of his terrible company.  Some of his were children when the show came on.  Doesn't matter.  I was a child when I watched cartoons, and it was done artistically.  Amazing.  That's right.  Composed music just for the cartoon. 
[01:01:30]  Fucking.  Not just the cell of the fucking mouth moving over a matte fucking drawing.  It was art.  But you had to go to theaters to see them.  No.  No.  It was on the television.  They weren't part of the newsreel?  Not part of the newsreel.  They might have been when they first came out.  Flintstones' house was very realistic when they ran across the entire house.  Flintstones' animation wasn't that good either.  That's for sure.  Hey, Bonnie.  Shut up.  I love the Flintstones. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, Bob.  Hey, Fred.  I'd watch the Flintstones over the Simpsons any day.  I liked the Flintstones.  And now, you asshole, and I'm pointing at you.  Oh, no.  I can't watch Family Guy anymore because of your fucking take on it.  I don't fucking stand that goddamn show.  Reminds me of that time.  That reminds me of the time I was in the Foreign Legion.  All right.  There it is.  Now go to the D.  There he is.  Oh, okay.  Ha, ha, ha.  Now he's back again.  And then they come back for 30 seconds. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, 30 seconds.  It reminds me of their time.  That's like when I was giving a speech at Nuremberg.  I think it's overused.  It's fucking angering watching that godly fuckwad show.  My young son is a big fan of the Family Guy, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, he likes Family Guy.  Oh.  That's why I've been watching a lot.  But your observation kills it for me.  It's like that time I was walking on the moon with Neil Armstrong, really? 
[01:03:00]  There he is.  Peter in a big, fat space suit.  It's always...  It's just...  The entire show.  Reminds me of that time.  Reminds me of the time.  Wow.  Right.  Wow.  Does it?  I can't stand it.  Is there anything you like these days?  I'm getting confused.  Really, I've been reading a lot of tweets from people that are very concerned that I don't  like anything.  I know I don't like a lot of stuff. 
[01:03:30]  I just voice what I don't like.  Are you looking for new cartoons to watch?  What would you suggest?  Any suggestions?  I would suggest Archer on FX.  Archer on FX.  What's Archer?  I saw some promos for that.  It did seem kind of funny.  The Top Gun trailer that they did?  Yeah, yeah.  It looks kind of funny.  Very funny show.  Very risque.  But I like live action stuff these days.  I'm digging a good live action, well acted, you know, kind of real adult movie. 
[01:04:00]  Like a person.  I don't watch adult cartoons.  Why?  It's no interest.  Because he's not happy.  That's not true.  Oh, shit.  You can't enjoy your rock firing back.  No, but that's not true.  I am, and I enjoy good fucking...  Adult cartoons are great.  No, they do nothing for me.  Maybe it's because they annoy me too much on principle because I know  they're getting away with more than real people can, and that just makes me...  It's not their fault.  Yeah, that's true.  But I never really got into them. 
[01:04:30]  I was a big fan of Robot Chicken.  Are they making new episodes?  Yes, they are.  Yeah.  I like Robot Chicken.  I'm going to have to delve back into that shit.  Yeah, it might be great.  Quick and easy.  Pop culture.  Gets a beating.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  I've probably seen two full episodes of The Simpsons in my life.  I've never seen a fucking episode of Family Guy.  And it's not because they're terrible.  It just annoys me too much that people can't say shit anymore, and the cartoons can't work.  Eric, you watch Adventure Time?  I haven't in a while.  It reminds me of when I was on the Hindenburg. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, look.  He's still at it.  Look, he's fucking jumping out.  It's on fire.  We did this already.  It's okay.  I can't fucking handle it.  To be fair, they have acknowledged it in this past season.  I saw it.  I think because they finally heard everyone bitching about it.  I saw the episode because he goes, that reminds me of the time, and it's some ridiculous thing.  And then he goes, can we have a clip?  Right.  No clip.  There's an episode where a couple of the characters go back in time to the pilot episode,  and they're watching stuff goes on, and they're watching the family in the kitchen, 
[01:05:30]  and they'll say something, and then they just stand there, and nothing's happening.  And the other two characters go, what the hell are they doing?  What's wrong?  And they're like, oh, wait.  How many damn cut scenes did we have in this episode?  Okay.  And then they do an episode of just all cut scenes.  Well, acknowledging it doesn't mean that, you know.  No, it doesn't mean it's going to stop it.  It doesn't suck.  But at least they're just letting you know, okay, we get it.  I hate it.  Look, I can accept the fact we're not going to have flying cars.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  But can we figure out a fucking plastic spoon that doesn't cut the shit out of the side of your mouth?  Ah, you could put a man on the moon.  How are you hurting yourself with the spoon?  I'm having the same spoon.  Are you kidding?  Zipping around in here, eating, laughing.  Why does it have to have a razor blade edge?  That reminds me of when I worked at the plastic spoon factory.  Why?  They don't do a good job deflashing the plastic after it pops out of the mold.  No, probably because it's too much time and money. 
[01:06:30]  They need to throw those in a big dryer thing with some sand or something and sandblast them.  Cut the side of my fucking mouth with this thing.  Gem alert.  Kenny just walked up to the mic.  Jimmy's calling a gem alert.  Is this brand of oatmeal acceptable as opposed to the other brand?  It's a little better than the Starbucks, though.  I hate it.  I'm bringing in my own oatmeal starting tomorrow.  Kashi?  No.  I don't do the Kashi as well. 
[01:07:00]  I swear to God, those are the most unhealthy, ugly people in Kashi commercials.  Yeah.  There's not one attractive person in those commercials.  It's some girl.  She's walking through the jungle looking for some leaf to put in the cereal.  And she's a fucking dog.  She's shaking from the lack of protein.  Of course.  Fucking translucent skin.  She's never in the sun.  Right.  But she's going to find that unique berry for her next cereal.  Great.  I find unique flavors for Kashi. 
[01:07:30]  She's got the natural graying hair coming in.  Color that shit.  You know what?  Ah.  I'm usually with you on that.  Yeah.  The other day, walking the streets of Manhattan, there was a woman that walked by with natural  gray hair.  Yeah.  Looked good.  Wow.  Yeah.  Really?  I was surprised.  Was it long?  It was, yeah.  Yeah.  Not like...  Was it lustrous?  Yeah.  It was full and it was gray and it was like...  Yeah.  It worked.  I want to say yes, that it's working on you.  Could you run your fingers through it?  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  I was surprised because usually I'm with you.  Yeah?  You know, dye that shit.  Hmm.  Was she old?  Um, I was trying to figure that out.  Probably, uh, no.  Probably, I mean, old for you.  Yes.  Yeah.  Very old for you.  But I would say probably, uh, if I had to guess, like mid-40s.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's not, you know, that's nice.  I don't care.  There was a little bit of a turn on.  Yeah.  A little bit.  I don't know.  Nah, it wouldn't turn me on. 
[01:08:30]  No.  I could live with it, but it wouldn't turn me on.  I ain't, no.  There was something about it.  It always reminds me of some fucking country naturalist woman thing.  You're not a fan of that?  That long, gray hair.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she cares for horses.  Where she's working her garden?  Yeah, shit like that.  She's gardening.  Working the public garden?  She has her gardening board that she puts out to kneel on.  It's got the little holes for her little spade shovel and that little claw thing.  Nothing better.  Gardening.  Nothing better than driving through a neighborhood and seeing a big fat pear ass bent over working 
[01:09:00]  on the garden.  Bent over gardening.  I love those commercials where it's like for health care or some shit and some old woman's  gardening and the husband is talking to her like he gives a fuck about a dumb plants.  That doesn't happen.  I don't understand gardening.  I don't either.  People really...  Hobby.  They really get into it.  It's something you have to do if you need to do it.  Horrible.  You know, oh, we need some vegetation in front of the window here. 
[01:09:30]  We used to have to pull weeds out from around our house.  I hated it.  There was no fun in it.  People with empty nest syndrome, I think.  A lot of older people.  Oh, is that it?  Not that their fucking womb has a for sale sign on it.  They're out there like, I want something to grow and feel like I'm giving some kind of  life.  Oh, yes.  And what?  They notice what's growing overnight.  They're like, oh, we got some new stuff growing over here.  Don't care for it.  Talk to it.  Love it.  Nurturing something.  Raising it.  Yuck.  You're right, Jimmy.  Sprinkle some water on it.  Give it care and it will love you back and nourish you. 
[01:10:00]  Walk in on it while it's masturbating.  Yes.  Those tomatoes won't overdose.  This rhododendron won't come home with a Negro.  Exactly.  Yeah, this cucumber is not going to go into this zucchini and disgrace the family.  Or I should say the tomatoes won't be spoiled by the eggplant.  Yes, exactly. 
[01:10:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't get that gardening thing either.  Let's do the Kimmel thing.  By the way, I saw them protesting outside our gym because it's across from ABC.  I'm like, what the fuck is all those?  And it was that.  The Chinaman?  Yep.  That's what it was.  Chinese people are mad?  Wow.  Yeah.  You know, the Dalai Lama was staying at the Beacon Hotel the other day.  I waited outside with all the, you know, the chinis.  Yeah.  I waited outside there for about an hour with my young son waiting for the Dalai Lama to exit. 
[01:11:00]  They were all waiting for him just to exit and get in a car.  Yeah, just so they could get a picture of him or something.  Maybe a little blessing or something.  Tibet.  Did you see him?  No.  Why?  I had to give up.  You could only spend so much time waiting for the Dalai Lama.  Well, he did three days at the Beacon.  Dalai Lama.  Is that what that was?  Three days he was there, yeah.  Yeah.  What does he do?  Probably gives a talk or whatever, you know.  Does he do any covers?  Big hitter to Lama.  That shit got a laugh.  Come on, Beacon Theater covers. 
[01:11:30]  I know, that's true.  All right.  That's true.  But what does he do, really?  He just talks?  Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know.  He prays?  He talks.  He probably, yeah, yeah.  He spreads his fucking whatever it is that he spreads.  Oh, and it made me think of something.  The Dalai Lama?  You know how we talk about the Dalai Lama in the elevator in Atlanta?  Uh-huh.  I need to know this from you right now.  Yeah.  That actually happened, right?  Yes, it did.  What?  Because so much time has gone by.  I'm like, did that actually happen?  No, we were in the elevator with the Dalai Lama.  We were, right? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, you were?  Yeah.  But it was one of those things, my mind's starting to go, there's no way you were in  an elevator with the Dalai Lama.  So I go, because after waiting for the Dalai Lama, I go, I gotta ask Anne if that actually  happened, because now I'm not sure anymore.  Did that really happen?  Yeah.  You know, because we pump up some of our shit a little bit to make it a little better for  the radio, but we were in an elevator with the Dalai Lama in Atlanta, and we didn't  give a fuck, remember?  It was exactly a week after we-  Got fired.  Took a blimp, and threw bra bombs. 
[01:12:30]  It was one of those things, I'm like, we were, and we didn't care.  Did you say, I don't remember?  We were staying at the Ritz Carlton in Atlanta, we were down there for an interview, and he  had the whole top floor, I guess, and somehow me and Anthony, the Dalai Lama, and one of  the security guys were, that happened, right?  Flowing robes, grace, bald, striking.  The Dalai Lama stays in the Ritz.  Yeah, yeah.  Why didn't we take a picture or anything?  Well, I don't think we had a camera.  It was back in those days. 
[01:13:00]  Where you just didn't have one on.  Hey, you don't have a camera.  Everyone needed a camera.  You gotta carry one around with you.  Crazy.  Just in case something was gonna go down.  And you only carried a camera around to special events.  Right.  The only people that actually carried a camera all the time were like, you know, freelance  news photographers.  So a lot of shit happened that you just missed.  Now, you get to see what people are having for fucking lunch.  Real productive.  It's amazing how many miraculous things just turn into like, commonplace. 
[01:13:30]  People were all in with their social networking, and I'm noticing people are dropping off.  Are they?  They're realizing they're...  Waiting for the next big thing?  No, they just don't have enough shit to put out there.  Oh.  Because they, you know, they did their, uh, their, the pictures of their lunches.  You haven't noticed?  Especially on Facebook.  Yeah.  People started dropping out.  They're dropping out with the, the posting their lunch pictures.  They're just dropping out in general.  I was, uh, I was thinking of, um, the miracle that was the laser beam. 
[01:14:00]  Many, many years ago, uh, getting a, a beam of light to laze was amazing.  Now, you use it so your cat can fucking run around the house like a lunatic.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  It was a miraculous thing.  It took a fucking room of, of, of, uh, equipment to get a laser light.  Like, now you pick up a little fucking thing and you use it to, you know, drive your cat 
[01:14:30]  nuts.  It's just astounding where we've come as, uh...  Technology.  It's amazing, right?  Technology.  Did you do a Seinfeld reference in there?  No, no, I swear.  Nope.  Not, not that one on before.  Oh, uh, it was just a line, I guess.  Which one?  Which one was it?  Oh, oh, the hair.  The hair.  Oh.  Is it lustrous?  Oh.  Can you run your fingers through it?  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh, so, so Jimmy Kimmel, I didn't know they were protesting.  Wow. 
[01:15:00]  So this is becoming a little bit of a thing, huh?  Uh, I don't even know what he did.  It was, it's one of the...  You mean he's watched Kimmel, though?  No, it was one of those things where it's a fake outrage thing.  It was a funny bit, and, uh, you know, it's just another, again, more special interest  garbage, so the network, of course, buckles and takes the dick and apologizes, and then  people wonder why the Redskins' name is going to be changed.  It's fucking amazing.  Enough groveling people.  Yeah, can somebody, and I know there's money at stake, and it's easy for me to say, because 
[01:15:30]  I don't run the network, and they're like, we don't just say you're sorry and protect  the advertisers and make their money.  Again, I understand that business makes sense, but all of the people who don't work for  the network, if you're not going to push back against this politically correct fucking  wall that's falling down on you, just don't fucking snivel when it breaks and crushes something  that you like, because you're sitting there, you're bigger than the networks.  All the people out there, the consumers, if you flooded the calls with network, uh, the 
[01:16:00]  networks with support for Jimmy Kimmel, um, and if you flooded them with support and  said, we're not going to watch you if you buckle...  It doesn't work that way.  No, of course not.  We have an apathetic nation.  Exactly.  It doesn't, uh, it never works that way.  It never works that way.  People just turn the show on, enjoy it, but they're not willing to call and fucking...  But they'll cry when it's gone.  ...support him.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's just it.  How people are willing to not speak out against this political correct bullshit when everyone  is threatened by it. 
[01:16:30]  Yep.  You, you can slip up at work and lose your fucking job.  That's hanging over your head.  Forget about, are you doing your job?  Are you doing it properly?  Did you make a mistake at work?  You know, say, are you late to work every day?  Fuck all that shit.  That used to be how you used to lose your fucking job.  Now, did you say something?  Did you bring something in?  Did you hang something in your cubicle that offended another co-worker?  You know, that now is the way you lose your fucking job.  It's, uh...  It's disgusting. 
[01:17:00]  It's pathetic.  And for people that, um, that don't speak out against this and embrace it, you're an idiot.  Because you're next, you know?  You're down the line at some point.  But people are scared to speak out because then it might mean their job.  I know.  That's why you need brave people like me!  Well, we got the FU money.  Oh.  We were always brave, though.  We were...  We're stupid.  Brave.  Probably stupid.  Courageous and stupid.  Yes.  I think we're just stupid.  Maybe we weren't brave.  Uh, so, Jimmy Kimmel has a terrific bid. 
[01:17:30]  It's a kid's table.  They're talking about some issues.  Hmm.  Of the day.  The creative stuff they do at this show, man.  Yeah.  These are very funny, creative bits.  Really funny.  Uh, and, uh...  Do we have the video or we just go to this?  Yeah, I can get through.  Let's go to the video.  How about this?  Get the video for the boss.  I already said yes.  I know, but you don't...  He's too nice about it.  Damn.  And Mike Baker's coming in in a few minutes.  Yeah.  And Aziz.  What's he a candlestick maker?  Yeah.  That doesn't make sense.  Bucket does so!  Right.  It doesn't. 
[01:18:00]  Oh.  You know, all throughout this government shutdown, people kept saying...  Do you want me to play the whole thing or just the part that matters?  I don't know.  How's the whole bit?  It's a funny bit, but...  Nice.  Let's do it.  How long is it?  How long is it?  It's, uh...  About four minutes.  That's terrific.  That's fine.  Let's go through it.  Righto.  I like it.  We just gained three minutes.  Nice.  Keep it track at home.  We had a minute clip.  Now we're playing a four-minute clip.  I'm going to enjoy some oatmeal.  Comment on it.  Yeah, you know.  We'll stop it a couple times. 
[01:18:30]  I bet you will.  I'm saying Congress was acting like a bunch of kids.  Some congressmen even said they finally brought the adults in the room to settle this today.  So I thought it would be interesting to ask a group of actual children for their opinions on this subject.  And so I did.  Here now is the first installment of our hard-hitting news discussion panel.  We call it...  It's a Chinese feed.  That's from a Chinese show.  Yeah.  It's not part of the bit.  Right.  It's table. 
[01:19:00]  Welcome to Kids Table.  I'm your host, Jimmy Kimmel.  This is our table.  These are our kids.  Today's topic...  Politics.  What are politics?  It's kind...  The politics are kind of like Barack Obama, the government...  Oh.  And what is the president's name?  President Obama.  Barack Obama.  Barack Obama.  Barack Obama.  Barack Obama.  Barack Obama.  How do you spell Barack?  M-R-A-Y-A-Y-Y-K-H-E-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K. 
[01:19:30]  I hope it's not.  P-A-Y-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K.  Barack Obama.  No.  G-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K-I-K.  Okay.  Let's move on from that.  You pause real quick.  Again.  And this this is the mentality of people.  letters underneath being  subtitled for those who can't 
[01:20:00]  understand the language. So they want  you to be offended at something that somebody  said on a show you  don't watch in a language you don't understand.  There you go. Right. That's for people  who couldn't understand it. And yet, meanwhile,  they hear people laughing.  How about this, all you fucking  Chinese people or whatever kind of people are offended  at this. How about you be offended at  the way the Chinese government treats its  citizens? There you go. How about  standing outside of fucking ABC  protesting a dumb joke with  your fucking stupid sensitivity? 
[01:20:30]  How about you stand outside the Chinese  embassy and protest the  way China treats some of its citizens?  How about you protest our own government  for doing business with such a despicable  nation as China? Absolutely.  Yes. Absolutely.  This guy tells a dumb, and it's a funny joke  and it's funny because a kid said it and it's obviously  not a real thing. Well,  I'm still waiting for him to say something.  Yeah. Funny.  Yeah, actually.  Just kids fucking babbling.  God.  Yeah, they always do. 
[01:21:00]  Um, basically  it is the government shut down  the parks  in which  we need them to open it up  because parks should be  alone.  Raiden, you?  What do you think?  The government shut down is when the  president  they shut down parks  and people who work for the government.  That's exactly right, Raiden.  Why do you think this is happening?  I don't know.  Braxton, you?  The government just step it up  and stop being a little crybaby 
[01:21:30]  to make up their mind.  What do you think of that, guys?  Yes.  Awesome.  Okay, next question.  America owes China a lot of money.  1.3 trillion dollars.  How should we pay them back?  To pay them all the way over  and kill everyone in China.  Kill everyone in China?  Yes.  Okay, that's an interesting idea.  Yes.  Put a huge wall  so they can't come to us.  You're saying build a wall in China  is a huge, great kind of a wall? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  That would never happen.  A huge wall.  Allie,  when you owe someone money,  should you pay them back?  Never.  Well, then they won't lend you money anymore.  Oh, and that's the problem.  Should this country  be forced to pay our own debts?  Yes.  Yeah, but you just said  kill everyone in China a little while ago.  What happened to that?  Should we allow the Chinese to live?  Yes.  But if we don't allow them to live,  then they'll try to kill us. 
[01:22:30]  But then they will all be killed.  Yeah, they're going to be all be killed.  Oh, my God.  If we kill them, they won't pay us.  Well, this has been an interesting addition.  Do you see the context of that where it goes?  Fuck all those protesters  and fuck their outrage.  Oh, it makes me sick.  That, that's what they're...  Yeah.  See, I couldn't even tell  what the outrage is.  Yeah.  It's dumb kids' ideas  of what should happen.  Yeah.  And the joke is in the ludicrousness  of a child's thought process.  Right. 
[01:23:00]  And of the silliness  of what a child thinks the answer is.  Maybe they're protesting  because the kids aren't working.  Yeah.  They're protesting the girl.  Why wasn't she killed at birth?  That's what you ought to be  fucking crying about.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me ask you this.  Did Jimmy Kimmel write that line?  Oh, I don't know.  But even if he did...  It's a little suspicious.  Maybe.  That the kids might have  had a few lines they were fed.  Sure, maybe.  How did they have all their fingers  at that age?  They should have been ripped off  in some machine. 
[01:23:30]  Wow, okay.  I don't even see  any problem with that.  Nope.  Dumb kids saying dumb shit.  Whatever.  It's always been a bet, right?  And the Chinese are mad at what?  Kimmel.  In addition to the apology,  ABC said it would remove  the segment  from all future broadcasts  of the episode  and we'll scrub it  from any existing copies  currently available online.  Sure.  They just panicked. 
[01:24:00]  Take that Chinese dick  right in your ass.  Exactly.  And apologize  if it's a big  special interest group.  Nonsense.  Utter nonsense.  We would never  purposefully  broadcast  anything  to upset  the Chinese  community.  Asian community.  Anyone of  Chinese descent  or community  at large.  What a 
[01:24:30]  groveling  bunch of  dickwads.  What a groveling  country.  It's the whole country.  It really is.  We're a groveling  nation.  Every fucking day  it's one of these.  Every day.  Every day.  Remember,  it used to be one  every once in a while  and we would jump on it.  It's pretty much  every day now.  Every fucking day.  Jack Cafferty,  I love the fact  he would not  apologize for what  he said.  But again,  because he's on  a news channel,  that was okay.  Yeah,  but most of his  colleagues would  apologize.  Yeah,  probably.  Jack Cafferty is  his own man.  He always has been. 
[01:25:00]  He's a bit  ornery.  Dexter Manley,  too.  And fucking  Dexter Manley.  He doesn't give a  shit.  No.  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Clint Eastman is  queer.  That's what he  said.  He happens to  think that  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  Troy,  and he's  unapologetic  about it.  So,  that they'll  recover on  Sunday when  they play  against the  Chargers.  Maybe it was  the AFC  team or  something.  I'm hoping  that they  can redeem  themselves  come Sunday.  Wasn't it  a big jinx  that Troy  Aikman was  doing the  game,  the former  cowboy? 
[01:25:30]  I think  Troy  was a  queer.  Whoa,  whoa,  whoa,  whoa,  whoa,  I love  Dexter Manley.  I think Troichman's a queer.  I guess it was a dead end with his phone numbers from earlier.  Yeah, they're trying.  Okay.  We should take a break.  Mike Baker's on his way in.  But we might have to squeeze some Jocktober in while Mike Baker talks about his new show.  Would like a little Jocktober.  Okay.  It's been a while.  Why don't we try to do that?  So we'll break here.  We'll do some Jocktober.  We'll do Mike Baker. 
[01:26:00]  We got Aziz coming in at 9 o'clock.  All right?  All right.  The OPNF show continues in moments.  And now these messages.  You guys are back.  Now back to our show.  The OPNF show.  All right.  All right, all right, all right.  Got Mike Baker outside the studio.  Yes, yes.  I saw his new show, America Declassified, and I liked it. 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  I absolutely liked it.  They take, like, three stories, right?  There's three every episode?  There's three.  Well, two or three.  Because I watched yours, I watched the second one, and I tapped out for the third.  Yeah.  It's not because it sucked.  I was just done with it because I was watching the show for you, and I liked it there, Mike Baker.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  You went down to Dallas to talk about the JFK thing.  We did.  And it, it, can I ask you the, sorry, before you went down to Dallas, what did you think 
[01:27:00]  about the JFK assassination?  Did you think it was a conspiracy?  Before you did your own research?  He knows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's working inside.  You know, the file, the outfit, the other angles.  I mean, honestly, a new medium called video.  Of course.  You know, when you go into training, that's actually the thing that people don't know.  The first, first week, they tell you all these things.  Right.  And they keep in line. 
[01:27:30]  Right.  I think that's like an old Bill Hicks bit or something, where they show you the basement  of the White House.  The new president.  Yeah.  I didn't have a real point of view one way or the other beforehand.  I mean, I felt as if, with a conspiracy, I understood why people wanted to think that  there was something there, or believed, or still believe that there's something there.  And the show itself, America Declassified, on Sundays on Travel Channel at 10 p.m.  Nice.  See how I do that now?  Yes.  Smooth. 
[01:28:00]  I think a week's worth of training for that.  And, but I understand why, you know, why there's this desire to have something bigger  than just one lone, you know, psychotic out there with a rifle.  Yeah, right.  And so what we try to do with the show, during the episodes when we're talking about a mystery  or a conspiracy, is to try to peel back the layers, and then let the viewers make a decision.  We're not trying to just say, this is it, this is the answer, because it would be asinine,  right?  Yeah, of course.  You've got 20 minutes for a story, perhaps.  And we're not going to, we're not going to solve everything. 
[01:28:30]  But we take aspects of the mystery, aspects of the conspiracy, we take the viewers behind  the scenes at restricted or top secret facilities where we get access.  Jesse Ventura did that.  Yeah, did he?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy, did he.  It was a little different, though, you know.  There's a name I haven't heard in ages.  I don't see, you know.  In ages, he's popping up again.  I don't see Mike Baker out there at fucking, you know, Roswell.  Right.  Talking about UFOs.  Oh, jeez.  No, I can guarantee the viewers that there will be no alien stories. 
[01:29:00]  No aliens.  No alien stories.  As much as the viewers may want them, we're staying away from them.  Jesse Ventura.  I think the whole conspiracy thing, I think people love conspiracies because they feel  powerless without them.  If you think of the Kennedy assassination, 9-11, things like that, if you just take it  at face value, we're very vulnerable.  Right.  Is a president that vulnerable where a lone gunman can, you know, screw up the course of  the country?  Well, back then, sure.  Yeah, right. 
[01:29:30]  Not anymore, because now we look at our president and he's very, very protected.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, there's layers you just don't even see.  But if history has taught us one thing.  Right.  So let's get into the JFK thing.  Sure.  Talk about that episode and what you did.  Well, it was fantastic.  We went down, we got the permission from the authorities.  We didn't just spring on them and surprise us.  You didn't get a lot of permission.  We didn't get a huge amount of permission.  And I'll tell you why.  We did.  Mike, I'll tell you why.  Why?  Why is that?  Because you couldn't stop the traffic. 
[01:30:00]  Well, no, we did stop traffic.  We did stop traffic.  We didn't stop pedestrian traffic.  There's one shot where I'm like, he's going to get hit by a car.  Oh, that one.  Yeah, that was okay.  Okay.  Fair enough.  All right, fair enough.  So you didn't get a lot of clearance.  We didn't lock the city down.  Yeah, you couldn't get a couple of cops to go, look, they're filming something for the  travel channel.  Mike Baker, ex-CIA, is on the X.  They have the famous X down there where you can stand on, and that's where JFK got his  head fucking blown off.  And you're doing a little quick look.  I'm just proving that I saw the show.  And you're doing a little thing on the X, and I see the cars coming, and I'm like, this is 
[01:30:30]  the travel channel.  They should have been able to stop the traffic for you.  And the funny thing was, they kept saying, okay, well, go back at that.  Let's do it one more time, but try it from this perspective.  And so we'd wait for the light to change.  I'm thinking, okay, it's very high end.  And you can see all the guys up at the traffic light thinking, I'm going to hit this motherfucker.  And to them, it's just another traffic light.  They live in that town.  They don't give a fuck about the JFK assassination.  They just want to get home.  So when that light turns green, because me and Jimmy witnessed this, they start flying  down that sort of, it's kind of a hill. 
[01:31:00]  A little bit of a hill right there.  Everybody's worried they're going to get popped if they speed through.  They don't want history to repeat itself.  And we saw, I forgot if it was a lady.  It was a woman, right?  We saw a woman almost get fucking crushed.  Because people assume, well, that's where JFK got shot.  It's an ex.  I'm a tourist.  Of course I could just go out there and get a picture.  They don't even notice that cars are coming.  Invincibility.  It's a working public road.  But we saw a lady almost get fucking, it was close, man. 
[01:31:30]  It's three lanes of traffic.  They're moving, like you said.  By the time they hit that little slope, yeah, they're flying.  Anyway, so you went down there.  So we went down there.  And if anybody hasn't been down to Dealey Plaza or hasn't been to the Book Depository Museum,  they should go because it's a fantastic experience.  So what we were looking at was kind of walking back through Lee Harvey Oswald's story, but  at the same time looking at the conspiracy from a couple of different perspectives.  And one witness in particular was quite compelling, a guy named Lee Bowers, who worked at the train 
[01:32:00]  station, he was a station master up in the switching tower, that is actually behind the  grassy knoll.  And his testimony was about the second gunman, about seeing a muzzle flash, seeing something  behind the picket fence that looks down over the grassy knoll onto the road.  And so we ran some forensic testing on that to see, just basic things, to see whether  Lee Bowers could have been credible.  Could he have seen what he thought he saw or what he claimed he saw?  Looking at his death, he died. 
[01:32:30]  Wait, wait, wait, before you move on to that, sorry.  You're downplaying it, but you got access to that tower.  We did.  And you're one of the first media people to ever do that, right?  Right, right.  And thank you for calling me a media person.  Media people.  My life is now complete.  And so we, but we did, we got access to the switching tower.  How did you get access?  You know what?  We told them we were the federal authorities.  No, we're doing an investigation.  No, you know, Travel Channel worked very hard, and the production company Indigo Films  that worked with them on this, they worked very hard at all of these various stories. 
[01:33:00]  And it was really impressive what they were able to do and the places we were able to go.  And, I mean, we went down to the country's only underground burial vault for radioactive waste.  We went down to the White Sands Missile Range, out to Ground Zero in the Mercury Town.  I mean, we went to places that were really fantastic.  And they really worked their ass off to get access for this.  Because, again, the idea, let's take the viewers someplace where they couldn't normally go on their own,  or someplace that's got a mystery or a conspiracy around it. 
[01:33:30]  Give them some information.  Give them some information.  Let them mix that in with what they know already and see what they come up with.  Right.  Informative, entertaining.  There you go.  So you're in the switching tower.  So we're in the switching tower.  We ran some tests.  We had a shooter at the picket fence firing off several rounds.  The first time that's happened in 50 years since the assassination.  And we did stop traffic for the test there.  And if you want to get an interesting result, go down to Dealey Plaza, 
[01:34:00]  because we couldn't stop the pedestrians from wandering about,  and fire a rifle in Dealey Plaza.  And it was, yeah, it was highly interesting.  Did people kind of jump a little bit, get a little jumpy?  Yeah, there was a busload of Japanese tourists.  Oh, boy.  They were all, I mean, and they were loving it afterwards.  They couldn't believe what they were seeing.  So we fired off several rounds from there, and then I had a chance to do the same,  just in terms of determining the nature of the shot.  And, you know, how difficult would it have been for a second shooter from behind that position 
[01:34:30]  to get this thing done?  And then what are they going to do?  How do they get off the axe?  And then we went up, and we looked.  They gave us terrific access up in the book depository,  in terms of getting to the actual vantage point for Lee Harvey Oswald.  That's glassed off.  They let you behind the glass?  They didn't put us behind the glass.  They let us to a no-access area right above it.  So we were one floor above the sixth floor, but we were at the window.  Right, right.  They allowed us to go up there, which, and it was very interesting. 
[01:35:00]  They wouldn't allow us to take a shot from there.  I think they felt that might have been too insensitive.  A little much?  Yeah, stretching a little bit too far.  But what was your opinion, looking out that window, feasible?  Yeah, it's 175 feet.  It's 175 feet.  Which isn't that far of a shot, really.  It's not that far.  The digital analysis or forensics work on the Zapruder film,  it looks at about 8.2 seconds or so for getting three shots off with a bolt-action rifle. 
[01:35:30]  People say, well, it's Lee Harvey Oswald.  He was a MOOC.  He had no training.  Well, he was in the military, and he did get his marksman badge, his credentials.  He was a sharpshooter first, I think.  He tested marksman before he left the military, but he did test sharpshooter earlier than that.  Yeah, and then if you don't keep practicing, which a lot of guys don't,  and they test and they get a lower certification.  But it's not like he got the headshot first ground off, either.  No, and it's not like, if you've got training, if you've got some level of training, 
[01:36:00]  you've got no wind or weather conditions, you've got a target that's moving maybe five miles an hour,  dead on line with you, you've already wrecked it.  He worked at the book depository, and so he had a chance.  He knew exactly where he wanted to be.  He knew exactly what that shot was going to look like.  And so in terms of just from an operational point of perspective, could he have done it?  Well, yes.  I don't think there's any doubt he could have done it.  But what I don't understand, why take the shot after the turn? 
[01:36:30]  Because to take it the other way, the Secret Service will be looking up at you.  Is that what they're thinking?  If you took it head on...  You're hanging out the window, right.  Yeah, you took it head on, every agent is looking in your direction.  Every cop's looking in your direction.  As he makes that turn, the focus is all heading down.  Sure.  And so as he makes that turn, and now he's also right in line.  Now they're focused somewhere else.  I understand.  So he had a very good line of sight.  Now, does that mean that it knocks out the conspiracy theory and all those other angles?  And was he acting, and this is a very interesting point, was he acting on his own? 
[01:37:00]  I think he was the trigger guy.  I think he was the shooter.  But were there other factors at play?  Right, right.  But we look at Lee Bowers.  We look at how he died as a witness in a very mysterious fashion.  And, you know, Belser's on there.  Richard Belser's on there talking about the conspiracy theory.  He's very interesting.  The Bels, yeah.  Yeah.  I love Bels.  So it's good.  But he died in a car crash on a two-lane country road by himself when he went off the road and crashed into a small bridge. 
[01:37:30]  It sounds like it's written for a movie right there.  But is that odd, though?  Because I've heard about it all these days.  And I thought I remember it was a car crash.  It's like, it's a single car crash.  They happen all the time.  You know, because he was tied to the Kennedy assassination, it sounds ominous.  But single car crashes happen all the time.  And then his body was cremated that evening.  All the more reason to do it that way so people could go, it happens all the time.  This was a great point you guys made.  They didn't cremate like they do today. 
[01:38:00]  No.  It was a lot rarer to cremate a body back in 63.  Yeah.  And he was cremated that night, according to the reports.  Wow.  Which is a little unusual.  His family was, who knows what that was all about.  But the problem is that so many of these folks have passed away.  And, you know, to a lot of them.  Well, it's been 50 years.  It's been 50 years, exactly.  A lot of the people.  So I think that's mysterious.  50 years and they're still not as young as they used to be.  But, Mike, let me ask you.  Of all this stuff, what is it that made you think? 
[01:38:30]  Because, believe me, it's hard to swallow the single gunman theory.  But that's what I've come to believe again.  Because I just, no other theory, no conspiracy theory held water.  None of them.  Like, you know, the whole, well, the guy was in the, and they shut up all the witness.  It's just, it's so illogical.  They would use this asshole, Oswald, who was an asshole, who had already fired another public official.  This is the last dumb motherfucker you'd use for this.  It's very dysfunctional.  You know, he had a failed experience trying to start a new life in Russia. 
[01:39:00]  And, you know, I mean, so you're absolutely right.  And that's what I, I always kind of lean towards with some of these stories.  Like we did, we did an episode on Martin Luther King.  And we were down in Memphis.  Again, sort of great access.  It was up on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, outside his door with the Reverend Kyles,  who was with him when he was shot.  He and Ralph Abernathy were in there, and they all started to come out.  And Dr. King stopped, leaned over the railing to talk to Jesse Jackson and Andrew Young and a couple others down there.  And then he got popped.  And so we did, again, same thing. 
[01:39:30]  We were running some forensic tests.  We talked to a lot of people.  Very interesting.  And the same idea.  People didn't want to think that it was just James Earl Ray, you know, shooting out of a second-story bathroom window in a rooming house across the street.  They wanted to think it was something different.  But when you look at the conspiracy, to Jim's point, you think, really?  So, you know, because there's conspiracy theorists in that story.  You know, they're thinking it's Hoover.  It was the Memphis PD.  It was the mob.  And it was military.  All of them working together.  And at the end of it all, they decide on James Earl Ray, you know, as the guy who's going to be the fall guy. 
[01:40:00]  And then they let him go.  And he escapes to London for two months and gets picked up.  So a lot of the conspiracy theories you can set aside.  But some of them do linger.  Some of them are just you get the feeling they're always going to be unsettled.  What's the lingering one in JFK or lingering aspect of it?  Well, people, same thing.  People don't want to believe that it was Lee Harvey Oswald.  And I think what you said was actually right.  I think that they was actually right.  I think you said something that was actually right.  Thanks, Mike. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, golly, Jane.  Oh, you know.  Gosh.  Yeah, how stupid was that statement?  But I think when they look at JFK, you think about the time frame.  And we weren't used to seeing stories every other day about some nut job, you know, with a rifle going into a school or wherever and shooting it up.  And news traveled slower.  People's expectations were different.  And certainly at that time, the idea that it was just one man who impacted the nation so much was very hard to believe. 
[01:41:00]  And it fueled this idea that there was something else.  And the longer it stays out there, I think, the longer it lingers, it's harder to get rid of.  Right.  What is a part of it that made you think it might be a conspiracy?  Well, there was another witness you had in the stairwell.  Yeah, there was a witness that was tracked down.  Never came forward before?  Was never interviewed.  There were a lot of people that weren't interviewed, which is interesting.  But not, again, not completely atypical investigations.  I mean, things get missed.  You know, interviews don't happen. 
[01:41:30]  But she was there in a position where if Lee Harvey had come running down that stairwell, given her position, and she was credible in terms of checking her out, she would have seen something.  She would have seen him, but what instead was, you know, no, I didn't see anybody coming down the stairwell.  And she was clear as a bell.  She was, you know, she was a sharp individual.  I'm not saying, again, I don't say that refutes the fact that he was a gunman.  What's the most compelling part of the JFK conspiracy? 
[01:42:00]  I mean, for me, I spent so much time behind a curtain, really, at the outfit that I'm not a conspiracy guy by nature.  And so, you know, I went into it, you know, with an open mind.  But I didn't, you know, I'm not a skeptical person by nature.  I tend to think that sometimes things are just as simple as they seem.  Right, right.  But when you, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  What you say about, like, the woman who didn't see him come down the steps?  I saw an interview recently with a kid, a young black guy.  He was probably 16 when it happened.  And they re-interviewed him now in his adult life, many, many years later, who saw Oswald poke out the window. 
[01:42:30]  Or somebody with a rifle poke out that window.  And there was a photographer, and I want to say he's the one that won the Pulitzer for snapping the Jack Ruby, that death photo of Oswald.  And his great regret was that he didn't snap the photo when he saw the guy with the gun.  And he, the day before, saw somebody with a rifle leaning out that window.  The day before, yeah.  The assassination, I'm sorry.  And he said one of his great regrets was not snapping that fucking photo. 
[01:43:00]  Why wouldn't he?  I think you got one good picture there, fella.  That was, like, his redemption.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Because they didn't think in the moment.  You know, you saw all these cops and stuff around.  It was a different time.  But you're a photographer.  Don't you just kind of shoot everything around you?  Oh, maybe.  Maybe he missed the shot.  Maybe he saw it and then missed it.  Yeah.  Well, that could be, that could also be, you know, Secret Service.  Because Secret Service are wrecking, you know, sites like that all the time.  And so it could well have been somebody.  It was something you don't see every day, whether it's Secret Service or, you know, Oswald.  You're going to take the picture, I think.  Maybe he tried to and missed it. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  But every episode we're doing something that I think, I hope, the viewers are going to find, you know, really interesting.  And we're trying to approach it from the point of view that they want something more out there.  They want some information.  They want, obviously, everybody wants to be entertained.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, not every show can be, you know, two dames fighting over a wedding dress.  People are fascinated by that whole thing, though, you know, conspiracies and what happened.  Well, they want more information.  What else are you working on?  We did a variety of things. 
[01:44:00]  We did the Escape from Alcatraz in 62 days.  Oh, right.  Yeah, that's cool.  What do you think happened with that?  I've been to Alcatraz.  Yeah, fascinating place.  It's fantastic.  I love Alcatraz.  They gave us access.  Unbelievable.  Where do you get to see that the average tourist doesn't?  Right.  And we were there at nighttime.  Oh, well, because some of those tunnels that they have the ropes across, I'm like, oh,  man, I wish I knew someone here so they could take me on a tour.  We didn't start working.  We didn't really start filming each day until after everybody had left, the tourists had  left.  And so we were there basically through the night.  Wow.  And that's an interesting experience, walking around. 
[01:44:30]  And they literally just let us, you know, so I wandered all over that place at nighttime.  It's a pretty fucked up place.  It's got to be pretty creepy, right?  It's pretty cool.  Have you ever been in?  No, I've never been there.  It's awesome.  Again, same thing.  People should be going to these places.  And I say that over and over during these shows.  I said, if you haven't been here, you've got to come take a look at this.  I mean, there's so many places around this country to see.  But Alcatraz, we looked at Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers.  How about Charlie Butts?  Yeah.  Charlie Butts.  Charlie Butts. 
[01:45:00]  Now we've got to go back and do a whole new story.  So Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers, they went on about a year-long effort to get  themselves out of Alcatraz.  And it was an incredible effort.  And they basically, they discovered that the walls were crumbling because of age and the  conditions, the weather conditions, and the type of concrete.  And so every night, they would kind of use a spoon or whatever they had.  Frank Morris made it like a little makeshift electric drill out of a motor he took out of 
[01:45:30]  a vacuum.  And they would drill and drill and drill and drill through this concrete until they'd  made spaces.  And when you look at these spaces and think what they did, they crawled behind it.  And what they'd found was, from other inmates who were being put to work by the guards to  do plumbing, they'd found that there was a three-foot crawl space behind their cells,  in between the cell blocks.  And so if they could get through the back wall of their cell, these cells are tiny, they'd  get into this crawl space.  And then they found, over the course of a year, they'd crawl up these pipes, they'd get 
[01:46:00]  to that top of the cell block, and they figured out a way to get onto the roof to get through.  They had to cut through rebar.  And they tried a variety of things to get through the rebar in this concrete.  And what they finally settled on was, they would take dental floss from the dental shop,  and then they would take contact cement from the shoe shop.  They all had to work.  It's not like today.  These guys all had to work.  Right, right, yeah.  And they had to take contact, and they would cover the dental floss in contact cement, and  then they'd cover it with silica that they got from the dental shop, and they would  let it harden.  And then they would use it like a, you know, a saw, like a little bandsaw. 
[01:46:30]  Like a file type of, yeah, yeah.  And they would just, day after day, night after night.  How long did that take?  Holy shit.  It took, it took about a year.  And they could only work at night after the lights off.  And most of the prisoners were in on it.  So they were really tired.  Right.  Most of the prisoners were in on it.  Because they would, because you had to make noise.  And so every time they would, you know, prisoners would start making noise or banging pots  or whatever.  And they, I mean, some of the things that these guys did were really impressive in terms of just  trying to get yourself out of there.  Now, they had some time on their hands, right?  Yeah, yeah, true.  Where are they going?  What are you going to do? 
[01:47:00]  And then they did, but they didn't know really much at all about the tides, the ebb, the current  in the bay.  But then they made a raft out of raincoats issued from the prison and using contact cement.  And then they made some homemade paddles out of some wood that they stole from pallets.  And one night they took off in November, 62.  And that was the last anybody heard from them.  So we did the same thing.  We recreated the raft out of that same crappy material, made some wooden paddles, and tried  to paddle right across the fucking door. 
[01:47:30]  No, it was like, you know what it was like?  It was like trying to paddle a hot tub.  It filled up with water.  And so, and we're out there in the middle of the bay for hours, right?  And just not going anywhere.  Well, we are going somewhere.  We're going out to sea.  The currents are that rough?  Currents are awful.  And if you don't get it right, you're screwed.  And so, you know, there were a lot of odds stacked against these guys.  But, you know, just the sheer will of trying to do this and get the hell out.  But then you've got to think, once they finally got out and over the wall and down the rock 
[01:48:00]  and down to the water, and then, you know, these three guys, you know, they were just,  you know, they weren't pleasant guys.  But now they're looking at the bay thinking, so they had to get in the water in the middle  of the night in November and try this.  It's a fascinating thing.  We ended up swimming because the paddling just wasn't going to work.  Yeah, yeah.  So how far was it from, I know they thought they went to Angel Island.  Right.  How far was the, from Alcatraz to the mainland, was it a mile or not quite a mile?  It's not that far.  It's not that far. 
[01:48:30]  It's about a mile.  But their concern was apparently, according to some of what they gathered information from  the prisoners, was their concern over being discovered as soon as they, you know, set  foot on ground.  Uh-huh.  So, because it was, and you could sit in Alcatraz in those days and in the cells, and  you could hear the noise of people in the bars and having fun and, and, and, you know,  the Yacht Club.  Right.  And so, you know, you get tortured.  That's torture.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That drove them nuts, they said, was hearing the women having a good time at the Yacht Club. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  Unbelievable.  But Whitey Bulger was there at the time, and he's been in the news recently, and Al Capone,  of course, and, and, and, but we had a chance to talk.  We talked to a guy named Patrick Mahoney.  Oh, Whitey Bulger was in that?  I didn't realize.  Whitey Bulger was there when they broke out.  And, but Patrick Mahoney was a guard that night, and a fantastic guy, huge guy.  Hands like, you know, hams.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So, that's, that's the second season.  And that's Patrick Mahoney, the classified.  Ah, big cops across America. 
[01:49:30]  So, hey, shit.  Well, you gotta, you gotta keep moving forward.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  But, uh, Patrick Mahoney was there, and, and he talks about it, and he talks about, uh,  and he just, he's just a big guy, and he just, and he just, and you can see it still  burns in him, you know, the, the idea that these guys got away.  Yeah.  Whether they lived or not, it just pisses them out.  They got out.  Yeah.  Whatever, whatever.  They did get out.  Did they ever find anything?  In the movie, they find a little bit of, you know, flour, which is nonsense.  Um, but what, did they ever find any trace of the raft or anything?  They didn't, no, not the raft.  They found, uh, some personal effects, and they found a paddle. 
[01:50:00]  Uh, they found a, because these guys had, you know, they had taken a different time,  right?  And think about prisoners now escaping, but these guys had actually fashioned out of  that same, uh, raincoat material.  They fashioned a couple of little envelopes or something, and they'd put some letters  in there and things that they wanted to hold on to.  You know, what the fuck?  Letters from mom, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so they, uh, you know, found some of that floating in the bay.  Um, because they went, they went out, uh, and then the morning call when they, they  went to rouse the prisoners up, um, you know, they'd go along the line and, you know, and, 
[01:50:30]  and, uh, one of the, one of the, I think it was Frank Morris didn't, didn't, uh, get up.  That was the first one they noticed.  And so one of the guards walked up to the, to the bars, you know, and said, to the bars.  And, and, you know, which I guess is what they would say, because I just said it.  And, uh, and so he didn't move.  And so he kind of, you know, went in there and jabbed him.  And that's when his papier-mâché head fell on the floor.  Yeah, they actually built there.  And Patrick Mahoney said, that guard screamed like a girl.  Oh, really?  That would scare the shit out of you.  Yeah, exactly.  What was the common belief by the warden and the guards? 
[01:51:00]  I mean, do they really think that they got, we all like to believe it.  They probably drowned, and I hate to say that, because no, no one ever heard of any of them.  You're going to tell me two brothers and a Frank Morris just went through the next 50 years without being heard from,  or getting re-arrested for anything, or pulled over, driving, or, you know.  Right, yeah.  No, it's, most of the guards think they died.  And a lot of people think they died.  And I, you know, I think the odds are hugely stacked against them.  And I agree with it.  The fact that nobody talked, you're going to tell me, look, people can't keep their yaps shut over a period of time. 
[01:51:30]  And that's, you know, to your point again with JFK, you know,  you think that somebody's not going to talk in a vast conspiracy.  And what did they do for a living?  They didn't commit any more crimes.  They didn't, you know, in all those years, you would assume something happened.  Unless they went to Canada.  And back then, it was easier to lose yourself and change your identity because you weren't tracked electronically.  So that's possible they could have went to Canada, given different names, and lived.  Or maybe one of them found a way to get on a plane and went for London.  Who knows?  But I doubt it.  Yeah, right.  But it would be very difficult. 
[01:52:00]  But it was a fascinating thing.  And I tell you what, that water is cold.  61 or 62?  62.  The end of 62.  And that water is very cold.  And it's teeming with wildlife.  I didn't see any sharks.  But there's a lot of activity in the bay.  And it's fantastic.  You know, one of the biggest threats was they were working on the World Cup or the World Cup.  The, what do they call it?  America's Cup.  All right.  And so, you know, the boats were out there practicing.  It was before it started. 
[01:52:30]  And, you know, these things are moving like rocket ships.  They don't look like sailing boats anymore.  No, of course not.  Yeah.  And spaceships with a sail.  Right.  Exactly.  And barely a sail.  It's a big old fin.  And so this thing was, an Emirates boat was out there rocketing around at 35 or 40.  And, you know, we're out there in this fucking stupid, shitty fucking raincoat.  Raincoat, raincoat.  And we're heading out to sea, boys.  And I have two great guys with me.  Both are professional swimmers who, you know, have swum the bay a lot.  And, you know, they signed on because they thought, yeah, anybody's stupid enough to try this, let's give it a go. 
[01:53:00]  But they were, you can see, even halfway through, they were completely frustrated with these paddles.  And they just wanted to get in the water and swim.  And swim for it.  And I said, no, I think we've got to keep paddling.  I have heard the theory that they were helped by someone in a boat who met them in the thing.  The guy English played by Paul Benjamin in the movie.  I forget what his, I don't know what his real name was.  But the black guy, that he might have had somebody meet them.  And that, if that happened, that's the only shot I think they had if somebody actually met them, you know, on some prearranged night or maybe one of many nights they were out there waiting for them. 
[01:53:30]  All bets are off of that if they actually were smart enough and capable enough to get that done.  But we talked to the U.S. Marshal, who is still on the case.  It's an active case.  It's an open case.  That's amazing.  Yeah, exactly.  So it's a great story.  But there's a lot of these just like that in this show.  America Declassified on Travel Channel on Sundays at 10 p.m.  It's an open case book.  Sounds great, man.  It's an open case book.  What is he doing 50 years later?  Like, what lead is he tracking down? 
[01:54:00]  You see him on the coast just kicking with his foot looking for something.  He does this a lot.  Puts his hand over his forehead and just squints into the sun.  Walks up and down Fisherman's Wharf with pictures of the guy saying, have you seen him?  Seen this guy?  Imagine him a little bit older now.  Have you seen him?  He just interviewed a new witness and he realized it was one of the actors from Escape from Alcatraz.  I interviewed Officer Zimmerman, who was there when the man chopped his fingers off. 
[01:54:30]  Alcatraz is an amazing place.  It's fantastic.  And then just the furry ride out to it is cool, you know?  It is.  The whole part.  And you know what?  There was a community out there.  The guards lived out there with their families.  Oh, with their families.  And they went to school and everything.  They went to school.  Patrick Mahoney, his kids were born out there.  Their birth certificates say Alcatraz.  That's amazing.  And look how close it is.  You don't realize how close it really was to San Francisco.  That's a long swim in a November cold, though.  It is, but if you're swimming for your life, you can probably motivate. 
[01:55:00]  Because Frank Morris was, at least the way they painted him in the film, an extraordinarily bright guy.  And for guys to be this smart for a year and then just be so dumb they don't realize the water's going to be cold doesn't make a whole lot of sense either.  Right.  And you're right about that sort of that will to live.  And if you had nothing else going for you.  Swimming for your life.  But at a certain point, at a certain point, the odds just stack up against you.  It's an amazing plan and execution of the plan right up until you've got to get in that fucking water. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  Then it becomes a crapshoot.  You know, the rest of it, they did an amazing job of distracting the guards and thinking they were in there with the fake heads.  And figuring out how to get through that wall, up the pipes, get through the bars, like all that shit.  Right.  And then it's like, great, we've got a current that'll pull you right out to sea, freezing cold water.  I mean, obviously, they're not swimmers, they're criminals.  Yeah, they've been eating prison food and smoking and, you know, they're not in great shape.  But again, you can't underestimate sort of that will, that desire. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  That when you know you've got nothing else going, you know.  But again, it's just sort of like that, okay, that takes you so far.  But then the reality will kick in.  But there's a lot of these things.  We did the D.B. Cooper, you know, America's a real hijack.  Nice.  Fantastic.  That's an amazing story, too.  What do you think about that?  Obviously, he's probably dead, but I mean, they found his money under silt or whatever, half of it, or $5,000.  What do you think?  You know what?  That's one where I fall back on the same thing we talked about before. 
[01:56:30]  To think that this guy would go out the back of a commercial jet in a business suit, in loafers.  So he landed without his shoes.  There's no way of going out there, doing that job, and keeping your shoes on.  So he landed in the middle of the Snoqualmie Forest, which is a vast wilderness up in northwest America, in Washington State.  And the idea that he's going to survive the jump, first of all, and then get himself out of that forest, is very hard to believe. 
[01:57:00]  But he could be living with Bigfoot.  Well, he could be, exactly.  And people say, well, you know what?  We never saw him.  We never spotted him.  But when you stomp around, and we did for a long time, when you stomp around in that forest, you realize what it's like for search and rescue.  You realize you almost have to step on the individual.  And he was jumping out with a military-grade chute, you know, Odie Green.  And so that thing up there, hung up in the trees for all these years.  People aren't just, you're just not going to spot it.  Didn't he, by the way, take the least of the, like he took, they said if he really knew what he was doing, he would have taken the other chute. 
[01:57:30]  There was a couple of chute options they gave him, and he didn't take the one that probably was better for him to take.  Which was fascinating, because it's almost like they were just, I mean, who does this?  But they gave him $200,000, and they gave him, you know, chute options.  He turned it back and said, no, I want.  But his choice could be interpreted a couple different ways.  It could be interpreted that he did have some knowledge.  I don't think he had any experience, but he had some knowledge of what was going on.  But still, same thing.  Going out the back of that plane, landing, and then trying to make your way out.  If you get hung up in one of those fir trees, which I ended up having to do, and then trying to make your way out of your chute, out of your harness, and figuring out how to, you know, what are you going to do how to get down, and then get the hell out. 
[01:58:00]  And it's a tough old place.  And the news came out quick.  So the next day, the place, you know, it's vast, but there were a lot of people all out there hunting for $200,000, right?  All the townspeople came from the surrounding, you know, towns, and they were out there stomping around, and nobody ever found it. 
[01:58:30]  And there are people who have been following this case for ever since, you know, for years and years and years.  And I just think it's hard to imagine.  They did find some money, about eight, nine miles down the watershed.  But it's a tough one.  But I tell you what, we recreated the jump.  A good buddy of mine up in Washington State runs a great jump center, Capowson Jump Center.  And they did a great job.  So it's, you know, there's all these things going on.  I think if the viewers give it a chance, I think they'll really enjoy it, and we're really doing everything we can to sort of drive eyeballs to the screen. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Very cool.  It sounds like a blast.  It's called America Declassified, airing on Sundays on the Travel Channel.  10 p.m.  Yeah, and every viewer gets a free kitchen appliance, personally delivered by Jim and I.  Absolutely.  You don't know that, but yeah, it's a new plan.  I'll do the funny spatula scene from Stripes on your hiney.  Remember when I did the spatula with PJ Soule, I'll do that on your hiney.  I stunk that scene. 
[01:59:30]  All right, we should take a break.  We'll take a break.  You can hang out, Mike.  Certainly.  Amazing.  Thank you very much.  We might be doing some Jocktober next or something, but...  If you hang out for this next segment, we will officially alienate you from every other radio show.  Exactly.  That's true.  Well, thank you very much, because, you know, it's something new.  You know, I love coming in here and talking about whatever the hell is going on in the world.  But you're a TV star.  Plugging something is a different feeling.  A project going on.  This is...  It sounds really entertaining. 
[02:00:00]  You're going to take out...  Very interesting.  You're going to take out Duck Dynasty.  No.  Wouldn't that be great?  You're going to take him out.  You're going to be the one.  Yeah.  It'll be me.  Honey Boo Boo and Duck Dynasty, dude.  I don't like this newfound success.  I know, right?  Look at that.  We want to see Mike again.  Yeah.  No, I'm going to stay just as much of a douchebag.  Very good.  Then you'll fit in perfectly here.  Mike, thanks so much for coming in.  Thank you.  Thank you.  If you want to have fun for maybe five minutes, 
[02:00:30]  put T-H-O in the Twitter search,  it'll blow your mind.  How do you just put T-H-O at the end of sentences? 
[02:01:00]  It's true.  What the fuck?  Like a retarded Shakespeare.  That's a big one in the community, huh?  Oh, you didn't know this.  What is with the though?  I noticed this a while ago,  and it's all black people.  Okay.  I'm mad.  I've seen a homeless person with a laptop.  Though.  That doesn't...  You didn't know about this?  I had no clue.  Twitter trends are started with black people,  and they're kept going by the black tweeters. 
[02:01:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you'll notice that.  You'll notice that, though.  You'll notice that, though.  Should we be using, though?  Yeah, I know.  I don't know, though.  Are we allowed to?  The T-word.  The T-word, though.  I can use it, but you can't.  Oh, yeah.  The mac and cheese dough.  This mac and cheese dough.  Was made by God himself.  I like this one.  I can live off string cheese.  Like, really, though. 
[02:02:00]  These are all real fucking twigs.  It kind of works in a weird fucking way.  Oh, man.  You guys are back to the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  Ah, very funny.  All right.  You want to do some Jacktober?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah?  We haven't done Jacktober in a few days, I think.  I know.  The month is coming to a close. 
[02:02:30]  Yes, it is.  It's Jacktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jacktober.  O-M-G.  Host.  Holes.  Bits.  And Stunt Boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for... 
[02:03:00]  Jacktober.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  Bolt movie.  All right.  There we go.  Going to Virginia.  Richmond, Virginia.  Oh, what's in Richmond, Virginia?  Mornings with Melissa and Jack.  Aw, that sounds fun.  On 103.7 Play.  What do they play?  Why?  103.7 Play?  Oh, yeah.  It's like push play, right?  Like play? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  I see a play button in their logo.  So I guess, you know, we're going to be hearing the music.  Right.  It's the music.  Not just music.  Yeah.  It's a little personality thrown in there, too.  That's good.  I see Kanye on their website.  John Mayer.  John Mayer.  It's the hits.  They love playing the hits.  No twerking.  You see that?  No.  They're one of those no twerking stations.  All the hits with no twerking.  That's just fun. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  That's just some fun.  Well, give me a little background on these two.  Well, Melissa and Jack.  Melissa's the radio girl.  The fiery redhead.  She is a fiery redhead.  Fiery redhead.  Isn't she cute?  She's all right.  Well, that picture, she looks all right.  I know.  She looks kind of cute.  All right.  What's going on?  Little redhead.  What's going on?  All right.  That picture, she does.  All right.  Show me another picture.  All right.  That's Kim Kardashian. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  That's another one today.  All right.  Where is this?  I don't know.  Show her to me, Sam, before your job is.  I need a good mental image of these people, or else I can't hate them as much as I really  want to.  That's her on the left?  Wait a minute.  A little thick, but not bad.  She's cute.  A little different from the phone. 
[02:05:00]  She's not bad.  That's nice.  Whatever.  She's a handsome guy.  She's a pretty cute girl.  All right.  All right.  All right.  So physically, they're not abominations.  Yeah.  And then they got Jack.  What's their bio say?  Melissa's been doing radio for 10 years.  Whoa.  Over 10 years.  Oh.  Then she should know better.  She is the whole of the show, I would assume.  She grew up in Richmond.  Yeah.  And she lived with her husband, Tyler.  Born and raised.  Yeah.  I thought Jack was her husband. 
[02:05:30]  No.  Jack is a little, he's a little younger.  Oh, boy.  He's only been doing radio for a couple years.  Is he out of control?  Does she need to rein him in?  Well, before he was in radio, they found him at a bar.  No.  Literally.  Oh, God.  Is it like when Rocco had to find his partner?  Find his partner at Fenway?  So they picked a seat at Fenway and just happened to pick a guy that was his been in radio?  That's what a dumb bitch.  Bullshit.  Jack is one of Richmond's most beloved bartenders.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And he happens to love radio. 
[02:06:00]  So when he's not on air, you can usually find him working at the bar or drinking.  Hey, look out.  One side of the bar or the other, he's right at home.  Or driving and ending someone's dream when he runs a red light.  Yeah.  Can we get right into this?  Yeah, let's hear these problems.  Well, they've got to tease for an upcoming story, which ends in hilarity.  All right.  103.7 Play Mornings with Melissa and Jack. 
[02:06:30]  It's 6.58.  Today's going to be mostly cloudy with a high of 72.  Stop with the weather.  Stop with the fucking weather.  The weather is on your fucking phone.  Stop.  Let me see.  Boink.  There we go.  There's the weather.  55 degrees.  Yeah.  Partly sunny.  Yeah.  There you go.  And now the listeners have it.  It's on my fucking phone.  You don't need to do weather on the radio.  No.  Unless it's a big super storm or something. 
[02:07:00]  I like information.  Today's going to be mostly cloudy with a high of 72.  And a lot of us have done some strange things to look for love.  There's a lot of unorthodox methods for it.  But someone from Richmond has gone to the extreme.  I mean, I kind of feel like she's giving more attention to this than you would, like, looking  for a job.  This is, like, a serious thing.  Yeah.  She wants to find a husband, and she is pulling out all of the stops.  We're going to tell you about it.  I mean, this woman is serious.  I kind of love her for doing this.  It's so cute.  It's kind of psycho, too, but we'll talk about it. 
[02:07:30]  That was the tease?  Oh, man.  Kind of psycho.  We'll talk about it.  I really, I'm getting very annoyed with her voice.  Very quickly.  Talk about it, right?  It's that chick radio voice.  You know how the guy has radio voice?  That is the epitome of the chick radio voice.  A lot of weird listeners to this show.  Oh, yeah?  I'm only judging that based on their Facebook page. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, okay.  Their Facebook page is...  We like all their Facebook page.  You get to know them a little more.  Sure.  Fans posting?  Yeah, ones posting just photos of Coke floats.  Wow, that's weird.  I wonder how they do that.  Coke floats in my cup, E-Rock Army, and then they write the N-word with an A.  Oh, my God.  One person named Dolores Chipperson, which looks like Jim Norton with lipstick on, writes,  Any black guys with big pekkas?  That's not funny at all.  Oh, that's my mother.  Hey, it's Scorch. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, it's a picture of Scorch that says, I'm taking your jobs now.  You know what I mean?  Oh, it's E-Rock and Roland on those scooters.  The fat twins.  It's the fat twins from the Guinness Book of World Records.  That's a first.  That is a good one.  You see what the caption says?  No.  Too fat, too furious.  I boat my tree, dude.  I have no idea.  More E-Rock photoshops.  I thought that was E-Rock shitting on the side of the expressway, but it's not. 
[02:09:00]  We all know he did that.  DJ Douche.  It's a photo of E-Rock.  Aw.  Me and Travis.  There's a photo of what looks to be an old man, no shirt on, with a beard, having sex with  another man.  And he's obviously plowing another man in his ass.  Yeah.  Oh, a deformed baby.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  That's beautiful.  It's October.  Yeah.  Okay.  A photo of a pig enjoying some food from a trough.  He's full of mud and dirt.  Yeah.  Except it's E-Rock's head. 
[02:09:30]  Got E-Rock's head on.  The dreamy face.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  What the fuck?  An exploited large woman.  Fat woman.  Oh.  All right.  That's a lot.  God damn.  She's lovely.  She's got very Rubenesque features.  That's a huge vagina.  Sal is a total faggot.  Who wrote that?  You know the story that they just teased a moment ago?  We're going to find out if Melissa gives any whole cues.  Thank God.  Oh.  She could be a whole.  So a lot of us put a lot of effort into going on dates. 
[02:10:00]  Obviously, you hear that in second date every morning.  You know, it takes a lot to try to go on that first date and make sure that that relationship  works.  But when you find yourself not even getting a first date, sometimes you got to pull out all  stops.  And that's what someone here in Richmond is doing.  And then they go to a story about a serial rapist.  Local woman, DeVise Clement, I think I pronounced that right, she's a former ad executive with  Barton Agency.  She's now a hairdresser.  Has decided to launch a full-scale ad campaign to find a husband. 
[02:10:30]  I love this.  We're talking billboards.  We're talking print.  We're talking TV.  Possibly radio.  Even drink coasters that she's going to leave out at bars with her contact info in case  the right person comes along.  I mean, you think this is a good idea.  I think it's a way to find a bunch of creepy dudes.  Stop.  No way.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No way.  No way.  That's a typical hole right there.  Stop.  No way.  That voice is so fucking annoying.  This show is not enraging, though. 
[02:11:00]  It's just like typical.  Not yet.  No way.  Not yet.  Yeah, it's not gracious.  There's a photo of Jim Chandler and the brilliance.  Here's the brilliance of this photo.  My college pal.  I started radio with this guy.  This is the person that Opie used to do college radio with that was featured on Jocktober  last year.  Or two years ago now, maybe.  They took his smile and in Photoshop they turned it upside down and made it a frown.  They made it a frown.  And then the caption says, Greg Hughes crushed Jim Chandler's dreams on purpose. 
[02:11:30]  And that's on 103.7 Plays' Facebook page for some reason.  Yeah, that's weird.  I don't know why.  Well, Melissa certainly is a hole with that.  Oh, no.  No way.  There's a Photoshop of Laurel and Hardy.  And then under that is Colin Quinn and Bobo.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, they're the new team.  But we do have to check something.  Uh-oh.  Because it appears that...  Uh-oh. 
[02:12:00]  That's...  Oh, where's the Facebook?  What happened?  Phase one is complete.  There is no public wall.  Why?  Why would they do that?  We didn't even give out the Facebook page.  But we do know that in the comments on their pictures, right?  Oh, yeah.  You can still comment on their pictures.  For instance, they posted a funny YouTube video of Katy Perry and Robert Pattinson, or whatever  his name is.  Yeah.  And the first two comments, number one is, I want to see the boat movie.  Oh.  And number two is, it's a battery car. 
[02:12:30]  It's like a battery car.  Yeah.  It's a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  It's like a battery car.  Hey, it's Mr. Cockadoody Fox.  How you doing?  You've been phone scammed.  How you doing?  I can't feel my nose.  This is Lindstrom Perry Dorkins.  Hey, this is Waffa Doodle McFunny Nook. 
[02:13:00]  Did you leave your bee stingers in my hat?  What?  This is Funny Boobs McElbow Nookles.  Did you leave your bowling balls in my shoes?  Do you have the nose clip, too, E-Rock?  I can't even feel my own nose.  I can't even feel my own nose.  I can't even feel my own nose.  Do you know how funny that would be if he was saying that as they loaded him into the 
[02:13:30]  back of an ambulance?  Oh, shit.  Well, guys.  I don't wish him ill.  We're looking at Melissa and Jack, and it's time for the Second Date Playback.  Yeah, I heard her allude to this.  Yes.  Second Date Playback on 1037 Play.  Second Date is where we attempt to help you with your love life.  Sometimes you go on what you thought was a great first date, only to have the person  not call you, not text you afterwards, just completely ignore you.  And that's where we come in. 
[02:14:00]  We actually put them on the radio, and we try to get them to tell you what went wrong  and why they haven't called you back for a second date.  Good morning, Craig.  How are you?  I'm good.  All right, Craig.  So tell us what happened.  So this girl that comes into the bar where I bartend, she has been, I guess you would  say, hounding me for like the last two months.  Her friends have also been mentioning it.  She's just been really interested, you know?  And I can tell that she's been interested.  She'll stay a little bit later than everybody.  So fuck her and shut up.  And then finally I was like, you know what?  Fine, I'll take her out on a date.  You know?  We went out on a date, and you know, it wasn't stellar, the date, but it wasn't bad. 
[02:14:30]  It was just, it just sort of happened, you know?  And now I called her, and it's been two weeks, and I haven't heard anything back from  her.  You know, just nothing.  So basically you got forced, not forced, but kind of a...  Coerced.  Yeah, coerced.  Coerced into taking her out, and now she's just avoiding you?  Yeah.  Is this real?  Do you think it's real?  Of course not.  No.  But it's not real.  But I do almost get tricked every time.  You know why? 
[02:15:00]  The setup sounds viable.  The setup sounds like something...  No, that's where I thought it was fake.  No, no, I don't mean their actual execution of the setup.  I mean the setup itself.  You got a guy, he goes out on a date, you call the girl or something.  Like, it's something that could be done.  It's not like the Rose is one where it has to fall in place like a miracle.  Yeah, but you're not, you're confused.  Why?  What happened?  They don't call and say, you're on the radio. 
[02:15:30]  Oh.  Here, they say, oh, this is Jack's friend.  I just wanted to know if you thought that...  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Oh, you're on the radio!  All right.  So, it's another service, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  This will be sweeping the country soon.  By the way, uh...  Yeah.  If you go to their Facebook page where the wall was closed...  Right.  Uh-huh.  I guess some people realize that Melissa from Melissa and Jack has her own Facebook page.  Oh, that's nice.  How do they realize that?  We haven't given out any of this info.  I guess there's a link to it, but there's just a lot of weirdness going on on her page. 
[02:16:00]  She looks good in that picture.  Yeah.  She kind of looks like the girl from Mythbusters.  She's using a squish...  Carrie Byron.  Carrie Byron, indeed.  She's using, like, a squishy app.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  Some voodoo.  Squishing the sides in a little bit.  Technological magic.  Why is Jim Chandler on her personal page?  Right next to Trayvon.  Yeah.  That's her.  That looks a lot different.  What happened?  Now she looks like Tony Soprano's sister. 
[02:16:30]  Janice.  Janice.  What happened?  How do you go from Carrie Byron to Tony's sister, Janice?  Oh.  Wow.  She does look like she's dating a narcoleptic.  She...  She yo-yos a lot in Wade, I bet.  I bet she yo-yos a lot.  Well, the ratings and radio will do that to you.  That will.  I hear you.  So why don't we get into this?  Melissa gets her on the phone.  Shh.  She doesn't know she's on the radio.  All right.  Don't tell her.  Okay.  Melissa's going to call Aaron, and I need you to stay quiet because she doesn't know that 
[02:17:00]  you're listening in.  Okay.  Cool.  I got her.  It's ringing.  Hang on.  The old it's ringing.  Hello?  Hi.  Is Aaron there?  This is Aaron.  Hey, Aaron.  My name is Melissa.  How are you this morning?  I'm good.  Hey, I wanted to ask you something.  If you've got a minute, is now a good time?  Yeah.  Well, you and I actually have a mutual friend named Craig, and rumor has it that you guys  went out the other night, and I was just curious to find out how it went.  Oh, you know, he's been calling and texting, and I'm just not interested. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, but there's got to be a reason why.  I mean, did you guys have a good time on your date?  You know, I've had a crush on him forever.  It turned out...  You're like, who is this?  Why would you give up all this info?  God, I hate this.  Can we really just put ourselves in the situation of a complete stranger cold calling you, and  then without even telling you really who they are, they give a name, but not any relationship  to the guy, and be like, who are you, where are you, and you just start babbling out all 
[02:18:00]  this fucking personal information?  Would you do that?  How do you feel knowing that they tricked you in the beginning again?  They almost got you.  I don't feel too good about myself right now.  No?  You know, I thought we were used to it from when they talk about fixing the console.  Right.  So we know.  It's like to expect something and think it's real, and then have it just turn into pure  fantasy.  You know who is feeling good?  What?  The guy on their Facebook page, a photo of whom is posted.  He is in front of his high school logo, it looks like.  Awesome cougars. 
[02:18:30]  And he's naked.  Uh-huh.  He's being quite awesome right there.  Well, yeah, he's got his legs pinned up against the wall, and he's fellating himself.  He's actually giving himself a blowjob right there.  Right, right, right.  Amazing.  All right, well, this is bullshit.  I've had a question on him forever.  It turned out he's just kind of like this passive, almost pussified, like, boring guy.  Really?  So, you know, while we were out, I kind of wondered, like, why I'd ever had a crush on  him.  The dates suck. 
[02:19:00]  Girl, what happened?  Girl!  What happened?  Girl!  Real talk.  Real talk now, girl.  Girl, you tell me what happened.  Who's this a photo of on her Facebook page?  Oh, no.  I have no idea.  I know who that is.  Okay, it says, Anatomy of Jocktober, and it's pointing to different parts of this person's  body.  It's posts and stump boys and witty banter and phone scams, prep burger, the whole, keeping  it local, War of the Roses, fugitives, song parodies, and what makes it fun is it's a 
[02:19:30]  big, fat body.  Ugh, disgusting.  Naked body.  Obese.  And it's nude, and as it turns out, it's a photo of Terry Clifford.  Terry Clifford's a big, fat head with her Brady Bunch Afro resting on top of it.  Let's leave the cliff alone.  Well, here's the big reveal, guys.  The big reveal.  On the second date thing.  What were you thinking that day?  Oh, this is a photo op.  There's a Photoshop of Anthony and Jill Nicolini dressed as a cowboy and a cowgirl right under 
[02:20:00]  Don and Deirdre Imus dressed as a cowboy and a cowgirl.  We were in Nashville.  That's on Melissa's Facebook page.  That's correct.  She's a fan of you, I guess.  Oh.  Here's the big reveal.  Well, he picked me up, and he was literally like, well, what do you want to do?  Wait, so he asked you out, and then he didn't have plans on where you guys were actually  going?  Yeah.  Oh, dude, that's lame.  And the conversation was boring, and he was too quiet.  And so we went to a bar, and he ordered a swishy girly martini after I had ordered 
[02:20:30]  a beer.  It was a gin martini.  It wasn't a swishy girly drink.  How was that a girly drink?  Aaron, you're actually on second date on one of our three, seven, four.  Oh, shit.  I've been listening in this whole time.  Listen, I, you know.  I'll call the FCC.  I didn't know you were listening, and I don't know that I would have phrased some of these  things so harshly if I knew that you were.  Wow.  And the voice is starting to sound familiar. 
[02:21:00]  That's like a War of the Roses voice, I think.  We've probably heard the voice over the course of this last month.  I've heard all these voices.  One more clip here.  Now an organic, real fight between two people who aren't faking.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  That's what you're about to hear.  Okay.  You're really different when you're behind the bar.  I mean, you're really charismatic.  You're really attentive to everyone.  So what, you think you're just the most charming person on the date?  It takes two to have a conversation, you know?  It takes defense.  I mean, bartending for a cute girl and being on an actual date with a cute girl are two 
[02:21:30]  entirely different things.  You know, she's hot.  You know, she's hot.  I'm not trying to get tips from her.  She's a cute girl.  But, you know, the conversation was terrible.  It was like I was having a date with a cardboard cutout.  Whoa.  I mean, maybe we should try a second date.  Okay.  So you're going to give, well, I don't know if it's giving Craig another chance.  Give me another chance.  Is that what you were about to say?  No, there's going to be no second date.  That's not going to happen.  So Craig, Aaron wants to give it another shot to prove that you guys could work and you don't  even want to go there?  I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but it's just not going to happen. 
[02:22:00]  You know, I heard what she said while she thought I wasn't listening, so.  I think she used the word pussified.  Yeah.  That probably sealed the deal, guys.  So it's not going to happen.  I didn't want to go on the second date anyway, so I can't come to your bar anymore.  Well, she's not a good tipper anyway, so there you go.  All right.  Yes.  Tell me now.  Okay.  So this is awkward.  You guys aren't going to see each other again and there'll be no second date.  Done.  Well, thanks for the help.  Second date on Mornings with Melissa and Jack.  Holy shit.  At least it's not War of the Roses, I guess, right? 
[02:22:30]  It is.  It's the same thing.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That's horrible.  Photos were laughing.  We're not laughing at the radio bit.  We're laughing at some of the postings on Facebook.  All the postings are fantastic.  That's what gets us through that horrible audio.  Yeah.  It's the same thing.  Oh, it's young Sam Roberts again.  It's just the same fucking formula as War of the Roses.  They're just changing up the concept a little bit.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  Oh, that's terrible. 
[02:23:00]  So.  Yeah, it is exactly.  You know what I think that is?  I think that's War of the Roses if you don't want to pay to use War of the Roses.  Right.  Ah, there you go.  Just get some people from around the office.  We're going to go back to Jack Tober in a second, but we've got a very important phone  call coming in.  What?  Hello?  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, man. 
[02:23:30]  No, we're not done with Jack Tober.  Lady Di, you've been falling scared.  I just did that to get a reaction out.  Jimmy, it's my favorite thing.  Oh, that was so great.  We've got Aziz outside the studio.  That's why we've got to stop Jack Tober for now.  But we'll go back into it at the big conclusion of today's Jack Tober in a few minutes.  But first, let's get Aziz in here.  He's been pissed for a minute or two outside the studio.  Yes.  Bring him in.  He's very famous.  He's extremely famous.  He's sitting down now.  He's just sitting, drinking water. 
[02:24:00]  Roland's out there.  No one's listening enough to get us.  Well, we're not really allowed to have the show on outside the studio.  No, I didn't want that on.  I don't want the show on out there.  No, absolutely not.  It's a big problem.  They almost got us sued.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  By an ex-employee.  Yes.  Come on in there, sure.  Take a seat.  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  Take a seat.  We're all just doing a radio show or some type of thing. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, there's your headphones.  Look at that.  Your phone?  Your phone?  Yeah.  Oh.  No, that noise?  No.  Yeah.  Oh, those aren't your headphones.  Oh.  Ah, there they are.  What is that?  What's that?  Wait.  Is that coming out of his pocket?  No.  Wait, it is.  That's not mine, guys.  I'm a professional.  What were you listening to?  It sounded familiar.  Random song, I don't know.  It certainly sounded familiar. 
[02:25:00]  That was really freaking me out.  That was weird.  Yeah, no kidding.  That was...  Creepy.  Absolutely.  Yeah, we were doing Jocktober.  It's where we further alienate ourselves from the rest of the entertainment industry by  just attacking other radio shows.  Yeah, other radio shows that, in our expert opinion, suck.  Yeah, we feel like we're the only ones that should be doing this.  That are worthy of mic time in any capacity.  Right, we should be on every single radio station.  Yes.  This show.  They're awful on the road.  You gotta go in there and just do...  They want you to do your act.  It doesn't feel right. 
[02:25:30]  Oh my God, it's the worst.  That's gotta be terrible.  Yeah, I did one in Miami one time and a guy was like...  I was tired because, you know, if you're doing stand-up and stuff, you're up late doing  shows and stuff.  And if you're doing shows late at night, that really wakes you up when you do a set.  It's hard to, like, fall asleep after that.  And so, if you're a comic, you're generally gonna be tired when you do the shows.  And the guy was so mad that I was tired.  He's like, hey man, you better be funny.  Like, let's get it going.  And I was like, alright.  You know what?  It's best when you just have a conversation and, you know, things just come up that are funny. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Wait, did he actually say you better be funny?  Yeah, he said something.  Wake up, man.  On the air he said this?  No, no, no.  In between, in between.  Yeah, but still, man.  I was sitting there and I was like, alright, man, it'll be fine.  And then, uh, and then at a certain point, like, they just brought out this, like, big  fat dude and they, like, put butter on his belly and that was, like, a segment.  And I was like, I gotta get out of here.  Oh, the old butter on the belly segment.  Yeah, I mean, what do you do with that? 
[02:26:30]  What was the...  At that point, it's like, well...  Was there a payoff?  This is in my audience.  Yeah, what was the bit?  Maybe we, uh...  Maybe you just gave us an idea.  Let's not judge.  We don't really know what...  What was the butter on the belly thing?  What the hell could they possibly have been doing?  I wonder what the end game is there.  Right.  What the fuck?  Sometimes you go in and they have things planned.  Like, I was on Cowhead one time in Tampa, who we love.  Yeah, we like the Cowhead.  But as I'm on the thing, they brought in these girls and they were eating dog food on their  hands and knees out of a bowl.  And I'm like...  You can't compete with that. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, what do I do with that?  Right.  You know, I sat there with an erection like everybody, but it was just...  But it's the worst when they expect you to do your acting.  They're like, where do you want us to lead you?  What do you want to talk about?  And it's like, dude, just chat and see what happens, you know?  Have a little chit chat.  See what pops up.  Indeed.  You got a special coming out on Netflix.  Yes, it comes out November 1st.  Friday.  Very excited, yeah.  That Netflix is just a booming thing.  It's taking off.  Amazing.  People are going there for first run stuff like comedy specials and TV shows. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  You know, it was just pretty much a blockbuster where you didn't have to go to the store  for a while.  Now, original programming.  Original programming.  Well, that was it.  At the beginning, it was like...  Oh, my God.  You go to the website.  I'm mailing stuff, though.  They send you a DVD.  Got to mail that one back before they send the other one.  I hated that.  And I would never mail things back.  Yeah.  It's weird because they used to just profit so much off laziness. 
[02:28:00]  Right.  I would be like, all right, I need to get, like, these, you know, like, when you get  kind of homework movies, like, oh, you know, I've never seen a Who's Afraid of Virginia  Wolfe.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll watch that soon.  And then you just have them sitting there.  And you're just like, I'll just watch Kindergarten Pop on HBO instead.  Keep these DVDs aside.  I'll send it back.  I'll watch them eventually.  And then it's just like a year.  At Blockbuster, I must have given them probably ten times more money in late fees than I did 
[02:28:30]  in actual video rentals.  Because I would just have them sitting there and be like, I'll take it back tomorrow.  Eventually.  And then I just wouldn't take them back.  And then you try to dump it into the deposit thing and run so the person doesn't look at  you.  Thank God that's done.  But I remember the high of going into Blockbuster and seeing all the new releases.  Like the new release box covers are the one I wanted to see.  And they always guaranteed that they'd have copies.  Yeah.  Oh, it was wonderful.  The wall would always look the same.  And then you're right. 
[02:29:00]  All of a sudden it was like another color would hit you.  Like, whoa, that's a green color.  What the?  That's a new movie.  Oh, I'm so excited.  I remember I used to like, you would have to call to like, see if they had the video in  stock.  Yeah, yeah.  I grew up in South Carolina where it's so boring.  So you just, you would love to see a movie or any kind of depiction of another place  is more interesting.  So I would just call constantly to see if they had stuff in stock.  And it's so interesting.  Now it's like kids don't have to do anything.  No. 
[02:29:30]  Now there's so many different places to get it right.  You could just illegally get them or on demand now gets them pretty quickly after the movie  even comes out.  And then Netflix, of course, Hulu, you know, there's a bunch of places.  I thought if that's like made kids cooler now, because I remember, you know, now kids  can watch anything.  They can watch, you know, the coolest stuff.  You know, they can watch, you know, Scorsese movie or they can watch, you know, Mr. Show  or whatever.  Like the coolest stuff is available to watch instantly. 
[02:30:00]  And when I was a kid, it was like, you had to watch like the garbage that was like, you  know, full house or whatever.  Or you're just like not watching anything.  Yeah.  It's like, well, I'll do this over just nothing.  And you're forced to ingest it.  I wonder, I hope kids are now like taking advantage of the fact that they can kind of watch anything  they want.  Instead of full house, you're watching Mean Streets.  Yeah.  Six year old.  Oh, sure.  Quite an upgrade.  It was such a fantasy, such a futuristic dream to be able to choose what you watched when you 
[02:30:30]  wanted to watch it.  And that was only on television.  Now the thought that you can just bring your phone and watch a movie on the chitter if  you want, you know, it was, I used to, I used to imagine what it would be like to have  like a watch with a TV on it when I was a kid and just be like, oh, I can watch TV.  You know, that would be the coolest thing.  You ever think we would get to that point?  Never think.  No.  Unbelievable.  And, and, but by the way, that, that fantasy just included what was being broadcast at 
[02:31:00]  that time.  Right.  So, you know, I'd watch the, what, the noon news at school and sit there.  It would, it would be an amazing fantasy to think about.  But now, you know, I could go HBO Go if I want to and just fucking watch shit for, I  got a sling box set up.  I could watch my own fucking television on this thing.  I got one two years ago from my manager.  I never hooked it up a sling box.  Yeah.  It just seemed too, but it wouldn't work.  It is so fucking good.  I could pop any channel on my file system on this phone right this second. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Just watch it.  Hey, right from my, right from my home.  I'm a VCR guy.  I can't resist technology.  You know what?  You give me a VCR and a good movie.  You know, I don't know much.  Hey, that noon, it's still blinking.  You know, 12 noon.  What do I...  Aziz said something in there, though.  You come from a boring town.  So how did you make it?  It had to be a lot tougher.  I went to school at NYU, so I moved to New York. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, okay.  That was the big job.  Yeah.  I always admire people that just have moved to New York just to, like, they're like,  I'm going to become a comedian.  It's like, wow, you're a fucking brave person.  The balls of that they move.  I was here at school, and, you know, there's all these other kids that are at school.  At the same time, you're all kind of going through New York at the same time.  You have all these other kids.  And then you think about, you know, I know comics that have just, like, moved here with  nothing.  And they're like, I'm going to become a comedian.  And they fucking do it somehow. 
[02:32:30]  It's incredible.  What, were you at film, right?  Were you doing the film thing?  No.  I didn't know what I wanted to do, and so I went to the business school, because I  was like, oh, I'll start a business or something.  And then I got to the business school, and I was like, oh, my God, I hate every single  person here.  Yeah, yeah.  All these kids that wanted to do finance and all that stuff.  Like, I didn't even know what, like, Goldman Sachs and stuff was.  And they're all, like, so fired up about this stuff.  And I was going to transfer to the film school a couple times, and I just got too lazy.  It was like, oh, you got to put a portfolio together. 
[02:33:00]  And I was like, eh, whatever.  So how did you make the...  It was a terrible decision.  But actually, it didn't matter.  I mean, but...  Right, yeah.  But how did you make the jump to comedy and entertainment, then, in that position?  I just started doing stand-up when I was in college, like, the summer of my freshman  year.  I just started doing stand-up, and, you know, I really enjoyed it, and I just kept...  Why people were like, you're funny, dude.  I mean, pretty much, yeah.  You gotta fuck.  You should be on stage.  Ah, nine times out of ten, they shouldn't be. 
[02:33:30]  That's pretty impressive, though.  Really.  People really love it.  It's interesting to watch them walk out of the cellar, because it's an amazing...  And I've kind of seen it change over the years, you know, when you know somebody and  you watch them gain success, and so it's an amazing ovation, and it's always silent.  And I mean that, like, when you're setting up a joke.  People always...  It's always silent after you.  No, no, no, no, no.  I mean that...  They laugh, but I mean that they're always paying attention to what you're saying.  Like, they really enjoy you.  There's something about you that people just genuinely like when you're on stage. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, thanks.  And it makes me want to scream in the back, because you never want to see another comedian  being loved.  Of course.  It's just painful to watch.  That is a big brother that just passed by.  I think he's going into Shade 45.  Oh, probably.  Who was that?  Was he a player or a bodyguard?  Could have been him.  Well, that's true, too.  You don't know if...  It looks like a...  Wow, I see a giant shadow.  That guy...  I think he's just a black dude.  He's a big black dude.  That is just a black dude.  I think that's a big guy.  I think he's just a black guy that's in the serious offices. 
[02:34:30]  Right.  Yes.  There could be a black gentleman in the hallway.  If that's a bodyguard, it's like, come on, man.  There's bigger black dudes to be bodyguards.  That's true, too.  Roll's looking at him.  No, something's going on over there.  Yeah, Roland.  Let's call Roland.  Because once in a while in Shade, we'll have a really cool guest walk in that we'll try  to hijack, or we'll try to...  All right, here comes Roland.  Let's see who that is.  Roland, what's going on at Shade?  It's a T.I. with the game.  T.I.?  Oh, the game?  I don't know.  I know there are two people.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, I don't know who they are.  You don't know who they are?  Come on. 
[02:35:00]  This is the dummy, Roland.  This is the guy who books our show talent-wise.  He's amazing at it, but we don't understand why.  This is how pop culture ignorant he is.  We were walking into an MTV press junket that I was doing, and we see somebody who looks  kind of famous, and he was not kidding.  He goes, that's Jay-Z.  I'm like, really?  He goes, yes, that's him.  It was the guy fucking wanding people as we walked in.  But he wasn't being ironic.  He really thought...  He just says things in hopes that it sticks. 
[02:35:30]  That's Jay-Z.  Well, he can't see.  You know that, right?  Roland can't see.  Are you blind, too?  Yes.  He needs glasses badly.  Another reason why he falls asleep at movies.  And then when he came to my party during the summer, we're all going in the pool and stuff.  It's like, Roland, go in the pool.  He goes in the pool, and it's like, well, swim over here at the deep end.  I can't swim.  He can't swim.  He's blind.  He's a little kid.  He was staying in the little shallow end.  Put little swimmies on him. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, adorable.  You're also doing the 92nd Street Y?  Oh, yeah.  What a smart place for a gig.  I've gone to a couple.  I saw Poitier speak there, or Poitier, however you say it.  Sidney Poitier.  Sidney Poitier.  Yeah.  Yes.  That fine actor.  I saw him in L.A. one time.  I was going to eat sushi with a friend, and I saw him just sit and eat sushi by himself.  And it was like, he did a really good job.  It was very elegant.  Very gentlemanly. 
[02:36:30]  I was still in the pharmacy in L.A.  I had stopped on a lark going on the way to the hotel.  You know how it is.  You've got to pick up a little Viagra because you forgot yours, and L.A.'s a big act-out town.  And I saw him in the Beverly Hills Pharmacy.  Just fucking buying something.  I bugged him for a photo.  He was very nice.  But it was like, you know, no one gave a shit.  I'm like, how do you not know who this is?  It's weird when you see these older, kind of legendary things, walking around doing the most mundane shit.  Just nothingness. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  You expect them to be parties or something.  Yeah.  Some kind of event.  But a regular actor, I can understand.  But this guy is a guy that any single person in that business would cancel plans to eat with.  Anybody in the business would cancel what they were doing to have dinner with Sidney Poitier.  Yeah, yeah.  He's just, yeah, it's just like, you're always going to be alone.  That's the message.  That's the message right there.  That's the lesson.  And you see him eating sushi by himself.  That just makes me sad.  In the end, you die in your own arms. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, you want to think like, oh, once you do like a really great thing and stuff, you move beyond all the garbage that, you know, I'm doing.  And then you see people in your world, you're like, what?  Isn't there another world you can graduate to?  Yeah, yeah.  Something.  It ends up being the same shit.  We saw Christopher Walken getting takeout one night.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah, we were having dinner somewhere and he walked in and he's getting just bags of takeout.  I forgot all about that.  And he did that slow turn and looked over his shoulder to see who was looking at him.  He was in character for that movie.  Big, tall guy. 
[02:38:00]  The long black leather jacket on.  Yeah, it was cool.  I love those movies where he plays the archangel.  Is it Gabriel or Michael?  Yes, that was it.  That's how long ago it was, yeah.  Prophecy.  Prophecy.  I like those movies.  He was great in those.  Especially the first one was really good.  I forgot about that.  Did you see him?  I might have to revisit those.  Yeah, he plays the archangel.  The guy who played the devil's a little douchey and really enjoying playing the devil.  Over the top.  Yeah, like a little, ooh, the evil guy with the beard.  The only over-the-top devil I want to see is Pacino.  He's an absentee landlord! 
[02:38:30]  All right.  You screaming guy.  We get it, pal.  I liked Keanu Reeves in that movie, though.  I thought he was fucking...  Yeah, he fit the bill.  I liked that movie.  It was all right.  Kevin Lomax.  I think it was a little over-the-top.  Yes, that's it.  That was a good one.  And I really believe you.  That's like...  I can do like...  That's...  Okay, that's where the name comes from.  Okay.  No, no, no.  Because he knows what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Ooh.  That's one of my random things I can do an impression of is like Kevin Lomax from The Devil's Advocate. 
[02:39:00]  Now I'm like, now you're going to be like, do it.  Now we have to go.  No, we're like the DJs in Miami.  Come on, let's go.  Come on.  Perform.  Where's that bad guy, Butter?  I want to hear Kevin Lomax.  Before we get to the Butter guy.  I'm an attorney.  My name is Kevin Lomax.  Milton.  Kevin.  Kevin.  Oh, God.  What if I just did all of Devil's Advocate right?  I've seen that movie.  Isn't it weird? 
[02:39:30]  Like certain movies that are like okay movies and you end up seeing them like a million times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because there's something about him you like.  Like I loved Pacino in that even though he was over the top and...  No, it's fun.  It's a fun movie to watch.  It is.  It's, yeah.  There are certain movies that are so easy to watch.  You know them.  Sometimes you don't want to put too much thought into something.  Or if I...  I know if I'm going to sleep, I'll put something on that I've seen a thousand times because I  know I could just shut my eyes, listen, and kind of run it through my head while I doze. 
[02:40:00]  While I drift off to sleep.  I can't do that.  I have to have silence when I sleep.  Complete silence.  I cannot have TV on.  Yeah, I...  Yeah.  Do you doze during a Vos show?  It's hard to sleep with a noose around my neck.  Teasing, of course.  Rich is great.  Are you a good sleeper or are you a...  You seem like a piece...  I've never seen you upset.  You never see me upset?  I don't get that upset.  I sleep all right, I guess. 
[02:40:30]  When I'm in New York, I don't sleep as well because I'm up late doing spots and stuff.  In L.A., you know, I'm filming and things like that, so I have to get up early, so I'm  used to going to bed a little bit early.  You're quite a good actor, too.  Is this a really natural, good actor?  No, I'm not.  No, you are.  Acting, it's not that hard.  You know, like, I was thinking about this, that movie, did you guys see Captain Phillips?  Oh, yeah.  The boat movie.  Yeah, so the guy who plays, like, the lead Somali pirate, he was great, right?  Yeah.  He was great.  They're talking about he might get nominated for an Oscar or something. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He was a cab driver.  He's just a guy.  He was just a cab driver.  He'd never acted before or anything.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  In what other field can you just instantly become one of the best?  There's no way that would happen in stand-up.  No.  That's true.  No way that would happen in radio.  Nothing.  Where it's like, well, he was just doing, you know, he worked at Target, and then now he  has the number one radio show, like, a month later.  It's like, no.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't happen.  Yeah.  Acting is the only thing you can all of a sudden incidentally be good at. 
[02:41:30]  Like, that and prostitution.  Probably two jobs.  You can go from doing something else to being really good at really fast.  Man, did that guy look the part.  He was amazing.  He was so scary.  He just looked like a beat-up Somali pirate.  He really did.  And the most famous line, you know, is that when he's like, I'm the captain now.  Yeah, yeah.  He improvised that.  That wasn't in the script.  Really?  Yeah.  He's fucking rewriting.  I mean, not trying to take away anything from that guy.  I mean, he was incredible.  It's a natural.  I think it's amazing that, like.  He could do that. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, it was like, oh, he just came in and was acting with Tom Hanks.  I think they just, like, did, like, a big casting call, you know?  Get a bunch of white guys over there and said, just pick out the scariest looking guy.  Who would you be scared of?  Yeah, look at him.  He's a real slight guy, too.  Well, there's probably not too many Somali actors that are capable, so they probably just  did, like, an open casting and said, let's see who we can get.  Well, Tom Hanks looks scared in that picture.  We'll act for a sandwich.  That guy is thin.  In that publicity shot, Hanks looks scared. 
[02:42:30]  I think he lives in, like, Philadelphia or something.  He was in some city there doing a big casting call.  He lived in the States.  And someone probably told him, hey, they're looking for guys who are Somali, and he came.  Well, that's...  It looks like Michael K. Williams a little bit.  Dream come true.  Yes.  You know what?  A little bit?  Watching the movie, he reminded me of Michael K. Williams a lot.  Yeah.  I don't think they all look alike.  Just, but in this case...  In this case...  He kind of reminded me of him, too.  It looks a little bit like Michael K. Williams from The Wire.  Yeah.  Who's getting a lot of fucking action in Boardwalk Empire this year.  I don't know.  You don't keep up with it?  I have not delved into a... 
[02:43:00]  It's good, man.  Did you watch it?  No.  I haven't, but I heard it's good.  Yeah, the series got better.  Like, HBO series, I can lock in.  I can't lock in much from Showtime, but HBO, I can just fucking...  Game of Thrones, I can lock into it.  It's hard to jump in to a new series.  Like, Breaking Bad was all the rage there.  I was right on board with that.  And then that finishes up, and I'm kind of like, you know, you really got to commit.  When you go with a series that's been on for a couple of years, too, you got to commit 
[02:43:30]  to sitting there for hours on end, doing those marathons, to really get up to speed.  You can't just casually start watching one of these shows again.  And now, like, I feel like there has to be such a groundswell of people telling you, like,  oh, this is the most amazing.  That's the only way I'll start, because it's like, sometimes you start these shows, and  then it gets really dumb in, like, the third or fourth season.  You're like, why did I fucking invest 30 hours with you?  Asshole told me to fucking watch this.  Yeah.  Did you start anything that you didn't like?  I don't want to say. 
[02:44:00]  I feel bad.  Well, that's not really.  Usually, I don't have that.  I know.  Isn't that weird?  See what that is?  See what he just did?  I don't need people, man.  Opie did it.  I mean, Aziz did it.  What?  And Jimmy can do it, too.  Me and Opie will sit there and just shit on anything without any thought that maybe  down the road we might be fucking insulting somebody.  Maybe that's why we don't get as many opportunities.  That could probably.  See, it might be smarter to do it there.  Oh, of course it's smarter.  And there's also a mentality where some people just don't like to insult other people. 
[02:44:30]  Aziz is just a nice guy who doesn't like to hurt people's feelings and insult people.  I'm an insensitive piece of shit.  Well, he wouldn't be good at radio, then.  Right.  Yeah, you've got to kind of be a creep to do this every day.  He probably goes home and pulls wings off a butterfly.  Yeah, he does.  Something will come out about Aziz that's just truly terrible.  He's like, you're putting nails in the crib.  What?  He would videotape thumbtacks in the crib.  I don't like insulting TV shows, though.  It's just not my thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's putting nails in the crib.  That's mean. 
[02:45:00]  Those babies have never done that any good.  Gunny sack full of kittens.  He's going down to the river.  But you do get embarrassed when you bump into somebody that you've shit on.  Well, you had one of the big ones.  That's what I...  That's the situation I avoid.  Because now you never know what's going to get picked up.  Yeah.  All these blogs and stuff are just looking to fill space.  You just say anything.  Oh, and they're waiting for someone to trip up.  Like, oh, God.  Yeah.  Like, that girl that was at that Halloween party that had the blackface on. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that.  I was like, man, well, they're covered for a couple of days.  They could do the apology.  They could do everyone's thoughts on the apology.  They could do everyone's thoughts on blackface.  Julianna Hall.  Who was she doing blackface?  Julianna Hall.  She was...  They were doing the cast of Orange is the New Black.  They were doing, like, a bunch of girls dressing like the cast of Orange is the New Black.  And she was that crazy-eyed girl.  So she put on blackface.  And she had blackface.  And they had, like, all her friends and stuff. 
[02:46:00]  And I think she was the only, like, you know, actress, like, person out of the group.  And they're like, all right, who should do the blackface?  Let's get her to do it.  Let's pick her.  There's all the girls.  Now, here's the thing.  I don't see any fucking problem with that.  Zero problem.  Because she's dressing as someone.  If the person you're dressing as is a black person, I mean, you gotta change your skin tone.  You gotta go all in.  I'm not that, like...  I'm not, like, offended by that, really, that much.  I think it's like, oh, you know you're gonna get in trouble for doing that. 
[02:46:30]  But that's just it.  Like, she should know she's gonna get in trouble.  But the whole thing that she's gonna get in trouble irks me.  I understand if someone puts on fucking mammy makeup and starts going, mammy, how I love you.  And doing an old minstrel show type of thing.  That's not what that is.  That's a little more offensive than that.  But if you're legitimately dressing up...  They had a couple of guys, and they were dressed as two basketball players from a photo that was put online.  It was two real NBA guys. 
[02:47:00]  And these two guys were both white guys.  And it was one white ball player, one black ball player.  The black ball player's got his, like, elbows on the other guy's shoulder, looking over the top of his head.  So they recreated that.  The one guy had to put on blackface makeup.  He didn't have to.  But he did to recreate the picture, I guess.  And then it was tweeted.  The picture was tweeted by some NBA entity.  Who immediately... 
[02:47:30]  Like, they were like, wow, this is a great representation of this photo.  Immediately!  We regret that we said this, or we apologize.  They apologized.  But meanwhile, it's like they were recreating the photo.  Again, you've got to look at context.  Nobody comes out and just gives a rational explanation.  Like, when you're...  The difference in intent between...  Oh, right.  That's a problem.  Like you said, doing a minstrel show, and just being mocking and shitty.  Yeah.  And portraying a legit TV character. 
[02:48:00]  They are tremendously different intents and different things.  And the fact is, nobody comes out and defends themselves properly.  She should have come out and said, look, I'm not sorry.  It's an impression of a character who I like on television.  Right.  It was a Halloween costume.  I'm dressing as them.  And if you can't see the difference between me being a Halloween character...  Right.  ...of a character I admire...  Right.  ...and a minstrel show, then shame on you.  Or there's other people getting in a lot of jam-ups here because they're going as Trayvon.  So they put makeup on, put blackface on, put a hoodie on with blood, and they got Skittles 
[02:48:30]  on that cake.  Well, that guy's just trying to be an asshole.  Let's be honest.  I mean, come on.  Trying to be an asshole.  Unbelievable.  You know the difference.  Now, that obviously...  That guy's just trying to be a dick.  It's insensitive.  Oh, my God.  It's inciting.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy in blackface with a hoodie with a red splotch in the front of it.  And another guy with neighborhood watch on his shirt, pointing his fingers at his head  like a gun.  Oh, my God.  I mean, obviously, that's offensive.  It's inciting people.  It doesn't have the same thing as Juliana Hough doing what she did, or Hogue, or Hogle. 
[02:49:00]  That G-H really confuses me.  H-O-U-G-E-L.  Her whole name is Hogle.  It's so weird.  Like, you know, all this kind of crazy stuff used to happen, and we just didn't know about  it as much.  Yes, exactly.  And now it's like anything like crazy offensive like this just goes viral, and the person's  like, it's ruined.  Is destroyed.  That guy's...  I mean, who's going to hire that guy for any job? 
[02:49:30]  Like, everyone...  I've never hired someone for, like, a job, but I'm sure you Google everyone.  You Google.  Yes.  And that's going to be the first thing.  It's like, well, you're fantastic.  And you're just...  Trayvon.  I really want you to be the architect for my house, but, uh, yeah, I just saw your Halloween  costume.  I saw it.  Remember 12 years ago?  Halloween, when you did the black, but because it never goes away.  Yeah.  I have a little problem with that.  And, you know, and part of me is like, oh, good, man. 
[02:50:00]  Fuck that guy.  And then part of me is like, God, that's the rest of his life.  Rest of your life.  A mistake.  Like, you know, does...  Yeah, yeah.  Like...  See, offensive Halloween costumes have always been a part of it, though.  Like, I remember when Chris...  Yeah.  I laughed so hard one...  And I was in the village, and a guy was walking around with a Superman outfit, and he  had a wheelchair attached to the front of him, and I'm like, the genius of that.  But there's always, like, whatever happens that's brutal during the year, there's going  to be a Halloween, whether it was 9-11, like, whatever horrible tragedy, somebody 
[02:50:30]  will have a fairly clever Halloween costume depicting that event or mocking, and that's  even a part of it.  It's just such a...  We've always had it, but like, Aziz is saying, now it goes viral so quickly.  There are so many people that had crazy offensive, like, 9-11-type costumes, but we just didn't  see them, because this has become a thing in the last few years.  Only the people at the party and maybe a couple pictures got out for the local people,  you know.  How many dead jambanets were around for Halloween?  I mean, what's more offensive than being dressed as a murdered child? 
[02:51:00]  So this year is the Trayvon?  This Trayvon is the huge offensive, that's the go-to offensive costume.  I think that's got to be the number one go-to offensive Halloween costume this year.  Anything you could think of will happen.  You think you're going to have one of these at your party this Friday?  You know what?  I don't know.  I would hope not.  Is the lady in the middle supposed to be George Zimmerman's wife?  I don't know what she is.  She's dressed like a river dance girl or something, or an Irish girl. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, God.  I just can't believe it.  Every time I did it, I was like, this was done, this happened?  And he went with the real black blackface.  He didn't go with the...  That was not the realistic...  Right, the brown...  Pretty much looked like me.  She browned herself up.  Yeah, yeah.  He's using the old vaudevillian burn a cork and rub it on your face, blackface.  God.  And there's also Robert Downey Jr., who brilliantly portrayed a black guy in that film. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, in Tropic Thunder.  That was so great.  Amazing.  But why is that allowed?  And why is that above approach?  You got some shit for that.  But I mean, not where it would have counted.  Not job-threatening.  Not where it would have counted, because he's Robert Downey Jr., and he's a genius actor.  But what is the difference?  Why is that acceptable?  It's because he played a character.  Well, you know what I mean?  What she was doing was totally legit.  Yeah.  The Wayans brothers...  And I understand whiteface wasn't a big thing.  Didn't offend me.  Yeah.  Yeah, white girls.  But you got to look at different levels. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, that thing...  Yeah, I didn't see that and have any kind of...  No, no.  It's just like, oh, it's more like, oh, this is a dumb thing that's going to be in the news  for a couple of days.  No one wants to look at context anymore and intent and things like that.  They'll lump her...  There are people that will lump her doing that in the same category as the guy doing the  Trayvon, which is ridiculous.  Well, there was a thing, like, didn't Sarah Silverman go on, like, Conan or something,  and she was doing a joke that was, you know, against, you know, Asian racism.  But in the joke, she says, like, Ching Chong Bing Bong or something. 
[02:53:00]  And she also said...  Oh, she said chink or something.  And the joke was, like, a pro, you know, Asian...  Like, it was, like, a commentary.  But that gets lost in the word.  And then they just...  Yeah, those groups that are just, like, just waiting for something.  You know, just saw it, just didn't look at, like, what she was actually saying.  Right.  And then just, like, gave her a bunch of hell.  And it's like, come on.  Like, it...  And that's always a bummer when those groups, you know, just have those knee-jerk reactions. 
[02:53:30]  They hold people hostage.  They hold people hostage.  Their careers.  And it's amazing they have that kind of power.  People just tell them to go fuck themselves.  You know, fuck you.  No.  Going with your thought, you guys ever have problems with Parks and Rec?  Anything that has gone on there?  No, nothing.  Or something you wanted to do, and people were like, no way, this is going to cause too much  of an issue out there.  No, nothing ever on Parks.  I'm trying to think of anything I've done in stand-up or anything as a... 
[02:54:00]  You were part of a great comedy.  It's easy to do in one of my favorite comedies, which was fucking Seth Rogen.  Oh, God.  Observing Report.  We love that movie.  It was fucking hilarious.  Way better than Mall Cop.  Hilarious.  That's the movie you make if you're doing the whole mall thing.  Yeah, that was brutal.  We love that movie.  Fucking great.  I think I'm ready to watch that again.  But, you know, that did a lot of things that you thought, like, especially, I love the  Diana Farrah scene, where she was drunk and comedy, and he fucks her anyway. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  God, it was fantastic.  That was real comedy right there.  Because you suspend disbelief in a comedy just like you do in a cop drama.  Of course.  Like, nobody thinks that Mel Gibson's really a police officer or Schwarzenegger's really  a robot.  Why do you think that somebody really means a racist comment if they say it in a comedy  or a homophobic comment?  Yeah, right.  Why can't you suspend disbelief there?  It just has become this thing that these groups have to do.  They jump on it and get attention for their group.  It's, yeah, it's ridiculous. 
[02:55:00]  Well, as a society, we all accept it, though.  That's the problem.  We were discussing earlier.  We all got to speak up more about it.  Yeah.  Because nobody defends each other.  Because it's not the majority.  It's the minority.  I truly believe that.  Sorry, what were you saying?  It's the minority that is getting all the attention.  I don't believe the masses are that offended by this stuff we've been discussing today.  Yeah.  Not even close to the majority.  It's like, it's really like the news outlets create these stories about outrage, and it 
[02:55:30]  kind of gives this perception that there's a bunch of people upset about something, when  it's really, it's just like filling up space about stuff.  And it's kind of a, like, I saw, you know, there was a, the Indian woman won the Miss  America contest, and then, like, people tweeted racist stuff, and it's like a few hundred  people tweeted racist stuff, okay?  And then that became this big news story, and it, like, put a cloud over what she did.  Yeah, yeah.  Her accomplishment.  And it's like, well, you know, why, why, who cares if someone tweeted? 
[02:56:00]  That means they get to get on the news?  Like, I mean, if it happened, like, ten years ago, they would have said the racist stuff  at home.  There wouldn't be a record of it for them to, like, make a news story out of it.  And it gives this perception, like, oh, well, the whole country is still racist, because  the Indian person can't even win the contest, and now all these people are tweeting racist  stuff.  And it was, you know, inconsequential, the number of people that did that.  That actually did that.  It was nothing.  That's a great point.  Yeah.  You're always going to get that, no matter what it is.  I don't know why they have such power.  Yeah, you could.  I guess because it makes a good story, obviously, for the news. 
[02:56:30]  The news loves it.  The news people have to fill up their time.  It's just trying to come up with some sort of headline that people will click on.  Right.  Could you imagine these, I mean, when you think about it from their side, even though  they're despicable fucking animals that run the news, you've got 24-hour news cycles.  You're constantly in need of news.  Yeah.  Like, these guys have built these creatures that need to be fed 24 hours a day. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  So they're grabbing anything they can, pumping it up to make it interesting, because if you  just take it as it is, most of these stories, if you really research them, aren't half  as interesting or exciting as they make them out to be.  Yeah.  I sometimes didn't feel that.  Like, I'll see a headline, and I read all this shit, and I try my best not to.  I try to stay off my phone, and I'll read that stuff, but, you know, every now and then  you get bored, and you do it, and sometimes you'll see that outrageous headline, and you'll  click it, and then you'll read it, and you'll be like, oh, I thought this was going 
[02:57:30]  not even near that.  Yes!  I've got it boomed.  Yeah, yeah.  Especially when you go to, like, news sites, like Drudge is one where you'll click on a  headline.  It'll be very exciting.  And then you realize it's like, no, it says possibly.  You like the words, like, well, you know.  People are saying.  It's things like, you know, a meteor on course for, you know, Earth.  And it's like, oh, well, this will be the closest that anything's passed since last  week.  Right.  You know, and then it's like, we're going to miss this by a million miles. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, yeah.  When Obama does on the Tonight Show, it's funny, because, you know, because Jay likes  Obama, and I know he likes Obama, but the headline on Drudge has read, Leno versus Obama, like  on the up of the night before the show.  And it's like, this is not going to be a big war.  I remember when Carlin did it with Ann Coulter, and the headline was, Carlin versus Coulter.  And I had seen Ann after that, and I'm like, how was it doing it with Carlin?  And she's like, he was lovely.  Such a nice man.  Like, she couldn't stop raving about how sweet George Carlin was. 
[02:58:30]  There was no fight.  There was just two people who did a talk show together.  But they make it into something.  Well, that's just it.  They have to keep shoveling coal into the burners.  But we're all full of shit, because, you know, like, we know that that information is,  like you said, zapped out there, and it's irretractable, and we can never be taken  back.  Like, and we're all living with this new set of rules, and we're all vulnerable to it for  something that we normally don't see coming, and yet we don't give each other a break on  it.  Like, it's almost like if we were all in a movie together, and then we were holding each 
[02:59:00]  other accountable for the crimes committed in the movie.  Like, how fake are the other actors to not understand that we're all in this shit together?  Like, and we can't tell the difference between a guy that does something legitimately hateful  and a guy that slips up in a joke.  Or does it for complete entertainment.  I don't believe it.  We do know the difference.  We just seem to like to watch each other swing by the neck.  It's a real sickness.  Well, when you're watching someone swinging, it ain't you.  Yeah.  So, it's a lot nicer that way. 
[02:59:30]  So, point the finger and accuse other people of things.  Speaking of hateful diatribes, Aziz's special, film with me.  It's on Netflix.  I don't have the paper in front of me.  It is, when is it on Netflix?  Friday.  November 1st.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Friday night.  Okay.  And it's, what's it called?  At midnight or 12.01 or whatever.  You have a bunch of specials.  Which one is this?  This one's, it's called Buried Alive.  Okay.  Yeah.  Is this the one I saw that you, it was on Comedy Central last year or whatever or no? 
[03:00:00]  No, no.  This is another one.  Jesus.  You pump out a lot of material.  Is this a Netflix exclusive?  Yeah, it is.  So, you're doing it directly for them.  It's not going to be seen anywhere else.  After a few months, I'm going to do the $5 download.  If you don't have Netflix and you want to buy it, like I did the last one, you can do  that.  Okay, yeah.  Because some people don't have Netflix or, does that, when you do a $5 download or whatever  you do, can people get that in other countries?  They can't, right?  Yeah, and Netflix is kind of worldwide now, too.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  So, you're making a lot of $5.  Yeah.  I mean, it's great because people want to own it.  A lot of $5.  So, it'll come out like six months after that.  And you can also see Aziz performing this Friday, November the 1st, the same night, at the  Kaufman Concert Hall at the 92nd Street Y.  I'm not performing that.  I'm just doing a talk.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were doing a talk.  Wow.  Or like, you know, an interview thing.  I'm not doing stand-up at that.  Yeah, yeah.  I just don't want anyone to come and be like, well, Norton said you're going to perform.  What happened?  Yeah, yeah.  What the shit?  Fucking Jim.  That one. 
[03:01:00]  The four people.  And don't forget Parser.  That very specific situation happens, too.  I'm happy to see my friend giving a talk in the same place I saw Gene Wilder and Sidney Poitier.  That's, I'm happy to be.  Oh.  How are those?  It must have been fantastic, right?  Gene Wilder was better.  Sidney Poitier was a good talker, but he didn't talk about Hollywood.  He talked about his mother and his upbringing.  And I guess, again, he's so fucking bored.  That would be kind of, you didn't like that?  I didn't mind it, but I wanted to hear more about it.  Because it's so different.  I want to hear him talk about a patch of blue. 
[03:01:30]  But a black actor, and he won the first black Oscar.  Like, I'd be much more interested to hear about the racism he faced in Hollywood.  Guess who's coming to dinner.  Yeah, or his impressions of those roles now.  Because to me, he's not just some douchey actor, like, all right, he made movies.  I'd be interested to hear what it was like for him, and was his perspective any different because he's from the Caribbean.  I would love to have heard that, but whatever.  Wilder, I thought, was amazing.  What a nice man.  He's a lovely man, Gene Wilder.  And Parks and Rec coming back.  There was a weird thing with that.  We went over with, what's his name?  Nick Offerman was on yesterday. 
[03:02:00]  Nick Offerman was on.  He was great.  Yeah, he's a lot of fun.  That guy's the best, man.  First time we met him, he's a cool dude.  Very cool guy.  And he explained the whole Parks and Rec thing, because they blew it out of proportion.  Yeah, that's exactly what we were talking about earlier.  And everyone's like, man, why did you show up here?  It's like, it's not, man.  Those places just need something to write about.  It's the same number of episodes.  They were wrestling for a couple weeks and trying out a few little things, and it's coming back officially November 14th.  More crap, just like we were talking about.  Exactly.  They latch on, make up their own story, and then run with it.  Sam pointed out something I heard on the after show, which was a good point, about Nick Offerman, which you noticed something that we had never seen. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When he started laughing.  He has the same, like, sort of cadence and everything that he does on the show that's, like, so straightforward and serious.  His laugh went like, went like.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he got this cartoony giggle.  Very giddy laugh.  Yeah, yeah.  So, like.  They took it right out.  Yeah, yeah.  He does it, as Ron, every now and then, there's, like, maybe, like, once a season, there's something that makes Ron, like, giddy. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  And when he does that, it's so funny to me.  He's such a great guy.  Like, you know, there are times that are, that whole cast, it's so many great people.  Like, when I go to work sometimes, it's like, man, it's really not going to get better than this.  I've got to cherish this gig while I have it.  That's smart thinking, enjoy the gig while you have it, because everyone thinks the next gig is around the corner, and it's, like, it's smart to enjoy it.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, and, you know, you work on these big shows and movies and things like that, and there's always, usually, someone who's just, like, a real dick. 
[03:03:30]  Painting the ass.  And on this, it's, like, everyone's just great, and you just have a fun time, and I don't know why everyone fucking says, oh, we're all friends, whatever.  Everybody is so wonderful.  It's true.  It's a good group of folks.  I don't like after the show's over, you get the real stories.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, like, Chevy Chase, like, there was rumors that he was awful on, uh, on...  On everything.  Yeah, on everything.  Yeah, that's true.  Exactly, on everything.  That is true.  Oh, what are you kidding me?  We've been hearing that for 25 years. 
[03:04:00]  But it's like, dude, what are you so miserable about?  Like, you know, you're on a, you're an older guy, you've had a long and very, very solid film career and TV career, and you're on another well-respected show.  Like, what's the problem?  Fucking, yeah.  What could be the issue, right?  Just enjoy it.  Yeah.  He's always an issue, from what I hear, but...  Hey, I never worked with him.  What do I know?  Well, we technically did.  We were on the same talk show with him once.  And he was an asshole.  And we were all in the makeup room, and he did not want anything to do with us. 
[03:04:30]  And we weren't even trying.  No, no.  That was the weird part.  We're trying to be cool.  It was the Donnie Deutsch show that we did that never aired.  Well, that's right.  Because they didn't have their shit together.  They were like, they filmed us two weeks in advance, so all the stories changed by the  time they were ready to put it on TV.  Chevy Chase wanted no part of me.  Chevy Chase had a pink sweater on.  Remember that, eh?  Yeah.  Anyway.  No, he was...  I sat behind...  Oh, you were there.  At Book of Mormon.  We went and saw Book of Mormon.  Oh, yeah.  We sat behind Chevy Chase.  And he was laughing his ass off.  He loved it, so... 
[03:05:00]  But he didn't want anyone taking pictures.  No, he was with his family.  So I left him alone.  But me and Sam saw it at Comic-Con that year.  And we had interviewed Josh Gad from Book of Mormon.  And I told him Chevy Chase.  He goes, oh, tell him I said hello.  So we saw Chevy at a fucking...  Like, whatever.  It was at Comic-Con.  So I was chatting with him.  And I was like, oh, yeah.  Josh Gad says hello.  So he's like, oh, cool.  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, we saw you at Book of Mormon.  He goes, oh, that was great.  And then I hit him for a photo.  And he was just like, oh.  He knew that my whole conversation was alive.  That was leading up to the picture. 
[03:05:30]  I've never seen anybody's face change so quickly.  Like, he was enjoying the conversation.  And then he was like, oh, it's one of those.  He got me.  Yeah.  This one person has been calling forever.  We've got to get them on the line.  Hi, who's this?  You know who it is.  Are you sure it was?  It's me.  Hey, it's Ty.  Hello, man.  We're talking to Aziz.  You got anything?  Yeah.  No, I just want to let you know.  Tell Jim Norton this.  We're going to be at the show on Friday.  I'm at the Beacon Theater with Andrew Dice Clay on Friday. 
[03:06:00]  Whoa, that's awesome.  Yeah, I'm happy about that.  Very cool.  It's going to be a great gig.  It's going to be an amazing gig.  It's going to be an awesome venue.  Yeah, it's going to be very good.  Delighted that you'll be there.  She's just gapping over.  Why would you call our radio show to tell us that you're going to be at a Jim Norton show?  No, she's one of our regulars, Aziz.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I just figured I'd call up and let you know.  Oh, why would we care if you were going?  For what purpose?  That's what he asked you.  Did you see what just happened?  Thank you.  Obie goes, why would you call up and ask Jim Norton, or tell Jim Norton you're going 
[03:06:30]  to be at the show?  And she goes, no, no.  I just wanted to call up and tell him I was going to be there.  And let him know.  But he asked you why you would do that.  What could he possibly be doing with that information?  Now he's got that info.  What is he supposed to do with that?  Nothing.  I'm just letting him know that I'm going to be at the show.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, Dye.  Yes.  Chanting fan base.  Marion and I are going to be at the show.  All right.  That's great.  So let's take this one step further. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  You told me.  I've acknowledged the information.  Ball's in your court.  Thank you.  All right.  But what happens with that?  Why does Jim need to know that?  I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm going to be at the show.  Especially because this is like a...  Is there anything more terrifying than Norton's fans?  Oh, man.  And she's just babbling underneath us talking.  Can you show us a photo of this enchantress that we're listening to? 
[03:07:30]  Yes.  Colin, by the way, Colin's obsessed with her.  Yeah.  We all are.  What?  I'm going to change that photo.  Well, it doesn't matter which one you pick.  Trust me.  The Twitter photo is not bad, Dye.  You look a little tired in it, but you're lovely.  No, go to her Twitter account.  Her Twitter photo.  Yeah, where she looks like Babe Ruth.  And Babe Ruth is still living.  Oh, no, no, no, not that one, please.  Babe Ruth, when he gave that speech.  Rawr, rawr, rawr.  I bet. 
[03:08:00]  Okay, go here.  But I wish she would answer the question.  I need to break this down.  Like, why would Jimmy care about that info?  Why do you have to call, like, hopefully a very popular radio show to say that?  She'll never have an answer.  Oh.  Wait, let's see.  I want to see the tweets.  Oh, the tweets?  Oh, they're good.  You got to follow her.  She's amazing on Twitter.  A lot of responses to other people.  Yeah, she's amazing on Twitter.  Her face?  Wait, let me see that Twitter pic again.  A lot of her tweets are, thank you very much.  Thanks again.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're real productive.  Must be so annoying. 
[03:08:30]  I DM those tweets.  Oh, God, imagine getting those.  Yeah.  When you text someone, someone's on the right back.  Cool.  Yeah.  You wasted my life.  Pop that picture of her up, her Twitter picture again.  She almost looks like if Sammy Hagar got stung by bees.  That's a new one.  Yeah, yeah.  We got to write down all the people she looks like.  Oh, yeah.  Of course, throw mama from the train.  My little chickadee.  No, no, no.  Please don't do this.  No, no, no.  I'm going to change that picture. 
[03:09:00]  Why?  It's lovely.  It's not going to make a difference.  Mitch, how did you first get into Jim's stuff?  Where did you first hear about Jim?  When did I first hear about Jim?  The repeat of the question.  She'll do that constantly.  Hold on, hold on.  What?  I've known about Jim Norton for years.  Where did you first see his stuff?  Like on Comedy Central?  Oh, my God.  Did you get a CD?  But he's entertained by this, too. 
[03:09:30]  What?  Back in the WNEW days.  When we were on the radio in NEW back in 19.  Oh, so through the show.  Through the show, she became a fan and blah, blah, blah.  That's how both of us heard about Jim Norton.  You have a friend, Mary, and they're just...  We call him the retarded Laverna and Shirley.  I'm going deep in the hole.  Oh, yeah, you are.  Just stop now before it's like,  Aziz, I'm coming to see you, too.  Oh, she'll be there, yeah.  Make sure you tweet Aziz and tell him how much you love.  She'll stalk you next.  Listen, Lady Di,  I'm going to try one more time. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  You needed to tell Jimmy that you're going to be at the show.  Now, what is he supposed to do with that info?  Nothing.  I just want to let him know that we're going to be there.  Me and Marion and I are going to be there.  Yeah, we know.  So he kind of is a show of...  Marion.  Listen.  Hey, he's like,  Hey, you're doing the show?  We're going to be there to support you?  All right.  Got tickets?  Wait, hold on.  Marion does not have a MiFi.  What's a MiFi?  And MiFi is like the first generation of the satellite radio, right? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  A portable?  Yeah, a portable MiFi.  But why are you wasting our time with this?  Well, I told Marion I was going to call up.  Oh, that doesn't...  I've never heard anybody...  It's uncanny, the ability you have to relay impertinent information.  I've never heard anybody with an ability to tell me such nonsense.  I've learned nothing in like five minutes. 
[03:11:00]  Nothing.  Opie and Anthony, can I ask you a question?  It's like context, like we were discussing earlier, though.  You do understand you're telling a national, hopefully, huge radio audience this stuff.  International.  Canada, too.  No one cares.  But this is like a private phone call.  Right, right.  It's a private phone call.  All right.  She was trying to get a MiFi, so this way she could listen to this.  And then she doesn't even hear what I'm trying to tell her.  Why do we need to hear this now? 
[03:11:30]  We don't care if she can't get a MiFi.  Nobody can get a MiFi.  They stopped making that.  It's in 2006.  All right.  I understand that.  I understand that.  Did you get a job yet?  Did you get a job yet?  No.  Oh.  Why?  I knew this conversation was going to come up.  No, I did not get a job yet.  When did you look?  I've been looking, and I already know where to go, but I just don't bother because I just, 
[03:12:00]  well, let's put it this way.  What way?  I'm taking a break from this job search thing.  If you only understood that deeply.  She has never worked.  She's been looking for a job for 10 years.  She has decided to take a break from the looking for a job thing.  That's like me taking a job for being an astronaut.  Taking a break.  Right, right.  Taking a break.  Taking a job.  Sorry, her yapping through a fucking thing.  Taking a break from being an astronaut. 
[03:12:30]  Wait, wait, hold on.  Why?  Lady Di.  Wait, hold on.  What?  You haven't worked in 10 years or so.  At least.  How are you?  What are you talking about?  No, I did work 10 years ago.  Let's get the facts straight.  I know.  That's what I said.  But you haven't gotten a job.  Why would you take a break from trying to find a job?  Why do I work so hard?  Why? 
[03:13:00]  Why?  Take 10 years off.  And still be alive.  It's amazing.  You could still be alive.  And you could still go to see Jim Norton.  Without working.  It's just working.  It's amazing.  Maybe she's figured everything out.  Yeah, and we're the idiots.  We're the dummies.  Waking up early.  No, no, no, no, no.  Doing a bunch of stand-up.  Who cares?  Take 10 years off.  And then she's got to answer it.  No, no, no.  You guys aren't dummies.  I mean, why don't more people do that?  Where it's like, I'm just going to chill for 10 years.  Not going to do anything.  Not going to work. 
[03:13:30]  Just going to do what I want to do.  That seems like a good deal.  I'm going to chill for 10 years.  Diane, do you understand?  I'm not sure if you understand the dynamics of a conversation.  But as he's just talking or Ope's talking to somebody,  the sounds coming out of their mouth mean they should be entering your ears.  But you're just yapping over everybody.  You're very difficult to have a conversation with.  Who are you?  What do you mean?  Wait, did you...  I don't know who he is.  I'm Jim Norton. 
[03:14:00]  All right, Jim Norton.  You know, the guy that you're going to see Friday  and the reason why you called us to tell us that you're going to see him.  Do you have dementia?  Yeah.  No, I don't have dementia.  Why would you ask who I am when you've known me for 14 years?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, well, that's true, too.  I'm sorry about that.  That's true, too.  Holy shit.  Hold on a second.  What?  I thought maybe you had a comedian in there with you.  We do, Aziz.  We do, and I said that as well. 
[03:14:30]  What is his name?  I said Aziz.  That's how this whole thing started.  I said we have Aziz in.  Do you have anything to ask him?  Aziz Ansari.  He's a comedian.  Okay.  Do you know?  I mean, I don't know what to say.  How about hello?  Do you know who he is?  Well, no.  Well, now I know who he is.  How about you say hi?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  All right.  How you doing?  I covered that already.  Was that you, Jimmy?  No. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  You're a disaster.  What are you doing?  I'm confused.  Yeah, no shit.  Are you drinking this morning?  She's a big drinker.  What did you have this morning?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  It's not even 10 in the morning.  Well, that's why she's giving up that job, sir.  What are you having this morning?  Natural life.  Natural life.  She's drinking some Natty.  Natty lights, motherfucker. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, she's drinking in the morning.  It's natural.  She's Natty.  By the way, anyone out there working, you're all suckers and saps.  Yeah.  Ten years off.  And rubes.  Yeah.  Crack open a crisp Natty light.  Natty.  That's it.  9.45 a.m.  Oh, my God.  What time did you wake up this morning?  That's a lie.  Dear.  What time did I wake up?  Yes.  Around 6 o'clock.  What time?  And don't lie now.  We're all friends.  What time did you have your first alcoholic beverage?  Crack that first beer.  What time?  Tell the truth.  This is my second one. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, no.  Do you drink fast?  It's getting dark.  What?  No.  It's my second one.  How many are you going to have?  What time did you crack it?  I just cracked it.  No.  What time did you crack the first beer?  The first one?  About a half hour ago.  Maybe an hour?  No.  About an hour ago.  All right.  9.  9 a.m.  You start drinking on a Tuesday.  What did you do between 6 and 9? 
[03:16:30]  Well, I had to.  Let me see.  I washed up.  I brushed my teeth.  All right.  There's two minutes.  For three hours?  I was on the phone for three hours trying to get in touch with you guys.  Oh, wow.  That is true.  So she sat.  That's why I finally took her call.  She sat on hold.  More or less.  Or trying to call in.  Off and on.  For three hours.  Just to tell.  To relay the information that she's going to the show.  Right.  Now I'm not sure you have anything figured out, Ty.  I thought you had a whole plan worked out. 
[03:17:00]  The whole, like, 10-year breather.  She waited.  I was on board.  Now I'm not so sure.  Yeah.  She waited three hours to tell Jimmy that she's going to be at the show Friday with Marion.  I mean, there is a conceivable.  I can't even wrap my head around that.  There's a conceivable reality where she waits three hours.  Calls and says, waiting for three hours.  Just, hey, Jim, I'm going to be on the show.  All right, cool.  Bye.  That's it.  And that's it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It must be a wonderful thing to live like that.  Ty, I got to ask you. 
[03:17:30]  Why have you given up the job search?  Oh, no, no.  I'm just taking a little break from it.  Well, yes.  Why are you taking a break?  I did not give up.  I'm just taking a break.  Why are you taking a break?  Because, well, let me tell you something right now.  Because, I'm taking a break because it seems to me like a lot of people do not want to hire people that are over 50 years old.  And I'm over 50.  Do you understand?  Yes.  Wow, she's giving us a talking show. 
[03:18:00]  So, taking a break, what are you going to get, younger?  What was the excuse when you were 40?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  I was working when I was 40 years old.  Opie, you don't remember?  Yeah, it was 10 years ago when you were working.  What do you think people like to hire less?  50-year-olds or women who wake up at 9 o'clock in the morning and start drinking Natty Light?  Exactly.  You're living a rap video.  You got the beer wrong.  Anthony, you got the beer wrong.  It's Natty Ice. 
[03:18:30]  Natty Ice!  All right, we got the natural ice.  Natty Ice.  Natty Ice.  Natty Light.  Oh, no thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  Is it a can or a bottle?  It's a little bit stronger than Natty Light.  A little strong, but good.  You got to get a little of that ice action, right?  Natty Ice.  Hey, is it a, uh, Di, is it a can or a bottle?  A little break.  Uh, what?  A can.  Of course.  Just cracking that, that warm, that piss-warm can and Natty Ice. 
[03:19:00]  Natty Ice.  They're not warm.  Oh, okay.  Good, good.  Yeah, they're cold.  That's great.  So now, why do you think that people don't want to hire 50-year-old women, right?  Right.  Uh, but why...  I look like Babe Ruth.  Hey, hey, hey, listen up, listen up.  You don't think people want to hire, so you're going to take a break and wait for more time  to pass by.  That problem isn't going to solve itself by adding more time to it.  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, you know, this whole thing with the computers and stuff like that, that's kind 
[03:19:30]  of difficult.  To get on a computer...  Well, you could have spent the last three hours learning something about it.  Right.  Yeah, I know, I know.  I have my computer...  They're not that difficult.  I got a three-year-old that's rocking the computer.  A girl or a boy?  Oh, Jesus.  Wait, at least you grasped the really important part of the discussion.  Lady Di, Lady Di, Lady Di, listen to me.  Where was the last place and when that you tried to get a job? 
[03:20:00]  Family Dollar.  She said she was in here.  That was...  That's a long time ago.  That was months ago.  Yeah, whenever I made that video.  Family Dollar, isn't that chain gone?  I think so, like Blockbuster.  I saw one of those in South Carolina, like, 15 years ago.  Yeah, it's still there.  All right, it's still there.  Family Dollar still around?  Family...  You live in New York?  Family Dollar?  She's picking up obscure places.  Corvettes.  Corvettes. 
[03:20:30]  Clines.  Elizabeth, New Jersey.  Elizabeth, New Jersey.  All right.  Good.  Lady Di, so you haven't looked for a job in months.  No, try one month.  No, no, no.  When you...  You were on this very show months ago talking about the dollar store.  Yeah.  That was months ago.  May.  May.  You just told me.  It was May.  June, July.  I was, what, six months ago almost? 
[03:21:00]  Six months ago was the dollar store.  Remember the day you had that discharge?  Di, it was six months ago that you haven't looked for a job.  Right.  Okay, why?  Are you coming to the show?  Now you're making me lie?  No, it was that month.  It was June.  No, it wasn't.  Isn't June pretty close to May, which makes our point still?  Yeah, yeah.  That it's been a while? 
[03:21:30]  Certainly out of the one month time frame that she gave.  So isn't...  How long of a break are you going to take?  It's already six months.  How long of a break are you going to take from looking for work?  I don't know.  A couple more weeks.  Let's put it that way.  A couple more weeks.  And then...  What a wonderful way to live.  It's amazing.  She's just sipping...  God, I wish I could do this.  Sipping beer.  Not a worry in the world.  Not working.  Got some natties.  Getting on the phone.  Going to see Jim Norton November 1st.  Could kill three hours just to tell Jimmy that they're going to the show. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  Andrew Dice Clay, right?  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.  Myself and Dice Clay.  How are you getting the money for the ticket?  Yeah, Di, how much of your dad's will are you going through?  Oh, my God.  Don't even mention that.  How much have you gone through?  How much have I gone through?  That was the question.  I try to keep it on a minimum basis.  Let's put it that way. 
[03:22:30]  By not working and by drinking Natty Ice and going to see Jim Norton.  Oh, don't forget, I'm going to go see Michael Nesmith, too.  November 2nd.  We don't care.  She calls it every month, lets you know what show she's going to.  She's a huge Monkees fan.  On...  Huge.  Oh, is that who Michael Nesmith is?  Yeah, so the Monkees.  She loves the Monkees.  Give us a little Monkees for Aziz.  So we don't feel like we've wasted his time.  What do you want me to say about the Monkees? 
[03:23:00]  Sing one of the Monkees songs.  I thought...  No, no, no.  I better not sing that again.  Let me see.  Again.  Oh, boy.  Another Monkees song.  You sound like a real fanatic.  Big fan, yeah.  Yeah.  Walking down the street.  We get the funniest looks from...  Bet you do.  ...where we meet.  Hey, hey, we're the drunkies.  I knew you were going to do that. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, you knew?  Did ya?  Right now she's standing barefoot in big grandma panties with a t-shirt and a fucking beer.  Slugging out of a beer.  Natty Ice.  Natty Ice.  You can't get over that, right?  You can't get over that, right?  9A.  Oh, man.  What a life.  Go over to Budden and start working for them again.  Lady Di, do you have a Halloween costume?  Um, no.  I'm the Halloween costume.  Oh, boy.  Are you going to Anthony's party?  No, I'm not.  You are invited.  You and Marianne are both invited to Anthony's big shindig. 
[03:24:00]  Yep.  I don't think so.  What's the address?  If you stay on hold, we'll get you that.  Can you call tomorrow and let us know for sure you're going?  Yeah, please.  We're not going to the party.  Why not?  Because we don't want to go.  I think I want this drunk buffoon at my party.  She'd be the head of the party.  She would be wonderful.  Everyone would hit her.  Yeah.  All right, Lady Di.  It's been terrific. 
[03:24:30]  You're a delight.  You are.  Good to meet you.  Good to meet you.  You too.  All right.  Lady Di, go get a job.  All right.  Be careful.  I sure will.  You're just languishing in a sea of delusion and alcoholism.  Jimmy, I'll see you on Friday.  I know.  I appreciate you coming, Di.  Just stop drinking.  And so will Marianne, too.  I know.  I understand.  We know she's going.  Okay.  She can speak for herself, though. 
[03:25:00]  That fucking inheritance is like one of those, what do they call that thing?  The little sand-clocky thing?  The hourglass.  Thank you.  Sand-clocky.  Hourglass.  Hourglass.  All that money that her dad worked his entire life for and then, you know, passed on to another  world and gave Di the money instead of, you know, maybe taking care of her son with it.  She's buying Natty Ice.  You going to see Michael Nesmith? 
[03:25:30]  Yes, I am.  Jerry said goodbye.  In Englewood.  Wow, that's pretty impressive.  Where are your seats?  Oh, yeah.  What is Michael Nesmith going to do?  He doesn't sing any of the Monkees' songs.  Yes, he does.  No.  He has to sing now that the other guy is dead.  He doesn't sing.  He wasn't the singer in the Monkees.  But the singer's dead, so. 
[03:26:00]  He was one of them.  What?  He was one of them.  No.  What songs did he sing?  He sang a couple of the really bad ones that no one knows.  I don't know them all.  He didn't sing Daydream Believer.  No, no, no.  That was Davy Jones.  Yeah.  I already know about that.  Yeah, I already know about that.  Yeah, of course you know about it.  There wasn't a rumor that was confirmed.  Oh, no.  She's so terrible.  All right.  I met Davy Jones years ago.  All right.  I hope you meet him again soon. 
[03:26:30]  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  We got to let you go for real.  Goodbye, Dye.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  It's 10.09?  Jesus.  What?  It's 10 after 10.  That went fast.  I hope you enjoyed that, Aziz.  We did that for you.  Aziz.  Very interesting.  Yeah, with Colin Quinn can't get enough of her.  Oh, Colin loves her.  And her friend, Marion.  Yeah, he's a bit obsessed with her and Marion.  Yeah.  Marion is just as trippy.  Let me tell you, that was a great call by Lady Di. 
[03:27:00]  Huh?  That was a great call.  I think so.  It was hilarious.  When she's, who are you?  Holy shit.  That's the whole reason why you called.  Holy fuck.  And let's properly plug everything here.  Yes.  Aziz has his special Buried Alive streaming on Netflix.  Starts Friday, November the 1st.

[03:33:00]  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Oh, my God.  I don't even think Sal was alive when they made my fives.  That call from Lady Died today just made my day.  Oh.  That woman's entertainment knows no ends.  I don't know if you were listening to the last segment here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:33:30]  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number if you want to chime in, because I'd love to hear what the audience response was.  But on what planet?  Okay.  We got Aziz Ansari in here, right?  And he's a legitimate big star at this point.  He's got...  Sal was telling me over 3 million followers on Twitter.  He's on Parks and Rec.  Biggest show there is.  He's doing the Louis C.K.  Put your comedy special on your website and charge $5 for it model. 
[03:34:00]  That only works if you're ridiculously successful.  And it's working for him.  Okay.  This guy is super famous at this point.  He hangs out with Jay-Z and Kanye West, like, at their house.  Like, he's the guy who's making cameos in rappers' music videos as, yeah, this is my famous friend, Aziz, that just hangs out with us.  He has no role or purpose here.  But we put him in the video because he's cool.  I'm sure at one point Kanye West told Aziz about leather jogging pants before he told Jimmy Kimmel about it. 
[03:34:30]  Aziz probably knew Kanye was pissed off about that from way back in the day because they're boys.  That's how famous Aziz Ansari is.  On what planet does Lady Di and her bullshit get to infect the life of a star like Aziz?  You know what I mean?  Like, on what planet would you think that Aziz...  Because he was sitting here and he's a nice guy. 
[03:35:00]  He's super nice.  And he was trying to be like, I'm sure that there is something endearing about this woman.  I'm sure that there is something to this woman that makes her life worth living.  And he's asking her about a Halloween costume and he's saying, nice to meet you.  And he's, you know, how are you doing?  And he's being polite.  But even Aziz got frustrated to the point where he's sitting there going, I've been working my ass off throughout my entire youth.  As I, you know, throughout my 20s, into my 30s. 
[03:35:30]  Busting my ass to try to be good at something.  To try to be successful at something.  And then you have Lady Di calling in who's taken 10 years off of working so she can sit at home, drink natty ice at 9 o'clock in the morning and call up a show to announce to a comedian that she'll be in the audience.  Even Aziz at that point was like, I don't know what I'm doing anymore.  Apparently this is the way a person lives their life. 
[03:36:00]  How did she achieve anything in life that she could actually have an effect on that dude?  Let me go to Nick in Tennessee.  What's up, Nick?  Hey, what's up, Prime Sime?  Did you just call me Prime Sime?  I did.  I called you Prime Sime.  That was one of those, I think you said Prime Sime.  I think it was one of those Brian Regan things where you were going to say Prime Sime and then you thought better of it and you were going to say Sam and then Prime Sime happens.  That's very true.  Well, you know, we have a comment, man. 
[03:36:30]  My last name's Samara.  My middle name is Roberts.  Love it.  So we have something in common.  Love it.  Anyways, man, I wanted to thank you.  You sent me a Blu-ray last week of Pacific Rim.  That was pretty cool, man.  Oh, yeah, you got it.  Yeah, I got it.  And Lady Di is a fucking train wreck, man.  You can't call her a train wreck because if you've forgotten, her ex-husband was so tired of her that he jumped in front of one.  So you don't want to say he caused a train wreck.  But, yeah, I mean, when she responded to the question, I don't remember if it was Ant or Jim who asked her, have you been drinking this morning? 
[03:37:00]  And she said, yeah, I've had a couple drinks.  Yeah, I'm drinking natural ice.  Like, that's how you know, she's not even drinking Natty Ice, ironically, the way a frat boy does it, the way college kids drink it because it's funny.  She's drinking it the way somebody who calls it natural ice drinks it.  Like, that's the beer that she chose because it's cheap.  But it's still pretty good.  It still tastes good. 
[03:37:30]  It tastes like beer, you know?  Natty Ice.  It's expensive and it tastes wonderful.  Yeah, exactly.  Especially early in the morning.  Thanks, Nick.  It's good, man.  Sorry, buddy.  It's good.  Yeah, yeah.  She's quitting coffee.  Just like Opie.  Opie said this morning, he's quitting coffee.  So does Lady Di.  She's taking up Natty Ice instead.  The best line of today, actually, me and Eric picked up on it, was Anko.  In her photo, she looks like Sammy Hagar with bee stings all over her face.  She does.  What's her Twitter address?  Do you have it up there? 
[03:38:00]  It's so complicated.  I get stressed out because I sit at the computer while the show's on and I get stressed out  because they ask me to pull up a picture of Lady Di and her Twitter name is impossible  to remember.  She's decided to pick the worst name in all of Twitter.  What is her Twitter name, Sal?  Diana or Bonnie 777.  So everybody should follow Diana or Bonnie 777 on Twitter and just see this photo that  as Ant so eloquently put it, looks like Sammy Hagar got stung by a bunch of bees in the 
[03:38:30]  face.  Jason in Detroit.  Hey, Sam.  I know you're a wrestling fan.  I've got to ask, do you think this is any kind of work with her?  No, dude.  I've had conversations with her.  I mean, you remember, she's been on the show for years, okay?  And you remember, she returned to the show by calling in to this show after Open Anthony  Live.  And I talked to her for like 35, 40 minutes that day. 
[03:39:00]  And it was not, and then she came in and she was on the air.  She had a vaginal discharge on the air.  That's what kind of train wreck she is.  She's, she's a woman.  She's 50 years old, right?  And not proud of being 50.  Not Molly Shannon in, on SNL.  She's 50 and appears to be in her late 70s.  Like she is horrible.  And she sits there and she realizes something's going on in her pants.  This was about six months ago.  And she whispers into the microphone for some reason, I think my, my monthly is coming 
[03:39:30]  to visit.  Or I think my friend's visiting.  Yeah.  Like she thinks at 50, her period is starting over.  And then she comes back into, this is the train wreck we're dealing with.  She comes back into the studio and we go, lady, die, what happened?  And she goes, oh no, no.  It was just a discharge.  It was just a discharge.  I've never even heard that phrase before.  I didn't know that happened.  A woman has never come to me and said, no, it was nothing to worry about.  It was just a discharge. 
[03:40:00]  She'd say, I would sooner hear a woman say, no, I just had to drop a hot shit.  Then no, it was just a discharge.  You know what I mean?  And so no, and then, and then, and then we talked to her off the air.  I had conversations with her off the air.  There is no work.  There is no wrestling gimmick to this woman.  This is a woman who's been sitting at home since we last heard her six months ago, drinking  natty ice, watching reruns of the monkeys and thinking about when she's going to call 
[03:40:30]  the Opie and Anthony show so she can tell Jim that she's going to see him.  That's it.  That's it.  Oh Christ.  You're the best, fam.  Thanks, Jason.  One of the hardest laughs I've ever had here was the day that Bobo, Marion, and Lady Di  were all here.  It was just like the sideshow of it all.  It's so weird.  Dude, it was the funniest fucking thing.  That was six months ago.  That's when we last heard from Lady Di.  They should do it again, but throw like some sort of a wrench into it.  Colin Quinn would be the wrench. 
[03:41:00]  Well, no, Colin was here that day.  Colin was here that day, yeah, yeah.  And that's the other funny thing.  Colin Quinn loves this woman.  Colin, that's why I like Colin, because he loves the freaks that come on this show.  Anything that has to do with Bobo, anything that has to do with this train wreck we heard  from today, Lady Di, he is all in.  He's got a big heart, you know?  He's got something.  Or he's a glutton for punishment.  That's it.  Uh, Tom.  Hey, morning, Sam.  What's up, buddy? 
[03:41:30]  I think Ant owes Sammy Hague our apology.  The man has done nothing but bring us good music his entire life.  Maybe you're right.  And I think a Valanche comparison would have been more important.  Something along the lines of Valanche.  Well, you know what?  It's a much more, uh, the picture, if you look at Diana Orbani777 on Twitter, that's Lady Di,  who we talked to today, her haircut is much more of a Bruce Valanche haircut.  The style, I mean.  I would agree.  And look at poor Sammy gets straight into this. 
[03:42:00]  All he's trying to do is sell a little bit of rum, a little bit of weed, run down Van Halen  a little bit, and what's not to love?  What's not to love?  You're right.  Maybe he should apologize to Sammy.  Sammy's just trying to get his cabalwabo out there.  Quinn in Louisiana.  California, you mean?  L.A.  I take a guess sometimes.  Uh, all right.  I'm just going to say, the show was great today, man.  I missed the end of Jocktober, but.  Yeah, I mean, it's rare that something can come in, when we stop Jocktober short, it's 
[03:42:30]  rare that something can come in and save that, but Lady Di does it again.  And also the Bobo one with Lady Di was the best fucking thing.  I mean, there's nothing, there's nothing better than Lady Di.  I like today because I really enjoyed seeing Aziz, who just lives his life on positive terms.  You know what I mean?  He likes having people around him that he likes.  He likes being able to say nice things to people, and for people to say nice things to  him, all this seedy underbelly of planet Earth that the Obi and Anthony show exists in, doesn't 
[03:43:00]  happen in Aziz's world, okay?  There is no Lady Di and Marion and Bobo and these fucking wrecks who obsess over this show  and stalker patties.  None of these people exist in Aziz's world.  He's made it that way.  He's become successful to a point that he doesn't have to deal with this nonsense anymore.  And for her to come on and infect his life with her bullshit of sitting at home at nine 
[03:43:30]  o'clock in the morning drinking Natty Ice and watching Monkeys reruns is preposterous  and hilarious.  Kevin in Houston.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  I just, I can't even describe how mad I am right now.  Like, having to go to work and bust my ass and take care of my family, and for this  worthless pile of dog shit to sit around.  Ten years, dude.  I mean, I, I, that's why I have no feeling for people anymore. 
[03:44:00]  It's because of people like her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's enough, it's, she's, she, Lady Di is enough to turn you off of the entire  human race.  Later, Sam.  Later, buddy.  Like, if aliens came to this planet, and it was like ID4, and Will Smith was like,  holy shit, why is that spaceship blowing up the White House?  And the aliens came to Will Smith and said, well, we met Lady Di, it was the first person  that we met.  I would assume Will Smith would be like, do your, do what you gotta do then. 
[03:44:30]  I understand why you want the human race to be extinct right now.  And you go to Lady Trucker.  What's up, Lady Trucker?  This is, I mean, Lady Di makes Lady Trucker look like a pleasant human being.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but Lady Di is just such an evil drunk tart.  I mean, she's telling Jimmy, hey, I'm going to your show, and then she's, you know, yelling,  who are you?  Yeah, it's, it's insane.  Come on in, Nicole.  You missed, you missed a great show.  Aziz and Zari was here. 
[03:45:00]  Aw!  On your show or ONA?  On ONA.  And Lady Di called in.  You remember Lady Di from Lady Di and Marion?  Not the one who drove into a wall.  Lady Di, our Lady Di from Lady Di and Marion.  Okay.  I have no idea what you're talking about, but whatever.  She was a bit, you met her like six months ago.  It was the two of them.  Opie made a twerking video with them.  This, this lovely woman right here.  I was just going to say, who's that scary woman?  That would be Lady Di.  Hello, Lady Di.  Now, Nicole, I don't know.  Before we start anything, I want to tell you about Russell Peters.  You know about him?  No, I don't know about Russell Peters. 
[03:45:30]  He just happens to be one of the biggest stand-up comedians in the world.  Oh, really?  And he's got a brand new comedy special.  You don't say.  It's called Notorious.  It's premiering exclusively on Netflix.  The hour-long special was shot on Russell's recent world tour and is the newest comedy special from Netflix.  If you haven't already checked it out, you really have to.  Notorious is not to be missed.  Russell has been doing stand-up for over 20 years since he was 19.  Wow.  He sells out arenas all over the world.  He has nearly a million Facebook fans.  And his YouTube videos have over 75 million hits. 
[03:46:00]  That makes Apple Phone 5 look like child's play.  Entertainment Weekly calls his new special Notorious funny and risque.  Oh.  Netflix is also launching an exclusive four-part series, Russell Peters vs. the World, which takes you behind the scenes during the Notorious tour.  So don't miss Notorious and Russell Peters vs. the World, now streaming on Netflix.  Just something I've been meaning to tell you.  You know what?  Thank you.  I feel like I've filled in now. 
[03:46:30]  Right.  Now, Nicole.  Yeah.  You came on.  Yeah.  After Open Anthony Live on Friday.  I know.  I feel like they're mad at me.  And you announced to the world that you're expecting a child.  Yeah.  A girl.  A girl.  This is exciting news.  I know.  Now?  Yeah.  I don't know what's going on.  I know.  But you make this a whole family event for the first time ever.  Now, you've told a lot of stories on this show.  Yes, I have.  We've talked about your partying days.  Uh-huh.  We've talked about your many sexual exploits.  Yes.  Uh, with your husband, before your husband, I'm assuming not during your time with your 
[03:47:00]  husband.  I mean.  I don't know.  No.  We don't know for sure.  We don't know.  We haven't gotten there.  But for the first time ever on the Open Anthony channel, your husband is here.  Yes.  Holy cow.  Mr. Matt Biggins is here.  Easy guy.  Easy.  What are you doing here?  I'm just conducting some business, Sam.  Yeah?  As usual.  You look like you're conducting business.  You've got your suit that fits on.  Well, it's a blazer.  Yeah.  We'll get there.  You got pants? 
[03:47:30]  No.  Okay.  Pantless day.  It's serious.  I'm glad you're here, actually, Matt.  I'm glad you're here, Nicole, too.  Yeah.  Because there's something that I haven't been meaning to address.  Eric, you in there?  Who's in there?  Yeah, I'm here.  Get Denny up here.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Don't.  Let's not do this.  No, I want to talk to him.  I don't want to do this.  It's a weird thing.  I know it's weird.  What do I have to do?  I want to talk to Denny.  Have you met Denny, Matt?  I don't know.  So what?  You're up here just conducting some business with the company, and you thought you'd stop  in and say hello?  I wanted to see my favorite radio DJ.  Where is he?  I'm just kidding.  I know it's me. 
[03:48:00]  Actually, it's Stan.  Oh, yeah.  I bet it's Stan from the morning mashup.  You know Stan's not here because he took the week off because it's his birthday.  No, it's not.  It's his birthday.  It's his birthday.  He took the week off because he's a man of a certain age at this point.  He's 12 years old, apparently.  How do you feel, first of all, Matt, about when your wife comes on the show and explains  some of her more private moments?  I feel very proud.  You do?  You do?  You're proud?  Yeah.  I was the one that locked down the real girl that we all know and love, Nicole.  Right, right, right. 
[03:48:30]  Do you hear a lot of the real girl that you all know and love?  I met her at a bathroom stall.  Okay, so it's not a surprise.  Nothing's going to shock me.  In a bar at 3 a.m.  In a bathroom stall.  And she called, actually, yeah.  It was super romantic.  Is that where you were intimate together for the first time?  That's where the baby was made.  Oh, stop.  That's beautiful.  That's beautiful.  It's been a gestation for five years.  Speaking of the baby, Dennis.  The baby.  How are you?  Good, how are you doing?  Matt, do you know Dennis Falcone?  Dennis, pleasure.  How are you, buddy?  Dennis has been in the radio business for quite some time.  He worships the radio business.  He's as old school as they come. 
[03:49:00]  He loves, he's all about, as he says, he's theater of the mind.  Yes.  Is that right, Dennis?  That's right.  And he's all about talking to your audience because, as far as he's concerned, the one guy  listening, that's a friend.  You have a relationship.  Is that right, Dennis?  Exactly.  Exactly.  You're not talking to everybody out there in radio land.  You're talking to that one person, one listener at a time.  You never talk to me, Dennis.  When I'm sitting there and I'm talking to Nicole about having sex on a beach while a  strange Mexican man watches her, I'm actually talking to her husband. 
[03:49:30]  That was her father.  I didn't know, Nicole, you didn't tell me that.  No, it's not my father.  You guys haven't heard that one?  Watching or participating?  He was the picture taker.  Oh, okay.  So it's not weird.  No.  It's all lies.  He's poured into me.  Here's the weird part.  So Nicole comes on this show on Friday.  By the way, I have to compliment you on your sense of humor about everything.  Thank you very much.  But now we're going to test it.  It's nice to meet you.  Now we're going to test it because Nicole comes on this show on Friday.  She announces to the world that she's pregnant, right? 
[03:50:00]  And she leaves the studio.  And right down the hall, 45 seconds after leaving the air, was Dennis Falcone the first  person you talked to after you got off the air?  I believe he was the first person I spoke to.  Now, Nicole, I want you to tell me how the conversation went.  What was the first thing that Dennis said to you after you got off the air announcing  you were pregnant?  I need to first preface this by saying I believe it was out of love.  But he did tell me a story about a woman years and years ago who he didn't feel should 
[03:50:30]  announce that she was pregnant on the air because when she did finally give birth, it  was dead.  What?  No, no.  It was a guy I worked with.  What?  It was a guy I worked with.  Let me tell you the story.  This is a guy I worked with, right?  And at the time, I was a program director at the station.  Let me give you the story.  Yeah.  And he said, hey, my wife is pregnant.  I said, well, make sure you don't talk about it on the air.  I said, why?  Now, you're telling Nicole this story immediately after announcing she's pregnant.  I knew she was pregnant.  I said, congratulations.  But immediately after announcing on the air. 
[03:51:00]  You were talking about it on the air.  Yeah.  So I said, whatever you do, don't talk about it on the air.  Why, why, why, why?  I said, well, just don't talk about it.  Just in case something, you know, it's like saying, hey, I'm getting married, getting married.  And then all of a sudden, you're not getting married.  And it's like, well, it's not a happy ending.  You're saying good times and great oldies.  So you're a cup half full kind of guy, huh?  To mention the good times and the great oldies.  Don't talk about it until the baby is born.  Then you say, hey, by the way, congratulations to my wife.  We just had a new member of the family.  Fine. 
[03:51:30]  So you said, okay, fine.  Before we even know the ending of the story, Nicole's looking at you going, okay, well,  this advice doesn't help being that I just announced on the air.  Okay, but go on.  And the conclusion of the story.  And you don't know if the program director of the radio station that she worked for wanted  her to announce that on the air.  I don't know if it was discussed.  Oh, yes, we do.  We did not.  It was discussed, and he gave me the go-ahead and told me to share it with the world.  And he was fearful for some reasons.  What was the conclusion of the story?  Well, they had a healthy baby.  Fantastic.  Oh, great.  So I left the station. 
[03:52:00]  His wife is expecting another child.  Oh, beautiful.  Exactly.  Not beautiful.  He's on the air talking about it every day.  Hey, my wife just did this.  My wife went there.  My wife went to the doctor.  Because it's a process people can relate to.  It's beautiful.  It's nice.  Well, sad to say.  Sad to say what?  Sad to say the baby was what?  Stillborn.  Stillborn.  Yeah.  So it was not good times and good.  Oh, my wife walked the baby.  He just said stillborn.  He just said stillborn like a radio guy.  Hashtag stillborn.  You just said stillborn. 
[03:52:30]  He could not play Be My Baby by the Ronettes.  You just said stillborn like it was the artist for this Two for Tuesday.  Stillborn coming at you.  I'm just telling you like it is, right?  That's what you guys say?  Tell it like it is.  You're right, Danny.  You're right, Danny.  But do you think that maybe there was some tact that could be used that most, like Nicole  is not.  Tact?  You talk to her about having sex on a beach and her husband's here and you're talking  about, you know.  The baby was made face down, ass up.  That's the way she likes to fuck.  Now, but I have to.  You're talking tact?  I have to ask you, Danny. 
[03:53:00]  You're not me, though.  No, of course not.  Okay?  No.  And I would think as a human being, off the air specifically, because there are things  that I'll say on the air that, you know, once you get off the air, it's like, you're  not entertaining people, Sam.  Like, you're just hurting me now.  That's right.  Like, you're just hurting me for your own enjoyment.  So you're a different Sam off the air than you are on the air.  I mean, I try not to be as brutal off the air.  I try.  No, you're pretty brutal off the air.  Well, to you, maybe, because you do things like this, Dennis.  Because do you think that maybe...  Just talk to her for advice.  When a woman is pregnant... 
[03:53:30]  The advice is don't have a stillborn baby.  Yes.  Thank you.  We got it.  When a woman is pregnant...  Nicole is not your typical girl, and that's fine.  But most women don't even want to hear the word stillborn.  No.  Actually, you're the first person who said it to me.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate you for opening my eyes to child death.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Like...  No, it wasn't meant like that.  It was meant from the heart.  It was meant from the heart.  Like, I know...  I know my wife...  Like, Nicole is somehow taking it with a grain of salt and saying, no, he didn't mean anything. 
[03:54:00]  But I know for a fact that if anybody said anything to that, like that to my wife, if she was pregnant, she would be furious.  She would come home screaming.  No, she wouldn't.  You're not looking at it...  Absolutely, she wouldn't.  You're not looking at it the way it was meant.  It was meant...  I'm surprised you were able to talk about it on the air, because that's what a program director wants to tell me.  Do you know what happened?  Do you know how good that radio would be if the child, God forbid, was stillborn?  Oh, Jesus.  Well, we would definitely bring it up here.  That would be big time news.  I'd give you a week.  We'd make TMZ, finally. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  There wasn't any harm meant there.  I know there wasn't any harm meant.  No, I did not.  But you understand that it was a harmful statement to make.  Like, here's an example.  It's like saying I could have gotten AIDS by making the baby having sex in the cold.  What have you...  Like, why don't you bring up crib death?  Why don't you say, give it a year, because there's crib death.  No, no, that's ridiculous.  Oh, it is.  That's crazy.  That doesn't happen.  Yeah, that didn't happen to a co-worker.  It's crazy.  Plus, the thing is, also, there's a lot of guys out there who think she's still...  She shouldn't be. 
[03:55:00]  I would even announce that she was married, because she could still be that wild...  She's not on porn radio.  Yeah, this is bullshit, Danny.  People like real human beings on the air.  That seems to be a thought around...  Back in the days of the WMCA good guys, all the disc jockeys were on the air.  They were supposed to be these wild single bachelors, so everybody just...  But it doesn't matter, because she's talking about being married and pregnant.  What do we talk about?  Getting jizzed on her belly.  Yeah, I would have rewound it.  I wouldn't even say don't talk about being married.  Getting jizzed on her pregnant belly.  I did knock that off my bucket list.  See, and people like that type of talk, Dennis. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  People like that.  You know, when Jess and me were getting married...  Jess and I.  You're right, Danny.  I used to run...  No, no, no, you're right.  You're already a professional broadcaster.  I appreciate the correction, because you're right.  And I try to maintain professionalism at all costs.  Yes.  When Jess and I were getting married, we were leaving the apartment building to get married  separately.  Jess, on her way out, one of our...  Like, the guy who works for the super, the maintenance dude.  He goes, oh, you're going to get married?  And Jess goes, yeah. 
[03:56:00]  And he goes, oh, good luck.  I hope it doesn't fuck your life up.  Yeah, that was the same exact kind of comment.  And he's saying...  He's a funster.  I don't know what that means.  I don't know if it's an ethnic thing.  He is Hispanic, I don't know.  He was probably joking around.  He wasn't.  No.  And regardless...  Well, maybe it messed up his life.  He was saying a positive thing, right?  I hope it doesn't fuck up your life.  Right.  But the statement implies...  You just said it kind of backwards.  Inverted.  ...that this act could result in her life getting fucked up.  There's nothing she can do now. 
[03:56:30]  Now, Nicole has already announced this on the air.  And all you did was put a thought into her head, like, hey, imagine if the baby's stillborn.  No, no.  And it's like, why would you do that to a human being?  She did come home crying.  She did, didn't she?  No, I didn't.  No, she didn't.  No, I didn't.  She knows I compliment her every day.  Yeah, she's very sweet.  Do you see how that's not a great statement to make?  No, I don't have a problem with it.  You still don't agree that that was not the right tack to take?  No, I don't think there was anything wrong with it.  I don't see anything wrong with it either.  You don't, man.  I agree to disagree.  No. 
[03:57:00]  You think that bringing up the moment after a woman announces her pregnancy to the world...  Because let's be honest, you're not sitting to the mashup, but you came on...  Am I supposed to say yes so I don't sound like an asshole?  No, but I think that stillborn jokes are hysterical.  He wasn't...  And he wasn't even joking, which makes it amazing.  It's reality radio, right, Sam?  It wasn't radio, it was a hallway conversation between co-workers.  Jay-Z told Kanye that his baby could die dead.  Yeah.  Reborn dead.  Reborn dead, yeah.  Hey, Kanye, I know you're a public guy and all, but just so you know, that baby could 
[03:57:30]  be stillborn.  She'll still have that fat ass, but that baby could be stillborn.  Like, I don't think Kanye would have been like, you're right, Jay.  You're my dog.  Good point.  I didn't think about that.  No.  He'd be like, why would you even bring it up?  Like, obviously, that's something everybody knows that that's a possibility, but we don't  talk about it because it's a very negative thing.  Listen, Sam's very clearly very protective, which I love about him.  So I'm really okay with it.  We can move on from it.  That's all right.  I understand where you can't.  I'm not only...  You can't.  You can't. 
[03:58:00]  Your husband can't.  Yes.  Nicole can't.  Absolutely not.  I am furious.  Not...  I'm not so much...  Yeah, I'm protective, but at the same time, I'm also perplexed as to how this could happen.  This, to me, is not so much so I can reprimand you.  It's a study of human psychology as to how...  Like, in what context would a person ever think that this was okay to do?  It's just that Harry Birch was just an unwritten rule in radio that you wouldn't talk about  a lot of things like that.  When you...  Just because of... 
[03:58:30]  Stillborn.  No, I understand.  No, because of stillborn.  No, that's right, because that's the example you gave.  The only thing that could go wrong is stillborn.  That's the last thing.  Everything is great.  It has two hands, two feet.  Yeah, I mean, you waited the appropriate amount of time, correct?  Yeah, I mean, I'm five and a half months now.  You know the gender.  No risk.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  We're smooth sailing from here on out.  But she hasn't had a drink in two weeks.  Hours.  Hours.  Drinking with Lady Di.  Hours.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's having that nanny ice to wake her up.  Nanny ice.  But it's just a... 
[03:59:00]  It's not something that you bring up in any context, I wouldn't think.  It was a little goofy, but it's okay.  It wasn't meant to be goofy.  Get off the guy's back.  Do you think it was bad manners?  It was just odd.  It wasn't bad manners because it was bad manners.  I think that he...  No, it wasn't bad.  Did you say, you know what?  I haven't fucking thought about that.  You're right.  Sam.  Sam.  He could be born dead.  Cut the replay.  Cut the replay.  We have to go back in time.  The baby's dead.  Oh, no. 
[03:59:30]  No.  E-Rock.  Hello, E-Rock?  Yes.  Yeah.  For the record, I got a couple phone calls that I didn't take.  Jim said she was.  Your wife is not pregnant, correct?  No, she is not.  If your wife was pregnant, and a man came up to her at her place of work and said, gee,  I hope it's not stillborn because my friend's was, would you think that that's like a normal  or positive thing to bring up with her?  I'd show up at work.  And what would you do?  What?  Oh, I'd be fucking livid. 
[04:00:00]  You see, Dennis?  I think I'm just used to all of you saying and doing such appropriate things, including  the people here at work, including at home, Matt.  But Dennis is supposed to be the moral compass.  If E-Rock came in and said, hey, my wife is pregnant, I would say, congratulations.  Do they know who the father is?  Oh, Eric.  You see, he thinks somebody else is dipping in that nagle pussy.  Like at my last doctor appointment, Matt tried to tell the doctor that he's convinced  that the baby was conceived face down, ass up.  And I was like, you don't tell.  Because it was.  No, but it wasn't.  But that's where I came inside of you. 
[04:00:30]  When your face was down and your ass was up.  I mean, if you're talking about physics, most likely, yes.  And I shook her by the ankles.  Okay.  What position were you in?  I don't think it was that day, but he thinks it was that day.  But you don't tell the doctor.  There's not a choice.  Right.  It's not like, ooh, we were doing it standing.  No, it was from behind.  Okay.  With her big, giant feet wrapped around my mouth.  So you were standing.  We call it the talon.  The talon.  Mm-hmm.  All I'm saying is I'm used to this inappropriate.  You're good at endearing yourself. 
[04:01:00]  See, I like that Matt endears himself to the audience at the cost of his wife, Nicole.  Biggins from the morning mashup.  Well, we're trending.  It says Dennis Falcone is crushing it on the after show.  He is.  At least somebody likes it.  He is.  Yeah.  Well, that's what you remember.  You've got to watch out for it.  Because somebody comes and somebody can crush that fetus, Nicole.  It's crazy.  While we're talking about crushing.  While we're talking about crushing.  Am I right?  Go do belly flops.  Look, I'll buy her some Pampers or put on the baby's born.  Okay.  Dennis, I feel like you have to do better than Pampers if you're going to get Nicole a gift. 
[04:01:30]  All right.  I'll talk to Opie about things like that.  Take her out for a nice steak.  Look.  All right.  The steak's not going to do it either.

[04:03:00]  Or online at IHateStevenSinger.com.  Matt Matty Ryan, 23, was just paying very close attention to that.  Well, I hope that's not that voice you use.  Now, are you listening to that?  That was the Jew coming out.  Awful.  Boy, Matt, when our baby's dead, I want a pair of studs.  Now you know why, when Nicole comes in here, we've got to get straight to vagina talk.  Because none of that, like, were you paying attention?  I want to go apple picking again.  What were you going to say, Eric? 
[04:03:30]  I was going to say, you said Denny, you know, could make it up to Nicole.  I think Denny should make it up to Nicole.  You see, you agree with me that it's totally out of line, right, Eric?  Very inappropriate.  Roland.  Roland's nodding.  It's crazy, is it not?  Yeah, like boofy.  Roland is the king.  He said, like boofing.  I don't think this is the same thing as boofing.  But Roland is the king of being out of line.  Okay.  And he didn't make any comments about stillborn babies.  You guys are taking it totally wrong.  It wasn't meant like that.  Listen, you know, you're talking about shows. 
[04:04:00]  You're talking about Orange is the New Black.  You're talking about House of Cards.  You're talking about Arrested Development.  Are you ready for the next big thing from Netflix?  Yep.  You guys ready?  Yep.  Prepare yourself for Notorious, Netflix's newest comedy special starring international stand-up  sensation Russell Peters.  You know Russell Peters?  I've heard about him.  Russell started doing stand-up as a kid in his native Toronto, and now he's one of the  biggest comedians in the world.

[04:04:30]  diverse audiences on the planet, he's sold out arenas like Madison Square  Garden and Sydney's Royal Opera House.  Also launching with Russell's new special, Notorious, is Russell Peters vs. the World,  an exclusive four-part series that takes you behind the scenes on Russell's tour and  has tons of great outtakes and interviews with his family and friends.  Don't miss Notorious and Russell Peters vs. the World, now streaming only on Netflix.  Now, Dennis, before we go, is there something you'd like to say to Nicole? 
[04:05:00]  I told her it wasn't meant like that.  You are a true scumbag in every sense of the world, Dennis.  You are the biggest scumbag that I've ever worked with.  Congratulations.  It wasn't meant like that.  I did say I'm sorry.  You are worse than that redskins guy who called Troy Aikman a queer and wouldn't apologize.  No, no, no.  I wouldn't say that.  I said I'm sorry.  Well, I don't know for sure.  Did she interpret it that way?  But she's got a very tough skin.  Yes.  Hopefully that'll protect baby.  I told her she looks great every day.  She's glowing.  Look, nobody wants to hear you flirting with her in front of her husband. 
[04:05:30]  It gets creepier by the second.  Why don't you guys just fuck up here and have a dead kid in front of me?  The question is, would you like to apologize to Nicole?  I apologize to Nicole.  I hope you accept my apology.  It wasn't meant like that.  Would you like to apologize to her husband?  And to Mr. Nicole as well.  Mr. Matt Biggins.  And would you like to apologize to little baby Samantha?  He wants me to name the baby Samantha.  It's a beautiful name.  La Samantha.  La Samantha.  Yeah, with an apostrophe.  Would you like to apologize to Samantha Biggins?  Congratulations to Samantha Biggins.  Welcome to the world.  Yes.  Thank you. 
[04:06:00]  And hopefully she's not stillborn.  No, because you'll seem like a real asshole talking to a stillborn kid as if it's alive.  This won't be so funny in six months.  I know.  Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Biggins.  Thank you, Dennis Falcone.  I hope you've learned something.  And we'll see you tomorrow when this continues.  Ron and Fez are next.  Goodbye.
