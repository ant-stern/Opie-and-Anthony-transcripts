<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's ninth-anniversary broadcast on SiriusXM was a chaotic and often offensive affair.  The show began with Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, reminiscing about their early days on the network. They recounted their low initial listenership (under 10,000 weekly), their placement on a premium channel, and humorous conflicts, including a feud with a coworker nicknamed "Oompa Loompa" over studio space.  They also detailed awkward technical difficulties during their first broadcast and played audio clips highlighting these issues.  The anniversary segment included numerous anecdotes, such as a clash with building staff and John Valby's inappropriate singing in a piano store.  The conversation frequently digressed into personal details, such as Opie’s daughter's birthday and Norton’s sleep schedule, all while employing copious amounts of vulgar and offensive language. Norton, in a "charming" moment, even referenced "the brutal murder of Russian school children."  The segment ended with a discussion of Miriam Carey ramming her car into the White House security barrier.

The discussion then shifted to Carey’s actions, with the hosts engaging in highly offensive speculation about her mental state and motives.  They moved on to the government shutdown, focusing on unpaid "essential" employees.  An Alex Jones segment was played, where he labeled the White House incident a "false flag" operation, sparking further conspiracy theories from the hosts about mind control and Manchurian candidates. This transitioned into a discussion about the U.S. debt ceiling, laced with racist and xenophobic comments about Chinese people.  A humorous anecdote about the Bugs Bunny character Finster and edited Looney Tunes cartoons followed, before the conversation returned to politics with a focus on hot mic recordings of Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, leading to more offensive and bigoted remarks.  A major turning point occurred when Opie accidentally, or possibly intentionally, revealed co-worker Eric ("E-Rock")'s phone number, resulting in a deluge of calls and abusive messages. The hosts' attempts to use the dump button failed, adding to the chaos.  A former acquaintance of a female caller, "Irving," then called in, recounting a past sexual encounter with her when she was a minor.  The segment concluded with frantic attempts to contact E-Rock and discussions about Miley Cyrus and Opie's commitment to compensating E-Rock for the phone number incident.

The fallout from E-Rock's exposed number dominated the next segment. The hosts discussed the flood of offensive messages, many targeting E-Rock's weight, and speculated on his reaction.  Listeners' tweets and screenshots of messages were discussed, showing images depicting E-Rock as a chubby baby and fake contest entries.  Opie offered to pay for E-Rock’s Disney World vacation (excluding meals) as an apology.  The hosts debated whether E-Rock was genuinely upset or seeking attention. The segment concluded with the transition to "Chucktober," a planned segment about radio failures, and a call from comedian Dan Soder.

A "Jocktober" segment featured Scott and Todd, whose antagonistic dynamic was a recurring theme.  It started with a nonsensical parody song about taco meat, followed by a discussion of Carrie Underwood's Beatles cover and the resulting negative tweets.  Brian from "Impractical Jokers" called in, mistaking the taco meat song for a new bit and expressed his fandom, receiving an invitation to appear on the show.  The segment included more Scott and Todd banter, Scott's rambling statements about movies (especially "The Boat Movie"), and a heavily edited phone scam segment featuring Sam, an employee at a clothing store, who was revealed to be part of the prank.  The "How Long Before You Tap Out" game was also mentioned, along with further comments on the taco meat song and phone scam segments.  The segment continued to utilize racist, homophobic and other offensive language.

A final segment saw Opie and Anthony mocking a poorly executed phone scam.  Chef Sue Torres from Suenos was then brought in to promote her restaurant.  The hosts, along with Dan Soder, engaged in a lengthy discussion about tacos, including a humorous tangent about fake tuna in restaurants.  Further discussion of the E-Rock phone number incident and speculation about his reaction and potential revenge followed.  The show included numerous plugs for Sue Torres' restaurant, Dan Soder's shows, a cancer benefit, a YouTube video, and a MyPillow commercial.  Dan Soder performed a stand-up bit about Russians and his mugging avoidance techniques.  The show ended with more speculation about E-Rock's response, comments on SiriusXM's Diversity Day (with emphasis on the refreshments), and Opie recounting a negative experience working at a Mexican restaurant. Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts and callers frequently used highly offensive and inappropriate language.

Unacceptable to my scene, but I'll give it a go.  50 cent Larry King, Opie and Anthony show.  Go, go.  I know you're feeling the flow. 
[00:05:00]  But Opie's mother huck and Jimmy's trying to get blown.  And we come to play around and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah.  On the edge of your chair.  Cause you really want to hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now Mike Tyson up in this bitch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Booga booga booga.  Booga booga.  Enough of this platter.  Let's get this show on the road.  Good morning, everyone. 
[00:06:00]  Oh my God.  And ain't it a fine morning?  It sure is, Mr. Krumia.  It sure is.  Nicey nice.  They said it would never last.  Wow.  Nine years at Sirius XM.  Nine fucking years.  I heard they're firing you at the end of this year. 
[00:06:30]  How many times?  Well, they'll eventually be right.  Well, eventually, but.  And then they'll go, told you, I told you so.  Nine fucking years?  Nine fucking years.  Yeah.  It's kind of depressing, to be honest with you.  How the hell did that happen?  The first four, no one was even listening.  I think people only started listening about three, four years ago.  Yeah.  I know.  Nine years ago, we came back to radio after a, I don't know, over two years.  26 months.  Huh?  26 months.  26 months. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Wow.  I always want to say two and a half years, and I know it was a little short of two and  a half years.  Yeah.  God, off the radio for almost two and a half years, we come back to XM, to nobody listening.  A lot of fanfare, the hardcores, which I thank to this day, because a lot of them are still  listening.  They were the only ones.  It was a small, small group of hardcores that were listening to us.  I think we were talking to less than 10,000 people a week.  Do you know, I remember when you said to me in Boston, I remember a number you gave,  but before we came back on, you had come up for a gig, and we could track them in those 
[00:07:30]  days because it was a $2 fee.  Yes, there was a fee people had to pay just to hear us.  And I remember this before we were back on, and you're like, yeah, we're up to 11,000  people.  I mean, we're starting.  11,000?  I remember that before we came back on.  11,000.  Okay.  Oof.  That's fucking good.  But then out of those 11,000, they actually have to listen.  You know what I mean?  Right.  They were signed up, but were they listening?  So I think it's pretty accurate to say that maybe 10,000 people were listening to this  fucking radio gold.  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  This gem of a program.  Well, we were on a premium channel.  They were trying to get that business going, but that meant you had to pay extra just to  have them turn on the channel.  And I remember arguing with Hugh Pinero at the time going, come on, man.  You know.  Take us off that stupid fucking.  What?  To make some pocket money, you're holding us back.  I remember telling them this, but the money was so important to them back then.  They really thought, you know, it was important to make that little, I mean, little extra money 
[00:08:30]  and hold us back from the masses.  Yeah.  And then I think it was Eric Logan who came in and said, what the fuck?  And he got us off that immediately.  Yeah.  That was.  Immediately.  That was depressing.  It was sad.  We were on that for a year or less.  I don't know.  Some of the listeners may remember.  I can only talk about this in broad strokes.  I should have written some of that stuff.  Misogynistic.  Some of that stuff down.  So nine years later, we finally, I mean, finally have a pretty decent audience.  Yeah.  Thanks to everybody for, you know, hanging in there as we slowly rebuilt this fucking thing. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Crazy.  Nine fucking years, though.  I'm trying to think of like, you know, when we first, all right, the studio, I remember  the studio being smaller before they redid it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Walking in.  Kind of weird vibe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, we had to take over that whole fucking years.  Fuck.  They had a whole bunch of shows in there.  And we basically came marching and said, all of this has to go. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  And they listened to us except for that one guy.  Broadway channel guy, was it?  I don't know.  See, they just become like distant memories.  Remember that guy?  Well, there was one holdout and it was in his contract or something.  So we refused to leave.  Everyone else left.  They're like, cool.  We'll move over to the other facility, which actually is nicer.  Yeah.  Who was it?  Jonathan Schwartz?  Yeah.  Right?  Okay.  I do remember.  Jonathan Schwartz with the fucking Oompa Loompa guy who was his like producer, I guess. 
[00:10:00]  Oompa Loompa.  And we had to build.  How he used to play the music.  Oompa Loompa.  Right.  All right.  Now it's all coming back to me.  And we had to build.  We had to build around them.  It's kind of like when you go to a city and you see that one old house is the, you know,  the holdout.  So they have to build huge skyscrapers around this like extremely old, tiny little building  or a tiny little restaurant or a tiny little house.  We had to do that with this John Schwartz guy.  He refused to leave. 
[00:10:30]  So he had a desk, but we built everything kind of around him.  God, I remember that.  I don't know what that was about.  I don't know why he refused to leave because he had nothing to do with us.  He didn't like us.  You don't mean the Oompa Loompa guy.  Oompa Loompa was his producer, but that was the guy.  He was the holdout right there.  Yeah.  We had no connection.  He was doing a whole different thing than us.  In that tiny little studio, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then they even moved him to almost a closet and that didn't deter him. 
[00:11:00]  He still stayed.  Yeah.  We're going to need to put you in storage B.  Yeah.  Remember the conflict with the Oompa Loompa?  That helped us in a way, though.  It was like a really weird pushback.  Right.  And a guy we could mock and make fun of.  And the shots would come in with Oompa Loompa on them.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Used to play the fucking theme song.  We'd play the theme song and then treasure him.  It would kill him.  Fuck, that was funny.  That was all nine years ago.  God.  Yeah.  I remember the fucking, we walked into the office, which eventually became the production 
[00:11:30]  office and had the meeting on the, what are those phones, the speaker system phone?  Sure.  Sitting there and trying to have a mature meeting.  Oh, God.  It was so weird.  The office was good.  We had like a good office, that big, long office.  Oh, no.  Because they moved everybody out.  Computers and everything.  Yeah.  They were moving everyone out slowly but surely.  And then eventually they ripped the whole thing apart and made a gorgeous, gorgeous facility  for us.  We used to actually hang out in the office and stuff. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  Yeah.  I showed off my new Pebble phone.  Oh, boy.  People loved it.  The rest is history.  The Mastapo.  Yeah.  All the fun of nine years ago.  Right.  Holy shit.  Nine years.  Fucking nine years.  Nine fucking years ago.  So, so weird.  So, we've been at, we've been at XM longer than we were together on radio before XM.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's what I'm saying.  That's fucking weird.  Wow. 
[00:12:30]  Well, we only did, I mean, between firings and suspensions.  Six years, maybe.  We did three in Boston, a little over three.  And then we did, I think we made four years.  Yeah, was it?  Four years.  Yeah, we made four years.  Four years before.  In New York at N.E.W.  Yeah.  So, seven years.  Yeah.  Ish.  About seven years, and now we've done nine on satellite.  Crazy.  And we did almost a year at BAB together.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, not, not full time, but pretty close to it at, near the end. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, wow.  That's cray.  That's a long time.  Yeah.  Well, things are finally moving forward.  We have a very proactive boss now.  Yeah, me too.  He is a mover and a shaker.  Where if something gets sent to him, like an email or something, that we have a problem with it, he picks up the ball and runs with it. 
[00:13:30]  Just an example.  Well, what if the email is hugely sarcastic in nature?  He doesn't seem to care.  He'll solve that problem, too.  Well, I mean, you know, we almost didn't have Taco Day today.  Hey.  And the listeners demand Taco Day, right, Jimmy?  Do you know how many emails I get, and they're like, when we know you guys are eating well, we're happy out here.  Yeah, sometimes it's not talking for four minutes, but we know you're feeling good.  They get very excited. 
[00:14:00]  Yes.  We could be happier.  Yes.  We could be happier.  Well, last night, what a distressing email I got.  Yeah.  It was an email from everybody, or to everybody, pretty much, staff, Tim Sabian, you know, and it was, it was, no tacos tomorrow.  So I wanted, you know, I wasn't going to sit for that, so I emailed back, without an ounce of sarcasm, WTF, bunch of exclamation points. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  And, uh, and, uh, question marks, no tacos, uh, lame, dude.  With a lot of yous?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Send.  Nice.  That's how you could tell you weren't being sarcastic.  Of course.  Well, um.  It was sent to your Gmail, Jim.  Well, let me tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  Tim Sabian saw how realistically disappointed and upset I was. 
[00:15:00]  Yep.  At no tacos.  That he, uh, sent his own email.  Uh, what does that say there, uh, Sam Roberts?  It says, uh, get Jose to make tacos.  Ellipses.  Call him now, caps, exclamation, exclamation, exclamation.  Or a restaurant, mole, exclamation, exclamation.  Uh-huh.  What about being proactive, exclamation, exclamation, which, there should be a question mark in there  somewhere.  Of course.  That is a question.  Uh, then he's got the address to this restaurant. 
[00:15:30]  And then he writes, make it happen, ellipses, no excuses, four exclamations, Tim.  There's, that's who's in charge now, motherfuckers.  That's right.  That's who's fucking, yes.  Large and in charge now.  Wow.  That's right.  Grubhub.  You can now have his number.  You know what, though?  Next email, Tim sends with a phone number and a guy to call.  You know?  You know, this will translate to real shit eventually.  I mean, so far, Tim's been here, what, a month? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He made a hole, and he's getting us tacos today.  I think he's doing a terrific job.  I'm glad I didn't sarcastically put something like, you know, hey, fuck him up the ass.  Right.  You know, because Tim would be like, all right, we'll send someone to anally rape him.  Right.  Spinning your palm, dot, dot, dot.  Make it happen.  No excuses.  Well, three hours later, we got an email from Roland that said, all is good, Anthony and  Tim.  Taco Friday is back on.  Yeah.  And what was his solution? 
[00:16:30]  We don't know yet, right?  Well, tacos will be served around 9.30 a.m.  Okay.  Chef Sue Torres will be making the tacos.  All right.  And he writes about her amazing food, and he writes, I apologizes for the mini glitch.  I apologize for the mini glitch.  God, everyone is taking this talk very seriously.  Very, very seriously.  They understand the listeners demand this, so.  Roland, you know Roland takes it really seriously when bosses start telling him.  Of course. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, my God.  He gets like crazy thinking he's going to be fired.  Right.  He goes into an immediate panic.  He's taking this very personally.  The guy does an amazing job for us, but in his head, I don't think he sees it that way.  Yeah.  And I try to tell him over and over again to relax and enjoy yourself a little bit.  Whatever.  But Sabian, this is very good news.  He's almost out of the talking stage.  Yeah.  He's been talking for a month.  And boy, can he talk.  Oh, can he ever. 
[00:17:30]  The other day we were in a meeting.  I just said to him, stop talking.  You did?  Yes.  Because he will give you a laundry list of things.  I think a lot of people can relate to this.  A laundry list of things that you already know.  Right.  Because you're in the situation.  Yeah, yeah.  All the stuff he wants to do and should be done and all that.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We all know that.  Stop talking.  Because I want to make this point a brand new point.  Which I did.  But I think we should start the Tim Sabian list.  He's made a hole. 
[00:18:00]  Okay.  And he's got tacos coming in today.  So you want a list of things Tim Sabian has done.  Yeah.  What else has he done?  What do you mean he's made a hole?  He made a hole over here.  Oh, on the console, you mean.  He moved my mic stand, which meant he had to make a new hole so that I could push this  board five inches forward, giving me a few more inches of room here.  We talked about when we had our old regime of management, how for some reason the idea  of drilling a hole into the console was a no-go. 
[00:18:30]  It was very on the we don't want to do this list.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Well, he got that done immediately.  I mean, the other stuff, you know, the giant screen is still there and that keyboard  over there is still there.  The pile of dead keyboards in the corner.  The pile of dead keyboards is still there.  Yeah, it's still there.  But, you know.  You know, I think we're heading out of the talking stage, so I think we're going to start  seeing some real changes soon.  I still have to.  Soon enough.  Every time someone walks behind me, I got a rock like a fucking retard in his feces. 
[00:19:00]  See, that's what they do.  Yeah.  I know.  I saw the special on fucking Willowbrook.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  That had a hurt.  I was just starting.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I stubbed my toe.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I was rushing to that one so much, I hit my shin and toe.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  On the anniversary, too.  Yeah.  I mean, we could play audio from our first show nine years ago, but I hear you guys did  that last year. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  I was not here last year for the big anniversary because I was having my second child.  Oh.  So today's another big day for me.  My daughter's one years old.  Or is it one year old?  One year.  One year old.  Yeah, I guess that's how you say it.  Oh, no, here's how you say it.  If you're not sure to go, in one year, my daughter will be two.  There you go.  This way you don't have to pluralize anything.  So it's her birthday today.  Her birthday.  Happy birthday, Opetta.  Oh, yes.  Opetta.  Happy birthday, Opetta.  Yeah, that was a year ago. 
[00:20:00]  Opetta.  Opetta.  Opetta's one.  What a horrendous name that would have been.  Opetta.  Opetta.  What do you mean?  That's her name.  Opetta.  I think it's a precious stone.  Yeah.  Ah, yes.  Yeah.  So we're very excited about that.  You know, very happy today.  Mm-hmm.  I liked hearing the audio of this.  I don't remember it, but I mean, I liked, it seemed like so long ago.  It was so nerve-wracking.  The camera was in there, right?  I think first day on the air day.  Yeah.  It's just, well.  What?  I always revert back to happy-to-be-there guy. 
[00:20:30]  I remember being very rusty.  Yeah, yeah.  Because after a while, you know, whether you like this or not, that's up to your own personal  fucking choosing, I guess.  But you better.  But when you're in this, you know, you don't feel rusty.  No.  Everything, you know, you're-  It's very natural.  Even when you come in here sick, you know you could do it. 
[00:21:00]  But when you take almost two and a half years off, man, the rust.  I just remember, like, our timing was off.  Yeah.  Everything sounded weird.  You don't really think about, like, on a daily basis, you don't think.  Like, sit down and grab the mic and go, okay, I'm going to be broadcasting to the masses  today.  Right.  It's like you just come in and do it.  Yeah.  But after a lot of time off, and when you come back on, that's like the thing that's in your  head.  It's like, oh, fuck, here we go.  Right.  Did you do any test shows?  God, no.  Test shows. 
[00:21:30]  I don't think-  Did we-  We did do test shows at NEW when we first got brought there.  Didn't we go on at, like, two in the morning or some shit?  Um, yeah, I think so.  Yeah, yeah.  But after being off the air-  Yeah, we did.  In the middle of the night, we had to, like, just kind of feel our way around.  After being off the air for 26 months, you guys didn't think to jump on and just-  No.  Do a couple shows before you broadcast?  What, are you the boss?  Oh, you're right.  Me and Ann were so depressed, I don't think we talked for a year.  Is that what you call your show every day?  Test show.  Are you just doing test shows? 
[00:22:00]  That's it.  It's certainly not a recap.  All right.  We didn't talk for a year.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we started kind of talking again.  It was weird.  Maybe.  I mean, here and there we talked, but in general, we didn't really talk for a year.  It was so deeply depressing.  And then when we finally started seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, as they say,  then we started, you know, getting shit together.  Didn't it feel like it would never change?  Didn't it feel like the show would never come back on the air?  I remember that feeling of, oh, yeah.  It's never going to happen. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's why I didn't take advantage of my time off.  I should have done more.  But the whole time, like, I just fucked up everything.  My entire life sucks.  That was depressing.  And then, you know, then satellite had it kind of develop.  You know, thank God.  We were in a train station.  As much as we beat the shit out of this place, we were fucked.  We were dead in the water without this place.  And we were mocking at that time the serious.  We were looking.  I think you had a serious one in your truck.  Right.  I don't remember why you had it, but it was, like, drilled into the top.  It was all fucking big.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  I never thought.  Because I was doing so much traveling, and then, you know, this thing did pop up.  I'm like, oh, that's.  Especially at first, satellite radio was fucking cool as shit.  I personally think they've made some mistakes along the way, unfortunately.  But, you know.  It was so weird to curse, too.  Remember?  But I just loved listening to music without commercials and those stupid jocks.  And they were playing, like, a lot more variety and all that stuff.  Yeah.  And then, you know, I was driving all over the country, so it made sense to get, you know, 
[00:23:30]  get the satellite.  Never thinking that we'd actually work for the company.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I do have the disc of our, a few clips from our first show.  Do you want the first words, at least?  First words.  Oh, boy.  First words after almost two and a half years off of radio.  Our first show on XM nine years ago.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  You guys did this last year.  I don't remember.  I already hear it. 
[00:24:00]  The fake fucking laugh.  You don't like it?  Oh, Christ.  Yeah, yeah.  I completely acknowledge it.  We got to get that energy going.  Maybe I still do it today, but not as much.  But there was a time, I fake laughed way too much, and I could hear it already in this clip.  Yeah, yeah.  I have no idea what's going on.  Is the Rage Against the Machine music still playing?  What a great way to start our brand new careers at XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:24:30]  Tripping over ourselves.  Now I don't hear the music, but I think we're live on the air, right?  All right.  Well, what'd you pick up on?  Just nothing has changed.  No, right?  That could be us opening the show today.  Is this working?  I don't know.  I can't hear you.  That's exactly it.  Also, just a little tidbit.  I was sick as shit.  I got the flu like October 1st. 
[00:25:00]  I'm like, seriously?  I had two and a half years to get the flu.  I remember calling you going, dude, I don't think I could even come in.  And they had it set up in such a way with, like, promotion and the press and everything  that I had no choice.  I had to be there.  Yeah.  But I remember really being sick.  We're live on the air, right?  All right.  Well, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, indeed.  Welcome.  What a cluster F.  What happened?  Now it's good?  But we can't hear the music. 
[00:25:30]  Satellite.  We can't hear the music.  We like talking over the Rage Against the Machine music.  Oh, my God.  It just ended, so, okay, here we go.  There's like 50 people looking at us, and we have no effing idea what's going on.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio, Anthony.  Yes, yes.  Back after a short break.  We're finally back.  My God.  About two years worth of break.  Ugh.  And these guys just put the studio together literally five minutes ago. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, I got rid of that.  You did the but back then.  But.  But.  But.  Everything was but.  Do you remember but, Sam?  Yeah.  Oh, I worked on that word.  It's like a distant memory.  For a really long time.  I do not say but anymore.  Uh-uh.  But.  Ago?  They're still putting it together.  Yeah, that's true.  We're sitting in the midst of a bunch of construction and electronics that are surrounding us right now.  Right.  I'm in front of a jumbotron.  Yeah, you look.  Pretty much what I can describe this as. 
[00:26:30]  You look completely ridiculous.  I know.  Do you know what all those buttons do?  All I know is my responsibility last time we were on the air two years ago was to show up and drink beer.  Right.  That was pretty much it.  Yeah.  That's all I had to do.  Now I have buttons and stuff.  I think you could launch missiles from what they put in front of you.  And I just.  Buttons.  There's buttons and things that.  And I'm supposed to do things?  Yeah.  I don't know.  All of a sudden they were talking about like we were talking about something we wanted to do later on in the show. 
[00:27:00]  Uh-huh.  And they're like, oh, Anthony can trigger that.  I'm like, no, I shan't be triggering anything.  I'm not triggering things.  I don't know.  That means we have something planned for later on?  Apparently.  Oh, all right.  I hope I don't have to trigger it.  And you've got to love our old listeners.  They're like, enough with the music.  Start the show.  Yeah.  And now that they're paying for the Opie and Anthony show, they're going to get quite abusive, I think.  I know.  Yeah.  Well, we figured that one out right off the bat.  It took four minutes.  Right.  We understood that clearly. 
[00:27:30]  That's not that bad, I guess.  I don't know.  I was just talking about it.  Yeah.  Jeez.  What?  That was a while ago.  I remember that.  I would have never thought we would have made nine years.  Mm-hmm.  And then, of course, Jim Norton's first words.  Oh.  We've got to say hi to Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you?  I'd be better if I had room.  I got two of the guys that took over the Russian middle school filming me from three feet away. 
[00:28:00]  I guess that was in reference to the brutal murder of Russian school children.  And what was that?  Chest down.  Right off the bat.  Right on, Jimmy.  Yeah.  First words out.  Charming.  You expect nothing less.  What about all the fucking cameras?  What was that for?  What?  The people that were in there taping?  Filming and stuff, yeah.  Yeah, I think, you know.  Where is that footage?  That would be great. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I never saw any of it.  Who was that?  Can we find...  We should backtrack.  I think some of those clips just made the news like we're back, here they are, but I don't  think it was...  I would love to see that.  I don't know who has that.  I know.  It took over the Russian middle school filming me from three feet away.  I mean, there's two Chechenians just standing here with a camera in my face.  Would you like to take a seat, Jimmy?  No, I'm fine.  I'd rather stand up.  I'm tired.  You're going to stand up?  Yeah, I've been up since yesterday, man.  If I sit down, I'm going to fall asleep.  Yeah, that's one person that's really going to have a hard time adjusting is Lil Jimmy, 
[00:29:00]  because he's a stand-up comic, of course, everyone knows.  And he's got that nightlife thing, you know?  He's got to do his club gigs, and they're very late.  So he's pretty much the guy that's going to be up and then stay up through the show  and sleep when he gets home.  This is the best part of this whole thing.  When Ant and I were deciding, should we do afternoons or mornings, afternoons or mornings?  I got about a thousand phone calls from Norton.  You've got to do afternoons.  You've got to do afternoons.  Panic to Chechen.  I'll never sleep.  When am I going to do my spots?  When am I going to F my whores? 
[00:29:30]  Dude, that really is what it's about.  The night before the big return of the show, I got stood up by some woman, and I paid for  a prostitute.  You did?  So nothing has changed in two years.  Or nine years.  Because now we're in the future.  Yes.  Nothing changes in the end.  It really is amazing, isn't it?  Here's when I found out that we were doing mornings.  I remember you got off the train from D.C.  I was out doing spots.  Right.  And I met you at Penn Station.  You had just come back.  And I was like, well, how was the meeting with XM? 
[00:30:00]  And you're like, well, we're going to sign whatever.  We're going to do mornings.  And I'm like, oh, we should probably do afternoons.  And you're like, no, no, we've got to do mornings.  We have to do mornings.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just because our goal was to take over the whole channel, I guess.  Yeah.  It was smart.  Now let's talk about us moving back to afternoons with Tim Sabian.  I don't like that, though.  There's some talk.  I don't like it at all.  To be honest with the people out there.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  I...  There's some talking going on.  I wouldn't.  No.  It's a step down.  What would they listen to in the morning?  If we're not on the...  Exactly.  They'd find something else. 
[00:30:30]  But I mean, what would they do?  Listen to replays from the day before in the morning?  Yeah.  It doesn't make any sense.  Right.  Silly.  And then I think we should play one more clip from our first XM show nine years ago today.  Is it a George Carlin bit?  No.  Remember the Carlin bits?  No.  Yeah.  They kept playing over and over the same one?  Well, they didn't have a lot of stuff.  They didn't have a lot of commercials or promos yet.  Shooter two.  Your sales department was new. 
[00:31:00]  And you only had one sound clip.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  Dillon, right?  Dillon.  Yeah.  Dillon.  Dillon.  We had nothing set up.  Nothing.  We had two and a half years to at least set some stuff up, and we set up nothing.  Although that was a last-minute signing, too.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Actually, well, Sirius wanted us really bad.  Really bad.  And we did a lot of meetings with them, and we actually agreed to, you know, something. 
[00:31:30]  And they were working out the details, and we basically said no to XM.  And then Sirius all of a sudden stopped calling us.  Oh, God.  With, I think, only a month left before, you know, we were allowed to work again.  They just stopped calling us, because they knew they were getting Howard, but no one else  knew that yet.  We learned that later on, that they didn't need us anymore, because they were getting Howard.  They didn't need both shows at the time. 
[00:32:00]  So, I go, Bob, you got to call XM, and fuck, now we got to, like, now we got to drop our price.  Remember?  Yeah, we had the little battle starting up, the brief bidding war that went on.  And then it's like, uh-oh, one side stopped calling, quick, quick, sign with the only game  in town, quick.  Because Bob goes, we're effed, we're fucked.  I go, no, we're not.  You call up XM, and at this point, we just got to, we have no negotiating power here,  and you get us signed over there. 
[00:32:30]  So, we actually, they got us cheap.  You make that deal.  An XM.  The Turk.  XM was like, all right.  And for the price, they're like, yeah, of course, we'll do it now.  You know?  And then, uh, whatever.  The rest is history.  But we were, we were really close to really fucked.  Anyway, one more clip from nine years ago.  We have to play E-Rock's first beating.  Day one.  Oh, no, day one?  Day one.  Oh, wow.  E-Rock, who wasn't E-Rock yet.  He was just Eric, a.k.a. Sex Bagel. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, he was, he was trying Sex Bagel.  Day one, he was trying Sex Bagel.  Sex Bagel.  He came in with that name.  He came in with Eric Nagel, the Sex Bagel.  Was this, um, I don't think I even knew Eric at that point.  Had I even met him?  Yeah.  Yeah?  At what, a meeting or something?  Probably, yeah.  Yeah, we did some walking around.  Eric, he was the new kid, though.  He was the new kid in town, all fresh-faced. 
[00:33:30]  He was my, uh, little puppy dog back then.  Oh, boy.  He just followed me around.  Well, you were his hero.  Yeah.  Number two.  Fuck that up, bud.  What are you gonna do?  Number two hero.  What are you gonna do?  Slid down the list with fucking amazing acceleration over the years.  I'm kind of proud of that, if you want to know the truth.  I would be, too.  Okay, good.  You don't want to be the hero of an Eric Nagel.  And that's bad why?  Yeah.  Um, but here's, uh, Eric, a.k.a. Sex Bagel, getting beaten up day one. 
[00:34:00]  Back on the radio, nine years ago, with XF.  And then we brought a new guy aboard, uh, uh, Sex Bagel.  He's in the other room.  Where is Vanilla Ice Hair?  Can you come in for a couple seconds?  Yeah, he was so excited that we hired him for the show that he went out and dyed his hair.  Now, I.  Yes, Eric would frost his hair.  He would use sunnin' and frost his hair.  Day one, we're just on his shit. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Went out and dyed his hair.  Now, I was a little confused.  Um, I still am a little bit.  Oh, what?  About Eric.  Because, uh, he's, he's, like, 15 years old, but he's been in radio with, like, Marconi.  He's worked with all.  Oh, my God.  No one's, no one's thinking he's young anymore.  I know.  Remember?  There was a time we all thought he was really young for his age.  That went away.  Yeah.  That went away.  Holy fuck, I forgot about that. 
[00:35:00]  He was the fresh-faced little guy.  Yep.  And also the idea of being super radio-experienced went away, because he's just been sitting  here for the last nine years.  Isn't it amazing how people have just aged in this fucking place?  Yeah.  That's a tough nine years for everybody.  He had a very good start, and now he's just been kind of hanging out.  He came in as the wonder-kind of radio, and look at what he is now.  The guy that we make fat jokes and incompetent jokes about. 
[00:35:30]  He had a lot of experience.  Yeah.  So we couldn't believe how old he was.  We're like, you have to be older than this.  How old was he?  At the time, probably.  How old is he now?  He was probably 25, 24, 25.  24, 25.  Yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  I feel I've remained young and hard.  Vibrant.  Thank you, Sam.  It's a good word.  You actually-  Put that in the vernacular.  You actually look pretty damn good there, Jim Norton. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, thank you, Upster.  You haven't really aged.  In my heart, I feel so.  He's been in radio with, like, Marconi.  He's worked with all of them.  He's worked with 80 people in radio.  Everyone that's in radio, he's worked with at some point.  Yet, he's only 15.  And he never shuts up.  Oh.  Yes.  I do second that.  Oh, wow.  Great.  All right, fine.  We'll say a word.  He likes to talk.  Oh.  But that's okay.  And, yeah, Eric Sex Bagel is aboard the Opie and Anthony show as well. 
[00:36:30]  He's a snot.  He will be doing what?  Taking your phone calls?  And whatnot?  And various other things that no one else wants to do.  He has Stinky's old job.  Yes, he does.  That's what it was.  Taking the calls.  Very appreciative to have it.  Oh.  But he still talks the same.  Like, he's just so uncomfortable in the air.  He's so uncomfortable.  He doesn't know what this magic device is in front of him.  Fucking blithering idiot nine years later.  When he pops on mic with you on the after show. 
[00:37:00]  Different person.  No, no.  It's really not.  He's very uncomfortable to listen to.  He is very.  He's very difficult to do stuff with.  He's.  Look, it's tripping me up.  Yeah.  Just talking about him.  He's very uncomfortable.  His voice gets really weird and shaky.  Plus, he comes from the improv school of always saying no to everything.  Yes, right.  Which ends the improv.  Immediately.  Yeah.  So, there you go. 
[00:37:30]  Nine years.  You got all the clips as the day goes on, I guess.  Day go.  Ouch.  That's fucking offensive.  And it's taco day.  Yes.  Thanks to Tim Sabian.  Thanks, Tim.  Fucking Roland was ready to just blow it off.  Who should have worked with us nine years ago.  So, he's all like, you know, he's all rah, rah, rah.  And I go, look at us.  Really?  Just make it easier.  That's all I ask at this point.  Enough with the rah, rah.  I know we're still doing really good shows. 
[00:38:00]  Just make it easier to do.  That's it.  That's your whole job.  Stop with the rah, rah.  We're done with the rah, rah.  Just want somebody to make you feel good.  Right.  Just.  I go, this place is beating us down.  We still do good radio, but it's beating us down.  So, enough.  Yeah.  Just fix our studio.  And just make the job easier to do.  That's it.  Were you guys excited about the technology of satellite radio when you first signed up?  Like, were you like, oh my gosh, this is a new thing. 
[00:38:30]  We worked first, but then me and Ant, we were still kind of driving around together a little bit back then.  Were we commuting?  I'm trying to remember.  Oh, no, because I think I finally got my New York City apartment.  You used to rollerblade to work in New York.  Oh, right.  Yes, I did.  Until my stupid back gave out.  That's an old joke now, because I haven't been on the blades in a couple of years.  It's been a rough nine years.  But I remember we were still driving around together for whatever reason, and I remember one day we were excited about the new technology until I told Anthony, hey, you know what? 
[00:39:00]  I think we were stuck in Lincoln Tunnel traffic or somewhere where there were a lot of traffic, but cars coming our way pretty quickly.  And I go, hey, man, you know, it's very obvious which cars have the satellite radio, because that big, thick antenna on the top, it was a short, thick.  Like a shark fin.  Exactly.  Looked like a shark fin.  Hey, man, why don't we just start counting antennas?  One. 
[00:39:30]  It might have been one for every, I can't even say for every hundred cars.  I can't say that.  They were very rare.  It was, it was, we stopped counting.  We stopped counting.  We're like, okay, all right.  Under one percent.  But then I'm thinking, I'm like, but all those other cars would be listening to us if we were on regular radio.  Easily.  Or at least a lot of them.  Oh, yeah.  A nice chunk.  So it made us kind of sad.  Wasn't Mars the engineer on the first day?  I think so, yeah.  Mars has been around for nine years. 
[00:40:00]  That's correct.  I survived.  A fucking soldier, this kid.  Wait, but were you, Jaime was our engineer.  Jaime.  No, I was the engineer.  Jaime was the guy that put the planes together.  Oh.  The bigger picture.  It's been a rough nine for Mars, too, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little, a little, a little paunchy.  Actually, I think I look good.  A little paunchy these days.  Oh, my God.  Here you go.  I don't think you can get that leg up as high as you used to.  Oh.  He could kick our ass so easily. 
[00:40:30]  Fucking him and Mars would like, Mars and Master Poe would spar outside.  Would beat the shit out of each other.  There was fucking a UFC event going on outside with like two guys that were in shape.  And now look at him.  I was a little paunchy.  I was a little paunchy.  I was a little paunchy back then.  Remember?  Huh?  I was a little paunchy.  I was a little paunchy.  I was ball-headed.  You were bald back then?  Yeah, I was suffering from alopecia.  Oh, my God.  Remember?  He had like the mange.  Oh, that's right.  That was what it was?  Yeah.  Oh, I never knew what was going on there.  Yo, alopecia. 
[00:41:00]  Wait, you could cure alopecia?  Well, I went for shots, man.  They were actually injecting me in the scalp.  Shit, pinches once again.  Wait, alopecia is where your hair falls out, right?  Yes.  In splotches.  Yeah, it's blotches.  And in the face, too.  Yeah, I remember that.  Holy fuck, I do remember that.  Remember he had the mange?  And then when you had a five o'clock shadow, you were missing chunks of your beard.  Exactly.  I forgot about this until this very moment.  I thought you had cancer.  I remember.  I didn't know what was wrong.  I thought this guy has head cancer or some shit.  Wishful thinking.  Wait, so how do you get it all back together? 
[00:41:30]  The shots.  I recovered from the shots.  Because we're looking at a guy you would never think ever had this.  Yeah, the shots.  And they said it was stress.  And I didn't know what was stressing me out.  Master Poe.  Master Poe beating the shit out of you every day.  How about you fuckers?  Ouch.  Could be.  Every day.  Really?  Oh, shit.  The beginning when you guys first came out.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Well, because nothing was right.  We really had to fine tune the studio.  I remember losing my shit very early on.  Like, what the fuck is this?  You used to throw your hands up and go, I'm going home.  Yeah.  If that ain't fixed, I'm going home.  Because we couldn't get anything done. 
[00:42:00]  And you were the only guy in the building.  I was like, oh, shit.  Get it fixed.  Yeah.  Because we had our own spot.  So Mars was the only engineer that, there was no department.  It was just Mars.  Yeah.  But you guys would, yeah, would spar.  Because they took out all the cubicles.  So you guys would just beat the shit out of each other.  It was fun on 57th Street, man.  I loved it, man.  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to get that vibe back here, but it's impossible.  They just will not give us a bigger space.  And, you know, and they're like, well, you can have the fishbowl every Friday.  But it's not the same like how we did it. 
[00:42:30]  You know, people could just come in.  I know.  They wanted us to have, you know, they'd have to sign up in advance and all this.  Yeah.  We loved that open door where people could just come in.  Absolutely.  Go through the metal detectors and sit there and fucking whatever.  It was fun.  We can't get people around the office.  They want us to put blinders up if we're in fishbowl.  Yeah.  No, it was the whole vibe.  I know what Jimmy misses about that.  The fucking door.  The doorman guy.  Oh, yeah.  Remember the constant battle with the doorman guy? 
[00:43:00]  Jimmy fucking hated him, too.  He hated him.  What was his problem again?  He always had a problem.  He was one of those cocksuckers that if you forgot your ID, you'd talk to him every day.  And he just refused to let you up without it.  And then I said, fine, but I'll never acknowledge that fucking hunk of human garbage again.  And I didn't.  Right.  But Ant was the one holding out.  And then eventually you came around and you're like, yeah, he's a twat.  No, I would do it on purpose.  Like we would all walk in together and I'd be like, hey, how you doing?  And he would be all nice to me.  But finally you had it with him, too. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, I had it with him.  Yeah, he had rubbed it in.  Oh, yeah.  It could be a cocksucker, too.  Oh, I was being a fucking cocksucker.  Wait, how long did you have alopecia for?  Maybe a year or less.  Okay.  And the needles in the head fixed it?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at him.  But what does that re-stimulate?  Does that re-stimulate your hair cells?  What does it do?  Dude, I have no idea, man.  I just know that they hurt a little bit once in a while.  You still do?  Oh, no.  And I even did it on my face.  Probably a steroid they'd fucking drive in there. 
[00:44:00]  Steroid puts your system in super drive, man.  Yeah.  It's nice.  Takes that stress shit and chases it away from the area.  Fuck.  Fuck, yeah.  But he didn't do anything to the pubic hair, though.  I must admit.  What?  What do you got?  A big, huge...  I'm just saying.  Big, big, huge fucking man bush down there.  Why would you bring it up?  Never lost a pube down there.  Are they gray?  Uh, no.  A little?  Do you fucking, like, keep it trimmed up or what?  Hey, I'm an escape shit.  What's up?  What?  Look at you. 
[00:44:30]  You guys don't cut up?  Big Puerto Rican pubes.  Oh, God.  It's like a big taco salad.  Jesus.  I'm totally shaved.  That's even worse.  I don't even want to fucking hear this.  How about somewhere in between?  Well-kempt.  Well, you know, the guys in the building had big problems with you guys because we did  some things, man.  What did we do?  Didn't we have a problem with the people across the hall, like, on the other side of the elevators?  The Economist was there.  They hated us.  What did we do?  It was a conservative building.  You made one guy go downstairs and play the piano in the, um... 
[00:45:00]  John Velvet.  John Velvet.  The Steinway store.  Piano!  He was singing an inappropriate song.  He was?  Remember that?  And he was escorted out of there and, oh...  It's one of the greatest things we've ever done.  Yes, it was wonderful.  I don't...  Because Balby can play piano, like classical piano, and he started that way, and the people  were, like, impressed, and then he starts going into one of his fucking horrendous songs.  I like to find that.  It all sounds good until you hear, yaddle-ah!  Yaddle-ah!  You're like, oh, what is he doing now? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, shit.  It's the Steinway, uh, yeah.  They sold, like...  What are the pianos in there?  A hundred, two hundred thousand dollars?  Oh, fucking, yeah.  Top-of-the-line pianos.  Expensive Steinway pianos.  They would get, like, four customers a year, but all they needed was one or two, and they  paid all their bills.  And they had a showroom with, what, like five or six just spectacular fucking pianos just  sitting there.  And I remember the salespeople just bored day after day.  No one was in there.  So we, uh, we had John Valby go down.  And, uh, we have that clip? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, we'll play this.  Sure, you want it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Little boogie-woogie.  Very good.  This is going to be great when Eric gets kicked out, because he will.  Oh, of course.  This is where it's going to get really uncomfortable.  I was out on a date in my daddy's car. 
[00:46:30]  I picked her up in a Manhattan bar.  I finger-fucked her clit.  She didn't let out of me.  I had my cock in her throat too deep.  I was humping her face.  My pecker started to spit.  The doctor said the bitch had an epileptic fit.  Where, oh, where can my pecker be? 
[00:47:00]  The bitch's been in right off of me.  You're a man with two balls and a stump.  You said, I can't be my pecker when you take your next dog.  Gotcha.  Do we have more of that where we get kicked out?  Oh, my.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You've got to understand.  Just get to the point where we just stopped it.  The most premier piano shop in Manhattan. 
[00:47:30]  I hope people totally understand that.  This was the Steinway building.  The fucking flagship of Steinway pianos.  And the people that worked there were literally dressed in like tuxedos.  Extremely uptight.  Would show people around to these quarter million dollar pianos.  He sits down and fucking blurted that song out in the middle of their fucking store.  Under the ruse that he was just wanting to try out the piano. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And they thought it was good for business.  It would be on a radio show.  Yeah, of course.  You know how to play.  We appreciate someone that really knows their way around the-  The horror.  The horror.  Of those fucking guys.  That was filthy.  How was that filthy?  All right, so the-  Bit the dick off and shit it out.  Shit it out.  Here's the-  The bit continues here.  The text is saying, we need to leave now. 
[00:48:30]  One more.  One more.  Can you do one more quick?  Just one more?  One more?  One quick one?  Can you just do one quick one?  Like a 30 second one?  30 seconds.  Okay, yeah.  Don't allow him to do one more.  All right.  One more.  Nice.  Here we go.  Live from the Steinway facility.  I think they didn't want trouble.  From Jackson Handjobs and eating clitoris.  Watching your grandmother do it with little horus.  Brown pubic cunt hairs and toilet bowl rings. 
[00:49:00]  These are a few of my favorite things.  Popping bum blisters in the balls of my ass fat.  Taking a shit in my New York Yankees hat.  Fuck you.  Oh, that was great.  Oh, yeah.  I think he's done.  They're ganging up on us now.  Yeah.  They're clicking without the door.  Okay, we're leaving. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  That was fucking funny.  Awesome.  I miss John Veldes.  Of course.  Yeah.  He would come to town in this horrible van.  Yeah.  And sleep until his appearance.  Yeah.  He would drive all night just to do our radio show.  Remember that?  Yeah.  We'd just sleep on that couch and we'd actually have to wake him up and tell him it's time  to perform.  There's also a young Asian man who worked in the building with mustard on his lapel who  didn't like that you were there.  Yeah, but he doesn't know the mustard was from us. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, he thought it might be The Economist.  I hate Jim's logic.  I know the people that we share the floor with did not like our bathroom habits.  No, there was always some fucking nude broad or some fucking homeless guy using the bathroom.  Oh, that's right.  Jim was using the urinal with his pants completely.  Oh, right.  Oh, Jimmy used to come in and pull his pants down to his ankles to take a piss.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  People would walk in and just see his ass.  I forgot about that.  Mary Carey showed me her pussy in the stool.  I didn't get to touch it, but she showed it to me.  Gee.  It was hot.  Jim would pull his pants down and stand right behind you when you were at the urinal.  Yeah.  So you'd turn around and he'd just be standing there.  Right.  It was wonderful.  He'd also piss all over the floor in the urinal next to you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  If you were both in a stall, you would just see a stream of piss. 
[00:51:00]  Piss come under the stall.  That's an animal.  Oh, that's true.  And if you were in a stall and he knew it was you, he would walk into the stall next to you  just to piss at your feet.  Yeah.  That's great.  So, yeah, they were probably, the economists probably had a reason.  There was piss all over the floor.  Oh, that was great.  It smelled like the fucking Port Authority.  It really did.  Oh, my God.  Fucking funny.  The memories.  Those are the best things.  Oh, those were the golden years of satellite radio.  These are great days, bros.  And we did.  We'd have to go, one of us would have to go in with Tippy Tom.  Yeah.  Because he would say he had to take a shit. 
[00:51:30]  And then he would go into the stall and lock the door and pass out.  And pass out.  We couldn't get him awake.  We couldn't get him out of there.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Wow.  We'll have more memories as the show goes on.  Hmm.  We started nine years ago today, if you're just tuning in.  Oh, yeah.  The big comeback started nine years ago.  Wow.  And New Rock isn't even here for it.  I know.  He's, uh.  Shows you where his loyalty has gone.  Exactly.  He's piggy boying around. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  All right.  We should take our first break.  Yeah.  We got our grub.  We got to talk about that nut job down there in Washington.  Obama.  Oh, ha, ha.  See what I.  Another crazy.  Great.  Just another one.  Hey, watch the language.  Every day there seems to be a new fucking crazy.  Language.  That can't help themselves.  Insensitivity.  Another kook.  Another fucking whack job.  Look at the.  I mean, the footage they got is just amazing.  Yeah.  Why was she allowed to take off? 
[00:52:30]  They had her.  There was a kid in the car.  I don't know if they saw the kid.  Plus, they probably didn't expect that.  That's a man act.  Well, blow out the tires, at least.  She got four or five guys with their guns drawn and she's able to do a quick backup and  then, you know, maneuver out of that situation.  And then she was going.  Some said she was going 80 miles an hour, but now they're saying about 40 or 50.  It ended as it should have.  With any.  Pop, pop, pop, pop.  Any wacko that's ramming the fucking White House security fence, whatever it is with 
[00:53:00]  a car.  You just, you got to shoot them.  Fuck them.  Oh, yeah.  And they got everything wrong again.  They said she got out of the car because, what, she finally crashed a car or something.  And then they said she got out of the car and started shooting.  Turns out she didn't even have a gun.  No.  I still think they should have taken her out, but they got that little detail wrong.  She never had a gun.  But, I mean, she could have done a lot of damage with that car, obviously.  Deadly weapon.  Plus, you don't know.  You don't know if she doesn't have a gun.  You don't know if the car has explosives. 
[00:53:30]  So, I think they did exactly what they were supposed to do down there.  Right?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, look at people calling her.  And what do we know about her?  They're Miriam Carey.  And where's she from?  She's from Stanford, Connecticut, they're saying?  Is that her right there?  Oh, yeah.  She was a hygienist?  Dental hygienist?  This is how you know she's a selfish cunt.  She had her baby in the car.  Yeah.  A one-year-old baby.  A one-year-old.  While she's doing this.  No, she's just crazy, you know.  Selfish cunt.  She thought, logically, she was doing what she needed to do. 
[00:54:00]  I guess the dent that she worked for, it's coming out that when she came back from her  pregnancy, she was never the same.  She had a little of that postpartum depression, I guess they call it.  Right.  But we don't know why she did what she did?  Did she hear voices?  Yeah, maybe.  We still don't know why she did, right?  I don't know.  David Bowie is obviously the police chief down there.  Remember, those officers aren't getting any paychecks with the government shutdown. 
[00:54:30]  They are essential employees, which requires them to be there.  Elizabeth, Brian, Steve, back.  Wait, what is essential?  So you're essential, but you still don't get paid in?  Right.  So what?  They're going to pay you eventually?  I guess retroactive.  Oh, okay.  Radioactive.  It just popped in my head, and it came out of my mouth.  I felt compelled to say it.  Well, now that we're talking about the D.C. nut job, we might as well do this clip right 
[00:55:00]  here.  Of course, Alex Jones has a different take on this.  Does he?  He's got a huge audience, man.  Huge audience of people believing every word he says.  This is his take.  It's quick.  Shots fired, U.S. Capitol.  Oh, they're pulling a big distraction on us.  We're going to go to break.  I just canceled our guest that's coming up, so I can get to everybody's calls.  Frank, I appreciate you.  We're going to get to everybody else and cover these shots when we come back.  But look for him to stage a bunch of stuff. 
[00:55:30]  Ochenek, who's really got his ear to the ground, he says the Navy Yard was a staged event, and  he has sources.  So look for more of that to happen very, very soon to change the subject, because everything  the globalists do is falling apart right now.  False flag.  That's what he's saying.  This was a staged event to distract us.  Big distraction.  And the Navy Yard shooting was a staged event, too?  What events does he think are real? 
[00:56:00]  That's what I'm curious about.  When is it as it appears?  Never.  Sometimes shit just happens.  Yeah.  Crazy broad.  By the way, how do you get a woman with a one-year-old?  I know he'll say mind control, but how do you say, look, we need you to take the baby  and ram the White House?  Right.  And why do they go to a dental hygienist from Connecticut?  It's obviously a Manchurian candidate type of situation.  Why?  To throw us off, Jimmy, because, you know.  Okay, so they want someone to...  But the government, I mean, we all know the government is sick in general, but they're 
[00:56:30]  so sick they're going to involve a one-year-old in a false flag event.  Actually, the one-year-old is the principal player in it.  Actually, the one-year-old had swallowed explosives.  Okay, the boyfriend said...  You ever see Finster from the Bugs Bunny cartoons?  Finster, everybody thought Finster was a baby, but Finster was actually the crook, the mastermind,  and Bugs Bunny couldn't even really deal with Finster, baby. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, Finster, baby.  Finster, baby.  Naughty, baby.  The boyfriend said she was acting delusional.  She knew her home was under surveillance.  She's just a fucking nut.  But, you know, I guess the conspiracy theorists will see it.  But that's all fine.  That's part of it.  Right.  Because that's what they do.  They get you to think your home is under surveillance.  So you'll drive and ram the White House.  Sure.  And the dental hygienist, that's who you get to do it.  Obviously.  Obviously.  Well, now Jimmy's got to be killed. 
[00:57:30]  He just spilled the beans.  I think it's time for another Alex Jones call.  Oh, God.  Definitely.  It's been too long.  He's fucking exhausting.  He don't make no sense.  Oh, wow.  Even Chip doesn't think he makes no sense.  Wow.  All right.  I guess we did it.  So that's all we know so far about what went down in D.C.  False flag.  Alex Jones thinks it's some kind of false flag.  He loves saying false flag. 
[00:58:00]  Yes, he does.  Go for Tonkin.  False flag operation.  Oh, really?  Look at these fucking guys.  Pelosi.  Go for Tonkin toy.  What?  Harry Reid.  Hold on.  Question about budget.  And, of course, if you're going to have a fight over the budget, over the debt ceiling.  I hate that debt ceiling.  I don't know anything about it.  The debt ceiling?  Well, in a few days, if they don't raise the debt ceiling, then we default on our loans for the first time ever, ever. 
[00:58:30]  And we don't have that, you know, 100 A-plus rating.  I thought we lost that already.  No, as far as like...  I thought we lost the A-plus.  No, we lost like the fucking, um, our rating with one of the, like, who is it?  Standard and Poor's or something like that.  But, yeah, our credit rating will drop because of, um, we won't pay the interest on our loans.  But all we have to do is raise the debt ceiling.  Yes.  That's kind of cool. 
[00:59:00]  We have to raise the old debt ceiling.  So we just decide, you know what, let's just raise it again.  But it has to be voted on and, um...  When...  They're not really talking to each other.  When does it get to a point where we can't just raise the debt ceiling anymore?  Opie, you can raise it as often and as high as you like.  That seems to be what they do.  Seems like the whole world's in debt, so how about we just make it a wash?  Just fucking cancel all fucking debts with everyone.  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  We're living on this planet, so we all just go, hey, man, let's just make this a fucking wash. 
[00:59:30]  I've lent people some money and then said, you know what, forget it.  Exactly.  Meh, why can't they do that?  Why can't China do that with the United States?  Yeah, the damn Chiners.  Yeah, that shit.  We'll keep buying your fucking rubber dog shit and vomit and, uh, you forgive our debts.  I love that we've broken down their entire economy.  Yes.  Fucking rubber dog shit.  Rubber dog shit, fucking trick gum and hand buzzers.  That's all the Chiners make. 
[01:00:00]  Chinermen.  The Chinermen.  The Chiners.  The Chiners.  Stupid Chiners.  Yeah.  I told you they were coming years ago.  No one wanted to believe me.  They're coated with some type of narcotic to lull us into a false sense of security.  The Chiners.  The good old Chiners.  They coat their rubber dog shit and vomit.  In lead paint to, uh, to deform our children.  Oh, you know what?  We could do this club now, too.  Fuck it.  We could clear the field to do a little jocktober. 
[01:00:30]  Don't play with the dirty money.  I got Finster stuck in my head.  God, that was a great fucking episode.  I got to get the original, uh, Bugs Bunny cartoon.  Finster!  Finster shaven and tattooed.  Remember he was on the fucking stool?  Oh, yeah.  Meh, shaven.  He had a cigar in his mouth.  Meh, got a fucking-  Can you find that clip?  The anchor on his chest tattooed.  Big muscles.  Right.  And then he would, like, he would fall down and go, da-da.  Right.  And Bugs would be like, oh, that's adorable.  I fucking love that one. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, he looked like a real tough guy shaven.  I got to get the originals, because the edits are horrendous on the Cartoon Network.  Yeah.  They edit them?  They edit everything out.  Oh, dude, they edit them.  If you watch Wabbit Season, Duck Season, you won't even fucking recognize it.  They never show a gun.  Daffy being shot in the face.  Or they show the gun, but it's never, yeah.  Never fired.  Right.  You're like, why is, um, no, that's I want East Egg.  That's not Finster.  Editing cartoons.  What a dumb fucking cartoon.  Oh, yeah, they're editing them. 
[01:01:30]  Big time.  Did you put in Finster, baby?  Yeah.  Bugs Bunny Finster?  Call him Sam.  Finster!  You hear what I said?  That's a good one, Chip.  Fuck yeah, it was.  Beyond the look of-  Oh, what was his real name?  What was Finster's real name?  You know I'm not going to be a help here.  Oh!  Something Harry.  Harry?  Yeah, I think it was, right?  Be on the lookout for Ant Hill Harry.  Wow, very good.  Yeah.  It was Ant Hill Harry. 
[01:02:00]  Wow, fuck.  That was Finster.  We got the Finster clip?  A.K.A. Baby Face Finster.  Baby Face Finster.  I love that one.  That one, and I wouldn't put Rocky in this stove.  Yeah, that's a classic.  Classics.  Anyway, one more clip about D.C.  Of course, the government shutdown continues, but you've got Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell  agree they think they're going to win while they're mic'd.  Oh boy, that hot mic.  You've got to watch the hot mics, people. 
[01:02:30]  But I guess they knew they were on.  Well, the guy-  They knew they had their mics and that someone would pick up their shit.  Mitch McConnell knew he had a mic on, and he said, I'm all wired up.  Right.  So they both knew that they had a lapel mic on, so it's like, at that point, whether  you know you're being recorded or broadcast or whatever, you'd think they've been doing  this long enough to not say some dumb shit with mics on.  Right?  Well-  You'd think.  I think Rand Paul could be a superstar down there in D.C., right?  I like his father. 
[01:03:00]  I don't like him as much.  Maybe.  You don't like Rand as much?  Nah, I prefer Ron.  Well, Ron's a bit old now, though.  Yeah, man, he is.  So Rand is your only hope.  My only Paul.  Yeah, you-  Do you have a second?  I'm all wired up here.  I just didn't see it in.  I just go over and over again, we're willing to compromise, we're willing to negotiate.  I don't think they poll-tested, we won't negotiate.  I think it's awful for them to say that over and over again.  Yeah, I do, too.  And I just came back from that two-hour meeting with him, and that was basically the same view 
[01:03:30]  privately as it was politically.  I think if we keep saying, we wanted to defund it, we fought for that.  But now we're willing to compromise on this.  I think they can't.  We're going to-  I think-  Well, I know we don't want to be here, but we're going to win this, I think.  Wow.  Huh.  That's pretty interesting, huh?  A little strategy meeting.  Right.  Yep.  What are you going to do?  That shit's going down all the time down there.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, imagine if he dropped the N-bomb.  Wow.  What do you-  Well, if I'm miked, oh boy. 
[01:04:00]  I really got to watch out.  They think, you know, whispering will not be picked up by the mics, though.  Yeah, you know.  Oh, I don't really.  Did you, uh, did you vote for the fag weddings?  Did you vote for that shit?  Because, uh, let me tell you, I don't need any of that crap.  Right.  Fucking, fucking fags fucking each other in the ass.  They can crucify me in my district.  I need that.  I don't know.  I'm portrayed as a fag lover. 
[01:04:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Fucking.  Don't need it.  And then we got to deal with the head nigger in charge.  I'm not fucking dealing with that shit.  It's bad enough having to deal with the spics porn over the border, but fuck.  Holy fuckaroni.  God damn.  Did you get that child porn I sent you?  Yeah, exactly.  My hard drive's fucking overflowing with it. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Wait, let's do the whisper thing again.  All right, Chip.  Go ahead.  God, you do it first.  I hope those fucking chaps aren't, uh, taking over.  Don't say that, you miked.  Fuck.  I don't know.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will return in a moment.  After all, millionaires have to piss, too. 
[01:05:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Good job, Travis.  Whoa, good job.  There's a reason for this.  Get yourself together.  Yeah, you.  So you think you're taking it back down?  Because you know it's coming after all your back of time. 
[01:06:00]  You thought I can't help you.  I was going to call this the biggest mistake in Ryan for all history, but I think they had no choice.  Why?  17 years ago.  17 years ago.  Gary Cherone joins Van Halen.  Holy shit.  That was 17 years.  And I think Gary Cherone gets a lot of shit, but he's got a great voice.  He's trying to sound like Sammy right there.  He's a very good guy.  I just don't think the songs were strong enough. 
[01:06:30]  The songs weren't strong enough, but his voice wasn't alive either.  Whose fault was that?  Did Gary Cherone write a lot of this stuff?  I don't know.  For Van Halen 3, meaning third singer?  Weren't they trying to go with that angle too?  Like Van Halen 3 or I don't know.  He's trying to sound like Sammy.  Well, of course, because they were so successful with Sammy Hagar.  They didn't want people to notice.  But.  Notice too much anyway.  Too much.  You would think this is Sammy Hagar, right?  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  But live, he couldn't do this.  We saw him.  Blow his voice out.  Meanwhile, Sammy could fucking do this in his sleep.  It was a BCN gig, I believe.  We went to.  Yeah.  River Rave, I think.  This hit number one on the rock charts.  Did it?  Yeah.  Well, because there was a lot of anticipation.  But the whole thing just fell apart.  It's not that bad, I guess. 
[01:07:30]  When you look at Van Halen 3, yeah, this fits right in.  Have we ever asked David Lee Roth about Gary Cherone?  He probably would just start talking about himself.  Talking about Japan.  Yeah, Gary Cherone.  Yeah, I know about that, dude.  Let me tell you what happened back in 1979 when we were.  Raise your hand if you're still in with David Lee Roth.  Bozy, bozy, bop.  I'm the only one?  It's down to me?  I like David.  I just didn't do it.  He's a bit much for three hours.  I've had it.  Travis? 
[01:08:00]  I liked him the first time he came out.  I'm so in still.  It's because you guys weren't here when it was just me, Jim, and DLR in the studio.  DLR.  It was a bit rough.  It was a bit rough, that one?  The audience didn't respond all that well to that.  I called in for like the first hour of that show because I was home.  Yeah.  And the second I heard like, oh, David Lee Roth's here, click.  I fucking punched right out because I knew.  First of all, I wasn't going to go to get word in edgewise, and I really wasn't interested. 
[01:08:30]  You stopped listening to your own show.  I hung up on my own show.  That's funny.  And we lost Janis Joplin.  Are you kidding?  No, of course, she died at the age of 27, 43 years ago.  How did it happen?  She'd only be 70.  That's kind of old for, you know.  Yeah, but she's been dead forever.  She has been dead forever.  She's been dead certainly for my entire life. 
[01:09:00]  How many years ago?  43.  What?  So for my entire life, Janis Joplin's been dead.  Yes.  Yep.  And I was hearing on the news today, she was only around for three years.  That's it.  Yeah, yeah.  A quick three-year career.  What was that?  And now she's a legend.  I remember when Pearl came out.  No, you don't.  Her album Pearl.  You don't remember when Pearl came out.  I do.  That's impossible.  Sure he does.  He drove to buy it.  No, I know because my mom picked it up and would play it on the big sarcophagus-like turntable 
[01:09:30]  combination radio, eight-track player fucking garage door opener.  I think in honor of Janis Joplin's death, we got to play Anthony's mom singing Bobby McGee.  Oh, my God.  I think it's a must.  Do we have that little clip?  Remember that?  I don't disagree.  That's another clip.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We haven't played in a while.  That was a...  That certainly could be a nugget on the Opie and Anthony podcast.  That was a good one.  The old karaoke.  Whew.  Oh, boy.  You got that.  I thought I did.  I don't... 
[01:10:00]  Eric must have...  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock's like fucking...  Why would it be in Dillette?  In more ways than one, he's like fucking Newman in Jurassic Park.  Did you find it online, Sam?  Uh, uh, uh.  Seems like...  Uh, uh, uh.  Seems like all our shit is online.  Now, of course, he's got the Drew Boogie edited version, but I don't know why.  That's kind of fun, too, but...  Well, I don't know.  I think we want the raw version today.  Yeah.  If he could find it.  If he wasn't vacationing, we would have it. 
[01:10:30]  We might have to call E-Rock on vacation.  I needed something from him.  I emailed him yesterday.  Did he get back to you?  No, I emailed him late, so he probably didn't see it yet.  He should get back to you, though.  He's quite busy.  He might be making love.  What's he doing?  To a sandwich.  He's in fucking...  Let's see.  He's in taking up a lot of Space Mountain.  It's a large waistband, after all.  He's not even here.  Oh, you know.  He should have been here today to defend himself. 
[01:11:00]  Yes, yes, yes.  Fuck, hold on a minute.  I know.  Going through all the rides in my head right now.  Trying to get one.  Yeah.  Put into an automated voice messaging system.  Damn it.  Two.  Who's that?  It's not available.  Oh.  E-Rock.  At the tone, please record your message.  Is that his number?  When you finish recording, you may hang up or press one for more.  No way.  I don't think... 
[01:11:30]  I don't think that will get it.  I think that was a little late.  Oh, no.  What did you do?  I think he just gave out E-Rock's phone number.  No one's going to believe I didn't mean to do that.  Fuck.  I was looking going...  I swear I didn't mean to do that.  I'm going to...  I thought you were letting the numbers play out.  He is going to kill you.  Fuck.  Nobody will call. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, no.  I'm on so much allergy shit.  Do you want it taken out of the replay?  Of course.  Maybe.  Oh, my God.  It's too late.  It's going to be on Twitter.  It's going to be on every website.  It's going to just fucking...  And believe me, the listeners will be so nice to him.  Hey, fatty.  How many slobos is he going to get?  You're pushing it forward now, sir.  I didn't give it out.  You're pushing it forward.  You know how many messages?  You have 163 messages. 
[01:12:30]  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Slobbo!  Did we get it in time?  Oh, my Lord.  I don't think so.  We rarely hit that dump button.  I hit it for all it was worth, and I don't think...  Ask the people down below.  Or are they listening to the...  No, they listen to the direct feed, so no matter what, they're going to get it.  Seriously?  They get it through my headphones.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no. 
[01:13:00]  They're the privileged few that hear my exact headphone feed.  They actually hear Travis go, three minutes.  Oh, really?  Oh, the magic.  They hear the magic.  Can they hear this?  Peck-a-juice!  They heard that.  Well, useless.  Just useless, too.  I didn't mean to do that.  He's not going to believe me, but he's not.  I literally thought you were just teasing it, like giving out the first three.  No, I wasn't.  I was thinking about what I wanted to say. 
[01:13:30]  I had some terrific things to say in his voicemail that would have made everyone laugh.  Hopefully.  What were you thinking as the numbers going out?  I was just thinking.  I was focusing on what I wanted to say.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Oh, no.  I have to know what you were going to say now.  No, it doesn't matter.  Oh, my God.  I'll go check if it made it through or not.  He's going to have to change this.  What do you mean?  They already said it through that part.  That's all that matters.  That part is enough.  Well, not really.  Really?  Yeah, they're pretty cool.  They're the elite. 
[01:14:00]  Well, tell the elite to do the right thing, please.  Yeah, they could be nice.  See?  We can be nice.  I'm begging, actually, because I really did not mean to do that.  That's really shitty of me.  Oh, boy.  That's really shitty of me.  Fuck.  He's going to have to change his number now.  Oh, no.  He's never going to believe you didn't do that on purpose.  I know.  He's going to think.  I know.  Why?  Why would my number two hero do that to me? 
[01:14:30]  Wow.  Where did Sam go?  Because we found your mom doing me and Bobby McGee.  Oh, my God.  Where is that?  That's a...  Oh, I think that was my birthday.  That was at my birthday party, right?  Was that at Pianos?  I don't know where that was.  I kind of remember that.  I think it was my birthday.  I brought that chick from fucking Akron with the fucking dress and the combat boots.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:15:00]  I remember her.  Oh, yeah.  Boy.  What happened?  Hi, Sal.  Hi.  Oh, Sal's here.  What up, Sal?  Save the day.  All right, anyway.  So, Janis Joplin, I feel like shit right now.  That was not cool.  Eh, what are you going to do?  Uh, Janis Joplin died 43 years ago today at the age of 27.  So, you got Ant's mom from a few years back.  Yeah.  Singing Me and Bobby McGee.  With Joe and Dawn, I think. 
[01:15:30]  I've never seen this.  It's a shitty version.  Oh, you don't want me.  You don't want me.  Oh, Bobby McGee.  No, it's too shitty.  It made it on air, according to Twitter.  Uh-oh.  And when someone said...  According to Twitter, as they quote the number?  No, no, no.  I heard it in my car, and I can rewind it to hear it again.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Kevin O'Brien.  I've already tried to call him ten times.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:16:00]  This is bad, Opie.  This is bad.  Fuck.  Oh, well.  Oh, boy.  The dump didn't work.  I dumped out immediately after you said it, and I just listened to the iPhone app, and  it didn't work.  The dump did not work.  At all?  Or did it dump later?  I saw it roll.  I saw it count back to eight. 
[01:16:30]  So, it must have dumped, but we dumped too late.  No, I didn't...  I don't...  I don't hear anything.  There was no dump at all?  No.  So, the dump doesn't work?  Dump doesn't work, Iraq.  The dump doesn't work.  But let it be wrong.  Oh, here comes Mars now.  Here comes Mars.  I believe the dump does work.  I guess we get...  Damn, that's a good dump.  No, we work in the dump.  I hit the dump button.  Yes, this is a dump.  Now, Mars is running into your studio, Travis.  Yeah, that's fine.  I mean, I hit the dump button.  Sam, are you upset that it went out over the air?  It's unfortunate that it went out over the air. 
[01:17:00]  That's pretty funny.  Somebody says he's going to change his outgoing voicemail message to Opie's phone number.  Oh, shit.  If you're trying to get in touch with me, please call me.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  That's fucking...  No, the destroyer...  All right.  I don't even know what...  Fucking assholes.  Oh, jeez.  Don't worry.  No one will call. 
[01:17:30]  Mars, I blame you.  The dump button didn't work.  Oh, it did work.  It did work.  Yes.  But I don't know.  Travis says they didn't cut out what it was supposed to, so I don't know.  I hit it a little late.  I was stunned.  I was looking at Opie, and then Opie goes, hit it.  So I hit it, but it was probably too late.  I didn't know that was E-Roc's number.  I didn't know what you were doing.  I didn't either.  I thought you were doing a bit like you called up something else.  Oh, I was doing the cold call.  And I was going to, in my way, tell them we were looking for something.  That's all. 
[01:18:00]  Why would you have your dumb number on the fucking thing?  I do.  Do you?  It's automatic.  Oh, the automatic default voicemail.  Right.  No, you got to do it.  Hi, you've reached Anthony.  I'm not giving my number out.  Leave a message after the beepy tone.  Is that what your voicemail says?  Yeah.  I don't know what it says.  Can't leave a voicemail on my phone.  No?  Nope.  Why?  You disabled?  Yeah, for five years. 
[01:18:30]  Damn.  You can't leave a voicemail.  Thanks to dear old mom.  Well, E-Roc's going to need to know that feature.  What happened?  The dump, it kicks in.  And it literally, it dumped right after the last number.  Oh.  So it goes from the full phone number to, I don't think that'll get it.  Oh, we just missed it.  Oh.  Although even if the last number was cut off, people would, they would hunt, they would 
[01:19:00]  hunt around for the valuable E-Roc number.  Yeah, but they wouldn't know which was his though, so they would, they would just.  Well, that's true.  They would leave Slobo on 10 fucking numbers.  Slobo.  He's never going to believe.  Oh no.  Oh my God.  Someone on Twitter said, definitely just left a message saying, the Opster sent me Slobo.  Oh no. 
[01:19:30]  Look at this.  Please do not send, do not text Slobo cockpicks.  What are you doing?  I'm just reading people's like, they want to help.  And they're saying what not to do with his number.  You're pushing this forward, but I'm going to get so much shit.  Oh, no.  Oh no.  It's already a meme.  Oh no.  It's a topless picture of E-Roc. 
[01:20:00]  It's got his phone number at the top and then it says, call me ladies.  Oh no.  What a horrible picture.  Oh, I want to feel up E-Roc.  It's like nice cans.  Oh no.  Disney vacation is ruined.  It's ruined.  He'll be trying to just like, you know, figure out what to do.  All these texts will pop up.  Oh God. 
[01:20:30]  Oh no.  That's great.  Wonderful.  They'll be nice to him.  I'm sure.  Always in it.  I'm always in it.  Always in.  Always bad.  Oh, Jordy Verrill.  You know what's real funny?  There's three dump buttons.  You got one.  I don't have one.  Yes, you do.  It's on the board.  It's on the board.  It says dump.  Where?  I don't have one.  I swear to God, I did not know that. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, you have one over there.  Yes, I do.  Where?  Oh, right there.  Does that work?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, I had no idea.  I'm serious.  I had no idea.  Oh, jeez.  Where's the third one?  Trev's.  Oh, so you're saying nobody hit it?  No one.  That's funny?  Yes.  I wasn't sure if I, like, I thought it was a bit.  I honestly didn't think of dumping because I thought it was a bit. 
[01:21:30]  I swear.  No, I thought it was, like, a fake note.  I thought you were like, oh, I'll call E-Rock, and you dialed, like, some fucking store somewhere,  and the numbers started coming up.  No, look, I have no problem making it hurt.  I think most people know that, but I absolutely did not do that on purpose.  Period.  I don't think you did.  You don't got to sell me, though.  You got to sell a poor, hurt boy whose hero gave out his fucking phone number to a bunch of fucking degenerates.  Poor Chubster on vacation.  He's been trying to enjoy himself. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, my God.  Just getting phone call after phone call while he's on rides.  He's going to pull out his phone and be like, oh, sweetie, I have this Disney app to see what, wow, so many messages.  I hope everything's okay.  Slavo!  Fuck.  This is a bad one.  The Wiggles are doing the propeller in front of Fox News.  Yay!  Do the propeller.  Do the propeller.  Round and round.  Yay!  Beautiful guy in New York City. 
[01:22:30]  So we're going to go flying up into the sky.  Oh, yeah.  I bet you could fly twinsel toes.  Be back here.  Where's a remote helicopter when you need it?  Right?  Come on!  Yeah!  All right.  Going up and up and up and up and up.  We're going down and down and down.  Down on each other.  We're going up.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Freeze.  Propeller.  Yeah, throw the propeller.  I grab it and I swing it like that. 
[01:23:00]  Not with your dick, Uncle Paul.  Put that away.  Kiss the propeller.  No, Uncle Paul, they're using their hands, not their penises.  Kiss the propeller.  Uncle Paul, put that away.  Up we go.  Yay.  No, that's disgusting.  The propeller's spitting on you.  To the leaky propeller.  Yeah, let's pull the up.  Is Earl coming off it?  Can you give me the nose cone?  Okay.  I'll be the driver.  Look at the five people watching.  Yay, they're doing a plane.  How sad is that? 
[01:23:30]  They cannot get an audience in front of Fox and Friends.  No.  They're trying to go for, what, the Today Show or something.  Every morning they've got some little thing going on and no one stops by.  You're right, there's four or five people with their arms folded.  Yeah.  Do the propeller.  That's a good one.  Yeah, it is.  Everyone's got their arms all out.  Swinging them in a cycle.  The Wiggles live.  Thank God.  My kid's not into the Wiggles.  That's a good thing.  What age do they start getting into the Wiggles? 
[01:24:00]  Usually nine months, sometimes ten.  And they listen to them up until about four or five.  The chick's kind of cute.  Sure she is.  Oh, no.  Now look, the news people are involved.  Do the propeller.  Do the propeller.  Oh, stiff.  Do you believe that?  How much?  They're terrible.  The government is shut down, right?  I think so.  And Fox and Friends are spending time with the Wiggles.  Yes.  Oh, that's good.  I hear Muhammad Atta singing that.  Oh, my God. 
[01:24:30]  People are fucking out of work, but let's get the Wiggles on Fox and Friends.  All right.  Do the propeller.  Oh, look, boy.  Dr. Lydia.  What?  Oh, God.  We thought you were dead.  We haven't heard from you in a while.  Hoped.  I heard her on Jimmy's after show once.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Giving Jimmy massive kudos for his ability to help people through some of their problems.  Someone said, I got a problem drinking.  So I says, put it up to your lips. 
[01:25:00]  Sound advice.  The Jimmy's advice show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I forgot how annoying your voice was.  But how great her giant fucking tits are.  Yeah.  How are your jugs?  How are those big fucking tits?  I know it's very annoying when I tell you things you don't want to hear.  How are your jugs?  They are beautiful.  Thank you so much for asking. 
[01:25:30]  Okay, Mr. Madison.  Go ahead, Lydia.  Well, I just, I've been staying out of your hair, guys, but.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What is that?  Yes, you are.  What is that?  That's my GPS.  Opie, you know you did this on purpose, whether you can admit it or not.  Wow.  Oh.  Wow, she's saying you did this on purpose.  Deep down. 
[01:26:00]  Explain.  Well, Opie, subconsciously or unconsciously, you must be very mad at Eric because you really screwed him this time.  What?  You really screwed him this time.  That was not a nice thing to do.  But the other day, I cold called him as well, and the voicemail popped up, I thought.  No, you would have.  Or did I just sit?  Really?  Yeah.  Are you saying that subconsciously?  Are you saying subconsciously?  Subconsciously, I wanted the number to get out, right? 
[01:26:30]  I'm saying that there are no real mistakes.  Turn right on to a little country road.  Except calling a radio show while your GPS is loud.  Right.  You can't figure out how to get to work yet?  You mental patient?  Drive off a cliff.  Yeah.  Or go down to the White House and just aim for the fence.  Where the hell are you going?  You need GPS today.  GPS is off.  I'm very sorry.  But where are you going that you need your GPS?  I am going to a conference on education and the law and mental illness. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, good.  Oh, boy.  Well, she is fighting the good fight out there.  Yes.  You know, we got the crazies all over the place.  Fucking tase them.  Yeah, what's your suggestion?  Tase the mentally ill.  Keep them all drugged up or tase them?  Yeah, suited.  Those are your two choices.  What do you think?  You know, I've been following your conversation on guns and the mentally ill, and I really do  have to agree with anything.  Guns and the mentally ill?  No.  Of course.  I know everything about guns and mental illness.  I think...  Picking guns for the mentally ill.  No, I think mental illness is a much bigger problem in America than guns. 
[01:27:30]  I absolutely believe that.  Exactly.  And every once in a while, you get a fucking whack job that does get their hands on a gun.  But we don't talk about all the other shit these fucking psychos do.  With bricks and, you know, a scissor.  Pipes.  Pipes.  Giving out numbers.  Pushing.  Right.  You fuck.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:28:00]  Poor Iraq.  Wow.  It's going to be brutal.  I didn't do it on purpose, Lydia.  I'm going to be so mad at you.  No one's going to believe me.  I get that much.  But I didn't do it on purpose.  I didn't do it subconsciously.  None of that shit.  Your voicemail box is full.  I just wasn't thinking.  So is your belly.  You say that, Opie.  But the thing about the unconscious is it hides even from you.  Oh, God.  Sounds like a monster.  The unconscious hides even. 
[01:28:30]  Your subconscious hides from you.  Sounds like a movie trailer tag.  Yeah.  Does it?  Does it really?  Yeah.  The unconscious doesn't tell us.  What are you hiding from, Lydia?  That you had to get giant jugs at 55 years old?  Oh!  Oh!  What are you hiding from?  Yeah.  What are you hiding behind those fucking giant chest balloons?  I can go toe-to-toe with any one of you fucking shrinks.  Let's do this.  Not with her.  You've got to stand back because we're big pits.  Right.  You can't even get toe-to-toe with her.  What are you hiding from? 
[01:29:00]  I'm not hiding from anything.  How about just...  I'm sorry.  That was uncalled for.  How about a titty fuck just as pals?  Mm.  Come on.  He's in Florida.  Why are you still?  You still?  After all this...  I think you really need to look honestly at true feelings about Eric.  Oh, you know what?  We got someone from your past on the line.  Little bit of your past on the radio.  You might remember this. 
[01:29:30]  We haven't talked to this individual in quite a long time.  Bill Tetley.  Irving.  Hello.  Oh, Lydia.  You...  Notes.  Hi, Lydia.  Remember me?  Oh, right.  Irving.  Irving.  I knew Irving, but I thought you were dead.  I'll never be dead while you're alive, sweetie.  Remember the bikini?  Remember I made you wear that bikini?  That wasn't a mistake either.  Oh, God.  Remember you rubbed yourself up against my bikini when I was a little girl. 
[01:30:00]  You are a terrible man.  Wow.  Do you think about me as much as I think about you?  Oh, my God.  This is so coolish.  No, it ain't.  Oh, sorry.  Well, Irving is claiming he was the one that rubbed up against Lydia when Lydia was a young  gal.  Yes.  Right, Irving?  Walking around like a little fucking slut in her bikini.  Oh, yeah.  Asking for it.  Just asking for it.  Exactly.  With her non-growing boobs that she would eventually take care of. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Boobers.  Do you remember me?  Do you remember me, Lydia?  I do.  Oh, God.  Unfortunately, this is...  When you close your eyes at night, do you think about me, Lydia?  No, I don't.  You were gross and smelly, and you didn't even get hard.  Oh, Jimmy.  That was your fault.  That was your fault. 
[01:31:00]  Jesus.  I kept trying to kiss you, and you were like Uncle Paul, the sardine earl on your lips.  Oh, God.  I couldn't get up because of my medication.  It doesn't allow me to function sexually.  Oh.  My diabetes medication.  It's a side effect?  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm flaccid.  Aw.  Well, I did have some luck, I guess.  All right, Irving.  Thanks for the memories. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Bye, Lydia.  I'll be watching you.  Oh.  That's so great.  I couldn't read this today.  How old were you, Lydia, when that happened?  Seven.  Jesus.  Seven?  Yeah, all of a sudden, you're an innocent victim, huh?  Oh, my God.  Goddamn liar.  Liar.  Jesus.  You big faker.  That's how I saw it.  Other people may see it differently.  Yes.  Yeah.  Right here, yeah.  I couldn't resist the shot, Opie. 
[01:32:00]  I'm sure it was my mistake, but I don't think he'd not see it that way.  There are no mistakes, I thought.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's it.  What if you're just tired and not thinking straight?  It's always got to be some weird psychological fucking mumbo jumbo.  It can't just be, oh, he was phasing out a little bit as the number was playing.  Right.  How about I didn't get a good night's sleep, and how about I've been fucking sneezing and  congested for six straight days, and I'm on a whole bunch of algae bullshit? 
[01:32:30]  Lydia's not hearing it.  No, it has to be some fucking psycho babble.  Mumbo jumbo.  Right.  I might still use that.  Eric's number.  Numbo jumbo.  Mumbo dumbo.  If it was anyone but Eric's number, I might believe that.  But it has to be the subconscious, which also hides from you.  Sometimes a banana's just a banana.  Sometimes a donut's just a donut, Lydia.  That's right.  Not everything has to be a thing.  And sometimes a cigar is a big black man's cock in your mouth. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, sometimes a crulla is just a limp penis being shoved into your bikini box.  Bottoms.  Well, crulla.  Love it.  A little wrinkly.  Well, it has begun.  Uh-oh, what?  Iraq has texted me.  No, no he didn't.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  And then another text that just says asshole.  No way, really? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, he's not going to believe that.  I didn't do it on purpose.  Did you text him back?  Tell him to call the show.  What do you tell him?  Yeah, tell him to call him.  See how many call waitings he gets while he's on the phone with us.  Oh my God.  Call him, Travis.  Oh, no.  Then I'll call him Travis.  That ain't his name.  What the fuck?  He's pissed, man.  Of course he should be.  He's on vacation.  I know.  I can't even play this as a bid.  Of course he should be pissed.  Oh, no.  Opie, you should really think about how you can come clean with this to Eric and make 
[01:34:00]  it up to him as well.  You got to buy him a new phone and pay for his phone bill for the first year.  Jesus.  That's right.  It's crazy.  And only compliment his physique and his work ethic.  All those people that he knows, all the radio insiders and phone numbers, he's going  to have to fucking let all them know that he's got a new number.  I mean, the family's easy.  Family is easy.  But yeah, no, it's those people you rarely get in touch with.  Well, he'll have to keep this number.  I literally still get calls on my old phone.  He'll have to keep this number for a fucking year as he transfers over. 
[01:34:30]  You owe him $1,500, Opie.  I'm not listening.  I'm running him back.  Maybe more.  The right thing to do, Opie, would be to give out your phone number.  Be to fuck your tits.  Yeah.  That'd be the right thing to put a pecker between your bazongas.  Bazongas.  That would show out that you're willing to go through the same suffering that you are  putting him through.  What?  You have to give him $1,700. 
[01:35:00]  Fine.  Fine.  Whatever.  Yeah, Lydia's.  That's another option.  He's got big hooters.  The opster doesn't do conflict these days.  So how much?  $1,700?  Fine.  You do it?  Yeah, right now.  You give him a check?  No problem.  Okay.  Then if you give him $1,700, he can't be pissed at you anymore.  He will have to keep this number for a while, though.  That's where the $1,700 comes in.  Just for that reason.  Because Opie's got to pay his phone bill for a year and a new phone.  That should be covered in $1,700.  Mm.  Eric.  Jeez, that's a lot of money for a fuck-up. 
[01:35:30]  Well, it's a big one.  I don't know, Opie.  Money's an easy way for a multimillionaire to solve the problem.  $1,700.  God.  Who would go?  Listen to this.  Who would go to you for therapy?  Well, Lydia gets in there.  She likes to get in the brain and root around a little bit.  Lovely Lydia with her giant cans.  Her psych degree.  I just really enjoy the days when you're in the barrel, Opie.  What are you writing to E-Rock? 
[01:36:00]  It's private.  I'd like to know.  I think it's fair that we share this as a show.  I think it is, too.  I mean, his phone number's private, too.  The bodacious Lydia.  Oh, shit.  I wrote.  Dear Piggy.  Call in.  I swear I didn't do this on purpose.  I totally fucked up.  I was cold calling you to ask where we can finance mom singing Janis Joplin.  I know you're going to have a tough time believing this, but I just fucked up.  I really am sorry.  And tell him you owe him $1,700.  Oh, jeez.  Don't tell him that. 
[01:36:30]  Well, we'll save that for later.  Yeah, I mean, you know, last-ditch effort.  I mean, you don't open with that.  I mean, come on.  Right, right.  See how he takes that news.  Right.  And if he's very forgiving.  I called Eric on.  Eric has a work cell phone number, and I just called him, and I got through to him, actually.  And I said, hey, do you want to go on air because we're trying to fix the phone number?  Of course he doesn't.  He's pissed.  He goes, no, tell him, fuck him.  I'm done.  I'm done with that.  And then he just hung up right on me.  Oh, shit.  He needs to come.  Hold on.  It's not even do you want to go on air. 
[01:37:00]  There's an issue here, and I know why he's angry.  I don't blame him.  He should be angry.  But-  I'm not going to fucking play this differently.  I fucked up.  He has to come on the air.  He should come on the air.  I'll call him back right now.  But we're not going to attack him.  No, hell no.  But he hung up immediately, so I'm going to try to call him right back.  Tell him he's got to come on the air, and it will make sense to him.  It was just a mistake.  There's always some big thing that happens when he's on vacation.  Every time.  This is, like, the worst, though.  We usually just annoy him a little with a phone call to his hotel room or something.  Well, I mean- 
[01:37:30]  This one is just going to fuck with him for his whole vacation.  The rest of the vacation.  He probably thought that it would never get worse than you calling him and making whale  noises at him over the phone while he was on his honeymoon.  I was speaking in whale to E-Rock, yes.  This is worse.  Probably thought that was the worst thing that would happen.  And then Opie inadvertently gives out his phone number.  Lydia, we've got to reset the phones for some reason.  That's what I'm being told.  So thank you very much.  I actually appreciate your phone calls to the radio show.  Good job with phones today. 
[01:38:00]  They're Opie Jesus.  Yeah.  It's my pleasure.  I love talking to you guys.  Have a good day.  Shed up.  Of course you do.  All right.  You're a woman of lower stock.  Get over yourself.  Shed up.  Shut up.  Shed up.  Exactly.  Shed.  Are these pictures really Miley Cyrus or no?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they are.  These naked pictures?  Yeah, you see that shit?  Fantastic.  She's pulling her fucking bodysuit thing right into her pussy.  God.  Big, big nickels.  What were they for?  Yeah.  Terry Richardson does them. 
[01:38:30]  Who's he?  He's a very famous photographer.  God damn it.  She's sexy.  She's such a little fucking whore bag.  I love it.  She sticks her tongue out a lot.  She does that one eye shut and sticking her tongue out thing.  I don't know what the fuck that's all about.  She has a long fucking...  Stop doing it.  She has a long...  She looks like Justin Bieber now.  Very androgynous.  I was going to say, she creeped me out.  She's kind of going for some weird ladyboy look.  Androgyny.  She absolutely is.  And then Sinead O'Connor went after her a little bit.  Why?  Trying to give her advice.  It's like, Sinead O'Connor, really?  Fuck Sinead O'Connor.  She's another crazy one that did some crazy shit with her music career. 
[01:39:00]  Why is she giving Miley Cyrus advice?  Let's see, a pussy.  What the fuck just happened?  Look at that.  Wait, she does close her left eye a lot.  But you know what?  Miley Cyrus had a Disney image that she absolutely wants to shed into adulthood, and she did it.  She did.  Yeah, but she looks like a boy in the face.  It's creepy.  Oh, I love her.  Did you hear her interview?  She said she was not a hot mess.  Go down.  She was a strategic hot mess.  Hold on.  I believe she does.  Yeah, she knows exactly what she's doing.  She has no real hips.  She's not like Britney Spears going nuts and shaving her head and shit. 
[01:39:30]  No.  Miley Cyrus is doing exactly what she wants to do right here.  And she's got everyone fucking talking.  What do you think that tastes like, Jimmy?  It's probably a nice puss.  I mean, probably a little sweaty because she moves around a lot, and she's probably got  some nerve.  No.  No.  Can I see Sam if you can turn?  I'm nervous.  Thank you.  And I bet you her pussy lips were photoshopped out.  I'll bet you her pussy lips were showing, and they photoshopped them into a flat.  Yeah.  She's very fucking sexy. 
[01:40:00]  Whoa.  And the face is weird.  Oh, I love her.  She's beautiful.  And look, now in that picture, she's like saying, see, I got a dick.  Yeah, she's holding a fucking can.  Yeah, she's being goofy.  That's all.  She is goofy.  She's a goof.  She's a goof.  She's just, she gets, the Disney image is really hard to shed.  Yes, isn't that good after all?  She's very skinny.  She's a very slim girl.  Yes, is very flat.  How this guy got her to do these photos?  What do you think fucking Billy Ray is thinking about these? 
[01:40:30]  He's probably not happy.  No doubt.  Acky, breaky heart from his daughter, right?  Uh-oh.  You don't want to see that.  Oh, Sal's got something.  Eric told me to fuck off, and he said, fuck off, I'm done, and hung up again on me.  Wow, he's done.  Done with what?  The show?  What if he quits?  I can't keep him online any longer than that.  Nine years.  I'll try calling again.  I was listening to Sal.  Sal clearly explained that we want to explain what happened.  We don't want to attack you.  We just want to talk to you and let you know what happened.  And I heard Eric through the headset. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, boy.  Yelling in Sal.  Oh, Christ.  You are in Dutch now.  What if he quits the show?  Nine years.  It looks like a serious stock goes to $8.50.  Nine years to the day.  He ain't going to quit.  It's not a serious enough offense to quit.  It's just a horrible mistake.  What if he goes to HR?  Reports Opie.  What if he goes to FCC?  Yeah, he should go to OA. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, boy.  Poor man.  $1,700 for a clear conscience.  $1,700.  It's a lot.  Why $1,700, Sam?  Where are you coming with that figure?  Because you've got to buy a new phone, and you've got to give him enough money to pay  for the bills for a year, because he's got to keep the old phone, too.  No, I don't think it'll cost $1,700.  It's something you can get.  It didn't cost me that much to switch over.  It's going to be $100 a month, at least, for the bill.  I'll work the numbers on my own. 
[01:42:00]  That's $1,200.  I don't need you figuring out numbers.  $300 for a phone.  I'll crunch my own fucking numbers.  That's $15.  At least $100 a month is correct.  Absolutely.  I'll crunch my own fucking numbers.  It may be more than $17 if you crunch it.  Not how I do math.  You don't need unlimited data.  I'm good at fucking math.  We still got his work phone, too.  So what?  Oh, God.  I don't even know what phone.  I guess.  I don't even think I have his work phone number. 
[01:42:30]  His personal number.  Right.  No, you gave out his personal number.  No, I know that now, but I don't even know if I have his actual work number.  Because he used to use the personal one for everything.  Not anymore.  No.  He ain't pretty no more.  What's his work number?  I'll attempt to call him off air.  Say it, Sam.  Call it like this.  Oh, no.  Oh, what?  Some people on Twitter? 
[01:43:00]  Jimmy.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Oh, seductive new phone number.  Big, beautiful women are waiting for your call.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This.  Oh, no.  And this is the.  There's.  Oh, shit.  Big, beautiful women are waiting for your call.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The first tweet I go to.  It's right there.  There it is again.  There it is again.  Every tweet.  Yeah, I wonder where they got that idea from.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:30]  Hmm.  People are saying the mailbox is full.  All right.  So you should just keep the mailbox full.  He's still going to get calls.  He can't use the phone anymore.  Yeah, they forget eventually.  Oh, boy.  Everybody's just posting it.  There it is again.  It's it's all over the Internet now.  What the fudge?  It's all over the Internet.  Yeah.  It's a nightmare.  People are not going to forget because every time he comes up, they're going to start sending 
[01:44:00]  the pictures again.  It's going to be a whole thing.  He's got to get a new phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got to get a new phone.  New bill.  Seventeen hundred.  There I will.  Well, that that was unexpected.  Fucking A.  Just an innocent little phone call to E-Rock.  He didn't even respond to my text messages.  No, he's very angry.  He's probably got a bunch more coming in.  Yeah.  He's on vacation with his wife.  He probably just had like a nice moment.  You know what it is?  They're probably up all night and she was questioning why he can't achieve an erection. 
[01:44:30]  Why would you say that?  And he's just eating because he's just eating fucking like a steak.  He's making steak on a portable hot plate.  And she's like, why do you keep losing your erection?  Jesus.  You can't have any reprieve?  His phone number was just given out.  That is true.  He's, uh, yeah.  Poor boy.  He's very, he's very angry.  I'm a big E-Rock fan.  As everyone knows.  Yeah.  I'm a big supporter of Eric.  Yeah.  I do like teasing him, but I do.  Oh, we love him. 
[01:45:00]  He's invaluable.  We've said it a million times.  None of this matters.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not.  It doesn't.  It's all just.  Compliments are not going to help at this point.  There is another number here.  Should I?  You should call him.  See if he'll talk.  Good luck.  And tell him about the 1700.  Has been forwarded to an automated voice message.  Oh.  Well, try the other number.  See what happens.  What?  Try his other number?  I don't trust myself.  No, no. 
[01:45:30]  The first one.  I wouldn't either.  Try the one you gave out.  I did.  He's not going to answer.  No way.  No.  He's very angry.  Probably just shut the phone off at this point.  It's the only thing you could do.  Yeah.  And then when he turns it on, it's just going to be.  Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.  Slabbo, slabbo, slabbo.  All slabbo all day.  Poor guy. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's, let's do Chucktober after the break.  That sounds good.  So we can forget about this shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  We know you didn't do it on purpose.  It was a.  Well, tell him.  Tell him.  Because he's not going to believe it.  That was a weird moment, though.  Because we're so used to hearing numbers not given out on the air.  It was like watching something like.  I wasn't thinking.  No, I know.  Because I was thinking about what I wanted to say.  I was going for a little comedy.  I had a little dumb thing. 
[01:46:30]  I was going to say.  So I was like focusing on that.  A little comedy.  You wound up getting a lot of it.  I was waiting for the beep.  Yeah.  Not thinking.  What were you going to say?  It doesn't matter much.  Come on.  What was the message going to be?  Yeah.  Nothing.  Just for like a little fun.  Nope.  Maybe later if things calm down.  Yeah, it'll be alright.  Because it was going to be harsh, obviously.  God damn it.  So it's not even like.  I was going for some of that harsh comedy.  Yeah.  Your excuse.  So if I say that now, it's just.  No, it's just not a good spot to say.  You think people are texting photos? 
[01:47:00]  Can you stop?  I'm only asking.  I know they are.  Definitely.  See, this is a terrible predicament that poor Obi's in.  Because he's like, look, I did it by mistake.  And then E-Rock's going to be like, well, why are you calling me in the first place?  And Obi's going to be like, I wanted to leave a very rude message for you.  A rude, horrible message.  No, some harsh comedy, I call it.  Some harsh comedy.  Yes.  I wanted to leave some blue jokes.  It's a comedic style.  Well, can E-Rock just block the numbers on the new iPhone?  You can block numbers.  Every number?  Yeah, there's probably not that many.  A hundred. 
[01:47:30]  It's a lot.  It's a lot of numbers.  We were just getting over the fact about talking about how many listeners we have now versus  the first year or whatever.  It's way too many people calling.  You're welcome.  I don't think we come back from this one.  Oh, no.  You think that's it between you and E-Rock?  Yep.  I would think so.  I'd be so pissed.  You don't think this is fixable?  Even if it wasn't done on purpose?  It doesn't matter.  Because then it's like, how could I trust you with anything after that?  All right. 
[01:48:00]  Right?  True that.  Unless 1700 passes, you know.  I'm just saying.  Exactly.  He's one way to handle it.  It's 1700.  So what?  But he's working on it.  He's making a weight joke.  October is next.  Stay there.  Do you think it's getting to him all the fat jokes and stuff?  Seriously?  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, no.  Really?  Of course it is.  Do they have the fat horn bobsled at Disney World? 
[01:48:30]  Or is that just Disneyland?  It's Disneyland.  Oh, okay.  Why do you ask?  What?  Because we just said the fat jokes are probably getting to him.  Oh, oh.  Did you say Matterhorn?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought you said something else.  No, no.  I'm sorry.  Mm-hmm.  Because I feel bad now.  Because it's weird when you tease Iraq.  It's like, it's not Eric.  You're just teasing.  But I think it's so funny.  I mean, to break it down for a split second and be real for a second, I think it's hilarious  because he's not really fat.  He's not close to fat.  No.  That's what makes the bit so fucking funny. 
[01:49:00]  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, I could see it his way where it would be just an annoyance.  But he's heavier than he would like to be.  No, he don't give a fuck.  No, he does.  He eats whatever the hell he wants.  He cares.  He's caught in the fucking food thing.  And when you tell somebody a certain thing over and over again, it's not like they go,  oh, that's funny because it's not true.  Mm-hmm.  And also, it's like, I don't look at, like, when you're teasing somebody constantly, I  don't look at it like it's my friend Eric.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, it's just...  Well, after you tease them constantly, they don't look at you like my friend Jim. 
[01:49:30]  But, you know, but I mean, it's...  It's a character.  But we do look at each other that way because that's all people I know do is shit on each  other.  Yeah, yeah.  But I'm saying, you know, it's like when I say, like, if I do a joke about my mom,  I'm not thinking of my real mother.  It's just like, it's a title.  It's like, oh, my mother this or that.  It's like...  Yeah.  It's weird.  But, like, it's like, because you guys, well, we will say something on the air.  And then it's not just, like, people saying it to people.  It's now the entire audience wants to be in on the joke, too.  Yeah.  So now he's got, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of people that are in on this 
[01:50:00]  thing that's supposed to be between two friends.  And, yeah, that does tend to get to a person.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, if it got to him enough, wouldn't he be rail thin at this point?  You're blaming Eric.  Yeah.  Jesus!  Now, you're still...  Is there any, uh, are you looking at the, uh...  He yo-yos with his weight.  Yes, I am looking at the tweets. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, boy.  There's some deceptive tweets, too.  What do you mean?  People are, like, saying, like, hey, want to win One Direction tickets?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah, because he doesn't have any One Direction tickets.  No.  No.  No.  So these people are just calling.  He doesn't.  No.  Is he staying on site?  I believe so.  One of the resorts?  Yeah, I believe so.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  I think. 
[01:51:00]  I mean, I would.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Trying to think of resort names?  Trying to think of resort names.  Why?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know, because it could be funny.  The Yacht and Beach Whale Club?  Beach Whale.  The Yacht and Beach Whale Club.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Let's see.  Uh, yeah.  What is it?  Oh, these are screen grabs of. 
[01:51:30]  Iraq?  No, of what's being sent to his phone.  And there's a lot of listeners that now, first of all, they have Iraq in their phones.  Now he's a contact.  That's contact.  That's Iraq.  That's a screen grab.  What do they send him?  There's a picture of Clint Eastwood on stage at the RNC, and he's offering a plate of food  to Iraq sitting in that empty chair.  No, he's not sitting.  He's standing, and he's dressed as a giant chubby baby.  Oh, adorable. 
[01:52:00]  Which is, he's not.  He's an adult.  Oh, Jesus.  He's an adult.  This is so bad.  Yeah, and there's the One Direction contest.  This is, this might end up being more than $1,700.  Let's get easily.  And then there's punitive damages.  Psychological damage.  Get up to $2,500.  Sue everyone.  I was very hurt. 
[01:52:30]  My feelings.  What's that?  Yeah.  Basically a celebration going on on Twitter right now, which is-  Uh-huh.  They're not keeping it on the down low?  No.  No.  Anthony, it's not just the elite.  No?  No.  No, it's not.  All right.  Fuck.  All right.  It's going to be a rough point to come back from you.  Terry Schiavo does not have a Twitter. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, that's Terry Schiavo.  Terry Schiavo is-  She writes-  She just writes in the way she, uh, spoke.  Okay, uh, somebody is, uh, tweeting.  It's some mean fuckers.  Do you want your opinion of Obamacare to be heard?  Oh, no.  Call this number.  And then I guess that's the hashtag for whatever.  Poor E.  Are you texting him again?  I just, I just texted question marks. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, this one may take a while.  He's getting great cues today.  Oh, jeez.  He really does.  He rarely does the radio show.  He's doing it right now.  I would turn off my phone and try to enjoy Disney World.  Yeah, at that point.  I feel horrible because I know he's never going to believe that if it's just a really bad mistake.  And right now he's probably talking to his wife going, uh, uh-  What's my exit strategy here?  No, like, why the fuck is he doing that? 
[01:54:00]  What the fuck?  He's probably storming out of a vacation.  Ruining, ruining their day.  Should someone call her and say, just tell them that it wasn't a mistake?  Oh, I'm on it.  Oh, boy.  It wasn't a mistake.  I'm on it.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  I guarantee he's talking to his wife right now about leaving the show.  You think he's taking solace in food right now?  Why would you bring it up that?  Like, I don't understand.  Because a lot of people, you know, they kind of drown their sorrows and anger and whatnot  in various forms of addiction.  He's saying right now the fucking kitchen staff is on high alert.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They can't pump out enough Mickey-shaped pancakes. 
[01:54:30]  Waffles.  Waffles.  I think he's wearing, like, some Mickey ear hat.  Mickey ears.  No, I don't.  I think he's probably in a bad mood right now.  Oh.  And he's not putting on his Mickey hat.  It's like, damn it, now I'm just going to eat everything.  His phone number is on Twitter being associated with a fake contest that says win free tickets  to see gravity.  You think he's at Main Street, on Main Street USA and some of those candy shops and confectionaries  just shoving shit in his face? 
[01:55:00]  I think he's doing that?  I don't think he's depressed.  I think he's really mad.  Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, I think he's mad at this one.  I think he's thinking of retaliation.  I think he's possibly considering.  All right, Sam.  Jesus.  That's what I think is going on.  Fuck.  Well, Sam's just giving you an opinion on what might be happening.  That's the reality of the situation.  Yeah, yeah.  He wants to set the building on fire at this point.  Oh, shit.  Certainly hasn't done that with the business.  Oh.  Why would you bring it up? 
[01:55:30]  Is he going to put some kindling between his thighs?  Walk around?  Set the building on fire.  And it's just cruel.  It is cruel.  Because he knows, like.  And it's just cruel.  Because I could get these in, because these always will just come in second to Opie giving  out his phone numbers.  You're not good nature, Jim.  I know exactly what it is.  You think I've just started this shit?  You know you're on an empty highway right now.  You're on a completely empty highway.  Because it will never be as bad.  Of course.  That's what Opie did.  And Jim thinks that his.  What, you think I'm stupid? 
[01:56:00]  That's one thing I'm not, is stupid.  Jim thinks that his insults come across as cheeky and good nature.  They're all good nature.  None of them do.  Yes, they do.  Never.  I'm very likable.  It's going 100 miles an hour without a fucking cop in sight.  Not a care in the world.  I know.  I'm not dumb.  And it's blazing along.  Oh.  He's loving the fact that it'll never get back to him.  Oh.  Poor E.  Poor E.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[01:56:30]  That poor staff.  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  Well, this is going to put a damper on fucking Taco Day.  I'll tell you that much.  Well.  Well, I'll still eat.  Yeah.  And we're going to do Jack-tober next.  I do like that your way of getting out of accidentally attacking somebody is to find  somebody else to attack.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Like, we're trying to get out of this, oh, we just did something horrible to E-Rock.  Let's do something horrible to Jack-tober. 
[01:57:00]  I have no problem doing horrible things.  Right.  But the problem here is it was an absolute mistake.  A horrible mistake.  Yeah.  That's just one thing I just wouldn't consciously do.  No.  Oh, whatever.  Hmm.  All right.  And we got Dan Soder.  Very funny fucking comic outside the studio.  What, is he thirsty?  Nah.  I like Dan a lot, to be honest with you.  And he's playing the Stress Factory, I believe, this weekend.  Really funny fucking guy, man.  And a cool dude. 
[01:57:30]  See the picture of E-Rock going up into the Hammond-Swiss family Robinson treehouse?  Is that what it's called?  Yeah.  Do you think he enjoys a good Hammond-Swiss?  Oh.  Well, we all know he likes sandwiches.  Oh, he loves a good sandwich.  That's been documented.  But that's not what we're talking about.  Ah, right, right.  All right.  I told E-Rock, what E-Rock should do is just lose the weight and fucking, that's how you 
[01:58:00]  get rid of the joke.  That's a big fuck you to everybody right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I think nine years of incidents on this show have sucked every possible motivation  out of his body.  That's not true.  I've been very encouraging.  Ah, it's true.  What are you talking about?  You're a role model.  That's right.  Kaiser role model.  Jesus.  Anthony has passed another ten exits without a trooper in sight.  Kaiser role model. 
[01:58:30]  Empty fucking beer cans being thrown out the window.  Yeah.  That's what's happening.  Right.  Smooth sailing.  All green lights.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess, what, we come back to some Jacktober?  Sure.  That'll be fun.  We'll get our mind off of the fact that Opie completely destroyed E-Rock's little vacation.  Final day of vacation, too.  You don't strike me as having a problem having that on your mind, to tell you the truth. 
[01:59:00]  I could sleep like a baby right now.  He's cool.  Yes.  He's cool.  Is that going to ruin your weekend?  I probably will forget it the second I fucking leave the studio.  I won't even give it a thought.  But when E-Rock spilled his guts to you about...  Oh, jeez.  When a license plate from Arkansas came out?  I've seen it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  A deserted highway for Anthony Kumi is not a good thing. 
[01:59:30]  He was drunk on tequila, opened up his soul to you and said, I know you don't like me.  And you actually said that's not true.  That is terrible.  I hate you.  Look at this fucking homeboy.  He just opens up on a cop.  Wow.  That's scary, huh?  There's a video.  Is the cop dead or alive?  On the news.  No, he's alive.  Did he get hit?  I don't think so.  What highway was that on?  That's the video of the day.  I've seen it like five times already.  It sure looked like US 1, didn't it? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Like a big ocean on one side?  I don't know, though.  Pretty frightening.  This is how serious I am about this.  How XM are you?  If E-Rock will accept my apology, I will disable my Candy Crush.  Why?  How serious does that make to E-Rock?  That doesn't help him.  I'm obsessed with Candy Crush, and he knows that'll hurt.  I'm stuck on a level 350. 
[02:00:30]  I will say goodbye to Candy Crush.  Wow.  I will uninstall it right now.  Yeah, that's not a really...  I'll say this.  It's not really...  To make up for something like that, you don't remove a little treat from yourself.  A game, yeah.  A little guilty pleasure.  If you forgive me, I won't eat cake this weekend.  I will uninstall Candy Crush.  That would really hurt me.  That's just mean.  That would really hurt on a personal level.  I'm obsessed with this stupid game.  But I will say goodbye to it.  How does that do anything for you, Ryan?  It doesn't. 
[02:01:00]  Nothing.  I can't think of anything else to do.  10?  I mean, a little matter of $1,700.  Shut up, Sam.  I'll crunch the fucking numbers.  Plus whatever is going on in that...  What if...  All right, I got a new one.  Chubby boy's mind.  No, I got a new one for real.  How about if you pay for part of his vacation?  I will pay for his entire vacation.  Whoa!  Not meals.  Not meals.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Jimmy just saved me.  Meal's not included.  I will pay for the hotel bill, including room service. 
[02:01:30]  Whoa.  That's a gamble right there.  And I will pay for the flights.  And the phone.  Wow!  He's got my word.  Holy shit!  That's righteous.  Yeah.  He's got my word.  That's righteous.  There's some kind of Operation Drop going on with the flight.  Oh, God.  You're dealing with...  What do you mean?  You're dealing with Greg Hughes right now.  I'm serious.  Wow!  As much as it's easy to make the jokes and keep going with this, I will do that for him immediately.  So you're willing to pay for three seats. 
[02:02:00]  But he's got to...  He's got to sort of accept my apology that I didn't mean to do this.  But I will do that immediately.  Conditional.  Conditional.  I think that's...  I think that's more than fair.  That's more than fair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's way more than $1,700, dickhead.  Well, you need to also do the $1,700.  Shut up.  That's just a vacation.  He's got a phone to deal with now.  Yeah, because then it'll be the vacation minus $1,700.  Let's see how much the vacation costs.  That might have been a pretty penny.  Those tickets are expensive.  Yeah.  Just the park tickets.  I didn't say park tickets.  Well... 
[02:02:30]  I didn't say park tickets.  Park tickets are pretty expensive.  What the fuck?  I said hotel, room service, and the flights.  Has he been using the FedPass?  What gets you to the front of the line?  All right, wait.  What's a fat pass?  Fast pass?  He said fast pass.  I said fast pass.  What?  That's pretty good, because you show up at a certain time, and you just get right in.  All right.  Very convenient.  I'm going to...  He's not writing me back.  What?  He's probably not looking at his phone. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, man.  Text him that.  He'll look at it.  He'll read a text.  If he sees Opie, text him.  So, text him your proposition.  And make sure you say the vacation plus $1,700 for a new phone.  Shut up.  Yeah.  If his phone's going straight to voicemail, he doesn't have it on.  He's not going to see the text.  I'll pay for it.  Mm-hmm.  Well, there's the work phone.  There's also email.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, email.  The work phone.  I emailed him last night asking for a favor.  Oh, boy.  How'd that work out for you?  Not good.  Jesus.  I need to counterbalance a piano.  All right. 
[02:03:30]  Pianos are so heavy.  They are.  It's crazy.  All right.  Here we go.  I could never lift one.  Here we go.  Why would I need that?  I know.  Why would you even need to do that?  Why would I ask a friend?  Oh, that's terrible.  Here.  You see it for yourself.  Let's see.  Okay.  All right.  Willing to pay.  I fucked up.  Okay.  Yeah.  I fucked up, which I've said many times already, but he's not writing me back.  I will pay for your entire vacation to show how sincere I am.  Check on Monday.  Oh.  Wow.  Send. 
[02:04:00]  He'll, uh.  Send.  Here's what Iraq will do.  He'll know by reading these that you're probably being very sincere.  He'll know, like, all right, something stupid happened, whatever it was.  Then he'll milk it a little bit.  He'll accept the apology, but he'll, he'll, it's almost like when you argue with your chick  and you say you're sorry.  She's like for, you're walking on eggshells for a couple of days just to be nice.  So he'll kind of milk it like that, but he'll accept it because he'll know you're  being truthful.  And then he'll forget that I made that offer and he'll be like, no, man, it's cool.  That's cool. 
[02:04:30]  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Okay.  I hope.  He's so taking that offer.  Dude, he is, he would be thrilled even though he's wealthy Nagel, you know, he's got the  Nagel fortune.  He's a lottery winner.  Right.  Things like that.  Property owner.  He's going to have to take the vacation money to buy the new phone.  That's what I'm saying.  Depends.  Well, the vacation is 500 bucks.  I mean, 5,000 bucks or whatever it is.  Jeez.  Dude.  I think you're fucking.  Yeah.  Disney.  You're, you're paying for the rooms.  You're paying for the room and you're paying for the flights. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Well, the room service took you to 5,000.  That's.  Now, if you're paying for 5,000.  I made more than that just talking about this.  I love guys that say, you know, if Bill Gates is walking, he drops $10,000.  He loses money if he stops to pick it up.  That's a good one, Chip.  People say that.  I know.  Those dummies.  Mine is 1,700.  That's still a $3,300.  All right. 
[02:05:30]  He hasn't responded to that text.  Yeah, but that's 20% of the vacation that now he has to pay to buy a phone.  It's a good point.  All right.  Could you get Sal to call him with the offer?  Yeah.  Tell this boy to call him.  Where's Sal?  Travis maybe should call him.  If he sees your number coming up, Travis.  Yeah, Travis.  He may respond better.  Oh, that's true.  Well, no, because you're like, you're the producer of the program.  I guess.  That's debatable, but okay.  No, no, no.  We should have had Tim do it.  Oh, God.  He would answer that.  He would definitely answer.  Hello.  Oh, boy.  All right.  I'm not getting response. 
[02:06:00]  From my offer.  Oh, man.  He probably has the phone off.  I'm going to call him right now.  He's got me by the balls.  I mean, it's obvious.  He really does.  He's been waiting for this day for a long time.  Oh, yeah.  He's got me by the fucking balls.  Call him.  Remember the time you left him at Giant Stadium for no reason?  Shut up, Sam.  Oh, God.  Because he had to take a bus and a train home and then show up to work the next day.  Oh, my God.  Just humiliating.  Let's start treating Iraq right now.  I don't want him to quit.  He never says no.  He never says no. 
[02:06:30]  Never.  How about we start now?  I am.  I'm saying.  Are you?  Yeah.  You just spent a whole bunch of time making fun of him.  I had to get out of my system.  After he gave out his phone number.  That's a good point.  He didn't pick up.  Even the other phone number?  Yeah, his other phone number.  He could be enjoying Honey, I Shrunk the Buffet over in Epcot.  You ever see that one?  Yeah, but why would he enjoy a shrunken buffet?  No, you said Honey, I Shrunk the Buffet means I ate a lot of this. 
[02:07:00]  Open fucking highway for Mr. Cumia.  Someone's asking, can you repeat his number?  I missed it.  Captain E-A-T.  The Haunted Manicotti.  Pirates of the Cholesterol.  This is mean.  Someone sent a text to this number with Slobo and a bunch of food icons.  Oh, Jesus.  If E-Rock is smart, he'll save all the messages and stuff. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He should.  Oh, I hope he doesn't delete them.  We could just fucking listen to all of them.  Email and tell him do not delete the messages.  You just said you wanted to treat him right.  And now, instead of treating him right, you want him to bring the voicemails where he's getting made fun of.  Well, in a way, people's numbers are attached to them, so if they called E-Rock and said horrible things, he could post that.  He can't post people's phone numbers on the air.  He's just taking lemons and making meringue. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Right?  Mars Comet.  No Park Hopper, though?  You're not paying for the Park Hopper tickets?  Pretty fucking expensive.  I wrote Entire Vacation.  Wow.  All right.  I did write Entire Vacation.  I just said, fuck it. 
[02:08:30]  That's no joke anymore.  You saw, I will pay for your entire vacation to show how sincere I am.  Check on Monday.  Poor Copper.  You know he's staying at the premium resorts, right?  Whatever.  I get it.  That's a deluxe resort he's staying at.  Yeah, he's staying at those nice resorts.  Oh, is it?  Sure, yeah.  E-Rock understands how to treat himself well.  Yeah, he does.  Animal Kingdom?  No.  How much is a Disney vacation?  He didn't want to be mistaken.  Jesus.  It's like, hey, what's one of the exhibits doing in our hallways?  He's walking around.  Back in the hippo pen.  He keeps getting darted. 
[02:09:00]  You guys are doing a bad job of treating him better.  Oh, come on.  A Chinese dentist wrote, I hope he has to pay for E-Rock's room.  Don't kill the messenger, by the way.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  How much does it cost to rent a tank at SeaWorlds?  Oh, that's the only killer whales would stay in tanks at SeaWorlds.  Yeah, yeah, come on. 
[02:09:30]  Those things are gigantic.  Oh.  Wow, he's not responding to my offer.  That's not good.  He probably didn't say, he probably got the phone off.  Do you want me to text his wife?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll text her with your offer.  But say, make sure she knows I'm sincere.  Yeah, put LOL after it.  I would think she's furious, too.  Let these guys make their jokes, but make sure she knows I'm sincere, and I really did just fuck up.  And that's my make good. 
[02:10:00]  Because money makes everything go away.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  We all like to make believe it doesn't, but.  He's going to have to, you know, look at both sides of it and go, all right, on one hand, I got fucking the vacation.  Ruined, because of the phone.  And on the other hand.  Jimmy just sees.  Jimmy's a seer.  I saw it when you said, on one hand, on the other hand, we'll have something fattening in us. 
[02:10:30]  Exactly.  Oh, it's just one insult after another.  Poor E-Rock and his dumb vacation's over.  What was in the other hand?  Oh, I don't know.  It could have been a sandwich.  That's good.  I hope he enjoys his time.  He should probably, where's he going today, Epcot? 
[02:11:00]  There's no way he's going to enjoy the rest of his time.  Spaceship Girth.  Oh.  The geodesic, you ever see it?  It's great.  Sponsored by AT&T.  It's great.  Yeah.  Oh.  Well.  That's a pretty fucking good deal.  I got to say, you stepped up.  I texted her.  You're fucking, you know, you came clean, said, all right, I fucked up. 
[02:11:30]  You're making good, like, without even letting him calm down.  Because he might just calm down and go, all right, I get you.  Right away, you're like, I'll pay for your whole vacation.  That's fucking righteous.  Throw enough money at him.  Don't pretend he doesn't resent you.  Yeah, look, you want to give my number out?  I'll take a vacation.  Wow, look at that.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I don't know how many Disney gay jokes we have, but a whole bunch.  A whole bunch.  Yeah.  Hey, what are you, down there with Goofy's pecker up your butt or something? 
[02:12:00]  That's a good one right there.  Off to a good start, Chip.  Can we go to break?  Well, hopefully we'll have an update on this after the break.  Yeah.  I doubt it.  We're definitely going to do Jacktober.  We're definitely going to talk to Dan Soder.  We're definitely going to eat tacos, so.  Uh-huh.  And maybe more of this.  Hopefully we'll have an update.  I'm going to try to make some phone calls during the break.  Yeah.  That's a bad one.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Uh.  Oh.  Um.  Jacktober, yeah.  Jacktober next.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Serious.  Next time.  Now.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. continues.  There are no report.  Oh, I can tell who's on the fucking board today.  Little Pearl Jam. 
[02:13:00]  Hey, I went the entire week without doing it.  Yes, you did.  Hey, when are we going to Pearl Jam?  I don't know.  When are we going?  I wrote her, and she was on it, but I don't have an update.  Uh-oh.  When's the show?  Coming soon, right?  Yeah, two weeks from today.  Two weeks from today.  All right, I'll write her right now, the ticket lady.  Why don't you just give her a number out?  Was she a Pearl Jam playing Yankee Stadium?  No, Barclays.  Oh, Barclay, whatever it's called. 
[02:13:30]  How does she get tickets for that?  She's just a ticket lady, man.  She could get them from many places.  She's got connections.  She knows the other ticket people.  Oh, yeah.  All right, I just wrote it for an update.  We'll see what happens, Travis.  Trying to get Travis Pearl Jam tickets, and myself some Pearl Jam tickets.  Let's get Dan Soder in here.  All right.  E-Rock's not responding whatsoever.  That's tragic.  Maybe he's still at the park.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe he's getting ready for a day of fun. 
[02:14:00]  Fun.  Mickey's Tun Town.  Huh?  It's 847.  Huh?  He's not at the park.  Oh, oh, oh.  Sometimes they open the park early.  You pay a little extra for that, right?  Yeah.  And you get to go in early, before the crowds?  Yeah.  Hi, Dan.  Hey, guys.  There he is.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Terrific.  We got ourselves into a situation.  Yeah, folks.  What's his wee shit?  Yeah, because then he's not going to remember all the fucking jokes. 
[02:14:30]  What?  I didn't say something like, you know, the Tower of Tiramisu.  This is the day E-Rock, this is the day E-Rock became a supervillain.  Yeah.  You're all on his list now.  No, yeah.  Even though it's not your, Anthony or Jim's fault.  No, it'll just be.  No, that's the problem.  I'm on his list.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then they knew that.  They knew they had, especially this one over here, knew he had an open highway with no  fucking troopers, so he took advantage.  Hey, there you go.  Because in the end, E-Rock's not going to remember any of that shit.  He's just going to remember that I mistakenly gave his number out on the fucking show. 
[02:15:00]  The guy that gave out the fucking number.  Oh, man.  You just destroyed his cell phone.  Yeah.  Which is just, in this day and age, it could be one of the worst things you could do.  It could be the worst thing you could do.  That number is your connection to everybody, and when you have to change it, oh, my God.  It's just going to be a painstaking.  Brutal.  Kenny outside was like, would you rather have this happen or have him fuck your wife?  And you're like, wife? 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  And you're like, wife?  Because at least you can be like, all right, I get to go now.  She's easier to replace than all those fucking contacts.  Just one wife, 10,000 numbers.  Woo, Eric.  We haven't seen you in a while, Dan.  I like you a lot, brother.  Yeah, it's nice to be back.  You're playing the Stress Factory this weekend, right?  Yeah, all this weekend.  Yeah.  It's going to be fun.  My first time there.  7-3-2-5-4-5-4-2-4-2.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:16:00]  Ha, ha.  Oh, wow.  A little number.  14.  Whoa.  I was ready to dump out.  Wow.  Yeah, you guys are going to be skittish about phone numbers for the rest of the time.  Did you do it last night?  Yeah, the shit out of us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was fun.  It was a good crowd.  Yeah, they were nice.  There was a group of people that did, you know when they do like corporate events and then  some of the people stay for the comedy show and they're just a little too drunk?  Oh, yeah.  There were some of those people, but I got them to leave.  Wait, they have an early corporate event before you?  Yeah.  So what does that entail?  Other comics? 
[02:16:30]  I don't know, but I just showed up and there were like people, and they were from, it was  the funniest company, it was from the Sunglass Hut, so it was just easy to make fun of them  because of like, oh, highfalutin' sunglass people?  Mm-hmm.  I used to believe in the Sunglass Hut.  Yeah, the nice.  They had so much these days.  It was the nicest kiosk in the mall most of the time.  You know what you should have said?  What are you guys all hoping it's sunny or something?  Chip, that is gold.  Fuck yeah, they would have fucking cracked up.  That's great stuff.  I'm telling you, ever since Chipper got on Twitter, it's been a... 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you follow Chip?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, you have to.  The second I found out, he was on Twitter.  I was so humiliated when I sent...  Yeah, I sent out an Edgar tweet this morning.  I was so humiliated when I sent out a Chip tweet under my own name.  Now I go, oh, it's fucking terrible.  Embarrassing.  I got to some peripheral people and no one...  No one's writing me back.  No one's writing you back, huh?  I understand the seriousness of this, and I understand how he's extremely pissed, but... 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  At least let me explain.  I just imagine he's sitting in a darkened hotel room smoking cigarettes.  Just fucking pissed.  Thinking of revenge.  Pissed as hell.  Yeah.  That's it.  So, sweetie, what do you want to do?  Nothing.  Should we do the Magic Kingdom today, or should we do Epcot?  Nothing.  I don't want to leave the hotel room.  Do they sell rifles here?  Yeah.  You go.  I don't care.  I want to go to the swamp and think.  Oh, God. 
[02:18:00]  He's just mad.  Yeah.  It's the happiest place on earth, except for that room.  That's it.  Fuck it.  He's just mad.  That feeling when you land in a city and turn on your phone, and the annoyance of even  four texts coming through, that has to be amplified.  It's probably just...  Constant.  You have to smash it with a hammer.  Yeah.  It drives me insane.  Yeah.  He's going to be very upset.  Because you either got to shut it off, which is bad, because then you're cut off.  Yeah.  Or you leave it on, and even if you shut the sound off, it's just constantly... 
[02:18:30]  No, I leave nothing.  You can't...  Nothing?  I have to pick it up and look for it.  Yeah, but then you don't know.  Exactly.  I have to give somebody...  Oh, poor Iraq.  He is in quite the situation right now.  Oh, man.  He's going to have a drink and eat his way through Epcot, from fucking Canada to Mexico.  It's all over, Johnny.  Everywhere in between.  I don't even know what you could eat in Morocco, but he'll find something.  He's going to do the whole...  Yeah.  He's going to get it all in.  Oh, God. 
[02:19:00]  Anyway, Dan, how are you?  You know what?  I'm great, actually.  Because this is like one of those things by comparison where you're like...  Right, right.  So I think it could be worse.  Yeah, I woke up with like a little bit of a sore throat, and then I heard what happened  at E-Rock, and I'm like, I'm doing great.  You know?  The sun's shining.  Comparable.  Yeah, compared to E-Rock.  Oh, boy.  Everyone's in a great place.  Where are you at with football?  You good?  Yeah.  You know, Niners are 2-2.  I know.  Yeah.  What's going on over there?  I don't know.  They're not running the ball as much.  A lot of injuries on defense. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  But, yeah.  It was...  I got to actually do a web series with Al Madrigal and Tommy Johnigan for the 49ers, which  was like the greatest.  Jeez.  They know who you are now.  Good to see you.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Free stuff.  I ask because he's a huge Niners fan, obviously, Dan.  Diehard Niner fan.  Diehard.  Yeah.  They flew us out to San Francisco, got to go to the facility, but it was the day after  they lost to the Seahawks.  So, that's like a tough thing because you're happy to be there, but no one else is.  So, you're just like, hey, guys, huh?  49ers.  Like, yeah, we lost. 
[02:20:00]  Let's have fun.  Yeah.  No.  Everyone's got an E-Rock look on their face.  Yeah.  It's a very E-Rock vibe.  Hungry.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Seattle looking pretty good this year.  Yeah.  I wonder if it's one of those things where they're just going to be the best team all  regular season and hopefully lose in the playoffs.  The fall part of the playoffs.  That's what I'm hoping for.  Just because the Seattle fans now are getting arrogant to the point of annoyance.  That 12th man, you stole that from Texas A&M. 
[02:20:30]  And they're like, we're the 12th man.  A college was doing that.  Doesn't every team have the 12th man thing?  Yeah.  It's pretty much it.  Buffalo certainly had it when I was up there.  It's like the terrible towel.  Everyone steals it and then calls it their own.  Right.  And then when it's successful, they act like it's theirs.  I hate fucking stadium props.  Oh, I hate them.  Stadium props.  We're number one.  Our team's number one.  They're spinning towels.  They got the fucking rally monkeys.  Oh, that was the worst.  The outbreak monkey.  Oh, the rally monkey. 
[02:21:00]  Fucking assholes.  And the thunder fucking sticks.  They smack them together.  Those are the only things I don't like.  What?  The thunder sticks.  You don't like the thunder fucking...  Tell the shit I don't care.  The rally hats.  It's rallying.  You just look like a retard.  Yeah.  Certainly do.  I don't want to say that.  There's stadium culture that is just annoying.  Yeah.  I can't stand that shit.  I like drunks stomping at the same time.  That's fun.  Yeah, that's always good.  Stomping and clapping at the same time.  Until a mezzanine falls.  Yeah, so someone fucking falls down. 
[02:21:30]  I like a good...  Like that fucking...  What was that?  That in England when that stadium caught on fire?  It's good old school fucking hooligans burning.  Yeah, it's not as bad as like...  Yeah, when they have the hooligans fenced off.  Yeah, they fence them off.  Like refugees.  Oh, it's great.  Barbed wire on top.  Yeah.  That's a little too much.  They don't want anyone intruding on the pitch.  Fuck you.  On the pitch.  Yeah.  Rally.  You don't like the rally hat?  Come on, spin your hat around.  Rally hat.  Turn it upside down and inside out. 
[02:22:00]  Inside out.  Inside out, right.  The Yankees aren't going to win unless you put your hat inside out.  Come on.  I hate those motherfuckers like when it's two out and two strikes.  They're like, come on, get up.  Get up.  Fuck you.  It's like 30 years ago that happened.  Yeah, one time it happened.  Yeah.  Stop.  I'm sitting.  I have two beers in my lap.  Yeah.  Can't be standing up.  And 40 in your stomach.  I like a beer or two at the ball game.  40.  It's a lot of beer, Jimmy. 
[02:22:30]  Fuck yeah.  Oh, fuck, sucker.  Chippa likes getting zooted at the game.  Zooted.  Zooted isn't something I've heard in a while.  Chippa uses it all the time.  Fuck yeah.  Fucking zooted.  Yeah.  When people would smoke weed with people and they'd say that, I'd be like, what?  Yeah.  You want to get zooted?  No, I want to get high.  Yeah.  Fucking zooted.  Stop coming up with trying to have clever names for getting fucked up.  I heard that name.  It's in eighth grade anymore.  It's always going to end the same way.  On the bathroom floor, vomiting.  No matter what you call it.  I'll black out by any other name. 
[02:23:00]  Adults call it a blackout.  Yes.  I got an update.  Oh, nice.  We're still in the furious stage.  That's your update.  Is he?  He's still mad?  Yes.  He's red.  He's at it.  Oh, my God.  And I don't blame him.  Does he know about the vacation offer?  There's no other way to play.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm going to just pay for his vacation.  Does he know that, though?  Because there has to be some kind of consequences.  There has to be.  I feel like an idiot.  Consequences schmance.  Let's let these guys make the fucking jokes.  I feel like a fucking douchebag. 
[02:23:30]  It's a tough thing because it really, it's a mistake.  It really, I mean.  But that's going to be true.  You guys will at least say that, right?  You know it was a mistake.  Well, Lydia called up.  And according to Lydia.  Did you ask if he was on any rides?  Yeah.  Is he in fantasy land?  You ever been to the Peter Pancakes adventure?  The what?  Now you're shoehorning.  Peter Pan's adventure.  Oh, no, I haven't.  Yeah.  But Opie, this is a mistake that is going to be treated as a war crime. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, I know.  You realize that.  Gumbo ride.  Welcome down to the Creole gumbo ride.  Just, I just imagine some annoying song playing while E-Rock's phone just keeps shaking in his pocket.  And he's just really pissed with real joyous, fun Disney music.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking fun.  Fucking sucks. 
[02:24:30]  How are you going to ride, buddy?  Let me, let me try one.  Labo!  Fucking assholes.  Just punching out those little puppets dressed as Mexicans.  I just feel bad for, he's probably going to be giving little elbow shots to little kids walking by.  Oh, yeah, he's not going to be happy.  You know what's fucked up about this?  This is the second vacation we've ruined. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  And we were purposely leaving him alone.  We were leaving him alone.  The first was not just a vacation.  We called on his first day as a goof, like, hey, we want to see, you know, thinking, but  he was smart enough to make you go write the voicemail.  He knew we were on to him.  He knew we, uh, whatever.  Well, this shows that you'd never make the mistake of leaving your voicemail blank with  just the number.  Wait, how do you know he's still furious, by the way?  You didn't tell us how you know.  Oh, that's right.  What did he write?  Fuck you?  He didn't write back.  No, no.  I'm getting from other sources. 
[02:25:30]  From other sources.  I'll just say that.  Yeah, the guy that plays Mickey.  We're in the furious stage.  He's got his hat off, like, the guy is mad still.  What'd they say?  Just furious.  Do you think he's, um...  Just says furious.  Do you think he's on one of those rides?  Stop shoehorning.  You know the submarine ones?  What's that, 20,000 pounds under the sea?  We're not even talking about that.  I can't wait for the first cell phone announcement that they make on a ride.  Please turn your cell phones off.  Oh, God.  He's going to become fucking furious.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Please silence your cell phone.  Sir, silence your cell phone, sir.  Please.  We can hear it on vibrate.  Oh, it's just constantly going off.  So, he, um...  So, someone just wrote the word, one word, furious?  Mm-hmm.  Not him, though.  Wow.  It's...  I wonder if it's...  He's going to become like Phantom of the Opera and just haunt you guys for the rest of  you.  Oh, yeah.  Haunt us under the console.  I need another one of those people. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, God.  I got plenty of those.  Not E-Rock, too.  What did I...  What happened to me?  He gave out my damn number.  He's going to be like...  That's just mean.  He's just sitting in a shitty Irish bar, just a pub drinking.  What happened?  Not even a real one.  He's like in the...  He's like in the England, Ireland at Epcot.  Fucking having a Guinness.  Sir, would you like another...  There's only one Guinness per person.  Hi.  Hi, I'm Tiffany.  Excuse me, cast member.  Could you serve me another... 
[02:27:00]  Another drink?  You don't have hard liquor here, sir.  I'm not a bartender.  I'm a cast member.  You're a guest.  My name is Tiffany O'Shea.  I'll be playing the role of an Irish lady.  Oh, God.  Didn't I see you at fucking...  In Sweden yesterday?  Yeah.  Weren't you running that fucking Maelstrom ride from...  The Swedish meatball ride?  Warren, I saw you serving the margaritas in fucking...  In Aztec uniform.  Yeah, and that's a place that you can get turned off quickly. 
[02:27:30]  Like, go to angry.  And this is...  You have to be happy at Disney.  You have to.  Yeah.  If you're walking around, it might annoy you if you're not in a good, happy mood.  And everybody's just, you know, with that music.  Bling, ding, ding.  Yeah.  Not a care in the world.  My, oh my, what the fuck do I weigh?  I feel sunshine coming my way.  I'm just...  Zippity-doo-dah, what do I weigh?  I really hope there's that one Disney employee that, like, walks by E-Rock and is like, come 
[02:28:00]  on, give me a smile.  What's wrong?  They try to do that, like, fake.  What's wrong, sir?  Yeah.  It can't be that bad.  Would you like to take a picture?  Here I am.  Cinderella.  Fucking...  Deck Cinderella.  As he's just...  What's that sound, sir?  He's going to have phantom leg vibrations for the rest of his life.  Oh my God.  He's going to get PTSD from this.  I'm so glad we're dropping it. 
[02:28:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm just amazed by it.  So am I.  Believe it or not, so am I.  This is just one of those things where you're like...  This is like when Voss gave out his password by mistake.  Oh God, right?  But you did it to somebody else.  Yeah, he gave out his password on the air.  Oh.  Oh no.  I say we do Jocktober.  Let's do Jocktober.  Dan, have you ever sat through a Jocktober with us?  I've heard it, but I've never sat through it with you guys, and I am very excited.  Are you sure?  Because it does affect you guys on the road.  So if you want to tap out, you can. 
[02:29:00]  No.  Because what happens, some of our comic friends go into some of these radio stations not knowing  that we beat the shit out of that radio show.  Yeah, but then I think that'd be more...  That's just fun to try to...  Oh, Fury.  Bless you.  Jocktober.  All right, well, if we get any Eric updates, we'll certainly pass them along, but so far  all I'm getting is furious, so we're in the furious stage, which could last maybe forever.  I'm just hoping one of the texts just says, I'm coming.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm coming for you. 
[02:29:30]  Very angry.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, a little Jocktober, ladies and gentlemen.  It's Jocktober.  Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-M-T.  Hosts.  Holes.  Bits.  And stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober. 
[02:30:00]  I got a tree on my house.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And remember, we said we want to change it up a little bit this year, make it a little  different.  Yeah.  We have decided that this particular show needs way more than one day.  Of course.  Way more than one day.  Yes.  So for this year's Jocktober, Fridays are dedicated to Scott and Todd.  Scott and Todd morning show. 
[02:30:30]  Friday is Scott and Todd day.  I got a tree on my house.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Scott and Todd.  Scott and Todd.  They've been a staple in New York City radio for many, many years.  Uh-huh.  I personally don't understand why.  But for some reason, they have enough of an audience that they continue to fucking broadcast.  Amazing.  Just looking at their picture, they have WNBA coach faces.  Yeah.  They look like they're like, ladies, hustle it up.  Come on, girls.  Come on, girls.  Come on, girls.  Hustle it up.  Another layup. 
[02:31:00]  Scott and Todd.  Scott Shannon should be a reminder that you should not.  What happened there?  Oh.  Is it possible?  What happened to the Facebook page?  What a fucking drag.  Pre-empt?  Pre-emptive.  It's possible.  What did they know?  We had a pre-emptive strike here.  I bet E-Rock tipped him off.  He's working for Scott and Todd.  Yeah.  He's like, hey, by the way, fuck them guys.  They're going to fuck you today.  It was all dirt.  Shut down your Facebook.  I think we kind of, I think we talked about Friday's being Scott and Todd day before today. 
[02:31:30]  So I think they're on to us.  No, here you go.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Hey, there we go.  Scott and Todd from PLJ here in New York City.  PLJ's Facebook page?  Scott Shannon, in all fairness, did a lot of cool things for radio.  But he probably should have stepped out a few years ago.  Oh, boy.  He's overstated as well.  Yeah.  It's a reminder that maybe there's a time for all of us to just step aside.  Is it that he's just trying too hard now?  No, he's not trying at all. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, at all.  He has a rock mouth.  That's fair enough.  He looks like a fucking rock and he sounds like one.  He's saying he's a rock-headed idiot?  He's a rock-headed idiot.  He has Easter Island head.  Those fucking monoliths.  And I don't know.  It looks like he's had some work done over the years to the point he might have fucked up his own.  He went to the well too many times?  I think so, yes.  Most of his face doesn't move.  There's nothing better than a guy with too much facial plastic surgery. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  And he really doesn't say much on the radio anymore of importance.  Oh, man.  No.  He looks like...  And then his partner frosts his hair.  Honked out of stone.  A lot.  Yeah, yeah.  He looks like a senator that tried to kill Steven Seagal or like set up Steven Seagal.  You know what I mean?  He's just like, I know you're a good cop, but I don't care.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, he could have a rolling machete.  Yeah.  What do we got from Scott and Todd? 
[02:33:00]  Well, I figure there are a couple staples.  I hope he's checking his phone.  Update?  No update.  Oh, boy.  So we're going to stick with Still Furious.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Now, he actually mellowed out, actually, took a log flume ride.  Oh, yeah.  He's like, you know what, guys?  After I got splashed on Splash Mountain, I realized it's not that big of a deal.  It's not that bad anymore.  It's having fun.  Yeah.  I'm going to go get a Bing phone.  Happiest place on earth.  Yeah.  I got a text from Eric. 
[02:33:30]  What does it say?  I'm not mad.  Oh, great.  April Files.  Oh, Edgar.  April Files.  Don't even.  No timing.  Oh, God.  Doesn't even wait for it to.  Fucking terrible.  Settle in.  It's not April.  All right.  So it's Scott and Todd Day.  Yeah.  Early Friday, we're doing Scott and Todd Fuck It for Jocktober this year.  And today, we start with a fine song parody.  They love.  Oh, do they love their song parodies?  They love the song parody.  They love a good parody.  But if you notice, one thing I love about their song parodies is how they shoehorn words in 
[02:34:00]  by just completely putting the accent on the wrong syllable.  They put words in that are much more wordy than the original song.  They have to bend and twist the line.  I mean, like a good parody, the words naturally fit in and you sing it and it sounds like  the original song.  They're incapable of doing those.  Yeah.  So they really try for their song parodies.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  I mean, the energy's there, sir.  Oh, God. 
[02:34:30]  What is this one about?  Is it topical?  Not really.  I mean, the great thing about Scott and Todd.  Yeah.  It doesn't have to be topical.  We've been doing Jocktober for six years, I think.  Wow.  This is the sixth or seventh year.  It's the exact same show.  Yeah.  I mean, for all these years that I've been listening to them, their show hasn't changed even  slightly.  Wow.  So the song parody is still indeed a staple.  Yeah.  No, I think this one, sometimes they'll do a topical one, but since the show hasn't changed  in so long, sometimes I think they can also go back into the archives and pull one out. 
[02:35:00]  Evergreens.  Anything?  No.  You think he's on a ride?  We're not talking about rides right now.  Why is it Disney?  I thought maybe he was on the Mad Hatter spinning D-cups.  No?  Just getting nauseous while his phone's vibrating.  Oh, yeah.  Did you say teacups or?  Oh, yeah.  That's what I said.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Of course.  What else would I have said?  I don't know.  Uh-huh.  Oh, God. 
[02:35:30]  Getting ready to laugh.  What's in that taco meat?  Yeah.  Is it full of little chihuahua feet?  Yeah.  Burritos made from rodents in the street?  Yeah.  Do they just slap some sauce on it and heat?  Yeah.  Take it to the fridge.  Oh, my God.  Uh-huh.  Chalupas are such a delicious snack.  Uh-huh.  I like to buy and eat them by the sack.  Uh-huh. 
[02:36:00]  But when their meat's alive, does it say quack?  Uh-huh.  Yucks.  Take it to the chorus.  Is it Pete or Armand Gallow?  Is it Pete?  Hey, Jen, or Black Crow?  Is it Pete or Black Crow?  Is it Pete or Black Crow?  Terrible.  This is fucking hilarious.  I can't even fucking deal.  Yep.  This is on New York radio.  They think that's going to be-  The number one market in the country.  Asshole that's like, this is good.  This is good.  I got a parody about taco meat.  You guys are not going to believe the new one.  It is taco meat parody.  Fantastic.  You know how they were talking about, like, what's in that taco meat? 
[02:36:30]  No.  Didn't hear that.  Well, I read the story.  No one else knows it.  So let's make a song about it.  Obscure news stories turned into parody songs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you guys hear about the traffic on the upper level of the Queensborough Bridge?  We did a parody song about it.  A car broke down.  And I'm now trying to get around.  Fucking stretching for a frown.  Anything.  Oh, my God.  Take it to the bridge.  Because they say that in the song. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because they really do say that in the song.  Flat and drastic.  Is it Pete from Argentina?  Is it Pete?  Or kangaroo skins?  Is it Pete?  Or is it penguins?  Is it Pete?  Or wild wombat?  Is it Pete?  Or rabbit bobcats?  What's in that taco meat?  Yeah.  Is it full of little chihuahua feet?  Yeah.  Oh, they're reputed.  Same.  Same fucking line.  Do they just slap some sauce on it and he? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Take it to the bridge.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Uh-huh.  Chalupas are such a delicious snack.  They're doing the same thing.  That's how lazy this is.  Right.  They're doing just the shitty verse again.  Fucking funny.  You like it, Chip?  It's clean yoga.  It's clean.  Is it Pete?  Or sliced hyena?  Is it Pete?  From Argentina?  Is it Pete?  Or kangaroos?  Are there hyenas in Argentina? 
[02:38:00]  I don't think so.  Is it Pete?  Or wild wombat?  Is it Pete?  Or rabbit bobcats?  Oh.  Fucking good stuff.  I love it.  Good stuff.  Wow.  Fun song.  Fun song.  Fuck yeah.  Perfect example again of Jocktober.  Song parodies, 99.9% of them suck ass.  They are terrible.  What upsets me the most is thinking of the person that enjoys this.  Well, there was a time they were, you know, maybe not on that show, I don't know, but in 
[02:38:30]  general, you know, you'd appreciate a good song parody.  Hey, I used to write a few myself.  I think that time has passed us a long time ago.  Scott and Todd being featured on Jocktober today.  Look at his frosted hair.  Is Todd...  He enjoys a good frosting.  Is Todd gay?  Not that I know of.  Oh, okay.  I'm just wondering.  He just plays one in his pictures.  He looks like a gay man.  Which is fine.  Right.  It's not that there's anything wrong with that.  Hi, I'm just selling some real estate in Vermont. 
[02:39:00]  Yes, the frosted hair, the turtleneck sweater.  He likes to perform.  He loves doing...  With that horrible...  What is that?  The burgundy color?  Yeah.  I just have to curl up with some chamomile.  I use an exfulgating wash.  Hi, guys.  Welcome back to the program.  Burgundy's a rough color for fucking anyone.  Oh, is he trying to be a hipster with those glasses?  Well, you know what?  Ah, wah, wah, wah.  You make fun.  That's the look.  Ah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, we don't...  When was the last time we wore a suit to work?  These guys wear suits to work. 
[02:39:30]  Ugh.  Anyway, we move on with some classic Scott and Todd banter as the boys talk about Carrie  Underwood singing the Beatles.  And Scott contributes...  Oh.  Nothing.  Oh.  Damn, I thought he contributed something.  I thought he was going to step in.  Oh, man.  There's a theme with today's Jocktober.  Uh-huh.  You're going to hear a theme.  I think we picked up on it.  Okay.  It was sort of shaky, and then some people said stuff like, uh, I'll never forget where  I was when JFK was shot, and I'll never forget where I was when Carrie Underwood murdered 
[02:40:00]  the Beatles.  She got the most tweets.  17,090 during the show.  Elton John was second with 13,720.  Is this a fun show?  Those were a lot of hate tweets, though.  That's all right.  Doesn't matter.  I guess.  I didn't think it was that terrible.  No, I didn't either.  I mean, she's a nice lady.  That's not an easy song, this thing.  Who gives a shit if she's a nice lady?  I don't like that.  It's a classic, and I guess a lot of the, you know, the guys or girls on Twitter might  be-  Well, they probably never even heard it.  Right.  You know? 
[02:40:30]  Like, who did this?  One Direction?  Who's this?  Who's this one of them One Direction songs?  I hate One Direction.  I hate One Direction.  Wow.  It's good stuff.  It's good stuff.  Him and Todd quite obviously hate each other.  There's no chemistry there whatsoever.  Because Todd just plows over him.  Yeah.  He doesn't listen to him.  Right.  She seems like a nice lady.  A nice lady.  Thank you, nice lady.  Nice ass.  I think a lot of it is Scott trying to tag everything Todd does. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  With nothing.  With nothing, yes.  He tags with nothing.  With stony silence.  Or the last thing where he's going like, he's doing this One Direction bit, and then Scott  for no reason goes, I hate One Direction.  I hate One Direction.  You didn't say it right.  I hate One Direction.  It bothers me because it's me.  Yeah, I agree wholeheartedly.  I hate them.  Gays are getting married.  I just blurt anything out. 
[02:41:30]  I don't like my daughter's dating a black guy.  Mare.  Mare.  I don't like One Direction.  One Direction.  Mare.  Oh, he's great.  What does he hate One Direction for?  I don't like One Direction.  He just blurted it out.  I hate them.  They woke him up from a nap.  Yeah.  One Direction.  I hear more coherent stuff walking by an old age home here in New York City.  That's what we're listening to.  Exactly.  We got someone who wants to comment on the taco meat song. 
[02:42:00]  Don't forget, it's taco day on the Opie and Anthony show.  You bet it is.  Get ready to enjoy us eating tacos.  Brian from Impractical Jokers.  Hey, guys.  They call me Q on Impractical Jokers.  Yeah.  What are you guys doing?  I actually like the show, and I heard you were a fan of ours, which I think is pretty cool, man.  What do you got, Brian?  I'm a huge fan, man.  I just got satellite.  I just bought a new car, and I just got satellite radio in it.  I was so excited to listen to you guys.  And I didn't get, like, I turned it on, and it was like a glorious moment. 
[02:42:30]  I was like, I'm back.  This is great.  And I didn't know you guys were doing a joke.  I just heard you guys say, get ready to laugh, and then play the taco meat song.  Oh, no.  You thought that was us?  I was like, what have you been while I've been gone?  What's been going on?  Oh, no.  I just imagined Opie with a bunch of plastic surgery on his face.  Yeah.  What direction?  That's a funny taco meat song.  Man, it's great.  She's a nice lady. 
[02:43:00]  She's a nice lady.  Wasn't that bad?  You get Carrie Underwood, who's like a young, good-looking girl.  Yeah, yeah.  And your description of her, she's a nice lady.  She's a foxy lady.  That's not strong.  I mean, just states facts.  She's like, that's not strong.  Man.  Thank you, worthless.  Hey, Brian, you've got to come in and do our show, man.  I would love to.  You tell me how and when, and I'm there.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  My in-laws turned me on to Impractical Jokers.  You've got them to thank.  And I absolutely like it. 
[02:43:30]  Where are we at with the show?  I don't even know.  I'm a little behind.  We're on a new episode start the 24th of October, and we are shooting the third season now.  So we're just going to go.  We've got like 30 more episodes to shoot.  All right.  I'm thinking guest spot for myself.  I'm thinking the same thing, but I'm right in.  Just put him on the spot.  Yeah.  I'm thinking guest spot.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Sounds like you're building new friendships.  I can pull a joke or two every once in a while. 
[02:44:00]  Let me tell you, I can make that happen.  I have that power.  I would love to be on that show, all kidding aside.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We're going to get your number, because you should absolutely come in to promote the new season.  I live on Stam Island, man.  I can be there every day in a week.  Well.  We've got to get back to Joktober, so hold on the line.  Thank you, Brian.  He's a nice lady.  All right.  We're featuring Scott and Todd, which we're going to do every fucking Friday for the month 
[02:44:30]  of Joktober.  Well, we got Scott here getting topical.  Oh, that's always good.  He's good.  I mean, you guys are making fun of him for saying he hates One Direction, but he knows  what's going on.  All right.  He gets it.  He gets it.  He's probably on the Twitter.  Oh, yeah, he is.  Oh, nice.  Listen to him getting topical.  I like the Google.  My friends.  I use CompuServe.  DOS prop.  Anyone got a new AOL disc? 
[02:45:00]  I like playing the Tetris.  That's what I play.  It soothes my brain.  We got any faxes?  I'm coming in.  Fax paper.  Where's the afternoon paper?  I'm coming out.  I want to read the dailies.  James Cromwell.  Cromwell, thank you.  Cromwell, you've been around forever.  He was in a movie.  Remember that movie?  He's been in a hundred movies.  Remember that movie he was in about?  Babe, Pig in the City?  Yeah, the pig.  The pig movie. 
[02:45:30]  Didn't you see that?  I don't think that you want to bring that up on a day you just won an Emmy.  Oh, my God.  Is Scott okay?  Is Scott okay?  I don't think so.  I think this is not...  I think he was in that movie.  The pig movie.  Yeah, when he came out his number on the radio.  His vacation was ruined.  Everyone's calling his home.  They're probably calling his house.  You're like, no, it's his cell phone.  Babe, Pig at Disney.  The name of the movie. 
[02:46:00]  But they all quickly try to finish his fucking sentence so they can move on.  They close him, they shut him down.  They try to shut him down.  Hey, pig!  Wait, he was in that movie.  He was in a thousand movies.  Shut up, you doddering old fool.  Hey, we did a lot of them, you stroke-fake, rock-headed nothing.  Shut up!  He really is.  He's like the last years of Strom Thurmond, where they keep trying to cut him off before  he says anything.  Cut him off.  Don't say something stupid.  They should hire the angel of death to just be in the studio to keep him quiet.  Just sitting there looking at him, waving his finger. 
[02:46:30]  No, no, shut up.  The angel of death with a-  To bring the sickle?  Yeah, yeah.  Sickle at him.  The angel of death with a pillow just ready to go.  It's the pig movie.  The pig movie.  What was that one?  You know who doesn't eat pigs are those Muslims?  That'd be cool if he just didn't even know.  He just loses his mind.  Yeah, the Jews ought to fire pigs over the wall at them muzzies.  That's the real fight. 
[02:47:00]  That's it.  Don't get me started on the coloreds.  Nigger.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Sog, Barry.  Sog, Barry.  Ah.  The Jew.  There's a spook on my block.  I don't like these China men yelling at me.  They're trying to drive with chinks on the road.  It's impossible, those bastards.  Ah, they get in a cab and the guy just smells like curry.  Ah, well.  Fair, fair, fair. 
[02:47:30]  What direction?  Oh, boy.  I'm going to love Fridays.  Got around here.  Nice lady, though.  I like that nice lady from the pig movie.  Pig movie.  Touch her face.  Did he say nice lady?  Yeah.  I did.  Carrie Underwood.  Carrie Underwood.  This nice lady.  This is a nice lady.  She's saying a song.  That's great.  All right, guys.  So.  What else?  I love this.  Well, you got Todd.  Mm-hmm.  The one that likes a good frosting.  Oh.  Yeah.  He's telling a DMV story. 
[02:48:00]  Boy, that's topical.  Okay.  People can relate.  Very relatable.  And he puts Scott, I like how Sam wrote this out, and his comments on the Pay No Mind list.  Oh, no.  He won't let him talk.  Fuck no.  He knows.  And never feeds him anything to get his opinion and tries to shut him down.  Wait till you.  Scott jumps in a couple times.  Oh, God.  And Todd places him directly on the Pay No Mind list.  Directly.  I love it. 
[02:48:30]  Not subtle at all, huh?  No.  I mean, a one-way ticket to the Pay No Mind list.  You know, sometimes when we do Jacktober, I see the track list, and I go, oh, fuck.  We got to do four more.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm feeling sad here that we don't have like twice as many clips today.  That's why we celebrate every Friday.  I love it.  I am so sad.  This relationship between Todd and Scott really is just making me, this is great.  It's magic.  It's like a son who hates his father, but his father won't die.  Yes. 
[02:49:00]  It's just like, yeah, Dad, we know it.  Okay.  Right.  You're embarrassing me.  They've been together forever, because my friend, and he is my friend in the end, Jim  Chandler.  Yeah, but he rocks your friend, too.  Oh, boy.  And look what you did to him.  Jim Chandler worked.  Friends like him.  Who needs enemies, right?  Oh, yeah.  Chip up.  Good one, Chip.  Got Chip all around.  Jim Chandler worked with Todd up in Albany at the Fly, and they were doing very well together.  And Todd decided to take the big gig in New York with Scott. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, because that frosting ain't going to pay for itself.  No.  That's right.  You got to get that frost money.  I wish we could fucking put like little frost pellets in a shotgun.  Can you see me use that?  It's a new applicator.  Yeah.  You frost it from the inside of the throat.  Fucking die.  Fuck.  Yeah.  It makes me very happy that Todd is now stuck with this rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's hear.  I got to hear this.  I love it.  Well, I'm slowing down because like I finally want to have a good meal.  You don't want to fucking.  Yes.  I found out what it is. 
[02:50:00]  I found out Scott and Todd's relationship is Todd is the gold digging wife that married  the old rich man.  And now the old rich man won't die.  It's Anna Nicole and her old husband.  Not dying.  Give me a kiss.  Kiss me on the lips.  And turn that off.  I hate One Direction.  I don't like it.  Yeah, goddamn kids.  Well, that episode of Twilight Zone with the old guy and his fucking niece, Barbara.  Yeah.  Barbara, bring me some hot cocoa in my bone cup, Barbara. 
[02:50:30]  We got a guy that used to drive Scott and Todd to the airport.  See, I'm stalling because we only have a few clips left around.  Oh, cool.  You're right.  Perse operator.  You're on the line.  He used to intern at PLJ.  So go ahead, Bill.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  I want to quickly say that we have no idea what you're saying is real.  Oh, it's absolutely real.  I used to intern at WPLJ, and they would have me bring Scott and Todd to the airport.  And one at a time, two at a time, but they would sit in the back seat like I was a fucking chauffeur.  And I'm like, hey, guys, it's a fucking 95 Astrovan. 
[02:51:00]  You know, I don't have a hat up here, you know?  That's your whole story?  Fascinating.  Yeah, you just made me like Scott and Todd.  Fascinating.  Well, maybe they're the, I mean, to defend them, maybe they were in the back seat to  just talk about some shit.  Or, yeah, or he's trying to poison Scott.  Right.  Use an intern, guys.  I'm a friendly guy.  Shut up, you fucking take Jessica Tandy to the Piggly Wiggly.  Quiet.  It's not a treat to be in the back seat.  I take the front seat every fucking time. 
[02:51:30]  That's the seat to be in.  Yeah.  Well.  I like the back.  I like that it's an Astrovan.  Yeah.  All right, Bill.  Great story.  That was the best part of the story.  Exactly.  I was going to be saying it was an Astrovan.  All right, let's get back to this.  DMV story and Scott and his comments are put on the Pay No Mind list.  I had quite a day yesterday.  Really?  Yeah.  I had to go to DMV.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And the lady who usually helped me over there retired.  So guess what is on my own? 
[02:52:00]  Oh, no.  You had to go in there like a regular New Jerseyan?  I don't know.  The people I saw in there, I never saw in New Jersey.  I felt like somebody should have been playing a steel drum offering me a little plastic cup of punch.  So basically, you were riding in steerage?  How long was your day there?  Wow.  What does that mean?  About an hour and 45.  Nothing.  Riding in steerage?  Steerage?  Is that a plane?  They hate minorities.  Oh, they certainly do. 
[02:52:30]  You can tell from their brakes.  You know what happened?  They fired a jigger bull who used to help you?  All right, keep me in steerage.  I'd probably put her out in the field.  What happened to the woman that used to help you?  She was a nice lady.  She used to make fun of Scott's voice, but what about Todd's voice in that cadence?  What's he doing?  I have a clip.  Yeah.  I'm saving it for next Friday.  Wow.  Is that good? 
[02:53:00]  Let's do it today.  Fuck it.  There'll be plenty next Friday.  What are you doing?  I have a clip of Todd going from a radio cadence voice, that weird thing that he does, into live  read.  Yeah.  It's like a different person.  I know.  Why does he do that?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  Can we get that?  Yeah.  We'll play it today, because there'll be plenty for next Friday, Scott and Todd.  Yeah, and I don't want to be teased.  I got to hear this.  Yeah, Dan's like you're running next week.  All the Scott and Todd I get is right now.  It's right now.  Got to blow the load. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Give us it all.  Fill my belly with this nonsense.  Sure.  What else is going on with you, Dan, as Sam runs down the hall?  I've just been on the road, which is nice.  Yeah.  You know, get out there and really...  You're blowing up, man.  I was on YouTube the other day, and some of your clips are like, got hundreds of thousands  of views.  That's pretty cool when that happens for you guys.  The Conan clip got a lot of views because of my Russian joke, like a lot of Russian people.  Right.  And I was like, all right, I'm not even Russian.  And people are like, it's funny to...  Sometimes, as a comic, you know never to go into the YouTube comments. 
[02:54:00]  YouTube comments is the worst place you could go.  Yeah, because...  Way worse than even Twitter and Facebook.  To the point, I think someone sent me an article that YouTube's going to do something about that.  Well, they should.  How?  I don't know, but they have some kind of strategy they're going to roll out soon because they've  had it, basically.  Yeah.  Because they know most of these guys aren't even commenting on the videos or anything  anymore.  They're trolls.  They're just complete and other trolls with no real substance behind them.  Fuckers.  But the best are the people that are trying to be legitimate. 
[02:54:30]  Like, there was one lady that I read.  I don't know.  I think I was just born in a hotel room, and I was like, I'll just feel like shit about  myself for a little bit and read my YouTube comments.  One lady was like, his stage presence needs a little working on.  It's like, oh, who the fuck are you?  Fuck off.  Who the fuck?  You don't pay attention to that shit anymore, do you?  No, no, no.  But sometimes it is nice.  And you realize the bigger picture, it makes it a lot easier.  It's kind of funny to me.  People don't want to like you ever, so that's their whole job in life.  They will spend way too much time on you. 
[02:55:00]  And it's shit where I always think about these people would never have the balls to say this  to you in person.  No, never.  Ever in person.  People are just rude.  If someone had the balls after a show to walk up and say something they'd put on YouTube,  you'd be like, you're a sociopath.  Hey, Travis, I want to play the Conan Dan Soder thing that's getting a lot of heat.  Going in a break.  All right?  Or maybe we can find it here.  Yeah, I think it's...  It was on YouTube.  Yeah, that's what I was...  You have a problem with Conan?  No, no, no.  Not at all. 
[02:55:30]  I was saying that my Conan clip got a lot of...  Conan has embraced you.  A lot of exposure because of this Russian joke that a lot of people...  You should have slowed down when you told it then of something.  Yeah, well, here's your hat.  What's your hurry?  I couldn't think of nothing.  I have plugs before we go to break.  It's very important.  Oh, no.  Very special.  I think we're going to break.  I think, yeah.  I mean, that's the five-minute clip.  Oh, when we go to break, we're doing that.  Yeah.  Okay.  We're 10 to the show, whatever.  All right, back to Scott and Todd being featured every Friday on Jacktober. 
[02:56:00]  Todd continues to ignore Scott's additions to his story.  So we got more of the DMV story here.  Oh, good.  Thank God.  They took my picture and then she goes, stand back by the wall and wait till it prints.  That's exactly how they talk to you.  I'm like this.  You got it there.  Whatever you want.  Or else.  The next guy steps up.  She goes, well, where did you come from?  Off the street before this?  And he went like this.  Yes.  She don't even bat an eye.  She's like, all right.  Well, fine.  That explains why you have no address before this.  I think what happens. 
[02:56:30]  I think what happens, Todd, is they become hardened over the years with the people they  deal with.  AC was down in there yesterday, too.  It's about 112.  Wow.  That says a lot.  He just swatted them out of there.  It's like he never spoke.  He's done with them.  He's done with them.  Todd stinks, too, though.  His voice is fucking terrible.  He's trying to put on some kind of fucking Brooklyn thing.  It's almost like he's doing shitty New York sports talk radio. 
[02:57:00]  I'll tell you this.  Eli Manning is not.  No, it's the cadence, though.  I think I know what she was trying to do.  She told me what about it.  I'm trying to be horrible.  Who listens to this shit?  This dreck.  I'm imagining that Todd didn't even look at him as he spoke.  No, no.  He just was looking at someone else.  It's like trying to get in there.  Hey, I think what you were trying to do.  Yeah, you know who else was down there?  Am I a ghost?  Did I die?  They say we're down in there. 
[02:57:30]  Fuck, that's got to be brutal.  Hideous.  What's the matter, Spidey?  You put me on a pay-no-mind list?  You fucking stutter and mutter and prick you?  Dancing over.  Dancing over here, you fucking Todd shit fuck.  Dance for jokes over.  He's a hack.  His whole family's hacks.  He'd have grown up to be a hack.  Oh, young Sam Roberts running in.  He's prancing?  Yes, he's definitely prancercizing his way in. 
[02:58:00]  I told Sam this is the first time I ever saw him run was this morning, and now my opinion  on him has changed.  Oh, yeah.  He runs like a little fairy Mary.  He runs like a female doctor in the ER.  We're losing blood pressure.  Yes, that little shuffly run.  He runs like a gazelle with an itchy asshole.  That's what he runs like.  That's how I feel.  All right.  So then this was going to be saved, but fuck it, because it makes sense today, because  we're pointing out how weird Todd's voice is.  So you get to hear him transition into his regular voice when it's time to sell some shit. 
[02:58:30]  Obviously, he's putting on his stupid voice.  Crazy voice.  There's the tail end of his fake radio voice, and then Scott starts the live read, which  is just fun in and of itself.  And then Todd comes in, and it's like, who is this person?  Wow.  How's their Facebook page doing today?  Let's take a look.  Hopefully good.  We'll go to you in a second there, Sam, but first this.  I sat with some Yugoslavian child who was waiting for his grandmother who kept trying to touch 
[02:59:00]  my phone while I played games.  I had to break his little hand.  In case you have not heard, the best kind of gifts are the ones that come unexpectedly.  That's right.

[02:59:30]  That's Todd Pettengill.  Somebody smile.  You'll get 10 bright, cheerful sunflowers, a free voice.  Why doesn't he talk like that?  His regular voice is better.  His other voice is terrible.  It's cartoonish.  Is he doing that just to kind of keep up with the slowness that he's got?  He's mirroring his stroke speech.  Or is he trying to sound younger?  Maybe if I talk in a cadence, he'll understand what I'm saying.  Old man, can you hear the words I'm saying?  And a box of delicious cookies, all for just $24.99.

I hate about radio veterans.  These are guys that have been around for all these years.  Mm-hmm.  And listen to the fake shit.  They spit out their own voices.  Their dumb fake voices.  How fucking embarrassing.  That was insane.  That's embarrassing.  Amazing.  That was really bad.  That's Kaiser.  He Kaiser Soze.  Yes, he did.  Yes. 
[03:01:00]  He changes the limit.  He started that spot limping and was fucking sprinting at the end of it.  Kaiser.  So, in case you're wondering, the...  No.  Is that one of the greatest reveals ever, by the way?  Yeah, it's the best.  Holy fuck.  I saw that coming.  No.  I don't know what you said.  Scott talks about what movie he wants to see this weekend.  Yeah, this is a good one.  What do you mean it's good?  That sounds like just a normal thing to say on the radio.  Yep.  I gotta tell you what.  I'm going this weekend.  Gravity? 
[03:01:30]  Nope.  Runner Runner?  Nope.  What?  What?  I want to see the Bolt movie.  No, it's next week.  That's not this week, no.  Oh, confused grandpa.  The Bolt movie.  What's the Bolt movie?  Is that the Tom Hanks one, I guess?  That's got no comedy.  I'm a star.  I want comedy.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  The Bolt movie.  Sounds like a fucking retarded child saying, I want to see the Bolt movie.  That's the Bolt movie.  Ah, it's the Bolt movie.  Where's the Bolt movie?  With the skinnies. 
[03:02:00]  Where's the one where Tom Hanks kills the Africans?  The Bolt movie.  Oh, the Bolt.  Is that the one where he got the soccer ball and he calls him Leon or something?  Chases him around the desert.  Where's the Bolt?  The Bolt movie.  The Bolt movie.  Grandpa, there is no boat movie.  There's a boat movie.  The Bolt movie.  I hate movies.  That's not one where the Gilbert Grape kid falls in love with a girl and the boat goes  down.  The Bolt movie. 
[03:02:30]  Falls in love with a nice lady.  Oh, Timothy Hutton's hanging on the back of the thing and crying and Judd Hirsch.  That's the Bolt movie.  Because his brother fell over the boat.  And Buck couldn't hold on for you.  You're stronger than Buck.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  That's the one where you have to go to the sequel to the bus movie.  The Bolt movie.  I want to see the Bolt movie when they fight the shark.  They're the bigger boat.  The Bolt movie where they die to wear no life jacket. 
[03:03:00]  The shark eats them.  They're the bigger boat movie.  Sounds like I have Quint in my mouth.  I hear the fucking Bolt movie.  Yeah, well, we all DiCaprio falls in love with a girl.  She throws the hat in the water.  The boat movie.  The boat movie.  Oh, see that one.  They really are guessing like he's completely senile.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to start over because I really want you to appreciate this clip because there's  such a confidence in his voice.  That's the one where James Bond takes the underwater boat. 
[03:03:30]  He steals the underwater boat and goes somewhere and takes a bump down.  Well, we're a kid and a lion.  Go for a boat ride.  Go for a boat ride.  E-Rock went to that movie.  Don't look at something totally different.  Life of Pi, pretty short around E-Rock.  I can't stand it.  Bolt movie.  He doesn't even know what he's talking about. 
[03:04:00]  He's just guessing.  That sounded like a daughtering old fool man.  But the confidence.  Oh, yeah.  And he has everyone's attention.  And they're all playing along.  Is it?  Is it?  Yeah, yeah.  Is it?  He's feeling pretty good.  Like, they're finally paying attention to me.  And then he gets that fucked up.  I'm just queer with his frosted tips.  Not looking at me.  Look at me now.  Don't you, son?  A boat mover.  A boat mover.  Showing out this weekend. 
[03:04:30]  Ah, here we go.  I won, right?  The boat turned upside down and the fat woman drowned.  Ah, that Christopher Lee was living in it.  Part two.  A boat mover.  No, it's next week, Grandpa.  It's not even coming out this weekend.  I know.  I know.  That's the beauty of it.  We're starting over because the confidence is awesome.  I got to hear him say the boat mover.  Everyone's playing along.  He's got everyone's attention.  I'm going to move.  And then, boom, no payoff again.  I got to tell you what.  I'm going this weekend.  Gravity?  Nope. 
[03:05:00]  Runner Runner?  Nope.  What?  What?  I want to see the boat movie.  No, it's next week.  That's not this week.  No.  Not yet.  The 11th.  They were doing all the reviews in the paper.  Yeah.  Well, because it premiered at the New York Film Festival.  It's called Captain Phillips.  Yeah.  Don't look for a movie called The Boat Movie.  You're just openly mocking him.  Yeah.  Don't look for a movie called The Boat Movie.  Now, last year, we got a great fucking clip.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I think we got one already.  We got a new one.  He's The Boat Movie.  I wrote The Boat Movie.  I want to say The Boat Movie. 
[03:05:30]  I want to say The Boat Movie.  I like their reaction.  Their reaction is basically, shut up.  Yeah, yeah.  Shut up, you old fools.  And meanwhile, they stink too.  Yes, they do.  I think I've turned the corner.  I think Todd is worse because his voice is such a fucking put-on, shit-hack radio voice.  Yeah.  I can't even get...  Scott's at least just fucking old and finished.  But I think he's...  I think he did it for survival, though, in a weird way. 
[03:06:00]  You think it's like...  Yeah.  That's terrible.  Like one of those victims of abuse, like, just started having an English accent?  Well, yeah.  Humphrey Bogart, you're going to see The Boat Movie.  What's next?  The Boat Movie.  The Boat Movie.  I think it works on Al Q.  It's about some fruit.  The African Queen.  The Boat Movie.  The Boat.  You guys have to see The Boat Movie?  The Boat Movie.  It's just him mumbling into his soup.  That's great.  You ever see the other one?  There's like a lot of Boat Movie. 
[03:06:30]  Where was that one?  It just blew them up.  Not the Space Movie.  The Boat Movie.  Yeah, there's a lot of Hawaiians in it, and they blew up a bunch of boats.  It was the Blow Up the Boats Movie.  The Boats Down Air is my favorite book.  What?  I want to see The Boat Movie.  We got a clip.  That's a clip.  We got a clip.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  I feel like that's like...  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Like he's in his wheelchair at the ticket office at the movie theater. 
[03:07:00]  How many tickets, sir?  The Boat Movie.  What is that?  The Boat Movie.  We don't have something called The Boat Movie.  The Boat Movie.  He starts ringing the bell.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  It's perfect, though.  It's clean.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Get that on our machine immediately.  It's clean.  He's like Tuco's uncle.  He just keeps sitting there.  Hit the bell.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  The Boat Movie.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Ding, ding.  What?  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Oh, is he doddering? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, that's great.  What?  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Yeah, I want to see The Boat Movie.  You know.  What movie is that?  The Boat Movie.  What?  I want to see The Boat Movie.  It's like he's just sitting there.  That is this year's I Got a Tree on my house.  It's like you got to deal with an older relative and you're finally like, what?  Yeah.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Just keeps slamming his wheelchair under your head.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Morty wants to see The Boat Movie. 
[03:08:00]  Lee, Lee, after you're done with the Swiffer, let's go see The Boat Movie.  Yes, your father won't stop talking about The Boat Movie.  The Boat Movie.  Why do you?  We're not going to go to the movies.  It's Thursday.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Oh, you always want to see The Boat Movie.  What?  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Okay, but you just need to take your pills first.  Yeah, don't worry.  Just take your medication and we'll show you the movie. 
[03:08:30]  You mean Captain Phillips?  What?  I want to see The Boat Movie.  The Boat Movie.  That's what I say.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  I want to describe it as The Boat Movie.  A dummy.  An old dummy.  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Then Todd comes back in his normal voice.  Hey, everybody.  Just a little.  Scott fell asleep in the studio.  Yeah.  Fake. 
[03:09:00]  He's worse to me.  What?  I want to see The Boat Movie.  Are there any more?  That's, well.  He's got to be more close.  Well, how's the Facebook page going, first of all?  There's some really.  Phase one is complete because there's no public wall.  Right.  But you can comment on the comments.  There's some nasty comments on their posts.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, they can't.  There's giant swastikers.  They can't post pictures.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  What happened there?  And then there's a giant post that's just, uh, um, over and over and over again. 
[03:09:30]  Wow.  Can you add the I want to see The Boat Movie to the intro to Jocktober?  Oh, I don't see why not.  Immediately?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  I was like, The Boat Movie.  Immediately.  I want to say The Boat Movie.  Oh.  So, uh, we're going to end, uh, today's Jocktober with Scott and Todd.  It's going to be Scott and Todd Fridays during the month of Jocktober.  It's the first one.  Because it's too good to just do one. 
[03:10:00]  Um, well, you know, uh, they like to play games on their show.  Mm-hmm.  And now we're going to take their game and we're going to play our own game today.  Yes.  See, we're trying to do things a little differently this year.  Just a little bit.  I wanted to infuse some competition into Jocktober this year.  The game is called How Long Before You Tap Out.  And the reason we're playing this, it's time for a Todd phone scam.  Oh, the phone scams. 
[03:10:30]  It's a staple of the Scott and Todd morning show.  And we explain this every year.  Phone scams, by the way, you're not allowed to do them anymore.  You used to be able to just call people, put it on the air.  Now you have to inform.  Yeah.  We love doing them.  You have to inform the person that is on the phone at the time that they are on the air.  Even if it's pre-recorded.  You have to say, you're being recorded for the radio.  So you can't do these anymore.  You're not going to say, hey, it's a, you know, you're on the air, but forget that.  And now I'm going to phone scam you. 
[03:11:00]  So they're all fake.  Bullshit.  These are all actors, paid phone actors and station people.  And they play these off.  And if you can't tell just by listening to how fake and phony and badly acted this is,  you're an idiot.  It's not fake.  It is.  Well.  Fucking hilarious.  I'm not even going to tell you how long this phone scam is.  And really try to hang in there.  God, those tacos smell good.  Because I know the bit would be to tap out quick.  Yes, yes. 
[03:11:30]  So at least try.  Give it some effort today.  And you can pause and comment without tapping out.  Sure.  So it's time for the Todd phone scam.  He does the phone scams and he does the song parodies.  Those tacos do smell fucking good.  Or the boat movie.  I'm at a crossroad right here.  Oatmeal?  Tacos.  I mean, I don't think you're at really that much of a decision.  I'm fucking waiting.  Stealing things. 
[03:12:00]  I want a taco.  Ah, the Mexicans cook well.  Yeah, they certainly do.  I like the Mexicans.  Here comes some good video, listeners.  How the tacos.  Oops.  Amazing.  I dropped the taco.  Huh?  I just had a couple of corn chips.  What's that?  Corn chips.  I love corn chips.  The food segments do.  They just add.  They don't take away from anything.  No, absolutely.  They don't stop anything.  They fucking run themselves, man.  You ever do the food fucking segments on this?  There we go. 
[03:12:30]  Programming?  They run themselves.  I got tacos on my plate.  Hey, looks like someone took a cancer shit on your plate.  With the pineapple salsa?  Oh, fuck.  Which one is these?  These are the pulled pork.  Pull fucking, pull my pork.  That's it.  What is that?  One more.  There we go.  Are they healthy?  I'm set.  Yeah, they're healthy.  They're not healthy.  Yeah, they're small.  It's pulled pork. 
[03:13:00]  The ants over there are Taco City or something.  Oh, shit.  You hear what I said?  What do we have to thank for the tacos, Roland?  She's coming down in one second.  She's making it one more taco.  That's pretty good.  Oh, boy.  Look at how Roland handles food.  It's amazing.  It's like a baby.  It's like he has food.  He's very funny.  It's like he has a newborn kitten in his hand.  You see that?  It's a shrimp taco.  He was holding the head of the taco carefully.  I don't want onions.  Wait, what is that one, Roland? 
[03:13:30]  No, that's shrimp with pickled onions.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  Wow.  It's like if I'm suing you, it's called a restaurant.  It's very, very good.  Oh, my God.  Which is the one with the pineapple seals on?  Yeah.  Here's the Todd phone scam, and we're playing today how long it takes to tap out.  Yeah, but is this really playing?  Because this seems like you're just going to put it on and then enjoy some tacos.  No, no, no.  I mean, I think that's...  No, we wouldn't do that.  You're just...  Now you're just punishing the listeners.  Ready?  Yeah.  Ready.  We received an email from Ali who wanted us to set up Sam. 
[03:14:00]  He works at a clothing store.  Apparently found something that didn't belong to him and decided to keep it.  Wait, what happened?  Sam, I tapped out of the setup.  Well, Sam...  Wow, it's only 10 seconds in and I tapped out officially.  I didn't even mean to tap out.  You can't tap out.  What happened?  What's the setup?  It's a clothing store.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The boy took something they weren't supposed to.  They found something.  And this is what happened.  Look out.  Hey, everybody. 
[03:14:30]  Welcome back.  I didn't even like it if they did that.  This is going to be one of these impossible situations that would never happen in real life.  Or that no one would give a shit about.  That's going to be so apathetic.  Right, right.  They were like, fuck off if you called me.  We received an email from Allie who wanted us to set up Sam.  He works at a clothing store.  Apparently found something that didn't belong to him and decided to keep it.  The mistake he made was telling Allie and the mistake she made was telling me.  This is called outlet outrage.  Thanks for calling me.  Hey, how you doing over there? 
[03:15:00]  I'm fine.  Can I have Sam?  Sam, just hold one second.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Hi, can I help you?  This is Sam.  Yes.  You're the one with the glasses.  I'm sorry, have we met?  Yeah, listen Sam, why don't I shoot down there and pick it up?  Pick what up, sir?  I'll be down here in like an hour and we can pick it up, all right?  Sir, you're going to have to help me out here.  I'm not real sure what you're...  Well, you're the one who found my money in the dressing room.  What money?  Oh my God, you can hear the cut-ins.  You heard that, right?  Yep, yep.  That might be a little too inside for people. 
[03:15:30]  We can hear that.  But it's the punch-ins where something didn't work there, so he redid it.  It used to be a staple of Rocco's show.  Yes, oh, you're a radio guy.  The old Vox Pro.  You can hear it.  But you can always hear the volume change.  And he didn't leave enough...  Yeah, you hear that hum, buzz, and then it cuts.  And he didn't leave enough space to make it sound a little more natural.  It's punched in.  Or are they just doing it separately like a pre-record?  Oh.  Oh.  Like his one...  Remember how I did the Alan Alda thing?  Oh, God.  I wonder if they're just reading scripts at separate times. 
[03:16:00]  Sure.  Listen room.  What money?  Now, now, wait a minute.  I was in there trying on a pair of them slouchy skinny jeans.  Uh-huh.  Like a month ago or something.  And then my people...  Oh my God.  I got to keep stopping.  Uh-huh.  I know exactly what he's doing.  Yeah.  It's one of the oldest tricks in radio.  You take...  He goes, uh-huh.  Yeah.  So that uh-huh was from somewhere else.  And then he added it there just to kind of keep his fucking shit going along.  Yeah.  Or to make it sound like it was real.  Right.  But it's so obvious it's not.  It is, you know, fake. 
[03:16:30]  You know your way around a Vox Pro dance order.  Did a lot of it.  Listen for the uh-huh.  But it's like uh-huh.  Ouchy skinny jeans.  Uh-huh.  Like a month ago or something.  And then my people tell me that you're the individual who has my cash.  I don't have anybody's cash.  Are you sure you...  Why don't you think harder on that?  Because I've been in Zimbabwe in my knife factory.  I make machetes and bayonets and swords.  Oh.  Well, I don't make them.  Uh-huh.  But, you know, import, export.  So I'd like to get my money back.  I'm here in a country now and I want to get it.  Uh, I wish I could help you out, sir, but I actually don't know what you're talking about. 
[03:17:00]  I definitely don't have anybody's money.  You don't have my $800.  I'm not the sort of person who would hang on to somebody else's $800.  Yeah, you didn't just buy a coat that cost $450?  Uh, well, yeah.  I might have bought a coat.  I want the coat.  Uh.  And whatever's left.  I'm not good at the math.  You figure it out.  Uh, it's going to be a little difficult.  It is, huh?  Yeah.  Uh.  You know what?  Let's for a second say I believe that you don't have my money, okay? 
[03:17:30]  So let me run down plan B for you.  Okay.  Plan B is I jump in my Hummer.  I drive to the outlet there.  I park my vehicle.  I meander into your establishment.  And I beat you for 800 minutes.  Uh.  I tap.  That's all right.  I, uh.  What part don't we understand?  Yeah.  It's fucking hilarious.  You guys are nuts.  I'm tapping.  You like it, Chip?  Fuck yeah.  He got him good.  This is a douchey.  Like the fact that the guy didn't go, what do you mean?  I bought a coat.  How do you know that? 
[03:18:00]  Right.  Well, it's almost over, right?  Well.  Yeah.  Who's this?  How do you know I bought a coat?  What are you talking about?  Fuck you.  You make knives?  Fuck you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Bring a machete to a gunfight, you dumb fuck.  Should I tell him?  I'm going to your establishment, and I beat you for 800 minutes.  Uh.  Sir, I, uh.  What part don't we understand here?  Let's, uh.  Let's just calm things down a little bit.  I'm going to jump in my Hummer.  I'm going to drive to the outlet.  We get it.  I'm going to park my vehicle.  I'll meander into your establishment. 
[03:18:30]  He sent us ready.  And I will beat you for 800 minutes.  Let's just calm down for a second.  I'm sure we can.  Oh, I'm calm.  We can work something out.  Then again, I didn't take somebody's $800.  Right.  Well, there's no need to resort to violence.  I'm sure we can.  No, huh?  No.  No one would say this.  We can figure something out.  You know how long an 800-minute beating is?  No.  I don't know.  It's about 13 hours.  Fuck yeah.  I doubt you lived through something like that.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm not good at math.  I might be off.  But I am good at beating people for 13 hours. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, I'm getting that.  My upper body is awesome.  I'm all torso.  Yeah.  Well, listen, sir.  You know, I'm hoping we'd be able to work this out.  I just thought of how we can work it out.  Okay.  You can give me my freaking money back.  Well, look, it's a little tricky for me to get the coat back at this point.  What's your coat?  Yeah, it is my coat.  But you bought it with my money.  Right.  Are you going to admit that it's my money?  Uh, no, I'm not. 
[03:19:30]  I'm not admitting anything.  You know, I'd be more than happy to share the coat.  This is so bad.  It's not even.  And we had fun up to this point.  Yeah.  It's not.  And it's too long.  Uh-huh.  Way too long.  It's a six-minute call, by the way.  Oh, it's like your friend who thinks he's funny, but he's not.  He got him, though.  And if the call.  Oh, my gosh.  He did get him.  If you know you got a long call, the first part where he talks to some person before they  get the other person, you could cut all that out just to make it move along faster.  And a lot of the fake fear is the worst part. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, sir, please call me.  Who would do that?  You'd hang up.  I'd rather hear Voss doing Shakespeare.  Oh, God.  Ah.  A few fiddle-smooth things.  All right, listen, I'm not going to share a coat.  What, you got it on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and I got it Tuesday, Thursday?  We can't share a coat.  You bought the coat with my money.  Well, let's just say I was able to, you know, recover and return the money to its rightful  owner.  What would happen then?  I would jump in my helmet.  Right.  I would drive to the outlet.  I would park my vehicle and meander into your establishment, allow you to return whatever 
[03:20:30]  portion of my money it is that you have, and then on principle, I would punch you  one time in the esophagus.  How hard a punch or worry?  Oh, God.  We can't do that.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Really?  Oh, come on.  You guys, this is real stuff.  If you are a listener of Scott and Todd, and that was just a clear fuck you to them,  like to their listeners.  They're like, you're dumb.  Do you think someone's driving, listening, going, oh, my God.  Oh, no. 
[03:21:00]  He's going to, he asked how hard it was.  Oh, this would get to work, and you got to see, did you listen to Scott and Todd, the  phone scam?  I wish I could play it back for you.  Oh, this is awesome.  How hard a punch were we talking about?  Well, I'm out $800, so I guess it would be about an $800 punch in the esophagus.  That sounds like, can we negotiate the punch down?  I don't understand what that means.  Well, it's just, that sounds like an awfully hard punch.  I mean, maybe it's a, you know.  You took something that didn't belong to you. 
[03:21:30]  I'm saying I, it might be possible that I could, you know, recover the item in question.  It's not item, it's money.  Well, there's an item.  Yeah, well, you know what?  I don't want the coat.  I changed my mind.  That cut was so bad.  The cuts are blatant.  Just, I gotta be honest, we were guilty of that ourselves when we had a Vox Pro, so  I know how this works.  You just had to trim the fat.  Yeah, you pumped some shit up a little bit.  Yeah, trim the fat.  Some of those dead spots where you're trying to think of the next thing to say, and then 
[03:22:00]  you cut the dead spot out, and you seem like you're a fucking amazing, smart, fast whip.  A machine!  Look at me.  I fucking instantly hit her with that line.  Meanwhile, in reality, you're just sitting there with dead air going,  It's like, how hard of a punch?  How do you edit things into a bad improv?  Yes.  Yes.  That's awesome.  That's what they've done.  This is bad if it was done.  If this was done under the fucking conditions of Deer Hunter when they're playing Russian roulette,  this would still be bad. 
[03:22:30]  Diddy Mow!  Yes.  Miss Money.  Well, there's an item.  Yeah, well, you know what?  I don't want the coat.  I changed my mind.  I just want all $800.  I want it all back.  And I'll be down there in like, I don't know, give me an hour.  An hour, huh?  And then comes the 800-minute beatdown.  Right.  Well, I...  How much can you come up with?  I still have...  Well, I think I could recover about $350 this morning.  But why would you give someone $350 if, in fact, you weren't the guilty party? 
[03:23:00]  It's possible that I am in contact with that person.  Oh, so you're saying it's not you, but you know the person.  Yeah.  You know what happens when you lie?  You get nine punches in the esophage.  Oh, my God.  Maybe we put you on a payment schedule.  Listen, I think I can help you out.  I think I can come up with the full amount.  Oh, you can?  Yeah, I think that can be arranged.  Don't leave early or anything.  Because then I have to get Allie involved.  How do you know Allie?  Well, she set you up. 
[03:23:30]  What do you mean?  This is PLJ Radio.  You've just been phone-scaned.  Oh!  I'm going to kill her.  I hope you don't get a call like this for real, my friend.  Me too.  Yeah!  You know how long an 800-minute beating is?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Money.  You know all money.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[03:24:00]  You've been phone-scaned again.  Oh, God.  Could it be any busier?  You've been phone-scaned again.  They are truly terrible.  It's terrible radio.  It's New York radio.  First off, you would almost accept this from a small market.  There's so much there that sucks.  That's the kind of...  In the fake scenario, let's pretend that this guy's real.  All right.  Let's just pretend.  If you're a real piece of shit and you steal $800 from your work, 
[03:24:30]  you're not going to be like,  I think at the party,  you're going to be like,  fuck you.  Yeah, yeah.  Come down here.  Yeah, come down.  I'll be waiting for your ass.  Fuck you, man.  You describe the clothing someone else has on.  Right.  I'm wearing a red jacket.  Now I'll go into 20 minutes about how I'm going to punch you in the esophagus.  And if I change it to schedule...  Yeah, that's funny.  Yeah.  I want to see the boat movie.  It's in the back.  You can just hear him yelling at him.  Margo boat movie.  I'm not good at math.  Third time I said that.  God, I'm going to meander. 
[03:25:00]  Get in my Hummer.  He was proud of himself when he came up with meander.  Because he used it a lot.  He thought everyone would be walking around New York using the word meander because of  his phone scam.  And then he told the guy he was going to meander down to his job.  And I'm going to meander in.  Fuck you.  Terrible.  All right.  There you go.  Truly terrible radio.  That was it, huh?  Scott and Todd Friday is off to a great start.  Good one.  For the month of Jacktober, that's what we will be doing.  And the tacos, by the way, are ridiculous. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  From Sue Torres.  Honestly, it's...  Where is she?  Amazingly good.  I remember you from the food show, I think.  When you were on Roland's food show?  Yeah.  I've been on Top Chef Masters and Iron Shop.  She was never on your show then?  No, yeah, no.  Oh, I know you from TV then.  All right.  No, I recognize you, but I thought I met you on Roland's food court.  You were on the cooking show.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  The food show. 
[03:26:00]  That's what I do.  I cook.  Yeah.  That was amazing food.  You ever been on a boat?  Where did we get the taco?  She's a nice lady.  Oh, sorry.  I thought, okay.  I just feel bad that she got up early to make tacos, so I want to make sure she gets  the proper plug in.  Uh-huh.  I apologize.  The restaurant is spelled S-U-E-N-O-S, so is that Suenos?  Suenos.  Spanish for dreams.  And it's on West 17th Street, 311 West 17th.  That's between 8th and 9th.  And it's all like, what kind of food is it?  It's all tacos?  Well, no, it's Mexican food.  It's authentic Mexican technique and flavors. 
[03:26:30]  It's tough to get authentic.  For New York market.  It's tough to get authentic Mexican food.  We make our own tortillas in the dining room and make the guacamole to order.  Where?  Downtown?  Downtown?  Yes, Chelsea.  There's about a Staten Island Ferry, because there's a lot of boats.  I want to see the boat.  On the boat movie.  I want to go to the theater.  Unbelievable.  I want to eat tacos on a boat.  I want to eat a taco on a boat.  On a boat watching the boat movie.  Oh, thank you for that one. 
[03:27:00]  We'll be using that one for a while.  Oh, I love it.  We'll be using the tree one.  I want to see the boat movie.  Boat movie.  What a fucking old fool.  What kind of tacos, by the way?  The pineapple thing, that is a great combination in a taco.  That's classic.  See, that's taco self-pastor.  So it's pork rubbed with red cheese.  Taco, blah, blah, blah.  How many voices do you do?  Oh, a million of them.  Are you uncomfortable with the taco lady? 
[03:27:30]  No, they're good.  Okay.  They're really good.  I love them.  And the guacamole and the chips, what's that, are very good.  I'm just pigging out.  Oh, good.  I might bring a young lady in for dinner.  You should.  You absolutely should.  These are unbelievable, yeah.  Yeah, we eat.  And then the coconut shrimp ones are with avocado and cured red onions.  So that's very, like, tropical, kind of Caribbean, Catan, Baracruz region.  I had the shrimp ones.  They were fantastic.  And I didn't think, to be honest, I don't typically like stuff like a different kind of taco. 
[03:28:00]  Do you like fish tacos?  I never had them.  Do you do fish tacos?  I love fish tacos.  Do you eat the tuna taco?  So we change it up.  Right now it's tuna, actually.  It is?  Tuna tacos?  I like the old tuna taco.  Not tuna fish.  It's real tuna.  Right.  Yeah.  Chip likes tuna tacos.  Not that fake tuna, right?  Not fake tuna.  You know, most of the restaurants are using that fake stuff.  Wait, what's this fake stuff?  They say about 90% of the restaurants and supermarkets that sell tuna, it's the fake one. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, it's peanut butter.  And it makes your ass leak.  Ew.  I mean, I...  She knows.  Tell them.  Back me up here.  It does.  Not if your ass is leaking.  It's sort of in the tuna family, so they can kind of get away with it, but it's not traditional  tuna that you're looking for.  So my regular tuna sandwich from Subway is probably not tuna.  Oh, no.  Hell no.  Hell no.  They throw every fish in there.  Well, yeah.  They don't sort that shit in the net.  It's tuna taco.  Yes, it's lizard anus pounded with a hammer. 
[03:29:00]  These are tuna fish.  The plug again, because we're running out of show.  It is...  The food is genuinely good.  It's...  How do you say it?  Sueños.  Sueños.  And it's on 311 West 17th Street between 8th and 9th.  And I guess you have a bunch of these little tacos?  Yeah.  So we do happy hour every day from 5 to 7.  And we're closed Monday, so you buy one and the second one is on us.  And then today we're doing the taco special for National Taco Day. 
[03:29:30]  So it's six tacos for $12.  It includes two of the beef tacos that you tried, two of the shrimp tacos, and then two  vegetable tacos with avocado tempura.  Damn.  Wow.  We always have those little mini hard-shelled beef tacos.  We always have the tacos pastor.  We always have the coconut shrimp.  Tacos pastor.  Tacos pastor.  How hard is it to get a reservation?  It's not hard.  Just come on in.  Yeah.  Give us a call.  Good Mexican food's hard to find.  That is pretty good.  I only found one Mexican place I like in New York, so that'd be nice to have another one. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  I could never get in there because it's crazy.  I like Taco Bell.  They make pretty good tacos.  Oh, Jesus.  It's crazy.  We have a song parody about the meat.  It's really funny.  Oh, kill it up!  Oh, Jesus.  Nothing more insulting than saying I like Taco Bell to the taco lady.  You're a real chef.  I actually hate Taco Bell.  I know a lot of people actually...  Hey, you know who could participate in a happy hour today?  Huh?  E-Rock.  No.  She's not happy.  Hope he gave away his phone to him. 
[03:30:30]  He did?  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You know, being reminded of all the dread that you caused.  Oh, boy.  I do have an update.  Oh, I want to hear.  We leave you with this update from you.  We leave you.  One of E-Rock's peeps.  Yeah.  I really don't know what to say to you right now.  Ouch.  They're still in furious mode.  Is that...  Wait.  Is that E-Rock or is he emailing...  It's one of his peeps.  He might be texting through their phone.  I don't even...  Oh.  That's probably him. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, there might be a connection.  That's probably him.  Yeah.  That's probably not...  Oh, my God.  You are in a fucking shitstorm.  Yeah.  This isn't the...  This is before the worst beating.  When you're like, your parent will be like, oh, I'm not mad.  Oh, boy.  It's like an 800-minute beating.  Yeah.  You're going to have to...  You know what's going to happen is E-Rock's going to meander down here.  Roland just meandered over and took a taco.  You're going to have to send your wife as a diplomat to his wife.  They're going to be meeting on the bridge.  Like Secretary of State.  They're going to sit in those uncomfortable chairs with a table in the middle that they show 
[03:31:30]  on the news.  Angled at each other.  Yeah, angled.  Not really looking or talking.  It's like, yeah, well, you gave away my number.  It's going to be like Diane Sawyer's interview with Saddam Hussein.  Very uncomfortable.  All right.  All right.  This is way too real.  You get to go home and forget about it.  Oh, I certainly do.  I'm going to have to live this one for a long time.  It really is.  Taco Lady, thank you.  Amazing.  Yes, thank you very much.  Sue Torres.  I got Pearl Jam tickets for you.  What?  That's good.  I got Pearl Jam tickets for you. 
[03:32:00]  Makes good fucking tacos in our Freddy Krueger shirt.  You want me to play my part?  That's great.  I got Pearl Jam tickets for you.  I'll play my part.  What?  Really?  Yes.  No, I don't.  No, I do.  You do?  Where'd you get them?  Don't worry there, Anthony.  I got people.  I'm not going, but I want something from it.  Why are you talking Mexican right now?  Because he's got tacos in his mouth.  He's got tacos in his mouth.  He's talking Mexican.  You don't want me to be a people.  The Star Wars shirt kind of takes away from the tough vato guy.  He's like, what's up, home? 
[03:32:30]  Hey.  Hey.  I'm solo as a vato, is he?  Did you see that, Dan?  I bite your cat.  You know what the hossa is?  It's Iraq that don't fly straight.  Dan Soder, pleasure.  Yeah, thanks for having me again.  Stress Factory this weekend.  I highly recommend everyone goes out and sees Dan Soder at the Stress Factory.  We're going to end with his Conan bit that's getting a lot of heat online.  But first.  What happened?  Well, I want to ask you if you ever miss your favorite TV shows because your DVR is full. 
[03:33:00]  Why do you change your voice for the live read?  Most DVRs don't give it the space you need.  What if you want to record the boat movie?  Hey, you got what?  I don't have 2,000 hours of boat movies.  I got it all.  What's that?  The King, Mutiny.  I got Amistad, Titanic, Life of Pi, The Burmary.  Yeah.  Come on.  2,000 hours of shows, movies, sports, anything.  You don't have to worry about what to delete.  You can keep it all.  And get this. 
[03:33:30]  When you enable the Hopper, the Hopper's Auto Hop feature, you can watch Primetime Network  TV commercial free.  Unlike other DVRs, no fast forwarding required.  You can spend time watching your shows without any annoying interruptions.  I want to see the boat movie.  Well, if you want to see the boat movie, you can see it on your fucking Hopper DVR.  Call them 1-800-WATCH-TV.  I want to see the boat movie.  Well, you can.  Get all the DVR space you need to put all those boat movies on.  And it'll be interruption-free entertainment.  What?  I want to see the boat movie.  Well, you'd need the Hopper, then, from Dish to fit all your boat movies. 
[03:34:00]  2,000 hours.  I want to see the boat movie.  2,000 hours of boat movies, you doddering old prick.  Just call them at 1-800-WATCH-TV.  I have a plug before we play the...  Yes, Jimmy.  Yes.  I got a plug, too.  Friday, Saturday, I'm out working new material.  October 18, 19, Stitches Comedy Club in Lancaster.  It's cheaper tickets.

And I'm going to plug this cancer benefit for this listener, where I will be away, but...  Who would want to support cancer?  It's terrible.  Well, it's because cancer's not doing well, and they really want to help the cancer all.  Man.  Otto and Bob Levy and Big Jay are going to be there.  It's Saturday, October 19th.  It's 2 in the afternoon, if you're in New York.  It's the Bitter End on Bleecker Street, right down there by the cellar. 
[03:35:00]  Go to brownpapertickets.com and search for Cancer Sucks.  And it's a really good cause, and it's a great comedy show.  Bullying cancer.  I don't like that.  I believe we're a fan of the show, right?  Yes.  Big fan of the show.  Yes.  All right.  I got a slight plug.  Oh.  I took one of Anthony's concepts and made a really good video that's doing really fucking  well.  It's fucking funny, man.  Kiefer Sutherland is promoting Jose Cuervo.  Yeah.  And, well, I took some of the clips, actually, we talked about on the show and did a mashup. 
[03:35:30]  I'm excited to do it.  Yeah.  So Kiefer's really selling the tequila in the right way.  So check it out on my YouTube channel, OP Radio.  If you go to OP Radio on YouTube, I believe it's right on the front page of my channel.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  And with that, we go to Dan Soders.  Oh, come on.  Oh, boy.  How'd you sleep last night?

I decided to play Russian Roulette.  That was...  Spin the cylinder.  Wee.  For the hell of it.  When's the baby do?  For the hell of it, I decided to play Russian Roulette.  I said that to a lady once and she's like, 
[03:37:30]  I ain't having a baby, I'm like, I'm a boat movie.  He can fucking pass.  He just fucking stomps all over Jimmy with the...  Who did that?  Uh-oh.  It was a mistake.  Travis almost had a perfect week on the board.  Travis almost had a perfect week.  He almost had a perfect week on the board.  He got us with a rejoiner yesterday that said at the end of the show when we were leaving  that said, stick around for more Opie and Anthony.  Just trying to give a tribute to my good friend down at Disney.  And then today he fucking got all nervous Nelly and hit the fucking nuke button. 
[03:38:00]  I was previewing something because you guys are doing reads.  Oh, you were previewing...  There's a very good possibility E-Rock's gonna resign and, you know...  I might be here full time.  I might be there full time.  Oh, man.  Uh, sorry about that, Jimmy.  It happens.  Wait, no, I'll do it again.  Okay.  Oh, don't go...  Don't leave because I'm gonna go with that.  But go.  What was I saying?  Well, I decided to play Russian roulette with the taco lady.  It could have either been too many tacos or she's pregnant.  And I just...  Oh, man.  I decided to take a shot at it.  Yeah.  I said that to a lady one time.  I'm like, are you pregnant?  And she goes, no. 
[03:38:30]  I'm like, oh, it looks like you've just been eating then.  How'd that work out?  What'd she say?  She was like, that's rude, Chipper.  Yeah.  Never happened.  The whole scenario didn't happen.  Yeah.  Well, you could tell.  Just look at the nice full breasts.  Well, yeah.  I mean, Roland.  Wind up with...  Oh, geez.  Roland.  Slap me five, Roland.  Remember that one?  Slap me five.  Oh, I remember that.  Oh, boy. 
[03:39:00]  Roland really enjoys that one.  Oh, it's raucous.  He likes it.  We're gonna leave you with the comedic...  Slap me five.  Biker thug side.  Oh.  We're gonna leave you with the comedic stylings of Dan Soda, who's gonna be at Stress Factory  tonight and tomorrow night.  Very funny comic.  I hope you go see him if you're in the area.  I'm sure there's a few tickets later on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you guys play?  Come on out.  He's still on the way up stage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm serious.  Go see Dan.  Intimate evenings is how it previews. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, like a good intimate evening.  He was on Conan recently, and the clip of it is up to 1.5 million views.  Damn!  That's not too fucking shabby.  Yeah.  And it's a bit called Russians are Scary.  I want to play this today for everybody, all right?  Well, thanks for having me, guys.  Thank you, Dan.  Go cramp.  I currently live in New York City, which is, yeah, you know, it's there.  I've been living in New York about six years now, and when I first moved there, I had  a huge fear I was gonna get mugged.  Constantly.  Like, every time I left the house, I was like, here it comes. 
[03:40:00]  Someone's gonna take everything.  I got over my fear because I learned a trick, and now I use this trick all the time.  Whenever I think someone might try to beat me up or mug me, I fake a Russian accent.  You're welcome.  It's genius.  I'll be walking home late at night.  Two dangerous-looking thugs walk up to me like, yo, man, you know what neighborhood you're  in?  You think this bad neighborhood? 
[03:40:30]  Russians are the scariest white people.  They've earned it.  I'm so scared of them that I guarantee you if I was lost, dangerously lost, there is  no way I'd ask a Russian for directions.  Just real quick, like, sir, help me.  Please help me.  How do I get to the subway?  The subway? 
[03:41:00]  Walk down the street and turn the corner.  Yeah, screw that.  I think I'm just gonna stay lost.  Thank you guys very much.  You guys are great.  I want to see you in a boat movie.  The Opie and Anthony show is available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next! 
[03:41:30]  This is after Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  God damn.  Even all the way from Florida, E-Rock can't help but impact the show.  I mean, I've never encountered an impact player like this guy. 
[03:42:00]  He's gotta be so fucking pissed.  I would be.  My God, let me start with 820.  820, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Sam and Pride and Time, Robert.  How are you doing today?  Good, buddy.  How are you doing?  I'm doing well.  Hey, I got a couple quick things.  First off, have you seen the Arsherio Paul show with the Ultimate Warrior?  The what show?  You know Paul Scheer?  The guy from the league?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:42:30]  He has a show where he reenacts old Arsenio Hall shows from the 80s.  Oh, yeah, okay, I know.  He comes on and plays the people who were the guests.  I think I might have seen that.  It's funny.  Really funny.  Yeah, secondly, Sam Roberts' show online this week.  Best episode yet with Ari Shaffir.  That was fucking awesome, man.  Well, thank you very much.  Dan Soder is gonna be back here in a minute.  He had to take a massive shit.  He said while we were waiting for the show to come back on, 
[03:43:00]  he said that he was worried about shitting himself.  So I said, you know, why don't you go, why don't you clear out your colon, come in here, free mind, free bowels, and really, you know, get ready to light this candle.  Wow, those tacos must have been really fucking good then.  I guess they did the trick, huh?  I guess so.  All right, all I got left is your plug, Sam Roberts' show, 4 p.m. Eastern, XM 103, Sirius 206, what the fuck ever. 
[03:43:30]  I'm a little drunk, Sammy, just deal with it.  Don't worry about it.  You have to be drunk sometimes to enjoy this, yeah.  Exactly.  I'm in Korea, it's 1130, I'd deal with it.  Sick.  Sam Roberts' show online, listening to the audience, that's all I got, buddy.  Awesome, thanks a lot.  Yes, you can download my podcast with Ari Shafir on the internet.  586.  Hey, Sam, it's Jason from Detroit.  What's up, Jason?  I'm just surprised that once E-Rock found out that his phone number was released, he didn't go on his Twitter and just write down Opie's number.  I guess he's being strategic about this.  I don't know exactly what his plan is. 
[03:44:00]  I think this goes, because E-Rock's in a weird position, because on one end, Opie's been a friend to him.  So he's like, okay, I have a personal relationship with this guy.  Obviously, not only do they have each other's phone numbers, but he knows him, he talks to him at home, you know.  And now he goes on the air, and he does, he did it accidentally.  Opie accidentally gave out E-Rock's cell phone number on the air today.  And E-Rock is in a tough spot, because on one end, he could just go on Twitter and blast it and put Opie's phone number out there and, you know, try to get him back on the same end. 
[03:44:30]  But on the other end, you have to realize that even though they're friends, Opie and E-Rock are not peers.  Opie and me, we're not peers, okay?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with employee Eric Nagel, employee Sam Roberts, you know what I mean?  You can't, if your boss does something to piss you off, you can't go out there and fight fire with fire.  You have to figure out what your course of action is. 
[03:45:00]  I would assume that E-Rock is going to take some time to think about this.  Hopefully, he will talk to Opie, and Opie will be able to plead his case.  And I think the only recourse, because you're not going to be able to do something where you, you know, out Opie with something.  And plus, why would you want to?  I think the only recourse is cold, hard cash and lots of it.  I think E-Rock has got to milk this cow right now.  There's a lot of money on the table, and E-Rock's got to take every dime he can.  I know he doesn't need it, but who doesn't want it?  You know what I mean?  If it was up to me, I'd be like, no, Opie, I'm very upset right now. 
[03:45:30]  And as I said on the show today, start letting him know how much a new cell phone is going to cost.  And start talking, maybe inflate the value of the vacation a little bit that Opie offered to pay for.  You know, try to get every dollar you can.  I think that's the only way that any of this is going to work.  As I said, Dan Soder is on his way back in.  He had to take a shit.  He told me as we were waiting for the show to come on that he was asking me if I smelled his farts, and I did not. 
[03:46:00]  But because he had been farting a bunch because he felt like he was going to shit himself.  So he's freeing his bowels.  He will join us in just a moment.  In the meantime, it's Diversity Day here at SiriusXM, so everybody's very excited, I think.  Have you seen the signs?  There's big signs everywhere that say Diversity Day at SiriusXM.  And I guess there's instructions.  You get to go downstairs and hang out with people of different cultures.  But the thing about these signs is it says Diversity Day at SiriusXM. 
[03:46:30]  And then in the same size font, it says Refreshments.  So people are going, well, we know that people are not just going to show up to Diversity Day to hang out with people.  We know that we can't just have a day where everybody accepts everybody else's cultures and beliefs.  However, however, if we include some free food on this, then maybe, just maybe, we can make a difference.  Roland, have you noticed the Diversity Day posters all over the walls?  Yeah, it's going to be shit food. 
[03:47:00]  Exactly.  You weren't listening to the show, correct?  No, I was just saying.  The whole thing with Diversity Day is they had to make the word refreshments as big as the word's Diversity Day.  Because nobody's showing up without refreshments.  They might as well have wrote the word cheap in the bottom as fuck.  So you're not sitting there going to yourself, maybe I should go and maybe I should get an increased knowledge of other people's cultures.  You're going, I doubt the refreshments will be any good at all.  Not only that, the food is going to be awful. 
[03:47:30]  Not only that, but the food is going to be awful.  Well, 774, you're on the show.  Hey, I think you're right.  Eric should milk this thing instead of bean milk.  I get it.  A little cow joke, a little cow joke.  Never hurt anybody.  Thanks.  Thanks, E-Roxover, ever.  Thanks, buddy.  But yeah, so you're not going to go down to Diversity Day.  No, no.  For what?  I guess the refreshments.  That's what they're counting on.  Would you like to take the poo-poo platter that tastes like shit?  No, yeah, mmm, good. 
[03:48:00]  Now, did you say poo-poo platter tastes like shit because you wanted a little wordplay?  Oh, no.  Or do you think they're actually getting poo-poo platters?  Well, it's called poo-poo platter.  I've heard the phrase poo-poo platter.  I just find it very difficult to believe that the poo-poo platter is what Sirius XM...  It's going to be delicious if it's made right.  I don't think that that's what they're supplying for Diversity Day is poo-poo platters.  No.  But what do we do?  Ooh, we have Diasprite.  Get the fuck out of here.  Maybe they'll have different foods for different cultures.  Just give us Dr. Pepper and leave us alone.  We'll be happy.  I wish they had Dr. Pepper here for free. 
[03:48:30]  I know.  They have awful selection.  Same shit.  Your mouth is full of chips, Roland.  It's delicious, though.  You love food days.  I love food days.  We have free tacos in the studio, and Roland is just having a ball.  Except the boss is listening.  It happened.  You did.  You got a little bit of a tough time for Taco Day?  Yeah.  How'd you feel?  Tim sent out an email.  Last night, Roland says, okay, Taco Day is canceled.  Tim sends out this email.  Or Anthony responds to the email.  WTF.  Sarcastically. 
[03:49:00]  Obviously sarcastically.  Saying, WTF, what a bummer, dude.  And then Roland, you are stuck.  Finding tacos.  Because Tim then replies and says, you got to find these tacos, dude.  Do you have to work for them?  You have no idea.  Dan Soder, back in the house.  In the heezy is what we say here on the show.  Oh, no.  We don't ever.  Please don't.  I've never said that before.  Please don't ever say that you said that.  We would just be on Eric's home address.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We just figured we'd give out E-Rock's social security number. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  Just by mistake.  As an accident.  I can't hear out of this.  Did you see the Diversity Day posters as you went to the bathroom?  No, I didn't.  Yeah, it's Diversity Day.  What did I miss?  Well, I don't know because I didn't read the whole flyer except as big.  It says Diversity Day, right?  And in a font that is equally as big, it says under it, refreshments.  Which means this is how bad radio is.  Remember we were talking about free food and how radio people just love?  The only way they can convince anyone to go to a Diversity Day is if they go, radio people, 
[03:50:00]  there's free food downstairs.  Guys, we have soft drinks.  Yeah.  Come learn about different races that you work with.  There's carbonated beverages.  Dude, those tacos were fucking unbelievable.  We were just talking about them.  And the worst thing when you have to poop.  Oh, so you just ate them, though.  How could they have traveled through your system that quickly?  It does it to me, too.  I had to poop before.  Oh, gosh.  And then tacos were brought.  And then you're not going to not eat tacos.  No, of course not. 
[03:50:30]  So I just ate tacos knowing.  I was just like, I'm just going to do it.  I'm just going to eat tacos even though I have to poop.  And nothing bad happened.  So there you go.  Well, I mean, you had to run and poop real quick.  Yeah, in between the break.  But I had to hold it like nothing.  I was like, eh.  And I would assume listening to Scott and Todd audio did not help anything.  No.  It was almost pushing it out faster.  Exactly.  I love the shrimp tacos.  What'd you have?  I had all three of those tacos.  Oh, okay.  What helped the poop most, do you think? 
[03:51:00]  The pineapple ones.  That's what did it.  A little spice.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you got to light the colon walls on fire a little bit.  Just push everything out.  Yeah, strike a match.  Yeah.  And then it gets real.  That's good.  It was funny because I wanted to tell her, like, I worked at a Mexican restaurant in New  York for so long.  And, like, it just, like, seeing those tacos just brought me back.  Was it a real Mexican restaurant?  That was kind of like a...  It wasn't, like, authentic?  No.  No.  No.  I was one of the waiters.  How authentic is a Mexican restaurant if I'm bringing you your food? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  Just your height alone should put you off the spectrum for possible Mexican waiters.  Yeah, me walking up here, like, I'm not...  There's no...  You could tell there's...  It's what we got there!  It's what we got there!  Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  They're like, who's this giant gringo?  Yeah.  See, if you walked up to my table, I just got up and left.  I'm like, this is going to be a shithole.  You would.  Two seconds.  Yeah.  It's a bougie...  You know, it's kind of a chain now, I guess.  It's not really a chain.  What is it?  I don't know.  I don't like publicizing the restaurant that I worked at. 
[03:52:00]  I worked at Dos Caminos.  That was quick.  Yeah.  I really got it out of you.  Because at first, I'm like, who gives a shit?  Yeah.  I don't want to give them any publicity.  No.  I don't want to put my name behind them.  Oh, I'm not putting my name behind it.  That's okay.  Did you have a good time working there?  No.  It was horrible.  It was the fucking worst.  What was the kitchen like?  I always ask people who work in restaurants about these kitchens.  Clean.  Very clean.  What about the people who worked in the kitchen?  They were awesome.  I liked them better than the front of house.  They weren't dropping logs in food and stuff like that? 
[03:52:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They took their job real seriously, but they...  They were way cooler.  They'd give me food and stuff, and they don't give you food at this restaurant.  Most restaurants I've worked at, you get to eat some of the food.  Of course.  They give you the gruel.  They give you staff meal, and they're like, you just eat your slop.  There's a separate staff meal?  Yeah.  And it was gross.  It was just the worst part of the chicken.  But the people in the back, they were actual Mexican people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were legit.  So they looked at you like, I've never seen anything like this before.  A six-foot-however-many-white man? 
[03:53:00]  Oh, they called me...  Yeah, they called me gringo loco.  They did?  Yeah, because they're just like...  Because I would lose my shit, because I don't like...  Waiting tables...  Waiting tables sucks, because you just have to take everyone's bullshit.  And I'm not good at that.  So, like, you know, all these businessmen would be like, excuse me, I ordered my quesadilla  over 15 minutes ago.  And then I'd go in the back of the kitchen and just scream about how much I fucking hated  these people.  So the cooks loved me.  Right.  Because they're just like, oh, yeah, we hate whites, too. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  Because they don't want some white guy coming back going, guys, table four has been waiting  for 15 minutes.  Guys, they got a four-top at 142.  And I put in their order.  It's a red ticket time.  That's a secret.  You're just going back to the kitchen going, these fucking white people.  All of them.  They love it.  The good part is that part of the people thought that you were yelling at them.  Yeah.  Yeah, they just heard screaming.  Like, all right.  There's this big, freakishly bassy screaming.  Who's Andre screaming at?  That's all they hear through the walls?  Yeah.  We couldn't hear. 
[03:54:00]  You were just yelling slurs about white people.  I'd be like, these white, evil motherfuckers.  These fucking crackers.  They're controlling everything.  Yeah.  And they love it.  Because most of the time, it's like, you know, like a theater major that's working there.  And they're just like, oh, excuse me.  Where are those chacos?  And I'm like, I don't like you at all.  Right.  I'm back there like, fuck, white people.  Right.  And he's like, si, yes, yes, I like him.  He's big.  Oh, yes.  He's big and angry.  Gringo logo.  Me gusta. 
[03:54:30]  Me gusta gringo logo.  A grande gringo logo.  He's so big.  You know they talk about you to their family nonstop.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no, he don't like white people.  There are white people who don't like other white people.  Fantastico.  Ay, ay, ay, ay.  Did you learn any Spanish?  I know, like, kitchen Spanish, you know.  Good.  That's the way to do it.  You go through school and you take, like, Spanish classes.  I don't know.  You don't learn a thing.  Like, you go, if you go through four years of high school Spanish, and even if you go into college, 
[03:55:00]  and you take Spanish, and you know the language from your classes, and you go out and do a kitchen,  you won't be able to communicate.  The thing that I learned that they loved the most is when I'd walk back there and be like,  pinche gringos.  Like, they think it's so funny.  It's pinching everything.  Yeah, but, like, they love that a white guy is saying that.  Right.  Like, see?  Yeah, fuck.  Well, I mean, I guess that's, when you're working at a restaurant like that, that's when  you give up and you realize, my race is the wrong one. 
[03:55:30]  I've been on the wrong team this whole time.  Yeah, I mean, you really, you feel about how, like, you see how terrible white people  are.  Yeah.  When you, you know, like, I'd watch, like, how the dishwashers would be treated.  These are dudes that work.  Mexican dudes.  No, these are, like, Africans most of the time.  Oh, okay.  They're, like, Western Africans.  So, is that how it breaks down?  It goes African dishwashers, Mexican cooks, white people in front.  Front of house is usually, like, white people that are, like, you know, most of the time  they're, like, struggling actors or something where they're, like, they can present things 
[03:56:00]  well.  The one escaped Mexican.  Yeah.  And then there's, like, yeah, the one white enough Mexican who's like, all right, you were  born in Sacramento.  Right, exactly.  Like, he didn't speak a word in Spanish.  You are not that Mexican.  He just, he's tan.  Yeah.  He's like, Rodrigo is half Irish.  Right.  But then what's funny is, like, you watch how the dishwashers, like, how the other waiters  would treat the dishwashers.  And you're like, these are just, like, they were my favorite people.  Oh, so.  But whatever.  But is it one of those things where the shit rolls downhill? 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  Like, the waiters are, like, whoever these shitty assistant managers are shitting all over  the waiters.  Let me tell you something, I am friends, like, some of the managers I had at the restaurant,  I'm close friends with, and I'm still friends with to this day, but they're a majority of  the managers that we went through, they're just the biggest psychotic pieces of shit.  Right.  Because they're just.  Because really, like, the idea is I'm an assistant manager or a manager at a restaurant, so that's  like a real career, right?  But it's not.  No.  It's one step above waiting tables. 
[03:57:00]  Like, you still have made nothing of yourself.  You don't even get the cash the waiters get.  No.  You don't get to leave it on the floor.  Right.  Exactly.  You get to do paperwork.  Right.  You're out on the floor, you work for your shit, and you go home with a pocket full of  cash.  And that's what I did.  I just waited tables during the day and did stand-up at night, and it was fucking brutal.  So you were one of those aspiring actor entertainers slash waiters.  I would never admit it.  You wouldn't?  No.  Fuck no.  I wouldn't give those people something. 
[03:57:30]  I wouldn't give them a leg to stand on.  Because that's what people do, and you can always tell the people they're going to fail.  Are the people that are like waiters, and they've been doing comedy for six months or  something, and they go, well, I mean, actually, I'm a comedian, but I just do this to-  No, no, no.  Never.  Never.  Never.  My line used to be when people, because asshole businessmen, I was in Midtown, so these businessmen  would come in and think they're clever.  And it sucks to see someone that thinks they're funny, and you have to wait on them.  You're like these just fucking dumb finance assholes that think they're so funny, and 
[03:58:00]  you're like, you're just, you're evil.  You're just pure white evil.  Like all your, all these laughs that you're getting are at the expense of somebody who  you just feel superior to because you're an evil white man.  That's exactly what it is.  Because you're a white man with money.  Oh, they just, they're like, hey, watch this.  Hey, check this one out, Chance.  Or like whatever their fucking dumb co-workers is Chance.  And they walk over and they're like, excuse me, uh, you call this a frozen margarita?  Because it's more like a lukewarm margarita.  And they're like, oh, good one, Bryson. 
[03:58:30]  And then I have to go.  Somebody send Carlito out here, huh?  Excuse me.  And then they wave you over while you're at another table, and you're like, you cocksucker,  I'm at work right now.  Oh, I didn't play with the snaps.  But the best one, they'd always be like, let me guess, you're an aspiring actor.  They'd always like, first off, if I was, fuck you, you dick.  Let me guess, you're raping the middle class.  Right.  Can I just guess that?  I'm going to go ahead and assume that either your boss had sex with you. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  Or your dad got you the job.  Oh, dad got, let me guess, your dad got you the job?  Because mine's dead.  Right.  And you just make it weird.  Right.  But then I'd always be like, when they're like, oh, it's fine.  And he's like, my dad, my dad didn't give me the job, but I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Hey, man, uh, here's the 30%.  Oh my God, done.  Nice tip.  But the best one, they'd be like, what are you, an aspiring actor?  And I'd just be like, no, I'm an aspiring waiter.  I was like, first it's this, then it's the Russian tea room, if I'm lucky.  And they'd be like, oh, seriously, what are you doing?  I'd be like, I'm a waiter.  I wait.  And I'd just sit in it. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  I'd just sit in the silence.  I'd be like, I'm a waiter.  I don't understand what you're talking about.  I have no aspirations beyond what you're seeing here.  Yeah.  This is it.  What if this is it?  Yeah.  What if it is?  You fucking asshole.  What if this is just what I do?  What are your aspirations, buddy?  What are your dreams?  You sit at home when you were a little kid.  When you were a little kid and you were watching TV and you were playing with G.I.  Joes and you were eating chicken nuggets and drinking Kool-Aid.  You were running around outside.  Were you sitting there dreaming of one day getting to wear a tie to work?  Or having a green Amex that your fucking company gave you and now you throw it around 
[04:00:00]  like you got Jesus dick.  Yeah.  I don't even know what that means, but fuck them.  Jesus had a massive dick.  Huge dick.  Look at the cross.  He's packing.  Yeah.  It's always those guys, though.  It's always those guys that think they're so fucking superior because they crunch numbers  all day.  You're a number jockey.  I like you break it down to them and you're like, this isn't what you wanted to do, dude.  I know you have money.  This isn't what you wanted to do, bro.  That would have been great to get in one of their heads and start whispering.  Yeah.  Huh?  Is this what happens when you go to your apartment?  Huh?  Yeah.  In the financial district.  You got that nice apartment on Gold Street. 
[04:00:30]  You like it.  You just feel it breathing down your neck.  Yeah.  Knowing that you just have to go and punch numbers the next day.  Fuck you.  All those people, all those aspiring people you make fun of.  Why do you make fun of them?  Do you make fun of them because they're doing what you didn't?  Because you never took a shot.  You didn't, did you?  Is it?  You didn't take a shot, did you?  You didn't take a shot.  I don't take a shot, man.  The best is-  I just want to lukewarm, Magali.  The best would be the people that would, it's the foreign tourists that would just come 
[04:01:00]  and not tip you.  Yeah.  None of them.  And they're all faking it.  And I'll tell you this, and like, some people are like, this could be, this might sound xenophobic  and racist.  If it is, fuck you.  It's true.  But you know what?  You just spent the first part of the story talking about how bad white people are.  So now you can be xenophobic and it'll even, it'll even everything out.  Fuck Spaniards.  Okay.  Okay.  Rich Spaniards.  This is not Hispanic people.  These are people from Spain.  Spain.  Yes.  Espanya.  Yes.  As they say to you. 
[04:01:30]  I didn't know.  When you walk up to the table and you go, hey, how you guys doing?  They're like, speak Spanish.  I had a lady say that to me.  I go, no, speak English.  She goes, I don't know.  And I was like, well, then we have ourselves a little bit of a crosswalk.  Well, it looks like we're at a deadlock.  Well, it looks like we're going to have to decide who's going to move first.  Lady, this is why the government shut down.  Okay.  So you're the Republicans.  I'm the Democrats.  Yeah.  And we're not going to, it was always so fascinating to me when people would do that.  We'd be like, speak Spanish.  And I'm like, no.  Absolutely not.  I used to. 
[04:02:00]  Point to what you want on this menu.  Just point.  I used to be so difficult to foreign tourists that wouldn't speak English that when they would  leave because they were so frustrated with me, I'd get the other waiters in my head  to do a defense chant.  We'd go, defense, defense.  Because you knew going in that they weren't going to tip anyway?  They're not going to tip you.  They're just, they don't do that.  Is that a thing where foreigners just don't tip?  Or is it a thing where they come to America knowing that they don't have to tip because  they'll assume, because we'll assume that it's because they're foreign? 
[04:02:30]  It's a mixture of both.  It's a mixture of some, some tourists are just so uninformed that they don't know that  you're supposed to tip here and that waiters live off here.  And then there are the ones that know exactly what the fuck they're doing.  And you can tell with the way they look at you because they look at you like, what's  up?  Pick that, pick that plate up.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not going to tip you.  Bend over.  Take it.  Indian people do not tip.  Just straight up.  And is that, uh, and that's out of principle you think?  I don't know.  I used to get so mad about it because they make their orders so complicated because most 
[04:03:00]  of the time they're vegetarian.  So they come in and they're like, what I want you to do is take the steak burrito, remove  all traces of steak.  I want you to make a new filling and I want you to bring it to me in three minutes as fast  as possible.  I'm not going to give you any money.  One of the best times?  Because, you know, when you're waiting tables, most of the time tables over like eight, you  get to do automatic gratuity.  So sometimes you were like, they'd be like, you know, they'd tell you like, Dan, you got 
[04:03:30]  a seven top coming in.  I'd be like, all right, sweet.  Hopefully this is a bunch of drinkers.  Yeah.  And they tip me well.  And one time I was in the kitchen, like, you got a seven top and I walk in and it's  Indians and I pulled the Indiana Jones.  I was like, Indians.  It had to be Indians.  Because they're looking at me like, we are going to make you work as hard as possible.  And quickly too.  Quickly too.  Barely, barely, quickly.  I don't want my tacos to be in the same room as beef as any meat.  Oh, it was fucking those five years. 
[04:04:00]  We got to go.  That's it?  That's it.  I got shut down.  Dan Soder is going to be at the Stress Factory this weekend.  This weekend.  So check him out.  Tonight and tomorrow night.  It's at Dan Soder on Twitter and DanSoder.com and Dan.Soder on Facebook, which is lame.  I don't know why I have that.  It sucks.  Well, I'm sorry.  Maybe fucking help me change that.  I don't know, but it's a dot.  A dot.  No, do you forget the dot?  Just add the dot.  Yeah.  Just over someone's shoulder.  Let's put the dot.  Pinche.  Yeah.
