<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts complaining about their overcrowded studio due to the impending arrival of the band Jet for an in-studio performance.  They moved quickly to discuss the top Google Trends, highlighting “Rev Al is a racist” (number one), fueled by their criticism of Al Sharpton’s eulogy at Michael Jackson’s memorial service, which they characterized as hypocritical and racist, comparing Sharpton’s speaking style to that of a bullfighter.  Number fourteen, “Corey Feldman is hurting,” was attributed to misspellings.  The hosts dissected Bill O’Reilly’s interview with Sharpton, focusing on Sharpton’s evasive answers regarding questions about Michael Jackson’s alleged child molestation, his acquittal, a significant financial settlement, and unusual behavior with children.  They criticized O'Reilly's inability to effectively challenge Sharpton, citing O'Reilly's own past settlements.  A caller shared morbid details about Jackson’s post-mortem condition from a supposed friend in the coroner’s office, contradicting information provided by Jackson's dermatologist on Larry King Live concerning lupus, scarring from a Pepsi accident, and skin expansion surgery.  Multiple callers offered opinions on Sharpton and Jackson, with one caller mentioning a news story about a swim club allegedly refusing entry to Black children. Another caller described their experience with tissue expander surgery.  The show continued with further analysis of Sharpton’s performance in the O’Reilly interview, debunking Sharpton’s claims about Jackson being the first Black artist on *Rolling Stone* and MTV.


The show continued with a hypothetical scenario involving a detective and a bomb, segueing into a discussion of Prince and Michael Jackson’s music videos on MTV and the portrayal of Black artists in early *Rolling Stone*.  The conversation then veered to National Enquirer reports about Jackson’s alleged pill use and sexuality, followed by a humorous segment focusing on the ubiquitous and annoying Shinedown song “Second Chance” playing repeatedly in the Sirius XM bathroom.  This transitioned into a graphic discussion about the appalling cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the Sirius XM bathrooms, detailing instances of feces and urine in unexpected locations, prompting numerous calls recounting similar shocking bathroom experiences from their own workplaces, including anecdotes of booger-smeared walls and snot rockets.  This led to a discussion of graphic internet images. The conversation then abruptly shifted to the murder-suicide of Steve McNair and his girlfriend, where the hosts speculated about the girlfriend's motives, the wife's knowledge of the affair, and the crime scene details. The segment included tangents about a listener's account of a snot-rocket exchange between motorcycle club members, “white wall” tires, and a caller who fired a handgun during the broadcast; also discussions on clapping songs, Michael Jackson’s dance skills, and Anthony Cumia’s modified car.


A caller described his new Shelby GT500 Super Snake, detailing its speed, acceleration, and fuel consumption.  The discussion encompassed the car’s features and the thrill of driving a manual transmission, including the challenges of doing so while holding coffee. The show then covered a prank played on an intern, Pierce, who was tricked into believing Megan Fox was visiting, leading to a “Backstage with Ona” segment detailing his disappointment.  The conversation moved to the Google bomb targeting “Cory Feldman is hurting,” including excerpts from Feldman’s online statement and a new book detailing allegations against Michael Jackson.  The final major topic was a news story about a worker who died after falling into a vat of melted chocolate, prompting dark humor and speculation from the hosts and callers. A caller’s segment about this death had significant audio issues.


This segment began with a bizarre, heavily punctuated bit about the chocolate vat death, including numerous offensive candy-related puns. Callers shared more “silly death” stories, one involving a man who drowned after a bee attack. The hosts then discussed a YouTube video of Japanese hornets attacking a beehive.  Opie detailed a severe allergic reaction from bee stings, resulting in significant skin peeling from his scrotum.  Listener calls recounted similar experiences.  The segment concluded with an in-studio interview with the band Jet, covering their career, music promotion (including social media), fan experiences (including unusual encounters in Japan), and their touring schedule, interspersed with two acoustic performances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  There we go. Volume. Nice.  We're very, uh, we're very crowded today.  Yeah. Why is that?  I just wish SiriusXM would have, uh, listened to us.  Yeah.  We need a bigger space.  We're gonna have a band come in today. 
[00:00:30]  And, uh, Jet.  They got some new stuff to play for us today.  And when they bring in their equipment, we can't even move in here.  Yeah, it really is.  Why do they think this is a good idea, a good studio for us?  Claustrophobic.  If we're trying to get things done.  Claustrophobic.  Don't you feel kind of uncomfortable because there's so much stuff in here today?  Yeah.  It's insane.  And poor Mars is just, he's doing things and talking to himself in the corner.  Yeah.  It's like wires and just, and then I kind of, I put this on. 
[00:01:00]  Who could, what the?  And we officially can't have anyone else in studio today.  None of our guys.  No.  If any of the Uber fans are stopping by, we can't have you today.  There's nowhere to put you.  I know.  There's literally no room in this joint.  But we will be professional broadcasters and do our best like we do every morning.  We will rise above.  They're calling us the Google Bomb Kings.  What can I tell you?  But it is the truth. 
[00:01:30]  Well, that's true.  We invented the Google Bomb.  Google Bomb.  Other people are attempting to Google Bomb, but we invented it.  Google.  A while ago.  The Google.  And what is the number one Google right now, Danny?  Our number one Google trend is Rev Al is a racist.  That would be something we started yesterday, which has taken on a life of its own.  We hit on something with the Rev Al is a racist thing.  Yes.  Because other people are also questioning, you know, his racism.  You just got to throw it out there.  And then people start thinking, hey, wait a minute. 
[00:02:00]  I guess he is.  This one's stuck because a lot of people are questioning what the F was Rev Al talking  about at that Michael Jackson Memorial.  Yeah.  So Rev Al is a racist.  Number one on the Google trends.  And well, it should be.  More importantly, number 14 is Corey Feldman is hurting.  That's number 14?  Number 14 right now, but still climbing the Google charts.  What's just beating?  I think the only reason Corey Feldman is hurting is not number one is because a lot of people 
[00:02:30]  had a tough time spelling Corey and Feldman.  Yeah.  Corey is weird.  There's a few different spellings people could use there.  And then Feldman.  What's the proper spelling?  I don't know if it's men, Feldman.  C-O-R-E-Y?  Yeah.  I would assume.  E-Y?  F-E-L-D-M-A-N?  Yeah.  And they were probably doing M-E-N.  Sure.  So there you are.  F-E-L-D-M-A-N.  I want to know who's just edging out poor, hurting Corey Feldman.  Well, Corey Feldman is hurting.  I mean, you know, it's still too new to him. 
[00:03:00]  What's the number 13?  13 is Anita Lowe, but I have no idea who or what that is.  All right.  Let's...  Who gives a crap?  Anita.  All that matters is Corey Feldman is hurting, and we're here to try to help him heal.  Got to help him.  Got to help him.  Chef.  He's still having trouble getting through this tough, tough time.  This very, very tough time.  Very tough.  Jimmy, you think he has another Michael Jackson outfit, or is he wearing the same one?  He's probably got a couple different ones.  I bet he has a couple different hats and a couple different colored jackets and somber sunglasses. 
[00:03:30]  He's doing the whole thing with the shoes and the dancing and tipping the hat and putting his hand up.  You think he's going through his dry cleaner and saying, look, put a rush on this one because I'm going to need this back soon.  I'm going to need this one by the weekend.  I got an event.  Yeah, this story is going to die out.  I need to get in that limelight.  And he probably has seen the Google Trends say, the world is with me.  I'm hurting.  They understand that I'm hurting.  I'm hurting.  You okay, buddy? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think he's been taking phone calls all day.  Yeah, yeah, you know, I'm okay.  All right, I saw you in the paper.  Just up like your old friend there.  Put a rush on this, could you?  Please.  Hurting.  Yeah.  I'm hurting.  I haven't worn this since I was 11.  It's got some what looks like tapioca on the back of it.  Oh, boy.  Well, a lot of people tweeting me saying, man, Al Sharpton's about to go head-to-head with Bill O'Reilly. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  And, man, I'm not a big fan of Bill O'Reilly.  And just so you know where I stand, I'm not a fan of Keith Overman either.  I'm actually kind of a fan of Sean Hannity, even though I don't really agree with him politically.  Yeah.  But he seems to be more of a real guy on that TV than the two I just mentioned.  I don't like O'Reilly because I think he says stuff that he absolutely doesn't believe in just so people go, wow, I didn't expect that out of O'Reilly. 
[00:05:00]  Like, he'll side with a liberal on a certain issue just to go like, see, look at me, fair and balanced.  And you decide.  No spin zone.  No spin zone, please.  And then you're like, you know, just yesterday I heard you railing on this subject.  Right.  And then he gets someone in the studio there to interview, and he changes his tune.  And I think it's just to freak the audience out. 
[00:05:30]  It keeps him guessing and going like, what?  I kind of agree with you.  Yesterday when he had Reverend Al on, all I could think of was the fact that he wanted to call Reverend Al some horrendous names.  Oh, you mean that one?  I think he throws some shit around when he's not on TV, my friend.  Sure.  It's my humble opinion.  It's Irish.  Huh?  It's Irish from Long Island?  Yeah.  But so, I don't know.  I was disappointed with the big showdown, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  You kind of said it about Reverend Al. 
[00:06:00]  He knows how to, like, weasel his way out of, like, tough situations when he's put on the spot.  He doesn't really ever answer a question.  No.  He answers your question by asking other questions.  Other questions.  That he needs answers to.  Laughing it off like it's nothing.  Oh, he crushes the major stuff right aside.  Like, oh, you're silly for even asking that.  Here's what it's about.  Right.  And it's like, no, I didn't ask you your opinion of what something's about.  I asked you a direct question on an event or a statement you made or your history, and 
[00:06:30]  he does not answer those things.  He will not answer them.  He's like a bullfighter.  Yeah.  He's got the big, what do they call that thing?  Oh, the big friggin'.  The red thing.  The cape.  Yeah, let's call it the red cape.  The big cape thing.  And then he, like, does a little move, and the bull is, like, past him.  But the problem is, Rev, the bull's still in the area.  Yeah.  And he's coming back.  And he's going to keep coming back.  He doesn't answer anything. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  You ask him about Tawana Brawley.  It's ancient history.  He blames other people for him being lied to.  And all he was doing was protecting a girl.  But the truth of the matter is, he knew.  He knew shit was not on the up and up with that whole thing.  Mm-hmm.  But, again, he deflects it.  Well, you know what?  Got to give him credit for that.  I mean, I don't wanna, but he skated. 
[00:07:30]  He kind of skated last night.  I don't Tawana.  I know.  Rev Owls a racist is making a lot of news articles today, too.  Yeah, yeah.  He is.  A lot of news articles.  People are really taking a look at his speech at the memorial.  Take a look at that speech, and then look at it through eyes that Larry King should have  plucked out, because Larry King gave him praise on his speech.  Oh, he sure did.  And the truth of the matter is, son of a bitch, it was the most racist, race-baiting, hate-filled, 
[00:08:00]  twisted, inappropriate speech I've ever seen anyone make in an event.  But, praising Michael Jackson like he's some kind of Martin Luther King.  Hitler's Nuremberg speech has had more tolerance.  It's just insane.  He skins his knee.  You skin your knee on the way to the top of the...  Shut up!  Yeah.  And he rose above the...  What?  Did he?  What did he say?  He out-sang his cynics. 
[00:08:30]  He, like, did SSDD.  SSDD, PP out-danced his doubters, out-performed his...  Shut up.  He just had incredible talent that everyone enjoyed.  He's trying so hard.  It doesn't matter what fucking color you were.  He's trying so hard to be that activist that has the rhymes and the three things.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you, Michael.  The three.  You got to have the three.  I'm an activist.  Repeat. 
[00:09:00]  Well, you want a taste of Al Sharpton on The O'Reilly Factor?  Yes, Opie!  Yes, Opie!  Yes, Opie!  I was on the edge of my seat, like my hands in the air.  You know when you watch boxing, you feel like you're kind of like...  Here we go.  You're like, no, go with the right.  Oh, oh, come on!  And I'm just sitting there with my hands up, not moving, because he...  God, O'Reilly!  I think O'Reilly was scared.  Ugh.  Because I started really deciphering the whole thing I was seeing. 
[00:09:30]  And I'm like, I think in the back of O'Reilly's head, he's like, man, I can't go where I want  to go, because this guy is a powerful dude.  And they like each other, I think.  And my bosses are scared of this guy.  I think they are asshole buddies.  I think they're friends, too, because he went to that restaurant with Al in Harlem.  Black people eat just like we do.  He couldn't believe it.  He's like, I thought they threw food around.  He loves it.  That was a great quote.  He loves it, because he can...  It gives him some latitude as far as talking about black issues, because then he could 
[00:10:00]  have Reverend Al on, kiss his ass a little bit, and get out of trouble.  There you go.  Here's a taste.  And with us now is Reverend Sharpton.  Nothing strange about Michael Jackson?  Yeah, this was after he played the, there was nothing strange about your father.  It was strange what they did, or what he had to deal with, or whatever it was.  Yeah, what he had to deal with was strange.  Oh, really?  What did he have to do?  All that plastic surgery, altering his face and all of that, the hundreds of thousands of  dollars spent on prescription drugs, in vitro, on white kids, you know, when you're a black 
[00:10:30]  man.  Nothing strange about him?  Well, no.  I think, first of all, you could probably have a large percentage of Americans that  have had plastic surgery.  Not like that.  Well, maybe he had more resources.  Maybe a lot of this is exaggerated.  Let's deal with the issue.  The issue is...  Let's deal with the issue.  The issue was just Bill's question.  Right.  Is that strange? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Well, O'Reilly also...  Is it strange?  He didn't say, maybe he should have, maybe he will mention, but he didn't mention that  the money paid out...  Right, right, right.  ...in Chablas.  Yeah, yeah.  He goes to all those areas, but you see what Reverend Al does?  Yeah.  Just like Anthony was saying yesterday.  That's a big question, and a tough question to answer.  What does Reverend Al say?  He brushes...  A lot of people have...  Brushes his side like the bullfighter.  Yeah.  Brushing that bull away and going, all right, this is what I want to get done here today.  I like that.  A lot of people in America, I believe, have had plastic surgery. 
[00:11:30]  Well, a lot of people that have are strange, too.  Some of them that, you know, you got a big schnoz, you get a nose job.  That's not strange.  You know, you're unhappy with a certain aspect of the way you look and you have a plastic  surgery.  That's not strange.  You look at something like that Wildenstein woman.  Oh, my God.  That's fucking strange.  You look at other women that walk around the Upper West Side of Manhattan with those giant  duck-bill fucking platypus lips and collagen foreheads and their ears are a staple behind 
[00:12:00]  their head from facelifts.  That's strange.  And Michael Jackson, that's strange.  You can't put all plastic surgery in one...  Oh, look at that.  Thank you, Danny.  What a freak of fucking nature that is.  There is a woman, you nailed it on the Upper West Side, that is starting to look very similar  to that.  Wow.  And I've been attempting to get video of her, but I'm too scared.  Oh, just take it.  Because I'm too scared. 
[00:12:30]  For real.  I'm not even going to front.  I'm scared of this woman that I see walking around.  Just take the video.  I'm trying it.  She walks her dog every day and her lips are...  I can't even explain them.  It's fantastic.  How huge and puffy they are.  Ridiculously over-the-top puffy.  That's strange.  And her eyes don't move.  And she's got these big puffy cheeks that go large.  What happened to her?  That lady had some plastic surgery, I think.  Back to Reverend Al.  Yeah, people don't get it. 
[00:13:00]  That it is totally irresponsible for a lawmaker to disregard the law.  Charges were made against Michael Jackson.  A mostly non-black jury.  He talks about nine out of ten.  Let's try twelve out of twelve.  And a jury said he was not guilty of child molestation.  That's all.  See, he deflected and went after Peter King, who Bill O'Reilly had on first.  Obviously, Bill O'Reilly wanted to have these guys go head-to-head. 
[00:13:30]  But I would imagine that Peter King's like, I'm not going to acknowledge this guy.  If you want to talk to me separately, that's fine.  What a load of shit, too.  All right, he was acquitted.  So was O.J.  And we know O.J. killed two people.  So what does that mean?  And then what about the payoff?  You know, there was another trial or more allegations against him.  And he decided to pay 15 mil on that one.  Reverend Al.  And what a deflection. 
[00:14:00]  That question was, do you believe he's strange?  Because of the odd things he did with himself and the odd way he acted.  And Reverend Al just didn't answer it.  Answer the fucking question.  This is what I had a deal with last night.  With my hands in the air, getting ready to box.  Shadow box.  I'm like, come on.  Nothing.  Reverend Al bobs and weaves.  He was bobbing and weaving.  Can't connect on him.  He sure was bobbing and weaving.  And just because the jury convicted him, sorry, acquitted him, he paid out that money. 
[00:14:30]  You can't deny that he paid out that kind of money.  That's not a small settlement just to divert legal fees.  No, no, no.  That's $15.3 million.  It was way beyond.  If that's what he paid, that goes way beyond just avoiding legal fees.  And he admitted he slept in the same bed with children.  Oh, Riley asks Sharpton about that very thing.  He does, does he?  But let's keep our scorecard going here.  So Reverend Al has so far answered no questions.  0 for 1 in answering of the questions. 
[00:15:00]  But how do you describe an adult male, single, admittedly bringing young children into his  bed to sleep with them?  What I don't describe it is something that a jury has already said it was not.  But how do you describe it?  Whether I say Michael had arrested development, whether I said Michael dealt with children  in different ways or not, it's immaterial.  We're talking about a person that votes on laws saying, I don't care what a jury says, 
[00:15:30]  I'm going to impose a criminal accusation anyway.  That's irresponsible.  You're bringing a very narrow standard to the definition of Michael Jackson.  I'm addressing what he said.  I think Reverend Al is insane.  I mean, I understand he wants to defend the black man and black issues and all that, but  how far is he going to take it?  To the hilt.  Obviously.  That's why I think he's insane.  He will never back down.  This guy is just a race-baiting racist. 
[00:16:00]  Reverend Al, he has at least one daughter.  I think he has more than that.  I'm not really sure.  I remember the one daughter pouting and giving I'm his dirty looks as I'm his sat down and  talked to Reverend Al.  That would never happen on our show.  I'd say, leave your daughter outside, okay?  Well, let me see what's on her iPod.  Let's see exactly who she's listening to.  If there's any artist that's, say, bitch or hoe or any of that stuff, that's really  offending her.  Right, right, right.  But, I mean, so basically Reverend Al is saying he would have no problem with Michael Jackson 
[00:16:30]  sleeping with his own kids when they were young?  Apparently.  That's what he's basically saying, right?  Because another question that he's kind of just brushing off as the bullfighter just  lets the bull go by again.  Just arrested development.  I think Peter King was stupid, though.  I think what he said was fucking dumb.  Peter King is skating, my friend.  I'm not saying he's not.  I'm just saying what he said I thought was stupid.  But he should have phrased it slightly differently.  I think Peter King was right on, and God bless him for being honest. 
[00:17:00]  We need more honesty in this stupid world by our politicians, by our media guys, you know?  He took a big chance.  Peter King's not a dumb guy.  He knew exactly what he was saying.  He knew exactly what he was saying.  But he had it because he sees, like, all these more important issues going on in this country,  and the media spent, we're up to two weeks now, on around-the-clock Michael Jackson coverage. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  The world looks like it's going to blow up, but the media is more concerned about Michael Jackson,  what the fuck's going on.  Right.  And I hope we should, maybe O'Reilly does ask, but I would love him to ask,  are you going to tell me that you wouldn't have a problem if it was, say, a 40-something-year-old white man  who surrounded himself with black children and slept in a bed with them?  Are you going to tell me you wouldn't have some kind of problem with that?  Right, right.  Are you going to tell me you don't think that's strange?  The guy who wanted to buy the, we all know the stories.  I mean, come on.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just dishonest.  Yeah.  To say you don't think that's strange, unless you live in a similar situation. 
[00:18:00]  How could you not think that's strange?  I don't get it.  Yeah.  He picked the wrong person to go defend on this one.  This is crazy.  Even Michael Jackson's close friends are avoiding this whole thing.  Yeah.  They weren't at the memorial.  The list is growing of all the people that should have been there that weren't there.  Instead of just saying, yeah, you know, look, I'm in front of his children and his family,  and I'm speaking positively about Michael.  Does it matter if I say that your daddy's not straight?  Like, instead of just acknowledging, like, yeah, I said that because of his kids.  You're right. 
[00:18:30]  He should have just focused on Michael Jackson, the entertainer.  And I think a lot more people wouldn't have had a problem with what Reverend Al was saying  on that stage.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Reverend Al, let's not forget, also was standing next to that scumbag, Joe Jackson, as Joe Jackson  is announcing his new record label, literally the day or two days after Michael Jackson died.  Reverend Al decided he needed to be in that circle as well.  Yeah.  Okay?  Anyway, he attached himself to the wrong thing.  Yeah.  The wrong thing. 
[00:19:00]  If you want to praise him as an entertainer, go for it, man.  Go ahead.  No one can criticize that.  But to try to say that we are crazy for asking questions about Michael Jackson and what he did  over the last 15 to 20 years, 25 years, we can't sit here and say that.  That's crazy.  You know what I mean?  Anybody else would be a creepy guy.  Right.  Just a creepy guy to be hanging around with children that age, sleeping in the same bed and 
[00:19:30]  playing little games.  I mean, it's beyond this charitable thing that he's doing.  Yes, it is.  It's something, at least, at the very least, it's something bordering on this weird sexuality  thing that's going on.  It's inappropriate.  It's inappropriate.  It's never appropriate.  I can't think of a time where it'd be fucking appropriate to sleep with a bunch of kids  who aren't yours consistently.  Yeah.  Like, when the parents leave them at the house, it's just shitty. 
[00:20:00]  You know, by now, you know, I have a lot of nephews and nieces, and my brother's family  came over, and he has four kids, and, you know, we're having a really good time, and  one of his daughters decides she's tired and jumps in our really, I have a really nice  big bed, okay, where it could have easily been me, my girl, and the niece sleeping,  and it wouldn't have mattered in the least.  There's plenty of room for everybody, okay? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I was paranoid.  I said, fuck that, and I slept on the floor.  Of course.  I said, no way.  I can't do it, though.  Right.  Can't do that.  I was like, no, you know what?  I'll just sleep on the floor.  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to, where are we going today?  Let's say hi to Steve in Michigan.  Steve.  Hey, how's it going, O&A?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, I was listening to Shea Thomas yesterday, and he claims he's got a good friend of his  that works in the coroner's office there in Los Angeles, and his buddy was part of the 
[00:21:00]  autopsy team.  He said that the guy was completely hairless, including his head.  His hair on his head was a wig.  His whole body, including his genitals, was completely bleached white, and his nose was  a prosthetic.  Like, it did come off.  Come on.  Well, Jay Thomas is kind of, you know, exaggerating a little bit.  The guy said he wasn't trying to make a bit out of it.  No.  He was talking to Garrett, and he was saying he was being completely serious. 
[00:21:30]  You know, he says, I'm not making a bit out of this.  Well, Larry King's, Larry King had Michael Jackson's dermatologist on, the guy that was really  close to Michael Jackson for the last 25 years, the guy that a lot of people think is the  father of the two kids.  Yeah.  And he admitted last night that, yes, Michael Jackson had most of his hair gone.  Really?  From lupus, actually.  Last night, this doctor said on Larry King that the first time he met Michael Jackson, 
[00:22:00]  it was obvious that he had lupus and a really bad acne problem.  Lupus, huh?  And that he had some severe scarring from that Pepsi commercial gone bad.  Yeah.  Wow.  And that Michael Jackson was doing something.  I was a little confused, but there's something you do where you put something in your head,  and it expands the tissue so they could use that tissue to, you know, cut out scarring 
[00:22:30]  and stuff and then patch it up with the new skin that's growing.  Some kind of a bubble thing or an air thing.  Yeah, I've heard about that, and it makes, it, like, stretches the skin.  I think they put something under the skin, and then they, like, kind of pump it up a little  bit, and then what the skin does is slowly grow.  And this doctor last night said Michael Jackson was wearing a lot of hats because he had a  big, like, ball or balloon of skin under his hat.  Like one of those old Nike air pumps or something? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  And then, you know, then they would cut the new skin away and, you know, fix the scarring  on his head.  Oh, my God.  And this dermatologist last night said, I finally told Michael, enough, you know, enough  with that, because he was obsessed with doing that as well.  But the doctor did admit last night that Michael Jackson lost most of his hair.  Yeah.  Did not have his original hair.  There's people with balloon bumps under their head.  Thank you, Steve.  Yeah, I forgot the medical term for it, but basically... 
[00:23:30]  Balloon bump.  But it's a balloon.  They keep blowing up, and the skin grows around it, and it gives you more skin, and then you  use that skin to, you know, fix up your body, whatever's fucked up.  The medical term was disgusting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Maryland.  Jeremy.  Jeremy.  Jeremy.  All right.  We lost him.  Let's say hi to Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony.  Hey, you know what?  How did this piece of crap even get involved with Michael Jackson? 
[00:24:00]  Michael Jackson is not a New York story.  He's from the Chicago area, Gary, Indiana, and he lived in L.A.  So how is Weber now even involved in this, and why, if Jesse Jackson is the big guy in  Chicago, you know, why isn't he standing up and doing all this crap for everybody?  I, this piece of shit, he just likes to just call this crap, and I'm tired of him.  Well, first of all, Jesse Jackson was involved, but he can't really speak.  He never was a good speaker, but certainly in the last few years.  So Reverend Al is kind of, you know, speaking for Jesse Jackson and everybody else, and you 
[00:24:30]  know the reason.  We talk about it all the time on our show.  We're honest enough to tell you that Reverend Al's an opportunist, and he's just pumping  up his own status with everything.  His own agenda.  His own agenda.  He used Michael Jackson's memorial event to just push his own agenda of racial separatism  and hatred.  That's what he did.  He should want a kid that says Negro-ish man for hire or something like that, and go around 
[00:25:00]  flying around the world just taking care of Negro-ish.  No, you know what?  You know what?  If he did that, I would almost respect him.  He picks which ones he's going to go after, and it's usually the ones that have the most  media attention.  And he's phony about it, yeah.  He's totally phony about it.  The most media attention.  Is he going to be down there in Philly, you know, protesting the pool that wouldn't let  those black kids in?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  What an insane story for the year 2009.  I know.  Did you hear about this one, Jimmy? 
[00:25:30]  I didn't read it, but I heard about it.  They didn't want some kind of complexion to change or something.  They kicked a bunch of...  Where's the story, man?  Were the black kids, were they residents of the complex or whatever they were, the place  that they were allowed?  Were they being rambunctious?  Yeah, I'll have to find the story.  Was there a horse play in the pool?  Yes.  No horse play in the pool.  Were they bouncing a ball around or playing Marco Polo?  We have to have it in this pile, no?  I got to find it.  I'm sure we got it.  Yeah, basically...  Oh God. 
[00:26:00]  Another one of these.  I didn't expect to go here.  I want to know the details of this one, though.  All right.  Pool boots kids who might change the complexion.  Campers sent packing after first visit to swim club.  First visit, huh?  Wow.  Dimir Bailer, I think.  D-Y-M-I-R-E.  Says he overheard a woman ask,  what are all these black kids doing  when he and his friends showed up?  More than 60 campers from northeast Philadelphia  were turned away from a private swim club  and left to wonder if their race was the reason. 
[00:26:30]  Kids at Creative Steps Day Camp  were thrilled to go swimming once a week  at the Valley Swim Club,  but after one trip to the private club,  they were...  Dot, dot, dot.  I heard this lady.  She was like,  what are all these black kids doing here?  She's like,  I'm scared.  They might do something to my child,  said camper Dimir Bailer.  And that's the whole story?  There's more to it.  That's the version I got.  We'll have to get more details.  The change of complexion,  that's just the media creation.  Like, they don't know why,  because the private swim club, 
[00:27:00]  they don't know exactly why they said no yet.  Right.  They might have just been kicked out  because it was a private swim club.  And the media's just saying  that it was because they were black from Philadelphia.  Maybe they were a bunch of caddies.  Not allowed in the pool.  Look, see how we bring everything together?  We're calling it the balloon thing under the skin.  Yeah.  And we got Psycho Bob.  Remember him?  Of course I do.  Baltimore checking in.  What's up, Bob?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  The technical name for it  is called the Tissue Expander.  Tissue Expander. 
[00:27:30]  Very good.  Okay.  And that's it?  And basically what?  It's some kind of a balloon thing  that you put under the skin?  Yeah.  It's a fluid-filled balloon  that you inject over time.  You inject fluid and it expands.  And the skin actually stretches.  So what you can do then is  you cut out the bad skin  because the good skin has grown  and you've got enough of it  so you can pull it together.  How the fuck did you guys come up with that one?  That's pretty amazing.  That's a good one.  All right. 
[00:28:00]  Did you know that Michael Jackson  had that going on?  No.  No, that's the first I've heard of it.  Yeah.  Well, Larry King,  he did a pretty good job last night  with the dermatologist.  We learned a lot.  We'll get into some of that audio  a little later,  but thank you, Bob.  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's see.  Jesus, Danny.  And he's pulling up like  where they use that thing  to what?  Reconstruct breasts?  Yeah, apparently they use that.  They use that balloon thing 
[00:28:30]  to help, I guess,  breast cancer patients.  Yeah.  If you go searching out  this tissue expander,  you're going to get some  pretty disgusting results.  They pump it up.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  I'll tell you why O'Reilly  doesn't bring up that whole  settlement thing.  Because if you remember back  about two, three years ago,  he had a little settlement.  Oh, there you go.  Ring the bell.  Bravo.  There you go.  We got an answer. 
[00:29:00]  He can't bring it up  because Reverend Al  would turn around and go,  what about your settlement?  Uh-huh.  You settled something.  Does that make you  a sexual divin?  Were you guilty?  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  And that's really important  if you're talking to Reverend Al.  Now I know why I was sitting  on the edge of the couch  going, why isn't this  getting interesting?  That's why.  There you go.  That's the whole reason  why that interview  wasn't as good as it could be.  Why did he pay  to settle that kind of money? 
[00:29:30]  Come on.  God damn, Anthony.  Good job.  Good call, man.  That was it.  Thank you.  Let me say hi to Graham in PA.  Graham.  Hey, what's going on?  Love your crackers.  Thanks for weighing in.  Yeah, I got enough  for that in kindergarten.  All right.  That's great.  Anyway, I actually had  to get some of them  surgeries with the tissue expanders.  I got burnt real bad  when I was a little kid.  And when I got older,  I decided to look into,  like, you know, 
[00:30:00]  getting some corrective surgery.  And the doctor  put them tissue expanders  under my skin.  I had to have one  in my arms,  one of my chest  and one of my side.  And what they do  is they cut the skin  away from the muscle  and put the balloon  under there.  And it has, like,  a little valve  attached to it.  And they throw you back up  and let the stitching heal.  And then they fill up the balloon  and then they fill up the balloon  with saline solution. 
[00:30:30]  Old school.  They fill up the balloon  with saline solution  through a valve  under the skin.  And they actually have to  inject it with a needle.  And it was a pain in the ass.  It took three months  every surgery  to fill up the balloon  because the skin  has to stretch  real slowly.  Yeah, this takes forever,  by the way.  Do you have a big balloon  of skin hanging off  the side of your body?  Yeah, pretty much.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was pretty  nasty looking.  But, I mean, 
[00:31:00]  it took a lot of the scar out.  And I actually popped  a couple of the balloons  during a couple  of the surgeries.  Like, in between,  the one time  I had the one on my arm  and I went to pick up  the water jug  out of the refrigerator  and I flexed too hard  and the balloon  was filled up too much  and the shit  just popped under the skin.  Oh, God.  He's so muscular.  Yeah, it was pretty crazy.  Where'd you get burned?  Where was the scar in?  I got burnt  with boiling water  when I was, like, four.  Shit.  Would it fall  on your back  or something? 
[00:31:30]  No, I was trying  to check a pot of eggs  and I had to stand  up on a chair  and the chair, like,  busted  because we were broke  back then  and we trash-picked  a lot of our shit  and, like,  when I started  feeling myself  falling backwards,  I tensed up  and I forgot  to let go  of the spoon  which was still,  like, in the pot.  Oh, pot.  Yeah, and I ended up  yanking the shit  down on myself.  Oh, my God.  And, like,  I took my shirt off  because the water  was all soaked  in my shirt  and it was burning me  so I took that off 
[00:32:00]  and all my skin  just slid off  like on the white  side of my chest  and arm.  Mmm, tender.  Yeah, it was pretty rough.  All right, sir.  I'm glad you're doing  all right, Graham.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  All right, Dan.  Graham, you still there?  All right, Dan.  The one thing  I did want to ask,  you know,  you see these burn victims  and stuff  and it looks just horrific.  I want to know  how long  do you  fucking hurt?  It just looks like  it hurts forever.  Right.  Does the pain  ever go away?  Nerve endings  just sitting there  in the air. 
[00:32:30]  Let's go to  Colin, excuse me,  in VA.  Hey.  Colin.  You know.  Colin?  Yeah, I'm still here.  Hey.  All right, what's up?  Hey, I was just calling.  You mentioned before  about the racist  piece of shit  that I held  not so sharp  but O'Reilly  interviewed Peter King.  Before that,  he gave  Representative King  a chance  to backtrack  on his statement 
[00:33:00]  and not only  did he not backtrack,  he went ahead  and said that  he stood by  and he would  always stand by it.  Yeah, Peter King  had balls last night  because he did have  a chance to go,  all right,  well, maybe I was  a little harsh  and he said no.  No, he kept going, man.  I like that.  I really like that  in a person  because that's  kind of risky.  That could really hurt him.  It was fucking stupid  just because all you're doing  is inviting a lawsuit.  You got to be smart  when you're that.  The Jackson family  ain't going to sue Peter King.  You're probably right.  I think Peter King 
[00:33:30]  knew that.  Yep.  Maybe by suing him  they'd have to open up  the files  to prove that he said  something that was incorrect.  Yeah, right.  So yeah, that's  probably what it is.  Can I ask one more thing?  Yeah, that's probably what it is.  Yes, sir.  I just wonder  what you mentioned  the other day  Danny no longer was there  and he never said why.  Oh, no.  That was, you know,  we fuck with you guys.  I don't want to play  my cards here  but we fuck with you guys  all the time.  What do you think?  We got a Danny soundboard?  He's been talking  for the past couple of days.  He just talked  two minutes ago.  Thank you, man.  Watch this one. 
[00:34:00]  Watch.  Watch.  I'll hit this button.  Go ahead.  There's seven dicks  in my ass  and there's always room  for eight.  Oh, wait a minute.  That was a Fezzy soundboard.  Great.  Now Fezzy's going to cry.  No.  Don't make Fezzy cry.  Jesus.  He doesn't understand jokes sometimes.  Is he still crying a lot?  I don't know.  Whatever.  Just leave him alone.  It's kind of annoying  to be honest with you.  Oh, my goodness.  Huh?  No, he's going to cry now.  I know.  Well, we love Fezzy  because of any questions.  I don't even think they... 
[00:34:30]  We like you.  We love you.  All right.  Like.  Enjoy your vacation.  More Al Sharpton  on the O'Reilly factor.  O'Reilly asked Sharpton  about describing MJ  as another MLK Jr.  You got up there  in front of the world yesterday  and you portrayed him  as another Martin Luther King Jr.  He brought us all together.  He did.  First of all,  people can go to my Facebook page.  That's hyperbole.  People can go to my Facebook  and see the whole speech.  What I said was...  I saw the whole speech.  What I said was  that Michael Jackson 
[00:35:00]  in his career,  pop culture,  broke down racial barriers.  First black  to get MTV  to run black's videos,  his.  First black  to get people  like Rolling Stone  who are blacks on the cover.  These are facts.  This is not my guess  that We Are The World  was the first-time  superstar  that other superstars  to have African hunger.  This is a fact.  You may not like it.  Mr. King may not like it.  But those are facts.  And I think that  for me to say  that there's  for you and anyone else  to raise allegations 
[00:35:30]  about his personal life  doesn't answer  the fact of what he did.  He brought people together.  So why didn't you  just talk about  the fact that  he was great  and talented  and stuff like that?  You were the one that...  Al was the one  that brought it up.  He's the one that brought up  all the racial shit.  But it's like  those things are probably accurate.  Yeah, look,  Thriller was around  the time MTV was in its infancy.  He probably was  the first black artist  to get major players.  It's like,  okay, fine.  But no one's questioning it.  Yeah, no one's questioning it.  No one's saying 
[00:36:00]  it was a bad thing.  No one's saying...  Like, what the fuck?  There was no place for it  at a memorial.  No place for it.  And only you  are paying attention,  Reverend Al.  In my circle,  when Thriller came out  and Michael Jackson  was all over MTV,  I'm like,  wow, this is some cool shit.  It was like,  oh my God,  finally a black guy!  He's black?  What?  That never crossed my mind  and I swear to you.  And I'll tell you...  And I didn't know  Michael Jackson  was the first black guy  on the cover of Rolling Stone.  In my world,  who cares? 
[00:36:30]  Rolling Stone stinks.  It was like Hendrix was  years and years ago.  Probably.  There was probably  a million black guys  on the cover of Rolling Stone  before Michael Jackson.  And I think  J.J. Jackson  was the first black man  on MTV.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, MTV was the truth.  J.J. Jackson.  Yeah.  Yeah, one of the original  fucking video DJs  was a black guy,  remember Al?  So what are you talking about?  That's right.  And you know what?  I forgot that he was black.  I just remember him  as one of the originals.  J.J. Jackson.  I just sit there and go,  oh, oh, a black guy. 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  That's what Al's...  Oh.  That's what Al's concept is  of every white person.  We just sit there  and the second a black person  does something,  we go,  look at that black person  doing that.  What?  No.  Is that the cover  of Rolling Stone?  Oh.  1968 Rolling Stone cover.  Is that really a cover?  Sure it is.  Fuck you, Reverend Al.  Jimi Hendrix.  Stop misrepresenting everything.  Riffing like a motherfucker  on that guitar.  Look at him. 
[00:37:30]  Reverend Al is a liar.  That's what I said.  Reverend Al is a racist.  Lying racist.  1968 Rolling Stone cover.  There it is.  Danny has in front of us  Jimi Hendrix on the cover  of Rolling Stone magazine.  These effects.  That's a mere 20 some odd years  before Michael Jackson  was on the cover.  I would assume Jackson  was on the cover,  what, 80...  When did Thriller come out  again?  84?  I want to say 83.  84?  84?  Okay.  I guarantee there's other  black guys on the covers too.  Oh, I guarantee there's other  black guys on the cover.  The oldest ready was never on the cover.  I don't know if Rolling Stone 
[00:38:00]  existed when he died, but...  Stop.  Not fall ready.  Here's an issue of  Rolling Stone from 1967.  This is Jordan from Scranton, PA  with Tina Turner.  Tina Turner.  There you go.  Who is, to the best of my knowledge,  he writes,  black on the cover  of Rolling Stone.  To the best of your knowledge.  There's Tina right there.  67.  There's two.  Reverend Al,  we found two.  Without even trying,  we found two black entertainers  on the cover  of Rolling Stone magazine. 
[00:38:30]  God, what's wrong with him?  He's just a shit heap.  Liar.  He's got his own agenda.  He doesn't answer questions.  He's full of shit.  Full of shite.  But again, see,  he's not a dummy though,  because saying something like that  to O'Reilly...  Another Hendrix.  It's a tough...  That's another Hendrix  on the cover.  So now we found,  Reverend Al,  three Rolling Stone covers  with black entertainers on.  Two by...  One by Mr. Hendrix  and one by Tina Turner.  There's another black guy.  Is that another black guy? 
[00:39:00]  I can't tell.  Yeah, that's a black guy.  Sun Ra?  Anybody know who that is?  Sun Ra.  What year is this?  This is 69.  He's Blasian.  He might be Asian, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Can't tell.  Oh my...  I'll say yes.  I'm going to say yes too.  Because I'm like Reverend Al.  Just because of that feature.  Right there.  He just says shit.  Yeah.  Yes!  And no one calls him out on it.  If you're O'Reilly  in that moment, 
[00:39:30]  it's kind of hard  to just go out.  It's like he said  something like that  in the moment of an interview.  And then you have to go out  after the interview  and talk about it after.  But it's like in that moment,  it's hard to nail him  unless you already know  like, you know,  Hendrix and Tina Turner.  Like, I wouldn't have known that.  Yeah, but it took two seconds.  Well, he's a...  It took two seconds.  Yeah.  Did you just find  another black entertainer  on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine?  It's really not that hard to find.  It's very...  That's another one.  Now they're going by so fast.  What are we at?  To five or six now?  Miles Davis. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, Miles...  A little entertainer  named Miles Davis, Reverend Al.  Miles Davis.  Who?  What?  Never heard of him.  And by the way, Reverend Al,  I love Miles Davis  and I'm a white dude.  I don't.  It's good Sunday morning.  No, no, no.  He's black.  I won't buy his music.  Jimmy, when you're doing  your Sudoku  and drinking a cup of coffee,  you throw a little  Miles Davis on.  We say in my house,  if it ain't white,  we don't buy it.  That's what we say  in my home.  Hey, wait.  What was the great  Miles Davis album?  Was it kind of blue?  Somebody out there?  Any Miles Davis fans?  Oh, we did this break right.  Never mind. 
[00:40:30]  What year was Michael Jackson on?  I attempted to turn you guys  on Miles Davis.  Yeah.  You were horrified.  You failed miserably.  Was Michael Jackson on  as a kid before everyone else?  Was that Sly and the Family Stone?  That Sly and the Family Stone,  Reverend Al,  on the cover of  Rolling Stone magazine.  1970s.  Six black people  on the cover right there,  I think.  Six shwoogies on one cover.  Oh, my God.  Now, come on.  So, can we find out  Michael's first appearance  on Rolling Stone magazine?  Was it back when he was  a kid with the Jackson 5?  Oh, we just found  little Richard on the cover  of Rolling Stone magazine,  Reverend Al. 
[00:41:00]  What is he talking about?  He just sucks dicks.  It's terrible.  Should we go with  all the black musicians  that were on MTV  before Michael Jackson?  You want us to go  down that road, too?  Yeah.  We already have Eddie Grant.  We know Eddie Grant  made it on MTV.  That Electric Avenue song.  He just says shit.  Who said that?  Jimmy?  He just says shit.  Rolling Stone cover.  And there's Michael Jackson  on the cover  of Rolling Stone magazine.  This is Michael's  first appearance  on Rolling Stone.  It was 71. 
[00:41:30]  71.  So, all the covers  that we had just looked at  were prior to 71.  And I'll be honest.  When you just popped up  the young Michael Jackson  on the cover of  Rolling Stone magazine,  I got really nervous.  Like, oh, shit.  Reverend Al was right.  Oh, my God.  It's 1965.  Right.  But no, you're sure  that was the first time  he was on the cover?  1971?  71.  And all the ones  you found were before that.  So, okay.  We just found close to 10  black entertainers  on the cover of  Rolling Stone magazine  before Michael Jackson,  Reverend Al.  But you don't want  to acknowledge those people?  If I was a black entertainer,  I would be pissed off.  Yeah.  If I was one of those 
[00:42:00]  old dudes like  Little Richard or...  Yeah, he insulted  every single one of them.  Miles Davis.  I'm sure you listened  to some Miles Davis  growing up, Reverend Al.  Every one of them beforehand.  More Reverend Al  and O'Reilly  sort of going at it.  I don't want to  misrepresent this.  This isn't like  amazing audio.  I heard a lot  of people yesterday,  and I think you were  one of them,  but correct me if I'm wrong,  saying that  Michael Jackson  was some kind of  African-American icon.  Yeah, he was.  Well, then why did 
[00:42:30]  he have white children?  What does that have to do?  Well, what does that  have to do?  He chose to have  in vitro  by a white woman  and a white man.  What does that have to do?  What about Madonna?  In order for him  to be an African-American  icon...  An icon?  An icon?  Why would he have  that choice?  Why?  I'm trying to answer you.  Would you like an answer  from an African-American?  Yes.  Ugh.  Because he broke  all records.  He changed music.  He brought people... 
[00:43:00]  No, no, I think  they can't.  The kids, the kids.  We didn't say he was  an African-American  father of African-American  children.  You said he was an  icon.  He is.  But why would he have  white kids then?  What he did in his  personal life,  his personal life,  has nothing to do  his iconic status?  Oh, really?  It doesn't?  If I said that Bill O'Reilly  has a hot television show,  does that mean I have  the right to go to  your house and say,  but how come his kids  chew bubble gum?  What does one have  to do with the other?  If they were black...  Sharpton was right there, 
[00:43:30]  though, because that  was a dumb question  because you could  question Madonna's  iconic status.  You absolutely can.  By saying he's a black...  He's got white kids,  it really is an  irrelevant point who  he adopts.  Yeah, I agree with you.  It's a dumb point.  Yeah.  You know, it's almost  like if he had...  He's got a black icon  and yet he did so much  to deny...  If you look at  the white children  along with just  the white women  he dated and the way  he wore his hair  and the way he  changed his features  completely de-Africanizing  his face.  That's better.  That's a totally 
[00:44:00]  different...  Red lipstick on his  face, cleft...  Just all these things.  The circles he hung  out with were not  black people.  He hung out with  Liz Taylor and...  Brooke Shields.  Brooke Shields  and Macaulay Culkin  and fucking...  Married two white women.  Who's that other drunk  that married the homo?  Liza?  Liza.  The, um...  You know, Deborah Rowe.  Yeah, see?  He would, uh...  It's like when you're 
[00:44:30]  questioning those choices  of who people hang out,  then you go,  but he used the nation  of Islam to provide  security.  He would have an answer  for that.  Yeah, I know.  But what he did  by totally changing  all the features  of his face,  all those larger,  thicker features  and making them  narrow and white.  Come on,  and you can't deny that.  Exactly.  And finally,  one more clip here  from last night,  Bill O'Reilly  and Reverend Al.  If you were just  to say that Michael  Jackson was an  extraordinary entertainer  that broke down  entertainment barriers,  I'd be agreeing 
[00:45:00]  with you 100%.  But you went farther  than that.  And you put him up  as some kind  of civil rights hero.  And it doesn't wash.  And I maintain  it washes with the millions  upon millions of people.  Doesn't wash with the facts.  You said you were  going to give me  the last word.  I did.  The fact is  he sold more records  than anyone in history.  The fact is  he broke every record.  And you and Mr. King  with these imaginary  millions that are against him  can't document.  I can document  the millions  that was with Mr. Jackson.  I can only see you  and Mr. King  and some undocumented people 
[00:45:30]  that are upset  that he holds the record.  I'm not upset about anything.  I want to put the man  in proper context.  And the proper context  is he broke all those records.  He's not a black icon.  We're talking about  a fact  that he broke those barriers  and those barriers  were very important.  Other people  because he broke those barriers  are able to use  those means now  to enhance their careers.  Sharpton just kicked  his shit out of him.  Sharpton deflects 
[00:46:00]  everything.  Teflon.  But the bottom line  is first of all  the Beatles sold more records  I believe than Michael Jackson.  Am I wrong about that?  The Beatles  and Elvis I think.  I think the Beatles  are the biggest sellers  of all time.  I'm not sure.  And again  O'Reilly can't be expected  to know  who was on the cover  right before Michael Jackson  was in 71.  But the fact  that caller  was fucking smart man.  He didn't say to him  why are you paying  this is not  you know  a million dollars  would even be understandable  because of the legal fees  that would mount. 
[00:46:30]  This is 15 million fucking dollars.  That raises everyone's eyebrows.  And Michael Jackson  knew that at the time  so you know  why is he making that deal?  For real  why is he making that deal?  Why didn't he mention  the alpha man's bones  or all this other weird shit  that he did?  Michael Jackson pays off  a guy  15.3 million dollars  and he expected  everyone to go  alright we're done with this  and move on.  No  there are people  going to be like  alright what is this about?  Yeah  So he wasn't ending nothing  by paying 15.3 million  and he 
[00:47:00]  Beatles  Elvis  and Bing Crosby  have sold  more records  than Michael Jackson  but those are white people.  So two out of the three things  he said  were wrong.  Right.  He's not the biggest selling artist  of all time.  No.  He was not the first black  on the cover of Rolling Stone.  And I don't know  and he's probably not  the first black artist  on MTV.  I bet he's not even  the first black artist  to get heavy rotation on MTV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I almost want to  say Rick James  had some time on MTV  but 
[00:47:30]  I don't know  maybe that's a stretch.  Yeah I don't know  it's a weird timing thing there  I don't know  because I  I know MTV  used to take  videos that weren't videos  like they  they used to be filmed  things from like  Don Kirshner's  rock concert  and throw them on there  and things like that.  But I hope this  I hope this is the start  of  everybody calling out  Reverend Al  on his horse shit  I really hope  but you know what  I bet you it doesn't  Black artists  on MTV 
[00:48:00]  Tina Turner  Donna Summer  Eddie Grant  and Musical Youth  all aired on MTV  before Michael Jackson's  Billie Jean  but he is considered  the first black artist  to be played  in heavy rotation  and the reason  it was heavy rotation  because that was  that was a crossover  there's something  called a crossover  Elvis Presley  was a crossover  artist  entertainer  it happens  all the time  Michael Jackson  was a crossover 
[00:48:30]  that's all  that's why  he was in heavy rotation  that Reverend Al  just annoys  the piss out of me  when he gets on  these shows  and deflects  let's stick to the issue  no  no  answer the question  he will not  answer a question  that's how  that's why everybody  goes wow  the guy's great  at debating  no he's not  he's terrible at it  he doesn't answer  a question  if you actually  look at the debate  he's not answering 
[00:49:00]  he's pontificating  and just saying  why did he have  white kids  it's really  it's a non-point  it doesn't matter  yeah that was stupid  of Bill O'Reilly  who gives a shit  there's  how many  Hollywood assholes  out there  just snatching up  little Africans  or Asian  I mean look at  Tom Cruise's kids  or look at  Angelina Jolie  the kids they adopted  from all over the world  it's just  why are we  irrelevant  why are we forgetting  the great  Herbie Hancock  oh my god 
[00:49:30]  we're going to talk  about black artists  on MTV  remember that  with the little  robot legs kicking  yeah  could you give me  a little Herbie Hancock  what was the name  of that song  I don't know  I really don't know  oh  they just had to  make up a name  because  Herbie Hancock  I love when they  make up names  for instrumentals  it's just like  yeah  okay  and then there were  little robot things  can we do a little  Herbie  no it was Rocket  oh my god  who's on the board  why would you play  anything but 
[00:50:00]  the huge hit  from Herbie Hancock  oh shit  how about you play  Rocket  yeah let's go  with Rocket  oh my god  what did he just  play  helped me play  yeah this  this was  a huge hit  on MTV  before Thriller  very heavy rotation  yes  yes  the video  was all weird  the scary  robotic legs  and heads 
[00:50:30]  and stuff  he got things  moving in that  video  things were  coming to life  alright  there you go  this was good  shit  should we take  a little break  I want to listen  to a little  Herbie Hancock  Rocket  oh I don't want  to listen to it  on three  if you're going  to play Herbie  Hancock  turn it up  this would be  this should be  used in a movie  like now 
[00:51:00]  I mean like now  this would be  perfect for a scene  I actually  picture it in my head  I do a thing  where I'm  I'm doing a thing  where I'm an  undercover detective  and I'm running  around peeking  in like doorways  with my gun  held up to this music  that's perfect  and I'm looking  for a criminal  that's perfect  and I'm wearing  like a fedora  and like when it  goes  like my head  turns to the left  the president  isn't in danger  no the president  I saved in my  last one  ah right  okay I forgot  about that last  movie  yeah this one  is called  the giant bomb 
[00:51:30]  is hidden  and I have to  go and find  the giant bomb  it's right here  in the open  a bunch of  children  have a giant  bomb near them  but I have to  go and find them  and there you are  sneaking around  with a fedora  yeah  creeping  with my pen  writing things down  yeah  yeah  Jimmy Slade  is my name  Jimmy Slade  I like Jimmy Slade  Danny's got a little  something up  Jimmy Slade stinks  you think he's a fool  he's a buffoon  he's gonna get it all wrong 
[00:52:00]  Danny's got something up  on the screen  that's important  to the discussion  Prince was on MTV  before Jackson  that Purple Rain  no way  it wasn't Purple Rain  Red Corvette probably  1999  Raspberry Beret  that was his second  video actually  Little Red Corvette  was Prince's  second video  which premiered  in March  of 83  which was actually  the same month  that Billie Jean  had premiered  but there was  a video before it  yeah it was  the Prince's  1999 video  in December of 82  yeah that was  a little song  for Prince 
[00:52:30]  and MTV  you're right  1999 wasn't  a heavy rotation  on fucking MTV  unbelievable  god  fuck  alright we'll take  a break  and say we're not  splitting hairs  but don't say it  like it's a fact  yeah  it's not a fact  just stop  the Rolling Stone thing  I mean we just named  massive black entertainers  yeah  Tina Turner was huge  Jimi Hendrix  was huge  it's not like you have  to go through the archives  and find 
[00:53:00]  it's the second issue  of Rolling Stone  with black artists  the second issue  it was  the female artist  that we had brought up  I can't remember  Tina Turner  so right from the get go  Rolling Stone said  look we're going to  acknowledge all performers  we don't have an agenda here  if you're putting a black artist  on the back over your magazine  Michael opened that up  on the second issue  Michael opened it up  did he  did he really  no  he's a very talented  singer and dancer  and he should have been  addressed as such  by Reverend Al Sharpton 
[00:53:30]  he should have addressed  the fact that the family  and fans  suffered a great loss  blah blah blah blah  to get into the race angle  like he did  was nothing but  self-serving  separatism  and racism  and that's the thing  that keeps  the racist Al Sharpton  in his lovely  expensive suits  there you go  we got other things  to do today  we're going to start  singing out of our  Michael Jackson shit  but after the break  National Enquirer  reporting  I think Michael Jackson 
[00:54:00]  what was the number  I read it last night  10,000 pills  in three months  something like that  it's going to come out  it's going for the record  10,000 pills  in three months  or something like that  the first huge  drug addict  they had a whole  list of the pills  that they pretty much  could say he was  taking  yeah  amazing  and also a book  coming out that  good old Michael  was gay  and dressed as a woman  for his lovers  sexy at least 
[00:54:30]  if you look at the face  and the hair  it kind of makes sense  you could turn that  into a female  pretty quickly  oh Jesus  easily  a little lipstick  a little  maybe it was a tranny  that's not that  big far stretch  you never know  right  we go to break  with this is really funny  Jimmy  Jimmy M.E.  right  Jim C  the same one  or another one  no the same one  I like this one  there's a little  too much music in it  we only played it once  Derek and Steve  came up with this  we love the Jim C  character  Opie and Anthony  you guys are kidding me 
[00:55:00]  we're just playing  a Michael Jackson song  for the hell of it  is that it  exactly  back with the Opie and Anthony show  they can hear their  Michael Jackson  in other places  we don't need to do that  thank you  I'll tell you one thing  every time you go to the bathroom 
[00:55:30]  here at Sirius XM  that Haley's Comet song  is playing  enough with the Haley's Comet  and the  and the  and the moon  and the  I don't even know  what the fuck  the guy's singing about  who does that  some kind of love song  it's like  one of the hottest songs  in America  and I swear  9 out of the 10 times  you walk into the bathroom  because  they choose the channel  to be played in the men's room  in the bathroom  yeah  and it's either like  the Elvis channel  I like it's raining men  that's a good one  you shove it in the glory hole  they pick the Elvis channel 
[00:56:00]  or the pop channel  that's it  because I guess  they got to keep it safe  while people are making duties  in the men's room  everything has to be safe  of course  I just can't  very safe around here  I just can't live in this world  too much longer  I don't understand  this doesn't need to be  a safe environment  we're just dopey radio assholes  I know  so when will people realize that  you go in the bathroom  and you hear  this Haley's Comet song  yeah  Comet  Comet  you got it  well save it for Jimmy 
[00:56:30]  because I think Jimmy  will really be annoyed by this  here comes Jimmy now  who does Haley's Comet  I'm hoping this is the same one  that you heard  but  it's actually called  Second Chance  by Shinedown  I guess  that's it  it's a new song right  oh my god  every time you're in the bathroom  listen to these lyrics  is the right thing  I don't know  I just know it at the hook  does it make you shit well though  oh fuck it flows 
[00:57:00]  just to get out right  you want to shit quick  I think it's just like  yeah  wait for the hook  I watch the world outside  just trying to get emotion out of you  it's a bit general  and it's working  I love when an artist  can just grab emotion out of you  oh they take those hearts  even the man in the moon disappears 
[00:57:30]  someone's in the stratosphere  this makes no sense  is he killing himself  this is my life  I hope they understand  understand what?  I'm not angry  I'm just saying 
[00:58:00]  sometimes goodbye  is a second chance  alright  it's okay  I haven't heard it yet  I've not heard that at all  then you  you don't go to the bathroom  they call me the tinkle kid  I know they do  that's why I'm shocked  they do  that's my nickname  around here  even the big bosses  the tinkle kid  high five  small little guys  and soose  tinkle kid  and I just high five them  that song is played  all the fucking time  is what I'm getting at 
[00:58:30]  I've not heard it  it's not a bad song  it's kind of catchy  catchy  I don't really want to have to  pay attention to the lyrics  that's right  but they just pound it  into your head  pound it  pound it  pound it  they want to drive you  out of that bathroom  quickly  that's why they do that  really  it cuts down on productivity  when you're sitting on the shitter  there's some animals  that work here too  yeah  oh yeah  let's clean the shit  off the fucking toilet seat  please  how angry are you  how angry are you  that you have to shit  on the actual toilet seat 
[00:59:00]  and then you leave it there  I don't think I've ever shit  on a toilet seat  what the fuck is going on  in your world  that you have to do that  it's always hit the water  and this isn't like  the port authority  or the you know  a subway bathroom  it's a nice work environment  and every once in a while  there's shit on the toilet seat  it's supposed to be people  that know how to use a bathroom  look we're all angry  but we don't leave our shit  on the toilet seat  it's just amazing  or the urine  all over the toilet seat  what's that about  that's a little easier 
[00:59:30]  to understand though  than shit is just antisocial  wait  so you leave a little urine  on the toilet seat  you're not cleaning it up  I normally will  but I can see  what I'll do is  I'll pee  if I get some on the seat  I'll usually wrap some paper  in my hand  and just do a quick wipe  that's what I would do  not in a public bathroom  you would just let it be  well I'm not pissing  all over the place  and I lift the seat up  with my foot  and then I put the seat  back down  so if it's on that rim  that no one sees  oh no no no  I'm talking about  where your fanny goes  language  no no  I wouldn't piss 
[01:00:00]  with the seat down  like that  you ever see shit  I'll lift that fucker up  you ever see shit  on a wall in a urinal  what's that about  on a urinal  huh  in a urinal  oh oh oh  in the stall  I'm sorry  in the stall  what's that about  I've seen shit everywhere  ceilings  floors  walls  how the fuck  do you even do that  I don't know  but it's amazing  to me  you have to have a sprayer  people do that  how do you do that  what are you  why  what are you trying to say  what are you trying to say  my asshole's got like  a fucking

[01:01:00]  at home  you know  because then I can take a brush  and brush it all off  so there's no residual  yeah  you don't want that  it's embarrassing  what are some of those other songs  that are just pounding  into our heads these days  that poker face  I don't know that one either  boy you are listening  to some fucking shit  dude it's everywhere though  I don't hear it  everywhere  not where I'm listening  not where I'm listening either  if you want to throw me  under the bus  it's fine  but this shit is everywhere you go  dude it's the best station  on the whole platform

[01:09:00]  that's another one  some people are just  going pubic bald  yeah I don't understand  the pubic hair  I understand  falling out  maybe one  but every once in a while  you get into a situation  you're like  what the fuck  went on before I got here  that's people that  don't shower enough  I believe  right  and wash  you know wash down there  it gets rid of  any shedding hairs  or anything  you don't want to  would you guys like  blow the hair off  or like just  go in another stall  I just  I just pee right on 
[01:09:30]  the fucking thing  I could care less  I try to piss  because I'm not touching anything  and make the hair  go into the bowl  without pissing  on the floor  it's very good  you know you gotta get  it keeps your aiming  skills up  it's like finding that  when you used to be able  to smoke inside  the best was a cigarette butt  in the toilet  because you'd have to  chase that thing around  and the goal was to  bust apart the cigarette butt  so that the tobacco  would come out  and then get the paper  actually to unroll  off the filter  and then blast 
[01:10:00]  a hole through the paper  that to me  was the trifecta  of pissing  on a cigarette butt  all right  I forgot to tell you guys  you ever play  Battleship like that  where it was like  you'd make believe  you were a  a fighter plane  or a bomber  and that was  an enemy ship  and you'd have to  until it falls apart  until it falls apart  do it all the time  that's a great little game  splitter in two  nice  kills 30 seconds  what the hell  of course  Jimmy I forgot to tell you 
[01:10:30]  a lot of days  Jimmy and I get driven  home by Kenny  yesterday you missed  a great one  why  and unfortunately  I wasn't videotaping  fucking Kenny  took out a  I think  I want to say  a seagull actually  away  holy mother of god  you know what  they always say  don't worry about birds  they'll never get hit  by cars  it's very rare  well this bird  dive bombed  to get another bird  I guess  oh shit  right in front of us  and we knew  there was no way  this bird was  getting out of the way  we looked through 
[01:11:00]  the rear view mirror  and all we saw  and I'm not exaggerating  maybe Kenny could  back me up on this  was a cloud  of feathers  feathers  Kenny how crazy  was that yesterday  I'll keep these numbered  for just such an emergency  if it isn't the bird killer  first of all  hello Dave Winfield  you speak the truth  GH  was that pretty amazing  it wasn't one or two  he called you an idiot  yes  besides that  hold on  Sammy Davis Jr.  shoes wants to say  something  I don't like your 
[01:11:30]  fucking Jim Crow  era shoes  they really bother me  I'm a snappy dresser  yes you are  fucking  if you're going to  meet J. Edgar Hoover  fucking  go ahead  sorry  I'd be wearing  a dress then  it wasn't one  or two feathers  it was  you're right  it was impressive  right  yeah yeah yeah  I've never seen  that before  and then we never  saw the bird again  like what  so then it was  on another block  or two to my house  and we looked for it 
[01:12:00]  and no sign of it  what part of the vehicle  did you think nailed it  we don't know  if it hit the front  or it got sucked in  underneath  and then like  came out the other side  we don't know  that's what we're  trying to figure out  I wanted to like  check and make sure  I didn't damage  my vehicle  of course  that's the important part  there was no marks  on the front  no  so I don't know  what happened to  you know  we didn't check  the engine compartment  oh I hope it's up there  rotting  you think it might be in there  looks like a perfect turkey  cooked turkey  sitting on your  air cleaner  that would make me happy 
[01:12:30]  your brand new truck  all of a sudden  you turn the air conditioner on  and fucking bird parts  come shooting all over you  tuxedo  beak come shooting out  it was  chicken killer  it was amazing  it was an amazing sight  for real  I never saw so many  feathers in my life  there was a seagull  once with my work van  a windshield  same thing  and the thing  it was right at the  upper left hand corner  of the windshield  I was on the expressway  so  really flying  it made such a thud  it cracked the windshield 
[01:13:00]  in the corner  and left  this big thing  of dust  like I guess  the bird is dusty  you know  that's what they do  they get in the dirt  and make themselves dusty  that's how they take  their little bird bath  and it left  a shit load of dust  but I looked in the rear view  and just saw them  like flying over  the van  and then wham  hit the expressway  dead on arrival  he was done  we never saw the bird again  there's no way  it flew off  no  I think when he went  after that other bird  maybe he was trying

[01:16:00]  serial killer  right  yeah  we got him  dead as shit  yeah they blew  him up  dead  oh in where  in Carolina  yeah  oh okay  I think he  decided he  wanted to rob  something in  I believe  North Carolina  and they got  good  good  yeah  it was a  drug binge  for about a  week and he  killed five  people so  you know  so it really  wasn't a serial  killer that guy  was just  completely insane  lost it  well serial killers  are too I know  but it's a 
[01:16:30]  different kind of  insanity  yeah yeah  he had a rap  sheet 29 pages  long  so why did  me call him  about a few  months ago  he probably was  a serial killer  if you have a  pattern you are  his motive might  have been drugs  or money  but he was  no he just  went just  nuts and killed  five quick people  he wasn't thinking  about it and  collecting stuff  oh no  all that weird  so it's more like  mass murder  that's what I  would say  yes  uh Phil  kills are so  calculated  yeah I worked at a  Sears plumbing  department one  summer in  Colorado  yeah tell me

[01:17:30]  come is it is  it a proper term  to go always  white walling  tires or no  no I don't  think you can  white wall  your tires  I think they  used to have  these kits  from like  one of those  JC Whitney  catalog where  you can actually  put white walls  on your tires  you can armor all  them though I  remember I was  armor all  well yes you  can make them  very nice  white walls  are the dumbest  thing to have  why would  why was that  ever a fad  why is it  a white wall  tires  the stripe on  them  the white stripe  yeah it looks 
[01:18:00]  silly and it  would always get  all mucked up  on a curb  or something  I'm sure it  looked cool  at the time  when it was  the thing  when you had  like tail fins  on the car  yes  big cat lack  we don't  understand it  I love that  car  yeah it's in  my wife's  name  yeah okay  mr hole in  your head  and your  bloody wife  next to you  I like a  nice I like  a nice shiny  tire I really  do that is  nice when you  armor all those  tires one of  my girlfriends  told me I was  insensitive because  I was busy  arm rolling my 
[01:18:30]  tires when I  was supposed to  be taking her  for a hysterectomy  relax you can  wait never let  a girl think  that your your  tire shine is  is more important  than the removal  of her uterus  it's cause for  resentment  it could  could be  well we got this  steve mcnair info  finally  yeah  she's pretty sexy  that iranian chick 
[01:19:00]  did your thing  no she wasn't  dude she had  nice fucking legs  and juicy little  rump  fucking no  I'm so glad you  said that  me too  she didn't look  all that bad  she wasn't sexy  she was all right  I'll be honest  with you  it's something we  talk about on the  show she had  youth on her  side  yeah and she  was iranian  even sexy  which you know  you gotta mark  it on a curve  dude I'm looking  at her body in  this picture  she was just  all right  look at the  body though  she was a sexy  girl  yeah cause she  was young  young girls  have really nice  bodies  nice legs on  that last one  his name's  michael like 
[01:19:30]  yours  stems  we solved  this mystery  over a week  ago didn't we  yes  we basically  told everybody  and said  look  jealousy  murder  suicide  the  end  yeah  Nashville police  have confirmed  ex-NFL star  Steve McNair  was shot and  killed by his  girlfriend  investigators say  McNair was sleeping  on a couch  when he was shot  twice in the head  and twice in the chest  his 20 year old  girlfriend then  turned the gun  on herself 
[01:20:00]  McNair a married  father of four  had reportedly  been having an  affair with the  woman for several  months  police originally  labeled the death  a homicide  but had been  waiting for test  results before  confirming what  happened  investigators have  not released a  motive for the  murder suicide  but they say  they think  the young woman  suspected McNair  was also involved  with another woman  a third woman  not his wife  I love how  some of the media  people are saying  Steve McNair  led a secret  life  no he didn't  I think 
[01:20:30]  I think  a lot of the  wives of the  athletes just  put up with  their nonsense  they kind of  know  what the deal  is  and the  secret I guess  was that he  was seeing  another woman  besides  another woman  another other  woman  you know what  I mean  he was only  seeing this  crazy bitch  for a few  months though  I would bet  that the wife  knew exactly  what her husband  was up to  there's pictures  of him all over  the place  what the fuck  yeah he went  on vacation  with her  so that's not  a secret  you're not  fucking twittering  pictures  I want to know  how you pull  that one off  to the cheaters 
[01:21:00]  out there  okay  alright  you go away  for a night  you know  whatever  I could  figure that  one out  but how do  you  how do you  go away  for a week  on vacation  with another  woman and your  wife doesn't  suspect anything  that's just  bad game  that's just  having some  bad game  right there  she was probably  the wife was  probably in the  same hotel  he probably  had balls  of steel  he never  fucking saw it  coming  just took it  out  no just went  to sleep  last thing  you remember  was fucking  a 20 year old  to go out  yeah  now he's like 
[01:21:30]  you know  what the fuck  I've been sleeping  a long time  now that's a guy  that went out  when do I wake up  that's a guy  that went out  doing what he loves  you know  that wasn't even  his main house  it was a condo  he rented with his friends  and him and his friend  probably had a pussy pad  yeah  you like when I say that  pussy pad  we've talked to enough  athletes over the years  we know this shit  goes on  and I think the wives  just look the other way  go eh  I got a really nice house  I got the kids  I always wanted  you know  I hate to do this  to the women  right now  but there are broads  out there  that will accept  all that  why wouldn't she  wake him up first 
[01:22:00]  like hey  maybe she did  because he might  be able to talk  out of it  they probably know  if he was awake  or asleep  how  they probably would  they know all that  Santa  fuckers are amazing  they put a slug on him  and the slug will tell him  figure it out  he's some kind of  forensics  Santa  I know you're awake  they knew he was  sleeping while it happened  they found a sheep  half counted  it was  it was 
[01:22:30]  it was  you know what it was  of course  Jim  it was obvious  it's always murder  she was an Iranian  what was the name  of the other girl  he was seeing  Abigail  she was a beautiful girl  shipping codeine  codeine  yes  who does codeine  she's a very slow way  to murder somebody  we think that Abigail  has been fed  a lot of eggs  she's been  being killed  on a cholesterol binge  we gotta find her 
[01:23:00]  within the next  8 to 10 years  yes  they're feeding her eggs  and telling her  they're egg whites  they're telling her  that she's having  skim lattes  but they're whole milk  Abigail's in danger  jimsy's an idiot  jimsy knows  steve mcnair  was asleep  his hands  were in the front  of his pants  cupping the top  of his penis  as a man will do  when he's tired 
[01:23:30]  jimsy they're saying  he was sleeping  on the couch  yes  he would frequently  fall asleep  on the sofa  we have little  black hairs  on the pillow  quick Sam  crease the front  of my casual slacks  I'm gonna go  fuck  they found  little straight hairs  we knew  they were Sam's  pubes  and they were  all over my 
[01:24:00]  backside  sometimes  Sam  won't mount  me like a  German shepherd  he said  before I do  anything  quince  I'm gonna  give you  a duty  hole  a pummeling  the answer  to your question  no defensive  wounds  you know  something about  guns  looks like  a defensive  wound  yeah  if he was  awake  he would  have his  hands up  or something  and there  would have  been some  damage  on his  hands  right  yeah 
[01:24:30]  this is  very interesting  let's go  to Josh  in Indiana  Josh  good morning  fellas  hello  Josh  we talking  about how  sad the  Steve McNair  story is  and it's  tragic  but we  could have  very well  been talking  the same  story about  our favorite  co-host  of a radio  show  who me  dude  half the  stuff we  talk about  on this  show could  happen to  Anthony  I mean we  all just  don't want  to acknowledge  that  I don't know  it's going  to be a  hell of a  gun battle 
[01:25:00]  I'll tell  you that  one for  the ages  one for  the ages  a hell  of a  battle  if that  ever came  to pass  I know  when to  pull the  clips out  that  Butch  Cassidy  and the  Sundance  kid  would be  nothing  compared to  what you  would go  through  in  you know  exactly  it would  look like  the final  scene  come running  out of the  bathroom  it would  look like  the last  scene of  Scarface  and somebody  in really  believable  sunglasses  and Quincy's  jacket  would walk  up and  shoot you  once in  the back  Jesus  First of 
[01:25:30]  all I don't  think I've  ever known  a girl  that can  fucking  pull the  slide back  on any  of the  pistols  that I  own  Patrice  is really  obsessed with  the Steve  McNair story  and he  tweeted  yesterday  Patrice  by the way  is big  mama prods  one word  on Twitter  Patrice  tweeted  this yesterday  Patrice  saying this  to your  new  potential  mistresses  I have  a woman  and a  family  that I  love  you're  just  side  pussy  don't  kill  me  ah  that's

[01:27:00]  nine yards  and the guy  fell on the  one yard line  it was an amazing  fucking comeback  the Titans  and who else  I forgot Jimmy  I'm not even  going to try  to make believe  I don't remember  who that was  with Super Bowls  I always forget  I don't even  remember who  was it last year  I know the Steelers  won but  huh  what year was it  03-04  oh wow  I don't even  know the year  but it was  amazing  2005  they fell  one yard  short of overtime  how do you  sleep with that  and it wasn't  even McNair  with a bullet  in your head  yeah  she probably

[01:28:30]  oh boy  oh boy  McNair is  scrambling  he should have  done this  when he was  fucking  yeah no  kidding  somehow  he gets  the pass  off  and then  this guy  should have  been tackled  on the  10  he was  tackled  on the  10  okay  this is  the whole  drive  never mind  but yeah  McNair should  have been  sacked  during that  play  he was  tackled  on the  10 yard  line  and how  many  seconds  are left  Dan  I don't  know  180 I  think  oh come  on it's a  bunch of  shit  oh  and Dick

[01:47:00]  power you can see the  gas gauge move when  i'm driving normal you  know without the  supercharger really  kicking in uh it's  fine but when when  you really get some  juice out of it oh  fuck it sucks the gas  right out sucks the  gas down half a tank  and i drove what would  have been even in the  escalade it wouldn't  have taken up you  wouldn't have even  noticed the gas gauge  going down half a  tank of gas what a  great car though what  a pisser love that  car  yeah that's  responsibly it's

[01:49:00]  absolutely yeah they are a  lot of fun what do you do  with your coffee and stuff  though isn't it too much  dude it's just especially  when you're in traffic and  stuff it's it's a it's a  distraction just become  second nature and i don't  i didn't really rip it up  with it when i was driving  a standard to be honest with  you but it was just you  steer with your you steer  with your knee you shift  and you hold your coffee  with just a good feeling  when it's time to shift you  just ah just feels good  feels right those those  wheels can break loose and  shifting into fourth gear  still what do you mean they 
[01:49:30]  just the back wheels will  just light up it's a  beautiful drive a lot of  power to it the first time i  i jumped in and put it in  first and let the clutch  out i completely smoked up  the uh what's that mean  let the clutch out i  never heard it but i  don't know what it means  oh the clutch it's that  little pedal all the way to  the left but what's it  you put it in first it  engages the engine to the  transmission to the rear  wheels it's the little  thing between the i don't  know what it is you don't 
[01:50:00]  know what i've heard i  know the clutch but when  you say let the clutch out  i put it in first and spun the  wheels how the fuck do you  do that i've seen people  give it some gas and then  let the clutch out slow and  and they move forward and  go yeah boom boom well it's  when you go and just pop the  clutch is that when you see  you hold the clutch down  until the gas is really high  and then you just let the  clutch out okay and it goes  you get instant power to the  rear wheels instead of that  slow power okay and that's  when you burn a lot of rubber  off of your tires for no 
[01:50:30]  apparent reason but to try to  look cool okay the instant  feedback is way too good uh  jimmy says drive responsibly  but he screws trannies yeah  but you know what i i never  fuck first of all let me back  up here it is i'm just  saying i'm just reading i'm  a pervert just reading i've  never done anything sexually  that was gonna plaster me  against the wall immediately  and then then you got uh  jimmy be scared and is kurt  russell and death proof now  that's a very good line would  you would you do a death  proof thing death proof with  jim norton absolutely i'd lock

[01:57:00]  sam roberts  and we were wandering around the serious xm hallways  when we found opi and anthony intern pierce  wearing a pair of goofy glasses  and holding a red rose  we approached pierce  to find out what the little idiot was planning  intern pierce you have a rose there  what are you doing  i'm gonna try and give it to megan fox  where's megan fox gonna be  uh around studio five  did you just go out and buy that rose  i did  i went home and put cologne on  changed  i'm ready  are those glasses 
[01:57:30]  yeah this is my internet persona  i put these on  and i turn into somebody else  oh so you're reenacting rose boy  the megan fox picture  that's that's precisely correct  what do you hope to accomplish by doing this  uh maybe getting on uh you know  a little internet sensation  maybe something like that  who told you about megan fox coming in  e-rock  cool well best of luck  thank you  thank you very much  megan fox coming to sirius xm  was news to us  and as backstage with ona 
[01:58:00]  is always informed  we went to e-rock  to clarify exactly what was going on  e-rock what's pierce doing  uh pierce i believe is getting ready to meet megan fox  who told him megan fox was coming in today  oh i made the time up  he was  he wanted to know when she was coming in today  so he came to you and said  when is megan fox coming in  and what'd you say  i said uh so be in at 12 o'clock  and i told him what studio  uh to go stand next to  and that's the covino and rich show  but eric that's a complete fabrication 
[01:58:30]  she's not coming to the studio at all  i know we're gonna walk him over  uh i'm gonna take a photo of him  sitting there waiting  and then i'm gonna leave  why are you doing this  because  kind of bored  so  your idea of fun is just kind of  ruining his life  yeah i learned it from you sam  oh cool  after 40 minutes of standing around  and waiting like a boob  pierce was told by sirius xm talent booker liam  to take a look into the studio window  at which point  pierce moped back to the o and a office 
[01:59:00]  where we caught up with him  pierce did you get to meet megan fox  no  why what happened  i was sad  are you embarrassed  not really i don't really care  that's that's a that's very much a lie  you were waiting outside in costume  yeah i'm just disappointed  did you think you were gonna be on the best week ever  yeah i did  are you  no  you feel like a jackass  a little bit  yeah  yeah  eric played you for a fool  he did didn't he  but he was right about that  about what 
[01:59:30]  you being a fool  yeah  as pierce tries to mask the fact that he feels like a complete moron  we all know he has complete reason to  not only was he outsmarted  but he was outsmarted by eric  obviously a career in radio is not in the future of pierce  give up your dreams buddy  you'll never be anything special  i'm primetime sam roberts  and this has been  backstage with ona  is that as loud as it goes 
[02:00:00]  i'm not gonna ask anymore  but it's as loud as it goes  well then someone has to fix what he's got to fix then  yeah this stuff is way too low in the mix  opium anthony whatever  i want to uh mention i'm gonna be on z-rock on sunday  it's on the ifc channel  what is z-rock i'm trying to figure it out  they're a band um  and uh there's three of them  and it's like it's like it's kind of like an improv show  i mean there's a very loose script around it  and um 
[02:00:30]  it's uh lynn coppett stars in it  and jay okerson who's very funny on it  and uh it's kind of a non-scripted show  and i'm in it with uh with chris jericho  and uh  but you hated chris jericho  we had that argument but after that we were fine  he was actually very cool  yeah you guys are cool now right  very cool  and uh  of course i i do get a show plug in  um  to the uh fucking  final  cut  wow  yes  i even mentioned monday through friday  it's on the show  yes it is 
[02:01:00]  it made the cut  of course it did  i actually did  believe it or not  whore that i am  i mentioned sirius xm  but it was too long of a plug  and i think they just chopped  i actually did get that in  but the opium anthony show got on there  don't touch that paper kenny  what is on that paper  it's 11 o'clock on the ifc channel  on uh sunday  so those guys are fucking very cool  very good man  oh just photos i guess  from uh  from the episode  oh they don't have any photos of me on the website  good move  if i try to buy pot from a little kid  he's a very tussleable lad  let me see that article 
[02:01:30]  if that's the article  because cory feldman is uh  is hurting  and uh  we need to tell the world  apparently it made the uh  internet there  i just saw a page that said cory feldman is hurting  yeah keep googling  or google bomb  keep googling cory feldman is hurting  is hurting  and an article came out yesterday  cory feldman is hurting  or is it a google bomb  see what we can get done here people  thank you to the pests  how internet uh communities attempt to force phrases like cory feldman is hurting on google trends 
[02:02:00]  uh former child star cory feldman is hurting  after michael jackson's death  he must be right  after all cory feldman is hurting  has been making its way up and down the top google trends all day  i love that people have to acknowledge our our stupidity  there's nothing better than people that have to acknowledge our shit  though feldman has posted thoughts on his website that would indicate he is indeed hurting  from having unresolved issues with michael jackson before he died 
[02:02:30]  the phrase has been  inorganically  thank you wow generated a group of organized people  a group of organized people just say it  come on  uh decide to google bomb google trends into making cory feldman is hurting  a top trending topic  google trends is a subjection of google uses  subsection of google as a way of tracking what people are searching for everyday online  a number of new  the group of people will email tweet bbm sms dm and im each other to search 
[02:03:00]  cory feldman is hurting because google trends is purely based on what the world is searching for  however there is some basis for the thought that cory feldman is hurting  he posted this passage on his website  jimmy you want to read the passage from cory feldman  he indeed is hurting  you bet he is  you want dramatic music  please  oh my god  he  he could be  not could be 
[02:03:30]  he is  the worst person  butcher you're bombing today  you are bombing my friend  you've got to be  oh my god  we've had this discussion  i don't know  maybe a hundred times  oh my god  and he still  steve where's steve  and he still sits there  yeah  play it on one  because that's really effective  and this is just the  hulk walking away music  that's not his fault 
[02:04:00]  why is it so low  i don't know  does it have anything to do with the equipment that's plugged in  we've been going back and forth  because it sounds  in there it sounds okay  but then sometimes in here it sounds low  it's so low in my headphones  but then on the air it sounds fine  so we've got to get to bottom  jim you want to ask steve a question  that we've asked a million times  here he is  how come uh  hold on  hold on  we love butcher but  derek does a good job  yeah  why won't anyone listen to us 
[02:04:30]  it's  so out of my hands at this point  um  how is it out of your hands  because there's two people above me  there's a cock in each one  there's no room to hold anything else  oh jimmy  that would imply that i'm gay  um  no  the  argument has been made numerous times  that uh  you guys want derek on the board  and uh  derek is wanted in production  uh  on a full time basis  eric has been taken over the board for the full week  but he's fallen behind in his other stuff that he was doing  the bottom line is this 
[02:05:00]  i've said it before  nothing  should come before  the on-air product  the on-air product  i don't care about anything  other than the on-air product  right  nothing  should take priority over that  it's fucking  mind-boggling  to have to explain  i'm not  i know this is over your head  can we get a montage of jimmy doing this  i've been saying this for so  i mean  maybe i'm wrong  i don't know what i'm talking about  you really don't  the things that make the live show better  no let me tell you something  no fucking opie and anthony fans 
[02:05:30]  listen and go  wow  the production was amazing  they just go wow  it was a really funny show today  it was a great show today  the production is certainly a big part of it  certainly a big part of it  but nothing is more important  than somebody  uh  and that's not an easy gig to do  and derek just happens to be  he's certainly better at it than i would be  oh i forgot about travis  he's coming back monday  travis is coming back monday  what's that kid 18  jesus how long has he been off  enough already

[02:13:00]  of course  that's  unauthorized  yeah  yeah  michael  jackson  was into  men  not boys  and masqueraded  as a woman  with his  lovers  a new book  claims  that's the  most sensational  nugget  in unmasked  the final years  of michael  jackson  a tell-all  by celebrity  biographer  ian halperin  wow  how do we  know that  name  ian halperin  is he the  one that  did  did we  have him  on the  show  we did  yes  if that's  him  this guy  isn't like  some kind  of blogger  this guy's  got some  some  some  blogger  some credit 
[02:13:30]  behind him  uh  michael would  dress up  as a woman  uh  he said  the star  once picked  up a  construction  worker  and swore  him to  secrecy  the lover  admitted  michael  made him  sign a  confidentiality  agreement  uh  halperin's book  crack cocaine  and then have  oral sex  in a small  town  in gurney  halperin's book  which hits stores  as the world  still reels  from jackson's  death  asserts that  well when  when would you  put the book out  uh  asserts that  ex-wife  lisa marie  presley  and gal pal 
[02:14:00]  brooke  shields  and tatum  o'neill  were his  beards  you think  big surprise  there  history  uh  yeah  in the making  right there  jackson never  had sex  with second  wife debbie  roe  so none  of his  three kids  are his  biological  children  that that  they could  still be his  biological  children  most likely  not  they're not  they could  have just  created in  a lab  you dummy  uh  halperin also  says jackson  is no  pedophile  and may be  a black  male  victim  so maybe  someone's gonna  say hey 
[02:14:30]  a black  male  victim  a black  male  or a  black  oh that's  why  overreacting  jim  hi that's  a new  character  overreacting  jim  yeah  push  ten pounds  of emotion  into a  two pound  bag  he'll be  popping up  today  of course  i love him  uh  yeah not a  pedophile  maybe a 
[02:15:00]  black male  victim  he says he  has documented  documents proving  jackson's nervous  insurance company  forced him to  pay millions  to a teen  who accused  him of  molestation  jackson  collapsed in  hysterics  when he  found out  he had to  do that  the insider  told  halperin  i bet  maybe  uh  maybe  plausible  deniability  you know  what  i can't  accept that  if he was  a fucking  uh  just a  guy in  the closet  i don't  think it  would surprise  anybody  that he  was gay  if he  was gay  i don't  know  when you  get to  the point

[02:33:30]  he was never negative  he's always smiling  and laughing  the victim was  29 year old  vincent smith jr  of candy  he was a temporary  who'd only been on the  job a couple weeks  his brother says  he'd been looking  for work for a long time  you know he just  prayed really hard  to get a job  and god finally  answered his prayers  and as mod said  he was always so positive  you know  god what  you know  i guess god needed  a possible  just for it to happen  like this you know  and not to know  exactly what happened  and having nobody  wanted to come speak  to us  it's just hard  you know 
[02:34:00]  it seems like  they're trying to  cover something up  or hide something  you know  he shouldn't have  fell  he should have  held on  but he was such  a butterfinger  i died  my spleen  was knocked out  through my asshole  and then i vomited 
[02:34:30]  into the chocolate  and was scarred  and died  it's good  until the agitator  spun  yes  it sounds fun  but you don't  think of swallowing  delicious snack food  you think of being  suffocated  and scalding liquid  you can't hear  anything now  now you just can't  hear anything  out of that room  there's nothing  going on  how can this happen  i can't even  express how heated  i am right now  and annoyed  as heated 
[02:35:00]  as heated  as that guy  that fell  in the  way hotter  about 120  way the fuck  hotter  why is that  the problem  today  we really  i don't know  what it sounds  out there  i have to call  it out  in radio land  but we can't  hear the audio  it's so low  so annoying  all right  at the end  of this clip  the guy  said something  about  what are they  covering up  i just got to  hear that part  again  i'm not sure  if it's  you know  just for it  to happen  like this  you know 
[02:35:30]  and not  to know  exactly what  happened  and you know  having nobody  wanted to come  speak to us  it's just hard  you know  it seems like  they're trying  to cover  something up  or hide  something  you know  you shouldn't  say cover  up  cover up  yeah  and lovely  milk chocolate  look the guy  slipped into  the stupid  vat of chocolate  it's very unfortunate  what happens  nobody wanted  the guy  to go in  the chocolate  right  yeah  right  they have to  clean the whole  vat out  right  it's a pain  in the ass  for everybody  and you know  they're going  to reuse  that vat  so if someone's  going to be  eating chocolate  that was made  from dead  guy vat  oh  it's great  his fucking  shoes  probably shit

[02:45:30]  attacked the  pair  and one of  the men  jumped or  fell into  a canal  and drowned  authorities say  it's not  clear if  51 year old  emiterio  garcia  the bees  didn't fucking  kill him  the water  did  water got  him  see what  i thought  this was  going to be  a silly  death  because i  really thought  that to  get away  from the  bees  the guy  went in  the water  and said  all right  i'll just  fucking keep  my head  under the  water  until the  bees  are gone  stay here  and then  fucking  drowned  and drowned  died from  bee stings  or drowned  but an autopsy  is scheduled  they say he  was fishing 
[02:46:00]  with a friend  tuesday night  when the bees  attacked  garcia's  friend was  able to  escape danger  by getting  into the  vehicle of a  passing motorist  but they say  garcia either  jumped or  fell into the  canal  what's her deal  does she run  out of air  she's awful  you know  probably happened  the guy went  to cast his  line in and  as he threw  his fucking  hook back  it probably  grabbed a  hornet nest  and the bees  were like  what the fuck  dude  you think  they got  angry at that  dude  how mad would  they be  youtube is fun 
[02:46:30]  because you can  watch angry bees  they fucking  hate when you  pester the nest  oh please  i want to see  some pestered bees  they go from  happy to  really angry  like that  you know what  it is  they lightly  gently buzz  around their  hive  their little  hanging hive  thing  and then the  second you  fuck it up  they're like  they're so  angered  they're just  happy to be  alive  oh those are  angry bees  yeah they leave  a camera sometimes  set up outside  the bees and  they film them  they blew  something up  there 
[02:47:00]  oh  oh the bees  attacked the  camera  oh that gave me  the heebie jeebies  yikes  heebie jeebies  yikes  there's a lot  of bees around  that camera  oh would you  be getting  stung like  fucking all  get up  oh man  if you were  there  where is that  dad it looks  like a pile  of rocks  is that  beeville  I think  beeville  USA  it's bee  town  holy shit  they're not  happy  no they are  so they're  just bouncing  into the camera  lens trying  to sting it  dude how big  is that fucking  nest can we  see the explosion  then  no we can't  did they blow  up the nest 
[02:47:30]  or was it  looks like  it  like a rock  looks like  they blew  it up  and then  what it was  the fucking bees  you're like  now what  what the fuck  I need an  explanation  oh they blew  up a big rock  that was blocking  something  oh I don't  know  they obviously  disturbed a  bee's nest  was there  somewhere  boy is that  infuriating them  oh and  you know  I know we're  moving on  from the  chocolate story  but we really  got one  more  really good  one  alright  it's Scott  in Cleveland  this could be  the best one 
[02:48:00]  yet  Scott  hello boys  happy birthday  Jimmy  thank you  I would have  held on to  the railing  but he  had  brush her  fingers  oh god  wait a minute  alright  could be the  best one  yet  holy shit  how do you  miss it  that many  times  I don't know  three times  I missed it  oh yeah  oh let's see  what do we  got  what  if this is 
[02:48:30]  what I'm  thinking  I was  yeah I've  seen this  these giant  japanese bees  the hornets  are they  a problem  nasty looking  30 of these  could kill  30,000  honeybees  no that's  crazy  30 hornets  killed  30,000  honeybees  these japanese  hornets  and they attack  honeybee hives  not africanized  honeybees  but docile ones  and they  they liquid  shit all over  the hive  but look at  this  these fucking  dude look at  the size of them  compared to  regular bees  they're beheading 
[02:49:00]  these bees  they just bite  their heads off  I love the slow  motion  it's amazing  footage  why is that tiny  little bee  trying to  fucking attack  the big  they fight back  they're brave  the little guys  just fly away  look at these  they fucking  just  fuck the queen bee  move on  dude what  idiots these bees are  these hornets  come in and just  bite the heads  off of the other bees  amazing  one after another  I would get out of there  and there's nothing  those bees could do  about it  and there was nothing  we could do about it  yes  did you really say  he be g  that is  yes  oh boy 
[02:49:30]  great footage  they are  kicking the  oh look  he bit that  bee in half  and it's still  trying to fight  how is a honeybee  I would amscray  out of there  oh it'd be gone  so fast  look at it  it's climbing up  his buddy  it's just these bees  you go on  you google  japanese hornets  on fucking  youtube  and they attack  this honeybee nest  it is  really fucking  horrifying  they're just biting  them in half  that's what they do  they can bite them  in half  so quickly 
[02:50:00]  aren't they like  four times the size  of these fucking bees  oh god damn  that is some great  photography though  yeah they probably  just leave a couple  still cats  how do they know  that the bees  are going to attack that  I'm sure they set it up  for the nice video  why not  look at that  fucking thing  it's a monster  yeah  the japanese hornets  are gigantic dude  they kill people  yeah  when they swarm  they do  they show how  they actually track  a japanese hornet nest  because they're really  fucking deadly man  is uh  they'll catch one  in a net  and they show footage 
[02:50:30]  of a guy  there's a net  what's that  nothing  there's a guy  will actually grab  the bee  while it's alive  and he ties a  fucking string  to its little bee feet  and it hangs down  and they watch it  with binoculars  and they can see  by the string flying  where it's going  really  and they have an idea  where the nest is  and they go back  at night and burn it  see if you can find  that tracking  the japanese hornet  or whatever  it's fucking  the fact that  somebody will touch  this thing  i'm sorry  i'm screaming  the fact that  somebody will touch  this thing  while it's alive 
[02:51:00]  is just really scary  did you see how  they ravage the  inside of that hive  they rip apart  the little pods  that the little  babies are in  they're so nasty  i think that's the one  we just watched  dan thanks for nothing  i'm all like  are you like itchy  and stuff  i feel like things  are crawling on me  i get little  i get all  icky  i'm such a faggot  this is not a japanese hornet  but this is like  the equivalent of one  yes  but they're very docile  away from the nest 
[02:51:30]  apparently  are they  yeah  look at the size  of this hornet  he's got a little  carrying case for him  he's petting him  he's keeping his finger out  he's petting him  he has honey  what's wrong with this guy  he's just petting it  he's tussling his little bee head  oh i want to see it sting him  so bad  it doesn't  he has honey on his finger  and the thing is eating it  look at that  fucking thing  look how cute it is  i am petrified  that bee is  this is my worst nightmare  why  the bee loves the fucking human  if it had snot coming out of its little  look at the size of that bee though 
[02:52:00]  it's as big as his thumb  yeah it's a gigantic bee  ugh  and it's not hurting him  and its stinger is laying right on the guy's finger  you wouldn't let that  uh  bee do that  i wouldn't fucking  i would run like a fucking bitch  if i even saw that thing  i would run  i'd be going  you gotta see them catch it in the net  and then the guy reaches in and grabs it  oh i guess  oh my god  and he fucking just ties a string to its feet  it's amazing  i feel things on me  hey  i don't want to lose this  someone said that uh 
[02:52:30]  pen and teller  have a bee stunt that  you gotta see  it's fucking insane  it's probably fake  oh cigars and scotch  he's good  uh  you have to google  pen and teller's bee stunt  but it's gotta be fake right  i don't know  cause it's their magicians  it's my japanese hornet nest  they're magicians  well where are we gonna go  the tell  pen and teller  or  i want to see the footage  of them catching this bee  with his bare hand  like touching it  i would never touch a bee  it was dead  no  no  even dead bees  no  i remember being a kid 
[02:53:00]  this happens to every kid  you see a dead bee laying on the ground  you gotta  fuck with him  you know  you push him around a little  and that last little stingy muscle  is still kicking  oh yeah  and he gets you  he goes good  i gotcha  what do pen and teller do  bees  it's like when they have a  it's like the guy with the grenade  underneath him  he's dead  and you turn him over  boom  blows you up  right  let's see if the pen and teller thing's worth  uh  taking a look at real fast  i don't like bees 
[02:53:30]  pen and teller bees  you know there's a certain kind of rivalry  among magicians  a kind of  one-upmanship  and we get compared once in a while  to sigmund  and leeroy  how old is this  the vegas act  pretty old  i guess because they're the other two-man magic act  and everybody gets all excited  because they produce five bengal tigers  out of  empty  boxes  well you want wild animals  we got wild animals  tell her  build a tiller 
[02:54:00]  one  two  die  five  six  seven  okay  so they're not bengal tigers  but they are  aliens  six-legged  hairy monsters  capable of injecting their flesh  with a deadly poison  yes  they're bees  but i know what you're thinking  you're saying to yourself  yeah but sigmund and leeroy  putting those little tigers  in the little tiny boxes  must have killed a few  they probably have more than five tigers  that they've produced in their life 
[02:54:30]  so let's  let's do a number equal  to every tiger  sigmund and leeroy  ever produced  there we go  there's all the ones they've produced other times  and what about  all the little bunnies  and doves  and kittens  that they ever pulled out of anywhere  i think we've covered sigmund and leeroy  let's go to the other magicians  doug henning  here's your whole act  and doug  there's your life doug henning  there's every single animal  doug henning  what are you doing with so many bees 
[02:55:00]  let's go with blackstone  you got your  you got your copperfield  you got your first in  you got your kreskin  i know you're thinking kreskin's a mentalist  but i'm sure he pulled a bunny or two in his life  and besides  this bee right here  reads minds  at least as well as kreskin  how about all the amateur magicians  here's the amount of animals  produced by all the amateur magicians  in north america  here's all the scouts  a pot full of bees  all those north america  that counts canada  that counts nexco  how about south america  i think we got south america 
[02:55:30]  here's south america  south america's over here  i made a mistake  south america's now on my hand  dumping bees all over the fucking place  okay we got south america  we got ooh  there's antarctica  every animal produced in antarctica  is stinging me  right next to greenland  and we also got  europe and africa  covered here  europe and africa  europe and africa  and then a couple of bees  we'll put another bee on the barbie  but how about  japan  you want japan  they love livestock in japan  here's japan  china  he popped his bees 
[02:56:00]  fell out of it  they're on his forehead  we don't want to do all one kind of animal do we  there's another kind of animal we want to do too  he's still pouring bees out  he's pouring bees out of cups  out of a hat  a rabbit out of a hat  there's nothing at all scary about a rabbit is there  well how about this rabbit  he opens the rabbit  there's bees in it  he's opening the pot with more bees in it 
[02:56:30]  jesus pouring more bees out  now it's a million bees  now the bees are on the camera lens  secretly Leroy  you are loose  it is your move  in his hair  on his head  secretly Leroy  why is he doing this  try this at home  and he's not being quiet  they're screaming  all right  holy shit  all right listen 
[02:57:00]  wow  I don't know if Penn is up right now  but can we try to get a hold of him  what the fuck  I know a lot of his people listen to this show  if we can get Penn on the phone real fast  I gotta know about that trick  what the fuck that's about  he was yelling  you're supposed to be quiet  a beard of bees  you gotta just kind of hang out  and hope they don't bug you  please don't do this  holy shit  you gotta see that for yourself  just type in Penn and Teller  bees  that wasn't some kind of stunt  hell no  they were all over his fucking face and hair  there's no way that was a stunt 
[02:57:30]  hell fucking no  that is amazing  wow  what does he say in here  much over five  bee stings  but we got all these allergy tests  and we had a nurse standing by  and both Teller and I had EpiPens  around our necks  and we were told how to look at the symptoms  in each other  because the way you die  from bee stings  is you go into anaphylactic shock  and what happens is  your blood pressure goes so low  your veins and arteries 
[02:58:00]  go from  this is the way it was explained to me  I'm probably wrong  I'm sure someone will correct me  you guys are good at that  but it goes from like  you know  whatever size it is  to much bigger  and your blood  even though your heart  keeps pumping  your blood can't move  it  can't move  it's like a stream  going into a pond  was the way it was explained  the pond can't flow  so you suffocate  while still breathing  in your heart  that's anaphylactic shock  so we both had EpiPens  around our neck  which are essentially speed  and the nurse was there 
[02:58:30]  and also gave us speed  and there was an ambulance there  that takes to the hospital  and then we did this bee thing  and we produced like a million bees  and because Teller was producing them  they were flying away from him  and we tried to look into  you know animals  insects that looked just like bees  but weren't  and wouldn't sting  and that didn't work  there was just no animals  we could get like that 
[02:59:00]  and so we ended up using real bees  we used about a million of them  and because Teller was dumping them on me  and because I was trying to keep talking  they would get trapped  in different parts of my body  my neck and stuff  and they would sting me  and during it  and you can see this  it's all over YouTube  I get stung on the roof of my mouth  while I'm talking  and I flicked the stinger  and spit it out  and you know Jane Curtin 
[02:59:30]  who was a guest on the show  remember Jane Curtin  of course you know  she was still on SNL and stuff  she was on a big successful show  after that  that I never watched  and she said that she couldn't believe  how I kept going  after I was stung in the mouth  and I said well you know  if I didn't keep going  I'd have to do it again  so I think that the pussy way  was to keep going  the brave way  would have been to start  and go back to zero  but at the end of the whole thing  I was stung  over 20 times 
[03:00:00]  Jesus  about 25 times  that's actually not that bad  and we had to come out  we had to strip  completely naked  and be vacuumed off  from the bees  vacuumed off  okay  want to vacuum me off  and we had a strip  there was a live audience  we had to strip naked  and be cleaned out of the bees  and then go on  and do the rest of the show  and  why wouldn't that be the closing  we did that  about noon  you're right  and I worked until about  I don't know  midnight or one  on the show  and I went back home 
[03:00:30]  and I was living with  New York City  she was a model  at the time  of course  you know that thing  where you like  you stand in the doorway  of the bathroom  while the person  with whom you're sleeping  like you know  brushes their teeth  and gets undressed  you just kind of chat  you know  and  she was doing  that kind of stuff  you know  she didn't wear much makeup  but maybe I don't know  combing her hair  or doing some  some sort of  ablutions  and  I was standing 
[03:01:00]  in the doorway  exhausted  and just kind of  taking my shirt off  and taking my pants off  when I took my  underwear off  all the skin  of my scrotum  the outer layer  stuck to the inside  of my underwear  I peeled it off  and you might  you might have to  stop watching here  it's going to get  rather graphic  just so you know  I'll give a warning  maybe  alright we got to stop  no  what  no he said stop  I want to hear  he warned us 
[03:01:30]  but oh but he warned  others not us  we're tough cookies  oh  just so you know  I'll give a warning  maybe Sony  will put up a warning  at the top of this  this is not for people  who are squirmish  about bleeding ball sacks  that should be  not for those  who are squeamish  about bleeding ball sacks  so I pulled down  my underwear  and the skin  was stuck to it  not a lot of skin  but like when you have  that sunburn  that peels  like that kind of  tissue paper skin  but underneath  it was just like 
[03:02:00]  raw and red  and my balls  were just  didn't have any of that  like tension in them  you know  now they kind of  yeah  you know what I'm talking about  and so I just do this  and I'm kind of horrified  but I look up  and my girlfriend  is like whatever horrified I am  like you know  by times seven  and I look up at her 
[03:02:30]  and she's looking at me  and I say  William  I have an ectoskeleton  in order to get bigger  I have to molt  you know  was my joke  um  boom  she didn't laugh  so this horrible thing  and she says  let's go to the doctor  right now  and I say  I'm too tired  to go to the doctor  and then I looked at her  and said  and I guess  a blowjob  is not in the question  and then I went to bed  and I got up the next morning 
[03:03:00]  and there's blood  all over my scrotum  and the skin is still gone  and peeling around the edges  so I called my doctor  who was a friend of mine  like I knew him  I was on a first name basis  and stuff  and I called him up  and I said  yo you know all the skins  coming off my  peeling off my ball sack  and he says to me  cool  I want to see it  and I said  well I can't really see it  you can't really see it  because I have to work all day  so I'll try to get in  like tomorrow  or the day after  but I really have to  get this show done  we're doing this show 
[03:03:30]  for NBC  and he said  I know  but you're going to  have to come in  and I said  no I really can't  and he said  put it this way  you either come in  or I will have  the board of health  shut down your show  because all the skin  off your ball sack  you've got to come in  so I went into him  and I sit down  and he says to me  so what's up  and I go  I don't know  just all the skin  came off my balls  and he looks  and he goes  what have you done  different lately  and I said  I don't know  what have you been eating  shellfish  I go no  I haven't been eating 
[03:04:00]  shellfish with my balls  and I  you know  what he said  what do you have to eat  I said  you know  I had a cheeseburger  and I had a pizza  that's all I ate  at that time  that's all I want  to eat now  and  he said  huh  well I got to talk to you  and then he goes over  and he shuts the door  so the  you know  the receptionist  can't hear  and he sits down  quietly  and says  you know  I know you've always  told me  you don't do any drugs  but we have to talk  now because  this is an allergic  reaction  to the impurities 
[03:04:30]  in street heroin  and I say  well no  I'm not doing heroin  I never even had a drink  and he goes  listen  you're done lying  to me  this is impurities  injected into your system  and I said  no  no it's not  and then he has me  roll up my sleeves  you know  and I said  I don't have  I don't have track marks  I don't do drugs  and he's like  really like serious  there's like a whole tone 
[03:05:00]  in the room  that's like the principal's office  it's like total bummer  but it's also  principal's office  coupled with that  like compassion  like you know  intervention  compassion  like I've never seen  that before  but I've seen it in movies  it was like  and I go  no I'm not on drugs  and I'm like  you know  no mom  just give me a Pepsi  I'm not on drugs  you know  what's that  minor threat  they might have to  blip that out  because it's probably  a lyric  but it's like  you know  it's like minor threat  I'm all like minor threat  trying to convince  him I'm not on drugs 
[03:05:30]  and then he's sitting  there going  well it's got to be  something  and then he says  out of the blue  because he'd helped us  with the allergy stuff  well did you do  the bee thing yet  and I said  it wasn't even  on the subject  you know  and I said  yeah we did it  or I guess he said  when are you going  to do the bee thing  and I said  we did it yesterday  and he said  did you get stung  and I said  yeah I get stung  you know  about 25 times  and he said  get the fuck  out of my office  you are too stupid  to have a doctor 
[03:06:00]  you got injected  by 25 dirty  little needles  yesterday  and this is  an allergic reaction  that's centered  on your ball sack  that's all it is  if you just said  on the phone  you got stung  that much  you wouldn't even  have to come in  you stupid asshole  put some cream on it  and get the fuck  out of my office  and then I went  in that afternoon  to do an interview  with CNN  and I said  here's something  for your Christmas reel  and I pulled down  my pants  and showed them  my balls  so somewhere  maybe if you know  a CNN guy  or something  somewhere in their  vaults  with their Christmas reel 
[03:06:30]  there's a shot  of my balls  with all the skin  off it  with the bees  and my girlfriend  at the time  was running around  telling everybody  about what my  ball sack  looked like  and then it stopped  my scrotum  got all better  and then it moved  on to the tops  of my feet  where all the skin  peeled off  and then I was fine  so that's  that's what I'm here  to tell you today  why wouldn't you say  that first  at the doctors  though  I would have called up  and said I got stung  and said my balls  are peeling  yeah that would be  the first thing  right  yeah  you would kind of  make that  I kind of  get the impression 
[03:07:00]  it takes  a teller  or pen  a long time  to tell a story  yeah  holy shit  but he had no pressure  he just had his camera  and he just  to the point  you know  we have the pressure  of trying to get  to the point  yeah  he actually did  a really good  radio show  yeah he did actually  he had a really  good radio show  someone's saying  the story's bullshit  why  Teddy in North Carolina  Teddy  the bee story's bullshit  why is that  they won't make you  swell like that 
[03:07:30]  within the first  five minutes  you'll know  if you're allergic  or not  well maybe it was  an allergic reaction  like I don't know  well it wasn't  the allergic reaction  to the bee sting  is what he was saying  that's different  this is an allergic  reaction  to  like a secondary  thing  from the bee stings  you know  maybe he had gonorrhea  and you know  yeah  this chick is like  what the fuck dude  and he goes  oh the bee  fucking thing  I did yesterday  obviously  I got a 
[03:08:00]  allergic reaction  and losing my  testicle skin  does anybody  work with bees  do that  I mean the video  I do  I like how you  asked that question  like for the people  out there maybe  yes I do  I know  you don't though  I know  here's my dream  in life  I don't know  how this would happen  but then Anthony  goes home  and his house  has a swarm  of bees in it  no  and they're in  his toilet  no I hate bees  and when you shit  they creep out  from under the rim 
[03:08:30]  and crawl into your  hiney and your balls  oh no  oh  and fly up  between your legs  and your face  I hate bees  alright we got a  guy that's gonna  back up that story  Marcus in North Carolina  Marcus  hey what's going on guys  last summer  about this time  I got stung  three times  right around  my waistband  and I was driving  my car  and I didn't realize  it until the  fucking yellow jackets  were stinging me  so I pulled over  got out of the car  well about three days  later I noticed  the swelling  went from my waistband 
[03:09:00]  down towards my penis  man  and it's like  my entire cock  was numb  and you know  how you get out  of the swimming pool  like your fucking  shit just shrinks  well my penis  like my balls  are just shriveled up  man  like you know  the part  I'm circumcised  obviously  well it's like  my foreskin  my penis took  like a left hand turn  and stayed there  for a while  and then  my fucking foreskin  just ballooned up 
[03:09:30]  man  where the doctor  cut it  it just kind of  just ballooned up  are you nervous?  oh fuck yeah  I was nervous man  dude my dad's a doctor  and I called my dad  and I'm like  dad  dude am I alright?  and he's like  yeah yeah  what's wrong?  I'm like  these beasts  man  these fucking bee stings  went to my  the swelling  went to my penis  dude I don't know  what to fucking do  and he's just like  fuck you're alright  dude you're alright  Jesus  yeah it was nasty man  I didn't show my girlfriend  for about a week  man it was  I looked like  a fucking little dwarf  man it was nuts 
[03:10:00]  wow I've never heard of that  that's so fucked up  right on Marcus  thank you  hey here's a guy  here's a guy  who's supposedly  wearing a bunch of bees  right now  Brent  South Dakota  alright  now I got a load of bees  on my truck right now  504 hives  504 fucking hives  how many in each hive?  they estimate about  10,000 per hive  and you're driving  these somewhere  obviously  5 million bees  what  from Texas  to North Dakota 
[03:10:30]  what kind of truck  is it  is it  a closed  like  box truck  how do you keep them  cool or warm  or what  it's a  it's a  step deck  a flatbed  open  open trailer  you  well what if  but the bees  got a fucking  what if they fly up  and then  the hives  are probably closed  they do  we just throw a bee net  over the top  it's just a net  you throw it over the top  and you can't stop  during the day  you just  drive  you know  during the daylight hours  and stop at night  they still get out  wait a minute 
[03:11:00]  so there's a net  protecting them  do they fly away  from the hive  or do they stay  pretty close  they stay pretty close  like if you stop  at the truck stop  or stop over to  pitch or anything  they'll fly out  and you know  you'll lose a few  that way  but otherwise  you just keep  moving during the  daytime  do they sting you  or no  yeah like  some nights  you don't get  stung at all  sometimes you'll  get 10-15  stings  what a fucking  nightmare  fuck that job  why are we just  sitting here  just casually  listening to this guy  your job is to  fucking transport bees 
[03:11:30]  wait you get  stung at night  oh yeah  at night time  daytime  that night  I got stung  while I was  in the fall  where I went  to the sleep  hey do you get  extra money  for transporting bees  yeah they pay  pretty good  alright  better than  the average  load  well how much  do you get paid  to take a load  of bees somewhere  $2.80 a mile  $2.80 a mile  alright how many miles  do you gotta go  uh 1600  wow alright  that's a lot  and yeah  we did not forget  that we had a  listener get stung  in the bowl bed  yeah  do we have that 
[03:12:00]  audio  maybe we go to  break with that  today  you're looking  wow  there you go  Brent  thank you for  that story  I guess they  crawl into  what happens  is some of them  probably fly into  the sleeper  yeah  and at night  he gets in there  and he fucking  lays on one  they get everywhere  those little  fuckers  they fall off  your bee suit  while you're  getting changed  out of  their  right  oh my god  alright man  thank you  we got  Psycho Bob  calling back  from Baltimore  Psycho Bob  yes  actually this is

[03:15:30]  for etiquette  presents  how to  address  a little  person  midgets  midgets  they don't  like that  word  or a  person  of short  stature  first  assume  the proper  stance  bend your  knees  and punch  over at  the lower  back  put your  hands on  your knees  and look  right at  him  scrunch  your nose  and go  hi  next  acknowledgement  of the  subject  they love  having their  hair tussled  they do  love that 
[03:16:00]  and lastly  commence  conversation  but in a  respectful  manner  only talk  to them  in baby  voices  that's how  it is  from now  on  how are  you  and what's  your name  and that  is how you  address  a fucking  midget  sorry  a person  of small  stature  how about the  sausage legs  do they mind  that one  muffin hands  as brought to  you by the  opium anthony  institute  for etiquette  that's right 
[03:16:30]  it's the opium anthony  show in studio  jet jet jet  was by uh  how long ago  well you probably  wouldn't know you  guys do so much  press you wouldn't  know i was like it  was a couple of  years ago a couple  years ago we had  you on in our  other studio and  man you guys were  great thanks what  have you guys been  up to it's been a  while being great  being great just  you probably have  never left the road  since the last time  we saw you guys  we made a record in  austin you made a  record in austin is  that place as cool  as they say it's  pretty great i hear  it's nothing but 
[03:17:00]  really great clubs  and we had a good  time awesome food  you know lots of  great steakhouses  all that sort of  stuff always outside  all the bars are  outside because it's  so hot you know i  think also being  australian is you  know it's you're  from australia  you're from some  place i never even  heard of  that's like a  fight of conquest  something about  austin that we  really that we  i think particularly  identified with  you know yeah  why the weather you  mean or just the  outside i think the  weather creates an  atmosphere as well  you know like it's 
[03:17:30]  kind of a pretty  laid-back place you  know you guys i  think guys the  single right now is  out and uh it's  probably doing very  well well it's uh  is it doing well  here is it out here  or is it just  overseas well it's  uh we're getting  like news in now  because it's been  out for a couple  weeks and it's  doing well we're  getting good news  from japan and  good news from  everywhere are you  guys finding it  easier to get your  music out there now  that the you know  with social networking  and we're sort of  doing the internet  thing so i mean  it's the first time  everyone's very aware  of us you know  there was a time in  rock radio especially  it was really tough to 
[03:18:00]  get your song on the  radio because it was  very strict and it  was ridiculous it was  a few program directors  that controlled the  whole damn thing and  now i think the  reins have been  loosened but they  were all playing the  same kind of generic  music i think for a  while right i think  like you know around  2003 2004 you know  bands like the strokes  and even you know are  you gonna be my girl  and songs like that  sort of i think change  that format in a way and  people started opening  up and playing sort of  more you know varied kind  of records and so well  the cool thing too you  don't have to depend on 
[03:18:30]  the radio stations as  much as what i'm getting  at you kind of push it  out yourselves which is  nice it is nice and it's  the first time we've sort  of really been doing that  online thing for this  record right and you  know there's the twitter  thing and all that sort  of stuff you guys like the  the twitter thing i mean  we're big fans yeah i  didn't i wasn't so into  it at first but um  because i was just like  i thought i don't want  to be so accessible to  everybody but but then  i got really into it  because you know you  learn interesting things  from your fans and  stuff and i never sort  of i didn't see that  so yeah we learn  interesting things all  the time you suck 
[03:19:00]  shut up yeah you gotta  watch it though because  you respond you think  it's a private response  when you send somebody  like an at response you  don't realize it's public  the first time you tell  a girl you have great  tits yeah  your own girlfriend  sees that and you're  like oh i thought  that was private  and i feel stupid  you read some of the  replies and you're like  wait and you're a fan  of our show oh all right  it doesn't look like it  yeah thanks yeah how do  you guys handle the  negative stuff that the  fans can we all get it  i mean yeah does it  really drive you nuts  any any of the horrible 
[03:19:30]  things a fan will say  stupid you know we've  been doing this for long  enough now to just not  care yeah we couldn't  give a shit we're calloused  do you guys travel the  world too where's your  hot spots america or is  there other countries  that really where's your  hot spots japan  actually with our tell  me all about your  hot spots mine is two  fingers deep  we always get like uh the  the south american fans  are so like they're always  telling us to come down  you know and um  unfortunately we haven't 
[03:20:00]  been able to yet  they're south america  violent like a big rock and  roll fan well i've heard  japan in there japan just  seems like a fucking weird  place japan's really  bizarre and they go it's  fantastic it's awesome for  us they go crazy and then  just right after they  finish their applause which  always lasts for around like  three and a half seconds  diarrhea comes out of their  ass and they videotape it  on the web  you know like these weird  polite culture right it's  like they used to think  interrupting the song like  his kiss said they would  play there and it would just  be weird because they 
[03:20:30]  weren't doing what american  audiences they were just  kind of sitting on their  hands watching and enjoying  the show  we thought they hated us  when we first went to then  we realized that they're  actually being really  respectful yeah and  listening they're trying to  listen to what if you speak  after the song so they  clap and then they just  stop and you're just like  what do we suck and yeah  they're just waiting to hear  if you say anything because  they need to listen you know  that's so weird  there's a group think thing  that's going on like they  all act like as one you  know and they do one thing  like they're all like hey  hey and they all have the  same arm up in the air and  doing exactly the same do you 
[03:21:00]  guys finally like now that  with the internet and you  it's like nuremberg sounds  like nazis do you guys  think like an album now or  do you start thinking let's  just get three great songs  because you can kind of  release on itunes a little  bit differently now is it  less pressure to come out  with ten songs i mean we  always put heaps of  pressure on ourselves i mean  you don't want to put  anything out there that's  crap even if five people  are going to hear it you  know because because we it's  you make a record you're  from a different school of  course that's exactly the  opposite of the way we do  business yeah put out  nothing but crap and  hopefully somebody likes 
[03:21:30]  one good day and then four  days fuck them  all right so you're still  thinking album wise like  you're not going out just  releasing song you know  we were talking about this  yesterday we were asked a  similar question and and um  and i think you know it's  changed a lot you know  that's it's almost going  back to the way it was in  the 60s when it was like  singles and you know and  that kind of thing and and  then it all went to albums  and i just think it's a  really it's it's cyclical and  it changes all the time like  with the way that music is  sold or whatever so so what  we do is we try and just  make a really great album 
[03:22:00]  that from start to finish is  is really cool and you can  put it on at a party or in  your car or whatever and  just like enjoy the whole  thing and it could take you  somewhere you know have you  guys grown a park creatively  at all i mean with bands  even great bands it happens  it's like one starts wanting  this and one starts wanting  that and then it's just i'm  so i'm really struggling to  even be sitting on this couch  right next to these two guys  how do you feel about me  yeah the hatred between  band members now they still  get along give them another  year well i'm still like  metallica even they went  through their time where it  looked like they're just 
[03:22:30]  finished and then they kind  of smooth out and work  through it and then just put  out like another great  album we've had our moments  you know don't get a  therapist though for the  band no that was really  awkward when metallica  did it sounded expensive  yeah yeah that guy was  really expensive and then  it turns out he had more  problems than any of them  he was the fucking problem  that whole thing yeah he was  going to get into rock and  roll through like therapy  yeah right exactly  that's what you need in  rock and roll yeah well  we've been crowded in here  all morning so let's get  some music out there for  the people the album is 
[03:23:00]  called shocker rock it's  out uh august 25th right  yeah what do you guys want  to play for us today we're  gonna do the single  acoustic style nice it's  called she's a genius  awesome j  my girl's ready to take  control she just blows my

And you guys are doing,  I know you're doing Boston tomorrow or tonight?  No, actually, yeah, tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night in the back of Atlantic City,  and I know that you guys,  the day the album comes out,  you're doing Letterman, 
[03:26:30]  and then like Fallon a week after that.  So you guys are getting really heavy promotion  for this album.  Hell yeah, it's jet.  How many singles do you have out off the album?  Just one so far.  We released sort of like an internet thing.  You work in KIA?  That's right, yeah.  KIA, and it wasn't really like,  it wasn't released or anything to write it.  It was just sort of like a taster thing  we did for our fans and stuff.  And She's a Genius is the proper first single, so.  So, but what, you're trying to go viral with the KIA?  Mm-hmm.  I guess, yeah, sort of get it out there, you know,  but not do like the full.  Yeah, you gotta try different things, right?  Mm-hmm.  It's nice to be able to do it. 
[03:27:00]  It's like if you want to market something on YouTube  or something like that,  it's like you can get as many hits on that  as you would have gotten views on a video.  I mean, if you can get something...  Well, have you seen that thing?  It's pretty gross.  We made like a supermarket massacre video for it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's pretty, it's kind of gross.  I wish I saw it before you guys got it.  I know.  But I'll check it out as soon as the show's over.  My mom's like,  why do you have to do such disgusting things?  Yeah, normally we all have moms that say that.  I hear that all the time, too.  Yeah.  So do you guys have a... 
[03:27:30]  The website is JetTheBand.com.  People might just go to Jet.com  and they wind up getting, you know...  Pictures of airplanes.  Yeah, fucking Boeing or Airbus.  Yeah, G4 or something.  Also, JetTheBand on Twitter  because they mentioned their Twitter earlier.  Yeah, how many Twitter followers do you guys have?  I don't know.  I don't really...  Do you guys...  Yeah, after this radio show,  I think we might have a few.  You guys want to do another one for us?  Um, yeah.  Let's do an oldie but a goldie.  What do you think?  Yep.  Um...  Oh, you're like... 
[03:28:00]  He's like...  Come on, man.  It's early.  How many hours sleep do you guys get?  Uh, four.  Fuck.  Oh, man.  That's like a whole night's sleep for me.  Yeah.  You'd shit four hours?  I would kill for four hours.  That's because...  Yeah, but that's by choice, though.  He's up fucking alcoholically drinking  until two o'clock  and he has to be in here by five.  Where's the problem?  No, there's not.  Works.  Are you guys partiers still on the road or...  Not really?  I have been so far.  Yeah, like...  We were all like,  let's take it easy,  but then, like... 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  There's always a reason  not to wear it easy, though.  Is there one of you  that you're most worried about  won't show up for the gig?  Like, you know,  in Sabbath it was always Ozzy.  Like, is he going to get up?  Or, you know,  there's always one guy in the band  who everybody's worried about.  We always make it there.  Anyone can be the dark horse in his band.  Change, we rotate  to keep it fresh.  Rotating assholes  that are going to ruin the whole band.  Rotating assholes.  Yeah, that's right, man.  We're going to ruin the gig, man.  You suck.  You fucked the whole thing up.  Why don't we get another song 
[03:29:00]  out of these guys?  Yeah, definitely.  Jed, an oldie but a goodie.  Ah, you're going to be my girl.  Ah, here we go.  One, two, three.

[03:32:30]  Get away  Yeah  Be my girl  Be my girl  Are you going to be my girl?  Are you going to be my girl?  Unbelievable  Your voice is sick  But I'm sure you've heard that a few times  At times  Yes, perhaps  It's pretty alley 
[03:33:00]  Are you mad that these two aren't working as hard?  Because it's an acoustic performance  You know, the tambourine guy  Are you going to beat him up a little bit after this appearance?  Mark used to be right  Because sometimes he wouldn't be needed  Because he wouldn't be playing bass  He'd feel so guilty though  Because he was sleeping in  It was almost worse than coming down  Oh, and you're okay  Guilt alleviation  It's close  Yeah  Because you guys are singing  And playing the hell out of the guitars  And they're shaking stuff  I know they're more important than that 
[03:33:30]  When you guys are doing the real thing  Speaking of which  You're going to be at the Paradise  In Boston tomorrow night  And the Music Box  In Atlantic City on Saturday  At the Borgata  Yeah  You've been to the Borgata?  Yeah  You guys gamble?  No  Not at casinos  I lose  It's not really much of a gamble  When you know you're going to lose  It's a true gamble  Nice  And then after that  It's off to Lansing, Michigan  Yeah, man  It sounds exotic, doesn't it?  Do you want to come? 
[03:34:00]  Oof  What's wrong?  Or Lansing  That's not a bad place  It's just, you know what I mean?  It's like you want to go there  Before you go  It's not a casino hotel, yeah  Yeah, exactly  You go Boston, Atlantic City, then  Yeah, it's like you want to go with Lansing  And then Boston  And then Atlantic City  And then Boston  But whatever  It doesn't matter  You guys sound great, man  The single's really good  Absolutely  Thanks  And the album comes out  August 25th  I'm sure it'll be on iTunes  Same day  Shockerock  Jet  Jettheband.com  And Jettheband on Twitter  Thanks, guys  Thank you  Just a little  Quick break  And we're going to finish up next
