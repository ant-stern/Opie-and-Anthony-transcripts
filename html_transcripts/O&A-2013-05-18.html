<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a "Worst of the Week" segment hosted by Sam Roberts, focusing on the bizarre gift Opie received: a crystal decanter and glasses from Paul Anka, a recent guest.  The hosts speculated on the reasons behind this unexpected, lavish present, highlighting the unusual lack of celebrity friendships in their lives.  This segment also covered a range of other topics including Anthony's predicament of being deemed too old to attend his girlfriend's prom; the hosts’ and Jim Norton's collection of celebrity colognes; Sherrod Small's tales of fighting and knocking people out at the Comedy Cellar; and anecdotes about O.J. Simpson and Mike Tyson, including a personal story about a movie theater confrontation.  Numerous celebrity guests were mentioned as appearing on the show that week: Sherrod Small, Colin Quinn, Tom Papa, Trace Adkins, Penn Jillette, Guy Fieri, and Roger Daltrey.

The show then transitioned into a discussion about prom music, followed by a series of advertisements including Bistrictin, FamousSmoke.com, What'sYourPrice.com, and VSC America.  A surprise in-studio visit from Roger Daltrey of The Who followed.  Daltrey discussed his Teen Cancer America charity and the specific needs of teenagers with cancer.  This was followed by a discussion about Penn Jillette's appearance on Celebrity Apprentice, specifically his ice cream task against Trace Adkins.  Jillette called in to discuss the competition and his ice cream flavor, mentioning his interactions with other contestants like Latoya Jackson and his own charity.  Adkins' past experiences, including being shot by his ex-wife, were discussed, alongside a mention of his ASCO heavy machinery commercial.  Further advertisements for Comedy Central Radio and TheraBreath were also aired.

A subsequent segment focused on a comparison of Trace Adkins and Penn Jillette as Celebrity Apprentice finalists.  The hosts debated who would win, detailing Adkins' numerous injuries (house fire, near-fatal shooting, finger amputation, accidents involving heavy machinery, car accident), charitable work (Wounded Warrior Project, Red Cross), and "man's man" persona, contrasted with Jillette's atheism, a supposed sex dungeon, and less successful ice cream marketing. Listener calls added further details to Adkins' life story and anecdotes about Jillette.  Trace Adkins was in-studio, along with Colin Quinn and Tom Papa.  A call to Barry Williams further enlivened the discussion.  The conversation was frequently punctuated by crude and offensive humor.

A segment featuring Trace Adkins followed, beginning with banter about Jillette’s sex dungeon and moving to Adkins’ Celebrity Apprentice experience and his upcoming album of love songs.  Guy Fieri’s presence outside the studio was noted.  Adkins discussed his experiences grilling with Fieri, his maple macadamia ice cream flavor, and several run-ins with the law concerning firearms and transporting alcohol across borders. He also detailed an upcoming road trip across the US, including plans to visit barbecue joints and Yakov Smirnoff's dinner theater.  A conversation with Colin Quinn followed, discussing their experiences in the comedy industry, past incidents including vandalism and a physical altercation between Quinn and Adkins, and the readily available violent online content.  Quinn also shared his experiences filming *Apocalypto* in Guatemala City.  The segment ended with a discussion of Adkins' five daughters and a plug for his music and tour.

The final segment featured a caller recounting a trip to Guatemala, including finding Mayan artifacts and subsequently discarding them while experiencing severe food poisoning.  The conversation then shifted to the caller’s travels with Jack Vaughn, navigating dangerous roads and encountering pickpockets.  A significant part detailed military trips to Japan and Iraq, focusing on interactions with a military liaison and near-banishment from future trips (potentially due to a misunderstanding or another person’s actions).  Anecdotes from these trips, featuring Nick DiPaolo, Bobby Kelly, and Steve Byrne, were shared.  The segment concluded with stories about Jim Norton's behavior during an Iraq trip, described as both funny and insensitive, and further anecdotes relating to the trips.  Various sponsors were advertised throughout.

It's the Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts.  You know me from the Opian Anthony Show, where we count down all the best stuff that happened this week on O&A.  I mean, you could, I hope by now you know that Opian Anthony is podcasting.  If you go to iTunes and you search Opian Anthony, you'll find the Opian Anthony podcast. 
[00:02:30]  You can also get all the information at SiriusXM.com slash OpianAnthony.  That's got an RSS feed link for all you people who use Androids and don't have iTunes.  Podcast aside, this was a giant week for the Opian Anthony Show.  Anthony with another personal revelation.  Lots of celebrities in studio.  You're talking about Sherrod Small.  You're talking about Colin Quinn.  You're talking about Tom Papa.  Comedians aside, you're talking about Trace Atkins, Penn Jillette, Guy Fieri. 
[00:03:00]  How about Roger Daltrey from The Who?  Yeah, it was a big week.  And it started, well, it ended, I should say.  The week was crazy, and Friday's show was specifically crazy.  I say it started because this is how Friday's show started.  Anthony was running late.  He had slept in.  And so Opi was going at it alone.  I was in studio with him.  But he opened a gift that he had gotten from a guest on the show.  And it was just a very weird experience.  We've been talking this week about how Opi and Anthony don't have celebrity friends. 
[00:03:30]  And a gift from a celebrity shows up at Opi's feet.  Wait till you hear who this gift was from.  It just gets weird here on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I got a package here.  Yes, you do.  Sam.  Jesus, Sam.  Sorry.  That's not what we're talking about.  Jesus, you're better than this. 
[00:04:00]  My gosh.  I don't know.  Look at that thing.  E-Rock brought in a big box.  It was a little gift.  And it was for me.  Who's it from?  E-Rock?  Well, I'm going to open it up on the air.  Is that from you, E-Rock?  No.  Me and E-Rock kind of know who it's from.  But, you know, for the magic of radio, I'm going to do this cold.  This is going to be good.  So I got a big box.  Look at these packages.  They're beautiful.  And the package came from Beverly Hills. 
[00:04:30]  Whoa!  From one of the housewives.  With a little note.  It's like a very silvery package.  The wrapping paper is silver.  It's a very well-to-do ribbon wrapped around it.  Yeah, beautiful.  Like the type of ribbon you save.  It's fabric.  I guess I could fucking take a picture of this.  Take an Instagram before and then after.  And then maybe get one of those split screens going on that everybody loves so much.  Wait, I'll pull out the card.  Yeah.  That's what I'll do.  I'll pull out the card.  I'll put that up there. 
[00:05:00]  Well, who's the card from?  Well, they'll know online before you.  Why wouldn't you share it with the radio first?  Huh?  So you have to tune in online to figure out what the big mystery is?  Yeah, Twitter's way more important than the fucking radio show.  Everyone knows that by now.  I'm struggling with it.  With what?  That fact.  Why?  You don't have numbers?  I got okay numbers on Twitter.  I'm doing pretty well.  I'm approaching 50,000.  Whoa, that's pretty good, man.  It's not about the numbers.  God damn it.  I keep getting everything wrong. 
[00:05:30]  You think I could?  All right, they'll be able to see what this is.  All right.  So I open up the note and it says, Dear Greg.  Did I spell Greg right?  Yes.  Yes.  Which is creepy.  Because I'm a rarity.  I'm a G-R-E-G-G.  Yeah, I know.  Me and I think Greg, Greg Allman?  I think Greg Allman does it that way.  And that's about it.  It says, Dear Greg, what a great way to start the morning.  I really loved it. 
[00:06:00]  And look forward to the next time.  Okay.  With much respect.  It was a guest on the show, obviously.  Who sent a package, a really nice present.  But just to you?  I don't know.  Maybe one's waiting for Anthony.  I don't know.  Are there any more packages?  Oh, you know what?  I know why Anthony doesn't get one of these.  Because he was late.  He wasn't here that day.  Oh.  So this very famous person who sent a really nice gift because he was on our radio show  that day, Anthony was not here. 
[00:06:30]  It's a very famous person.  Very famous.  Yes.  I don't think we'll become like celebrity friends or anything, unfortunately.  I'm assuming it's from Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack?  Kevin Pollack?  Yeah.  Just because he's the only famous person that listens to the show.  I love Kevin Pollack, but I can't imagine him actually sending a gift.  Just sending a gift.  Yeah.  Now he's going to because now he's going to feel guilty.  Kevin Pollack?  Yeah.  I think Kevin Pollack should send a gift.  Uh, no, it's not Kevin Pollack. 
[00:07:00]  Hmm.  This is interesting.  Dr. Steve.  E-Rock knows, so he's out.  Travis, you want to guess?  A very famous guest.  Was it the first time he was on?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, it was the first time he was on?  Mm-hmm.  So what the fuck's he sending gifts for?  I don't know.  Will he be back?  Yeah, he sent a gift.  Yeah, but that doesn't mean that he'll be back.  Oh, yeah, this person will be back, yes.  Okay.  This is a recent guest?  It's Guy Fieri.  He sent me steak knives.  Is it Guy Fieri?  No! 
[00:07:30]  Because I was about to say, that is very desperate.  It's Guy Fieri.  Yeah.  Travis, you got a guess on the big gift?  I'm going to guess.  Paul Anka, but I think Anthony was here for that interview.  Anthony was not here for the Paul Anka interview.  Oh, then I'm going to guess Paul Anka.  And you would be correct, sir.  Why is Paul Anka sending you gifts?  He's Paul Anka.  So once again, dear Greg, what a great way to start the morning.  I really loved it, and look forward to the next time with much respect.  And that next time is next week.  Yes. 
[00:08:00]  What?  I don't know what's going on with Paul Anka.  He really had a good time.  Why the fuck is Paul Anka coming back?  He was just here.  I know.  I don't know.  Because when Roland said it, he goes, I go, why is Paul Anka coming back so soon?  He goes, he really had a good time.  He's been in the business for 70 years.  Yeah.  He hung out with Frank Sinatra, and he now wants to hang out with Opie and Anthony and  Jim Norton.  How does it make you feel?  You've been talking all week about not having celebrity friends. 
[00:08:30]  Now Paul Anka is all on your nuts.  Imagine, fast forward a couple more weeks, I can't get rid of Paul Anka.  Paul Anka.  And this becomes really creepy.  He thinks you, Ant, and Jim are the new Rat Pack.  I know.  What a drop off.  Yeah.  What is he doing?  He used to hang out with Sammy and Dean and Frank, and now it's Opie and Anthony and Jim.  Does that mean he just sits at home now?  Are all his celebrity friends dead, so he's trying to make new ones?  I don't know, man.  I think it's really cool, but it's a little strange.  You'd think he could hang out with musicians. 
[00:09:00]  He'd still be in the scene.  Right.  Do you know what's in the box?  I do not.  I'm thinking it could be the cologne.  That's what I would guess.  I would guess a severed head.  So Jim didn't get a gift?  You know what?  I mean, not to spoil it, but I think he did send Jimmy the cologne.  Oh.  So I'm assuming this is my cologne that he promised me as well.  That is quite a big...  He'd send you a giant bottle of cologne.  It's like two liters.  Yeah.  What is it?  It's called Cove? 
[00:09:30]  Cove Collection?  Cove, maybe?  Cove, probably.  Oh, yeah.  Cove.  I don't know why Cove would be your first guess.  It's called C-O-V-E.  I'm going to figure out how to read eventually.  You just wait.  Yeah, it's a giant...  Of course it's Cove.  I don't know why I just said Cove.  It's a giant bottle of Cove cologne.  The box is probably nine inches tall.  It's really heavy.  Like, this is ridiculous.  I'm not bringing this home.  It's a giant crystal bottle.  You shouldn't say on the air, you're not bringing it home. 
[00:10:00]  No, I'll bring it home, because, you know...  It's Paul Anka.  He's coming back anyway.  He can say whatever we want.  What the fuck?  Look at this thing.  It's like really nice crystal.  Look at this shit.  That's just the top.  Look at this.  The top of the bottle is wrapped separately in like a protective wrap to make sure it doesn't  get ruined.  And then there's another fucking package here.  Oh my God.  This is just the empty container.  It's just...  He sent you just a crystal bottle to put your Cove in. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  I'm going to have to do a before and after.  I got the gifts unwrapped, and then I'll have a picture of them wrapped as well.  So that's the cologne, I guess, in the other box.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  And what?  You got to now pour the cologne into the canter?  Wait.  No.  That's not cologne.  What?  He sent you like a bottle and glasses.  Like that's for putting whiskey in.  Wait.  I don't get fucking cologne?  No.  He sent you like a...  Maybe that's why he's coming back. 
[00:11:00]  He's going to hand deliver it to you.  These are very nice though.  I'm looking online.  It's a very nice gift.  That's like in Mad Men when they had the cart.  Yeah.  With like the drinks.  I got a Cove crystal decanter.  Look this shit up.  Maybe we can resell it.  Let me check it out.  It's about $100.  It's about $100 right there.  And then, okay, I get it.  And then really nice crystal glasses.  Yeah.  It's a drinking set.  Dude, this is a really, really nice gift.  We should save them.  I'm going to a wedding soon.  This is going to be perfect.  Yeah.  Wrap that shit back up. 
[00:11:30]  I'm going to wrap this shit.  This is like a perfect wedding gift.  Why did he send you that?  It's Paul Anka.  I don't really drink.  That's the problem.  See, you know why this is a risk when celebrities do it?  What do you put in this decanter?  It's not like a wine decanter.  I think whiskey.  Juice.  Like whiskey or gin.  Yeah.  Maybe a nice vodka.  But now, when Paul Anka was first coming in, the idea was, holy shit, Paul Anka's in 
[00:12:00]  studio with us.  Now, it's like, what's Paul Anka doing?  Why is he giving you gifts?  Does this make you feel like you think less of him, right?  It completely strips away his famous guy, Mystique.  Right.  I don't think Elvis was walking around giving gifts out like this.  Or they'd be weird.  To like radio nobody.  Yeah, exactly.  He wasn't sending disc jockeys decanters.  Holy fuck.  That's like, geez, Paul, relax.  Yeah, we'll have you back on.  It was a book interview.  Dude, I want to break this so bad. 
[00:12:30]  I'm getting that urge.  How funny would it be if Paul Anka came back in and you could pretend it was a mistake,  but you could announce you're going to do it.  Yeah.  And say like, oh, you gave me this great cove decanter and then you dropped it and shattered  it in front of his face.  That is fucking really nice.  Now it's going to be awkward.  I got to thank him and stuff when he comes in here.  Holy shit.  He's coming in next week.  Yeah, but I wanted the cologne.  That's all I wanted.  The decanter is $100.  Really?  Yes.  Taillights, taillights, taillights. 
[00:13:00]  Break, break, break.  Yeah.  The traffic at a little later.  It's fucking astounding.  Astounding.  Yo, if I don't get another cup of coffee, I'm going to flip some shit.  Uh-oh.  Get the boss some coffee.  I'm going to throw some fucking crystal.  I don't know if they're...  Paul Anka.  The guys get coffee.  They'll make a fucking maniac out of me.  He's coming back.  He's coming back.  Why?  He had that good a time.  If you remember, I missed that appearance.  Yes, you did.  I was ill-fated at the time. 
[00:13:30]  We did all right, man, with Paul Anka.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We did all right.  But now...  We had a good time.  It's all a hat to you.  You guys are pals.  Right.  And now I'm going to be the guy that's like, holy shit, it's Paul Anka.  Right.  And if you played right, you might have some fucking crystal in your future.  I know.  I see that.  I just want a cologne, though.  You just want a cologne.  It was a throwaway.  We like...  Me and Jimmy go, wow, you smell really good.  Me and Jimmy, we're on the same page with colognes.  Yeah.  And we love collecting the celebrity colognes that come in here.  Sure. 
[00:14:00]  And we got something from D.L. Hughley.  Mm-hmm.  And then who came in here smelling really good?  And Jimmy went out and got the cologne.  Ozzy.  No, someone actually gave...  Oh, left the cologne here.  Was it Donald Sutherland actually said, well, it's this cologne, and just gave Jimmy the  rest of the bottle.  But then asked for it back later.  Did he come back for it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he wanted it back or something.  He kind of wanted it back.  And then I guess Paul Anka sent Jim Norton his actual cologne.  Oh, he did. 
[00:14:30]  Or the cologne he uses.  So I was assuming it was my cologne, finally.  But no, I get the crystal.  This is like one of these must-be-here-to-win-prize things.  I don't get the prize.  He's probably bringing the cologne with him on the second trip for you.  Oh, maybe.  I sure hope so.  He sent it to Jim already.  That would be wonderful.  What is he promoting?  Nothing.  No way.  Friendship.  There's no way he's just coming back.  He just came out with a book like two weeks ago when he was in here.  Yeah, yeah.  What could he possibly be promoting?  The book again?  Yeah, maybe he's just saying you could still buy the book. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  I mean, I have no, you know...  You should go back and listen to the interview.  I'm sure he had a great time.  Right.  You should go back and listen to the interview.  Yeah.  And then ask the exact same question.  Oh, my God.  I probably wouldn't even have to listen to the interview.  It would just be what I felt, you know, I would ask, too.  We're usually on the same fucking circuitry here.  Yeah, what?  Tonight Show theme.  Fucking the guys get shirts.  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  My way.  You talk about that.  My did it my way.  The Rat Pack.  You did it all, brother.  Yeah.  So I don't even know why he's coming back. 
[00:15:30]  So what the fuck are we going to talk about?  Talk about that heavy metal album he put out.  Oh, yeah?  I want him to maybe sing a song for us.  Paul.  Would our audience appreciate that?  I don't even know.  They'd have to.  We would.  It's classic.  Yeah, tell him he's got a buffet.  Okay.  How would we do it?  He doesn't have his band.  He could play the track.  He doesn't do karaoke.  How about we...  Fucking anchor.  Yo, where's my coffee?  Holy shit.  Whoa.  I'm just waiting, boss.  Sway, boss.  You would make a good crony. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah?  He'd be a good crony.  So why don't we sing with Paul Anka?  He's not a flunky.  He's a crony or a henchman.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He could be a henchman.  That dude doesn't fuck around.  No fucking way.  I know.  Our security guy.  Well, fuck that.  I want to talk about Paul Anka.  Paul Anka.  Could we sing with Paul Anka?  Dude, that would be a dream come true for me.  I would break out the golden voice for Paul Anka.  You would?  People have been waiting for it.  All right.  Regrets.  I had a few. 
[00:16:30]  You've got to harmonize a little more.  Then again, too few to mention.  Or I would have to know all the words.  That's true.  Could you write all the words down?  Could you do a little study in?  You could just go...  You know, you could do that.  Yeah.  Sing that part.  Yeah.  What a weird hour.  It was weird.  This is a weird hour.  Very strange.  It was weird.  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  Worst of the week countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:17:00]  You can also hear my show, the Sam Roberts show, Sunday, 4 p.m. Eastern time, here on  the Opie and Anthony channel.  A lot to get to still.  Roger Daltrey from The Who was in studio this week.  That was amazing.  As was Penn Jillette and Trace Atkins and Guy Fieri, Colin Quinn, Tom Papa, a whole bunch  of people.  Before we get to any of that, Sherrod Small was in studio.  He's on a new show on Fuse called The United States of Hip Hop with friend of the show, 
[00:17:30]  Mashup Nicole.  Nicole from The Morning Mashup is hosting a show on Fuse with Sherrod Small.  It's called The United States of Hip Hop.  And it's on Tuesdays at 8.30 p.m.  He was hanging out.  He's one of the comedians who's at the Comedy Cellar with Jim Norton all the time.  And they ended up talking about all the fights that he gets into.  Apparently, he can knock a motherfucker out.  I don't know what that's like.  But he'll tell me about it right now.  And here's what convinced me that he did it, too, besides the evidence, was that he said 
[00:18:00]  that if I did it, maybe Ron Goldman would have gotten into a judo stance.  And you know that's what happened.  OJ came over, freaked out.  and I think  Goldman Ply got into a karate stance  and OJ just killed him.  He went ballistic.  That guy was there to fuck Nicole.  That's what I think.  He just went crazy as a man.  He couldn't handle some younger guy fucking his wife.  It really is an unbelievable amount of evidence.  When you just look at it on the outside 
[00:18:30]  and go like, okay, here's this guy.  He's with this fucking blonde.  He's fucking her.  And then you get this little  fucking young snot-nosed guy  that comes in. OJ must have fucking been real pissed.  And the kid was probably more arrogant about it.  Again, I don't know.  There's kind of like the story with  Mike Tyson. Mike Tyson told us a story  about going over to Robin Given's house  and Brad Pitt was there.  You would think Mike Tyson would be the dude  who killed somebody, not OJ.  How is Mike Tyson coming off 
[00:19:00]  reasonable?  Oh, Brad, I love you in 7.  It was great. What was in the box?  Did he say Brad  was a fucking  mellow, really mellow about it?  I forget how he said Brad.  He was scared.  Of course.  You don't want to make any fast movements.  It's like, yeah.  You know, Robin Given was like,  what you going to do about it?  This ain't yours no more.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  How great was that one-man show?  You saw it, obviously.  The Mike Tyson one-man show?  You haven't seen it.  He tells that story. 
[00:19:30]  Brad, why don't you tell him  to get his black ass out,  this motherfucker?  Robin, shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Let me get out of here.  That's how girls get you beat down.  Oh, man, yeah.  They know how to do that shit.  Yes.  I'm not shutting up here.  I told a story about it  in the movie theater  when that happened with me  and my chick a long time ago.  Uh-huh.  Sitting in the movies  and there's a whole row  of a Hispanic family  behind us  and one woman 
[00:20:00]  just wouldn't shut the fuck up  and my chick is just like,  I don't fucking want to shut up.  She won't shut the fuck up  and she turns around and goes,  my chick just goes,  would you shut the fuck up?  And I'm like,  oh.  She just went,  excuse me?  And the guy that was with her  just went,  oh, man,  you just put her in battle mode.  I'm like,  oh, no.  Oh, battle mode.  Oh.  I just wanted to see,  like, Mission Impossible 2,  I think it was.  How did that end up again? 
[00:20:30]  Well, I...  You defused the situation  because you're here.  I bravely got the usher  to take us out of the theater  and put us in another show.  Oh, really?  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's hilarious.  I was not going to fucking  deal with the Diaz family  for the entire movie.  Not right behind you, too.  Yeah, yeah, right behind me  because Hispanics,  very good with knives.  Yes.  And I don't like the idea  of being front.  Yeah, so we just,  I was like,  yes, okay, honey, 
[00:21:00]  let's go, let's go.  We showed that.  We're leaving the theater.  Yeah.  It would have been great  if they were to just  American meat stab you  right there.  Yeah, right?  Just one of those  quick fucking  rapid fire shankings.  It's not even a stabbing.  It's a fucking shanking.  Did you get,  did they say anything  on the way?  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The fucking bitch was like,  yeah, you keep walking,  keep walking.  She was fucking pissed.  My chick,  and I just fucking  laid into my fucking chick.  I'm like,  what are you,  out of your fucking mind? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  You don't do that shit.  Girls will get a guy  beat up so fucking fast.  Us as guys,  we know,  we know what to say,  what not to say.  If a fight comes up  and we got a fight,  we know that point.  Right.  But before that happens,  there's a whole dance  that goes on.  Right.  And there's a way  that you could both  leave the situation  and save face.  With your pride.  Right.  If your bitch  starts mouthing off  to the guy,  now you gotta stand up  for your chick.  Right. 
[00:22:00]  And he's gotta be pissed  at you,  because you got  a loud mouth bitch.  Now you're fucked.  Ladies,  shut the fuck up.  Y'all both should have  stood up and punched  both your girls in the face.  shake hands,  watch the movie together.  Look at this shit.  It's fucking great.  Thank you, man.  Yeah.  Both girls laid out.  Yes.  Patrice told a story  about that,  where his chick,  Vaughn,  was mouthing off  to somebody.  Oh, man.  And Patrice said to her,  to the guy,  like,  now you have to deal with him.  Now, obviously,  the guy didn't do anything.  Right, right.  But Patrice said something 
[00:22:30]  to the guy about it.  Like, he was so annoyed  that she had put him  in that position.  That's a good thing  to diffuse.  Yeah.  Now you deal with it.  I'm gonna watch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, what do you want me to do?  I didn't do this.  Go wrestle him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You chick doesn't seem  like she does that, though.  No.  She wouldn't push it off  on me like that.  Yeah.  She's usually trying  to calm me down  from choking somebody  in a drive-thru.  Yeah,  Sherrod has a bit  of a reputation.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, really?  Yeah, as being a guy  who's cement-handed.  I don't like injustice.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  I'm fighting injustice out there.  On the fucking line  on the drive-thru line.  Yes.  A lot of injustice  going on in that loudspeaker.  There's been a few  of those stories  where you come in  on a Tuesday,  like, what are you  on Sunday?  What happened?  No, Sherrod knocked  somebody out  in front of the cellar.  Holy shit.  For what reason?  One time,  some dude acting crazy  outside the cellar.  Right.  The crowd's coming out.  People saying,  great job,  thanks for the show.  Some dude has grabbed  his girl's bra top  and pulled it off.  Oh, shit.  Pulled it off.  And the guy  she was with  was a little dude.  Oh, man. 
[00:23:30]  And I was like,  yo, what the fuck?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  The guy was like,  what you gonna do  at Smash?  Wow, really?  Wait, was the guy  in the audience  or no?  No, he was just  walking by.  That's what you do, too.  And it turns out  the guy who I knocked out  that time,  he worked for Noam.  He was a bartender  around the corner  at the Village Underground.  And he fucking  pulled a girl's shirt.  Was he drunk?  Yes.  He was on something.  And he was with  like two other dudes.  Holy fucking,  just pulled a bra.  I like that whole thing.  It was like rapey.  And you decided  I gotta knock this guy out.  Yes, because I saw 
[00:24:00]  the guy she was with  and he was like,  I...  Oh, wow.  Talk is for movies, too.  Talk is for the movies.  I like that.  What you gonna, bam!  And his boy was  pulling him away  to Ben's Pizza  trying to put water on him.  It was great.  Yeah, that's fucking awful.  I also feel bad  for the little nebbishy guy  that she's with.  Like, how familiar.  Right?  Yeah, he was in  a no-win scenario.  That's why the dude  was acting even bolder  because he saw  that he had a win  with the short dude. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  But then, even after that,  he's gotta look at you  and be like,  oh, man.  In the end,  he's still humiliating you.  His chick is looking  and going,  ooh, ooh, ooh.  Strong, man.  My hero.  My shish kebob.  My hero.  Oh, shit.  You knock out  a lot of people there,  Sherrod?  Nah.  Nah, just here and there?  Just here and there.  The ones that deserve it.  I probably got knocked  more than I knocked out,  but...  I saw you one time  getting pulled out.  There was a big argument  in the hallway 
[00:25:00]  of the fucking cellar.  You walked down the steps  to walk into the right  of the room  and there was some  big, bald guy.  He was a big dude  and you and him  were being pulled apart  and he said something.  I don't know if he said  anything racist,  but he said something  that really put you  over the edge  and you probably  don't even remember.  He said Godfrey was funnier.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  But I forget what it was,  but it was the only time  I ever saw you  in a real rage  trying to get to that guy.  Wow.  And it wasn't fake  I want to get to him,  it was real  trying to get to him. 
[00:25:30]  Fake I want to get to him  where you don't want  to get to him?  Yeah, where you're allowed  to shit to hold you back.  Your boys let you go,  but you back up into him.  Yeah!  Fucking kick your ass!  A 12-year-old's  holding you back?  It's not worth it.  I remember one time  I broke up a fight  at the cellar  between Kevin Brennan  and Greg Rogel.  Yeah.  And they were going at it  and they knocked Esty  to the ground  in the hallway.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Yeah, I remember you.  Yeah, it was real.  I wasn't there,  but I remember hearing  about them scrapping  or what was that?  Rogel's got anger, buddy.  Yeah.  But what was that  problem about? 
[00:26:00]  Did it ever come out?  You never know.  It could have just been  sometimes guys working  in the same situation  night after night  for years.  Just something gets said.  I mean, I really  never found out.  Yeah, something got said.  I think they were  talking about a joke.  Maybe, yeah.  Jesus.  And the next thing I know,  Rogel was on Kevin's neck.  Like, digging in his neck.  Yeah, wow.  Bleeding, his neck bleeding  as he's on the ground.  Holy shit.  Wow.  And I see Rogel all the time.  He's such a mellow guy.  He's sweet.  Yeah.  Artie likes to knock out  people too, man.  Yeah, Artie Foucault.  I've seen two fights  in him, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  One in Atlantic City  and one outside the cellar,  matter of fact.  Yeah.  He went at it.  I saw him go outside  the cellar before.  Holy fuck.  Smashes the kid.  And he does it all...  But the kid started  with Artie.  But he does it  with a smile on his face.  That's what's creepy  about him.  He keeps smiling  the whole time  as he's knocking people out.  He's a mouth breather.  Holy fuck.  Jesus.  Keith wants that reputation,  but Keith is just  old man, Philly anger.  Like, something will happen  and Keith will be like,  ah, play it,  and just hit himself.  It's all...  Ah, you know what it is. 
[00:27:00]  I showed that motherfucker.  Yeah.  You ever know the swirl?  Exactly.  He's just an old  wine-drinking drunk.  He is an old wino.  Keith used to fight a lot,  but now he's just  fucking Grady  from San Francisco.  Just getting sauced.  But Keith had a reputation,  too, though.  There was some guys...  Yeah, you could tell.  Yeah, I mean...  Keith is old school.  He'd fight cops.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's that kind of dude.  I fight cops.  Yeah, yeah.  He'd have one on each arm 
[00:27:30]  and not one on each leg.  Oh, motherfucker!  Put me down!  Yeah, there's a story  with Kevin Hart and him  when they got pulled over  for some, you know...  And I was with Keith  once when we got stopped.  It was me, Keith, Patrice,  and it might have been  Kevin, too,  when they lived in Woodbridge.  I think I was the only  white guy in the car.  Excuse me, I noticed  when you were driving  you were black.  Yes, sir.  I was driving.  Oh, you were.  They said,  are you okay, sir?  Yeah, exactly.  And you picked him up  at 7-Eleven.  We had a hoffed it  situation.  They said,  where's your precinct officer? 
[00:28:00]  And, yeah,  I think it was,  I believe it was when...  Didn't they all live together?  Kevin, Patrice,  and Keith, I think,  lived...  So I was driving back  to Woodbridge,  and we got stopped.  We were just sitting  in the parking lot  talking.  And cops came over.  And, again,  we weren't doing anything,  but I...  The car wasn't moving.  It was just parking.  No, I think we were just...  We were in a nighttime  parking lot,  four guys.  That is kind of suspicious.  And they came over,  and...  They thought Jimmy 
[00:28:30]  was with a tranny.  Three of them.  Two really hot ones  and a little short  passable one.  And fucking...  They came over,  they asked me,  what are you guys doing?  And, you know,  it would have been  very quick.  Like, all you guys say is,  ah, you know,  we just came back  from the comedy club  and then cops immediately.  Oh, but, you know,  Keith was like,  ah, what, we just...  You know,  he immediately gets...  Oh, my God.  And I'm like,  Keith, shut the fuck up, man.  This is my car.  Like, you know,  I don't want to get...  I'm the one  who's going to get a ticket  or get the, 
[00:29:00]  you know, whatever.  Yeah, he's the worst.  I thought we'd take care  of it right here  in Brainerd.  Exactly, yeah.  Fucking Buscemi  and his partner  handled the police  better than fucking  Keith and Patrice did.  So what happened?  They went away eventually.  I mean, we just talked to...  But Keith made it a little...  He made it a little tougher.  And I think...  I'm trying to think.  I don't remember  how Patrice handled it.  I don't remember  how he was.  He probably got you guys  Kevin would have been  the most reasonable  of those three guys.  Really?  Yeah.  Because he can slip  out of handcuffs?  Yeah.  And he's cute  and pixie-ish 
[00:29:30]  and now he's not.  But now he's just rich.  Oh, that's fucking funny, though.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.  On the Colt Anthony Channel.  No labels.

But the show  that you're listening to  is the worst of the week countdown  where we count down  my favorite moments  from this week's  Opie and Anthony shows.  Still a lot to come. 
[00:34:30]  Trey Zatkins,  Guy Fieri,  Penn Jillette,  Colin Quinn,  Tom Papa,  Opie reigniting a friendship.  You know how he's always  talking about building bridges?  He tries to build another one  before we get to any...  Roger Daltrey from The Who.  Roger Daltrey  from The Who  was in studio this week.  Okay?  But first,  I want to talk about Anthony.  You know on slow news days,  they've said it a hundred times,  on slow news days,  sometimes Opie and or Anthony  reveal personal things  about themselves, 
[00:35:00]  things that have been  on their minds,  dilemmas,  ridiculous stories  that they normally  would never say  in a public environment.  However,  it's a slow news day  and they've got to  fill up this airtime.  So what happens?  They air their dirty laundry  for all of America,  most of Canada,  and I've heard a few people  in Australia  to hear all of it.  Wait till you hear this one.  Anthony's always good  for a goddamn  insane person story.  Anthony's got drama  with his girlfriend.  It's not drama  between him and his girlfriend,  but it's what he calls 
[00:35:30]  a dilemma.  Anthony and his girlfriend  problem.  Here on the  Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number six.  I got a personal dilemma.  You do?  What?  It's not really a dilemma  dilemma,  but it's...  No, no, no.  They're working on the pool.  It should be okay.  But, well, you know...  What is your dilemma?  It's not a big...  Well, you know,  there's an upcoming function 
[00:36:00]  that I'd like to go to...  And drink.  No, no, no.  It has nothing to do  with drinking.  I had a dream about you  last night.  Did you?  Was it good?  Was I drinking?  No.  You weren't drinking.  Wow.  I don't dream about you often.  This one was weird.  You were eating...  Cock?  No.  Exactly.  I was in a wake dream.  My dream.  You were eating  giant bricks of cocaine.  Not even...  Not even snorting? 
[00:36:30]  I was just eating?  And it was a drinking thing  because somehow  we were trying to figure out  if you were drinking  or something  and you were like,  no, I'm not,  but I'm doing this  and it was giant bricks.  I don't know.  That's something.  I don't know what that means.  Damn.  Oh, fucking weird.  It made me laugh  when I woke up, though.  So you got to function.  Everyone's speculating  as to why I'm not drinking.  It's just...  They can't get it 
[00:37:00]  through their head.  Yeah.  I just decided like,  eh, let me see...  See how this is.  First of all,  see if I could do it  because, you know,  for years you hear like,  well, you know,  oh, I could just stop  any time I want  or something like that  and then it's like,  well, can you?  You know,  because I never fucking  even tried.  Well, I'll tell you...  And then I noticed  it's kind of fucking nice  to not fucking feel like shit.  Anthony got tired  of 12-year-olds  coming out of his bedroom  like Jack Waltz  from the fucking...  Believe me, 
[00:37:30]  if drinking  can cause that,  I'd still be putting it down.  So what's the function?  What's the dilemma?  Yeah, what is the dilemma?  Well, there's a function  that I'd like to go to,  but I'm not allowed.  Conjunction junction?  I have to go to...  No, my nice...  Oh, my God.  I can't go to the prom.  Oh, my God.  You're crazy.  What?  Why can't you?  Why aren't you allowed?  I'm too old.  That's really ageist.  Wait, there's an...  It is ageist. 
[00:38:00]  There's an actual age  they put on it?  I'm not allowed  to go to the prom.  They actually put an age  on that?  Yeah.  And you'd want to go?  I would go.  It'd be funny.  I would be...  I don't...  I was going to say mortified.  Yeah, yeah.  Just because it would be  such a weird fucking thing.  I don't care, though.  No, I know you don't care.  Something like that  wouldn't even bother me.  I would care.  Does she want you to go?  Yeah.  Would you have your gun with you?  Probably not.  If it's on a school event  like that, I couldn't...  Wait, would you go to the prom?  I did it when I was...  I was five years older 
[00:38:30]  than my girlfriend,  so I was about 23  and I was embarrassed.  Right around now, though.  No.  You are embarrassed.  Depending on who it was.  But I'm not allowed.  What's the age limit?  I don't know.  I think it's like fucking...  20.  It's probably 21.  25, no.  Probably, right.  That's right.  It's like 21.  Wait, you're officially not allowed.  Officially?  What about when these celebrities  all of a sudden go to the prom?  That's what I thought.  I thought, like,  maybe we could do something  where it was a radio contest.  Yeah, make believe it's a goof.  Oh, you're a giant fan 
[00:39:00]  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Have her make a YouTube video  where she's like,  all I want is Anthony Cumia  to go to the prom with me.  And then I respond to it  and go, all right.  Right.  Wait, she asked  and they said no.  Well, no, she knew the rules.  She knew the rules.  Going in.  It's not allowed.  And you're bummed?  Well, it would have been nice.  I think if there's a photograph of you...  That's so strange.  I know you're in a real relationship,  by the way.  That has nothing to do with that.  It's just like  trying to wrap my head around  going to a prom at my age. 
[00:39:30]  Holy fuck,  that's so strange.  If there's a photograph of you  existing with a Lyndon Johnson  campaign button,  they say they will not allow you  to stop a prom.  I like Ike.  That's hilarious.  It's not a dilemma  if you can't go.  No, it's just kind of like,  oh, you know.  It's going to be a drag for her  because she wants you to go.  Who's she going to go with?  Yeah, you know.  Who's she going to go with?  I don't know.  I should probably just bring  fucking...  bring a girlfriend. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, we're here at the sock-up.  Yeah.  It's like the fucking...  There you go.  It's like the fucking...  You know,  the big...  the last big dance.  I didn't dance, though.  The big under-the-sea dance.  Yeah, yeah.  Enchantment under-the-sea dance.  Does she want you to go with her?  She did.  She would have.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, not though.  Wow, and you would have.  I could go over 
[00:40:30]  to the parents' house  and pin on the corsage  as the father  throws himself out the window.  Yeah.  Yeah, you could just see  both of the parents  standing on the roof  like the fucking maid  in the omen.  Fucking hang themselves off.  Wow, you got balls.  Why?  I don't know.  Is that balls?  Yeah, I can't wrap  my head around it.  No, it's just fucking...  What are you going to do?  Look, I got an age difference  obviously in my relationship 
[00:41:00]  but I can't imagine going...  I didn't even come close.  I can't even imagine  going to the prom.  What are you going to do?  It's fucking, you know...  No, I'm not faulting you  or any of that shit.  It's just, you know...  I can't imagine it  because I couldn't imagine  going to it when I was  in high school.  I couldn't either.  The idea of that  would horrify me at any age.  I would just talk  to the teachers.  Yeah, of course.  Like, hey, how you doing?  Yeah.  You guys didn't go  to your proms?  No.  I went to my one girlfriend, Tina,  when I was like 22 or 23  and she was a junior.  That was the biggest thing. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  That would have been great  if you were having  a conversation  with the teachers  and they were like,  oh, so...  What are you...  I'm actually here with her.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I'm here with her.  Oh, what?  What?  Or if she did  the YouTube thing and...  What a creep.  How do we get you  into the prom?  There's got to be  like a little workaround.  I don't think there is.  She's got to do the...  Like, you got to seem  like you're a celebrity  who's going  because she's a fan.  Right.  And then you show up  at the prom  and people are like,  oh, that's so sweet.  He's here, you know.  And then you guys  just start passionately  making out 
[00:42:00]  with tongue at the table.  Yeah.  Suck faith, right, Sam?  Yeah.  I brought an 18-year-old  to my 30th high school reunion.  I love you for that.  It was great.  Were they happy to see her?  No.  But Jimmy,  you wouldn't be able  to do that, right?  Oh, fuck yeah.  You'd be able to do that,  I wouldn't be able  to do that.  Yes.  I couldn't go around her  but bring a younger girl  around my people.  That was fantastic.  In a second, right?  Fuck yes.  That's funny.  All the women,  they were fucking 
[00:42:30]  just so disgusted  and annoyed.  But that's exactly  how they felt  about me in school, too.  So it didn't really change.  You just,  you are the,  they see you  as the repulsive shock jock.  Yes.  Exactly.  Great.  Exactly.  The guys were cool, though.  Of course they were.  They didn't fucking care.  Without a doubt,  I would do that  but I wouldn't go  to her thing.  I couldn't.  Oh, I would in a second.  It would just be  fucking great.  I wear my video glasses  and get everybody's  response, reaction. 
[00:43:00]  Why don't you like  try to be part of the band  or something?  Ah, that would have been good.  If I just go in  and sing a few songs.  Yeah, look up the band  and see if you could  like do a guest spot.  I could sing this one.  Yeah.  This is oldies to them.  This was a great moment.  This is an oldies song.  This might as well be  ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-dang.  This song could be  30 years old.  Yeah.  Oldies to me.  What year did this come out?  I'm going to get  85?  87?  Or Spandau Ballet?  How do you say it?  Spandau Ballet.  Spandau Ballet, right? 
[00:43:30]  Do you remember  the Office Christmas special  when this was playing  at the Christmas party?  Fuck, the music was good  in that show, man.  She was born in 95,  so that's, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  She was born.  This is like me  listening to Jefferson Airplane.  Yes.  She was born a year  after we started  doing radio together.  Oh, my God.  Remember the jokes  people used to make?  It's like,  hey, you chick born yet?  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  Like, when you got,  when we were kicked  off the air in 2002, 
[00:44:00]  she was settled.  Oh, yeah.  I would love that.  Didn't she call me?  Jesus.  Wish me some, you know,  good luck.  Hope you get another gig.  There's got to be a way  to get into that prom.  There has to be.  That song was released  in March of 1983.  83, so there you go.  It just passed 30 years.  30 years.  That's a good song, right?  Oh, this is the slow dance.  I know it's me.  I know it's me. 
[00:44:30]  I know you win.  I know you win.  They don't play these songs  at prom anymore.  They don't?  No.  I don't tell them  a little why.  Yeah, no, they don't play these songs.  What do they play  for slow dancing, though?  They'll play like,  what would be a slow?  What's a good lady's choice, Sam?  What was a slow song  at your prom,  even though you're  an old guy now, too?  Yeah, even now,  it was over.  I love your fucking  youthful exuberance  in the rearview mirror.  Do you look back  through that fucking  ridiculous hair, dude?  It happens to all of us.  It certainly does. 
[00:45:00]  It's humiliating.  And it's wonderful  to see it happen  to somebody else.  I love old apple cheeks.  I'm not trying to get candy  out of his head anymore.  No, not at all.  Nope.  Steve really was all in  on that bit.  Yeah, of course he was.  I respect Steve for that.  Yes, candy out of the head.  He tried all different ways.  He was so passionate.  Yeah, what was your prom, Sam?  Um, did you go with  the black rodeo prom?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Oh, man.  They allowed that?  But I can't go? 
[00:45:30]  This is crazy.  Did people give you guys  shit at all or not?  I mean, she didn't hear  anything?  Of course not.  No.  I guess they look at you  like that.  What are they, fucking Selma?  No, no.  People make, ask anyone  who's been in an  interracial relationship.  Where were you at the time?  Where did you live?  Here's Rochelle.  Westchester.  Yeah, that ain't gonna  fucking, no one's gonna  do anything in New Rochelle.  All accepting, everything's  nice and lovely.  Black people, I mean,  you don't give you  Oh, that's what I mean.  Everyone, everyone.  Black people, uh, don't like  it more than white people. 
[00:46:00]  Especially the bitches.  Black bitches do not like  seeing other black bitches  with white dudes.  It pisses them off.  No, what pisses them off  is seeing black men  with white women.  Black men with white women.  They don't care who  are the black women.  But they look at the bitch,  no, they look at the women too  and be like,  mm, mm, mm.  They look down on them.  But yeah, you're right.  Seeing black men  with white women,  oh boy, does that  piss them off.  You know what would have  been a big, like,  slow dance prom song?  For you?  Around when my prom was?  What? 
[00:46:30]  Amaze.  Oh!  How'd you go?  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Right, yeah.  I mean, probably not  for my prom,  because I went to  a very ethnic high school.  Uh-huh.  So not so much  for the country music.  Did that affect  your choice in women?  Because, like,  the dating pool  was a little, um,  dark?  I don't know,  because Jess went  to my high school too,  so.  Oh, man.  Was she dating black men?  No.  It's a good song, right?  Good girl.  It is a good song.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[00:47:00]  Bring back Jill Nicolini  memories.  Yeah, what happens  if they play this song  at the prom?  You can't start thinking  about your ex at the prom.  Why are they playing  this oldie?  True.  They'd be like,  what's this?  Ew, turn it off!  Yeah, you gotta start,  like,  you'd be upset, though,  because there'd be  a lot of black people  music at this prom.  Oh, there would be.  A lot.  I bet there'll be  twerking going on.  I wonder if they'd  play Shots.  Shots?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lil Jon would have  some kind of representation  in the prom.  Shots, 
[00:47:30]  the biggest new  fucking drinking tune  ever, he said.  It's true.  Isn't that song?  It is a great song.  Huge, that song.  Yeah.  He's put out a few  massive...  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know that song.  Let's hear Shots.  You know Shots.  Oh, man.  I was just getting to the point  where I put my cock in.  Finger on it.  Everybody's lifting  their shots up.  Yeah.  I love this.  He's just, like,  yelling.  All the alcoholics.  Let's get on the dance floor.  Oh, yeah.  That's fantastic.  The worst of the week  countdown on the  O.P. Anthony Channel.

[00:52:00]  The Worst of the Week  Countdown  continues.  Yes, it is.  The Worst of the Week  Countdown with me,  Sam Roberts  from the Opie and Anthony  show.  And, of course,  after Opie and Anthony  live, you can tweet me  at NotSam.  A lot of celebrities  in studio this week.  We had Opie trying to  rebuild a bridge  with a celebrity.  You had Trace Atkins,  you had Penn Jillette,  you had Guy Fieri,  you had Tom Poppitt,  you had Colin Quinn.  Maybe the biggest  celebrity all week.  Maybe the biggest, 
[00:52:30]  one of the biggest  celebrities we've ever  had in studio.  Roger Daltrey from  The Who.  This was amazing  how this all happened.  Roland runs in  during a commercial break  and he goes,  Hey, Roger Daltrey  is right up the hall.  He doesn't say it  quite this eloquently,  but Roger Daltrey  is right up the hall.  Do you guys want to  talk to him for  like five minutes?  Opie and Anthony  are like,  Roger Daltrey,  from The Who.  Roland goes,  Who?  No, he doesn't.  He goes,  Yeah, of course,  from The Who.  Yes, of course,  we want to talk to him.  So Roger Daltrey  just randomly,  as a surprise, 
[00:53:00]  pops by the  Opie and Anthony show.  He's talking about  his charity  and kids with cancer  and stuff.  I mean,  I guess it could have  been a more pleasant topic,  but it's goddamn  Roger Daltrey.  Be happy with what  you get, folks.  Number five.  It's happening.  We just got word,  Roger,  wow,  Roger Daltrey's  coming in here  to say hi.  Who?  Holy fuck.  Grew up listening  to The Who.  Are you kidding me?  Roger D.  Even I like him. 
[00:53:30]  What?  This is really cool.  Look at Travis.  Travis never gets excited.  I'm so excited  if we take a picture  with him.  Holy fuck.  Let's just take  pictures with him.  Who cares?  Can we spend  our five minutes  taking time?  Yeah,  we just want to  spend our five minutes.  Thumbs up.  Here's Roger Daltrey  coming in the studio.  Oh, my God.  He's a big fan of mine.  There he is.  Hi, Roger.  Mr. Daltrey.  Pull up a chair,  my friend.  Good.  Very good.  We want to thank you  for coming back.  We heard you were  leaving the building  and we kind of  chased you down. 
[00:54:00]  He's a busy man.  You already left, right?  You're in the elevator  ready to go.  What are you up to?  Quick, fill us in.  I'm just here  to promote a charity.  What do you got going on?  I'm promoting  Teen Cancer America  foundation that we've  got started over here  that is to help  teenagers with cancer.  Oh, that's a great cause.  Sure.  And it's to do with  changing your system  so that they recognize  that the ages  from 13 to 25 
[00:54:30]  are very different  from children  and they're very different  from adults.  Right.  Telling me.  Do you think  that they're not  screened early enough?  Teenagers tend  to suffer  from very rare cancers,  some of the rarest.  They also suffer  problematically  more late diagnosis  because they're  playing sports  and things like that.  They also  get aggressive cancer.  Cancer becomes  more aggressive  in them  because they're  growing so fast. 
[00:55:00]  So all in all  they suffer  quite,  they've got  a disproportionate  problem rate  with teenagers.  Right.  And the trouble  with the system  at the moment  is that  most of the hospitals  with their  adolescent  and young adult  programs  they go from  the age of  13 to 40  and of course  a 13 year old  and a 40 year old  have got nothing  in common whatsoever.  But we've found  in England  where we've been  doing this  for 23 years 
[00:55:30]  we've built  25 hospital wards  we've got another  10 being built  at the moment.  The evidence  we've got  by isolating  the group  you can  refine the medicine  that they get.  Right, right.  So you get  bigger success rates  in the treatments.  Did somebody  inspire you  to get involved  with this?  Was there something  in your life  that was affected  by it and you said  this is something  we have to do more for?  Well, it was my doctor  that started it  and I just  it kind of 
[00:56:00]  made perfect sense  to me  because it's  nothing to do  with drugs  even though  the end result  will be to do  with how they  use the drugs  this is to do  with providing care  providing  specialist  carers  psychological support  parental support  and environment  because  they think  it's right  that children  should have  teddy bears  in hospitals  you go into  a hospital  and find me  something  that's teenage  friendly  you'll have  to hunt  to find it  so we just 
[00:56:30]  want to change  that thinking  and we want  to make  teen cancer  America  the gold  standard  so that  because every  state is very  very different  in the way  they work  by adopting  that gold  standard  as a program  they can't  hide  if they're  negating  their duty  of supplying  specialist  treatment  for this  specific age  group  does that make  sense to you?  yeah  of course  no it does  absolutely does  screenings happen  when you're a  certain age  like you want 
[00:57:00]  to get checked  for prostate cancer  or whatever  it is  you have to be  a certain age  for that to happen  no no  screening isn't  a problem  but  like I say  oh no  I'm making sure  lots of  lots of  issues  where  boys have gone  in and they've  got a pain  in their knee  and they say  oh  you've been  playing football  yeah of course  I have  oh right  yeah of course  I have  they'll come  back in three  weeks  and they come  back in three  weeks  and they give  them some  anti-inflammatories  or whatever  and it hasn't  gone away of  course  and they give  them some  more anti-inflammatories  they go back  in six weeks  and of course  the guy's in 
[00:57:30]  agony  and it can turn  out to be a  bone cancer  where they have  to  Roger I was a  little hypochondriac  as a kid  I always thought  it was the  worst thing ever  oh my knee hurts  it's got to be  bone cancer  that's what I  always thought  I was a terrible  like I say  this will  this hopefully  will change it  and we've got  we've got  we've got one  unit out in  UCLA  which was the  first unit  there's a hospital  in Seattle  that came to  our 
[00:58:00]  yearly conference  three years ago  in Britain  and they've  copied what  we do in Britain  and they're  going to  I think  going to  adopt our  standard  Yale  are doing  an outpatients  chop down  in Philadelphia  so it's  it's  it's  taking off  people are getting  it  and the parents  are getting it  because there's  nothing worse  than being a teenager  where you're just  coming into those  times where  yeah you can get  laid  oh man  right  you know  you can do all  the things  teenagers do  yeah  and you get 
[00:58:30]  wham with this  one  who doesn't  appreciate a good  teen  right  right  well I didn't  mean it like  that Roger  I just mean  you know  they bring a  certain joy  to the world  right  certain youthful  exuberance  right  finally have  fun  exactly  and then  they're stuck  and to stick  them in isolation  which is what's  been happening  it can have  you know  serious  is there any  way we can  get involved  or  yeah just  look up  teencanceramerica.org  and  donate 
[00:59:00]  and donate  and motivate  the hospitals  the cancer  hospitals  in your  states  and area  to look at  what we're doing  come and talk  to us  how long  have you been  involved in  the states  I've been  banging on doors  for 10 years  and two years  ago I got  lucky with  the head of  UCLA  David Feinberg  who completely  understood it  like I did  when I was  first told  what they were  trying to do  just a bell 
[00:59:30]  went off in my  head that this  made such sense  because most  medicine is  hugely hugely  expensive  relatively this is  really cheap  this is just  organization  and  right  right  yeah  but the  benefits are  huge  so that's  what went  off in my  head  and I just  got lucky  I met  David  and told him  what we were  trying to do  and he got  it  immediately got  it  he sent  the team  over to  Britain  they looked  at what we  were doing  came back  and said  we've got  to have  it  was David  a who  fan  I don't 
[01:00:00]  know  whether he's  a who  fan  I actually  never asked  him that  I mean  obviously  you have  your top  priority  of this  charity  which is  fantastic  but he  had to  have been  like  god damn  who's next  I played  that thing  until you  know  I wore it  out  for Dave  Grohl  and Robert  Plant  and me  we did  a benefit  you know  Robert  Plant  my mate  Percy  we did  a benefit  in someone's  back garden  in Hollywood  they raised 
[01:00:30]  two million  dollars  paid for  the unit  in UCLA  and that's  how we got  the foot in  did you sing  with Robert  Plant  I didn't  do any  no  I'd love  to do an  album  with Robert  Plant  I'm going  to call  him in a minute  you should  do you know  what  you  great heads  of hair  you two  have the  best heads  of hair  I've ever  seen  in rock  and roll  unbelievable  so do you  it's got to  be nice  though  in your  position  where you  know  that people  listen  when you  talk  because  when you 
[01:01:00]  use  all the  years of  fame  to get  something  really good  done  that's got  to be  a nice  feeling  I of course  wouldn't  know  for either  of those  reasons  but I  hear it's  got to  be nice  what else  do you  when you're  not singing  it gives  me another  motivation  in my life  I mean  for the last  of concerts  at the  Royal Albert  Hall in  London  which has  been supported  by most  of the  British  pop bands  like last  year we had  Paul McCartney  for instance  and who  have done  it several  times  more people  have done  it than  not done  it  we do 
[01:01:30]  a whole  week  seven nights  of charity  a week  which is  our biggest  fundraiser  and again  it gives  you a purpose  outside  and the music  business is  great  but it's  not 24-7  it's an  awful lot  of down  time  what the  hell  else  do you  do  did you  get to  a point  where you  get so  successful  where you're  like I  just want  to do  something  not else  but something  good with  all this  because you're  on top of  the world  and it's  like okay  how do I  give something  to people  no I  basically 
[01:02:00]  saw the  link  that without  the support  of teenagers  when we were  in the 60s  none of this  would have  happened  the rock  business  wouldn't be  there without  teenagers  supporting it  right  yeah  well this is  a perfect  vehicle  to get  the music  business to  support  which they  did  and the  comedy  business  in England  and it  just took  off  and by the  end of next  year we're  hoping that  every teenager  that gets  cancer in  Britain  has access 
[01:02:30]  to one of  our facilities  and what's  the website  and stuff  that people  can go  to  teen  cancer  america  dot org  ok  we gotta get  him out  of here  this was  very nice  thanks for  popping out  yeah we're  good to see  you  enlightening  people  sorry I  haven't got  more time  no that's  ok  no it's  all good  man  thank you  for giving  we're obviously  all huge  fans  one of those  things that  many people  want to talk  about  right  exactly  but I've got  to tell you  one thing  all the  all the teens  I've met  and some  survive  and a lot

[01:09:30]  pen jillette outside the studio and  roland just handed us uh ice cream  yeah i normally wouldn't eat ice cream  this early in the morning but i'm gonna  have a couple of bites  how you doing my friend  absolutely  what's up pen  oh i'm gonna try out some of this  ice cream here  you better  the ice cream looks all right brother  it's really good  it's really good  look at the packaging my god  oh my god  will this actually be in stores  what do you mean will it be it's in 
[01:10:00]  stores now  oh sorry  you know we've already bought several  cartons that's what we're supposed to  say  this is so creamy and delicious  it's good and it's mine  oh look at the chocolate in here oh my god  i'll have a couple of bites i've been  on a good diet but uh i have to try it  it would be it would be on it would be  employed  oh my god  ice cream is so good  i'm gonna have such gasses on the  plane today too because lactose does  that to me  that's my main motivation  oh no that's right 
[01:10:30]  yeah  yeah  jimmy goes yeah  what's the story um behind the uh ice  cream  well you know i'm on this television  program called celebrity  yes we do know that  and the final task  i'm a finalist  you know  and last time i was here i was  already a finalist  but i kept it from you  i know you did  i did  i kept it from you  we tried to get it out of you too  i know i know  but i was a father  but you knew in your heart  yeah we did  you're like nixon  you know in your heart  he's right  how good is the ice cream  oh my god  so uh we had a design 
[01:11:00]  for walgreens  or as it is in new york  dwayne reed  we had a design  and ice cream  and uh and uh  trace went with uh  carpet fibers and shit  as his  as his flavor  and i went with this  uh rich vanilla ice cream  with sea salt chocolate  and uh fudge caramel candy  pieces  it's all about the sea salt  this is amazing  yes it is  and that's my idea  sea salt has taken over the world  yeah  that's pretty good  you so  you you just won  i just nailed it  i think i did yeah  right when you said that 
[01:11:30]  i got a taste of the chocolate  with the sea salt  who would think that would be good  with ice cream  it is  pen gillette  exactly  celebrity apprentice  that's the answer  you're also a magician  with ice cream  my friend  and it's uh  it's a hundred thousand bucks  to whoever sells the most ice cream  to our charity  i thought per carton  yeah  and it would be a bargain at that  wouldn't it  wait i gotta ask one question  before i endorse your ice cream  yeah  does the other guy have peanut butter  in his ice cream  no  oh okay  i'm all in  i'm all in  he has macadamia maple  ew 
[01:12:00]  no that's terrible  that's a good reaction  that is it  that is it  this is all american  when i said carpet fibers and shit  you went yeah  when i say macadamia maple  ew  my charity is a charity opportunity village in vegas  it's kind of a david and goliath thing  because he's got  i was hoping he would go for american nazi party  but instead he went for red cross  which is a fine charity  but you know a hundred thousand bucks  to a local charity in vegas 
[01:12:30]  that helps people with intellectual disabilities get jobs  is huge  you know  a hundred thousand bucks for the red cross  it's like  ah fuck you  a hundred thousand bucks  we got that up our ass  so you know  i'm hoping  and i've been eating this ice cream  you know  because i go on shows  yeah  you know  and i eat the ice cream for show  but i still end up eating it  i love it  it's so good  and i mean this very sincerely  that might be the best ice cream i've ever eaten  i'm not being polite because you're here  well thank you  that is fucking amazing  did you actually come up with this  yourself  yes  that's the nutty thing about celebrity apprentice 
[01:13:00]  because i don't know what's real with that shit  well no  some of the  most of celebrity apprentice is just real  they don't read stuff behind the camera  they don't do retakes  all that stuff i've done in every other show  they don't do  is there a way  wait wait  i had a second  bet on the winner  because you got this  you got this  okay well good  you know  i hope so  hold on i had a second question  so you came up with this right  yeah  it's an amazing flavor  jimmy's saying it's the best ice cream you ever ate  i really mean it  i can't stop  does freaking donald trump own this ice cream now  or do you got a piece of the action 
[01:13:30]  i have a piece of the action after a year  oh  no one's gonna care in a year  wait don't say that  please don't say that  there's gonna be another ice cream in a year  you just throw me away  discard me like your cum filled socks in the bottom of the bed  don't you  i'm looking out for you  oh that donald trump is tough  is what i'm getting at  you come up with this amazing flavor  and you don't get the action until a year from now  this has longevity  yeah people will come back to this  plus penn's famous enough to go out and promote it yourself after 
[01:14:00]  it's like  you are famous penn  well thank you  you're very famous  you look thinner too  oh my god  i'm thinner and famous  they go together  look at angelina jolie  um  and uh  yeah  so i'm a finalist  i'm a uh  i'm a uh  finalist on the show  congrats  you got this  we don't know  it's  i think it should be very very close  but the funny thing is  um  every other year  most of the years  they've had real animosity  with the two finalists  right  and trace and i get along great 
[01:14:30]  you get along yeah  yeah  get along wonderfully  because you know  why would there be animosity  on a television show  but there sometimes is  yeah well people get very competitive  sometimes they make  we're doing the best we can  i think sometimes they make drama  you know  you guys get along though  very well  you performers  yeah  this ice cream is ridiculous  i gave mine to sam  i ate like fucking five bites  and it's crazy  you're not gonna get mad  if i throw this away  because i  i can't eat this whole fucking thing  give it to like rolling  it's too good  give it rolling to eat it 
[01:15:00]  it's so god damn good  wow  and it's only until saturday  that it counts  i've gotten to the salt part  you know there's a bunch of  uh  there's  you know every walgreens  every duane reed has it  uh  i suggest very strongly  you not even try his flavor  yeah  if you try his flavor  it doesn't help me at all  let me tell you something  don't try his flavor  because the guy  hasn't come on our show  he doesn't come on your show  no it's all about pen gillette  good  don't even try the other flavor  just buy pen's ice cream  macadamia maple  it sounds terrible 
[01:15:30]  yeah well i don't care for it  but some people  it's only good on pancakes  that's a niche  that's a niche flavor  this is a flavor for the people  this is universal  this is the people's flavor  you got your vanilla  and your chocolate  right in there  it's all american  you are  it's a  i got it  i'm like  god damn good  i'm tempted to just keep eating  i never really eat ice cream  i'm sea salting my ass off right now  look at this  all right  one more  how does he compete  that other one  sounds awful 
[01:16:00]  yeah well you know  it would be nice to win  if i do not win  if i do not bring home  the bacon for o and a  will you still love me  yes  i'll like you more if you lose  because i'll relate to you  oh by the way  on pen sunday school  for those who listen  this sunday is jim's show  oh good good  because i'll be here doing  celebrity apprentice  we're rolling that in now  so uh you'll be on  that was a really good show  you know i understand  why you have him on here 
[01:16:30]  he's good all the time  thank you  you finally have an understanding  why we have this guy on here  sam you're enjoying your ice cream  it's delicious  when is the uh finale  for celebrity apprentice  this weekend  sunday yeah  okay so we're right  right there now  and that's live  yeah  oh it is okay  well they do uh  they roll in about  it's a two hour show  they roll in about an hour  and then we come out  and they try to get us to  i guess uh you know  arm wrestlers  how hard is it not to tell  people you're a finalist  you know um  you had to keep that quiet 
[01:17:00]  for how long now  about four or five months  what if my  my skill set  keeping secrets is there  that is true  oh fuck me  you know i could also  i could deliberately  mislead you if i want  i didn't even have to do that  which is like you know  and the mbc says to me  you know this is very  important that you keep  i go yeah we catch  bullets in our teeth  i think i can handle this  yeah i talk an awful lot  but you'd be surprised  at how much i'm shutting up 
[01:17:30]  how little you say  yes  i don't i don't give you  the hints when i'm not  supposed to  no idea  and i do want to say  because this is something  i is that my charity  opportunity village  which will be buying  the ice cream for  at walgreens  dwayne reed  it was elvis's favorite  charity  oh really  yeah you know the scarves  that elvis used to  take off his neck  and wipe his ground  and kiss  every single one of those  was made at  opportunity village  opportunity village  you know people  with intellectual disabilities  gives them jobs 
[01:18:00]  helps them get jobs  in the community  but they also had a  workshop that just  made elvis scarves  so as i said  to mr trump  and i will say again  on the finale  i said you know  if you're not for me  you're against my charity  and if you're against  my charity  you're against elvis  and if you're against  elvis sir  fuck you  what else  he'd be saying  yeah he used to  every one of the scarves  that he would take  and i have one of the  scarves  one of the real elvis ones  oh you do  if the guy would  who is that  would put it on his back 
[01:18:30]  Elvis would throw one out  and then someone  would drape one on his back  yeah yeah  put a new one on  i forgot the guy's name  the women would go wild  with the beatles  you know  everybody in the band  george martin  everything  with elvis  there's just elvis  maybe scotty moore  maybe you know  the guitar player  but if you say to  somebody you know  who's elvis's  favorite drummer  no idea  so the guy  that put the scarves  on  not a chance  he's way out  of the mix  yeah yeah  i met his best friend  at dice's wedding  jerry  okay i'm getting  close to you there  yeah jerry 
[01:19:00]  you got that  elvis connection  the brother  of the guy  who put the scarves  on elvis  i don't know  what he did  jerry something  i don't know  what it is  but he's saying  he was best friends  with elvis  yeah he's in all  the fucking elvis  videos  i know  i keep dipping  into the damn  ice cream  i'm actually  staring at pen's  ice cream  like it's tits  because i don't  want to throw it  away in front of him  that's not the reason  you're actually  enjoying it  i already said  i'm enjoying it  but i don't  i'm enjoying it  so much  i don't want to  eat the whole  damn thing  i just gave mine  to fucking sam 
[01:19:30]  yeah  i'd save it  for later  but it's gonna  melt all over  the place  i would never  have thought  that's sea salt  you taste it  in the chocolate  sea salt  oh it's a little  shit  a little salt  in there  it's good ice cream  we get the dark  chocolate with the  sea salt at home  we got to  we got to go into  a you know a lab  like a food lab  and i'm thinking  they're putting us  in the coats and shit  i'm thinking  yeah this is wanky  this is just  your fucking tv  and then you go in  there and there's  actually a person  whose life  is making ice cream 
[01:20:00]  you know  and they get all  this stuff  and she goes  well what do you like  and i started telling her  you know i  i was doing like  a turtle type thing  some sea salt  some chocolate  and she said  can't use the word  turtle  it's trademark  because i thought  i would get  turtle ice cream  it's called swertle  i would get  turtle ice cream  and then i would get  uh howard kalen  and mark volman  who are friends of mine  the turtles  to play at the final party  you know  turtle ice cream  they said oh no no  turtle with ice cream  other people own that  that's copyright problems 
[01:20:30]  so we went with  uh  went with swertle  i like swertle  is kind of catchy  it's very catchy  it's got the swirl  of chocolate in there  did you ever think  did you ever think  you would see  someone you knew  on the carton  of a dairy product gym  that wasn't locked  in your closet  no not at all  exactly  i've got quite a few  of the milk carton  autographs  magic swertle  there it is  yeah  and a picture of me  yes  you know  a picture of me  on an ice cream  stare at that 
[01:21:00]  while you spoon out  the ice cream  yeah exactly  treat for the  talent in the eyes  let your mind  go wild  as you eat  the ice cream  so what happens  you go through  the process  of trying it  and you take a bite  like and then  they cloy back  in an hour  and they go  alright we've done  this  no no  they have this  this monster  instant freeze  machine  you know  and you kind of  go  the vanilla  is a little  cloying  and they go  okay  let's pull it  let's pull it back  a little bit  and they go  and you go  and Dennis Rodman 
[01:21:30]  has this incredibly  sophisticated ice cream  palette  so Dennis Rodman  is sitting there  going  a little bit  more so  really  and she goes  okay  and you go  wow  because I was  satisfied with  the ice cream  like three steps  before Dennis was  you know  and so Dennis  is just tasting  tasting tasting  and Dennis goes  it's perfect  like okay Dennis  go get dressed  for the party  you just brought  him along 
[01:22:00]  or he was  on your team  he was on my team  so we had  I had Dennis  Latoya  and Lisa Rinna  were my team  and we put it  together  so  how's Latoya  is she nuts  you know  is she nuts  no she isn't  I know  that's why I'm asking  it's surprising  because we all think  people that have met her  say that she's not nuts  but she certainly  portrays that she's nuts  it's remarkable because  we had  I didn't get to work  with Dennis  or with Latoya  for the whole season  and then they threw  them on my team  at the end 
[01:22:30]  as kind of a change up  you know  to see how we do  and Latoya  I was kind of hesitant  because I had never  worked with her  so I thought  that she was nuts  and I thought  she was really  straightforward  and  kind of smart  I don't mean  you know  smart like  Richard Feynman  smart  I don't think  Stockholm  is on the phone  going  which Nobel  do we give her  it's kind of tough  it's either chemistry  or medicine  she's got both  in the bag  we can't give her both  which do we do  I don't think  Stockholm is having 
[01:23:00]  any trouble with that  but for show business  which you know  is a whole  that's the special  Olympics of intellect  who's she above  in smarts  well you know  who's just below her  in smarts  just below her  in smarts  I don't know  probably Stephen Baldwin  okay  alright  very good answer  that is a very good  answer  and  you know  I like them both  and Latoya's great  and then Latoya  you know  Teller comes in  for the final task  and the cameras  are all rolling  and Latoya's having 
[01:23:30]  this conversation  with Teller  and Teller's looking  at her and smiling  and she takes  about five minutes  to realize  that Teller doesn't talk  and then  we realize  that Latoya Jackson  has never heard  of Ben Teller  she's one of them  that sucks  absolutely great  and so she learns  that Teller doesn't talk  unlike Leon Russell  you know  I was on Fallon  with Leon Russell  who's a big hero of mine  you know  played with a wrecking crew  on every single  from like 61 to 64 
[01:24:00]  the piano was Leon Russell  every single  that comes out  you know  from Gary Lewis  you know  and the playboys  to all that stuff  is all  all Leon Russell  and of course  then the Joe Cocker  and then the stuff  on his own  and he's there  in a wheelchair  with a long beard  and the long hair  and he  I walk up  and I go  Mr. Russell  so nice to meet you  he goes  I don't suppose  your partner's  going to talk to me  oh there you go  wow  Leon Russell  he knows  because that  I'm okay with that 
[01:24:30]  with people  like Leon Russell  should never have heard  of Penn and Teller  he's got better things to do  but Latoya Jackson  she's got five minutes  find out who Penn and Teller  but I had them on my team  and it was  you know the surprising thing  about Celebrity Apprentice  is first of all  everybody else  bitches about the hours  because you work from like  5 a.m. to 10 p.m.  and that's like  my usual work day  so I'm okay  yeah yeah  but everybody else  is like whoa  that's long and tedious  and it's also  it's also pretty fun 
[01:25:00]  because you get to go  into a lab  and see how they make ice cream  which I didn't know  I know  like a lab  you just think  oh you know  they bring in some milk  and freeze it  I think there's like  a lab cult  and people in a sterile  environment  doing a testing  and also as you said  you think you leave  for like two hours  and come back  you don't think  they got magic  cold machine  to like a James Bond  villain  you know  Batman  Mr. Freeze  oh you want ice cream  instantly  bang 
[01:25:30]  you would think  the quality  wouldn't be as good  out of that  instant  freeze  well have you ever  had liquid nitrogen  ice cream  no  oh then you have  not lived sir  really  find yourself a supplier  because it's illegal  because you know  when I do  other people do  illegal stuff  it's like drugs  when I do  illegal stuff  it involves  sub-zero gases  but you can get  yourself through  a welding company  and a little bribe  on the side  you can get yourself  a container of  liquid nitrogen  you know  they used to do  in the school shows 
[01:26:00]  they freeze a banana  and smash it  and then you just  take a metal  mixing bowl  and you put in  some cream  some sugar  you know  some swirdle  put that into a bowl  just as soup  and then you take  a doer  as it's called  in the chemistry biz  see Stockholm's got  me on speed call  and you pour it  into there  while you mix it  now of course  if you spill too much  on you  you get frostbite  and you die  but you know  that's why  they try to keep  it illegal 
[01:26:30]  fucking pigs  just because  it can really  fuck you up  making ice cream  and then you  stir it in  and really  in like  six seconds  it makes a whole  batch  of ice cream  and of course  it's liquid nitrogen  so it goes  right into the air  it's gone  there are no  bubbles in it  no nothing  just this really  smooth  beautiful ice cream  made really  really wicked fast  why isn't that  supplied to the people  like in stores 
[01:27:00]  well because  because making it  with liquid nitrogen  is really dangerous  see I'm suggesting  when you do stuff  that's dangerous  it's like heroin  which there's a  really strong upside  to  right  you know  that is true  the upside  the downside  is you lose your hand  the upside  is the ice cream  is terrific  exactly  and risk reward  it's not up there  with heroin  it's just not  in the same  risk reward  with heroin  is you've got  some sores  all over your body  and you feel like 
[01:27:30]  you're coming  24 hours a day  that's a good  risk reward  right  few sores  on your body  I feel great  but lose a hand  have a good  thing of ice cream  you've got to be  in that special  pendulant category  this is pretty good  though  no nitrogen used  but  it's ridiculously good  I keep digging in  and you guys  will be  I'm sure  your listeners  will run out  and buy it  and buy cases  and also  hide traces  over behind  the rocky road  you don't need that 
[01:28:00]  you don't need that  at all  terrible flavor  and then there's  this wonderful  where do they go again  Walgreens  Walgreens  which is Dwayne Reed  you're national  you're bad  you're nationwide  it's Walgreens  most of the places  I love that song  but I'm not even kidding  people are asking me  on Pal Talk  is it really  is it really good Anthony  or you just say  this is fucking great  because you would lie  on the air  but not on Pal Talk  not on Pal Talk  exactly  right  you're right  you're going to type  yeah I'm saying 
[01:28:30]  it's good  but boy  it really sucks  we sure pulled it over  on all those people  that's got to be  a new listener  because they all know  we'll tell  if it's good or not  after he leaves  exactly  yeah  you're going to let  Penn go  he's got a busy day  he's a very busy man  they're telling us  by the way  amazing  amazing ice cream  I really  I love this stuff  I'm going out  and buying some  good  and bringing it home  cases  and it only  counts until Saturday  there will still be 
[01:29:00]  ice cream after that  but I don't give a fuck  about it after that  I want for my charity  buy it right now  get the ice cream  and it's wicked good  it really is great  so it's one of the few times  you can actually eat ice cream  and be helping a charity  this money does not go  to a certain P. Gillette  this money  I mean for all  you want to be cynical  about Celebrity Apprentice  I am looking  if I do it right  $350,000  for a charity  that really does 
[01:29:30]  great work  of course if I lose  it's $350,000  for a charity  that also does  great work  but anyway  but you want to be the guy  I would like to be the guy  so we're not even going to mention  the other guy  but you're selling ice cream  with the other guy  right here in New York City  Penn Jillette's  Swizzle right  and um  Swirdle  Swirdle  Swizzle  Jesus  Swirdle  Swirdle  but the problem is  Swirdle's really small  on the packaging  alright  there he goes  go buy Penn's ice cream  it's  look  he's not in the room

[01:43:00]  firefighters  neighbors peeking through the trees  to see the blaze  the home of country music  superstar trace adkins  on fire  and i ran from the office  across the house  to the garage  the nanny  in the garage door  there's like a big window  it talks  you can see  into the garage  and all i could see  were just flames  and smoke  nanny lindsay weaver  runs with the girls  including two of atkins  daughters outside  to a meeting place  before calling atkins  wife ronda  and we were just  three minutes from here 
[01:43:30]  we looked up in the sky  we saw the black smoke  i started driving here  as fast as i could  i put on the flashers  and i just started passing  people  going as fast as i could  i even passed a cop  he was like following me  i'm like  what are you doing  my house is on fire  inside the house  now a total loss  are show clothes  civil war weapons  awards  and most important  to ronda atkins  family pictures  that's what i've lost  i didn't back up  all that stuff  i backed up a lot of it  but not all of it  and you hear people 
[01:44:00]  say this all the time  take the time  and copy your photos  but in the midst  of neighbors and friends  looking down the street  at a home submerged  in smoke  the atkins family  says they're amazed  everyone is okay  everybody got out  no one's hurt  my house is completely gone  um  but at the end of the day  it's okay  yeah  oh brother  if you have kids  i guess  like when you realize  your kids are alive  yeah  what else you know  can i can i  we have more info

[01:45:00]  what's with this guy  he has a finger  but  they didn't put it back  normally  because that would  fuck up his guitar playing  so they put it back  in a weird way  so he could play guitar  oh my god  what was the accident  hold on  hold on  hold on  i just found another fact  while i was looking  for the finger thing  all right  but can we do the finger thing  first or no  i'm gonna confirm  the finger thing  okay  but you want to add  the other fact  let me add  a little known fact  okay  about singer trace atkins 
[01:45:30]  yes  is that his debut album  dreaming out loud  was dedicated to his brother scott  scott was 21 years old  when he was killed  in a truck accident  oh jesus  his brother was killed  in a truck accident  this is just  just an all-american way  to die  now what about his finger  yeah  a little known fact  about country singer  trace atkins  is that his left  little finger  was cut off  in a work accident 
[01:46:00]  just a working joe  doctors reattached it  but his finger  is permanently bent  at an angle  because of this  trace can't play  many chords  on a guitar anymore  when he does play  he does the best  that he can  he's just doing  the best he can  with a missing finger  and shot through the heart  jesus  he says he would love  to learn the piano  but he realizes  his deformed finger  makes that an impossibility  there you go guys  I gotta go 
[01:46:30]  thank you  who has pen's number  pen  I don't think he realizes  he's in a lot of trouble  he should just skate today  he shouldn't try at all  no forget the ice cream  it's not worth it  fuck that he has  the greatest ice cream  doesn't matter  so you gotta go out  and buy a pen ice cream  wait can you make a  you know we're  we're all about  having a nice list  on the show  sam  yeah  I'm losing track  yeah what  do you think we like  lists on this show  yes I love  a good list  maybe we  can we do a side by side

[02:06:30]  before we get to that anthony on friday was late he was uh he slept in it happens to the best of us  however uh opi was in there he's going it alone he started talking about his relationship that had  kind of fallen off with greg brady barry williams and the friendship they once had that they don't  have anymore he decided just because it's early in the morning doesn't mean i can't blindly call  barry williams do you think he changed his number in the years that have gone by since opi last talked 
[02:07:00]  to him well i guess you'll just have to find out with the rest of us right now won't you  number two number two a paul anka friendship is way better than a greg brady friendship  yeah yeah i called him last night and see if i could go see colin with you maybe i could check  out uh bel-air again i'll bet you can that's where greg brady used to live you can get with his very  why what happened why doesn't he live in bel-air anymore well you know he got a divorce 
[02:07:30]  and i learned over the years that he might have been living in bel-air because of his wife  oh no his wife had money maybe she became the breadwinner after uh the brady the brady bunch  reunions dried up right he he lived in bel-air at the top of one of those mountains overlooking  everything not anymore that was a past everything but he invited me over to his house gave me his  address and everything that's sick i remember being in la driving up uh 
[02:08:00]  this this like mini mountain in bel-air looking at the numbers of the houses you know trying to  find where greg brady lives and i called uh i called a really good friend of mine freaking out like a  little fucking school girl i'm like you're not gonna believe this what i'm i'm driving to greg brady's  i had to tell people i gotta tell someone now and then i and then i called uh look brady bunch is on  tv as i speak or some weird fucking uh commercial for the brady bunch or some fucking they're using 
[02:08:30]  a uh a mr brady clip for some publisher's clearing yeah is that what that is all right anyway so then  i called family member i i started calling everyone i know as i was getting closer to greg brady's house  i needed everyone to know where i was headed where are you at right now yeah i'm just uh right i'm just  on my way to greg brady's house and then i parallel parked in front of a ridiculous looking  ridiculously uh a ridiculous looking house and then i walked up to the the the gates 
[02:09:00]  and i had to push the button and uh and then uh he he's on the other end i'm like hey hey  barry it's opie oh you made it great let me budge in and then i'm just gulping as i'm walking up  the sidewalk going i'm walking into greg brady's house it was the most surreal thing ever it was so  fucked up did he have brady bunch memorabilia on display oh yeah a lot of it yeah but he had the  brady bunch episodes i remember uh he had all his brady bunch episodes on vhs tapes i i always thought 
[02:09:30]  that was strange is he watching them hey and this was about this was about 10 years ago but i mean  people were definitely you know in the dvd world oh yeah yeah yeah but i also thought if you're greg  brady and you were on the brady bunch you know they had other ways to you know uh save this shit  sure but he was still in the vhs world they were all taped off tv right so and then i went back to  greg brady's house another time and that's when i had the famous uh leftovers because i kind of came 
[02:10:00]  unannounced hey greg my name's barry yeah greg all right great i went up there with my friend jay  who moved out to la and i i was out in la i'm like hey why don't we go uh why don't we go say  hi to greg brady yeah why don't we go say hi i know where he lives don't even worry about it because  at this point i'm like now i gotta take someone to greg brady's house of course now that i've been  there now i gotta take someone else and did he give you that open invite like hey come back anytime 
[02:10:30]  so i called him and he's a really nice guy well when he came to new york i i had dinner with him  as well with a few people he's a really nice guy i'm kind of bummed we've lost touch over the last  few years but anyway um so then i i uh i call him up he goes yes come on over we're about to you know  have a little dinner or something i'm like all right great so i i went with my friend jay and he  invited us in again and we had cocktails out overlooking everything with an infinity pool ridiculous spot 
[02:11:00]  and uh and then i remember being in his house as him and his wife at the time are looking in the  trying to figure out what they're gonna what they're gonna uh we gotta serve us we gotta feed  these guys well i don't you didn't tell me they were coming i didn't know they were coming  and uh greg brady had a beautiful like pasta dish yeah that was fresh freshly made and his wife same  thing and then i had the leftovers they didn't have enough pasta for you i'd have to go back into 
[02:11:30]  the archives because i i used to tell people what i had that day do you remember iraq no i don't i  think i remember there was some kind of peas in it you'd be surprised opie it's not delivery it's  di giorno right but i do remember them looking into the fridge and and you know i remember it  thinking oh fuck you gotta we gotta they don't have enough food we gotta try to figure out what's  cool enough to to to serve me do you think this caused their divorce i don't know i have no idea

[02:16:30]  he was on the air  he knew he was on the air  oh yeah  that would be a very different conversation if uh  he wasn't on the air  he wouldn't have answered if he was pissed  how funny was it  the realization that that was not his voicemail  say what  i totally thought it was  i thought it was the coolest voicemail ever  just say what  i thought he finally figured out the voicemail thing  and then he's just on the phone not saying anything  while we're all saying where's the beep  right  oh anthony just wrote hilarious  holy fuck  this is great

[02:23:00]  has boogers in it  i'm just telling you  that could be  detrimental  to ice cream sales  at least i tried  to disguise mine  with macadamia nuts  so if something  falls in there  during production  people think  it's a macadamia  right  that's a good strategy  but his just has  boogers  but we gotta  explain a trace  we're really good  friends with pen  jolette  he does the show  a lot  but then we  kind of started  looking into your  history  and we're all in  we're hoping you  win this thing  pen is sunk  because your  backstory is way  better than  pen jolette's  absolutely  as far as 
[02:23:30]  country artists  go  you fit that  bill that  everyone has  stereotyped over  the years of  taking tragedy  and turning it  around  pulling yourself  up by the  proverbial  bootstraps  as they say  well I  suppose so  that's why  I think I've  written one  positive love  song in my  life  and I was  commissioned to  write that one  and I think  that's about it  you came up as a  working guy  you know  you worked in  oil field  for 10 years 
[02:24:00]  oil field  I worked offshore  on drilling rig  for 6 years  roughneck  worked derrick  wow  that's a real  job  that's how I  cut my finger  off  yeah yeah  apparently we  read you  cut your finger  off  yeah I cut  that one  off  it's permanently  at 90 degree  angle  they put it  back on  but it's  bent like  that  the doctor  asked me  he said  it's not  going to  work anymore  I think I  can save  it but  how do you  want it  straight  and I said  no  I said  put it  in a  sus position  so now  you can  play  I said  at least 
[02:24:30]  I can  suspend  a D  or a G  you know  I said  put it  in a sus  position  he went  excuse me  I showed  him with  my other  hand  I said  dude  like that  that's  having  some  forethought  well dude  no not really  because I mean  the second  that I cut  it  that was  the first  thing I  thought  well there  goes my  guitar  playing  you know  it was  pretty much  over at  that point  wow  there's no  way he's  seeing  Liberace  no  no  you worked  in those  oil rigs  that go  off the  coast  and stuff  yeah  wow  that's where 
[02:25:00]  the offshore  ones are  Jesus Christ  yeah  oh no  I hung out  to dry  there  I'm sorry  Colin  I told  Colin  I'd be  nice to  him  and by  the way  as Bobby  Kelly pointed  out to me  it was always  funny to me  when it was  boss  or Bobby  Kelly  then it was  me  then I was  like oh  this is not  funny at all  that's true  man that  thing you  and Seinfeld  did a while  back was  brilliant  oh thanks  damn  absolutely  brilliant  the one man  show  that was  brilliant  he's got  a new  one  that we  saw last  night  that was  great  great 
[02:25:30]  I'll bust  it out  I want  it  that's great  I'm all  over it  I'm in  he does  do a great  there  what are  your  I could  probably  guess  but your  political  affiliations  as far as  things that are  going on  the news  these days  what I say  is the  dismantling  of the  constitution  do you  get involved  in much  of that  well I  don't get  involved  in it  you know  I don't  and people  know that  too  they come  to my  shows  and they're  not going  to get  beat over  the head  with any  that's  good  I don't  do that  and I  never have  and I  you know  what  and I  don't 
[02:26:00]  like  people  that  do  but at  least  you know  some of  the ones  that do  it  they're  right up  front  with it  and you  know  that  going  in  that  you're  going  to get  that  I don't  like to be  ambushed  by somebody  right  right  right  but anyway  I'm a pretty  conservative  guy  sure  you know  and what's  going on  right now  you know  I believe  that when  the government  starts using  agencies  to persecute  people that  they have  political  and philosophical  differences  with  that's tyranny  my friend  thank you  absolutely  god damn  I gotta  and with that  fucking voice  saying it  like that 
[02:26:30]  that means  business  it makes  you believe  I agree  god it's so  nice it's so  refreshing to  see somebody  in the  business that  we call  show  right  well I'm  sure you  heard something  similar to  that from  Penn yesterday  well yeah  yeah a little  bit  Penn again  also doesn't  really put  himself out  there  politically  much  yeah he is  a libertarian  and an atheist  he's sort of  a libertarian  yeah yeah  quasi-libertarian  quasi-libertarian  is just a  republican  who smokes  dope  that's true 
[02:27:00]  that's really  true  do you  do you go  shooting and  stuff  yeah I've heard  something  need shooting  no very good  yeah  do you  I mean  I enjoy  a little  gun  gunfire  but I  go to the  range  not much  going on  well I do  appreciate my  second amendment  right  I've got a lot  of guns  I've got a lot  of guns  yeah yeah  I got a lot  it's very difficult  in New York  too  well I don't have a  predator drone  I want one of those  I want a drone 
[02:27:30]  man  well I got a pretty  big one with cameras  on it and stuff  I can send it up  autonomously to patrol  the neighborhood  awesome  awesome  that's great  I monitored some  people getting a pizza  delivery the other day  it was very exciting  very compelling video  I got from that one  but no I really do  and in New York  it's very difficult  as you probably know  to even say that you  you own guns  but no I love it  I picked up a  Barrett 50 caliber  they make those 
[02:28:00]  just right down the  road from where I  live in Murfreesboro  Tennessee  isn't that fantastic  you ever fire one  of those  I have  I don't have one  yet I'm about to  get one  I just got a  Desert Eagle 50  caliber  I got one of  those  what a treat  you take that  down to the  indoor range  and fire  they won't  at my indoor  range they won't  let me shoot it  they won't  over here in  Nessau they let  me but you  watch everybody  from all the  other slots  they peek their  head around  like what the hell  is he firing  it's a 50 caliber  pistol  it's the Arnold 
[02:28:30]  Schwartz  the guy that I  got it from  he said dude  don't ever  shoot anybody  in your house  with this  it's not the  most practical  wait till they  go outside  because it  will make  a mess  it's not the  most practical  gun to have  but it is a  lot of fun  I'm not worried  about the  killing  I'm worried  about the  clean up  you shoot a

[02:33:30]  said you  know what  five years  ago I  wouldn't even  have hung  out with  somebody like  you because  I'd gotten  really strung  out and it  was you know  I had to get  away from it  go back to the  oil field to  save my life  wow really  damn  that's partying  that's some  perspective  that's what  strung out  means  yeah  for you  from the  Liberace  movie  which one of  you Nancy's  doesn't like  maple in my  ice cream  anyway  oh boy I  don't know  who said  that  Sam  was that  you  oh Sam  saying he  doesn't like 
[02:34:00]  maple  yeah I  don't know  who said  that Trace  that would  be crazy  to say in  front of you  we just  assumed with  everything you  have going on  in your life  you were  probably head  of the maple  producers  coalition  write that  down  we're all  big fans of  maple  right in  how the hell  did you end  up with  maple  macadamia  mashup  let me tell

[02:35:00]  about him  I gotta say  though  the all-star  apprentice ice cream  here from Trace  the maple  macadamia mashup  proceeds going  to the Red  Cross  the American  Red Cross  see that's  pretty god damn  good right  there  you can't  totally say  you're sold  out  and then also  your Wounded  Warrior Project  work is  amazing  well that's  been a privilege  absolutely  right  you know  the association  with them  has just  been  just something  that has  just been  a humbling  experience  for me  I've been 
[02:35:30]  doing that  for a few  years now  just a great  organization  we hope you  win Celebrity  Apprentice  I do too  you just  told Penn  that  I said  it  after we  looked at  his backstory  that we  have to  go with  this guy  I did  say that  I changed  my opinion  even though  he's a  really good  friend of  ours  but how  do you  not root  for a guy  like this  Penn's a  really good  friend of  mine  too  yeah but  Penn has  a sex  dungeon  that's all  he's got  going for  how is the  Midwest going  to appreciate  a magician  with a sex  dungeon  we're going 
[02:36:00]  all American  with this one  I wonder what  bars they go to  when you work  on the oil  wigs  don't you guys  have like a  group of bars  you go and  you get into  a little flack  with the local  didn't you see  Armageddon  what's wrong  with you  of course they  do  you didn't see  Armageddon  a bunch of  roughnecks  out there in  space  did you watch  that  get out of  here  I could have  done that  I could have  done that  we got Guy  Fieri outside  too so I don't  know what to do  I'll sit on  the couch  I saw him  the other day 
[02:36:30]  what are you guys  doing  Colin you can't  do that  I'm sitting  right here  that's Fieri's  manager  that's a big  look how big  that is a big  son of a bitch  he might be  taller than you  Trace  he is tall  I met him  yesterday  he's taller  than me  here's Guy  Fieri  rock and roll  ACDC  for those about  to rock  right on his  fucking chest  baby  you know Trace  I just met him  the other day  God is he tall  yeah he's tall  your manager  he's not 
[02:37:00]  rocking a cowboy  hat and boots  he's in  Nikes  and a golf  shirt  I saw him  we met the  other day  what a great  guy  you hit the  tour man  you've been  all over  well that's  what they  make you do  when you have  a new album  come out  they make you  go dance  for granny  the girls  were going  nuts at that  show  the other day  like hey  I'm here  I'm cooking  I'm making  some food  you were cooking  at one of his  shows  I should have  been cooking  at one of his  shows  we were 
[02:37:30]  we were doing  one of the  morning shows  oh okay  we had a good  time  so we were  standing out  there grilling  and talking  about food  and the whole  thing  and he's  from Louisiana  we were talking  about knives  you've got to  respect the guy  that's got his  own line of  cutlery  yeah yeah  we were just  looking at that  knuckle sandwich  knives  that's all right  great names  big sharp blade  great name for  his knives  yes indeed  God do you  remember we met  Austin Texas  really  Colin Quinn  Colin makes  a face like  nah  you recognize 
[02:38:00]  me  Austin Texas  he's so proud  of himself  that he remembered  something  did you see that  that look on his  face  that was awesome  he had a senior  moment  he's like  I remembered  something  come on  I know  senior moment  Magnolia  bakery treats  guy  he also switched  spots for Tom  Papa  yeah Tom  I think Tom  felt a little  like you know  Tom should be  on the couch  quite frankly  I was like  Colin Quinn  is to be up  but Guy and I  go way back  also 
[02:38:30]  I want an  expert opinion  Tom  try some of that  ice cream  man  I don't care  if y'all tried  I want him  to try  he's the expert  what is this  called  moonshine mashup  see I tell you  if there would have  been a little  moonshine in this  I think these are  great  yo the mad  cubans in here  too  no you're not  the mad cuban  we love him  you were the  one who introduced  us to him  and now he does  our show  it has a  butterscotch  taste to it  it's very good  and it's good  and it's pretty  good 
[02:39:00]  I hope you  should try  something  shut the front  door  I just thought  you know  Penn he did  he went way  out there  and mixed  vanilla and  chocolate  I did a  maple macadamia  which my  young lady  they called  her an  ice cream  wizard  she said  that as far  as she knew  that hadn't  been done  I'll tell you  I had Penn's  yesterday  and he's got 
[02:39:30]  salt in his  he's got a  sea salt  with salt  and the  counterbalance  to the sugar  I mean it  really plays  nicely  and they had  big chunks  of chocolate  and kind of  a bittersweet  chocolate  but I'm not  a huge  chocolate guy  this right  here reminds  me of  like pralines  and cream  that macadamia  that survives  in there  a lot of  time the nuts  kind of get  crushed  and the little  soft  and they  don't have  any texture  this has  great texture  it's not  overly sweet  you think  maple  and I'm  like  oh boy  someone's  going to  go crazy  with the  Mrs. Butterworth  but this  has got a  good balance  man 
[02:40:00]  she kept  coming to me  and I would  say  come on  give me  some more  maple  and she kept  cranking up  the maple  intensity  I thought  I may have  gone a little  too far  with it  you think  it's alright  it's almost  too much  can you ship  this to people's  houses  or can you  only buy  Dwayne  and Walgreens  is it only  in New York  they carry it  no  it's  everywhere  I'm  nationwide  dude  what's wrong  nationwide  nationwide  god damn 
[02:40:30]  is that a  great song  tell us about  the new album  that's coming out  I got a new album  called Love Will  and it's just  nothing but love  songs  I've never done  that before  love will  dot dot dot  there you go  thank you guy  guy knows  the first time  I've ever done  that  we just started  playing your songs  yesterday  I didn't set out  to do it  really  I thought I had  the album done  in August  and then  this apprentice  thing came up  and I  whored out  and went  and did that  so I couldn't 
[02:41:00]  come out  in the fall  with the album  like I thought  I was going to  so we had to  delay the release  of it  and in the  meantime  I came up  with a few  more songs  and I recorded  them  and then  I realized  that I had  11 love songs  I had about  18-19 songs  cut  and I thought  wow 11 of  these are love  songs  so I'm just  going to put  out an album  of love songs  but it's not  like a bread  album  I mean don't  think that it's  that  because you've  got to keep  in mind  I'm the guy  that thinks  Badonkadonk is  a love song 
[02:41:30]  right yes  but I will say  this this album  is a deal  closer  you know  if you've got  and she's not  cooperating  and spending  an evening  with her  put this album  on  or let her go  must have  been  somebody's  baby  Jennifer Jason  Lee's getting  plowed again  every time  that god damn  song  came out  did anything 
[02:42:00]  change in your  life where you're  like I love  songs let me  jot a few of  these down  no you know  I don't  not not  consciously  I don't  but maybe  there's something  going on  you know I  think I don't  want to get  all into that  stuff man  but I suppose  there's a time  in a man's  life when he  starts staring  mortality in  the face  and you know  and you start  realizing  what was that  for you  like 10  based on your  bio  holy shit  no I always  thought I was  indestructible  now I kind of  know that I'm  not so 
[02:42:30]  yeah that kind  of second shot  in the heart  does that  to a man  yeah man  who said that  oh the couch  oh my Tom  I can't even  see him  at the kid  table  I couldn't  stand to see  Colin Quinn  after watching  the show  last night  you could stop  writing on the  couch  I couldn't  stand to see  I can't have  the legend  be on the  couch  you should have  seen when  Mark Cuban  and Bill Burr  was in the  air sitting  on that couch  it was  ridiculous  you were just  being pounded  that was terrible  now you're just  name dropping  Mark Cuban  wow  if I had a

[02:46:30]  boy we are  really  tell me about  the road trip  by the way  I want to  hear about  this  so we're  going to be  stopping  in a few  places  you know  anywhere  where's a  good place  along the way  give us an  example  you guys  just give  me the  itinerary  I will  set up  the feeding  zones  and we'll  weigh you  at the  beginning  of the  event  like  McCluskey  and then  we'll  weigh you  at Branson  we'll put  three of  those Branson  Missouri buffets  under your  belt  you know  I hear  Yakov's  place  Yakov's  dinner  adventure  what happens 
[02:47:00]  is he gives  you a real  metal tray  that has a  magnet on the  back and it  sticks on the  seat because  when you watch  Yakov's dinner  theater it's in  movie theater  seats you're  literally sitting  in movie theater  seats so they  have magnets  on the arm  you click  your metal  tray but  don't get  discouraged  genuine linen  napkins  real silverware  now you get a  spork  I know you get a  spork  this is what  they actually  pitch  they're advertising  this shit  they have real  linen napkins  real silverware  and a chicken 
[02:47:30]  cordon bleu  which I'm sure  is being pumped  out of there  like the chocolate  on that Lucy  conveyor belt  we're going  old school  with that  Jerry's Jubilee  Jerry's Jubilee  I want to  bake the  Alaska  we're very  excited about  that  so how long  will the trip  take  a week  about a week  we're just  going to do  Memphis  Nashville  we got some  good  I got some  good  I got great  Austin great  food  Memphis great  food  Nashville great  food  I got a  barbecue joint 
[02:48:00]  right outside  of Nashville  can we just  walk in and  go  Caffieri  sent us  rock and roll  yeah  we're going  to try to  set it up  to that degree  this will be  good stuff  how many  people in your  crew  what's your  posse going  to look like  not including  the broads  that we're  going to get  on the bus  the broads  oh boy  because you know  they're asleep  by 930 at night  the posse  is going to  look like  you ever seen  that  see this type  of the gas  station  and one flew  over the  coopers  now  that's 
[02:48:30]  about right  they're going  to look like  convoy  you know  with all  these dilapidated  rigs  behind you  it's going  to be pretty  shitty  people flashing  you when  they drive  by the bus  maybe a couple  of CB's  so we can  talk to each  other  that'd be  nice  CB's would  be a nice  touch  buddy  I was the  wrangler  are you going  to bring the  hardware  that's right  what  you're going  to bring  the hardware  I don't think  I can bring  my piece  why not  you cross state  lines  everything's  fucked up  it's not  smoky in the  bandit  you can't  do that  I had one  on the bus  one time  I forgot  about it  it was in my  nightstand  by my bed  and then we 
[02:49:00]  how do they  come on and  handcuff you  is what I  want to know  no shit  get on there  and get him  I copped to  it immediately  because it was  like border  crossing trainee  day and so  they were just  like going  through everything  so I immediately  said okay  wait I forgot  about something  and then I  told them  where it was  shouldn't they  take things  like that  into consideration  and know  that it's 
[02:49:30]  like look  it's Trace  He's not  going to  be blasting  off in  Canada  with this  gun  it was  an honest  mistake  you know  as opposed  to somebody  you know  is trying  to commit  some kind  of real  crime  it was  weird  and then  when they  gave me  my pistol  it was a little  .380 automatic  it wasn't a big  deal but they  handed it back  to me  and they  completely  disassembled it  so it was  just all  in pieces  and I had  to walk  back across  the border  and mail it  home  they wouldn't  let me  drive back  across  wow  so now 
[02:50:00]  do you have  a weapons  charge on you  in Canada  or something  no  but that's  why they  really got  mad  because I  had a  weapons  charge here  and  oh  oh boy  I like the  fact that  every question  trace answers  is like  another story  really  this leads to  another  whole story  I love it  we were  shipping the  Camaro  we used  for Triple D  across the  border  and I  just was at  Kid Rock's  place  doing a  shoot  for Triple  and we  loaded it  up  we loaded  it up  you don't 
[02:50:30]  like the  beer  or you  don't  like  Rock  they found  guns  and dope  and women  in the  trunk  of the  car  so we  loaded up  he makes  this great  beer  we had  on the  show  I wanted  to take  some back  to California  so I threw  it in the  trunk of  my Camaro  I just  happened to  forget the  Camaro was  on it's  way to  Canada  so I  get a  call from  this driver  stressing out  there is  beer in  the back  of your  car  where the  hell did  that come  from  but they  actually let  it go  they let  the car  come into  Canada  cruise around 
[02:51:00]  with the  10 cases  and cruise  back out  no weapons  charge  you gotta  watch that  I hate  the fact  that you  go from  one state  to another  and your  gun's good  here  it's not  good  here  you're  responsible  and we  trust you  and you  went through  all the  hoops  here  like in  New York  you gotta  go through  so much  I should  be able  to cover  every  goddamn  state  in the  union  but you  know  I can't  drive across  Jersey  unless it's  in a locked  box  separate from  the ammo  you're not  stopping  until you  get to  Pennsylvania  you know  shit like  that  which is 
[02:51:30]  really stupid  because then  if someone  steals the  car  instead of  the gun  being on  you  where you  have  possession  of it  and know  where it  is and  make no  sense  they punish  the law  abiding  citizen  do nothing  to make  anyone  safer  where is  this coming  from  I've never  heard you  talk like  this  do you  know  a New Yorker  just got  arrested  because of  the new  law that  only allows  seven rounds  in your  magazine  and he  had ten  because he  had a  ten round 
[02:52:00]  magazine  and he  got pulled  over  he had  a pistol  on his  seat  a state  he pulled  him over  and looked  saw the gun  the guy  says yes  I completely  legal  I got  this  the trooper  checked  the magazine  found that  there were  you know  three more  too many  bullets  or two  I think  it was a  nine round  magazine  he had  so it was  only two  extra  bullets  and arrested  him  and now  the guy  has got  a weapons  charge  on him  because of  that  how did  that  make  anyone  any  safer  how did  that law  just make  New York  a safer  place to live  because a  guy that  legally owns 
[02:52:30]  a gun  has all  the permit  had two  bullets  too many  in his  magazine  the laws  are ridiculous  talk  your boy  Cuomo  yeah  well  he's  the gun  charge  I had  was a  similar  kind of  thing  I wasn't  doing  anything  illegal  I had  a pistol  and it  was in  the pocket  of the  door of  my truck  and at  the time  I didn't  have a  carry permit  but anyway  so the  pistol was  there in  the door  and it  was loaded  of course  and I got  pulled over  for something 
[02:53:00]  else  and the  guy looks  and he  goes  is that  gun loaded  and I  said  is your  gun  loaded  yes  loaded  you know  two useless  things  in this  world  a dull  knife  and an  empty  gun  you know  so  he said  assume  the position  and took  me directly  to jail  but that's  my gun  charge  I mean  I didn't  you know  I didn't  like  what state  was that  that was  Tennessee  now I have  a carry  permit  in Tennessee  so they're  all cool

[03:02:30]  he's almost  he almost is like Ted Bundy  in that he's the perfect  person you know  on the outside  and you're like wow  what the hell is this  you know what's going on  but this is what he does too  is he lets you in  that there is stuff wrong with him  even though  that he  lets you in a little bit  like yeah I have that problem too  or I'm doing that too  and you're like  ah he's just like me  but you're not  no you're Dan Soto  yeah  first of all he's gonna end up  like that guy that stabbed the therapist to death  he stabbed the wrong one you know 
[03:03:00]  who  that guy  you know up west side  like last year  they just had his trial recently  he went in  to kill his therapist  really  and the other  the other poor therapist in the office  tried to stop him  goes hey man  or the therapist wasn't there  but went like hey  you know you gotta calm down  and he killed that therapist instead  really  bloody  with a knife  wow  nice up west side building  but um  I guess apparently  now the doorman  or the doorman was like  hey guys good luck  I see a psycho with a knife  I'm diving under  hey yeah  pay me that much  apparently he didn't work on scale either 
[03:03:30]  yeah  you know what I mean  those guys  those guys are just fucking upstairs from a subway  you have to take a window  you have to get  to my therapist  you have to go in the window  you do  no I'm kidding  well you have those side doors sometimes  you know  yeah  he  it's definitely a shitty  there's a massage thing above him  what  you heard me  are you serious  yeah  it's legit though  I've been four times  I'm one  just to make sure  I'm one step away  from getting a free massage  you're like  maybe he sets it up there  as a test  he's like 
[03:04:00]  hey  I want to find out  how sick my clients are  then he goes and asks them  have you seen this face  I'm completely honest with him  I tell  there's been times  where I'm like  I'm not telling him this  I'm not  there's no need  he needs to know this  yeah  I'm just gonna  I got it  that's fucked up thinking  yeah  where you're like  I got this  I know  I know I fucked up  yeah  I know what I did  I fucked up  right  I got this  I don't need to tell him  I know what he's gonna say  but it's the  when you get in there  all of a sudden  it's like  no you have to tell  you have to be 
[03:04:30]  100% honest  with this human being  because if not  it's that little  dark secret you have  and the next one  and the next one  and the next one  and all of a sudden  I'm gonna be doing  terrible shit  yeah  I don't know if that makes sense  yeah  of course  it makes total sense  yeah  but yeah  but Dan Soto  he had a blast  driving up and back  yeah  I mean he really is  he's a  he's a  you know  he's a real gentleman  let's face it  everybody  if people don't like Dan Soto  there's probably  something weird  who else is a side to Dan  that they only get to see 
[03:05:00]  like Ted Bundy  yeah he is man  he's a  he's got that  but he laughs  he laughs at your jokes  and makes you feel like  you're the funniest guy  on the planet  right  his laugh  is what I think  gets him ahead  in the business  were you ever that guy  were you ever the  the guy that everybody loved  on the other side  of the business  on what side of the business  the industry  no  I was always  the comedians loved me  the comedians kept me  in this business  my whole career  really  yeah  but the industry  was never really  a fan of me  that's fucked  I'm sorry 
[03:05:30]  because  because  I was always the guy  that  for some reason  whenever I deal with industry  I rub them the wrong way  but I always got along  with all the people  all the comedy  they liked me  because all the comedians  liked me  but I just  there was just  not a  for some reason  we didn't click  me and the  industry people  you know  some of them  I got along  really good with  but as a general rule  it was always like  a weird vibe  I felt  you know  yeah  I don't  I don't know  what it is though  there's a certain person 
[03:06:00]  there's a certain type  of person  is it a  I don't know  they like sports  or they  they like certain teams  they know stats  I don't  yes  college  I don't  they like khakis  on weekends  or boats  or  fucking  you know  you know  beer  like  you know  home brewed  I don't know  what the fuck  it is  I know  what you're saying  there's something  that they  I don't have  right  I can't connect 
[03:06:30]  I connect to you  I connect to a guy  like you  right  I connect to a guy  like Norton  right  there's these certain  industry sides  that it's like  you know  I don't know  I just don't connect  no I know  what you're saying  that's why  like I  you know  I don't know  there's certain guys  I just  I see these guys  talking to these people  and I always  always want  hey  yeah  that's it  now that's all  you should say  honestly  that's all you should  say to them  really  yeah  you can't  yeah you can't 
[03:07:00]  be talking to these  people  you know what I mean  like you said  I'll tell you exactly  a perfect example  is when  I think it was  I think it was  Noam  who we all know  from the podcast  who is that  Noam  what does he do  oh okay  I know who you're  talking about  go ahead  I'm sorry  the owner of the  comedy  he's a perfect  example of a guy  not that he's an  industry guy  he's a great guy  but  and some industry  people  but anyway  he's the kind of  guy who goes to  Bob one day  we're sitting there  and he goes  Bobby  hey you know  I uh  I went to 
[03:07:30]  Tufts  in Medford  and Bob goes  yeah we used to  beat the shit  out of kids  and rob them  from Tufts  I was saying  if you had said  that to some  industry kid  who went to  Tufts  he'd be like  oh I think  I remember  actually  the one  uncomfortable  awkward time  in my freshman  year  I came home  after a couple  of my first  beers  I was 19  I wasn't even  sure I was  going to be in  showbiz  I was majoring  communications  though  and kind of  excited  I went to  see a  local improv  group  and I walked  home  and you  and two  of your  friends  pulled over  in the car  right  called me  hey creep 
[03:08:00]  and next  thing you know  I was on  the ground  being beaten  no cell phones  back then  but you know  my wallet was  all scattered  and shit  you know  you know  it's funny  though  I did say  that to him  and one of  his friends  got his car  pissed in  I think  I don't know  if I remember  but I think  we used to  do that too  we used to  put sand  in like  motorcycle gas  tanks  oh no  yeah  we used  yeah  we would  just  fucking  dickheads  nobody told  us  hey man  don't do 
[03:08:30]  that  hey man  that's somebody's  property  that they  worked hard  for  yeah  it's almost  like am I  getting  like the things  that happen  now  when you  get close  on a show  or something  really  your dream  is right there  and it gets  snatched away  I'm like  is that because  I lit the  tough soccer  poles on fire  five times  five times  yeah we lit  them on fire  so much  they had to  change them  from wood  to steel  and then we  stole a car  and we were  driving through  the field  we were going  to actually  instead of 
[03:09:00]  light them  on fire  we were going  to run  them over  and at  the last  second  Michael  Dotz  grabbed the  wheel  and went  no  and we  bumped into  a steel  we would have  been fucking  dead  can you imagine  that  what  they must  have  you guys  did it  so many  times  they actually  changed  they said  you know  what  let's take  soccer  out of  this  let's  try rugby  or just  go back  to baseball  you know  we went  to the  college  last night  Binghamton  which is  a good  school  yeah  and it's  so funny  because  you can  tell  a school 
[03:09:30]  that's  no  nonsense  these  are the  the most  like  industrial  dorms  like there's  no beauty  on the  there's no  beauty in  Binghamton  anyway  it's one  of those  tough  towns  upstate  you know  it's  fucking  it's  gotten a  little  better  but yeah  it's  terrible  and the  school  is like  hardcore  you know  what I  mean  like just  a real  you  you do  good  you work  it's  like a  real  badass  it's  just a  badass  drive  but then  driving  back  I was  talking  to Dan  and it's  so funny  like  not only 
[03:10:00]  does he  know  everything  about  sports  and those  kids  I  understand  what  you're  saying  some  people  just  have  all  the  information  yeah  they get  the  stats  of  life  well  you  have  stats  on  technical  stuff  yeah  like  the  brand  new  revo  headphones  are  great  but Dan  has it  on a lot  of different  stuff  and also  all these  comedians  he starts  talking about  comedy to me  and I'm like  these guys  this generation  is encyclopedic  of comedy  comic knowledge  I had Michael  Che on last  week and he  knows everything  about every  comic  isn't it  scary  yeah  like  I didn't 
[03:10:30]  know that  they know  everybody  they know  me  they know  they know  shit about  us  that we  don't  know  I know  and it's  it's weird  I didn't  give a fuck  about anybody  but also  but also  we came from  a time  when it  wasn't like  YouTube  these guys  have been  YouTubing  in high  school  I know  I mean  who knows  maybe we  would watch  it  who knows  but  either way  I'm out  in every  porn stuff  but  they  but yeah  it's scary  how much  they know  about us  it's  uncomfortable  I think  we should  have 
[03:11:00]  maybe a  big podcast  where we sit  down with  Che and Dan  are the perfect  great examples  and go  we want  you guys  to erase  all fucking  knowledge  you have  out of us  well there's  gonna be a  problem  lose your  fucking memory  don't be  going around  telling people  oh yeah  well you know  I know  these guys  now personally  but really  that's not  what they  said in  2007  mind your  goddamn  business  worry about  something else  besides what  I fucking  said on  Tough Crowd  in 2004  I know  dude  it's  and it's  getting worse  because even 
[03:11:30]  the guys  younger than  them  there's even  more info  out there  for them  it's even  easier  there's so  much more  there's  there's  you know  five years  ago  you couldn't  get  a remote  control  all the  remote  controls  on iTunes  and  you  I mean  remember  Faces of  Death  yes  when you  had to  go get  a creepy  video  you had  to go  and see  if that  video  store  has  Blockbuster  wouldn't  carry it  because it  was too  crazy  so you  had to  find that  crazy  local 
[03:12:00]  video  store  and it  was always  out  because some  fucking  lunatic  like you  had it  I used to  watch it all  the time  I love  Faces of  Death  all you have  to do  is just  Faces of  Death  is nothing  now  I mean  nothing  you go to  one of  these  sites  beheading  sites  or whatever  the fuck  it is  it's like  it's  right there  on your  phone  walking down  the street  yeah  you see them  weird time  how about  you  and we all  have friends  that send  you  like you're  in the middle  of like  anywhere 
[03:12:30]  you know  an office  or trying  to be nice  with your  family  and suddenly  there's like  a tranny's  cock  like two  inches  away from  me  and the rest  of the  family  is like  they don't  even have  iPhones  they love  a nice  iPhone  you know  what I mean  they don't  have iPhone  they have  cheap  fucking  right  well my  family does  your family  they all  do  yeah  I'm from  a better  stock  of people  do you believe  that  you guys are  if my family  saw this  they'd be  horrified  how about  fucking  DeRosa  sends me  naked pictures  from his  balls up  all the time  I was talking 
[03:13:00]  to Esty  at the bar  a really nice  conversation  all of a sudden  my phone  goes off  and it shows  the little  picture  of what it  is  what's that  I don't know  and I click  it and it's  that fucking  Arab  the last thing  she wants to  see is an  Arab naked  yeah exactly  especially one  that she doesn't  think funny  enough to work  the club  especially one  that's alive  there's something  about driving  to a gig  and driving  back from a gig  I mean we used  to have a blast  how much fun  did we have  driving to those 
[03:13:30]  gigs  like Penn State  that time  I told Dan  I go look man  I go watch out  just watch your head  he's like why  I go just  know this  I was driving  down to Penn State  with Colin  and he just  wanted to  feel his  flesh punching  me in the head  he saw my  bald head  and he wanted  to punch me  in it  so he did  I go he  punched me  in the side  of the head  and I  fucking  I punched  him in the  leg so hard 
[03:14:00]  that he  screamed  and cried  he grabbed  the steering  wheel  at 65  and grabbed  it and pulled  it  we almost  fucking  swerved up  I spit  my coffee  on the  inner windshield  and covered  it  I had to  stick my  fucking  swollen head  out the  window  just to  pull over  so we  could wipe  the windshield  off inside  and then we  went for a  snack  we went for  food  we actually  went shopping  at a  supermarket  I remember  that too  that was a  blast  we ate 
[03:14:30]  like beasts  yeah we  had cheese  it's  I remember  you got a  box of  fucking  cheese it's  those were  good  yes  what about  that's the  beauty of  gigs  it's like  the bonding  of two  guys going  to some  gig  it's a  long drive  more than  two hours  oh absolutely  more than  two hours  where you  know you  gotta drive  and you  gotta drive  back  yeah  and then you  really get  you really  get to know  each other  you really  get to talk  and know each  other  and like you  said Dan  of course I  don't know  I mean  you know  once  well once  somebody says  they're from  Colorado  then I  kind of  shut down 
[03:15:00]  I'm like  they're not  going to have  any interesting  thing to tell  me you know  because I  just start  picturing like  a bleak  landscape  and you  know a  couple of  like  yeah  planned  communities  yeah  like a  like a  shitty  bike  yeah  some  like a  huffy  that he  has to  take  around  yeah  to the  local  billiards  yeah  or the  community  center  yeah  like that  movie  over the  top  with Matt  Dillon  remember that  movie  no I don't  remember that  you remember  over the  top  what a  fucking  movie man  what'd he  play  you know  remember  when back  in the  day when  they started  bringing up  those towns 
[03:15:30]  where everybody's  house was  the same  yeah  planned  communities  and they'd  have the  little  town  center  yeah  and they'd  have the  school  and you  know  it was  one of  those towns  and these  kids just  fucking  snapped  and they  took it  over  and locked  the parents  in the  school  and lit  the bus  on fire  and  fucking  great movie  it's probably  not as great  now  right  but it was  for me  being a  fucking  punk  yeah  it was  like my  movie  yeah  you know  what I mean  well Matt  Dillon was a  great punk  you know  I know  Matt  Dillon 
[03:16:00]  and um  he really  has  what do you  mean you  know him  I mean I  know him  as a person  as a person  or a friend  do you have  his number  no  I wouldn't  call him  a friend  but  he's friends  with friends  of mine  and  so like  if he sees  me he's like  Colin  how are you  man  Colin  how are you  right  hold on  let me try  to do  Matt  Dillon  okay  ready  I'm you  okay  you guys  give me  two slices  and a diet  coke  Colin  man  what's going  on  hey  what's up  man  how you  doing

[03:17:00]  like every  once in a while  like give us  you something  about Mary  what's funnier  than that  fucking great  what's funnier  than his performance  he's great  he stands up  and he buckles  his pants  they don't even  mention it  at the beginning  of the movie  he's sitting  behind the desk  he stands up  and just buckles  his pants  and starts talking  they don't even  mention what he  was doing  I never even  noticed that  and I'm going  to have to  go watch that  he's behind the  desk and he  stands up  and goes  well let me  tell you  something  I like Matt

[03:19:00]  dill  who's  really  still the  funniest  person  ever  but  he  lived up  there  because he  escaped  he moved  up there  they lived  up there  they moved  up there  when they  were little  because my  uncle  I guess  he was a  printer  and he got  a job  as a  printer  in Saratoga  so the  family moved  up there  from  Brooklyn  they only  he moved  up there  for two  years  and he  lost  a job  came back  to Brooklyn  then  dill  borrowed  money  off this  pretty  famous  mobs  famous  enough  mobs  who I  still don't  want to  say his  name  even though  he's  long  dead  you know  really  dill  borrowed 
[03:19:30]  money  off the  guy  he's  not  that  famous  are you  afraid  that  something  might  happen  to  you  I'm  afraid  that  his  son  might  hear  and  get  my  cousin  I'm  honored  that  you  think  my  podcast  is  popular  enough  where  I  might  affect  somebody's  life  you  never  know  well  I  do  know  I  can  show  you  the  numbers  are  great  I'm  joking  what  the  fuck  I'm  like  I thought  the  numbers  are  great  so  anyway  he  borrowed  the money  off the  guy  and of  course  didn't  pay  him  he  just  left  town  he  had to 
[03:20:00]  leave  town  of course  he  goes  back  up  to  Saratoga  where  the  horses  are  the  one  mob  guy  would  leave  New  York  City  to  go  to  it  would  be  to  Saratoga  and  he  moves  to  a  house  behind  the  back  stretch  and  one  of  the  greatest  moments  of  Dylan's  life  was  he  had  this  set  up  he  had  this  big  guy  working  for  him  this  big  upstate  country  boy  and  Dill  was  like  the  fast  talking  guy 
[03:20:30]  you  know  what  I  mean  and  the  big  guy  would  fix  cars  and  then  Dill  would  sell  them  and  then  one  time  Dill  was  out  I'm  looking  out  the  window  he's  yelling  at  these  three  like  Ecuadorian  transvestites  they're  arguing  and  Dylan  screaming  at  them  screaming  back  at  him  while  the  big  guy  is  trying  to  fix  this  car  with  a  big  breath  the  guy  has  a  back  brace  on  all the  call  work  his  back  was  shattered  and  just  watching  this  guy 
[03:21:00]  fighting  was  one  of  the  best  scenes  ever  they  have  trannies  up  there  no  because  they  were  with  the  guy  was  there  any  racing  seasons  they're  with  whoever  you know  is  he still  up  there  I  don't  know  why  that  makes  it  justifiable  no  no  they're  with  the  racing  oh  okay  yeah  he's  still  up  there  yeah  Ecuadorian  trannies  aren't  the  hottest  by the  way  why  what  Phillies  Filipinos  Filipinos  I would 
[03:21:30]  like  that's  like  apocalypto  trannies  like  little  flat face  trannies  oh  you  fear  me  is  that  real  are  you  making  that  up  no  that's  I'm  just  making  up  when  a  girl  starts  yelling  at  him  one  of  the  greatest  scariest  creepy  things  in a  movie  ever  how  great  was  that  movie  I 
[03:22:00]  mean  not  one  lick  of  fucking  you  gotta  watch  this  shit  with  subtitles  I'm  not  a  subtitle  guy  the  movie  has  to  be  really  good  to  get  me  to  fucking  do  that  really  good  that  I  agree  with  you  that  is  the  most  underrated  movie  of  all  time  of  all  time  it's  so  brilliant  same  thing  it's  an  action  movie  and  you  can  watch  it  what  what  kind  of  subtitle  I  like  subtitle  movies  but  guess  what  if  a  subtitle  movie  is  on  after  I  saw  it 
[03:22:30]  once  I'm  not  like  oh  I  gotta  keep  watching  this  every  time  it's  on  I  can't  leave  the  screen  I  cannot  not  watch  it  yeah  it's  it  starts  out  it's  like  good  fellas  for  indigenous  tribes  what  do you  want  a  panther  what  do you  want  a  panther  so  so  it's  so  fucking  great  and  this  lunatic  I  mean  threw  it  all  away  because 
[03:23:00]  of  his  whatever  the  fucking  religious  beliefs  well  that's  one  interpretation  I  would  say  that  he  was  full  that  that  he  didn't  throw  it  all  he  obviously  whatever  he said  I'm  saying  he  didn't  do  anything  what  he  said  was  offensive  but  to have  this  guy  be  pushed  aside  that  to have  that  brilliant  movie  be  pushed  aside  because  of  what  he  said  it's  a  little  too  much  in my  opinion  passion  of the  Christ  same  passion  of  Christ  yeah 
[03:23:30]  oh  my  god  not  I  mean  of  course  apocalypto  is  I  would  put  way  above  it  but  oh  that  little  girl  why  doesn't  that  little  girl  get  an  Oscar  well  any  anybody  that  wants  to  see  if  you  haven't  seen  apocalypto  trust  me  we're  not  just  two  guys  telling  you  this  this  movie  is  unbelievable  I mean  we are  just  two  guys  telling  you  that  I  take  that  back  we  actually  are  two  guys  in  somebody  else's  bedroom  minding  your  business  and telling  you  you gotta  see  but 
[03:24:00]  that  movie  is  so  brilliant  and  if  I'm 
[03:24:30]  not  about  is  it  they  showed  you  how  I  don't  know  how  factual  it  was  but  I  would  assume  that  it  had  like  the  way  they  made  the  pyramids  the  way  those  workers  were  and  with  the  bodies  just  thrown  away  I mean  the  sacrifices  I've  been  to  Guatemala  I've  been  to  Guatemala  City 
[03:25:00]  is  covers  all  those  pyramids  like  if  you  were  to  dig  under  the  houses  and  the  buildings  there's  pyramids  there  those  fucking  pyramids  and I  went to  a site  right in  Guatemala  City  it's  right on  some  fucking  street  it looks  like a  park  you go  in  you pay  a dollar  and they're  slowly  uncovering  a temple  and it  would just  it just  happened  is 2000  years  you know  the dirt  and the  trees  and the  leaves  fall 
[03:25:30]  and people  die  and things  and it  covers  and covers  and covers  and then  all of a  sudden  there's  you know  20 feet  of dirt  on a  on a  it would  be like  covering this  building  you know  years from  now  this  building  won't  be here  it'll  be under  dirt  and the  new  building  will be  on top  of it  or whatever  right  you know  what I mean  yeah  so I  went there  and I was  like oh my  and they  were telling  me this  is where  they probably  sacrificed  people  and this  is where  the king  was  or the  whatever  the fucking  Mayan  yeah  yeah  yeah  it was  pretty crazy  I picked  up a  knife  off the  ground  a obsidian 
[03:26:00]  knife  really  yeah  like they  they used  to get  it's the  the lava  rock  you know  it's a  glass  and they  would chip  it off  and it  would it  just chips  off into  almost like  a blade  and they  would use  that to  cut the  fruit  to cut  into animal  flesh  and shit  like that  the lava  rock  does  yeah  obsidian  it's called  obsidian  wow  and they  would use  that for  knives  you can  walk around  I found  a bull  in the  ground  like on  the  I walked  down this  cliff  near a  tree  and there's 
[03:26:30]  a piece  of pottery  sticking out  of the  ground  from a  thousand  years ago  just  crazy  and you  found  it  wait a  minute  yeah  so  what did  you  did you  bring it  to somebody  and have  it priced  well  here's the  thing  it's not  worth  not really  worth any  because it's  little pieces  it's not the  whole thing  well the  knife  well  the knife  well here  I took  I pocketed  a bunch  of the  obsidian  knives  right  and a  couple  pieces  of the  clay  pots  as my  little  thing  and I  was in  the airport  and I  got food  poisoning  the night  before  and I 
[03:27:00]  was shitting  and pissing  you know  just  fucking  violently  all night  and I  was sweating  and I  was going  through the  customs  and I  had  this shit  on me  in my  pocket  and I  was  delusional  yeah  I'm sweating  and I'm like  they're gonna  stop me  they're gonna  pat me  down  so the  first chance  I got  I just  went to  the bathroom  and there  was a  bathroom  attendant  in there  and I  wrapped it  in  and I'm  throwing up  I'm  shitting  I'm on  the floor  and then I  just said  fuck this  I don't want  this on  me  I wrapped  it in  toilet  paper  and I 
[03:27:30]  threw  it in  the garbage  but he  just emptied  the garbage  and these  two  TSA  type guys  walk in  in the  uniform  and I  drop it  in the  garbage  and there  was nothing  in it  so you  just  clang  hilarious  and I  just  was like  I'm  going to  jail  I'm  dead  but I  found it  if they  found it  they would  have  been  like  go  fuck  yourself  it's  not  it's  not  a  panther  pot  you  know  what I  mean  do you  think  that story  was too  long  a little  bit  do you  ever hear  of Montezuma's 
[03:28:00]  revenge  yes  and you  know what  that is  yes  what  it's  when you  shit your  pants  right  but why  because  I didn't  he caught  you got me  are you  fucking  happy  though  because  it's  related  to what  you're  saying  you  had  the  most  literal  version  of  Montezuma's  revenge  ever  Montezuma  was the  king  yeah  of those  Mayans  or Inc  isn't  one  of  those  right  yeah  so  when  people  had  conquered  him  whatever  destroyed  his  great  civilization 
[03:28:30]  they always  get the  shits  right  but you  literally  took  you  defiled  the  property  of  Montezuma's  pyramid  settle down  in case  people  listen  remember  your  mob  guy  thing  same  thing  with  the  government  what  do you  think  I'm  crazy  well  who  knows  what  do you  think  do you  think  the  mob  guy  is  going  to  kill  your  cousin  do you  think  gaudy  was it  gaudy  no  no  no  no  hey  no  names  no  names 
[03:29:00]  but  Montezuma  literally  you  defiled  when you  started  picking up  those  objects  that's  why you  got sick  that night  maybe  I mean  it could  be  that I  I'm  a fucking  asshole  and I  tried to  eat  Guatemala  like I  was  fucking  on a  travel  channel  show  I  remember  Jack  Vaughn  you know  he's  the head  of  comedy  central  records  at the  time  he  took  me  and  I  kept  going  all right  what are  we  gonna  eat  he's  like  I  don't  know  Bobby  he  doesn't  go  there  to 
[03:29:30]  eat  he  goes  there  to  see  these  beautiful  places  and  go  to  the  markets  and  I  mean  just  travel  through  the  fucking  back roads  of  Guatemala  which  is  very  dangerous  at  times  and  beautiful  and  combination  he  looks  like  the  only  way  he  would  not  get  attacked  is  because  you  might  think  this  guy's  got to  be  a  CIA  agent  he  looks  like  he  should 
[03:30:00]  be  sitting  in  a  meeting  with  Pat  Dixon  they  should  both  be  in  like  Battle  Creek  Michigan  in  the  middle  of  a  stupid  board  room  at  Hilton  Suites  we  actually  came up  with  this  great  show  idea  that  he  at  the  beginning  of  the  thing  they  show  me  with  tats  and  a  knife  and  all  that  shit  and  then  it  spins  and  one  guy  is  going  to  take  the  novice  into  the  jungle  and  discover  what 
[03:30:30]  outside  of  America  is  but  it's  him  and  he  puts  the  hat  on  and  gets  the  whip  because  he  was taught  by  Navy  SEALs  in  high  school  how  to  get  through  road  blocks  because  he  grew  two  plane  crashes  and  seven  assassination  attempts  wow  was he  an  ambassador  his  father  was  he  worked  for  the  United  States  government  I don't  know  but  in  Guatemala  for  something  I don't  know  what  it  was  but  yes  not 
[03:31:00]  an  ambassador  something  like that  it was  crazy  when he  lived  there  he  had  some  crazy  his  father  and  him  have  crazy  stories  and  you're  like  I  can't  believe  it  I  remember  driving  at  one  point  I  looked  over  and  I  was  so  scared  because  the  night  before  we're  going  to  Guatemala  I  read  don't  go  to  Guatemala  I  told  you  that  night  right  it  said  don't  go  on  the  website  the  United  States  hey  if  you're  going  to  Guatemala  don't  go  you  don't  have  to  yeah 
[03:31:30]  I  remember  I  ran  I  got  two  money  belts  right  but  I  was  too  fat  for  a  money  belt  because  it  goes  me  getting  the  money  out  of  the  money  belt  which  defeated  the  purpose  of  the  money  belt  and  I  was  so  paranoid  I  had  400  cash  which  you  don't  need  400  in  Guatemala  you  can  literally  become  the  governor  of a  small  town  with  400  cash  in  Guatemala  I  bring  400  cash  because  I'm  going  to  buy  things  I'm 
[03:32:00]  a  tech  guy  what  am I  going  to get  down  there  right  so  I  go  down  400  years  the  sun  setting  it's  like  the  old  400  years  ago  is  what  it  is  with  tourists  you  go  into  this  restaurant  and  it's  outdoors  and  I  go  up  I'm  going  to  the  bathroom  and  I'm  checking  my  money  every  10 
[03:32:30]  minutes  because  I'm  so  scared  because  Jack  said  to  me  listen  man  they  can  steal  your  underwear  at  this  place  the  pick  pockets  so  be  careful  so  I  check  it  in  the  toilet  I  go  downstairs  we  eat  I'm  like  you  know  sauce  I  eat  what's  the  biggest  plate  you  got  give me  the  combo  plate  I  want  to  try  what  they  don't  fucking  just  eat  you  fat  gringo  yeah  right  we  leave  we're  on  the  road  it's  raining  we're  in  the  jungle  there's  a point  where  he  looks  at me  he  goes  look  dude  for  the  next  15  minutes  if  I  say  we're  going  we're  going 
[03:33:00]  so  just  look  at  man  this  is  a  dangerous  this  is  when  you  were  saying  could  something  happen  here  something  could  happen  here  and  then  we  wound  up  on  dead  dog  highway  and  I  was  like  why  is  it  called  dead  dog  and  then  we  run  over  a  fucking  dead  dog  you  know  what I  mean  and  then  I  go  to  get  my  money  out  of  my  money  belt  gone  hundred  dollars  in 
[03:33:30]  the  bathroom  oh  American  oh  my  god  it  probably  I'd like  to go  back  and try  to find  that guy  and see  what  happened  he might  have  become  a new  guy  I  guarantee  the  restaurant  has  new  like a  new  front  door  new  name  yeah  do you  ever  think  about  doing  shows  like  that  like  traveling  I  mean  you  know  my  favorite  when we  had a  blast  going  to  Japan  going  to  Iraq  I  mean  we  had  a  blast  traveling  that  was  fun  it  was  it  was  fun  it  flying  on a 
[03:34:00]  plane  with  you  is  not  fun  no  no  you  shut  you're  weird  on a  plane  dude  you're  you  I  wish  I  could  almost  do  what  you  do  on  a  plane  yeah  I  go  right  to  sleep  it's  fucking  crazy  you  go  in  first  of  all  you're  like  homeless  when you  get to  the  airport  like  you  have  a  bag  with  a  shirt  sticking  out  of  it  yeah  but  you  lack  nothing  you  have  everything  you  have  there's  nothing  you  for some  reason  you've  got it  everything  it's  like  there's  no  I 
[03:34:30]  I've  been up  for days  I have  the best  suitcase  I have  a backpack  that turns  into a  shoulder bag  that has  a battery  in it  I have  and you  just show  the fuck  up  I know  you packed  the flights  at six  you packed  at  fucking  four  fifty  eight  you  and I  I was  at the  airport  two  hours  early  I'm  at  the  gate  with  my  fucking  latte  I'm  ready  to go  with a  thing  around  my  neck  that  has  my  passport  and  then  my  phone  and  you  show  up  with  a  shirt  hanging  out 
[03:35:00]  of  a  bag  and a  jacket  on  your  shirt  and a  hoodie  and  you  woke  up  an  hour  and a  half  maybe  an  hour  ago  and  you  made  it  you  there  you  get  right  the  new  fucking  sleeper  seat  from  American  Airlines  and  it  has  a  14  inch  plasma  that  has  all  the  movies  that  just  came  out  with 
[03:35:30]  private  interviews  to  American  airline  customers  and  then  whatever  you want  for dinner  like  anything  personal  pizza  not even  like a  14  inch  pizza  with  Sundays  and  you  will  fucking  put  that  hood  over  your  head  lie  back  and  go  the  fuck  to  sleep  and  you  wake  up  40  minutes  before  we're  landing  you  get  a  smile  on  your  dumb  face  and  you're  ready  to  go  yeah  that's 
[03:36:00]  pretty  much  it  and  but  how  about  how  about  the  I  would  love  to  have  traveled  more  that's  one  of  the  biggest  things  I  regret  you know  I was  thinking  about  you know  I always  tell  people  the  story  of  like  you  got  banned  from  from  I got  banned  from  Afghanistan  and Iraq  and the  story is  that you  know  I said  something  when they  told me  not to  speak  what do  you mean  you know  like I  made jokes  about the  Afghani  the boy  hunting  I don't  really know  the fucking  I don't  know the  story  I heard  I've been  told two  different  stories 
[03:36:30]  one  this  and then  you told  me another  story  where you  didn't  know  what  happened  yet  you  thought  it  was  a  tell  and  they  just  banded  you  by  accident  no  somebody  else  might have  said  that  so  all right  so  it's  you  what was  it  here  well  there's  two  there's  two  versions  one  is  the  version  that  I  said  some  things  about  you know  the boy  hunting  the habits  the proclivities  of  the Afghani  guys  to go  and you  know  fuck  young  boys  and you  know  proclivities  yeah  go ahead  to bang  the young  boys  thank you 
[03:37:00]  thank you  remember  who's  listening  me  and the  and that  the one  story  that makes  sense  on a certain  level  because I  did say  things  that they  told me  don't say  that  right  because I  just couldn't  help it  but the  story that's  probably  closer to  the truth  is that  the person  that ran  it  who will  remain  nameless  since I  think  everybody  listens to  your podcast  the person  that ran  named it  on my  last trip  with Nick  DiPaolo  and Bobby  Kelly  the person  that ran  it  was 
[03:37:30]  starting to  aggravate  us  so one  night  we're outside  of a room  and uh  we start  to talk  about  talk shit  about her  Bob  would you  like to  take it  from here  look  this lady  is used  to people  who are  grateful  who are  there  to  help  the troops  who are  there for  one mission  and one  mission only  to you  know  musicians  or actors  or she's  used to  people who  are there  you know 
[03:38:00]  she's not  used to  self-centered  ball-busting  east coast  fucking  shit dicks  who only  care about  two things  eating  laughing  that's all  we care  about  we show  up and  this poor  heavy set  woman  had to put  up with  our shit  and she's  very regimented  very military  yes  very military  and we're  not military  guys  we don't  like taking  orders  and one  of us  didn't like 
[03:38:30]  taking orders  and especially  from a big  woman  well woman  and then a  big woman  one of us  there's three  of us  so I remember  we're on this  we're on this  bus  and she's  she started  day two  fucking with  me and  Nick  and busting  balls a little  bit  kind of  fucking with  us  and saying  shit  and we don't  take to that  either  we do that  to each other  it's like  when you fans  like one of  you guys  will say  something  terrible  on Twitter  and then we  block you  and you get  mad 
[03:39:00]  and it's like  oh just kidding  we don't like  it from you  we only like  it from each  other  and she did  some shit  and she was  you know  let's go  kind of  talking to us  strong  and we're  out in front  of our house  it was a  beautiful night  in actually  Fuji, Japan  at the bottom  of Mount Fuji  one of the  most beautiful  places in the  world  a beautiful night  too  yeah we were  there  soft wind  summer wind  un-fucking  believable  and we're  sitting there  trashing her 
[03:39:30]  like you know  she fucking  does this  I'm being fucking  trashing her  yeah and then  I looked up  and meanwhile  no but I'm  the guy  like I'm the guy  trying to calm  these guys down  and I'm going  look guys  look at it  from her perspective  she's this fat  lonely thing  oh god  I start talking  about calling her  fat  calling her lonely  I go  I know she's a  fucking pain in the ass  but look at her  she's got nothing  going  oh it was brutal  and then I look up  and then  fuck it  I see  I see the screen 
[03:40:00]  there was no window  it was just screen  I see  I can see the  the shiny glass  was pushed up  and I point up  just to the pussy  I am  I went  the window's open  guys  and every  and as soon as I said it  we all went  oh shit  we all clammed up  and then we looked  and we saw two little  fat feet coming down  the stairs  we got busted  and it was like  we're all grown men  sincerely  I'm in my  I'm the youngest  of the group 
[03:40:30]  I'm in my mid-30s  and we all got scared  we even  DiPaolo  I don't know  and then she comes out  she comes out  and confronts us  confronts us  but in a very  hey listen  if I've stepped over  any boundaries  I apologize  I'm just trying  to do my job  I thought that maybe  that's what you guys liked  and I was just trying  to assimilate  to make things easier  but I have a schedule  and my job  is to make sure  you get where you go  because these troops  are important to me  and I know they're  important to you  so I apologize 
[03:41:00]  and it will not happen again  then she steps back in  and before she shut the door  the door opens back up  and she puts her head  back up  and she goes  but next time you want  to talk shit about somebody  don't do it under  their open window  and then DiPaolo goes  nah there goes  that fucking apology  yes  and I was like  god damn it  god damn  god damn it  I don't know how we got  so my second theory  is how I got banned  is they probably  might have been like  hey you worked  with this guy 
[03:41:30]  was that  was he a problem  because he did  this one thing  we don't know  and she was like  she did what I would  have done  under the circumstances  fuck him  right  that cocksucker  tell him to go  fuck him  so it could have  been either one  who knows  well you know  look  she actually was cool  the second time  I went back  with you  when we went to Iraq  yeah  we had a way better  time with her  I think  I think  we didn't have any  problems with her  I remember  no it's true  with Steve Byrne 
[03:42:00]  you mean  yeah Steve Byrne  that was a fun trip  that was a blast  that was so good  man  and then  yeah  I went back  with Dane  I remember  when we were  flying into Fallujah  to drop off ammo  and I leaned over  to you  I go  hey man  you know how famous  you are when you  you know  you know how famous  you are when you  they have you  making a pit stop  in the fucking  SUNY Triangle  with ammo  on the plane  you think Bob Hope  ever did that  oh I remember that  listen  yeah we're gonna take  we're gonna take  Burt Reynolds down 
[03:42:30]  and the SUNY Triangle  Flares was shooting  out of the plane  yeah  yeah they didn't  give a fuck about us  oh no  no  remember when Steve Byrne  when I turned to Steve Byrne  when they were shooting  those things up  they thought there was like  they said if this goes off  that's gonna happen  and then they start  shooting off the thing  it's like something  and I go Steve  and he looks at me  I go Steve  at least I kinda made it  with you will never know  he just looked at me  how's this though  how's this  is that they brought  you guys up front  and she didn't bring me  remember that 
[03:43:00]  oh no  I thought we switched off  she would always  leave me behind  oh  I'm not even kidding dude  and I'll be honest  with you now  it hurt me  so bad  it hurt me  like  it was the pain  of my  my existence  like if I could say  what was the thing  that pained you  the most in your life  not being picked  by people  that should pick me  I like that 
[03:43:30]  and she  I like that  I remember when she came back  and she probably knew it  and she went  Colin  they were like  Colin you wanna come up front  yeah  and she went  Steve  cause she loved  cause here's those people in life  look I love Steve  you know that  I have nothing bad about Steve  and Dan is one of those guys too  and these  these guys that come up  and I call them neutrals  you know what I mean  where everybody loves them  you know what I mean  you know Dan is  corporate Dan  nobody's not gonna like Dan  until he fucking snaps 
[03:44:00]  yeah  and he's not gonna snap  yeah right  I  there's something about me  well Patrice said it  you're not  Bruce Banner  trying to be the Hulk  you're the Hulk  trying to be Bruce Banner  well put  okay  very well put  just be the Hulk  right  you know  yeah  and I remember she came back  and she was like  Steve  oh  and they just left me there  and I was so mad  I could have cried  Colin  I could cry right now  thinking about it  honestly God 
[03:44:30]  I could  if I really  thought about it  I could tear up  because I remember  I was just sitting there  by myself  in that little fucking  net seating in the C-130  and I've like  I've always  I've always wanted  but I'm  me and Colin  are really good friends  right  like he doesn't really know  Steve's here  because Steve asked him  and Steve's brother's here  right  I'm friends with this  motherfucker  right  you fuck  but she liked Steve  better than me  she did  abso-fucking-lutely did  and I remember  she picked him up there 
[03:45:00]  and then  I went  I finally got my shot  I think  two more times later  right  but it was like  Robert  do you want to go  almost like  do you want to go too  well she was still  probably mad  from our last trip  but I didn't do anything  but wait a minute  what  no you were talking shit too  what do you mean  you didn't do anything  in case she listened  to this podcast  and she doesn't remember  who did what  I didn't do anything  it was all Nick DiPaolo  it was all Nick  but we went on  the Japan trip first  and then we went to Iraq  we went to Japan first  which was awesome 
[03:45:30]  it wasn't look  how do you say this  without fucking  sounding  look I love  supporting the troops  anywhere  yeah  I'll go to fucking Jersey  I don't give a shit  I'll go upstate New York  I've done it  but  when we went to Iraq  it's something about  your life being in danger too  that makes it  somehow  like okay  I'm really  I'm really doing something now  that's how they call it  the theater  the war  the theater  but Japan was fun  I remember we  beautiful  the kid was on the bus  with us  that Navy kid 
[03:46:00]  yeah  and he was  he was you know  interviewing or whatever  oh yeah  and I remember he  oh yeah  he was asking me  he was just talking  for two hours straight  just about politics  and  yeah  and I was like  do you believe in this  and  you were quiet  you were typing  on your little white Mac  yes  because you had  you were always writing  right  and then DiPaolo  was writing in a notebook  trying to keep up with you  well if Quinn's writing  I got a fucking right  cock sucker  I want to take a nap 
[03:46:30]  but this fucking asshole  is setting the curve  cock fucking sucker  and then  remember that kid  and then around  an hour and a half in  yes  I remember exactly  I go  Bob's peppering him  with questions  Bobby gives him  like five in a row  blah blah blah  he was like  blah blah blah  and the kid was like  kind of a young  maybe 19 year old  kind of pretty boy kid  you know  kind of you know  and then suddenly  Bob goes  do you ever suck a cock  out of nowhere  and the kid goes  uh  and what did he say 
[03:47:00]  no  right  no why would you ask that  but he said no  in a way that meant  we took as a yes  oh yeah  yeah  no have you  do you want me to  yeah  yeah that was a lot of fun man  I was like  Jesus Christ  I wish we could  I wish we could tour together again  what's he gonna go soon  yeah  you got five more minutes  yeah  what time you gonna be out of here  let me  7.30  I got you  um  I wish we could go on  that's one thing I  I hate  is that we  we're all  yeah 
[03:47:30]  we're all out  spread out over the fucking world  trying to  and we  you know  I'm over here  and you're over there  and Norman's over there  and you know  DePaulo's over there  you know  it would be great  if we could just say  fuck it  let's just go  we'll do a theater  we'll split the fucking money  yeah  or whatever gives a fuck  well I mean  I don't know  it sucks that we  we have so much fun together on the road  there's nothing better than being in a hotel room  with your other comic friends  getting breakfast  walking around the stupid town 
[03:48:00]  some of us getting noticed  some of us not  and there's nothing worse  than when it's just you out by yourself  I mean you get a little work done I guess  but it's not the same  it's not fun  like you  like you said  that feeling when you're in your hotel room  but you know your friends are down the hole  it's like being a kid  yeah  it's like being a kid again  yeah  yeah it's the fucking best feeling  knowing that  you're gonna wake up  where you wanna go  go get some food  get to sleep  do the show  after the show  you go out somewhere  plus knowing you only have to do about 25 minutes 
[03:48:30]  there's no pressure  there's no pressure  no anxiety  it's sold out  cause we all fucking just put it together  and  and it's just  it's beautiful  it sucks that we can't do that anymore  and there's so many people  dude why don't you guys just  oh we can't  they say it all the time  you can't  everybody has different agents  everybody has different bills  and everybody pulls different tickets  yeah  yeah  do you sell good on the road?  um  in some towns  I'm no Jim Norton  but I do okay  what about Norton 
[03:49:00]  I tell you that great Iraq story right?  when he left  at the end  oh  no that was psychopathic  yeah  we'll explain it now  he at the end  there were two weeks in Iraq  in the theater  we're in the theater  early on  at the beginning  2003  at the fucking beginning  when it was real dangerous  2003  we go there for two weeks  me, him, Lori come on  and at the end of the tour  we're all coming back  right?  it's me, Lori  and maybe  oh  and uh 
[03:49:30]  so we're all coming back  and we get to the airport  you know  you kind of bond  you know  you're over there  a couple of weeks together  day and night  constantly  in the same rooms  in the same  you know  and we get off the plane  we go to get our bags  and then  Norton's bag  is on the other carousel  this is a JFK  so he gets his bag  and then I see him walking  I start laughing  because he was being funny  he takes his bag  like you know  you get up to  he's gonna say goodbye  he takes his bag  and just  while we're waiting  for our bags  doesn't turn around 
[03:50:00]  and look at us  walks out  towards the  you know  the cars  to get a car  and go back to Manhattan  so I start laughing  like that's funny  you know what I mean  he gets in the car  and leaves  so then I was like  that's even funnier  this son of a bitch  actually committed  to fucking being the asshole  that doesn't say goodbye  after two weeks  of bonding with people  in a war zone  in a war zone  and be on planes  for hours together  in all these different places  and meet all these experiences  I go that's fucking  even funnier  the balls to pull that bullshit 
[03:50:30]  to be that dick  I call him later  I go hey what's up  he's like yeah  or I saw him the next day  and I was like hey  fucking fuck  he goes what  I go  you fucking  I realized  he didn't even  he wasn't doing a character  he was just being an asshole  that didn't say goodbye  to people  that he just spent  two weeks with  I guarantee he had  some massage showing up  that's what he said  but so what  you don't not  he didn't even  wave goodbye  if you have a massage 
[03:51:00]  you go guys  I'm so sorry  we'll catch up later  or tomorrow  you don't just  fucking turn your back  on people  and walk out  it's fucking  what did he do  over there  that's my story  you told me  what was the other thing  that he did  I don't know  the original thing  that you came up with  well one thing he did  I don't know if this  is what you mean  but  you brought up the story  you were like  no no no  did over there  well on New Year's Eve  one time  it was New Year's Eve  we were over there 
[03:51:30]  for New Year's  it was right  the thing I regret  to this day  is that Manny  passed away  during the time  we were there  right  but we couldn't  cancel  you know  but it was just  ugh  I guess it was  the end of 2003  and um  but Norton  New Year's Eve  I think we just  found out about  Manny that day  and she goes to us  Tracy  yeah  she goes  look guys  there's a little bit  of a problem  there's been some  you know  missile attacks  so there might not  be a show tonight  we were supposed  to do a show  we ended up  doing a show  but she said 
[03:52:00]  so there's a chance  we might have to  cancel a show  we're in these barracks  she goes  they're shooting missiles  at the base  so for the troops  to get over there  could be a problem  right  so I'm like  yeah I get it  you know  I'm the fucking headliner  and nobody knows  Norton at the time  suddenly a bee  starts buzzing around  muttering to itself  it was like  I hear a buzzing sound  like I thought  there was a bee  loose in the fucking thing  there's nobody  in the barracks  except me  him  and Lloyd  come on  and just  what's that sound  I see  turning around 
[03:52:30]  and walking around  in fucking circles  like a fucking  like a silent movie star  like when it speeded up  the film  walking around  buzzing to himself  muttering  is this god damn  fucking  tadpole  I go what  I've never missed  a new year's show  in 12 years  what  I've  no  I've never missed  a new year's show  I've done a show  every new year's  for 12 years  oh  well I'm glad  we know what  this trip is about  your shitty record
