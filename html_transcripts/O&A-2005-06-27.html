<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' typical chaotic banter, heavily laced with profanity and vulgar humor.  Opie recounted a recent car break-in, detailing the stolen items (XM satellite radio, change, phone charger, and a police badge) and his frustration at the lack of assistance from bystanders.  This incident led him to question his liberal viewpoints. A caller then shared a similar experience, adding the particularly disgusting detail of fecal matter being left in their car.  The conversation shifted to a recent shark attack on a teenage girl, with graphic descriptions of the injuries.  The hosts discussed the frequency of such attacks, media sensationalism, and the overall likelihood of being attacked by a shark.

Jim Norton joined the show, recounting his weekend judging a "Babe Fest" bikini contest alongside Gene Simmons and Bam Margera. He detailed a past negative encounter with Simmons, followed by an unexpectedly positive interaction at Babe Fest, which included a bizarre intervention by a fan who defended Norton against Simmons' previous slight.  The discussion then returned to Norton's prior confrontation with Simmons, stemming from an incident in Vegas where Simmons refused a photo. This escalated into a confrontation at a YSP event, resolved only when a fan aggressively intervened, resulting in a picture of Norton and Simmons together. The hosts then discussed the censorship policies of their website, expressing frustration with restrictions on sexually explicit content while graphic violence was permitted, citing John Ashcroft's policies as an example of this hypocrisy.  They mocked Norton's physique using a picture on their website, leading to vulgar jokes about his appearance and his experiences at BabeFest, including girls spitting in his mouth.  Technical difficulties with the MiFi audio feed were discussed, followed by a rapid-fire segment touching on teen boob jobs, Gay Pride events, and the New York Yankees, culminating in a profane Opie rant about the Yankees' management.

Norton then recounted a disastrous show in D.C. due to a promoter's deceptive overselling of the event, leading to angry patrons and negative feedback. He described the promoter's actions, his own frustration, and the steps taken to address the situation with disgruntled fans. Listener calls followed, addressing the D.C. incident. A seemingly unrelated segment then discussed the military's potential use of XM satellite radio during crises, interspersed with nonsensical humor and sound effects.

A significant portion of the show covered an article criticizing Opie and Anthony's humor, written by Todd Hargosh, a gaming website writer.  Hargosh accused them of racism and sexism, particularly targeting their jokes about Sirius XM. Opie and Anthony vehemently defended their humor, arguing it was exaggerated and honest, and also discussed their rivalry with Howard Stern, implying past restrictions on discussing Stern influenced their current commentary.  The show then played audio clips from their team's interviews at the New York City Gay Pride Parade, featuring vulgar and sexually explicit language from both the interviewees and the hosts.  This prompted a discussion comparing the parade's presentation to those of other ethnic groups, questioning whether its overt sexuality was beneficial to the gay rights movement.  The hosts repeatedly insulted Hargosh using offensive language and detailed analysis of his writing style.

The discussion about the Gay Pride parade continued, with one host arguing that its overly sexualized nature contributed to negative public perception. This sparked a debate on the gay communityâ€™s image and whether a "more positive" presentation would be more effective.  The conversation touched on the hosts' conflicted relationship with Gene Simmons, highlighting inconsistencies in public personas.  Callers contributed to the discussion, with one from Alabama offering a surprising perspective on the state's tolerance towards the gay community.  Another caller suggested that showcasing certain aspects of the gay community in the Pride parade might alienate potential supporters. The conversation repeatedly veered into offensive and sexually explicit territory, with jokes about various ethnic groups, sexual acts, death, AIDS, lynchings, necrophilia, and miscarriages.  A lengthy segment of morbid humor surrounded a Paul McCartney news item about his wife's miscarriage, fueled by both hosts and callers.  The show also mentioned upcoming guests Jim Gaffigan and Paul Anka, discussed other radio programs copying their "Assault on the Media" segment, and delved into further discussion of teen breast augmentation surgeries, playing audio clips of interviews with teenagers, parents, and surgeons.  Finally,  a crude and sexually explicit joke told by Brother Joe about Lady McCartney having a prosthetic leg concluded the show abruptly.

[00:00:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want the best!  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  Don't do it!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head. 
[00:04:30]  Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  You need to shut the fuck up.  Asshole. 
[00:05:00]  Asshole.  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  This is a giant cock.  Hello, exactly.  You're a filthy whore.  What the fuck is, idiot.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:05:30]  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  Hey, I should have stayed home and played with myself.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  Uh-oh.  Yes.  I sound a little over-modulated.  Are you?  A little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  Got to crank it down?  I don't know.  Something must have happened over the weekend.  You think? 
[00:06:00]  Someone screw with anything?  No?  Yeah, they screwed with my car.  Yeah, well, I don't think that was anybody that works here.  That was a fucking bummer on Friday.  That's what happens when you live around the criminal element, Opie.  You got to move out to a compound.  You got to get the gated compound.  What happened?  I have a little problem.  Just a little bit after Friday's show.  And Friday we were talking about how I live in a safe neighborhood. 
[00:06:30]  Although I have to have bars on my windows like everybody else because you don't want  Spidey coming into your apartment and raping you.  Spider-Man.  Spider-Man.  Because rape is fun, kids.  Yeah, it's the Spider-Man rapist.  It's the Spidey rapist.  He's the fun one.  Sure, they make toys and Pez dispensers like Spider-Man.  It's all about fun.  So Spidey rapist has to be fun, too.  The paper is a bunch of assholes that run them.  The Spidey rapist.  Might be a pizza delivery guy.  Yeah, now they got a picture of the guy.  He's still working, by the way. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Didn't Spider-Man, Peter Parker, deliver pizzas in the beginning of the first?  Oh, very good.  The second one?  Yes, he did.  I do remember that.  Yes, he did.  Maybe this guy is the Spider-Man rapist.  Well, supposedly this pizza guy, he, I don't know, he broke into some lady's apartment  and watched her or something, I don't know.  And he's still on the job delivering pizzas.  So now they're thinking he might be the Spidey rapist.  Who's taking upskirt pictures of girls or something like that.  Was he really?  Yeah, so he might be, he's denying it, though.  That old gag.  Yeah.  Is that really a turn-on? 
[00:07:30]  He says he's the Batman butt-fucker.  It's different.  That's his gag?  Than the Spider-Man rapist.  So I don't know.  So we were just talking about that on Friday, where most of the people on the Upper West Side  and stuff have to, you know, it's a safe neighborhood, but you have to have bars on all your windows.  It's a safe neighborhood, but you have to have bars anyway.  You know what the fact of the matter is?  It's not a safe neighborhood.  It's in Manhattan.  It's a nice neighborhood in Manhattan that you still have to be just as careful in as you do anywhere else in Manhattan. 
[00:08:00]  It's just, that's the way it is.  If it was a safe neighborhood, you wouldn't need bars on your windows,  and you wouldn't have to drive to different cities around this country with no XM satellite radio.  Yeah, that's the kicker, man.  But, yeah, you want to get some fresh air in your apartment because, you know, it's summer and stuff,  so you're going to leave it open at night?  You open up all the windows and lift the shades, and you get to look out through the bars.  Through the bars on your windows.  It's ridiculous.  It's like you're living at Rikers.  So after Friday's show, we're all happy. 
[00:08:30]  We thought we had a pretty good week of radio, and Friday's show was stellar.  Stellar?  Stellar, Jesus.  And I guess we're lifting the ban on women for now?  Yeah, that was pretty good.  As long as it goes like that, fine with it.  No more begging, pleading.  But that's so refreshing to not have girls come in here and have to beg to get nothing  and then have them leave, and you're all disappointed and angry.  I was thinking, and I'm serious, Steve has to do this. 
[00:09:00]  I want a demo tape of what the girls are supposed to do on this show.  What do you mean, like video?  Either video or, yeah, video and the audio for the radio as well.  Yeah, because I want the women to understand exactly what they have to do, more or less,  before they walk through that studio door, because Friday was great.  Friday was awesome.  I don't know.  What do you want me to do?  Take your clothes off.  Well, no, I don't do that.  Out.  Get out. 
[00:09:30]  That was great Friday.  Yeah, so I want a demo tape.  When the girls say, what do you want us to do?  We play the tape.  We show them the tape.  Right.  Are you capable of doing anything like this?  If not, goodbye.  Bye-bye.  You're not going to sit on Jim Norton's lap all, you know, fully dressed, flirting and stuff.  No.  Isn't that great?  No.  Because Friday worked like a charm.  And the videos are up on foundrymusic.com, openanthony.com, pictures, videos, and they're  being downloaded like crazy. 
[00:10:00]  So you can see what you heard yet on Friday's show.  Yeah.  I guess it was Family Guy last night had a spitting in the mouth line.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Do we have that clip?  Spit in my mouth.  Spit in his mouth.  I thought that was odd that that just popped up.  Yeah.  So very happy after Friday's show, and I decide, hey, I'm going to go to the ocean for the  day.  I'm going to get in my fine vehicle and go to the ocean for the day.  Go to the ocean. 
[00:10:30]  So I get some wraps and some drinks.  Ooh, a whole day of it.  A whole day.  Maybe go see the family out on Long Island.  That's nice.  A whole day in my car.  You say go to the ocean, though?  You don't just say go to the beach?  Go to the ocean.  Sounds like you're in Iowa, and you have to take a covered wagon there.  I'm going to see the ocean.  Go to the ocean.  Go to the beach.  Which one were you thinking of?  Robert Moses.  Ah, yes.  Maybe check out some surfing.  Maybe do some boogie boarding myself. 
[00:11:00]  Watch out for the sharks, of course.  Don't want the sharks to get you.  Press has you all in a tizzy about the shark attacks.  Here's the deal.  The sharks you don't have to worry about.  Here's the deal.  Because the news is going to make a big deal of this.  I know we're off on a whole bunch of little topics here.  People are going to be eaten by sharks this summer.  It happens every fucking year.  Happens.  Sometimes they just take a nibble and decide, this is not what I eat, and they move on.  Other times, you get a psycho shark, decides they're going to just destroy you.  It's going to happen.  And some years, you get a few more. 
[00:11:30]  Some years, you get a few less.  The years where you get a few more, the press loves to call it like the summer of sharks.  Right.  Scare the pants off everybody.  And, of course, they've got to get that shot from the helicopter where they're like, look  how close these bathers were to sharks, and they had no fucking idea.  I know.  Very frightening.  Unbelievable.  But when you figure how many people actually go in the water.  Millions upon millions.  In the summer.  And how many are eaten by sharks.  Ah, it's kind of like that unlucky lottery.  Yeah, it is.  Unlucky lottery. 
[00:12:00]  If you're the little 14-year-old girl down there in Florida, was it?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that's a scary story.  She's out there on her boogie board.  Shark grabs her leg, ripped the meat right off her leg from her hip to her knee.  Like eating a chicken wing.  Like a chicken wing.  A little blue cheese on there.  Oh.  Just slide it right off.  Just slid right off the bone.  Took it right off.  Some surfer guy kind of grabbed her.  Old surfer dude.  Yeah, old surfer dude.  Supposedly was punching the shark in the nose. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, because the shark was following him in.  Because I guess she's bleeding all over the place.  Yeah.  And he's trying to get her in.  And the shark, you know, that's his dinner.  Yeah.  He had a little nibble of that and kind of liked it.  So he came back for more.  Well, fresh meat.  Yeah, it is, really.  They always talk about how the sharks like to take a bite out of us.  Realize it's not something they enjoy, so they move on.  Yeah.  But I'm thinking a young 14-year-old girl, the meat might taste a little better than old surfer dude.  Yeah, old surfer dude.  It's a little tough, a little gamey. 
[00:13:00]  A little gamey.  You got a nice tender girl, sure.  Shark's probably very into that.  So I didn't hear that.  So he's trying to get her in and the shark is following?  Following it right into the beach.  And he's punching it in the face, trying to keep it away.  Because that's what we learn on Shark Week.  Right.  You hit it in the nose.  A lot of sensory nerve endings in the shark's nose.  And it startles them when you punch them in the face.  Or gouge them in the eyes.  Or they rip your arm off and take your head and rip you to pieces.  I think it's pretty tough to punch anything underwater.  Well, I know for a fact.  Well, Frenchmen, a little difficult. 
[00:13:30]  I know for a fact that you don't do much damage when you're actually punching something underwater.  A little difficult.  But, man, that's just got to be one of the scariest situations to be in ever, ever, ever.  Is a shark attack.  Where maybe it got you a little bit.  And now you've got to make your way back.  And it's still around you.  Where you're conscious and injured.  Yeah.  Oh, that's just the most primal, primitive.  All of a sudden, you might as well just be caveman.  Because all the technology, everything else, all the knowledge on this planet is not going to help you one iota. 
[00:14:00]  When you're out there with a huge animal eating you, you are then just dinner.  You're nothing better than the seal or anything else he shoves down his gullet on a daily basis.  Right.  By the way, the girl was like 200 yards offshore.  Yeah, she was a little too far out.  Over a second sandbar that they talk about.  A lot of wildlife out there that you're not supposed to go out.  Oh, really?  Go out that far.  And she was out there.  So old surfer dude dragged her in. 
[00:14:30]  And mostly sharks.  She said she had stopped bleeding by the time he brought her in.  And so she had just totally drained.  See, it's the job of the news to scare everybody.  Making it sound like if you're stepping into the ocean this summer, you could get eaten by a shark.  But the reality is most of these sharks are down below you looking up.  And you look like a goddamn seal.  That's what it comes down to.  On the boogie board, you're kicking.  The other ones that get bit in the calf every once in a while and, you know, knee-deep water, they say, or waist-deep water.  That is so rare it's not even funny. 
[00:15:00]  Usually they're just looking for a meal.  They look up.  They see the surfer or the boogie boarder looking like a seal.  And they come up and then they attack.  Most shark attacks happen within 20 yards of the beach.  Well, where are all the people, idiot?  It's not like you're out there a mile off there swimming, you know.  There's crowds of people a mile off the beach.  I love their stats.  So anyway, after Friday's show, all set.  Ready to go to the ocean for the day. 
[00:15:30]  Go out to Long Island for the day.  I'm walking toward my car that I parked a few blocks from my abode.  I'm with Lindsey.  We're walking toward the car.  And all of a sudden I went, holy shit.  You've got to be fucking kidding me.  You saw it from a little distance off?  Yeah, I yelled.  They broke into my fucking car.  And by they, I know who you meant.  You know what?  I know for a fact that it was, yes.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, no.  Yes.  And the funny thing is, you know, people, I think people have figured out I'm probably 
[00:16:00]  the most liberal on this show.  Yes, you are.  And it makes it fucking hard to keep that open mind when shit like this happens to you.  It certainly does.  I'm sorry.  But you know what, dudes?  People like the person that broke into my car are ruining it for all of you.  Yep.  They're making horrendous examples.  You've got to move to the white suburbs, Opie.  I know for a fact.  Safe house.  I'm not going to tell you why I know, but I know for a fact.  And it's like, why?  I might as well be like Jimmy and Anthony. 
[00:16:30]  I might as well.  Hey.  Just hate them as a group.  No.  That is, you know something?  I will not stand here and take those accusations.  I'm going to get the tapes out.  All the examples of you guys hating them as a group.  I will not sit here and take that abuse.  So.  I'm just a realist as far as crime in the city goes.  So a few things.  I get up.  It's the passenger's front, you know, window.  They're completely destroyed. 
[00:17:00]  Busts your window.  Busts the window.  Now I'm wondering why the alarm didn't go off.  Does the alarm, like, stop going off after a while?  What kind of alarm do you have?  Do you have one of those, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Oh, I hate those.  Yeah, the famous alarm.  You have one of those?  Yeah.  You've heard it?  Yeah.  Ooh.  And when does it go off?  I would assume if you.  When you shake the car?  I'm assuming if you break the window in that it should go off.  And then I'm thinking.  You would think. 
[00:17:30]  Then I'm thinking maybe the cops came by because everyone was pissed off my alarm's going off for date.  Well, actually, it happened within a 24-hour period.  So for a day.  And maybe the cops just turned off the alarm from inside.  Ah.  Ah.  We don't know whose car this is, so we'll just move on.  But it's so, I mean, I don't have to, you know, so many people have been broken into this.  So I'm not saying anything that others don't know.  But it's just so violent.  It pisses you off.  You, like, you look around.  Like, you're going to see the guy standing right there. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Like, you look at your broken window, and you know it didn't just happen.  And you kind of look around like, where is the son of a bitch?  I'm going to kick his ass.  No, and he's just long gone with your goods.  So here's the funny thing.  They took my XM radio.  Yeah, your XM satellite radio.  They took my XM satellite radio.  What did you have, a Sky-Fi?  I had a Sky-Fi, and I got lazy with it.  Yeah.  Usually, you know, I'd take it out of the cradle or whatever, or cover it up. 
[00:18:30]  And I got lazy.  You left it in.  I got lazy.  It was sitting there.  And the funny thing is, I also had a serious unit in my car on the dashboard in plain sight  for well over a year.  I finally got that piece of junk out of my car.  Yeah.  And like I was talking about last week, it destroyed my dashboard.  Yeah, nice.  Because that was the only way they could mount the fucking thing.  With bolts.  And I was laughing because they had so many opportunities to take that serious satellite  radio.  It was in plain sight most of the time.  But I was thinking, to get the thing out of my car, they probably would have had to 
[00:19:00]  shatter my entire windshield.  Take out the windshield.  Take out the windshield to get the fucking thing out of my car.  But the tiny little Delphi, you know, the Sky-Fi, whatever the fuck they're called.  Yeah.  I remember they're called the Sky-Fi.  Yeah.  It was right there, plain sight.  And obviously some kind of crackhead.  Yeah.  Because they were in my car.  I like that Bob Edwards show.  Right.  I listen to the Bob Edwards every day.  That's a good show. 
[00:19:30]  Obviously, they were in my car for less than 10 seconds.  Yeah.  15 tops.  Any damage to the...  Oh, they tried to rip out the whole thing.  They did.  Yeah, they tried to rip out the whole thing.  So I thought they really did a number on my car because they saw wires all over the place.  Yeah, when you see wires, it's like...  I'm like, what do they do?  They take the factory-installed stereo?  What the fuck?  You know, because at first you don't know what the hell happened.  Then you're like, oh, they got the Sky-Fi, whatever, the XM satellite radio. 
[00:20:00]  I don't even know what it does.  I think this is some kind of radar unit.  Trying to sell it on the street.  You want to buy a radar unit?  I got this here.  This here, this here, a navigation system.  That's what I was thinking.  You know, they probably thought it was some kind of navigation system, I guess.  I don't know.  Then they took my change.  It's like, what?  Hey, cash.  It was like pennies and nickels and dimes because the quarters I used.  That's okay.  Because the quarters I used for the meter.  So it was like, it was chump change.  Tops. 
[00:20:30]  All he needs.  And then they took my charger for my phone.  My hands-free, you know, thing for my phone.  If society would help these people more, we wouldn't have these crimes.  Instead of just locking them up, I think these people need our help.  They need social programs to get them to end poverty and to end drug abuse.  And then we'll be in this utopian society where we can park our cars with the windows rolled open  and all our expensive equipment laid out on the dashboard because that will solve all of social's ills 
[00:21:00]  and never again will you be broken into.  Yeah, because there aren't just some people that just have given up  and decide they're just going to do drugs and commit crimes and that's their life.  Everyone can be saved, Opie.  Opie, I'm a little less liberal today.  Let's just put it that way.  Welcome.  A little less liberal.  Welcome to the dark side, Opie.  Welcome.  A little less liberal. 
[00:21:30]  And I don't want people to confuse me as a liberal.  That's ridiculous.  I just am a little more liberal than these guys.  A little more open-minded.  I'm more of a moderate, I believe.  Yeah.  But I lost a little of that liberalism this morning.  It is a little disheartening.  So they got the phone charger, the hands-free device for the cell phone,  my XM satellite radio change, and my get-out-of-jail-free sergeant's pin that Keith the cop gave us. 
[00:22:00]  What the hell are they going to do with that?  I have no idea.  I'm a member of the PBA.  Come on.  Yeah.  I mean, they're not going to sell any of this.  What are they going to get for half this stuff?  Cops come over there to rouse them, throw them against the wall.  Excuse me, officer.  I have this badge.  And then they went through my glove compartment.  They didn't take anything from there.  Then they took my map.  What the hell are they going to need a map for?  A map of every state in America? 
[00:22:30]  Because when I was on that hiatus there, I was driving around a lot.  So I needed a good map to get me from point A to point B.  How you gets to Wichita?  Let me look.  And then I happened to have some photos of when my niece came up from Florida.  And we took some pictures at the beach I wanted to go to, matter of fact, Anthony.  And they left that on there.  Oh, they left the picture?  They left that on the seat in the middle of all the glass.  So they kind of went through it?  Oh, boy, have a heart. 
[00:23:00]  Gee, thanks, you fucking animal.  I'm going to take the...  Look how nice this family scene is.  I never had no family.  Got all choked up.  Left the pictures.  So this is why I hate where I live, the Upper West Side, whichever.  But I'm taking this here lie detector, whatever it is.  I'm taking this here thing.  I think this finds uranium.  It's a Geiger counter or something.  Give me some crack for it.  We're going to go prospecting. 
[00:23:30]  He's sitting in an alley holding it with his feet trying to eat it.  Oh, it's not awful.  What is this about before I move on?  Go ahead, Mike.  Yeah, how you doing?  I remember when I own a car wash on Long Island, I've had a couple of them, and in one area,  in Westbury, we call it Westbury, but it's actually New Castle, and, you know, it's kind  of like an iffy area, and they used to steal the airbags out of the cars in the area, and 
[00:24:00]  we'd have to clean up all the broken glass of those cars.  And for a while there, they weren't just taking the airbags.  They were shitting on the passenger seats of the cars, and they'd come in with these  cars with the passenger seats all covered with shit, human shit.  Why?  Because they were bored, I guess.  They just made it more fun.  Who the fuck knows?  So they weren't just out taking shit to make money, but they were out just really fucking  with people in a bad way.  That's so weird. 
[00:24:30]  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  You got it.  Yeah, so this is why I hate the Upper West Side.  I can't wait to move back to the suburbs eventually.  The suburbs, Opie.  Because the people up there, they're just stuck-up snobs.  Yeah, and you're living in fear.  They think their shit don't stink.  They think they're the most important person in the world.  They're just awful, awful people up there.  They really are.  With bars on the windows.  With bars on the windows.  Unbelievable.  You know, the loneliest place in the entire city. 
[00:25:00]  I see the same people every day.  No one talks to anybody.  No one converses with anyone.  It's just awful.  So I'm there in front of my car.  I'm just discovering my car is broken into, which is a drag, obviously.  And there's glass everywhere.  And people are walking by over and over again, not even acknowledging what they're seeing in  front of them.  This huge, ridiculous scene.  You know?  Obviously, it's not that...  It's, you know...  It's not like blood all over.  No, I know.  It's not exactly September 11th.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not what I'm getting at. 
[00:25:30]  I know.  Let's put it in perspective.  It's just a stupid breaking in the car.  But you would think someone would acknowledge, just a slight acknowledgement, like, give you  that look like...  Like, oh, that sucks, dude.  That sucks.  That blows.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not asking for someone to go...  Oh, my God!  I'm not asking for...  Oh, my car got broken into...  You're kidding!  I'm not asking for someone to go run into their apartment and get a dustpan or something.  How did it happen?  The window was just there.  I was just looking at it. 
[00:26:00]  How did it...  Oh, no.  A shwuggy took your radio.  Oh, no.  Oh, God, love him.  No, I'm not looking for that.  I'm not looking for someone to come running, you know, running down the sidewalk with a  dustpan to help me out.  But just, like, an acknowledgement.  It's like, you fucking, like, assholes.  Like, at least acknowledge and give me a look like, ah, that's a drag.  This one guy to go, that sucks.  Something.  Yeah, walking by going, ah.  Because there's class everywhere, you know. 
[00:26:30]  Whatever.  And then all of a sudden, from above, behind me, like five stories up, I hear...  Is Kenny, Club Soda Kenny, playing that gag on you?  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Psst, psst, psst.  Cut me.  So I turn around, I look up, and there's a...  I think it was a lady.  I don't even know, because she never said a word.  Just from the psst, I'm thinking it's an older lady.  All of a sudden, she's holding out, like, a towel and, like, a rag out her window.  Yeah.  And I look up again, and she just throws it out the window. 
[00:27:00]  A rag.  To help you clean up?  Yeah, because obviously...  Oh, that was nice.  It was glass, and, you know, you could get cut pretty easily trying to clean up that mess.  It was nice.  But that's...  But not, like, not even a word.  Like, she was scared or something?  Yeah.  Like, maybe she saw the break-in?  Ooh.  Maybe she was enjoying a show on her new XM satellite radio.  It's funny.  She's probably the one that did it.  She just felt bad.  And by the way, I'm saying maybe she saw the break-in.  Hence, going back to the beginning of this conversation, knowing for a fact that it was a shwuggy. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Opie.  But that's all I'll say for now.  So...  That's a derogatory term.  How do you know?  So then I'm cleaning up the glass, and people just walking by, like, not even acknowledging  or noticing.  It's like, are you kidding me?  You're going to put it in a lot now?  Well, that's what Ben, you know...  Don't, don't, don't.  Of course, Ben's sitting here just laughing while you're telling the story.  I'm breaking it.  So then Ben's like, see, I told you so.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  He goes, you should park your car in a garage. 
[00:28:00]  First of all, my car's only in the city, like, part-time.  Second of all, let's see.  He said, I told you so.  I've had the place in New York for three years.  Do the math.  How much is a garage?  $400 a month, right?  Yeah.  So that would be about $5,000 a year, right?  I'd be $15,000 in the hole to park my car in the city for the last three years.  This break-in cost me $150.  So to say I told you so is ridiculous, is what I'm getting at.  You're just lucky he wasn't stolen.  But then again, you could drive down the village at night one night to go for dinner and have 
[00:28:30]  it happen there, too.  So even if you have a lot, it could still happen if you go somewhere else.  Right.  So I called Keith, the cop, and he hooked me up.  I got it to thank the people.  I don't have it in front of me.  I forgot the card, but I'll thank him tomorrow.  But this glass place on Deer Park Avenue, down there in North Babylon, I guess.  Hooked you up.  Oh, dude, in and out within a half hour.  Really?  I'm setting and rolling again.  But that was my Friday.  How do you know who the perp was?  I'm not.  Oh, perp.  I'm just saying.  I just know.  You're just saying, you know?  I just know.  Guy around the neighborhood. 
[00:29:00]  I just know.  I just know.  Bad element around the neighborhood, around the nice neighborhood?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a few.  There's a few that need their heads beat in.  Ooh.  Nice.  So that was my Friday after that show.  I'd say we'd get a gang together.  The Lords?  Go around.  Yeah, the Lords.  We'll call ourselves the Lords.  Jimmy, you mind?  That's fine.  Can we get the Lords out of retirement?  Yeah.  And I could yell, leave him alone!  Leave him alone!  And they start beating Jimmy up.  I'm going to throw a rock through a gas station window that I think the alarms will go off  and the police will be there immediately. 
[00:29:30]  Faggot white boy I am.  But the two observations before we move on, that Sirius Satellite Radio was sitting there  for the taking for over a year.  Yeah.  And like I said, I think they would have had to take out the whole windshield to get the  thing out of the car.  I don't know what that is.  Is that a refrigerator?  I thought it was an iron lung.  He didn't want you to die.  And then secondly, because I drove down to Philly to see Jet and Oasis, which was a cool  show.  So I was without my XM Satellite Radio for the weekend?  Uh-oh.  Dude, I don't know how people do it. 
[00:30:00]  I don't know how people are still listening to commercial radio.  How are the commercials?  I was out of my mind.  Yeah.  I'm thinking like a lot of these people are getting satellite radio in the cars for like  a three-month free trial or whatever.  Yeah, when you buy the car.  I can't even imagine these people saying no after three months.  I can't even imagine.  Because I was stuck going back to commercial radio this weekend.  And it was the first time in a really long time that I spent a lot of time listening  to commercial radio because I had to.  What a fucking nightmare. 
[00:30:30]  Yep.  It's the worst.  I was listening to YSP this weekend on my way down.  They do a good job, I got to admit.  But even them.  Even them.  Even them.  They had a ton of commercials.  The commercials.  You can't help it.  You can't get away from them.  It's unlistenable.  And the music is great.  And all that stuff is great.  But it's just.  We were goofing on that jack station.  So I'm like, I might as well listen to it.  See what they're all about.  I heard, like you said, I think last week.  I think I heard three songs.  Unless you come in right after a commercial break, you're only going to hear a couple 
[00:31:00]  of songs at most.  You know, it's one of those things where you come in after a commercial break and you might  hear, how many in a row, you think?  Three?  Four?  Like three.  Four.  But for the most part, you're popping in a couple of songs in already.  You hear two songs and then this huge long commercial break.  And I mean so long that you sit there and at first you're not even thinking about it.  And then you get mad at yourself.  What am I listening to?  Right.  You change the stage because it's just going on and on.  Dude, then I hit seek and just let the, you know, the dial just keep spinning around and 
[00:31:30]  around.  I didn't even care.  I would have listened to a disco song.  I never heard anything.  Anything.  You're just praying for anything different.  Yep.  And over and over again, it was the same shit.  Crap.  Commercials and songs you've heard a million fucking times.  Yeah.  I know we don't have to do a commercial for satellite radio.  The people listening to us are, you know, they've got the service.  But I can't even imagine that these people out there don't have satellite radio yet.  And then there's an article in the paper today about how commercial radio is finally going 
[00:32:00]  to start taking satellite radio and podcasting and the internet more seriously.  I think it's too late.  I don't think the...  Good luck.  I don't think they have the brains in commercial radio to figure out this one, man.  I just don't.  And they just can't run their stations commercial free.  And they're not going to cut back on the commercials because it cuts down on their bottom line.  So you're going to get a shitload of commercials that you've got to sit through.  People don't have to do that anymore.  I was out of my mind trying to find one lousy station I could listen to for more than 10 or 15 minutes. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  I had enough of Jack, too.  Hey, guys, they're playing a bunch of different...  That's what they should have been doing 20 years ago.  Yeah.  Stop trying to make up for it now.  No, because of iPods and because of satellites.  Stop trying to...  It's too late.  That's what they think.  Look at the diversity you get here.  Well, here's the problem.  They're not even doing it right.  They're making believe they're giving you a lot of variety.  But what it is is just another playlist.  Of course.  The playlist is just a little different than the other playlist that the average listener is used to.  That's all that format is. 
[00:33:00]  I mean, if you really paid attention to Jack in New York here and listened all day and wrote all the songs down,  you'd realize there's not as much variety as you thought.  It's just a lot of songs that kind of have fallen through the cracks, so to speak.  Songs that are kind of cool that radio forgot about, so now they made it into this format.  That's all that is.  And there's a station town in Philly called Ben.  Ben.  That's just like Jack.  Did you listen to Ben?  I listened to Ben for a while.  And it was just like Jack in New York.  It was the same fucking songs.  Yeah.  So now those songs will be played to death. 
[00:33:30]  Jack and Ben.  Oh, they have, I don't know, there's a Bill, there's a Todd.  It's just first, you know, that's the thing they're doing now.  Just grab a guy's first name.  It's just radio is filled with cornballs.  Yeah.  They're just cornballs.  Mm-hmm.  Trying to have some clever little hook to them.  Hey, do you want to listen to Jack later if they're worried?  Yeah, sure.  Come on over.  Let's listen to Jack.  No one's talking about it.  Jack.  So, that was my Friday, which was a drag.  Oh, keep the cops on the line.  Ooh.  Hey, Keith, what's up? 
[00:34:00]  Hey, what's going on?  What's the name of that glass place?  Those guys were huge.  Real quick, first of all, what the fuck is with the on-hold music?  It was like the 40s channel or something.  Really?  Is that our hold music?  I have absolutely.  Maybe on the hotline?  I think it might have been Frank's place or something like that, but I was like,  what the hell is that shit?  I couldn't listen to the show at all.  I had no idea what was going on.  Okay.  We got to fix that.  Yeah, maybe there was...  Yeah, why wouldn't the show be on hold?  Yeah, we'd like to know why. 
[00:34:30]  All right, we'll find out.  Hawk!  What's up, Keith?  Yeah, real quick, the first thing, yeah, it was an All Island glass.  All Island glass on Deer Park Avenue.  Deer Park Avenue, yeah.  They were very nice.  They hooked you up real quick.  I'm going to send a package down on those guys, but if you're driving by and you, I don't  know, own a donut shop or something.  Yeah, if some shwoogie broke your window, feel free to stop in at All Island glass.  All Island glass.  You just, I don't know.  Keith, drop some stuff off to those guys if you're in the area.  Keith, where are they located?  Because I actually, my windshield got cracked on the road this weekend. 
[00:35:00]  Oh.  They're at 1870 Deer Park Avenue.  Is that Manhattan?  No, no.  Long Island.  Long Island, because I was heading out that way, so Keith found a place for me.  They were awesome, and they were fans of the show and stuff, so I want to thank those  guys.  Hey, Keith, do you laugh at people that call the cops for, like, this kind of thing?  Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much useless, and I told them the same thing.  It's like, you know, it's a crime opportunity, and it's crackheads, you know?  What are they going to do?  They're feeling a change?  Yeah, they don't know. 
[00:35:30]  Like you said, they probably thought it was a navigation or something, because they don't  know it's got to be activated.  It's a fucking waste.  Yeah, did you cancel your subscription on there?  Of course.  Of course I did.  Don't let them get any of that free XM.  You know, it's totally useless.  But you know what?  Like you said, you want to have faith in society, and you want to, you know, believe that everything's  getting better.  But let me give a couple small examples.  All right.  And this is, in fact, I showed one a couple months ago, but I have a new one, too.  And I'm going to read them.  And these are confessions of young African-American boys committing crimes in the city. 
[00:36:00]  First one, he is 16 years old.  I was on my way home, and a man came by ranting, R-A-N-I-N-G, by me, and he doped a furs,  and I paid it up, and the cop stopped me, and I told, T-O-A-D, the cop, wait, happened,  and the man had on blue jerse and long hair and a red shirt, S-H-R-T. 
[00:36:30]  I'm a goop kid.  I foot, nof, po, that to a woman.  That is an actual confession written out by, oh, my God.  And that was actually Mayor Sharp James of Newark.  Right.  So there is one, and that is approximately a year and a half ago.  Wow.  Now, this one is from two days ago.  All right.  So here is things not getting better. 
[00:37:00]  My name, Devin.  Me and my Bryneds, F-R-I-N-E-D-S, had went to Sports Depot to pay some football scuffs, F-C-U-F-F.  On the way back, and I assume this is Alex, A-E-L-X.  Yeah.  Alex, Terry, named some boys and tried to had some them, 
[00:37:30]  and Axe and Terry told them to ran their pockets, P-O-X-E-T-T-S.  Were they robbing them?  Yes.  Okay.  I can't even figure out what the hell they're doing.  Hey, Keith, is this guy Jamaican?  No.  Oh.  No.  So there is two fine examples of how the school system is working very well in the city.  I guess so.  Wow.  About the school system.  More money to education will help that. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Education is going well, and parenting, they're doing a fine job of parenting.  You know what I think we should invest in in this city?  Bricks and bars.  That's it.  Bricks and steel bars.  Well, that's pretty much it.  More prisons.  All right, Keith, a week from Wednesday is the big WOW Summit, right?  Ooh.  The second annual, well, it's not annual, the second Keep the Cop WOW Summit.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  July 13th, we're going down the club risk game in Philadelphia,  and I've got to tell you, since I announced it on Friday,  I've got an overwhelming response in my email.  I've got a guy coming from Florida.  He's bringing his chick with him.  He's going to ride all the way up.  And then I've got some old trucker fella.  I'm sorry I forget his name, but he's going to bring his bike to Pennsylvania,  park it someplace.  He's going to ride to New York from a truck stop.  I told him he's going to bring a lot lizard with him from Pennsylvania someplace, 
[00:39:00]  and then he's going to ride back to Philly with us.  All right, so basically a week from Wednesday,  you want people to show up at the station here in New York City?  Yeah, if you go to opianthony.com or you're one of the two message boards,  whackbag or .net, both of those have instructions on them.  We're going to meet up 6.30 in the morning at the station.  7 o'clock, we'll do a quick intro of the girls and stuff like that to show up.  And then by 7.30, we're going to be on the road heading down to Club Britskay.  That's cool.  We got ourselves a convoy. 
[00:39:30]  Down to Club Britskay.  Do they do convoys anymore?  Convoy.  You never know with all these truckers that we got, they might hook up.  I was thinking about your summit, Keith.  You're going to have to go back to work eventually,  but you're going to do this one-day trip from New York to Philly, obviously,  and then you guys are going to hang out at Club Britskay and have a good time,  and there will be wow all over the highway,  and people driving by will get to see all sorts of boobs and stuff, obviously.  I'm thinking that that could be the first leg of this thing.  Then someone maybe in Philly could take it upon themselves 
[00:40:00]  to organize the next stop.  And then we advertise it on the show, and then we continue this thing.  And it just goes and keeps going.  It just keeps going and takes on a life of its own, is what I'm thinking.  I'm on vacation that week.  I keep going.  So maybe you keep going.  We'll see how it develops.  But the first leg will be New York to Philly a week from Wednesday, right?  Absolutely.  Just show up at the station at 6.30 if you want to go for the ride.  Right.  Club Britskay is going to do a breakfast, lunch sort of thing  when we get down there at about 10 a.m. 
[00:40:30]  So I think Philly cheesesteaks is something.  Okay.  And working on some promotional stuff and everything.  So it should be a good time.  Looking forward to it.  All right.  And if someone wants to try to organize Philly to somewhere else,  let's start thinking about that.  Absolutely.  Sounds good.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  All right.  Have a good day, man.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  This guy from Boston has something.  Pat, what's up?  Yeah, I know why they stole the map.  Pat?  And they stole the map because it basically gives credibility  when asking all tussled with which way north. 
[00:41:00]  Wow, dude.  You blew it.  Wow.  Wow.  That was just...  When you have to say basic and credibility in the setup,  your joke is not going to work.  He can't punch out.  He crashed.  I know.  I'm punching out after the cred.  Pulled up.  It was perfect as it was written on the screen.  Yeah.  They never do it like that.  Stole the map so they know which way is north.  Easy.  There it is.  Simple.  Car trunk danger.  Uh-oh.  We'll get into that story next. 
[00:41:30]  Ouch.  That's absolutely a horrible story,  but now look at the news just all taking advantage of it.  Of course.  Fucking...  How to protect your child.  Teach kids not to play in cars.  Keep car locked.  Hide keys from kids.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, God.  I hate the news.  What, uh...  How about this?  Keep your retards away from the trunks.  That's what happened.  I know.  One kid was a little off.  A little.  A little off, I guess.  He dragged his two dumber friends in with him.  I know.  How do you not know enough to get in a trunk?  And shut the lid.  Yeah, well, get in here and shut the lid. 
[00:42:00]  What should they possibly have been playing that you would do that?  Well, you know, who knows?  Monster.  Oh, monster trunk.  Do it yourself, safety latch.  Oh, look.  Now she has to get into the car trunk.  Oh, please suffocate.  She has to get into the trunk.  Please let a drunk driver just barrel into that car right now while she's inside of it.  Just rear ends it, collapses the trunk.  Now she's in the trunk showing how you could open it from the inside if you had one of these  specially made safety locks.  They should be in every trunk.  What's the problem? 
[00:42:30]  We've been doing this for 30 years.  It costs a couple of bucks more, I guess, for the car company, so they don't want to do it.  Why don't they just put it in there?  They don't want to do it.  And look, she's out of the trunk.  All safe and sound.  Ah, look at that.  People across the street looking at this in-depth news report.  Why don't you get in the water and demonstrate how the shark attacked the person?  Drag some ketchup behind your leg.  Easy story, whore.  Where the hell is our troops?  Where are our troops behind her?  That's a perfect opportunity.  Yeah, we haven't had many assaults on the media lately.  Are people pussying out? 
[00:43:00]  I think they are pussying out on us.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  Then we've got to see how Jim Norton's weekend was.  Yes.  He's down in Philly for Babe Fest, and then he did a show down there in Virginia.  Washington.  Was it?  Yeah, actually.  It was actually a fair...  It was actually a false church, Virginia, about 10 miles outside D.C.  And look, the phones have gone crazy.  Jim killed in Virginia.  Jim rocked on Friday.  Oh, thank you.  We'll get into that and some other things in just a bit.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Obi and Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with O&A.  Hey, ass pop.  Hi.  This is great.  You dick.  I'm not alone.  Bye, I, I.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm. 
[00:44:00]  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Listen to Opie and Anthony every morning live from 7 to 11 a.m.  And just in case you miss the show, there are replays all day long.  Keep listening, stupid.  On the West Coast, catch the Opie and Anthony Show replays throughout the day at 8 a.m.,  noon, 4 p.m., and now at 9 p.m.  So stop crying, little girl, and put down those razor blades. 
[00:44:30]  Because you've got O&A all day.  Another message from the friendly staff at the Opie and Anthony radio program.  Search it.  Seek and destroy.  Search it.  Seek and destroy.  Search it.  Seek and destroy. 
[00:45:00]  Lube.  That's lube?  Yeah.  How'd it get here?  Why do you have a thing of lube in front of you?  I don't know.  It was sitting here when I came in.  It's wet.  Original gel lubricant.  The worst.  Is it really bad?  Awful.  Formulated and tested according to the Heisman industry standard.  Water-based.  Gentle.  Odorless.  Colorless.  Greaseless.  You don't like wet?  No, I certainly don't.  What's wrong with it?  It's awful.  It gets rubbery and smells chemical-like. 
[00:45:30]  When you're whacking your bag, Eros is the best stuff.  E-R-O-S.  That might feel good for a second, but then it has just an awful...  It's like Astro Glide.  It's also terrible.  It's got an awful texture to it.  Yeah.  How about I don't even know how to open it.  Let me see this thing, please.  Uh-oh.  It's going to be all over the place.  Why?  I don't know.  No, I...  You threw it away.  I wanted to feel if it was slippery.  The answer is who cares.  I'd like to know. 
[00:46:00]  Well, Jimmy...  Sure.  We have to get into the Jimmy thing.  Jimmy had a huge weekend.  Yeah.  A couple good stories coming out of your weekend, huh?  Should we start with Friday, I guess?  Yeah, I think we have to.  Well, there was two great stories.  Friday was Babe Fest down there at WYSP.  Babe Fest.  The old home of...  One of the homes of the O.P. and Anthony program.  It was like our second home, Philly, I believe.  And even Tim Sabian told me he so wished that we were still part of that radio station.  They've been great.  Even since we got booted off, I mean, they've always been supportive of me and the show. 
[00:46:30]  He runs a great radio station, I've got to tell you.  Yeah, he's great.  You could just hear it.  You just could hear it when you're tuning in WYSP.  Obviously, the commercial thing stinks.  That's not his fault, though.  No, obviously.  And Tim Sabian's been yelling and screaming at the company,  you've got to get O.P. and Anthony, you know, as part of this thing again.  But they're not listening.  So they would rather just, you know, die a slow death as satellite radio takes over the world.  That's fine.  Whatever.  But Tim Sabian's trying to do his part.  Anyway, so he invited you to be one of the judges at Babe Fest? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, I hosted it last year.  It was me and Cousin Ed, who's the afternoon guy.  And this year, I was a judge with Florentine and some guy...  Jesus, Hawk, you all right?  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  That's fine.  What was that?  Some sneeze attack.  All right.  All right.  You look good in your baby blue shirt.  Thank you.  Periwinkle.  That's nice.  So I'm co-hosting...  I mean, I'm being a judge this year with Florentine,  and this guy, Bam, from MTV, who I had no idea who he was, and some...  You don't know Bam from MTV? 
[00:47:30]  No idea.  Jesus Christ.  No idea.  He was on Jackass, and then he's got his own show where...  Diva La Bam?  Yeah, no, no.  I heard afterwards.  I heard.  His friends and family.  I wouldn't have known him if he wound up in a buddy booth next to me.  Really?  Never heard of him.  Coincidentally enough.  He's kind of big.  There he was.  He's kind of big with the kids, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  I'm sure he's very popular.  That's one of the biggies out there, as far as the MTV culture goes.  Yeah.  I had no idea.  No?  So he was a judge, and Jesus...  You really had no idea?  That amazes me.  Did you ever see Jackass?  Yeah, just the movie once. 
[00:48:00]  I never watched the show.  No?  He was one of the guys in the movie.  Oh.  Who knows him?  All right.  I don't know.  I'm a pop culture ass.  You really are.  I don't know.  And Gene Simmons was the host with Cousin Ed, and...  Right.  I had my little awkward...  Gene.  ...run in in January with Gene.  Yeah, there was a problem with Gene.  Of course, our listeners know, because they've heard the replay a few times of you just ripping  Gene apart.  Yeah, we get it.  I was a lifelong Kiss fan from childhood. 
[00:48:30]  Uh-huh.  And we interviewed him one day on the phone.  I had met him a couple times, once with you guys years ago, and once with the rest of  Kiss in the garden.  And he, you know, we interviewed him one day, and I see him in Vegas a week later, and I  go, hey, I'm from the Opie and Anthony show, and Steve is with me.  And he was pretty rude.  He was very rude.  And, um...  You wanted a picture?  I said, yeah, can I get a quick picture?  He's like, oh, no, I can't take a picture, and I'm walking.  And he kind of turned me down.  He goes, you can walk with me.  So I go to walk with him, and Yoshi's backing up at the camera trying to take a picture. 
[00:49:00]  And Gene wouldn't even look at me.  I'm like, can we just take the picture real quick?  And he's got a camera crew with him, and he wouldn't even acknowledge that there was a  human being speaking to him.  What a cock.  And the guy shouldn't have been given the time of day by you after that.  I was, yeah, and I was just furious.  So I kind of went off on the air about it.  Kind of.  Yeah, I was a little upset.  A little.  A day and a half or two days removed.  Yeah.  So in Philly, he's hosting this event.  So I'm backstage.  He has no idea why.  He doesn't remember me.  Of course, I bring the two pictures I have with him to get signed. 
[00:49:30]  I'm like, you know, I'll let bygones be bygones.  And he's actually very cool backstage.  We're talking.  He's very nice.  He signs the pictures.  He's friendly.  He's talking to everybody backstage.  He got me so good, too.  I'm walking away.  He goes, Jim?  Jim?  And I turn around.  He goes, not you.  No.  Somebody asked him to do that, and he did.  He got me really good.  Oh.  So.  Wow.  He was very cordial and, you know, very accommodating.  We talked about the Middle East a little bit and just chit-chatted because he had made 
[00:50:00]  those comments about Islam being an awful culture or whatever it was he said.  So they call us out on the stage.  They introduce me.  They introduce Florentine.  Bam.  And then Gene, the master of ceremonies, comes out.  And the way BabeFest is, it's a bikini contest, basically.  The host is in the middle of this massive stage, 3,000 people at the Electric Factory  in Philly.  And we're on these couches on the stage on the side, and we're going to judge the girls.  So Gene is filming a reality TV show.  Got a camera guy with him.  It says, Gene's TV.  If you don't want to be on TV, you'd have to sign a waiver saying it's okay to be on TV. 
[00:50:30]  So he comes out, and he goes, he says hello.  And he goes, if anyone doesn't want to be on my show, you know, come up on the stage now.  So all of a sudden, he starts pointing to the middle of the room, and he goes, oh, you,  do you want to come up on stage?  And I look, and there's this maniac in a red hat running towards the stage, and Gene's  like, well, come on up here.  So the kid's trying to jump up on the stage, and you hear, poof.  He breaks the stage light.  It's like one of those fluorescent stage lights.  He breaks it.  It's like a long runway. 
[00:51:00]  It's the runway that Patty got the stuff right on.  The urine.  So this maniac runs around the runway to the other part of the stage to get on.  And I'm like, Jesus Christ, this guy's a fanatic.  Yeah.  He jumps up on the stage, and Gene walks over to him with a microphone, and then this kid  starts walking towards me and pointing at me.  Uh-oh.  And I'm going, oh, no.  Oh, it's a pest.  Oh, no, a pest.  Oh, out of all those people.  In front of 3,000 people, Gene goes, yes, what do you want? 
[00:51:30]  And the guy goes, my friend Lil Jimmy Norton likes to take celebrity pictures.  Why wouldn't you take a celebrity picture with him?  And I'm going, it's okay.  It's okay.  He was nice to meet backstage.  My friend Lil Jimmy Norton.  Dude, it was okay.  And Gene's like, oh, Gene realized, I guess, that something had happened.  So Gene grabs me by the hand, and he holds my hand and walks me to the stage.  Oh, my hand, man.  It was all trying.  Oh, my hand, man. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, it hurt my ego.  He walks me to the middle of the stage, holding my hand.  Little Jimmy Robinson would have been out of his mind with happiness.  Yes, that's exactly what, he had kicked you.  You know something, figuratively speaking, this was your dream.  Yes.  He had kicked you down the stairs by not taking your picture in Vegas.  And being rude and nasty and treating you like that.  He hurt you.  Yes.  Because you've been such a big fan.  And I was hurt.  And now was the time for him to cuddle you and make you feel better. 
[00:52:30]  Make it all better.  And pat your head.  Well, it would have been nice if he had no idea what was going on.  And Cousin Ed is panicking because he seems like this is a problem.  This guy is not a fun fan.  This guy is like, why wouldn't you take a celebrity picture?  You know, there's just maniacs accusing Gene Simmons.  So Gene walks me out to another stage and he knows something's wrong.  And he says to me, what happened?  I'm like, well, you know, you blew me off in Vegas. 
[00:53:00]  But it was okay.  You know, because he was being loud.  But it was okay.  I was saying to the guy, like, dude, it's okay.  He was nice backstage.  Everything's okay.  And Gene goes, what would you like me to do?  I'm like, yeah, we can take a picture.  Gene goes, okay, fine.  Who's going to take it?  And so we look at this one guy in the middle of the floor who's actually working for YSP.  And we go to take the picture and Gene puts his arm around me and he puts his leg up.  And I hug him.  I see the picture right here.  Can we get that picture up on opiananthony.com?  We'll do that soon.  And, oh, yeah, you see the silly little picture.  You're hugging him. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he put his leg up as a goof.  So I hugged him and the guys took the picture.  And then Gene goes, okay.  And then the kid who's sitting now in my seat on the couch just starts going to Gene.  And now I want an apology.  Why you wouldn't walk with Jimmy when you said you would walk with him?  A little son of a bitch wants an apology.  I'm like, dude, it's okay.  Everything's fine.  The guy's representing you.  Dude, Club Soda Kenny has to come and get him off the stage.  It was nice.  And Kenny isn't very...  Well, Kenny just kind of shoved him off.  Because Cousin Head is having a stroke right now.  The kid's yelling, oh, and a party rock. 
[00:54:00]  And the kid pulls him off.  And Kenny pulls him off the stage.  Fucking bad.  He's just a lunatic.  And then we go to like a break after the band plays.  They had a song to do after the first round.  So Gene walks up to me and he goes, why would he think I'd ever mistreated you?  I'm like, well, you know...  Oh, I might have said something.  One time in Vegas, you know, you were really busy.  And I'm such a worm.  You are a worm.  Well, again, you kind of blew me off for a picture.  And I mentioned it on the air. 
[00:54:30]  Just casually mentioned it on the air.  And he was a fan.  And the fans are very protective.  And they're very fierce fans, you know.  And Gene's like, well, he was a little crazy.  But Gene doesn't understand fierce fans.  Well, he gets it.  Because he goes, what happened?  I saw he was going to be a problem.  And I had to nip it right in the bud.  Something like that spreads like wildfire.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  Exactly.  He goes, well, when I mentioned that, you know,  if anyone doesn't want to be on TV,  you have to come up on the stage.  This kid's in the middle of the room looking at me and yelling, 
[00:55:00]  fuck you, Gene, fuck you.  This maniac had been just...  That's why Gene brought him on.  Because this lunatic was yelling, fuck you,  and jamming his middle finger up at Gene Simmons.  So this kid...  He wanted to stop it right there.  Oh, he knew this kid was a problem.  Yeah.  This kid embarrassed Gene Simmons from Kiss,  a rock icon in front of 3,000 people.  What an ass.  For a fat-titted sidekick from Jersey.  So closer to Kenny, I sent Kenny out to him.  I'm like, make sure I didn't throw him out. 
[00:55:30]  And I said, like, thank him for me.  And, you know, just ask him.  Everything's cool.  Don't do anything else.  I don't want to get the kid in trouble.  Yeah.  And we got his information.  I'm going to send him some stuff.  Because I really did love the little bastard for doing it.  I mean, it was really...  That's hilarious.  Really moving that he did it.  You know, he defended me like that.  Certainly did.  It was so funny because Gene had been really nice  to the backstage tonight,  so he had no idea why he was being sandbagged by this...  He called you Little Jimmy Norton on stage?  Oh, yeah.  He's like, you know, Little Jimmy Norton likes to take...  Little Jimmy.  As soon as he walks over, and I'm sitting there... 
[00:56:00]  Because someone had told me you should come into YSP  because Gene was going to be in that day.  But I couldn't because I knew if I did,  somebody would call up and go,  why don't you ask Gene why he wouldn't take a picture with you?  Yeah.  So I'm like, I don't need that.  You want to avoid the whole thing.  Yeah, because I want to get the picture signed.  Meanwhile, it becomes a huge event.  No, I'm like, in front of the whole theater.  It was packed.  YSP event.  Yeah, it wasn't an Opium Anthony event.  No.  No, no, this was for YSP.  And they were just...  Yeah, poor Cousin Ed.  That's some great pictures from BabeFest.  The chicks were phenomenal.  Just fantastic.  We should just send them over to YSP today, I guess. 
[00:56:30]  What's the website?  94WYSP.com if you want to see pictures from BabeFest  that Jimmy was a part of.  And anyone that has pictures of me and Gene Simmons,  especially that blog, I would love to send me a large file  because I would love to blog it up and hang it on my wall.  That's a great shot.  Of course you would.  And there's video of that, too,  so hopefully we'll be able to get some video loaded up to the foundry.  Speaking of video, do we have video of the chicks  spitting in your mouth from Friday?  I don't know.  Steve might be taking this.  Is that up on OpiumAnthony.com?  We got some good video and pictures from Friday's show. 
[00:57:00]  I hate that Steve can't put hardcore up there anymore.  Yeah, what's up with that?  I just hate it.  Unless the Republicans and their fucking family nonsense.  The fucking internet, for God's sake.  Let's just put on there whatever you want.  You go there, you look.  You could put the most graphic, violent, dead images  of mangled, mutilated people on a website.  And it will not be a problem.  No one talks about that and how the children might be affected. 
[00:57:30]  As a child, that would fuck me up for a long time  seeing some of the stuff that's available  as far as violence, death, and destruction goes.  Sex, that would just be beautiful.  And for some reason, they're so up in arms about keeping that off.  What's wrong with seeing a girl with a strap on dildo  fucking another girl on a couch  on the wonderful Liberator from Friday?  Okay, but you can't show that. 
[00:58:00]  But if you want to see someone that jumped off a ten-story building  and it's a street pizza, that's fine.  No one's even complaining about it.  Any child can see it.  It could be on the computer.  No problem.  We're just...  We're idiots.  We're just uptight assholes in this country.  These conservative jerk-offs are just as religious right...  What's the problem with a few tits and a bush?  It's on everybody.  If they're mangled and fucking cut off with knives  and laying in the street, then you can show them. 
[00:58:30]  Unbelievable.  Well, now they took the drapings off  because stupid Ashcroft is out  and he was just awful at this kind of stuff.  Ashcroft actually had the statues behind him  where he gives his speeches  draped over with sheets  so you could not see the bosoms,  the bare bosoms of the statues.  And it wasn't pornographic.  These were art, man.  These were old sculpture, beautiful statues.  Like, you fucking ass.  Is that what you're worried about?  That's what we have to worry about in this country?  Some tits on a statue?  That's what we're worried about.  Unbelievable.  So anyone that tells me I don't attack the right... 
[00:59:00]  I mean, look, this is the part of the right  that makes me one of...  They are just repugnant.  They're worse for free speech  than anybody on the left has ever been.  All just uptight, repressed jackasses.  Awful.  That in private,  they all just want to bang  their fucking 20-year-old interns  that are all around them.  And in public,  they're so pompous  and self-important.  What's...  I mean, Steve's got great video  of that girl getting tooled  with a strap-on dildo.  Who doesn't want to see that? 
[00:59:30]  Nobody doesn't want to see that!  Thank you.  I answered my own question.  Well, Steve probably could put it up there.  He says no.  What's the problem?  Because there's too much shit.  It's too available.  He would have to make the site  some kind of pay site  with all kinds of passwords and stuff.  In order to keep it free and open,  you've got to restrict the shit out of it.  Time to put out a DVD.  Yeah.  The official Open Anthony DVD  coming soon.  How about that?  To your max gone wild.  Shock jocks gone wild. 
[01:00:00]  Well, we love to put it up there  but we just can't because of the...  All right, all right, all right.  All right, Steve.  Relax, Jesus.  Your shirtless body, Jimmy,  in this picture,  looks like...  I swear to you, I'm sorry.  It looks like a chubby 13-year-old girl.  Doesn't it?  Yeah, it does.  It looks like a little girl body.  A fat little girl.  It looks like the nubs are just about to...  Just little titties are growing in.  You're awful.  You know something?  Out of everything,  I want that taken off the site  because that's offensive. 
[01:00:30]  I know.  I shouldn't have to look at a child's tits like that.  It's kind of a religious right.  It should be the religious wrong.  Oh, Liddy.  You're incorrigible.  Should we Photoshop that picture?  Or what?  Does it need any Photoshop?  What, and put a young girl's face on it?  That's what I'm thinking.  You'd probably be considered child pornography.  No, it's funny.  They did say that that was not considered child porn.  Yeah, you could actually put a kid face on it.  It's all body.  I got the clip from Family Guy.  That's why I was going down this road.  Because Jimmy got spit in my mouth. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, Friday, the girl's mouth.  And I actually lost what you should have seen.  If that would have been taken six months ago,  you should have seen what an atrocious sight that would have been.  We'd have been like a 40-year-old chick.  You're just, you know what it is.  It's not so much the shape your body's in.  It's the complete hairlessness of it.  What's wrong with a man having you?  Dude, there's not even a hint of hair on your chest.  You're like a dolphin.  And we know you don't shave.  There is not a peach fuzz nothing on you.  It's scary, man.  I don't know what happened.  I'm just too shy to grow hair.  Too shy?  That is amazing. 
[01:01:30]  It really is.  Burn victims have more hair on their bodies.  Well, that picture's up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  My chest really does have the hair of a fetus mouth.  It really is.  Gross little.  That chest should be in a trunk somewhere.  All right.  Here's the clip from Family Guy last night.  So why would you be a good candidate on The Bachelorette?  I would be perfect for your show because I know how to talk dirty to the ladies. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  That feels so good.  Spit in my mouth.  Quickie.  Yeah.  And I do have to, at one point, clear up what happened in D.C. because I got hate mail.  No, let's do it now.  All right.  Let's do it now.  So the Friday was Babe Fest.  We had a very busy weekend.  Quickly, I just want to go back to the spitting thing.  A question was brought up to me over the weekend, and I pondered it and wondered what happened. 
[01:02:30]  Who cleaned her spit off the window, if anybody?  Did one of the interns clean it off?  Obviously, it's cleaned up.  Well, I see some still dripped down.  Look.  Oh, yeah.  I see that, too.  Okay.  Because I'm wondering who got spittle cleanup detail.  Hell, that is a rank fucking job, man.  These interns, the things they have to do.  You want to be an intern?  You clean it up.  You clean it up.  I took it in my mouth.  They could at least wipe it down with Windex. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, but that really repulsed me.  Did it?  Not so much her spitting in your mouth.  I thought that was...  She had great breath, it was like fresh minty breath, it was good gum breath.  But her spitting on the window was disgusting me.  Like, in your mouth is funny, I don't care.  Yeah.  But on the window, and then she's rubbing it around with her fingers and licking the spit  on the window, and it was a lot of it.  That's gross, because the window's dirty.  Yeah, well...  See, the window...  Spit's fine.  It's like, you kiss girls, right?  Yeah, but there's something about spit, like, there's spit in your mouth all the time.  Right. 
[01:03:30]  But you wouldn't spit it into a glass and then drink it.  See?  But it's in your mouth.  The difference is, um, spitting your own spit into a glass, you're right, I wouldn't  do that, but if, uh, I've seen footage of people who, like, will spit into a glass and  somebody else drinks it.  Yeah, it's...  Yeah.  You ever see the Brazilian footage of people blowing snot into a bowl and then people drink  it?  I can't even figure...  Vomit and shit and snot people drink.  Yeah, it's true.  There's footage of that, though, of someone drinking a bowl with snot and vomit in it.  It's just vial on every level. 
[01:04:00]  Alright, here's the deal.  Yeah.  We're going to take another break.  And I'm getting already turned on.  No, and then we'll see what, uh, happened in, uh, Virginia.  Virginie.  Who's Virginia?  What happened in her?  Oh, stop it, Liddy.  Here's the problem, and we're trying to figure out a solution.  I love my MiFi, right?  Yeah.  And people are taping the show now.  No, they're just taping and they're listening when they feel like listening.  It's the whole on-demand thing that's taking over the world, right?  Mm-hmm.  But the problem is, on the MiFi, if we don't take a break, there's like an hour of content. 
[01:04:30]  Very hard to fast forward.  You can't fast forward with the MiFi.  Yeah.  So the solution is to try to take, you know, some more breaks for these guys so they can,  so they could, uh, manage, you know, the show a little better.  Are you saying we'll be taking breaks to appease the MiFi audience?  It's kind of, I gotta be honest, it's kind of frustrating.  Yeah.  You know, because I want to take a listen here and there, and there's an hour segment,  like, you know what, I, ugh.  I don't want to listen to the whole hour.  You gotta work on that, where you can just buzz through it. 
[01:05:00]  But I wonder if there's something we could do while we're just doing the show, where  we just do a quick, like, 15 seconds or something and it breaks it up.  I don't know.  Hmm.  And you know they will fix that.  At least you don't have to download 45 minutes and listen to it like a tape recorder.  Well, here's the problem.  But stupid, serious.  But here's the problem with the MiFi.  Let's say we have an hour of content and you're listening, you're listening, the phone rings,  whatever, you forget to push pause or what have you.  You have to start that file over again.  Yeah.  That's a drag.  But if it was broken up into 15, 20-minute segments somehow, then it would be very, much  more manageable for the listeners. 
[01:05:30]  Like, if you're 48 minutes in and you want to hear something you just missed, you have  to go back to the beginning.  You can't listen to that.  And it gets broken up by commercial breaks that we take.  It gets broken up when we go into that studio.  Whenever we go to that studio.  Oh, okay.  So I'm just trying to figure, think if there's a way to do it where it doesn't disrupt the  show but helps the listeners out there.  Hmm.  You know?  I mean, we can figure that out.  Because then when you have it all taped, then you go to, you can see, it'll say,  Opie and Anthony, and it'll say 65 minutes, let's say.  Yeah.  And then it'll show, like, commercial for NASCAR, show a commercial for home plate, what 
[01:06:00]  have you.  Yeah.  You know?  So you don't have to listen to that stuff.  And you go right back into the show.  Gotcha.  You know what I mean?  But our segments would be, like, 65 minutes, and then 52 minutes, and then maybe we did  a quick 15-minute break.  15 minutes of Opie and Anthony.  And then the promos are listed.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah, like every 20 minutes or so.  So then you spin your wheel, and you don't have to listen to the promos anymore.  It should be something automated that every 20 minutes, it just for a split second goes  dun-dun-dun.  That's what I'm wondering.  Make a little jump.  That's what I'm wondering.  There's got to be something we could do to help out everybody. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, this whole thing is going that way.  Yeah.  Where people are just going to record this and listen whenever they want.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll find out how the Virginia show was for Jimmy, and we'll get into other things as  well.  Ramon, wipe the spittle off the window.  Yuck.  Ramon, make this a pay site.  Also on the show today, Tom Cruise and Matt Lauer. 
[01:07:00]  That's some great audio.  Tom Cruise losing his mind.  Everyone's been talking about this the whole weekend.  It was the big celebrity story.  Team Boob Jobs.  What?  Obviously very hot, but also very disturbing.  What do you mean?  Teen Boob Jobs.  How is that disturbing?  Because it's girls that aren't even fully developed yet getting implants for graduation  and stuff.  I like it.  What do you get for your...  Oh, sorry.  You didn't graduate.  Graduate?  What do you get from the school of hard knocks, Opie?  That's right.  That's what I graduated from.  I went to the school of life, kid.  That's right. 
[01:07:30]  Old Asphalt U.  Yeah.  That's right.  What do you get for your graduation?  Besides, hopefully, a new windshield.  I got a thousand dollars from Mom and Dad.  Cool G.  Nice.  Cool G back in the day.  Nice.  It was very nice.  So, girls are getting boob jobs instead of money and stuff.  And then there's...  Gay Pride was this weekend.  Yes, it was.  As I was driving there, I almost skid across Fifth Avenue.  I haven't squeegeed the road clean yet.  We sent a couple of our young go-getters down there. 
[01:08:00]  Where's Nathaniel's?  Did Nathaniel go?  Because he's really good at this.  Yeah.  Oh, he's not working for us officially yet?  No.  He's not even here.  I don't know where he is.  Of course he's not here.  Yeah.  That old gag.  He's home.  He's okay?  Yeah.  They're all home, yet they still send in recorded material and stuff.  I see.  Okay.  Which is nice, you know.  Ben gave the thumbs up.  Oh, he did?  He gave the little thumbs up.  Let me see it, Ben.  There it is.  Aw, look at that.  Give us a hogs up.  Ben's in a good mood because his stupid socks are winning and winning and winning. 
[01:08:30]  Seven games in a row.  Seven games in a row.  Two games above.  Ben doesn't even do jokes at you, though.  He'll just list a fact.  He just does that.  Hey, dude.  Seven games in a row.  Seven games.  That's a lot of comedian like you.  Seven games, dude.  Isn't that wonderful?  And the Yankees' big thing is they have to like, oh, they didn't get swept by the Mets.  Oh, I love it.  And they're talking like it's the best thing ever.  Yeah.  Great.  Big meeting with the boss in Tampa tomorrow.  I know.  Gonna be things done.  Steinbrenner in Tampa.  I'm sick of them.  I'm glad they're getting their faces smashed. 
[01:09:00]  I don't want to see Giambi and Randy Johnson in Yankee uniforms.  Can there be no just enemies of your goddamn team?  Mm-hmm.  Holy shit, is that aggravating.  A-Rod's having a great year, though.  A-Rod is definitely...  I like A-Rod only because he was a bat for bat.  But why?  Stop buying it.  And I never was one of these guys that said the Yankees bought the team.  I was never one of these guys.  No.  I like farm system guys.  Fuck.  Bring them up.  Somebody you can watch over the years and appreciate their growth.  Well, there's talk they're going to trade their top three picks.  Of course they will. 
[01:09:30]  For who?  For some pitcher.  And it's either Barry Zito or something.  There you go.  Barry Zito sucks my dick.  The top three picks, Jim.  Like the top three prospects in the organization they're talking about.  Jesus Christ.  They deserve to get the shit beat out of them for that.  Goddamn Steinbrenner, when he was out of baseball, this team was built up.  And they won three out of four years.  Oh, is that frustrating?  Yes, it is.  God damn it.  Can we take one year where you just admit, like, all right, this is going to be an off 
[01:10:00]  year where you let some of that young talent develop?  Any team.  Pick your team around the country.  You'd rather give up the young talent, get a name, and flounder.  That fucking Barry Zito, I can't tell you how...  I'd rather have Bob Kelly's leg pitching for the Yankees than that fucking Barry Zito.  Cocksucker that's aggravating.  Catch my fist, Paul.  I hurt my dynasty, man.  God damn it, is that frustrating. 
[01:10:30]  Fucking Barry Zito.  And Randy Johnson.  What do you have in this?  That's one guy that's talking about a bunch of different pitchers, but he's one of the  ones that's taking back.  Yeah, who else?  We bring in Jim Abbott back, cocksucker.  Bob O'Hita.  Holy God, is that aggravating.  All right, we're going to break.  Also, tragic news in Paul McCartney's...  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Family there.  What?  Don't tell me.  Kickball competition?  Bad news for Paul McCartney over the weekend.  We'll get into that as well, so stay there. 
[01:11:00]  Life sends through the hourglass.  So is the over-day virus.  I'm assuming, in this whole religion thing, that you're not the same person you are now  in the afterlife.  I think...  I don't think you have your friends anymore.  Right.  I don't think you have, like, any possessions you want.  Things like that.  And everyone is treated the same.  You know, the Pope is wherever he is, saying, hey, I was the Pope, and everyone else is like,  whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever, dude.  That really wasn't that. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, because then there'd be a hierarchy.  Then there'd also be, what happens, you're, you know, 18 years old, you get married, your  wife dies, you remarry, now you're madly in love with this other person, and you both  die.  Now, what happens to the person you were so in love with that died, you finally get up  to heaven, that's your love, and you're going, hey, what do you do, Jim?  I don't know.  You probably just noticed that your ex has her head bobbing up and down in a black lap. 
[01:12:00]  You're like, well, I'm blessed that I met someone new.  You know, that's why that doesn't quite work out.  Like in Titanic, remember that?  She dies.  The old broad dies.  She goes back to Titanic.  She's all young again.  And there's Leonardo DiCaprio at the top of the stairs waiting for her.  What about some old guy that she was with later on in life?  She wasn't alone the whole time.  Hey, what about me, Rose?  Right.  Remember, you said you loved me.  And Leonardo, I'm back here with this guy. 
[01:12:30]  And you're trying to tell me Leonardo wasn't banging some heavenly ass as he was waiting?  He's sitting looking at that clock for 70 years or whatever the hell it is?  Stop it.  He's standing there all horned up, and this bag of meat gets on the ship, and he's like,  what the fuck happened to you?  Yeah, how come she's not old?  You look like shit.  She should be 80.  And why'd you throw that thing away?  We could have sold that.  That's all we had, Karen.  He was going to find it.  He threw it in the ocean, Henry.  He wouldn't have found it. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, that's stupid Hollywood for you, because, yeah, Leonardo dies young, leaves a, as they  say, a good-looking corpse.  Yep.  She goes on and lives until she's just a prune.  Oh, she should have come up those stairs, like, on a walker.  Oh, Jack, I'm back.  I waited 70 years.  You're an old bag.  We're finally back together.  You're an old hag, and I don't want to have sex with you.  You're kidding.  Leonardo looks down the stairs, and his words to his loved one.  Ah!  What happened? 
[01:13:30]  You said you left.  Exactly.  What happened?  Yeah, but Hollywood has to dolly it up and make her all young and hot again.  Stop.  Give my condolences to my old nice stash.  Gone.  Great pubes.  She's walking up the stairs with, like, you know, a blank canvas, a canvas, something  off.  Yeah.  Paint me again, Jack, like you did 70 years ago. 
[01:14:00]  I don't think I have enough gray paint.  Paint that.  I need gray, red, and blue for your veins.  I don't need any brown for your translucent nipples.  How do I know what old ladies' tits look like?  I know.  Isn't that frightening?  But he would be brown for inside the diaper.  Could you pick your tits up off the floor and put them back on the couch so I can get 
[01:14:30]  them all in one shot here?  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:15:00]  Why did I mention the McCartney story?  Why, why, why?  All right.  Can I just amend this real quick first before we do that, just because I have to, because  I'm going to get killed by these people.  What happened?  Just what happened in D.C.  Yeah, no.  Okay, okay.  Yeah.  We're teasing the McCartney.  Oh, the other one, because the other one, let's just say, safe to say that McCartney,  it's going to just be a not pretty radio segment.  It's going to be brutal.  Yeah.  I'm already embarrassed at my own things. 
[01:15:30]  After the Philadelphia thing, club started, Kenny was there.  We go out to get in the car.  There's a flat tire.  So, of course, thank God there was a man in the parking garage in Philly.  My tire's flat.  So me and Kenny changed the tire.  It looked a lot like Kenny changing the tire with me handing him lug nuts.  Of course it did.  While he sweated profusely and got filthy and had to go back in and wash up, while I  stood there pristine and clean with my fucking Mr. Rourke suit without a drop of oil on it.  That's my job. 
[01:16:00]  But I finally handed Kenny some lug nuts, so I can now say that we did it.  And my windshield got cracked.  It was a nightmare trip.  My opener canceled.  Gino couldn't make it because stupid Gino missed his flight.  Tried to call my buddy Chuck Miganelli, who made it down and destroyed.  Thank you, Chuck.  Just killed for me.  So, great job, buddy.  So, I get down to D.C. and the promoter recommends this hotel, the Doubletree Hotel, which just stinks.  I hated it.  It was awful.  They lied about the internet connection. 
[01:16:30]  They lied about the pillows they had.  It was a fucking disaster.  They lied about the internet connection.  Yeah, every room has high-speed internet.  Does it really?  Yeah, but it looks like dial-up.  The business center.  How do I jerk off in the business center, assholes?  The business center.  Hold on.  Their pillows?  I like...  This is almost in my rider.  I happen to like, and I need feather pillows.  Feathers.  I don't use rubber pillows.  I can't...  You know those rubber, awful foam pillows?  Yeah.  I can't sleep on...  Down pillows. 
[01:17:00]  My head has to go...  You want the life of many goose.  Yeah.  Deason.  Goosen.  It has to be like that.  I cannot sleep on rubber pillows.  Yeah.  I need down pillows.  Wow.  That's something I never knew about, Jimmy.  So I called down.  I'm like, we were told there were down pillows in this hotel.  And the guy's like, well, look, this is four in the morning.  Five in the morning.  He can't find any.  I'm like, we're checking out of this hotel immediately.  So club started, Kenny and I get up and get our stuff. 
[01:17:30]  And we start checking out.  And then the guy had to wake his manager up and take his pillow.  Oh, man.  You're kidding me.  So I had to go back and unload the car again because the man found pillows.  I was out of my mind.  Over pillows?  You don't understand.  If I don't have the pillows I want, there's a problem.  I one time in Baltimore had to leave the hotel and check into another one because I  started to rip up the pillows.  They were so bad.  The rage I felt at these fucking foam pillows.  If you like foam pillows, I hope your head just falls off.  Everyone should rebel against these goddamn things. 
[01:18:00]  I'd rather sleep on Alzar Cowey's floor than a foam pillow.  Some of them can be quite comfortable.  They're not comfortable.  Only feathers and down.  Right.  That's what I need.  I know.  Pillow diva.  Hey, I'll get a phone call for two weeks now.  Hey, Jim, how's that down pillow?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:18:30]  Ah!  Here they got feather pillows.  Yankees got feather pillows.  Ah!  Ah!  That's my new favorite thing you do, man.  It's a bad impression.  Oh, God.  So I get to Virginia.  The next night is show night.  What happened with this show was that it sold out.  There was 500 people, approximately, and that was a sellout.  Thanks to your new friend, Jay Leno.  Yes.  The tickets were selling well.  Jay, I did Leno, and then it just completely went clean. 
[01:19:00]  So my agent calls me.  He goes, look, the promoter wants to reconfigure the room and add a couple hundred seats.  Now, I only do seated shows.  I've been offered to do standing room only shows.  I turn them down.  I absolutely refuse to do shows where standing seats are sold.  I won't do them.  It's a rock show.  Jim Brewer can do that because of his actors.  He's a high-energy type music, so I can't do it.  You want people sitting there enjoying the comedy club atmosphere.  And I can honestly, if you want to talk, you know, the inside of it, I can make almost 
[01:19:30]  double the money doing standing shows because you can get almost double the people in.  Yep.  And then you're into percentages, and you can make a lot more money.  Play some boxcars on the way to Auschwitz.  Exactly.  Because you just hog them down in the back by the bar.  So I refuse to do them.  Central to the comedy effort.  So my agent knows this.  First thing I ask, will they be seated?  Yes, they will be.  And the way they can reconfigure a room, if anyone thinks I'm bullshitting, state theater  the first time I did it, sometimes they have a dinner theater set up where they'll have 
[01:20:00]  like round tables with bar stools around them or tables like a comedy club set up.  And they can reconfigure that into like theater seating, which is the way most rock clubs  are set up anyway, which is just long rows of seats like you'd get in any theater.  Yeah.  So it's not crazy to reconfigure a room to put more seats in it, whereas 500 could be a  sellout with one set up.  And you like to have a show sold out.  I mean, I don't think that's breaking a showbiz rule.  It looks better when a show is sold out because then people buy tickets faster because the  show is sold out.  They know they have to get tickets faster next time.  It's just a better time to sell out. 
[01:20:30]  Yep.  So we do the reconfiguration.  That sells out.  I'm very happy with that.  I get down there.  It's sound check.  Kenny calls me two hours before the show.  Oh, you know, there's going to be a couple hundred people standing.  And I go ballistic.  What do you what?  What the fuck do you mean?  People.  What are you talking about?  He goes, well, there's going to be a bunch of people standing right in front of the stage.  And all over the back.  And I go crazy.  I call my agent.  I go, what the fuck is this?  You co-sign this shit.  People standing up.  I went nuts. 
[01:21:00]  I mean, he goes, no seat for every person.  We talked about this.  This promoter.  We talked about this.  So he calls her.  He screams at her.  She's trying to back down.  No, no, it's a miscommunication.  No miscommunication.  Pete knows what I fucking what I do and what I don't do.  Right.  She tried to be slick.  And people are blaming Clear Channel.  This is a division of Clear Channel.  This is like a local promoter that falls under the umbrella of Clear Channel.  So ultimately, Clear Channel is responsible.  But it's almost like completely blaming CBS if one of their affiliates does something. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  I don't know enough about who knew what before.  And I will blast Clear Channel if this was them.  But this might have just been a local promoter fucking up.  Because we had a Clear Channel guy we wanted to bring in to do the show.  And the local promoter is like, no, no, no, we promise everything will be fine.  Because my guy in Philly is phenomenal.  So now we have a major fucking problem.  Because I have about 250 to 300 people who are going to be standing in this show.  And this happened to me in Cleveland years ago.  And it will never happen to me again.  I went fucking.  How do you have people standing stage side when other people are going to be sitting behind them? 
[01:22:00]  What the fuck was she thinking?  Holy shit, dude, that's my point.  You had to ask.  You had to ask.  I knew it was stupid too.  Like, then there's going to be people sitting that aren't going to be able to see the show.  She wanted to make more money.  So she's cramming all these people in.  I go crazy.  Yeah.  Pete gets her on the phone.  Kenny was at the house when it happened.  And he said Pete was yelling at her.  And she had to walk away from the house there because she was getting screamed at.  She guarantees they'll all be seated. 
[01:22:30]  So Pete calls me.  He goes, problem is solved.  They're going to seat everybody.  No problem.  I promise you they're all going to be seated.  Okay.  She calls back.  Hey, do you want to do a second show?  This is maybe an hour or half hour before the show.  Absolutely not.  We have a sellout.  We're not doing a second show.  For what?  We get 150, 200 people out here that want to buy tickets.  They're dying to get in.  The phones are still ringing off the hook.  And I'm thinking, well, maybe Ron and Fez talked about it.  Still, I don't want to do it.  They offered me good money.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Pete says, I don't think we should do it.  You have a sellout.  Come back into the market.  Do a bigger play.  You don't get greedy.  And that's one thing I love about my agent.  They're not greedy scumbags.  They handle Metallica and Billy Joel.  They don't need my extra fucking measly money.  You understand?  They're not scumbags.  So he says, maybe I could get her to such as, because I'm going, let's just see what  she's offering for another show, because I'm already there.  If she wants to, if there's fans that can't get into this show, we could do another show,  like a fan appreciation show.  And they want to pay me good.  Why wouldn't I do it?  I mean, we're there.  So he goes, all right, he got her to double what she was offering, which was really odd 
[01:23:30]  to me.  Like, why would she want me to do a second show?  For what?  For a couple of hundred people.  But I'm like, fuck it.  If that's what she wants to do, we will do the second show.  Wow.  Yeah.  So I do the first show, and it's fucking phenomenal.  It's one of the best shows.  And I can honestly tell you, that was one of the best shows I've had in a long time.  My opener destroyed.  I had a great fucking set.  It was fantastic.  Kenny tells me he's counting the room, because I want Ticketmaster counts now. 
[01:24:00]  I want a box office count, because there's some kind of problem going on with this promoter.  I want this taken care of.  I don't want to, I'm not getting fucked on the counts, and I don't want people getting  fucked.  Believe me, I'm crazy about this shit.  Yeah.  I never want people walking out of my shows with a problem, ever.  Kenny says there was like 500 or 550 people in the room, which was the original sellout.  And it looked like most of them were seated.  So I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?  I do the second show.  There might be 200 people there.  It's a good show.  The energy is off. 
[01:24:30]  It's not as good as the first show.  I like them.  They're a great crowd.  But there was something wrong.  Here's what happened.  Those people were all people that had been told they could not come into the first show  unless they wanted to stand up anyway, standing room.  They were basically told, you guys got to go to a second show.  This fucking promoter, because I went crazy about her lie, which was that there were seats  for everybody.  Even after she guaranteed Pete there were seats, there were no seats.  The seats had not been put in. 
[01:25:00]  Some extra ones had been put in, but not 300 worth.  They couldn't get them all in there.  So she just comes up with this second show.  150, 200 people waiting.  Those were people that already had first show tickets.  So these fucking poor people are sent home.  We're given the option of standing room, which I didn't want.  So these people are fucking obviously fuming.  And I found this out before the first show that this was going to happen.  So I took a poll from the audience.  I taped it.  I have it on tape.  How many of you guys were here for the first show?  They all go, yeah!  How many of you bought second show tickets? 
[01:25:30]  Maybe five people.  There really was never a second show.  Right.  It was all first show people.  People, they oversold the first show and then just came up with the second show idea.  Lying about having seats and then not thinking they were going to get caught until  I was on stage is slick shit promoters do.  For those people that got pushed back to a second show, I fucking never would have done  that, man.  I never would have just had you pushed back.  I mean, I love making money, but I would never risk my reputation in a market. 
[01:26:00]  And so I got an email from one of the fans.  And do you have this in front of you guys, this email?  Yeah, I got one.  Can I request, Anthony's always the best at this.  May I request that you read this to me?  Oh, let me see one.  Thank you very much.  Just don't read his name.  This guy, John.  Let's just say.  Yes.  I like the subject right away.  What was that?  Fuck you from a former fan who got fucked at the State Theater.  Oh, right.  And I was wondering, what's this about?  Hmm.  Yeah, with a subject line like that, you definitely open it up and take a peek. 
[01:26:30]  Thanks for the rod in the ass you gave me at the State Theater tonight, you fucking con  man.  I purchased four tickets from Ticketmaster at 12.01 p.m. on Saturday.  That Saturday the tickets went on sale.  I paid $25 per ticket plus $8 per ticket to Ticketmaster.  I show up at the State Theater, wait in the fucking 90 plus degree weather for an hour  to be told that I can either have standing room only or come back three hours later because  they talked the artist into doing a second show? 
[01:27:00]  Real fucking big of you.  You decide to give a performance for people who paid money to see it.  Your Lebanese cunt of a tour promoter couldn't be more full of shit.  She told my wife to give her her card.  She was going to talk to Ticketmaster and see if she could get us a refund for our fee.  I'll hold my breath waiting for that return call.  She couldn't be more full of shit.  She knew what the capacity of the club was and purposely overbooked it. 
[01:27:30]  I talked to the club owner for about 20 minutes.  He told me they were sold out, but we reconfigured the hall so we'd have more seats.  It was the biggest bunch of bullshit that he ever heard.  Those are words coming from your mouth.  What did they do?  Build a fucking Florida room in the back?  He has a club and just figures out that he should set it up to maximize the number of people that can get in. 
[01:28:00]  He was man enough to refund us our purchase price plus Ticketmaster fee out of his own pocket  plus give us passes for the next show of our choice.  He did it because he didn't want the stink of your sleazy bullshit on his reputation.  He told us he rented the hall to Clear Channel and was mortified to be associated with this fucking debacle.  It's a real fucking shame because I was a huge fan.  My wife was starting to be a fan and we brought another couple with us to turn on to you. 
[01:28:30]  I liked you because of the things you said you, uh, I liked you because of things you said like how you hated the airlines  because they, uh, fucking see how many people they could cram on a plane with not thought of their comfort.  It's the exact same thing when you reconfigure the club and start selling more tickets to a sold out show.  What a fucking hypocrite.  Well, welcome to the list of asshole performers that I once enjoyed but no longer will pay a penny to their product 
[01:29:00]  because they're such miserable fucking human beings.  Things are going good for now.  Keep fucking people over and see how long that lasts.  It's a shame that your talent seems to be equaled by your fucking money-grubbing,  Clear Channel-sucking, douchebag-drinking sleaze.  Thanks, fucker.  Now, this guy, um, wow, first of all, wow.  He was slightly irritated.  This is, I was going to say, I think he's a little pissed.  A fucking pissed-off fan. 
[01:29:30]  And I wrote him back.  Blaming you, you, you.  And I wrote him back and he said, well, that's the type of shit, of course, don't blame yourself.  And I wrote him again.  And eventually he calmed down and he's like, look, dude, I was just a fan.  And I guess the fact that I wrote him back a couple times, he realized that I told him the truth about what happened.  And I forwarded this to my agent.  I'm like, this is the way fans are going to perceive what happened.  Absolutely.  And, um, my agent talked to him.  He's going to be confident to another show.  He's cool about it now.  He understands.  But that's why I explained that reconfiguration.  Because the way he words it, that's how I'd see it if I was a fan. 
[01:30:00]  You fucking scumbag.  You're going to reconfigure a sold-out show.  But honest to God, man, a rock club like that that has no built-in seating structure can have comedy club seating with tables and stuff.  And then just be set up into rows like a theater seating.  And that's very, very common.  That was not a lie.  Had I known it was sold out, that perfect audience of 500 and something people that was there.  Yeah.  A mobbed, perfectly quiet, listening, everything you want is a comedy audience show that was.  I would never have wanted that oversold. 
[01:30:30]  I would have flipped that into a second show in a second if I would have known that was exactly the problem.  I swear to God I would never have done that.  I'm not that fucking greedy.  And as far as the promoter, I never fucking met her.  She would not come into the dressing room.  She would not even come look at me.  She stayed in the office the entire time.  And this is not even a reflection on the state theater.  Because promoters rent from the people.  The state theater guy, I think, was extremely embarrassed about this.  I was extremely embarrassed about this.  The promoters don't give a shit because it's not their name and their face. 
[01:31:00]  It's Jim Norton and it's state theater.  So to the fans that got fucked about this, this is, look, just look at my track record, please, of interaction with fans.  I would never stick my dick in the fans like this.  I just, I don't do it.  I've never done it and I never would do it.  I always try to give you a good show.  This type of backlash is, it's a deserved email.  This was, this guy was enraged.  I mean, to think that they would cut a line off and tell these fucking poor people that they had to just come back, tough shit, or have standing room only. 
[01:31:30]  Which I specifically said no standing room in my shows.  So even after all this bullshit, this bitch is still offering standing room.  She didn't want to admit that she had gotten caught lying.  And my agent, who is an animal and has an amazing reputation, he's not a scumbag at all.  Believe me, these are guys that told me to turn down certain TV things, even though they would have made money off it because it wasn't right for me.  These are guys that make enough off their other clients.  They don't need the extra few dollars I'm going to give them for fucking cramming people into a show and wrecking it.  And it just, so my apologies that this happened, I swear to God, I never would have purposely done this to you. 
[01:32:00]  Ever.  Ever.  I have never seen an email at somebody so pissed off.  And I did again, this guy, we did finally make it right with this guy.  I mean, we explained what happened.  It's like, dude, you got fucked.  And it's just, honest to God, I couldn't have seen that coming.  So he talked to the owner of the club?  Yeah.  And the owner was like, reconfigure, that's bullshit.  No, no, no, no, the guy knew about the reconfiguring.  Yeah.  But the guy probably didn't know that I had had a no.  Nothing to do with it. 
[01:32:30]  No, no, no, a no standing rule.  When they said reconfigure, again, to me, that's theater seating being laid out in rows.  This guy knew it was reconfigured after a sellout, but that's not a completely uncommon thing to do.  He probably didn't realize that standing room was an absolute no-no for me.  Right.  I never would have signed on for that.  Why?  Even though I could make more money doing it, it fucks up the show.  It's not a fun show.  Yeah, you don't want to do that.  I want to be able to pause.  I want to be able to relax.  I want to be able to do the jokes the way I want to do them without going, you know, this fucking manic concert page.  I don't want to have to do that because it's not as fun and the show isn't as good.  All right.  Let's go to the phones. 
[01:33:00]  They've exploded, obviously.  Let's say hi to Chuck.  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, I think Jimmy needs the Paul Anker clause in his contract now that the fans get seats.  The fans get seats.  The fans get seats.  You know what?  Absolutely.  That is a contractual thing.  And believe me, if we were lying, if I all of a sudden changed my tune last minute, they would have went ballistic and threatened to sue me.  If I said, I'm not doing standing room with a sold-out show, she would have said to me, you motherfucker, if you don't do this, we will sue your balls off.  If you try to, you think she would have paid me extra money to do a second show for people who had already paid for a first, they would have threatened to sue me in a second. 
[01:33:30]  She knew she was wrong.  She knew that we were right.  And everybody knew we were right.  And she got fucked financially for it.  But the fans got screwed, too.  And I feel sick about that.  I really do.  All right, Tom, you're at the show Friday.  Yeah.  It was an awesome show.  Thank you.  The problem was, though, is, you know, we stood in line for the hour.  And, I mean, this was like at 7 o'clock.  And then all of a sudden we get up toward the front, and I would say probably a horde of at least 100 people started going in in front of us. 
[01:34:00]  They started coming out saying, anybody with reservations?  Who has reservations?  And everybody's looking around going, what the fuck do you mean, reservations?  You know, never heard of that.  You know, if you're a ticket master or anything.  So I think that was a little bit of a problem.  So we stood in the back because we didn't want to come back.  But awesome show.  Awesome show.  All right, Tom.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you. 
[01:34:30]  Let's go to Steve.  Hey, Steve, what's up?  Hey, I had a comment about Jimmy's opening song for his set.  Yeah.  He comes out to National Acrobat, and I think fluff would be more appropriate for his body shape.  Actually, a very obscure Sabbath reference, but thank you, sir.  Wow.  Lennon Cleveland, go ahead.  Hi, guys.  This is Lennon Cleveland, of course.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  I just bought tickets for your show Friday at 10.01.  My wife and I are just dying to see him.  And plainly, on Ticketmaster, it says that the Odeon standing room only.  No, no, no.  This is going to be seated. 
[01:35:00]  I had a problem with the Odeon one time.  That's probably what the Odeon lists.  But I had a problem with the Odeon.  The first time I did the Odeon with Keith years ago, I fucking threw my water against the wall in the dressing room because they had people standing in the back.  That will be a seated show.  Capacity is much less than it would be standing.  That's probably a standard thing with the Odeon, but when I do it, it is a seated show.  And Pete knows that.  If that promoter...  Fans get seats.  The fans get seats.  Who the fuck wants to stand for a comedy show?  No one.  You don't stand for jokes. 
[01:35:30]  Comics are not...  I'm sorry.  I'm not a rock guy.  It's not what I do.  I talk about my fat tits.  You sit.  But the Odeon will be seated.  If you have to stand at the Odeon, I will set the fucking entrance to that place on fire.  And I will slaughter the promoter with a knife.  Jesus.  That's not happening.  We worked out that problem three years ago in Cleveland.  All right.  Why don't we take a break here and we'll continue, I guess.  All right.  Right.  You feel better?  I do, man.  I just...  An email like that bothers me because I really do. 
[01:36:00]  And I can't be mad at the guy.  And by the way, sir, I agree with your assessment of the promoter, although I never...  She never showed her fucking face to me.  Ever.  But we haven't talked to anybody from Clear Child because this happened Saturday night  and, of course, Sunday.  And now it's Monday morning at, you know, 8.45 a.m.  So my agent comes in at 10.  So this will be taken care of today.  All right.  No problem.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no.  I'm going to give up my virginity.

[01:39:30]  you believe that  are they going to be able to get us too  i know  the soldiers would love that man  they love it  i think they're looking at this as more of an emergency  type uh...  almost like the emergency broadcast system  but only for the military  to then use uh...  yeah  our satellites  to to communicate  with each other  you know  over over the xm  uh...  that would be funny  if their communications  get screwed up by the coffee diva song  uh...

[01:42:00]  I wonder who brokered that deal  like  how did they get involved  were they approached by the military  I guess  you're gonna have to ask ELO  code name ELO  on a side note  there's another ass out there  just trashing you and me  and old Jimmy Norton  yeah  because they don't get sarcasm  ah  some dude that does like  I don't know  I wrote about tech  tech stuff  and  the gaming thing  I think  the gaming magazine  oh it was in the gaming magazine  G3 right  I don't know if it's 
[01:42:30]  I don't  I think it's just a website  I don't even think it's a magazine  guys all pissed off  because being sad brain  how big the  the serious units are  to know in fact  they are bigger than the XM units  what a jerk off  by a lot  what a fucking jerk off  this guy doesn't get  exaggerated humor  and the guy is such a dweeb  so he trashed us bad  in this article  really?  what did he say?  I don't know  he said we suck  something about being  um  uh  what the hell were we 
[01:43:00]  racist?  oh cool  oh there we go  of course we are  and then uh  he called Jimmy bad names  and stuff  aw  I don't have the article  you fucking faggot  can someone find that article  and highlight the good stuff  oh what's the  here's the bottom line  can they turn that down  fucking sliced already  Eric  so I'm really with us today  Eric you're a little behind today  I just want to  um  acknowledge that  I don't know why  we need to talk over  the Top Gun music  just wait a minute  fucking bits over  we moved on  reading news stories 
[01:43:30]  quieter on a carrier deck  bum bum bum bum bum  right  we don't have it  in front of us Eric  alright we'll get a copy  oh I'd like to  bite his fucking face  I don't care if he doesn't  like the fact we trash  serious  yeah  but then here's  here we go  here's where the political  and the fucking  social beliefs  ideology creeps  into humor  gotta get upset  that we're racist  and probably sexist  whoever you are  that's pretty much it  that's exactly what it is  why don't you just be honest  about what your agenda is  you don't like  what we make fun of  his agenda was also  um  I guess being a stern fan 
[01:44:00]  well that's fine  and he didn't want  the serious units  to be goofed on  just let him be honest  about it  I like Howard  I think these guys suck  alright  just be honest  there's nothing that  makes me sicker  than when somebody  hides behind something else  you know what I mean  like if you're a stern fan  just say that's where you are  and come from that  honest point of view  it's fine  we're not afraid of that  douchebag  I don't like  when you make  racial human  beyond AM  beyond FM  it's XM  satellite radio  is he right  that many of his  best friends  are African 
[01:44:30]  slash American  many of my  best friends  are African  slash American  I don't say black  because I'm elitist  and white  and black  is an ugly word  to me deep down  and I'm afraid  if I say it  it will show  how intellectually  superior I really  think I am  shithead  black's an ugly  little word for you  is it  alright we'll move on  they'll find the article  we'll go back  where's that article  Hawk for Pete's sake  picture Elo  walking around  in like a general's  uniform  like a military 
[01:45:00]  uniform  Vexem has something  to do with the  army like that  see them all  walking around  his helmet haircut  looking like he took  a shot to the head  pick up your  fucking Pete  Rose wig  like he took a  mortar round  to the skull  I was reading a  whole article  on Saturday  radio over the  weekend  in Talkers magazine  Talkers  they had the  players from the  two companies  talking and  what a borefest  really  a complete and  utter borefest  and I work for  XM 
[01:45:30]  obviously we all  you know  I don't even know  what the company  does after reading  this article  you get some  big wigs get  together and start  talking about it  and they lose  sight of what  people really  are going to be  excited about  it's Talkers magazine  so you are  talking to this  the industry  this elite group  of people that  would care that  deeply but they  talk in such a  corporate way that  you're like what  what  they're selling  widgets  what  nothing to do  with  and they got  to make sure  they mention all  the programming  you know they  kind of weave it  through their  their interview 
[01:46:00]  it's just awful  absolutely awful  yeah  and then in the  same Talkers  magazine  one of our old  enemies was in  there  remember the  radio chick  oh yeah  she's doing a  show for the  competition now  and she's  she's going out  with like the  drummer from  Vanilla Fudge  Vanilla Fudge  Carmine Apathy  yeah that guy  she's dating  Carmine Apathy  yeah  he played with  Ozzy  I've met  Carmine  he did play  with Ozzy 
[01:46:30]  he played  I've been  he played  with Sabby  yeah Carmine  honestly  played with  everybody  honestly  you know  this article  you know  he seems like  he's a cool  guy but  the radio chick  she was all  about how  look at me  and my  luscious  boobs  she would  talk about  how hot  her tits were  and stuff  even though  they're the  saggiest  things I've  ever seen  in my life  and she  tries to  act all  sexy and  hot on  the radio  and the  reality is  she's going  out with a  guy that's  well into  his 60s  is he  yeah I  would say  so  right  if you're  saying that  you're the  radio chicken 
[01:47:00]  you're hot  and stuff  wouldn't it  be  I don't know  you would  assume that  she's going  out with  someone maybe  around her age  which is  I think she's  pushing 50  by now  or maybe  a boy toy  yeah  but not  someone well  into his 60s  my god  she's a  she's a  chippy for  him  and then she's  talking about  how the sex  is great  with the guy  and hey  and Jesus  do we have  to hear that  and she  faked it  the first  time they  had sex  or something  but since  then she  hasn't  and the  sex is  really good  I was  getting  nauseous  reading this 
[01:47:30]  fucking thing  what  diddly  how did I not  list  oh there's Ozzy  the article  says he's  60 something  so  this guy looks  like Joel  Steinberg  with a  Beatles wig  whatever  he performed  with Nugent  Rod Stewart  Vanilla Fuzz  the guy's  huge  Boat Diddly  Ozzy  Paul Stanley  Pink Floyd  Jeff Beck  King Culver  this guy's  unbelievable  what if he's  a good bang  it's just a quick  it's just a quick  observation  because we  worked with her  and she  she tries to 
[01:48:00]  you know  put out this  persona that  she's this  hot babe  but the reality  is she's  dating someone  well into  his 60s  a little strange  yikes  you know  love is love  I guess  but Jesus  that's right  Opie  what's wrong  with someone  dating someone  younger  alright  why don't we  get into  the gay pride  parade everybody  oh  gay pride  was this weekend  was it all over  the country  or just New York  oh now we got  this  alright  alright  yeah we'll go  back to this  so it's  hardcore analyst 
[01:48:30]  Todd  Todd Hargosh  Hargosh  and this is just  a web based  thing  this isn't a  print magazine  this is just  some web based  he does  he does an  article  and I guess  it's usually  about gaming  technology  and shit  like that  archaic  and huge  egos  oh he's a  Donna Mike  fan  whatever  alright so  he's talking  about  I guess  he was  I don't 
[01:49:00]  get this  is he a  fan of  Sirius or  XM  he's a  fan of  cock  and black  cock  I guess  he was going  to the  electronics  show  was he  and  yeah  and decided  he was going  to subscribe  to XM  he's a loyal  listener to  Sirius  I've been  happy with  their service  but he does  have some  issues  so he  wanted to  try out  XM  alright  so the week  before he  found a great  deal on an  XM dealer  site  which offered 
[01:49:30]  the MiFi  light  rather than  paying 300  bucks  for MiFi  can I back  you up  oh you are  going there  I'm sorry  keep going  Anthony  sorry  because this  paragraph  just shows you  what kind of  person he is  what he got  excited about  as far as  XM goes  yeah  he bought  the MiFi  portable unit  battery  AC charge  total cost  only 100  bucks  plus  activation  he got  home from  E3  he added  additional  parts  to complete  the XM  experience  he got  the specially  designed  car antenna  the home  kit  it still 
[01:50:00]  was far  far cry  from the  original  cost of  the full  kit  so I guess  he was  happy with  the price  needless to  say my  first impressions  of XM  were high  I noticed  far less  repetition  in the music  channels  and much  to my  delight  there were  stations  that played  songs that  I have  never heard  in over  20 years  add in  a station  called  Cinemagic  which played  nothing but  movie soundtracks  and I was  in heaven  the fact that  Cinemagic  played mostly  Star Wars music 
[01:50:30]  in honor of  the release of  episode 3  was a big  plus  wow  this guy's  not a fan  this guy's  an uber  nerd  he's more  than a nerd  he enjoyed  Star Wars music  on the radio  that should come  with a man's  hand on the  back of your  head  you fucking  jerk off  how could  he not  be a fan  of this  show  when he's  such a  big geek  hey  and then  here we go  Todd  Hargosh  but when I  checked  XM's talk 
[01:51:00]  stations  it was a  completely  different story  in particular  my problems  concentrated on  two individuals  Greg  O.B.U.'s  and Anthony  Cubia  what a douche  spelled  Camilla  Camilla  now I have  followed these  two back in  2000  when they  arrived on  WJFK as  part of a  syndication deal  that also  allowed Don  and Mike to  broadcast on  New York  station WNEW  sure the 
[01:51:30]  program had  its moments  but most of  it was  unbearable  and made  even worse  whenever I  heard their  associate  a bald  headed  big mouth  bigot  named Jim  Norton  shoot off  his mouth  why do I  have to be  a bigot  I'm a big  mouth  I'm a bald  zero  but why do I  have to be  a bigot  because I do  racial healing  I didn't know  we were working  with Nortchi  Bunker  oh it's just  bigot  it's just  awful  it turned out  that I was not  the only one  appalled by  these three 
[01:52:00]  as JFK  and here we go  as JFK's  afternoon drive  ratings went  from first  during Don  and Mike's  era  to 17th  he put an  exclamation point  to really  drive his  gaming point  home  how about  we were  doing very  well  during our  tenure  on JFK  and  we would  have still  been there  had we not  been fired  for the same  passing  unlike Don  and Mike  who were thrown  out of New York  because their  ratings stunk  so bad 
[01:52:30]  and Buffalo  and many other  markets  and the fact  is  this guy  you go back  to being honest  the fact  is  the show  was still  number one  men  18 of 49  that's the only  reason that  Anthony and I  were in business  on commercial  radio  they didn't  give a fuck  about overall  ratings  they didn't  give a fuck  about women  they didn't  give a fuck  about young  men  it was all  about men  18 of 49  and we were  number one  and then you  that was the  money  you jump  into a market  where a show  has been there  forever  and been  number one  forever 
[01:53:00]  and then you  displace them  and jump in  of course  it's going to  be a slow  build  but it was a lot  faster than  Don and Mike's  in New York  that's for sure  why don't you  mention what  they went from  and they weren't  number one  men 18 of 49  in New York  no  Todd  we're trying to  get him on the  phone so I  guarantee he won't  call back  but let's say  he does  but on XM  they're much  worse  their constant  obsession  with attacking  Howard Stern  is one thing  I'll get to  that later  will he  obsession  how about  it's just  how about  it's repression  how about 
[01:53:30]  that fucking  asshole Howard  kept us quiet  for four years  whatever that we  were over there  by running to  the boss  and crying  so we couldn't  talk about him  so how about  we're just  getting it off  our chest  now  Todd  why don't you  mention that  we don't spend  that much time  on Howard  it comes up  from time  to time  of course it  does  we slap him  around a bit  we have a little  fun with it  yeah we slap  him around a bit  and then we move  on  and he's got  a little picture  it's got like  a little gun  and it's got  Anthony and the  OPD caricatures  and he has  bullet holes in him  and it's called  Todd's firing line 
[01:54:00]  yeah and it's got  a picture of him  next to him  wow  with an ironic  look on his face  like you don't  want to get  my firing line  guys  that's right  look out  we don't know  what to do  about this  look out  oh this guy  is a jizz bag  Todd Hargosh  yeah  we have to  give out his  website of course  so people can go  check him out  I think he's  terrific  on the gaming  site  you find him  game industry  dot com  game industry dot com  slash Hargosh  give him a plug 
[01:54:30]  I think they'll  get a couple  of hits  today  yeah  I hope you  guys check  him out  and by the  way  it says here  Todd's other  interests include  and you can  tell him exactly  what you think  of his reviews  or just send  him a note  to reviews  at game  industry dot com  there you go  that's reviews  at game  industry dot com  you may want  to enjoy  his reviews  one thing  that really  got me  irked  is their  current assault  on the media  did he really  write irked  irked  dude  if you're 
[01:55:00]  irked  because of the  assault on the  media  because  and I'm  speculating here  but I assume  this  because you  actually think  you're part of  the media  then I kind of  feel sorry for  you  you're a blog  you're one of  many people  writing on a  website that  no one knows  about  please  this guy  probably  actually thinks  he's part of  the media  basically 
[01:55:30]  what happens  is a member  of ONA's  cult  sneak up  on feel  reporters  hold up  posters of  ONA and  yell out  stuff like  Opie and  Anthony  XM radio  my god  wow  these attacks  would occur  at the most  inappropriate  settings  one of which  actually took  place when a  reporter was  covering a  rape scene  for crying  out loud  that's probably  what she did  reporter was  covering a  rape scene  for panties  around the  ankles  and a punch  to the face  he was 
[01:56:00]  covering  he was  covering a  rape scene  for short  skirt and  high heels  that she  shouldn't have  went out with  wait a  word  it's stupid  reporter  yeah  covering a  rape scene  and they were  reporting it  because they  were so  concerned  for worrying  about AIDS  the rest  of your  life  out loud  oh that's  funny  no one 
[01:56:30]  oh  and then  the reporter  was covering  a rape scene  for spouse  that can no  longer look  her in the  eye  because he  subconsciously  thinks she's  dirty  wow  you made  Kelsey fall  down again  Jimmy  Kelsey  Jesus  well alright  I was just  being a bigot  here's a good 
[01:57:00]  example of him  doing his  research  no one was  affected more  in the assault  on the media  than Anthony  Chien  that's right  how about you  douche  Arthur  dick bag  Anthony  Chien  people can't  get over the  fact that we  got a reporter  fired  I love it  it's amazing  I absolutely  love it  because he was  stupid enough  to turn around  and start cursing  on live TV  it's our problem  yeah okay  yeah 
[01:57:30]  two guys came  up behind him  you know the  story  said Opie and  Anthony XM  radio  Chien turned  around and  yells what the  fuck is your  problem man  little did he  know the  program was  still live  and as a  result  Chien was  fired  no he knew  the program  was still  live  yes he did  he didn't even  pause  and then he  just goes up  granted reporters  are supposed to  be professional  and not snap  out in the way  Chien did  who Anthony  Chien you idiot  but still when  someone's pressure  like that reacting  is in that way 
[01:58:00]  is understandable  another jerk off  justifying and  over explaining  Arthur Chien's  behavior instead of  letting him as  an adult take  responsibility for  his potty mouth  another jerk off  but what makes me  really mad  oh you didn't get  that this is pretty  good though  what's that  in my opinion  Opie and Anthony  should take some  responsibility for  these actions  there is the right  and wrong way to  get attention  I know by writing  this I'm helping  them out  oh believe me 
[01:58:30]  we are helping  you  this is a case  where we sir  are assisting  you  how many people  read this guy's  whatever it is  reviews at  gameindustry.com  maybe you're a  new fan of this  guy's column  maybe you agree  with what he's  saying feel free  to write him  and tell him  that you agree  alright continue  man sorry  but what makes  me really mad  at these two  are the way  they make  blatant lies  about Sirius  recently Sirius  unveiled their 
[01:59:00]  Sportster replay  a follow up  to their top  selling tuner  the replay  features buffer  memory that  allows at least  44 minutes of  replay capability  wow  wow  wow  okay terrific  did you see  the box  it says listen  for almost  45 minutes  I know  that's what  you see  upsell a little  he  shithead  you made our  point stupid  he even couldn't  he even couldn't  go with it  because he had  to write at least  at least 
[01:59:30]  to confuse you  a little bit  44 minutes  you could get  upwards of 46  maybe  or is it  45-30  oh god  that is funny  and by the way  the line I used  at CES  was congratulations  they just reinvented  the tape recorder  which was an  accurate line  that wasn't  slamming it  you silly goose  however  Open Anthony  in their not  so divine  wisdom  ridiculed the  replay  comparing it  with of all  things  the MiFi  a completely  different model  yeah  a better model  yeah  one is portable  and one isn't 
[02:00:00]  right  it's different  because it's  better  one you can  listen to live  one you can't  you're right  different model  why are you  comparing  this Ferrari  to this Rambler  exactly  the guy is  making our  point  don't compare it  with something  really good  that people  enjoy  that has  hours of  replay capability  and he goes  why  because it  stores five  hours of music  for portable  use  this is the  MiFi 
[02:00:30]  and also  because O&A  would do  anything to  bring Sirius  down  right  no you  ass  we know  Sirius is  going to  survive  Jesus  but just  that a  grown man  would write  do anything  to bring  Sirius down  and then put  an exclamation  point at the  end  you really  should have  your writing  hand smashed  with a mallet  you're not  a good writer  you're not  a good writer  this guy's awful  anyone who  follows Satellite  Radio Market  like I do  knows the  real competition  for the  sports to  replay is  XM's  Delphi  SkyFi 2  and in that 
[02:01:00]  comparison  the sports  to replay  is 44 minutes  and easier  to read  display  yeah no  shit easy  to read  because it's  a big screen  like a  plasma television  on your  windshield  they actually  have one  mounted on  42nd street  in Times Square  and it has  a stock ticker  running across  it  you asshole  Todd  see Todd  it's really  big  that's what  we're getting  at  it's really  big  it's really  big  I've seen  these things  on the  friggin  windshields  have you  seen them  yeah you can  see the  display 
[02:01:30]  but you  can't  see the  road  yeah you  can't  see the  goddamn  road  you have  to  sacrifice  what  happened  Hawk's  yelling  at  Jimmy  Hawk is  yelling  at  Jimmy  no I  just said  just  move back  a little  bit  he's  distorting  that's  all  he was  distressing  because he  was  no when  he was  yelling  Jimmy you  talk into  that mic  any goddamn  way you  want  right  right  right  Hawk  how do I  sound  yeah great  now Jimmy's  out of the  program  now he's  all self  conscious  Jimmy's  now outside  the door  I bet you  Todd Hargosh  is happy  the bigot 
[02:02:00]  has been  quiet  right  shut up  you bigot  I guess  Hawk doesn't  like what he's  hearing from  you  pals with  old Todd  there  Hawk  oh really  we really  thought you  were  not at  all  way to  go  at the  bit  Hawk  Jesus  what are  you  what are  you  an  Islamic  terrorist  I don't  think so  I don't  think so  not at  all  guys  I think  you have  your facts  wrong  sir  I certainly  am not  for Pete's  sake  and you 
[02:02:30]  can't  compare  and this  guy is  right about  the two  things  you can't  compare  it's  like  comparing  apples  and  refrigerator  boxes  Todd  Hargosh  is a  bag  of jizz  but the  bigger lie  that gets  to me  more than  anything  everything  progressively  gets to him  more and  more  except Star Wars  music  he loves  hearing that  pumped out  through the  speakers  that calms  him  is how  Opie and  Anthony  refer to  serious  radios as  archaic  and huge  this is  complete 
[02:03:00]  bravo  Sierra  that was  his big  point  and I  guarantee  most people  that read  that said  what does  that mean  this is  complete  bravo  Sierra  please  tell me  please tell  me what  bravo  Sierra  it is  in  you really  know what  it is  yes  you know  what bravo  Sierra means 
[02:03:30]  you know  how they  talk  alpha  bravo  right  tango  sure  tango  and cash  bravo  Sierra  please  please  let me just  cut you off  and if you  tell me that  this is kind  of a thing  for BS  like bullshit  I'll fucking  I will throw  coffee at you  just because  you're the  messenger  no don't  throw it  I got my  coffee ready  no don't  throw coffee  at me  if you tell  me that  Todd  is actually  writing bravo  Sierra as a  way to say 
[02:04:00]  bullshit  on his  non-profanity  internet site  I'll throw  up into the  microphone  that is  complete  bravo  Sierra  well I'm  being  I don't  mean to be  such a  bigot  but this  guy is  a real  nutty  lover  this  guy  wow  it's BS  yeah  dude you're  a grown  man  yeah  how do  you write  bravo  Sierra 
[02:04:30]  as a  little  thing  as a  man  how do  you do  that  I am  appalled  I'm more  appalled that  Anthony knows  what bravo  Sierra means  well Anthony's  just a genius  forget  Aristotle  and fuck  Socrates  here comes  Professor  Anthony  guys obviously  a real  Charlie sucker  I like the  way we're  copying out  of the last  word  yeah I  know  you're using  sucker for  sucker  well I could  have said  Sierra  using his 
[02:05:00]  alright go  ahead Anthony  I hope this  guy has sex  with someone  and gets  apples  why would he  wish fruit  on me  I don't even  like fruit  fucking literal  idiot  I own both  a MiFi  and a  Sports to  replay  of course  you do  and aside  from form  factor and  overall function  they're the  exact same  size  serious  smaller radio  the smallest  star made  oh smallest  is identical  in form  factor and  size to  XM's roadie  too  but then again  do you expect 
[02:05:30]  what do you  expect from a  couple of  Howard Stern  rip offs  who are in  XM's back  pocket  ding ding ding  there we go  the Howard Stern  angle  can I just  interject how  ironic it is  once again  that a guy  again this is  what a liar  this guy is  it's like  I'm a bigot  all of the  racial stuff  that Howard  has done  in his show  which is fine  and I'm all  for that  he's got a  colored lady  over there  so he gets  away with it  but do you  understand  and then to  point out  a black lady  in a dunkin booth  that you guys  are wrong to  have  in a dunkin booth 
[02:06:00]  a dunkin booth  yeah you're  a dunkin booth  dunkin  that was awful  you're right  I didn't catch it  Jesus  I'm sweating  again  but to have  an assault on  the media  as being wrong  again I'd like  to know why  you're not writing  and I mentioned  this point  but why aren't  you writing  talking about  how he played  footage of  somebody  doing a prank  call over  a murder  at LL Airlines  about Artie  Lang  or how about  talking about  someone saying  that they were  in the burning  towers  on a terrorist  attack  in 1993 
[02:06:30]  and again  I'm not  I'm obviously  not a Stern  fan  but he should  have played  those calls  but if you're  going to  criticize one  how do you  disingenuously  not criticize  the other  that's what  bugs me  there's these  scumbags  like this  who are just  fucking  agenda driven  liars  be a man  faggot  and just say  what you want  to say  without hiding  behind  it's a tech  thing  just say  what it is  you want  to say  man  holy shit  I don't think  Sirius has  anything to fear  from these  two blowhards  what is this  guy  someone's 
[02:07:00]  grandpa  blowhards  why you  are we  full of bunk  you're full  of bunk  mister  yeah  for Pete's  sake  that's  bravo  Sierra  he talks  about  my mother  likes  a blue  car  and her  muffin  well  you can  fast forward  to the end  of the article  cause  yeah  well  earlier this  month  infinity  broadcasting  turned  New York's  oldie station  into a  format  known as  Jack  which acts  like iPod  shuffle  on crack  you know 
[02:07:30]  funny  anything  on crack  it's like  an iPod  shuffle  on crack  what have we  got here  fucking  comedian  in the same  vein let me  say this guy  is the writer  from hell  one of the 
[02:08:00]  DJs that lost  his job in  New York  was a legend  Bruce Morrow  also known as  cousin Brucey  it was a  travesty  so atrocious  even a  New York  state  senator  demanded  someone  hire  cousin  Brucey  since he  was such  a staple  to the  Big Apple  that  that just  isn't true  he was  he's like  anybody else  that has  that kind  of a  history  in radio  that's about  it  you don't have  a shitload  of listeners  anymore  that's for 
[02:08:30]  sure  a few  old people  that like  oldies  were upset  that the  guy that  was introing  the records  got fired  well Sirius  responded  as they  added  Morrow  to their  camp  like that's  a big  thing  for the  nation  like that's  a big  thing  for the  United States  of America  a national  radio company  and that's  the difference  between the  two companies  XM took a  peek at  cousin Brucey  and said  you know  what it's  going to  cost too  much  money  and in  a couple  months  no one's  going to  care  anymore  and then  you're  stuck  with the  bill  XM is 
[02:09:00]  doing  things  smarter  they're  worried  about  getting  factory  install  deals  and making  units  that you  don't  fucking  strain  your back  picking up  not hiring  some  fucking  cousin Brucey  is fine  but that  fucking  awful  Martha Stewart  seven million  a year  and just  hemorrhaging  cash  picking up  these  talent  that gets  maybe a  blurb in  the paper  and they're  just  hemorrhaging  cash  with things  like getting  cousin Brucey  and this  the  radio  Margaritaville  he's crowing  about here 
[02:09:30]  the Jimmy  Buffett  channel  he goes  while I'm  not a  Parrothead  per se  he's 75  years old  it may  surprise many  of my  readers  that I  do enjoy  listening to  Buffett  and I've  been impressed  with the  station so  far  now what  would surprise  your readers  is if you  actually liked  pussy  right  that's what  would surprise  your readers  what a  complete  tool  this guy  is  he's posing  in his 
[02:10:00]  bio pictures  with chicks  and he  just looks  like the  biggest  redheaded  douchebag  geek  I've ever  seen  Todd  Hargosh  Hargosh  I don't want to be in Todd's firing line  catching his bravo  sierra  bravo sierra  what a complete ass 
[02:10:30]  did you read the end of it by the way  did you have to finish it up  yeah  that's what I want to get  it gets really good  oh one thing for sure  Sirius is nowhere near archaic  but they definitely are huge  with their aspirations  wow he got me there  I thought he was agreeing  and then all of a sudden  with their aspirations  oh this guy is good  at sucking a cock 
[02:11:00]  I have been shamed  by wanting to fuck  Todd Hargosh's mother  in the mouth  with their aspirations  such events  will continue  until that glorious  moment  on New Year's Day  2006  the day Howard Stern  makes his long  awaited  satellite radio debut  by the way  I believe that's a Sunday  or something  it's not a  silly goose  I think you'd have to wait  another day 
[02:11:30]  currently listening to  he says what he's  currently listening to  Radio Margaritaville  and Fred on XM  definitely not listening to  High Voltage  with your pals Opie and Anthony  thank god he's not listening  and most wanted  what is most wanted  Howard Stern's contract  with Viacom to end  sooner than 2006  exclamation point  right  I would have respected him  a little bit  if he just stated his agenda  right up front 
[02:12:00]  instead of coming off  like he's doing  this whole big  satellite expose  yeah  so again  what's his  gameindustry.com  reviews at  gameindustry.com  if you want to give  this guy  maybe you agree with him  so maybe you want to  give him some  positive feedback  and look at his pictures  because he's  a fucking tool  I was waiting for something  better  but that just works fine  dude it's mind boggling 
[02:12:30]  what an ass this guy is  his name irritates me  Todd Harbosh  that guy is a  what they call a  Juliet Delta  no?  I'm trying to  you didn't get that one?  no  wait  a what?  Juliet Delta  Juliet Delta  um  he's a  he's a  he likes to pick up  marshmallows  a jism dealer  oh  jizz drinker 
[02:13:00]  Jesus  wow  that deserves a real  that deserves a real  Carl careful  hey  look who it is  look who it is  it's Bill Carl  you get it?  I'm talking about  your house  Bravo Charlie  that's what they call you  right?  yeah sure  we're obviously  looking at Ben  yeah  alright we'll  we'll break  and we'll get into  the Gay Pride  audio next  how's that sound?

[02:15:00]  you're going to get what you deserve  now we sing it to you  yeah  sing oh  and guess it 
[02:15:30]  keeping you out of that one Jimmy  why what do you mean  you're bad for your business  what what what do you mean  what what happened  and we're back with the Opie and Anthony program  Gay Pride  had a little parade this weekend  here in New York City  so we sent a few of our young go-getters  to interview the fine people  that were checking out the parade  and marching in the parade  boy was it crowded this year too  I actually tried to meet the guys  but I couldn't even get across  7th Avenue  they must have a float  dedicated to you 
[02:16:00]  someone actually came up  with a more original  Ben's Hog line  Ben's Hog is so big  I'll find it for three  but I'll catch it  and kill it for ten  that's good  that's funny  that's funny  that's the Ed  from Merrick  that was crazy  out of all the years  because I happen to live  in the area where it ends  where it ends  that's gotta be great  we're not by a cemetery  that's very funny  the best is there's a place  where all the Red Sox fans 
[02:16:30]  congregate in that area  yeah  and so a lot of them  were coming in  oh that's a perfect place  to end the Gay Pride Parade  there's some real Boston fans  in front of the Red Sox nation  get out of here  you fucking faggots  there was a couple  all the gay guys  think the B stands for boys  can I have that hat  that was funny  funny stuff  but they  I couldn't  Travis and Danny  were across 7th Avenue  in front of the Duplex  which the Duplex  is one of the big places  that they  you know  oh the Duplex  yeah  what's that all about  it's a big complex 
[02:17:00]  you know  where the boys hang out  they had  they had a club  at noon  what is it  it's a club  but I like noon  the music was so loud  already at noon  and packed  oh yeah  Ben's just walking  and herky and jerky  like look at that dance  he's doing  it's called  it's called the dude dude  they were still out  this morning  at like 5.15  of course they were  the whole night  they make of it  god imagine how much  just ass sex 
[02:17:30]  was going on  last night  awful  oh wow  and you want  a guy  that's what you want  to float  a guy with a jockstrap  and leather chaps  we want to adopt  could you get gay people  in suits  and have them represent you  yeah  doesn't that really show  people that  they're responsible  adults  we're not too sympathetic  to your cause  when you're dressed like that  hey honey  there's a man in a dress  with a basket of fruit  on his head  I want him to have kids  and I'm for you guys  adopting  but Jesus  you gotta get better  representation  at the parade  you don't allow  all aspects 
[02:18:00]  and I'm sorry  there's some people  you gotta go look  just stay home this year  stay home this year  we're trying to make a point  I saw  I saw a picture  of a couple  of gay gentlemen  and their adopted  little boy  and it was just  it just looked  a little creepy  like they're holding  him and  and smiling  with each other  and the  and the kid  and  I don't know  just a little odd  I know people  grow up in  single families  and I know  married couples  have their problems 
[02:18:30]  and their kids  grow up all fucked up  and they fuck them up  and everything  but it's like  but the reality is  it just looks weird  it just looks  and for the kid  I'm sorry  when you're going  to school  and you have  two daddies  a lot of these  schools in New York  they cancel  Mother's Day now  because some kids  don't have a mommy  yeah  no mommy  no they  and Father's Day  they don't want to  upset some of these  and Father's Day  they have just  kind of a parent's day  oh  how nice  yeah and that's sweet  it's so inclusive  I love that  I love that  I love when we just  take what was 
[02:19:00]  traditional  and just throw it away  make way for  debauchery  instead of just saying  look your lifestyle  is alternative  alternative means  a little bit different  so there are times  where  not that it's going  to be awful  but I'm sorry  we have a traditional  thing that we do  you're the alternative  this is  now you've got to  suck it up  and deal with it  and have it on  Father's Day  well you'll have  twice a bigger party  or on Mother's Day  in your house  you'll have twice  a bigger party  why can't you  just celebrate  once a year  because of your  lifestyle choice  right  and Ben's saying  that Syria  has had a float too 
[02:19:30]  which is that true  yeah I didn't see that one  but yeah they have a float  over here  that's lovely  how wonderful  and there was a  Rent Boys float  a Rent Boys float  there's so many floats  and just  wow  the guys dancing  and guys in leather  whipping each other  whipping each other  in chaps  and leather  and cowboy hats  and you wonder why  society looks at you  as odd  I don't care what  you do sexually  but the straight community  has plenty of  deviants too  but you don't see  the Irish Day parade  people laying on the back  having logs dropped 
[02:20:00]  on their chest  because that's a segment  of the straight community  we keep it behind closed doors  we certainly do  that's what I'm talking about  but do you understand  you don't show  certain deviant aspects  of the straight community  because every community  has that  but for some reason  the gay community  they feel when they go out  and do these events  and parades  they have to really show  their deviant sexual side  and that's one thing  that as  responsible gay people  that want to adopt  and get rights  and health care 
[02:20:30]  and stuff  that's what they  are trying not  to portray themselves  that  it's all about  just shocking straighty  shock straighty  I just remember  there was a guy  in a gimp outfit  walking  on the ground  with another guy  on a leash  that's what you want  because any conservative  person is going to  look over and go  yes now I see  their point  so I'm going to  they do need health care  you're making yourself  punchlines  and by doing this  again  I'm not saying  that these people  shouldn't be allowed  to do this  but to give people  floats and to feature 
[02:21:00]  them like that  you've got to say  sometimes  look you're  I'm sorry  a little bit of  an odd part  of this community  and we love you  and you're a part of it  but we don't want you  at the parade  we're trying to get  marriage rights  and trying to convince  America  like look  you want to be yourself  but there are certain  things you have to  just kind of keep  to yourself  and it's not like  the old days  now there's some  serious issues out there  you make a great point  why can't gay people  just stress  I'm sorry to interrupt you  why can't they just  stress the fact  that we're in love  and we're just like  straight people  our love is the same  why does there have  to be the whole 
[02:21:30]  sexual aspect  when in like  the Columbus Day Parade  who I don't like  or the stupid  Puerto Rican Day Parade  at least they stress  the other cultural  things in their community  and not just a bunch  of guys in leather  getting their asses spanked  why is that a part  of your community  featured at the parade  when the Puerto Rican  Day Parade  they don't feature  people getting spanked  or getting blown  or being whipped  that's a part of  Puerto Rican Pride  or Irish Pride  or Irish Lifestyle  not Pride  we all have it  so we don't feature it  why are you  yeah  it's featured  prominently  they just 
[02:22:00]  it's all about  their sexual  preference  which kind of  is what it's all about  their sexual preference  is different  the guy-guy-girl-girl thing  so if they were  just marching  there really wouldn't be  what would be  their thing  we're gay  and we're in love  and this is who we are  like at  the St. Paddy's Day Parade  it's the guys  they're wearing the green  they're playing  the bagpipes  you suggest for the gay one  they play the bagpipes  and just maybe 
[02:22:30]  jerk what their mouth is on  as they're playing it  down the street  a little more subtle  everybody walks in robes  but no  you understand  I'm not saying  they shouldn't do it  I don't care  that they do it  but just don't complain  when most of America  looks at you  like your punchlines  don't complain  when that's when you go  this is gay pride  and here we are  and it's a bunch of guys  in short shorts  going  what do you expect  most of the country to do  look and go  yes  that's who we want  teaching our children  no no no  that guy with his ass exposed 
[02:23:00]  they're going to be horrified  or laugh hysterically  at you  and that's what  America's impression of you  is going to be  and this is in New York  but we don't care  I mean look  I could care less  believe me  I've said I'm for gay marriage  all that shit  but don't complain  when most of the country  looks at you  like you're jackasses  when you feature this  at the parade  and it's a sanctioned  by the gay community event  yeah  I don't care either way  we just got some great audio  from the parade  absolutely right  that's what I was getting at  I think they could  do whatever they want  I find it very entertaining  I laugh my ass off  looking at the news coverage 
[02:23:30]  and stuff  because again  the news people too  have to be politically correct  of course they can't comment  really how they want to  they talk about how  well this is quite a flamboyant display  here at the gay pride parade  let's talk to a couple of gentlemen here  that  hi how are you daddy  with that voice  that friggin tranny voice  and they're talking to him  and not saying  why are you wearing  a codpiece  and nothing else  and how is this 
[02:24:00]  going to help your cause  you should ask him  honest questions  alright right now  where is your father hiding  well let's go to the audio  we have a lot more to say here  but you gotta hear  some of this audio  let's hear it  and by the way  hi how are you  alright well how long  have you been writing  for gameindustry.com  you red haired pole smoker  oh  someone's saying  how did they get  Napoleon Dynamite  to write reviews for  I don't like opi  from a crack  are you guys having fun today 
[02:24:30]  nope  why not  I have a rash  where is he  don't worry  is it itch or is there a  itch just burns  his asshole burns  from too much man cock in it  is what he was getting to  very subtly  to be very subtle  why would the first thing  out of your mouth  besides the cock  be  I have a rash  I have a rash  with that gay guy voice  why  hey having a nice day 
[02:25:00]  yeah it's a lot of fun  out here  a lot of my friends  are here  what else are you  going to say  when someone  wanted to be here  watching from a window  somewhere  your little dog  having broth  let's go to the next  clip here  he couldn't keep  anything down today  can't make it  not a good day  wow  way to make it real  that bothered me  more on the rash guys 
[02:25:30]  more on the rash  like frosted flakes almost  but like in the milk  for too long  he was describing  all right  all right  what the fuck  dude  god  I should have set that up  here he is  describing his rash  like frosted flakes almost  but like in the milk  for too long  jesus  that just means  he was  pounded  pounded 
[02:26:00]  the night before  and probably  all morning long  and then he's marching  you know what it's like  when maybe you've taken  a dump  after you've eaten  something that binds  you up a little bit  or spicy food  you get a little  of that cranky ass  spicy food  and then  you maybe play  a little golf  or you're doing  something that involves  a lot of walking  that day  and you get what is  called cranky ass  sure  this guy  has  beyond  cranky ass  it's just  mega cranky ass  that's just  imagine taking 
[02:26:30]  a shit  that lasts  12 hours long  and it's going  in and out  and then you get up  and walk a parade  route  you seem bothered  Anthony  I am bothered  because this is  a little bothered  they're so god damn  what do you want  do you want  acceptance  and rights  and do you want  to be taken seriously  as an alternative  lifestyle  or do you want  people to go  this is why  they can't have  children 
[02:27:00]  they can't adopt  children  this is why  they're not getting  health care  because I'm not  paying for this  guy to get  a new asshole  to get an asshole  transplant  here we go  because he's  banging all  all night long  for something  he's getting an  asshole transplant  for something  tighter  like a sinkhole  couple of stitches  while you're down  there sweetie  with that  here's the next  clip  have you seen  the floats  yeah  we were watching  the parade earlier  the HX float  hot  I even saw  penis 
[02:27:30]  oh  that's a treat  for him  you got to see  penis  what is with the  voice  what is the voice  is that something  that's  because they talk  about being  homosexual  is it something  you're born with  or something  that you're  raised with  what's with the  voice  is that it  is that something  twined in their  DNA  or is that a  put on thing  that you do  as a gay person  to show that  you're gay  someone said  someone raised a point  once  to me it's like  it's a main  it's an impression  of feminine  is it  like trying to be a  girl  almost like 
[02:28:00]  someone once  said that  this would be a good  point  that gay people  don't have any  real role models  like growing up  so the people  you look at  and again this  was just explained  to me once  that the people  you look at  and emulate  are women  because that's  who you relate  to more  so you start  talking like  if there were  more out gay  people like  sports figures  or whatever  maybe over time  that would become  more varied  and maybe the people  they hang out with  all talk like that  I don't know  but they all have  this really weird  it's the same thing  it's all that  almost like a  slightly nasal thing  and very weird 
[02:28:30]  and what the fuck  I know  I hate a funny voice  hey Liddy  Liddy  alright let's  move on  faggot  let's move on  you're not a faggot  you can't put a  dick in my lid  here we go  what was your  favorite part  of the parade  today  drinking  the fags  say that again  the fags  for everything  this is a gay  pride parade  that's disgusting  there you go  a little irony  there  making a little 
[02:29:00]  sarcastic  here's a guy  describing what  he likes about  men  so you are  having a good  time today  yes I am  what's your  favorite part  of the parade  so far  the men  the hard bodies  the nice  suckable kissable lips  hard dick  oh yeah  and the nice  flaming balls  that's also what  people love about  our own Ben  Ben Sparks  the messy hair  the dark  welder glasses  the huge hog

[02:30:00]  I have left  he goes  that's not funny  I tell Ben  I like Ben  because he dressed  like social studies  teacher  with a checkered  short sleeve shirt  that's why I like Ben  and he said dude  and tell same story  30 times in a row  alright  we got more clips  here  great  they're getting  better and better  listen to this one  who's the best  you ever had  my first cousin  alright so you

[02:31:30]  Jiminy Cricket  hands at his sides  mouth first  right into that  pool of dick  that's it  here's that same guy  explaining why he  effed his first cousin  alright  and you don't feel weird  about telling people  that it was your first cousin  no I don't  you don't find that a little  uh... strange  well  shit happens  on your dick  shit happens  shit happens  all over my yam bag  walking to the bathroom  it certainly happens 
[02:32:00]  you're expecting for  Willy Wonka to come by  in that little boat  well that's Danny's audio  from the Gay Pride Parade  that's good stuff  a little uh  young go-getter  competition is  happening right now  now we have  Travis's audio  ah  this is nice  two different takes  from the Gay Pride  on the same subject  skinny as Travis  they probably thought  he was the Parade Marshal  that little  that little swimmer's build  with his glasses  he looks like an activist 
[02:32:30]  we loved it  Jesus  here we go  here's Travis  at the Gay Pride Parade  you enjoy yourself  uh  yesterday  it was wonderful  he's even got that beard going  Jesus  he just  guy can grow a beard  sure can  grizzly adams  little skinny grizzly adams beard  my lord  I am La Libertine  I am  okay  this needs to be set up  he certainly does  this guy is describing  his super gay outfit  Travis Wright  super gay outfit  what would that look like  well he's gonna tell 
[02:33:00]  oh okay  I am La Libertine  I am the French Corps  who you have sold  to your corporate greed  what made you  dress up like this  well it's a carryover  of a Lady Liberty outfit  I've been doing for a while  it's kind of like  political drag  and so it's  just hot  so therefore  what I'm wearing  is a very low cuts  orange speedo  with a Lady Liberty  crown  gold boots  and  a yellow cape  and uh  what school would you like  to teach at sir  yeah 
[02:33:30]  no different than us  no different than straight people  give us your tired  poor  huddled masses  and I'll suck their cock  who was that  someone that  wanted in on the program  what happened to them  I don't know  where'd they go  I don't know  Hawk go get them  more Travis audio  it's a communal gathering  and for people  I guess his needs  to be described  a little set up  what the parade is about  for him  it's a communal gathering  and for people 
[02:34:00]  to witness each other  in a big public way  there is something valuable  when large numbers  of people gather together  and just by the sheer numbers  it empowers people  in their own actualization  and acceptance  of their sexuality  sure does  Germany 1945  that's right  large groupings of people  are always good  as long as it's a large group  together for any cause  it's good  that works  what do you mean  their actualization  to actualize it  oh okay 
[02:34:30]  let's go to Sal  Sal what's up  hi boys  how are you  hi Sal  Jimmy I have a bit of a  problem with your  dishonesty today  on the show  essentially you're saying  that the people  who go to these  gay pride parades  are the flamboyant ones  and they're the ones  that come out  which I don't dispute  okay I'm not even  knocking  can I just finish a thought  I know that's the way  you work  but let me finish  I'm letting you finish  I was talking with you  I understand  but I wasn't done  with my point  that's how you have  a conversation  well sorry stupid  I can't see you  I'm just listening to you  okay stupid  wait till I'm done talking 
[02:35:00]  and that's when you talk  go ahead sir  thank you  shut up  so all the people  going out to the  gay pride parades  are flamboyant  understandably so  no some are flamboyant  not all  alright fine  but then you're saying  that they shouldn't  be afforded the rights  based on the fact  of the people  who go to the parade  no  no  wrong  no  that's not  what I'm saying  okay so what  were you saying then  I am saying  I even said  Jesus  this is why  I can't stand people  no one listens  dude I even said 
[02:35:30]  I am all for gay marriage  I am all for gay adoption  and I've said that  many times  what I said about  this situation  is that when you  showcase that  as part of the  and I know it's a part  of the community  straight people have that  I'm not saying that  it shouldn't be allowed  it shouldn't be legal  but when you look at  the rest of America  it's hard to say  yes  we think that  this is a fit for adoption  couple of human beings  or this is a fit to teach  my kids couple of human beings  or fit to be a scoutmaster  when the parade is featuring  sexualizing things like 
[02:36:00]  you understand  it undermines  it undermines all the work  that is done  to try to show  that it is just  an alternative lifestyle  and you should be afforded  these rights  and everything  and it completely undermines  all that work  because the rest of the country  looks and goes  fuck these faggots  they shouldn't be  given what they want  because look at them  they're freaks  I like prostitutes  I'm a pervert  but they don't feature me  in the Irish parade  with a hooker  or a dominatrix  you know what I'm saying  it just seems you guys  need better leadership 
[02:36:30]  because once a year  the spotlight is on  the whole community  and this is what  you're showing everybody  I understand  but isn't it respected  that that's just a portion  of that community  it's not the community at wise  is America going to look at that  and go  wow we don't want to  fuck those quote unquote  faggots  they are  hold on  don't shoot us  because we're telling you  the way people look at it  I see it that way  but you're talking about  a lot of people looking in  that will not decipher that  this is their only  this is the only time  they're watching  you know watching people 
[02:37:00]  being gay let's say  and it's not looking  it's not looking good  but who are we talking about  if you're talking about  the people on let's say  the right or left coast  who are more open minded  they can know the difference  if you're talking about  people in the midwest  well you're never going to  change  you're talking about  the majority of the country  my friend  you're talking about  the majority of this country  the majority of this country  are bible thumpers  and you're not going to  change your mindset  no matter who you put out there  so it's a losing battle  but a lot of  that's not necessarily true man  that's not necessarily true  so stand there  online dressed in 
[02:37:30]  a big line on the road  dressed in chaps  and nothing else  whipping each other's asses  and that'll help  I'm not saying  it's an accurate  showing of the community  so how am I being a hypocrite  it shouldn't be discounted  in any way  based on who you put  in a parade  how am I being  a hypocrite  let me ask you a question  is my example  not correct about  straight parades  or like say Irish parades  or whatever  not showing a certain  element of their community  not that again  they should be executed  but there's certain things  that you know  go on in your community  or whatever  which should be allowed 
[02:38:00]  but you don't showcase  them at the parade  that your community  is sanctioning  I mean  is there not an element  of the straight  community that's not  showcased at the parades  look  what I'm saying  I'm asking you  I'm not  I'm asking  I don't understand  your question  ask it again  I don't understand  what you're asking  is  is there not an element  of the straight community  okay  that is not showcased  at their parade  meaning a very sexual aspect  and I raise myself  as an example  liking hookers  and all that stuff  that's a very big part  of the straight community  which is of course  kept quiet  they don't showcase  that at the parade  no 
[02:38:30]  so what I'm saying  is why does the gay community  have to showcase  every single element  of their community  and at the same time  complain that America  looks at them  like they're oddballs  I hate the fact  that I see your point  and you said  I was being a hypocrite  I wasn't trashing  the gay community  I don't care  that that element exists  I don't say  it shouldn't exist  and I'm not saying  that they wouldn't be  good parents  just because they're flamboyant  but when you showcase that  and you say  this is who we are  but are they really  saying that though  are they putting  those people out there 
[02:39:00]  and saying  this is who we are  this is all that we do  gay pride  it's the gay pride parade  of course  it's showcasing  who you are  so by that theory  then the Puerto Rican Day  parade is going to be  all rowdy Spanish folks  that's all that they are  no no no no  what I'm saying is though  there is an element  to the Puerto Rican community  which exists in the  Italian community  the Irish community  the black community  which is not showcased  at the parade  and again  it's not that you  shoot the people  who behave like that  but it's not  the sexual aspect  of the Puerto Rican  community 
[02:39:30]  is not showcased  at that parade  I mean yeah  there's people  that walk around  in the stereotypical  little teeny spandex shorts  and you get that  in every group  there's drunk Irish people  but you don't have  a float  of the stereotype  of drunk Irish people  they understand  that that exists  but you don't have  that float  you don't have  that celebrated  it's not crucified  but you don't have  to celebrate it  because you're showing  trying to show the country  the more positive  side of your community  I see  okay  understandably so  let me just go on  to one more thing  if I may  your whole Gene Simmons  thing kind of got  to me a little bit too 
[02:40:00]  the way you trashed  that guy in the air  and then when you meet him  you're hugging him  I'm not sure I understand  a lot of this  Jimmy's a little phony  dude I'm a phony  I admit it  I'm a starved idiot  I admit that  we pointed that out  on many occasions  and I admit that  he's not getting away  with anything  he even admitted today  like yeah  and I kind of backed down  I might have said  something on the radio  he downplayed it  why because  it's part of who he is  from a guy who  who demands honesty  out of anyone who speaks  where is the honesty  when it comes to you  and that  dude the honesty  isn't about the fact  that I'm human  and I'm inconsistent 
[02:40:30]  and I've said this  I'm explaining  you're asking me  I'm explaining  alright  Colin Quinn said  about comedy  I just quote this  because it's one of  my favorite quotes  is one of the things  about the comics  on Tough Crowd  that he liked  is that we are  pointing out people's  hypocrisies  and all the awful  things in society  and we're still honest  enough to admit  that we're as guilty  as anybody in the game  I know I can be  hypocritical sometimes  I know my reactions  are emotional  and they're not always  correct  I mean I try to be  honest in the reactions  they're not always  correct  and Gene Simmons  for me  he was a boyhood idol  dude  my reaction was  so angry  because I was hurt  he was a childhood idol 
[02:41:00]  from the age of 7  and the guy just  shot me down  and it just blew me apart  maybe it's corny  and faggy  but it was unpleasant  understandable reaction  I just figured  if you're going to be  going with that reaction  stay true to it  all the way to the end  that's what I thought  that's impossible  I admit that part of myself  I admit that I love  Gene Simmons  and I admit like  I've even said on the air  like I'm kind of over it  and he's still Gene Simmons  and if I see him at  Babe Fest  I'll try to talk to him  I admit that  I brought pictures for him  to sign  and I immediately  threw myself under the bus  and said yes  I talked to him backstage  and weaseled out of it 
[02:41:30]  okay  but is it fair to say  you're a hypocrite  who points out hypocrisy  yes  as it is fair to say  that about any hypocrite  or anyone who points out  hypocrisy  or any human being  totally understandably so  but you're on a national radio show  screaming about honesty  from people  when in turn  you are not always honest  with people  and your feelings  will vary depending  on where you are  so of course  no one out there  is completely honest  no one  and everyone  listening to this program  has some hypocrisy  to them  no one is completely honest  everyone is a hypocrite  of course not  dude  who said that 
[02:42:00]  I never said that  when you're on the air  screaming about people  who bad mouth  and you go  oh why don't you  just be honest  about your intentions  well  I am honest  about my intentions  well dude  I'm honest  about my intentions  I am honest  about that stuff  I'm not coming  from one direction  and hiding behind  what direction  I'm coming from  are you sure Jim  because you bad mouth Gene  and then when you see him  you hide behind that  and say he's a superstar  hide behind what  I thought he was a superstar  you say one thing  dude the bottom line  is this  you have a problem  with me  you're trying to catch  honestly Jimmy  I don't think you're  no I don't think  he has a problem  you still thought  he was a superstar 
[02:42:30]  even when he was bashing  it's not delusional  even when I bashed him  I admitted I had been  a lifelong fan  and it was hurtful  when he shot me down  I admitted that it was hurtful  I wasn't coming from  this tough guy point of view  it hurt  okay  so you know  you react hurt  but after that  maybe you didn't hear  the shows after that  you know it goes away  the anger goes away  you calm down  after a while  you know of course  you do dude  and it wasn't like  I knew what it was  I knew I reacted  overreacted  because I was hurt  it was just a celebrity  walking away  I knew it  time heals everything  yes  unless you're wearing a robe  and then  fair enough  back to the AIDS  and horror jokes 
[02:43:00]  you guys  thanks for taking my call  alright Sal  bye bye  alright  why can't you guys  find common ground  in the fact that  you both had dicks  in your mouth  good point Ed  you very early on  and him  what time is it  Ed in Alabama  what's up Ed  hi how you doing guys  hi Ed  big daddy  how you doing  hi Ed  hey I'm from  I'm from Alabama  you know  I'm no bible thumper  no but you're a very  tolerant state  to the gays  down there in Alabama  yes we are 
[02:43:30]  very tolerant  that's right  I think you're  ground zero  for gay bashing  they really are  you're the worst  they're the fucking  carpool  of the karachi  of anti-gay sentiment  but I don't have  I don't have a problem  with the gays  and I don't  but I'm the same way  when you see this  I mean come on now  it's a little bit  ridiculous  get out there  please  like yeah  we're gonna jump up  and say yeah  let them get married  fuck that  I think there's a big part 
[02:44:00]  of society  that's on the fence  or in the grey area  they're not really sure  what to think about  the gay community  and then you spot like this  ah I got my decision made  I do think a lot of people  look at gay people  and as much as they don't like it  I mean we have progressed  as a society  and people realize  look man  I mean they have to be  afforded the same rights  they are tax paying  individuals  who should have the same  property rights  and health benefit rights  as we do  and again like Hope said  on the fence man  and then it's like  that kind of teeters them  in the other direction  it's not like a white  there's a lot of people  they're just not sure  and they're still making 
[02:44:30]  their decision I guess  just because they're  bible thumpers dude  who irritate me  it doesn't mean that  you can never reach them  because a lot of that crap  believe me  look at the church scandal  that really hurt the church  a lot of bible thumpers  stuck with them  and a lot of them  walked away  and said this is a disgrace  I mean  it's not like it was  50 years ago  and also you know  there's some  people out there  that might be  future politicians  and they're still trying  to make their decision  early on in their lives  you know  he made it sound  like it's black and white  that salad guy  saying you either  love us or hate us  but he's saying  there's a lot of people  who are still trying 
[02:45:00]  to figure it out  yeah  and these people  might be making  some decisions  for the gay community  eventually  you never know  let's go to  Matt in Indiana  Matt  Matt  probably lying  in front of  someone's door  well I think  this guy was going  to try to do  the same thing  that Matt  was attempting  New Orleans  what's up  hey  boys  Jimmy  hey buddy  hey we got  Essence Festival  down here next week  it's kind of like  a black gathering  but like you said  with showcasing  you don't see them 
[02:45:30]  running around  with fried chicken  and watermelons  punching out  Jesus dude  alright  well I'm a black  you know you want to  say like black parades  don't feature the bad  element of the black community  negative stereotypes  yeah you just don't do it  it's what that whole  the gay pride parade  shows negative  stereotypes  of gay people  where if you  were as a straight guy  to make jokes  about what you saw  at the gay pride parade  you would be accused  of spreading  negative stereotypes  and being homophobic  yes  meanwhile you're just  saying what you saw 
[02:46:00]  them doing  at the parade  bunch of guys  and leather chaps  spanking each other  excuse me  we're a lot more  than that  how about the news clips  I just saw  two minutes ago  just looking at the float  yeah  exactly  we got a couple more  clips from Travis  let's go to the next one  here  this guy talks about  how he accepted  his gi  well it was basically  on one level  just acceptance  of my desire  or something I had known  but was denied beforehand  what makes you know 
[02:46:30]  is like what feels right  and what is natural  to where your desire  leads you  YMCA blasting  in the background  you notice that  could it be  any more stereotypical  one of the top gay classics  of all time  by the way  it is  we're counting down  the top gay classics  all weekend long  WFAJ  see that's why  commercial radio  is boring  it's the same shit  block party weekends  and all that  why don't you just  as a goof  do the top  gay classics 
[02:47:00]  of all time  it's raining man  because that would  be a little too creative  and you can do it  in a way  where you're not  you know  you're just doing it  it's being silly  it's being silly  we're celebrating  diversity  it's rating men  coming in  at the 8th position  there's really  a list of  top 100  gay classics  is there  I don't want  to give it away  but I bet  the number one  was written  by Springsteen  Jesus 
[02:47:30]  oh okay  I'm a little slow  today  Jesus  that's very funny  alright here's one more  clip from Travis  how he knew he was gay  nah  well I had been  having sex with men  before I admitted  I was gay  and I wasn't having  sex with women  at all  and so  you know  there's all of a sudden  this wake up moment  and it was also 
[02:48:00]  in the context  of a friendship  slash relationship  that started up  with another man  so he brought me out  by me obviously  admitting  that I was attracted  to him  or there was  something going on  between us  if you're having  sex with guys  you pretty much  admitted that you're  gay right there  yeah what tipped you  off sir  was it the hand  holding and making  out with your friend  yeah he's like  work on his  perception skills  you know I didn't  admit I was gay  I was having  sex with men 
[02:48:30]  and not having  sex with women  but I don't admit it  I was in love  with my analyst  like Montgomery  from fame  and then I finally  realized  well I was in  a tree fort  and he was going  jeep jeep jeep jeep  Hal was asleep  we got Derek  from Texas  you're a black guy  that loves the show  Derek  yes  how y'all doing  hi Derek  and we got Chad  from Chelsea  on the other line  who's a gay guy  that loves the show  ah  hey guys  hi it's Chad  from Chelsea  how are you  Jimmy I love you

[02:53:30]  and old ladies  like with these  signs that said  we are proud  of our gay son  you know  and so I was saying  that's an odd thing  to be proud of  you know  because it's not  an achievement  you know  it's not like  something you  work all your life  to be gay  or anything like that  and I just wondered  I just  I had a hard time  believing that  these 50-60 year old men  are actually bragging  you know  at work like that  hey Bill  you know  my kid  oh my god  we're proud of him  Johnny  he graduated  from Harvard  you know

[02:57:00]  I want to give a big F.U. at the Donkey Sausage or P.R. Beauty 1 from Rock Bag for not being able to fucking say cursing and trying to leave an F.U. saying curse-ling.  I want to give a big F.U. to Sodom. The only way he'll get off is if the trial is held in L.A. County. 
[02:57:30]  I want to give a big F.U. to my next-door neighbor, you crybaby piece of shit.  My only wish is to come home from work and to see the coroner bringing out a black bag.  Fuck you, Howard, you copycat motherfucker.  I'd like to say a big F.U. to Jim Brewer.

[02:59:30]  psychiatry and medications we got teen boob jobs on 2020 that was on 2020 the  teen boob jobs yeah we got a station in Philly that came up with a great new  idea called the assault on the media why this is this is why you know you know  what in a way no you know when you talk about honestly when Howard talks about  these you know people ripping off bits and shit this happens all the fucking  time in radio somebody comes up with an idea in these lazy fucks all over the 
[03:00:00]  country just jump on it Eric Logan told me he goes now that you guys got that you  know national attention for the assault on the media he goes you watch it's gonna  be the biggest bit this summer everybody's gonna do it in their local  market that's right and then what happens is you know enough people start doing it  then people forget who actually came up with it  where that's what's really frustrating as a as a radio host yeah so I guess  there's a station doing it in Philly I don't even want to give them the time of  day but just to mention that they're doing it tell them Fred I know you go down 
[03:00:30]  the road ripping me off I was asking people to tie bandanas around reporters  that's right tell them Fred I've done it all I've done it all salt on the media I'm the  king of all media you use media in a promo you're ripping me off  whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo  shut up  dude what are you trying to do you trying to get Todd Harbosh  all angry on us again I know I know

[03:02:30]  after begun shouldn't be a period it should be a semicolon semicolon thank you where's that you're right  have begun have begun semicolon periods take care of all that shit though sometimes maybe a dash  perhaps a dash i like to do dot dot dot because the thought continues yeah but you can't use dot dot dot  in the middle of a sentence i do all the time why would a semicolon go after begun  because your assault on the um on the media copycats has begun i don't know an english major would  probably know how to explain this better um but it's just the beginning of a thought and that's 
[03:03:00]  the following thought um it just would be i mean anyone who knows english better than i do which is  probably most of you please call in have begun all right here we go teen boob jobs on 2020 anthony  you don't want to deal with me on the english one and no no i i wouldn't even try i wasn't even going to  try believe me i am the worst i am retarded when it comes to english spelling i'm the worst i am  awful no i get annoyed like like i'm a frustrated third grader like i'm home trying to type something 
[03:03:30]  and i'm like i have no idea how to spell this i get all angry and i have to put it in yahoo so the  right one pops up and isn't that creepy if anthony had to write down his smartness it would look really  dumb oh he doesn't claim to be a pundit i mean you don't claim to be a pundit no but you just shut  up but how he articulates is is dare i say brilliant at times oh thank you those same same thoughts on  paper it would look like a third grade writing he's a great i'm not even kidding i i've known that for  years with bell worth a shit anthony is a genius uh or as he would spell it g-e-n-u-s i have no idea 
[03:04:00]  how to spell genius g be honest hold on let me spell it because this is one of anthony's downfalls  one of his little things i know there's see it's not like oh my god he's struggling with it  genius are you being honest no come on you know how to spell genius no i don't that's one of those  words that i always can't spell you know how to spell dumbbell how did how did you spell it there  g-e-n-i-u-s perfect there you go and there an o in there 
[03:04:30]  genius no it's only in genie geniosity  i am retarded when it comes to spelling i can't spell and i've been that way  my whole life and i it never fixes i can't learn like how to spell it's just it's the same words  too every goddamn time the same words come up that i'm typing i'm like oh well gotta find another word  for that how about received uh yeah uh that's the i before e thing though yeah but that one's 
[03:05:00]  different right that one's r-e-c-i-e-v-e-d or is it e i i don't know that one always messes me up  too i think it i i before e except after c oh no i before e except except after c right yeah but i think  that's different because be believed yeah but that yeah and then received c e i why do they make 
[03:05:30]  those rules they're just i before e except after c thank you jim i said cuddles i was just like  cuddle monsters and i cut the thought but there are some times where it's not i know and then they  say something else yeah and then there's another little rhymey thing that'll make i owe you feel  stupid sometimes before c sometimes all right here we go before c  here we go sometimes boobs boobs teen boobs  god teen makes everything sound hotter we teen boobs we came up with this observation years ago 
[03:06:00]  uh years ago excuse me boob jobs boob jobs yeah sounds very hot teen boob jobs so much hotter  so hot they can't wait to be hot is what it is this is uh the latest uh craze they're not filling out  the prom dress uh prom's coming up they realize that they're not going to look as nice so they go  and have breast augmentation surgery have some implants put in that's the latest craze it's you 
[03:06:30]  know instead of getting i don't know a little money or something for graduation you get uh you get  plastic surgery is a big thing with the ladies now before they even enter college they're getting the  boob jobs the lipo the nose is done yeah what i don't understand with like i'm all for this by the  teen boob jobs i think you gotta wait for your body to completely develop before you figure out  what's wrong with it yeah i don't think they're 13 having this done are they they're like seniors in  high school so they're 17 yeah you're all grown by then 18 yeah got your tits by then what if you  don't a few ladies need to call and tell us uh that they developed a little later than 17 17 that's 
[03:07:00]  what i'm thinking and so when you get the you get the nice boob job and then all of a sudden your body  decides no no i had some growth left in me and you got to think the boobs start looking a little  weird no i i think by 17 it's kind of like when you chicks have their tits it's kind of like when  you blow up uh something a little too much and then it starts popping on the sides and stuff yeah  that's what i'm thinking might happen with these uh teen boob jobs i'd say by 17 girls pretty much  have the tits they're going to spend the rest of their life you're not a woman let me get some 
[03:07:30]  callers here to see what the i am not a woman indeed you are correct wow  what jimmy if he's you know i'll tell you one thing hopeless and you can't see his face yeah i  know you would question you would question or not teenager so johnson your old body john stossel  did his investigative it was john stossel john stossel still still showing concern uh over dumb  things yeah good still knowing that if you put teen in the title of his story of course it's going  to get ratings of course he doesn't he doesn't give a shit about teenage daughters what's the angle

[03:17:00]  she pads her bra i just buy these but i am an a like i wear like two bras thick shirts like i  lay her all the time because i feel so little yeah oh my goodness she envies lulu's new look  look how much confidence she has like she's like look at my shirt and look at her shirt like you  know she has a scarf to cover you know what i'm saying like i want her confidence a teenager named lulu 
[03:17:30]  with big fake tits oh boy that's not an aruba trip waiting to happen the pole she will just be  swinging around the pole how about lulu new tits this is truly the best tape i've ever seen heard  whatever how about having parents that teach you to accept your body and telling you that little  small breasts are perfectly sexy which they are and perfectly unless you're fat if you're fat you  have small tits shoot yourself in the head called those flat so rosie o'donnell is a flat so just put 
[03:18:00]  pump a bullet into your own cheekbone because you're worthless nothing to offer but if you're  a slender svelte girl and you have small bosoms it's perfectly simple you hide the fat gut underneath  some covers you could always get the tf in they got the big cans hey we got audio so flat so we got audio  we got audio of the same girl after her boob job i guess really she'd like the confidence and now  let's see how she uh... sounds six months later here's the new jennifer she says her new breasts  have changed her whole life changed her personality i am a loving and caring person and i'm outgoing but 
[03:18:30]  the way i used to dress and my body language didn't say that and now it does because of boobs yes but  and has this changed your life yes can't keep the come out of my cleavage i feel like a different person  i have so much confidence i like  do and say as i want like i don't hold anything back anymore 
[03:19:00]  well this girl's got problems and my stepfather's finally tucking me in again  that's nice i finally gave her the ability to speak that's lovely i guess guys now listen now guys  are just pretending to listen to you instead of looking at your chest going  fuck off almost a guy now men are just pretending that you're interesting you idiot  yeah really it's all a farce almighty i now say what i feel here's uh the girl's mom i think every  parent gives their kids gifts every day this is a gift of love from us and we see a difference to 
[03:19:30]  every guy she's with what did it cost you a lot a lot wow but i don't think you can put really a  price on your child's happiness but the price of her child's implants was about seven thousand dollars  jesus what awful fucking parents stop being their friend unless your kid has a medical problem where  you know there's something wrong with the breast you know it has do you have to get like a breast 
[03:20:00]  kind of if then it's different but i kind of get the self-confidence thing but not when they're  still like teenagers in high school you get a little older and it's something that has bothered  your whole life and i'm all for it go for it have fun but at that age how about teaching them self  respect and and something like that you idiot you try to that's a parish is trying to be young and  hip and communicate with their kid man be a pal to their kid yeah my parents were never my friends growing  up they're not even my friend now they need money i'm charging interest some uh how about a car crash 
[03:20:30]  on that one oh thank you i kind of liked it actually thank you that was the mother you could have  indicated by doing something that resembled a smile well sometimes you let the listeners smile in their  cars that's what it's about in the end you don't want to hog all the smiles it's not about me smiling  douchebag it's about the listener enjoying your little but it's about you because i see you guys but  when i when i do something like that it doesn't get a laugh oh i get sad in my heart 
[03:21:00]  i love that that was the mother yeah because we have a clip from the father now  she was the greatest piece of ass i've ever had and i've had him all over the world  and a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous  let's see we have another clip another girl before up uh before her operation anthony 
[03:21:30]  now 19 year old katherine hootrids wants them to hood or what having this done today yeah right  after this interview nervous um a little you know i'm nervous of the pain afterward just like any  human i think would be but i'm more excited you know it's like i said it's something that i've wanted  and today i get to have it i don't get it do you think maybe you have a body image problem because you look  fine um you know if i didn't get them and i was in the circumstances where i couldn't afford them or 
[03:22:00]  it just wasn't possible i would be fine with my body but why i can afford it because it's her  parents who are writing the check do you think her breasts are too small i think she looks fine the  way she is that's convincing it's not my choice and it's something that'll make her happy and  if it makes her happy i'm happy for her hello cutie pie yeah 19 breast implants 
[03:22:30]  the fda says about 40 of augmentation patients have at least one serious complication within three  years well then i had one to three years of my life where i felt great about myself and you can't  take that back you're going to have to probably have another operation that adds to the risks  doesn't scare me doesn't scare you a bit not at all 
[03:23:00]  size 14  one last clip here it's it's something it's so hard to explain how  something so materialistic and stupid can just make someone feel so much better about themselves  materialistic and stupid sounds right but it's what i wanted 
[03:23:30]  these are kind of chunky and big and it's something that's going to make me happy and i don't have any  regrets at all whatever it's when they start talking jesus christ  shut up daddy's big disappointment yeah the father where was the father  they're in eclipse from dear old dad you're not talking to the father you know that was the mother  just going she wants them she's getting i'm not paying for a fucking tits  she wants a machine you know there's a big argument and the mother goes don't worry you'll get me 
[03:24:00]  the father doesn't want that what father in his right mind wants to  exactly send his daughter to college with brand new huge tits  the father wants to duct tape them down before she leaves the house it might have been just the  opposite the mother might have said she really doesn't need them yes she does she does you see  her by the pool the other day how am i supposed to jerk off from the kitchen window looking at that  horrible yeah listeners are checking in no jimmy we weren't smiling either
