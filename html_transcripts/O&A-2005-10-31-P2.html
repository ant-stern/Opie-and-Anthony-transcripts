<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, engaging in their characteristically vulgar and aggressive banter, insulting each other and their staff (Ben and Steve).  They ridiculed Infinity Broadcasting's rebranding to "Free FM," particularly the choice of David Lee Roth and Adam Carolla as hosts.  The conversation then shifted to their recent vacation, listener complaints about their absence, and their perceived superiority to other entertainers.  They discussed their upcoming Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe, to be broadcast on a different channel by Ron and Fez, and lamented the poor quality of a *Daily News* advertisement for the event.  A listener call segment followed, featuring several calls deemed unfunny by the hosts.  Jim Norton's recent HBO special was discussed, focusing on a moment where he awkwardly bowed, prompting further insults between Opie and Norton.  They continued discussing the Halloween party and a news story about a pastor electrocuted during a baptism, which they categorized as a "Sucks to be you" story.  They mentioned Whackbag.com and opiananthony.com. The show briefly touched on Stalker Patty's appearance on *Maury Povich*.  Plans to post the video of Norton's awkward bow online were also made.

The next segment opened with a news story about a 15-year-old shooting a 31-year-old man who had chased them after they egged his minivan.  Callers and hosts discussed the incident, with varying reactions.  The conversation moved to childhood pranks, including snowball fights and egging cars. A Florida caller recounted a Halloween suicide mistaken for a decoration.  Other callers shared Halloween safety concerns, relating stories of trick-or-treating incidents and urban legends.  The "Assault on the Media" contest was discussed, focusing on "No Filter Paul's" antics and a misrepresentation of the contest in a news article.  Stephen Lynch's "Halloween Song" was played, and the "O&A Party Rock" was advertised. Further discussion centered on their Halloween party, the contest winner announcement, and a humorous interaction with a silent caller, "Mad Mexican."  Finally, a news report about Westchester County's curfew for sex offenders on Halloween was discussed, provoking further comedic commentary.

A caller, Mike from Michigan, discussed his friend, a registered sex offender who had sex with a 12-year-old when he was 16, leading to a vulgar and crude conversation about the legality and implications. Mad Max from XM radio called in, expressing discomfort with the previous discussion.  Jim Norton recounted a negative experience with Ron and Fez, describing how they insulted him after an interview, prompting him to confront them.  This discussion included highly offensive racial slurs and stereotypes. Norton discussed his HBO special, joking about weight gain and pressure to perform certain jokes.  An audio clip of Mad Mexican's radio show intro was played.  The conversation veered into disturbing pornography, specifically German and Japanese productions involving animal abuse and non-consensual acts, with misogynistic remarks from the hosts.  A caller whose wife was upset by a previous segment called in.  They discussed music for a bestiality video, and Jim Norton detailed a horrific trip to Grand Cayman involving severe illness and repeated vomiting, with Kenny, a friend who helped him travel, providing further details.  Norton also mentioned his back waxing.

A significant portion of the show focused on Sidecar's violent bout of vomiting on a flight to Florida due to olive consumption and Opie's scuba diving trip with his girlfriend, which involved her entanglement in coral and a near-fatal rescue.  Opie described the reckless behavior of their dive guide.  A clip from *Maury Povich* featuring "Stalker Patty," a 50-year-old virgin receiving a makeover, was shown, along with crude commentary from the hosts.  Richard Simmons's Sirius Satellite radio show and a phone call with Anthony's uncle, who recounted growing marijuana, were also included.  The hosts discussed their inclusion in the credits of *Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories*.

The final segment focused on the upcoming Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe, with a large crowd outside the studio.  Big A was in studio, and the hosts showed pictures of him from his younger years, making crude jokes.  They repeatedly mentioned Stalker Patty's appearance on *Maury Povich*.  Several phone calls, including one from "Lady Di," were briefly addressed. The hosts frequently referred to the remaining time, showcasing the rush to finish before the show ended.  The final moments were spent anxiously awaiting Patty's appearance on Maury, which did not happen before the broadcast ended.  The show concluded with sexually suggestive language promoting the Halloween party.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Shut the fuck up. 
[00:03:30]  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're a despicable ass.  And these dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh.  What are you people? 
[00:04:30]  I'm dope.  Hey, bud.  What's your problem?  You dick.  Hey, bud.  Let's party.  Oh, those guys are fast.  This is great, I see.  Where'd you get that?  Out of the hamper?  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays.  I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still tapping.  That's right.  That's right. 
[00:05:00]  That was your vacation.  It was really good, bro.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  This is not free FM.  Free FM.  Free FM blows.  Go fuck yourself, infinity broadcasting.  Call it whatever you like.  It's going to stink on ice.  What the hell do you get for free that actually is worth it in this life? 
[00:05:30]  It's typical radio, though.  You change the name and people expect something and you're going to get the same thing.  Free.  As opposed to what?  Something you have to pay for?  Is that what they're saying?  Has satellite radio made such an impact on these people that they now have to change names of all their stations and call it free FM?  Of course it's free.  Look at what you're getting.  How many commercials can they jam down your throat?  How many bullshit pseudo talent can they try to feed you? 
[00:06:00]  Good luck to you, free FM.  Free FM.  We're scared.  Let my FM go.  Free FM.  Damn you.  Freedom.  That's what you're going to get.  From what?  Shut up.  We are free.  I will rain down upon me a storm of commercials that will never end. 
[00:06:30]  Stupid commercial radio.  They had a year to try to figure it all out and the best they can come up with is,  well, we're scared shitless of satellite radio, so we'll call our whole company Free FM.  Free.  Free with a hacky talk show host that no one gives a shit about.  When they announce the lineup and I hear it, I picture playing in the background because it's just, it's got to be a joke.  It's got awful.  What do they got over there?  David Lee Roth, I guess, is the one that's taken over. 
[00:07:00]  Howie.  Yeah, David Lee Roth, who's going to do a political talk show, basically.  By himself, right?  Yeah, he's going to just do the show by himself.  That fucking egomaniac, he's going to be done within a year.  It was so difficult to listen to him just as a guest on other people's programs.  He's going to carry the show?  I love the celebrities that decide, you know, I'll take a radio gig for a while.  Yeah, this radio thing seems easy.  That's easy.  I was a guest on a show once.  I had a mic in front of me.  And I talked, and people seemed to enjoy it. 
[00:07:30]  So I'm going to make it my job.  Really?  And then they sit there and realize, hmm, this isn't as easy as...  No, this is the worst job in entertainment.  It's actually entertainment?  We're in the entertainment field, and this is the worst job you could possibly get.  Yeah.  Every fucking day, four hours of original content.  Oh.  And these stupid celebrities who, what, they have to maybe do a movie every once in a while  or write an album every five years. 
[00:08:00]  They were on set for, I believe, four months.  Right.  And it was very difficult to work.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they hang out getting pictures taken of them by the paparazzi for the other 9, 10,  11, 12, 13, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 8 months.  I will start listening to David Lee Roth a month into it, because within a month, he will  run out of shit to say, because it happens to the best of them.  And that's when it'll get good.  And that's when it gets entertaining.  He'll start admitting crap that's not even true at that point. 
[00:08:30]  How many I hate Sammy Hagar stories can you possibly tell?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  These dopes, they think radio's easy.  It's really a pain in the ass job.  That's why we go on vacation as much as humanly possible.  And then we get to read the message boards and hear people bitch that we're not live.  Yeah.  We had to, you know, get our heads together.  Did that happen?  I didn't read enough.  I don't know.  Message boredom when I was on vacation.  It was nice to get away for a little while, though. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  People don't understand that.  Again, it's one of these jobs that people just, you know, don't quite get.  They figure you just come in and spiel some stuff.  But sometimes you've got to blow off some steam.  You've got to take a little time away from the microphone.  Right.  Well, good luck to Infinity Broadcasting there.  Free FM.  Free.  One of the big stories that happened while we were on vacation.  It's free.  And then you've got, what, Adam Carolla on the West Coast?  Good luck there.  Who stinks on his own.  Absolutely stinks.  Yeah, Adam is not good.  He's good when he's with Jimmy Kimmel. 
[00:09:30]  He's good when he's with the good doctor.  Right.  He can't carry a show.  Mm-mm.  And Finney, goddammit, you guys are stupid.  They figured they would divvy up the kingdom.  Howie's little kingdom.  And, oh.  And then some people who were just bragging and bragging about how they're taking over  and bashing people, uh, stepped right over.  Uh, names that come to mind.  How about Mancock?  Mancock. 
[00:10:00]  Manqueer was crowing about how he's taken over this, that, and the other thing.  Eh.  Sorry, fella.  Sorry, fucko.  Sorry, pal.  Sorry, fucko.  And then, oh my goodness, what happened with Don and Mike?  Oh my goodness gracious.  Washington, D.C., WJFK.  You would think the, the, the, the, the top honchos over there at their station would get  the morning slot when Howard left.  I was passed over. 
[00:10:30]  I could do a show.  It's the way Sumner wanted it.  It ain't the way I wanted it.  On the older show, and I was passed over.  But, yep, Don and Mike, another, uh, show, uh, sorry guys, another, uh, crew that was  just crowing about how they're gonna be, uh, taking over for Howie.  Everyone was diving in there, trying to get a piece of the pie, and, uh, Infinity decided, 
[00:11:00]  fuck yous all, we're going with, uh, David Lee Roth and Adam Carolla.  Oh, this is a disaster.  Within a year, they will have new talk show hosts in place.  But it's free!  It's gotta be good!  People love free shit, don't they?  When we go with, and, and do an appearance, and we're giving away, like, free shirts,  don't people love it?  You know what free shirts are all about?  What?  They are, like, paper thin, with a million logos on them.  They shrink up, like a... 
[00:11:30]  And you end up washing your car with the damn shirt, with the free shit.  They become a midriff top that's like a trumpet bell, showing your tummy.  We all love when we get stuff for free, but the reality is, most free stuff stinks.  Yeah, it's awful.  But what's free radio?  You're gonna have a million Jewish people enjoying you?  Get us?  Yeah, we get us.  Yes, Jimmy.  I guess we gotta say hi to Jim Norton.  He's back in town for, what, two and a half days?  No, I'm for a week.  Yeah, you're here for the entire week?  All week.  All right. 
[00:12:00]  Well, we have our big party this evening.  Yeah, and I got some big surprises for tomorrow.  What do you got?  Not that we're off.  I forgot about that.  Oh, yeah, by the way, we're off tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yes.  So start bitching now.  Start your complaining now on the message boards about,  Dude, they just got back from vacation.  They're taking another day off.  You're all lucky we're doing today's show.  You're damn right they are.  You're damn right.  We do today's show.  We do tonight's show at the Hard Rock Cafe, the Halloween party.  We were gonna do Tuesday. 
[00:12:30]  We were gonna come in to work on Tuesday, tomorrow, after the Halloween party.  I don't know whose idea it was.  I remember sitting in the office, and the subject came up.  It was one of our big meetings.  And we decided, yeah, we'll come in.  Let's do it.  And I was sitting there, like, pissed off, knowing that we would suck.  We would suck.  I have to be in bed by the time the party starts.  How is that gonna work?  What time is this shindig getting started?  Doors open at 7.  7?  You know where I am, 7?  People are already wandering around. 
[00:13:00]  We're dead.  People are already wandering around Manhattan.  Getting ready for the party tonight.  I know.  I saw a few out front.  A few people out front stopped by to say hi.  I really looked great.  I looked like the definitive asshole to any fans.  I try to present myself as a humble human being.  I'll be not affected by radio and all this, our glamorous lifestyle.  So I pull up in my Escalade, my Cadillac, of course, to have it parked by an attendant.  Oh, Master Poe. 
[00:13:30]  And I get out and I have my little bag, my luggage, because I'm staying for a couple of  days since we're not gonna be working.  I get out and I immediately start bitching to Poe about the traffic.  Because for some reason, the traffic this morning was just an abomination.  It stunk.  So I start bitching and then I see there's a couple of eager, smiling-faced Lil fans  looking at me like I was crushing their dreams.  I wasn't the fun Anthony that they hear on the radio.  I'm this miserable fuck getting out of my expensive car with my luggage, bitching to 
[00:14:00]  the boy I'm handing my keys to.  What a dick.  And there they are, smiling.  I'm going to your party tonight.  Shut up, stupid.  I skated up.  I skated up and just said, who are you?  Oh, who are you?  Skating.  At least you're you.  You're on your rollerblades.  That's what they expect out of you.  Yeah.  Like me.  It's gonna be a great time.  A miserable bastard they encountered.  It's gonna be a creep fest tonight. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, what a bunch of ghouls.  Anything with a vagina, stay away.  You're not permitted in.  It's gonna be horrible.  What a sausage fest it's gonna be down there.  Just people with awful costumes trying to tie themselves into this program somehow.  What do you think we're gonna see the most of?  What do you think?  Best hog.  I think Lil' Jimmy Norton.  I think we're gonna see a lot of Jimmy Nortons with, like, impaled on a two-year-old.  Some really bad humor.  Somebody with that fake duty on their chest. 
[00:15:00]  It's actually a good costume idea.  Duct-taped milk duds to his nipples.  Awfulness.  And the party's gonna be broadcast on 202 tonight.  Ron and Fez are gonna do the honors.  Yeah.  After over a year, we're finally putting something spontaneous on the station.  Remember how we talked about that when we first came on?  Remember all the interviews we did and we said, well, you know what?  This opens up the platform.  We're able to now, if we want to have a party and broadcast it, we can do that.  And after over a year, we're finally doing it because even Opie and I realize how sucky it will be to broadcast a live appearance. 
[00:15:30]  Because you know how they go.  They're just, they're loud.  It's impossible to do a real show.  And that is why it's the Opie and Anthony Halloween party hosted by Ron and Fez.  So they have to make it into a radio show.  We're not even hosting our own party.  And believe me, if they were here longer, they would have refused to do it, too.  Of course.  They just don't have the juice yet.  All of a sudden, they're going to go, all right, let's go to the stage and listen in on Opie and Anthony. 
[00:16:00]  And we'll be just babbling about nothing.  We're not going to talk about it.  All right, throw it back to Ron and Fez.  No, we don't even do that.  No, we don't throw it.  No, they just take it.  We do nothing.  They just take it back when they realize how bad it really is.  Well, they'll be taking it back very quickly.  But all the bands, I guess, will be live.  I plan on doing nothing.  All the bands will be live on that channel today.  That's true.  You'll be able to hear Tribute Bands.  I believe it's going to be a new XM channel.  Tribute Band 303.  I think it's going to be called.  So you're going to be able to hear Joe and 2U and Live Wire and 2112, the Rush Tribute Band. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Who's Live Wire?  Just get on us.  Don't you touch that mic before the first hour, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, don't slow us down, man.  Who's Live Wire?  Can't you hear the energy in this room, Joe?  We're trying to sit right there on the liberator.  I'm eating chocolate and it's a quarter after.  I'm eating chocolate.  You know why?  I'm a big boy.  I'm an adult.  If I want to have cake for breakfast, I do it.  Absolutely.  Do you ever get hit with those moments where you're like, you're doing something like that? 
[00:17:00]  I've eaten cake at 7 in the morning.  Big chocolate cake.  And you go, I'm an adult.  I've earned this right.  Just because I'm a big boy now.  And that's what I'm doing now.  I'm eating chocolate.  I'm just the opposite.  Like, it'll be 3 in the morning and I'm jerking off online and I'm like, you're 37.  What are you doing?  When does this end?  We're on quite the little seesaw here, aren't we?  Hey, we've got to back up really fast. 
[00:17:30]  I want to thank the Daily News for promoting our big Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe tonight.  You know, any time we make it into the Daily News, I'm very excited, Opie.  What picture will they use?  Thank you, David Hinckley and the staff of the Daily News.  Go fuck yourselves.  What a horror.  Again.  I remember this event.  What a fuck yous today.  Wasn't this our kickoff?  We signed with XM and we had a press conference.  Well, we're looking at the two pictures they're using for this little ad they're doing for us or whatever. 
[00:18:00]  They're promoting us.  And the pictures were definitely taken at our press conference announcing that we were going to go to Satellite Radio and be the pioneers of Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  At this point, we've been off for two years, just abusing ourselves.  And it's pretty much our first public pictures that were taken.  They took hundreds of pictures.  Hundreds.  We've seen them all.  Some are good.  Some are bad.  They picked the worst pictures to put in the Daily News.  We've entered the Hillary Clinton kind of section of the Daily News. 
[00:18:30]  Anytime they have a picture of her, her mouth is wide open and her eyes are all buggy.  Yeah.  That's what they do.  Well, they look for the worst pictures of us because I know I look like I'm answering an indictment for kiddie porn.  That is the only – that is a businessman.  It looks like I'm running my own business.  I was caught.  It's on my computer.  And I'm answering to charges.  I'm sweating.  My hair's a wreck.  Can we get these pictures online so the fans can make fun of us? 
[00:19:00]  And Opie's is – it's not even in focus.  It's not even in focus.  I know they took hundreds that day.  They're trying to tell me that every single one was out of focus.  That's the blurry picture you either get on two occasions in the paper.  You were killed in a motorcycle crash, and that's the only picture they can get of you.  Or you've left the country because you don't want to answer to charges, and that's the only picture they have of you.  Blurry.  Your head is tossed back in some type of laughter.  Yeah, and there's no sign of eyes anywhere. 
[00:19:30]  No, no.  Know what this picture reminds me of, too?  The same type of thing where they need a picture of someone that did something horrific.  Yeah.  And the only picture they got is maybe a class photo.  So they got to, like, zoom way in on the particular face of the person that did that awful thing.  So it's all grainy?  It's all grainy because they had to go deep, deep, deep, you know, focus in there.  Yeah, you're like in a picture that was taken across the room with 20 other people.  And they just – yeah, they just –  You're, like, just zooming in on a picture like this is, like, New Year's Eve, 1921. 
[00:20:00]  You zoom in.  You ask.  By the way, if you didn't know, the big smile – the name of this radio show, according to this picture,  should be The Happy Idiot and the Sullen Douche.  This is the fucking worst shot of two people.  Not horrible.  Thank you, Daily News.  Thank you, Daily News.  We know exactly what you're doing.  You do it all the time with everybody.  You find the worst picture possible, and you print it up.  We get it.  We get it.  And we don't need your help to promote our parties.  It's going to be a fucking zoo down there tonight. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, we're all looking forward to that.  Absolute zoo.  All looking forward to it.  All right, let's say hi to a couple people, and we'll move on with what?  I don't know.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Welcome back.  Thank you, sir.  You can make it back for the Halloween party tonight, you know, nonetheless, on your birthday and everything.  I know.  I was actually going to have my own birthday party, but I'm like, you know what?  The show's party is more important.  Hey, I showed you at the cellar on Saturday night.  Was that the first time you tried doing that Billy Crystal bit?  No, no, I've tried it before, but the ending, oh, it's the ending, it keeps bombing. 
[00:21:00]  I haven't figured out the ending to it yet, but no, I've actually done that before, but  I'm switching the ending, and it's bombing.  Yeah, I just want to know you guys are so, like, tightly knit that you guys can just shit  on each other.  But anyway, I just wanted to know, um, are there going to be, like, different categories?  Are you guys going to do something with just, like, the women, something with just the men,  like, uh...  Opie, this is our first phone call back from vacation?  Yeah, and he wants to know about the costume party tonight.  After babbling about Jimmy, uh, now he wants to know about the costume thing.  I'm sorry, Anthony. 
[00:21:30]  You're, you're, let me tell you, sir, your call stinks.  Yes.  I just, I'm, I, we'll, we'll keep going with it, but it really is bad for the first call  back.  Basically, we're going to have a bunch of people just walking around, checking out costumes  and handing out numbers, I guess, and then we'll get all you silly folks up on the  stage, and then we'll do, hey!  Dude, we're not breaking any new ground at the costume contest.  It's not going to be some weird twist to it.  I have an idea.  Let's vote by audience applause.  Oh, we put our hands over their head, and the one that gets the loudest applause wins. 
[00:22:00]  Wow, Jimmy.  Hello.  You are the idea man here.  Came up in L.A., I said, let me keep it under my hat until I get here.  So, hobnobbing with the stars, you kind of, uh, pick up some of their ideas, I guess.  Yeah, it brushes off.  Yeah, sure.  All right, let's say hi to Tom the trucker.  Tom, what's up?  Yeah, oh, cue the stuttering, mumbling fuck here.  Hi, guys, welcome back.  Oh, no.  Thank God, live radio again.  Yeah, let's try to keep it that way.  He's all nervous. 
[00:22:30]  He's nervous, caller guy.  Yes, sir, yes, sir.  You're on the air, millions of people.  Yes, sir.  I grew up in the Hamptons.  I've had a beer at Billy Joel, and you reduced me to a quivering pile of Jell-O.  I think everybody's had a beer with Billy.  I'm punching out.  I've got nothing.  Bye.  Wow.  What is going on with our listeners, man?  That is the worst call.  They're still on vacation.  They haven't gotten back yet.  Our callers and our listeners, still vacationing.  Billy in Florida, what's up?  I just wanted to say that it seems like you guys are like, the only thing that come to 
[00:23:00]  have with listeners, but he says they always pick the worst picture for the dealing news.  Yeah.  You guys are saying you guys have the worst picture they picked, right?  Yeah.  And he says the same thing every time.  Like, they take so many pictures of him, yet they always pick the worst, nastiest picture.  Who, who?  Well, the papers do that in general.  Yeah, they do that.  Celebrities.  Oh, really?  Not saying we're the only ones.  Hillary is a good example.  Well, I'd say the only ones.  There are a few other.  There are lucky guys, like, you know, Brad Pitt and stuff, that just, uh... 
[00:23:30]  They don't take a bad picture.  I guess they don't take bad pictures.  I was going to say, they just put in the good pictures on them.  All right, Billy, thank you.  Thank you.  I don't know what you were getting at, but thank you for that.  Charlie from Whack Bag.  What's up, Charlie?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, I just want to congratulate Jimmy on his HBO special.  It was awesome, man.  It really was.  It really was a great special.  I missed it, Jimmy.  You should have T-voted, you silly goose.  It's on demand, right?  I'll demand my Jimmy.  We want Jimmy.  I love that.  On demand.  My schedule, pally. 
[00:24:00]  I'm not going to...  I'm not going to kowtow to Jimmy tap dancing to him.  Oh, here's a good costume idea, by the way, for tonight.  Speaking of the HBO special.  Somebody could put a cock in their ass and cum as Anthony's bow.  Wow.  Now, wait.  We discussed this when it first happened.  I am very happy that you...  I think that was the second take.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, why not the first take when I did the point, and then you ripped off my point?  We both did the point at Jimmy, like, pa-choo, pa-choo.  I did the point. 
[00:24:30]  You did the thumbs up.  You did the thumbs up in the first one.  I did thumbs up.  I did the point.  And thumbs up, more asinine than point.  I did thumbs up, point, pa-choo, pa-choo.  All right.  That's really stupid.  I just pointed.  I went like, Jimmy, you are the man.  It's your night.  Yeah, don't worry about us.  Don't worry about us.  When they pan the camera over to us.  That was the first take in the night.  The second take, I guess I thought it would be funny to do a bow.  It's really bad. 
[00:25:00]  I know.  All right.  Your left arm is on your hip.  No, it's not.  Dude, it's fucking...  I do that?  It's awful.  I actually got an email from Robert Reed.  He just said, faggot.  I did not do it.  Let me see.  Do it.  Do it for me.  Oh, you did not do that.  No.  Dude, can Steve has got unfoundry.  It's fucking...  No, I did not do that.  Can we get that unfoundry music?  I put my hand on my hip.  Horrendous.  Like I'm a little teapot, short and stout. 
[00:25:30]  Yes, that's a big cock.  Now put it in my mouth.  I did not.  And then I bowed like royalty.  Yeah, you bowed and then you did the hand rollover.  The hand rollover.  In front of you.  What an ass.  What a...  Well, we'll have to get that up on foundrymusic.com.  I already talked to people at HBO, too, about getting the first show intro of you guys, too,  because of that thumbs up.  Because I actually got emails from people, how come I didn't show Opie's thumbs up?  See, the thumbs up.  You skated on this.  Thank God.  You skated.  I look like douchebag because they use second tape. 
[00:26:00]  I was just so happy to be mentioned on HBO.  I just lost my mind.  Yeah.  But then the second take, I had time to calm down.  I'm breathing.  All right.  See, now I took it the other way.  The second take, I was all loose and figured I'd be a funny guy with my bow, and I come  off looking like an idiot on HBO.  Well, you know what it is?  It's on whack bag.  Somebody has it as a sig pic.  Oh, they do already?  Of course.  They did fucking eight minutes after it aired.  As it aired, they actually had it.  You just tipping and bowing.  Idiot.  Oh, you got to say it.  We got to get that on opiananthony.com. 
[00:26:30]  Great.  Definitely got to get that up.  Yeah.  We got lots of stuff we have to get up on the website immediately today.  Anyone dressing tonight?  You got a little costume?  I'm scared of you.  Why?  Why?  Anyone dressing?  Jimmy?  Costume?  Anyone of the staff?  The opiananthony staff?  Nothing?  Danny?  You're dressing up?  Is it a secret?  Why do people have to keep it a secret?  Yeah, like we're all going to go, oh, my God.  Oh, look at Danny. 
[00:27:00]  It's like when they come to the door, the little kids.  Oh, it's a princess.  Danny?  Danny?  Hello, fellas.  What are you, um, hi, welcome back.  Did you enjoy your vacation?  Oh, it was terrific.  Staying home for a week.  Did you have one?  No, I...  You guys get a vacation?  I have no idea what the staff does when we're vacationing.  I have no idea what the staff does, quite frankly.  I have no idea.  I assume you vacation when we vacation.  Kind of.  The windows are a little dirty.  You could have come in a little earlier and taken care of that, but...  And what are you going to dress as this evening? 
[00:27:30]  Jamie Groom.  Oh, very good.  There you go.  See, that's good.  Yeah.  And, uh, what is that costume going to include?  Uh, a wig.  Uh-huh.  A basket with some lotion in it.  Very good.  I like when you have to carry something around with you all night so people know who you are.  That's the item right there.  That spells bad costume, doesn't it?  And precious?  Any, um, moths or business cards? 
[00:28:00]  No, actually.  Maybe I'll bring some now.  You could throw them down and just go, uh, and run away.  No?  Maybe I'll bring some now.  Yeah.  I figured I'll just run around the party with, you know, pinching my nipples, go, uh, that'll  let people on.  All right.  Back in the box.  Definitely back at work.  We'll be looking forward to that.  All right.  Very good.  I like the costumes, though, where you have to carry something all night long.  Yeah.  The second you put it down, no one knows what you're supposed to be.  Anthony, you're dressing up tonight? 
[00:28:30]  Of course I am.  It's my standard, um, uh, EverQuest character costume.  I'll be wearing my puffy bloused shirt and my, uh, rapier at my side.  Are you going to be doing some LARPing?  That's who I'll be.  Anthony's a LARPer.  Watch it.  Hit damage.  Hit damage.  That's who I'll be.  This is my soundtrack.  What the hell is this music from?  Derek doesn't even know.  Derek doesn't know.  It's just some faggy, EverQuest-y type music. 
[00:29:00]  Yes, uh, Derek?  It's, uh, the sword fight scene from the Princess Bride.  Ooh.  Yes.  Good selection.  Thank you.  By that I mean horrible selection.  He was waiting a half hour to play that for you.  I know.  Yeah, that's what I'll be doing.  Oh, my bow is up.  Up on the, uh, internet.  Let's take a look.  Ugh!  Oh, what a...  Oh, look at how awful this is.  Ah!  I did not do that.  Was I drunk?  Ah!  It's not like anyone will see it. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, Christ.  Thank God.  It's public access.  Oh.  Not HBO.  I think you were drunk on a bleachy white substance.  That was really...  I wouldn't do that in a whole movie.  And it's on HBO.  Over and over for the entire month.  What an asshole.  Oh, and DVD's coming, I'm sure.  I'm sure of it.  Ooh.  Wow.  All right.  How embarrassing.  We have so much to do.  I don't know.  I don't even know where to begin. 
[00:30:00]  We've got to remind the folks that Stalker Patty's going to be on Maury Povich today, though.  Yes.  That's another thing that's happening today.  We've got the Halloween party tonight.  And Stalker Patty on Maury Povich at 10 o'clock here in New York.  Yeah, she had a makeover or something.  We had introduced her to Maury as a 50-year-old virgin.  And I thought that's the angle they were going to take on Maury Povich.  Bring her on, explain that she's a 50-year-old virgin, and maybe try to get her late or something.  But they went with a makeover thing.  She's 50, and she's a little mousy mess. 
[00:30:30]  And they decided to give her a makeover and make her a mousy mess with a red dress on,  because that's the only difference I really saw in the poor gal.  She didn't really come off as...  You know those makeovers that are stunning?  Yeah.  You ever see those?  The show, it's like they bring her out, and she's a mess, and then they bring her out,  and oh, my God, she's a...  You know, who knew that was under there?  This was just...  Hers was, eh, not bad.  Real?  That good?  Eh, not bad.  Her dress was falling off. 
[00:31:00]  She really has no chest, which, you know, that's fine and dandy,  but the dress they put her in needed something.  So it was just kind of hanging there like a couple of the tennis balls in the sweat socks.  Yeah, yeah.  Really not an attractive look for the patchster.  All right.  Is that today, 10?  Yeah, 10 o'clock.  10 Eastern.  So we could kind of watch and comment, I guess.  We'll do that today as well.  Rancid pits.  We got a quick...  She was all stinky from being nervous. 
[00:31:30]  Halloween, her armpits are coming.  It's Staten Island.  Yes, I will look fancy tonight, Steve, from Bayshore.  I will have to do...  Am I going to have to do my bow on stage?  Ugh.  They're going to be...  In that get-up, too?  Oh, Jesus.  Just beat me over the head with my own rapier.  Let's go to Mike in New Orleans.  Mike?  Yeah, welcome back, boys.  I was wanting to ask Anthony...  And welcome back to your fine city.  They're already partying down there. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, it's wonderfully dirty as usual.  Throwing concerts every weekend now.  Yeah.  Celebrating the fact that you guys are on the rebound.  Absolutely.  Anyway...  I was going to know if that's the way Anthony used to bow when he would help Groucho with  the shows back in the 1800s.  I...  Shut up.  I did not help Groucho.  And yes, Groucho taught me how to bow like that.  All right.  Groucho, Mark.  Someone photoshopped in a rapier in my hand as I did the bow.  Now I look completely ridiculous. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you.  I love my fans.  Mike in Maine.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right, Mike.  What's up?  I wanted to let you know that Don Imus recognized your one-year anniversary on his show about  15 minutes before he went on the air.  Oh.  Thank you, Mr. Imus.  That's nice of him.  Thank you, Mr. Imus.  Yeah.  I had my own congratulations.  I've been a long-time listener of you guys now.  Thank you.  Is it really our one-year anniversary?  Well, it was three weeks ago.  We were just too lazy to organize two separate parties, one three weeks ago for our one-year  anniversary on the Halloween party. 
[00:33:00]  We all sat together in the office during another high-powered business meeting, didn't we?  And we sat there and said, why don't we combine both parties?  That way we can have a big, bitchin' ass Halloween party instead of, why don't we combine both  so we really don't have to work hard and make two parties?  The actual anniversary of one year at XM was just a disaster.  Yeah.  So we get a second shot at it.  Our big highlight that day was a phone call from Dee Snider.  Who could care less about us.  From Twisted Sister.  That was our big one-year anniversary gala. 
[00:33:30]  You would think maybe people that had something to do with the show would have called that day.  No, we had Dee Snider.  Who could care less?  Our stupid agent didn't even call and congratulate us.  Ah, whatever.  I knew that.  I knew that.  It'd get him going.  Why?  I mean, Bob was busy.  I mean, he could have called, but he's had some stuff to do.  Stuff to do.  Doesn't include Opie and Anthony.  Uh, yeah, I was calling about Ernest in the morning.  Oh, their coffee pot is broken.  Our agent's like one of those fathers that just, like, bang women everywhere around the  country and have kids all over. 
[00:34:00]  And, like, they have their kid of the week is the one they take care of.  And then they just kind of go off and we don't get toys anymore.  I don't know.  I don't really get him anymore.  I notice a check goes out to him, though, every year.  Oh, yeah.  A nice big check.  10%.  Nice big check.  But he's too busy trying to get Rover as many fucking cities as possible.  Oh!  Does he handle Rover?  Yeah, he does.  Oh, that's a nice paycheck for Bob.  Cha-ching.  Congrats, Bob.  I understand why you haven't been around lately.  That's right. 
[00:34:30]  Anyway, uh, we got a sucks to be you story before we go to break here, Anthony.  Uh, is it sucks to be you or unlucky lottery?  No, this is sucks to be you.  A lot of people have a hard time distinguishing between unlucky lottery and sucks to be you.  I think it's a sucks to be you.  Why?  Well, why don't we just play it?  Okay.  And then you can decide.  Let me hear it.  Hundreds of people gathered at a church in Waco, Texas, last night to pay tribute to their  pastor who died tragically on Sunday.  He was electrocuted in front of his congregation as he was about to perform a baptism when he reached  for a microphone while standing in water. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, my.  God.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Are you shitting me?  There's no God.  There's no God.  Just stop it with the God.  Stop with the God.  Or God has a very good sense of humor.  That's the same thing as the church bus that's on its way to, you know, some big church event  and a boulder rolls into the side of it.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah, that's a sucks to be you.  That's definitely a sucks to be you.  So unlucky lottery is when something happens and the odds of it happening are astronomical 
[00:35:30]  in line with winning lottery with the lottery, which would be a good thing.  And you would love to defeat those odds and actually win lottery.  But you win a horrific death that obviously is incalculable in odds of it happening.  A tree, perhaps, that had been standing in the same place for 150 years decides right  at the point you drive your car at 80 miles an hour past it that it's going to fall on 
[00:36:00]  top of you.  That's unlucky lottery.  Right.  This guy, though, definitely sucks to be you.  Sucks to be you.  And what did he do?  Devoting his life to God and he has to die like that in front of his congregation.  No God.  Stop with the God.  And stop with the mysterious ways thing.  Or that it was meant to be or something like that.  It was meant to be.  He offers his life to God.  How about you're just snoozing in bed and you don't wake up?  Something like that.  How about you don't affect an entire church who's now having nightmares? 
[00:36:30]  You wake up at night.  Imagine that one.  And all those people in the church are going to now question their own faith.  Oh.  Was he a funny guy?  Does it say that?  Because if he was like the joking pastor, there had to be a couple of people that thought  he was joking.  Like, ah, look, he grabs the mic and he, no, he's not stopping.  If he was black, they probably thought he was just dancing in the water a little bit.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Well, I could do a dancing joke.  No, I'm just fine.  That's horrible. 
[00:37:00]  I could do a dancing joke.  What kind of dummy grabs a microphone in water?  How do you know?  How don't you know?  Electricity in your waist deep in water?  How many times did G.G. Allen have a mic in his hand as he pissed himself?  Nothing ever happened to him.  That's true.  It's not like he's swimming in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.  He says, swim, swim, swim, swim.  We've got words out today.  Horrible.  Looking for something, O.P., are you?  What are you looking for, huh?  Well, because I want to play priest as we go to break in honor of this fine gentleman 
[00:37:30]  that gave his life.  It's not there.  Or is it over there?  Is it there?  Should it be?  If it was there, the boss would have found it, Hawk.  All right, why don't you throw that in there?  All right, we're going to take our first break.  Jim Norton is home for a few days, four days.  We'll talk to Jimmy, see how L.A. is doing and his HBO show.  He's all affected now.  Yeah, he's starting to dress more like L.A.  Dressing.  Where is your, I don't know, Ozzy Osbourne T-shirt? 
[00:38:00]  He's wearing a button-down, long-sleeved shirt now today.  Very nice.  Stand up.  Can I see your trousers, Jimmy?  He's wearing jeans, but they are fashionable jeans.  That's the whole look out in L.A. is like that.  And what about your shoes?  Your pets?  What are you wearing on your feet?  Oh, babe, I'm wearing a pair of docks.  You got your docks?  Of course I do.  How long were you out there?  Dude.  You fell asleep next to an L.A. bean pod and woke up, and now you're like, you're a celebrity.  These are jeans I've been wearing for years. 
[00:38:30]  Does the security guy at the gate know you at the studio?  Well, yeah, yeah.  Sometimes I'll just, like, there's two ways to get in.  What happens is, you have to pull up, and they look at you, and they raise the little fence.  Right.  But sometimes if there's a line getting in, I'll just drive in the outside, and he'll just wave,  and I wave, and the thing goes up, and I've got to pull into the spot.  Three weeks you've been out there?  Well, how long?  We've been shooting, we've shot five episodes.  Shot.  So, sometimes I'll just go straight, and I'll pull it into the spot that says Jay Norton, 
[00:39:00]  and I'll just pull it there.  Jay Norton.  Yeah.  How thick is that paint that says Jay Norton on there?  Do they scrape it off when the new guy gets there, or is it...  It's very paint-overable.  Does your license plate hit it on the way in?  Really?  Because I'm sure there's plenty of names.  You take a little paint remover, and go under Jay Norton, and see what's under there.  Go down until you get to the girl that played Tootie on Facts of Life or something.  You go right under, you see Elle Kudrow.  Yeah, believe me, I realize that that can be... 
[00:39:30]  Of course, some dick fan pointed that out.  I'm all bragging.  He's like, hey, dick, they can just paint over that.  Of course.  No.  Keep the Jim Norton stencil out there in the shed, just in case.  This shirt was from a pack of shirts that I bought when I was doing Tough Crowd.  It's one of my old Tough Crowd shirts.  Oh, so it's a, you're going to be smart shirt.  Yeah.  I like that.  This is my leg-crossing shirt.  Yeah.  You put your finger and thumb on your chin and go, hmm.  Gentlemanly discussion shirt.  Colin, yes, your hair looks ridiculous. 
[00:40:00]  I would wear an Aussie shirt, but some people out in Hollywood may not like Aussie.  I don't want to offend anybody.  Of course you don't.  Yeah, he's going to get to that point, too.  It's the new Jimmy.  It's the LA Jimmy.  Yeah, where he's not going to want to insult anybody.  He's not going to want to talk about celebrities, because to him, it's just an open door he'll  be closing.  A bridge to be burned.  Hey, look.  Keep as many doors open as possible.  Of course.  That's Hollywood Jimmy.  And I'm glad, look, and you guys wanted to make fun of Free FM.  I really don't have an opinion on it, but I mean, I'd say give it a dang word.  Free FM blows suck.  Huge press release, like we're all supposed to be scared in satellite radio. 
[00:40:30]  It's free.  It's free.  You have to pay for it like this.  Free means it stinks.  Everyone knows that.  Free.  All right, we got the pre-song from Stephen Lynch.  Not a version anymore.  Great.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  Deep in prayer, my cross to bear, I kneel upon the floor.  Temptations of a Catholic priest are easy to ignore. 
[00:41:00]  But I cannot control myself.  It rips my soul apart.  For one small sheep among my flock has stoned the shepherd's heart.  Altar boy, altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[00:41:30]  At Sunday mass or Bible class, I catch him in my view.  So I close my eyes, but there he lies, spread-eagled on the pew.  And when I see him in that frock, my conscience goes awry. 
[00:42:00]  I'll give him some communion wine that's spiked with Spanish fly.  Altar boy, altar boy, altar boy, is it gonna be heaven or hell?  You can play my organ all night long, if you promise never to tell.  Shh.  Ooh. 
[00:42:30]  My father, who loves heaven, hallowed be thy name.  I could dress him up like the Pope, and then I, oh dear God, the shame.  No, no, lead us not into temptation.  Deliver us from sin.  We could pretend that he was Jesus Christ, and I was Mary Magdalene.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:43:00]  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  Oh, altar boy, oh, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, altar boy.  Toriii.  Toriii.  The profound exclamour, I say, dominate, dominate, I devote to me, I'm fiant, I'm doing... 
[00:44:00]  Stay down.  Next time, on a very special Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray goes to the doctor.  Ray, would you like to see your test results?  Yeah!  Oh, boy.  What are you doing?  Ray, I'm afraid you've got AIDS.  No, come on!  You have a rare strain of HIV.  No!  Commonly found in post-op Portuguese transsexuals. 
[00:44:30]  No!  The fun really begins when Ray's wife finds out.  Why is the toilet filled with bloody poo?  God.  Oh, my God, the bed is full of scabs.  Hot.  But everything works out in the end.  Sweetie, you're losing so much weight, I bought you a smaller robe.  Hey, what the heck is this?  Ray, your mother's here.  She wants to say goodbye.  Oh, where are you doing?  All on the next Everybody Loves Raymond, tonight at 8.  There's too many men  Too many people  Making too many problems 
[00:45:00]  And there's not enough love to go around  And to me, this is a lot of confusion  This is the world we live in  And these are the hands we're getting  You certainly let's start trying  To make it a place worth living in 
[00:45:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program  First show back  First live show, I guess  Since going on vacation  Yeah  It's Halloween  Kitty  Halloween night at the Hard Rock Cafe  Is going to rock  A lot of people listening to us from  All over the country  Well, we're going to be broadcasting  The festivities tonight  Right here on 202  Starting at  I don't even know  7  Is it starting at 7?

[00:50:30]  They double standard  Well  He's not accepting  The lifeguard of the year  Award  Tommy Lee  No  Actually  Spike TV's talking to us  These days  Okay good  Because Viacom is splitting  So now all those  All those asses  That had it out for us  You know  They can't control  Our careers as much  As they have been  In the last few years  Oh do you think  It went high  Okay maybe it went  Over Spike's head then  Maybe it went to people  Viacom is splitting  And now we're starting  To get a little action  Is the radio division  Being sold off  I don't know  What they're doing  They split it up  They like split everything up 
[00:51:00]  Between the five families  I don't know what it is  I have no joke there Jimmy  Me neither  I had nothing  I was just looking at you  Hoping something was popping up  And we'll both just look back  At all  That's what happens  Let's see what this is all about  Okay well  Let's go to the Gooch in Cleveland  Gooch  Gooch I guess you're not  Going to make it  To the Halloween party tonight  Huh  No  That's too bad  I can't make it  I'll just walk around here  Dressed like an idiot  Oh Gooch  Hey I never knew 
[00:51:30]  What you guys meant  By douche chills before  Until I saw Anthony  Do that little bow  And then I totally  Totally understood  That bow is awful  Thank you Eric  Keep spinning the monitor around  To show me  Every two seconds  I like the one with the sword  In my hand  Can I now be completely  Honest with you  Yeah  When you guys were mentioning  The bow about a half hour ago  I had no idea  What you guys were talking about  But I played along with it  Knowing it was bad for you  Anthony  Uh huh  Because when I was watching  The HBO thing  All I was concerned about  Was how good I looked  Yeah  I didn't have time 
[00:52:00]  To look  I'm right next to you  I didn't have time  To look to my right  To see how good you looked  My friend  Didn't your peripheral vision  Pick up movement  Yeah  Like my hand  Flapping like that  I was wondering why  My hair was blowing in the wind  Horrible  Gayest thing I've ever seen  Yeah it really is bad  That bow should come  With a robe  With the pockets full  Of a never ending tissue supply  Comes with an AZT prescription  That's what Jim was getting at  Alright we got Halloween stories 
[00:52:30]  Halloween stories  Are coming in like crazy  Hey do we have the audio  Of the sex offenders  They're not allowed out  Past 7 o'clock tonight  It's great  We gotta get the audio  Is that what's going on?  Yeah in New York  If you're a sex offender  There's a curfew tonight  So you don't touch any children  This is probably  The safest night for kids  Cause you can't see  Which ones are hot  And knocks  They're all wearing  Those stupid costumes  They're all well protected  Yeah I don't know  No one wants to fuck a pumpkin  And go to jail for it  But that little  Loatian boy  He's running around in July  Idiots  We gotta get the audio 
[00:53:00]  Of the sex offenders  They're not allowed out tonight  God man  Nothing happens on Halloween  How are they gonna  How do they know?  Huh?  Like how would you even  Identify that it's a sex offender?  That's a good question Anthony  If he's out  Very good question  You know  They would have to  Do they carry cards?  Is it a  Maybe an ankle bracelet thing?  If we had the audio  Maybe we could get to the bottom  Of this very important story today  I know how by the way  Because the sex offenders  Normally wear costumes 
[00:53:30]  Where they'll expose their genitals  And on the t-shirt  They write  Lollipop here  And there's an arrow  Pointing down  Is that easy?  Yeah  And they don't even open the door  They just put it through  The little mail slot  And the kids go  And they walk away  By the way  Very good news  Anthony's  Anthony's video of him bowing  During Jim Norton's  Right  HBO special there  Is now up on  OPNAnthony.com  Ah  See how quickly the internet works  I love it  That's what it's all about  Getting stupid pictures of me  Online 
[00:54:00]  So people can laugh at me  And I will have that first one  So that thumbs up by the way  Is for everyone to see  We're gonna get that  No you won't  I want the thumbs up  No you won't  Yeah but how many people  Are gonna actually see that?  I don't know  Founder gets a couple hundred  A couple hundred hits  Compared to how many people  Are gonna watch your  Steve will come in here now  Your specialty  This month  A few hundred  Way more than that  Way more than that  Could be even more than that  I think it's gonna be  Even more than that  Jim  Here we go  We got some Halloween audio  Not the one I want yet 
[00:54:30]  But hopefully the boys  Will have it in here  You know right  Halloween mischief turns violent  A driver fed up with teams  Throwing eggs in his car  Decides to fight back  But when he confronts  Those pranksters  He's shot  And tonight cops are telling us  The gunman is just 15 years old  Fox 5's Lisa Cabrera  Is in the Mott Haven section  Of the Bronx right now  Lisa  That's right Dick  Karen  That 15 year old  You're talking about  Is facing attempted murder charges  After cops say  He and his friends  Opened fire on a man  That they had been throwing eggs at  Eric Fuller doesn't want you 
[00:55:00]  To see his face  Show my f***ing face man  Get in  Get in  Get in  But the 17 year old  Had some choice words  For photographers  Cops say he is one of about  12 teenage pranksters  Who started off  Throwing eggs  And ended up shooting a man  I find it crazy  Hard to believe  How people could just  Do something like that  The residents say  A 31 year old man  Became enraged  When the teens started  Throwing eggs at his minivan  That's when cops say  The man chased after the pranksters  Into this apartment building lobby 
[00:55:30]  Where he took three bullets  To the head  One in the back  And one in the arm  Oh my god  It's a shame  Francine Taylor has lived  In this Bronx housing development  For 40 years  These are young people  But they're not caring  About how old you are  I must give her respect  Nothing like that  If you're in the way  You get it  Residents say  The 31 year old  Ordered the teens  To clean his egg soaked car  They refused  And cops say  The bullets started flying  The man was rushed  To Lincoln Hospital 
[00:56:00]  In critical condition  As a teenage prank  Turns into criminal charges  And once again  Cops say  That shooter  Is only 15 years old  Which is of course  Why we cannot show you  His picture  Meantime  That 17 year old  Is charged  With criminal possession  Of a weapon  There are several suspects  Still on the loose  There you go  Don't you graduate  From prankster  To something else  When you pump  Three bullets  Into some guy's head  Them calling them  Pranksters 
[00:56:30]  Kind of  I don't know  It doesn't really  Put forth the  Severity of the crime  Here's the beauty  Of that  That they throw eggs  He has a gun  And he still runs  If I had a gun  I'd throw eggs  And when they ran up  I'd point the gun  And go clean off  Your own car  Fuckhead  Why do you run  When you have a pistol  Well  I don't know  But they  They certainly  Didn't have to  Shoot the guy  He deserved to be shot  I'm sorry 
[00:57:00]  A for driving  Your minivan  I was going to say  The minivan thing  B  Says a lot  For getting out  And chasing  Three teenagers  Into the projects  For throwing eggs  In the Bronx  If you're in the Bronx  Yeah  And your car gets hit  By eggs  Count your blessings  And keep going  It's Carlo Rizzi  Clean it up  Clean those eggs  Off the van door  Van wall  Asshole  Go ahead  What are you going  To shoot me  Be a murderer  Like your father  Yeah well  That's a Halloween tragedy  Opie 
[00:57:30]  Yeah it's very sad  Halloween tragedy  Very sad  You rarely hear about that  I'm so concerned  I continue to eat  My granola  I know  It just doesn't affect us  How does that affect  Me and my Halloween  How does that affect  Our party tonight  It won't  Joe and Jerry  We're just  We're awful cold people  Aren't we  No we're just  That's a dead guy  Just driving around  Well I mean  He's chasing the guys  And then they go  Into what  An apartment complex  Who hasn't done that though  I've been egged  Driving down the road  And then you get out  You shake your fist 
[00:58:00]  You do the  Hey you kids  Kind of thing  Like this  Oh I want  What  And you chase him  How many times  How many times  And then you get a little older  And you learn the flanking maneuver  And then you keep driving  And you outflank the youngsters  And come up behind them  Dude I got the shit beat out of me once  See  As a kid  Throwing snowballs  With my brothers  Oh you were the perpetrator  Oh yeah  25A  You know the cars go by pretty fast  And we were timing it perfectly  Great road also  To be throwing snowballs at people  On 25A 
[00:58:30]  It's not windy enough  We're timing it  And it's icy  Great  We're up on a little hill  Overlooking 25A  It's probably  You probably gotta  Throw those snowballs  Maybe I don't know  15-20 yards  Okay  So we see the cars coming from  You know  The back of the house  Or whatever  Yeah  And then  We're just  It's just mathematics  We're just like  Doing the lob  Oh lobbing  And then we got it  Figured out perfectly  We're hitting windshield  After windshield  Laughing our asses off  Thinking it's the funniest  Fucking thing ever  Right  It is  And some ass  Right up until  I don't even think 
[00:59:00]  I was a teenager  Maybe like  Maybe 13  Somewhere around there  And all of a sudden  Like you just said  It just brought back a memory  A guy flanked us man  Yeah  Flanked us  And we're throwing  And all of a sudden  We turn around  And there's one of the guys  That we  I guess we hit his car  Just beat the shit out of us  Yeah  Took two or three of us on  No problem  Because he was like  I don't know  Probably up in his upper 20s  You learn  You learn the flanking maneuver  As you get older  You try  When you first get hit  You jam on the brakes  You jump out  Run straight at him 
[00:59:30]  That never worked  A couple of them  Might even get a couple of snowballs  Thrown at you  Before they turn and run away  But then you learn  The flanking maneuver  Get around behind them  Take them by surprise  I like when they're  Like eight or nine years old  That way I know  I completely have the upper hand  If I look  If I flank them  And look and see  They're young ruffians  I'll  I'll just kind of  Skulk back into my vehicle  And drive away  And make up some story  Like I beat them up  But if they're eight or nine  You could smack them around 
[01:00:00]  And really get them crying  Maybe even spank them  You've been a very naughty boy  You parked that van  Close that front curtain  And then it's a little discipline  Am I right or wrong, boys?  Perhaps a bit more  If I may be so, Bose  You might be wrong on that one  Jimmy  I can't help people out in the neighborhood  Minister of firm  Firm bottom reddening  Your son is trying  Is attempting to throw snowballs  At my snowcat  He is a very woeful boy  Oh, shit 
[01:00:30]  No  Eh, great  When we're done with it  Oh, Eric  That was Eric  Derek points at Eric  Like it's his fault  Joe from Jersey  Way to go, Hawk  Joey, let's go  Hey, guys  Yeah, over here in Jersey  Some chick goes and hangs herself  Last week  And because it's Halloween  They just leave her up there  For a day and a half  No one even notices  Thank you  Another Halloween tragedy  We'll go to Stephen, Florida 
[01:01:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man  How about that Wilma?  Oh, please  I'm in Orlando  We didn't get much of it  But  Yeah, I was worried about Anthony  I was fine  Recent transplant from New York  Down here in Florida  And they're doing the same thing  With the sex offenders down here  They can't even put pumpkins out  They can't turn on their lights  Open their doors  Nothing  Oh, they're not allowed to decorate  The house up?  Yeah, that is kind of  Halloween, if you decorate your house  You're kind of inviting children over  But how many cases of 
[01:01:30]  Like, are there big cases  On Halloween of guys  Doing stuff like that?  I don't know  Because it always seems like  The kids go out alone, I guess  I don't know  It's kind of a dead giveaway, no?  It's like, oh, it's  A guy with no light on his door  You know, what does he do  For a living, you know?  Right  I don't know  I think they hype the danger  Of Halloween  A little more than  Oh, yeah  Definitely  Like, isn't it true  It's all urban myth  About the razor blades  And the apples  And stuff like that  I read that fine book  Culture of Fear  And they go way, way back  And they find out that 
[01:02:00]  You know, the kids that have been  Poisoned over the years  First of all  There's not many cases  Whatsoever  And most of them  Were inside jobs  Because parents wanted insurance  Oh, the mom or something  Yeah  But every year  The news has to scare  The crap out of us  With, are your kids safe?  Check their candy  Check this  Blah, blah, blah  Yeah, but even as a kid  Growing up  Before the news really started  Doing that whole fear-mongering thing  I remember, you know  Watch out  If somebody gives you an apple  Right  Don't eat it  Because there's, you know  A guy and he shoves razor blades in there  And you wouldn't  You know, you get that 
[01:02:30]  Kind of fear  Of biting into an apple  The whole  But why would you get the fear?  Because even as an eight-year-old  I understood how stupid that was  Because a razor blade  In the middle of an apple  How are you going to cover  The fact that  The razor blade's in there?  If you slip it in  On the bottom  Yep  No way  You don't think  You would see there was  Something wrong with the apple  I wouldn't eat an apple anyway  I'd throw it at the house  Giving away apples, you idiot  Would you  Halloween  Would it hurt to bite into an apple?  You think it had the razor  Go up in between two teeth  Into your gums 
[01:03:00]  Ow  Yes  Yeah, right in between the teeth  Right into the soft palate  Yes  It would hurt  I remember one Halloween  My friend Marvin and I  Were trick-or-treating  And there was one foreign man  Who was like  I don't have any candy  So Marvin took out his chewing gum  And put it over the eye hole  Of the man's door  And as we walked out  The man came out  And attacked Marvin  And put him in a headlock  And I just stood there  And watched  The man  Another bravery  Latent moment of your life 
[01:03:30]  Wait a minute  He didn't do anything  But put gum over his eye hole  Yeah  And the guy came out  He didn't kill him  He just like, you know  Put him in a headlock  Smacked around a little  Wow  I just stood there  And you stood there  Did you yell leave him alone  Like your other heroic moment  No  Leave him alone  Leave him alone  No, that wasn't me  That was my friend yelling that  At the guys who were chasing me  Oh  We were like wiggers  And we were walking through New Brunswick  Yeah  And getting chased  I had a butcher knife  And I threw it  As well you should  You had a knife  And you threw it 
[01:04:00]  Yeah  Because they were chasing us  With sticks  Oh, so give them the knife  No, I threw it to the side  Because they had bamboo sticks  Yeah, bamboo sticks are scary  Where the hell were you?  Was there one  Did one of them have a big cast iron pot on a fire?  They may as well have  It was on the Brunswick  And you threw the knife away  So it could not be used on you  I don't know why I did  I was just running  You were running  And figured if they catch me  I'm getting stabbed with my own knife  So you threw it to the side?  I don't know  Maybe I thought it was weighing me down 
[01:04:30]  I know I got whacked in the back with a stick  But as we crossed back to North Brunswick  They left us alone  Of course they did  Yeah  Hey, uh  Jesus  This guy knows how they do the razor blade thing  Oh  Mike on Long Island  Go ahead  Hey, what's up?  Hey  I find it easier if I  I mean, they stick the razor blade in  And cover the apple in caramel  Oh, a caramel apple?  A tasty treat for the youngin  Who eats those?  Like, if your mom made them at the house  That's fine  But who gives that away?  Throw it in your bag?  Big sticky mess?  Wait a minute, sir  You said for a second there 
[01:05:00]  You said when I  And then you said wait when they  Sorry  That was misdirection  Wow, that was really good  I'm sorry  Punching up  See, you kind of  No, no, no  You kind of came across like it was you  Yeah  That was really funny  Then you caught yourself like  Uh-oh  I better not give this away  Thank you  And then we were like  Wait a minute  This guy just  Said it was him  But it was  Alright, enough of the abuse  Punching up  Hey, going back  The suicide story's real? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah  I thought that guy was  No  No  I checked  I did my research  What is this about, Anthony?  Well, an apparent suicide of a woman found hanging from a tree  Went unreported for hours  Because passers-by thought the body was a Halloween decoration  The 42-year-old woman used rope to hang herself across the street from some homes  On a moderately busy road  Late Tuesday or Wednesday, state police said  The body suspended about 15 feet above the ground  Could be easily seen from passing vehicles 
[01:06:00]  Oh, that rocks  And she just  It looked like somebody  Like something somebody would have just rigged up  One of the people said that  Saw this  Thought it was a decoration  And the caller just had a day and a half, by the way  That she hung there  Yeah  Did you hear the caller?  She's hanging there for a day and a half  It gets longer and longer  Three hours  Three hours she was hanging there  This just in  Our pictures that appear  In the Daily News today  Are now up on opianthony.com  Oh, that's wonderful  The awful pictures the Daily News decided to use  To promote our Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe tonight 
[01:06:30]  I hope he's blurry shot in me answering to a child porn chart  What was that website?  Perverted Justice  That's what those sites put  Perverted Justice  That was our press conference  And we know they took hundreds of photos that day  And they obviously picked two of the  They picked a good one  Two of the bad ones  So, alright  A lot of instant feedback is coming in  People are very excited  To see me  Do my bow tonight 
[01:07:00]  I don't think I'm going to do my bow  Oh, really?  Oh, my God, Ant  After you did your bow  Did you pretend to be asleep?  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep  That bow reminds me of Freddie Mercury  Asshole  And when I did the flanking maneuver  Was I wearing my SS leather coat?  No  People don't forget shit on this show  Yeah, exactly  Because I just got one  Oh, the soft palates  Are in the back of the mouth  The hard palates 
[01:07:30]  Are in the front  And is actually behind the teeth  The razor would be jammed into their gums  Alright  You could swallow it  Huh?  That would hurt  Alright  Want to play, uh, Stephen Lynch  The Halloween song as we go to break here?  Which one?

[01:09:00]  To drink beers  Razorblades hidden in three musketeers  Screams from the basement of kids  Begging to be set free  That's what Halloween means to me  Ooh  That's scary  Tightening the clamps that are holding  Their little heads  So tight 
[01:09:30]  Putting my lips to their ears  As I whisper, please  Don't fight  I promise I'll let you go home  If you swear not to tell  A soul  Well, I'll just untie these  I'm kidding  Now where is my chainsaw?  Let's rock and roll  A pinch of your brother  A teaspoon of you

Nothing?  Alright  Trick or treat  Smell my feet  See, irony is an incongruity  Between what's expected  And what actually happens  Happens  So I can't  You can't taste it  Because your tongue is in

[01:16:30]  No  They think we're looking for nudity on TV  And it's just a mess  So hopefully we can find that  It might be on Whackbag  I think I might have read it on Whackbag  Or something  Alright so here's  No Filter Paul's latest assault  On the media  That happened while we were on break  Good evening Brenda  There is nothing nice about  An impending nor'easter  I gotta tell you  It is seriously windy out here right now  Maybe gusts 25 to 35 miles per hour  Right here at the beach  People are getting worried 
[01:17:00]  They're getting prepared  People are getting  Hey get your stuff out of the way here  Excuse me sir  Alright  What do you think about that  Excuse me sir  Please get out of the way  People here are getting prepared  Alright that's pretty good  What do you think about that  What do you think about that  What a complete buffoon  What a buffoon  He's loving these assaults on the media  He yells like a lunatic  Yeah  And that's no different than his behavior  When you're having coffee with him 
[01:17:30]  Or anywhere else in public  No  He's just an embarrassing guy  He wonders why we never do anything with him  He's always like  Oh would you like to come out with me wife  And we'll go have dinner somewhere  It's like no  Because he is the most embarrassing person to be around  I made the mistake once  Of saying that I was going to Atlantic City  I was going to stay at the Borgata  He showed up with his wife  We're sitting at a card table  I'm trying to play a poker  And a flush draw comes up 
[01:18:00]  And of course it's spades  And he has to real loud go  That's the only time you ever want to see spades around  Right right  You know I'm talking about the niggas  Right right  And he's all loud  And he's the loudest racist  If you're going to be a racist  You've got to do a little head thing first  You've got to look around  You've got to  You know real low  Make sure you're only in white people  White people that don't like other people of other races  But he just blurts this shit out  Like everyone wants to hear it  Well we got his first assault on the media 
[01:18:30]  Here's his first one  Yeah  Where he screams at  Is that from October?  Yeah he's got two  Okay  He's got two entries in this month's contest  Here's his first one  He's obsessed with this by the way  This is his full time job now  Todd Conner joins us live from New York Times Square  Todd  Hey there Greta  Mayor Michael Bloomberg  Is spending his day defending his actions  To make the threat public  And also to flood the city's subways  With thousands of police officers  And extra security 
[01:19:00]  Saying he would rather err on the side of  Also being rather cautious today  Reporters reporting countless abandoned bags  And other suspicious items  This bag found on train tracks in Midtown  Police closing  I like to report on that one  Because he was very very smooth  He was professional  He didn't get  He's not trying to have a conversation  With no filter Paul  Like this woman reported  The new one's great  Excuse me sir  Excuse me  Can I give Paul some advice though  Wait until you like 
[01:19:30]  Sneak up behind him  And then start yelling on camera  What Paul does  Is as he's pulling the car up  He starts to shout  And then he fucking closes the door  And runs over  But then they're ready for you  They're totally on to him  Before he gets near the shot  Here's every assault by Paul  Hello is this a news truck?  Yeah I'm just calling about telephones  I'll be there in like 20 minutes  Keep the camera rolling 
[01:20:00]  Ass  Why has no one used a bullhorn yet?  Ooh  Open up to the XM cellar radio  Now that would rock  Yeah  Use a bullhorn  Our latest thing is  We want the fine folks to engage the reporter  Open up to the XM cellar radio  No?  That's a little too early for that aunt  Ooh  A little too early  That would work  Okay  Boy would that screw up a broadcast  Once again here is  No filter Paul's latest attempt  Good evening Brenda  There is nothing nice about 
[01:20:30]  An impending nor'easter  I gotta tell you  It is seriously windy out here right now  Maybe gusts 25 to 35 miles per hour  Right here at the beach  People are getting worried  They're getting prepared  People are getting  Hey could you step out of the way here?  Excuse me sir  All right  Excuse me sir  Please get out of the way  People here are getting prepared  Sir  What do you think about that?  She's still polite calling him sir too  That's why they're called pests  Sir  Could you step out of the way? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah  You could listen to that  Oh okay  What did he say about something channel 9?  Was she on channel 9?  I don't know  Let's say hi to Paul  He's right here  Oh here he is  No filter Paul everyone  Paul  How are you?  Hey you lunatic  Hi Paul  How you doing Jimmy?  Good buddy  Thank you man  What did you say about channel 9?  I couldn't quite hear it  Well actually I have to give credit  There was another guy with me  The second half you were hearing  Was this kid Chris from Wagbag  Who goes by the name  Limpy McSinkfucker  Limpy McSinkfucker?  Yeah I gotta give him credit  He was the one who said  What do you think about that at the end? 
[01:21:30]  That was actually the third assault  We did that night  The what assault?  The two plus one assault  No what  Yeah but what would that be called?  The what?  The one less than fourth assault  One less than fourth  I'm gonna hang up on you  Unless you play along  What is it?  The third  Third  Third  Third  The third assault  It was third  Not the fourth  Or fifth  And the reason we didn't  Get behind those guys  And prepare was  They were facing the ocean  And there was absolutely  Nobody else about  And every time we drove past 
[01:22:00]  All these TV trucks  They kept noticing us  Oh okay okay  Yeah so actually  The guy Chris on his own  He did channel 7  At about 5pm  And he totally missed  He was  You know  Did it while they were  Showing the video  And um  Great  Yeah it's tough  Yeah exactly  But the guy from channel 7  Chased him  And took his hat  And his wow sticker  And tore it all up  And threw it in the sea  Threw it?  Threw it in the sea  In the sea?  In the sea  In the sea  Arrgh  Cause channel 7  They're getting hit  They've probably been hit  Like what  6-7 times this month 
[01:22:30]  Yeah they've been hit a lot  They've had enough  They're not popular  They're not funny at all  They've really had enough of us  But the best one  Was the second one  We did  We didn't get on camera  But you just heard a shout  For one second  Channel 12 in New Jersey  Which I think is just  Begging for attention  So they wanted us to do it  When we ran up there  After we did it  The guy's like  You know you didn't get on camera  Why are you guys doing this?  And the other guy Chris  He ran off  And he noticed  I was talking to the reporter  The reporter had a conversation  With me about it  Oh really?  Do you have a copy of that?  I have  I don't have a copy of him talking  I have a copy of just a split second  Of a shout 
[01:23:00]  And it's not even worth  You know  Posting  But  Not worth it  Nah  Alright  He's like  Why didn't you guys  Just let us do our jobs  And while he was talking to me  His camera guy  Was riding my license plate down  And I'm sitting  I'm like  Why are you riding my license  What are you going to get me charged  With being on a public sidewalk?  There's nothing they could do  Nothing  Yeah  They're just trying to scare our past  As long as you don't touch them  There's nothing they could do  But the worst part of the whole evening  Was  We actually videotaped the UPN 9  One from behind the scenes  But it got wet  In that huge storm 
[01:23:30]  And the guy Chris  Got grabbed  And slammed against the UPN 9 truck  And the video got trashed  Oh really?  Yeah  Right after he said  What do you think about that?  I turn around  And this guy's going in  By the scruff of the neck  And he's like  You guys want to fuck with me?  And he slammed him  Against the UPN 9 satellite  They're losing their minds  Yeah  They really are  Getting a little touchy  About these things  Not happy at all  I was hoping that guy would call  I don't know where he is  Yeah  Alright  We'll get him on later maybe  What costume are you going to wear tonight?  I am coming as the black sheriff 
[01:24:00]  From Blazing Saddles  Alright  Oh  That's good  Of course he is  He's going to be in blackface right?

[01:25:00]  Hey  Did we find the broadcasting cable thing?  Printing out right now  We're printing it out?  Oh  Alright  Because they got it all wrong  This whole assault on the media thing  What did they say?  Now you've piqued my curiosity  Here it is  Ooh  This happened one week  Than  Thank you Than  Hot off the presses isn't it?  Indeed  I don't like how this order gets me the page last now  Alright  And there is sometimes Than  That will be chit chatting with Jim  As he's  As I'm waiting for copy 
[01:25:30]  It's true  Here we go  Whole show is held up  This is why we don't have much respect for the media in general  Cause they get everything wrong  Wow Alert  By John Eggerton  Broadcasting and cable  Ugh  We understand there are some local TV news directors out there concerned that XM Radio  Shock  Shock  Shock  Open Anthony are targeting a new wow campaign  Whip it out Wednesday  What?  No you fucking homo  It's  Whip um out Wednesday  And it has nothing to do with wow 
[01:26:00]  That's a separate thing  Right  Unto itself  Right  And it's whip um out  Oh brother  Not whip it out Wednesday  That means we're encouraging guys to whip out their cocks  Don't make us explain it  Maybe you want to see cocks John  But we don't  We understand that  We understand there are some local TV news directors out there concerned that XM Radio  Shock Jocks  Open Anthony are targeting a new wow campaign  Whip it out Wednesday  Toward their remote news broadcast  Uh the pair banished from Infiniti's New York station for a contest promoting sex in public places 
[01:26:30]  Has long encouraged listeners to get naked in arguably inappropriate places  What?  We  We  We never did that  Where are they getting that from?  Well  There's been a couple of instances  But they're  They're kind of melding a bunch of things together  They're making it sound like that's all we're doing  The pair banished from Infiniti's New York station for a contest promoting sex in public places  Has long encouraged listeners to get naked in arguably inappropriate places 
[01:27:00]  Including flashing truckers who are better left to concentrate on the family sedan in front of them  Family sedan  And a notable breast bearing on the Today Show  Concentrate on the Packard in front of them  The family sedan  Concentrate on that Edsel  At press time we could not independently confirm the concern  But in the wake of the FCC's crackdown on indecency  Broadcasters have a low threshold for surprise exposure to fines and possible license revocation 
[01:27:30]  We'll keep you posted  But news people may want to keep an eye out for people with trench coats  Zip-up blouses  Velcro closures  Wrap-around skirts  Kilts  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot  They're being funny  Then the article just kind of fades away  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot  Don't they understand it has nothing to do with nudity?  This has nothing to do with nudity?  The attack on the media? 
[01:28:00]  Assault on the media?  It's just getting in the shot  And yelling something like, you know  O&A, Party Rock  O&A, XM Satellite Radio  The nude thing  It's not nude  It's just girls flashing their cans  At guys that have W-O-W on their vehicles somewhere  That's the WOW campaign  The encouraged listeners to get naked in inappropriate places  Seems to be a tie-in to the Sex for Sam thing that we used to do  Got us in big, big trouble, Buster 
[01:28:30]  Well, there was that time we asked Danny to moon everybody on Fox News  Yeah, that wasn't an assault on the media, really  They had a live camera  Oh, no  I'm sorry  I'm totally distracted now  By the news  What is this?  The Today Show?  Yeah  It's Halloween  So they're all dressed up  Wow, Katie Couric looks just like Marilyn Monroe  Katie's just like Marilyn Monroe  This is why I will not be wearing a costume tonight  I was just reminded why I'm not dressing up  Matt Lauer  I thought there was a new promotion for the new Peter Jackson film 
[01:29:00]  Oh, you are an asshole  I guess Matt Lauer is dressed as Batman  Right  And what was that other costume?  Al Roker  Al Roker hat on  I didn't know Robin was a name  Was it Rob?  The black guy is Robin  How perfect  What in the lower Mississippi  Dadgummit, Robin isn't  Okay  Well, they looked ridiculous 
[01:29:30]  Is he Robin?  No, that isn't Robin, is it?  Is he a power?  What is he?  He's just a superhero  None in particular, I don't think  Got to be  He can help us out  I can think of one  Don't think of it  What?  Not Batman  You want to think of black superheroes?  No  No  Spawn  I think he might have been Spawn  Yeah, that's exactly what Jimmy was thinking 
[01:30:00]  Yes  He was Spawn  Something like that  What?  That is a word  Very inappropriate  Someone is saying that's Robin from Batman Forever  What?  It is?  I guess  What's he got dangling by his dick?  What is that?  Well, next we're going to actually check out the costumes  Here on the plaza  I look like a middle-aged Marilyn Monroe  Just like I looked like a middle-aged Mary Poppins last year, right?

I haven't talked to him in a while  We know he's  Been on vacation 
[01:34:30]  I know he's firing people left and right down there  Did he fire anyone?  Oh, my God  When we go back down to Washington to the compound  We're not going to recognize anybody  Who is he firing?

Giving him the home version  No longer with the company  Yeah, yeah  And the home  Yeah, giving him the home version  It's great  The BlackBerry lights up  And he basically says  Do not contact this person anymore  Yeah  You ever notice that?  On your BlackBerry  In your emails  You'll see one from Elo  And he'll be like  Oh, this is important  Let me check this out 
[01:35:00]  And you look at it and says  Such and such a person  Does not work for XM anymore  Do not contact them  Any questions?  Call me  Eric Logan  The Terminator  He's a scary guy  To people, you know, that aren't us  I guess  We just kind of laugh at him  Even though he is the boss  You don't see him as the boss  Because  No  We don't really  He's not bossy  I don't see him as the boss  He's never bossed us around  He has made suggestions 
[01:35:30]  He takes our input  Things like that  But he's never said  O&A, you do this  I'm your boss  And until he does that  We still laugh at his bad haircut  And  No, his haircut's gotten  Has it?

[01:43:00]  Sex offenders are living in your neighborhood  Just ring on all the doorbells  And see who doesn't answer  See who's not allowed to answer  Because last year it was  Who answered the fastest  Like  Like  No  I'm here, don't go away  I'm here, you're kidding  Here, here  Come on  Pat from Munaki is suggesting  You can find the pedo's house  By looking for the peepholes  That are two feet up on the door 
[01:43:30]  Very funny, Pat  From Munaki  I think we have  And wait a minute  Now, am I to understand  That they're inviting these people  To some type of get-together  I don't know  At a precinct  We were too busy laughing  At this horrific story  We were laughing too much  To listen to what the cops  Are actually doing  Let's re-listen to the audio  I think we can get a little more  Out of this  Alright  And then we got another  Another clip we gotta play  Okay  It's the New York 
[01:44:00]  Civil Liberties Union  Of course  Of course they are  And a serious part of the story  Well, come on  Of course they are  Some pretty creative measures  In Westchester County  Level 2 and 3  Sex offenders will receive  An invitation to a Halloween  Party in the mail  However, the party  Will be here at the probation office  And it's an educational program  If they don't show up  That knock they hear on the door tonight  Won't be trick-or-treaters  It'll be the cops  It's a way to keep kids safe  In New York  Some 800 of the worst 
[01:44:30]  Most dangerous sexual offenders  Have been ordered to obey a curfew  Starting at 3 this afternoon  And running until 6 tomorrow morning  It's much the same in New Jersey  The 2,200 sex offenders there  Must be indoors by 7 tonight  They cannot open their doors  To trick-or-treaters  They cannot go door-to-door  With children  And they cannot go to Halloween parties  With children  Westchester County  Has sent letters to sexual offenders  Asking them to attend  A special educational program  Those who don't attend tonight  Will get a visit at home 
[01:45:00]  From probation and police officers  Officials on Long Island  Will be making similar checks  Alright, so they have to show up  How frustrating is that  Like the doorbell's gonna be ringing  The little happy voices outside  And you're gonna be against the door inside  Just listening and jerking off  And you're gonna look like Mark Wahlberg  When he's detoxing in Boogie Nights  Remember when he's got his head on Annette Bening's lap  And he's just crying and sweating  How embarrassing is it to show up  At this little party  This little soiree they're throwing  For the sex offenders  Because now you gotta show up 
[01:45:30]  All in the same room  Looking at each other  Yeah, I'm one too  Hey, I don't know  How are you?  Do you have to go in a costume  You think?  Yeah  It's Halloween  They kind of make it sound like a party  Make them all wear goofy costumes  Oh, is that horrible  You can probably only dress up  In certain costumes  If you're a sex offender  That's probably the rule  I would think  You know, nothing  Nothing child  Related  Yeah, like if you paint  Your whole body  Like a candy machine  And you paint a Snickers wrapper  On your penis  That's probably  Against the rules  As far as the police are concerned 
[01:46:00]  All right, Mars is telling us  That the phones are working again  Okay, fine  Mad Mexican  All right  Mad Mexican on line two this time  What line is he on?  Two?  OB  Because he's been calling on one  Mad Mexican  Hey, are they on again?  Can you hear me again?  I wish we could hear him  Right  No  Hello, hello  Yeah, I'm here  I don't know  Hello  Mad Mexican  Hi there  Can you hear me?  Is it two or one?  Line two?  Yes  Can you hear me on that? 
[01:46:30]  Push down line two  And  Mad Mexican  Hello  Can you hear me now?  Hello  I'm not getting anything  There's something there  I hear something  It's not a deadline  Why are we wasting time?  Come on with the phones  I don't know  You don't want to be rude  Why are we wasting time?  The guy's a bore  No, I wouldn't do that  He's messing with us  And we're falling for it  Every time  Yeah  I'm messing with you guys  You know, if he thinks  This is a funny joke  You know, to be calling  And not talking  We have other things  To get to  What's that supposed to be? 
[01:47:00]  Some kind of sick joke?  No, I'm here  I wish the Mad Mexican  Was getting his head  And his ass wired together  Or I will  Take a giant shit on him  Or you'll send the punisher  After me  Hello  It was Julianna Moore  In Boogie Nights  Oh, okay  According to Scary Uncle  From Philly  I'm sure he's right  And I'm wrong  And that's Benny  How old am I?  And someone's saying  That all those sex offenders  There'll be an entire room  Of guys dressed like  Ice cream men  That's a hell of an image 
[01:47:30]  That's a popular costume  You want a good humor?  Alright, here we go  We got the second clip  On the side of the truck  It says removal of all humor  Oof  Oof  Wow  I'm glad you don't have  A flip down the embankment  Sound for that one  Here we go  The second clip  The New York Civil Liberties Union  Is questioning the various plans  It has not gone to court  But there is open debate  About the effectiveness 
[01:48:00]  And legality  Of such crackdowns  Are we in fact  Protecting our children more  By not having treatment  Up front and continuing  And having these  Very media publicized  Restrictions  I think the answer is no  So police say  The best way to keep  Your kids safe  During trick-or-treating  Is just to go along  With them  Now for young teenagers  Though who don't want  To have mom and dad along  Make sure they take  A cell phone  And check in often  Yeah  Those teens  Alright this is getting ridiculous  Smell my feet 
[01:48:30]  Give me something good to eat  Mad Max again  Hey I'm getting ready  To start the show guys  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Again?  It's not working again?  Man!  Man!  It's not working  It's not working  Hello  What an ass 
[01:49:00]  What a complete ass  Thank you  I really wish we could get him back for one more  Guy just wants to wish us a happy one year  Tugging his uncut chain  Actually the chain doesn't move  Just the skin over it  Like you pull  And a foot of skin comes down  And the chain remains the same  Oh it sounds like a fruit roll  I'm being peeled  That's lovely  Fucking disgusting Jimmy 
[01:49:30]  Let's say hi to Mike in Michigan  Mike  Hey boys how you doing?  Hey Mike  Hey Mike  Hey  Hey listen I got a friend  The registered sex offender  When he was 16 years old  He apparently had sex with a 12 year old  Well it wasn't discovered for a while  When mom found out  Mom had him prosecuted  At 17 he went to jail  For five years  He'll have to register for the next 25 years  As a sex offender  He's 27 now  And  Been out of jail for five years 
[01:50:00]  And this is  You know there are some guys  The high level ones  I think that's  You know  This guy's defending his friend right here  He's calling up  And he's actually defending him  Like hey  I am defending him  Yeah because he was 16 years old  16 and he had an affinity  For 12 year old girls  She was going on 13  Yes sir  12 year olds typically are  You're telling me  That you weren't tapping anything  Young when you were  When you were in school  I think I gave up 
[01:50:30]  The 12 year olds by 16  Yeah  I did  By 15  You gave them up by 16  By 16  I had given up on 12 year olds  If you're 16  And you're like  Fucking 12 year olds  You'll probably carry that over  Yeah  You know  You probably have something  Already starting there  That  Well if you  If you met this guy  If you knew this guy  You'd sit there and say  You know  You got fucked  You got fucked  That's a big age difference  I mean 16  You're already hitting puberty  And stuff  And the 12 year old girls  Yeah 12's a little rough  Yeah and when you're 22 years old 
[01:51:00]  And you see some 18 year old hottie  Coming up to you  You guys see it out  Yeah but  That's fine  That's fine  And the 18 year old has reached puberty  I think it's all about the puberty thing  Dude if you're 50 and she's 17 it's fine  No she's not  No it's not  Sure it is  18  Oh 17's fine in some states  No there's only a few years of difference  All I'm saying is  Don't bust every second  Yeah but sir  This is what you're trying  You seem to be trying to make a point  That if the guy is one age  And she's four years younger  That's a difference 
[01:51:30]  If all of a sudden  They're different  Oh no Jimmy  I know there's a big difference  I know there's a big difference  No no no  But that's not what I'm saying  And 16 and 12  No no no  But the point I'm making  Is that what about  Like you know  Like all of a sudden  It's a few years later  So you're saying  That you're supposed to add  That five years to the four  And it doesn't make any difference  All I'm saying is that  No no no no no no  It was consensual  And he  Look look  No one's arguing the point  That some 12 year old girls  Are some real sluts  Good point  Good point  But you know  We have to protect them 
[01:52:00]  From themselves  Had to be said  There you go  All right Mike  There are some hot  Whore bag 12 year olds  There are there  But you know  It's not for us to  What an asshole  Mad Max again  Hey how's it going  Mad Max again  Hey what's up buddy  Hey what's up  I wasn't ragging on you guys  Something's wrong with the phones  That's not my thing  Yeah  Well we got the phones working  You're about to start your show  On what channel  On XM 92  You're going to give us  A big intro today  Oh but of course  All right  I'd like to hear that  And finally  We got you live  On the show

[01:58:30]  Like I knew I was going to do  Certain fat tit jokes  And it was weird  It was just like  I knew I had to just  Get through this shoot  That I could start losing weight  It was a real weird thing  And I just was like  Okay I'm done with that  And now I'll start working out  And once again  Don't even for a second  Make it sound like  You knew you had to do  Fat tit jokes  So like an actor  No  That took the role  You gained weight  For your part  You and De Niro  Yeah  De Niro  It was  De Niro  Going to the same acting school  I knew I had to do  The fat tit jokes  So I grew these big fat tits 
[01:59:00]  Right  And then  Alright I'll accept that  I mean I really am trying  To come off like  I'm some kind of a fucking  I did it for my art  When the bottom line was  I just like cookies  Alright I'll accept that  Fat titted fraud  It was almost like  What a pompous explanation  That was  Almost  And then I decided  Then I decided  For this role  You look very good  Let it be known  That your pal  Opie was going to  Let you slide on that one  I was nodding my head  And going with it  It was  Anthony

[02:00:30]  That sounded a lot  Like toilet in there  A couple times  The Mad Mexican  That's how he started  His show  I like how he starts it  With the  What was that  Speedy Gonzales 
[02:01:00]  Probably the most hated  Racist character  In cartoondom  He starts with that  God bless him  Let's see  Derby day  From New York City  Most heard line  At the penophile  Halloween party  Hey you're wearing  A clown costume too  Yeah  Let's see  A lot of people commenting  That you fucked up  The Annette Bening thing  Oh yeah I know  We remedied that 
[02:01:30]  It was a mistake  Gee whiz  Can't you make a mistake  Without people jumping  All over you  It'll only be repeated  A few times today  Hey well you know  What I say to that  I mean look  If I make a mistake  Oh boy  Oh no  No  No  We should not do that  What  There's some things  We don't miss  About Jimmy  Yeah well good  You know  Let me tell you something  Bill Burr  Never farted  Into that microphone  He can't  He fucking queefs  Comes out the front  Quiet  It smells like raspberries 
[02:02:00]  Bill Burr is in  Young man  Alright  Let's be comfortable  Enough to fart  Sooner or later  Everyone gets comfortable  Enough to cut gas  I don't  When you feel the power  Of that microphone  By your asshole  You can't not do it  I don't  You haven't actually  We gotta  We gotta play something  For Jimmy  Ooh  Macht das Spaß? 
[02:02:30]  Du Hühnerflicker  Ja  Ja  Ich bin ganz wild  Auf dieser Hänge  First time  Ja  Ja  Ah  That's good  Ja  Gleich  Gleich  Ja  That's a man 
[02:03:00]  Who'll be  Not opening his door  For Halloween  This evening  The old chicken fucker  Ja  Ja  Das gut  Das gut  Ja  I speak a little German  Not much  But in the beginning  She was saying something about 
[02:03:30]  How atrocious was your childhood  And he was saying  Worse than you can imagine  That is awful  One of the things that came in  Since you've been in L.A. there Jimmy  That horse that fucked that guy  And killed him  Struck a blow  Oh yeah  For every one of these poor animals  That has been fucked by some awful German  It's always some German video  I don't know what it is  I'll tell you what it is  German and Japanese  Are the most vile videos  And the reason is  Because once your nation  Loses a world war  That you started 
[02:04:00]  It does something to your psyche  Years later  Does something to your psyche  You have to  Even years later  You have to go to a farm  And have sex with a chicken  Or  We can't kill Jews  Let's fuck animals  Is that what the German mentality  That's exactly what it is  We can't  We can't  Slaughter people anymore  As the Japanese  Let's  Let's  Shit in each other's mouths  But block out the pubic hair  Because that's somehow immoral  Fucking associate pimps  Yeah I always found that a little odd  They're just awful  None to show  The pubic hair  They're not happy 
[02:04:30]  Unless the woman is crying  They love the fucking  Because they all have little dicks  They love that  Dominating and hurting a woman thing  You fucking rotten  Sexless people  And you've seen them all  I hate them  I cannot watch those movies  Really?  That is terrible  I've just seen a couple of the  Bukkake videos  Yeah  Where they  It's just a load of  Load  And it's all over the girl's face  And then in a cup  And she's drinking it 
[02:05:00]  And a big snifter  A brandy snifter full  That's the worst is  When a girl's in a drinkable  Bukkake load  And she'll like  Shake the glass a little  And it goes  I'm trying to talk to you  And the load is milky  Almost like something out of an egg  And she shakes it  And it will go up the side of the glass  And it comes back down  And it stains the side of the glass  Like eggnog  Hello exactly  Right  It really is like she's drinking liquidy  It's like egg whites and snot  And the girl can't enjoy it 
[02:05:30]  She can't enjoy coal  Out of a glass  Of course not  Out of a hog  It's got to be awful enough  Anthony  Anthony from upstate New York  I'm assuming  Can't listen to the show anymore  Anthony why not?  She heard the chicken fucker material  The other day  And the first couple times  I don't think she really understood it  But once Anthony started  Breaking it down  Doing the commentaries  When we got in an argument  Later on that day  And she said  Oh by the way  That's disgusting  I can't deal with that 
[02:06:00]  I don't want to hear that anymore  For your wife?  Yeah  That's alright  Yeah so  The wow thing  You know she used to always  Bust my chops about  But after Anthony's chicken commentary  She heard the replay of that  And she didn't really  Yeah you can tell right  When the chicken gets it  Is the best part of that whole thing  Because he's just being a chicken  Sorry  He sounds like he's crying  The chicken  He's just  And then you hear  Yo rock it on  You know when that Aryan hog 
[02:06:30]  I thought it was  The Mad Mexican show starting  You know what  You know what I feel worse for  Than anybody  Who ever did the soundtrack for this  This is a guy who had a dream  Of being in a music  Having a music career  And he's doing the fucking  Background music for a man  Fucking a chicken  Hopefully scoring a musical  On Broadway  There it is  What should  What should the  What emotions  Should be brought out  With my music  Right when he fucks the chicken 
[02:07:00]  I think the trumpet  Yeah rewind that again  I think I might have  A little something  For this part  Now this piece  That I've written  Right  I had more of a goat in mind  With this  But I think it works  With a chicken  Let's take a listen  Like it really  Macht das Spaß?  Du Hühnerflicker  Ja 
[02:07:30]  Ja  Irre  Ich bin ganz wild  Auf diese Hänge  This is a giant cock  No that's good  Ja  Gleich  Sounds like it's crying 
[02:08:00]  Yeah  That is a sad chicken  You picture that chicken  It's almost ready to go  Hey a bat  Poor confused bird  Really bad  The other chickens are like  We got it easy  They're only going to behead us  And then eat us  This poor fella  Because you know  That's what happened next  They probably killed it  And ate it 
[02:08:30]  Oof  Yeah I hope  Because we heard about  That farm up in Washington State  Yeah  That people went to  It was kind of a  They knew they could go there  And have sex with animals  Were they using these animals for food?  Were they making it to the markets  Where we buy our chicken?  No of course not  No?  How do you know?  How do you know you didn't eat some chicken  That had been fucked maybe?  Because you can make more money  If the horse is alive  The horse  But first of all  People don't eat horses  I'm talking about a chicken 
[02:09:00]  A chicken die  I'm just talking about animals in general  I mean you keep  You know  They're worth more alive  Some  Not a chicken  You've got to think  You've got to pay a fee  You can't just go on the farm  And do this  Yeah but  You can get fresh chickens  This is America after all  You don't want a stretched out chicken  You get the chicken  The German has sex with it  You ship it off to market  And you buy  A new tight chicken  Yeah but you try to get a few  Out of the chicken  Before you send it off  To the factory  A few  How cheap  Could sloppy seconds be 
[02:09:30]  With a chicken  That has got to be  The most discounted price  Ever ever  You let the Asians  Screw the chicken first  Oh you have like a  And then you work up to Tyrone  And then after Tyrone's done  Then you ship it off to  Off to market  Off to Purdue  One thing black people don't do  I gotta say  Is they don't engage  In animal fucking  You don't see  Deviant sexual behavior like that  Some deviant  But you don't see  Typically a lot of like  Really filthy BDSM  Or shit movies  Or chicken fucking  You don't see the black people  Doing that stuff  Skinny white guys  Yeah  Black people will fuck

[02:11:30]  Beehive hairdo  Frosted  Frosted  And she had a very  Sixties look  A lot of mascara maybe  I don't remember the mascara  But very matronly  You know who her face  Looks like  And this is before  I knew who the woman was  Anyone that remembers  Aunt Peg from porn  What?  A lot of guys  Know who I'm talking about  Her name was  Juliet Anderson  Aunt Peg  And this is  I never knew who  Aunt Peg was  When I was a kid  But her face  Resembled  Aunt Peg's  A little bit  With a bouffon  Hairdue  That would be  A good description  Of Helen  Like a big bun 
[02:12:00]  Type hairdo  Yes  And was she wearing  A sensible dress  I don't remember  How she dressed  I don't remember  I can only picture her  From the chest up  So chances are  It was a photo  Of a woman I saw  Yeah  Probably mother  We should get  Steven here  Because we have  Laszlo audio  And we love  The Laszlo audio  Remember this one  He sent in to us  Hoo hoo  Robin  Hoo hoo  Robin  Hoo hoo  Hoo hoo  Robin  Robin  Hoo hoo  Robin  Right Robin  Tell him Fred  Tell him Fred  I invented everything

[02:13:30]  To accomplish  But yeah we work  The magic of the internet  It really is  And did housework  Worked on my house  Worked on your house  I did  Now how is that disaster  Coming  It's not actually  No I didn't  I was supposed to go  To Florida  But we were scheduled  To go right  As the hurricane hits  Oh everyone  Panic  Hold on a minute  Hold on a minute  I know exactly  What you're going to say  We were  Anthony flew to Florida  I flew to Florida  When did you fly though  Friday afternoon  I flew Saturday  You stayed down there  Like didn't you go 
[02:14:00]  On a cruise  Or something like that  No  I stayed in Orlando  You did  And they said Orlando  Was pretty much going to be  Closed at one point  They were a little scared  Oh great  We had all our little  I had my little  Disney poncho on  And we were trotting  Through the magic kingdom  I was supposed to go  To my mother's house  On the west coast of Florida  And fly back  Oh I heard that  That was completely destroyed  I had  There was nothing  You're a panicky Pete  I wasn't a panicky Pete  I had perfect timing  Scared Steve  I flew  What were you  I flew into Miami  As Wilma  As Wilma was barreling down 
[02:14:30]  Barreling down  I got into Miami  The next day  They closed Miami  In the airport  And everything else  You make it sound  Like you're the last plane in  And it's biting the tail  Of the plane  I'm not even kidding  They closed it the next day  I was close to the last plane  So roughly 8 or 10,000  More flights came in after you  I was close to the last plane  Out of Miami  They landed in the eye  Was it  Pretty close  Was it like the plane  Taking off  In Independence Day  It was less than  The airport  Everything just  Anthony  It was less than  Less than 24 hours later 
[02:15:00]  They shut the airport  For a day or two  Yes  Yeah  I just got in  Just got out  Less than 24 hours though  That's hundreds of aircraft  I say that's pretty brave  That is not brave  It sure is  Don't get this false  I had weather maps  And everything  I was like  Googling  And Google earthing  And all sorts of stuff  Were you tracking the stars  I was tracking  With Doppler  I had my thousand  Million  I had my Doppler god  And I was  You did not  I made it just in time 
[02:15:30]  Everyone now  With their god damn  Hurricane stories  Enough  And then I flew down  To the Grand Cayman Island  And thanks for that secret  Grand Cayman Island  What?  They don't want the rest of the world  To know that Ivan  Did a number on that island  Oh really?  Their tourism bureau  Has got to be brilliant  I think their slogan is  At least we don't kill  Your white chicks  They got their own problem  Because Ivan did a number  Last year  And they don't want people  Around the world  To know that  What is it? 
[02:16:00]  Just nothingness down there?  Just ravaged?  There's a lot of destruction still  Sure  Yeah  Yeah they're rebuilding  A lot of the island  A lot of the island  Don't most of the islands  Down there look like that?  They just look like that?  It's called poverty?  Well not  Hurricane poverty  Came through here  For the past hundred years  I've been to  People don't even know  What a wheel is  I've been to a lot of the islands  Down in the Caribbean  And the Grand Cayman  They're doing okay  Yeah  They're not as poor  As some of these other islands  Oh Bahamas  Nassau's not doing bad either  If you hang out in Atlantis 
[02:16:30]  Place is lined with gold  It's wonderful  I drove  I drove the island  Yeah  Of Grand Cayman  One day  Because I went down there  To dive  And can't really dive  When the surf's 15 feet  And higher  Really?  When they're just used  To a little ripple effect  Oh yeah  I mean the water down there  Would it get a little  Like stirred up?  Stirred up  Oh my god  It was like  Sludge  It was like 10 foot waves  No problem  For two or three days  Yeah but that's on top  When you're diving  But they couldn't get  The boats in  Oh  I was down there for a week  I finally started diving 
[02:17:00]  On Thursday  Yikes  And I had to leave  Saturday  So I didn't get many  Many dives  Don't you have to  Like you can't dive  And then fly  Yeah like 24 hours  24 hours  Something like that  Yeah  Depending  Depending on all sorts  Of math  Any fights with any  Foreigners underwater  Nah  No Frenchman  Duking it out  Cutting his arrows  Not this time  Not this time  But  Grand Cayman Island  I toured the island  I drove a car  On the wrong side  How big is it? 
[02:17:30]  It's  It's big  It's big  I don't know  I don't need  Absolute dimensions  But you drive across it  In how long?  You could do the whole island  In a big circle  In like an hour  Oh really?  Okay that's it  But it's on the other side  Of the road?  You tried that?  Holy crap  I won't even  Give it a whirl  It gets really confusing  No way  Stop signs  Traffic circles  And then they got  The little like  They don't have like  Square intersections  A lot of times  It's a lot of merging  Into things  Right  And if you're on the  Opposite side  They call them giveaways 
[02:18:00]  Giveaways  Or something like that  Giveway  Giveaways  Giveaways  Giveaways  Or something like that  Yes  When you were down  In the Cayman Islands  Did you happen to see  A young lawyer named Mitch  Hiding while Wilford Brimley  Chased him?  Dude  Wherever  Wherever you went  I went to a restaurant  And they sat us at this table  And they said  Tom Cruise sat in that exact seat  Really?  And I went  Big deal  Wow  And there's 50 other people  Who overheard it  And going  But he must have eaten here a lot  It's in my seat 
[02:18:30]  Wherever you go  This is the house  That was featured in the firm  Tom Cruise stayed here  He ate there  Yeah  Oh my god  That's  The movie's what?  1993  Yeah  That's their big claim  And the guy who did the music in it  Is the same guy that did the chicken fucking music  It's the worst music in movie history  The worst  But you go to the other side of the island especially  And wow  It's still a disaster zone  Like you see like  Really nice houses  And mansions  That are completely just blown away man  No one rebuilt them?  Problem is  You don't have enough workers down there 
[02:19:00]  And then getting the materials on the island takes time  So there's like kind of a waiting list for people to rebuild  Almost a year later  You'd think someone would jump on that  You would think  Like it's a business opportunity  Oh there's cranes  And there's construction crews all over the place  But not enough obviously  Oh it's going to take a while  It's going to take a while  I'm going to invest in that  And I've got to get a picture up on  Sounds like a good investment  I've got to get a picture up on opiumentity.com  I passed a house  You know  They don't like looters obviously  We learned that with Hurricane Katrina  Yes  And all that 
[02:19:30]  And they have signs on their houses  That are waiting to be rebuilt  Looters will be shot  You know the deal right?  But I saw this one house  It had three or four nooses  Really?  Hanging in their front yard  As a sign like  Stay out  No looting  I would fuck with this house  If I was you  Type of thing  Wow  Serious  And then we jumped in the water  Because the waves were like  10-12 feet high  You know  And all the people  I was staying at the Hyatt  They all started gathering  Their beach chairs  To watch us in the water  Because there's nothing to do 
[02:20:00]  If you don't dive in the Caymans  There's nothing to do  It's just scuba  There's really nothing else to see  Except the dumb turtle farm  And you can pet some stingrays  In Stingray City  That's about it  Yuck  You go there to dive  Really  Yeah  So these people were bored  And we're in the surf  And they couldn't believe  We were in the surf  So they're just gathering  Their beach chairs  To watch us  And talk about us  Saying how crazy we are  When it's like a regular day  At Robert Moses or something  On Long Island  With the big waves  That's all it was  When did you go to the Caymans?  Saturday  Just got back Saturday  Just got back Saturday  I don't go with the big waves 
[02:20:30]  You don't mind  Very scary  Why?  The big waves  I like it  Nice  Resort-like  Flat water  Yeah  Blue  You can see the bottom  I should  I should get Kenny on the phone  No club soda Kenny  Sidecar Kenny  Did he come?  No  You know  I hate traveling and stuff  And that's not my thing  So I  Just like when he does our trips  He picked me up  And got me checked in and stuff  Do you believe he's using him as his boy?  No I pay him  But  Did  I pay him  He sets up the whole trip 
[02:21:00]  He's unbelievable  Okay  But you had him come to your house?  He  He's like  You want me to come?  And I'm like  Alright  Well  He insisted kinda  But what did he  What did he do?  He just showed up  Showed up  Grabbed my bags  Helped me pack  Oh my god  Help me pack  Cause I don't pack till the morning of the trip usually  Yeah we all know that  When we go on group trips  Oh is that what you're doing?  We're all sitting in the van outside the apartment  With the luggage  All our luggage  Packed a week before  And Opie  Oh what?  Yeah I just had to throw a few things together 
[02:21:30]  It's like being in school  And you have that big test  I  When I was in school  I waited till the last minute  It's the same with this type of thing  Yeah but everyone  Is just sitting there  Waiting to hand their papers in  Because you haven't yet  I understand  I understand  It's very selfish  But I've tried  Is it cakey?  Hi Bill  How are you?  I've  I've tried to pack the night before  It just never works  So I get up early  I got up at four  And I started packing  And side cars running around  Helping me out  And I woke up  What happened?  I don't know  I don't know why I have two 
[02:22:00]  You got two cakey things?  I didn't ask for two  Well someone's got some explaining to do  Why are there two cakey things?  Yes?  Yes  Well they didn't have anything at all  That was non-blueberry  Except these two things  So I just flipped the billboard  And you can see which one you like  Do you know that this is perfect?  It's apple and cinnamony  And delicious  It's exactly what I described  As what I wanted  What is this? 
[02:22:30]  I don't know  That's the coffee cake  So you just got lucky with this then?  Yeah  Those are the only two  Non-blueberry cake things they had  He got both  You don't like blueberry cake?  You're not going to be able  To take it back though  Blueberry cake is excellent  I'll take whichever one you don't want  Or you can have both  Because I flipped the bill for it  You did not  What do you mean you flipped the bill for it?  Why are you paying?  Two bucks  You know what?  Anthony makes a million times out of month  I would rather pay two dollars  Do you know how much I've made in the past  What?  A couple of hours we've been on the air?  I would rather pay  You'll never see it in a lifetime my friend 
[02:23:00]  I'd rather pay two dollars  And not screw up  There you go  And I threw an extra buck in there for you  Attaboy Ant  Way to take care of the hell  And take the cake  You can take the cake  Wow  Hey Bill  Thank you  That's right  And you can eat it  Bill  Why  If you can't afford bread  Let him eat cake  Right  Psycho  Lunatic  Yeah  I will tell my  He's going to eat it  Like with the paper still on it  Just staring straight ahead  Just chew through the little  Paraffin  Is that what it's called?  Paraffin 
[02:23:30]  Paraffin?  No  You put paraffin in like  Stuff for your  Like face paint  Wax  Yeah  And it's explosives in England  Oh  Who believe?  Maybe it's what dolphins have  Because  Because Bill has beautiful timing  I will tell my puke story another day  Why?  I'm listening  Oh  That's where I was going with this whole thing  But I'll have to tell you another day  Damn it  Wait  So did Kenny  Another day  Hopi  What happened?  I don't even remember where I was at  Kenny  Comes over your house 
[02:24:00]  Packs your bags for you  I understand the story was boring  But it was going to have a fine payoff  Packs your bags for you  Don't remember  Calls up the  Doesn't even  What do you say to Kenny?  I think  I think he has the call  Kenny  Caimans  Hopi  That's it  That's it  Yeah because  And then he calls you  Back  And has everything set  Because  When it comes to this radio show  I have a lot of responsibility  And have to do a lot of dumb things  So in my personal life  I don't like doing all the dumb things  Dumb things? 
[02:24:30]  That's  It's a trip  Huh?  You just book the trip  I can see having him book it  That's a smart thing  Side car  Side car  Yeah  Hi  Hi Kenny  How are you?  Kenny will be at the Halloween party  At the Hard Rock Cafe tonight  Yeah  I like to call him side car  By the way  Why is that?  Are you wearing a costume?  I'm going to wear my birthday suit  Is that alright?  You better be  That's what I do now  So I told Kenny 
[02:25:00]  I wanted to go diving  In the Cayman Islands  He set up the whole trip perfectly  I can't do that  I don't know how to do that  I don't even know how to begin  I just see him diving in front of you  With a big spear gun  Just in case anything  Yeah  Nuzzled you  I killed the shark  For you Opie  He got me at the  The Hyatt down there  It was great  The whole thing was great  Except for the weather  That he couldn't control  And he was bummed out  That the weather was bad for me  He's working on that  I'm sure  See Kenny at the end of the island  With a fan  Trying to blow the storm away  Trying to get a butterfly 
[02:25:30]  To flutter over Africa  To start the storm wave  A lot of people  A lot of people advise  That I don't go to the Grand Cayman  Why?  Island  And I did anyway  Because of the hurricane  Hurricane Roma  But Kenny did a great job for me  What's wrong with that?  And then I give him a few bucks  For helping me out  Because I can't do this type of shit  So Kenny came to your place  And then just went with you  To the airport?  Yeah  And did what?  And got me checked in  All you gotta do is walk up  And go here's my ID  And they go  Alright go up there  Yeah but then you gotta  Then you have to pull a bag 
[02:26:00]  And everything  Well honestly  I was on the fence  I'm like  Kenny you don't really have to  You know drive me to the airport  And then he was kind of insisting  And I was like  You know what  It is a nice luxury  Did you get the golf cart  Through the airport?  No no no  No you guys are missing  The best part of the story  What?  That's all boring  I understand  No I'm fine  So Kenny  Why don't you describe  What you saw  When you arrived at my apartment  Well I don't like to give out  Intimate details of your personal life  Intimate  Alright  But you know 
[02:26:30]  I always welcome the opportunity  To see greatness like you  And your lovely lady friend  Yeah  And you know  When I got there  At four in the morning  I you know  Helped you pack as usual  Right  I have nothing packed  And clothes all over the apartment  Why so early?  Kenny  You booked the flight  Why so early?  No it was a 7 a.m. flight  Because then he had to get to Miami  And had to you know  Change planes to go to Grand Cayman 
[02:27:00]  Where did he fly out of?  He knew work on American Airlines  Because Jimmy  Your airline don't go there  No I know  I'll accept that  Jimmy Air doesn't go there  Oh yeah  I'm having a big problem with  By the way  But we'll get into it  By the way  Kenny  Yes sir  Never book me on American Airlines again  Oh I'm sorry  I went into the bathroom  And they had a razor dispenser  Yeah  Just showing how old the plane is  So you could shave in the bathroom still  Uh huh  This is when this plane was built  You could shave in the bathroom 
[02:27:30]  And then you could dispose of your razors  They had an actual slot  Your razors are disposed here  And then go back and light up a Lucky Strike cigarette  Your ashtray is in the armrest  Ashtray in the bathroom  Thank you Anthony  I realized I forgot another  That's great  And then there was something else  I forgot  Knock on the cockpit door  And say hi to the pilot  And he'll show you around the flight deck  Right  No more American Airlines  Because I think those planes  Might be a little old for my needs  Okay  Yeah  Holy crap  I was thinking to myself  How old is this plane 
[02:28:00]  If you could dispose of your razors  In the bathroom  Some pretty old  Well sometimes they'll use older interiors  Inside of a plane  That has actually very good working equipment  That's not always an indicator  Is that what they're lying to you?  No no no  But I've heard  I know what I hate  They were showing Seabiscuit on the way home  Which I saw already  I didn't need to see  But what scared me  Was the announcement  From the cockpit  Saying that  We're having some technical problems  With the audio visual system  And you know that's all fine  But you shouldn't say that ever  Because then 
[02:28:30]  What are you thinking  As you're in the air  Wires burning somewhere  They can't see it  Yeah  And you're thinking  What else is going to go wrong  Yeah  Because this seems to be  The easiest thing  That you can make work  It's bad enough  When a plane goes down  Because like  Total hydraulic failure  They can't  An engine explodes  But when a plane goes down  Just because you wanted to watch  A fucking movie  Like there was a flight  And it turned out to be  The entertainment system  The whole interior and cockpit  Filled up with smoke  They couldn't see shit  The plane crashed 
[02:29:00]  They all just like died  And they tracked it down  To the friggin' VCR  And the wiring  That went to the various television sets  150 dead people  Because somebody wanted to see  Stuart Little  Exactly  Like it's one thing  When you know  The friggin' fuel line broke  Watching a movie  I could do without the movie  Get me there safely  So sidecar shows up at 4  Do you want me to talk now?  Yeah, go ahead  Sidecar  And then I was summoned  To fetch him vitamin water 
[02:29:30]  At the corner store  Alright, you know what  You gotta  Vitamin water  I know you're trying to protect me here  But you gotta tell him why  I was a mess  What was wrong with Opie?  He was drunk  He was bombed  You were still drunk?  Wait, you think I was bombed?  Yeah, he was out of his mind  Staggering and stumbling  Through the apartment  Holy crap  First of all  Now I'm mad  I might have had too much  To drink on Friday  I'm not really sure 
[02:30:00]  Yeah  Because I had to go get  My back waxed  But that's  Oh, hold on  Alright  What a creep  Hold on  Hold the phone  Yes, I realize  I'm throwing myself  In the barrel right now  Barrel?  When did you get  Your back waxed?  Well, I have a  I have a very lovely girlfriend  And I want a very nice  Presentation when I go on vacation  Right  So I figure I would  Groom a little bit  Groom a little bit? 
[02:30:30]  Okay  And us Huses have been known  To have some  Some hair on our backs  Uh-huh  In some places that hair  Shouldn't be on the back  Where?  Kind of like on the sides  And stuff  Yuck  Like there's  Like he would have said something  And it could have been something  You went  Mmm  All awful  Back hair is atrocious  I'm sure you look good though  With your nice smooth back  Vomiting into a bag  On the plane  That way when you lean forward to pukes  You can see  Wow, at least he has no hair 
[02:31:00]  Between the shirt and the belt  Listen to me  Because now he's saying  I was drunk  I think I might have been  Hung over, Kenny  But four in the morning  Is still the next four  But now I'm starting to think  It was  It was  I got some kind of food poisoning  Yeah  No  That was  Yeah  No, I'll explain  Wait, bad grapes in the wine?  Fry the wine  So Friday  Backing up  I decided to  To look  Have a nice presentation  Uh-huh  So I went and got my  My back waxed 
[02:31:30]  At some little Asian place  It's always an Asian place  Holy shit  The next time I do it  Next vacation  I will get audio  Because it's  Does it hurt?  It's brutal  Absolutely  Yeah, I did it  I'm dragging him into the  No, it's okay  I was  I'll walk in  This guy right here  This big bear  Gets hair ripped off his body  Almost on a daily basis  No, it's not  It's not ripped off  I tried waxing it once  But it bleeds too much  So I went with the laser  That's because he has quills  I do  You don't even have hair  It's like quills on your back  I do  I have  You can sell the strips as Velcro 
[02:32:00]  I have the worst  After they peel them off  They try to wax  They try to wax his back  And skin and everything  I have the worst genetic makeup  For anybody who doesn't want to be hairless  It's awful  Why do you ever take it off?  Tired of getting honey and bees  Exactly  That is  Exactly why  So yeah  I tried waxing it off  But it bleeds  Your pores bleed  When you yank it off like that  Not your pores bleed  My pores bleed  No, yours do  Because I don't have that  I didn't have that much  Where it was going to be 
[02:32:30]  That type of a problem  So I  That's great  Some trapper has a big wagon  Full of the strips  That they  Take off of Steve  Trading them  Or wampum  Horse's ass pelt  Wait, who else gets their  Someone else around here  Gets their back waxed  Or gets some hair removed  Yeah  And I'm sure she  Has a vagina  Exactly  I heard Ben went  And he got his liver waxed 
[02:33:00]  So Friday  Friday I knew I was going  To the Asian lady  To get the back waxed  Yeah  And it really fucking hurts  It really fucking hurts  The pain I'll probably  Never know  Nope  And I decided this time  That I needed to like  Numb the pain  Without a doubt  Oh is that  Is that why you were drinking?  So I had a couple drinks  Before I went in 
[02:33:30]  On Friday  Alright  And then I went out to dinner  And I had a bottle of wine afterwards  So I probably had  Four or five glasses of wine  Is that a lot of wine  That's enough  You think it's enough?  Yeah  I know it's enough for me  It was enough to make me puke  On my vacation  Alright  What did you have for dinner?  Well that's  I went to this little like  Place and I had like  Before dinner  I had like  A bunch of like  Marinated olives  That's good for wine  And what else?  A whole bowl of them  Wow  What are you a cat?  Did you roll around 
[02:34:00]  With a paper plate  On the floor?  I had this weird craving  For a nice  Healthy bowl of olives  Olives?  All marinated  With little red pepper  On them  And I don't know  That's a snack  For like  The 1940s  In Cuba  Where's a bag of chips  Or something?  Did you enjoy your olives  While you were passing around  That solid gold phone?  We're bigger than  U.S. steel  So  This is where  I'm a little mad 
[02:34:30]  At Kenny  Because Kenny  Even though I got  The wine  The olives  More wine at dinner  I was still in bed  By a very  Very good hour  There  About 10 o'clock  And I woke up at 4  So I had 6 hours  Okay?  I apologize  I was trying to be funny  But you know  That's not easy for me  All right  So  I wake up  I wake up  And I got  The cold sweats  And I go in the shower  And I'm in there forever  Taking a hot shower  Going oh my god  What the hell  Is wrong with me? 
[02:35:00]  I'll be honest with you  I would admit  If it was  Too much drinking  I think you had  A severe hangover  You think?  Yeah  Maybe you didn't realize it  Maybe it didn't mix well  With the food  So maybe it wasn't  Just a hangover  Five glasses of wine  Is plenty  To have a huge hangover with  From like  Five?  All right  Whatever  So all right  Maybe I was hungover  And you're stressed out  You know  You got to travel  You got a fucking  Belly full of greasy olives  And what did you eat for dinner?  I don't remember  Was it seafood?  Was it?  Steak and potatoes  I don't remember  I was too drunk 
[02:35:30]  Oh yeah  It was like  Some steak and potatoes  Thank you  Sidecar  Didn't you see it  On the way back?  Coming back up  This gets a little better  So sidecar is running around  Realizing I'm in deep trouble  We got to leave the apartment soon  I can't function  I am in  I am like dizzy  I want to just go back  To bed  I got a headache  I'm sweating  I'm like  What the heck?  It's a hangover  All right  And so I'm just throwing stuff  In my bag  It was a nice surprise  When I got to Grand Cayman  When I packed  I'm like  Oh I packed this shirt  Cool  I had no idea  No idea 
[02:36:00]  I had to buy all sorts of stuff  When I got there  Because I just forgot stuff  Ah  And we get into Kenny's car  And we start pulling her away  Right Kenny?  Yeah  And we didn't make it  To the end of the block  You know where I live right?

[02:36:30]  And I go staggering to the back  I find some parked cars  I hold on to a bumper  And just start puking  Like I haven't puked in years  Just power booting  All over the place  Was it fluidy  Or was it like food too?  It was  Toe curler  It was  Toe curler  Yeah  It was  It was very  I was thinking of  Pat from Wiennake  Actually  Because it sounded  A lot like this  Just the gurgling  And it was just like  It was like  Chopped up food  And a lot of liquid  Moiny Mr. Beckfest 
[02:37:00]  Steve took his headphones off  You can't listen to that?  Something about that sound  Really gets me  I don't like it  That gurgling  So I'm holding on  To the bumper  This is how I start  My vacation jazz  I was puking  And I was thinking  At this point  Maybe I'll just like  Leave Sunday  But then I knew  Wilma was coming in  I knew I had  Only one shot  To get to Miami  I'm serious  About that  And it was also  Lindsey's birthday  We were traveling  On her birthday  So I'm like  Oh my god  This is not cool man  Not cool  So we get back  In the car

Well why not?  I like to  It's nothing felt  With being drunk  Wait maybe the olives  Came in a fucking glass  With a little bit of  Clear fluid in them  Yeah  Floating  With a toothpick through it  20 olives

[02:47:30]  I've drank more that night  Than I drank in years  What'd you think?  And I was hammered  At first  I wasn't that drunk  So I was singing things like  Desperado by the Eagles  Midnight Confession  And then I confessed  Just, you know, karaoke song  And then I'm hammered  Going, put on some Maroon 5  You didn't  I have no clue  It was Nickelback  And then Nickelback  And then, like, I was just  I'd try anything in the book  I didn't care

[02:59:00]  Just take it  They're scary looking though  They are awful  But they're just so  Docile and awful  Yeah they don't do much to you  But they're scary  What's this Richard Simmons  Audio we got  Anyone know  Richard Simmons  Talking about  He will cry  On his serious show  God the little doggy company  Just making such  Great great hires  I gotta tell you  It's too compelling radio man  I gotta tell you  Martha Stewart has become  A complete bust  And Sirius committed  A lot of money to her  Is she on already?  Her TV show is tanking horribly 
[02:59:30]  Yeah  The Apprentice  No one gives a fuck  About Martha Stewart  And that stupid company  Hired her for a  Multi-million dollar contract  Even the Donald is angry  Because he says  It's kind of funneling off  Viewership from his show  Yeah  I'm sure the stockholders  Are very happy over there  That they're paying all that money  To someone that  No one cares about  Seven million a year  Is it that much?  I thought so  Holy  Am I wrong, Hawk?  Nice  Holy shit  When do we get to renegotiate?  Good luck to you  I'll say  Oh my god  Anyway, here's Richard Simmons  Talking about his 
[03:00:00]  Satellite radio show  Every time you fry something  You're helping your child  Get to a grave  Richard Simmons is back  In front of an audience  But this time  He's also behind a mic  E.T.  Every time you see me  I'm crying  I cry every day  And it's gonna happen  On this show  And I think it's okay to cry  And if you cry  Four hours in a row  You lose 80 calories  The show is his new  Weekly three hour  Call in Confab  Sundays on 
[03:00:30]  Sirius Satellite radio  It's called  Lighten up  You know  Lighten up your body  Lighten up your attitude  And begin to see  The light in your own life  Wowie  How about  Lighten up your fucking units  So people can buy them  And carry them around  You jerk off  Oh my god  What irrelevant nonsense  It's irrelevant  Dreck  Richard Simmons had  He had his day  Yeah the 80's  He was popular in 87  Yeah  Every hack comic  Did their Richard Simmons joke  Did you? 
[03:01:00]  No I wasn't around in 87  Would you have?  Probably  Yeah of course  Please  I said that fucking in Connecticut  Chunky Monkey was called  Obese Primate  And thought it was funny  I was fucking heinous  Did you put on that voice?  Yes  That was the rich guy voice  Oh  You think I just made that up now  To make it funny?  It works  He rewrote it on the fly  Historical  Well good luck to that other company  We also  We also stole  The Fox News radio channel  From them right?  No more Fox News  Crap over there? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah their radio  Fox Radio  Fox Radio  We took away from them as well  Wait  So they're not going to have it next year?  No man  I don't think so  No  Well why would you want Fox?  I mean they don't do any ratings  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  You know  Martha Stewart's good  Fox is bad  Martha Stewart  Fucking idiots  Except I'm obviously making the better deals  Of course  Overall  And they gave me a raise  Which guarantees that I don't go over there  Oh  Because Martha Stewart was looking for a sidekick  Yeah  That's right  That would have been a perfect match 
[03:02:00]  That's right  The Jimmy and Cunt show  A little too abrupt  Alright why don't we  Take a break  So maybe we can catch  Stalker Patty on the Maury Poe show  Oh we want to see that  We're very distracted here  So Derek  Take his wife a little bit here  Let's see how this comes out  Alright  They're right there  Alright here we go  I got a break  I got a break  I'll put it off  Oh this is nice  This is a story about a man

[03:04:00]  Maybe those people are so poor  Some of the people who do that  They're so poor  They've never touched anything in their lives  Let them touch those things for one  All together now  Let them touch those things  Let them touch those things  Don't, don't, don't, don't take things for once

[03:05:00]  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program  I'm Drew Boogie  From the other day when he was spinning live in the studio for us  Very busy day  We got Jim Norton back in town from L.A.  He's here all this week  And we got the Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe tonight  Yeah  I see a lot of people starting to show up  Are they here for the day already?  I don't know  I see Donkey Sausage 
[03:05:30]  And Doug Out Doug  And Big A  And a bunch of other people outside the studio right now  And the other thing happening today  Stalker Patty's on Maury Povich  And I think right after the commercial she's going to be on  Which is a pretty big hit for the radio program  Without a doubt  Of course  Let's see what's going on here  We love Maury, by the way  He does great radio  He's been a victim of a peeping Tom  Nerd 
[03:06:00]  Knockout  Here we go  I think this is the Stalker Patty  This is Bette  And for the past 15 years  Bette's been in love with this man  His name is Chris  He's sexy  Now Chris is proud  Alright, they don't get Stalker Patty yet  They're nerding those people  Of course they are  They really are  He's got a dildo tied to his chest  It's not the way this guy normally dresses  I see Brother Joe in studio with your uncle, Anthony  Yes  Your long lost uncle that I've heard about over the years 
[03:06:30]  Many stories over the years  Many stories  First time we're meeting him in the  I don't know, since I've known you  Quite the fun experience growing up with Uncle Joe  Uncle Joe  Remember the up hot stories from many years ago?  Of course  I used to tell when we used to live in East Islip  And Uncle Joe came to live with me  My mother, brother, and sister  And he was cultivating a garden in the backyard  And my sister sort of like had me watch you guys  Like I was doing a good job 
[03:07:00]  Yeah  It seems like I was just too young  I was not the person who should have been in charge  No  She was the mother, like single mom, you know  So she would work and go out  And while she was out, Uncle Joe would watch us  But it wasn't really watching  We were more watching you  As we were growing up  There was something  He had like an apartment in the house  Right, it was in the basement  It was kind of in the basement  I put up a wall  Yeah, there was a wall 
[03:07:30]  I put up a wall  But there was some kind of like frosted glass thing  That was between the kitchen and his apartment  And he had put that in  And there was a gap  No bigger than a little keyhole  That you could like look through  And we used to peek through at the parties  You used to have down there  And they're just  I mean it was your definitive late 60s, early 70s  Hippie pot smoke party  You know  And me and Joe were peering through  Little did we know though  The kitchen light was behind us 
[03:08:00]  And just like shown these silhouettes on the glass  So they would look up and see us looking  And I just remember seeing this blob of like clay  Just go right into the hole that we used to watch  And he was like growing pot plants in the backyard  That had to be  How tall were those things?  Oh, they were giant  The small ones were 8 feet  The big ones, the ones that went above  I carried stalks around for like the next 5 years  It was like wood, it was bolts of wood or something  But the big one, I know it's hard to believe 
[03:08:30]  Was just about 20 feet  20 feet high pot plants on Long Island  And that's not the way to grow it  You know, I mean that was my first try  You know, I thought I had a green thumb  It wasn't the way to grow it  But when I tried to chop it down  I got an axe  And I hit it with an axe  A sharp axe  And the trees went  And I had to go in and get a saw  And I'm sawing down these things  It was like a giant Christmas tree  I can really see why they're grown for bulk  In one season  These things grew  They were just one row thick  And I couldn't see out 
[03:09:00]  You know, I couldn't see past them  Yeah, very bushy  Very tall  And our neighbor  Our next door neighbor  Was a cop  Was a cop  Yeah  They'd get power over you  That's the thing  Later on  That was the first time  But when I grew after that  I grew indoors  And the plants take control  Like you can't  Even though you say  My God, I'll go away for 50 years  But you can't chop them down  They just  They have control  It's like  You ever see that movie  You know  Invasion of the Body Snatchers  They're like friggin' pods  They take control of you  You just can't  And then when you go into a room 
[03:09:30]  Of just female plants  It's like  You have no control  You've lost it  You know  It's a bizarre thing  Unbelievable  What were you saying  What were you saying  The other day  About you didn't grow from seed  After that first plant  Oh yeah  No seeds  No seeds  You had to clone them  How would you grow  Wait, what?  Oh yeah, you cloned them  You don't  This way there's no  Genetic drift  Wait, how would you clone a plant?  Well, you see, the thing is  You want it  They call it  They call it a mother plant  What you do is 
[03:10:00]  You find the best plant  And you look at it  With this little 30  30 magnifying loop  And you count these little  They look like little glass things  That stick  It looks like a glass wonderland there  And they're called trichomes  And these little balls  They're like glass balls on the top  That's the only part  That really has THC in it  And it's so funny  Because everybody used to smoke  But no one knew  You know  They used to think  That the drug was in the leaves  And stuff  It's just on the top 
[03:10:30]  That like icing  Sort of looks like sugar  You know  That's the stuff  You know  Yeah  You know what I did  When I was living with you  Right  I was juicing  Remember I had the Norwalk juicing  Uh huh  Yeah, this was something  That was like sold  It was almost like a  To make juices  But you could also  Freeze bananas  Yeah  And make like banana  Frozen banana dessert  And it had a press on it  That was like the press  From the Terminator  That the Terminator  Got caught in at the end  And you could press juice  Out of anything  That's right  And I pressed juice  One time out of weed 
[03:11:00]  Out of the leaves  The big pot plants  He decided he was going  To make pot juice  That's it  Drank a couple of shots down  Didn't get high  But put a seatbelt  On the toilet bowl  It was so intense  Cleaned me right out  You know  I remember that  You were like almost crying  That your asshole  Felt like it was going  To fall out  I was clean  You know  But there are interesting  Things that you can get  I used to manicure them  You know  Manicure the buds  Yeah  And the scissors  I had these teeny  Cute little scissors  A whole bunch of them  Because they used to like  Stick  After a while  They globbed up 
[03:11:30]  Because of all the trichomes  And just one time  By accident  I just  It wasn't an accident  But I just took all  The stuff off  And did a hit of that  And I found out  That that was pure hash  That was absolutely pure hash  My eyes went two slits  Two red slits  Boom  One hit  I couldn't breathe in air  I was paralyzed  I had to fight  To get that first breath back  Just from the scissor gook  Oh yeah  Then I learned  And I used many scissors  And just gook them  It was fun 
[03:12:00]  The same weed by the way  I cleaned out  Uncle Joe's seed collection  When I was about 13  And rolled up a big fat one  And smoked the whole thing myself  Three days later  I called him up  Asking if I was ever  Going to feel the same  Again  That's true  You know I'm surprised  I feel horrible sometimes  When I think about  You know  How horrible  I mean  It was weird  Take  No matter what I did  With you guys  Seems like it was  Either wrong  Remember when we went  To the movies  I took you to this  Horrific movie  Oh my god 
[03:12:30]  Thinking  I'm going to go out  With a kiss  I drink your blood  I eat your skin  Or something  I eat your flesh  I eat your flesh  It turned out  To be a cult  It was like some cult movie  About bikers  That injected meat pies  With rabies  And fed them to people  And turned them into  Like these zombie rabies people  I got to go to the phones  A lot of comments coming in  Lee in Philly  Go ahead  Hey what's going on guys  Hey man  I want to say that  Ant's uncle sounds  Just like Woody Allen  I swear  Really?  Have you ever heard  Of Woody Allen?  Maybe  No have you ever heard  That you sounded like Woody Allen?  Oh no  I haven't heard 
[03:13:00]  That you act like Woody Allen  But  Bubba the trucker  Bubba  Hey  Hey man  Yeah I was wondering  If that was  Ant's uncle  Or is that Woody Allen?  Another Woody Allen  Wow  Woody Allen's coming in  It's Woody Allen  Ant's uncle  I've heard that  I've heard that  My ex-roommate Vinny  Said that  Yeah  He said  Well Brian in Rhode Island  Has another one  Brian  Yeah  Hey  His uncle  Sounds like  He was tied to the pier  At high tide  Saul Rosenberg 
[03:13:30]  Sounds like  Saul  Saul  Saul Rosenberg  He looks young though  Uncle looks very  Like 28 years old  Very young looking gentleman  That's right  Uncle's  Petrified  It doesn't look like  You're much older  I know right  How old are you now?  56  Wow  He's 56  I know  56 right  That pot does some  See what that weed will do to you  That pot does some good things  Back in the older days though man  He did  He was growing these plants  And my mother  My father came over once 
[03:14:00]  And said  What the fuck  Are these pot plants doing  Growing here  You know  There's a cop next door  They're going to take the kids  Like my father freaked out  And my mother looked at him like  You idiot  It's a basil oregano hybrid  That he's growing  I was such a liar  I can't believe it  You told her that  You were growing a basil oregano hybrid  But I did have an organic garden  And I did pay off our neighbors  With good organic produce  On both sides  And I figured  That would be enough 
[03:14:30]  Yeah  He had a huge  He like  And we never had a yard  Like he tilled the entire backyard  And just planted in it  It was vegetables and pot  Stalker Patty's up next  All Patty back  She's up next on Maury Povich  On Maury  Do we have time to take a quick break  Or do we have to get any other breaks in really?  No not really  You can do whatever  Alright  Will a miracle makeover get her a mate  Is the slug line  Fucking awful  Burn victim lips  Is this it right here? 
[03:15:00]  On to Maury's show  Okay  There's just a commercial  And we used to do horrible things as kids  But it's just things kids do  And one thing I remember is  And especially if you were stoned  This would like break all the rules  Obviously we had to share a refrigerator  And Uncle Joe loved  As we all did  Our ice cream sandwiches  Big box of ice cream sandwiches  Very nice  And they would just  Nothing like that would last in our house  Between me, Joe, and Dawn  We would just eat these things in one sitting  And that's what we did 
[03:15:30]  But to even make matters worse  We would leave the empty box  Wherever it was  Whether it was cookies, ice cream  It would end up in there  So Uncle Joe must have been  You know  Craving ice cream  Right  Craving  Craving  You smoke a little  You just think it  And it pops in your head  Holy shit  I have ice cream sandwiches  That's it  Now you're just like  It's your mission  Goes up there  Opens it up  The box is in there  Grabs it  It's empty  Empty box of ice cream sandwiches  We're just sitting  Watching TV  So he does  I guess the only thing 
[03:16:00]  He could possibly do  He had so much anger  He just grabbed the box  The empty box  Threw it at us  And went  You bummers  And walked out of the room  That was the angriest  He's ever been  In his entire life  The angriest  I've ever seen him  You bummers  It was a bad trick  Leaving the empty box  It was  I thought there was ice cream  It was very bad  Did that justify  That kind of language  I don't know  I don't know  You going to the party tonight  I may  Yeah may sure  Are you going to make an appearance  Do you still smoke pot 
[03:16:30]  I don't know  That's a good answer  No one says yes  To something like that  I'll take the fifth  But taking the fifth  Means that you do it anyway  That's a smart answer  Anything with no  Is a yes  Right  I don't know  And brother Joe  You got to head to the hard rock soon  Yeah pretty soon  Yeah we're going to sound check  We're doing a seven camera video shoot tonight  Really  Seven cameras  Yeah I had to clear it  With a whole bunch of people  But it's going to be the new demo  The hell are you  Seven cameras  It's like big time now

[03:32:00]  Don't let them  It's only a matter of time  Before they get sucked into a vortex  Of shame  Drugs  And pornography  From which they'll never recover  The internet  It's just not worth it  This message brought to you  By Citizens United  Negating technology for life  And people's safety  That's gonna be on GTA  The PSP version I believe  One of the fake commercials  Huh  A little preview  Of one of the fake commercials  On GTA  The PSP version 
[03:32:30]  There it is  Liberty City Stories  Is this different though?  They make it a little different  In what way?  They put in some differences  Yeah  What's different?  I don't know  I don't think it's as detailed  As the last version  Simply because it's on a smaller platform  I could be wrong  Right  Well that would be a good thing  To then just wonder about  Hmm  I think it's not as good  But  No no no  Not to say it's not as good  It's a different game entirely  But I don't know  Like I don't have a PSP  Do you?  Ooh  No I don't  Yeah  See I don't really know

Yeah  What does Ben do for the game?  Ben's got a credit on that goddamn game?

Don't, don't, don't  Herky and jerky  Herky and jerky above Liberty City  You can't  You can't hone in on him  Yeah  He keeps like dodging your shots  Right  Ooh  Open it up Hawk  Let's see the credits  There really was a reason why  Ben is in the credits  I didn't open up the game myself  You know that right?  You wanted to re-wrap it  Thank you Hawk  Did ya?  I kinda didn't want mine opened 
[03:34:00]  You wanted to give a gift?  Yeah  I wanna re-wrap  Yeah  Thanks Hawk  Who are you gonna give it to?
