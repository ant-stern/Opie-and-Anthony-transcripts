<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, largely centered around their recent appearance on Bill O’Reilly’s "The Corruption of American Children" segment.  The show began with a detailed dissection of the edited footage, highlighting how O’Reilly selectively chose provocative snippets—like references to "luscious boobs," the Olsen twins, and instructions to listeners to "get some lube"—while omitting the more nuanced parts of their conversation.  Opie and Anthony vehemently denied any responsibility for the show’s potential impact on children, repeatedly emphasizing its entertainment nature.  This discussion was interspersed with numerous instances of crude humor, homophobic and misogynistic slurs, and anecdotes about a producer’s drunken behavior during the O’Reilly taping.  They also mocked O’Reilly, highlighting his past work in tabloid television and implying his outrage was hypocritical and performative.  The hosts and crew reacted to and played back segments from the O’Reilly appearance throughout this portion of the broadcast.  No guests outside of the regular on-air staff were explicitly mentioned in studio during this section.


The broadcast then shifted to a discussion fueled by a misconstrued Onion article about women comforting each other with showers, which one host mistakenly presented as a personal confession. This led to a conversation about their tactics for boosting ratings, including a planned "Lesbian for a Day" segment. They defended their actions by claiming to be "artists," but acknowledged that money was "kind of cool."  This transitioned back to criticism of O’Reilly and his perceived bias and use of their show for publicity, with callers—including Tom, who expressed concern about the show’s influence on children, and Frenchy, who used highly offensive language—offering their opinions.  The unexplained absence of a regular segment participant, Earl, became a running comedic bit. Several rambling and highly offensive calls followed, from Jim Bob and Big Willie, who engaged in bigoted and sexually explicit statements. A prank caller pretending to be a customer service representative also contributed to the chaotic atmosphere.  The show then launched into a highly critical discussion of their radio program director, Dave, with predictions of his imminent dismissal and dark humor about listener reactions.  They announced there would be no April Fool’s prank that year due to oversaturation, recalling past pranks.  A seemingly intoxicated wrestler, the "Grease Man," also made a brief, chaotic appearance.


The following segment began with discussions about Carl’s Mencia (a potentially planned, but absent guest), college basketball, and a Sam Adams beer advertisement. A listener called to express intense dislike for Opie and Anthony, making derogatory comments about their appearance.  Lady Di and Marion then arrived in studio, engaging in banter with the hosts about weight loss, clothing, and plans for a night out, frequently using sexually suggestive language and descriptions of their bodies and attire. Carlos Mencia called in, using crude language and humor to defend Opie and Anthony against O’Reilly's criticisms,  also commenting on his own comedic style and O’Reilly's hypocrisy. This was followed by sexually explicit jokes, commentary about physical appearances, and racially charged humor and stereotypes.  The "Oz game," where callers guessed the next line from HBO's *Oz*, ensued. This involved several callers, with the hosts and Marion providing commentary and crude jokes. The game was frequently interrupted by humorous asides.  The segment ended with the continued "Oz game" and mention of a caller wanting to make a “6 o'clock queef” sound on air.


The final segment featured a continuation of the *Oz* game, with callers guessing lines from highly offensive clips, filled with homophobic slurs. Incorrect answers resulted in exaggerated reactions from the hosts.  John won a first-season *Oz* DVD.  This transitioned to the "Who's Getting F'd?" game, also using *Oz* clips, where Tim from New Jersey, guessed which *Oz* character was engaging in sexual activity.  Confusion arose from a misleading audio clip.  Tim also won an *Oz* DVD.  The broadcast concluded with a promotional piece for Jim Norton’s motivational tapes, filled with self-deprecating and vulgar humor. Opie, Anthony, Thinner Steve, Awesome Garrett, and Marion were present throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Feeling low? The best way to not feel like a worthless douchebag is to listen to an even bigger piece of crap.  I am awful!  With the Jim Norton motivational tapes, you'll feel better about yourself instantly.  I stink!  Hate your body? Take it from Jim.  I'm a meaty-breasted little nothing.  It could be a lot worse.  This sucks.  Problems at work?  I effed up an ABC audition today.  Hey, at least you have a job.  Everything I do, I look like the Manchurian candidate.  You'll be amazed at how much confidence you have after you listen to a mushy little nothing tool on himself for hours on end. 
[00:00:30]  Shut up, chinless.  I'm nuts! Almost 13 years I'm doing comedy.  God, there is no justice in this world. It sucks.  You have the warmth of a trout.  What a retard I am.  Does anybody not see the disgrace in this?  Everyone loves Jim's inspirational live appearances.  It's a night of pale, meaty-breasted dullness.  Coming to a town near you.  I'm Margaritaville.  I don't sing ever, you idiots.  Stay tuned for details.  Just f***ing listen to the station and get tickets, you douchebags.  Love yourself.  Hate him.  I suck.  With the Jim Norton motivational tapes. 
[00:01:00]  That's me, Jim Norton, folks.  Ugh.  I love that one.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  I...  I...  Day.  Cancel your appointments.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!

[00:02:00]  It's too hot.  I love you guys.  I feel like I've known you forever.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh, Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  Too good for every boy.  Oh, who's all doing? 
[00:02:30]  You stupid faggot.  Hey, man.  Stay fearful.  She's my hair, pot boy.  Hey, get your bitches back in the kitchen.  And make me some pie.  Oh, old school.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get late.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Ha-ha.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't want to get the tracks, fellas.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  There you go.  Yes.  Yes.  What is Dan from Hoboken saying right off the bat?  Well, Dan from Hoboken says, it's three o'clock, time for ONA to start pushing their wares on us.  You're pushing your wares on people.  What's with the national phone line screen resolution problem we got here?  What do you mean?  It's only on mine? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Look at mine.  It's jumbo size, and I'm only getting half of the phone.  Oh, really?  What the hell is that?  I'll fix it.  I'm good with stuff like this.  It's a computer.  It's a computer magic.  Man, it seems like a lot of people are listening to us today for some reason.  I wonder why.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you remember saying half that stuff last night on Bill O'Reilly?  No.  No.  And not in that context.  I thought it was okay. 
[00:04:00]  Considering.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Mike, it was done a long time ago.  I know that much.  Done end of the summer.  Last year.  Ants in my head.  And was bigger than an elephant.  I swear it was this big.  Thank you.  I have more Olsen twin stuff to screw me up.  All right.  I don't know where to begin. 
[00:04:30]  Those bitches are going to kill me.  I swear.  So we'll start from the beginning, I guess.  We were on the O'Reilly special last night.  The corruption of America.  Yes, the corruption of the youth of America.  It was the corruption of American children.  Child.  What?  Of the American child.  Corruption of the American child.  Pompous Bill O'Reilly gets out there.  And for the next hour, you see more naked women, hear more foul language, and see more violence than anywhere else on television. 
[00:05:00]  And I learned that, you know, there's another website I need to go to, whitehouse.com.  He told everybody.  He was telling the children.  That was like the most erotic hour of TV I've seen in years.  And if you're trying to find the White House, don't go to whitehouse.com.  Oh, okay.  You've got to go to whitehouse.gov.  You go to whitehouse.com, you're going to get porno.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right, Ms. Cleo. 
[00:05:30]  You're going to get porno.  But he did preface the whole show, Opie, by saying that if you have young children, send them away.  Don't let them watch this.  But if you have children that you feel are of an age that can watch this, sit with them and discuss.  What a fuck of ass, you hypocrite.  It's not like you're watching some kind of after-school special or something.  He puts a little thing on the screen that says, the following program, blah, blah, blah, just so he can feel good about himself. 
[00:06:00]  That he himself, Bill O'Reilly, is not corrupting the youth of America.  That show, like every other show on Fox television, is made to sensationalize and titillate, if I may use the word, titillate, Opie.  And that's what they do over there at Fox.  I don't fault them.  Try watching their goddamn news.  It's hysterical.  One after another, they editorialize, they sensationalize everything that happens in the news. 
[00:06:30]  And it doesn't stop when they have their shows like the O'Reilly Factor on the Fox News channel.  I mean, it's this guy.  And, you know, it's an act.  Don't let him fool you.  You know, it's an act.  It's like he's the upstanding guy.  You know, I've heard some pretty wild stories that involve a Bill O'Reilly.  That upstanding guy, if you remember, before the interview said, hey, I would like to come on your program and discuss my latest book. 
[00:07:00]  Remember that, Anthony?  Yes.  You do my show, I'll do yours type of thing.  His first book involved stories that were pretty racy, too.  Oh, you got a couple of pretty racy stories in that first book.  Wait, what?  Exactly, Butters.  So, you know, it's an act that he puts on.  It's worked very well for him.  He's making a lot of money.  He's going into radio.  I mean, God bless the guy. 
[00:07:30]  But don't even try to make it sound like you're some champion for America's youth and you're exposing these things that are detrimental to America's youth.  He even said it himself right at the top of the show.  He goes, most stories have two sides.  This one doesn't.  And then you start off that way and try to make it sound like you're going to have a fair and unbiased broadcast by saying there's only one side of the story and it's mine. 
[00:08:00]  Jesus Christ.  Right when I saw that, I'm like, oh, we're in for some trouble.  And Bill, nice editing, dick.  Yeah, yeah.  And then when you edit programs, which, you know, it's fine.  I don't care.  I thought it was fun.  I think Bill O'Reilly came off like some guy that's trying to criticize fish for being in water.  You know what I mean?  We absolutely know what we do on this program.  We know what it's about.  The people that listen know what it's about.  And there is no making excuses for it.  I'm not going to sit there and make excuses for it. 
[00:08:30]  This is an entertainment program.  We entertain millions of people on a daily basis.  That's it.  Now, Bill, go ahead.  Your turn.  What's he going to say to try to make us seem stupid or irresponsible or foolish?  We know what the show is.  We love doing it.  And we have an audience that appreciates what we do.  And we feel no responsibility, no civic responsibility when we do this show.  I do not come here on this program and think, how am I going to make the world a better goddamn place? 
[00:09:00]  It ain't happening.  As Dan from Hoboken writes, none on us.  None on us.  We need none on us, more better, more gooder.  None gooder, more better, good on us.  So I tune in Fox a little early because, you know, I want to see, you know, what type of job we're going to do on the special, right?  Yeah.  And then you sit through that very, very erotic story about the woodchipper murders.  The woodchipper murders beforehand.  The show they had on Fox before the O'Reilly program that was on was fantastic. 
[00:09:30]  I loved it.  I sat through the whole goddamn thing.  It was about murders that took place and how they solved it with forensics.  Yeah.  Fascinating.  The guy that killed his wife by bludgeoning her over the head.  How many acts of violence were in this scene?  Put her in a meat freezer, froze her solid, hacked her up with a chainsaw in manageable pieces,  then went over to a river with a woodchipper and shoved her body parts through the chipper  where they were able to identify her from her teeth. 
[00:10:00]  And at one point the dentist goes, oh, yeah, her head went through the woodchipper.  Like, goddamn, this is the best show on television.  But where's Bill O'Reilly to say how awful this is?  Shut up.  Dan from Hoboken.  So far this week, Anth has gotten in trouble for a threesome and the Olsen twins.  Too bad it's two separate incidents.  We're going to get to the audio.  Amen, Dan from Hoboken.  We are going to get to the audio.  There is some great radio to do today, man. 
[00:10:30]  And my mother thought, you know, maybe this would make up for the Time article.  No.  Well, you know, the Time thing you said about the Olsen twins.  But, you know, this is national television.  Let's see what my boy Anthony says after last week's newspaper debacle.  And I do believe at this point you have an obsession with the Olsen twins.  I do.  Who the hell's denying that?  I was holding out, but after last night, you're on your own.  You know something?  I'm not going to sit here and deny that.  I'm kind of like Daryl Strawberry's wife.  Hey.  Yeah.  There's not much more I can do over here. 
[00:11:00]  I am completely obsessed and fascinated by the Olsen twins.  You told the national audience last night to get their lube.  When I'm sitting watching that TV show, I'm sitting there and I'm on mic telling America to grab the lube and start cranking out a batch.  Make sure it's a good lube, I think he said.  I was on my couch.  I was leaning forward.  Because like we said yesterday, we really didn't remember what we said because it was like seven months ago. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I was biting my fingernails, leaning way over, waiting for the phone to ring because I knew you were watching, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Going, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.  When are we going to look stupid this time?  But you know what?  I got to say it.  I think we did all right.  Yeah.  It was fine.  You know what?  I think out of everyone, we didn't do too bad at all.  Well, I think we fared fine.  And the reason, again, I'll say it, it's because we were not trying to make excuses for this show.  We know what it is.  It's entertainment.  And there was no backpedaling. 
[00:12:00]  It was like, yeah, this is what we do.  Do you ever, Opie, on a daily basis, come in here and your primary goal is to make the world a better place, to help the children, to do anything more than make people's drive home better?  And if that, in some way, shape, or form, prevents a murder from happening because some guy goes, eh, I chuckled today.  I won't kill today.  Hey, fine.  That is what I'm thinking when I come in here.  You know?  And on the other hand, I'm not thinking that a kid is going to listen to this show and turn out all effed up. 
[00:12:30]  If it happens, hey, ain't my problem.  We're here to entertain our target demo, which isn't children.  And if we weren't here doing this, we'd be doing it in the bar down the street with our friends.  There you go.  They just happen to pay us to do this.  Yeah.  They pay you?  Well, you do it for the money, do you?  Yeah, obviously, Bill.  You are mercenaries.  Mercenaries?  I've been called that.  How much money did Bill make on his little special last night?  Yeah.  That's why it's so hypocritical.  The editing, brilliant job, too. 
[00:13:00]  At one point, Opie Picasso over here, the artist of the two, you could see some of his works hanging in the Louvre.  Do you work in charcoals, Opie?  Or pastels?  I'm missing an ear today.  Did you cut it off and send it to a chick?  Yeah.  Opie.  Opie Van Gogh Hughes.  We're artists.  But you notice how it was edited?  Yeah.  We're artists.  We're artists.  We're artists.  And then you go on to, they cut and go on to say something about some girl's luscious, luscious boobs. 
[00:13:30]  Wow.  Is this your art?  That's what it's like.  It's like, yes, we're artists.  And then they don't show us maybe sitting here spontaneously volleying back and forth a news story in a witty fashion.  No, they have a clip where it's, he went, luscious, luscious boobs.  That's art.  What is that?  Watercolor?  A paint by number? 
[00:14:00]  Right from the beginning, he goes, this is all they're about.  Right.  And this is all they're about.  Hey, man, we love the TNA.  No spinning here.  We know the TNA gets ratings and stuff.  But if we were doing that every single day, we wouldn't be as successful.  Just, it's hysterical.  The way he said spinning, you know, at the end, at the end of the show, when he goes, and I'll be back and give a little commentary on this.  And it won't be spun in any way, shape, or form, you know. 
[00:14:30]  Unbiased.  Unbiased.  He's incapable of unbiased.  Because you know what they did with us and everyone else that appeared on that show?  So, they had their film crews film us ahead of time.  Yeah.  So, they could catch us doing some of this crazy stuff.  So, then Bill could ask the question, knowing he's going to put this clip in.  Right.  Right after our answer.  Yeah.  Which is great.  You know, whatever.  Thanks, Stephanie.  Good job, you twat.  The slot machine. 
[00:15:00]  Jared from the...  You one-armed twat.  What?  Stop.  Hold.  Hold.  No, I think this will be a good thing for you guys, really.  No, it's going to be an innocent little piece.  We come in, we film you a little bit, and Bill, you know, Bill, we'll talk to you.  No, it's a real good thing.  You set us up, you twat.  I enjoyed it.  And I know we were being set up, but you weren't even honest about it.  Jared from Jersey.  Last night, my mom turned it on just quick to see Anthony screaming, take your bra off  and take it off now.  Followed by him talking about jacking. 
[00:15:30]  She's like, this is what you listen to?  Yeah, it made it sound like I was saying that.  It was about me talking about panties.  I know.  That was my Vince impression, though.  It's a bit that's about five years old.  Yeah.  Whatever.  But that was a Vince impression.  Take your bra off and take it off now.  And the way they show it, it's like I'm just yelling at some woman to take her bra off  and take it off now.  Let's go to the phones and talk to Jim. 
[00:16:00]  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hold on.  Something's amiss with the phones.  There you go, Jim.  What's up?  Yeah, am I talking to the artist formerly known as Opie and Anthony?  The artist.  Opie, do you have a symbol now instead of your name?  I'm working on one.  The artist.  Is it going to be Greg the artist Hughes?  Yeah, my symbol.  Like they do Greg Opie Hughes?  My symbol's going to be.  You can't say that.  God, Jim, thank God I was on the button.  What would Bill O'Reilly say? 
[00:16:30]  All right, Jim.  Bill O'Reilly.  All right, take care, guys.  Bye.  Let's go to John.  Hey, John, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, first of all, I want to say I had no idea the Olsen twins were that hot until I watched  the Bill O'Reilly show.  Yes.  The hottest.  They are hot.  I don't care how old they are.  Second of all, the editing in that was so bad.  I want to know, it was obvious that they cut Opie off when he said artist, but I want  Opie to finish his thought.  Well, you know, we did it so long ago, but yeah, I thank God, and we will play it because 
[00:17:00]  you know, I said we are artists, and it was like, we are artists.  Luscious, luscious boobs were the next line, I believe.  No, and I think we were going to explain, not, you know, not like other artists, but on  a daily basis, we come in here and we create, we create a show.  We did say that.  We said that.  Sometimes it's T&A, sometimes, you know, maybe it's some comedy, sometimes it's something  thought-provoking, but in a way, we're artists.  We create every day.  Not in a conventional sense, maybe, but when we come in here and we're just having fun 
[00:17:30]  even, there's a flow to it, and there's something that comes out of it that is an art.  By the end of the show, we're like, wow, look what we created.  Another show.  Whether it was good or bad.  Our canvas is just, what?  It's air.  Right.  Well, you guys followed the insane clown posse, so you did look like a couple of renaissance  men.  Those guys are too much. 
[00:18:00]  When they showed him at the signing at the record store, and they were telling the little  kid to smoke drugs, go home and do some kind of drugs.  Yeah, but can I tell you about that?  Oh, great.  Can I tell you about that?  Those guys are a bunch of phonies, because, I mean, whether you love or hate ICP, I'll tell  you exactly what was going on in their minds.  They knew the film crew was there, and they were going to try to get as outrageous as possible  on purpose.  That's all that was about.  So, all right, guys, you suck.  All right.  And who hasn't asked underage boys if they had pubes yet? 
[00:18:30]  Opie asks every time an underage boy calls, it seems.  Not every time.  Tom, what's going on?  Set them around the air, they're in a hockey game or something.  Hey, I learned a few things.  Yeah.  I know why Opie gets all the quotes.  They're the only ones printable without a kiddie porn investigation.  Anthony said yesterday he was going to try to steer the ship into a different direction.  He steers like the captain of the Titanic.  And Ann handles interviews like he handles his divorce.  Deny, deny, deny. 
[00:19:00]  Very good.  You know, Sam did a great job last night.  I wasn't going to just sit there and be bullied by him, first of all, because that's what he  does.  He tries to bully people into a defensive posture.  And once you're being defensive, you wind up coming off looking weak or stupid.  And I said it before, we have this show, we know what it is, and we're not going to sit  back and defend it to the likes of him.  So when he asked if we feel there's any responsibility to the youth of America, you know, you could 
[00:19:30]  sit there and say, is there somewhat?  Is there this?  How much of it?  What do we do?  Do we think about?  No.  I just thought it was best to say no.  None.  None responsibility.  That's it.  None of us.  There is nothing, nothing in my contract that says I have to come in here and make the  world a better place and help the children and guide people and be a role model and be 
[00:20:00]  like I was saying, a psychiatrist or psychologist, teacher, daycare or anything like that.  It is not in my deal.  We are paid to entertain people regardless of what kind of consequences people think there  are, which like Opie brought up, have never been proven.  It's just, that's how we feel.  And I think that's how we handled it.  And you mean I made a good point last night?  Absolutely.  Dean, what's up? 
[00:20:30]  I'll tell you the funniest thing.  The funniest thing is when Bill is talking about we all have to be responsible for these  kids and you have to take on some responsibility and Anthony just flatly says, none on us and  they cut the whole piece.  It was the best.  And then Bill goes, none on us.  Indeed.  He's disgusting.  None on us indeed.  Indeed.  I thought the Beavis and Butthead response was going to be the funniest, but we never  got that.  I know. 
[00:21:00]  Well, I guess they saved us that much because they did have some bad video of us.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  What about my stupid smirk?  Very nice.  And just keep in mind, this guy just signed a couple million dollars on his radio deal.  Right.  Of course.  You guys suck.  All right.  The smirk at the tail end of the piece when it's slow motion and End of the Innocence  is playing and Opie's smiling and holding up two pictures that had to be cued out because 
[00:21:30]  they're naked women.  Great.  Great boob shots.  From one of our signings.  They freeze it like on one of the monitors that the studio Bill O'Reilly's in and Bill  just looks at it and then turns toward the camera to start his talk and he's just disgusted.  He's got a disgusted face on.  Their parents must be proud.  I was laughing my ass off. 
[00:22:00]  It's like, oh no, here's Opie.  This is the end of the innocence.  You look like Satan himself.  Yeah.  You look like Satan holding up these naked pictures.  But Bill looks, looks at the camera, and he's just disgusted.  Beautiful.  All right.  You know what?  We have to take our first break.  When we get back, we're going to play the audio from the piece last night.  Yeah, let's play some of that.  And we'll take more of your phone calls.  We barely have gotten into the phone calls. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else in America that you're hearing us, 866-277-4WOW.  Here's a guy.  Dave?  Dave?  Yeah.  First time listener because of O'Reilly.  Am I entering a no spin zone?  The no spin zone.  See, this is what O'Reilly did for us.  He thinks he's going to shut us down.  He gave us, I don't know, probably a couple hundred thousand new listeners today.  Thank you, Bill O'Reilly.  Thank you, Bill.  He just bought himself a new listener. 
[00:23:00]  Thank you.  We'll send him some wine or something for this.  I was wondering if maybe I could get an Oz DVD.  Oz DVD.  We're going to play the Oz game in a little while.  I got a quiz for you if you'd like.  Thanks, Dave.  Not a first time listener.  He knows we've been playing the Oz game.  Right.  Liar, liar.  All right, so we'll play the audio when we get back, all right?  Let's rock. 
[00:23:30]  These guys are able.  You sound like a flutie stick in the mud.  I hate you.  Sew up that worthless slot.  Oh, my God.  The O'P and Anthony Show.  It's Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  And you're checking out the O'P and Anthony Show.  That's Andrew WK.  There's a buzz on this guy, man.  Party hard.  Party hard. 
[00:24:00]  Ying-yang party hard.  Sorry.  Digging the tune in.  Gary, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to mention about this maggot O'Reilly.  Before he got the gig on Fox News and became a legitimate newsman, he was hosting one of  those scummy, sleazy tabloid shows.  Was it Inside Edition or Hard Copy?  Yeah, one of them, I guess.  And they were covering Spring Break, taking pictures of chicks with thongs and sleazy scummy. 
[00:24:30]  And now he's the voice of morality in America.  He works for Fox News, which is evil.  The man is a phony.  He's a fraud.  He's nothing but a Morton Downey Jr. wannabe.  That's all he is.  Hey, I didn't think of it that way.  That's great.  That's all he is.  He has no credibility.  And if you're listening, Bill O'Reilly, you suck.  Thank you, guys.  You know something?  I got no problem with the guy.  You know why? 
[00:25:00]  Because I know what his deal is.  It's an act.  It's an act.  Why are you going to fault the guy for getting on TV and doing the act he's doing as this  upstanding, you know, he's trying to be a moral leader?  You know, it's an act.  It's not real.  He's on TV.  It's fake.  Don't worry about it.  Gary, what's going on?  How are you doing?  All right.  Gary?  Speak.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:25:30]  You are on the air.  Turn your radio down.  Hello, hello.  Gary, you're on the radio, man.  Yeah, no, I just think that it's kind of like the pot pulling the kettle black that they  even show that on Fox.  Fox, one of the networks that show...  What, did you see half the promos they were running in between the seconds?  I know.  That's great.  One of the shameless networks on the air, and they're going to talk about corrupting the  child.  Yeah.  I love Fox, too.  I watch that.  I watch it all the time.  Love the Fox, and I love the...  Plenty of great shows.  I love the special last night. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  There were titillating shows.  It was fantastic.  Yeah.  One of the most erotic hours of TV I've seen in, I don't know, how much some time.  How much internet porn did they show?  I swear they were not cubing out some of those nude women on the screen.  They would show a girl.  For some reason, you can't show her from the back or the front without cubing out at least  something.  But it seems from the side, you can show a completely naked woman.  There was a girl on all fours, stretched out like a cat, stretching. 
[00:26:30]  It wasn't cubed.  Look at going, now where are you going to get this?  On the O'Reilly factor.  Well, we've been there because...  All nudity.  ...know what they do in the editing room.  They have a sensor there going, well, how much of this can we get away with?  Duh.  That's why they were showing you those shots.  Could have cubed everything but the face.  If they wanted to.  To make their point, they didn't have to show the internet sites, but, you know.  Well, when...  It's titillating.  When titillating.  When Bill gets on, and right from the get-go, he's just talking about sending the children 
[00:27:00]  away, and don't let your pre-teens watch this.  Don't let them.  You know, it makes you think, hey, all right, I'm going to watch this show.  Well, he's a smart man.  He knows what that means.  That means any kid under 18 is making sure he's watching that special.  Right.  That's why those stupid stickers on CDs don't work.  What was the key?  Those are the CDs that the kids are gobbling up, the ones that, you know, had the parent  stickers on them.  It was pretty much an education on how to find some porno on the internet, too. 
[00:27:30]  So, and I would ask Bill O'Reilly how he feels that a child might be watching that show  last night, and now knows where to get pornography on the internet.  I didn't know...  Thanks to Bill O'Reilly.  I did not know about WhiteHouse.com.  Ah.  And I want to know more about the eight-year-old that's addicted to porn.  The eight-year-old porn addict.  I guarantee that's going to be a whole different special. 
[00:28:00]  Well, kids under 10 addicted to porn.  That was lost.  There it is.  WhiteHouse.com.  Yeah.  And look, Anthony, it's not TV, so it's not cubed out.  Hot nude chicks.  Know how many kids today saw WhiteHouse.com, but it was all cubed?  Yeah.  And they waited for their parents to leave the house, or maybe go to their pal's house,  and now they're like, hey, dude, we've got to check out WhiteHouse.com.  Is that Bill O'Reilly's fault?  And now they're checking it out without the cubing.  The computer's fault?  WhiteHouse.com's fault?  Whose fault is it? 
[00:28:30]  Boy, Bill wanted to put none of the blame on the parents, man.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Well, you know, last night could have been a lot worse.  When they played the beginning tape of all the ONA listeners mindlessly chanting ONA  like they were at a Nazi rally, I'm like, ooh, this is going to be ugly.  That was pretty funny.  But it wasn't like in St. Clown Posse, all our listeners were 20 and above.  Right, right.  Yeah, right.  Not to them, whatever, but hey, Frank, you know what the sickest part is? 
[00:29:00]  What's that?  The sickest part?  That gathering where everyone was chanting ONA, the most rowdy, out-of-control person  that was there was one of the goddamn producers to that friggin' program last night.  Stephanie.  Nice.  She was completely hammered.  She had magic marker writing on her thigh with arrows pointing up to her crotch a mere inches  away.  She got so hammered, she started throwing beer at people.  That was the Hooters, right?  Yeah.  I remember.  She was completely out of control. 
[00:29:30]  And then she took my camera, because somehow she made it up to our office after taping,  took my camera, I'm long gone, and she's taking pictures of her...  She's taking pictures of her crotch underneath the desk, because she was wearing a skirt,  and I swear to you, we laugh at the string that we see hanging out of this picture.  Remember?  The string.  Where's that picture?  It's somewhere.  Is it somewhere?  If someone can find it, I want to see that again.  I don't feel like getting sued, though.  That one's funny.  So use your imagination.  No, we won't put it up on a site, because we would get sued. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  One thing I kept thinking about, they said the same thing 20 years ago when we were listening  to Judas Priest and ACDC.  Well, this argument never goes away.  Right.  It's ridiculous.  They said the same thing about Elvis.  They said the same thing about the Beatles.  It's just, as people get older, it's a new generation of older people that are bashing what  younger people are doing.  Right.  You know, what they should and shouldn't be listening to.  And Bill O'Reilly, there was one thing, and I commented on this, but it was one that  they cut out.  He talked about how these days, now more than ever, children are more exposed to disturbing 
[00:30:30]  and sexual and images that can affect them.  And as far as Bill O'Reilly's concerned, it does affect them.  And I brought up the fact that, you know, back during Vietnam, there was some really nasty  death and destruction on TV.  Right.  You know, that was, and that's the stuff that sticks in my head growing up.  Not cartoon violence, not comedy shows, not sex that I've seen in movies or sexual innuendo 
[00:31:00]  on television or Ronan Martin's laughing in the old days was thought to as being like,  oh, horrid.  And I was a little kid and I'm standing there watching that.  It didn't affect me.  What affected me was seeing dead people in Vietnam.  The body bags coming back from Vietnam.  As a child, seeing that, like on the news, was like, oh my God, you know, that affected  me.  I remember seeing that when my dad was in Vietnam, so I think that affected me. 
[00:31:30]  And I'm sure these days it's affecting children to watch the World Trade Center explode, people  fall into the pavement, seeing dead bodies being brought out of the site.  More so than listening to this dopey show talking about luscious, luscious boobs, as Opie  so eloquently put it in his artistic manner.  Listen.  I'm going to get going, guys.  Listen, Mr. Lube.  Listen, Mr. Lube.  But that affects children more so. 
[00:32:00]  And I think that is a lot more concrete and has been proven more than a dopey comedy show  or a dopey band that's talking about sex and drugs or Marilyn Manson, wrestling or anyone  else they spoke to last night.  Marilyn Manson came across very intelligent last night, by the way.  He's a smart guy.  Duh.  And I think it shocked Bill O'Reilly.  Yeah.  He was expecting probably some guy to walk in and be all doofy.  Yeah, Satan rules. 
[00:32:30]  He's, you know, and the guy comes across as exactly what he is, a very smart businessman,  a very smart man as far as marketing himself.  Jeff.  And he kind of pissed the Riley off, I think.  Jeff, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I just want to know, am I going to have to wait until 520 to hear this audio?  No, no.  We're going to play real soon.  All right, man.  Thanks.  We're just trying to get to it, but there's so many phone calls and instant feedback coming  in.  It's ridiculous.  It seems like we have a huge audience today for some reason.  Fox News.  See you guys later.  Fox News, which Bill O'Reilly is part of, loves showing violence, a lot of violence. 
[00:33:00]  Nasty stuff.  They like sensationalizing whatever violence they do show.  And I think that affects children more than any comedy or sexual content does.  Stop, you know?  It's like if you're showing bodies being blown apart on the news and it's real people.  These are real people really dying.  It's not like a movie or radio show or TV where you're showing a little boobage, talking 
[00:33:30]  about a little smangy, smangy, little ice, lube, lube, jacking it, the Olsen Twins.  Olsen Twins, how's that going to negatively affect anybody?  Punch their most recent picture up.  They're hot.  I give up with you and the Olsen Twins.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What kills me is I remember listening to a show about a year ago when somebody from O'Reilly's  office was calling up to set this very date up. 
[00:34:00]  And you guys were like, no, we're never going to come off the right way on television.  He's going to blindside us.  You saw what he was going to do over a year ago.  And yet you still did it.  And you let this idiot get away with it.  Sean, can I answer you?  Go ahead.  Very simple.  We went on that show last night because we know it helps our radio show.  Right.  That's fair enough.  And we also knew that we could hold our own.  And you know what?  I think we held our own last night.  We did come across.  We were absolutely confident enough these days to walk into a studio, his own turf, whatever 
[00:34:30]  you want to call it, and let anybody ask us any questions about this radio show.  And we will come across honestly and let them know.  And when you're honest about what we do, and when we talk to these people and we're  honest about it, there's nothing they can do.  They can't spin it any way to make us look stupid.  We didn't go on there making excuses.  Well, the editing has a big effect.  You've got to admit that.  They can spin.  The guy in the middle of America who doesn't know the O&A show, a hardcore listener like 
[00:35:00]  myself, you know, they could turn around and say, boy, these guys are really evil.  You know, they could say we're evil.  Who cares?  But they're not going to be mistaken as to what they're going to get when they tune into this  show.  Well, that's true.  Yeah, he just advertised our show for many people that have never heard of us before.  Well, you still suck.  Thank you.  And a bunch of those people will become regular listeners of this program.  So thank you, Mr. O'Reilly.  Look, Tuttle points out, if you want proof of Fox-loving sensationalism, they hired Psycho  Mark, for God's sake.  He goes, they hired Psycho Mark, for God's sake.  Psycho Mark, he prints it, capital S. 
[00:35:30]  I work for Fox and Bill O'Reilly.  I'm going to be on his radio show.  Psycho Mark, go into the boss's office and have a couple duanal on the couch.  Uh-oh.  Bill O'Reilly fired for saying the mayor of Boston's dead.  This guy...  Screw that Abercrombie and Fitch midget.  I'm sure we pissed him off yesterday.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What's up, man?  I'm going to be attempting to climb Mount Everest in about two and a half weeks. 
[00:36:00]  Holy S.  Are you really?  I've been training for about a year and a half on it, yes.  And I want to be the first person in the world to put the well on top of the world.  Oh, my God.  And I want to do it as a favor to you guys because I love you so much.  Dude, let me tell you.  You get that to...  If you get that done, I don't know.  Get a picture.  I need somebody to make something for me that can withstand, like, the 150-mile-an-hour winds up there.  Because it has to be something that I can take and stake up there.  Because I can't stay up there too long because the auction is only one quarter of what it is on the ground. 
[00:36:30]  I read into thin air, man.  Yeah.  Now, aren't you freaked out?  A little bit, but I'm going to be the first asthmatic to climb.  What are you saying?  See, he's one of these gross guys.  That whole being first thing is cute and all, but come on.  Oh, you know.  Like I said, I've been training a very long time for this.  First woman, first black.  You know, then it had to be the first blind guy, the first paraplegic.  Yes.  Are you going to have to have a special inhaler so it doesn't explode up there?  I would think your pressurized inhaler might explode. 
[00:37:00]  Well, up there high, there's nothing that really lives to give you asthma besides the cold, so I have liquid oxygen.  That can take care of me, so I don't know.  Dave, you're insane.  Yeah, I am, you know.  I'm from Philadelphia, so whatever.  Who are you going with?  I have one friend of mine that's a doctor.  He's in training with me.  That way he can take care of me and whatnot and look out for my best interest.  And who else?  And my wife.  Are you going to have any Sherpas going up with you or anything?  Yeah, right.  No, I'm going to take my wife from me.  You don't just take your wife to the top of Mount Everest. 
[00:37:30]  You don't just take a doctor and your wife.  Don't you have guides and stuff?  You've got to find the Sherpas.  Well, there's also another team of guys that have been training.  They're actually making the climb about a week after us.  So we're going to meet them on the summit because we're going to be living up there for about three weeks at about 28,000 feet.  Because our bodies, you have to adjust.  I know the whole story.  I have a great book, Into Thin Air, man.  Yes.  And then you just don't go out up Mount Everest.  You have to live on different levels of the mountain for weeks at a time. 
[00:38:00]  It would take about two and a half months to do.  It's pretty much like walking out on the wing of an airliner.  Yes.  That's the altitude.  Yes.  Dave, when are you doing this?  I am leaving April 9th.  And when will you be back?  I'll be back sometime in early June.  Okay, here's the deal.  And our listeners will remember.  Okay.  If we do not get a call from you sometime around June 15th, I know you died.  Okay.  Well, it should be published all over the world. 
[00:38:30]  So you guys are going to have the biggest ratings ever.  Well, dude, is there any way you can keep in touch with us as long as possible when you get over there?  I can give Stinky my...  No, no.  My something like that.  It's not Stinky anymore.  It's Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett.  It's Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett, whoever.  Wait, hold on.  You mentioned his name.  Not whoever.  Hold on, hold on.  Our Garrett is an Awesome Garrett.  It's Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett.  Yes.  And I think Awesome Garrett is going to punch someone in the face soon. 
[00:39:00]  Awesome Garrett is very pathophist.  He's not happy about his new name.  He's awesome.  I was wondering if I could invite Jim Norton to come with me.  Yeah, he'll go.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm freezing.  This sucks.  Yeah, this sucks.  The mountain has more danger than the mountain does itself.  He's paranoid to leave his apartment, but he'll go climb Mount Everest.  Yeah, okay.  Hey, you should call us.  Okay.  Well, I can actually call you from the top of the world, though.  There's a special satellite phone.  Yeah, call us from, like, Base Camp or something.  Okay.  All right, hold on the line, all right?  All right, man. 
[00:39:30]  There goes Dave.  You got WOW stickers, right?  I got stickers.  I need somebody to make a sign.  Whatever.  Even if you just write WOW on something.  Oh, absolutely.  I want something that's going to stay there.  Yeah, and then we need a picture of you with the WOW on top of Everest.  It's not like you're going to have a bunch of Indians from India climbing the mountain  and just grabbing your stuff and stealing it, you know?  That could be the greatest display of WOW.  Now, ever.  Ever.  Oh, it's going to be.  The rarest.  Unless we're going to the moon again.  Well, that would be good.  Imagine an astronaut calls us up.  Dude, I'm going to the moon, and I want to WOW. 
[00:40:00]  You know, that brings up a good point.  What is the most awesome display of WOW so far?  Now, we got a few.  We had the girl that flashed on the Today Show live for us with the WOW sticker.  Yeah, that was pretty awesome.  As awesome as Garrett.  Hold on.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  Awesome.  But then we had the WOW stickers on the bombs that we dropped over Afghanistan.  Ah, you know something?  Great display of WOW.  And then the WOW on, what, the F-14s? 
[00:40:30]  Ah, the refuelers.  Oh, the refuelers over there, over Afghanistan.  Oh, my God.  Would that be great?  Everest.  Everest.  Hey, that would be actually a good flight for me to see from the top of the mountain.  If the United States would just do me a favor and kind of nuke Afghanistan?  While you're up there?  From the top of the mountain?  God, that would be an amazing sight.  Well, Dave, keep in touch.  I sure will, guys.  And let us know how it goes.  I'm definitely doing it.  Yeah, of course, before you leave, you know, we'll kind of...  Yeah, great. 
[00:41:00]  We'll follow your progress.  All right, yeah.  Like I said, I'm having a camera crew going up with me also, so...  Cool.  They're not my personal crew, but they want to go up with me and film the whole thing.  Cool.  Good luck to you, man.  Yes, man.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys rule.  Thanks, Dave.  Later.  Bye.  This is Dave going to scale Everest.  He wants to put a WOW sticker on the top of the mountain.  That would be the coolest thing.  And WOW on the job, of course.  I think, personally for me, the WOW sticker on a bomb that was dropped in Afghanistan is  probably my favorite display of a WOW.  So far? 
[00:41:30]  So far, yeah.  You got to think...  I mean, just picture the thing being released, falling, as it's just plummeting to a target.  There's that bright WOW right there.  I love it.  You know, me, being an artist, I like the WOW and the luscious boobs.  Do you?  Outside of today's show.  You being your artist, yourself that you are.  Yeah.  All right.  When we get...  No one believes me.  When we get back, we're going to play the audio from the Bill O'Reilly special. 
[00:42:00]  Just shut up, because no, you're not.  Yes, I am.  O.P.  Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Ponderous.  Effin' Ponderous.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show today?  Yes.  By the way, on the show today, we're going to play the third version of the Oz game.  Oz.  We have a box set of the whole first season.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Giving them away.  And we might have a surprise for Earl today.  Earl.  Earl's not going home early, is he?  Make sure he doesn't go home early.  I had to give Earl my credit card for Who tickets.  I hope he didn't write the number down.  He's going to buy himself a Popeye's fried chicken franchise or something, and I'll be out.  Why?  Oh, I don't have it.  Oh, there it is.  Jacqueline, what's up? 
[00:43:00]  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  What's it called?  You know, the way that thing was edited, remember the Simpsons episode when Homer was prosecuted for sexual harassment?  Yeah.  Remember the luscious, aww, Candy.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Edited all of his words.  The media does that all the time.  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  Cool.  What's it called?  Do you guys want to hear something funny?  My boyfriend makes me do it for all his friends.  Uh-oh.  Ready?  Yeah.  Wait a minute. 
[00:43:30]  Wait, wait.  You can't say that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, you can't say that.  That sounded pretty odd, though.  Wait, can I ask you that?  Because you do a little moaning thing and then say, put it in the balloon knot, but you say the other word for it.  Okay.  Let's just give it a that.  But you do that, your boyfriend makes you do it for his friends and everyone laughs?  Huh?  And everyone laughs?  Yeah, it's just like, it's just a funny thing that we do. 
[00:44:00]  Like, he'll call me and he'll put me on speakerphone at his job and make me do it for all his friends.  Wow, that seems a little odd.  He really respects you, huh?  That seems a little weird, doesn't it?  No, it's just jokes.  Just jokes.  Yeah.  Ah, it's a goof.  You should call back for the, you know, maybe the fake-o or something.  Okay.  And then you can do it for 18 cities today.  All right.  All right?  All right, bye, guys.  I can see the boyfriend.  I can see the boyfriend.  Hey, I got something funny to do.  F my friends. 
[00:44:30]  Why not?  It's just funny.  It's fun.  It's fun stuff.  No, you're right.  They'll enjoy.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, so we were on the special last night, and we got to play our segment, because  now it's time to have some fun.  Bill O'Reilly, the corruption of the American child when their parents aren't home and they're  working two jobs or something like that.  He didn't really describe the child as much in the show as he did when we were doing the  interview. 
[00:45:00]  Let's say there's a child.  His parents aren't home.  He's unsupervised.  He gets home, and he's turning on your show.  Don't you feel some responsibility to...  None on us, Bill.  None on us.  None on us.  None edge.  None edge on us.  They run around Greek and Roman wrestling.  None on us.  Pleasure to say none on us.  None on us.  None on us.  None on us. 
[00:45:30]  None on us.  None on us.  None.  None on us.  None on us.  All right.  Hold on, John.  I see you got an itchy finger over there.  You're trusting him?  Uh-oh.  Dude, this is...  He is so excited.  I predict this will end in catastrophe.  This will end with Opie throwing something at John's head.  John, you think you can handle this job?  I think so, yeah.  Why don't we describe what John's job is going to be during this segment so that if it screws 
[00:46:00]  up, everyone will know it was John.  All right.  Got it.  What is the job?  Well, the problem is...  I don't know.  That must be in the 30 million extra part that you have to know.  Well, no.  The machine that the Bill O'Reilly thing is on that we're about to play for everyone  and stop many times so we can goof on ourselves...  Right.  ...is not nearby.  It's way over there.  It's on the A and B machine.  So we need someone else to push play and then push pause when we want to comment and then  push play again and then when we want to comment, push pause. 
[00:46:30]  So now if you mistakenly...  So he's got to be quick on his feet.  And if you mistakenly hit stop instead of pause, it goes right to the beginning of the  bit again instead of taking up where we left off.  That's right.  So that's another little tricky little part of that, John.  Oh, boy.  Rick, what do we do to you today?  Wait.  What are you doing?  Nothing, man.  Let me just say Rick was drinking at noon today.  Rick was slamming beers down at noon today for some reason.  I said...  I saw him drinking a beer.  I'm like, what?  What are you doing?  He goes, stressed out.  Why are you stressed out?  Stressed out. 
[00:47:00]  There's a lot of stuff to do for the show, man.  We're a popular show now.  We finally figured out that we can't just call it in every day anymore.  Oh, we still try every so often.  People are starting to take notice.  We just can't call it in.  That worked when we were just in New York, man.  All right.  So, John, you ready?  Yes.  Oh, God.  All right.  Now, what kind of signals are we getting?  You know what?  Oh, boy.  So, John, if I go like this, that means you have to hit pause, okay? 
[00:47:30]  Pause.  And then when I go like this, that means start...  Oh, no.  No?  You don't like this?  Hands sick.  Too many?  Look at his face.  He's already freaking out.  You all right with that?  I'm cool.  And you got better signs?  No, I...  Because Ed's going to have his own signs.  No, no, no.  I'm done with this because I have no faith in him.  Oh.  So, I'm not even going to try.  All right.  We were on the Bill O'Reilly special last night.  Okay, this. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, my God.  And then I do this.  Why can't Ben do it?  Then I go...  Ben, why can't you do it?  I'll do it.  John's all dressed nice, man.  You know, dude, if he...  John's a tire.  If you don't let him do it, he's going to be really heartbroken.  Oh, my God.  He's going on a date tonight.  His mind is somewhere else.  Oh, he's getting pulled out like that dink on the Diamondbacks.  Before he screws up.  Oh, my God.  All right, Ben. 
[00:48:30]  Get out of my line of sight.  No, no.  Let John do it.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  You know why?  Because he's going to have...  This is...  You know, John has done some little screwy things in the past,  but we can all bring it right back to the Brady Bunch episode  with Greg working for his dad.  He lost the plans because he was hanging out at the magazine stand.  But then his dad gave him another chance, Opie.  And what did he do?  He screwed up again.  That's right.  It'll be back to coffee for you, John.  Oh, John, this is your big chance. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Don't blow this.  So here's our part of the special.  Oh, John's an incompetent, John.  All right, John, look.  Here I go with the place.  Yeah, there you go.  The average American child watches 25 hours of TV every week.  And what are they doing when the set is off?  Well, the radio could be on.  Oh, wow.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big.  Yes, it's Whip Them Out Wednesday. 
[00:49:30]  Broadcasting on stations in the late afternoon.  If there's a wow on your vehicle, they see the wow, pull up next to you,  and flash you their beautiful breasts.  John, I was itching my forehead.  You idiot.  No, no, no.  Leave it there, then.  He's in panic mode over there. 
[00:50:00]  He doesn't know when it hit pause now.  His face is all red.  You see the intense look in his face?  Stupid.  All right, well, I just want to thank Bill O'Reilly for promoting wow for us.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  There's a lot of people that didn't know what wow was, and now they do.  All right, go ahead, John.  They are heavily into one thing.  Hey, what color patties are you wearing?  Take your bra off and take it off now. 
[00:50:30]  Low in it!  Low in it!  Low in it!  Low in it!  In one of the articles I read, you had an interesting phrase, cringe radio.  Right.  What's cringe radio?  We like to make people cringe.  That's a good answer.  Good answer.  Good one.  And they didn't even let us elaborate on that, which we did.  Hold on.  We elaborated on everything.  That's what I mean.  And then they just used five or six seconds.  They edited it out.  Right.  We were saying, cringe radio is that moment where you're sitting in your vehicle, you're 
[00:51:00]  at home, you're at work, and we do something on this show that makes you want to turn  the goddamn radio off, but you can't.  It's that cringe, embarrassing, you don't want anyone else in the vehicle with you to  look at you.  It's a very embarrassing moment.  Much like I felt when the newspaper came out last week.  That sums it up.  That helps anybody out there.  Yeah.  It's kind of like when you're driving on the highway and you see that car accident on the 
[00:51:30]  side of the road.  You got to look, right?  We like pushing buttons.  We like getting reactions.  All right.  There you go.  Getting reactions.  That's what it's about.  It doesn't have to always be a huddler, huddler.  It's about getting reactions.  John, now you got to like rewind a little bit.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Because Bill was saying something when you stopped in the middle of that.  All right.  Can I go back?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go back just a little bit.  You know where you're going?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:52:00]  Go ahead.  A little bit.  He's queuing it up.  That's a good queue up.  All right.  We continue.  All right.  But if I remember correctly, one of you, I don't know which one said, then you can pull  out your business and while you were talking about the Olsen girls, pull your junk out right  now.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yeah.  All right.  Which one was that?  I'm not sure that was me.  Was it, Opie?  With my obsession, my sick obsession with the Olsen twins?  You are a kid, don't you? 
[00:52:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Look.  Look, it's not like I watched that old show when they were little children.  You punch up their latest picture and they are fine young women.  It's enough with the Olsen twins.  I know.  It got you in trouble with the Time article and now it's getting you in trouble on network  TV.  You know, I can, I am never again talking about them.  All right.  Can you back up to Bill O'Reilly's thing again? 
[00:53:00]  Do you remember where that was?  Yeah, I think so.  All right.  Go ahead.  Good.  I am not right.  No, it's your deal.  You got it?  Okay.  All right, Ann, here it is.  This is what Ann said to a national audience last night.  While you were talking about the Olsen girls.  Guys, pull your junk out right now before you picture this in your head.  Get some lube, whatever you want to use to crank out a batch.  I remember one day when Mary Kate was doing a real important scene when she's feeling really 
[00:53:30]  overwhelmed and she's crying and drinking a beer in the shower because she's so stressed  out.  I just wanted to get in the shower with her and hug her like we do at home sometimes.  Thank you.  Did you see what I'm saying?  Now, they were trying to make that sound like it was me with a fantasy.  That was something we were reading.  I believe it was from The Onion about how one of the girls were a little upset and how 
[00:54:00]  they would take showers together.  They comfort each other.  Right.  When they were upset, when they've had bad days.  When I was reading.  It was a fake news story.  And as I read it.  But Bill decided not to tell anyone that.  Right.  He made it sound like I was saying this is what I want to do.  Do you see what I'm talking about?  You presented it as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is.  To our listeners, it's definitely innocent.  Definitely.  To our faithful listeners, they know we're joking.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings? 
[00:54:30]  We were going to do Lesbian for a Day on Friday.  I think we're still doing it.  And you were going to join the fray.  And it was going to be like a threesome thing happening.  Ladies that have the fantasy but haven't done it yet.  Oh, right on.  We set them up with another lady and they go at it.  Wow.  On your show?  Yes.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  Because you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  Am I wrong?  No, we go out and we want to do a good show every day.  Yes.  For the reason of not money.  You know what?  We're artists, too.  You'll see Becky's luscious, luscious. 
[00:55:00]  Awesome.  There it is.  Listen to that jump edit.  There's a great edit right there.  We're artists.  We're artists.  We're artists in the sense that it's not all about the money.  Yeah, money's kind of cool.  That's a cool thing.  But that's not our first thought when we put the show together every day.  It certainly isn't when you're...  I walk down the hall and go, wow, we did a good show today.  Or, oh, that stunk.  And you get, you know, you're either real happy or you're real depressed, you know?  You get bummed out if the show didn't go well that day. 
[00:55:30]  I'm not sitting there going, oh, there's another, you know, few thousand for the bank account.  He didn't let us explain that.  Well, he's built it.  Did he go back there, John?  I think so.  Oh, no.  Not money.  You know, I'm on.  Whoa.  Yep.  Not money.  You know what?  We're artists, too.  You'll see Becky's luscious, luscious boobs.  You're artists.  I like what we do.  And when we come off of a great show that we feel we did a great show that day, we're  feeling good about it.  Right.  We're not checking our bank accounts.  But in general, corrupting society or doing something to a kid that might throw the kid 
[00:56:00]  into turmoil, we didn't come back.  Do you have any proof that we're corrupting society?  I have no proof.  And the proof that entertainment itself, certain types of entertainment, are troubling this  poor child you speak of, this child that isn't watched and isn't supervised.  Is that our problem?  Is that entertainment's problem?  Isn't it everybody's problem?  It turns out to be everyone's problem, but it's not our job to fix it. 
[00:56:30]  We're there entertaining people.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  Last question.  Do you ever feel that the younger part of your audience, again, 12, 14, may want to  imitate you, not really understanding that you're highly paid professional entertainers?  The parents should do their job, parent, let them know the rights and wrongs, let them  know what's appropriate, what's not, in what circumstance it is appropriate.  So it's all on the parents, none on you. 
[00:57:00]  It should be.  No.  You know something?  None on us.  Right.  None on us.  That seems to be the prevailing philosophy among artists pushing their wares on American  kids.  None on us.  None on us.  None on us.  What a battle cry.  None on us.  You too.  You too.  None on us.  Big Yellow wants none on us.  None on us. 
[00:57:30]  All right.  Cody and Bob checking in.  Hey, Bob.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Anthony.  Pleasure.  Opium.  Always a pleasure.  Listen, you know, no matter what O'Reilly said last night, no matter how he tried to box  you in corners, say things that you guys almost didn't say, you still came out to prove to  yourself to be the professional goofballs that you always were and always will be.  Well, thank you, sir.  No problem.  I'm a professional goofball.  That's a compliment.  Yeah.  Opi, listen, I saw you last night and Ron and Fez in the green room last night. 
[00:58:00]  You chatted with me.  You're a great guy.  I'm sorry I didn't see you, Anthony.  I guess you were out with the Olsen twins, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  Take care.  Bye.  Got to get the valuable ever question.  Yes.  Tom, what's going on?  What's happening?  How are you guys doing?  How are you guys doing?  What's going on, Tom?  Hey, Ed, thanks a lot for putting so much pressure on me, man.  You know, I'm a parent.  Well, do you goddamn job.  Boys and four and two, man.  I got more pressure than the guy running the tape right now.  Oh, poor, poor, poor child. 
[00:58:30]  You know what I mean?  But let me just say this.  And, I mean, I kind of really do take a stand on this deal.  Not with you guys at all.  When you can stand, Tom.  When I can stand, yeah.  You guys like to bust my child.  Who's Burrell?  Would I get along with that guy?  Who?  Scott Burrell?  Burrell?  Burrell?  He's hilarious.  Yeah.  I like him.  Me and him could go out and have a couple of cold ones.  Hey, dude, why is your website out of order?  You know why, you a-hole.  It's out of order.  They crashed it.  Is it really out of order completely?  I can't get on there to see your lovely wife. 
[00:59:00]  I'll get her on there.  But listen, people are such hypocrites.  A lot of times, you know what I mean?  That person that was with the American Family Association got indicted on molesting a 14-year-old girl and stuff.  I mean, I really don't think it's talk radio, TV, or whatever.  It's society.  That's just the way it is.  And I mean, unless you're going to put your kid in a bubble, you know, it's just...  That sounds like fun.  I mean, I'm trying to be serious, dude.  Can you take me serious for one second?  I tried that once. 
[00:59:30]  Everyone laughed.  All right.  But it really is.  And then, I mean, look, I got two boys, four and two.  And I'm going to try to be a good, good parent.  Not going to be an a-hole, shield them from everything.  Right.  I just, I'd like them to learn from my mistakes.  And Lord knows, I've made quite a few, huh?  Learning from your mistakes, they're going to be Einstein.  There you go, baby.  There you go.  You done, Rube?  And hey, one more thing.  Opie.  Do you drink it, Bitty?  Opie, one more thing.  What's up, redneck?  See, I knew he was going there.  Of course. 
[01:00:00]  Take it easy over there, all right?  You're on the phone, all right?  Yes.  Ah, Tony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Tony.  Everybody's trying to pull the Norton.  Now that's what that's known as.  The Norton.  Yeah.  Dude, it was in me.  It reminded me of frigging Rob Ryan interviewing Spinal Tap.  I was waiting for Opie to go, but these go to 11, Bill.  We did some of that stuff, but they decided not to.  Dude, that guy's a dick.  That guy's rule.  Isn't that funny?  It was like the Spinal Tap thing.  Hey, Carl.  It's sexy. 
[01:00:30]  What's up, Carl?  Yo, you guys don't see that Bill O'Reilly's on your side on this?  Oh, really?  I kind of said that in the back office.  I was thinking, you know, we didn't come across that bad.  I think some of the other people came across bad.  And I was thinking, you know, maybe O'Reilly kind of used us for some free publicity,  because here we are, you know, talking about his special for the last couple of days to 18 cities, you know?  Yeah.  Well, I think the point of the whole show, though, at the end, if you watch the last 10 minutes,  was that he basically said, you know, here are a bunch of entertainers.  They all say it's parents' fault. 
[01:01:00]  And then I think that, you know, the basic argument that he's trying to make is the government,  because of the taxes and everything else and blah, blah, blah, it's conservative philosophy,  makes parents have to work so much that they can't watch their kids.  And I think that he's trying to be subtle about it, but I think that's what he's trying to get across here.  Well, but he didn't have to show me smirking.  Well, he had some fun with you guys.  That was funny.  He had some fun with you guys, but you guys deserve it, because you're a couple of jerks.  Yeah, we know that.  All right, Carl.  All right.  Bye.  All right, enough on that, right? 
[01:01:30]  You can stop sending me Olsen twins' pictures.  You fools.  This was a question that Bill O'Reilly asked us, Ant.  That didn't make the special.  Oh, you like movies about gladiators.  I don't remember that one.  Really?  Oh, Frenchy.  Everyone's corrupted.  Frenchy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Tom left.  Yeah, I know.  I'm with Billy Mac right here.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, they're both drinking then, right?  Yeah.  Frenchy, what do you have to say about Bill O'Reilly?  He's a big fat jerk-off.  That's what he is.  A fatso bastard.  He deserves to die.  He's not fat, though, Frenchy.  He's not fat, bro.  Well, there's a whole bastard, right?  And I like the Olsen twins.  I'll do them both, those two little bitches.  Those are two little sea stockers.  That's what they are. 
[01:02:30]  Two little hoes.  All right.  All running around like a little bitch.  All right, Frenchy.  All right, take it easy.  All right, bye.  Frenchy's...  He's trashed.  Frenchy's pedaling down 3rd Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,  with his bicycle with a basket on the front with a red wine  and French bread sticking out of a bag  with his beret, smoking his stinky French cigarette.  Oh, screw you.  Hey, can we play that Seven Dust song as we go to break? 
[01:03:00]  Seven Dust was in yesterday.  Our pals from way back.  And they stopped by yesterday.  It was very late in the show.  Yeah, after taping Letterman.  Yeah.  And came by and they did a couple of acoustic songs for us, man.  The latest single.  Yeah, here's the latest single, Live Again,  off Animosity, their CD.  They did it acoustically for us, Ant.  When we get back, is Earl still around?  Yeah.  Tell Earl we have a big surprise for him next, okay?  Young Buck from Philly says, yeah, let's take Tom serious. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, I know.  Seven Dust, acoustically.  Yeah.  Live Again.  Philly's radio is edgy, there's psychotic,  and then there's O&M, the Opie and Anthony show.  You guys are an undisciplined child wielding ultimate power.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in New York, 877-692-1027. 
[01:04:00]  Anywhere else outside of New York, 866-277-4.  Wow.  We're trying to hunt down Earl.  Where did Earl go?  We have a little surprise for Earl today, Anthony.  It's nothing too bad.  No, no.  But he went into panic mode, and he might have left the building.  He tends to do that if he feels the Earl segment is coming up.  Isn't that strange?  The Opie and Anthony show, he hears that Earl might be a subject on the show, 
[01:04:30]  and he runs away.  Any of the other programs here at the station in New York,  he hears his name, and he runs into the studio to get airtime.  Yeah.  Whether it's Ron and Fez or Pharrell, he runs in to get airtime.  Our show runs away.  Do we know where Earl is?  No.  Stinky.  Earl, is he out corrupting the youth of America?  Maybe he's hiding behind the door in the stairwell. 
[01:05:00]  Ah.  Is that where he hides?  Remember that one time he did.  But the...  He is long gone.  You tease something.  He has an idea of what happened today.  He's already threatened to kill several people, and he's gone.  And he has an idea.  Whatever, he got held by, Rick held by his belt.  He went in, I saw him come into Steve's studio.  He went completely crazy.  He went to Matty down the hall and went nuts.  And he, you know, he goes, I smoke it, I smoke it.  And you guys can go all F yourself, and I've had it. 
[01:05:30]  Our Earl is a lazy Earl.  Not as catchy as the Garrett.  No, no, of course not.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  Our Steve is a thinner Steve.  We'll have one for everybody.  Yeah.  Our Earl's a lazy Earl.  That's good.  Oh, my God.  Go F yourself. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, F you.  We've got to find Earl.  Damn it.  There's no way to get in contact with him.  No way.  I knew he'd leave.  The other great thing about Earl is he has a cell phone, but he never has it on.  Are we at least searching for him?  Checking down the hall.  Everything on his desk is cleaned up.  He pushed his chair in, much like he does when he goes home.  John, he's gone?  I've been through every office, every cubicle in this place.  Nobody's seen him in at least three hours.  How is he allowed to just leave?  Does he have hours? 
[01:06:30]  Does Earl have working hours?  It requires him staying here until 2 o'clock in the morning tonight with Eddie Trunk playing heavy metal.  Yeah, well, he'll be back tonight for Trunk's show.  That's when he'll work.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  We still haven't quite figured out what he does, right?  Jeff, what's going on?  Oh, and A, what's up, man?  Hey.  Yo, man, nice shirt, Opie.  What do you mean?  Got to say, hey, I printed a shirt you wore last night on the program, a KXOA shirt.  Oh, I had the KXOA on last night.  I'm the squeegee man.  We love the shirts out there in Sacramento.  I heard you talk about them when you got them, and I was like, yeah, O and A, what's up? 
[01:07:00]  But, you know, hey.  You thought we were lying?  No, I believe you, man.  They're cool shirts, dude, right?  Right on.  Hey, that's all, man.  But you know what?  Huh?  You suck.  And one more thing.  You know what?  Huh?  I knew it was coming up.  Yeah, well.  Hey, uh, are we going to find...  We can't do the segment without Earl.  I know.  We might have to put it off.  He'll be back.  He'll be back.  He can't stay away.  Um, no, but apparently he's logged off his computer, so...  Well, he's gone.  He's got to be gone.  Where is Earl going to go?  He's got nothing else. 
[01:07:30]  You know where?  If anyone's in the area of the Virgin Megastore in Times Square, I guarantee that's one possibility  where he went, or he went back to his house in Queens.  I got nowhere else to go!  He doesn't.  He's Earl.  Well, what do we do?  Well, now we...  We got to wait.  It wasn't even that bad.  We got to hold off on it a little.  Oh, come on.  We can't hold off on it.  It's a nice surprise for Earl.  Got no choice.  He ruined it.  Did he try his cell phone?  Again.  Try his cell phone.  He always ruins our show. 
[01:08:00]  He thinks it's hilarious when we make fun of someone else.  He's outside the studio on his hands and knees laughing, waving the white flag like,  I can't take anymore.  You guys are so funny.  Then if it has anything to do with him, he's gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He can't take it.  Hey, Jim Bob.  Are we on the air?  We're on the air, Jim Bob.  I thought I was going to hear the banjo music, I thought. 
[01:08:30]  No, we don't play that.  You're talking to a full-eyed pork and bean eating the bad of the bone hillbilly now.  Well, no.  We don't play that.  That music's terrible.  Well, I come from Gators Creek.  That's all we hear.  You live down in Gators Creek, Jim Bob?  Yeah, that's right.  You're the big apple.  Where's our last caller?  Are you from Chicago?  Uh, Sacramento.  Oh, I thought it's Chicago.  We're on in Chicago. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, you are?  You like the big city?  That's where they got that fag, the man-cowyer.  Uh, yeah, man-cow's up there.  In my humble opinion, he's a flaming homo.  I take a rusty old cattle prod, I use it on his beehive.  I pinch a loaf off on his doorstep.  If I feel like it, I'd sumbitch.  I took a hole in his colostomy bag.  What did he do to you, Jim Bob? 
[01:09:30]  Uh-oh, he comes willing now.  Uh-oh.  Give me the phone.  We talking about the man-cowyer now?  He's my bitch.  He's my bitch, you know what I'm saying?  If he were myself in, I'd be making him get on his hands,  and he's threshing up my toilet clothes twice a day.  You have to use a toothbrush, you know what I'm saying?  He's my bitch, he's my bitch.  Yeah, you sound like an angry guy.  I'm a sexy man.  I'm a nice man, but now he can get on my bad side.  I pull out my underwear, wrap it around his head,  make his mama give him a spank, and that's what I do. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, Big Willie, can we get a good day's work from you?  I'm a hard-looking man.  I get hot and sweaty.  Because I think we're going to replace our black man soon.  I'm the man.  I'm big, I'm bad, I'm black, I'm fat, and I don't smoke crack.  You don't run away from confrontation, do you, Big Willie?  Put somebody on the phone.  Let me yell at them.  I'm ready to talk trash.  You know what?  Who I want to talk trash right now is Justin Timberlake.  How come these guys like Justin Timberlake get a piece of ass like Britney Spears? 
[01:10:30]  Well, because they're famous.  Yeah, they're famous and have some money.  He's a small, fly-looking, skinny-nut Nancy boy.  I hold him down with one thing and release some bad gas in his face.  Are you saying you think Britney would appreciate having you a little more than...  I'm saying that's a piece of ass.  And let me tell you, the best thing about Britney is that booty keep getting bigger and bigger every year.  The bigger the booty, the better the booty. 
[01:11:00]  The booty ain't a big booty.  The booty ain't no booty at all.  I want that booty.  So basically, if Britney got some big booty that keep getting bigger, then I want that booty.  Give me that booty.  Every year, yeah.  Could you throw Jim Bob back on for a second?  I've got to ask him something.  Hello.  Jim Bob, you talk about, you know, Chicago and New York.  You ever been to a big city?  I've been to Atlanta.  That's a big city?  Yes, of course.  What do you think of city folk? 
[01:11:30]  Well, I prefer the country.  I live in a trailer.  Live in a trailer, huh?  What do you think about people that wear shoes?  People that are concrete walking people, they probably fix up a batch of dingleberry stew.  There's something wrong with the water.  You don't like the city people.  There's ugly ass hog farming city slickers. 
[01:12:00]  Well, what do you do for fun in the country, man?  Well, when city people come around, we beat the crap out of them.  There you go.  I'm in a wheelchair.  I put a hurting on anybody.  Oh, you're in a wheelchair?  Yes.  What happened to you?  Well, I got kicked in the head by a mill when I was a little boy.  A mill.  Wow, that's a sad story.  My breath don't smell like no collapsed cesspool. 
[01:12:30]  I'll tell you that.  Well, whose breath smells like that?  Oh, people like George Clooney.  George Clooney?  Smells like a collapsed cesspool?  Cesspool, why?  Uh, he just, uh, I really probably hold him down and pop pimples off.  He probably make him pop pimples off Willie's old lady ass is what he do.  I think his mama probably wear a butt club. 
[01:13:00]  Do you have a wife or a girl or something?  Uh, my sister, she's down Tijuana right now.  And what's she doing down there?  She do, uh, she, uh, a dancer?  Ah.  Something with livestock, I don't know.  You like those dancers?  Of course.  Of course.  I wish she would come home.  She's getting hit in the face by mules, too, I bet.  Let her come back.  I'm her daddy.  Who's your daddy?  You guys on in Tijuana? 
[01:13:30]  No, not yet.  We're hoping to.  I get that lucrative Tijuana market.  You okay, Jim Bob?  I'm fine.  What the hell's that sound you made?  What do you talk about?  You're not whacking, are you?  I've been drinking some booze over here.  Yeah.  Well, what do you do for a living that you can drink booze at this time of the day?  Well, I work in customer service.  Yeah?  I work in customer service. 
[01:14:00]  Customer service.  Doesn't sound like you really have the mind for it.  Hey, hey, let me just give it a word here.  This is Blade.  What's up, dude?  Hey, man.  What's up?  Hey, um, another thing I want to say, if any of your listeners are, like, tuned in this  afternoon and want to buy some weed, just, like, email me.  Yeah, really?  Where can they email you?  Oh, junkyardwillie.com.  Yeah, of course.  But, hey, check it out.  And also, like, in another three or four weeks, I'm going to have my crystal meth lab up, 
[01:14:30]  you know?  Oh, really?  That's a moneymaker.  Hey, but, uh...  It pays the bills.  Hey, if anybody wants to get high on the guy.  Hey, is Big Willie there?  Someone wants to talk trash to him.  Yeah, hey, Willie, come here, dude.  All right.  Give me the phone.  Somebody want it.  Somebody been talking trash about my black ass.  Yeah.  Uh, Rich.  Rich.  Yes, it's Rich.  Hey, you're on.  What's your name, boy?  Rich, that's your name, boy?  Big Willie! 
[01:15:00]  What's the problem, boy?  You talk too much trash, Big Willie.  Hey, you want to talk to anybody who talks trash over the telephone, why don't you come  down to my junkyard, boy?  I will come down there.  You know what?  My junkyard 9525257.  Bring your lanky ass down.  Bring your white ass down, boy.  That's all you do.  Bring you and your mama down.  Bring your mama down.  I told you the other day, Big Willie.  Uh-huh.  You ain't that big.  You ain't that big.  I'll pick your mama faster than I can shine a hook cap.  Bring you and your mama down, boy.  Big Willie.  I'll make you eat mama pants. 
[01:15:30]  Big Willie, what do you think?  That's all you do is talk trash.  That's all you do.  It's all trash over the telephone.  You never say nothing to my face, boy.  Why don't you come down to Philly?  I'm on my way home from work now.  I'll get my pickup truck.  Come down there.  I used to be a drill sergeant.  I'll meet you at the first junior center, Big Willie.  I'll whip your ass.  I'll make you do it.  I'll make you drop it, dude.  500 push-ups if I feel like it.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  Thanks, Ross.  All right, bye.  Get off this telephone.  There goes Rich.  I got to listen to that job, Tigger. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  Hey, we want to...  You see, the guys, they get all jealous because I look so good.  I'm the sexiest man alive.  Sure.  I is.

Well, we want to thank you for calling the show, man.  I like talking to you.  You come out to Gator's Creek sometime.  Gator's Creek.  Can't wait.  Well, maybe I'll come out for the family picnic at Dan Quayle's place. 
[01:16:30]  He lives up in New York.  Oh, yeah?  He got a mansion there.  So I'll come out for the family reunion.  I'll see you.  All right there, Jim Bob.  Yes.  And where could they get a hold of you, Jim Bob?  I don't have a phone, but I'm over at my neighbor's house.  You mean, why don't you call on the Internet?  Yeah, on the Internet.  It's junkyardwillie.com.  Junkyardwillie.com. 
[01:17:00]  I don't spill my name with a Y.  Anybody spill my name with a Y, I'm going to flop their butt with a rusty hubcap.  Why, was that one taken?  Junkyard Willie.  All right.  Thank you, Jim Bob.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Give us a call sometime soon, all right?  Yes.  All right, there he goes, Jim Bob.  Jesus Christ.  It's the Junkyard Willie prank call tape guy. 
[01:17:30]  I guess that was them.  Them.  Maybe one guy, maybe two.  I don't know.  Want to hear another track from the latest CD?  Okay.  Anything to get him off the phone.  Jim Bob found out that we were playing some of his stuff on the show and decided to call us.  Call up.  So here's another track called Save the Drama.  Check this out.

[01:19:00]  Hey.  Customer service, can I help you?  Yeah, you turned me into a representative.  You transferred me just now?  Yes, did he?  Yes, and the guy was a very rude man.  Okay?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, uh-oh.  What kind of people are working for this company?  I want to know.  Well, what's your problem?  You want to talk to a representative?

[01:20:30]  What?  I, I, I, I, you call him making an awful lot of ruckus here.  You know, who the f*** are you?  You're not supposed to be working for a f***er,  and this is how you people talk?  You say you want to talk to a representative.  Yeah, and you keep giving me to the same f***ing guy  that I don't want to talk to.  Well, you got to tell me who the f***er you don't want to talk to.  No, you transfer me to that same f***ing guy,  and I don't want him.  I want somebody else. 
[01:21:00]  What kind of f*** is that?  You damn city slicker.  What are you doing, f***ing with my head pal?  I got you on tape.  I have you on tape.  Play it back.  Do I sound good?  F*** you, sucker.  You good d***.  Ow, you city slicker.  There will always be retarded idiots  to entertain us with this stupidity.  Mindless, filthy, crotch-grabbing, Anthony. 
[01:21:30]  Mindless, filthy, crotch-grabbing, Anthony.  People grabbing their crosses and saying,  suck it, filthy, Anthony show.  Suck it.  Love the show.  Mindless, mindless, mindless, mindless.

[01:23:00]  Real quiet around here.  The hallways are empty, including Earl.  Guys, you've got to believe us on this one.  This is no 520 set-up bid.  Earl really left the studio.  We don't know where he went.  Right.  We did have a surprise for him.  It's not part of a grand plan that he comes casually walking in at 520 and then we do the bid.  After all, it's a holiday weekend.  That means the 520 rule doesn't work today because everyone's already out on the highways.  Right.  Earl knew that we were going to do something to him and he ran out of here. 
[01:23:30]  That is a fact, faggy.  And we're bummed because we really needed to do this to Earl today.  I know.  So if he comes back, we'll give him his surprise.  If he doesn't, we'll wait for another day, I guess.  Yeah.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Sacramento, California, 866-277-4WOW.  Hey. 
[01:24:00]  Hey, Dave.  Hey, Dave's away.  Let's get the booze and start drinking.  What?  Oh.  I'm just, I hear some things.  I hear some things a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  You're hearing things.  Hearing things over there in Boston.  Hearing things.  Dave Dickless.  Da, da, Dave.  Dave.  Dave.  Kinkos.  Look into it. 
[01:24:30]  Get that resume all together.  Dave, we know people that know people.  Right.  They're starting to question your authority, Dave.  People in the business, Dave.  Dave, this is going to be the, this is going to be one of the greatest days in O&A show  history.  We will throw the hugest party when they, they, they ship your country ass out of Massachusetts.  How does it feel to wreck a really good radio station, Dave? 
[01:25:00]  Brick by brick.  That's what we said.  And now it's looking.  We're taking AF apart by brick by brick.  Now it's looking.  We hear things.  And we know, I think at this point you could, you could pretty much take our word for it  that, that we know some people in this business, Opie.  You know what I mean.  There's a couple of people.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  And the people we've spoken to, Dave, I hope you've been listening, Dave.  Um, your, your time there, uh, it doesn't look like it's going to be much longer. 
[01:25:30]  You've written it as long as you can, Dave.  First it was, uh, the Opie and Anthony show.  Kind of put the station on the map.  So you figured you'd put Rocco and insert second A-hole here.  And then, uh, then the Ozone left.  John Osterlin.  He was the guy that had the relationships with the bands.  All the cool.  Knew the new music.  All the cool people left the station.  Right.  All of them.  Gone.  They all.  All the people that made the place cool are now officially gone. 
[01:26:00]  A lot of them.  Now.  A lot of them, uh, got fired.  Got fired.  Yep.  Kicked out the door like you and I did.  So Dave ran.  And Dave sat behind his big desk and allowed it all to happen.  He ran with it.  How are the ratings, Dave?  How are the ratings, Dave?  Dave, how are the ratings?  Oh, boy.  We don't get the Arbitron, um, because there's a problem, you know, between the company.  They're sorting it out.  But, uh, again, we hit things a little bit.  We get a little bit of information.  Just enough. 
[01:26:30]  A little bit.  Hearing things.  Hearing things.  And, uh, Dave.  Dave.  They are so going to kick your ass out the door.  And we will laugh.  We will have a party.  Remember when we got fired, Dave?  Remember when Opie and Anthony got fired and you were like, whew, at least it wasn't me.  Brucie Mipman got his little suspension.  Boys.  B-b-b-boys.  And, uh, you were sitting there going, whew.  Good thing it wasn't me.  And then Brucie got fired who hired you, Dave. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  And what did you do?  You allowed that to happen, too.  Good thing it wasn't me.  That was Dave.  Well, now, Dave.  Dave.  It's going to be you, Dave.  It's inevitable.  And we're...  We're hearing things.  We're hearing some things.  And we're all just going to sit back and giggle.  And, uh, Rock Hall.  Rock Hall.  Don't worry.  I'm sure your job will be secure with those stellar ratings.  You're getting an afternoon drive now that we're back.  And you know how in radio when a new PD comes in, they just love holding on to the talent the old PD hired. 
[01:27:30]  That's another little insider thing in radio that I don't think most people realize.  No.  When a new boss comes in, man, out with the old, in with the new.  Unless you got, like, stellar friggin' numbers.  We'd have been gone when Ken and Jeremy came here.  Gone because we were hired by that abomination, Gary Wall.  But, uh, gone. 
[01:28:00]  Ken admitted to us that we weren't his first choice.  Of course not.  But we've proved how stupid Ken Stevens is.  Exactly.  By the way.  By the way.  But, Boston, you're doing a great job.  Keep it up.  It's just a matter of time now.  Dave, I hear you've got to play a lot of classic rock now.  Oh, Dave.  Oh, Dave.  That has to hurt, Dave.  Oh, Dave.  Dave.  What happened there?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Dave.  Why am I playing so much classic rock?  Oh, boy.  Shut up and play it, Rockle.  Okay, Dave.  Whatever you say.  Anyone else noticing all the classic rock? 
[01:28:30]  There's a reason for that.  That's called a quick fix in the radio business.  Ratings suck.  Play stuff that's familiar.  Play the stuff that's been played a million times.  Back to basics.  Dave, get this.  Here's what we're going to do.  This will set you up.  This will give you something to look forward to.  Dave.  Dave.  When you have to sell your house because you're leaving Massachusetts and you put it up with  a realtor, our listeners will be parading through your house looking at your house.  When your house is up for sale, Dave, you know that point before you take all the furniture 
[01:29:00]  out?  It's like that point where it's uncomfortable because it's your house.  You're still living there.  I think people should start.  And you got to take people through.  I think people should start driving by to see what might be.  Take a look at the house.  What's going to be up for sale in the very near future.  You know how real estate is in Massachusetts?  Right.  It goes like that.  It goes real quick.  Here's a tip for everybody.  There may be a house up for sale very soon.  But could you see our listeners wearing O&A WOW shirts just trudging through his house, walking  on his rug? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Keep mixing in all that classic rock because that'll help the ratings up there in Massachusetts.  You know what?  I'm kind of feeling bad.  I want to help Dave out.  Yeah.  Could our listeners just call up AAF's business office and make Dave an offer for his house?  Make him an offer.  That's a good idea.  Make him an early offer.  To help him out.  Give him a little something to look forward to when he's moving back to Nebraska.  One less thing he's going to have to worry about, right?  Right.  One less thing.  One less thing.  Keep playing the classic rock. 
[01:30:00]  Dave, it ain't going to pull you out of this hole.  Let me tell you.  See, Dave, the problem.  This is the problem.  You're going to help him a little?  It's too late.  But see, when Ant and I were really stupid four years ago this coming Monday, matter of  fact, Anthony, are we less stupid now?  No, we're still stupid.  A little bit.  But at least we have people that support us and they have our back, you see.  There's many times we should have been fired here in New York.  But we have some people around us that kind of understand what we're about and they have  our back.  Remember four years ago when we effed up really bad and said the mayor died in that fine car 
[01:30:30]  accident?  Fine car accident.  Four years ago.  Right.  And you chose to turn your back on us?  Yes.  This is called the payback.  It's slow Sicilian revenge.  The payback.  And we will laugh our balls off when you get thrown out of that city.  Dave, how many times have you talked to us since we got fired four years ago?  Even though we were the whole station back then. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, that's right.  None.  Not one phone call.  That's a good move.  You think the classic rock's going to do it, Dave?  You really think that's going to pull it out of the hole?  Don't you think, don't you think that this program coming back into town kind of took  away the thunder?  Whatever thunder that Rocco was making when he sat his fat ass in a chair, maybe.  But no.  Sorry.  That ain't going to happen. 
[01:31:30]  Ouch.  I hear the jocks, they're bartending on the side to make a little extra money.  How sad is that?  How sad is that?  The jocks have to friggin' go out and bartend.  The same jocks that we said, look, you know, this is what you're going to have to do.  You can't make believe we're not back in Boston.  You're going to have to fight us.  Go out fighting.  Yeah, do something.  Many people in the business will respect you that at least you lost your job, but you fought  the whole way out the door.  Battled it out. 
[01:32:00]  But Dave Dickless told you to keep your mouth shut because that's the right thing to do,  obviously.  Ignore them.  They'll go away.  Hey, Rocco, you idiot.  Dave, the guy that's telling you to shut up, he's gone.  He's gone.  We saw that trend.  Ouch.  You think when you start dipping into the ones, wait a minute, the ones, our old station,  they think they're so high and mighty.  This is the reality. 
[01:32:30]  Less than 2% of all the radios that are on right now in Massachusetts are listening  to our old station.  Right.  W-A-F.  Ouch.  Good job, Dave.  Keep spinning the classic rock.  Yeah.  That'll get you out of the hole.  Uh-huh.  God, I can't wait.  Hearing things.  Hello.  Hearing things.  I'm going into the unemployment zone.  I'm going into the unemployment zone.  Unemployment zone. 
[01:33:00]  Our Dave is a fire, Dave.  Da, da, unemployed.  How great is it going to be, O?  Come on.  You will relish in this with me.  Without a doubt.  Then our job is finally complete.  All the backstabbers are finally, will be dealt with.  They'll be dealt with.  All, all debts will be paid off.  You bastard. 
[01:33:30]  Dave, is that what, because I got, this just got me started because I got a instant feedback.  Somebody in Worcester saying that Rocco's saying, Dave's leaving early so he can bring  in the booze.  He'll never know.  Shut up with your fake radio.  Shut up with your fake.  We're going behind the boss's back radio.  It worked for a while.  I'll give you that.  It worked right up until we came back. 
[01:34:00]  Stop with the fake relationship problems.  The fake Maddie or the other guy is living at your house and you have an argument like  the odd couple.  The fake you're picking your sidekick.  Talk about real things like how you completely sold out your other partner.  How you completely sold out the guy that was your other partner because Dave told you  to just let it go.  Could you imagine if Jeremy came in to you, Opie, and said, look, we're not going to pick 
[01:34:30]  up Anthony's contract, but we'll just drop some other schmo in this seat.  I would say, how much more for me?  Right.  How many more millions would you have gotten?  Jeez.  Okay.  Bad example.  Could you picture?  No, no.  Because some of our listeners are pretty stupid.  I said some, so don't get insulted.  See, the ones that are really stupid, you know, they don't know that we're talking about  them.  So if you think we're talking about you, then you're not the stupid one. 
[01:35:00]  So don't be insulted.  Get it?  Okay.  I have to stay for the record.  No, of course.  But he just, but Rocco sat there and came up with that lame fake, we're going to fly  a banner over Fenway with a seat number in it.  And if your seat matches the one we fly over, you're going to be Rocco's new sidekick.  Yeah.  And what a coincidence, this is the guy that worked at the station across the hall.  What are the odds a radio guy is going to be in that seat? 
[01:35:30]  More fake radio.  But we're hearing things in Boston, so keep it up, guys.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Guys in Boston, just plead.  We, I swear, we will have a great big celebration up in Boston when Dave's ass gets thrown out  there, out of that station, and the station just crumbles to nothingness, which it's very  close to now.  We've really done a good job with the Army up there in Boston.  They're brutal, and we love it. 
[01:36:00]  Dave, call us up if you think we're lying when we say this, that they are questioning your  leadership there.  What's the company that owns that station?  A little company that tried to hire us, and we said we'd maybe go back there if they got  rid of Dave.  Right.  We actually said that.  Because it was kind of up in the air for a while, who we were going to broadcast with  up in Boston.  It was.  And our old stations, it came up in a lot of meetings, because it would have been a homecoming  to Massachusetts and the same station we were at. 
[01:36:30]  But people had to be gone from that station.  Right.  We said there's no way we would ever go back there with Dave Dickless running the show.  And Hillman, if you think we're lying, go ask Dave.  Yeah, this is a great one, too.  Who was going to do morning six months ago?  Yeah.  Go ahead, ask him.  See if he'll tell you the truth.  Yeah.  If we would have chosen morning radio in Boston, in Worcester, whatever they want to call it. 
[01:37:00]  It would have been during the Hillman show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he'd have been gone somewhere.  But Dave will lie to you.  But it won't matter much longer.  Hey, we're going to fly a banner.  Hey, I'm looking for a job.  So if there's, like, an employer sitting in a seat that we pick, he's got to hire me.  What, it won't work?  You won't?  Also, another announcement before we move on with the show.  Opie and Anthony will not be doing an April Fool's prank this year. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Don't look for one.  Don't wait for one.  No, because radio in general has made the whole April Fool's concept completely ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.  Monday, we're on in 18 cities.  A lot of those other stations are going to be doing some wacky, wacky, crazy things.  I hope people call us Monday and tell us what the local stations were doing for April Fool's.  Oh, we've got to do that. 
[01:38:00]  We don't want to be part of it anymore.  There was a time we loved doing April Fool's pranks.  Well, obviously, we did quite a big one.  And that's it.  I don't think we've done one since the mayor's prank.  No, because anything else would be ridiculous and weak.  Because that was written about so much that other people decided to, you know,  to try their hand at their cute little April Fool's pranks.  They're not going to go, hey, we're changed formats today.  We're just going to, we're the new Elvis station.  We're just going to play Elvis music.  And then they play like three Elvis songs.  And they go, ho, ho, April Fool's to ya. 
[01:38:30]  And then they take calls from people, morons.  I really thought, I really, I really thought you were, you were going to all Elvis.  So we fooled you, didn't we?  Yes, you fooled, we fooled, April Fool's to ya.  Look at your calendar, you stupid bitch.  Yeah, you, you really fooled me.  There's that one, there's ones that make you look out your window. 
[01:39:00]  Well, well, because there's a meteor coming in.  Ladies and gentlemen, a big, big meteor going to be entering the atmosphere around noon.  And I want everyone to get to their window and call me up and tell me what it looks like.  I have to, there's no meteor, it's April Fool's day.  You are too much.  I was standing by my window and saw nothing.  And I'm looking for this meteor.  You're looking for the meteor.  I was looking for the meteor. 
[01:39:30]  You are looking for the meteor.  Well, there is a one, April Fool's to you and yours.  Jack Tool.  We're going to have a volcanic eruption today.  Yeah.  You know that little known hill in town?  It's actually a volcano.  It's going to erupt today.  Hey, everybody.  You know, today a law was passed.  You know, rape is legal.  Wait, what?  I'm off the what?  And they did that one in Boston.  Yeah.  What the hell is that little hill called?  Blue Hill?  Blue Hill. 
[01:40:00]  Blue Hill.  April Fool's prank.  One of the stations pulled.  Volcanic eruption.  It erupted one year.  That's great.  And everyone was in a state of panic.  I was driving toward it.  And when I heard the report, I drove away.  Because I didn't want to be in a...  Don't want to be on a volcano!  No, I didn't want to be in a volcano.  What am I, stupid?  It's lava.  Lava!  And there will be a radio station out there on Monday. 
[01:40:30]  Maybe someone could report to us on Monday.  That will announce that an underground mall will be opening.  Oh, that's a good one.  And they've been building it.  And no one has known they've been building it for the last three years.  And it's going to open up on Monday of all days.  April Fool's to ya!  Waddle, doodle, April Fool's.  Now, it's legal to drag them behind trucks today.  No.  On the Grease Man Show.  Waddle, doodle, bone dry.  Snarlings.  What?  I'm off again?  Damn it.  I'll go out and sell more commercial time for chicken restaurants. 
[01:41:00]  Greco-Roman wrestling.  On the Grease Man Show.  From Terran, Iran.  The oldest nation.  I was a Champlain of WND.  Champlain.  WWF.  AAU.  Champion.  And it's my pliésiori.  To talk to you today here on the Grease Man Show.  With me, the Grease Man.  On the greatest city on earth. 
[01:41:30]  The Big Apple.  At Madison Square Garden.  Boundry Snarlings.  Hello, you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Let me tell you my friends, all my wrestling friends.  It's me, the Grease Man.  Number one World Wrestling Federation Champion.  On the Anthony and Opie and Opie and show.  Waddle, doodle, bone dry.  Now I gotta play the damn thing now.  This is Arun Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation Champion. 
[01:42:00]  Pleasure for me to the Anthony and Opie.  They bring me to the WNEW.  It's one of the number one station in the Manhattan and New York.  And pleasure to have come here.  I wanna say hello to all my wrestling friends.  And hello to all people to the wrestling.  To the WNEW station.  Number one radio station in New York.  And pleasure to have be here.  Pleasure to all be here. 
[01:42:30]  Pleasure for me.  USA number one.  I ran number one.  Whip two.  Bone dry.  You're listening to me.  We'll be back with more of the Grease Man Show.  Water doodle.  Water dee doodle dee.  No.  No way for a fool.  David.  Yo.  Hey.  Hello.  Listen.  One year, your fellas down there on Z100, they switched, what do you call it, disc jackets 
[01:43:00]  with light FM on the dial.  Yeah.  They had me going.  Yeah, a lot of cities will do that because now there's companies that own a lot of stations  in one town.  So they're gonna switch morning shows on you.  And you're gonna be all confused.  This isn't my station.  And you're gonna be looking at your dial wondering what the F is going on.  Well, I know why that one doesn't work because there's so many people going, hey, I like  this one so better than that piece of crap I had.  I'm gonna listen to the other station.  Yeah.  I didn't like that other guy. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  All right.  Bye.  I couldn't believe I'm listening and I had no clue that it was my station.  Yeah, no clue, right?  No.  But then I realized I enjoyed the other jock better.  And you won't be coming back to this station.  No, that's right.  I won't.  Hey, April.  Hey, that didn't work very well.  No.  Sucks to be me today.  That sucks.  What the F?  I got the job security of a Dave Douglas now.  None. 
[01:44:00]  I'm so pompous I thought this would work.  Dave.  Da, da, unemployed.  I love it.  Rocco's intern checking in.  Yes, Rocco's intern.  Hey, could you guys talk a little slower?  I'm trying to take notes for Rocco, man.  You guys are losing me.  Hey, when Dave gets back, since we're drinking in the studio, there's going to be a nice fake  four-day suspension.  Rocco. 
[01:44:30]  Time off.  Hey, Marriott.  Marriott Hotel.  It's Rocco.  What's going on?  Hey, could you bring over a few chafing trays of pasta?  Some steaks?  Potatoes?  Let me have a french fried ennast.  Bring over, I don't know, a bunch of soda.  No, I'm not having a party.  I'm alone.  What are you talking about?  Bring a bunch. 
[01:45:00]  Then I'm going to throw Anthony's TV in the bucket of ice.  Hey, what's his TV set?  I think he's a douche.  That bastard.  I had a little portable, was it a little six-inch, five-inch black and white?  Little television, because there was no TV in the studio.  Cheap, dickless.  Do you realize our career started on April 2nd, 1998?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He put it on a big pile of ice that some shrimp cocktail were in or something, and then the ice melts and becomes what? 
[01:45:30]  Water.  And my TV is then not on a pile of ice, but in a tray of water when I walk in.  Sorry, man.  I didn't realize the complicated physics involved in ice and liquid and temperature.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, ONA, big fan.  They are not pleased at all when you call AAF and make a little offer to buy Dave's house. 
[01:46:00]  I called them up, and I don't know if it was an intern who answered, but I offered the car that the mayor allegedly died in four years ago and some Greco-Roman lessons for them.  See, that's a fair offer.  They didn't like it, so I said, you know, I heard you with the little benero, so I slipped in.  I couldn't miss it.  That's classic.  Listen, you know, I'm from Boston.  A little peshy up here.  I got a nice house for you.  I'm over there plowing over Foxborough Stadium.  You know what I'm saying?  That's classic.  Brian, thank you.  Keep it up. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, you guys are the best.  We miss you here in Boston in person.  Well, we're going to be up there next Friday.  I'll be looking for you guys.  You're the best.  We're going up to the Norton show, so we'll be there broadcasting live from BCN Friday.  All right.  Keep it going, guys.  All right, man.  Classic.  So there you go.  Yeah, that's the fool's pranks.  No April Fool's pranks, and Dave Dickless is really, really on a limited time.  Come play in the classic rock.  What a party that'll be. 
[01:47:00]  Have fun.  Waddle-dee-doo.  Hey, Carl's Mencia was on hold.  Hey, where did he go?  Do you have a number to get him?  Obviously, we could use him, too.  What, his phone card run out?  Yeah, I saw him on, what, HBO or something?  It's pretty funny.  We love Carl's Mencia.  Yeah.  We'll get him on the radio, hopefully, in a couple minutes.  If not, we'll play the Oz game next, okay?  Yes.  Opie.  I love snatch.  X-Men.  Spring on the horse.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:47:30]  You filthy crazy.  Where's Ben Anthrax?  That's going to make a sweeper.  Where's the kaboom?  Oh, Sam Adams.  Yes, college basketball.  It's heated up, Opie, is it?  Heated up.  Indiana, go Hoosiers.  Right?  All right.  There you go.  As long as Tommy Coverdale isn't too injured to play, right?  What?  Who?  What?  Sam Adams, Opie. 
[01:48:00]  I love it.  Look at him.  Number one better beer.  Oh, my God.  What?  Nothing.  What's the matter?  I love Sam Adams.  You will, too.  You watching all the games, are you?  It's a great American pastime.  Great American beer.  I'm going to amaze you with some cartoon knowledge soon, my friend.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Go ahead.  Grab some Sam Adams for your big game party.  Get the party going.  Trade up.  It is a trade up.  It's a great tasting beer, and a lot of people are catching on to it. 
[01:48:30]  Whether it's at the bar, you're picking up some for the house, hanging out with some  friends, trade up.  Grab some Sam Adams.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday. 
[01:49:00]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Wild.  Wild.  No, now they do...  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  They're getting a report.  They now do...  Woo-hoo!  They play the water song and then have everyone call up on Friday and go...  Woo-hoo!  Interesting.  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  Hi, Dave.  Hello, poopsie.  How are you, snookums? 
[01:49:30]  Dave, you know, I don't like that Opie and Anthony.  They're on your station and I don't like them.  I know, snuggles.  But I'm kind of stuck with them for now, kind of saddled with them.  But hopefully they'll be gone soon and the station can be just as you have envisioned.  I... I disagree.  I don't like them.  I want them gone now, Dave.  Well, there's not much I can do about it, lovey-wovey-wovey-wumps.  And please, could you shave off your 70s porno mustache? 
[01:50:00]  It looks ridiculous.  And it shapes me.  Once every six months.  When you decide to do it.  All right, lovey-wovey, but I'm pretty busy here at the station.  But, um, I...  I... I... I really can't do much about Opie and Anthony right now.  I'm kind of busy.  Okay, Rocco, come on.  I reciprocate, Dave. 
[01:50:30]  Dave, what's going on there?  Just a little gay oral.  Nothing to worry about.  Anyone call about the house?  Everyone's calling, but I think it's a joke.  I'm a joke, honey.  And you married me.  Tool.  Why the hell are they in here?  We better do something to make sure he's not mad at you no more.  Because we came to visit, that's why.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  How you been?  My brother and Bill would be so proud that Lady Di is wearing a...  My brother Joe and Cowbell Bill shirt. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, I have plenty of these shirts at home, believe me.  Yeah, I bet.  Who invited you in?  That's Marion.  Say, Ben, you're standing there like this.  You're standing there like this.  No, I mean, who invited you even here today?  We figured we'd come up.  Monday is Diane's birthday, so she wanted to come by and visit you guys for her birthday.  Why do you guys have to visit us on every personal holiday?  Yeah.  It's great.  It's Groundhog Day.  I figured we'd come up.  It's Groundhog Day.  It's what?  We came up to visit.  We missed you guys.  It's Groundhog Day.  I figured we'd come up today. 
[01:51:30]  It's great.  It's the signing of the Magna Carta.  What are you all for?  What is that like?  Hey, you guys going to the Colorado Cafe tomorrow?  I'm going to put Diane on a mechanical bull.  Yeah, she's going to do that as my birthday treat.  I will.  I'll do it in the bikini.  I'm going to put her on a mechanical bull tomorrow night.  Wait, who's going to be on a mechanical bull?  She is the mechanical bull.  I know it's going to be there.  You're going to ride Lady Di?  I'm going to have her go on a mechanical bull.  Oh, oh, oh.  No, I'm going on the mechanical bull tomorrow.  Hey, or I'm going to tell her to go line dance.  I just picture the machine smoking and springs and gears flying out of it. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, guys, how are you?  How are you?  Well, hopefully she'll take line dancing lessons tomorrow night.  I'm going to do that, too.  Lady Di?  She's going to go do-si-do, and away she goes.  Yes, I am.  Lady Di?  I got her period, so we decided to stop by and say hi.  That's great.  So, you're going to a country bar.  Yes, we are.  I may go, may not.  It depends.  I've got to cook all day tomorrow.  You know, they're going to wear my big cowboy hat, too.  Yeah, you better wear a hat so they don't rope you, heal you, and then brand you.  Thanks, Anthony.  How are you? 
[01:52:30]  Ladies, I got scraped away, so we decided to stop by and say hi.  What?  You think we're losing weight?  At least me.  I lost a little weight.  Why?  You've been...  Now, I'll be honest.  Marion, step this way.  What do you think?  Because I can't see you.  You're behind the goddamn console.  Stand there.  Let me look.  Let me honestly look.  All right.  Turn around.  How much do you think you've lost?  About eight.  Nine pounds.  Eight pounds?  Eight or nine pounds.  Eight or nine pounds.  Start chopping off limbs.  See, it's...  Not really. 
[01:53:00]  Now, hold on.  Hold on.  You've been on a diet for two months.  Look at our own Steve.  But I go three nights a week.  Our Steve is a thinner Steve.  Look at him.  Yes, Steve.  Steve is a thinner Steve.  That is true.  That's losing weight.  We're talking to thinner Steve.  That is losing weight.  Thinner Steve.  Awesome, Gary.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Steve, how many pounds have you lost?  About 87.  Close to 90.  87.  That's wonderful.  Close to 90.  He went under the knife.  Yeah.  So...  And why don't you do that? 
[01:53:30]  What do you do?  So we're exercising.  We're dieting.  We're exercising.  Lady Di, you're not exercising.  Yes, I am.  You're as bloated as ever.  No.  Yes, I am.  Lady Di, you look exactly like you do every time you come in here.  You've lost nothing except a little more of your dignity, which I'm sure there is none  of that left.  No, no.  I still exercise in the next time.  Marion is looking a little thin up top.  Thank you.  A little thin.  Marion is...  I was noticing the top.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Marion, what kind of bra are you wearing?  That's a guy's shirt, though.  No, I'm not trying to.  What kind of bra are you wearing? 
[01:54:00]  Why?  I think you've got to take up some on the notches on the shoulder straps.  I've got to tighten this back here.  Marion, those are like some over-the-shoulder boulder holders you've got there.  Look at that.  You're a little saggy.  It's a brand new bra.  All I'm saying is you've got to adjust the strap and pull them up.  It's a brand new bra.  You want to come along?  We've got to pull that up a little.  Wow.  It's a brand new bra.  And Lady Di, thank God, you're what's called a flatso.  You don't have to worry about the...  No, she's got big...  No, I know.  They're just flattened out.  She's almost as big as I am.  All right, listen. 
[01:54:30]  I guess Carlos Mencia is not calling back because this is the gag, right?  So this is the consolation we get?  This is it, Rick?  Yeah.  He should call back.  This is the great week of radio we had.  Why weren't you girls working?  Today's a holiday.  Oh, right.  So they closed down the government golf course?  No, they closed down a government building that I work in.  The government building.  She's got a G job.  This is the best friggin' story she's got for a job.  No cleaning for me today.  What government building do you work in?  Who's doing the undercover work at the golf course again?  Her husband.  My husband.  He works at the golf course. 
[01:55:00]  He works at the undercover work.  He works at the government golf course.  He's not a undercover work.  He's not a undercover work.  He's the greenkeeper.  He's the assistant greenkeeper.  I'm hoping to be head greenkeeper in five years after my schedule.  Mary met my husband at Bettingen's.  And Mary, we have pictures.  We have pictures.  She's got pictures.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  My name's Carl.  Hold on.  Awesome Garrett has entered the studio.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  Yes, awesome Garrett. 
[01:55:30]  That's a good song for him.  I love that.  Did you guys notice how Marion's cans are looking nice today?  Yeah.  I was kind of looking.  I thought she was going without a bra.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Marion, could you whip those out a little?  No, I'm trying to lose up here.  Just pull them off.  Marion, could you whip those out for us?  No.  Come on, Marion.  Don't you love Marion's cans?  I'm trying to lose up here for somebody like me.  Our Marion is a dopey.  Marion is not true.  Let me tell you one thing.  If I could go have these reduced, I would. 
[01:56:00]  Really?  Reduced.  But I can't.  Reduced?  Hey, I'm losing a little up here.  I lost a lot in here, in here, in here.  She's pointing at her jawbone.  She did.  Really?  You lost it in your jawbone?  How do you know, man?  My face, my neck, well, I'm here, back here, back here.  Wait, wait, wait.  What found it?  Our Steve, our thinner Steve, what?  I said she lost it in her face and her ass found it.  I know, right?  You guys.  I do work out.  The exercise and diet thing is not...  I lost around five pounds.  It's not working. 
[01:56:30]  No, wait a minute.  You didn't lose five pounds.  Give it a little time.  No, wait.  If you cut that hair, you'll lose eight pounds.  Let me tell you one thing.  It's working for me.  If she plucks those eyebrows.  I don't do that.  Obviously.  I don't believe in that.  I don't believe in that.  You don't believe in plucking eyebrows?  I never did.  Why not?  I never did.  How about a shave?  I never did.  You're like unibrow.  No, we don't have to do that.  I don't have to do that.  You shave your legs and armpits?  That I do.  That I do.  That I do.  That I do.  That I do.  That I do.  That's what I do. 
[01:57:00]  I do that, too.  I do that, too.  I hit the gym.  I hit the gym.  How much attention does Lady Di need that she has a comment about everything Marion said?  Yeah?  Let me tell you.  How big of a dent do you put in it?  All right.  I'll keep quiet.  I pushed myself to go last night.  You're dead?  No.  That's good.  I'm coming home, cleaning, doing what I got to do at home, doing laundry.  I pushed myself to go.  Yeah.  I went Monday, Wednesday, and last night.  What do you do at the gym?  The treadmill and the bike.  Give me a little.  You do the treadmill and the bike, and then you do a little weight.  I do the weight.  So you do some cardio, and then you work out on the weights.  I don't do the aerobics, because I can't. 
[01:57:30]  Well, that's how you're going to lose the weight.  No, I can't.  I do the aerobics.  I don't do the aerobics.  I don't care about you, Lady Di.  She's got to chime in at everything.  I do the aerobics.  I don't do them because of personal aerobics.  Aerobics burns fat, Lady Di.  Watch out.  You'll burst into flames.  I'm happy with you.  Thank you, Anthony.  I'm doing a treadmill for 35.  What's the personal reasons?  I'd rather not say.  Heart?  No.  Yeah.  I'd rather not say.  No.  I'm fine.  Female things.  Female problems.  Let me tell you.  Right?  Female?  But let me tell you one thing.  No.  I'm on a treadmill.  Does the treadmill look like it's leaking tranny fluid when you're done with it? 
[01:58:00]  No.  I'm on a treadmill for 40 minutes.  No.  Is your uterus falling out?  No.  Be quiet, Anthony.  I'm on a treadmill for 40 minutes.  Does your uterus get caught in the treadmill as you're running?  No.  Does your colon?  It doesn't fall out.  Oh, she's hot.  Oh, hey.  A classic Mario comeback.  Do you work out?  Do you work out?  We work out.  Look at us.  Do you work out?  Can you see us on TV?  We're stealth.  Look at me.  Do you go to the chair?  I'm pumped.  All right.  Do you guys, how many times do you guys go?  Mario.  Oh, man.  Mario.  Mario can't come out. 
[01:58:30]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  can't come out.  It looks like it.  We were thinking Mario from the video game.  I saw the mustache.  No.  There's no mustache.  You said you do cardio, but you don't do aerobics.  I don't do aerobics.  I do the weights.  What's wrong?  I want to know why you don't do aerobics.  I don't want to.  Your boobs bounce up too wide?  No.  Ah, that's probably it.  I'm going to tell you why.  The aerobics class is too many people, and people are climbing all over everybody.  Well.  I'm happy on a treadmill.  That's what you don't want to worry about.  No.  No, really.  No, it's true.  Really?  It's true. 
[01:59:00]  They're climbing all over each other.  I know she does the aerobics.  What kind of aerobics do you do, Lady Di?  If I go to the same day she goes, she's like almost climbing on people.  That's what we do.  So, what is it?  We've got to do some stuff.  We've got to do some stuff.  So, what is it?  Do a little for us.  Do a little?  Do a little aerobics for us.  I'm getting myself back into jeans, honey.  What?  I'm getting myself back into jeans.  Well, let me say.  Those are jeans?  Yeah.  I thought those are the same stretch pants you wear. 
[01:59:30]  They're not stretch jeans.  Yeah, but so what?  At least they're jeans?  They're not black stretch pants.  You know what they are?  They're stretch denim material stretch pants.  So what?  They're jeans.  They're not jeans, though.  They're jeans for fat ladies so they can feel good about themselves.  That's okay.  Let me see the side.  Let me see the hip line on that.  No.  No, let me just see where the belt line is.  Those are spandex jeans.  So what?  So what?  They look nice.  They look good.  So what?  I look good in them.  I'm saying don't.  I look good in them.  But don't try to tell us you're back in jeans. 
[02:00:00]  But you know something?  I look good in them.  And you know what?  When I wear them, they make me look like I did lose weight because I did.  All right.  All right.  Wow.  There you go.  And God bless you.  I lost a lot back here.  I lost a lot back here.  In your ass?  My butt's getting smaller.  Ladies, go back into the green room.  We'll let you help us out with the Oz game in a few minutes.  Okay?  We'll have Marion.  What's that?  I don't watch Oz.  We'll have Marion read the choices in.  Okay?  Okay.  I'm more of a soprano.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Ladies, please go out that door.  Please don't eat all the food.  All right. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  Go right out.  Carlos Menci.  Hey, did you guys hurt him into some other room?  Look at Lady Ty's ass.  Look at him.  Dude, dude.  Hold on, Carlos.  Go ahead.  Bring her back in here for two seconds.  Does she have the mini ass because the panties are too tight?  I worked with a lot of guys in the trade, in the sheet metal industry.  Don't tell me.  This looks exactly like one of the workers.  No.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Bring Lady Di in.  You're trying to say she looks like one of those fat plumbers? 
[02:01:00]  Her ass in the jeans she's wearing.  She's wearing these loose-fitting jeans.  Get that.  Lady Di.  Stand by the door.  Shut the door.  Stand by it.  Right in front of it.  Now, turn around.  Turn around.  Let me see your ass.  Look at...  That is the ass of every sheet metal worker, steam fitter, plumber.  No, it's...  Don't shake it.  Don't shake it.  Well, look at it.  You're wearing these loose, saggy, bottom jeans. 
[02:01:30]  Well, they're comfortable.  They're all right.  No, they're stupid.  And what's up with the three-foot comb in the back pocket?  You got that big afro comb.  It's a nice comb.  It's a big goodie comb?  It's a goodie comb.  That's what it is.  You know something?  Have you found a guy yet or anything?  No.  Don't even try to say yes.  All right, thank you, Lady Di.  Dressed like that and looking like that.  You got to do something with yourself.  Slap yourself together, man.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, Lady Di.  Carlos.  Dude, does she really look that bad, bro? 
[02:02:00]  You've never seen the recorded Laverne Cheryl?  Her pants look like construction worker pants.  Like a guy who's humping shingles up to a roof.  She's got these loose-fitting, and her ass is like wide and flat.  It's ridiculous.  I'm sorry to hear that, bro.  Yeah, it's a shame.  Hey, listen, I just called you guys because I saw you on TV yesterday, man.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  You guys are awesome, man. 
[02:02:30]  I loved it.  It was beautiful, dude.  You guys are entertainers.  I loved it, man.  Yeah, that guy Bill O'Reilly was a little too self-important  and thinking we should all be helping these children.  Right.  I love it when they ask you guys, man.  And Anthony's like, yes, we're entertainers.  It's the parents' problem.  Right.  We entertain.  We don't weld.  We don't teach.  We entertain. 
[02:03:00]  Don't forget, Carlos, we're artists.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  And you said we're artists, and he looked at you and he said, so you're artists.  I don't know what you were going to say.  Like you were going to say, all right, you got us.  We're not.  Right when Opie said we're artists, he goes to a clip of us live in the studio  talking about some girl's luscious, luscious boobs.  Yeah, exactly.  Dude, it was great, man.  You guys came all great.  Dude, he's a jackass that way, man.  He was making you guys. 
[02:03:30]  You know what?  You guys are right.  Everybody who listens to your show knows, but there's a few people that listen  because they're pissed off.  I just want to defend you by saying, you know what?  If you've got a kid that's a moron or a jackass, it's completely your fault.  As a matter of fact, you can probably trace it to your parents who should have  swallowed you in the first place so that you couldn't have kids and screw up  the rest of the line of genetics that you screwed up.  That's right.  That's what I believe.  The law of the jungle.  That's what it is. 
[02:04:00]  It's weeding out the weak.  Carlos, my favorite part of the whole thing last night was Anthony talking about  the Olsen twins again and telling everyone at home before he discussed his latest fantasy  to get some good lube and jack out of batch.  That was, man, it was so good.  He got the worst that you guys had.  And it looked, I was like, man, how are these guys going to recover from those two shots?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah.  And then you come out, we're artists and entertainers. 
[02:04:30]  I was like, genius.  We held our own.  Until the end, he shows a picture of me smirking, looking at, you know, pictures of girls topless.  And then the end of The Innocence is playing in the background by Don Henley,  and he gives this look of disgust.  He looks at the closing shot of Opie holding up naked pictures and then looks at the camera  that's on him and just has a disgusted look on his face.  Like he doesn't appreciate the beauty of the female form. 
[02:05:00]  Get out of here.  Well, if he doesn't, then he's a homo and he's just like, what's her name?  Rosie O'Donnell, who all of a sudden now, who's not on TV, who has nothing whatsoever to lose.  Yeah, now she's being brave.  All of a sudden now it's like, oh, I love carpet.  Oh, it's great.  I've been in the carpets for years.  Oh, I got my box cutter and my glue.  I'm down with the carpet, you know.  Ain't that the truth, man.  She never went to Home Depot before that.  All of a sudden, she's not in there. 
[02:05:30]  Now she's Miss Carpeteria.  I know all about carpets.  You want the Oriental rug?  You want the Mexican carpet?  What kind of carpet do you want?  I'm in the blonde skinny carpet myself.  Yeah, she's really brave.  She came running out of the closet the second she closes the deal on a TV show.  Now she just goes, I'm just going to spend time with my family and hang out.  So I guess she could be a dyke now.  Yeah, no, it's cool.  But whatever, man.  He's probably going to get caught with a little boy. 
[02:06:00]  And I hope it doesn't happen, but I guarantee you that's what's going to happen.  That dude is going to get caught with a little boy, bro, and then you guys are going to have him on your show and you're just going to tear him the biggest ass.  I'm going to love it.  Hey, before he interviewed us, he goes, hey, maybe I'll come on your show and talk about my latest book.  Talk about the book.  We'll bring in naked girls and I can feel them up.  I am Rock Quarry.  Ah.  Ah. 
[02:06:30]  Hmm.  I'm the O'Reilly Factor.  I'm the O'Reilly Factor, but I'll tell everyone I'm Gus Schultz and try to be a regular guy.  I'll go bowling with Opie and Anthony.  He's too much.  Don't tell anybody.  I like little boys.  It's such an act.  You know, you've got to figure he's a guy, so he enjoys looking at nude women.  All of us guys enjoy looking at the nude female form. 
[02:07:00]  You say you don't, you're either lying or you're really gay.  That's all.  You're sitting next to your girlfriend right now and you can't acknowledge that.  And you can't say it, but you're thinking it.  Exactly.  It's kind of like when you do a joke about women on stage when I do.  Half the guys laugh and the other half give me that look like, dude, I want to laugh.  Right, right.  But I will not get any tonight.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like, she's right here, bro.  She's right here.  I've been at clubs where you see couples sitting there and the comic goes, ain't all women just bitches and C-words. 
[02:07:30]  And everyone starts laughing.  And you see the guys are like, well, I can't, if I laugh, then it's almost like me calling her that.  I can't say that.  Yeah, because, because I can't tell my wife.  Why can't, why can't any guy just say, oh, come on, sweetie, he's not talking about you.  How easy is that?  Just laugh.  How much of a puss are you?  Plus, plus the reality is, is that, like, think about this. 
[02:08:00]  When a woman doesn't reach orgasm, you know, when she doesn't get there.  Right.  It's never her fault.  You'll notice that women never say, I couldn't do it.  I, it's always, you didn't make me.  You couldn't make me.  But then when we can't get it up, we're sick.  He's a bitch.  Everything's our fault.  It's like, what's up?  What's wrong, sweetie?  Well, you didn't make me, you know, you know, you didn't make me.  Well, sweetie, I couldn't get it up.  Well, you need to go to the doctor. 
[02:08:30]  No, you need to go to the gym.  Oh.  That's the answer to that one.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah.  Hey, you notice this, back to the O'Reilly thing, that a lot of the people that are so hung up on pornography or kids or something,  are the ones that put themselves in all these situations where they're able to be around them a lot. 
[02:09:00]  Like, they showed the one guy that was busted and he turned out to have a job where he was around kids all the time.  They got the priests and things like that.  I think if you get people that are joking about it in a dark comedy fashion, it's just natural.  It's the way you do it.  It's goofing on stuff.  It's dark comedy.  It's the people that just hold it in and speak out so loudly against it that are always turning up the ones that are three knuckles deep in the neighbor's kid. 
[02:09:30]  Well, but see, that's exactly what it is because we don't like looking at profiles.  Like, everybody wants to, like, pick on gays when it comes to pedophilia, for example.  But the majority of guys who mess with, like, adolescents are white males between the ages of, like, 35 and 45.  You know, but nobody wants to, like, it's all racial profiling and it's wrong and you can't do it.  Yeah, profiling works.  It works. 
[02:10:00]  But it's like this.  It's like at the airports, for example.  Why are we checking white people, black people, and beaners at airports so that when, you know, Ahmed goes, hey, why are you only checking us?  We can say, hey, we're checking everybody out because it's not racial profiling.  But the reality is that's crap.  Let's say a Mexican theoretically hijacked the plane.  Yeah.  Where's he going?  We're already here, dumbass.  What's he going to say?  We're white, Dominica? 
[02:10:30]  Yes, stupid, sit down.  Put on your seatbelt.  That's what it says on the middle of the life.  Fasten the belt.  They even said it in Spanish, stupid.  Let's theoretically say a black guy hijacked the plane.  Oh, I'm in control of this plane now.  Where are we going?  Africa?  Hell no, we're going to the NBA finals.  We're going to Detroit for crisis?  Relax, man.  And why would white people hijack the planes? 
[02:11:00]  They own them, you dumbass.  They're already weird.  There's no point in it.  The only guy that might hijack is in Ahmed.  That's why.  Right.  That's their gig.  Well, yeah.  Get mad at the other Ahmed.  See, like, you know what I do?  I call Mexicans that fit a lot of people in one car and I tell them, hey, dumbass, you're  representing the rest of us.  Don't carpool too much.  You're taking advantage.  Get over yourself.  You're representing the rest of us. 
[02:11:30]  Stop dropping, you know, Mercedes-Benz when you make money.  That's why I'm stupid.  It's a perfect car already.  You know something?  When you hear that on a California highway, a van overturned and 23 people were killed,  what do you think?  You don't have to think, bro.  That's my people.  Goddamn Mexicans, 23 of them in a van and it'll flip over.  Well, let me tell you how it goes.  This is how it goes.  Accident on the 5 Freeway in Santa Ana this morning, a Nissan pickup truck with 24 people. 
[02:12:00]  Pickups.  Both 23 Mexicans and a white guy.  Somewhere near a Home Depot.  We don't have the rest of the story.  Freaking Carla.  But there are some things that you can just, you can profile or tell who it is.  Give me an example.  When it comes to stealing, white people are the best thieves. 
[02:12:30]  You think?  And here's how you know the difference.  If you wake up tomorrow and you read in the newspaper, all right, two people walked into  a liquor store that opens at 6 o'clock.  They broke, they went into the liquor store and they robbed it at $6.37 and got away with  $26.35.  That's got to be a black, Mexican, or Puerto Rican.  Right?  Because we don't plan.  We just go, hey, you got money?  No, you?  Ah, stupid.  Pull over.  And we do what we do. 
[02:13:00]  Now, if you wake up tomorrow and a billion dollars was missing from some bank, that's  a white guy.  That's the difference.  When white people steal, they know how to steal.  Because they figure, I'm going to do the same time for stealing, you know, $37.  Right.  And I am for $37 million.  So I'm actually going to take the time to steal the proper amount.  See, some of the profiling is pretty accurate.  Most of the profiling is pretty accurate, for Christ. 
[02:13:30]  And you know what's funny?  That when it comes to the right profile, oh, it's all good.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, you can say, hey, is it true black people love Kool-Aid?  No.  Fried chicken?  No.  Is it true that all black men have large penises?  Oh, you know that's true, dog.  You know that's true.  It's like, come on, dude.  If you got a big penis, here's some chicken and watermelon.  Don't go.  Come on.  You like them one, you like them all, baby.  Yeah, they appreciate the large mule stereotype, but they don't like the Kool-Aid one, for some reason. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, the Kool-Aid doesn't go with the penis, is what it is.  Because for some reason, the watermelon seeds get in the way of the growth of the giant penis of the black man, you see.  So you cannot like, you know what I'm saying?  I hear.  If you got a big penis, then you know what I'm saying?  Then you're just a watermelon.  Carlos, I think they just dumped out of everything.  But actually, we got to go, because we have to play the Oz game.  Beautiful. 
[02:14:30]  You hear about this one?  You watch Oz?  What is it?  You watch this show Oz?  Yeah.  Yeah, on HBO, the prison show?  Yeah.  We play a cool game with the Oz.  Well, I want to hear about it, but listen, you guys, seriously, man, that guy was trying to, like, really bury you guys and stuff.  And I was really proud of you guys, man.  You guys did a good job of defending the rest of us, who love smart and breasts and vagina.  Hey, Carlos, we're going to see you when you come to town, right? 
[02:15:00]  Of course, man.  Are you doing the Beacon Theater?  We're doing the Beacon Theater.  Nice.  We hooked it up because you told me to.  Well, good.  We're going to have fun with that, then.  Hey, by the way, are you guys syndicated in Dallas?  Yeah, late night.  I think we're on in the middle of the night or something.  Oh, okay.  Why?  No, because I'm performing there next week.  Well, plug it, bro.  Plug it.  You just gave us 20 minutes of good stuff.  All right.  Listen, I'm performing, but that's all I called.  I don't want to seem like that's all I called.  Don't you worry about that. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  We know that's the real reason you called, but it's okay.  You gave us something.  Let's go.  I'm going to be performing at the Improv in Addison, what is it, Thursday through Sunday.  Cool.  I don't even know the number.  Call everybody.  All right, bro.  But you guys, thanks, man.  You guys, much love.  All right.  Keep in touch, will you?  Always, man.  All right.  There he goes.  Carlos Mencia.  Quick break.  We'll play the Oz game next, okay?  Yes.  And we've got a girl that wants to do the 6 o'clock queef.  Hopefully she'll hold on. 
[02:16:00]  Get your balls out.  Clap your ass up.  Get your feet in.  It's today.  That could be the gayest thing I've ever heard.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're not homosexual, but we are willing to learn.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Getting ready to play the Oz game. 
[02:16:30]  Yes.  Janine wants in real fast, though.  Janine, what's going on today?  Nothing much.  I want to queef you guys.  I called Monday, too.  Janine.  And she sounds like a lady.  She's not my effing wife.  Well, wherever the F she is.  And where are you calling from?  Um, New York Park.  Long Island girl.  Nice.  New York Park.  And are you hot?  What? 
[02:17:00]  I don't know.  Opie, stop it.  Children may be listening to this broadcast.  And it gives them the idea that they have to ask girls that and base their impressions on people based on if she's hot or not.  That's awful, Opie.  How big are your boobies?  Oh, my God.  They're huge.  Is this you being an artist right now, Opie?  Because I've got to tell you, it's coming up a little short as far as art is concerned.  Hey, man, everything Pablo Picasso painted wasn't a piece of art. 
[02:17:30]  You think that there's some Picassos that are just left somewhere and it's like, eh, yeah, this one's far short of a masterpiece.  Of course.  Can I please now?  Kind of like some of our radio shows.  Right.  Some of you just don't want to remember.  You know, the ones where we go, Rick, take that dat and throw it in the garbage.  Yeah, don't even bother.  I'm sure Pablo Picasso did the same damn thing with some canvases.  Just painted over it and started again.  By the way, where's my Campbell's soup cans?  You're going to start painting those?  Opie Warhol. 
[02:18:00]  Janine.  Yeah, what's up?  Don't sit there and cough.  Don't worry.  We're getting to you.  Yes.  All right, hurry up.  I'm ready for you guys.  Janine, you're from New York, right?  Yeah.  New Hyde Park.  Have you looked at the cover of the New York Post today?  No, I didn't.  Not yet.  Why?  Anyone in New York, Yasa Arafat has an excuse for a mustache and a beard.  And then there's just straight hairs on the side of his face.  It looks like he was eating something sticky and it got around his face and then he pushed 
[02:18:30]  his face in a bunch of trimmed pubic hairs.  Okay.  That is not a mustache.  Look.  Mary, look at this.  As a girl.  Look.  I'll take it out later.  Isn't that sick?  It's pubes.  It looks like a nasty hair.  I just want to queef.  It looks like a grandma's veg.  Yeah, probably.  Wait.  Let me make sure.  Let me just turn the paper sideways.  Yeah, look at that.  And cover the eyes.  And cover the eyes.  Even with the teeth.  Cover the eyes.  Okay.  Let me cover it.  Hold on.  Tell me you're not going to be thinking that the next time you see Arafat on TV. 
[02:19:00]  I was going to say next time you see Grandma's veg.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, a little game you can play at home.  Oh, look.  It does, right?  Oh, that's sick.  That's like the Lavia Majora.  All right.  Are you ready, Janine?  Hell yeah.  I've been waiting.  I'm so excited.  I've been waiting.  You want me to go now?  No, we've got to play the song.  Okay.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet. 
[02:19:30]  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Chance up and let yourself roar.  Ah!  Poof!  All right.  Can I go?  Ah, yes, Janine.  We're all...  All right.  This is my friend Terry who's listening.  All right.  Ready?  Let's listen.  Let's listen.  How was that? 
[02:20:00]  Wow!  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Yeah.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish. 
[02:20:30]  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Yep.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Chance up and let yourself roar.  Queef!  My God.  You could hear it all, couldn't you?  Hey, kids, have your sister try that at home.  Yeah.  After school.  Get your sister to try that.  All right.  Good, clean fun.  I do believe that was the corrupted child that Bill O'Reilly was talking about last night.  The one that has absolutely no supervision. 
[02:21:00]  It's time once again to play the Oz game.  Yes.  Helping us out today with the Oz game will be Marion.  The one half of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Do you think a lot of the guys in Oz have been there for many, many years and would have sex with her?  You didn't acknowledge my announcer voice.  Oh, damn.  I've been working on it all week. 
[02:21:30]  Damn.  Sorry.  Marion, sit where the usually funny Jim Norton sits.  I think any prisoner would rather be thrown in the hole than that hole.  Right?  I have to agree with that.  Anthony, really fast.  If there's no one in this hole, it could be a lot of fun.  Shut up.  Because I've got to get...  I've got to get the slug line in.  Oh.  Well, winners receive a DVD copy of Oz, the complete first season, courtesy of HBO Home Video. 
[02:22:00]  Oz, the complete first season is now available on VHS or DVD at all video stores.  There you go.  All right.  Let's get right into it because we're running out of time.  Yes, we have our callers on the phone.  You want to explain the game real fast, Dan? 
[02:22:30]  Yes.  We have lines, fun lines from some of the episodes of the first season of Oz.  We'll play a line, and then we'll stop it.  And we'll give you a choice of what you believe the next line will be.  And you'll have to guess which one you think is indeed the next line in that little dialogue from Oz.  And if you guess right, you get the DVD copy of Oz.  Right.  Whole first season.  Whole first season.  Nate from Dallas. 
[02:23:00]  What's up?  How y'all doing?  What's up, Nate?  Goddamn, Nate.  What's going on, y'all?  Nate, you're from Dallas?  Yes, sir.  That's closer to New Orleans than New York.  You bet, New Orleans.  I know about anatomy.  That's why I know that.  How are we doing in Dallas?  It sucks.  I was wondering if there's any progress y'all getting on in a decent hour.  I was up to two last night to hear seven does.  I don't know.  They got their heads up there, Ace.  Oh, tell me about it.  I've applied to every med school that y'all are in. 
[02:23:30]  Boston.  I've even applied to Tulane in New Orleans just so I could hear y'all at a decent effing hour.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  We are corrupting the youth of America.  Yes, and I'm proud of it, Bill.  And I will be seeing Carlos Menci.  I saw Pablo Francisco like two weeks back.  How funny is he, huh?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  All right, Nate.  We've got to get rolling because we're running out of time.  Let's do it.  You're ready to play the Oz game.  Yeah, I'll try my best.  All right, here's your line from Oz.  I'm here because I love women. 
[02:24:00]  I love every woman I see.  Tall ones, thin ones, fatties.  It's true.  You know, I once worked a circus one summer.  And I f***ed the drawer for the fat lady.  Watch this.  Mm-hmm.  I f***ed trailer park trash in West Virginia.  I f***ed rich girls up the a** in Aspen.  I f***ed PhDs, retards. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  All right, Nate.  Yeah.  You've got to guess what the next line is.  And reading your choices will be married.  Now, Marion, you know the rules we must adhere to.  I don't speak cow.  No.  All right, Marion, read the choices for Nate.  Read the choices.  Wait, wait, wait.  Howling monkey.  You're cursed.  No. 
[02:25:00]  Nate, you heard that, right?  We've got to get Jim Brewer to do the howling monkey so we can just have him on court.  We've got to play it.  When someone curses.  I don't want to steal his howling monkey.  Howling monkey.  No.  Marion.  Marion.  You can't say the F word.  Oh.  You've got to say F.  You can say F.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  So give Nate his choices.  You know I think I F'd your mom once, too.  All right.  Now, wait, wait, wait.  You've got to say, you've got to go, choice A is.  Choice A, you know I think I F'd your mom once, too. 
[02:25:30]  Choice B, you know once I F'd an amputee with both legs missing.  Missing.  C, you know one time I had a threesome with the Olsen twins.  D, she was the greatest piece of butt I ever had.  I've had them all over the world.  That's it.  That's it.  All right.  Those are your choices.  Holy Jesus.  All right.  She says the F word, yet she won't say ass. 
[02:26:00]  She says butt, even though ass is written on the paper.  You're allowed to say ass.  She was the greatest piece of ass I ever had.  And I had them all.  Over the world.  All right, Nate.  What do you think is the next line?  I'll go with B.  B.  B.  Which is what, Marion?  You know once I F'd an amputee with both legs missing.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see what it is.  You know once I F'd an amputee with both legs missing.  Oh.  Weird.  Winner.  Winner.  Big fan of Oz there, Nate? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Love it.  There you go.  All right, Nate.  Yeah, you got a DVD copy of Oz, the complete first season.  Courtesy of HBO Home Video.  Thanks for playing the Oz game.  Hold on.  You guys rock.  All right, cool.  There goes Nate from Dallas.  Bravo.  Good job.  Hey, let's talk to Caroline, Brian.  Caroline.  Hey, how are you?  You want to play the Oz game?  Sure.  I'm not exactly self-confident because I only started watching season three, but I'm going  to give it a try.  All right.  Well, here's your line, and then you've got to decide what the next line is going to be,  but here we go.  What, that's it? 
[02:27:00]  No goodnight kiss?  I'm beginning to think you don't love me anymore.  I do.  Say it.  Say you love me.  I love you.  I see you said it, but you didn't mean it.  I do mean it, sir.  No, I'm telling you the romance has gone out of our relationship.  But I have the cure.  I was saving this for your birthday, but... 
[02:27:30]  Well, I think we need it now.  No, thanks.  Come on.  You're going to hurt my feelings.  You know what happens when you hurt my feelings.  Put some on.  No.  Oh.  What was he putting on?  Lipstick.  He had given them nice red lipstick.  Was that Schillinger and Beecher?  Yeah, the funniest couple ever on television.  Those two are the funniest.  Funnier than Ricky and Lucy.  I thought that sounded like a yellow M&M, 
[02:28:00]  but I wasn't sure.  It's the yellow M&M, by the way,  who's telling him he better put the lipstick on.  No kidding.  All right, Caroline,  you've got to figure out what the next line is.  Marion will give you your choices.  Okay, choice A.  Okay.  Hey, I understand you want to surprise me.  A. You're going to wait for a special occasion to get yourself all prettied up.  B. Okay, fine.  Don't wear it.  Now, getting naked.  We're talking.  Taking a shower.  Prague.  C. Okay.  Hey, what if I got you a set of matching pumps? 
[02:28:30]  D. Excuse me?  You say what to who?  Can I get some kind of hint because of that line reading?  I thought it was pretty obvious, Caroline.  Well, what do you think?  Sorry, no hints.  All right.  Yeah, what do you think?  Oh, God, I was just so distracted by the line reading that I wasn't paying attention. 
[02:29:00]  Did you understand it?  There's a couple of words that you sort of pumpered on there.  A couple of words you understood.  I'm going to go with D, total guess.  B?  Which one was that, Marion?  Okay, fine.  Don't wear it.  Now, getting naked, we're taking a shower.  Prague.  Here it is, the line.  Okay.  Hey, I understand.  You want to surprise me? 
[02:29:30]  I'm going to wait for a special occasion and get yourself all prettied up.  I'm so sorry.  Can we give her one anyway?  Yes.  Because it's the last day of Oz.  She's a big fan of the show.  Huge fan of the show.  She's been calling us for years.  She calls in even when we suck.  I know.  Yeah, you'll get a copy.  Major faithful listener of the show.  Caroline.  Yes.  Oh, Caroline.  I'm sorry.  Caroline.  And that's my mother's name.  That's a pretty name.  Jesus.  What happened?  You see what we're learning today? 
[02:30:00]  What?  Vern Schillinger?  I like that name.  That's my mom's name.  Vern Schillinger.  Caroline, stay on the line.  Thank you.  And happy Easter to your mom there.  You too.  Bye, Caroline.  You got a pretty name.  I like that.  Hold on, Caroline.  All right.  There she goes.  She wins a copy.  Yes.  I hear a lot of people.  From HBO Home Video.  All right.  Let's go down to Philly and see what's going on today.  Philly.  Hey, what's going on?  I thought you were going to be a chick.  You're Fran?  Fran.  What's your name?  Fran.  Fran.  F-R-A-N. 
[02:30:30]  How much does that suck, dude?  I'm sorry.  It's a chick's name.  You know what really sucks is when your first name's Francis and your last name's Hoogerwerf.  Oh, is that the problem?  I'd change my name.  That's the problem.  But Fran, we see it on the phone.  We're expecting, hi, I'm Fran from Philly.  And we go, hey.  Hey, Fran.  I'm Fran.  Unless your last name's Tarkington.  Sorry, guys.  I think it's kind of wussy.  All right.  You know how to play the Oz game?  Yeah.  As long as somebody that can read is reading the...  Well, I can read very good.  All right. 
[02:31:00]  Very clearly.  Marion, just read a little better, all right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Open the mouth.  I'll go a little slower.  Articulate.  All right, Fran, here's the line.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm here to give you a makeover.  Huh?  Your boyfriend told me to.  He said, don't take no for an answer.  All right, Fran, you got to figure out what the next line is, okay? 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Marion, read the choices for Fran.  Okay, your choice A is, now that looks beautiful.  Look at those lips.  Perfect for sucking my C.  B, my God, you're even prettier than I thought you'd be.  C, now all you need is a nice set of T, and I marry you.  D, ha, ha, ha, you're a girl. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  That seems simple enough, right?  Yeah.  Did you understand it?  I'm going to have to purely guess on this one, because I couldn't understand her reason.  I don't understand why.  All right.  What's your choice?  B?  B, which is what, Marion?  My God, you're even prettier than I thought you'd be.  All right, let's listen.  Oh, my God.  You're even prettier than I thought you'd be. 
[02:32:30]  That's a winner.  Yeah.  You hear the laughing?  I got to tell you, when Beecher walks in to Schillinger's cell there with the lipstick on,  and they're all just laughing, you're even prettier than I thought you'd be laughing.  Classic.  Friend, you're a winner as well.  Hold on the line, okay?  All right, fellas.  Take it easy.  Congrats.  Thanks for listening, too.  Bye.  Heather, who's been waiting two hours to play the Oz game from Long Island.  Heather.  Yeah, hi. 
[02:33:00]  Sorry to make you wait so long.  That's okay.  I'm still here.  All right, cool.  You know how to play, right?  Mm-hmm.  All right, here's your line.  So, I'm pissed off about that.  So?  So, I hear you're responsible.  Where'd you get that from?  Oh, I got ears everywhere, Kenny.  I know it's true.  You don't hate old men, Kenny.  You don't hate old men.  What do you want, McManus?  You see those guys out there?  If I tell them to, they will gladly kick your ass. 
[02:33:30]  So what?  I'm not afraid of them.  I'm not afraid of you either.  You're not?  No.  Well, what are you afraid of?  I ain't afraid of nothing.  Ooh.  Mm.  All right, Heather, you got to figure out what the next line is, okay?  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Here's Marion with your choices.  Twice A.  Nothing you'd afraid of this.  You afraid of dying, you little effing punk ass.  Oh, my God.  Holy S.  What the hell is it?  That was like nothing like I was following along with.  Nothing you afraid of this.  No, no, no.  It's not one sentence.  Nothing. 
[02:34:00]  Exclamation point.  You see the exclamation point?  Oh, you go nothing.  That's very light.  That's very light.  So I didn't see it.  Nothing you afraid of this.  No.  That's not how you say it.  What?  Oh, my God.  You go nothing.  You afraid of this?  You afraid of this?  You afraid of dying, you little effing punk ass?  All right.  Do it again.  You C-sucker.  That's C.  Okay.  That's C.  I read B.  That's A.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I read A, then I read A.  Yeah, but the context of the A word.  See, you got to say A when it's worded like that.  You said I could say A.  Yeah, but in certain contexts.  See, I'm a professional broadcaster.  Yeah, why don't we start over?  Go with A.  Yeah, one more time.  One more time.  Start with A.  Oh, God.  This is painful.  What you asked me to do is A, nothing you afraid of this?  You afraid of dying, you little effing punk ass? 
[02:35:00]  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  B?  B, nothing you afraid of this?  You afraid of getting effed in the C?  Sucker.  It's an A.  Is she getting effed in the A, you C sucker?  A, you C sucker.  All right.  Go to C.  Can I just win something?  Oh, yeah.  Go to C.  Go to C, Marion.  C.  Oh, yeah.  I know you are about what am I. 
[02:35:30]  About?  It's odd.  Oh, there's an A here.  It's like an A.  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Okay, I see.  It looks like an A here.  They see again.  Oh, yeah.  I know you are, but what am I?  Awesome Garrett is in the studio.  Awesome Garrett?  Oh, Garrett.  This game's awesome, guys.  Okay.  Thank you, Awesome Garrett.  You're awesome.  Thank you.  So, are those my choices?  Oh, no.  There's one more. 
[02:36:00]  There is one more.  D, nothing.  You afraid of this?  You afraid of listening to this rich voice CD?  All right.  Heather, we need an answer, yeah.  Oh, my God.  A.  A?  Which is what again, Marion?  Nothing.  Nothing.  You afraid of this?  You afraid of dying, you little effing punk ass?  Let's go to the line.  Nothing? 
[02:36:30]  Nothing.  Come on, you afraid of this?  Huh?  You're afraid of dying, you little effing punk ass?  Woo!  Wow.  Yay!  Woo!  You rose above adversity.  How the hell did I do that?  You actually picked the right one.  After two hours, you got Oz the first complete season there, right?  All right.  Or the complete first season.  Hey, guys.  I don't watch the show.  Well, Heather, hold on one, okay?  All right.  What show?  Hooked on Phonics?  I'm reading it, okay?  What show?  Sesame Street? 
[02:37:00]  No.  Rapper room.  All right.  Let's go to Cleveland and say hi to John.  Hey, Ben, how many more do we have to give away?  We've given away, I think, four already.  Two to go.  John.  What's up, man?  We've got to make this quick because we're running out of time here.  You know the Oz game, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Will you shut up, Marion?  No.  Go ahead.  No.  All right.  John, here is your line.  Kidnapped the president's wife without a plan.  Yeah, I got a plan.  It's etched with a knife in the center of my hand.  So I guess I'm going to have to keep my fist clenched. 
[02:37:30]  Walk around D.C. in the rain to my wig.  Oh, Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  Rick left a mother effer in the goddamn tape.  Come on, Rick.  How do you miss a mother effer?  I was stressed today, man.  Oh, my God.  How do you miss that? 
[02:38:00]  That's the biggest curse.  God.  Dan, it's not like it was hidden.  You want to go to the next question?  We can do the next one.  All right.  All right.  Let's do the next one.  Unless you screwed that one up, too.  No.  Thanks, sir.  All right.  We're going to go to the next one, John.  All right.  Which means you might be the last person playing today.  No, I'll throw an extra beat.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's your line, John.  Hey.  Hey. 
[02:38:30]  I'm out of the hospital.  I see.  You going to give me a hug or what?  Thanks for taking care of me, Tawani.  What's the matter?  You ain't glad to see me?  Things have changed, Billy.  I've changed.  And now you're going to have to change, too.  Change how?  You have to stop being a fag.  That's how?  Stop?  I can't stop. 
[02:39:00]  I don't want to.  Oh.  Okay.  John, what do you think the next line is, huh?  All right.  We'll give our choices.  Marion, if you would, please.  Okay.  Choice A.  Well, you better stop mother effer.  No brother of mine is going to be a sea-sucking faggot.  Choice B.  D.  I'll beat the black off you if you don't stop being a faggot.  See?  Fine, then be a faggot. 
[02:39:30]  Suck all the C you can get your homo hands on.  D.  Looks like we got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Classic.  John, you heard the choices.  It's time to make...  Did you understand it?  Yeah, a little bit. 
[02:40:00]  Okay.  All right.  Well, guess.  It doesn't matter what you guess because we gave it to you.  Go ahead.  All right.  I'm going to have to go with C.  C, which is what, Marion?  Fine, then be a faggot.  Suck all the C you can get your homo hands on.  All right.  Let's see what the line is.  I'll beat the black off you.  Don't stop being a faggot.  No.  Give me a faggot.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  But much like the Special Olympics, which you could draw a lot of similarities to in this 
[02:40:30]  segment, no one's a loser.  No.  John.  No.  We're all winners.  We're giving you a first season of Oz DVD.  All right.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Hold on the line, John.  Thanks for listening to us.  All right.  Bye, John.  You know, we better take a quick break and we'll figure out what we're doing next.  Fine.  I'll paint and be a faggot.  I was having a lot of fun.  Come on.  Sure you were.  Of course.  I was.  All right.  We'll play what do we learn next.  I do this stuff with fun.  Nothing you can imagine has prepared you for this. 
[02:41:00]  I don't want them enjoying it like exactly.  Sometimes you want to hear.  What?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Before we play, what did we learn on the O&A Show today?  We have a bonus round of Oz to play, but it's a little different.  And don't worry, it's a little different than the way we've been playing.  And I believe it's more gooder. 
[02:41:30]  It's the last one we're going to play.  This is it for our last DVD of the complete first season of Oz, courtesy of HBO Home Video.  The concept, very simple.  Well, you listen to a little piece of audio from the show Oz, and you tell us, we will  give you four choices after you listen to the audio.  Who is getting F'd in this clip? 
[02:42:00]  Yes.  Which member of Oz is getting F'd?  Who's getting F'd?  Let's go to New Jersey for this one, and say hi to Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, not too much, guys.  Was this show entertaining at all today?  No, not really.  Yeah, I didn't think so.  No, I'm just teasing.  You know what, though?  We do have another sweeper to play.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, Awesome Garrett is not alone anymore. 
[02:42:30]  Really?  Of course we've heard this.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  Yes, he's awesome.  Look at him, look at him awesomely putting away the cards right now.  You're awesome, Garrett.  Hey, Garrett, how was the show today?  It was awesome!  He hates us.  I love it.  Because the whole, everyone walking the halls is going, hey, there's Awesome Garrett.  There goes Awesome Garrett.  Well, now we have... 
[02:43:00]  Our Steve is a thinner Steve.  He is indeed thinner.  I feel like I'm watching Letterman or something.  This is such a Letterman thing.  All right, Tim from Jersey.  You want to play Who's Getting F?  Yeah, I want to play.  All right.  All right, here is the clip.  Listen to the clip.  Then we'll give you the choice of who this is.  Marion will give the choices.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:43:30]  Hi, Tim.  All right.  Yes.  That's it.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Yes.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  Hold on, Tim.  Uh, Marion will read the choices.  You have to figure out who's getting F.  Marion.  Okay.  If you will.  Choice A.  Arabisi.  B.  B.  B.  B.  McManus.  Yeah.  C.  Augustus.  Or Beecher.  Wait, wait.  Becker.  What?  I don't know.  What?  I don't know.  10 dancers.  Get a F.  What was that?  What was she?  Augustus. 
[02:44:30]  Augustus.  Augustus.  I don't know.  Try again.  Try again.  What's that name?  Augustus.  What?  I don't watch Oz.  I don't know.  Well, you don't have to watch Oz to know there's no name Augustus.  It's like the month.  It's like the month.  Pleasure for me to play with Augustus.  Augustus.  It's Augustus.  All right.  Well, it's Augustus then, Ann.  I got to help him out. 
[02:45:00]  No.  Yeah.  Come on.  All right.  It's Augustus.  I'm not.  Augustus.  Beecher.  Beecher.  Oh, Beecher.  Beecher.  Well, I don't watch the show, okay?  But that's not Beecher.  It looks like a K.  Beecher is with a K.  Well, that looks like a K to me.  Beecher is with a K.  All right.  It's Beecher.  All right.  Oh.  Jeez.  Summonists.  All right.  Tim from New Jersey.  Summonists.  Yeah.  I'm going to go with B.  McManus. 
[02:45:30]  You're going to go with McManus.  No.  You don't watch the show, do you?  No.  All right.  I'll go with Beecher then.  Beecher.  Beecher.  Well, how about you give it another try?  Marion, what's the answer?  I don't know.  It's not up here.  What's the answer?  C.  What's the name?  Augustus.  Augustus.  Augustus.  Yeah, but the dude's in a wheelchair.  He can't do that.  That's almost a trick question.  It is a trick question.  Yes.  Yes, that is a trick question. 
[02:46:00]  How many levels?  Because a lot of guys out there thought they just heard man-on-man sex on their radio.  It was a clip of Augustus.  Augustus.  Uh, before he got sent to Oz, before he was paralyzed, having sex with his girlfriend,  and then the cops were busting in the front door.  And threw him off the building.  And they throw him off the building.  Right.  And penalize him.  Good question.  It doesn't matter though.  We're giving you the DVD eyes, the complete first season.  Nice.  Thanks, Tim.  Have a great weekend.  Bye, Tim. 
[02:46:30]  Uh, everyone have a great weekend.  We're not going to be able to play What Did We Learn?  Yeah, we learned a lot too.  We really did.  It would have been a fun one today.  Uh, for everyone going to see Jim Norton in Philly tonight, we'll leave you guys with  this quick little thing that Steve from FoundryMusic.com put together this way.  Yes.  I try to be funny, guys.  All right.  Thinner Steve put this together.  Thank you, Marion.  Say goodbye to your evil twin there.  Lady Di.  All right, guys.  Peace.  Check this out before commercials.  Feeling low?  The best way to not feel like a worthless douchebag is to listen to an even bigger piece 
[02:47:00]  of crap.  I am awful.  With the Jim Norton motivational tapes, you'll feel better about yourself instantly.  I stink.  Hate your body?  Take it from Jim.  I'm a meaty-breasted little nothing.  It could be a lot worse.  This sucks.  Problems at work?  I effed up an ABC audition today.  Hey, at least you have a job.  Everything I do, I look like the Manchurian candidate.  You'll be amazed at how much confidence you have after you listen to a mushy little nothing  tool on himself for hours on end.  Shut up, Jim.  I'm nuts.  Almost 13 years I'm doing comedy.  God, there is no justice in this world. 
[02:47:30]  It sucks.  You have the warmth of a trout.  What a retard I am.  Does anybody not see the disgrace in this?  Everyone loves Jim's inspirational live appearances.  It's a night of pale, meaty-breasted dullness.  Coming to a town near you.  I'm Margaritaville.  I don't sing ever, you idiots.  Stay tuned for details.  Just listen to the station and get tickets, you douchebags.  Love yourself.  Hate him.  I suck.  With the Jim Norton motivational tapes.  That's me, Jim Norton, folks.  Ugh. </pre>
