<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a wild ride, opening with a "F.U. Friday" focused on Opie's alleged Valium use.  Sandy, his girlfriend, suspects he's becoming addicted, a fear fueled by his recent back injury and subsequent consumption of leftover prescription Valium, supplemented by a generous supply from a "faithful listener."  This sparked a discussion about Opie's paranoia and Sandy's concerns, interspersed with a running gag about a studio fart, with Ben, a studio employee, bearing the brunt of the suspicion.  Listener calls offered various opinions on Opie's drug use, alongside promotional spots for Stacker 2.  The segment also featured calls from Mike (discussing the O&A/Don and Mike show relationship) and Fudd (from Anthony's band).  Bridget, a listener, repeatedly called to claim there was hidden camera footage of her getting waxed at the station – a claim vehemently denied by the hosts.  Psycho Mark was also mentioned as a studio employee; the Filter band was discussed by callers, with differing opinions on their previous appearance on the show.

The show then shifted to a discussion about the futility of band promotion (Opie recounted anecdotes from his band Rotgut and his brother Joe’s approach), followed by listener calls regarding the band's upcoming gig at Sergeant Peppers.  Humorous discussions about planned song covers, including Christina Aguilera and boy bands, and, controversially, a Columbine High School shooting parody featuring Anthony's brother and sister, took center stage. The song's inclusion prompted a brief debate on its offensiveness, including a call from CNN's Bill, expressing interest in the parody.  This transitioned into a rant about the corporatization of radio, including mandatory sexual harassment training videos, prompting humorous discussions involving on-air and off-air staff, including Gabriel from HR.  A caller, Mark, expressed envy of their jobs, furthering the contrast between their work and "real jobs."  The sexual harassment video became a recurring source of on-air jokes.  The "Bit of the Week" featured Spaz (Kevin), a coworker who called Opie at home, wanting to connect more personally. This led to humorous speculation and a dinner date agreement after the show.  Musical interludes, including jingles and song parodies, punctuated these segments.

Further discussion of the hosts' relationships with coworkers, particularly Spaz, continued, with playful banter about a potential future show just the two of them. This was followed by a segment with Jill, a woman previously met at a bar appearance, who had hot wax dripped onto her body in the studio, generating laughter, pain, and suggestive comments, alongside audience participation via phone calls and website photo discussions. This part also involved handling issues with no-shows from previously scheduled guests.

Numerous commercial breaks significantly impacted the scheduled programming.  The "Bit of the Week" then focused on Spaz's extravagant birthday spending spree, detailing his $625-a-night St. Regis stay, $700 mini-bar bill, and overall $2000 spending in five days on his $5500 credit limit.  The hosts and callers mocked his irresponsible spending, with Anthony sharing his own past credit card debt struggles. The segment also included giving away boxing match tickets, listener feedback on the "hot wax" segment, and commercials for Car Cash and Fidelity Diamonds. Foot, a musician/comedian, was a guest, promoting his performances.  The show ended noting their high ratings, particularly those contributed by their Detroit affiliates.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony. Brilliant radio, I'd expect.  Oh, God! Help us!  We are here, we are live. It's F.U. Friday.  Yeah, it is.  Everyone else and their mothers have off today, but we are here to entertain you.  Yeah.  Adjusting my electronics here.  There we go. 
[00:00:30]  Ah, and it's F.U. Friday.  Phone line, 212-757-1027.  I like this. This is what? Push Monkey, I think?  Fax line, 212-957-9639.  I'm all popped up on coffee, man.  So am I.  Wow.  So am I.  Well, the coffee's just to take the edge off. 
[00:01:00]  Is it, Opie?  Is it maybe to perk you up to the normal level before you start doing your narcotics?  Now that you're the new Elvis Presley?  How many pills was Elvis up to before he dropped dead?  Do you want me to get into this? I'll get it.  How many drugs is Opie doing before the show or after the show?  All right, I'll get into this.  Oh, my God.  Sandy, my girlfriend, is convinced I'm like the new Elvis Presley.  I'm a pill popper.  A pill popper. 
[00:01:30]  It could be Elvis, Jerry Lewis, same thing, Chevy Chase.  Right.  Same thing.  And it all starts, what's the pat excuse for when these people end up at the Betty Ford Clinic  because they're doing all kinds of drugs?  It all started with a little back pain.  A little back pain.  Absolutely.  Remember Chevy?  He was like, oh, from all those pratfalls I did on SNL, my back was effed up.  Right.  So I had to do like 20 Percodans a day and followed up with some Valium and 2-in-all,  2-in-all, Thorazine, or whatever the hell else you want to pump in you. 
[00:02:00]  I got a slight problem at home.  Sandy is convinced I'm Elvis Presley at this point.  Yeah.  Now, I mean, I got to stress to everyone how ridiculous that statement is.  I think I could do a better job stressing to people how ridiculous that is.  Okay.  We go out.  Opie barely tips a full beer.  Well, that's because I'm too busy popping pills.  Popping pills.  Well, maybe that's fine.  It doesn't go good with alcohol.  It takes the edge off the smack. 
[00:02:30]  Now, when I'm talking with Opie and he's coherent, you could tell.  I came over his house just the other day in time to pull the needle out of his arm  and we had a nice conversation.  There you go.  No, I mean, you're probably more paranoid than I am when it comes to taking pills or drugs or anything.  Taking anything?  I don't even take, like, Benadryl because it Fs me up, okay?  Benadryl's like mess going for me.  If I take it, even the stuff that says non-drowsy, go and fly a commercial jetliner. 
[00:03:00]  Who the hell farted?  Jesus Christ.  No, stop it.  Ben, was that you?  Be honest.  I didn't know it.  Oh, my God.  I don't smell anything.  I don't smell anything.  I swear to God.  I don't smell anything.  Ben, you're the only person in the studio.  What do you mean, maybe you're dead?  You're dead.  I know you did.  Maybe you did.  Dude.  You're not with your butt.  Dude, you're two feet to the right of me and something just crawled out of your butt, man. 
[00:03:30]  Maybe I did.  Oh, dude, you got cranky ass, man.  Oh, what, are you guys getting me back for being a bastard before the show?  Oh, my God.  Ben, what do you mean, maybe I did?  If you get caught, you've got to be honest on this show.  You know, I've heard some drugs.  What, did it just leak out?  I was fixing the spots while I screwed up, so I was fixing the spots, and then I, I don't know, and then you said it.  I'm not even sure.  Opie, some drugs affect the olfactory in the brain, the portion of the brain that, uh, is for your sense of smell. 
[00:04:00]  Maybe that's it.  I honestly don't smell it.  Ben reached up, and next thing you know, he let out a little poof.  I didn't smell that.  I don't smell it.  I swear.  I'm not trying to.  I didn't smell anything either.  Because, look, you're over there.  I went into the protective.  Look how close he was.  I went into the protective duck and cover, put the shirt over my nose thing, but I didn't smell anything.  I don't smell it.  I don't smell it.  Because it's your own fart.  Of course you're not going to smell it.  Hmm.  Oh. 
[00:04:30]  I'm just saying.  Yeah, the valet is getting to it.  That's what it is.  See, he's on the drugs.  Now he's freaking.  Oh, Ben.  Jesus.  It's all right.  We all fart, but damn, not, like, right in my face.  Anyway, where were we at?  We were talking about your drug addiction.  Oh, yeah.  Well, all right, we got to take a break.  Already?  Yeah, we really do.  I'm like, don't fart.  Oh, no.  Opie's freaking out. 
[00:05:00]  Psycho Mark came running in and pointed his ass at Opie.  You one-hit wonder.  Get the hell out of here.  One-hit wonder.  One-hit wonder.  One-hit wonder.  Come on.  Come on.  We are going to have fun tonight.  All right, listen.  No way.  All right, listen, listen, listen, listen.  Yeah.  We have some great phone calls.  I'll get into the Elvis Presley thing next, without a doubt.  We just got to take a really quick break, Anthony.  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.  Okay.  We're supposed to get all our commercials in before three. 
[00:05:30]  That's the only reason, okay?  Yeah.  We'll pick up the Elvis Presley story right after this.  Stay there.  This is your announcer, Hugh Munguspecker, saying,  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  We're obnoxious little assholes.  1027-W-NEW.  Hey, I think you said Anthony one more time than Opie in that sweeper there.  Oh, my God.  All right, it's the O&A Show.  212-757-1027. 
[00:06:00]  And where were we before we were interrupted by a farce?  Well, I think we were doing your intervention.  Oh, that's right.  Your brand-new problem.  Narcotics.  That's right.  Sandy thinks I'm the new Elvis Presley.  Opie's on the drugs.  It starts out this way all the time.  You hear the celebrities.  It starts out with Jerry Lewis.  Back pain.  Oh.  Hiya, back pain.  Oh.  And before you know it, they're hooked.  So now you've had a little back pain, Opie. 
[00:06:30]  Well, yeah, Anthony, I have.  It hasn't been a little back pain.  I threw out my whole damn back on Monday to the point where it's really hard to walk.  Today, it feels much, much better.  I see you're walking very well today.  Much, much better.  But it's been a rough week, to say the least.  Mm-hmm.  I've been very agitated.  Can't stand up straight.  Yeah.  Like I'm bent over like a 65-year-old man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's just sucked.  All right?  So, uh...  So, you procured... 
[00:07:00]  Well, let's say...  Well, I've got to back up.  I had a certain procedure recently.  Yeah.  And I was sent home with some of the really, really tame Valium, Anthony.  How is that new vagina working?  Oh, not that procedure.  I'm sorry.  I remember your eyes.  Yes.  Yes.  So, I had one left over from the procedure.  Mm-hmm.  Didn't even need it.  Painless.  No, it was the...  It was...  It's the Wimpy Valium.  It wasn't even the heavy-duty stuff. 
[00:07:30]  Mm-hmm.  You know, the stuff that makes you a little sleepy.  Right.  So, I had one pill left over.  Right, Anthony?  Yeah.  And I was just saving it up for a great occasion.  You know what I'm saying?  Sure.  Sure.  I know you were debating on what to use it for.  You were going to use it on the flight out to California.  Correct.  But you didn't use it.  No.  No.  To mellow you out for the...  No, because...  I mean, when it comes to drugs and alcohol, Ed knows I'm a wimp.  You know?  Yeah.  I mean, we'll do some of these road shows, sure.  I'll chug a few beers.  I'll get a nice buzz.  Mm-hmm.  You know, but in general, I don't partake that much. 
[00:08:00]  No.  I think you could agree with me, right?  Absolutely.  When it comes to having colds or allergies, I don't really like taking the NyQuil or the  Benadryl.  It knocks me out bad.  Yeah.  Don't even do that.  But I had this Valium.  Valium.  The big V.  This one lousy pill.  Mother's little helper.  And it was a big deal in my house.  Real big deal.  Yeah.  You know, it was always there, like, ooh, the Valium.  Mm-hmm.  I believe Sandy was checking every day, wondering when I was going to take this one Valium that  just happened to be laying around the house from a leftover procedure there. 
[00:08:30]  So, finally, I just, I was really, really, like, tired one weekend.  I needed a little help.  So, I said, screw it.  Uh-oh.  You know, like on a Saturday or something.  I think that's what I used it for.  All right?  Yeah.  So, I did.  No big deal.  Finally got rid of all the Valium in the house.  It wasn't much to begin with.  It was like two or three pills.  Total.  Now, now, where do you cop your, uh, now, now you're, you're out.  And most of it was used for the stupid procedure to help, you know, help me through the first 
[00:09:00]  day, whatever.  Okay?  So, uh...  So, now you're sitting there jonesing for more.  Yeah, that's me.  That's me.  But I guess that's how it starts, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, so, uh, everyone knows I've had this really, really, really bad back since Monday.  I'm in excruciating pain.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Ouch.  Yeah.  And...  Ouch.  And let's just say, um, without getting anyone in trouble, we have some, some, uh, very faithful 
[00:09:30]  listeners, Anthony.  Right.  Very, very faithful listeners.  Yes.  That are willing to break some federal laws.  Correct.  Not saying what I'm about to say is true, but what the hell?  Well, everything we do on here is some kind of a wacky radio bit.  That's right, Anthony.  This is no different.  This is just a fabricated story for your entertainment based on nothing.  There's no facts going out over here.  This never even really happened.  So, let's just say, uh, a certain faithful listener heard that I was in some severe back 
[00:10:00]  pain.  Yeah.  And decided to, uh, maybe bring by enough Valium to kill an elephant.  Let's just say.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Is that, uh, pretty close to the truth?  Safe to assume.  Safe to assume.  Safe to assume.  The truth as it would be here on this wacky, untruthful radio show.  Right.  Don't take anything we say as, as real or truthful.  Of course.  It's entertainment purposes only. 
[00:10:30]  So, uh, I, being very paranoid about drugs in general, said there's no way I could take  a full prescription bottle filled with Valium home.  No, you don't want that in your house.  That's definitely how things get rolling on the road to being Chevy Chase or, uh, Jerry  Lewis.  There could have easily been hundreds.  Yeah.  To the point where, uh, the entire staff here at, uh, NAW's pissed at me that I didn't take  the full prescription bottle and hand them out.  Like they would take tax, right. 
[00:11:00]  Psycho Mark was so pissed off at you.  Right.  So, me being paranoid, I'm like, you know what?  My back does hurt.  This will help me sleep at night.  Yeah.  So, I took a total of four and a half pills, Anthony.  Four and a half.  Four and a half.  Now, not at once.  No, no, no, no, no.  This is what you took home with you.  Yeah, because these were the heavy duty ones.  These are like the 10 milligrams.  These will put you in la-la land.  Just one.  All right.  So, I, uh, I crashed in the city the other night, and I took a half a pill. 
[00:11:30]  Out cold.  Woke up at 10.  Woke up, uh, 10 the next day completely drooling on myself.  Half a pill.  It allowed me to sleep.  I didn't have to worry about the back pain.  I was able to do a fine radio show with my pal, Anthony.  The miracle that is valiant.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  That was Wednesday.  We're now up to Friday.  I still have four pills left.  Four pills.  So, you took one half of a pill.  One half of the pills.  Okay.  Right.  Of the hundreds I could have had that I initially said, there's no way I could have this much. 
[00:12:00]  So, now, where does the scene come in where Sandy is mad at you to the point where it seems like she walked in on you while you were tying off and cooking your works?  Yeah.  She's convinced I'm the new Elvis Presley.  So, she was away for a few days.  And I was playing PlayStation last night.  Mm-hmm.  Sort of waiting up for her.  Yeah.  I'll get in trouble if I said I was waiting up for her because she knows I'd like to stay up late to play my PlayStation game there.  Hot shots. 
[00:12:30]  Exciting hot shots.  Where was she then?  She wasn't home, Opie.  Story number 38.  If you guys only know, man.  Well, do you want me to say?  Sure.  Where was she?  Well, my girlfriend was driving your soon-to-be ex-wife to Boston to see her sick mom.  It doesn't put me in an awkward situation whatsoever.  In the car that Opie bought her.  Right.  Right. 
[00:13:00]  Opie has more dealings with my soon-to-be ex-wife than I do.  Right.  How did you get saddled?  My God.  Oh, my God.  It doesn't put me in an awkward position when I find out that my girlfriend's driving your soon-to-be ex-wife up to Boston.  Right.  I'm sure you're happy to hear something like that.  Well, it wasn't me.  I'm just happy when it ain't me.  So, she got home last night around 12.30.  Mm-hmm.  And she was all like, oh, I miss you. 
[00:13:30]  I miss you.  Everything was like, she was really, really in a good mood, right?  Yeah.  And I still had my overnight bag from staying in the city.  And she usually goes through it.  So, I'm like, ah, might as well just tell her.  All right, I got some value.  Oh, no.  Oh, that's, that, that's, ooh, I almost said it, that someone may have stopped by the station with.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Right.  Immediately, she's in a horrible mood.  She's in a huff now because you are a drug fiend. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  Me and my four Valium pills that are now in this little prescription bottle.  Four.  Now, let me tell you, for how little you drink, Sandy drinks even less.  Right.  Sandy, barely a glass of wine on very rare occasions, very health conscious, always at the gym.  Right.  No, no drugs there.  She's getting better.  She's up, she's up to a few glasses of wine now.  Oh, yeah?  We're getting there.  Interesting.  So, I'm like, ah, screw this.  I'm just like, ah, whatever.  I just went to bed. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  She comes upstairs, and now we're having small talk and stuff, and actually things are getting okay again.  I told her about the few days of radio we had, how much fun we've been having.  Sure.  I asked about her little trip to Boston.  Everything's fine.  Right.  Now, it's like 1.30.  And do I stay up to 1.30, even on weekends?  Not unless you have a brand new PlayStation game.  Right.  Or you're doing drugs.  So, I made the mistake of saying, boy, I'm really tired.  Oh, it's 1.30 in the morning, 1.15, whatever. 
[00:15:00]  Gee, that is an ammo for a nice smart-ass remark comeback.  And the smart-ass comment from Sandy was, was, what, is the pill-taking effect?  Oh!  It's a little joke.  She's riding me over four lousy Valium pills, and I didn't even take one last night.  And to tell you the truth, I should have.  I should have taken one last night.  I should have taken one Thursday.  But that's how paranoid I am. 
[00:15:30]  If I could have lifted my arm, I'd have smacked her.  So, now, like, she thinks I'm like the new Elvis Presley.  That I'm a pill-popper.  Oh, stop.  I hope he's not taking them.  He's dealing.  That's why he's only got so much.  A lot of people are very pissed around here that I didn't take the full bottle, but.  Very good, though, because that's how things start.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's how problems start. 
[00:16:00]  It's all very innocent.  I don't think, like we were saying, Chevy Chase.  I don't think he grabbed a full bottle of pills and just started popping them like Tic Tacs.  Yeah.  It starts like, oh, yeah, okay.  Well, this will help.  Yeah.  I got the back pain.  But, no, I'm really a little leery about this.  Pop one.  Oh, the pain is gone.  Oh, it feels good, too.  Oh, it's coming back a little bit.  Before you know it.  You got any more of those? 
[00:16:30]  No.  Do you really see me going that route ever?  No, but I don't think, I think, see, I don't think anybody sees anyone going that route.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It just happens.  And before you know it.  You're done.  The fact is, I was too paranoid to take, you know, take him last night or the night before.  Hudson from Ocean Grove, New Jersey.  Hey, Ope, the first step to recovery is admitting there's a problem.  Yes.  This is our little intervention show where we have all of Opie's close friends and family tell him, 
[00:17:00]  No, Opie, you don't need it.  You're worth more than that.  You're somebody.  Colonel Tom from Graceland checking in.  Oh, that's how my buddy Elvis started.  Just a wacky fan one day, fat, bloated, and dead the next.  See?  I'm going to become the fat, bloated Opie soon.  I'm going to start coming in to work with those jumper suits on.  How are you doing?  Practicing kung fu moves in the hallway with my big gut.  Lord, I'm all right.  You're my damn bunch of rice. 
[00:17:30]  Oh.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Wise men say, holy fools rushin', but I can't help the falling in earth with you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Mom.  Turn my blue suede shoes brown.  A hunk of hunk of burnin' butt.  A hunk of hunk of cranky ass. 
[00:18:00]  So that's my cute little story.  Yeah, they don't want to find you bloated on the bowl, dead, like they found Elvis.  Big, big turd in the toilet bowl.  You're dead.  Hey, where are my banana and peanut butter sandwiches that I ordered a while ago, by the way?  I added in the drunk part, uh, in lieu of cocaine.  Whoever thinks they're dying at the booth, it's always the cup. 
[00:18:30]  God, get me through this.  I'll never do it again.  Never, ever, ever do it again.  Just let me see morning.  Oh, if they find me like this, it's going to be so embarrassing.  Oh, I got an acorn for a shween.  Oh, I'm crapping.  I'm naked.  I got a tie around my neck.  I'm hanging from the door.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay, I'm feeling better.  Whew.  Feeling a little better. 
[00:19:00]  I think, I think I'm going to make it through this one.  Where did I leave the rest of that bowl?  Ah, that stuff was evil.  Oh, man.  Let's go to, uh, Debra.  Hi, Debra, what's up?  Hey, guys, how are you?  Good.  Very good.  I completely understand how you feel about pills.  Last year, I got rear-ended and thrown across an intersection, and I hurt my back, and they  gave me two or three different types of muscly lactors, Percocet, and anti-inflammatories. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  All my friends are like, give it to us.  If you're not taking it, and I'm like, no, no, no, I don't, I'm paranoid, I'm paranoid.  I took one Percocet, and I thugged out.  I went, like, berserk.  They had to rush me to the hospital.  Oh, really?  Wow.  Yeah.  What happened?  You just freaked?  I just freaked out.  I started hysterically crying, I'm going to die, I'm going to die.  And they were just like, my mom took me to the hospital. 
[00:20:00]  They thought I OD'd, and I'm like, I only took one, because I can't even drink.  If I have one drink, I'm buzzed.  Like, I have low tolerance to all drugs.  Wow.  All right, Debra, thank you.  You guys rock.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Someone giving you some sound advice.  Hugs, not drugs.  Those sayings were, just say no.  Alan, what's going on?  Hey, listen, I just want you to learn one phrase, okay?  Yeah.  Let's see if you can repeat after me.  Okay. 
[00:20:30]  Hi, I'm Hopi, and I'm an addict.  Okay?  You ready?  I'm going to send you some meeting lists.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Take a couple of meetings.  Yeah, you know.  I've been clean now for a month.  Feeling good.  Listen, you've got to plaster those bumper stickers all over the back of your car one  day at a time.  One day at a time.  One day at a time.  Easy does it.  Just say no.  You've got to know your limits.  Here's your brain.  Here's your brain on drugs.  Yeah.  Thank you, Alan.  Hey, can I get a shirt?  Ah, we don't have it. 
[00:21:00]  Come on.  We sold them for drugs.  Yeah.  Right.  We're pawning everything.  Hey, one for three, two for five.  All right, Alan.  Thank you.  One for three, two for five.  Right?  I thought I saw you in Washington Square Park.  Yeah, that was me.  Hey, one for three, two for five.  Trips?  Trips?  Trips.  Come on, guys.  All right, Alan.  Do me a solid.  Thank you.  We really don't have any.  We're going to have some shirts in the springtime.  All right.  Which means any week now.  You got it.  All right, man.  All right.  Bye-bye. 
[00:21:30]  Bye.  Someone's saying we ought to rename the show the Trainspotting and Anthony show.  All right, so I'm going into the Fat Opie stage.  Yeah.  Jumpsuits, really bad sunglasses.  A big beer belly.  I got to start dating 14-year-olds now, too.  We'll be back with Opie behind the music.  All started with a back pain.  Back pain.  Suddenly, his world went into a tailspin.  When we return, Opie hits rock bottom, but finds a way to climb back. 
[00:22:00]  And he meets Anthony for the first time in 10 years.  He's putting out a new album.  There's Anthony sitting at a picnic table.  Hey, man.  You know, we had something going in New York, and you screwed it up with the drugs.  Right.  Now I'm in a wheelchair.  Man.  We had it going, brother.  Right. 
[00:22:30]  What'd you do, man, with the drugs?  I'm sorry, man.  And when we return, their first show together after Opie's battle with addiction.  The show is at some tiny little radio station in, like, Akron, Ohio.  Hi, guys.  I just want to say, Opie, you're brave, and you're a hero, and you should be looked up to.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  The show blows monkey ass.  And, like, it's just calls saying how cool you are by kicking the drugs behind the music. 
[00:23:00]  So I figured I'd share today.  There you have it.  When we return, Opie and Anthony back together on the radio after Opie's battle.  Opie's addiction to drugs.  Hey, how you doing?  W-E-Z-E.  Real, son.  Here in Phoenix, Arizona, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:23:30]  5.40 a.m. on your dial.  It's your Arizona sound, Opie and Anthony, trying to rebuild our careers after Opie's drug addiction.  Oh, that one worked, Rick.  Time is 2 in the morning.  We're doing overnights.  All right.  Here's where I was going.  All right, well.  Oh, look at that one. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I learned it from you, Opie, okay?  I learned it from you.  All right, we got to take a break, Anthony.  I'm proud to say I'm drug-free today.  It's been two days.  It's been two days.  Two days.  Opie Play-Doh.  Two and a half days.  Opie in the role of Dana Play-Doh.  I know how, oh, whatever.  What?  It's just such a wimp.  I didn't even take the full pill when I was in town.  Half.  What did you cut it in half with? 
[00:24:30]  What?  Did you crunch it up in a little spoon like Mommy did with the St. Joseph's baby ash?  I took my stupid nail and just like, and cut it in half.  That's how paranoid I was.  I'm such a...  Yeah, he has the big long Coke fingernail.  That's funny.  All right, we got to regroup.  Enough of that.  It's stupid.  Syndication now, man.  We're back together.  Yeah.  It's 2008.  212-757-1027. 
[00:25:00]  Anne-Marie standing by.  She's got, like, a little review of the filter show from last night.  Fax line if you want to send in an FU.  212-957-9639.  We'll be back.  Opie in the day.  This is debauchery mania.  Prostate exams for everyone.  1-0-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  I'll tell you something.  If I get hit with any stray things that are being thrown at anybody for any reason, 
[00:25:30]  I'm going to lose my mother-effing mind.  You know how it is.  I go crazy.  Don't like being hit with stray objects.  That's why I don't throw things.  Because I don't want to be hit with things.  Thank you.  I've spoken my piece.  The psycho market and I have a war going on.  Yeah, there's something going on.  There's a lot of tension.  I'm loaded with CDs that we no longer play here at N.E.W.  One went sailing and just missed his head.  Let's go to Anne-Marie. 
[00:26:00]  Hey.  What's up, Anne-Marie?  I went to the focus show last night.  How was it?  Awesome, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  My friend got tickets from another radio station.  Don't mention the name.  All right.  And I was like, hey, you want to go?  She was like, yeah, okay.  So first night I think it was Snake River Conspiracy.  They were pretty good.  Uh-huh.  And Verka Salkin, and they sucked.  I was yelling, okay, horrific, between songs.  Uh, you got to give Verka Salkin a break.  They're really forming that damn band.  Yeah.  I don't like them that much. 
[00:26:30]  They're so picantin.  They're just awesome.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  They're right next to the speaker.  Yep.  My ear's still ringing.  Filter definitely rocks.  Yeah.  We want to thank those guys for stopping by the show earlier.  Yeah, it was cool.  Richard Patrick and Gino.  Yeah, he's talking bottles of water out into the crowd.  Cool.  Well, I'm glad you enjoyed the show, Anne-Marie.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Okay, bye.  All right, bye.  Let's go to Chris real fast.  Chris, what's going on?  What's going on?  How are you?  I went to the filter show last night.  It sucked.  It sucked?  It sucked. 
[00:27:00]  They suck.  They don't suck.  They all suck.  You suck, they, so they all suck.  Let's play Stoner Stoneby.  All right.  Hey!  Thank you, Chris.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  There was just 15 minutes of fame.  Bridget from Make Bridget Cry, and of course, Bridget was in a few days ago.  She got waxed for the first time in the other studio.  How are you, Bridget?  Hey, guys.  Hi, Bridget.  Hi, Bridget.  How are you?  What's bothering you today?  Um, not, I'm sorry to make you repeat yourself. 
[00:27:30]  Can you say what happened on Tuesday, please?  Um, I missed it.  First, get your tape rolling.  No, I wouldn't do that.  Uh, nothing happened on Tuesday, Bridget.  Why?  What are you hearing?  Yeah, what's the problem?  Please just tell me.  Why?  What did you hear?  We want to know what you heard.  You seem to be a little upset.  Just what's on the studio board.  I, I came, oh, just tell me, please.  To tell you if we actually saw your patch? 
[00:28:00]  No, just, just tell me what happened.  You should have told me when I was there.  That, that would have been so much better than reading it on a studio board.  What did, what did the studio board say about your waxing?  That, just, I just want to know what happened.  What did the studio board say?  I haven't read the studio board in the last few days.  It said, it said that there was a camera and the cabinet got closed.  There was a camera and the cabinet got closed?  What does that mean?  Hmm. 
[00:28:30]  Okay.  Now, when, oh, look, you sound upset now.  I just want to know what happened.  You sound like you're getting upset.  I'm, I'm, I'm trolling the, uh, studio board here.  I'm trying to see.  So, the studio board's saying that there may have been, like, some kind of hidden camera  as you were getting waxed?  Right, and I should have known better, and that's fine.  I just want to know what happened.  You let me leave for two days.  I was so happy.  I felt like, I don't know, you, you, you should have just told me then. 
[00:29:00]  Well.  You know, that's, I mean, yes, I should have known better.  That's fine.  What, known better?  Then to do what?  You didn't do anything.  You got waxed.  You got waxed.  You're not going to tell me?  You got waxed and we whack.  Do you honestly think we would hide a camera in a closed room that you were going to take  your clothes off?  Oh, you were?  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  That does sound like something to, uh...  Well, why didn't you check the studio before, uh...  I thought we started.  Yeah, Rick said you did.  I did.  Okay, so where, where could this, uh, camera have been?  Allegedly.  Where would this camera be, Bridget?  When Psycho Mark came back in right before we started and did some stuff in the cabinet.  Come on, I'm not stupid, just tell me what happened, please.  We wouldn't do something as legal as that.  Wait, get Psycho Mark in here.  So, you're saying that just before you're waxing, just before you got nude, after you 
[00:30:00]  checked the studio for a hidden camera, uh, Psycho Mark just happened to go into that  studio to do something in the cabinet?  Forget the legality.  Just tell me what happened, please.  I just want to know, please.  You want to know if there's a videotape of you...  No, actually, I want to know why you didn't tell me while I was there.  Well, because...  Because we wanted to watch it first.  You considered it was taping? 
[00:30:30]  Huh?  We didn't say it was taping.  You suck.  And what picture did you show somebody?  What picture?  You guys...  Oh.  I wish you'd just tell me.  I'm really not pissed, because I should...  It's fine.  I mean, why would I have checked the room for cameras if I didn't think you would do that?  If you're not pissed, can you come in again so we could get a good copy of this?  It was only the spaz cam.  No, just kidding.  Bridget.  Bridget.  Bridget.  Just tell me. 
[00:31:00]  Just tell me.  Just repeat what you said yesterday that made that go on the studio board.  Repeat what you said yesterday.  It sounds like she's got the Panasonic rolling in front of her studio.  No, I swear.  I swear.  We were just trying to make a radio first and broadcast it over the Jumbotron in Times Square.  Yeah, right.  Bridget.  What?  Get Psycho Mark in here.  Do you honestly think that we would do that?  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Yes, I do.  You do.  Do you think I'm tacky enough to do anything about it that you wouldn't just tell me the 
[00:31:30]  truth?  All right.  Listen.  Psycho Mark's in the studio.  You ask him, okay?  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, sugar.  You guys suck, please.  So, before the waxing, before you got nude, you checked the studio for hidden cameras,  right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And then you said Psycho Mark came in just before you got naked to do what?  To do something in a cabinet.  All right.  Well, Psycho Mark's here. 
[00:32:00]  Why don't you ask him what he was doing in the cabinet?  You guys want to repeat what you said yesterday?  Ask Psycho Mark.  What do you want us to repeat?  Psycho, I...  What did we say?  What did you hear?  I didn't hear anything.  Psycho Mark, what were you doing in that cabinet just before that bit?  Fixing some equipment.  I had to move a dat player for Pete.  Yeah.  For Don and Mike.  They were in there this week.  Yeah, plus I had to ask him to move something off the counter where we were setting up for 
[00:32:30]  her.  It's okay.  And since he did production stuff, I figured I'd let him do it.  It's okay.  Bridget, you need some Valium?  Yeah, I really do.  You sound like you're freaking out.  I'm not freaking out.  Eric, what's going on?  Ask, or Bridget, ask Psycho Mark why he's got a couple hundred dollars in his wallet today.  Why does he have a couple hundred dollars in his wallet?  Okay, I get it.  That's the money he got for putting the, pass along the photos, and now they're on the  internet. 
[00:33:00]  All right, she hung up.  Bridget hung up.  Come on.  Wait a minute.  I wish I had 400 bucks in my pocket.  All right, Bridget, call back.  Bridget is convinced that we might have had a hidden camera during her segment.  Bridget, there's no videotape of you getting undressed.  Don't worry about it.  Jay, what's going on?  Hello.  Hi, Jay.  What's up?  What's going on?  Where's Bridget?  She hung up.  Why'd she hang up?  Because I know she's on camera.  How do you know she's on camera?  Because I want to make her cry. 
[00:33:30]  No, no.  We've done that too many times.  Listen, I want to make her cry now.  You played make Bridget cry.  I had a bad day.  It's a good Friday.  It's been a bad Friday so far.  All right.  Well, I don't think she's calling back.  I don't either.  Bridget, call back.  We will tell you the truth.  Okay?  Thank you, Jay.  All right.  Do we have the girls coming in to get hot wax dripped all over their bodies today?  We have one girl.  Any other ladies want hot wax dripped on their body to show up at the station?  So far, we have one that's coming by, right? 
[00:34:00]  One.  One.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go to Joe Soprano from foundrymusic.com.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  How are you?  Hi.  You got to understand, because I type the studio updates as they happen.  I listen, and I just type, and I might have taken a couple of items out of context.  So maybe if Bridget is listening, I apologize.  You know, not to make her cry, you might put it.  So I might have put some erroneous information on there.  I don't know.  Maybe I might have heard wrong. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Well, I mean, I hope Bridget calls back.  We'll tell her the truth.  Yeah, I mean, you know, you guys are truthful.  And, you know, I don't think you'd be hiding anything, because you're truthful on this show.  And if anything was going on, you would come out and say it.  There you go.  Hey, Paisanos, great lunch specials.  Ah, there you go.  Hi there, guys.  Bridget's calling back.  All right, let's get Bridget on here.  Come on.  She's crying right here.  Bridget.  What?  What's wrong?  What? 
[00:35:00]  Bridget.  Bridget?  Are you crying?  Yes.  Oh, that didn't take too long.  Bridget, don't cry.  Bridget, no one taped you.  There's no videotape of you naked.  There's no pictures of you naked.  I don't, you, I knew that could have happened, but that's not what I was pissed about.  I left there, I had a great two days thinking, you know, Opie, you told me people were emailing 
[00:35:30]  and I was struggling out again and why am I shy?  Don't worry about it.  You're freaking out.  There's nothing for you to be concerned about.  Nothing happened.  Because we have a bunch of retards that work for our show.  That's the only reason.  But anyway.  It's okay.  I wish you would.  You wish what?  I wish you would have told me, man.  Bridget, I could tell you.  I could have stuck up for myself or something.  Bridget, I could tell you.  There are, there is no video of you naked. 
[00:36:00]  None.  It's not even the point.  Huh?  It's not even the point.  Well, what's the point?  What's the point?  That's what you're worried about and paranoid about it, I'm telling you.  No, because if there is, there's nothing I can do about it.  There isn't.  There isn't.  There's nothing of you.  There's no videotape existing of you.  Don't worry.  I'm not.  Any videotape that is of you, you have consented to out in the waiting room or whatever.  I know.  That's, that's.  Don't you worry about it. 
[00:36:30]  I don't know how else to tell you there is no video of you naked virgin as you were getting your waxing.  That's fine.  It's not the point.  Okay.  What's the point?  What's the point?  That we didn't tell you what?  That two days later we were going to get on the air and say that we had videotaped you?  We were going to tell you that two days before?  We didn't even know.  We made up the story.  Right.  Brian, what's going on?  No, we didn't.  Yeah, I got a big F you going on to YouTube.  Why?  Because you guys got videotaped and you're not sharing. 
[00:37:00]  We don't.  I'm seeing you all virgin, Opie.  We don't have video.  Oh, come on, man.  We don't have video.  No, you guys are wrong.  All right, Brian.  Bye.  All right, Bridget, do not listen to what Brian just said.  We do not have any video of you.  How many times have you cried on this show, Bridget?  At least three or four times.  Jay, what's going on?  Jay, I just copped some video on her.  What do you mean?  On the 42nd, there's something in the video. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, please.  Yeah, she's not a virgin.  I can see that.  Why you guys said she was a virgin?  There's no video.  Hey, Bridget.  Yeah?  You getting any stubble yet?  All right, you guys suck.  No.  No?  All right.  No.  No.  All right.  You want to...  So do you believe us?  No.  You have to believe us.  Yeah.  Well, fine.  I don't believe you, but...  We have no video of you. 
[00:38:00]  Do you remember one of the ladies closing the cabinet?  No.  Hmm.  Just ask you.  Do you?  Yeah, we do.  Yeah, we do.  No.  Tell me about her closing the cabinet.  What?  Tell me about her closing the cabinet.  What happened?  You guys suck.  What happened?  All I can say is, you know, she just wanted to get comfortable and she closed the cabinet 
[00:38:30]  before she started waxing you, because I guess the cabinet was in her way.  That's all I'm trying to say.  So what did you see?  Huh?  What did you see?  Nothing.  What did you see?  Nothing.  Bridget.  We are messing with you.  What, Anthony?  What?  Don't you think if we had done something like that, that we would have told you right  after you got out of the room?  I would think so.  It took us two days to think, oh, if we would have had a camera in there, we could have taped  her. 
[00:39:00]  And then, oh, let's say that we taped her.  No, no.  See, that's why it's lame, because you waited two days to say it.  Yeah, well, what?  We didn't think of it when you were still here.  Whatever.  Bridget.  What?  There's no tape of you naked.  Don't worry.  I'm not.  And you could shut your little tape recorder off.  Oh, that's so tacky.  Yeah, it is.  You're dealing with a lot of lawyers.  That's not my problem.  Don't push that at me.  Then why would you try to get us to repeat something? 
[00:39:30]  Right.  Bridget.  I wouldn't do that, I swear.  Well, you are doing that.  You're saying, tell me what you said.  I was trying to figure out what you guys said yesterday that made that go on the studio  board.  Not like, repeat it so I can tape it.  Repeat it so I was there.  I wanted to at least hear what you said yesterday.  I wanted to know what happened.  Nothing.  The cabinet closing.  Nothing happened.  Nothing happened, Bridget.  Okay? 
[00:40:00]  Okay.  That is the God's honest truth.  I don't believe you, but I'm going to hang up now.  No, that's the God's honest truth.  That's fine.  There is no naked video of you.  Nothing happened.  Don't have to worry.  Okay?  Okay, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye-bye, Bridget.  Bye-bye, Bridget.  From Make Bridget Cry.  You ain't seen O.P.  Wait a minute.  I have to teach you something, okay?  Let me teach you a little something. 
[00:40:30]  Deny.  Deny.  Deny.  There is no tape.  I don't know what you're talking about.  There wasn't a camera.  There was not a cigar.  Why is everyone running out of the studio?  Unbelievable.  All right?  There is no tape.  Now squirm in your seats. 
[00:41:00]  Come on, squirm.  And deny.  Two, three, four.  Deny.  Two, three, four.  Deny.  Looking good, people.  Get fit for deception with Bill Clinton's Lies of Steel.  All right, people.  Lie.

I told Lisa she's mad at us because we brought it up on the air already that we need new coffee.  Okay.  Let me...  She wants us to improvise.  She wants you using characters every day when we do the stacker two read, Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  Okay.  So I'll improvise.  Start now and you'll have it by summer.  Very good.  Look, I improvised the word spring to summer.  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah.  Obviously, the people writing the copies, the copy has to take stacker two.  So they have some energy to write some new copies.  I'm glad you're saying it because he was so pissed at me when I said it the other night.  Well, I think you know what the deal is.  You got to lose weight, stacker two.

It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Anthony, do you hear who's coming to town?  Santa Claus just announced.  Oh.  Could be the show of the summer to see.  Stone Temple Pilots and the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone.  Rock.  All together this summer playing the PNC Arts Center.  July 31st.  Jones Beach on August 12th.  Hopefully we'll have tickets for that show to give away a little later on.  Nice.  In the spring and early summer, right? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  A lot of great shows starting to shape up.  Matter of fact.  We were talking about the Metallica show.  Yeah.  Did you hear this lineup for Giant Stadium?  Metallica, Korn, Kid Rock, Power Man 5000, System of a Down.  Hey, there's one to bring the kids to.  July 20th at Giant Stadium.  And that's going to be absolutely huge.  Where are they going to have the human sacrifice?  Midfield?  Probably, right?  Right around where Jimmy Hoff is buried.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  Page and the Crows coming back to town.  You've got the Oz Fest, which is a great lineup, too.  And others.  There you go.  But the big news, Stone Temple Pilots, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fishbone, PNC Arts Center,  July 31st.  Jones Beach, August 12th.  Hopefully we'll get more bands on the Opie and Anthony show in the near future, Anthony.  Yeah.  We did well with Filter this week, right?  Yes.  What are you pointing at?  Oh, Mike?  Yeah.  Hello, hello, hello. 
[00:46:00]  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  What's up?  Who's this?  It's Mike.  Hi.  Yeah, I just had a couple things to say about the Don and Mike.  Oh, you thought it was Mike?  No.  Some people were calling Don and Mike up and telling them that you guys are really bad-mouthing  them and vice versa.  I heard that.  I heard that on my way home the other night.  And as far as, I was listening to them the day that they actually sent those cannolis  over to you.  Yeah.  And they knew right from the bat.  They said, ah, they'll think it's from us.  And they were doing it as a joke. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  So they weren't trying to, like, reuse them or anything like that.  Now, we know.  But so many people are doing the, you know, trying to get you guys against them and them  against you.  Yeah, I know.  That's what it is.  Because I heard a caller the other night say that, hey, Opie and Anthony are saying  bad things about you.  And I'm driving in my car and I'm like, what did we say?  I'm talking on the radio like an idiot.  Yeah.  What did we say?  It didn't happen.  There's a lot of.  Like, all of a sudden, I think I could talk to the caller.  Oh, shut up.  Hang up on him.  Yeah.  There's a lot of sarcasm when we do our radio show.  Of course.  They're broadcasting two studios away from us right now. 
[00:47:00]  They're in New York again.  Yeah.  And we can get them on the phone.  I just enjoy listening to them.  And obviously, I've been listening to you guys for a long time.  I think we'll talk to them a little later.  That'll be good.  We abused them last week because we did send them a couple hot strippers with some alcohol.  Some Cristal Champagne.  Cristal Champagne.  And welcome them to New York.  And then we did, you know, abuse them because they sent back used cannolis.  Yeah.  You know, that isn't a bashing thing.  No, but as far as being bashed back and forth between them, no reason to have the bad blood. 
[00:47:30]  No, I go on the record as saying I like them.  I think they're funny.  Yeah, it's just kind of odd for a listener to be hearing, you know, to like two shows at once  and then hear them bash each other when it's really not true.  That's what it is.  Kind of annoying.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, we'll get them on the show later on, possibly.  Maybe you won't go to the Palm, but you've got to go somewhere with them and sit down on a decent level.  The Palm.  The Palm.  I know.  Well, they invited us to the Palm, which is a...  Too much.  Yeah, it's over-the-top Ritzy for Ant-Nine. 
[00:48:00]  Can I go to the Palm?  I want to know if I can go to the Palm.  Maybe we can bring Ken, our big boss, and I can sit down and get to know them better,  and maybe they will like me.  Put on Spaz's credit card.  There you go.  I think that's bit of the week, by the way, Spaz's credit card.  I think we're going to replay it at 5 instead of doing Spaz's Week in Review.  Cool.  We're going to take a break from that this week.  Guys, thanks very much.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right.  Take it easy.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  A lot of people convinced we have a damn video of Bridget. 
[00:48:30]  Jesus.  We put our candid camera in the studio as Bridget was getting waxed.  Laugh along as she thinks the waxer is a professional when indeed it is our own fanny flag.  Don't be surprised if sometimes somewhere someone steps up to you and says,  Hey, I saw your gants on the video that I bought on eBay.  From the old age, y'all. 
[00:49:00]  There is no video.  You know, but see, people just, you know, they just are convinced because they know us by now.  Say it enough, and it is true.  There is no video.  And we can say it until we're blue in the face and our damn listeners will not believe us.  There is no video.  Why?  No!  Look, look at it.  I'm going to be very sincere.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Stop making me laugh.  Okay.  There is no video of Bridget naked. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you.  Okay.  Right.  Your turn.  The listeners will believe.  We'll believe.  Okay.  Okay.  There is no video of Bridget naked.  There you go. 
[00:50:00]  Virgin.  Virgin.  You guys believe us, right?  Oh, you're very naughty.  Hey, are you going to say hi to your friend Fudd or what?  Hey, Fudd.  Hey, yeah.  Look at that.  My buddy, Fudd.  That's right.  It's like a goddamn flop house in here every day.  Bill Brady, Joe Gruen in yesterday, my brother, and now Fudd.  Rogues of society have wandered in.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Well, that's the entire band, I think.  Yeah.  Hey, Fudd, did you bring in a Columbine song today?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  All right.  Are you playing in that mess tomorrow night with the ass?  Yeah, I'll be behind the keyboards.  I will be tickling the ivory.  Yeah.  Tomorrow night, Sergeant Pepper's over there in Huntington, East Northport, wherever it  is, on Jericho Turnpike.  Opie, showing up?  I will be there, yes.  You will?  Yes, I'll be there, Anthony.  Now, am I going to be like the poor little kid that's putting on the third grade play, 
[00:51:00]  that's looking, squinting his eyes over the lights for his parents out there in the crowd?  Or will Opie be up front, beaming?  What?  I'll be there.  Where's Danny?  If you call me on stage to try to sing like you've done in the past, I will run out of  the place.  I would never do that.  You have done that.  We have tape of you singing.  Why would we want to bring you up to sing?  You made me go on stage once to try to sing with you. 
[00:51:30]  A little backup.  Yeah, a little backup.  Don't you play some of the skins?  Don't you do a little drumming?  I will not be performing tomorrow night.  Here, here's one of the songs that I think you've rehearsed.  Okay.  Yeah!  You ass.  I hate this.  Doing the best I ever did.  All the way.  Doing the best that I can.  All right, listen.  Listen, foot, don't laugh so hard.  Yes, sir. 
[00:52:00]  That was a hobble you to think you did, Ant.  So, Sergeant Peppers tomorrow night.  We'll all be there.  Ouch.  Yeah, super fly.  Supporting Anthony's cover band.  Don't feel bad, Ant.  You've got to hear me sing like the Linda McCartney of the band.  Are you inviting all the high schools?  Dude, you know what this is?  Unbelievable.  I'm just messing with you.  This is a bunch of us drunks getting together and just blowing out some tunes, having some fun.  This isn't a serious, hey, man, you know, we're trying to get signed, man. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  No, we're just going to drink and blow out a couple of tunes, hopefully.  All right.  On T.  Cool.  Yeah.  See what happens.  I'll meet a few people down there.  Did you hang out posters all over Huntington?  No.  No.  It's not like that.  It's not like the old, put some flies, man.  How many times did we get into arguments with Joe, my brother Joe?  My brother Joe was like the biggest, most serious, we got to get this band going thing 
[00:53:00]  when we were with Rotgut, really trying to make an effort at getting something going.  And we'd have these ridiculous meetings.  Before you go on, because you guys downplay it.  I mean, Rotgut was really, really good.  Yeah.  I think, you know, you got some play overseas and didn't have the luck.  You had a nice following.  And I'm serious.  You guys were ahead of your time.  The luck factor was not there.  And luck is a big thing when it comes to making it in music.  So we'd have these inane meetings with Joe about, yo, man, who's coming with me to pass 
[00:53:30]  the flyers out?  We're going this Saturday night, you know, 10 o'clock.  We're going to hit all the clubs when all the, but Joe, it's Saturday night.  We got lives and stuff.  Oh, you're not into it, man.  You're not into it.  Fine.  Then I'm not even going to deal with this anymore.  You know, I'm making a go with this.  Flyers.  What has a flyer in a windshield ever done for a band?  Do you think any band was made or broke on flyers in the windshield?  Guys, if you're in bands right now and you're sticking flyers in the windshield, you're 
[00:54:00]  wasting your frigging time.  Well, you know, the worst thing was Joe assigning me and Ant to flyer detail.  He gave us like 500 flyers.  What did we do?  Go down the street.  We throw them in the pail.  Hit a bar.  Yeah, come and get out.  Did you get rid of them?  Yep.  Yeah.  Like we're supposed to pass them out, to hand them out to people on the street.  I can't see you doing that ever.  Dude, it was ridiculous.  We took the whole pile, threw it in the garbage, hit a bar.  An hour later, we're like, whoo, yeah, it came all the way.  A little tank.  You know, but the way you make it is by playing and getting the right people to see you. 
[00:54:30]  Connections.  And a hell of a lot of luck.  If it doesn't happen, pan it on flyers ain't going to do it.  No.  No.  Vinny wants to know where Sergeant Peppers is.  Vinny.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, where exactly is Sergeant Peppers?  Jericho Turnpike between Elwood Road and Larkfield Road on that strip there.  What time are you going to be there Saturday night?  I don't know, 10 o'clock.  I believe it's going to be a packed hat.  Yeah, it's going to be packed. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, good, because if I get a chance, maybe I'll pop down with a free buddy.  Cool, man.  Thanks, Vinny.  Good.  Good luck if I don't make it.  All right.  Yeah, it's the first time you guys have gigged in a while, huh, Ed?  Oh, yeah, we don't practice or anything.  Hey, don't expect much.  I'm going to hopefully break out the Christina Aguilera set and really wow the people with that one.  Are you going to be wearing a belly shirt?  Yes.  And then we're going to do some NSYNC songs, some Backstreet Boys.  We worked on the moves.  All right, listen, you know, we've got to play the Columbine song one last time. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, no.  This song came in yesterday.  Anthony's brother, Joe, Cowbell Bill, and Anthony's sister guest on making her song parody debut.  A lot of people in shock over this next song you're about to hear, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  I don't think it glorified the shooting whatsoever.  You tell me this song glorifies the shooting and I'll, well, shoot.  No, I'll beat you over the head.  It doesn't.  It kind of just is a little chronicle of what happened a year ago. 
[00:56:00]  Mm-hmm.  The tragedy of Columbine.  But did he have to do it to the Patty Duke theme?  Well, the Patty Duke theme does make it a little wacky, but hell, it's a comedy show, not CNN over here, okay?  All right.  You know, go to CNN for a dick joke.  Don't come here for the news.  Understand?  That's our new motto, isn't it?  Well, let's play it.  Here it is, okay?  All right.  All right.  Here's Dylan, who liked an M-16 with high-capacity magazines. 
[00:56:30]  But Eric liked to build a thousand raise and all in Middleton.  What a crazy pair.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains all the way.  Shot up their school in Trench Coast one year ago today.  While Dylan picked out a chocolate stick, an effing Jew, some religious chick. 
[00:57:00]  Well, Eric goes out of control, he's driving up some baby rules.  What a couple of bricks.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains.  And you'll find.  They walked the leg.  They walked the leg.  They must have been held up too tight.  And they took their own lives.  They would kill us through Zach Columbine.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Crone men jumping all over each other. 
[00:57:30]  Okay, terrific.  1-8-2-7-71-W.  It's like a Mark Gordon Liddy.  Where are my plumbers?  There was no tape.  There's Mitchell.  I will not turn anything over to Judge Sarita.  I'm not a group.  Tapes? I know who wants the tapes. Those lousy Jews. 
[00:58:00]  All right, Andy, let's move on with the damn radio show, huh?  Goddamn.  Are we getting any faxes for this F.U. Friday?  Henry, Henry, they want the tapes.  Well, you'll have to give them the tapes, Mr. President, your mother.  But I can't, I have to deny any tapes of any foreign girl gash. 
[00:58:30]  Well, she was here on the official business with a vaccine.  Nothing could explain these tapes.  They don't exist.  Henry, you've got to get me out of trouble.  Let me say this about that.  Where's Liddy?  Liddy and the rest of the plumbers.  Oh, my God.  Hysterical.  I love this place.  I love working here.  This isn't the real world, is it?  It's an adventure a minute. 
[00:59:00]  Hey, Liz, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I want to know what Sandy said about you going to the basketball game.  Oh, yeah, my big Knick game on Sunday.  I'm blowing off Easter, blowing off two families to go to the Knick game.  Yes, playoffs against the Toronto Raptors.  Who the hell's going to guard Vince Carter?  Yeah, I'm going.  And to be honest with you, you know, Sandy was cool about it.  She was?  She was very cool about it.  She was kind of trying to figure out how she can get out of brunch, too. 
[00:59:30]  Really?  No, I've got to give her credit.  She was very cool about it.  That's cool.  I wish there was a bit here like she wasn't, but no, she said go, have fun.  All right, guys, love you.  Kind of a drag, because I was hoping there was a confrontation.  It would have gave us 20 more minutes of radio today, bud.  Yeah.  No, I will be at the Knick game Sunday instead of celebrating Easter.  All right.  With all the Jews.  Thanks.  All right, Liz.  Thank you.  All the Jews.  I will not lose my presidency over Bridgetgate. 
[01:00:00]  Bridgetgate.  Bill from CNN is on the line.  Bill, what's up?  Gentlemen, how are you this afternoon?  Bill from CNN.  Yes.  All right.  Yes, we were thinking.  We heard your song about the Columbine incident.  Yes.  I thought it was quite interesting, and I was thinking about sending a correspondent, like  maybe, hmm, I could send J.C. Ferraro down.  Nah, you don't want him.  He's gay.  Hmm, let me think. 
[01:00:30]  Hmm, I could send a good correspondent.  He's kind of short, kind of dopey.  No, no, no, that would be spaz.  Let me think.  Maybe an Al Zest.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, he's a dork.  Hey, where's this going, Bill?  Well, it's a damn good question there, Anthony.  It started off well.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Bill.  Good thing we don't tape these phone calls.  Oh, by the way, can you repeat what you said yesterday so that we could have an accurate  report of it?  I said nothing.  We said nothing.  Oh, okay.  Tally-ho, Diamond Dust. 
[01:01:00]  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  Who's deep throat?  And you know how you said it's never born?  Damn the Washington Post.  You know how you said it's never boring around here?  Yeah.  You know, I've got to explain to management that the only reason we're in radio is because  we never wanted real jobs.  Yeah.  But they're making radio more into a real job every day.  True.  With his 401k plans and dental plans.  You know, when radio first started, it was just a bunch of hippies smoking dope. 
[01:01:30]  Now, which side of yes you want to play now?  Right.  You know, it was in the DJ's hands.  There was never a guy walking around with a tie or anything.  Playlists.  Playlists.  It was just a bunch of guys that, you know, had no desire to be in the real world, wanted  to spin some tunes, you know, get the best pot available, and that's it.  Right.  But radio has become so damn corporate, it's not even funny.  We have business meetings, staff meetings. 
[01:02:00]  Big business.  401k plans, retirement plans we have to go over.  All this crap.  You have to go see people in human resources.  Human resources.  It's a radio station.  I need an arm.  That's a human resource.  Could you spare a foot?  What the hell is human resources?  You know, maybe for your job it's normal, but a radio station should not have a human resource  department.  We're a bunch of immature, like, third graders running around. 
[01:02:30]  We should have a drug dealer, not a human resource center.  We're here because we were irresponsible in our regular occupations.  Yeah, but they scare us.  I mean, every day it's getting more and more corporate, more and more people walking around  with suits.  Yeah.  You know?  Can I say hi to them in the hallway?  More levels of management.  There's a whole management hierarchy now in radio.  It's just getting out of hand.  Insane.  Well, the latest memo, and I got it in my hand.  Yeah.  Let me read a little bit of this one.  You guys are going to laugh. 
[01:03:00]  To the WNEW programming staff from Jeremy, who's our immediate boss.  Yes.  Referring the sexual harassment videotape.  Wow.  I don't know about that.  Doesn't exist.  Just videotape.  Where's Archibald Cox?  Hey, some last name you have, Archibald Cox.  Now, Gabriel's pissed because he works in human resources.  Gabriel, what's up?  Hey. 
[01:03:30]  Hey.  Gabriel.  There you go.  Hey.  There's your human resource.  What's up?  I'm a human resource.  If you want to know what we do, I can tell you what we do.  What do you do?  We help you keep your butt clean.  We keep you legally out of trouble, and we listen to you gripe all the time.  That's what we do.  I am?  Yeah.  I have no clue, still, what they do.  Yeah.  Leave me with your explanation.  We have never met the human resource lady here at the station.  We've been here two years because she doesn't like our show.  I'm convinced of that.  Well, you need to. 
[01:04:00]  Stop by.  She's probably very nice.  Uh, no, no, thank you.  She's for advocacy.  That's just the one that's going to fight for you to get a raise.  She ain't fighting for my raise.  Shut up.  Hey, I do it all the time.  Oh, fighting for a raise.  Get out of here.  She has nothing to do about us and our raises.  Another person with a job with an overblown sense of worth.  Everyone thinks their job is like the big friggin' thing, like when they try to, like human resources. 
[01:04:30]  If it wasn't for us, you wouldn't be working.  Shut up.  Hey, I didn't say you don't help my job a lot, but you've got to give us credit.  I don't want to help your job, and I don't want you to help mine.  Okay.  I don't even know what a human resource is.  I believe it's a made-up job.  It is.  It is.  It's one of those corporate jobs that fell through the cracks and should have been eliminated.  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm sure you'll say that whenever you guys get into a legal issue,  and you've got to call legal and HR to get your butt out of it.  In five years, I've never had to see a human resource person. 
[01:05:00]  Gabriel, wake up.  And we've been in trouble before.  We have corporate lawyers we deal with.  We don't deal with a human resource lady.  Well, human resources also partners with your corporate lawyers.  So whether or not you think you are or not, we are helping you.  You know what human resources is like?  Probably like your mom.  When you're in trouble at school and you've got to take your mom there.  That's what it is.  It's not really getting a good defense, right?  It's your mom trying to get you out of trouble.  All right?  Oh, okay.  Thank you, Gabriel.  Thank you, Mom.  Bye-bye. 
[01:05:30]  You know what I would do?  I'd call the human resources department right now.  Put them to work.  Look, we need new chicks.  Mark, what's going on?  Do something for the show.  We need the girls to drop hot wax on today.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Mark.  Run with it.  How you doing?  Good.  I love the show, big fan and everything, but I hope you're crying a little bit.  I mean, you guys got a great gig.  I'd kill for your job.  This is the best job in the world.  We understand – yeah, Mark, don't misunderstand us here.  We understand we have a great – we don't even call it a job.  I mean, we love what we do, but it's getting ridiculous how they're trying to make it into, like, real work. 
[01:06:00]  That's what, you know, makes us paranoid.  They're coming after me, Henry.  Real work sucks.  I agree with him.  You can have my job.  I mean, I work for an oil refinery.  It sucks.  Wow, cool.  Tell me when stuff blows up.  When stuff blows up?  Yeah.  Yeah, we haven't had that happen yet, but, you know, there's always a possibility.  All right, Mark.  All right, take it easy, guys.  Thank you.  I know.  I was in construction for many years, and, God damn, this job rocks.  Well, this is just funny. 
[01:06:30]  This memo was in our mailbox today.  I mean, if you know the show, you'll see where the humor is, okay?  This is a memo referring the sexual harassment videotape, Anthony.  Yes.  Our company has adopted a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment.  To educate us on this policy, the company has produced a 30-minute video.  All of us are required to view this video and to sign a piece of paper acknowledging that  we have viewed and understood the contents of that video, Anthony.  Yes.  The video, I'll warn you now, is boring and badly acted. 
[01:07:00]  Well-intentioned volunteers instead of professional actors.  Right.  And are these, this was made strictly for this company?  Yeah.  With volunteers from the company?  Probably.  Why didn't they choose us?  Right.  I'd have acted in that one.  Hey, baby.  Nice ass.  You know?  You're just walking around the cubicles.  Hey.  Hey.  Nice gas.  It's not proper for Anthony to touch with the girls' cans. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  All of a sudden, just come in and start tuning in Tokyo.  Yeah.  Hey, baby.  You just, all I have to do is, yeah, you look a little moist.  All I have to do is get some videotape from our show.  They didn't have to make a video.  You know?  I've got to see the video now just to laugh, because I'm sure it's just the guy around  the water cooler and various examples of sexual harassment.  Yeah.  Anyway, they say the video is boring, badly acted, but its message is clear and important.  You got that memo I was talking to you about, Christine? 
[01:08:00]  Please.  Okay.  Now just squat on my face.  That's it.  The memo goes on.  It says, tempting as it might be to poke fun.  And you must take its message seriously.  Seriously.  Can you see?  I'm going to go and see this video after all.  I've blown it off the last few years.  But this year, I'm going.  We all are going to sit in the front row.  It's going to be me, you, Rick, Psycho Mark, Ben, Spaz, and Stinky. 
[01:08:30]  I'm going to bring popcorn and soda.  Yeah, we should bring popcorn and soda.  Sit next to a girl that works for the company and cut the bottom of the popcorn out and stick  your...  You know how you do that old gag?  You put your junk through the bottom of the popcorn box in your lap.  You want some popcorn?  Oh, thank you.  What is that?  I guess you'll like your popcorn butter.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  We'll bring in a six-pack of beer.  Anyway, it says, at WNEW, we have some unique issues.  Oh?  Some things that might happen on air in the course of our shows remain acceptable.  Yes, we can say to a girl that walks into the studio, let me rub your ass.  Right.  But you can't do that upstairs in the offices.  Right.  However, off-air, in our business environment, we are all subject to the company policy.  Please see me if you have any questions or concerns about what behavior is acceptable.  I want to know if it's acceptable that we sit in our office with the door open, girls right 
[01:09:30]  outside, two feet away, and we yell the C word.  Every third word out of our mouths is the C word.  I have people that ask me, I don't know how you don't curse on the air every day.  Because off the air, every other word out of my mouth is the F word, and every word in  between that is the C word.  I'm just F-C, F-C, F-C.  All day.  So there you have it.  We have to go see a sexual harassment video, Anthony. 
[01:10:00]  Sexual company policy.  Screening of the video now, Monday, 11 a.m., 10th floor conference room.  Tuesday at 9.30.  Welcome to Movie Phone.  The sexual harassment video.  Tuesday, 9.30.  Our company has adopted a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment. 
[01:10:30]  To educate us on this policy, Infinity has produced a 30-minute video.  30 minutes of hot, steamy sexual harassment.  Everyone must come to the screening.  We'll be seated, boy, girl, boy, girl, so we can grope each other's crotch areas  during the hot, steamy sexual harassment video. 
[01:11:00]  Starring Anna Mall as the harassed bitch.  And Ron Jeremy as the boss.  See Ron Jeremy ask his secretary if she takes oral dictation.  And as the new temp employee, Peter North. 
[01:11:30]  You haven't seen sexual harassment like you'll see in the new sexual harassment video.  30 minutes of hot, steamy sexual harassment produced by Infinity Broadcasting.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Oh, you're very naughty ass.  See Dr. Zachary Smith harass his young employee.  Oh, dear.  Get me that vile young hairless boy ass. 
[01:12:00]  I gotta see this.  Ah, yeah.  See me with any questions concerning what behavior is acceptable.  So we gotta see this one?  Is it Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday?  Oh, you know what the conference room is like, too.  It's kind of small.  We're all gonna be laughing.  It's just gonna be a big joke.  Is anyone gonna sit there and take notes?  Oh, God.  Do you think there's gonna be...  If somebody whips out a notepad, I'm gonna sexually harass them. 
[01:12:30]  There's always one nerd you work with that will do that.  We'll take notes, Anthony.  First person pulls out a notepad.  Love snot to the back of the head.  There's your note.  We have better things to do with our time around here.  And the 35-minute director's cut.  I'll get there in 20 minutes early and put another video in.  Yeah.  Well, now, we got tape over it.  Hey, Mike, what's up? 
[01:13:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Real good.  You know what I mean?  I'm the headhunter.  I lost the money.  So I deal with human resource people every day.  Yeah.  They do absolutely nothing.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Okay?  Okay.  What they are is just a buffer for the higher-ups, in case there's a sexual harassment.  But I've been working in this business for 15 years.  I can tell you stories to turn your hair gray.  You talk about sexual harassment, there are CEOs chasing people around there, women around  their desk, locking them in the conference room and chasing them around the desk. 
[01:13:30]  To this day.  Oh, yeah.  A smash fee.  Well, thank you, Mike.  All right, guys.  All right, bye.  Hey!  So we're looking forward to that, I guess, huh?  Yeah.  The sexual harassment video.  The sexual harassment video.  Okay.  Monday.  When are you going?  You go Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday?  We got to all go at the same time.  We have to. 
[01:14:00]  Monday is too early.  It'll be a scream.  I'm going to sit there.  I love the movies.  Ha, ha.  Ah.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Captain Carl.  Captain Carl.  I got something on the back of your head.  Sorry, Mr. Vaughn.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Randy's online.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I just got a quick suggestion for your sexual harassment movie. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Well, if you bring your girlfriends and make out during it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Dress them up like employees.  Yeah, there you go.  Dress them up like secretaries.  Hey, baby.  Bend you over the file cabinet.  Hey, Anthony, I'll probably see you tomorrow down there in Peppers.  All right, Randy.  Okay.  Later, man.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Randy.  Yeah, bend the employees.  You've got to watch it, bent over a file cabinet.  It's the best way to watch it. 
[01:15:00]  I want to know if it's even relevant in this atmosphere, like for us.  Is it?  I don't know.  Should people even be working on this floor if they have a concern about sexual harassment off or on the air?  You guys don't even know the stuff that goes on outside that studio door.  Yeah.  Why do you think they ought to paint the walls of the studio and the offices in the hallway?  Spunk. 
[01:15:30]  Jesus.  All right, we're out of our minds today.  Let me lube that up.  That's a good porn shot.  That's the prison shot.  That's when you know you're going to get it in the laundry room.  Yeah.  When Bubba behind you goes,  whoosh.  Ouch.  Right.  Yeah, before the painter came in, we had scratch and sniff walls. 
[01:16:00]  Whoa!  Okay.  Yeah.  Scots.  Ouch.  Okay.  Virgin.  Ouch.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  I'm going to take it very seriously.  All right, man.  Spaz will be the one taking notes.  Notes.  The brown noser of the show.  Remember the chick that used to work here?  Always taking notes in the lame meetings we used to have with our old bosses? 
[01:16:30]  Mm-hmm.  About what format we were going to have for the next three hours?  Mm-hmm.  She'd be jotting notes down.  We're just sitting there totally goofing on it.  Take notes.  We had people take notes on Two for Tuesday.  Yeah.  How to execute Two for Tuesday the correct way.  Should we come out of the second twofer that we play with a twofer bumper, or should we  go right into spots?  You don't know how much our heads were ready to explode.  We'd be sitting in this meeting. 
[01:17:00]  We're like, drooling, and meeting's over.  It's like, okay, you're just ready to pop out of your seat.  Anyone have any questions?  And three dweebs' hands would go up.  So, after we come back from a break, should we do the N.E.W. positioning bumper, or should  we talk over the intro to the song, and then maybe play the bumper after the song?  Yeah.  You know, because I'm thinking it sounds a hell of a lot better if we... 
[01:17:30]  What are you doing?  They were all legends, though, Anthony, you know?  They were all legends.  Legends.  Now they're asking questions elsewhere.  Oh, yeah, you bring an interesting question to this.  I'm posing on Friday on the queue of the day.  All right.  Yeah, and the funny thing is, we were trying to do this just wild, outrageous, fresh radio, 
[01:18:00]  and we had to deal with that crap in the meetings.  How to execute a two-for-Tuesday.  I'm glad we executed it.  I'm telling you how to execute it with a big blade.  Flopped the head off.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We're blowing off Spaz's Week in Review today because Spaz is a bit of the week.  He topped himself, yeah, and we don't want to totally...  We don't want to turn the whole show into Spaz.  But coming up, I mean, honestly, it's unbelievable when Spaz came into the show earlier this week 
[01:18:30]  and said that he wants to get closer to me in particular and the show  and then went off on a tangent telling us how he spent $743 one night at the St. Regis.  Yeah.  Unbelievable radio.  Yes, very good.  I just got to clear something up quickly.  I'm getting an instant feedback saying how I'm ripping off a certain personality here in the city  by doing the Dr. Smith impression that was done years ago. 
[01:19:00]  I'm not ripping him off.  I'm ripping off Billy West, who did it very well years ago.  Thank you.  Get it straight.  Oh, dear.  Someone else said we were ripping off someone, too, because we played a CD this week as well.  Ouch.  We're ripping someone else off because we played a CD.  Hmm.  The same CD as somebody else. 
[01:19:30]  That's interesting.  That's very interesting.  All right.  Ouch.  All right, we'll be back.  Stay there.  Are you mad at us, Lisa?  No.  How can I ever get mad at you, boys?  Hmm.  You sure you're not mad at us, Lisa?  I'm not mad at you.  I heard you were yelling and screaming in the hallway about us.  You know, it is your job to get creative.  See?  And you can skip right over the spring line, you know. 
[01:20:00]  I'm fixing it right now, though, so you never make that mistake again.  Can I, uh...  Am I doing this, Ben?  I thought you said you weren't mad at us.  I'm not mad at you.  You sound a little irritated, Lisa.  Everything okay?  Lisa, we'll do a creative spot for Stacker 2 right now for you.  Your spots are great, boys.  I love you dearly.  I hope you have a very happy Easter, and I hope the Knicks win.  That's not what I heard in the hallway.  You're being very nice and polite on the air now, but I heard you were yelling and screaming  in the hallway.  You're probably going to kill me for being in there fixing this commercial.  Lisa, could we do a quick example of sexual harassment? 
[01:20:30]  So, I know if it's, uh, sexual harassment.  Lisa, by the way, just one of the fine salespeople here at, uh, N.E.W.  Just play along.  Who's mad at us?  Okay?  Because our Stacker 2 reads haven't been up to par lately.  You'll just be...  You'll just be Miss Smith.  Miss Smith.  Okay?  Miss Smith.  Miss Smith.  Miss Smith, do you have those files I asked for?  Why, yes, Mr. Jones.  Thank you.  You're doing a fine job.  You look lovely today.  I don't know.  Can you? 
[01:21:00]  You had to jump out of that?  Oh, then I guess that is sexual harassment.  See, that would probably be sexual harassment, right?  And I think you're learning.  That's very good.  Okay.  Gee, I really didn't think we'd have to dump out of that.  I'm going to start out.  Can't start out.  You know what's great about that answer?  We're allowed to do just about anything as long as it's legally acceptable in the studio.  But if you did that same exact thing outside that door ten feet away, you would be accused of sexual harassment. 
[01:21:30]  Did someone on the phone hear that?  Maybe they could tell me if that was sexual harassment.  Let's go to Al and see if Al heard of that.  Al?  Yeah, guys.  Did you hear the unedited version of that?  Oh, yeah.  Was that sexual harassment?  That might qualify.  Yeah, the company I work for, I think I'd get fired for that.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, it was pretty cool, though.  All right, thank you, Al.  Let's see if Ed heard the unedited version.  Ed?  Yes. 
[01:22:00]  Did you hear the unedited version of that?  I did hear the unedited version.  Okay, and was that sexual harassment?  Well, only if she's unwilling.  I think it has to be repeated and unwilling.  Okay.  So that's it.  Listen, that contract they want you to sign?  Yeah.  Why don't you sign it, Jack Me Off or Seymour Buss?  So throw a name like that on the line, all right?  That's a good idea.  That's a great idea.  Hey, whatever works, man.  Have a good weekend.  Thank you, Ed.  Bye.  All right.  Do you have another example for Lisa while she's in the studio, Ed? 
[01:22:30]  Let's see.  Do back rubs qualify for sexual harassment?  That's probably sexual harassment.  I would say that.  Yes.  Touching is a very bad thing.  It's not a good thing, no.  Ms. Smith, are you going to be able to join me for that sales junket that will be going on?  I don't know.  I have to check.  I could really use your help being out of town and all with some of the files that I'll be bringing along.  You could help sort them.  And where would I be sorting them, Mr. Jones? 
[01:23:00]  If I can find it, I will.  See, now, maybe that would also qualify as sexual harassment.  Hey, hey, where are you going?  It's such a fine line.  Oh, she left.  Hey, where are you going?  Uh-oh.  She walked out.  Hey, where are you going?  We're just having fun.  We're going to make s'mores.  Where are you going?  I thought we were all just having fun.  One more?  Boy, it's a fine line.  That was...  Nah, I think that's quite enough. 
[01:23:30]  Since we're doing it for three people in the studio and five on the phone.  Yeah.  Hey, you're sexually harassing me.  You can't do that to someone who's alone.  All right.  Oh, yeah, we did the stacker two read already.  Yes, according to Lisa, we didn't do a good enough job.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, I thought we had another one to do.  Ah, no.  We're talking about time out in New York, Anthony.  Ah.  You need something to do in New York.  You need to find some... 
[01:24:00]  Now, this is a script I could get into.  Oh, my God.  She's going to kick your ass, man.  Time out in New York.  Yes.  You got to find out what's going on in New York.  Hey, that's sexual harassment.  That is.  Get on this.  Harass me yourself.  All right.  We love stacker two.  No.  Okay.  You want to find out what to do in New York?  You can be in town.  You live in town.  You're visiting.  You want to know the best place to catch some music, nice restaurant to eat at, clubs, comedy, film, TV, video, art, sports, theater, everything there is to do in New York.

The Opie and Anthony Show.  Other debauchery on the way.  Stay there.  1027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on this crappy Friday afternoon.  Yeah, lousy weather.  Yeah.  At least you didn't have to commute in this weather. 
[01:26:00]  Well, a lot of people did have to work today.  I know.  Now I'm talking to the people that can hear me and they're saying, what are you, what are you, what are you, I, of course I'm commuting home.  All the people that didn't have to commute are not listening to the radio.  They're home watching TV or something.  I, um, I don't know, I had a little revelation today.  Yeah.  I actually, uh, paid attention to the show up until four o'clock.  The market was, uh, closed today.  A lot of people noticed that, too.  There was no trading going on. 
[01:26:30]  They said, hey, we expect a very good show from Anthony today.  The market is closed.  What is he going to do?  The market's closed.  Concentrate on, uh, the radio show.  Bam.  I'm so glad the market was closed today.  I couldn't take any more pressure.  Yeah.  Went back.  A little tricky.  Went back into it.  Whew.  Made a few investments.  Yeah.  Looking good so far.  Yeah, I know.  Have a little theory on some biotech stocks.  So far, so good, Anthony.  I went a little long on some stocks, Sophie. 
[01:27:00]  What?  I've been pulling back from the really, uh, iffy stuff since I got buried in March.  You went long?  What do you mean?  You're waiting two days to sell your stocks?  Yeah.  No, it's actually owning stocks.  Owning the stocks.  Owning the actual stocks instead of the option to buy them.  That's a bit unusual for you.  Oh, it is.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  At least the end of the month, I don't start freaking out.  It used to be, you know, when I was in high school, it was like,  Oh, I hope she gets her period. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, I hope she gets her period.  Oh, please.  Now it's like, oh, no, my options are going to expire.  Oh, no.  Please go up.  Please meet me.  Oh, I need a price.  You know, I love the way they call it a correction.  Let's see, you've got money.  No, I'm sorry.  That's wrong.  Yeah, we've got to correct this.  You have no money.  No money.  There's your market correction.  You have no more money.  I'm broke?  Correct.  No money.  All right.  And you want to get into a bit of the week?  It's a two-parter. 
[01:28:00]  Bit of the week.  Bit of the week.  Bit of the week.  Where are the spaz drops?  And, yeah, who is bit of the week?  Spaz.  Spaz.  We don't have spaz as we can review because that would be spaz overkill.  Yeah.  Much like anything else, moderation.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, so we have a two-parter.  We're going to play the first part here and then the second part later on in the show.  We want to split it up.  The second part is the whole credit card thing.  Lifestyles of the rich and famous.  Lifestyles of the incredibly stupid.  Yes.  Yes, that's what we did with spaz. 
[01:28:30]  Very, very funny stuff here.  The lifestyles of the act like he's rich and famous.  Right.  Unbelievable story.  The first part of Bit of the Week is spaz trying to get closer to myself and the show, Anthony.  Where are spaz jingles?  We're going to play that in a second.  But before we get into Bit of the Week and spaz radio,  I want to give out some tickets to the New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center,  April 22nd through April 30th.  How many can we give away?  Three pairs right now?  We'll give three pairs out. 
[01:29:00]  One to the 10th caller, one to the 11th caller, and one to the 12th caller at 212-757-1027.  Okay, Anthony?  Yes.  Let's get into spaz radio with our brand new jingle.  It's Anthony's sister on vocals.  Check this out.  It's...  Super shallow, spaz, and nitwit, and he makes me nauseous.  Don't know why we keep him with the troubles that he causes.  Mind the bone with brain damage and thought process of force.  He is super shallow, spaz, and nitwit, and he makes me nauseous.  Dumb little idiot, a dumb little guy.  Dumb little idiot, a dumb little guy. 
[01:29:30]  Don't call him Gavin K.  Dog spaz when he picks up the phone.  Don't expect an answer, of course, his brain cells are all blown.  How'd he get his job without one?  Hey, well, I don't know.  He's the biggest search you ever heard on New York radio.  Hey, super shallow, spaz, and nitwit, and he makes me nauseous.  Don't know why we keep him with the troubles that he causes.  Mind the bone with brain damage and thought process of force.  He is super shallow, spaz, and nitwit, and he makes me nauseous.  Dumb little idiot, a dumb little guy.  Dumb little idiot, a dumb little guy.  Dumb little idiot, a dumb little guy.  Dumb little idiot. 
[01:30:00]  Shut the app up.  Wow.  Shut the app up.  Ouch.  Shut the app up.  Ouch.  It's the One Show.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Yeah, superfly singing along.  I am superfied, man. 
[01:30:30]  What's the agony?  What up, brother man?  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  I just walked into the studio.  Yeah.  What is this one all about?  Hold on, hold on.  I'm just a flaming fag.  Nah.  One of those.  Rick always likes pulling the clips of us saying we're fags.  It sort of justifies him being, I guess.  I don't know. 
[01:31:00]  All right, so I just walked into the studio, and Anthony was laughing his ass off with Ben.  What the hell did I miss?  Well, I'll tell you something.  We didn't have our own spaz here for, what, two days?  Was it two days?  We were spaz-less, and the phone suffered.  And I think everybody was in sort of a weird mood.  Yeah, it's got our own spaz.  It's like when you have to take your beagle to the vet, and he's got to stay over.  You go home, and there's just something missing. 
[01:31:30]  Something missing.  Oh, there's no one crapping on the floor, or eating the furniture, or, you know, you don't  got feed it, and it's a pain in the ass of walking, and the fleas.  But something's missing in that house, isn't it?  You feel a little empty.  Yeah.  An empty feeling comes upon you.  Yeah.  And then we realized it was spaz.  Spaz is the catalyst of this radio show.  Not two seconds after I walk into this studio, me and Ben are just laughing our balls off at  spaz telling us about his couple of days off. 
[01:32:00]  All right, can I back up before you tell that story?  Yeah.  So, everyone knows by now I'm in a lot of pain.  Yes.  I have a really bad back, and I was home last night.  Phone rings, and it's spaz.  He calls you at home?  He just calls me at home.  I don't think he would ever call me at home.  He calls me at home, and I'm like, why are you calling me at home?  He goes, well, I noticed you have a relationship with everyone else on the show, so I figured  I'd call and see what's going on.  That's great.  And I'm just on the couch in pain, you know? 
[01:32:30]  That is fun.  Oh, effing great.  And he goes, I don't want you guys to think I'm really stupid.  But I am.  You know, that spaz we can review, you don't really think I'm stupid, do you?  No.  No, not at all.  No, not until he started talking about his little...  All right, wait, wait, get spaz in here.  This is just classic.  You've got to hear from his own head.  Spaz.  Hey, spaz.  Welcome back to the fold. 
[01:33:00]  Lift up that mic.  Thank you.  Is it true you're now calling me at home because you want to have a relationship with me?  Not in a sexual...  Not in a sexual sense, but you feel like I have relationships with everyone else that  works on the show.  Hey!  And you kind of felt a little left out, so you decided maybe to break the ice, you'd call  me at home, right?  I just thought I'd get a little closer to the show.  And spaz, why didn't you give me a call?  Yeah, right.  I don't have your number.  Everyone knows just to leave you alone.  Just leave me alone. 
[01:33:30]  I'm best just left alone.  Show up for the show, do the show, then leave me alone again.  Like in spaz's head, he debates, hmm, should I call up at home?  But when it comes in, it's like, no, he just knows I just will not call him at home ever.  Yeah.  Spaz, you want a little relationship with the show?  What are you doing this weekend?  What am I doing this weekend?  Any plans Saturday?  I'm working...  Any plans maybe Sunday?  No, not at all.  How would you like to mow my lawn? 
[01:34:00]  Huh?  But spaz, you think I have relationships with everyone else on the show?  And you just feel like we haven't been connected lately, or...?  I just want, like, an outside relationship.  Like, just maybe hang out maybe once.  Maybe once.  Hang out.  No, just so you can get to know me outside of work mode.  You mean, like, hang out, have a few beers?  Yeah.  Maybe talk about the colored?  Play...  I think he's talking more like going to Chuck E. Cheese and going into the ball cage. 
[01:34:30]  No.  I mean, like, he's 23 now.  He's 23.  I think he can handle the ball cage at Chuck E. Cheese.  Now, um...  Spaz.  What would you like to do outside the station?  None of us have lives outside this radio show.  We're boring.  No, just, like, hang out, have a couple of beers, kick back, shoot the breeze.  You know, just talk.  You know, just...  Just talk about things.  What's going on in each other's lives.  Just connect, you know?  God, me and Ovi don't even do that.  We used to do that, but now it's like, uh-huh. 
[01:35:00]  We used to do that.  I don't even live near you anymore.  Well, that's the big problem with that, but, uh...  So we'd go out and we'd drink beers, and I wanted to have lunch last weekend, but you  were busy.  Yeah.  I had that old gag.  I was busy.  Well, I spend most of the week these days in the city, and he wanted me to come all the  way back in the city on a Saturday to have lunch with him.  I'm like...  On a Saturday?  Yeah, it's not going to work.  Well, that's like a day off and everything.  Maybe after, uh... 
[01:35:30]  After the show, start off with a couple of beers at a bar somewhere or something.  Right.  Spaz, give us, like, a scenario.  So you call me up and say, hey, Ope, let's, uh...  Yeah.  Let's go get some beers.  Yeah, let's go hang out.  Uh, wherever you go to get beers, I would come down.  Hey, hello, Ovi.  Yeah.  Uh, Greg.  If I may call you.  Yeah.  Hi, this is Spaz.  Hi, Kevin.  Uh, oh, oh, okay, Kevin.  Kevin, yeah.  Um, listen, uh, I'm not doing anything, um, this weekend. 
[01:36:00]  I'm wondering if you want to meet me in Philly for a Tuesday.  Yeah, I'm going to be here anyway.  So, uh, all right, and then, then what happens?  Like, no, we just talk to see if, uh, you know, you get to know me outside of the show.  You get to know a little bit more about who I am.  Yeah.  Can I mow your lawn?  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Huh?  All right, I guess we could do that.  Can I tape the whole thing for the radio?  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  I just thought it would be better if we knew each other a little bit more.  Well, that's probably worse.  Spaz, you best left on the working relationship.  You don't want to get in my pants, do you?  No.  Let's just get it out on the table.  Let's just get to know me.  I need some hot mango.  Yeah.  That's what girls say, get to know you better.  Guys just, like, hang out.  No, I just want to hang out.  It's not like a big planned thing.  You're just like, hey, what are you doing, man?  Guys just hang out.  They don't, like, you know, say, I want to get to know you better.  You just kind of hang out and then, I don't know. 
[01:37:00]  Get to know how you start off your career.  A little bit, you know, more.  I think we went through that on the air, didn't we?  Yeah, but it's different off the air.  Yeah, it's not as personal, is it?  Yeah.  Forty hours a week isn't enough?  No, but I mean, outside, it should just keep back.  I spend more time with you than the girl I'm living with.  Than Sandy.  Yeah, but I think you should know me outside of the show.  Really?  And I should know you outside of the show.  Is there something to know?  No, but I mean, wouldn't you want to know who you're working with?  Forty, I work in the laboratories. 
[01:37:30]  I'm actually a rocket scientist.  There's something you should know about me.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Matt wants to know if you're gay.  Matt, yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Dude, is he gay?  He sounds like my crying girlfriend. 
[01:38:00]  He's unbelievable.  I want to hang out with you.  I want to hang out with you.  What's wrong with you, Spaz?  The guy's just, like, all of a sudden it just happens.  They hang out.  They don't make plans or anything.  Yeah, man, you finish work and you say, oh, you want to go grab a beer?  And you go grab a beer.  You don't make plans.  It's like, girls make plans.  Girl chicks make plans.  Right.  Chicks make plans in advance and all that.  Guys, it just happens.  You see out at the bar, oh, Opie, I have to go to the bathroom.  You want to come with me?  Look, all right, Spaz, this is how it works, okay? 
[01:38:30]  All right.  I'm staying in the city tonight.  Yes.  We're thinking of maybe just going to get some food after work.  Is that okay?  You want to join us?  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  There you go.  That's what you do.  Okay.  You don't go like, hey, what are you doing Saturday?  You know.  I just like to know what I'm doing.  What are you going to be wearing?  I mean.  I just like to know what I'm doing.  Well, so would we.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:39:00]  Reggie, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  There's an ulterior motive here.  The ulterior motive is he used to be able to say he just worked with you guys and hook up.  Yeah.  He wants personal friends with the Opesta.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, he's a friend of ours.  I know, but he's using you guys.  It's not so much.  The funny thing is, it's, you know, the Opie and Anthony show.  Exactly. 
[01:39:30]  But obviously, Spaz is, I don't know, drawn more to Opie, feeling that he should have this relationship with Opie.  You're like the third wheel now.  I feel withdrawn from you.  And listen.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I've got to let you go, Reggie.  It's getting better in here.  Wait, wait, wait.  One minute.  Whoa!  He's very sentimental.  He should be right in Hallmark, Clay.  Yeah, okay.  Thank you, Reggie.  You feel what toward Anthony?  Withdrawn.  He feels withdrawn towards me.  Why?  I feel like this is blockade, because I remember there was one time Anthony was saying on the 
[01:40:00]  air that the only people he talks to were you, and then sometimes Reggie can talk just about  the show where he talks to no one else.  Yeah.  So I figured that he doesn't want to take any calls from anybody else, so I feel like he's  putting that blockade towards, around him, towards everybody else.  Okay.  Finally, Spaz is right.  And just doesn't talk to anyone, though.  But believe me, I would love to call him, just, you know, just, you know, just, sorry.  It's just that we only know each other, like, in work mode as coworkers.  I like to know each other as friends, too. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, right.  Outside social.  Maybe you could, I don't know, hook me up in one of those hotel rooms you get.  Yeah, we've got to get back into that.  Oh, this is too funny.  So, Spaz, okay, look, we probably are going to get a bite to eat after work.  You can join us.  Okay.  That's how it works.  I'd love to.  You would love to.  I'd love to.  Ooh.  Just don't sit next to me.  Can I see your boyfriend?  Sit, like, on the other side of the table.  But how am I supposed to talk to you? 
[01:41:00]  Why do you want to talk to me?  Oh, my God.  Even when we go out, we go out all the time after the show, and we don't talk.  We just sit there and eat our food and get drunk.  I always end up talking to Earl, but that's no fun.  Get the hit.  You goof on stuff, that's all.  We have, like, a kiddie table when we go out.  It's pretty funny.  We have, like, not saying the main guys, but, like, Rick, Ben, Psycho Mark, me, Ant when  he goes out with us.  And then we have, like, a kiddie table that has, like, Stinky, Black Earl, and Spaz. 
[01:41:30]  The kiddie table.  They're just trying to get into the conversation, just not paying attention.  But they're at the other table, and they try to get involved.  Oh, but it's just not working.  That's a short bus.  I want to break that barrier.  You want to break that barrier?  Have you been going to, like, counseling or something?  No.  I just feel like we should know each other more.  Oh, there's the barrier.  Broke right through it.  Spaz, Ant and I are, like, pretty good friends.  We've been hanging for seven years. 
[01:42:00]  We don't need to get to know each other that well.  Yeah, we know each other.  We know each other.  You just, when you hang out with guys, you just know them.  Yeah, but I feel that I, well, I want to work with you guys for a long time, so I feel  like I should get to know you as best as I can.  I love the revelations that come out.  All right.  So, this is so cool.  Well, let's start with a little dinner tonight, okay?  That'll be great.  Okay.  Now it's going to be awkward.  After the show, it's going to, yeah, it's totally like awkward now.  Now Opie's going to be totally paranoid to be left alone. 
[01:42:30]  What's that?  You know why?  I'll tell you something.  Because it started out hanging out, people going out.  You know what this is turning into?  A frigging date.  It's a date now.  It's turning into a date.  Even though there's, you know, because I don't feel like abusing you, I know there's  nothing gay about this, but now you put me in an awkward situation where I'm going to  feel like, oh, God, now I've got to sit next to him.  Now you've got to talk to him.  We're going to walk in the restaurant, and now I'm going to have to purposely make sure  you sit close to me so I can, like, you know, make me believe I care about what you 
[01:43:00]  have to say.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, how's the mood going?  How's my family?  I don't even know.  How is Sandy doing today?  How is Erica doing today?  We should be asking these questions.  We should be asking these questions.  No one cares.  No one cares.  Be quiet, sir.  All right, so now we've got the awkwardness of after the show, we're going to dinner,  and I'll make sure you sit close enough to where I can ask you a couple awkward questions. 
[01:43:30]  How would you like to move my lawn?  I know you're not going to touch me, but it's not even that.  He's got to tell me I'm not going to touch you.  Oh, man.  No, just so you, like, you get to asking this out.  And for the love of God, come out with us tonight.  Okay, terrific.  It'll give us a whole show tomorrow.  This is great.  This is just some great, great, funny stuff.  I'm not gay.  We're not saying you're gay. 
[01:44:00]  Hey.  You're giving us an opportunity to, you know, abuse you and say you're gay for the next half hour,  but it's even weirder the other way.  Then you care that much.  I care about you guys as friends.  No one cares about me that much.  I care about you guys as friends and as coworkers, but I only know you as coworkers.  I want to know you guys as friends.  Spaz, you know how you make the line between coworker and friend?  And this is an honest way to assess it.  Seriously.  Seriously, if this job ended tomorrow, after, like, a week of calling and talking to each other about, 
[01:44:30]  oh, my God, I can't believe we all got the boot, would we ever hang out again?  Now, you've got to seriously assess this.  Me and Ope, I could honestly see, yes, hanging out, going, we'd have to look for a new job.  Yeah.  So that.  I would hang out with Rick because I'm going out with his sister.  Right.  That's pretty much the only reason there.  Ben, Psycho Mark.  You know, it would be nice to think that we would actually keep in touch, but in time, you know how radio is and stuff. 
[01:45:00]  Once you look, like the people at AAF up in Boston, we don't speak to one of those people.  I'll go back to my gang at BAB.  Yeah.  We were real tight, and I don't see any of them anymore.  So there's a workplace camaraderie that goes on, but as far as the really getting into the personal life,  you know, my friend, let's say, Joe Curry or Adam Ferrara, they don't work here with us,  but we have a very good friendship that goes over the years, no matter what happens at my work.  I'm still friends with them.  See, I don't know if that's going on yet.  I'm not saying it might not, but the way to make dates like this isn't the way to really get it going. 
[01:45:30]  Hey!  You know.  If the show broke up tomorrow, I would see Opie.  Ant?  I would see Ant, and I would see Rick.  Rick wouldn't see Ant much.  Probably not, unless, of course, we all got another gig together.  And I would definitely not see Ben, Psycho Mark, or you again.  Probably not.  Who ever talked to me?  Within a...  Yeah!  It'd be like the phone calls about, oh, my God, you know, how's it going?  You know, got any leads on a job or something like that?  If I saw you in the, you know, in the park, drunk on a park bench, I might say, hey, what's up? 
[01:46:00]  We'd run away.  You know.  I'd talk to you if I'd bumped into you, but the reality is I probably wouldn't hang out with you.  Yeah, it's like a, you know, working relationship where you're very good friends at work.  But that's pretty much...  I mean, nothing against you as a person, but that's just how it goes.  There have been some very good people and very good friends at the workplace that we just don't talk to anyone.  It's just the nature of the beast.  We worked in Boston for three years, and we had some pretty close relationships with people at the station and outside the station. 
[01:46:30]  I hang out with one of them.  That's it.  Yeah.  That would have been a phone call?  Every once in a while.  No.  Call me.  You want me to call you?  Call me.  Yeah, it would have been nice because I keep calling you, and I don't...  I get one or two calls.  Oh, my God, dude.  It sounds like a chick now.  No, no, no.  I call you.  Are you married?  Dude, are you stalking him?  No.  It's just that I'm trying to get to know him.  I'm getting a little jealous of Spock. 
[01:47:00]  Why do I have all the psychopaths after me?  I'm not a psycho.  Why doesn't Anthony have the psychopaths?  I call him if they give me his number.  He's got to do that for me.  He's an incredibly talented individual.  Latch on to him.  Oh, no.  Latch on to me.  I'm not latching on.  It's just that I want to...  I feel like I don't know you.  Oh, my God.  I feel like I don't know you.  These are words that come out of a girl's mouth when she's pissed off about how the relationship's got.  There are people in my family that don't know me.  My girlfriend doesn't know me. 
[01:47:30]  I come home and stare at a TV.  She wants to talk to me.  I swear to God, he has a vagina.  It is so funny.  It's the way a girl talks when the relationship isn't going well.  I don't know you.  I want to get to know him.  Why don't you open up to me?  Why don't you call me back?  Are you working on an unauthorized bio or something?  No.  You're working on a book on the Opie and Anthony show?  No, not about the Opie and Anthony show.  You need some background?  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Stop. 
[01:48:00]  Stop.  Did you hear what you're saying?  You're working on a book?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Does it have something to do with Ant and I?  No, but it's based on characters in my life.  Holy mother of pearls.  Oh, they're in his head.  Spaz, thank God you're back.  Yeah.  We missed you.  We missed you.  Big homo.  You're turning into something that is not.  I am not homo.  I'm not.  Spaz, I'm not even going to work that angle.  No.  There's so many other ones.  I'm going to give you the best of the doubt.  It's just, it's a little weird, though. 
[01:48:30]  I understand that.  Guys just don't get to know other guys, really.  They just have this.  Yeah.  You hang out.  This unspoken thing when you hang out with guys.  You nod.  Oh, wow.  That was a great play on the TV.  Give me another beer.  It's not like guys.  Look at the, you know, the boobs on that girl.  That's guy stuff.  You're thinking of the guys that are like the guys in chick flicks, you know, that hang  out with their friends and discuss things in depth, cry on each other's shoulders.  Do you want to like, you know, start calling me on a nightly basis and start gossiping 
[01:49:00]  about everyone and.  No, I don't want to bother you that way.  I mean, like maybe.  Bother you other way.  No, once a week will be nice.  I can't talk to you once a week.  A weekly phone call.  Or once a week.  Dude, dude, do I call you at home once a week?  Maybe.  Maybe on a Sunday I'll be like, hey, how was your weekend?  Yeah.  You know.  The most I hear from Ann is maybe once every two weeks.  But that's because he withdraws from so many people.  I withdraw myself from people.  Now he's a psychologist. 
[01:49:30]  The reason is I have my friends.  That's it.  I'm done.  I'm done making them.  The reason is because after, you know, spending a week trying to put on a talk show like we  do, you know, the last thing I want to see is you guys.  Talk about it.  Yeah, but you only have seen me for a year and like two or three months.  You've known Anthony for six years, so you've gotten to know Anthony a little bit better  than me.  I want you to know me, too.  I want you to know me.  But, Spaz, I'm going out with Anthony. 
[01:50:00]  I can't.  It's like, doesn't it sound like he's trying to be like my new girlfriend?  Yeah.  I have a girlfriend already, Spaz.  I'm not trying to be anything.  I just want us to be tighter friends.  If it doesn't work out, if it doesn't work out with that, no, I'll consider it.  I mean, what do you want me to say?  He probably sits home.  I can just picture it.  The Opie and Spaz show.  We don't need Anthony.  We don't need him. 
[01:50:30]  If only Opie could see my hidden talent, and Anthony would just disassociate himself  with everybody to the point where Opie gets fed up and he leaves, and then Opie would  say, Spaz, here is this phone call.  Hello, Spaz.  It's Opie.  Anthony left.  And I want you to come on board, and I want to call it the Opie and Spaz.  Wait, no, no.  The Spaz and Opie show.  That's what I want.  He needs me.  No, Spaz, this is it. 
[01:51:00]  When Ant and I go our separate ways, that's it.  I'm done.  All right.  No more radio shows.  Are you here for reference?  Yeah, you can do that.  There you go.  That's why I'm playing the stock market like a crazy man, just in case.  I'm not saying cut Anthony off altogether.  Just saying it's an only two.  So he can continue his friendship with Anthony, but you want to be in his life, too.  This is classic.  We have another stalker working five feet from me.  I'm not stalking you. 
[01:51:30]  It's just that I just want...  Stinky, Stinky just came in the studio.  Stinky, call me.  Spaz, were you stalking this radio show before we hired you?  I actually, I only tuned it in the day before my interview.  Okay, terrific.  Perfect, yeah.  Hey, whoa, hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  There's some great instant feedback coming in.  Mike from Queens.  Heyo, can me and my girl double date with you and Spaz?  Mark from Jersey. 
[01:52:00]  I think Spaz wants to hang with you guys so that you will stop making fun of him.  I think he thinks that if he becomes your friend, you will find it harder to make fun of him.  Maybe that's it.  No.  You only know me as Spaz.  You don't know me as Kevin.  Okay, Spaz.  So we're going to start with a little dinner tonight, right?  Dinner will be great.  Okay.  You guys want your own table?  Someone better bring the DAT recorder tonight.  We're going to get a table and I'm recording my conversation with you. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  I have to.  Sounds going to be awkward.  Oh, Rick, you can't sit there.  Spaz has to sit there.  I know.  I don't want to sit next to you.  I want to sit across so we can play footsie.  Spaz sounds like Carl from Caddyshack.  Go just hang out.  You know.  Cannonball.  Cannonball.  Got that going for you.  All right.  People checking in.  Oh, no.  It's the new sensitive Spaz. 
[01:53:00]  Was I okay on the phone last night when you called?  Yeah, it was okay.  It was okay.  What did you expect?  I told you I was in pain.  I shared.  I told you how much pain I was in with my back, right?  There was one part of the conversation which I didn't, I thought was a little bit, you know,  you know, uh-uh.  Oh, no.  And what part was that?  Like the part when I said that I'm not really that dumb.  And then you said, okay.  And I thought you were just passing it off as a meaningless comment. 
[01:53:30]  But meanwhile, it was not a meaningless comment.  All right.  You did say, you just wanted to tell me that you weren't as dumb as everyone thinks.  Yes.  Okay.  But, you know, I thought you just passed it off.  But it kind of got me, you know, a little, you know, a little upset, maybe thinking a little.  And so I thought I'd approach you with it today.  Is this like another April Fool's joke?  Yeah, right?  It's got to be.  You know, it's tough because I love you so much and you don't love me.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  Opie.  Yeah.  This fax just came in from my friend Joe Curry.  Yes.  Blankfoot.  Yeah.  Ant, let's meet for some wine and cheese.  I think we're drifting apart.  Thank you, Fudd.  But I think Spaz is opening up a whole new realm of sensitivity with friends.  Know how many guys are shaking their heads out there?  When you want to be friends with guys, it just happens.  You don't make plans.  You don't have to get too deep.  You don't call them at home, really.  Unless you say, hey, Opie, Bill's having a cake party Saturday.  You want to go? 
[01:54:30]  Great.  You would never go to a cake party with me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Do you have any other friends besides us?  Yes, I do.  And what's his name?  All right.  Listen.  All right, Spaz.  We'll try to be friends.  Okay.  It'll start tonight at dinner.  That'll be cool.  All right.  We won't put you at the kiddie table.  You'll sit at the big boys' table, all right?  Cool.  Tom from Long Island.  Hey, Opie, bring a rubber. 
[01:55:00]  And then Eric from Jersey is quoting me.  It says, Spaz, it's not you.  It's me.  Cranky Ass from Midtown writes, hey, Opie, will you call me tonight?  I'd ask Ann, but I feel withdrawn from him.  Yeah.  Everybody's withdrawn.  Are you my pal?  Well, we also have to talk to him about why we brought him in in the first place. 
[01:55:30]  Obviously, the conversations go awry when he comes in here.  Yeah.  But he had his birthday.  It was when?  Monday?  Yesterday.  Yesterday was my birthday.  Spaz, now if you're calling me at home on your birthday, why wouldn't you share that  with me?  I slipped my mind.  Are you going to send me a card?  My birthday's coming up.  I've got birthdays coming up soon?  I've been written down.  I just don't have your ages.  Oh, you don't want to know our ages.  What do you want?  You want a card with the age on it?  Like, you know, today you're fine.  I keep track of people's ages. 
[01:56:00]  Why?  I don't think they...  Why?  I like to know how old people are.  Oh, my...  I like to say young because nobody's...  Hallmark doesn't make cards for our ages.  Yeah.  I think they stop at 13.  So, Jay, at 13.  And that's not anything that, like, anyone really asks or needs to know on a card.  You just send a...  If you feel like sending a birthday card, like if we knew it was your birthday, I wouldn't  be like, so you're 23.  Like a little handwritten, hey, 23, you know?  I mean, you just send happy birthday, Kevin, you know? 
[01:56:30]  I say happy, then the age, birthday, and then I do, like, a little thing.  Like my nana.  That's what my nana would do.  What do you mean you do a little thing?  You're 12 today.  Well, next year, you're a teenager.  What do you mean you do a little thing with the age?  I play on the age, and it depends on the age.  I play, like, a little...  Like, I try to make a little joke, try to, like...  Oh, my God.  He's got jokes.  It's a little joke.  I just try to do something, you know, to make the card live.  I think you watch Martha Stewart before you get here, don't you?  No, I don't.  Try to do something with the card. 
[01:57:00]  Maybe a little play on the age.  Yeah, happy birthday, F-face.  Spaz said earlier that he's working on a book.  Spaz's book title, Men Are From Mars and I Am From Venus.  Let me tell you guys something, man.  You know, this radio show doesn't need writers like all the other top radio shows in this town,  because we have our listeners.  You guys come up with better stuff than anybody that we would hire to write this crap. 
[01:57:30]  So now, um...  Yeah, we were going to talk about his birthday and what he did on his birthday.  Let's go and see from Jersey.  Hey-o, try a Let's Be Friends Vermont teddy bear.  Another one from the listeners.  You guys are the best.  Or give a bearcaster a call and get Anthony the withdrawn bear.  Are you my pal?  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Okay, terrific.  Hey!  Woo!  All right, listen. 
[01:58:00]  Coming.  We'll start with tonight.  Someone bring the tape recorder, because I'm recording my conversation with Spaz tonight.  Yeah, you're not going to feel awkward if we have a dad player running.  The tape rolling.  No, but just open...  Talk.  Talk to me!  Open up.  Talk to me!  You never talk to me!  Wait, no.  Oh, no.  Chara.  Chara's in the studio.  Wait, I want a defense, Spaz. 
[01:58:30]  You want a defense, Spaz?  Because he gave me a birthday card last week.  All right, last week was your birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  How old were you, or you don't want to tell anyone?  I'm 23.  23, okay.  So he had something cute to say about 23?  Yeah, he was very nice.  He got me a nice Christmas card also.  He really knows how to write cards.  He's so nice.  Read the card.  You can read it.  All right.  Can't wait for Spaz.  Reading cards.  Happy birthday.  Why'd you write question marks after happy?  Because that means my age.  Wait, keep reading.  Yeah, okay.  I have no clue how young you are, but you look 18. 
[01:59:00]  Well, there you go.  Thank you.  I hope that you get all that you wish for on your birthday.  Because you deserve it.  You are a fellow Aries and a friend.  Ooh, very into the astrology thing.  I hope that we will remain friends for more birthdays to come.  Stay wonderful and happy birthday, Kevin.  Wow, handwritten.  That's nice.  Are you my pals? 
[01:59:30]  Well, no, that's very nice.  Spaz, you're into the signs, right?  Yes, I am.  I'm a Gemini.  Yes, your birthday is in May.  I forgot which day.  I know what day yours is.  May 23rd.  We make a great couple.  I don't believe in astrology, but I am, what they say about Gemini, about being like a  psychopath and split personality and edgy and all that, that's all me.  I'm a true Aries, too.  Great. 
[02:00:00]  All right, listen.  I'm going to try and ram you into, you know.  All right, Ant.  Yeah.  We do have to take a quick break, but.  Yeah, we got to talk about his birthday.  He went out, stayed at a hotel.  He stayed in the city.  You know how sometimes you decide to stay in the city?  And he grabbed a hotel here in the city.  You never guess which one.  All right.  I mean.  It is a good story, because I walked into the studio, like I said, about 40 minutes ago  this started, and these guys were laughing their balls off.  We just went off on a tangent here, but we have to get to the reason why we have Spaz 
[02:00:30]  in the studio.  Yeah.  He spent his birthday in the city.  And spent a bloody fortune.  I guess we could say that.  Right?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have the story next.  Stay there.  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Spaz Radio.  And.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay.  Terrific.  And.  Cut.  Opie.  Antony.  1027.  WNEW.  It's the O&A Show. 
[02:01:00]  212-757-1027.  We announced earlier, Stone Temple Pilots coming to town with the Red Hot Chili Peppers  and Fishbone touring together this summer, playing the PNC Arts Center July 31st, Jones  Beach, August 12th.  Hopefully, we'll have some tickets to give away to our faithful listeners.  Right, Anthony?  Yes.  All right.  As we try to get more bands on our damn talk show here.  If that makes sense.  Well.  People enjoying the bit of the week, Anthony Spaz. 
[02:01:30]  That was only part one.  Part two is even better.  Spaz and his credit card.  You're not going to believe it.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Yes.  If you laughed at the first part, oh, oh, please stick around for part two.  It's hysterical.  The credit card and the expensive room in New York City for his birthday.  Unbelievable stuff.  Yeah.  I believe Robin Leach is a part of the bit.  Oh, of course.  Lifestyles of the incredibly stupid on the way.  As we do the second part of the bit of the week. 
[02:02:00]  But right now, Anthony, we got a little intermission for the bit of the week.  Oh, this girl is so freaking hot, too, man.  She was at our impromptu little road show we did at LeBarbat about a month ago.  Yes.  Remember, from time to time, we'd like to just, like, blow off the last hour of the show,  find a bar in the area, go drink, do some drinking.  We had about a thousand people there.  Yeah.  And one of them was this girl that's coming through the studio,  and she has volunteered to allow us to drip hot wax all over her smoking body. 
[02:02:30]  Hot wax.  Her smoke.  Showed everyone her.  No, no, no.  I think it's Liz was the girl that canceled.  Jill was the girl that showed up.  That's right.  Jill?  Okay.  I remember.  I don't know what her name is, but I remember her face.  Jill.  Bring her in.  They're getting her.  You'll remember Jill.  She showed everyone her ass.  Oh, really?  All the way to LeBarbat, and it was a lovely.  Look at this thing.  Oh, yes.  I remember.  Sure.  Wow.  How you doing?  Great to see you again, Jill.  I was talking to her while we were replaying the spaz thing in. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  And she's very paranoid with his cameras in the studio.  I knew we would wreck it for ourselves.  Well, how are we wrecking anything?  There's no cameras.  I know.  There hasn't been.  But see, we were trying to explain that earlier with the whole Bridget thing.  We do not and have never hid cameras in this studio.  I will assure you of that.  Yeah.  Do you believe us, Jill?  You weren't very convincing when you were...  On the radio, we weren't convincing.  No.  As I said, we never hid a camera in this studio. 
[02:03:30]  Would you like to look over the studio before we get into this?  And there are a lot of places you could probably hide a camera.  You really got to trust Aunt Nye.  It's a crime, so we would never do that.  Yeah.  Never in this studio.  Well, Jill is beautiful.  What nationality are you?  Italian.  Yeah.  She's Italian.  Yeah.  100% it looks like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a very nice body, Anthony.  Yes.  Of course.  We saw most of that body at LeBarbat. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Boy, is that going to get you in trouble?  No.  No.  I wasn't expecting to do that.  I kind of got pushed up on stage.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She was showing her...  Well, you showed everything, matter of fact.  Now that I think it's a surprise.  Well, all right.  We didn't see your patch.  We saw your ass.  Mm-hmm.  Gorgeous ass.  Thank you.  And she wowed the crowd many, many times.  Yes.  Because the guys just kept begging her to go back on stage for another shot.  Another round.  So you're into this hot wax thing? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  All the other ladies once again blew us off.  I hate you ladies.  We got to say this.  If you're going to volunteer to be part of our radio show, we take it very seriously.  I know.  Don't say you're going to show up and then blow us off.  It happens all the time.  Yeah.  Well, it doesn't help anyone.  Thank God we have jail.  Right.  So have you had wax dripped all over your body before?  No, I've never had it.  Really?  No?  I'm a virgin.  You're a wax virgin?  Yeah, we're a virgin.  There's some really hot MTV video. 
[02:05:00]  I don't even know the song.  Don't know the band.  But there was a scene where the guy's just dripping hot wax all over the girl.  And it's not the Ricky Martin video because there was some of that going on in La Vida Loca.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever that stupid song was.  This one was a much hotter scene than we saw yesterday.  There's a whole trick to it, you know.  You don't get too close with the wax.  Right.  Have you had it done?  So it's not hot.  No, I've just seen it in porno.  Have you had it done?  I've had it done, yeah.  Oh, you have one?  Yeah, you've got to make sure you drip the wax from high above. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, that would mean a little higher.  A little too close.  A little too close.  Hold on, I've got to get some sound effects.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, where's Superfly?  I need Superfly.  If you get it close enough, I'm sure I'll make my own.  Okay, here we go.  Here's Superfly getting some wax.  Ouch!  Ouch!  Ouch! 
[02:06:00]  Ouch!  All right, Jill, now where would you like the wax dripped?  Should we start with the stomach, maybe?  And then work our way up, kind of?  Wow, this guy remembers you from La Barbat.  Hold on.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Good.  We were the guys from the cops that were in the back from La Barbat.  We remember we were standing in the back.  You guys were looking at us like, oh, you guys can't do that.  The cops are like, hold my hands over.  Yeah, I love you, guys.  Remember how hot Jill was, the Italian one? 
[02:06:30]  Absolutely.  With the smoking body?  She was smoked.  Yeah.  All right, Brad, thank you.  Bye, brother.  You guys do a great job on the streets there.  Thank you.  We love you guys.  All right, cool.  Katie is pissed off at me.  Katie!  Yeah?  What's wrong?  Well, you guys just said you hated me.  I didn't mean to blow you off.  Well, we're sick of women saying they're coming down here and then they blow us off.  I know.  You were the one with the 36 double Ds, right?  Yeah.  I said, I'm sorry.  I talked to her.  I could explain that I had a situation that I couldn't control. 
[02:07:00]  Do you have a good reason why you're not here today?  Because a lot of times the ladies don't have a good reason.  They just blow us off.  It was a very good reason.  All right.  My sister got sick.  She has six kids and I had to watch them.  Okay.  All right.  I had to call her Easter eggs all day with them.  What is this, a school?  I know.  It's like we're the school.  I would have much rather have been there and I'd still like to come there and do it.  Please excuse Katie from having hot wax dripped on her for her sister is sick and she is needed to care for the children. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Please excuse Katie.  Mother cut off her finger.  All right.  All right, Katie.  We'll forgive you this time, okay?  Will you forgive me?  Yeah.  We don't want you mad, but we'll give you one more chance, okay?  Jack can't come to school today.  Mama shot Papa.  All right, Katie.  Have a good weekend.  What can I come down for next time?  We'll see how this hot wax thing goes.  Okay.  Jill's never had the hot wax. 
[02:08:00]  I think she's in for a little surprise today.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Well, Ann, I think we're ready.  Yeah, I think so.  All right.  Where's the candles?  What?  Ah, there you go.  There's some candles.  Very colorful.  We got a Mike Jill.  You want to get her on the counter?  Oh, yeah.  Candles from the wonderful Yank Me Candle Company.  All right, we're going to start with, whoa.  We're going to start with the stomach, you said?  Sure.  The stomach.  You got to lose the shirt, then. 
[02:08:30]  You got to lose the shirt.  Come on.  How polite.  Rick, be nice.  Rick.  Rick's like a black shirt.  She's grabbing her shirt to take it off, and Rick's like, come on.  Don't wreck this.  God damn.  I don't think we've had a hotter chick in the studio.  Come on.  Don't wreck this.  Take it off.  Take it off.  I just like to say, look at your face.  I explained it.  Are there a tour before I brought her in?  Wow.  You're going to lose the shirt.  Look at that stomach.  Wow.  Very nice.  You take good care of yourself.  Very, very nice. 
[02:09:00]  I just got back to vacations, though.  Did you?  Yeah.  Where were you on vacation?  On vacation?  The gym?  No.  Jesus.  To Texas.  Texas?  Yeah.  What's in Texas?  My backyard.  Steers and queers, Opie.  Is there too many guys in the studio?  We want you to feel comfortable.  Because they could all hide in the other studio, and you wouldn't even know they're looking at you.  They'll just fear out the window.  There you go.  You'll see Scooby-Doo eyes.  Yeah.  A tip to all the ladies that come into the studio and get naked for us.  Yeah.  Just count all the guys in the studio, and then times that by two, because there's another 
[02:09:30]  bunch of guys always in the other studio.  Yeah.  How many guys are in there?  One?  Black Earl's in there.  Black Earl.  Yeah, you can't see him.  Black Earl.  Earl, smile.  There he is.  All right.  Well, let's start with the stomach.  What do you mean?  On the counter and how?  Yeah, you could lay right out there.  Just don't hit any of those vital cough buttons.  Yeah, let's move over to these mics.  All right.  Foot, if you would take my mic. 
[02:10:00]  I'll take yours.  Yeah, lay back.  Jefferson!  There we go.  Wow.  Yeah, that's the interrogation mic.  Look at this.  She's...  Wow.  She's...  Wow.  She's...  I can't really hear myself.  She's lounged out.  What are you doing there, Rick?  All right.  She said no pics.  She agreed without her face.  There are no tapes.  I swear.  There are no tapes.  Where's Liddy?  Maybe he can plant a camera. 
[02:10:30]  She's in a really hot position right now.  Yeah.  We're way above her.  Her stomach is...  Your stomach is perfect.  What size boobs you got there?  I guess 34B.  34B?  34B.  They're nice.  Very nice.  Okay, we're lighting the candles, Anthony.  All right.  Let's get this lit.  Make sure you scream right to the mic.  Oh, she's undoing her pants, Anthony.  Yeah, you don't want any wax to get on those really nice pants.  It's going to be a shame if it's that nice bra got a wax.  Oh, look at these panties that we were about to see. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Don't be shy.  What are those?  Oh, yeah.  Little leopard print.  Those are like Victoria's Secrets, right?  Very good.  I know my panties.  You're going to have to edge toward Opie a little more because I'm not going to be able  to hold the candle high enough with the top of the thingy here.  Here, pull her pants down.  Pull her pants down.  Pull her pants down.  Oh, okay, boys.  You just can't wait, can you?  Well, I don't want to...  You have really nice pants on, and I don't want to get the wax all over your pants.  It'll be okay for now.  Thanks for your concern.  Okay.  All right, Ann, you want to start? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, I'll start.  You're a little closer to the stomach area.  You better get up high, though.  I'll start up high.  I will.  Tell me if it hurts.  What are you aiming for?  Ow!  Fire.  Does that hurt?  That burns a little.  Yeah, it will.  It's hot wax.  Yeah.  All right, let me do a couple.  Where are those lead soldiers?  Let's melt a few of those down.  All right, wait.  Move closer to the edge, though, so I can get the candle high.  You actually have to move up your head toward Opie a little more.  We get paid to do this stuff?  No.  All right.  Just kind of wrap around the counter a little.  All right, I'm aiming right for the belly button. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh!  That had to hurt.  I'll go higher.  How's that?  It's good.  Oh, my God.  Hey, I'm not stopping.  It's like Asian torture.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right, she's stirring.  Wait, there's too much green wax.  I'm the red wax guy.  Hey, get higher.  Higher.  All right, all right.  My God, you're going to cook the pork.  Oh, my God.  We're going to get this stuff off. 
[02:12:30]  Look at her.  She's like squirming.  Wow, that's great.  This rocks.  All right, roll over.  Let's do your ass.  Didn't you say you wrote your name on somebody once in a while?  Yeah, I wrote.  How did we do that with wax?  How did we do that then?  Oh, this girl was dead.  She was a corpse, so she really didn't move that much.  Oh, wait.  Oh, now we've got a pedestal.  I wish the steward would do something like this with candles.  Take out my headphones.  It's a great way to spend the holidays, dripping hot wax on people.  I'm going high.  Are we going for the butt now? 
[02:13:00]  Peel some off.  See what it looks like under that.  Hey, Opie, be careful.  It's going to fall and shove the candle somewhere.  I'm way high.  Ow, by the way, I just dripped some on my finger and it hurts.  From about an inch away.  Ow, ow, ow.  What body part are we going for now?  Uh, the ass.  We've got to lose the pants.  Yeah, lose the pants.  Okay.  I'll lose them.  Can I just like...  Well, you can keep trace of them, but...  Lose them all the way.  Can I just take them down?  No, you can pull them down.  Yeah, that's fine.  And then we'll make you walk...  Yeah!  And then we'll make you walk around.  Hey, she just hit Rick. 
[02:13:30]  Cool.  Rick always wrecks.  I do not.  There you go.  Give me a break.  Like, it's not good enough.  You get to see that?  Wow.  She's got a thong on.  That's pretty nice.  All right, she's turning over.  She's got a perfect, perfect ass.  Look at that ass.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  Can we get a picture of that?  No.  We need a picture of that.  Wow.  Wow.  We are speechless.  All right.  Rick's getting a picture for, of course, the unofficial website. 
[02:14:00]  That could be the best ass we've ever had in the studio, Anthony.  Bravo.  Thank you.  All right, Jill, move over.  Here, mic, Jill.  I don't think there's as many nerve endings in the ass as there are on the...  I don't have a little bit of a hat in here.  I don't have a little bit of a hat in here.  All right.  I just tripped so on Rick's hand.  Oh, yes, Alan.  All right, Jill, turn to the mic, because we want our listeners to hear this.  Yeah, just like that. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  Higher up.  All right, I'm sorry.  A little higher, maybe?  Okay.  Wow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  All the cheek.  Wow, it's squirming around like crazy.  Oh, she's losing it.  Okay.  She's losing it.  How cool is that, man?  Is there a home version of this game?  Jill, how's it feeling?  Did you think it would sting that much?  Are you liking it? 
[02:15:00]  That was there.  That was there.  Anthony just threw a lit match at her.  Wait, I want one more.  I'm going way up high here.  Move your butt to the edge.  Yes.  All right, here we go.  I'm going for the right cheek.  Oh, my God.  It almost tickles.  It almost tickles.  All right.  It hurts, but it tickles.  Oh, my God.  Look at that one.  Isn't that funny?  It looks like some wacky kind of alien creature's ass. 
[02:15:30]  It's got the green and red dots on it.  It kind of looks like a disease.  All right.  Now we're going to come from it.  We're going to eat the universe.  Is that okay?  All right.  Are you taking a picture of the waxed ass?  No, get the other angle, man.  Oh, Anthony, quit here.  Oh, my God.  That was like a whole cup full.  All right.  Very good.  It's not going to really build up in here.  Now, Jill, is it erotic at all or no?  It could be. 
[02:16:00]  It could be?  If Anthony would stop looking at me.  I'm sorry.  What?  Yeah.  And take a lesson from me.  I'm really nice.  What's wrong with my God damn microphone?  Look how nice I am.  This thing ain't working.  It keeps cutting out.  Yeah, see, that's not bad.  That's not bad?  Ow, ow, ow.  Okay, got it.  She's hitting the cough button is what's happening.  Oh, is that it?  Uh, Ant's breaking, Ant's going off the air because she's kicking the cough button.  Oh, she's on it.  She's on it right now.  All right, I think we got enough on the butt area. 
[02:16:30]  You're hitting a button.  There we go.  All right, that's better.  All right.  I was on it without.  Okay, how about boobage?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, boobage.  We'll go from way high up.  We'll go way high.  It'll be completely dry all the time.  Actually, you can get on the floor.  It won't feel anything like this.  Get on the floor.  All right, she's going after Ant.  Come here.  Give me your ass.  No.  Give me your ass.  No.  Ant's not going to show his ass.  No.  Ant's not going to show his ass.  No, do it on my hand. 
[02:17:00]  We'll let you do it on your team.  We'll let you do it on your ass.  Come on, do it on your ass.  No way.  I'm not pulling down my pants.  It's not happening.  Jill, get on the floor.  Jill, because I'm way up high here.  Someone light my candle fast.  Light man, thank you.  Ant, get way up here.  Are we going for the boobs from 20 feet up?  Yeah.  Right there, Jill.  Oh, but keep the candle away from the ceiling.  I know.  Oh, there you go.  I'm under the counter.  All right, Jill is under the counter. 
[02:17:30]  She's got the best lingerie on, doesn't she, Anthony?  Yeah.  All right, put your head up.  Get around from under the counter, man.  Rick.  All right.  Rick, what are you doing?  He wants to slide under the damn counter.  I'm trying to get out.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Everyone calm down.  Oh.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Now she's like belligerent.  And now Jill's on the floor.  Yeah.  We're about 15 feet up in the air.  Are we going to, we're aiming for the boobs, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:18:00]  We'll have people leave the studio if you feel uncomfortable.  I'll take off the back.  Oh, she's going to take off her bro.  Don't hit her face.  Don't hit her face.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Cover her face, because this could be a problem.  Put a paper bag on her head.  No offense, because you do have a very nice face, but get a paper bag for her head.  No, that ain't going to work.  Get a paper bag.  I'm serious.  A paper bag for her head.  She'll be the unknown lesbian.  All right, Jill. 
[02:18:30]  Wow, this is a very nice position you got there.  Yeah, she can do that.  You don't want to get any on that bra, though.  No, that's all right.  No, we need the bra off.  Yeah, we do.  Yeah.  If you cover your face, it'll be fine.  You have nothing to hide.  Trust me.  Okay, can they leave?  Yeah, you guys are out.  Sorry.  Get in the studio.  All right.  You guys are out of here.  Sorry.  Other studio.  All right.  I feel special.  She'll take her bra off for us.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Here comes the bra.  I mean, you did it for everyone at LaBarbeck. 
[02:19:00]  Okay, I know.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Hey, nice.  There we go.  That is some funny ta-tas.  Okay.  Wait, move the bra.  Yeah.  Dude, you sure you don't want to give her, like, a bag or something for her head?  Hold it closed because there might be splatter.  Yes.  Yeah.  Like, hold it under your chin, kind of.  All right.  There you go.  Ready?  I'm way above that.  Here it comes.  I'm way above.  A little higher.  Oh, my God.  That would have hit her right in the face. 
[02:19:30]  All right.  She's squeezing her boobs together because of the pain.  I'm going to try for the nip.  Okay.  I'm going for the nip.  Oh, my God.  Pilot to bomb again.  It hurts.  All right.  All right.  Back off.  All right.  Back off for a second.  Let's see who got closer.  I got closer to the bullseye.  You did?  Yeah, you have the right boob.  I have the left one, and my wax got closer.  I wish I could say what that looks like right now.  That's pretty good.  That is cute.  You've done this before.  It's like a Norton bomb sight.  The Enola game.  All right.  Who's off the tarmac?  All right.  One more.  I'm going to the clown.  One more splatter. 
[02:20:00]  Okay.  One more pass, and we'll be done.  Here we go.  Ready?  From above.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Oh, I almost got it.  Oh, bullseye.  Oh, you got it.  Oh, yeah.  I feel it.  Anthony wins.  Somebody got a bullseye.  She is shaking.  Anthony wins.  Anthony wins.  I think she has a wood floor.  Really?  Yeah, look.  What?  Do you need that wax?  Well, Jill, how did that feel? 
[02:20:30]  Not bad.  Yeah?  Very good.  It's pretty good.  Pretty good.  More asker?  Yeah, turn over.  Rick the asker.  More asker.  Can you get it done with the boobs with the wax all over them?  Okay.  All right, turn over.  You know what?  Let me get one more.  It's like stiff.  Yes.  Yeah, it is.  Yes.  Oh, I thought you were talking about our pants.  No, of course she's talking about the wax all over her chest, Anthony.  Okay.  Looks like she has the measles.  Where's the teeth?  Oh, my God.  It feels really weird.  Yeah, it does feel weird. 
[02:21:00]  All right.  All right.  We're going for the...  We're going for the wax.  Back to the wax.  Ow!  Oh, my God.  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, my God.  All right.  She's grabbing at us.  Okay.  She's in pain.  She's had it.  She's had it now.  She's had it now.  She tapped out.  She tapped out.  One, two, three.  She's out.  May I kind of burn?  You think? 
[02:21:30]  Jill, talk it to the mic.  How does that feel?  Not bad.  It feels okay.  Yeah?  All right.  Peel one off.  Let me see what it looks like underneath.  Peel off a little thing.  Yeah.  That one's in the middle.  Is it red?  No.  No.  No, she's fine.  Oh, you take it like a champ.  Yes, I do.  Those are only third-degree burns.  The hospital's really close to you.  Napalm.  All right.  That was, like, the best thing I've ever heard.  Snake and nape that ass.  Okay. 
[02:22:00]  Where's my bra?  Who's got a bra?  He does.  All right.  I'll be right back there.  Hold on.  I'm coming over.  Ready?  Can someone grab this?  Oh.  Try this candle.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  All right.  And.  Wow.  Rocked.  That was pretty cool.  That was real cool.  Oh. 
[02:22:30]  Psycho Mark's coming in with his own candle that he wants to drip on.  Put that away, Mark.  He's got a little wick anyway.  All right.  Jill's getting her clothes back on.  The phone's just going nuts here, Anthony, as you would expect.  Jack, what's up?  I can't walk.  Jack.  I can't walk.  Hey, what's up?  Wow.  I'm a wax.  Jeff, not Jack.  Oh, sorry, Jeff.  What's up?  You guys are killing me.  You obviously have a girl there with very sensitive, delicate skin.  Now that you have your pot of wax on it, can't you at least soothe her with a tongue  bath or some ice cubes? 
[02:23:00]  Would you like some ice cubes, Jill?  Actually, I might.  Oh.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Rick, run.  Run like the wind, Rick.  Four guys just died.  There you go.  There you go.  A couple of icy cold Budweiser's.  Buds.  We're not drinking them.  They just happen to be in the area, and they're ice cold.  Oh, there you go.  They're icing.  I have a boyfriend, so what is he doing?  Oh, the wife.  Oh, my God.  He's a friend.  He's a friend.  The other guy that walked in all of a sudden now is like, get out. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  They're icing down the area.  Icing down her butt with a couple of cold Buds.  Yes.  Don't you guys owe her to at least be the ones to ice her down?  You did inflict the pain.  I do want to go home tonight, sir.  Don't you have an almost divorcee in that studio with you?  I'm impending litigation, sir.  I can't use this.  This can be used against me.  Put a paper bag on your head.  Thank you, buddy.  Goodbye.  All right.  Let's go to Sean. 
[02:24:00]  Sean, you're next on N.E.W.  Oh, guys.  Oh.  Oh.  I have a request.  No, I don't.  Yeah.  The next time you do something like this, you need a cigarette and a nap break in the middle  of the bit.  Yeah.  Because I was so done so early.  How did this happen?  You got to see what's going on now.  Someone who will remain nameless is taking two very cold Budweisers and...  Massaging her breasts.  Iced it down the whole body with the Budweisers. 
[02:24:30]  And now her tummy.  Yeah.  All right, Sean.  Hey, where'd that other bottle go?  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  It was held someplace else.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, what's going on?  Oh, and hey, man.  The way she was moaning was such a turn on.  Really good.  Trust me.  It was not the wax.  That was hard.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that...  How exciting was that doing that?  It rocked.  We were way high in the sky, too.  New bit, man.  New bit.  A new bit? 
[02:25:00]  As long as they moan and squeal like that, it is a new bit for like a year.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  The best part is she has a natural target with the bullseye and everything for us.  You guys have to find out if she has wood floor or not.  She does.  That's obvious.  Right, Jill?  Am I out of line saying you have a wood floor down there?  No, Opie, you're right.  I hit the target, Opie.  I'll let you go, but I'm so turned on.  All right, cool.  Bye.  All right.  I had a real shaky hand. 
[02:25:30]  That's why I didn't hit the target.  Yeah, I think that was it.  Huh?  I got guns taken.  I know.  She's a workout fiend, too.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Opie had a little problem over the target area.  Yes, I did.  Clouded.  The target was clouded for a while.  Yeah, it was.  I found some breaks in the clouds.  I was able to drop my load.  Of whack.  Of whack.  And it hit the target.  Leave, yes.  I think it was definitely more exciting that you guys did it. 
[02:26:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Cool.  That rocks.  Rick, what are you, licking the bottles now?  Like a fine wine.  Did you get all the wax off?  No.  No.  No, I don't think so.  There has to be.  How many drops would you say?  Funny you were able to say wax off.  There's got to be hundreds of drops of wax all over her body.  Looks like confetti.  Yeah.  She looks like a cartoon.  Terry, what's going on?  Hey, ONA.  I love you guys.  Hey, thank you.  I got to tell you, every day I leave for work, I got to leave with a new bath towel to put 
[02:26:30]  under my seat.  So when I drive home, I got something to...  All right.  All right.  We know where you're going with that.  Thank you.  You guys are awesome, man.  I love you.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks, bud.  Bye.  That was really cool.  So how much did it hurt?  It didn't really...  Do you have a tattoo?  No.  Do you have a tattoo?  Um, no.  It kind of feels like it, a little bit like the beginning part, it stings.  Yeah.  It goes away fast, right?  Yeah.  It goes away really fast.  All right.  Good.  But then once it cools down, it feels really good. 
[02:27:00]  Okay.  Rob, what's up?  Anthony, I got beef with you.  What did I do?  You're the only guy who joined that bit could actually talk about the...  Noah Gay and Mike Tyson.  Oh, man.  You've got to finish this marriage thing.  You've got to get rid of her so you can really say what's on to mine when you're hovering  over the most beautiful girl in the studio.  Uh, I would say Jill is one of the hottest girls we've ever had. 
[02:27:30]  And Anthony talked about the Noah Gay.  Yeah.  Coming on to the Tarnac.  The Noah Gay.  I was dropping bombs.  Why?  Yeah.  I was dropping bombs.  Guys, you guys suck.  I thought it was funny, man.  All right, Rob.  It was like when you're a kid and you play with your army soldiers, you light them on fire  and do the wits-wits.  Yeah.  Yo, I'm telling you, you take me back to when I was 13 years old.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, on a daily basis, we don't get up to 13 years old on this show.  We usually hover around 9 or 10.  All right. 
[02:28:00]  Thank you, Rob.  Classic.  Bye.  Let's go to Rod real fast.  The phone's just going nuts.  Rod, what's up?  Hey, guys, I've got to tell you, Rick cannot move fast enough with that camera to get that  stuff on the website.  Well, let's ask Jill.  What can we put on the website, Jill?  As long as there's no pictures of your face?  Yeah.  Did you hear that squealing?  Man.  That squealing was unbelievable.  Oh.  I am dead.  By the time I get home, I'm supposed to come around the corner, get something at the store  for dinner.  It's been 45 minutes.  I am a dead man. 
[02:28:30]  So the only sauce I'm going to have when I get home is getting on my computer and seeing  these pictures.  Otherwise, I could be miserable.  Did you get any pictures of us as we're dripping the wax and stuff, Rick, or you were just worried  about the body shots?  Yeah, you're going to take pictures of us when you have that.  No, I'm just asking.  Just so people know what was going on, if we had the candles up in the air.  I don't care.  After she leaves, maybe we can just stand there with some candles and snap some pictures.  Unbelievable.  All right, Rod.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Let's go to George real fast.  George, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:29:00]  How are you?  You guys can't be doing this while I'm driving home.  I almost crashed my car in the white snow.  Yes, the way you were screaming, getting the guys really hot here.  I'm going to get it on instant feedback.  You got to do this around 6.30 when I'm already home.  You got to see her body, too.  Very nice.  Oh, you're killing me.  This should be a new Good Friday tradition, right?  Absolutely.  This is very religious.  We're using candles like they do in church, lighting candles.  Lighting the Lamara.  What?  What the hell? 
[02:29:30]  I'm not Jewish.  What is it?  I'm not Jewish either.  Lamara is for Tanaka.  Whatever.  This is awesome.  We passed over her body with candlelight.  I believe I heard her reference God a few times, too.  Yeah, that was good.  There we go.  Now I'll have to go to church.  A very religious show.  All right, George.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Religious programming is what you get here on the Opie and Anthony show.  She goes, oh, God.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, Tom.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Man, I drove all the way home from work.  Got home and had to turn around and go back to work because I just couldn't stop listening 
[02:30:00]  to this, honey.  Will you marry me?  I make a lot of money.  You or me?  No, Spaz wants to marry me, so I'm taking it.  Well, Spaz might actually go for that.  Tom, I look a lot like a killer mosquito.  He might like that.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  We're getting a few feedbacks.  Opie Ryan hoping that Rick isn't like Barney Rubble and puts his thumb in all the pictures.  Remember that?  Adobe Dick, remember?  I've never seen my other pictures yet. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, they'll come out just fine.  And J.K. thanking God that the Van Halen tune didn't come on.  Yeah.  Well, she was squealing.  Yeah.  That was a great squeal.  Do it again.  Squeal?  It's not the same.  I'm not having hot wax dripped on me.  That's all right.  Did you enjoy your hot wax stripping?  Actually, I did.  Can we do that at a live road show?  Yeah, you can.  Oh, there we go. 
[02:31:00]  Book it.  Book it.  Book it.  Virgin.  Leslie's going to tell us how to do it correctly.  Leslie.  Oh, yeah.  We were doing it all wrong.  We were doing it all wrong, Leslie?  Yes, you were doing it all wrong.  Why?  Because you got it.  First, you got to start with baby oil.  And then you have to cover the area with the baby oil.  And then you have to put ice on the area.  Yeah.  And then you drip the wax.  And then it comes all nice and good.  What are you, a dyke? 
[02:31:30]  No, we had it done.  You had it done?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Wow, that's good.  And it's awesome that way.  Yeah.  And clean up is very easy.  Oh, sure.  Sounds like it.  It's really easy.  Thank you, Leslie.  You're welcome.  All right.  She makes it really fun and spontaneous, doesn't she?  Yeah, I know, right?  You have to go to the grocery store or something.  Then you have a truck.  All right.  We're open for business.  How big are the targets, Tommy wants to know?  They were a very nice size.  Yes.  What would you call that?  Targets are?  No, bigger than silver dollar. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You have that nice, like, the nippage.  Yeah.  That fades.  I like the fades.  So, did I do well?  You did.  Excellent.  Bravo.  On board.  I can't wait to see the hidden video.  I mean, just kidding.  Wow.  Greg checking in.  That's funny.  14 years old.  You guys make puberty fun.  Glad we can help. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  We didn't have this when we were growing up.  Hey, they're going to get it somewhere.  We might as well supply the info.  I learned it from you, okay?  All right.  We've got to thank Jill for stopping on by the show.  She'll be at the next road show for us.  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  That rock.  Thank you.  How would you like to mow by law?  Yes.  It's already mowed.  Believe me.  All right, Ant.  Up next, the second part of Bit of the Week.  Trust me.  Stick around.  It's Spaz and his credit card.  It's Lifestyles of the Incredibly Stupid with Robin Leach. 
[02:33:00]  There's a hotel room.  It's just an amazing bit.  It really is.  It's ridiculously funny, and you're going to enjoy it.  So stay right where you are, okay?  Yep.  We'll be back.  All right.  Here he comes.  Anthony is evil, but Opie is worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Cruel and Inhuman show.  1027 WNEW.  Ah, yes, Anthony.  Car cash.  Yeah, this is how you sell your car.  Through car cash. 
[02:33:30]  Not an ad in the paper.  In the paper, what's that going to take you?  Like, at least a month to get rid of your car.  You want the cash.  Quick.  Top dollar.  Paid for your car.  Van pickups.  Four by fours.  Car cash.  Always looking for cars to buy.  Leases.  They'll buy it.  That's right.  I wonder if I could, like, rent a, Perch rent a car for, like, 20 bucks and take it over  there and sell it.  I don't think so.  But, yeah, don't even consider selling in or trading your car until you go to car cash. 
[02:34:00]  Give them a call at 1-800-CAR-CASH.  Listen to this horror story from a girl named Jill.  She took an ad out in the paper to sell her car.  Guys came over, pinned her down and dripped hot wax all over her ass.  She should have called car cash.  Yeah, they've been buying cars for over 20 years, so they know exactly what they're doing.  Like Ann said, they pay top dollar for your ride.  They make it so freaking easy for you with one simple phone call. 
[02:34:30]  So make that phone call if you've got a car that you want to sell.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  1-800-CAR-CASH.  Visit car cash on the web at www.carcash.com.  Or stop by car cash on West 5th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues in Manhattan.  Or give them a call at 1-800-CAR-CASH.  That's 1-800-CAR-CASH.  What?  1027-WNAW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're in the middle of a commercial break here.  We're trying to catch up a little bit because of Jill and the hot wax little bit we just did, Anthony. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  The listeners just freaking out, enjoying the hell out of what they just heard there.  Who the hell do we think we are, playing 12 minutes of commercials?  I know.  I apologize, but we're running really, really late.  That's why we're breaking in here in the middle of it because we want to make sure you guys stick around for a bit of the week,  which is Spaz and his credit card and lifestyles of the incredibly stupid and the very expensive hotel room he stayed in for his birthday.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  It's definitely worth sticking around for, okay? 
[02:35:30]  Mm-hmm.  And we're only about four minutes away from that.  All right?  All right.  All right.  A lot of people commenting about the wax bit, though.  Yeah, people really dug that.  Wax on, whack off is being written down on instant feedback about 100 times by different people.  You know what?  I know that we have mostly the faithful listeners still with us here.  You want to give out the boxing tickets or the car show?  Wow.  Look at that.  If you stuck out through those commercials, huh? 
[02:36:00]  A pair of boxing or we could do a pair of kitty.  Let's do a pair of boxing tickets.  This is huge.  If you're not into boxing, please let someone else win because this is a very hot ticket.  We've got a pair of tickets to see the heavyweight championship of the world.  We've got Lennox Lewis and Michael Grant going at it April 29th at the Garden.  For ticket info, call 212-307-7171.  Ouch.  Or if you're the 10th caller right now at 212-757-1027, you get the tickets.  Okay?  Ouch.  All right, Ant, let me count.  One, two, three, four minutes. 
[02:36:30]  And we're back with Bit of the Week.  It's worth sticking around for.  Stay there.  It's a Kevlar kind of day.  1027-WNEW.  Huh?  Huh?  Oh, we're back.  Shut up.  It happens from time to time.  Wow.  Wow.  Don't worry, we won't make a habit of it like some other people. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  It just happens sometimes.  When you have a hot ticket, you want, you know, hot wax dripped all over your body, what  are you going to do?  Go to commercials or we'll get the job done?  Postpone the, you know, inevitable.  All right.  So we give you that great radio and then we make up for it on the other end.  So shut up.  What do we got now?  We got to get right into Spaz's little birthday. 
[02:37:30]  Hey, you guys all went out to dinner and then Spaz told us about his birthday where he spent  huge amounts of cash on his brand new credit card, just like everybody's done, I guess,  at some point in their life, trucking a massive credit card debt on things he cannot afford.  Only as Spaz can do it and tell it.  All right, Anthony.  Yes.  Here it is.  Believe it or not, bit of the week on WNEW. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  I want to welcome back all our affiliates to the O&A show.  You'll never hear that.  Just practicing.  Yeah.  For nothing.  I want to say hi to our new audience in Dallas.  Dallas, Texas.  Check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hello, Dallas.  Are all our affiliates back on the network?  Just got our ratings from Detroit. 
[02:38:30]  Thank you to everyone in Detroit making us number one.  It sounds ridiculous.  It'll never happen.  Please.  Hey, let's not forget Washington.  Yeah.  No, it's just us in New York.  That's it.  All right, Ann.  Yeah.  Now let's get to the reason why we call Spaz in.  Well, he was talking about his birthday, which was yesterday, I guess. 
[02:39:00]  And he stayed in the city.  What night?  Monday.  Monday night.  He stayed in the city.  Stayed in the big city.  Figured you'd splurge for your birthday, right?  Yes.  You and Eric, I presume?  Yes.  Erica and Spaz stayed in the city.  Mm-hmm.  Stop looking at me, man.  Jesus.  Now I'm paranoid.  All right.  Want me to stop smiling, too?  Spaz, call my family. 
[02:39:30]  They'll let you in on a few things about me.  I have a barrier like Anthony.  That's why him and I get along.  Yep.  We don't like people getting too close.  And we know how far not to go.  Right.  With the barrier.  It's simple.  Hey, how you doing?  Everything okay?  You know, got a problem in life.  Jesus.  Dude, what's up?  Ah, nothing.  Oh, God.  B.S. or this B.S.  And then you move on.  All right?  Well, we don't even get that far talking about things.  Well, maybe some days, Spaz. 
[02:40:00]  Anyway, let's get back to your birthday.  You spent it in the city Monday.  Yes.  With your lovely girlfriend, Erica.  Erica.  Very surprised she's still with you.  After the stuff you've pulled on her.  But that's okay.  She gave you another chance, right?  Yes.  Very good.  All right.  So now, Opie, let's say you're working at a radio station.  It's your entry-level position into the biz.  So it probably doesn't pay all that much.  I made less than Spaz. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  At my first radio job.  This is officially Spaz's first radio job.  Yeah.  Now, well, you've got to take into consideration the cost of living and the things go up.  The pay rate has gone up.  And it was the early 70s.  Yeah, right.  So on an even basis, it's probably comparable to what you were making based in time.  Fair enough.  Sure.  So if you were going to stay in Manhattan, you would probably really shop around for  a hotel because it's very hard to stay in Manhattan for under a couple of hundred bucks 
[02:41:00]  in a room.  It doesn't matter where you stay.  If you could get a rate of $150, oh my God, you're lucky.  And I would be all over Priceline.  Yeah.  And I would panic if it was anything more than $200.  I would panic.  But it's my birthday.  I'm with my new girlfriend because Erica's kind of like a new girl with Spaz.  Seven months.  Seven months.  It's relatively new.  Uh-huh.  I'd splurge and go, okay, I think I could swing about $200.  Two bills.  No more, no less. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  That would get you, what, Howard Johnson's something?  Something's the Holiday Inn over here in Midtown, maybe.  Something nice, you know.  But not Fleabag, but you're not talking the four-star luxury hotel.  Okay.  Anyone want to hazard to guess which hotel Spaz chose to stay at?  Oh, no.  Spaz.  How many stars? 
[02:42:00]  Four-star hotel?  Dude.  Dude.  Hold up another finger.  They go up to five.  Yeah.  A five-star hotel?  Yeah.  What are you, nuts?  What, Ben?  I think after the four seasons, this is rated the top hotel in Manhattan.  Dude, he stayed at the St. Regis.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  Jesus.  Like, would you ever dream of walking in there?  Unless it was a freebie for a promotional thing or something?  All right, Spaz, let me tell you something.  Ben and I, we're doing pretty well these days. 
[02:42:30]  Not great.  Still underpaid.  I wouldn't spend a night there.  I don't have the money for that.  I'm Diamond Spaz Brady.  The St. Regis?  St. Regis.  We stayed at the St. Regis.  Now, this is great.  This is great.  Did you have a doorman and everything?  Did he bring your bag?  I had a butler.  I had a butler.  Oh, my goodness.  I had a butler.  They assigned a personal butler to each room.  Jeeves. 
[02:43:00]  Yes, Jeeves.  A personal butler.  So, Adrian, yeah.  Jeeves.  Jeeves.  Could you get the car?  Give me a ride around the park.  You know how I love the park.  This guy's an author now, all of a sudden.  I think I would like to take a bath.  I'll alert the media.  All right, Spaz, so you figured you were splurging.  Yes.  So, did you have any idea how much this was going to cost? 
[02:43:30]  No.  See, I called to the Pennsylvania and the Peninsula Hotel, but I couldn't get a reservation, so I only knew of the St. Regis.  So, you just called and said, I need it for Monday night.  Didn't ask the cost or anything, right?  I did ask the cost, but I thought that the amount that they gave me was the standard price for a room.  And how much was the amount they gave you on the phone?  They gave me on the phone six and a quarter, but it was more than that.  Oh, my God.  Christ.  Dude, dude, dude.  If you even want to go a little higher end for a hotel, instead of like the Holiday Inn or the Days Inn or something like that, 
[02:44:00]  there's the Novotel, which is like an upper end, the Sheridan, the Parker Meridian.  The Park Central.  Which is right, the Park Central.  These are all hotels based in the $200 frame.  The $200 to $300 frame.  $600 and what?  $25.  $625 for a room with a personal butler.  What did the butler do?  Give me the whole butler's whole little schedule. 
[02:44:30]  He could have gotten a great set of pots for that price.  Yeah, right, Rick?  All right, hold on.  So you...  I'm stammering like Spaz now.  You're so bad!  You're so stupid!  So did you pull up to the St. Regis?  Actually, we walked from Grand Central.  Walking from Grand Central.  You said at the St. Regis, at least get your woman like a cab ride or something.  Get her a limo.  A limo.  With a duffel bag.  It was funny, though, that they were all, like, didn't want to let me in at first because 
[02:45:00]  I was wearing my heavy metal T-shirt with my torn jeans and my legion.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  And I...  Okay.  So...  That was a little wet.  This is great.  All right.  So then you...  You've got to know what the butler did.  The butler...  The butler...  He pressed my clothes.  He pressed your heavy metal concert T-shirt.  He ironed your clothes?  He ironed my clothes. 
[02:45:30]  Really?  Did he iron your underwear and everything?  No.  Just my pants.  He ironed your clothes.  And was it the heavy metal T-shirt or something else?  Yes.  It was the heavy metal T-shirt and the shirt that I wore to Brazano's later that night.  Yes.  Your heavy metal T-shirt is done, sir.  Would you like the creases down the side, sir?  Oh, what?  Sorry.  Sorry.  I seem to have put the crease in the wrong spot.  You know.  You know.  Ho, ho. 
[02:46:00]  Ho, ho.  Now, Spaz, did you indulge in any room service?  Uh, no.  No?  Oh.  Being thrifty.  But I did tackle the alcohol bar.  Oh, the mini bar in the wrong.  The mini bar.  Now, those things, Spaz, are very expensive.  I didn't know that.  What do you mean you didn't know?  Well, I found the bar menu after I partook in the alcohol menu.  Wait, you thought it was like a comp?  Like it was free?  Yes. 
[02:46:30]  For 600 and some odd dollars for a room, you figured the alcohol was free?  And alcohol is to get you over the bill.  And the Rice Krispie bar and the candy bar.  So, how much was your mini bar bill?  Well, they added everything all together for a grand total.  Of what?  Of $743.  And $43 for a night!  Do you realize that's a month's pay?  That's like rent!  That's easily a month's pay for you. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, but I get paid by cash.  Oh, you used your credit card?  I just got a credit card.  Oh, my God!  I just got it like five days ago.  Oh, no!  Is this your first credit card?  My very first.  Oh, my God!  Do you know what this is?  Give me your credit card.  I'm going to do you a favor.  Rip it up right now.  I'm going to cut it in half.  But that's not...  There's a lot more than $743 spent on it right now.  What's your maximum, what's your limit on the card?  $5,500.  $5,500.  How much do you have on it already? 
[02:47:30]  How much do I spend on it?  Yeah, how much is already have you spent on it?  $2,000.  And you got it how long ago?  Five days ago.  Five days!  Dude, you are on the slippery slope of credit card debt.  Your pal Anthony can tell you all about this.  The point in my life, when I had a crappy job, I had three credit cards and about $20,000  in credit card debt.  It took me three years of doing radio up in Boston, making more than I was making in construction, 
[02:48:00]  but it took me three years to pay it off and making a real effort.  I was doing every spare dime I had at the credit card bill, and I was making pretty  good money.  Now, you're making entry-level money.  Yes.  In five days, you have cut your credit limit in half on this card.  You're probably going to go out and do the other half within a week. 
[02:48:30]  No, I'm going to hide it on myself.  It doesn't work.  What else did you buy?  Well, I'm wearing part of it now, the shirt and jeans that I'm wearing now.  I've got a good price at Old Navy.  Ah, good price at Old Navy.  And then what else?  Any other splurges?  Dinner?  Yes, Paisano's.  Ah, Paisano's.  That's free.  We ate free there.  The tip.  You put the tip on the credit card?  You put the tip on the credit card?  All right, Spaz, now I've got to ask you this one too.  Cash advance? 
[02:49:00]  No, no cash.  I haven't got my PIN code for that yet.  Oh, but when you get your PIN number, do you know how much interest is on the cash advance?  No clue.  Do you know how much interest you're paying on this card?  I believe 12.9, but I didn't read the paperwork yet.  It's probably 12.9 for the first three months, and then it goes up to like 19.9.  19, I would say, yeah.  And then cash advance is closer to 25%.  Yep.  So, I mean, your minimum payment could be like 80 bucks.  Out of that 80, 10 of it will go towards paying off your debt. 
[02:49:30]  And 70, they pocket as interest.  Wow.  It's amazing.  And Spaz, it never ends.  Because you know what happens?  When you get done chalking this up, they'll send you more.  And you will use them.  I know you.  I did the same thing.  And you know something?  To this day, after I paid it all up, I do not own a credit card.  I have an American Express card that gets paid off at the end of the month.  And credit cards are so friggin' dangerous, Spaz, especially at your age, at your pay rate. 
[02:50:00]  And you seem like you're getting a little irresponsible here.  Five days, two grand.  How could you pay off?  Oh, my God.  At the St. Regis, 740 bucks in one night.  743 bucks for one night.  How long were you in your room?  Spaz Trump.  Not counting sleeping.  Yeah, I was kind of angry.  I fell asleep at like 11 o'clock.  And then you woke up at this time to check out.  A couple hours tops, because I was in Manhattan just shopping. 
[02:50:30]  So you fell asleep 11 at night.  Yeah.  And you woke up when?  I woke up at about two hours before checkout.  So he spent the night in a bed.  So you checked in for 743 bucks.  Yeah, then left to do shopping.  What time did you check in?  I checked in at 2 o'clock.  Okay, 2 o'clock.  He's getting his money's worth.  But you were out of the room until you came back when?  I was out of the room until 9.  9 at night.  So two hours, he's what?  You're watching TV?  Yes. 
[02:51:00]  Did you rent any of the movies?  No, just watching TV.  Just watching TV.  Two hours later, he's out.  Yes.  Did you bang in the room?  That's not information.  Okay.  I'm just thinking, for that kind of cash and two hours you're in the room,  you better have had a really good time.  It's personal information.  Okay.  All right.  So you banged her.  All right.  So 740 bucks go on your credit card for one night?  Yes.  Was it worth it?  Do you wish you would have stayed at a different place, maybe without the butler? 
[02:51:30]  A butler.  Opie, have you ever stayed in a hotel with a butler?  No, and I don't want to.  No.  That's the funny part.  I have no desire to be that fancy.  Housekeepy.  But the place is great, though.  Yeah?  The setup is wonderful.  It's wonderful.  Yeah, I bet.  Spaz just in from Stone Sea from Jersey.  Tell Spaz to hide his credit card in the same place he puts his brain.  That way he'll never find it.  Spaz, did you lie on your credit card application about how much you actually make? 
[02:52:00]  No, I didn't.  You didn't pad the number just a little to the high side?  I...  To get that $5,500 credit limit?  Well, it's part of an exclusive academic club.  Wait a minute.  What exclusive academic club is this?  It's called Who's Who.  You have a Who's Who credit card.  Yeah, it's for those who have achieved academic accomplishments.  Wait!  You're one of those Who's Who people?  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Wait a minute.  Are you in a Who's Who book?  Yes.  Academic accomplishment?  What did you have to write down that was your academic accomplishment?  No, but I...  No, it's...  They submitted my name to be in the Who's Who club.  Iona College submitted my name.  How much did it cost you?  I don't remember.  To get in.  I really don't remember, but I'm a part of this and I'm in their yearbook.  So they send you a credit card based on your Who's Who status? 
[02:53:00]  Yes.  With a $5,500 credit limit?  Yes.  Of which you've burned $2,000 already?  Yes.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, lifestyles of the incredibly stupid.  Today, we delve into the life of spas.  You may have heard this term before, but it really applies to spas.  Spas.  The spas.  Nigga rich. 
[02:53:30]  Spas.  Making in the tens of dollars working at N.E.W.  Spending it like a drunken sailor.  Spas.  Look at his room here at the St. Regis.  Him and his lovely girl, Erica, have a personal butler to iron his heavy metal t-shirt.  Here he is whisking his lovely lady away on a train at Grand Central Station. 
[02:54:00]  Where they will walk 50 blocks to the beautiful St. Regis Hotel.  Costing more money than he sees in a year.  All chalked up on his Who's Who credit card.  As we speak, Spas is over his limit.  After a fancy dinner at Paisano's, which Spas gets for absolutely free, he generously tips 
[02:54:30]  the waiter on his new credit card.  What a pain in the ass for the waiter, who now has to claim it on his taxes.  Spas, you dumb prick.  Lifestyles of the incredibly stupid.  Here he is wearing the St. Regis robe, which he took home and they had charged him an additional $500. 
[02:55:00]  Did you wear the robes fast?  No.  And the slippers?  I wore the slippers.  They were very comfortable.  Spas tacked another $85 on his bill.  Let's delve into the mini bar.  Living like Spas on a diet of Rice Krispie treats and Chivas.  Dining like the stars. 
[02:55:30]  Spas, how did that $25 Snickers bar take?  Spas, come to think of it, I want to be your friend now.  Spas is buying dinner tonight.  Spas is buying dinner tonight.  This just in from Juan from Queens Village.  Hey Spas, the butler wants you to call him because he felt withdrawn from you.  Hey Opie, with all the money Spas has, maybe he could buy a nice strapless dress to wear for your date tonight. 
[02:56:00]  Champagne wishes and ravioli dreams.  Raviolios.  Spas for one evening out on the town at the St. Regis.  Able to get away from his normal diet of weenies and beans.  For room service at the St. Regis.  Here he is being greeted by the doorman that won't even let him in until he gives a reservation number. 
[02:56:30]  What a tool!  Here he is Spas Rockwell.  Who wants to stay at the St. Regis with a guy that's acting like a millionaire?  Spas has about $3,000 left. 
[02:57:00]  Maybe what, $3,500?  We have another three days of Spas acting like Donald Trump.  Here's Spas writing out his check for 25% interest.  Spas Fernando on Line 9 says you could have went to Cancun for a week on that money.  Yeah.  If you're going to spend the money, you might as well, like... 
[02:57:30]  If I could treat myself.  Here comes the Repo Man to Spas' pad to repossess his brand new Old Navy clothes.  Spas, you could star in the remake of The Jerk with Steve Martin.  Wow.  He could, right?  You are going to go through that credit card so fast.  Hiding it won't count matter either.  Why?  Because you hide it and then you just go...  I just use it for this one thing.  And then before you know it, no more credit limit. 
[02:58:00]  You're left with the bills.  Nothing to show for it.  What else?  Somebody wants to know, they did the math, the $1,300 that you have spent on this thing other than your St. Regis stay.  Yes.  What did you spend it on?  It couldn't be $1,300 in dinner at Paisano's and clothes.  No.  There's another big charge on there, isn't there?  No.  Did you buy some form of electronics?  Yes.  What did you buy, Spas?  Okay.  I purchased stuff to upgrade my computer system. 
[02:58:30]  Okay.  I bought computer games.  I bought PlayStation games.  I bought a $200 pair of boots.  $200!  $200 boots!  Wonderful!  Here's Spas lounging in his Spas pad and his $200 boots, playing his brand new PlayStation games.  Oh, look at that.  Bill's just pouring in, but Spas doesn't care. 
[02:59:00]  He works at N.E.W.  Look at the lovely bean bag chair he's purchased for his lovely apartment.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So, you bought some stuff.  What did you...  Spas is also getting a new apartment, you know.  Yeah, I know.  Where are you looking?  Central Park West?  No.  A luxurious townhouse!  I figured I could stay there for three hours.  The rent I haven't figured out, I could stay there for three hours. 
[02:59:30]  It's great.  Overlooking the park.  It's beautiful.  Oh, I'm evicted already in the time it took me to say that.  Oh, my God.  You spent all that money revamping your computer.  And how much did all that equipment cost you?  That equipment cost me about $500.  Yeah.  Okay.  Five beans there.  Yeah, $200 for the boots.  And then two for the boots.  Yeah, some new clothes.  Some new clothes.  Didn't you buy anything for Erica?  Yes, I did.  I bought her a nice outfit and some other things she needed. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  All right.  In Spaz's defense, because a bunch of people are calling and they're saying, hey, man,  everyone has done this when they first get that credit card.  Yeah, we have.  Of course.  I mean, that's why.  I totally went.  I never had the balls to spend $743 one night in a hotel when I first got my credit card.  Dude, I was dumber.  Get this.  Me working on my Tin Knocker salary.  They sent me a credit card with an $8,000 credit loan.  Oh.  $8,000. 
[03:00:30]  I'm rich.  Now, did I piss it away?  No.  But did I do something incredibly stupid?  Yes.  What did Anthony buy?  What did you do?  I bought a C.J. Jet ski.  Oh, that's right.  On a credit card.  I remember the jet ski.  I laid out that thing.  Wham.  But I had three of the best summers of my life.  And I was able to sell it after I was done.  Kept it in good condition.  Paid interest up the ass for it.  But, you know, I was able to sell it for something.  Not like, you know, if you piss it away.  Oh, my God.  On dinners and things like that, which I also have done. 
[03:01:00]  Don't get me wrong.  I mean, I was incredibly stupid.  Tips to the waiters at Paisano instead of cash.  Dude, I got to ask you.  Did you tip the butler?  Yes, I did.  Not only credit cards.  I gave him cash.  I slipped him a one.  I gave him a dead president, Mr. George Washington.  No, I said, like, come here, let me take care of you.  Let me take care of you.  And how much did you give him?  I greased his palm.  Well, I gave him ten dollars. 
[03:01:30]  Ten bucks.  Ten bucks to iron your heavy metal piece, sir.  Thank you, Stan.  All right, listen.  People are calling up with their credit card horror stories.  We do have to take a break here.  Anything else you want to get out here?  Oh, my God.  This just in.  Opie, your girlfriend, Sandy, checking in.  She just ordered a cruise on Spazz's credit card.  But don't worry, Spazz. 
[03:02:00]  Opie will pay you.  Very good.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Spazz, well, happy birthday.  Happy effing birthday.  Thank you.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Woo!  Is he a catalyst for this damn show or what?  There is no other human being like him.  I cannot believe how screwed you are credit-wise.  This is going to eff you up so bad.  Oh, my God.  Dude, rip. 
[03:02:30]  Give me the card.  He's not going to.  No.  I know what that's like.  It's like, go up into the hundreds there in the streets  and ask the guy for the crack pipe.  Go ahead.  Give me your crack pipe.  It's the same thing.  He's felt it.  He knows what it's like now.  He knows pulling out that plastic.  Ooh, that's pretty cool, isn't it?  You're getting all this stuff and it's like, it ain't even money.  This is great.  I just got to sign my name.  It's free.  This is free stuff.  It's great.  Spazz has been a card member since April 2000. 
[03:03:00]  It'll be in the new commercial.  Member since April 2000.  April 2000.  Spazz, are you thinking about any trips or anything?  Yes.  Wow, those are dangerous, too.  You can just go right up to the desk at American Airlines or something.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  They sweep that card through.  All of a sudden, you're winging your way to Cali.  Unbelievable.  Traveling around the world with Spazz and his credit card.  Here's Spazz in Monaco. 
[03:03:30]  Leaving the airport on foot with his new $200 boots to walk to the hotel 15 miles away.  But he'll be staying at the wonderful Monaco Sheridan for $740 a night.  Now here's Spazz in Paris, France.  Here he is walking from the airport to the hotel. 
[03:04:00]  Thank God he took the Concorde there and saved some time.  Tickets on the Concorde, $3,000 each.  But who cares?  I just signed my name.  Shopping at the Old Navy in Bangkok.  It's Spazz around the world.  Here's Spazz in Japan.  Wonderful.  Buying a brand new Sony PlayStation 2 in Japan.  And then hopping on a plane and going home to play. 
[03:04:30]  All right, Spazz.  Say good day to Spazz in Australia.  Here he is wrestling an alligator who got a hold of his credit card.  And frolicking on the beaches of Hawaii.  In his heavy metal t-shirt.  Here's the butler ironing his heavy metal t-shirt.  In Hawaii. 
[03:05:00]  Spazz in his credit card winging about the globe.  Spazz on safari in Africa.  Spazz comments, look at all the colored here.  He might be a big spender, but he's still a racist.  He can be quoted in the hotel in Africa saying,  I think that coon stole my number.  Oh, boy. 
[03:05:30]  Bell boy, bell boy, grab my bag.  There's Spazz tipping the bell boy a quarter.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Two extra bucks.  As in Piccadilly seconds.  And there he is at his hotel raiding the minibar. 
[03:06:00]  That's great.  All right.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  We got to take a break.  Okay.  Yeah, we are really late.  We're real late.  All right, we'll be back.  It's...  He's a stupid child, a thousand nitwit.  And he makes me nauseous.  Don't know why we keep him with the trouble that he causes.  Mind the bone with brain damage.  And thought about his own party.  He's a stupid child, a thousand nitwit. 
[03:06:30]  And he makes me nauseous.  Dumb little lady and a dumb little guy.  They call him Captain K dog spaz when he picks up the phone.  Don't expect an answer cause his brain cells are all blown.  How'd he get his job with ONA?  Well, I don't know.  The best answer you ever heard on New York radio.  He's a stupid child, a thousand nitwit.  And he makes me nauseous.  Don't know why we keep him with the trouble that he causes.  Man's a bone with brain damage.  And thought about his own party.  He's a stupid child, a thousand nitwit.  And he makes me nauseous.  Dumb little lady and a dumb little guy.
