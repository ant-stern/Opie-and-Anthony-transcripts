<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie and "little Jimmy" (filling in for Anthony) engaging in their characteristically vulgar banter.  They then discussed Louisville's NCAA basketball victory, focusing on Kevin Ware's participation in the net-cutting ceremony despite his broken leg and Rick Pitino's coaching.  Opie recounted a crude anecdote about a father-son outing in New York City involving scantily-clad women and a confrontation with a park official.  The hosts then launched into a detailed description of annoying gym-goers, including a "meat gazer," a suit-obsessed man, and an obese man who hoarded chairs near the bathroom.  The aggressive behavior of Times Square costumed characters was discussed, referencing recent arrests for pushing a child and making anti-Semitic remarks.  The death of Annette Funicello was mentioned, with the hosts displaying a video showing the effects of her MS.  Opie complained about expensive WrestleMania parking.

A substantial portion of the show focused on celebrity stalking, particularly Alec Baldwin's case, with Opie expressing extreme anger and advocating for harsh punishments, including lethal consequences.  The discussion broadened to encompass mental illness, focusing on the lack of accountability and the challenges faced by families of sufferers, with a caller sharing their experience with a schizophrenic family member.  Comedian Tom Papa joined the show.  The conversation shifted to women's revealing clothing after cold weather, cultural differences in modesty, and instances of violence against women in certain cultures.  Papa shared a story about Whitney Cummings and covering up in a Beirut mosque.  They discussed two "creepy" gym regulars: an older man who only interacted with a Black employee naked and another who feigned busyness on his phone, as well as a litterer. The conversation also touched upon Paul Anka's upcoming appearance, playing clips of his songs and discussing his career and connection to Frank Sinatra.  A significant portion was dedicated to a critical, often vulgar, dissection of Brad Paisley's "Accidental Racist," featuring LL Cool J.  The hosts mocked the lyrics and questioned LL Cool J's authenticity.  A caller introduced "hick hop," and the hosts discussed the confusion on Twitter surrounding Margaret Thatcher's death.  A child's suspension for a mohawk was debated, leading to a wider conversation about school rules and parental involvement. The show ended the segment previewing Anka and noting the popularity of wrestler Fandango.

The next segment began with a discussion about the show's reach, the limitations of SiriusXM's focus on car radio, and the rise of podcasts.  This was followed by a humorous segment involving Tom Peppy, and the unexpected arrival of Paul Anka.  A lengthy interview with Anka ensued, covering his career, anecdotes about Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr., the creation of "My Way," Sinatra's regrets, his songwriting process, collaborations, and personal life.  He promoted his book and new album.  The show concluded with a brief segment featuring Brendan Burns, who discussed quitting a TV job with Kelly Osbourne, his Perrier Award, and his Wrestlemania experiences.  He mentioned his appearances on Monday Night Raw with his 13-year-old son, Luke.  Jordan Hembrough, host of "Toy Hunter," joined along with DJ Who Kid. They discussed Hembrough's show, the value of collectible toys, and anecdotes about dealing with clients.  Burns recounted his experiences incorporating wrestling into his stand-up and heckling a wrestler at Wrestlemania.  The segment ended with the guests promoting their work and the hosts promoting Dollar Shave Club.  Frequent vulgar language and off-color jokes characterized the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio, Antonio, and now a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  Why didn't we live with him?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls. 
[00:00:30]  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's dang over here, don't listen to me, dang over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm with him, Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning. 
[00:01:00]  Morning.  Morning.  God, I can't believe Louisville beat Michigan last night.  I went to bed.  I can't stay up for these games anymore, especially keeping the hours we do.  And Michigan was kicking their ass when I went to bed.  So I was like, oh, that's kind of a shame, because I kind of like Rick Pitino, and then  you got the Kevin Ware story.  And I'm like, oh, that sucks that it didn't work out in the end. 
[00:01:30]  And then I wake up this morning and got a little treat that Louisville outlasted Michigan.  Holy fuck.  Louisville national champions.  And Kevin Ware got to cut down that net yesterday with a broken leg.  It would be funny if they didn't give him a ring.  He didn't complete his semester.  They let him cut down the thing?  He was the last one, you know.  They take turns, so they lowered the net.  It was a pretty good moment.  I just saw it just before the show.  They lowered the net, and there's Kevin Ware cutting down the last bit of the net for Louisville. 
[00:02:00]  And Rick Pitino, first coach, I believe, to win with two different college teams.  That's never been done before?  I thought it was done before.  I would have thought it was done before.  But then again, these college coaches usually spend their entire careers at one school for  the most part.  So there you go.  Congratulations to Louisville and all the college basketball fans.  It is spring in New York.  I got to say, I went out yesterday with my son, and I've seen women. 
[00:02:30]  With a lot less clothes on, turns you into a caveman.  Holy fuck.  You immediately walk up to him and go, you should put some more clothes on.  Holy fuck.  You don't realize, man, how horned up you could get after a long winter.  And winter held on for a long time here.  And the women, though, especially in New York, like girls are just ready to rip all their  clothes off.  And they did yesterday.  They were running around and stuff. 
[00:03:00]  I couldn't believe it.  But, I mean, it went from long, heavy coats to barely anything on as they were, you know,  getting a little exercise in yesterday.  And today it's going to be like 80, so everybody's going to have tiny little shorts on all day.  It's very exciting.  I hope not.  And my young son's like, Daddy, Daddy, watch this, watch this.  I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  As they're just running by me.  I was down near the river.  Oh, you went down?  And then one of the park officials told me maybe I shouldn't be playing in the river, that  the water might be a little bad.  You were playing in the river? 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  I mean, we were throwing rocks and stuff, and he was getting his feet wet a little bit.  Yeah.  What?  How bad could that be?  The Hudson River?  Yeah, isn't the water's moving constantly.  It should be all right.  There's blood with AIDS in it.  I know.  The guy had to, like, we were just having, like, a father-son moment.  No one was bothering us.  We're by ourselves.  And I was doing the right thing.  I made sure we weren't actually in the water.  But, of course, he had to stop and just fucking be a nudge.  Like, I don't know what's up. 
[00:04:00]  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I wouldn't do that if I was you.  What?  Throw rocks in the water with my kid?  Leave me alone.  On what planet do you think that's a good idea?  Yeah, exactly.  He's another one of those guys.  Of course.  You can't find a spot in New York City to just be alone.  There always has to be someone that's right there to say or do something.  Well, everybody needs a little bit of authority, you know?  It makes them feel important.  It's like the traffic cops, you know?  This fat fuck.  I want to say, why don't you worry about your own fucking eating habits before you worry about what I'm doing? 
[00:04:30]  He's a big fat guy?  Yeah, big, huge slob of a guy.  I don't even know how they got such a big uniform for this idiot.  He was heavyset.  Let's say heavyset.  No, he was a slob.  Heavyset.  I like that better.  You just stand outside Dunkin' Donuts and go, excuse me, excuse me.  I don't think it's a good idea that you go in there.  Exactly.  Thank you.  It's too bad for your health.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He had a huge uniform on.  I'm like, really?  You're worried about what I'm doing?  You should be worried about what you're doing. 
[00:05:00]  Isn't it crazy when you see that much fabric on a person?  It's kind of...  Oh, my God.  What the fuck did you do?  I went to push Anthony's...  I had to push the monitor down.  Anthony's monitor.  Anthony's not here today.  He's sick.  Will sometimes bump my thing.  Yeah.  So I pushed Anthony's monitor down so I could move my mic over.  And it disappeared.  Dude, it's sinkhole.  It's a fucking sinkhole.  I think we got a sinkhole in the studio.  I don't think that was supposed to happen.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Are they going to fix that for you, or are you going to just have to maneuver?  I don't mind. 
[00:05:30]  They offered to move it.  It's not...  With anseer, it's just going to move it.  You don't mind, because you're just a nice guy.  You should mind.  I have to knock it into his thing.  You should mind.  So...  But yesterday was ridiculously nice outside.  Yeah.  And, you know, the front of my pants were getting a little tight.  You're getting erections outside?  A little tight.  It's creepy.  I don't know.  That's not a problem.  I didn't say erections.  They were getting...  It was just getting a little tight.  You're getting a little...  You felt a little blood rush down there?  Man, the first few days of spring, when they take all their clothes off,  it's just so ridiculous. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  It does get very exciting.  It makes you feel like you're in high school again.  It's weird.  It's just good to be a man, I guess.  Yeah.  Fuck!  Did you get all fucking horned up yesterday walking around?  I know.  I told you.  I go tell them to put more clothes back on.  That's obscene.  I don't go for that.  You like the winter.  You bet I do.  Nice bundled up gal.  Everybody's bundled up like little penguins.  I love it.  I have enough hard times in the gym.  Fuck it.  Oh, there's another one in the gym.  She's not nearly as hot as the other one.  Right.  She's probably in her late, early 40s. 
[00:06:30]  Mm-hmm.  But she has a little bubble ass.  Mm-hmm.  And the camel toe...  Ridiculous.  ...is fucking out of control.  So there you go.  It's out of control.  So yeah, but that means it's in the gym.  She dresses the same all the time.  There you go.  But I was out of my mind yesterday looking at her.  Me and Jimmy went to the gym yesterday after the show, and we both were very sad that the  two creeps that are always in the locker room weren't there.  I saw them, but I saw one of them.  You like seeing them there now.  We were sad.  We got all excited.  We walked into the locker room, and the first location, he wasn't there. 
[00:07:00]  And then the second location, he wasn't there.  We were all bummed out.  But then I saw the one guy.  Of course he was there.  Oh, the fucking meat gazer?  Yeah.  Fucking Alan Arkin?  Yeah, the meat gazer that's constantly on his phone, you know, making believe he's got  shit to do.  He was there a little later.  He was there.  He woke up the fucking treadmill.  It's one of those elevated treadmills that points up at an almost 90 degree angle, and  he holds on to it and just fucking swishes up it.  I want to fucking smash him. 
[00:07:30]  He was there.  Of course he was there.  That's the worst.  How do you get away with going to the gym six hours a day just so you can do some meat  gazing?  I know.  He just sits there pretending to be on his phone for hours?  Yeah.  That's why I hate him.  Yeah, and I've gone, you know, because of my schedule, I never know when I could go  to the gym, so I go, I don't have a set schedule, really.  I go, you know, all over the place.  And no matter what time I go, the guy's there.  So he's camping out in the locker room to gaze on some meat. 
[00:08:00]  And he just sits in the locker room the whole time?  No, he kind of, he works out a little bit, then he sits down, and then he conveniently  sits down where there's, like, rows of lockers in front of him.  There should be rules about how long you can spend in that locker room for the gazers.  I don't even, I don't even care.  Yeah, I just, I don't even care.  I just find it silly.  That he just sits there and gets it.  Just how silly it is.  I don't like them fucking, uh, like, there's some guys, there's one guy I see all, let's  say 70% of the time I'm there, and he's lockers, and he's a fucking in-shape, nice 
[00:08:30]  guy.  We have, we have, like, little chit-chat.  Hey, I see you got another shelf in your locker.  Is he, is he the guy that obsesses about keeping his clothes clean?  Because we haven't talked about that guy either.  Holy fuck, there's a guy, he's like, uh, American Psycho.  Not, not, he doesn't, he doesn't have that look in his eyes, but he has that same thing  where he, he's constantly, uh, taking care of his look.  Does he have facial hair?  Uh, no, I don't think.  Does he have a little tattoo on the small of his back somewhere? 
[00:09:00]  I don't know.  Like a tramp stamp?  No, no, no, there's one guy who has a tattoo on his back, but he's always in the mirror,  so you see it when you walk by.  No, there's one guy that is constantly, and he, and there's some kind of steamer thing  for suits, I guess.  Oh, I don't know.  Something I've never used in my life.  He steams his clothes, and he takes forever to get out of the gym.  I mean, I, I don't think he's a meat gazer or anything.  Wow.  But I think he's one of these guys that is OCD and has to look completely perfect.  You haven't noticed him yet?  If he's the guy I'm thinking of.  Yeah, he's, uh, he's younger. 
[00:09:30]  He's younger than us.  His locker's not, if he's the one I'm thinking of.  His locker's near you.  I'm not sure if it's in the same row or not, but he's right in that area, and he has his  suit all, you know, hung up, and he steams it slowly, and then he goes in the bathroom  and does all sorts of shit.  See, I don't know if this guy wears a suit.  It takes him forever to get out of there.  This guy's in his early 30s, but he has a beard now.  He's just got, like, a little bit of facial hair.  He's a really pleasant guy, but he has a tattoo on his back.  Again, he's one guy.  I see him in the mirror every time.  He has a towel on.  He's not being perverted, but he's always doing something to himself. 
[00:10:00]  Grooming?  Yeah.  I'm fascinated by people.  I mean, it's just weird to see, like, different people in a locker room like that.  Then there's the obese black guy who weighs about 500 pounds.  I don't know if you've seen him.  He sits on those two chairs before you walk into the bathroom.  But he's not meat-gazing.  He's just on his phone.  He feels like he's doing something because he's at a gym.  Right.  But at least he shows up.  I think everybody talks about you guys, and then there's those two assholes that just 
[00:10:30]  sit there making judgments about all of us all the time.  Yeah, and there's the one guy with the hood.  Like, I always wear my hoodie because I sweat more that way.  But he probably thinks, ah, he doesn't want to know if he thinks he's famous, but that's  really not why I do it.  But you are famous.  You are famous, Jimmy.  No one would even look twice at me in that gym.  You're famous.  I was almost famous.  I'm handsome.  I was almost famous.  That's worse than fucking not being famous.  What do you mean you were almost famous?  I almost made it.  You made it.  I mean, you're...  Nah, this isn't real fame.  This is, like, silly fame.  You don't think you were famous before, even at your peak? 
[00:11:00]  I was almost famous, yeah.  You were on the cusp.  Yeah, we were.  It's all right, though.  It's fine.  I'll take silly fame.  It's fine.  Yeah.  You get to be you.  You don't have to be phony famous.  That's fine.  You had a guy that was just staring at chicks yesterday.  Yeah.  And today's going to be 80.  I don't even know how I fucking leave this building today.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  You should have walked around yesterday.  I will look straight ahead.  I don't go for that at all.  You know me.  I'm telling you, because it was the first day, and they just said, fuck, you know, what's 
[00:11:30]  the minimum amount of clothes I could wear today?  Or it's in your head.  I don't know.  Is it like that in the middle of summer, and you just don't realize, because then you start  getting used to that look?  I mean, it is like that in the middle of the summer.  I think it's just such an abrupt transition.  I think that's what it is.  There's no, like, it just goes from winter to summer clothes.  Even though it's not warm enough for summer clothes yet, everybody just gets so excited  that the winter's done.  They just rip all their clothes off.  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  They just walk around in underpants.  Yeah.  Yeah, basically.  Pretty much.  No, no underpants, because then I saw a girl with jeans, and I could just see it going  like this.  Oh.  Yeah.  Make sure the private part was going like this.  Oh, my gosh.  I love that when you can see the camel toe moving in sections.  That's what it was doing.  Yeah.  My dick itches, man.  It's not because I shave.  You don't want to, you never want to say your dick is itching.  No, but it's not, I shaved yesterday in the, uh.  You shaved clean? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I always do a clean shave, but I think at the.  Everything?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Totally nothing left.  I get like a razor bump once in a while, but I have a pretty good time shaving.  It's usually not bad.  But I think yesterday I wound up, uh.  That means you were excited, and you didn't take your time.  No, I might have, I met the razor.  What were you prepping for?  I just do it in the shower at the gym, and I might need a new razor.  In the gym?  Those razors are blue.  No, no, I have my own razor.  Oh.  That's weird.  You shave your pubes in the gym?  Well, in the shower.  I know.  I just think that's weird still. 
[00:13:00]  Why?  I don't know.  I shower, what I'll do is, a lot of times I'll take, I'll take a nice steam for fucking  a few minutes, and then I'll fucking shave right after, cause, like in the mirror, cause  it's fucking, you shave great after you take a steam, and then you fucking go, uh.  Meat gaze?  Yeah, meat gaze for a couple hours.  Why would you do it at home?  Cause I'm showering right there, so it's like, I'm gonna be in the shower, why, you  just fucking look down and shave your fucking dick, and I wash myself.  Because then if somebody gets in the shower after that, what if there's pubes on the  floor?  Fuck them, I wear fucking flip-flops to the floor. 
[00:13:30]  I never go barefoot in the gym.  Give the fuck.  I would, I would hate to see pubes on the floor.  Nah, dude, my pubes are fucking...  Well, then don't look for them.  Who looks on the, who looks at the floor?  I do, I would.  I never look at the floor.  I know, because I wear flip-flops.  Would you go barefoot in the gym?  No, hell no.  Well, then why do you care for it?  I wouldn't even take a shower in a gym.  Well, that's silly, the water's the same.  You're just a weirdo.  You're gonna stink going home?  That's silly.  Yeah, I go home and take a shower.  I don't shower all the time, but, you know, good shower after a workout, man.  I'm almost in a ritual.  Their water pressure's amazing.  It's amazing.  Amazing.  We don't get good water pressure here in New York. 
[00:14:00]  But there's never, I never see any funny business in the fucking, excuse my language,  I never see any...  Yeah, watch it.  But I never do in the locker room or anything, or the steam room, never.  I've never seen any weird shit.  I almost, I'd say 90% of the time I've been in that steam room, I'm alone.  Yesterday, there was a guy in there, and he was all toweled up, and he was just shaving,  which you're not supposed to do.  I've never seen bullshit in there.  So did you, you know, get him in trouble?  I wanted to joke with him and go, you know, you're not supposed to do that, but I was  afraid it would come off serious.  I'm like, oh, who wants to talk to him?  Fuck him. 
[00:14:30]  You're like, I've already thought about this person too much.  I just, yeah, I don't want to joke with him.  Yeah.  My mother-in-law was just up with some friends.  They went to a Broadway show, and they said they were getting, you know, pictures with  those characters in Times Square.  And I swear to you, this Saturday, I don't know if I talked about this yesterday, maybe  I did.  But it was Saturday, and I told him, I'm like, you've got to be careful.  They're lunatics.  And then I went online.  Maybe I did.  Did I say this on air or off air? 
[00:15:00]  I'm not sure.  Off air, I think.  I don't remember hearing it.  And then we started Google imaging all the pictures of these assholes being arrested with  their Elmo head off.  Yeah.  How humiliating.  They've got to hold their own Elmo head as they're in handcuffs.  So I was showing them the pictures, and they're like, oh my God, that's crazy.  Oh, God.  And sure enough, yesterday, it hit the paper that, you know, there was another incident  with one of these fucking characters in Times Square.  And now it's on the front page of the New York Post today.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  And which one was it?  Pushed a two-year-old.  Yeah, I think Cookie Monster pushed a two-year-old.  Yeah.  And I walked through Times Square recently, because I got a sister up from Florida, and we were walking  through, and she got a picture with one of these characters.  And they have absolutely changed, because now they aggressively show you a badge or something  that says, you know, a donation, please, or something like that.  They will not take a picture without harassing you for money.  Do they show you that first?  Huh?  Do they show you that first or after?  After, definitely. 
[00:16:00]  I mean, it's on where they're probably hoping you see it yourself.  If you don't see it, you know, they want to make it perfectly clear that they're not  doing you a favor, that you need to pay for the pictures.  And they kind of pushed the, you know, pressed the badge outward to show my sister.  And, you know, we gave them a couple bucks, whatever.  But they're very aggressive.  And it turns out, the other day, one of them pushed over a two-year-old, because, you know,  they took a picture, and, you know, what was it, Cookie Monster? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cookie costume creep faces rap for shoving two-year-old over tips.  So they took the picture, and then the mom wasn't paying whatever, and then he was aggressively  fucking going after the two-year-old and pushed.  Pushed the two-year-old.  Apparently, the woman went to, her husband went to get money out of the ATM to give a  tip or something.  At least they didn't have cash on him.  And the guy called the cops, and he did get arrested.  But imagine he pushed a two-year-old.  No, that would be it, man.  That's just fucking, that would be it. 
[00:17:00]  I kind of understand why these guys hate the public, too, because there's so many cheap  people.  It's annoying.  I mean, here's what the city ought to do, even though, hire a few guys to do this.  It wouldn't be that much money.  Well, that's what they're going to do now.  You know that.  And then just fucking say no tips, and then these guys are not allowed in Times Square.  Right.  Yeah.  These fucking, because they are douchebags, and they do wreck it for everybody.  And there's a lot of them.  There's a lot of these guys now.  So, that's a big story in Times Square today.  Yeah, they used to not be, like, they used to do it out in L.A. a lot.  Like, they would all do it in front of whatever, the Chinese theater. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  On, um...  Man's Chinese.  Man's Chinese theater.  Yeah, they used to...  What's the street that is?  Hollywood Boulevard.  Hollywood Boulevard.  Yeah.  Like, they used to have them all out there, and then at some point, they also are doing  it in New York.  They used to not do any of this.  Like, the naked cowboy was the only guy out there.  Right.  They all have, like, little backpacks on.  Yeah.  Where they put their money and shit, and it's a real deal.  It's the real deal.  They're not just doing it as a nice gesture and hoping to make a few bucks.  It's all...  They're making sure they're getting a tip for every single picture that is being taken. 
[00:18:00]  And you're right.  And they're pretty aggressive about it, but they usually don't push it.  Because it's illegal for them, I think, because they can't just say $5 for a picture  or whatever.  Because they don't have a vendor's license.  Right.  See, yeah, this is the point I'm trying to make.  Mike in San Francisco, he was in New York recently.  Go ahead, Mikey.  Hey, how you doing, bud?  Hey.  I was just there last week, you know, with the family visiting a couple games.  And we're walking through Times Square in the evening.  And all of a sudden, we see every character you could ever imagine all in one place, 
[00:18:30]  but at multiple amounts of them.  And so my kids are like, hey, look, you know, trying to talk to them.  But all of a sudden, they started talking to you.  So they were like, my kids were like, what the hell?  I've never heard Mickey Mouse talk.  And they're like, hey, come here, kid.  Let's take a picture, you know.  So they try to, you know, obviously get you to take the picture.  And after you're done, you're thinking like, oh, cool, thanks.  And you start walking away.  And they're like, hey, they start nudging you and telling you you need some money  because I'm, you know, hard up on money and I need help, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, they're pretty aggressive, you know.  Yeah.  And it might have been your intention not to take the picture.  You're just walking through and they're like kind of going, all right, come on here, take a picture.  Yeah, they pull a Virgil on you.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  They pull a Virgil.  Same deal.  It's kind of like the rap guys, too.  We're all of a sudden, they go, what's your name?  What's your name?  And they sign a CD.  And you're like, I didn't ask for my name on a fucking CD.  Yeah.  And then they're like, well, I can't sell it now, so, and they want money from you.  It's crazy that, like, in Times Square where they have this giant Disney store and everything, 
[00:19:30]  that nobody from Disney is walking around at any point and saying, you can't pretend to be our characters.  Well, I think.  They're all illegal.  Now that they went as far as push a two-year-old, you watch.  The city's going to shut this shit down.  Travis?  Yeah, what I noticed, I'll walk through and I'll see, you know, like, the thing that kind of looks like Hello Kitty  start taking a picture with some kid, and then, like, Batman just jumps in.  Right.  So the Batman can get a tip, too. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  You know, and then Mickey Mouse jumps in, and then Mickey Mouse gets a tip, too.  They're pieces of shit because they prey on kids and they prey on parents.  Right, right.  Right, because they know that a parent is not going to get into a fight with you in front of your kid.  You know what I mean?  For the most part, like, if you start demanding money from a parent and the kid is there,  the parent's just going to give you the money to get rid of the conflict.  I heard sometimes they, like, they pick the kid up and they hold the kid.  Yeah.  And then one of the things that sometimes they wait for the tip before they give the kid back.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, I don't know how aggressive they are with that. 
[00:20:30]  If you're a parent and you're letting, and you're just letting some guy in Times Square hold your kid to begin with,  like, you've got to shoot.  Yeah, exactly.  And the people walking through Times Square, they're just amazed at how tall the buildings are.  So, you know, they're easy prey.  Yeah, they're like.  They're such easy prey.  These characters come up like, hey, picture, and, you know.  Oh, sure.  And then they aggressively make sure you tip them.  Yeah, sure.  I'll take a picture with you that I think is free.  Yeah, this is it.  I mean, you know, this has been happening for years now.  But now that they pushed a two-year-old, you watch this, he's going to fucking move in now. 
[00:21:00]  And the guy looks like a scumbag.  He does, right?  They all are scumbags.  They're all scumbags.  You can feel their creepiness, even though they're wearing costumes.  Yeah.  And you can't even punch them because you'd want to hit them the mask.  The Elmo that got arrested, he took off his mask outside Toys R Us and just started yelling anti-Semitic.  Oh, right.  Yeah, that's a huge comment.  I hate Jews or something.  He had enough show business.  Outside of Toys R Us.  I'm not getting where I want to go. 
[00:21:30]  Enough with the Jews.  It's like you're in the wrong place.  They have the best, actually, in the paper today.  Damon Torres, 34, allegedly molested a 58-year-old grandmother in December while wearing a Super Mario costume like this one.  Then you got the bad Spider-Man.  An unnamed character has told the Post that he racked up more than 25 busts for various reasons while in costume last year.  So they're constantly arresting these guys.  The Cookie Monster guy allegedly pushed a two-year-old.  Okay, that's the new one.  And then the anti-Semitic Elmo.  Adam Sandler, his real name. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  48 allegedly screamed, I hate Jews, at Taurus in September.  So it's a fucking problem.  Yeah.  I'm really tired.  That's the problem with Times Square being like now it's a fucking, it's a waiting pool of just shit collecting and hanging out.  And then these guys, these kid guys come up with, the black guys with their CDs, like, hey, listen to this.  That's another part of the scam.  I always ask if they'll sign it for me.  Huh?  I always ask if they'll sign it for me.  That's the best way to do it because they don't want money.  Is I... 
[00:22:30]  No, because then they know that I know his ruse.  You know?  Because that's the game.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you sign it for me, too?  Yeah, you're going to sign it for me?  And then he laughs.  He's like, all right, this guy.  Because the thing is, fucking Bloomberg wants to make this fucking Disneyland.  Hey, pussy boy, we don't all get to walk down there with fucking, with people around us.  So why don't you make it comfortable for everybody?  I mean, it is New York.  You're going to get that.  It's gotten way more comfortable than what it used to be.  It's funny how, you know, Giuliani came in and cleaned everything up.  Cleaned everything up.  And now it is dirtier than it was, like, five years ago because they're just allowing all 
[00:23:00]  of these people to just con these tourists.  Yeah, a lot of creepiness.  Well, I mean, it started with the Naked Cowboy, and then everyone else was like, wow, that fucking  guy's racking up some dollars every day.  Yeah.  So then they moved in with their own people down there.  No, I know.  But with the attention the Naked Cowboy was getting, it made more people go down there  going, well, fuck, I can figure out something here.  And that's fine.  I'll put on a costume, and I'll demand tips for a picture.  I really, I don't care about, like, the Naked Cowboy or anything, but I just, there's  something about these guys that are just preying on children and parents. 
[00:23:30]  They're just standing outside Toys R Us where they know they're going to get kids coming  out, and the kid's going to say, I want a picture.  And not everyone is like you or me that's going to say no.  Right.  You know?  I don't trust anyone that, you can't see their fucking eyes.  DTA.  You can't see their fucking eyes.  There's something going on.  Of course there is.  Yeah.  You don't know what the fuck's going on under that mask.  I'm not going to let some bum pick my kid up.  No, of course not.  I don't even like them looking at my kid. 
[00:24:00]  Would you like that crazy guy with the lipstick that we used to work next to pick up your kid  for a photo?  No.  No, it's the same guy.  He's just got a costume on.  I was walking in the park yesterday with my kid, and an old guy with a mustache is  looking at my kid.  I wanted to yell, you're a pedophile.  Same thing.  Put a cookie monster ass on.  It's so obvious who the pedophiles are.  You'll see, Sam, when you get a kid.  I mean, look at him.  That would be a great reality show.  I'll walk around with my kid, and I swear to you, I could find, out of ten creepy looking 
[00:24:30]  dudes, I guarantee I could figure out which ones are the fucking pedophiles or not.  It's so obvious.  Do they always look creepy, or is it sometimes you could just like...  It's just how they look at your kid.  It's just, you just know.  But do you ever catch, like, a guy in, like, a suit that, you know, has a family, and...  Not really.  It's always, like, a creepy, like, older guy by himself.  Or they just look creepy, because you just have that extra sense.  Something happens when that kid pops out. 
[00:25:00]  They turn on the fucking pedophile switch in your brain, so you're aware.  And you can spot him.  I fucking see him walking around.  It's so obvious.  Plus, you have a cute kid, so it's like, that's pedophile bait right there.  All of them are gonna be looking.  All right, relax.  I'm just saying.  Relax.  Hey, hey.  Relax.  I'm just saying.  I'm getting a pedophile fucking mad.  I said the same thing to your mom.  It's a delight.  Horrible.  Giuliani cleaned that place up, and now Bloomberg led them all back. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, exactly.  It's sort of what Travis is saying.  Yeah, there's definitely a creepy element down there.  I mean, because, like, Disney and whoever owns Sesame Street, like, they can't regulate this.  Like, you can't be serving papers to, like, everyone that comes in with a Mickey Mouse costume,  so it's something the city has to do.  So, and unless they're causing trouble, like Cookie Monster pushing a two-year-old down,  they're not gonna do anything.  Let's get our MMA fighter friends to go down there for a day.  Yeah.  Take pictures?  Yeah, and see if they're gonna fucking aggressively fucking demand a tip from a monster. 
[00:26:00]  We are gonna get it legalized soon, I think.  Yeah, no, they're gonna have to move in now and get some kind of dumb permit system, whatever.  I don't necessarily agree with that, but what are you gonna do?  When they start pushing two-year-olds, you know, something has to change.  Speaking of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, Annette Funicello died.  We just featured her on the show recently.  Oh, yeah.  Huh?  I saw recently they featured Annette Funicello, and she was in a bad fucking way. 
[00:26:30]  What did she have, MS?  Yeah.  She had the really, really bad version of MS.  There's different versions of MS.  Yeah, but she had, I mean, we liked that video.  She had the one where she basically was frozen in time.  Yeah.  She was barely moving.  She had no facial expressions. 
[00:27:00]  She had a guy that was absolutely taking care of her.  She was lucky in that way, and she died of, obviously, of complications from MS.  So, oh, here's the, yeah, play that.  Taste of it.  It's terrible.  Let me see.  Hey, you look awful good.  This is Annette Funicello today.  She's 70 years old, can no longer walk or speak.  The price of progressive MS.  I'm sorry that she's this way.  I would love to have her back dancing and singing and doing everything she always loved to do, 
[00:27:30]  but she can't do it.  He said Annette tried almost every treatment for MS to no avail.  This is fucked up, man.  That's just torture.  She looks like a mannequin.  A mannequin in a wheelchair.  And she, you know, thank God, she moved on.  So her brain is active in there the whole time?  Supposedly, yeah.  Supposedly the brain is right there.  That's horrifying.  Yeah.  Look at Stephen Hawking.  He's different, but I mean, it's the same thing. 
[00:28:00]  You're trapped in your own fucking body.  Yeah, and your whole thing.  She's in there somewhere, and she can't even tell the fucking guy, look, my armpit itches.  Could you itch it for me?  Nothing.  Yeah.  So what do you do in that situation?  Do you just itch your body every hour just in case there might be an itch?  No.  There's nothing you can do.  Well, maybe you just deal with it after a while?  Maybe where they put cream on.  I don't know.  Just horrible.  So she's no longer with us.  So many things they need to work on with medical fucking funds. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  Cancer they're going to get soon, I think.  I'm hoping at least.  But that drug that they're working on now, hopefully they'll have a big impact on cancer.  AIDS eventually is going to go.  But like MS, all that shit.  There's a lot of stuff to be done.  Parkinson's.  Parkinson's is terrible too, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, we saw that guy going into WrestleMania.  It was depressing.  We were asking an old guy where we could park and his fucking right hand was rocking.  No, both his hands were shaking.  Both his hands and his head.  Just rocking. 
[00:29:00]  I mean, I get out of the car and I bullied him for a little while.  That's what I do.  Well, you can.  Yeah, he's really old and female.  It's WrestleMania.  Yeah, I was poking him in the chest.  He's like, okay, son.  And I'm like, what the fuck are you saying?  But the young guys, I'm careful of because they hit back.  But the old guys, I'll just bully him.  Just a little something to make you feel better.  Yeah, I was toughened up a little bit.  I was like, I love WWE on him, yeah.  Yeah.  A little UFC on him.  You know, the one thing we forgot to mention yesterday, $30 to park for WrestleMania?  Is that how much it was? 
[00:29:30]  I thought you...  The parking's now up to $30 for events?  Well, you know what they did?  That's so fucking ridiculous.  And they do it differently for different events.  Right.  Because their FanFest deal, the day before WrestleMania, it was $20 to park.  Right.  And then the very next day, in the same parking lot, the same spot was $30 to park.  Really?  Yeah.  Just the brilliance of the whole thing.  I mean, back in the day, you got a ticket for an event.  Let's just go with sporting events.  And they supplied parking for you. 
[00:30:00]  Of course.  And now, it's like they figured out a way, like, no, the ticket's not good enough.  Now you've got to pay a pretty ridiculous amount of money to park in our parking lot for the event.  Yeah, it's stadium-owned parking.  Although, they basically farm that out to another company, I've heard, but still.  Yeah, there's a lot.  Like, all those parking lots by Yankee Stadium, they're not owned by the Yankees.  But I'm just going to the Islanders game.  But they know.  I mean, you're not going to turn around and say, okay, I'm not going to WrestleMania tonight.  I know.  For $30, what the fuck? 
[00:30:30]  They find that price that you're outraged just enough.  Right.  You know, if it was $50, then there would just be an uproar.  And I feel bad for the driver, because you know you're not collecting the money from your fucking asshole pals.  No.  You're not turning around going, all right, it's $30, let's do this.  You're stuck with the fucking $30.  Of course, yeah.  Price.  The guy in the passenger seat is just looking out the other window, like, all right, pay the guy.  Yeah, the next thing you know, you look around, everyone's on their phones, making believe.  Making believe they don't see the big $30 to park sign.  That is a lot of money.  That is way too much. 
[00:31:00]  You're reading up on Annette Funicello?  No, I'm just this stalker.  I can't even look at it.  It makes me so fucking angry.  What happened?  Just the people who stalk.  I just...  Who's stalking?  There's a bunch of celebrities.  Alec Baldwin's apparently got this stalking case now.  And then I just...  There's one way to deal with these fucking people.  There's one way to deal with them.  Ask them to stop?  Yeah, that always works.  Just ask them nicely.  They usually go away if you ask them nicely.  The self-centeredness of them, I just...  I can't describe how badly I wish that we could handle them the way the Russians would handle a criminal. 
[00:31:30]  Or the way...  Herman had a bad one.  She still does.  Oh, yeah.  And Trump's daughter has one.  And fucking...  There's so many of these...  And there's...  Again, there should be a way that after a certain amount of times when a person stalks someone,  not even a celebrity, just any person, the only answer is to fucking put them down.  That's it.  There's no other answer.  These fucking people, they should be put down.  They are valueless to the rest of us.  You're torturing someone. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, God, are they fucking...  Like, Trump's daughter has one.  I don't care how much money you have.  Can you imagine knowing your daughter was getting stalked by some fucking creep?  Ugh.  Fucking...  I just haven't looked at that.  I'm looking at this fucking woman's face.  It just makes me sick.  Is it the Alec Baldwin one?  Yeah.  And then Brian Cashman has something going on with him, too.  I don't know all the details.  She's crazy.  This woman...  What is it?  Yeah, what is she doing to Alec Baldwin?  I don't know.  She says she fucked him.  She may have.  I mean, my guess is they went out and he probably banged her and then ignored her. 
[00:32:30]  It was probably something like that.  I mean, that's a lot of times what gets somebody crazy.  But it was 2010 and apparently she hasn't stopped.  And, like, they offered her a plea deal where there's no criminal charges, but she couldn't  come within 10 blocks of it, but she rejected the plea deal to go to trial.  And her own lawyer and her just split for due to irreconcilable.  Like, her lawyer and her couldn't see...  And it's just...  It makes my fucking fist tighten up.  And she's from...  I think she's from Canada. 
[00:33:00]  She can't just move on?  She'll never stop.  No, they never do.  The difference is women don't kill you.  But if she's in Canada, does she come around a lot?  Oh, she's here in New York.  So it's for the trial or she's living here now?  No, she lives here now.  I think she should be thrown out.  All right.  So she's living in New York.  That fucking blows.  They never stop.  And that's why women are killed by their stalkers.  Men are usually not killed.  Men are just harassed, like annoyed, which we're lucky.  Right.  But the only answer is the fucking...  She won't stop because there's no penalty.  Like, they just want her to stay away.  Yeah.  That's what they're telling you.  They should throw you in jail. 
[00:33:30]  They should literally...  The penalty for stalking should be fucking horrible.  Right.  Because you're such an invasive cunt.  Now it makes sense because I saw Alec Baldwin twice in our neighborhood and he walks in traffic.  And I saw it the first time and I thought that was a little strange.  And then I saw it the second time.  But now it makes perfect sense.  There are people that are so fucking famous they'd rather walk with the cars than be bothered  on the sidewalk every block.  Because I couldn't figure out why he would do something like that.  And he was walking against traffic on Columbus Avenue one afternoon. 
[00:34:00]  And it's probably because of this.  He probably feels safer with the cars than with the stalkers on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  He really has a hard time with this.  I mean, being famous comes with a penalty.  You know, you lose your privacy.  Well, that's what they say.  You don't get that with silly fame.  Well, no.  But you could get stalkers with silly fame.  Oh, yeah.  I've had stalkers with silly fame.  You don't need to be famous to get stalked.  And he has the paparazzi.  Like, again, I understand that he's famous and people are interested in his life. 
[00:34:30]  But he's one of those guys, too, that got mad a few times.  Oh, yeah.  And so now they go crazy with him.  Like, he's him and, like, Sean Penn.  They'll push him even more.  Yeah.  They know.  Like, once you start to get mad and show that you don't like them, they're like,  oh, shit, this guy's a goldmine, you know?  Yeah.  And so they're going out of their way to make sure that they can get him as riled up as humanly  possible.  Right.  But I'm just looking at this woman's face and I...  Is it punchable?  I just hate her.  Like, I don't even know.  Because, again, it's obvious the guy doesn't want to talk to you or be around you. 
[00:35:00]  Just fucking go away.  What do you want?  Go away.  Well, I just need to.  But I just need to have a conversation.  Just fucking die.  But then you have that conversation.  That's not good enough.  There is no conversation.  There's no conversation.  No.  With any of these people.  They want to just nudge their way into your lives.  They're fucking...  And again, this is...  The men and the women are the same in this one.  The men are just more violent.  But they're cancers.  They're fucking...  This is why I fucking hate mental illness. 
[00:35:30]  And I fucking...  I'm so sick of people with the talking about...  Well, I'm mentally ill.  Like, I understand it's not your fault sometimes.  But this is the type of shit.  Well...  We look at the fucking Newtown shooter.  That's the mental illness we get angry at.  But not this kind.  We don't say that this person is valueless and should be locked up.  You think mentally ill people take any responsibility?  No!  No, because in my life, they don't.  No.  No way. 
[00:36:00]  But are there mentally ill people out there that actually take responsibility and there's  an awareness that their mental illness is affecting people around them?  Yeah, I'm sure there are, actually.  I'm sure there are.  I don't know.  I don't know the answer to that.  There are people who try to get better and they know that they're fucked up and they go  for help and they go to therapy.  I think there's people that do try and do like...  They look for medication that might help them.  They go to whatever.  And I think there's people that really do make serious efforts.  Because the lack of awareness is what drives me nuts.  I mean, we all know mentally ill people. 
[00:36:30]  But their lack of awareness on it is unbelievable.  Yeah, I'm just fucking so sick of them.  It's the lack of awareness or the lack of caring.  Yeah.  The lack of these narcissist fucks.  So you think they're aware, but they don't give a fuck?  Some cases, sure.  Yeah, probably some cases.  I think a lot of times that they're not...  Unless...  Yeah, you have to become aware and then medicate.  Go out and reach out and medicate and then stay medicated.  Because a lot of times, too, they'll start... 
[00:37:00]  They'll be like, okay, something...  There'll be some kind of catalyst.  Like, they'll do something to somebody that they love.  And they go, okay, this is obviously a problem.  So then they go and get the medication.  But then the minute they feel better, they think that they're fine.  So then they stop using the medication again.  Yeah.  The bottom line is they care more about what they want than you not wanting to be bothered.  That's the basic self-centered obsession that these pieces of shit have is they care about what they want. 
[00:37:30]  And the fact that you don't want them around is irrelevant.  I'm not talking about when a marriage is breaking up and both people see it different.  When someone doesn't want...  I just have to say...  I just...  It's all I.  I just need to.  But I just need to have this.  But I just need to...  And it's like...  You don't need to, you narcissist cock.  But they also, like a lot of them, in my experience anyway, have people in their lives...  What kind of experience do you got with mental illness? 
[00:38:00]  I got plenty of experience.  I'm calling you out on that.  Who do you know?  I'm not going to start listing people.  Who do you know?  I don't know.  Someone keeps his hair in a jar at home.  Just start there.  But they have people that, like, are coddling them, too.  Of course.  Like, they all have family members that are sitting there...  Those are called enablers, Sam.  Enabling them.  Which means you don't know this shit.  Oh, shit.  Because I'm not using the right vocabulary.  That's right.  It's called being an enabler.  And those fuckers are sick, too.  Everyone in these people's lives should be saying, you are an absolute cancer. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  Who brings nothing to anyone.  Who do you know?  And you'd be better off doing it.  Who do you know?  I'm not going to say.  Be vague.  Well, I can't be...  I mean, I can tell you it's family members, but I can't be...  Close family members?  Yeah.  But I can't be more vague than that.  Very close family members?  I mean, you know who I know.  I don't know who it is.  Yes, you do.  Are you doing your mom?  No, it's not my mom.  I hope not.  It's not in my immediate family.  She's nice.  Then how would I know?  Because people have spoken to me.  Oh, I do know.  Of course you do.  I know.  It's Jess.  Of course you know. 
[00:39:00]  Yes, you know.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, fuck.  That's pretty close.  Fair enough.  Sam has very...  You do have some experience.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  I apologize.  You know.  But you should have said enabler.  You should have said that.  Yeah, it's a nightmare, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you see the people, not only the mentally ill people, but the people that are coddling  them and making it so that it's okay.  Wait, who coddles in this situation?  Completely self-centered. 
[00:39:30]  Be vague.  Who coddles?  I've never seen the coddling.  There's coddling.  By...  I don't know.  You just made it...  Well, I'm...  Coming with arthritis?  Yeah, I don't know.  No, I'm just, I'm just like, you know, giving the sign of big boobs.  Right.  Yeah, I don't know what that means.  I'm just trying to figure out if it's a female or male.  Oh, there are females that coddle.  See, if it was male, I would have been like, you know...  Right.  Dick.  Dick.  It's like dick.  Dick. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of family members that coddle.  You know who doesn't bother me?  Mentally retarded people.  People with Down syndrome can't help themselves.  Like, when you see somebody...  Oh, that's very bothersome.  But they don't...  Literally, that type of mental illness, I...  As much as, you know, I'm sick and tired of hearing the word, the R word, but I mean,  they are mentally ill, and I feel for them.  They give really good hugs.  They are.  They just want to be loved.  They're very nice.  They give very, very good hugs.  They're very strong.  Yes.  But that type of mental illness that is not as easily identifiable... 
[00:40:30]  Because you see somebody who's retarded, you know they're retarded.  Right.  And they'll help you move a couch all day long.  They don't give a fuck, man.  They just want...  They're not going to bitch about it.  You say, hey, man, you take that side of the couch.  We got to get this up 40 stories.  They just want to be helpful.  Yes.  Constantly.  But we know they're mentally ill.  We look at them.  But the people who you can't just tell by looking at them, and they have enough intelligence to justify their behavior.  Oh, they're fucking hateful.  I have to go to Kevin and Philly.  By the way, the Flyers are going to get their asses kicked tonight by the Islanders. 
[00:41:00]  I'm going to my first hockey game of the year, yay, with my brothers.  Kevin and Philly, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  I have a family member that has schizophrenia, and I agree with you that most of it is coddling and things like that.  I don't coddle, but she actually admitted at once that she was at fault for her disease, and she didn't understand why it happened to her.  And I got to say, that made me feel pretty crappy about not coddling her, but I still don't. 
[00:41:30]  Because I think there's a combination, right?  Like, people can't help certain things, and you feel for them, and you're empathetic.  But then it becomes the part that mental illness, and I've said this a million times, is not addressed, is the selfishness of it.  Like, we always address the part where they can't help it, it's not their fault.  That's all you hear with it, and I know that that's true.  Well, when I used to get my mom in a corner, like, when I finally had her on some shit, and she had no way out, she would pull out that car, and she'd go, 
[00:42:00]  Well, you know, I'm mentally ill.  I'm like, well, that's not good enough, though.  Moments like that guy's talking about are like these little fleeting things that happen, but then they're forgotten about.  So, like, the person will say, like, yeah, you know, I'm really sorry that I'm doing this,  and I know it's my fault, I just can't help it.  And you'll have that moment where you, as a rational human being, will take it in and remember it.  But that person who said that is not going to, that's not going to be their mind frame for another 15 minutes.  We can't look at them as equals. 
[00:42:30]  I'm just less than.  I'm just sick of them.  We can't look at them as equals.  We've got to start there.  Number one, they're on the lower.  Yeah, they don't get a full vote.  We're stuck.  They don't get a full vote.  So, Kevin, you all right with that shit or what?  Yeah, I'm all right.  And I have to agree with Sam is because, you know, 15 minutes later, it's completely different.  Right.  And it's just, it's my recollection of it that's bad.  I just don't think that she recognizes that moment later in time.  It's kind of fun, though, because it's like living with 10 different people. 
[00:43:00]  Well.  That's kind of fun.  You never know which version you're going to get.  Go Friars.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  Go Phillies.  The problem is most of those people you have no interest in being around.  Most of those 10 people.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Maybe two out of the 10, maybe.  Yeah.  Not that it's multiple personalities.  It's just different fucking versions of that person.  Right.  They go to extremes.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And most people aren't that extreme. 
[00:43:30]  Most people don't have that.  Most people, again, that's the part they can't help, but there's that little self-centered  fucking nugget that they refuse to acknowledge.  And no one addresses it.  You know, they can't help themselves.  And for every moment, like this guy says, that they go, you know, I'm sorry.  This is my fault.  And I'm trying to get better.  There's 150,000 moments where they're blaming everybody else in the room.  Yeah.  You're going to tell me a stalker doesn't know not to pick up the phone.  Or they just show up. 
[00:44:00]  Well, they know enough to put their fucking pants on.  They know enough to get dressed.  They know enough to fucking, to where the person's going to be.  That's how they get contact.  Right.  So they know enough how to satisfy what they want.  Right.  They know what to do to get what they want.  So I don't believe that they're so, because if they were so unaware, they'd be in a room  running around going, hey, celebrity person, celebrity person.  But they don't do that.  They calculate.  They lurk.  They know exactly where to go and what time to be there and how to do it. 
[00:44:30]  So fuck them.  They absolutely know how to get what they want.  But when it comes to doing what somebody else wants, they don't give a fuck.  We're talking about two-year-olds, Tom Papa.  Yeah.  They're just terrible people.  Just to fill you in, we're talking about two-year-olds.  I couldn't figure that one out.  You look confused.  We're just talking about two-year-olds and how selfish they are.  And they should have more awareness.  It's not two-year-olds.  What was it, Jimmy?  Just a fucking plague of mental illness in this fucking country with stalkers. 
[00:45:00]  It's a stalker's thing.  I'm reading about a stalker in the paper.  And I have such a fucking loathing for these people that won't stop calling.  It's a loathing where I really wish they would, I mean this, put a gun in their own  mouth and do us all a favor.  You are better off dead.  Now you're extra excited about it today.  You got something going on?  No, I do not actually.  I have in my life.  No, I know you have in the past.  So I was wondering if something popped up.  No, it's just whenever I read about people like this or you read about women being victimized 
[00:45:30]  by these fucking cocksucker, weak, fucking faggot ex-husbands who can't let go.  I just, I have such a hatred for these people.  It's one of the things I hate the most in the world is people who are stalkers.  To catch up, Tom Papa, mental illness, stalkers, two-year-olds being pushed over by the cookie  monster in Times Square.  And...  Girls in short shorts.  And I lost my fucking mind yesterday because it was the first real day of... 
[00:46:00]  Did you notice yesterday?  Of course.  What is that?  It's just, it's that first day.  It just...  Where they just say fuck and they rip off all their clothes and it's just so like raw.  It's so funny because if you're in LA for a while, it's just, it's so all over the place  all year round.  You don't even notice it.  Well, no, you notice it...  People are covered up for so long.  Right.  And it's just, everyone's walking around in these cloaks every month after month.  And when they break out, it's like, oh my God. 
[00:46:30]  Usually it's on a level you could kind of like, you know it's there and you're handling it.  But yesterday, I'm with my son in a park and I'm like, he's trying to tell me to watch  him and I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I couldn't believe it.  It was, yeah.  And a lot of these women were like fives.  I'm not even talking about like hot women.  It was just the fact that they had no clothes on.  I know.  Or very little.  It's like seeing any woman like on a golf course.  It's like, they're not supposed to be here.  So you're excited.  It could be a whale, but you're just like, oh my God, that's a woman. 
[00:47:00]  Look at the skirt.  She's got her golf skirt on.  Yes.  So it's been long.  It's because it's stretched out.  We were supposed to see this like three weeks ago.  Yeah, a couple weeks, right?  Yeah.  Yesterday was the day though, man.  It was so noticeable.  So noticeable.  But do you have like a, because you're married, you have become more of an annoyance.  Would you rather they just be cloaked up again?  No, no, no.  I mean, I like to, I mean, I really like, like just looking and I'm fine with that. 
[00:47:30]  I really am just fine with that.  I am to a point and then it's like, all right, just put, all right.  I can't have that.  All right, exactly.  Why are you teasing me like this?  But imagine being a caveman and spring hit and there were no rules yet.  Holy fuck.  You get at your lady club and just run through the fields.  Wow.  Donk.  They were onto something back then.  I know.  Who ruined that?  Yeah.  The other part is you're really onto something when you, when you have the Islamic guys covering 
[00:48:00]  everything up.  It's like, I just can't take it.  Right.  If you want me to focus, these women are going to have to be in a garbage bag.  Yeah.  I'll want to see their eyes or not even their eyes in some cases.  I'll never.  We have a lovely culture.  We have a ridiculous.  Lovely people.  I'll never get, I'll never get used to that.  We were, uh, we were just outside Wildwood last year for a week and, uh, uh, a Muslim  family goes to the beach.  She is head to toe.  Yeah.  Completely covered.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  He's in American swim, fucking, uh, an American swimsuit.  Right.  Of course.  And she's fucking putting the suntan lotion on him and he's in a beach chair all  nice.  Oh my God.  And it's a hot fucking day where you're just getting enough breeze off the water and  she's got to be suffering in that.  Yeah.  Cause they're garbage and the men are everything.  That's, that's the lovely culture.  And the kids are running around and they look American eyes is the only way I can explain  it, I guess.  Yeah.  And she has to sit on the blanket, not in a chair. 
[00:49:00]  And I'm like that, that is just the most amazing.  I just will never wrap my head.  It's ownership.  It really feel like it's like a guy.  It's like they own them.  And people you could see are looking at the guy like, dude, relax.  You're an asshole.  You will not look at my woman.  And the idea of culture.  And I know it's a religious thing and you gotta be careful with that shit, but it's so weird  to look at from where we're coming from.  Did I tell you the story when I was with Whitney Cummings in, uh, in Beirut?  Are you name dropping right now?  Maybe a year ago. 
[00:49:30]  You were in Beirut.  I was in Beirut.  I did stand-up in Beirut.  Fuck.  And, uh...  I wish you'd go and do it in Syria.  I might actually sell a ticket in Syria at this point.  No, but I went to Beirut.  We went to Dubai and then Beirut to do these stand-up shows.  And, uh, we're in Beirut and we're just walking around, Whitney and I.  And we just met on this little tour.  And we were just friendly. 
[00:50:00]  We were cool.  You know, she was really nice and funny.  And we were just hanging out.  And we were in Beirut and we're just...  It's this beautiful day and we're just going walking around sightseeing before the show,  like during the day.  And she's in short shorts, like a half shirt.  She's got a scarf, like, around her neck.  These big sunglasses...  No, around her head, like a scarf.  And, uh, big sunglasses.  She just looks really, really hot.  But we're just friends.  And I'm not really that, you know...  Not like, oh, I'm going to hit on her or anything like that. 
[00:50:30]  I'm just...  She looks amazing, but we're just hanging out.  It's fine.  So we're just walking around.  We see a mosque with this beautiful, beautiful mosque in the center of Beirut.  Everyone says, you got to go to this mosque.  We get to the mosque.  We walk in.  It's just beautiful and quiet and big ceilings and everything.  And this, those carpets.  And the guy comes running up and says, she has to cover her.  She has to cover everything.  Everything.  She has to cover her.  So they put the thing on her.  What do they call it?  The, uh...  I don't know.  Sari?  Yeah.  The I'm sorry.  Yeah, the burka.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  They put it on.  He's like, no, to the floor.  So she had to zip from down from the floor.  Only thing sticking out is her face.  Just her little face.  Not even her hair.  Not even her eyebrows.  All of a sudden, after being with her in this sexy outfit all night and not nothing, walk...  And she had to follow me.  So she had to stay at my side and walk around.  I was so turned on.  I was like, seriously.  Because now, no, only I knew what was under there.  Right.  And she's now like my property.  Wow.  I was like, you've got to get this thing off or I'm going to attack you. 
[00:51:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  You've got to get back in American clothes.  It was a...  It is a weird property thing.  Yeah.  But why would she have any...  This is the question for anyone.  Why have any interest in experiencing that culture if you're a woman?  Yeah.  That's literally like me as a man.  If I walked in and they're like, all right, well, you have to carry this fucking fishbowl full of horse shit.  And you can walk around.  Like, I have zero interest in experiencing that culture.  Right.  They don't really have a choice.  I mean, people won't leave their hometown because, you know, it's too scary to move to a better place because you're going to leave family and friends behind. 
[00:52:00]  It's amazing.  Those cultures are so abusive.  I mean, like adultery.  Like, if there's adultery, the woman, a lot of times the guy will be fine and the town will stone the woman because she's a woman and she asked for it.  That's just...  It's a savage way of looking at women and it's in...  It's like...  I understand, like, being with Whitney because she's a friend.  There's something taboo or weird with the dynamics of a friend change. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  But that's how they treat their girlfriends and...  It's so bizarre.  It really is strange.  Did you see in Egypt, in Tahrir Square, how they're raping women?  In Tahrir Square where they had that spring awakening and the whole thing.  And it was this amazing...  You know, we thought it was going to be this rebirth.  And now the head of the police said, women are getting raped in that same square now.  They can't be alone there.  A journalist was there and for, like, five hours she was just sexually abused. 
[00:53:00]  And it's just their way of thinking.  And they...  The head of the police said, women are 100% responsible for rape.  Jesus.  Just because they are women.  I mean, this is how archaic and backwards this thinking is.  We were talking recently, I mean, most of the world is archaic.  I know.  We're so...  I'll say it every day now.  We're so lucky that we were born in America.  No kidding.  Think about it.  We're women being born here.  How lucky are women to be born here?  Exactly.  My God.  I'm trying to figure out the percentage of Earth, the world, that is relatively living normally. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, in modern times.  What do you think?  Like, it's less than 50%, right?  Much less than 50%.  You think?  Well, yeah.  I mean, Africa's...  I think it's China.  China, Europe.  Modern, yeah.  Russia.  Russia.  Canada.  North, South America.  You take the Middle East.  You take Africa.  That's the...  That's...  Those are two massive areas that have a very different way of life.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They treat their ladies a little differently in that part of town. 
[00:54:00]  Mexico.  Any culture that just treats their women terribly like that is a shitty culture.  It's like we find, like, well, it's their...  That's how they were...  Like, we look at all this stuff and we excuse it.  And sometimes, you know what?  Some cultures are just shitty.  And they have shitty parts of them.  And if you throw rocks at a woman who was raped, your culture is shitty.  Any...  I don't care who you are.  You're right.  I don't care why you do it.  If a woman gets raped and somehow...  You're not that fucking backwards.  Like, everyone in that town or wherever you live understands, I have to eat to survive. 
[00:54:30]  I have to wipe my ass after I shit.  I have to put windows on so the rain stays out.  There's a certain understanding that they're intelligent human beings.  Right.  But that intelligence still goes when a woman is raped.  They still will throw rocks at her.  Yeah.  That culture is shitty.  Do you think deep down they understand that, though?  Yes.  Or, if they don't understand it, the only thing I can chalk it up to is that their culture  is shitty.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if they understand it.  I don't think they do.  I'm not sure they do.  That's what's so creepy about it. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  The women must be like, what the hell?  Are you kidding me?  But...  Maybe they don't.  But maybe not.  I mean, you know, when things start off when you're really...  When you're a tiny, tiny kid.  Right.  It just becomes reality.  Yep.  But you're right.  And we end up having to make excuses for it.  Like, you always...  Well, it's...  But it's them.  Well, it's their religion.  Well, it's their...  We're always making excuses.  It's like, no, let's just call it out.  Why is religion so sacred?  Right.  Sacred?  Who gives a fuck it's his religion?  Then walk away from your dumb religion, whatever your religion, and walk away from it.  Stop abusing another human being in the name of it. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  It's like they act like religion is not a choice.  It's a choice.  When you're a kid, it's not.  But the older you get, you can choose to walk away from it.  And if you're not intelligent enough to look at the teachings of any of your religion  and go, wow, that's fucking horrific, and that's barbaric, and that's unfair,  then you're guilty.  You're fucking guilty.  Yeah.  It annoys me.  Because we do excuse the, well, you know, yes, Sarah.  Really?  But you don't...  It's true.  We're selective with that.  It's like saying if you saw your father beat your mother, you're not going to watch an 
[00:56:00]  abusive couple in the street and watch a guy beating a woman and then feel that way.  Well, you know, he was raised that way.  You're going to go, who cares?  Of course, if he's an adult, he knows right from wrong.  Same way with religion.  Yeah.  You're an adult.  Yeah.  And it's just that culture.  Wow.  The show's getting really serious.  It's not so serious.  It's just exploratory.  We were talking about meat gazing in the locker rooms.  I can't believe how much ground you covered that list by the time I even got here at seven. 
[00:56:30]  Well, me and Jimmy...  It's a long list.  Before we take our first break, me and Jimmy work out at the same gym, and yesterday we  were both very bummed that the two creeps weren't in the locker room.  Oh, they weren't?  Because we enjoy how creepy they are.  I like hearing about the creeps.  And, you know, the hardcore audience has heard this many times, but it's worth repeating.  There's a guy that talks to a black guy in our gym.  I've heard it.  Oh, okay.  You even heard it.  Yeah.  But the guy won't start talking to him until he gets completely naked.  The white guy. 
[00:57:00]  So do you think...  The white old Jewish guy has to get completely naked, and then the black guy will, you know,  we'll talk to him, and they talk about the Knicks.  So who's pushing it in the relationship?  Who's pushing it, Jim?  The creepy old white guy.  He's the guy that gets it going?  I don't know.  And he knows the black guy loves talking basketball, but he will not give him that until he's naked.  Because the black guy works in the locker room.  He's not going to get naked.  Right.  But Jimmy says that he plays with his fly a little bit. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, I've seen him fumbling with his zipper.  Fumbling a little bit.  I think he's a little slow.  Like, I don't think he's retarded, but I think he's a little...  He's a basic guy.  Right.  You know...  Uh-huh.  I don't know who pushes it.  I don't see enough of it.  I just see it...  I don't see how it starts.  Like, is the nakedness a treat for the black guy, or is the black guy...  Well, the guy's so awful naked.  His cock is terrible.  His balls are awful.  The nakedness, it symbolizes some kind of dominance or some kind of a weird thing.  It's not...  I don't think he looks at me and goes, well, that guy's got a great body. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  Um...  I don't know what it means.  But who's in control?  The old guy.  No, the old guy.  The old guy, because he's obviously rich.  Right.  Um, and the other guy works in the locker room, so...  Right.  Probably the old guy that takes care of him here and there, too.  A few...  Oh, yeah.  A few bucks here and there.  Oh, yeah.  The guy will fumble clumpily with his fly and his big dumb dick is inside of his fucking  pants.  And the little old naked guy with his fucking, I have a small cock fetish humiliation will throw  him a 50 once in a while while gazing at his cock bulge. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, there's some kind of creepy dynamic between these two.  So he wasn't there yesterday, so me and Jimmy kind of got bummed, and then we turned the  corner and the other guy wasn't there either.  I like that.  So we were in a weird way where we were both bummed, because it makes us laugh.  You guys are there, like...  We start laughing as soon as we see this shit.  People are pumping iron and it's like, ah!  You're like, waiting for a show inside the locker room.  The other guy is the scrolling guy and it's phony, just like this, just scrolling, scrolling  constantly.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but you could film doing that. 
[00:59:00]  I think he's filming this.  I don't know if he's filming.  Oh, really?  I think he's just trying to look like he's got shit to do, and there's a reason why he's  in the locker room every single fucking time I'm in there.  He's just acting all-important.  I don't know.  I had a psychopath at the gym the other day who had a full New York Times.  I thought you were going to say a full rod.  Exactly.  A full rod, just running around and tagging us.  Who says a full New York Times?  I didn't realize he worked out at the same gym.  He's on the treadmill.  You know, some people, like, they half-ass it and they put the papers up and they got a 
[00:59:30]  whole thing going.  The coffee.  This guy had the newspaper, and as he's reading the paper, he's taking a sheet and just  throwing it behind them.  No.  So around this treadmill behind them is this psychopath.  It's just newspapers just littered around on the floor.  It's like, why?  Another guy that doesn't give a fuck.  Just a selfish cut that there's other people in that space.  Yeah, no one's saying anything because you think, well, he must be a psychopath.  He's just selfish.  He's just selfish.  Yeah, in a gym, a public gym.  Yeah, did he pick the stuff up when he was done? 
[01:00:00]  Yes.  But that went on for like an hour, and there's just glitter.  All around him.  Yeah, he's just a selfish cunt.  And the bottom line is, but I understand why you don't approach a guy like that, because  he could be crazy, and he wants to get fucking their face bitten.  Right.  But employees, they should have two guys at work that are trainers, and their employees  walk over and go, if you do this again, we will throw you out, and you will not get  your money back.  It's a selfish fuck.  Exactly.  It shouldn't be on us.  The citizens shouldn't have to do it.  Amazing.  With that, let's take a break. 
[01:00:30]  Tom Popper's sitting in today.  You got anything going on, Tom?  Yeah.  Next week, I'm going to be at Bananas, and I have a pre-sale tomorrow.  If you follow me on Twitter, I have a pre-sale for a big show going in Philadelphia at the  Kimmel Center.  Wow, really?  Yeah, which is a beautiful theater, and it's going to be a big show, so I'm going to put  that up for pre-sale tomorrow.  That's pretty exciting.  How many seats?  6.50.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, it's a nice theater.  My special comes out in the summer. 
[01:01:00]  You taped it already?  For Epics and Netflix.  Yeah, I just taped it.  My old one just went to Netflix.  It's amazing how many people see it on Netflix.  That's where I want...  That's exactly...  Epics is great, because they're fun to work with, and they fucking do a good job, and  then it goes to Netflix.  That's all it's going to be.  Man, so much more than when it was on Comedy Central.  Yeah.  People just...  It just got posted up there a couple weeks ago.  It's like it came out all over again.  Oh, that's exciting.  Yeah.  Tom Popper on Twitter.  The E.P.O.P.N.F.  Continues in moments. 
[01:01:30]  I like this part of Dylan.  When you can understand him.  Too bad Ant's not here today.  He hates Dylan.  Drives him nuts.  I hate Dylan.  I love Dylan.  God. 
[01:02:00]  Because he's not listening to the words.  He's got to listen to the words, man.  You're not getting the meaning of it.  I guess 44 years ago, Nashville Skyline was released by Bob Dylan.  What was the big song on that?  I would assume this one, right?  Yeah.  Thank you, E-Rock.  That's wonderful.  Tom Popper's studio.  We were talking about Annette Funicello and I forgot to play the Britney Spears thing.  She's just an idiot.  It's really funny.  She didn't know what she was saying.  What did she say? 
[01:02:30]  She said this.  Hey, Britney, what do you think about the passing of Annette Funicello?  Fellow Mouseketeer.  I think that's great.  I think that's great.  I think that's great.  What a fucking idiot.  She just has her, like, you know, predisposed answer, trying to make sure everything stays  positive without even processing what question we just had.  She couldn't even process the question?  No.  Hey, Britney, what do you think about the passing of Annette Funicello? 
[01:03:00]  Fellow Mouseketeer.  I think that's great.  I think that's great.  It's great.  I think that's great.  Wouldn't it be great if she did actually know the question?  If I said, you know, we were talking about her passing and she's like, oh, yeah, no,  I know.  I heard it.  I just thought she was a cunt.  Good riddance.  They didn't like Margaret Thatcher because they're basically calling her a...  They're happy she's dead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got signs saying the bitch is dead or something like that. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, they were walking around with signs that said the bitch is dead.  Yeah.  Any of the old unions in England.  They weren't big fans, right?  The lady does not turn.  I don't know if I'm happy or sad.  I don't really care.  I don't care either.  That's a good tie in the lay lady, lay with the two dead ladies.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Very good.  We try to stake some shit together here, Tom Papa.  It took me a while to catch it.  We got Paul Anker coming in today, too.  That is cool.  Legend.  He is a legend.  Legend.  Show business legend. 
[01:04:00]  Is he a tough guy?  I mean, we've all heard the tapes, but is he going to be cool or is he going to be ornery?  What kind of guy do you think we're going to be?  I've been going to be fantastic.  Yeah.  You think he's going to be all showbiz?  He'll have great stories.  He knows...  He's promoting.  He knows all about old Vegas.  And that's what I'm interested in.  I wish I would have read the book because there's probably so many great moments in here.  I'm such an...  Maybe we could have Sal or somebody look up the highlights.  I wish I had read more.  Whoever it is.  Poor choice.  Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Elvis. 
[01:04:30]  He knew everybody and he knows everybody.  And he also remembers Vegas in the 60s.  And I'm interested to hear about Vegas then and also when Vegas was considered schmaltzy.  Like Vegas in the late 60s became like a schmaltzy, unhip kind of douchey.  Like when the British invasion happened.  Right.  So I'm curious as to how guys like this survived because...  Yeah, that's a weird time.  Sinatra survived because he was famous since the fucking 40s.  Like Sinatra survived all of these things.  But there were times where he wasn't considered hip at all. 
[01:05:00]  Like I'm really interested in that stuff.  Yeah.  Let me see.  Those are the highlights, he says.  Those are the highlights.  Okay.  What do you mean those are the highlights?  God, you know, Jimmy, he might beat you with celebrity photos.  Might beat me?  He's got all four Beatles together.  He's got the Beatles together.  He's got Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan.  He's got Muhammad Ali.  But you have a Muhammad Ali.  But you don't have Muhammad Ali in his prime.  Or Sinatra.  He's got a Frank Sinatra.  He's got...  Look at all his daughters.  He's got four daughters.  That's great. 
[01:05:30]  He's got Barbara Walters.  Michael Jackson.  Cookie Monster.  Cookie Monster.  Pushing over a two-year-old.  SpongeBob.  He got in that picture.  Michael Bublé.  I'm not a fan of Michael Bublé.  Michael Bublé.  All right.  So...  Yeah, this is hard.  I mean, he was one of those guys that...  He had this talent, but also this incredible hustle.  You know?  Yeah.  Oh, so you know a little bit about Paul Ecker?  A little, little bit. 
[01:06:00]  Wow.  All right.  Here's a story I didn't know.  What?  Johnny Carson was obsessed with Sinatra.  I was watching Rat Pack stuff last night.  I was watching a very rare thing from 65 in St. Louis where Carson stood in for Joey Bishop,  who was sick, and was doing some stand-up.  Right.  It might have been 67, but he had the Tonight Show already.  Uh-huh.  And he was killing, and then Dean Martin and Sammy and Sinatra were all on that.  But apparently Anka said Johnny was a drunk obsessed with Sinatra. 
[01:06:30]  And he would hang out on Jilly's Saloon on 52nd Street, hoping to connect to Sinatra,  but Sinatra never paid attention to him.  And then one night, a drunk Carson started pinching the asses of a couple of girls at  the bar.  Unfortunately, there were side dishes, like girlfriends of mobsters, and their boyfriends  threw Johnny down the steps, and when he landed, they started kicking him.  Wow.  Wow.  Really?  Side dishes.  I like that term.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I, uh, I was just, uh, I was just, uh, waiting for Frank. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  I, uh, I, uh.  Who's that supposed to be?  I'm trying to find Carson.  Wow.  I, uh, I did not know they were side dishes.  Oh, my God.  You sound like just an anonymous deaf person.  He also wrote, uh, Times of Your Life.  Okay.  You know that song, right?  Sure.  The Kodak commercial.  Oh, right.  Do you remember the times of your life? 
[01:07:30]  I sing that a lot, actually.  Was it written for the Kodak commercial?  Do you remember the times of your life?  Originally a commercial jingle, but then became a number one song back in 1973.  Paul Anka.  That's a great song.  Paul Anka has recorded 125 albums.  Get out.  125 albums?  Wow.  Man, oh, man.  I'd like to hear the 120th. 
[01:08:00]  I bet you the 120th was a doozy.  Probably came back strong, but the 120th, I don't know.  What's on the 120th album?  How many of those are best ofs?  Yeah.  And then the best of the best ofs.  I hate when bands do that.  God damn it.  I wish I'd read this whole book.  Oh, shucks.  Ah, jeepers.  Why?  We got all the good stuff.  I know.  We got all the good stuff right in front of us.  We got the Cliff Notes.  That's all you need.  Yeah.  Why read the book?  You think Colbert reads the book every time these guys come on? 
[01:08:30]  No way.  Nah.  Nah.  What other songs did Paul Anka record, though?  We only know a few.  I thought he did Bad Blood, but that's wrong.  Neil Sedaka.  Bad, bad.  He wrote Lonely Boy.  Blood, blood.  It was about his mother, yeah.  She died of liver disease.  Give me Lonely Boy.  He wrote Lonely Boy.  Lonely Boy.  He wrote My Way, but his version I don't think was...  Well.  Certainly wasn't as popular as Sinatra's.  No, but he wrote it.  He wrote this one, too. 
[01:09:00]  Paul Anka, Lonely Boy.  Lonely Boy.  Lonely and blue.  Nah, I don't know this one.  I'm all alone.  I know another Lonely Boy song.  What's the other version?  There's another Lonely Boy song.  He gave fucking My Way to Sinatra for free.  No.  Ouch.  He loved Sinatra, though.  Wow.  Yeah, but you don't...  You could have been rich just off of that.  But maybe Frank Sinatra should have said,  Hey, man, here's some pocket money.  Thanks.  Frank probably did a lot of stuff for him, though.  I mean, I think Sinatra was nice to him. 
[01:09:30]  You can't give away My Way for free.  I'm giving you a side dish.  That's what I'm doing for you.  We got to ask him about that.  Because you don't...  I would assume if you're a songwriter,  you know when you got one.  Where you're like,  Holy fuck, this is it.  And you just hand it to Frank Sinatra.  I don't know.  Maybe he wasn't going anywhere.  I think there's a story there.  You're right, though.  Maybe it wasn't.  Maybe it just was...  Like you try to do something with this.  Yeah, good luck to you.  What's his version?  Do we have Paul Anka's version of My Way?  And now, time is near. 
[01:10:00]  Yada, da, da, da, da.  Much difference.  Very fast.  I don't think I've ever heard Paul Anka's version of My Way.  You got that?  B-Rock.  The one I have here is him and Sinatra together.  Nah, come on.  I was watching...  Again, looking at Sammy Davis Jr.  Did I say this on the air or off?  Off.  The Sammy videos online,  watching him sing Candyman  and how great he was live.  Yeah.  He was just a smooth fucking dude.  Yeah.  And then they had those little blurbs  of information on these videos 
[01:10:30]  and they were talking about...  Sinatra really loved Sammy Davis Jr.  He loved him.  Yeah.  And when Sammy was in the back of a limo  asleep and had a car accident,  that's how he lost his left eye  and how he recovered at Frank's play  at a broken jaw.  Right.  That's how he lost his eye?  Yeah, it was a car accident.  And he recovered at one of Sinatra's places.  What, did he have his head out the window?  No, he was asleep in the back seat.  Whee!  Why did I answer that literally?  I was going for a little joke there.  I know I gave you a serious answer.  No, no, no.  Take the back room. 
[01:11:00]  Cure that eye.  And he, uh...  That was a good Piscopo.  And he, uh...  And he said that Sinatra encouraged him  and said,  you're going to be even more famous.  This is like 1954.  And he was.  I mean, uh, Sinatra...  It makes me like Sinatra more  the way he took care of Sammy Davis.  Why?  You didn't like him before?  I never cared about him before.  He's the coolest.  I don't like his music.  I think it's terrible.  What's wrong with you?  I just don't enjoy anything.  Let's Paul Lincoln do it, by the way.  You want to be a lady?  Can you turn that to him so I can watch  and enjoy it at home? 
[01:11:30]  The end is near  And so I face  The bells of the bell  I'm going to do it without the bells.  That's probably what's the difference.  My friend  I'll say it clear  It's a great song.  Yeah.  State my case  Some of which I'm certain  Do you know who introduced him here?  I think a comedian named David Steinberg.  Oh, yeah?  I watched this video the other day.  Oh, wow. 
[01:12:00]  Steinberg's still around.  Yeah.  Let's just get to the hug.  You gotta put more pep in it.  Much more than this  I did it  My  Regrets  I've had a few  But then again  Too few to mention  Just give it to me.  It's a sleeper. 
[01:12:30]  No one's gonna hear it.  I did  What I had to do  And I saw it through  Without exemption  Can we see the beginning of the video?  I want to see  This is the one I watched  Where Steinberg  I want to see  It's time to talk  If it's David Steinberg  Just go to the very beginning  There's nothing wrong with that version.  Oh, yeah.  It is Steinberg.  Look at that.  And what is he doing?  Frank Sinatra recorded it  Made it into a big hit  In fact  Paul Anka has been referred to 
[01:13:00]  By some  As a young Frank Sinatra  Which must do wonders  For Frank Sinatra Jr.'s morale  Here is the multi-talented Paul Anka  To sing a song of his own composition  My way  That's kind of cool  By the way, we've been cancelled  He missed that  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's okay  I didn't  Could we go ahead a little bit?  I thought he was done  No, of course  To sing a song 
[01:13:30]  Of his own composition  My way  By the way  Have you heard  Our show's been cancelled?  Who cares?  That's how he throws  The fucking  And can sing  Who my way  That's great  Who cares?  That's awesome  Alright, so he's coming around  9, 9.30, right?  Paul Anka  They just showed  Jezelnik on  The Tonight Show  I don't know  I miss  That son of a bitch  Looks good on TV  He is a  I didn't realize 
[01:14:00]  How fucking handsome  That cocksucker is  Until he walks around  He's got squid legs  Does he really?  Yeah  Thank God  Because he's a fucking  I'm watching him on TV  I'm like, I get it  Like, why they want him  On television  Right  Because he's a funny dude  But I mean, he looks  Really good on TV  I'm not saying that  In a mo-ish way  You are  No, I'm not  I saw the same thing  When I saw Whitney Cummings  Like, when I was watching  Her on a monitor  I'm like, I see why people  Like, really want her  To be on TV  Because she looks great  Right  Better than I would  Blinking and fucking twitching  Oh, no  You look delightful  On the television  I just, I, yeah  Pick me out of the doldrums 
[01:14:30]  And of course  Before we move on  From Paul Anka  We gotta ask him  About the tapes  The tapes  Has he talked about  The tapes?  Classic tapes  Has he talked about  The tapes?  I've never heard him  Talk about the tapes  I've heard the tapes  You thought  You thought  Eight things tonight  You're on fucking notice  John  I gave you a list  That half a list  That I gave you  Was choosing everything on it  Okay  The guys get shirts  Don't make a fucking  Maniac out of me  The guys get shirts 
[01:15:00]  Do you understand?  We're not gonna be as strong  As our weakest link  The guys get shirts  Damn  Fuck  He did explain it  On NPR  He did?  Oh, God  But it's NPR  You listen to NPR ever?  Took a couple hours  It's so fucking boring  So, when you had those tapes  And you decided that you were  It sounds like you're really  Just trying to take control  Of the band  Successful, though 
[01:15:30]  I don't know why  What, we're gonna play  Jezzelneck now  On the Tonight Show?  Why was he on IMAS?  Did he say something  Controversial?  Uh, that's a very good question  Why would I misplay that?  Oh, yeah  I was just wondering  What he said on  Yeah, why is I misplay that clip?  Was it naughty?  No, I have no idea  Oh, I don't  You know  I was right here  Now, what's going on  With this accidental racist song?  I really am out on this one  Oh, God  Completely  I know it was trending yesterday  Yeah, some people are saying  It's controversial  But it's really just 
[01:16:00]  One of the worst songs  Ever written  Really?  It's just such a bad song  It's Brad Paisley  Right  And you have to hang in  For the whole song  No  Because the last verse  Right  Is LL Cool J  Right  Oh, that's why he was trending  Dude, it is so bad  Who's Brad Paisley?  He's a country artist  Country dude  His album's getting shit reviews  I saw it in the paper today  I want to hear a little bit  This Cool J is really cool  Cool J?  I like his rapping  You do?  I'm a radio 
[01:16:30]  That's just weird to hear  I'm gonna punch you out  It's just weird to hear  Cool J without the LL part  It's so strange to me  Mama Said Knock You Out  I always hated  But then again  I always hated  Getting Jiggy With It  By Will Smith  There's certain rap songs  That become popular  With white people  I don't mind them  I hate them  They're catchy  I like him  I don't like that song  They're kind of catchy  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba  Right  I bet Anka don't like it  This is Accidental Racist  Brad Paisley's new horrible song 
[01:17:00]  Featuring LL Cool J  Got some soul, Paul  Cool J  Wait, this is gonna turn into some rap shit  By the end  LL has a verse on it  Yeah  But really late  Yeah, at the end of the song  Can we just go to that part?  Slow get into  This is a long song  It's a really long song  It's almost six minutes long  To the man that waited on me 
[01:17:30]  Had the Starbucks down on me  Keep it  No  It's like smelling your own fart  Let it go  Oh my god  What did he say?  I missed that  I was reading the part  Starbucks  Do it again  You didn't hear this?  No  I don't know shit about writing music  But I know this much  You should never write about Starbucks  Oh, filter your thoughts  Oh my god  Listen to this, Jimmy  Alright, hold on 
[01:18:00]  It's a relatable story  We all go to Starbucks, right?  This is the best  Oh my god  You don't reference Starbucks ever  Especially first lyric  Listen, Jimmy  Listen  What was the first part?  To the man that waited on me  To the man that waited on me  At the Starbucks down on me 
[01:18:30]  Oh my god  Are you kidding me?  You're so literal  It's fucking beautiful  There's multiple Starbucks  You guys are fucking crazy  That's beautiful  To the man that waited on me  Fuck yeah  I got this coffee  You fucking cocksucker  Oh my god  Oh, let me hear it  The fucking song is beautiful  I gotta hear that again  Let it go  We might have to listen  To this whole fucking song  We have to  Oh, I miss Patrice O'Neal  He used to break down 
[01:19:00]  These fucking songs  For us  There are a lot of Starbucks  In the area  He's talking about the one on Main  I've been to that one  You know, there's a lot of things  You could write about, right?  Ugh  Why would you ever write about  Your trip to Starbucks?  It's just so lazy  Holy  He's taking it somewhere  That's gonna give us all a pause  Alright  Let's find out  You're right  Pause  What are we, cats?  Fucking comic relief  When? 
[01:19:30]  That was it  I don't know  To the man that waited on me  The Starbucks down on me  I hope you understand  When I put on that t-shirt  The only thing I meant to say 
[01:20:00]  Is I'm a Skinnerd fan  What the fuck is going on?  I know what's happening  I do too  It's a black guy working at Starbucks  And he thinks that his Skinnerd shirt is racist  It's probably a flag  It's probably a southern flag  Yeah, the stars in bars  And this  Oh my  This self-important douchebag  This groveling guilty white hillbilly  Oh my god  This fucking groveling hick  Put on a fucking 
[01:20:30]  A Dixie flag shot  I'm guessing  Right  And the black guy said  That's racist  Instead of just going  Shut up  I like the band  He wrote a song  Right  I bet he played it to the guy  You inspired this  And they said  He's been fired for thievery  I bet it's more  Cowardly  I bet the guy didn't even say anything  He just had this uncomfortable kind of look  Maybe you're right  And he's just like  Ugh  Trying to act all ballsy  By wearing a Skinnerd shirt  But he doesn't have it in him  Yeah, but he didn't mean to offend the guy  This is fucking beautiful 
[01:21:00]  You guys are so harsh  Oh, what's his name?  Where are we at?  He's got a Skinnerd shirt on  Well, the thing is  He went to Starbucks  And the Starbucks guy is black  No  Starbucks on Main  Yeah, but is he a black guy?  They don't say nothing yet  Right  Alright  It's important  It's just somehow  It's like the elephant  In the corner of the south  An elephant  An elephant in the corner of the south  This guy's a poet  Yeah, he's talking about  Like the elephant in the south  And wait  They got elephants 
[01:21:30]  And he's down south, right?  With his t-shirt  Of course  You can't go a mile without  Because you might put it on  Or something  And say  Get me my coffee, boy  And he's always like  What the fuck?  That doesn't make no sense  Well, you guys thought  He was being too literal  So he brought up  The elephant in the south  Oh, beautiful  It's lazy songwriting, P.D.  What happened next?  Are we all going to learn  By the end of this song?  I hope the wardrobe goes  He's wearing a Skinnerd t-shirt  With a confederate flag on it  Right  Right  You have a multi-millionaire 
[01:22:00]  Coming out of his tour bus  In a Skinnerd shirt  Right  Thinking I'm all cool  And then he realizes  I can't read  Because he doesn't see  Leonard Skinnerd on the shirt  I like how they make  The guy at Starbucks  Is now the new shoeshine guy  Exactly  It's a Leonard Skinner shirt  Wouldn't say Leonard Skinnerd  Not just  Just a proud rebel son  With an old can of worms  Looking like I got a lot to learn 
[01:22:30]  Poison  Fucking be with going fishing  Fucking can of worms  With a bitch going fishing or something  No  With an elephant  With an elephant  Yeah he's going to go fishing for elephants  Poor guy  That fucking black cocksucker  Embarrassed him  Chips  He's not being literal anymore  Fucking shit  He's not  The black guy  Yeah  With a fish with his elephant  They would always do that to me too  They'd be like 
[01:23:00]  Yo  There's a lot of fucking guilt  In this song huh  Oh yeah  It's hard being white in the south  All over a latte  Wow  Oh yeah  This guy might want to make his own coffee  He can't handle  Going to Starbucks  God  We've only started  And already we've got  A Starbucks is our anchor  And a pink elephant  And can of worms  Bad cliches  In the other two lines  I bet I know what he's going to say next  And then I looked at you  And ate some strange fruit 
[01:23:30]  Little Billie Holiday  He goes no  This is great  I kind of like it now  Yeah we do have to play the whole thing  I thought this was a throwaway  Fucking song is amazing  I thought we'd hear a little LL Cool Jing  Alright whatever  Good for you  But this is fucking horrible songwriting  Beautiful  Bad songwriting Petey  And also showing that Brad Paisley  Is completely out of touch  Right  But from my point of view 
[01:24:00]  I'm just a white man  Coming to you from the south land  Trying to understand  What it's like not to be  I'm proud of the way  The south land  Right  Trying to figure out  What it's like not to be  A white guy  What?  He's trying to learn  Different cultures  Stop overthinking everything  No you don't get it 
[01:24:30]  Get your stupid coffee  And get on the tour bus  You're not as intellectual as Brad Paisley  And get back to your candy crush game  He's just now realizing  There are other people  Who aren't white  Right  There are blacks and Hispanics  He had no idea  He finally realized that  As an adult male  Because none of them  Buy his shitty records  That's why  None of them go to his shows  You're right  I thought someone threw dirt on you  And someone said  No no  That color  He looks down that sea of people 
[01:25:00]  Watching him  And that one black face  Not one black face  And they took him  To go into a Starbucks  To realize  Hey  What's that kind of  He's an interesting looking feller  So this idiot is trying to get  Some color in his audience  Yeah  He's explaining  Holy fuck  The reason that he put out this song  Is because  His quote is that  Art  Should promote  And congratulations  Art  Art  Should promote  Discussion  Yes it should  That's what Brad Paisley looks like  Let me see 
[01:25:30]  And then he got LL Cool J  To buy in  The only guy that would do it  Oh man  With this fucking  These two fucking  These two drips  And you know  They put these  Self-congratulating drips  Really thought they  Hit an emotional home run  And you think  When he wrote the song  He was hoping to get like  Jay-Z  Or Kanye West  Absolutely  To get on it  And all he could get  Was a white guy  To rap on it  And this is the publicity  Photo with LL Cool J  He's not even wearing  The Leonard Skinner shirt  No  That inspired the song 
[01:26:00]  Why wouldn't you wear  The Leonard Skinner shirt  Exactly  He's got a picture of  Malcolm X  On his fucking shirt  Brad Paisley  What is he wearing  What is his shirt  I don't even understand  LL is slightly lighter  Than Brad Paisley  Yeah  I'm no kidding  He found a safe  Black guy  Wow  He should have  Went real black  Back to the song  Fuck yeah  We got four minutes  To go by the way  Thank god  And by the way  If you like songwriting  I do  I love songwriting  You like lyrics  Love it  Who let the dogs out  One of my favorites  Just wait till you get 
[01:26:30]  To LL's rap  You will not  Be disappointed  That guy  That guy can rap  His butt off  My mother would always say  Right  She'll always look at him  Without his shirt  And go look at that chipper  What  Okay back to the song  I'm proud of where I'm from  But not everything we've done  And it ain't like you and me  Can rewrite history  Our generation 
[01:27:00]  Not everything we've done is bad  Didn't start this nation  We're still picking up the pieces  Walking on eggshells  Fighting over yesterday  Call  Well then why are you wearing the shirt?  Stop walking on eggshells then  And write a song that isn't groveling  Pink elephant walking on eggshells  I don't mind that if he's trying  But he's groveling  And he's walking on eggshells  And he's mentioning  I'm walking on eggshells  Why wouldn't you just say  Look I love Leonard Skinner 
[01:27:30]  Deal with it  Right exactly  End of my Starbucks experience  Have you heard  Give me back my bullets  It's a great fucking band  I love being ballsy  Wearing your thing  As you're ordering  A grande soy latte  Right  In the whitest place in America  Starbucks  If you want to get something done  Don't look at my shirt  Go to world star hip hop  And look how your people  Are treating each other  Oh Brad  I love southern Jimmy 
[01:28:00]  Walking on eggshells  Pink elephant  Can of worms  I bet he works in a diner  Because his eggshell's on the floor  Give me back my bullets  We're playing that into break  You know that right  Iraq  Are we on the same fucking page today  Or what  Meta for what  I think that might be  Ronnie B's favorite Skinner song too  I don't like your meta bullets  I'm in good company  You don't like giving back my bullets  No I like  Am I Losing  And I like  Freebird  You're a Freebird guy 
[01:28:30]  Oh Simpleman's nice  Sitting on Tuesday's Gone  Is really good  And it is Tuesday  Look at you casually  Bringing up all your  Skinnered now  I think Simpleman is the best  Da da da  The opening  That song is one of the best openings  To a song ever  Let me hear the open to Simpleman  It's just great  Let me hear  You  What about Brad Paisley's song  Yeah we're going back to it  It's going to have another run  And with another guy  He was probably darker  Than the first  Simpleton is looking up  Simpleman  Oh boy  He works twice  Because he's a simpleton 
[01:29:00]  And he weighs a ton  Oh yeah  This is just  Simpleman  How good is this  That's good man  It's going to be  Leonard Skinner day  Fuck it  I don't mean on the radio  When I get out of here  Mad bones  This Van Zandka  Really fucking  Built out a song  You like this Sam? 
[01:29:30]  I like this song  Yeah  He had a great voice  Oh fuck  Yeah  Was Anka in Skinner?  He was like this song  Who's up beside me  My only son  Last thing this great voice said was  Ah!  What I'll say  If you do this  You're walking on eggshells 
[01:30:00]  Alright  We'll get back to  Simpleman  I know  It's good stuff  Let's get back to  Real songwriting  Alright  Back to the Starbucks  It is complex  He's ruining it for everybody  It is really complex  Now everyone is going to have to  Deal with this issue now  In the south  Boy  He's proud of where he's from 
[01:30:30]  Because we're going to finally  Have to deal with this issue  Because of Brad Paisley  2013  He's 40  He found out there's like  Hispanic people  Black people  Where the fuck did this guy live  For 40 years?  Exactly  Because I want to move there  Finally figure out this  More people than just white people  Quickly meets an Asian person  His mind  Oh he's going to fucking blow  Oh he's going to fucking flip shit  And I thought you had a pinky  Sticking out of the front of your body  He's going to be amazed by Asian people 
[01:31:00]  Yeah dude  He realizes that they're not just  They're not tired  That's just how they look  Yeah  They just have magical eyes  Right  Wow  They called it reconstruction  Fixed the buildings  Dried some tears  We're still sifting through the road  After 150 years  I tried to put myself in your shoes 
[01:31:30]  And that's a good place to begin  It ain't like I can walk a mile  On someone else's skin  Cause I'm a white man  Living in the Southland  Just like you  I'm more than one  See  I'm proud  He did to do the right thing  Of taking a really complex subject  And putting it to a very catchy tune  That makes it just drive 
[01:32:00]  Do you know what he is?  He's a maudlin drip  He really is  A real bummer  Just a drip  Even the song title  Accidental racist  Oh exactly  Literal dunce  Literal dunce  All cliches  Oh he's fucking hideous  I don't know where I'm from  Not everything we've done  And it ain't like you  I see all the white arms  Of the concert 
[01:32:30]  Going back and forth  History  Our generation  Didn't start this nation  We're still paying for the mistakes  That a bunch of folks made  Long before we came  And caught some wind  Sounds like he's groveling a little bit  We're not the same white people  That built the nation  Justin Stengel just texted me  A good point  Yeah what did he say?  When he meets a midget  He's just going to give up  And go home 
[01:33:00]  Oh he's going to be like  What the fuck?  Your phone groan?  Holy shit  That's as big as you get?  Yeah that's impossible  How are your limbs that stubby?  Take me to your land  I saw a little man  Who lost his legs in the war  No  Born that way  No he's born that way  His head is the same size as mine  But his body is so sweaty  And you're trying to tell me  He thinks the same way I do?  Not possible  Holy fuck  He lives in a little house  Just like me 
[01:33:30]  So we're not supposed to use these things  To go bowling?  I picked him up and kissed his cheek  Wow what a closed minded  Douche this guy is  I thought he was a baby with a goatee  That's hilarious  Well I grew up in a pretty white neighborhood  But by the time I was 10  I realized there were black people  Absolutely  I know  What the fuck  He's 40  He didn't even have a TV  Man  Odds on wind  Between southern pride 
[01:34:00]  And southern blame  Are we still  Remember  And you notice he put LL Cool J  To the back of the song  I was just going to say  We have that coming up  Okay you got that joke  Yeah  I'm trying to fucking write it in my head  But he doesn't even believe  Even though he's learning about black people  He still doesn't believe  They should be up front in his music  He's a throwaway  At the end of the song  We're still waiting for LL 
[01:34:30]  To pop into this dumb thing  He can come on once I'm done  My song has a token black  Guy  He's the only one that would do it  We're running out of fucking time  On this song  And we're four minutes in  With no sign of LL  Exactly  But I have a feeling  It's coming soon now  Oh it is  And by the way  We should definitely  Go line by line for LL  Really  We're going to analyze what he's saying  It's very good  It is  Alright  Line by line though  Yeah  That could be a thousand words in a minute 
[01:35:00]  Dear Mr. White Man  Oh it's right here  Dear Mr. White Man  Oh it does not disappoint  Right out of the blocks  Dear Mr. White Man  That's right  LL just found out there's white people  There's literally  I couldn't have guessed that  In a thousand years  That that's how he would start  Yeah  Even if the guy's name was White Man  I would never address someone  As Dear Mr. White Man  I don't know much about country music 
[01:35:30]  I've got to be honest with you  There's a guy on the line  Let him say it  This can't be true  Richard in Texas  Richard  Yeah I just wanted to know  What y'all expected  From a guy who wrote such hits  Like  I'm gonna check you for ticks  You never heard that song?  There's a song called  I'm gonna check you for ticks  Yeah but it was about Tourette's  I think it is  Huh?  I wanna check you for ticks  No no stop this song  Cause that's gonna be  A whole nother fucking trip for us  Yeah  You gotta hit the  It was a big country hit 
[01:36:00]  It was it was huge  This song  I'm gonna check you for ticks  Maybe I heard it then  Gigantic  Alright we're gonna play that next  Richard thank you  Alright bye  Wow this guy's a hack  Yeah  But I mean he has sold some records  I know that much  Oh but that whole genre  Is just cliche and cliche  And literal dripping  The videos are hilarious  If it's  If it's  I walk  He'd come into the Starbucks  The guy would have a tears  He's making a latte  I mean  This guy's good  This guy's a treat 
[01:36:30]  You guys ready for L Cool J?  Yeah  Dear Mr. White Man  Dear Mr. White Man  I wish you understood  What the world is really like  When you're living in the hood  Just because my pants are high  That's one of the most racist things I've heard  No that's a really good rap in 1983  Yeah  That's a really good rap in 83  And 83 was the last time LL lived anywhere near the hood  No yeah  I wish you understood 
[01:37:00]  What it's like to live in the hood  You understood LL  You got the fuck out  Yeah  What are you talking about?  He raps like a guy in a fucking prison documentary  Who's showing you what he's gonna do when he gets out  Like they'll show some guy who's convicted of raping an old lady with a cheerleading baton  And then he's fucking rapping in his cell  And they show it just to be fucking comical  Great  Grandma's rapping have more cred than this  Oh yeah  This makes somebody's dad like reading rap lyrics  Man  You like when you're living in the hood 
[01:37:30]  Just because my pants are sagging  Doesn't mean I'm up to no good  You should try to get to know me  I really wish you would  Now my chance is gone  But I'm still misunderstood  No  This guy's fucking good man  These raps are good  You should try to get to know me  I really wish you would  I wish you would  Like these guys  Like real black guys are longing to be embraced by the country rap scene  When you look at the way rap was  Like this type of stuff  Yeah  Fucking  Big Daddy Kane changed this 
[01:38:00]  Made this style of rap seem irrelevant  And what year was he out  I'm gonna guess  A long fucking time ago  87 or 90  Yeah  He's an 80s guy right  He's in the building this week by the way  I'm so psyched  You gotta meet him  Or have you met him before  I've never met him  He's one of your guys right  Love him yeah  But I mean like  Guys like that changed this fucking  The cadence of this stuff  Didn't seem fresh  Or Eric B and Rakim  Like this type of rap was  Was done in like the mid 80s  Of course it was  This is only done now  Like when you have  At weddings 
[01:38:30]  At white weddings  And you have the  Bachelor party  Yeah like this one  Should have started with  Well my name is  Right  Does he say whack  At any point in this rap  I'm gonna find out  I'd love to hear him say whack  I do like though  That he's addressing it to  Mr. White Man  The non-specific  Representative of the community  Right  Not one person  But everyone  You have two guys here  Completely out of touch  Completely  Just not living the lives 
[01:39:00]  And the other thing is like  Well hold on  Hold on  Cause we gotta add this  To the discussion  Self-cutting girl on Twitter  She's asking  Don't we know  This song is a joke  If you listen to any of  Brad's past music  You get the joke  It's not a joke  He just said  I mean every article  He's talking about it  Trying to promote discussion  It's not a joke  It's not a joke  There's no punchline here  There isn't a  I listened to the whole song  It's not a punchline  The joke's on you sister  Hmm  The other thing is like 
[01:39:30]  You give LL Cool J  LL Cool J  Is not gonna be part of a joke  When you're talking about race  Not voluntarily anyway  LL don't play that way  But you give him like  You're like  You have a verse  Yeah  To discuss race  In the United States  And he's just filling it  With empty syllables  Like  We should get to know each other  I really wish you would  It's saying  Absolutely nothing  Right  Exactly  It's safe  It's fucking terrible  It's safe  It's safe 
[01:40:00]  He raps like the DJ  From Houdini  For anybody that remembers  How awful it was  When he rapped  Cause it is  Fresh  It's like a linebacker  Just saying things  Just saying things  Yo Sway  Sway has arrived  Let's bring Sway in  Yo Sway  I don't know if he's got time  Will he come in  He comes in  For his 8 o'clock show  At 8.05  Yeah well  What a fucking life that is  Yo Sway  Does he have a minute  Ah he's going on 
[01:40:30]  He's going on  Okay  Alright  Brad Paisley song  With LL  Are you talking about  The Brad Paisley song today  I got going in  Ah  He hasn't heard this job  He hasn't heard it  He hasn't heard it  Okay  I haven't heard it though  We're boys off the air  But he's making it look like  We're not boys off the air  He's got a job  I'll just come back a little later  Alright  We're boys off the air  You've seen the action right  It's hard in the hood  You've seen the hugs and stuff  With me and Sway right  Yeah they're tight  They're tight  Alright back to LL 
[01:41:00]  In the hood  Just because my pants are sagging  Doesn't mean I'm up to no good  You should try to get to know me  I really wish you would  Now my chains are gold  But I'm still misunderstood  Now my chains are golden  Anyone else pick up on that?  You see what that means?  The reference  Chains  To slavery  Yeah that's the first  But I'm still misunderstood  No one misunderstands you LL  You couldn't be  More literal  You couldn't be whiter  And easy to understand  He said fuck it  I'm just gonna join the white world 
[01:41:30]  Right  He hosts the Grammys  And acts on CSI  Right  You couldn't get more white than that  Everyone loves you  America accepted you  They said host the Grammys  He's Chris O'Donnell's co-star  Chris O'Donnell  The whitest man in America  Yeah  Wow  Now my chains are gold  But I'm still misunderstood  I wasn't there when Sherman's march  Turned the south into firewood  I want you to get paid  Or be a slave  I never could  Feel like a newfangled jangled 
[01:42:00]  Dodged in invisible white hoods  So when I see that white cowboy hat  I'm thinking it's not all good  I guess we're both guilty  Of judging the cover  Not the book  I'd love to buy you a beer  The cover not the book  I'll judge the book  Because the book is called Drek  And these song lyrics  It's Drek  They have like a giant book of cliches  That they just pull out  Like a magical thesaurus  Technically it's not a cliche  Because he said 
[01:42:30]  Judging the cover  Not the book  And the cliche is  You know  You put the book before the cover  You're right  Right  Don't judge a book by its cover  Yeah but he's still using a cliche  He's still using a cliche  You think it still counts  Yeah  A little bit  Eggshell walking  Is the same thing  Walking on eggshells  That's Christopher's brother  And someone's telling me  LL Cool J  Was brought up in Bayshore  Long Island  That's not Compton  It's not even close to Compton  LL is from Queens  He's a Queens guy 
[01:43:00]  He's from Jamaica Queens  Unless he was  Someone said Bayshore too  He was  Okay maybe  He did a little time  In Jamaica Queens  And then they moved him to Bayshore  To get him out of the hood early on  Oh maybe  Wow  I don't think he had it that tough  The cover before the book  Oh wow  Wow  Stupid  This is just dumb  This is terrible  He wants to buy the white guy a beer 
[01:43:30]  Yeah he does  No he doesn't  He wants to buy him in Old English  Yeah  I want to buy you a 40 ounce  And put it in a bag  That's a better rap  Than anything that's been on here so far  Yeah  Do you want me to read you  In case anyone thinks  This is a joke song  Sure  Brad Paisley's tweets  Yes  So as you buy this album  I hope it triggers emotions  I hope you feel a joy  Heartache  Triumph  Surprise  You laugh  Cry  Nudge someone beside you 
[01:44:00]  Oh no  It's not going to happen  Ew  None of those things  Are going to happen  You nudge somebody  By you on the train  And you go  Could you get up sir  There's a white man  That needs to sit down  You know the rules  I hope the album rocks you  Soothes you  Raises questions  Answers  Evokes feeling  All the way through  This is like an introductory kit  To race relations  Right  Yeah  None of this stuff's going to happen  For white people  Who've never thought of  White people before  What he should say  Is I hope this album 
[01:44:30]  Bores you  And makes you uncomfortable  That would have been  Very very  None of this shit's  Going to happen  Wow  None of it  Talk about  And nudge somebody  Why would you nudge anyone  I don't know  Jimmy I don't know  Guess what I don't want  To talk  Hey you hear what  He just said  About blacks  Hey you  I'm relating  Young thug  With the red headphones  Take that off  We talk to you  About race relations  Oh my god  You don't think  There's a scenario  With a black guy  And a white guy  Listening to this together  And then  One nudges the other 
[01:45:00]  And goes  You know  He's right  Yes  Here's the scenario  The white guy  Is listening to this  On his iPod  The black fist  Crashes into his face  Steals the iPod  And then puts it on  And listens to this  And nudges his friend  And goes  Yo listen to this  Shit  That's the scenario  This is fucking hideous  I can't wait  For the video  By the way  Someone pointed out  On Twitter  And I noticed it  And didn't say  LL said conversate  Which again  Nobody says that  In rap anymore  Right  I'm gonna conversate  Like it's 1990 son 
[01:45:30]  Someone got it wrong  Obviously it was  Bayside Queens  I remember that  Yeah  Bayside  Yeah not Bayshore  Bayside Queens  I don't think that's  Wow  As tough as Compton  God  The go to  Hood  Compton  If you don't judge  My do rag  I won't judge  Your red flag  Wait wait wait  If you don't judge  My rap  I won't judge  Your red flag  Nice if you don't judge  My do rag  If you don't judge  My do rag

[01:46:30]  What it's like  You see how he  Uncomfortably  Had to try to get  His words in there  Of course  And what a statement  If you don't judge  What I'm wearing  Then I'm cool  With your  Right  Flag that represents  Killing all my  Grandparents  Yeah  Yeah  Like  I don't think  The do rag  Ever represents  Everything that  The confederacy did  But luckily it rhymes  Yeah  Right  If you don't judge

[01:56:30]  Yeah  This all ends with  You know  Spilling of the jizz  That's not what this is about  Can't hang out with a young lady  Under the moonlight  Without spilling some jizz  Does he  No  This is an old  An old  You know  Country song  Pure  It's got some values to it  Is he gonna shoot the jizz  All over the butterfly tattoo  Come on  He's not talking about that  No  He's a little edgy  I'll give you that  But he's not going there  No  Uh uh  Yeah no  He gets a little edgy  Sure  Where does the jizz go?

[01:59:30]  And then he got deeper  Right  With Accidental Racist  Yes, he did  He had the commercial success  Right  Then he was like  I want to say something  Right  Exactly  Cause I  Have you guys seen  There are people darker than us  Yeah  And someone's got to talk about it  Their hair's all curly and shanty  You'd be amazed  Alright, here we go  People are mad at us  People are mad  Don in Texas  Go ahead, Don  Hey, y'all need to back the fuck off  Man, this is my goddamn wedding song  Is it really?

[02:01:00]  Fuck  Everyone thought Cher died  Look, they're talking about accidental racist  Oh, hold on  Accidental racist  The red flag on my chest  Somehow's like the yellow  On the corner of the south  And I just walked him right in the room  Well, the media will love it  Cause it's a guilty white person, of course  He gave this song  Paisley sings about his appreciation  For the Confederate flag  And his role in Southern culture  LL Cool J makes a cameo  To give his take on the situation  Oh  Paisley says he's serious about the tune 
[02:01:30]  But it's not a publicity stunt  He says LL Cool J was wearing a Yankees cap  When he recorded his verse  Okay  Hmm  Give us a head on starting point  What does that mean?  Bob, they don't even have an opinion on it  That was the most non-reporting reporting  LL was wearing a Yankee hat  Give us a fuck  He wore a Klan hood  I'd want to hear about it  But who cares  Guess what?  Black people like to wear Yankee hats  God  Why is that shocking?  What is happening?  What year are we in?  I don't know  I think it's because, you know  The Yankees represent the North 
[02:02:00]  God  I get it  The North and the South  And still so, you know  And this is why I'm giving up on Twitter  Yeah  Because Margaret Thatcher died  A lot of people thought it was Cher  As in that Cher  That Cher  Could you get the story they just did on CNN?

I can't believe me I want to  Because it's fucking, you know  I love Austin  It's not selling  Tell them you fucking pulled a hammy or something  I want to go to the fight instead  Because if it was sold out  Or if it was close to sold out  But it's not  You could sell tickets  They're in Austin  Maybe you meet a nice girl down there  You've had a black friend

[02:06:30]  It's like a road map  Yeah so that'll be tomorrow  And then I'm gonna be at Bananas  Do you have conflicts in your family  As far as scheduling kid events?  Um  What do you mean?  Within the kids?  Well like it's my son's third birthday  But then I got a nephew  Who's doing a  You know  One of those religious things  So I'm not sure which one  Well you're kid over  Anyone else right?  I know but it's like fuck  Now like  Now I'm gonna see who likes who  In my family 
[02:07:00]  Cause I think we're still  Scheduling the birthday party  Then we're gonna make  Family members choose  Yeah that's what you gotta do  You just gotta stick  You gotta say no  To a lot of stuff  Religious thing  Greater than  Third year old  Three year old's birthday  Religious thing should come  After everything  Everything should come  Before the religious thing  Birthday is much more important right?  Yeah  Yeah  Man  It's your birthday  It's silly  In my family after like  The fifth birthday  That's when we start  Like tapping out  As far as going to  Every birthday party  Yeah you gotta say no  First few you gotta go right? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah of course  There's too much going on  You gotta say no  You can't  You can't do everything  You can't say yes to everything  And you gotta put your kids  Ahead of all the other ones  Nice  I like how you think  And it's not rude  It's just you love those kids too  But you know  Not so much  You don't like them?  I'm kidding  Not so much  I'm kidding  I have found that  I don't care about my nephews  And nieces as much  Since I've had kids  Amazing  They were kind of my kids  Yeah  Before I had kids  Yeah  Oh every step of the way 
[02:08:00]  I was all in  You actually think like  Oh I love them as much  As I would my own kid  Then you're like  Oh I don't really like them that much  I would bring them to sporting events  Like they were my own  It was like I got to rent a kid  It was nice  As soon as my first kid popped out  I'd  Not so much  Yeah  Who are they?  I'm just polite  It was his birthday yesterday  Oh we forgot again  I used to be all in  Yeah  I'd be the cool uncle  Bringing all this shit  Yeah  I did it too  It was great  But then no 
[02:08:30]  God I hope my brother's not listening right now  He probably feels the same way  Yeah he probably does  He understands  Speaking of kids  What's the problem with the mohawk?  I just saw on CNN  Somebody  Some kid in kindergarten  Got suspended  You're suspending  Kids that young  For going to school with a mohawk?  Yeah  And the kid didn't go out  And get his own mohawk  So why is he suspending the kid?  What's wrong with the mohawk?  What is wrong with the mohawk?  It signals a maniac  It signals a bad parenting  And bad kid  Why?  It's a bad seed 
[02:09:00]  When you have a newborn  They send you home with your baby  And he has a mohawk  Every single time  That's because they only have that hair  That's true  They only have that  They're trying to make it look like something  There's a lot of kids  I went on a class trip yesterday  You did?  Yeah  You had to be the chaperone?  I was the chaperone  Where was the trip to?  To the Museum of Natural Histories  Nice  Dinosaurs?  Uh, Indians  You went Indians  Woodland Indians  Eastern Woodland Indians  You went Indians  I would have went dinosaurs  It wasn't up to me  How many, uh, how many, uh, chaperones are there? 
[02:09:30]  There were three  And, uh, it was very cute  But what I noticed  There's a lot of little boys  With a lot  With very long hair  Forget the mohawk  Hold on, before  Because, you know, that's going to be a thing  Because his mohawk's distracting, by the way  My brother wrote  I'm right here, you know  Your brother  You heard the whole thing  Uh-oh  Jeepers  See you at the hockey game tonight, Scott  Well, yeah, but  Your brother doesn't like your kid as much as he likes your kids 
[02:10:00]  I assume so  Absolutely  It's all relative, right?  Anyway, chaperone  No dinosaurs  Woodland Indians  No dinosaurs  Woodland Indians  But, uh, the reason I bring it up  Is, like, all these boys have long girl hair  That's the style now?  Yeah  Are you going to let your guy do that?  I mean, below the shoulder  Well, my, uh, my wife likes  Second grade  My wife likes the hair short  I like it longer  Mm-hmm  It's, uh, it's like below his earlobe now  And I like it that way  But she's ready to, you know  Get it all short again  Yeah 
[02:10:30]  I don't know  The mohawk is insane  Why?  The line is they suspend him  Because it's distracting  How about, okay, good  Then get rid of some little girl  Who's wearing a burka  Because it's distracting  Get rid of some little  How about you get rid of the kid  With a fucking, a yarmulke  Because it's just  Oh, that's right  Religion is, is okay  But just a personal decision isn't  It's, uh  Nothing wrong with this kid's mohawk  Of course not  I think it's stupid  But that's his, that's him  And his, that's his parents' prerogative  He's a weirdo  It's an accepted hairstyle at this point  As long as you don't make it  Into the fan thing  How about if he was  American Indian, though? 
[02:11:00]  The tall peacocky one  If he was American Indian  They'd let him stay  Yeah, I still can't accept that  But the little, uh, what do they call it?  A faux hawker  Fucking  Yeah  Those are right  Now, he's a weirdo  He should be kicked out of school  Fucking assholes  Anything else in that story  We're missing, Sam Roberts?  Where was it?  That's about it?  The school's handbook  It was, uh  In the handbook?  Yeah, there's a school handbook  In Springfield, Ohio  Um, and the school's handbook  States that  Hair shall be worn  Above the eyebrows  And must be kept  Clean, neat, and trimmed 
[02:11:30]  Uh, hair styling  Or coloring arrangements  Which are disruptive  Or distracting  Oh  Are not permissible  Okay  Isn't it disruptive  For the first day  The kid comes in  And then after that  The kids don't give a fuck  They're onto something else  Kids never care  Who would allow  Like, what kind of  Fucking cock parents  Allow the school  To dictate their kids' hairstyle  As far as color  And distracting  They don't have a choice  But they really  Fucking fight individuality  Yeah, they don't have a choice  What about school uniforms? 
[02:12:00]  Uh  Other than them being hot  I was gonna say  Completely acceptable  On the girls  I don't think you need them  No  Everybody dresses the same  Like, like, like  You teach kids  To be individuals  And then you tell them  They all gotta dress the same  It's just stupid  Yeah  It's stupid  Lockstep  And the fat girl  Doesn't look as good  As the  Never  The thin girl  In the uniform  So now she's uncomfortable  My favorite  Because she would wear something  To hide her fatness  And now she has to  Wear a skirt  Now she has to  Play by the rules  My favorite thing 
[02:12:30]  When I was little  Like in fifth grade  Was when they would  Hand out t-shirts  To the whole class  Yeah  But they would give  All the kids  XL t-shirts  Because that way  It would not be too small  For the one fat kid  That it would fit  But instead  We would just make fun of him  Because his t-shirt  Actually fit in all of ours  We were swimming in our shirts  What a waste  Fat kid  One fat kid  Had his shirt fit  How about  You give the fat kid  A fat shirt  And everyone else  Regular shirts  And you cut the tags off  Yeah  Problem solved  Right 
[02:13:00]  So they don't know  It's an XL  We've got the big shirt  We have a giant shirt here  For one big fat kid  So they wasted all the t-shirts  Because you're not going to wear  A shirt that looks like  A dress on you  No  I mean none of us  Could wear our  Dare t-shirts  Until it was cool  We all started doing drugs  And wear the dare shirt anyway  Listening to Hendrix  At that point or what  Well Hendrix  The Doors  What  When you got into the drugs  What music did you discover  Well I never got into drugs  But  Pink Floyd  Little Floyd  No I mean I was a  Kid  Did another brick in the wall  Talk to you 
[02:13:30]  Late 90s  So  Nothing  So vanilla ice  I guess yes  Maybe some vanilla ice  And uh  Cool Moe D  We got the sheriff shit  So enough on the Mohawk  My kid officially starts  A school program  In September  Oh yeah  I am going to have stories  Because I don't know  How I'm going to deal  With this shit as a parent  What do you mean  I've heard all the stories  From everybody else  Over the last few years  Yeah  Just the shit they're doing  Now in school  Yeah  But you know  I don't know  My kids are in public school  And it's  Not too bad  No  The total freedom  It's not as bad 
[02:14:00]  As the stories I hear  No they let their  Freak flag fly  Okay  They do whatever they want  Really  Alright that's good to know  Yeah  I mean the hardest part  For you is going to be  Just being in a school  Environment again  Which you  Were so happy to leave  And now  You're back  Listening to people  And you know  Well the other thing  Is because  You know my  My siblings decide  To have kids  At you know  A normal age  So they got like  It's over with  Yeah I'm  I'm the oldest  And my  My brothers and sisters 
[02:14:30]  Have kids that are  They're up there now  Yeah  And you're just  We're talking  15 years old now  And the one thing  That I don't understand  Is like  All of a sudden  My sister  And my brothers  They have to do  Homework again  They have to do  Their own kids homework  It's a big thing  Yeah  It's a big  You do your kids homework  No I just tell them  To do it  Oh good for you  My wife gets more  Involved with it  And she's like  She'll be like  This is wrong  You've got to do this  The right way  And they get in fights 
[02:15:00]  And I'm like  It's your homework  You screw it up  You go bring it back  To the teacher  Like if she shows me  And it looks crummy  I'm like well look  I'm not going to correct  This is wrong  Either you  And you just bring it in  And let the teacher  Judge you  And then she'll learn  From that  You don't have to learn  From me yelling at you  I remember I wanted to do  Something with my sister  And she goes  I can't  I have a book report  That I have to do  No  I'm like what are you  Talking about  Really  She's going to do  The book report  For her kid  It's ridiculous  I'm like what  I'm going to have to 
[02:15:30]  Do book reports again  It's a lame way  To raise kids  Because now these kids  They don't know  How to do anything  How to do anything  For themselves  Our parents had no clue  What I was doing  Homework wise  Really  It was totally up to you  And then you brought  Home your report card  That's the only thing  They saw  Right  And if it was bad  You would get your ass kicked  And then you'd have to  Just rally  No parents today  Are very involved  With the homework part  Extremely involved  I remember when I got  A C minus  In conduct  And the teacher  Put next to it  Gift  It was a gift 
[02:16:00]  Oh really  I would always  I would only get  In case you were going  To argue it  The point  No but she was saying  Like you just barely  Made a gift  So don't even argue  I'm fucking  Probably you know  14  I was maybe  Sophomore in high school  Or maybe I was younger  I don't remember  That's funny  I would always get  Ends and needs  To improve in conduct  That really is funny  That's hilarious  My conduct was always bad  Were you really bad  Always  Really  I never did well in conduct  Wow  Ever  Just attention and jokes 
[02:16:30]  In the middle of class  Oh nonsense  Which teacher did you drive  Craziest  All of them  Every one of them  Every one of them  If your kid breaks his arm  And goes to school  Wouldn't that be distracting  The cast  So is that breaking  One of the rules  You can't have your kid  Dressing up like a psychopath  And going to school  Like taxi driver  You gotta conform  Conforming is one thing  But the act of going to school 
[02:17:00]  Is conforming I think  And the act of doing the work  And doing the assignments  If you're doing that  I think you're conforming  And there's lines  With individuality  Like alright  The kid's being a douche  But a mohawk  First of all  A mohawk is more about  The parent's identity  Not the kid  Exactly  At that age  For sure  That's the parents  Trying to be rock and roll parents  Yeah  But  With violence in schools  Isn't it kind of cool  To call out the weirdos  Once in a while  And be like  This guy's a little bit  Of a freak out  As long as you're honest about it  As long as they're honest about it 
[02:17:30]  Because they don't call  They're so selective  On 100%  We don't judge  We don't  It's almost like  Zero tolerance  Is simply because  Administrators  And people at work  Don't want to just go  No you can't do that  Right  Because they are too afraid  To defend themselves  In an argument against parents  Uh huh  They can't just go  Your kid is messed up  It's zero tolerance  Because they know the difference  Between the kid that draws the gun  Who's good natured  And the kid who's going to  Shoot people  Right  They know the difference  Right 
[02:18:00]  But you can't get  The little worthless  Dumpy fucking dud kid out  Right  So they say  No kid can draw  All the good kids  Have to suffer  Right  It's awful  We got a teacher  Who wants to explain  Why uniforms are a great idea  Hey teach  Hey teacher  Let's go Greg  The teacher in D.C.  Good morning  Boy  Morning  Morning  Listen  The reason uniforms  Are a good idea  Especially where I am  Is because I work  In an area  That Anthony  Would consider hell 
[02:18:30]  And  The people  Who come to my school  Dress in a way  That get them beat up  Get them smacked around  Get them robbed  In the neighborhood  Get them  Um  Just  I mean  Murdered  Oh gang colors  Articles  Over articles of clothing  Uh huh  Whether it's gang colors  Or expensive articles  Of clothing  Girls come to school  Dressed like  Whores  Because that's  The new thing  To do  We had a girl 
[02:19:00]  Recently  Who came to school  In a shirt  That came down  Past her ass  And leggings  That's it  Jesus  And these are kids  That  Whose parents  Don't give a crap  About them  They don't pay  Attention to their  Homework  They don't pay  Attention to where  They are  Or what they're  Doing  We are the  Babysitters  Eight  Sometimes  Twelve  Hours a day  Wow  We have kids  That come to the  School  At 6.30  In the morning  And don't leave  Until 6.30 
[02:19:30]  Or 7 o'clock  At night  And if they're  Not in a uniform  Then they're  Trying to do  What they can  To dress like  All the other  Kids in the school  And if they're  Poor  They're gonna  Rob them  And in this  Area  Sometimes  You know  There are kids  Who have a little  Bit of money  Because they have  An actual job  There are other  Kids who have  Money because  They rob all  The kids who  Have jobs  So I wish  What you're saying  Makes sense  I just wish  The school  Would be honest 
[02:20:00]  About it  And say because  Of this savagery  And horrible  Parenting  And behavior  This is the best way  But I mean  I guess what you're  Saying makes sense  You would know better  I would  It would have been  It would have been  It would have saved me  Embarrassment in 7th grade  When I accidentally  Wore my mom's  Chick jeans  And uh  And came out  Of the locker room  And to a bunch  Of girls screaming  At me that I had  My mom's jeans on  Did you really?  Yeah we were  About the same size  We were about  The same size  I just threw  On these jeans 
[02:20:30]  I just grabbed them  From the laundry room  Oh my god  And then  Walk around  With chick  C-H-I-C  On my ass  And then all the girls  Just waited for me  Outside the locker room  Like hyenas  And as soon as I walked out  Nice chick  Cheers  I'm like trying  To look at my ass  And I'm horrified  If I had a uniform  I wouldn't have that scar  That's funny  Here's another thing  That they don't talk about though  In my school  We have armed guards  That walk around the school 
[02:21:00]  To try to break up  Fights and things  Kids don't get suspended  For beating up teachers  They get sent home  They smack teachers  They throw things  At teachers  They get sent home  Wow  Sometimes they get  Transferred to another class  Jesus Christ  Once a month  I walk into  The boys bathroom  Yay  Yeah  I collect all the money  That's on the floor  From the craps games  That are going on  And I take some other  Teachers out for lunch  Not even a joke  Oh my god  That sounds like a nightmare 
[02:21:30]  This sounds terrible  And that's a public school  Jeez  Where is it?  In the D.C. area  Jeez  Of course  Alright Greg  Thank you  Good luck  What do you think  Of Accidental Racist  I mean  It's a terrific song  Isn't it?  If you  That Brad Paisley song  Could clear up  That whole school  Sure  Alright so  We got the Cher thing  Yeah  So that  Thatcher really  I keep  Thatcher  Thatcher was 
[02:22:00]  Trending on Twitter  And people thought  That meant  That Cher  And they were  Really bummed out  That Cher died  Do you get some  Of the tweets?  Feeling very  Uncomfortable about  People celebrating  Someone's death  No matter how  Hated she was  That's true  That's for Thatcher  That's for Thatcher  I want the Cher ones  Oh  And Twitter  Very much alive  With chat about  Margaret Thatcher  But a ham handed  Hashtag is making 
[02:22:30]  Some people wish  They could turn back  Time and add  Some capital letters  Hashtag  Now Thatcher's dead  Being misread  As now that  Cher is dead  Just look at  Some of the  Misguided social  Sharing  Is Cher dead?  Gone to join  Sonny  R.I.P.  Cher  Ricky Gervais  Came to the  Hashtag rescue  Correcting the  Record for  Mistaken mourners  Turns out  A website  Critical of  Thatcher  Is responsible  For the confusion  To avoid  Such Twitter  Fails in the  Future  There's a rising  Call for  Greater use  Of camel case 
[02:23:00]  Where we use  Capital letters  To separate words  That's what  I've been doing  For years  Just in case  You can't imagine  Life after love  Of this woman  For now  The panic  Is subsiding  Don't worry  Cher is fine  Very fine  Indeed  Wow  That's some  Dumb people  Some hardcore  Reporting right there  Yes  Where's  Paul Anka  He's 930  For Paul Anka  You did it  My way  Well we got  A little  Audio from 
[02:23:30]  Geraldo Rivera  Do do do do do do  He's going to have  To Bill O'Reilly  A little bit  Oh  This is another  Terrific clip  You can never  Use the expression  Illegal alien  Again  It is  It's like saying  Negro  Or homosexual  Homosexual  Is accurate  Yeah  Why can't you  Say homosexual  Everyone needs  Their word now  Or phrase  What are you  Supposed to call  Homosexual  Exactly  We had 
[02:24:00]  Geraldo on once  He's a strange bird  He's a fucking  Baby  Like he was  A good guy  Oh he got all  Bullshit about the  Language  He's like oh shut up  He's as biased as anybody  You can't say  Illegal  Immigrant  I don't understand that  If you're not here  Legally  You're a fucking  Illegal alien  Go fuck yourself  Yeah what are you  Supposed to call him  I don't care  Where you're from  Travis talked about  His wife  And how hard it was  And how much money  He had to spend  To get her here legally  And how much work  It was  If you're not legal  Here you're an 
[02:24:30]  Illegal alien  Go home  Or just become legal  You're just  An accidental visitor  Again  It is pejorative  It's like saying  Negro  Or homosexual  It is a loaded term  That doesn't accurately describe  Alright so now  I can't use  You cannot use it  I can't use illegal aliens  Why don't you just give me a list  Of stuff I can say  I can give you an illegal alien  And Bible thumping  I think maybe after what  You experienced in the last  Couple of days  Maybe you should put that aside 
[02:25:00]  Although I agree with you  Substantively on that  You know me  I'm not giving into this stuff  You're crazy  If somebody's in here  And breaks our law  Immigration laws  They're an illegal alien  They're not an illegal alien  If they're here  And it's just their status  They're an undocumented immigrant  Give them some  What's the difference  What's the difference  Just the softer  Good for Bill O'Reilly  It's the same thing  They're undocumented  No they're here illegally  Good for O'Reilly  You can't say homosexual  That just  That messes his whole argument 
[02:25:30]  Geraldo  This is  You're a member of the media  Right  They're the worst  These guys  The fucking worst  In America  We're really all about  Making sure we can't say  Words anymore  Right exactly  So fucked up  How'd it get to this point  We said it actually  With Nappy Head at Ho  We said watch  Right  There's gonna be a  Bunch of words  That are gonna be  Presented as other words  You can't say  You can't say homosexual  Every group now  Has their word 
[02:26:00]  You can't say  Even though they use  That word among themselves  Right  Your own special word  Your own special word  If you're part of this group  You get to use it  You're illegally  In this country  What are we supposed to say  What was  He said you can't say  Illegally  You have to call them  Undocumented immigrants  Immigrants  Right  What the hell  That sounds  What's the difference  That's like saying  The Edinburgh  With the G's  And the A  Right 
[02:26:30]  What is the difference  I don't know  Semantics  Semantics  I don't know  Well that's just dumb  Good for O'Reilly  You need some black friends  You need  Yeah  It's nonsense  He's an idiot  Sam you looking at me  No  Why  I'm  I'm in awe of you  Shut up  It's kinda gross  Now 
[02:27:00]  That's weird  What's going on with Fandango  Now I told you  I heard the sighing out there  As soon as I said that  I told you I didn't want to do this  I said I'm done  Bringing up wrestling on this show  Right  We went a little long  With wrestling yesterday  People were mad at us  Because we talked about  Going to Wrestlemania  It's not like we just went  To a regular little wrestling show  Right  Wrestlemania was in our backyard  So me and Jimmy said  Fuck it  Let's go check out  What this is all about  So then of course  We'd come on the radio  And talk about it  Right  It was a little too much  For some people  How many hours  And I don't even think 
[02:27:30]  It was an hour  Really  An hour on wrestling  It's time to fucking relax  It's all good  Did you love it?  Um  Did I love it?  I liked it  Uh huh  I liked it  I loved it  I loved the entrances  That these guys make  Right  At the big shows  Eric's helping  I think Eric  Putting on the Fandango music  The entire time  Annoyes people  I know  I don't  I don't mind  Annoying our listeners  Right  I kinda enjoy that part  Of this  This job  Right  When I know something  That's bothersome 
[02:28:00]  I have no problem  Going with it  Do you watch wrestling at all?  No  Did you used to?  Yeah  When I was little  Yeah  When I was little  When I was in college  There were guys  That were still into it  And I wasn't any longer  But they were still really into it  I watched growing up  And then took a long time off  But then when we were at N.E.W.  All the guys came through  So we really got to know them  Sure  And then we were in again  And it was  It was pretty hot  The writing was hilarious 
[02:28:30]  Yeah  They really went with some edgy  You know  Yow yeah  Comedy shit  Right  Right  And then I don't know  Then I tapped out  And now  Because of this dumb Fandango guy  I'm back in  And he came in here  And Jimmy got to lotion him up  Oh really?  Yes he did  Yes I did  You lotioned him up  And he was a little eager  The little video that we shot  He's reaching for Fandango  And he misses  It's the past  Got nervous  I didn't notice it at first  I noticed it  Watch  I missed it 
[02:29:00]  Watch  I'm losing his arm  Watch  Jimmy's oiling him  Down  I lose his arm  What?  Because Fandango is basically saying enough  This is a character I'm playing  And Jimmy's getting into it  Fandango wanted us to know  That this is a character he's playing  And he's not living this type of lifestyle  My Twitter blew up from that fucking little second on Raw  Do you have it?  Yeah yeah sure  I don't watch  I was busy 
[02:29:30]  You were on it  I like how you miss him and then rub your own arm  Yeah  Well he had the lotion in his hands  Might as well moisturize  That's what's humiliating  Huh?  29 is literally taking over New York and New Jersey this week  So there's this whole  Whole montage of stuff that was going on  And there you go  What's my name?  There you go  Oh there's Jimmy  I'm like superfan  That was it?  No  No  No  No  No  So this guy 
[02:30:00]  He came out of nowhere  And has so much heat  Really?  And he's only been around a few months right?  A couple months?  If that  If that  And he went from a nobody with this new character  They don't know if it's going to work  And then he's wrestling in Wrestlemania  That's like a huge deal in that world obviously  They started playing like little vignettes saying Fandango's coming  Right?  Right  And then he showed up  They were like today's going to be his debut 
[02:30:30]  And he started coming to the ring  And they would announce him  And they said  He said you're saying my name wrong  So I'm not going to wrestle until you say my name right  It was a great gimmick  That's funny  And so like week after week he would come out  And they wouldn't say his name right  And then he wouldn't wrestle  That's great  I know  That's good  Yeah there is  I mean the sense of humor to it all is really good  Well  It's absurd  It's completely absurd  So why are we talking about wrestling today?  Because  What happened?  Last night  Was  Last night  Of all the years I've watched wrestling 
[02:31:00]  The most insane crowd I've ever seen in my life  Right  And during Fandango's match  Tom Pop is putting his coat on  Hurry up before we lose him  You think he's going home?  I think so  I think this is  Good seeing you guys  They started singing his song  Like while he was wrestling  And then after the match  They started singing  And his song has no lyrics  Right  The whole crowd started humming his song  They fucking love this guy  It's the weirdest thing man  Like watch this  It hits and hits  Watch this quick clip  This is as the match is starting 
[02:31:30]  And listen to the crowd  Did he win?  Well yeah yeah  By DQ  But listen  Who did he wrestle last night?  By Jerry Queen  He was wrestling a guy named Kofi Kingston last night  But Jericho did a run in  So that's going to keep going a little bit  So listen to the crowd  And here we go  Kingston and Fandango  That's a pretty slick move right there  I heard he can even make a tissue dance 
[02:32:00]  Oh he can?  How's he going to make a tissue dance?  Put a little boogie in it  No more time  He's singing his song  He's singing his music  So Jericho comes out  Right  Beats him up  Right  You know  He's on the ground  And they go  You know  The winner of this match  By disqualification  Is Fandango  Right  And Fandango's knocked out  Winning last night 
[02:32:30]  But he did get lucky  Against his six-time world champion  The crowd is still singing the song  As a result of a disqualification  Fandango  Still won?  It's  Fandango  After he got his ass kicked  He's going  That's to correct the guy  And listen to where he plays music  Yeah  Not quite the debut 
[02:33:00]  Fandango  Look at the audience  Everyone's dancing and singing  The WWE fans are singing  Fandango  They're going crazy  Look at that  This is the craziest thing I've ever seen  I love it  Where are we?  It's Fizarro world  Everyone plays his act  Jeez that's so fucked up  To get that much heat that quickly 
[02:33:30]  And then I was getting all these messages  That they were singing his song  Like throughout  Like after the show was over  Right  They were singing his song  To the point that after the show  Went off the air  Right  John Cena was in the ring  Right  And he just  They just turned on Fandango's music  Because that's all they would sing  Wow  That's funny  Down the halls  As they're exiting the building  It's great  Singing his song  Wow  And they get into the parking lot  And everybody's on their car horns  Going beep  Beep  Beep  Beep  Beep  Beep  It's unbelievable  It really is unbelievable  Unbelievable 
[02:34:00]  Because it's only  I don't care about wrestling  And this hit me too  I'm like what the fuck  Is this whole thing about?  They made him a star  Who's the last guy  That got such heat so quickly  Probably Backlund  Bob Backlund was it?  No it wasn't Bob Backlund  The Polish Hammer?  Ivan Putsky?  No not him either  Fuck  Who then?  I don't know  Superfly  Superfly  Must have been Jimmy Saka  I don't remember  I'm talking about heat this quickly  Anybody that's popped up out of nowhere  He's wrestled one match  And just 
[02:34:30]  Is the shit  And everyone's all in  Yeah no I don't  It's great because it changed the audience  The audience is now like this  Yeah  Calypso loving  They're like a Key West now  He took these animals  And now they're dancing around  It's great  They made him last night though  Because like you said  At Wrestlemania  It's hard to tell  Because there's a lot of non-wrestling fans in the audience  Right  So they're just like  But then the night after  The fact that the arena  Yeah now it's the hardcore fans  They never  The arena's never saying somebody's song to them  Especially when there's no lyrics 
[02:35:00]  It's great  Amazing  Alright  We're gonna take a break  And get ready for Paul Anka  Yep  Promoting his new book  My Way  He did it his way  Let me have that song baby  I'm a little nervous  Really?  Get the bells out of there  Paul Anka?  I get nervous when they're like  Really over the top legends like this  Yeah  You should be nervous  Get the camera  What's your strategy Jimmy?  None of them make me know  I'll just ask him  So  You don't wanna get him  You like to play the piano 
[02:35:30]  Do ya?  Oh yeah  I wanna get a picture with him  And a video and everything  Sure  He should be a good interviewer  He'll be fun to talk to  He's met them all  What do you mean get a video with him?  I'm just saying  Because Sam videotaped  Yeah we videotaped this shit  And then it goes nowhere  For the most part  Yeah  Why would we put someone  Sirius XM's  Our job is to get the things in the cars  What was that about yesterday?  It's just nonsense  But what was the question?  I said something along the lines of  Sorry I'm eating a grape  I've given up on making  Trying to make this any more than it is  I love my gig 
[02:36:00]  I love the money  Right right right  But  You like those grapes?  We're being passed by podcasts  And the response was  Well you know  This is a different company  Our job is to get stuff on in cars  And it's like  You just don't understand  That it all funnels down  To getting radios in cars  If they can't make money off it immediately  They don't understand it  People listen on their home computers all the time  It's just  It's such a terrible  Narrow  Short-sighted way 
[02:36:30]  And if you think I'm crazy  Look at where podcasts are  And look at where they are a few years ago  You didn't see it coming  With one lousy tweet  Rogan will tweet  You know  I'm podcasting right now  Whatever  And it'll be someone I'm interested in  And I pop it on  On my phone  I'm watching it  Right  It has to be a content-like universe  You know what I mean?  Like you can't just be on in a car  And expect people to be loyal to your show  Yeah  It doesn't work that way  Like people need to be able to 
[02:37:00]  Carry whatever they like  It has to be accessible wherever they go  Right  And they have to see it  And hear it  And everything  That's the way content works now  It's amazing  That's right, baby  Right  Even Frankie Blue Eyes knows it  In my day  We didn't have podcasts  No?  What'd you have?  We broke his arm  And put it in a cast  Boo!  Be more funny  This is going great 
[02:37:30]  Okay?  So to speak  Literally  I hate you  Okay, fuck it  What's next?  So  Is it this right?  Okay, okay  Save it for the feel  Sam, I'm hurt  Shooky-ducky-crack-crack  Holy shit  All right  Sam will grab the camera  Tom will apologize to listeners individually 
[02:38:00]  It wasn't me  It was Sinatra  All right  And Jim Norton  Will be at Caroline's this weekend  You're doing the Thursday show?  Thursday through Sunday  Yeah  Nice  Nice  And  This week?  Yeah  Wait, you gotta do Sunday too?  Yeah  This Thursday through this Sunday?  Yeah  At Caroline?  How many shows is that?

[02:38:30]  They'll add shows  They get three in one night?  Yeah, they'll add  They'll add one Thursday  I remember Reagan  Brian Regan  Excuse me, Reagan  Brian Regan doing three in one night  Sure  He was out of his mind by the third show  That's what real comics can do  Just  I will have six shows  Saturday is sold out  But  And Friday is almost sold out  So  Thursday and Sunday  Nice  That's good  That's not good  Go see Jimmy  It's unexpected  I mean you should do that  If you're doing Caroline's  You know  So I'm not doing anybody a favor  Nice  I'm not selling out Thursday and Sunday  Let's sell it out

I spend a lot of time with all these people  I don't like Polanka  You know how I talked about going to Wrestlemania with Jim Norton?  Yeah  I actually went with Edgar  Oh you did?  And I don't know how to talk to him  Like I know 
[02:39:30]  Socially?  Yeah he wants me to talk to him like he's actually Edgar  And I failed miserably  I've seen everyone else around him talk to him as the character  Right  And I can't do it  Yeah how would you?  I tried  And then I started heating up inside  Because I knew I failed miserably  But I've seen his ex-girlfriend do it  Kenny does it  Jonathan does it  Sam just showed you he can do it  I tried  We're on the food line  I just tried  I felt like such a douchebag  I'm like I've known this guy for 10-12 years 
[02:40:00]  And I feel like an idiot  Now I've got to talk to this other person  Yes you do  Say try  See if you can do it  I don't want to talk to him  Why not?  Why not?  I don't like Tom  Why?  Tom Peppy  I don't like him  He's gutter trash  Why would you say that?  He's a judgmental piece of shit is why he says that  Shit  Why do you have your mouth like that?  I'm with you  I don't like it  That's weird right?  It is  I'm just pulling your fucking chain 
[02:40:30]  Ah  Chip  Look at his back the whole time  He was here the whole time  Like the army jacket  What are you going in the fucking army?  That isn't funny  This  Is the OPN at 3 show  This  Is the OPN at 3 show  Selfie here  I think Paul just  Kind of just walked in in the middle  Did anyone like help you out?  They brought Paul in while we're doing a live reach  He's just standing there awkward 
[02:41:00]  It's a pleasure to meet you Paul Anka  A pleasure  Yeah let's get a good picture  Get over here Jimmy  What are you guys doing?  This is a big photo op  Nice  I love it  I can't stop reading the book  Yeah the book My Way  It's going to be a big hit for Paul Anka  It's a lot of stuff  I wish I had more time with it  Because I haven't finished it  And you started  Like you've heard a million stories about old Vegas  And Vegas in the 50s and the 60s 
[02:41:30]  But for some reason  The way you described it  Is the best description I've heard of Vegas  Back in those glory days  Like it really made me crave  Going to Vegas back in the 60s  Well it was a place to be craved  I mean it was the real deal  When I was out there  I mean the way I laid it out very carefully  Was you know a lot of it was hearsay  A lot of people were on the periphery  Trying to capture it  But when you're there  And you're living it  You're in the steam room  With Sinatra and Davis 
[02:42:00]  And Dean Martin  And you're all running around nude  And that stuff happens  Did you ever see Milton Berle nude?  Oh good  And his third leg  Is that true?  All true  All true  There's enough for all of us in this room  Believe me  All true  Well Frank was pretty good too  Really?  Oh yes  Oh yes  Of the Rat Pack  Did Sinatra have the biggest hog  Are we on the air?  Yes  Oh gee  I didn't mean anything I said  Were you kidding me? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah Francis was very well in doubt  Guy Marks  Yeah  Milton Berle was the guy  Yeah  That was it  I mean I didn't get down to measure it  But I had good perception  I was watching  I went on just you know  Just you know how you get into a YouTube loop  And you start watching live videos  And I was just watching Sammy Davis  From  He was overseas  It was after Candyman went number one  Right  And I think he  I mean everyone knew Sammy  But people forget how like  He was a great singer 
[02:43:00]  Oh  He was incredible  I mean you know  He wanted to be Frank  But the guy as a singer  Was sensational  Frank adored him  They had a little outing there  Somewhere in the middle  Because of something  But when you get down to it  Pound for pound  He was the greatest entertainer  For me  I mean I'd sit and watch this guy  At the Sands  You know we knew each other  Very very well  Nobody liked him  Nobody liked this guy  And I just  I learned a lot from him  He lived his life  You know he really lived it  To the fullest  In a time where we weren't  Really a media driven society  And the stuff that he got into 
[02:43:30]  And put his  Courage of his convictions  Behind it  You gotta  You gotta really hand it to him  Because he went through  A lot of adversity  And had a tough  Tough life  But so talented  And I don't see anybody  Today like him  A lot of guys copy him  But there's nobody  Like Sammy Davis  Or Frank Sinatra  And didn't Sinatra  Like I don't know much  About Sinatra  Compared to other artists  But he really  Like he wouldn't work  If they wouldn't treat  Sammy right  Like he really  Loved Sammy Davis  He loved Dean Martin 
[02:44:00]  He loved Sammy  He loved his friends  Put his foot down  Talked about civil rights  And all that garbage  That went on back then  Frank literally  Turned all that around  When they wouldn't let  Any blacks into the hotels  It was Frank  And all of us  That just said  We're not here  If they're not here  So he was very  Very supportive of Sammy  From day one  And that's the kind  Of guy he was  You know in a time  Where you guys are  You know you're not  My age obviously  But pop music  And that whole genre  Stuff  Show business was 
[02:44:30]  In its infancy stage  Back then  You know when you  Had Vegas  And you had that crowd  That was it  You know Bobby  Darren and I  Would look at those guys  And go we want  To be like them  Right  We didn't see  Hendrix coming  You didn't see  The Beatles coming  You didn't see  Hard Rock coming  Thus it was all  That Vegas vibe  The mob guys  Who ran it  Who were great  They were gentlemen  Shook your hand  The safest place to be  You look at Vegas today  With what's going on  You can get shot  Crossing the strip  Yeah  And all that stuff  That goes on  On these clubs after  And you know  These so-called celebrities  Who have a rough night 
[02:45:00]  And then they wind up  In a hospital  And say it's  Heat exhaustion  You know  It's a whole new town  Out there  Yeah  So yeah  Back then  I loved it  And we loved working  For those guys  They were really  Really cool to work  They took care of you  Absolutely  And you minded your business  And you knew the rules  And they really took care of you  These guys were just gentlemen  All the way through  I mean I've never had a bad rap  Ever  I was going to say  Musically  With Sinatra 
[02:45:30]  You know  He took your song  Which  My way  And made it into  A huge hit  Did you  Can you explain to me musically  What Sinatra had  That made him so special  Well  You know  I look at his genetics  He genetically had  That voice  And that stuff  And then he was a guy  That rehearsed all the time  He was a guy  That just had that it  Right  And the it was  You know  Everybody else after him  Got arrested for loitering  In front of a band  Because he was the guy 
[02:46:00]  You know  I mean  Nobody could do it  Like he did  Because of his phrasing  His whole musical sense  And then  When you compound it  With what he was about  You had all of this  Perception working for you  That when he went on stage  And with his work ethic  He just had that thing  He knew what to do  With a song  And never  Ever  Went into an area  That he didn't understand  To try and sing something  Now with that said  Is it true you gave away  My way  For free  For free  What's the story behind that 
[02:46:30]  Because I was saying earlier  As a songwriter  You had to know  You had something  You just had to know  You were in the zone  Like this is absolutely  Going to be a hit  Well prefacing that  You know  For years  You know  Mr. Sinatra used to tease me  About writing for him  Now I'm a kid  You know  You never know in life  Shit happens  All of a sudden  You're in  Now you got this kid  Working out there in Vegas  Youngest ever  How old were you?  Youngest at the Copa  I started at 18  18  Wow  And then I evolved  Into my 20s  But the point is  You know  He always  He never liked pop music  He loved the good stuff 
[02:47:00]  And so he should have  And he'd always say  You're going to write me something  I never  I didn't have the balls  To give him lonely boy  Or puppy love  He would have thrown me  Out of a window  So as the years  As the years evolved  Right  Don Costa  Who I introduced him to  Was my genius  And my producer  I introduced him to  Mr. Sinatra  And I was in Miami  Working the fountain blue  And it was the thing  To do back then  And he called up  And said  Kid we're going to dinner  So whenever he called  And said go to dinner  You went to dinner 
[02:47:30]  And bring your passport  Because you never know  Where you wind up  The next day  So I went to dinner  And he told me that night  Along with everyone  At dinner  That he was retiring  Really  He'd had it  And what year was this?  This was 67, 68  Somewhere in there  So I was moved by that  I went back to New York  Where I was living here  And I sat down at the piano  At one o'clock in the morning  And I said  This is my last shot  You know  I've got to write something  And I metaphorically  Approached it 
[02:48:00]  With him retiring  And now  The end is near  Oh wow  So I raised the final curtain  And started to write itself  So everything in there  Where I normally  Wouldn't use words  Like I ate it up  And spit it out  It was all Sinatra  All Sinatra  Finished it at 5 in the morning  Called him in Vegas  Took a demo out  Gave it to him  With Costa  Two months later  He called me from the studio  He said  Kid listen to this  And he put the phone up  To the speaker  I'm in New York  In my apartment  He played me my way 
[02:48:30]  For the first time  He started crying  Wow  Because I knew I had something  Just knew it  Because nobody could sell a song  He could sing the phone book  You know  The man was amazing  He was just  An incredible artist  How old were you?  I was in my late 20s  Late 20s  I was in my late 20s  To write it  R.C. Victor  The label I was at  Were a little pissed  Because I didn't record it  I said look  I'm old enough to write it  But I'm too young to record it  No kidding  It's all about Sinatra  When did you get your version  Out there?  Oh years later  Yeah  Years later  And Elvis' version  I actually have the 
[02:49:00]  You may want to smash me for this  But I prefer Elvis' version  Like I love what Elvis covers songs  And I love that  There's a very great video  Of Elvis at the end  Where he's going  We're going to do a number now  And I don't know the lyrics to it  And he goes  And then the band guy  Had to go  It's my way  And he goes  My way  Like he was just so high  The guy had to tell him  It was my way  And he's holding the fucking lyrics to it  Poor Elvis  You know I used to sit with him in Vegas  At the end  Great artist too  Great voice  Yeah  Great interpreter songs  And we used to sit together  You know near the end  And he used to sit at Caesars backstage 
[02:49:30]  Because he worked the hill  And he'd go  Pauly  I'm going to do that song  Pauly  I really love that my way  And I'd say  Elvis  It's not your kind of song man  You don't want to do that  He said no man  It means a lot to me  I'm going to do that song  So anyway  He does it  And he called me  And he told me about it  And I really got  The kind of the  The intent  And the emotion of it  Because he knew  What he was going through  It was the same kind of vibe  I got from  Sex Pistols  Sid Vicious  Yeah  You know I kind of went 
[02:50:00]  What?  When I first heard it  When Scorsese called  And used it for the movie  But then I understood  It meant a lot to him  I forgot that  I forgot  And they got a lot of shit  From their fans  When they  When they  Covered that song  But their version is great too  Yeah  Yeah real cool  So what I'm saying is  It meant something to Elvis  I loved his version  Absolutely agree  Only because I knew  The back story  And the lead up  Where I tried to talk him out of it  Right right  How he really wanted to do it  Because it meant so much to him  Anyone else do My Way  That we don't talk about? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah  Are there any My Way  That you're like  I'm going to do that guy  Yeah some of those  Yeah I ate it up  And swallowed it  I'll give you a clue  There's some great versions actually  One of my favorites  Is Brooke Benton  Brooke Benton  I don't know  Anna Simone and Brooke Benton  I don't know that one  And the Gypsy Kings  I'll check it out  Yeah you check it out  I'll definitely check it out  Do you like  Do you enjoy when people  Cover your music  And like you don't know about it  Until you hear it on the radio  Or is there something  Where you kind of want to be told  Beforehand  Or are you just happy to hear it?  Well the technicality of it 
[02:51:00]  And the infrastructure of our industry  Is before they do it  They need a license  Oh they do  So they'll send me a piece of paper  Saying so and so  Is going to record it  And you go  Yay or nay  I've never said nay  Right  And you know in front  What's happening  And you love it  You know  Your songs are like your children  You know you can't pick your favorite  You put a lot into it  And when an artist comes along  With a different interpretation  Like Tom Jones  Yeah  You know I could never have done  She's a lady  Tom's got a great voice  He's a great artist  And when I wrote it for him  When somebody like that comes along  And you're writing for them  Yeah I mean it's 
[02:51:30]  You know I started as a writer  It all starts with the song  Like Shakespeare  Plays the thing  Yeah  Without that song you're nowhere  You've got to get back to the music  I mean even today  You've really got to get back to that  Man you wrote a lot of hits  You wrote a lot of hits  And also speaking of Shakespeare  Oh my god  Didn't you want to take his lyrics  When you were younger  And make songs out of them  Which I think is pretty  Ambitious for a really young guy  To read Shakespeare  And go I want to make songs out of this  Well I kind of played around with it  Just to get structure  And see what was in it  It was obviously a lot more complicated  And sophisticated 
[02:52:00]  In kind of the quatrains  And the way he rhymed things  But it was kind of a test  For me to play with it  Because I wanted to be a writer  I was working at a local newspaper  As a cub reporter  And got thrown out of shorthand  Because I hated it  And I took music  And it all started from there  You know and then I saw this girl  Who I had a crush on  This Diana  Who was a few years older  And I started writing  You know in a time  There was no American Idol  You know when I grew up  My link to the world  Was a radio  I'd go sit in the rug  In my mother's living room  And just listen to the radio 
[02:52:30]  We had nothing to relate to  Yeah  And that started turning me on  I knew I had to get to New York  And I knew I loved to write  But it wasn't happening in Canada  So I entered a contest  For IJ food stores  I saw an ad in the paper  It said collect Campbell's Soup wrappers  And you'll win a trip to New York  So I went to IJ  And I got a job  And I was packing groceries  And I was writing down  All the women that bought  The Campbell's Soup  So I win the contest  For my district  I'm on a train with 40 guys  And they brought us down  From Canada  I'm staying at the Sloan House here  Up on the what 
[02:53:00]  38th floor  And I'm looking at New York  Every high rise of my life  I'm from Canada  To 200,000 people  And I knew that this was it  I knew I had to get down here  And make it happen  So it all started  From that whole writing experience  And then evolving into singing  Breaking in a dressing room  When Chuck Berry and Fats Domino  Were in town  And running up to Chuck Berry  And singing my song  He says  It's the worst song I ever heard  Go back to school  I didn't really  It's in his book  And then  But Fats Domino was cool  He got a 
[02:53:30]  He was a nice guy  And anyway  Fade in and fade out  Once a year later  I make Diana  And I'm on tour  With guess who  Fats Domino  And Chuck Berry  Wow  Did he remember you  I think he did  But didn't want to admit it  And how old  You were about 18  I was 16  You were 16  I wrote it at 15  I left at 16  Wow  Was there an arc  To your writing  Did it just kind of  Come out of the gates  Really explosive  Or did you  Mature as  Did you 
[02:54:00]  For you personally  Did you enjoy it  At a certain point  More than another  Yeah  It evolves  Like anything  Yeah  I mean you start  As a young teenager  And you're writing  About stuff  That teenagers  Think about  And what they do  Right  You know  You have to realize  All of us  That started in the business  Any of us  I mean  Even you guys  And what you do  You know  We're not born sophisticated  Right  You get this stroke of luck  You're doing something  You like to do  And then you're scratching  Your way along that  Highway of life  Trying to cope with success  And find out who the hell you are 
[02:54:30]  Right  So as you evolve  Under that premise  As you get older  And learn your craft  Your songs get better  You know  All of a sudden  You're sitting on the beaches  Of Normandy  With Daryl Zanuck  You know  At what  21 years old  And you've got  John Wayne  And Robert Mitchum  And all these guys  That you went to a movie  To watch  And you're trying to remain cool  And you're going  Shit  Look at this  Right  And you're there  With thousands of troops  And then you get inspired  And then you write  The longest day  Right  Now you're the youngest kid  That's nominated  For an Academy Award 
[02:55:00]  At 21  So you evolve  You say  Well I can do that  I'm going to do  The Tonight Show theme  And then you do  The Tonight Show theme  And then Buddy Holly  So yes  You start to learn your craft  If you keep yourself straight  Keep the integrity  Of what you're doing  And continually improve  Improve and mature  Right  Until you get to 27, 28  And you're right my way  Was it a dedication  To the work  That kept you straight  Like when  This is all mind blowing stuff  And there's got to be women  And there's got to be booze  And there's got to be  Tons of stuff  Oh please  What was it that kept you 
[02:55:30]  Kept you grounded  Was it the work  The work ethic  Absolutely  I came  My background  My education  My family  It was about work ethic  I worked as a kid  At 12, 13, 14  I had my own money  Three bucks  But it was a lot for me  So it was work ethic  You know  I look at these kids today  And I really feel for them  Because they're not handling it  For a lot of reasons  But you know  Back then  You hit  You have a number one record  You're making two  Three hundred bucks a week  A lot of money back then  Yeah  But you're realizing  That your life has changed  And you've got a fortunate 
[02:56:00]  Vibe going for you  You know  People are kissing your ass  All day  And you're trying not  To be an asshole  You know  You're going  Wait a second  But you realize  That if you lose that  You know  It's like the old saying  You know  A man is defined  By the occupation  And a woman is defined  By the man she marries  But you know  If you don't got that  Occupation going for you  And something's working for you  You're kind of like  You're lost  It's over  Yeah  And I didn't want to lose that  I knew that if I kept producing  And if I kept working at it 
[02:56:30]  That I could get some longevity out  I just never crossed the line  To where it got me in trouble  Right  Remember I was around that stuff  Yeah  I saw Frankie Lyman shooting up  Wow  And you know  You make these decisions  No and yes  Yeah  And then the Rat Pack  And those guys  Who were great to be around  Yeah  And a lot of fun  But a lot of drinking  And a lot of this  A lot of excess  You do a little of it  Enough  That you can get up  And go to work the next day  And keep what you're about  Right  But good question  Because there's many times  Where you go 
[02:57:00]  I could almost have blown you  You could easily say yes  Well you said something interesting too  In the book  You talk about people  And you said kids  And the fame  And you said that  I wrote the quote down  Famous become an end in itself  Unattached to any achievement  Like people just now want to go  I want to be famous  Not I want to be a songwriter  Or a singer  Exactly  Which will make you famous  They just want the fame  That's the point  When I meet with kids today  And they want to do  Want to do  I just want to be famous  Well what do you want to do  I don't know  I just want to be famous  I want to be famous  What? 
[02:57:30]  Then you got the others  That come up  They said I'm a musician  I'm writing songs  I want to perform  And they hand me a computer  I said what do you mean  They said you're not a musician  It's a computer  You know  And they sit  And they write on these computers  Right  Now I think times change  And I get it  But what we've lost here  In all the technology  In some cases  Is you're losing that heart  And soul and blood  Of what real music  And art was years ago  And when you start losing that  Yeah  And it's all about this and this  Which works in certain sectors  Of life 
[02:58:00]  Yeah  When you lose it in music  Thus Adele  Who steps forward  Out of nowhere  Because the consumer's not stupid  You know  They know what they want  They know what they don't want to hear  So when they hear something  That's got some substance to it  They go to it  And they'll go to good music  You know  I'm sure you've addressed it before  With the very famous  Tape of you yelling about  The guys having shirts  We love that  We had so much fun with that  Paul  I gotta tell you  Oh you and Howard Stern  Howard  We had a blast  We loved it  Listen I get a lot of fan mail  I don't get it 
[02:58:30]  One of what  8,000  The one I love  Is Tommy Lasorda  And the actor  Orson Welles  Have you heard those two?  Oh god yeah  Of course  You know we hired this guy  It was 19  I think it was 1981  And I'm a perfectionist  You know  I go on that stage every night  Like it's the first time  Because you know  I know if you just drop it  A couple of times  You're gone  It's all about reputation  And I'm a stickler  About the music  And right down to 
[02:59:00]  What they're wearing  Because I respect my audience  And this guy we had hired  Had been with us one month  He wasn't that good obviously  He had taped this meeting  That I had  Telling the guys  What was wrong with the show  It's like  What's the analogy  At the end of a bad ball game  Right  You get them in the locker room  Sure  And I'm a straight cat  I mean I just let them know  Right away what it is  So when I heard about it  And it gave slapping back  I said  It was that mother  I know exactly  I'm glad we fired them  But you listen to that  It's obvious 
[02:59:30]  That you know what  The fucking guys were sloppy  And good for you  To smash them  The guys get shirts  Yeah  I think the payout for me  Was I got a call from  Koppelman  He was a writer  On a movie with Pacino  I think it was  One of the Oceans 11  Or 12 or 13  And he needed to get motivated  Al did  And they wrote this scene  From shirts  And they fitted it to Al  And then they had Al listen  Pacino to shirts 
[03:00:00]  To get him to where he needed to be  That's great  And the guy called me  He says  Can we do that  I said  Shit go  I don't care  How did you balance  You're a great songwriter  But you also were  A really great performer  How  Was that a difficult thing  Of like  What stuff am I going to give  To other people  And what am I going to  How am I going to shine  On my own  Yeah good question  Because you know  It started  I wasn't sure  When the Beatles hit  What the future was  For a lot of us  Were you guys scared  When they first hit  I wasn't really scared 
[03:00:30]  Because my agent  Normie Weiss  Because I  You know  Back then there's no  We're not media  Okay  I'd come back  From France  And say  I had this croissant  Some people thought  It was like a car  And then I said  You went to  It sat on a B-Day  And they thought  It was a movie  Nobody knew  What anything was  And I'd come back  After meeting the Beatles  And tell people about them  And they would say  What  And I told my guy  Normie Weiss  Who went over  And brought them over  In 64  But the point was  Yeah things got  A little shaky  Because we got  Blown off the radio 
[03:01:00]  What kept me anchored  Was I'd had  The Tonight Show theme  The longest day  And then I packed up  And I went to Italy  And I started selling  Like millions of records  In Italian  And I had a career  Over there  And went to Germany  Did the same thing  So I didn't have  To be here all the time  So when it got  A little shaky  I realized that my writing  Was the most important  Right  And then as I  Stayed in Vegas  And the Gravitas  Remained from Vegas  Watching those guys work  I started to grow  Into myself as a performer 
[03:01:30]  It didn't happen right away  Right  You know I held my own  But it didn't happen right away  So this is like  Late 20s  Early 30s  Yeah  Probably my mid 20s  Mid 20s  Yeah going into my 30s  And at some point  It just clicked  That I knew  What I was doing on stage  And I'd learned enough  Yeah  But I always felt  That the writing  Was the most important  But I never wanted  To keep it  Always for myself  Because I felt  Insecure about  Wait a minute  How can I go  And have a record  Out every 3 months  And why should  Paul Anka be on the radio  Every year  For the rest of my life  So it was Tom Jones 
[03:02:00]  It was giving stuff away  Wow  Because it kept  That other side  Of my life  Yeah  Out there for people  And it's what I enjoyed doing  Because I started  As a writer  As a writer  Yeah  I started singing my stuff  Because nobody wanted  To sing it  People sing  I'm so young  And you're so old  I mean  The first line alone  Will turn you off  I'd love to sing that  To my co-workers  How close were you  To growing your hair out  Though  And following the  Following the trend  Well Bobby did it  You know  Yeah  That's right  He really left  And we talked about it  And I felt  I said  You know Bobby  Look you're a great artist 
[03:02:30]  And he could probably  Do anything  But it was just  A jolt to everyone  I didn't really feel  Motivated  Because I was satisfied  With the vibe  That I was in  The niche that  Was really still  Working for me  And I never felt  That I wanted  To compromise myself  Just for the sake  Of what was happening  Because when you compromise  I mean even with the book  You compromise  Because you want  People to like you  You never have  Any kind of progress  So I never believed  In that respect  And you guys were all  About the same age too  The Beatles 
[03:03:00]  And Bobby was a little older  Yeah  The Beatles and the Stones  And those guys  Were around my age  You know  A couple of them  Are a couple of years  Yeah give or take  A few  But within range  Yeah  Absolutely  Can you talk about too  I was flipping through the book  At every page  There was something interesting  I'm not being polite  It really was unbelievable  And I landed on  When you were talking  About meeting with Sinatra  For one of the last times  You saw him  Which was a dinner  You guys had together  Yeah  And can you talk about that  Because it was really interesting 
[03:03:30]  One of his regrets  Well  You know  I always loved  Being in his company  He was  A very warm human being  And he loved his friends  And he was always a lot of fun  And near the end  Obviously  It wasn't all working  And we were all touched  By that  And I had dinner  With he and his wife  Barbara  At the MGM  Where he was working  And  Somewhere during the course  Of the meal  He said  You know  I've really got 
[03:04:00]  One big regret  And he said  I always wanted  To do the  Marlon Brando part  In The Godfather  He said  I called everybody  I tried to go in  And audition  That should have been  Me doing that  Nobody felt that part  Like me  And you know  I couldn't get  Anybody to listen to me  But he wanted  To play The Godfather  Wow  That's such an odd  Thing to look back on  Yeah  I guess everybody  If you're going to  Regret something  Not playing The Godfather  That's pretty good  Regret  That's not a bad  One to have  I regret that 
[03:04:30]  I didn't bang that  Five  In Connecticut  That's like a real  And Annette Funicello  Passed away  And you were close  Sad sad sad day  Yeah we were close  She was part of our  Young teenage scene  Back then  You know  She came out on tours  She was huge for Disney  America loved her  You know  She was the one  You know  She was just that  Girl next door  Yeah  And they put her  On tour with us  And you know  Obviously there's me 
[03:05:00]  And Frankie Avalon  And Fabian  And you know  We're teenagers  It's not about the money  It's the women  Yeah  And everybody loved her  And anyway  I started writing for her  She was very shy  About singing  Even though she could  But she really had  Somewhat of a  I'm not sure  And I kind of helped her  Through all of that  Wrote an album for her  But she was a very  Professional  Dedicated  Family woman  You know  Her mother would  Travel with her 
[03:05:30]  Everything that she did  Was she would study  And want to do good  And I had some  Great great times with her  I mean she was  We talked about marriage  Obviously I couldn't do it  She didn't want to do it  Well she wanted to do it  But knew that it wasn't  Going to work  Because Disney  And everybody around her  Were just all over us  That it was a puppy love  Thus I wrote puppy love  You know her and I  Because they kept  Pounding it  Into our heads  But it was a great loss  You know she was  Very courageous 
[03:06:00]  And when she  Found out about MS  Very quickly  Post of that  She stepped forward  And really shared it  With a lot of people  To give them  Some kind of  Sense of what it was about  To give them some hope  To give them some education  If you will  On it  But loved Annette  Loved her family  Just good people  My agent at the time  Jack Gilardi  Another great guy  He married her  Had some wonderful children  Very successful  And it's a great loss 
[03:06:30]  You know you're never  Ready for it  Even though you  Hate to see people suffer  When that door  Really closes on anyone  You hate to see it  Because something inside you  Closes  You know I  I just  Feel that God  Is now  Got a lot of people  Bowling in my bowling alley  You know  They're just going down  And she'll be missed  She was a very special girl  You had all girls yourself  I had five girls  Five girls  Wow  I had a Catholic woman  With bad rhythm  And then I got a son recently 
[03:07:00]  Oh recently  Yeah well  Seven years ago  Wow  And he's something else  Changed my life  And takes the focus  Off of you  And you put it into  A beautiful little human being  Children are where it's at today  I gotta tell you  Yeah  I feel very blessed  To have that little boy  In my life  Is there anything you regret  Because Sinatra talked about  Bad  Is there anything you look back on  And I'm sure we all have them  But is there anything  You look back on  That's kind of been  A thorn for you  That you're like  I wish I would  Done that a little better  Yeah  I think we all have regrets  You know  You feel funny talking about it 
[03:07:30]  When you've been given so much  Sure  When that balance  Is so to the right  To sit down  And start regretting stuff  In abundance  To me  It's just kind of  Ungrateful  You know  Yeah  There's things that you've done  There's business moves  That you've made  You wish you hadn't made  But you know  Shit happens in life  To all of us  And you can never  Really see what's coming  You know  My whole approach to that  At a young age  Was try and see problems  Coming before they get there  And you alleviate all of that 
[03:08:00]  You know  Big regrets for me  Were losing my mother  You know  I could do nothing about it  She was my ally  She'd give me money  She worked at Sears Roebuck  So I could get my music  You know  Back then  They didn't know  About all this  American Idol stuff  So she was the one  That stuck by me  And you know  At 18  She died  In her mid-30s  And you know  I couldn't quite  Grasp all of that  That was tough on me  And then later on  Some business things  That went down  But nothing that I  To really talk about  You know  I can say they're out there  And there is stuff there 
[03:08:30]  But is it embedded in me  Nah  You know  When you got it going  And you're still going  And you're doing it  You kind of look back  The good thing I look back on  Is you know  We learned to fail  Back then  You can't fail today  Yeah  You guys do a stretch here  And fail for three months  You got trouble  You know  In my business  Back then I could fail  And I could go on stage  And do my thing  And you learn from that  Today you can't  You know  Today you can't  That's why I feel fortunate 
[03:09:00]  Coming up when I did  Because I really learned my craft  You know  You go in a studio  With a band  And that's the record you got  You know  Today you sit around with  You know  112 tracks and equipment  Right  You take three years  And you want to sound like this guy  Press this button  You know  It's all  A whole different  So it's not  So it's not just romantic  And whenever I look at  All that era  I get so jealous  I'm like  That seems like  A great time  To have been in show business  You see guys going on  The Tonight Show  You see guys going to Vegas  Oh  It really was that good  It was 
[03:09:30]  Yeah  It was  But you had  Work  There was stuff  Right  To get there  Was it as crucial  Was it  As severe  As it is today  No  It was easier  Yeah  You know  Smaller group of people  There was a  Everybody had a camaraderie  About them  Everybody had protectionism  About each other  And it was cool  With those guys  And they were loose  And it was real stuff  Yeah  It wasn't technology stuff  I'm not against  Technology at all 
[03:10:00]  But I just think  It has its plus  And its minuses  But back then  You had to be that good  You had to be that funny  You had to be  Because you were alive  Right  And people kept secrets  Back then  It was like  You could have these  Wild Rat Pack nights  And all this stuff  Yeah we did  But it's like  You know  You look at now  It's TMZ  It's a matter of  Let's see  You can snap a cell phone  A photo of somebody  Doing something wrong  And then put it out there  And back then  These guys just didn't have that  It was like  You guys would hang out  And do what you did  It wasn't a media driven society  We'd get in that steam room  I mean  Forget about it  It was  I mean 
[03:10:30]  Who's coming through the door  Now  And how many  And it's fun  You know  It was guy fun  There was nothing wrong with it  Right  Everybody gets all wrapped up  In a mob  And what were they like  They were great guys  You know  They were gentlemen  They spoke softly  If you didn't get out of line  Nobody bothered you  We shared  Shared women  We shared laughs  It was just a great time  Yeah  That's great  You didn't get out there  Thus we continued to do it  Right  Unfortunately today  They're watching all of us  In many ways 
[03:11:00]  Yep  And you gotta regulate your life  And adjust it  Because people are getting destroyed today  Their lives are getting destroyed  Yeah  Their occupational vibe  Is getting destroyed  Because they don't know  How to deal with  That kind of criticism  And some of them are too young  To know how to compute it  You know  So you're destroying more people  And the chance for them  To grow and emerge  Than yesterday  When you went through  All that stuff  And it was good human stuff  And then you went on  With your lives  Yeah  Everybody wasn't so critical 
[03:11:30]  Today  Everybody's got an opinion  I know  I mean opinions  They're like assholes  Everybody has one  I mean everyone has an opinion  About something  You watch these shows  With these judges  You know  And you have to fill the time  Half of them don't know  About music  Right  Yeah  And they're feeding these kids  You're a superstar  You're a superstar  Kid needs Vaseline up their butt  They're so nervous  He can be a superstar  Does the technology bother you  And just audio 
[03:12:00]  Just listening to music  The compression of digital music  Does that bug you at all  Or you think it's purely  No I'm a today guy  I appreciate everything  From yesterday  I really get the technology  And I use it  To it's best benefit  Right  And it's worked for me  In a lot of things  My new CD  You know  I've got Frank Sinatra on there  Yeah  I've got Michael Jackson on there  Wow  I mean I've got guys on there  Because of the technology  It's called duets  Right  Yeah the duets  And we've got Willie Nelson  And Dolly Parton  And Michael Buble 
[03:12:30]  And you know  A lot of it  Because of the technology  We're able to have  All those people there  Right  You know like  If I speak to Buble  He's in his studio in Vancouver  And I'm in LA  Right  And we're making the record  Wow  So the technology  When it works is great  But it doesn't bother me  When I know it's been used right  Right  And I know a lot of people  Are going back to vinyl  And I love that sound  Right  And it's honest shit  I mean that stuff  Yeah  You go in a studio  You write the notes  And you get three hours to get it  And people work hard  And it's honest  And it's real 
[03:13:00]  Yeah  Technology is a whole other application  Right  You don't like when it makes up for  I'm sorry  You don't like when it makes up for  A lack of talent  Or a lack of work  You like when it's just  It adds  It makes things more convenient  Exactly  Are we talking about auto-tuning?  Yeah  Well you know  A lot of these singers out there today  And they'll go nameless  Because I don't rep my fellow artists  You know  They can't really sing  You know  And that helps them  And gets them where they're at  But you've got to live by that  So you go and lip-sync in concert  And that in itself  Is a whole other  Right  Drives me nuts 
[03:13:30]  Watching lip-sync  I watched McCartney  We did the Super Bowl  He didn't lip-sync  I know  He didn't lip-sync  When he sang at the Super Bowl  He sang  He used to be fucking nuts  He's dumb  He's running around lip-syncing  I love when the record skips  Oh it's just so great  That happened to me  On American Bass then  Really?  You had no choice  There's no bands  You go on and do your record  Right  So I'm doing Diana  And the guy's playing a record  Yeah sometimes you get a bad record  And I'm singing away  I'm scared to death  I'm 17  I love you with my heart  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh 
[03:14:00]  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Oh no  Uh-oh  What did you do?  What could I do?  I'm just looking around  Oh boy  Oh-oh  Oh-oh  Oh-oh  Hey  Did they fix it?  Yeah  It went from that  To the end of the record  Oh please  Wow  What was the girl  On the Saturday Night Live  The sister of Jessica  Oh god  The sister  Remember when  Not Jessica Simpson  Her sister  Oh yeah  Of course  Yes  Oh man  That happened to her  At a football game 
[03:14:30]  I think  It was on SNL  Oh it was  Oh absolutely it was  Yeah  It was humiliating  They're telling us  Paul has other press  That's too bad  I have just  Another great part  In your book too  Where you talk about  Dean Martin  Yeah  And seeing him  At the end  And it's just so sad  How this  This  You know  It seems like he broke down  After his son  Well his son died  Look  A loss of a child  Man  And you know  You don't even want  To go there  And  He was a cool guy 
[03:15:00]  I mean this guy  Forget all the drinking  And everything  This was a lot of  His apple juice  This guy would  You know  After the show  He'd go sit  In the little tent  Off stage  And eat a bowl  Of spaghetti  And watch a western  Go to bed  Or get up and golf  So he was a real  Cool relaxed guy  But after the sun  And then when Frank  Wanted them all  To go out on that tour  He didn't want to  Keep up  That late night stuff  Anymore  And he was just  Hurting inside  And I  I would go over  And see him  At this little restaurant  On Cannon  Called La Familia 
[03:15:30]  And he'd always sit  In the back  And I'd go with  A buddy of mine  You know  We knew him  And he'd be sitting  Right in the back  With his  You know  The pasta  And the booze  And his teeth were out  And they were right there  On the table  Sometimes in the glass  And he'd say  How you doing Dean?  And he'd say  I'm just waiting  To die, pal  Just waiting to die  Jeez  Yeah  He just  Couldn't recover  Just waiting to die, pal  And that was the last time  You saw him?  Well, no  I saw him after that  I saw him 
[03:16:00]  You know  Other restaurants  Near the end  But he was like that  At least the last  Couple of years  You know  And a nice guy  You know  All those guys  Sammy  Frank  Dean  They were really  Cool guys  You know  They were men's men  When they liked you  You know  They behaved  With that fun  Because they'd been  Given this incredible life  And even after  They all passed  And I remember  We were so sad  I said  Look on a happy side 
[03:16:30]  These guys have lived  The life  Of three guys  They lived  They lived like  They were 250 years old  But they lived  And they were honest  About it  Whatever they  Went into  That wasn't  Normal to others  It was what  They wanted to do  And there were  Great guys  To be around  All of them  They were gentlemen  They were really gentlemen  I can't really  Say as the kid  Growing up around it  And I benefited from it  That they did  Any bad stuff  They always got my vote  No matter what they did 
[03:17:00]  They just weren't  Malicious guys  I like taking photos  Of people I like too  And your photo collection  Just shits all over mine  You get the Beatles  And all this  And I love the  Jerry Lee Lewis  In 1958  Going to I think  Australia  Australia on a plane  You don't see many guys  With a photo with Jerry Lee Lewis  What kind of guy was he?  He was wild  Jesus  He didn't like me  I don't like him  Oh really?  Oh really?  Well we had an  Off and on thing  Right?  Because I was this young kid  Having hits 
[03:17:30]  And he was older  And he was pissed  And you know  He liked to drink  But he just didn't like me  And I didn't like him  So we went at it  We had a fight  At 35,000 feet  Over the Pacific  And then we'd roll back  To take a picture  And then he'd get after me  But it wasn't a  And I went down with him  And Buddy Holly  So he and I  Were off and on  Jerry  Wow  You knew Buddy as well?  Oh Buddy was my  Dear dear close friend  Oh really?  Yeah Buddy Holly  He and I were opening  A company together  A music company  Because he wanted to change 
[03:18:00]  And that's why  I wrote the song for him  It doesn't matter anymore  He had called me  With my manager  And said  I'm quitting with the group  Getting rid of my managers  I need some money  And we arranged that tour for him  Where the plane went down  But he and I  Would always get together  And just talk  He was such an influential guy  You know  When I met the Beatles  For the first time  They talked about Buddy Holly  Chuck Berry  Muddy Waters  These guys had influenced them  And Buddy was such a raw 
[03:18:30]  Talented guy  His music was just so clean  And we would talk about  Forming a business together  After he got his affairs  Straightened out  And we were going to have  A music company together  And when he called  And you know  I wrote the tune for him  And I said  Let's go to New York  Which is a big band  That was the first big band  With strings  And all that stuff  That he liked  That I was doing  With You Are My Destiny  And all that  And we went in the studio  Here in New York  And here was Buddy Holly  Coming off a three piece band  With a huge string section 
[03:19:00]  And all this shit around him  And he does  It doesn't matter anymore  Right  And it starts to climb up the charts  And then a few months later  I get that phone call  Just devastated  All this  Wow  Man oh man  What a talented dude  The book is  It's called My Way  By Paul Anka  And it's  I wish I had read the whole thing  I just didn't have time to  But what I've read is  Every page I turned to  Just to get like little notes  And discussion points  Was packed with something  That I wanted to read  And you start off 
[03:19:30]  Writing about Vegas  And it's just  It's fantastic  What I've read of this book  Thank you very much  I really really want to read  The entire thing  And you have a fascinating life  I think it's going to do well  I think it's going to do alright  I mean you can't  Even if you don't like  Certain kinds of music  You can't not be interested  In the lifestyle  That these guys  And I love the honesty in this  Well you know  That was a big decision  How open  And I cut the veins here  And I realized that  I'm not going to  Write a fluff book  I'm not going to get into  What Frank had for breakfast 
[03:20:00]  Or Frank Yavill and I  Had a cannoli contest  In Wildwood  Who cares  You know  You're ultimately  Maybe stepping on some toes  And I hope not  But I wanted to be  Very honest about  What my experience was  And the message in there  With all of that honesty  Of what I saw  You know  I mean you have to remember  There's always a lot of hearsay  And there was a lot of hearsay  About the mob  And Frank  And all that  But I was there  And the message in all of that  Is they as in myself 
[03:20:30]  Were just human beings  You know  And don't stand in judgment  Because I'm not a judgmental person  But however we carried on  Or however they carried on  Or the things that happened to me  In my life  That affected me  This is the honest facts  In terms of where we're at today  As a society  We're all crying out  For honesty  And what's true  From the country to this  And I see a lot of people  That have come out there  And just bullshit  And write fluff  And you know  Come in and you guys  Have to suck it up  And deal with it 
[03:21:00]  And I figured  You know what  They're not going to take  Any signs down  In Hoboken about Frank  He's going to go down  As one of their greatest sons  And he gave to charity  In the billions  And he was a great guy  And a great artist  And everything I say in there  Is about love  For him  Sammy  Everyone that I write in there  But it had to be  The truth for me  Or why do it  And if you don't do it  You got a book  This thin  And you got your one shot  Of writing a book  And at my age  I figured  You know  A couple of people get pissed 
[03:21:30]  Because they really  Don't understand it  That's their fault  Right  You know  I'm not going to sit  And tell lies  And leave stuff out  And have people go  Well anyway  We heard  You know  Because I'm accessible  But a lot of guys  That write these books  About these people  Or those times  They're on the periphery  They've never left  Their little hometown  And their gathering material  I was there  Right  I was on the 50 yard line  I was in the locker room  I saw it  I smelled it  I did it  So I'm going to tell  And you're able to write it  You're a really good writer  What a great interview  Yeah  This was great  Our show is over 
[03:22:00]  Love your show  I'm listening to your show  Thanks Paul  I appreciate it  Great Paul Anka  It's called My Way  And also  The CD  Is called  Paul Anka Duets  And it's the same cover  On both  It almost looks like  They're purposely  Annie Leibowitz  I've got to tell you  She did a great job  Ah that's Annie Leibowitz  Annie Leibowitz  Cover  She's so talented  And what a lovely woman  I loved working with her  Wow  And her contribution  Was just great  And her photo  In the Vanity Fair piece  She's just a very talented  Human being 
[03:22:30]  I have to thank her  And everybody  At St. Martin's  And Sony  They've been an incredible team  You know I've always said  That success has many fathers  I've got a lot of good people  Around me  That really have brought  This to fruition for me  Rob you certainly did it right  And I'll say for the record  In closing  That Paul is probably  The best smelling guy  We've had here in a long time  It's unbelievably good stuff  Whatever  I wanted to ask you  When you came in  But I figured  That might just have a weird tone  With my girlfriend  Because we were like  Hanging out real heavy  Until this morning  And I guess 
[03:23:00]  We will see everyone tomorrow  Absolutely  The great Paul Anker  Thank you Paul  Thank you man  I'll keep listening  Love it  And hope he feels better  If he's listening  Right on  Glad you weren't here today  The Opie and Anthony show  Is pretty much over  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is  After O&A Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Yes yes yes 
[03:23:30]  Say that again  Were you at the after party  No no no  I wish  That was hilarious  It's after Opie and Anthony Live  Brendan Burns is here  You remember Brendan Burns  Hey  How you doing  He was in with  Mick Foley  How long ago was that  It was a while back  Yeah yeah  Hey can I get a water  Because I just had a Red Bull  On an empty stomach  And I'm a bit shaky  Can we make this happen  Interns  That was a bad move  Can we make this happen  Huh  Are we on the air  Alright  Yeah we are  You've tricked me again 
[03:24:00]  Have I  I'm good like that  So you're going to get  Such a kick out of this  Yeah  We started the Fandango thing  Last night  Okay so  We ruined matches  Last night  I don't know if you ruined them dude  That was the  One of the most  Last night  You're not going to believe me  Get my kid on mic  Luke come in here  Is that okay  Of course it's okay  Luke's welcome to join the show  I should stress  Luke is 13  So he will undermine  Any lie I tell  You tell the truth a lot Luke  Oh really  No you don't  Sometimes you like  Wait a bit  Phil undo any exaggeration  I can't say 
[03:24:30]  Last night  We played the clip  On O&A today  Fandango  The weird thing was  And I think it might be  There's just  An insane  Intense energy  To this crowd  On Monday Night Raw  Last night  You always have to go  To the Raw afterwards  Because everyone's hung over  And giggly  And feeling slightly sarcastic  And it's all the dumb  Wrestling fans  That are showing up  Like Wrestlemania  Like you know  All the like  Hollywood types  And people that might  Not be wrestling fans  Are at Wrestlemania  But at Raw 
[03:25:00]  I would argue against that  Because it's actually  All the foreigners  Because everyone gets it  With the travel package  So it was all  Here's what happened  But it's all the foreigners  That are big wrestling fans  There is a weird  Bizarre Venn diagram  That I've now tapped into  Of wrestling fans  And stand up fans  So they all came to  The Foley show  When we toured Australia  We were in massive theaters  That's crazy that you  And Mick Foley were touring  Because the thing  That people don't know  About Brendan  Is that like  Here in the States  Everybody's like  Oh Brendan  Oh okay yeah  Yeah I guess I know 
[03:25:30]  Maybe  But in the UK  And in Australia  You're famous  No I'm not famous  How many people  Know who you are  No dude  I'm so painfully unfamous  I recognize the audience  Is that right  Yeah  You're like oh  I remember you  From the last show  And they're like  I don't  I don't remember you  I get blanked  I get blanked  You've been on television  Before  You've made a career  For yourself  The British version  Of the Daly show  But I got sacked  Pretty soon  You got fired from that  And I walked off  The set of  Help I'm a Celebrity  Why'd you do that  I was the host  Because I hated it  Well yeah 
[03:26:00]  But I mean  You could have just  Stayed  You could have  Used the cash  No  It was terrible  They put a call  You quit live  On the air  Yeah  It was  Me working with  Kelly Osbourne  And interviewing people  Like Tara Palmer  Tonkinson  And I'm not allowed  To ask them  The only question I want  Which is  So what's the  Fucking point of you  Ever  Is that  Who is this  Oh she's like  Is she like  Girls  Kim Kardashian  Who has no septum  Left from cocaine  Yeah  He's 13  Don't worry  He knows  He knows  He's 13  Not retarded  So you quit 
[03:26:30]  You quit that show  Live on the air  Yeah I did  How'd that happen  They put a cork hat  On my head  What's a cork hat  Well that's a bit  Well that's a bit like  Giving a black guy  A spear  Oh  An Australian  Like the swinging  Corks to keep  The fly down  Of your eyes  Gotcha  Like a little  Like that might  As well give you  Like the crocodile  Dundee thing  Yeah so some  Reality star  Muppet  Stuck it on my head  But that was  The inspiration  Because I was offended  And then I wrote  A show about  The nature of a fence  Which won me  The Perrier  Which is like  The  On the international  Circuit  That's like  The Oscar 
[03:27:00]  For stand up  I thought they gave you  A drink  They were like  Here's a seltzer water  Here's a Perrier  You won buddy  Way to go  Well it got boycotted  Because it was owned  By Nestle  Although people claim  They boycotted it  They boycotted it  After the nominations  Came out  Oh I see  I see  So alright  So there's a little  History  So here we go  So yes I digress  So there's a weird  Venn diagram of  Wrestling fans  Stand up fans  That at Wrestlemania  I was there with  Rove McManus  Who's like the  Jay Leno of Australia  Okay  So he was with us  So they recognized Rove 
[03:27:30]  But they recognized me  From the Foley shows  Oh all the wrestling fans  Because they were over there  All the Australian wrestling fans  Know you  Because the ringside  Is filled with people  That bought the travel packages  Early  So it's all English  And Aussie fans  Is that what you did  Or are you there  As a freebie  Yes I did yeah  You're a real wrestling fan  Oh absolutely  Good good  I'm a proper mark  Good  Yeah  I love that  It was funny  Like Rove and I  Were at the after party  And we kind of had to go home  And take our shirts off  First  Oh because you had  Like wrestling shirts on  Yeah  That's funny  And because we know  A few of the guys  Obviously through Mick  Yeah 
[03:28:00]  And Mick got inducted  So he had plenty of passes  This year  Yeah  So he took us all along  And  But it was really weird  Because a lot  You know  I'm now like  I've got this weird demographic  As the wrestling comic  And a few of the guys  Knew me  And marked out  But that's weird though  Because  How long were you a comic  Before you were a  I've been doing this for 23 years  And I've been doing  Wrestling stories  For about a year and a half  I came out about  A year and a half ago  And now you're  The wrestling comic  And well  It's kind of a part time thing

[03:29:00]  I make people feel  Very comfortable  And at home  Every time I come in here  Do they  Which is a testament  To how laid back you are  Yeah  But also  How grossly unprofessional  Yeah  Nobody's  Nobody's taught us anything  Paul Anker  Guess what  Yeah  I think I'm doing man cow  When I go to Chicago  Uh oh  Are you gonna  I don't know  Well the thing is  If it gets me in with you guys  I'm willing to burn  Every bridge in America  Yeah yeah yeah  Oh me too  Can I burn some bridges  If you can get on man cow  And like shit on him  A little bit  We did man cow  I actually did man cow 
[03:29:30]  When I was doing season one  Oh  That's a  I'll tell you  It's an interesting  It's a different format  Kind of thing  You kind of really  Don't even know  What's going on sometimes  Is he just like  Pointing at you  And go go go  Bringing mites up and down  I did the phone call  So it was like  You had all these sound effects  Going in and out  And everything  And dude  Helicopters going on  So I had no idea  What was going on  And you're like  I'm trying to have a conversation  I know  I thought we were just people here  But  Exactly  This is weird  Who's this book  This is DJ Who Kid  Jordan  Dude you're not amazing  Alright  This is Jordan 
[03:30:00]  He's a toy hunter  10 in the morning  Don't I have a fucking toy hunter  Of course  This is Brandon  Smell this bloke  He's a comedian  He stinks  Smell this man  What do I smell like  Do I smell like a wanker  And this is DJ Who Kid  He smells edible  Very nice  We got a lot going on today  He smells edible  I was eating pussy this morning  We're talking  No come on  We're trying to talk about  You know  All kinds  We're trying  There's a 13 year old in the room  Who can  Oh I'm sorry  Are you  Oh well you're 13  Well you're English too  So it's like  You guys mature

[03:31:00]  And wherever it is  Conventions  Yeah that they keep  Massive amounts  Of toys  Yeah it's on Travel Channel  I watch it all the time  We're like the highest rated show  On Travel  Well not exactly  I've got  You can't really say that  When you have someone  From Travel Channel  In the room  I talked to  I talked to Bert Kreischer  I talked to  You're all trying to beat  Man vs. Food  Let's be honest  Nobody on that channel  Can defeat Man vs. Food  Well actually we can't  Because he's not even on anymore  Oh  He's not  No Man vs. Food  Is not on anymore  Adam Richman's still around 
[03:31:30]  Everything  But Man vs. Food  So technically  I am beating him  Because he's not on  That's right  He said  He said he had to stop  Doing the show  Because he was like  His body was falling apart  Or something  He couldn't  He couldn't physically do it  Well here's the thing  It's just like  You go around  You eat like nine cheeseburgers  Every day  Eventually  This shit's going to catch up to you  No we need to get another take of it  We need to pile up the burgers again  I don't know  Are you a wrestling fan?  Every now and then  Yes  I don't know if you saw this  But Brendan's  I'm a giant wrestling fan 
[03:32:00]  Brendan's a giant wrestling fan  Who Kid is in and out sometimes too  I used to sell toys to a lot of the wrestlers  Remember the Hardy Boys?  Matt and Joe Hardy?  Matt and Jeff?  Yeah Matt and Jeff  That wasn't the 70s  That was the 90s  The Hardy Boys  The Hardy Boys  No the wrestlers  Oh god damn it  Who Kid  What are you talking about the show?  Yeah  No they're huge Spider-Man fans  So I would sell to them all the time  So what did the Hardy Boys buy?  Spider-Man  Oh oh oh  All on Spider-Man toys  And the thing is  I'll show you what a bonehead I am 
[03:32:30]  Matt's like  Matt's like  Oh there's another guy  On who I wrestle with  You gotta get in touch with him  His name's Dwayne  I'm like  Oh okay  He goes  Here's his number  He wants you to call him  And like an idiot  I lost the number  It was Dwayne Johnson  No way  So I'm like  I gotta call him now  But how am I gonna get in touch  With Dwayne Johnson?  Yeah I don't even think  The Hardys can get in touch  With Dwayne Johnson anymore  But you know what?  Travel Channel  Get in touch with Dwayne Johnson  You think you guys can pull that off  At the Travel Channel?  Sure  Oh boy I don't know  He didn't even look up  Yeah he's like

I never saw a toy in Australia  Yeah  No we're out killing our dinner  Let's uh  Some caller 
[03:34:30]  I'm not going to go to him  But Bill in Philly has a great suggestion  This is how professional we are  Let's go around the room  And give out our Twitter handles  So everybody can  Oh okay  Yeah follow me on Twitter  At Jordan Hembrough  That's H-E-M-B-R-O-U-G-H  No one really knows how to spell my name  So it's at Jordan Hembrough  And he's the toy hunter  On the travel channel  That premieres tomorrow night  Tomorrow night season 2  9pm  Eastern Standard Time  And uh  Brendan Burns  B-R-E-N-D-O-N  And everybody knows  B-U-R-N-S  No I'm at Gotham tomorrow  Oh you'll be  Gotham on Wednesday  So you're at Gotham on Wednesday 
[03:35:00]  And you don't come  And you're not in town very often  Uh no  And I'm at Laugh Factory in Chicago  Thursday, Friday  Okay and then of course  DJ Who Kid  He's always got his bullshit going on  DJ Who Kid of course  I'm doing a show with Colt  At Edinburgh Festival as well  You know Colt Cabana  Colt Cabana  Yeah  Oh that should be exciting  I'm staying at his place  Um  I should have brought my toys up here  I suck  Is it a  Are you  When you say  Are you doing wrestling comedy shows  Like you were saying  Or are you doing comedy comedy  No no I just don't want me to stand up set  So it's kind of funny  Because I wanted to squeeze some stuff  And my director kind of goes  You know there's going to be a time 
[03:35:30]  When you want to separate these two worlds  Yeah  Oh I never finished the story  Right  So I'm there with Rove McManus  And uh  At Wrestlemania  Yeah  And there's loads of Aussies and English guys  And I did a bit in the show  About heckling the great Carly  And making him break character  Okay  Where just if you want  You know you want to get attention  To the wrestling  Just affect the posh English accent  Right  So I was like  Sir  Sir  I'd just like to stress  We are not booing  Because of your  Effective heel psychology  We are booing sir  Because you are simply awful  So the short version of the story 
[03:36:00]  Is eventually  I kept on doing that  We're in the front row of the O2  Until the great Carly  Back when he was supposed to not speak  And or understand English  And the great Carly  Is this giant 7 foot 8 Indian dude  I mean this is everything  Right  And he was wrestling Carlito  Carlito went to go off the top rope  And uh  So  But the great Carly  Was over the other side of the ring  Nowhere near him  So they stood there  In a packed O2 arena  Just giving each other  A thousand yards stare  And in the silence  I picked a gap  And went  Exactly what was supposed to happen 
[03:36:30]  At which point  The Carly  Who was  The great Carly  Who wasn't supposed to speak  And or understand English  Turned to me  And went  Oh fuck off  He did  Yeah yeah yeah  That's awesome  He's the big dude from  He's in the longest yard  Yeah so the bit was kind of  That guy is huge  Yeah that's the guy  He's like a house  That's the guy  So the bit's become  The bit itself has become  Semi famous amongst like  These people who went to the show  Right  So we were at Wrestlemania  And I stood up and started  Sir  I didn't even get it out  And then like a good third 
[03:37:00]  Of the room in front of us  Just turned around and went  Holy shit it's Burns  And then  But then they looked to my right  And they go  Jesus Christ  It's Robert McManus  So I was  How are you going to handle this then  Because trust me  I've learned from this show  And I don't know if you guys realize this  But wrestling  Professional wrestling  It couldn't be more polarizing  People either  Love it  And they want you to only talk about it  Right  Or  They hate it  Right  The minute you bring it up  It's crap  It's all fake  Yeah yeah yeah  That's why we only do it  At the Foley shows  Like Mick and I learned real fast 
[03:37:30]  Yeah  That the audience  If you  I mean I was doing  Tried and tested bits  That I've been doing for two decades  And the crowd don't get mad  They get sad  Because the wrestling stuff  Killed so much  The opening line  Which is just a shit opening line  It was like oh  You know what  I'm glad to be here  Performing in front of wrestling fans  Because I don't have to do any backstory  Or any explaining whatsoever  When I say  I declare  If you're a straight guy  And you're a Randy Orton fan  You're fucking gay  And the place  Went nuts  For three reasons  Number one 
[03:38:00]  They get the joke  Number two  They understand that I understand the joke  And number three  They go  Oh wow  We really are just going to talk about wrestling  Right  Whereas  Whereas if you come on this show  And you just  If that were just like  Hey  And you started doing your Randy Orton jokes  Everybody would be like  Oh yeah  Tapping the mic  Go away  What are you doing here  It's so glee filled  It's such a weird kind of secret handshake  Yeah  But then you go to the wrestling  You have to be ringside  Because that's where people have travelled from around the world  And they're kind of slightly sarcastic  There's a bit more 
[03:38:30]  There's a bit more fun in the room  Yeah  But then like last year  We were up in the rafters  They took three of our signs off us  What did they say  We hate the we hate senior guys  Last year we saw three of them spill beer on a baby  And I think they saw the words spill and baby  And it was gone  Yeah  That's it  And if Fandango actually wrestles  We riot  They took that away  No they were cutting away from that  Oh I see  It was a bit too snarky  I see  Maybe  And what about the  What about the  Wait pass me  Let me see  Oh who kid wants to show me 
[03:39:00]  What he's been up to  What  Oh  What were you doing  Where'd you meet Layla  From WWE  I party I DJed last night  At Catch  Oh yeah  There you go  She has a nice big mouth  That's not  That's not  That's not  Real DJ who kid  That's why he spells  Not  She's got some guns on her  That chick's working out  And arms  Can I pass it around the table  She actually had the first Hulk Hogan toy too  She was  The toy world is not dissimilar to that  I feel like people either 
[03:39:30]  If they're not toy collectors  Yeah  They very much look down on those who aren't  They don't get it  I mean it really is  Especially people  I got to tell you something  I've been doing this 25 years  People still don't understand  What the hell I do  Yeah  And it  You know  It's like toy dealing  And toy collecting too  I mean it really is a passion  Do people assume you're a pay dog  Yeah probably  That's it  Well that's what I was going to say  Like I still collect wrestling toys  Oh yeah  It's huge  But I've been accused of  Being a man child  Being a pedophile  Being a 
[03:40:00]  I mean  People assume  Right  That I can't please my wife  Right  He touches you  You tell me  No matter what  Yeah I'm inviting 13 year olds on the show  I mean it's terrible  But yeah I mean  People literally  They think you're a pedo  Have they seen your computer  No  They hack it in a flash drive  I hang out with Chris Hansen  But  They assume I can't please my wife  Okay  You know  Which is terrible  It's nice  Because I can  I'm sure you can  Thank you Jordan  He's lying  I've got faith in you Sam 
[03:40:30]  Thank you very much  You and I  We hung out at New York Comic Con  Right  I know you can please your wife  We had a great time  Now  That was fun  Have I been yelling by the way  I just got my hearing aids playing up  No you're good  You're good  I don't even have my headphones on  You're good  I'm in control of this  Trust me  It looks like I have no idea what I'm doing  But I'm on top of everything in here  I'll keep my voice down  So  How do you kind of  Inform people on the fact that you are an adult  With a profession  And you make money  And you're a functioning human being  You know what it is  It's  You just 
[03:41:00]  You act normal  I mean the thing is  Is they actually  People realize that I can make a living off of this  I do have a house  I have a car  And I take a vacation  And you know  They realize  A guy's got to be getting his money from somewhere  I'm not knocking off banks or selling drugs  And it helps to have a TV show too  Once you get the TV show  It's like  Well he's the legit dude who's doing it  Yeah I think  I think the  You know  I think the TV show  I think Toy Hunter on Travel Channel  Added  Really this air of legitimacy to the whole hobby  Because people have been calling me  And emailing me saying 
[03:41:30]  You know what  Thank you  For making a show  That doesn't make us look stupid  Were you surprised that you got a season two?  I wasn't surprised  I was very grateful  Yeah  That I got season two  I truly hope that we go to season three  Because I do want to go overseas  We did okay  We did okay  We've got an extremely loyal following  Yeah  I think what it was  Is for a while  I think a lot of people were scratching their head first  Going  Travel Channel  Toy Hunter  Huh  You know  How do these guys go  But you know  I do travel all over the country 
[03:42:00]  That's what I'm saying  Like with the Travel Channel shows  As long as you're technically  Going to different locations  Right  It counts  And I mean  And I feel like  Like when I watch the show  Yeah  And I think a lot of people watch Toy Hunter  Just to be like  Oh I had that  That's exactly  That's all you do when you watch it  I had that  Oh He-Man  I had that  The toys are the star of the show  And then you go  And the thing is  I know that  I was like  I'm just  I'm the guy  Who like presents you the toys  The toys are the  Right  I'm the conduit  To the toys  You're there to let  Everybody at home know 
[03:42:30]  That that toy that your mom sold  At a garage sale  While you were at college  Is now worth $6,500  What?  That's it  That's exactly it  What's the most valuable wrestling toy  That you know of?  Because I've got to know  If I'm sitting on a goldmine or not  You know  I've got a lot of the prototypes  To the LJN ones  That weren't done  Because I got  I got  Really  Clients of mine  Who were sculptors  And painters at LJN  So I've got a lot of the  Wrestling toys that weren't done  You hook me up?  Of course  I'll do anything you want Sam  Hang on  Did you keep everything in the box and stuff? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah  I was an anal retentive kid  Uh oh  I'm tapping out  Are you tapping out?  That's a wrestling term  He's tapping out  Yeah  Eric  You're a toy  That's E-Rock in there  He's a big toy guy  To the point  What's up Eric?  To the point where like  Tell me if you think this is weird  Where's E-Rock by the way?  He's in there  Can I see how fat he is?  He's quite fat  Eric come in here  And show Brendan Burns  How fat you are  I'm not quite fat about fat  He's a guy  He's a fat guy  He better be part couch  No he's thick  He's like a black girl  He uh  That's it 
[03:43:30]  That's it  He's a toy collector  That's E-Rock  Yeah  What's up man?  You're not fat  I told you he's fat  That's not fat  That's fat  He's like a bitch  That's me with a month of no sit ups  He's thick  Would you call him a bitch?  No  Oh like a black chick  That's not fat  Well I mean it's like  E-Rock looks like a type of guy  Who should be skinny  Like he should be in shape  And so the fact that he's somewhat fat  Is like even more fat  You know what I mean? 
[03:44:00]  I've seen Norton be fatter than that  You've seen who?  Norton  I don't know if I've ever seen  Isn't Jim more bigger than you?  That is not fat  You like that Eric?  You guys are wankers  Jesus  I don't think so  Come on  You're wankers  Jesus Christ  That's offensive  I'm about to walk out of this show  It's cool you brought him in here  Because I want to know how much his toy is  The Mike Tyson autographed punch out  That's a good question  He's got a copy  I don't know if video games is your thing 
[03:44:30]  It's all my game  I do it all  He's got a copy of the punch out box  With Mike Tyson  Autograph  With the game  The instruction  Everything that came with it  You know the funny thing about that is  There's this great debate in the industry  Like whether autographs  You put on the toy  It actually devalues the toy  Or actually makes it worth something  Right  The punch out game is really not worth that much anyway  So  What?  Seriously  Yeah I know  God you guys are like all like  Damn  I just let you down  You'll blow up  Well you know why it's not worth anything?  Because you all said damn 
[03:45:00]  Because you all have one  That's why it's not worth anything  If Tyson gave you a piece of  Vanderholafield's ear that he bit off  That would be worth something  Can I tell you something?  I got a picture of Mike Tyson  Oh yeah  Biting my ear  Biting your ear  Can you think I can sell a picture of me  Getting my ear bit?  Probably  You know Tyson  You want to buy it?  He's starting to make a comeback a little bit  He's re-  You know he's poking fun to himself right now  He was great in the hangover  So Tyson  Tyson is not hot right now  The Tyson stuff  It's not really hot  I mean there's some intrinsic value to a boxing fan  Right  It's really cool  Is that because he is still prevalent? 
[03:45:30]  He's still alive  Because he's touring now  Oh  So I don't know what I mean  Right  He's gettable  Well because he's around  Yeah  So it's got to be someone like obscure  Like if you had like a  Well because then nobody might  A Steve Lombardi  Well nobody might care then  As opposed to a  It's actually got to be someone dead  You know  Yeah  I mean God forbid  If someone dies  Then it's like  Oh well he ain't going to be signing anymore  Or Ali  Because he's not  I mean the signature's shit now  He doesn't say that  He doesn't sign anymore  He's out here  Like you know who's tough to get?  It's funny  You want to talk about like a current actor? 
[03:46:00]  Yeah  Hang on you can't step on the Ali's  No no no  Let it go  If they got it  No please  I knew exactly  No go on  Who's  He's in boxing now  Who's  He's fighting  Who's the actor?  Harrison Ford's actually tough  Because he didn't sign anything  Really?  He doesn't sign anything  Holy shit  So like anytime you have anything from Harrison Ford  It's like worth a lot of money  Lucas too  George is tough to get there  Oh I got a signed thing  George Lucas  George Lucas  What do you have?  I got a lightsaber  What?  Signed by George Lucas? 
[03:46:30]  Hey do you know the Ewan McGregor story?  No  Okay  I mean I know  The guy that does the voice of Darth Maul  Is a comic  But this is  The guy who does the voice for who?  Darth Maul  Okay  He's a comedian  So this is how it got around the comedy circuit  So day one  They're shooting the lightsaber fight  George Lucas is never anywhere near the set  He's always over in a caravan  So they're shooting the lightsaber fight  And it's the first one  Ewan McGregor's done  And there starts to be like this weird snickering  And then it's just this bellowing laughter 
[03:47:00]  And then everyone on the set is cracking up laughing  So Lucas comes out of his caravan  And he walks up  And he just goes  What the hell is going on on my set?  And then the AD walks up to him  Whispers in his ear  And Lucas  Who apparently  You know  Is a very straight laced man  Cracks up laughing  And walks over to Ewan McGregor  And goes  Ewan  You don't have to make the noise  Yeah he did  Doesn't that make you love him so much?  He told me that too  That's crazy  Tell me if you think this is weird  E-Rock 
[03:47:30]  He's a man who's doing quite well for himself right now  Good for you  His wife is also doing well for herself  So they have a major dual income family  I mean he's got tons of cash  He's got just disposable income  You want to buy some toys?  I got some great stuff to sell you man  Not only does he want to buy some toys  Okay  But he is starting new toy collections at this point in his life  Really?  He's starting to do Legos  Yep  At 30  What are you 39?  No  Oh  Oh  He started like  A couple years ago  33 say  33 is when he started his Lego collection 
[03:48:00]  Now I get it  You're a fat fuck  Yeah  I mean  The hobbies are all encompassing of a fat 8th grader  It's kind of like  It adds to the fatness  There you go  You know  I'm not going to jump on board  I'm going to retract that  You think that's weird?  No  I mean you start  You're  You're not a kid  Are you trying to start a collection  Like learn everything again  Or just something new?  No  You know how some people read and do puzzles  And things like that  I just found it kind of relaxing  Just to  Other men learn 
[03:48:30]  How to satisfy a woman  Yeah  I mean it's fine  But those are the big projects  Worst things you can do  Yeah  I mean  Like the Death Star from Star  That  They'll take you like a month to complete  It's like 3,000 pieces  The Millennium Falcon  The Harry Potter Castle  Yeah you've got to remember  You're going to make a significant investment  Because those things retail at like $300  Yeah  I was going to ask you  Is there any money in like  Stuff now  Like it seems like  Yes  Everybody is aware  I'll tell you  Lego stuff goes up like crazy  Still  Yeah because you know what  Lego  They never have a sale  Ever  No  Lego never has a sale  And they're like  Guess what 
[03:49:00]  Here's the Millennium Falcon  You're going to make 500 pieces  And when they're done  They're done  I mean  They won't do it again  They don't make anymore  Right  So you know  You can look on eBay right now  And some auction sites  And you go under completed auctions  You see like Millennium Falcon  Is going for $1,000  Death Star is going for like $1,200  You're like holy mackerel  And you have to smash them up  And put them back in the box  That's it man  That's it  So when you go  When you have the toy  What do you do  What do you do  Do you just like put it somewhere  Or you hide it  Yeah what happens  After you make your Lego shit  What do you  It's on display  For what 
[03:49:30]  Are people coming over like wow  I still have the box  Alright there you go  Like you're displaying what  What do you have  I have Millennium Falcon  Cool  I have the extended Hogwarts  From Harry Potter  And that Harry Potter stuff  Is going to be gold in the future  Platinum huh  Are you laughing at him  Eric you got a 13 year old  Laughing at you right now  That's not cool man  He's like dude  I got a girlfriend  Yeah  Son give every man in this room  A fucking wedgie  Luke is your name right 
[03:50:00]  Yeah yeah  When did  Did you used to play with Legos  Luke  A couple of years ago  Yeah when did you  When did you outgrow  Your Lego collection  A couple of years ago  Probably about 10  Yeah  Okay  Now next question  Luke have you got  Check this out  Luke have you got a girlfriend  Yeah  There you go  Wow  That's the top  That's the man right there  What's your holy grail of toys  Right now  You know  The funny thing is  It changes every year  Right now I'm actually looking for  A roto jet gun 
[03:50:30]  From lost in space  Wow  1950  Wow  It's like a five  Five grand  Five or six grand  Yeah  I found a 1967 ideal Batman utility belt in the box  That was $12,000  $12,000 and you bought it  Yeah I had to find it for a client  1970  What did the client  1967  What was the markup on it  Flipped it for like a quick 15,000  I made a quick 3,000  Like that  Yeah  Have you ever bought anything like big  And then just been stuck with it 
[03:51:00]  All the time  Like what  You know what  I'm trying to actually  I'm trying to actually  It's funny  Maturity  Yeah  Maturity  Frigunity  I got stuck with it  No the funny thing is actually  I'm in the middle of  Selling this really expensive Star Wars set  Of action figures from England  And this guy bought them for like $17,000  And like he got halfway done paying  And all of a sudden he's like  Yeah I gotta hold off on payments  You know 
[03:51:30]  I kind of hit a hiccup  So I'm like  Dude  When am I going to get the rest of my money  Because he's like  Did you give him the set yet  I didn't give him the set  So what's going to happen is  I'm giving him 30 days  And I'm like  Look you know  It's non-refundable  What's up Rowan  You better get my money  Before I send the Wombles around  Yeah  Usually like  Instead of breaking his legs  I'll break the legs off the toys  Yeah  I have a limited edition Lego  I have one  One size  Indiana Jones  That's Rowan  One size Han Solo  I bought the Parade 
[03:52:00]  Was that a promotion?  Yeah  My friend's sister sent to me  She worked for Legos  You know what  Stuff like that is like gold  That stuff  The internal company stuff  Is worth a lot of money  Like years ago  They did a gold C-3PO  And like  I was at  Star Wars Celebration  Over in Los Angeles  And people from Lego  Were giving me  This like gold plated  C-3PO  They're like  Here it's in a bag  And I'm like  Okay  At the end of the show  A guy walked up to me  He's like  He wanted a Star Wars figure  Or something  And he's like  Will you trade  I got these  And he had like  Five of them in a bag  I'm like  Whatever 
[03:52:30]  And they were going  For like 200 bucks  Or something  Each  She gave me a whole  Star Wars set  They're each in a different bag  Brendan you look upset  Get that  Steven  You look upset  Brendan  What's troubling you  Let me talk to you  What's wrong with you  What do you mean  What's the problem exactly  It's toy talk  Yeah  It's like a commodity  I mean  But to be fair  To Jordan  Because I like  What you represent  And I like what everybody  Represents in this room  That's why I invited you all here  But you're getting mad  That Jordan's talking about toys 
[03:53:00]  Because you don't get to talk  About wrestling  It's like  It's like  Alright  Valid point  Alright  I'll wear that  Alright  And then  Who Kid's pretending  That he's 20  And still in the rap game  So we all have  We all have our problems here  Don't we  I got one last toy thing  Samuel Jackson  I spoke to him  For that Django thing  He's my nigga  You know  You slept it in that time  You did that on purpose  You know what I have  I have  I have the Django figure  Yeah that's what I'm searching  What do you got  They're supposed to come out with the toys 
[03:53:30]  You got a set  No I just have Django  Oh you just got Django  Okay  That would be  I actually did pitch that to Mick Follin  I think he went to Triple H about it  Nah serious?  Yeah I'm serious  That Django  Django would make a great wrestling character  A cool  Black cowboy  I mean yeah  Does anyone look cooler than Jamie Foxx  In that cowboy album?  It was cool  Is Django worth money?  Yeah  You know the funny thing is  I was  They banned it right?  Didn't they ban it?  They banned it  I can't sell it on eBay  I was sort of like  Intimately involved with this whole scenario  Because I was around  What was happening  Like  It was done by a company  NECA 
[03:54:00]  NECA  NECA  NECA  I thought you said NECA  So they're a great company  And they do Harry Potter toys  And they do Gremlins and everything  And what happened is  When all that negative connotation came about  And there was a big hubbub  They pulled them off the market  What happens is  They shipped a few  They actually shipped a few cases early  Some of them got them  Yeah I got one  That's how I got mine  Some got them early  Through Diamond and previews  But then what happened is  They took everything in the warehouse  And they destroyed them 
[03:54:30]  Or sent them back  Wow  But here's the crazy thing  The owner of the company  Is like  So fanatical about  Grabbing everything  He went to the employees  Because I had a friend of mine  Who was going to like  Hook me up with a case  And he's like  I need that case back  And he actually took the cases back  From all the employees  Wow  Now here's the caveat  What?  It was really really hot  For about a month and a half  Like everybody was insane  Like I want 10 grand  I want 80 grand  I want  Because it's when the controversy was hot  Right  It's cooling down  I was just at WonderCon in Anaheim 
[03:55:00]  A guy walked up to me  He's like  I have a set  Will you buy it?  I'm like how much?  He goes 2,000  I'm like nope  Because eventually  No one's going to care anymore  It'll calm down  They're always going to be rare  But the fact of the matter is  The figures aren't really  That well done  I don't really like them that much  I really don't think  They look too much like anyone  They look okay  You know what bothers people though  More than being stuck with toys  It's like  I don't know if you've ever been done this  But you know who can  Like you understand this problem  What?  Like you're looking in the mirror in the morning  Right? 
[03:55:30]  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  And you get all lathered up  And you put your shaving cream on  Uh-huh  And you're doing all this stuff  Brennan you know what I'm talking about  Spicy  And you realize  You forgot to buy razor blades  And you go  What?

[03:56:00]  It zombied out your face yesterday  It's terrible  The only thing worse is going through the garbage  And grabbing the old coffee filter  Right  Where you're like  I don't have a coffee filter  Wait, I think I got the one from yesterday  You know what's worse than that  Is grabbing your wife's lady razor  And using that instead  Because you don't know where that's been  I'm really fucking  This right here  I don't know if you use it in a magazine for toilet paper  Right  It was like  You don't know how to satisfy the missus  This right here  You call it the lady razor  Brendan  That's what I call it  Yippee  It's your Dollar Shave Club moment  Dollar Shave Club  Oh, I see  It's for guys who routinely forget to buy  Or simply
