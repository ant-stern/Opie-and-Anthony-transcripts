<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts—Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton—engaging in chaotic banter, filled with offensive jokes about "moral decay" and "pedophile humor," and boasting about their ambition to be the number one show, even among children with Down syndrome.  A caller, Smurf, relayed criticism from Bubba Bo’s XM radio show, claiming Opie and Anthony were demoted to a basic channel due to poor performance.  The hosts vehemently denied this, launching into a tirade of offensive insults and name-calling directed at Bubba Bo, portraying him as a failure and attention-seeker.  Anthony described his weekend of inactivity following a root canal and Vicodin consumption.

The segment continued with more attacks on Bubba Bo and a staunch defense of their show’s unapologetic style. They discussed fan-made content, including flash animations and photoshopped images. Anthony recounted winning a poker game despite intentionally playing poorly, thanks to his intern Nathaniel's reckless strategy. Anthony then shared a bizarre late-night encounter with a suspicious pizza delivery person, suspecting a scam or home invasion attempt. Opie followed with a terrifying account of a man entering his unlocked apartment while he slept in Buffalo, leaving Opie fearing a rape.  The discussion returned to Anthony's pizza incident and included listener calls, mentions of Howard Stern, and a New York Post headline about a "Brooklyn bigot arrested for mocking midget family," alongside complaints about technical microphone issues.

The show then focused on the New York Post article about Joseph Izzo, arrested for harassing his dwarf neighbors, Debra Shea and her daughter, Concilian, including painting a yellow brick road outside their home and mocking them with "Hi-ho, hi-ho." The hosts speculated about Izzo's motivations and the family's dynamics, frequently veering off-topic to discuss humorous headlines like those about Tonya Harding and Jenna Bush.  They also discussed a related article about Coco, the Killer Clown, a Coney Island performer and relative of the harassed family, who condemned Izzo's actions. The conversation drifted to Coney Island memories, old photos, and bathing attire.  They then discussed an HBO special about little people,  speculating on their daily life challenges, using crude humor to discuss their struggles. Caller anecdotes about working with assistive devices and further vulgar comments followed, before concluding with talk about show editing and a staff member’s allergy attack.  The language used throughout this segment was highly offensive.

A substantial portion of the show then centered around listener-submitted audio of a "midget" woman and her boyfriend, culminating in a marriage proposal.  The hosts extensively discussed the woman's appearance and the appropriateness of different terms for people of short stature, frequently using offensive language and comparing the use of the "N-word" and the word "midget." This transitioned into a planned "assault on the media" regarding the damaged Norwegian Dawn cruise ship's arrival in New York harbor, encouraging listeners to disrupt news coverage.  They also revisited a past show incident involving an upset midget stripper who cried during her performance, recounting the event with offensive jokes and expressions of guilt.  A call from Dane Cook detailing his tour mate Bob Kelly's football injury led to more vulgar humor.  A brief call from "Boston Strangler" reporting from the Boston Marathon was followed by a mention of scheduled guest Sean Rouse and brief mentions of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the new Pope's selection.


The next segment featured Sean Rouse (in-studio) discussing his rheumatoid arthritis, prednisone use, and continued drinking despite medical advice.  He also recounted a rushed preparation for a pilot shoot with Opie.  Opie, Anthony, and Joey Paisano (in-studio guest) then recounted a gambling trip to Atlantic City, focusing on Paisano’s extensive gambling, his wife’s intervention, and anecdotes about their experiences playing three-card poker and slot machines. Opie then shared a story about a comedy show in Dallas with Sean Rouse and Yoshi, highlighting the difficulties of performing for a rowdy crowd. The discussion shifted to wrestling-themed music, comparing Chris Jericho (a later guest) to Hulk Hogan, playing and criticizing songs from Hogan's albums, a Joe Pesci song, and surprisingly, a song by mentally challenged children.  Chris Jericho then joined the show, discussing his music career with Fozzy, his upcoming Wrestlemania appearance, his contract status with WWE, rumors surrounding his career, and played a Fozzy song.  A brief mention was made of a guest, Eric, under a gag order until Wednesday. Jim Norton’s pre-recorded comedic sexual education segment, "Your Body and You," was also mentioned.


The show concluded with a discussion of WWE wrestler Matt Hardy's situation—losing his girlfriend (Lita) and his job after Lita's affair with Edge.  This transitioned into a segment about vulgar comments from the website Whackbag, specifically a comment referencing "China's clit," leading to a lengthy, graphic discussion about clitoris size and sexual acts.  Chris Jericho returned to the studio to promote Fozzy's new record, "All That Remains," and his Madison Square Garden wrestling match, playing a portion of the song "Enemies" before the show ended.

[00:03:00]  This moral decay 
[00:03:30]  Huh?  Weakens our resistance  Dude  The enclosque of the communist masters of disease  We're a bunch of scumbags  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children  Jackass  I can't believe it  I can't believe it  Pedophile humor  It's depressing and horrendous  It's awful  It's a bunch of idiots  Perfect and proper  Here it comes! Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program  The Opie and Anthony  God that irritates me  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us  Opie  I want my coffee!  I want my coffee!  Anthony  I want that bath!  Jim Norton  I want Ozzy!  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with down syndrome children  Don't do it!  It's terrible  The Opie and Anthony show  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road! 
[00:04:30]  So well you know we don't have to freeze his whole body  We can freeze his head  We lack discipline  How are you?  Did you see that jerk?  Who is your daddy?  And what does he do?  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No! 
[00:05:00]  Howdy Quid!  It's in the hole!  No!  I think he said it was home  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Hey everybody!  We're all going to get laid!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Hey welcome to the Opie and Anthony program  It's going to make you sick!  You and Maura 
[00:05:30]  Shut up!  It's going to make you sick!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Morning!  I'm going to start again!  I'm going to start again!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program!  All my levels are all fucked up!  How'd that happen?  I don't know!  Somebody in here during the weekend?  I guess they had to be in here because all my levels were adjusted!  I know where my levels are supposed to be!  My levels!  Oh my god!  Where do we begin today? 
[00:06:00]  Plenty of funny stories in the news which we'll get to!  Oh my god!  I guess with the highlight story that had been laughing all weekend he said!  Yeah!  Well Saturday there was a little story in the New York Post.  We all brought the story in!  That's how obvious it was!  That's how obvious it was!  We'll get to that in a few minutes but we've got to talk about our weekends and stuff like  that!  Last we left you, Anthony was in extreme pain with the throes of pain. 
[00:06:30]  Well we found out you needed another root canal on Friday.  We did have to show from a dentist chair on Friday.  I had a root canal done like 12 years ago I guess it was and all the root wasn't out.  So the dentist had to go back in now and clean out the roots, refill them.  Oh!  So I had that done Friday afternoon.  And got a prescription for Vicodin.  Oh!  Dude, this stuff.  Nice, right? 
[00:07:00]  This stuff.  You can tell why the Betty Ford Clinic is just packed with people that are addicted to this  stuff.  Vicodin.  What's that?  Oxycontin is another one.  The other...  Kev's giving thumbs up.  And then that other one, Percocet or Percocet something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  So I've been taking these all weekend and just mellowing out.  It's a scream.  You take this thing and the first one I took, 15 minutes later I'm like... 
[00:07:30]  I couldn't function.  I'm just laying in bed.  And then the whole weekend was that.  Every four hours popping another and just being fucked up all weekend.  Do you realize that we had two really nice warm days this weekend?  No.  Not a clue.  I have no clue what the day was like, what the weekend was like.  No.  Just laid in bed.  Played poker.  Took drugs.  Slept.  That was it.  Watched TV.  That was it for you.  That's it.  God, we went to Atlantic City.  We did all sorts of fun stuff this weekend. 
[00:08:00]  You missed out on a lot of great stuff.  Yeah.  Not me.  Hold on.  We have to go to Smurf in Ohio real fast.  Smurf, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  I was listening to the Bubba Bo show on XM radio late Saturday night and they were really  trashing your show.  Why?  What show?  Bubba Bo.  It's on the Trucker Channel.  Bubba Bo?  Yeah.  Bubba Bo.  Well, you know, if you have a name like Bubba Bo, I think you should be trashing us. 
[00:08:30]  That's okay.  Okay.  I've never heard of Bubba Bo.  I've...  Yeah.  I thought that was...  Alright, whatever.  What was he saying?  Well, they were commenting on when Dragon Wagon had called in and, you know, how you guys  were trashing Dragon Wagon.  He was trashing Jim Norton and all and how Jim was going after him.  Then Bubba Bo was saying, well, you guys are a bunch of losers that you couldn't make  it on the premium, so XM radio had to put you on the basic channel. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, my God.  You know...  Aren't people saying we couldn't make it on the basic, so that's why we were on premium?  Because they want us to talk about them.  He's probably the guy...  Dragon Wagon is probably a part of that show or a friend or somebody on that show.  It's just probably a tie-in somehow with that show.  Well, here's a couple things.  You know, if we couldn't make it on the premium channel, they could have just fired  us.  XM is not firing the Open Anthony program anytime soon, okay?  Yeah.  So, I love the people that hate the show and they're like, well, obviously they took them off  the premium channel because they weren't getting any listeners.  Not true at all.  We got a ton of listeners when we were on the premium channel. 
[00:09:30]  We're not allowed to tell you how many, unfortunately, because I can prove my point in a second.  But I can tell you this much.  If we were complete failures at doing this show for XM, they would just fire us.  Don't you get that?  Uh-huh.  Well, he was trying to start a campaign with all the listeners.  Everybody ought to call XM to have you guys taken off or put back on a premium because  you're not appropriate to be on the basic channel.  Well, it figures that what he is is a cock blocker. 
[00:10:00]  Nobody's listening to him.  Dude, I've never heard of him.  We've been here since October.  I have never heard of his show.  Nope.  He's on 171.  He comes on Friday nights at midnight and Saturday nights at midnight.  Cross promotion.  Exactly, dude.  Friday nights at midnight and Saturday nights at midnight.  Yeah.  It sounds like XM has a lot of confidence in Bubba...  Bubba what?  Bubba Bo.  Bubba Bo.  Bubba Bo.  Yeah, he's a real anchor show to this platform.  Two shows, both starting at midnight.  He's a jizz bucket. 
[00:10:30]  Nobody knows him.  He can't make it.  And he's pissed off at Opie Anthony getting all the attention.  Who cares?  He's getting more exposure right now because we're talking about him than he does on his  own show.  And that's why he did it.  You know, you want to talk about someone that the company doesn't have a lot of confidence  in.  My God, if they had confidence in Bubba Bo, he would be doing morning radio like we're  doing here on 202.  So...  Well...  And a little wink here, but if they weren't happy with this show, they could have ended  this by October if they wanted to. 
[00:11:00]  So, you know, it's pretty obvious.  Advertisers want to advertise on the entire platform if they decide to advertise not on  premium.  Sorry, that's the reality.  Actually, the first year of the contract ends October 1st.  But, not to get into details, but basically they have to tell us, you know, three months  out if they're going to pick up the rest of our contract.  Right.  So what would that be?  That would be September, August, July 1st.  July 1st.  So, if we're still here July 1st, guess what?  XM really, really likes the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:11:30]  I think you'll be there.  I think you guys are doing a good job.  Dude, there's no doubt we'll be here.  Bubba Bo is just looking for attention and he just got some.  So, congratulations to Bubba Bo.  Yes, enjoy your midnight show and continue to languish in the spotlight at Friday at 12  o'clock and Saturday at 12 o'clock.  You're obviously a success.  And he only does weekends.  He does two shows a week.  Of course he does.  No one gives a shit about it.  A lot of confidence from XM in the Bubba Bo show.  Uh, Josh, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  How are you doing this morning?  Pretty good. 
[00:12:00]  Hi, Josh.  Alright, here's a synopsis of this fucking dude.  He's the fucking weekend guy on an AM midnight channel out of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Ugh!  Wow.  It originated by Dale Summers' The Truck and Bozo Show.  And he's a real stand-up guy all about information for truckers and stuff.  He's not a stand-up guy, sir.  He's a douchebag.  I've heard a lot about The Truck and Bozo Show.  Are you talking about the guy that trashed us?  No, no, no, no.  That's Bubba Bo.  Dale Summers, he's not actually on the channel anymore.  Oh, okay. 
[00:12:30]  He recently actually retired or was forced out of retirement.  I'm not really sure about the details, but his son took over.  And actually, Dale Summers has a show, Stiklonex, but that's another deal.  But his son took over.  And then, obviously, on the weekend, he got this Bubba Bozo, this fucking redneck-ish regurgitated  vaginal blood part.  It's the biggest tool I've seen.  I'm not even going to go into the description, but I haven't even listened to the show since  the original Dale Summers left it.  And I've just listened to you guys ever since.  I mean, it's a hell of a lot more entertaining. 
[00:13:00]  I keep giggling over my titted baby over there.  I got to tell you, I feel sorry for all these people that are jealous of the O.P. Anthony  program.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that we're getting all the attention.  What can I tell you?  Oh, please.  You know?  This pops up pretty much once a month.  Another show that's on the XM platform that's jealous of us.  I'm sorry that we're getting all the attention.  What can I tell you?  Yeah.  That's probably going to bother them that they spent more money on the studio on the time  you're off than he will ever make in his career.  That's really got to be upsetting. 
[00:13:30]  I'd bash us if I was another show.  Of course.  We're talking about them.  Yeah, right on.  We'll probably get some phone callers now next weekend.  Some of our fans call up, tell them they love the show, and then say, not you.  All that fun.  But it's never the type of calls.  They all think they can handle the calls, and they all think they can handle their message  boards being attacked, and they just have no idea.  No.  They have no idea.  If we're failures, why is Elo coming up to New York to hang with us?  You can't even address that like it's a possible statement.  He's just a jizz bag who wants to be spoken about. 
[00:14:00]  He's a fucking failure, and he's on at midnight.  Well, you know, a lot of these guys, they're very jealous of the O.P. Anthony program, but  they had the same opportunity as Ant and I.  They could have put their balls on the line to do a real radio show, but chose to follow  some stupid formula that a dumb program director handed to them and thought they were going  to get big doing it that way.  And that's just not how you get big in radio.  You've got to take chances.  You've got to get fired.  You've got to put your ass on the line on a daily basis because, quite frankly, the  people that run this radio crap are a bunch of dummies. 
[00:14:30]  They don't know what they're doing.  If they knew what they were doing, they would be doing their own radio shows.  And as soon as you realize that your boss is a dummy, you're not going anywhere in this business.  Most program directors have tried doing their own show.  Right.  And they fail miserably.  So then they figure they can now tell people how they should be doing their show for some  reason.  Program directors in radio are like gym teachers.  That's all they are.  Gym teachers are just a bunch of failures.  They're guys that try to make it in their sport, try to be a pro in, let's say, basketball, 
[00:15:00]  baseball, football, what have you.  And they either got injured or just weren't good enough to make it.  So what are you going to do now?  It's the worst environment to put in with kids also.  I had a gym teacher at John Glenn High School out there up beyond Long Island.  And he was Gil Lilienthal.  And this was a big, just a big bruiser guy.  And apparently he had a contract with the Bears.  And right before he was supposed to start, he had a leg injury, career ending leg injury. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And now here's this miserable son of a bitch teaching boys gym class.  And you know he wasn't sympathetic to anything.  He's angry every day he goes in because his football career was non-existent.  He was right there.  His whole life was set up to that point.  He gets the leg injury.  And now he's got to teach these kids that don't want to be there.  And he was really a prick.  He used to go around smacking people and stuff.  Yeah, he's miserable now. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  That's the gym teacher.  And it's the same philosophy in radio.  It really is.  I think Elo was in on Wednesday or Thursday last week.  He admitted he tried to do a radio show and he sucked at it.  Morning somewhere.  And Anthony and I, we've had program directors for the last 10 years.  We never took any of them seriously.  You know, if we listened to the program directors we had over the years,  we would just be just another show, do an afternoon drive, hopefully in New York.  That's about it.  That's about it.  Des Moines.  But we had the balls to, you know, to take some chances. 
[00:16:30]  We had a vision and we decided to go for it and no one was going to get in our way.  That's right.  You know, but guys like Bubba Bo, they've been just listening to their stupid program directors forever.  Look where it got them.  Doing like a weekend shift on XM.  Woo.  At where?  Cincinnati, Ohio or something?  Cincinnati.  Dude, you're not even in the big leagues.  You're like, you're like, you're not even triple A.  Mm-hmm.  You're minor league baseball.  You're like, you're not even the A leagues. 
[00:17:00]  You're in the, I was going to say the Grapefruit League, but that would be stupid.  Just another mediocre to no talent faggot who wants to piggyback and get noticed.  Sorry that XM isn't paying attention to you, man.  I think it's a really funny show.  He probably does a lot of good talking.  He probably has the sound effect he plays a lot when he wants to say something.  By the way, we have a lot of truckers that love this program.  We love the truckers.  We're not going to get them.  We're not going to get them all.  We understand that because, you know, our humor is sort of based on like a whole Northeast philosophy, 
[00:17:30]  but there's a bunch of truckers with open minds out there that enjoy this program as well.  It doesn't matter where they're from.  Buh, buh, buh, it's you.  Buh, buh.  That's right.  Tune in every weekend at, what, 3 in the morning to 315?  Buh, buh.  Hey, Shaky, what's up, Shaky?  All right.  I just got to say, I don't agree with hardly anything you guys said, but I love your show.  You make me laugh.  Right.  And I tried telling dumbfuck Redneck for that, and they hung up on me. 
[00:18:00]  Of course.  I mean, not even on the air.  Of course, because no one...  I never swore once I was polite just trying to tell him, hey, man, just because you don't  agree with their beliefs or their views don't mean you need to fucking not listen or whatever.  It's entertainment.  You know, here's a couple things.  You know, the one thing about this radio show that's unique, we don't really give a fuck  if you agree with what we say on this program.  This is a very real radio show where we just lay it on the line, and if you want to get 
[00:18:30]  pissed or you want to agree or if you want to just laugh or if you want to just change  the channel, then so be it.  Every other radio program out there has some kind of agenda, and they're praying and begging  and hoping that the listeners agree with every single thing they say.  That's the difference with our show.  We don't care.  We know there's enough people out there that are going to enjoy what we do, and that's  that.  No one does real radio anymore.  No one!  Yeah, preach.  They're all a bunch of pussies.  Howard Stern is the biggest pussy out there. 
[00:19:00]  We've been playing this XM satellite radio commercial that he did.  He doesn't even have the balls to address this.  We are just beating him up, making fun of him, stepping all over him.  He has nothing to say, because he can't fight this game anymore.  He had, for some reason, he had plenty to say when we were off the air.  When we were off the air, there was plenty to say.  But the second we're back, and now we can rebut what he's saying, then he shuts up.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, that's the beauty of this show.  We're doing real radio. 
[00:19:30]  You know, if a Bubba Bo is going to abuse us, we'll talk about it on our show, no problem.  I don't care.  And the funny thing is, guys like Bubba Bo and the rest of them, cool guy did it for  a little while.  That dude in Orlando that we made famous for a day and a half forgot his name already.  The chicks from the Playboy Channel forgot their names already.  They're all just making us bigger by talking about us.  You know, these dummies don't understand how radio works.  You get a Bubba Bo talking about us, okay?  That's just going to make more people that have XM check us out and become fans. 
[00:20:00]  And the reason?  Because we have talent.  Now the other thing is going to happen.  A bunch of people are going to check out Bubba Bo because we're talking about him,  and they're going to realize he's a complete failure in the business.  Thanks.  Well, now I have not heard him yet.  You're right.  He may be very talented.  I want to listen in and, you know.  He might be funny.  The favorite radio host of vampires all over the country.  You late night jerk off out of Cincinnati.  Yeah.  Ugh.  All right.  So where were we?  What do you do? 
[00:20:30]  Make little Reds game jokes?  Oh, well.  How about that Marge shot?  Speaking of which, the whole dragon wagon call is taking on a life of its own.  And the more I listen to that guy, I think he's a complete phony, by the way.  Of course he is!  I think he's a real phony that's just looking for attention.  Although, I guarantee he calls again today.  Right.  I guarantee he calls today because he's a huge fan.  Right.  Well, there's something going on there.  He wants attention, and I don't know.  We'll get to the bottom of that.  But someone made a flash animation of Norton going after him.  Yeah.  It's up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com. 
[00:21:00]  You've got to check it out.  It's very, very funny.  Very funny.  That's the beauty of this show.  The new version of this show, because I guess the technology's gotten better since we got fired,  the listeners are taking our bits, making flash animation, making remixes.  They're just going nuts with the production for this show now.  It's gotten easier, so more people can do it.  Yeah.  They're photoshopping like crazy.  We talk about a subject.  Next thing you know, they're photoshopping our faces into situations.  Yeah.  They're linked on wackbag.com, all these websites that we really love and enjoy that are fan 
[00:21:30]  sites are all linked on opianthony.com for the new listener.  You know, in your free time, you should check some of them out.  Hey, Eric, what's Bubba Bow's website?  Let's give that out.  We don't dump out of other show names on this show.  You want to listen to the show?  Go ahead.  Tune it in.  Bubba Bow.  What was the station?  If anybody knows it, say it again.  Friday at midnight, Saturday at midnight.  There you go.  You've got to plug, scumbag.  He probably doesn't even have a website.  Let me make a blanket statement for this whole program.  We fear no one. 
[00:22:00]  We fear no one on this program.  No one.  All right?  We know.  We know we're the best at fighting this game and playing the game this way.  No one will take us out.  No one.  Yeah.  Especially a guy named Bubba Bow.  Bubba Bow.  All right, where were we before the Bubba Bow thing?  Talking about the weekend.  You with your Vicodin.  With the Vicodin and stuff.  But Friday, a little tangent on what happened. 
[00:22:30]  Friday, I had to go to the dentist at 1215.  Right around, like two doors down from the studio here.  Very convenient.  So I'm playing a little poker from the time I get off the radio.  You're just killing time before your appointment, right?  Killing time.  Before the appointment.  So I'm in one of the sit and go games, which you sit down with nine other people.  And it's elimination.  You've got to wait until the end.  If you eliminate everybody, you win $50. 
[00:23:00]  $10 buy-in.  You win $50.  If you come in second, you win $30.  You come in third, you win $10.  Yeah, $20.  Something like that.  Well, $50 is the win.  So I'm doing really well.  Nothing but high stakes for you, huh?  High stakes.  Oof.  Oof.  And then people get mad when I say, you know, the $10 room isn't an expensive room.  Yeah.  You know, $10 is a lot to me.  I didn't mean it that way, idiot.  I meant that it's the cheap room that you can get into.  It's $10.  Is that the cheapest room you can get into?  I think there's a five.  Okay. 
[00:23:30]  So I'm playing, and I'm noticing now 12-15 is creeping up.  And it's not over yet.  You can't just bail out.  It's not one of those things.  It's a tournament of elimination.  So I can't just leave the tournament or I'm out.  So I figured I'm going to, like, try to lose.  I'm going to really play reckless and try to lose or win this real quick.  So I'm going all in on just awful hands, and people are folding.  So then I'm raising before the flop comes out, the first three cards. 
[00:24:00]  So I raise, and people see my raise, and then the flop comes out.  No matter what I have, boom, all in, and everyone folds.  And I pick up their raise and the blinds, the blind bets.  So now I'm chip leader by blowing away everybody.  I got, like, there's a total of 8,000 chips available between the 10 people.  You start with 800 each.  So I think I was up to, I had maybe 3,500 of the chips.  And the other people had it kind of dispersed.  I had eliminated maybe five or six people, something like that. 
[00:24:30]  And I had to go.  So I left the game in the capable hands of Nathaniel with a huge chip lead.  Nathaniel's our intern here, one of our great interns.  And I found out he had just signed up.  You had just gotten an account for the poker?  That's correct.  Yes.  So I figured he's the go-to guy to hand the game over to because I had to go to the dentist.  So I hand it over to Nathaniel, and I leave.  So when I get home that night, I eagerly go to check my account to see what happened. 
[00:25:00]  Lo and behold, there was 50 additional dollars in there.  He had eliminated the competition and cleaned their clocks and won me some cash.  Very nice, Nathaniel.  Great job.  Was it hard?  Was it easier with the chip lead that was handed to you?  It was really easy.  Basically, I was sort of continuing your strategy of betting an obscene amount, making pretty much everybody fold.  Yeah.  And then, you know, if they had to go all in and they happened to beat me, you know, I lost 100 chips. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, you lost it because they didn't really have it.  Once you're in that situation where you've got a lot of chips and the rest of them don't really have that much, you just muscle them around and eliminate them.  And very good job, Nathaniel.  Thank you.  Anything I can do to increase your payroll.  I know.  Here's the intern.  Works for nothing.  He's making me $50.  You're such a slave driver, man.  I know.  Isn't that a slave driver, man?  I thought that, too.  That's pretty scummy.  Yeah, these guys, they're technically interns, but they're here every day. 
[00:26:00]  They get here around 5 and they don't leave until like noon, well, even later.  And they're just working for free.  But I actually, I have to break 100, but what I was going to do is give Nathaniel that 50 to put in your poker account.  Don't spend it on anything.  Put it in the poker account and start rolling.  I'll gamble it responsibly.  I'm giving you that 50.  Why don't you just give him 100?  What?  It's 100.  Why should I give him 100?  Part of it's labor.  Part of it's what he won, but also the time he had to spend winning it.  Give him an extra 50 for bringing the Trainables audio to the program. 
[00:26:30]  That's right, man.  Look who's telling me to give him money.  That is a good point.  Look at the black guy going, hey, get a job.  I got my bankroll from Atlantic City right here.  Whoa.  Hey, hey, hey.  What is that?  Opie, wait, Opie has cash in his pocket?  I got a lot of cash.  Stop it.  Where did that come from?  Thanks to Joey Paisano.  Oh.  Did you kill somebody?  Look at all.  Did you whack someone?  It's all in 20s.  Yeah, I know.  Joey actually sends his tax returns in cash. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, cash.  You know, I got some good Atlantic City stories, but I also want to talk about what happened last night.  That's why I'm a little hyper right now.  Jimmy.  Was that the first fart in the morning?  Oh, God.  Right out of Jimmy's ass.  Was it a fart or a squeaky chair?  Chair.  Yeah.  No, honestly, I don't know.  Get some change for that.  Oh, look at that.  Because I absolutely want you to use that 50.  I want to see you parlay that.  Yeah, parlay that 50 into what?  Parlay. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, sir.  Parlay.  Into 60 bucks.  Look at Norton.  I got a lot of money on them, too.  How much you got?  Oh, gee, who knows?  Just a few hundred.  Nothing much.  Let's see what I got.  Let's see.  Holy crap.  There's only 20s.  Oh, those are all 20s, too?  Only 20s.  I got one.  I got four.  I got four.  Anthony's got...  You got 400?  All you got to do is get changed out of hand.  There you go.  But this is just...  Oh, you got...  I'll give you 20s.  All right.  Make a change for Nathaniel.  40, 60, 80, 100.  I don't have a 10. 
[00:28:00]  Give him 60, then.  You know what?  Here you go.  20, 40, 60.  You got balls, kids.  Good job.  Good job.  Two, three, four, five.  You kicked ass.  Thank you, sirs.  I got 600.  Don't you spend that on food or medicine or no shit like that.  Yeah.  I want that spent on gambling.  Dude, I got the...  Gotta teach these kids.  I got 600, which means I only lost 400 in Atlantic City.  That's not too bad, actually.  All right.  My mic is too quiet.  Yeah, well, I've been...  It sounds like I'm yelling from the other room.  I know. 
[00:28:30]  I've been turning you up.  I don't know what else to do.  Maybe it's better now.  You got to eat...  Just eat that mic.  Well, the problem is with your root canal thing, you know, you're...  Yeah, I kind of...  You're not boosting your voice like you usually do.  Speech softly.  Like you usually do.  You're sick.  Anyway...  Anyway, last night I go to bed real early because, you know, we had the Atlantic City  weekend and stuff and I'm in bed around 9.  I mean, I've been staying up a lot later with these new hours.  Have you?  Yeah, it's been nice. 
[00:29:00]  It's been working out well.  I don't stutter and fumble around with my words as much.  I'm getting a good night's sleep.  But, uh...  So, I'm sleeping for a good 2 to 3 hours.  Alright?  And all of a sudden my buzzer.  Eh...  Eh...  Eh...  Over and over again.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm in such a deep sleep, I'm thinking my alarm clock's going off.  I can't figure out what the noise is and I finally wake up.  Sounds fine on the air to me.  Thanks, man.  Sounds fine.  Okay.  You could just grab a mic and say that.  I don't miss that apartment living.  Huh? 
[00:29:30]  I don't miss that apartment living.  I remember that.  Meh.  Meh.  Ugh.  So, maybe, uh...  I might have to talk to the NYPD after the show today is all I'm thinking.  Really?  Yeah, the more I think about it.  Scam.  So, uh...  Yeah, Ben is with me.  He thinks scam.  So, uh, the buzzer's going off like crazy and I finally, like, realize it's my, you know,  my buzzer and I stagger upstairs.  My two-level abode.  Thank you.  Oh, oh, oh.  He's been relaxed. 
[00:30:00]  So, um...  So, then I hit the, uh, you know, the talk thing.  I'm like, yeah, what do you want?  Those things work so well.  Yeah, what do you want?  I'm going to talk about that, Ken.  What?  He either said FedEx or I'm going to murder you.  What?  What?  I'm taking a package and I'm going to kill you.  Wait.  You have a package for me or you're going to kill me?  I'm going to kill my...  I'm going to kill my...  I'm going to kill my...  I'm going to kill my...  I'm going to kill my... 
[00:30:30]  ...murder fucking knife.  What?  So...  I understand a word they say through those.  Well, here's the problem.  I'm hitting talk like, yeah, what do you want?  Something like that.  And all I hear is...  You're going to miss me, sir.  He's not hitting the talk button back...  Oh.  ...on the intercom.  Just yelling.  hear him outside okay and he's trying to tell me there's some kind of delivery  whatever delivery like food delivery that's all I can understand you hear the  voice yeah very well could you imitate maybe what he sounded like did you 
[00:31:00]  order a motherfucking pizza was it like that well I don't put maybe could you  put a little inflection on it to imitate maybe what the voice sounded like  everyone knows I don't do a lot of voices on this program so I will write I will  write what kind of a gentleman this was and then maybe you can help me oh Bob  just based on on and oh okay all right something on the paper that now completely 
[00:31:30]  explains so he was there but he's not pushing the talk button and now I'm  thinking now now I'm thinking now that I'm wide awake that this is part of the  scam probably uh-huh so uh so I I keep pushing the button what do you want because  I was woken up from a deep deep sleep right sleep right and and I could hear  outside the window that he's telling me in this in this voice that there's boys  some kind of delivery right some kind I think pizza delivery okay  did it sound something like that uh yeah similar sure yeah I got some delivery 
[00:32:00]  is it something something to that effect yeah something similar right so so  again hitting trying to get this guy to talk to the intercom what what do you want I  didn't order anything and he's he's insisting that I order this uh this pizza  uh-oh so now I'm like god I can't hear the guy through the intercom so now I leave 
[00:32:30]  my apartment now I leave my apartment see here's where you get really stupid  now I leave my apartment here's where no matter where you live now it is  completely understandable that you grew up on Long Island right so because you  shouldn't have gone out now here's the confusion um it turned out it was only  eleven thirty at night but because I was in bed and out cold I really didn't know  what time it was and in my stupid brain I thought it was the middle of the night do  you think a cowboy at a fort years ago hearing would open the main gate and go 
[00:33:00]  outside do you really think so no you stay in you send some guys up to the  towers with guns and you protect yourself yeah within your fortress so I leave my  apartment and go to the front door which is double doors and it's it's  relatively safe you know considering okay uh and he's inside the first door  and he's just looking at the second through the second window yeah right at  me and this guy was one of the scariest mofos I've ever seen in my life but he 
[00:33:30]  had your pizza carrying a Domino's Pizza box above the warm bags I don't know what  the fuck was in that oh geez this guy had gold toothuses yeah he had Domino's  pizza with Glock topping he had gold teeth he looked like he stepped right out of  one of these rap videos okay no no no that's not even true cuz now all the rap  videos they're all polished and nice yeah and this guy old school this was old 
[00:34:00]  school scary looking dude with a Domino's you know bag with pizza trying to  convince me that I ordered the pizza maybe you didn't you forgot and I'm like  look and now we're yelling through the glass I'm like I didn't order the you know  the pizza he's like no you ordered the pizza and then he's given my address he  goes yeah see you order the pizza it's right on the box your address you ordered  this man just just open the door man we'll talk about this we can talk about this if  you open the door I don't think so and then he's getting scared of you sir yeah 
[00:34:30]  exactly I'm scared I'm scared of you this is this is me talking through the glass  yeah I'm scared of you sir and I'm protecting myself I am protecting myself I am  scared of you please follow the police so he's he's really trying to convince me to  open up the the final door Anthony you don't want to hire niggas that's all the  final door now let me just explain to get to me you have to go through four locked  doors four locked doors it's down to three are all open and ready to go oh boy 
[00:35:00]  there's only one to go one safety door left this is now it all makes sense to me  you know this morning with a clear head so he's like he's trying to get me to  open that final door to try to figure out this pizza situation show me the  address right on the box I have to order there's my address what's in the box  this is what I wanted to tell him you're a phony hey this guy's a great big phony 
[00:35:30]  hey you're a great big phony you know that that's right you're a big fat phony  taunt him through the glass  now what if some resident of the building would have come up at that  point and and open the door to get in that would have been a sticky situation  well then well then there's you know two of us so I don't know  remember when uh... Noonan was in the cage and Denunzio walked up  and he wouldn't give him the coke then you get a no coke huh  and he's making fun of them calls him a jerk 
[00:36:00]  and the head of the caddy shack came in opened it up told me to get out  and then there was that thing would have happened to you  fight with the bloody knife  no bare feet  so this guy is just kind of throwing his arms up and down and he's getting really  pissed off and like you know just screaming to the glass it didn't order the  fucking pizza man you know and then he finally he gave it a he gave it a really  good try and then he finally left hmm and then i went back to you know my  apartment just kind of freaked out about the whole situation and then all night 
[00:36:30]  long just kind of listening with half an ear like wondering if he's coming back  and all that  and then when i was again and then when i left this morning i was too i was kind  of scared to leave the place  yeah i definitely was because i don't know what the hell that was all about  well not in the morning yeah i was hanging out there dude i don't leave one of  those i don't want to somebody else  let me explain something jimmy when i leave my apartment it's still dark  when you get here the sun is uh... shining nice and high  there's a big difference when we leave our apartment i know that but do you 
[00:37:00]  understand six hours later you're still there with pizza  who knows  don't do you understand things are scarier at night  yes  you know  you get here it's bright sunshine you have to put sunscreen on when aunt and i get  to work and get sunscreen  when we get to work and start you know preparing for the show it's still pitch dark  you just start hearing the birds a little bit just a little bit because  they're waking up with you  so what do you think uh... this could have been uh... a home invasion do you think  it's that been a legitimate mistake 
[00:37:30]  or setup  well  no joke the guy was scary it sounds the delivery guys are scary yeah but it  sounds like it could have been uh...  a mistake  but you don't know better to err on the side of safety and not what we do you  didn't want a pizza so you don't let him in anyway  fact that he's ringing your buzzer i used to love the guy that would come to  deliver and just  smash a hand two hands over all the buzzers just so they can get in the door  and some idiot just man buzzes him in  the whole security system falls apart 
[00:38:00]  because there's one idiot one idiot in your building just meh i don't care  right i'll hit the rape rob kill button over here and let him in  it's there for a reason you jackass  but if you let him in  then he comes to your door and knocks you open that door  kick it in  that's all the invasion that's what i'm thinking and hopefully he's just there  for your property  that's what i'm thinking  maybe he's a big guy they just intimidate you into paying him for the pizza  you didn't order  he's upper west side you know white people be scared of him 
[00:38:30]  and he correct me look man  i got this pizza that walks around with like one pizza  well you know i've told the story a bunch of times on the radio but i  i i'm  pretty  you know safe  because what happened in buffalo  what the famous story in buffalo  well which one was that you remember the famous story in buffalo  is when i was working all i do now  all that's creepy dudes what i'm about that you were a victim of the new  listeners for for 
[00:39:00]  what i'm about to tell you is no radio exaggeration this is exactly how it  happened  what you're about to hear is shocking  this is exact  okay i was i was doing overnights in uh buffalo  and so i was sleeping a lot of days and stuff blah blah blah  i was in this brownstone that had you know in a crappy neighborhood north pearl  street which was like  there was a lot of happy neighborhood buffalo  yeah well it was like a lot of heroin addicts a lot of druggies  you know i wasn't making much money in the buffalo 
[00:39:30]  and my apartment was very close to the station so it was convenient but it was a  safe building you had to get through two doors and then your apartment door to get to you know to get to the person okay right and uh opie is a pussy should have called dominoes i'd eric from miami yet i was too tired went back to bed yeah keep the door lock go to sleep and uh you know and then just wonder all night that's all yeah anyway so i'm in buffalo and um it was a brownstone and yeah the front 
[00:40:00]  stupid reason i have no idea to this day why i have no idea it was just dumb  you know i was like on the fourth floor in the back and figured  i don't know i just did it  insanity  so uh...  asking for it  around this time in buffalo there was a uh... a rapist that they were very very concerned about  a black rapist swear to god  very very concerned about they did some stories on the news you know he raped here he raped there he raped here blah blah blah 
[00:40:30]  right  oh no  so uh...  so i'm sleeping on a i think it was a saturday or sunday in the middle of the day right  and uh...  some idiots in the building like anthony was just talking about  they were moving out  so they didn't want to be inconvenienced so they propped open both the bottom doors  eh why not  so they're getting a load from upstairs and they have the bottom doors propped so they could get it into their station wagons and stuff  it was one of those cheap moves where you get all your friends and you try to get it all in a couple of cars you know 
[00:41:00]  the only problem is we lived in a really bad neighborhood  so this was uh... you know gave somebody the opportunity to sneak in while you're going back upstairs uh... to get more stuff  right  so this is all i remember  i'm out cold  laying on my side  and i wake up because i guess i feel a presence in my room  oh boy  this is the god's honest truth man  i open my eyes to see 
[00:41:30]  a black guy in a hooded sweatshirt with the hood you know pulled down really tight  around his head  staring at me two to three inches away from my face  did you go  oh my heart was in my throat  of course  and i open up my eyes  until his cock pushed it out  i open up my eyes and uh... 
[00:42:00]  and the only thing i can say is  uh...  uh... what are you doing here  oh that's a good one  well what else are you gonna do  how many times has he heard that before  i was like  i'm like what are you doing here and i had long hair back then you know i was doing the rock thing  oh my god  what you were almost raped  yeah that's what he's getting at jimmy  oh my god  well what way to wake up you're right  yeah  oh yeah  guys right there in the room 
[00:42:30]  well this is this is what  yeah i i could figure out uh... what happened here  so he's you know very close to my face i open my eyes and go what are you doing here  i didn't know what to do you're not gonna  i didn't i wasn't gonna make the first move i didn't know what you know i was waiting to see what the hell this is all about  and uh... obviously couldn't be good  why else would you know i couldn't be good  why else would he be in my room you know i didn't even have a pizza box  so i open my eyes and go what are you doing here he looks at me i look at him and then he jumps up and bolts 
[00:43:00]  and runs out of my apartment  i'm like oh my god oh my god i jump out of bed like holy crap what the f  and remember um... i had some kind of like uh... metal shelves whatever right inside my apartment where i always just threw my keys in my wallet  when i came in and just like don't that you know what right  and i'm i'm away from home and all that crap  so i'm thinking right away now i'm thinking oh my god oh my god  you know nothing's gonna happen to me  but what the fuck did he you know take from my apartment  uh... so i jump out of bed because i hear the front door kind of you know slam uh... closed again or whatever 
[00:43:30]  and i run and my wallet and my keys are missing  so but  fast forward a little bit turns out i found them  it was in my jeans or something i i just didn't put them you know there  okay  um...  he runs out he didn't take anything from my apartment is the key to the story  so now you know thinking about everything that went on that day  i'm thinking he was looking to rape again  yes  and he saw this opportunity you know this brownstone is wide open because these people are leaving  long blonde haired girl laying in bed 
[00:44:00]  exactly so he he goes into this apartment starts all you know trying for doors that are unlocked  bingo mines unlocked he goes in you know carefully  you know it sneaks into the bedroom sees me maybe with my longer long hair on the pillow i don't know  it's flowing and now he's looking now he's looking you know real close to see if i'm a chick or not  that's the only thing i could think of  man  good thing you said something he might have plastered your face in the pillow and still not knowing you're a guy just 
[00:44:30]  thrusted up your ass  oh  can you imagine do you know how close you came  yeah that was that what if the guy didn't care guy or girl  true  wow  that was the scariest moment of my life right there  oh  the scariest moment of my life  jesus  so and then i i was able to like run out of the building to see him sprinting down the road  yeah  and that was the last i ever saw the dude obviously so  oh  the last you ever saw of him do you miss it  he never even came back 
[00:45:00]  thing hard to get  that was going through my mind last night with this weird dominoes experience  man  yeah  i wouldn't even uh no i wouldn't even have left the apartment  like what who no no pizza go away  well he gave  he kept ringing the buzzer over and over again  he was getting you know  obnoxious  stop ringing the buzzer  call the cops  there's a man  there's a negro at my door  i don't know what to do when a negro comes to my door 
[00:45:30]  joe from jersey what's up  hey good morning guys  oh come on man  splurge the extra money  and go for the high class apartment with the concierge there to keep those guys out  uh... yeah well norton's like it's time to get in a building with a doorman  all right take it easy punch it out  all right  thank you and let's go to angelo in brooklyn angelo  hey listen  uh... love the show guys  got news for you  it's gotta be a scam  dominoes takes your number when you place the order  and i've had it happen if they can't get you to the door they'll call your phone

[00:55:00]  Let's all step into the O.P. and Anthony time machine so we can go see Patrice O'Neill at, uh, at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
[00:55:30]  Gotta love the promos that play, uh, for dates that are, that are gone.  Yeah, we'll acknowledge someone effed up on that one.  Uh, got a couple of emails, instant feedbacks actually, about the post headlines.  A couple of people had their favorite, when, uh, Yasa Arafat died, it said, the Arafat Lady Sings.  Quite a sense of humor, and my all-time favorite was, uh, Fred Astaire dying, and it said, a stairway to heaven. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, nice.  Yeah, that's not, well, we're looking for funny.  Yeah, that's pretty funny because you get, it's really just, no class is what it is.  It's, it's so New York Post, a stairway to heaven, they use his name, a stairway to heaven.  Give the guy a little more respect than that.  Yeah.  Your mic is all weird today, bro.  Is it?  Yeah, I got, I, I'm out of it now, too.  It's word?  It's word.  That's word.  Wait, now try it. 
[00:56:30]  Hello?  Ooh, if I turn off.  I'm at a party.  What?  If I turn off Ben's mic.  Here, just move that mic away.  Move it away.  Oh, look at us.  There you go.  I'm out of the new studio.  What, that sounds better?  Yeah, now it sounds perfect.  Hey, how about that?  How do I sound?  Now it sounds perfect.  It sounds good.  No, I know on the air it sounds good.  Fine, on the air.  I know, I know it doesn't sound right to you guys, but on the air it sounds really good.  Let me try this now.  Yeah, yeah.  But it has to sound good for us in our headphones so we're not distracted, bitching, and complaining  so we could actually do radio for once.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  I just want to hear what this, this one sounds much better in my headphones than this one does. 
[00:57:00]  Same, your own mic.  All right.  This one sounds great.  Ben sounds great.  All right, move over there and just use that mic.  And this sounds like I'm underwater.  You dropped something.  All right, no, no, no, no.  No, don't take yourself out of the game again.  Grab that mic.  I'm not.  Grab that mic.  I don't want to sit over there.  I want to sit here.  Yeah, that's his spot.  All right, then just stay there.  Eric, he's not using that mic.  Just throw it over there.  No.  No, that mic's off.  Ah!  It sounds better on that one.  It shouldn't, but it does.  You sound fine. 
[00:57:30]  But to me, I sound underwater.  Well, I purposely did that because it's not about you.  I know, but still, I just don't want to sound like I'm drowning.  I went in to take a leak during the break, and I go into one of the stall areas, and Jimmy  is in the stall area next to me.  He walks in there, and I hear him go, psst.  You know, he does his little things.  Yeah.  So I'm taking a leak, and of course, I'm looking down at the toilet bowl in front of  me as I take a leak.  And Jimmy starts talking, and all of a sudden, this yellow stream starts hitting the floor 
[00:58:00]  right by the toilet.  He didn't do that again.  He's leaking.  He's pissing from underneath.  He's pissing into my stall.  And just starts laughing like an idiot.  As I see this yellow stream going down.  You do realize someone has to clean up this crap.  You're like a dog.  Someone has to clean this up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's their job.  Jimmy makes the jokes.  Other people have to clean up.  Are you trying to say they should have done better in high school?  No, why not?  Maybe they can come in here and fix this. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Peter in New Jersey.  Peter, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Best headline of all time was probably close to 10 years ago at this point.  Okay.  But it was that whole Tonya Harding scandal when they pretty much pinpointed her, and it  said, bodyguard fingers Tonya.  That's a good one.  That is a good one.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Another post headline.  When Bush's daughters got busted for underage drinking, Jenna and Tonic.  Ooh, that's a little rough. 
[00:59:00]  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  That's a little rough.  Pat from Monarchie writing the headline.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  All right.  Here's the deal.  So the New York Post Saturday, the headline, Brooklyn bigot arrested for mocking midget family.  Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to court, he goes.  The picture is of a mother and a daughter.  Uh-huh.  Let's start with that.  No, it isn't, first of all.  Huh?  It's not of a mother and daughter.  No?  It's a freak show that is calling themselves a mother and a daughter.  Well, the mother looks relatively normal, except for the fact that she is a midget, if that 
[00:59:30]  makes sense.  Yeah.  Because she's sitting down and stuff.  You can't really tell how short she really is at all, and she's wearing a big puffy coat.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  She doesn't really look like a midget, how she's sitting there.  But her daughter's standing up with her little midget arms around her neck.  Oh, she's got, like, they're taking a portrait type of picture with the mother sitting, the  daughter's standing behind her.  Right.  And has those little cocktail frank fingers on her mother's shoulder. 
[01:00:00]  And she's got a wild afro, a white headband on, and...  Wearing a jersey.  I think she's half black, Anthony.  She's half black.  She's got some kind of NBA jersey on.  It might be Seattle.  Seattle jersey, kind of dressing, I don't know, a little bit like the homeboys would  dress in the hood, right?  And they're very depressed, obviously, because they've been getting harassed by this bigot 
[01:00:30]  in Brooklyn.  They got the guy's name?  Yeah, I got to get to that.  So, here we go.  Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off the court, he goes.  A family of midgets in Brooklyn were mercilessly mocked by their neighbor who painted a yellow  brick road in front of their house and sang, hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to work we go.  As they walked by, cops said yesterday, he actually took the time and trouble to get paint and 
[01:01:00]  paint a yellow brick road.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  From their front door, I guess.  Motivated.  From their front door down the sidewalk or whatever.  They went past five houses.  This guy didn't just do the joke to the curb.  Five houses.  Five houses.  Where is this guy?  We got to hire him for the radio.  Do you know how many times you have to go and shake it and back up and make sure you're  not tripping? 
[01:01:30]  I'll show those.  Show those.  This guy, this guy was motivated.  Highly motivated.  Joseph Izzo, I-Z-Z-O, I-Z-Z-O, I-Z-Z-O.  I figure.  Joseph Izzo.  I figure's an Italian guy, right?  Was arrested after.  Joey Izzo.  He was arrested after a three-week campaign of abuse against his neighbors, three-foot-eight,  Debra Shea and her three-foot-six daughter, Concilian? 
[01:02:00]  What?  Pegas?  What?  Her name is Concilian, C-O-N-S-C-E-L-E-A-N.  Close enough?  Wow, I've never heard of that name.  Yeah.  He was charged with menacing, stalking, and aggravated harassment.  Five houses.  He painted this yellow brick road.  Someone take the yellow brick road to work.  I can take the yellow brick road.  I hold, it's home from work we go. 
[01:02:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I hold, it's home from work we go.  Don't laugh at me.  I hold, I hold.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, okay, terrific.  All right.  I actually think that if you're abusing and hassling midgets, it should only be a misdemeanor.  I hold, I hold, I hold, I hold, I hold, I hold, I hold, I hold, I hold, I hold, I hold. 
[01:03:00]  The visual is just hilarious.  They're walking out of their house just trying to make a damn living like everyone else.  But they have to deal with their shortness.  They got this idiot fucking singing this.  Out his screen.  Out his kitchen window screen.  Hey, you fucking midget, huh?  Hey, midget.  Joe Izzo.  Joe Izzo.  Let's continue with the story, Anthony.  The yellow brick road ended in court after a Brooklyn man allegedly harassed a midget mother 
[01:03:30]  and her equally diminutive daughter, mocking them relentlessly with chants like,  Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to work we go.  Joseph Izzo's campaign of hate culminated with his arrest Thursday after he spray-painted...  Oh, yeah.  That's classic, man.  How do you not see the humor in this?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  After he spray-painted a yellow line outside the Brighton Beach home before telling them 
[01:04:00]  to follow the yellow brick road according to court documents.  Oh, my God.  Izzo 40 had been taunting the pair for about three weeks, leading them to call the cops.  Shea said she and Izzo, who stands 5'8", have known each other for 30 years.  Get out of here.  They've been neighbors that long?  Yeah, the guy has known the midget family for 30 years, Anthony.  He probably never noticed them before.  He just looked down one day.  Oh, my God.  And would regularly hang out and have dinner together. 
[01:04:30]  Really?  But about three weeks ago, Izzo just bugged out, she said.  I bet she's on medication of some sort.  Some kind of a medication.  Yeah, of course.  Maybe his tooth hurt and he was on Vicodin.  They'd have dinner, they'd order mushrooms, he'd eat one, she'd sit under it.  So he just started bugging out three weeks ago after knowing the family for 30 years.  Shea, which is the mother, I guess, first called police to her house on April 5th, claiming  Izzo walked up to the 16-year-old daughter, whose father is black, and told her, 
[01:05:00]  You low-life nigger, you better watch your back.  Jeez.  He went on to call her a little bitch before threatening, I'm going to kill you, according  to court documents.  He sang, Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to work we go, like we're dwarfs, not human beings,  Shea told the Post yesterday.  Well, you know what it was, when they heard, Hi-ho, they thought the father was just home  from work again. 
[01:05:30]  Izzo was not arrested after that incident, but he was collared on Thursday.  I know, two days after he allegedly...  Good point.  Just walking in from a night of criminal mischief.  Delivering pizza.  Izzo was not arrested after that incident, but he was collared on Thursday, two days  after he allegedly used yellow spray paint to draw a line from the front of their house  out into the street, and he extended the yellow line five houses down the block. 
[01:06:00]  Boom-pa, boom-pa, doom-pa-dee-doo, I've got another puzzle for you.  Boom-pa, boom-pa, doom-pa-dee-dee, if you are wise, you listen to me.  Awful little hands.  When Izzo saw Shay...  Like chocolate.  He allegedly told her to follow the yellow brick road, the song sung by the Munchkins in  the classic The Wizard of Oz.  Did they actually explain that in the paper?  I know, isn't that great that they have to explain that? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Follow the yellow brick road.  The criminal complaint said Izzo went on to call her a welfare bitch before yelling,  look at the midgets.  They're bringing in the fucking niggers here.  Oh, Jesus.  Here comes the circus.  This guy just lost his mind.  The guy's blaming the midgets for bringing the blacks into the neighborhood?  Yeah.  I never really saw that whole accusation thing going, but...  Izzo was slapped with two counts of menacing, stalking, and aggravated harassment as a 
[01:07:00]  hate crime.  Ah, once you get that hate crime, it's over, Johnny.  No one gets acquitted of those.  I gotta say, when you start spray painting in front of people's houses, there's a problem.  Yeah.  You know, if you just want to, like, you know, make remarks, and maybe put, you know, lit  dog shit in their mailbox.  Hey, midget!  Scream that over the fence.  Yeah, midget!  A couple other things here.  The daughter, a junior at Lincoln High School, admitted the brutal barbs hurt, but said there 
[01:07:30]  was nothing she could do about it.  Yeah.  Realistic.  That's why she has the afro, isn't it?  She just wants to be taller somehow?  Yeah.  Yeah, when they measure her, she tells them not to crush the fro, add another couple inches  on that.  How tall are they, oh, three foot something?  Three foot eight and three foot six.  Those are real midgets.  So the afro makes her probably about four foot tall.  I mean, four foot two is tall, but three foot six.  Three six. 
[01:08:00]  It hurts, but I know I could deal with it, she said.  I just ignore it, but every day it just hurts.  That must have been a real drunken night of Colt 45 for that brother to hit that.  Well, he's a midget, too, I think.  Is it?  I don't know.  Is the black father a midget?  You don't have to be.  Dude, it's a black father.  We don't know where he is.  Yeah, but...  Jesus.  I don't know, something tells me he was a midget, I'm not sure why.  Yeah?  There's no sign of the father in this article, so I don't know what's going on with that.  Well, would you stick around if you were him, if you knocked up that awful woman? 
[01:08:30]  She looks like William Frawley in the face.  Cute.  Let's see, her mother feels betrayed by the attacks.  People are mean, but have never been harassed like this.  He was my friend.  Despite the hurt, she wants to move on.  And just let's get along and let's be happy, she said.  There was actually, um...  Oh, shit.  What?  I completely...  Wow.  Lost my thought. 
[01:09:00]  I had like a real...  I had a real thought there, ready to come out.  And right before it came out.  Oh.  Just lost it.  Oh my God, it went away.  I hate that.  Oh, it's the worst.  Well, Anthony, there's a follow-up to the story that was in the post yesterday.  Thank goodness.  Ooh.  Clown blasts a bozo.  Nice headline, okay.  Midgetkin rips bigot.  Coco, the killer clown, has spoken out on the biased incident reported in yesterday's post. 
[01:09:30]  Thank God.  Coco, the killer clown.  I've been waiting for Coco's statement.  Who is Coco, the killer clown?  Well, we're going to find out in a second here.  Okay.  You ready for this?  Uh-huh.  Here's the post trying to be funny and wacky again.  All right.  This article starts with Tears of a Clown.  Oh, I get it.  That's the song title.  Yeah, there it is.  Tears of a Clown were flowing yesterday as a famed Brooklyn circus performer reacted 
[01:10:00]  with disgust to charges that a once-friendly neighbor mocked his midget mom and sister  about their diminutive stature.  Yeah?  How about that?  Sorry.  Coco, the killer clown, who for five years was a midget fixture at Coney Island sideshows  by the seashore, came out swinging at Joseph Izzo, the Brooklyn bigot, now facing charges  of harassment, stalking, and menacing for terrorizing Coco's family. 
[01:10:30]  The killer clown versus the Brooklyn bigot.  That's a nice wrestling match.  I didn't know that Coco, the killer clown, was related to the two that were being harassed.  Who knew?  Who knew?  A fixture on Coney Island.  He's the famous one in the family, Anthony.  If any place, if any place on the surface of this globe needed a tsunami, it's Coney Island.  Please, God.  Oh, imagine seeing the top of that big Ferris wheel just poking out from under some water, 
[01:11:00]  knowing that that whole area has just been cleansed of the freaks, degenerates, and criminals  that are there.  I think the last time that place was fun and festive was in, like, black and white films  of the people in suits spinning on those things, of the horse jumping into the big bucket.  They used to walk a lot faster back then, too, I noticed.  For some reason, they all moved faster.  I don't get that, but...  They'd walk down the boardwalk fast, eat their ice cream cone in fast motion. 
[01:11:30]  It was really strange how they used to walk around back in the old days.  One-piece things for the men over the shoulders, the stripes.  Do you think they really saw color back then?  No, everything was actually in black and white.  We've had colored films for many, many years, but things were actually just in black and  white.  The way the sun reflects off the stuff, it was just black and white.  So, yeah, they showed the old footage of Coney Island and everything was in black and  white?  Oh, yeah, that's all authentic.  So when did people start seeing in color, you think?  It was sort of around World War II.  Really?  Something the Germans did to the sun that made it actually start reflecting colors here on 
[01:12:00]  Earth.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Who was the brainiac that finally decided that women don't need to wear dresses to go  swimming?  Yeah, well, that was the good old days.  Jesus.  They actually wear, like, skirts and hops.  I love old footage of people hanging out at the beach.  Coney Island.  Because you know the temperature didn't change much, and everyone's been at the beach when  it's like 100 degrees, and these stupid women had to go swimming in dresses. 
[01:12:30]  It's a wonderful day here at Coney Island, and the girls, boy, you can't see a gas anywhere.  Where are the thong bikinis?  You had to have a really nice imagination back then.  Yeah, really.  And they'd, like, just go in up to the bottom of their skirt, and they'd be holding, like,  a parasol.  Yeah.  And have a big hat with flowers and birds on it.  Can you imagine living back then, and you see a face at the beach, and she's wearing  one of these long, flowing dresses to go swimming. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  And you really have no idea what her body was going to look like when you got it home.  I rubbed some sunblock on your nose.  Right.  It could have been a really, it could have been a nice, it could have been a nice surprise  or a very, very, very big disappointment when you got them back home to your crib.  Much like the rapist walking into your room.  Yeah.  Nice surprise or awful.  Really don't know what you're going to get when you take off the bathing suit dress.  That's a big thing.  Well, the guys had to wear those wacky ones, too.  It was the straps over the shoulders, one piece. 
[01:13:30]  It had to be striped.  And had the stripes.  Yeah, it had to be striped for some reason.  And you had the big Raleigh Fingers mustache going.  You think they kicked you off the beach if you didn't have that crazy mustache and the  striped bathing suit?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And you had to carry big barbells with you with big circular weights, big spherical weights  on the end of it.  100 written on it.  Yeah, with 100 whoops written on it.  I'm such a downer.  I've got to bring back a memory.  Remember, we used to eat at the Brooklyn Diner a lot after our other show? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Or before our other show there?  I like the Brooklyn Diner.  I just don't like the prices.  I've never paid $35 for a chicken pot pie in my life.  And then there's a wall.  And the whole wall is a picture of Coney Island.  Coney Island, back in the day.  It had to be, what year?  Like 1920-something?  Probably, yeah, 20s.  Tops, right?  Yeah.  I think it was even before then.  And everyone's really happy.  And you see all sorts of people.  Like, it had to be hundreds of thousands of people.  It must have been some big thing they were doing down there. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  On the beach.  And I look at Anthony.  And I go, Anthony, what do all those people now have in common?  Oh, boy.  They're all dead.  But then there was a little kid up front that might still be.  Yeah, then we had hope for that one little kid.  Drooling.  That one little kid.  We're like, well.  Drooling in a nursing home somewhere, remembering Coney Island.  Because then Anthony's challenging me on my theory.  He's like, well, look at that little boy right there.  He could be 86 years old now, still alive. 
[01:15:00]  Up on Daddy's shoulders in the picture.  Right.  Yeah.  Could be.  I remember Coney Island.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  In the end, kid's life just sucks.  That was it.  And then we're also looking through thinking, how many of these guys, like, just, or this  kid over here croaked on the beaches of Normandy or something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, the wars.  Of course.  Oh, just awful.  Great.  Nice picture.  It's supposed to be a real picker-upper.  It's a big Fourth of July party.  Coney Island from the 20s or maybe even early 30s. 
[01:15:30]  I'm not sure what it was, but it's supposed to be like a fun thing.  And me and Opie, we're fired from our job, so we're just sitting there depressed looking  at it, making it the worst picture ever.  Yeah.  We can't even find fun out of it.  Like, wow, those people really look like they're enjoying themselves.  No.  They're all dead now.  Yeah.  That young kid is in a home.  That guy probably lost his leg at Anzio.  Yeah.  There was a fat lady, I remember, with her swimming dress on.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You know, the medical crap they had back then. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, please.  That young lady probably dropped out of a massive heart attack.  Oh, of course.  Only a couple years after this picture was taken.  Tops.  After they put leeches on her to cure her.  Archaic crap.  All right.  Back to Coco the Killer Clown, Anthony.  Well, that's where we went.  So, Coco the Killer Clown is another member of this family that was being mocked.  But he's not being mocked because he's a big star in the family.  I don't understand it.  He's been a family friend for years, said Coco.  I don't know how he could do this to my mom and my sister.  It's like a kick in the ass, said Coco, currently on hiatus from performing after undergoing back surgery. 
[01:16:30]  When I come to New York, I'd like to have a talk with him, he said.  Yeah, he's going to show him.  But despite his homicidal stage name, Coco insisted he would never use his 4'3", 160-pound frame to inflict punishment on this guy.  160?  4'3", 160.  Wow.  I weigh about 165.  Is he built?  I doubt it.  Or just fat?  I would have to say... 
[01:17:00]  Why is he a killer clown?  I would have to say a lot of the weight's in his butt.  A lot of weight in his butt.  They keep that low center of gravity.  Yeah, midgets don't have a lot of weight in their arms and legs for the most part.  Not because they're short.  Yeah, so it's probably gut and butt.  I would help anybody, but not hurt anybody, he said.  The trouble between Coco's mom and sister and Izzo began roughly three weeks ago when the 40-year-old former friend spread rat poison on the street, according to Shea.  Shea objected and her pleas were met with a three-week barrage of insults. 
[01:17:30]  Why did he spread rat poison?  I guess there was probably a rat problem in the neighborhood, so he's, I guess, doing the neighborly thing.  He decides to just spread rat poisoning all over the streets.  I'm sure there's kids playing, so it's probably not the best idea.  So the midget mouthed off to him.  Yeah, the midget mother's like, what the F are you doing?  And then this guy decided to abuse the family for the next three weeks.  Was she afraid her mongrel daughter was going to pick them up and eat them?  And both races will be destroyed.  And that's pretty much it, I guess. 
[01:18:00]  Coco was baffled by Izzo's behavior.  Used the rats for transportation.  Yeah, that's about it.  Killer clown is bad.  Wow, that's a whole family of midgets, huh?  Yeah.  Is the father a midget, too?  Still no sign of the father.  I guess one of these, you know, it's like a 50-50 shot.  If you have a fidget, then you've got a normal-sized person, and they have sex and the woman gets pregnant, 
[01:18:30]  you've got a 50-50 shot of it being a normal-sized person or a midget.  How do you know that, Anthony?  I just picked it up somewhere.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Yeah, I saw it on a special on the HBO, the midget special.  Yeah, I got a 50-50 shot.  The doctor.  Do you know if you...  Yeah, the doctor. 
[01:19:00]  The doctor.  There was a doctor, a midget doctor, and he was married to a normal-sized woman.  And she got pregnant, and they were wondering, you know, 50-50 shot.  I wonder if it's going to come out normal-sized or have to go through the hell that the midget went through.  Nice selfish parents, right?  You've got a 50-50 shot of having a midget.  You pretty much don't have kids.  And they tested, and the kid came out, and fidget.  It had to be a midget.  That whole 50-50 thing with the midget, no way.  I don't believe it at all.  You think it's just always, always? 
[01:19:30]  I think it's mostly midget.  But you know what the thing has got to be?  When that kid popped out in the delivery room, you know the mother was like,  You motherfucker.  You son of a bitch.  You and your awful DNA.  I've got to deal with you, and now I've got a kid.  And he probably wouldn't make eye contact with her, like, look, our baby.  But we all know who to blame is.  There's no one else you can blame.  I know a little something about genetics, Anthony.  As long as it's got ten cocktail franks, I'm happy.  I'm going to tell me.  Yeah, counting the cocktail frank fingers. 
[01:20:00]  Ten Manx cat tail fingers.  My little nubs.  Yeah, I know a little something about genetics.  You do?  Yeah.  If you have blue eyes and your wife has blue eyes, the kid's going to have blue eyes.  Right.  Thank you.  It's not always true, though, Opie.  Oh, no.  That one's true.  No.  Oh, yes, it is.  Cigars and scotch from whackbag.com.  I have a working theory on this.  I think.  Even if the guy was on medication for 30 years, you don't just wig out like that. 
[01:20:30]  I think he had a midget fetish.  Maybe he watched, like, Bridget the Midget videos and thought, you know, I'm going to try that.  Hits hunter, gets rejected, and can you imagine the humiliation and the shame?  Of being rejected sexually by a midget?  Yeah.  Well, that's the problem, is this guy, if a midget rejects you sexually, it is actually  in the law books, you can just grab it by the head and fuck its mouth.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Bubba Bowie.  Bubba Bowie. 
[01:21:00]  Bubba Bowie.  Opie, I'm not sure about the blue eye, blue eye, blue eye thing.  Uh-oh.  Not sure.  Why?  Because there could be a parent with blue eyes and brown eyes, and they have a kid.  Now, blue is a recessive gene.  Okay.  Brown is the dominant.  All right.  Of the eye gene.  But I said blue eye, blue eye.  Yeah, but if there is blue eyes, kid blue eyes.  But if the parent's parents, one of them has a brown eye, you could get that dominant gene.  I'm sure one of them does. 
[01:21:30]  I'm sure.  Don't we all have a brown eye?  Oh, stop you.  So let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, what's up?  What's up, bro?  I used to live next door to my backyard.  I used to back up to a small person's house.  And what happened was they used to go rake the leaves in the front, and I guess it was  about a four-foot wall.  You wouldn't even see that.  You'd just see the top of the rakes popping up and down.  All right.  And the shovels. 
[01:22:00]  But here's the thing.  I swear to God.  She had a daughter that was a beautiful girl.  She was gorgeous.  I mean, drop-dead gorgeous.  And it was her daughter.  They actually looked like her.  But the thing was, she was full size.  She was about 5'8".  She was tall, even for a girl.  And she was smoking.  Yeah.  I swear to God.  Swear to God.  And here's another funny story.  Uh-oh.  The woman came home from work one day, and it was dark in the backyard.  And some big black dude tried to grab her purse, dragged her halfway up the driveway 
[01:22:30]  before he realized, I guess, she was holding on.  I thought he had more to that, but that was it.  That was it.  Come on.  That didn't party.  You know what?  Hold on.  I'm kind of with the guy.  I don't think you should have got the car crash.  Yeah.  That's kind of funny.  He didn't realize that she was still on the, uh...  You got the car crash, but I'm defending you, bro.  I think...  I gave him a car crash more for the delivery.  He just kind of ended it, and then went... 
[01:23:00]  Come on.  I'm all my truth.  You're not a comedian.  There's nothing wrong with finding a little humor in your joke.  The guy enjoyed his joke.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  There it goes.  There it goes, Jeff.  Let's go to Tom in Texas.  Tom, what's up?  Not so much.  I think you guys are missing the real point in the story.  Okay.  Okay.  The point of the story is, here's a three-six-foot-tall girl hopping on four-and-a-half-foot cock.  I'm out.  He's, uh, talking about the black...  The black...  Oh.  That deserved a crash. 
[01:23:30]  Dante.  Yeah.  What's up, Boney?  Save this bidder.  We got to move on.  All right.  Hey.  Bob Kelly crying right now after reading that article?  Get out, Maverick.  Good callback for the old listeners.  Fucking faggot, Dante.  Well, I guess really fast.  Norton, uh, Bob Kelly, one of his...  Well, he's a friend of all of ours, a comedian, and he's an emotional...  I found him!  He's an emotional wreck.  And there was a program on HBO about dwarfs or midgets or something. 
[01:24:00]  It was just...  Bob is such a boob.  I was in his apartment watching the midget special, and the one...  The noise we always go...  There's a little one, and she was like three-foot-something.  I mean, like...  She was the smallest midget I've ever seen on TV, in real life, or anything.  If I met her in person, I would pick her up and bite her.  Yeah, you have to.  I would just sink my teeth into her mid-back.  Just bite her and hold her like that.  And...  Just shake your head a little bit.  Her little fat hands and feet would kick. 
[01:24:30]  Well, she got engaged to her boyfriend, and he, like, popped the question in front of her awful family.  Yeah.  And she was like...  And she was trying to put her awful, tiny-nailed fingers over her mouth, but they just kind of tapped the side of her little fat, awful face.  And her arms were so short, and her shoulders so wide apart, with that deformed body, that she tried to, like any normal person would do, when you open up that engagement ring box, and you see the ring, like she was trying to put her hands over her mouth and go, ooh, like that. 
[01:25:00]  But her hands just barely, the tips of those nubs, barely brushed her cheeks.  So she's trying, and her hands are shaking, right on the side of her head, and she went, ooh, so happy that she's actually being accepted by somebody.  Just the love she was feeling, and I'm fucking, I'm howling.  Of course.  At these awful hummingbird wing hands, just fluttering and just touching nothing but a little bit of fat cheek.  And I look over, and that fat Middle Eastern idiot is bawling like a baby. 
[01:25:30]  He's crying over that.  Dude, doesn't he say...  I'm like, what the fuck is the matter with you?  This is hilarious.  Oh, my God.  You blubbering idiot.  He actually got emotional over that.  Oh.  It was the HBO Dwarf special.  I was crying, too, but it was tears of laughter.  I couldn't stop laughing.  Absolutely.  Whoa.  Hey, here's the first clip from the HBO Dwarf special. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, we got it.  Six months later, we're finally playing this.  Yeah.  Old midget talking about how his parents wanted nothing to do with him.  It shows him shirtless and shaving.  Yeah, this is a, ooh.  This was, because they kind of highlighted a few midgets on the show and followed them through their daily activities.  Some are doing very well, like the doctor.  Others, not so good.  This is why I go the other way and laugh openly at stuff.  Yeah.  Because you know damn well HBO's doing this Dwarf special, okay?  And they're talking to this old midget, which is sad to begin with. 
[01:26:30]  Yep.  You just think about his life and how tough it was and blah, blah, blah.  But HBO, it's not good enough for HBO or anyone else that's going to throw this special together.  Right.  So they're like, hey, maybe it would be a good idea to film the Dwarf, you know, with no shirt on, shaving.  Yeah.  Take your shirt off.  Like it's not bad enough.  They want to make it as horrific as possible.  Uh-huh.  So then you, the stupid viewer at home, not you, I mean the people that don't listen to the program,  they're the stupid ones that really, you know, go with something like this and feel the emotion. 
[01:27:00]  Morons.  You know, then you, yeah, exactly.  You feel the emotion and you're affected by something like this.  But here's the old midget.  He looked just like an Oompa Loompa, by the way.  Oh, really?  One of those midgets that like could have just put orange paint on his face and look exactly like an Oompa Loompa.  All right, let's go to the clip.  When I was born, I was born different because I'm small.  And when the doctors saw me born different, they said they didn't think I'd live beyond 10 years old because I was born different. 
[01:27:30]  This was 1941 I was born.  A midget in 41.  My mother, she, she was very scared and she, she didn't want to be ashamed to have me around with her.  This picture here shows you when I went to the training school when I was five years old.  I see all the kids have families that they come up to see them, they come up, take them home. 
[01:28:00]  And I, I, I never have families do that.  I am a dwarf and they couldn't understand why I was born like this.  The dramatic music.  The dramatic music.  Just in case you're not crying yet.  Yeah, he was a real old midget.  Born in 41.  And you know how tolerant people were in the 40s of stuff like that.  Get it away. 
[01:28:30]  Don't let it touch me.  Yeah, keep it away.  Better known as the good old days.  Ah, the good old days.  His parents abandoned him and like sent him to this school for kids like him.  And he grew up and became some laborer at some bed and breakfast.  And then what they do is actually bring him to his mom to introduce him to his mother again after all these years.  Because his mother's still alive.  Do they?  Oh boy.  Yeah.  Is that what's coming up on, I don't remember that part.  I don't know.  I don't know if they have that.  I'm just commenting. 
[01:29:00]  It was pretty gruesome.  Oof.  It's called the good old days because back then you were allowed to react like a human being.  Mm-hmm.  Nowadays everyone is, you know, so politically correct.  And they try to tell you that you're not supposed to react when you see like, you know, somebody that doesn't look like you.  So, you don't remember that part where he went to like meet up with his mother?  No, he described a meeting with his mother where he had gone years later and she rejected him and told him to go away.  But he didn't, they don't show.  Didn't they show the apartment and everything?  Yes, but they don't show the mother. 
[01:29:30]  The mother might be, I think the mother's dead.  They do show the, um.  Oh, maybe I got confused because I saw the apartment.  They showed like the apartment.  Yeah, and he's going, and I went to visit my mother, you know, this awful voice and he just sounds dumb.  At least the midget doctor is a doctor, but this guy just sounds like a dope.  Back at 74, I found out where my mother lived in New York. 
[01:30:00]  She lived in a very rich apartment.  The apartment was rich.  And when I went to see her, I went up the third floor to see her. 
[01:30:30]  And when I rang the doorbell, and when she saw her.  How did he ring the doorbell?  Oh, oh.  How did he ring the doorbell?  The stick.  He asked the black guy holding the pizza to ring it for him.  Can you just ring this, please?  And when she saw me there, she was totally a shot.  She says to me, Rob, what are you doing here? 
[01:31:00]  You're not supposed to be leaving Connecticut.  You can't come here.  I can't take care of you.  I don't think I was in there a car for fun.  Ever since then, I have no use for the parents whatsoever.  To me, they were not.  When they died a few years ago, I had no feelings whatsoever. 
[01:31:30]  Sorry to say that, but that's the way it is.  He's acting like he's striking back.  They didn't care about you either, stupid.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe if you weren't such a bad boy.  Such a bad, short boy.  He went in 74.  That means he was 33.  Yeah.  And his mother's like, I can't take care of you.  You're not supposed to leave Connecticut.  Yeah.  She tells.  Where was that law?  There was a law back then.  Right.  All midgets are to stay in Connecticut.  You know that she told him that when she left. 
[01:32:00]  Like, I don't want to have to leave you, but you can't leave Connecticut, and I have to.  New law just being passed.  All midgets are to stay in Connecticut.  Connecticut.  The land of the dwarf.  Remember, if you're a genetic disaster, and you give birth to one of these freaks with cocktail  pranks for fingers, bring him to Connecticut.  You'll get a free carton of Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Now, what would you rather have, the refreshing taste of a Lucky, or some disaster screwing 
[01:32:30]  up your family photo?  Of course, you'll take the Lucky.  So drop off your mess in Connecticut, and tell them they are not to leave under any circumstances.  Dice had a really funny bit about fucking driving his car and hitting the midget, and  the cop pulled him over.  He's like, you hit a midget, and he's like, oh, I thought it was a big bird. 
[01:33:00]  Well, I thought it was a big bird.  Dehumanizing him.  Oh, you'll clean that up, right?  Yeah, go ahead.  No one saw it.  He don't care.  Big birds.  You hit a midget.  Well, I thought it was a bird.  What happened?  What happened?  What?  With my car.  That is funny.  Oh, bravo.  With their big fucking heads. 
[01:33:30]  All right, we got the girl from the HBO Dwarf special, Anthony.  This is the recap of her childhood.  Yeah.  There were days when I went.  Listen to that voice.  She is like you put a human being in a trash compactor, and she lived.  Yeah, she's awful.  It's just all, like, compressed.  And that voice.  Eh. 
[01:34:00]  How does she masturbate?  Hmm.  I'll bet you she puts her face in the pillow, and then just puts her awful torso on the bed,  and her little rotten legs together, and just humps.  Things just like a little, like a chihuahua.  Yeah.  She probably wraps around a chair leg, and just humps her awful little crotch.  Yeah, because they can't reach their own crotches.  No.  How does she wipe her crack?  Oh, yeah.  How do they wipe their cheeks?  It's got to be rough.  Little midget ass stinking up the whole apartment.  She probably does something where she bends over, like, really far, and gets her hand down there, maybe. 
[01:34:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, maybe they take toilet paper, and they put it around the plunger, and then sit on it and stand quickly.  Yeah, that could work.  Use the stick they use to ring doorbells with.  Wipe some toilet paper on it.  These are the questions we want answered if you're going to do a special on this stuff.  How do they do everyday things?  Yeah.  There were days when I'm different.  I'm different.  That's terrific.  God, I wish I could be tall. 
[01:35:00]  Third grade.  Wanted to be a cheerleader.  Really?  And also wanted to play basketball.  Play basketball or be a cheerleader.  Yeah.  Just pick two things that are impossible.  Yeah.  Stop it.  What else did you want to do?  Be on a string bean can, you deluded whore?  I just wanted to be the Toys R Us mascot.  Come on.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:35:30]  Why don't you just settle for...  I just wanted to be something that people didn't want to throw up and kick when they saw...  I'm all for trying to be the best you could be, but I mean, stop.  There's a million other things you could have done and no one would have noticed.  Nobody would have noticed.  The height thing.  How about this?  I just didn't want to be 30 looking like I belonged in diapers.  Couldn't you have settled for that?  Cheerleader.  She wants to be.  Or play basketball.  She could be the ball.  That'd be interesting.  Whoa!  Go team!  Yuck. 
[01:36:00]  I'd lose if it's shut up.  I'd rather have the guys from the longest yard cheering for me.  I can believe that.  Yes.  My parents supported anything I wanted to do.  My parents supported any ideas that I had.  Of course.  When Martha was born, there were doctors who would say,  she needs to be institutionalized.  And then some doctor would walk around the corner and say, 
[01:36:30]  don't listen to them.  That's not true.  That's true.  This baby has got all the potential in the world.  You take her.  You take her home.  You love her.  And you raise her.  And it will all fall into place.  I didn't know this girl's mother was Joaquin Phoenix.  She said, don't you listen to those, buddy.  Don't you listen.  There's no need to put her in the institution.  She's got all the potential in the world.  Just put makeup on her and rent her out at parties.  Joaquin is in rehab.  Yes, he is. 
[01:37:00]  Your favorite actor is in rehab.  I have a problem with drugs.  I have a problem with drugs.  Mother fucking, I have a problem with drugs.  What?  I've been calling for 17 years.  I don't need to drink or drug because I've got no acting ability to fall back on.  What?  What?  I'm false.  Mother really supported her.  Of course.  All right, hold on.  We've got to go to Nicole in Atlanta.  Nicole.  Hey, guys. 
[01:37:30]  What's up?  Listen, I heard you guys talking about how they wipe back there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I know how.  How?  How?  I used to work for this company, and that's all they did was provide, like, ways for paralyzed  people, crippled people to go to the bathroom.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding.  And what is it?  Well, they make this special stick.  It's curved.  It's especially for wiping your ass if you're, like, really fat.  Oh.  Or if you don't have arms long enough to reach back there.  Oh, wipe your ass a stick. 
[01:38:00]  Yes.  You wind the toilet paper around one end of the stick.  It's really curved.  And I guess you stick it between your legs and just do your thing.  What was the name of the company?  You should have killed yourself and cooperated?  Well, you know what?  It wasn't anything like that, but everybody there had a really good attitude about, you  know, still being lucky to be alive.  But, like, sometimes you did, no, sometimes you did think that, like, why didn't they  just kill themselves?  No, they should have what?  Yeah, what should they have done, eh? 
[01:38:30]  I said they should get Panzerfaust, that they could buy one of their songs and have it  incorporated to the product.  You're paralyzed, use a shit stick!  You're a fidget, use a shit stick!  Or a stick with toilet paper is not a hat.  All right, guys, well, I'm punching out.  Thanks for the info.  There you go.  I just want to go fucking crazy with you.  I just want to wipe your ass with a stick.  If you want that, just put your hands to your face and go, ooh. 
[01:39:00]  You are so fucking short.  She was just the greatest kid you ever wanted to have.  Oh, sure.  She was feisty.  If it were just a matter of being short, that might have been one thing.  But with diastrophic dwarfism, not only are their hands small, the joints are fused. 
[01:39:30]  Joints are fused.  Plus the thumb floats.  Floating thumb.  She has no real grip at all.  Floating thumb, people.  And that has been the biggest challenge.  To be an independent person was our goal with her.  But there were always that handful of teachers who could not get beyond the fact that Martha was not the average child.  Martha, you can't do this. 
[01:40:00]  She clenches her hands.  Don't even think about it.  Well, Martha wouldn't accept that.  We wouldn't accept that.  She's got floating thumbs.  She can't bend her thumbs, so she can't grip.  She grips between her four fingers and the palm of her little hand is how she's got to grip.  But most of the time, she grips with both hands.  Like if she was going to drink something, she has to grab it with both hands flat and bring it up to her face because her bones are all fused in her hand and she's got that floating thumb. 
[01:40:30]  You could take the thumb and just, it's like a bobblehead thumb.  It's not attached to anything.  It's just kind of, so when she was going, ooh, they were shaking around.  Her little thumbs were shaking.  What a disaster.  How short were her arms?  T-Rex.  Think T-Rex.  Come on.  She had these little T-Rex arms.  Yeah.  It's as if, take your arm from the elbow and attach it to your shoulder.  Wow.  That's what she had going.  Yeah.  Little things like that.  Everyone's trying it. 
[01:41:00]  And she did that wiggle walk thing where the legs are just such a mess that you're going back and forth when you walk.  She wasn't even hot.  She had a long, fat, wide face.  Yeah.  And the boyfriend's a midget, too?  Yeah, but he was a taller midget.  He was tall for a midget.  Midgets look at him and go, wow, you're pretty tall.  What was he, four or five?  Yeah, he just fit into midget category.  And there they were, like, in the kitchen.  She's cooking.  She, like, has to climb a ladder no matter what she's trying to get to.  It's like the ladder goes around. 
[01:41:30]  She climbs up it.  He's got to run around and get her stuff from places that are too high.  Gosh.  And he liked the fact that she depended on him.  Like, that was one of the things.  Because nobody else ever looked at this guy for anything in his life.  No.  Other than a good place to slap.  Yeah, that's why.  He was like, great.  Now I'm the big man on campus.  That's exactly what it is.  He'd hand her little things that she couldn't get out of the drawer.  After she cooks, it must look like a crime scene every night.  Do you think she's messy?  Oh, my.  How could you not be?  How is she cleaning up?  With those hands.  I don't know.  Imagine you go over there to eat and know she's been handling the food. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Little fat Mickey Mouse hands.  Check the spaghetti.  She just digs her hands in there.  Oh, here you go.  Here's a pinch of salt.  She's got to put it between her palms.  Oh, and then you're just looking like, oh.  Oh, have some cake.  Oh, I got my fingers in it.  That's okay.  But no one wants to say anything.  I love when people assume they can just maul your food.  A couple of times, get in room service at the hotel, and these animals will come and  deliver your food for you from some faraway country, and they wheel it up, and they insist 
[01:42:30]  on taking the tops off of the food, and sometimes they grab in through that hole in the top  of the metal thing over your plate, and put a finger mark in your mashed potatoes.  Yes, Howard Hughes.  You know what I got to do?  Throw it away.  Yes, Howard Hughes.  We all can relate to that.  It's not a Howard Hughes thing.  It's an animal's finger in my mashed potatoes.  You're throwing way too much shit away.  Yeah, Miss Fancy.  What happened?  You didn't tell them to bring it to the other room of the suite?  Their fingers brushed your potatoes in your room service?  Okay.  Why wouldn't you at that point some filthy beast that probably doesn't wipe? 
[01:43:00]  This is why I'm starting to think you're more and more like Howard Hughes every day.  Okay.  I understand the dilemma to a point.  All right, so now you've got a print in your mashed potatoes, let's say.  Why wouldn't you at that point maybe take a utensil and just scrape that part off the  mashed potatoes and get rid of it if you're that paranoid?  When I've been hungry, I have done that.  Why would you throw the whole thing away?  No, I have done that.  I've scraped it off, but I scrape a lot off.  It's just, the point is not how crazy I am.  The point is, the guy should watch out. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, no, it's about how crazy you are.  No, we're going to have a whole show on that soon when you're feeling it.  He should be, he should understand I don't want his fingers in my food.  Why are you now broadcasting from a plastic bubble?  Well, there are germs in here.  I have to.  I roll in and out.  It's not taking up too much studio room, the bubble.  Hey, John Travolta, you're going to risk it all and take a walk outside to smell the  spring air?  I'm going to go outside.  I'm in my bubble.  Boy, I'm in a plastic bubble. 
[01:44:00]  What an ass.  That was his big dramatic role.  Look, I'm in a bubble.  Wasn't that the final scene where he's going to take a chance and live?  Yeah.  And then he walks outside?  Yep.  Out of his safe environment?  I think, no, they put him in a walking suit.  Didn't they put him in like a space suit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was able to walk around?  At first, but then he realizes he needs to truly live, I believe.  Yeah.  That was the dramatic moment.  Then he's walking without any protection.  I'm, Mr. Cotta, I'm getting out of my bubble.  And then what happened?  He took a walk?  What happened? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  I think that's how it ends, knowing that it's probably not going to turn out too good.  It's probably going to catch that cold.  Probably some dirty Asian sneezed in his face.  Give him the SIDS.  The SIDS?  Or the, what is it called?  Yeah.  Sun-infant death syndrome.  I didn't know SIDS was contagious.  Hey, look.  You've got to put John to sleep on his back.  The SIDS.  What a tool.  How do you think he caught that fatal disease? 
[01:45:00]  Could have been a bird just pooping on his head as he's trying to enjoy his day in the  backyard.  Yeah, where did that germ come from?  Probably some animal room service guy putting his finger in his mashed potatoes.  That one little germ.  That is it all.  All right, back to the, ooh, girl.  Well, this clip is about her saying she'll never be a model.  I am three feet tall, and I just want to be shorter, little people.  But if I could wave a magic wand, I would not wave it to be tall. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, no?  My experiences have been extremely unique because of my height.  Stop taking lemons and making lemonade, you little liar.  If I had a magic wand in a second.  That's right.  Either that or wave it so everyone in the world is even shorter than you.  So you can make fun of me.  See you, motherfucker.  If I had a magic wand, I'd just smack her in the face with it and go, ha ha.  That's such the courageous thing to say, though.  Bullshit.  It is bullshit.  I wouldn't change a thing. 
[01:46:00]  If I had a magic wand, I'd wave it and I'd have washboard abs and a great chin.  And I'd never need to do comedy because I'd just be getting blown all the time.  I would change everything.  Fucking liar.  Wave that magic wand.  I wouldn't change a thing.  And you think they're off to the side just going, you go, girl.  Yeah.  You tell them.  You tell HBO.  People are going to see your story and be inspired.  Ugh.  Yeah.  To buy condoms so you don't have that fucking awful atrocity running around your living room.  I think he, John Travolta, it says, I think he walked out on his own and rode a horse with his girlfriend. 
[01:46:30]  That's right.  Was that it?  Yeah, because horses aren't that dirty.  When he goes horseback riding and jumps a fence, that's it.  I hear he's hooking up with Dreamweaver by the riverbed.  That's real smart.  You're going to take a chance.  Maybe the first thing isn't jumping on a horse.  You know what I mean?  Maybe you should just start with just an enjoyable walk around the yard, praying that nothing poops on you.  Why are you jumping on a horse?  That's right.  Through the woods where there's deer ticks. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Look at this guy trying to get me.  Hey, Ann, I work on ATM machines, and I watch people insert their card, pick their nose, punch their pin numbers in, and then you use the machines.  Yeah, I do.  I know.  What am I going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  If I see it, you know, that's when I get really crazy.  That's when you can totally put the lunatic label on me is the stuff that I start doing that I don't see.  That could be dirty.  Well, Jason from Alabama wants in, Anthony.  He knows how midgets wipe their butts. 
[01:47:30]  Alabama.  Let's go to Jason.  Hey, Jason.  Hey, how we doing, guys?  What's up, Jay?  Hey, go make that whole ass wiping concept.  I think they just drag themselves across the carpet like a dog.  You think their legs go up by their ears, and they just kind of pull themselves around with their hands?  It's called scooting, actually, when dogs do that.  Scooting.  Toolbag Johnson from New Orleans.  If I had a magic wand, I'd put some toilet tissue on it and wipe my ass. 
[01:48:00]  We have a very sympathetic audience.  Back to the club.  I was of my height.  I see everything, but I don't really care anymore.  Cutting these dead spots out.  Who did this? 
[01:48:30]  I don't know.  What did we learn on this show?  Editing.  Well, no, we haven't learned that yet.  Someday we'll learn editing.  Although this is something that was put together about six months ago for us.  Yeah, maybe they've learned since then.  Sure.  Who put it together?  Who would leave these just blank moments of noise, background noise, knowing, well, that's the visual.  I'm sure she's walking around.  Yeah, the visual's probably great right there.  Walking around Manhattan, looking at all the tall buildings and the tall people.  Everything taller than her.  Sure.  But on radio, I got to kind of use a few words. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, people are just sitting there going, what is this?  Oh, what is it?  Eric?  Eric?  Eric?  Did you edit this, Eric?  No.  Wow, they're...  Be honest.  They just threw you under the bus.  They're selling you out.  Steve, who edited this?  Wait, let me explain what happened.  We get little messages in our headphones every once in a while.  And the other room that's filled with all the interns just threw Eric under the bus and said,  Eric, put this whole thing together.  Steve, Martín, Steve?  I didn't even know you were here today.  Hey, Steve, how are you?  I'm feeling...  I think I'm...  Uh-huh.  Stupid microphone. 
[01:49:30]  What happened?  I got allergies or something.  What?  Hold up, Steve.  What are you doing?  God, stupid thing.  Is this anything?  Uh-huh, he knocks the cover off it.  Put it back.  Are you all right?  I got...  I think I'm having some allergy attack or something like that.  Wow, you sound great.  Yeah, I don't know.  What are you allergic to, editing?  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, if I actually handed this in, I would have laughed at that, but it's not mine.  I didn't do this.  Who did this?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I know Eric pulled a piece, but I know I pulled a piece, but this isn't the one I did.  Oh. 
[01:50:00]  Oh.  The fairy fucking godmother edited it.  Oh, dude, I take credit for all my screw-ups.  Oh, shit.  I didn't do this one.  The fucking editor.  All right, well...  Who edited this piece?  Who the fuck edited this piece?  They're paying for it.  You listen to it.  Steve, thanks for adding to the program today.  You called me in here.  It's allergic, Steve.  God, yeah, you ain't kidding me.  Look at your eyes, man.  They're all puffy.  Yeah, I'm allergic to something.  I don't know what, though.  So, I'm just walking around wondering why I feel like crap.  I have a million...  Exactly. 
[01:50:30]  I have a million things you could be allergic to, but I'll just stop right there.  Yes, just leave that in your head, Opie.  Because we're going on too many...  Hops and yeast, maybe.  We're going on too many tangents as is.  So, I backed up a little bit here, Anthony, because what we learned on this program is as  soon as you say you don't care about something, you really do care.  Right.  And she's saying how she doesn't care about being tall.  She doesn't care.  I have accepted that I am not going to be a model. 
[01:51:00]  Come on.  She's accepted that.  Don't you have to have it run through your head for a second before you can accept something?  We all go through life probably, I don't know, sophomore.  Sophomore year, I think it starts, and they give you that thing, what you might be good  at.  Uh-huh.  There's things you're just not checking off.  Right. 
[01:51:30]  At all.  You're not even considering it.  Why are you checking off the one that says model?  Model.  Might be a good career direction for you.  Why?  Model.  Yeah.  Well, she's accepted that.  That's brave.  All right.  She's so obsessed with being short that she wants to prove everybody wrong, so she's going  for things that dwarfs and midgets don't go after.  Right.  Being models.  Being a cheerleader.  Basketball player.  Basketball player.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:52:00]  She's got some mental issues.  Be a scrubbing bubble.  Or anything thereof, I have accepted that I don't even look as attractive as some other  people, even in the same position that I'm in, but I don't care.  You're ugly.  I don't care.  She doesn't care.  I just don't care.  She doesn't care, guys.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over. 
[01:52:30]  I don't care.  She doesn't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I know, Howard.  You don't care.  I don't care.  She's ugly.  Really?  She couldn't even say ugly.  She had to say, I'm not as attractive as other people in the same position.  Just say it.  Mm-hmm.  You are humbly.  Now, this girl was a teacher, Anthony?  Yes.  She'd walk in, and these poor students would have to deal with that on a daily basis.  What did she teach?  How distracting. 
[01:53:00]  I don't remember.  Was it art class?  Some meaningless class.  It was some meaningless class.  You're right.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Same thing as last.  I can't fucking hear.  You've got any problems with the sound quality.  Is there any way to turn up your headphone volume?  No, it's not that.  It's an underwater thing.  I know the listeners are annoyed with bitch, but I can't hear.  I'm talking to you.  It sounds awful.  So, you like how that mic sounds.  You don't want to move over there, right?  Probably because they put the filter back in here or something.  You don't want to move over there?  No.  Okay.  So, someone has to talk to Wiki. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  And that's not a speech impediment.  That's his nickname with a W.  Ooh.  And just make that microphone your microphone over there.  Yeah, I don't know why this sounds a lot.  That sounds perfect.  That sounds great.  Guys, a little show idea.  The Norwegian Dawn is arriving in New York.  I'm sure that there will be lots of news coverage down at the pier here in Manhattan.  Yeah, on the west side.  Lots of news coverage.  Lots of live shots.  Lots of interviews with these people down there.  You've got to go down there, people. 
[01:54:00]  If you're in New York, assault on the media.  You get in front of those cameras, hold up wows or something.  You bring in your clip.  You know, you have a friend at home recorded or something.  Get some kind of proof, even digital camera, of you doing it.  We'll give you something.  We'll toss you something.  You come down, sit in on the show, and hang out.  Yeah.  But this is a perfect opportunity.  This story is huge.  The ship, they just showed a live shot of it coming up the river.  So, here comes your opportunity.  It's a great opportunity.  We'll get into that story in a little bit. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, I can't wait.  It's another great, great story.  Yes, Jimmy?  Why don't we have anybody going down?  Do we have anybody here that can go down with a sign?  It's a beautiful day out.  We really should.  I don't know when exactly it's coming in.  Yeah, someone's got to let us know when the ship's going to come in,  and they're going to start doing their live reports from down there.  Probably the noon news here in New York.  Probably, yeah.  What's this coming in?  Is it coming in right now?  They just showed a live shot of it coming up the river.  Maybe someone can help us out with that, because we're just looking at the pictures on the TV.  We don't know the details of that.  All right, so the ooh girl talking about her job as a teacher. 
[01:55:00]  I teach in a public middle school.  It's actually at-risk kids.  Criminals.  The first week, they're petrified.  They have no idea how to react.  They either stare, or they look somewhere else the whole time.  I think they're showing her class.  And if I'm turned, I know that they're looking at me really hard. 
[01:55:30]  It was a couple of midgets that live in my neighborhood, so I was kind of used to it.  And I heard all the stories about it and all that stuff.  So when I came in 6th grade, I was expecting to see the midgetown little person.  See, he's been trained.  It's not a midget.  It's a little person.  It's a little person.  The little people.  The little person.  Is this a school in Connecticut, by the way?  Yeah, they keep them in Connecticut.  Connecticut!  I tell them, the correct term is a little person, or a dwarf. 
[01:56:00]  The common term is...  It's also a midget.  Why is dwarf okay, but midget not?  Midget.  They pick and choose, and it has to be of their own choosing.  That gives them empowerment.  Like, if you say midget, they go, no, dwarf.  Why?  Because I said so.  It gives them some little power base.  You shouldn't call them this.  Just call them this.  Why is one acceptable, and the other isn't? 
[01:56:30]  I don't know.  They made up those rules in Connecticut.  And why is midget a bad term?  Do you have an idea, Kev?  You're leaning forward eagerly.  Midget sounds nice.  I hate when they roll up, you know, with each other, and they're like, yo, midget, what's  up?  And if you call them midget, they get really upset.  That actually did the...  It actually...  That was funnier than the laugh at God.  That was...  I didn't want to laugh.  A funny line.  But I didn't know where he was going at first, and then that...  That wasn't that bad.  I take back my obnoxious laugh. 
[01:57:00]  That was funny.  That was a funny line.  I'm sorry, Big Kev.  But it was worth it, though, just to see Big Kev leaning in, hands on console, and then  backing up to obnoxious laugh in a car crash.  Yeah.  But it was funnier than it was.  But he had a lot of confidence.  He did.  He came forward with a lot of confidence.  All right.  Yo, midget, what's up, man?  Yo.  As you probably know, it's the M word.  Now, though, yeah.  M word.  And...  But I don't like that, because it has a negative connotation.  I'm not saying it's wrong, but it has a negative connotation, just like the N word.  Ah. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, really?  What word is she talking about?  Migger?  The N word.  The N word.  What are we, fucking children?  Yeah.  Because they're shorter than most of them, there's no reason to talk like one, you fucking  language-changing little nothing.  Why should we change the way we talk?  Just because you have to shop like Louis De Palma in the little children's section while  the Coturoys go...  She from New York is saying, what does she teach? 
[01:58:00]  Shorthand?  Meh.  All right.  We have two more clips.  The M word.  I mean, the word nigger is associated with slavery and a horrible repression of a group  of people for centuries, and they just were never forced to do labor they didn't want  to do.  But even that word is now a joke.  It is a joke, because it's used too much in the black community to make it a bad word.  Right.  Sorry.  Yeah.  It's used all the time in the black community.  If all of a sudden they stopped using it and everyone stopped using it, it would become 
[01:58:30]  one of those words that just aren't used anymore.  Right.  Sort of like, I don't know, like a 23 skidoo.  They already dumbed down that word.  Hubba hubba.  It doesn't have the power it used to have.  No.  It doesn't.  If you're walking around and every other word is that word in your community, then...  Mm-hmm.  It isn't mine.  What is that?  Wow, he talks real loud.  All right, here's the boyfriend of the...  What the hell?  Why were we hearing that?  Why were we hearing that?  Were you just talking real loud, Ben?  Who were you talking to?  I heard him through the door, which is weird.  That was weird. 
[01:59:00]  I heard him through my headphones.  That's what I thought, too.  Who were you talking to?  Maybe that door's open.  Are you kidding?  No, I was talking to Don down in Washington about Jim's mic problem.  Oh, okay, good.  Is that Don on the phone?  Is that Don on the phone?  We're going to fix it, by the way, Jack.  What are those pictures I was supposed to see?  All right, here's the deal.  So now we're up to the boyfriend of the little midget girl.  Yeah.  And then the final track is the marriage proposal that people have been waiting for.  I just fell in love with the woman that was inside her and the package that...  A tiny little woman.  That is bullshit.  That is bullshit.  Really?  That is bullshit.  This is how it works. 
[01:59:30]  Let me tell you how it works, people.  All right.  Every single person out there, I don't care who you are, you first...  I don't want to use the word fall in love, but you're attracted to a face.  You are attracted to a face, whatever that might be.  You might like a blonde with blue eyes.  You might like an Asian woman, whatever.  Then, when you get to know that person, you hope they're also cool inside and have the  good heart and all those other qualities that you're looking for.  But these people that say they fall in love without the physical attraction, they're lying 
[02:00:00]  to themselves.  The woman inside.  They're lying.  Yeah.  I don't know how they...  Just like all other animals on this planet, you look at a physical feature first.  Right.  Whatever that is, maybe you like a nice ass and add attraction to the person at first.  Then, you hope they have all the other qualities that aren't physical.  Maybe like a girl that when she takes her clothes off, it looks like, I don't know, a turkey  sitting in a pan waiting to go in for a Thanksgiving dinner. 
[02:00:30]  Don't you just picture her looking exactly like a turkey, naked?  Like the disproportioned bulky body thing, and the fat joints by the legs.  And the legs just stick straight out because they're just so awful.  Oh.  Rotten hole wide open.  Oh, little wings sticking out.  I just fell in love with the woman that was insider, and the package that it happens to be carried 
[02:01:00]  around in means very little.  Oh, really?  Martha is the first girl that I've dated in my entire life that was smaller than me.  There you go.  We have a winner.  Well, you said who is smaller than me.  Oh, that is smaller?  I think he could have stopped the first woman he's dated in his life.  Man, and how cruel are the parents?  You have a midget daughter, and your name are Martha?  Martha the Midget.  Wasn't that name retired back in 19... 
[02:01:30]  No.  Martha.  I think they retired the name Martha back in 19...  Let me do my math.  1965, that name was...  65, you think, Martha?  That name was retired, Anthony.  Not as old as Gertrude.  Gertie.  Well, look at...  That goes back to like the 30s.  Look at the list of all the names that have been retired.  Yeah.  You don't name your kid Martha.  Martha.  And I'm assuming this midget's not that old, right?  Mm-hmm.  20-something, maybe?  Yeah, yeah.  So she was born in the 80s?  Is that safe to say?  Who the hell is naming their kid Martha in the 80s? 
[02:02:00]  Martha.  We'll call her Martha.  And anything with an M is bad.  The thing you just called the midget.  Martha the Midget.  Then again, a T is bad.  Tanya Twerp.  Danielle Dwarf.  You know?  And you're not going to give her a stripper name with that body.  Tiffany Tiny?  Maybe it was good.  Summer?  Yeah.  Sandy Small?  Fucking Chandra Short? 
[02:02:30]  Penelope Pipsqueak?  You know, Donna Dominionis?  Have we ever talked about the saddest day on the Opie and Anthony program?  What?  The saddest day?  I remember.  Not the firing.  Getting fired?  No.  Those are always sad.  But an actual show we did where Anthony and I pretty much broke out of our characters and  we're like, oh God, this is not right. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  You remember?  Yeah.  It was awful.  Big Kev remembers?  It was an awful lot.  Oh, because we'll plow through this shit every day.  We don't care if you run out of the studio crying.  We don't care.  As long as it makes good radio.  Uh-oh.  I said we don't care, which means I don't care.  I don't care.  But for the most part, yeah.  We'll just plow through.  If you're going to cry and run out, oh well.  It made for great radio.  But we, uh, someone called us up and said that this girl wanted to come in.  Remember this one, Ben?  The midget stripper?  We needed a midget stripper because somebody. 
[02:03:30]  Had a fetish.  A guest had a fetish.  Who was that?  I can't remember.  Some rock guy?  Was it a rock dude?  Yeah, I don't know.  And his fetish was to see a midget dance naked.  One of the listeners will get it.  Who was that?  Our fans know more about this show than we do.  It wasn't Barry Williams, wasn't it?  No, no, no.  No.  No.  I don't remember.  Who the hell was it?  I don't know.  They wanted to see a naked midget next time they were in the studio.  Right.  So we were like, okay, we'll accommodate.  So we tried to audition them. 
[02:04:00]  And they were really hard to come up with.  Right.  So we get this call from this girl.  She says she'll come in and strip.  And she was a midget.  Or was she a dwarf?  She was, I think.  A dwarf.  I think she was more dwarf-ish.  She had that dwarf thing going.  So, uh, she comes in.  And she's very, very, very sad.  Sad eyes and everything.  But we're not thinking much about it.  We're like, ah, she strips.  Yeah.  She'll strip for us.  So she gets up on the console.  Yeah.  And we, I think we threw some music on for her. 
[02:04:30]  And of course we did.  She started.  Makes it sexy.  She starts stripping.  And, uh, next thing you know, like little tears are starting to want to rise.  Because we're just roaring.  We're like, oh my God.  Was it Jack Black?  Was it Jack Black?  Yeah.  Wait, we got the description?  And Colin, uh, Hanks.  Jack Black and Colin Hanks?  Uh, let's see.  Perverts.  Description of this download.  This is from foundrymusic.com.  Maybe Steve will, will, uh, headline this today.  Okay, well, Nicole Starr isn't quite naked in this video, but as we can see, she is bright, 
[02:05:00]  well-spoken, outgoing, and quite personable.  Watch as she mingles effortlessly with Patrice, Jack Black, and Colin Hanks.  Colin Hanks, the son of Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks, yes.  Tom Hanks, yes.  Uh, well, okay, so she was stripping in front of all these people, and all of a sudden the  tears start welling up in her eyes, and it turns out she never stripped before.  No.  I don't know what she was doing there on that day.  If she wanted to become a stripper and thought this was a good idea, she'll start on our 
[02:05:30]  program.  And I think we pretty much, like, stopped a bit.  We're like, oh, God.  Yeah, because she was just not, uh, into it.  Started crying.  Is that her?  No, that was some other.  That was Crystal Storm meets the midget.  That's another, uh, that was another one of our midget friends.  Right there, bro, Nicole Starr.  Remember she was standing up on the counter?  Some people are saying it was Dennis Leary.  Huh?  Some people are saying it was Dennis Leary that wanted the midget. 
[02:06:00]  No.  What?  Let me see.  She was what?  She was standing up on the console and walking around the console.  Yeah, she didn't even have to duck.  Like, any of the girls we've ever had dance on the console, they've had to, like, crouch  down.  Right.  Take their clothes off and crouch down.  She was standing up.  She could have been on a trampoline.  I got another description.  I got another description from FoundryMusic.com.  Some of these will be, uh, made headlines later today, probably.  Okay, I got the midget up on the console, and you think getting her to take her top off  would be fairly simple?  No. 
[02:06:30]  It must have taken Anne 10 minutes to explain that's what we wanted to see.  But then we realized she just, she just never did this before.  Nope.  Was uncomfortable.  And then she started crying.  Hmm.  And for once, Anne and I felt really, really like scum.  Canceled a bit.  Like scumbags.  Bit canceled.  We canceled it, right, Steve?  Bit off.  I think she got naked, then it was topless for a second.  Yeah, I don't think she really wanted to be there, to be honest with you.  It was hard to get her up on the console.  She had her head down, and her arms to her side the whole time, and she's just, like, 
[02:07:00]  moping.  No, she wasn't in trouble.  What a mood kill.  Yeah.  Stupid midget.  Oh, it was really sad.  We thought we were going to have a lot of fun, a great day of radio, and it just turned  out to be a disaster.  So here's more of the boyfriend talking about his midget girlfriend, and then finally the  proposal.  Are we?  More than me.  I am 4'10", and have been since I was in high school. 
[02:07:30]  I'm not a little person.  By their categories, I'm average size.  It's very refreshing to be asked to get something off a shelf because she can't reach it.  That's it.  It does give me that warm, fuzzy feeling inside that I can be her man.  Oh, my God.  That's your idea of being a man?  How about pumping a load into a dumper? 
[02:08:00]  He wants to get down canned peas.  Dummy.  That's not what being a man is.  How about blackening her eye?  That's what being a man is.  How do they lay there in bed and do that?  Like she would just be in his belly, like her face is in his belly as he's doing her.  Rotten thumbs just tickling his sides.  Can't even reach down and tickle the bag.  Nothing. 
[02:08:30]  Or she could.  And she could probably just flick her thumb and it goes, and flaps on it.  You have milk today, by the way?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  He's lactating, yes.  Let's see.  All right, so here it is, finally, the marriage proposal.  All right.  So the dude, Forten, proposes to midget lady.  Yeah.  Right in front of her parents, who are just pleased as punch that anyone accepted this freak.  And she wanted to touch her face, but she couldn't?  Yeah.  That's where the whole, you've got to go to the middle. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, she's got to cover her mouth and go, oh, she tried to do that.  Like anybody who's surprised at an engagement would, but her arms are so short, she went  to hold them up to her mouth and didn't even barely brush her cheeks with the tip of her fingers.  Just touching them.  Yeah.  May not be normal birthday kind of stuff.  Oh, man.  Birthday present.  It's an engagement ring.  It's a surprise.  Oh, my God.  Will you marry me? 
[02:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And that's when Bob Kelly lost it.  Right there.  Right there.  The ring was a washer from an eyeglass screw. 
[02:10:00]  Can you hear her awful acceptance again?  Just that one part?  Yeah, I've got to hear her cry.  Wait, the yes or wait?  Just the yes.  Yeah, the whole thing.  You want to hear the whole thing again?  I like hearing her cry.  Like, yeah.  All right, we'll go back.  We'll go back.  Here we go.  Come on.  May not be normal birthday kind of stuff.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my God.  Sounds like an infant.  Doesn't it just sound like an infant crying?  how awful  and then right after she goes 
[02:11:00]  he goes  not you  thank you Pat  and she hugs him  and her hands only come to his shoulders  yeah  she goes to hug him  and those little hands barely even reach  his shoulders  just wants to be a man  yeah  I think we hear 
[02:11:30]  oh yeah you did  sounds like the power steering pump straining  stop it  stop it  oh my god  that's what your parents said when you came out  oh my god  18 still in a passenger  in a lifetime you don't get to see too many dreams come true

[02:14:00]  on the tour bus  and Dane called saying that  Bob's all whacked out  how did he injure himself?  he hurt his leg somehow  I talked to him yesterday  this was before  he must have got injured  sometime yesterday afternoon  oh let's get Bob Kelly on the phone  we can do that after the break  alright let's do that after the break  because we finally played the HBO  Dwarf special  finally out of the way  so Bob  Bob will have some comments  because he actually cried  he cried when she started crying  he wept like some  grandmother  we also have Sean Rouse  outside the studio 
[02:14:30]  who warmed up for  for Jim Norton  in Atlantic City  I'm a little bummed out  that the crowd  didn't give your openers  a chance  because you know  I mean  Sean Rouse especially  a very very funny guy  the audience are animals  and he still kicked ass  because he just  blew off his act  and just attacked the crowd  yeah  but sometimes  you know  these guys  they think they're being funny  and they  you know  they're interrupting  these comedy shows  like man  just shut up  they think it's  yeah  they think it's like  a live radio show  where they can just  blurt shit out  a comment here and there  is fine  but over and over again 
[02:15:00]  you're really just  you know  I don't know  must rain  yeah  they do it to Chappelle too  I mean  I heard Chappelle walks off now  like  Rick James  it's like  alright  I understand  once in a while  you're going to yell something  but the problem is  some of these guys  are really smart  but some of them  have awful timing  it's like  do you realize  I'm going  one two  and  and just before three  they'll yell like  you know  Lil Conor  yeah  it's like  you no timing  motherfucker  could you shut up  right after the set up  you're ready to go  into the punchline of it  and there's some idiot 
[02:15:30]  just blurting something out  Sean handled them  I gotta tell you  you know  when we had  when we had that  two years off there  and I was just  wandering around America  seeing comedy  and just doing stupid shit  I walked to earth  I walked to earth  um  my favorite guy  that I  not that I discovered him  but in my  in my life  you know  Sean Rouse  oh my god  yeah  love the guy  absolutely love the guy  he's sick and twisted  he's not supposed to drink  because he's got all sorts  of fucked up things  wrong with him  and he  yeah  and he just drinks like 
[02:16:00]  like worse than  Martini Steve  wow  and then you see him  in the lobby  these hotels  the next morning  he can't even move  yeah  really  and he knows  what he's doing to himself  he don't give a crap  oh boy  he is dark  and twisted  he's got the dexterity  of a Redwood  remember that time  in Dallas  oh Sean's a mess  he's got  you're going to laugh at me  because I don't know  if I can pronounce it right  the rheumatoid arthritis  is that it  I think so  and so  he's got like  he's got like  knobby like elbows 
[02:16:30]  and all sorts of  things wrong with him  that he openly  talks about on stage  so I'm not  you know  I'm not  trying to poke fun  at the guy  and then  we meet him  or I guess  did you know him ahead  oh yeah  oh okay  so I meet him  for the first time  and he's talking about  this very normal  and stuff  and he's like  yeah I'm not supposed  to drink whatever  it does really bad things  and now the show's over  and we're all just  hanging partying  and stuff  and he's just pounding  man  just pounding  so the next day  we're at this awful  greasy joint  to get breakfast 
[02:17:00]  and I'm sitting with Jimmy  and I'm like  where's Sean  and he comes into  the restaurant  like he said  the guy can't even move  it was painful  to watch the guy  and he basically sits down  and even just sitting down  he's like  ugh  like even just sitting hurt  and then he's like  eating his food  but he can barely move  his arms  to get the food  in his mouth  because he's just  beating the shit  out of his body  well go ahead  oh so I tried driving home  from Atlantic City  with him yesterday  and his leg is all messed up  because it's swollen  his knee  so he keeps hitting it  to like get the circulation moving 
[02:17:30]  oh my god  there he is  he's a mess  he's limping around  our offices right now  as we speak  hitting that leg  to wake it up  but besides all that crap  man the stuff he does  on stage  I absolutely love this guy  love this guy  I don't know what kind  of radio he can do  oh he's funny  we've done Dallas together  we'll have him sit in  and we'll see what happens  so Sean Rouse is on  the program next  just remember  get into plain food  that's always a good one  Bob Kelly calling in  and Chris Jericho

[02:25:30]  they're bringing a ship in  to the harbor  here in New York City  the Norwegian Dawn  had a little problem  out there at sea  R at sea  ran into a storm  and then got hit  with a rogue wave  a 70 foot wave  hit this cruise ship  and broke windows  filled up like  67 cabins  got flooded  they were shown  home video  inside the ship  of blood on the walls 
[02:26:00]  where people were  banging off the walls  and they had other video  of people in life jackets  sitting in this big room  and the ship  is moving so much  they're sliding back  and forth on the floor  like really rough seas  so it got repaired  in South Carolina  I think  and now it's  working its way back  and just about  it should be docking now  but yeah  there it is on New York 1  they're showing a clip of it  coming into New York  slowly but surely  it's right by my house  well there you go  it's actually docking 
[02:26:30]  it's right next to the  Intrepid Air Space Museum  that is right  I can see that from my window  yeah you know what  and at noon  all the local news stations  are going to go live  perfect perfect opportunity  for an assault on the media  because they are going to be  chatting with all the people  they want to hear  all the details  of course they do  what was it like  of course  being on board  during  it would be cool  to be in the pool  during that  be like a wave pool  sloshing around in there  what was it during the day  or the night  when everybody was sleeping  I don't know  I don't know  well I'm sure  we'll get those details 
[02:27:00]  it's got to be creepy man  I just got back from a cruise  so uh  I mean  and we had  we had a great time  barely a wave  I could not imagine  being at sea  and having this thing  just being thrown around  like that  and it really does  give you that  that respect  for the sea  arr  because these things  are huge  when you're walking  around in them  you're in a friggin casino  you don't even know  you're on a ship  you're gambling  you got waitresses  bringing you drinks  and you don't even realize  that you know 
[02:27:30]  if the sea decides  to get a little angry  we're fucked out here  you don't think about it  you're at the pool  you're sunning  you're drinking  you're banana daiquiris  if you're a faggot  you're shuffleboarding  oh I don't think  anyone shuffleboards anymore  they put these shuffleboard things  like where you walk  oh okay  and they're just part of the deck  wasn't that a big thing  you've been on cruise ships  is shuffleboard  yeah back in the days  when they used to hit icebergs  and sink  killing everybody  I watched Love Boat  I thought everyone  was shuffleboarding  now you have 
[02:28:00]  as they were jogging  around the deck  in those jogging  cruise ship jogging suits  now they have a mini golf  they had that on the ship  play a little mini golf  and they have a rock wall  so you climb the rock wall  nice  yeah big rock wall  then they got numerous pools  for your pooling pleasure  plenty of things to drink  like I said casinos  and to just have this thing  thrown around  like this boat was 
[02:28:30]  makes it look like nothing  the ocean makes these things  they're nothing  it's a cigarette butt  in your toilet bowl  it really is  oh that's creepy  scary  that's creepy  when you think of it  very creepy  when you think of it that way  well we got some audio  from the cruise ship  some of the passengers  Anthony  oh  listen to this one  we have a dinner  and chandelier come down  panels come down  in the restaurant  people get up  and start running  through their rooms  because the wave  goes bigger  and bigger  and bigger  I have no idea  does anyone speak  that language  chandeliers came down 
[02:29:00]  chandeliers  was this guy on the cruise ship  or on one of those boats  from Cuba  what the hell was  this guy could afford a cruise  maybe he was just watching  the Poseidon adventure  oh that's it  yeah the chandelier came down  alright  they were playing  the Titanic song  on the piano  the theme song  to the Titanic  and that's exactly  how we all felt  we were on the Titanic  well  slow down  asshole  slow down  Jesus  yeah  slow down 
[02:29:30]  yeah just like being on the Titanic  yeah  oh you know  if we had to jump into that  70 degree water  exactly like the North Atlantic  where you're dead in two seconds  yeah just like  just like the Titanic  icebergs all around us  this song  I dedicate  to the brave people  of the Norwegian Dawn  who almost gave their lives  in search  of a banana daiquiri  and a few hands  of three card poker 
[02:30:00]  on that fateful night  when a wave  hit their boat  and jostled them slightly  I bet they were reminded  of the thousands  that died on board  the Titanic  people of the Norwegian Dawn  you are true  survivors  they were playing  the Titanic song  on the piano  the theme song  to the Titanic  and that's exactly  how we all felt  we were on the Titanic  hey  slow down buddy 
[02:30:30]  yeah  I don't think  Celine Dion's gonna be  singing a song  about you tools  a stopover  to repair the chandelier  in South Carolina  delaying you a day  and freezing to death  in the North Atlantic  yeah that is a lot  that is similar  well  I think they went  through all the band  band-aids  on the cruise ship  oh is that what  happened  well that is tragic  there was a band-aid  saw shortage  once  more  it was very scary 
[02:31:00]  here's another clip  from the cruise ship  it was the longest  night of my life  with three kids  in the cab  okay  we thought we ain't  gonna make it  god that's what  Guido Sarducci  is doing these days  we thought we  weren't gonna make it  we thought we  weren't gonna make it  hey  I looked out  at the waves  I said  mama mia  are there any 
[02:31:30]  Americans on this ship  or they all just  dumped guineas  who knows  another  something  another  whatever  another what  I was gonna say  another non-story  that will blow  out of proportion  oh it's a biggie  nah it was kind of  a biggie  I guess  if you were there  alright well  that's developing  so there's gonna be  a lot of news crews  down there  oh get down there  on the west side  get down there  we'll see what happens  assault on the media  this guy Herc  is going on the same 
[02:32:00]  ship at noon  is that true  Herc  yes  what's up Herc  real fast  cause we gotta get  to Dane Cook  my wife and I  are actually  waiting for the limo  we're going on  to check in  on the very same  ship  the guys told us  that the  hot tubs  blew right off  the deck  of the god damn  thing  really  yeah  it blew right  off into the ocean  see that's just  as bad as the  Titanic  see dude  as humans  we're great  with just  just hosing it  down and moving  on  move along  move along  you won't even  see the blood  smeared on the  walls  oh no  it's gonna look  like a brand new 
[02:32:30]  ship when you  board later on  today  don't even worry  about it  you know  it's a little  creepy about the  cruise ships  they have taken  on this whole  fascination with  the Titanic  there's a picture  taking session  in front of a  backdrop  that looks like  the grand  staircase of the  Titanic  that you can  stand there  and have  pictures taken  and it's like  wait you're on  a cruise ship  and they're  they have a  backdrop that you  can take a  picture of  from the  Titanic  that explains  on my  continental flight  recently where  they had the 
[02:33:00]  cut out of  Mohammed Atta  and you could  put your face  through  exactly  it's like  why  why would  you want  that you're  on a  cruise ship  you know  it's a little  I find the  whole Titanic  thing a little  strange  we've talked  about in the  past that  they have  that big  inflatable  Titanic  slide  that's at  the kid  parties  where the  deck went  up and a  kid can slide  down and have  fun and meanwhile  real people were  sliding down to  their deaths  on that deck  but I guess it  was long enough  ago where  enough time  went by  you ever do  that fun thing  where you get 
[02:33:30]  you and four  of your friends  and you all  put your  faces through  and have  your picture  taken in the  bathtub with  the Andrea  Yates picture  I usually  don't laugh  at those  but that's a  great one  that's a good  one man  that's good  you know I  was out in  Modesto  here we go  a nice  photo op  a little  rowboat  anchors away  exclamation  point  hey Dane  yo  Dane Cook  everyone  a very very  funny comedian  he's on tour  with Bob Kelly 
[02:34:00]  who else  there Dane  we got  let's see  Gary Goleman  and Jay Davis  on this tour  bus  coast to coast  right now  Bobby's actually  out of commission  but you know  last night  we were on this  bus and we  took a hard  left  I'm not just  saying this  I've got to be  honest  it was like  being on the  Titanic  yeah the bus  I got a little  jostled  it was just like  being on that  Metallica bus  back in the day  it really was  yeah  I felt like  Cliff Burton  back here  being thrown 
[02:34:30]  around  how did Bob  hurt himself  did he hurt  his back  bending over  and tying  his shoes  with a fat  stomach  we stepped  into this  camping area  and we were  just you know  going to have  a little food  maybe play a  little football  or something  and we decided  because we're  idiots  we decided  to play football  on a fucking  field where  it's not only  uneven  you know  terrain  but there's  like rock  it's like a  quarry  basically  so Bobby 
[02:35:00]  being fucking  you know  trying to be  a QB  when he doesn't  even know  how to hold  a ball  he's out there  he's running  around  and he's  being silly  and then  he goes  dude I'm  going to run  out  lateral it  back  you're going  to throw  it back  to me  and a couple  of the guys  on the crew  because we had  to do this  thing really  cheaply  we had to  pull in a  couple of  these guys  from the  Dominican  Republic  to handle  the camera  Bobby  goes up  with one  of these  fucking  giant  Dominicans  he gets  all tangled 
[02:35:30]  up  and he  comes down  and he  his knee  I'm telling  you  his knee  looked like  a flamingo  it went  completely  the wrong  way  what an  ass he is  playing  football  he was  screaming  I've known  Bobby  15 years  he was  screaming  his perfectly  trimmed  goatee  off  he's on  the ground  we're all  around him  we get him  to the  hospital  we'll know  today  because we  have to  bring him  to this  we're up  near Syracuse  now but 
[02:36:00]  we have to  bring him  to an  orthopedic  surgeon  but he  either  tore  his  MLC  or he  really  pulled it  but they  think he  may have  torn it  so what's  going to  happen  they're  going to  have to  put a  cast  on him  which is  going to  be good  because he's  trying to  lose weight  so I'm sure  that will  help you  sitting there  for six months  that's going to  work  what will  happen with  his thing  did they fix that  you have to be  in a cast  for a few  weeks  yeah he's  actually on the  bus up front  right now  sleeping  they got him  on some meds  he's in an  air cast 
[02:36:30]  and then  I don't know  exactly what the  next step is  we're going to  find out today  but they said  he should be  able to  perform  he just won't  be able to  move  he's going to  be on crutches  or something like that  it's going to be  hard to fuck a chair  while he's standing  on one leg  you know  Dane he was so  excited about this  tour  it's the tourgasm  right  yeah man  he was so  excited  yep  and now it's  going to  let's be honest  it's going to  suck for him  a little bit  well the good  thing is  I mean  we've got  the first  couple of  weeks have  been sick  I mean

[02:52:30]  when you're in today  for that pilot shoot  and i'm like  yes i will  and it was noon  and i realized  i had a four o'clock  shoot at carolines  so i'm panicking  i'm telling sean  we gotta fucking go  now  and trying to get him  to hustle  it was fucking  it was like getting  mr wiggins  no i mean  mr tugball  yeah that was it  tugball  mr tugball  the fucking  he's puttering around  the room  he's like i'm sorry dude  i look in  his fucking clothes  are all over the floor  i'm like oh  this is gonna be a problem  and you have no patience  i'm so cranky 
[02:53:00]  come on  come on dude  you have no patience  or sympathy  for someone in that position  because it's all about you  did you help sean  get his clothes together  i ran down to valet  and i'm pleased  just let this cocksucker  find the valet  and i'm down there  waiting for my car  i'm panicking  there's a bunch of  just baboons running around  and i finally realized  sean is not showing up  so i go and i grab him  and he's outside the hotel  in the wrong area  talking to a man  like he was asking for  i was looking  yeah i was looking  for the valet 
[02:53:30]  he can't speak fucking english  works there in the front  and uh  but hey we made it though  oh yeah we did  yeah you had a great time  huh  had a nice ride up  a lot of good laughs  yeah  i had people taking my picture  on uh  the garden state parkway  what  yeah  psycho fans  leaning out their car  and taking my  my picture  because my stupid car  has that big xm  satellite radio logo  yeah why'd you let them  slap that on there  you didn't even do it  did you  no  i think somebody came up  and said hey look  and like when we were  i don't even think 
[02:54:00]  we had signed yet  yeah no  and you didn't want to be a tool  because you want the job  and stuff  right  and they stick it on your car  so i'm driving back  like why are these people  recognizing me on a highway  that never happens  nope  duh  advertising right on the back bumper  and they're taking pictures  and stuff  it's the weirdest thing  yeah i missed that trip  bumming  they would elective gambled  a little bit  seen the boys  it was a great great time  jimmy killed  sean killed  yeah  even though that was a rough crowd  you still plowed through  fucking monkeys 
[02:54:30]  just beating the shit out of the crowd  i loved it  there you go  aren't they animals  they gave yoshi a hard time man  yoshi's a lot of fun  he wasn't ready  what's that  he wasn't ready  yeah he wasn't expecting that type of aggression  from the crowd  because yoshi i've watched man  he's pretty dirty  he talks about burying retarded kids alive  yoshi's a scumbag  people would love him  but i think it shook him just a little bit  because he wasn't ready for them to yell  they're animals  i mean sean's dealt with them  you know  to know where to tell  you know  and those guys  but yeah  yoshi's a lot funnier than they gave him credit for  wow he got hammered huh 
[02:55:00]  yeah  he was just the first guy out  which is brutal  he dealt with it nice for years  he ate it pretty good  yeah  he ate it pretty good  which is kind of fun too  oh yeah  he took the last time  he failed  he's like  i'm sorry man  i'm like for what  he did fine  he got a couple of nice  connor peterson i got an applause break  oh really  yeah of course  but i think people enjoy watching someone eat it too  so  oh yeah  he ate it  i mean let's be honest  i mean he had a few lines but he ate it  but and it set up sean nice  because sean knew what to expect  yeah  because it was the first time he worked in front of an o and a crowd 
[02:55:30]  which is a little different  yeah  just a little bit  i've worked with you before  but not in a venue that size  yeah we've done  sacramento  was pretty nuts  dallas  yeah  they're all hardcore fans  but it's comedy clubs  a much different vibe  uh-huh  than a theater  yeah  so  i was uh  i was doing some of that gambling with um  mr paisano there anthony  joey paisano  yeah  he gave me a whole bunch of money  joey gave you money  well it was  it was uh  you know we have season tickets together  for the islanders 
[02:56:00]  uh-huh  so this is finally my money  oh the money back  because the uh  so then i  nhl  i decided to sort of live it up in uh  in atlantic city  what'd you do  i only lost about  i don't know  i lost about four or five hundred  oh you dropped some  not much though  because i don't know  i don't have the gambling bug  no  joey paisano has the gambling bug  bad  you bag of shells  so he gives me my  you know  he basically gives me all 20s  i gave him a check for uh  you know the islander season tickets 
[02:56:30]  uh-huh  and he finally gives me my money back in  in cash  of course it's cash  all 20s in an envelope  and i  don't he doesn't write checks  i have a feeling he has about a hundred  to a  to a thousand of these envelopes  in his house  i don't need checks  how's that paper trail  so uh  he hands me my cash  he's got his  i've never seen a bigger bankroll  on on a human being  than what joey  yeah  in atlantic city  but i guess it turns out  he uh  he goes and does some of that gambling  three or four times a year  and he goes all out  and  yeah  he's not a pussy like me 
[02:57:00]  so he's like  let's uh  let's start with some three card poker  i'm like all right  so we sit down  fun game  i love three card poker  because you don't really have to do anything  well you got to decide if you're going to play  if uh  the dealer uh  uh qualifies  you know  yeah  sit there and decide  eh  you know you got a queen too  or something like that  yeah  you throw it down  hey joey  yo  there he is  what's up buddy  what's up guys  you barely said goodbye yesterday morning  yeah  i took a little  little bit of a beating yesterday morning  upset yeah 
[02:57:30]  you left a little uh  and in kind of a bad mood  well  yeah  it started off real good  you know  jimmy's show was awesome  but uh  that next morning  that was a killer  well we start with three card poker  and i  i think i'm being a big spender anthony  i throw  a hundred dollars down  a hundred  and get some chips  and uh  joey just shows me up immediately  and  and he  he throws down five hundred  gotta start with five  he's throwing five hundred down  i  i've never played three card poker before  i  i've never really done a lot of this gambling 
[02:58:00]  before anthony  before we hit the vegas believe it or not  yeah  it just wasn't my thing  so  i sat down with joey  and  and i won the first ten hands in a row  that should have been joey's  oh really  but that's okay  oh  well it's the beginner's luck thing  it was  i've never seen a beginner sit down a three card poker and not win  it just doesn't happen  i turned my hundred into a quick 350  and then proceeded to lose it all  because i don't know  what were you getting like pairs or were you getting some good hands  i got a little of everything right joey  got a straight 
[02:58:30]  he was getting flushes  yeah  yeah  i mean like the first ten or twelve hands  he hit on it  did you have money up in that uh  pair plus thing  oh yeah  were you making money  yeah yeah yeah  yeah  right down  all the way down  yeah  good deal  so  well joey was showing me how to play  and i was winning every hand  and joey was losing every hand really fast  i watch him lose a thousand bucks within the first 15 minutes  20 minutes  it happens  right joey  what did you say  right  yeah oh yeah  but joey's betting big  every hand  yeah i was betting uh  i was betting i guess the minimum but it would be like thirty dollars a hand 
[02:59:00]  yeah  no big deal  oh no there would be 45 if you're in  uh-huh  so it was like 45-50 dollars a hand  but joey was joey was like a hundred a hand  he's no a hundred and uh twenty  how much joey like a hundred  really it was two hundred a hand  it would be three hundred every time  you know if you go to open  you know if you put that line  yeah yeah  yeah he's just rocking  so you're putting  yeah you're putting a hundred up  a hundred on the  a hundred on the  a hundred on the  a hundred on the ante  and then a hundred on the play  ooh  i just like the social thing  just hanging out  you're talking  and it's just fun 
[02:59:30]  you know whatever  and then my three  i like that too  as long as i'm winning  well my three fifty  so i turn the hundred into three fifty  and i lose all of it  like yeah whatever  i'm a smiling socializing motherfucker  when i'm winning  when i'm losing  i'm a miserable bastard  well  that was me yesterday morning  for that three and a half hour  ride home in traffic  oh great  i was gonna tell you  that's exactly what joey was  yeah  so then uh  he loses a quick thou  and then he's uh  he proceeds to start walking  toward the slot machines  with his lovely wife  and i go  no one wins at slot machines 
[03:00:00]  hate the slot machines  i'm getting all pissed off  no one  joey  and i'm about to admit something  in a second here  first of all  his uh  his wife won about  thirteen hundred on the  slots nine hundred and four hundred  right joey  in about  how long did that take her  five ten minutes  right  they have a whole strategy  get out  but i think everyone that goes to  atlantic city or vegas  they all go there with their strategy  that someone told them  like look  i hate the slots  so do i  i never have won on the slots  so stupid me  because i'm not 
[03:00:30]  one of these uh  gambling casino guys  right  joey sits down at a slot machine  and i see twenty five anthony  i see twenty five  i'm like  why is he bothering to play  twenty five cent slots  yeah  that's what i'm thinking  in my head  until i realize  after i don't know  ten or  about ten pulls there  he's playing twenty five dollar slots  and he's playing fifty dollars  a pull  you've got to cover both things  right  joey how much did you throw  on the machine to begin  like a thousand dollars  yeah  even five hundred  a thousand  i can't remember  yeah so he throws in  let's say five hundred 
[03:01:00]  okay  and he's doing fifty dollars  you know  a push  fifty dollars a push  i'm thinking it's fifty cents  i'm like whoa  hey big spender here  it was fifty dollars  fifty dollars  i had no idea  so then you lost about  eight hundred  on the slot machines  just like that  so now he's already down  eighteen hundred dollars  we've barely been in the casino  maybe an hour  and then  then all of a sudden  you moved to the next machine  right at that point  yeah  i pulled the money out of that machine  oh no  i won back a thousand  i think quickly 
[03:01:30]  i won back a thousand  after i dropped it  i won it back  and then i pulled the money out  and went to the machine next to it  and you're like  what are you doing  you won your thousand  back  and that's exactly  that's what exactly  exactly what i'm thinking  i'm like  now  you just won a thousand  that's right  okay  so you just won a thousand  i'm thinking in my stupid head  trying to cash out  and you know  this is me  and that's why i'm not  you know a gambler i guess  that would be it for the weekend  for an hour  i'm like what do you want me to do  go up to the room  yeah what are you going to do  that's the problem  you're there  right  now you gotta  you can't win early 
[03:02:00]  and then go home  but i would find something else  to do at that point  it's just me  no there's nothing else to do  no i understand  you're there to gamble  i saw it in joey's eyes  i understand the addiction now  so he's up a thousand  on that machine  i'm like thinking  okay he's gonna cash out  we'll go do dinner  or drinks or something  and he hits the next machine  yeah  and all of a sudden  you lost a quick 500 there joey  right  yeah  so he's up a thousand  now he's only up 500  then he hits for 2500  2500  hits for 2500  nice  the bells  the whistles  the lights  the security guard 
[03:02:30]  comes over with the lady  fill out this  fill out that  and counts the money  right in front of joey  joey big spender  just tipping her like crazy  for the win  you know  yeah  so now i'm thinking  he just hit for 2500  on this other machine  for  for uh  a total gain of two thousand dollars  he's up two thousand dollars  on that machine  right  right  i'm thinking  okay now  obviously  he's gonna walk away  because now he's up some good coin  right  he's no walking away  he moves to the third machine  and proceeds to lose  eight hundred dollars  in less than three minutes 
[03:03:00]  three minutes huh  tops  maybe less  right joe  yeah  that's why you're there  that's why you're there  right  it's never enough  but then  that's when  uh  i  i have a feeling  you and your wife  have some kind of agreement  because then at that point  i think your wife  like kind of studies your eyes  because she  she steps in  and goes  that's it  uh oh  and cashes out  like  like she knows  to leave joey alone  to a point  like they  i think they talk about this  back at home  like look 
[03:03:30]  you know  this is my thing  i do it  i come down  with this much money  i'm gonna lose this much money  or win money  whatever  but if it gets to this point  that's when i want you to step in  i'm gonna pull you out  because i can't control myself  i have that feeling  because all of a sudden  she just  stepped in  and took over  and the whole time  she was just kind of  in the background  playing her little  two dollar slots  and stuff  you know  without it  i'm doomed  i'm just doomed  because usually  it's you know  i tell her look  if it gets to the credit cards  you must  pull me away  oh yeah 
[03:04:00]  yeah  that's when you say  that's it  you're going home  by yourself  yeah exactly  so then we fast forward  we have a nice steak dinner  then we go see  we see jim norton  and sean rouse  and yoshi  and everything is good  and then we go into some  disco  and into a private room  and we're drinking  like  feeling like  you know  rap stars  or something man  it was pretty cool  is that what we're doing  i think it was watching sean  almost sexually assault  everybody in the room  holy shit  yeah i knew i wasn't 
[03:04:30]  going to fuck that one girl  so i just started pushing her  sean is very scary  when he gets drunk  she's lucky she didn't get bit  hey joey how funny was sean man  you were saying it  he was awesome  he was great  joey you're an angel  i didn't put joey on the spot  he was ranting and raving  about you after the show  no blackjack guys  you didn't sit down  at the blackjack table  no then  then we have breakfast  the next morning  and joey's like  i'm going to three card  i'm going back to three card poker 
[03:05:00]  i'm like i gotta check on a couple things  i actually had to hit the bathroom  and take care of business  do you win  uh no here  i couldn't get out  i mean in the bathroom  oh yeah yeah  of course i did  pull that handle  that flesh handle  that's a surprise  so i'm only  two logs and some blood  i'm only five minutes behind joe  i'm only five minutes behind joe  i go to his table  and this is the morning  it's like 10 11 a.m  people get in their last minute gambling  because you gotta check out  of your room at 11  i thought it would be a piece of cake to sit down  the table  the tables would be free  but they were packed 
[03:05:30]  so i couldn't sit next to joe  but so i'm sitting  you know behind  or standing behind him  and just kind of supporting whatever  and i wasn't the cooler by the way  because you were  you were sucking before i got there  i was  i can't blame you for that one  i definitely  dude  aw  you lost how many hands in a row  at three card poker  all right and picture this  and this is not joking  i saw it for myself  18 hands in a row  get out of here  with the highest thing i got  was a king  18 hands in a row 
[03:06:00]  18 hands in a row  i've never ever ever  seen anything like it  i saw the last maybe  10 hands  that's a run of bad luck man  and i'm not even lying  so the last 10 hands  did not see one picture card  wow  i saw  and then he's doubling up  because now he's in the whole deep  so he's  yep  you were like  you were betting  250 a hand  easily 300 a hand  easily  yeah i was going nuts  and i'm behind him going  i'm behind him like  oh my god  and he's slowly looking at his cards  it was like a 4 
[03:06:30]  a 7  and a 2  oh  it was just  one bad hand after another  where everyone  at the table  they wouldn't even look at him anymore  because they knew he was betting heavy  and losing his ass  was everyone else at the table doing well  believe it  just about everyone at the table  was doing really well  some guy at the end was playing 2  he had 2 spots  yeah  and he's getting straight  and flushes  and pairs  on everything  don't you hate that  it's like  why can't one of these  get over here to me  right  and that's all i said  i was like  you know  just give me one pass  so i can walk away 
[03:07:00]  and say  alright at least i won one  yeah  dude and the hundreds  i mean i saw it in his eyes  he just couldn't believe it  so the hundreds  are just coming out  well you know what happens  after you lose a few  you think i am so due  so now i gotta make my  i gotta make my big bet now  yeah  the hundreds were coming out  you have to think it's coming  it's just gotta come  and if i lose that one  i gotta make a bigger bet  because it's dumb due  yep  so then he finally  that's it  he's done  his wife once again  that was it  stepped in  the wife has to step in  and i'm not calling  joey a pussy  trust me 
[03:07:30]  it's it's it's a thing  they have set up somewhere  where it gets to a point  that's when she's allowed to  why are you calling  joey a pussy  joey there's five replays  of this show  you you just make sure  what i said  okay  alrighty  and uh  you know  and then i guess  no actually  at this point  joey knew it was a lost cause  and he steps up  and there's a guy waiting  to sit in joey's seat  yeah  and i'm like  hey let's see if uh  let's see  you gotta sit  and see how he does  but joey's smart  he's like dude  get me out of here  immediately  did not want to see this guy  get that nice hand 
[03:08:00]  and i guarantee he would've  oh if he would've gotten  a good hand  yeah so  so then he goes right  to the slot machines  how much did you throw  in the slot machines  i dumped brosley another  before we left  probably $0,000  dude no job  i couldn't  i was just living  i was twitching  i'm like  i like  there's nothing worse  than that car ride home  yeah you gotta win  all that money  and it's long  and drawn out  and it's long enough  as it is  but it really  gives you plenty of time  to think about it  so then he's at the slot machine 
[03:08:30]  cause you know  i thought he was staying  a little later  this was the final  the final uh  go at it  he's sitting at the slot machine  completely slumped  like this  i know it's radio  but just slumped over  and just going like this  just slapping the button  oh just disgusted  now it's work  now it's a job  yep  like a machine  oh  that was it  and watched him  i didn't know what it was  watch him go through  another thousand  see what people don't understand  it's another thousand  or you lose the money 
[03:09:00]  and stuff  but that  it's just as bad  leaving down 500  as it is leaving a thousand  it's just as bad  leaving down  1,000  as it is 5,000  you're leaving a loser  you've lost  that's why you keep playing  because you're trying to win  so you can leave a winner  absolutely  that's it  that's why you keep  dumping your money in  make that ride  a little bit better  and it just got worse  because there was  traffic everywhere  it took me  a 2 hour  20 minute ride  took 4 hours 
[03:09:30]  oh man  oh man  and then I go to Joey  as they're leaving  and they're heading  toward the garage  and I'm like  well at least you're up  for the weekend  he looks at me  with this look like  dude  you have no idea  Joey  ballpark  where would you say  you dropped  uh  well my wife  is definitely not listening  so probably around  4,000  4,500  oh yeah  but at one point  he was up close to 3  yeah but what are you  going to do  you want to be up 3  right when they go 
[03:10:00]  it's time to leave  right uh  your hotel's at your  checkout time  it's time to go  that's when you want  to be up  you can't be up  an hour after you  get to Atlantic City  you don't want to be up  you want to be down  an hour after you  get there  exactly  and then you want  to be up when you  leave  when you first hit  in the beginning  it's almost like  you're doomed  you just know  that is gone  right  yeah  and then the next  morning at breakfast  we sit down  and like the bill  comes  I'm like I don't  worry about it  you know I got my  card  it's gone  how does that work 
[03:10:30]  I'm like well you  know you play  and you know  they give you free  food and shit  like that  and he's like  oh that's great  you play and they  give you free food  I'm like believe me  I'd rather pay  yeah  that ain't free  now that I'm losing  to get the free  break  Joey's got the red  card but then he  was explaining  they have these  black cards  how much do you  have to lose  to get a black  card or how  much do you  have to play  like a hundred  grand to get  a black card  yeah  so  it's just how  much money  is going back  and forth  hey Joey 
[03:11:00]  at least you got  the Yankees  to look forward to  so  you guys are doing  just great this year  that's how to make up  your losses  just bet against  the Yankees  yeah Yankees  are in great shape  George Steinbrenner  is already yelling  and screaming  George is cracking  the whip  the Yankees  the last place  Yankees  I believe  last place Yankees  I hope they win  five games  this whole fucking year  wasting all that money  on Alex Rodriguez  and Randy Johnson  and Kevin Brown  Cashman and Steinbrenner  should be shot  there is no reason  for these shitty acquisitions 
[03:11:30]  stop it  with the 50 year old  pitchers  fucking young talent  in the farm system  you had it  and you got greedy  stupid  and that's what you get  good  I hope they lose  every game  and fucking  David Ortiz  kills him again  wow  maybe if you pick up  some middle relief  Rivera wouldn't have  to start in the sixth inning  could fucking  Torrey stop that  because the bullpen  eats ass  let's go Mets  let's go Mets  Mets looked pretty good  they were on a little  streak there  they had a better  off season  and now it's  now they're 
[03:12:00]  you know  they're proving that  alright Joey  I think this is a great  week to go see  Joey at Paisano's  on Wilbur Street  in the heart of  Little Italy  buy a lot of food  when you're there  please  buy it all  Joey's hurting a little bit  so just buy an extra  appetizer if you're down there  that's it  a little bit  a little bit goes a long way  Joey you still got that  fried ravioli right  oh absolutely  oh that is the best  get like five of those  for your table  there you go people  you gotta go down there  now the food is great  beautiful  hey our own little Eric  can I say why you're

[03:14:00]  one of the stockholders  from Sirius  killing himself  after they announced  the fucking  Martha Stewart deal  irrelevant idiots  I guess that's a big  announcement that the  little doggy company  is going to make today  and  and XM passed on  Martha Stewart  because you know  she's got a lot of  juice right now  six months from now  no one's going to care  and she wanted way  too much fucking money  she's a boring  aging twat  nobody cares about it  that's what they do  that's what they do over there  they pay through the nose  another stupid deal  for the little doggy company  have fun with that one  that's not  see this is a gun 
[03:14:30]  that's a gunfire  this isn't a gun  that sounds  that sounds like rain  in a thunderclap  no no it's an echo  oh okay  an echo is why  see which one sounds  which one sounds  more realistic  Eric  that one  or this one  that one  oh wow  really  yeah  our own Eric is  very famous by the way  when can we talk about it 
[03:15:00]  Wednesday  Wednesday  Wednesday  Wednesday we can talk about it  alright  alright  let them speculate  dun dun dun dun dun  Jesus  what a  what a giveaway guy  you are  what are you talking about  what the hell are you talking about  subtle as a kick in the balls  we got a break  Joey thank you so much  hey thanks guys  and Sean  Jimmy guys rock Saturday night  it was awesome  thank you  yeah we had a lot of fun

[03:16:00]  Professor Jim Norton  I'm a perv  and I'm weird  but I'm straightforward  Professor Norton outlines  his very hands-on approach  to sexual education  wait till your kids are sleeping  just lay over one of them  they won't know  oh Jesus  what  for example  the art of foreplay  the first thing I do  the first thing I do  is go to the bathroom  and take one of those  eight decibel shits  oral sex  sexual experimentation  I was performing  tushalinga  and sexually transmitted diseases  I wish I had AIDS  so I could bite somebody  and for the grown-ups  there's also a segment  on marriage counseling  honey you're 41 
[03:16:30]  can I finally have  the balloon nut  he'll also stress  the importance of lubrication  you want it to sound like  when your muddy boot  gets stuck  like a quagmire  another word to the wise  from Professor Jim Norton  remember  on the fake  Ian Anthony  XM 202  ah we're back 
[03:17:00]  with the O.P. and Anthony program  that's Fozzy enemy bro  Chris Jericho in studio  we talked to Chris Jericho  on the phone about that song  I love it  I wasn't expecting much  I think I told you  on the phone  because you were doing  kind of a cover band  type of thing  at first for the band  so my buddy  Eddie from Big Brother  the one-legged dude  yeah that's right  he actually  forgot about that  he's the actor  in the enemy video 
[03:17:30]  and he was the one  who sent it to me  I'm like  alright well  Eddie's a friend of mine  and we've had Chris  on the show a bunch  and my expectations  were low  I'm not going to lie  that's not a cut down  and then I saw the video  and heard the song  and I was instantly a fan  and blown away by both  blown away  that's very good  people are pleasantly surprised  when they hear it  all across the board  which is good  I mean that's  that's kind of cool  because people  like you said  they think  well this can't be any good  because it's a wrestler singing  but I mean what difference  does it make  if it's a wrestler 
[03:18:00]  or a florist  or a psychiatrist  it's either good music  or it's bad  and people are digging it  so that's cool for us  I think because wrestlers  don't have that record  behind them  of good records  you look at maybe  the Hulkster  I remember the Hulkster  playing a couple  so in the line  of wrestlers  becoming musicians  you're pretty much  an original  Anthony I got it  stop you got the Hulk Hogan  there  you got the Hulk record  there  I got to hear some of that  I got the Hulk Hogan record  is that where he sings  gospel music  this is the one  it's called Hulk Hogan  and the Wrestling Boot Band 
[03:18:30]  it's Hulk rules  wow  see there you go  that's my competition  right there  yeah there it is  yeah that's the automatic  you think of  now give us a track  off there  gotta hear it  well which one  did you like  there's so many  to choose from  I like the rockin'  American one  it's very patriotic  we found the other two  that you liked  I Want to Be a Hulkamaniac  and Hulkster in Heaven  remember that one  yeah yeah  that's the gospel one  that's the touching one  yeah that's right  which one do you want to hear  let's hear the rockin' one  first and then we'll hear  the ballad 
[03:19:00]  well Eric  Eric is like a Hulkster geek  which one is the rockin' one  I don't think any of them  are all rockin'  I think that's kind of  an oxymoron  yeah this isn't like  there might be an up-tempo song  but rockin' would  isn't there  the one you mentioned  the Hulkster in Heaven  or I Want to Be a Hulkamaniac  I Want to Be a Hulkamaniac  I Want to Be a Hulkamaniac  that's gotta be the one  we are not comparing this  to what Chris Jericho  is doing musically  by the way  please don't  come on  oh my gosh  this kicked ass 
[03:19:30]  Rick Astley  watch out  oh that's great  I Want to Be a Hulkamaniac  have fun with my family and friends  have fun with my family and friends  yeah  I Want to Be a Hulkamaniac  have fun with my family and friends  all right  oh my gosh  if you want to be a Hulkamaniac  he's rapping  I'm not sure how you have to stay on  you got to train  to see your prayers  eat your vitamins too  these are all the things  that the maniacs do  pasta box and pasta beads 
[03:20:00]  these are the things  that make us succeed  always be good to your family and friends  who the fuck enjoys this  nobody  how famous are you  when people around you  say oh this is good  yeah exactly  this is a great idea  people actually greenlit that  and said this is good  this is great  but then again people greenlit  William Hung as well  it's the same shit right  we have one that beats all of them  the Joe Pesci record  wow  right  he's not really singing is he  oh my god  rapping  more rapping  why  people decided that they had to rap 
[03:20:30]  because that's what the kids are listening to  that's what the kids want  the kids want the rap star  but of all the stars  it's like Joe Pesci  he's our man  why Joe  of all the guys you can choose  what kind of street cred does Joe have  no we can do  none  we can play bitches that'll get you  on just the bed  bitches gonna get you  it's the bitches that'll get you  that's Joe Pesci  that's Joe Pesci  I don't believe  they should have a sample of him saying  they fuck you in the drive-thru  they fuck fuck fuck fuck you in the drive-thru  wait wait wait  I wanna be a Hulk 
[03:21:00]  Jericho does the show on  fun with my family and friends  we got a little harmony there too  that was wonderful  here's the follow-up by the way  talk about bringing the show to a screechy Hulk  here's the follow-up  oh this is a nice one  wasn't the kid a Hulk  that kid was a big Hulk fan  he died  you heard this before  oh my god yeah  Hulkster in heaven  oh my god  I saw it on TV  I guess it'll be one empty seat  when I wrestle at Wimblede 
[03:21:30]  Wimblede  wait a minute  hold on  that could be the worst rhyme  I've ever heard  I've thrown a flag  he made Wembley  into a four world  four syllable word  Wembley  Wembley  and it's a lie  because his father  would probably just  scalp the ticket outside  somebody will sit there  Wembley  Wembley  I went back  I guess it'll be one empty seat  when I wrestle at Wimblede  that is awful 
[03:22:00]  I've never heard of this  in existence before  this is the first time  I've ever heard this record  fantastic  and I guarantee  it's the last  the last  I used to tear my shirt  but now you tore my heart  I knew you were a Hulkster maniac  right from the very start  right from the start  oh my god  the gospel singers in the background  bring in the girls  yeah  wow  I would like to see a sound scan  on how many records that sold  yeah  how many returns there was as well 
[03:22:30]  you were my friend  you could know the kick  yeah  I'll see you again  just trying to get to the heart  Hulkster comes to heaven  heaven  heaven  heaven  we'll tag up again  we'll tag up again  we'll just fall  alright  enough for that  wow  we'll tag up again 
[03:23:00]  we should have some celebrity skeet shooting  and use that as the first target  for sure  he's gonna wrestle once again  with a five year old  with Hodgkins  that's really attractive  we'll wrestle again  again  again  oh is that horrid  I'm in shock at this point in time  I think we all are  ladies and gentlemen  this is what you paid your hard-earned money for  to get XM Radio  to hear us play Hulkster songs  play Hulkster songs  this is it  someone's enjoying it  that's right  it's Hulkster Monday brother  let's go to Tim in Tennessee  Tim 
[03:23:30]  Macho Man Randy Savage  put out some of the best  wrestling rap ever recorded  Macho Man has some  you've never heard that  what do we have that  are you kidding me  of course  I wouldn't have  I am not kidding you  you are a man amongst men there Chris  I gotta tell you  because  this  the track record  of wrestlers making music  all alone  I'm about to play our song  because now it's just getting lumped into  like this horrible  I'm gonna defend Chris Jericho  I didn't say anything bad about him  no he didn't 
[03:24:00]  no he hasn't  I'm just saying like  if you're listening at home  and you heard what we just heard  it's just spiraling out of control  he's not  he's not  putting out his music  as Chris Jericho  what  he's part of Fozzy  well there you go  he's separating the two Anthony  that's the key  that's the secret  that is the secret  I don't want to give it away  but that is the secret  that's the secret to it all  this is not Fozzy  this is so hard 
[03:24:30]  he's a joke  we're avoiding rainy seven  cause you know you can smoke  come on  that pony fight  the rocks  ain't too fast  for what I tell his homie  do a real fight  he passed  I called him out  but the punk was here to go  it was a charity event  but the Hulk didn't show 
[03:25:00]  Hollywood Hulk stuff  you're at the end of your rope  and I'm a kickin' the fuck  wash your mouth  I was so  cause  like Rodney Dangerfield  you get so respect  so come on  Hulk is wreck  so I can put you in chat  be a man Hulk  come on  don't be sad  terrible  that is really bad  be a man Hulk  be a man Hulk  here's the secret  if you're gonna do  like if you're a wrestling guy  and you want to make a record  don't sing about wrestling  or rap about wrestling  he's rapping about wrestling  it's terrible  that is fucking terrible 
[03:25:30]  I'm gonna be the first  you fuck with me  you'll stick a Slim Jim up your ass  oh yeah  I never heard that either  I'm out of the loop  of the wrestling albums guys  thank god  it didn't influence you  you know if you heard this beforehand  you might have gone that  a whole rap direction  another direction  alright we got Swiggy checking in  Swiggy  hey guys what's going on  hanging out with Chris Jericho  hey Chris I gotta ask you something  I know you can't give a true answer to this  but I want to turn the topic  of conversation back to wrestling 
[03:26:00]  what the hell is the deal with Triple H  I mean come on  you got a new champion  and Batista  and Triple H is all over  saying how wonderful he is  booking 101 says that's not how you promote  a new champion  I mean it's ridiculous  well I know you're unhappy there  and you talked about not renewing a contract  but god  who said that  it's just so  how do you know that he's unhappy  yeah  have we bugs from another life  you gave an interview  I read an interview  where you were saying  that's a bullshit interview 
[03:26:30]  in an interview  I heard the fact  you ain't renewing your contract  listen  listen  when I was in Wimbled Alley  this year  I thought about it  no I don't know what happened  in that interview  I don't think I even really did that one  yeah  being unhappy  I mean  what can you be unhappy about  you're working  doing your dream job  and having a great life  because of it  I mean  things never go 100%  the way you want it to go  but I mean  that's work  and I mean  Triple H is  I mean  he's the star of the show  on our show 
[03:27:00]  and that's how he's  promoted at  and that's how he's pushed  and that's kind of the guy  that they're going with  similar to  Hulk Hogan was  you know 10 years ago  maybe someday Triple H  will have his own record  Triple H and Triple Heaven  I'm not sure  so politically correct  anyway  let's not be politically correct  I'm just telling you  I mean that's just the way it is  you either like it  or you don't like it  or whatever  but you have to deal with it  because that's the guy  who's got the gig right now  just like in any job you have  somebody will get the promotion  someone will get the  you know  be the senior vice president  are they the best man for the job 
[03:27:30]  I guess we'll find out and see  but that's kind of the way  that the world works  Booking 101 says  when you have a new champion  all eyes  the focus of the show  should be around him  not the ex-champion  trying to get his belt back  but they've been doing that  for the last five years  ever since I was a champion  it was like that  when Ben was a champion  it was like that  exactly  that's the whole promotion  that's why the ratings  not saying it's the right way  to do things  I'm saying that's the way it is  either you accept it  or you just quit  you know what I mean  that's kind of how you have  to deal with it  or you just go work  at McDonald's  or something I guess 
[03:28:00]  hey guys real quickly  I want to be a Hulkamaniac  the bugs are going to get us  how'd that song go  by the retarded kids  oh you better watch out  or the insects will get you  yeah  it almost sounded like that  didn't it  yeah thanks guys  thanks man  is that a real song  yeah there's a song  you've never heard  the insect song  no  it was done by the  what were these  what was the school name  the kids  yeah here it is  kids of Wheatley High  or something like that  listen to this  and it's a bunch of  mentally challenged children  retards  they put together 
[03:28:30]  an album  OP  mentally challenged  or retards  and it sounds better  than the Hulksters  you better watch out  are the insects against you  oh my god  go ahead  poor kids  you better watch out  are the insects against you  oh this isn't that album  I thought it was a retarded  this is actually from  the first ten rows  of the wrestling  at the garden  the other night  but what do they tell 
[03:29:00]  of these poor kids  that the insects  are going to get them  and eat them alive  isn't that kind of creepy  I know  they make this song  it's like  what influence  it's like Catholic school  be good or I'll throw  some bugs in your bed  right and they will kill you  son of a bitch  yeah  well why are we playing this  when there's other  there's better music  we can be listening to  so you're going to be  re-signing with the  WWE there Chris  well my contract is up  in about eight months  and if you ask me today  I'd say absolutely not  we just got back 
[03:29:30]  from Australia on Sunday  if you can hear the  hear the funk in my voice  I'm dead sick  I was home for six days  and now we've got to go  back to England  for another two weeks  we're going to wing  on over to London  and jam with the stones  yeah  my dad's a TV repairman  he's got an awesome  set of tools  that's what I'm doing  winging on over there  and actually we're jamming  with Fozzy in Germany  we have a German tour  but we've got to go  to Scotland and England  and Germany  before that with the WWE  so the wheel never ends  I'm the hamster on the wheel  going from a little pellet  of grain  and it just goes 
[03:30:00]  and goes and goes  so sometimes it kind of  gets to you in that respect  you know  you book the gigs  that coincide with  where you're going to be  with the wrestling  sometimes  but this German tour  came up  before we even  actually had this tour  so I was able to  kind of piggyback it  together  but a lot of times  we do shows  after a wrestling show  we have a show  in New York  coming up on July 11th  at B.B. King's  right after the Raw show  at the Garden  so we do that quite a bit  we play a Fozzy show  after the Raw show  was done  so kind of connected  to there  so he said he's not  going to resign  if asked today  see what's going to 
[03:30:30]  happen is now  on the internet  it's like Jericho says  I know  I heard it man  and all the people  at B.B. Office  will read it  and go hey  Jericho's not resign  all these guys  get their exclusive  interview  their exclusive info  from the internet  that's right  wrestling is one of  those things  that's just huge  with rumors being  spread on the internet  always just so bad  it's amazing  it's probably one  of the worst industries  and a lot of these  people that do it  are like literally  14 and 15 year old kids  they're controlling  everything  yeah  and the kids  are controlling the world  and the guys  read it 
[03:31:00]  and believe it  you know  some guys  don't know  if they've had  a good match  or not  until they read  the internet  to tell them  oh you guys  aren't reading  those things  and going  oh mother  yeah fuck  I suck this week  oh man  you know  a lot of guys  do that  they read the internet  to see  we read every day  we have this  called instant feedback  and people are able  to put in comments  responses  to what we're saying  critiques of the show  funny lines  things like that  and on any given day  you could read  like right next to each other  you guys rule  just start listening  to the show  you're the funniest thing 
[03:31:30]  I've ever heard  on the radio  the next post down  why are you wasting my time  which is shit  you guys suck  so to actually take  any of it seriously  instead of just do  what you do  on a daily basis  and enjoy yourself  the most you can  to read that  and take it to heart  and take it to heart  holy shit  and that's the thing  jump off a building  well totally  as a professional  you know whether  you've had a good show  right  inside  so we don't need  people to tell us  we already know  it's nice to hear  if it was good  but I mean  you know  you could get  like some guys  that was a great show  and then you know  it's stuck on ice 
[03:32:00]  it's the same thing  with my radio show  that I have  on XM  on Da Boneyard  on Da Boneyard  I'll get  like you know  play some different tunes  some more obscure stuff  and a lot of people  like this is great  you play stuff  that we never heard  or we haven't heard  in a long time  and other people  will be like  I hate all this shit  what are you doing  you know play  you know  pour some sugar on me  or something stupid  like that  pull your finger  out of your ass  and start playing  shut the fuck up  I'll do what I do  that's why I got the gig  in the first place  that's why you guys  are here  that's why you get  to a certain position  you don't need someone  to tell you  if it's good or bad  or not  so anyways  how am I doing  on this show so far  and that's Sundays 
[03:32:30]  at 8pm  Sundays at 8pm  on Da Boneyard  what channel  are we on right now  202  ok  we're hidden  when you turn on  your X  I noticed this  over the weekend  they have added  so many channels  for the Major League  Baseball thing  when you first  power up your unit  it takes a while  for it to get  202 into the system  are you kidding  really  are we buried  what's around us  we're like the  easter egg  I think there's  like  easter egg station  I think it goes  202 and then goes  205 Playboy right  and then all the  traffic channels 
[03:33:00]  traffic  because people are  just listening to  those channels  like crazy  what's the Playboy  channel  that's the last  premium channel  they have  but what is it  though  like chicks  talking and stuff  yeah it's cool  for about 5 minutes  yeah who wants  to hear them talk  when you can't  see them right  yeah  it's like phone sex  I mean you know  for a goof  you tune in  every once in a while  and a girl's  telling some dirty  story  it'd be like  being blind  and watching porno  oh ok  pretty much the same  thing  a blind guy  watching porno  I mean while  it's some fat chick  from Hoboken  like she's like  45 years old  with three kids 
[03:33:30]  on each teat  that's right  exactly  those phone sex  things that were  exposed like  on Maury or  something  and we have our  phone sex operators  here today  and there are all  these pigs  talking about how  they get these guys  off with their voice  you know what I was  watching the day  we just had  Wrestlemania  and Roddy Piper  was on  they were showing  a bunch of  classic Roddy Piper clips  and Morton Downey Jr  on the podcast  do you remember that guy  do you remember how much  controversy he caused  when he first came out  like he was like  the biggest asshole  how silly does it look now  now it's like so funny  right  at the time he had that  cigarette and he'd blow 
[03:34:00]  smoke in their face  listen buster  he's like someone's  angry dad  that's right  just yelling all crotchety  and grumpy  anytime anyone's  having any fun  he's there to  knock it off  stop it  turn that down  God got him back though  because he was blowing  that smoke in everyone's face  to make his point  and he dies of  lung cancer  lung cancer right  got the lung cancer  there you go  the lung cancer  anti-smoking thing  before he died  like you know  I was wrong  oh yeah  well they told him  oh really  he went back  on his smoking past  wow  well after the doctor  tells you you have  lung cancer 
[03:34:30]  I think you start  doing that  I better start being good  yeah that's right  the best anti-smoking  ever was  Yul Brenner  Yul Brenner  talking about how  he's dead now  oh he did it  before he died  yeah he taped it  before he died  the creepiest thing  all of a sudden  he's like I'm dead now  like this emaciated  Yul Brenner  and then tells you  the reason why  he's now dead  wow  even though he was  still alive  that's pretty heavy  I'm surprised they  showed that  well it was  before everything  got so PC  yeah you could get  away with that  like in the late  70s early 80s  but now you've  never allowed that  I don't know  because it's anti-smoking 
[03:35:00]  they might  anything that kind of  goes hand in hand  with their own thinking  they'll allow you to do  and if it's anti-smoking  they'd probably  it's got to be  no no  because you know  what it is  it's got to be  more politically correct  because even though  it's anti-smoking  it's almost like  exploitation of  this poor guy  that was  that was fed  these cigarettes  by the tobacco  company  but look at the  drunk driving ads  they show  they show all these  little video games  that's true  that's true  you ever get  roped into one of those  and you're like  what  oh look at the  cute little kid 
[03:35:30]  on the swing  oh dead  murdered  whoever did that  is a genius  that is the most  brilliant  advertising  oh man  that's heavy  that gets to you  yeah you gotta stop  you're jerking off  you're like  alright I gotta quit  I gotta stop  through this one  the whole family  singing happy birthday  it's the kids  first birthday  oh I know  this kid's singing  don't drink and drive  ladies and gentlemen  he's in front of that  big cake  oh  oh it's just the worst  that's brutal  I curse my TV  when that stuff  comes on  they rope you in  like that 
[03:36:00]  why are you making  me feel bad  yeah those are  miserable  so  oh jeez  I'd put an end  to that conversation  certainly did  what a downer  yeah I know  thanks guys  so uh  hey you gotta back  time this  any suicides to report  today  you gotta back time this  cause we wanna play  Enemy today  the whole song  yep from Fozzy  which means we only  have a couple minutes  man this has gone by fast  it's already almost  11 o'clock  we had a real fast show  today I don't know  if we got anything  the show blew on by  well we took like  I think three breaks  the whole show  that's great  that's the beauty of XM  you don't need to  no commercial 
[03:36:30]  we talked like an hour  and a half at one point  without stopping  ask Chris about  Lita banging Edge  behind Matt Hardy's back  watch him squirm  watch who squirm  me  I don't know  I'm not squirming  about shit man  it's a shitty situation  and it's wrong  and it shouldn't have happened  yeah  and you know  I'm not squirming about it  I got nothing to be ashamed of  but it's bad business man  they fired Matt Hardy  as a result  how can you be sitting  at home  rehabbing your knee  and a month later  you lose your girlfriend  and your job 
[03:37:00]  for doing nothing wrong  you know what I mean  that is rough  yeah  that's the shit  that's  you know  there you go  there you go  so squirm on that  motherfucker  John Q  it's John Q  from Whackbag  Whackbag  Whackbag is one of the  websites that we  get critiqued on  all the time  that we were talking  about earlier  and we put the ones  that rule the world  and we pretend  we don't read  yeah  yeah exactly  and that we read  every post  and they say we don't  and we respond  under pseudonyms  dude  so China's clit 
[03:37:30]  oh Jesus  oh yeah wow  there you go  wow  yay or nay  it wrote a song  I heard  two guys in this room  say no fucking way  one guy saying  it's the hottest thing ever  okay first of all  I've never watched that  oh you want it  we got it right here  I can't  I can't  but it's bad  when China's clit  is bigger than  Xbox penis  yeah  that's the truth right  it was very comparable  both of them  and you like that  I like a big  I don't like the piercing  piercings always irritate me  but I like a  fucking midget thumb clit  I really like a big  nasty  so let me ask you a question  if you give the midget clit 
[03:38:00]  like head  does that make you gay  no  because there's a pussy  attached to it  of course not  okay  but it's the same  it's the same motion though  uh huh  it doesn't matter  so it's nodding  I mean if I think  something's an affirmative  I'm a homo  if you have your banana  in your mouth  while you do it  it's a different story  if you're nodding  it's not bad  it's a total different thing  nodding  hello hello  you should see him eat a banana  he grabs the back of his head  pushes into it  I like a big clit  I've always liked a big clit  I've always liked  I like pussy  and the more of it there is  the happier I am  yeah but that isn't more 
[03:38:30]  that that's  yeah that's like  that's like a skin flap  that you get a skin tag  when you like  you know have to get like  a third nipple or something  yeah exactly  it's not supposed to be right  it's like a spleen  it's not supposed to be there  it has no function whatsoever  I like it big man  big and thick and meaty  that's what I like  ooh dude  with some nice testicles  hanging under it  yeah  no no I don't want to  bag under it  push in the face  that awful little vagina  that looks like an Asian eye  who can  what do you do with that  you're done with it  you want it to be  you're done with that  in proportion  no I don't 
[03:39:00]  you want it to be in proportion  you want to be able to use  a tongue on it  without being able to use  like your lips  and move your head  back and forth  you don't want to actually  gag on it  yeah right  that's the number one rule  no gagging  cuddlingus is do not gag on it  you don't want to gag on it  when I come within three inches of a pussy  you ever see Alien  how it grabs your face  that's what I want to do  oh you want to blow out of the egg  just hold my face and pull me in  when you come within three inches of China's pussy  you're there  because it's got extra three inches  yeah there it is  I really like that  what we're looking at here  that's it  oh dude 
[03:39:30]  that's the reaction  that's actually a little bigger than I like  that was a natural reaction  isn't that just insane  if you just saw this bottom picture  it looks like my son's genitalia  a small penis in a sack  yeah  that's disgusting  I don't know  you've crossed the line  Opie and Anthony  you wouldn't work on that for a few minutes Sean  oh nice  work on it with a belt sander  that's right  down a reasonable size  anything Sean
