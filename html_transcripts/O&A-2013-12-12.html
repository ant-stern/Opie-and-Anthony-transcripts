<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of geopolitical issues – the US military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, fluctuating oil prices, and a conspiracy theory surrounding bank consolidation.  Caller Bill engaged in a debate with the hosts, expressing skepticism about corporate and governmental power, and predicting a rise in gold prices (a topic of past disagreement with Anthony).  The conversation touched on potential social unrest.

This segued into a wildly inappropriate "Bobo Dating Game" segment featuring Bobo (Daniel Bobo Coolin), two women vying for a date and $1,000, and guest Tracy Lords.  The segment was rife with vulgar and sexually explicit jokes focused on Bobo's physique and the women's reactions to him.  The unusual rule – the woman Bobo remembered most details about won – led to increasingly inappropriate questions and sexually suggestive comments.  Bobo ultimately chose a date, and the segment concluded with more sexually charged remarks.

The next segment revisited Bobo, who hadn’t won a prior contest.  The hosts and Bobo discussed the woman’s appearance before she joined them in the studio.  The conversation detailed explicit sexual expectations for a "good date," and further explored Bobo's insecurities and past relationships using vulgar language. A photo of Bobo requested by a female fan sparked a discussion and reenactments using a banana as a phallic stand-in.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Colin Quinn's controversial (but satirical) tweets about Will Ferrell and others, and the media's uncritical reporting.  Colin Quinn himself called in to clarify his intent, confirming the satirical nature of the tweets. This led back to discussions about dating, relationships, and various anecdotes from the hosts and callers, continuing the offensive humor and language.

A subsequent segment featured listener calls and personal anecdotes from the hosts. A caller recounted his wedding and honeymoon, followed by Sean from Indiana detailing his arrest for smuggling marijuana in his shoe. Opie and Anthony shared their own smuggling experiences (Cuban cigars), discussed past marriages, and lamented missed sexual opportunities, including a potential skinny-dipping incident.  They also discussed the death of an ex-wife,  the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports, and regret over missed opportunities with women.  Professional wrestler John Cena, promoting "12 Rounds," then appeared in-studio along with Joe Rogan.  The conversation included Cena's views on steroids, his upcoming Wrestlemania match and marriage, and further reminiscences about missed sexual encounters.  The discussion also touched upon Cena's movie career, Kurt Angle's past appearance on the show,  the hosts' opinions on various TV shows, and listener calls.

The show then moved to a discussion of cultural differences in sexual practices, specifically a claim regarding anal sex among some Arab women.  A DJ recounted a meeting with Michael Jackson in Bahrain, describing the opulent setting, Jackson’s appearance, and interactions with other celebrities like 50 Cent. The DJ also discussed djing at a Formula One race, and they debated Michael Jackson's fame compared to Muhammad Ali. This led to speculation about Jackson's death and the possibility of Tupac Shakur still being alive. The DJ offered predictions about future celebrity deaths, including Dick Clark.  A call-in segment followed with listeners sharing unusual sexual experiences with household objects. A discussion about Mighty Putty and the deaths of Billy Mays and another pitchman ensued.  The segment concluded with a heated phone interview with Bill Donahue of the Catholic League, sparked by Donahue's criticism of a *Curb Your Enthusiasm* episode. The discussion devolved into a heated exchange of insults and personal attacks over religious sensitivities, offensive humor, and perceived anti-Catholic bias in comedy.

The final segment featured multiple callers recounting sexually explicit childhood experiences, including genital rubbing against household objects.  Callers described instances of self-pleasure with various objects at a young age, and the hosts engaged in sexually suggestive dialogue and humor. The broadcast ended with plugs for their Facebook page and website.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  so honestly i i'm not a buyer on afghanistan and quite frankly i'm not a buyer on iraq you think  that you know the sectarian violence is it's spiking again uh again once we walk out of there 
[00:00:30]  and i don't know that we're actually going to leave iraq in the way that we've been talking  about i think we're gonna we're gonna have a long-term presence there i don't see how we  i think the permanent bases they built over there kind of gave that away yeah there was something to  that big compound with all the electricity and once they brought in cable tv bring up like tents  and stuff and they're gonna starboard over there and then they're gonna gradually yeah i think  take out everybody over there and then i think we'll have all the oil under our control and it'll  still be seven dollars a gallon somehow somehow they just won't be able to get us better technology 
[00:01:00]  than 35 miles a gallon we just can't fucking get past that number oh i don't know what it is all  the cars are safer they're heavier go fuck yourself you know what i heard yesterday the gas is still  expensive even though the price of uh oil has gone down something like 35 percent over the past couple  weeks uh the price at the pumps has only gone down about nine percent it's almost like they're so  big the government can't even control them it's almost like they're outside the boundaries of 
[00:01:30]  this country well one excuse i heard was it's the fact that the dollar is worth so little now because  they've just been pumping money out there that the price would have come down well that's that's a  whole other card now a gallon of gas is five dollars like there's a private corporation just  printing money that's almost it's almost it's like that it's almost like designed to fail to then  create a new currency and eventually work towards one world bank it's almost like that i knew it it's 
[00:02:00]  almost that not quite a 30 and we got to the one world government government oh yeah they're not  going to do that not at all the amerio europe has the euro what happens it's not working too well  well i'm not saying it's going to go great i'm just saying i think the germans want to go back to  the deutschmark and i'm not i'm not saying that like there's this one group of people the whole  world's just a bunch of gangs and i think that they try everybody's trying to be the guy i'm not  i'm not one of those guys you know i can't stand about conspiracy theory it's how immediately it goes 
[00:02:30]  to that immediately it goes to that like like the conspiracy his theory has just become synonymous  with moronic thought and this whole fucking country came about because of a conspiracy  the revolution was not a spontaneous act where everyone was just sitting and also legitimate  conspiracy there it's it's not the fact that there aren't such things as conspiracies we're planning  but when you but when you have one that's so out there what was out there about that it wasn't no  it wasn't that's just it you get a bunch of colonists they come over here they say that's not what i'm 
[00:03:00]  saying though i'm talking about started slowly becoming one world bank dude since i've been doing this  show we went from kind of 20 major banks we're down to like five when i was living in la you  couldn't find a chase manhattan they're all over the fucking place always guess right there used to  be delis and shit now there's fucking subways there used to be department stores now there's fucking  you know hardware stores now there's fucking home depots everything's conglomerating you just  compared yes it's a business you just compared that yes there are other legalized businesses buy 
[00:03:30]  up the smaller ones and you lose the legalized loan sharking yes it always has been but it doesn't  mean that this this conspiracy is is consolidating the banks it's business just like a hardware  stores being bought up by fucking lowe's and and home depot what's going on a shit that you've  argued with me about for the last five years that has now come about when i was telling you to buy  gold coins and you said i was a fucking moron no those things were like fuck you there were 500 
[00:04:00]  they were like 800 bucks and now they're like 1800 bucks what are you gonna do with your gold  coins man and then i'm going to canada and i'm getting like 80 cents on the dollar i can't even  afford a pair of fucking sneakers up there and i was like where's anthony now but i'm saying yes this  is happening anything i say to you you'd make it sound like i say that the the the fucking moon is  made out of cheese i agree with you saying this and that as he builds a compound and has an arsenal of  weapons you're a genius well you know i like i like your style you say i don't believe in that 
[00:04:30]  stuff on the dl but i imagine stay prepared though we're all yeah you got it you got to make some  contingency plans do you have a go bag bill uh see you're a guy that should have a go bag  some no i i love in los angeles which is a city that technically has no water supply there's no the  amount of people i know out there dude i got a cabin i got this cabin it's like well dude unless  you're in it when the shit goes down this is it's gonna be crazy what's fucked up about the united  states is like when you see like you know in japan like when that tsunami hit and but there's still 
[00:05:00]  like peace it's because they're all japanese over here it's like gangs in new york like shit it's  it's gonna be like the warriors when the dollar collections and people with their face painted  with baseball baseball bats that's gonna be insane i want to know why people live in gated  communities yeah what the fuck are you doing what are you doing security you know a high  number of oil executives live in gated yes they do because there's a lot of people that are after 
[00:05:30]  them right like bill yeah because they do they do business in such a way they're hard to back up  they really are despicable fucking people and i'm not a big conspiracy guy but i can't think of a  more hateable group of people than the fucking people that run the banks but i don't think the  only conspiracy here is the conspiracy to make money oh yeah no i know but i'm just not this grant  what like to however what's their end game to run things and be able to go no  what's their end game it's it's one like i don't even understand why that's like even fucking funny 
[00:06:00]  like oh shit yeah because it's an evil one leader guy no i'm not saying that i never said that that  is your general idea of conspiracy theory because whenever they show a conspiracy theory it's always a  guy with the fucking tinfoil on his head you know that's my impression of your thoughts on what this  is and i've never said that game i never said that there's one fucking guy doing that i've never 
[00:06:30]  saying that and why give me the the final solution to what they want okay did you have to phrase it  like that i know basically the game that they play right now which is to get everybody on the wheel  for 30 fucking years and right as you pay it off your gallbladder explodes and then your insurance  cancels you you got to kick you know you got to sell the house and they move another 30 year old in  there it's not enough just to be doing it to people here they want they want to keep growing what does 
[00:07:00]  it give them wait a minute now so we're talking about healthcare conspiracy because you're talking  about no no but they're all part of the same not organized together but it's part of that same  thought process that it's never enough i don't have a problem being controlled but my problem  with people like that is it's never enough it's never fucking enough like you think okay money or  power or both yeah it's never going to be enough that's what scares me about what like the bailout  money the fact that i mean am i out of my mind did i not see on the news that they can't even say 
[00:07:30]  where it is or who got it yeah it's not and it's just like whatever but you snatch your fucking purse  they got your face on every goddamn telephone pole out there how come i don't know what these bankers  look like how come these guys don't go to jail there's no accountability because it's like  anything like like in this because they're bigger that they have too much fucking money  they're beyond being prosecuted at this point so what would you like to do what do you want to do  with them that's a whole nother that's a whole nother argument i'm not saying i have the solution  what i'm saying is what's going on is fucked up saying this is what pisses me off but yeah so what 
[00:08:00]  so what's wrong with doing that no what i'm trying to stop here is if you bring this thank you yeah  see no i'm saying you're right to say you're pissed off and talk about it you don't need to  have a solution because that tends to be you think it's an organized conspiracy of a few people  that have a plan like like i don't know no no no no this is what look i'm saying like banks  they're basically trying to get down to one bank they're trying to eliminate all their other  competitions the way they do in any business but in this fucking business that's unbelievably dangerous 
[00:08:30]  if you get all if you get all the way down to one bank yeah okay then i mean what am i going to do  when they say okay the interest is 30 on loan and i go fuck yourself then no no you go fuck yourself  because we have all the goddamn money you're the only problem with that is that it's not in the  bank's interest to not have any competition because of the way the banking system is structured they  have to have competition and they have to have liquidity within the various banking industries  to to make this work so i mean the idea why why well that's a whole nother conversation i'm not 
[00:09:00]  saying i got a solution here i'm just saying i'm just because i agree with in a sense that that  there was no accountability for the bailout you could argue that that was a government issue if you  if you control all of the money why would that be in your bad why would that be in in your it's  not i mean a it's never going to happen because of regulation we're down to like five banks so  they understand no we're not down to five banks wouldn't it implode i'm just saying five like  major banks you got what do you got you got wells fargo you got chase washington whatever the fuck 
[00:09:30]  that is that's gone ernie banks i always thought that was a terrible name for ernie city yeah so  get rid of those guys why have that competition yeah uh what else you got you got city you got bank  of america yeah when i say five i mean this is like yeah very few left it's basically what i'm saying  it's not literally i understand yeah but don't you think one bank my my point being is i'm always  fascinated by the the notion that you know somehow business is out that screw us over constantly i  mean and i'm saying this in part because i run i run a small business it's a small business but 
[00:10:00]  it's still a business i'm out there i want to make as much fucking money as i can right and i'd like to  get my business as big as i possibly can right i don't think that makes me a bad person that just  makes me want to make as much fucking money and get as big a fucking business as possible  bill is hilarious oh my god now bill why do you find that funny yeah business man wanting yes  because call me crazy because i want to make money yeah at your level yeah at your level when you open  your lemonade stand yeah it's all about customer service absolutely hello i'm mr so-and-so i run the 
[00:10:30]  lemonade stand can i help you sir would you like another napkin this is my dream i'm talking about  when you get to a fucking insane love how many stories have been on the news where they show these  giant corporations who do the wrong fucking thing just so they can eke out another dollar  yeah you could fly in a fucking airplane selfish yeah that doesn't make them  conspiracy no i know no no no no no no but what he's suggesting is that if i'm running a business  i want to do what's best for the customer no it's all relative no wait wait now you're doing 
[00:11:00]  what's that's not that's not now you're putting words in my mouth that's what it sounded like you  that's what it sounded like you were saying okay i'm not saying i'm saying i'm running a business i  want to make as much money money as i can and i would like to get my business as big as  possible that doesn't make me a bad fucking person and if someone opens up a lemonade  depending depending on how you go about it yes it does what well now you're at a morality issue  yeah business where the fuck have you been for 200 years it doesn't work that way really saying  what i'm saying you jack i know jesus christ but i'm saying jesus fucking christ i give up putting 
[00:11:30]  too much i'm saying it louder no you're putting too much emotion into it and morality into it i'm  looking at it like business is fucked they're greedy selfish people that want to make money  i'm not looking at it like you're spelling it out that yes yes they're not trying to this big brained  guy i never said that i never ever said that i never said that marionette i never said that i  find it hard i find it hard to believe they would ever work together like like the greed does play a 
[00:12:00]  partner whereas work together i can't picture any room where because look at the chinese there's a  billion of them and they're never going to want to be a part of something that is shared this is  unreal you guys have a conversation about something i never said for the ninth time i'm not saying  there's one fucking guy no not one you're saying that i'm not saying you're saying that there's  certain groups oil companies insurance companies and banks are working together no i'm not saying that  okay i'm saying they're business they are too big to be controlled right they're too big to be 
[00:12:30]  controlled which is why their greed is so out of fucking control i'll even go with you on that  they i actually think that there's enough money if if they wouldn't fucking just if it wasn't so  goddamn corrupt and they didn't pay forty dollars for a fucking hammer you don't think that we could  afford health insurance see about now the amount of morality and the amount of goddamn money  it's not even like morality and compassion has no place in 99 of the businesses out there it just 
[00:13:00]  doesn't they don't think of it that way it's a horrible i understand that they don't yeah so  we're saying the same thing so you don't have a you just go hey this is the way it is and blah blah  blah blah blah and i actually get upset by it and your your point this is what it really is we're both  saying it exists i get upset by it and you just say hey that's the way it is yeah you know that's  it so then there's no point in arguing then i'm done hmm case closed no it's not like case closed  it's just it's there's no no because we're saying the same thing we we are we're saying the same thing 
[00:13:30]  i misunderstood i thought you had it probably because of all the yelling i do yeah you were in  a good mood when you came in here that ends real quick no that's not i just i don't you know what it  is dude i don't buy anything i just think it's all fucking bullshit it's all bullshit have you like  they don't even they don't even give a fuck about people in this country yeah and if there isn't money  to be made they don't give a shit about people over there it's all got a guy give him the freedom 
[00:14:00]  and blah blah blah no i don't buy any of it worst speech ever given was eisenhower at the end of his  presence that the industrial military complex people have explained to me what that means and i still  watch the speech and i don't get it i don't know why he should have talked like the common man  and then listen really there's going to be best buy in the future  and that's going to be a bad thing what uh what was part of his speech though with the uh 
[00:14:30]  what was that the industrial military complex he was basically saying that big business was going  to start controlling our foreign policy i think that that's what it is i swear to god i could watch  it 200 times somebody could diagram it i have no idea what the fuck he's talking about he definitely  looks disturbed he looks upset the industrial military complex it's like somebody told him  40 degrees r2 ready break i don't know what the fuck you're talking about and everybody always has

[00:16:00]  has turned into a guarantee of happiness and an entitlement of happiness and happiness equals money  uh so you're the bad guy and unless you give your shit to somebody that doesn't have it  you're fucking despicable i just worked in utah and i had a pretty good weekend i did okay i made a  little bonus all went to taxes in utah all of it went to utah i didn't get my credit they grab you  by your ankles and they turn you upside down absolutely shake it out of your and how i get

[00:18:30]  you know this is great how can you how can you stop them from overpaying like everybody wants to  work for the state because they want to lean on a fucking shovel and not do anything and then  everybody wants to get the government contracts so they can overcharge everybody because you got  whoever the hell's writing the goddamn checks it's not really your money so when you overcharge  i mean half the people out i'm not half the people typical uh stat i'll throw out there but i bet a lot  of the fucking people who are taking those government contracts will then turn around and bitch about 
[00:19:00]  their taxes after they just got done right overcharging the people yeah they're part of the  problem and they're bitching about it when they go to yeah all these construction things you know  they always that'll be like that's why nine thousand dollars per bag of concrete that's why when when  it came uh time to vote on uh the nassau coliseum and the islanders uh i live in nassau county and i  went out and voted no because they wanted us to cough up millions upon millions of dollars in tax 
[00:19:30]  money to rebuild the nassau coliseum a minor league ballpark um and uh revamp the area yeah yeah i'm  like fuck fuck that no i'm not doing it uh so i voted no and and a lot of people voted no the whole  bill didn't pass i'm like and people are bitching at me you know how many jobs are going to be lost  uh the islanders are going to leave this i go no it's not going to happen they will stay they're  going to get private sector money like they should and fucking build it from the private sector the 
[00:20:00]  jobs will be there it'll be private investors that want to recoup their money they want to save money  i'm going to give the government who who we're in we're in debt already in this county in nassau  county where i live right i'm going to give them millions more no i don't understand boondoggle  fucking uh uh overpriced a roller derby rink yeah a roller derby rink i don't understand how do the  owners of these teams get to to like blackmail these states like we're gonna leave states should 
[00:20:30]  start going well then fucking leave leave go yeah it's your business who cares you're making all this  money pay for your own don't goddamn by the way the second you leave an island your name becomes very  silly yeah the islanders the tennessee islanders the lakers what stop it you look i own islanders  yeah yeah yeah you've got like three places you can move to catalina  hawaii nantucket hawaii nantucket martha's vineyard  yeah i i i don't trust the government with tax money they've proven time and time again they can't 
[00:21:00]  make it work you don't think the government can spend our money wisely and efficiently  i haven't seen it amazing right but that's fucking no accounting for those bone the bailout  money given no accounting the only answer and i won't say is literally to physically drag people  out of buildings um and and fucking uh you've all seen footage of what they do in third world  countries to a rapist that is the only way to handle this if that happened what what do they do  uh they usually like them on burn them alive and shoot them pat them on the back yeah good job what 
[00:21:30]  did she do yes and look at another man but i mean uh it's the only it's the only answer it's the only  way that they will stop doing that is if they know that the uh the penalty is to be dragged down into  the street and fucking shot it's the i'm telling you it sounds like a crazy thing to say but it might  make him straighten up and fly right hey look fucking madoff is a very rare case of a guy whose life  really is ruined son committed suicide his wife left him like he's a very rare case of a guy  who really got what he deserved and he really had to fuck up and that's i love this case too because 
[00:22:00]  now you got people arguing because there were people that got in there that actually made money  right made a lot of money yeah uh because he was he was paying them and they were kind of feeding the  system by introducing other people and anyway so now they're arguing they're trying to keep  the money that not only that they invested with him but that the money that he gave them  through this whole ponzi which was basically just other people's money people we didn't make  any money no absolutely he didn't make any money whatsoever so there's this big legal battle 
[00:22:30]  with the trustee and the trustee wants to get all that money back he's saying you didn't make that  money that's stolen money give me that money back you can get the money back that you invested  with him you know and then but i want the i want that your profit so-called profit and people  defending their money sound greedy like they're greedy but if i invested money like i have money  in the market if all of a sudden it turns out my guy was a thief as much as i feel pulled out  before i would be like what the fuck these are my investments like i did the right thing 
[00:23:00]  i wasn't stealing you know it's the problem gets is if he actually gives money back to one guy and  gave him a major profit to keep feeding the scam of the ponzi scheme so then that guy takes that  money and now he goes to invest it and he's in a certain amount of debt and that's well that's  stolen money i guess he could sell whatever property but it's not as simple as like well that's stolen  money you got to give it back it's like the person you're looking at your bank figures like you think  this amount of money so you go start living this life yes um but it but like funding the mets 
[00:23:30]  yeah that was a good one no but the thing is is but the both sides are kind of right it's weird it's  that's that's gonna be a tough one and the fact that they let him go in a minimum security prison  that's another problem it's like i mean his life stinks because his personal life but he should be  forced to be in a hurry exactly even though make a shank out of his tie tack a guy like that though  would probably be taken care of in jail because he's fucking such a genius that he could tell  these guys how to tell people to make money on the outside  that guy's a commodity lawyers do okay in jail i mean next year mr madoff was doing tax returns 
[00:24:00]  but you know nothing makes someone feel like a man  yeah drinking a nice cold beer yeah some cold suds  fucking why do i think that movie drink up ladies so overrated that movie i'm sorry  like escape from alcatraz enough already drinking his beer we got it fucking bugs me and viking rapes  him you don't like that viking i liked it but it was that's what i thought you know what i liked

[01:22:00]  really tired and she was just wanted to go home and go to sleep so maybe if you can take her  somewhere to go nap you guys could you should probably see a movie after david busters i'm  thinking oh that would be good maybe you could i could take her to see the gang theater not in one  of the gang theaters no you could go to the gang theater and then uh rub her leg you got to know  how to make a movie theater that's nicer that i won't be likely to get shot in  i don't trust those movie theaters in that neighborhood why bobo neighborhood i keep 
[01:22:30]  hearing about that neighborhood all right what's wrong with the neighborhood no the gangs that run  those theaters all right i hear stuff i went to a high school that had way too many blacks with  attitudes that's how tipper gar marketed them did you uh yeah did you get uh did you used to get  bullied by some of the african-american students some of them frightened me not all but some 
[01:23:00]  i want everything he says as a clip i think we went to the same high school  so some of them frightened you yeah i mostly see like the vibe they give off like how they greet me  yeah how do they greet you with a big punch in the face how do they greet you bobo run your pockets  i know let me hold a dollar retard well for one thing let me see your cell phone one way i knew for 
[01:23:30]  sure wow if they obsessively cursed i know i couldn't trust them ah yes so if it was like  hey motherfucker if they come up to you went hey motherfucker yeah like that i didn't trust them  and i didn't trust ones that greeted tried greeting me with the n-word either how would they do that  though why would they call you that i don't know they freaking they they don't those kind of  freaking thing that they they get some greeting they think you can just use it as however they 
[01:24:00]  want it offends you yeah it offends me like they use every one that we're always taught not to use  that word right like that and they're just using it what they want what's wrong with them all right  they they don't want to be treated why would they call you that they don't want to be called that  and you know what let me tell you something when they call each other uh that it's it's a a term of  endearment it's a greeting and if they're calling you that i would think that would be kind of  respectful yeah but the thing is it's not how i always it i always thought of that word at all right 
[01:24:30]  i i always assume that it would bug them from all the years of the the years that they've gone  through all right what did what did they go through well well some of their ancestors gone through  slavery so what did that was like an insult to them what i'm saying i think they would they would have  more respect and realize that they got that they were given this opportunity for what their  ancestors fought for setting the race cause back um centuries yeah we we are out of time by the way 
[01:25:00]  gave you the opportunity we're gonna we're gonna have to wrap this up uh you two have a great time  um what what oh i got a plug of course i do yes this whole extravaganza uh please get closer with  triple tested quality trojan bearskin condoms trojan america's number one most trusted  condom brand we want to thank trojan for uh putting on this shindig it's been fantastic you  get to go out on a date and uh make sure they get your info the next uh compound party you are  cordially invited thank you uh as a consolation prize because uh i can't bear the thought that you um 
[01:25:30]  you didn't get uh you had the thousand dollars because we just wanted to make this as evil as  possible for bobo bobo any last words i don't want i don't want to know when that acts like a 20 to  look to go oh  this is the worst of the open anthony show sirius xm  you're laughing at already jimmy just read the colin quinn tweets oh my god 
[01:26:00]  that guy is the funniest guy can we get him on the he's out of his mind did we try to get him on  the air he's big news today we should get him on the air can i ask where this is this from one of  the papers yeah yeah what one of the core or or it's online well soon to be in the papers yeah  colin took over twitter yesterday man he's he's the king yeah he was the guy colin quinn is the king 
[01:26:30]  he's the king of the twitter was he really yeah man he was making news and everything  it's hilarious he was making blog sites what huffington i guess yeah huffington uh went oh my  god it went to the the mail online at the uk yes yes what what dummies people are they are  look at that headline i was into a lot of bad drug stuff no he was he saw that will  will ferrell stole anchorman concept yeah colin quinn jokes that will ferrell stole anchorman concept 
[01:27:00]  and takes drugs but they don't think it's a joke no no because because the media is stupid  well he said it says jokes there so that's kind of that that kind of this article came out later  because yeah three paragraphs and it says however it appears they just fail to spot a good-natured bit  of joshing a good-natured bit of joshing don't you know yes yes colin quinn but comedian but this is 
[01:27:30]  late in the story because a lot of people were buying into it for a while what jim's reading is from  the hollywood reporter and the only oh god and the only reason they know it was a joke is because  colin got scared yeah colin started going off fuck maybe this isn't a good idea maybe maybe i'll get  in trouble like look at the headline on huffington post yeah uh colin quinn rips will ferrell on twitter  he stole anchorman has a drug problem colin colin said i think he said on the show he was just 
[01:28:00]  that he said to cnn like you guys are so dumb like like i'm scared that you don't get it right  yeah some of the quotes read it jimmy read i couldn't believe that's what it just made me laugh  fuck my halloween story who gives a fuck this is way better i i just it hit me he goes uh  ferrell recently received the mark twain award and it seems quinn was not a fan of that  it says uh anybody see will ferrell at mark twain awards last night great for him i guess  like who takes that seriously i know who the fuck takes that seriously no i'm happy for will 
[01:28:30]  we never really got along at snl because he took so many of my ideas but he continued that's his  whole he took so many of my ideas and the whole thing when uh what's the lorne michaels one i'm  that's in two and and it's the one that made me laugh yeah that one's hilarious then quinn escalated  his comments by saying will was in a lot of bad drug stuff and i don't know if he still is  actually not true i happen to know he's still very much so then quinn goes on to target lauren  michaels target he goes uh the years at snl lauren really was kind of messed up over various things 
[01:29:00]  and i was the shot caller he's saying he produced snl during the years he was there and i was the  shot call it like called the shot who the fuck believes that apparently a lot of dumb people we  are really oh then in the last one he goes uh he goes uh oh he said a couple hours later quinn  seemed to apologize for his remarks but at the same time threw in another zinger i feel bad about  the whole will ferrell cop feel bad about the will ferrell comments i'll never mention him again if 
[01:29:30]  he pays me my residuals for the whole anchorman concept what business dumb motherfucker business  insider why yeah the headline says colin quinn may have just accused will ferrell of stealing the  concept for anchorman from him i hope will ferrell gets it he has to oh yeah he totally gets it  he absolutely gets it yeah yeah that's how famous will ferrell is though like uh  movie line uh colin quinn tweets that will ferrell had a bad drug problem 
[01:30:00]  yeah will ferrell's gotta fucking read that and just laugh his ass off like you hope so colin  yeah you hope you hope you hope so i would think so it's you know what it is though it's a  price it's brilliant because it first of all it's just funny on the on the surface it's funny  shit to read but you dig down deeper and and that's pure colin is taking something like twitter  and showing everyone how ridiculous it is and how easy it is to take something that is social 
[01:30:30]  networking and twist things around and actually make people believe anything and everybody wants  to be first to print it so right colin quinn is saying that you know friend will ferrell is a  drug addict and he stole anchorman from me they're like fuck we got to get this up on our blog  and they're reporters but nobody does any homework they just get these tweets sent to them they don't  scroll back they don't care insane they're copy pasters they're not reporters anymore they're copy  pasters that's exactly what you said sam yeah yeah they don't they they don't do any uh background 
[01:31:00]  checking at all they just go with it because they would they need to be the first one un-fucking  believable they just don't care they don't uh oh you know how you know the copy and paste  when we we mentioned patrice bob kelly is the one who actually said and it doesn't matter like  bob kelly said it and but they were saying jim norton said and they were using bob kelly now i know  some guys don't know bob's voice or they couldn't tell the difference between bobby and i and i get  that but when every when you see one printed and then you see bop bop bop all these other ones  printed it was like all you're doing is reporting what they reported like you're doing no homework 
[01:31:30]  yourself you're doing no original work it's like fucking lazy man happens all the  fucking time they're just lazy what else they have to do during the day they're not doing a  radio show all you have to do is you know uh fact check like they can't listen to audio themselves  first of all here it's two different voices but then just do their own homework and maybe come up  with an angle themselves or use their own words no terrible copy paste get it up on the site boom move  on exactly it unbelievable how gullible and just yeah complete lack of reporting well well colin said it 
[01:32:00]  uh and there's there's no accountability which you know that's the biggest part like does it matter  is somebody gonna get oh one of these new news agencies uh gonna get in trouble or is the reporter  uh gonna catch heat from whatever superior they have because they printed something that wasn't true  or or real or printed it like it was true no because everyone accepts the fact that if it's written down 
[01:32:30]  even if it's on twitter it must be true well the stakes are too high so they're all in on it  steaks we got a steaks back there steaks are too high they're doing gambling all the time just  hoping you know what they just read is true as they put it on their site yep uh sleeves has a  colin quinn song that's what coke logic is telling me no one understands them  fa la la la la la la hair like he combed it with an m80 fa la la la la jaymore does his voice 
[01:33:00]  fa la la la la got skinny little legs fa la la la la breakable cancer fingers la la la la nobody likes  him fa la la la la he's a dirty fucking rosacea irish face  slow you can so break his fingers easily oh god dude am i looking at them well  well you know uh we got to hear the sleeves colin quinn song oh who wouldn't want to  the radio ghost himself leaves radio ghost what does that mean chase some 
[01:33:30]  fucking leaves face down  like see the last shot and that is him just going down the river face first  yeah you're leading the leaves by dead example  you got it yeah let's hear it  oh god here it is it's buffering by the someone's fired is that really it's buffering  i mean we all have am i right right completely right 
[01:34:00]  it's a terrible thing that can never be taken back  this can never be taken back colin ever it's ugly stuff stuff that i keep saying never again  then what do you do now you wake up and what do you find upon waking oh my god 
[01:34:30]  what is this he's using me on this one what is this and i'm a big fan of sleeves but  i'm exposing him  can you buy to see will farrow at mark twain awards last night great for him not bitter but just you know  you know what is he doing you know what is he doing what is this  get it  good for you 
[01:35:00]  will was into a lot of bad  i don't know if he still is  actually that's not true  i happen to know he still is  very much  i have no idea what that was reading tweets  i was actually liking that one  really by the way colin tweeted i guess  at the end to all media etc will ferrell was not on drugs at snl i never even saw him smoke a 
[01:35:30]  joint is this what it's come to with three question marks say i guess he had to because  it's like you know he's kidding me but it's a great way to end the whole thing it's like  he was getting scared it exposes everybody because will would have fun with that he was  getting scared he got some pressure for some from some people behind the scenes i'm assuming  somebody just said dude you just got to say you're joking yeah  it's a great way to end it because it's not like hey i apologize for this and it's like look 
[01:36:00]  hey idiots do you even fucking get this i want to see more headlines sam  uh i was just reading some of his other tweets that didn't make the article oh really right  after he tweeted the lord michaels thing he tweeted there's things going on right now secret  things behind the scenes type stuff that i think will catapult me into the best of the best  and uh yeah right on yeah holy shit feel bad about the will ferrell comments i'll never mention him 
[01:36:30]  again if he pays me my my residuals for the whole anchorman concept he stole he stole the concept  he wants his residuals i don't like the fact that sam read one that i just read yes and and did the  same thing i did with the capital letters put emphasis on it oh the whole like that i like that  yeah and he repeated what i said oh boy what's going on with you today roberts oh no yeah you  would be on beretta's shoulder he's getting very antsy sitting there i see that you know who doesn't 
[01:37:00]  do that to him i see that mother i'm sure he'll be doing antsy's jokes soon too oh and gypsies wait  a minute yeah you gotta read the different tweets sam you're reading the same thing detective monahan  heard that ah quince gee i don't know she's only five come on they look so nice when they're that young  i'm the colonel i don't touch him i just look at him look at him  ah shit so that's a that's a big one today we got to get calling on i didn't have no i someone i 
[01:37:30]  saw on twitter said something yeah i just hadn't seen kyle's tweets i wasn't looking at twitter  yesterday yeah god damn yeah it's uh it was just it was hilarious it's the perfect way to expose twitter  and expose these fucking idiots whether it's just a another guy tweeting that's sitting around and  can't fucking understand sarcasm or these dumb ass fucking people in the media there's a panic going 
[01:38:00]  on though yeah because a lot of a lot of people on twitter are getting the story before mainstream  news they're getting it out there first so now what do you do you got to gamble but it's also a  mixture of real journalism well not even real journalism like mainstream media and just a blogger all  of a sudden it becomes the same fucking thing but break it down colin's tweeting this crazy  shit what do you do do you try to call his people knowing that everyone else is reading twitter and  you know someone is going to grab it and go with it so then you think to yourself well colin yeah isn't 
[01:38:30]  known to be this crazy uh off the top off the cuff type of guy he isn't in in the mainstream yeah  so they go fuck i let's we have to go with this you know yeah i don't have time to confirm it  no because someone else is going to someone else is just going to run with it anyway so i might as  well right what what is that one no just when you google news him once the articles about uh will  ferrell stop the last twitter fiasco that he started about gaddafi is he just he's brilliant and if you 
[01:39:00]  did a second of research you would understand that colin is never serious on twitter ever we got  colin oh good yeah and we got bill burns studio uh colin quinn everyone colin hey guys how's it  going hey buddy hey colin you sound like you sound like a colin you sound like a beaten man after  yesterday just chill and listen to some music oh can you know again  what's he doing he's listening to beaver he's a believer you love the babes i'm a believer 
[01:39:30]  what's up guys uh bill you heard about colin he's in deep trouble today oh i heard all about  it yeah it was trending colin quinn was trending yes on twitter yes he was it's scary how stupid  they are is it it's ridiculous it really is like you you continually expose these idiots for for what  they are just like knee-jerk no research whatsoever all you would have to do is search colin 
[01:40:00]  colin quinn's twitter and you'd realize he's done this before and it's it's documented why take  everything he says on twitter as fact and print it like oh my god he's he's accusing means it because  he means it that's did you mean it oh okay i i'm my mistake i started out the morning on a positive  note talking about the uh potential intriguing employment stuff going on with me and then uh  i just mentioned that will farrell stole like a man from me yeah of course then of course i made 
[01:40:30]  up the drug thing so that becomes a big thing the drug thing and they ran with it but did they ran  with it did you hear from anybody because that's like uh because you yeah that's why i had to say  hey man you know first my manager was like hey you know i told you troll but then i was like nah man  that's what we always do too man we're like nah man we know what we're doing right it's good  we knew so did you send out a tweet that finally said it was a joke you fucking retards yeah but i  want to hear uh leading up to that so then the manager is going whoa colin and you're like come 
[01:41:00]  on man this is all right and then what happened the manager answers the phone to his credit yeah they  go we asked one site goes we asked colin quinn's manager for a response to the column series and he  just laughed and laughed and hung up is that what your manager's doing laughing and hanging up  that's what you want your manager yeah yeah when all hell's breaking loose that's what you want  from your manager he goes click yeah i actually like that just treat them like the idiots that they 
[01:41:30]  are yeah right don't dignify it with a response so you uh did will call you or his manager because  what happened where you finally had to go like look you morons i was joking yeah because i know will  and i know his manager's matches like hey man you know i'm getting like 50 calls can you please  say something i am saying something it was just about the drug yeah of course yeah i go what is  i said tell will i'm sorry he goes he's on a plane i didn't even know any of this is going on 
[01:42:00]  yeah like will what's your drug problem you know yeah you know what you should have said  colin you should have said will he be mad that's that's a good one is that chip of course  what else would it be it's hard to tell chip from jim these days yeah i can't even argue with him  so so will farrell have you heard from will farrell at all no no i don't but really you know what's  he gonna say you know well i don't know that's just it it was my whole thing you know see you're 
[01:42:30]  still not you're not letting that not letting that one go are you no i was like hey i'm ron  burgundy i would come in the office joking around like that same name and everything wow my favorite  tweet was when you said that like lauren was falling apart and you were calling the shots  calling the shots yeah people were tweeting back at me like you won't call it you know but of course  even in a couple of media things you know colin quinn claims that he was you know running snl secretly  you know yeah what dummies it's just stupid that was the tweet that got them that i was calling the 
[01:43:00]  shots over it yeah but it's amazing how stupid they are like they literally just like we said  before copy and paste what some other person has written or a blogger and they don't do any homework  or read the context in which these tweets are written no did uh thanks for adding to that  that was your turn colin yeah exactly that was your turn i hit the ball over the net what  it's hard when you're at the studio yeah it is you feel like i feel like everybody's sitting there 
[01:43:30]  after each silence going okay let's get off this goddamn phone now no there's a few people have  rolled their eyes but that's about it really do you know colin could do that that again today and  people will still just think he's he's for real yeah they're they're idiots they do no research  whatsoever how many uh how many followers do you lose well at first i lost 800 at the beginning but  then i got a couple more now i'm back i'm almost even to where i started yesterday 
[01:44:00]  twitter blackjack yeah i'm about even his twitter stats is like a roller coaster you're insane  yeah every time you're finally over a hundred thousand but every time you got close you decide  to blow it up and lose but this is how this is exactly how twitter should be used like anyone who  takes it seriously is an asshole i mean colin is mocking the whole thing i love it the best is  when like some guy like attacks you know like some guy attacks for me and they start attacking 
[01:44:30]  poor idiot this doesn't get it and like they just ruined them like some girl yesterday was like  sounds like somebody's jealous you know yeah spreading negativity makes you look like a fool  and guys are like shut up you dirty hole  yeah they they react to a spitball with a howitzer  one guy just writes back aids aids aids aids aids  that's probably one of ours yeah probably i think i'm being polite 
[01:45:00]  i love those people trying to get philosophical and teach you a life lesson through a tweet in 140  characters you're gonna get enlightened you know as confucius always said  shut the fuck up you think confucius used the word the letters you are for your  and yeah yeah we're just trying to write ul just  that's very funny jimmy 
[01:45:30]  oh that's it look at look at the big uh the big book uh out there from chris matthews  yes scumbag who wouldn't come on our show about jfk it's really it's really this is we need another  book about jfk because we don't know every fucking thing they're part you know he fucked  maryland why would he come on your show because he's a douchebag that's why he he was booked and  then you know a dumb excuse uh was had which means he found out i guess who we are or something  yeah his publicist probably listened to the show it was like oh you don't want to go on the show on  that show yeah they'll actually read your book and then tell you what they think of it 
[01:46:00]  and they don't care about your influence in this business it's a look inside his childhood  uh gives a shit gives a privileged fucking childhood what's that he's from philly no we  mean jfk oh  i read a book about when i was a little kid i know by the way i know i'm going to get disconnected by  you are for this when i was a little kid because you guys are going to be signaling yay no no i read  a book about okay and it really was quite an impacting book it was like he used to eat toast he had a fight 
[01:46:30]  he had a piece of toast and he got on the bus and he had a fight with the kid who turned out to be  his best friend that's always a nice way to start things off humorous anecdote yeah i wish you were  here yesterday we could have had chris matthews and done an hour on that so the toast incident  chris did you write about that go go hey you um use toast as a metaphor for what jfk was yeah  like he was wearing toast on his head and it got shut off a bunch of jelly jelly on it someone threw  butter from the grassy knoll well the only the only uncalled for thing yesterday was in the middle 
[01:47:00]  of each twitter war and all these media things was once in a while somebody would just trash and go  and by the way voss  voss never gets off unscathed but by the way kyle this is why  this is why uh i told you you shouldn't have uh you should have gone on pierce morgan without  warning that producer you should have just on tv just said it's a it's a joke you should have 
[01:47:30]  shamed them you were too nice that was for the other one i know i know but i'm saying you should  have shamed them publicly how about the fact that i get off the end train i had to go do a uh  like a little thing i don't call it that thing and oh  i got the end of course about 11 30 at night i come up my station there's a picture of bill burr  on the middle of the car  i would love to see in that picture your face 
[01:48:00]  did you just look down at your phone real quick and not look up until you're on 56  so i just took my phone and i made somebody take a picture of my face over his  i don't think we could believe anything colin says anymore no  a confirmed twitter liar but lies just a phony baloney yep yeah mr quinn yeah you better go  back to tweeting or something right yeah yeah you know colin you could have been uplifting with your  fame instead of spreading all that negativity too right you're right like uh one of the kardashians 
[01:48:30]  that's why they have too many followers because they put in positivity yeah what was your  i started the morning that's a positive notes i was saying really good stuff what was your favorite  headline you read yesterday about yourself um i don't know i didn't really know what is it  colin quinn slams let's see what this one says colin quinn tweets that will ferrell had a bad drug  problem then they just go over my timeline and they they even have my early day like in the early part  of the day yeah i was tweeting like feeling a lot of good things going on in the world right now for 
[01:49:00]  me a lot of positivity and they like tweet those too i don't even explain like why why you said  that exactly like a bunch of idiots can they look at you and realize you couldn't feel good  now they know he's joking around they're just taking it seriously so all the  they're pandering to the morons something to talk about yeah yeah exactly you think that plays into  it too they don't care if that's right then someone i'm walking in walmart someday after a  crummy gig in the road some old lady's gonna throw something at me you leave will ferrell alone 
[01:49:30]  i just love that he just said crummy like he was on leave it to beaver crummy  gee gee beef that's crummy that guy's a creep or something yeah they're all sticks in the mud call  don't be such a wet end what's a wet end what's a wet end it's just like a drip  i heard that one before you drip yeah it's like a drip yeah you love that expression drip wet noodle  drip is great like yep well well colin congratulations on the the big uh fame thing

[01:56:00]  even know what it's like i certainly didn't know what that was about because who's talked about like  the crying stuff the crying stuff yeah we were talking about like like uh to somebody about about  that whole thing and um how you try to break up it was one of the comics that were here uh oh they  start crying and they start crying so you can't fucking you're like okay i'm sorry sorry it was me  you ever um you ever not break up with a girl because you you really feel like you're such a an 
[01:56:30]  amazing person that they'll kill themselves yeah yeah yeah i knew you were gonna say oh jim jeffries it  was jim jeffries that said that yes you feel you're so fucking amazing that they are not going  to be able to live without you and if you break up with them they will absolutely kill themselves  how fucking egotistical and pompous is that but it's fucked up on so many levels because now you're  sacrificing it's gonna happen but you're sacrificing your own happiness right no because you know you're 
[01:57:00]  such a great catch for this one that she can't live without you dude that is so fucking true  what a fucking loser man you know why did you leave i just i've never done anything to hurt you  and then you're like oh my god she's gonna fucking kill herself i better hang in there because i am  such a great catch all right sweetie i can't i can't leave her like this i'm sorry i'm sorry don't don't  kill yourself right oh holy shit what's that about could you just hold me all right i never had one of 
[01:57:30]  those i'll hold you i'll hold you like fucking like oh go ahead say it i don't care just say it  uh oh you know what that's great yeah ronnie b right on with some logic about this like joaquin  phoenix held his father in gladiator that's how i want to hold you oh fuck jesus 
[01:58:00]  sean in jersey yo what's up hey buddy yeah you know ronnie b had the best saying he said what the  girls love about you in the beginning is the shit they can't stand about you went like right  before you know the point it's like he he just had the best he summed it up in one you know easy  thing yeah and which you just didn't well he sort of did no i know it's it up a little i know what he 
[01:58:30]  means yeah the the stuff they love about you in the end they end up hating about they hate it is  basically what you want to say yeah but i i gotta also say there there's the other side of that where  you'll get a girl who you uh hooked up with that dress like a fucking whore and then toward the  middle end of the relationship you don't want to go on out like that it's like what are you doing  right but some put some goddamn clothes on a lot of guys get like that you know that overprotective 
[01:59:00]  thing i uh uh you know i won't name names just to protect the whatever these fucking whores but  jesus christ these money-grubbing fucking shit fucking holes so i'll just say this i i was with  somebody and i'm like you know i was like wow yeah this is all right yeah by the end of the  relationship i'm like who the fuck is this person where i felt like i'm like who are you  who are you slipped next to a bean pod and someone else woke up but you wake up one day who the 
[01:59:30]  fuck are you what happened to that that other version of you where's the cool chick right where's  the cool girl right what happened how come now everything i do sucks it was amazing really how  about how about all of a sudden she she likes completely different things like what when did  this happen i would never go out with you i would go out with the old version yeah yeah this is something  you're an imposter right you're fucking an imposter i like to think i'm kind of the same person 
[02:00:00]  through a relationship who knows i mean there's there's two sides to every story  what are you gonna do  but yeah they laugh and laugh let's go to vince in new hampshire vince  hey guys how you doing this morning hey man hey uh i got a story about a crazy girlfriend that tried  to kill herself yeah um within two months of meeting her i was like great great great crazy as 
[02:00:30]  shit i spent the next year trying to get out of the relationship going to therapy with her  finally i think i'm out of it she shows up to my house with all my stuff that i left at her place  i'm thinking great i get my stuff back she pops open a bottle of pills takes them right in my house  i'm like holy shit call the cops ambulance comes oh that's where you're a dummy  i just want to die leave me alone yeah that was a perfect opportunity to play a little game of 
[02:01:00]  fucking chicken she downs the pills right in front of you you're both in the house the phone's right  there really if you hang in there long enough the fucking uh the girl will pick up the phone yeah  the best part of the story guys is the cop that shows up ends up marrying her and has a wedding  on the beach so i ended up getting out of it really that wedding on the beach was supposed to be you  no uh i looked at i looked at getting married on a beach i did it is it is the biggest crock of 
[02:01:30]  shit ever because i've been lucky enough to take some caribbean vacations in the last few years yeah  yeah you know the first three quarters of my career i didn't have enough money to go down to the  fucking caribbean sure but i'm thankful that i was able to you know do a few of those and every time i  went they set up for that damn wedding and it was horrendous everyone was miserable with the sand blowing 
[02:02:00]  it can't be the humidity the sweat yeah it can't be a sand and everything  thing it looks great when you see it in movies yeah but uh realistically it's it's it's bullshit  girls trying to trudge in like heels on the sand what is that and you're sitting there all nice like  i would be sitting there at the end of the day kind of just you know it's my thing watching the  damn sun go down yeah and i got a corona right i'm just hanging man i had a nice long day of  nothingness on the beach and you watch them set up the wedding i mean i'm talking to a few people 
[02:02:30]  that have checked this shit out yeah yeah and like you said i've seen it the the bride is walking  through the sand with her high heels that almost falling over and the sun's going down and it's  still hot as balls and then the sun goes down now everyone's getting bit by mosquitoes  a total disaster there's always some kind of breeze so the the veil is blowing so they can't get the  pictures right i watch it going out every time like god damn thank god i was able to see a few of 
[02:03:00]  these in action yeah they really do uh uh make it try to try to make it look romantic and everyone  has to sit in chairs on the beach and they can't get that properly like oh yeah you're rocking back  and forth yeah well they'll try to put a wood platform oh yeah they've down which just doesn't  work yeah no no i've seen the whole uh display blow over because you get some nice winds happening  right before the wedding that's funny uh all right vince i guess that's it for you  all right hey thanks guys take care all right let me go vincent let's go to greg in dc greg 
[02:03:30]  hi greg good morning boys how are you greg i'm uh yeah i wanted to call and let you know i was dating  a girl who uh towards the end of our relationship went a little stupid on me and i had her on speaker  phone because it was kind of funny listening to her go off about how depressed she'd be if she was  without me and uh she says you know if you ever leave me i'm just gonna kill myself and i'm like  what are you gonna do she goes i'm gonna slice my wrist and a friend of mine who's in the room 
[02:04:00]  laughing his ass off the whole time as quietly as he could pipes in and goes well bring me the knife  i'll sharpen it for you you need to run the blade from wrist to elbow it helps to get the blood out  quicker okay so he was giving her uh lessons on how to do it the real way yeah that's the real  suicide by uh you know slicing yourself yeah not the the quick across the wrist the fake one yeah  needless to say uh unfortunately well i can't say unfortunately that's really just talking to people 
[02:04:30]  she did not kill herself you know but she did break up with me you know now that we're discussing  this i i wouldn't mind if one of my exes killed themselves then i'd feel like i was really  a truly truly a good catch like a real yes true it's like a better catch though if they went gay  because they could find a better man yeah  it would be nice to like all sudden someone you know somebody from my my past writes me that knew my 
[02:05:00]  ex or something said oh you hear what happened to to blank blah blah blah i'm like really wow i must  have been i must have been a catch after all yeah i was a catch she killed herself because you do  believe you know they can't live without you and then you hear about your exes oh this one's  up to her fifth kid and happily married for 20 years or whatever and doing everything you're like  what then what happened but i remember when we broke up you couldn't live without me she was supposed 
[02:05:30]  to kill herself yeah i feel like how about one of you old fucking broads i used to go out with kill  yourself it's bad for my self-esteem right she was supposed to do herself in i need a a pump up in  my self-esteem uh let's go to bonnie in dc bonnie bonnie hey hi bonnie hey i wanted to tell you that i  had a boyfriend who the whole relationship eight months said he was going to kill himself if i left  him but i left him he got together with my best friend had two kids and um she left him and he blew his

[02:07:00]  it was freaking perfect like the weather report yeah that's a good one so you're saying the weather  was great they're saying that danny's got some wedding picture fails and there's one with a  bride tipping over and you just see her fucking ass why is that a fail hanging out that is  can someone explain why that's a fail win wow that's a win that is great nice ass his ass on 
[02:07:30]  that bright look at that ease the wedding bill bill bill burr was saying it like just he doesn't want  to get married because of the embarrassment of the wedding itself like he he doesn't want to be that  guy standing up the center of attention for the day with all the well the usual pomp and circumstance i mean  you know a guy that went through a relatively recent yeah you realize it's not about you  it's really her day it's her day you're just kind of you know what then can i stay home and watch tv 
[02:08:00]  kind of a spectator i mean you know they just they just give you a talk i mean their dress thing is a  whole fucking thing it's too busy it's like oh god it's they it takes them forever to do forever to  pick out a dress and all you have to do is go to a tuxedo store rent something and within an hour  you're good to go for your own wedding you're in a tux that somebody else had their wedding in but  the bride it's all about oh we got to go to this store and this place might be having a sale and  this uh the flowers i hear there might be a a vera wang somewhere that oh five other uh brides war and 
[02:08:30]  maybe we could get that and and redesign that and it's a whole thing and you just sit up there with  your talks and you just take it all in and and you're a spectator you're watching just wait wait  till it's over just wait till it's over go to the fucking uh go to your honeymoon do some of that  fucking fucking and socking walking socking let's go to sean in indiana sean 
[02:09:00]  what's up oh hey man uh by the way the ratings are in on bill from connecticut's phone call and it  was a massive fail bill wow still listening wow massive yeah completely i can top bill all right  let's hear it sean i went and got married in jamaica very good whatever i wanted to sneak some  uh jamaican funk back with me and smoke a big cone with my friend so i hollowed out my left shoe  rapid triple back yeah they haven't seen that one yeah that's the airport that's a brand new gimmick 
[02:09:30]  the old hollowed out shoe gag jesus got busted dog right off the fucking plane dude got my wife won  eight hundred dollars in a slot machine in jamaica that was my fail to get me out that night and  fucking an atlanta jail you're lucky you won by u.s customs that's scary man i you know i when we used  to go to turks and caicos you know we would smoke some of those cuban cigars and you start thinking like 
[02:10:00]  you know what i wouldn't mind having a few of these back in the states yeah and you start  thinking i'm so paranoid and i got so paranoid i'm like i'm thinking what's the worst they would  do at the airport you go oh fuck i didn't realize that's what i thought you're talking pot which is  a lot worse than a cuban cigar i mean i know they frown on the cuban cigars but not as much as the pot  yeah the cigars aren't illegal it's like transporting them into the u.s where can i put one can i put one in  like a toothbrush holder or you you start thinking all this stuff yeah and then and then the fear and 
[02:10:30]  the anxiety that it takes over like i can't fucking even i'm not smuggling these hell no i wasn't going  with the ass but this fucking guy's hollowing out his shoe yeah well hey man that trick never works  you know you're you're a better man than me that you're you know you're willing to give it a shot  that's all i'm saying well i hear you but we're divorced now anyway so it didn't work 
[02:11:00]  all right well now i i think even the the people that get divorced the wedding worked  for a while you know what i mean i mean mine was thrown mine was a thrown together  white trash wedding i've talked about it enough times here so it like it didn't have all that  i think you're in circumstance and circumstance yes i think you're the only  i had the pomp and circumstance and it didn't work anyway so i'm you know i'm on top of it out  whatever ten fifteen thousand dollars yeah i think you're the only one i've met that 
[02:11:30]  admits that um they knew it was a mistake as they were getting married oh yeah yeah i think you're the  only person i've come across before during and after i've had other people that go yeah early on i  realized oh fuck what did i do but you're i think the only person i've ever met where you basically  knew as long as you were doing it before during and after i knew it was a giant mistake just horrid 
[02:12:00]  but it goes have a good weekend but it goes back to what you and i have in common where  we realize we make a mistake and then we just hang in there hang in there  whatever hang in there just find a distraction or something else to do which we have the show thank god  yeah thank god we had the fucking radio show because that marriage i was in i don't know what  i would have done see i'm not even gonna lie to you man i i i get so mad because i mean the the young 
[02:12:30]  broads that were fucking throwing themselves at us in boston and we were just nice guys what  the flinging flinging yeah the most i did i think was just not saying i got with not saying i didn't get  a taste every once in a while a couple all right we took a few liberties with some of the females  i say we didn't a few liberty saying we didn't dip it every once in a while but we were good guys  god damn it good i mean the most i ever did was like you know cheesy making out yeah with some girl 
[02:13:00]  with braces yeah she was a kalua girl though so it was legit like she was of age  we should have fucking gone that night dude i will regret that is that is my my one regret  you know how people always say i have no regrets in life i lived my life i made mistakes i did i have  a regret and it's that me and opie did not fuck the shit out of the kalua girl from club cadillac 
[02:13:30]  yeah because we even know the place i i remember the music on the radio as i was leaving going  i remember walking through the restaurant to get to the back just to party was it  kalua girls or bud girls though we always make that mistake uh i think it was the kalua girls yeah  yeah because i think there were bud girls there too and they were uh but girls were a little snobbier  the kalua girls were goers yeah they were and and wanted to go we actually said no to a skinny  dipping party holy shit what the fuck is wrong with us i grabbed one of them and just started 
[02:14:00]  fucking sucking face behind some billboard and then uh and then the other ones come out and and  they're asking us you want to you want to go skinny dipping we know a great place to just we'll take  our clothes off and go swimming i was paranoid that i was paranoid my girl would smell uh  pussy on my fingers when i got home oh god i i i like now you think back though who cares yeah  it's pussy you got a problem i i was paranoid i i figured wow how am i going to explain that i'm 
[02:14:30]  kind of smelling like a goddamn pond right now deep because we would have had it done the skinny  dipping part we'd have been all wet i know that's the whole thing was there was no viable explanation  we couldn't come up with an excuse why would you smell like swamp water you remember getting into  the car though and and we shut the doors and we're like that was a good gig those yeah and all we're 
[02:15:00]  thinking is like fuck ah this ah fuck i felt like that asshole kid in fast times at ridgemont high  yeah it's fucking turning away from jennifer jason lee's window and then you know a fucking rat he  walks out the door wait wait i'm wait wait wait when he when he took her home and they're sitting  on the bed and she's in her robe oh right right and looking at the photo album yeah yeah yeah and  she goes to kiss him and he goes oh i gotta get my sister's car home it's like then he walks out  and then he gets that moment where it's like maybe i should and he turns around and her light shuts out 
[02:15:30]  and he knows it's just he missed his moment that mean you missed the moment knock on that door and  that light will go right back on that fucking snatch would be wide open for you a fucking loose  slut but that that's how i felt it was like we're driving away and i'm just thinking like can we  turn around is there uh we should we should have blown it up right there but right there then i think  our radio show would have been shit why because then we would have just been fucking everything  maybe we made the right decision i don't know man i don't know i i just have a uh that that is a 
[02:16:00]  regret how bad do you want to go get a time machine and go back and strangle our old selves i want to  fucking be sitting in the back seat of the car when we get in the front seat yeah and just  fucking pull a fucking carlo on me with a piano wire yeah what are you doing asshole what the  fuck is wrong what are you doing get out there and fucking do you want to see something and i'd have  some paperwork with me like some files from a divorce case yeah and i'd be like look look at 
[02:16:30]  this look at this see here's what your future holds yeah so why don't you go right now and do the  right thing do the right thing and get in that lake with that girl go now we'll wait here no but  it's like bill and ted talking about the princesses yeah exactly but no the old version of me had to  be the enabling douche i'd pop you're worried about everybody else except himself i'd pop your hood and  pull the distributor out you motherfuckers aren't going anywhere until you get in the lake with those 
[02:17:00]  girls and i remember they're like what do you mean no what what they're like what do you mean  no not imagine you guys are heading toward middle age and we're young supple fucking barely 20 year  olds what's wrong with you happy i know we must have fucked their self-esteem up really bad  it's like why don't these guys and they probably turned around and said i bet they're gay  i bet they're gay if i was a chick in that situation i would have to think that why wouldn't we 
[02:17:30]  fucking why wouldn't we go and fucking swim naked with those girls i do remember me and you were  looking at each other like we were trying to figure it out we're like all right we're we both know each  other's not that happy yeah it's like how the fuck do we do how are we gonna do this oh we should  have just done it and dealt with the consequences we gotta get in we got we got all right the clothes  have come off so the clothes won't be wet but we'll we have no towels where our hair would be wet with 
[02:18:00]  like fucking massachusetts pond water right you know what i would have done i would have drove my car  into a fucking lake on the way home after this i barely escaped we barely made it out alive  holy shit i would have just sacrificed my car and they'd both be going oh sweetie i'm so glad  you're okay we got a nice hot meal when we don't touch me i smell like lake water wow were there trout  in that uh pond no no yeah yeah i mean yeah plenty of fish jumped right in our you know damn on our 
[02:18:30]  penises you know damn well i would have sacrificed my fucking car yeah just driving in the lake anthony i  have one way we can do this how i'm gonna drive my car into the lake all right hope i'm with you  right we got a good story that one works yep you know that's absolutely making sense to me right now  what like that would have worked the car thing yeah i'm not even i'm i'm serious too my car  my car wasn't that great what the fuck the fuck you got a new one the insurance would have paid for it 
[02:19:00]  it would have been insurance fraud but you know you know i think they would understood you tell your  girlfriends you drove the car into a lake yeah and you have you're with the girls in the lake you get  to have some sex you tell the insurance company they get you a new car kevin from connectica is  ridiculous he writes i know offense kevin because i mean you contribute a lot but this is just silly  oh did you both know that neither one of you would not write out the other one yeah oh that was 
[02:19:30]  question that was the last fucking worry there was no worry i was already taking care of by just  looking at it and like we weren't gonna fucking say shit we were both in the same miserable boat  and uh we had opportunities that we didn't capitalize on because we didn't want to screw up our  relationships that were already screwed up great great fucking minds think alike kevin writes we did  a remote from chapel uh what was it chappaquiddick oh chappaquiddick and we fucking drove into a 
[02:20:00]  lake how bad though is like we go skinny dipping we have like what everyone's imagining then we do the  lake trick and then one of us dies now the story falls apart because the authorities are like it's  like where were you i was just well the time frame doesn't work out where were you between this hour and  this and then they talk to witnesses and oh no i'm not talking about the girls you know just uh  well that's what i'm talking about like one of us then we'd have to fess up with the fact that 
[02:20:30]  yeah we were skinny dipping with some girls and we planned on driving into the lake  i didn't know anthony couldn't swim yeah yeah yeah yeah but they're like all right you guys are getting  out of here in a half hour uh you know we're gonna go they literally go we're gonna go skinny dipping  yeah yeah like they threw that out there like it's a no-brainer and those bright eyes they were  all like bright eyed and blinking and going you want to go like all excited knowing dude knowing we 
[02:21:00]  were saying yes right they were knowing we were going to say yes and we were pretty like we were  pretty damn popular no no we gotta we really gotta go because we got like things to do we want didn't  want to say we had chicks to go home to so it was like we got like things to do yeah it's  fucking 11 30 at night or something like that we got things do we don't have to be to work till  three in the afternoon the next day i i went home i uh rolled over i looked out the window it was a 
[02:21:30]  full moon and i'm thinking oh just fucking a full moon skinny dipping and then as i was falling asleep  just one tear a single tear a single tear was just dripping down my face to me to me more in ghost  as i'm just staring into the distance out the window of what could have been i remember crawling into bed  and hearing so how'd it go you're like great and i'm i just looked over i did the right thing i  looked over and just i think i literally went yuck i think it was audible i i threw out an audible 
[02:22:00]  yuck and but you knew you only had five years to go only five more years in my sentence right that's  all i had holy shit oh assholes yeah wow okay um wow why the fuck i'm grateful shoulda  coulda woulda shoulda that skinny dipping story comes up so much it's just uh it was the perfect 
[02:22:30]  moment that we just let go we let it get away from us for no reason for no reason because we didn't  know what the future held god damn it damn it damn it all these girls are 62 years old i know  i'm trying to even think what year that was so yeah we didn't uh 95 to 98 up there i guess some  something like that so i wound up seeing it was kind of early on it was 97 i would guess so yeah 
[02:23:00]  so that's 13 years ago holy shit so there's like god they're 20 i think they were barely legal or  just under so they're like wow 33 years old yeah yeah yeah probably all cracked out can only hope  and shit can only hope that there's a disaster that we you know passed up um i saw one of the  one of those girls uh later on at uh like not later on that day but like a couple of months later 
[02:23:30]  in framingham at another gig at ebenezer's oh really hanging out yeah yeah just hanging out  and she was like she came up she's like oh hi hi and and the wife is like who the  fuck is that well that was the fucking girl that was the fucking girl i didn't fuck right in a lake  after skinny dipping yeah because i had to go home to how to go  sometimes i think you gotta do it just do it and then see what happens guys just do it i'm thinking 
[02:24:00]  now i'm thinking because you know what if you want to that bad there's a problem now i got time to  think it over i'm like well what what the fuck did i really do that day yeah i would have sped some  things along i'm thinking if i came home dripping absolutely dripping wet of fucking disgusting  massachusetts pond water and and fucking just sex the smell of sex a fish just falling out of my  cheek to the floor glitter makeup on your fucking lower abdomen 
[02:24:30]  all right you know it's not nice to call us homos ah that's really not nice you  fucking homos that's really a lot of fags coming in i know you guys are homos yeah we're homos we  didn't have to fucking share with you fuckers steve from bay show says come home with leeches on your  sack from that fucking pond leeches  uh no all right the leech was in bed when i got home there wasn't one on my sack 
[02:25:00]  i hope you know that's one of them it's one of those fish that got away yep well all right let's uh  we'll always have the rock bus all right so maybe there's all right you know come on i didn't touch  no there were a couple of you know could have been described as indiscretions but you remember  never never going the distance remember the one girl's boobs oh how could i forget oh my 
[02:25:30]  fucking how could i forget didn't we fucking and where did we put the bullseye oh yeah you remember  the bullseye yeah that was right on you came up with some fucking brilliant way to get her take  her fucking clothes off no but we were we drawing bullseyes on her boobs yeah with a sharpie and we  were drawn all over her you came up with this idea and they went for like oh okay this makes sense  yeah it was two girls in the rock bus they decided they would you know would take their clothes off 
[02:26:00]  and then we just started drawing on them with sharpie markers and then you got the one to do a  headstand yeah i was like could you do a headstand and spread your legs yeah yeah yes yes i forgot  about that could you do a headstand and spread your legs i'm like this anthony's a weirdo okay that's  normal yeah we'd only known each other like a year or so it was like yeah no this is how i roll this is  normal this is how i roll oh i want to see her do a headstand oh god yeah yeah 
[02:26:30]  yeah oh oh we're on the radio uh let's say hi to dave and albuquerque dave dave hey man how you  guys doing well what do you think i got one for you my uh my ex-wife uh got divorced probably about  four or five years ago about two years ago up and killed herself i was with this girl for almost 
[02:27:00]  nine years and uh one day one of my buddies calls me up says man i don't know how to tell this to you  but uh well well so and so is dead man i kind of kept my mouth shut and started going  oh that god jesus the only regret i have is that i didn't get to watch 
[02:27:30]  ah poor guy i don't i don't understand why i don't understand why the news doesn't really uh take on  this angle but when we get these major disasters you could pick your favorite disaster of the last few  years yeah uh you know there's people dying in those situations where where it's making someone  extremely happy that they're finally out of a situation yeah but no one ever brings that up  no one brings that up because all victims of a disaster were really good people and it's such 
[02:28:00]  a tragic loss and this and that and man i just know i mean the odds dictate that there's a few people  at home going hold what they're basically saying i think there really is a god i'm going to start  going to church every sunday for this miracle this guy gave me right exactly oh yeah all right all right  man you know you're sitting there like imagine i mean no i don't want to i'm not going to go that way 
[02:28:30]  but just imagine you're in uh you know a divorce that take taking forever and you're like i'm in hell i  don't know how i'm this i'm i can't believe and then all of a sudden a tsunami takes her out or  something but she's on vacation with your money i think if if you're in a horrible situation yeah  that you wouldn't feel good about it i think there'd be like a a very i'm talking about bad thing i'm  talking about real like war of the roses type battle i don't want people to be confused i'm talking  about real horrible people yeah yeah horrible people yeah how about we go with this i'm sure 
[02:29:00]  in some of these disasters kid touchers are being killed oh yeah you think when fucking thailand or  whatever it was it got slammed by a tsunami it wasn't a bunch of fucking kid touchers kid touching went  uh down drastically after that tsunami you gotta think yeah you gotta not everybody not everybody is  like fucking great when they die in a disaster you think in some of those tsunami areas they're like 
[02:29:30]  a strange thing has happened uh kid touching is down 75 percent the last couple years a bunch of  healthy uh minded children being raised now have no baggage what's going on scratching their heads  like wow what is this about we're gonna have to look into these stats fascinating all right dr steve's  gonna call in good to go he's finally done with his fatherly duties yes that comes first and he's  ready to talk to us about uh cory haimes uh death right he's gonna talk about uh mixing some of  these drugs uh vicodin and i think soma are uh a couple drugs i think they're looking at not allowed 
[02:30:00]  to mix those eh no i don't know that vicodin i just took it for like my my fucking tooth when i had  a toothache years ago and uh i gotta say that's a damn good buzz makes your head itchy make that  shit makes you itch like i eat it i eat that shit i keep all that stuff out of my house because i know  i'd be one of those guys yeah i think so i like the buzz but then once the fucking once the bottle's 
[02:30:30]  gone it's like oh fuck yeah but well then yeah but then other people like fuck the bottle's gone now  watch now what i gotta do get more yeah all right uh why was norton swept away no he's in chicago  that's funny it was a tsunami that just reached his seat and then pulled back out to the beach  holy shit oh this guy he asks uh how come you're always remembering old girly stories instead of 
[02:31:00]  creating new ones i i oh interesting i've created my share of new stories yeah but i mean at the time  i was i was like in a relationship thinking i was doing the right thing and you know what it was yeah  first of all i was in a relationship that i really didn't want to be in uh so looking back in hindsight i i  think oh fuck i could have done this that or the other thing and have the same end result of not being 
[02:31:30]  married anymore right right uh nowadays it's kind of a different thing or at least that my my last  relationship was you know it was very good relationship with a very cool girl right and  shit and i wasn't fucking around uh on her i have no regrets that i didn't grab any side  pussy during that relationship because yeah uh you know because she was cool and everything i'm happy right  now so it's like i mean i know it wasn't happy at the times yeah that's why it makes it very uh 
[02:32:00]  like oh what the fuck was i thinking shit you know what i mean and i have new fun stories the whole  fucking summer of jill was the fun interesting little radio soap opera and uh you know the closet  story and yes kevin jumps right in are you fucking kidding me jill nicolini was a great story  of yeah of course there's there's new stories but obi's married he's not gonna you know  no i have any new stories no i mean i had time i had time where yeah i created in between i 
[02:32:30]  created fucking new stories and all but i'm just in a different place now i knew i wasn't happy and  i'm like but i'm gonna do the right thing but why but you know what it's that that that stems from how  i was grown up where you it's all about taking care taking care don't worry about you taking care  take care take care of this but you're not worried about your happiness your new stories from in  in between relationships is you being single that's not we're not he's sitting here bragging  about our our fucking sex exploits while we're single this was we were in relationships and we 
[02:33:00]  didn't want to have a regret because you you didn't take the opportunity it's a totally different  situation then we knew it see we knew at the time we were in bad relationships that's what's key to  this whole right thing right like if i easy to it would have been easy to do i felt like i was in a  really good relationship at the time then believe it or not the skinny dipping thing wouldn't have  been that big of a deal to me yeah you know what i'm trying to say it's yeah you still think as a guy 
[02:33:30]  like oh that would be cool of course but what makes this really really like a regret is knowing that  i'm in a relationship that's going nowhere and i have these opportunities so it's like what am i  doing i could be doing this type of thing yeah that's uh the the point of the whole thing was  we were in shitty relationships we knew it and we didn't make a move on it and that was the regret  part right he's talking about something different right there's no right now there's no you know 
[02:34:00]  making a move that's fucking anything up that we know is a bad situation like none of that's just  going on so no no it's not as it's not we're not just sitting here trying to brag about uh uh you  know what we could do with girls right it's not the point no i'm just in a different place right now  yeah i'm completely fine back then you are and i mean and and the station we worked for was all just  fucking it was just it was young snatch everywhere we looked we they would send us out to concerts

[02:39:00]  well just let it go i do there's a whole traffic thing on that channel in regards to this man  right here yeah oh that's right that's why you guys told me that before mc foley set that one up  yeah yeah i might want to thank him i was on cw 11 uh like two weeks ago yeah it was at st patrick's  day yeah and they uh they cut to her live in the street but no one was in the street yet and she  just looked like the last person on earth like like i am legend yeah with a stupid hat on drunken legend 
[02:39:30]  in just seven hours the place is gonna be packed it's gonna be off the hook stop talking like that  you're not a ricky lake dummy  yeah what's it like to not get cut out of a movie john oh wow you're the big star of the movie it's uh  it's fulfilling should i should i turn the question around and ask what it's like to be cut out of a  movie to you that's wonderful it'll make you do a sitcom right on okay where'd you get cut out of 
[02:40:00]  street kings i was up to 215 pounds i was like a mysterio brother for crying out loud  and uh there's like entire scenes of me and keanu talking and it's just from over my shoulder to his  his gorgeous face gone all gone it's yeah oh who knows because it's you know do you want to show  this guy with his porn star mustache that looks like carrie collins or do you want keanu reeves  maybe maybe i'm not as good as i think i am 
[02:40:30]  you know what i got you know what i got uh just last night to pop into my uh kaleidoscape player down  there in the theater i got go and i got suicide kings didn't get cut out of those two no you did not  get cut out of those that's back when i had heat that was uh suicide king those are two of my  effing those are two great fucking movies go is hysterical if i can love that movie and suicide  kings you know it's great what about the marine god damn the marine yes i don't want to put that  on front street but that's probably the best film in the history of cinematography of any film do you 
[02:41:00]  have any john cena movies in your in your uh system uh yes as a matter of fact the marine yeah yeah  that's the one and only that's that's the only one that's so soon to have two so far it's going  under the cena collection i'll get you the bootleg that is starting oh i got it already all right  right now pay for it hey uh john's in the paper today too what are you doing yeah i made the news  i guess a little mad at uh a-rod and the steroid thing yeah well a lot of people see you and they  go he had to be on steroids my goodness and i know you haven't i mean you've said it a million times 
[02:41:30]  come on you did something come on a little bit a little bit a little bit a little bit and of  course the uh one day real rain is gonna come john don't get nervous don't get nervous but uh  my party though once again the media kind of take me out of context it's not necessarily i was mad  at a-rod i just think uh you know all these guys are getting caught or busted for uh substance  abuse or performance enhancing drugs this is not just started with a-rod or barry bonds or whomever 
[02:42:00]  this has been going on for quite some time and the thing the drugs are illegal and i think the  athletes take these chances because there really is virtually no penalty a-rod's still playing get  still getting paid no bonds had a great career off it all these guys are still doing what they're  doing if you took the penalty and let pretty much the government get involved and send these guys  to jail then they're sacrificing contract money they're sacrificing sponsorship money and they have  a criminal going to jail and going to jail you know the the drugs are illegal so i'm gonna lock 
[02:42:30]  up our baseball players well if if if they're essentially quote unquote cheating and breaking  the law you know it obviously would make that choice a little bit more but it's america difficult  is it against the law to actually do steroids yeah they're they're actually banned they're they're  again it's against the law but we're the only country that bans them like you can go to  europe you go to europe the eastern block like madonna and everybody gets their hgh yeah yeah and  like they go to the clubs the trench coat selling it yeah hgh is like a big thing in europe that's  why nobody's dying over there anymore yeah we we do i mean we we have a little bit of a skewed 
[02:43:00]  system over here but that's the law and i think uh if people are going to make such a big deal out  of it especially bringing these guys in front of congress and and having these hearings and spending  taxpayer money on this stuff they're not doing anything about it they're letting the governing body  even in the case of the wwe we sanction ourselves it's uh suspension suspension and termination  so it's one of those yeah it's one of those things where if the if the government was so up in  arms about it they should just they should get involved from a legal standpoint and that's that's  my two cents i like that uh strongman competition when the those jacked up guys can't hurt the terror 
[02:43:30]  hurts the first of kerkin furkin loves me some strong ferkin hurt yeah you like taking ship anchors  and throw them through a third story window and no one knows why why it's the best why don't we  just bench like the combine how many times can you heft 225 pounds they're not going to be pulling  you do it once pulling 767s with their teeth that's my max gentlemen they're right free just like you 
[02:44:00]  guys yeah hold back a b52 with your fingertips a 767 hundred yard dash like why like why yeah those  guys are all like jacked on some juice i stop and watch every time though oh oh yeah it's a great  announcer it's like oh this guy's got everything it takes yeah he's putting needles in his ass on the  way down to the finish line you can see zits popping on his back as he's trying to push some 
[02:44:30]  fucking boulder the faster his heartbeats the zits pop themselves  like a wet gremlin you definitely want to be first one in that you ever see the one where they take  the tractor uh tires yeah like they're literally as high as the ceiling and they got to like knock  them end over end not roll them making those phases not roll yeah there's one guy just turn it 
[02:45:00]  sideways and roll the thing down the fucking hill yeah watch go done five seconds done for me face  but yo you you like the red bull though yeah i uh they just laid down a red bull and a muscle milk  right in front of me and that's uh that's a pretty decent breakfast right there what is a muscle  bell call about it's uh just like a donkey cum he doesn't care though he's a man standard mirror  placement from the from the semen of jungle animals find any drugstore you know it is it's uh it 
[02:45:30]  typically is vanilla flavor yeah it's more it's frog when you get into it yeah look at the size of  cena's hands my god i know you're a large guy just crush your hand outside i was like mr cena  she turned into an instant instant bitch when you shake john cena's hand i'm mr cena  so guys what else is up what's going on i don't know we just we just sit here on a daily basis and  babble about things i want to hear more about the movie though what uh who's who else is in it with

[03:08:00]  like what twice a year once a year how'd he get that contract i know he did once i know he i know  he came on once and he gave a shout out like two weeks ago like one little quick shout out really  to you no some other like show we have on on our channel like it's very big like he's got his own  channel on sirius xm it's like his deal is i think he has to do what did you tell us eight hours a year  or something yeah like eight hours he has to do eight hours eight hours a year that's it that's amazing man  that's amazing that's like uh that's real fame right there yeah we have to be here every 
[03:08:30]  fucking day we're the workhorses that's like when richie leave early like what the  fuck you see the deals you guys make around here give us some slack just sign rosie o'donnell for  some ridiculous deal she doesn't even have to come in the building get out of here the deal that uh  they get the deal that uh like ron howard got when he left happy days so like just show up whenever  we'd be happy to have you yeah we'll make you believe you're in paris just just film your scenes 
[03:09:00]  on the phone like you're talking to them back home we'll shove these other people out of the  way anytime you want to come back they took off 10 minutes off his eight hours for that shout out i  was like oh really that's incredible you know so that's right so he did another 10 minutes jesus christ  i was telling who kid i've been listening to his show you're on saturdays mostly yeah saturdays from  10 a.m to 5 p.m you do a marathon show like you know you i mean you're here every day  but i'd do like a deaf day like that's kind of cool though i wouldn't mind like getting it all  out of the way in one show like that no your fans want to hear you every day my fans they smoke weed 
[03:09:30]  every saturday and drugs yeah they're off well i was listening because you you get sam on the show  and uh there was a porn star listen to this one joe and i'm glad he's here because i couldn't figure  it out she's a virgin yeah she's a porn star virgin that takes it in the ass now wrap your mind around  that i've wrapped it around that's fucked up yeah what uh so she thinks she's still a virgin because  she only takes it in the back door but then i was asking who kid and he didn't answer me because then 
[03:10:00]  we had to get on the air like yeah but she's got to be like not a virgin in real life dude she's just  a virgin in the porn world well she's stated that she's a vaginal virgin she only does anal  she's waiting she's waiting for her husband to come like oh yeah she's a good girl she's got  ethics and morals she's not even she's not even arab like i don't understand i was just gonna say that  i'm half arab and arab girls do that a lot of arab girls only take it in the back because they say 
[03:10:30]  that makes them a virgin i mean what yeah if you go to dubai or like abu dhabi or anywhere like where  you know the muslim world where you can't fuck their daughters i'm sure you know that wait so you're  allowed to fuck them in the ass americans like they allow americans to fuck them in the ass  well that's what the girl i mean you're not allowed to the dad doesn't go fuck her in the ass whatever  but that's the way the girls justify that's how they look at like as long as i keep the the vagina  it's so it's ass backwards no pun intended i didn't even mean that to be that just popped out that's 
[03:11:00]  terrible yeah but sam turned me on to who kids show and i'm sorry i gotta admit i'm a fan now i'm  listening uh on saturdays i do a lot of driving on saturdays okay especially when you're in traffic  it's good it's good to listen to you know you like that you like you love that gunshot on your show  yeah i gotta keep it murderous man you know 50 cent is my boss too so it's you know we invited him in  because he hung out with michael jackson that's where we start but then we're gonna go in a bunch of 
[03:11:30]  different areas in the arab countries i was in bahrain isn't that kind of crazy so when he was hiding over  there you were there too for a little while yeah i was paid by the the the chic uh al-calif for the  one that's suing him right for leaving his label he he put michael jackson up and but he was assuming  michael was gonna do some shows or something for him right no he was uh michael jackson was supposed  to uh produce three albums for him for his for his label really and he was gonna tour all over like  the arab world and europe and michael jackson used him good yeah he had no intention of making any 
[03:12:00]  albums for this guy bought him a palace gave him like a couple million dollars you know michael  michael and he hung out there for what a year he was there for like uh well he was for a couple  months like seven to eight months i went there to dj the formula one uh racing car thing and uh  you know i lost my passport right so to fast forward my stay at the lavish hotels that you beautiful  arabs always pay for was up so the prince was like yo come you know the chic was like come hang out  my you know my palace so little do i know i mean i hope he knew that i was black but he was like yo 
[03:12:30]  come hang out you know in my palace and then michael jackson's there sipping on lemonade and all that  i was like what why you didn't tell me that what was it dude what what was it like the like when you  walked into the room and you're like oh my god that's michael jackson like what the  was that like i wanted to tackle him into the pool like i wanted to cry but he probably wanted you to do  that too but me being up meeting michael jackson think about that that's yeah 
[03:13:00]  hey by the way uh there's a debate on this show that uh muhammad ali was more famous than michael  jackson wow i think michael jackson was way more famous than muhammad ali in the end  jim norton insists no fucking way well if you go to like weird countries like kazakhstan and india  everybody knows michael jackson and and you get both sexes with michael jackson because he's you  know a music guy right yeah there's no way muhammad ali is as famous as michael jackson there is 
[03:13:30]  dude nobody i've never seen one video of people crying and feigning for muhammad i lost the debate  with jimmy i just couldn't explain why michael jackson would be more famous i mean there's one way you  could prove it just go to the schools and go to the handicapped class do you know ali and if a  handicapped person don't say that they don't say michael jackson i i say as far as the world goes  there's not many people like michael jackson as far as fame goes muhammad ali could have gotten away  with potentially banging two kids right i don't believe it for a second nobody could have pulled 
[03:14:00]  that off except michael jackson you have to have like just ridiculous fame to pull that off i mean i  i didn't bring it up when i met him because i was like kind of nervous what did he look like  i mean he looked just like the way you see him in the pictures the only thing is he emaciated in  person yeah he had white legs which is very odd yeah short was that about  he had your legs uh i don't know i don't understand you know he had your legs it's safe to say he was as 
[03:14:30]  dark as you he was right you know like darker he was actually darker than you i'm like the brownish guy  right right right but he was like black like and now he was as white as like you said my legs  like what the fuck is that he's i don't know there's some skin i didn't really bring it up the  only thing but it can't be just a skin disease it can't be he had to have some kind of bleaching done  over his whole body and is that something you could get done i mean you know we got a tan that that's 
[03:15:00]  very confusing like when i saw that just he just felt weird i felt like i was touching asbestos when i  when i get when i give him a handshake oh really oh what does hand feel like it feels like like  like scrunchy kind of i don't know like crunchy you know what my he said he had that what's that  called vitilago or whatever yeah he said that's what he had and the the common thing is that it's  spots thank you it's spots so all right if he had that then they had to like go in and bleach just  to make it all the same that's what i think he did i think he did have it and then he was like  he's such a crazy like he thinks you know he's like i'm a work of art he's like he just bleached all his 
[03:15:30]  shit so it all matched that's what i think i mean i know people that have that they got they take  they have makeup and they they cover it and you know i don't know but the police thing is kind of  ridiculous covering your legs i mean if you have a couple weird spots on your face maybe you're  blending everything to make it look like something but you're not gonna bother with your big white  head and brown legs it's gonna look ridiculous it looks like a cream-filled tootsie roll and you think  you think you'd have a tan wearing like the desert it's like 130 degrees out there like i was hiding in the 
[03:16:00]  hotel like i was black as did you get to hang with him at all or was it more of just meeting  him real fast nah it was supposed to be like a quick meeting because he came over to hang out  with the chic and talk business and then he was gonna just leave right but i guess he heard my  stupidity and jokes while i was fooling around with the princess and stuff so he decided to stay  and have a dinner and the chic was so happy so he invited like everybody else john legend came through uh  tyson bergford you know the the crazy model and they all came and then it was just history he was 
[03:16:30]  just hanging with us cursing he's he curses curses like motherfucker get the fuck i was like what  like it was like and he has that weird high voice super high voice it was like crazy i told him it was  it was when they were taking neverland from him he was like that place man really i was like mike  that's your place i said they're about to get rid of all the mexican workers you have there and all  that fuck that what the fuck about that i was like oh shit mike yo wow that's where your tilt-a-whirl  is it was very odd yo it was we we ate lamb ass with the with the chic it was incredible i'm sure mike 
[03:17:00]  loves lamb ass it was great oh it's good if you eat it with two fingers in it first  Michael jackson enjoying some lamb ass of course and the weird thing is he brought up eminem who who  bashed him for the last like eminem's career like videos is him stepping on his nose oh right right  right i forgot about all that yeah and the first thing he was mad because eminem was in retirement 
[03:17:30]  i was like huh like it was very odd that he just he cared about eminem's retirement right and then i  put him on the phone with 50 who was doing a movie with samuel jackson in morocco right and they they  spoke about whatever and then all of a sudden 50 gets on the phone and gave me a big fuck you  why because i guess because i met michael jackson before him oh okay ah so it was like kind of weird  was he just a weird dude he was actually cool he was i guess he got tired of like lawyers and  promoters and managers talking to him like he's a little kid right finally some black dudes came 
[03:18:00]  to a palace in bahrain to hang with him which was very weird and it we just talked to him like a  regular dude was he sipping the wine or drink you know any pill in or nah it was cool he had like uh  it's like some ill book with a skull on it though he had like this this book with a skull i thought  it was like some illuminati thing but i didn't really question like i don't know he didn't want  me to see it he had it like between his hand if you look at the photos all the michael jackson photos  is on it oh i gotta see something it's out of control what do you mean it's a book with a skull on it 
[03:18:30]  yeah like a skull with like i don't know it's like weird like diamonds on the skull or something was it a  regular book then that was just the cover it was a book with a cover but me and my boy was like  you think it might have been hollow and had some stuff in there hey yipes  i don't know it was very very odd yo i mean he was a cool dude man i was shocked i thought he was  gonna be timid i thought he was gonna be walling out you know like he wasn't spacey or out of it  or nah he was just talking his ass off what do you think they're gonna find you think they're gonna  find out he was a true hardcore junkie or i mean i was just looking at the papers today they say yeah 
[03:19:00]  they found pills in his ass or something like that like was in his ass or stomach in the stomach  oh okay all right that's a little different okay wow there you are with yeah michael jackson look how  white he is yo jesus and and that's uh a wig obviously they said uh they found out through the  autopsy he had no hair left oh for real he pretty much had no hair that freaks me out get out of here  that part freaked me out did you predict this my no when i got the uh actually someone uh texted 
[03:19:30]  me i was like get the fuck out you know you get those texts every once in a while like get the  fuck out but i heard you're doing all the predictions man oh well i i predicted that 2009 would be the  year of the celebrity death and so far it's been really good damn man keep putting my wife on that  the guy with the turban is that the guy whose pals it is yeah that's him because it literally  looks like a dude just went to halloween adventure it looks like some puerto rican 
[03:20:00]  guy went to halloween adventure it looks like the fakest sheet i've ever seen in my life what is  he worth billions of dollars yo he is worth like ridiculous stupid money this guy this guy had a  gold audi with a gold engine so he's suing michael he doesn't he could give a shit about well was uh  he could give a shit about the money he was just pissed off that yeah the deal didn't go through  michael did him wrong but michael's been doing those deals for years like you see he did that  50 that big 50 show date sold out right and now what are they gonna do and there's no refund i heard 
[03:20:30]  can't get no refund for those 50 shows so so that money is made somebody either he's still alive with  tupac or yeah right or he's really dead you really think tupac's alive that's what i heard  somebody said he was on twitter did you see that did you see that tmz thing did you guys see the tmz  sighting of tupac no way they had a picture they had pictures i swear to god they had photos of two of a  guy it was tupac and the guy goes the guy goes look it was last week because the miller can like it 
[03:21:00]  was some there was a miller can somebody was drinking out of it was like the new miller can  no way so that you could they could prove that it was within the last few months dude it holy  shit dude that's fucking tupac man what he even got the earring and the nose ring and all that man  that could just be someone that looks like him come on opie that looks so much like i really believe  that wow eventually a celebrity will pull off the fake death thing jesus i i really believe someone 
[03:21:30]  will do that eventually but i don't think it's been done yet there it is it's more like kobe  bryant than tupac a little more kobe in that guy's face than tupac i know somebody that will  probably like i would predict will be the next to do that like he will fake his death that would be  wesley snipes for his taxes and all that like definitely wesley snipes he would have to do it  it was like fucking 22 million or something like that taxes well if he did that maybe that guy kind  of looked like him it is frustrating that you know tupac new tupac music like 200 songs 
[03:22:00]  like 200 like eight 30 albums out because that's the thing dude when biggie died that  stopped all the posthumous biggie albums are all cut together you can hear this from like 12 years  ago and shit oh so that's why you're saying tupac tupac just sounds crisp and fresh every time  not one recycled verse nothing dude i mean biggie's stuff is like you're like oh that's you can tell he's 
[03:22:30]  like 17 and that's why they dug that verse out of some you know what i mean i i'm obviously not a  huge hip-hop guy but when you hear biggie smalls every time you hear a fucking song by him you're  like god damn i gotta listen to this whole thing yeah he's awesome about i just can't believe he died  like that but the thing is crazy like did he abuse them so much like they they remixed like the songs  like there's like songs with bow wow and emmanuel lewis is on the record like everybody's doing biggie now  dude the last one the fucking the the one where it's like the painting of him on the cover the 
[03:23:00]  final one they put out the duets whatever the first song he's not even in it the first song  eminem 50 and ob trice oh really yeah i was all excited to hear them rap with biggie and he's not  even in the song like even in the first song i'm like well they really are running out of biggie  shit yeah and puppy would take like vocal tracks from his album and rename the song and just put  it i'm like this is me and my bitch or whatever you know amazing and you wonder why diddy dances 
[03:23:30]  like that when he's on when he's on stage he's happy are you a fan of diddy some of it some of the  stuff you put out was all right but you didn't like the diddy bop you you weren't doing that no  sam is a big fan of the diddy bop what yeah i'm not a big fan i can see i can see no i can  know you serious uh let me let me say hi to jeff in canada jeff he yipes jeff go ahead hey opi hey  buddy you're the modern day nostradamus now you predicted the air france disaster too oh yeah

[03:37:30]  long that maybe i'm not as big a fan as i used to be but i'm still in there okay i think the shack  lebron james thing is going to work out great for for cleveland i mean they're they're all in to try  to get that championship next year obviously but with the kids leaving fucking why wouldn't you  if you can make like multi millions of dollars i went to college it's not that important  in the end it's not that important they make it sound like it's the most important thing to do on 
[03:38:00]  this planet if you're 17 18 years old and you could blow off college and start making a  shitload of money who are we to say that's that's wrong exactly look at us we're having a ball we  don't isn't that why you go to college is to get a good career so you can make all the money so if  you can make all the money right away then you know what else are they going to be learning from  because it's just it's just something for people to criticize that's all it is you know what i mean  it's just something for them to take the chance of playing college ball and fucking blown out a knee  or something come on man yeah you're most likely i don't even think it i don't even think this is 
[03:38:30]  an argument worth making it's so obvious that yeah they should do this i damn sure would you know what  kills me too is like i i rarely hear the same argument posed for like all the eight-year-olds in tv  shows and movies like nobody was out there being like dakota fanning this needs to stop this is wrong  oh he's gotta leave yeah wait all right it's 13 seconds this is lebron james uh going after the  yeah the analyst and for all you haters and all you analysts out there that's talking about 
[03:39:00]  high school players ain't ready for the pros you got something coming watch out ain't nobody  with us this is out of control man i'm gonna be right back all right hey hey now enjoy this is the  worst of old p anthony sirius xm the worst of the worst of the old p anthony show right here on sirius xm  you guys let's go to bill donahue and uh and we'll go back to laszlo and uh the new rock star  james here uh bill how are you sir how you guys doing you didn't just hear that you didn't just 
[03:39:30]  hear that last two minutes did you no it didn't piss me off don't worry oh good uh well let's get  right to it then speaking of being pissed off you uh you seem to be all over the place uh larry david of  course did an episode of curb your enthusiasm where he takes some kind of drug because he's having  urinary problems and when he urinates uh at uh uh an employee's uh house uh a picture of jesus is up 
[03:40:00]  on the wall and some of his urine gets up by uh the picture of jesus's eye and the people in the  house go in the bathroom afterwards after larry leaves and say oh my god it's a miracle because  they think the picture is crying and they want to take this on tour now obviously uh bill you have a  problem with this uh basically what is your take on it and uh why why the problem well you know  most of the stuff that that seems across my desk lately is always gratuitous it comes out of nowhere  it's not even integral or functional to the show so you wonder what is it about the writers that they 
[03:40:30]  feel a need to let's see now what can we do how can we tick off catholics uh obviously nobody would  piss on obama because then you'd be a racist and you'd be obscene and we know all about that  and been to my house yeah i mean these these or as i say you know listen uh we can put some feces on  them on a picture of the mother of larry david and then just see how much he wants to laugh about uh you  know what though i i watched the episode last night um just to prep for this uh bill you know i do i do 
[03:41:00]  do i do prep for you um and what i saw was something that was kind of if you're if you have a knowledge of  of curb your enthusiasm it was integral to the story because it is outrageous and and uh he does  put himself in these odd very awkward situations i don't think it was gratuitous i don't think it  it was prolonged it was something that uh had happened and it wasn't as if he was doing it to  desecrate uh jesus on purpose or the image of jesus it was part of the story as we've seen in the news 
[03:41:30]  many times people uh proclaiming they see miracles happening with uh uh jesus crying or or mary  bleeding um uh why would you take this as being any more than that it's a cheap shot and it's always  jesus or it's always a catholic priest or a nun it's it's never anybody else's religion you don't  you don't think so this way anymore you know it's the same old nonsense i mean i and if it's not with  them i i just put out a statement just now you know we we look at these uh halloween costumes okay 
[03:42:00]  some some immigrant groups are complaining because they have an illegal area out there  we know when there was a danish cartoon of muhammad people led led to violence in the street now  there are costumes of nuns and priests out there which are fine there's costumes of jesus which i think  are funny uh as well as imams and ministers and rabbis but there's only one costume where it shows one  clergyman in it with an erection and the other one is a pregnant person i'm talking about a catholic  priest and a pregnant nun now it's not being carried in in walmart and target right i've seen that 
[03:42:30]  over the years when i was a kid i i used to see people do that sir bill donahue sir oh this is  patrice o'neill do you think god needs your help in these matters so why don't you just stop  like that's all i'm saying why don't you just stop being the representative for god i heard you  say i about three times here's my problem i always have to make things racial how come the upsetness is 
[03:43:00]  not the fact that jesus always looks like charles manson instead of what he really is somebody from  the middle east no he wasn't he was a son of god and god we all know is a white man why doesn't that  offend you why is the fact that he looks like a session drummer i think well you know what i think we  need more amos and andy a little black sambo yeah we do and this is what they he wants because  everything is really it's a it's a it's like snitching it's like why don't i how come we can't 
[03:43:30]  do you can if you want but you don't make fun of anything so you want people to not make fun to have  fun make fun what about the joker face that everybody want what we could we could make  do your thing bill let's hear a good michelle joke let's go baby i'll laugh if it's funny  her ass is a little big go ahead you you get my point you know i don't get your point no you you  you just you just i don't care yeah how about i don't care you would really no you don't know me 
[03:44:00]  that's what i'm saying i'm not wait wait what do you what do you got on al sharpton al sharpton  would be the first one to go for your head of course if anything like this happened we see what  happened with okay okay what i'm saying is that one more time we got this duplicitous hypocritical  people out there who say oh no leave leave off the gays oh i could have some fun with some gay  costumes let me tell you about that but they ain't gonna go there are they they're just over and over 
[03:44:30]  and over again but you're not giving me any reason this is it's like any reason it's like no no wait a minute it's  like sometimes it's like having you ever have a woman and she says something's not funny and or  something you think is not funny right and then and then and then you go okay well make it funny for  me what can you please tell me say something that makes me go you know what funny is well did you  think what larry david did was funny it could have been he should have been able to do it and was it 
[03:45:00]  funny did he i don't think patrice actually saw it i did i saw it i saw the clip and and the two  women that got on their knees and thought he was really crying he was making fun of those goofs as  opposed to right on jesus yeah it wasn't a desecrating you're being literal he's just making  fun of the catholic woman is that what it is that was making fun of hilarious you don't you don't think  people are a little crazy even see it do you you can't even connect the dots you're so you're not  connecting the dots no i do you're you're being you're being self i don't even want to say righteous 
[03:45:30]  but you just dude stop i think i think larry day was making fun of the fact that people find like  the image of jesus or the virgin mary and like in english muffin and then you know next thing you know  they're traveling around the country showing everybody and then and people blindly believe that  something actually happened there and that's not jesus again that's a that's a white guy  it's a white guy with long delicious hair let him speak yes bill but you've got fringe people in  every demographic group in society and the question is why is it not legitimate fair then to pick on 
[03:46:00]  that fringe group within other different groups larry david uh what it makes many uh jewish jokes  about himself on curb your enthusiasm nothing vulgar nothing obscene i mean no but it's very  stereotypical jewish yeah but you know what again if i just gave you an example i don't care even  about costumes of jesus and priests and nuns as long as they're just making some white fun of them as 
[03:46:30]  they do others but when you have the kinds of vulgar stuff that i described and it's only my group my  clergy my religious then you have to begin to wonder why is it why why do we have this pattern  over and over again can you tell me which is a crusader victim can you tell me the crew is a victimized  you're victimizing uh again you're victimizing catholicism you're victimizing because you're like  if i it's the reason why i can't listen with the purpose it's the reason why i like i can't say no more 
[03:47:00]  white people have figured out a way to get black people not to say no more by saying n-word because if you  can't have fun nobody can so you think christianity is under attack but it ain't it's a it's a jesus  joke and you still didn't answer me bill bill you still didn't answer me about this white jesus you  still didn't answer it what about like yeah i don't care about what if what if i'm offended that jesus  is always white when he's from the middle east well i mean that's not vulgar that's a matter of 
[03:47:30]  interpretation why aren't you upset about that catholic league we don't okay okay if you're  upset about if you care about that if you're upset about a figurative act of defamation against yeah  you're saying jesus but it's a fake jesus picture of your mother you're not going to get upset it's a fake  portrayal of jesus for a moment you don't believe yourself you're just trying to stop people from 
[03:48:00]  having fun stop leave people alone that had like to have fun people agree with me than they agree  yes why don't you just go into rooms with them and leave people who are funny alone tell your friend  al shopton and his buddies at the end there you go my friend because he's black there you go bill we  know what you really are you're going to slip up as you keep talking people know each other exactly  bill on this one you're going to slip up and the real r world's going to come out the r word  i'm not saying oh you know what it is i don't know what it is it's the r word if you use the n 
[03:48:30]  not exactly but you know what the n-word is you're an r if you use the n-word yeah you're  r of course you don't hey bill if you get mad enough you could call them you know what you  want say it say it bill it's in your heart let it go don't let it fester bill get it out you've  already been saying it in this condescending manner what if i put amos and andy huh mr negro 
[03:49:00]  how about your friend al sharpton how about your friend white jesus i'm just showing what a phony you  want no you're not oh no you're not no you're not you you you you're not fun you're not fun  there you go that's what bill really is that's what he really is that's what you really are yeah  i know i know hey you see the anger he came on very diplomatic very diplomatic you try to justify 
[03:49:30]  bigotry against one group but then you get upset when no i don't it comes back no i didn't no i didn't  they kind of did you kind of did say what what i did what i did what did i kind of did just tell me  what i did you kind of did tell me what i did you want to build what did i do bill what did i get mad  about what my point is simply this everybody has a hot button whether it be jesus or muhammad or or uh you  know a black minister whoever might be all funny all you gotta do is find that button and you press it and 
[03:50:00]  you get the same reaction yeah the button i'm pushing with you there's there's a there's a  there's a tendency in our culture to put push the buttons of catholics more than any of the group  okay when did this start has this been historic or has this started yesterday leviticus it started  leviticus you know when it started it started when people started paying attention to people like you  bill when we started going oh bill said something so we got to be scared of it bill just stay out of  fun business you know what xbox 360 is bill stick stick to stoning women that are unholy let's go 
[03:50:30]  let's go back to the rules on it when it's okay to enslave people or when it's when it's okay to  turn your daughter out as a whore let's go old testament right now if you want to talk about  offensive this is a white guy talking now by the way i'm not black at all he looks like jesus i'm from  oklahoma actually he looks like jesus she's this shitty shirt there proves he's white i bought this  in oklahoma it's all western western outfitters wait wait and just so bill knows lazio will be  going to hell with uh with what he does with his life oh my god yeah so there's a guarantee there so 
[03:51:00]  i'm i'm with you sir what is hbo saying about what you're saying bill same thing what i'm saying right  yeah you think uh you're gonna get an apology or any reaction to this by uh hbo or uh larry david no  listen bill maher has been defending catholics for years there's something pathological about  that man it's he's totally irrational i don't like hbo puts up with him then i threatened i  just joked on tv here about two years ago that i'd like to meet up with him in madison square garden 
[03:51:30]  put the everlast on and i beat the hell out of that punk he goes on larry king in a serious vein  and says bill donahue of the catholic league threatened me with violence shut up yeah because  you know what he did you know what he did though bill he kind of like bill donnie he took you  literally oh he took you he took you literal bill but when you was joking you were joking around  figuratively he should have known it shouldn't he have bill he should have known you were joking  mr serious lord oh my goodness you're threatening jesus christ then he had to figure he had to know 
[03:52:00]  you were joking didn't he was joking too and look what happened to him yeah yeah we weren't happy  about that one yeah we weren't happy about that hey we were joking yeah we were joking you don't  you don't know me but do you know i was the first one to defend him who built uh uh don um yeah patrice  fucked up his tv career because he went on and defended imus and uh he hasn't been back since  and he was great he was great on tv he did a lot of tv before that right is right and what you're 
[03:52:30]  doing is wrong because it's selfish it's selfish huh how often went for the jugular and even after  the man apologized you still want to get him fired i didn't ask for anything like that what's your  end game as far as this uh larry david thing goes what would what what would you like to see happen  look i've never asked for the government to come in and resolve these problems for me all i'm simply  saying is this uh i run an anti-defamation organization just like you have the adl and  naacp and glad and now and all these other different groups when you see something that you think crosses 
[03:53:00]  the line you're expected to to draw uh public opinion to try to persuade them to your side  all not funny groups by the way none of them are funny that's true like why don't you stay and listen  this is this is the deal i make why don't you just stay in the realm where if somebody goes if  somebody goes seriously i love i will piss on jesus's face stick to those people who seriously  want to do that we have that instead of wait a minute we had that last year when a professor 
[03:53:30]  from the university of minnesota intentionally took a consecrated host and drove a rusty nail  through it to say listen i don't give a damn about the body and blood of jesus christ i'm an atheist  his name is pz myers there's a lot of animals now can you agree can you agree that just that okay  that larry larry david was trying to be funny yeah look i don't think that because somebody  offends me that therefore he's necessarily a bigot we all tell jokes that could offend somebody 
[03:54:00]  what i know a bigot is when he does it over and over and over again i do say there's a problem at hbo  this is the first time to be fair to you okay patricia uh larry david uh do we see uh that that he's  a recidivist a repeat offender no he's not joy joy behar some pathological bitch who constantly is  going after the catholic church larry david is not that way i don't like her either you gotta love  bill's opinions oh lord i'm wow wait i'm glad this is not like wow 1806 because he'd be down here on 
[03:54:30]  his cart boy when when i have no thumbs and a lot of tar and feathers on me how bad do you want to  drink with bill bill donah here to find out what really goes under that i'd like to catch him  this is him under control this is just too much of a zealot man stop that look look i mean larry  david has obviously moved on he don't he doesn't care that much he's gonna move on to the next target  he's made fun of cripples and everything else on the damn show the real problem there is hbo because  sarah silverman went after catholics two weeks earlier whose show did she do it on 
[03:55:00]  bill marshall where's that shown on hbo so there is a problem over there at hbo let's just say it  together it's it's it's the jews it's always the jews uh let me address that very very like alie  frazier it's like alie frazier if you look at uh anti-catholicism in this country from the time of  the founding up through i'd say about the roughly through the the mid-20th century anti-catholicism  basically came from one group protestants i would say over the last 50 years it comes from two groups 
[03:55:30]  catholics who are alienated one foot out the door and left-wing secular jews it's very little  of it comes from uh protestants it's been a big change in the landscape well i still have um i  still have home uh blasphemy uh like this meetings we turn like that home blasphemy office we got a  lot of religion and a lot of racism thing that's happening right now what if uh larry david did the  same joke but it was uh i don't know malcolm x or martin luther king and then his uh p got on like a 
[03:56:00]  portrait of uh all right obama let's go to the all right it wouldn't be bill see bill's not it  wouldn't be bill it would be reverend right and that's what i was saying it's this this is where  it gets messed up bill you you're a man see people historically who are for humanity who are just for  humanity get killed in some kind of way jesus it was for completely the opposite of what you stand for 
[03:56:30]  he was for being everybody being together he didn't start a religion he was starting like a  movement of of love but no what i'm saying is al sharpton will his job is to get offended with  malcolm x your job is to get offended with jesus somebody else's job is to get offended with muhammad  but the idea is there's no humanity there it's still secular it's still xenophobic it's terrible behavior  we're not human anymore you're doing what you're supposed to do you're not angry at other things 
[03:57:00]  you're not angry at cruelty to animals you're not angry at genocide and and in africa because  are you bill cruelty to animals i think this case before the supreme court is i would come down on the  side of saying that that's not protected speech under the first amendment when madison wrote talked  talked about freedom of speech there's a case that the supreme court is has agreed to hear they  won't render a judgment until the spring i don't think intentionally being cruel to animals should  be freedom of speech what yeah it's usually fear freedom of religion if you don't choke a chicken 
[03:57:30]  and then uh you know you do something like that yeah yeah you know there's people there's not enough  everything that's wrong should be mentioned by anybody for on any group if it's just wrong  larry david has free speech i have free speech i didn't ask for anybody to get fired i don't  understand what the big stink is about you just you are a defender of the faith he so when he when  he says see something he doesn't like keeper of the faith he speaks out and uh lets people uh makes 
[03:58:00]  people aware that him and his constituency are not happy with what went on uh when it's taken over the  line and people lose their jobs over it and things like that then i have a problem with it this guy can  say whatever the fuck he wants fair enough but just but i would love these people and when i say  these people i mean everybody who's an advocate oh please could you just be fun for five seconds  let's do something frivolous nothing fun about damnation wait wait he's got a sense of humor bill 
[03:58:30]  what do you find funny what do you find funny bill who's your favorite comic who's my favorite comic  i'll tell you what i for years i've liked jerry seinfeld i mean i think he's i think he's i have to say  larry david's a brilliant guy because he created that show and i guess that was part of the thing  that made us win to say why would a guy that smart have to stoop this low that's really sure well it's  kind of cutting edge in a way it really is because it didn't it it wasn't it wasn't perpetuated through  the whole thing it wasn't done with malice and stuff it was part of the story that wheelchair
