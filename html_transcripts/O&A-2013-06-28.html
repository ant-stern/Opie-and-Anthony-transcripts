<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy and vulgar phone call with Stalker Patty, a long-time listener.  Patty detailed her life, including her low-paying Starbucks job, financial struggles (including an $18,000 surgery bill), lack of romantic success, frugal lifestyle, cat's "well-baby checkup," and casino visits.  The conversation, punctuated by sexually suggestive and offensive jokes, also revisited past on-air stunts, including a "mousetrap" segment where Patty was (partially) naked.  The hosts discussed current events like the Aaron Hernandez murder investigation and the Trayvon Martin case, but the focus remained primarily on Patty's eccentric personality and anecdotes.  Mentions were made of other recurring characters, Lady Di and Marion, who were scheduled to appear later.

Later in the show, Lady Di and Marion joined Opie and Anthony in the studio.  The conversation, filled with off-color remarks and discussions of their personal lives, quickly became chaotic. Lady Di made a controversial statement using a racial slur, which was addressed by the hosts and guests.  Colin Quinn was also a guest in the studio, contributing to the already high energy level.  The discussion covered Lady Di's past marriage, her ex-husband, and the details of their divorce, including the division of her 401k.  The segment included numerous tangents, such as Lady Di's upcoming trip to a Monkees convention (which unexpectedly included actors from shows like *The Brady Bunch*), her love of Bon Jovi and the Monkees, past cruises, and a karaoke performance of "I'm a Believer."  The hosts frequently interrupted Lady Di with derogatory terms like "babbling cunt" and "babbling dick."  A significant portion focused on an incident involving Lady Di experiencing what was initially believed to be a period, leading to a studio-wide search for sanitary products and crude jokes.  Phone calls from listeners, including Bob Levy (who was abruptly dismissed), were interspersed throughout.  An attempted Pyramid game was quickly abandoned due to the chaotic atmosphere.  The segment concluded with a karaoke performance of Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a Prayer" by Lady Di and Marion, accompanied by further crude jokes and banter.

A subsequent segment featured further discussion of Lady Di’s dating life and an attempt to arrange a date for her to see The Monkees, involving various studio personnel and even Colin Quinn.  The segment included jokes about Bobo's failed attempts to get Mets tickets with Jerry Seinfeld, using strategies including Twitter.  The introduction of a surprise guest, Ira, led to awkward interactions and jokes about his and Lady Di’s dating prospects.  Casino gambling habits were also discussed.  A dysfunctional attempt at playing "The Pyramid Game," hampered by Lady Di's apparent intoxication and the hosts’ inappropriate comments, dominated a substantial portion of this segment.  Various team combinations, including Bobo and Jackie the Intern, participated in the game, which was punctuated with numerous sexually suggestive and offensive remarks.

Another segment featured a vulgar trivia contest between Bobo and Jackie, dedicated to two Twitter friends, with clues centered around bodily functions and sexual acts.  The game ended with everyone being declared a winner.  Lady Di and Marion returned, and the conversation, already highly informal, descended into numerous sexually suggestive and offensive comments directed at the guests and Opie.  The arrival of DJ Who Kid further escalated the raunchiness, with discussions about race, sex, and body parts, and sexually explicit jokes targeting the guests' physical attributes.  Bobo ultimately licked Lady Di's armpit after some hesitation. The segment concluded with more crude remarks before the guests' departure was marked as a return to quiet in the studio.  An “After ONA Live” segment with Sam Roberts followed, further discussing Bobo's armpit-licking and the overall chaos.

The show's closing segments touched upon undelivered listener contest prizes, leading to speculation about intern incompetence or mail theft.  Bobo accused the MTA of corruption, citing misuse of funds.  Lady Di and Marion returned, and their unemployment and lifestyles were discussed with humorous jabs.  There were mentions of DJ Who Kid and his physical interactions with Lady Di, described as non-sexual touching.  The final moments promoted Sydney's upcoming radio show, Who Kid's promotion of 50 Cent's birthday party and the BET Awards,  social media, and the show's schedule.  Throughout, the show maintained a highly informal tone, replete with crude language and sexually suggestive humor.

Well thank you guys.  Yes.  Booga booga Mike Tyson.  Booga booga indeed.  Welcome.  That song of course means.  It's Friday.  It is a goddamn Friday.  It is a goddamn Friday.  And let's not forget Mike Tyson's birthday.  We learned that yesterday from his pal.  Happy birthday to me.  Sunday. 
[00:06:00]  Happy birthday to me.  Oh yeah.  Sunday.  It's Lady Diane Marion day.  Crazy day we have planned for today.  We have a shitload of new listeners since the last time they came on.  So.  My God.  So maybe this is not a big deal for a bunch of people out there but it's a huge deal for  us.  Well they got a little preface with the Lady Di phone calls that we've had over the past  few weeks.  Kind of. 
[00:06:30]  Kind of.  Yeah.  A little insight in what Lady Di's about.  Marion though.  Some people.  It's going to be the first time they ever hear Marion.  Has she been on our show since we've been on satellite?  Yes.  Very early on.  Very early on.  Maybe one time.  Phone call.  Yeah.  Alright.  She's a trip.  And Lady Di, within five minutes you'll know everything about her.  Oh yeah.  Because nothing has changed in her life.  Hey guys.  How are you?  Looking for a job?  Hell yes.  She's going to be all smiles like everything's fine and meanwhile her life is a pile of shit. 
[00:07:00]  Well maybe it is fine.  Oh maybe.  Maybe it is fine in her stupid head.  Maybe it is.  Because I mean nothing has changed and she seems happy.  Yeah.  Who are we to judge?  Who are we to judge?  People with good lives who see shitty lives and recognize them.  Yeah.  So looking forward to that.  Absolutely.  And then for some reason we decided to just throw Bobo into the mix.  To the mix.  Well I wanted Stalker Patty too.  Stalker Patty would have been good too.  Like a real reunion. 
[00:07:30]  I wanted all the.  I wanted all the.  The regulars that I don't understand why they're fans of the show.  Right.  I have no idea why they're huge fans of the show.  Yeah.  It would have been like one of those.  One of those hair band reunion concerts.  Sure.  You know.  Look who's here.  Holy shit.  Lady Di.  Marion.  Who else is on the build?  Bobo.  What the fuck?  Stalker Patty all in one place.  Oh my god.  Damn.  Yeah.  Why isn't Patty coming?  She's probably working or something. 
[00:08:00]  We tried.  I mean.  Having a fucking divot taken out of her neck.  What the fuck?  We wish her nothing but the best.  Oh of course we do.  Now that she's what?  82 or something like that.  I don't know.  How old is she now?  Maybe she had a dose of dick.  You know.  Women have glands and things and all kinds of shit going on in their body where you know.  They need some dick.  Wow.  To kind of get this shit rocking and rolling and activated.  Now that her body's officially starting to rot. 
[00:08:30]  Why don't you just take the dick now finally?  Take the dick.  Jesus Patty.  What are you waiting for?  Just a spoonful of dick helps the medicine go down.  Go down.  Anyway.  Should be a lot of fun with them.  Maybe Patty could call the show before she goes to Starbucks.  Oh I'm working at Starbucks.  For her shifts.  For her one shift a week or whatever the hell it is.  I've accumulated eight minutes of vacation time. 
[00:09:00]  And then she wasted.  Coming here.  Or just making a phone call.  Yeah.  That's like a week's vacation for most people.  I used it up going to the bank.  Dude man.  I can't get enough.  I mean there's so much news.  Oh yeah.  The news cycle has been crazy this week.  A lot of stuffs.  The Aaron Hernandez is I can't get enough of this.  That's another huge story.  I know a lot of people are focusing on the Zimmerman.  Yeah.  The Trayvon Martin thing.  Yeah.  With Rachel Jantel.  Rachel Jantel. 
[00:09:30]  But this Aaron Hernandez thing is becoming very interesting.  Yeah.  Now they're thinking he might be involved in another double murder.  Double murder.  Last year they were looking for a rental car since July of 2012.  So that's almost a year ago and they found it.  Loves those rental cars.  And he was the one that rented it and they know this car was involved in a double homicide.  They're speculating that's why he had this other guy killed.  What are you doing?  Is because he knew about the double murder and then he's talking to some people at this 
[00:10:00]  club and then he's just like you know I gotta kill this guy.  He knows about the other double murder.  Were they people who were involved with the people that were killed?  Who knows?  Maybe.  There's a lot of speculation going on right now.  No one knows anything.  Maybe not.  Who knows.  Yeah.  You know they have said that the car they've been looking for he rented.  So at one time.  This guy just is a ruthless fucking piece of shit man.  You had a charmed life. 
[00:10:30]  What are you doing?  Yeah.  The fuck you doing?  And then he's just sat there in office in offices with big wigs of big NFL and hanging  out with Tom Brady and just smiling and he's a fucking allegedly a mass murderer.  At this point if it's I think that officially that makes him a mass murderer.  Not just a murderer.  Mass murderer.  Just signed for 40 million dollars.  That's fucking nuts.  Crazy.  So fucked up.  Oh hold on a minute.  Cray cray. 
[00:11:00]  Well we got the answer to the Patty question.  She's on the line.  Oh goody.  It's always some weird little thing.  Stalker Patty.  Hey how are you?  What's up?  Oh I like your morning voice Patty.  I'd go as far as to call it sultry.  I'd go as far as to call it sultry.  Wow a little sultry there.  Very nice.  Sultry.  Hmm.  Well that's what I sound like when I first wake up I was sleeping.  Yeah I know we figured all that out.  You didn't have to describe what you were doing before you woke up.  We figured all that out just by hearing your voice Patty. 
[00:11:30]  That's what I sound like when I first wake up right after calisthenics.  She would be perfect.  We got to team her up with the horse lady.  Prancing lady.  Prancing lady.  Prancing lady with Stalker Patty would be a huge hit.  What a conversation.  Patty are you working at Starbucks today?  Not today.  I'm off.  Hold on.  That's my alarm.  Give me a second.  Are you up?  Well I'm about to get up.  I have to take my cat to the vet this morning for her well baby checkup. 
[00:12:00]  Wait.  Wait.  Her what?  It's just never.  Her well baby checkup.  Well baby.  What's a well baby checkup?  What is that?  Just to make sure she's good.  It's based on baby Jessica.  One and a half.  You know she's got to get her shot.  You know.  Is that.  Are you just telling her that but you're going to just leave her on the counter at  a diner?  No.  Yeah.  Why.  Why.  The stupid vets have figured out how you know to get more money out of you. 
[00:12:30]  Of course.  And they've come up with cute names.  The well baby checkup.  Well baby.  And then.  What the fuck.  Patty goes around going.  Tomorrow's your well baby checkup.  Actually it's a free visit because I got a postcard they just opened.  I'm going to try them out.  More useless information.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh man.  New vet.  Who answers postcards?  A postcard.  What year is this?  Jesus.  You got a postcard and decided.  Yeah.  My cat needs a well baby checkup. 
[00:13:00]  God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I scheduled.  Patty.  Stop.  We'd like you to come to the vet.  Stop.  Come here at 1pm.  Stop.  Oh my God.  A well baby checkup.  What's wrong with you.  Well baby.  You're falling for all the scams Patty.  Yeah.  You know.  I mean.  Animals.  We never took our animals to the vets.  And they either died of old age or getting hit by a car in front of our house.  That's how it happens.  That was it really. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  You know.  I mean you go to the vet and they tell you.  Yeah.  It's got.  It's got that cat cancer.  Sorry.  They can't really.  They can't really save pets yet.  Not like that.  Not really.  They really can't.  People think they can.  But.  Not really.  I only bring her once every two or three years.  You know.  Because she's a house cat.  She doesn't go out.  Well of course.  So I'll just explain that to him too.  You know.  But just to make sure she's okay.  Does she look okay?  She looks great.  All right. 
[00:14:00]  Then you should have went to work today.  Actually I'm off on Fridays.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh.  You got the big weekend off.  How do you spend your weekends Patty?  Well I just.  You know.  Go into the city later on.  And I'll just.  You know.  Walk around.  Go to a museum.  Sometimes.  You know.  Once.  You'll have to convince them to let you leave.  Once in a great while.  You know.  Once in a great while.  I might take a bus down to Atlantic City.  Another one. 
[00:14:30]  Walk around the border.  Another one.  That's just.  It's fun.  Atlantic City.  Yeah.  That's exciting.  Why didn't you come in today?  Well.  Like I said.  I have this appointment.  Oh.  You stopped that dumb vet.  You could go next week.  Yeah.  It's a.  It's a.  It's a.  I don't do that.  Once I make an appointment.  I commit myself.  Oh.  Good for you Patty.  Yeah.  I made.  Patty.  We want you in here today.  We haven't seen you in a while.  I know. 
[00:15:00]  We haven't seen you in a while.  You know who's coming in today?  Yeah.  I know.  I heard.  Wouldn't you love to see them?  Yeah.  I've been hearing her on the radio.  She.  You know.  Seven weeks to find the job.  Oh.  She's fucking talking shit.  Seven weeks.  See.  She's talking shit about Lady Di.  Nice.  Patty.  That's great.  There's no reason for her to be unemployed for four years if it took.  If it.  You know.  If it only took me seven weeks.  You're a go getter though Patty. 
[00:15:30]  You get out there.  You are pounding the pavement.  Oh.  She doesn't shut up.  Well Patty.  Why aren't you here to tell her that?  You know.  Why didn't you come in and tell her that?  Well.  Well.  I'm sorry.  I can't.  I know.  The cat.  The well baby visit.  Well.  Yeah.  I'm a responsible pet owner.  I'm a responsible pet owner.  Yeah.  I'm a responsible pet owner.  Alright.  Alright.  Responsible pet owner.  And half the time you bring your.  Oh.  Forget it. 
[00:16:00]  If only you gave the other pussy that much attention.  Maybe you're not a fucking wife.  And also.  Not only that.  But after I'm done with that.  I tell ya.  Just keep talking.  So let's have a conversation.  Whatever.  A lot of the times you bring your pet to the vet.  Yeah.  It ends up coming home with something bad.  Of course.  They got that fucking.  Or they do a little procedure that turns it into a fucking major issue.  That feline leukemia is like fucking.  Right.  Like pixie dust in those fucking veterinarians.  Exactly.  It's terrible.  So.  Oh yeah. 
[00:16:30]  It doesn't matter.  It was good and all.  Yeah.  Not too bad.  Good.  I was very involved.  Nice.  Twitter and whatnot.  But.  Alright Patty.  Anything else?  How's your health?  We saw that big huge thing on the side of your neck that they took out.  Right?  Because her head.  Leaking pus.  Huh?  For a long time.  In fact I have a social services appointment to discuss.  You know.  Maybe helping paying for it from this hospital.  Because they have a department for that.  Because my. 
[00:17:00]  Surgery was $18,000.  Holy shit.  Who's paying for that?  You know.  Oh.  It was B9 by the way.  The part that.  We didn't ask.  Who uh.  B7.  B8.  B9.  The way she talks.  You know what.  Call me.  Yeah.  I'll be a little hoarse.  The big ones are usually benign.  She'll be a little hoarse.  Yeah.  I'll be a little hoarse.  Oh.  He should come in and meet our big horse.  He's.  Running aboard today.  Yeah.  You know what. 
[00:17:30]  Oh my god.  I'll be happy to come in to meet your horse person.  Now your neck.  What did they remove?  What was it?  Boo.  It was half my thyroid.  It had lumps on it and stuff.  So they had to check it out.  And they couldn't get a determination from two biopsies.  So.  Biopsy.  Biopsy.  Hygiene.  Biopsy.  Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.  Biopsy.  Yeah.  It's fucking.  She's Paulie Walnut.  Yeah.  Biopsy. 
[00:18:00]  Paulie Walnut brain.  Biopsy.  But she said the surgery was $18,000.  Who paid for that?  Yeah.  Obama.  No.  I don't have any insurance at all.  I can't afford it.  Yeah.  Who paid for it?  Well, I'm going to be put on a payment plan.  Oh.  How long?  How long?  And they'll also give me maybe something towards it at the hospital.  Patty, how long is this payment plan going to take for you to pay off 18 large?  Yeah.  How much do you have to pay a week? 
[00:18:30]  Not a week.  That probably put me on a payment plan, maybe $30 a month or something.  $30 a month.  No.  I'm going to tell you.  How old are you?  You're fucking.  If you had children and they had children.  $30.  You'd be paying that off.  $360 a year.  Why would they even bother at that point?  Why bother?  Well, you know, I think they just call it life, you know.  But Patty does pay her bills.  She does.  You got to give her respect for that.  She'll make that fucking payment.  Do you know how many people just blow off those hospital bills, Patty? 
[00:19:00]  Sure.  Good for you, Patty.  Well, I'm not like that.  I try to be responsible.  Hey, we heard you.  You should blow it off.  No one's going to fucking come after you.  Absolutely.  Now the vet's going to hit you up with some cash today.  Oh, it's a free visit from the postcard.  She'll get there and they'll fucking con her into buying some goddamn skin spray for her.  They'll see her coming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, your cat.  You got to do this and that.  Your cat's in great shape. 
[00:19:30]  But Patty, if you want to keep your cat a well baby, what you need is this fur spray.  This is for their nails and this is for their teeth.  And then you leave like, thank you with this big shopping bag.  I'm not taken in by sales.  Tattics.  You're answering.  What?  Tattics?  I'm not taken in like that.  You know, I'll just go for the free checkup.  I only take her once every single year.  You don't go for that stuff.  You answered a postcard. 
[00:20:00]  Postcards.  Yeah.  So you're already going for it.  And for the most part, the only people that send out postcards like that are businesses  that are a little desperate.  Right.  So now they get you in the door.  They're going to try to squeeze something out of you.  They just opened.  They're near.  They only just had their opening over the summer.  Uh oh.  Over the summer.  That was a year ago.  Summer is a couple of days in.  I mean, just over this, yeah, just like about a month or so.  Uh oh.  Oh boy.  They're going to, they're going to hit you up.  It's not on the back of a Chinese restaurant, is it?  No. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  Just making sure.  No.  Your cat to pass away.  How great would that be?  Every fucking animal that goes in there.  Oh, terrible.  Oh God.  Jesus.  Another one that answers jokes.  You tap dancing.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Well, I do have a rule.  Where Evie goes, I go.  So I'll be in there with her. 
[00:21:00]  Your rule is what?  Where Evie goes, I go.  Evie.  Evie.  That's what E-Rock is.  Where my cat goes, I am.  He's Evie!  Sorry, E-Rock.  It's twice in like no time.  That's how Jimmy says it.  Hey, he's Evie!  Hey, he's Evie.  He's not going to the gym and eating.  Hi!  All right.  What else, Patty?  Everything else is good with you? 
[00:21:30]  Obviously, we don't even...  Everything else is good with me.  We don't even have to ask you about Dick, because we know the answer to that.  Any dating at all going on?  Any guys joining you at the museum?  No.  Basically, you know, by myself.  You know, once in a while, I go with a couple friends.  That's about it.  A friend took me to dinner yesterday for my birthday, you know.  To dinner for my birthday.  When was your birthday?  When the fuck was your birthday?  It was June 4th.  So he took me, you know, like, last night.  A date? 
[00:22:00]  Not a date.  Why not a date?  Did you blow him for the meal or what, Patty, huh?  Yeah.  Is it the guy from 1010 Wins?  What?  We still keep in touch.  You touch each other?  And every year, he takes me to dinner on my birthday.  Did you put it in your mouth?  No.  Suck his cock?  Just dinner.  Are you part of the Make-A-Wish?  Just dinner.  Are you a Make-A-Wish thing?  They have to take you to dinner once a year? 
[00:22:30]  Once a year.  Yeah, she won a dream date with ox.  No, it's just been like, it's a tradition.  It's been like that for years, you know, every year again.  All right, all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where'd you go to dinner?  It says a lot about the man.  Where did he take you?  Oh, it was at a trittoria place on the upper left side.  A trittoria place.  I didn't hear you, Patty.  Please say that again.  Like an Italian trittoria or something like that.  Trittoria.  There's my first video on the upper east side. 
[00:23:00]  She speaks for another time, man.  She's some Italian trittoria.  You know, he even took me to the Friars Club for dinner there.  Oh, that's nice.  Because he's a member.  That's very nice.  Oh, a member of the Friars Club.  Looks like you got a nice friendship there.  What did you have at the Italian restaurant, Patty?  Oh, I had laguini with seafood.  The only thing is I let him have the squid that was in it because it looks like an octopus. 
[00:23:30]  I felt like you were cannibalizing.  Wow, so you shared your squid.  Did it look like that scene from Lady and the Tramp?  Did you have tentacles in your mouth and you met at that ugly octopus head and kissed?  Can you hit the bell?  She just answered that with a no.  Of course she did.  She answered that with a no.  Nothing better than the answering of the joke.  No.  I don't put testicles in my mouth.  It looks like a baby octopus. 
[00:24:00]  I don't need those.  Put that vagina?  Yeah.  Patty, how old are you now?  How old?  Oh, I'm 58 now.  Holy shit.  Oh my God.  Are you serious?  I'm at Starbucks.  I'm at Starbucks.  58.  I think we started.  Talk 30.  Was she a 45-year-old virgin or something?  Well, we met her very early on in NEW 98.  We got to NEW two 15 years ago, I guess.  Yeah.  She was 43.  43-year-old virgin. 
[00:24:30]  We met her as a 43-year-old virgin.  She's now 58 and still a virgin.  Patty.  Now you're pushing 60.  Patty.  I'm going to be the oldest virgin in a wheelchair when I'm old.  When?  Your fucking parents fucked you up.  I'm so mad at that.  Man, did they ever.  No.  Fuck the person.  Sexuality.  I think I'm healthier because of that.  Yeah.  With pulling fucking basketballs out of your neck.  Jesus Christ, Patty.  Come on.  Patty, live a little. 
[00:25:00]  Maybe she's living.  Yeah.  I don't know.  She went to that tutorial.  Whatever the fuck.  The Triteria.  You know, every once in a while I like the Empire, you know, which is the casino that's  in the Yonkers.  No.  I thought she was talking about where she grew up.  No one.  The Roman one.  Can I say something, Patty?  No one actually likes the Empire.  No.  They go there to feed their addiction.  Exactly.  No one actually likes it.  You know, it's something weird.  Who likes it? 
[00:25:30]  It's not a good casino.  You want to hear something weird?  I saw an elderly lady.  You come in and we see something weird.  She's still talking, of course, and we'd have to make her start over.  I know.  You know, but...  What, Patty?  What?  What?  Well, anyway, so an elderly lady had a machine.  Six weeks later, I went back to the same place.  After six weeks, the same lady was at the same machine.  That was a mirror, Patty.  I wasn't here more than two months ago. 
[00:26:00]  You just made my point.  I said just a mere few minutes ago, no one enjoys going there.  They have to feed their addiction, and you saw just that with this lady.  She has to go to the same machine because of the whole fucking superstition thing.  There's no way you could see the same person twice.  Well, there is.  She's probably telling someone right now, I saw a bag of bones come walking at it with  a Frankenstein scar on her neck.  Remember that ghost I saw?  It came back. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, it's so weird, though, and I didn't go for almost two months.  Yeah, I know.  I heard it sunk in.  We're amazed, too.  Don't worry about it.  Not really that weird.  Not really.  That's not a weird one.  No, she's probably a dick.  Maybe she's there every single day.  I don't know.  Whoa!  She's cracking up over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you still masturbating or what?  Uh-oh.  No, I didn't do that this morning, no.  I didn't say this morning, but are you still masturbating? 
[00:27:00]  At all.  Still healthy down there?  Oh, I don't think so.  Not in a long time.  What?  Who do you think about these days?  Still the edge?  Well, you know, I like him, but I also have a crush on Paul McCartney.  Jesus.  As he gets older, he gets older. 
[00:27:30]  I can't imagine one woman having a crush on Paul McCartney still.  You might be the last woman that has a crush on him.  Well, I know back in the day he put up numbers, but...  Of course.  I don't think there's a lot of women out there fucking drooling for him.  Oh, the fab four.  I love those lovable mop tops.  So, last year or two years ago, I got a Paul McCartney concert for my birthday from 
[00:28:00]  my same friend, and all the people in the audience were like, whoa, you know.  You should throw this guy some fucking pussy.  Guy does everything for you.  They didn't throw underwear at Paul McCartney.  Come on.  Come on, Patty.  Yeah.  Hey, Patty, why do you think he's so dreamy?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I think he gets better looking as he gets older.  You know, like fine wine. 
[00:28:30]  Like fine wine.  Jesus.  Would you take his dick?  Yesterday.  No.  My mother put me down and walked away.  Oh, no.  Patty.  I will never have a lay.  Crazy.  Oh, we're crazy.  Oh, man.  Just nuts.  Oh, Patty.  Patty said she wouldn't take Paul McCartney's dick.  What? 
[00:29:00]  What's wrong with you?  It's crazy.  You wouldn't even take a Beatles dick?  No.  No, no, no, no.  Fucking parents fucked her up.  Oh, man.  Fake parents, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  They were getting money from the state.  That foster father really fucked her up.  That foster shit.  I'm sure there's a few people that did very well in foster care, but in general.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're taking the money and running.  That foster father, he did a lot of damage there, coming in while you're taking a bath  and sleeping with you on the couch.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Not good.  Nothing happened, though.  Yeah.  As far as you recall.  You already determined that.  Well, it's obvious by talking to you.  Yeah.  You just blocked it out, is what you did.  You got a piece of that.  You got a piece of that.  I don't know.  I think I'm pretty healthy now.  No, you're not.  I mean, you know, physically maybe, but mentally you're a disaster area.  Going to museums all alone.  No, I'm very happy.  What museum do you like going to in New York? 
[00:30:00]  The Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Television and Radio is interesting, too,  because they're interaction-type things.  All right, this is perfect Patty shit.  I love it.  You do know you can do all that on your laptop now.  Oh, Patty.  When we first moved to New York, the Museum of TV and Radio, whatever the hell it's officially  called, was pretty amazing, because you go in there and you pick out all sorts of shit  you want to watch.  It could be maybe a rare Richard Pryor appearance on whatever show or what have you. 
[00:30:30]  But now all that stuff, you could just-  Pop it up, yeah.  You could get it on your phone now, Patty.  You don't have to go there anymore.  I don't know that.  But there's nothing like being there.  Being where?  In a warehouse?  In a cubicle?  With other assholes that are just trying to stay warm inside for a couple hours?  Where is it?  It's right around here, too.  I forget.  I used to go there quite often.  I want to go, actually.  It was kind of fun.  Yeah.  Is it near where we are now? 
[00:31:00]  I forget.  Yeah, it's somewhere close.  Patty, where is it?  In the 50s somewhere.  It's on the west side of the city in the 50s.  Near, I would say, very close to where the Apple Store is.  Oh, okay.  So you're going to pay to win?  And I like going into the Apple Store, too.  It's fun to try out the iPods and the different things.  You know?  That's also, like, amazing to me, too.  Why don't you try them out?  You try them out once.  Oh, she doesn't think so.  I try out the Apple iPods. 
[00:31:30]  Apple 5?  I try out the Kindles.  There's no Kindles in the Apple Store.  Make sure you lick the screens.  How do you try them out?  You go in there and what?  Yeah, they do have a table where you could go and pick them up and actually do them.  Really?  I didn't know that.  They should put you on that table.  Did anyone else know this, that you could go in there and do that?  I had no idea.  Patty!  Patty!  Walk us through this.  You walk into the Apple Store and then what happens? 
[00:32:00]  Well, sometimes I go online on the computers that are set up.  You know?  And then sometimes I go to the iPads and stuff like that.  I like looking at all the new things.  I really want to go with fun, you know?  Okay, what's the newest gadget you have?  Because you like looking at them.  Like, what's your pride and joy?  Well, I got a Galaxy for Christmas, you know, from some relatives in New Jersey. 
[00:32:30]  Because I have a nephew out there.  Oh, boy.  And his father is my foster brother.  And he got that for me.  Father is the foster brother?  Tagged her too, I bet.  Yeah, I got a good deal, like $80 a month I pay.  And that's my contract.  I'd love to see how many monthly payments Patty has.  She's just fucking cramping up writing those checks.  Oh, this one's for $20.  Well, that's what you have a job for, the pay bill. 
[00:33:00]  You work 10 hours a week.  No, I don't.  I'm up to 30.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Okay, that's all right.  It's almost full time.  All right, you get there.  It's almost full time.  No, I'm there.  Let me tell you, I'm there from 4.30 or 5 in the morning until around 12 or 1 in the  afternoon.  Okay.  Yeah.  You work in an eight hour day like everybody else, except for us.  Sorry.  Just about, you know.  All right.  You're putting in an honest day's work. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Why won't they give you full time?  Well, because it's only for management.  It's only for the ship's supervisors and management.  Why can't you be a manager?  You've been there for 10 years.  They don't want to pay our benefits.  All right.  I don't wish to be.  I would rather just be, you know, work there and have some responsibilities.  Responsibilities.  Wait.  Is that true with Starbucks that most of those people don't work full time?  Really?  So they don't have to give them benefits, I bet.  Yeah.  Right around 30 hours and that's it, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  Look, I got a 401k that they match and I got...  They match.  How much do they put in your 401k for you?  Well, I put 6% of my pay and they match it.  Last time it was like $32.50 or $30.50 and then they put the same amount and I'm up  to $5,000 in my 401.  All right.  In only two years I got that.  Two years?  She's got $5,000 for retirement. 
[00:34:30]  That's wonderful.  Let's do some math and see how long you'll live after retirement.  It's terrible.  I'll probably live a long time.  I take care of myself.  No.  What are you going to do with the $5,000, Patty?  That's...  Well, no.  That's going to get even higher because as long as I continue to work there, they'll  continue to contribute.  This is just for my final expenses.  I don't want to be a burden on Evie. 
[00:35:00]  So this is for my final expenses.  Not today, Patty.  Not today.  Oh, God.  That done commercial with the window.  Not today.  You know, for the nice box, the satin pillow.  Jesus.  Some people to carry me out.  Her numbers are exhausting.  Oh, they really is.  She has to pay $30,000 once for her $18,000 surgery.  $18,000 surgery now. 
[00:35:30]  And $32.50, the employer is matching.  I picture her in this dimly lit apartment with one of those visors on and an old adding  machine that she's going and pulling the handle when she does bills.  And it's all a bunch of, okay.  Actually, Anthony, I figured it out on my phone.  I have a calculator app.  A calculator?  Who has a calculator app?  By the way, another joke answered.  Of course.  You just have a calculator.  It's not.  What is the app part of the calculator? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, it's an app on my phone.  I could just go to the calculator on my phone.  Yeah, everyone has that.  I don't really call it an app.  It just comes with the phone.  It just comes with the phone.  Maybe officially it's an app, right?  I don't know.  It just comes with the phone.  Jesus.  Calculator.  I laugh because she loves her life.  It's just so weird to look at it, though.  You know what?  The fucking employers writing a $32 check for Patty's 401k. 
[00:36:30]  They match the 401k.  Know how they match the 401k?  They dump out the tip jar.  One hour of tips to take care of your 401k.  You do what, Patty?  On Mondays, I do the tips.  On Wednesdays, I put the delivery away, the big order that comes in.  What do you mean you do the tips?  What do you mean you do the tips?  Yeah, I, you know, figure them out and I give them out to the crew. 
[00:37:00]  I take the employee hours.  I divide the money into the employee hours.  I come to how much an hour?  You skimming?  Yeah, and then I just figure it out.  You skimming off the top?  Taking a little for yourself?  No.  Take a little taste?  You gotta take that taste, Patty.  Come on.  I don't do that.  I could wear 10 quarters in the fucking back pocket when no one's looking.  Yeah, I gotta be allowed to wet my beak.  Look at our no.  Can he hit the bell?  No.  Of course.  We have a lot of jokes being answered. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, these are my fellow workers.  I would never do that in a million years.  So how much do you skim, honestly?  The day is long.  How much do you skim?  Nothing.  You should at least take the pennies, because no one wants pennies.  Take the pennies.  The pennies add up.  Just take a few pennies.  The pennies really add up.  Yeah.  What do you mean the pennies add up?  Yeah.  Let me tell you, they really do add up.  But, you know, we get one, you add another one, it's two.  $1.35 an hour per person.  What? 
[00:38:00]  We average about $1.35 in my store.  In tips?  Just in tips.  $1.35?  Yeah, if a person works five hours, $1.35 times five.  I work 30, 30 times $1.35, you know, whatever.  And then I just put them in the envelope.  Oh, my God.  She's only making an extra $30 a week.  Oh, you write everything down?  Yeah.  Do you write it down and submit, like, a tax form?  Well, it's on our paychecks, and it's right on our W-2 form. 
[00:38:30]  It's on the paychecks, so you don't even get the actual cash for the tips?  No, no, no, no, no.  So out of the $1.35, they've got to pay tax on that?  The income is reported on the paychecks.  Oh, my God.  And it's also on the W-2 form.  Tips are supposed to be, you know, it's free money.  It's under the table.  We all went the other way.  The government knows that tips, schmips, you know, they know.  So they take that tip money at Starbucks. 
[00:39:00]  They take it, and then management just takes it, deposits it into the big deposit of Starbucks.  Right.  And then they write a check to each of the people.  It goes into their paycheck, like, as part of their pay.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  The money is separate from the paycheck.  They get cash.  But it's figured out on the paycheck.  Oh, it's on the paycheck.  So there's a record of it.  So at the end of the year, you've got to pay the taxes on the cash they gave you. 
[00:39:30]  How about you just turn the fucking jar over, divvy it up, and not talk to it?  I'd be shoving dollar bills in my pants all day long.  Yeah, keep it under your hat, Patty.  Right, Patty?  Every time someone turns their back, I would take another fucking couple dollars.  Patty.  Yeah.  And recently, there was controversy with Starbucks with the tips, right?  That's not our store.  Oh, hey, hey.  It has nothing to do with that store.  I think it was all Starbucks stores.  I don't even know where that store is, and I didn't pay much attention to it. 
[00:40:00]  Oh.  That everyone, everyone.  I don't understand that.  They work right, you know, supervisors work right alongside us and do the same work we do.  Do they?  They're just responsible for what's going on in the store.  That's all.  They just have to answer to a little more.  Just turn the jar over and take the tip money and don't tell anybody.  The only two people that do not get to miss the manager and the assistant.  Well, then they don't need to know about it.  You go with all the other employees.  You say, hey, here's what the tips were. 
[00:40:30]  Here's your envelope.  Let's, you know, let's not fucking say anything about this to management.  You've got to norma-ray this shit, Patty.  Patty, start unionizing.  Get that union going and fucking get a march going.  Patty, maybe you could distract the employer while the other guys are counting the tips.  Like, maybe you could, like, fake a stroke or something in the corner every day while they count the tip money.  Every day.  You get quite an imagination.  She's been doing a text.  What about the horse with the clock in its stomach? 
[00:41:00]  Wow.  Patty, where are you living these days?  And how much is rent?  Oh, I'm still in Staten Island.  I pay.  My share is, you know, I've been on Section 8 for over 12 years now.  It took me five years to get it.  Section 8.  And my share is like $400 a month.  So you've got to pay $400 a month.  You know, plus I pay two credit cards, a phone.  I have a cat. 
[00:41:30]  I've got to feed her.  I've got to feed me.  How is she paying $400 a month?  Oh, because the Section 8 gives you a check, right?  Well, no, the landlord gets the check.  I just pay the rest.  She pays $400 out of whatever it is.  So you have to work and pay $400 a month?  Yep.  That's got to be a lot out of your paycheck.  And I also have to pay $85 for the phone.  I pay my own con ed or my utilities.  All right.  How much?  I have to pay.  Okay.  We get how life works.  Let me ask you this.  I have to put the food in my mouth and chew it and swallow it or I die. 
[00:42:00]  By the way, I do not get food stamps.  I'm income ineligible.  You have pride, and I like that about you.  Patty, at the end of the week, how much money do you have to spend on yourself to have a little fun?  Maybe about $25 or so, or $20, you know, and that's, you know, I also get my car fare taken out of my check,  and I have a credit card that they wage work sends me, and I go to work that way.  So at the end of the week, you have $20 for yourself. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, exactly, and I just get something I like.  Right now, I'm paying for a DVD that I got from Fingerhut.  What, you're paying off a DVD?  I think that part of that $20 is at $13.99 a month.  It's just a little pleasure for myself.  A little pleasure for myself.  I love Patty's simple life.  It's so simple.  But she is as happy as, I don't know, Donald Trump, man.  I know.  There's no difference. 
[00:43:00]  It's a great thing.  What's the Fingerhut, did she say?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like a catalog you could get things out of.  All right, so what kind of DVD was it?  Well, I like Backstairs at the White House.  That's a four-part miniseries.  It's a great movie.  I didn't ask that.  I want to know about the DVD itself.  Oh, it's just a small thing.  You know, it's about 13 inches long, so it's small, and I could carry it in my book bag and look at it on the box and stuff. 
[00:43:30]  It's fun.  I'm having fun with it.  I hope some fucking homie just grabs it out of her hands.  She's having fun with it, so that's okay.  Okay, and how much did it cost?  It was $129, $130, so $13.99 a month for a few months.  $13?  She loves the monthly payment, man.  Anyway, Patty loves layaway and paying things off.  She loves paying things off.  There you go.  We're looking at your DVD player right now.  It looks terrific, Patty.  Good for you.  Patty, is it one day a month do you sit down and just hammer out all these bills? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, well, I do it every week.  I figure out what can I pay, you know, that sort of thing.  Are you on a budget?  I have to be, yeah.  You have a budget?  How much cash does your budget allow you to carry on your person per week?  She said $20.  So you got $20?  That's it.  Yeah, $20, $25 I can carry on. 
[00:44:30]  They need to pay for, you know, a cup of coffee at the ferry before getting on the boat, you know, things like that.  You get a coffee and it's like a quarter of your budget's gone for a cup of coffee.  You're weird.  Holy mother of fuck.  I'm getting stressed out.  I am fucking freaking out.  How could you live like that?  I had to decide, do I want the coffee in the roll or do I want to take the train? 
[00:45:00]  Maybe I can walk the 12 miles.  Well, I think you're doing okay, you know.  No, that's the beauty of you, Patty.  Patty.  You don't know any different.  Well, there was a question there that was good that you said something.  It's crazy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, her budget.  You actually have a budget?  Well, yeah.  People like me do who don't have a large income, you know.  We have to live within our means. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  Could you walk us through your budget quickly, like the basics of it?  Well, just very basic, you know.  After I pay my bills, I have a little money left over, you know.  And I just simply carry it around and just use it for things that I would like to have.  Or like the newspaper.  The newspaper?  Oh, no.  Patty, you get that online.  Patty, let's help your budget out.  You got the Samsung.  That's a nice phone. 
[00:46:00]  And you're paying the $80 a month.  You can get the newspaper shit on your phone.  Yeah.  The newspaper is like a day behind.  I know.  All right.  What else do you do with your $20 a week?  Well, the paper she uses to go to the bathroom on it.  You've got to get cat food with the $20.  If I keep a little bit of sight of it for a couple of months, I might go to the Empire and try my luck.  I went a couple times in March and did pretty good. 
[00:46:30]  She's throwing away her money at the Empire.  She's a gambling junkie.  But she said she did pretty good.  Patty!  Patty!  Jesus!  Patty!  Let us fucking...  Oh, but she's at the museum all the time.  She doesn't get to talk to real people very often.  Oh, fuck.  Patty, you said you did pretty good at the Empire.  Yeah, in March.  All right.  What does that mean?  How much did you win?  $200.  I thought I won a million.  You know?  And then I paid two credit cards with that. 
[00:47:00]  She won $200.  I paid my Capital One and paid my Premier Bank.  I love it!  You know, I had two payments.  I was like, wow, you know.  Capital One and my Premier Bank.  What do you owe to Capital One?  Oh, I use a credit card for some things like...  We know.  What's in your barren womb?  I like that.  That's a good one.  What's in your meat wallet?  Nothing.  People are really mad, too. 
[00:47:30]  This guy is Scott in Florida.  I got to get him on with Patty.  They're livid.  They're fucking livid.  Scott, go ahead.  Is this zilch saying that she spends 25% of her fuck you money on coffee and she works  at a coffee house? 
[00:48:00]  Yes!  Well, you know, when I go, you know, well, you know, sometimes I buy my coffee, too, in  other places.  It doesn't have to hold on.  But you can't afford to buy your own coffee.  So just, you know, take advantage of where you work.  I don't want to pilfer from the corporation.  Are you allowed to even have free coffee at Starbucks when you work in there?  Oh, yeah.  I have a latte every time I work.  I have a latte in the morning.  Cafe latte, Jerry.  I have a latte when I leave.  And I also like the carinelle ribbon crunch. 
[00:48:30]  I make one of those for myself almost every day.  You know, yeah.  But I'm also near my house, you know, so near a Starbucks is two miles away.  Why would I walk there?  If I'm going shopping and I want to have a little coffee.  Oh, my God.  All right.  You explained the coffee thing.  We get it.  How much do you owe on a credit card?  You never answered that question.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have two credit cards.  How much?  No.  How much?  They have very low limits.  One's a $500 limit. 
[00:49:00]  The other one is $250.  But it's a start.  I never had credit before.  So how much do you owe on those two credit cards right now?  How much?  Not much.  Maybe $600 on one and $450 on the other.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.  You said the limit was $500 and $250.  How do you?  I went over.  Oh, no.  Oh, Patty.  College girl.  Patty.  Patty's life is a microcosm of everyone's life. 
[00:49:30]  Like, it's a smaller version.  She's in debt with credit over her head.  She's got all these bills.  She's got to work.  Her budget is, it's all the same as everyone else's life.  Right.  But it's this tiny little version of it.  One thing I'm wondering about is how is Lady Di surviving without employment?  She sucks cock for money.  Yeah.  The guy she's living with, she blows him.  He comes in her face and gives her a place to live and some food. 
[00:50:00]  And she got some money from her dead father's inheritance that she's spending willy nilly.  And if you did that, you would have an endless supply of coffee.  Right.  Yeah, told me in the behind so I could feed my cat.  One in the shitter so I could afford a new hat.  You know, one thing for sure, you know, her son works at a library and she could go and 
[00:50:30]  ask him for a computer and he could set her up and help her look for a job on the computer  and show her.  Why would she help him?  Why would he help her when she's done nothing for him?  Yeah.  Abandoned him pretty much.  I know.  I know.  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  Of course you do, Patty.  Patty, you rule.  We love you, Patty.  Yes, Patty.  You are fantastic.  Hold on.  This guy wants to talk about his monthly bills.  Brian in Pennsylvania.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Yeah, I'm currently renting some silverware for 15 bucks a month. 
[00:51:00]  Rent-a-center?  I'm paying off a toothbrush for five bucks a month.  That's about it.  I think I'm doing pretty well compared to Patty.  This is what she finds funny.  This is what she finds funny.  She loves a good comedy bit.  Anthony throws out a brilliant meat wallet line.  It gets a zero from Patty.  This guy overpays for a toothbrush by 2,000%.  She's fucking like she's watching Laurel and Hardy. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  She's just out of her mind with laughter.  Patty, what are the minimum payments on your credit card every month?  Minimum $25, $35 a month around there.  All this seems to add up to more than she makes.  Yeah, of course.  Like, like...  Well, she gets the, uh, the, what is it, Section 8 or...  Do you get, do you get a check from, uh, the government?  No, I don't get anything.  I just, I just pay the $400 and the rest of the money...  So she's got to pay $400 rent.  And she's got all these little fucking $30, $20 shit like that that, uh... 
[00:52:00]  How much, how much is your take home a week?  Um, last week I took home, uh, $207.  Holy shit.  So, like, two weeks pay just does the rent.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  She said $20 a week she gets.  Well, a lot of deductions come out.  You know, I get a lot of deductions out, plus I'm paying out a loan that I took out from my 401 last year.  You took a loan out from your 401k? 
[00:52:30]  For what?  Yeah, because I was a little behind in the rent, so I covered it with that, and, uh...  Oh, my God.  She's just juggling.  She's juggling.  She's just juggling change.  She's spinning plates, juggling, just trying to, trying to stay ahead, and she's on a fucking treadmill pushing her back.  But it's all just very low numbers.  I'm running as fast as I can.  Running to stand still.  Yes, Patty, Patty.  Patty, Patty, how much was the loan for that you took out? 
[00:53:00]  Uh, well, I took out, like, uh, about $1,800 or something like that.  $1,800.  Like, uh, in the early part of 2011, I had some, you know...  Yeah, yeah.  And what's the...  I took care of it.  I took everything down.  All right, Patty.  Patty, what's the monthly payment on your loan?  Monthly?  Well, actually, it's a $200 a month.  They take $50 a week out.  They take $50 a week out of that.  I'm, I'm really, I'm not doing all the math here. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  But she can't possibly even have $20 left for her pocket a week.  You know, I want to get it paid off as fast as possible.  Good for you.  You know.  Do you feed your cat?  I don't want that over me.  How do you feed your cat with the $20 a week?  Do you fight over the cat food?  They're about, well, the cans of food are about $0.38 a month in the supermarket because  I'm in the pet club.  There's always a gem. 
[00:54:00]  There's always some little gem.  What's the pet club, Patty?  And wait, how much is the food for the cat again?  I get about 10, 12 cans a week, you know, for her.  And I get her a box of dry food.  And I supplement that with it.  All right.  But how much does that cost?  I think that may be 12 bucks a week.  12 bucks a week?  Out of your $20?  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  So now you're down to eight bucks a week?  Eight bucks and then five for a cup of coffee?  That cat would be a fucking wild cat.  Right?  That's why when you went to $200.  I would throw the cat out the fucking window.  I feel like a queen.  That's why when you went to $100 one time, you feel like a queen.  Yeah.  But what happens when you lose all the rest of the times?  Right.  Well, I don't go that often.  So I don't even know.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  All right.  But Patty, Ann had a good question there.  What do you get by joining the pet club? 
[00:55:00]  You get $5 off your order when you reach $50.  When you reach $50, so, oh, my God.  Life is difficult.  This guy's, hold on.  Glenn in Boston.  Go ahead, Glenn.  Good morning, boys.  I love the entertainment value.  You should, Brooks, you ought to fucking pitch in and give this bitch $3,000.  After all the years of entertainment that she's given you guys and provided us listeners out here, 
[00:55:30]  Patty's wonderful.  You guys should pitch in and give her a hand.  How about you pitching?  I will.  I'll give her $100.  Patty, have we taken care of you over the years?  Yes, you have.  All right.  I know you guys.  Okay.  She hasn't been in in a while.  She's got to earn her keep around this joint.  Every time she comes in, we're fucking dishing out money to her.  Actually, Colin Quinn brought up a stalker Patty bid yesterday, the mousetrap thing.  Was it him or Bill Burr brought that up?  Or was it Bill Burr?  Yeah, I think it was Bill. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, okay.  It was Bill.  Sorry.  That was a lot of fun.  You want to do that again?  Yeah.  It was kind of weird.  I was blindfolded and everything.  She's too fucking frail now to do anything.  That's why it would be fun.  I wouldn't do it.  Her shoulder to snap off.  I know, right?  She gets her finger caught in a mousetrap.  It goes flying across the room.  Her finger, not the trap.  Now that she's all...  It's all brittle.  I think...  Wasn't she naked for her, too?  She was naked.  We had a fucking...  Oh, God.  We were just horrible people.  She was naked.  With a fucking... 
[00:56:30]  Like, I think a homie...  No, it wasn't homie the clown.  It was fucking...  Rusty the Clown.  Rusty the Clown mask on.  He rocked you.  Crawling around naked.  Do you have a...  Do you have a...  Do you have a...  Do you have a clip of that?  I need to hear.  Let me see if I do.  Wear a bunch of douchebags.  What a fucking bunch of tools.  Patty, come in and redo the mousetrap thing.  You don't have to be naked, though.  Yeah.  What do you say?  We'll do it with bear traps.  All right.  On a future Friday.  Okay.  Future Friday.  Future Friday.  How about next week? 
[00:57:00]  I think we're off next week.  Yeah.  We're off.  Oh, okay.  So...  How about a week when you're not off?  Obviously.  Yeah.  Well, she liked that.  She liked that one, Jimmy.  She liked that.  Home run.  Home run, Chipperson.  You can make a lot of money if you kind of do the mouse.  Trap thing again.  Yeah, it's true, Patty.  Well, all right.  I'll do it.  It was kind of fun the first time.  She's so frail, though, now.  Remember the last time she walked in? 
[00:57:30]  She just...  How's your fucking heart valve thing?  Actually, I haven't had much problem with it.  They actually took me off the medication.  Medication.  Good thing.  I was taking Diavon tablets, but I don't need them now.  Yeah, right.  How about some cyanide tablets?  What's going on?  What's going on?  Our guests have all...  Oh, no.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  The summer camp office has gone to a whole new level.  Oh, is it?  Are they just babbling at each other in there?  Yeah, they're at summer camp.  And they're all getting to know Jackie. 
[00:58:00]  Oh.  He's stuck in the office with them.  Do they just love her, though?  They do.  I bet, like...  I was just thinking Marion's probably just like,  Oh, my.  She's so sweet.  Well, I asked Bobo just now.  I said, Bobo, this is...  Oh, no.  I forgot.  This is the first time you're meeting Jackie.  Oh, boy.  You know, what do you think?  As in, like, you know, is she a nice person or whatever?  And he's going, Oh, she looks good.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's going to be all, like, fucking getting boner and stuff.  Jackie just awkwardly goes, Thank you, Bobo.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:58:30]  Well, Patty was the pre-show, but Patty certainly delivered today.  Patty did a great job.  Hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  Rick in Tennessee has something for you.  Rick?  Hey, boys.  What's going on today?  Hey, Rick.  What's up?  Hey, I want to know how Patty is going to budget her $18,000 hospital bill on living on 27 cents a week.  It's terrible.  It's...  We'll figure it out, though.  We'll figure it out.  And then she just skips through life.  That's the American way.  All right, we'll just figure it out, right, Patty? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, figure it out.  Figure something out.  Have a calculator.  But, Rick, you want to say that there was something really sad about Patty.  I don't think so, sir.  She loves her life, right, Patty?  Yes, I do.  Yeah, she's great.  All right.  Bye, Patty.  Oh, hold on.  We got the mousetrap clip.  Patty, you're going to have to try to stay quiet for about a minute here, okay?  Good luck.  Yes, okay.  All right.  You're on.  This clip has Bill Burr and Patrice in it.  Another Patrice pin, of course. 
[00:59:30]  Fuck.  Here's a sample.  That was not the check.  Oh, this is so...  You sound like a chimp.  You can't do that.  Yeah, that's definitely a Trayvon.  You're almost there.  $3,000 on the...  Oh, my God.  That hit me.  That hit me.  My finger.  That's what it's supposed to do.  Hey, if you were a mouse, you'd be dead.  Come on.  Keep crawling. 
[01:00:00]  Fucking Burr.  If you were a mouse, you'd be dead.  Wow.  We got to start doing bits again.  It's just time.  Yeah, but we got to fucking circulate some fresh blood in here.  True.  Patty's like fucking, you know...  We could break her out for old-timers' day.  Our pace is too much.  We got to break out the new...  Old-timers' day, you think?  We'll have old-timers' day.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock, that's the only clip...  I need clips all day now.  All right, I'll look for more, but that's the first one I pulled.  All right, that was funny, man. 
[01:00:30]  She's going to come apart like she looked at fucking Medusa.  You don't want...  I don't think we could have her calling around in mousetraps anymore.  No, no, that's just it.  She screamed like that, like, six, seven years ago?  She can't do that now.  Exactly, you made my cock hard then.  Imagine what I'm going to do now.  Oh, Patty.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  So good to get a little Patty update, though, right?  Yeah, this sounds a little weird, but maybe next time you come in here,  I'll just give you the money, and you don't have to work for it.  You've made thousands of dollars off us, though, Patty.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Did you send in a tax form?  Because we...  Yeah, we did.  We're going to tell the government.  We're going to tell the government you didn't pay taxes.  Imagine turning her in.  Well, my IRS bill per month now is another 5840, so I penciled that in.  Do you think she has a wallet just filled with cards, nonsense cards?  Just nonsense stuff.  Here's my pet club card.  I'm part of the pet club, and then here's my fucking Hello Kitty veterinarian thing. 
[01:01:30]  What is it?  Can you run through the cards that you have, and then we'll let you go?  The cards?  Okay.  Let me go to my purse.  Oh, this is okay.  I have a lot of supermarket cards.  A lot of supermarket cards.  As you go...  When you're at CVS and they go, do you have a CVS card?  Yeah, wait a minute.  Go get your wallet.  We got another clip from the mousetrap day.  Okay.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  If you don't find the checks by the end of the show, then they stay on the floor until  tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  That was the back of the hand. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, my God.  I just got the palm of my hand.  She's going to have to give the teller the check with her mouth.  You're mean.  Patty, we're running out of show.  Come on, Patty.  Running out of show.  All your problems could go away.  This was terrible.  I built a piece of paper.  Do I have a check?  We are despicable human beings.  She was younger back then.  Come on.  Not much younger. 
[01:02:30]  Not much younger.  A-A-R-P eligible.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, God.  She was 51 when this happened.  Why are we doing bits anymore?  What's wrong with us?  Seven years ago.  That's hilarious.  Fucking Patrice was the best.  Well, perhaps because this floor could fit three mousetraps on it.  Exactly.  She could just put one hand out and have the check and both mousetraps.  All right, Patty, you got your wallet with all your cards?  Yeah, I got all my supermarket cards.  I got Food Town.  I got Pathmark Advantage Club. 
[01:03:00]  I got Key Food.  I got D'Agostino's, Food Emporium, and Gristidi's.  Okay.  Yeah.  I love it.  She's just pulling them out.  Keep going.  And then I also got the Dwayne Reed card.  Ah.  And I got the extra care from CVS.  Extra care?  What do you get with the extra care?  It's a card.  It's just a card.  Every time they ask me if I have a CVS card, I'm like, no!  I get so mad.  I'm like, just fucking ring me up. 
[01:03:30]  You save money if something's on you.  And then not only do I say no, just ring the fucking thing up.  When they give me change, any kind of coin change, I put it on top of whatever medicine is in the aisle as I'm walking out of the store.  Because I don't want the change scratching the phone in my pocket.  That's how I live, Patty.  You're rich.  Well, I have a change purse.  I don't have to worry about that.  Oh, jeez.  Between your legs.  Any other cards, Patty?  Any other cards? 
[01:04:00]  No, those are all my cards.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  Someone did the math that we decided we didn't feel like doing.  Go ahead, Eric in Jersey.  You're a star today, Eric, for doing a little math.  At $30 a month, $18,000 will take 50 years to pay off.  So, Patty.  Do you have that in you, Patty?  At 108 years old.  Actually, I would say, wouldn't it be 60 years to get to the $18,000?  No.  Yeah, Patty.  Oh, yeah, $12. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, boy.  Charity.  Good luck, Patty.  Good luck.  Wait, $30?  All right, Patty.  $30 a month for 12 months.  So, that's, what?  $36?  $360 a year?  Right?  Something like that.  But I'll also get part of the $360 a year.  $360 a year.  Here in the social services, they'll figure out, you know, a program in the hospital itself  to help me out. 
[01:05:00]  So, every three years, you get a little over $1,000.  You know.  Well, you know, see what happens when I meet with him.  Yeah, he's about right.  Between 50 and 52 years.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he was right.  It's crazy.  More or less.  Well, I guess I'll be dead by the time it's gone.  Now, hold on, Patty.  We found another mouse trap clip from that lovely day.  You got to remember, she had a mask on and she was completely naked.  $1,000.  $1,000.  Oh!  Oh!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[01:05:30]  Ow!  It's my palm, my knuckles!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  My fingers!  Ow!  My fingers!  My palm, my knuckles!  Fuck, man!  I can't even say that!  Oh my god!  I got my teeth!  I don't know!  Just slap the floor.  Just get it over with.  Ow!  Did you do that on purpose?  No, no!  None of it.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I'm almost forgetting she's naked. 
[01:06:00]  You pushed that toward me and you know it.  You pushed that toward me.  I know you did.  Oh, Patty, relax.  Oh, that's old Patty.  Oh, yeah.  Got current Patty on the phone.  Oh, my God.  That was crazy.  You delivered, Patty.  Yep.  Your tombstone will say you delivered.  Yeah.  Three-pack memories.  Brings back memories.  And you're another one of these people where your life has barely changed in all these years. 
[01:06:30]  Just like Lady Dies.  Oh, boy.  At least she's, you know, working.  I have a job and I work.  Nice.  No freeloader.  Smack talking.  You have to live in front of a TV set.  Exactly.  You know, you just turn off the TV and get out and look for a place to work.  Right.  There's a time and place for TV and a time and place for working.  A time and place for fucking diddling your decrepit clit to Paul McCartney. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  That was in this phone call, too.  Yes.  All right, Patty.  I think that's it.  Good luck with the cat thing today.  Sure.  You have a good day, guys.  Sure.  You stay in touch.  And don't fall for any of their scams.  Right.  Say, look, the postcard said a free visit.  I'm here for my free visit and that is it.  Don't let them sell you some shit.  Right.  Oh, don't worry.  That'll be the case.  I'm here for my free visit and that is it.  All right.  All right, Patty.  Thank you, Patty.  All right.  Come see us soon, Patty.  See you later.  Bye-bye. 
[01:07:30]  Fans, the fans love her, man.  They protect her, too.  She's fantastic.  They stick up for Patty.  You know what?  You got to give it to her.  She's fucking, you know, she's out there hustling, hustling.  She's fucking hustling.  I can't get enough of her, though.  She's great.  There's always some weird little thing.  I love the little thing she just throws in.  Well, I'm in the pet club.  Oh, my gosh.  Should I take out a loan from her 401k?  From the five grand and her 401k.  It's just, it's so, it's just, you know. 
[01:08:00]  Let me see how to, Keith and Long Island.  We're on Long Island.  Keith, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's doing, boys?  Hey, man.  The radio off.  There we go.  You guys got to stop playing the mousetrap bit, man.  I got to drive from Suffolk County to Queens.  This is just too much, man.  I've been a fan for 10 years and I never heard the bit before.  Oh, man.  You know what?  That's why we have the Opie and Anthony podcast.  Yes, because we just don't really have time to play a lot of the old stuff.  So, in the very near future, we'll put that up on the podcast. 
[01:08:30]  That would be a good addition.  Oh, my God.  Yo, thanks, boys.  All right.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  Yeah, let's do that.  Let's get the mousetrap bit on the Opie and Anthony podcast in a couple weeks.  What a pisser, that one.  Speaking of which, this week's podcast, it's Max Cook doing the Tony Soprano thing.  Sure.  Talking from the grave while he was on Ambien.  It was a really strange phone call.  We got Tony Danza fucking around with the Tony Danza line.  All the people trying to get into his show. 
[01:09:00]  That's no longer around, obviously.  Yeah.  That's a bit we haven't played in fucking five or six years.  It was easy.  And then we got the Dave Rabbit tapes.  From the NAM.  From the NAM, a DJ that did his thing during Vietnam.  Fucking fascinating clips.  Very cool.  And those are two out of the three bits are stuff we just can't play anymore.  You know, it's just tough.  And now we'll put the mousetrap bit up there in a future episode.  Indeed.  Opie and Anthony podcast number seven is available, so go get it. 
[01:09:30]  I'm going to eat.  Yeah, let's eat.  Yeah.  Are they just babbling?  Oh, my God.  It's got to be.  I mean, you will have an idea because you're going to be in the room with them.  Yeah.  But there's just so much idiocy going on.  Idiocy?  Like what?  Give me an example.  It's just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, I can only imagine that.  I mean, like, Marion and Di, you know, they haven't met a lot of us.  Like, they met me, like, eight years ago, but they don't remember.  You know, they're meeting Troy.  Oh.  And, you know, Troy's hitting on Marion. 
[01:10:00]  Oh.  Oh, God.  I bring Di to the bathroom, and she's hacking up a lung, like, ah.  How do they look?  They look great, Opie.  Do they look different than the pictures?  Marion's lost some weight.  Oh.  She lost weight last time.  She'll tell us that, too.  Di's got an eye thing going on where it's, like, half closed.  Oh, no.  Bobo's a billboard for the Mets.  It's just, this is going to be the best show ever. 
[01:10:30]  What a bunch of fucking retards we have.  Jim doesn't look happy at all.  This is why I hated that movie, Dinner with Schmucks.  Was that the time?  Yeah, Dinner with the Schmucks.  Because I'm like, no, this is how you do it.  This is Breakfast with the Schmucks.  Right.  This is how you do it, for real.  This is going to be a great show.  You sure?  How do we do this, you think?  We get them all in one?  No, no, no, no, no.  I think you bring Di and Marion in first.  Because you haven't talked to Marion in years.  That's true.  You don't want Bobo to just be babbling.  Oh, he'll just be rambling on. 
[01:11:00]  Ramble every fucking thing.  Jimmy.  And if you guys, it might be a little too early to drink, but maybe for the replay.  Maybe we've got some people listening to this on the replay now.  A perfect opportunity for a drinking game.  Every time one of these dummies answers a joke, you fucking take a swig.  Drink a bullet.  And then poor Jackie's in there.  Is she laughing?  She thinks they're all sweet and adorable.  Oh, of course she does.  Good for her.  Jackie's just a saint on her. 
[01:11:30]  Roland is ready to kill himself.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  I can see Roland not enjoying it.  Yeah, Roland has no patience for these people.  Why?  I don't know.  Roland's not like me and Sam.  Sam and I really love this.  I love it.  Yeah.  It's the best.  Roland and Sal just want to kill themselves.  Why Sal?  Because they're both fighting certain realities about themselves.  I think we're going to have a question.  Why wouldn't you find the joy in this?  I don't know.  I find the joy in it.  I can't get the smile off my face. 
[01:12:00]  Yes, sir.  I'm ready.  And the Patty phone call was a nice extra bonus today.  I thought that was going to be quick.  Yes, sir.  The Patty updates are always terrific.  Yes, sir.  There's always...  She goes to the Apple store to play with the gadgets.  And that's a big day for her.  Yeah.  Patty is a very simple woman.  Yes, Sam.  Yeah.  Now Sam's laughing.  What's up?  How can you not?  Roland is fucking furious.  Why?  Now he knows what we all have to deal with with him.  Because...  Well, I don't think we... 
[01:12:30]  And his shenanigans.  ...pack his office full of the dregs of society.  Really?  Yeah, I mean, he's sitting there like...  Because he had to get them all the sign releases.  They're all in his office.  He's actually...  He left his own office.  He's sitting by himself.  He left his own office.  Is he in our office?  He's in our office, sitting by himself, trying to eat his breakfast.  He's furious that all those people are in there.  Really?  Furious.  Are they all keeping quiet?  No.  None of them are keeping quiet.  And he told me that if he had a gun, there would be a massacre. 
[01:13:00]  Jesus.  Right now.  All right.  So up next...  Jim, are you excited?  Great.  I want to see them again, but...  Marion and Di are great.  It's going to be exhausting.  I can't wait.  Yeah.  So Lady Di and Marion, the first time in, I don't know...  Thank you, Kenny.  Many, many years.  Seven years?  Seven years in studio?  I would say, yeah.  Okay.  We probably haven't seen Marion...  We've seen her one time since NAW, I guess.  I think that was that one time they came in at XM.  Wow.  Prepare for a lot of memories to come immediately flashing back. 
[01:13:30]  Ah, good.  I love it.  Is this bit going to feel very familiar?  Oh, just a tad.  Are they listening to us right now?  I mean, the audio is playing, but...  Let's make a list.  This is the things you're about to hear.  It really is like riding a bike.  You're right, Sam.  Like, the second they walked in, I was like, oh...  Oh, I know how to do this.  Let's start with Marion.  What is she going to tell us?  That she lost weight.  Don't I look good?  Hi, guys. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, I lost weight.  How you doing?  How you doing?  She'll ask us all how we're doing.  Yeah, how are you?  How are you, Anthony?  You thinking she'll bring up things from a long time ago that, like, she'll ask us about?  I guess.  She'll say, you guys look great.  Like, she would say something like, Anthony, how's Melinda?  How's Melinda doing?  How's the baby?  I'll get, how's the baby?  Right, right, right, right.  That type of thing.  The mashup got to meet them.  Oh. 
[01:14:30]  Stan said, these are your listeners, huh, Sam?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  The mashup walked in, and Stanley T was being polite and said hi to everybody.  And Marion said, who's this basketball player?  Oh, my God.  That's her.  That's her.  Holy shit.  All right, man.  She's the worst.  Hope everyone got plenty of sleep last night, because it's going to get very exhausting.  Oh.  The return of Lady Diane Marion is next. 
[01:15:00]  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no.  I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cup right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty. 
[01:15:30]  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the TF thing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite floral treats.  My favorite eating cock.  I'm hungry for a big fat juicy cock.  After I whack your bag. 
[01:16:00]  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Do your big wad of cum right into my mouth.  Oh.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty.  Patty, Patty.  Oh, God.  After I suck you off, I want you to bang me up the ass.  I'm hungry for a hard-nailed cock. 
[01:16:30]  Yes.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big juicy cock from Ben the other day.  Oh.  I like the bananas.  Oh, God.  I like the bananas.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with the guy.  I enjoy hoffing my mouth.  I enjoy hoffing between the boobs.  I enjoy hoffing my tight ass.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty. 
[01:17:00]  She's a freak.  Patty, Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  She's a freak.  And Anthony's show.  You'll be the three show.  Continues.  All right.  David Bowie released fame 38 years ago. 
[01:17:30]  Whatever.  We got Colin Quinn in studio.  And I just tweeted the first video of Lady Di and Marion.  It's so classic.  This is the first time I've seen Marion in eight.  Well, both of them.  The first time I've seen him in eight years.  And I did a quick video.  Go to my Twitter, OP Radio.  It's right there for your viewing pleasure.  Yeah, I think it came out great.  I just shoved the camera in their face.  How awful is that?  And then when Lady Di goes, goes, how you doing, hon?  Like one of the fucking, like a beehive hair waitress at a diner. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  How you doing, hon?  I'll play the audio.  Oh.  How you doing?  Hi, how are you?  How you been?  How you doing, hon?  What can I get?  You got the coffee?  Hey, what do you think?  She's showing off a figure.  Hey, what do you think?  I'm a hubba.  Hey, what do you think?  The camera pans down.  I'm a huge fan of Instagram video, man.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Huge fucking fan.  15 seconds.  Thank you, Instagram.  Thank you. 
[01:18:30]  It almost sounded like a female, like a Three Stooges at the beginning.  Yes, yes.  Hi.  Hey, how are you?  Hi, how are you?  Hey, good morning, everyone.  I just saw it during the break.  I just had to.  I walked down the hall, and I just shoved my camera.  I didn't even say anything.  I just said I pushed record and play, and I hear Colin in the background having the time of his life.  Oh, yeah.  Colin was back there.  As Roland is mad, Sal's mad, and there's Colin just in the mix, just loving life.  Oh, it was so great to see him.  You're having a ball over here.  Chatting it up.  Just chatting it up with Bobo.  Well, Bobo, I have an interesting proposition. 
[01:19:00]  You know, he's a big Mets fan.  I don't know if he's made that clear.  Although he has.  And so is a good friend of mine, Jerry Seinfeld.  Yes.  So I was kind of telling Bobo, I said, you know, Jerry's a friend of mine.  He's a big Mets fan, too.  He goes, oh, who's the one?  And his eyes just locked in.  He goes, I always wanted to go to the All-Star game.  I go, oh.  Of course.  Something free he thinks he's going to get.  I was like, you know, Jerry always has good tickets, too.  He's like, yeah.  A minute later, he's like, every year, my whole life, I go, is it going to be in Flushing this year? 
[01:19:30]  I go, what is it going to be in Flushing?  The All-Star game.  I go, oh.  And it's there this year?  Yeah.  It's there.  I said, wow.  Sounds like a match made in heaven.  Well, Jerry, now, it's not like you won't get 8,000 tweets a day asking, Carl, did you  talk to Jerry about the All-Star tickets?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  So does it look like Jerry might swing this?  I mean, I can't just guarantee it because it's his tickets.  Sure, sure.  I would say.  Oh, good chance.  I'd say like 80%, 85%. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, nice.  Okay.  For a strong possibility.  Yes.  And you would say Jerry could use, you know, a few more friends, I guess.  Yes.  Regular people.  Use the company.  Not show business friends.  And Bobo would probably be a good guy.  They would click, I bet.  Yes, they would.  Yeah, yeah.  Casey Liu, too, on Instagram, I guess.  She looks like the lady from Throw Mama from the Train.  I know.  People have said that over the years.  Lady Di really does.  Yeah, but now more than ever.  Why put this off any longer?  Yes, exactly.  She looked like her.  She just bring that urge out. 
[01:20:30]  She should be in Throw Mama from the Path Train.  And Colin rearranged his whole schedule to be here.  Yes, I did.  Jesus, what's wrong with you?  Yes.  I'm doing a couple of things at like 1130.  Yeah.  Just because I wanted to do this.  Colin had a great idea, too.  He should have thought of this.  Hook all of them up with GoPro cams.  Nice.  On them so you could get a moron eye view of everything.  Edit it together.  That would be wonderful footage.  Marion looks exactly the same.  She walks down the hall.  Look at her.  She's a little troll.  Look, she's rocking back and forth, walking like a troll. 
[01:21:00]  Let's get retarded in here.  Oh, my goodness.  Hi, Marion.  How are you?  Thank you very much.  Oh, thank you.  This is great.  Hey, how are you?  Oh, my God.  It's what I want to do.  Hi, Howard.  You look great.  How are you?  Everyone's looking great.  I got my headphones on and stuff. 
[01:21:30]  You know how it is.  I got my headphones on.  Get by a microphone, ladies.  Get by the microphones.  Oh, boy.  Watch the wires.  Watch the wires.  Watch the wires.  Watch the wires.  This is why we don't hang together.  You don't hang together. 
[01:22:00]  She's wearing Pacino's glasses from fucking Donnie Brasco.  Catch her to prick.  I've had these glasses for a long, long time.  You're not talking about your glasses.  Look at Don's glasses and crooked.  Marion's glasses.  What about mine?  What about my glasses?  Well, that's what he's talking about.  Your glasses look like Pacino's glasses in Donnie Brasco.  Yes.  Yes.  They're kind of tinted, yellow.  Very nice.  I just got them.  What do mine look like?  You look like John Pernette.  Yours are crooked. 
[01:22:30]  Yours are crooked on your head.  Well, that's because I got the headphones on.  I got the headphones on.  Uh-huh.  Talking to the microphone.  I got the headphones on.  Hey, guys.  How you been?  Look at her.  Look at her one headphone.  It's hanging off the side.  It's all, fix her headphones, someone.  Jesus, yes.  Look at it.  It's all backwards.  And that fucking Andy Gibb haircut.  Can you fix her Andy Gibb?  I can't.  She's had the same hairdo for 15 years.  Hey, Paul Williams.  All right.  Not me. 
[01:23:00]  You're Paul Williams, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Ladies, I got to say welcome back.  It's been so long.  It's been so long.  Why don't we start with this?  Marion, what have you been up to for the last seven years?  We haven't talked to you in a long time.  I sold my house, me and my husband.  We got an apartment and a brand new two-family house.  Now, why'd you do that?  Because we felt like selling the house because it was too big for us.  How long ago did you sell it?  Did you make money or were you underwater?  No, no.  I made money.  All right.  I've done two cruises a year.  I've done six cruises in the last two years. 
[01:23:30]  Six cruises?  What cruise line are you going on?  Well, two years.  Royal Caribbean.  Royal Caribbean.  It's fantastic.  Good, right?  Fuck Carnival, right?  And another thing.  I got another one coming up in November.  Now, you're going on cruises and Lady Di, not quite so much.  No.  You're going on cruises, but they're in cars.  Yeah, she's cruising.  No.  There you go.  Answering the joke.  And also, I joined the gym and I lost a lot of weight.  Yes.  You looked lovely.  Go to the gym.  Go to the gym eating butter.  Eating butter.  No, I don't eat at the gym.  Eating butter.  What?  I don't eat at the gym. 
[01:24:00]  This is what I take with me.  Water.  Wait, that's after seven.  Hold on.  Hold on.  After seven years, that's all you got is an update?  You go on cruises and you sold your house?  I'm doing pretty good.  I exercise more.  I'm still working.  My husband retired.  Oh, he did?  Everything else is good.  So, he's around the house all the time now?  No, no.  He works part-time.  How is he having to get a job?  Di said there's no work out there.  There's work.  There's work.  If you look for it and you go bust your tail, that's how you get work.  Oh, thank you, Jackie.  Oh, thank you, Jackie.  You guys look at it right where I like it. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  Perfect placement.  I'm jamming your blueberries.  Thank you.  You've got to hear about that all the time.  Blueberries.  Yeah.  This is ridiculous.  Oh, she's right.  It is crazy.  Blueberries are good for you.  So is strawberries.  Yep.  Strawberries are good, too, Jim.  Why do you always have blueberries?  I don't know.  I just apparently, I like things with S's in them.  Thank you, Marion.  Jim, you look really good, though.  You lost a ton of weight.  Thank you very much.  Opie and Anthony, you guys look good, too.  Thank you.  Opie, congratulations on your children.  There it is.  There it is.  Thank you.  That's taking care. 
[01:25:00]  New dad?  Yes.  Anthony, anything new to you?  Not so new anymore, but...  He says, trying to get the pool ready.  You ever get the pool going?  Yeah, yeah.  The pool's fine, fine.  When are we coming over?  Yes.  Oh, man.  When are we coming over for the pool?  Next party, I think they should be there.  This weekend.  What do you think?  Firstly, me.  What do you guys got going on 4th of July?  I'm going to be down the shore for a week.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, suicide.  What about...  Oh, for the weekend?  Yeah, for the weekend.  Oh, okay.  We're going to be barbecuing in the backyard.  Wait a minute.  Who's we?  Yeah.  Well, my roommate and I. 
[01:25:30]  Well, why don't you go to Anthony's for the big 4th of July party?  Yeah.  Okay, if he wants to invite us, give us a, you know...  Oh, boy.  Well, not me.  He's inviting you now.  Not me.  I got a hotel room in Seaside.  Okay.  Oh, look at her.  I got a hotel room in Seaside.  Seaside.  What about the Labor Day party?  Living large.  Yeah, what about the big Labor Day party, maybe?  Labor Day?  Yeah, I could do Labor Day.  All right, let's bank on that, then.  Yeah.  The Labor Day party.  As long as the pool's open.  Oh, Di, of course.  You'll be there for this week.  And Anthony, I don't drink beer no more.  Why?  What happened?  Because you get bloated. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, my God.  She pointed at Lady Di as she said that.  You do.  You got to, like, I told her to start drinking.  I drink wine with club soda if I do drink.  Why did you point at Lady Di when you said bloated?  Because you get, like, you get, like, that little bloated.  You got to drink.  Are you saying she's bloated?  Well, from the beer, beer bloats you up.  Did you take her to the gym with you?  Yeah.  I want her to go to the gym with me.  Oh, my God.  What?  No, no, nothing, nothing.  You went from Oliver Hardy to W.C. Fields.  Oh, yay! 
[01:26:30]  I knew someone was going to make fun of that.  Well, they always did, Diane.  Well, I don't go for the weight jokes anymore.  It's not, you don't really weigh, you don't really weigh any much more than you did.  She's skinny fat.  Hey, what do you think about me?  I've lost maybe about 10 pounds.  You look exactly the same, Maryam, but good for you.  No, I don't.  She's lost a ton of weight.  But you're a ton of weight.  Yeah.  You've kept the weight off for a long time now.  Yeah, thank you.  What do you think your friend, Lady Di, her life is a little weird right now.  She's got to straighten up.  I keep telling her that, but... 
[01:27:00]  I realize that.  I already know.  Seven years ago.  This is the same conversation these two of us.  Honestly, honestly, I'm telling you, I tell her we got to get out.  I live eight blocks from her.  Oh, boy.  Diane, I'll walk over.  We'll go for a walk.  No, no.  Maybe later.  She watches TV.  That's all you do is watch TV.  That's the bad thing to sit in front of a TV all day.  Yes, yes.  You can learn a lot by watching TV.  That's true.  But, Diana...  What have you learned?  I tell you...  Hold on, Maryam.  Maryam, hold on, hold on. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, what have you learned from watching TV?  Right.  I like to watch Married with Children.  Uh-huh.  What do you learn from that?  So what do you learn?  I usually start out watching that.  And then Good Morning America.  Oh.  You know, get in touch with the latest news.  Latest.  And then the game shows that come on.  So you learn from the game shows.  That's where you learn facts on game shows.  Wait, so what...  Jeopardy?  Sometimes you learn from game shows.  Jeopardy?  No, not Jeopardy, though.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Fucking...  Go on Wheel of Fortune.  No, not even Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy. 
[01:28:00]  It's those game shows that are so easy.  You know the one where it's like...  Password.  He was the first president of the United States.  His name is George Washington.  Ten.  Oh, yeah.  The Price is Right.  You get it.  The Price...  You can learn Price is Right.  Matter of fact, they had tryouts here.  Card sharks or something.  They had tryouts somewhere in the city not too long ago.  Did they?  For the price of rights.  No, she's like, no, not card sharks.  Price of rights.  I don't watch the price of rights.  They did the price of rights.  They had...  The price of rice. 
[01:28:30]  Price of rice.  Of rice.  What are my favorite choices right now?  Come on in.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Thank you.  You used to work for our show back in the days.  Oh, my God.  What's it serious?  That's all.  This is great.  Hey, how you been?  That's not stinky from...  How you been?  Oh, my God.  It's been a long time.  How you been?  How you been?  We're all swollen.  That's embarrassing.  I put on a little bit of weight.  A little. 
[01:29:00]  A little bit.  Just a little.  Not much.  Just a little.  I don't see pounds, I think.  Don't worry about it.  That's all right.  Your nose is running.  You look good, man.  Thank you.  Stinky.  God, it is.  Stinky.  She looks exactly the same, man.  Exactly the same.  I do?  Yeah.  Not so much Lady Di.  Oh, Lady Di.  Phyllis Spector.  Let me tell you something.  You haven't seen me in how many years.  I don't look the same.  What?  Maybe my hair.  You look good, but you looked good back then.  Thank you.  My hair is short now.  I don't have the perm no more.  I know you were asking Diane about the perm. 
[01:29:30]  No, I keep it real short.  You keep it short.  Short for summer.  Yeah.  And you know, I...  Right, for summer.  Yeah.  In the winter.  Yeah.  What happened to the perm?  When did you lose the perm?  Because it dried my hair out.  Did it?  Yeah.  After so many perms, your hair gets dried out.  Wow, it looked great at the time.  It looks delightful.  It really looks great.  I'm older now.  It's got a nice body to it now.  I'm older.  I always had the same haircut.  Yes.  And I just had a kind of hair.  Just kind of knotted down in the front with a crisp version.  I've forgotten.  You know how Travis said we'd remember things and stuff?  I've forgotten that when you talk to Marion about something, Lady Di will chime in about 
[01:30:00]  whatever it is with her.  She'll make it about herself like, oh, my hair.  Right.  We didn't ask you about your hair, Lady Di.  Oh, my glasses.  We just got a cut the other day.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Colin Quinn.  Colin Quinn hangs with legit celebrities.  We'd rather be here.  Now I don't know what to say anymore.  Hold on.  There was a question in there.  You were going to talk about getting a cut, right?  Is this, like, unbelievable? 
[01:30:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  There was a question.  Marion.  What?  Oh, okay.  So you keep up on the news, you said, Lady Di.  Yeah, I do.  All right.  So what's going on in the news?  Yeah, give us a little recap.  Yeah, because we haven't really done any news yet.  No, no news breaks.  We talked to Patty and stuff.  There was a lot of stuff.  A lot happened in the news.  Right.  Why don't you give us a little synopsis of what's going on in the news this week?  Well, James Gandolfini just passed away.  It's Gandolfini.  Whatever.  Diana, it's Gandolfini. 
[01:31:00]  James Gandolfini.  And then Mary gets back because it's ruining our reputation.  I am going to tell you something.  I was a big soprano fan.  Why would you?  Very big soprano fan.  I even went on a soprano tour three times.  Yeah, she's a big fan.  I am.  I wasn't really speechless.  And I still am a soprano fan.  Wow.  All right.  And I don't get it right.  Gandolfini.  No, it's not.  Oh, oh.  That's very loyal.  Most people are going to turn on me.  I still like three things. 
[01:31:30]  Sometimes.  I agree.  Well, but James Gandolfini dies.  James Gandolfini.  It's Feeney, Diane.  F-I-N-I.  Like Shirley Feeney.  Right.  Get it?  No, that's Shirley Feeney.  Well, you know, but everything else on the news right now is, you know, not really.  What else?  Somebody shooting somebody.  Not that important.  Not that important.  It's been one of the craziest news weeks in a long time.  James Gandolfini dies.  And that's apparently in the second one. 
[01:32:00]  Paul and Dean got canned.  The Zimmerman thing has ramped up.  What about the Aaron Hernandez?  Paul and Dean got canned.  All right.  Paul and Dean.  What about that?  Paul and Dean got fired.  Why?  For like she said to.  She said something.  How is she a racist?  Hold on.  Lady Di, what'd she say?  Yes.  We're on satellite.  What'd she say?  No, no, no.  It doesn't matter.  What'd she say?  I don't want to say it.  Say what?  No, she just said something racist.  What'd she say?  What'd she say?  I don't even know.  What'd she say?  No, no.  Nothing.  She said something that sometimes you got to watch what you say on TV. 
[01:32:30]  What'd she say, Marion?  I'm not really sure, but I know it had something to do with racial.  What'd she say?  What'd she say?  Is there a word or something?  What'd she say?  The N-word.  All right, that's all I'm going to say.  Wow.  Slow down, Lady Di.  What the fuck is that?  It's controversial.  What the fuck is that?  I knew this day would be controversial, but I didn't think it would go here.  You know when you say the N-word, you're actually saying the word.  What the fuck?  Right.  Well, there you go.  I said it.  But there's a lot of...  It was on the news. 
[01:33:00]  There you go.  It's on all over the news, but you know what?  Now she ruined her reputation.  Uh-huh.  And her...  Hey, you know what?  Hey.  You gotta watch what you say.  You do.  You do.  All right, what about the Trayvon Martin, Zimmerman, George Zimmerman murder trial?  I am following that, because I have not been watching the news.  I've been busy.  You're busy.  You've been on cruises.  I know.  Cruise.  Where did she go, though?  That's a great question.  On Caribbean.  I've been watching that.  The guy's still on trial.  St. Martin, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico.  He's still...  He's on trial. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, he's still on trial.  Oh, good.  Okay, good.  I didn't know that.  And what's going on in that trial?  You know what?  I really don't know.  You know, the jury has to decide what they're going to do with him.  What's the basic gist of what happened?  If he's going to go to jail.  What happened?  But what happened in the last couple of days with the trial?  Like, why is he on trial?  What happened with the whole thing?  What's this background story here?  He claimed that he shot him in self-defense.  Okay.  All right?  And his family claims that, you know, that the guy just shot him for who knows what. 
[01:34:00]  So that's all I have to say about that.  I mean, you know.  I don't know who that is, but they wave to me.  Oh, of course they did.  Oh, you're a big star.  People know you guys around here.  Yep.  It was the first time we've been in the studio.  It's nice.  Very nice.  No, it's not.  You think it's nice?  It's not that small.  No?  No, it's a nice studio.  Neither is guys.  It is.  But you know what?  The last time we saw you guys, you guys were down the street on 57th Street.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow, that's a long time ago.  And then the NW, but before that.  What about, hey, Jim? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  I saw you on Channel 12 about a few months ago.  That sounds awful.  That sounds awful.  Jim, have done it.  There's nothing you can really say to that.  It was intended as a cop.  It was intended as a cop.  You look really, really good.  It does look good.  Spotlight.  I think the show was called Spotlight.  Spotlight.  On Channel 12.  News 12, Long Island.  Channel 12.  Jimmy's been all over TV lately.  New 12, New Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  Yeah, I did a interview. 
[01:35:00]  That is a brutal.  Don't even remember, he's from Jersey.  That was like a bat to the head.  He really is.  A bat to the head.  Jim just sat there stunned.  He didn't know what to say.  When's the next time you're going to be at Caroline's?  Probably not until next year.  I just did it.  Really?  Yeah.  Is that the only club you go to?  But guess what?  No, no.  A lot of these are during a week.  I like to know them on the weekends.  He works the comedy cellar all the time down at McDougal Street.  I don't know where that is.  I know it's down in the village.  I'll give you direction.  It's down in the village. 
[01:35:30]  You get off at West 4th Street on any train.  It would be nice to have them down there.  Saturdays?  Friday and Saturdays?  Saturdays and weekends?  No.  Yes.  A lot of Fridays.  Not this weekend, but he's around.  Yeah.  I'll have to come catch your show on a Friday night.  Oh, yeah.  Friday night, he's always there.  Early show.  And then wait for him upstairs.  He goes up afterwards.  Make sure he can go upstairs.  Because I was just here in the city the other day at Street Fair.  Right over here.  Yeah, maybe he's right near there.  I come over here a lot, every couple of Saturdays and Sundays, and my husband come over here  and walk around.  Oh, yeah?  Times Square.  You guys are going all over the place.  Maybe the two of you could come to the show. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  You and Lady Di as well.  Lady Di, you've got to get out.  Thank you.  Because you've got to get out, Lady Di.  It seems like you're sequestering yourself in that house, you're watching television,  you're not getting out.  First of all, we've got to talk about this job situation.  I do go out.  Everyone in this room has talked about the job situation and saying that people got...  Patty was saying she got a job in no time when she needed to get one.  She's doing great.  She's doing wonderful.  She's mad at you.  Patty is doing great.  She's paying all our bills.  She's mad at Lady Di. 
[01:36:30]  Why?  Because you're not taking care of yourself and not working.  I blame...  I do apply for jobs.  I blame his roommate.  His roommate is trouble.  The roommate is...  No, the roommate doesn't.  No, no.  Roommate's an enabler.  No, her roommate retired.  He's an enabler.  And he's doing good.  My husband retired after 41 years of working.  I didn't hear that.  He retired.  Really?  Congratulations.  Yeah, he's doing good.  We're doing both good.  Yeah, good.  We're doing both good.  Yeah, we are.  You guys met him.  Marion, what about Lady Di's roommate?  What's going on there?  Bill's good.  Why is Lady Di hanging with him? 
[01:37:00]  Why am I hanging with him?  Because Bill's a good person.  He really is.  I've been with him for years.  Honestly, no, they've been together for a very long time.  Are they boyfriend and girlfriend?  Yes.  No.  In a way, you two are because you live together.  Oh, boy.  You hang together.  We live together.  That don't mean we're...  But, Diane, he takes care of you.  In other words, he's good to you.  Oh, yeah.  Bill's one of the better guys you've ever been with.  And all she has to do is just kind of milk his cum.  No.  No, no, no, no.  No, it ain't like that.  No, no.  Honestly, I can tell you something. 
[01:37:30]  No, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Talk.  How come she's not letting you talk?  I'm going to talk.  All right.  No, no, no.  Listen to me.  He is a good man.  What do you say?  He is a good guy.  And I got...  Actually, I was the one that was searching for the apartment.  And I got a really nice apartment.  We went through about maybe three places before we got the apartment that we have right  now.  Right?  Yeah.  About three places.  I swear to you, he is one of the best guys ever read.  She's got to talk, though.  Ever read.  How come she won't let you talk?  Because you guys are looking at her.  Go ahead.  He is one of the best guys she's ever been with. 
[01:38:00]  Let's die say it.  Go ahead.  Say it.  What?  He's a very good guy.  We've been together for years and years.  It's on par with the Jeff Probst show.  Wait.  So he's not a good guy?  He is.  He's a very good guy.  He's one of the best guys.  He's in charge of getting an apartment.  Wait.  Is he a good guy or not?  Yeah.  He's all right.  Oh, he's just all right.  He's not all right, Diana.  When you first met him, he was working.  He worked up until he was able to retire.  Right, right.  Holy shit.  That's better than most guys you've been with.  Do you have sex with him? 
[01:38:30]  No.  How often do you give moral sex?  He told us you do.  So nothing like it.  He did say that.  How often?  Occasionally.  Nothing.  Occasionally.  Why?  He told you that.  You blow him.  Yeah.  You don't like sex leading?  He said that.  He said it.  And then you admitted to it when we were on the phone.  Yeah, because I just wanted to change the subject.  You know.  Oh, really?  What's wrong with him that you don't want to have sex with him?  Hey, he got on the phone with you guys.  It's okay.  Because you're not like you're built like Warren Haynes.  I mean, how come you don't do that? 
[01:39:00]  We're sleeping in the same bed.  Yeah, we sleep in the same bed, but that doesn't mean we do anything.  And I want to tell you something.  Bill wants her.  Honestly, because Bill talks to me, because we're close friends, and Bill wants her to straighten out, too.  Yeah.  You're saying get out.  No, Jim.  Sometimes I sleep on the couch.  Yeah?  Why?  Sometimes I sleep.  That's where you're passing out.  That's because I watch TV, and sometimes I just pass out.  No.  No, no.  How many times a week do you pass out on the couch? 
[01:39:30]  I don't pass out.  You do?  You drink?  She takes cat naps.  I go to sleep.  I take cat naps.  That's it.  Cat naps.  Usually after I eat, which is not a good thing to do.  No.  No.  Right.  You know, sometimes I just take a nap.  That's why you put on probably 10 pounds, then.  I tell her, the drinks now, you should drink wine with club soda.  That's what I drink when I drink.  Switches with wine with club soda.  That's horrible.  Why do you like switches?  No, red wine.  You need to put club soda in it.  Open, red wine with club soda.  That's pretty good.  Listen to me.  They call those spritzers. 
[01:40:00]  You want a spritzer.  Red wine spritzers.  I would.  Spritzers.  Spritzers.  Or cherry rum and Coke.  She's spritzing the people in the room just saying it.  Or cherry rum and Coke.  Diet Coke.  Diet, of course.  I would drink white wine with spritzers, but Bill doesn't want anything like that in  the house.  Why?  Good.  He don't want wine in the house.  I think he's got his head on straight.  We got Bob Levy checking in.  Hold on a second.  Bob.  I remember him.  I just wanted to know if they look as bad as they sound. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, boy.  Hi.  How are you, Bob?  I heard about you.  I heard about you.  You're a comedian.  I don't think we look that bad.  Let me tell you something.  I look pretty good compared to what I did years ago.  Ah.  That's right.  You're about a two or a three now.  Hey, somebody bangs you, really?  Two.  Well, Marion's been married for how many years, Marion?  18 years.  And Di was prostituting at one point, but now she's not yet.  And Lady Di was blowing hobos at one point.  I never did that. 
[01:41:00]  You were homeless, and you were having sex with a gentleman for money.  September will be 18 years.  Okay.  Great.  Thanks.  18 years.  How mad is your husband at his dick?  Excuse me?  Don't talk about my husband, honey.  Let me tell you something.  Don't talk about him.  We've been married for 18 years.  We've been together for about 25.  Yeah.  And he's a good guy.  Let me tell you.  He's a better guy than Bob Lavey.  I'll tell you that much.  And let me tell you.  My husband, I'm married.  Diane's the one with the roommate.  Yeah.  Ooh.  But Bill and her are boyfriend and girlfriend, in a way. 
[01:41:30]  She's fine.  It's a modern relationship.  She's good.  They're good.  They're married.  Yeah.  But she's saying that she doesn't have oral sex.  I really don't want to get married again.  It's a modern relationship.  I don't think I got to worry about that.  I don't see a parade of gentlemen on their knee.  After your ex cheated on you with a train, I don't blame you.  Jim, Jim, she wasn't married.  First of all, I was not married to him.  I only had a kid with him.  Don't talk about that.  Same shit.  No, Jim, don't.  Jim, don't.  Same shit.  All right.  Don't go there.  Talk about that.  What? 
[01:42:00]  The choo-choo?  Yeah, don't.  Why?  Because her son's my godson.  Please don't talk about that.  But you know what?  You have something to say to Bob Lavey?  He made fun of the fact that you're married.  My marriage is good.  I have no...  Hey, let me tell you one.  I'm married.  What about you?  Are you married?  Yeah, I've been married three times.  Three times?  Well, let me tell you.  There's something wrong with you or something.  To get married three times?  Face.  You've got to be wrong.  Face.  You do it once, and if it doesn't work out, you don't bother. 
[01:42:30]  And I'm going to tell you something.  18 years and 25 years with the same guy, I got a good marriage.  Believe me.  I got a very good marriage.  Physician, hear thyself.  My marriage was not that good.  And O.B. and Anthony met my husband one time, and he talked to my husband a couple times.  Oh, that's true.  Let me explain something about my marriage right now.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead.  Because now we have to talk about her marriage.  Right.  No.  I just wanted to mention, I was married to the guy seven years, and back then I was working.  Oh.  Okay?  He was the one staying home.  Uh-huh.  So the roles are reversed. 
[01:43:00]  And he was a bum.  What did he do?  Well, he just took care of my son.  Worked for the railroad?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The roles are reversed.  They're on your back, too?  He was taking care of my son when he was a baby, when he was a kid.  Okay?  What?  Yeah.  And he was taking care of my son.  Uh-huh.  And he cooked and he did everything.  I was kind of like spoiled and I was like Mr. Mom.  I used to come home to a nice hot dinner and stuff like that, but he wasn't working.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  I was the one working seven days a week.  So he was like Mr. Mom.  She was.  But you know what?  The guy turned out to be a real jerk. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, boy.  He did.  He turned out to be a real ass.  Oh, what happened?  He didn't like being with an alcoholic?  As part of my divorce, I had to give a part of my 401k to him.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  As part of the divorce.  Chisel on.  Now, ironically enough, that's your weight.  He's not even still around.  He got 40.  I got 60 grand.  Yeah.  Because I was, you know, then I was, uh, I let go.  All right?  So I got 60 grand.  He got 47 grand.  So is Bill just using you for the money?  No.  No.  No.  Because Bill's got his own thing. 
[01:44:00]  He's got a pension.  He's got social security.  He was hired.  You can help him with the bills, though, if that's good.  He's got social security.  And he didn't believe this.  That's normal because you live together.  I do help him out with the bills.  Oh, how?  With dad's money.  With dad's money, yes.  Right now.  Look at that person.  I'm going to tell you something.  I'm going to tell you something.  Diana.  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  Her father and her mom.  God rest her soul.  Because her mom's gone, too.  Mom's been gone for a long time.  Oh, God rest.  God rest.  Thank you.  Do it with my adopted mom and dad, too. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened to your mom?  Did you guys go to high school again?  What happened to my mom?  The big casino?  We lived around a corner.  She's at 15.  I know, right?  I didn't know that.  And I'm 49 and she's 51.  And as far as my dad goes, he had one problem after another.  Same age as Gandalf Feely.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  I'm 49 now.  Some of you, Ant.  Some of you, Ope.  What happened?  He was 83 years old.  We're all 49.  What did you say?  Everyone's 49.  He was 50.  He was 83 years old. 
[01:45:00]  You just said, let me talk, right?  You don't like being interrupted.  To talk.  I am talking.  I'm trying to.  He was 83 years old.  Well, how did you do you trying to?  What's stopping you from talking?  Come on.  We keep on talking on top of each other.  That's what's stopping me.  I'm not interrupting you, Diane.  What's up with the eye, Lady Di?  You're a babbling cunt.  Hey, who's this?  That was uncalled for.  That's still Bob Leiby?  That's uncalled for, Bob Leiby.  Bob Leiby, he's still there.  I'm not a babbling cunt.  You're a babbling dick.  Oh, shit. 
[01:45:30]  There it is.  Fuck.  I'm a babbling cunt.  I don't know about your dick, but hey, you know what?  We don't babble.  We talk.  Yes.  There's a difference between babbling and talking.  Right.  When you're drunk, you babble.  When you're sober, you talk.  That's right.  Right.  Look over there to your right.  That means when I call you, you know I'm drinking.  Yeah.  I know when you're drinking, Diana.  Believe me. 
[01:46:00]  When you call me and I know you're drinking, it's time for me to hang up.  What is she talking about?  What is she saying?  I'm telling you something.  Go ahead, Mary.  I will tell you something.  Go ahead.  When Diane calls me or I call her and I know she's drinking, I'll say, look, Diana, I'll  talk to you later.  Yeah.  Sometimes she says, I'll talk to you later.  How can you tell?  And I don't call her for a call.  I can tell.  Because she talks about the game shows and all that other stuff.  Yeah.  It's very easy.  What does she babble about that you know that she's been drinking, Mary?  I've known her for years.  I know when she's drinking.  I'll give you so.  All right.  All right.  I have to ask you something.  And I will say, I'll call you back in a couple hours. 
[01:46:30]  What is the latest thing I've been babbling about?  The monkeys.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  Back to the news.  How long were you going?  She wanted to tell you where she's going in two weeks.  I'm going to go see the monkeys next month.  Yeah.  I love, didn't want to, didn't Davy Jones just die?  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  Jesus.  About a year ago.  Who goes and sees the monkeys without Davy Jones?  I'm going to see Bon Jovi at the end of July.  I saw Davy Jones years ago.  I got two Bon Jovi shows. 
[01:47:00]  And I saw him with the monkeys also.  What was your favorite song?  Cheer up, sleepy Jean.  That was mine.  Oh, that was a good one.  That was my favorite song.  That was a good one.  And then that was Davy Jones.  What's your favorite monkey song, Lady Diary?  My favorite one?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, with the monkeys.  Besides the theme song.  Last Train to Clarksville.  Oh, is that your husband's favorite?  That was one of your favorites.  Was that the fall of your child's favorite song, too?  Well, it was.  Yes, it was one of my favorites.  It's the last train of anywhere.  No, I was.  Last train of Smoochville.  I'm a believer.  That's a good song.  I'm a believer.  I'm a believer. 
[01:47:30]  That was another one.  I'm a believer.  You know, who wrote that one was, Neil Diamond wrote that one.  Yeah, I know.  Or the one when they first, when the monkeys first come on and they show them in the sand  and all that.  They wrote, oh, yeah.  They did the theme song.  I like that one.  I was one of her favorite songs.  The only person I think that wrote songs for the record albums, I think, was Michael Nesmith.  I think so, too.  You know, his mother.  We went to see him.  His mother invented White House.  We went to a monkey convention.  That's what I'm trying to assure that.  We did.  She drove a monkey convention.  This is horrible. 
[01:48:00]  Anthony, I'm going to tell you something.  His mother invented White House.  Honestly, God, we did.  Yeah, you're right.  I got the middle answer.  What was going on at the monkey convention?  I know all about the monkeys.  It was almost sold out.  So do I.  It was almost sold out.  There was people there from all over the country.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right, wait.  There's too much now.  What goes on at a monkey convention?  There was only two monkeys there.  But in here, too.  I'm going to tell you something.  It wasn't just a monkey's convention. 
[01:48:30]  Huh?  It wasn't just a monkey's convention.  They had Barry Williams was there.  Christopher Knight was there.  Wow.  Susan Olsen was there.  Oh, yeah.  Barry Williams.  There was another guy there from some kind of old-time TV show.  Ah.  It was like one of those kind of conventions.  Butch Patrick was there.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah, Butch Patrick.  Levy, this is a tough one because they just babble, so.  We're not babbling.  People babble when they're drunk.  We'll let Bob Levy go.  Right, right. 
[01:49:00]  Face to Bob Levy.  They put you in your place.  Bob, you lose.  Yeah, Bob, you lose.  They got you today, brother.  They lose today.  They're unbeatable.  Thank you, Bob.  Bye.  I'd love to see you soon, Bob.  Dismissed.  Maybe I'll come to one of your shows.  Bye.  Dismissed.  Ding.  Bye.  Phone call's over.  We had enough time.  Now it's my time.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Oh, Bob.  Goodbye, Bob.  Oh, that's right.  David Cassidy was there.  Oh.  She just reminded me.  I forgot about him.

[01:50:00]  No, we go different routes.  This time we're going different routes.  It's 12 days.  Oh.  I just came on.  I went to one in February for my birthday.  Wow.  What do you do on the cruises?  What do you do on them?  Royal Caribbean.  No, but what do you do on them?  Party.  Go see the shows.  Dance.  Do you gamble at all?  I dance.  Comedy?  I gamble.  You go to the casino?  Oh, yeah.  I play the Penny Machines.  Comedy shows?  Penny Machines.  Yeah, I go to shows.  As a matter of fact, they have two comedians.  One going there and one coming back.  Do you guys have sex on the cruise?  Yeah, that's...  A little bit?  Yeah.  She was ready to say that.  She's like, no, yeah, we do. 
[01:50:30]  How often would you say we're on the cruise?  Every night on the cruise?  Every night.  Are you okay?  Every night.  But you know what?  We get a balcony.  Where are you going?  What's the matter?  We get a balcony.  You all right?  Yeah.  You all right?  You sure, Diane?  Yeah.  Listen, um...  What's wrong?  No.  Wait a minute.  You all right?  Come here.  Come here.

You heard it?  Of course I did.  It's stupid.  Oh, my God.  Turn it up.  I heard it, too.  All right.  Shh.  Marius.  Hang on one second.  Oh, he rock.  All right.  Shh.  She's just...  Okay. 
[01:51:30]  Okay.  Wait.  Just talk in the corner.  I think I got my friend.  Did you hear it?  Yeah.  She got her friend.  Did you hear that?  Circle of life.  Yeah.  Kenny?  Her pussy is vomiting blood right now.  She's lying, by the way.  She went to go drink.  Because she has a fucking thing with beers in it or something.  She, first of all, is 51.  Come on.  The change.  The change has to take.  Her hair looks... 
[01:52:00]  She's young, you know?  She has no great hair.  She's walking through the corporate environment asking every female if they have a pad.  Oh, my God.  She's bleeding.  She's the greatest.  Here's what.  We got to buy her underpants.  I want to see what they look like.  Oh, my God.  She's the greatest.  So, how does she go out not having to have something with her?  She's nervous.  This is a big comeback show for her.  This is big. 
[01:52:30]  This is big.  It's a big event.  You forget the whole...  I just want to keep it off the radio.  Go ahead.  Oh, okay.  Keep it off the radio.  Then why?  I'd like to keep something off the radio.  Okay.  Go ahead.  I've been trying to get Diane help for a long time.  Uh-huh.  Right?  Because I don't want to see her.  And I please...  I want this off the radio.  Honestly, please...  No, it's fine.  Fine.  Promise me you will keep this off the radio because it's got to do with my family.  Oh, my goodness.  Honestly to God, my dad died a year and a half ago.  Jesus.  Oh, God bless.  No, no.  I'm sorry.  No, Anthony, seriously.  I'm sorry I could hear that.  No, I don't want this on the radio.  All right.  If you take the headphones off, it's not on the radio. 
[01:53:00]  Seriously, I'm going to tell you something.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  It turned out to be cirrhosis.  And he had it for years.  Oh, no.  And I worry about that she's going to get like that.  Cirrhosis.  And I see her.  Cirrhosis of liver.  No, I see her and I see...  Sir loin of beef.  No, Anthony, seriously.  I see her and I see two people...  It's from Bugs Bunny.  ...that died in my family from that.  Cirrhosis?  Yes.  And I see...  You're still drinking?  No.  Me?  Oh, Jimmy.  Holy fuck.  Jesus Christ.  You didn't make my coffee. 
[01:53:30]  You fucking bitch.  Jim knocked over the coffee.  It's all right.  Jimmy's that upset about it.  He's got no buttons in front of us.  Here's the newspaper.  And I'm asking you.  And I'm letting you come down.  All right.  All right.  Well, uh...  I worry about her.  So you think she might like get some...  I worry about that because look at...  It's too late to worry about it.  She is.  Colin just dumped his blueberries and Jimmy spilled coffee.  What's the name again?  What?  I don't know.  That's Billy.  That's...  Billy, I hope you're not recording that because I don't want that. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, we can't.  We can't.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Look.  All right.  She looks a little pudgy these days and bloated.  I mean, I don't want to sway because I don't drink as much anymore.  Well, you look great.  You do the spritzers, though.  And I do.  And I do.  Honestly, I got rid of me drinking beer.  And on the cruises, you can tie one on on the cruises, right?  On the cruises, I drink cherry rum and Diet Coke.  How is that?  Good.  And I'll drink vodka.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And you're like, do you do that?  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  I do.  I dance.  Feeling hot, hot, hot. 
[01:54:30]  And I do Zumba.  Conga line?  Do you do the Conga line?  Yeah, and I do Zumba when I'm at the gym.  Zumba.  I just started doing the Zumba.  What is the Zumba?  The Zumba class.  Oh, right, right, right, right, right.  I just started taking them recently.  Yes.  But I do go get a fucking intern.  All right, we're back on the air.  Let's get back on the mic.  We're back on air.  We can talk about the Zumba.  We're back on air.  We're back on air.  All right, put your headphones on.  I don't know where she went, but I don't know.  She's looking for a fucking Kotex.  Jim wants an intern.  He's very angry.  Yeah.  Because I fucking spill a whole thing of coffee. 
[01:55:00]  What happens?  He just walked by.  Could you have an intern come in?  The intern just walked by.  What's he doing?  Maybe you should be angry at yourself for being an ass and spilling coffee on the table.  I don't want to get into electronic stuff.  I'm worried about that.  It's like, send somebody with napkins.  Tyler.  What's your name?  Tyler?  What the fuck are you doing?  You got to get a goddamn napkin for Jim.  Get some fucking paper towels.  He's a fucking intern.  Do we have a Lady Di update?  Piece of shit, this guy.  Is his real name?  Hold on.  Sam has a Lady Di update.  The last we left you, Lady Di was having her friend, and she needed a pad. 
[01:55:30]  She's bleeding from the cunt, and she needed a pad.  So she's soliciting around to every female in the building, which is great.  Yes.  Heather B. from Real World Season 1 was able to give Lady Di a pad.  Nice.  That's a celebrity pad right there.  Yes, it is.  You know, she's 51.  She's probably, she don't get a period no more.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be something else.  Oh, boy.  Why is she walking around looking for a pad?  I know why.  That could be something else.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Jackie's here to save the day. 
[01:56:00]  Jackie's got towels.  Thank you, Jackie.  What happened?  The other intern just got cursed out in here.  Oh.  Because Jackie came to the rescue with napkins.  Right.  Do you got a pad for a, do you have a pad for fucking...  Don't throw that out.  Give it to Lady Di.  Do you understand what's happening?  Yeah.  She doesn't get a period, but she needs a pad because they have those vodka tampons  now.  You think she wants a drink that way?  She's very nervous.  She wants a drink.  She's very nervous.  I don't blame her.  What the fuck?  Is she an alien?  You don't get nervous and bleed from the pussy. 
[01:56:30]  Hey.  It doesn't sound right.  Nobody can withstand the abuse in this community she put up with here.  I don't blame her.  What happens when you surprise her?  She shits her pants?  She's fucking bleeding.  By the way, I'll bet you that she's incontinent.  I'll bet you it's not her period.  I'll bet you she's incontinent.  You think she needs some poise pads?  Yeah.  She might be bleeding from her asshole, maybe.  Wow.  She's taking a turn for the worse.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, yes.  Could you please bestow upon me a Kotex Maxi pad? 
[01:57:00]  I seem to be bleeding from the vagina.  Oh, yes.  If someone has a tampon, I could shove in my vagina.  A little nip off the old vodka bottle and a tampon.  And you know why she's a little nervous, too?  She found out she's got a thyroid disorder.  I have a thyroid disorder.  No, she doesn't.  Oh, yes.  But you know what?  So do I.  But I've had it for 20 years, and I'm on medication.  Oh.  For the last 20 years. 
[01:57:30]  We're away from Mike.  You don't want that on the air.  I don't care.  Oh, you don't care if that's on the air?  Never work with children or animals when you're bleeding from the vagina.  I don't care if that's on the air.  Heather B. asked if it was somebody's mother that had just asked her for a bed.  Somebody's mother.  We should take a break.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll get Lady Di back in here.  Oh, boy.  I have a feeling she's drinking in the bathroom, quite frankly.  You think?  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that is she's incontinent.  She's not getting her period at 51.  No, that's crazy.  And I guess Bobo's going to join this mess next. 
[01:58:00]  Yes, what this needs is Bobo to come in.  And I think we're also doing the pyramid game with these.  Uh-huh.  We do a pyramid style.  Jackie, I think you might have to play.  She does a pyramid game with them.  You might have to be on Bobo's.  Did you meet Bobo, Jackie?  Yes, I did.  I think he's a little smitten with you.  Oh, here comes Lady Di.  Oh, hold on.  All right.  Here she comes.  Old Dealey Plaza pussy is here.  Oh, my God.  Be careful.  Be careful. 
[01:58:30]  Did that pad have a license plate from fucking Arkansas?  That little Kittner boy spill out?  I got one.  Wait.  If you were expecting it, you should carry something.  I wasn't expecting anything.  I used to do that when I got mine, but I don't get mine no more.  Wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  You did not tell him that.  Well, you said it on the radio.  Tell us what?  You said it right on the radio.  No, she didn't.  We heard.  You had your headphones on when you were sitting there.  No, she didn't.  Wait, tell us.  I said I had to go to the bathroom.  No, she said I had my friend.  You're sure you're okay?  Yeah, but I...  We heard you say...  What happened, Di? 
[01:59:00]  Di.  She told us that you had your period.  And Marianne truly believes you take your headphones off, you're off the air.  Di, we all know what happened.  All right, let's be honest here.  You got your period.  Nothing wrong with that.  Now, I'm kind of amazed at 51 that you're still getting your period.  I thought I had it.  What made you think you had it?  What happened?  Because I felt something.  She said you're incontinent.  Are you incontinent?  Do you go to the bathroom on yourself?  No.  Oh, she said you went to the bathroom.  You got a wet spot on your shirt, by the way, Lady Di.  That's from washing my hands.  Maybe you've gotten real nervous.  That's from washing my hands.  Now, Lady Di. 
[01:59:30]  She said you were drinking in there.  Huh?  Were you drinking in there?  She said you were drinking.  Let's smell her breath.  No, I don't.  Now, Lady Di, Heather B. gave you a pad.  Heather B. gave you a pad.  I'm going to smell your asshole.  Heather B. gave you a pad.  You don't carry a can with it.  Yeah.  And you used it?  No, I did not.  Where is it?  Want me to show you?  Please.  Yeah, let's see the pad.  Here I go again.  Right in my pocketbook.  Unbelievable.  You carry everything in there.  Does it look like a PB&J?  What else is in that pocketbook of yours?  I had one like that, too.  I had to get rid of it.  Two bumpy CDs. 
[02:00:00]  I don't carry this.  That's a worthy of Bill Burr.  Blink me, you'll miss me.  That's the pad.  There's the pad.  She didn't use it.  I don't.  Lady Di, what made you think?  Lady Di, Lady Di.  She didn't even get yours no more.  Lady Di, listen to me.  What?  What made you think at 51, after you hadn't gotten your period in a while, that all of a  sudden, out of the fucking blue, you'd get your period.  Tell me what I'm being the other thing.  You were real nervous.  That's all.  It was only a discharge, and that's normal.  Oh, God damn.  Jesus.  I thought, leave me. 
[02:00:30]  I don't have anything.  But wait, what do you mean a discharge?  It did happen.  Just part of being a person.  What happened?  What exactly was it?  What happened?  It was just a discharge.  A discharge.  I thought it was getting you to get.  A discharge of what?  Was it blood?  I don't know.  No, no, no.  Tell me what.  I'm a guy.  I don't know.  Discharge.  What's a discharge?  It's the body.  I have my own body issues.  What is it?  Clear discharge, if you want to know.  All right, anyway.  You're a squirter?  James, it's up.  Are you getting excited?  While you were talking on the air, you had a clear discharge?  Well, yeah.  When I was talking to you guys, all of a sudden, I felt something. 
[02:01:00]  I said, let me go to the bathroom.  Did it soil your underpants or no?  No.  Are you incontinent?  No, no, no.  I'm not incontinent.  So it's a clear discharge in your underpants.  What did you do?  Excitement.  Nothing.  Can we see your underpants?  No.  What color are they?  No.  What color are they now?  What color are they?  They're still white.  White and brown and red.  No, no, no.  I recall panties.  All right, back to the monkeys.  Thank you.  You want to do some karaoke?  Do you know monkey songs?  It's like Bob Ross's palette down there.  Do I want to do karaoke?

How about Pleasant Valley Sunday?  Yeah, let's do some Pleasant Valley Sunday.  I'm not a Pleasant...  No?  How about...  I know the words, but I just...  How about Stepping Stone?  What about David and Oliver?  That was one of my favorites.  That was David and Oliver's friend.  Ah, I'm not just Stepping Stone.  Oh, that was good.  Oh, that was a karaoke.  She says she knows a lot about the monkeys.  We should give her a little...  Yeah, she does.  I know a lot about the monkeys.

I know you've been doing stuff there now.  Oh, my gosh.  California, here and there.  California again this weekend.  I know Letterman.  What, Letterman?  Leno show.  No, Letterman.  Yeah.

Because during the week, I get up at 4 for work.  I have to be in work at 6.30.  Oh, yeah.  Another thing, too, Opie.  You told Diana I never call.  I called a couple times, but you guys had me on hold.  But I have to be in work at 6.30.  I had to go. 
[02:03:00]  That's why.  I see.  Opie.  Are we doing Monkees trivia?  Yes.  Or are we doing Monkees karaoke?  No, Monkees trivia.  But we don't have any.  All right.  Are we back on the radio?  As long as you have the headphones on, we're on the air.  Remember, I taught you that.  Oh, flip that fucking thing.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  It's flipping back again.  That's perfect.  I thought those were on my headphones.  As soon as you take the headphones off, you're off the air.  You know that now, right?  Whoa.  Okay.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You're welcome for that.  Monkees trivia.  What do you want to know about them?

I'm going to be there at the end of July.  This is going to be good.  Two shows.  Any of you guys going to see Bon Jovi?  Yeah.  No, I'm not going this time around.  Why?  Yeah, why not?  I've got Rod Stewart, too, coming up in December.  Yeah?  These guys are no fun anymore.  They don't go to these concerts like that.  Oh, why not?  You guys got to get out there and get out and enjoy.  And do this and do that.  I know, Opie, I know you've got two kids, but you've still got to get out and enjoy.  Look at Colin.  She's right.  A little life lesson right there. 
[02:04:30]  Get out there and you've got to go on a cruise, Opie.  Take the kids on a cruise.  Take the kids on a cruise.  They've got Disney cruises.  Disney cruises.  All right.  That'd be fun.  You're more Royal Caribbean because that's a party boat.  It is.  You know what?  I needed to hear that today, Colin.  I needed to hear that.  I needed to hear that.  Marion, what kind of stateroom do you get when you go on the cruises?  Balcony.  You get the balcony?  Oh, shit.  Balcony.  Balcony.  Nice.  Does your husband bend you over the balcony a little bit?  Yes.  All the time.  All the time.

Do I got to sing with her?  Yes.  Okay.  You can sing backup.  No, no.  Let Lady Di.  Lady Di.  You'll do the bonjour.  You'll do the bonjour.  Home run, Di.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  Anything?  Oh.  Oh.  I thought love was only true in fairy tales.  Then for someone else, but not for me.  Oh.  All love was apt to get me.  True.  It's the way it seems.  To do.  To do.  Disappointment haunted all my dreams.  Everybody else's dreams.  Then I saw her face. 
[02:06:30]  Now I'm a believer.  I'm not a trace of doubt in my mind.  She's on K.  Yeah.  I'm in love.  Ooh.  Oh.  I'm a believer.  I couldn't leave her if I tried.  I should say him, shouldn't I?  Oh.  But love was more or less a given thing.  Seems the more I gave, the less I got. 
[02:07:00]  Ooh.  Life lesson there, huh?  Mm.  What's the use in trying?  Do-do-do-do.  All you get is pain.  Train comes, he's dying.  Do-do-do-do.  When I needed sunshine, I got rain.  My husband got a train.  And then I saw his face.  Do-do-do-do.  It was on the locomotive.  Not a trace.  A doubt in my mind.  I'm in love.  Ooh.  I'm a believer. 
[02:07:30]  I couldn't leave him if I tried.  Big solo here.  What is she saying?  All love was out to get me.  Now that's the way it seemed.  Reef me out.  Disappointment haunted all my dreams.  Then I saw his face. 
[02:08:00]  Now I'm a believer.  Not a trace.  Of doubt in my mind.  I'm in love.  Ooh.  Oh.  I'm a believer.  I couldn't leave him if I tried.  Don't try.  Yes, I saw his face.  Ah, that's the high part.  Now I'm a believer.  Yeah.  Now I'm a trace.  Of doubt in my mind. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Said I'm a believer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  She did it.  She did it.  Thank you very much.  There it is.  And I've got to tell you one more thing, too.  I didn't have to look at the words.  Right.  I knew all the words.  She had to remember.  Yeah, we kind of saw that.  We were pretty impressed.  A monkey song from 1966.  Seven.  Seven.  Seven.  But he's back to those high school days, right?  67.  And it only got a little airplay on the radio.  It's amazing you remembered the words. 
[02:09:00]  I'm amazed she remembers her name.  I think that was pretty impressive.  I think that was pretty impressive.  I've got to say, I think that was pretty impressive.  Good point.  I didn't think she could pull that off.  I went across the street to see the Doobie Brothers.  Yeah.  The whole time Lady Di was singing that, Marion was pointing at Fox on the TV just going,  are the Doobie Brothers across the street?  They are.  They are across the street.  They are across the street.  Yeah.  They let them play for 30 seconds, though.  That's it?  Yeah.  It's not a whole show.  You want to do some Bon Jovi?  I mean, you can't.  You like the Doobie Brothers, too? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, I did.  I grew up with that kind of music.  Yeah, yeah.  You want to sing Doobie Brothers?  Carrie's a kid.  I don't know.  You see the episode with...  I'm not a good singer.  I'm not a good singer, so let's not go there.  You see the episode of What's Happening?  It's great.  Where Lady Di had the fucking recorder in her jacket.  I have a recorder what?  All right.  All right.  Mary, listen.  You got to do your Bon Jovi.  I'll do it, but I'm not.  You got to have the songs up there tonight.  Well, Bon Jovi.  Yeah, you help her.  All right.  Yeah, we'll have the lyrics up there.  You know what?  I don't know a lot of them by heart.  We'll have the lyrics.  What's up there? 
[02:10:00]  I'm not a big Bon Jovi fan, but...  Which one do you like?  Bon Jovi fan since day one, me.  Oh, my gosh.  She's going to do Living on a Prayer.  Living on a Prayer.  Oh, there you go.  That's my ringtone on my cell phone.  I want to tell you guys something.  My husband's home listening.  Oh, he is.  Hi.  Yes, I got the big boombox.  Hi, Joe.  Hi, Joe.  How are you on?  I love you.

If you're listening to the radio, call the show.  Right now, you pan into Joe's house.  You hear the radio, and then you just see two feet swinging.

Move up to the karaoke mic so you can see the screen there.  What's the karaoke mic?  Right there.  Hey, Joe, call up the show if you're listening, please.  All right.  How's your eyesight?

We should get a little more music.  Just a little.  There you go.  Once a time, not too long ago.  Not yet.  Oh, well, maybe.  I think the words light up when you've got to sing them.  Once a time, not too long ago.  Here we go.  No, not yet, not yet.  Not yet.  Ready?  And go.  Tommy used to work on the docks.

You watch a lot of TV, Lady Di.  You like game shows.  You watch the $20,000 Pyramid, right?  I don't want to play the Pyramid Game.  I don't watch that too often.  It's fun.  No one watches it.  Lady Di.  It's fun.  It's for fun.  You've got to play.  You've got to fucking ask them.  Someone, like, describe something.  You've got to, like, let's say I did this, and I went like this.  A cup.

Not tonight.  Maybe tonight, but some night.  I think he's probably there tonight.  No, I'm not.  I'm pretty sure you're there.  Are you having a little anywhere this weekend, Jim?  No, I'm just...  I know you do the Stress Factory a lot.  I've been there a couple times to see your show.  Forget it.  The cell is even closer from Eliza.  You get running there and pay a train and you're there with no time.  The cell is closer to me.  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  Stress Factory is closer to me.  Yeah, Stress Factory is closer to me.

They didn't shut the fuck up the entire time that we were in break.  I was trying to eat a sandwich.  I haven't been to a Mets game in, I don't even know, seven years, probably.  If you're going to start talking Mets, I think we better start...  It's time for Bobo.  We better bring a Bobo in if we're going to start talking Mets. 
[02:21:00]  Are you still a Mets fan?  What?  Are you still a Mets fan?  Oh, headphones are off, so we're off the air?  Are you still a Mets fan?  Okay.  Oh, he's coming.  What is he got?  A bag with him?  Opie, you still a Mets fan?  Bobo's on.  Hi.  Uh, yeah.  You still go to games once in a while?  Yeah, all the time.  I want to apologize because as we look, Bobo's making his way up.  He's running.  He's running.  Making his way up here, and I know how...  Should we set Bobo here?  Yeah.  I got one tomorrow.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, there he is.  There's Bobo.  What is that? 
[02:21:30]  You bought these from my sister?  Oh, I bought the...  Hey, Bobo.  How you doing, Bobo?  Oh, they're my Girl Scout cookies.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  I bought Girl Scout cookies from Bobo's sister, and that was back in, I think, 2009.  It's nice to finally get them.  Are you going to eat them?  It's...  No, throw them in the pool.  I'll find the leak.  No, of course.  Colin, watch out.  You got the paparazzi behind you.  Thank you, Bobo.  I know.  Now Lady Di is taking a picture of Bobo. 
[02:22:00]  It's like...  No, she's taking a video of Bobo.  ...of the retarded Woodstock going on in here.  Oh, yeah.  It's a video.  Bobo, what are you doing?  Bobo.  The other way.  No, the other way.  No, Bobo.  No, you're upset.  No, you got to...  You got to upside down.  Bobo, no, you got to...  Oh, my God.  Come on.  You got to get...  I don't know how to use it.  Yeah.  All I see is they're handing a phone back and forth trying to video something.  Yeah.  I don't know if Lady Di wants Bobo to video them.  Okay, wait.  Headphones. 
[02:22:30]  Come on.  One, two, three headphones.  We stopped it.  Ready?  Check, go.  He's not on mic.  Bobo.  Sit down.  Bobo, Bobo.  Come on.  Bobo, Bobo.  Pull the mic up to have an adorable mug of yours.  Come on, get with the program.  Come on, man.  You've been here enough.  You've been here with me and Diane, Ben.  Bobo, welcome back to the program.  It's great to see you, Ann.  Thank you.  Great to see you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Bobo.  It's good to see you.  It's been quite a while since you've been on the show, and you've been very patient.  You haven't even uttered a sound about wanting to be back on the show in quite some time. 
[02:23:00]  Which was very nice of you.  What do you think of these two behind you?  Have you guys ever met before?  First time.  First time.  What do you think of them, Bobo?  They look pretty much how I imagined.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You, no.  I look better.  Yeah.  I look better than I did eight years ago.  Yeah, but he said you look like he imagined.  Well, how did you imagine them, Bobo?  Yeah.  What, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  How'd you imagine them?  Yeah, we want to know.  I kind of imagine them being a little bit shorter.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  And a little bit more fatter.  Oh, really?  Hey, Marion, did you hear that?  He thought you'd be a little more fatter.  Meaning you are fat.  I was eight years ago fat, but not no more.  Not no more.  No, you're delightful.  Bobo, she's not fat, right?  Not anymore.  No, no.  You look like you're losing some weight.  Yeah, thank you.  I lost over 40 pounds.  And Lady Di is here?  What about Lady Di?  Yeah.  I gained weight.  I know I did.  I gained weight.  I already know that. 
[02:24:00]  So what do you think of Lady Di there, Bobo?  Yeah.  She's also kind of taller than I imagined.  Uh-huh.  Right.  And what about weight?  Well, she looked like she might...  According to her, she might have gained a little weight.  Yeah, yeah.  I know I did.  He's very politic.  Yeah.  Would you...  Given the opportunity, would you and Lady Di there maybe hook up?  Yeah.  Have a little sex?  She lives with a guy, by the way.  Yeah.  That's the one that came in her pants.  She came in her pants.  I did not come in my pants. 
[02:24:30]  My God.  There's nothing wrong with this.  Kenny's been telling everyone that Lady Di came in her pants.  She came in her pants while she was dancing.  She was thinking of the monkeys.  It was a little exciting.  She got excited because she's seen Anthony for the first time.  I remember Anthony.  She had a crush on you at one time.  Well, she could sure crush me now.  See, as I said there.  Now, Bobo, would you...  Oh, what?  Nothing.  I don't know nothing.  She said something to me.  What did you say?  Just take the headphones off so you can hear it.  Little secrets back and forth.  Hold on.  Take the headphones off so you can't hear it. 
[02:25:00]  I kind of understood her.  Go ahead.  Say it to her so we won't play.  I still have a little crush on you.  Oh!  You're so cute.  I ain't got a crush on Opie, but not no more.  He's got two kids.  Not no more.  Yes.  I still dig into you.  You're good looking.  I can't even beg a two anymore.  Oh, wow.  You're a family man.  See, that was it.  You guys didn't realize that you could get lucky at that VMA party.  You know what?  You know what?  We cannot leave out to Norton Colloquine. 
[02:25:30]  Opie, your wife's a lucky woman.  Thanks.  How about this?  Opie and Anthony obviously have the prizes.  I'll settle for Jackie.  And you can take Lady Di.  I hope you got married.  Settle for Jackie.  And I'll take the third prize.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the third prize?  Me and Opie and my foot glass of wine together.  But you don't drink wine.  Or do you?  Oh, I like a good spritzer myself.  Ah, see?  See, you know.  Bobo, what do you think?  Would you bed down with Lady Di if you're given the chance?  That's a great question. 
[02:26:00]  Maybe after two bottles of Jack.  What does that mean, Bobo?  For the people that don't understand, what does that mean?  I mean, she's a little bit, she seems a little bit too old for me.  How old are you, Bobo?  How old are you?  I'm 30.  30?  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  She is too old for you.  Yeah, that's terrible.  She's a wild woman.  Yeah, yeah.  She might give you something, you know.  Yeah, she gets really wet.  Unfortunately, she's married, but... 
[02:26:30]  No, she's not married.  She's not, Lady Di.  No, I'm the one that's married.  No, I'm married.  I'm the one that's married.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Don't mess me up with Diana, because I'll have your head on a silver platter, buddy.  Oh, good one.  Don't mess me up.  No, really.  I'm not married.  She's on fire today.  Look at Bobo, just turns around all confused.  No, because I don't want him to confuse me.  I'm the one that's married.  Right, right, right, right.  You're the one that has your life together, and you don't want to be confused with the 
[02:27:00]  mess.  You're right.  Thank you.  Yes.  Like, you're looking...  We're talking about Lady Di.  Now, you swig down some Jack.  Two bottles of Jack.  What do you think?  What do you think?  Well, she probably looked like a six after two bottles of Jack.  What do you think she is now?  What is she now?  She might be a four.  Oh, so you drink and she'd get better.  Lady Di, take that.  Like a six.  Trust me.  Take the four.  Take the four.  Lady Di.  I would just take a five.  Not question the four.  Make it even. 
[02:27:30]  Well.  Well, he's...  A four.  I hope he goes, take the four.  Take the four.  That was a gift.  Now, you can give her a four.  Yeah, a four.  Oh, you're being nice because she's in the room?  No, because he didn't hear the karaoke.  Yeah, that's true.  You missed us with the karaoke.  You could have put him on with us.  You could have sang Bon Jovi.  I don't know if he's in the...  They have a speaker in the other room.  Are you going to listen to it?  He could have came in and sang with us.  That's the most inane battle.  You could have done it like a three-on-the-cold.  Not that duet, but...  Right.  It's... 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Duet.  And Lady Di, what about you?  What about you with Bobo?  What do you think of Bobo?  What do you think of Bobo?  I think he's a nice person.  He's a nice person.  He's too young for me.  She's spoken for.  She sleeps in a bed with her.  You could be a cougar.  Oh, yes.  Lady Di could be a cougar.  We could get Bobo fixed up for Patty.  But she has a crush on Anthony.  That's the problem.  I also have a crush on Peter Tork of the Monkees.  Oh, yes.  We have a lot in common.  Me and Peter Tork.  I met Peter Tork. 
[02:28:30]  You did?  I met him, too.  On remote control?  I met him several times.  I met him.  I met him several times.  I met Lady Di.  Yeah.  We met David Jones too many years ago before he died.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't even know where to go anymore.  Yeah.  The only one we did not get to meet is Michael Nesmith, and I'm hoping that that'll happen.  But he's rich.  I told you, his mother invented whiteout, as you know.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not going with her to see the monkeys. 
[02:29:00]  I like the fact that all your monkeys facts are falling flat in front of Lady Di, the monkeys expert.  I knew about the whiteout.  Exactly.  He's trying to impress you with monkeys' knowledge, and so you're not calling for it.  Hey, Diane.  Hey, Colin Quinn.  Take Colin Quinn with you to the Count Basie Theater.  Would you like to go?  I don't know.  You said you wanted to go, Colin.  I would love to go to the Count Basie Theater.  But Colin...  If Jim would book a gig there, I'd work there in two seconds.  Go with her to see the monkeys, Colin.  She's looking for somebody to go.  You said you wanted to go.  What is that?  I can't go with her.  It's a Wednesday night.  It's a Wednesday night.  You're off that night.  No, I'm not. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, you don't do shows on Wednesday.  Yeah, you don't do shows on Wednesday.  I said it was dark.  But I have a benefit that night.  What about you, Jim?  Are you available?  Would you like to go with Diane?  I'm doing a benefit.  I got two tickets, and I have a maybe.  I have a person that maybe will go.  Oh, okay.  Who's this?  Ant, would you like to go with her?  A friend of mine.  No, it's a friend of mine.  Well, I'm probably very busy that evening.  All right.  Anybody here that's single like to go with Diane?  My roommate does not...  My roommate is not interested.  No. 
[02:30:00]  He won't go.  Bobo.  Right, right.  Bobo.  Hold on.  I got to talk to Bobo for a second.  And I can't go.  Colin's trying to set you up.  With Seinfeld.  That's true.  Yeah.  It's looking pretty good, by the way.  Yeah, I'm trying to work on that, because I've been trying to get tickets to the All-Star  game.  We should just tweet at him a lot.  That will help.  Yeah, he's a Mets fan.  I can notice that.  Which everybody knows is at Citi Field this year.  Yeah.  Oh, everybody.  When is it?  And I think that would be a huge honor to actually be able to be at the game with Seinfeld,  the bigot, who I consider the most famous Mets fan ever. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Jim Brewer's a Mets fan.  Well, Seinfeld.  So is Opie.  Right?  Seinfeld, though.  Now, would you like Colin to hook that up?  Yeah, I would love that.  That would be a huge honor.  Here's the problem, though, Bobo.  Colin is Mr. Forgetful.  And he forgets a lot of things.  The thing is, you got to tweet.  Oh, no.  Look what happened. 
[02:31:00]  You wanted to be on the show.  And you made it happen.  You made it happen.  Persistent, and you tweeted us, and you're back on the show.  Yeah.  You know, you want girls to get in touch with you?  You tweet them, tweet them, tweet them, and then they get in touch with you.  Colin is Mr. Forgetful.  You got to tweet them about the Jerry tickets.  And you got to let Jerry know, too, because then Jerry will say, Colin, when are we going  tickets for this guy?  So Colin and Jerry on Twitter, just keep reminding them about the All-Star Game.  And before you know it, you know, we're here at the All-Star Game, and here's Jerry Seinfeld 
[02:31:30]  in the stands, and you'll be right next to him.  That's a great idea.  Jerry will pick you up in his Porsche, because he likes to pick people up.  He likes to drive his Porsches.  You ever see his show?  Comedians getting coffee in a car or something?  Yeah, I've seen it.  Wouldn't that be good if you were on that?  Yeah, that would be a huge honor to be actually on there drinking coffee in a car next to  Seinfeld.  Wow.  Hold on.  That'd be huge.  We got a surprise guest coming in.  Oh, my God!  We got a surprise guest coming in.  Oh, what is that?  Did he just give you a note?  Give me his email and his number. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, good.  There it is.  All right.  We need another mic.  Here's Marion's mic.  Hello.  What's going on this morning?  Hi.  Wait, Sharon, Mike.  Marion, Sharon.  You two, Sharon, Mike.  Who is this guy?  Yeah, you two.  She's looking at Lady Di.  I'm Ira.  Ira, sit over here.  What is this?  Ira, sit over here.  I've never heard of him.  You can sit here.  I'll sit over to the corner.  No, Kyle, you're fine.  No, no, no.  Ira, come over.  No, no, no.  It's good.  It's good. 
[02:32:30]  We got a mic.  Sit, sit, sit.  Kyle, we got a mic.  All right, hold on.  Ira's putting his headphones on.  Yeah, get them headphones on.  Ira, how you been, my friend?  All right.  Pretty good.  Oh, my God, who is this?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  This guy, this guy will give you the weather.  Ask him the weather.  Ask him the weather.  I have no idea who this is.  Never heard of him.  Nope.  You never heard of me?  No, I'm sorry.  I'm the famous Ira.  Famous Ira?  Ira who?  Ira here?  Ira there? 
[02:33:00]  I don't know.  I'll know you.  This guy is Ira.  She's on fire.  She's on fire today, Matt.  You don't know about us.  You should have heard about us many years ago.  Marion's scared.  Eight or nine years ago.  She's a little scared by Ira.  What do you sing?  We sing Bon Jovi.  We sing a lot.  We do stand-up.  We do this.  We do that.  I mean, you don't know us?  Bubba, what does he put?  I know the quick goals.  I wanted to tell you something.  Why didn't you get the double A here, the camp driver?  Oh, big A?  Big A?  I seen him last summer. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, how about that?  At South Street Seaport.  Ira, you're single, right?  Well, Diane is single.  Diane is single.  Ah, well, maybe.  You're going to go out for a drink.  Ira, do you drink?  She's going to see the monkeys.  Where do you drink?  I drink soda.  Well, you can go to monkeys with her.  Monkeys, where is that?  Oh, God.  Hellfacey Theater.  The monkeys.  Hey, hey, where the monkey, you know.  We've got the monkeys in a South Park Zoo.  We've got the monkeys in a Ronk Zoo.  We've got the monkeys in a...  Ira, what do you think?  You and Lady Di over there go see the monkeys, the band. 
[02:34:00]  The monkeys, the band?  When?  When?  When?  I already have someone to go.  No, you're not a liar.  When is it?  July 17th.  That's a Wednesday.  A Wednesday, July 17th.  Are you available on a Wednesday to go, my friend Diane?  Why can't you go, Ira?  No.  Why?  I have something special.  Do you work?  Oh.  Are you retired?  I'm retired.  Oh, so do you know how to do it?  We don't have to get up the next morning.  It's very aggressive.  He is very aggressive.  We do have nothing to do with her one thing. 
[02:34:30]  I go to Yonkers.  Yeah.  I go to the casino.  So do I?  I've been at Resorts World Casino.  I bet you you go there.  Oh, no.  I don't go in there to that place if they gave me a thousand dollars.  Then where do you go in Yonkers?  I go to Empire City.  Okay.  I go.  I've been there, too.  And it's nice.  I'm so mad.  Yeah, you could bat horses up there, too.  And it's nice, and it's beautiful.  This is mad at me.  It's salivating.  It's a room full of tradables. 
[02:35:00]  Have you ever been to Atlantic City?  I've been to Atlantic City.  How many times?  We're closer to that.  A lot of times.  No.  We'll share with...  No.  You're not sharing a mic.  You're holding one in your hand.  Yeah, I know.  What are you telling me to move closer there?  So the casinos.  Now, what's your favorite game, Ira?  Penny slots.  You play the penny slots.  Do you ever win on penny slots?  Yes, I do.  How much?  I can't say that.  How much do you spend on a penny slot?  I need people to follow me all around. 
[02:35:30]  People don't tell how much they make.  But what I'm saying, when you go to a casino, you go once a week, once a month.  Twice a week.  Twice a week.  Wow.  Good for you.  Good for you.  I haven't been in a casino in years.  I go every five months.  You go every day.  Every day?  I don't have the money every day.  You gave me the money.  I'd go every day.  You have to work.  You got the money.  I don't have the money.  You got the money.  No.  I don't have the money to gamble with.  I play pickets every day. 
[02:36:00]  That's gambling.  Well, that's different.  I play pickets every day.  What's pickets?  Tickets.  Pickets.  Pickets.  Pickets tickets.  Over here, you call it a...  Pick three, pick four, cash five, pick six.  Pick picks.  Pick picks.  Pick picks over here.  Yeah, something like play lotto.  Would you be interested in maybe you and Diana going out?  Because she is single.  No, no, no, no.  Why not, Ira?  Why not?  Why?  She's not your cup of tea?  No, not my cup of tea.  What's wrong with her, Ira?  What's wrong with her?  What's wrong with Diana?  Nothing.  She's a nice person. 
[02:36:30]  I think I might be a little too young for her.  What is it, though, Ira, that's not your cup of tea about her?  No, no.  What do you like in a girl?  What do you like in a girl, Ira?  What's your type?  Nice.  Happy.  That's it.  What about physically?  We are happy.  Are you married?  It comes in her pants real easy.  Oh, she did.  She came in her pants just before, Ira.  Kenny.  She squirted in her pants.  Oh, I don't know.  She was so excited.  She got nervous.  She hasn't seen you guys in years, so she was kind of nervous. 
[02:37:00]  She got a crush on Anthony.  She came in her pants.  She came in her pants.  Thanks for the reminder.  I also have a crush on Peter Tork, also.  Yeah, I know.  You said that.  You said that.  So what is it about whoever you wouldn't like?  Because she's asking for some self-improvement.  Some honesty, Ira.  Anyway, I think Peter is married, so.  Just be honest, Ira, and let her know what she could do about herself to gussy herself up for men.  Oh, I know.  Ira, comment.  I want a skinny purse.  That's right.  We'll let you know what we'll get you fixed up with Dr. Uncle Patty. 
[02:37:30]  We'll get you fixed up with Dr. Uncle Patty.  She skinny?  Yes, Patty.  She still skinny?  Where is she?  I don't know.  Where is she?  Wait, Ira, are they a little overweight?  A little overweight.  Both of them?  Both of them?  No, only one.  Yeah, that would be me.  Which one?  That'd be me.  I'm not going to say which one.  You know why?  If you say anything about me, I had to be on a silver platter.  Oh, the silver platter again. 
[02:38:00]  Ira.  You're going to take that, Ira.  But he's looking at me, too.  Yeah.  A silver platter.  Yes, I am a little on the head of a silver platter.  We're doing the weather from the roof.  We're doing the weather from the roof.  It's going to be very, very warm and humid.  Are you a baseball fan?  Who do you like?  Mets or Yankees?  I like the Mets.  Oh, no, so do I.  Oh, man.  What am I going to raise the Mets?  Bobo, would you go to a game with Bobo?  Bobo!  Would you date Bobo? 
[02:38:30]  You mean to tell me you're gay?  Bobo.  Bobo?  Bobo, are you going to take that?  Hold on, hold on.  Bobo.  Remember, this weekend is a gay pride parade.  Oh, that means you're gay.  What's going on?  No, I am not.  So why did you bring that up then?  Yes.  Whoa, good one.  Why did you bring the gay pride parade up?  I think I would bring that up because he's going to watch it.  It would be nice for everybody.  Oh, Bobo jumping in.  Would you go to a game with Bobo?  Would you go to the gay parade?  Would you go to the gay pride parade that goes right down the village? 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  From 23rd?  Yes.  Do you go every year?  Bobo's probably watching it.  He's probably salivating watching that parade.  It's not Bobo.  30 nights.  Oh, God.  It's getting the sound of the village.  Bobo's had it.  Bobo.  Bobo, what do you think?  Bobo, what do you think about Ira in the gay parade?  He's probably secretly salivating watching that.  Or he's probably getting confused with the trannies.  Whoa.  He's probably getting confused.  He says, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  No, wait.  It was a tranny. 
[02:39:30]  They did a good job with no surgery.  And I bet you he gets really confused with the Japanese ones.  Whoa.  We all know the Japanese are good at that surgery.  If Jerry heard this, he'd invite you to the game immediately.  A second.  That's funny stuff.  He likes witty, witty banter.  Yes.  That's funny stuff.  Jerry loves it.  Ira, he's giving you the business there, Bobo.  Bobo.  This is no good, Bobo. 
[02:40:00]  You sound like you're drunk.  You okay?  Do you drink?  Did somebody put something in your coffee?  Yeah.  Bobo.  Wow.  It delivers.  It's a rat pack.  I'd like you to be meeting everybody.  Have a good weekend.  Today is going to be 86 to 90 degrees.  Wear a hat in the sun.  Thank you for your fault.  And go swimming. 
[02:40:30]  Wait, you got a pool?  What about check the elderly?  I'm going to Anthony's house for his pool.  Oh, yeah?  I'll send you to Atlantic City.  You got to get his address.  I'll be there tomorrow, Ant.  Oh, yeah?  Ira?  Yeah, after the Met game.  All right.  Ira, would you go to a game with Bobo?  No, I would not.  Why not?  He wants to go to a game with him.  I wouldn't.  You don't like Bobo?  Bobo is a nice guy.  Bobo, have a good weekend.  Enjoy it.  I have to get back to my other position. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, have fun.  I guess you'll be going to the game parade on Sunday, right?  I am going to be on Fifth Avenue.  We're waving a rainbow flag?  That is right.  What is it, Ira?  Are you guys trying to suck my dick at that parade or something?  Oh, wow.  Oh, please.  Home run, Daniel.  There goes Ira.  Wow.  Why would you have your dick out at the gay parade for him to suck anyway, Bobo?  Actually, I'm not even going to be there. 
[02:41:30]  That parade freaking creeps me out.  What's wrong with the gays?  I have nothing wrong with the gays, but it's just sometimes when you see, like, I don't  know, sometimes you get a weird feeling.  In your pants?  No, no, no.  Do you get a weird feeling?  Do you get a staring in your underwear?  No, but you get a creepy feeling, like, you know what I mean, like that homophobe feeling.  Hey, Bobo.  Did you see that, Domo?  They're just like you and me.  Just like all of us.  Retarded.  Really.  There's not wrong with gays. 
[02:42:00]  Not wrong with gays.  Not wrong with them, but what about the Defense of Marriage Act?  But you know what it is?  They should make it legal in Jersey.  Oh, yeah?  And a lot of other places.  Well, Christy doesn't think so.  Christy's a bum, but let's not get there.  Let's not go here, please.  Well, you kind of went there.  He was kind of busy eating cookies with E-Rock.  Oh, wow.  E-Rock, comment.  You don't like him?  Bobo just smashed you, E-Rock.  Actually, you know, I got a name for Governor Chris Christy.  I call him Christy Cream. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  I call him Governor Christy Cream.  You're a home run, Bobo.  Chip, I like that one.  You know that, right?  What?  What was that?  I just...  I'm going to tell you something.  Actually, I'm going to tell you something.  I just don't like him as Governor.  That scared me.  I'm sorry.  What?  What scared you?  I just don't like Christy as Governor.  That's all.  He did have...  Okay.  Yeah.  He did have the lap band surgery, so this way he didn't lose weight. 
[02:43:00]  Wait, what do you mean?  What's that about?  But, Diana, what did he do for Jersey?  Do you know anything about politics?  Louder.  You don't know nothing about politics.  I do.  He helped with Hurricane Sandy.  I know that.  Yeah, well, I donated to Hurricane Sandy.  I did, too.  But, see, so did everybody.  Hurricane Sandy didn't affect just Jersey.  It affected New York.  Yeah, New York, too.  Right.  No, it's true.  Yeah, but she's saying you don't know anything about politics, though, right?  Yeah.  She is, right?  She doesn't.  Ooh, but you...  But what I'm trying to say, he hasn't done much for Jersey. 
[02:43:30]  Ooh, you do vote, right?  Yeah.  Tell her.  Don't tell me.  Yeah, but...  She knows that.  It's because I vote, too.  I vote, too, but...  Yeah, but she's saying she does.  Right, right.  Yeah, but do you know, like, what...  He doesn't...  He shouldn't sign the gay rights bill.  Right.  What's wrong?  All these other states have it.  Why not him?  Yeah.  What's wrong with Jersey?  Die?  Comment?  Yeah, comment, you know.  There could be somebody gay in his...  She's saying you don't vote, though.  There's a...  There are gay people in Jersey.  She's saying you don't vote.  There are gay people in Jersey.  I'm telling you, he's raising taxes. 
[02:44:00]  Wow, there are gay people in Jersey.  I didn't think that was true.  And he's raising taxes in Jersey, too.  Yeah, yeah.  So you've got to think about that.  Do you want your rent to keep going up every year?  I don't want my rent to keep going up every year.  Shut up, cunts.  It's bobo ties.  We get it, all right.  All right.  You're weaker than the storm.  Hey, bobo.  Don't sit there.  Chime in with us. 
[02:44:30]  You know, you're standing looking at the mic.  Talk.  You want to talk?  You forgot to mention that the property taxes, it's pretty much more of the same.  Well, we don't live in Jersey, so you don't know.  Well, I hear about it all the time.  Property taxes, property taxes.  But New York is high, too.  All these political ads I see in Jersey, that's all the politicians in Jersey see the campaigning on.  Property taxes, property taxes.  And all I keep hearing from people I know in Jersey, more of the same.  It's everywhere. 
[02:45:00]  It's everywhere, too.  You know, even here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I hear from where Ant lives that you keep paying property taxes, property taxes.  Every politician keeps bragging about property taxes.  I'm cocky.  I'm cocky, and I approve this method.  Keeping property taxes down, more of the same.  More of the same.  Yeah.  More of the same.  That could be like your catchphrase.  More of the same when you run for office.  We're running out of time.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're running out of time, and we want to do the pyramid game, right? 
[02:45:30]  Let's do the pyramid game.  Let's do it.  Hey, my phrase is, let's do it.  Well, you got to say it with some gusto.  Let's do it.  That was it.  That was her catchphrase.  That was her catchphrase.  I remember that.  I don't have a phrase.  I knew she was going to say.  Well, why don't we come up with a phrase for you today, Lady Di.  Oh, boy.  Let's go.  Let's do it.  I got a ball, Diane.  Come on.  Moo is taken.  What's going to be a phrase?  Come up with one right now.  How are you?  That's all I know.  How are you said? 
[02:46:00]  She didn't have how are you.  Kenny's coming in.  Well, that's the only one I can think of.  Cup soda Kenny's coming in.  Oh, Kenny.  Kenny, you got any cup soda, mix of wine?  Yes, Kenny.  Your phrase is, I cum in my pants.  Kenny will not let that go.  He's going to be talking about this for a long time.  Oh, boy.  Look out.  Don't mention it on your radio show.  I'm going to listen to the replay tonight.  So who's going to team with Bobo?  I kind of wanted Ira to team with Bobo.  Did Ira really work with you guys?  Ira ain't coming back.  Someone on Twitter pointed out that the lady died looks like Jonathan Winters. 
[02:46:30]  He died.  Got to bring everyone down in the room.  Jesus.  He did.  Gee.  Oh, yeah.  Jonathan Winters died too.  A long time ago.  Well, yeah.  Quite a while ago.  A long time ago.  A long time ago.  Let's set up for the Pyramid Game.  Let's set up for the Pyramid Game.  Should we take a quick break?  Yes.  What about Wheel of Fortune?  All right.  E-Rock needs to take a break just for fucking show shit.  Yeah.  So we're going to take a quick break.  We're going to play the Pyramid Game with these guys. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  Hopefully we'll get Ira back.  Maybe not.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Get somebody else.  You'll be in every show.  On Serious Ex.  Now, now, back to our show.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  Now, back to our show.  Continues.  Now, back to our show.  Now, back to our show.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  Continues.  Shut up, cunts.  It's bobo time. 
[02:47:30]  Want to thank Colin Quinn for rearranging his schedule for this.  For this.  For this.  It's almost suicidal.  What they've done.  What did you say?  My granddaughter?  What happened?  Oh, cute.  Very cute.  Aw.  What happened?  Oh.  Oh, no.  I think, I think, um.  Good luck with her.  Whoa.  Congratulations.  I'm shaking my hand.  I don't know.  What happened?  Very cute.  I'll tell you what happened.  Congratulations.  Mary is trashing them the whole place. 
[02:48:00]  She's on fire today.  She's trashing the whole place.  She's burning this place down.  She is on fire.  Colin, what's your observation so far?  My observation so far is, well, I think Anthony put it best on a break.  Yeah.  When he said, one picks up on something, the other one says it like it's gold.  And they just start rambling inanely for hours saying nothing.  It's about, quite literally, nothing.  It's just.  We were in the bathroom.  I said to Colin, what a great show. 
[02:48:30]  And he goes, yes, it really is.  The girls look radiant.  I guess we're ready for the pyramid game, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  How's this going to work?  Well, we have two teams.  All right.  We have two teams.  Oh, they don't.  Which team would you like to start with?  Well, we got to start with the stars.  All right.  Lady Diane Marion are the stars.  Lady Diane and Marion, you know the rules of the game.  There it is.  I was waiting for that.  Famous music.  Very memorable. 
[02:49:00]  Ladies, do you know the rules of the game?  One of you will be giving the clues.  The other will be receiving the clues.  You will be given a topic or a subject or an item that you must describe to the other one  without using the...  They're not even listening.  They're not even listening.  It is anti-radio.  Marion, what's the problem over there?  What's going on?  She's fine.  She's having a hard time getting up.  You're talking to the mic.  Why are you having a hard time getting up, Lady Diane?  I hurt my knee a little bit. 
[02:49:30]  She's glued to the fucking couch with that jizz.  Yeah.  With her fucking menopause jizz.  Well, how'd you hurt your knee?  Oh, boy.  Dancing.  Dancing with a roast beef?  What were you...  Marion yells, she doesn't dance.  Dancing, doing the mambo with a meatloaf.  She's dancing with a foot in her hand.  No.  All right.  Look.  Put your head...  Holy fuck.  This is so frustrating. 
[02:50:00]  I'm moving the microphone so people can hear me.  Oh, Travis.  What are we supposed to do here, Travis?  I'm going to tell you guys.  You've got to put your headphones...  Lady Di.  Yes.  Put your goddamn headphone on.  Wait a minute.  Twist that around.  It's like she's looking at a computer.  What?  What's wrong?  She's trying to put headphones on and is boggled.  She's bamboozled by the headphones.  You put them on your head.  Oh, my God.  That's it.  There.  There you go.  You're shaking pretty good, Lady Di.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Isn't that shaking?  Well, it is 930.  Okay.  It's like fucking 10 shots deep by now, I'm sure. 
[02:50:30]  Lady Di.  Yes.  Marion.  You ever hear of the game, the $25,000 pyramid with Dick Clark?  Yeah.  Is it good?  Now, here's how it worked and how it will work here today.  One of you will be given...  One of you will be given...  You can't hear anything?  I can't hear.  All right.  Now I can hear.  I can't.  I can't take this.  I can't hear now.  Now you can hear, right?  You can hear now, all right?  Holy shit. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Ant's trying to describe the game to you ladies.  Here's...  Okay, we're going to try again.  Here's how the game works.  Go ahead, ma'am.  Okay.  Can we get the music?  All right.  One of you will be given a topic or a subject or a thing that you need to describe to the  other one.  The other one then must say what that topic or subject or thing is, but you can't use the  name of it when you're giving the...  What's the problem?  You can give the clues, Marion. 
[02:51:30]  No.  Are you going to answer?  No, we tell...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  No, they tell the clues.  All right.  You can choose.  That's fine.  That's fine.  So she's going to be giving the clues to you.  And you're going to have to come up with an answer.  You're going to have to come up with an answer.  Right.  All right.  We have a list of clues.  Yes.  Turn around.  That we're going to be...  Yeah, you turn that way.  Don't look.  That's me.  All right.  Sam will...  Give me the sheet for the clues.  All right.  That's good.  No, no.  Sam will show it to you over Lady Di's shoulder.  Okay.  And then...  And then...  She's got to take her headphones off so we can say what the clue is to the audience.  Right, right, right. 
[02:52:00]  Wait a minute.  Do I got to take my headphones off?  No, not you.  Lady Di...  Maybe they should leave the studio.  No, just for a second.  No, no.  Just for a second.  No, no.  Diane, take your headphones off.  Take your headphones off.  Give me...  Oh, do you want to whisper to the audience or...  Hold on.  Yeah.  Okay.  We don't want you to see the clue.  Hey, earmuffs.  Lady Di, earmuffs.  Earmuffs.  Put your fingers in your ears.  Earmuffs.  Not the headphones.  The radio comes through there.  We want to make sure you don't hear.  We want to make sure you don't hear.  All right.  All right.  Stay like that.  All right.  Things people like to eat.  She has hairy armpits, by the way.  There we go. 
[02:52:30]  Wow, does she?  All right.  There it is.  Marion, she's got hairy armpits.  I don't live with her.  Tell her to shave.  I shave.  You don't see my legs.  My legs ain't hairy.  My arms ain't hairy.  No.  All right.  Now.  It's what we do.  All right.  You turn around.  Face Marion.  Okay.  Marion will give you clues.  Is there a time limit on this?  How long?  40 minutes.  60 seconds.  Do we have a timer?  An official timer?  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Ready? 
[02:53:00]  And go.  Things people like to eat.  No.  No.  You fucking retard.  She just said the answer?  You're supposed to give clues to make her say that.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  It couldn't work out more perfectly.  That's all we're hoping for.  That's the whole bit.  That was the answer, right?  What do you think?  What do you think? 
[02:53:30]  Holy shit.  I can't fucking take this.  I was joking.  I can't take this.  Someone know the highlight.  I did it.  No, you don't get another show.  She misunderstood the rule.  Not another show.  Another fucking...  We do know how to play a $25,000 pyramid.  Yeah, we do.  Let's give him another shot.  Because she didn't understand.  All right.  All right.  All right.  She's a blithering idiot.  All right.  We'll do it.  Marion, you don't...  We'll do it one more time.  Marion, you don't read off the answer.  You've got to give clues, and hopefully Lady Di gives the answer.  The object of this game is for her, Lady Di, to say what's on that paper.  You've got to give her clues, but you can't say any of the words in the clue. 
[02:54:00]  Okay?  You got it.  All right.  Take the headphones off.  All right.  Earmuffs again.  Earmuffs.  Earmuffs.  Earmuffs.  Cover your ears.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There you go.  Cover your ears.  Cover your goddamn ears.  Let go of it.  Who cares about the fucking headphones?  Holy shit.  Jim, what are you doing?  Plane's on a plane.  On my underwear?  All right.  This is good.  All right.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[02:54:30]  Just take a picture of a European look.  She's like Isabella Rossellini.  All right, guys.  Lady Di doesn't like her.  How bad is it?  It's up there.  All right.  Got it?  All right, here we go.  Ready and go.  Pilot.  Passengers.  Stewardess.  Airplane.  All right, we'll take that.  Things on an airplane.  Things on an airplane.  See?  Very good.  That was very good.  That's how it works. 
[02:55:00]  All right.  Now we move to the next team.  Yeah.  Is that how it works?  Yeah, Bobo and the other.  All right, get up, ladies.  When she said pilot, I thought it was things Jim Norton doesn't guess.  That's amazing.  Pilot, stewardess.  Yeah, you did great.  You did great.  Co-pilot?  Yep.  You did great.  All right.  I don't fly, but.  You got it.  Bobo, come sit down.  Little tidbits of information.  More about you.  Let's go.  Useless info.  It's amazing.  It is like pop-up video.  Yes, pop-up video.  You get the whole thing and little extras.  It's like this DVD extras. 
[02:55:30]  Bobo, are you ready to meet your partner?  Bobo, are you ready to meet your partner?  Yep, I am.  All right, Bobo, you will be playing with the lovely Jackie the Intern.  Why do I have to look at him?  Exactly.  Where is Jackie the Intern?  She's not around.  Did she quit?  I would.  Here she comes, the lovely Jackie the Intern.  Bobo, do you like Jackie?  Yeah, I think I said, Jack, I said to her that she looks great.  She looks great.  Bobo, why don't you ask her out, man?  Yeah, Bobo.  I would ask her out if she was single. 
[02:56:00]  Oh.  They're having problems on her.  Unfortunately, she's got a guy.  Oh.  They're having issues.  That's terrible.  How long into the conversation did she let you know that?  Yeah, you could take them off and then, like, put your hands over your ears while I give  the thing.  It's like, okay.  I knew because I heard.  Yeah, put your hands over your ears.  There you go.  Things that are funny.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  Put your headphones on.  You ready?  Bobo, you know what you're doing, right? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  You know how this game works?  You give clues.  Don't say the words.  Okay.  Ready?  And go.  Monkeys.  Dogs.  Jimmy.  Things that are fucked Bobo.  A zoo.  Jesus.  Farts.  Things that smell.

Team Bobo and Jackie, 33 seconds.  All right.  That's good.  That's chemistry.  Yeah.  You got a point.  Don't look at Jackie's legs, though, Bobo.  It's disrespectful.  All right.  You can for a second.  Just for a second.  Bobo's having such a hard time concentrating. 
[02:57:30]  Bobo, you got anything going on in your pants right now?  No, that's too disrespectful.  You get an invitation to come out.  All right.  That's too disrespectful.  All right.  Who's up next?  Who's up?  All right.  You guys get up.  All right.  We're changing back over again.  It's...  I know this isn't exactly like the program was.  I want to know how...  To the gargantuan.  I'd like to ask one question in between.  Yeah.  How does Jimmy feel?  How's Jimmy going to feel when he's sitting there trying to write some new, you know, material?  Like, what's going on in the world? 
[02:58:00]  What do I feel about the world?  When he realizes he was in the same category as farts, people slipping, dogs and monkeys in  Bobo's mind.  That's what Bobo finds funny.  It's going to be a little tough.  Monkeys are hilarious.  It's always funny if there's a monkey around.  All right.  I'm here.  Why?  It's more babble.  Oh, Jesus.  He's gold.  I don't want to talk.  Use that microphone.  Oh, that's good.  Okay.  Oh, my God.

Yeah, any table you're sitting on.  What is that? 
[03:00:30]  What does it say?  It says elements on a periodic table, but what is that?  Do you know what the periodic table of elements are?  Gold.  Like the elements.  Like cobalt.  Cobalt.  Lead.  Lead.  Hydrogen.  Boron.  We didn't know that.  Nitrogen.  Boron.  Because she wasn't given enough clues or she didn't understand.  That was apparent when she just said, what was that?  Yes.  All right.  Well, let's move on to the next team.  Sorry, guys.  Sorry.  We don't need a summation.  Take a hike. 
[03:01:00]  You know what was great is even if she was describing this console, they still didn't come close to it.  Yeah.  Like she didn't even say the table or the console or anything.  I don't know what that was.  I did go with my clothes.  You did.  You did great, man.  You were wonderful.  Thank you.  No, first one, you were horrible.  Yeah.  And you had two of them.  You did have two of them in there with water, by the way.  You've got to give her that much.  That's right.  She did have hydrogen and oxygen, so that's not bad.  All right.  Back to Bobo and Jackie.  Bobo and Jackie.  This time, I guess, it's Jackie giving the clues to Bobo.

Those are mean descriptions.  That's what was written on a paper.  No, but the thing was, say nice things about Lady Di. 
[03:04:30]  Chubby cheeks.  I always say nice things about her, but that was written on a paper.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  This is hilarious.  I don't care.  All right.  Marriott and Mary Pickford, if you guys want to sound.  Marriott.  Hey, that was what was written on the paper.  All right.

[03:06:30]  I know.  You're up and down.  It's amazing.  I'm always up and down.  It is very good.  When you started that class, what was it again?  The Zumba?  Zumba.  I started it two weeks ago.  Nice.  It's pretty good.  How does that work?  Good.  Pretty good.  But what do you do?  Yeah, what do you do?  Dance, exercise.  You do it late.  I started out like a small beginner Zumba.  And then maybe now I'll do the medium one.  No, because it goes from the beginner to medium.  Yes, that's how everything goes.  Then a harder workout.  It starts really difficult. 
[03:07:00]  And then by the time you leave, you're pretty much just sitting around smoking cigarettes.  I don't smoke.  Oh, God.  Memorand, I don't smoke.  I smoke.  But I am the one that smokes.  You smoke died.  Listen, can you give us one of those moves?  I want to see one of the moves.  Yeah.  Sure.  Oh, that'd be good.  Show's a difficult move.  Do you get music?  Yeah, they do the music.  What kind of music is Zumba music?  It depends.  Oh, well, she needs them.  It could be like a little disco.  Lady Di needs that.  But what kind of music?  A little disco, a little rap, a little hip hop.  Oh, yeah.  You got some Zumba music in there, Iraq? 
[03:07:30]  I don't even know what that is.  Try some disco.  No, of course you don't.  It's an exercise routine.  It's a picture.  It could actually be.  Oh, but you know what Zumba is.  I don't know.  You go to the gym, guys.  You know what Zumba is.  What song would you want on Zumba to?  It doesn't matter.  I don't want it to hip hop.  Some hardcore rap.  He walked right the fucking rap.  It's like a hip hop or disco thing.  Oh, we rock.  Then mix it up.  Get a dance song.  Something fucking.  Yeah, yeah.  Something good.  Something good.  Some Latin stuff.  Yeah.  I don't.  No.  It ain't Latin. 
[03:08:00]  You said hip hop.  What do you guys.  All right.  Some hip hop.  Exactly.  Jesus.  But I got to do it standing up.  We know.  You don't do Zumba sitting down.  We know.  Put your headphones on so you can hear it.  Oh, my God.  Stand up.  Put your headphones on so you can hear it and stand up.  Get ready for some Zumba.  I want to see some Zumba.  Yeah.  He rock.  I'm looking for some music.  Put hip hop on.  Oh, there we go.  Is this fast enough?  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  It's kind of slow.  It's kind of slow.  Yeah.  You like it faster.  I mean, we're rolling.  They got fired from all this place.  The ladies are moving.  That's why I keep on working.  Oh, there she goes.  Oh.  This is what you do at the gym.  Look at her go.  This is good.  This is one step above Prince her size.  She's just kind of dancing left to right.  It's really good.  And that's a complicated move, huh? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me do that for 45 minutes.  I bet they'd be a hell of a workout.  Sure.  Burning a bunch of calories right there.  Very good, man.  Actually, that's what they do.  Yeah.  And then they go faster.  Then you got to do a little more of this.  A little more arm workout.  And then you got to really move your legs a little bit more.  Yeah, yeah.  It's about a 45-minute class.  And then you get up.  Then when you're done, you do whatever you want to do.  The machines.  The last day, they play Flight of the Bumblebee, and you all fall down.  You do what you want after that.  I go to Lucille Roberts, guys.  Oh. 
[03:09:30]  Okay.  Lucille Roberts, of course.  And their main office is right here in Manhattan.  Cool.  Oh, wow.  We needed to know that.  Why does that?  Jackie, what's their P.O. box number?  No, because if you know somebody who would like to join, they do have gyms around here  somewhere.  I bet they give you a break on your membership and you get somebody to join?  No.  I pay $6 a month.  Oh, that's not bad.  That's it.  $5, $6.  That's not bad.  That's not bad at all.  If you use it, a lot of people pay.  They don't even go.  I go three grams a week.  $6 a month? 
[03:10:00]  I started at $13.  $60.  And then they lowered it to $6.  I've been going like $6.  Wait, $6 a month?  Yep, right now, $6 a month.  That's not bad.  It's crazy.  Not bad.  That's not bad.  Thank you for that, Lady Di.  What does it take you and Chris Lady Di?  I don't know, right?  Wow, she knows, though.  Who did you have to blow to get that deal?  Whoa!  Marion, you're going to take that?  Oh, Bobo.  I don't have to blow nobody because that's what Eddie takes charge. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah!  Ah, Bobo.  She's on fire.  She fucking got you, Bobo.  That sounds too cheap for a gym.  No, it's not.  I thought it was going to go, Joe.  He's saying what we're all thinking.  And you stay as long as you want, but you look like you can use a little bit of it.  Oh!  She's on fire today.  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy.  I guess you don't have anything to say back to that, Bobo.  I only recently started working out.  Oh! 
[03:11:00]  It's a nice, reasonable comeback.  A long, long way to go.  The comeback's thought out.  Believe me, this isn't fat.  There's a lot worse.  Yeah.  There's a lot worse.  I think that was an Irish slam.  All right.  Are we back to the game?  Are we going to do another game or what?  Yes, Carl.  I know you guys don't do line of the day anymore, but so far the line of the day was Marion to  Bob Levy.  We're not cunts, but you might be a dick.  I thought I was still going to give the clues. 
[03:11:30]  No, Diana.  That is gold.  That was better at giving the clues.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Cover your ears.  Don't look at me.  Yeah.  Lady Di, you're doing a good job.  Look over there.  All right.  You're doing great.  You're doing great.  Yes.  Men, I've blown.  Here you go.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  My ex-husband.  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  Wait.  No, no, no. 
[03:12:00]  All right.  Jimmy?  Whoa!  Jimmy!  No, no, no.  Not you.  Not you.  Not you.  What?  Mike?  Mike?  Your ex-boyfriends.  Well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One way.  No, no.  Keep going.  Your ex-lovers.  More names.  More names.  I don't think I have any more names to tell you.  Yes, you do.  All right.  All right.  Jimmy.  Okay.  Mike.  Guys you used to have sex with. 
[03:12:30]  Freddie.  Freddie.  Close.  You're close.  Who was the homeless guy?  Uh.  None of those guys were homeless guys.  Right.  That's the problem.  No, right.  All right.  Jimmy.  Mike.  Freddie.  Guys you had sex with, Diana.  You're getting close.  You're getting close.  All right.  Keep going.  Guys you fooled around with.  Guys you had sex with.  Guys you blew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Guys, she's blown. 
[03:13:00]  She works blue.  She works blue.  Yeah.  It's B-L-E-W.  Guys you blew.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  I remember when it was a blowjobs.  What was the thing to say?  Whoa.  Hey.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  You've changed from those cruises.  Tom in the balcony of those cruises got a little saucy.  Not you, Jim.  Yes.  Right, right.  I know.  We figured that out.  I'm like, why?  Whoa.  We'll scare her there.  Jim is a very common name.  He was one.  He was one.  She's right.  She is right.  She is right.  That was factual. 
[03:13:30]  Yes.  There's a lot of facts being thrown around in a tank, by the way.  We learned today that Jim is a very common name.  Okay.  The game ends with all of us hanging ourselves in the bathroom.  It gets to $25,000.  I guess we have to.  Well, you need a winning team, and then they get to do the final thing.  I'm like, wait a seven foot down.  All right.  Let's go, Bobo.  Bobo, come on.  What the hell is Bobo?  Look, Jackie's getting annoyed.  She's like, Bobo, come on.  Diane Marion did not get the elements one.  Well, they did.  That was a tough one.  So far, Bobo and Jackie are winning. 
[03:14:00]  So if Bobo and Jackie get this correct, they will go on to the bonus round.  The bonus round.  Right, right.  All right.  This is dedicated to two friends of mine on Twitter.  We're Bobo editor and Linz.  I think Linz is on the phone before.  I am team Linz.  Team Linz.  Nice.  Again, you're trying to get a relationship going.  Actually, she's a friend of mine.  Oh, yeah?  There's no relationship with me.  I'm going to stab myself with this plastic fork right in my carotid artery.  Have you ever dedicated this segment again? 
[03:14:30]  Dedicating a segment.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Who's giving the clues?  Bobo's giving the clues.  Okay.  Bobo will be giving the clues.  So we need Jackie to cover her ears once again.  Earmuffs.  Oh, very good.  The clues you'll be giving.  Things your dick does.  All right, Bobo.  All right, Bobo.  You got that one.  Go. 
[03:15:00]  Jackie's putting on.  Go.  All right.  Grow hair.  Splooge.  Cum.  Things your dick do.  Yay!  Oh, man.  These guys.  They are good.  They are good.  A match made in heaven.  Dick Clark would be so proud right now if he wasn't rotting away.  Things that happened during a Mets victory.  Wow.  So I guess you two are the big winners.  This is my new quiz show. 
[03:15:30]  I'd like an inquiry why they got the hard clues.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Periodic table.  Periodic table did fuck them up.  I think they just win.  They just, everyone wins.  We don't have to do any more.  I know.  Everybody's a winner.  That's all you need.  The bonus round is crazy anyway.  Oh, boy.  Everybody's a damn winner in this game.  Wow.  What'd you say, Marion?  I get a bottle of wine for winning away.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to be a bottle of wine.  She's got a good point.  Yeah.  Well, you're going to christen Lady Di before she leaves. 
[03:16:00]  See, she's a battleship.  She don't drink wine no more.  I got to leave Lady Di alone.  She gave me a good shot during the break.  Lady Di, what did you say about Opie during the break?  Yeah.  Into the mic.  Me?  No, the other Lady Di.  Yes, you.  There you go, Lady Di.  Here.  Exactly.  True.  I don't want to say this.  Just go ahead.  He asked for it.  It's all right. 
[03:16:30]  It's an observation.  I apologize.  You look like a sumo wrestler.  I do.  All right.  Wait.  No, no, no.  The only thing I said was he put on a little weight, but I am sorry that I said that.  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  He still looks good.  And Anthony still looks good.  That's kind of mean.  Yeah, he looked real good.  I like that.  I get the adjective before.  He's got a lot of weight.  You said since being.  Colin Quinn, you lost a hell of a lot of weight, too.  You look great.  You know.  It'll be put on a couple.  I don't know when he had other guys.  It was hurtful.  Lady Di, people that live in glass slaughterhouses. 
[03:17:00]  People that live in glass boxes.  Oh, Lady Di.  Oh, my God.  You chugged that water.  Are you feeling okay now?  Yeah, I'm all right.  Into the mic.  What happened?  What happened to her?  Goes right through her, that water.  What happened to her?  It was just a little hot in here.  It's hot in here.  Oh, boy.  It's getting hot in here.  Hot flashes, huh?  You getting some flashes and some menopause happening?  Holy shit.  Your body runs like an old rambler.  It's just backfiring stuff out of her vagina. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, Lady Di.  What a nice.  What a day.  This has been so much fun, by the way.  This has been the greatest.  How many years?  Yeah.  Great.  This is Summer Union.  Let me tell you something.  It's great.  You guys missed us.  Oh, we missed you so much.  How many years?  This is a great studio.  We'll have you back in another seven.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You have seven.  Book it now.  You'll have to call me from downtown River somewhere.  When Lady Di starts talking about getting a job again.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Yeah, what's going on with the job, Lady Di? 
[03:18:00]  Come on.  I did apply in places.  Do you guys have a job here that she could do?  She can clean.  Oh, boy.  Have her clean the bathrooms or the offices.  I do maintenance work.  I'll clean.  I'll pour time at night.  Yeah.  Yeah?  What do you think?  Do you scrub the toilets with your underarm hair?  No.  No, I don't do stuff like that.  Yeah, but I do clean the toilet.  Oh, there she is answering.  Of course.  Answering the joke again.  Like, there's people that do do that stuff.  I don't do stuff like that.  Yeah. 
[03:18:30]  Marion, what do you think she should do job-wise?  Marion, comment?  She should be out there.  I mean, believe me, I know it's tough, because especially if you live in Elizabeth, it really  is.  That's where Rich Voss is from.  You can't.  You are.  I mean, I know, because around Christmas time, it's hard, but she should be out there even  more.  Like, maybe once or twice a week, try to find something.  She's basically saying she's a lazy lump.  But she should go out there.  She's been a cashier.  She's smart.  She could do computers.  But you just got to have, she just has to have more motivation. 
[03:19:00]  Marion looks like if Miss Crabtree from Little Rascals was on 22nd.  Three times our own gravity planet.  I'll be back out there again.  Out there again.  Again.  Sounds like a ball player.  I'll be out there again.  Rotating.  Exactly.  And she's built like Babe Ruth.  This is what I'm always hiring.  You know.  Are you ever going to point over the fence and then hit a home run again?  Oh, fuck, man.  Fucking A.  Jesus.  You guys, this was great. 
[03:19:30]  You guys loved it.  Yeah, it was terrific.  It's fucking fantastic.  Come on.  Yeah.  Who's kidding who here?  This has been a blast today.  Bobo, you have fun today.  Bobo, there you go.  Three hours.  How does it feel?  It was an honor to be here today.  And especially to be here with this historic event, the return of Lady Di and Marion.  Very true.  Thank you.  Very well put.  A historic event.  Yes, yes.  We'll be back up here.  You know, it's odd.  But all three of them are more well-spoken than yesterday's prosecution witness for Zimmerman trial. 
[03:20:00]  Come on.  Maybe we try to get Patty up here.  How's Patty?  Has Patty been up here lately?  She wouldn't come in.  She's got a problem with you.  She's working.  She doesn't like you guys.  And she doesn't like you guys.  She said you hogged the mic.  Yeah.  I don't know.  She said you hogged the mic.  She's not a fan.  And that she didn't want to be around you because you guys hogged the mic and you're rude.  Yep.  Not us.  Yeah.  At least not me.  She said both of you.  Both.  We thought it was just Lady Di, but it was both of you.  And she only accumulated a minute so far.  All right.  Good one.  Callback.  That's a callback.  Absolutely.  I would have liked to talk to Patty when she was on the phone. 
[03:20:30]  See how she is.  Well, we tried, but she said that if you're going to be here, she won't come in.  No, no, no, Jim.  We haven't seen her in how many years.  I don't know.  And I know she was basically on the show more than we have been.  And she isn't part of the show more than we have been.  Put a $100 bill in a card for a friend.  Say something.  Between friends.  Jesus.  And I know she was living around here in Manhattan.  Well, we still like her.  We still like her.  She's an S-I-N-Y.  I'm just glad that she's still doing good.  I don't know if she works at Starbucks.  Lady Di lifted her arm. 
[03:21:00]  I thought it was a 1969 penthouse.  Yeah.  Because believe it, she had her issues too at one time.  I like that look.  It's like the European.  She's got like the Jean-Luc Godard type movie.  And Patty, if you're listening, I still like you and I hope to talk to you soon.  All right.  She was bad mouthing you guys.  No.  This is their version.  This is our version of, you know, like they go to the monkeys reunion.  Yeah.  This is like the Opie and Anthony version.  Yes.  Version of the reunion.  Yeah.  Reunion.  Got to get Patty up here.  And then double.  What the hell's the name? 
[03:21:30]  Double A.  Double A.  Double A.  Double bypass.  No.  Last year, I was at South Street C4.  And I was at this bar down there.  They were having some big barbecue thing.  And the main one has the one over there.  It's like $5 to get in.  What was the temperature of the coals?  He noticed me.  Exactly.  How much was the cab?  No, no.  He was there hanging out partying with people that were there.  Double A.  Big A.  He had me on the shoulder and said, wait a minute, I know I know you.  And right away, he said, wait a minute, you're marrying. 
[03:22:00]  And I'm like, yeah.  So we started yapping away.  And then what happened?  He was like, oh my God.  What happened after that?  Yapping away?  I can't imagine it.  He recognized me.  I didn't recognize who he was.  But what happened after that?  What happened after that?  We started talking.  I had a drink.  What did you talk about?  He brought me a drink.  I brought him a drink.  And then I drank.  And then we said goodbye.  Did him and Lady Di start orbiting each other?  Sounds like Kathy Moriarty.  She had a drink.  She had a drink.  He told me he still sees you guys once in a while.  Oh, yeah.  He said he still drives a cab.  Oh, that's good.  But I don't know if he's from the Bronx or Brooklyn. 
[03:22:30]  I don't really know.  Oh, you really caught up in here.  You don't know?  He was the only person.  What's a zip code?  Do you have a zip code?  Maybe you can recite that.  Exactly.  What are the high prices of gases?  How are they affecting you economically?  Quickly.  Quickly.  You know, half hour or less.  Jesus.  Yeah.  All right.  Any final thoughts there?  It was great.  It was fun.  And we had a good time.  And we know what?  We love you guys.  And you know something?  I had the satellite.  And I listen to you guys all the time.  Yeah.  But Opie, you know why I can't call you? 
[03:23:00]  What color are the digital numbers that come up on the fucking unit?  I get everything work right 630.  We love you guys.  Got any material on tire valve stems?  And we just love being up here.  Let's do 40 minutes.  I knew you were doing okay.  Huh?  You're not doing that well, though.  We're afraid for you.  Yeah.  Well, I'll lose the weight.  Oh.  And I'm doing great.  You're a goddamn disaster.  You've got to do something about yourself.  You drink too much.  You're all puffy.  And you're fucking...  What's with the gun? 
[03:23:30]  Your underarms look like a 14-year-old girl's vagina.  It's got to be fucking fixed.  Can we see your underarms?  I have something attractive on her.  I can't see my underarms.  Can I see your underarms?  Just lift it up.  No.  It's the grand finale of the appearance.  Come on.  It is.  Oh, just as a goofball.  Pull down the sleeve.  Pull the sleeve down.  It should be an ad for Dollar Shave Club.  Oh, good thing.  I can't see.  Hey, Bubba, why don't you show on her underarms how you would lick a girl's vagina?  That's a great idea, Bubba.  I forgot to shave for a couple of days.  It's a great idea.  Why don't you lick her underarms the way you would a vagina?  That's a great idea. 
[03:24:00]  Lady Di would like that.  I don't know if it's a great idea, like a Tesla great idea.  I think it's one.  Okay.  It's a terrific idea.  Hold on, now.  Lady Di, you're going to lick your armpits.  Lady Di, stand up.  Come on, Mike, Bubba.  Like Eli Whitney didn't come up with this one as far as great ideas go.  Yes, Eli Dim Whitney.  Let's do this, Bubba.  Lady Di, stand up, please.  Lady Di, stand up.  Come sit in the chair.  Grand finale.  Come sit in the chair of honor. 
[03:24:30]  Bubba is going to take a couple of little licks at your underarm like he would a vagina.  No, it's gross.  Come on.  Come on.  No.  What's wrong with that?  We'll give you some money.  It's fine.  He wants to do it.  Look at him.  We'll give you some money.  He's chomping at the bit.  And so are you.  I guess she's suiting up to leave.  What is she doing?  Yeah, sit to the mic.  Talk to the mic.  Is she saying no?  Is she...  Hold on.  Is she saying no?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Just now lift your arm and pull your sleeve away.  What?  Hold on.  Bobo.  Someone's got to mic Bobo. 
[03:25:00]  What's the matter?  Lift your arm.  Pull your sleeve away.  Bobo.  Yeah, lick your arm.  Get in there, Bobo.  Of course, bear in mind, I've never licked a vagina before, so I don't...  Well...  We're going to show you, Bobo, how to lick a vagina.  You could tongue one, but you'll never really...  Marry it.  Put these on.  Hold on, hold on.  You didn't really do this.  Could you at least play a monkey song?  A monkey song.  Hold on.  We got Who Kid in here.  Who Kid?  Who Kid wants to say hi to you guys?  Who?  Yeah, exactly.  It's Who Kid.  Don't be afraid.  That's Who Kid.  Don't be afraid.

They don't like cruises very much.  It's a bad time.  Niggas can't swim.  What's your name again?  Very hard accommodations on those first few cruises.  Like, if we have a pool party, nobody's in the pool.  Everybody's just outside dancing along the pool.  You go back on cruises.  You ever been on a cruise?  I've been on, what, that Circle Line shit.  That's about it.  The one that goes around Manhattan.  You gotta go to Bahamas. 
[03:29:30]  I saw the statue, nigga.  You gotta go to Bahamas or Bermuda or St. Martin or St. Martin.  You gotta go to St. Troy, St. Kate.  I saw him from Haiti only once, and that's it.  You gotta do all the islands.  Let me tell you, once you do a cruise, you'll be hooked.  For real?  Yes, for real.  They say it's like an old white people wiggling.  Well, that's what's happening in here today, too.  When she bent, I saw leather.  Did you?  In her bra, like.  No, it was just her chest.  I think she's like an African descent, the way her boobs are saying. 
[03:30:00]  Don't you leave them for all on the beach.  No, no, we leave right on Bayonne.  Marion.  I'm not listening to him.  Unbelievable.  Cruise port in Bayonne off of 14B.  In February or Bayonne?  They have their own conversation.  Yeah.  The first two.  Hey, you're Norton.  What's going on here?  It's just exhausting.  The ship leaves and the pirate boat comes in.  Oh, shit.  I don't know what you're saying.  I'm just getting the shit out of me.  He looked at Diane and scared the shit out of me. 
[03:30:30]  You're leaving me hanging, girl.  Yeah, come on.  Do you like the black guys, Lady Diane?  Oh, yeah.  You want to go to a monkey's concert with Diane?  A monkey's concert?  What?  That's racist right here, please.  It's because I'm here.  M-O-N-K-D-E-S.  I'm getting hung from every angle.  She explains it's the other one.  Right, right.  Other monkeys.  She spelled the monkey's concert.  Oh, the monkeys.  I think we're thankful that Bobo's mic isn't really up for what he just said. 
[03:31:00]  What did he say?  I don't know.  I think it'd be funny if these two went to the monkey jungle in Miami not knowing that monkeys would...  Listen to the monkey's concert.  Louder, Bobo.  No, I don't want to go.  Say it louder.  It would be funny if these two went to the monkey jungle and accidentally got poos flinged on them.  Well said, Bobo.  Good phrasing.  You guys are looking at things in the front of me.  I'll fight some shit, Bobo.  Yeah, you should have used that for a clue.  You guys are the shit.  Oh, my God. 
[03:31:30]  This is...  I don't want me to tell you, though.  She listens to my show.  She's actually a fan.  She just told me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You got Shade 45 or whatever.  Yes, yes.  You listen to the whole kid.  I don't...  You want a dirty dance with who can?  I listen to all the...  Oh, man.  You want to do a little dirty dance with who can?  Oh, bravo.  If you get off the radio, I switch it.  Oh, okay.  To hip-hop...  I'll make sure I tell Rana Fez that.  I'm loving her mouth right now.  I don't know why.  Oh, moisture.  We're going to go out for a drink.  Yeah.  Maybe we can drink some Ciroc or something. 
[03:32:00]  Everybody's like Ciroc.  Yeah?  Everybody I know like Ciroc.  I know that's a famous vodka.  No, it's Puff Daddy's liquid.  It's a famous vodka, yes.  It's a famous vodka.  Yeah, yeah, vodka.  I've had it.  Vodka, grapefruit, cranberry, cranberry, parties.  Vodka, coke.  I like the rum and coke.  You still haven't admitted to...  Yes.  I'm a diet coke.  You still haven't admitted to dating a virgin.  Popcorn shrimp, barbecue shrimp.  It's just endless.  Damn, she's still a virgin, yo.  She doesn't have had a black drink.  Oh, man. 
[03:32:30]  No, he means as far as black guys go.  I've been married for 19 years.  Did you ever cheat on your husband?  No.  Never.  Wow.  You're a lucky guy, yo.  Would you ever?  No.  I got him married.  Why would I?  I just saw you sitting on Colin's lap with his fucking arm around him.  What's that mean?  What's that mean?  You think Joe would like that?  My husband met Colin Quinn years ago.  That's right.  Yeah, he met Joe.  I love Colin Quinn.  Yeah.  I like her mouth.  Was it a cuck party? 
[03:33:00]  A cuck party?  Was he prepping Colin?  Yeah, exactly.  Was he servicing Colin's balls with his mouth?  Hey, Joe, I told you.  Oh, thank God.  Colin filled your Muppet vagina with an Irish dick.  This is like so odd.  This is like the weirdest shit I've ever walked into.  I feel like I'm in a nigga Twilight Zone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why aren't you getting involved in the conversation, Lady Di?  I think Barry's doing a pretty good job right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really don't have that much bully to talk about. 
[03:33:30]  Say something to WhoKid.  What do you got for WhoKid?  What's his name?  New kid?  Are you Commando right now?  What do you mean Commando?  Like no panties.  Uh-oh.  You didn't hear what happened before.  It's like 100 days outside.  She either came or had her period before.  She was talking before.  She turned around to her friend and said,  I think I just got my friend.  What?  Period.  And then Heather B. gave her a pad.  Heather B. gave her a pad.  She goes to the bathroom, realizes she wasn't bleeding.  But she said she had a clear discharge.  Exactly.  So she came in her fucking panties. 
[03:34:00]  Wouldn't you think that's normal?  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to get it.  What?  What?  Wouldn't you think that's normal?  Not while standing in a radio studio, no.  She had a discharge.  I'm Commando right now.  Your glasses are on your face like George Zimmerman was wearing them that night.  Fucking.  They're all crooked and bent up.  What?  Your glasses are all fucked up.  She's young also, right?  She's young too.  Why?  Yeah, Anthony's the worst.  I never.  I didn't get more glasses.  I didn't see him with glasses on. 
[03:34:30]  See who?  George Zimmerman.  I don't even know what you guys are talking about.  I don't know what I said.  I'm talking to him.  He told me something different.  That's the guy that's on trial right now.  Oh, I don't.  She watches the news?  You watch the news.  I don't.  She watches the news and she watches the game shows.  After I get out of work, I go home, do what I got to do home, and then I'm off to the gym, off to the park somewhere.  Eight o'clock.  Shopping.  I walk the mall.  I'm over here.  I walk the mall.  I walk the mall.  She walks the mall.  I'm in awe right now.  I'm like, lost.  Get this dunderhead back from the bathroom so he can lick her armpits and we can go. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, we don't even have to do that.  Oh, I want to see that.  I want to see that.  All right, Lady Di, here's what's going to happen.  It's sexy.  Here's what's going to happen.  Welcome Bobo.  Hurry up.  Bobo's going to come back in here.  You're going to lift your fucking arm, show the pit.  Which arm?  He's going to go.  Let Bobo.  You and Bobo work it out.  Try to figure out which one.  And then we're going to go. 
[03:35:30]  That was hilarious.  And we're going to go home.  Yeah, she'll keep talking through the whole thing.  Of course.  Just yammers.  Colin's just sitting there entertaining every word.  It's not poor Colin.  He's loving this.  He's captivated.  He loves this.  He loves this.  I hear what a daily day.  We're going to go out to lunch after this.  Me and me.  Where did Bobo go?  We're going to go out to lunch.  I don't want Bobo.  I want to go out to lunch.  Bobo in the middle of the show ran out to take a shit.  Who can?  Who can?  Who can?  You're going to go out to lunch with us? 
[03:36:00]  He's in the stall pushing.  I'm on Sammy's show after.  I don't know what show is.  I'm on Sammy's show after.  Here he comes.  Oh, Sam.  Sam Roberts.  Bobo, what happened?  What happened, Bobo?  Bobo.  I had to go to the bathroom really bad.  Why'd you leave the show?  I drank so much.  I drank a dump.  Hold on.  Shut up.  What happened?  What happened?  I drank so much water.  Yeah.  It was shit, though.  It was shit.  But it was shit. 
[03:36:30]  Go ahead, Marion.  So that also kind of happened.  Bobo, it's in your hand.  So you're shit.  Yeah.  It was a watery shit.  Go ahead, Marion.  Oh, no.  Thank God I'm not a Mets fan.  Shit.  I felt that.  It was already at the point where I couldn't hold it anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'll happen.  Bobo, tell Who Kid about your special news about the Mets.  He got some good news today about the Mets.  Oh, yeah.  What's going to happen?  Lady Di has a good question. 
[03:37:00]  I want a Yankee fan.  I want a Yankee fan.  That's what she took away from all this.  I want a Yankee fan in her mouth.  Am I the only Yankee fan in here?  No, Anthony, you're a Yankee fan.  No.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Why is she in overdrive now?  Lady Di is a Yankee fan.  She's in overdrive now.  She kicked in now.  I think it's because of Who Kid.  She's very excited.  Oh, she is.  Who Kid's in here.  That Mouth.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Now, Bobo.  This is the greatest. 
[03:37:30]  First of all, I want to make sure you remember.  What did Colin say he's going to hook you up with?  He's working on trying to get me tickets to the All-Star game with Jerry.  Why can't you go to the final tickets?  Jerry who?  Jerry who?  Jerry Seinfeld.  Yes.  Get the fuck out of here.  He's going to the game of Jerry Seinfeld.  And Jerry Seinfeld at the All-Star game.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Just remember to tweet, Colin and Jerry, because he forgets everything.  Marion gave Jerry Seinfeld the huh.  I know.  What's that about?  I'm not a big Seinfeld fan.  Yeah, not many people liked the show. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I used to watch it, but not that much.  It doesn't do well in syndication fucking 20 years later.  I've got the one with Jerry Seinfeld to the man who made it possible for Colin to have  that wonderful boy show he had.  OBSC, my watching TV is about a half hour every night.  What half hour do you watch?  Maybe Channel 12 News, maybe for a half hour.  12 News?  She saw you on that, Jimmy.  I know, I know. 
[03:38:30]  Very popular with the ladies.  I watched the replay, the repeat of John Mahatma.  Jimmy is fucking just as stupid.  You watch the half hour, she's at the gym, she's doing stuff.  I'm always doing stuff afterwards.  I hear ya.  Too many people watch TV all day nowadays.  Hey, would you let Who Kid fill you up?  It's not cheating.  No, I don't know.  He's been looking at your boobies.  I don't want nobody to fill me up.  This is like leather.  Oh, I don't want to fuck.  I have dance with him.  I saw her when she bent over and she's brawless.  You'll dance with him?  There's leather in there.  I'm married.  I don't have nobody to fill me up.  She's married.  Dirty dancing, though?  If he tries to fill me up, I'm... 
[03:39:00]  That's not cheating.  You'll head on the side of my back.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You can fill Diane up now, don't you?  Go ahead.  You want him to fill you up?  I can fill her up if she was.  Yeah, she would like that.  You want to take a little grab?  Yeah, squeeze.  Let me try to fill her up.  Yeah, let's do this.  Go ahead.  Oh, man.  Let's see.  What do we got?  What do we got?  All right.  I think her titty just moved.  Oh, man.  Nice.  There we go.  The kid's rubbing the legs.  He's got to lose weight up here.  Rubbing the legs a little. 
[03:39:30]  He's working like turntables.  He's rubbing the legs.  What about the stomach and the breasts?  Come on.  You got to feel it.  Oh, yeah.  How's that feel?  No, feel the breasts.  You're not feeling the breasts.  Feel the breasts.  That feels good.  Are they breasts?  I'm so confused right now.  You sound pretty damn good.  Feel the breasts.  Go ahead.  It's like a reversal molestation.  I don't know.  I'm being molested.  How old are you?  Your hands are being molested.  My hands are like spicy right now.  How old are you?  I'm 41. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, so, well, she's 51.  Oh, are you?  Well, fucking Marion just keeps throwing her under the bus.  She's got all this weight up there.  She's got all this weight.  She's 51.  I was going to say that when you were halfway, then I'm playing out with how.  Yeah, I know, but she's trying to cock walk you.  But she did start getting aroused when I went in between her Moses split.  Why do you feel the breasts?  Lady Di, how did that feel?  That felt good?  It felt nice.  Was it from being feared by an African fellow?  It's been a long time.  It's been a long time.  I like the fact she's directly on it.  It felt nice.  It felt nice. 
[03:40:30]  Would you like him to do you?  OB's the worst.  Has it been a while?  It's been a while.  Oh, boy.  That's some hot shit right there.  All right, Bobo's going to lick her armpits now.  You shot a volley out of your fucking pussy before.  We understand it's been a while.  All right, here goes Bobo.  Here we go.  The hair he's getting in there.  It's kind of like there's a European thing.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Come on, it's good.  Damn, he's eating like he's eating pussy.  No, no, keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  How's it feel?  Keep going.  How's it feel, Diana?  He's not even throwing up.  Bobo, what's it taste like?  Diane, you need to shave. 
[03:41:00]  Bobo, what's it taste like?  You need to go buy a razor.  Bobo, what's it taste like?  What's it taste like, Bobo?  Bobo, I don't know.  It tastes like freaking like hair.  That's a good point.  A lot of good points today.  Good point.  There's been a lot of points that a lot of people might find obvious in their titties,  but in this show, it's almost the Xan.  Jesus.  Anti-radium radio.  Jimmy's all ready to go.  I am, too.  I got to get out of here. 
[03:41:30]  I got fucking dirty shit.  I got a trainer coming over.  You guys got to go, like, work out.  Anthony, you got to go get the pool ready for some other.  Yeah, we got shit to do.  I got shit to do.  I never saw Jim so disgusted.  He's a little disgusted.  A little bit.  Hey, I listen.  You think I don't listen.  I have to.  All right.  We know.  But you can't call me.  You have to be aware of it by 6.30.  Yes.  It's an audio assault.  It really is.  It's terrible.  I defy anyone to see a better radio show than what happened here today.  Oh, man.  Are you going to help him get the pool ready? 
[03:42:00]  No.  Why is she going to do that?  Marion's zeroing in on this whole thing.  I know.  I'm not alone with her.  She helps you get the pool ready.  Yeah, you're right.  Get the pool ready.  I have people that do that, Marion.  She's a nice person.  She's wonderful.  Get her, Marion.  She wouldn't mind how pretty much I hate her house.  I got people that come over.  I got Mexicans that come over and get the pool ready.  Get her, Marion.  Don't let them change your subject, Marion.  That's real racism doing that.  I have a pool ready.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  They know what they're doing.  You didn't know what they were doing.  Believe me.  There are lawn ornaments I got to hide when certain people come over. 
[03:42:30]  Air conditioning guys come over.  Put away the fucking lawn jockey.  The Mexicans are there.  Put away the fucking old Jose right in the burrow.  Hey, Anthony.  Remember a month ago?  Oh, Jesus.  I think we just walked out.  Just let them continue.  Yeah.  I remember that.  You got on.  She's got serious, you know.  I was listening, and I was laughing.  Yeah?  Because I even said, about the people, I was supposed to get your pool ready.  You turn around, you even said, Opie, I don't think they know what they were doing.  You should reiterate that again.  They were going to get the pool ready by Memorial Day. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, and now she's helping them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll have a take for you.  I got a question for you.  I got a question for you.  Carl, thank you.  I got a question.  Nice.  Colin, you're a magical man.  I loved having you here.  Guys, I'm honored to be here for today.  It was fantastic.  It was great.  I miss you, Colin.  Couldn't have picked a better day.  I was going to ask you.  Everybody did a great job.  I wish she let me take her daughter out to the pool.  Thank you very much.  I don't have no kids.  No?  Oh, shit.  Baron?  What happened?  What happened?  Fucking awful. 
[03:43:30]  All right.  All right.  Take it easy.  Her room is like that warehouse that Tony Soprano tried to buy.  You want to know what happened?  Yeah, Jim.  Oh, my friend.  I don't want it.  I don't want it at all.  I love what's on Jim's so furious.  I love it.  Anti-social comedy, July 20th.  One show has been added.  Myself, Amy Schumer, Artie Lang, and Dave Attell.  The late show is available in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  And you guys just do whatever the fuck you want.  I never saw Jim so disgusted ever in my life, yo. 
[03:44:00]  He wants no more to do with this today.  And I don't blame him.  If I didn't have to pack up this computer, I'd have ran myself.  Unbelievable.  I didn't yell, man.  We want to come back.  Hopefully next month.  I don't know, man.  I don't know if you guaranteed your return.  Travis will get and give everyone's phone numbers.  I'll give you my email.  You're the one that I talked to last time.  That's right.  I'm on Facebook with you, but you never Facebook me. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, I don't?  I barely do any Facebooking anymore.  I wrote you happy birthday.  Oh, thank you.  If you check me, if you put Marian Adessa in my Facebook page, I'm happy to be.  You're saying, man.  All right.  This is like the weirdest shit I ever walked into.  I told you it was chaos.  A few months ago, there was a girl, Carolyn, that Facebooked you.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah, because you said, I remember Marian from the show years ago.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I get a lot of Facebooks.  And I said, yeah.  And E-Rock was here.  E-Rock didn't want me.  Oh, that's fucked up, man.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  All right.  Okay, Diana, now you don't mind me. 
[03:45:00]  All right.  Kelly had my hand between her fucking...  Get me the fuck out of here.  All right, have fun with the after show.  Okay.  What, what?  Oh, take care.  Don't turn these mics off yet.  So good seeing you girls again.  Wow, that is one clammy hand.  Wow, your hand is sweaty.  Oh, God.  All right, now clear the way because I'm going home.  I'm going with you.  I'm going to definitely take out the pool.  Nah, I don't think so.  I got things to do at home.  We got a pool party to go, Ian.  All right.  Yeah, we need your address. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, man.  Man, what a weird day in the O&A establishment.  I'll see you on the 6th.  Thanks, Bobo.  This guy's a weirdo, man.  Who, kid?  The ladies are calling you.  Oh.  Huh?  What?  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  This is like the weirdest shit ever, man.  What was that?  And Bobo's still just standing in the room.  Yeah.  Wait, just sit in it for a second. 
[03:46:00]  Just.  You feel that?  You feel that silence?  Finally.  It's back in your life.  Okay.  Jesus.  Everybody stay tuned.  Well, boy, what's going on now?  Do I have a camera?  Oh.  You should film it on your iPhone.  Yeah, well, iPhone video is almost as good as a camcorder.  It's in an elevator.  It's well lit.  All right. 
[03:46:30]  Look, we're going to be back after Opie and Anthony Live continues, or starts, I should  say, after this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  After ONA Live is next.  SiriusXM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:47:00]  How do you follow that?  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  Now, you know, usually when they clean up the studio after a show, it's like a very quick  thing.  They just come in, replace some headphones, get some papers off the desk, and they're out.  I mean, they're not still cleaning when the show's on the air, but I don't know.  There was something just about the debauchery and the debacle that was today's show that  has left this place looking like an atomic bomb has gone off.  And we didn't even do any, like, stunts. 
[03:47:30]  Bobo is still here.  However, he's all the way across the room for some reason.  You coming up?  You going to come into the table, Bobo?  You feeling confident?  Yep, ma'am.  Well, I have to admit right now, I'm still dealing with the aftertaste out of whatever  deodorant Lady Di was wearing.  Well, that's what you did today, Bobo.  You, uh, you licked Lady Di's hairy armpit.  Was it indeed hairy?  I guess maybe it was stubble.  It was just stubble that you were, you were, you were licking.  Yeah, but the deodorant freaking, at least, a horrible aftertaste. 
[03:48:00]  Was that a little, uh, little, uh, armpit hiccup you did there?  Tastes a little armpit when the air came up?  Still, slosh around the saliva in your mouth.  Slosh it around a little bit.  Let me hear it.  Ugh.  How does that taste?  Like armpits?  Ugh, it's horrible aftertaste.  You know what you could have done?  When they said, uh, when they said, hey, Bobo, now you lick Lady Di's armpits, you could  have been like, no, thank you.  Well, I only, I, I did it for the show. 
[03:48:30]  That's good to know.  Let me start taking some calls and go to 303.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam, this is Jack.  I think Bobo proved that he can go on that bus tour.  Bobo.  You didn't bring that up once.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You've been campaigning for so long to get back on this show.  When was the last time you were on the show?  Well, the last time I was on the Open Anthony show was during the trip to Cleveland.  That was a long time ago.  That was, that was a year ago.  Yeah.  And the amazing part is the last time it was the, it, it was, it was in a very unfamiliar 
[03:49:00]  place.  That's how.  Well, Cleveland.  I mean, it's familiar to a lot of people.  They live there, but not to you, huh?  No.  Right.  That, that, that.  Here's the thing.  That was, that was over a year ago.  You've been gone from the Open Anthony show for over a year.  We finally let you back on as a bit of a goof and you have the opportunity to make a case  for yourself.  Not once did you mention to the people who make the decision, Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton,  that you want to be a part of this bus trip. 
[03:49:30]  I didn't want to bother them over it.  All right.  I just.  Well, what are you going to do?  Mention it on Twitter?  You know, they don't like it when you tweet them.  Well, I figured, I figured that.  Plus your account gets deleted most of the time.  I figured by what I did, they would, they would, they would probably get the idea.  And hey, I'd be excellent on the bus tour.  Why?  Because you'd be licking armpits?  No, that I could handle the, the wildness of the bus tour.  The rigors of the road?  Yup.  As a matter of fact, if I'm able to take Mr. Maloonigan's on the, on this trip, he'll 
[03:50:00]  be the official ONA bus tour party dog.  Yeah, we're not going to let your dog on the bus.  That's ridiculous.  Can we tie it to the back like National Lampoon Vacation?  Have you seen National Lampoon's Vacation?  No, that wouldn't be a good idea, all right?  Last thing I need is to deal, come home with the whole family crying.  Well, that's what happens when you come home anyway, Bobo.  No, that doesn't, that doesn't happen.  All right, Stan, corrected.  Let's go to Kevin in North Carolina.  What's up, buddy? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, I think everyone missed line of the day from Who Kid when he said, this is nigger  Twilight Zone.  And I want to see if Who Kid's going to be able to go back and do his own show now.  Who Kid, well, he'll be back.  I think he's doing something for Obie's Elevator show right now, but I saw him in the kitchen  and I was like, Who Kid, you got to come.  He was like, I'm here to do the after show.  I was like, you got to come do ONA for a little while.  There's chaos going on in the studio.  It is a different world.  Roland, you walked in to your office this morning.  What time did you get in?  About 7?  6.30? 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, before my coffee.  All right, you got in.  Yeah, you got in for your coffee because you get in early, especially on a day like today.  You don't even really need to be here until 8.30, 9 o'clock if you wanted to.  Yeah, with the release forms and all that shit.  So you want to make sure you get here early.  You sit down.  I don't even sit down.  I walk right in.  I step one foot in the office.  And what happened?  Yabby, yabby, yabby, yabby, yabby, yabby, yabby, yabby, yabby, yabby, yabby, yabby.  Oh, who are you?  What's going on?  What's this?  How are you?  Why are you sitting there? 
[03:51:30]  And you didn't like it.  I was like, in the morning, just leave me alone for five minutes.  And they weren't giving it to you?  No, then I said, shut up and sign this fucking paperwork.  He was.  He was just in the office.  Everybody was having a good time.  And Roland's in the chair going, shut up.  Shut up.  And then he looked at me and he said, Sam.  And he said it out loud so everybody could hear.  Fight a gun.  There would be a massacre in this building right now.  In my head, I was just going crazy.  I just need coffee.  Bobo, I mean, the breathing into the mic is like insanely loud.  What made you today during the show?  Your first time back on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:52:00]  Decide, I need to take a break from the action to go shit in the handicap stall.  What happened was I felt it so badly that I had to go.  Were you, as they say, turtling?  Well, it was this close to the I can't hold it any longer farts.  What did you eat that made you feel that way?  I don't know.  I don't know.  May have been the Shake Shack burger I ate last night.  Could have been.  Steve in Kentucky. 
[03:52:30]  How's it going, Steve?  All right.  Hey, Sam Pharrell, for once, I'm actually liking and listening to you.  Yeah.  Because I couldn't stand them two bitches.  They would not shut the fuck up.  They don't, do they?  I can't believe.  I can't believe I paid for a whole four hours of that bullshit.  Whether you're talking to them or you're not talking to them.  They just yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.  It's only quiet.  They just go after you.  Why do you just be quiet?  What was your favorite observation that was made by Lady Di or Marion today, Steve? 
[03:53:00]  She wouldn't shut the fuck up.  That was it.  You know, one of them.  You know, technically does.  I just didn't want to shut the fuck up.  That's the beauty of those two because normally, especially in this anti-bully culture that we live in right now, when you tell somebody that, yeah, there's this 51-year-old woman that we have on the show and we make fun of her because her ex-husband or whoever this guy was jumped in front of a train.  And it's hilarious.  Most people would say, go ahead. 
[03:53:30]  I wish they would both jump in front of a train.  Jesus Christ.  Exactly.  Most people would say, that's horrible.  You cannot make fun of somebody for that.  But then you listen to Lady Di and Marion for any amount of time.  It could be five minutes.  And you end up like Steve, who just wants the worst for both of them.  And you know that her husband's in a better place.  Exactly.  I'm sure I'll speak for everybody listening today.  You're fucking going batshit crazy, man.  Yep.  Thank you, Steve.  You know exactly what was going on in Lady Di's husband's head when he took that trip to the railroad station that morning. 
[03:54:00]  Probably the quietest day of his life.  Yeah.  Today will be my finest achievement.  Probably try to take a shit and she wouldn't shut up.  That's it.  I have no other choice.  Now, pucker up, choo-choo train.  I'm coming home.  Yeah, geez.  Keith in Illinois.  What's up, fam?  How's it going, buddy?  Nice, peaceful, quiet serenity.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  Just enjoy it that you and I can have a conversation without being interrupted by those two. 
[03:54:30]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Serenity now.  That's right, Bobo.  My ears are still bleeding.  So what's going on, Keith?  I was just going to tell Bobo, congratulations on the perfect show today.  You think Bobo had a perfect show?  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  Perfect.  Oh, well, Bobo, do you feel like today went perfectly for you?  Yeah, I think it went great.  Hmm.  I think it went so great I'm going to listen to today's show all over again.  Is that right?  Yeah, I have it.  I have my ex-m set to record. 
[03:55:00]  It's always set to record the show.  So, if you're going to go back, well, we replay all day.  Couldn't you just listen to a replay?  It, well, this way I could listen to it on my time.  I don't have to wait for the replay to start at a certain time.  You're right.  And as you said earlier today, it's Bobo time, right?  Exactly.  Was that your favorite moment when you told Lady Di and Marion to shut up because it's Bobo time?  Yep.  You like that the best.  Yep, exactly.  What was better, telling them to shut up because it's Bobo time or leaving the show to take that nice hot deuce? 
[03:55:30]  I think it was saying it's Bobo time.  Good.  Good, Bobo.  Yeah, did you write the elephant thing?  That little pyramid elephant, E-Rock Roland?  Oh, did you take, I wrote things that are overweight was the clue.  Oh, all right.  And you didn't like that the intern brought your name up, huh?  No, I'm sure she read it.  I mean, you could check the clues.  We could bring the intern in.  She didn't read it, Roland.  Yeah, E-Rock was in the room.  All Sam was holding up was what the clue was, and she came up with the list. 
[03:56:00]  She did.  What?  Do you want to hear the Bobo thing, by the way?  I pulled it.  Which Bobo thing?  The shut up, cunts, it's Bobo time.  That's right.  How could I forget that C word?  Is that your new favorite drop?  I came back from break with it.  Let me hear it.  Shut up, cunts, it's Bobo time.  Is that your new ringtone, buddy?  That's got to be a ringtone.  Where's Jackie?  She's gone.  What do you mean she's gone?  She had to leave.  She had to leave?  Yeah.  What? 
[03:56:30]  She gets her, this is the interns we have now, they get their airtime and then they're  done for the day?  She asked permission if she could leave because she's heading back home.  And who's going to say no to her, right?  Well, I wasn't the one she asked permission from.  Who'd she ask permission from?  I think people who sit in that room, somebody.  Who?  And she's like, it's okay, I can leave Friday.  I said, okay, fine.  Who do you, I don't understand, what did Sal give her permission?  I don't know, she just came in and she told me, she's like, oh, my bus is early, I have  to leave at 10.30 on Friday.  I said, okay.  That's amazing. 
[03:57:00]  And she made it seem like she already got permission.  That's amazing.  All right, whatever.  Can you imagine that, going through your internship with those kind of perks?  Poor Sidney's in there trying to be a good intern, even though she doesn't have to be.  I'm not going through your paid position with those perks.  What do you mean?  We don't get those perks and we're paid to be here.  True.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you imagine getting to do that in our position, let alone as an intern?  Trucker Bob.  Well, you know, boys, I can so understand poor Roland.  Them bitches just wouldn't shut up.  They were mind-numbing.  I was contemplating self-mutilation and then they finally shut up and left. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, can you imagine?  Can you imagine having a tight little office?  And that's what you come to in the morning?  Oh, no, I can't.  Holy shit.  Point.  Thanks, Bob.  Here, boys.  Would you say Lady Di and Mary and Roland were your least favorite guests?  I mean, they're fine here.  I mean, but just like when I sit down, just like shut up.  Because you've not been able to shake it.  You've been in a bad mood ever since you walked in. 
[03:58:00]  It's been a shit week.  So I was like, all right, I just go in, pop through the day, and I'm out.  And then when you wake up and hear people are just yapping, asking you 50 questions.  And they're none of them good questions.  And none of them are A-list talents.  I was like, I don't give a shit.  They're not talented people.  They don't ask good questions.  No.  They're all, I mean, there's a reason why Opie and Anthony called them the retarded Laverna.  And they asked, do you know why this happened?  Bobo.  I know.  Bobo, what's that bag that E-Rock has there?  What the heck?  Anthony bought these cookies and left them there? 
[03:58:30]  Now, Bobo came in with some Girl Scout cookies that I guess Anthony had purchased.  Is it true he purchased them years ago?  No, he purchased them this year.  2013?  I don't think so.  Yeah, he purchased them 2013.  It's just that we didn't have a chance to get them to him.  She did a giveaway?  Are you helping yourself to him right now, Eric?  No, I was just seeing how many there were.  There's a lot in here.  Well, Anthony bought a lot.  He's a nice guy.  He bought a lot from, he bought a lot of cookies from me.  Joker wants to say hi.  There's 15 boxes of cookies and Anthony just left them behind. 
[03:59:00]  Ah, to live the rich life.  What's up, Joker?  Hey, Sam.  Congratulations on the massive improvement you've made over the years.  It's awesome listening to the after show, especially after a show like today.  Yeah.  But, hey, I do have a question for you.  Over the last year, I've won a couple different things, you know, listen to your show.  And one of them was a signed book, Nicky Six, that your buddy there had and brought in all his shit that he was trying to not have to move. 
[03:59:30]  Troy.  And then, yeah, recently, Roland came in and had a DVD that he said I could have and was going to send to me.  Nothing makes it to my house.  I mean, what?  So you didn't get your third prize?  I don't understand.  I mean.  No.  No.  One prize would be nice.  But, you know, I figured it was a show full of bitches.  I might as well get my bitch in today, too.  I understand.  I guess what the intern didn't send a DVD out?  I gave them everything and before. 
[04:00:00]  Right.  All right.  You want a mixtape?  I don't know what happens, man.  I'd love a mixtape.  All right.  Hold on.  Get Joker's information.  You can have a mixtape.  This guy.  This guy.  You see what happens, Roland?  You give and give and give.  More and more.  More and more.  More and more.  It must have been something with the mail delivery guy's fault that the stuff got lost.  Right.  Why isn't he calling the postal service?  Finally, Bobo, make it some sense.  Yeah.  I've heard how people sometimes see the address and where the mail is from and they usually  have a good idea of what's in the box.  They say, oh, this is from so-and-so. 
[04:00:30]  This is some good stuff.  I'm stealing that.  You think that happens?  Yeah.  Corrupt stuff happens all the time in government-run businesses.  What do you think is the most corrupt government-run business?  The MTA.  You think so?  More money.  Yeah.  Nothing gets really improved.  How much are you paying for a subway ride?  A subway ride now costs...  $250, I think.  $250.  How much?  $5 for a round trip.  And how much did that cost a couple years ago?  That cost about $125. 
[04:01:00]  And what do you get?  Is $125 each way?  That's $250 for a round trip, doubling the price.  Bobo, how has your ride improved?  Nothing.  Same thing.  What?  Same thing.  Same underfunded thing.  Still takes an eternity to wait for a bus.  Mm-hmm.  They still don't under-maintained.  Under-maintaining the system all of a sudden is catching up with the MTA.  So you're thinking there's corruption here? 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, they are.  How do you mess up the most used business in the world?  What do you think the corruption is, specifically?  I think they're not using the money for what it's supposed to be doing.  Where do you think the money's going?  I'm thinking it could be going to...  I might be far-fetched, but this is not far from the truth.  Okay.  Well, if you can...  As long as you're not being far from the truth, it's okay to be far-fetched.  I might be exaggerating, but...  But not far from the truth.  Yeah.  It wouldn't surprise me if I found out they were using it for limousines. 
[04:02:00]  Expensive booze.  So you're saying that these politicians are actually...  Go ahead.  And steak.  And most importantly...  Right.  Prostitutes.  No!  Not the MTA money.  I'm telling you, that's how corrupt they are.  It would not surprise me a bit.  So you're telling me that these guys who work for the MTA are nothing more than limousine  riding, jet plane flying, wheeling, dealing, kiss-stealing, son-of-a-guns?  Woo!  Exactly. 
[04:02:30]  My God, Bobo.  Bobo, who kid, was just...  Oh, good.  Lady Di and Marion are back.  Yo, we just twerked an elevator.  All right.  Sorry.  Feel free.  No, no, no.  You're not cutting me off at all.  No, we were actually just taking some calls from the listeners who were so relieved that  Lady Di and Marion were gone.  Now they're back.  It's ironic that they're back.  Bobo was exposing some truths about government conspiracies and corruption.  Nah, son.  What, like some Illuminati stuff?  Yeah.  He thinks the MTA is very corrupt. 
[04:03:00]  He thinks that these subway tolls...  Ladies, do you use the MTA?  Do I use the MTA?  I used to.  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah.  What happened?  Why'd you stop?  Well, I stopped because I...  Lack of funds?  Back then, I lost my job.  Yeah.  Right.  There's nowhere to go.  Yeah.  It's not like there's a bus that takes you from your bedroom to the couch to watch TV,  right?  No, no.  So what do you need it for?  Am I right?  Right.  Right.  Exactly right.  Plus, I don't live in New York.  I live in New Jersey.  Okay.  That path train, kid.  That's a good reason, right?  Yeah, but she very rarely needs to come to the city because, like I said, her couch is just 
[04:03:30]  a few footsteps away.  Did you know the lady died...  She doesn't work.  She hasn't worked for how many years?  I haven't worked already about maybe four years.  Four years.  How did it feel?  She doesn't do shit.  She stays at home.  She watches the monkeys.  That's hot.  She watches the Partridge family.  That's hot.  And, you know...  Remember I told you that, right?  I remember that.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Damn.  And does nothing.  And a bunch of game shows, too.  And game shows. 
[04:04:00]  She watches reruns of Pressure Luck.  No.  Not that one.  But how does it feel...  Match game.  Of course.  I was wrong, and I stand corrected.  How does it feel when people like Stalker Patty and Marion are sitting here and saying,  there is no reason that someone should be unemployed for four years?  Even Stalker Patty has had two jobs since you've ever had a job.  I was unemployed for four years, but I didn't do like two out of those four years.  I mean, I feel like your ex, who, if we remember, jumped in front of a train...  Oh, shit, for real? 
[04:04:30]  Has a better...  Has a...  No, we won't bring him up again.  But I feel like he, at this point, is more likely to get a job than you.  That...  Is that true or false?  And I could be wrong.  That's false.  That's false.  Okay, well, I stand corrected then.  I will get a job.  It's just going to take a little time.  You've got to fill out applications and so on.  Right.  And some of those can be upwards of a page and a half.  Well, some of them take an hour to fill out.  And the thing is about job applications is that you'll sit there and say...  It's on the computer.  Yeah, I guess it's on.  She's got that nigga mentality. 
[04:05:00]  I like that.  We just don't have the headphones.  She is.  She's like a black person.  Well, because she's sitting there going, it could take upwards of an hour to fill out  a job application.  I just don't have the time.  I don't have the time.  And then you fill out these...  Everything's on computer now.  Right.  So some people don't want to sit there within a half hour to fill out on computer.  And you fill out these job applications, and all of a sudden, there's another side  of this page.  I got to fill out the back, too.  You know what I mean?  I mean, I have a job.  You got a job.  I got a job for 19 years.  See?  I'm so happy I'm hearing this from white people.  We're not all crazy. 
[04:05:30]  Well, I had my job for 17 years.  I didn't feel to get felt up by Who Kid today.  What?  Did you like that?  To get felt up by DJ Who Kid.  Yes, I am.  You got felt up by DJ Who Kid.  Was that titillating?  She said it was nice.  It was very nice.  Yeah?  Did you feel any discharge?  No.  So just one discharge today?  Yeah, just one.  Just the one.  I thought it was Bobo.  If you might say, all right, yeah.  Just the one discharge.  Right.  I tried to make out with him in the elevator.  How did that go?  I didn't want anything to do with it.  He wanted us to go upside down in the elevator.  I don't do upside down.  Sorry.  Why wouldn't you make out with Troy? 
[04:06:00]  Mary doesn't go upside down.  He's a handsome guy.  We try to get him to twerk upside down.  Sure, like the video.  Like the high school girls do.  Mary don't do cartwheels.  I don't do splits.  Right.  I didn't want to get them to make out, but they wouldn't make out.  I don't do the lesbo either or anything like that.  The lesbo?  No.  I don't do that thing.  I'm married.  You guys are best friends.  So what?  What does that mean?  So you make out a little bit.  Who kid to me have kissed on occasion?  Who's your best friend?  DJ Who Kid is?  I really don't remember that.  You wouldn't, would you?  You'd never take a drink from me in a bar, Who Kid.  Always check to see where it comes from.  Someone must have been drinking two bottles of Jack that day. 
[04:06:30]  Bobo!  Jack Daniels.  Nailed it again.  Well.  Well, you must drink Jack Daniels.  We talk about Jack a lot.  Who would you say was the MVP of today's show?  It is my heart.  Bobo, I got to get to Marion.  Who would you say was the MVP of today's show?  Me.  You would say you.  Bobo, who would you say is the MVP of today's show?  Me and Colin Quinn.  Okay.  Bobo?  And I'll be Anthony.  Okay, you just named five people.  Bobo.  Well, I'd have to say it was kind of co-MVPs between these two. 
[04:07:00]  Lady Di and Marion?  And myself.  Okay, you named three people.  Okay, and Lady Di?  Colin Quinn.  Colin Quinn.  A respectable answer from a not terribly respectable person.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Well, listen.  It was good to see him again.  The show's ending.  Sydney, our lovely intern, has something going on this weekend.  Is that right, Sydney?  I do.  What's happening?  On Sunday on Faction, which is channel 41, I'm doing the do-it-yourself radio.  Sunday?  Yes, at 8. 
[04:07:30]  8 p.m.?  8 p.m.  8 p.m.  Eastern time.  Tune into Faction, where Sydney will be doing do-it-yourself radio.  I pitched myself.  After I heard Sydney was doing it, I asked the guys if I could do a do-it-yourself radio  on Faction, and they said that that would defeat the purpose because I'm already on the  radio.  I would just be...  Were they playing with themselves?  No, do-it-yourself radio is like an intern.  I talk about it.  Right.  She's not experienced.  She's just jumping on.  I'm playing with a pussy.  Well, congratulations, Sydney.  Okay.  You won't be playing with yourself on the radio?  Do-it-yourself. 
[04:08:00]  No.  I'll refrain.  I'll leave that to...  Lady Di and Marion.  Yes.  All right.  Well, Marion is married, so she won't be doing that.  Lady Di, she's got nothing going on anyway.  What am I supposed to do again?  Listen, you'll be playing with yourself on Faction at some point, but listen to Sydney  Sunday at 8 p.m.  Eastern.  Who Kid, thank you for stopping by.  Can I shout out my thing this morning?  Shout it out.  8 p.m.?  50 Cent's birthday party show is tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  On Sirius XM, and of course, I'm with all the black people at BET Awards in LA.  Now you got something to do on Saturday and Sunday.  My show's on Sunday, 4 p.m. 
[04:08:30]  Eastern.  Are we going to the Met game tomorrow?  Oh, shit.  Nobody cares where you're going tomorrow.  Marion, that's the problem.  Anybody that's a fan of ONA could come to the parties at Supper Club with me.  Supper Club.  Me and Jamie Foxx.  Tweet him at DJ Who Kid.  He's got all the information there.  Jamie Foxx, what up?  Bobo, Lady Di, Marion.  My nigga.  It's been exhausting.  We'll see you next time.  Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the ONA show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.
