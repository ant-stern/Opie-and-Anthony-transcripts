<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in sexually explicit and offensive jokes about their own show, followed by cryptic praise for Howard Stern, promising a later explanation.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to promoting a poker tournament at Foxwoods Casino, punctuated by updates on Mike from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, documenting his eventful road trip to the event.  This segment transitioned into a discussion of a viral video featuring a parrot singing “Let the Bodies Hit the Floor,” which segued into conversations about the parrot's vocal abilities, the song's history, and the deaths of its original singer and another musician.

The hosts then launched into a highly offensive critique of Larry King's final broadcast of *Larry King Live*,  targeting King, Bill Maher, and others with insulting remarks and analyzing clips from the show, including a bizarre moment where Bill Clinton seemingly hijacked a press conference intended for President Obama.  Their commentary on this event involved highly offensive language and stereotypes.  Further offensive comments about Larry King, including his interview with Sharon Tate's sister, concluded this segment.  A planned interview with a Secret Service agent was briefly mentioned. Opie briefly shared an anecdote about his child's meeting with Santa Claus.

The next segment delved into anxieties surrounding children meeting Santa,  the "creepiness" of mall Santas (including a caller revealing a former mall Santa's later incarceration for child-related offenses), and a *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* Christmas episode featuring a Santa-mother-son storyline. The hosts discussed the show's lack of political correctness and FX's creative freedom.  Additional topics included a Macy's Santa fired for a risqué joke, the high cost of Knicks-Lakers tickets, a listener's experience working at a juvenile sexual offender group home, slang terms for money, marijuana consumption methods (joints and vaporizers), and a hockey game featuring a stuffed animal toss.  A video of Kevin Hart at a party where a woman's hair caught fire was described in detail.  The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion of Sam's experience at the *Little Fockers* premiere, including celebrity interactions, a movie critique, and suggestions for Sirius XM's branding.  Uncle Paul participated throughout this segment.

The *Little Fockers* theme continued, focusing on the common failure of comedy sequels and the film's potential to defy that trend.  An in-studio interview with Daisy, a young actress from *Little Fockers*, took a sexually suggestive turn, prompting concern from a show representative.  The conversation then veered to the hosts' red carpet experiences, their strained relationships with publicists, and a humorous anecdote about using stand-ins. Further discussions included interactions with Kevin Hart and Blythe Danner (whose name was repeatedly mispronounced),  a mockery of a Harlem gun buyback program, and a crude speculation about the sexuality of various US presidents. This segment also featured a phone interview with Gerald Blaine, a former Secret Service agent who protected Presidents Kennedy, Eisenhower, and Johnson.  Blaine discussed his book, *The Kennedy Detail*, and his firsthand account of the Kennedy assassination, refuting conspiracy theories.

Finally, a phone interview with former Secret Service agent General Blaine provided a detailed account of the Kennedy assassination, debunking conspiracy theories and explaining the logistical impossibilities of certain proposed scenarios.  Blaine discussed the Secret Service's operational methods in the 1960s, the emotional toll of the assassination on the agents, and the enduring public fascination with the event, including the impact of Oliver Stone's *JFK*. He also shared anecdotes about protecting Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, touching on their personalities and interactions with agents, and discussed Jack Ruby's actions. The interview concluded with promotion of upcoming Opie and Anthony events, including the Foxwoods poker game.  Strong language, including curse words, was used throughout the broadcast.

[00:11:30]  put it out on wiki leaks all right so the poker tournament is happening we got uh mike from  baton rouge on his way which is very good news oh the parrot's singing uh let the bodies hit the  floor it's good so many fucking people it's so crazy man i didn't get it it's a strange thing  what is it right i was out of touch yesterday i had way too much shit going on but oh yeah i gotta  literally i gotta go to awake from really good friend who died my brother's my brother's best 
[00:12:00]  friend gavin oh so you know obviously we all know i remember him he was a fucking cool guy i used to  hang out with him down uh fh riley's drink some beers you probably met him because he was uh yeah he  cooked us the food at uh jones beach when we're doing the comedy show he was like the the short kind  of kind of redheaded guy pudgy redheaded guy just the greatest guy in the sky and he's gone at 41  i gotta go wow i gotta go to awake mad balls he was basically part of our family i've known him  since i was five what do you have cancer ah that's uh he was a diabetic so i don't i don't really have 
[00:12:30]  all the details fucking diabetes but uh watch that shit it's so depressing that people in your own age  group start dying of stuff and you know you have to start thinking like why that person was really  young yeah it stinks just horrible i don't want to bring everyone down but that's what i i gotta go do  that today and i was dealing with some other shit uh yesterday uh the parrot though can we play this  really fast danny we can supposedly the parrot doing uh when the bodies hit the floor let the bodies  hit the floor a parrot i almost bailed on it because at first i was like but then i listened to the 
[00:13:00]  whole clip and i was like that's kind of really creepy parrots are very weird when they talk it's just  the oddest thing to look at a bird saying human words and it's it is just creepy right because  they just they they obviously don't have like mouths and lips so they can't uh you know uh articulate  like a human they just open their beak a little and words spill out in in weird like muffly but 
[00:13:30]  there's a fashion they just have they just mimic though they mimic sounds like they can mimic like  in the wild i think it's other birds they can mimic other birds but they have no idea what  they're saying obviously no but it's still creepy when human words come out of a fucking parrot but  they seem to know like when to say certain words based on your uh keywords right like they'll be  like what does you go what does the dog say and he'll go so he knows like what you're asking him  to do which parrot is it the gray parrot i think in the video or i think it's what parrot talks the 
[00:14:00]  the best i think they all do i think there's some other types of birds besides parrots that can talk  to minor birds yeah and even parakeets have been known but it's very hard very rare quakers can be  taught to say stuff too really i think so i like minor birds because they look cool they're black and  they got that orange on the side of their head and they talk i remember one at uh at uh uh bar in  california when i used to live out there and it was a golf course bar and he just used to say golf  things oh that's except for like pretty bird he'd be like take a mulligan take a mulligan 
[00:14:30]  birdie birdie and he would just get up what sick fuck whipped the bird until it spoke properly for  the people at the golf course i know the golf course what kind of torture did they put the  bird through it was great for everyone else's enjoyment well here we go here's the cockatoos  they talk also like fred from beretta here's the parrot uh a lot of people talking about this today  what 
[00:15:00]  what  what  what  what  Oh, fuck, I gotta tweet that shit. 
[00:15:30]  I didn't realize it was that good.  It's just classic.  Danny sent that to me.  I gotta tweet that fucking thing.  Yeah, but he's off key.  That bird rocks.  I don't like that bird.  He sounded like a child.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Now I gotta be the guy.  I'm looking at the video.  Is it possible that someone's doing that off camera?  It's possible, but it sounds like a fucking bird.  It does.  And it's possible.  I mean, it's more...  I guess it would be easier if someone faked it, but it's not impossible.  I've seen fucking...  And for the people that don't know, you got the song, E-Rock. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, fuck.  Who doesn't know that song?  Are you serious?  One minute?  One minute?  Why?  Why wouldn't you have that queued up?  Oh, poor E-Rock.  Here.  E-Rock looks like the confused guy in, like, a space capsule.  Oh, this is a gym.  I can't say that.  Because I'm a fatso, too, E-Rock.  We should go to camp together.  This is the song the parrot's doing.  He did it pretty well. 
[00:17:00]  He did.  Or he can sing.  Yeah.  Do you think they just put the singing part on a loop for him when he was sleeping?  Supposed to be sleeping?  Either that or this guy really likes Drowning Pool.  Yeah.  Okay.  This song rocked when it was out, right?  Oh, fucking yeah.  Remember, they wouldn't...  Yeah, they wouldn't play it after 9-11.  After 9-11, there was a no play.  Like, they suggested you didn't play certain songs. 
[00:17:30]  And then the singer's dead.  Yeah, but the band just moved on.  They got a new guy and moved on.  They got a guy that sings like this?  Yeah, we talked to him.  They got that parrot, right?  That's a fucking bird.  We talked to the lead singer of Drowning Pool before he died.  He was a great guy.  Really nice guy.  I forgot his name, unfortunately.  Parrot owner has info on them.  All right, let's go to Jeff in Colorado.  Jeff!  Yeah, I haven't seen that video, but I'm assuming that's an African gray. 
[00:18:00]  It looked like it, sure.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, they're supposed to be the best talkers of all the parrots.  Really?  Yes.  And they also have brain capacities of a three- to five-year-old child.  Oh, yeah?  So they do more than mimic.  They can actually be taught to be potty trained.  How do you potty train a bird?  Dude, get one of these for the compound.  I think we need one.  I'm having a good time.  When your bird is shitting in front of you, you can use a keyword like, oh, going potty 
[00:18:30]  or taking a shit.  You say it over and over and over and over, and eventually you can actually bring them  to an area that you want them to shit in.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but if they're that smart, why wouldn't you teach them something cool instead of where  to shit?  And believe me, Opie, this would be the worst thing at the compound.  Of course.  Because would you imagine what this bird would be saying? 
[00:19:00]  Of course.  This bird would be fired.  Worse than Imus, that bird.  Just blurting out racial epithets.  That should be fantastic.  I'd bring him in the truck with me so he could yell at cabbies.  Yeah, it would be a good thing to have.  My racist African gray.  Oh, so YouTube does have these.  Oh, no. 
[00:19:30]  Guy doesn't know how to edit a 10-minute video.  Jesus.  I wouldn't sit through 10 minutes of anything.  What'd he say?  I'm sorry.  I think he said fucking asshole.  Wait, hang on.  I'm going to go back.  You know what?  Could someone listen?  Fucking asshole.  Someone should listen to the 10-minute fucking piece.  Yeah, and just cut out the good stuff.  Yeah, get some good stuff.  Get all the good shit from my racist African gray. 
[00:20:00]  We're obsessed with the African gray, so if someone could look at other videos and give  us the best African grays on the internet today.  That was a good one.  In honor of the parrots singing that, let the bodies hit the floor.  Yeah.  So it's over for Larry King, and no one watched.  Did you watch?  No.  And believe me, I am a fan of his work.  You know, at the end of his run, we had more listeners than he had viewers.  Yeah.  That's pretty sad.  It's pretty sad.  They had like a dramatic ending also. 
[00:20:30]  I saw the clip.  I didn't see that.  They had a dramatic ending.  With a hearse.  Good morning, everyone.  Hi, man.  When he said goodbye, finally, or whatever he said, I guess we got it on tape.  I'm not going to ruin the big reveal.  But they just dimmed the light and had one single light on his microphone on the desk.  Without him there?  Well, he was there, but he was in the dark.  Like, they dimmed all of his lights.  And kept the mic lit.  And they just lit the mic up.  And that was that. 
[00:21:00]  Why couldn't they have, like, Piers just kind of, you know, push him out of his seat?  Yeah.  Making it to a comedy routine.  Why does it always have to be dramatic?  It had to be the big dramatic thing.  Fucking Larry King was pushed out.  Everyone knows.  So at the end, they should have had Piers just, like, you know, push his roly-poly fucking chair.  And there goes Larry in his suspenders.  And he sits down and goes, I'll see you guys in January.  Yeah.  And then just pull the fucking light, bright things out of his board behind him.  Right.  Spell good riddance, you old fuck.  Well, Larry said it's not a goodbye. 
[00:21:30]  It's not.  It is a goodbye.  He's 77.  He'll be dead by 80.  That's how this works.  Oh, boy.  That's how it works.  Once they retire.  When these guys, you know.  When they have nothing to get up for in the morning.  Yeah.  When they retire like this, they end up dying within a year.  Sometimes within the year.  But I'll give Larry till 80.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he'll be, that's what's going to happen to Larry.  Suspenders.  And stupid Ryan Seacrest.  That goddamn guy is everywhere.  Oh, he's terrific.  All right.  Here's Larry King's last show. 
[00:22:00]  Starts the show by introing the guests.  And welcome to the last Larry King lot.  It's hard to say that.  I knew this day was coming.  These words are not easy to say.  Bill Maher is the host of Real Time with Bill Maher on HBO.  That's Larry King.  Right, go, right to it.  Bill Maher.  Ryan Seacrest is a radio and TV host and producer.  They'll be with us throughout the show.  There's a Larry King live send-off party.  It's going on right now in Beverly Hills.  We'll be checking in there during the hour. 
[00:22:30]  And we'll be heading there as soon as the show is over.  Thank you both for coming.  I'm very grateful.  It's at a funeral.  I mean it.  I'm very grateful, Bill.  Larry, you're 25 years.  You're an icon.  Everyone's waiting for your words.  And your words are, these are hard words to say.  Bill Maher.  Shut the fuck up, Bill Maher.  I'm sorry.  I can't stand that fuck.  You don't like the Bill Maher.  I can't stand Bill Maher with his fucking Great Wall of China head. 
[00:23:00]  Fuck him, you pompous liberal cunt.  God, I hate him.  You think he's a little pompous?  He's so pompous.  He's so self-important.  Is there someone that's more pompous than he is?  God, no.  No.  I submit to you no.  With his fucking Art Garfunkel hairdo, he's getting there.  Wonderful.  Fuck him.  He's so fucking irreverent. 
[00:23:30]  Ooh.  Does his show and really sticks it to the man.  Man.  Get out of here.  Go fuck off.  Yeah, that's my feeling of Bill Maher.  Regis tries to sing a song with Larry.  Larry doesn't know the words.  Well, that's great, Larry.  Regis.  I'm going for you tonight, Larry, okay?  Totally unrehearsed.  All right.  So long for a while.  That's all the king for a while.  Yours. 
[00:24:00]  Larry, don't let me down now.  Goodbye to your hit parade.  No, you've got a song.  Yeah, Frank Sinatra's that.  Yeah.  So long to your hit parade.  And the guests that you love to be played, Larry doesn't remember it.  We're dying, Trump.  I don't know the hit parade song.  We're dying here.  Okay, you got me, Regis.  I lose.  I didn't need to get you.  I just wanted to show everybody that you know all those songs.  You've got to leave on top.  Not quite Bette Midler on Carson.  Yeah, that's what Regis was going for that. 
[00:24:30]  Regis was going for a moment.  Yeah.  Regis said, we're dying here.  We're dying here.  Let's go.  Come on.  Take it, Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  How about this one, Larry?  Let the bodies hit the floor.  Let the bodies hit the floor.  Let the bodies hit the floor, Larry.  I'm a bird.  You've got to leave on top. 
[00:25:00]  On top.  This guy should have left probably three years ago, I would guess.  I would say longer than that.  Even longer than that?  Five years ago.  He should have just left.  He should have fucking cashed it in.  It would have been a much bigger thing.  Everyone.  There wasn't one person left that didn't know this guy was done.  Done.  His interviews got to the point of being sad.  He used to do 1.5 million, I believe, viewers.  Yeah.  And he was down to 450,000. 
[00:25:30]  I would think the viewership would go up as he got more crazy because it was just more  entertaining.  That's what I was thinking.  Of course.  When he fucking, my favorite one of all time, when he accused.  Did it make the Larry King top moments?  When he accused Roman Polanski of the Tate murder.  That is the best fucking clip ever.  He what?  Oh my God.  It's fantastic.  I don't know that one.  When he was talking to Sharon Tate's sister.  What we got, and we can play right after.  I want to hear it. 
[00:26:00]  Well, we got the Larry King in 2010.  These are the top moments of only the past year in front of me.  Only the past year.  Yes.  Top moments.  Larry King.  But first, his last show last night.  Then he got to talk it to Bill Clinton.  You look well fit.  Are you feeling well?  I feel great.  I've been traveling quite a bit.  But as you pointed out, I just got back from Haiti and from the day before in the Dominican Republic.  But I'm encouraged by some of what I saw there.  And I'm kind of like you. 
[00:26:30]  I have to keep working.  Oops.  I don't know if it keeps me young, but at least it keeps me out of the grave.  So I feel good about it.  And I'm pretty much sad.  Well, we just said Bill Clinton knows.  As soon as you stop working, usually you die soon after that.  You got to do something.  And that's why Bill Clinton's fucking winging around the world.  Right.  Doing press conferences for Obama.  Right.  Which was hysterical, by the way.  It's embarrassing.  I love how Obama just left the podium.  My wife is expecting me and I must leave. 
[00:27:00]  Hi, I'm president again.  Hey, ask the question.  And the press is like, Mr. President.  Yeah.  Yes, they are.  They address him as Mr. President.  I didn't see this.  So he's at the podium being addressed by the press as Mr. President talking about the economy.  And Obama just hightailed it out of here.  Whoa.  He left because his wife was expecting him.  Excuse me.  We're in a fucking economic downfall here.  And he did.  And I, you know something.  When was this, by the way?  A couple weeks ago?  A couple weeks ago.  Not even. 
[00:27:30]  Maybe a week ago.  It was embarrassing for the president.  I felt, I felt better, not as a racist, but just as an American, I felt better seeing  Clinton up there taking questions from the press about the economy than I ever would  Obama.  Because Clinton's, at least you look at like the old, he's been there, it was eight years  of presidency, he's had time to reflect.  I'm going to hear this.  Bad audio, bud.  Here's what I'll say is I've been keeping the first lady waiting for about half an hour.  So I'm going to take off. 
[00:28:00]  I don't want to make her mad.  Please go.  You're in good hands.  And Hibs will call last question.  Look at this, he leaves.  Thank you.  And now watch.  Yeah, go ahead.  Mr. President.  All of a sudden, I thought I was back in the fucking 90s.  And look, he leans over.  Oh, he's still Clinton president.  Right.  He just became president again.  He looks so presidential.  Mr. President.  That's great.  What's the next step? 
[00:28:30]  Well, first of all, let me just run through the numbers again.  Oh, my God.  Fucking Obama abandoned the podium and put Clinton there.  Why wasn't this everywhere?  I didn't.  The second I saw this, I thought it was gold.  And why aren't people goofing on it?  It's great.  Because the liberal fucking media would not push this to the point where you see Obama abandoning his post.  He abandoned his post.  Why can't they just have fun with this shit? 
[00:29:00]  Because his wife wanted him?  Sorry, the country's a little more important.  He's the fucking president.  Honestly, I don't even give a shit that Obama left.  I think it's hilarious that he left.  And then all of a sudden they say, Mr. President.  Mr. President.  Looking like he's the president.  Let's go over some of the numbers.  How old is Clinton now?  Someone had a goof on that.  How old is he?  Wow.  I have no idea.  Could he run again?  He won't.  But could he?  I don't think he could.  I think two terms is it.  Oh, you're not allowed to run again?  I don't even think you could skip a term and then...  Why?  Bloomberg did it. 
[00:29:30]  Make up your own rules.  State law is a little different.  Yeah.  Make up your own rules.  I don't think he would want the job.  I bet you there's a way he could do it.  Maybe.  How about his vice president?  Can he be vice president and then the president unfortunately dies and then they move him up?  I don't think he could do that either.  He can't even be vice president?  I don't think so.  What about secretary of state?  What about the speaker of the house?  Well, he could probably do things like that, but maybe if you're in succession for the  president, you can't. 
[00:30:00]  What are you...  Iraq knows?  Does Iraq know this?  No, you said it.  You can't be in the line of succession to be the president if you've already served both  terms.  Yeah, but we're all in the line of...  We all are.  Yes.  Are we really?  If enough shit happens, yes.  Are you campaigning on the Sex for Sam platform or the Mayor's Dead platform?  To get to our level, it's got to be some kind of Armageddon.  Yeah, of course.  Anarchy.  You're 64.  I'm here.  Okay.  64?  Here's Larry talking to Bill Clinton last night on his last show.  And I'm really glad to see you here and still up and going. 
[00:30:30]  We're both in the zipper club.  By the way, you looked very good last week in the briefing room.  What is the zipper club?  What is the zipper club?  Is that like a body bag joke?  The zipper club.  Wow, is it?  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  What is the zipper club?  Is that the coroner's fucking...  Oh, oh, open heart surgery.  Oh, sure.  Okay.  Oh, that's right.  He's got the big zipper on the chest or something.  Very good.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We're both in the zipper club. 
[00:31:00]  That's the open heart surgery.  Jeez.  Larry's zipper's going to be unzipped a little sooner than Bill's, I think.  We're both in the zipper club.  By the way, you looked very good last week in the briefing room at the White House doing  that little 30-minute session.  Did that make you yearn to return?  No.  No.  It was actually funny.  Oh, that's cool.  I would love to hear his answer there.  It was quite what?  Because he's talking about that impromptu.  Okay.  I wonder why Obama... 
[00:31:30]  Was it proper for Obama to leave?  Was he just kind of giving Clinton a chance to answer questions?  I don't know.  I think he feels people are more comfortable.  I don't know.  I just stood in for the...  For a while.  Just for a few minutes.  It was fun.  In person.  I really think Obama and his people...  I think that was well organized and choreographed, that whole thing.  I think it made people...  Because I looked at it like, oh, oh, good.  Let me listen to Bill Clinton. 
[00:32:00]  And all he was doing is pretty much giving Obama's line on this whole tax situation and  a few other issues.  But it was more like, I was more willing to listen with an open mind with Bill Clinton  saying it than Obama.  And again, not because of race, but just because Obama's credibility is so in the shitter right  now that I was more willing to accept what Bill Clinton was saying than Obama.  And I think a lot of people in the White House and around the President knew that. 
[00:32:30]  You think it was calculated?  Very calculated.  I think it was just one of those moments that just happened.  Nothing just happens with Obama.  Nothing.  Everything is very, very choreographed.  Well, when Obama left, Clinton should have said, could you excuse me for a second?  And then, you know, get some blackface on.  Oh, Jesus.  Could you see if he came out in vaudevillian blackface to an old fucking 20s song?  If I'm going to do this, might as well do it right.  Your questions!  Your questions! 
[00:33:00]  Mammy!  Mammy!  How I love you!  How I love you!  My sweet old mammy!  Let's take a question from CNN!  Why not?  Well, what in taxes?  They're going to be high for everyone if we don't sign a bill.  We're going to sign a bill.  Let me do a little sign-a-bill soft shoe for you.  Whack-a-duck-a-doo!  Whack-a-duck-a-doo!  Whack-a-duck-a-doo!  And Clinton's just doing his fucking blackface.  There's nothing to lose.  Oh, they love him. 
[00:33:30]  Why does he have to always play it so straight?  I don't know.  You're saying playing it straight is not getting in blackface?  Yes!  I think there's a lot of room there.  There's a lot of room there.  Yeah, but Clinton's got to be bored by now.  Why not?  Why not throw it all out there?  Mr. President, pull up your pants.  Thank you, Doug DeTrump.  Yes, pull up your pants.  They do have Clinton in blackface.  Somebody photoshopped it.  Oh, really?  It's photoshopped?  You don't think Clinton has any skin in the game, as they say.  You feel trusting him more. 
[00:34:00]  Yes.  Because you feel like, well, he really is not a politician at this moment, so...  Right.  It was very calculated.  He got Obama's agenda across in a way where people that don't like Obama at this point were willing to listen.  Absolutely.  All right.  I think it was a very calculated move.  Not even a dumb move.  It's pretty smart.  Get him out of there.  Do you honestly think the President of the United States, during this economic crisis,  talking about the taxes, which is like the number one fucking thing with the House and the Senate, 
[00:34:30]  is going to leave because he told his wife that he was going to be somewhere?  Do you honestly fucking think the President's doing that?  I completely say yes.  Really?  Because it's Michelle Obama.  Really?  She's a tough broad.  She's one of those broads.  She wears the pants.  She's one of those broads.  She wears the pants.  I don't care what you do for a living.  I bet.  I bet your head goes back and forth.  I bet she yells at him in that White House.  You're probably right with your theory, but you've got to throw it in there. 
[00:35:00]  That's Michelle Obama.  She seems a bit tough.  I would be there.  She's waiting for me.  I'm waiting for you, motherfucker.  I bet you there's some tough talk from her behind closed doors.  Yeah.  I bet the Secret Service have great stories.  Oh, fuck.  I cannot wait to hear some of those stories.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'll try not to do that again next time.  Because he comes across wimpy, kind of nerdy.  He does.  And she comes across as a tough broad. 
[00:35:30]  She's a little sassy.  She's sassy.  Like a fucking judge on a TV show.  Oh, yeah.  That are all black women and sassy.  She certainly could be that person.  You sit down, honey child.  I didn't ask you no question.  Absolutely.  It's like, how did you get through law school?  A producer makes Larry explain what the Zipper Club is.  Ah.  I mean, it took us a couple seconds, but we figured it out.  And Danny Googled it in two seconds.  He got your answer.  Because he didn't have to be dragged there. 
[00:36:00]  By the way, the suits wanted me to remind you what the Zipper Club is.  It's if you've had open heart surgery, they have to zip it up.  So I thought everyone in the world knew it, but apparently.  Bill and I look confused.  We did not get that.  We did not know that.  We were wondering.  I'm sure you did.  Ryan, do you have any questions for the president?  I'm glad you clarified that.  I see what you mean.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  It's funny.  Oh, that is funny.  He's implying Clinton's part of the Zipper Club because his cock was out and an intern was sucking it. 
[00:36:30]  God bless Clinton.  That's a funny line.  That is funny.  And that's what I'm talking about with Clinton.  Let loose a little bit.  Let loose.  I got my picture with you.  It don't matter anymore.  Wow.  Larry's...  He had 500,000 viewers at one point in the beginning of the week.  Yeah.  They said his last week even.  He was just...  He's dying.  He was dropping viewers day by day.  Dying.  Just bleeding viewers.  And here's Larry's final send-off from last night. 
[00:37:00]  It's not very often my life.  I've been without words.  But I want to thank everybody associated with this program.  Was that laughing?  All the people behind the scenes.  As I mentioned, Wendy and the staff.  The four people.  Everybody who makes it possible.  Even the suits at the top.  I love them, too.  When I started 25 years ago at a little studio in...  This is going great.  ...in Washington, D.C.  I never thought it would ever last this long. 
[00:37:30]  In Fresno, California.  He was 52 when he started.  He did radio before, right?  Oh, yeah, he did.  Jesus.  He was a radio guy.  Oh, it was right.  Rumors have it that he might go back to radio.  I'm sure Sirius will sign him for 80 million a year.  I didn't mean to use that number.  I'm actually more pissed at the...  Man, shit.  I shouldn't have said that number.  Sorry.  Fuck.  It's just a number.  It's just a number.  Because I was actually going after the other people that don't deserve shit.  That are getting ridiculous contracts around here.  Sorry. 
[00:38:00]  Anyway.  I just picked the wrong fuck.  Is that it?  No, it continues.  I never thought it would ever last this long or come to this.  So I'm going to go on, do a lot of other things.  We're going to do specials here on CNN.  I'm going to ask you another question.  You think?  I don't know why.  It's just funny to think of him.  I'm farting in his chair.  I'm going to go on and do other things.  I'm going to sit in the living room.  My wife has sex with a Spanish man.  I'm going to die.  Those are the things I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to be up to. 
[00:38:30]  She's more bummed than anyone.  He's going to be around all the time.  His broadcasting career is going to be him talking into his life call machine.  I've fallen and I can't get up.  I love when the veterans retire and they say, I'll be doing special projects still for CNN.  It's always some weird fucking thing and it's on in the middle of the night.  No one sees it.  No, you never see it.  Or on Saturday morning or something.  Really, what's he going to do?  I'm going to go on, do a lot of other things.  We're going to do specials here on CNN.  I'm going to be seeing other places.  Uh-oh. 
[00:39:00]  Do some radio.  Homes.  Be around baseball.  So you're not going to see me go away.  But you're not going to see me here on this set anymore.  For two weeks, they're going to be playing highlight shows.  So they will see you.  I am, I don't know what to say except to you.  Oh, it's breaking up.  My audience.  Cracking.  Thank you.  And instead of goodbye.  Thanks, Dan.  How about solo? 
[00:39:30]  How was I waiting for that?  That was a damn good one.  Worth the wait.  It was, that's hilarious, man.  So long, funny man.  There goes Larry.  Out the door.  See you later.  He had some amazing moments.  His Brando interview, if you watched that, Brando was such a tough guy to interview.  When they were kissing.  Dude, he had an amazing interview with Marlon Brando.  Unfortunately, he stayed too long, man. 
[00:40:00]  Larry was the guy.  He did.  People would bow to Larry King and how he did his interviews.  That's where you went.  He stayed around way too long.  If you wanted to be on the news, you wanted your point to get across, you wanted a product to plug,  plug, you went on Larry King.  Well, this is what we're going to do now.  We might as well keep this going.  Oh, we might as well.  We got the top Larry King moments of the past year.  Not of all time.  This is just the year.  This will be proof positive that he stayed way too long.  Yeah.  But it will also add to the mystery of why he didn't have more viewers when he's doing 
[00:40:30]  shit like this because I'm captivated by Larry's bumbling and stuttering.  Somebody should hire Larry and make believe like, no, man, Larry, we still think you really  got it.  Larry, you got it.  And just throw him on TV as a mess like he is.  You'll see me on, I'll be doing a live from the compound at Anthony's house.  You should hire him.  I'll hire him to just do a show from my basement.  You're not allowed to use your shit.  You might as well let Larry use your shit. 
[00:41:00]  Imagine going down into the basement and just feeding Larry.  Right.  He just stays in the studio.  I would hire him.  How about PFG TV with Scorch?  Scorch and Larry King.  I'm here with Larry King.  We're getting some more places.  I think Honolulu just picked us up.  Here's Scorch.  For the past year, the sixth top moment.  Larry and Willie Nelson.  Let's sing one.  Oh, no.  Let's you and I do one.  Want to do one? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Want to do Blue Skies?  Yeah, we can do Blue Skies.  Okay.  Want me to start?  Yeah.  Blue skies smiling at me.  Nothing but blue skies do I see.  Bloopers singing a song.  Nothing but bloopers from now on.  Never saw the sun shining so bright.  Bright.  Never saw things going so right.  Working in the day, worry at night.  When you're in love, my how it flies. 
[00:42:00]  Blue skies.  Blue days, all of them gone.  Nothing but blue skies from now on.  Holy shit, was that awful.  But it's like, who wants to watch that shit?  You want to watch someone with all of these news shows that get every bit of information?  Yeah.  I think people are fucking tired of softball interviews.  Nobody wants to see his softball interviews. 
[00:42:30]  Piers is going to be an asshole on that show.  Yeah.  And he can't.  Larry can't sing, obviously.  But it's not even just that he can't sing.  He's got that accent.  Where is the blue skies?  The smiling at me.  It's like a Borscht Belt comic.  Yeah, that's.  Kind of accent.  Is it a Jewish dialect kind of a thing that he's got there?  A little bit.  You know what kills me? 
[00:43:00]  And I don't know if this is a local spot.  It's for, what's his name?  Lerner?  David Lerner.  David Lerner.  David Lerner.  David Lerner now.  He's, yeah, take a tip from Poppy.  Take a tip from Poppy.  He's that guy.  Have you heard the commercial now where he does Shakespeare?  Dude, I can't take it.  Can we find that?  He goes, he goes, investing is a lot, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then he goes, remember that famous scene from Macbeth?  And then they put an echo on him. 
[00:43:30]  And he goes, out, out, brief candle.  Life is but a walking shadow.  And it's the worst delivery of Shakespeare I've ever heard.  Ever.  And when I hear it, I recite the lines over and over in my car because I can't get enough  of how bad it is.  Out, out, brief candle.  Now we got to.  Life is but a walking shadow.  Now we got to hear it.  If we can find that, that would be great.  It's Macbethstein.  Macbethberg. 
[00:44:00]  The top moments of 2010, Larry King.  Here's number five when he talked to Lady Gaga this past year.  Lady Gaga.  There's been a lot of stories and stories so often wrong about your health.  How are you?  I'm okay.  Thank you, Larry.  How are you?  I'm okay.  There you go.  That was terrific.  Wow.  What a thrilling moment that was.  Sure.  We move on.  Well, Larry plays the Seinfeld reunion the year after it happened. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, God.  That's great.  The cast of Seinfeld recently reunited on Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Let's take a look at some behind-the-scenes footage as they all walk onto the set.  It was a year ago.  Yeah.  Once again.  Let's watch.  Let's go back in time.  All right.  Jerry, it was a year ago.  It was a year ago.  Let's go back.  All right.  I think Jerry Seinfeld was the only one that called him out on his shit.  Yes, he was.  I think he was the only one.  Jerry would beat the shit out of Larry.  We could replay the whole Seinfeld interview. 
[00:45:00]  It's hysterical.  You don't know this, Larry.  Do you know who I am?  You don't know this.  The show was canceled.  It was number one.  Do you know who I am?  You don't know this.  It's just so annoying.  Oh, you missed Tommy Lee teaching him how to play drums.  Oh, God.  What is that?  It's one of his roids.  Yeah, no.  They're showing highlights everywhere.  Samurai sword fighting.  What the hell?  Heather Mills' leg.  That was Heather Mills.  Number three moment of the past year, Larry calls Ringo Starr. 
[00:45:30]  Well, let me just play this.  It looks like Marilyn Manson.  And what a story.  Where were you when John passed?  When John passed, I was in Sussex, in my home in Sussex.  Sussex.  That's where I was.  Somebody called you?  Yeah.  My manager at the time called me.  Did somebody call you?  Did someone call you?  What do you think?  No. 
[00:46:00]  My manager at the time called me.  And that was just a shock of all shocks.  George, where were you?  George.  No, this is Ringo.  Ringo, where were you?  I was in the Bahamas.  I was getting to it by George.  No, you weren't, Larry.  Shut up.  It's my turn.  I know, but you got your name wrong, Ringo.  I know.  Give it a break.  Anyway, I was in the Bahamas.  Oh, he called him out.  Paul called him out.  Yeah.  Larry, you got the name wrong. 
[00:46:30]  Did you hear that little bit of fucking real annoyance between Ringo and Paul?  Yeah, Ringo.  Oh, they hate it.  It's my turn.  Yeah.  Yeah, Ringo sounds like he's a complete asshole.  Let me.  I have to now tell you where I was.  I was in the Bahamas.  Doing what?  Playing a fucking casino?  And what Paul McCartney should have said.  What were you doing?  Paul McCartney should have said, look, Ringo, when you left the fucking studio, I redid all  your drum parts.  But go ahead.  Why don't you tell Larry where you were when Lennon died?  Did he really do that?  Ah, there's rumors.  Wow.  There's rumors that Ringo wasn't the best drummer.  He really wasn't. 
[00:47:00]  Where were you?  I mean, that part is not the rumor.  Everyone knows he was not the best drummer.  When you heard Ringo's career died, Paul, where were you?  Look at who the Pope's being entertained by.  Sorry to interrupt, Jant.  They just happened to show it.  It's all these shirtless athletes.  Like these shirtless.  Yeah, that's what the Pope is watching.  Of course he is.  That's good.  Terrific.  They're men with no shirts and tight pants, so their bulges show.  Oh, that's good.  Doing acrobatics.  These guys are just taking their shirts off.  They're stripping for the Pope.  Holy shit.  The Catholic religion is just fucked. 
[00:47:30]  What the fuck is he doing?  He's enjoying his life.  They're like I break dancing in front of the old Pope.  Look at his eyes.  No, that's the same Pope, bro.  Yeah, no, they just showed Pope John Paul for a second.  Oh, yeah, John Paul?  Yeah, they went to the...  I guess they're showing...  Oh, my God.  This is hilarious.  Look at the...  Good.  How did he resist just not getting up and...  Ugh.  A little squeeze.  Is Morning Joe laughing about it, hopefully?  I'm sure they are.  All right.  Jesus, you can't let that pass.  Because the Catholic Church is fair game.  But please don't mention the Muslims on that fucking Morning Joe show. 
[00:48:00]  Fuck him.  Fuck MSNBC.  Why are you saying fuck Morning Joe now?  Because they'll goof on.  They'll do that.  They'll fucking play the Pope being entertained by shirtless men, which is odd.  Believe me.  I'm not fucking defending.  I don't know what that was.  I'll find out.  It was very hot.  Do you see the bulges in their pants?  How do you not?  Are they where their asses are like little shelves?  Oh, my God.  Muscles?  Yeah.  Shirtless in front of the Pope?  Smooth abs?  I mean, so they could start laughing about that, which they were. 
[00:48:30]  But God forbid they cannot show some kind of Muslim thing and then make fun of that.  Oh, perish the thought.  Muslims aren't getting topless and doing...  Well, show the whipping.  Show the fucking whipping of that woman and then laugh.  But laugh about it.  Just like that's a part of their religion.  So you're saying...  Just laugh at it.  So you're saying only Fox News does it, right?  No, because even they don't fucking show it and laugh.  They're all petrified of the Muslims.  At least say that.  Everyone's petrified of the Muslims.  Fuck them!  Just say they suck across the board for the most part. 
[00:49:00]  Fox is just a little less lenient on Islam than the other networks.  The other ones just kowtow to them.  It's pathetic to watch.  Yeah, Fox is more likely to at least, I think, address the stuff, certain things with Islam.  Here is the runner-up top moment on Larry King of the past year.  What was that accent, Stephen?  Where is...  Talking to the guy from Avatar, the big Marine guy.  Ah, right.  The actor's name is Stephen Lang.  What was that accent, Stephen?  Where is he from? 
[00:49:30]  That's a Marine accent.  It's been my experience that the Jarhead clan almost has their own vernacular, their own accent.  It's a...  I'd say there's a bit of Virginia in there, a little Tidewater Virginia.  Um, and maybe a few other things as well.  It's made up.  Do you remember the movie A Few Good Men with Jack Nicholson, uh, played that incredible part?  Well, Stephen Lang did it on Broadway, and he was incredible with that, that great line, right? 
[00:50:00]  You wouldn't know the truth.  You can't handle the truth.  Yeah.  He goes, yeah.  Yeah, whatever that, whatever.  I'm just biding my time till I die.  You wouldn't know the truth.  You wouldn't know the truth.  I think Larry's the type of guy that probably just wung it.  Yeah, yeah.  He's one of those guys that just wings it, and then, uh, old age got to him, and he couldn't  wing it anymore.  77.  That famous unforgettable line, which I'm about to forget.  Right.  Yeah, he did say unforgettable as he forgets it. 
[00:50:30]  Something about the truth, justice, and the American way.  When you played Superman on Broadway, wait a minute, who?  I'm gonna make you a soup you can't refuse.  Didn't the good father say that?  Wasn't that a famous line?  What was some of the other famous lines?  Keep your friends close, and your friends close.  Isn't that what they said in the good father, too?  I believe that was one of the famous lines. 
[00:51:00]  Frankly, my dear, I don't understand.  Isn't that what they said?  I just don't care.  Frankly, my dear, I need some garlic and Welch's grape juice.  Frankly, my audience, where are you?  Because you're leaving rapidly.  Oh, he's a boob.  Oh, he's just an idiot.  I could have been somebody instead of a doddering fool, which is what I am. 
[00:51:30]  That's great.  He is the worst.  Just a fucking waste.  Five years.  Five years too long.  Definitely.  But we only started noticing a few years back.  Although at the end, the Motley Crue, when was that?  The Motley Crue.  Four years ago, maybe?  Five years ago?  I bet you it was longer than that.  We were on XM, though.  I think it was.  We were?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:52:00]  That was definitely a...  Because I think that was the moment we said, uh-oh, what's going on here?  Iraq, I think, was five years ago.  I think about five years ago.  Five years ago?  Okay.  Here's the top moment of 2010 on Larry King.  Joining Lauren Silver with us now is Deborah Tate, Roman Polanski's former sister-in-law,  the sister of the late Sharon Tate.  On a personal note, I knew Sharon Tate had interviewed her a couple months before a tragic murder.  What do you want to see happen?  I would like to see this whole thing go away.  I think that there's been a lot of time that has passed, and we need to bring it to an end. 
[00:52:30]  You ever talked to Roman Polanski?  I have.  Well, how can you have a civil conversation with someone who so brutally murdered your sister?  Roman didn't murder my sister.  I mean, well, I'm sorry, but when he...  The fact that he would have this terrible thing happen to him after the death of your sister  to once again focus you into the public light.  That's what I meant.  No, it isn't.  I don't have any problems with Roman whatsoever. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  What a dummy.  Wow.  Wow.  How do you fuck that up?  Wow.  Manson, any confusion with Roman Polanski?  Fucking the Manson fuck family.  And then he tried to get himself out of it and failed miserably.  Wonderful Sidney Poitier is here.  What was that famous line?  They call me Mr...  What was that one?  Why do they call you Mr. Tits?  That was Tibbs, Larry. 
[00:53:30]  They call me Mr. Tits.  Ah, shit.  You know how hard it was to not do an E-Rock joke there?  Of course.  Sorry, E-Rock.  I'm trying.  And in so doing you, you'd do an E-Rock joke.  Yes.  Yes.  I just swung with no confidence.  I bunted it out there.  All right.  Well, uh...  So, Mrs. Lincoln, did you like the play?  How was...  Were you upset that it was interrupted? 
[00:54:00]  Our American Cousin.  That famous play.  Did you get a refund on your...  Did you ever see the end of the play?  Or did it remind you of your husband's brains and the hat on the floor?  You know, I want to tell you how it ends, but it's a spoiler, so I won't say it.  You should see it, though.  It's very entertaining.  After James Earl Ray shot Abraham Lincoln.  I'm an idiot.  But he jumped to the stage and said, you don't know what the truth could be. 
[00:54:30]  That's a fucking moron.  Unbelievable.  Hey, what time do we have this phone-up today?  About nine?  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were cool.  We're interviewing...  The Secret Service guy.  Gerald Blaine, he was one of...  He was not there the day, but he wrote a book called The Kennedy Detail, and he was...  Was he the guy that was on the advance team for the next stop?  I think so, yeah.  He was...  But he knew all the guys who were there the day Kennedy was assassinated, and he was one  of JFK's Secret Service agents. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And he wrote a book, and I haven't read it, obviously.  I just got a copy yesterday.  He'll have some insight.  Yeah.  We'll talk to him later in the show.  Nine o'clock.  Well, we go to break with a big fucking production number here.  Yes.  As we remember the great Larry King.  He was once great.  We should say that today.  Once great.  Shouldn't kick him in the ass as he's leaving.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's after midnight, rockin' to the door, up until the morning, I'm gone, I'm gone. 
[00:55:30]  Ah, baby, why not?  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Who knew?  We didn't know.  Ah, fuck, it's Friday.  I say TGIF.  My kid met Santa Claus last night. 
[00:56:00]  What?  For the first time, I would gather.  At the Walt Whitman Mall.  The Walt Whitman Mall?  Going local.  You were out on Long Island, weren't you?  Did a little shopping at the Walt Whitman Mall.  Wow, that place is still there?  Yeah, it is.  I remember going there as a little kid.  Mommy would take me shopping.  And it would kill me because right before we were ready to leave, the door was right in sight.  Yeah.  And she'd be like, ooh, and veer off into another woman's clothing thing.  And I'd be like, ah!  That's what my girl did yesterday.  Let's get out of here. 
[00:56:30]  You see that light at the end of the tunnel?  Because shopping with your mom when you're a kid is horrifying.  It's just horrible.  It's ultra boring.  And they drag you around.  And then you see, like, all right, we're going.  And you see the big fucking doors, Walt Whitman Mall.  And you're like, oh, God.  And then she goes, oh!  And sees a dress in Macy's or something.  And now you're just stuck again.  It's terrorist tactics.  You go home today.  You go home today.  They give you your clothes back. 
[00:57:00]  And then they drive you around in a circle and bring you right back to where you were.  Mom did that in the mall.  So, kid saw Sandy?  Yeah.  I got sidetracked by another horrible childhood memory.  Terrible with those.  Did he cry or did he like it?  Nah, my kid didn't cry.  He was one of those crying fucking shitheads.  Really?  Shitheads.  Was he looking with wonder at Santa?  Not really.  Did he know he was there?  Yeah, he knew that something was going on. 
[00:57:30]  Something was up?  He's seven months old.  Now Danny's bringing up all these Santa pictures.  The Santa pictures.  The classic Santa pictures.  It's my favorite thing about the holidays.  Like, aside from presents and lights and snow and all that shit, it's everyone posts the  kid crying, screaming, like just in utter fear of Santa Claus.  And I love it.  That kid, this picture is one of the best I've ever seen.  And he's crying.  He's got the look of terror in his face.  And his hands are reaching out like, please take me away from this thing. 
[00:58:00]  This animal.  Santa is a scary dude.  They have a good Santa at the Walt Whitman Mall.  Yeah.  But the guy has no fucking personality whatsoever and could give a shit he was there.  Yeah.  He's one of those guys.  I'm like, you know what?  Just clocking in.  This is a fucking moment for us, so could you play it up a little bit, asshole?  Help us out.  He just sat there like just staring like, uh, duh.  It's so weird.  Like, when you're growing up, you know, you hear from the time that you're like three,  don't talk to strangers, don't talk to strangers, don't talk to strangers.  And then they sit you on a stranger's lap.  Right.  And then they make you tell them, like, what you want and shit like that. 
[00:58:30]  I always thought that was the strangest thing.  Like, I'm not supposed to talk, but you want me to, like, physically, like, put my ass on  this guy's crotch?  Only once a year you can be molested.  I think if you're a mall Santa Claus, I think you're a little creepy.  I think you gotta be a little creepy.  I don't think there's ever been a question about creepy mall Santas.  Yeah.  I was watching his hands the whole time, because I would knock out a Santa Claus in  a second.  Would you?  Oh, fuck you.  Clock a Santa right in his face?  Oh, hell yeah, I would.  But he could give a shit.  He could give a shit. 
[00:59:00]  So maybe I'm ruining his business.  Maybe you shouldn't go to the Santa Claus at the Walt Whitman Mall.  That's why you never know when me and Ann or Jimmy are out and about.  We could fuck up your whole business, because you don't do the right thing.  Yeah, look, now people aren't going to want to go, unless they like a strictly business Santa.  He was just staring off into the distance, like, when's five o'clock?  I had to play a Santa recently, which will be aired next week.  Oh, my God.  And there was kids coming in and doing the whole thing.  And we needed an infant, like, for one of the moments. 
[00:59:30]  But the kid kept crying.  So I don't know.  Well, we might not have to be able to do that one of the jokes.  You should have called me.  We would have jetted out to L.A.  My kid doesn't cry in these moments.  He doesn't cry.  He's cool.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Merry Christmas.  That's what you did?  Ah, it's one of your lines?  That's good.  A bunch of them.  I thought you were Santa.  I was.  For a second.  That's great.  Is this funny?  Because I see the video. 
[01:00:00]  Always sunny in Philadelphia.  It's one of the best, the greatest shows ever.  I'm behind, though.  I'm only on season four.  Yeah, well, you might want to stay there.  Oh, really?  A little drop-off?  This season hasn't exactly been the most stellar.  But it's still a funny show.  The Christmas special from last year, it takes kind of a little bit of setup.  But what's his face?  Charlie.  Charlie, thank you, Jesus.  Because it's assumed that his mother used to fuck the neighborhood Santa Claus. 
[01:00:30]  So he ends up going to the mall and sees a mall Santa and freaks out and goes up to Santa's lap.  You know, confronts him.  Christmas, huh?  Did you fuck my mom?  What?  Did you fuck my mom?  What do you mean?  Did you fuck my mom, Santa Claus?  Did you fuck my mom?  Did you fuck her?  Did you fuck my fucking mom? 
[01:01:00]  Did you fuck my mom, Santa?  Shut up!  I'm going to get him on.  I'm going to kill him on.  His mouth is bleeding.  What the fuck?  He just bit Santa's neck.  I love FX, right?  I love FX, by the way.  The only network with any balls is FX.  Louis can say what he wants.  There's only a couple of words, and Louis said what they were, I think, that you can't say.  They're like, cocksucker.  There's a couple of cunt.  But they're great, man. 
[01:01:30]  And always sunny.  It takes on every topic.  Being able to say.  Every topic.  They've done the Muslim thing.  They've done them all.  And they're not PC.  They'll say retards and all that stuff.  And it's just nice to see on, you know, basic cable, someone able to say something like, you know, Santa Claus, you know, did you fuck my mom, Santa Claus?  And then have his throat bitten out, pretty much.  And do you think one of FX is struggling with advertisers?  No.  Like, FX is like the basic cable channel.  One of my favorite episodes of Always Sunny was the abortion rally. 
[01:02:00]  And they're trying to pick up chicks at the abortion rally.  And they decide to go to the other side.  Yeah, they're not doing well on the one side.  So he jumps the fence and goes on the other side.  And then takes on their cause.  Yeah, that was a good one.  He changes his mind in the middle of the whole fucking rally.  And as he's climbing the fence to try to get to the other side, he's getting pelted by eggs and shit.  If people are watching your show and loving it, the advertisers will come.  Yep.  If there's a lot of viewers, the advertisers will fucking show up.  Bud Light is the official beer of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  So it's not like it's hurting them. 
[01:02:30]  There's no surprise there.  Bud Light used to love the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, yes.  Used to love us and remember what we used to do.  I wish they would come back.  Yeah, why aren't they?  To the fold.  They should come back.  I could use some kegs.  Good for fucking FX, man.  They should get on that down the hall.  Bud Weiser and Bud Light loves us.  Ryan, Nashville, what's going on?  Ryan.  Hey, guys.  I used to work in a group home for juvenile sexual offenders.  And one of the big fat kids that was there, before he got in there, he was a Santa Claus, a mall Santa Claus. 
[01:03:00]  And he had little kids on his lap for Jolly.  They caught him for that.  That's fantastic.  It was a bunch of lies.  Oh, were you ever a mall Santa, Uncle Paul?  Yes, I was.  Were you good?  Huh?  Were you good at it?  Yes, I was.  Now, do you still do it or were you let go?  There was a misunderstanding.  Oh, a misunderstanding.  Little liar.  There's always a misunderstanding with Uncle Paul.  Telling his mother and father a bunch of lies in the police.  And the police. 
[01:03:30]  I didn't do nothing wrong.  Hey.  You just asked him what he wanted for Christmas, right?  Yes.  So what do you want for Christmas?  Is that how you'd say it?  Sure.  It's a little creepy.  I'd say, why don't you leave a cookie for me?  Oh, is that it?  Would you make deals with the children?  Like, you'll give them their present if maybe Santa.  Kiss the magic eel and you get your Lincoln logs.  I've never heard Santa say, kiss the magic eel.  Kiss the Rudolph nose. 
[01:04:00]  Close your eyes.  Give Rudolph's nose a kiss.  It's awful warm.  Rudolph's happy.  It's warm and wet.  Yeah, look at that.  Let Rudolph spit on you.  You get exactly what you want.  Your Legos.  You want your Legos?  And what happens to us snitches on Christmas?  They don't get, they get coal in the stockin'.  They said, if you go out and tell your mother and father these lies, you're going to get coal in your stockin'. 
[01:04:30]  Stockin'.  But if not, you get all the gifts you want.  Either coal in the stockin' or a pink sock.  One or the other.  By the way, that clip is from the Christmas special that was only released on DVD.  That's why a lot of fucks.  That's a good one.  FX gets salty with the language, but I'm not really sure.  Maybe they don't say fuck.  Not multiple times.  Yeah, I don't know if they would allow it multiple times.  You know what, I forgot if at all.  I forgot that special was only on DVD. 
[01:05:00]  I didn't know that either.  I just got a little knowledge.  But fuck it, FX still, they still get away with murder over there, so.  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, Louie's show's great.  Speaking of Santa Claus, it's a couple days old, but we're a little behind.  Here's a Santa Claus story for you.  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus, but he better watch his mouth.  Best story of the day.  A Macy's in San Francisco gave a long-time Santa the boot after a couple complained that he told them a risque joke.  So here's the joke.  John Toomey acknowledged making a crack about being so happy and jolly because he knows where all the naughty boys and girls live. 
[01:05:30]  But he says he has used this joke on adult visitors for years.  You get fired for that?  Is that even a joke?  I don't even know what that was.  It stunk.  Terrible.  Adult visitors for years.  Well, Santa wasn't out of work for long.  He was hired by a local restaurant for a toy drive through Christmas Eve.  He gets double his Macy's salary and all he can eat and the freedom to tell any joke he wants. 
[01:06:00]  He actually was at Macy's for 20 years.  20 years.  And Macy's goes, yeah, you gotta go.  One complaint and they fire him.  Loyal service.  Fucking assholes.  This world fucking sucks.  Fucking assholes.  A tiny percentage of this world fucking sucks.  But for some reason they're able to get a lot done with their horse shit.  With their single complaint.  What was the joke even?  I don't even get it.  I don't know.  He knows where all the naughty boys and girls live.  He's so, Santa is so happy and jolly because he knows where all the naughty boys and girls live.  Which means he can go to their house and get blowjobs and fuck them. 
[01:06:30]  Sure.  Because they're naughty.  They are.  Uncle Paul.  You gotta punish them when they're bad.  Yeah?  Sure.  Yeah.  I thought Santa punished kids when they're bad by not coming around, not giving them what they want,  and of course the coal on the stuff.  You know what my favorite joke is?  It's great to be Santa.  Because you can't see when there's blood on the front of the suit.  Because it's red.  Yay.  Then you can come on the white parts and no one's the wiser. 
[01:07:00]  That's what I'm trying to say, Danny.  Me and your father had an argument about that when you was young.  Because you had like a little rump roast on your back there.  Little rump roast, Danny.  Yeah.  Yeah, it sure does.  Before it had hair on it.  Boo.  Boo.  Hey, puberty.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God.  Fucking guy gets fucking fired. 
[01:07:30]  You're fired.  We're making a big deal here in New York about LeBron James coming.  The big game tonight, I guess.  And playing the Knicks for the first time at the Garden.  Everyone's excited.  And ooh, you're nary a seat to be had.  I saw the courtside seats going for as much as $79,000.  That's impossible.  That has to be for the pair, obviously.  $79,000?  For one fucking game?  Who gives a shit?  To see LeBron James. 
[01:08:00]  Who cares?  The Knicks are really good this year, by the way.  You should be able to fuck his mother for that amount of money.  You know, Walt Frazier in this show got something going on.  Walt Frazier comes on the show, legendary Knick, right?  And says the Knicks are pretty good.  Oh.  And then they proceed to win like 11 straight or something like that.  Yeah.  Or 11 out of 12.  I forgot exactly what the streak was.  It's the opposite of the Islanders.  Yeah, they won last night.  Who gives a shit if they won?  Who cares?  Steve from Bay Show is very excited.  Yeah, I saw him tweet him.  I want to go over to his house and punch him in the face. 
[01:08:30]  What are you doing?  Don't support this team.  No.  Ow.  I did take a peek at the beginning of the game.  I had tickets, by the way, to last night's game, too.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  They're just going to waste.  Where are they now?  Some beach fucking on the south shore of Long Island?  Yeah, I didn't do anything with those.  Just fucking...  They're fluttering in some dead hooker's mouth.  I can make a video.  I can make two videos a week because I'm not going anywhere.  Anytime Sooner and I've got a stack of fucking tickets.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Now everyone's asking for the tickets.  I'm like, why would you want to go?  They showed the game yesterday.  I don't know if we could show it real fast.  There was a whole section of blue seats, meaning empty seats, right on the ice.  Really?  Like the whole section.  There wasn't one person that sat in that section.  No one went down.  To the beginning.  They don't let you because then the douchebag fucking assholes are all looking for a handout  to let you move down.  Can you slip them a little fucking money and get your ass down there?  Yeah.  If you grease their palm, they'll sometimes let you move down. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  You know.  That's nice.  But those assholes.  LeBron James, Madison Square Garden tonight.  Slip them a saw buck?  I guess.  I guess you can.  Saw buck.  Huh?  I don't even know what that is.  What is a saw buck?  It's like oldie time speak.  Is that a dollar though?  I slipped them a saw buck to get into the speakeasy.  Is that a five, Ant?  Is it a five?  I thought it was like a 20.  Really?  Or 20, a double saw buck. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know.  You're thinking a 10?  Danny will find it in two seconds.  Yeah, but if it's older than days, I would say it's a one.  No, because a buck, that would be a buck.  Huh?  $10 bill?  $10.  It's a place where you get your coffee in the morning.  I was going to say it's where you cut your dollar and a half and make 50 cents because  you just saw it a buck.  I was like, I don't know.  They're both the good.  Slying for a US 10 as well as $10 worth of marijuana.  Yeah.  Really?  It's a saw buck. 
[01:10:30]  Really?  When was that called a saw buck?  Probably in the 70s because I don't know that you could buy $10 worth of marijuana anymore.  I know.  That was called a dime bag.  And a big forefinger.  It was called a lid.  If I ever say marijuana again, please smack my face.  Marijuana.  Marijuana.  Mary Jane.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I remember buying lids of pot.  Now you just buy like, it's like you get one bud.  It's like $100.  Really?  And if you just look at it, you get high. 
[01:11:00]  And that's pretty much pot these days.  I used to get like a dime bag and you could roll.  A good dime bag was being able to get 10 or like 11 or maybe even a dozen joints out of  a dime bag.  A nickel, same thing.  Five joints.  Sure.  Out of a nickel bag.  Now it's, you know, you look at this shit.  It looks like it's from outer space.  You see that bag right there?  You see that bag right there?  It's like moon dust on it.  That's $60.  $60 for that bag.  What is it called? 
[01:11:30]  This one is Purple Bubba Kush.  Purple Bubba Kush is the shit.  And that thing is in one of those tiny little Ziploc bags that are no bigger than, you know,  three of your fingers and flat, like completely flattened out.  Just bud.  But I mean, I remember getting lids, the four finger lid for fucking like $20 or $40.  I forgot what it cost.  But it was all seeds, stems, and shake.  You put it on your album.  And after it was cleaned, you'd have like fucking nothing left. 
[01:12:00]  Couldn't you just grind down the seeds?  Nah.  That never worked.  It gave you a bad bitter taste.  It left a little harsh.  I never knew what to do with pot.  I was always happy when someone else was able to figure it out.  It's all about the vape.  The vape now.  The vape.  You vaporize that shit?  Is that what the fucking thing is, what the kids are doing these days?  What are the kids doing?  What are all the kids?  I don't know.  I think people have been doing this forever.  It's just like whenever you find it. 
[01:12:30]  Then it's new?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure people have been vaping for a while.  Vaping.  And that just like fucking, what does it do?  The weed?  It heats up.  Like, you don't smoke the pot.  You kind of just, you vaporize the THC crystals off it.  Oh, so I would guess you'd get a little more high.  So it's just, it really does fuck you up.  You don't get any of this?  No, no, no.  Because you're not inhaling.  There's no combustion.  So you're just...  How do you breathe it in?  Just like over a mask? 
[01:13:00]  No, no.  It's like a tube that you hook up.  And it doesn't taste like anything.  There's no smoke.  It's just, you think nothing happens.  Don't you hate not having the ritualistic joint thing of,  because that's kind of like part of smoking weed was always like,  you got the joint, you start running, and you got to lick it and fucking put some spit  where the run is.  I can never care about that.  Yeah, who gives a shit?  It's all about the end result.  Like, is it going to fuck me up in 20 minutes?  Am I high?  And you're not thinking.  Yeah.  This was invented for the kids going to college. 
[01:13:30]  Oh.  Because you always had to fucking try to keep the smoke in your dorm room.  Or the RA would get you.  So someone probably said, look, we could probably do this without the smell of the smoke in the  air.  Yeah, it doesn't...  Apparently, I mean...  That's what I'm thinking.  When my friend tried it, there was no smell or anything like that.  No real...  Really?  You didn't smell weed or nothing?  Nothing.  No smell.  Wow.  Some people say it smells a little bit like peanuts.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and they make portable ones where you could just...  You could literally...  I'm not even kidding.  If you made it onto a plane, you could totally smoke it in the bathroom and you'd be fine. 
[01:14:00]  It doesn't smell.  You're not smoking.  It's not smoke.  How paranoid would you be, though, in an airplane bathroom smoking weed?  But you're not smoking it.  You're vape.  You're vaporizing.  But if you realize that Danny was wrong, and that's how you're like, meh, meh, meh.  And you're like, oh, no, Danny was wrong.  Why not listen to Danny?  They're knocking on the door.  I was like, fuck!  Hey, it's not called a smoke-a-riser, is it?  Right.  It's a vape.  Boom.  It's a vape.  That's obvious.  You know, some kid, you know, figured this shit out for college. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I would guess that.  Vapor.  Because you would always put the towel down, but someone always would have to go to the  bathroom and fuck it all up.  Like, what?  You can't leave!  Colin on Imus Alert.  Huh?  Colin Quinn on Imus Alert.  All right.  We'll take a peek at that.  Hey, I was talking about hockey a second ago.  Call.  A video I just tweeted, but it's worth playing the audio version.  You hear about the teddy bears?  On the ice, yeah.  You've got to see this video.  It's unbelievable.  It really went to town. 
[01:15:00]  Hockey fans know tossing things onto the ice, that's quite common.  They've tossed hats, even an octopus.  But nothing compares to this tradition.  23,000 stuffed toys tossed onto the ice, which are then given to about 50 children's charities.  This is in Calgary from the Canadian Hockey League.  I mean, look at the rink.  I mean, it's just unbelievable to see.  And then the players, they take these toys, and they deliver them personally to places  like the Alberta Children's Hospital.  Now, it happens after the first goal is scored. 
[01:15:30]  It took about 45 minutes to clear off all of the animals.  Oh, and it ignited the home team.  The Calgary Hitmen to a 2-0 win over the Red Deer Rebels.  And for the full video, go to extra mustard on SI.com.  It lasts about five minutes, Natasha.  That is wild, yeah.  Yeah, it goes on and on and on forever.  Yeah, I didn't know they did it.  Look at the pile.  Yeah, that's really...  They're waist deep in teddy bears.  It would be fun to aim for people.  Stuffed animals, right?  I'm sure people do.  Whap someone in the fucking face with it.  Of course.  What the hell is that? 
[01:16:00]  A life-size fucking Spidey?  A little Spidey man.  That's pretty cool.  What the hell, right?  Ah, how nice during this holiday season.  Give it back.  Ugh.  I miss his on vacation.  What?  So...  Maybe that's an old interview.  Was it more erroneous information from the listener?  That never happens.  They're always right on the ball and right on the money with this information.  That's not true, Ant.  They make mistakes.  Really?  Yes.  Now you're getting bounced.  Hey, people talking about the Kevin Hart video, too.  Is this worth playing on the radio? 
[01:16:30]  I know the video's good.  Not much on the radio.  It's more him just talking and the girl's hair catches fire.  And then Kevin just loses his mind.  Yeah.  Was he at a P. Diddy party or something?  He was doing part of the party for him, yeah.  He leaves here and fucking hangs out with P. Diddy.  The Diddy.  Sean.  So we're one removed from P. Diddy at this point.  That's not bad for our careers.  Who knows where he stopped in between, though?  Yeah, that's true.  He may have worked his way up the ladder.  That's true.  He was, uh...  I'm up here in the hot tub, uh, doing an official, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:17:00]  My nigga Trey's up here.  Oh, my goodness.  My nigga Fab's up here.  Oh, my God.  When you have a scene like this, you gotta bring bosses with you.  As you see, it's female-friendly.  We got a lady that's a female.  She's butt ball.  Uh, that's what I call her.  All right, hold on.  Let me, uh, let me, uh, paint a picture, if you will.  That echoes.  They're leaning on a hot tub, a little bathtub-y thing that looks very nice.  There's some, uh, uh, black chick in the tub, and the tub is lined with little...  Candles everywhere.  What are they called? 
[01:17:30]  Votive candles and rose petals and stuff, and she has a big-ass weave on her fucking head,  that chick in the tub.  Big, curly...  But why are they doing this?  I don't get it.  They're at Diddy's house.  It's just doing a party.  He's just broadcasting a party.  This is what Diddy does.  Broadcasting it where, though?  It's a hotel.  Oh, it's a hotel.  But is this online?  He just broadcasts his shit online now?  I don't know.  I think Diddy just does this.  He gets a mic.  Maybe a podcast?  Yeah.  Fuck it.  It's Diddy.  I don't know.  Uh, I'm not jumping.  I'm not jumping to tub myself.  Uh, you know, once everybody gets out.  You know, it's just me and the lady. 
[01:18:00]  This is my thing.  I'm used to this type of thing.  The chick leans back a little too far.  One of the candles are back there.  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Oh!  Did the camera catch that?  Got the camera!  Oh!  Got the camera!  Got the camera!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  And this stupid broad is trying to, like, put out the fire with her hands.  She's in a bathtub!  Dunk your head, bitch!  Well, the swimming thing might come into play there.  We all hear about that.  Racist stuff.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  Uh, yeah, she's in a fucking bathtub that's full of water. 
[01:18:30]  She realizes her hair's on fire and she starts patting it out, trying to pat it out.  Right.  It's like, no, dummy.  Dunk your head, dummy.  Dunk your head.  Dunk your weave, bitch.  Dunk your weave!  Bitch got a dunk ho weave!  Sam, you had something to add or you just want air time?  What's up?  It's up to you.  You got something to add?  Well, it was on Ustream.  Ustream?  Yes.  So it was Ustream and a party.  That's where Live from the Compound broadcasts.  What's Live from the Compound? 
[01:19:00]  I actually, um...  You worked it out with those guys.  I'm in the process of...  Well, yeah, great.  Now that means we owe him a fucking favor.  Well, here's the deal.  I have to somehow come up with a viable way to promote the Opie and Anthony show and, of course, Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  So I got on my little graphics program and I made a nice little graphic that flies in and can fly out.  I can have it take up the whole screen.  And every so often, I pop it on the virtual screens or just full screen and go, hey, and you can catch blah-dee-blah-dee-blah. 
[01:19:30]  And then I continue with my drunken rants from my own basement on $150,000 worth of equipment that is gathering dust.  Yes!  Oh, oh, oh, he's writing.  All right, let's see.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was thinking that myself.  I have a contingency plan.  Hold on, I'm not done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was thinking that, too. 
[01:20:00]  I was thinking that, too.  Don't be foolish.  I have a couple of options.  Don't be foolish.  See, that was my plan A.  Unlike dumb purse lady, I do have a plan B.  You do have a plan B.  Which does have something a little more.  I know, I know.  You know plan B.  I'm going to lead with plan A.  That's not going to work.  Trust me.  I know, I know.  But then I'll, I could have something a little more subdued for the, you know, and then every 
[01:20:30]  so often the big one comes, and then permanently, 50% of the screen?  Wait a minute.  Right, right, right, right, right.  That's what's going to be said.  That's what I'm thinking.  I guarantee that.  Yeah.  Danny, could you destroy this place?  Right.  We now need a shredder in the studio for my new bit.  Danny is so right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course you won't do that, Ant.  Oh, God, no.  Do not do it. 
[01:21:00]  Never!  No, these, these guys always need a favor back.  I would never do that.  No.  They can't just say.  Mine.  They can't just say, yeah, you know what, that's really good for the company and the  Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we, that's all, it always has to be something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.  That's true.  That's why.  A lot of people have been victims of this.  That's why I don't film a lot of videos in studio, because they want all sorts of things  when that happens.  Hmm.  All sorts of fucking things. 
[01:21:30]  Well, I would like to get back to doing Live from the Compound, and I am, you know, for  the people that did enjoy the drunken babbles and phone calls, I am trying to get that  going.  That's the shredder?  It's going to take forever.  Is that a funny thing?  You think they spent money in this place?  Is that a cross shredder?  What do you got going there?  It's a single, single cut.  It's called The Danny.  Works pretty well, don't you?  And you really can't get injured by it.  The Danny 5000.  It won't nip your fingers.  And I can do CDs as well. 
[01:22:00]  Hey, Sam, while we have you in here, Sam went to a huge premiere for the Opie and Anthony  show, and we greatly appreciate that, sir.  I was busy getting a picture with Santa Claus, and you were doing the right thing, and you  went to the big movie premiere of...  How was Yogi Bear?  No, not Yogi Bear.  Of Little Fockers.  You got invited to the premiere?  Yeah, I was on the red carpet.  Did you go to the movie?  Did you meet De Niro?  I saw De Niro.  Did you go to the movie?  No, I did not go to...  I was invited to the red carpet, not to the actual movie. 
[01:22:30]  Why wouldn't they...  I know why we weren't invited.  Why?  Nobody's going to want to hear it.  Go ahead.  Because nobody speaks for this show.  We have nobody speaking for us.  So they don't think to invite the show, because the people making up those lists don't just  go, oh, let's get people.  Well, how'd you get on the red carpet?  They did...  Not Roland, actually.  Roland would have done it if he had the ability, but Liam and Annabella.  But wouldn't that lead to, and here's your ticket for the movie?  I don't know.  I don't know if press usually goes to the movie or not, to tell you the truth. 
[01:23:00]  I think they do.  Or they go to a screening, I guess, a press screening.  You might be right on that.  I don't know if press usually goes to the world premiere.  But they were good to...  We've gone to many of these premieres.  Safe to say there's plenty of seats for civilians.  Meaning us.  They did do a good job of getting me on the red carpet this time.  Yeah, and who'd you talk to for the big premiere?  You got Ben Stiller.  You got De Niro.  Like Jimmy said, you got Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Luke Wilson. 
[01:23:30]  This is not...  Owen Wilson.  Owen Wilson, excuse me.  I'm sorry.  Owen Wilson.  This is not actually the company's fault this time.  This is more an example of...  You know how you guys say that in the industry that radio is just...  Shit.  Shit, would be the word.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, that kind of relates also to...  So they stopped for all the TV cameras and then saw the Sirius XM satellite radio flag  and said, fuck that.  A lot of the non-actor Hollywood people who are just business people were passing by the  sign and acknowledging that the Paul McCartney concert was good the night before. 
[01:24:00]  Oh.  You know what, though?  That's good.  I said this a long time ago and I never got my check for this suggestion.  They should get rid of the name radio.  Radio just makes people go, ugh.  Yeah.  It really does in the entertainment business.  Especially when it says satellite radio.  So you should just have Sirius XM satellite or whatever.  Sirius XM entertainment.  Something.  But get rid of...  Entertainment.  If you just said SiriusXM.com, we'd probably have more pull. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  But radio is such a bad word in entertainment.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  And this place, you know, I'll pat him on the back today.  This place is way more than just radio.  Oh, really?  So why would you call yourself satellite radio at this point?  Yeah, really, man?  You can even...  20 million.  Huh?  20 million.  Yeah, but just say satellite even.  That says a lot.  Sirius XM satellite.  I like entertainment.  Entertainment.  Or entertainment.  Something.  Yeah.  But get rid of fucking radio.  I'm telling you.  Because they put like radio and magazines together on the red carpet. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  And so what they do is they get like a couple people who are literally going to hit every  single stop.  And then while magazine and radio are talking to those people, the A-listers just zoomed.  Just fly by.  Yeah.  They fly by.  Really, man.  I did get to see Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Owen Wilson, and Dustin Hoffman.  You saw them walk right by you?  With my eyes.  I saw them.  But the fact that this is where those publicists, and by them I don't mean ours, of course, 
[01:25:30]  I mean where they don't get it right is they don't realize how many people.  They'll put them on a morning news show, and there's a lot more fucking...  They'll put them on Larry King.  I know.  And there's more people listening to this show than watching Larry King.  No kidding.  We have more people listening to us than watching Larry King.  A lot more.  Absolutely.  And then what happens, if Sam does get a nice clip, then we pass it along to a bunch  of other channels, and now you're really starting to reach some people.  Synergy.  Yes.  Plus all the replays we do.  Yeah.  So you're hitting a lot of people with Sam's horse shit. 
[01:26:00]  I did get one question with Blythe Danner.  I like her.  She was in...  Blythe Danner.  I like her.  Whose mother is she?  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Right.  Okay.  Ah!  And she was in Great Santini.  She played the mother.  Oh, she was?  In that.  Blythe Danner's been in a lot of things.  But that'll be coming later.  That's not on the disc here.  But yeah, Sirius XM, I'm going to say it again.  I'll give it to you for free today.  Get rid of radio.  I'm telling you. 
[01:26:30]  Do you think they're going to listen?  No.  Of course not.  I'll take all this knowledge somewhere else where people will listen.  Of course they're not going to listen.  Sirius XM satellite even works.  Entertainment would be good.  But if you want to keep it short, just say satellite.  That means a lot.  But does radio help because the business is still getting it in cars and stuff?  Radio sucks a dick.  They need to get rid of the XM part two and just kind of call it one thing.  Well, to be fair, I did just say Sirius when I was on the red carpet.  I can't help myself. 
[01:27:00]  Sorry, boys.  That's where they were way too pompous during the merger.  XM makes way more sense than Sirius, but they were just obsessed with their side of the merger, Sirius.  XM makes sense.  AM, FM, XM.  XM, right.  But they did do a good job of getting me a spot on the carpet.  And to, I mean, the talent people's credit here, I was the only person from Sirius that got to go.  The talent people here, it's not their fault.  Yeah, and they did a good job with the show.  It's not their fault. 
[01:27:30]  It's the way people look at radio.  Yeah.  It's the way people look at radio.  Yeah, radio just is, you know, puts a bad taste in a lot of the celebrities' mouths.  And the reason that guys like Stern will get people is because his name is recognized.  It's almost like they don't look at him like a radio guy.  Yeah, when he goes down there, the Howard Stern show is here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the profile of the show has to be raised up.  So when they see it, they're like, oh, I read about those guys.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I mean by nobody speaking for the show.  They need something that will eventually turn into a memorable acronym. 
[01:28:00]  Remember when people used to call HBO Homebox?  Right.  Remember when you'd go, what's on Homebox?  Because Homebox Office, that's where HBO came from.  And then it just turned into HBO.  HBO, right.  And now you just know it as HBO.  But it was like, hey, what's on Homebox?  Right.  It's got to be SXM.  So, yes.  Then again, Showtime is just...  SXM.  So, I mean, if they don't agree with XM being stronger than Sirius, that's fine. 
[01:28:30]  Whatever.  That's their decision.  Then just make it Sirius, and then it becomes...  Cinema 100.  It becomes HBO, right?  Yeah.  But to have Sirius...  Danny says, call it Sirius has it totally.  And then we can make an acronym, and it'll be great.  Oh, wait, wait, I just...  Oh, hey!  That doesn't describe the company at all.  Dude, that'll be shit, though.  Still agree, Danny.  You made a mistake there.  You should be aware of that.  Fucking Danny. 
[01:29:00]  But to call your company Sirius XM Satellite Radio is way too fucking much.  It is.  Way too fucking much.  Let's say hi to Greg on Long Island.  Greg!  Saying hi to myself today.  I am.  Yes, what's up, man?  Sirius, you know, they name everything radio on all their channels, like Pearl Jam Radio  and stuff, because I guess they figure that the Sirius subscribers are too stupid to know  that they're listening to a radio.  And this is not trashing the company.  I think it's not a smart move. 
[01:29:30]  They really should get rid of the word radio and come up with something else.  Get a marketing company to figure it out.  And, dude, that's not for the listeners.  When they say, like, Pearl Jam Radio, that's for branding outside, for people who read about  it in the paper or hear about it.  That's not for the people who buy the service.  That's for people who they want to buy the service.  Yeah, but every channel ends with radio.  He's right.  But, I mean, that's why.  Rosie Radio.  Oprah Radio.  Yeah.  Radio Radio.  How about Martha Stewart Living Radio?  Radio, right.  I mean, how much longer can you make the title?  Right.  Sir, I'm only saying that's not for people who have XM Sirius here. 
[01:30:00]  That's for people who they want to buy it and go, oh, Oprah has radio?  Oh, Sirius.  They want you to associate, if you don't have the service, with this company.  That's radio.  We're echoing.  When you think radio.  Yeah, why are we echoing?  I don't know.  When you think radio, you think AM and FM.  So, when you think satellite, you're like, wow, Sirius.  XM.  I think ham.  Ham would be good.  Like E-Rock.  Because lunchtime.  It's always lunchtime. 
[01:30:30]  He's giving me the, that was unnecessary look.  Of course he is.  Can you change your name on, like, Twitter and stuff?  Yeah.  I have to, because I have to follow my own advice.  Oh, yeah, your name is Opie Radio.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Can I have a suggested name?  Yeah.  Opiekins.  Opiekins.  That'll go over great.  I like that.  Opiekins.  Opiekins.  The word radio is just not good.  Radio.  Not good.  How about the Opie Network? 
[01:31:00]  How about, uh, how about the Opie Kid?  That's K-E-E-E-I-U-SILENT-E-D.  Opie-G.  Easy to remember.  Very easy.  Right, right.  So Sam was at the premiere, um, interviewing, well, who'd you interview if everyone walked  by?  Well, I got to, uh, interview, I thought it was going to be a disaster, because the first  person that I got to talk to was, I think that's the first track, is the little kid in 
[01:31:30]  the movie, the little boy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  And you notice that's a short track, right?  Four seconds.  Right, so I thought things were going to go real south.  Yeah.  All right, well, here's four seconds.  South on a kid?  You're sick.  No, not like that.  The little kid from Meet the Fockers.  Yeah.  Meet the Fockers.  It's Fockers.  It's O.  Get it?  Let's just see it.  No, no, no.  Do you get it?  Meet the Fockers.  Right.  They're trying to make it sound like fuckers.  What?  That's the whole gag.  Oh.  Gay Lord Focker. 
[01:32:00]  See?  It's like, wow, what a wacky name.  It sounds like fucker, and we're getting away with saying it.  And the new movies.  Because these are little fuckers.  Yeah, the new movies should be just called Little Fuckers.  Little Fuckers.  I don't know if that has the same family appeal.  I agree with Denver Pass right here.  He says, enough with the fucking Fockers.  Enough with that franchise.  Well, I loved the first movie.  The first one.  To this day, when it's on TV, I stop every time and then check out a scene.  The first one was funny.  End it there.  Meet the Parents.  Wait, wait. 
[01:32:30]  Meet the Parents was the first one, right?  Then Meet the Fockers.  Meet the Fockers.  Meet the Fockers.  And then fuck you.  Little Fockers could be funny.  No, it can't.  I couldn't even tell you a scene in the second movie.  I never saw it.  Dustin Hoffman was in it.  I had a weird thing, though, where he was looking at Ben Stiller suspiciously.  And he was his two fingers pointing his eyes.  Yeah, I'm watching you.  It's always cool when a relationship doesn't change by the third film.  But now Ben is basically saying, well, I'm watching you as well.  See, that's good.  Watch out.  So De Niro's getting his comeuppance. 
[01:33:00]  That's right.  All right.  That's good.  That's good.  Because now there's some little Fockers involved.  I, uh...  De Niro's here.  Yeah.  You know, this movie...  That's Bob?  Yeah, you know me.  If I'm not raging, I gotta talk to the other Fockers.  Yeah.  It was very...  Not raging.  Good roll. 
[01:33:30]  Bob, you played tough guys for so many years.  What's it like in this franchise with the Fockers to really, you know, get your comedic chops out there?  It's nice to laugh, you know, especially since I was a taxi driver.  That's every De Niro interview.  But you know me.  I'll whack you.  Oh, boy, don't whack me out. 
[01:34:00]  Robert De Niro, wow, just amazing to be in your presence.  This time I whack you out with laughs.  That's exactly what he does.  It is.  He did a couple of TV interviews, and that's exactly...  I didn't hear his movie references, but they were short and quiet and breathing through the notes.  He doesn't answer.  They're like, they're one over yes or no answers.  Yeah, that's it.  Great cast.  Ben's very good. 
[01:34:30]  So, Ben Stiller, you know, very good director.  Was it hard to work with a younger director like that?  Worked with so many.  No, it's easy for me.  I work with anybody to get whacked.  Dustin's very good.  Oh, yes.  Dustin Hoffman.  What about Barbra Streisand?  Barbra's marvelous.  Yeah.  She's a legend. 
[01:35:00]  That's it.  Reiterates things.  Offers nothing.  Offers nothing.  No insights.  Terrible.  You know, but, you know, I'm watching you from the movie, ladies and gentlemen.  Bob De Niro, Robert De Niro, excuse me.  Oh, jeez, how horrible.  So, I guess I didn't need to talk to him.  No, that's exactly what it would have been.  Yeah.  Only more awkward.  Yeah.  Yes.  Horrid. 
[01:35:30]  So, what do we got?  We got Sam at the premiere.  Sam thinking he's getting a big interview with the little fucker.  The little boy.  Yeah, there's a boy and a girl.  The little fucker.  The little fucker.  He's one of the little fuckers.  One of the little fuckers.  It is an O.  They want to say fucker.  I'm not playing their game.  It's the whole joke.  Right.  It's fucking, look, we're able to say fuckers.  Right.  Because we're not really saying it, but we meet the fuckers.  You should ask him about the movie.  Like, mention the title, of course.  Rob, Bob, the joke about the title, it sort of is a double entendre thing. 
[01:36:00]  What title?  Meet the fucker.  What did you say?  Oh, I thought you said something else.  I'm getting in trouble out here.  I've got to watch it.  You know, it's kids.  Look at the poster, though.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Robert, you're staring right at Ben Stiller because you're watching him.  I've got my eyes on him.  But now Ben is watching you as well.  Watch out.  Tell him to watch.  Oh, God.  Look at that awful fucking movie poster.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's just De Niro and Ben Stiller, and they're staring at each other like Ben Stiller, who 
[01:36:30]  was the pussy in the first one.  Oh, yeah.  He's looking now like, don't you fuck with me.  I'm not a pussy anymore there.  I'm on to you.  And your games.  Oh.  I'm on to your fucking...  Were you afraid, Bob, that that would make you look a little, I don't know, wimpy in  this movie, being a tough guy?  No, I said to Ben, we'll put on the boxing gloves, then we'll see.  Ah, well, you know, being enraging bull. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, but he said, maybe we'll go deer hunting.  Tribeca.  Tribeca.  Triangle below canal.  New York.  Newspapers, cops.  That's perfect.  It's his city.  American Express.  Right.  Yeah.  Oof, Jesus.  That is brutal.  But it's so De Niro. 
[01:37:30]  Here's Sam talking to the little fucker from the new movie, The Little Fuckers.  Hey, we're here with a little kid from Meet the Parents.  Oh, you going in?  Sorry.  The fucking publicist, you hear?  Sorry, sorry.  Sorry.  It was only me, and like, I think there was one other, I think Televisa, Mexico was next  to me, and that was the end of the carpet.  Except that New York One got there late, and the guy was super pissed that he was on the  end of the carpet.  Oh, really?  Super pissed.  Fuck New York One. 
[01:38:00]  No one cares about New York One, it's awful.  So I thought that that was the way the evening was going to go.  So what, the publicist was like, eh.  She was like, I think we're going to bring the little guy in now.  Did he talk to TV?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He talked to TV, and then he talked to magazines, and then he talked to the internet.  I saw some of the interviews with the little fuckers.  Fuckers.  And they present themselves like they're 30-year-old people.  I know, like they're old people.  It is.  Child actors are weird.  If we could get a real interview with one of the little fuckers.  I did get with the girl.  Who's the girl?  Terry Polo? 
[01:38:30]  No, no, no, she's the adult.  Which one was she?  She's the wife of Ben Stiller's character.  Oh, right.  The carpet interviews suck.  And this is from anybody.  They're shit.  You've never gotten one piece of insight out of a red carpet interview.  Because nobody's got their guard down, and you have two seconds.  And the publicists surround them.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no shocking questions that are going to be asked.  So is this a good movie?  Yeah, it's a great project.  I mean, we all have a fun cast.  Everybody was great to work with.  Boo. 
[01:39:00]  Fucking boo.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, making his way up the red carpet is Fatty Arbuckle.  Let's ask him questions about a Coke bottle and a vagina.  And his publicist shoves you away.  I thought it was a good idea at the time.  I saw a cut in a Coke bottle.  What would you have done?  Cunt in a Coke bottle.  You heard it here, folks.  Thank you.  Fatty Arbuckle.  Cunt in a Coke bottle.  Otto had a funny joke many years ago.  He said it sounds like...  He goes something about paging Dr. Cock in a cunt. 
[01:39:30]  He said it sounds like something out of a Marx Brothers movie.  Like, paging Dr. Cock in a cunt.  You needed no water.  Dr. Cock in a cunt.  I don't know.  There's a lot of old school stuff.  I had dinner with Otto last night.  Oh, yeah?  He's well, yeah.  He's got me and my girlfriend, him and his girlfriend, and a couple other friends.  Oh, it must have been nice.  It was nice.  Yeah, he's doing well.  Very good.  Very good for Otto.  Let's continue with Sam's great fucking red carpet experience.  So far, dud.  Okay.  Sam talks to Terry Polo, who's Ben Stiller's wife in the movie.  Yeah, she was in... 
[01:40:00]  That's a big get.  Yeah, she was in all the movies.  She was one of the ones that was going from person to person so that the other stars could  just kind of run past while she was at, you know, so you can't...  She was running block.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  But it was good to get her.  We're here with Terry Polo.  With all the legends that you got to work with, who's the most intimidating to be on the set with?  Bob.  Me.  I think you better ask them how intimidating I was to that.  You know, they all were very scared when I was on the set. 
[01:40:30]  That's a good answer.  We have to move along.  And are you worried that they're going to run out of jokes to make with Fockers and they  won't be able to make any more movies?  No, because, you know, I actually heard new ones this time around.  I could not believe it.  So...  No, you didn't.  I think that it won't get old very fast.  Well, hopefully it stays around for a long, long time.  Oh, shut up.  Fucking weasel.  Oh, you pandering fucking cunt.  You fucking worm.  I think it's funny.  You should be sticking out of an apple, you worm.  You don't think there's anything to the subtlety behind it? 
[01:41:00]  A little bit.  What other jokes are there?  Well, they're going to move into a new neighborhood and their neighbors are going to be called the  cunts.  But they're going to use the K in the poster, so it's okay.  And the Z.  And the Z, right?  Cunts.  I talked to the writer of the film.  It's not on the disc, but he mentioned that they were throwing around, you know, just  laughing, Grand Fockers.  Ah.  How about Mother Fockers?  Yeah, that could be something like that.  A story about the mothers, you know, all together, and they go on a vacation, and they're 
[01:41:30]  all like, and they just say Mother Fockers all the time throughout the whole movie.  Instead of Little Fockers, how about Kid Fockers?  Kid Fockers is going to be good.  I like that.  But that would be funny if De Niro went to him and said, hey, where's your mother, Focker?  Oh, God.  You can see where that...  Sure.  Guys, why are you just giving this out for free?  You should be talking to the writers.  Let's see.  What is Rotten Tomatoes giving this fucking movie? 
[01:42:00]  Let's find out.  Let's go to Sean in Charlotte, who saw the movie last night.  How many fucking tomatoes?  How do you see this?  It's not until next Wednesday, Sean.  You guys love the show.  How are you?  How did you see this movie ahead of time, Sean?  Press screening.  I'm a critic.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Oh, shit.  I was on the red card critic.  I know you hate me right off the bat.  Aren't you a critic?  Animal Fockers.  I don't know what to make you guys cry more.  The fact that the big punchline is the fact that De Niro is trying to get Stiller to be the God Focker.  That's funny.  Or the fact that De Niro actually has a scene with Keitel in this movie. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, does he?  Together again?  Oh, it's fucking cringeworthy.  Is it painful?  And what does Keitel do?  Does he ask De Niro to park his cabin and look up at his window?  Even though that was fucking Scorsese?  She's fucking a nigger up there.  He's fucking.  That's what it was.  It would have been fun.  I really wish they just got Jay Moore and threw him in the park and had him do Keitel.  It would have been less embarrassing.  Oh, wow.  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  Whoa.  What is it?  There's no score yet.  The movie's out next Wednesday, and I think it has potential to be.  Sean could be the first critic.  What do you give this movie there, Sean?  I'm going to give it one and a half out of four.  One and a half.  What do you know?  Wow.  One and a half is actually for Owen Wilson, who's actually pretty funny in it.  I heard he was good.  I saw him.  Owen Wilson's a funny guy.  He does this, you know, well, he does the same thing that he does in the other two movies  because they don't do anything different.  They just take the first script and change a couple lines.  He's one of those guys, there's not many of them, that could be funny in a really bad movie. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  We can make a short list of people.  Bill Murray was always funny in bad movies until he got weird later in his career.  Who else?  John Candy, very funny in bad movies.  Always funny.  Who's Harry Crumb?  That's a funny movie.  Very funny in bad movies.  Who else do you add to that list?  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton, very funny in bad movies.  Jerry Sherbert.  Jerry Sherbert.  Sherbert.  Sherbert.  You expect us to believe that name? 
[01:44:00]  Farley?  How about Farley?  Farley never made a really great movie.  Jerry Sherbert.  Chris Farley, very funny in bad movies.  I've mentioned him before, but Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  Very funny.  Extremely funny in bad movies.  He's an action star.  He is, that's why.  But he would do really funny lines.  Like you'd throw someone off the building and go, all right, I've got to drop you off now.  That's a good one.  Bill Tetley's good.  He's the only action star under 160 pounds.  He's very slender with glasses.  Slight man. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  A lot of pens in his pocket.  Anyone else you could add to that short list of people that are funny in bad movies?  John Goodman.  Turk February.  Turk February.  He's very good.  He does abortion jokes, no matter what this scene calls for or not.  I like to see one of his movies.  Yeah.  See his catchphrase abortion joke.  That fucking planes, trains, and automobiles.  Saw another fucking, saw it again.  It's a wonderful movie.  It's hysterical.  It's a wonderful movie.  Hysterical.  Now, John Candy delivers the, I like me, where he's not sure of himself, but has to tell fucking 
[01:45:00]  Steve Martin, I like me.  I like me, yeah.  He stammers through that a little bit, that one word.  Yeah.  It's brilliant.  He was really good, just as an actor.  He was great in Only the Lonely, too, with Ally Sheedy and Maureen O'Hara.  It was like a comedy, but it had some serious moments to it.  He was very good in that.  I want to see every John Candy movie now.  Yeah.  Try Only the Lonely.  I haven't seen it in years, but I remember liking it.  I'm going to try it.  I'm going to try it.  I'm going to try it.  I'm going to try it.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, Uncle Buck was funny.  Go ahead.  We hang up on you.  Sorry about that. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, Uncle Saw Buck.  What does he say in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?  You're not as cunt, Steve.  Yeah.  The guy asks him how he's doing, and he goes, well, you know, still a million dollars  short of being a millionaire.  Still a million bucks shy of being a millionaire.  Yeah.  What a great line.  Just so happy.  Still a million bucks shy of being a millionaire.  But you know he uses the line wherever he goes because he thinks it kills.  It's hysterical everywhere.  Steve Martin was great in that as Neil Page.  You know why he was great in that movie, I finally figured out, because he really is 
[01:46:00]  an asshole.  So he was just playing himself.  I couldn't agree more.  I don't think he was doing a great job at acting.  I think he was just playing himself.  Yeah, face.  I'm supposed to be in first class.  What is that Rotten Tomatoes thing we got there?  There's one, and this is why I hate Rotten Tomatoes.  This is their one positive review for Meet, what is it?  Little Fuckers.  Little Fuckers.  We're not playing their game.  Louise Keller from somewhere, and her review is, a few morsels of hilarity and many that 
[01:46:30]  are cringeworthy.  That's a positive review.  And I remember there were a ton of those like that when Avatar was like the biggest thing  in the world.  Yeah, who gets to decide what's a good review and what's bad?  Is it the Rotten Tomatoes people?  It's a good call.  I don't know, because there's a lot of reviews like that where they're incredibly mediocre  and, in my opinion, far more negative than they are positive.  That's a bad review.  And yet they have their, you know, that's 100% on the tomato meter now.  That's a bad review. 
[01:47:00]  It's an absolutely bad review.  Let's be honest.  Little Fuckers is going to fucking blow.  No, there's no.  It comes out this Wednesday, and I think it could be very funny.  The first two were very funny.  Name any comedy franchise where the third movie was even close to good.  Oh, wow.  Name fucking one, please.  Right now.  Oh, shit.  Police Academy.  Caddyshack didn't even get a chance to do Caddyshack.  Police Academy 3 was very funny.  Exploded after two.  Let's see.  Could anyone come up with anything close? 
[01:47:30]  Will this be the first one?  The Fockers is, yeah, I think so, because it's not a franchise that's been done before.  Usually franchises don't even get a chance to get a third movie out.  Not comedies.  That's right, because they're usually not of this caliber.  What about Friday After Next?  Yeah, the Fridays.  Oh, shit.  Friday Series.  In person.  That's right, Ari.  The first one, hysterical funny.  Yeah.  And then just, what a drop-off.  What about the Borbershop?  Scary Movies by three was still funny, right?  I don't know. 
[01:48:00]  Scary Movie?  Scary Movie 2.  No.  I don't think Scary Movie 3 was funny.  How about the Police...  Not the Police Academy.  The...  Naked Gun 33 and a third.  Naked Gun.  They were kind of running out of gas.  Jokes.  That's the one that O.J. had the big afro and couldn't get through the door.  Very funny.  That was funny.  He couldn't get in to kill people.  Ann and Nicole Smith had a dick.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  Everybody's either dead or a murderer.  Leslie Nielsen and Ann and Nicole Smith.  Yeah, it is kind of good to watch now. 
[01:48:30]  Beverly Hills Cop 3.  Oh, God.  How was that bad?  Listen, I think Lil' Fockers has the potential to be very funny.  The cast is great.  Goddamn Rich in Connecticut.  He actually got one.  Did he?  See?  He's got one.  Let's go to Rich in Connecticut.  Rich?  Christmas Vacation.  Was the third movie in the fucking franchise.  And that's a funny movie.  And today I'll see you at the tournament.  All right.  Look at Rich being all cocky.  Rich from Connecticut.  He's out.  He's going to be in.  But they have Dustin Hoffman, who's funny. 
[01:49:00]  Ben Stiller, who's funny.  Yeah.  Owen Wilson is funny.  Too many fucking funny make not funny.  Robert De Niro is very funny.  No.  He's a talent.  He could be a good comedic actor, though.  Sam talks to the little girl from the movie.  Yeah, this is one of the other little fuckers.  Please tell me she sounds like a 30-year-old.  Proving my point.  Or do we have to go somewhere else?  No, I agree with you.  I hope it translates.  All right.  Here's another little fucker from the movie.  Looking at her, definitely.  Little fuckers.  We're here with Daisy from Little Fockers.  Daisy, how old are you? 
[01:49:30]  I'm eight.  And what's the name of the girl you play in the movie?  Samantha Focker.  And is Samantha Focker also eight?  Um, no, actually.  Surprisingly, she's supposed to be four for half of the movie.  And five for the rest of it.  Was that hard for you to play younger?  No, I just kind of acted like myself because she's supposed to be really sophisticated.  Was it intimidating to have to work with actors like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman?  I had never heard of anyone else except Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller. 
[01:50:00]  But when everybody told me how famous everyone else was, I was like, I should have known that.  So you've never seen Taxi Driver?  No.  Well, you should see it when you get a chance.  Best of luck to you.  An eight-year-old seeing Taxi Driver.  I got a squirrely look from the publicist for that one.  I bet you did, yeah.  You should live it when you get a chance.  I think she was a young hooker.  Of course she was.  A couple of questions Sam missed that were obvious.  Wow.  Oh, I just...  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, come on.  If you're asking somebody, how was it to play...  You should have said, did you have to shave your pussy to play younger?  That's not an appropriate question at all.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  I certainly would have not been invited back to another premiere if that had been the question.  No, no.  I think you've got more than a squirrely look from the publicist.  Are you sad Roman Polanski didn't direct this?  You missed that one?  Can you imagine how mad the publicist would have been if I had straight-faced, looked at  that little girl and said, did you have to shave your pussy to play younger? 
[01:51:00]  Why not, though?  Because it ruins reputation.  You should have asked her when she said she was eight.  You should have said, well, you ate before you were seven.  Oh, I can't get it.  Her pussy.  It would have been lost on her.  See?  Why did I open this can of worms?  No, I think, Sam, what?  You want a career on the red carpet?  I want a career in general.  Or do you want a career in radio, like a real career?  No, I think that the tax... 
[01:51:30]  You wouldn't have got kicked off the radio for saying that.  You just wouldn't be on the red carpet anymore.  Yeah, but I wouldn't.  And who cares?  Got any guests on the radio.  We've done a red carpet thing once, and we blew it off by putting Laverne and Shirley,  the retarded Laverne and Shirley, in our place.  Right.  Yeah, but now we have bad relationships with every publicist.  Let me play devil's advocate with Sam.  Oh.  Had you done that?  Yes.  Sirius would have fired you if you said to an eight-year-old, did you have to shave  your pussy?  They would have fired you.  I'm the representative from Sirius XM, not from the Opie and Anthony show.  They would have fired him in a second. 
[01:52:00]  The sign says Sirius XM Radio, and I said...  Yeah, you would be representing...  Yeah, but taxi driver was taking a chance.  But that's as much of a chance as I'll ever take.  Because one of the stars in the movie, like Jimmy said, was an underage hooker.  I want Sirius XM to know you can trust me on the red carpet.  What I'm saying is, I think if we get the audio to the right people, you still could get fired.  You were representing Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Have some pride.  Just trying to have a little fun without going over the top.  Right.  Hello, boy, Sam.  Right. 
[01:52:30]  Hey, good news.  Remember Mike from Baton Rouge?  Yes.  He was driving from Baton Rouge just to go to the Foxwoods Poker Tournament, which is happening today.  Yes.  Right after the show, a bunch of people are leaving for Foxwoods.  He was our first call of this morning, and they were in Virginia, I believe.  Right.  And how many miles away was he?  He was 400 and some odd.  72, maybe?  Yeah.  Mike, when you called two hours ago, how far were you from Foxwoods?  Mike?  Oh, boy.  Terrible, terrible wreck on the 95.  Oh, boy.  95. 
[01:53:00]  Mike is not there.  Flaming.  No, that's fine.  Hey, Sam talks to Kevin Hart, who was just on our show.  The day before.  Oh, yes.  Wow, you got nobody.  I did.  I got Terry.  Don't let me say that, because we already talked to Kevin Hart, so he's not going to  give you anything new.  I got Terry Polo.  I got the little kid.  I got Blythe Danner, who corrected me.  I said Blythe.  She said Blythe.  It's Blythe.  Blythe.  It's not my fault that got one of those weird names.  It's Blythe Brian.  Who was the asshole that corrected us in studio? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  And I wasn't brave enough.  I got to be honest.  I wasn't brave enough to say anything to him.  I don't remember who that was.  Uh, Terrell.  Yeah, T-O.  What did he say his name is?  Terrell.  Terrell.  Terrell.  Tyrell.  Terrell.  Terrell.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Yeah, you didn't.  And to this day, I hear everyone call him Terrell.  Yeah.  What's wrong with Peter?  It's easy.  Mike.  Bob.  Bill.  You got one of those weird names.  You got to just accept that people are going to mispronounce it all the fucking time.  Deal with it.  People are going to fuck it up.  You self-important shit.  It's not my problem.  She wasn't rude about it. 
[01:54:00]  She just said, my mother always told me.  Oh.  She was nice.  She was a nice lady.  Whatever.  You should have kicked her in the cunt.  Oh, wow.  No, I would never kick Blythe Danner in that area.  That would have been an immediate expulsion.  Sirius would have been.  From the red carpet, though, right?  Sam would have kept his job, though.  This company would have been so pissed if I had kicked Blythe Danner in her crotch.  Oh.  So pissed.  Oh, look at whatever.  I'm not going to say that word, Danny.  Riverdale.  NYPD.  Hosting the gun buyback program.  Gun buyback program in Harlem.  Boy, they're going to be giving out a lot of money. 
[01:54:30]  Which they prove doesn't really work, right?  No, they just get more.  They give them money for the guns, and then they just go and buy better guns.  We're getting guns off the street.  No, you're not.  I don't give a shit.  You're really not.  Okay, here's a...  You should let them have the shitty guns, because you see those shitty guns?  They can't.  You can't fire those things.  Yeah, they...  And then they give them money so they can buy, like, real guns.  They jam up and shit, right?  Yeah, of course they do, yo.  It's a stovepipe jam, bitch.  Sam talks to Kevin Hart, who's in Little Fuckers.  Fuckers.  Fuckers.  You're missing the subtlety of the joke if you say the F word. 
[01:55:00]  We don't feel like playing their game.  That has to be a joke.  How many times do I have to tell you?  We don't play their dumb game.  But when you guys do it, it's not funny.  It's just vulgar.  You could have got away with that.  Calling me a little kid a fucker?  Go, uh, so you're in the new movie Little Fuckers.  And then, you know, correct yourself, obviously.  I don't want to call a little kid a fucker.  Knowing the whole time you did it on purpose in your own head.  Her mom's probably on the red carpet.  Yeah, that's why you correct yourself.  Like, I mean, fuckers.  Asshole radio guy calling her a little kid a fucker.  Here's Kevin Hart.  Uh, I mean, we didn't cross paths yesterday, but I worked for Opie and Anthony. 
[01:55:30]  You were on the show yesterday.  Oh, yeah, I had a ball.  Here's the question, though.  You're walking the red carpet.  All these A-listers are on the movie poster you're in.  Yes.  Why is it a guy like Jim Norton or a guy like Patrice O'Neal never gets to walk a red carpet like this?  Well, here's the thing you've got to understand about Jim Norton and Patrice O'Neal.  They're never going to make it.  No.  You know, for one, they're two of the most unattractive guys that I've ever personally met in my life.  For two, you know, with talent, you need it.  And you don't name those guys? 
[01:56:00]  No.  Not there.  No.  Not at all.  But they're good guys, you know.  At the end of the day, you know.  They're good people, but.  They're good people.  But, you know, for this business, it's not really going to happen.  I mean, Jim Norton has a face for radio.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, people don't understand what that means.  It basically means he doesn't have a face for camera.  Right.  But he's a good guy.  You know.  No matter what you say, you just follow it.  But he's a good guy.  Right, right.  Patrice is a great guy.  So, you know, you're a good guy because you say he's a good guy.  You know what?  These guys are great. 
[01:56:30]  You know.  At the end of the day, it's, you know, we'll see what happens.  But I just don't see this ever being in the future, you know.  Actually, if you can, I'm going to touch the red carpet and just give it to Jim for me.  Just tell me what it feels like.  It's about as close as he'll get, I guess.  It's about as close as he'll get to my touch to going to him.  All right.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thank you, man.  Take it easy.  Oh, boy.  He was very mean.  I didn't think he was going to.  I thought he was going to be nicer.  I happen to make love to the camera.  I'm like Coco in fame. 
[01:57:00]  Coco.  Good old Coco.  I liked how, was it, Patrice that said he can't wait until he looks like Gary Coleman?  So, yeah, the movie comes out next Wednesday, and I'll bet it will be funny.  It's definitely worth at least checking out.  It'll be fucking hilarious.  Fucking.  I get it.  Let's say hi to Los Angeles.  What's up, Los Angeles?  Hey, how's it going?  You got something on the little fuckers?  Fockers.  Fuckers.  Yes. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  The, you always know it's a good sign when the director is nearly fired, and then Dustin  Hoffman filmed all his scenes months after the principal photography, only a few months  ago.  So, that's always a good sign.  They're busy people.  Dustin Hoffman probably has a lot on his plate.  Is that the word on the street, as far as this movie goes?  Everybody was in very good spirits at the premiere.  This movie's going to stink.  Very good spirits.  And the franchise.  The director, the producer, I spoke to the producer, she was happy, the writer was happy. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, that's good.  At least they were all positive on the red carpet.  That's cool.  Yeah.  It doesn't happen every time.  No, that's usually where they'll give you the dirt.  Yes.  It really sucks.  This movie's terrible.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  No, I think it's going to be funny.  Oh, that is Robin Williams.  All I saw is Afghanistan, and I see Robin Williams looking like a jihadist.  He's over there now, yeah.  He is?  What's he doing?  Fighting?  No, him and...  Thank you for your service.  Thank you for your service. 
[01:58:30]  But that's what made me think of, wow, Kevin's all over fucking CNN?  Jesus.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  This is a YouTube sensation.  Yep.  Yep.  And he's going to fucking be all over it.  Damn.  Damn, motherfucker!  Look at that shit!  The big thing I call the fire, motherfucker!  That's pretty much it.  It is funny.  Dummy.  That's great.  Good for him.  Stupid bimbo's hair catches on fire.  Good for her.  All right, well...  Pat it out in a tub of water, you dolt. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you, Sam, for doing the red carpet thing with the little fuckers thing.  And thanks to Liam and Annabella for hooking it up.  Are we getting any stars from that movie?  Terry Polo is the only person who came to the series.  We got Kevin Hart for the movie.  And then Terry Polo came by here as well.  Okay.  But not our show.  No, I mean, she didn't...  We probably turned her down.  Jimmy Carter said something.  We'll tell you what it is next.  Stay there.  I gotta know.  All the Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  We got Gerald Blaine. 
[01:59:30]  Let's not forget.  We haven't promoted it in a little while.  JFK's Secret Service agent.  He wrote a book.  Yes.  Made the rounds with the book.  And we're like, hey, we gotta get him on.  We like the JFK thing.  He also protected Eisenhower and Johnson.  I know JFK is the big get there.  But, wow, what a career.  Who's Johnson? 
[02:00:00]  Probably Ray J. Johnson.  Lyndon Baines Johnson.  Married to Lady Bird.  What kind of name is that?  She wasn't a lady.  She was a little rough looking.  Oh, was she?  Was she ever?  LBJ got a little weird after his presidency, too.  Yeah, he grew his hair long.  I think he became like a hippie.  He did, right?  Yeah.  I think he felt a little guilty.  Could have been.  Do you think this guy will talk about that? 
[02:00:30]  Probably not.  He'll probably keep it on the up and up.  Who knows?  Who knows what these guys are ready to expose?  If you're going to buy the lies of JFK's Secret Service,  you're talking to the inner circle.  You're not getting honesty like you do from me.  Shut up.  God, is he the worst.  There's a cool picture of Kennedy in here, too, from Atlantic City. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah?  Atlantic City?  Yeah.  Really?  Kennedy was in Atlantic City?  He really was.  What was he doing there?  Comedy show.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Do you have any details on that?  Apparently, he was a big fan of Jim Brewer, myself, David Tell, and Bill Byrne.  He was so mad that a third show had been added to Saturday, January 15th, the late show.  When you at least try to make it believable.  That's true, though.  I would never lie about JFK.  What, is he in a time machine? 
[02:01:30]  So that's on sale now.  But also, I didn't realize there's an internet pre-sale happening right now for the February 9th Beacon Theater show.  So this is for Geraldo's kids.  All money, I believe, is going to them or where the fund's set up in their name.  I don't know exactly, but it's a charity for his children.  Seinfeld is headlining it.  Colin Quinn.  Tom Popp is the host.  Myself, Ted Alexandro, Jesse Joyce, Judy Gold, Louis Black.  It's an unbelievable show. 
[02:02:00]  February 9th.  Ticket's on sale tomorrow, but there's an internet pre-sale right now.  And also, there's these amazing packages.  That have, like, signed posters.  Their VIP packages are expensive, but again, it's a charity.  So I don't care about it.  Charity event.  Sign stuff.  There's a backstage.  Seinfeld getting involved.  Yeah, Seinfeld.  That's really cool.  You know he's doing that to help.  I mean, he doesn't really get involved with a lot of that type of thing.  No, he doesn't do bullshit stuff.  But I think for another fellow comedian.  Yeah, he knows this is a real situation.  Yeah, Greg has three boys.  And it's unfortunate they're going to have to go through life without their father. 
[02:02:30]  And, you know, it's like you want to at least be able to get.  Because, you know, Greg would have wanted them to go to college.  And, you know, his ex, of course, wants them to have good lives.  They want to just be stand-ups?  All of them?  I don't know.  I wonder if he would have wanted them to be comics.  You never know.  It's not a bad profession.  There's a lot of uncertainty.  As a nation, we've got to stop obsessing about college.  So over it.  So over it.  Oh, we've got to get the college fund together.  No, you don't.  Yeah, whatever.  Try your luck.  Roll the dice. 
[02:03:00]  It's kind of a scam.  Play poker.  It really is a scam going on there.  Yeah.  Well, this is just so their lives are better.  So, yeah.  Just.  But a lot of people think you need to throw your kid in college to make their life better.  And I'm starting to think that is not necessarily the case.  Put them in insta-debt.  Insta-debt.  Right.  Insta-debt.  You're in debt for the second you start your life.  Yeah, we've done a bit, I guess.  But you know our take on that.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy Carter.  So Jimmy Carter says, America is ready to elect a gay president. 
[02:03:30]  Why did he say this?  Yeah.  Where did that come from?  Eventually, we'll have every type of president.  Gay's going to be a little rough.  We're not ready for a gay president.  I don't think.  Yeah.  You've got to go female president first, right?  Oh, yeah.  They'll be female before gay.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's for sure.  And he predicts it will be in the near future.  He's crazy.  Although I did say there wasn't going to be a black president for, you know, a thousand years.  President Carter thinks America is ready to elect a gay commander-in-chief.  I think the entire population of America has come tremendous strides forward in dealing with the issue of the gay. 
[02:04:00]  They can't even fucking pass gay marriage things in every fucking city, even in liberal California, in every state.  They can't even pass that.  You think they're going to elect a gay guy?  You think even gay governors?  Look at that.  With a jersey.  With that fruit.  That was his name?  We forgot a long time ago. 
[02:04:30]  Jim McGreevy.  McGreevy.  Jim McGreevy.  You know, he had to hide the whole thing.  Or if he came out as being gay, you think he would have gotten elected?  Did he get elected or did he get thrown in there?  Do you think we've already had a gay mayor in New York City?  I think we had a mayor that adored cock.  I think we had slash have a few.  That's what I'm saying.  There's a few you can pick from.  I think old Ed Koch was a little light in the loafers. 
[02:05:00]  That's my personal opinion.  Where's he at with that?  He was never really seen with any romantic interests or anything.  Either way?  No.  Did he ever have a wife?  No.  I don't think Ed Koch was ever married.  Did he ever have a goyle friend?  I don't remember Ed Koch ever having a girlfriend.  No, say it like that.  A goyle.  A goyle friend.  A goyle friend.  I don't think I ever had a girlfriend.  And then, well, Giuliani loved the pussy. 
[02:05:30]  That guy.  He made that clear.  Got rid of that wife and just started fucking around.  Got rid of that wife to the point his kids hate him.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's see.  Or maybe one out of the two, I don't know.  Hey, yeah, don't do it.  Ed Koch says it's unacceptable to ask if he's gay.  Meaning.  Meaning.  Of course.  No one says that unless they adore cock.  Meaning.  Which who cares if he likes it?  And he loves those suspenders.  Not that there's anything wrong with it. 
[02:06:00]  You know what the suspenders are all about.  Oh, you could grab onto him easy?  And then pull him forward.  Yeah.  Pull him on.  You know what you do?  The guy behind puts his arms through his suspenders also.  Yeah.  So Ed can't run away.  You just got your dick in him and he's trying to get away and he can't.  Unacceptable to ask him.  Yeah.  Don't ask me.  I'm sorry we're asking.  Don't ask her.  Don't tell her.  He's getting a bridge though, right?  Yeah.  The Queensborough Bridge.  Nuff said.  Nuff said.  Shouldn't they have given him the Kingsborough?  No.  The Queen. 
[02:06:30]  The King of New York.  The Queen.  Joan Rivers had a good tweet about that.  Ah, what'd she say?  She said with New York City going broke, you know, they're spending money on fucking changing  the name.  It would be cheaper for Ed Koch to change his name to Queensborough.  Ah, that's a good one.  That's a good one.  And then the bridge is named after him and then we don't spend the money.  Oh.  For the record, Mr. Koch, a long life bachelor, declines to say whether he is gay.  Quote, I do not want to add to the acceptability of asking every candidate, are you straight 
[02:07:00]  or gay or lesbian?  And make it a legitimate question so I don't submit to that question.  I don't care if people think I'm gay because I don't answer it.  I'm flattered that at 84 people are interested in my sex life and it's quite limited.  That is a gay man's answer.  That is a, I don't want to say I'm gay.  Did we, did we have an idea when we were growing up when Ed Koch was the mayor?  Yeah, yeah.  They were always kind of hinting.  I was fucking isolated out there and sent a poor lawyer out. 
[02:07:30]  You didn't know?  I didn't know.  Didn't have a girl.  I mean, and like, what's, what's Koch afraid of at this point?  Like, he doesn't have any political career to, to, to explode.  So why wouldn't he just be like, yeah, I nosh on pussy.  What's up?  What's up with that?  Yeah.  Be, be fucking like straight.  If you're not gay, then be straight.  I like, oh, I love girls.  Or just take it, you know, go the other way and just give some over the top, you know,  I, you know.  Yeah.  So like, why, why at 84 when you're, you don't have a foot in politics anymore?  Why does it matter?  Someone is saying we already had a gay president. 
[02:08:00]  And before I go to this call from Vinny from Brooklyn, I think he's going to give us a real  answer here.  Who do you think was the gay president?  Andrew Jackson.  Give me a list of, give me a, give me one of those fucking websites where they show all  the pictures of the presidents.  I think Roosevelt.  Roosevelt.  John Quincy Adams.  John Quincy Adams.  Because, uh, I'm going to go with Taft.  Eleanor was apparently a rug muncher.  So I say that, uh, maybe that was an arrangement.  Ah.  Oh.  Let's take a look here at the list of presidents.  Let's see. 
[02:08:30]  Here we go.  The presidents.  Give me a whole, all right.  Let's start from the beginning.  Well, they're all wearing wigs in the early ones.  All right.  But they're all dressed like fucking drag queens.  We could do this fast though.  Let's go through and see which one might look a little, uh, uh, uh, no.  Oh, James Monroe.  All right.  Let's start with John C.  Calhoun.  Let's start with James, uh, Monroe.  Move backwards.  Uh, look at James Monroe.  Okay.  James Monroe looks a little light.  Whoa.  Yeah.  How about, how about James Monroe?  Oh, fuck.  What a faggot James Monroe was. 
[02:09:00]  Wow.  If that guy didn't suck a few dicks.  Wow.  He's wearing an ascot to soak up the cum that drips off his chin.  No, he's ascot cumming it.  By the way, we're doing this for entertainment purposes.  We don't know if these people were gay.  You know what?  I'm saying he was a fag.  But he was assuming he's dead.  Hey, go back.  Go back.  Go, start over again.  Well, let's make sure we didn't miss anyone.  George Washington was all mad.  Then you got the John Adams. 
[02:09:30]  The Adamses weren't fucking gay.  John Adams, uh, no.  Thomas Jefferson?  Jefferson, no.  He was banging the black slaves.  James Madison.  Let's make his picture big.  James Madison.  Let's look at him.  The fourth president of the United States.  Okay.  Nah, he's a man.  Oh, come on.  Nah, he's a man.  Yeah.  Although he does look like one of the Lemon Party guys.  He also looks like he's a vampire.  Yeah, Nas Farah.  He's like Dracula.  Nah, he doesn't look that gay.  There was a rumor that he was addicted to Webster's taint. 
[02:10:00]  Daniel Webster's?  Daniel Webster's taint scent.  He'll put it on his fingers.  We did, uh, Monroe.  Monroe looks great.  John Quincy Adams.  No.  Andrew Jackson.  Don't even talk about Andrew Jackson being gay.  That's the guy.  Ah, Martin Van Buren.  Martin Van Buren.  Martin Van Buren.  Martin Van Buren.  Let's look at Marty Van Buren.  Nah, he's not good.  Marty's all right.  He looks like Ed Koch, though.  Marty looks like, uh, a kid that's true.  That's when presidents could just be fucking ugly.  Look at him.  What is he holding in his hand, in that portrait?  Hopefully it's like stacks of money. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, just what it looks like to be for the president.  To buy some slaves with and shit.  He's got a fucking Larry fine hairdo.  We're going to let Martin Van Buren go.  Yeah, we'll give him a pass.  We'll give him a pass.  Because Vinny's saying we already had a gay president.  All right, let's go back to the list.  Now we move on to William Henry Harrison.  No, you can tell.  Look at him.  You sure?  Yeah, look.  He looks like fucking...  Oh my God.  Oh, come on, dude.  Come on.  He looks like a producer on Broadway, that guy. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, you think he looks a little like...  Come on, man.  He's like Tommy Toon.  He's got the gay eyes.  The gay eyes?  He's a suspect.  Gay eyes.  He's a suspect.  We'll give him a suspect.  Suspect.  Suspect gay.  All right.  Was he married?  What do we know about William Henry Harrison?  He was in the wig party.  Uh-oh.  Hang on.  Wig.  William...  Dude, come on.  Look at this guy.  President.  He looks like he had a young lover. 
[02:11:30]  Do you think?  Was he married?  It looks like he had a little boy toy.  Marriage and family.  Marriage and family.  I'm not even going to give the whole beard thing.  So gay.  He had ten children.  I rest my case.  Ten children?  He wanted everyone to go, look, man.  I'm not gay.  He was doing some fucking...  Here's my tenth kid.  He was doing some fucking...  Come on.  You gotta...  All right, let's go back to the portraits.  You gotta give this guy his straight.  Definitely.  Oh, yeah.  Harrison was the guy, thank you, Iraq, that died 30 days in office.  Was he the flu guy? 
[02:12:00]  The flu guy.  He was the guy that decided, I don't need to wear a fucking coat for my inauguration because  I want to look good.  Was that him?  Yeah.  And they got the flu and that pneumonia.  That'll happen.  John Tyler.  We don't know much about this John Tyler guy.  The tenth president of the United States of America.  What do you think of that?  Why do they all look gay in their portraits?  That's what I'm saying.  They're all putting on the gay face.  John Tyler.  Look how he's sitting.  Yeah.  Two-hour speech in the winter.  That killed him, I guess.  That's right.  Yeah.  Very good. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  Let's move on from John Tyler.  Although his legs are a little too spread for a president.  Yeah.  Let's show this guy.  Zachary Taylor.  Oh, James Polk.  We don't have to look at James Polk.  We don't have to look at Zachary Taylor.  Millard Fillmore.  All right.  Let's look at Millard Fillmore.  Another wig.  The thirteenth president of the United States of America.  Nah.  He looks like a businessman.  Yeah.  We'll give him a pass.  He looks like Bernie Madoff.  Yeah.  All right.  Moving back.  Who's next? 
[02:13:00]  Franklin Pierce.  Yeah.  Let's look at Franklin Pierce.  We're trying to move through this, but.  All right.  What's that?  Yeah.  He's suspect.  Franklin Pierce looks like the emo kid from South Park.  He did have emo hair.  Franklin Pierce was the first person with emo hair.  He's got that horrible part, and then the hair is really high.  It looks like he's in a cure.  Yeah.  He was our first emo president.  We'll give him that.  First emo president.  Which makes you suspect.  It makes you suspect, though.  Nah, they're kind of androgynous. 
[02:13:30]  What do you think of this guy?  I don't even know his name already.  Franklin Pierce.  Jimmy's back.  Impossible.  He looks a little like Michael Richards.  It's a little.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, very good.  Yeah, so hopefully he had the same rantings.  I probably did.  All right.  Moving on.  We're going to try to zip through this.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it'll get easier.  The internet's a little slower.  Okay.  Franklin Pierce.  We got James Buchanan.  James Buchanan.  Pop him up.  He's big and fat. 
[02:14:00]  Because the next one's Abe Lincoln.  We're not even going to fucking go there.  Well, why?  We could.  No, actually, there's been rumors about this.  Yeah, there have been.  Oh, yeah.  He's gay.  First emo cut.  This is the first faux hawk.  Faux hawk.  He's got a faux hawk.  This guy.  I am saying gay.  So gay.  Full gay.  It looks like he has lipstick on.  Yeah, totally gay.  He's big, pudgy.  Yeah.  He's a little bear.  He looks like.  He's a bear.  No, he looks like an old queen.  Yeah.  Isn't he getting blown in the Overlook Hotel?  Yeah, that's what he looks like, too.  And now the next president. 
[02:14:30]  Wait, James Buchanan.  Thank you, Brandon Baker from Atlanta.  Getting some knowledge here.  He was probably the first gay president.  He never married and lived with a male friend whom Andrew Jackson referred to as Miss Nancy.  He was also one of the worst presidents ever.  Can we go back to James Buchanan?  Did you guys know this?  Oh, this is the one we're doing.  Oh, shit.  Okay, and we said it, too.  Wow.  He looks like an old fucking queen.  Let's see.  What do they say about him?  The president of the United States, often called Buchanan by his contemporaries.  Oh, you missed the very important line here. 
[02:15:00]  To date, he's the only president, oh, from the state of Pennsylvania, and the only lifelong bachelor.  Lifelong bachelor.  The only lifelong bachelor.  Experienced state politician.  Let me see if we can find out.  Lifelong bachelor.  Controversial.  Lifelong bachelor is a way of saying it.  Vinny in Brooklyn, was that the guy you were talking about?  Gentlemen, Merry Christmas.  You are correct.  James Buchanan.  We're all about this James Buchanan.  James Buchanan.  It's a safe bet that we already had a gay president. 
[02:15:30]  James Blue Cannon.  Cannon was a good friend of his favorite show.  Thank you, Vinny, from Brooklyn.  Always a pleasure, sir.  Damn.  Anything else on Buchanan?  Merry Christmas, gentlemen.  Thank you.  All right, yeah, Merry Christmas to you, man.  All right, let's move on.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay, so the next president was Abe.  It's Lincoln.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  In person.  Boo!  Abe Lincoln. 
[02:16:00]  Too soon, Ant.  Well, how is it?  Yeah, it kind of is.  Got to wait 200 years.  You know, we have a phone call coming.  Oh, man.  Oh, geez.  He's actually going with a real answer.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, there were rumors about the Abe.  Who's next?  Andrew Johnson?  Nah.  Now we're talking like fucking...  Grant, no.  Ulysses S. Grant don't even go there.  He was all man.  I want to take a...  Now he's drunk.  I want to take a look at Ruth...  Rutherford B. 
[02:16:30]  Rutherford B.  B. Hayes.  No.  No, he's got the big beard.  He looks like fucking...  He looks like the old man from Home Alone that Macaulay Culkin was afraid of.  All right.  This exercise is kind of fun.  He does...  Hmm.  Actually, he kind of looks like sleeves.  Yeah, he's got a little sleeves.  Did you say sleeves?  If you said sleeves, we might have to...  La, la, la, la, la.  Going in the White House.  La, la, la.  Residence of Fag.  La, la, la.  Making my way to the Oval. 
[02:17:00]  La, la, la.  He got some in his beard now.  La, la, la, la.  Smells like a bleach now.  La, la, la, la.  Going to sit on another man's call-a-la-lock.  Call-a-la-lock.  Going to take it in my mouth and swallow-a-la-la-lo.  Very good news.  Mike from Baton Rouge.  Mike?  He's going all the way to Foxwoods for the big poker tournament.  Last time we talked to him...  Well, let me ask him.  Mike, last time we talked to you, how far were you away from Foxwoods? 
[02:17:30]  I was about 478, 80 miles.  Now, that was at 615 or so, right?  So we're kind of tracking your progress, Mike.  How far are you from Foxwoods for the big poker tournament happening with Anthony Comey  later today?  We are...  All right, back to the presence.  No.  No.  Garfield.  Yeah, James A. Garfield.  Nah, he's good.  Chester A. Arthur.  All right.  Nah, Chester A. Arthur's good, too. 
[02:18:00]  Why?  He's not gay.  Let's pop him up.  Nah.  He's got the big mutton chops and shit.  He looks like an old wolverine.  An old wolverine.  It's Logan in his later years.  Ah, shit.  Our presence really looks weird.  Grover Cleveland.  Nah.  Nah.  Not the Grover.  Benjamin Harrison.  Nah, he's another one with the big fucking beard.  Grover Cleveland again.  Nah.  William McKinley.  William McKinley. 
[02:18:30]  Nah, he looks like a banker.  Theodore Roosevelt.  No, Teddy Roosevelt.  Stop it.  Hell fucking no.  Don't even go there.  William Howard Taft.  I'm a little suspicious of this one.  Really?  No.  Because of the mustache?  Nah, look at him.  Diabetes.  Diabetes.  If you got the diabetes.  He does.  Wow.  Yeah, hell yeah.  Wilford Brimley.  All right.  We can move fast.  Woody Wilson.  Nah.  Woody Wilson was a frail little fuck.  Harding.  Nah.  Welfare cocksucker.  Coolidge. 
[02:19:00]  Nah.  Hoover.  Calvin Coolidge.  Hoover.  Hoover, maybe.  Yeah?  The Herbert?  Yeah.  Wow, they didn't figure out his portrait.  They made him look cross-eyed.  Damn, he does look weird.  I really should have photoshopped it.  I know that, dude.  There's a globe right there.  I know the world.  It's American history.  I see the globe right there.  There's a globe in his picture.  All right, let's roll.  Let's roll past this shit.  Yeah.  Truman.  Nah.  Truman.  No way.  He dropped the A-bomb. 
[02:19:30]  Dwight E.D.  Dwight Eisenhower.  No.  Dwight E.D.  General.  JFK.  Love the pussy.  LB.  Nah.  Lyndon Johnson.  No.  Tricky Dick Nixon.  Nah.  No.  Ford, no.  Carter, no.  Reagan, bite your fucking tongue.  George H.W., no.  Bill, no.  Clinton, never.  George W., no.  All right, we're done.  And then Barack Hussein Obama, who, well, we don't know.  I don't know yet.  He's not gay.  I don't know.  Don't even go there.  I don't know.  I just said I don't know. 
[02:20:00]  All right, why don't we, can we take a quick break before these guys call or what?  No, he's calling in two minutes.  I wouldn't, because he might be, uh.  Actually, we should.  Yeah, we should.  We got a lot of shit to do.  Yeah.  All right, real quick.  We got a million reads we got to figure out.  All right, how long, how long is the break?  Don't wait for a couple minutes.  It'll be a few minutes.  When we get back, we should have Gerald Blaine on the phone.  Stay there.  The O.B. Anthony Show on the Virus Series XM. 
[02:20:30]  This is heady music.  Yeah, it is.  We welcome to the show Gerald Blaine, JFK's Secret Service agent.  Good morning, Gerald.  Hello, sir. 
[02:21:00]  Jimmy's here.  Gerald.  We have the connection.  Ah, there we go.  Hi, Gerald.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show, sir.  Well, thank you.  Now, you have a book.  It's the Kennedy Detail, and very interesting.  Does this have a, is this tied in with the documentary I saw of the same name?  Yes, the documentary was presented after the book was written.  Right. 
[02:21:30]  The agents on the detail had never discussed the emotional impact of the assassination, and we had a reunion in Dallas in June of this year.  And we had eight agents there who we met, and the Discovery Channel program was based upon that reunion.  It was fascinating to see you guys together and discussing, like you said, the emotional side of this, because we've all heard the technical sides and, of course, the conspiracy theories. 
[02:22:00]  And to see you guys just as the human being aspect of this whole thing was really fascinating.  It's a side of the story that really has never been seen or talked about.  Well, that's true.  Right after the assassination, there was no trauma counseling, so everybody sort of swallowed their own emotional impact of the event and had to continue on with the new president. 
[02:22:30]  And nobody realized what long-range impact it would have on them.  We just never talked about the assassination at the former agents' meeting.  It was an off-limits subject, and so everybody, somebody suggested a reunion just to talk about it.  Right. 
[02:23:00]  Get it off your chest.  Was there, like, obviously, you guys are human beings, and when something like that happens, do you feel like we failed, or is there tremendous guilt,  or do you have to kind of go on with the knowledge that you cannot be 100% perfect when some nut decides he's going to do something like that?  Well, that's what we tried to relay in the book.  You know, when we were a very confident group, but a realistic group, and so, but, you know, there are not very many jobs you can be 100% failure at. 
[02:23:30]  And when you lose a president, you're 100% failure.  And that just sticks with you over the period of time.  Gerald, there's all these questions, too, like, you know, that, oh, Kennedy didn't ride.  I know he didn't want to ride with a bubble top.  I think he didn't want to be seen as weak or uncomfortable, especially in the South.  Could you guys have overridden him as his protector, or basically is it his word was final? 
[02:24:00]  No, his word was basically final.  I think, in most cases, the president's word is final.  What you try to do is to explain to them when they have a threat that it's probably time to, you know, to cover up.  But President Kennedy insisted that the top be off the car in a parade situation,  and that the only time they wanted a hard top on is the bubble top was in case it was raining or the wind was blowing 
[02:24:30]  and it might bust Mrs. Kennedy's hair.  Why did they take, and this is just a curiosity question, I'm not, I used to believe in a conspiracy, I no longer do.  Why did they take that final turn down that, you know, go past the Stemmons freeway, so I'm guessing down Elm.  Why did they decide to do that?  Well, because it's the only way you can get to the location of the next venue. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, okay.  If they had gone down Main Street, there's a barrier between the two areas that the car can't jump.  And so in order to go on the Stemmons freeway, you have to go that way, and it's still that way today.  Anybody that wants to get on the Stemmons freeway has to go that way.  Was there ever a moment, because I know, I think you were on the advance detail, you were not actually in Dallas at the moment, right? 
[02:25:30]  That's right.  I was in Austin when the assassination occurred.  I had conducted an advance in Tampa, Florida, and was supposed to go on to Dallas to help with the advance there.  But then one of the fellows was dating a brand of airline stewardess, and so he asked me if he could take that one, and I said yes. 
[02:26:00]  So I went to work on the midnight shift.  And we were in Fort Worth and left Fort Worth that morning, flew to Austin, and I'd been asleep for about five minutes when somebody banged on the door, said the boss was hit.  Was there ever, because there was one point where, after the Warren Commission, so many people doubted what happened, and they said at one point 80% of Americans felt, I guess because they had only gotten a one-sided explanation on the Zapruder film about the way, why it looked the way it looked. 
[02:26:30]  Was there ever a moment just as a person where you or any of the agents thought, like, well, maybe there was a conspiracy?  Was there ever a moment where you guys had your doubts?  Where we had our doubts about it being a conspiracy?  Yeah, meaning was there ever moments where you thought, like, maybe the Warren Coalition Commission, not even dishonest, but made a mistake or was wrong, and there was more than one gunman?  Well, when it first started, we had no idea what the story was. 
[02:27:00]  And you have to wait until everything is investigated and all the agents put their reports together, and, you know, you take the steps one by one before you draw your conclusion.  And based upon all the reports that we had to put together and all the reports we saw, and when the final Warren Commission report came out, the agents were satisfied that that was the case.  There's maybe a few out of doubt, but they made a couple of mistakes. 
[02:27:30]  They should have called the driver of the follow-up car and the shift leader of the follow-up car, because the follow-up car follows the president's car by about five feet.  And the driver of the follow-up car, and the driver of the follow-up car keeps his eye on that car at all times, because, you know, he doesn't want to make a slip-up if there's a sudden stop. 
[02:28:00]  Well, he saw all three bullets hit their mark, and so did Emery Roberts, the shift leader, saw them.  But they never called them.  I guess they felt they had enough evidence.  But that would have simplified a lot of things, especially, you know, the magic bullet and the rest of it.  The first shot was missed. 
[02:28:30]  Do you mean the first shot missed?  Governor Conley in the third shot was a fatal shot to the president.  Sir, I think I just, maybe, the first shot missed and actually hit the curb, and a piece of curb hit this guy James Tague in the cheek.  The two shots, do you mean the second and third shot?  That was, that's not, that is, in fact, I think a particle of the bullet may have hit the curb. 
[02:29:00]  But the shot, that, the first shot hit the president because Clint Hill was on the left running board, and when he heard the first explosion, his head turned around to look at the direction where it came, and he saw President Kennedy grasp at his throat and fall into Mrs. Kennedy's, towards Mrs. Kennedy.  I think, and I believe you, I certainly don't want to debate somebody in that line of work, but I think that the first shot, I think JFK and all of them heard and thought it was a car backfiring. 
[02:29:30]  I thought it was the second shot that hit Kennedy, and that's when he grabbed his throat.  And the reason the magic...  No, it was the first shot.  All right.  Well, we have a big, I think that you're mistaken, but I don't think you're being dishonored.  I think you're mistaken.  He knows the deal.  No, I think that the first one missed.  But I'm not a conspiracy.  Not now. 
[02:30:00]  I actually believe...  Yeah, mainly because the explosion went, and Clint immediately turned his head and saw the president put his hand to his throat.  Clint jumped off the car and started running and didn't even hear the second shot because he was so occupied in it.  And he arrived at the car too late because the third shot hit.  So that was the sequence of the bullets.  Wow. 
[02:30:30]  That's something I haven't heard before.  Yeah, I've honestly never heard that.  I've always been under the impression that the first shot, because they took, I believe it's in the National Archives, they took...  You watch the South Florida film at natural speed, not slowed down to try to create, you know, what could have happened, what might have happened, or some theory.  And you'll see that the president comes out from under the tree with his hands up to his throat. 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  And Clint is turning his head along with the other agents and sees those hands go up.  And that was the first shot.  Now, the second thing, and people sometimes don't read everything, and I read the entire Warren Report plus the volumes after.  The sixth floor of the book depository had planking. 
[02:31:30]  It didn't have a flooring.  It had planking, and it was used as a warehouse up there.  Lee Harvey Oswald built a sniper's nest on that floor.  And below him, on the fifth floor, there were three employees of the book depository that were watching the parade go by.  And suddenly, they heard an explosion, and they felt dust drop down on them in particles.  Then they heard a clink, the shell hitting the floor. 
[02:32:00]  The second shot, the same thing happened.  And they heard the explosion.  They felt the dust, and they heard the clink of the projectile.  And then the third shot, the same thing happened.  There were three shots fired in D.A. Plaza that day, and that was the sequence, and that was the location.  They were found by the investigators, marked with chalk in the outline, and submitted as evidence. 
[02:32:30]  Yes, and I think it was Oswald who did the shooting.  And again, the more I've read about it, the more I have gone against the conspiracy theorists and believe that it actually was just Lee Harvey Oswald, who was a better shot than anybody gave him credit for.  Especially, you know, Groton and all these conspiracy guys.  Oswald was a better shot.  But this is the first time I've ever heard.  Have you been to Dallas at the Sixth Floor Depository?  Yes, yeah, I've gone there the once. 
[02:33:00]  Okay, it was not a difficult shot.  Yeah.  And the operation of the rifle, Lee Harvey Oswald tried to shoot General Walker a few weeks or a month or so before President Kennedy came to Dallas, and he missed him with the rifle.  With that, Lee Harvey Oswald went out and practiced and practiced, and he came back. 
[02:33:30]  And it was not a difficult shot, because he had a sling to steady the rifle, and all he had to do with the direction of the Elm Street down to the two-way, he had the sling.  He didn't have to vary right or left.  It was either up or down.  And I think that he classified in the military, he was a sharpshooter, and then he classified as a marchman right before he left. 
[02:34:00]  So people didn't think he was a good shot, but he was.  And I think the ironic part is, had he not been killed, Marina Oswald never would have been forced or had to give up that information, because she still would have been married to her live husband.  So the Walker thing you're referring to, we probably never would have known about if he had not been killed, so it's better that he was.  And can I ask you a question now? Why would Oswald try to kill that one guy? Who was the guy again?  General Walker. Do you know the circumstances behind that?  But why would he try killing him, knowing that he wants to shoot the president? 
[02:34:30]  Because if he fucking killed...  I don't know, you know, just...  Crazy.  Lee Harvey Oswald wanted to be recognized for something.  Right.  He failed at everything that he'd done. He couldn't even be a good defector.  And so he takes a shot at a right-wing... General Walker was a National Guard general who was sort of a right-wing individual.  And then he turns around and shoots the president, who, you know, is not a right-winger in any means of the imagination. 
[02:35:00]  He just wanted recognition for something.  So, obviously, if he was successful, he would have got the recognition for shooting Walker and not President Kennedy.  And why didn't they catch him for that?  That's one of the bad strokes of the whole thing, that...  Right.  It wasn't President Kennedy's day. It was a terrible day.  Do you... Are you saying that all three... Because I've never heard this, and maybe it's my own...  All three bullets struck President Kennedy? 
[02:35:30]  The first bullet hit President Kennedy in the throat, there was some markings on the metal of the car, because when it came through, it didn't hit any bone structure.  It came right through the muscle in his back, and, you know, in the lower upper back, or the upper back, and then came out of his throat, and probably was on an upward thing, and hit the metal out there, and then just went on in the same trajectory. 
[02:36:00]  And the bullet was not in President Kennedy.  It just cut the hole through.  And then the second one hit Governor Connolly.  You can see in the car that Connolly is turned around after the first shot, trying to see the President, to see what happened, when all of a sudden he gets clunked by the second shot. 
[02:36:30]  And that was the sequence of it.  There's been a lot of controversy in it, but you have to say what bullet.  If the bullet that missed, you know, if you say it was a single bullet, then the first bullet hit President Kennedy, and then hit Connolly.  The second bullet would have hit the curb, but that wasn't the case, because those two fellows in the follow-up car saw each one of the bullets hit their mark. 
[02:37:00]  Okay, see, I've never heard that.  If I got to the curb, I don't know, but it was after it hit something.  Did any, and again, I'm asking you out of honest curiosity, did any medical, I know at Parkland Memorial they weren't 100% sure what happened,  because again, they were just trying to, I guess at one point, resuscitate the President.  Has any medical, I guess doctors or professionals, said that all three hit him? 
[02:37:30]  I was never aware of that.  Well, there was always controversy on it, but there's been analysis of the bullet fragments that were in the governor,  and of course there were fragments for the third shot, too, that hit him, and all of the fragments came from the rifle.  So it, you know, I guess it's one thing that could still be a mystery, but based upon the sight of the agents that were there on the ground, 
[02:38:00]  it was one, two, and three, JFK, Governor Connolly, and JFK.  Oh, and where was the first bullet found?  They did find it, but it wasn't, you said it wasn't in the President.  Where was it?  Well, that's what I'm stating.  After it came, hit the President, and went through, and, you know, it's hard to tell where the projectile went after that. 
[02:38:30]  It could have, you know, gone out to the curb over there, because it hit him back,  and the President, you know, is sitting almost as high as the front of the car, and, you know, in the front seat.  So if it went up the projected area, and, say, hit the metal of the car, it could have gone down and hit the curb.  But that's, you know, one of those questions. 
[02:39:00]  But, you know, whether it was one or the other, the rifle that fired it was the one that Oswald had.  Yeah, I think that he was the assassin.  I just never heard, this is the first time I've ever heard that actually three bullets hit Kennedy.  And the Secret Service that were with Kennedy on that day all say that they heard the shot come from behind them and above them.  So it really does kind of say, ah, one guy. 
[02:39:30]  And there are pictures on the grassy knoll, too, that show everybody looking back towards the book depository.  And, you know, all panic broke out about the time the second and the third shot came.  They were just heading for cover.  Couldn't quite comprehend what was going on.  How were you able to move on to Lyndon Johnson after JFK?  And how were you different with Johnson than you were with Kennedy? 
[02:40:00]  Well, we weren't different.  It was a different personality.  And we still had the same resources.  And it was just a matter of, my golly, we lost one.  We're sure not going to lose another one.  Yeah, now that must have been on your...  Hours of overtime increased.  You know, we averaged 60, probably about 70 hours a month overtime, for which it was gratis. 
[02:40:30]  We didn't get paid for that.  We made about $5,000 a year.  Righteous bucks.  And added up to about $1.80 an hour of working.  And that overtime, after you work 16, 17 hours a day, the only people you can unwind with are your buddies, your fellow agents.  Because, you know, you just don't talk with other people.  So we just, as a group, you know, just felt we'd really failed. 
[02:41:00]  And so we weren't going to fail again.  Did you think you were going to lose your job and not go on to Lyndon Johnson?  Was that ever on any of the agents' minds?  No, I don't.  What they were concerned about, the agents, they thought maybe the FBI might take over the protection.  But then the reality of that is that you wouldn't. 
[02:41:30]  That's like putting a palace guard in, and that's not really a healthy thing to do.  Right.  True.  We had, in 1963, we had about 330 agents.  We had 34 or 36 agents on the detail.  And then they had four or five agents with Mrs. Kennedy and the kids. 
[02:42:00]  So we only had enough agents to have about five agents around the president at any one time.  And that, today, they have 3,700 agents.  Yeah, that's...  They have a budget of $1.6 billion.  And yet, what we tried to say in the book is, you cannot be 100% sure.  Because, today, they have sniper rifles that are accurate with headshots at over a mile. 
[02:42:30]  And you have, now, the extreme radical, suicidal type of individuals who present, again, another problem.  So, you know, you always have that little gap that you can't answer.  And, now, it just seems like there is, they don't, a president doesn't mind being seen completely protected. 
[02:43:00]  Or, I don't think a lot of presidents would worry about, because, again, I know JFK didn't want to look a certain way in the South.  I think most presidents today wouldn't be concerned with the appearances.  Yeah, yeah, certainly not.  As opposed, because, like you said, there's so many new dangers to, you know, to assassinating a president with the high-powered stuff they have.  And there's so many places to hide things.  And, you know, it's a different world.  Didn't the House Assassinations Committee...  Well, it really is a different world, isn't it?  I just want to go back.  Didn't the House Assassinations Committee say there were multiple shooters at one point? 
[02:43:30]  The House Select Committee on Assassinations, whatever that was called.  Their conclusion, which I haven't read, has been apparently discredited, was an acoustic evidence.  The medical evidence didn't show anything new.  It was acoustic evidence, which was supposedly taken from a policeman's microphone.  And they said that there was a fourth shot fired.  And then...  That was later disproved.  Yes, it was.  I just want to know, because I know...  There was somebody somewhere else, so...  I know that was out there for a while.  It was like a mile away, actually. 
[02:44:00]  It wasn't the police officer's mic that they heard.  It was like they had mistakenly thought it was at the time of the assassination, but it wasn't.  Yeah, I, you know, it was one of those things that, let me comment about the, because of my concern with this, is that a conspiracy never lasts more than 60 days.  Any good investigator will tell you that.  It's been 47 years, and there's not been one solid piece of evidence that this was a conspiracy. 
[02:44:30]  But yet the theories come out, and when the theories got to the place, they were accusing the driver of turning around and shooting President Kennedy.  And if you look at the Zapruder film, it had been the driver, he'd have shot Mrs. Kennedy right in the back of the head, because her face was directly in front of the president's when the third shot hit him. 
[02:45:00]  Well, that's just idiocy, the conspiracy theorists.  They say he did it.  Well, that didn't happen.  And then they said that a fellow in the follow-up car manning the AR-15 rifle stood up and fell back, and the rifle went off and hit the president.  I shot Marvin in the face.  He later found a film that showed he wasn't even out of the seat all the way when the third shot hit.  And if he'd have been the one that shot the president, it would have gone right between Kenny O'Donnell and Dave Powers, the president's closest friend. 
[02:45:30]  And it would have had to go through the windshield of the follow-up car.  So that just didn't happen.  But yet the fellow that was accused of that thought it was so ridiculous he didn't do anything.  And then he started becoming concerned, because the public was starting to believe that was fact. 
[02:46:00]  So he went in, and the judge said, I'm sorry you missed the timing on this.  You should have filed before.  Well, then they re-released the book again in a paperback, and he opened up the suit again.  And the curator at the Dallas Museum showed the film to the publisher and so forth, and they finally realized that that couldn't have happened.  So the suit was settled. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, some of the conspiracy – anyone that thought the Secret Service was in on it was just idiotic.  There was a reflection.  I know the driver.  There's a reflection when he looks back.  You know, if you want to believe it, you go, oh, that looks – but if you look closer, it's a reflection of some sort.  But it's obviously – to think that that would happen, that the driver would turn around in the motorcade as opposed to the hotel.  Yeah.  It's just childish conspiracy theorists.  And all those guys were questioned, Jimmy?  Yeah, of course they were.  Was there a rumor that they were stripped naked or something? 
[02:47:00]  What, a strip search?  Was there a strip search?  There are a lot of people, if you go in on the Internet and start reading all the different theories.  See, what really concerns me about this is that that was the end of the Age of Innocence, because every president before President Kennedy had been assassinated by a lone individual.  Every individual since President Kennedy has been confronted or attempted assassination by a single individual. 
[02:47:30]  So, why does President Kennedy have to be a conspiracy?  You know, mainly because nobody wanted to believe that President Kennedy could die at the whim of one individual.  But our nation changed.  When I said the end of Age of Innocence, the nation changed, because when people started a conspiracy theory, they went after their enemy. 
[02:48:00]  It was either the right wing, the left wing, and the blacks, the whites, the CIA, Russia, Cuba.  You know, you take the person you dislike, and that's where the aim went.  And so today, right after that, Oliver Stone put out JFK.  Yeah.  And he took a component of all these theories and made a movie, and unfortunately, that has influenced our younger generation to this day. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, people think it's history.  Today, he had an article out, this was about a month ago, that 82% of the young between the ages of 18 and 29 believe it was a conspiracy.  Yeah, I guess because it's – Vincent Bugliosi wrote an amazing book about the assassination, and the point he raised in the beginning, which was such a great point, is of course people want to believe in conspiracy because conspiracy theorists have the more interesting story. 
[02:49:00]  It's a better story, and it's sadder that some lone nothing of a man like Oswald was changed American history so drastically.  It's kind of a – it's more attractive to think that it was this big government thing and that it couldn't have been stopped as opposed to just this one lump dirtbag, which is really what it was.  Well, you know, that's – that is what I believe really happened because, you know, today, the youth has no confidence in government. 
[02:49:30]  They suspect everything that comes up because history was going that way, and this concerns me because if something happened today to President Obama like that,  you know, I'm not sure this country would survive because of all the, you know, the past history over Kennedy's, could you imagine what it would be like if something happened today? 
[02:50:00]  Well, you kind of look at it, too. It's like the way government is now. Information has passed so quickly.  You can't keep real secrets anymore because of the Internet and because of texting and because of all these fast, immediate ways of the whole country knowing something it wants.  And a lot of times the government has kind of made their own case worse by little stupid things they cover up like – 9-11, we all know what happened. 
[02:50:30]  It was Muslim extremists. But then they classify certain things like the plane going towards the Pentagon.  There are certain photos, which I think clearly shows it's an aircraft.  Why do they classify something like a few frames of the plane about to hit the Pentagon?  I don't understand why they classify that. It's like they make themselves suspicious when they don't need to.  I'd say there are probably too many people in government. 
[02:51:00]  I like that. I like the way he thinks.  Do you know anything about, like, Oswald's tax records, why certain things are kept classified?  You know, I don't know. I didn't – I believe that most of the important documents are out.  I don't know that anything is classified by Oswald.  The Kennedy family wanted the medical parts, you know, kept secret for a period of time. 
[02:51:30]  I keep hearing, you know, there are millions of documents that the CIA has.  That's not true.  It's – they may have some programs that were back there, and they probably are so filed so far away that nobody knows where they are or what they are, whatever is left.  Because I believe all the documents in reality have been introduced that have an impact on President Kennedy.  And did you – I'm sorry, did you see – you saw Jackie after this? 
[02:52:00]  I'm sure you met with her again or talked to her again.  No, Clint Hill, and one of the, you know, problems that Clint had, he had a terrible time with the aftermath of the assassination.  He went with Jackie for a year after the assassination, so he not only had the trauma and the emotion of that –  He must have been called an asshole a lot that year.  But he had to mourn with the family, and he said that Mrs. Kennedy never really discussed the assassination with him. 
[02:52:30]  It was – between the two, it was a forbidden subject.  So he never got to say – not that he owed an apology, it happens, but I mean –  That'll do.  He never said he was – well, I guess not.  Well, why don't they just get a new detail?  Because that's uncomfortable for everybody involved, for Jackie O, and then, of course, the guy.  So you have reassigned – reassigned him. 
[02:53:00]  Well, I found going around the country, you know, I wrote about the agents, but I go around the country on book signing tours,  and Clint and I talk with the crowd, and I look out, and I see people break into tears.  And all of a sudden, this brings out the trauma that they were confronted with when they lost the president.  So it's kind of a national phenomenon. 
[02:53:30]  That's why the book seems to be going so well.  It's going great.  I want to interrupt, because I want to add to what you just said.  Obviously, it haunts you to this day.  And in what way does it haunt you?  Do you have nightmares, or – can you talk about that a little bit?  Pardon now?  Does it still – he was saying – it obviously haunts you to this day, the assassination.  Well, it concerned me. 
[02:54:00]  After I – I left the Secret Service in 64, after five years on the detail.  Yeah.  And I went to work for IBM, retired from there, and then worked for an oil company,  all in the security and development of law enforcement systems and so forth.  In working for the oil system, I was over in Algeria, while the fundamentalist war was going on,  and I saw people beheaded.  I've seen my share of bloodshed. 
[02:54:30]  I served in Korea.  And I had a lot of close calls myself.  But the one thing I could not resolve was President Kennedy's death.  It was such a waste that – so that's when I started, especially when I saw they were accusing the agents  who just loved President Kennedy, and that's – 
[02:55:00]  Preposterous to think that they would have been in on it.  Sure.  Do you – when you see a president's personal life that close up,  I'm sure you witness a lot of things that the public will never be privy to.  Oh, well, we have on our commission book, Worthy of Trust and Confidence.  And the guideline that every agent should operate on is that you do not discuss with anybody  the first family's life. 
[02:55:30]  And you try to give them total lead way in the evening.  So when they retire to their quarters, they have absolute privacy.  You know, what goes on is their business at that time.  And so every agent has that requirement to not talk about the first family.  What do you do – and this would be any agent with any president –  when you hear the first couple, whoever they are,  having some sort of an intensely personal argument or an uncomfortable moment, 
[02:56:00]  do you stay there because it is your job, or do you back out?  What is the protocol when something that's obviously personal between a couple is happening,  but yet you're still guarding the president?  What would you do?  Would you back out of that?  Well, you give lead way – you know, usually those arguments don't occur in front of an agent.  They probably save those to the evening because I never heard an argument between the president 
[02:56:30]  and the first lady and all the administrations that I served.  But, you know, I've heard stories since then, but not – you know, nothing like that.  It's their private life, and it remains that way.  If a president were to have indiscretions – you know, presidents are men, and they think like men, I'm sure. 
[02:57:00]  And an agent obviously has to be with the president because he's protecting him.  I mean, does the president, do you think, say anything to the agent, like, you know, keep this quiet,  or does he just kind of go on and live his life and assume that the agent will not say anything about things  that he should not say things about?  Well, the agent should not say things about it.  If a – you know, if a visitor comes in, somebody may have a suspicion as such, 
[02:57:30]  but, you know, they don't know because the president's in his quarters or he's in a hotel room  and there's never an agent in the hotel room and there's never an agent in the living quarters.  So, you know, it would be speculation, and speculation is not a thing that you talk about.  Is it harder for you if you get to know the people?  Do they recommend that when you're guarding presidents that you don't get to know them as well  because it may be harder to protect somebody that you don't like? 
[02:58:00]  No, that depends on the personality of the president.  President Eisenhower, who left office with about a 60%, 65% approval rating, never rode in an open-top car.  Of course, it was towards the end of his administration.  He didn't rush into crowds to shake hands with people because he didn't need to,  and he didn't have a narcissistic bone in his body. 
[02:58:30]  He was just a – he was a general, and we all admired the daylights out of him.  We probably had a 95% confidence factor.  When we took over President Kennedy, you know, it took some adjustment at first  because, you know, if you left the keys in the car, he's liable to go over and jump in and try to drive off.  Well, we worked through that, but, well, we were called agent by President Eisenhower. 
[02:59:00]  The first thing President Kennedy would do is come up and say, what's your name?  And so he'd ask your name, and a couple of weeks later he'd come by, how many children do you have?  What are their names?  And then, if he wasn't in an affair estate, he'd stop by the Post and start talking with you.  You know, we'd never seen that before.  But he also – his political style was to be with the people. 
[02:59:30]  And in a democracy, that seems to have been the trend ever since then.  You know, you've got to be out among the people, and that seems to be the way you win the presidency.  That exposure gave us probably a 70% confidence factor.  We knew the vulnerability was there.  We didn't have the resources and neither manpower or technology.  We were the pre-technology agents. 
[03:00:00]  We operated by hand signals.  We carried three-by-five cards of individuals that were indexed by geography and by name.  And we memorized those pictures, and that's why we wore sunglasses, so we could hide our eyes.  Because if you saw somebody in the crowd like that, then you used the hand signal, bang on the car.  So you wouldn't have to look right at them. 
[03:00:30]  Along that line.  And then the agents would – you'd give a signal, and the other agents would pick up on it.  If the individual looked like he was a threat, we'd tell the driver to get out of there.  So that was the way we operated.  No radios.  No equipment whatsoever.  Old school.  What do you think – I know we have to let you wrap soon, sir.  What do you think the Secret Service did wrong that day?  Well, could you repeat that one again? 
[03:01:00]  Sure, sure.  What do you think the Secret Service did wrong that day?  Taking into account that you just – you can't stop every human being who has a desire to kill another person.  What do you think the Secret Service could have done differently that day, which would have had different results?  I don't think we could have done anything.  I did the advance in Tampa, Florida, and I was the only agent that had a threat case in the area. 
[03:01:30]  And I had two threat cases.  There was a young man that was going through psychiatric problems.  And so I talked with the parents, and we had a field agent there to maintain surveillance.  The second individual had not only threatened President Kennedy, but he threatened the local mayor.  So he was in jail.  Those were the only two threats in the entire Southwest, and we only had a master list of about ten people which were of concern. 
[03:02:00]  And two of them were on at my location.  So I look at Dallas.  The fellow that did the advance there was the most thorough advance man that the organization had.  I mean, he triple-checked everything.  So the advance was done correctly.  We had no suspicions of anything other than, you know, Texas had a lot of political problems, but they were all Democrats. 
[03:02:30]  But they were either the right or the left of the party, and that created a problem.  And then you had some conservatives.  In Florida, we had pro-Castro and anti-Castro.  We didn't know what impact that would have, but it was something we had to look after.  We only had five people around, as I stated before, because the man in the front seat of the presidential limousine is almost helpless. 
[03:03:00]  We could not jump over the front seat and get to the back because there was a barrier there.  And then between he and the president was Governor Connolly and Mrs. Connolly.  So, you know, the agent in charge in the first car can do absolutely nothing.  The other agent's responsibility is to cover the president and evacuate him from the scene. 
[03:03:30]  And there was absolutely no time to do that.  Clint Hill was the only agent who saw the president, you know, after that hit.  And he took off immediately.  He had to run between the first and third shot.  The car went 85 feet.  The car was going about 11 miles an hour, which meant that Clint had to be running 15 miles an hour.  And he still didn't make the car by the third shot. 
[03:04:00]  So there was absolutely nothing anybody could have done.  Sir, were you one of the agents that interrogated Oswald?  No, none of the agents interrogated Oswald.  We had an inspector down there who observed the interrogation of Oswald.  And the two agents that did the advance in Dallas went down and they watched part of the interrogation.  And, you know, they just said he was an arrogant person. 
[03:04:30]  How do you feel about Jack Ruby?  Jack Ruby?  We were in Dallas.  Jim Lavelle, the officer that was handcuffed to Oswald when that happened, said that what Jack Ruby did,  Jack always carried a revolver with him because he took receipts from the club. 
[03:05:00]  And he was kind of a police character, always dressed in the hat and the suit.  And he just happened to be walking by the department about the time the transfer was to take place.  And a car drove up with one of the captains in it.  So the officer that was supposed to check the security went out in the street to stop traffic and direct him around.  When he did that, Jack Ruby just walked down the ramp. 
[03:05:30]  And he shot Oswald when he came out of the elevator.  And Lavelle said that Oswald didn't say a word.  Plus, Jack knew a lot of the cops, didn't he?  Ruby was friends with a lot of cops, so they wouldn't have been as alarmed seeing him go down anyway.  Well, he was a police character.  You know, he ran a strip joint and club.  Hubba hubba.  So everybody knew about him.  But he, we did have an agent that interrogated Ruby. 
[03:06:00]  And Ruby just did not want to see Mrs. Kennedy go through a trial and have to testify and so forth.  And he, you know, he cried the whole time about the death and the serious loss.  Well, Jim Lavelle, about two days later, transferred Ruby the same way that he did Oswald coming out of the elevator. 
[03:06:30]  And he told Jim Lavelle, he said, well, he said, I guess I really screwed up, didn't I?  And that's meaning that he got rid of his own vengeance.  And I think he just wanted a recognition of it, you know?  Yes.  We have to wrap up.  But he also didn't like the fact that, he didn't like the fact that I think somebody who had taken out an anti-Kennedy ad was Jewish. 
[03:07:00]  He didn't want Jews to be seen as weak or unsupportive.  There was something with that as well.  Yeah, that was of concern because, you know, you always have a concern, especially if President Kennedy was tied up in the Cold War the first three years.  He was down there, really, to push the civil rights because that's what he'd committed to.  So, you know, you were down in the South pushing on an issue where there had already been riots and problems. 
[03:07:30]  So, you know, there was concern.  Well, the book is called The Kennedy Detail.  And, General Blaine, thank you for calling today and giving us some time.  Yes, sir.  We appreciate that.
