<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a self-deprecating introduction acknowledging their controversial past and frequent FCC run-ins.  Immediately, technical difficulties plagued the online stream, causing it to loop endlessly, resulting in angry, profane messages from listeners.  The hosts then launched into a discussion of Gary Carter’s death, debating his Mets vs. Expos legacy and sharing anecdotes, including one host's experience installing Carter's pool.  A listener call and a tweet regarding Carter's last hit were also mentioned.

The conversation shifted to the suspension of Los Angeles radio hosts John and Ken for their comments about Whitney Houston. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton defended John and Ken, arguing their comments were factual, not hateful, focusing on the perceived distinction between "crack hoe" and "crack whore." This sparked a broader discussion about self-censorship in mainstream media and the hosts’ own experiences with suspensions and strategic apologies.  A heated exchange with a caller, Adrian from Brooklyn, followed, focusing on crime statistics, racial disparities, and accusations of racism against Anthony.  The segment also briefly touched upon Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy and a viral video featuring an Opie and Anthony shirt.

The show continued with speculation about an impending conflict involving Iran, Israel, and the US, punctuated with profanity.  A caller, Craig from Brooklyn, criticized Anthony's racial humor, leading to a lengthy, inflammatory discussion about the lasting effects of slavery and featuring racial slurs and controversial statements from Anthony. This was followed by a comedic bit featuring "Wants to Behave" and a song with explicit lyrics.  Another tribute to Gary Carter included a caller, Bobo, a self-proclaimed Mets expert, whose interview was punctuated by the hosts coaching him to feign greater emotion. A news report misidentifying Carter as a pitcher was played for comedic effect.

The discussion then moved to the 2012 Republican primaries, focusing on Mitt Romney and Chris Christie's potential veto of gay marriage.  The hosts found a joke about aspirin as contraception, told by a Santorum campaign staffer, hilarious and replayed it repeatedly.  They then discussed various comedians—Chris Rock, Bill Hicks, George Carlin, and Jim Jefferies—before transitioning into a studio interview with Jim Jefferies.  Their conversation with Jefferies covered his career, including an FX pilot, experiences in the UK, and a humorous anecdote involving Russell Brand and the granddaughter of Manuel from *Fawlty Towers*. The interview contained numerous sexually suggestive topics and anecdotes.

The Jefferies interview continued into a second segment, beginning with a discussion on the differences between past and modern dating, with Jefferies sharing anecdotes about alcohol, his changing relationship with drinking, and comments about Adele.  The hosts and Jefferies made crass jokes about Whitney Houston's death and criticized Nancy Grace's reporting, then discussed Robin Gibb's declining health with graphic descriptions.  The conversation meandered through procuring prostitutes, Australian massage parlors, and religious views in Australia.  A significant portion focused on Jefferies' hoarder mother, including graphic details about their childhood home and her reaction to his birth.  They discussed inventions like wheeled suitcases and indoor plumbing, and Jefferies promoted his upcoming shows. The segment concluded with a Black History Month joke about Herman Cain and an Andrew Dice Clay commercial.

A final segment with Jefferies covered his weight gain after a film role, his family's history of obesity, and his mother's recent hospitalization. He discussed his dating experiences, his perception of his looks in Hollywood casting, and a caller, Simon, from Australia, shared anecdotes about Australian culture.  A Bruce Springsteen ticket giveaway with a caller, Roland, known for his extreme fandom and difficult trivia questions, ensued.  The segment concluded with discussions about Roland's lifestyle, an anonymous Valentine, the hosts' experiences losing their virginity, and the double standard in treating male and female teachers accused of sexual misconduct.  The after-show touched on Sam Roberts' absence and WrestleMania press coverage, detailing Roland's exploits, including an early morning buffet.

The after-show focused on Roland's lifestyle and health risks, comparing his alcohol consumption to Eric's past experiences. It included reminiscing about past show events, listener calls critical of Sam Roberts, news about a potential Ron and Fez split, Bobo's tweet about a difficult on-air conversation, memories of arcade games, and the WrestleMania press conference.  The hosts discussed their experiences with wrestlers, including Scott Hall, and the ESPN piece about his struggles.  The show concluded with a lengthy discussion about nostalgia for arcade games and shout-outs to Bobby Kelly and social media.

[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:00]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:03:00]  The out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans. 
[00:03:30]  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic, an alcoholic, and Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the O.P. and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then gets very uncomfortable. 
[00:04:00]  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructed show.  You're the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, you're 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:04:30]  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:00]  I'm typing down here.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Friday morning.  Friday morning, good morning.  I got a Friday morning.  Friday morning.  Friday morning.  Well, speaking of our greeter, you know how Walmart has their greeters? 
[00:05:30]  We have a greeter in the morning.  A goddamn greeter.  Yeah, it's our good morning guy.  Well, this morning I had to kind of covertly record him after I got off the elevator.  Oh, you got him?  Yeah.  I absolutely got him.  Because I don't think people believe that he actually does this.  Check.  Check.  I'm going to be checking my mic. 
[00:06:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Friday morning.  Friday morning.  Happy weekend as well.  That's him, man.  Wow.  I feel like I just met a celebrity.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Did you hear him?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Friday morning.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Friday morning.  Friday morning.  It's him.  That's great.  Listen up.  Listen up.  Isn't this great? 
[00:06:30]  Check.  Check.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Friday morning.  Friday morning.  Have a good weekend as well.  Have a good weekend.  Did you think that was great?  Have a good weekend as well.  Wow.  That's a new one.  Have a good weekend.  Yeah, I never got to have a good weekend.  I assumed by good morning, Friday morning, Friday morning, that I was to have a good weekend.  Sure. 
[00:07:00]  Can't use the instant feedback because everyone is saying their online feed is broken again.  Is this a best of?  Every single instant feedback spot is filled with the online feed is looping again.  Oh, boy.  It never fails.  What do you got? 
[00:07:30]  Huh?  Why?  I don't know.  But maybe not on the iPhone.  Now they're saying droids.  It's the Android app is broken again.  Keeps looping.  What do you got, Mars?  We good?  What?  Seems to be looping.  Well, let's hear it.  This is what Serious XM subscribers are hearing right now if they're trying to listen to the Opie and Anthony show online.  Yeah, that would affect you, right?  Yep.  Maybe.  Maybe.  But you would probably have a fine line.  Like, if you're straight, you're probably shaky.  This is Tom Papa.  He was on two days ago. 
[00:08:00]  This is what they're hearing right now, right?  If Mars stands there like this, can we just go home?  Yeah.  Who's that guy?  He's hilarious.  I like that guy.  He's my favorite.  That's what they're hearing right now instead of another live show.  Jesus.  Seriously, we've been at this a long time at this point.  It's not like it happens a lot, though.  Come on.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, really? 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  Did anyone get back to you guys about the online feed yesterday when we brought it up?  Yeah, they went ahead and called that company Quick Play.  At seven o'clock, it fixes itself.  I don't know for some reason, but they didn't give us a reason.  Oh, it fixes itself at seven.  Oh, that's good.  At least.  What does that even mean?  How does that happen?  I don't know.  There's so many people that want to hear the live show, but they're stuck listening to  some kind of loop right now.  Yes.  Again.  Yes.  Fuck you, Anthony.  And I can't even get a message to the people that this is happening to because they can't  hear what we're doing right now. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  My God.  What?  I don't know.  I was just reading, fuck you, Anthony.  You wop cunt.  Somebody wrote that on the instant feed.  See, because I never see the instant feedback anymore.  Right.  And I guess Travis is looking at it here, and it's popped up in a screen in front of me.  Wow.  And, eek.  This is what I do to that guy for you, sir.  You just fucking knock him down like, is it whack or whack?  Oh, whack-a-mole.  Yeah, you just whack-a-mole these fuckers.  They go away.  Whack-a-mole. 
[00:09:30]  These obsessed weirdos.  Oh, my goodness.  We got obsessed weirdos that don't like the show anymore, but they're going to  obsess about how much they hate it forever.  Instead of just moving on and going away, you're allowed to not like the show.  Believe me.  Yeah.  And you just go away.  The obsession part of it is what's strange.  It's that weird, like, you know, yeah, fuck you, you suck, you stink, this, that.  It's just odd, man.  Instead of dealing with those people, I'd rather worry about the online feed not working  for the people that still enjoy the show. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  God, what are they going to do?  Like, people are just not, they're not paying their bills.  They're like, fuck this, it's not working properly.  I'm not paying extra money to try to listen to you guys online if I can't get a feed that  works on a regular basis.  I've read the tweeters from people that have said that they're fed up with it.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's a good strategy.  Oh, my God.  We're losing geek stuff OG today.  He's pissed.  Oh, good.  App feed is looping worst of again.  These guys are going to give up. 
[00:10:30]  Does the company understand this?  I don't think they do.  No, they don't.  You know, I download podcasts.  It's easy, right?  I listen to other shit online.  I never get a loop of something like this.  I never get a loop.  Never.  I never get a loop.  You get what you try to get, right?  They got the technology figured out.  Occasionally, a page won't load or, you know, you just, you know, you hit it again.  Right.  Reload it. 
[00:11:00]  But this is just a bizarre thing.  Is that stupid ass Scott Greenstein on this?  Oh, boy.  Is he or is he too busy just meeting celebrities in his office?  There's real issues around here, idiot.  We got an online feed that doesn't work.  Has it hit your desk yet?  Fuck.  Let's go.  Oh, apparently Gary is, and this is in quotation marks.  Yeah.  On it.  Oh, really?  On it.  Today?  Yeah.  Danny Ross.  He's on it.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Was he on it two days ago?  Yes.  And he's on it again today?  Yes.  Was he on it last year?  Yeah.  Because this has just been something that's been happening for years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Literally years.  Is this the comedy one, Danny?  The Romney thing?  Yes.  Oh, great.  Is it good?  Cool.  What a tool.  All right.  We're moving on.  They'll figure out the app eventually.  Oh, don't worry about it.  I can't even tell the people that we're on it because they can't listen right now because 
[00:12:00]  their app is looping.  Right.  So maybe you guys can get the word out to those people that are stuck in loop land.  You know what the good part is, though?  They'll hear it in two days.  Oh, that's true.  They'll be able to hear that everything will be okay soon.  That's true.  We're broadcasting from the future.  Yes.  Hello.  Hello, the future.  How are you?  You will get this future message.  Do you hear this loop?  It's from the future.  This was two days ago.  Oh, wait.  It's from the past.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Yeah, that guy, Kevin.  You're right.  The I got it guy doesn't get much. 
[00:12:30]  He got it.  I can't trust him for shit.  God, if I was the programmer of the entire company, I think I would be fucking crushing skulls  at this point about the online feed.  Wrapping some heads.  Fuck, yeah.  Banging some heads together.  That guy don't got shit.  That's what I say today.  Gary Carter.  Fuck.  Oh, boy.  Dude, big Mets fan from back in the day.  1986.  Let's talk about this.  I tweeted Mets great Gary Carter, and then, of course, all the Canadians had to get involved 
[00:13:00]  because he was an expo for a while there, too.  Yeah, but come on.  Everybody remembers him as a Met.  And then people are asking me, you know, Mets or Expos with Gary Carter?  Mets, obviously.  Come on.  Has to be Mets.  What did he do for the Expos?  I don't even know.  Anyone that was wearing a Met uniform during the 86 World Series is a Met to me.  Yeah.  That's a Met.  Forever.  Forever.  Forever.  It's one of those things that's frozen in time. 
[00:13:30]  You're right.  Sometimes an athlete has, he could be on a team for a year.  Right.  But if he's on the team for that special year, he's frozen in time as a member of that organization.  Yep.  And know what's weird about the 86 Mets?  He's the first to go.  I know, right?  You hear how my voice went?  Yeah.  The 86 Mets had some fucking, fucking problems.  You would have thought like...  Well, I don't even know if I want to mention Ames, but to think Gary Carter, the kid, was 
[00:14:00]  the first to go, that's just crazy.  It really is.  That's crazy.  What did he do for the Expos, Travis?  You know baseball.  He did a lot for the Expos.  He's in the Hall of Fame as an Expo.  That's bullshit.  But it's like...  Did he win a World Series with them?  No, the Expos...  Of course not.  They made the playoffs once, and he was on that team.  This is how pathetic I am.  I don't know anything about Gary Carter as an Expo.  Who does?  I couldn't tell you anything.  Canadians do.  A lot of people do.  Huh?  Canadians!  He was on a great Expo team with Andre Dawson.  Stop!  But they didn't win anything. 
[00:14:30]  No.  Gary Carter won a World Series with the Mets.  Good for the Mets.  You're a Canadian cuck.  No, I'm not a baseball fan.  We are out of the loop for now, sir.  We're out of the loop for now, sir.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Thank you, sir.  Good morning.  Thank you very much, sir.  Welcome aboard.  Out of the loop.  Good morning.  Three consecutive Golden Glove.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Friday morning.  Friday morning. 
[00:15:00]  Friday morning.  We'll be there as well.  Friday morning.  What were you saying, Danny?  I'm sorry.  Gary Carter on the Expos.  Three consecutive Golden Glove Awards.  Not Globe, like I had previously said.  I mean, the guy who played ten years for the Expos and went five for the Mets?  Yeah, but the five at the Mets was way more important than the ten with the Expos.  Well, he had one season where they won.  It's the 86 Mets.  Everyone at the Mets said.  It doesn't matter.  It's the 86 Mets.  It could have just been shit for all the other years with the Mets, but that one fucking... 
[00:15:30]  It's the Bill Buckner year.  Right.  Let's go.  I didn't even want to check this out.  In his first game as a Met on April 9 of 85, he hit a 10th inning walk-off home run to give the Mets a 6-5 opening day victory.  That's awesome.  He was a great guy.  That was his first day as a Met.  First walk-off homer.  It's a very rare case where he was kind of like the heart and soul of two franchises.  He was the heart and soul of the Mets.  The Mets.  No, I know, but I'm saying like... 
[00:16:00]  You can talk for another 10 minutes.  I'm not going to listen.  Mets.  But if...  M-E-T-S Mets.  If...  Meet the Mets.  When Joe Montana dies.  Greet the Mets.  Step right up and...  Meet the Mets again?  I don't know.  Something.  I don't know.  It's ridiculous.  Like when Joe Montana dies, Kansas City's not going to be in mourning, you know?  Yeah, but...  But like they are in Montreal and in New York.  But the Expos, they don't even have a baseball team anymore.  No, they sure don't.  That's how much they cared about Gary Carter. 
[00:16:30]  They got rid of their whole baseball team.  Right.  Terrible.  It really is an awful stadium.  How do you lose your baseball team?  I never understood that.  That's pretty tragic.  Baseball.  There's too many.  I have such colorful uniforms.  I understand how you can lose a basketball team in your city, but not baseball.  How do you lose your baseball team?  A lot of teams should lose their baseball team.  Why?  Because people don't go to games.  Why?  Because they don't care.  They should just take sports out of Florida. 
[00:17:00]  It's too warm for people to sit there.  Yeah.  They just don't want to sit around when it's really nice out.  Even when Tampa Bay, even when they make the playoffs, they can't sell like early round  playoff games.  Right.  They can't sell them out.  Yeah.  By the way, a lot of you people need this.  It's at S-X-M underscore help.  So every time that fucking feed goes down, you tell them because I don't know what else  to do for you people.  S-X-M underscore help.  Yeah.  On Twitter, it's S-X-M underscore help. 
[00:17:30]  Okay?  Right.  Right those fuckers.  Because I don't know what else to do.  Right.  Because Greenstein doesn't listen to shit.  Come on.  He's too busy saying I got it, but he never gets it.  So Gary Carter dies of the cancer.  We were just talking about this a mere few weeks ago.  He had a bed and the doctors were shutting down.  They were basically saying, look, nothing else we could do.  And wow, that was a mere couple of weeks ago.  Yeah.  He had his final public appearance at the college.  Last week?  Was that only last week we were talking about that?  Wow. 
[00:18:00]  It didn't even look like the Gary Carter we know.  He looked terrible.  They could have painted his head like a baseball and let him be Mr. Met for a day.  Horrible.  Because it was just all swolly.  And when the final game at Shea Stadium, that was only two years ago, right?  Maybe three at this point.  Yeah, probably.  And he was totally fine still then.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, he was only diagnosed last year.  The cancer got him quick.  He got the bad cancer.  The real bad cancer.  Yeah.  Daryl Strawberry is still.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:30]  There was a few of them.  Oh.  Lenny Dykstra.  Lenny Dykstra.  Nails.  Good old nails.  Ah, yeah.  But Gary Carter, the kid, has to go first.  Really?  Oh.  Come on.  So a lot of people are really bummed out.  I heard Bobo.  I should have.  Do we have the call?  What call?  No.  It was Bobo.  You didn't hear?  That was Bobo?  Oh, yeah.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Bobo called.  I don't think it was the fan.  Oh, no.  There's a few sports.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Hold on.  Let me.  Hold on a minute.  See, I can't get it because everyone is clogging the instant feedback with online problems.  Oh, great.  Just clogging it.  But he called, I don't know.  I think it was the MLB network.  Is that possible?  Yeah, I think it is.  Something like that, right?  On radio?  In New York?  Yeah.  And he had a rambling call about Gary Carter that went nowhere and the host didn't know 
[00:19:30]  what to do.  He didn't know what to do.  That's hilarious.  And if someone could find this fucking call, I would greatly appreciate it.  It was on the fan or it was on?  I don't know.  I thought someone said MLB network if that's possible.  I mean, that would be television.  So maybe called into a...  I can't YouTube Bobo.  I know.  I know.  So much is going to come up.  But maybe, maybe someone just happened to get it.  I wanted to get him on the phone because he was a big Gary Carter fan.  Well, we should.  Today, you know, Facebooked him. 
[00:20:00]  Today, we really should get Bobo on.  I have...  Because he's a massive Mets fan.  He would have a lot to say about Gary Carter's passing.  Indeed.  There was MLB...  Because I felt that was the station to call and take about my memory of Gary with two  R's, Carter.  What?  Wait, read that again.  This is his tweet.  I called into MLB network radio because I felt that was the station to call and take about  my memory of Gary, two R's, Carter. 
[00:20:30]  I need to hear that.  I really want to hear that.  Yeah.  Let me see if I can find it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I think they're on Sirius, right?  I tweeted Gary Carter's last hit.  Yeah.  Did you see that?  His last hit in the majors?  Wow.  Yeah.  That was for the Expos, obviously.  Oh, yes.  The Expos.  Very important.  This one's at the Expos.  This one bums me out a little more than fucking Whitney Houston.  I got to tell you.  Gary Carter's a good guy.  This one bums me out a bit more.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Good guy.  This is one of those not fair situations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And when I was a pool dude, I'll say it again, I installed his in-the-ground pool at his house  when I was working for a pool company.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Up there in some hoity-toity area of Nassau County.  Oh, that's right.  Little did I know.  You would live there.  Ah.  How weird is that?  It's very weird.  I was filthy digging holes and fucking gunite all over me. 
[00:21:30]  And it was Gary Carter.  And Gary Carter came out and he was like, hey, hi, guys.  Hey.  And I'm like, holy shit.  This is the fucking, the fucking guy.  No one really had a bad thing to say about the guy.  No.  Only the good die young, Ant.  Only the good die young.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Only the good die young.  Gary Carter is in the Hall of Fame as half an Expo and half a Met.  How does that happen?  Was Travis wrong?  How does the... 
[00:22:00]  Travis is saying no.  He's adamantly saying no.  Wrong?  Vehemently denying.  Speaking of Whitney, we got, this just has to stop.  It really just has to stop.  Oh, man.  Every fucking day we have another story.  This has to stop.  Two fucking guys.  I don't even know if they do a good radio show.  I don't even give a fuck if they do a good radio show.  I don't give a fuck if they're the cheesiest guys on radio.  But this shit has to stop.  It has to stop with radio. 
[00:22:30]  It has to stop with Twitter.  It just has to stop.  It has to stop with the TV hosts.  You should be able to say whatever the fuck you want.  Right.  It's out of control.  Especially if there's no hate behind it.  There was nothing wrong with what these two guys said.  Right.  Nothing wrong with it.  Someone's tweeting going, well, they should have been suspended just because of the hack,  you know, thing they said on the air.  I'm like, whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I don't care.  I'm talking about the bit itself.  L.A. radio host suspended for Houston Comets.  When you, uh, did you get like a rush of adrenaline when you read that at first on the news or Twitter? 
[00:23:00]  Where did you first read that?  I got like this, like, ah, what did we do?  Where did I read it?  Twitter.  Yeah.  Twitter's way ahead of the news.  Yeah.  Way the fuck ahead.  But I got this feeling like it was us.  Oh, really?  I got like, ah, like, wow, what did we do?  I thought we were fucked.  Well, even when I, people are just dumb because even when I tweeted a couple little, uh, things  about this, people thought we got suspended.  So you're right. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  I'm like, no, will you read this?  It's John and Ken.  Hey, John and Ken.  Good old John and Ken.  I don't know.  I don't even know if they sound like that.  They probably do.  Do they have radio voices?  Hey, John and Ken.  They're AM guys.  Are they AM guys?  It's KFI out there in LA.  Hey, John.  I'm like, sir.  I'm going to go with you, sir.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  Oh, we're going in the tunnel.  They should just get rid of the AM band. 
[00:24:00]  What is it worth?  Give it to the foreigners.  Stop.  Let them fool around with it.  Yeah.  You know that, you know, there's a trend in regular radio where, you know, sports talk  is going to the FMs.  Yeah.  And you know what the real reason is for that?  So they can play their intro music and make it sound good?  Huh?  So they can play their intro music and make it sound good?  Very good.  No, the trend is simple.  The new generation coming up, people obviously younger than us, they never grew up with AM  radio.  No.  So that's why they don't listen to sports talk because they're like, I'm not listening 
[00:24:30]  to this shit.  Amplitude modulation.  They just know how bad it sounds.  It's terrible.  And they're finding if they move the sports talk to the FMs, they're getting a much younger  demo.  Yeah.  Isn't that strange?  I cannot fucking deal with any type of music on AM radio where not listening to music on  it, but whenever a commercial comes on, like I listen to 10, 10 wins on the way in, get  on my news and shit, get my news on. 
[00:25:00]  And then they, they play commercial and there's music in the background.  It's so high pitchy and fucking like, it's literally chalk or nails on a chalkboard.  Yeah.  It's unlistenable.  I curse and, and hit the button to get away from it.  Well, let me ask you this with the internet and you're downloading, we're all downloading  music or podcasts or, or what not.  What not.  Why hasn't AM been able to figure out how to make their signal better?  That's a technical question. 
[00:25:30]  I think it, I would assume they would have tried.  I don't think it can.  You just can't, right?  I think it's what it is.  Simple.  It's just what it is.  You can't tweak it at all, huh?  No, it's just the nature of, uh, amplitude modulation.  I think that's why they tried that HD radio thing, but it didn't really take off too much.  Felt miserable.  Because you need a new hardware to, to, to, to get the signal.  Remember that shit?  It's terrible.  So, I don't know.  Uh, LA radio host, here's the story.  Suspended for Houston comments.  And I'll defend these guys every single fucking time. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't care if you're a, you're a hack radio team, you're cheesy.  I don't care if you're black, fucking, I don't care.  Yes.  You guys, you gotta, you gotta support all these guys.  The Los Angeles radio station has pulled two popular talk radio hosts off the air for comments they made about Whitney Houston.  Uh, KFI AM 640 suspended.  John and Ken, the hosts of the John and Ken gym.  Yeah.  For making insensitive and inappropriate comments about the late Whitney Houston.  It said in a statement Thursday, just when I start thinking, you know, Hey, terrestrial, you know, you do get that big audience. 
[00:26:30]  And that's the gateway to, I don't know, syndication stuff.  Like, like, like the old days when we used to do that.  What are you reading my mind?  I've been, I've been taking a peek on, you know what?  Fuck this satellite crap.  I want a big audience again.  But then, these guys can't even figure out online listening.  Why am I sitting around rotting here?  I'll go rot somewhere else.  But then this happens, something like this happens, and you're like, you know what? 
[00:27:00]  How fucking long would we be on it anyway?  Who knows?  To be honest, we'd be thrown off in fucking days.  Uh, management does not condone, support, or tolerate statements of this kind, the station says.  Of what kind?  They didn't say anything bad at all.  They were just fucking riffing about stupid Whitney Houston.  Yeah.  Everyone knew that stupid Whitney Houston.  Yep.  Was a fucking mess for close to 20 years.  A disaster.  And idiots out there, there's a difference between crack hoe and crack whore. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  You guys made the rules, not me.  Yep.  You throw the hoe around like, uh, like you throw the N-word around with the, uh, the GGA at the end.  It's different than the E-R, right?  Right.  Same thing with hoe and whore.  If you call someone a crack whore, you're basically saying they're having sex for crack.  Yeah.  But when you say crack hoe, you're just talking about someone that's a fucking mess.  That's a chick that, like, yeah, is, uh, kind of, uh, fucked up on the drugs.  So, to the idiots out there that were trying to beat me up on Twitter last night, there's a big fucking difference between the two. 
[00:28:00]  That's a wacky picture of those two.  Oh, boy.  Anthony, you got a picture like that.  I know.  What am I going to do?  When you were young and stupid.  Oh, you know, so impressionable.  Being a child of the 80s, you didn't know any better at the time.  I didn't know any better.  But we've moved on.  See, they know better.  That's the problem.  Exactly.  See, you guys could pull up dumb pictures of us from the past, but we learned.  You won't find a recent one.  No, you're not going to find a guy, a middle-aged man with a bullhorn.  You won't find a recent pick like that. 
[00:28:30]  According to audio posted online at urbaninformer.com, the host called the late singer a crack hoe and said she was cracked out for 20 years.  That, I would say, tomorrow on regular radio.  No fucking problem.  I was listening to an interview on Fox News, and they had some woman, and they were discussing Whitney Houston, and they said that her perception, the perception of Whitney Houston, early on in her career, up until everyone started getting news that she was doing a lot of drugs and shit, 
[00:29:00]  the perception of her, because of her music, was this sweet girl, you know, and with the angelic voice, and that perception lasted quite a while.  But the truth of the matter was, she wasn't that person.  She was a very troubled person, dealt with a lot of anxiety issues and shit like that, and was doing drugs, was doing drugs for fucking years doing drugs. 
[00:29:30]  Before Bobby Brown had started to come out.  Yes.  Because a lot of people like to blame Bobby Brown.  I think Bobby Brown put in overdrive.  Yeah.  He said, let's see what this shit can do.  Yeah, he hit the gas on that one.  But she was already riding this shit.  Yeah.  So, you know, to call her out, and for these jocks to say that.  You could say cracked out for 20 years, and you could absolutely say crack hoe.  Crack hoe, you could say it.  Because hoe is absolutely different than whore, if you really want to get into it.  It's not racist.  It's not fucking, it's the truth. 
[00:30:00]  Is this too close to.  What's the problem?  Is this too close to nappy-headed hoe, and that's why the management over there got pack-y?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Well, they, at least in Florida.  Grandma hair Don Imus got in trouble for that.  Me and Aunt.  That's grandma hair.  You got to go to Fox Business.  Me and Aunt were laughing at Imus' hair today.  It's not looking like General Custer.  Sometimes he comes in with General Custer hair, which is his, you know, his blonde locks, straight, like General Custer. 
[00:30:30]  Today, he absolutely has grandma hair.  A grandma perm.  It's like when grandma goes to the parlor to get her hair done, and if you feel it, it feels like a football helmet, because they put so much of that just wonderful hairspray in.  It has a, does it have a blue tint to it?  A blue tint.  He's got old Grammy hair.  It has that horrible old lady blonde in it.  Yeah.  You see those old ladies that have that hint of, like, yellow.  Yellow.  It's like fucking yellow.  You know what I love about it?  He's got maud hair. 
[00:31:00]  That one all the way to the right.  God damn you, right.  That's great, but look at the one that was all the way.  Oh, yeah.  That's Imus.  Down, down, yeah.  Down one.  That one's pretty good, too, though.  Right there.  Yeah, that's Imus.  There's Imus' hair today on fucking, on maud.  By the way, we're going to do at least 20 visual jokes today.  Yeah, yeah.  And we're going to do 20 visual jokes every single day, and maybe, just maybe, if you  wish upon a star, this company will realize that it's important to our show. 
[00:31:30]  I got it, I got it, I got it.  You don't got shit.  Use your imagination.  But it looks like Fox Business told Imus not to wear the cowboy hat anymore.  Is that what happened?  He's been going songs.  You know, Don, it pretty much alienates the portion of the audience.  Yeah.  That isn't a cowboy.  All right.  So, these guys out there in L.A. should have said this, right?  Yes. 
[00:32:00]  Let's see.  John said in a statement, he's John from John and Ken, obviously, said that he and Ken used  language that was inappropriate.  And they sincerely apologize.  They're listeners and to Houston's family.  Fake apology to save their jobs.  Fake apology.  And we've been there, so we're not even mocking that.  You know, they don't mean that whatsoever.  That's why all this is horseshit.  Because then the people that are offended go, oh, they apologize.  No, why don't you take it a little further and realize they're doing a fake apology.  It's insincere. 
[00:32:30]  The whole thing is bullshit.  They're saving their jobs.  We made a mistake and we accept the station's decision.  The host who broadcast the show weekday afternoons will return.  So, I think this is a Clear Channel station.  They, I guess they panicked.  The lawyers wrote that, by the way.  Clear Channel lawyers wrote that statement.  Oh, yeah.  They didn't even say that.  They just read it.  Next time we get in trouble, I want to write my own fucking apology statement.  Oh, that'd be great.  And it's going to probably be 30 minutes long. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  At least.  Ah.  Not some dumb, quick, short statement and then you have to hear us angrily fucking crumple  up the paper and throw it in the garbage.  Yes.  Yeah, I'm not doing that shit anymore.  Ugh.  So, they're back on Monday.  John and Ken often rail against taxes and illegal immigration.  Oh.  The National Hispanic Media Coalition, this, this, stop at the coalition.  Love a good coalition.  Said last year that it targeted the show's advertisers to urge them to stop backing the program.  And, of course, it's Clear Channel's problem if they're listening to this coalition. 
[00:33:30]  Coalition.  A temporary suspension is not enough, Alex Nogales.  President and CEO of NHMC said in a statement, how many times did John and Ken get to spew their  hate, apologize, and then do it again after taking off a long weekend?  KFI must permanently remove John and Ken from the air.  Los Angeles deserves better.  Shut the fuck up, Alex Nogales.  Does it deserve better? 
[00:34:00]  Is it bad?  What, what, why, why should they be silenced?  Right.  Boy, you just can't even say shit anymore.  It's amazing.  You know, this got people talking on Twitter last night and everyone says the same thing.  They just don't listen to regular radio anymore because it's, it's just robotic.  You know you're not going to hear anyone's real opinion about anything.  It's frightening.  Boy, sometimes you might say something a little edgy and a little crazy.  Off the cuff.  Yeah, something, you know, that you might hear your friends actually say.  You might hear actual human beings say.  Right. 
[00:34:30]  But no, they don't want that on radio.  God forbid.  Why, why do we all want just really just boring fucking entertainment?  This affects everybody.  It even affects Alex Nogales, whatever, whatever he enjoys.  Guess what?  That's going to be watered down too if we continue down this road.  Oh, yeah.  You want to hear the John and Ken thing?  I certainly do.  We got the audio here.  I know.  Cocaine, no, she didn't deny.  Yeah.  All right.  So she's cracked out for 20 years.  And we.  That is such a casual.  So she's cracked out for 20 years. 
[00:35:00]  So she's cracked out for 20 years.  Yeah.  Okay.  What's wrong with that?  What is wrong with that?  Nothing.  What is the problem?  You're, you're, you're, you're basically telling people she used to do crack.  I don't know what the problem is.  There's no problem.  We've all said cracked out.  Of course.  Heard about, you know, how obnoxious she was at these parties and she's doing handstands and she's  babbling like an idiot and running around and.  Wet hair.  Yeah.  She's a mess.  Mismatched clothes.  Yeah.  It's bag lady time.  Now, she's been doing this for 20 years. 
[00:35:30]  Blew through her money.  Ruined her voice.  I heard she blew through a hundred million dollars.  Oh, yeah.  She was, she was, she was, for practical purposes, broke.  You know, I'm sure there's always royalty money coming in, but.  Crack would have been cheaper.  So, how much of a pain in the ass do you think she was?  Can you imagine, you're Clive Davis and she has not been, she hasn't had her head screwed  on right for 20 years.  And at some point, you're just sick of it all.  And so is everybody else in the industry, all her friends and hangers on.  And just everybody who knew her had to deal with. 
[00:36:00]  It's like, oh, Jesus.  But you wait to put the tuxedo on.  Here comes the crack hoe again.  What's she going to do?  Oh, look at that.  She's doing handstands next to the pool.  Very good, crack hoe.  Nice.  But what?  After a while, everybody's exhausted.  And then you find out she's dead.  It's like, really?  Took this long?  I see absolutely nothing wrong with what they just did.  That was a very accurate depiction of what happened.  And it wasn't even cheesy, to be honest with you.  It wasn't cheesy.  It was just a good discussion about the situation.  It was a pretty good discussion.  Yeah, the guy had the situation down right there. 
[00:36:30]  In normal, this is the way people talk a language.  Right.  I'd get rid of that stupid hole.  But besides that, it was a fine little break on Whitney Houston.  And what a loser she became for the last 20 years.  Hearing the breaks come on, like right when she fucking...  And, you know, Whitney Houston, she's around the pool.  And, well, I...  Jam on the...  Jam on the breaks.  Yuck.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Why would these radio guys just accept the hole?  We never...  They tried over the years.  We said, no!  No.  Remember?  I know.  They want to bounce that shit out.  We're like, no thank you.  Better enough having Dr. Gay come in here every so often.  It's the closest we'll get, right?  Exactly.  So, this is pretty much a non-story that's getting a lot of heat.  Sorry, Alex Nogales.  You're not going to get your wish.  They're not going to take these guys off the air.  You asshole.  That's right.  I'm calling you an asshole.  Do you think? 
[00:37:30]  You know, what if the pressure continues when they return to their gig on Monday?  Let's think this over.  Nah.  Nah?  Nah, because in the end it wasn't that outrageous.  No, it wasn't.  Yeah, I don't see a big outcry.  Nah.  Calling for their firing.  You know what?  And, you know, they got some publicity.  I didn't know these guys until today.  Yeah, see?  Look at that.  So, in a way, Alex isn't wrong when you suspend somebody.  When me and Andrews get suspended, and it's been way too long at this point, we weren't 
[00:38:00]  bummed out.  We're like, wait, you're giving us Friday?  Oh, we got it, yeah.  You're giving us Friday off?  As long as we weren't fired, I was like, nice.  Yeah.  So, that's the only thing I agree with, with this dumb Alex Nogales.  Yeah, you're right.  And every suspension we've ever had, we never...  As long as you knew you were coming back, you didn't care.  And we never had an unpaid suspension.  All right, shh.  Oh, please, it's ancient history now. 
[00:38:30]  We were supposed to not get paid, remember?  Oh, I remember.  Remember Bruce Mittman, b-b-boys, we gotta sit you out a few days, let the heat come.  Yeah.  B-b-b-boys.  We're telling the press that we're not paying you, but of course you'll be getting your  paychecks.  Even the homeless Charlie thing, we got paid for that motherfucker.  Yep, that whole, what was it, a month?  Yeah, and they spun it that we were...  They weren't taking my fucking money.  Yeah, they spun it that we weren't getting paid for that one.  We got paid.  Yeah, we did.  So he's right, because a suspension means, oh, wait, you're not firing me? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  All right, I'm gonna go play golf for a few days.  Cool.  Unless it's a suspension pending the investigation.  That's bad, because that means fired, fired, so fired.  Of course.  Yeah.  But if they're saying, no, don't worry, we're gonna have you back on Monday or in a week.  Yeah, man.  Then you pat each other on the back, you trade the phone calls.  Hey, man, did you see the news?  And you start trading like fucking, hey, did you see that one?  Yeah.  Checking your Google alerts.  Think about it.  This is what the company does.  They take you off the air.  You're getting a shitload of press, because everyone's talking about it. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And they continue to pay you.  Yeah.  And you get to do whatever the fuck you want.  Now you're off.  As this press is building.  Paid vacation, you come back to a lot of hoopla.  So Alex and the Nogales, you're right, but tough shit.  Tough shit.  These guys will not be pulled from the airwaves.  I guarantee it.  No.  This is a guarantee.  And they shouldn't be.  But, nah, Clear Channel should have just, you know, not suspended him at all.  No.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:40:00]  Can we throw this shit away?  Yeah.  Put that in the shit.  Done with that.  There we go.  What happened to Bobo?  He can't wait around.  He's a big star now.  He was waiting all this time until he turned around and then he hung up.  That was it, right?  We'll get him back on.  Hold on.  Mr. Balutigans was needed some food.  We got a black guy, I guess because it's important to the discussion.  That's when they say this shit.  Adrian in Brooklyn.  What's up, buddy? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, I was just calling to say, man, from an African-American perspective, man, calling  Whitney Houston the crackhead, that's no big deal, man.  But more to the point, though, Anthony, how long have you been sucking cock for?  Let me think.  Black or white?  Obviously black.  You got a little...  Why you hate black so much?  You sound like a scorned black chick.  That's why I'm saying why you hate black.  Really?  I sound like a scorned black chick? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, does that mean I get to emasculate you like black women do to black men?  I get to emasculate you?  No.  Oh, what's the matter?  What?  What?  No, we doggone.  Oh, do you?  Do you?  Really?  Do you?  Do you?  Why don't you find yourself a fat-ass white woman and be the man in your neighborhood in  Brooklyn?  A fat-ass white woman?  Yeah, go ahead.  Find some big fat-ass bleach-blonde white woman to go put on your arm as the prize in  the community.  The prize.  Still with Heidi Klum.  Data ones with white woman vagina juice all over their face. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, still.  Okay, go through it.  I'll wait.  What's wrong?  What?  Go through it.  What's the matter?  You don't like when I blurt the truth out?  Is that a problem with you?  It's not politically correct enough?  You don't like looking in the mirror?  What's the matter?  Was it my tweet about first 48 being 98% black murders last night?  Was that it?  What got you?  What got you?  Dude, I'm trying to have a discussion with you.  What got you?  You didn't answer my question, though. 
[00:42:00]  I've never sucked a cock.  Okay, I'll answer.  I've never sucked cock, black, or white.  There, the answer.  Now you answer me.  What got you?  What'd he do to you?  What got you?  What'd he do to you?  No one did anything to me.  What got you?  What'd he do to you?  I'm answering you.  You're a fucking cunt.  I'm answering you.  What racist thing did I say that got to you, sir?  What racist thing?  Yeah, what racist thing did I say that got to you?  What racist thing?  Let me count the ways.  Well, how about one? 
[00:42:30]  Give me one.  What racist thing?  Yeah.  What do you mean, what racist thing?  You're the one that says, I hate black people.  You do hate black people.  I'm racist.  Because name something I said that got to you that I won't be able to.  Okay.  You say that crime disproportionately happens in the black community.  And it does.  Thank you.  No, no.  Yes, it does.  You dropped out of high school.  Let me explain general math to you.  There's 160, 170 million white people in America. 
[00:43:00]  There's 30 to 40 million black people.  Okay.  So if 2 million black people commit a crime and 6 million white people commit a crime, disproportionately, the percentage is higher in the black community.  But it doesn't mean that more black people are committing crimes.  I never said, I never said more black people.  Yes, the number.  No.  It's a disproportionate.  When I say disproportionate, it means percentage wise, you dumb motherfucker.  Right.  But it doesn't mean that more. 
[00:43:30]  No, no.  I didn't say more black people commit crimes than white people.  I said percentage wise, based on the percentage of population.  More white people are committing more crimes, though.  Of course.  Yes, I agree.  Don't say that.  I agree.  But why then is 50% of the prison population black when only 10 to 12% of the population is black in the country?  Because the scales of justice are not equal.  Ah, so they're not really doing the crimes?  Because the scales of justice are not equal.  Why is the homicide rate, uh... 
[00:44:00]  Because the scales of justice are not equal.  Really?  The scales of justice are not blind.  Really?  The black president, uh, and the scales of justice aren't, uh...  The justice system didn't elect Obama, you dummy.  No, what I'm saying is, your argument sucks dick.  Your argument sucks.  You know, you sit there, blame the white man, fucking...  Hang all your shit on racism and whitey.  And, and get nowhere. 
[00:44:30]  Stay in Crooklyn, motherfucker.  Yeah, good, good job.  Black cock.  Ah, here he goes again with the black cock.  I said, I haven't sucked any cock, white or black.  I answer your questions.  You don't answer mine.  You're a fucking joke.  You're a joke, motherfucker.  You're a burden.  You're a burden to your fucking people.  You're a burden.  Keep blaming white people.  Keep blaming white people.  Keep blaming white people and the criminal justice system. 
[00:45:00]  Take no responsibility.  Take no responsibility for the fact that there's a problem in your community that needs to be addressed.  When did you suck your first black cock?  Never suck black or white cock, sir.  How many times do I have to tell you?  What about Asian?  How many times?  Asian.  Okay, yeah, thanks, Sophie.  Oh, what about Asian?  You didn't mention Asian.  Well, let me tell you about the one time I was at Hong Kong Gardens.  We believe you with the black and the white, but what about the Asian?  I just called the act to tell you, man. 
[00:45:30]  Proportionally, percentage-wise, disproportionate numbers, percentage-wise, don't mean that blacks commit more crimes, man.  That was the whole point of my call, man.  Thank you.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  The man did not understand anything I said about disproportionate.  Disproportionate means proportional.  That's the whole point.  But I'm saying it doesn't even matter.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, Jesus.  But proportionate.  No, no.  Dude, you're not understanding me.  You're not understanding me. 
[00:46:00]  I never said more black people commit crimes more than white people.  No, I didn't.  The numbers don't figure.  I would never say that.  No, no.  I want you to listen, so maybe you guys can work this out.  That's all.  I would never.  Maybe you can work this shit out.  I would never say that because it's not true, and I know that.  Okay, cool.  I know that.  But I said percentage-wise.  When you have a 50%...  This motherfucker won't let Opie speak.  No, I want me to talk.  Yeah, I want an answer just to explain what he said, and then maybe you guys can work this shit out a little bit. 
[00:46:30]  No, I know the percentages are disproportionate.  That's what I said.  That's what Ant's trying to claim he said, sir.  I've always said that.  That doesn't mean that more blacks should commit more crimes.  I've never said that, motherfucker.  I've never said that.  Adrian, you got Anthony saying he never said that.  Never said.  That's a pretty good thing, okay?  Thanks, Opie and Antti.  Thanks, Opie.  Thanks, Opie and Antti.  Very good.  Very good.  Thank you.  You got him to say that to explain himself. 
[00:47:00]  Good.  Greg.  Sometimes you've got to listen.  Good.  Good.  Oh, boy.  A lot of people want to talk to the...  No, we can't.  We can't allow that.  I'm sorry.  No, we can't.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That was fucking ponderous.  Was it?  Yeah.  I love when people call me out for being a racist.  You know, we all have lots of fun jokes around here and everything.  But the truth of the matter is, I don't fucking blurt anything out that isn't backed up with facts and figures. 
[00:47:30]  Just stop already.  You don't like what I'm fucking saying?  Look it up.  Do some research and see if it's the truth or not.  Are your facts skewed a little bit, though?  No, they're not.  Okay.  People don't want to hear them.  And it's not politically correct to blurt them out.  But fuck, man.  All right.  We're going to break.  And when we get back, Bobo is going to talk about Gary Carter because he's a massive fucking mess.  It's a tough day for Bobo.  And then we got a moronic white guy on the phone.  See?  We're fair and balanced. 
[00:48:00]  We are fair and balanced.  Way more than fucking Fox News.  Well, speaking of that, I'm on Red Eye this evening.  So tune in.  Me and Joe DeRosa.  Damn, that's good.  I know.  It would be fun.  I've said no to those guys.  Maybe I should say yes.  You should go on.  It's a pisser.  It's a genuine pisser.  That's like getting an iPhone.  I'm not going to do it.  Oh.  I'm not going to do it.  Hey, can I make a plea to the Twitterverse, I guess it's called?  Please stop sending me the Michael Jordan, Jeremy Lin picture.  Oh, God.  Please.  I beg you.  Please.  And whoever came up with it, very clever. 
[00:48:30]  And I really laughed my balls off.  Basically, I forgot the caption, but it's Michael Jordan pulling away his Jeremy Lin mask to say, gotcha.  What?  I saw gotcha niggas.  Gotcha niggas.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Which is hilarious.  Yeah.  But I've gotten it probably a hundred times.  Yeah.  Please.  I've seen it.  Please.  I beg you.  There are so many things.  They just think they're the first people that are showing this to you.  Well, you get excited.  I understand that.  Oh, yeah.  But I've seen it by now. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, see, Ruck?  I know you probably ignore these, but once in a while, I reverse check your feeds.  Do you know how many times you get that video of the guy in the O&A shirt on the tractor pulling the carts with beer?  Dude, did you see this fan?  Dude, I got that so many fucking times.  And we've talked about the guy on the show.  It turns out the guy is a comic.  He's a huge fan of the show, and it's a setup.  He admitted it.  Yeah.  He does these things from time to time, and they look pretty real.  Yeah.  But it's not a real video, and the guy admitted to me, he wants to come on the show, matter of fact. 
[00:49:30]  Ah.  Supposedly, he has a few of them that have gone viral over the years.  Oh, God.  And it's hilarious.  It's still really funny, but we've gotten that video, too.  Yeah, we've gotten it.  Thank you very much.  We have talked about it on our show.  Thank you very much.  I haven't heard from that guy in a while, so maybe us talking about him today, he'll get a hold of me again, because I don't even know how to get a hold of him.  Ready to eat?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I want to talk about Romney a little bit. 
[00:50:00]  I know he worries you, Ant.  I know he worries you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's an alien.  And to allow Santorum to be this close and in some polls ahead shows that Romney's got big fucking problems to deal with.  Because how do you get a Santorum this close to you?  It's crazy, man.  Yeah, we could discuss.  And, yeah, it's an old clip, but I wanted to discuss because it came up again.  Yeah.  Romney talking about how he's a funny guy. 
[00:50:30]  His family members and his wife thinks he's a funny guy.  And he enjoys comedy.  Of course he does.  So then I think it was Wolf Blitzer asked him who he likes in comedy.  And his answer just says a lot, too.  These politicians, first of all, they can never think on their feet.  Boy, when they're asked a question about their own real personality, ask them about their policies and stuff.  Well, I believe – and they go to political speech where it's like, blah, blah, blah, blah, their fucking company line.  Ask them about anything in their personal life. 
[00:51:00]  Favorite baseball team.  What do you like to do on a weekend?  Comedians, comedy, what type of –  Movies, whatever.  They lose their fucking minds.  They're deer in headlights.  They can't be sincere for a second and just honestly tell you how they feel about something.  Because they're scared.  Their answer might make people go, wait, that means you're more of a liberal than I am.  It's going to alienate.  Well, that means you're this.  Yeah.  Oh, liberal or conservative.  That would even be something they might want to go, hey, you know, that's why I'm not answering it. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  But they're worried like, well, we can't have this baseball team's fans not vote for me.  Oh, yeah, true.  Or it's like, oh, well, people might not like that type of movie.  I ask you this.  How pathetic do you have to be to be a politician where you have to, like, give these weird answers that no one gets pissed off about and you never express your real opinion on anything?  It's just all vagueness.  We go back to Hillary Clinton, remember?  All of a sudden she was a Yankees fan, but then she was wearing the Cubs hat.  Yeah.  I think at one point she was wearing a Mets hat because the Mets and the Yankees were in the World Series. 
[00:52:00]  It's like, just pick a fucking team, you idiot.  No, she didn't want to alienate anybody.  That's for sure.  That's pathetic.  I think that is pathetic.  I think that's a pathetic way to go through life, especially public office.  Yeah.  Pathetic.  You need to be a politician that bad?  Yes, they do.  You can't answer basic questions?  Oh, there she is.  There you go.  Yankee hat and a Cubs hat.  Split screen.  And I know she went Mets for a minute there, too.  Is that the Mets hat?  No, that's her.  Oh, okay. 
[00:52:30]  Cubs hat.  That was still the Cubs hat from a distance.  She's a fucking mess, too.  God damn.  I saw her.  With everything that's going on.  Remember our Secretary of State that we've had in the past?  Whenever there was crises in the world, you always saw them in the news.  Like, America always took kind of this leadership role.  And I don't mean, you know, world police or going out bombing shit or anything.  But just the leadership role in negotiations and talking and, you know, diplomacy, foreign diplomacy. 
[00:53:00]  Kissinger is a prime example.  That guy was all over the place doing shit.  Hillary was at a, what was it?  Don't cut off women's clit fucking shit yesterday?  I don't know.  She was at a meeting of people that don't want women's clits cut off in various countries.  That's not a joke?  No, for real.  That's where she was.  That's where she was.  And meanwhile, like, the Middle East is ready to explode with Syria and fucking Iran. 
[00:53:30]  Israel's ready to bomb them.  Egypt's holding American hostages and still getting billions of dollars in aid from us.  And she's at some fucking, please don't chop off African clit meetings.  Because that's easy.  Right.  Politicians always take the easy way out.  They go after the soft targets always.  The famous, we'll say it again, the violent video game.  Bullshit.  Instead of real issues that affect, you know, their constituents.  She is an invisible Secretary of State. 
[00:54:00]  She's fucking invisible.  I like her with the long hair, though.  Yeah.  Are you digging that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm talking with people, man.  She is garusum.  What do you think?  Iran's going to fucking cause some major issues, huh?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  That's going down.  I'm really, I'm really seeing Israel bombing them.  Yeah, that's going down.  And that's going to cause some major shit.  That's going fucking down.  Yeah.  Israel will be dropping some bombs on Iran.  And if you don't think we're going to be involved in some way, shape, or form, you don't think 
[00:54:30]  a few of our AWACs are going to be high above that fucking scene.  You know.  We gots to.  Yeah.  We gots to.  That shit is going to happen sooner than later, I believe.  Thank God we got Obama because he could deal with foreign affairs right there.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to be great.  He's going to be bowing left, bowing right, bowing behind him.  What do I do?  What do I?  He's done all right on that front.  Nah. 
[00:55:00]  Well, you can send in a predator strike on somebody.  He's good at that.  I like that.  All right.  We got anything cool to play to break?  Yes, we do.  What do you got?  A little, based on that caller, a little bowling for behave.  Ah, one of my favorites.  We got another black guy that wants that ant, too.  Oh, really?  Ooh.  You want to rest or you want to go for round two?  I don't mind.  Right now?  Yeah, pop on.  We'll do a quickie.  Oh, boy.  We'll do a quickie.  I'm not going to.  You know, I've already gave my point.  I'm not going to do it again. 
[00:55:30]  I just want to hear from this.  Hey, Craig.  What's up, buddy?  Brooklyn.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I've been listening to you for since I've been in high school.  How old are you now?  How old are you now?  I'm 27.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you guys are old.  I was hoping 21.  Yeah.  He goes, yeah, you guys are old.  Yeah.  So, I've been listening since I've been a kid, and Anthony's racism has been like, it used  to be cute and funny, but now it's to the point where it's just like, Jesus, David Duke,  take it easy.  But I want to give Anthony a little quick history lesson. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  Do you remember when black people were slaves for the past 400 years and we weren't allowed  education?  For the past 400 years?  Really?  Up until today?  What happened?  Well, not a couple of years.  Past 400 years.  Don't make it sound like it was fucking, like, like from 400 years ago until yesterday.  Okay?  Well, Anthony, you do realize my great-great-grandfather was a slave, so that's not that far.  But he died a businessman.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  No, he got a slave.  Okay.  But, I mean, slavery is not that long ago. 
[00:56:30]  I mean, let's say that what was the civil rights movement about?  It was because white people refused to get black people their rights, and we were going  to take the country part.  Right.  So, we like to pretend that racism is not this real thing.  But, I mean, the Europeans have had their foot up our asses, I mean, forever.  Yeah.  We weren't allowed anything.  So, all right.  And then when they freed the slaves, they didn't really free us.  They let us loose.  They said, okay, we're not going to make you work for us for free, but you can work  for us if you want to keep your place on the plantation. 
[00:57:00]  So, they didn't beat us, but we still had to warrant that.  We weren't allowed education.  We weren't allowed.  We weren't allowed rights, really, up until, I don't know, 1965.  Was this yesterday, too?  So, Anthony, I mean, you should pick up a history book, my friend.  I don't think you...  You don't think I know the history of the United States and slavery?  You don't think I know that?  I knew everything you just told me, I knew.  What I'm saying is, things have changed drastically. 
[00:57:30]  What's the problem?  How does slavery affect you right now?  Slavery, I'm going to...  You know why...  Do you know why so many black people commit crimes?  It's because of the lasting effects of slavery.  Oh, is it?  They weren't allowed rights to education.  Is it?  So, there's no...  There's no...  Hold on.  Hold on.  I let you speak for quite a while there.  So, there's no concept in the black community of right and wrong because of slavery?  Is that what I'm led to believe? 
[00:58:00]  No, I didn't say that.  From what you said?  Well, what are you saying, then?  That slavery, the long-lasting effects of slavery, have made it so that blacks today commit a disproportionate amount of crime?  So, they have no concept of right and wrong.  It's because...  It's because it's...  This whole concept of...  Of...  Just being a person is very brand new to a lot of black people.  And you have to understand, just like Chris Rock said, you have black people and you have niggers.  And it's niggers that are running around doing all the problems. 
[00:58:30]  Black people...  I'm black.  I have a job.  I don't have kids.  I don't have any illegitimate kids, I should say.  Right.  I take care of my business, so the problem is with niggers, and trust me, as a black person, I would really like to educate niggers with a talk.  You know, they don't want to learn.  Well, that's all I want.  Well, I just...  See, we want the same thing.  You should make the distinction.  We want the same...  I do make the distinction.  How many times have I said on these very airwaves the words of the great Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King? 
[00:59:00]  I judge people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.  And a lot of times, that content stinks.  And when I judge them on the content of their character, I...  The effect of that is people thinking I'm basing it on the color of skin.  No!  Wrong-o.  People got to step up.  Will you admit there are a lot of black people doing the right thing out there?  Working hard, raising their families.  Fuck yes!  Of course! 
[00:59:30]  I see them in commercials every day.  Wonderful black people.  Teaching white people about insurance and headache fucking pills and fucking Gerber Life things and fucking alarm companies.  It's amazing.  There's plenty of great black people out there.  What about the black couple where the black guy was able to afford that nice restaurant when he's checking his sports scores?  I like that, too.  See?  I like the fact that the...  That wasn't a chicken shack.  That a black guy sees a white guy trimming his hedges and asks him what his number is for retirement. 
[01:00:00]  And the white guy pretty much just looks like a stark-raving lunatic.  Yet the black guy knows exactly what his future is going to be.  There you go.  There are plenty of great black people out there.  And like I said, the content of character is what is important to me.  Not the color of skin.  Those are the words of the great Dr. Reverend.  I'm going to go smoke a blunt.  You guys have been great.  What?  Did you just...  I love this guy.  All right, man.  Thanks.  I thought you were getting arrested.  You all right, Craig?  He's a... 
[01:00:30]  I think he had to go quick.  It's a stop and frisk.  It's a stop and frisk going on.  We got Bobo standing by.  The great Bobo, the Mets fan.  Yeah.  Wants to talk about Gary Carter.

[01:15:30]  Adrian thank you  How about you idiots  Go hey no  He was a catcher  You're not listening  How about somebody  Listen to somebody  On the local news  I've seen news  Studios  The way they work  I've been in them  Yeah  Oh boy  They don't even listen  To the person  That they throw it to  Really  No  They just look at a countdown  It comes back  They look at the floor producer  They see the  You know  Three two one thing  And then they go  Oh thank you  Thank you  They don't even pay attention  That's too bad  Oh yeah  She thinks Gary Carter  Was a great pitcher  Great pitcher

[01:16:30]  That he thinks  People want to hear  Right  That's what he's all about  It's just  I don't see any  Not an ounce of sincerity  In anything he says  He doesn't come off  Like a sincere person  That's really talking  It's like some  Pre-programmed thing  He's talking about  Michigan this morning  Or yesterday  And he's like  Yeah I love the  I love the Great Lakes  I just love them  I love the Great Lakes  You know the trees  Are the perfect height  Yeah  What?

[01:17:00]  About the car industry  And he goes  You show me a  You show me just  A part of a car  I'll tell you exactly  What kind of car it is  What car  Except for the Japanese ones  That's  That's  That is throwing me off  A little bit  He just does not  Come across as compelling  As fun  As a real person  It's all that  Political attitude  Very stiff  I think he's very  Uncomfortable in his  Own skin too  Yeah  Because I think he's  Just trying to  Portray something  That he's not I guess  Yeah  Which is no surprise 
[01:17:30]  Because all the  Politicians do this shit  But he's bad at it  He's bad right  He doesn't seem very good  At trying to even  Look sincere or anything  He's extremely  Uncomfortable  Yeah  If he didn't have  All that money  Behind him man  I think he would have  Been dead in the water  A long time ago  Yeah  The money is  Obviously propping  Him up to this point  You can't allow  Santorum  This might dump  Two cents  To get as close  As he's getting  To you  First of all  The guy is  Extremely green  And he's a lunatic  Some of the things  That guy thinks  I have my way 
[01:18:00]  Of rationalizing this now  Yeah  I've rationalized it  Because you know  Obama's going to be  Re-elected  It's certainly  Kyle  It looks that way  It's killing you  I understand  But it's going to happen  At this point  I would rather have  If Obama gets elected  I mean  A Republican  House and Senate  Right  Because you know  Then Obama really  Can't pull any  Shenanigans  And I think  I'd rather have that  Than a Republican  President  And a Democratic  House and Senate  So if we could  At least take that 
[01:18:30]  And have Obama  In charge  You know  In the White House  Then it wouldn't be  All that bad  So hopefully  It goes that way  Right  But man  This  This guy  Is just a stiff  And someone's going  Well Catherine in Queens  Romney's father  Was the governor  Of Michigan  I understand that  But at this point  Romney's claiming  I think five states  That he grew up in  Where did he grow up?  Where did you grow up sir?  He grew up in New Hampshire  Massachusetts  Florida  And Michigan 
[01:19:00]  I believe  Yeah  Catherine what do you got?  Oh that's all I've got  I just  I didn't think  That you guys knew that  Because you were saying  That he doesn't seem  To know much  About Michigan  But  I understand  He spent some time  In Michigan  And his father  Was the governor  Of Michigan  I do  I do know that much  But  But he's also  He's claiming  A lot of places  As  As his home  As his hometown  I haven't heard that  Oh my god  You haven't?  No  What?  He talks about  New Hampshire  And Massachusetts  And I think Florida 
[01:19:30]  Is in there  A little bit too  I think he made  His biggest impact  Obviously  In Massachusetts  Being the  The creator  Of Bing Capital  Which by the way  Has done  Wonderful  Amazing things  And  People don't realize it  It's everywhere  They look really  Are you a Romney supporter?  Um  I think I have to be  There's no way  I could support  Santorum  Or  Gingrich  Right  But  So I'd have to  Pull the lever for Romney  Just for that reason  But you hear what 
[01:20:00]  You hear how you're saying it  And you're speaking  For a lot of people  If  You know  I have to  Right  Not I want to  Like  Most people  Want a candidate  Where they go  Yeah  I want to pull the lever  For this guy  Yeah  Right  Most people are like  Well he's the  He's the best of what we got  So I have to  Right  That's  That's dangerous  He's one of those people  Unfortunately  That  Um  First of all  Like  Besides being capital  Governor  Of  You know  He like 
[01:20:30]  Uh  I think  Um  Oh boy  What was it  The  Park City, Utah  When we had the Olympics there  Like  He turned that whole situation around  It was a disaster  Like the guy is  Oh yeah  He's told people a million times about that  Oh yeah  Yeah  I think he also grew up in Utah  I think that's another state he's claiming  Incredibly uncharismatic  And that's why he comes off as robotic  But  I think that's also a shame  Why  We don't have better people  As candidates for office  Because  You may be really smart  And 
[01:21:00]  Um  Like I've worked with scientists  Who are brilliant  But they have no  They're just  Not communicators  Oh  No social skills  Right  And so I think that he's  That kind of person  Where he's like the  You know  He's super smart  But he's just not a  And  And unfortunately  That's probably why we don't have a lot of  Super smart politicians  Is that  Well  They're all personality  You know  And  I'm starting to believe  That people that  Really  Could be  Great politicians 
[01:21:30]  Don't  They just don't want to deal with the bullshit  Right  They just don't want to deal with the bullshit anymore  Or the hard stuff  And actually  Working and figuring out  What's going on with social security  Medicare  You know  All that stuff  That's going to be unpopular  But  Really hard to do  You know  But  What are you going to do  Alright Catherine  I'm talking to Chris Christie  What  Chris Christie  Chris Christie  Chris  Crispy  Cream  Christie  Yeah  Fuck  I think he's going to veto the gay marriage thing in Jersey  That Chris Christie 
[01:22:00]  Yeah  That's because he wants people to vote on it  And I actually kind of agree with that  You know  I hate that  Oh shit  You just fucking trumped my statement  But there's  There's that issue  That a lot of people are saying  That these things shouldn't be put to a public vote  Because  You know  Because they can't trust the masses  Well  Something with  You know  Your civil rights  Shouldn't be up for vote  For a vote  You know  It's not  It's not something that  Because in certain places in the country  Like they always bring this analogy up 
[01:22:30]  If you were to vote on slavery  Right  There would still be slavery  Right  If you left it to the masses  Yeah he's going to  We've had a real hard time with abortion  Because they didn't let people figure it out for themselves  And I think  And a lot of  A lot of court cases  You know  Whether it was  The Keeler decision  Yeah  Oh my god  You have  Way more intelligence than me  I'm going to try to hang in here though  Watch what I do  I think  It's all those things  With the courts  Making decisions for people  That have  Sure  So many people turned off 
[01:23:00]  Absolutely  And that  You know  Like  You know  People  You know  Like so many members of the Supreme Court  That you  Would never be able to make it  As a politician  Or  In business  And yet they're deciding  I don't know  Anyway  Yeah  That was good  Is Bobo back on the phone  Thank you Catherine  I really appreciate your  Phone call I guess  Okay  Alright  Have a good day  Catherine from Queens  First time  Calling the radio 
[01:23:30]  So you don't think  Christy should veto that shit  No  You know  Let the gays get married  Who gives a shit  Who gives a shit  I tweeted that he should be  Vetoing the dessert tray  Yeah  That's pretty good  Yeah  Vetoing the marriage bill  Here comes the dessert tray  It's  Oh wow  He's vetoing it  How about you start vetoing that shit  He's using his veto power  How about you veto the old tempura  To send it back  The deep fried shit  Yeah 
[01:24:00]  That's what you should be vetoing  You fat fuck  Oh boy  Look who's outside of Fox right now  What the tall guy  The Harlem Globetrotters  People don't understand how tall tiny is  Because the other guy that came in was 6'3  It is crazy  That's what  Flight time  Yeah  Flight time is on Fox News  The national thing  Not Fox and Friends  Wait Fox and Friends  Right  And flight time is 6'3  Crazy right  And he looks  Like really small  Next to the 7'8  Tiny guy 
[01:24:30]  That rapist  Oh wow  That's right  He's not  Who what  I thought I saw a rapist  On the screen  Oh no no  He was cleared of all charges  Of course he was  That's the other Fox though  That's local Fox  Of course he was  So we got Romney  Talking about his favorite  Comedians  Because it came out again  That  I think it's his wife  Going oh he's just  Oh you gotta know this Romney  He's just a funny guy  You know you just  We just hang out  He's hilarious  He's really funny  And he was asked about 
[01:25:00]  Comedy  By Wolf Blitzer  Yeah  Wolf had a situation  And he asked Mitt Romney  About it  In the situation room  Tell us something  That we may not know  About the governor  Well I think people  Don't appreciate  Actually his sense of humor  You  You either have  A sense of humor  You know  Or get out  You can't have  You know  They don't appreciate  His sense of humor  They don't appreciate  His lack of sense of humor  That he actually  Plays a lot of tricks  All the time 
[01:25:30]  And that he  He's actually  Laughs  Most of the time  I mean as  Soon as  You will turn  These cameras off  And we'll be there  He will be telling a joke  And we'll be laughing  We'll be sitting back  And telling jokes  So why can't he  Bring that to the  The cameras  Yeah  Why can't he  Because he  Doesn't have it  He  There's nothing to bring  He doesn't have  The it factor  No he doesn't  Have the it  He'll be  Sitting back  And telling jokes  You're saying 
[01:26:00]  He's a funny guy  He actually  Is a very funny guy  Because you know  The image  Governor  Very stiff  Very proper  And it's funny  How that is  And it's like  That may be  His public perception  But that is not  Who he is  Privately at all  Is she right  Yeah  Yeah  I mean  You know  I live for laughter  I mean  Anyone who says  I live for laughter  They're not funny people  Exactly  I live for laughter  We're lucky enough 
[01:26:30]  To be around  A lot of funny people  Holy shit  And I don't think  One of them  Has ever said  They live for laughter  I live for laughter  Dude  I live for laughter  Dude  It just doesn't  Fucking  No one says that  What a stiff  But you know  In debates  You get asked questions  You answer the questions  You don't tell jokes  And as a matter of fact  My sons are a little tired  Of my jokes  I actually like jokes 
[01:27:00]  As well as things  That are sort of fun  My sons like spontaneous humor  Not jokes  But I like it all  Anytime you can laugh  I mean I go back  I used to watch Laurel and Hardy  The Three Stooges  You know  Even the Keystone Cops  I mean I like old humor  I love Lucy  You just come up  Like that thing  That is true  I watched I Love Lucy  I watched The Honeymooners  I love humor  Ha ha ha  He mentioned shit  That's a hundred years old  Once again  The Keystone Cops  We hang out  With a lot of funny people 
[01:27:30]  And no one would ever admit  That they like Laurel and Hardy  I like Laurel and Hardy  You might  You might  I like the Keystone Cops  Right  I like what Fatty Arbuckle  Did with a Coke bottle  Yeah right  That was good  He pulled a woman's vagina out  I was telling you before the show  When we were discussing this  That when you discover comedy  Yeah  And usually at a very young age  Sure you go with  The Three Stooges  Laurel and Hardy  Keystone Cops  Because that's  That's like the seed of comedy  Right 
[01:28:00]  And then you gotta expand from there  And this Mitt Romney  I guess has never expanded from there  Like who's your favorite comic  He probably can't say  Because that would  That would say too much  Oh yeah  To potential voters  I love a good  Vaudevillian skit  Right  Something from Vaudeville  Right  I like a good mammy  Minstrel show  I like the Roadrunner  He's just not funny  And he has no concept  Of what people find funny  I think it's Jas 
[01:28:30]  J-A-S from Columbus  Just writes  Keystone Cops  How old is this guy?  No one watches  The Keystone Cops  I think it would take me  Close to an hour  To find a Keystone Cops clip  Where do you see that shit  At this point  Even with YouTube  Keystone  Yeah look  There's some Keystone Cops  What part do you like?  When they're all running  In fast motion  With their little billy clubs  Or when they  Give me a  When they have the Model T  And they go around  The corner real fast 
[01:29:00]  Let's go with Keystone Cops  Meet Pickles and Peppers  Oh  Ah  Look  We've spotted a Negro  Quick chase him  Alright we got the cops  They reported to  Oh he just fell down  That's hilarious  Why did he fall?  Romney's just laughing  His fucking ass off  At this shit  Look they're having a tug of war  With a fat guy  Wearing boxing gloves  And the one fat guy  Having a tug of war  The one fat guy 
[01:29:30]  Beat the six cops  In a tug of war  This is hilarious  Look it's Justin Volpe's  Great great grandfather  Shoving a plunger up  An ethnic guy's asshole  Oh my god  The cops were buffoons  I guess  Yeah the cops were  This was like  Real gangster shit  This was like  Fuck the police  Before you know  They had sound  Yeah  Those Keystone Cops  Were wacky 
[01:30:00]  Look see they run  And they always got  Their billy clubs out  Ready to rack  Some fucking head  Old school style  And now they're  Looking at  Obviously this guy's  Super Mario or something  Looks like Mario in there  In the room  Now they're in the courthouse  None of this makes sense  Oh god  They're all falling down  And Mitt Romney  Finds this funny  Uh yeah  That's stupid  Yeah  I enjoy that  Laurel Party  Keystone Cops  Uh huh  What was the other one  Oh Three Stooges 
[01:30:30]  Three Stooges  Yeah I'll watch  The Three Stooges  On the weekends  Sure  I like a good brass band  In a gazebo  Right  But if you asked me  About comedy  I would go Bill Hicks  I would go  Fucking George Carlin  Would be right the fuck up there  Yeah you know  No problem  Jimmy Norton  Jimmy Norton  In Atlanta  Jimmy Norton  At the punchline  Yeah  I wonder how the show  Went last night  I hope it went well  Yeah  Oh god  Good luck with that Ant  Well like I said  Good luck with that 
[01:31:00]  I really hope  At least we get  The Republican  House and Senate  So you know  Not too many shenanigans  I said this  All I really ask for  In my government  Is  Don't tax the fuck  Out of me  Which you're doing already  And leave my guns alone  Leave my guns alone  And you know  For the most part  Democrats and libs  They're the ones that like  Snatching away  Little gun rights  Here and there  Yeah  And enacting these rules  But my observation  You were a little 
[01:31:30]  I don't want to  I don't want to overstate this  But you were a bit more excited  About Romney  I would say  Three or four months ago  Oh yeah  And I see it just  As I sit with you every day  I just see it rotting away  In your soul  Well you know  When you hear clips like  The Keystone Cops  And Laurel and Hardy  Laurel and Hardy  Hey Mitt  How about some comedy  With sound  How about some comedy  With something other than  A ragtime 
[01:32:00]  Pianni  Being played behind it  Because it goes back  To our point earlier  Like that's  That's way too brave  Yeah  To actually you know  Mention a comic  That might be saying  Some stuff  Yeah  I enjoy  Andrew Dice Clay  Imagine  Face down  Asses up  Right  I like that one  Chris Rock  Yeah  I like the Chris Rock  Niggas bit  Right  That's hilarious  It's all bullshit  You know  I'd at least have more respect  For him if he said  Something like that  This is safe to say this 
[01:32:30]  Yeah  Way safe  I love that Louis bit  Where his daughter  Shits in her  Yeah  Own  Country  Yeah  Yeah when Louis  When Louis talks about  Cleaning shit  Out of his daughter's cunt  Hilarious  I was on the floor  With that one  I  I like a good  Video  And internet videos  Like  Two girls one cup  It's very funny  Tub girl  I laugh my ass up 
[01:33:00]  At tub girl  And nothing funnier  Than around the office  Putting a meat spin  On the computer  And seeing how many times  That dick  Flops around  Hello  Where'd everyone go  I feel bad for you  You had high hopes  For your  Republican candidate  But I see it in your face  You're like  You're trying to stay strong  And I know you'll still  Pull the lever for him  I know that  I have to  But you're in the  I have to  Portion of this 
[01:33:30]  I have to  I  I don't want to  You gotta do that  Me has to  But you  You wanted to  Want  Not have to  Uh huh  Hey one more thing  Before we move on  From politics  Maybe it's not right  To say this  Yeah  But when that old dude  I don't even know his name  Fucking uh  Talked about um  Birth control  With the aspirin  Between the girl's legs  In front of Andrea Mitchell  I fucking howled  So  Hilarious  It's hilarious  It's fucking hilarious  I laughed so fucking hard 
[01:34:00]  And Andrea Mitchell  Just had to sit there  Like  Gulping  Like  What  Do we have that clip  Yeah  Oh please  I hope we do  It's been played everywhere  It's uh  I  I  I forgot the guy's name  He  He works for Santorum  Right  Yeah  What does he do for Santorum  I'm not even sure  But you know  Everyone's saying  Look Santorum's gotta get on this  Immediately  Or he's gonna lose the  You know  The female vote  Yeah  My god  But I howled 
[01:34:30]  This guy's talking  Old school  Where  Where women just put  Aspirin  Between their legs  Yes  To take care of the problem  When they have hysteria  You have to manually stimulate them  Oh there he is  That's aspirin guy  You just had it  Aspirin  Yeah  You got aspirin  Hopefully this is the  Contraceptor thing  My gosh  It's so  It's such inexpensive  You know  Back in my days  They used bare aspirin  For contraceptives  The gals put it between their knees  And it wasn't that costly  Excuse me  I'm just trying to catch my breath 
[01:35:00]  From that  Mr. Freeze  Frankly  You haven't seen that clip  No I've seen it  I like  I like the  The just nothingness  That happens after he says it  He's smiling like a buffoon  And she's in  Utter and complete shock  No why he's smiling  He's like  I just did good there  I did good  In that position  Remember that  Look what I just said  It's good  It's a good statement  It wasn't called date rape  In our day  It was just called a date  What?  Hello?  Can someone help me out with that 
[01:35:30]  Is that based on something  That really used to go down?  Well it was  That  It's like  It was  That was kind of a joke  About contraception  Back in the old day  Right  You know  The mother would tell the daughter  To put that bare aspirin  Between your legs  And obviously it means  The girl can't spread her legs  So she can't have sex  And get pregnant  So what  So it's kind of a joke  But it's  So what is the problem?  Now it's considered  In very bad taste  Wait you've heard that before?  The aspirin thing?  Yeah  Yeah  Oh alright  So you're holding the aspirin 
[01:36:00]  Between your legs  So you're not opening your legs  Right  And a daughter would tell  A mother would tell the daughter that  Right  As kind of a joke  But you know  Just keep your legs closed  Right  And that's  But to come out  And pretty much say  Hey ladies  Just keep your fucking legs closed  That's what he said  That's pretty funny  It is funny  That's way funnier  Than anything Rami has said  But she doesn't really appreciate that  Why?  Because she's a woman?  Hey ladies keep your fucking legs closed  Because she's a woman?  Yeah  He was saying in the old days  Yeah  Before women were  Freer and more liberated 
[01:36:30]  Right  I guess  God I must be a complete asshole  Because I see nothing wrong  With saying that  I don't either  Alright  I like it  I think it's funny  She had to sit there like a dummy  Yeah  She had nothing to say  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not  And he was like  Look I did good there  Can you hear that again?  Oh please  This contraceptive thing  My gosh  It's so  It's such inexpensive  You know  Back in my days  They used bare aspirin  For contraceptives  The gals put it between their knees  And it wasn't that costly  Excuse me 
[01:37:00]  I'm just trying to catch my breath  From that  Mr. Freeze  Thank you  He sat there  He sat there  Sat there for a good three beats  With that dumb smile on his face  Waiting for the place to fucking howl  Someone's saying that was a very chip moment  See people fucking frustrate me  They don't understand the whole chip thing  No  It's not a chip moment  At all  No  They don't know what chip moments are  A chip moment is a fucking joke 
[01:37:30]  That makes absolutely no sense  That's why I block a lot of chips  Because they don't understand it at all  It's like  The easiest thing in the world  Is to follow the chip formula  Right  And then they can't even get that  Right  And it's the irony of like  Chip is this hacky  Doesn't get a good joke guy  Right  And then they don't  They can't do that  Right  And that's what  That's the genius of chip in my mind  Right  And boy oh boy  Does it make me laugh  Every time someone fucks up a chipper  Yeah chip is  It's very subtle  It's  But  I don't see how you get that wrong 
[01:38:00]  Like how do you  Misinterpret that  Because if you tweet a joke  And they don't like it  They'll go  It's like it's chip  No  That's not what it is  You idiot  That means you just didn't like that joke  That's fine  It's not a chip joke  But it's not a chip joke  You dopes  That guy is hilarious  That's hilarious  Fucking hilarious  He was fucking going for like  Old school like  Yeah  Right  This is what we used to tell the broads  Yeah  That was a broad joke  We used to tell the broads that  Right  Keep your fucking legs closed 
[01:38:30]  Right  Get in the kitchen  Start rattling those pots and pans  How is that a chip moment  It's not  That's a  Leaned over and gave her the forearm push maybe  Right  That's a male chauvinist thing  Yeah  Yes  I love it  It's a male chauvinist thing  Marcus believes the aspirin between the knees  Was meant to be a metaphor  In what way  A metaphor  What is he getting deep with this fucking thing  Marcus  What are you talking about today  No no no  I was just  Ant said the same thing 
[01:39:00]  I was going to say  The legs closed  I was just listening to hear the show  You know  That's all  Marcus Aurelius  Alright  Alright guys  Alright  Alright  Marcus  Yeah  He just wanted to be on the air  Every day  Every day  Every day  He wants to be on the air  Gotta have something  Yeah  Vinny in Jersey knows that  I didn't know this was a very old joke  He had to explain it to me obviously  But Vinny  You got more on this  Or are you going to just say what Ant said  I mean  Yeah  I'm pretty much going to say what Ant said  But  My grandfather used to say that joke 
[01:39:30]  I mean  And  Marcus is kind of right  It kind of like  Was a metaphor  Just  You know  Basically just to keep your fucking legs closed  I mean  Yes  That's the bottom line  I used to tell the girls that  If the man wants to take you to the submarine races  Make sure you put an aspirin between whatever  Let her rip  Oh Christ  Just let her rip  You gave Ant a great setup  You guys were working together  But then you had to fucking move away  Oh well  Whatever  You had to move out of his way  Go ahead  Go ahead  Thanks Vinny  You think she might have thought it was some kind of plan B fucking thing though 
[01:40:00]  She probably didn't understand the reference  That it's just an old school kind of joke  Right  You're just having a little fun  Having a little fun  Look he's not  He was no kid  That's for sure  You can have fun with some of this shit  Yeah  But maybe she's thinking that's a plan B thing  Yeah  Like you just pop a pill  And it takes care of the situation  Put a bare aspirin in her coke  And that'll make her spread her legs  That was like the old roofie  They thought if you put an aspirin in a girl's coke  They would  Loosen up a little bit  They'd be goers  Really 
[01:40:30]  Or Spanish Fly  Remember Spanish Fly  I sure do  Dude  A girl took this  And they found her dead  On the gear shift of her car  Cause she couldn't  Cause she couldn't  She was trying to fucking  She couldn't even  Imagine a girl so horny  From Spanish Fly  That she just  Hangs up on a gear shift  Until she dies  And we believed this shit  Growing up  Or she was on like  The bathroom doorknob  Oh man  Is that hot  Well that was before the internet  Proving everybody wrong  Spanish Fly  You just had to believe someone

[01:52:30]  What is the milk bar again  The milk bar is just like  It's a fucking diner  Where you have a milkshake  They call it a milk bar  A milk bar yeah  Because it doesn't serve alcohol  Yeah  It's like fucking  Where you at with the alcohol  Clockwork Orange  I'm on and off  You know  But medically I'm good  But medically  They wanted you to stop for a while  They stopped  Yeah no I've gotten the all clear  For all that  Why did a doctor give you  The all clear  All clear  Knowing that you're going to  Go right back to it  I haven't drunk for a few weeks  Does that count  You know but I don't  Actually no that's a lie 
[01:53:00]  I drank two days ago  Because it was my birthday  But apart from that  I haven't  Yeah  Give me birthdays  On Valentine's Day  You just find it boring  Not drinking right  I hate it  Yeah I find it really boring  Yeah  I don't know what it is  You just need some kind of thing  To do in a social atmosphere  Yeah  Smoking was good  That was like a thing  And drinking is fucking great  You find out that you dislike your friends  And you don't want to dislike your friends  Oh man  You're so fucking right  Yeah you're like  I don't like this guy  Unless we're both drunk  If we're both drunk 
[01:53:30]  He's the best guy ever  Yep  But if I'm sober  And he's drunk  He's a fucking cock  I've been in situations  He's been my friend for years  I can't let him down  Been in situations like that  Where you know  Your friends are all getting hammered  Yeah  You're for some reason not drinking  And then  I'm like fuck this sucks  Like they're loud  And like you're obnoxious  And then you start drinking a little bit  And you realize  Oh they're cool  Yeah they're cool  Yeah  Something changed  There was a weird thing with me  With drinking though 
[01:54:00]  Where  Like I used to drink  After every gig  And during every gig  For years and years and years  And I used to wake up  With that sort of like  I was a rock star feeling  Like  You're outrageous  You sit up in the bar  And get your cock out  You're awesome  Right  And now I wake up with  You're a disgrace  If you had a gun  On the bedside table  You should put it in your mouth  Right now  Why the change?  I don't know  It just happened  There was a day  Where it just stopped  Where I stopped enjoying it 
[01:54:30]  Like that  Yeah  It was depressing  Hey what's up with this Adele  I say that because  She was on the screen  You know anything about Adele  From  The fat chick from Britain  Yeah  Yeah  She sings good  She had nodules  And now she's singing again  Yeah  Yeah  But she's dead working class  Like yeah  Oh she sounds it  Oh yeah  Because when she talks  You could hear all that  Yeah yeah  She grew up above a fucking pound store  Like a 99 cent store  Oh really?  Yeah yeah  You don't get much more ghetto than that  That's kind of cool  She could have gotten like  Cutlery and stuff for dead cheap 
[01:55:00]  You know but  You ever meet her?  No I've never met her  But I think she got famous  In the last few years  Since I've been over here  A couple years yeah  Yeah yeah  She's alright  There's certain times  You see a photo of her head  Where you're like  Oh who's that girl  And then you just look closer  And you go  Oh it's Fatty McFatterson  Yeah  We call that Iceberg  She sings all these songs  About fucking breakups  I know  Just stop it  What are you talking about? 
[01:55:30]  She's empowering fat chicks too  Yeah  It's like oh I don't have to  You know Adele  You listen to the words of her song  It's like she's been screwed over too  And she's like powerful  She's just upset  That they took the McRib away  Oh god  Yeah but she's  She's tricking everyone  She's got the sexy name Adele  And she sounds like that black sexy singer  Yeah  You know  And then you get a picture of her  Which one's the black sexy singer?  She sounded like that  Before I saw what she looked like  I was convinced this was a black girl 
[01:56:00]  Oh man  And a sexy one of them  Yeah  Of course  You can tell sexiness through a voice?  Yeah  Well that's the whole premise of the TV show  The voice  You can't tell until your chair spins around  Didn't you stay on after the Superbowl?  That's what I'm talking about  So that would have been my image  Before I fucking pushed my button  To turn my chair around  I would have thought black sexy singer  She looks like an over  Not fat pig  She looks like an over inflated Twiggy  You know  Remember Twiggy from the old days?  She's like stumpy 
[01:56:30]  Twiggy was known for her anorexia  Yeah, yeah, yeah  But she's got like that same kind of face  If it was slimmed down  But  I loved her acceptance speech  Just because she sounded completely like you said  Like a working class girl  But same as Victoria Beckham  They called her Posh Spice  But she's fucking working class scum  If ever  Yeah, yeah  Oh really?  I'm all for that  I have nothing wrong with it  There's nothing posh about her  She can walk posh  And she can look posh  But she can't talk to posh 
[01:57:00]  She ain't posh  Oh, I thought you grew up like Thoroughbred  No, no, no  Down and dirty, huh?  Yeah, she's proper scum  Oh shit  Did you watch the Grammys?  Did you watch the Grammys?  I watched the first bit and lost track after they did a prayer for Whitney Houston  Yeah, that was a little weird  Yeah, nothing like a crack angel in heaven  You know, we didn't talk about this much on the show  But it turns out that Clive Davis party  I have to think Clive Davis, Clive Owen  Clive Owen, Clive Davis  You know, the pre-Grammy party? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah  They still held it  And people are really fucking pissed off  Because Whitney's body was still upstairs dead in the room  That's good  Yeah, I know that  Because I was watching on the news  Because they were waiting to  The guests were bumping into detectives  And the coroner's office  They should have done a weekend at Whitney's  Just bring her down  Fucking dead  Why not?  When they first said that Whitney was dead  I was like  Fucking thank God  I'm sick of that sitcom  Yeah, a lot of people said that 
[01:58:00]  Damn, that's an angle  I didn't think of very good  Whitney  But, you know  And then stupid Nancy Grace  Is trying to like  Hint that she might have been murdered  But now she's getting  She's not fucking murdered  Of course not  Whitney Houston  Killed Whitney Houston  For what?  Yeah  Know what Nancy Grace said last night?  I asked Ant before the show  If he's ever seen this show  Nancy Grace is on Headline News  It is the worst hour of TV  Holy fuck  It's horrendous  If you've never watched it 
[01:58:30]  It's amazing  I watched the whole Casey Anthony thing  But I  I love the Casey Anthony thing  I've seen clips here and there  But I watched the entire hour  And she's got maybe five minutes of material  That she just tries to spread out  For an hour  Over and over and over  And then she has people ring in  And just want to go  First of all  I just want to tell you Nancy  How lucky your kids are to have you  You know when they do that  Like they're complimenting her as a mom  Right  Could you please tell me their names?  I have no clue  I'm here all the time  Well this is what she said yesterday  Hanging out with David Arquette 
[01:59:00]  And making out  It came out  It came out that she was  You know drinking her face off  Before what  10am at the Beverly Hills Hotel  She was around the pool  She was pissed off  Because they started watering down her drinks  Is this still Nancy Grace we're talking about?  Yeah yeah  But this is what Nancy Grace says  It turns out there was an eyewitness  That saw Whitney doing laps in the pool  And Nancy Grace goes  If you're drinking  That's impossible  Not impossible  Of course it's not impossible  It's not like swimming 30 minutes  After you have a meal  Now that's impossible 
[01:59:30]  But she's just  She's looking for any little tidbit  Yeah  And trying to stretch it into something  It's not impossible  To drink your face off  And then go swimming  I've been drunk  In most cases  And not only have I been drunk  And gone swimming  But I've had to climb a fence  To go swimming  That's even harder  Yes  And run away from the people  Who own the pool  Right  That's a lot of different activities there  She's fucking delusional  Of course you can do a couple laps  If you're shit faced  Of course  Especially in a hotel pool  Because first of all  What? 
[02:00:00]  It's not over your head usually  Sometimes a section of it  Right?  But in general  Most of it's not over your head  Well I didn't like the Grammys  When they  What's his name?  LL Cool J  I was surprised  I thought he was dead as well  I don't pay attention to everything  I'm surprised that he was hosting that  And he goes  Let's say a prayer  And it's like  Fucking hell  Why is God forced into a situation like this?  But musicians take themselves so seriously  That they all did like bow their heads  Like we've lost a family member here  And they're like  Too fucking right  Let's all bow our heads 
[02:00:30]  When a comedian dies  We don't all gather around  And hug each other  And say a prayer  No  We all talk  And make jokes  And make jokes about each other  It's not as  It's not in any way  More disrespectful in my opinion  At least it's real  But they're fucking up their own asses  Musicians  They should have  They should have done that prayer  When she was alive  Yeah  Yeah  She might have needed the help then  She doesn't need the help now  No  Ah well  Who's next to die?  Ah well you got  Well

[02:03:30]  Yeah cause we lost Gary Carter  I don't know  Are you a baseball fan?  No but I heard Bobo getting upset  Was he great?  He was memorizing  I was laughing because you guys were like going  How do you remember things from when you were four?  That's cause that's when his brain stopped developing  That was the last of it  That was like everything just stopped in time right then  That's the only things he remembers  Yeah  From when he's four  I feel sorry for Bobo  I said once flippantly  That I'd pay for him to get a prostitute  And he came along to a gig  And he pulled me up on it 
[02:04:00]  Like when are we doing this?  Oh really?  So you should have done it  I'll give him the money  But he seems to think that I'll help with the whole situation  I can't fucking facilitate as well  Did we get him a handjob yet?  No  We tend to get people handjobs around here  No  That's pleasant  Well  Or D.L. Hughley got one of our guys a happy ending  Massage  Everyone's done that  I've had a lot of them in my day actually  Really?  Yeah  Rub and tugs in Australia  They're quite popular  And it's not exclusively the Asian folk who gives them 
[02:04:30]  It's like regular people as well  Give them  I'm not saying that Asians aren't regular people  But we know they're not  But it's like university students and stuff  There's a lot less guilt than a hooker with a rub and tug  Yeah  Because it's just like  You seem to do it in your brain  Oh I'm just getting a massage  Nothing wrong with a massage  And  A massage  Massage  This young lady  She seems to need the money  So I'm helping her out  And she doesn't seem to be a very good masseuse 
[02:05:00]  So she has to work what she can  Just have a talent somewhere  You ever been to the rub and tug pile that has a hole in the massage table?  Oh man  So like a whole like sort of yay big like a size of a plate  Yeah  Right  Put your dick through it?  Yeah  So when you're laying down  So when you get your erection and your dick's sort of free flowing  The girl might reach under the table and give you a bit of a whack  Before you have to roll over  What the fuck?  That's convenient  Australia's a go-ahead country mate  We think about things like this  Bunch of goers  Yeah  Doers mate 
[02:05:30]  Do you guys believe in God there?  Australia's got a very low religious  Very low huh?  Very low yeah  What's that based on?  You know we're not stupid I guess  I don't know  Like I can't tell you the exact answer  But we don't have  Like you didn't grow up religious?  No  And I  There was very few religious people I knew  And they were looked at as probably weirdos  They were looked at yeah  The Christians  The Christian kids at school  There's like a group of ten of them  That all used to sit together  That we used to mock  At the lunch table  Yeah yeah  And talk about yeah 
[02:06:00]  And they're still pretty heavily religious  We didn't have like over here  Where it's like a whole area of Sydney  That is a religious area  I was like  And we didn't have like  There's no Jewish Australians  There's some Jews living in Australia  But there's no  I didn't know that  There's no like Australian  Like it's like  Oh yeah fucking shalom mate  There's no that guy right  But we've got a lot of South African Jews  That come over  Which is always weird  When I meet like an anti-Semitic Australian  Where it's like  You hate them  And you've never met one  Like that  Can't believe he took me penny 
[02:06:30]  I'll never pay that much for a didgeridoo  I'm trying to think  It's mostly Catholic and Christians  And stuff like that  There's not  There's not a whole heap of muzzies  Or anything like that  There's a lot of  Muzzies  I wish we used that here in the States  It's so wrong here  But why is that wrong?  Like it's so wrong here  That's just abbreviation  Muzzies  Why is that wrong?  Because it sounds like you're  You know  It sounds like a slur 
[02:07:00]  That's because it is  It's wrong everywhere  Oh okay  Oh but you know what  You guys use it more than we do  Well there's a lot of muzzies in Britain  Yeah  Yeah  They're packed with them  A little bit of a problem  Yeah they're having a big burker issue at the moment  About  About you have to take your burker off  If you go into the bank  But like the religious people are saying  No you don't have to do it  But if you have to take a motorcycle  It doesn't look like a robbery  If you do take a motorcycle helmet off  You have to take your burker off  But you don't even have to take your burker off  If you're going through airport security 
[02:07:30]  If you  Which you gotta think  That's a fucking suicide bomb waiting to happen  Oh hell yeah  Come on  Like I would burker up  If I was a suicide bomber  Yeah  They're not gonna check you  No  Fuck  They get away with fucking  Literally murder  As I was saying that  I'm like oh yeah  They don't really get away  They die as well  Yeah that's true  Alright they don't get away with shit  It's a draw  It's a draw  Not getting away with it 
[02:08:00]  But  But they're taking the piss  Yeah  Dude you got a clutter cleaner  T-shirt  Yeah  What the fuck  How fucking cool is that  Where did you get that  When they were in here  Yeah  Is that like the people off hoarders  Yeah  They're the ones that clean  My mother's a hoarder  A real life hoarder  A real life  Why haven't you ever told us this  I watch that show  And it fucking terrifies me  Really  What is her thing  Well see my mother  She always likes  Kids toys  Like she goes to garage sales  And she thinks that she's got things  For the grandkids  And now it's ebay 
[02:08:30]  And things come into the house  But like when I was  I was born because  My mother had two sons  And then she had one last go  At having a girl  Right  And when I came out  She wouldn't hold me  For the first few hours  Or something  Because I was a boy  And then wouldn't  Wouldn't unwrap the blanket  For a couple of weeks  Because she didn't want to see the penis  Right  Oh shit  Wow  Yeah  So that's the mental scarring  Right  Right there  Right  She was so disappointed  In me being a boy 
[02:09:00]  So then after that  She decided  That she was going to collect dolls  Like she was going to fill that void  Right  Oh no  There's literally  Thousands of dolls  In the house I grew up  And they're coming over you  They're like watching you  There was one that used to stare at me  When I watched TV  Oh  I used to  When I came home  I'd put a towel over its head  Like  Like it was going to be a suicide bomber  Or something  So I  So the whole house  Was just full of dolls  And then like  My parents had a caravan  In the backyard  And then that got filled up with shit 
[02:09:30]  And now my mum goes on  And she gets hobbies and stuff  And she starts filling all that  Yeah just like that  Right  But like  Like where  There's no surface in the house  That you could put something on  Everything  Wow  It's totally packed  Now after  There was  It was a four bedroom house  So after  Me and my brothers moved out  As soon as the room was moved out  Of that room  Was filled with shit  Really?  Just like  Yeah it would only take  A couple of weeks  Or something  So you couldn't just come back  And go into your old room  No  No no 
[02:10:00]  All the rooms are filled with crap  She's  Yeah and  Now she's  Just not mobile enough  To fucking get rid of any of it  Yeah  And she lies about  How much she gets rid of  She's like  She's like  Oh no no  I've gotten rid of a lot of it  No you haven't  That's what those hoarders do  Oh yeah  She's fucking  Everything means something  You watch that show  And you're like  Oh fuck  Sometimes it makes me  Really upset  And sometimes I'm like  Ah  Ah  That's what happened  Ah  Look at this one  And sometimes I'm like  At least my mum  Didn't have cat shit everywhere  Well that's bad 
[02:10:30]  What type of parent are you  Well there are the hoarders  That just have the clutter  A lot of stuff  And then there's the disgusting people  That I don't consider hoarders  They're just lazy fucking slobs  Yeah they're just slobs  They're not collecting  Like I can understand  It's like  Alright you're a crazy person  You have a bunch of dolls  Or you got this or that  Or the other thing  My mum was an unhygienic  Right  But then when you get  The fucking people  They're not collecting garbage  They're not hoarding garbage  They're just lazy fucks 
[02:11:00]  That don't want to clean up  And it's always like we said  That woman is like  I have fibromyalgia  I have Epstein-Barr syndrome  I have no energy  Have you seen  There's a new show  Because there's hoarders  And now another channel  Has just stolen the ideas  Hoarding Buried Alive  Hoarding Buried Alive  And the only difference  Between the two shows is  Hoarding Buried Alive  They don't clean out your house  Yes that's true  And it's the only difference  They try to teach them  How to clean it out themselves  That is one guy  On like the first episode  Where it's like 
[02:11:30]  He had a girlfriend  And she's like  I love this guy  He's the best guy ever  But he always comes  Over to my house  And they're both like  45 years old  And then she's like  I don't care  Anything that you can show me  Honey  I'll be fine  I love you  And we can get over  Any hurdle  And then she came in  And she's like  This is fucking bullshit  Like this guy was like  Climbing over garbage  Like he had no  Walkable service  And by the end  At the end of the episode  She was like  Fuck him  I'm not going out with him  He's a fucking maniac  And you know why  They don't clean the house  Because they don't have the budget  Yeah 
[02:12:00]  They don't have the budget  That's all  They don't have the budget  So they make believe  And that's how they come back  And see how they're progressing  And that guy's like  Oh you know  You can open the door now  That's a big leap for me  Yeah  Like you know  When they see him in the hoarders  And they're like going  Okay we're going to have to  Get rid of stuff  And you're like  There is a mountain  Of fucking shit  There are seven rooms of shit  And you're going  This baseball  Does it mean anything to you  And the person's going  Debating  And you just think  It's going to take years 
[02:12:30]  Are you doing this  With every item  Yeah  There's only 200,000 items  There's 200,000 items  You can't spend  Five minutes  On every single  Fucking little thing  Do the math  You're not going to  Even make a tent  You just have to get a shovel  And just go  We're getting rid of  This fucking shit  That's what we say  What you should say  In that show is  Go through the house  And select 200 things  That you can't do without  You've got five hours  To do it  And if you haven't selected it  It's fucking gone  It's getting thrown away  Right  It's gone  That's your only choice 
[02:13:00]  They don't fucking understand  Also that they're going  To lose their house  Their kids  And they're like  Yeah there's a problem  I really need to do this  And then they  Start yelling at the people  No you said  I could look at things  Before you throw them away  And then they go  Into the truck  And they start going  Through the bags  And shit  It's like  No that's the stuff  That was thrown away  I don't think  There's a better TV show  About mental illness  Oh it's fantastic  I love mental illness  We really do love  Watching mentally ill people 
[02:13:30]  I always like  When they do the backstories  Where they're talking  To the lady  And the lady's like  I think things got  Really out of hand  When my husband  Left me  And it's like  That's because he did  All the cleaning  Yeah that's  It wasn't the  And it's mostly  It's mostly women  For some reason  Mostly women  It's like 10%  It's men  Yeah  There was that one guy  On just the regular hoarders  Who they reckon  He was hoarding rats  Yeah yeah yeah  And he had like  10,000  20,000 rats  Yeah but that was 
[02:14:00]  That was bullshit though  If it was city rats  I would have been impressed  It was the pet store rats  Pet store rats  But he let him  Because they made a big deal  About it  I'm like  Holy fuck  He's got rats in his house  But it's the  Almost lovable ones  Yeah but  There was  Millions of them  Well there was  A couple  Thousand  Sure  There was more than  A couple of thousand  Can you imagine  If it was the subway rats  I don't discriminate  No a rat's a rat to you  I don't know  I didn't know  There were different types  Are they  I've never been a big fan 
[02:14:30]  Of like  Are we allowed to replay  Our rat show by the way  E-Rock  Not to interrupt Jeffries  Which I do  But it needs to be  When did E-Rock  Bleach the top of his hair  Oh god  What the fuck  Every time I see you  It's something weird  What have you done  To your head  Hi Jim  You're trying to  Distract the weight loss  You have no idea  His whole head  Was bleach blonde  For a while  Really why  And he let it grow out  But he's  I guess  Did you redo  The top of your head  No I was just  Letting it grow longer  So I could cut it out  So  My  My mother  Okay to this day 
[02:15:00]  I've always wanted  To have a tattoo  But I'm not getting one  Until my mom's dead  Oh really  I'm still terrified  Of the fucking woman  Doesn't matter how  You don't even live  Close to her  Cause I just think  I only have to wait  Like a few more months  Tops  Right  So  So I've  I've never  I've never got a tattoo  I've never like  I'm glad about a few things  I never got my ears pierced  Cause I always thought  When you know  When you're like 13  You're like  I'm gonna get an earring  And now I'm like  I'm glad I don't have an earring  I wouldn't want a fucking earring  But when I was a kid  I really wanted one  You know  My brother comes home 
[02:15:30]  He's 18  And he had this fucking girlfriend  Who he's married to now actually  But she bleached blondies hair  It was the late 80s  That's what it was done  Like that white type of thing  My mum fucking wigged out  So fucking bad  That he couldn't admit  That it was his girlfriend  That did it  And he had a friend  Who was an apprentice hairdresser  So he said  Oh  It was that guy  Who did it  Right  Oh shit  My mum got in the car  To go into the hairdressers  And just abuse him  Oh man 
[02:16:00]  My brother had to ring the hairdressers up  And just go  My mum's about to come in  And just call you a cunt  Just be ready  She sounds like a scary woman  Oh she's a fucking scary woman  I tell you  I went back to Australia  And I met up with a whole lot of guys  I went to school  And my mother's a school teacher  At my school  And it's like  These were like the cool kids  That I wasn't in the group with  Or whatever  And they all came to my show  And I was like  Wow the cool kids have all come  And one of them was like  I always thought you were a good guy  But I couldn't be your friend  Your mum fucking terrified me 
[02:16:30]  Like it's just  My whole life  Wait she was a teacher at your school?  At my school  Yeah that makes it impossible  To bring anyone home to your house  My mother was  My sex education teacher  For an entire term at school  Because my fucking sex ed teacher  Ironically got pregnant  And was on maternity leave  Ironically  She couldn't figure that out  See that's the thing  Because my mum was a casual teacher  But she was there like  Four days out of five  Like shit  But you'd never know  What class  You were going to walk into  And go  Oh fuck 
[02:17:00]  So there were days  Your mum was teaching you  Oh yeah yeah yeah  So I'd walk in this class  And like  I'd hear my teachers sick  And my mum was like  The first person they fucking called  This teacher was away  For a whole term  And that entire semester  Was when we were learning  Sex education  My mum was in charge of that  And I just didn't show up to it  The whole semester  And so to this day  I've never officially had sex education  Oh wow  You learned yourself I guess  You figure it out  Yeah you do figure it out  I think so  Better than they could ever teach 
[02:17:30]  I think so  You keep rubbing it  Until it spits  Like how long do these things take  Trial and error  I only learnt recently  You have to ask  That sucks  I remember  Because I went to the first class  And she did the thing  Where she pulled the chart down  That had that picture  That side on picture of the penis  Yeah  Where it's like  Just that testicle  Yeah sliced  Yeah you could see what's inside  Cross section shot  Yeah it's horrible  And the fucking ovaries 
[02:18:00]  That look like a cow's head  You know when they sort of show like  A steer  Yeah like a steer  Oh there it is  It's the side of the fucking  Yeah yeah  It's fucking gross the penis eh  Side on  Yeah  Absolutely  It just looks like  It could break really easily  Like that little tube  That goes to the balls  That shoots up around  Into your abdomen  And then shoots back  Through your cock  That doesn't look like  It's a sturdy bit of apparatus  Yeah it looks very  Flimsy  The whole thing looks flimsy 
[02:18:30]  When you see it this way  I guess  It needs like a rib cage  Around it  How about a little protection  For the balls  That would be nice  But it's all  Have them just outside  Your body constantly  But it's all to keep them  Cold isn't it  No yeah I know the reason  You gotta keep the temperature right  But then you go  Maybe all your organs  Feel that painful  If they were punched  Yeah  It's just that  Our testicles are the only ones  Who've had punched  Yeah  Like if  If you didn't have like  A rib cage  And your heart was just like  In a sack  Hanging off  Like hanging in a tit  Off your body 
[02:19:00]  And someone goes  Some cunt just punch me  In the heart  That's fucking horrible  I think you're right  Why do we always just assume  It's just the balls  Yeah  I bet you  I bet you if you punched your lung  It wouldn't be fun  He's right  If there was just a thin layer  Of skin protecting  Everything  Oh my liver  Yeah  The liver would hurt  Well that gets a little  That gets fucked up anyway  You can feel the liver sometimes  Yeah  Oh  But imagine that  Yeah  Every organ  Just barely  With some scrotum skin around it 
[02:19:30]  Just hanging  Scrotum skin  Punched  Punched in the fucking kidney  You just have a kidney  Just hanging off the side  Of your arm  In a scrotum  You're fucking  That would hurt  You're right  Fuck  Dr. Jeffries  It's just a theory  I don't know for sure  I'm sure there's a doctor  That can ring up and go  No we've actually tasted this  You can punch a heart  All day  Dr. Mengele  And it won't bother you  In the slightest  You're at that Levity place  I've never been there  It's quite nice  I was there for Jim Brewer  It's a great room man 
[02:20:00]  You're going to have  A good time up there  How many shows are you doing?  Friday, Saturday, Sunday  I think we're doing  Two on Friday  Two on Saturday  One Sunday  One Sunday  It's Levity Live  It's once again Danny  It's the Palisades  Fucking  Inside  Inside the Palisades Center  And that's West Nyack, New York  845-353-5400 for tickets  Yeah they do a good job up there  You know what?  And the food's really good  Can I do a very vague plug  For something else?  Sure  I was in Washington last week 
[02:20:30]  And the ticket sold out  Like a month and a half in advance  So my agents have booked me in  To do a theater in Washington  In April  And I don't know  What the name of theater is  I don't know what day in April  But for the people in Washington  Who missed out  They'll figure it out  Google it  Fuck faces  Like you know what I mean?  Like it can't be more exact than that  I've set you on the trail  How about you get the info  And you tweet it  Jim Jeffries on Twitter  With the two F's  Yeah I don't know  If I'll be doing that  Nah  Twitter's like  I find Twitter  To be very painful  I still do it  But  Yeah I don't know  What the end game is 
[02:21:00]  Yeah  I don't know  What we're supposed to be doing  And whenever I plug a gig  Because I feel that's what  I'm meant to be doing  You're trying to sell tickets  For people to come and see me  Or letting my fans know  That I'm coming to a town near them  Yeah  And then you say  I said like yesterday  I went  Oh I'm going to be  On Opie and Anthony  In the morning  And then people go  Fuck you  You never write jokes  On this  What?  I'm like  Listen to Opie and Anthony  I might say something funny  Something like that  I just made a great observation  About your organs  Being in scrotums  Yeah you're  You're turning a lot of people  On to the fact 
[02:21:30]  You're going to be telling jokes  On our show  Yeah exactly  So I find  I find them  I find them very  Fucking cockish  The  The Twitter fact  I hope it all  Develops into something  That makes sense  Because it's just bizarre  I like it the way it is  Just stupid  There's no real  Fucking  Just keep it dumb  There's no real purpose for it  I do enjoy  Finding out  That a celebrity is dead  Through the medium of jokes  That's what it's boiled down to now  You're right  Remember in the old days 
[02:22:00]  You used to watch it on the news  It was all serious  And now it's just some horrible joke  About someone being dead  And you're like  Excellent  Everybody fights to get the first joke out  Or just like something about Japanese people swimming  And you're like  There must have been a big tsunami  Oh I'm glad I found out that way  That really cushioned the blow for me  Yeah you almost have to put the puzzle together  What it is  You read some tweets and go  Alright did this person die  Are they injured  What happened here  And the thing is  I get all my jokey tweets  Tweets off just like comedians 
[02:22:30]  And stuff like that  I get all my serious tweets  Off porn stars  Porn stars have the most serious tweets ever  Yeah they do  They're always like  Whitney's dead  God rest his soul  Such a great artist  Yeah  Who the fuck  What's her name  That was with Charlie Sheen  Brie  Yeah  Brie Olsen  She tweeted something last night  That was like  Yeah I do porn  And I earn money  And I pay my taxes  And it's like  She was going off on  I pay my taxes  I'm a taxpayer  Is she back doing porn is she 
[02:23:00]  I guess so  I was a big fan of hers  Oh is she  I don't know  She said something like that  I'm glad she's back  I was worried about her being gone for too long  I like her  She took her cock up the ass like a trooper  Didn't she  It's like it didn't even touch the sides for her  She was straight on  And I'm not a pedophile  I want to stipulate that  But she has that voice like she's a child  I don't know why I dig that  Yeah she talked about that on our show  Did she?  She doesn't mind acting a little younger  A little younger  She doesn't mind  A little  She's still in the womb 
[02:23:30]  That's how fucking young that girl connects  Alright why don't we take a break  So you got Levity Live this weekend  In West Nyack  It's a great club  And like I said  I said the food's great  Because most of the comedy clubs  Their food is hurting  Yeah no it's not  But see the thing is  I was living in Britain for 10 years  That's like fine dining  Any comedy club for me  So I'm alright with it  Yeah  And I think what Jim was trying to plug before  Oh good  Was that on April 20th  He'll be performing at the State Theatre  And you can get your tickets  They are on sale today  Nice  Today at noon 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  You can get your tickets for that show  It's a huge  It's a huge gig  State Theatre  So April 20th folks  Is that where Lincoln died  Is that the same  Ford's theatre  Is that theatre still open  Oh yeah it is  You've never seen it  No  And they'll take you across the street  And show you the bed he died in  Oh excellent  And the bed's still there  But he didn't  I thought he got shot in the fucking head  He did  And then he died in bed later on  Yeah  They took him across the street  How thick was his beard  He got shot behind the ear 
[02:24:30]  And it lodged behind his eyeball  I went years ago  But I think you could still see the blood  And everything on the pillow  I really enjoyed Washington  For wandering around  And looking at shit  I love checking all that shit out  I like going to the museum  There's like that one museum  Like the natural history one  Where in the end  It's like  There's all these really good stuff  But then the only bit I wanted to see  Was like Archie Bunker's chair  Right  That's what everybody does  And Fonzie's jacket  That museum sucks  It's one step up  From being a hard rock  Or a planet Hollywood  Yes  What are you  The  Smithsonian  That is 
[02:25:00]  The biggest let down  The air and space one  Is fucking awesome  I like that  Me and Ann ended up going there  Before we signed with XM  Love the air and space  That was so funny  This is what I think  Because we were talking about UFOs  And all that type of stuff  I'm a big believer that  Like  So I saw the Wright Brothers plane  Right the other day  Like last week  And that's like 110 years ago  Or something  Yeah  And now we're just like  A fucking stealth bomber  Like in 110 years  We've got fucking  Batman's plane  Now  That's crazy  Now give us another 200 years 
[02:25:30]  Think of the fucking shit  We'll have  Well  As long as we  Maybe get the space program back  But even World War  Even World War 1  Where they've got like  They've got their Red Baron planes  Yeah  That was like 10 years  After the Wright Brothers  They were already going  Oh yeah  We'll just fucking attach things to this  I always thought how fucked up  The Wright Brothers would think  If they flew in a jet  In a passenger jet  Right now  Yeah  Like where you're walking around  They had to lay down  And it's like  They were on a sled  Like when you go on a sled  Down a fucking hill 
[02:26:00]  That's how they were laying down  And then they'd fly  And look down like  And they'd just go a few yards  You know what's great about it  Like wearing a suit  As well  Like it was still like  I'm doing the most dangerous thing  That man has ever done  But one must look proper  He's got his bow tie on  He's got his bow tie on  He's got like a hat  Like he's been playing with a train set  They couldn't figure out sweatpants back then  Yeah  How did they invent the plane  Before sweatpants 
[02:26:30]  Right  Oh god  They really just invented a big kite  Or even just shorts  Shorts  Anything  Like no one back then  Could figure out that  If you're going to go to the beach  Maybe you cut some of the clothes off  Yeah  To keep yourself cool  And why always with stripes  When you went to the beach  Why  Why did everyone have to look like that  I don't know  I'm amazed  I understand you gotta  You gotta grow as a society  But you would think  That some of this stuff  Was no brainer shit  Even back then  There's a lot of inventions  In this world 
[02:27:00]  That you think to yourself  How fucking long  Did it take us to do this  That's what I'm saying  We can put them out of the way  Like putting wheels  On a suitcase  When I was a kid  That really  It came in when I was about ten  Right  Everyone was just carrying  Fucking suitcases  And no one could see  Like these happy things  With like fucking handles  Right  Filled with all their  Worldly possessions  Just walking along  With their backs breaking  Right  Till like one cunt went  Put two little wheels  In the boat  Right  You're so right  It took for fucking ever  How long  How many years 
[02:27:30]  Do you think it should  Have been  That should have been  Like the year  They invented suitcases  Should have been  The same year  They invented  Putting little wheels  On there  The next year  After here's suitcases  Year two  Here's suitcases  With wheels  Here's suitcases  I'll give them  I'll give them the first year  It's just going  Sack  Suitcase  Suitcase wheels  How many years  Did it actually take  You think  Forty  I reckon they came in  In like the  Late 80s  I don't remember  But suitcases  Have been around  Since the fuck  1800s  Since the fucking  Dawn of time  Suitcases  Since people had shit 
[02:28:00]  And like  How long were you  At the fucking  Post office  How long were the  Post office  Selling stickers  Like for kids  To put on their  Books and stuff  Yeah  And that dumb old  Cunt was still  Using a sponge  For a stamp  Just going  Oh yeah  There can't be a  Better way  To put these  Stamps on  Here have some  Free stickers  Do they feel  And now  Stamps  Do you remember  This  Did they really  Have stickers  At the post office  I don't remember  We've had stickers  Since we were little 
[02:28:30]  Kids  That you put on  Your skateboards  And stuff like that  But for some reason  Stamps  You were licking  Them forever  Until they realized  They could just  Make them sticky  On the back  Until they make  We have stickers  But no one  Made the connection  No one made the connection  Because well this is  The way the stamps  Have always been  There's probably some  Cunt that went  No no that won't  Be as collectible  Fuck you you nerd  I don't want to  Have that stuff  On my tongue  But the little  Sponge  Just like a retard  Just  I've got this little  Sponge that I keep  Slightly moist  So it's at the 
[02:29:00]  Right level  So I can put it  On to the thing  There's got to be  A few more examples  I'd like to find  Can you find me out  When they started  Putting wheels  In suitcases  It's got to be  A bizarre like  I don't think  It's more than  Ten years old  Well no  At this point  I guess it is  It's at least  Twenty years  But I remember  Being a kid  Thinking oh  That lady's fancy  Look at her  That's no strain  On her back  That's really funny  Brother  Oh god  We'll break  And we'll  Continue down this road  I want to think  Of a few more  They were first  They were first introduced 
[02:29:30]  In 1970  No one saw them  In 1970  That was only  For the elite  Wheels  For commoners  Never  Even in 1970  They had suitcases  Like in the 1800s  And shit  Same thing  How people were  Carrying their shit  No one had wheels  On their suitcases  Well into the 80s  Easy  Yeah  You know what's  Also fucked up  The first ones  They made  The wheels  Were on the skinny  Side  Yeah  So it was  Constantly tipping over  And they didn't have  The handle that pulled out 
[02:30:00]  You're just sort of  Dragging it off  A little bit of cloth  That dangled  That dangled  Off the end of your bag  Then they realized  If we turn it sideways  Make it a little taller  And slimmer  You had to bend down  Toward the  Toward the fucking ground  Even suitcases  Suitcases weren't even deep  They were the same level high  As they were deep  The zipper used to go  Right through the middle  Of the fucking thing  Like you didn't even  Zip it at the top  Like you would go  Through the middle  And there'd be a handle  On each side  Yeah  So like how people 
[02:30:30]  Packed them  I'll never know  To the capacity  You packed each half  And then had to slap it together  And then you hoped  That it slapped together  You had to get someone  To sit on top of it  Because you had to  Work the sides around  Our ancestors were stupid  Fucking stupid as shit  Dumb  Oh my god  That's hilarious  Why did it take so long  To invent the bike  We could keep going with this  The penny farthing  The what?  The penny farthing  Like when they had  That big wheel  With the little wheel  Yeah yeah yeah  That's retarded  Why couldn't they figure out 
[02:31:00]  Two wheels the same size  Why don't we just make  This wheel bigger  That wheel smaller  They already had the chain  The chain was already  Working out on the first  Automobiles  So the chain was invented  It wasn't the invention  Of the chain  But you had to  Look look at this  Asshole  You had to climb up  Onto your bike  And you know  And look you just  Look at it  And a logical person  Will go  Well why don't you  I did love the braking system  You just pedaled backwards  Yeah what if you're  Going downhill  Good luck  Yeah and they couldn't  Figure out the brake  Good luck you  Getting on it was good though 
[02:31:30]  Yeah  That had to be  I'd like to ride one once  It would be terrifying  It would be  Terrifying  Yeah man  Where could you ride  An old school bike like that  I think you'd have to  Sign some type of waiver  You think  Yeah  Sign some type of waiver  For a big wheel bicycle  I never saw that  Piece of paperwork  Like it would be safe  At a bungee jumping  To ride one of those things  Because just to stack it  Would just be  Because like  They did it on  On jackass didn't they 
[02:32:00]  They rode penny farthings  And went after each other  I didn't even know  The name of those things  Until just now  Penny farthing  Yeah I never heard that  I don't know why  It's called the penny farthing  It's probably  Because that's how much  It costs  Yes  One penny and one farthing  And one farthing  Oh here's another one  That's coming in  How are you  We couldn't figure out  How to shit indoors  For a long time  Yeah yeah yeah  We had to have toilets  Outside  But really far away  Yeah yeah  Because you didn't  You didn't want the stink  Coming into your house  Yeah  Yeah no that was retarded  But you know what  We're going to look back 
[02:32:30]  On a lot of things  Like I reckon  In 50 years  Where we just go  Because I even remember  Holding a CD  Going they'll never  Improve on this  Yeah  Because I had LPs  Going look at this  Fucking thing  They'll never improve  And it's like  You watch Back to the Future 2  And we still haven't like  We've got like  Two years left  To live up to that potential  Because it was in 2015  But there's things  That they didn't pick  Like he never rocked around  With an iPad  Like  Yeah yeah  As much as they thought  They could blow our minds 
[02:33:00]  The biggest thing  The biggest thing they could think of  Was a holographic shark  And shoelaces  That did themselves up  And they thought  This will fucking  Blow their minds  You've got to stop with  They'll never improve  On this finally  You know  We all thought that though  But you can't think that way  Well how can  Make a prediction  How can they improve  On the iPod  The iPod  Yeah like  You've already kind of  Moved on from that  No but like  Having it in your phone  Now it's in your phone  As a one  As a 
[02:33:30]  You know  Well think back  What they called  Smartphones just years ago  It was like  Why  You could get texts on it  You could maybe  See some news  On a web  Browser type thing  And now it's  You know  It's pretty much  A computer in your hand  It's like  It's like when  The internet first came out  And people didn't know  What to fucking do  With it  Didn't even know  What to do with it  And it was just like  Alright porn  It was just like  You look at  Even before porn  Like the real early stage  It was just like  Some bloke  Had written about sharks  And you know  It was cool  You could see that  From your house 
[02:34:00]  And you'd have that  Mate who had it  And you didn't know  How he had it  And he had to  Wind it up for  Fucking days  And there was that  Noise  And then you went  Hey look  Sharks  I think  To answer your question  They'll probably  Start wiring our brains  Kind of just  Throwing it all  Right in your  Fucking brains  Maybe  Some kind of  Weird hearing aid  Thing that you just  Have everything  Right there  3D TV  I sort of  Wanted one  And now I don't  Give a fuck  It's been a bust  Yeah  It's a bust so far  Yeah  On the outside  It sounds like  Oh that's pretty cool  That  Fuck it

Yeah  And I think  Because my dad  Will say things to  Like he obviously  Doesn't like my mom's weight  Because he'll say things to you  Like when I remember  Being very young  And my dad said to me  He goes  When you go out  With a girl  Try to find one  That's naturally thin  And if she  If she isn't naturally thin 
[02:43:30]  Make sure she works out  Like she's a health nut  Almost until it's an illness  See  He's basically  Trashing your mom  Almost until it's an illness  Almost until it's an illness  Yeah  He's trashing your mom  These curvy girls  They're a lot of fun  But don't take them  Too seriously  Holy shit  He's right though  Yeah  So she just had  Some nice curves  When she was young  She was a  Big boobs  Big tits  Yeah  Solid unit  Yeah  But she says things to me 
[02:44:00]  Now  Because I'm 35  Now  She had me  When she was 35  And she says things to me  Like  Oh you're gaining weight  I was never as big as you  At that age  Right  Like as a warning  Like ooh  It's like she  She thinks that  That fucking photos  Haven't been invented  Like I actually have to  Get her a photograph  And go  Here you are holding me  As big as a fucking house  Stop telling me  How fucking fat I am  Right now  Oh god  It's true though  What is it

[02:45:00]  And Brad Pitt will be on  And I know what she's about to say  You know what  Oh no  He's not as good looking  As you  I remember once  When I was  When my mother  Came to see me  Do a gig  When I first started out  I was doing a gig  And my girlfriend  At the time  Was sitting next to my mother  And she swears  This is what happened  I came out on stage  And my girlfriend went  Ah isn't he cute  And my mother went  And sensual as well  So she fucking 
[02:45:30]  Loves the hell out of you  Oh yeah  I'm the youngest  You know  The thing is  I'm not a good looking guy  But out of my two brothers  I'm a fucking model  You know  You're the guy  We have it  We're an ugly family  Of people  We're not  We're fucking  Trolls  Like the fact that  Occasionally I get an acting job  And I'm  You know  Even though in saying that  With acting  What I found really weird  In Hollywood  Is since I've gotten out  I never acted before that  And you go read for a part  And it turns out  That I'm  Depending on what week it is 
[02:46:00]  And whether I've put any effort  Into my looks  I can either go for  A good looking part  Of the ugliest man in the world  And so they send you  For these parts  And you'll go in  And in the waiting room  There'll be like  Let's say one actor's name's Kevin  And then the other one's Dan  And all the Dans  Are really good looking guys  With fucking chiseled looks  And open shirts  And tans  And then all the fucking  Kevins are just like  Fat retarded people  Just all sitting there  Just going  Oh you know  I might as well not lose the weight  It's what I've got going for me  In this acting world  Right  And then like 
[02:46:30]  Sometimes I'll walk up the stairs  And the lady behind the counter  Won't know what script to give me  That's depressing  Oh really  Is he a Kevin or a Dan  I don't know  That's not good  Yeah this guy's in no man's land  So you've got to commit either way  I've got to commit  This is what I'm thinking  You've got to go chiseled look  Or you've got to gain about 50 pounds  If I get really fat  I think I could get more work  It's like Jonah Hill or whatever  Who wants him now that he's skinny  Fat was his thing  Fat was his thing  Yeah  You do pretty good though  I've seen you out  Right  I've seen you out  You've got game 
[02:47:00]  I've got game  You've got game  I've got an accent  I've got an accent  Yeah you've got the accent  Yeah  And girls seem to be  You know  Attracted to you  Girls like me  Yeah  Yeah  I do good  I do good  Yeah mate  Me do good  Yeah mate  Fuck you mum  People do like me  Why is your mum in the hospital  She  Okay  I was out there just before  I was in the month of December  I was out for Christmas  So I did some gigs 
[02:47:30]  That month of December  And what happened was  She was  I was in Melbourne at the time  Doing some gigs  But she lived in Sydney  And she  She was walking along  With her cane  Holding a plate  And we're talking like  One mile an hour  Like the slowest  Like Yoda walks  You know what I mean  Like that little  Now she's always wanted  A fucking cuckoo clock  You know  The little bird comes out  Right on the hour  So last time I was in Germany  She made me fucking  Because they couldn't  Mail the one  She just likes me  To fucking go through  Pain of carrying  This fragile clock 
[02:48:00]  So I bring this  Cuckoo clock back  From Germany  To her a few years ago  Well that fucking  Stung her in the ass  Because as she walked by  At one mile an hour  On the hour  Fucking cuckoo clock  Came out and startled her  As it would  Like that's gotta be  Fucking terrifying  Little tiny bird  Going cuckoo  Like that coming out  Of the fucking thing  Anyway that was enough  For her to drop the plate  That she was holding  In her other hand  And then she sort of  Lost the balance completely  Oh shit  And she fell over  I imagine quite slowly  And she fell over 
[02:48:30]  And her knee  Smashed into the plate  And just shredded  Her whole fucking  Because her skin's like  Diabetic paper  Right  And the whole thing  Just there  And my father  Who she has hated  For over 30 years  Went Gary  Gary  And then my dad  Comes out  And he's like  Oh what the fuck's  Going on here  And she's lost like  Three pints of blood  Which is like  I don't know  It's like nine pints of blood  Or twelve pints of blood  Or something in the human body  And so  But she lost a fucking  Shitload of blood 
[02:49:00]  Right  So she's there bleeding  So this is what happened  My dad rings me up  Right  And he goes  He goes  Oh yeah  Your mum's had a bit of a fall  She fell over  She's hit a plate  And there's blood everywhere  She was screaming  And I came out  And I bandaged it up  Right  He's not worried about it  He's just talking about  How good his bandaging skills are  I bandaged it up really good  And he goes  Then the ambulance came  And they said  I did a very good job  So that was like  That was like  December the 18th  And she's still fucking in there 
[02:49:30]  Because her knee just gets infected  Oh shit man  That's what happens  And the physiotherapist doesn't  Like  She won't get out of bed  So I go in and visit her  On like  December 23rd  And I go in  And she's eating her fucking shitty meal  And they give her a little  Strawberry cheesecake thing  With a little fucking spoon  And I said  What the  And the nurse came in  I always acted all like the good son  I said  Excuse me  To the nurse  I said  Who's giving  My diabetic mother  Fucking strawberry cheesecake 
[02:50:00]  For dinner  And the  And the nurse looks at the chart  Like  Oh  You're meant to be  On a diabetics thing  And then my mum looks at me  Like I'm a fucking  Tattletaler  Like she grabs onto that dessert  With her little  Knarled up claw  For all fucking life  And she just goes  The doctor said I could  The doctor said I could  And then  And then the nurse  Just shrugs her shoulder  Shrugs her shoulders  Like  Yeah  We've been over this  I don't give a fuck  Have your fucking strawberry cheesecake  You can tell they fight her all day  About the strawberry cheesecake 
[02:50:30]  And she's still fucking having it  So because she's a diabetic  She has to have like  Chocolate and stuff  In case she has hypo attacks  Or a bit of lemonade  If her blood sugar gets too low  They've got to have that stuff  Yeah isn't that fucked up  That's exactly what happens  The thing you're not supposed to have  Is  It actually saves you  You have to have that in the house  Ready to go  Yeah  So my mum's in the hospital  And I know she's just fucking  Sneaking chocolates  Because she's like this  She goes  She goes  Oh  There's a box of chocolates  You have to bring in  In case I get a hypo attack  And I go  So you're trying to tell me  You're in a fucking hospital 
[02:51:00]  Where they have those machines  That go  Clear  Yet they don't have  The special hypo medicine  For you  If you get a little bit  Too low on your sugar level  They've got no bit of equipment  No little sugary beverage  They can give you  I have to bring you in chocolates  And she goes  Yes  That's what  That's what's happening  Yeah  Yes  Sounds like bringing  A junky heroin  Oh  There you go  Fucking get into it  Oh fuck man  Let me say hi to Simon  In Australia

[02:59:00]  I'll go Chinese  Yeah they're alright  They're on our team  Cause they  Had the game on  In Chinatown  So I would assume  That's the tie in  Yeah  We're too tired  To talk about Jeremy Lin  Or we'll give you more info  It's just been all encompassing  The last two weeks  He might be Japanese  Or something  No he's  Nah man  He's Chinese  You can tell by looking  He's Chinese right?  I think so  Roland you ready?  I am ready  Jim Jeffries  Pick a number  Between one and nine  Please  Aight  Aight

Yeah I am  Wow you're nervous or something  You really need these tickets  A little bit  Yeah  A little bit  Let me go to the hard question  Oh by the way  Roland doesn't want anyone to win  No  Cause he really  He gets the tickets  He really loves  When people lose  Wow he said I'll take you  Yeah  I believe you  Shit  But Roland 
[03:00:00]  How fucking ugly is your girlfriend mate  Roland  Roland loves to make it hurt  Because  That's a long story too  But yeah  Alright go ahead Roland  Bruce Song  The Ghost of Tom Jode  Was inspired by  The John Ford film  What is the name  Of the film  I want to say  The Grapes of Rat  No wrong  It was Clueless  With Alicia Silverstone 
[03:00:30]  I think he got it  What?  I think he got it  He did  Oh Roland  You thought that was a hard question?  Yeah  Yeah that was shit  How is that a hard question?  I should have done this one  Here's the one  You got it mate  Chris you got tickets  To see Bruce Springsteen  Whoa  Whoa  Whoa  Whoa  Whoa  We don't want to waste  Baby  You're going to Apollo  Ha ha  Right 
[03:01:00]  We don't want to waste  Too much time on this anyway  Cause we got Jim Jeffries in the studio  So I'm glad it worked out this way  But that's an easy question I think  I think that was too easy  Go ask another question  Let's see if we can get one of them  Let's see how difficult you think you are  This is what I was going to ask  Near the end of the Working on the Dream Tour  Springsteen and the East Street Band  Performed the River  In its entirety  For the first time  Madison Square Garden  In New York City  What was the day  The month  And the year?  November 8, 2009  You got it?  I would have said  These things are as easy as piss 
[03:01:30]  When you're reading over your shoulder  It wasn't November  I believe that  Chris  Hold on a line  I don't care  I don't know  I do know this  You got tickets to Springsteen  Congratulations  Thanks buddy  Thank you Google too  Alright, Lion 8 got the tickets  Thank you Roland  Anything else you want to say Roland?  No, I'm sad  What are you going to do this weekend?  Nothing  Because the 7 train is down  Woo!  What?  What?  No, the 7 train is down  So  So that just ruins your whole social calendar?  So you're disconnected from Manhattan? 
[03:02:00]  Well, it's a pain in the ass  You have to take the ferry  Or take the bus over to  Like three other stops  And I say fuck it  You get a taxi?  Eh, it's a long line  I could give you some taxi money  I'll just give it to you  I don't want you to ruin your whole weekend  How does your whole social life shut down?  Because the 7 train stops running  It's just a pain in the ass  So you're going to like  Wander around Queens  See if there's anything going on there?  You know what you need?  You know what you need?  I could show you around 
[03:02:30]  You need some local friends  That live right near you  Yeah, you make friends with the neighbors yet?  Yeah  Have a block party  I stay in my apartment  And watch Netflix  God  Is that your life?  Do you have a cotton candy machine?  Someone was just  Someone, Eric  Yeah, and a snow cone maker  Really?  You have a cotton candy and snow cone maker?  You know the next thing you're going to need  Is an insulin maker  Wait, E-Rock 
[03:03:00]  Have you seen this thing?  No, but he's been talking about it for so long  That he has a cotton candy machine  He'll play Uncharted on PlayStation  And he just stays at home  And has food delivered  Why don't you have a cotton candy machine  In your compound, man?  I'd be fucking  That'll just come into play  As evidence against me  Why would he have a cotton candy machine  In his house  If he wasn't trying to lure young girls  Why is there a box of tissues  Next to the machine?  Not napkins  Tissues 
[03:03:30]  What's the other machine you have?  The snow cone maker  Oh, snow cone  What about that, Ant?  I have snow cones  Nah, that shit's overrated  I'm not big on snow cones  Oh, I love snow cones  I'm not big on the snow cones  Ice with a little flavoring  Get that  I like that  What the fuck is this?  Primitive times?  Exactly  And the king would get ice  With flavors from  I have a hot dog machine  Oh, you do?  It has the hot dogs rotating  In a bun warmer underneath  That's pretty good  It's a perfectly sane thing to eat  Was it your grandma  Or my grandma  We told a story  Where when they were growing up  They would lick a fucking block of ice 
[03:04:00]  For five cents a lick or something  How pathetic  Oh boy  What kind of  What's that code for?  Was your grandmother a horse?  I don't know  If she had to change it  Into an ice block in her head  To  Oh boy  Maybe live  To sleep at night  Supposedly that's how pathetic  They were growing up  Yeah  The ice man would come by  And I don't know  I think he got some licks  Off the big ice cube  Carrying around his ice  Just with a handle  Yeah  No wheels on it  Hi Roland  The ice man 
[03:04:30]  Enjoy your weekend  In your apartment  With your cotton candy machine  I think  I think  Now that I've heard that  About Roland's life  I feel like he's just  The most eligible bachelor ever  A cotton candy  And a snow cone machine  That is fucking  There's a man that  You couldn't even buy  A present for Roland  The man who has everything  Eric was telling me  There's a broad around here  That might have a crush on him  On Roland  Or was it Mars?  Who was telling me?  Mars I think  Where's Mars?  Do you know anything  About this E-Rod?  He's very nice man 
[03:05:00]  We talked about it  On the after show  Is it a real crush  Or does she want something  From Roland?  I'm not 100% sure  But I suspect  That this person  Really likes Roland  She's always looking for him  She left him a valentine  What?  Roland?  Yeah  Sorry for the surprise  Of my voice  Really?  Sorry about that  I know  That's like  What?  Really?  A valentine  A valentine?  Have we seen this girl?  No I don't think you guys have  What is a valentine?  Is that just a card? 
[03:05:30]  Or is that chocolate  It was a heart shaped box  Of chocolates  With a little card on top  That's the last thing  Maybe they're trying to kill him  Valentines were a big thing  When we were growing up  You'd fucking  I never got any  My birthday's on valentine's day  So I never get shit  But I never got any  I never got any  When I was growing up  But I didn't want  The whole school system  To change their ways  Because I didn't get one  Now the school systems  They insist  Everyone gets one  Well see this is the thing  In my school  They had  Used to be able to send  Flowers anonymously 
[03:06:00]  A carnation anonymously  To a girl  So you could send like  A white flower for friendship  Pink flower for love  And a red flower for lust  And they'd be delivered  At a certain class  At a certain time  You could write a little message  And keep it all anonymous  Now because it was my birthday  A lot of my mates  Would send me  Like a red flower  In a jokey way  Now I'm a fucking spoon head  But like  On my birthday  Every day I'd be walking around  With all these red flowers  So the girls  In the younger years  Who didn't know 
[03:06:30]  It was my birthday  They thought  There must be something  Going on around him  He's very mysterious  Why is he getting  So many red flowers  So I always  You always got a bit more  Female action around me  Birthday  When I say action  Like finger to cheek  Finger pop  Little finger pop  Yeah  Some action  Sometimes you would get  For back in the day  I remember fingering  When I was young  Where I just shoved  The finger in  Not knowing what you're doing  Just poking at it  Not even  Poke back and forth  Just like  Alright we're in  Just 
[03:07:00]  We're in  Hold it there  Just let it marinate  Than that fucking  Thirteen year old  Vagina  I didn't get the  Fucking valentines  Because I was always  Really small for my size  People are saying  Because I was the  Stinky kid  I look like  You can't use that  When I was six  That sentence doesn't work  I'm really small for my size  You're really small for your age  Your size is your size  Small for my age  Right  I looked like I was twelve  When I was sixteen  Seventeen years old  It was a nightmare  When did you lose your virginity 
[03:07:30]  How old were you  I was eighteen in college  Geez I'd say  Yeah  First semester in college  I was late man  Real fucking late  Yeah it was pretty late  I was fifteen when I lost it  And then I didn't do it again  Until I was almost eighteen  But I got it out of the way  That's the worst thing about  What  You had to wait four years  After getting it one time  That's  That's even crazier  I didn't know what I was missing  But I got to  I got to say to everyone  No I'm not a virgin  I've done it  Fucking yeah  Yeah but then you're  All you want to do  Is do it then 
[03:08:00]  She was a smashing  Looking broad as well  But I'd like to meet her again  If you're listening  Samantha Krantz  Get in contact with me  Another girl  You want to get in contact  Where is she  You think she's listening  Where is she from  She was from Queensland  Ah  Oh yeah  She's the last  That's where Australian  Bobo's from  Yeah yeah  Oh wait  Queensland  I liked it  How old are you  What  When you lost your virginity  When I lost my virginity  Thirteen  Jeez that's  You're the shit  You're the shit  So it ain't  Yeah yeah yeah 
[03:08:30]  How old was she  She must have been like eleven  That must have been  No she was actually older  Nineteen  What  Yeah  That's  That's  That's crazy  That's fucking creepy  Age difference  Is crazy  But thirteen year old  And a nineteen year old broad  Wow  It was fantastic  I don't know  Good for you  But it's like that whole thing  Whenever they say  That there was like  There was like a school student  Who's been molested  By a teacher  When it's a man  It's disgusting  When it's like  Like fucking  Like you're proud of that 
[03:09:00]  Thirteen year old boy  Aren't you  Yeah yeah  She's alright buddy  Good for you  Like that bird  Who went to prison  Several times  For that little Samoan kid  That she is  Right  And they're not married  They're married  Kids  She was quite a tasty broad  Her  Yeah yeah  Or that other one  That fucking  What was her name  The one that was the model  For the biker magazine  Oh yeah  Remember her  The blonde  Yeah  I forgot their names now  We have this theory  That if you're an ugly teacher  They give you time  Right  But they let the hot ones  Sort of slide  Or if they have to do time  They do the easy time 
[03:09:30]  They know  Yeah yeah  They know  That chick was in and out  They know that kid's not suffering  Yeah yeah yeah  That's exactly right  I don't know  I don't know  One of my friends  That wouldn't have taken  A little something something  From an older teacher  Of course  And not be  You know  Fucked up by it  I have to stop you there  My mother was my teacher  Sorry  Sorry  I'm not saying  I wouldn't have  I just would have  Kept it more discreet  But if it was a 13 year old girl  And a 20 year old  Fucking science teacher  Then you know  It's a completely different thing

[03:25:30]  He  Kept  Trying  To  Find  Ways  Down  The  Escalators  That  Were  Locked  To  Get  Down  There  To  Start  Walking  Through  Roland  Told me  All  He  At  At  11  O'clock  In  The  Morning  11  O'clock  In  The  Morning  And  Then  He  Also  Found  That  There  Was  A  Free  Buffet 
[03:26:00]  So  He  Was  He  Had  These  Little  Grilled  Chicken  Sliders  That  He  Was  Dunking  Into  This  Kind  Of  Like  Spicy  Ranch  Sauce  And  It's  Giant  Stadium  Like  You  Just  Know  All  That  Stuff  Is  Good  It  Smelt  Incredible  But  Roland  Roland  Jumped  Into  It  11  A.M  When  Everyone  Else  Got  To  It  At  One  O'clock  When  Do  You  Think  Roland  Finally  Has  A  Major  Health  Problem  Like  What  Two  Years  Ago  What  Do  You  Well  I'm  Saying  He  He  He's  Fairly  I  Mean  I  Wouldn't  Say

[03:27:00]  We  All  Stop  Knowing  Each  Other  Yeah  Does  It  Happen  Before  Then  No  I  Don't  Know  Roland  Has  Been  Been  Like  That  For  A  While  But  It  That  You  Know  He  Could  Be  In  Here  Making  Fun  Of  Something  Making  Fun  Of  Eric  Or  Whatever  And  Then  We're  Going  To  Be  Wheeling  Him  Out  Here  I'm  Tasting  Metal  I  Can't  Feel  My  Left  Arm  I  Think  He's  Gonna  Come  In  He's  Gonna  Start  One  Day  He'll  Just  Be 
[03:27:30]  Kind  Of  Walking  A  Little  Funny  Because  My  Feet  Are  Just  Bothering  Me  And  Then  It's  Going  to  Get  Because  It's  Out of  Control  Yeah  I  Know  He  Doesn't  Care  But  But  Someone  Used  To  Like  Because  I  Think  He  Thinks  It's  A  Joke  Because  Everybody  Treats  It  Like  A  Joke  He  Probably  Doesn't  He  Probably  Doesn't  Think  It's  A  Joke  I  Don't  Know  Man  Didn't  You 
[03:28:00]  Because  It's  Always  In  That  Light  Of  Oh  It's  A  Goof  Oh  It's  Just  The  Radio  But  Someone  Has  To  Sit  Him  Down  Like  Really  Like  On  His 
[03:28:30]  Disc  After  I  Completed  That  Task  It  Was  The  Most  Depressing  Time  Looking  At  Where  All  Of  Us  Were  Seven  Eight  Years  Ago  To  Where  We're  At  Now  I 
[03:29:00]  Have  A  Vision  Of  Him  In  Their  Heads  Out  There  In  Radio  Land  Travis  Is  Built  Like  Dale  Gribble  From  King  Of  The  Hill  You're  Skinny  Fat  Yeah  But  Look  Like  Like  We've  All  Seen  Roland's  Pictures  From  Carson  Daly  So 
[03:29:30]  What  I'm  Saying  Is  If  I  Can  Look  Back  On  Those  Pictures  Of  Myself  I'd  Be  Like  You're  Putting  There's  No  Possible  Way  Roland  Takes  This  As  A  Joke  He  Looks  At  He  Looks  At  Those  Pictures  And  He's  Like  Yeesh  What  Do  You  Think  He's  Welcome  To  Come  Down  Here  I  Don't  Know  He  Was  Supposed  To  Be  I  Have  You  You  Told  This  To  Off  The  On  The  Off  The  I've  Told  You  Know  Even  Not  At  The  Workplace  I  Just  Want  What  Do  You  Think  Is  The  Biggest  Problem  That  He  Doesn't  Exercise  At  All  I'm  Just  Asking  Go 
[03:30:00]  What  Do  You  Think  Is  The  Biggest  Problem  Is  Diet  Or  That's  Where  I  Was  Just  Going  To  To  Do  We  Do  You  Think  That  Roland  Will  Have  Problems  Related  To  His  Diet  First  Or  To  His  Drinking  First  I  Don't  Know  How  Bad  Of  A  Drinker  He  Is  Like  I  I  Haven't  Gone  Out  With  Roland  Since  Like  You  Know  We  All  Used  To  Hang  Out  Roland  Starts  He  Means  Well  When  He  Starts  Off  But  Oh  I  Know  He  Gets  Really  Bad  If  He's  Having  Whiskey  It's  Really  Bad 
[03:30:30]  And  It's  Not  Like  He's  A  Dangerous  Drunk  Or  Anything  Like  That  He's  Very  Happy  And  Excited  But  He  Doesn't  Stop  He  Just  Keeps  Going  And  There's  No  Cut  Off  Yeah  But  I  Mean  Is  That  Like  A  Once  A  Week  Thing  Or  Is  That  Like  You  Know  A  Couple  Like  Six  Days  A  Week  Thing  It's  Well  If  He  Just  Gets  Really  Tanked  When  When  He  Gets  Drunk  Then  Whatever  He  Does  It  I  Think  It's  A  Weekend  Thing  So  No  It'll  It'll  Be  Help  Eventually  To  That  Extended  Eventually  It'll  Catch  Up  Binge  Drinking  On  The  Weekends  You  Know  I  Think  There  Comes 
[03:31:00]  A  Point  Where  You  Just  Like  A  Right  Already  I  Just  Can't  Fucking  Deal  With  This  Anymore  And  What  Is  He  Doing  Is  He  Just  Doing  Straight  Up  Bourbon  Or  Is  He  I  I  Know  He  Does  He  Loves  Jack  and  Cokes  Sometimes  He  Does  A  Little  Bit  Just  With  A  Splash  Of  Water  To  Switch  It  Up  As  He  Says  But  What  Drinking  These  Days  Eric  You  Still  Doing  Red  Wine  On  Ice  Look  There's  Nothing  Wrong  With  That  That  Was  A  Great  Story  I  Don't  Know  If  I  Ever  Told  It  On  The  Yeah  We  Talked  About  It  Yeah  Well  Now 
[03:31:30]  We  Were  Out  To  Lunch  Somewhere  No  No  No  House  B.B.  King's  B.B.  King's  B.B.  King's  It  Was  The  Ron  And  Fez  Welcome  To  Satellite  Party  Oh  My  God  Yeah  It  Was  B.B.  King's  It  Was  At  B.B.  King's  I  Don't  Think  It  Was  Yeah  It  Was  At  B.B.  King's  Because  I  Got  So  Hammered  I 
[03:32:00]  I 
[03:32:30]  realize that the guy... They were these smaller glasses.  They weren't full-size wine glasses. He was constantly  refilling it, so I kept drinking it,  not realizing that I was refilling all the time.  And after, I think,  fourth, fifth, sixth glass,  I just kept going and  lost count. I don't remember that being at BB King.  I do. It was definitely there.  I recall that. 
[03:33:00]  I don't know.  Yesterday was my first drink.  Oh, hang on. Yesterday was my first drink in two months.  Two months? Yeah.  I haven't drank in two months. What'd you have?  Yesterday I just had...  It was a vodka soda. What made you drink?  Was it just to have a beverage, or did you  want to get a nice buzz on? No, I just had  one. Yeah, see?  I think Roland's food problem is way more out of control  than drinking. I wasn't aware that you  stopped drinking. Yeah, I just  didn't... Roland strikes me as the kind of  guy that drinking isn't a problem for him. 
[03:33:30]  He just likes to drink. Only like for  if you have to go for work occasions.  No, he doesn't need to drink.  But I think Roland can't be  without his favorite foods.  No, I've been cutting back. I've been only doing like  one meal a day.  That's bullshit, Roland. I see you in the office  every day. No, I just have lunch. That's it.  It smells like a fucking cafeteria.  He has one meal a day for lunch.  That's it. I just have one lunch.  Then I don't have dinner. I just did...  That event was six and a half years ago.  Where's Eric going?  I don't know. Eric's got something to do.  You're right. It was BBK. 
[03:34:00]  I've never seen... Well, actually, I have seen this before.  When a host just gets up and walks out of his own show.  I was about to say I've never seen that happen before  on the hard radio, but I've seen it plenty of times.  Yeah, I can't believe how long ago that was.  Dude, you know, you start reminiscing about your time here, man.  And it's fucking unbelievable how long ago some shit was.  And you don't...  Like, it feels like it was yesterday.  Like, honestly, I feel like it was just a few months ago.  Like, we were doing that Traveling Virus thing  and the animation festival and all that stuff.  That was a fucking long time ago.  That was a long time ago.  Where did it all go?  I don't know what happened. 
[03:34:30]  I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  We moved.  I think we should take some phone calls.  You know why?  Because Sam doesn't like to take the phone calls.  I don't know why.  I think he's scared of phones.  Eric's back.  Hang on.  Hey, Braddon.  Because obviously your name isn't Brandon.  It's probably Braddon.  What's up?  This is the greatest After O&A live show ever.  Why?  Thank you.  The emotions that are bringing to me. 
[03:35:00]  It is just unbelievable.  Because Sam's not there.  Fuck that asshole.  Hmm.  All right, cool.  All right.  Kevin in Houston, spelled H-O-U-S-T-E-N.  Yeah, Houston.  Who the fuck is in there?  I'm sorry.  I just suck at spelling.  That's out.  Well, finally, we found something that you're terrible at.  Another production guy who sucks at spelling.  I know.  What is that?  What is it about that?  He's got it on Post-it notes, too, when he gives you.  He's like, oh, this is the chipper promo, whatever.  And he's misspelled promo.  How do I misspelled promo?  How do you spell promo?  P-R-O-M-O, right?  Yeah.  How do you? 
[03:35:30]  What's the correct way?  The O at the end looked like an eight.  Well, that's just, you know, extra.  I'm pretty sure Sal's not spelling words with letters or numbers.  Kevin in the misspelled Houston, what did you have for the show today?  Hey, guys.  Great after show.  Hey, I just wanted to defend Eric.  A lot of people put ice and red wine, especially people that are born and raised in Florida.  That is true.  I forgot about that.  Well, that makes sense.  That is a very regional thing.  I do apologize.  Here, we're taking live calls.  I don't even know who this is.  Who is this?  This is James from North Carolina. 
[03:36:00]  Gosh, this is Danny Ross.  The one and only.  Oh, my God.  Get out the tearjerker there.  But the latest on Ron and Fez, that Ron has a big announcement next week that he and Fez might split up.  Wow.  Who would have seen that coming?  You see, folks, this is why you need a phone screener.  When you call in and you give that phone screener all that shit because he didn't let your call through, that's what your call would have sounded like if he let you through. 
[03:36:30]  That's why you can never get mad at the phone screener.  Much respect to the phone screener.  All they do is get yelled at, except for Paul.  And, you know, it really is a tough gig.  Is Paul here today?  No.  Paul is out again.  How come our favorite guy, we love him to death, Bobo, how come this kid, all he wants to do is get back on the show his whole life for the last, like, what, four or three months has been about getting back on the show?  And then Gary Carter does.  It's a perfect opportunity for him to get back on the show and prepare and have something ready to go and make his big return to the show. 
[03:37:00]  And then he eats his own balls first thing in the morning.  Bobo tweeted after that phone call that it was really hard for him to talk about that on the air.  Well, I mean, because thinking about the Mets gets his dick hard, so it's always hard for him to talk about the Mets, especially Gary Carter.  I wish I had that MLB Network phone call.  I know.  We really need that.  There's got to be somebody in MLB, on the MLB Network, who can get that call.  Someone knows what time it was.  Somebody heard it.  Someone can get that to us.  He said that he called his Daniel from Queens because he wasn't promoting Opian Anthem. 
[03:37:30]  What time did he call?  Is that like, so if he was like to check into a hotel, he was like, oh, my name is John Carlin.  My name is, I'm checking under Momo because I don't want people to know that.  He called around 730.  Okay.  So if anyone has that audio, please let us know.  Yeah, we really definitely need that.  Opianthony at SiriusXM.com.  Let's go to, what is this, Avnut?  Now I just think Sal is just, he's just punching the keyboard as he takes phone calls.  You got a Twitter name.  Oh, is that what it is? 
[03:38:00]  Oh, I see.  Paul says, fuck you guys.  This guy was, it was too cool to actually give his real name.  He had a, oh, my name is Avnut on Twitter.  I love that too.  When people call in and it's like, hey, what's your name?  And they're like, hey, it's Clowny Clown Face.  And it's just like, dude, I'm not going to type Clowny Clown.  Like your name is Bob or Jim.  It's something tells me you're on your perspective.  It doesn't say Clowny Clown Face.  Go ahead, Avnut.  Or did I pick up Clowny Clown Face?  Avnut.  You want my real name?  It's Cah-Newt.  Me and my buddy were just sitting here wondering why we were enjoying the after show so much 
[03:38:30]  and we realized Sam wasn't there.  Oh, Cah-Newt.  You know, this is very mean-spirited.  You know, just because the kid isn't here one day doesn't mean that his show sucks all  the other days.  Cah-Newt.  I know.  Rick in Texas, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, the reason why Sam doesn't take phone calls is everybody hates his fucking ass.  Look, I'm not cherry-picking these phone calls, folks.  And we're not soliciting this stuff.  I'm just taking what comes in.  I'm not being mean.  I'm just being honest.  Sorry.  Sorry if I'm being mean.  Sorry. 
[03:39:00]  Anyway.  So, continue.  I want to hear more about WrestleMania.  Oh, yeah, right.  And I missed this because I was out yesterday.  So, what happened?  There was a big WrestleMania press conference.  And what happens at a wrestling press conference?  Um, they, you know, Vince comes out, whatever.  Did you bring his music so you could play it right on cue?  They did it.  They had the DJ there and everything.  Eric's like, I would have hit that way quicker.  How's Vince looking?  Uh, Vince?  Not good?  Not looking.  Really?  But he's been looking.  I mean, I haven't watched wrestling in a long time.  But for his age, he looks, he's still huge. 
[03:39:30]  He sounded sick.  He was in a dark purple suit with a light purple shirt and a dark purple tie.  All right.  Comes out, has the, you know, remember how he used to have that big.  It was a stylist, Patrice O'Neal.  He used to have that big, like, puff of hair.  Yeah.  But then when he shaved his head at that WrestleMania match with Donald Trump.  Yeah, yeah, I remember that.  He slicks it down like it's wet right out of the shower.  So, he comes out and he was not sounding good.  I don't know.  This is really gruff and he was very, very timid. 
[03:40:00]  I hope they get a picture with him before he dies.  I'm hoping nothing's wrong.  But he just, everyone else was more energetic and enthusiastic.  And maybe he had a cold.  I don't know.  But he walked out.  He just, he was not looking in the best of shape.  Oh.  So.  So he kicked things off?  Uh, no.  Um, there's some sports guy from NBC that now works for the WWE.  Oh, Len Berman.  No.  He got fired.  Um, I forgot his name.  But he came out there.  He was doing jokes and stuff and everyone's just like, uh-huh.  And he, he did the, uh, he hosted the ceremonies. 
[03:40:30]  Uh, Governor Christie came out.  Vince came out.  And then Triple H came out and talked about all the partnerships that, uh, that they set  up with the Jets, with the Giants, MetLife, et cetera.  Has the owners of the Jets and the Giants out there with him.  Grabs their hands and then throws them up in the air like this.  Who did that?  Triple H.  So they'll hold it like this.  And then they presented them with their own belts.  Of course.  Right?  Which is what they do.  So then now he's showing them how to wear the belt, like, over their arm and throws 
[03:41:00]  their arms up like, you know, they're champions.  And right after this point, the owner of the Giants and the Jets were supposed to come  out and talk to the press.  Mm-hmm.  Because there was a TV line, then a radio line, then print media.  And so ESPN.  Like for, for interviews?  Like one-on-ones?  Yeah, one-on-ones or, or, or little group things.  Uh, to discuss all of this.  And, uh, Governor Christie was out there for a tiny bit and then he left.  But the owners were supposed to come out.  He doesn't have much to say about wrestling.  No.  Uh, other than all the millions of dollars it's bringing into the local economy. 
[03:41:30]  And, uh, so the owners were supposed to come down and talk to, you know, ESPN's there.  Um, I think CNN was there.  A couple of all these, uh, other, uh, sports and news organizations.  They walked off the stage and left.  So TV's sitting there waiting to talk to these people and they're gone.  So The Rock comes out.  He does a, a couple.  Why was The Rock there?  Because he's now going to be part of WrestleMania 29.  All right.  I might have to go to WrestleMania.  So this is the third year in a row that The Rock is part of WrestleMania. 
[03:42:00]  I've never been to a WrestleMania.  It's exciting.  Yeah.  Why?  I kind of, I kind of, I kind of, I don't know.  Why is it exciting?  Because it's an event.  It's overdramatic.  There's way too much pomp and circumstance.  Yeah, I've been to a...  That it just becomes, now you're enjoying it because there's just too much going on.  Let me ask a question because I've, I remember wrestling and the, when it was,  I mean, you know, I know it goes through its ebbs and flows all the time, but, and it's  very cyclical, but I remember, you know, the mid to late nineties, it was huge.  There, you know, wrestling was selling out arenas.  Like you could easily have a Raw show at Madison Square Garden every week. 
[03:42:30]  Flipping through the channels lately, you know, you get, you come across Raw or whatever  wrestling is on and the venues are a lot smaller than they used to be.  And it's quite noticeable.  There's some real dark upper decks.  Yeah.  And, and, you know, it looks like it's the first level of wherever they're playing.  And so my question is, uh, because WrestleMania is at Giants fucking stadium, that's a big  ass place.  Can they actually sell?  Yeah, they'll sell it out.  They sold out.  They're playing in Miami.  In Miami.  And it's 80,000 people.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  And the, the, WrestleMania is like the Superbowl.  Like people just go. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  Like they did, they did 71,000 last year.  And it's not just America and Canada anymore.  Like they'll give you the statistics of who came from around the world.  And you're getting people from, from, uh, Asia and Europe that are making up huge percentages  of the audience now more than almost as much as Americans.  I just wanted to see, I mean, that's a pretty, to me, from an outsider looking in, it looks  like a ballsy move to book through giant, uh, to book giant stadium when it looks, when,  when they, when they're definitely not in the same venues that they were 10 years ago.  Well, they're doing, uh, what was it called?  Sunfield in Miami, right? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  Sunlife.  Sunlife.  Sunlife.  They're doing that.  They were looking at, uh, the Cowboy Stadium, but it wasn't available for the next two years.  It was in Arizona, right?  Um, they did like 71,000.  Two years ago.  Yeah, they did like 71,000 then.  Yeah.  And that was an outdoor event.  Yeah.  This is the, the, the one at Medlife Stadium is interesting cause it's an outdoor event,  but it's still, that's exactly the first time they're doing it just like the Superbowl  in the Northern area where it could be really cold.  It's snow.  It could.  Or as Hope told me that there's no winter in April. 
[03:44:00]  Okay.  But that's not true.  Yeah, I know.  I said seasons don't really, they're not based on months anymore.  There's been snow.  We had a blizzard on Halloween.  Yeah.  But, uh, so the, the press conference went well except for those guys leaving and The  Rock did a couple of, uh, uh, uh, short TV interviews and then he turned around and  it looked like he was just going to do something.  And after a few minutes, this publicist came running over to the hire of publicists with  WWE.  The Rock left.  And they're like, what do you mean The Rock left?  And he's like, yeah, he just left.  So he didn't stay around to do anything either. 
[03:44:30]  Did anyone stay around?  Uh, W, well, WWE superstars were there, but, uh, doink.  Really?  Who was there?  We'll just sit up.  Uh, so, all right, look.  Cena, Sheamus, Mark Henry, all, no, all the current stuff was there.  So what's the big thing?  What was the big, what's the big thing?  They're bringing it to MetLife, uh, uh, yeah, for next year, um, at, at the stadium.  It's an outdoor event, uh, in the Northern area, April 7th.  That's early in April. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  April 7th, 2013.  And what's, like, the big match?  They haven't, they didn't state a match this time.  Last year, when they promoted.  That's ridiculous.  WrestleMania 28, during WrestleMania 27, that The Rock and Cena were going to be the big  match.  There was no match announced this year, other than The Rock will be part of it in some  faction.  So I guess, outside of it coming to, uh, the New York, New Jersey area, this is, uh, that  was the other big news.  Stone Cold?  I'm sure they'll work him in somehow.  Yeah, Rock Stone Cold.  Did anybody do any grown-up things yesterday? 
[03:45:30]  Um, well, you know.  Just wondering.  Eric and Sam, though, they're like the pimps.  So I'm guessing from 6 to 10, there was fart and shit jokes, and then you went to a wrestling  press conference.  Yes.  And Roland ate, uh, the free buffet in the bar.  Yeah, but, uh, and then still asked if we're going to Chili's afterwards.  And you went home and, uh, played video games and refrosted your tips.  Oh, I wish.  Eric and Sam were like pimps there.  They took them everywhere.  Who took who everywhere?  The WWE people, they love them.  Well, yeah.  Nobody blows them on radio more than Eric and Sam. 
[03:46:00]  They should love them.  They've done great things for that company.  It was fun, but we got to walk out near the field and everything.  Yeah, that's cool.  I've never been to that place.  It's amazing.  Yeah, it's new.  All right.  So there you go.  There's wrestling for you.  See, Sam?  We still did wrestling talk.  Sam will have audio and then he can talk about his, uh, his lunch with Mark Henry when he returns.  Spoiler.  Yes.  I don't know.  I just can't be.  I'd go eat lunch with Mark Henry.  Yeah, he ditched us.  He's like, I got to get my bag from your car.  And then he left.  Into Sylvia's.  That's great. 
[03:46:30]  I would totally go to lunch with Mark Henry.  Yeah.  I think I would too.  You know you would.  You would go to lunch with D'Lo Brown.  Sylvia's was a little.  A little what?  A little farther north than I go.  Then you go where?  In New York City.  I'd like to go to lunch with Alex Wright.  Okay.  That's just me.  Where would you go?  Ah, nice German place.  You know, he probably likes that stuff.  I told that story, right?  When, uh, I went, but this is back in the day when I was, uh, when I was still a WCW fan.  And, uh, it was great when they went to the Nassau Coliseum because I learned early on that, like, right after the last match, like, if you just ran across the street to the, whatever it is, like the Marriott. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's where everybody stays.  That's where all the wrestlers stay because it's the only fucking, you know, big hotel that's around.  Um, so as long as you just wait around, you'll just see the wrestlers start showing up.  And, uh, so sure enough, I gave that a whirl and, uh, started meeting all these wrestlers.  And, uh, the funniest thing I had seen that night was Alex Wright.  Uh, and you guys remember Billy Kidman?  I don't know if he's still around, but, uh, he was a pretty cool dude. 
[03:47:30]  He's not active.  And, uh, it was the strangest thing to see Alex Wright, uh, basically flirting and trying to hit on Billy Kidman, trying to get him to go to see the water boy.  And now it's like, he's like, what are you doing tomorrow?  Maybe you want to see it tomorrow?  And, and, and Billy Kidman's like, I don't know.  I got, I might got things to do.  Well, maybe Saturday.  You want to go see it Saturday?  It was just all happening right in front of me.  And I'm like, oh my God, Alex Wright is asking Billy Kidman on a date right in front of me.  This is so sweet.  But I always went down there after, uh, wrestling stuff.  And it was cool because I got to meet, like, uh, the giant. 
[03:48:00]  I got to meet Goldberg.  Uh.  Did you get any photos?  No, I never did.  It was just more about, it was just more about the atmosphere.  It was just fun, you know?  Uh, uh, K-Dog.  He was, he was fun.  Uh.  Conan.  Conan, yeah.  Uh, damn, who else was there?  Uh, fuck.  Oh, uh, uh, how could I forget?  Razor, Razor Ramon.  Scott Hall.  Was he drunk?  Oh, of course.  Oh, he was fucking hammered.  And he was wheeling, he was wheeling his, uh, his, his.  They all wheeled those little suitcases.  It's so funny to me because you see these guys and, and to you, you, you watch them  on TV every week.  To you, there are these huge stars. 
[03:48:30]  You, you know, they're, they're these guys that are in your mind like, wow, they get  paid to fucking wrestle.  They're in shape.  They're athletes.  And then to see them just wheeling their own shit into the hotel, like, they don't even  have somebody to just help them out with their bag.  It's just like, fuck, dude.  Some of them have a bigger suitcase that they leave in the room and take the little suitcase  out of the bigger suitcase because that has, like, their meds and their outfit and  whatever else they got to bring to the arena.  I feel so bad because Scott Hall, I was just so obnoxious to him.  Uh, I, I just, I, he was just trying to, you know, he's wrestling.  He's, he's an alcoholic.  He's brought, just trying to go upstairs so he can read the minibar. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And I just got to get into his face and he used to do that, that jumping and pointing  at himself thing.  Yeah.  And I'm just getting, yeah, I'm like, ah, I'm the bad guy.  And he's just.  Did you do that for him?  Of course.  Oh, that's awesome.  And then they went to the next town and some idiot did it there.  And then the next town.  Yeah.  But you know what, you know why it was okay?  Because I was like 16 years old.  So I think it's okay.  Like if I did it now, you know, like I'm balding and I got a beard and I'm like, ah, I remember  you.  It would be funnier if you did it now.  Because he can't walk. 
[03:49:30]  He can't focus.  This guy just runs up and goes, hey.  Did you see that fucking, I don't know.  The ESPN piece?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  What's the name of that show?  Outside the Lines.  Oh, fuck, man.  That was tragic watching that one.  It was so depressing.  I haven't seen him in like a sober interview in like forever.  And there was, for those of you who don't know what Danny's talking about.  No, I'm sorry.  It was a piece about Scott Hall, Razor Ramon, currently where he was fighting alcoholism  so bad to the point where that video that got out where he was forced into the ring when 
[03:50:00]  he just shouldn't have been out there.  They talked a little bit about that and that he had a son that he's been estranged from for  so many years.  And it was kind of an attempt to get them back together.  Yeah.  And I think at the end of that piece, I think they were together.  They were together.  But there was a follow-up story where I think it was like two or three weeks later, the  son said, I don't want to see him ever again.  I mean, you know, everybody praised.  A lot of people saw that piece because it was on ESPN.  Yeah, dude.  And it got a lot of praise.  Because it was great.  And, you know, a lot of people, they watch The Wrestler and they go, oh, that's a great 
[03:50:30]  movie.  And that was based on a real, you know, Jake the Snake Roberts, I do believe.  It's a combination of people, but mostly Jake the Snake.  But I mean, that fucking Scott Hall piece was every bit as good as that whole movie, The  Wrestler.  Like, it was very, like, dude, there was no excitement to it.  It was very real and very sad.  Watching The Wrestler was kind of like almost watching, like, The King of Kong in a way,  where it was a documentary.  It was a little fabricated. 
[03:51:00]  But for the most part, that's what went down.  And that's a million people's story.  It wasn't like, oh, here's the story of X Wrestler.  Here's the story of probably a bunch of wrestlers.  And this fucking Scott Hall thing.  Dude, it's great.  You should see it.  That Scott Hall thing was that movie and then some.  You never saw The Wrestler?  No.  All right.  Danny saw it.  Let me ask you a question.  What was the most depressing part of The Wrestler?  Honestly, I'll tell you.  And because this is something that I think everybody could identify with.  When he gets that job at the deli, at the supermarket. 
[03:51:30]  Spoiler.  And, well, fuck you.  You should have seen it.  This thing's been out for three hours.  Now I know if he goes into a deli, I know what's going to happen.  And it's not the fact that he's got the gig.  It's not the fact that he's got the gig.  It's not like, oh, here was this guy and now he's got to work the deli.  It was the fact that he was trying really hard to enjoy his job at the deli.  And it was just like, you know what I'm saying?  And he was like, hey, what do you need, miss?  And he was just trying to, just whatever he could do to forget about the fact that he was slicing bologna meat for people. 
[03:52:00]  And he can get through the day like that.  I thought you, we'll get to that in a second.  But I thought you were going to say where he, again, he was at the deli counter.  He was trying to make the best of it.  And like I said, it wasn't somebody recognized him.  Well, that was tough, too.  But that was more of a scene that was force fed to you.  That was like, here's why you should feel bad for him.  Like, really feel bad for him.  But I felt that that was more of a, like, a between the lines kind of situation where, like, he was just like, because everybody does that.  Everybody gets to a point or they had a job where they couldn't stand it.  And it was like, whatever I have to believe in my head to make this day go by. 
[03:52:30]  And he was just having fun with himself, playing little games and spinning around and, you know, playing with the meat.  And that was his thing to just make his miserable life a little more bearable for the day.  And that's what got me.  The other, that's definitely one of them.  The other part, or at least for me, was when he's back in his trailer and he's playing his old video game.  Oh, yeah.  And it looks like, for those of you who don't know, in the 80s, there was an old WWF game for Nintendo.  And, you know, cheesy 8-bit thing. 
[03:53:00]  And he's back in there and he's playing his old game.  It's based on him.  And then he's asking the kid.  He's like, oh, you want to play that old wrestling?  And the kid's like, nah.  That game had, like, four people in it.  Are you talking about the one, was that the one where you were, there was Macho Man, Hulk Hogan, and that was it.  And there was, like, power-ups that would, like, go, bounce across the ring.  Like, if you were Hulk Hogan, the gold cross would bounce apart.  And I hated it.  That game sucked so bad because it was trying to be the arcade version.  And, like, WWF Superstars, the arcade version?  It was good.  That was a good game for back in the day. 
[03:53:30]  They didn't have the technology to cross it to the home console from what they had in the actual arcade.  Isn't that a crazy thing, though, that, like, kids that are growing up, like, even kids as old, and my brother is, like, 18, I guess, 18, 19.  Like, even him, he doesn't know what it's like to go to an arcade with a roll of quarters and fucking have fun for a whole afternoon.  He'll never know that.  They're never going to know what it's like.  To beat a game.  No, to not even that, but to go somewhere where you had to go because the shit there was better than what you had at your house.  At your house.  And it's not like that anymore.  Now you go to arcades, and it's like, I can't even fucking see this shit because it's all tube. 
[03:54:00]  Everything's standard definition on some fuzzy tube that's been turned on for the last four and a half years consecutively.  And it looks like shit.  Oh, yeah, you see all the ghosting and the shadowing, and the images burnt into the screen.  And you see that at Donkey Kong and Pac-Man.  And you know what?  And Donkey Kong and Pac-Man, those are the only fucking games that are a quarter.  You know?  You go to half of these games, they're not even...  Everything's like a dollar.  Yeah, and, like, even when I was growing up, shit wasn't a quarter anymore.  It was, like, 50 cents.  But now games are, like, legitimately 75 cents to $1.50.  And it's like, why?  Why am I going to go and play Daytona USA, which is easily a 15-year-old game at Dave & Buster's? 
[03:54:30]  Why am I going to shove $2 worth of quarters in there?  My buddy Eric and I beat, like, one of those Marvel Capcom games.  Yeah, we did.  Like, one year on my birthday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  His name's Eric.  But, like, there's no better feeling than just, like, wasting, you know, $30 on beating a game.  There's just no arcades anymore, and, like, like...  And the ones that are there are just so ridiculous.  Yeah, like, huge, dude.  With those huge, human-sized, grab-a-doll. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, man.  Like, Dave & Buster's is not an arcade.  Like, I remember being able to go to an arcade where you couldn't even...  You go with your friends, and you gotta scream at each other, because it was so fucking loud,  and it was full smoke.  And there would be lines to play certain games.  And you would have to put your quarters up on a machine to get your necks, and, like,  all the, all the, all the, what do you call it, like, where the joystick area is and the  buttons, it was all burnt up with cigarette fucking burns.  Or sticky from people spilling soda or french fries.  And, like, anywhere there was an arcade machine in your neighborhood, like, maybe there wasn't  a whole arcade, but maybe, like, the video store had, like, that one Mortal Kombat machine. 
[03:55:30]  Or, like, a pizza place.  Yeah, and, like, you would flock there, and, like...  Double Dragon.  It bugs me out that just kids growing up, like, they're never, ever, ever, ever gonna  know that stuff.  Ever.  There was a pizza place near me that had Double Dragon that I used to go and play all the  time, because it wasn't...  It was better than the home console version.  Yeah, we lived in a neighborhood, or a town in New Jersey, where, and if you're from New  Jersey, you know that there's, like...  You're from New Jersey?!  Ah!  Ah!  There was, like, ten pizza places in each town, and we would base, like, what pizza place  we'd go to based on, like, what arcade game they had, because it was, like, 
[03:56:00]  all right, that one's better.  And now we would do the same thing, too.  Because it was, like, well, do we want to have a full-on arcade day at Super A?  Or we could just head up to Hollywood Nights, and, I mean, it's good enough, because they  got NBA Jam Mortal Kombat.  I mean, we're just gonna play NBA Jam Mortal Kombat at the arcade, so let's just save ourselves  the trip.  I know the cheat code that gets the president to play on the...  Oh, yeah, I remember that, too.  You had the big head code.  You had mentioned about the games...  Oh, the big head.  Yeah.  Those are great.  And there was always that asshole that was, like, yeah, dude, I know the Jordan code, but 
[03:56:30]  I can't tell you.  There's a Jordan code.  Yeah, it's really secret.  You know, the guys at EA know.  All right, you do it, then.  Let me see you play the guy.  No, I can't do it.  You gotta go counterclockwise, like, five times.  It's really hard to do.  It's really hard.  You gotta hit turbo and jump.  You were saying about how back then the arcade games were better than what was on the console.  I used to play Punch-Out, the original Punch-Out.  Fuck yeah, man.  In the arcade.  Sure.  And then I heard Punch-Out was coming to Nintendo, and Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, which is still  a great game, but it was nothing like the Punch-Out that was in the arcade. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, because, like, those dedicated machines like that, like, that whole thing, it was  just like a big, and by that time, you know, there was probably more processing power in  one of those arcade machines than one of, like, the first flight to the moon, you know what  I'm saying?  Yeah.  So, like, that whole machine was just there and made specifically to play that one game.  And then you try to make something on Nintendo, and, you know, the frame rate's not the same,  I mean, you can't.  But those old games, man, like, no one gives those games credit.  They were, for the graphics not being quite there, they were remarkably smooth.  They are.  Compared to what you would play at home. 
[03:57:30]  Because there were games like, well, Punch-Out and Double Dragon.  Like, it wasn't this jittery, it might have looked like shit, but it definitely wasn't  like a jittery mess like a lot of the stuff at home was.  There was no pixelation, there was no problem winning the store.  Storyboard scrolling as you're going.  But you said, like, Punch-Out and Double Dragon, a couple other things.  But, like, probably towards the end of the 80s with the Simpsons game, Ninja Turtles,  all that stuff, they were great arcade games, but the console games were still total shit.  That Simpsons game's coming to Xbox Live.  It's already out.  Oh, that was a great one, that four-player Simpsons game. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, that was pretty cool, man.  Didn't the original Punch-Out have the two controllers where you could punch them like that?  And it was a dual screen.  It was also a dual screen as well.  Up and down.  Yeah, people forget that stuff.  And you were that just see-through, like, translucent green mesh.  Yeah.  That was a fucking great game, man.  And it was hard as fuck.  Hard as fuck.  People nowadays, it's like, you know, they just blow through games.  But even back in the day, man, like, trying to beat Bald Bull on that fucking old-school  dual screen punch-out, man.  Just to get him in the stomach.  Yeah, but I think these companies realize that those games still resonate with people 
[03:58:30]  because there's no other reason that they're coming out on Xbox Live, you know, 15, 20 years  later.  Sure.  I mean, I'm amazed that a game like Tetris, like, you know how much money Tetris has  made?  A lot.  Like, and people buy it.  Like, people buy Tetris probably seven or eight times.  I mean, if you're 30, you've probably paid for Tetris multiple times.  You bought it on Nintendo, Game Boy, your iPhones.  Multiple times.  Absolutely.  I used to play it on the Game Boy, yeah.  I mean, it's amazing what people, and like, I have a bunch of retro games for free, and  it's like, if, you know, if one came out for the iPhone that was easy to use and, like, 
[03:59:00]  you know, it wasn't a pain in the ass to play, I'd probably fucking buy it, you know, just  because of the convenience factor.  But, damn, those games were good, man.  I mean, I wish that, what's the new arcade?  Where do kids go to hang out and do this?  Well, you still, you go to those arcades, but the games have just evolved, you know?  Now it's, you know, you put on glasses.  I mean, at least pinball.  I mean, do the kids out there still play the pinball?  I don't know.  They still skee-ball.  Well, skee-ball's a classic.  Yeah. 
[03:59:30]  But, I mean, like, you'll go to Dave & Buster's in Times Square, and, like, half the games  are shooting games now, you know?  Whereas, like, it used to be that one shooting game.  What was it called?  Wild Gunman?  No, not Wild.  Police Enforcers?  You have to use your hands.  No, what was that, zombie game?  Oh, Area 51.  Area 51.  Was that it?  Absolutely.  Okay, yeah.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  So, um, House of the Dead?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, like, two or something?  The one with the fucking, uh, with the pedal.  And you could take cover. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  But it used to just be that one, you know?  And now it's, like, half the games are just shooting games that are just generic.  Yeah, but look at, like, that big Buck Hunter game.  Like, you know, that's cool at the bar when you're fucking half-hammered.  But, like, that's no, like, that sucks.  You could get better than that at home.  So, it's like, why don't I just spend the 50 bucks and buy the Xbox thing?  Yeah, but there's no, like, video games now because everybody just cares about tickets.  You know?  Like, how many tickets are you going to get?  Anyway, let me talk to Marcos because he remembers back in the day.  Marcos in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas? 
[04:00:30]  I used to go to this arcade spot.  Noah's Arcade?  Yeah, an arcade spot.  And it was a crowd of people in front of one machine.  You're on your tippy-toes just to get a glimpse of Mortal Kombat 2 when it had just come out.  And there was this little Asian kid that he already knew the fatalities.  Every arcade and little Asian kid.  It was insane.  Luke Kang's Dragon Fatality was crazy.  And then they would know, not only would they know every fatality, but they knew every friendship and babality.  And, like, they would fucking school you because, like, they wouldn't have to, like, think or remember shit. 
[04:01:00]  And it was, like, some Cesar Millan shit where they would just stare you in the face and do a babality.  And then you were like, fuck, this kid's good.  And then when it was your turn, you didn't even want to play because you knew that this kid was just going to kick your ass.  One time, I fucking, my arcade, like, they had a lot of great games, but they never did anything fun.  And they didn't do contests.  So I would always draw up, like, plans for, like, contests and give them to, like, the owner.  You know, just because I had nothing to do with myself.  So, you know, they organized, like, some, like, Virtua.  Yeah, it was like a league, exactly.  So, like, they organized some, like, Virtua fight. 
[04:01:30]  Remember Virtua fight?  Like, Polygon fight.  Virtua fight.  And I'm like, yeah, this is going to be great.  And I spent, like, you know, 50 bucks leading up to this big tournament.  Like, I'm going to kick everyone's ass, right?  There was a winner's bracket and a loser's bracket.  My first match in the winner's bracket, I get my ass kicked by some Asian kid.  And then my first match in the loser's bracket, I get my ass kicked by some Asian kid.  It was my idea, and I just went home.  I didn't even stick around to see the finish.  But he brings up a great point.  That Mortal Kombat 2, when that came out, that was an event at arcade places.  Well, you would wait in line to play that game. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, but even the Street Fighters, like, I mean, it got to be overkill.  But when Street Fighter Championship Edition came out.  Another game that was better in the arcade to start than it was on the console.  Oh, well, yeah, because that's when, I guess, I mean, the crossover had started.  But, you know, because, like, it wasn't a bad, I mean, it wasn't a bad game, Street Fighter, for Super Nintendo.  No, it wasn't.  But I'm saying, if you played in the arcade, it was awesome in the arcade.  Absolutely was.  And remember when they would have those hacked, those modded boards where, like, that's how big that game got. 
[04:02:30]  It got so big that people wanted more Street Fighter.  And Capcom couldn't put out enough Street Fighter to quench the thirst for Street Fighter.  When that first Street Fighter came out that had.  Will you shut up?  We're talking here.  Sorry, man.  I'm like, you know, Marcos, hang on a sec.  After the first Street Fighter that came out after where they had the new characters for the first time.  Yeah, Super Street Fighter 2.  Yeah, no, no, the next one where they had, like, Cammy and the Indian guy and all that shit.  I know my Street Fighter motherfucker. 
[04:03:00]  Was that, that was Super Street Fighter 2?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that one.  That one was, like, Mortal Kombat 2.  Same type of thing.  Fucking flying out the door.  What were you saying, Marcos?  No, I was going to say, you know how many arguments and fights I started with?  What's the matter?  Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat.  Yeah, no, I remember it, man.  I mean, that was, like, a big, that was a really big pop culture thing for a lot of us that are the same age.  Did your local arcades or even you, Travis, did they used to have tournaments that they would bring special machines in just to do tournaments?  No, I don't remember that stuff.  All right, because the mall near me used to put these flyers out and they would have a big tournament for, like, 
[04:03:30]  I remember one of them was Donkey Kong something, and they just brought in, like, 12 different machines and closed off half the arcade just to have a tournament there.  You're thinking of King of Khan.  No, no, no, no, no.  It was weird.  I was in San Francisco over the summer for some vacation, and there was, like, I heard that there was, like, this, like, retro, like, arcade museum.  And I'm like, oh, that'll be really cool.  Let me go check that out.  And I went down there, but it was, like, it was retro more than I wanted it to be.  Like, it was, like, legitimately old school, like, where it was, like, rock'em, sock'em, steel robots, like, you know, battling it out. 
[04:04:00]  You had to put, like, your one penny in, and then you could play it.  You were hoping to see some Mortal Kombat.  Yeah, well, I was hoping for, like, an original Mortal Kombat machine and, like, original Pac-Man machine and just shit like that.  But, like, they went way, way deep.  But it was still pretty cool.  I definitely recommend it to anybody out there.  I think it's at the Fisherman's Wharf.  All right.  In San Franny.  Look at all those phone calls.  Yeah, let's take some.  I guess everybody likes to play video games.  Yeah, I mean.  I mean, and remembers all the old shit.  Jeez, I don't even know where to go.  Let's go to Paul. 
[04:04:30]  Paul, Texas, right?  Yes, sir.  What's the, what's up?  Down in Texas, man, dude, it's, you know, to go to an arcade, you had to go to the mall.  You know, back when I lived in Oklahoma, you know, you had card shops back in the day where you go buy baseball cards and all that kind of crap.  But, you know.  Are those still around?  Card shops?  Yeah.  Yeah, dude, you know what?  There's a few in my neighborhood, and every time I pass, there's a lot of local businesses I do this to, but especially the card places.  You drive by, and you go, how the fuck do they stay in business?  Like, who's going into a card shop?  And even the people that do, how is that enough for this guy to not only pay his rent, but decide, yeah, I'm going to stay open another month. 
[04:05:00]  Because that really died in, like, the mid to late 90s.  I mean, there's a guy.  When there were too many different baseball cards to collect.  No one cared anymore.  Yeah, when the bubble just burst, and everybody just stopped collecting.  Yeah, and, like, no one really collects, like, those, like, comic book busts.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, how do you fucking sell enough of those to perpetuate your business?  I just don't understand.  Yeah.  I mean, especially when everything's available online.  That's the thing, like, back in Oklahoma, whenever you live there, you know, we all go to the card shop, and we spend, you know, 15 bucks and quarters, and, you know, have, like, tournaments and Mortal Kombat and crap like that. 
[04:05:30]  But when it came to Texas, you know, there's, like, no card shops or arcades around.  You have to go to the mall to play all that crap, and it was always, you know, flooded full of, like, gangbangers and shit like that.  In Oklahoma?  In Oklahoma.  Dude, card shops, I would go, I would get my allowance and just go.  It was horrible.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, I mean, I didn't, like, I didn't go to the card shop, but I did have a comic shop.  That was my thing.  And they had cards, too, but it was more of a comic shop than a card place.  I had a card shop that was just sports cards, and then they would do, you know, like, the Marvel cards when Marvel would do that. 
[04:06:00]  It's because, oh, my God, it was such a thing.  And then I had a comic book shop that they kind of, you know, just did all that, all the, you know, like, just any comic that you wanted.  Yeah.  They would compete with each other all the time.  I mean, shit was so big back in the day.  Like, I had.  But that's where you went.  Yeah, I mean, look, and, dude, everyone was into it, too.  Like, I remember at my, like, comic card store, I had, they would let you have what they would refer to as a file. 
[04:06:30]  And you had a number.  Oh, right, right, yeah.  And you could fucking subscribe.  And what they would do, because comic collecting was so fucking ridiculous, they would pull, you would tell them what comics you want.  I want Spider-Man.  I want Iron Man.  I want this.  I want that.  I want this.  And then they would pull them all, and they would put them in your little folder.  And then as you fucking forgot about that, it would pile up.  And then all of a sudden, you'd be like, oh, shit, my file at the comic book store.  And then you'd call and be like, hey, I'm going to come in, pick up my file.  How much is that?  And they'd be like, oh, let me see.  $77.  And then now you're a 14-year-old kid, and you're like, fuck, I'm in the hole for $77 worth of comic books. 
[04:07:00]  My comic book store was called Cards and Comics.  I just remembered that.  The one in my.  Good one.  How'd they ever come up with that name?  The one by me was called Heroes on the Half Shelf.  It was so stupid.  I'll give them a free plug.  There's, like, a collectible place in my neighborhood.  It's called Fantastic Toyage.  It's terrible.  Remember that story you were telling me, Travis, about going to the card store, and you spent $200 on that Collie Stramski car with the sideburns? 
[04:07:30]  Yes.  Anyway, I want to take this guy real quick, because I hope this is good.  Justin in Oklahoma.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Do you guys remember the Mortal Kombat in the arcade that had smoke in it?  Yeah.  Okay, well, I was really good at the combinations, and I could cheese people over and over and over, and there was this guy.  We actually had one in our school, and I was a freshman.  He was a senior, and I kept cheesing him and beating him, and that was the first fist fight I ever got into.  I kept cheesing him and beating him, and finally turned around and punched me in the face.  You know what?  It's so funny that you mentioned cheesing, because I remember that shit. 
[04:08:00]  Like, you remember how fucking, like, you would get pissed off when, like, maybe you had a run on your machine, and you were fucking nailing people, like, four or five deep.  And then some motherfucker would, like, he would come in, like, you're playing Street Fighter, and he would be like M. Bison and just do that cheesy fucking go side to side with the flame and shit back and forth.  And he would just kick the piss out of you, and then you had to walk away from the machine like, I wish I could just fucking take you to the ground and step on your dick.  Do you remember Chun-Li on Street Fighter when you could go upside down with the scissor kicks all the way up to the whole screen?  Yes. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah, well, yeah, yeah.  I mean, that was pretty much the same thing as that M. Bison attack.  My favorite was Blanca when you just did the electricity thing, and when they went to punch you, everyone just got shot.  Well, yeah, but you know what?  You've got to smarten up, stupid, and if you just jab him, just get in with that little jab.  That'll fucking stop the whole thing from happening, man.  You've got to get in there tight.  I know we're running out of time, but real quick, I forgot about fights in the arcade.  The mall near me was one of the first to adapt, like, laser tag into the mall.  But this was with Photon.  It wasn't even, like, the real ones.  Photon with the red and green helmets.  Yep. 
[04:09:00]  And kids just used to beat the shit out of each other during and after the fight because they were saying somebody was cheating or my light thing wasn't working.  There was brawls.  People were just beating each other up with the equipment.  Yeah, that's the best.  Nothing like a good old arcade fight.  Video games bring violence.  They're right.  I know.  It was great.  I missed that shit, man.  That was, like, a whole other time.  It was a whole other time.  Yeah, that day's over.  Yeah, like, any fucking excuse.  Like, if I had 10 minutes or 15 minutes, me and my friend, we used to live in an apartment building.  Like, if we were doing our laundry together or some shit and we had to, like, wait in between the cycle, it's like, ah, fuck it, let's run to the arcade and fucking play games. 
[04:09:30]  There's a lot of shit that died with our generation.  I'm sure every generation says that, but...  I'm sure we all sound like old men to anybody out there.  I know we do.  We're just pying for...  Waxing fantastic about the good old days.  Now you just have eight-year-olds on multiplayer calling you the N-word.  Yeah, now you're just sitting at home doing the exact same thing.  I know.  Well, I guess this has been after ONA Live minus Sam Roberts, but this has been Eric Nagel.  It's been Travis Teft.  It's been myself, Danny Ross, and all of our interns and everybody.  And we won't see you Monday because it's a company holiday.  So we'll see you Tuesday.  Yeah.  Oh, you know what?
