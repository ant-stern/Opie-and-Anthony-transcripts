<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Joe Rogan, Rich Voss, and Ari Shafir filling in for the absent Opie and Anthony.  The show featured the band Octane as studio guests, whose music was heavily played and praised. The hosts discussed the challenges faced by musicians versus comedians, using humorous and often crude analogies to illustrate the competitive entertainment industry. They touched upon their experiences with difficult audiences, club owners, and the absurdities of comedy competitions like "Last Comic Standing."  A substantial portion of the show focused on a debate about drug legalization, particularly marijuana, its hypocrisy compared to other substances, and the potential consequences of legalization, advocating for education and personal responsibility. The hosts also discussed hecklers and the idea for a "Punk'd"-style show featuring hecklers ruining comedy sets, as well as the career of comedian Brian Holtzman.

Following this segment, Joe Rogan appeared as a guest on a separate portion of the show. The conversation started with a discussion about the smell of cigarettes and segued into a humorous anecdote about blowjobs.  Rogan detailed his experiences with medical marijuana in California, contrasting it with stricter regulations in other states, and briefly touched upon the historical use of anti-Semitic propaganda.  A female caller suggested he run for president, a suggestion he jokingly dismissed.  The conversation then turned to Rogan's UFC expertise, covering fighting styles, training, the commercialization of the UFC, and the dangers of unregulated fighting, referencing "Felony Fights" videos.  He also promoted his new show, *Inside the UFC*, and a new TV pilot.

A subsequent segment featured a call-in section interspersed with host discussions. A caller shared a racist golf story from West Virginia, followed by another callerâ€™s question about accessing race-related videos online, leading to a discussion about a Christian parody website.  The hosts answered listener questions about Rogan's UFC commentary and stand-up shows, including ticket giveaways. The conversation then shifted to the hosts' personal lives, including their clothing preferences and home renovations, characterized by frequent offensive language, racial slurs, and misogynistic comments.  A lengthy segment involved the hosts and Patrice O'Neal guessing the themes of top 10 country songs based on their titles, resulting in sexually explicit and vulgar interpretations of songs like "My Wish" and "Want To," with jokes about rape, infidelity, and drug use. A caller challenged the hosts' anger and bitterness, prompting further offensive responses.

Another segment involved the hosts guessing the meanings of country songs like "Every Mile a Memory," "I Loved Her First," and "Would You Go With Me," using crude humor and frequent racial slurs.  This section included lengthy conversations with several callers, focusing on racial dynamics, socioeconomic differences within the Black community, and cultural observations, with candid, vulgar, and sometimes confrontational dialogue. The Arnold Schwarzenegger impression was mentioned.

Finally, a segment featuring comedian Patrice O'Neal as a guest covered aggressive driving, drug slang, including a dangerous combination involving embalming fluid,  and contrasted the appearances and realities of Baltimore and D.C. projects.  The conversation included discussions of racial stereotypes, white guilt, and racial perceptions in urban environments.  Patrice discussed his changing lifestyle and views, referencing his homeownership and financial responsibility.  Dane Cook called in, leading to a discussion about his rise to fame and comedic persona, contrasting his style with Patrice's.  Patrice shared his philosophy on comedy and fame. Dave Attell also called in, briefly mentioning his near involvement in *Transformers*.  Throughout this segment, there was frequent use of offensive language and discussions of controversial topics.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hello, this is Jim Norton, Jim Norton on Twitter, MySpace.com, Jim Norton, Jim Norton  on Facebook. You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony. Today's show is hosted 
[00:00:30]  by Club Soda Kenny, a real no-talent pile of shit.  Why, thank you, Mr. Norton. Season's greetings, and welcome to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am your host, Club Soda Kenny, also known as CSK, and affectionately referred to as  Clubby. In this first segment, O&A left early, leaving Joe Rogan, Rich Voss, and Ari Shafir 
[00:01:00]  to host the show on their own. And then what happened?  Who the fuck is listening? To The Worst. Who's fucking listening? To The Worst. The Worst  of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:01:30]  All right, this is The Opie and Anthony Show, except no Opie, no Anthony. It's me, Joe Rogan,  Rich Voss, and Ari Shafir, a.k.a. The Amazing Racist. And we also have Octane here with us,  and we're going to try to play, Octane played on the walkover. We're going to try to play  this enemy song. That's the first track. Play that shit. You know what sucks?  Not acoustic. When you get a band that good, how hard it is. Like, comics can get on anywhere  almost at this point. If you've got four friends, you can get on anywhere. And then they're delusional 
[00:02:00]  because they bring their friends. Then their friends laugh. And, you know, they're too uncomfortable  to say, you're funny, you're great. And that, you know, perpetuates it. Don't go on stage  again and keep coming. Yeah. And they're horrible. Then you get a band as good as this that, you  know, they can't get signed. It's just, it's. Well, not only that, bands are way harder because  you can go on stage. You can get in a fight with Bonnie. You can do whatever. You can just  go on stage. Yeah. But they have to fucking get along with each other. They hang out with each  other. They have to rehearse. You don't rehearse. You write your fucking jokes. You write your shit. 
[00:02:30]  You've come up with a funny idea. You write it on a napkin. You try it out at an open mic  night. You know what I mean? They have to fucking work. And you can't just go on tonight when  you feel like it. Right. You've got to plan it way, way in advance. Yeah. You can't have  an idea for a song. I'll have an idea for a joke. Just show up at the comedy store and  just ramble, you know, and just start talking about something. And the ideas will come out  of it. But, you know, that's a lot of fucking work. Well, and also, too, as a comic, like  we're not, either a comedy club is going to do comedy, like a place where a band plays. 
[00:03:00]  They say, well, you know, we're not getting a band. We're going to get a DJ. We're going  to get karaoke. We're going to fill it in with, you know, so it's hard for them to find  a venue, too. And even if they do get a venue, people don't want them to play their own shit.  They want them to play, you know, you do U2. You know, they want to play, like even coming  over here. Opie wanted them to play covers and they played their own shit. And I'm glad  they did. This is a song. Let's play this enemy song. This is a song that they played  first. This fucking song rocks, man. This really got me.  I got a lot of, I got a lot of anchors. I'll waste. 
[00:03:30]  It's not another time. No time. No time. No time to leave. 
[00:04:00]  My enemies, enemies are the closest friends I keep. Jesus warned me twice today. Each  time I pray, make love not end. My enemies, enemies are the closest friends I keep.  Jesus warned me twice today. Each time I pray, make love not end.  I got a lot of, I got a lot of reason for being denied. Don't be seeing time. No time. No time. 
[00:04:30]  My enemies, enemies are the closest friends I keep. Jesus warned me twice today. Each time I pray, make love not end. My enemies, enemies are the closest friends I keep. 
[00:05:00]  Jesus warned me twice today  Each time I pray, make love not end  My enemies, enemies  All the closest friends I keep  Jesus warned me twice today  Each time I pray, make love not end  Ain't got no time 
[00:05:30]  Ain't got no time  I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta  Live like a leading guard in a leading time  No time, no time to resist 
[00:06:00]  My enemies, enemies  All the closest friends I keep  Jesus warned me twice today  Each time I pray, make love not end  My enemies, enemies  All the closest friends I keep  Jesus warned me twice today  Each time I pray, make love not end  Got no time to wait 
[00:06:30]  Got no time to wait  Cool  That fucking song is badass  God damn, that song makes me want to run on a treadmill  I just want to start punching a heavy bag  And not comparing to the band that was in earlier  But that's just as good as, you know, they should be just as good 
[00:07:00]  It's better  What are you talking about?  Jets, the one song is really good  Are you gonna be my girl?  I love that song  That's a badass song  Those other two songs, like, you know, they're okay  This is not my style  But this fucking song is awesome  How these guys aren't huge is crazy  They're not even signed  That's fucking insane  If anybody out there is a record executive  And you're listening to this  And you don't jump on this shit immediately  You're retarded  You know what it is?  They need somebody else to go  That's good stuff  Yeah, yeah, exactly  They need somebody else to come in a room  Or some other record company to want them 
[00:07:30]  Exactly  That's how it works  That's how it works in Hollywood  That's how it works in any entertainment business  Someone else has to step up and take the chance first  Or someone wants you  It's like a fucking  It's like a relationship  You don't want to fuck her until somebody else is fucking  Or wants to fuck her  Well, they don't want to fuck you until you're fucking somebody else  If you're desperate, nobody wants to fuck you  Yeah  That's why when you're in a bad streak  Yeah  Hey, come on  You wreak a desperate  So, what's going on, ladies?  They just smell you and run away  They can see you holding the hammer behind your back  Exactly  They can smash things in a car with 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, there's nothing worse than desperation  And this guy looks  You know what?  The guy, especially with the glasses to leave  Is so fucking marketable  Just get these guys in here  Let's get them in here  Let's talk to them  Can we get them on that mic?  On Anthony's mic over there?  Sure  It's such a fucking weird business, man  And you know what I'm hoping?  I'm hoping that the internet is going to change all this shit  The internet and all these  The access that people have to music now  And comedy  It's already done with comedy  I mean, look what it did to Dane Cook

[00:10:00]  Like if you're just jamming  Like I don't know  Like comics  Like we were talking about before  It can be on stage  You're just working  Or ad-libbing a crowd  Whatever  You'll come up with bits  Do you come up with stuff on stage  From just jamming with each other?  Absolutely  Like when we first start  New original songs  You know, we'll work them over to a degree  In the rehearsal room  You know, we'll go through them  Then we take them out live  For at least three or four months  Before we'd ever record them  Because that's where they become  What they're gonna become on the record  You get the feel  You get changed little things  You know, it'd be cool  If you take out this bridge part  But this and here  They become what they become  By performing them live

[00:19:30]  Completely  Like okay  Here's a perfect example  Octane  Between Jet and Octane  Jet sells millions  Of fucking CDs  Those guys are huge  And they're really good  I mean that song  Are you gonna be my girl  Is badass  These motherfuckers  Just played that song  That song blew me away  Nobody knows who they are  If they had a contest  With Jet  I mean who would win  How do you do that  It's impossible  A fucking Jet  Is traveling to their next gig  On a limo  These guys gotta rush  To Penn Saints  To get their train  Back to Philly  Yeah  You know what I mean 
[00:20:00]  They had a gig tonight  In New York  And it got cancelled  So they don't have shit  And you definitely  Can't compare comedy  The only way to compare comedy  Is going  Well he's done it for two years  He's done it for fifteen  Right  He's where he should be  At two years  He's where he should be  And even then  It's like  What you like  When people say  What do you think  About this comic  This is what I think  About any comic  If they're not  Stealing material  Either I laugh at them  Or I don't laugh at them  And if I don't laugh at them  It doesn't mean they suck  It just means  It's not my shit 
[00:20:30]  People love country music  I mean there's nothing  For me to say  That country music sucks  Because it doesn't suck  For them  They hear some country music  They fucking love it man  They get excited  They turn that shit up  That's what's good for them  They enjoy it  It's art  That's what they like  You can't judge art  You know  You either like it  Or you don't like it  And plus  Everybody knew  That Retard was going to win  Two weeks into the thing  Yeah  Last comic stand  Yeah  I didn't watch the last one  Yeah he was  But here's the thing too  Whatever  The clubs on the road

[00:23:30]  Whatever  But it  Small tits  I don't know  What the fuck  Whatever she said  They called her a cunt  I know  I didn't call her a cunt  But that doesn't work  Whatever you said  She should have accepted  Yeah it was a joke  The audience was laughing  She got up  She threw a drink  At me  The whole place  Went silent  Right  Oh shit  As they were walking around  I go  Don't think you're not  Paying for that drink  Either bitch  Right  The crowd went  Good night  Thank you  Right  Because you got to end  On a big laugh  With a black audience  What is it about black audiences  That are so fucking hostile 
[00:24:00]  And so  If you kill though  You kill  Yeah  When you kill  They're very vocal  They will fall out of their fucking tables  They'll be slapping their hands on the ground  High five  They run  They jump  But if it goes bad  There's no recovery  There's no recovery  A black audience  They know if you're real  Even if you're white or black  They could fucking  They could feel your  You know what I mean  Are you trying to say they're more animalistic  No no no  No  Not at all  What I'm trying to say  They can have a good time  Because they don't have to get up early for work 
[00:24:30]  So they can stay out  They can have  I was doing a black crowd  At a club in New York  And there was a good set going  And I go  I said  How am I going to sabotage this  And I started trashing Sharkton  In front of a black audience  I don't know why  I just started trashing them  And some big big black lady  I just had to be 500 pounds  Started booing me  The audience  Booing  And I go  Bitch as fat as you are  You should be mooing  Right  And they're crying  I went goodnight thank you 
[00:25:00]  But they are the best audiences  If they like you  Because you can be real with them  Either way  There's no silence  I used to do a lot of black clubs in Boston  Because you know  When I first started out in Boston  I couldn't get any gigs in the city  All my gigs were like in bars  And stuff outside of Boston  Anything that you get paid for  Like in town  Like the main clubs  Like were like  Nick's Comedy Stop  And like the Comedy Connection  I couldn't get any of that  Because I was dirty  You know  So I used to work  All these outside rooms  And I used to work  A couple black clubs 
[00:25:30]  In Medford, Dorchester  And dude  When you killed  You fucking killed  You killed  They would die laughing  It was like  The biggest laughs ever  But when you bomb  Man it was death  They like  I was doing a club  Called Terminal D  It was like the first black club  In New Jersey  I mean it was  And I was hosting a show  And this black comic went on  And he was bombing so bad  They were booing him  Giving him the bell  And everything right  So before he ends his show  He goes  You know what  I worked a white club last night 
[00:26:00]  And they were so much better to me  Than my own people  Fuck you  And he walked off  And I went back on  Because I'm the host  I'm going you know  I'm not going to lie  I was at the white club  And they didn't like him here  There either  Right  And that's the shit  Black people love  They just went nuts  They just went nuts  It's like anything else  You get to feel their vibe  You get used to it  I know a lot of guys  Like Dice has gone up  On Fat Tuesdays  In the comedy store  I started in Black Rooms too  Like a little bit in LA  Because the white rooms  Wouldn't have me  Yeah  Just because  Because you're a Jew 
[00:26:30]  Well I wasn't any good  So the black rooms  Were the first ones  That were like put me on  Like real shows  You know what's good  When you're doing a mixed  That's good  When you're doing  A regular club  And there's a mixed audience  Because if you're doing  Racial edgy stuff  The black people laugh  And then white people  Will go well they're laughing  We can laugh  Yeah it's that moment  Of like the look over  And say okay  They're cool  So I can laugh now  You know  Because if it's all white  They're like oh  You know  I can't you know  Do you think they're  Going to lose their  Fucking job  Or they're just  White guilt  I wonder what the  Kramer thing is going to do  For comedy 
[00:27:00]  I wonder if that's  Going to change shit  It might fuck things up  With Jamie Masada  Saying he's going to ban  That's going to change  And how many times  Do people say nigger  I mean how many  How often does that  Get said on stage  Mooney said he won't  Say it anymore  He's used it easily  Over a million times  Mooney's just getting  A little bit more publicity  He's saying it  I would say it on stage  Oh please homie  Homie please  I'm saying it  I would say it more on stage  If I had windows to roll up  And a car door to lock  Bring one on with you  Bring a window  You know what I'm worried about  Is those two fucking douchebags 
[00:27:30]  That were heckling  Those guys  Bottom line  Everyone who heckles  Is a fucking douchebag  There's no cool  Enlightened  Really nice  Friendly hecklers  Those guys are assholes  Any guy screaming shit out  Those guys are pieces of shit  They're interrupting the show  That said  Those guys are suing  And they're suing the laugh factory  What are they suing for?  They got Gloria Allred  She's a cunt  A cunt  She's the worst  She is  She's just looks  Her publicity  For sure  She won't let them do interviews  Unless she gets an interview too  What if they started a show 
[00:28:00]  And here's the idea for this show  What if they started a show  Called heckled  Just like punked  And they set up hidden cameras  In a comedy club  And they have these two douchebags  And they sit in the audience  And they put little something  In their ear  And they have comics  Feed them lines  And they try to fuck up comics  They get like some road guy  Some road guy  That's got like  You know  One  You know  Live at Gotham credit  Or something like that  And he's  You know  Headlining in Bettendorf, Iowa  On a Thursday  And they just  Fuck this guy's world up  That'd be fun to watch  That'd be fun to watch  That's possible, right?  Could you imagine  If they did you 
[00:28:30]  Imagine if you  Were in the fucking audience  With like a fake mustache  On an outfit  So they couldn't recognize you  And you just  Got to  You got to ruin  It'd be great  I mean, come on  And you guys would know too  Went to not talk back  Like, oh, where are you from?  Silence  Well, I mean  But that would be dependent  On them talking back to you  But just to be able  To yell shit out  I mean, to fuck up  I mean, how many times  Have you seen a bad comic  On stage  You just felt like  I could just ruin this guy  If I wanted to  Oh, yeah  Me and Patrice go back and forth  If he's in the audience  And I'm on stage  We'll start going  Yeah, people do that 
[00:29:00]  At the store all the time  Or me and  Don Barris, you know  Yeah  We'll do that all the time  Brian Holtzman  We'll do that  Heckle Holtzman  You know  Or me and Bonnie  Will do that  You know  We have some room  I said to her the other night  I go  Keep it up  I'm not going to  Clean your back off  She goes  That little bit  Will evaporate  Fucking Brian Holtzman  If you've never seen  You have to see this guy  He's hilarious  I just sit and watch him  In amazement  On how out of his mind  And funny he is  He's fucking crazy 
[00:29:30]  Brian Holtzman  Is a guy who's a regular  At the comedy store  In Los Angeles  Very rarely  Does he go anywhere else  He actually works full time  Used to work for US Air  I don't know if he's still  Working for them  Does he  Who does he work for now  Does he have a full time job  Or do you get fired  Pretty sure he's a meter maid  A meter maid  Whoa  Meanwhile  He's one of the funniest  Comics in LA  He's got a joke on Susan Smith  Remember Susan Smith  That chick  Who drowned her kids  He goes  Ladies and gentlemen  I heard those were bad kids  I heard they sat  Right in front of the TV  They didn't put their 
[00:30:00]  Fucking blocks away  They were always  Spilling their milk  They will not be missed  I heard Stanhope  Stanhope had them open  At the improv forum  Out there  He was out of his element  So he wasn't on his game  He's got to be in a dark  Dark room  The best thing about  The comedy store  Is the spotlight hits you  You don't see shit  In the audience  You don't see anybody's face  You don't see one row back  That's it  And he can just be himself  There and play with the  Microphone  And play with his clothes  And just go off  Into his weird  Little Holzman world  He is fucking funny 
[00:30:30]  Yeah  He's very funny  That's what we were talking  About earlier before  Certain comics  You'll walk in a room  I gotta watch this  Fucking guy  It's you know  Cause you never know  What's gonna come out  He's the saddest one to me  Because that guy  Should be huge  I mean I've known Brian  For eight, nine, ten years now  I mean I've known him  Ever since I was at the comedy store  I mean maybe a year after  I was at the comedy store  He started going there  And he's  He's always been fucking hilarious  He's always people's favorite  Yeah  Comics favorite  Yeah  He's a real comics comic  Yeah cause you don't know  Like if he's gonna  Go over 
[00:31:00]  I've seen him  Rush the crowd  Well he got knocked out  By Martin Lawrence's bodyguard  Yeah  Martin Lawrence's bodyguard  Was in the audience  And Martin Lawrence  Was heckling Brian Holtzman  And Brian Holtzman  Starts screaming  I'm a performer  I'm a performer  You're a performer  You're fucking heckling me  You motherfucker  And he got off stage  And went towards  Martin Lawrence  And Martin Lawrence's bodyguard  Knocked him out  Just stepped up  Blam  Knocked him out  In the face  Show over  Holtzman goes  Heels over shoulders 
[00:31:30]  Falls back into some tables  And that was the end  Of the fucking show  That's so funny  These black  You ever see some black comics  They have an entourage  Of like three bodyguards  Yeah  This and that  Like I know  Seinfeld walks around  By himself  Right  Chris walks around  By himself  Yeah  You know  But then you get these guys  That did two TV shows  Like you said  And all of a sudden  They got you know  Guys with walkie talkies  Well I think they need  If they're going to black clubs  They probably need it man  I mean there's a lot of haters  Out there  Would you like to be 
[00:32:00]  Chris Tucker  Walking into a black club  By yourself  Fuck that  You got a point  Fuck that  You know you're not walking  Into some nice restaurant  By yourself  You know you're walking  Into a club  You know you're going  Into a VIP  I mean you've heard stories  About like P.

[00:35:00]  I'm going though  Cool city man  Yeah I've heard  The downtown  They have a statue  Downtown of Mary Tyler Moore  Right downtown  By the Macy's  What  So late at night  I drove and jerked off  On it cause I always  Wanted to fuck her  Right  And that's the closest  I could get to  Was just jerked off  On the statue  They have a statue  Of Mary Tyler Moore  I have two problems  With that  What's the first one  What's the second one  Fuck the first one  The second one  Is you always had  A thing for Mary Tyler Moore  She was hot  Dude back in the day  When  Dude back in the day  Pre-Lou Grant show  Yeah even when  Yeah when she was 
[00:35:30]  Lori Petty on the  Fucking show  With Dick Van Dyke  Dude she was hot  She was super hot  On Dick Van Dyke  She was gorgeous  Yeah  You guys were idiots  And what's the  We're idiots  You were 12 years old  Whoa whoa whoa  Don't you like  Tank girl you fucking homo  That's different  Because she's hot  Okay  Alright what's the  Second problem  What's the first one  Jerking off on a statue  Yeah what are you gonna do  What's the big  You ever jerk off  On a magazine  Yeah  Same shit  There's not people around  Let's take that guy  In Vegas  Alright  Terrell  In Vegas  Go ahead buddy 
[00:36:00]  Hey what's up  What's up dude  Nothing much  I wanted to ask you  What was going on  Well anyway  How you felt about  The government  Trying to ban  Salvia DeMor  Is it  Are they trying to ban it  I know they're trying to ban it  Here in Vegas  It's all over in the news  Like they're trying to say  It has dangerous properties  And that kids are using it  As a second way  They get high  They're comparing it to marijuana a lot  Yeah  Obviously  They're two completely different substances  Well it's a pretty serious psychedelic  It's kind of weird that it's legal  There was another drug that was legal 
[00:36:30]  That's even more powerful  It's still legal technically  Which is called 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine  5-MeO-DMT  Which you used to be able to get online  And just order it  And it's about a million times more powerful than mushrooms  Which is legal  Which is illegal rather  And this Salvia Divinorum  Is I know they tried a long time ago  Like a couple years ago  To make it illegal  And it didn't get passed  You could still buy it at head shops  And it's kind of crazy  Online stuff  Yeah it's way more powerful than marijuana  Way more powerful than 
[00:37:00]  I mean  It's an out of body experience  When you smoke it  You have these really intense psychedelic experiences  What do you get it from?  What is it?  It's Salvia Divinorum  It's a plant  And you smoke it through a bong  And it's a psychedelic plant  Is it new?  Was that that  It's been around for thousands of years  It was a CSI episode with that shit  When they were doing it out in the desert  Were they?  Yeah  That might have been mescaline  It might have been peo  No no they smoked it  They had to smoke it  Oh okay  Then it might have been Salvia  Yeah it's a  Well you know what man  There's no reason to make any of these things illegal  The problem is  When people find out that that's legal 
[00:37:30]  They go  Well how come that one's legal  And marijuana's not  And then it makes things tricky  So they have to try to make things illegal  So that they don't have to make marijuana legal  They're in a real bad situation  Where you know basically  They're still running around saying  That Santa Claus is real  You know I mean that's what  By making marijuana illegal  They're saying Santa Claus is real  They're saying something ridiculous  But your point about making marijuana illegal  And you had some good points before  When they were in  You know we were talking  But where do you draw the line?  Do you make cocaine illegal?  Do you make heroin illegal? 
[00:38:00]  I think everything should be legal  This is what I think  I think if you're fucking dumb enough to do heroin  You should be able to do heroin  I think I believe in the laws of  I believe in social Darwinism  And I think we should have real education  And people should really know  What's legal and what's not legal  And I think if you're going to have drugs  Like Valium and alcohol  And all these other different prescriptions  That are available  You should also have heroin  You should also have cocaine  And tax them through the fucking roof  Tax them heavily  And use that money for treatment centers 
[00:38:30]  And let people know what's good for you  And what's bad for you  But when you say  If you're dumb enough to get it  Okay there's alcoholics  That are brilliant  Okay  They didn't set out to become alcoholics  They drank alcohol  It was legal  It was social  So you think alcohol should be illegal?  No, no  But I'm saying  I'm saying  You can't say  Only dumb people  If you get addicted  Dumb people  Okay  Well alcoholism is a little bit different  Because I think people  Even heroin  I mean heroin  Apparently  If you smoke heroin once 
[00:39:00]  Or shoot it once  You're probably gone  Right?  Most people  I don't know  It takes a couple times  Well crack and heroin  Crystal meth  All these different things  But we should know that  There should be  The lies that they tell about marijuana  Don't serve them  In the truth that they tell about crystal meth  Or the truth they tell about real problem drugs  And if you think that people should have free reign  To drink alcohol whenever they want  Which I do  If you think people have free reign  To swallow a thousand  If you want to fucking swallow 
[00:39:30]  A thousand sleeping pills and die  You should be able to  I mean you should be able to do  Whatever the fuck you want to do  But we should be honest  About what the effects of these things are  That's what I think  And I think  And if you're going to have a society  Where these drugs like Valium  Or any of these other crazy drugs  Are legal  You should have everything legal  Everything should be legal  You're going to make sure to regulate it  Yeah  I mean we're adults  Who is one grown adult  To tell you what to do  And what not to do  With your life or your body  As long as you're a grown adult  Keep it away from children for sure  And educate everybody  But it's going to affect  It's going to affect people  That don't use it 
[00:40:00]  For a while  It'll affect them  What do you mean  Well first of all  If it's legal  The whole crime aspect is bullshit  Because there will still be crime  Because whether it's legal or not  People still don't have money  When they're addicted  So they're going to still rob and steal  That's a good point  So that whole crime aspect  Do you think more people  Would be addicted if it was legal  Yeah you know why  Because if it's social  If it's okay at a party  To put out a plate of cocaine  A person that's not as educated  At that age  And kids at 15 and 16  Think they're invincible  No matter how educated they are 
[00:40:30]  They still think they're invincible  But they can still get it  There's no shortage of cocaine  And the real problem is  The cocaine they're getting  Is all cut with speed  And all kinds of other shit  At least if cocaine was legal  You'd get cocaine  You'd get real cocaine  Okay but here's the difference with that  You say they could still get it  But the person that doesn't  Isn't sure whether they want to do it  Or this or that  They're not going to go out  And hunt for it  Okay  That person that's not sure  Maybe I should  Maybe I shouldn't  If it's right there  And acceptable  It's easier for them to do  Maybe  Well you know  You counter that with education 
[00:41:00]  I think bottom line is  First thing  All plants should be legal  All of them  Whether it's salvia divinorum  Whether it's marijuana  Even cocaine  If you eat coca leaves  Coca leaves aren't dangerous at all  It's no more dangerous than coffee  The way it's eaten in Peru  The way they chew it  They chew the coca leaves  They actually get vitamins and minerals  From coca leaves  And it's a better buzz than caffeine is  And it's not bad for you  It's a synthetic processed version of cocaine  That's cut with speed  And all that other shit  That's where it becomes dangerous  You know good coke  Everybody says it's cut with speed 
[00:41:30]  It's speed  If you're smoking it or shooting it  The speed is gone  Usually  You cook it out  And you got pure coke  Well you're going hardcore here  Well but that's what it leads to  Which Fox is taking it to another level  You're shooting it  Whoa  Well when you got that needle in your cock  Well I don't know  It's such a debatable thing  And there's no  It's that legalizing or not legalizing  It's almost like arguing about religion or politics  It is in a way  Because people look at it as a religious thing  Like they look at it the same way  They have like rights and wrongs 
[00:42:00]  And what's black and white  But I think for sure  Adults should be able to do  Whatever the fuck they want to do  Who am I to tell you  You can't do heroin  If you want to do heroin  If you know everything about heroin  You know  You're educated  You know what the facts are  And you want to do it  What the fuck do it  I know some casual coke users  You know  There's not that many  But I know a few  That just  They do it once in a while  They're not addicted to it  And it's like  It works for them  Now there's always going to be things  Where it's like  Well some kid's going to get it  You have to weigh the positives and negatives  The amount of crime that's around  Because it's illegal  I think outweighs 
[00:42:30]  The bad stuff that's going to happen  When people have more access to it  It's just education  You need education in the treatment center  But there's no education at 15 or 16  There is none  Because they  Look at how much education  Why don't they have it  They would be forced to  Parents would be forced to educate them  They'd be forced to educate them  No I'm not saying there isn't any  They get it  They just don't listen  Because they don't think anything  How many 15 and 16 year old kids got pregnant  Alright  There's a lot of education  When it comes to sex  Yeah but that's different dude  You got a boner  You're making out  Shit happens 
[00:43:00]  Those kids are being lied to about pot  And they know that's wrong  And they're like  Well what about this coke  You say that's bad too  I don't know  That is a problem  That's a big part of the problem  But when I was a kid man  I learned quick  I had a buddy of mine who was selling  He was selling coke  And him and his girlfriend  Would just do blow all day  He lost like 30 pounds  He looked like a fucking skeleton  He'd hide in his attic all day  Just watch TV and do blow  And I looked at him  And I was like  Fuck cocaine man  That does that  Fuck that  You know people learn  You see people fucking up  And you learn  I mean that's what it's supposed to be  We're supposed to learn  From screw ups in our environment 
[00:43:30]  It's the drug show here  Every time I'm on  It turns into drugs  What else we got man  Do you want more drug guys  Or do you want to try some  Let's try  See if someone's got a different  Who has questions about  Rainbows  How about UFC stuff  Do you want to try that show  I had this discussion  With my students  Yeah put that guy on  The guy had this discussion  With his students  Dave from New York  Go ahead  Hey how you guys doing man  What's up dude  I'm a teacher man  And I've had this discussion  In my class even  With regard to  When you were talking earlier 
[00:44:00]  About outlawing it  And the economic effects of it  You know I believe that  The government can even get rid of  The drug trade here  To a certain degree  Or at least bring a lot of people  To their knees  A lot of the big time kingpins  But that they choose not to  Because of the economic consequences of that  You know and I've had this discussion  In my classroom  With my kids  And it's been a great debate with them  You know  How old are your kids  Well I teach seniors  Okay  Yeah seniors 
[00:44:30]  They can kind of grasp the concepts  You know they're kind of  They kind of already know  That they're getting fucked too  I mean by the time you're 17  You kind of realize  That your parents are just dummies  Who had kids  Is there any really hot seniors  That you know are going  Come on there's got to be  Some fucking hotties  You're going oh Jesus  In two years  You want some coke  After school come back  In two years  I'll show you what you shouldn't do  In two years  When you're out of school  No  Where do you teach  What state  Well I'm in New York right now 
[00:45:00]  But I just came from Florida  So I've been teaching in Florida  Oh Jesus Christ  Florida seniors  Now what are the kids  How do the kids mostly feel  Are kids like  There's a lot of kids  That are saying that drugs are bad  Are other kids saying  That the government's lying  Like what  What do 17 year old kids feel  About this shit  They think that weed  Should be legal  You know  But the one thing  That I've heard too  Through the grapevine  And you know  We all of us know  What's going on  With our students  A lot of girls now  Are sniffing coke  As an appetite suppressant  Really 
[00:45:30]  So you know  Wow  You were talking about  Education before  They know how bad  The drugs are  But they feel  That it's better  To be thin  And attractive  For whatever reason  Yeah we got  That was the thing too  We got a fat friend  Who smoked cigarettes  For that Brian  Brian smoked cigarettes  To stay skinny  Yeah so you gotta  When you're 18 and white  You are invincible  And you're like  Yeah I know  People get addicted  But I won't  I am on top of the world  You're white  You gotta  How do you know  I think that's a big part of it too  How do you know  What it's like to be 18 and black  I have friends that told me 
[00:46:00]  How do you know  What it's like to be 18 and black  Oh what do you mean  I don't  Maybe they're invincible too  Yeah  No  Why did you say 18 and white  No it starts at 9  When they're black  Because cops harass them  And stuff  You never saw boys in the hood  Hello  Here's the thing too  You gotta educate these kids  You know they think cocaine  Is gonna keep the weight off  You gotta tell them  Look if you're gonna be anorexic  You gotta do laxatives  You gotta  You know  You can't  If you're gonna pick a disease  And you wanna have an eating disorder  Do it right  Okay  You're gonna be a cross at it 
[00:46:30]  It's your choice  Thanks a lot dude  Thanks for calling in man  You're welcome  Take somebody else man  Uh right  More drugs  Sure  Anthony from Virginia  Go ahead  Yeah I just wanted to call  And agree with Joe on this man  I mean  The fact is  If you ask any  Anybody  If you know  Hey buddy  You ever tried cocaine  Or you ever do cocaine  And they say  Oh no I don't do that  Nobody says  If you ask them why  They've never done it  They never say  Oh it's because it's illegal  People don't make choices  About drugs based on legal 
[00:47:00]  That's a good point  That's a real good point  Yeah  I've never done coke  Just because it seems so fucking harsh  Yeah  Nobody I've ever asked  I mean I've asked hundreds of people  This question  And the same thing holds true  And Joe  To jump on yourself  A little bit more about this  I mean  If you  If you  Could get some kind of leverage  Around  You know  Trying to get some support  Around the drug thing  All you have to do is say  Look  Let's  Let's legalize everything  And use all the money  That we create  Government wise  To fund education  Yeah but the problem is  The problem is 
[00:47:30]  The money would go to the government  It's just like your taxes  Where the fuck  Does it really go  Yeah  I know  You're always going to have that  How much education is there  For alcohol abuse  Yeah  Like zero  Yeah  All that money that goes to tobacco  How much education is there  To tell kids that tobacco is bad for you  It's like a fucking commercial  Every couple years  You see something  Just say no to smoking  It's still the coolest thing  You can possibly do  Yeah it's  I mean the cigarette numbers  Are really insane  If you think that the government  Is protecting you  Alcohol is an herb  It's a plant  Just like marijuana is  Except it's a plant  That kills  A half a fucking million people 
[00:48:00]  A year in this country alone  Man  I mean that's a crazy number  I've done  Every single drug  Imagine what  Besides maybe like a heroin  Or crack  And I can tell you by far  Alcohol  I've done more stupid stuff  By drinking a couple of beers  Than anything I've ever done  By doing shrooms  Or acid  Or any of the other things  I've tried in my life  Alcohol by far is the worst  Here's what I think  This weekend  If people are getting high  Or drinking  And they come to Governor's  In Levittown  We're on that  It's not going to really bother me  If they come off 
[00:48:30]  What if they're doing coke Rich  If they're doing coke  As long as they buy my DVD  After the show  What if they can't shut the fuck up  What if they're doing coke  And they just  Jawn in the audience  I know  Cigarettes  Cigarettes are the fucking worst  It's the biggest killer  And it makes your pussy stink  So stop it  I quit smoking  Almost six months ago  Girls who smoke cigarettes  They always have like  A weird smell of their pussy  It's always just this weird  Fucking funky disease  Like your body's  Fighting it off  In every cell  And your pussy's not  Spared from that stink 
[00:49:00]  It's everywhere  It's in your yellow fingernails  And your skin's  A weird gray color  And your pussy  Smells like death  Have you ever smoked  Have you ever smoked  I smoked once when I was 15  I tried it  I didn't like it  I quit  I got a joke about  Blowjobs are way more addictive  I go  You have one good blowjob  When you're 15  You're fucked for the rest of your life  Yeah  Blowjobs just haunt you  Like a bad memory  All right  Craig from New Jersey  He's got a question for Joe  Go ahead buddy  What's going on  Yo first off  I'm pretty stoked 
[00:49:30]  That Opie gave you the reins  Joe  Thanks man  You hate Opie  Yo so what's up  With these lollipops  Like are they worth it  Where do you get them  Well I get them in California  In California  They have these  Medical marijuana dispensaries  They call them  Wellness centers  It's hilarious  You walk  You walk into  A fucking store  I mean it's basically a store  You show them your prescription  And you buy weed  You know  And the place that I go to  You buy it with a fucking credit card  I pay for it with American Express  Buy just bags of weed  I buy pot soda 
[00:50:00]  Pot lollipops  Yeah but you gotta have the  You gotta have a prescription  But how do you get the prescription  You go to the doctor  The doctor says what's wrong  You say I get headaches  When do you get headaches  Whenever I think about the fact  That pot's illegal  Bang  You got a prescription  Really  Yeah it's that fucking easy  They're trying to give away prescriptions  My doctor's hilarious  He's this cool old black dude  He was a  He was a fucking  He was an emergency room surgeon  For 25 years  So he just saw fucking gunshot wounds  Yeah  And people getting run over by cars  And shit  And now he just dispenses weed  And when you walk into his office 
[00:50:30]  The first thing he says  You look sick  You look sick my man  You need some medicine  You need some healing  How about you my friend  You look sick too  Sit down  I'm gonna be right with you  And he just like  Looks at you  Man  Isn't weed a wonderful thing  Isn't it wonderful  I'm like dude  It's the best man  Wouldn't it be a better world  If everybody smoked weed  It would be a better world  And he's just writing my prescription  While he's saying that  He really thinks  It's not harmful at all  And it's like  Why shouldn't people have it  If it'll help them out  You know all it is  It makes people nicer 
[00:51:00]  It makes people more relaxed  And all the prejudice  That we have on it  Is all based on propaganda  Yeah there's some fucking  Dumb stoners out there  And the good thing about California  But there's some dumb  Everything out there  There's all kinds of dumb people  And if you get a fucking  Retard high  They're still gonna be retarded  What's up dude  How long do you think  Before Jersey's like California  I don't know man  People gotta fight for it  You know the thing about California  Is it's the most progressive state  In the country  So people have been fighting for it  For a long time  And in 1996  Is when they passed  Proposition 215  And made it legal 
[00:51:30]  So they gotta fight for it  There's 11 states right now  That have medical marijuana  And it's growing  But you know what man  It's not an easy battle  Because it's a battle of education  People even in California  There's a city near my house  In Agora  Where they don't want it  So they booted it out  And they passed a law  You can't have a medical marijuana  Dispensary in Agora  You know it's real weird  Because it's state legal  But it's not federally legal  So if anybody  Like people complain  Then the federal government  The DEA can come down on them  It's all fucked up man 
[00:52:00]  When you say about  Marijuana  I don't know  Whatever in jail  Now these aren't just marijuana  That's been busted  Like an ounce or less  No a lot of it's dealers  But I mean people  Get busted  In certain states  You get busted with a joint  You go to fucking jail  You go to jail  For like six months  In certain states  No  Yes man  There's some zero tolerance  Certain places  It's way harsher  Than other places  Yeah  There's a lot of states  That are living in the fucking 30s  They don't know what's going on  Think about this too  In terms of when it's going to be  In New Jersey  Like legal  Or you know 
[00:52:30]  California was the first one  To outlaw smoking inside  Yeah  And then how long  Did that take for New York  To catch on  A few years  But it's more controversial  Than that  Because of children  You know  Here's the bottom line man  There's a big chunk  Of this country  That's living in the fucking  Dark ages  And if you don't think  That's true  Take a drive  Get in your car  In New Jersey  And drive across the country  And stop every two hours  And look around  You'll be fucking shocked  Oh shit  You can find it  Go to Newark  In parts of Jersey  You can find it  But most of the country  Is a red state 
[00:53:00]  And the reason why  They're red states  Isn't because  They're educated  Because they've thought this out  They're a red state  Because those people  Are saying the right shit  For them  Family  God  This  That  And they're simple  Minded people  Who want  Everything in a little  Simple minded box  And they hear drugs  And they just go  Oh bad  Yeah  Bad drugs  Is gonna fucking  Ruin this country  And that's all they hear  And that's all they think  It's gonna take a long time  The internet is helping it  The internet  And education  And you know  And more people standing up  And telling the truth about it 
[00:53:30]  That's why Jews got such a bad rap  In the Midwest  Now South  Because all the propaganda  Yeah  When the farms were being foreclosed  Back in the 80s  When you know  They were just  The government was  Farm aid times  Yeah  Was closing farms  Because they were  You know  The head of  Supremist organizations  And stuff  To recruit people  The Jews  The Jew bankers  Are closing your farms  And Jews didn't even run the banks  Jews never  You know  Chase Manhattan  Jews  These weren't Jew-run banks  But these people  Didn't have any knowledge  And they needed somebody 
[00:54:00]  You need an enemy  And it can't be yourself  It's gonna be  Well you always gotta  Point your finger  It's too hard  To look deep into things  So the first thing they hear  Is the thing that's gonna stick  For most people  The first thing they hear  Is the thing they're gonna remember  You know  It's real hard  To look in  And do a Google search  And start reading articles  On the internet  And pick up a book  And find out the history of it  Yeah  People don't do that  They hear one thing  Jew banker  Those motherfuckers  And it's great to have an excuse too  That's why I always got laid  I always  The first thing I said to your girl  Is I'll never hurt you  And you know  That sticks 
[00:54:30]  The first thing  I'll always be there for you  What do you gotta do  All right  Let's get a girl in here  Wendy from Maryland  Go ahead  Hi  What's up Wendy  Hi Joe  I just wanted to let you know  First of all  I love you  Oh thank you  I love you too  I love watching you on UFC  I love it  But I have a question  First of all  I think you should run for president  I love your views  Why do you want me to get shot  No  You would have definitely got shot  I would be president  For about 13 minutes 
[00:55:00]  Unless you had a Jew vice president  You'll never get shot  They've got that whole president thing  Wrapped up  There's no presidents anymore  The last time we had a president  He took a slow ride  In a convertible through Dallas  Yeah  There's no presidents now  There's spokesmen for giant corporations  That's all it is  True  I mean I think  I think we need a big meteor  To clean everything up  My other question is  You have those suckers  Are they chronic candy suckers?  No  No  No  Chronic candy  It just tastes like pot 
[00:55:30]  This is made with pot  Okay  Because that's what I was going to say  I had those chronic candy ones  And they suck  I did not like them at all  No those are disgusting  Joe gave me my first pot  Pop  Whatever it's called  And I called him El Diablo  For the next month  Because  It seemed fine  It was like  I'm just looking  Nothing's happening  You're like easy  And I was like  Whatever  Fuck you  Easy  I don't feel anything  And then I just started seeing  My god and my devil  Fighting out for control of my soul  People always want to claim  Machismo when it comes to pot  Like dude I'm fine 
[00:56:00]  Like I told you  I fucked Charlie Murphy up dude  I fucked that guy up  He wouldn't get high before  He went on stage for the rest of the tour  But also it tastes like butterscotch  Yeah  That's never bad for you  Butterscotch  You've had those sodas too right  I give you a pot soda  That was a good fucking  All body buzz  It was really good  Tastes like crap though  I got some stuff that'll rock you dude  I got some little Listerine  Strips those little things you put on your tongue  Really?  Yeah  Like little breast strips  They're little strips  You put it in your tongue  And all of a sudden you're on fucking Pluto  It's called blotter acid  No it's called pot  It's called pot Listerine strips 
[00:56:30]  Where do you live in Maryland?  Cumberland  It's a small hick town  Yeah  Do they have any  Is there a lot of pot there and stuff?  Yeah  That's all there is to do here  The problem is you never know what you're getting  You know that's the thing about the medical marijuana thing in California  Is you know exactly what you're getting  You know what strain it is  You know like where it's coming from  You know the percentage of THC  You know  It's like they've got it down to a science in California  Cops don't really care too  They don't give a fuck  How bad is it in New York?  I don't think they care  No  I hosted the High Times Music Awards here 
[00:57:00]  We did it at BB King's  And there was fucking weed passed around left and right here  Really?  And cops are outside  I don't know how they did it  I don't know who they greased up  Or what  But the thing about California is  It's so overwhelming  In San Francisco  There's twice as many medical marijuana dispensaries  As there are Burger Kings  There's 40  There's 20  McDonald's rather  20 McDonald's  40 medical marijuana dispensaries  Really?  Yeah  They're not stopping  They're not stopping  They won't stop  You know  Alright thanks Wendy  Thank you 
[00:57:30]  Is anybody for the  Making drugs illegal?  Do you have any callers that way?  Oh yeah you'll get called  Not on this show  No  Not yet  Fucking open Anthony dude  What are you kidding me?  You're the other side  Half these people haven't left their basement  What are you kidding me?  They want to make treadmills illegal  If you're going to make drugs illegal  You've got to make the dangerous ones illegal first  And no one's doing that  Alcohol and tobacco  Those are number one and number two  Those are the fucking scary ones man  Those are the ones that are killing people  There's too much money behind that  You're not going to 
[00:58:00]  You guys want to take a quick break  And there's a bunch of UFC questions  You want to break and then go to those  Are those for boss?  I don't need a break  You need a break  Do you guys have to take a break?  No  Then let's just keep going  Alright cool  Yeah  Alright switching gears  Let's go to Sean in New Orleans  Sean go ahead man  Hey Joe  What's up dude?  A couple UFCs ago  They had a dude with a caved in chest  Oh yeah that's Trey Tellingman  And you didn't say anything  I was like dude  You're a comedian  Oh no I've talked about it before  He's fought a bunch of times in the UFC 
[00:58:30]  He's a real good fighter  He actually got in a car accident  When he was a baby  And uh  Yeah  And he got really fucked up  And you know  One of his pectoral muscles is missing  And his chest is caved in  He has no pectoral muscle?  Yeah  Yeah  He can kill people?  It's real weird  Yeah oh yeah  He'll fuck you up  Does he just not punch on that side?  No he punches both hands  He's a professional boxer  So where does his power play from?  The punching is not actually from your chest  Your chest is really to push things away from you  Punching is really from your back and your shoulders  Okay  That's the real muscles  Just how does he get 
[00:59:00]  Like if you look at like Roy Jones Jr  He's a real good puncher  He never had a big chest  He doesn't have big triceps  It's all shoulders and biceps  You know  If people get on top of him  Can he not throw them off?  He can throw them off  I mean he can bench press  He's just you know  On that side  He's using more of his shoulder  And you know  Other muscles and triceps  When you watch like the ultimate fighting  Like if you watch a karate tournament  There's like so much more kicking  And the kicking looks more deadly  You know what I mean?  In ultimate fighting  The kicking isn't as deadly 
[00:59:30]  Is it as the  You know  Sure it is  Guys get knocked out  Let me tell you something  You get hit in the head  It's a little more difficult to land a kick  Because it's a little slower  And you know  It's a little more obvious  You see it coming  You use your whole body when you do it  But if a guy lands a fucking kick to your head  Dude you're going to sleep  You know  A lot of guys can take a good punch  There's very few guys  That can take a kick to the head  Well a side kick  Or like that  You're talking you know  A roundhouse to the head  You're talking right?  Any kind of kick to the head man  Most of the kicks that land to the head  That's a fish that elbow to the head 
[01:00:00]  The knee to the head  Yeah  Flying knee  Yeah  Most of the kicks that land  I mean if you land a foot  And the guy's like moving away  You can get away with it  But if you get caught in the head  With a fucking shin  Like you get shinned to the head  Dude that's like getting hit in the head  With a baseball bat  I mean the only thing that saves guys  Is that the guy's kicking you  He's really tired  You know  And he's exhausted  And he's not getting full energy into it  Or you know  You're moving away from the blow  But it's way more powerful  To kick somebody  Just think about  Physically  Yeah it's four times as strong  Yeah  Yeah the legs  And you're using your whole torso 
[01:00:30]  And so  But it's just that  When I used  I mean years ago  When I used to watch karate tournaments  Or you would see like  You know a taekwondo tournament  Whether it's pussy or this or that  And you'd see like a reverse roundhouse  And it was just so  You know clean like that  You know what I mean  Just  You know  And the guys are sparring  And you see  Just back and forth  And it almost looks like  Like it's orchestrated  You know what I mean  And then with ultimate fight  You'll never see like a reverse roundhouse  Yeah you do  You do  Oh you do  Like a wheel kick or something  You do  But the guys have to be really good at it  See the thing about mixed martial arts 
[01:01:00]  Is everybody's coming from a different discipline  A lot of guys are coming from wrestling  A lot of guys are coming from kickboxing  And there's very few guys  That are coming from taekwondo  But the guys who are coming from taekwondo  If they know how to use that shit  There's a few kicks  My background originally was in taekwondo  Most of taekwondo is useless  But there's a few kicks that work  Like David Loazzo's got a nasty spinning back kick  And he stopped Charles McCarthy with it in the UFC  And it's a fucking badass move  And very few guys throw it  But if a guy's good at it  And he throws it  And it lands  It'll fucking cripple you man 
[01:01:30]  It's like getting hit with a  Like a telephone pole  In the middle of your chest  And then there's wheel kicks  Or a spinning heel kick  Nobody's doing those yet  But those will knock you the fuck out man  If someone's good at it  And they figure out how to do it  It's going to enter into the UFC  It's just going to take some time  The sport is evolving right now  And right now what we're seeing is  You know  Step three or four  In a multi-step process  Of this sport becoming  You know like  It's really  It's the sport of fighting  You know 
[01:02:00]  And fighting  There's a whole bunch of different ways to fight  And initially they thought  When the UFC was first around  Well it's only about grappling man  If Hoist Gracie gets a hold of you  He takes you to the ground  Well guys figured out  How to not get taken down to the ground  They figured out how to keep away  And knock you the fuck out standing  Like a guy like Chuck Liddell  So all of a sudden  That became the way to fight  But there's going to be people  That figure that style out too  There's going to be better kickboxers  There's going to be guys  Who figure out how to pull guard  There's going to  It's a constant evolution  You know  And it's a young sport  I mean it's only been around  In this country  Really as ultimate fighting 
[01:02:30]  Since 1993  I was  I don't know if I was  What I was watching  But don't  Isn't there guys that just come in  That don't have a martial art background  That are just  Ballroom brawlers  No those guys are fucked  That was in the old days  What was that  That's it  I mean Tank Abbott  I mean everybody calls about Tank Abbott  A ballroom brawler  Tank Abbott's a serious wrestler  He knows how to wrestle  You know  He's an athlete  He knows how to box  I mean he's not an untrained fighter  Yeah  He puts on this thing  Like he fights in bars  And he will fight in bars  And he does like getting drunk  And he does like doing that  But the bottom line is  That guy knows how to fight 
[01:03:00]  The reason why he fought  In all those UFC's  And did so well  Is because he knows how to fight  You can't just take a guy  With no training  Who thinks he's a badass  And fight  Because it's like saying  You don't know how to speak a language  And someone teaches you a few words  And you go run  And try to have a conversation with someone  Not even have a conversation  But have an argument with someone  I mean that's what it's like  These guys are so fucking good now  There's so many guys  That are so good in so many areas  In so many  In wrestling  And boxing  And kickboxing  They'll just fuck you up  You got no chance 
[01:03:30]  That's like when Tyson went to prison  You know there was someone  That wanted to test him  Because he might have been  The tough prison guy  But Tyson was a fucking fighter  Yeah  And just probably knocked  Every fucker that came out  Well I bet they just  Left him the fuck alone man  I mean who wants to get  Punk'd by Tyson  Yeah  You know fuck that man  Alright Tim from Florida  Go ahead  Hey Joe  Quick question for you man  I'm looking to get into it  And with all the studios  That are popping up here  And there  Especially in Florida  Is there a website  That you can help out  A guy starting out  Yes  The best website 
[01:04:00]  You can go to  The best website  You can go to  For mixed martial arts  Is MMA.tv  It's a  There's a forum  Called the underground  The underground forum  It's the best mixed martial arts  Website in the world  Bar none  Without a doubt  Any questions you have  About legitimate gyms  Or trainers  Or anything  Pro fighters  Post on that  I post on that thing  Every day  I check it every day  Everyone that I know  That's involved in the UFC  Dana White  Anyone that I know  That's involved in  Any of  Any of the different 
[01:04:30]  Organizations  Whether it's the  IFL  Or Pride  They all check the underground  The underground is the shit  If you got any questions  Go there  What part of Florida  Are you at?  What part of Florida?  Where am I in Florida?  I'm in Port St. Lucie  What's that near?  Is that near Miami?  West Palm Beach  Sebastian  How far is West Palm  West Palm Beach  Is not that far from Miami  Right?  No  No  You got to go  An hour  American top team  If you want to get involved 
[01:05:00]  In the UFC  American top team  Is in Florida  And it's literally  One of the best gyms  In the country  There's maybe  You know  Three or four  Of the best gyms  In the country  American top team  Is one of them  And it's run by  This guy named  Dan Lambert  Who's this rich character  Who loves fighting  Put it together  And it's down there  I think they're in Miami  But I think you can go to  Just do a Google search on it  And find them  But American top team  Is you couldn't get  A better place to train  Some of the best trainers  In the world there  What do you think?  Thanks man  Real quick  Liddell Ortiz 
[01:05:30]  Who's better?  Liddell  He beat him before  And you know  Tito Ortiz is a good fighter  But if you look at their skill set  I mean look  Anything can happen  Tito might win the fight  I mean you can never  You can never guess  I mean fights are crazy  That's why they fight  In the first place  But if you look at  Their two skill sets  Liddell's a better wrestler  His takedown defense is insane  And he's got sick  Knockout power  And he put Tito to sleep already  So he's confident  The only thing that's  Going to fuck him up  Is if he goes into this fight  And he doesn't train hard  And believe me  The last person he wants  To lose to is Tito  So he's going to train hard 
[01:06:00]  But who knows man  Anything can happen  And plus  Tito Ortiz  Has got Jenna Jameson power  For like the average person  That's not going to  That's real  For the guy that's not  Going to compete  What's the best thing  For him  If you're not going to  Compete  It depends on what  You're doing it for  If you're doing it for  Exercise  Some people like  Some people like  Jiu Jitsu  Some people like  Striking  They like boxing  Or Muay Thai  It's all in  What you enjoy  I like the Jiu Jitsu  Because there's no  Real injuries  Well you get it  I've had two  Major knee surgeries 
[01:06:30]  I've had two  Reconstructed ACLs  One of them  Is from Taekwondo  But two of them  I've had three  Knee surgeries  Two of them  From Jiu Jitsu  A meniscus tear  And an ACL tear  I mean you can get hurt  I'm sure  I've known a lot of guys  I've known guys  Break their arm  Break their leg  Break their ribs  Shit happens  But you don't get  Head injuries  Like you do  Sparring  When I used to kickbox  Man I'd go home  And I'd have fucking  Headaches  You'd lie in bed  And it sucks man  You know  Just sparring  Just sparring  You take shots  And it's not even  Your sparring partner's  Fault sometimes  You walk into something 
[01:07:00]  You know he's trying  To pull a punch  But you walk into a knee  Or something man  And then your fucking  Head hurts  And the reason why  Your head hurts  Is because you got  Brain damage bitch  And that shit's real  You know  And I prefer not  To get brain damage  So I try to limit  My striking  And I just do  A lot of Jiu Jitsu  How about Krav Maga  That's for fags  Thank you  Alright  Found somebody  With a dissenting  Opinion on the  Drug issue  Josh from Oregon  Go ahead man  What's up Joe  Good to hear  What's up Josh  Hey  I have just a little 
[01:07:30]  Different take  On the drug situation  Don't get me wrong  I love drugs  Fucking awesome  And from everything  Except you know  The heroin  And the meth  All that shit  Fuck that  But  If we open it up  To everything  The stipulation  Is just  Drugs are kind of legal  Or they're all illegal  It's completely fucked up  Because the whole  Massive of the whole  Will just  Take themselves  Under  You know  Just take themselves down  And  That's the only problem  With opening them up  To be legal  Is that everybody  Would just 
[01:08:00]  Not have that  That stipulation  Like oh I don't  Want to get caught  So we'll do it safely  Well I think  You're a great example  How education's important  In this country  Well he's your drug user  That's your lobby  Right there  You know what I think man  I think I don't want  A fucking daddy  I'm a grown man  I'm a grown man  And I don't want  The government  To be my fucking daddy  I think the government  Should be really  Really  Really  Really  Really  Really  Small  Hold on  Hold on a second  First of all  No one under 25  Should have a conversation 
[01:08:30]  Because they're not smart  Maybe legal  At a certain age  Maybe legal  At 28  There we go  Not 21  Maybe like  You know  When you're  28 and above  21  26  As soon as you're legal  As soon as it's  It's okay for you to fight  If you can go to war  And fight for your country  You should be able to get high  And think about  Why you're going to war  To fight somebody  You never fucking met  You know  I mean  You want to do some mushrooms  And think about the fact  That we're fighting  We're having tribal war  And our tribe  Is sending us  To another part of the world  I mean  That's a real problem 
[01:09:00]  With drugs  Is that drugs  Would change all that shit  And that's what happened  In the 60s  One of the reasons  Why drugs  Why they're so hard on drugs  Is because  The culture of this  Entire country  Changed in the 60s  And it changed largely  Because of  The consumption of psychedelics  Because of drugs  Because of acid  Because of LSD  And because of marijuana  I mean  That's what changed everything  And I think  That's the reason why  What was that guy's point  The dissenting opinions  They're retards  That guy was building  Something in the background  Yeah but you're just saying  Wait wait  But you just said 
[01:09:30]  Their opinions are retards  But he's high  He's a user  So what side is  Is he a retard  On the against side  Or is he a retard  Because he's a user  He was a retard  Well he wasn't a retard  This is what he was  He was mentally retarded  As you say  Technically  This is what I say  I think he's probably  A little buzzed  When he called us  And he's probably not used  To talking on the radio  And didn't come off  As smooth as he wanted to  But the bottom line is  He's wanting to be protected  You know  That's what the guy's saying  You open up the door 
[01:10:00]  And then everybody's  Going to do it  I don't want a daddy man  Okay  And there's going to be  Dummies out there  And there's going to be  People doing stupid shit  But you know what  You can't protect people  From themselves  And I'm  Look I'm a liberal  In some areas  But I'm a social Darwinist  Man  And I think that  You know  The only way evolution  Is ever going to really play out  Is if the weak  Fucking die off  And that's reality  This is the thing  With any laws too  They raise the speed limit  From 60 to 65  And they say  Well this will increase  Deaths by this much percentage  Right  They say you know what  It's worth it  Well you know what dude  They used to say that  About women voting 
[01:10:30]  You know  Before they made  I mean women have only  Been voting for less than  100 fucking years  And what they were saying  Before they allowed  Women to vote was  They used to say  It would kill society  It would destroy society  You cannot let women vote  And when women  Started voting  What the fuck changed  Nothing changed  Nothing  Yeah go to a network meeting  No  That's not  Women voting  It just leads from  One thing to another  It does  You know Comedy Central  Won't let you use the word  Bitch  Huh  You can say bitch 
[01:11:00]  You can say fucking shit  And they'll beep it  Bitch you can't even use  First of all  I have a  Whoa  Really  Yeah  They said no gay bashing  No use the word bitch  And no rape or AIDS  Dude when we did  The man show  And by the way  I know the man show sucked  And it was only  Partially our fault  Part of it was my fault  Because I was trying to do  Two shows at the same time  Fear Factor and the man show  At the same time  And that was  It was impossible  And there was way too many  Battles to fight over there  But part of it  It was the fucking  Restrictions they put on us  Were ridiculous  It made no sense  And it was in the  Janet Jackson nipple era  Where everybody was going crazy 
[01:11:30]  But we had a game show  That Doug and I tried to do  Called Make Me Hard  Where we did stuff  And the guy would have  A box on his dick  And a light would go off  When he got a hard on  We couldn't call it  Make Me Hard  But we could call it  Make Me Stiff  That was like a serious  Argument that we had  Where they sit down  And we think hard  Is too much  It's too much  We want to make stiff  We can say stiff  What the fuck  Are you talking about  You're exchanging one word  With another word  That means exactly  The same thing  With no confusion whatsoever  It makes no sense  But they're all  Just trying to protect  Their job 
[01:12:00]  They're all retarded  Well I have a pilot  With them now  So I don't think  Anything they do  Is wrong  What's your pilot Rich  It's called  The Best Man  It's fucking hilarious  What's it about  Wedding  Like we'll go up  I'll be the host  And this new co-host  Every week  Yeah  And the couples get married  And we go interview  And hang out with the family  He'll be with the wives  With the ladies  And I'll be with them  Bachelorette parties  Softball  Whatever  And we're just spending time  With them the whole  And then during the wedding  We go up and roast the couple  Really  We just go up  And find out a lot about them 
[01:12:30]  And then  Yeah we find out  Regular people can't take that  Most people can't take that  Well then they don't sign on  It was  The pilot was so much  I did it with Patrice  Is that the one  Is that the one I heard about  Where the  Executive wanted to come down  And watch  Patrice lit into them  How does everybody hear about  Everything in this fucking business  Florentine  Oh  Florentine  Can anything  It was so funny  And it just  You know  It's so uncomfortable 
[01:13:00]  That you know  You're going to  And if it  You know  That sounds like a good show  Yeah that could be really fun  Is it  Has it been picked up  Or  We're not finished  I gotta go do  Finish it up  Do some voiceovers  And stuff  Sweet  So it's going to be called  The Best Man  Yeah  Look for it  Fuckers  What else we got  Alright  Bo  Bo in Tennessee  Go ahead man  Hey what's up Joe  What's up dude  Hey missed you on the last  Couple UFC's man  It just doesn't flow  As well without you  But  My question is  You know  UFC is  Is just dominating 
[01:13:30]  As far as  Where boxing used to be  As far as  Popularity in a sport  Do you see like  Another brand  Coming up  To compete with  UFC  Because you look at  Like De La Hoya's  Fight coming up  He's getting paid  Like 40 million dollars  For this thing  And the UFC guys  I mean  Some of them  Even have to work  Other jobs  And can't train  All the time  Do you see another  Brand coming up  To compete with them  Well there's a  First of all  Most boxers  Work other jobs  I mean  De La Hoya  Is not most boxers  Tito Ortiz  And Chuck Liddell  Those guys 
[01:14:00]  Don't work other jobs  And they make millions  But is someone  Going to come up  To compete with the UFC  For sure  I mean  There's a bunch  Of different organizations  Right now  That are coming up  Pride  Is starting to make  Their way  Into the United States  They're huge  In Japan  At one point in time  They used to sell  90,000 seat theaters  Out  Or arenas out  I mean  They're monstrous  In Japan  They've kind of  Dropped off a little bit  Because they have  Involvement with some  Organized crime  Stuff in Japan  It's a little funky  Over there  But there's also  The IFL  Which is another  Big organization  That's coming up  And they have 
[01:14:30]  Some fight shows  On Fox Sports Net  And they have  A whole team concept  They have like  You know  Like the California  Anacondas  And all these  Different teams  And like five man teams  And they fight  Against each other  And shit  And there's a  Bunch of other ones  There's WFA  And it's growing  All across the country  It's growing  And there's all sorts  Of new organizations  That are constantly  Coming up  But the UFC  Has a giant jump  On them  The UFC  They do it the best  They have the most  Money to throw at them  The guys who own  The UFC  Are super rich dudes  Who spent an 
[01:15:00]  Incredible amount  Of money  What most people  Don't realize  About the UFC  Before the UFC  Became popular  Those dudes  Were 44 million  Dollars in the hole  They were  They had spent  44 million dollars  With no return  So they were  Constantly losing money  Before it actually  Caught on with the  TV show  The Ultimate Fighter  And then eventually  The pay per view  Numbers went through  The fucking roof  And now it's huge  But they were  Deep deep deep  In the hole  And 44 million dollars  Means you have to  Make 88 million dollars  You have to  Because you're  I mean that kind of money 
[01:15:30]  You're in a 48% tax bracket  So you have to make  Twice that  To make  You know  To have that for profit  So these guys were  Deep in the fucking hole  And most people  Can't afford to get  That deep in  So they bail out  Like there's a company  Called the WFA  They're a huge organization  They had all these  Big money guys  Behind them  Big plans  They put on one show  In LA  It tanked  They lost a shitload  Of money  And everybody  Backed the fuck out  And they were  Supposed to have  A show next weekend  In Vegas  And the show's  Canceled  And now they've  Moved it to  Sometime in January  I root for all of them  Dude  I hope they all 
[01:16:00]  Make it  I want these fighters  To be making  Shitloads of money  It's a fucking  Tough way to  Make a living  And that's all  I'm concerned with  I want to make sure  These guys can  Retire comfortably  And they don't have  To fight  Like way past  The time that they  Want to  Because they need  The money  Yeah I got  One more question  Do you see  Another weight class  Coming in between  The 155 and 170  Yes  You know what  I'm doing a new show  It actually starts  It airs tonight  I think  Is today Thursday  Yeah  It airs tonight  At midnight  On Spike  It's called  Inside the UFC  And I'm hosting it  And we sit down 
[01:16:30]  With Dana White  And it's one of the  Things we talk about  Is weight classes  There's going to be  A 145 pound  Weight class eventually  And they're going to  Make the weight classes  Smaller  Instead of a big jump  Between like 170  And 185  They're going to  Figure out what to do  And they're weighing it out  But the real thing is  It has to go past  The Nevada State  Athletic Commission  And all the other  State Athletic Commissions  As well  It's not as simple as  Let's just decide  To make guys who weigh  One 10 fight  I mean you have to get  That weight class  Approved by the  Athletic Commissions  So it's kind of tricky 
[01:17:00]  Jariah Faber's coming  Over there right  What's that?  Jariah Faber?  Yeah Jariah Faber  Yeah he was  He was hanging out  At the last UFC  And hopefully he'll be  Fighting over there  Yeah there's a perfect  Example of a guy  Who's a great fighter  But he's not quite  Big enough to fight  155  But he's fucking  Awesome at 145  And you know  There's a bunch of guys  Jeff Curran  Ivan Menjivar  There's a bunch of  Great guys who fight  At 145  And I would like to  See that weight class  Open up  I'm good friends  With Rich Clemente  And it just  You know  155 didn't suit him  And 170  Is kind of too big 
[01:17:30]  For him  So it's  It's an in-between  For him  So  Yeah that's  That's another  Good example  That guy should be  Fighting at like  160 something  You know  Yeah exactly  I appreciate it Joe  Thanks a lot  Alright dude  Take it easy man  I met these guys  That I  I wonder if they do  This around the country  I guess they do  They were called  The Fight Club  And they get together  Every like Saturday  Or Sunday  And beat the fuck  Out of each other  Yeah  I mean  But they're really  I mean they're doing  They're doing everything  They got weapons  They're doing  What  Weapons  They're teaching  They're teaching  And fighting  Teaching each other  And fighting 
[01:18:00]  You know  There's one  Do they fight  With the weapons  I didn't see that part  But they were there  The weapons were there  You know  The sticks  And whatever  Whatever  But these dudes  Were killers  I'm telling you  They were  You know  There was one  He was so big  And I  He showed me  You know  I go just show me  He took like that  I mean I'm small anyhow  But  They just practiced  And this was  Some of them were just so  The average looking guy  Maybe one was a little overweight  They're the kind of guy that  If they cut in front of you in line 
[01:18:30]  You'd say something to them  And it could kill you  In the blink of an eye  Or if they cut you off in the car  You know  You give them  You know  You don't even know  Right  What half of these killers look like  And these guys were killers  Well there's a lot of guys  That fight in the UFC  That don't look that scary  You know  And they're  I mean you look at them  They look like average sized guys  Boss  Doesn't look  Boss  Did you say boss  Yeah  Boss Rootin  Yeah  Boss Rootin looks like a fucking killer  Are you crazy  Really  Inclosed  When you saw Boss Rootin  You talk shit to him  The guy's a fucking animal 
[01:19:00]  I don't talk shit to anybody  But inclosed  His neck is as big as your fucking waist  He's got a shaved head  He's covered with tattoos  Tattoos on the palms of his fucking hands  And you look in his eyes  You see straight psycho  Boss Rootin  Is that a better example  He's talking about  He's talking about  Former UFC heavyweight champion  This guy Boss Rootin  Former king of Pancrase  Probably one of the most brutal strikers  Ever to fight in MMA  Just shut the fuck up  If you have a tattoo  He doesn't think he'd look that big  If you have a tattoo above your neck  Don't fuck with that guy  Anybody can get a tattoo above your neck 
[01:19:30]  Yeah but you see  They don't care  They have nothing to lose  Well when you get choked out  And you have a tattoo above your neck  You look even stupider  That's fine  You get tattoos on your face  Like the game  When you like to choke out the game  I like to get that dude's back  You little LA on your face  You little fucker  Go to sleep  Look all you have to do  To get a tattoo on your face  Just go to a tattoo artist  And be dumb enough  To get a tattoo on your face  Those are people  That don't think about the future  Yeah that's the problem  Those guys aren't accountants  Were you there 
[01:20:00]  When we ran into those fucking guys  In San Diego with Bobby Lee  You weren't there  It was me and Jimmy Schubert  And Bobby Lee  This fucking guy  Had these tattooed tears in his face  And Jimmy Schubert  Was trying to pick up his girl  And we almost got killed  Pick up his girl?  Yeah  We almost got killed  And I'm like  The guys got tattoos  On his fucking face  Teardrops  Yeah what more does he have to lose?  He's not a clown  Either that guy's a killer  Or he's really sad  Either way  Leave his girlfriend alone  He's not a clown  He looked like a fucking straight killer  He looked like he just got out 
[01:20:30]  20 minutes ago  Most tattooed guys  When they have him on their face  They are pretty tough  Or at least reckless  Yeah  At least reckless  So that whole thing  You know  Unless they have like  Lips  Like they tattooed a kiss  Well if you see a guy  With a tattoo of the  Leprechaun  The fighting Notre Dame  You don't worry about him  Yeah  All right  Or the Tasmanian devil  All right  Hack  That's a hack tattoo  But when you see a guy  With spider webs on his elbow  Okay 
[01:21:00]  Or a tear  Yeah that's why it doesn't look cool  Or the SS signal  The SS on his hand  Maybe you should back off  Have you ever watched felony fights?  You ever watched some of that shit  On the internet?  In jail?  No no  They take these guys  Who just got out of jail  And they have them fight  And there's fucking no rules  They fight in like a fucking orchard  Like in  Really?  Yeah it was ridiculous  They fought in like some dirt  Dirt field  And this one guy  No rules  Got out of jail  Covered in tattoos  And this fucking Mexican guy  Beat the fuck out of him  Really?  One guy didn't know how to fight  And one guy did  And there's no rules  They don't stop the fight  So the guy was out cold 
[01:21:30]  And this Mexican guy  Is dropping knees on him  While he's out cold  Like throwing his whole body weight down  Bang  Over and over again  Bang  And the guy's making  The most disturbing noise  The guy who was unconscious  Is going  His body is just fucking  Because when you get knocked out  It's basically like  Your brain is just short circuited  And sent an electrical charge  Through your system  So all of his system  Is firing all fucked up 
[01:22:00]  All at once  And he's making all these  Crazy noises  And he's stiff  Because it's not regulated  Is that the fight?  Oh that's it  That's a trailer  From Felony Fights  Oh that's a trailer  From Felony Fights  There's three people  Going at once  Oh there's  Well some of them  I mean but the one that I saw  I've seen a couple of them  But the one that I saw  This is one white guy  And this Mexican guy  And the Mexican guy  He knew how to fight  And the Mexican guy  Beat the fuck out of this white guy  Is that Tracy Morgan?  Yeah  Felony fight  It's crazy  Someone's going to die in that  I've got to start going to these sites 
[01:22:30]  I don't know these sites  I've got to start fighting  Look at that  That's all night  You can watch that stuff  How can you not know that  These sites  Real real real fights  Yeah  These guys beat the fuck out of each other  Bare knuckles  What do they get?  Money?  I guess they probably pay him  You know what I mean  They must give him something  Yeah  Oh my  Look at that  Yeah  Dude  You don't even know  Because they don't stop the fights  The guys are unconscious  And they get smashed  Well they don't have to pay for reps  They pulled this guy off eventually  But he had already dropped  Like three or four knees  I mean talking about 
[01:23:00]  His whole body weight  Like leaping up in the air  And then dropping a knee  On this guy's fucking face  This is in the street  Yeah  Oh they fight everywhere dude  They do it in parking lots  The one that I saw  Was like in an apple orchard  These guys are in between trees  Beating the fuck out of each other  Look at this  Yeah it's pretty crazy man  Tattoos on his knees  Oh look at these guys  Look at her  Yeah  Well this is hard to listen to  What else we got  Oh I know  Look at this  Hey look at this  Look at this  People driving their car  Look at what  Fuck face  I thought they were all on the internet 
[01:23:30]  XM sucks  This is bullshit  Collabia  I got the bad version  Oh this is exciting radio  We got anybody else calling  Sure  Dave from Tennessee  What's your question?  Hey what's going on Joe?  What's up dude?  Listen  I mean I love the UFC  I do  But I think it's just gone too commercial  I mean back in the day  When it first started  They would fight three or four times a night  I mean that was fighting  You know men of men's there  Now I mean  But you kind of summed it up  A few minutes ago 
[01:24:00]  You said that they were in the hole  Now I kind of understand  Why they had to  You know change a few things  And make it more commercial  But I mean I just really enjoyed it  When they  You know  They would get in there and fight  And like I said  Three or four times a night sometimes  And build their way up  It's kind of interesting  But as an athlete  As a fighter  It's the worst way to do it  Because those guys  If they're fighting three or four times a night man  Like we've seen it in Japan  Japan still has tournaments pride  They'll still have  Like they have their  The middleweight grand prix  And the heavyweight grand prix  Where they make guys fight twice in a night  And you get fucked up dude 
[01:24:30]  And you got like an hour to recover  And guess what  If you break a foot  Or you break your shin  Or your hand  You're not going to be able to fight good  In the next fight  You're not going to be able to fight as well  So you're getting guys  They get hurt real bad  Then they have to fight again  So they don't get to put on the best performance  And it's not fair  Because one guy can win a fight  In ten seconds  With one punch  And the next guy can fight  A grueling decision fight  And be completely battered  And have those two fight in the finals  And it could have been a great fight  But it's not going to be now  Because one guy's all fucked up and injured 
[01:25:00]  And the other guy's fresh  Yeah  I mean that kind of makes it  A little more interesting  You know  And it kind of weeds  I feel it  It weeds out the  You know  The weaker ones  If you've ever fought before  You would understand  I've fought in taekwondo tournaments  Where you had to fight many times in a day  And taekwondo is nothing compared to the UFC  But you get hurt man  And then you have to fight like an hour later  And you're all fucked up  It's just  You can't compete at your best  And fighting is so fucking dangerous as it is  And these guys are spending  You know 
[01:25:30]  Six to eight weeks in these training camps  And they're fucking  They're doing plyometrics  And they're watching their diet  And they're running up hills  And they're doing constant drills  And they're trying to be in the best shape  And have the best technique they possibly can  Now when you're entering into this competition  And you're having to fight three and four times a night  It takes all that shit out of the mix  Now you're dealing with injuries  Now you're dealing with luck  Like one guy gets one punch in and knocks a guy out  And the other guy has to fucking fight a four round  Or a three round hard decision 
[01:26:00]  It's real hard  To fight more than once  I mean I agree  I mean yeah  I've fought some smaller venues  I mean I understand  It does take a lot out of you  But you know  There's a few changes  Like they went with the gloves  Now I understand that  You know to protect our hands  There was a lot of broken  You know fingers and what not  You know at the beginning  But I mean are they  What I'm saying is  Are they forcing them to do that  To put the gloves on  And you know  And also they went to rounds  You know  It was kind of fun  Just watching them go and go and go 
[01:26:30]  Until something  Until there was a winner  You know  There's something to be said  For having guys fight with no rounds  For sure  I understand what you're saying  I mean if you want to look at it  As like just a regular fight  Yeah I mean have a fight to the finish  No rounds  No judge  Like one guy taps out or doesn't  And you know what  That would be kind of interesting  If they had fights like that  Every now and then  The problem is  For the athlete man  I mean you get guys  That are real close  To each other's skill level  And you fight 
[01:27:00]  You know  You having guys  I mean  Hoist Gracie fought  Sakuraba in Japan  They fought for 90 fucking minutes man  And you have these kind of fights  Really  Where yeah  And you take some serious injuries man  And you can't fight again  You might not be able to fight again  For six months or a year  I mean  And you might not ever be  The same guy again ever  You might take  I mean  Two guys might have a decision  And they might fight  To a decision loss  But both those guys  Are ruined  Both those guys  They might have  Ripped ligaments  And get fucking brain damage 
[01:27:30]  And break their hands  And fucked their eye sockets up  You can get really badly damaged  And we have to think about it  As like  If a guy like Chuck Liddell  I want to see that guy fight  Like every few months  I want to see him fight  Every five, six months  Or whatever it is  He's not going to be able to  If you fight like that  If you fight like  As long as  You know  We wanted to  In the old UFCs  Where they had no time limit  There's no way  These guys are going to be able  To fight very often  You've got to think about  The health of the athletes  And to protect the athletes 
[01:28:00]  I think the rounds  And all that other stuff  I think it's a good thing  And I think  Giving these guys  Five minute rounds  And then letting them  Recover for a minute  It makes the fight  More exciting  Because they have more energy  When they come back  And they have more enthusiasm  When the second round  Third round starts  But I see what you're saying  I see what you're saying  The whole thing about money  You're talking about  Once you know  The guys that went in debt  44 million  You need sponsorship  You need endorsements  Well not only that  Pay per view  They have a window  They have a three hour window  In pay per view  And man  You could have a fucking  Three hour fight  With some of these guys  You know 
[01:28:30]  I mean two guys  That are really evenly matched  Fuck man  Especially if they know  There's no time limit  They might really pace themselves  You know  And it could get boring as fuck  Yeah that's true  Alright  Yeah maybe I'm just being  A little bit selfish  But it was fun to watch  It was fun to watch man  You could always just  Rent the DVDs  Yeah  Voss  Wipe your mouth off  You're slobbering  Are you talking to me bitch  Hold on  Did he hang up  He didn't have his headphones on  He said wipe your mouth off  You're slobbering  That's okay  I'm slobbering on the radio  How did you know 
[01:29:00]  Without your headphones on  He was talking about you  Because I'm the only slobber  In the room  Alright  Nobody else is spitting  It's like a Gallagher concert  When I talk  What else we got dude  Are these all fighting questions  Yeah  That's crazy man  That's how crazy the UFC is man  You talk about weed and drugs  Nobody gives a shit  Yeah  Rick  California  Go ahead man  Well hold on Rick  You don't have any questions  About how to get to  Governors at Levittown  Not a one  Let me check the instant feedback  Nope  None there either  Rick from California 
[01:29:30]  Go ahead  Ray probably  Sure you  What's up dude  Hey what's going on  Joe got a question for you  I've always like  When I first started  Watching UFC  I always liked watching it  Because it was  You know  You got to tell  Different kind of styles  And everything  I think recently  It's kind of gone towards  Well maybe  Not recently  But it's a lot more  Wrestling than anything  You know  These guys try to put themselves  On the ground  As fast as they possibly can  And there's like  Nothing to actually  Sit there  And you know  You can watch them wrestle 
[01:30:00]  But that's about the length  Of what you can do  As opposed to K1  Which fights  Are you talking about man  There's more stand up  In the UFC  Than anything  I think it doesn't go  To the ground enough  Well I don't know  Because I love watching K1  You know K1  Is nothing but stand up  K1's great  K1 is great man  But there is K1  I mean it's still an option  You can always just watch K1  If you don't like  Watching the ground  No that's fine  But you know  What I'm trying to do  Is I really want to enjoy  UFC  But it's just like I said  You sit there and watch them  30 seconds into the round  They're on the ground 
[01:30:30]  Wrestling  And then  You know  That's as far as you can  What's your name  What's your name  After a little bit of that  You just kind of  Tune it out  You know  Just like okay  Get up  Get up now  And swing some punches  That's what I want to see  What's your name  Ray  Yeah  This is Opie  Do you listen to the show  A lot Ray  Sure boss  Oh fuck  Well dude  I hear what you're saying  But I disagree  I think 
[01:31:00]  I like  I like watching the whole thing  I like watching  All the options  But a lot of those  Really good K1 guys  They're starting to bleed over  Into mixed martial arts  Mirko Krokop  Who's probably  One of the best guys  If not the best guy  In pride  Next to Fedor  I mean that guy  Is a top K1 striker  And you know  He's fighting MMA now  And Jerome LeBanner  Is on his way over  Peter Ertz  A lot of those guys  Mark Hunt  He's fighting in MMA  Now in Japan  So we're going to see  A lot of those guys  We're going to see  A lot of those K1 guys  Eventually make it  Into the UFC  Oh that's cool 
[01:31:30]  You know  Like I said  I want to respect the UFC  It's just  Like I said  All right  Shut up  We heard you  Hey everybody's different  Get rid of him  He said the same thing  Ten times  Shut up  I'll punch out  All right  I like how that guy  Was like  Didn't want to hurt your feelings  He was like  Why does it hurt  I don't understand  Well because he came on  He goes  Hi opening  Didn't he say  Yeah yeah  That's the kind of guy  I don't want to go to Amazon  And buy my DVD  Okay  Do not go buy it  For $19.95  At Amazon  What's the DVD called  Huh  What's the DVD called  You stink huh

[01:39:30]  It wasn't  It was about Atlantic City  Oh yeah I saw that one  Yeah  And none of them  Looked like Pretty Woman  Oh she was disgusting  She was like  Chick don't get the dick sucked  They get chicks sucked  She was angry  Yeah  Angry at her  People who give her money  Shipped sunglasses on  They don't get  They don't get  They get chicks sucked  They get chicks sucked  Have you ever been in Atlantic City  You don't want to fuck anything  In Atlantic City  No  Atlantic City is disgusting  Yeah  The girls down there  Oh my god  Chick suck by the way  They're the worst hookers ever  Oh yeah they're bad  Put the top of your mouth  On a cock and then  Just rub it with your hand 
[01:40:00]  If you can't fuck a normal girl  That you meet in Atlantic City  Give up  Don't go to no escort services  Atlantic City ain't a place  You're going to get some pussy  Yeah  Believe you or me  They have good carny pussy though  Actually I'll tell you one thing  You'd rather fuck a bowl of hepatitis  Than fuck these hookers there  I pictured a glass bowl  I don't know what you pictured  I pictured like one of those  Big glass bowls  That your grandmother would put  A fucking salad in  You just  Fuck it and watch yourself deteriorate 
[01:40:30]  A bowl of hepatitis  All right  That's the old  Two minute warning  We did two hours  And it went by  That was fucking fun man  See I'm telling you  A lot of people don't know  That even without Joe  Rich Voss can carry his own radio show  Rich Voss is a bad motherfucker  Ladies and gentlemen  Give him a show in Philadelphia  And still one of my best comic moments ever  Is Rich Voss telling that  Fucking Robbie Gibbons joke on stage  You can say it now  Say it  This is  We did this on the terrestrial show 
[01:41:00]  But we were in Dangerfield  This was fuck at least 10 years ago  More than that right  Yeah  Maybe 15  15 years ago  And Voss tells this joke downstairs  And I talked to him  And it said  On stage  After Mike Tyson  After broke up  Him and Robin Gibbons broke up  I found out that Robin Gibbons  Went out with Eddie Murphy  Michael Jordan  Mike Tyson  Is it me  Or is she a nigger lover  That was the joke  So he says this on stage  He was killing  He was killing up to this point  And nothing  They fucking stared at him 
[01:41:30]  And all you hear is me by the bar  You're listening to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  When Patrice is in studio  Oh do I have to say welcome back every time?  If you want to  Well then it becomes repetitive  Welcome back again  Happy?  When Patrice is in studio  Sometimes Opie and Anthony  Like to go through the top 10 country songs  Guessing  What the song is about  Based on the title 
[01:42:00]  Before actually listening  To the words of the song  These songs are current  When this bit originally aired  In 2006  Three fucking years ago  Almost four years ago  I hope you're not offended  By having to listen to this old shit  But listen anyway  You're listening to the worst  Oh wow  That's pretty cool  No not at all  Of Opie and Anthony 
[01:42:30]  Yeah because it's a piece of shit  We'll get some country songs  Yeah  That's what I want to do  Now don't mention number one  Or two or three  We got to count down  It's very exciting  To the radio audience  Yeah  When they're not sure  Which one number one is  So we count them down  We also  Play a little game here  With country music  Because we don't know  Country music  At all  We have a lot of people  Listening  That enjoy country music  And listen to it  Because we are  Nationwide  And Canadian  And all over the world  This fucking show 
[01:43:00]  Because it's such  An important program  And we don't know  What the country songs  Are all about  So we take the top ten  Country songs  And we look at the title  And then we try to guess  Through our stereotype  We have of country music  What the song  Could possibly be about  And then we play  A little of the song  And see who is correct  And that's our little game  It serves two purposes  It shows how stupid we are  As far as country music goes  And it gives the people 
[01:43:30]  That care  The actual countdown  Of the top ten country songs  And it shows how stupid  Country music is  Exactly  So the top ten country songs  In America  Starting with number ten  It's the band  Rascal Flats  Rascal Flats  And a song called  My Wish  My Wish  All right  I'm gonna  Just say  This is exactly  What it is  My Wish  It's the bands  Kind of  Telling what they wish  The world was like  Instead of what it  What it really is like 
[01:44:00]  Absolutely  Fucking absolutely no  Okay  Patrice never agrees  But let me tell you  Last time  Patrice  Knocked these out  Of the ballpark  I'm gonna challenge  Patrice today though  My Wish  My Wish is some  Pussy motherfucker  Who wants his dumb  Relationship to get better  And he's been  Fucking up  And he wishes  You can forgive me  For all the shit  I did  So my wish  Is that you  And then we can love again 
[01:44:30]  My wish  My wish  Almost like a song  Penny would write  My wish  My wish  Do Too Shy  Please  That made us all laugh  You're too shy  Shy  Hush  Hush  High  Too shy  Shy  Hush  Hush  Bling  You're too shy  Shy  Now my wish  Someone is dying  In this song  Oh  Someone's dying 
[01:45:00]  Holy shit  I didn't even think  Of that one  There's gonna be  A daughter left behind  That needs a little  My wish  This group is new  They're not touching  On that  That is old school  Good strategy  Death is old school  That's for an old school  Guy that don't give a fuck  These guys are like  This is an upbeat  You think it's upbeat  Upbeat  But how could it be upbeat  If he wants his chick back  That's what they fucking do  It's like they sing  The reverse blues  Like they stay  They can sing  Happy shit  But it'd be miserable  I think it's something  About world 
[01:45:30]  The way the world is  It's gonna be  It's gonna be slow  No fucking way  Country people  Sing about the world  They don't know  About the world  There's death  They were at the  Sting concert  They wish he never  Played that fucking  Lute again  And that there's  World peace  I say world peace  World peace  There's no fucking way  It's just  They don't know  These Kentucky boobs  They don't know  About the world  I like this  I like when we all  Have different ideas  Death and a kid  Involved  Death  Oh fucking dying kid  Not the kid dying  Death and a kid  It'd be good though  And the kid's  Gonna be left behind  You know something 
[01:46:00]  If it is death  I think you're right  I think death and a kid  But I don't think it is  Death and a fucking kid  And a kid's gonna be  Left behind with  Dead parents  It's not death  It's not death  It's absolutely not death  What are the odds  What are the odds  That the song's about  Poop shoots sex  My wish  Alright  That could be  Or maybe a girlfriend  For your relationship  Right  My wish  Patrice O'Neill  As written by  Patrice O'Neill  My wish  My wish is that  I can go knuckle deep  Lyrics and idea 
[01:46:30]  By Patrice O'Neill  My wish  That you'll see it my way  And I can bring a girlfriend  Into the relationship  Alright  Rascal Flats  My wish  Coming in at number 10  Rascal Flats  My wish  Let's see  It's slow  We're plotting  So I'm gonna say  And I wish  She wasn't my sister  Like  It's slow  I'm not sure  If I call that slow  It's slow 
[01:47:00]  I hope the days  Come easy  And the moments  Passed slow  And each road  Lead you where  You wanna go  And if you're faced  With a choice  And you have to choose  I hope you choose  The one  That means the most  To you  And if one door  Opens to another  Door closed  I hope you keep on  Walking  Till you find the window  If it's cold outside  Show the world  The warmth  Of your smile  Oh shit  But more  More than anything 
[01:47:30]  More than anything  Uh oh  Here we go  My wish  My wish  For you  Is that this life  Becomes  All that you wanted  Till your dreams  Stay big  Your worries  Stay small  You never need to  Carry nothing  And you can hold  And while you're out  There  Getting where  You're getting to  I hope you know  Somebody loves you  Yeah  Patrice is the closest  Here  Patrice is the closest 
[01:48:00]  It's not so much about  Nothing about cancer  Oh  It's not so much about  Him wanting to hook up  With this chick  Again  Or a break  Or even a break up  It's some chick  He's in love with  And just wishes  The best for her  So Patrice  I think is closest  Is it a daughter though  It's not about a kid  It could be either  With these motherfucking hicks  Daughter and lover  I see someone  Tapping his foot  In the other room  By the way  Who  Bring in Steve  Oh Steve  You fucking  Faggot  No Steve

[01:56:00]  So we got our answers in  Kinda  Yeah  We'll be able to  Figure it out  I say want to  Find true love  You say want to  Yeah it's still like  She wants to fuck  But she's married  Like is it  One night stand fucking  Or like  Real like  Well  With the chick  It's probably not  One night stand  Alright  And Patrice  Absolutely not a one night stand  Want to what  She might want a one night stand  She wants  She wants  We're all thinking sexier  She knows  Yes  Alright  She knows 
[01:56:30]  That he wants to  But she can't  He wants to  But she doesn't  Alright  You gotta speed us along  A little bit  Sugar Land want to  Uh oh  Number nine  In the  Country this week  Sugar Land want to  I packed a cooler  And a change of clothes  Let's jump and see  How far it goes  Uh oh  Uh oh  She packed up  She's on a date  Right  I don't know  You got my heart 
[01:57:00]  In your daddy's boat  We got on out  To make it  Flow  Stupid rhymes  Don't rhyme anything  We could sit on the show  Keep that flow into yourself  We could just be friends  We could jump in  The whole world could change  In a minute  Just one kiss  Cause life is spinning  We could think it through 
[01:57:30]  But I don't want to  If you don't want to  We could keep things just the same  Leave here the way we came  We're nothing to lose  But I don't want to  But I don't want to  If you don't want to  Uh platonic relationship  No she's a whore who needs guidance buddy  Jesus Christ  It's a rape fantasy  It's like  Rape fantasy  Listen to me  Where the fuck  I'll do anything 
[01:58:00]  Hold on that song  Cause you might have to go back to it  I don't want  Nigga I'm down  If you down  But I ain't gonna do it first  Cause you're not gonna blame me  For this shit going  Where it's going  So if you want to  I want to  Go ahead and do your thing  If you don't want to  I don't want to  If you don't want to  I don't want to  But I don't see it being as extreme  I'm seeing this  It's a platonic relationship  These people go out  They have fun  But now she's starting to think  You know  If they do it  They might ruin the friendship 
[01:58:30]  That they have  But if you want to  Go ahead  What the fuck  He's  He  Nah  Rape fantasy  She wants  Jesus Christ  I'm now with Patrice  She wants to fuck badly  But she doesn't want to look at it  As a whore  So she's waiting for him  To make the move  I don't think so  He's not making the move  So she's like  Alright if you don't want to  I don't want to  But she wants to  She wants to  Right in the poop chute  I'm thinking more  Calm down version of that  Right in her sugar land  They've been out there  They're fun  They've been having fun  They've been going out  It's not like  She's a fucking rapist  She just landed  She just told you

[01:59:30]  But she doesn't want to be  Looked at as the town  She said everything  She goes if he don't want to  She don't want to  Just to keep it the same  It'll be cool too  Yeah she also said  We have a relationship  But it's not cool though  But it is  She says it in the fucking song  But the reason I said  Ah these country assholes  The reason I said rape fantasy  Is not to be rape  Rape fantasy  Is just to  Exhume a woman from  Responsibility of  Right  Of fucking  Alright listen  She wants to fuck  This woman is fine  With the platonic relationship 
[02:00:00]  Or if it goes further  Either suits this bitch fine  But it's up to him  No  She's  He's holding her  And he's rubbing the top of her head  And her pussy's wet  And he keeps thinking  He has to rub the top of her head  And she wants him  To push her head down  Nigga make me do  Do something you faggot  I think  That's what she's saying  You know  I think it's the fucking  Scott Peterson  At the Modesto fucking marina  Hold on  With the boat  I just gotta peek at the chorus  This might  Oh good  Go ahead Dirk  See

[02:01:30]  This is a girl song  She's thinking  Friends are fine  If we're just friends  If you want to  Keep it that way  Fine but if we  Start kissing  Everything's gonna  Change  Think about how  Women run the world  Right now  Think about how  They run shit  Right now  You guys  And the strength  Of women  They can say  Look pussy  Come on man  You guys got this  So fucking wrong  Someone say  It's about high school  Kids and they had  That flirtatious  High school relationship  Can someone open fire  In this school then  Please  But now she wants  To fuck  She wants to  It ain't about 
[02:02:00]  Her fucking  It's a woman  Singing the fucking  Song  Here's more of the lyrics  I got your ring  Around my neck  In a couple of nights  I don't regret  You got a dream  Of a degree  And a shirt  That smells like me  Yeah we both  Got dreams  We should chase  Alone  Or we can make  Our own  She wants a relationship  She wants a relationship  She wants to fuck  She wants this  Motherfucker  She wants  Deep inside  Her sugar land  That's right man  You guys  You are reading this  So fucking wrong

[02:03:00]  She's fucking  Trying to  Holy fuck  Where do you get this  Where she's so adamant  About fucking  And doing everything  Because she  Because a woman  I want to  If you do  But if not  Women cannot just  Control the shit  Like that  She doesn't want  A guy  That she has to tell  To fucking make a move  She's like  Come on  You fucking  Sissy  I'm right here  My legs are open  Let's go  They have a fine  Relationship  Get into this  Redneck hole  They have a fine  Relationship  The way it is  But it's not 
[02:03:30]  Like love  Or anything  It's not fine  And she's saying  That if we do  Take that extra step  That other relationship  Is gone  There's no going back  Well yeah  She's scared a little bit  But it has nothing  To do with  Fucking double penetration  And fucking choking  On this guy's pump  Jesus Christ  Holy shit  Wow  We have to  We have to  Agree to disagree  Shut up  Dude she doesn't want 
[02:04:00]  To be known as a slut  So she can't make  The first move  The women can't  Make the first move  In general  Especially in  Country songs  Only on number nine  Who would say  If I want to  If you want to  Or if I want to  Who even says that  A girl  It's a girl song  You fucking idiot  But what is she giving  She's giving them  A little bit of confidence  It's like  Hey can I come  In your face  Can I come  In your face  Hey look  If you want to  She's explaining yeah  I would  I would  Have a relationship  With you or not  If you want to  Let's move on  If you want to  If you want 
[02:04:30]  You can do Spider-Man  You can do Spider-Man  If you want to  If you want to  Well again  We got to agree  To disagree  Alright  She really puts  The cunt in country  By the way  Mike from Denver  One of the last phrases  In the song  We didn't get to the end  Is but I want to  Thank you  Thank you  That's  But I want to  I want you  There is  The last  But I want to  But I want you  That's how the song ends  She wants  That's how the song ends  She wants some guy  That's her opinion of it  She wants a man 
[02:05:00]  I have to say  I have to say  The last line  Sheds a lot of light  I think  She wants some  I don't think she wants  I think she'd still be fine  If he said  She wants to  But  She's going through  The whole song  Saying if you don't want to  I don't want to  Who had that  No one saw that anyway  I forgot what anyone guessed now  After this heated debate  I know I was very wrong  You were very wrong  I was very wrong  Patrice is so far off  Into another galaxy 
[02:05:30]  No way man  I see it Patrice's way  This time around  Thank you man  Alright  Well we'll have to  Just let that one sit  The next one  Is  Brooks and Dunn  With Sheryl Crow  And Vince Gill  This is too easy  Building bridges  Building bridges  Come on  That's too easy  That's too easy  What is it  Big bridge  So a big park  Can be trucked  Into her  Pussy or some shit  An 18 wheel  Into Sheryl Crow's pussy  A dildo  On the front  Of an 18 wheel truck

[02:06:30]  With this lineup  You could be right  Liberal ass  Everyone loves each other  Everyone exactly  Yeah  And we're wrong  A little bit of  We're wrong  Thrown in there  We gotta build more bridges  Instead of  We understand  We're white  So we gotta be wrong  Yeah  I understand whitey  Sorry for what  I did  And my people too  Building bridges  Oh yeah  And you too  Well my granddaddy  Whipped your grandpappy  For that I'm sorry  We gotta build bridges  Unless they're building bridges 
[02:07:00]  Back to Africa  Because that sounds more like  A country song to me  We'll make the walk  A little easier  And the chorus is them  Just going  Damn this is a big bridge  Lucky Slide Smith  From Quorum  Ah dude  Just change the channel then  I don't know what to tell you  He writes  You guys are killing me  With this shit  Get this hillbilly shit  Just updated sorry  Oh go

[02:09:00]  Right on the head  Patrice  What else am I  Gonna do  There's the chorus  I think  Unless they do another verse  Alright here  I'm building bridges  Straight to your heart  Oh  And all of this distance  How you gonna fasten metal  To an organ  Like the heart  How do you rivet  A bridge  That's an awful 
[02:09:30]  Fucking cliche  But  Wow Patrice  You got that  100% on that one  I think you listen to this  At home  There's no way  I think you're  He's got it on his iPod  All you gotta do is know  It's just like if you watch  If you see  If we do rap or R&B  Yeah  Rock  You see the titles man  And you go with the theme  Of what they do  These motherfuckers  Are either in love or drunk  Yeah but that could be  Alright you're right  I was gonna say  That could be anything  And this is another thing  They're dumb  Their listeners are dumb  You can't be too intricate  Building bridges 
[02:10:00]  Building bridges  To your heart  To your heart  It's too simple  Yeah  Fucking some goofy truck driver  Driving down Route 1000  Is listening  He can't be trying to figure out  What the fuck is going on  He's busy  Route 1000  By the way  Brett in Brooklyn  Gee Opie  If you and Ann  Keep telling people  To quit listening to the show  Then eventually  You won't have any listeners  That's our goal  It is our goal  It's our goal  So none of you fuckers  Get up at 4.15  Every god damn morning  Bitch and complain  Alright here we go  The next one is Keith Urban

[02:22:30]  That's too religious  That is religious  Because Jesus take the wheel  Back in the day  Was uh  You know  Once or twice  You saved me  You saved me  There ain't no trucker  Listen to that  You saved me  It's not you saved me  It's you save me  Hmm  You saved me  You saved me  Continuing ongoing story of Jesus  Maybe  Maybe it's a typo  It's the old testament  And the new testament  Maybe it's supposed to be  You slave me  You  No  No  Wait  You know what it is 
[02:23:00]  It's  It's  It's the same premise  But it's a question  He's still a fucker  He's telling her  Like she said  Why don't  Why don't you stop  Having ass  Why don't you stop  Having ass sex  And he's like  I just want to keep fucking  I just want to have  Underage  Butt fucking  And it's like  You know  You don't want me to do it  You saved me  You saved me  Hey can I  Might be a tough sell  To the record label  Hold on  Really fast  Snap man  From whack bag  You saved me  From being on dateline 
[02:23:30]  You save me  Yeah  Wow that's a tough one  From a broken heart  You saved me  From a broken heart  I was you know  A save though  Yeah  But it's save  It's not past tense  Or maybe she continues  Saving him  Like she's constantly  Saving him  That would be  You're saving me  Like he keeps  Like  You saved me  Like I think about  I think about  This nasty shit  But you saved me  You you know  I think about going out  I think about drinking 
[02:24:00]  I think about fucking  I think about this  But you saved me  That's what I'm going with  I'm sticking to it  Alright let's see  What this is about  Kenny Chesney  You saved me  Now you saved me  This might be a Jesus song  That sounds very Jesus  Every now and then  I get a little lost  My strings all get tangled  My wires all get crossed 
[02:24:30]  Every now and then  I'm right upon the edge  I'm dangling my toes  Out over the edge  I just thank God you're here  I'm right  Cause when I'm a bully  Shot out of a gun  Cause when I'm a firecracker 
[02:25:00]  Coming undone  When I'm a fugitive  Ready to run  All wild out and crazy  Jesus nigga  Get to your meeting  You motherfucker  Reckless soul takes me  Baby you stay  Wow  Right on the fucking head  Who the fuck cares  Right on the head  I hit that motherfucker  Oh my god  You can sit in three words 
[02:25:30]  You saved me  Get to it  Every so often  Bitch I fuck up  Thanks for being there  Jesus  Here's flowers  Really on those fucking flowers  Beating your flowers again man  This is all your songs  It's like you're bringing home  A punch in the eye  You know  The flowers  I've been with you  For forty years  And your lips  Still look like  Bowls of pears  You saved me 
[02:26:00]  You saved me  Here's some flowers  So we can get out of here  Before noon  All right Carrie Underwood  We're up to Carrie Underwood  Oh boy  I got number four  Before he cheats  Before he cheats  Is the title  He's gonna give her ass sex  Before he cheats  Thank you finally  Ass sex  Before he cheats  Before he cheats  Before he cheats  Before he cheats  Before he cheats  This is a girl who wants to bring  A girlfriend home  For the relationship  Before he cheats  Boy this could go in many ways  She ain't singing about this 
[02:26:30]  Because remember she was saying  Jesus take the wheel  So you gotta figure out  Some real positive shit  Out of this  You know what  No  I think she's getting the fuck  Out of this relationship  She sees it coming  Before he cheats  She's gone  Because she knows he's a cheater  There's no other thing  It could be  Other than that  You think that  It's not even another  Fucking  Absolutely that's what it is  She's getting the fuck out  She's getting out  She's better than this  She sees he's gearing up  She's getting out  Before he cheats  Because what else is she gonna do  Before he cheats  I'm gonna fucking  It's my fault  She's gonna get  She's thinking  I'm gonna blow 
[02:27:00]  She's gonna get freaking  Like I'm  I can't see her singing  That it's my fault  I'm the problem  Her being a woman  She's not gonna sing  That gay women  Look out  You fuck up  He's gonna cheat  She's a one position  She's a one position  Jane  And she's finally gonna  That's it  Do a couple new ones  She's gonna do it  Yeah  She's gonna let him do a fucking  All right  Do a little quest for fire  With the booty  Suck his dick before he cheats  She's gonna be a big  Big fat girl  Gonna drop a few pounds  Before he cheats  Yeah get on that treadmill  Yeah before he cheats  I'm enjoying curves  He's doing shit 
[02:27:30]  That's leading up to  Yeah it's leading up  And she's out of there  Before he cheats  I think for like country girls  Getting punched in the face  Is before cheating  Right  Like usually  For anybody else  East coast  You cheat  Then punch in the face  Fucking country girls  Okay now  He punched me in the face  Punches okay  He stuck something in my ass  But you know what  I'm out of here  Before he cheats  Cheating's on it's way  Yep  Yeah that's what it's about  So where is it  It's uh 
[02:28:00]  She's out of here  She sees what's coming  And before he cheats  Goodbye motherfucker  She's gone  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Let's do it  Nothing to do with  I'm going with  You gotta love him  The right way  Before he cheats  That's where I'm going  You gotta love him  The right way  Almost like a  Stand by your man  Bullshit  Kind of like a  Danny Wynette  Little self deprecation  Going on there  Little crawl back  And she just knows  She's better than this guy  She's with  That's what I'm saying  Boring  I like your point  But I don't think 
[02:28:30]  That's what it's about  Women are too empowered  These days  They really gotta start  Singing about poop  Shoot sex  About ass sex  Boy we'd be buying  Like crazy  It's two up  It is  She's out of here  Listen that's  Bitch walking away music  And collecting things  Collecting her shit  Fuck you motherfucker  Before you cheat  You're gonna give it all away  I'm picking it with me  Right now  He's probably slow  Dancing with a beach  Blonde tramp  And she's probably  Getting thirsty  Right now 
[02:29:00]  He's probably  Buying her  Some fruity  Little drink  Cause she can't  Shoot a whiskey  Right now  He's probably  Up behind her  With a blue stick  Showing her  How to shoot a condo  Oh man  And he don't know  I dug my key  Into the side  Of his pretty  Little cooked up  Four wheel drive  Called my name  And who is  Led to see  I took a room 
[02:29:30]  With his sweater  To both headlights  And smashed a home  And all four tires  And maybe next time  I'll pay  What a lunatic  Wow  She beat the shit  Out of his fucking truck  And maybe he'll think  Twice before he cheats  This guy ain't thinking  I thought she was leaving  He's cheating  And he don't give a shit  What you do to his shit  I had part one  Now why wouldn't he  Bring this chick home  And introduce him  Why doesn't 
[02:30:00]  Why doesn't she just  Take the  He'd take this girl  To where this other girl works  Because  Listen  Sometimes  This girl likes  To do those things  Hey bitch  I asked you to play pool  You don't feel like it  This is my pool chick  Yo this chick  Hey come on  Hey let's everybody get  Instead of fucking  With my keys  Let's all get into this truck  Right now  He's probably doing radio  On the Opie and Anthony show  Right now  Little Jimmy Norton's not in

[03:01:30]  Oh man  Imagine hearing that in a joint  Oh shit  Hey look  This is the only time  This is the only time  You can talk shit  To Opie and shit  When Jimmy ain't got his back  You  You  You  You know what  Jimmy always using college words  College words  Jimmy doesn't  Jimmy doesn't get my back  Jimmy's got my back  You think  Jimmy always got your back  Patrice has got my back  Right Patrice  Not often  Jimmy always got your back  All right Sarge  Jimmy always got your back  Hey but I got love for you white motherfuckers too 
[03:02:00]  All right Sarge  You alright  You alright  Wow  Oh god damn  All right now this stuff is coming in  John from Brooklyn  We're learning  What's going on  We want to learn about the black man today I guess  What's up John  Yeah I want to know  What about each other  Why when the brothers  Why do they wear on their hat  The size  Of what their head is  When they get a brand new hat  Or even a hat in general  This isn't just blacks  Whites do it too  They'll have like this  Seven and a quarter  Stick is still on  It's to do anything 
[03:02:30]  I have a theory on it  Oh well you talk about it  We were just going to have Patrice explain it  But you ask the question  And give the answer  Go ahead  I'm sorry  No I'm just saying  The real reason  Is to do anything  That's completely not  Like okay  I'll tell you immediately  How you know  It's a white guy's hat  Uh huh  Immediately  It's bent  It's bent  It's bent  Yeah  We know that  It's fucking bent  But the white guys  Are starting to go with the flat  With the flat  But not really white guys  Hip guys who are claiming hip hop 
[03:03:00]  It's not as much as a color thing  As a cultural thing  Anything  To not be white  Right  So keeping your sticker  No matter how ridiculous it looks  I think it's fucking retarded  I don't wear my sticker on my fucking head  I've seen the tags in the bill  Hanging, dangling in people's faces  And it's not to take it back  It's to take it back  Because I've seen old ones  With the sticker on it  Right  It's like nigga  There's a sweat line  On top of that motherfucker  You got the sticker  You're not bringing that back  He wants to take it back  After three years of use 
[03:03:30]  Man, I gotta tell you  I don't  You got to bring it back  On a Hartford Whalers hat  I don't get the baseball cap  That's straight across  I think it looks ridiculous  My theory  Is that  When you walk it through the mall  It's a hat store  You take it right off the rack  And slap it on your head  It's like it's just stolen  Like I just took this hat  And that's it  Why does it have to get to theft  Sir?  Because  Just stolen  This hat's brand new  I took it  It's just like Patrice said 
[03:04:00]  It's anything  That is going to make  White America look  And go  Why are they different?  Why do they have to do that  And be different?  It's to be different  Than white America  A couple more  Let's go to Bill in Georgia  Bill  Hey, what's up man?  What up?  Yeah, I got a question  What's up with him  Saving up for 15 years  To put rims on a 14 year old  Monte Carlo  That old gag  It's not an old gag  I don't get it either  I don't see really old cars  Why the nice rims  On the cars?  Why?  The rims are worth more 
[03:04:30]  Than the fucking cars  You gotta have a nice car  These days though too  You can't just  It's not about  You know, I remember  Years ago it was  You would see a real piece of shit  With nice rims on it  Yeah, but nowadays  You just get laughed at  What's up with the rims in general?  I don't get it  When I look at a nice car  I don't even look at rims  Nice feet, nigga  Same thing you have  Nice, clean shoes  They do  Wait, listen man  White people  No, they don't  No, we don't  White people  Black people have this  Unknown thing  Where we all know the same shit  But we don't 
[03:05:00]  Reach out to each other  It's virile  In your genetics  It's in our genetics  That's why I said  It's the same reason  Why like  A riot  How can a riot break down  Unless everybody feels the same?  No one goes  Alright everybody  Start fucking up shit  It just  It just happened  Alright everybody  Call a friend  Pass it on  Cheer cause OJ  It's like you don't  You don't announce that  What happens is  When I  You just want to be  As nice as possible  And be  That's why rappers  Are like heroes 
[03:05:30]  Because  Like these two arguments here  Like the fucking  The Tony and  Yeah  My man  It's because  You feel like  You have to be  This type of negro  To be upwardly mobile  But rappers  Have made motherfuckers  That walk around  With a tattoo  On their neck  On their eyelids  Say suck my dick  Nigga  Here's what I'm gonna do  I'm gonna buy  A motherfucking  Phantom  Which is the real car  That the  Chrysler 300's  Trying to be  A Phantom  For $250,000  And nigga  I'm gonna put 
[03:06:00]  $10,000 worth of rims  On that motherfucker  To make it look  To match my  The inside of my  Fucking dashboard  Bitch  It's saying  To you  Motherfuckers  Suck my dick  It's saying  I can  You know what  My clothing  Costs as much  As a nigga's suit  When he goes to  Wall Street  Motherfucker  My jeans  And my motherfucking  Seattle superstar  And my hat  My coogee hat  Come up to about  As much as a white boy  Walking around  In the street  And I'm very proud  Of that  I'm very proud 
[03:06:30]  That's your suit  That's my fucking suit  I don't have to feel  Like I go to court  And I  Every day's casual  Day for me  Bitch  I'm niggering it up  But now  A white guy  Would walk by  And not know  From a fucking  Hole in the wall  But any black guy  Is gonna walk by you  And go  That motherfucker  Paid some money  For this shit  He knows this is sharp  This coogee hat  Nigga gonna know  This hat's sharp  Man  It's not a  It's just  It's our way  Of not being you 
[03:07:00]  But being you  In your own  Circle  With that said  We go to  God damn  I'm gonna have to  Take notes on  Today's show  I gotta listen to  Replay and write  All this down  Russ in Ohio  It leads to this  Question  You guys have  Gotta have  Patrice on  More often  I'm learning  More about  Black people  Than I ever  Wanted to know  I've got a  Question for  Patrice  Why is it  A black guy  Can wear an  Oversized jersey  And a hat  Sideways  Looks cool  Morton does it  He looks like  He's with  Special Olympics  He looks like 
[03:07:30]  He has cancer  Because it's not  You can feel that  Norton's really  Would never be  A part of that  Norton  Is tight jeans  And dark  Martin boots  That's what  Norton is  He has a  Tight jeans  Dark Martin  Build  And there's a  Certain walk  You have to  Have to pull  Things off  Sabbath t-shirt  I'm trying to  Think about the  Blackest person  You got around  That can almost  Be  Danny  Danny has the  Movements  And the  Attitude of a  Black man  Really  Danny  He kind of 
[03:08:00]  Looks a little  Black  He has a  He has a  Swagger that's  Black  It's a  It's a thing  That Danny  Could pull off  Black shit  He could pull it  Off  Because he has a  Thing about him  But like  I think because he  Lives among the  Brothers  I don't know what  It is  But Danny  Has a thing  It's an attitude  It's an attitude  You live among  The Brothers  Danny  Sort of right  More than like  E-Rock does  More than I do  Danny's a cornball  But he has a  Thing with him  He has a thing 
[03:08:30]  With him  He's like a  Cool dude  What nationality  Are you by the way  Like Russian Jew  Actually  Wow  That's odd  You should have  Danny dress up  Like a black dude  And see if he  Pulls it off  And I think he would  But like look at  E-Rock man  He's just  He's the whitest  Guy ever  Look at he's  Beaten  Look at his  Shoulders  His shoulders  Scrape the ground  His self esteem  Is in disarray  He just  He desperately  Doesn't want to be  Black  And Danny 
[03:09:00]  Not Danny  E-Rock looks in the  Mirror and wishes  He could move  Like something  Other than  What y'all made him  He's just a sad  Soggy kid  And he doesn't  Want to be like that  Soggy  If he wasn't a  Grown man  That's a high school  Shooting  Waiting to happen  It's fucking  E-Rock  You just want to  Smack his hat off  But you see a  Nigga walking  You don't feel like  You want to slap him  But see I'm not  Going to front  And I've said this  Before  I know how  Black I am 
[03:09:30]  I'm black enough  To go up to  The high hundreds  In Manhattan  Maybe  145th  Go around the room  How high up  Could we all go  For the people  Around America  Wow  That's pretty good  Wait wait wait  For the people  Around America  It's a known fact  Like if you're white  You don't go past  100  More or less  Usually you want to  Stay down in the 90s  But you know  Once you go into  100  You go up 
[03:10:00]  You go past 100  It starts getting scary  But it's a certain  Look though  Alright so  Go around the room  And how you  Handle yourself  How you walk  Things like that  And your face  It's like the  Thousand yard stare  What your face is  We're on 57th Street  Right now  How much higher  Could all of us go  I'm gonna lie  Obi  Your face  You better go  Downtown right now  You're too high  Right here  Wherever the  Wiesenthal Center is  Where it's  Where it's kind of  Funny  Uptown  Like you might  Get to 100 
[03:10:30]  To some kind of  Like little  Trendy bar  Weird nook  Up there somewhere  Yeah  We did a photo shoot  Up there for  Boston  Yeah  A pull out for  A Boston newspaper  And they had us  How high up man  That was scary  We were scared  We were pretty high up there  Yeah  But anyway  I would say 120  Because 125  Is becoming  Gentrified  Yeah  But any place  Where you know  There wasn't a bunch  Of white people  That lived there  Was it  You could never go  To 130  Like you couldn't 
[03:11:00]  130 is bad  You would be uncomfortable  What's up with 130  That's where  I thought 100  Was scary  They'd smell the fear  On you  Yeah  And they could see  Your hips move  Like somebody who  Roller blades  When you walk in shoes  You really  You move your hips  Like a nigga  That  You couldn't go  Past 130  He could go  Past 130  And above  Because people  Would think  Anthony's a cop  He looks  He looks grizzled  And  He has a grizzled  Like a narc  Look he does  He was  Eric 
[03:11:30]  Not past 125  He's another one  Then  It's possible  He could go up  To 145  To 150  Because they would  Think he was  A fucking cop  Or  A college kid  That  Even  Gangsters  Wait a minute  Even  Gangsters  See  You would get  Robbed  Before fan  Or before  E rock  Because  Black people  And Puerto Ricans  Know that  That prey on people  You would get  Too much heat  Around the neighborhood  If you did  Something  To somebody  Like fan  Walking around 
[03:12:00]  Your neighborhood  Almost like  The Charles Stewart  Situation  Where that's why  You know  That black people  Didn't kill  Charles Stewart  Because no black  Man would kill  A fucking  White  A pregnant  White woman  The hardest  Nigga wouldn't  Kill a pregnant  White woman  In the hood  So  You might get  Robbed  When that story  Came out  You're like  Oh my god  You're like  Nigga  Get the fuck  Out of here  Ain't no  Niggas  Don't  Niggas  Don't do that  Don't  They're not  Robbing no  Pregnant  Fucking  White woman  In a  Volvo  In the hood  It don't  Happen

[03:32:00]  Because I always have nice shit  But live in the projects  Because you can afford  To have nice shit  When you live in the projects  Before I bought a house  Before I bought a house  My rent was $4.92  It's simple economics  If you walk into my bedroom  I had a 47 inch computer monitor  You see this Seattle  Sonics  Here's what I used to do  When I had a roommate  I threw away  T-shirts  When I wear it  I'd throw it away 
[03:32:30]  One time  That's it  One time I would wear it  And throw it in the garbage  Now  Oh man  Ever since I've come into White World  See  Welcome to White World  I clean my sneakers  I used to get my jeans  Dry clean all the time  So if you  Because every month  You have an escalade  Here's what you can do  When you  This  The fireman  What you can do  Is you have your escalade  You pick your bitch up  Right  A bitch you just fucking  You don't need to take him  To the house  You know what I'm saying 
[03:33:00]  So you take him to the hotel  Because you can afford it  Because you don't pay  That much rent  At the projects  And you go home  And you play your video games  Your boys come over  Because they all live  In the same building  Y'all smoke weed  You play  And in the projects  A nigga can have a house  By himself  Like a  A 17 year old kid  Can pay the rent  In the projects  So he has a 72 inch TV  He has a fucking  Stainless steel refrigerator  He has a pit bull  And he has his escalade  He takes bitches  To the hotel  To fuck them  And he sleeps  And that's why 
[03:33:30]  You  It's such a nice thing  But when you go  Into White World  Yeah  You learn what  Leeson is  You learn what  Fannie Mae is  You learn what  Blasey this is  Interest rates  Freddie Mac  You know what it is  You know what the fuck it is  And your mindset changes  That's why you go into Bricks  And see some really nice shit  But you're like  Why is there piss everywhere  Because you know what  His is inside my house  You never  Let me tell you when it changed  When that shit changed  When they start putting  Roofs  On the projects 
[03:34:00]  When they start putting  Pointy rules  Instead of making them  It makes people feel  Like it's their home  The projects  Don't feel like your home  So you go like  Fuck this elevator  I'm pissing it  But you go in  Your particular little area  And it's kind of nice  Or whatever  Or the landlord  You're not responsible  You're not responsible for anything  It's not  It's what they call  Burden of ownership  There's no burden of ownership  It's like  Nigga don't  Nigga don't  Put your feet on my couch  That's your shit  Don't put your fingers  On my TV  That's your shit 
[03:34:30]  But you know what  Piss on the floor  Because it ain't my shit  Piss in the elevator  Shit in the stairwell  When you get in my truck  Motherfucker  I'm sorry  You ever see  I watch people  White women  For some reason  Decide they take their shoes off  And they put their feet  On the dashboard  Of a car  Yeah  Do that in a nigga's car  Like  Bitches  Your empty  Stinking ass foot  On my dashboard  Of my Escalade  Get your ashy feet  On my fucking  It's a priority thing man  It's like  But you can't judge us  Don't judge us  It's just like  It took me a few years

[03:47:00]  Fucking  I turned around  I know Dane  Yeah  I turned around  I go  Is Dane famous  That's what I would ask people  What happened  Is Dane famous  I know him  I have his number  Is this  This motherfucker  Is he a household word  People seem to be talking about him  I turned around  And there's a finger  That's his  Super finger  Sufi  That's a conglomerate  It's more money than Viacom  And I'm like  When did this happen  What  At what set  At the Laugh Factory  On fucking Sunset Boulevard 
[03:47:30]  Did this fucking happen  The minute I stepped away  From the table  At the cellar  That is really  Oh shit  That really is  And here's the sad thing  That's inside  But really good  Yeah  It's  There's a lot of bitterness  At that back table  It's just  When  I'm going to tell you  Where a lot of this comes from  And it's not from  Because  From Tough Cry  When Tough Cry was on  It was  It was me  Norton  Nick  Colin  And we kind of got  And Voss  Yeah  He made sure 
[03:48:00]  Not to forget Voss  Because that's really  You can feel it  And Voss  Voss  And  But we used to sit around  And just like  You stink  You loser  You this  You that  And  And a lot of comics  Are not privy to that shit  Like they don't like  That whole loser  You suck  You ain't shit  So it's like  Let me get away from that  And get into some  Positive thinking  But here's the thing  That's what Dane is  Is positive thinking  Some of the guys  That try to subscribe  To Dane Cookology  Are losing  Like Fat Boy  Like Bobby Kelly 
[03:48:30]  Who's starting to look like  Emeril Lagasse  Who has to understand  He's a fucking loser  He is not to hang out  With positive vibes  He's to be with losers  And stay with losers  And he'll find success  No one wants to be around  This fat balding man  Who has this evil look  In his eyes  These black eyes  Lifeless eyes  Like a doll's eyes  Like a doll's eyes  You made one mistake  You said balding 
[03:49:00]  He's actually bald  And I'm telling you  Dane  No more  Dane has a lot of guys  It's the side  It's the dark side  And it's the light  Now Dane is succeeding  On the force  The light side  Of the force  But there's a lot of guys  Who think they should be  Living on the force side  Who aren't living on  Like Gary is an angry man  Gary Goldman  Because he  He should be on the force  Side  And it should be  His life should be cultivated 
[03:49:30]  But he's mean and mad  And if he accepts that  He could be a Sith Lord  If he accepts his evil  He will be fantastic  Dane is nice  Dane's playing the garden  Of course he is  Dane's playing the garden  It's probably on the way  To something else  He's dropping through  At the garden  Dropping in  Yeah  It's like  You know what  Dane's MySpace send button  Is like  Fucking getting ready  To launch a missile  Like it's like 
[03:50:00]  Alright Dane  Are you sure you want to do  Ohio State University  Yes  Bop  You sure you want to do  The state of Kansas  Dane Cook is performing  Tonight  One night only  Dane performs  In Minneapolis  Minnesota  We're at  In Minneapolis  Where  Nigga  Minneapolis  He puts out a bulletin  On the MySpace  Hit send  And all the lights dim  Like all the power  That's why MySpace  From the internet  Is getting soaked up 
[03:50:30]  You're like  Oh Dane must be  Putting out a bulletin  Me and my 1700 friends  Oh shit  Dane's friends  Can gang rape my friends  Oh  And they couldn't fight it  Oh that's funny  Because everyone else  Got involved with the MySpace  Way too late  They saw what it did  Yeah Dane got in  Like really early  You gotta be in early  Dane who fucking  Told you about that  Don't even tell me  That you were sitting there  Going  This looks like a good  Place for me to  I was on Friendster  And a fan 
[03:51:00]  Wrote me and was like  Dude doesn't this suck  And I was like  Yeah and he goes  You should check this out  So I skipped over to  MySpace early on  Do you owe that guy  Money now  I don't know who that is man  But you know  That son of a bitch  Man he gave  He gave you a great tip  You don't know  You know the guy Tom though right  The guy that runs it right  You must know  Yeah those guys  I mean  God I'm glad  Yeah  He's worth like  580 million dollars  Or something  Unbelievable  Dane is slacking though  He only has 1.5 million friends  Oh that's it  What's with that nigga  What's with that Dane 
[03:51:30]  There are countries  That don't have those populations  Dane has India as a friend  Dane's like a country now  Dane has Tibet  Welcome to Dane  Come to Dane  You got a passport  You can't get into Dane  To Dane  Unbelievable  Dane Cook  Ladies and gentlemen  I will soon be arriving in Dane  The weather is perfect  Of course  As it is every day  So fasten your seatbelts  And prepare for landing  And enjoy your time in Dane 
[03:52:00]  Patrice O'Neal  You coined it man  You said the thing though  At the back of Nick's one day  When everybody was  Everybody was trying to be something  They weren't on stage  I remember you looked at me dude  And you go  I'll tell you man  The thing that's going to make you  Make it  And he goes  You can't fuck with the truth  And that's all I ever did man  I was like  Alright fuck it  I'll just be myself  I'm not going to try to bust balls  If I don't want to bust balls  And really  Patrice is one of the guys  That actually was  You know  He got me  He got me right away  So a lot of comics  Try to be something they're not  A lot of comics 
[03:52:30]  That's why I tell  I tell  That's why I tell  I know how to make  Bobby Kelly famous  He's  See  Dane's fame is different  Than Bobby's fame  He's not  Like certain people  Have certain kind of fame  Man  I could never be  Dane famous  I would do  My personality  Would do something  To horrifically  Fuck up my fan base  Like I would just tell him  Go fuck yourself  With your god damn finger  Stick these two  Sufis up 
[03:53:00]  You fucking cunt  Or  Get out of my  You know what  I'm tired of the  Madison Square Garden  It'll be  13,000 people  Going what  He's having a  Lurus breakdown  Hey  Get him out of here  Go suck a dick  I know where  My bread's buttered  My bread is not buttered  I might make a million  Throwing out a heckler  In like section 304  But Dane  The thing I tell Dane  Because a lot of  Old school guys  Hate Dane  Old school motherfuckers  Right  Hate Dane  And I'll go  Look let me tell you 
[03:53:30]  Something man  This motherfucker  And I say this  And this is not  No bullshit man  I don't  You know me man  No  He's righteous  I say to  Motherfucker  We had a long talk  One of these  A long time ago  Last long talk we had  And Dane  Did two things  Well I remember  I said Dane  Look man  Because he told me  All this heavy shit  About himself  I said  You don't talk about  This shit on stage  He goes  I have no interest in it  Maybe in a movie  Maybe  But I would never  Talk about that  Deep down hurting shit  On stage  I went 
[03:54:00]  Fair enough  And then he  Proceeded to go  You know  I'm tired of people  Stealing from me  And Jim Carrey  And that's when  I wish it was  Somebody else there  For me to look at  And go  What?  That conversation  That was the last  Heart to heart  We like had  But that's why  I go  That motherfucker  Is righteous  Whatever he's doing  It's him  Don't do  Fucking  Somebody else  Right  Bobby Kelly  I love Bobby  I tell him this  All the time 
[03:54:30]  You're not  A guy  People love  So what  What is the adjustment  That Bobby needs  To make then  He needs to stop  Talking about  Butter cookies  And cheese whiz  On stage  Cause Bobby  Is a deviant  Problem person  But he can't  Deal with  No laughter  Bobby needs  The laughs  That Dane get  Bobby needs  That  But Bobby  Needs to learn  How to not  Be funny  For a second  So that he can  Deep deep  Go deep down  Into what the  Fuck problems 
[03:55:00]  He has  As an ex  Good looking guy  Like  Oh man  I was  I was watching  Torgasm  The other day  And I saw the episode  Where you guys  Look back  Yeah  And holy shit  There was some  Videos  Some old videos  Of Bobby  Yeah  With that  Jerry curl  Motherfucking hair  Or whatever the hell  Bobby was sexy  Man  Rico suave  He was  Rico suave  He was like a young  Marlon Brando  He was fucking sexy  Bobby was tremendously sexy 
[03:55:30]  Sexy Bobby  He really  You should see his old  Headshot at the cellar  You go  Holy  What a pretty man  He is  P  Bobby was pretty  He was like a male  Angelina  I used to bring  Girls  This was my  Like my litmus test  I used to bring  Girls that I liked  Down to like  Remington's  Or the vault  Or whatever  And like  Then they would  Meet Bobby  And then Bobby  Would like  Go fuck my chick  And that's what  I knew  I wasn't with  The right girl  Bobby  He still has  That charm  But Bobby 
[03:56:00]  Lost a little bit  Of the charm  Because Bobby's  On a mission  Of positivity  Now  And he's  Losing  Dude  You know  Life is like  A box of  Onion rings  You know  When he came  When he came in  The first few times  He would talk about  How deviant a lifestyle  He was leading  And then he'd start  Talking about  I'm talking to people  And I just want to  Get a little more  Positivity in my life  He's trying to figure it out  So he's trying to  Yeah  He's trying to  Dane  Is that  What Dane does  Is what he does  What I do  I try  Let me tell you something 
[03:56:30]  Everybody tries to be Dane  At one point  They try positivity  I tried positivity  In 98  It almost killed me  I liked it  I was in there  I was in a room  By myself  With two Whoppers  Sitting on my stomach  Because that's all  I could afford to eat  And I said  If I had a gun  I'd blow my fucking brains out  Because I'm in here  Skipping around  And like Jamie Masada  That owns the Laugh Factory  Come body  With his dry skin 
[03:57:00]  And talking to you  And I'm going  Hey Mr.  Hey  How are you man  Good to see you  You creepy Iranian  It's like  Nah  It's like  My thing is to go  Get the fuck  Out of my face  That's  It's like  I would never  Hang with you  But people  People think that  You say that  Patrice  Because you're  Afraid of success  And that's why  You take that route  I used to be  I fucking was  That person  That goes  Oh man  I'm tired of this  You know  What I'm afraid of 
[03:57:30]  No  Getting a little too close  Yeah I want  I want it  But also at the same time  I know me  The success  That I want  Is the one  That gets to say  To somebody  Eh yeah  Look  I really  This is dumb  Yeah I mean because  It's a different yeah  Things out of the stand up world  You have to be collaborative  And that means  Fucking putting on  Business hat  For more hours of the day  Than the fuck off hat  And so  That's the thing Patrice  I don't think a lot of people  Think that you can do that  I probably 
[03:58:00]  He's getting better at it  I've seen it even in the short term  This daffy bastard  Has gotten himself  A good credit rating  He's bought a house  This is shit that years ago  One step at a time  Years ago  And he's talking about things like  He's talking about things like  Sitting in a room  At a closing  And you know  I call it the  Whitification of Patrice  It's a little  You know  He's just entering  A whole new world  Patrice  Let me tell you something  That credit rating  That's like 
[03:58:30]  Sitting at the blackjack table  You don't want to lose  That shit  No  Your life hinges on it  At some point  If you reach a certain level  Of success  Where you're out of  The rented house  Out of  Your friends coming over  In the rented house  Trashing it with beer cans  And stuff  When you move up  To actually buy a house  Things like credit ratings  Come into play  And you're like  Ugh  But look at you guys though  You're  What you  Like what you were before  Like you  You take  You take less L's  Than you used to take  Before  Like before  The fucking chapel shit 
[03:59:00]  You motherfuckers  Would you know  Have somebody  Fuck a horse  In Times Square  That's true  And you'd get  Threatened to be fired  You'd be laughing  It's awesome  But now you can see  You motherfuckers  Go  Oh lord  You get slaving  Lord and lord  We don't want news  The master says  Those words ain't  Supposed to be used  But nice  Is not my basis  For why I'm funny  Ever  In my life  Yeah  And you know that  It's been pain  And I can't  I just can't 
[03:59:30]  Figure out how to be funny  Without pain  So I have to make it  So that's nothing  That's nothing wrong with that  No  It works  But it works for someone  It works for you  And I know it works for me  And how's um  How's Billy Bird doing  After that uh  YouTube thing that I watched  They don't know  They won't call  I would love to talk to Billy  I don't know  You know his number  I don't have his number  My cell phone is broke  And you know something  Billy Bird never gave me  His phone number  And I never gave Billy  My phone number  I don't know what has  You don't have my phone number  I don't have Patrice's phone number  She calls you here
