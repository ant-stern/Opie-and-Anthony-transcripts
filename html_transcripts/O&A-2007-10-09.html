<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured comedian Patrice O'Neal as a guest throughout the entire program.  The show opened with a discussion about sports, specifically the Yankees' playoff elimination, Joe Torre's future, and Roger Clemens' performance.  This segued into a debate on what constitutes a "sport," ranging from baseball and hockey to soccer (which was heavily disparaged) and NASCAR, even touching on equestrian events.  A caller's comment about NASCAR's moonshining origins sparked a discussion on whether activities stemming from illegal acts can be considered sports.  The conversation then shifted to a sexual harassment lawsuit against Isaiah Thomas and Madison Square Garden, with Patrice providing comedic and provocative commentary, including absurd analogies and solutions to workplace harassment.  A recurring "80s New Wave Tuesday" segment featured a Human League song, punctuated by humorous commentary on musical knowledge.  Jim Norton's appearance on Jay Leno the previous night was also teased.  Throughout this initial segment, and indeed the entire show,  profanity and crude humor were pervasive.

The discussion of sexual harassment continued, delving into the definitions of quid pro quo and more ambiguous workplace interactions, with increasingly vulgar language and explicit references to sexual acts. Callers shared their own experiences, including a woman denied an IT job due to her gender, another receiving unwanted hugs and massages from a boss with marital problems, and a case of alleged reverse sexual harassment.  The changing image of airline stewardesses was also analyzed. This segment also included a music game featuring 80s new wave and rap songs, frequently punctuated by sexually suggestive comments and arguments, sometimes employing racial slurs and stereotypes for comedic effect.

The show further explored Patrice O'Neal's surprisingly limited knowledge of 80s and 90s rap music, with the hosts playing various songs to test his familiarity. Patrice's frustration and dislike for the music were a recurring source of humor, with LaShawn, a caller, contributing to the discussion about the evolution of rap and rock. Audio of Susan Waldman reacting emotionally to the end of Joe Torre's Yankees tenure was played.  The conversation then moved to Jim Norton's Jay Leno appearance, followed by a lengthy and graphic discussion about a Chris Hansen "To Catch a Predator" episode focusing on child prostitution in Cambodia.  Patrice promoted his podcast and upcoming stand-up shows at the end of this segment.

A significant portion of the broadcast centered around highly explicit content.  The show discussed a news story about child sex trafficking in Cambodia, prompting a debate on how easily adults could be tricked into believing a child was alone and available for sexual activity.  The bulk of this segment involved playing and reacting to what the hosts called a "70s 8-track porno," featuring explicit sexual dialogue and sounds. The hosts criticized the poor acting and cheesy sound effects while Patrice participated in the commentary.  The conversation extensively covered fat women and fetishes, using highly offensive and demeaning language, discussing body types, sexual acts, and personal preferences. A caller shared his wife's reluctance to engage in sex due to body image issues. A Maury Povich show segment featuring an overweight woman further fueled this discussion, with the hosts using highly offensive terms.

The show concluded with a graphic audio recording of a pornographic scene, featuring highly specific and vulgar instructions from a woman to her partner.  The hosts reacted to and described the explicit audio, using offensive language.  Technical difficulties briefly interrupted playback. This was followed by additional explicit audio clips, a comedic impression of a psychiatrist's session, vulgar messages from the show's "F.U. Line," and further announcements for Patrice's stand-up show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Testing one, two, one, two.  Poe, poe, boo, boe, banana, nana.  Banana, fana, foe, foe, fee, fi, mo, mo.  Poe!  Who thought you were dead? The people you were partying with?  Dealers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff.  And they just threw them in a dumpster in London. 
[00:01:00]  Well, you know, I left them there.  I think it's pretty funny.  No one wants to get rock star.  This is where entertainment is going.  I shot my computer.  You can't shoot guns in suburbia.  And I fully expected the police to show up.  This is showing responsibility.  Opie and Anthony.  I think worse than having sex with a man would be, as you're kissing one, to feel his manhand  holding your head like the sweat of a manhand right on the face of your neck.  This is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, good morning. 
[00:02:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Starring Patrice O'Neill.  Oh.  What special guest star, Patrice O'Neill?  A Quinn Martin production.  Hello?  Hello?  Starring Opie, Anthony, and special guest star, Patrice O'Neill.  Patrice O'Neill.  Thank you for upgrading.  Well, I found out this morning that the Yankees are out. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Can't stay up and watch those effing games, man.  I had to.  As a fan, I had to just, you know, watch the game.  There was a chance.  Albeit small, there was a chance that something could have happened where they could have pulled  it off.  It wasn't a complete blowout.  I mean, they just needed a couple of runs there at the end.  If they had some people on frigging base when they hit those home runs, eh. 
[00:03:00]  But, you know, so it wasn't out of the realm of possibility of one of those miracles.  So, you know, they got me.  What was the final score?  Four, six.  Six, four.  However you want to put it.  I put the Yankees first with four.  It was after nine o'clock.  It was still the second inning.  Yeah.  I can't stay up for this. 
[00:03:30]  It's ridiculous.  You know, especially because we get up a little earlier than most.  Yeah.  Can't stay up for this.  And then you had that great Monday night football game going on.  It was a great night for sports.  Yeah, people were commenting on that, too.  I watched my games on Pal Talk.  Oh, yeah?  See, I got the Pal Talk going in the fan room.  So there's a few hundred people in there.  And then I got my media center going on the computer, like kind of on the same screen.  So you could watch the game and the Pal Talk. 
[00:04:00]  And then you get people, you know, bashing and people bashing the bashers.  And it kind of adds a – it's like you're at the stadium.  It's a great way to watch a sporting event because you had a lot of Red Sox fans in the room, right?  Oh, hell, yeah.  They wouldn't shut up.  That are also –  Three more –  Six more outs to go.  Five more outs to go.  Four more outs to go.  Like, all right, we could count the outs, jackass.  You would be doing the same thing to the Red Sox. 
[00:04:30]  I will.  So what?  Their disappointment just lasts a little longer.  You know how that's going to end, too.  We all know how that's going to end.  So we sit and wait.  The Yankees, yes, they are out.  Joe Torre's future in jeopardy.  Nah, he's so done.  He looked like – people were commenting said his face looked like we looked after sex for Sam.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We kind of had that confused, like, I think I'm fired look.  What did we do? 
[00:05:00]  What happened?  What?  The team just had to win.  We did what?  What happened?  Yeah, I know.  Torrey's so gone.  Yeah.  And George Steinbrenner, man, they just showed some video of him walking out of the stadium, I guess.  Like, they were holding him up.  Oh.  This is the most disappointing team in baseball.  In baseball.  I've got to now get rid of one of my good friends, Joe Torre.  They couldn't have just won?  What's with old double-played Jeter? 
[00:05:30]  And how much did we pay for A-Rod?  It's an offensive.  It's a stupid home run.  He had a home run yesterday.  Yeah.  There you go.  They had a couple of home runs yesterday on the Yankees.  Of course, those are the bases.  And there's just no one there.  A little solo shot.  Solo shots.  That's what they did. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  You have a guy on base.  Or maybe when you have a couple of guys on base.  And Jeter just hits into his, you know, double play.  It just...  It was a little disheartening to watch.  I was hoping.  I kept hope alive until the end there.  Yeah, let's go to Will in Boston.  Will, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Will from Boston.  Titletown, baby.  Right on.  All the way.  Right on, man.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Well, Ope's pulling for the Sox.  You know, you can only know what that means.  Complete meltdown and devastation of the Red Sox.  Just like the Phillies.  Just like the Cubbies.  Just like his Mets.  And the Bills.  And the Bills.  And the Bills, by the way.  And the Bills.  Ope's sports curse is of legend.  What happened in Monday Night Football?  Cowboys went at the buzzer there.  A little field goal action.  53-yard field goal.  53. 
[00:07:00]  Twice.  Twice.  I'm, uh...  Yeah.  I'm a...  You know, I pull for the Bills.  Of course you do.  I always pull for the Bills.  Yeah.  I fell for them.  I mean, I really felt for them.  Yeah.  You fell for the Bills?  I felt for...  Oh, felt.  Felt.  Felt.  Felt.  Felt.  Okay.  They didn't score one offensive anything.  The game was 24-25 and they didn't score one offensive touchdown.  Or I think they kicked a field goal maybe, but it was just...  Oh, it was a hell of a game.  And now you got...  It was sad.  You got the Cowboys undefeated and playing the Pats undefeated, right? 
[00:07:30]  On Sunday?  That's going to be great.  That's going to be an amazing game to watch.  That's going to be the one where Tom Brady breaks his legs.  Well, no.  Because Opie's pulling for the Pats, so that's going to be the game where Tom Brady breaks  his legs.  I didn't officially say I'm pulling for the Pats.  I just said that I like what they're doing this year.  I think you said, go Pats, go.  Maybe.  Which is pretty much an endorsement from Opie.  I'm sorry, though.  The Pats ain't that team no more.  They used to be the team that you didn't watch. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  They would lose, but they just win now.  They don't have that...  Yankees used to be that.  Yeah, yeah.  Where you didn't worry about, you know, with all the hatred that they had, they still  would beat you.  That's why people have to realize, Yankee fans especially have to just realize, that  era is over.  It's done.  It's not coming back unless things happen.  Like last night, you wish, you hope, you kind of watched the game thinking, ah, you hope  to see that old Yankee spark like that where they just come back and kick ass. 
[00:08:30]  Uh, no.  And people gotta go.  They gotta get some new people on there.  They gotta rebuild and, uh...  They got a few pitchers under the age of 40.  Yeah.  Remember, you know...  Yankees...  Goodness gracious!  Yeah.  Oh my god!  Oh my goodness gracious!  Roger Clemens is now a Yankee!  This is unbelievable how he's just gonna completely screw up, take a crap load of money, and do nothing!  Nothing I've ever seen! 
[00:09:00]  Ah, there he goes, pitching two crappy innings and pulling a hammy!  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout!  Oh, money is just flying into Roger Clemens' pocket for no apparent reason!  That's what's happening.  So as Roger Clemens came out of that game after the second inning or whatever, two or three,  whatever it was, you knew the Yankees were completely doomed.  It was like...  Done.  The whole reason they got Roger Clemens was for him to pitch in the playoffs. 
[00:09:30]  That was it.  They could give a crap what he did in the regular season, and what did he go?  Eight and ten?  Wow, that was impressive.  They applauded when he left, too.  Yeah.  I was like, wow, Yankees fans just fell off.  That's because they just hoped.  And they knew it was over for him.  It was done.  But they hoped, you know, the next guy that comes in, yeah, we're winning the game.  You a baseball fan?  Yeah.  You a baseball fan?  Yeah.  Like, I don't...  I hate baseball.  Yeah.  And it's only because I don't get...  Like, they're trashing Torrey, but I just...  I need to be explained. 
[00:10:00]  Somebody explain to me.  I watch the game, and I wonder what's happening for a manager to be involved in what they're doing.  Hey.  Alex Rodriguez goes to the plate.  Yep.  Someone throws him the ball, he either hits it, or he doesn't.  And I don't understand where the...  I understand the skill level, but I don't understand watching it and going, oh, boy, they have momentum.  I don't get momentum in baseball.  It's such a specific kind of sport. 
[00:10:30]  I'm so with you.  So with you.  I don't get how Joe Torre is just...  It's about the rotation.  Moving the lineup card around.  It's just...  It's...  Yeah.  What did he do wrong?  Yeah, what did...  Yeah, thank you.  What did Joe Torre do wrong?  He seems like a great guy.  He seems like a good leader, but he's not up there, like, hitting the ball.  No, he's not, but yeah, he's...  What did he do when he put Alex Rodriguez up third to bat, and he swings and he misses? 
[00:11:00]  What was the plan?  Like, a football game, you can blame the play.  You can blame the coach.  Yeah, you can blame the coach for calling a pass when he should have ran or something.  A lot of things can happen.  Right, right.  Bad route, bad play, no block.  There's so many things that go into a good play in football or basketball where, you know,  you just see the skill happening.  And I understand, but it's like, okay, I'm going to wait there.  I don't know.  I don't understand how you lose or win at baseball besides getting lucky. 
[00:11:30]  You think it's just all luck?  I know it's not, but as a guy who hates baseball, it feels like it's luck.  How about he's the guy that has to delegate responsibility to the other coaches who then  have to, you know, if they notice that A-Rod again isn't hitting in the postseason...  Then you take A-Rod out?  Then the guy isn't hitting...  No, but you make him work harder with the...  You say swing harder, A-Rod?  With the batting coach or, you know, instead of hanging out at night at a club or playing 
[00:12:00]  poker or whatever the hell he's doing.  But I know, I probably could name, if I was a baseball fan, I probably could name 25 fat  all-time baseball players.  Like, I know one is David Wells.  He was a pig, and he was doing like a perfect game or something, retarded.  Babe Ruth, and there was some really horrible...  Pete Rose was a mess.  David Wells looked like a middle-aged man in his rookie season.  It's just...  You could be an out-of-shape dude and...  What sport has the most luck, you think? 
[00:12:30]  Major sport?  Major sport.  What sport has the most luck?  I would have to.  I'd have to say baseball.  I would have to watching it, and I'm sitting...  I think...  Do you watch hockey at all?  I watch hockey.  I was at the Coliseum yesterday.  The Islanders lost to the Capitals, and I was thinking that very thing.  I don't think hockey's the most luck, though.  You're...  Oh, my God.  That puck is...  Someone isn't throwing the puck.  Someone isn't throwing the puck to you, though.  If you have the puck, and you're good, you're like Gretzky good.  Right.  You can move through people and shoot that thing into any corner of the goal you want. 
[00:13:00]  It's not like somebody's throwing it at you, and you got, like, the pitch, and now you  got to hit it.  But even Gretzky, you give him the puck, you know, in that situation a hundred times, he's  not scoring over 90 of those times in hockey.  No, I'm serious.  You could be great at hockey.  I think hockey's like soccer.  You could be great at things...  Like, what you do great is contingent on me being great.  If I'm a great scorer, that means there's a guy who's a great passer, I think. 
[00:13:30]  Right, right.  Well, what sport has the most lark thing?  I say baseball, only because it's the least team sport, team sport.  All I have to do when I, and I'll feel, is be concerned about what I'm doing.  I catch it, and I throw it to the dude in the middle, then he...  I'm done.  Like, there's no more thing to do.  I make a great catch.  I get it.  I throw it to you to cut him off.  And if you don't cut him off, I go, that dude sucked, because I did what I'm supposed 
[00:14:00]  to do.  But it's not contingent.  The one guy being great is not contingent on...  I think that's why baseball's individual achievements are so great, because it's really...  You're very individual out there.  It's an individual game.  You know, you're very right.  How can you blame Joe Torre, because Alex Rodriguez just is scared to death...  In October.  ...to hit in October.  I don't know what it is.  It is bizarre with him.  I don't get it.  It is just bizarre that that guy just folds, even though he had his home run last night. 
[00:14:30]  Yes, I know.  Wow.  Wow.  Whoop.  Whoopity-doo.  That's God's way of saying, look, you know, I don't know.  I looked at him, and I'm not gay, but you look at Alex Rodriguez, you go, Jesus.  If I was him, I'd be dead.  Next week, 100 million, I'll look like him with his little baby blues or whatever color  they are.  Some half Puerto Rican, half white dude.  Just special looking and blessed in talent and everything else.  He should suck in October.  Let's say hi to Scott in New York. 
[00:15:00]  Scott, what's up?  Hey, boy.  It's the case you're cool.  Hey, I'd say the luckiest sport is a NASCAR.  You figure there's one crash, the one who's in 20th position could end up number one.  Is that really a sport?  I understand it's an event.  And I think auto racing, I don't consider it a sport.  I'm sorry.  There's a lot of luck involved.  It's a bad part. 
[00:15:30]  And they're trying to sell NASCAR now as a sport.  As a sport.  And what they do now is they show a computerized.  Oh, the graphics they got now are amazing.  He's in this guy's headwind.  You know it's not a sport when they try too hard to show you why it's something special.  It stinks.  And they got little arrows on the car that follow the car with the name of the driver.  I kind of like that.  But I don't consider it a sport.  Not at all.  It's a spectacle. 
[00:16:00]  It's an event.  Someone is saying golf is pure luck.  Get out of here.  There is a skill involved in that swing.  There is a skill.  Holy Jesus.  Tiger Woods wouldn't win as much as he does if it was a lucky sport.  Yeah.  I agree with that.  Yeah.  If it was a lucky sport, then you would see it would be a little more balanced as far  as guys winning.  I saw the hockey yesterday.  I'm like, man, there's a lot of luck in this stupid puck bouncing. 
[00:16:30]  It doesn't bounce right ever.  But you can still see it happening.  I used to work at the Boston Garden.  You can see it happening.  But half the time in hockey, the team is just trying to control the puck.  And they control it for half a second.  And then the other team kind of controls it.  And then they give it up, and it just goes back and forth, a team just trying to control  and set up a play.  Nothing I hated more in hockey than watching, like, a minute straight of just team hanky-panky  in front of the other guy's net.  Back, over, through. 
[00:17:00]  There he goes, looking for the opening guy.  And you're going, take the shot!  That would be a power play.  Oh, God, the hanky-panky in front of the goal.  I'm not even talking during a power play.  I'm just talking, like, what the hell are you doing?  Shoot the goddamn thing!  And skill level-wise, though, you have to...  They've got a lot of skill.  ...a goalie.  Just imagine if you were just standing somewhere, and I just had a string bean and a slingshot.  And I was saying, all right, stop this string bean from flying past your face. 
[00:17:30]  They hit that puck, that dangerous piece of iron.  I don't even know what it's made out of.  But it's made out of, like, big tires or something.  It breaks plates during the All-Star game.  I know that, like, when they do the little...  Oh, yeah.  The little skills competitions.  It's a skill.  It's an amazing sport to be able to do.  And skate!  Yeah.  At high speeds, and then just...  Right at a wall.  It's a...  Yeah.  Like, the baseball, I don't get it. 
[00:18:00]  I just don't get it.  I'll give you a lucky sport, I think.  Soccer.  That's just like hockey, though.  Yeah, but...  Soccer is the most boring.  Soccer is boring as hell.  And there's luck involved, because when they kick on that goalie,  that looks to me like pure luck on where the hell that guy was.  The goal's too big.  The goal's too goddamn big for him to cover the whole thing.  How can it be too big if the scores are one and a half to nothing?  Because the field is as big as a goddamn airplane hangar. 
[00:18:30]  And they're all running around.  They can't even get near the goal most of the time.  It's...  There he goes.  Oh, he's...  They're using the middle of the field.  You know when...  I'm sorry, Greg.  Yeah, I was just gonna say,  you know when a sport is boring,  when you have no problem going to a commercial  during the actual gameplay.  During the gameplay, because you know the odds are...  Yeah, the odds are like,  ah, take a few commercials, nothing's gonna happen here.  Never stops.  No one scores.  The game never stops.  I had a soccer game on the other day. 
[00:19:00]  I was in a pizza place, and it was on.  That's...  Here in New York, man, that's...  Oh, I know.  ...what you do.  Pizza and soccer.  I looked, and I was like,  the goddamn, like, what would be considered...  I don't know what it's called in soccer,  but the crease.  You know, they got it lined out like that.  I go, that's like as wide as a football field.  I go, there are football games that are played  on a field that wide.  They might as well just play a football game in there  while they're playing a soccer game.  While they're playing soccer football. 
[00:19:30]  I know it's a skill to that game,  because I had...  I bought it for Xbox 360.  Oh, okay.  And I played Gavin from...  He's from, you know...  Yeah, sure, yeah.  We know Gavin.  So, you know, I was beating him.  He's a soccer hooligan.  He's just no soccer, right?  So I was just playing him like a girl would beat you  and say...  I was button pushing.  Right.  So he said, you know what, mate?  I'm going to just play...  He started playing real soccer  and setting up kicking it where you're supposed to kick it 
[00:20:00]  and doing...  And I was like, oh, man.  He started to beat me  because he just knows how to play soccer.  So watching it stinks,  but setting it up is...  That's the skill.  Yeah.  Like, these dudes...  And it's insane.  Like, hockey...  Like, the best player in the world  is that dude from Brazil.  And I watch the game,  and I go, this...  How do I know he's the best player in the world?  It stinks.  But what he does with the ball  and what he does to set people up with the ball...  Like, you could be a great player in soccer  and not score goals.  Just like hockey. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, but how would he know?  How would you know?  How would you really know, though?  Would I know Gretzky was good  if I didn't know...  Yeah.  See, this is what I'm saying about football.  He's the guy that scored the goals.  You know, but then there's somebody...  Gretzky wasn't a great goal scorer.  But then there's guys that would set...  All those Mexicans happy.  There's about 750,000 Mexicans  in that place right now.  There's flags all over there  in front of the Toyota Corollas. 
[00:21:00]  He'll kill you when you say,  this guy sucks.  This is another example.  If you have to do this when your team scores,  it's a boring sport.  This is basically waking up the crowd.  Listen to this guy go.  Imagine John Mann or Mike Tirico.  Yeah, right.  He's still going.  He's still going.  Because the sport is boring.  Because you expect him to do it again.  Right.  Yeah.  You go, oh, this might be it.  So we better enjoy it.  It's going to be the last one.  First and only.  But it's going to be the only goal  for the next 10 games.  I might as well have fun with it. 
[00:21:30]  Well, you can't have cheerleaders  because they'll drop dead by the end of the game  because they can't have to stop.  No timeouts.  Cheerleaders?  How do they work the sideline?  The sideline's a half mile long.  You can't work that sideline.  God, I hate soccer.  I've been raked on the side anyway.  Cheerleaders.  You ever been there to a soccer game?  No.  Yeah, just awful people, man.  Just an awful, awful bunch of people.  And we're just trying to get soccer going in this country.  Someone was arguing that point last night.  We got Beckham now playing in the United States  and it's still not doing much. 
[00:22:00]  And people would argue,  no, attendance is way up, is it?  Give it a couple more years.  Right back where it's supposed to be.  Can I give credit to this dude?  This is the sports dude named Colin Coward  that explained why soccer stinks in this country.  Oh, okay.  It's because, it was so genius,  it's because our best athletes don't play soccer.  Our worst athletes,  now girls are awful anyway,  but girls are just girls everywhere around the world.  That's why America competes in soccer. 
[00:22:30]  But in Germany,  they have dudes that you tell here,  oh, you're going to be a great running back.  In Germany,  they go,  you're going to be a great something forward or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  In soccer.  We have little children.  Our meekest,  most non-physical people play soccer.  And that's why we suck.  And we'll never be good.  Yeah, that's true.  Because there's 15 sports better than soccer.  Everyone else wants to be a basketball player,  a baseball player, 
[00:23:00]  a football player,  a hockey player.  A lot of kids play soccer  because they can kind of like disappear in the field  and no one knows who does well  and who's,  who's,  who's,  it's a wacky,  imagine.  You're just playing.  Soccer's one of those sports  where everyone gets out on the field  and everyone just kind of blends in.  Imagine if Kevin Garnett was a goalie.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah,  that just ain't happening.  Imagine if Danian Thomason was  one of them dudes running around with,  you know?  That's true, man.  All right,  we started a couple things so far. 
[00:23:30]  What is the luckiest sport out there?  Yeah.  And,  you know,  things that prove that your sport is boring.  Those are two things right there.  And,  Bruce O'Neill in studio today.  Of course,  somebody wants to argue the point  about NASCAR being a sport.  NASCAR is,  I know it's popping.  I love it.  Dude,  it's,  it's,  it's popular.  It's huge,  but I don't consider it a sport.  I think it's the number one spectator sport  at this point.  Don't consider it a sport.  Uh,  Joe.  Spectacle.  Joe,  what's up? 
[00:24:00]  Joe.  What's up,  though?  First of all,  I want to say I'm a big fan.  Thank you,  sir.  I'm a convert from that guy,  that,  that,  that jackass over at Sirius.  Ho,  ho,  ho,  ho,  ho,  ho.  Yeah,  I'm definitely a convert,  but,  dude,  NASCAR is a sport.  Now,  how,  I'm not saying it's easy.  I'm not saying it's not amazing to watch  and,  uh,  that it takes talent,  but I don't see it as being a sport. 
[00:24:30]  For some reason,  the word sport.  Huh?  More of a sport than golf.  You got to give it that.  More of a sport than golf?  No.  I consider golf a sport.  No.  That's a physical sport.  You're adding a danger to it.  Patrice has argued in the past that golf is an activity.  It's a,  it's a,  it's a skill.  It's a skill.  But it's not a sport.  And,  and,  and driving a car at 200 miles an hour is a,  and not being afraid.  It's a,  I think.  It's not driving your car.  It's driving a car.  It's not.  No one cares.  I mean,  jumping out of an airplane,  according to you,  is a sport. 
[00:25:00]  It's a machine.  I think,  I think to be called a sport,  you have to be in the gym on the off season.  During the off season.  Working on some kind of muscle that you need for your sport.  Like,  what are the NASCAR workers,  uh,  riders toe tendons?  What are they working on their one calf?  The gas pedal foot.  Big toe ups.  That's what they do all day of.  They're doing big toe ups.  Yeah.  I think it's more of a sport than golf personally.  I enjoy it.  All right.  Hey,  Joe,  don't take this stuff seriously.  We're just,  we're just asses.  Yeah,  I understand.  All right.  Hey, 
[00:25:30]  Patrice,  when are you coming around to Philadelphia Delaware away,  man?  To who?  Philadelphia Delaware.  I just did.  Helium?  Yeah.  You did?  Yeah,  he was just through there.  I think he's going to be in San Francisco this weekend.  Yes,  sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Punchline?  Yes,  sir.  All right.  Great club out there.  All right,  Joe,  thank you.  Hey,  thanks for listening to us.  We appreciate the converts,  man.  All right,  dude.  Yeah,  there's no question.  I'm staying.  Right on,  man.  Thanks,  Joe.  Joe in Delaware,  everyone.  We could have fun with,  I love talking sports with Patrice.  Yeah.  Yeah,  you got to be able to,  you know, 
[00:26:00]  work out in a gym during the off season.  That's pretty much it.  Because even at this point,  golfers are like bench pressing and stuff,  getting their bodies in shape.  I don't see the NASCAR drivers in the gym.  No.  In between races or during the off season.  Even though they're not fat,  redneck-y dudes,  though.  Yeah.  They're in shape dudes,  I think.  Yeah,  yeah.  I think they're in shape.  It takes a lot of endurance to be in a hot car for that long without passing out.  But I don't consider it a sport because I think the machine is doing most of the work. 
[00:26:30]  And that's why I don't consider it a sport.  It's like a robot event or something.  It's like a robo sport.  But people who love their particular sports,  they got to understand why you would not.  Like,  I'm a football basketball player.  I can argue about how you do.  You know,  it's easy to see.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right,  listen,  we got to stop there because we got to take a break.  Speaking of,  yeah,  Patrice is a big basketball fan.  And you're a big fan of women as well.  We got to get your take on the Isaiah Thomas sexual harassment thing. 
[00:27:00]  Oh,  God.  We are out of our minds.  Maybe someone will explain why this makes sense.  We'll do that next,  okay?  Here's what you need to know.  Yankees lost.  Bill's lost at the buzzer there.  Cowboys still undefeated.  Jim Norton was on Leno last night.  He did a great job.  He'll play his set a little later this morning.  And a bunch of other things going on today.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:27:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton.  Of course,  it's a 80s new wave Tuesday.  I forgot it was 80s new wave Tuesday. 
[00:28:00]  Don't you want me,  baby?  You're trying to be like other radio shows that seem to have things to do on every day of the week.  Yeah.  So we just pick stupid things just so we have them.  This is the age where black people,  where black and white people knew each other's music.  Yeah.  It wasn't racial divide.  Wow.  You know,  you're right.  I know this whole,  if there's not one of these songs,  I don't know.  This is before it took a drastic fork in the road.  All right.  We're going to challenge it today. 
[00:28:30]  Before break,  we have to find an 80s new wave song that Patrice would know.  Who does it?  Do you know the names of the bands?  Like,  who does this song?  Don't you want me?  Oh my God.  You know,  Oingo Boingo maybe or something?  Devo?  It's not Devo.  Boingo.  Minute Work?  No.  It was another stupid name.  You got to give me a break,  though.  It is wiping the music,  but you just know it.  Yeah, it is. 
[00:29:00]  It's the Human League.  And I heard that name.  Yeah.  It's just,  it all gets mixed up.  We obviously can't play with Patrice.  He doesn't know the names.  He just knows the song.  But that's like if I do a rap,  80s rap thing,  and I go,  what's the name of the band?  And you go,  I know that song.  I wouldn't expect you to know the name.  It's probably Curtis Blow.  The Furious Five.  I'll just say Curtis Blow.  I'm going to go with Furious Five.  See what I'm saying?  I'm going Fab Five Freddy.  Don't you?  It's the fact that we know,  I don't know any of these dumb songs now. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Listen,  we got a very busy show.  I want to play this.  This is the reason we do 80s New Wave Tuesday,  because we get Steve,  Roland,  and Kenny singing ridiculous New Wave songs.  Oh, a new one?  Nah, damn it.  Tim's out today,  so we'll play last week's.  Shall we play a game?  Let's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  The world was moving,  but there was it,  and she was.  Shy, shy,  hush, hush,  I do I.  You're too shy, shy,  hush, hush,  I do I. 
[00:30:00]  All I need is some tasty waves,  cool buzz,  and I'm fine.  And I run,  I run so far away,  I just run,  I run both night and day,  I couldn't get away.  Oh,  it's a,  it's a,  it's a,  it's a,  it's a,  it's a,  it's a,  there you go,  let's go to the phones.  It's Opie and Anthony,  let's say hi to,  uh,  Rich on Long Island.  Rich,  what's up,  buddy?  Yeah, 
[00:30:30]  I just wanted to say,  NASCAR was started by a bunch of moonshiners.  How can you call that a sport?  That's true.  They were running from revenuers and cops with,  with whiskey in their trunk.  And then somehow that turned into a sport.  Yep.  Yeah.  Baseball wasn't started by a bunch of drunks.  That's right.  Very good,  Rich.  And if it was,  it wasn't based on that.  Let's start our list.  So if your sport was,  uh,  was founded by moonshiners,  it can't be a sport.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  If you're running from the cops,  you can't turn that into a sport.  Yeah,  it's not really a sport.  If the actual activity of breaking the law was,  like if baseball was based on beating someone in the head.  With the bat.  With the bat.  And you go,  wow,  imagine if his head came off and we just hit it to another guy.  And he tossed it back at me.  That couldn't be a sport.  That couldn't be a sport.  If your sport is based on some kind of illegal activity.  Some kind of crime,  right.  Then yeah,  it's not officially a sport.  I like that. 
[00:31:30]  All right,  we're making our own rules for sports.  Let's say hi to Chris in Queens.  Chris,  what's up,  buddy?  Yeah,  I was just talking about NASCAR.  You could take a two hour nap in the middle of the race and not miss anything.  And I don't think it's a sport.  Oh,  as far as you watching at home.  Yeah.  Well,  that's,  that's you watching it too.  I got to say it is,  uh,  cause I used to watch NASCAR all the time way back,  uh,  in,  in like the eighties.  And,  uh,  it's exciting.  Even when you think,  you know,  cause people go,  Oh,  it's just cars going around and around. 
[00:32:00]  They're always jockeying for position and trying to pass the guy.  And,  you know,  you get to that curve where they pass where usually,  and it's pretty exciting.  They trade and paint and stuff.  It's definitely an exciting,  fun thing to,  to watch,  but it's not a sport.  My brother,  Brett is a huge NASCAR fan.  Yeah.  And when I finally sat down with him and he explained what was going on,  I was like,  Oh wow.  I could watch this.  Like when you just watch as your,  as your dumb self and you don't know anything about it and you're just  watching them go round and round. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Like what's the big deal?  But when you,  you know,  you have someone that really knows the sport explaining what's going on.  It's like,  Oh wow.  Okay.  Oh,  so he's got a pit here,  right?  Or he's aft.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  He better pit here.  But if he,  if he waits another lap,  then this can,  you know,  he just starts telling you all this.  What actually made,  made NASCAR more popular.  than ever also is the way it's covered on television.  When you just had like a camera from a distance following the cars around,  it was really bad.  Now there's a thousand cameras. 
[00:33:00]  They got all kinds of experts and graphics like Patrice was talking about in  car cameras.  Yeah.  They're all on how talk.  It's just,  yeah.  And the arbitrary,  another thing is you have to explain somebody who knows these sports has to  explain the arbitrary numbers that are involved.  Meaning why isn't baseball four innings?  Why isn't NASCAR arbitrary?  Why is it 275 laps?  Why can't it be 10 laps?  And then I can watch another race. 
[00:33:30]  That's another 10 laps with 20 other dudes.  And then at the end,  all the people who won 10 laps that day,  race again for the big prize with the last 10 laps.  So it's like seven,  10 lap things.  And then the eighth one is,  it's a,  it's a,  I think there are races like that.  They do heats,  not NASCAR,  but yeah,  CW from Motocross.  He writes,  how about all those gay equestrian sports?  Anything with horses involved is not really a sport.  Absolutely not.  Yeah.  I agree. 
[00:34:00]  That,  that is,  is transportation of the old days.  And I don't understand.  That's like transportation in the 1800s.  That can't be a sport.  And I don't understand why,  like the person that's just on top of the horse gets all the credit.  He gets the horse doing all the work.  Look at his muscles.  I guess it's the,  him beating him in the ass.  Yeah.  I guess he beat a midget on my neck,  just poking with a pencil inside of my cheek.  My neck.  Maybe I should give him credit. 
[00:34:30]  That jockey beat that horse the best out there.  He beat him the best.  He beat him the best.  He was the lightest.  Ouch.  Right at the right.  Yeah.  He vomited all his food for the past week and he was able to hit the horse.  He was able to make the horse go,  you mother effer.  The best.  Tyra Banks weighs more than a jockey.  Tyra Banks weighs more than you.  Well, now she's weighing more than the horse.  She's creeping up on the weight of the horse.  This stupid horse is getting hit and he's actually trying to run away from the crop, 
[00:35:00]  not knowing that it's a midget on your back hitting you with it.  Yeah.  He thinks if he runs faster,  he's going to run away from that whip.  But that whip is on his back.  All right.  Hey, people are calling like crazy about NASCAR.  Relax.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  It's a huge sport.  We appreciate it.  It's fun to watch.  And here's another thing, dude, that explains it's not being a sport.  If too many people have to run to defend it, if a football fan goes, if somebody goes, 
[00:35:30]  football stinks, people would just dismiss them as a loon.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  If somebody said football is not a sport, no one would just, people would go, okay, good.  But people at NASCAR or golf or swimming, they got to call in to defend, like, why would  I have to sit there, you know, with your brother and he goes, right there.  That's when, it's like if you watch football, you go, or baseball even, you go, oh, he just  hit a home run.  Everybody knows what a home run is, even if they don't know baseball. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  No one knows when to go into a pit at NASCAR.  I disagree.  We have someone on staff that doesn't know the basics of football.  Oh my God.  He knows a touchdown, though.  It's a guarantee.  Barely.  Only knows a touchdown.  Barely.  Dude, only knows a touchdown.  Safeties, I can understand you not knowing.  What did you tell us yesterday?  Was anyone keeping track?  Three downs.  He thought three downs.  Each side gets three downs.  He thought.  And a field goal is one point.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  What were you telling us yesterday, Sam?  That's embarrassing.  I don't remember what I was telling you.  I was making up answers.  Wow.  Why do you look so tired today?  I think I got allergies under my eyes.  Allergies under your eyes?  Oh yeah, look at you.  You look like you're on cancer medicine.  Do you have a gaming system with Halo?  No.  I don't.  I was going to accuse you of just playing Halo.  No, I don't.  Because I've done that, where it looks like you've been looking into an x-ray machine all  night long.  You wake up and you're, it's like you were arc welding without a helmet on, without goggles. 
[00:37:00]  I don't look well.  And your eyes just burn.  I feel okay.  You don't look well, dude.  Yeah, you okay?  I was just staring at a computer.  You look like a little kid on a frigging change bucket in a 7-Eleven.  Your hair is drier than usual, man.  It's like, you just look extra dry.  You okay?  I'm fine.  Okay, you get your blood cell count done or something?  All right, this is what he said.  I think you got too many white corpuscles.  Y'all really cracked the whip here.  Oh my God.  He should have called in.  Don't rub your eye and rub it on the microphone. 
[00:37:30]  I'm thinking you got pink eye.  Yeah, he might.  Which is very contagious.  He's sort of looking like the Emperor from Jedi.  Holy moly.  Right in the middle of when Sam Jackson almost turned him into the burned up Emperor.  He's in between the burned up Emperor and the well.  Papalteen and the Emperor.  Papalteen and the Emperor.  You're in the middle of Papalteen and the Emperor.  He's Impalteen. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, that little short time right before he turns into the Emperor.  I don't mean to interrupt you, but we were just talking about like...  A little NASCAR.  I don't know what race this was.  They just showed a kangaroo on the course.  Oh, God.  This is your video of the day.  That was the armor all shootout.  All of a sudden there was a kangaroo that got hit by a car or something.  Oof.  Am I seeing things?  Anyway, E-Rock wrote down that when you hit three downs, you turn and go the other way.  You said that.  Right. 
[00:38:30]  Okay, yeah.  You also said you like the Giants because they're blue.  Yeah, they're blue.  I remember saying that.  And he said, yeah, a field goal is one point.  Is one point.  All right.  How many yards on a football field?  Ninety yards.  You know what?  Not every football fan knows.  How many yards on a football field?  Yeah, not many people know.  I'm going to tell you what I don't...  I love football.  I tell you what I still don't get.  How wide it is?  Nope.  What?  How to judge what a field goal is. 
[00:39:00]  The judging of, okay, you're at the 40-yard line and it's not 40 yards.  You're kicking a 1,000-yard field goal at the 40.  I still don't know the number.  They pull it back.  The answer would be 57 yards.  Why?  Because you've got to go 10 because the field goal is in the back of the end zone and then  they line up about seven yards back almost every time.  Add 17 to whatever.  Maybe they could squeeze six to six and a half yards, but for the most part, it's seven yards.  Now, is that different from the 40 or from the 20? 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Would it be 37 if you're from the 20 or would it just be like 29?  Basically, just add 17 yards.  Just add 17 yards.  Wherever you are.  30-yard line, that's a 47-yard field goal.  I didn't know that, dude.  I didn't even know that.  All right.  I just go, okay, kick that field goal, boy.  Yeah, whatever.  It's like, all right, he's going for a 40-yard field goal, but this is actually 80 yards.  It's like, wait, what happened?  What happened?  What am I adding?  It's 40 yards.  I didn't understand what I was adding. 
[00:40:00]  It's basically 17 yards.  17 anymore yards.  All right.  Look at that.  You learned something today.  What he knows is what a good...  You know what a touchdown is, right?  Yeah.  See, he knows...  How much for a touchdown?  Six and then the extra point.  See, it's basics that he knows.  Even though he might not know the...  No, basic.  It's basic that he knows, because that's all he knows.  He doesn't know anything else.  Quarterback?  There you go.  Yeah, but he's not sure. 
[00:40:30]  Everyone knows because that's the hero of the game.  Who runs the ball?  Running back?  Stop trying to act.  You're a bad actor.  Who catches the ball when the quarterback throws it, usually?  I know quarterback and running back.  Just wide receiver.  You heard of wide receiver?  I've heard of a wide receiver.  You know what a wide receiver is?  No, I didn't.  You don't know what a wide receiver is.  You're a liar.  I don't know what a wide receiver is.  You're a liar, Sam.  I've heard of a wide receiver.  You're just lying, because too many football players either beat up or tried to rape you  when you was young.  I didn't get beat up when I was young. 
[00:41:00]  What are the special teams?  Maybe he's revolting.  He was born with some of that athlete blood in it.  What do the special teams do?  Special teams?  You know what special teams do?  No.  No?  Okay.  Who punts the ball?  Who punts it?  The punter.  He knows.  Why is he doing this, Dan?  Why is he doing this?  He doesn't know.  He doesn't know.  He really doesn't know.  Are you a sports fan of any kind?  Yeah, wrestling.  Yeah.  He's a wrestling fan.  Not in the college wrestling state. 
[00:41:30]  He's WWE.  There's only one wrestling league.  I'm a big fan, too.  Yeah.  But that's a real sport.  It is.  It's real to me.  It's athletic.  It's so real to me.  Damn it.  They're great actors.  You guys done for your bodies.  You know what wrestlers are like?  It's like if the stuntmen were in Godfather instead of the actors.  Yeah, okay.  If the stuntmen were in the Godfather.  Instead of Schwarzenegger, it was a stuntman playing running man. 
[00:42:00]  That's what wrestling is.  They're great actors along with they brutalize, tear their quadriceps.  They're some great actors.  Let's go to Mike in Smithtown.  You're right.  A lot of phone calls coming in today.  Mike, what's up?  A lot of Long Islanders checking in today.  What's up, Mikey?  Hey, how you doing?  Mike from Smithtown.  How you doing?  Right on, Mike.  Oh, you know it's a sport event if steroids affect the game.  I think you can give it to the horses also.  Okay, so if you can take steroids to enhance the game, then it's a sport.  It's a sport event, yeah.  That's a good point, though.  Like, you can't take steroids and be a NASCAR driver. 
[00:42:30]  It's not going to help you.  Right.  It doesn't make your foot press down harder.  Right.  It probably does make your foot press down harder, though.  But it would have to go to the ground.  Yeah.  To mean anything.  In the engine.  He has to be scraping the battery.  Through the floor.  Like Fred Flintstone.  You're going to walk, too, when you're driving.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  That's a good point, though.  Thanks, Mike.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Sam.  We proved that you're kind of dumb. 
[00:43:00]  That's great.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Wow.  Get some Visine or something.  Okay.  Other things you need to know today.  I am is coming back to radio December, I think, 3rd.  Yeah.  I may have talked to someone.  Just in time for Christmas.  I may have talked to someone yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  That's pretty much in all the papers at this point.  We were like this close to having the scoop.  This close.  That close.  We were like a week too late, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  But it's looking like around December 1st, I am is coming back to radio. 
[00:43:30]  Marion Jones returns her five Olympic medals.  And Google shares hit $600.  That IPO.  Was $85?  Was $85.  And fake sexual harassment claims are up.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's what we're supposed to talk about here.  We got distracted.  All right.  We'll do a little of that after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony with Patrice O'Neal, who's playing Helium Comedy Club this weekend  in San Francisco.  11th, 12th, 13th. 
[00:44:00]  11th?  Punchline in San Francisco.  What did I say?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You said Helium.  Oh.  I got Helium on the brain because of Philly.  Yeah, punchline.  Punchline 11th, 12th, and 13th.  That's Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of this week.  There you go.  Thank you.  I miss in the morning program.  Ho, ho, ho.  Whoa.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  I miss.  Yeah.  You can't say ho, ho, ho.  I'm on the air December, so I was getting into the Christmas deal. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, okay.  Ho, ho, ho, baby.  I miss coming back to radio.  That's what Santa Claus says.  Ho, ho, ho.  Yeah, you weren't talking about the other ho, ho, ho's.  No.  Okay, good.  So you've learned something.  You've learned something.  I'm a little tired.  I'm going to take a nap.  Ho, ho, ho.  December 1st, baby.  That's right, baby.  It's Opie and Anthony Patrice O'Neal.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:45:00]  Ooh.  Hit that just right.  Oh, yeah, man.  Yeah.  Ah, wow.  Patrice just did some great radio for us.  One, two, three.  Five people, Patrice.  For the staff.  I was cursing up a storm.  I couldn't even figure out.  I wanted to save it, but it was like too much cursing.  Patrice.  Yeah.  Learn from me.  All right.  I'm going to.  Patrice will go off on this unbelievable great rant, and I'm like, dude, just save it for 
[00:45:30]  the radio.  And I never listen.  We're saving it from now on.  And then we have to try to do like take two.  That works out, right?  Recreate the magic.  I was saying this, but it's not important.  I think because we created an environment around here where it's a hang where like, oh, yeah,  that's right.  We're actually doing this for people.  Yeah.  If we didn't just come back.  No, we're talking about natural just to sit there and.  I know.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  Don't look at each other.  No, actually, you saved some of it.  We were talking about the sexual harassment suit against Madison Square Garden and Isaiah 
[00:46:00]  Thomas.  And she was awarded $11.5 million.  $11.5 mil.  Based on what?  That's what.  Oh, what?  And I talked about this.  And when it was going down and we realized it was $11.5 million, stupid me, I'm thinking,  wow, some horrific things must have been done to this woman.  Actual rape victims don't get money like that.  No.  But Patrice, when I heard it was $11.5 million, I'm thinking that some kind of, you know,  uh-uh was going on. 
[00:46:30]  Of course.  Some kind of uh-uh.  You're right.  And maybe the, you know, the bad one.  It wasn't the bad one.  It was just, it was just set up.  It was just dumb little words.  Let me tell you something.  Harassment evolves like anything, like liquor.  You don't start off going, hey, I'm going to put my face right there.  Good morning, girl I just met.  Here's where I'm going to bite and here's where I'm going to touch.  It starts off with, hey, what's happening, baby?  How you feeling?  You know, good to meet you.  Oh, you look good today. 
[00:47:00]  Maybe a month later, you're looking good.  Guys restrained.  This is the thing that pisses me off about ladies right now.  You don't, I'm driving up the street, you know, in my giant truck.  And you know, some lady, some Puerto Rican girl cuts me off and gives me that man look  of what you're going to do, that protective.  And the only thing that protects her is my restraint.  That's why you exist, is that I don't take my truck and do a police cutoff, punch through  your window like the Terminator and drag you around the street and say to myself, here's 
[00:47:30]  my thing, I have to argue with myself, am I going to go to jail for throwing this woman  through a window or am I going to just do nothing like I'm going to do?  Right.  You understand what I'm saying?  And she knows that.  And she knows that.  And she knows the odds are in her favor that you ain't getting out of that car.  And she can't say, sir, thank you.  I didn't cut you off.  It wasn't personal.  I just did what I was going to do to anybody.  Right.  And I understand you're 6'4", 300 pounds, and I'm just a little Puerto Rican girl, and 
[00:48:00]  you could kill me.  And I appreciate you restraining your actual madness and allowing me to exist on this earth.  Instead of giving you the entitled face.  And that face of you.  And that's what happens when you go to work.  It's unfair.  You know, here's what you start doing if you own a company.  Make women come dressed as a Teletubby.  No sexuality.  You don't know it's a woman except for the fact that she's under a Teletubby costume.  Where I'm not forced to have to. 
[00:48:30]  And I say this once, dude, is like.  Oh, here's the latest one?  No.  Oh, my God.  Did you see her?  Oh, my.  Who the hell sexually harassed her?  She's the latest one now that's suing.  And could I say it?  Because I don't want you guys to get in trouble.  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead.  She is a mess.  A mess.  She looks like a mixture between Florida from Good Times and James from Good Times.  Nobody's harassing her.  And you know why?  James, I was sexually harassed today down at work. 
[00:49:00]  The boss pinched my ass.  What happened, baby?  Yeah.  I was sexually harassed, James.  She should be happy that she's harassable.  JJ, I was sexually harassed.  What happened, mama?  Well, I was just walking around the office and someone said hi.  That ain't sexual harassment.  James.  Yes, it is.  Like anyone would sexually harass Florida. 
[00:49:30]  She said it looked like I had wheelbarrow inner tubes around my neck.  She was a mess.  Like, that's what I'm saying.  She's a mess.  Be real.  Yeah.  Be real.  No one harassed you.  Wow.  So.  It has to stop.  I said it harassed me, James.  Well, she said she did it for all women.  But, and I argue the point that that's just going to make a lot of bosses out there hire  less women.  I'm not hiring.  We refuse to work with a woman on this radio show. 
[00:50:00]  And a lot of, and I know a lot of the faithful listeners have heard this, but we'll say it  again.  A lot of consultants say, you know, you should hire a woman.  It'll balance out some things.  You'll, you know, it'll, it'll protect you from certain, certain special interest groups  and this and that.  It'll be a nice balance to the radio show.  I'm like, screw that.  Hire a tough gay guy if you want that effect.  Right.  A gay guy who can fight and can defend himself against harassment.  Harassment.  You know what?  Having women and men work together in certain, it's like, and I say, it's like having a  grizzly bear work with salmon dipped in honey. 
[00:50:30]  And the salmon walks in and goes, hi, grizzly bear.  And you're like, and then every day she's coming in and then she gets comfortable with  you.  She talks to you.  She even talks to you about what's, what her problems are that day.  She talks to you about what she's going through.  Right.  She gives you a little bit of a, of a vibe that you don't know about.  It should be one day a year.  It should be sexual harassment day.  It should be a day just to blow off all that steam where you go. 
[00:51:00]  How about instead of casual Fridays, it's sexual harassment day one day because you, you work  with women that you go, God, I bet you she's a whore.  I bet you she would do something in the broom closet with me.  And you just get one day to ask, just to ask, would you?  Well, and here's something that's really, really important.  Cleavage is a turn on, not a fashion statement.  Right.  It's a sexual thing.  They get to, women can live their sexuality.  Right.  Women walk around with their cleavage show and thinking it's a fashion statement. 
[00:51:30]  No, it's still a major turn on.  I would, I would come in to the office and, and, uh, be giving a memo, uh, and he would  be staring at my breasts.  Well, can I tell you how?  Well, look at what you, we've got him hanging out.  We're, we're barely removed from being cavemen.  Yeah.  Can I, can I tell you how my, I got to tell you how my girlfriend got me to sleep.  She was, we hung around with each other a long time before we did anything. 
[00:52:00]  And she finally was getting frustrated that I wasn't doing anything.  So long story short, how she got me to sleep with her.  She went upstairs.  She invited me up.  She went to take a shower, wore a t-shirt, went in front of the TV to pick something up  and, and the t-shirt went up and I saw everything.  All of a sudden it becomes like an x-ray.  So I'm like, I'm like, okay, she wants me to, cause I saw everything.  And I'm sitting there going, this is the freedom they have to assault us like this.  Where if I bent over and all my balls was just swinging and my, and my, and the other 
[00:52:30]  thing was showing, I get that, if that was my way of getting some, we'd be killed.  I'd be arrested, but they get to freely do what they do.  And at the same time we have to restrain.  That's what I'm saying.  The, the movement is due to my letting you.  It is.  We restrain ourselves and they give us no credit for that. 
[00:53:00]  I'm being reminded, uh, reminded Patrice, uh, you were telling us how sexual harassment,  uh, gets started at the workplace.  It didn't really fully go with that.  It starts with a little start.  It doesn't go.  You don't start off by going in.  Hey, if you're a girl, I'm going to go, Oh boy, look at your blonde locks.  I like to grab them and shove your head in, in, in, in.  Right, right, right, right, right, right.  It starts off with, Hey, how are you?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, good to see you.  Yeah, you never go right to Z.  You don't go to Z.  You got to start at A.  There's a level you get to when you just go, and then here's the thing. 
[00:53:30]  Here's how it starts.  She always ups it a notch.  It's playing along.  I see it happening here with little, uh, what's her name?  Doing the little in-between breaks.  Good job, booby-dooby-dooby.  Rubbing your, rubbing shoulders.  And you want my, one of my great massages?  Oh, that feels great.  Can I get one of you?  Sure.  And you, and, and you're careful at first.  And then she goes, Oh God, that, that feels good.  That's my spotty. 
[00:54:00]  Wee.  This is, this is three months in.  You know what I mean?  Then the six month in is she, give me one of those massages.  And then it gets a little more sensual.  And she's just, oh, and you're sitting there fighting your madness to first grab her around  the top of her neck and go, you like that, huh?  And then the second is to stop it from rising.  You know what I mean?  Cause it's getting there.  So then the ninth month comes in.  Okay. 
[00:54:30]  She gives you yours.  You give hers.  She's sitting on your lap.  And that hotness in that area is just, you feel some energy.  Then one day you go, okay, all right, I guess you want to, or I'm going to try this now.  Time to make the move.  And then you realize the move.  You don't know the rules that she was only going to go this far.  I bet.  Ready?  Here it is.  I bet you, man, I bet you, those look, they look, are those real?  Excuse me?  Excuse me? 
[00:55:00]  What, what did you just say?  Did you ask me if my breasts were real?  I put, I, I.  And you're up to calling each other nicknames by now.  You know, Isaiah will probably calling that lady, hey, Big Draws.  She calls him, what's up, my little point guard from the 80s?  I bet you're swinging like one of them 80s ones, ain't it?  Big Draws, bitch.  It was probably like a term of endearment.  BDB.  I think Isaiah is more pissed off that his friends are thinking that he thought this broad was hot. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, it was actually harassable.  When he's on the golf course with his buddies, he's like probably going, doesn't this bitch  know what I get on the side?  I wouldn't touch her.  He messed up.  Do you realize that's why they have women like that around?  Those guys, those are the sexual harassers.  They're the harasses.  You gotta be able to just say it to somebody.  You gotta get that steam off.  See, that's what I'm saying, dude.  It's gonna happen.  Women gonna wonder why no one's hiring them. 
[00:56:00]  And you can't prove it's, you can't make a person hire you.  The only thing you can do is once you're hired, you pull this stuff.  But a guy can go, you're not qualified.  She said she did it for all the women that have to go to work in the morning and want  a job.  She screwed over so many women by doing this.  Less women will be hired because of this.  What guy is now gonna want to go through that crap when he has to fire a woman and she's  just gonna go into court and go, oh, this one said this. 
[00:56:30]  You got bosses all over America going, 11 and a half million for what?  For a few words?  What?  If you look at the news now, whatever this girl is, it's just a little bit of meat.  A little bit of breast meat.  Right.  Is that sexuality, man?  And it's like for me to just not say something, you're being unfair.  Oh, we should be able to have to come to work.  Yes.  That guy has a tie.  He probably has a nice chest.  I don't walk around with some of my nipple out or...  Right.  Well, Fabio shirt on.  Yeah.  We would all have to be electric shock to all of a sudden think that cleavage, like I said 
[00:57:00]  earlier, is a fashion statement and not a turn on.  Mm-hmm.  Because it's just the meat.  Men have a...  All we have to do is look at one thing and create the rest.  Create.  Right.  When I see a girl that still has...  You don't see it much anymore, but if I catch a glimpse of two things, woman, like plumber,  booty, cleavage, if I catch a girl with just that bit of the butt crack showing...  You know how to... 
[00:57:30]  She bends down to pick up a little doll that's on the street.  Just fill in all the blanks and make an image of her ass in your head.  I created it already.  Yeah.  And some women...  I don't know if white women have it, but black girls have it still sometimes.  There's a hairline from the belly button down to the thing.  Right.  To the thing.  To the thing.  All right.  And it's just...  It's just like, ooh.  Oh.  Now I just created your entire bottom.  Hey, we got a woman on the line here from Colorado, Kristen. 
[00:58:00]  Kristen, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Love you, Patrice.  Thank you.  Nice to have you back on the air.  Thank you.  This is not sexual harassment.  This is foreplay.  Let's call it what it is.  Foreplay how?  What, what Isaiah was possibly saying to her?  Oh, like...  I just don't believe in sexual harassment.  It's foreplay.  Boys and girls, men and women play that game.  Yeah, there's always that sexual tension at work.  So what protects us from you?  Like, here's the thing.  What's fair is that I think the fact that a dude who would jump out of a bush and grab 
[00:58:30]  a woman and take her humanity...  Yeah.  The fact that women can't do that, it may be that this is ultimate justice because  they can't just do that to a man.  Right.  Like, generally.  Can't come out and give me something.  And he's just crying.  Please don't make me do this to you.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  But that's what I'm saying.  You can't, like, rape us for the most part.  So I think that this is a way of kind of making it fair that false accusations can be 
[00:59:00]  put on men.  And that's the almost...  I don't...  It's not as bad.  But it's just...  If you go to jail for the rest of your life for something you didn't do or you lose  your job and you have that stigma, that is as bad to a man.  As actual rapist to a woman, I would imagine.  And I'm not comparing it.  I'm just only saying how you would feel.  I remember when this sexual harassment thing really started getting some legs.  And it was all about the fact that bosses were intimidating women through some kind 
[00:59:30]  of sexual behavior and using that to give them promotions and raises.  Come on in here.  I'll tell you what.  You want the promotion?  You're going to have to earn it.  Out of 10 jobs.  970?  And that's like the type of thing that was sexual harassment.  This little playful crap around the office or having a nude or semi-nude picture pinned  up in your cubicle that she sees when she passes by. 
[01:00:00]  That isn't sexual harassment.  That's called life on the job and deal with it.  But for crying out loud, women, get over it.  All right, Kristen.  Thank you.  Hey, later.  All right, peace.  Let's say hi to Momo.  Momo!  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you doing this morning?  Pretty good, Momo.  Hey, the reason that the whole sexual, first of all, there's two types of sexual harassment.  The first type that Ann was referring to is called the quid pro quo, this for that. 
[01:00:30]  You want a promotion?  You got to sleep with me.  That is wrong.  That's, you know, that's definitely wrong.  But the sexual harassment we're talking about with the Isaiah Thomas thing, that whole playful  banter, that has been in the workplace for years with men.  It's all part of the competitiveness that men have with each other.  And it's actually, I got an article that I can send off to Steve, if you like, in a  psychologist magazine, it talks about that the reason we do that with women is because  we're treating them as equals. 
[01:01:00]  It's a, you know, politically incorrect thing to say, but the fact of the matter is that  that's why that men do it.  It's not because we're sexual or chauvinists or we're, you know, trying to demean them.  We're just treating them like we would treat any other guy.  I don't see this.  It's the syndrome of these women teachers going to jail for sleep with young teenage boys  and, and men aren't outraged at all.  Like no guy goes, she should go to jail.  Like that hot teacher that sleeps with a 14 year old boy. 
[01:01:30]  We go, what a, that 14 year old boy must got a big rap.  He must know how to talk to women.  Or, or we all think, where was she when we were growing up?  Exactly.  We don't, that's the only thought in our head.  I don't think we're thinking is equal.  If I'm harassing a chick at the workplace, it's, it's sexual, but you want her to want  you.  That's the thing.  Nobody wants to make a woman feel uncomfortable.  You want her to go, Ooh, you know, look at, it is a kangaroo on a racetrack.  I understand what you're saying, but do you guys, do you have to hear what I'm trying 
[01:02:00]  to say?  Oh, hold on.  We're so distracted.  The video of the day is a kangaroo during a motor, a motor sport race or whatever.  They're all laughing.  Yeah.  Anything else, Momo?  I'm sorry.  No, that's it, guys.  I just wanted to put that in my, put my two cents in.  No, it's, it's an interesting point you bring to the discussion.  Thank you, Momo.  All right, guys.  Hey, you know, we are experts at this.  We, I see we have a woman standing by.  She's going to tell us that she was sexually harassed at work.  All right.  We'll be the judges.  All right. 
[01:02:30]  To all the women out there, give us a call.  877-212-ONA.  Tell us what happened at work and we'll tell you if it was, you know, truly sexual harassment  or not, we don't think the Isaiah Thomas stuff is anywhere near, especially for 11 and a  half million.  Even from her, I was like, I said, her story.  Like when I was reading that, when I was reading about, I'm like, oh man, she must have been,  you know, thrown on a pinball machine or something.  Michael Vick must have been in there.  Right.  For 11 and a half million, man.  She must have been like tied up in a dungeon somewhere. 
[01:03:00]  Michael Vick.  He tried to drown her in a bucket.  He should have.  Electrocuted her.  She looked worse than some of those dogs.  They picked her with one hand and slammed her on the bucket.  Let's go to Kelly in Jersey.  Kelly.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to see what Patrice's opinion was.  I basically tried to get a job within a specific field, and I was told flat out by this guy  that worked in the department, you'll never get hired because you're a girl. 
[01:03:30]  Now, is that sexual harassment?  All right.  What was the job and what was the field?  It was an IT job.  IT job.  Is that sexual harassment because...  What is the sexuality in that?  That's gender harassment, maybe, but that ain't sexual harassment.  Yeah, sexual discrimination.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Where's the sex?  Really?  Where's the sex?  There's no harass...  You're not being harassed.  You're being told you can't get a job because of who you are. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, where's discrimination, right?  Yeah, discrimination.  Where's the ass pinch?  Yeah, you need that...  In the scenario.  You need the folded pointer finger and then the thumb, and you got to squeeze your ass a  little.  Where's the hey, toots, wink?  Right.  Toots.  You're the reason...  Not you, because she sounds nice, but women who think this certain way is the reason why  I got to look at ugly stewardesses.  What happened to coffee to you?  Thank you.  I got to look at some hag that I go, have you been working since the 70s?  Or they just hired a mess like you with a bouffant hairdo and your married wedding ring and 
[01:04:30]  no sexuality at all?  Patrice, we did a whole break a couple of weeks ago, maybe not even that long, on stewardesses  and what they used to look like and how the airline's commercials back in the 70s and early  80s were selling their stewardesses.  Coffee, tea, or me.  And they would go like, I'm Christine, fly me. 
[01:05:00]  Fly me to Florida.  You got it, baby.  It was like, fly me.  And they'd wear little skirts and stockings.  Oh, E-Rock's got one.  Well, take a minute.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Yeah, and they'd wear little skirts that either have the big hairdo going and the big heavy  eye makeup.  And they were supposed to look sexy.  That was their job.  Now it's just, like you said, older women. 
[01:05:30]  And it's not even older sexy because I can get with a milf thing.  Yeah, sure.  But it's just sterile like everything else.  It's like, you know, you want your apple juice or you want your Bloody Mary.  And then it's like, I'm going to the bathroom and then the pilot decides to go.  And it's just some ugly woman putting, they got the thing now where the ugly stewardess  protects the pilot now.  Sit down.  You can't piss because the pilot is pissing.  And it's like, ugh.  Yeah, where are the sexy stews? 
[01:06:00]  Here's an example.  This is Fly Maggie.  We got it?  All right, here we go.  Listen to this, Patrice.  They were just selling sex.  I'm Maggie.  Fly me to New York.  You'll love my two 747s to Kennedy.  Fly me.  Fly Maggie.  Fly Maggie.  You know what fly is?  My two 747s, baby.  And fly my hairy Cessna.  Just keep it right there.  It stays on the air.  Very good. 
[01:06:30]  My two 747s.  Why does it have to be true?  That's right.  Yeah.  Why do you have to mention two?  Fly two 747s.  What happened to that?  Yeah.  Fly equals.  I want you to land your L-1011 in my landing strip.  Right.  It's right between these two mountains.  It's a dangerous approach.  But once you land, it'll feel so good.  Now it's like, hi, I'm Ethel.  We might be late.  So get there early, because the air is messing up for everybody.  Goodbye.  Take your seats, please. 
[01:07:00]  We're on an active taxiway.  Yeah.  All right.  Where's Maggie?  Where's Maggie and her 2 747s?  And we all know what fly means.  Oh, yeah.  Give me a break.  Come on and fly me.  Believe me, we know.  But why is that wrong?  It starts at the same letter.  Yeah, it's another F word.  Why is that wrong?  Because.  Why is it wrong when there's some...  See, it's integrity.  Some women should have integrity.  Some women shouldn't.  Some don't.  Know why it's wrong?  Because we allowed them to vote.  Is that where it all went bad? 
[01:07:30]  It all went bad.  I think the women's movement, the women's movement, the women's lib thing that we all laughed at  with the bra burning and stuff, actually got some momentum and people caved in to the point  where...  Not people.  Say that's the wrong word.  Who caved in?  Men.  Men.  Not people.  Because why aren't there young, sexy stewardesses now?  Because they know if they hire them, they're going to not hire an older woman that is then 
[01:08:00]  going to turn around and sue them for not hiring them.  But they should...  Look, here's the thing.  Here's the deal I make.  An old lady is the head of the plane.  Make her the matron.  She's the one that sits there on the phone and goes, hey, everybody.  The madam.  That's it.  Exactly.  Like a little plane hoe house.  Right.  Plane hoe house.  Exactly.  Can I say something?  Yes.  There's an airline that only has beautiful people working on it.  It's not even a commercial. 
[01:08:30]  Max Jet.  Max Jet.  Yeah?  I was in shock.  Max Jet to London, and maybe because it's an English crew.  See?  Europeans.  It's only beautiful...  It's like...  See?  It's like Moonraker.  It's like Moonraker.  Moonraker.  And it's all first class.  The entire plane from front to back is first class.  Oh, it's beautiful, right?  It's just amazing.  No ugly people at all.  Wow.  Unless we got the phones fired up.  We got people from all over the country.  We'll get to you guys next. 
[01:09:00]  877-212-ON-A.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  We got an 80s New Wave song that you have to guess, Patrice.  You got that?  Go ahead.  Yeah, play a little clip of that.  And then a little 80s rap for Ant and I that we have to guess.  Fair enough.  Oh, okay.  Good.  We'll do a little black-white dance.  I like when we pit the races against each other.  I like this.  Yeah, but the New Wave song we're going to say is easy.  So, go ahead.  What's the New Wave song?  This is easy?  This is really easy. 
[01:09:30]  This is difficult.  Party at the door.  This is a hard one.  No, this is very hard.  This is a hard one.  I usually know these ones.  This wasn't a hit.  This couldn't have been a hit.  This isn't a hit?  It was a hit.  Dude, that is not a hit.  Thank you very much.  Was that in Weird Science?  No, not that.  Oh, okay.  Not that particular.  Dude, that is an awful not-hit song.  That was difficult, man.  That was Oingo Boingo because you said Oingo Boingo.  Boingo, Boingo.  Anything Oingo Boingo does isn't a hit. 
[01:10:00]  Jesus.  Oh, by the way, that Fly Me.  That wasn't a hit.  That was horrible.  Hold on a sec.  He'll find another one as I do this.  That Fly Me commercial.  We like to, you know, bleep stuff from time to time and make it sound, you know, like  it should sound.  So we took that same commercial and we did this to it.  If it's going to queue up.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Here it goes.  And come on.  I'm Maggie.  F*** me to New York.  You'll love my two f***s to Kennedy.  F*** me.  F*** Maggie.  Why not?  Why not? 
[01:10:30]  Beep me, all right.  That's right.  We're just beeping the word fly there.  All right, we got another.  You want to go with the rap song or the 80s new wave?  Go to rap.  Do the rap.  No, rap.  All right.  Now, ready?  All right.  Go to 80s new wave.  Oh, that was back to school on Go Boingo.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, that was.  I knew that was in a movie.  I never heard of it.  The Rodney Dangerfield.  Yeah, no.  All right.  Let's go with another 80s new wave.  One night in fact, that makes the heart beat from the sea.  See?  You know this one.  That's the wind, despair, and it's the sea. 
[01:11:00]  One night in fact, I come in the sea.  Oh my God, you got me too, I think.  I think I know who does this.  Oh, I think you're taking all of us out.  Oh, crap.  That is.  That's the same people that sing Loof Balloons.  Isn't it just the guy's name?  Yeah, it is just the guy's name.  All right.  Save it for after the break.  Yeah.  Patrice, you're not going to get the artist? 
[01:11:30]  No.  I'm not going to get it either.  That's a hard one.  Oh, crap.  We'll tell you the answer after the break.  And you got an 80s rap song?  Yeah.  All right, let's hear that too.  Oh, we will when we come back.  Oh.  Oh.  Tease.  E-Rock's teasing now.  Are you teasing us?  So late.  This is sexual harassment.  You're teasing us.  I know y'all are going to mess with him.  Yeah.  No, we'll do it when we come back.  Sexual harassment.  Oh, that's a whole other storyline to the show.  It's E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober.  Yeah.  A whole month of making fun of him. 
[01:12:00]  No, no.  No, just.  Hey, by the way, we'll go to break with little Jimmy Norton on Jay Leno last night.  How cool was that?  Here's a little taste.  It's been about a year since I've been on the show.  I'm in a relationship now for the first time in five years.  And I like it.  It's the little weird things you have to adjust to when you're with a girlfriend.  Like, after sex, as we're laying there, I just have to keep repeating to myself, do not  hand her money.  Do not hand her money. 
[01:12:30]  Which is a nice improvement over last year when it was, ignore the Adam's apple.  Ignore the Adam's apple.  Oh.  Oh.  Broadcast program.  Saturday Night Virus.  Coming this weekend is a Saturday Night Virus doubleheader.  Starting with Big Kev's geek stuff at nine.  Followed by Weird Medicine with Dr. Steve at 1030.  It all happens this Saturday at 9 p.m. Eastern on XF202, The Virus.  Radio Shock Jock.  Yeah, 80s New Wave Tuesday. 
[01:13:00]  Patrice knows the song.  Do you know who does it?  Marianne?  Ant, did you have it?  You have it in. 
[01:13:30]  The singer?  Yeah, don't read it off the album.  No, I'm not.  I don't have it.  They have it on Instant Feedback, too.  I don't have it.  Murray Head.  I'm trying to guess.  Good old Murray Head.  Murray Head.  All right, you got us a rap song just to make it fair today?  Because we got Patrice O'Neal in studio.  See that black-white thing?  I know, I know, I know.  All right, give us some 80s rap.  You got to be fair.  Got to be fair. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, they'll never get this.  This is To Be Loved in the Black Community.  Around the outside, around the outside.  That's a good song.  Around the outside, around the outside.  Wow, Patrice doing a little scratching right there. 
[01:14:30]  Patrice knows this.  Do-si-do, yo, partner.  Keep going, wait a minute.  Wait, are you ready?  Yeah, I'm waiting.  What?  What?  He's looking.  He's looking. 
[01:15:00]  He's looking like a hole.  Three buffalo gals.  I know who did that.  Three buffalo gals.  I am the world wolf.  All right, turn this crap off.  Y'all don't even know.  It's just disgusting.  Let me.  No, it's not him.  I know the song.  I don't know the artist.  Malcolm McLaren.  All right, there you go.  All right.  You're better than us.  But I do know.  I do know.  I take time to know white stuff.  And you just take no time to know. 
[01:15:30]  Eh.  I know the song.  You knew that other song, but you didn't know the artist.  You didn't know nothing about that song.  That's, you know what, I take pride in knowing that stuff.  I got, yeah, I got the, I didn't get that one.  You know, I knew sometimes I feel like somebody's watching me.  By Rockwell.  I know the Rockwell.  He's just black and that's all.  He's barely black.  He's just black.  That's all he is.  Oh, there you go.  I thought it was Michael Jackson when I first heard this. 
[01:16:00]  Well, I think Michael Jackson sings backup for him.  Or wrote it or something.  There's some Michael Jackson connection.  Yeah.  You can just hear it.  I want to hear Michael, not Michael Jackson, Eddie Murphy.  My girl wants to party all the time.  Oh, God.  Is that bad?  Yeah.  That should be just the regular 80s new wave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Get rid of this crap.  All right.  Let's, we got to talk to a few more women here.  Furby Hancock.  We got Michelle in Florida. 
[01:16:30]  Michelle.  Hi.  Hi, Michelle.  Hi, Michelle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get sexually harassed all the time at my work.  In what way?  I work with a guy, a bunch of guys that drive those ready mix cement mixer trucks.  Cement.  Cement.  Yep.  And I had one grab my head while rubbing his private.  And he tried to shove my head down on his private.  So I had another one grab me and kiss me.  Another one reached between my legs while I'm climbing up some stuff. 
[01:17:00]  Now, you sound happy, though.  Now, why would someone do this out of nowhere?  Um, I don't know.  I keep telling them I'm married.  I'm dressed in a uniform.  I don't look sexy at all.  Wait.  She doesn't look sexy at all because we wanted to find out.  And she wears a uniform every day.  There was no vibe being put out or it didn't start out as some kind of, like, verbal thing.  Are you married?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm married.  Does your husband do all of that to you at home? 
[01:17:30]  They've even met my husband and everything.  But does your husband do that to you?  Does he harass you?  Does he do what?  You heard me.  Does he harass you?  Does he make you feel like the object that these guys make you feel like?  What now?  Oh, boy.  You know what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If we weren't being heard by a million, we would stick with it.  That's what it is.  We would try to stick this out.  Yep, yep.  She enjoys it. 
[01:18:00]  Are you enjoying this?  Like, is this something you're not getting at home, I guess, is what Patrice is getting at?  So you're not getting any, like, attention at home, so this is happening at work because it doesn't seem like you see that it's a problem.  Oh, no, I get plenty at home.  I don't need any of this mess.  So why do you put up with it?  And I respect these guys, too, and they don't care.  So quit.  I need my job.  I mean...  Take them.  You'll get $11 million if you just sue right now.  Nah, right? 
[01:18:30]  I don't have proof.  No, because that has to be a high-profile case, not some dummy that works with cement guys.  So you go in every day and get touch funny and attacked.  Like, she's being attacked.  Like, if this was the story Isaiah's girl was saying, it'd be different.  Right.  So you get attacked every day, and your husband says to you what when you leave every day?  Go get them, Tiger?  Yeah.  Do you tell your husband what went on at work?  Yeah, he says he's going to go kill them.  But he doesn't.  Yeah, why doesn't he?  And you continue going to work. 
[01:19:00]  Because I need my job.  But he doesn't go, hey, my attacked wife, quit.  And we'll figure it out.  Just put some mousetraps in your uniform.  How much do you get an hour?  How often do I work?  No, how much do you get an hour?  How much money?  Oh, I make about $1,000 a week.  Damn.  That's all right.  That's a McDonald's manager.  Go to...  All right, Michelle, we got to go.  You're obviously getting harassed, but for some reason, you're just putting up with it. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  What can I tell you?  Let's go to Jenny in Maine.  Jenny, what's up?  Grabs her head.  Hey.  I know.  No kidding.  Like, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  How do you do that?  Yeah, because of the women out there.  They're thinking we're just idiots, and we understand what, you know, sexual harassment  is when someone tells us.  Grabs our head and pushes down while I'm rubbing my privates.  Right.  That's going to be dumped, unfortunately.  But we know the difference between what happened in the Isaiah Thomas case and the story that 
[01:20:00]  lady just told where it was a little way more aggressive.  Yeah, that woman's putting up with, like, pretty much rape.  Yeah.  I'm not attractive.  I don't understand.  I wear a uniform.  Pretty much rape through clothes is what's going on with her.  She's being raped every day at work.  And she's calling us because she's not sure it's, you know, harassment.  Let's go to Jenny.  We got another one here.  Jenny.  Hey.  Before I start, I just want to say it sounds like Michelle's working with some prison  release programs.  Yeah, no kidding.  Something's going on there. 
[01:20:30]  So what do you got, Jenny?  Well, I worked for an orthopedic surgeon, really high.  He's the best one in the state.  And basically every morning, everyone in the office got really big, unwanted hugs.  And he would walk up behind us and give us really big back massages all day long.  Oh, unwanted hugs and back massages.  Yeah.  And he was like six foot six.  You really couldn't, like, squirm out of it.  But can I ask you this?  Okay.  Hey, I'm a big dude. 
[01:21:00]  If I start rubbing a woman and she does the, oh, God, wiggle, you know.  Yeah, like, uh-oh, shake you off.  Where the shoulder goes up and hits the side of the head.  But did he say to you, if I touch you, I mean, if I touch you and you make, and you're  uncomfortable, I am going to fire you.  Has he ever said to you that you're gone if he can't touch and hug you?  No.  So then how is that harassment?  And what's his intentions, you think, in the end? 
[01:21:30]  Well, he made it very clear to all the women working in the office that he was unhappy  at home.  Oh, shit.  And that he was thinking about filing for divorce.  Wow.  And I was actually the first woman to quit.  So I don't know how far it went.  Yeah, that guy is, uh, that guy is a-  He's on the prowl.  Yeah, he's basically a predator.  But did you tell him, don't touch me before you quit?  Yeah, how about that?  Yeah, I did.  I sat down in his office and I had the what for with him.  And he said, no, I'm going to continue to touch you.  I didn't give him the chance. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, no, at that point, it's just awkward for everybody and you got to get the hell out  of there.  That's sexual harassment right there.  But, but, but it's, there's a place, you know what I'm saying?  It's like, I'm not going to just say every woman is not being harassed, but there's like  a thing where you go, look, man, stop touching me.  And you just go to work.  Do you need to have your boss be your buddy?  Like, is he going to, what is he going to do besides like, you know, he might fire you  in the future.  But if you go, that makes me uncomfortable.  Can you give him a chance to be an adult and go, yeah, sorry about that. 
[01:22:30]  And then continue to work with you.  Instead of right away, just taking him to court.  I think that's the problem because when you do turn around and say, I'm sorry, you know  what?  That's unwanted.  And I don't want to hear about your problems at home.  Immediately, everything in the workplace changes because now you're presuming that because here's  the same presumption that you're doing on him that he doesn't get to do is the fact  that you may be a whore.  You might like big man orthopedic because he works with his hands.  He knows where to touch. 
[01:23:00]  So maybe you feel good.  He's giving, give him two seconds to maybe have you like it.  And then you go, nah, I'm not digging it.  And he can be mature enough to go, nah.  All right.  I'm sorry about that.  I didn't.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You didn't give him a chance.  All right, Jenny.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Imagine the guy, the guy like hurt coming up to him and saying that.  And the guy just kind of smiling and going, all right, look, you got me like those were  my intentions. 
[01:23:30]  I was hoping for something a little more, but since you're on to me and everything, I'll  leave you alone.  But let me continue around the office because there might be a whore.  Is that unfair?  That comes in.  I'll leave you alone.  You'll work.  I'll never touch you again.  And here's the thing that this is why that bothers me because we, a lot of times, you know,  the average man just wants a little piece, you know, and it keeps me from having  to come to you in this, I am so enamored with you.  Can I take you out to dinner? 
[01:24:00]  Respect move where all I want to do is put you on the table.  So it's like to keep him a raster.  I go, look, I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.  This whole speech.  And it's like, listen, I would like to take you out for some drinks and blah, blah, blah  afterwards.  And no, no, no, I'm not going to try to pull your skirt up.  And then, and then, you know, you got to be in a relationship with this mess.  All right, listen, let's go to, let's go to Mark in Bay Ridge.  Mark, what's up?  Hi.  You know, I wanted to make a point too that sometimes you get reverse harassment sort of 
[01:24:30]  where you get like a boss lady that worked her way up and now she's sort of got a thing  in for when, when guys are her underling and they work for her.  Power trip thing.  You know what I mean?  I could come in to make me sit down on the chair before I could just hand her something  and then I had to sit down again and then get up or she'd be standing over me for hours  with her breast hanging over the back of my neck or something like that and just being  a beautiful.  What are you, Kay?  Oh my God, that's what I was going to say. 
[01:25:00]  Mike, put you out your misery.  Yeah, what the?  Pull it out.  You know how many guys dream of this?  You make that nine to five go by like that.  There's no such thing as harassment, sexual harassment with a woman on a man unless it's,  you know, some slob saying have sex with me or else you won't get a promotion.  Then it's some kind of sexual harassment.  And it's still discrimination.  Yeah, yeah.  Then that's discrimination.  I apologize, but I'm just saying that it wasn't, I used the wrong wording. 
[01:25:30]  My name's Mark and I like to wear fingernail polish.  I like to wear women's dresses.  Dresses.  Are you gay, dude?  Be honest.  No.  I'm Mark from Bay Ridge and I like to wear women's dresses.  My name is William and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses.  Fingernail polish.  Mark, so why does that bother you? 
[01:26:00]  Because she's ugly?  Like if she was hot, would it be a different story?  Well, wouldn't it be different for anybody if it was a different story?  That's fair enough.  Yeah, but I'm just talking about just like, you know.  Fair enough, sir.  Sometimes it happens.  You work for a bad C-word type of woman.  That's all.  Do you still work there?  Yeah.  No.  I'm about to say, because they're going to know it's you with that voice.  Was you on the radio yesterday saying I'm ugly balls?  My name is William and I like to wear a little polish.  All right, Mark. 
[01:26:30]  A man's sexual harassment story is just hardcore.  Yeah, I don't really.  She made me.  I don't think there's a.  No, no.  Look, I quit.  I don't think there's a guy out there that could tell a sexual harassment story with a  female boss where they're going to get our sympathy.  Well, it wasn't.  Give me one.  Give me one.  It wasn't meant to be that.  Sorry for wasting your time.  No, Mark.  Wait.  This guy's going to kill himself.  Oh, my God.  Mark.  Mark.  Don't let him go.  Oh, my God.  I'm here.  Just because we disagree doesn't, you know, we just don't see it. 
[01:27:00]  I guess we'd have to be in the situation or something.  You know what this is like?  This is an I saw an alien conversation with your friends and they probed him.  The aliens probed him and everything and we just don't believe him.  Could we give him like 30 seconds to like make us feel for him a little bit?  I guess as a guy, I can't think of a I can't think of anything a woman would do to me where  I would be horrified.  No.  Sure.  Seriously.  Think about that.  What would a woman have to do to you for you to just be completely horrified? 
[01:27:30]  You know, make me strip.  It's like we'll give you we'll give you your own show on NBC if you get in front of all  the women here and you strip on top of a table and that would horrify you because just because  I'm not sexy naked and it's really degrading physicality is not degrading.  But there's ways a woman could degrade you if you're not swinging.  I don't know if they're going to cut that.  But if you're not if you're not a certain size and you're standing up there just naked 
[01:28:00]  that that could mess with you if that was some would be embarrassing.  Yeah, there was it would be embarrassing.  A woman could embarrass me if I let her.  And I guess I'm talking more about like having a female boss.  What could she possibly do that would just horrify you?  Not but we're talking us.  Probably that dude would be horrified.  She could bring you into her office with some other dude and try to make you do gay stuff.  All right, horrified.  There you go.  That that would be like horrifying. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  And then that wouldn't even horrify because you would look at the dude and go, what about  what about what about a really old woman?  Would that horrify you?  Yeah.  Like horrify you where you're just like you need to talk to someone about it.  Like out of the bathtub in The Shining?  Like that woman?  Would that horrify you though?  Or would you get through the experience and be able to, you know, go to the football game  on Sunday?  You would go.  Without a.  It would horrify if you did it.  Without much of a scar though.  I'm talking maybe about scarring you. 
[01:29:00]  Like, I mean, you would be like, oh, this is, this is god awful.  But would it actually affect you as you move on with your life?  I, I, I, yeah, I would move on.  But I mean, would it, yeah, but you would just move on with your life.  Like, ah, that was one of those things.  Like, I got touched funny as a kid.  You know what I mean?  Like, it didn't bother.  I look, I think about it.  I just laugh about it.  It's like, it's just not, it doesn't bother.  Who touched you funny?  Just got it on the car wash.  Working at the car wash.  Yeah, and I just, we just, he just, I don't, I had one of those young, you know, my, my 
[01:29:30]  thing was just sitting there for, and he just touched it.  He goes, what you thinking about?  And I go, huh?  And I just go, what happened?  Did you just, it was like, it wasn't, it didn't bother me to where.  The problem was you were 30 years old at the time.  That probably was it.  That old, gay.  That old, gay.  No, how old were you, really?  I was in the, it had to be the age, just before you could be gay, and just after you go,  oh, he was, it was, he was touched.  Yeah.  So, a 10 or 11 type of age? 
[01:30:00]  Well, I was, all right.  And he just got me.  He just, what you thinking about?  I was sitting there laying in the, laying backwards, and I was detailing a car, and leaning back,  and he would pay 10, a lot of money, which back then, which was 10 bucks a car.  And, you know, I guess it was a different strokes special episode, and he just, he just rubbed  it with the top, with the, like, with the, just be careful, just be careful.  Okay, I'm sorry.  But basically, your head's stuck under a car, like. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  And he just asked me.  And the rest of you is, like, just out in the open.  What, what you thinking about?  I go, what?  What happened?  All I did was tell everybody, and then that was it.  Like, it just, and it didn't, you know, whatever.  All right, we got Mark in Carolina.  I don't want to lose him.  Mark, what's up?  Real fast.  Mark.  Mark.  Hey, Mac.  We might have lost him.  Mac.  He was harassed by female boss. 
[01:31:00]  Loved it.  Oh, okay.  Are you on the line, sir?  All right, now you're going to have to call back, I guess.  Ah, that sucks.  He's gone.  Because I guarantee there's a million of those out there.  You know that you have a bunch of crap lying around your place that you don't want or need.

[01:32:00]  Jewelry.  You got another song for Patrice as we go to break here?  What do you got?  I know this one.  These people are too many one-hit wonders, man, to even know these people.  They're not longevity type of people.  This guy had like a couple of hits, though. 
[01:32:30]  Is this the young white boy with that deep voice?  No.  What?  That I know he's talking about.  Yeah, Rick Astley.  But it's not.  I will tell you after the break.  That's an easy one, though.  Yeah, I know the names are tough.  For the white people, that's an easy one.  I bet you it's not.  It's easy.  I'm telling you.  See, everyone's got it on instant feedback already.  No one's sticking around to find out the answer to that one. 
[01:33:00]  Mary Head, that was one that made people linger longer.  Hey, Jim Norton was on Leno last night.  Another taste of what he did for Leno last night.  Oh, you got it?  Oh, cool.  We'll do that next as well.  But first, Norton on Leno.  And we discussed sexual role play.  My girlfriend and I.  Probably not even necessary to say sexual role play.  That's the only time your role play in a relationship is in bed.  You don't do it at other times.  Hey, could you pass the ham and pretend you're a Viking?  Hey, you want to grab the Darth Vader helmet and the lightsaber? 
[01:33:30]  The toilet's clogged.  She said she wanted to dress up like a nurse.  And I'm like, all right.  But you're not one.  And she did it.  And she looked really good.  She had a little sexy nurse skirt.  And she was standing there in that little slutty white hat with the red cross on it.  We've all seen that hat.  It just makes you think whore. 
[01:34:00]  And she blew it, though.  As soon as she opened her mouth, she blew it.  Because she's like, hey, baby, I'm a nurse.  Very believable.  And then she wanted to have this sexual role play nurse dialogue.  But I guess my script got lost in the mail.  Because she's like, hey, what are you here for?  And I was supposed to have like a really sexy answer prepared.  Like, my penis broke.  But the whole thing was so ridiculous, I just said, I have herpes. 
[01:34:30]  It's hard to be sexy with medical role play.  I'm a pervert, and it's difficult.  Certain words will ruin a sexual vibe, no matter how you say them.  Number one on the list, cyst.  There is no way to recover a sexy feeling after someone has fired that word out in any context.  It's actually a good way to end an experience you're not enjoying. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Right there.  No, no, no.  To the left.  Behind my cyst.  Oh.  All right, here we go.  80s New Wave Tuesday.  What do you think, Patrice?  Who does this?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  George Michael when he was in a group.  So what?  Wham?  Wham.  No.  No.  Names are tough, man. 
[01:35:30]  Howard Jones.  Yeah, jeez.  I didn't even hear that.  What's he on crack now?  That was an easy one for most.  You got an 80s rap song for us?  All right, let's go.  I don't think I've ever heard this song in my life.  Forget it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me hear this part.  It is kind of different.  But let's get specific.  Oh, come on.  This is a classic. 
[01:36:00]  This is DJ Jazzy Jeff and a Fresh Prince.  Curtis Blow.  Here's how awful you two guys are.  This is how much you make me sick.  What about.  He said his name six times already.  This is Curtis Blow.  This is Fab Five Freddy.  Right.  What about like.  I want to go easy.  This is easy.  This is Reverend Run.  South Bronx.  The South South.  If they play this at any party anywhere where black people are.  Yeah.  It destroys the party.  Does it? 
[01:36:30]  It destroys the party.  And this guy is as big of a rapper as you can get.  Hello, Cool J.  He said his name already in the thing.  Why would he?  Please suck.  He.  You know what.  Let's stop playing.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  KRS1.  Is the soldier.  Hey, I'm me.  Oh, it's KRS1.  He said KRS1 18th.  Oh, I didn't hear him.  That made me sick.  Did he do a little something something for R.E.M. once?  Who knows?  That's your basis for understanding who he is? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  That's South Bronx.  Wasn't he the rapper that was featuring one of the R.E.M. songs?  You don't even know who Chaos Run is after you know this?  I know the name.  I couldn't name one song he does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The bridge is over?  Play the bridge is over.  All right, give me another one.  No, don't play the one he wants.  Give us another one.  This is hard.  Was that a popular rap song?  Dude, let me explain.  Turn that off, please, Eron.  It's just, it's like me going, it's like me going, like, almost Itagata DeVita, almost. 
[01:37:30]  Like, if I don't even know that, or even, we'll put it, like, Blue Suede Shoes.  Really?  Like, to black people, that's like, you go to South Bronx, to South South Bronx.  Well, it might be the greatest hook ever in the history of rap.  It's not another hook that's bigger than the South Bronx.  Ah, yeah.  And that just bothers me.  And I'm not playing anymore.  I don't know why.  Because it ain't fair. 
[01:38:00]  I got to figure out Howard Jones.  All right, give us another one.  I never watched the OMTV writing.  Of course it was.  That was a huge hit for writing.  But it wasn't a huge, and I know that one.  I bet you the Howard Jones song was more of a hit than that crap we just heard.  Not on OMTV raps, but I never watched OMTV raps.  If I had some piano, why?  And KRS-One did do a song with R.E.M.  Thank you, Chris Cox.  Why you got to always white him up?  Do I have to?  Yeah, but that's how.  We had to white him up. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, you know the Beatles did a song with Jazzy Jeff.  You know that, right?  No, I'm just telling you where I would know him from.  I didn't know who he was.  You don't know the South Bronx.  That's what I'm saying.  Knowing that is like me knowing that's as big as One Night in Bangkok or all these things.  If you would listen to rap, that's something you should know.  If you would listen to rap, that's the shit I never did.  All right, give us another popular rap song from the 80s.  Here we go.  Breaks on the car.  Breaks to make you a superstar. 
[01:39:00]  Breaks to win and breaks to lose.  Look at your faces.  Why don't you just guess the same name that you've been guessing, and now they're actually  playing a song, and you still don't know.  Why the anger?  Why the anger?  That's Fab Five Freddy.  I'm going with Curtis Blow.  That's Curtis Blow.  See, I know this stuff.  I figured I'd mix it up.  Oh, jeez.  All right, how about one that's not Curtis Blow?  See, the Curtis Blow or Fab Five Freddy.  Give us one that's not Curtis Blow or Fab Five Freddy.  I knew I'd be right eventually. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, Patrice, we stink.  It's embarrassing.  It is.  No.  I'm embarrassed.  How much you, white people, would just refuse.  Yeah.  Just refuse, man.  We would say the same thing about black people.  That's not true, because we know more about you.  We're busy working.  I know these 80s new wave songs.  Because you have no choice.  You have to live in the white world.  That's not true.  I don't have to live in white radio.  You know what happened?  This was the crap that was in the tapes when you stole our stereos. 
[01:40:00]  So that's how you know it.  All right, let's try another one.  This is just embarrassing, man.  Oh, yeah.  White line.  There you go.  Just who did it?  Okay.  I know this.  I got to get to the hook, though.  Do you know it, though?  Yeah.  The more I do.  Baby.  Yeah, let me get to the ice, ice, baby.  No.  No, I know white line.  Okay, here we go.  And sing a little bit of it if you know it.  I know. 
[01:40:30]  I know.  They'll never get who it is.  Play the message.  Forget it, fellas.  I see your face.  Just making me angry, man.  I know that.  Oh, the break.  Curtis Blow.  No, no.  What?  Oh, this is the mother effing time.  No.  That's not time.  From Purple Rain. 
[01:41:00]  Play the message there.  Wait, what was his name?  This Grandmaster?  Ah, man.  I should have known that.  See, this is good stuff, though, right here.  Don't help him, Eric.  Don't, don't.  Yeah, don't help him.  This is not helping out.  I don't need help.  Play the message there.  No, I know that song.  Grandmaster Flash.  You're not even...  But see, anytime I hear the wiggly 80s music.  Yeah.  Like, um, the remake of, uh, time, time, time, see what's become of me. 
[01:41:30]  The Bangles?  The Bangles, yeah.  The remake.  I even know it was a remake of Simon and Garfunkel.  I just, I know a little bit.  But you're going...  Hazy Shade of Winter, by the way.  I kind of know that.  Yeah.  Like, you refuse.  No, no, I don't refuse.  I know that song very well, actually.  I'll confess to being ignorant.  Yeah, but it's more than ignorant.  All right, let's do one more here.  Trying.  Oh, yeah, this is, uh...  This is old school. 
[01:42:00]  See, play some NWA.  I'll know that.  See, but that's, like, 90.  Give me some ice cube.  It's like a jungle sometimes.  It makes me wonder how I keep you going under.  Yeah, this is, uh, the message.  Like you said, play that.  Oops.  Of course.  Just...  Yeah.  I would go with, uh, Dougie Fresh.  Of course.  Oh.  Dougie Fresh.  Yeah, a little Dougie Fresh. 
[01:42:30]  That's, uh, Reverend Run.  Or, like, uh...  Kenny, you must know.  You must have arrested a couple of guys that's been playing.  I'm going to guess that...  I'm going to guess that MC is somewhere in his name.  No.  Oh.  Um...  This is bothering me.  See, if you played Funky Cold Medina...  Yeah.  I'm just pissing him off.  I am just making Patrice more angry.  Who does the message?  Grandmaster Flash. 
[01:43:00]  That was another one?  Oh, Melly Mel.  I know Melly Mel.  I got that Melly Mel.  Yeah.  Yeah, we know this one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Funky Cold Medina.  Of course you do.  Come on.  Yeah.  Funky Cold Medina.  Come on.  Play Bust a Move.  I know that.  We know Bust a Move.  Of course.  I know Young MC.  How far up into the late 90s you want to go?  How about a little MC Hammer?  Of course.  Go ahead.  Hammer up.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Great stuff.  Why are you getting mad? 
[01:43:30]  It just bothers me.  We're just having fun.  Patrice thinks it's some kind of, like...  It's some kind of a...  Like, I did this on purpose that I was so intolerant and did not want to know about this.  Not even bump into it.  But it's a refusal.  No, I like some of these songs when I hear them, but I just don't have the time to learn  about it.  I wasn't exposed to it.  You pretty much...  You had no choice but to be exposed to that 80s music, like Howard Jones and stuff.  Yeah, but you should have had no choice. 
[01:44:00]  No, I had a choice.  Yo MTV Raps was the only place I would have heard this, and I didn't watch it.  B.E.T.  B.E.T.  Or turn on black radio.  I was afraid.  Turn on a black radio station that's playing black music.  I listen to black talk radio on WLIB.  Some of you can hate black people and come and talk about it, but not to just enjoy it.  That's what I listen to.  Listen to...  Listen to this garbage.  This is just return music.  This is music...  Baby got back.  This is music they used to come back to.  You are back listening to WLIB.  The voice of the nation. 
[01:44:30]  White people are the devil and should be killed.  And that was pretty much what I listened to.  I like the...  I like big butts, and I cannot lie.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  You're just making them angry.  Why?  What happened?  We had to wait for Run DMC and Aerosmith to get together.  And then it was like, all right.  And then that's what qualified it.  Well, they basically told us it's okay to rap if you're white.  Play some dray.  No.  Yes, but they won't... 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  Play that.  But it's just...  No, we won't know.  How about this?  Oh, Freaks Come Out At Night.  Yeah, I know.  This is Mary Jane Joe.  Of course it is.  And then you go...  The hook...  And here's the thing about rap.  They tell you all the information.  Me, my name is Jim, and I go over here, and the song's name, Freaks Come Out At Night.  My name is Jim.  This is the name of the song.  I record it on this date.  The album is...  You can download it through iTunes.  And we're still sitting there like... 
[01:45:30]  I don't know.  This is Young MC.  Of course it is.  I know Freaks Come Out At Night.  I'm going to go with...  Oh, that chick band.  Yeah.  Spinderella.  Yes.  Spinderella.  She did it.  She had throat cancer when she made this one.  She's involved somehow in this song.  Yes, she is.  Yes, she is.  This is SW1.  Yes, it is.  SW1.  Sean Wayans.  Yo-yo.  Before they gave him a name. 
[01:46:00]  Before they let him be a Wayans brother.  You know...  Okay, let me ask you that.  You said SW1, right?  Yeah.  Sean Wayans.  What was that a play off of?  What did he take and make that...  KRS-1?  No.  I have no idea.  S1W, but you know where that's from.  Please say you do.  S1W.  Southside.  Jesus Christ.  You make me sick right now.  Hold on.  Why? 
[01:46:30]  He took that.  It was a play off the S1W, and you don't know what S1W is?  I'm so sorry.  It's Public Enemy Security Force.  Oh, hell.  Why would I know that?  I wouldn't want to be anywhere near them.  All right, give us another one.  One last one.  Night of the living basis.  Put that on.  Oh, you're so angry with us.  Houdini did Freaks come out at night?  Yeah, Houdini.  I would have never.  Oh, that was Houdini.  There we go.  I was going to say that.  And start it off in the beginning.  You know, you got to...  It's just something...  Y'all shouldn't be this happy not knowing. 
[01:47:00]  I love you.  Or this content.  When I know so much white stuff, and black people, we know a lot of white stuff, but we're  not...  All right, I'll go.  Let me tell you something, though.  You are about the most educated black man about white stuff that I've ever known.  I'll go back.  But we're not allowed to really...  You know what, Patrice?  All of us know white stuff.  Really?  Do you?  I'm going to go...  Shout.  Shout.  Let it all out.  We know that.  You know what?  I'll go back to my very white neighborhood, and I'll feel a little guilty today.  I can feel it coming in the night. 
[01:47:30]  Bill Collins in the air tonight.  Oh, Lord.  Uh-huh.  We know that.  We just know it.  What?  Face value?  I don't know.  Exactly.  I don't know.  All right, give me a song.  I know parents just don't understand.  Here it is.  Bam.  In your face.  Ah, this is Flavor Flav.  It's not Flavor Flav.  But it's Public Enemy.  I know Public Enemy.  Ah, Jesus.  I know Public Enemy.  That don't make me feel better, but...  I like Chuck's voice. 
[01:48:00]  I always did when I was growing up.  Do you enjoy this song?  I love his voice.  I didn't ask you that.  I don't know this song.  You don't know this song?  I know the sound, though.  It's classic.  Is it?  I really don't know this song.  But I can tell you...  Do you even know what they're talking about?  I have no idea.  Whitey sucks.  No, they're not.  They're talking about the black community.  Whitey sucks and the blacks are coming, and they're going to take over the world.  This song is Whitey sucks and the blacks are coming.  This song is Night of the Living Bases and how crack was destroying the black community. 
[01:48:30]  And, of course, why would you even care about that?  I thought it was about white Jesus.  This is a song called Anthony, Lock Your Door and Get Your AK-47.  They're coming.  I like Public Enemy, though.  The N-words are coming.  Here it is.  Crack her.  We're going to kill you and kidnap your wife.  And she's going to go, ah!  Here's some Public Enemy I know.  Yeah, the Anthrax remix.  Why are you trying to help him?  I like this.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  This is good stuff.  Chuck D.  All right, give me another one.  One more.  I like this.  Eighth wonder or a pageant.  We're doing good now.  We're doing good now.  Give him a...  This is just...  This bothers me.  We're doing good now.  It doesn't really bother me.  It does bother me.  Yeah, yeah.  It just...  It bothers me because it's just...  It doesn't even cross...  You don't have to know anything.  No, I got to know a lot of stuff, but this ain't one of them.  Right.  You don't...  Let's go...  It's just like you need to take this as a knowledge thing. 
[01:49:30]  Right.  Come on.  Let's go to Queens and say hi to LaShawn.  LaShawn.  Hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  You guys are trying really hard.  Do you know that there's...  A lot of the rap music right now have a rock beat.  Look at Red Hot Chili Pepper.  That is all rap.  Well, yeah, but that's also, you know...  Well, maybe the old Red Hot Chili Pepper.  Yeah.  They've gotten quite poppy.  Yeah.  I used to be a huge Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.  I hate them now. 
[01:50:00]  You know that a lot of the rap songs have evolved into rock music.  It sounds really good.  It's the white man stealing the black man's music again.  You know what Rock Box is, right?  Rock Box?  Yeah.  Rock Box.  It's one of the best rap songs ever made.  All right.  Let's hear that.  Thanks, LaShawn.  You're welcome.  You guys are doing better.  All right.  Thanks.  It's not even...  You don't even have like a...  All right.  What's your Rock Box?  This ain't Rock Box, but... 
[01:50:30]  Oh, what do you got?  Oh, wow.  Come on, man.  Buddy, clap your head.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  You're tricking us.  Curtis Blow again.  Well, if you're feeling old...  No.  Oh, cool Moe D.  Of course.  You gave me a look like I was right.  It's Melly Mel.  This all sounds kind of like the other song.  All right.  I'll give you a hint.  It's literally... 
[01:51:00]  They credited with being the first rap group.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Sugar Hill Gang.  Yeah.  There you go.  At least I know that.  Actually, Blondie created a rap.  Of course, she did.  Fat Five Freddy walked through the line.  That's right.  My big behind.  With his white suit and his top hat on in that video.  What the hell is he thinking?  Rap is great.  Rock Box.  It's the best rap song ever made to me personally. 
[01:51:30]  And it's the first one with a rock.  We'll end with this one.  The greatest rap song ever.  Here we go.  To me.  Okay.  Rock Box.  Let's see if I remember this.  You got to.  I have to.  Best rap song ever made. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  This is kind of cool.  Best rap song ever made.  When do they start rapping?  In a second.  Why?  Because it's worth hearing right here?  This is fantastic, dude.  You're the kind of guy that girl ignored.  I drive a caddy, you fixing a Ford.  And my middle name's Lloyd.  No clue.  All the Ford because of Willie. 
[01:52:30]  You got a funny feeling.  Floor.  Moving.  Grooving.  Is this the Beastie Boys?  Of course it is.  This is the Beastie Boys.  This is the Beastie Boys.  Made it.  Made it.  And always demonstrated.  We're rising.  And always hypnotizing.  Never stipulizing.  It is good.  It's a great song, dude.  Ice Cube.  Finally.  Rhymes I say.  Sharp as a nail.  Witty as can be and not for sale. 
[01:53:00]  Always funky fresh.  All right.  Turn this crap off.  Of course.  Turn this crap off.  Turn it off.  I know.  Come on, Eileen.  But you turn this one off.  Of course.  Just shut it right off.  I know Sledgehammer.  But cut this one off.  As a matter of fact, break it.  Break this evil demon.  Oh, is that funny, man?  All right.  Who did that?  You know who did that.  I really don't.  That's Run DMC.  Ah, that's Run DMC. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  Early Run DMC.  That was it.  I just know that, like, that, the hit.  Sucker MCs?  Never mind.  Never mind.  Wait, E-Rock is right and they said their name as it started the song?  Run, Run DMC.  It's us.  All right.  I'm going to use your philosophy.  All right.  Start another one.  I'm going to listen from the beginning to get the name of the band.  All right.  Concentrate.  Listen to the words.  Well, they say the name to start every song.  Yeah.  Why are we this stupid? 
[01:54:00]  I didn't even hear Run DMC.  Go ahead.  I'm trying to think of one to give them.  Yeah, Patrice is trying to think of one to give them.  Hold on.  I'm trying to give them just one that's not going to be.  E-Rock-tober.  Not Run DMC.  We already did Run DMC.  Damn.  I can't think of one.  All right.  I could think, but I can't think of one.  By the way, Susan Waldman, we got some crying audio of her.  Oh, my goodness gracious. 
[01:54:30]  Roger Clemens.  We'll get back to this.  He's in George Steinbrenner's box.  He's just announced that he is a Yankee.  So there won't be any question as to who's in that lineup.  Really?  Yeah.  There won't be?  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, you should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  Wow.  There's a lot of hope there, huh?  Ah.  You should see what's going on in the Yankee dugout.  They're slowly filing into the showers after a loss to Cleveland. 
[01:55:00]  Well, she was in the locker room last night.  Oh, why, Shane?  It's pretty obvious that the Joe Torre era is over.  And so it was a very emotional locker room.  Oh.  And she had this to say last night.  And then he said something that everybody in the room, we all looked at each other.  He said, this Yankee team has a great future.  It's got a lot of young kids.  There is no question about the ability of these people.  They're very impressive. 
[01:55:30]  He said, you think it's going to last forever.  And this is rough.  He's your friend.  He said, this has been the best 12 years of my life.  I wouldn't miss this for anybody.  Now, I was okay, actually, until I went into the clubhouse.  And the coaches are sitting in Torrey's office.  And they are watching this.  And the tears that you hear in my voice are coming down the faces of the coaches in that 
[01:56:00]  coaches' room.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Oh, this is so...  All right.  Well, that's what Susan Wallman had.  She got a little teary-eyed there.  Very emotional night in the clubhouse last night.  Yeah, I guess so.  How was she doing in there? 
[01:56:30]  Go, Sox, go.  You leaving us, Patrice?  No, just honestly.  All right.  I was like, Patrice is all mad.  Yeah.  He's just like, I'm out of here.  You non-rap knowing asses.  You know, we'll do a little more old school rap after the break.  What time do the computer stores open?  The software stores?  I don't know.  Nine.  Why?  I need...  Halo?  The big orange box.  What's that?  I need the orange box.  Manhunt?  Half-Life 2, second episode.  Portal.  And Team Fortress 2. 
[01:57:00]  I need it immediately.  Bring me a scrub.  Is this the Half-Life game that was supposed to...  Oh, scrub.  Is that the Half-Life game that was supposed to come out years ago?  Yeah, I was saying.  They put games out like Boston put out albums.  A bunch of pains in the asses.  But today it's released, and I want it.  Patrice will agree with me.  That was Tom Schultz's problem, not Brad Delp's.  The five or six years.  Really?  Between albums.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Brad Delp just wanted to be a rock and roll singer. 
[01:57:30]  Don't do it.  It was the genius of Boston.  Of Tom Schultz.  He was a perfectionist when he was making these albums in his basement.  He was also knowing this than you are to knowing the beef between 50 and the game.  It's the same thing.  It's over some of that vitamin water.  Exactly.  Really?  It's all the vitamin water money coming in.  No, it's not.  But that's the...  How many percent do you even know 50 got something to do with it?  50's a billionaire because of stupid water.  Because of that goddamn vitamin water. 
[01:58:00]  Everybody is drinking that stuff.  Everybody.  But he only got...  See, people think he got a big...  He owns the grape.  He owns the...  The grape.  He got what his flavor's worth to that whole deal.  His one flavor.  So his...  Whatever that deal was, I think it was like $4 billion.  $4 billion, whatever grape 50...  What is it called?  It's called...  Formula 50.  Formula 50.  Formula 50.  And whatever that was...  Whatever percentage that was worth to that deal.  So that was only worth, what?  A hundred million?  So we should feel sorry for 50? 
[01:58:30]  I think he might...  I think it was 10%.  Wow.  If I'm not crazy.  All right.  Hey, we got to take a break.  A lot of cash.  We got Jim Norton.  Some more Norton on Jay Leno's show last night.  How much time did he do?  A half hour?  It did great, man.  We're just giving it a little taste here.  No, I'm saying that...  I think he did a total of like 12 minutes or something like that.  Really?  We're just giving it a taste today.  That's what I'm saying.  It seems long.  More Norton on Leno last night as we go to break.  I have developed over the years a very jaded sense of humor.  I tend to not respond comedically to little cute, fun humor things. 
[01:59:00]  Like, you know, people who hang up little funny signs in their office when you walk in.  You know, little things in their cubicle should be executed.  Because the signs are never funny.  They're always adorable.  You know, just a little something that's okay for work.  You know, just to kind of let you know that you're dealing with a real character.  You know?  My eye doctor has a receptionist who's pushing 500 pounds.  Which really made me question his ability as an eye doctor.  And you walk in and she has a sign that says,  You can ask the man who's in charge or the woman who knows what's going on. 
[01:59:30]  Get out of her way, folks.  Sassy gal coming through.  And when she smiled, I noticed she had braces.  And it brought out a rage in me I cannot describe.  Why are you improving your eating apparatus?  Look at yourself. 
[02:00:00]  Your teeth work.  How effective did she want teeth to be?  Did she want to be like a beaver and make her own home out of wood and then just eat the shavings?  Or maybe she wanted to be like a shark and straighten her teeth so she could have a second set put in on top.  And then eat meat and cake at the same time. 
[02:00:30]  Just have her eyes roll back and her stupid fat head.  I'm actually embarrassed that I slept with her.  All right. Thank you guys very much.  Thanks a lot.  You too.  80s New Wave Tuesday.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neal, Punchline, San Francisco.  This weekend.  This weekend, yeah.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, right?  Yes, sir.  You know this one?  Neither do you. 
[02:01:00]  I know this one, actually.  The hook. I know the hook.  That's not a big, big one, though.  That's not big.  This is definitely a one-hit wonder.  They may have had a follow-up, but, you know.  I know enough to say this is huge or not huge.  Like, this might just be white people ears.  This was pretty big, though.  Wild, wild.  This song.  Escape Club.  Wild, wild west.  Not as big as a song from the St. Elsewhere, the instrumental. 
[02:01:30]  Wild west.  All right, let's go with a rap song.  That was easy.  Now, the rap song will be just as easy, right?  Yes.  Here we go.  Here we go.  For Patrice.  Old school rap.  All right, he's going to say his name.  Sis?  MC...  MC...  Rock?  Raw?  MC Raw Face.  And he said the exact group. 
[02:02:00]  He said the group.  Right there he did?  And you don't even remember the name.  He just said it.  You're kidding, right?  He make me sick.  He said the group.  All the members and their kids and everything.  He gave you all information.  It's the fat boys.  He just said the group.  Did he really?  I don't know.  Oh, oh, this is...  Oh, uh...  He said it again.  All right.  Wait, will you shut up? 
[02:02:30]  He said he's not internationally known.  It's a bass?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, uh...  D-Lite.  But D is like D-E-E.  D-Lite is L-I-T-E.  Right?  D-Lite?  Or did they sample this?  What?  Tell me out.  What did they sample this?  This is the old Vicky...  Vicky Anderson.  It's Rob Bass. 
[02:03:00]  One of James Brown's...  One of James Brown's ladies.  Rob Bass?  No.  No.  I don't know who it is.  Rob Bass...  He said his name.  Rob Bass and Easy Rock.  In the beginning,  this is the sounds of me,  Rob Bass,  and my DJ,  Easy Rock.  I thought he said MC.  I don't pay attention.  Yeah, why?  It's just...  I should pay more attention.  Like, if white people  could just do a song with it, 
[02:03:30]  you know,  a guy just goes...  And by the way,  I'm Mick Jagger.  You know what I mean?  Just give me a little info  and what is still?  All right, here's a last...  This is...  Well...  This is what...  Wait, who was that?  That's Rob Bass.  Oh, okay.  It's Rob Bass.  What?  Easy Rock.  He said it in the middle,  in the beginning of the song.  In the middle.  In case you didn't hear it,  the end.  I thought it was just his name.  Anytime I hear...  Did you hear the song, though?  Yeah.  Do you recognize that song?  I never heard that,  but when I hear Rob 
[02:04:00]  in a rap song,  I think it's a verb.  I don't think it's...  All right,  I almost knew that one.  I don't think it's...  Let's try another one.  I almost got that one.  Yeah.  He's disgusting.  All right, ready?  Have his mind.  Wait, rewind right...  It's not in there.  Just listen.  He's disgusting.  I think I'm going to say  a name or...  Just listen.  All right,  I'll try to listen.  All right,  I'm concentrating.  MC and my people call me Milk.  When I'm passing up a party,  I feel no guilt.  Gizmo's cutting.  Did he say his name in there? 
[02:04:30]  He said the whole group.  It's MC Milk and Gizmo.  Exactly.  Wait, thanks.  It's as easy as that.  All right,  so long that dude  listen for the first words.  MC Milk.  Have you never heard of this song?  Never heard of this guy.  I'd like to thank...  Start.  Ready?  Get the new...  Just the beginning  of the new 50 Cent song.  Oh.  Oh.  The big 50 Cent.  I get money.  This is how famous  that song was 
[02:05:00]  is that 50 starts  his new hit song  with that song.  Ah.  All right.  Real quick,  you got it?  All right,  here we go.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I get money.  I get money.  I get money.  I get money.  I get money.  I get money.  I get money.  I get money.  I get it.  I get money.  I get money.  I get money.  That's an 80s rap song  and 50s flipped it  and...  But that's classic.  That's what starts the song  is when you people hear 
[02:05:30]  I get money.  Right.  I get money.  I like to make  well-wool movies.  Movies.  Movies.  It's disgusting.  All right,  anyway,  and Patrice during the break  was talking about  our Don King interview.  You really...  Oh,  that's genius.  I just...  You really loved it, huh?  God, I love him.  We were thinking  that you were related to him.  He kind of reminded us of you.  Like an older version of you.  I like to appreciate it.  He's so good  at deflecting.  He just...  Don,  did you murder two people?  Let me tell you something about it. 
[02:06:00]  See,  Jesus Christ,  the sun...  You don't understand?  The sun is a million degrees  and Jesus Christ said this.  This is what Jesus Christ said  when he was talking to Cliff.  What?  Uh-huh.  And you just go,  you're right.  He does know how to deflect.  Oh,  he's beautiful.  We might have that clip.  Hold on.  But,  uh,  to get serious for a second,  how did it feel to kill a man?  Well,  you know what?  It's not a feeling  of what you're going to do  for a killer.  It's just like when you say  on Iwo Jima,  how would you tell the guys  over there  with the tan,  corregidor?  You know what I mean?  When you find people  that are fighting, 
[02:06:30]  you know,  it's the way that you  look at a life  and what she is  because it's three words.  Eros,  philia,  and agape.  That's the Greek words.  Eros is an affectionate love.  You know,  philia is like a brotherly love,  you know what I mean?  A family love,  whatever.  And agape is the love  of the human personality.  I may love you  because you're a human being,  but I may not like your ways.  Your ways may be disdain.  It may be something  that will be not appropriate,  you know what I mean?  But you still got to be respected  for being a human personality.  And so I think that 
[02:07:00]  I love all the people,  you know what I mean?  And it's what John Donne said  many years ago,  that no man's an island  in time to himself.  Every man is a member  of the continent  and a part of the main.  So therefore,  do not sin for whom  the bell tolls.  The bell tolls for thee.  You know what I mean?  So I got to believe in John.  He said,  every man's death diminishes me.  I'm involved with men.  So it felt good.  You were 13 years old.  Opie, baby!  Yeah!  Opie, go, Jim, go!  But you're right.  Yes, master. 
[02:07:30]  Like, you asked him,  how'd it feel to kill a man?  Eh, it didn't feel good.  Nah.  We just went into  some diatribe  and you just go...  I think there was  a little rope-a-dope  going on there.  Yes.  A bit of the rope-a-dope.  Don, how did it feel?  You didn't answer the question.  But I will say again  that the mountain sea  is 37,000 feet high.  What?  Yeah.  What?  It was beautiful.  I don't want to be  your third kill.  We're all right, right?  Yeah, you're all right, man.  You're all right.  Oh, that was fantastic.  Oh, ye of little faith, 
[02:08:00]  get thee behind me, Satan.  Wow.  He's quoting...  I hope he comes back.  He was a lot of fun.  God, he was the best.  He was just...  He was a lot of fun.  I love that, man.  What did he say?  Did you enjoy killing people?  I don't even know  what he said, though.  I don't even know.  I kind of have a feeling  what he was saying, but...  Yeah.  It was like, well...  In the midst of battle,  he killed a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like Iwo Jima  and Bataan  and he's talking about  World War II  and killing people.  It was the hoods.  The hood is like  the jungle  and two guys fought. 
[02:08:30]  Well, speaking of that,  Pete from Massachusetts,  comparing a ghetto murder  to Iwo Jima  is a crime.  That's not true.  No?  No, sometimes you have to,  you know, survive.  Just like Iwo Jima.  That was good.  You just went to the U.  That was good.  You have to survive.  All right.  Anything else to do  on this side of the show?  Oh, we didn't even get to play  What Did We Learn  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Very educational.  We learned a lot  about the old school rap.  No, they didn't.  Your guys...  I learned a little bit. 
[02:09:00]  These guys probably  turned the radio off  of these...  I learned to listen better  to the first  five seconds of a song.  So you know who it is.  So I know who it is.  Oh, I gotta thank you.  Ooh.  I have to thank  a member of the NYPD.  Very nice.  How fast this morning?  80 and a 50.  And...  That means you saw him coming.  I saw him coming.  I saw he was...  How fast were you really going?  I saw him.  I was probably doing 85.  Oh, okay.  So not that much faster.  He wasn't on radar. 
[02:09:30]  He was zigging and zagging  in and out of traffic.  He was getting all close to people.  He was, you know,  in and unmarked.  But I saw him  and I decided  I was just gonna  drive like I drive.  So I was doing like 80, 85,  passing cars  because they get in my way.  And then I look behind me  and there's lights.  He's right on my ass  and there's lights.  So I wait  until there's a nice safe spot.  I pull over.  I flip all the lights on in the cab.  I have everything ready for him.  And he goes,  you know, 
[02:10:00]  you were speeding.  And I go,  ah, I'm in real rush this morning.  I'm a little late,  which I wasn't.  But, you know,  I was late.  And then  you pull out the old card  and go,  yeah,  here.  With plastic or metal?  And he looks at it.  It was plastic.  PDA or FOP?  It's one of the good  PBAs.  No, PBAs  is not that good.  Yeah, that's for rookies.  Oh, PBAs are for rookies.  You were saying  PBAs are for rookies.  That's rookie crap, man. 
[02:10:30]  Is there one better than FOP?  Oh, there's a  get out of jail free card.  Yeah, there's one.  It all depends, too.  Let's just put it this way.  Ed's got, like,  placards on his car  at this point.  If you just have one  that's just, like,  one that is given out  by friends and stuff.  But if you've got one  that, like,  there's information on there  that the cop could look at  and go,  okay,  all right,  this guy is a  special friend.  Ed pretty much has  a police uniform  that he wears.  So what?  A police uniform.  When he's driving in and out.  And then he goes,  and then he just  handed it back to me  and then he says this. 
[02:11:00]  That's a good one.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Yeah, let me see that.  You need that.  I've gone the wrong way  down highways.  That's a good one.  Wow.  That one's made of metal.  The cop just handed it  back to me  and he goes,  all right.  He goes,  do what you gotta do.  Like,  whatever you're gonna do.  Yeah,  because they're not happy  they have to let you go  even though there's a connection.  Didn't have to.  That's why I'm thanking him.  He was very cordial,  very nice.  That was very nice of him.  Yeah,  thank you, sir.  All right,  I guess that's it for today,  huh? 
[02:11:30]  What happened?  What?  What?  What?  Anything else, Patrice?  Yeah,  go to patriceoneo.com sometimes  because that's my podcast  is on there.  Oh, yeah.  So have fun doing that.  And San Francisco  Punchline this weekend,  11, 12, 13th.  They do a great job  of that club.  I like the Punchline.  I like it.  I'm serious.  It's a nice club.  There's clubs I've been to  all over America  and a few stand out  and that's one of them.  They do a good job out there.  BC Improv is one of my favorite  too.  Improv's nice too, yes. 
[02:12:00]  BC Improv is one of my favorite.  I went there for the first time  when Norton was getting ready  for the HBO special.  I enjoy that club.  Yes, it's not a bad place.  Punchline's good too.  Patrice O'Neill,  always a pleasure.  Thanks for having me.  The energy you bring is,  you know,  it's great for us.  We appreciate that.  I love the discussions  that Patrice brings along with him.  Amazing.  We just go anywhere.  Yeah.  Harassed women at work  and rap that we don't know of.  It's everything.  Well, we kind of knew it.  Runs the gamut.  We kind of knew it?  I kind of knew a few. 
[02:12:30]  No?  I knew Rockwell.  I believe you.  Rockwell.  I knew the Rockwell.  Rockwell.  Enough with Rockwell.  Guys, have a great day.  All right.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Does that sound low in the background?  I don't know.  I don't have headphones on yet. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, okay.  That's all right.  Opie and Anthony live  at XM Satellite Radio.  Taking over the lounge area  of the studio today.  We haven't been in this section  of the studio  in about a week,  week and a half.  We like to mix it up.  And today we decided  to kind of come over here.  To hit the couches.  To hit the couches.  And I see Patrice O'Neill  has opted for the Lazy Boy recliner.  It's a leather recliner.  The feet are up.  Your chair is back. 
[02:13:30]  And I am fully expecting him  to doze off  before the end of this show.  And give me a little  reprieve from the abuse  I've been taking  because it would be so easy.  Patrice, how easy?  See?  Look at him.  Huh?  What?  How comfortable are you right now?  It's not working.  Huh?  It's not working.  The mic.  The mic?  I'll wait till it picks it.  The mic's working.  He's going to go to sleep  until it works.  Don't mess up these guys.  You got to get up on it, I think.  Yeah, it's not...  Oh, there you go.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, we can hear you. 
[02:14:00]  Can you hear me?  I can't hear myself.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you got to turn up your...  It's weird, it's weird.  You got wireless headphones.  Hello.  Oh, okay, okay.  This is just a state-of-the-art  broadcast facility.  It is fantastic.  How cool is this?  They really made it up  to you guys for the debacle.  Yeah.  They really did their job.  Well, we're almost  willing to forgive.  This is good.  Almost.  During the little break  before we come on the air here,  I've been watching  a little Maury.  You know how we enjoy  the Maury?  Yep.  And there is Deanna. 
[02:14:30]  She's 14.  Yeah.  She beats up her mother  and she prostitutes herself.  And Patrice was saying,  that's a girl that,  like Chris Hansen,  would bust you for.  Yep.  But you look at her here,  she is completely,  legitimately fuckable.  There's no, like...  What did you call her?  Weather beat.  Yeah, she's like all  weather-beaten,  like she's been doing  drugs and shit.  And she's been fucking 
[02:15:00]  for years.  Anyway.  I can't wait to meet  Deanna.  Here she is.  I can't wait.  Hey, Bill Buller.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  Now she calls the audience  fucking assholes  and you don't know me.  Tits in now.  Ass crack.  Look at her.  Yeah.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Now the mother's  trying to discipline her.  It's a little late there,  honey.  A little late for discipline,  honey. 
[02:15:30]  When your daughter's like,  you know...  Why do you put your hands  on your sister?  I put my hands on them  because they bust me around.  Last time I checked,  you were 14.  It don't matter.  It don't matter.  I do what I want.  How could Chris Hansen  come out  if she's a year older  than the age  that he comes out  and bust you?  Yeah.  Uh-oh,  she's talking  kind of like a sister.  I think she might be...  I think she might be 
[02:16:00]  going after the black guys.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  What do you think  about her hair  because she's hard  talking to...  What did you...  She talked to me  so I took her  by her damn hair  and I threw her in the wall.  What did she say to you?  She wanted to bite me.  I said, let's go.  When I took her  by her damn hair,  swung her around  and threw her in the wall.  Oh, boy.  I need a damn trophy.  I need a damn trophy.  I need a damn...  Like, the audience 
[02:16:30]  takes a vested interest  in these people.  Yeah.  Like, oh,  they're so angry.  Marty's just laughing.  Any real man  is just sitting there  going, mm.  I'm proud of her.  Mm.  Oh.  Aren't you...  Do you ever...  She'd give you  an angry-ass fuck.  Four more years?  You gotta wait  four more years for her?  She's gonna be spent  in four years.  I took her in two years.  Just a piece of garbage.  Yeah.  They call it  white trash.  Get a tissue.  Okay.  Get a tissue.  The mother's crying. 
[02:17:00]  The mother looks like  she's 16.  Yeah, the mother looks like  she's just graduated college.  Yeah, she's got a 14-year-old  whore at home.  Me and my girl  was watching  Chris Hansen  at MSNBC  and I asked her  how old she was  when she started fucking.  She said 13, right?  Yeah.  She fucked a 17-year-old guy,  my girl.  Prison.  And then,  he didn't go nowhere.  He just fucked her.  That was bad  before guys went to prison  for shit like that.  Yeah.  And I asked her,  it was so weird  of a sexual moment.  I asked her,  did you have hair  on your pussy at 13?  And she,  she looked up in the sky  to try to remember 
[02:17:30]  if she had hair  on her pussy at 13.  My dick got so hard  just watching her  try to remember  if her pussy  was actually getting  adult size  when it was 13.  I just was shaking  in my boots.  She went,  I don't,  she goes,  I don't,  I don't know if,  I think I had hair  on my pussy.  Like,  oh,  oh,  you cunt.  And I'm just sitting there  going,  this piece of shit,  did you see  the new one he did?  In Cambodia?  Hmm.  Dude. 
[02:18:00]  He went to Cambodia?  He went to Cambodia,  Chris Hansen,  because I guess,  I guess he's running  in line.  Oh, boy.  Running out of places  to go in the United States.  He went,  it was,  it was disturbing.  It was four,  five-year-olds  and these,  Jesus.  These,  these,  you know,  the pedophile guy,  white guy,  middle-aged.  Yeah, yeah,  the businessman  coming over.  You know,  round.  Mm-hmm.  And he goes in,  it's,  he goes in there  and he, 
[02:18:30]  and first he tries to,  he goes into regular  prostitution places  and tries to cock block,  but it was just too.  I'm looking for a hooker.  It didn't work.  Yeah.  So he had to go  to this shitty village  in like a hundred miles  outside of the main town  and it was 15-year-old pimp  selling girls,  eight,  five.  Jesus.  And old was 12.  The 12-year-old bitches  was like,  what's up,  nigga?  And,  and the five-year-olds 
[02:19:00]  though,  they go like this.  One girl,  if they were virgins,  the lady would sell them  to like 600 American,  which is a year's worth  of money.  Yeah,  I'm sure.  And,  and they had one  boom boom  and yum yum.  And boom boom  is fuck yum yum.  And the guys go in  and they ask if the girl  five years old  and it was so sad.  It was a five-year-old.  No bullshit.  Wow.  And they go,  the five-year-old goes  boom boom,  no boom boom  because she ain't fucking yet, 
[02:19:30]  but yum yum.  And then she goes,  if you no like,  give your money back.  Wow,  she's talking like smack.  Give your money,  you no like yum yum,  give money,  give your money back.  Meaning you get  a money back guarantee  on my fucking,  fucking.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  No bullshit.  It was shocking.  But,  it was so  over there.  Like,  he was trying  to interview people 
[02:20:00]  and like,  he interviewed like,  the head of  children's services  out there.  Yeah,  like they give a flying fuck.  She was in the bed sleep  like,  huh?  Yeah,  what?  Anything?  I'm surprised  they didn't put  Chris Hansen  in a bamboo cage  with rats in it.  Yeah,  that was gonna get me  all day.  She was asleep in bed  watching soap operas.  Hi,  this is Chris Hansen.  He's like,  huh?  What's with this?  Yum yum and boom boom.  Yeah,  what's the problem?  Yeah.  And, 
[02:20:30]  but the thing is  what they was,  it's so cultural.  It's,  they sell kids,  dude.  Like,  they try to save them.  They go in  and they try to save them.  Yeah.  And they,  and the kids are crying  like,  I don't,  what are you doing?  Right?  They got a home  for like,  14 year olds.  Those are the old school ones.  And they take them  and try to teach them shit.  They run away  and go back to  selling pussy.  Holy shit.  Cause you can,  cause the public police, 
[02:21:00]  you give $150 to them  and they fucking,  the,  the guy,  that,  the police get paid that  every six months.  Yeah.  $150.  You give them six months pay  in one night,  they're going to leave you  the fuck alone.  And you go out  to this shitty village  and it's these awful,  but the,  it's so fucking creepy.  But the thing about it  is this,  this is my problem  I have with these,  these programs.  You don't feel like,  they're really helping.  They're just trying to go  and they, 
[02:21:30]  they fuck with this doctor  who was there,  this doctor who was  going over to these places  and fucking little kids  and shit.  And,  and they fucked with him  a little bit,  but he was so smooth.  He couldn't,  he just got out of it,  but they really didn't  give a fuck  cause the kids are just like,  yeah,  yum,  yum,  boom,  boom,  boom,  yum,  yum,  uh-huh.  Sit with their legs crossed,  smoking cigarettes.  It was,  holy shit.  You got to see it.  This was on TV already?  And they ain't gonna save  anybody.  They're not gonna do anything  in that culture,  in that country.  They arrested a couple of people 
[02:22:00]  and da-da-da,  but they went out again  the next week  and Chris Hansen  didn't go,  by the way.  No.  He wasn't there  doing his thing.  Oh,  okay.  cause those,  it was one of those pimps,  those,  those,  my,  my,  my,  my motherfuckers,  right?  Yeah,  maw,  maw.  And he said,  he goes,  um,  to this,  to one of the guys  cause they,  they go over these  human rights places  try to help the kids  and they go with a,  uh,  like a camera hat  and a bag  with a camera hat,  a hat that moves  left and right,  you know?  The logo's moving 
[02:22:30]  from left to right  across the forehead.  The Nike logo,  the swooshes,  the swooshes.  You're hearing a buzz  whenever it moves.  And one of those pimps,  the guy had to get away  with his life  cause one of the pimps goes,  I don't,  is that a camera?  He goes,  fuck one of these girls,  man.  Or if you don't fuck  one of these girls  I'm gonna kill you.  Holy shit.  And the guy talked  his way out of it  but he's like,  if you don't fuck  one of the little girls  right now,  I'm gonna fucking kill you. 
[02:23:00]  That's how dangerous  this is.  Holy bloody shit  going on.  It was fucked up,  man.  But he,  the investigation  went from,  he tried to just  cock block first.  Can we call Chris Hansen  by the way?  We have a good  relationship with him.  We could maybe  get him on the air today.  It was like a  cock block first  cause he tried to go  into regular  buying pussy shit.  And he goes,  by the way,  buying pussy  is illegal  in this country.  Just to throw it  at you,  but still no one 
[02:23:30]  was feeling  who gives a fuck  cause people  travel all over  the world  to fuck  third world  bitches.  It just is  what it is.  I'm part  of the crime  too.  But yours  are of age.  Yeah,  we fucked.  You might want  to explain that.  Oh,  sorry.  After the half hour.  Of the kid thing  but he  he tried to  he went into  regular  prostitution places  of legal women  of guys just  and he was trying  to make that  seedy  like guys  are going here  taking women 
[02:24:00]  and buying pussy.  That whole thing  and no one was  giving a fuck.  You could feel it  like Chris  you're cock block.  It's legit there.  They don't give a fuck.  The women don't care.  To this fucking village  miles away  it was  it was  horrible.  Wow.  It was fucking  it was so  you get sad  you do get  it affect  it really  if you're not  a fucking pedophile  you can't help  but be sad  of that kind.  They didn't profile  that one  or promo that one  on the channel. 
[02:24:30]  No kidding.  I didn't see  a promo for that one  come up.  That shit was crazy  and they followed  this doctor  and what it was  is they did profile him  because he looked like  Mr. Pedophile  just a creepy  little white dude  and they took a chance  at first they said  he was in the regular joints  then they go  they went to the village  and had the secret camera  because he was being  interviewed on team  he's like  I love coming to Cambodia  Guam  it's great  and you know  I love the women  and they just looked at him  and this guy's a bunk of shit 
[02:25:00]  we feel it  and then  next thing you know  he was in that  that little  pedophile village  and he was showing the camera  Yum yum  with the red eye  make his eyes red  and they go  and this guy  tells us  how to go fuck  little kids  and then  we recognized him  it was Dr. Cotsucker  yes  Dr. Cotsucker  and he was an asshole  going  yeah  I fucked the 14  or 15 year olds  I don't get into  the little teeny ones 
[02:25:30]  it was  fuck  it made you  it made you skin crawl  then they would just  go around the village  asking any  arbitrary white guy  why are you here  guys are like  I just love  dirty villages  outside of Cambodia  yeah  what excuse  do you have  I just enjoy  Cambodia  so what are you doing here  I like an authentic  Cambodian air  yeah  what  yeah you can't get  the real air  until you come way out here  with fucking  child fuck village  it was

[02:26:30]  were you ready to fuck  when you fucked at that age  and she's had to think about it  cause you get  you're horny  how old are you  when you're horny  it's hard to tell  I'm 37  I can't fuck a 13 year old  but it's like  some fucking 17 year old  can't fuck a 13 year old  I don't  it should it not be that  yeah  you understand what I'm saying  oh yeah yeah  you know  when I was in my teens  I was guilty of that myself  so what the fuck  like I don't know  I don't know  but these girls  this is what  when he was on the show 
[02:27:00]  that time  it was so interesting  I was like  why don't you  have a person online  pretending to be  the age of these  little Cambodian kids  that  these guys are fucking with  then everybody  will be outraged  yeah yeah  there's no  there's no recovering  from that  saying well  she looked  a certain age  or  you know  those are obviously  that little five year old  going yum yum  boom boom  like a 
[02:27:30]  like a fuck  like a  like a full metal jacket  yum yum  got that yum yum nigga  what  and it wasn't like  oh yeah  that's just  like  ball playing  and I suck a dick  that's just TV executives  getting involved  we'll do this show  but it's gotta be  you know  we can't go with the kids  we have to get it around  13 14  no  or we can't do this show  we can't have it on our network  nope  nope  why do you think  they do it then  because  he said it  what did he say  I don't remember  I asked that motherfucker 
[02:28:00]  if  why not  there's some states  16  yeah  is  is the legal  it's not  it's  it's 17  why not have 16  on your show  because  no one would give a fuck  right  it's not about law breaking  it's about  what age do we have  that's  fucked up enough  yeah  and  but not  that enough guys  would get busted 
[02:28:30]  doing this  if he did a sting  where it was like  8 year olds  and 7 year olds  he would have to go  deeper  into the bowels of hell  which  he doesn't have to do  and there aren't as many people  there wouldn't be  a car pulling up  every minute  every minute  for a fucking 5 year old  for that  cause that  cause that's like  a hell of a 5 year old  really fucking sick  yeah  you know what I mean  I brought some  I brought some Zima  did ya  13 is a fucked up age 
[02:29:00]  to fuck with a motherfucker  when I drive  if I'm ever out my house  during the 3 o'clock school  letting out high school  I have to wear  one of those things  they put on horses  the blinders  or they put on dogs  so they don't lick  themselves after surgery  so you don't look at  a fucking 15 year old girl  you  and you know  you try to be a decent  god damn human being  but if they're sexual  cause there's  there's two different  words  there's pedophile  and there's pederans  and pederans 
[02:29:30]  is the motherfuckers  that  it's the 5 year olds  but  when they make a motherfucker  who looks at a 13 year old  with some titties  and questionably  a hairy pussy  it's  that's why they have  that age  cause it's young enough  to go  you motherfucker  but old enough  to go  oh god  please help me  a 13 year old  just said  she's gonna suck my dick  and she's done it before  please god  don't let  please let me  that's why you hear  on that shit  every time a guy  goes in there  he goes  he goes  oh god 
[02:30:00]  I knew I fucked up  but catch a real pedophile  he'll be like  this is bullshit  he knows all the pedophile words  but it'd be a regular  motherfucker  some regular asshole  it's my right as a human  yes  it's just some asshole  I'm giving them love  pedophiles are  some asshole  show me in the bible  where this is wrong  and where this is  exactly  exactly  I would love to see that  that's why they play  that 13-14 game 
[02:30:30]  with a motherfucker  because you go  because here's the question  how old  if it wasn't such a thing  as law  and fucking limits  and age  what age would you  stop yourself  who wouldn't you fuck  if there was no law  I've seen girls  that obviously  weren't of age  that look  completely fuckable  completely fuckable  I don't know  I don't know how old  they are  what are you 13-14  I think that's probably  the age where 
[02:31:00]  some girls  are really mature looking  and then others  look like fucking  you know  like kids  8 years old  so basically if they look  like a sexual  something  yeah  you see some girls  with big titties  and you know  they got hair  it's the fucking  hairy arms  hair is the fucking  it's the call  that's the call  hair  you know  it's just a tough thing  but that's why  those ages 
[02:31:30]  it's those weird  fucking  ages  and it also  you know what else  it does  it gets the parents  that are watching  that show  like anyone  if you're a parent  not a parent  fucking  no matter what you do  if you look at somebody  in a sting operation  with a 5-6 year old  everyone is gonna go  that guy's a scumbag  everybody dude  now if you look at  with a 14 year old  especially some of the  decoys they have  that come out  and you know  they sound young  and everything  but she's got a body  on her  you know 
[02:32:00]  and they walk in  some people are gonna  be going  you know  it's not too bad  and others  like parents  of girls that age  are gonna be going  this is outrageous  cause all they're thinking  is their little girl  you know  on the computer  when I do comedy shows  I  and if I get into  this whole thing  cause I'll get into it  you know what I mean  cause it's one of those  things that fuck with you  you know  I got in trouble  for that shit  when I was 17  and it's just like  you go  where's the thing at  and I'll ask women 
[02:32:30]  how many in here  was a virgin  till you was 18  it might be  one funky bitch  who's about 60  cause that's when  they did it  you know  she got finger popped  on top of  a jukebox  in Al's place  in Al's Diner  and she'll be a virgin  yeah  but any woman  who's in her 20s  or 30  they don't raise  their fucking hand  they were fucking  before they supposed  to have been fucking  so what do you  you know 
[02:33:00]  and I understand  if you're talking  40 year old man  13 year old girl  but we're talking  18 year old  14 year old  yeah  we're talking  17  13  20  16  yep  you know what I mean  junior in high school  going into senior  16  and a  and a fucking  Duke lacrosse dude  at  22  yeah  I don't  is it  how fucked up  is that  it's illegal  that's all 
[02:33:30]  I know  it's illegal  but I'm saying  is it that  fucked up  are there  16 year old  girls going  oh I don't  no I would  never fuck  a 22 year old  he's too old  like they look  they want to go  pretend to be old  and fuck a college guy  yeah some of them  sure  fuck yeah  but Chris Hanson  that shit  that Cambodia shit  was disturbing  that was the shit  they probably  will never show again  cause it  it generally  hurts your heart  I didn't see that one  yeah we gotta get him  on the show  to talk about that  alright Patrice 
[02:34:00]  Jesus  fuck  what do you think  of the new studio  boom boom  it's beautiful  yum yum  yum yum  and boom boom  it was a motherfucker  so no  no boom boom  boom boom  means no  600 700  800 dollars  for boom boom  if she's like  teeny  yeah but  but the yum yum  yum yum  they all yum yum  in it  is that's  that would be  a blow shop  yum yum  it is happening  Jesus  wow  and if you  if I don't yum yum 
[02:34:30]  you're right  and this is all  you don't have to  this is all on that show  money back guarantee  this is news  this is just  I'm just repeating the news  this ain't  I didn't go to Cambodia  yeah  it's just that  you go in there  and they just  uncovered  that shit  and those little girls  are not even  sure they're abused  they don't even know  what the fuck  is going on  Alex from New York City  makes a great point though  cause we've all seen  you know  to catch a predator  he writes  how are you gonna get  a guy to believe  a five year old  is home alone  waiting for you  home alone 
[02:35:00]  that's true  cause they're always  home alone  you know  come on in  you can understand  a 13, 14 year old  home alone  but a five year old  and the kid writes  and the five year old  writes  I'm home alone  learning my ABCs  and she writes  20,000 words a minute  you're typing  like a champ  fingers on the home 
[02:35:30]  buttons  how'd you learn  how to type  so fast at five  Mavis Beacon  oh well  I  webkins  of course  I guess you got  a point there  yeah  alright  we got a couple  things where you  want to do today  we could either do  the top ten  country songs  we like to do that  when Patrice is here  yes  and we also have  another installment  of 8-Track Porno  ooh  haven't done that  in a day or two  we haven't done that  no we haven't done that  in a while

[02:50:00]  it's not  overpowering  but you  can hear  very faintly  some of the  original audio  that we first  played  I heard it  more than a  little faintly  it was just  that one  part  the nosy  neighbor  coming back  in  what are you  looking at  Patrice is  distracted  he's looking  at some  slob on  my overweight  mom dresses  too sexy  on Maury  oh god  damn  that fucking  woman is the  exact shape of  a beach ball  she's fucking  round  so change the

[02:51:00]  big fat  bitch  in a  fuzzy  bikini  top  that was  shaped like  a beach  ball  and now  we're looking  at Yankees  and now I'm  looking at the  Yankees  fucking  losing last  night  yeah  alright  there it is  there you go  yeah  oh  so do you  have  what you  would like  to see  oh I would  like to see  this young  lady  in clothes  in clothes  she's not  conservative

[02:52:00]  not boob  that's  like fat  it's like  I think it's  just something  that's so  disturbing  I don't know  she's just  so wrong  why  that was her  armpit  she probably  would give you  the best  dick sucking  ever  they're just  blurring out  her armpit  for some reason  I think it's  titty meat  they're blurring out  not there  look  wow I am  boggled  maybe it's  all  fading into

[02:53:00]  this  gets the  same amount  of  people hit  on her  the same  amount  of  times  they hit  on a  beautiful  woman  really  and maybe  more  and the  reason why  they get  hit  better on  is because  guys think  they can  actually  fuck  them  that day  oh they're  completely  attainable  so beautiful  women never  get like  those kind  of hits  where you go  hey baby  I'm gonna  fuck you  right now  they always  get  I'm gonna  buy you  flowers  but this  bitch gets  I got  I got a  big dick  where you  suck it  and she'll  go

[02:56:00]  let's  go back  to the  8-track  right  where were  we  oh  Jesus  she  begins  she  her  bra  slipped  off  what  the  fuck  was she  wearing  that's  the worst  line  she  was  horrendous  horrendous  that  is  a  fucking  mess  look  I'm  in  the  regular  fat  girl  beautiful 
[02:56:30]  fat  women  on  the  radio  we  explain  why  that  ridiculous  laugh  she  was  built  she  was  built  exactly  like  those  dolls  that  fit  into  each  other  like  the  Russian  things  that  fit  one  until  you  get  to  a  bigger  one  yeah  yeah  and  she  was  completely  shaped  like  a  round  like  a  balled  up  box  like  a  boxing  glove  with  a  wig  on  she  was  a  fuck  you  know  these  girls  see  she's 
[02:57:00]  the  kind  of  fat  remember  miss  miss  from  porkies  oh yeah  miss  ball  breaker  ball  breaker  that  weird  not  shape  right  round  skinny  legs  then fat  thighs  then a  skinny  stomach  but then  fat  arms  big  fat  up  that  was  a  weird  shaped  fat  woman  and I  was laughing  at how  fucked up  I am  trying to  find the 
[02:57:30]  redeeming  quality  of  how you  would  fuck her  I was laughing  at the fact  is that I  wouldn't have  fucked her  which makes  her bad  because I  fuck most  fat women  I like  fucking  with fat  women  but the  criteria for  a fat  girl she  gotta be  pretty  she has  to be  a beautiful  woman  and she  has to  have about  a D  or double  D cup  big fat  tits  and a  pretty  face  kissable  and you're 
[02:58:00]  just rubbing  those fat  tits  but the  lady you  were jonesing  on there  didn't have  any of those  things  the one  just now  that I  was laughing  at  or the  one before  the one  before  didn't have  the big  boobs  she had  the nice  face  she reminds  me of  an old  fuck  I used  to have  that  I think  what you  were looking  at was  the same  girl  after her  makeover  I'm not  shitting you  I think  that was  her  after her  makeover  I had a  fat girl  like that  that would  just let  me fuck  her in  the basement  of my  old apartment  building  like the  communal  basement  where people  store their 
[02:58:30]  big wheels  and shit  and I would  just make  a makeshift  she wasn't  good enough  to be above  ground  oh and she  would just  let me jerk  off on her  in the basement  and not even  come in the  house  like she  it was  you know  she just  let you  take your  fantasies out  of just  objectifying  a bitch  sometimes  you just  want to  do that  not with  a fat  bitch  and those  big tits  aren't even  fucking tits  at that point  they're big  sloppy  soft  messes  no  not all  the time  I like 
[02:59:00]  them firm  heavy  and  no not  necessarily  heavy  they don't  have to  be heavy  but I  mean  firm  not these  big strands  of long  fucking  hanging flesh  with nipples  that you  gotta lift up  the tit  to see  there's some  that look  like  the bible  slingshot  like  David and  Goliath  like if you  put a  grapefruit  in a sock  and it's  just like  a ball  of titty  meat  at the  bottom  where the  stomach  is  not one 
[02:59:30]  of those  I'm talking  about  heavy  hangy  like big  giant  tits  with a  big ring  around  a nipple  just big  fat  tits  and a  pretty face  so get  you over  man  and fat  girls never  stink  there's not  a guy  out there  that fucks  fat women  and he'll  say  her pussy  stunk  cause they  doubly wash  cause they're  conscious of  their fatness  you're shitting me  pretty girls  will have a  stink pussy  sometimes  cause they  think their  prettiness  will keep  it clean  really  the prettiness 
[03:00:00]  will flush  it out  fat chick  scrub that  thing  you'll never  find a  smelly fat  chick  it don't  happen  not one  that fucks  aren't there areas  they can't  fucking get to  there's areas  that's probably  tough  but they'll  ask you  to wash  it  I can't  imagine  that fat  chick  actually  getting in  a shower  and being  able to  reach her  ass  to wash  it  what is 
[03:00:30]  some guy  gonna get  in there  and eat  her ass  in the  shower  just because  she's in  the shower  she'll wash  it dude  she'll make  sure it's  clean  they have  those brushes  she'll get  on her  tippy toes  and squat  down a little  bit and get  on her  tippy toes  and do the  best she  can  she'll  break a  broomstick  in half  and wrap  a face  cloth  around it  like an  old torch  from a  vampire movie  like the  villagers  chasing

[03:05:30]  that there's a piece  of shit like me  all that  she gets her share  of dick  all she needs  is some dick  and a job  and that's her life  she gets dick  know what her dumps  must look like  her what  her dumps  when she takes a dump  probably not a lot  because she probably  eats a lot of beef  and shit  it's probably just  small hard ones  she is a wreck  she really is a wreck  dude look at those  tits  those round  listen to her  talking herself up  listen to what  she's saying  I'd rather try to 
[03:06:00]  understand old school  rap songs  than your theory  on this shit  why would you do that  no underwear  no bra  I mean that's just  how I dress  I'm sexy  that's where I like  to go  she cannot look  in a mirror  and think she's sexy  she's sexy  she's wearing  Fred Mertz's  underpants  she absolutely does  you know why  cause there's a piece  of garbage like me  on Tuesday  just holding  those fat tits  and looking behind  her in the mirror  going you're hot  but Wayne 
[03:06:30]  you know something  after all these guys  are fucking her  and they  they want her  to leave  doesn't she know  I'm not sexy  I'm just a fucking  whore  she gets in  where she fits in  dude how is she  how can you be sexy  wearing Bruno  San Martino's  wrestling shorts  because  she would have  wore something else  if they let her  fucking  you gotta be kidding  me  look at that  roll of  secondary fat 
[03:07:00]  on her  there's a thousand  motherfuckers  that fucked that girl  just like me  no shit  no shit  no why  oh they're gonna  give her a little  makeover  look at though  and her tits have  no stretch marks  see I can get  past the stomach  these are tears of joy  don't you know that  alright  we don't need the  makeover  the makeover part  is stupid  there you go  oh there's fat  white girl  there's a problem  here  oh god 
[03:07:30]  her belly  her belly button  was where her hip  was  and this is  and that was a  problem  that's a problem  and the white girl  was a problem  there's a problem  but there's no  difference between  this last one  and that one to you  oh yeah  no no difference  there's no difference  at all  no difference  between the white one  and that one either  they did the coming up  with that beach ball  with tits  the one I just said  I would fuck  was not shaped 
[03:08:00]  differently than those  two that they showed  no she was shaped  differently but I put her  in the same category  she's in the same  world  she's the same  weight class  the category of yuck  there's no yucks  that you ever wanted  to fuck  nothing  there's no unsexy bra  that you thought was sexy  you never want to fuck  Carly Simon  that big mouth mess  but it's something  about her  at least she was  like thin  but it was  she's a horrid  looking woman  but you'd fuck her  there's something sexy  about her  I'd fuck an ugly 
[03:08:30]  face chick  in a second  before I fucked  a fat girl  Karen Black  remember Karen Black  yeah Karen Black  with the funny teeth  weird looking lady  back in the old days  when she was like  how about Linda Blair  when she got older  Linda Blair  you'd fuck Linda Blair  there in a second  she's a strange  looking broad  Rick James fucked her  she's a strange  looking broad  but if there's  something about her  you'd fuck her  you're calling Linda Blair  strange looking  yes  she's not a hot  but she's sexy  and that fat bitch  you're fucking drooling  over that fat bitch 
[03:09:00]  and calling Linda Blair  fucking  I didn't say  she's a fat hog  this bitch  I know that  alright listen  we got a dude  from Idaho  Jeremy  let's go to Jeremy  on line two there  Stan  wife's big  Jeremy what do you got  hey I need to ask  some advice  Patrice  alright  the first couple  of girls  that I dated  long term  were big girls  and you're completely  right  they work really  hard to please you  they really  did what they  thought they needed  to do 
[03:09:30]  my wife though  is a big girl  and she  I hardly ever get  any because  she's ashamed  of her size  well  I mean  that's because  her self esteem  she has too much  self esteem  this is the difference  between that black girl  and your wife  that was on  is that black girl  she gets in  where she fits in  your wife  you gotta tell  your wife  listen  you're not  playing the same  position  that this one  is playing  you have a  different role 
[03:10:00]  that you fucking  have to  and I've used  the term  loose of role  she's not  a high level  your wife  should be  fucking  because she's  a fat girl  that's the thing  about fat girls  there's some  shit  they can't  have the  dignity  of other  women  right  they should  be giving  up pussy  you can't  hold out  like a  fucking  10  you're supposed  to be  giving me  the fucking  energy  or the  self esteem  I need  so that I  can chase  these sexy  bitches  that's their  commodity  that's what

Only a couple more minutes of stuff.  Alright, let's get to the end of this.  Notice  that your floor was open. I mean...  Phil,  yes, your story made me  a little horny, you know?  I got a  harm one. Yes, doctor. 
[03:46:00]  You know,  can I tell you this?  I guess  it got me pretty hot, too.  I mean, since this is  re-association and all.  I'm just remembering all that.  I mean, look at  my pussy, doctor.  Oh, doctor.  See how it's dripping?  That's when you know I'm hot.  Oh, really?  I must confess  while you're telling  the pest  I beat off three times. 
[03:46:30]  What?  What the fuck?  You can't even understand  what he's saying.  He's doing such a horrid accent.  He beat off three times  when?  Yeah, I think what he was  trying to say was  in previous sessions.  Oh.  Oh, with her?  It sounds to me like  the first session  they would have been  going at it.  I don't find this  very accurate.  Yeah.  Why is my pussy  so dripping wet?  Ah, you're depressed.  Yeah.  There you go.  Some drugs  and cotton swabs.  Take care of yourself. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  Continue there.  Oh, this business  are so expensive.  Well, we could work it out,  I'm sure.  Just let me suck your cup.  Well, you've got  a couple of minutes  like this.  Oh, now,  do it gently.  Keep away from my balls.  Don't touch it.  Oh, well, well, well.  It's going to burst  in just a second.  Oh, come on.  Keep the hands  away from the trigger.  Oh, it feels good. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, I think I'd better  lie on my couch.  Oh, keep talking that.  Oh, this is my fault  with our black blood.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Daddy, daddy.  Oh, I think I should do that.  Oh, oh.  Oh.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Don't touch the balls.  He really is concerned  about her touching  those balls. 
[03:48:00]  What's wrong there?  It can be nine so horny.  Patrice, what's wrong?  Yes, Patrice.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you're just watching TV.  What happened to you?  Oh, my God.  What happened?  It was a dude  with no bottom half,  just walking on his hands.  Oh, yeah.  Jerry's into those guys.  Jerry's freak show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Okay.  How much time we got  left in this one?  After Maury's freak show.  Last track, 50 seconds.  Okay.  The end.  This one's not as good 
[03:48:30]  as you dumb.  Nah.  That chick is the star.  I couldn't not give you guys  the awful.  Yeah, the Nazi guy  is pretty bad.  This girl is sexy, you know.  Like, I don't mind this girl.  Yeah, I like her better  than Grandma.  All right, let's get  to the end of this one.  This session.  Oh, oh, oh.  Let me get this thing out  because I'm going to be there.  Oh, oh, oh.  Can I want?  Oh, oh, oh.  It's finally going soft.  Oh, oh, oh, yes. 
[03:49:00]  That was, oh, boy.  That was a good one.  Oh, that was a good one.  It was delicious, Dr. Ron Palace,  and I want to thank you.  Oh, that's okay.  I'm finished coming.  God damn it.  I mean, you got to get out of here.  I'll see you next week.  Yeah, next week.  Why is he throwing our nose?  I don't know.  That was 15 minutes of a session. 
[03:49:30]  She still had 45 minutes for her.  Why don't you try to help the bitch?  You got a problem.  Oh, boy, we're going to see you a lot, I think.  Why does this accent keep changing?  And who's knocking on the fucking door?  He's kicking her.  That's why he has to get her out of there.  Yeah, because the next appointment's coming.  And the next appointment wants in right now?  Hi, doc.  Hey, motherfucker.  It's my turn.  You fabulous prick.  It'll be that other bitch.  Yeah, that is some audio from an A-track from the 70s. 
[03:50:00]  That's pretty good, man.  And there's still more when that came.  I don't know where those were.  Like, I consider myself pretty up-to-date on 70s trivia and pop culture of the day.  I don't remember ever hearing about those.  They sold, like, four of them.  That's why.  I figured you'd find one in Dad's night table or something when he went snooping. 
[03:50:30]  What's this?  Oh, Dad's a pervert.  I remember going through my parents' night table drawers when I was a kid.  And there was a birthday card in there that was like, happy birthday.  And then you open it up.  And it was a cartoon of a naked guy with this giant fucking dick.  And he's holding it.  And he goes, happy birthday, you big prick.  And it was just like this big guy holding a big prick.  You know your dad got the card from your mom.  That's got to be kind of creepy.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, it was kind of creepy.  You know, eight tracks, there was no rewinding and no fast-forwarding.  No.  You had to listen.  If you thought you heard a guy sucking cum out of a twat, you had to just know you heard it.  Well, you could start.  You could just switch tracks.  Or you had to start over.  You could just go, chick, chick, and switch.  And it'd be in the middle of another song or track.  You could do that four times.  All right, we got to get out of here.  We got a meeting.  Standing by.  We got Line of the Day first.  And we got Patrice playing Punchline, San Francisco. 
[03:51:30]  Yes, sir.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Punchline, San Francisco.  One show Thursday, two Friday, two Saturday.  And if any of the POWs make it to Patrice's show, make sure you say hi.  Right?  Yeah.  Come down and see Patrice.  What's POW?  Pass Out West.  Pass Out West.  They're pretty strong.
