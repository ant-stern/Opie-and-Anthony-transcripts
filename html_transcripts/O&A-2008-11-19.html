<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of the winter solstice, one host declaring it his favorite day. This segued into a quickly dismissed joke about a potential studio firing, before turning to critical commentary on Silda Spitzer's appearance and public apologies following her husband's scandal. The hosts then speculated on the Somali pirate crisis, discussing the pirates' motivations and the challenges of military intervention.  A caller working on oil tankers provided firsthand accounts of pirate attacks, sparking a debate on the effectiveness of RPGs against tankers.  Drew Boogie, a musician, made a brief in-studio appearance before a commercial break.

Post-break, the show covered sports, focusing on Celtics and Cavaliers wins, before transitioning into a lengthy segment on the Harlem Globetrotters, fueled by a superfan, Ted, who shared numerous anecdotes. This discussion included the Globetrotters’ history, racial aspects of their performances, and a scathing review of a poorly-made *Gilligan's Island* movie featuring the team.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a female astronaut losing a tool bag in space, followed by commentary on Thomas Beattie, a pregnant transgender man, criticizing media portrayals and playing a clip from Greg Gutfeld’s *Red Eye* satirizing the situation.  Barbara Walters' interview with Gutfeld was also mentioned, along with a woman who fell victim to a Nigerian email scam.  Throughout this portion, the hosts employed crude language and offensive jokes, with Drew Boogie providing live audio mixes.  Stephen Farley, a chef from Basil Teas who caters Anthony's parties, was also mentioned.


The show continued with extensive and highly offensive commentary on Thomas Beattie's pregnancy and appearance, focusing on the perceived hypocrisy of media coverage.  A listener email demanding an apology was met with a sarcastic and offensive response. The discussion expanded to encompass transgender identity, the concept of fifteen minutes of fame, and media hypocrisy. This segment also featured more discussions of victims of Nigerian email scams, including a caller whose mother repeatedly fell prey to the same scam and a listener-submitted "FU" line filled with profanity.  LeBron James' free agency, an upcoming Tom Jones concert, and audio clips mocking the aforementioned Globetrotters *Gilligan's Island* movie were also discussed. Drew Boogie remained in-studio, mixing audio.

The next segment concentrated on listener calls detailing various scams, particularly Nigerian email scams. Callers shared stories of their parents and other family members falling victim, with one caller being a law enforcement officer confirming the scam's prevalence.  Other scams involving Craigslist roommates and car sales were also discussed. This segued into Anthony's intense personal feud with Gene Simmons, stemming from an alleged inappropriate advance towards a female coworker and subsequent disrespect towards Anthony. Anthony expressed extreme anger, outlining plans for a verbal, and potentially physical, confrontation with Simmons.  Humorous moments arose from listener anecdotes and creative suggestions for handling scam perpetrators.  A news story about a driver crashing into the Charles River after sneezing was also briefly mentioned.

A pre-recorded phone conversation between Anthony and Gene Simmons was played, featuring Anthony’s highly offensive and vulgar tirade against Simmons, accusing him of being a "money-grubbing asshole" and threatening physical violence.  Listeners called in with advice and opinions.  This was followed by a live interview with Angus Young of AC/DC.  Topics included the band's continued CD sales, Angus's schoolboy stage persona, touring experiences, the band's history (including Bon Scott's death and Brian Johnson's replacement), and AC/DC tribute bands.  Angus was portrayed as relaxed and good-humored.  The segment included a humorous “Dr. Love” caller, irrelevant listener advice, a playful scolding of E-Rock by Opie for a mistake, and brief mentions of Sarah Jessica Parker, Bill Donahue, Barack Obama, and the studio’s heat. A Jeff Goldblum impersonation referencing a previous interview concluded this section, along with a short clip of Gene Simmons making an offensive comment about Anthony’s girlfriend.

The final segment focused on listener calls responding to the prompt, "What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?"  This included discussions of comedic impressions of Barry Katz (with Frank Caliendo mentioned), Jim Norton's upcoming stand-up shows (including appearances at Caesars Palace and with Chelsea Handler), and further, extremely vulgar, angry outbursts from Anthony directed at Gene Simmons, including a threat to “rip his fucking wig off.”  Listener calls ranged from observations related to the show’s content to completely unrelated and often absurd claims.  One caller detailed hauling mozzarella cheese, leading to humorous scenarios, while another discussed Kiss songs.  Bobby Big Ringer, a caller, discussed his mozzarella delivery job, prompting more vulgar jokes.  The segment was characterized by vulgar banter, frequent interruptions, and abrupt topic changes.  Jim Norton was the only guest identified in the studio besides the regular hosts.  WebEx.com was mentioned as a sponsor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  I love that new intro.  Effin' cold outside here in New York.  What's that about? I guess winter?  Winter is something like that, I think they call it.  That dumb winter is upon us.  When's the winter solstice?  December 21st.  Is that the solstice?  Little known fact, it's my favorite day of the year. 
[00:00:30]  Is it?  Not Christmas, not my birthday.  The solstice.  Gregory loves the solstice.  I love the solstice.  My God, Ted loves the solstice.  It's a delicious word.  It sounds like a word Ted likes a lot.  Oh, it's fun with a capital S.  I love the solstice.  The solstice.  Because it's the shortest day of the year, and then it just gets better from that day on.  That's right.  Every day, what, about a minute? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, about a minute a day, more of daylight.  And that's why it's absolutely my favorite day of the year.  I mean, we should celebrate that somehow.  The solstice.  Well, somebody's got to celebrate my favorite day of the year.  I'm not asking for birthday gifts.  None of that crap.  I want solstice.  Oh, Gregory wants solstice.  Celebration.  Between now and the 21st, it just sucks.  Because, you know, it's getting darker and darker and darker.  Really?  Who needs it to get dark at 3.30 in the afternoon? 
[00:01:30]  It's just stupid.  I know.  It is depressing.  All right.  Lots to do today.  877-212-O&A.  I see they're setting up breakfast.  Yes.  Who's getting fired today?  Yeah, what does this mean?  Who's getting fired today?  I came in.  I smelled some wonderful food.  And I was like, uh-oh.  Yeah, exactly.  Remember the days when you smelled bacon?  And you're like, nice.  Now it's like, nice, uh-oh. 
[00:02:00]  Who will it be today?  It's not, uh, this is basil tea.  It's a different restaurant.  Oh, we love the basil tea.  Trust me.  I don't think there's a firing today.  This might be, you know, better.  Way to go with the bit, stump brain.  Way to go with the bit.  You're terrific.  How many years in the business?  Apparently one.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Literal stump brain.  I know.  Oh, no, no firings.  We knew they were coming.  All right, good.  I got to start knocking on some doors in Hollywood because my acting is terrific these days. 
[00:02:30]  Stunt brain's been doing radio for 30 years in New York and he can't figure it out.  You didn't get it.  I didn't get it?  Yeah.  You're crazy.  I was layering.  No.  I didn't say no firings.  Oh, I was layering.  Yes.  No, you're crazy.  Don't make us pull out your old radio tapes.  Please.  Please.  Oh, they're sitting there.  They're just waiting.  All right.  A quick comment. 
[00:03:00]  It's hilarious.  The front page of one of the rags here in New York.  I used to call them newspapers, but you really can't call them newspapers anymore.  I don't get real news from these things anymore.  I kind of...  Bottom of the birdcage lining.  Pretty much.  Oh, good gravy.  Pretty much.  But one of the rags, it says on the front page, Spitzer, Hooker, first interview, sorry,  Silda.  Yeah.  So this broad who looks a lot older than her age.  Mm-hmm.  How old is she supposed to be? 
[00:03:30]  15.  22?  Oh.  Well, she looks about 30 easily.  What happened to all the hot, sexy pictures of her in the bikini during the summer?  Or just nude covering her babies with her hands.  Because she's not that hot to begin with.  And she's parading around, talking about the Elliot Spitzer thing, where she was the hooker,  obviously.  And the front page of the paper, sorry, Silda.  Sorry.  She wants to say sorry to Elliot Spitzer's wife. 
[00:04:00]  Sorry you have a horrid name.  Right.  Silda.  As she makes it hurt even more by being on the front page of the newspaper.  Yeah, she's got to kind of resurface.  She's been gone.  They might have even been, you know, getting over some hurdles.  Right.  But if she was truly sorry, she would have said no to every single interview.  She wouldn't be on, what is it, Good Morning America, or whatever the hell that one is with  Diane Sawyer.  Yeah.  She wouldn't be on the front page of the paper.  She wouldn't have an exclusive interview in the paper today. 
[00:04:30]  She would just say, look, I've done enough damage, I've hurt Silda tremendously, so I  have chosen to just move on with my life.  You can't say sorry, Silda, and do all these interviews.  No.  Because that just makes it hurt a little more.  Not that we care, but we like pointing out the hypocrisy of this stuff.  She is sexy, though.  God.  You think so?  Oh.  I don't see it, Jimmy.  Oh, dude.  You like that?  Fantastic.  What do you like about her?  Pretty face.  She has nice skin.  That's a pretty face?  Not in that shop, but in a lot of the other ones she is, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Well, she was wearing glasses, sunglasses.  That's what made her face a bit pretty.  Yeah.  Those eyes are way too close together, man.  She has a great body.  She's got the Seinfeld eyes.  Yeah.  She's got club soda Kenny eyes.  Yeah.  She's got the nice boobies.  That's about it for me, man.  You like the eyes close together, huh, Jim?  Dude, I did not notice.  I never would think of that.  The eyes too close?  No.  If there was one in the middle of her head, it wouldn't bother me.  I enjoy a pretty face. 
[00:05:30]  I don't think...  I don't know.  Yeah, I like a pretty face, too, but...  You think she has a pretty face?  That's good.  Yeah, great body.  Nice boobies.  That's about it.  Look at the picture with Diane Sawyer.  I don't know.  That is not a good-looking broad.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Look at that.  Come on.  Let me see.  We see way hotter girls that just come by and hang out to watch the radio show than that  mess.  Yeah, she's pretty, but she's dressing...  In that Diane Sawyer shot, she's trying to be business-like. 
[00:06:00]  She's not slutting it up.  I like when she sluts it up.  Now, if you Google image her, like the shot with her topless with the librarian glasses on,  that's a fine shot.  Absolutely.  So maybe it depends on...  Now, that's...  That's all right.  I can't complain about that shot whatsoever.  The glasses kind of make her eyes look further apart.  Right, with the puffy lips, and you got the whole thing going on.  But the picture's today in the paper.  I'm not feeling it.  Nice hips. 
[00:06:30]  Nice...  Nice birthing hips.  Birthing.  Nice birthing hips.  Probably not.  Nice abortion hips.  She's a whore.  Yeah, I guess she wouldn't keep the kids, huh?  Who knows?  No.  Who knows?  So we got that going on, and then you got these...  You got these pirates, these Somalian pirates.  When are we going to pick them off?  Yeah, these guys got to be dealt with in the harshest manner. 
[00:07:00]  I think I'm secretly rooting for them, though, because it's just completely insane what they've  been able to accomplish.  Well, it's because no one's really doing anything.  They just kind of steal ships, and people just go, eh, they're pirates.  That's what they do.  And then once they get them into that little Somali, little harbor thing there, they can  do whatever they want, because they got the warlords.  What's...  Really?  Actual warlords?  There's warlords there.  I thought that was just in video games.  There's actual warlords?  They sell it off to the warlords. 
[00:07:30]  The warlords.  Yes.  Warlords.  And they perform wizardry with this?  Wizardry.  Because that's the only way they're going to get the oil off this thing.  Yeah, I don't know how they're going to do that.  Just hose the people down with oil.  Anyone else notice the one guy looks just like Omar from The Wire?  Yeah.  Looks like Omar has some family members that enjoy pirating.  In Somalia.  Yeah, these guys, now apparently the United States military is getting involved.  You know, steaming over there and going to have some chit-chats with the guys.  The pirates seem really bad at doing anything but taking the ship. 
[00:08:00]  Once anyone comes aboard, they just die very easily.  They get shot up and die and surrender, the other people.  Because they probably never expect that they could actually pull it off.  Their lives are so boring.  They're like, what the hell?  Let's see if we can do this.  Yeah.  And then they get on board and they have a whole now what thing going on.  Now what?  Now what do we do?  Now that we pull this off.  They have no idea what to do once they do it.  Because I think a French yacht was taken and the French sent some frigate, a French frigate, to follow the yacht. 
[00:08:30]  And they had some, like their version of the seals.  Right.  Kind of go into the water, pop up on the yacht, blasted one of the pirates.  And the rest of them just said, okay, give up.  And that was that.  Freed them.  I think it's going to be a lot harder on that oil tanker. 
[00:09:00]  You know, I don't know how much firing you could do on an oil tanker.  Yeah, I don't know.  But, you know, without making a giant ecological disaster if you lob a shell into it or something.  And they don't know how many pirates are actually on board that.  It's a lot bigger than the yacht that the French freed.  But apparently there's, what, like seven or eight of these ships right now being held?  Eighteen.  Eighteen?  They've got 18 of these ships.  They currently control 18 ships and more than 350 crew members. 
[00:09:30]  How did they get away with this?  It's been going on for at least a year.  They've been grabbing ships as they come through that passage.  Yeah, we see these stories pop up over the year.  I didn't know they were holding 18 ships.  Just starve them.  Yeah, starve them out.  I think that's what they're trying to do.  They surrounded them.  I can't imagine, like, the oil tankers have a nice food area, a nice cafeteria.  You think they have a lot of food?  Yeah, they've probably got a lot.  This tanker is bigger than three aircraft carriers. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, I read that.  That's how big that thing is.  But the problem is the crew that's on these ships, they're going to live starving, too.  They've got to eat.  Yeah, but you know what?  It sucks to be them.  If you're stupid enough to let a Somalian pirate take over your ship, what do you want from us?  You see the tiny little dinghies?  They come up to the boat and they take over your big, huge oil tanker, and now we're supposed to save you?  No.  Everyone starves.  How about this?  We worry about the spending.  How about the U.S. doesn't get involved with a Saudi ship?  Well, then our gas will go up, Jimmy. 
[00:10:30]  This will be a great excuse to get the gas up there again.  The Saudis apparently don't have any type of response for this.  They don't have the type of military that can go out and do this.  Oh, so the lapdog Americans will do it.  Yeah, exactly.  You want to talk about tax money?  This is an example.  When people say, well, we make a lot of money, pay taxes, you, Anthony, like Dennis said to you.  Yes.  How about, you don't send a U.S. ship to go over there and do something, some other country's business.  Let them do it.  They should do. 
[00:11:00]  Let them do it.  Yeah.  Not the lapdog Americans.  Well, we'll do it.  And then somehow we'll still be the a-holes of the world.  Yeah.  So we have to take over 18 of these ships or are we just going to help out a few of them?  Pick and choose.  There's probably a couple of countries that we really don't care about.  It's like, yeah, good luck to you.  You deal with that one.  Yeah.  We'll deal with the one that helps us the most, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Saudis, got to help them.  It's a great story, though.  It is really amazing that these idiots in these little boats. 
[00:11:30]  But the dumb RPG, right?  Yeah.  They got RPGs and AK-47s and they just pop up on these ships.  I look at some of this stuff in video game terms.  Now, you're in a video game.  You're in a tiny little dinghy with an RPG and your mission is to take over the oil tank  or the video game.  Yeah.  You would be at that mission for days trying to figure out the dumb little tiny little loophole.  Yeah.  How do you do it?  I think what they do is they race up on it and just board it. 
[00:12:00]  You know?  But you can see it coming.  The little thing can go faster.  They got like little Zodiacs or something or little crappy boats, but they go faster  than the tanker.  Right.  So they go up to that little staircase, you know, like right down the side and they jump  on with their guns.  But the thing is...  How about when they get to the top of the stairs, you step on their hands?  Step on their hands and kick them in the face.  I mean, what else?  What else do you need to do?  They get scared.  I think the people on the boats. 
[00:12:30]  You're talking in video game terms.  I'm thinking if you're the guy, a guy on the tanker.  Right.  You got to do something.  Right.  Yeah.  You got to throw like whatever you got.  There's got to be a bowling alley on that thing, right?  It's that long.  Bowling balls down on them.  Yeah.  Something silly.  I wonder if they threatened to sink the ship somehow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you got an RPG pointed at the side of the tanker.  I would imagine that can't sink the thing.  Yeah, I would.  I'm just guessing.  I would too.  I'm just guessing.  There's got to be a couple layers, right?  Of something. 
[00:13:00]  They shot a cruise ship with an RPG and it left a little black market.  It looked like someone put a big giant cigarette out on it.  We got a guy that works on the oil tankers.  John in Kings Park.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I want to say hi to all the old.  Ah, well, whatever.  I just want to say hi to the old dudes that are at the hall out there in Kings Park.  My dad's old hangout.  What do you got, John?  Well, basically how this works is they come up alongside the ships with what's much worse 
[00:13:30]  than a Zodiac.  It's actually like a wooden shell with an engine on it.  Yeah.  They have grappling hooks and these dudes are actually quite strong.  So they throw a hook up on the side of what's called a fish plate, which is the ridge on  the end of the ship.  They rip off the sides of the ship.  When they get on board, usually you know they're coming.  You can see them coming up alongside the ship.  They do use fire hoses, the fire suppression equipment on the ship.  So they have these giant, you know, thousand gallon an hour pumps with six inch lines that 
[00:14:00]  the guys on board are actually spraying them with the hoses.  But the dudes are, you know, poor and they need to get on board to get money.  So they're right up the side of the ship and on board.  Once they're on board, they have knives and guns.  You on board do not.  So usually they get on pretty quick.  Why can't you guys have guns on board?  Well, they used to have guns on board.  But what happened was, you know, back in the day, they reduced it to the fact that just  the officers could have guns.  Yeah.  And then once the officers just had guns, then it was the drama involved with insuring  a giant vessel filled with oil with weaponry on board, which is just too expensive. 
[00:14:30]  Insurance.  There you go.  So what they do now, basically, is once they get on board, they overcome the crew.  They go into their safe haven, as you guys explained.  Once they're in the safe haven, no one really helps.  They just watch the ship.  Right.  And their friends bring out food for the crew and for the pirates.  Right.  In exchange for which they steal all the electronic equipment off the ship, including the stuff  that locates the actual vessel.  Oh, see, I didn't even think of that.  There's probably other things that they, like, salvage from the ship. 
[00:15:00]  So they come on board, they take radars, they take radio equipment, the GPSs, all the stuff  that's worth money.  And they get, like, a car thief, pennies on the dollar for this stuff.  Car thief.  But it's enough to feed their families for, you know, months.  I was going to say years.  Yeah.  And they never really sell the air because they're not technically capable enough to  actually pump the stuff off the vessel.  What they do is the vessel itself, which could be anywhere from $30 to $130 million, and the  crew hostage, they usually steal what's called, crews have a draw. 
[00:15:30]  They can take up to 30% of their wages off as a draw to spend cash ashore.  So they steal that right out of the safe right away.  Then they go after the companies for anywhere from $2 to $10 million, which, for the ships,  which sometimes earn upwards of $100,000 a day, it's worth it to pay the $2 million just  to get the ship earning again.  And they actually do give the ships back with the people on it?  Absolutely.  Now, there are times, time to time, people do get killed during it where somebody tries 
[00:16:00]  to overcome one of the guys or something like that.  But for the most part, the crew gets released unharmed, maybe a few pounds lighter, and the  company's just happy to have them back to pump the cargo off.  And keep the ship making the $100,000 a day.  Amazing.  Imagine what you could do with $2 million in Somalia.  You could buy it.  Leave Somalia.  Leave Somalia and get a one-bedroom in Manhattan.  Yeah.  I would just stay in Somalia and build a compound. 
[00:16:30]  Well, thanks for the info, John.  All right.  Enjoy, guys.  All right.  Peace.  That makes sense.  And now we got a dummy in Philly.  Billy, you're a dummy.  How you doing, gentlemen?  You're a dummy.  You're a dummy.  You're a dummy.  I love you doing that right.  You're a dummy.  I'll be there.  You're a dummy.  I'll be there.  Dumb.  Anyway, an RPG with oil.  It's an oil tanker.  One little simple spark makes it a little machinery you can blow up.  It's a chain reaction, guys.  You need oil, air, and accelerant.  I would bet a lot of money that an RPG will not blow up an oil tanker most of the time. 
[00:17:00]  Maybe one of these things will get lucky, but you've got to think that there's some precautions  here.  You've got to think there's layering of the ship.  There is.  They're double-walled.  Right.  They've had to be for years.  Yeah.  Okay.  So you're saying...  RPG is not like in the movies.  Right.  RPG is not like in the movies.  It doesn't make a huge explosion.  I think if you put the RPG right against the oil tanker and fire, it's not going to blow  that damn thing up.  But you're not thinking that probably if you see...  Strap an RPG to an Arab and throw him up against it. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  You're probably not thinking that if you see an RPG pointed at the bottom of your ship.  Yeah.  You probably know.  Like, yeah, it's fine.  Right.  But if you're sitting on the oil, you're probably like, yeah, let's...  I don't know.  Are we sure that this is going to...  Right.  It's easy to say if you're, like, not on the oil.  Yeah.  Right.  You're floating on oil.  If you've got an oil tanker filled with marshmallows or something, ah, whatever.  But you're right, Jimmy.  I've got to fire away.  All right, maybe Bill is not a dummy.  Maybe. 
[00:18:00]  I guess if you're in that situation, you don't want to take any...  You're the guy on the oil.  Right.  But that's the issue.  It's insurance.  Right.  I guess because they're afraid weapons can discharge on there or something.  Right.  Yeah, probably.  Somebody gets shot.  They're afraid of that.  Guns.  That shows you an RPG might do something, then.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I think they ought to have them, though, locked up.  Mm-hmm.  Whatever.  You've got enough time.  You see anything coming.  I mean, it's not like you need it right away.  You could see the goddamn ship coming at you.  Yeah, but you came up with a good point yesterday. 
[00:18:30]  Get the Waterworld, you know, Waterworld.  Waterworld cannons.  The cannons.  They say they use the firefighting equipment on the boat, but apparently it doesn't work.  Someone's saying it's crude oil on the ship.  It's not flammable.  Is that true?  It's not as explosive as, like, gasoline would be, I would think.  After you process it.  Just crude oil.  It's flammable, though.  Remember, what was that movie with Daniel Day-Lewis?  Where there's the oil well fire?  You ever seen oil well fire?  That's pretty much right out of the ground.  It's filthy blood.  Yeah.  Those are oil well fire, bitch. 
[00:19:00]  I know how to solve the problem.  Because those are mixed with air, though, too.  What do you got, Jimmy?  Yeah.  They should get little sailor hats.  All right.  And when the pirates come on board, you give them all a sailor hat, and they'll be so  distracted, pretending, look, I'm a captain, that you can overtake them.  Little sailor hat defense.  Yeah, they don't know.  They'll see the hat.  They'll run around.  Look at them, Captain.  I got nice hats.  Nice.  We got to take our first break.  RPGs can't puncture a ship.  Bill in Arizona.  See, there you go.  That's what we do on this show. 
[00:19:30]  One listener tells us the answer, and we go with it.  So, according to Bill, that can happen.  That's funny.  The official word comes from a guy who lives nowhere near water.  We have Drew Boogie in studio.  We got omelets being made by Basil Teas.  Our boys on the other side of the studio.  You doing good, sir?  Doing well.  Thank you.  All right.  Last time I saw you, I think you were at Ants doing a little shindig for him.  He was there the other day.  Oh, he was doing?  Yeah.  Very nice. 
[00:20:00]  For the big anniversary party?  Yes.  For Ants.  Basil Teas.  He was for all my personal partying.  Do you also do complete sweater shrinking?  Because I'm wondering who got to Tim's.  It's like a sweater dickie.  What is that?  Sweater dickie.  It's the worst.  It's going to be the tiniest sweater ever.  Thank God, dude.  What are you doing?  We know what to get you for Christmas. 
[00:20:30]  It's awful.  It's sweater extensions.  All right.  We got Drew Boogie.  He's doing some live stuff for us today, which is awesome.  Let's say hi to Drew Boogie.  We'll take a little break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be right back. 
[00:21:00]  Bacon!  Bacon!  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Shut up! We don't care! 
[00:21:30]  How good is Drew Boogie?  Come on.  Is that good? 
[00:22:00]  When are you going to have this stuff available for download?  Very soon.  You've been saying that for years.  I gave up on you.  Very soon.  You've been saying very soon probably for six years.  Drew is a gifted bum.  He just doesn't know how to make money through his talent.  A true artist.  Oh, that's good.  A true artist, right.  I guess you're right.  Opie and Anthony, 877-212-0&A.  Quickly, you got the Celtics beating the Knicks last night.  The Knickerbockers.  Knickerbockers.  Lost to the Celtics 110-101. 
[00:22:30]  And then I got to say hi to LeBron James and the Cavalier fans because they beat the Nets 106-82.  I'm paying attention here because LeBron James, youngest person to score 11,000 points.  Yep.  In a game?  In the NBA.  In the NBA.  In the NBA.  Who held the record before LeBron James?  Anyone?  Will Chamberlain.  I'll guess the off-sender.  Anyone?  Think like a little more current.  Bradley.  Jordan.  Bill Bradley?  Yeah.  Dollar Bill?  I'm just throwing Rick Barry. 
[00:23:00]  Rick Barry?  John Starks.  We're talking when they started wearing their shorts.  Larry Bird.  Metal Ark Lemon.  They were the best.  The Globetrotters never lost, Gregory.  They were the champions of the world.  Of the world.  You guys are thinking...  I one time picked up a gum wrapper drop by Curly Neal.  He framed it.  It was a piece of Wrigley's.  He liked Wrigley's?  Curly was very fond of Wrigley's. 
[00:23:30]  Ted the super fan, I guess, huh?  Ted the Globetrotter fanatic.  Yeah, we're talking to Ted that he...  He takes it so seriously every time he goes.  The champions of the world, Daniel.  Look it up.  I bet he hopes they win.  Like he goes, I'm like, ooh, I hope they win this time.  Have you ever sweated out a game?  I certainly have.  Yeah.  Sometimes another team will come within 40 and I begin to panic.  But if you're...  There was a string on the ball.  Metal Ark threw it and came back to him.  The man is magical.  How is that allowed? 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  But if you're a super fan, you should know who they play every time.  Yes, but I'm too busy yelling, go Metal Ark and go Curly.  You don't notice they play the exact same team every single time?  No, they don't.  Yes, they do.  You had the Washington Generals.  That's not the truth.  They beat the Chicago Bulls.  They beat the Bulls.  They did so.  With what?  Michael Jordan?  Steve Jordan was one of the greatest ballplayers of all time.  And Metal Ark scored 13 points one game. 
[00:24:30]  Look, here they go.  Wow.  It's just amazing.  What about the pail of water?  But it's not water.  It turns out to be what?  Oh, Gregory.  I was so scared.  One time I was in the front with an American flag in my Globetrotters hat.  And Curly Neal threw a bucket of confetti at me.  You thought it was going to be water, right?  Yes, I tried drinking it.  You can't drink confetti, though.  No.  No.  Wow. 
[00:25:00]  Anyone?  You guys are in the short-short era of the NBA.  I said Jordan.  At first, I said Kareem, the law center.  And then I said...  No, it's not from the short-short era, which was the dumbest thing ever.  Why did the players agree to wear the short-short?  Sexy.  Sexy.  Ugh.  It would be Kobe Bryant.  Oh, Kobe.  But LeBron James now has the record.  The biggest player to go to 11,000 points.  Remember the Harlem Globetrotters cartoon?  Uh-uh, yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Where they had a basketball court on the roof of their van, and they would stop off and play.  How big is the van?  Exactly.  But it was never...  It was like they showed it with the court on the roof as they're driving, but then when  they're playing, it was giant.  It was a regular-sized basketball court.  Yeah.  And then they'd be driving, and it's just a little court.  Never understood that.  And I realized it's a cartoon.  Geese Osby was one of them, I'm remembering.  There was Metal Ark.  There was Curly Neal.  There was Geese Osby.  I think they traveled a lot. 
[00:26:00]  Yes.  A lot of traveling that was never...  Oh, yeah.  They had to play in a lot of cities.  No, no.  I mean...  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Traveling on the court.  Yeah, see.  I flipped that.  Uh-oh.  Look, he touched the guy.  That's got to be a foul.  That's got to be a homo.  You can't be a homo.  What he just did.  A homo.  Screw a foul.  That's a homo.  And these guys...  They were into, you know, the homo.  They really were amazing players.  It's like, how come these guys didn't go to the NBA and play?  Yeah.  Because they had the incredible skills, but they didn't have, like... 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's a good question.  You would think they could just...  You know, do these crazy tricks in the NBA.  Then again, why not just be one of the Globetrotters?  And be...  I mean, it's probably more prestigious to be one of the Globetrotters.  Is it?  Yeah.  Making $30,000 a year as the NBA players make millions?  That's not what they do.  I don't think these guys make a lot of money.  And then they had to, like, throw a broad in there.  Why are we talking about the Harlem Globetrotters?  Because we like sweet Georgia Brown.  Because...  Ted loves the team.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:27:00]  Yes, I do.  I didn't like when she played.  Oh, no.  No!  Get that vagina out of here!  Keith Osby is trying to roll the ball.  With a string like a bowling ball and catch it.  Yeah, they went with the gimmick and they got the first female to be on the Globetrotters.  I don't know if that worked out too well.  Sometimes I'd be watching it.  It would be hard to tell the Globetrotters from the team they were killing.  And then someone said, they're the black ones.  I'm like, oh, God, I need to notice.  You don't notice black or white?  I don't see color, Gregory. 
[00:27:30]  I see only hat size.  You want to talk about racism.  Ted's an ass.  They made sure they played the horrible white team every time.  Yes.  The Washington generals were always the horrible white team.  All white.  All white against the black guys.  Every single time.  Look, see?  If you go on YouTube, I think it says the best of the Globetrotters.  There's some great footage going back to black and white times.  Yeah.  Well, you're just talking about that?  Yeah, right.  Oh, you mean the color of the film or the video? 
[00:28:00]  When everyone wore a suit to a sporting event?  Yeah.  How uncomfortable was that?  It just looked very uncomfortable back in the oldie days where you had to wear suits  everywhere, apparently.  Baseball games?  Yeah, you watch old movies and they're all, no matter where they went out to eat, it's  always, hello, dear.  Hi, honey.  Come in.  I'm wearing a suit.  Why did it take so long for one dummy to stand up and go, look, this is really uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I'm not going to wear my suit anymore.  I'm going to wear, like, jeans and a t-shirt. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to throw a weird hat on my head instead of that, instead of that, uh, that, uh.  The fedora.  The fedora hat.  Our ancestors were stupid.  You look at the old beach footage and you see the broads in their, in their flowing gowns  trying to go for a dip in the ocean.  You know how uncomfortable that must be?  Yeah.  First of all, you're, you're hot as hell because you're, you have too much clothes on.  Then you do decide to go in the water in this flowing dress thing.  Now you're, you're wet with sand in the thing.  Yeah.  And no one could figure out that this is not a good thing? 
[00:29:00]  You can wear as little as possible.  They were very, uh, scared that people were going to see, uh, the female form.  A kneecap or something.  Yeah.  And, and freak out or something.  All right.  Um.  Yeah, there they are.  Look at those.  That's sexy.  That's supposed to be sexy.  They couldn't even figure out that you could walk on the sand without shoes and socks on.  Yeah.  They, they're wearing shoes and socks.  Like what was the danger of like putting your tootsies in the sand?  No one told the broads. 
[00:29:30]  Look at it.  They got the like, like knee high socks on and, and some kind of like lady shoe on.  Yeah.  What the, what's the logic in that?  The one girl has high heels on.  That's the left.  The flapper.  She looks like a flapper.  She's just dumb.  I mean, back then didn't know.  She was probably like 19, that girl.  She looks, she looks, she looks like she's in her forties.  Oh, she looks horrendous.  They were terrible.  They, they, they were stupid, the women back then.  They thought the, the sand was made of linoleum.  They had no idea.  They'd never been there.  Yeah.  What does this stuff feel like on my shoes? 
[00:30:00]  We'll get some, uh, pictures up on onaradio.com and the Globetrotter video that we were just  watching.  Sure.  All right, uh, moving on.  This is a quickie, but man, is it a great video.  We should link this to the, uh, female astronaut working on the, uh, the, uh, the Endeavor.  Special Endeavor.  Special Endeavor.  She's on the Endeavor.  And what?  She was outside the, uh, the shuttle doing some repairs.  Doing a little extra vehicular activity. 
[00:30:30]  She had a toolbox, right?  Yeah.  She had a, uh, tool bag.  A tool bag?  They have a little tool bag.  Special Endeavor.  Yes.  Yes.  On the.  Special Endeavor.  And she was outside the.  Special Endeavor.  And next thing you know, what?  Her tool bag just floated away into the space.  Yeah.  Oh, I lost my purse.  Pretty much what amounts to lost her purse in space.  The video is, uh, well, this one's going to be played everywhere today, huh? 
[00:31:00]  Don't you think?  Oh, there's video of it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they videotape everything these people do.  And what did she say?  Something like, oops or something?  Well, you'll hear it, but she let go of the tool bag because apparently, according to  her, a putty gun exploded.  A putty gun?  Yeah, there were a couple putty guns, putty knife, and some mitts.  She should be used to putty guns exploding by this point in her life.  Explode right in her face.  Exactly.  Oh, could you stop chewing the end of the putty gun?  Yeah, stop.  It's very dangerous. 
[00:31:30]  It'll shoot you in the face.  Yeah, well, here we go.  Dummy female astronaut lets her tool bag go up into space.  That's her little...  I don't think it's up anymore when you're out there in space.  It's just out.  It's just...  I would call it just out.  It will end up plummeting through the atmosphere.  Great.  Hitting some idiot on the head.  Yeah, it'll probably burn up.  Someone's going to get hit with a putty gun from space.  I know it'll burn up, but I'm just going with the...  Oh, yeah.  What?  Oh, there it goes.  She's wiping something. 
[00:32:00]  What's she doing?  She's wiping the putty off of her hand.  Why don't she just take her glove off?  Would that be bad?  Her eyeballs just explode.  Oh, that would be bad?  Oh, boy, would it?  Really?  Yes.  For her, yes.  For us, no.  Great footage it would be.  I was thinking you'd just take off your...  What is it called?  Take the helmet off?  The helmet off and itch my eye because it got itchy.  Yeah, you get a little scrap.  Itch your eye as it flies out of your head.  And there goes the tool bag.  We'll have the video on onaradio.com. 
[00:32:30]  Look at her trying to get it.  Oh, she's...  She reached for it.  It's like, oh.  Oh, man.  Aren't those supposed to be tethered?  It should be.  You think?  You think it would.  Lost in space now has...  Lost in space!  Lost in space!  Lost in space!  Stupid media.  I've lost my young boy!  Get him back here!  Oh, dear!  How could this have happened?  I've dropped my young boy!  He's getting away!  Lost in space.  Wow, that's wonderful, guys. 
[00:33:00]  Working overtime in the newsroom, are you?  Aren't they funny?  Yeah.  Lost in space!  I had him...  I had a good, firm grip on him and he got away!  It wasn't even my hands.  I was able to work with my hands.  I had a firm grip on him with something else!  And something distracted me.  And I lost the grip.  Oh, dear!  Look, he's getting away!  Poor Dr. Smith. 
[00:33:30]  He popped off and flowed away, did he?  Yes, he popped off.  Poor, poor boy.  Dear boy!  Lost in space now has a brand new meaning this morning.  A spacewalking astronaut accidentally let go of her tool bag yesterday and the darn thing  just floated away.  She was out trying to clean a joint of the space station when a grease gun inside the  bag exploded.  Well, that'll scare me.  Wait a minute.  Joint, grease gun, exploded.  Cleaning a joint and a grease gun. 
[00:34:00]  We got it.  Yeah.  We got the potato flakes.  Potato flakes all over your space helmet.  Cleaning a thingy!  Oh, boy.  The gun inside the bag exploded.  Well, that'll scare you.  And NASA says they don't know exactly why the gun exploded or how the bag, which was tethered,  got away.  Wow.  How about an air bubble in there?  Wow.  In the vacuum of space?  Perhaps that'll make it explode.  How do you not, by the way, they're showing footage, and it's like you just, that thing is 
[00:34:30]  moving at 17,000 miles an hour.  With the tool bag.  The whole thing.  Everything.  The whole shmier.  That's why they're not getting, there's no air so they don't get sucked off like you  would if you were on top of a car roof.  But when you're looking down at the planet, how do you just not constantly panic?  I'm falling!  I'm not.  How do you not panic?  I guess you have to, that's probably question number one in astronaut school.  Will you panic if you look at the earth? 
[00:35:00]  No, not at all.  I'd like to, I'm fine.  All right, you're out.  Just stop shouting that.  Sorry, you're out of the program.  Yeah.  Well, you gotta be a man to begin with.  Well.  You know, like a real man, not what we are.  Chicks up there now.  Yeah.  Dropping their bags.  You think she was trying to do some kind of arts and crafts with her glue gun outside  the space shuttle?  She's making a collage.  A collage on the outside of the space shuttle because she was bored.  She's putting together a scrapbook. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  On the shuttle's tiles.  Scrapbooks.  Yuck.  Even better, she's cleaning the grouse like she should be in her shower at home.  You imagine, though, if she floated away like that?  Yeah.  Is there any plan to get you back?  No.  Well, they're tethered.  Yeah, they are tethered.  But what if the tether breaks?  Well, you're screwed.  Don't they have like little retro nitrogen rockets or something that they can zip around  with?  Oh, really?  Some directionals.  They have one shot at it.  Sean, North Carolina, how are you, buddy? 
[00:36:00]  I'm good.  How are you boys today?  Pretty good.  I know I feel bad if I let my wife take the trash out and these idiots are letting this  chick fix tile work outside.  What are they doing?  Watching the big game inside?  What's it feel?  Well, so you think the men are inside enjoying the big game and she's outside doing the heavy  lifting, right?  Yeah, they're watching the big game.  Hey, am I saying Sally?  Like, where'd she go off to?  I wear my tool bag.  You know, they're probably inside doing like the, ah, whatever. 
[00:36:30]  We were really trying to make something out of Sean's phone call.  A map reading joke and I couldn't come up with it.  Yeah, well.  It's kind of, even though she is a broad, she is an astronaut.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bitches floating.  So is that one that drove halfway across the country in diapers.  She was an astronaut too.  How good of a lay was that guy?  When you have a genius drive cross country and go to the bathroom on themselves to prevent  you from banging someone else, you are a tremendously good lay. 
[00:37:00]  Yes.  Absolutely.  Let's go to Buffalo.  John, how are you?  Pretty good, guys.  How are the bills doing?  Oh, not too well.  I wanted to go back a story, though, and I don't know if you guys know about it, but  there was a Gilligan's Island where the Harlem Globetrotters ended up on the island, which  I thought was pretty fair.  That's so funny.  I bet you they dribbled coconuts and threw them around, right?  And Gilligan got, and Bob Denver got nutty and something sped up.  And then Alan Hale grabbed his chest and fell into Marianne's crotch. 
[00:37:30]  I hated that show so much.  It never made me laugh once.  It was terrible.  How did they explain the Globetrotters getting on the island?  I don't know.  I didn't actually see it.  There's a couple of clips on YouTube, but I imagined the women there were in some peril.  Do we have a synopsis?  Yes.  The women were in peril?  I know what it was.  Thurston Howell was a cuck.  And Mrs. Howell would bring them on, and he'd be put on bull cleaning duty while all the 
[00:38:00]  Globetrotters serviced the lady in the house.  Of course.  Take care.  Bye.  All the tricks they could do.  Yeah.  They would all whistle to do, do, do, do, do, do.  You know?  While he was doing some prep work and some crap.  Yes.  Do you guys want to hear the synopsis?  Yes.  What's the synopsis of that episode because I want to know how they got on the island  and then more importantly, how they got off without the crew of the SS Minnow.  Well, the film, because it was a film. 
[00:38:30]  It was a film.  It was a sequel to the TV movie, The Castaways on Gilligan's Island.  Gilligan and his friends still-  What year are we looking at?  I don't know.  81.  81.  Only the best of movies were made in 81.  Oh, my God.  Gilligan and his friends still own and operate the vacation resort, The Castaways.  In the film, the Harlem Globetrotters, a traveling troop of merry basketball players-  Oh, Christ.  ...are on a plane ride over the Pacific Ocean when it has engine trouble and they are-  And crashes.  ...into an emergency landing onto Gilligan's Island.  It's lost. 
[00:39:00]  After a brief time struggling in the jungle, they are discovered by Gilligan and Skipper.  And welcome to The Castaways.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, a corporate raider has a plan to bamboozle the owners of The Castaways.  No.  Gilligan and his friends.  Into signing over ownership to him as the island contains ore, which provides large sources  of energy.  Oh, I thought they meant boating ores.  I'm like, can't they just make them?  They just-  They're natural that they hang on trees. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  They make boating ores.  Here's where it gets good.  And then, don't the Somalis show up and start cutting out Ginger and Marianne's personal  area?  Right.  It's funny.  Their genitals look like gutted houses in The Wire, season three.  Oh, nice.  They use post hole diggers.  Eventually, Gilligan and the Skipper uncover the conspiracy.  Ah.  And it results in a basketball game between the Globetrotters and the Doctors' robots. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, my.  Holy Jesus.  No.  How bad must the robots look?  Oh.  Like cardboard painted silver.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  The original script was going to be known as the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders on Gilligan's  Island, but was changed to have the Harlem Globetrotters star instead.  Why?  On the original series, the Howls and-  Because at the end, Ginger and Marianne, their purses stolen, and they figured that if  they had the cheerleaders do it, it wouldn't be as believable.  Idiotic show. 
[00:40:30]  Gilligan's Island meets the hat removers.  Yeah.  That was Mrs. Howl's hat they took off.  She comes out of her hut.  There's Curly.  Excuse me.  Gilligan's cuckled.  Curly's punching her hat off, and Meadowlark, and Geese Osby, the only two other names  I know.  Geese Osby.  And her force-feeding Marianne. 
[00:41:00]  Geese was the original, right?  Yeah, he was there.  It's all about the Harlem Globetrotters today.  You better reference this damn Harlem Globetrotter thing all morning long for us.  That sounds simply horrible.  Well, no, it gets better.  On the original series, the Howls are childless.  In fact, in one episode, they adopt Gilligan.  What?  That's just creepy.  Her womb is just so barren.  It's awful.  It's all old.  Went through menopause already.  They store their winter coats in it.  Yeah.  It's like the space bag you can order.  Yeah. 
[00:41:30]  That's all it's good for, storing your coats.  Of course it is.  Mr. Howl has to peek in there.  He's looking for his gloves.  Lovey, where's my gloves?  Despite this, a new character of Thurston Howell IV, the Howls' never previously mentioned son,  portrayed by David Mabamba, was there due to the ailing health of actor Jim Bacchus.  Oh, yeah.  Jim Bacchus is in some bad shape.  Who appeared only briefly in the movie's final scene.  Thurston Howell III was written out of the script by saying he was tending to business on the mainland. 
[00:42:00]  That's what they always say.  And ordered his son, Thurston Howell IV, to manage the island resort.  Although Bacchus was not in the cast, at his insistence to keep up the series canon, he made a cameo appearance at the end and is thus crazy, whatever.  But the son must have been exactly like Thurston.  Of course.  He probably had the same thing.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, so they could keep the character going.  Oh, that sounds horrible. 
[00:42:30]  That sounds like something I need to watch immediately.  Yes, Danny.  I would so watch this.  That sounds like something.  I want to see the robots.  I want to see the Harlem Globetrotters playing the robots.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll get some clips from this horrendous movie with the Harlem Globetrotters.  Also on the way, Jimmy's pal from Red Eyes getting trashed by that dope Barbara Walters.  Yeah, Greg Gutfeld.  And we are going to get into this because Jimmy has a whole chapter in his book, I Hate Your Guts, about the woman that made believe she was a man and got pregnant. 
[00:43:00]  Thomas Beattie, yeah.  It's a thing.  It's a thing.  It's a thing.  It's still a woman.  Oh, my God.  Look at these robots.  Oh, my God.  This is so bad.  The new Invincibles.  Oh, this is so bad.  Sherwood Schwartz, another worthless project by Sherwood Schwartz.  Why don't you knock on his multi-million dollar home in L.A. and tell him that.  Oscar winner Martin Landau was in this. 
[00:43:30]  Martin Landau was in this piece of garbage movie.  Barbara Bain, the husband and wife team.  Oh, the husband and wife team from Space 1999 and Mission Impossible.  I think he's the evil doctor.  Is he the evil doctor?  Yeah.  Martin Landau.  Who plays, what was the actor's name who played Jim Thurston Howell the Fourth?  Yeah, Thurston Howell the Fourth.  I couldn't pronounce his last name.  It's some nobody.  This was probably the only thing he ever did.  Oh, he's got to be.  We might have to do a little IMDb to see, but. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, fantastic.  There, okay.  Stu Nahan.  Watch Chick Hearn.  The L.A. Lakers announcer was in this.  George the Robot.  George the Robot.  This is the dumbest.  It's all about this movie now.  The New Invincibles.  Yes.  Thurston Howell the Fourth was David Ruprecht, who is on the HBO True Blood series.  We will be picking apart this movie for the next three months.  This is not a one-day thing.  Look at Jim Bacchus.  I know. 
[00:44:30]  Not looking too healthy there.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  So, the thing is pregnant again, Jimmy.  And I loved your chapter in the book about this.  Thank you.  We'll get into it after the break, because Barb Walters is going after your pal that does Fox.  So, we'll play that little clip, and we'll get into that.  Also, a woman falls for Nigerian email scam.  This is a great, great, great story.  Oh, Scott McGrath.  Oh, hopefully he suffers the same fate as the shiny.  Is anybody stranded? 
[00:45:00]  You like coconuts, Gilligan?  All right, listen.  We can get into this after the break.  We're late for a break.  Through a boogie in studio.  We've got Basil Teas cooking up the omelets today for us.  Hooper Avenue, Basil Teas Brew Pub and Italian Grill.  They do great stuff.  And we love Stephen Farley, the executive chef, who decided to come in once again today and cook for us personally.  You could have sent the lackey. 
[00:45:30]  You know that, right?  We wouldn't have cared.  But, you know, he's doing the job himself today.  Very cool.  Through a boogie will get us to break here.  Opiate it.  Let me see your war face.  You've got a war face.  A war face.  A war face.  A war face.  A war face.  That's a war face. 
[00:46:00]  That's a war face.  That's a war face.  You don't, you, you, you don't scare me.  You don't scare me.  Work on.  Right there, a person in Lifejack.  Do you see him?  It's a person stranded.  It's a person stranded. 
[00:46:30]  It's a person stranded.  Wow, Drew Boogie helping us out today.  Opie and Anthony.  One of these days, Drew will figure out how to make money off this great stuff.  Geraldo.  All right. 
[00:47:00]  Barbara Walters.  Yuck.  Yuck is right.  Yes.  I hope the women even say Barbara Walters, yuck.  It's easy to be a guy and say Barbara Walters, yuck.  I hope the women are smart enough to know that this broad stinks.  She interviewed the greats, I understand, but yuck.  She's going after our pal.  I've met him too, Greg from Red Eye.  He's a funny dude, man.  We've got to get him on the show.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  He should be on the show. 
[00:47:30]  He's got a late night show on Fox called Red Eye, and I've done it many times.  It airs from like three to four here on the East Coast.  On the West Coast, I think it airs at midnight.  Nice.  And they let you get away with a lot.  And these guys pretty much deal with every subject.  One of the things they were goofing on is Thomas Beattie.  Yeah.  I went to a taping with Jimmy, and I was amazed at what they got away with.  Yeah.  Because it's Fox.  We actually did.  Because it's Fox.  Yeah.  But they're actually better, I guess because of the late hour or two.  Right.  But it's done in O'Reilly's studio. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, they just kind of hose it down and change it a little bit.  And yeah, they pretty much let him do what he wants.  Could you like put a nice big booger on his chair next time you're there?  It's not.  His stuff is gone by the time we get in.  Of course it is.  I think they switch out the studio.  Take all of Bill O'Reilly's stuff out.  I think.  Doesn't want anyone touching it.  I think.  So, Thomas, what's his last name?  Beattie.  Why am I saying his?  Beattie.  Her.  That's common.  Let's you know.  Jimmy has a great chapter, and I hate your guts about this thing. 
[00:48:30]  What's the story?  You got a lesbian couple.  Wonderful.  Whatever.  Lesbian couple.  No problem there.  The Thomas Beattie takes out in the male role and had breasts removed to become a man,  but didn't really commit, had the ovaries left in.  Yeah.  Which is fine, but you're not a man.  Right.  Stop.  Stop, and didn't have a penis put on, kept the vagina and the ovaries.  Right.  Okay, terrific.  But you don't put on a little beard, and all of a sudden you're a guy.  Right.  And you know Thomas Beattie?  Because that would mean half the women in Old Westbury would be considered guys. 
[00:49:00]  That's a joke for everybody that has to ride the train on a Wednesday and see those Bettys  coming in for a Broadway show with their facial hair.  She looks like Mako from MASH, if anybody remembers Mako.  Mako.  Right.  And I applaud Jimmy, because in this book he destroys this guy, and the media for going  along with this, that it's an actual guy getting pregnant.  Because the media, and what they do is they love the juxtaposition of the words pregnant  man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just are tickled with the prospect of riding the pregnant man. 
[00:49:30]  And the fact these dummies are not just saying, look, this is a woman who takes on the male  role and had hormones or testosterone or whatever, but if you can stop taking testosterone shots  and then get knocked up, they did it with a turkey baster.  Right.  Fine, but you're not a man.  No, you're not.  You're a woman.  If you haven't had the plumbing taken out and a penis constructed, then stop saying  that.  But no one wants to acknowledge this. 
[00:50:00]  I think this thing was on Oprah, too, and Oprah was playing into it, which, you know,  come on, Oprah.  You're better than that.  So we go back in time a little bit.  Shave that beard, by the way.  Pardon me.  Shave that beard.  And it just looks like it's a woman who's flat-chested.  With short hair.  With short hair.  Yeah.  Anyone could grow the armpit hair.  Yeah.  You know?  So we go back a little bit.  This is how Red Eye handled the pregnant thing.  And then it leads to what Barbara Walters is doing yesterday or a couple days ago.  Isn't the fact that Beatty is pregnant, I could care less about what she does with her womb. 
[00:50:30]  What is outrageous is how the politically correct press is too scared to call he a she.  Doesn't that drive you nuts?  Yeah.  No, I totally agree.  It's absurd.  Pregnant man is an oxymoron.  It's like saying sober bill.  Yes, exactly.  It makes no sense.  There's a name for people with a uterus and a vagina, and it's woman.  Exactly.  Bravo to these guys, because I think they're the only media outlet that went with this.  Everyone else played into the pregnant man thing.  Yeah, it's not even close. 
[00:51:00]  No.  He's, um...  And they continually, I think, goofed on it.  And, of course, they got crap for us.  Yeah, we got a few more clips on it.  Why would they get crap for us?  Well, not from Fox.  From Barbara.  Yeah, but what could she possibly say?  Well, stick around and listen to the show, and we'll tell you.  A little tease.  Got to get that TSL up.  Right, boys?  They're listening in corporate.  It's all about TSL.  Shut up.  He's only six months into it. 
[00:51:30]  It's fine and well when you're only six months pregnant.  It's months seven, eight, and nine that you want to kill yourself, and I hope that that's  what happens to this guy.  I really do.  Well, I mean, what future is there for this child to go to, like, you know, out on events  with this creature who is her parent?  Oh, it's lifetime of therapy.  Hands down, a lifetime of therapy.  All right.  You think a lifetime of therapy?  Yes.  I think the problem I have with this couple is they're really into the media, you know, 
[00:52:00]  latching onto this.  Because now we're hearing that there's a second kid on the way.  Yes.  So they love the media attention.  This couple will have ten kids just so they can stay in the spotlight.  In the limelight.  In the limelight, right.  Why are you continually doing the Demi Moore photos?  Why are you doing all these things that draw attention to yourself if you just want to  go on?  Right.  At least be honest about what you want.  Right.  He's pregnant again.  They love saying that.  The thing is pregnant again.  Yeah.  So I'm asking you to write back to tell me how exactly is Thomas Beatty a man? 
[00:52:30]  Is it because she had her name changed to Tom?  Is it because she can grow a beard?  My aunt can grow a beard.  But she ain't no man.  Far from it.  Quite a lady, I might add.  Seriously.  Seriously.  Do we live in an age where someone can be a man just by saying they are?  Sorry.  I could say I'm a unicorn.  But that doesn't make me one, sadly.  Even after clapping three times and flicking a light switch on and off.  I'm still a man.  Daniel, you're just a wuss for failing to admit that dudes can't get pregnant. 
[00:53:00]  For that, you'd have to grow some cojones first, just like Thomas Beatty.  Great apology, boss.  Oh, okay.  That was obviously, there's a statement Greg does where he'll read a couple emails towards  the end of the show, and that was obviously a complaint email he was addressing.  Right.  I mean, any woman could look like a man.  He tried demanding an apology, and that was his nasty apology.  Look how well Travis did.  Look at him.  Travis Beatty.  Short hair.  Travis Beatty.  Short hair, a beard, and look. 
[00:53:30]  You wouldn't mistake him for a man.  Never.  And then Greg responds to demands for an apology.  So now people want him to apologize over this thing?  For what?  Why is it acceptable for you and your guests to totally disrespect and trash Thomas Beatty?  Don Imus got canned for his comments.  His were mild compared to the comments made on your show.  I hope an honest, on-air apology is forthcoming.  Mr. Cecilian, you expect an apology?  So here it goes.  I'm sorry you're a fat-faced cretin with sand for brains. 
[00:54:00]  Fact is, people like you saluting this misguided woman are hurting her more than helping.  After her 15 minutes are up, you can move on.  But she's still stuck with a confused baby, a terrible fashion sense, and a horribly manicured beard.  Right on, Greg.  Good for you, Greg.  You're smashing her.  Yeah, from red eye on Fox.  You should take a peek.  It's a pretty good show.  Yeah.  I mean, the 15-minute fame thing is never going to go away because they'll just keep having kids.  They'll get right back into the limelight. 
[00:54:30]  There'll be a reality show.  You watch.  Lifetime will pick this crap up.  Oh, yeah.  For the third, fourth, and fifth kid.  They're a lesbian couple.  Yeah.  Which is fine.  Judy Gold is part of a lesbian couple.  Who cares?  You know what I mean?  She's got kids that she gave birth to.  I don't know if she went through the same process.  It'd be interesting to ask her.  Well, lesbian couples do this all the time.  But, you know, to make believe you're a man when you're not a man, I don't understand the media. 
[00:55:00]  So Barbara Walters got involved.  Can't wait to hear her.  See, Barbara Walters is an irrelevant old lady.  Let's call her an old bag.  You're an irrelevant old bag.  I love that.  Old bag.  Anytime anything interesting starts happening, she'll jump in and just put a stop to it on that stupid show of hers.  That's why she got rid of it.  Look, I don't like Rosie.  I mean, I like her as a comic because she's ballsy and she doesn't care what people think of her.  I didn't like her political opinions, but you know what?  She was really interesting on that show. 
[00:55:30]  And, of course, Dumbbell, I guess, screwed it up.  But Rosie's not that brave, you know, because she should have came out of the closet while she had that hit show.  I do agree.  That's bravery right there.  Very easy after you make your money.  Well, she had to convince everybody that she was in love with Tom Cruise.  Wow.  Remember that?  All right.  So, and someone's asking, why isn't his, in quotes, thank you for doing that, James, his wife carrying the baby?  She had some kind of medical issue, right?  She had a miscarriage. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, I think she would have, but I think she couldn't.  She had, I think she has twins.  The thing has the safer womb, so they went with that.  Yeah, Beatty has the safer womb.  I think the girl, or the wife, woman number two, had, I think, a miscarriage or something because she had, whatever.  I think she has twins.  Right.  But she can't.  This is what Barbara Walter said recently about what Fox's red-eye show did.  Some people called you a freak.  A lot of people did.  20 years ago, this person would be traveling in a carnival. 
[00:56:30]  How does that feel, Barbara?  Carnival.  Of course, that's the example they raised.  But, you know, it's obviously a thing at Fox, too, because it was Fox.  You know, everybody knows how awful Fox is.  The other media's gut integrated, but Fox is terrible.  But you know what?  He speaks the truth.  Yeah, of course he does.  He's with sideshow crap.  And it's a comedy show.  Come see the pregnant man.  Yeah.  They make a lot of money on the circus circuit.  But Barbara Walter stinks so much, and she is the irrelevant old bag, because look at the self-righteous stance she's taken on a guy teasing Thomas Beatty. 
[00:57:00]  But she will not address herself and the rest of the media for the carnival freak show that it is.  Yeah.  She won't acknowledge that they love saying pregnant man.  They love it.  It's delicious.  Some people called you a freak.  A lot of people did.  20 years ago, this person would be traveling in a carnival.  This Fox News program called Red Eye was particularly troubling. 
[00:57:30]  So this little Ewok.  Why is it troubling?  Particularly troubling.  For being honest?  Yeah.  I guess it's troubling to be honest in the media.  Right, Barbara?  And then after this, we addressed it.  I think I was on a night or two after this, but this was the lead story that we did.  Nice.  He goes right back after it.  And I pointed out, I hate to toot my own horn, but what's troubling is the fact that you were banging a married senator.  Oh!  And that's...  That's troubling.  That's troubling.  And what she had to do is then she had to whore that out, that fact, just to get her book sold, just to get an interest in the book. 
[00:58:00]  Ooh, let's hear about the affair you had with the married guy.  Irrelevant old bag.  Shut up.  A news program called Red Eye was particularly troubling.  So this little Ewok that she's going to crap out might even have a third eye.  We do not know what this thing is going to look like.  It had this horrible piece on me.  People said that they wished I would die while giving birth, advocating my death and the death of...  I love these freak stories where they go out there and they expect everyone to handle it nicely. 
[00:58:30]  Yep.  Shut up.  No, you're going to catch some flack, dummy.  Of course you are.  And they didn't wish her death.  No.  The woman on the show was doing some joke about...  The woman that I had that night said to me about month seven, eight, nine, you're pregnant.  That's when you want to kill yourself.  And she said, I hope that's what happens with this.  You know, it was kind of a, you know, a hard-hitting joke, but it wasn't, I hope she dies for real.  It was a punchline.  It was humor. 
[00:59:00]  Too bad.  It was some of that black comedy.  Yeah.  Dark humor.  That dark stuff that people don't understand for some reason.  Is that her, Danny?  Wow, there's pictures of, uh...  That's how she, baby, before she was, uh...  Wow, why would you want to turn yourself into, like, a weird-looking dude when you look like that?  Yeah.  For real.  She was really attractive.  Holy ass.  We're mesmerized.  What happened?  She's beautiful.  Yeah, she was a pretty girl.  How would you ruin yourself like that?  You had the breast cut off. 
[00:59:30]  And not even go the distance.  Like, maybe if you went the distance, I would understand, but...  Yeah, if you had a mule put on.  Look how...  You gotta get that picture up on onaradio.com.  I've never seen that one.  Will do.  All right.  More Barbara Walters.  Said, um, that they wished I would die while giving birth, advocating my death and the death  of my child.  They did receive death threats.  Thousands of vile, hateful comments still littered the internet.  Um, and it makes me sick.  See, right after... 
[01:00:00]  You see what they do there?  Yeah.  Do you see what Barbara Walters, the journalist with integrity who apparently couldn't keep  her legs closed to the married guy?  Yeah.  Do you see what she does there?  Yeah.  Is they make it look like Fox or Gutfeld Show where advocating death threats and the  death of the child.  Yeah.  Nobody on Red Eye was doing that.  Yeah.  And that scummy journalism.  That scummy journalism.  The internet is full of hate.  What does that have to do with Red Eye?  But they put the clip of Beattie saying, uh, cause I'm sure people did want the child  dead.  And people did say stuff, I'm sure, on the internet like that. 
[01:00:30]  But no one on Red Eye said that.  No one.  And they juxtaposed it right after...  I use juxtaposition a lot.  I apologize.  But they put it right after that comment to make it look like that was Red Eye.  Stupid.  Explain that it was done in humor.  Maybe you didn't find it funny, but it wasn't a real...  Yeah.  A real statement about, uh...  Yeah.  As Jimmy nods.  I agree with you.  It's not a statement about...  I hate the media.  And then people go, well, you're part of the media.  Yeah, but the part that's...  But you're part of... 
[01:01:00]  Calling out the other part.  But I understand, cause you're...  Don't you guys...  What about me?  I don't understand, cause they're part of the...  Yeah, I guess we are part of the media.  But, but...  We like to point out this, this crap though.  It's, it's like a hobby for us.  I love the fact that the lead story that we did the other night was, was, uh, this pregnant, 
[01:01:30]  uh, man story.  He goes right back after us.  Could you do man in quotes, please?  Well, it's, it's...  No, no, I'm saying pregnant man, cause that's what they're calling it.  Well, now, now there's a second child, so that means more, uh, spotlight and limelight.  If you're so bothered by this...  Yeah.  Just go away.  Put yourself out of the public eye.  Yeah.  Just go away, and guess what?  It'll calm down.  But you'll be right, uh, back on TV.  You'll be back on...  Oprah doesn't need you anymore, by the way.  Oprah will not do a story on your second child.  On the pregnant man. 
[01:02:00]  No, she's done with that, cause she saw it as a freak show, she had her fun with it,  it got a little ratings, but she ain't, she knows there's no value in, in doing it all  over again for a second child, trust me.  The, uh...  She'll be doing, like, morning zoo interviews.  And they took the Fox clip, this is how phony that, that, that stupid piece of journalism  was.  The, the death threats on the internet are wanting the baby dead, like, for real.  I mean, that's, that's rough, to, to make real death threats where to really hope the  kid dies.  But because that was the only footage they had of anybody commenting negative, 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  You're right.  They used that, and then put the stuff, you know what I mean?  It was just such crap.  I don't care either way about the kid.  What I do care is this is being misrepresented.  That's what I care.  What else do they misrepresent out there in the media?  And why couldn't Barbara have written, and in his book, I Hate Your Guts, this comedian.  Right.  Why couldn't she have plugged the book?  Available now.  Yes.  Whatever books are sold.  Well, you know.  Including my crappy memoirs.  We do have, we have pests out there, and you know, they might have to bring it to Barbara's 
[01:03:00]  attention that there's a fine chapter on this whole thing, and I Hate Your Guts.  It's a great chapter.  I loved it.  Thank you.  I loved how you went after the media on this whole thing.  And I, but I'm also going after Thomas Beatty, because I, I, I find that the, the attention,  it's like, I don't mind that you want the attention, and you want that.  But then don't complain when there are some people that think you're an ass.  Right.  It's not going to be all positive.  Sorry.  You have to look at this one.  Daddy's got to go to the ladies' room at a ball game.  Imagine that.  Like the son, and a father and son go out to the, the game or something, and you got to 
[01:03:30]  go, oh, yeah, dad's got to go to the ladies' room to sit down and tinkle.  I don't know, man.  I, the sporting events I go to, they're not going to take kindly to this thing in the men's  room.  Standing up.  You got the iron workers.  Sitting on a urinal.  And you got the, uh, yeah, you got the union guys.  They're, they're not going to be understanding.  Trust me.  What the hell you call that, boy?  Trust me.  Hmm.  Ugh.  Well, good for Greg and Red Eye. 
[01:04:00]  It's a good show, Jimmy.  Wait, do they really, uh, I didn't know that.  Danny's pointed out, he said, why is it okay to show her bare nipples on TV and in the  paper while some stations blur out Peter Griffin's butt crack on Family Guy?  I didn't know they did show that.  Probably because, uh.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, because, you know what?  You're right, because it's probably because now it's a male chest and not female breasts.  Yeah, you're right.  Good point.  It doesn't matter.  Uh, there was, there was a guy, a man, who on a bet had breast implants put in, and they 
[01:04:30]  cubed that out.  Of course they did.  Because, but it's a guy with balloons under his skin.  Yeah.  But a woman with, so it's just the fatty part of the breast, the lump of the, the breast  that we like, we don't like the bulge?  Yeah, that must be it.  The part that swells out the sweater?  I don't know who makes those rules.  If the guy had the implants put in, like, his stomach, his stomach, to make him look  like he's got a double beer belly, they would show that.  Slowly push him up, and then where does it hit the line where they go, we can't show that 
[01:05:00]  anymore?  The second it hits nip, like, look, that's, that's the guy with the breast.  What a loser.  I think we talked to that loser.  He'd be so handy to have over the house, though.  That was great.  What a loser.  Just come here, dude.  Yeah, have a good TF and hand me that wrench.  What a complete ass.  But where is the line?  That's a good point.  Ah, look at that double stomach, double stomach.  Pull human out, those are breasts.  Right.  Yeah.  And you can't go any lower either.  Ah, look at that torso, double torso.  Too low, there's your testicles, block them. 
[01:05:30]  I mean, panics.  Unbelievable.  They do freak out.  All right, listen, there's a Google bomb being suggested.  Blue Healer from Kentucky, always good for a few.  I want to say hi to the ONA community in general that keep this show going on a regular  basis.  The ONA community.  Community.  Oh, that's a community, my friend.  That's nice.  Jim Norton, pregnant man, a little Google bomb today, Jimmy?  I would be fine, yes.  And that'll lead to I hate your guts.  Google bomb, Google bomb, I'm your Google bomb. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, Jim Norton, pregnant man, that's really great.  All right, let's do a Google bomb today.  Google Jim Norton, pregnant man.  And then on the way, when we get back, I would like to discuss what young Anthony was  just singing, because I was blown away.  Yeah, you're obsessed with Tom Jones and his new record.  Come on.  Stop.  We have him coming in, in December.  Just stop.  And I tell you, they gave us copies of the CD.  Yeah.  It's great.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe how good it was, Leslie. 
[01:06:30]  He's 68.  Is it?  And I'm toe-tapping.  He's just a guy.  I saw him at the Borgata.  Yeah.  Recently?  Live.  About maybe a couple of years ago.  How was he?  Fantastic.  Yeah.  He's a man.  Fantastic.  He's a performer.  He's a performer.  But he's in one of those categories where you should never listen to the new music.  You just should go back and listen to the old music.  It's great, the new song.  I'm Alive.  I'm Alive.  The new song, I'm Alive, rules.  But you could listen to What's Up, Pussycat?  What's New, Pussycat? 
[01:07:00]  Oh, What's Up, Pussycat?  What's Up, Pussycat?  Meow.  It's the wrong song.  What's New, Pussycat?  There are artists that continue putting out music.  I'm not saying Tom Jones is in this category, because now it's leading to something.  That you should never listen to their new stuff.  Just always go back and listen to their old stuff.  And then there's other artists, like U2, continues to put out new stuff that people really, really enjoy and should listen to.  You know what I mean?  Like Journey has new stuff out, I guess.  I guess. 
[01:07:30]  Yes.  But that's one of those bands you should just always go back to the old stuff and just blow off anything they attempt that's new.  Yep.  Right?  What other bands?  Kiss?  Kiss?  Yeah.  Kiss would just be go back to the old stuff catalog.  What other bands we got?  Yeah.  They listen pretty good.  Fog, huh?  All right.  We're going to talk to Jimmy about his Tom Jones obsession after the break.  The new song's called I'm Alive.  I love it.  Do you?  Dude, it was great. 
[01:08:00]  What do you got, Iraq?  Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island.  Oh, some clips?  Guess what?  Screw Tom Jones.  Yikes.  We're doing this after the break.  Oh, I just got a douchey chill.  Yeah.  I felt it.  I know what's coming on this.  We can't do both, Jimmy, because we want to keep the listeners tuned in.  I'm a man.  Are you?  Yeah.  You bet you are, Tom.  Tom Jones.  All band.  A hundred percent, pal.  He says that in the song.  The new one?  Yes.  I'm a man. 
[01:08:30]  And it's like, you're goddamn right, Tom.  You sure are.  You bet you you are.  Who would doubt that?  I wouldn't.  Love Tom Jones.  You understand?  He probably had to duck because of balled up panties being thrown at him.  Yes, he did.  Every chick wants to bang Tom Jones.  And you think it's only the old broads coming up and throwing the panties at him?  No.  I saw him, and they were all broads, and they were throwing big bloomers at him.  Sure.  But then these, like, hot young chicks are running up the aisle with little thongs, just 
[01:09:00]  throwing them at Tom.  Because it's the thing to do.  Yeah, exactly.  That comes down, and none of these broads want to bang Tom Jones.  How do you get to the point where it's the thing to do?  Exactly.  I'm on stage, and they yell, frunkus, because it's the thing to do.  Yeah.  How about panties?  But Tom sees the young broads come to the stage with their panties, gets all excited,  gives them passes for backstage.  They're not showing up, but the old broads with the bloomers sure are.  Yeah.  Well, they're sticking.  Sex bomb.  They're showing up for Tom, believe me.  No one says no to Tom. 
[01:09:30]  No.  Take your panties off, you lesbians.  We got an ARR update after the break, too.  Oh.  An ARR.  ARR.  We got your pirate update, if you were listening earlier.  It's your exclusive pirate team coverage here.  That's right.  The Somalians.  Did they get away with this one?  Ah.  That's the question I asked as we go to break with Drew Boogie.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:10:00]  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  Stop showing this, for goodness sake.  We don't need to see this anymore, thank you.  Stop showing this, for goodness sake. 
[01:10:30]  We don't need to see this anymore, thank you.  We don't need to see this anymore, thank you. 
[01:11:00]  What's the fight?  What's the fight?  What's the fight?  Ladies and gentlemen, put them together for Spud.  Stop, okay?  Good night.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Opie and Anthony.  That was fantastic.  Damn good.  I know Drew's always looking for something to work off for another remix.  Here's one for you.  F you, Drew Boogie.  Work with that one, okay?  Thank you.  F you, Drew Boogie. 
[01:11:30]  Thank you.  877-212-ON-A.  We got your pirate update, and then we're going to move into Harlem Globetrotters on Gildigan's Island.  Because we're fascinated with the subject.  We can't think of anything but...  No.  And can we bow to basil teas today?  You outdid yourself today, my friend.  Fantastic.  The steak I'm eating right now is ridiculous.  F-ing ridiculous.  And some, like, exotic mushroom in the egg white omelet.  What is that? 
[01:12:00]  That's like heaven on earth, my friend.  Onion.  Onion?  It's basil teas, Hooper Avenue, Tom's River.  Hooper.  We got Stephen Farley, the executive chef.  I use it for my personal party needs.  Yeah, he does a good job.  He caters to all my parties.  Apparently he can sprinkle Rohypnol into the food.  Goddamn, Tim.  Is there alcohol in everything when you cook for Anthony? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  It's got to be scotch and just everything has some kind of...  More wine!  They're eggs.  My family, they rave about basil teas.  They rave about the food.  It's just amazing.  Yep.  Really good.  All right, your pirate update.  All right, Arr.  Arr.  Got the Somalians taking over the, what, the big ships.  Yeah, the oil ships.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Mostly oil ships, right?  They didn't know what it was.  They thought it was a Willy Wonka transport.  They all love chocolate.  Yeah.  They're all drinking the oil.  Doesn't taste as good.  We sound Jamaican because Jim's a one Caribbean voice.  India.  This is your pirate update.  Your Arr update.  India is reporting that the pirates' mothership, that's the name of the ship?  It's called mothership?  Okay.  India is reporting that the pirates' mothership has been destroyed. 
[01:13:30]  Oh.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Zoinks.  What happened?  Well, an Indian naval, an Indian naval?  Indian, the Indian Navy?  What the hell's going on in this world?  Let me tell you something about India.  They don't play games.  No.  No.  There's a lot of them, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, political correctness hasn't taken over that country.  No.  They just know what to do.  Yes, my friend.  Who are they always fighting it out with? 
[01:14:00]  Pakistan.  Pakistan.  Oh, they hate each other.  They hate each other.  Those two countries.  They both got nukes.  Yeah, those two countries will end the world.  Yeah.  You know that, right?  Hopefully, we're not around for it.  So, India figured they'd lob a shell at the mothership?  Well, an Indian naval warship confronted the pirates, demanded they stop for inspection.  Uh-oh.  Pirates said, F you.  Good move.  Threatened?  Threatened.  I know.  You wrote threaded.  Threatened the Indians, and they fired an RPG? 
[01:14:30]  The Somalians fired an RPG at the Indian naval ship, right?  Good move.  Apparently, the Indians said that the deck of the ship was filled with pirates who were  all carrying RPGs and just waving them at them.  Oh, that's great.  And one of them fired a shot across the bow.  Yeah.  What are they thinking?  They are the dumbest pirates.  They've been getting away with some stuff, though.  One too many French yachts.  What do you think, though? 
[01:15:00]  Like, you got a warship, albeit an Indian one.  I don't know much about their navy.  But it's got to be better equipped than their ship full of RPGs.  A boat with a big red circle in front of us.  Yeah.  Target.  So the pirates made the big mistake of firing their RPG.  India returned fire.  Yeah.  The pirate ship was left in flames.  Of course it was.  I wonder if an RPG was really fired.  Yeah, right.  The Indians confronted them and went, you got to go.  Yeah, they fired an RPG over the bow. 
[01:15:30]  You'll never find it.  They were waving RPGs.  Yeah.  All of them with white flags tied to them.  They didn't know what that meant, so.  All right, so we got an update on that.  Dude, you can't hijack a hundred million dollars worth of oil and not have somebody go, all  right, you need to be stopped.  Someone's going to miss that.  Eighteen ships from every country.  Yeah.  No one's going to fault you now.  Target one country.  Yeah, right.  Don't target everyone because it's whoever sinks you. 
[01:16:00]  Then it's their problem.  Yeah.  Well, the Indians decided.  Did the Indians have a ship that was being held hostage, or did they just come across  this pirate?  Arr.  Arr.  I don't think the Indians had one, but good for them.  Hong Kong, Saudi, Japan, Philippines.  Nope.  Philippines.  Nothing in the current list.  Wow.  But it was in their neighborhood.  All right, let's get into some Harlem Globetrotters.  Oh, please.  This is for the people that were with us early. 
[01:16:30]  That's right.  We're obsessed with the Harlem Globetrotters.  We found out they were on Gilligan's Island in a movie that no one saw.  The worst combination you could possibly put together, Gilligan's Island and the Globetrotters.  With robots playing basketball.  With robots, an evil scientist who created robots to play the Globetrotters in basketball.  Yeah.  Who thought that of?  That Sherwood Schwartz stinks.  Well, he absolutely is horrendous. 
[01:17:00]  Just the worst shows.  What a schlocky dope.  And we got the video up on O&A radio?  Yep.  Because the Globetrotters play the robots?  Got to see how the robots look.  Makes a show where America's dads are queer.  What was he thinking?  Oh, boy.  We got a Bijou on the line. 
[01:17:30]  Bijou.  Bijou.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hello, my friend.  Wait, did we pronounce your name correctly?  Yes, you do, sir.  Bijou.  Bijou, yeah.  Hey.  Listen, my uncle's in the Indian Army for 25 years, and those guys have the best freaking  thing.  With the Navy, because the Indian Ocean is right there.  These guys will blow you up for no reason at all.  Well, I don't think they have the best Navy.  I think the United States has the best Navy. 
[01:18:00]  For a third world country, they have the best Navy.  Oh, for a third world country.  The drop-off's pretty big.  You know what?  India probably hasn't had a good naval conflict in a while.  They're like, look, just let us out there.  We'll take care of it.  Yeah.  We'll deal with it.  We'll take care of it.  They'll bomb the crap out of Pakistan any day.  I know you will.  See, this is...  They have the nuclear weapons, and they have...  That's it, man.  They don't mess around when it comes to stealing their stuff, man.  Hey, where is it they're always fighting?  What's it called?  Catman Dew.  Cashmere, right.  Cashmere. 
[01:18:30]  What about Cashmere?  Cashmere.  Yes.  Oh, Cat Stevens.  Cashmere.  Cashmere.  You know what I don't understand?  It's been fighting with Cashmere and Pakistan together at the same time.  You know what I mean?  Do you realize, to the rest of the world, you look like the same people?  I know, man.  You know, Guyanese, Trinati, and we all look alike, but...  Yeah.  Like Hindus?  I'm Hindu.  You know what I mean?  And we don't play no games, man.  No.  All right, I've rebooted my computer, and now what?  It's like a lot.  Ten years ago. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, you're funny.  I didn't even get that.  I don't want to have that tab, my buddy, okay?  All right.  I'll just take the joke in with you.  That's a good line.  I know.  All right.  I know.  See you, man.  I know.  Yeah, you guys are great, man.  All right.  Thanks, Bijou.  Dude, I didn't even get that.  I look forward to waking up.  I wake up in the morning just to listen to you backwards.  All right.  Thank you.  Yes, my friend.  Bijou.  That was funny.  Dude, I didn't even get it.  I'm like, why would he mention that?  Oh, he's brilliant.  Yeah.  Let's do Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island.  Now it starts with the plane having problems, and of course, they've got to land the plane. 
[01:19:30]  How do they do that?  And it ends up on Gilligan's Island, but here's the plane still in the air.  They're flying him.  Uh-oh.  I don't like that new tune.  I'm scared.  My head's sticking straight up.  And so is mine.  What's happening, man?  Dewey is a good coach and a good pilot.  Right now, I wish he was a coach instead of a pilot.  We're in the middle of a six-year-old, and I can't even swim. 
[01:20:00]  Stand by, Jaws 1 and Jaws 2, and get ready, Jaws 3.  Keep calm.  This is no time to panic.  It may be our only time, man.  I don't know how to react to that.  We can't play anymore.  They're good actors.  It is so bad, we can't play anymore.  We have to.  No, no.  No, Jimmy.  Dewey's a good coach.  No.  The worst acting I've ever heard in my life, ever. 
[01:20:30]  Dewey, coach.  Coach Dewey.  That could be worse than Voss.  That's so funny.  We compare Voss to the Globetrotters in the 81 Gilligan's Island movie.  Right.  Louis Beans is flying the plane.  Wow.  We, uh...  And the laugh track is horrendous.  Yeah.  I mean, of course there's got to be a laugh track in there.  Because Sherwood Schwartz never put out anything of quality.  He put out nothing but garbage.  Crap.  They're sleeping on their basketballs, using them as pillows. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, look.  They're all using them as pillows.  That is fantastic.  Look at that.  And they're in the plane.  All right.  We'll do another one.  We got the good news, bad news clip.  Oh, I got good news and bad news.  There we go.  Okay.  All right.  Armed Globetrotters.  Oh, let me strap in again.  On Gilligan's Island.  This is terrible.  I just saw Doey.  I got some good news and some bad news.  But what's the good news?  The good news...  We're great basketball players.  The bad news, they're filming this. 
[01:21:30]  I just saw Doey.  I got some good news and some bad news.  The good news is, we're the Harlem Globetrotters.  The bad news is, we're all...  Of course you have to go there.  Of course.  Everyone was thinking it, but you had to say it.  Of course you had to.  It's in your blood.  I just saw Doey.  I got some good news and some bad news. 
[01:22:00]  Anyone?  Anyone?  Anyone want to volunteer?  Anyone?  The good news is, we're still working.  The bad news is, we won't be if we keep stopping that tape.  I just saw Doey.  I got some good news and some bad news.  Well, what's the good news?  The good news is, Doey's fixing the engine.  There's no problem.  Well, what's the bad news?  Well, the bad news is, I just made up the good news.  Something's wrong with the electrical system. 
[01:22:30]  He can't even radio for help.  They're so incredibly bad.  Look how big this plane is, because these guys are all like seven foot.  And they're in, by the way, it's a movie set airline seats on a private plane.  Can you go back?  Yeah.  Look at, there's probably two inches of room between their seats.  It's to get them all in frame.  Yeah.  They have like three globetrotters sitting in seats one, two, and three in front of each 
[01:23:00]  other.  And there's literally, to get them all in frame, three inches of room between seats.  These guys are six foot 11 each.  Yeah.  It's horrendous.  Do you know who Doey is in this fine movie?  Scatman Crothers?  Bing, bing.  Oh.  Ben?  Ben?  What's happening?  Hey, do it.  Can you fix it?  Nope.  But I did put it on automatic pilot.  And I want you fellas to know what I'm doing.  Yeah, look at the scarf.  I'm doing everything I can.  Maybe we'll get a snowcat. 
[01:23:30]  I gotta call Larry Durker as we're crashing into the ocean.  Larry Durker.  Gotta suck to be an actor.  He's in The Shining and now, right around the same time, right?  Right around the same time, yeah.  He's doing this crap.  I'm a automatic pilot, and I want you fellas to know that I'm doing everything I can.  How's our chances?  Well, I took advantage of the tailwind.  I tried heading due north.  I tried heading due west. 
[01:24:00]  Which way are we heading now?  Due down.  Due down.  That sounds real serious.  The alleged jokes are so bad and delivered so horribly.  But due down.  What are these jokes?  Do-do.  Sherwood Schwartz.  Hope he has gout.  I think he's dead.  Is he?  I think he just recently died, didn't he?  Who knows? 
[01:24:30]  I think Sherwood Schwartz died like maybe a few months ago.  Hope it was slow.  Look at how wide the aisle of the plane is.  I'm saying, this plane's got to be humongous.  He could do some soft shoe.  They have no room in between the seats, but if you want to sleep in the aisle, you can.  Yeah.  After delivering those lines, now I know why they call him Scat Man.  Jesus.  And finally, one more clip for now. 
[01:25:00]  We're trying to find more.  Oh, please.  Headed to due down, we're going to get due wet.  I knew we should have taken a train.  Nah, be cool, fella.  Nothing's going to be all right because I found a tiny little island on the map, and that's  where we're heading.  And if we can make it there, I can land the plane.  What if we can't reach it?  Yeah, what if we can't make it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What kind of plane is that?  From the outside, it doesn't look like the inside. 
[01:25:30]  Of course not.  Oh, it's a Cessna Huge Isle.  The Cessna Huge Isle, they were never popular.  That's the Huge Isle.  Because it was all aisle, and then they had the seats, but they said anything more than  a quarter inch in between them just won't do.  God.  Oh, fantastic.  Yeah.  I'm stunned at the horrificness of that.  Where's the audience sitting?  On the wing?  Yeah, there's like laughter. 
[01:26:00]  Where were they?  I don't know.  Apparently not watching this.  Poor Scatman.  Sherwood is still alive?  Really?  How old?  He was born in 1916.  Five bombs and he's still alive.  92.  I could have sworn he died recently.  Well, sorry, Sherwood.  It was just your creativity that died sometime in the 60s, apparently.  Did he ever do anything worth note?  Did he ever make anything that was any good?  It'd be funny if he produced Citizen Kane and then did the Brady Punch and Gilligan's 
[01:26:30]  Island.  One masterpiece.  From here to eternity and Gilligan's Island.  All right.  We got a break.  I'm a man.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into your Tom Jones obsession next, Jimmy.  You just calm down over there.  I'm Alive is the new single and you listen to it already.  You'll love it.  The whole CD rules.  Does it?  Does.  All right.  We'll find out.  We're going to do a little FU stuff first, Drew. 
[01:27:00]  Going to go to the FU line and then we got Drew Boogie in studio today playing this out  as Basil Tease makes the omelets in the background.  Lots going on today.  But first, the FU line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.

[01:27:30]  Next message.  Hey, this FU is to Patrice O'Neal, man.  I'm listening to you when Anthony wasn't in on Monday.  Dude, shut the f*** up, man.  You guys just b*** about everything.  You guys want apologies, but it's not good enough.  You want this, you want that.  You shut the f*** up.  Take care of yourselves, man.  Ride yourself up out of the city.  Peace.  Next message.  I want to give a big FU to the stupid hippies of f***ing tribes that came up here and destroyed  my place in Wyoming.  I hate you, hippies. 
[01:28:00]  Next message.  Hey, Marcel, you alcoholic piece of dog f***.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, this big FU goes out to Danny from f***ing your fat piece of f***ing.

Yeah, I'd like to say a big f***ing to all the Mets fans in the world.  John Rocker was right.  F*** you.  End of new messages. 
[01:28:30]  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU line 1.  That's 866-FU line 1.  Thank you and goodbye.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink at the table.  B***h!  Mike!  Mike!  You don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a man like Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Green!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe! 
[01:29:00]  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe!  Moe! 
[01:29:30]  Moe!  We'll be right back. 
[01:30:00]  It's a little different on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Today, yes, it's Drew Boogie Day.  Comes in and does all those great mixes live.  Live.  We're not pushing a play button.  In studio doing that on the fly, which is very, very cool.  Good morning to Boston.  Celtics beat my knickerbockers.  And I always have a problem with his name, but, you know, Boston's got the AL MVP.  Dustin Pedroia.  Yeah.  Right?  That's how you say it?  Yep.  The amazing thing about him, he won, what, Rookie of the Year last year, and now he's 
[01:30:30]  AL MVP the next year?  That's pretty impressive.  That's pretty impressive.  Pretty impressive.  And enjoy LeBron James Cleveland, because this is it.  You know that.  Everyone knows it.  Why?  He's a free agent, Anthony.  What does that mean now?  He is not going to be staying in Cleveland.  No?  Hell no.  Where's he going?  Although, they have a shot, right?  Because Cleveland could, you know, offer the most.  Yeah.  Right?  That's how that works in the NBA? 
[01:31:00]  Yep.  Ah, they're hinting that the, what, the Nets are going to get him?  Why wouldn't he stay in Cleveland?  Five higher profile cities.  Huh?  I don't think it's that Cleveland stinks.  When you're an athlete, you want to be, like Jimmy said, in a high-profile city, like  L.A., Chicago, a little New York action wouldn't hurt his career.  The Nets will be in New York, too.  The Brooklyn Nets.  Right.  I think Jay-Z bought the Nets, right?  He's one of the colors.  Yeah, and he's friends with Jay-Z.  Yeah.  I bet you.  He's been downplaying that a lot, which means it's probably a done deal. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Yep.  But he's having a hell of a year.  These guys, when their contracts are up, they know how to rock.  Yeah.  He's just destroying the league this year.  I mean, he's a great player, but he's even better this year.  And the youngest player to 11,000 points, beating out Kobe Bryant by well over a year.  A year in, I want to call it like a year and three months, something like that.  Yeah, but he started in the NBA when he was 13.  Wow.  He's a good point.  18, Jimmy, I think.  18, maybe 19.  All I care about is Abdul-Jabbar's record, which Jordan would have broken but retired. 
[01:32:00]  I want no one to break Abdul-Jabbar's record.  Yeah.  Yeah?  No one.  Which one's that?  Most points in NBA history.  Oh, yeah?  How many?  A lot?  40.  That's more than us.  It's 30-something thousand, I think it is.  Is it up that high?  Wow.  Yes.  Wow.  The sky hook.  That's a lot of perints.  And can I answer a question that you were asking me during the break?  We were talking in the break, and I'm about the Red Eye thing.  And Hope goes, what the hell with Red Eye?  Where are you going to be soon?  Because I want to come see it.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Something about that. 
[01:32:30]  Wait, I said that?  Yes.  Remember we were talking?  When?  Because I said, I have to get on a plane today, and you're like, where are you going?  I want to come see you.  And I'm like, now we've got things to do.  I thought you said I've got to get on a plane, Spider.  Oh.  Yeah.  Crawl.  Like you're Crawford, the Schwartz script on the plane.  I know that's why we brought in Steve to do the armaments and Drew Boogie to do the  remixes, because you've got the big Atlantic Vegas gig.  I'm doing a Friday night thing.  I don't know that.  Caesar's Palace, Friday night, Augustus Ballroom, 7 p.m. 
[01:33:00]  And the Borgata, January 16th, 17th.  I'm properly celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday weekend with special tributes  to Dr. King during my show.  Really?  Yes.  How are you going to do that, Jimmy?  I can't wait to see that.  How are you going to do it?  Is it a surprise?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which cast of Seinfeld member I'll bring out?  Can you imagine?  Here he is.  For the first time in a long time.  You might remember him as the lovable character. 
[01:33:30]  You would love to pull that one off, too.  Nah, I'll get you shot.  You think?  Nah, I'm not part of the thing.  That's a bad one.  That's a bad one.  Unless it's Elaine, and he'd like the Globetrotters teabagger.  Boy, did he just disappear from the face of the earth, huh?  He's laying low for a couple of years.  I mean, no one will hire him.  He's laying low for a couple of years.  How about a decade or two?  It's like Michael Corleone going to Sicily.  He just dropped off the face of the earth.  Hey, look, too bad.  Look, Michael Richards has Kramer money.  He's set for life.  Yeah.  So, you know, whatever project he'll work on, he'll have to go through his comeback. 
[01:34:00]  He'll be fine.  He'll come back.  All right.  I was just pondering that.  Seeing how he would come back.  That would be a tough order.  We've all gotten the Nigerian email, right, at this point?  Yeah, I'm still waiting for my money.  God.  Well, a woman.  Forever.  A woman fell for this damn thing.  Who's who?  A woman fell for this.  How old is she?  I don't know.  We're going to find out.  But she retarded. 
[01:34:30]  Danny says this is great stuff.  Woman falls for the Nigerian email scam.  We've all had that in our inbox, and it's such a joke.  Yeah.  You know.  You don't even acknowledge it.  Some lawyer, some barrister sends you an email.  Yeah.  Says you've been selected to look after this money.  Please help me ship it out of the country, because there's a big problem here.  You know, people want to take it, but I can't get it out.  So I need your help.  And for that, you'll get like 10 mil.  It's like $100 million.  But, you know, you're going to have to help me. 
[01:35:00]  And in order to help, they ask you to send over, like, fees in good faith.  You know, send me $1,000.  I need $10,000 to bribe this guy and that one.  It's so close.  You're going to get the money any day now, but we just need a little more money.  I apologize for that.  That's how the scam works.  And people just keep sending money over there.  It's unbelievable.  Well, listen to this.  It started, as it almost always does, with an email.  I'm here as an official assignment with President Bush and the FBI director, Mr. Robert Mueller. 
[01:35:30]  Promising $20 million.  The money supposedly left behind by a relative of Janela Spears, with whom the family had lost contact over the years.  So that's what got me to believe it.  Janela didn't know how the center knew the name of J.B. Spears, but her curiosity was piqued.  They said, this is your account number.  You have $150,000 that you can get out of this account if you pay me $100.  Okay, so why wouldn't you send over $100?  She received phony certificates from the Bank of Nigeria, promising irrevocable payment guarantees of $12 million. 
[01:36:00]  A letter from a U.N. spokesman on U.N. letterhead, no less, saying $26.6 million would be transferred within five minutes into her Washington Mutual account, but only if she paid the $8,300 fee.  Note the misspelling of minutes.  Really?  You're a dummy.  You're a dummy.  How old is she?  How old is the old deer? 
[01:36:30]  She doesn't sound that old.  The old deer.  My nest egg.  I know the elderly will fall for this crap a lot, but...  They certainly do.  I feel bad for them only because they're really lonely, and a lot of them open mail.  They actually go through the junk mail because it's like a thing for them.  I read something in the Times one time about one of these old guys, and his whole family is...  I just wanted to cry, and very rarely do I not just want to push an old person into a china cabinet.  Remove their hat.  But I felt so bad for the old guy.  He's like just so alone.  He wants to fill these out and talk to people. 
[01:37:00]  He just wants to believe, right?  He's lonely.  Good.  Anybody under the age of 80...  All my friends are dead.  All right.  Make some new Nigerian friends, you dummy.  You lummox.  Send over all your money.  He's lonely.  Well, this particular person got letters from the president of Nigeria.  Who would that be, by the way? 
[01:37:30]  Why would he send letters to an old person in the U.S.?  Yeah.  And?  President Bush himself.  President Bush.  Yes.  What did he have to do with this?  When Spears actually began to doubt the validity of the scam, she promptly received letters from the president of Nigeria, FBI Director Robert Mueller, and President George W. Bush.  Robert Mueller writes, the transaction you have with the Central Bank of Nigeria, or any bank within Nigeria, is noting but legal.  President Bush tells her an even more elaborate story about a terrorist apprehended at the Harthrow Airport in New England. 
[01:38:00]  Boy, these Nigerians can't spell.  How about spell checking?  How mighty.  Harthrow Airport.  I flew into Harthrow.  Damn it.  Harthrow Airport.  Where is that?  He's a stupid Nigerian.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, and even a dumber friggin' woman.  Yeah, at least the Nigerians has the language barrier, she should know better. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Come on.  Jesus.  Want to hear more of that?  At the Harthrow Airport in England, with funds valued at $12 million, as he attempted to launder funds to Iran for, capital T, terrorist activities.  Wow.  The messages, by the way, are from email addresses like USAWhiteHouse at MyWay.com.  And FBI underscore investigates2007 at Yahoo.com. 
[01:39:00]  The FBI is using Yahoo.  The FBI are secure Yahoo emails.  Holy jeez.  What a dummy.  Dot com.  And FBI underscore investigates2007 at Yahoo.com.  I said, how come you're using this non-government address?  Oh, because our computer has a worm.  Our computer has a worm.  The computer, the children, everything has a worm over there. 
[01:39:30]  Our apples.  Our apples have a worm.  Our computer has got flies on it.  God.  You want to hear more?  Of course.  She was at this for two and a half years, it looks like.  Right out of the gate, the scammers got $20,000 from Spears.  Over two and a half years, they bilked her for amounts ranging as low as $50 and as high as $14,000. 
[01:40:00]  It all added up to $400,000.  You kept believing them because they kept telling you that this was the last step.  This is going to be the end.  Right.  This is the last step.  This is going to be the end.  Spears had never thought of herself as foolish.  She is a registered nurse.  She teaches CPR and she's a reverend.  Is it great that blinded her?  Yeah, I think it was.  Just the idea that she was going to be, you know, a multimillionaire.  This undercover investigator with the Oregon Department of Justice who worked the case 
[01:40:30]  says Spears is the worst case he's seen.  Often, he says, victims become obsessed, ignoring all the warning signs.  There was a lot of people that told her.  The FBI agents told her.  The local authorities in Sweet Home told her.  I told her.  The bank investigators told her.  Everybody told her.  She deserves it.  And she just kept doing it.  God told her.  I mean, what?  She deserves it.  Of course she does.  She deserves to be ripped off.  I'm looking at her face.  She is older.  She looks like Kathy Bates in Misery.  Yeah.  She's like a fat-faced old dope. 
[01:41:00]  She's not that old, Jimmy.  You know what I mean?  She's just a dummy.  They're just a bunch of Spears shuckers.  Wow.  What?  Boo.  Ah, boo.  No way.  That was a damn good one.  And punt.  Of course.  Do the bit.  Yeah, we're doing the bit.  Don't you worry.  Do the bit.  We're doing the bit.  Don't you worry.  I was on stage and I heard someone going. 
[01:41:30]  I'm like, what are they yelling?  Do the bit.  That's what they were yelling.  What are they yelling?  Do the bit.  What a jackass.  Yes.  So.  That's right, Poe.  Yuck.  That's right, Master Poe.  So, everybody told her and she still did it.  And she spent $400,000. 
[01:42:00]  How does she have so much money as a nurse?  Yeah.  Who does she take care of?  The Rockefellers?  400 G's.  Danny, you have any answer?  Over two and a half years.  That question gets answered in, I think, the last question.  Oh.  More sound.  She didn't have that much money.  Oh, no.  To give these nice stories.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Hopefully, she's a bag lady.  What kind of porn she likes.  Spears has a husband who can't even hide his anger.  He tells us he gave up a long time ago trying to convince his wife this was a scam. 
[01:42:30]  She spent two years' worth of her own salary, borrowed against their home and car, which  had been paid off, and drained his retirement fund.  Oh, my God.  How does she live?  How do you not hate?  How does she live?  How is she alive?  How does this husband not kill her?  What a dummy.  Wow.  God almighty.  And everyone was telling her.  Everybody.  Including the, what, the FBI?  The FBI told her, and she's continued. 
[01:43:00]  And the husband didn't just punch her in the face.  Oh, my God.  And car, which had been paid off, and drained his retirement fund.  He's not comfortable because the retirement that he was dreaming of, of cruising and going  around and seeing America, is pretty well gone for him right now.  As Spears tries to pick up the pieces of what's left, she's sharing her story in the  hope she can help someone else avoid the same mistake.  The hope is that they're not going to fall as hard as I feel. 
[01:43:30]  Spears estimates it will take her at least three or four years to dig out of the debt  that she created with this Nigerian scam.  What a selfish, pig-ish woman.  Oh.  Unbelievable.  Wow.  Dumb.  Wow.  Everyone told her.  The FBI told her.  And she couldn't, this is, that, to me, she's a sociopath.  Because she couldn't acknowledge how stupid she was.  No.  Kept trying.  And the husband's an idiot.  Yeah.  The husband's an idiot. 
[01:44:00]  Take the computer away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smash her computer and put the bank account in your own name.  Whoa.  Well, let's say hi to Nick in New Orleans.  Nick, how are you, buddy?  Oh, doing good.  What a dumb broad.  Yeah.  Look, my grandmother, I work up in New York during the summer.  I teach, you know, during the school year, work up in New York during the summer.  Yeah, I got a radio show. 
[01:44:30]  Little Ronnie tribute.  Go ahead.  My grandmother got a call from, she just picked up the phone and the guy said, hey.  And she's like, Nick.  And he's like, yeah, I'm up in Canada.  I got arrested for fishing.  I caught an illegal fish and I need two grand to get out of jail.  Without asking any other questions, goes and wires whoever this guy was money.  And I'm starting to get calls of like, why am I in jail?  I'm okay.  I'm like, I'm on my way home.  You know, it's like, I don't know why she fell for it or, you know. 
[01:45:00]  Can I offer an explanation as to why she fell for it?  She's a fool.  Your grandmother's a doddering old fool.  For the same reason she probably eats cat food and talks to the toaster.  She's a blithering idiot.  A lot of old people falling for this crap, man.  I had one in my family that fell for a lot of this stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  With the junk mail and you can win this and, you know, give us 100 here, 100 there. 
[01:45:30]  And it adds up.  Let me talk to my parents right now.  I'm serious.  Listen, I know you are.  The old people are very vulnerable to this crap.  My parents are getting up there.  They still have their faculties.  If either one of you gives away one nickel of my inheritance, I'll have Chief from Cuckoo's  Nest give you the old pillow treatment.  The Norton fortune.  You don't want to give that away.  My father has a Lionel train and my mother has a hat from 1974 that very much resembled 
[01:46:00]  Mary Tyler Moore's hat that I want.  That she threw up in the air?  She would throw it up in the air, yes.  How about that?  In fits of Tourette's.  She didn't mean to.  She would only do it in elevators.  And then the hat would be removed when she walked out of the elevator with any luck.  It's terrible.  Nick, anything else to the story?  Other than the fact that every time I see her, I got to kick on her about it because  it's just hilarious and everyone joins in. 
[01:46:30]  It's great.  Two grand.  I mean, that's almost, old people don't hear too good.  That's almost understandable.  It's only two G's and it's a one-time thing and you think your only grandson is being sodomized  by someone who goes, eh.  Yeah.  You know what you do?  Reach in, pull her fake teeth out, and then use them like a puppet to chastise her.  No, here's how you get the teeth out.  Just poke her hard in the stomach and she'll go, oof. 
[01:47:00]  And then make them chatter while you bang cymbals together.  You get chastise her with her own teeth.  Make a dummy puppet.  Embarrassing.  Being yelled at with your own teeth.  I'm stupid.  I'm stupid.  Nice.  Good luck to you and your stupid grandmother.  Sure.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Melissa in New York.  This happened to your mom, Melissa?  Yeah.  She bought into the same Nigerian scam. 
[01:47:30]  She, you know, we told her.  My dad, you know, cut her off.  He bailed her out out of like thousands and thousands of dollars.  And she, you know, he put his account in his own name and she's still trying to email  them to get the money back.  And I'm trying to tell her to stop.  She just doesn't get it.  Like, she doesn't believe it.  Have you shown her like things on websites that expose these as scams and word for word,  it's exactly what she's falling for?  Oh, absolutely.  And what does she say?  Like, what's her excuse?  Oh, that isn't me. 
[01:48:00]  That isn't this.  Yeah, she, I mean, I think she just has a problem.  I mean, she, you know, she had lost her job like a year ago and she thought it was an  easy way to get money.  At the stupid factory?  Yeah, pretty much.  All right.  That wasn't very good.  Yes, it was.  Perfect.  One of the listeners turning us on to a great website, 419eater.com.  We'll link that on onaradio.com.  But it's all about these scams.  Oh, okay.  Snopes has them too.  Yeah, but 419eater.com.  We just checked it out.  It's pretty good.  Well, that sucks. 
[01:48:30]  Is she still doing it, Melissa?  No.  I mean, I don't know.  My dad smashed her computer, actually, and put his account in his own name.  But she takes his check sometimes and does all this stuff.  It's a mess.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  We're going to go to Jersey.  Kristen, how are you, Kristen?  Good, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  I work for a law enforcement agency in Jersey.  And probably once a week, we get a call from somebody saying that they gave money to these 
[01:49:00]  people.  They send us their emails, and we start looking at it.  And it's always Nigerian.  Where's your office?  High-tension lines?  Yeah.  What's that?  Are you calling from a bird's nest?  Holy Jesus.  It sounded the noise McGreevy made through a glory hole.  There's a bee in her phone.  You work at a law firm?  It was in her bonnet, and all of a sudden it went into her bonnet.  Right.  Thank God I have a bee-less bonnet. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That's bad.  Now it's getting just horrible.  She's actually a bird lady, and that's why she's on top of the high-tension wire.  She landed, and now she's on the phone.  She's making a duty onto someone's hood.  Let's go to D.C.  We haven't heard from D.C. in a while.  Bonnie, how are you?  Hey, D.C. loves you guys.  Thank you, D.C.  How's the basketball team doing?  I don't know anything about sports.  I'm sorry. 
[01:50:00]  That's all good.  Good for you.  I figured I'd ask.  God love you.  Okay.  Okay, so I have a friend.  I work for a construction company, and he fell for the Craigslist roommate thing.  And, you know, she sends $6,500, and he has to send her back $2,500.  But the best part is that at the construction company, he's walking around with her picture  because it's some hot chick.  And he's like, check out who my roommate's going to be, and I'll brag him.  Oh, no.  And they actually, when he lost $2,500, they actually went around the company and made us  take up a fund to get his money back because they felt sorry for him. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, God.  What an idiot.  Don't fall for this stuff.  He's going around with the picture of the hot chick from Craigslist.  Yeah, good.  A Nigerian princess.  And he was bragging.  It was awesome.  It is awesome when you see a co-worker looking like an idiot.  So many great scams out there.  My God.  I went on a ride-along with cops once and went into this house, and there's some old lady, 
[01:51:00]  and she's crying because some of her stuff got stolen, and these women came to the door.  They apparently had, for a couple of days, they had been looking through the mail of this  woman's neighbor, and so they knew the name of the neighbor.  They knew kind of the name of the neighbor's daughter.  They kind of got a background on the neighbor.  Then they went to this old lady's house with material.  It's like this bolt of material, and said, I'm selling material.  I know you do sewing and stuff like that, because they checked her mail, too. 
[01:51:30]  And your neighbor, and then they give the name and everything.  She just bought a bolt of this material, and she loves it.  She said she's going to make a dress for her daughter.  So she knew the names and everything.  And then one of them pulls the material open and blocks the view of the other one,  who is now rummaging through the woman's pocketbook and goes into the bedroom,  opens up the jewelry boxes, all the rings and everything, as she's going, 
[01:52:00]  look how wonderful this material is, completely blocking the view of the other woman stealing.  What's she bringing, like a California king comforter, and the only one just stood in awe of it?  That's what she did, and she kept moving it around to block the view of whichever way this old lady looked.  You got to admit, it's brilliant.  It is.  I was like, wow, that's a good one.  That's a good one.  She's just staring at the swatch of cloth the way the apes look at that giant silver thing in 2001.  Yeah.  Dummy.  Look around it. 
[01:52:30]  Take a peek on the other side.  There's someone rummaging through your crap.  And hopefully the light was, like, shining through it in a certain way.  And she said, who's that lovely?  That's a lovely moving pattern of a black woman taking my jewelry.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I hadn't heard of that one yet.  The phone's just lit.  If you're on hold, we'll get to you after the break.  Well, Tom has a quickie, though.  Tom, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up?  Honestly, if this lady was my wife, when I was done with her, I'd make Scott Peterson look like an angel. 
[01:53:00]  Why?  The fact that this is a moron.  I got it.  I got it.  She wouldn't live.  All right.  Jimmy, I appreciate it.  Let's see you, man.  I got it.  So obnoxious.  I got someone good last night.  Colin's cousin, Tim Gage, was there.  Yeah.  And I joked about something that I hacked comedians and not changing material.  And Tim joked with me.  And he's like, I'm kind of like you in the last 12 years. 
[01:53:30]  I'm like, what?  And he was kind of like you.  I heard you.  Oh, was that satisfying.  Between the eyes.  It was a bat in the teeth.  That's a good beating.  Drew Boogie, get us out of here for a minute or two.  Opie and Anthony.  We'll be right back. 
[01:54:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:54:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:55:00]  I love an Italian grill, Hooper Avenue, Tom's River.  Thank you, Stephen.  It was unbelievable, especially the meat.  I love the meat.  I'm sorry, man.  I'm very psyched today.  We got a little while over on satellite.  We got Angus Young calling it.  I'm very psyched to talk to Angus Young today. 
[01:55:30]  When did that happen?  What?  I'm not even kidding.  Last night they said we want them.  I guess I...  Well, right on.  I figured we do want them.  Thanks for letting me know, Jimmy.  It's on the prep sheet.  I didn't know.  It's right there in big letters.  Oh, I see it there.  Angus Young.  Okay.  Whoever looks at that.  I know.  I was very happy, though.  That's very cool.  Yeah.  ACDC, what is it?  The number one album in...  In 29 countries.  29 countries.  The new album.  Black Ice, right?  Yeah.  Have you heard it?  I've heard something.  I like it.  I checked out some of the new stuff on the ACDC channel. 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  It's very good.  A quick story out of Boston.  It's a good story.  Driver.  Sneeze caused him to plunge into the Charles River.  Come on.  He's blaming it on a sneeze?  You know, I've spent some time up and down the Charles River.  And biking, running, a little inline skating.  I don't know how you could do this.  Yeah.  How is that possible?  It's not that easy.  A driver drove his truck into the Charles River on Tuesday afternoon. 
[01:56:30]  Andrew Hansen, 42, of Weymouth, was driving his Ford pickup truck on Soldiersfield Road  when his vehicle plunged into the Charles River.  The gentleman said he sneezed.  Next thing he knew, he was in the river.  Maybe he fainted or something.  You think?  Maybe he sneezed and...  His heart stopped or something.  One of those blood pressure things.  Hansen made it out of the truck without any injuries, but was taken to Beth Israel Hospital  as a precaution.  State police drivers spent a lot of time in the water before the rig was pulled out of 
[01:57:00]  the river and towed away.  It was unclear if any charges would be filed.  One of the filed charges.  Maybe he's saying it was a sneeze, but maybe...  You never know.  Sneezed white powder all over his mustache.  Oh.  That makes sense.  All right.  We've got to go back to the phone.  Steve the Trucker.  Steve, what are you hauling today, my friend?  Recycled metal right now.  Why?  I don't know.  There's just a loan. 
[01:57:30]  That's what they pay me for.  All right.  What do you got for the...  Let's the hooker say that.  You guys...  What do you got, Steve?  Wow.  You lost Steve.  All right.  Like Jimmy's brand of humor, maybe.  Hope he sneezed and wound up somewhere in freezing water.  Travis and Danny have fallen...  Not fallen, though, about some of these scams that are going on on the internet.  I heard this is...  Is there a car scam?  Dude, every single day there's multiple scams on Craigslist. 
[01:58:00]  Any city that you live in, I'm sure, that you can find out some of these car scams.  Say it's a woman.  Yes.  But there's also a big one going around where a guy will stand in a room and claim that  he's the father from family ties, and nobody will believe him.  He's looking right at you.  He's not smiling.  I'm just kidding. 
[01:58:30]  My head is getting hot.  All right.  What's the car scam?  Well, the car scam is usually...  It's a car.  It looks good.  There's pictures of it.  And it's low miles for a low price.  And then you kind of know...  Well, at least me.  I know it's too good to be true.  But I'm like, well, let's just see what happens anyway.  You never know.  So, I mean, probably 99 out of 100 times, it's going to be somebody who has this car  that's, for some reason, not located anywhere near you, although it was posted locally in  your local Craigslist.  And then the whole scam is that they'll ship you the car. 
[01:59:00]  And the way that the money works is a third party will hold onto the money until you inspect  the car.  And then they'll release the money to him, and then you get all the documentation for  the car.  So, why can't your friend be the third party?  Well, it doesn't work that way, unfortunately.  Oh, oh.  Or how about just an escrow company?  Well, that's what...  How about an escrow company is the third party?  Well, what they use is something called the eBay Buyer Protection something program or whatever.  But, I mean, it's not that hard to just, you know, falsify, like, to make a site look 
[01:59:30]  like it's eBay.  And that's how they...  That's obviously what the scam is and how they take your money.  But it's just so funny.  Like, who's believing that, like...  Like, for instance, this one that I popped up in my email, supposedly there's, like, some  2004 Camry located in Croatia.  And they're going to ship me the car, you know, for free, and I get to look at it.  And it says here in the email that if I don't like the car, I should just keep it anyway  because I'll be able to sell it over here and get my money back.  That's a great deal.  It is.  I know.  I can't believe I didn't go for this one.  It's fantastic.  What's your problem?  Yeah.  Reminds me of the pickup truck I bought from the sedan. 
[02:00:00]  They said, you know, machine gun mounted on the back.  It comes with the terrorists in there.  And he even gives me a little bit of...  They're scammed to get over here.  This comes with five jihadists.  And this guy was nice enough to give me some of his backstory.  His name is Sergeant Carlson, and he's located in Croatia, and he was sent here to improve  the military relationships between our country and Croatia.  Sure.  Yeah, all right.  Unbelievable.  Travis has one, too?  Oh, yeah.  When we were looking for apartments last year, the same thing as Danny.  You email back just because you want to see if it's true or not. 
[02:00:30]  And my email started with, hello, dear, even though this is a guy that's emailing me.  And pretty much, same thing.  This guy is on a missionary trip to West Africa.  Yeah.  So all you need to do is, as soon as you make the fill the rent application form, the next  step for you now is for you to make payment deposit for one month, which is $1,000 via  Western Union money transfer, and then he'll send me the keys to the apartment. 
[02:01:00]  This beautiful apartment, $1,000 rent on West 67th Street.  Really?  How did you not take that?  Do you get to see it first?  Come on.  Who's the broker?  No, because...  Idi Amin.  You have to see the broker.  It's Paul Pot Incorporated.  Paul Pot.  No food allowed in the building.  Because once I send them $1,000, I will get entrance and the rooms keys, paper slash permanent 
[02:01:30]  house form.  What is that?  I don't know, but I'm getting it.  The house documentary file.  The house documentary file.  Oh my God.  Isn't that what Earl works on all the time?  Payment receipt.  Right.  And full address and description of the house.  Well, good thing they give you the address.  Yes.  They just have to knock on doors and go, is this my house?  It's no description.  They forget to mention it has no roof or walls.  It's just space.  It's out there.  There's just giant walls, 40 stories high, and then you realize it's in a little alley 
[02:02:00]  between two buildings.  I don't know how people are so stupid to fall.  That guy looked just like Michael Gross.  He was hot over the collar, too.  Was he?  He didn't want to go with the joke at all.  Of course he didn't.  Took his omelet and then beat it.  Exactly.  Fontaine, Detroit, how are you?  Hope he gets syphilis in his beard.  Hey, boys.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Is it?  Sorry.  Jimmy was rocking there, Fontaine.  I blew it.  But is it cold in the day, Fontaine? 
[02:02:30]  Opie, it is colder than the M or F-er in the day this morning.  Oh, no.  Is it?  It's so cold in the day.  It's 22 degrees.  Do the best.  We are.  It's so cold in the day.  It's so cold in the day.  You should redo that one, Drew.  Well, it's cold in the day, right?  Why do you have your coat on?  You got one more remix to do.  It's cold in the day.  Oh, he packed up?  And why?  All right, Fontaine, what do you got?  Hey, Opie, congratulations, by the way, too, buddy.  Thank you.  You go. 
[02:03:00]  Problem.  Really, really happy for you.  Thank you.  Those guys are getting really, really good with those cams.  I met a chick, well, probably a guy, on an interracial dating site.  Anthony, shut up.  I know.  Wow.  I know.  Anthony's typing in trader.com.  I was so ready to say something.  You read my mind, sir.  A little interracial love, huh?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Beautiful chick.  She said she was from Springfield, Mass., but she was in Nigeria or whatever. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, boy.  And she needed money to come back, and she needed money to feed her son.  And I started asking stuff.  Like, I asked her, I said, do you know anything about chickpeas?  And she knew nothing.  And anybody, anywhere around Springfield, Mass., knows chickpea, but I probably would have  sent chick money.  She was hot.  But I heard it on you guys' show like four years ago.  I was like, ah, nope.  Interracial date.  What's the site?  The first page, it's a dad, and there's just a big middle finger point that I'm on. 
[02:04:00]  God, people are falling for these scams, huh?  Yep.  Wow.  I did not know.  Another victim of the tiny shirt club comes in.  Hi, Nick.  Hey, buddy.  Look at you.  Tiny shirt club.  What's up, Nick?  Jump the broom.  Look at you.  What?  Jump the broom.  Jump the broom.  It's a marriage thing.  Oh.  That's how African-American marriage.  Slaves get married.  Jump the broom.  Use the mic.  There you go.  Oh, E-Rog.  Oh, E-Rog got you. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, S.  Obama president.  Nah.  You see Sam's shirt?  No.  Did no one else notice Sam's freaking T-shirt today?  I never take my eyes off his lovely little ass.  I look at his lips.  Look at his, my president is black.  Wow.  That's a great shirt.  It's funny.  Wow.  You have boondocks hair.  But I think you were.  It is perfect.  I think you were a McCain guy, though.  Yeah, I voted for McCain.  So why are you, why are you got the My President is Black shirt on?  That's what the hip-hop kids are wearing now.  I'm trying to fit in. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, God.  You're the worst hip-hop kid.  Just trying to represent.  Yeah.  Are you trying to represent?  This show needs a little flavor.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, my God.  I gotta get a picture of that.  All right.  That is nice.  Where'd you get that?  One of the hip-hop mixtape websites.  Oh, you sent for it?  Yeah.  Maybe you bought it off the streets up there uptown.  Yeah, I did.  I bought it on the streets.  And then he just goes, yeah.  See, look.  Doesn't that look like Sam?  Yeah, it's like, yeah, that's what I did.  Why do you have to put on the black face? 
[02:05:30]  It's a tough face.  Put on black face.  Put on the tough face.  Tough guy face.  Tough guy face.  I got you talking, so now it doesn't look good.  Oh, now you look kind of silly.  Uh-huh.  All right.  We gotta get out of here.  Thank you, Sam.  Coming up in an hour, we got Angus.  Yes.  Yeah.  Angus Young.  I want to thank Basil Teas for the omelets today.  Great food.  Fantastic.  Stephen Farley, executive chef, came in to do that for us.  Hooper Avenue in Tom's River, right?  And can we mention, too, that our pal Patrice will be doing the shows live. 
[02:06:00]  For a couple days.  Tomorrow and Friday because we're off.  Yes.  And, you know, so we'll have Patrice in it doing whatever it is he does.  Yes.  I'm sure it's going to be a very well-balanced.  Wait, tomorrow?  Yeah.  Racial point of view show.  Yeah.  We're off tomorrow?  You guys, anyway.  You are.  I honestly don't have a clue.  Yes, we're on tomorrow.  We were going to do shows.  All right.  The people are begging for an Anthony Patrice show.  Tomorrow's your opportunity, my friend. 
[02:06:30]  You should come in for a little bit, do a set or two.  Call from bed.  That's right.  Or at least call from bed.  What people are begging?  People that know nothing about this program?  Yeah, exactly.  Newbies?  Well, our new thing is we're going to try to keep live programming going when we go  on vacation, take days off.  I think that's the way to go because we've got a lot of great people that help us with  the radio show.  So we're trying to develop this and it's starting tomorrow with Patrice doing a show for us  Thursday and Friday.  How awful would it be if they just fired us and hired him?  Whatever.  It could happen, though. 
[02:07:00]  It can't.  Anything could happen in this business.  It can't.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  We're supposed to be off the air already.  Yes.  All right.  We're supposed to be good boys.  Since 2002.  Bye, guys.  Have a great weekend.  Yes.  And a lot will have changed by the time we see you next.  Not really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll still be late.  It doesn't matter.  You will, but a lot will have changed.  You know that K-Rock, they wanted the K-Rock girls to walk me over to the other joint tonight?  Oh, why not? 
[02:07:30]  Like, what?  That's harmless.  It's stupid.  It's just silly.  Why would I want that?  Eh, good, Glee Fund.  Because the options are E-Rock and Sam.  True.  I'll take K-Rock girls over E-Rock and Sam.  And some degenerates.  Yeah.  The thought is nice, I guess.  Yeah.  I guess I should acknowledge the thought.  They're not trying to be dirty.  They're just like, oh, do something.  You know, they think.  Oh, the K-Rock girls will walk them.  Last gasp was singlehood thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about the rest of us who are going to remain single and may want one of the K-Rock girls? 
[02:08:00]  Yay!  Yay!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yay!  Love Alan Alda.  Love him.  Let's go over the other.  But live programming will continue for a few more days anyway on this fine channel.  And it's something we really want to develop.  So, you know, bear with us and support that.  All right?  Bye.  See you soon.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:08:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  i gotta start yelling more exactly i gotta start yelling more to boogie helping us out today 
[02:09:00]  i don't even remember what that's from what was i mad about that day  uh where are you oh he actually knows you were talking about a uh a read that they were making  you do some back and forth thing where you're reading somebody else answers you right right  right those things they were making up those dopey lines yeah we've met a lot of celebrities  over the years according to commercials we've done yeah let's talk to right now let's not really 
[02:09:30]  say we are gotta add them to the list of celebrities i've met over the years yeah i guess i've officially  met roseanne and uh who's that other one the hot the hot chick that used to be hot she used to be  hot tanya roberts oh right right right right right used to be right right right hey uh it's a quickie  to start this side of the show uh one of our favorite news clips ever is this this stomping  uh grapes lady oh yeah knocking getting the wind knocked out of her yelling for help and the and 
[02:10:00]  the stupid anchors back in the um you know the studio don't know what to do oh gosh i guess family  guy did a fine little thing on this yes they did so we want to play the original clip first and then  you got stewie's uh interpretation of it i love that family guy that's funny i'm saying to the  guys off air it's like we love family guy and it's too bad we don't really have a good relationship  with seth mcfarland he calls and it's like you don't hate the guy or nothing but the can't get 
[02:10:30]  can't get past that like hump that we got past with like kevin smith and stuff right right we just  you get over that speed bump and all of a sudden you're you know we would love to have a relationship  like we have with like you said kevin smith ricky gervais and some of these really really funny  people but it just the chemistry is just we try every time too yeah you know huh seth yeah but i  don't i'm not trying to trash the guy so some people get along with and some of you yeah we get along 
[02:11:00]  and he's just an odd guy some people get along with some are complete assholes right no i'm teasing  of course stop it he's an amazing guy though because he went from having a canceled tv show  so i think he just signed a few months ago a 10 a 10 year deal with fox worth over a hundred  million dollars wow and that and the show was gone canceled right it was gone and because the  dvd sales were so well they actually brought it back from the dead and now it's the biggest thing  and what is he doing on youtube he's doing family guy characters as different people because i think 
[02:11:30]  fox owns family guy now yeah well he's doing like these little short animated i just saw one  they're really weird and and they're odd it's it's it's kind of borrowing from family guy humor but  it's going a little deeper than that and it's just these little minute long shorts that he's  putting together it's on youtube and it looks like family guy but obviously there's something going  on with him and fox where he can't use the characters so he's coming up with new characters  that's sort of like the ones from the one that i saw was was it was uh jeff goldblum selling jeff 
[02:12:00]  goldblum wafers and it's just weird but he's putting these out on a regular basis so it's a it's a  moneymaker for the guy that's good yeah maybe we could get uh get that all right so here's the  original clip out of atlanta a station called waga uh reporter doing her stomping grape story right  and all hell breaks loose most people know this clip very very well love this one so what's the  deal here you there's a contest to stomp and how are you measuring who does the best stomping  and whoever stomps the most shoots wins an overnight stay but it's not the only thing you can do

Finally, a mere ten years after the original broadcast.  We've been playing this clip for how many years, really?  Yeah, it's been a while.  Easily six to eight years. 
[02:14:00]  Congratulations.  You two now own the hottest spot in town.  How'd you pay for all this?  I got a job as a field reporter for Channel 5 News.  And all the juice is being collected underneath?  Yes, and whoever collects the most is going to win a free weekend here at the Chateau with international foods and wine tastings.  Stop.  Oh.  Oh.

Oh.  Oh.  I can't breathe.  Ah, shit.  Very funny.  You guys missed the boat on this one.  This was from years ago. Family Guy just referenced  the scene this past Sunday.  That's why the video is exploding again, according to  Spikey J.  Alright, whatever. Didn't we say that? 
[02:15:00]  No, no, no. We said that the reporter  happened years ago.  This scene making fun of the reporter happened years ago, too.  No, it was from  like Brandon. No, it was  just on last week's Family Guy. Read what  that dumb cunt wrote.  Well, his name is Spikey J.  And he doesn't like to be called a dumb cunt.  Alright, well, what did you say?  He writes,  you guys missed  the boat on this one. This is from  years ago. Family Guy  just referenced the scene this past 
[02:15:30]  Sunday. That's why the video  is exploding again.  We're on the boat!  You know what? He might have to be called a dumb cunt  after all. Yes! He's stupid.  We did explain that.  I hope he said this is like 8 years old, this clip or something.  And Family Guy just did it.  So that's why we played the clip  and then played Family Guy doing it.  You are an idiot.  Spikey J.  I'm with Ant.  I was trying to defend you, but I think  we explained it perfectly.  Wow!  Are you some kind of stupid? 
[02:16:00]  How are you  some kind of stupid?  I know you could be  some kind of wonderful.  It's a type of stupid that I'm not  even sure of.  It's some kind of stupid.  Who doesn't enjoy  some kind of wonderful?  Some kind of stupid.  A wonderful.  Some kind of stupid.  Yes, he is.  See, you know the song.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dad has to go.  I'll be right back.  I have to do something.  What?  All right.  No, you don't.  I do.  All right.  Why do you have to be a star 
[02:16:30]  other places when you're a star here?  If I was a star other places,  I wouldn't have to whore my book  in a vain attempt to stay on a list  that I'm probably going to get  booted off of.  Ah, vain.  Believe me.  Artie Lang, they said  may hit number one  and then best on the list.  He's going to be in the top five.  All right.  Yeah, so.  You think?  Oh, I know.  Better than you?  Yeah, that's right.  He's more famous.  No, he's not.  No, he's not, Jimmy.  I'm yawning just talking to Jimmy.  He was on your show.  You weren't on his show.  Yeah.  He was on your show on HBO.  Yes, yes.  Yes, yes.  Yes, but right now 
[02:17:00]  I'm going to go out  and prostitute myself.  Please buy the book  with my asshole open  and a picture of the book  on the back.  If you put your dick in,  you get a free copy.  Oh, wait, no.  If you buy one,  you get to put your dick in.  That's the wrong.  Have the book open  and a picture of your asshole  on the back.  With a book with a dress  with a dress with a book.  Suck this cock.  Hey, the Seth MacFarlane thing  is called, what,  a cavalcade of comedy?  Something like that?  Cavalcade of comedy.  These little shorts  by Seth MacFarlane.  And someone is saying  it's off sethcomedy.com 
[02:17:30]  and that he's doing it  for maybe Burger King.  Is that true?  Really?  That's right.  Yeah, well,  they're sponsored by Burger King.  When are we going to get  our Burger King sponsorship, Ant?  I think it's about time.  I don't know.  Everyone else does.  He diddy.  You had it.  And remember,  they would give away  those free gift cards  on the walkover.  Right, on the walkover.  Hey, we did it.  I guess everybody does  at some point in their life  become sponsored  by Burger King.  All right.  It's good Jimmy left  because this phone call  might put Anthony  in a tizzy.  Why?  And it also puts 
[02:18:00]  Jimmy,  old Jimmy Norton  in a tough position.  It's Nick in Atlanta.  How are you, Nick?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Nick.  Hey, every day's  not complete  until you have  a little Gene Simmons.  Old Gene is ringing  the bell at NASDAQ  this morning.  I figured you may want  to tune in  to your hero.  Oh, is that what he's doing?  I saw him on the news.  It was like,  what?  Why?  What's going public,  Kiss?  Is that what's happening?  The Kiss stock  is going public.  It's going to be 
[02:18:30]  a great thing.  I'm having an IPO  for KISS.  Shut up,  you fucking,  you money-grubbing  fucko.  Why do you hold a grudge?  What?  You're holding a grudge.  He personally  insulted me.  Yeah.  He disrespected me.  Yeah.  in front of me,  right in front of my face  with knowledge  that he had  that I did not have  at the time  and was trying  to make me look  silly  in his eyes.  He thought he was 
[02:19:00]  Mr. Big...  Can we go to the...  Can we go...  Can we go...  We did pretty well  yesterday.  Heidi Bulls  showed some resilience  late in the trading session  but today we're expecting  a lower open  and the major averages  once again  test their recent lows.  As one analyst says,  the 400-pound gorilla  in the room  is the auto bailout  on Capitol Hill  yesterday.  UAW union president  Ron Gettlefinger  said that if one  of the big three  goes bankrupt,  it could take  the other two  down with it.  This comes amid  more signs of distress 
[02:19:30]  in the housing market.  New home construction  plunged 4.5% last month.  He pushes the button.  His wigs should fly off  when he hits the button.  That'd be great.  D-listed from the  New York Stock Exchange  because the share price  has been under a dollar  for a month now.  Well, that's all  he got to do.  That's it.  He presses a button  so the bell rings  and then he gave  the fucking  rock and roll sign.  Right.  Kind of a devil's...  The horns.  The devil horn  rock and roll sign.  But he had the thumb out  though too.  Why is he doing it?  What does he have 
[02:20:00]  to do with anything?  Usually the people  that ring the bell  have something to do  with Wall Street.  Well, I'm sure  he's got something  going on.  He's selling something.  He's got shares  in something.  My videotapes  of my sexploits.  You'll see me  fuck in slow motion.  That's the only way  I can fuck.  Oh, please.  Why did we mention  Gene Simmons?  Try your best.  Try your best,  asshole.  Whatever.  How are you going  to hold this grudge?  Forever.  Forever?  He disrespected me. 
[02:20:30]  What happens  if he comes in here  and defends his position?  I will lay into him  on every front.  Not even on the fact  that he was trying  to pick up  my girlfriend  at the time.  Do I have to remind you  of what happened  when you confronted  Man Cow?  You gave him  some of the best radio ever?  I gave him a great call.  What a dick.  You gave him  a thought starter?  I did.  And I'm sure  his phones were lit  with traditional radio  after you hung up  for another half hour.  But no,  Gene Simmons  will never be forgiven.  So you promise  that there will be  a nice confrontation  when he finally comes in here? 
[02:21:00]  I will just pummel him  about his fucking  sellout attitude  and then he'll just be like,  I'm making money  off of my company.  Yeah.  Off of Kiss.  That's what I do.  This stuff gets back  to Gene, you know.  He called us out  on something else.  Fuck Gene.  And we did pretty well  defending our position.  They're showing a replay  of him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he points  like, yeah.  Oh, it says  Gene Simmons  family jewels  behind him.  That fucking  reality show.  Yeah.  Stop. 
[02:21:30]  It's a fake reality.  But it's not real.  It's like third or fourth season.  It's doing very well.  How is it doing well?  Who's watching that crap?  I don't know.  Garbage.  Who's buying his Kiss garbage?  Grow up, people.  Fucking grow up.  There's a lot of Kiss fans out there.  What are you buying?  A Kiss thing?  Shut up,  stupid Kiss fans out there.  You suck.  You worship this fucking  fossil.  Let it go, Ant.  This fucking wigged fossil.  Let it go.  You made your point.  No.  You made your point.  Never let it go.  You made your point.  He sat there 
[02:22:00]  in that fucking seat  knowing  what he  attempted to do  and failed miserably  and then  gave me shit about it.  Like  I'm sitting here  like some kind of mook.  Why  I never.  He is quite a douche.  The Seth MacFarlane thing.  SethComedy.com  We'll give him a nice plug today.  Fucking queen.  Gene Simmons is a queen.  What?  He's a fucking queen. 
[02:22:30]  Why is he a queen?  I'm just calling him that.  Draw your own conclusions.  Now it's name calling.  Yeah.  Can we get Gene on the phone today?  He's in New York.  Good one.  Maybe he could stop by.  He knows where we are.  We're working on it.  Are we working on it?  Fuck him.  When is the confrontation going down,  do you think?  I don't know.  Whenever he fucking steps in here.  Steve?  Making some calls?  1050.  I'll make a call right now,  but that process is ongoing.  The requests have been in to get Gene in here.  Of course.  And what has he said?  Nothing yet.  Nothing yet.  We're waiting for a response. 
[02:23:00]  He's scared.  What about his people?  What is it?  What are...  We're checking his schedule is the response you always get.  I have to check with my schedule.  My schedule.  And call him out live on the show.  What?  I call you out.  I call you out, Gene Simmons.  We're going to do a fight?  Show up here, and I'm going to fucking call you out first  for blatant disrespect of me  and for just being a fucking whore  and a queen  and a lousy fuck  as proved on his lousy fuck videotape 
[02:23:30]  called  I'm Gene Simmons, a lousy fuck.  What would it take for it to get to fisticuffs?  For real.  If I come to blows.  Yeah?  Could come to blows.  Are we fighting after school today?  I'd pop him.  If I popped him in the face,  a lawyer would pop out his asshole  and serve me with a subpoena  in a second.  That's my asshole lawyer,  and you are now sued.  What if he said no lawyers?  Do what you have to. 
[02:24:00]  Fist of man to man?  Yeah.  With fists?  Yeah.  Will he get to wear his big, tall shoes?  Yeah.  So he looks bigger than the short little Jew he is?  Is he really short, do you think?  He's Jewish.  I don't know if he's short.  There's some tall Jews.  He's been in here.  I think he's...  What's some of those tall Jews?  Jeff Goldblum.  Which leads to what we want to play for everybody.  That's called a segue in the biz, people.  And Danny just look at each other. 
[02:24:30]  He's the only one.  And I must say, on instant feedback,  they're kind of getting the chills  of the douche variety  because they know how this is going to end.  How?  With maybe a back down on your part.  Nope.  Ain't going to back down.  I'll fucking...  I will leave the situation before I back down.  If he won't...  Like, because he always just keeps talking,  you know,  or he'll put his hand over the keyboard  while Danny's trying to type  because what he's saying is so fucking important  that hearing a clickety-clack over it  just ruins it. 
[02:25:00]  What the fuck is that idiot saying  that's so important  that a clickety-clack of a keyboard  of a new keyboard  they barely make a noise.  And I was trying to be extra quiet.  Yeah.  He was upset, Danny,  because you weren't paying attention to him.  Yeah.  Because he's in the room  and someone wasn't paying attention to him in the room.  I gotta say,  Danny backed down as well.  I'm disappointed in Danny as well.  No, you know what?  You should have been like,  clang, clang, clang.  Oh, I just started hitting him with a mallet.  I'd have played whack a key. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  With a fucking mallet.  It's not my show.  Well.  That's the only reason  I didn't get up in his face a little boy.  Next time he comes in,  we're going to have a xylophone for you.  Dude, I swear,  I have an old keyboard from the 80s  that's just covered in filth  and it's so loud and terrible.  Like, you can't even pretend to be quiet on it  because the minute you apply pressure,  it's just click, clack.  I like the xylophone idea, though.  Yeah.  Just come in with a xylophone.  Oh, would that be great? 
[02:26:00]  All right.  Well, Frankenstein was a tall Jew.  Thank you, Pat from Monarchi.  Same guy, him and Gene.  Just pull the wig off, Gene.  You know, Frankenstein.  I'm Frankenstein.  Yeah.  What exactly did Gene do?  People don't know yet?  Carl.  What, are you insane?  Carl.  I was locked up  around the beginning of  the show in Nickomini.  I mean, Nickomini,  I'm guessing it's got to do with that, 
[02:26:30]  but I just got out  and I don't know what's going on,  so I'm trying to get caught up.  All right, hold on.  What are you locked up for?  Yeah, we want to be caught up with you.  You got locked up for what?  Well, it was a bunch of  outstanding parking tickets  and warrants,  and then I beat up a cop.  Wow, we got a lot of cop friends.  They're not happy to hear this today, Carl.  No, no, no, no.  I love the cops.  I really do.  But this guy was one of those  two sizes,  two small,  mirrored sunglasses,  talked to the judge,  talked to the judge,  and I just really had enough of him. 
[02:27:00]  Well, you can't hit them.  Yeah, you can't hit a cop.  That might be a bad thing.  I didn't mean to.  All right.  So how much time did you do?  Are you calling from a Matrix phone?  It sounds like the Matrix.  It's a piece of crap  public internet phone.  All right.  How much time did you do  for beating up the cop  in the parking tickets?  After all was said and done  and my lawyers and my money,  it was probably about  five and a half months. 
[02:27:30]  Oy.  Oy.  What was the worst thing  that happened to you in the joint?  Nothing.  No, it's bullshit.  You got raped in the ass,  didn't you?  All right.  Yes.  It's not gay if you're in jail.  You know that, right?  Yeah, of course not.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, Carl.  So, well,  you need to know what happened.  Gene Simmons  went over to the news  over there.  What is it called? 
[02:28:00]  The CW11 News.  Where Jill McClainy  was doing  the traffic at the time  and pretty much  pinned her against the wall  and started coming on to her.  So, why don't we go out tonight?  Me and you.  Let's go out.  We'll go out.  And other people in the room  were very uncomfortable  with the way he was  coming on to her like that  because he was being  overly aggressive  almost like a rape. 
[02:28:30]  So then  she says,  no, I got a boyfriend.  And then  he was like,  I don't care.  I don't care.  Whatever.  And then she goes,  by the way,  you're going over there  to see him  in a few minutes.  When you leave here,  you're doing his radio show.  It's Anthony  from the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't care.  Doesn't matter to me.  Whatever.  So he finally,  you know,  backs off  puts his  shitty working  fucking  shit fucking dick  away 
[02:29:00]  and came over here,  sat down in that very chair  and  said to me  that maybe  I'll fuck your girlfriend  tonight.  Which was like,  ha ha.  And it was like a ha ha thing.  But it was based on  some stuff.  And then  I started laughing like,  well, you know,  I said if you only knew  who she was  and he didn't fess up  that he did know,  he didn't fess up  about his  like just fucking  the way he was  coming on like that. 
[02:29:30]  So he  disrespected me  by saying that  and by pulling that crap  even after he knew  that she had a boyfriend  and it was me  and whatever.  Now,  like I said,  I don't give a shit  because, you know,  that relationship's  ancient history.  But it's a man thing.  But it's a thing that  that transcends  the relationship.  It becomes an issue  of two men  being in a room  and him being  a fucking asshole  and then being  disrespectful to me. 
[02:30:00]  And I'm not going to  fucking have him  come on here  and hawk  hawk his wares  and sell his  kiss garbage  and use this  as a platform  to make even  more money  off of those  rubes that  fucking  buy his shit.  What the fuck?  He's still talking  about Gene Simmons.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter now  but I really wonder  why Jill  didn't give you  a heads up  when he was  on the way here.  She told me 
[02:30:30]  after the fact  because she didn't  want a big deal  made of it.  She didn't want  a big deal made of it.  I understand why  she didn't want  to disrupt the show  and be like the chick  who gets people  in trouble.  Right, right, right.  So she didn't want  to make a big deal  of it.  She didn't want  to give us good radio.  I understand.  But now,  it would have  been an amazing  radio.  Dude, I think  she pretty much  was a trooper  with good radio.  Yeah, I gotta say.  Good point.  People don't think  in life  that'll be good radio.  Yeah, yeah.  No one thinks  that really. 
[02:31:00]  In real life, yeah.  Alright, so how  does this end  with the confrontation?  Gene Simmons  sitting there  at some point.  He will sit there.  I will explain  that situation  as I just did.  Yelling?  Or calmly?  Calmly,  but with  with barbs.  I will fucking  I will inject  some barbs  into him  as I'm doing it  because he won't  let me fucking  talk anyway.  Right.  He'll be talking  and then he'll just  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:31:30]  Why so upset, Anthony?  Anthony.  His condescending  passive aggressive  shit.  Yeah.  Can we have the official  Anthony's calling out  Gene Simmons promo  for this fine channel  of ours?  Of course.  The official Anthony  has called you out, Gene.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  We want the official promo  and I want to hear it  sooner than later.  Gene Simmons,  you're a lousy fuck,  you're disrespectful,  and I fucking  call you out.  Oh!  Yes. 
[02:32:00]  Yes.  No, he didn't.  That might be  a little too harsh.  You might have to  call somebody out  a little different  so they're willing  to come to the table.  See, I wouldn't be  willing to come to the table  if I heard of that.  You better come to the table.  I wouldn't.  You better come to the table.  Oh, shit.  That's it.  Could it end in a fake fight  like you have to be  held back?  Oh.  Like you're trying  to get to him.  Let me at him.  Let me at him.  But they're holding you back.  It should end like  one of the old  Monday night wrestling shows 
[02:32:30]  where it's just like  the big climax is happening  but they're running  out of time.  They got to go.  Oh, no.  We're out of time, king.  And then it just cuts off.  Sam runs in with the steel chair  and it just fades to black.  You remember that shit?  He used to just stop.  Yeah.  There'd be a giant fight  going on  and they'd be like,  oh, we're going to wrap  this slobber knocker up.  And you come out Monday  and it's never referenced again.  No.  What the fuck?  We've had great  confrontations over the years.  Let's not forget  the man-cow confrontation,  the Whoopi Goldberg confrontation. 
[02:33:00]  That was just an amazing one.  Jim Simmons has to try  to hit on fucking  other guys' chicks  because that's the only  in he has with girls.  He talks about  his fucking prowess.  From what I saw  in that videotape,  he couldn't fucking,  he can't fuck.  He's awful.  I think the promo's too harsh.  I'll redo it for you  real quick.  All right.  Go ahead.  Anthony Comia  needs to talk 
[02:33:30]  to Gene Simmons.  This is Jim Norton.  Big fan, Gene.  Love the old stuff.  Oh, boy.  And Anthony wants  to talk to Gene  about something.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  What's wrong with that?  Love the old stuff.  What's wrong with that?  I think it was too nice.  All right.  Like, then he might feel  like he's blindsided  when he comes in.  You know what?  You're right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not that I care.  We're working on the  calling out Gene Simmons  official promo. 
[02:34:00]  Just do something  with the wig.  The wig.  Gene, I call you out.  Come on this show  and I'll rip  your fucking wig off.  Oh!  Too harsh.  Too harsh?  Too harsh.  No, we'll come on  the show to have  their wig taken off.  Who would?  I wouldn't.  Damn it.  We'll see what kind  of balls he has.  How about this?  Not too good.  Big droopy ones  from watching  that fucking porno.  That horrid porno 
[02:34:30]  that he made  to try to fucking  get a little heat.  What happened there, Gene?  What happened there, Gene?  Didn't pan out for you  that fucking porno?  Ugh.  Learn how to fuck  and then tape it.  Maybe you should  tape a few and  preview it.  What's the sounds  of Gene Simmons  having sex again?  What? 
[02:35:00]  I'm fucking a girl.  I'm a fucking...  I'm Gene Simmons.  Could you fuck me  faster, Gene?  No, no, no.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Fucking plastic face  wigged head.  It says kiss  at the New York Stock Exchange.  No.  It's just Gene Simmons.  Look at him.  What the fuck  is he pointing at? 
[02:35:30]  I just want to say...  What is this idiot  saying?  Please, I gotta hear it.  We're trying to get  the audio in.  Get the audio.  I want to hear what  this complete fucking  asshole is saying.  He was calling you out.  Yes, I call you out.  Ugh.  Do we have enough audio  for the calling out promo?  Look at that fucking  G.I.  Joe hair.  It's fake.  Do you need calling out  promo audio?  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  Gene Simmons,  this is Jim Norton.  Had a great time  at the roast.  Anthony is calling you out.  He takes umbrance  at what you've said.  Umbrance?  Is that not a word?  I thought it was umbridge.  Oh.  Umbrance.  I'll take some umbrance, too.  That's right.  It's hot in here.  He likes some umbrance  and a little umbridge.  Umbrance.  Umbrance.  Oh, come on.  Gene Simmons,  star of A&E Reality. 
[02:36:30]  Show Family Jewels.  That's right.  There's Paul.  There's Ace.  Hey, yeah.  Know what I'm getting  for Christmas?  The Gene Simmons  Guitar Hero guitar.  Oh, wow.  He actually was able  to finagle his fucking  way into that, huh?  Yeah.  Looks good, though.  Oh, it's the axe guitar?  Yeah.  Looks like a big battle axe?  Yeah, you can get that  for Guitar Hero, man.  Gene is so cool.  Who wouldn't want this?  You're just jealous.  Ugh.  I smell Gene's fucking  last album.  What is that? 
[02:37:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, what's the...  Oh, Jimmy farted?  I get sad when people are funny.  I bet the underside  of Gene's wig  smells like that.  That's what it smells like.  Oh, God.  That's horrible.  Wow, that's bad.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Boreskin is not happy.  Boreskin, what's going on?  Hey, and don't you know  if Gene can kick your ass, man?  You know how good a shape  you got to be in  to go on tour  and be around all like that?  Fuck that.  I saw the video  of him fucking.  He sucks. 
[02:37:30]  If you can't fuck,  you can't fight.  Fuck him.  What the fuck?  Fuck him.  We're getting some advice  here for you.  We got Kevin the trucker.  Kevin.  Hey, good evening.  Good evening.  Guys, here's the thing.  Because he's so  passive-aggressive,  and I'm on your side  about this,  you know he's going  to come at you  with that whole,  well, I've obviously  affected you.  You'll have no effect  on me kind of attitude.  I just want to know  what your response  to that would be.  I'll say, shut up.  Wow, that's... 
[02:38:00]  All right.  That's scary.  All right.  That's kind of scary.  No, I'll say,  I'm not going to play  your stupid  passive-aggressive game  where you sit there  all calm  and just talk it out  and then make like,  because I'm angry  that I'm the wrong one  or the crazy one here.  You're a douche.  You're fucking...  You sold out  your band,  your institution,  your bandmates.  Everyone knows.  Everyone calls you  a douchebag  behind your back  or to your face.  I'm just doing it  to your face.  Most people do it  behind your back. 
[02:38:30]  I'll just throw shit  in like that.  I go,  everyone knows  you're a fucking  money-grubbing asshole  who would sell  his own mother  for a fucking buck  because that's what  you do.  You took the rest  of the guys  in the band  who were key players  when Kiss was  at its peak  years ago  and just sold  them all down  the fucking river.  And you keep  the franchise going  because that's  all you got.  Damn.  Because obviously  you can't fuck  and sell porno tapes.  It's got to end 
[02:39:00]  with the wig  being removed.  And then  take the wig!  Linger longer.  I like that.  Take the wig.  Lingy-longy.  Lingy-longy.  Lingy-longy.  That's the promo  you guys want.  Oh, here we go.  Fred from Brooklyn.  He's good for one.  Hey, Fred!  Hello, Fred.  Hey.  Congrats, Opie.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Hey, you better have  some of New York's finest  standing by.  Gene blows fire.  Watch it, Ed. 
[02:39:30]  That's true.  He is a demon.  He blows fire.  What if he breathes  some of that fire on you?  Ted fire.  Then what?  Ted fire.  What if he breathes  that fire on you?  I'll dodge it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's blowing fire.  I'm dodging it.  You're going to back out,  aren't you?  No, why would I?  Why would I?  I think you back out.  Nope.  This is a man-to-man issue.  He disrespected me  as a man. 
[02:40:00]  He disrespected me,  which is the worst  thing you can do.  Not as a performer,  he didn't disrespect me,  which I don't care,  or anything like that.  No opinion on this,  that, the other thing.  He disrespected me.  All right, let's go to...  He knew the deal,  yet he sat in that fucking chair  and gave me what of it,  thinking that he wasn't  going to say anything  because that night,  you know,  they were going to go out.  Yeah.  He still had it in his head  that, you know,  we're going to go out.  We're going to go out.  Can we get Jill on the phone  together? 
[02:40:30]  No, she's never going to  get on the phone.  She hates me.  Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate, how are you?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Nate.  I just wanted to know,  is Ant going to be  every bit as harsh on Gene  as he was on Sarah Jessica Parker  and Bill Donahue?  Oh, boy.  Oh, more of our confrontations.  They never disrespected me.  We had a few confrontations.  One got me fired, but...  Oh.  Well, we're getting some advice  for your fight.  Dale in Minnesota.  Dale.  Anthony.  Yeah? 
[02:41:00]  What you've got to do  is just before you guys  don't get into it,  throw some pennies  on the board  and distract them.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Fuck you, Dale.  Punch it out.  All righty.  Throw some pennies  on the floor.  All right.  Apparently, that will  slow him down.  Let's go up to Queensbury  and...  Oh, where?  Matt, Queensbury.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hi, Matt.  Matt up to Queensbury.  I have a question for you, Ant.  Yes, sir.  Who are you going to root for  in a fight to the death between Gene Simmons and Barack Obama? 
[02:41:30]  Oh, good question.  I'd have to go with Barack.  He's younger.  He's in better shape because he goes to the gym and whatnot.  And you never bet on the white guy in a fight.  For the most part.  Wow, you must hate Gene.  Let's do that.  Keith in San Francisco.  Hey, guys.  Hey, faggot.  What's up, Keith?  I got a question for you.  What if he gives you the condescending,  well, then I'm sorry that it happened?  Yeah, what if there's an apology?  If there's an apology?  No, I don't accept an apology. 
[02:42:00]  Nice, nice.  Because he could have done that.  I like that.  That day.  No, no, and it wouldn't be sincere.  He'd never apologize.  He didn't apologize to his bandmates.  You know, I don't think we've ever played the actual clip of him saying,  maybe I'll fuck your girlfriend tonight.  Ooh, wow.  Can we find that?  Yeah, find Gene's tape and see what he actually said.  All right.  Because maybe I was wrong.  Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.  Maybe.  Maybe it's a big misunderstanding. 
[02:42:30]  Okay, here's Dr. Love.  No, he's not.  He needs a doctor to make fucking love.  Inject some adrenaline into that motherfucker.  This slow motion fucking asshole.  How does this song make you feel, Hank?  Seriously.  Don't hold back.  That's a pretty rockin' tune.  It sure is.  You know, how old is it?  How old is this song?  How old is this song?  1977.  31 years.  All right.  Yeah.  See?  Enough said.  Yeah.  Yeah?  There's like three Kiss songs I can tolerate. 
[02:43:00]  Say you like Beth, because he hates Beth.  Listen to this.  What's that voice?  It's awful.  I love it.  Looking back, it's awful.  I love this growing up, too, but come on.  Do they?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I'm fucking suing you for malpractice then, Dr. Love, because you stink.  All right, Greg. 
[02:43:30]  The doctor is out.  Greg.  Hey, boys.  Just calling this a quality Sirius XM broadcast today.  Worth every penny.  And, uh, Gregory, have a very nice weekend, sir.  Thank you, sir.  All the, uh, well wishes are greatly appreciated, by the way.  See, I'm not that much of an asshole.  They call me Dr. Wig.  It warms my heart.  All right, so we'll get the Gene Simmons conversation happening.  It'll end in fist fight, hopefully.  Whatever.  Or fake your getting held back fist fight. 
[02:44:00]  It's going to look like, uh, the hat removal fucking video when his hair goes flying.  Oh, my God.  How funny would that be?  Comes in with his fucking walker.  How funny would that be?  Oh.  Smash him.  How about they fucking turn the heat off in this fucking place?  Why, Jimmy?  It's 1,500 degrees in here.  It is very hot in here.  It's hot.  Jesus Christ.  The AC is out.  Oh, the AC is out.  Speaking of AC, we got AC DC's Angus Young.  Wow. 
[02:44:30]  So we got the Segway today.  That was a good Segway.  Thank you.  What?  All right, so why don't we take a quick break?  We get the commercial crap out of the way.  We come back.  We talk to Angus Young.  Okay, cool.  I like it.  That CD, Black Ice, is doing extremely well.  You can't really call it a CD anymore.  What are they called?  No, it is a CD.  Music Units.  What is it called?  Music Units.  Is it being sold online?  Maybe ACDC.com.  But out of habit, we're calling it a CD.  But let's be honest.  No one's buying CDs these days.  No, not really.  It's Music Units. 
[02:45:00]  You're just buying an electronic signal.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, wait.  I drew.  Yeah.  You're up.  That's the out?  Hit it.  Oh, shit.  Make my bitch up.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
[02:45:30]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
[02:46:00]  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Way to go, E-Rock.  Way to go, E-Rock.  Good job, E-Rock.  We have Drew Boogie in here.  Yeah, but just go with a regular rejoiner  that we play every fucking day.  Good job, Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  Very excited on our phone.  Why is he waiting?  He shouldn't wait at all.  Ladies and gentlemen, Angus Young.  Angus, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:46:30]  Morning, Opie.  Morning, Anthony.  How do we know it's you?  Who else would be here at this time?  Where are you, Angus?  Are you on the East Coast here in the States?  Yeah, they're playing the IZOT Center tonight.  Yeah, we're out in the, what do you call it?  Yeah, the IZOT Center.  Congratulations on the success.  I mean, Black Ice debuted at number one in 29,  I mean, 29 countries in number one.  That's mind-boggling.  It is, yeah.  What do you, are you guys going to go on iTunes or anything, 
[02:47:00]  or do you sell digitally on ACDC.com?  Do they sell digitally?  Like, do you guys download sales?  Because I know you guys have a big CD,  which is amazing to see you guys doing this kind of business with CDs.  Yeah.  Because so many people can't sell CDs anymore.  Mm-hmm.  And you guys are selling a shitload of them.  Yeah.  So are you doing digital downloads, or is it all CDs?  I think it's, at the moment, all CDs, I think.  I think they've got some sort of digital thing going. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, Angus doesn't keep track.  He just knows he's still doing very, very well in 29 countries.  That's right.  What country?  I just read the checks, you know.  Yeah.  There you go.  Angus, so you're number one in 29 countries.  What country surprised you?  What country surprised?  Well, what country is really into ACDC that you would think,  wow, why are they into my band?  Well, you just mentioned 29 of them, I think.  No, come on.  There's got to be one of those weird, like, countries  that just can't get enough of their ACDC. 
[02:48:00]  Like Pakistan or, like, you know, some West African country  where you wouldn't think that rock would be as accepted.  Yeah.  Well, I know we're on four stamps.  I can't work this one out.  Somewhere, out in Africa, there's a republic,  and, you know, they've got four stamps with ACDC on it.  That's hilarious.  ACDC probably spells somebody's name out there.  They don't even know stamps.  What in Nigeria? 
[02:48:30]  Well, BlackEye's just doing very, very well,  and SiriusXM gave you your own channel, the ACDC channel.  That's pretty exciting.  It is, it is, yeah.  It's a great way to promote it, too, because Metallica did it.  Zeppelin.  Zeppelin's got their own channel, and Elvis, and you guys.  I've heard of Elvis, yeah.  Yeah.  He's not doing the Eyes Eye Center, I'll tell you that much.  No, no, no.  Not these days.  Not doing well.  Hey, I've always wanted to ask you an odd question,  because I've been a fan for many years.  I mean, I think the first time I ever saw you play 
[02:49:00]  was watching For Those About to Rock, the video.  And you're one of the very few, like, guitarists  where watching you on stage is as recognizable  or more recognizable than the front man.  Do you ever get dizzy shaking your head like that?  Do I get dizzy?  Yeah.  I've been watching you for years,  and anyone that doesn't know Angus,  you just kind of stomp your feet  and you shake your head in a nodding motion  the entire night.  Yeah.  And that doesn't bother you at all? 
[02:49:30]  Well, I don't know.  Sometimes, yeah.  It's just hard remembering your name afterwards.  That's all.  You're brain damage.  I imagine you don't have any blockage, though.  You're shaking all that crap loose.  You must be a healthy man, Angus.  You ever go on stage under the influence?  Under the influence?  Yeah.  Of what?  That means yes.  Yeah.  Fucking Angus.  You guys are amazing, too,  because, I mean, it's like very few people,  I mean, obviously people know Bon Scott 
[02:50:00]  was the original lead singer from 74, I think, to 80.  Yeah.  And then he dies, and very few bands can lose such an important member  and then not only pick up, but then pick up with such a massive hit  as Back in Black.  And for anyone that isn't familiar with the band,  Brian Johnson, I mean, did you guys know him beforehand,  or how did he just become the fit, the guy to replace Bon?  Oh, Bon told us about him.  And one time Bon was telling me and Mal about, he'd been in England, Bon, 
[02:50:30]  and he'd been, when he was younger, touring with a band.  And the band he'd been touring with had opened for the band Brian was in.  And he saw him in a, he saw him in a play-in,  and he, Bon was telling us, he said, oh, yeah, he saw the, it was a great act.  He said, you know, this guy comes on, and then he said,  and then suddenly, you know, he just falls on the floor,  and he's screaming and rolling all over the place. 
[02:51:00]  He says, and the place was going wild, you know.  And he says, and then out comes his stretcher,  and they pick the guy up and put him on,  and carry him out.  And he says he thought it was the best ending, you know,  of an act he ever saw.  And it turns out, you know, years later,  Brian was saying, yeah, it's because I had appendicitis.  Nice.  That's the first time I heard about it.  Oh, wow.  And you guys haven't been on the road in, what is it, about seven years? 
[02:51:30]  That's about right, yeah, yeah.  Any reason?  Did you just need a break after a while, or do you get, like,  do you guys hit, like, I'm sure, like every other artist,  do you have, like, moments of creativity where you're like,  you want to create a new album, but you're getting stuck,  or how does that work for you?  Well, we had a lot of, you know, we had a bit of a,  because we change record companies,  so you've got a bit of a changeover, you know,  process that goes down.  You know, I won't bore you with the details of that,  but, so you have that going, but also you've got to, 
[02:52:00]  I think a lot of other things comes along, too.  You know, you, I mean, for the band, we just do what we normally do,  which is you come off the road and you have a few months off,  and then you just start writing songs again.  Right.  Yeah.  What's your favorite song to do live?  To do live?  Yeah.  Jeez, I'm spoiled for choice.  Wow.  I would think, well, I always like doing a lot of the,  you know, the up-tempo ones.  Sure.  Well, they're all up-tempo. 
[02:52:30]  We were discussing your band a couple days ago.  We noticed that you've never really done the power ballad there, Angus.  Oh, the ballad, right.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it's because everyone else does them, you know.  Right, yeah.  We don't get to use our lighters at an ACDC show.  The closest you guys came to a ballad was Big Balls.  Right.  I got Big Balls.  That's right, yeah.  Yeah, right on.  Another thing you guys have, now this is true, right?  You vowed to never put out a greatest hit CD?  A greatest hit?  A greatest tits. 
[02:53:00]  You guys don't have a greatest hit CD, do you?  No, not really, no.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll save that for later.  You know, I suppose probably live is the closest you get to hearing this kind of play,  or, you know, as much tracks as possible.  But I guess it's probably because we were not so much a, you know, a single kind of orientated  band, you know.  Well, I think it's also a great way to not gouge the fans.  I think it's like we put the material out. 
[02:53:30]  If you have the album, you have what you need.  It's like, I kind of like that, because a lot of bands just keep repackaging, or the record  companies, not the bands, the same eight, nine songs, and you guys haven't done that,  which I think is kind of nice that the fans don't keep getting roped into the same songs.  Yeah, absolutely.  Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside, Agassi writes, is it true that you lose around four pounds  a concert?  Now, if I did the math, I don't think that's true, because...  Well, the other night, my pants were falling down.  I was in, I think it was Philadelphia.  The reviews on the Philly show, unbelievable. 
[02:54:00]  They can't believe you're on the phone with us, because they just saw you, I guess, a  few nights ago down there?  That's right, yes.  They said it was, one guy said it was the best show he's ever seen.  Yeah, yeah.  That must have been my brother.  Signed, Brian J.  So, it's amazing, like, you guys have been around, I mean, at 74 you've been playing,  and to still be playing at the same high level, you know, I mean, you guys sell, how many albums  have you sold?  I think it was, we were reading the 10th biggest selling band of all time. 
[02:54:30]  All time, yeah.  Worldwide.  Is that right?  Yeah, and I mean, you fall under guys...  And that bank manager still doesn't let me in the front door, you know.  Dude, is that amazing?  I heard Keith Richards, or one of the Stones had a problem like that.  I don't know how you dress.  I imagine it's not in the schoolboy stage uniform when you go out.  Yeah.  But is it amazing to you when you go someplace, and they kind of maybe don't treat you the  way they should, because they just don't understand that you've sold 250 million records,  or whatever it is?  Story of my life.  Really? 
[02:55:00]  No respect.  Yeah.  After all that, right?  That's right.  Hey, Jimmy brings up the schoolboy outfit.  I heard that you tried a few different, like, costumes in the early days, and then you settled  on the schoolboy outfit.  That's right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are some of the ones where you went, oh, boy, that was a bad idea?  Well, one, they put me in a gorilla suit.  That was a bit much, you know, because I couldn't even see out of that one.  Yeah.  And then this manager who was looking after us at the time, he said, oh, I've got a great 
[02:55:30]  idea.  We'll fill the stage of, you know, dry ice, and, you know, we'll put Angus out there in  his gorilla suit, and we'll get Bond dressed like Tarzan, you know?  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  I think it's Bond, you know, he's up there scrambling on the PA system, and, you know,  he swings across the PA system, but what they didn't tell him was that, you know, the rope  was too long.  So he just went, he looked like Sylvester Cat, just going into a pilot. 
[02:56:00]  He just goes flying into the crowd.  That's awesome.  And there's me stuck in this gorilla suit with all this dry ice, and nobody could even  see it.  That's ridiculous.  Some of the things you do for art, you see?  Yeah, yeah, I guess so.  You've got to try different things until you figure it out, right?  Yeah, what gave you the inspiration for the schoolboy outfit? 
[02:56:30]  Because that really is just a, it's an odd look, and it's absolutely perfect and identifiable  as you.  Yeah.  What gave me the idea?  That was my sister.  You know, she came up with that.  She just said, why don't you try this?  And you were like, dad, that'll never work.  And you did it anyway, and all of a sudden, here you are, 35 years later.  Yeah, at first you think, yeah, you know, because as a kid, I hated school.  And, you know, I don't want to get into that.  Right.  That's the last thing.  But she kept saying, it'd be really cool. 
[02:57:00]  Nobody's done something like that before.  It's great, because you're one of the few rock stars that talk to you.  He really sounds like a rock star.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I sound like a rock star.  Yeah, but that's a good thing, though.  Like, you know, you're just kind of like, eh, whatever, man.  You know, it's just that that's the way a rock star should be.  You're like, fuck it all.  Whatever.  Now we're getting a review from the DC show.  People are very excited you're on the phone.  They said DC was unbelievable.  That was good. 
[02:57:30]  I remember that, yes.  Hey, there's somebody taking their son tonight.  It's going to be his first concert.  How does that make you feel to see different generations in the audience?  Yeah, well, that's a buzz, too, you know, because they see you for the first time.  So for you, it's a good thing, you know, because you wonder and you go, hey, I hope that you, you know, that, you know, because, you know, sometimes people brag and they say, oh, you've got to see this show.  And, you know, and the kids go, oh, yeah, you know, I used to do them. 
[02:58:00]  My brothers would say to me, oh, you've got to see this guy.  And I go, oh, yeah, here we go again, you know.  Sure.  So, you know, it's good that they bring them along.  What's your, when you were, when you were coming up and you started playing, what band was a big influence on you?  Or who did you, like, really idolize?  Who did I really idolize?  Well, I saw a few bands when I was young.  I saw the Stones when I was about nine.  And, you know, so don't show you how old those guys are.  Hey, brother Joe's on the line. 
[02:58:30]  It's Anthony's brother.  Joe, we're talking to Angus Young.  What's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey, Angus, how's it going, man?  Hey, Joe, how are you?  I'm good.  I'm good.  I have a question to ask about tribute bands.  I actually, I play in one that's a YouTube, you know, tribute.  And I was wondering how aware you guys are of ACDC tribute bands that are out there  and how many there are and if you've ever seen any of them. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, I saw one of the Hell's Bells, a girl band.  I saw them once, yes.  Okay.  Yeah, there's another one, ACDC.  There's another one.  ACDC?  Yeah, I've heard of them, too.  Somebody told me about them.  Yeah.  I know all the girl ones.  There's a love for one of them.  I'm not one of those people that discriminate.  Well, the girl ones.  I don't blame you.  I do that myself. 
[02:59:30]  But, yeah, there's a local one called Livewire that plays here off the island.  But they're nationwide.  They're actually worldwide at this point.  My good friend Chris plays with them.  I just wanted to find that out, man.  Thank you very much for the question, brother.  It's a good thing, yeah.  You like the tribute bands, Angus?  They're all right, right?  Yeah.  As long as they do a good job.  Anyone who can make a living at doing something, I'm happy for.  Do you walk up and say, like, hey, how you doing?  Like, watch them play and then watch them shit their pants when you walk up and say hi?  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:00:00]  That would be pretty funny.  Hey, you suck.  Dude, here's what you got to do.  You got to go to one of those tribute shows and then just stand up front and start booing  and turn the crowd on them.  Wow, that would work.  Oh, just all their fans would throw shit at them.  Just at the end, you'd say, like, come on, I was goofing.  After they're pummeled.  Yeah, after their equipment's been smashed.  Or just yell, where's...  Okay, come on, get a real job.  Yeah.  Put still in our shit, boo.  Just yell, where's my cut? 
[03:00:30]  What's that guy doing in my suit?  Fucking Angus rules.  You know what's amazing, too, man?  You guys survived, like, the...  Everything.  Every...  Every genre, every...  Every fad.  Yep.  You guys have blown right through all of them.  Like, you stayed from the mid-70s up through the fucking hair bands, up through grunge and  all that stuff.  And you guys never stopped selling out arenas, which is really amazing.  You know why?  Because you guys stayed true to yourselves. 
[03:01:00]  I mean, it always sucked when you had a favorite band and all of a sudden they experimented with  rap or something because that was popular.  Or you guys just said, fuck that.  We're doing what we know and we're going to continue and we'll find our audience.  That's right, yeah, yeah.  You say it so well.  Well, I was...  I was going to take a shot at Rush because they did that Roll the Bones rap song.  I'm like, what are you doing?  You don't need to do this just because rap is kind of popular now.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, do you have a riff, dude, as a guitarist, do you have a riff that you've written? 
[03:01:30]  Like, obviously, Fred Nugent, he talks about Cat Scratch Fever.  Do you have a riff that you've written that you just play sometimes and go, I can't fucking  believe I wrote that?  Yeah, well, I get it.  Probably nearly all the time.  It's probably something like Highway to Hell.  Yeah.  You're just really proud of that every time you play it?  Not that you're not proud of the other stuff, but that's just one that really gets you.  Like, I can't believe this is my work.  Yeah, yeah.  I think the ones that get you, if you've got a track, you just hit a chord or two and  they know it automatically.  Oh, my God. 
[03:02:00]  How great is that feeling?  Yeah.  Highway to Hell.  Yeah.  Rules.  What do you listen to nowadays besides, I mean, you probably don't listen to your own  stuff other than to mix it.  What do you listen to?  Same old stuff than what I grew up on.  Yeah.  I still get a big kick if I hear an old Chuck Berry song.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you guys do any of those covers when you're doing your live shows just to have a little  fun?  What do you mean live on stage?  I don't know.  Maybe you redo a Chuck Berry song. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, do you go down that road?  I don't really know.  Nah, we just be, probably if we're playing about in the rehearsal or something, we fool  around a few old tunes.  Yeah.  But nothing like live.  Live, it's all your own.  Because even Metallica did a few, you know, they'd throw in a couple of occasionally a couple  of covers, turn the page or something.  I'm so stupid, I actually thought they wrote it.  I didn't know Seager did it first.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah, Seager did a pretty good job of that song.  So tonight, you guys, the website's obviously acdc.com, the new CD is Black Ice, and it's 
[03:03:00]  only being sold in select stores here, I think.  Walmart exclusively or something?  Walmart, Sam's Club, and acdc.com, you can get them from.  It's hard to find a CD these days.  You really can't walk around New York and find a CD store.  You just can't do it anymore.  Which makes it even more...  Maybe it's the best buy action, but whatever.  It makes it even more amazing that you guys are number one in so many countries. 
[03:03:30]  In the age of digital, the fact that you're doing that with CDs is mind-boggling.  And tonight in New Jersey, they're at...  For those of you that...  I didn't know what the IZOT Center was.  It's the old Continental Airlines arena.  It's the Meadowlands.  Yeah, that's what I always know it as, the Meadowlands.  You know, you blink, and then they've got a new name, and they tell you.  I had the same...  It's like they're saying in Boston.  You know, in Boston, they say, oh, this is now...  And it's got some big title.  Yeah, the Boston Garden was then the Fleet Center, and then... 
[03:04:00]  And then it becomes something else.  And that bank goes bust, and then...  Yeah, and I always knew it as the Boston Garden.  Of course.  You know, it's like Madison Square Garden.  You know, it is Madison Square Garden.  If they turned around and called it, you know, some glorious kind of name that none of us...  Usually none of us can pronounce it.  They've actually done that with some of the places inside the garden.  Like, they've made smaller rooms in there, and then they named those things after banks and companies and... 
[03:04:30]  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Angus, are you speeding, or what?  I hear the cops behind you.  You all right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You all right?  It's the kind of hotels that at least day is.  After all these years, come on!  You've got to get a five-star hotel there, Angus.  It's time.  Nice neighborhood.  It's time to enjoy your life a little bit.  That's right, yeah.  Hey, what kind of route do you come from?  I'm a Sabbath freak, and, you know, I know that all four of the guys come from real, real working-class routes and really broken Birmingham. 
[03:05:00]  What kind of a place did you come from?  Did you come from a good upbringing, or was it like kind of a rough and tumble area?  Yeah, well, I think they come from the ritzy side of life, then, compared to where I come from.  Oh, really?  Yeah, well, I come from Fernando.  I was born in Scotland, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  So I was born in an industrial town.  Glasgow is the name of it.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Did you play any of that golf?  Any what golf?  Only presidents get to play golf. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, have you changed a lot with all the money and the success?  Are you now a complete gentleman, or are you kind of just like the same fucking dude that you were, you know, 30 years ago?  Hey, I'm pretty much that, you know?  Nowadays, though, they say, hey, that guy's got manners, you know?  Yeah.  So it shows you how, man, it's not that you've changed, the rest of the world changed again.  Hey, that guy's got manners.  Yeah.  You notice any...  What, he's not mugging his own eyes?  Muck.  Have you noticed any big changes, since you haven't been on the road in so long, things 
[03:06:00]  you have to do now that were a little different than when the last time you toured?  I think it's just that, you know, everything gets that much faster, I think.  Yeah.  And when you're younger, you know, and when we started, there wasn't as much, well, you  know, stuff out there, you know?  I mean, when I first come to America, I think you would talk to about three magazines, you  know, maybe a small amount of radios, you know, there wasn't that much, you know, I suppose 
[03:06:30]  the media thing, you know?  But nowadays, it's just so much, so much more.  And equipment-wise, I mean, that's got to be a pleasure for you, you know, not having  to deal with so much mucky-muck on the stage.  Yeah, well, that's also a good deal, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a video I saw of you, and I want to know if it's like an ACDC-sanctioned DVD  or something, it's you guys, it's a very powerful version of Thunderstruck. 
[03:07:00]  You guys are, I think, opening a show with it, and it's like, there's got to be 70,000  people, and it's like, you know the other version I mean?  Absolutely.  Thunderstruck's one of my favorites.  And do you know, the video I'm talking about is the guys are coming out, and the crowd is  moving.  It's almost like there's 10 people standing on a piece of metal, and you're bouncing them.  It's just moving in rhythm to the opening of Thunderstruck.  It looks like Nuremberg.  Oh, my God, yeah.  It's like, is that a DVD you guys put out, or is that just a YouTube video? 
[03:07:30]  No, it is a DVD.  It's out there, yeah.  Do you know what that's called?  Because I actually want to get it.  I think that one's, let's see, Live at Donington, I think it is.  Oh, Donington.  All right, very good.  I know you're a busy man, we've got to let you go, but Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they  finally inducted you in 2003.  Gee, thanks.  Yeah, that's right.  What the fuck, though?  We bitch about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame all the time.  Were you guys eligible before that?  How many years? 
[03:08:00]  Wait, 74, 84, 90?  So they made you wait, what, four years?  What do you mean?  How long did we have to wait to be in that?  Yeah, I know there's a 25-year after your first album, which I'm thinking for you guys,  was that 74?  I think, yeah, yeah.  So you had to wait.  1999, I think, would have been your first year of eligibility.  I'm kind of rushed on the map.  That's what I'm getting at.  Stupid.  Yeah, I think they asked us in 2000 and something, 2003 or something, I think. 
[03:08:30]  Sabbath had to wait 10 years.  Isn't that awful?  Yeah, yeah.  I think, yeah, well, I think they have a kind of screening or something, you know?  Yeah.  They do, but when they let bands like...  But we weren't, when we were asked at first, because we said, you know, they were trying  to explain it to us, you know?  And I thought they were talking about baseball, you know?  And I said, wait, wait, what have we got to do with baseball? 
[03:09:00]  Hey, Jim Brewer talks highly of you, Angus.  Huh?  Jim Brewer?  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, Jim's one of our friends, and he can't get enough of you and ACDC, man.  He loves you.  Hmm.  But, all right, let's let you go.  You've got a big show tonight.  It's the IZOD Center.  Yep.  The old metal hands, like Jimmy said.  Yep.  ACDC, of course.  The new album's Black Ice.  In stores now, ACDC.com.  You've got your own channel on satellite.  You don't even have to call us there, Angus. 
[03:09:30]  That's right, yeah.  Sirius 29XM53 has the ACDC channel.  And you guys, thanks for calling, man.  And you guys have never sold out.  You've never changed what you do.  And you never douched the fans.  It's great to see you guys back out on the road.  Okay.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  All right, man.  Have a great show, Angus.  Thanks a lot.  Okay.  Thanks, Obi, Anthony.  Thank you, man.  What a pleasure.  Thank you, Angus.  Yeah.  Angus Young, everyone, from ACDC.  How do you not love him?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  I just want to talk like him all day now. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, I'm just talking like that all day.  That's it.  That's all we're going to do.  Yeah.  Who wouldn't want to just fucking hang out and chat with him for hours?  Yeah, maybe drink a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Great.  What a fucking cool rock star motherfucker.  That's cool.  To have to listen to him, a cool guy, rock star like that, and then watch this asshole on television.  Economy in crisis.  Gene Simmons, entrepreneur, is now talking. 
[03:10:30]  Ugh.  What happened, Gene?  Shut up.  Yeah, that's a nice little what?  Juxtaposition.  Yeah, we'll go with juxtaposition.  Yeah.  I got to apologize to Fatso, by the way, because he was trying to do the right thing, and we  trash him.  Oh, E-Rock coming in back with ACDC.  He came from the new album, Black Ice, which would have been a perfect, like, wow, this  is blah, blah from Black Ice, and speaking of which, here's Angus, but instead I yell  at him and say, we have Drew Boogie in studio. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, I thought you knew what he was doing.  It's always good to err on the side that he's a douche.  He doesn't mess up as much, though.  I didn't really know.  He fucking was trying to do the right thing.  You head your bet and just say, he's fucking up.  And I'm like, way to go, E-Rock.  Yeah, he's on the phone.  Yeah, Drew Boogie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Drew Boogie.  I said that Drew Boogie stuff was pretty good.  We just always.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We just always step in shit.  I step in shit once. 
[03:11:30]  It was 1981.  We was doing it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, we got the Gene Simmons clip.  Guy fucking rules.  Should we take a break and then do the Gene Simmons clip?  That's what we do.  Give me a little break, an easy one.  Yeah, five seconds.  All right, we'll do Drew first.  That was a nice break.  Welcome back.  Welcome to Ted and Friends.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, it was wonderful. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank you, thank you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Still gets turned away at the bank and stuff.  Got a lot of that.  Yeah, yeah, well.  There he goes.  We'll let you know at the time of hotels we still in the same way.  Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He sounds like either like...  The Penguin from Batman.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, he's got the Penguin happening and like an old school gangster too, actually.  Yeah, yeah, see?  Well, Muggsy, take the boys and throw them out.  Yeah, that smoker's cough. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking guy.  All I want to do is listen to him talk.  Great.  He fucking rules and, you know, he hung in there.  He did 20 minutes with us.  How cool is that?  If I wasn't flying today, I would absolutely go fucking see...  God damn it, do I want to go see ACDC tonight badly.  I'm playing everywhere.  You'll get a chance somewhere else.  I'm zipping around town.  Yeah.  I'm going from Queens to LaGuardia.  That's how I do it.  In Queens too.  Boo.  Uh, boo. 
[03:13:00]  Boo.  Boo.  Boo, boo, boo.  I suck.  I fucking bombed your bum, motherfucker.  I think you just bombed a joke, Jimmy.  Just the greatest.  Fucking ACDC.  Still going fucking strong.  Hell yeah.  All right, Drew.  Get us out for just a quickie here.  Happy, happy.  Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy. 
[03:13:30]  Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy 
[03:14:00]  Happy, happy, happy, happy, joy, enjoy.  Go home and get your fucking shine box.  Anthony has left the program. 
[03:14:30]  Let's give it up for Drew Boogie.  Come on, come on, come on.  Get fucking managed, fuck fucking managed, fuck fucking managed, fuck fucking managed.  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  What's all up in, in, in, in, in, in, in. 
[03:15:00]  Can you make this a song right here?  Oh no, that was almost a mistake.  Daddy almost had a mishap.  Oh shit.  Good job, Drew.  Oh god, Jimmy just stunk the whole place up pretty good. 
[03:15:30]  No, I didn't.  Yeah, you did.  Oh god, yeah, the heat is stifling.  God bless the heat.  Heat rules.  Heat owns.  We finally got the Gene Simmons clip that Anthony has been referring to.  You have officially called out Gene Simmons.  We got the official Anthony calls out Gene Simmons promo that will be on the channel shortly, hopefully.  Yeah.  And we'll see how this ends.  Yes.  And you swear you're not going to back down.  Ow.  You do know he's the God of Thunder, though.  I care less the God of Thunder. 
[03:16:00]  How do you fight the God of Thunder, my friend?  Explain that one.  I'll shut him down.  Don't you worry about it.  But he's the God of Thunder.  The God of Thunder was just on the MSNBC looking like a douche.  Right.  Looking like an asshole.  Yeah.  Entrepreneur.  Gene Simmons.  No, it's Kiss Sellout Guy.  Yeah.  What has he done?  What has he done that didn't involve just selling that fucking, squeezing every dime 
[03:16:30]  he could out of that Kiss name?  How is that an entrepreneur?  You put the fucking logo on a lunchbox?  You make a Kiss coffin?  Kiss credit cards?  That's being an entrepreneur?  No, that's being a whore.  Look at this hand.  Yeah?  Just a little.  Because you don't have, look over here, just over here.  Just showing your top secret stuff.  I can't see that.  Don't keep bending over.  What is it?  I can't see it.  Hold on, hold on.  I like secrets. 
[03:17:00]  Hold on, hold on.  Don't tell those secrets.  Keep it to yourself.  Wait, wait.  I'm going to write it for you.  What's going on?  What's the secret?  Pop him in the shitter while he's bent over like that.  I couldn't read it.  All right, bend over again.  No, I don't want to be popped in the shitter.  No, here's what you got to do.  I'm going to show you a game.  It's called Hide the Eel in the Cave.  I don't know.  Hold on.  This works.  Hold on.  Do some push-ups in there. 
[03:17:30]  This is just same old shit.  Just a different year.  Fuck you.  All right.  So we got the original.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like how?  I don't know.  To hear how.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What happened?  I can't say, Jimmy.  I like secrets.  Is it about me?  Well, yeah.  No.  You got us.  Gene Simmons, this is how it went down originally.  So people can be up to speed.  Maybe we could add this to the official Anthony calling out Gene Simmons promo. 
[03:18:00]  All right?  Yes.  This is the original comment.  What do you do for pleasure?  What?  I intend on fucking your girlfriend tonight.  I don't know.  Hey.  Whoa.  Wait a minute now.  I mean that as a term of endearment.  You actually probably just met her over at Channel 11.  Who?  Oh, Jill.  Yes.  Yes.  No, I'm fucking with you.  But the point I'm making.  The point I'm making.  All of a sudden he looked at me with a little more respect. 
[03:18:30]  I like that.  I'm not at all concerned with respect.  I really am not.  Apparently not.  Wow.  That's the original thing.  That bastard.  It sounded like you guys were getting along to me.  See?  Because he knew.  And I didn't.  So I was just like, ah, ha, ha, ha.  You know.  Oh.  Oh.  You see how he sounded like that?  He knew.  He knew.  All right.  Gene.  We'll wait for the next chapter. 
[03:19:00]  Go blow.  Uh, this girl will not stop calling.  Deanna, New Jersey.  How are you?  Hi, guys.  I'm good.  How are you?  Hi, sweetie.  Wow.  What is that?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I just want to tell you guys have the K-Rock girls on the other station.  Can you guys have, like, the virus girls?  They are.  They're called girls I fuck. 
[03:19:30]  Because I wanted to be a K-Rock girl, but I can't.  Why?  Are you too fat?  No, I'm not 21.  Oh, how old are you?  I'm 19.  Ugh, yuck.  All right.  Send a picture.  Why?  Send a picture.  You don't have to be 21 to be a Norton's girls.  I actually have a Norton's girls.  They bring me out on stage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I really think you guys should make the virus girls, and I should be one of them.  All right.  That was what that deserved.  Indifference.  Complete indifference.  How does it feel to get indifference, Jimmy? 
[03:20:00]  It's very typical.  And normally, like, everything is as it was yesterday.  What would a virus girl do?  Yeah.  That's right.  Go to Anthony's house.  What's that?  Hold on.  Turn your mic on.  What's that?  Go to Anthony's house.  I heard you.  I knew that was coming.  Oh, he fucking teeth first right into it.  All eager.  Go ahead, Deanna.  Sell yourself.  Yeah.  Sell yourself.  Exactly.  All right.  I'm 5'2", 100 pounds. 
[03:20:30]  I have long blonde hair, green eyes.  A job at a chocolate factory.  I'm a lunar girl.  If you're 5'2", that means you're really about 5'0".  Hey, Jimmy, your favorite person's on TV.  Look at that fucking...  Look at that jowly fat head.  We'll get back to you.  What is going on with his fucking shit?  He's trying to look like a gentleman.  Al Roker.  Why do they have Al Roker on TV?  It's MSN obesity.  That was good. 
[03:21:00]  Haven't you done the weather already?  Look at him.  I like the fact that he has fucking his jaw, but under it is a bunch of neck skin going  neck fat.  That's actually not the Dow.  That's his weight fluctuating as he's sitting there.  Yes.  Depending on how much Fatso sweats during the interview.  Oh, he bugs me.  Oh, I love your Al Roker chapter, too, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I just go over his blog and stuff and address him. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, you just rip him apart.  Yeah.  Line by line.  Yeah, let his own words roll him.  All right, Deanna, we're bored with you.  Thanks.  His gums are creeping up his teeth and it's bothering me.  Your fucking gummy mouth is bothering me.  His gummy mouth.  He must hate flossing.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Jeff Goldblum.  What do we got on this, Danny?  He's an actor.  Well.  Oh, no.  We started this with the...  With the Grape Lady Family Guy, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then we started talking about how Seth Green...  Excuse me, not Seth Green.  Yeah, yeah.  Seth from Family Guy, whatever his name is. 
[03:22:00]  I can't remember now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's doing these comedy shorts on YouTube that are sponsored by Burger King, where it kind  of looks like Family Guy characters, but it's not exactly Family Guy, but it's Seth's  own brand of humor.  I am definitely going to want to hear the fucking Al Roker.  Oh, shit.  Along with ATF agents during bust.  He does a ride-along.  He's saying that someone dies of gunshots every 18 minutes in this country?  Yeah, apparently.  Hey, how many are justified?  Oh, boy.  Now you're going to have to fight Al Roker now, too. 
[03:22:30]  It's his report.  ATF?  I don't know if he's with the ATF.  A tub of fat.  Jimmy, because I go back to your chapter, still not getting respect.  His report will air on MSNBC Sunday night at 10 o'clock.  Oh, that's real important, Al, huh?  Boy, that's in-depth reporting.  Way to get the prime time, Al.  That's where all the hard-hitting news guys put their specials.  That's when they have the prison bitches specials. 
[03:23:00]  Fucking Al Roker.  Thanks.  Every 18 minutes, someone dies from gun violence in the U.S.  That's not a lot.  It looks like an impressive stat, but it's not that.  It's not a lot.  No.  How many is that an hour?  Every 18 minutes?  A little over three.  A little over three an hour.  That's, what, 72 people a day.  That's impossible.  72 people a day are dying from guns.  Okay.  Yeah, that sounds reasonable.  But then you've got 50 states, so a little over one per state. 
[03:23:30]  Then you've got a lot of towns in the states.  Eh.  What are the odds?  Eh.  More people buy cars.  Oh, yeah.  No, not buy.  You know, B-Y, buy.  Not B-Y.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Oh, well, of course.  Why don't we, what don't we, what don't we, what don't we, what don't we.  What's the big hullabaloo?  We're going to do, what did we learn on the OPN Anthem show?  What happened to Jeff Goldblum?  Yeah, we're doing that.  So, the Jeff Goldblum selling wafer thing?  Yeah, it's really weird.  It's kind of weird. 
[03:24:00]  When I saw it for the first time, I kind of didn't know what to make of it, so.  Oh, shit.  So, this is going to be a waste of time?  No, I don't know.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's.  It sucks.  It's different.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's us wasting a minute.  Hi, I'm Jeff Goldblum.  Guess what I'm selling?  Wrong again.  Jeff Goldblum wafers.  The only cracker that talks when you put it in your mouth.  Now, each cracker looks like a tiny Jeff Goldblum, and it makes scintillating conversation.  Is that Brie?  Oh, I love Brie.  I once dated a girl named Brie. 
[03:24:30]  She was very lithe.  Oh, you're eating me.  That tickles.  Your mouth smells like black licorice.  You know, the twisty kind?  Now, before you swallow, did you see No Country for Old Men?  It was stunningly bleak, darkly intimate, and most of all, human.  Now, you see, you won't hear Triscuit make that kind of conversation, although they are crisp.  I'll have to give them that.  They're very crispy.  Where was I?  Oh, yes.  Buy Jeff Goldblum wafers.  Or don't. 
[03:25:00]  But I would prefer it if you did.  Although, let's face it, one can't always get what one desires.  Still, that's no reason not to try.  Yes, yes.  You know something?  That's a pretty good Jeff Goldblum.  I'll tell you who does Jeff Goldblum.  And I mean...  To a T?  Fucking...  To a T.  To a fucking JG.  Oh, wow.  Elon Gold does Jeff Goldblum...  Really?  ...better than Jeff Goldblum?  No, only Jeff does him as good as Jeff. 
[03:25:30]  No.  Find that on YouTube, maybe.  See, if you find Elon doing Jeff, that motherfucker looks like him.  I forget what he does, but...  Not really.  What's that?  He looks like him too.  And does the impression of the face, the eyes.  Everyone does Barry Katz.  He does the best Barry Katz.  Elon's a funny dude, man.  Why don't we have him on the show?  He's a big Howard guy.  He actually did the Howard impression.  He's been on...  Doesn't mean we wouldn't have mom, but this probably happened.  That inane conversation of Jeff Goldblum is what made that funny.  Like, that is totally the way he is. 
[03:26:00]  You see him on talk shows?  He just babbles.  Man's a fool.  I don't know what he's saying.  I told you, though.  I mean, he's a fan of mine.  Oh, Jeff Goldblum is a fan of yours?  Well, he likes to be on a tough crowd.  And he goes, what was that show hosted by a tough crowd?  He's been on the show.  We've talked to Jeff.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, we did have him on the phone.  Yeah, yeah.  On the phone, I think.  He said he listened to the show.  Yes, yes, yes.  And he didn't remember Colin's name when I met him, which made me really happy.  Oh, right, right, right, right. 
[03:26:30]  Where's my Imus picture?  Why don't we do, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  We have Elon?  Yeah, I do have a clip here.  Doing Goldblum?  What do you want me to do?  Pop this fucker up.  We put it on the TV.  Others.  What do I do?  Pop it up.  TTP, which has been reported rarely, sometimes in less than two weeks after fighting therapy.  Oh, that guy can't get a boner.  That's pretty good.  He does look like him.  Thanks for being here, Jeff.  How are you?  I'm good.  I'm very good, but also exhilarated. 
[03:27:00]  Yes, yes.  I feel free.  Like Sam, the world.  Look at me.  Let's go.  Catch me if you can.  Well, you look great.  I got to tell you.  What's your secret?  Well, I just try to stay out of the moon.  Really?  I always heard about the sun being bad for you, but...  Oh, oh, the sun is not good for you.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But a moon worse.  Yes.  You see, reflective light is dangerous, but a refractive fatal. 
[03:27:30]  That's all the way to him.  So I understand you're returning to Broadway.  You know, the moon is also responsible for the tides, feminine cycles, and, of course,  where would the werewolf be without it?  Again, all valuable information, Jeff, but I think we've covered the moon.  Would you be comfortable moving on?  Hmm.  Yes, of course.  That's my close heel focusing.  You've heard of ADD. 
[03:28:00]  Yes, of course.  But I have ASD, attention surplus disorder.  I focus on everything.  Too much for too long.  Must be a terrible burden living with that.  No.  Actually, it can be a great blessing.  Some of the greatest inventors of all time had ASD.  In fact, if I may indulge, I'm doing a one-man show about the greatest inventor of all time, 
[03:28:30]  Thomas Alva Edison.  Oh, cool.  And I understand you're going to do a piece of that here for us?  The pleasure is all ours.  This is going to be good.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a real treat.  Jeff Goldblum is Thomas Edison.  He does look like him, too.  The face, the eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  He sounds great.  I had an idea. 
[03:29:00]  It was like a light bulb went off in my head, but not a light bulb, because I hadn't yet invented it.  Ironically, it was the idea for the light bulb.  My name is Thomas Edison.  I hail from Menlo Park.  I was sick and tired of living in the dark.  I'll take a piece of tungsten and twist it just like so. 
[03:29:30]  And before you know it, you will start to glow.  So, screw Ben Franklin and his kite, because Uncle Tommy invented light.  They'll remember us when we're gone.  He was a little more visual.  I was the first guy to do it. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, you gotta see it.  That's pretty damn good, man.  He sounds exactly like that.  But, his butt.  Yeah.  Elon Gould interviewing...  No, Gould.  Elon Gould.  Oh, yeah.  Why did I say Gould?  Elon Gould interviewing Elon as Jeff Goldblum.  Yeah, he does all the parts in that flying comedy bit.  I'm sure there's none of him doing...  He did, I think, on Chappelle's show, he did Barry Katz, because Chappelle was managed by Barry years ago. 
[03:30:30]  So, Barry at one time had everybody.  You could tell how he would do a great Barry.  You could just tell.  But Chappelle does a bit where he's pushing someone, a manager down the steps in a wheelchair.  Oh, that was Elon?  I think that was Elon doing Barry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's good.  Doing Barry.  I would love to...  How amazing is it that people insist on doing Barry when no one knows what Barry looks or sounds like?  He just...  He has this amazing way of...  He's just a complete character.  Yeah.  That's why it works, even if you don't know who the guy is.  But Elon's Barry is...  I've heard them all do it. 
[03:31:00]  I've heard fucking...  Frank Caliendo does a good Barry.  A bunch of them do a good Barry.  Mm-hmm.  What's Barry Katz?  Is that Elon?  No.  No.  That's Dr. Barry Katz.  All right.  Why don't we do...  What did we learn on the Hopin' Anthony show?  No.  Do we have the plug, and do we have the new intro?  Oh, you want the plug?  Oh, no.  What did you ask for the plug?  All right.  What's the plug for what did we learn on the Hopin' Anthony show?  Oh. 
[03:31:30]  Tomorrow night.  Friday, I mean.  Tomorrow I'll be on the show.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Friday.  Friday night.  Yeah.  I'll be...  At the cop.  And I'm hoping that people...  Oh, poor Jimmy.  ...Custis Ballroom and Caesar...  ...tickets from Ticketmaster.com. 
[03:32:00]  7 p.m. show on Friday.  Friday.  And to celebrate Dr. King's birthday...  Uh-huh.  Martin Luther...  King Jr. that was...  ...that would be...  ...January 16th, 17th...  ...I'll be at the Borgata.  Oh, yeah.  Borgata.  The Borgata in Atlantic City.  And tickets are on theborgata.com.  And, look, if you care about D.C.  December 5th, I'll be at the State Theater in Falls Church, Virginia. 
[03:32:30]  And...  ...I'll do it one night there.  Bend over again.  No, I don't want to get poked in the shitter.  We're not poking you in the shitter.  Can I read it?  I need you to read this.  No.  I can't read from here.  It's a secret, Jimmy.  I won't tell the one.  All right.  Bend over.  Jimmy, get me in the shitter.  No, no.  Don't get me in the shitter.  Hold on.  Can you read that?  I can't read it.  What's wrong?  All right, here.  Look.  What'd I do?  Oh, that'll break.  Just read that. 
[03:33:00]  I'm trying.  Wait.  Maybe if I...  A little bit?  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Well...  There you go.  Can't get...  Oh.  It's...  It's not a secret.  It just says, look, fucking Friday night, November 21st.  Comedy Festival, Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Jim Norton, 7 o'clock.  That's all it says.  Chelsea Handler, too, I heard in there, Jimmy.  Tomorrow I'm doing Chelsea.  Sure. 
[03:33:30]  All right.  So what did we learn?  WebEx.com is the sponsor of this.  Rest in line today for just a little bit, changing it up.  WebEx.com.  Hold meetings, make presentations, do it from the comfort of your own home or office.  Check it out at WebEx.com.  If you love the show, just go there and give them some attention, please.  WebEx.com.  Thank you.  Here comes...  What did we learn? 
[03:34:00]  What did we learn?  All right.  Let's go to John on Long Island.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show, John?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned Anthony officially, quote-unquote, called out Gene Simmons.  Yes.  And?  He still hasn't told us how he's going to fight the God of Thunder.  We're waiting.  I could totally fight the God of Thunder.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What were some of those other Kiss songs, Jimmy? 
[03:34:30]  Calling Dr. Love.  We did the Dr. Love thing.  There was Great Expectations.  There was She.  There was Parasite.  There was Rock and Roll All Night and Party Every Day.  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  There was Bet.  There I Was Made for Loving You.  There was I Stole Your Love.  There was Christine 16.  How about that one, Anthony?  I Stole Your Love.  Well, he didn't.  He thought he was going to.  There was Love Them, Leave Them. 
[03:35:00]  Uh-huh.  There was Mr. Speed.  There was Tomorrow and Tonight.  How do you know so many Kiss songs that no one gives a flying fuck about?  Thank you, man.  There was Detroit Rock City.  There was King of the Nighttime.  Well, there was.  How many actual Kiss songs do you think the average, like, listener of rock music knows?  There was Shout It Out Loud.  There was Black Diamond.  I give you Shout It Out Loud.  I'll give you a.  I would go with less than 10.  Definitely less than 10.  The average person that calls themselves a Kiss fan would only be able to name 10 Kiss 
[03:35:30]  songs.  No, I'm not even talking Kiss fan.  I'm just talking people that, like, know music.  There was Deuce.  Just, like, listen to rock music.  There was Strutter.  Oh, my God.  I'm saying.  There was Shock Me.  Three?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You got it.  I went to a Kiss show years ago, and I was, like, psyched about it until I realized I don't  know any fucking Kiss songs.  I know, like, three.  There was Flaming Youth.  There was Sweet Pain. 
[03:36:00]  Let's say hi to tears.  There was Do You Love Me?  Tears in Ohio.  What did you learn?  Hi, tears in Ohio.  How are you?  Hey.  There was 100,000 Years.  Tears.  Help me.  There was Watching You.  Tears.  I learned that Stunt Brain doesn't know how to go with a bit.  There was Rock Bottom.  Stunt Brain doesn't know how to go with a bit.  Yeah.  Yeah, true.  Rock Bottom.  There was All-American Man.  There was Rocket Ride.  Rocket Ride.  The fuck is that? 
[03:36:30]  That one, you'll feel very bad about not loving.  It is an Ace Frehley classic.  And Ace was the coolest one of the whole band.  Was he?  Yes.  And he was also the one that got fucked over the most.  Ace would always walk up to the mic just in time to hit his fucking Time to Sing.  Ace stayed away from the mic until it was Time to Sing.  Yeah.  And then it was like, Time to Sing!  And then he would just sing.  Right.  Ace, Rocket Ride, fucking rules.  Did you ever get scared that Ace wasn't going to get to the mic in time?  Every time I watch him. 
[03:37:00]  I saw him at the Hard Rock and in Cleveland.  Yeah.  And I was like, He'll never make it.  Sing!  And he never rushed.  He's in no rush to get there.  No hurry!  That's awesome.  He's Ace!  God bless him.  Fuck yeah.  Let's say hi to Jay, Jay.  Yeah.  Hey.  I learned today that Anthony taught me that Gene Simmons has to take a Viagra to pee. 
[03:37:30]  Did we learn that today, Ant?  Look, I didn't say anything about him needing Viagra.  I just said from the videotape, it looks like he's the lousiest fuck out there.  There you go.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  He talks about what a great romancer he is.  And, ugh.  Hey, guys.  All right.  Good evening, Rob.  Yeah, yeah.  I learned that Uncle Paul's...  Well, actually, I'll tell you what I learned, then I got a question for Anthony.  No.  I learned that Uncle Paul's last name is Hargis. 
[03:38:00]  You didn't know my name is Paul Hargis.  Hargis.  How do you spell Hargis again, Uncle Paul?  H-A-R-G-I-U-S and the U is silent.  Anthony, I'm a big avid poker player.  I play a lot.  I was just curious if, you know, the next time you're having a poker tournament at your place  or anywhere, you know, nearby, if you'd be, you know, kind enough to let me play your game 
[03:38:30]  because, you know, I would love to...  Well, absolutely.  Oh, sorry.  You were hung up on.  Matt, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned Angus Young used to dress like a hat remover on stage.  John in Boston.  John?  Yeah, today I learned that Jim Norton is the heir to a railroad fortune.  Yeah, we did learn that.  What?  We figured out, Jim.  Heir to a railroad fortune.  Think about it.  Think about it.  Think about it.  Think about it. 
[03:39:00]  Think about it.  That's how I think.  I make a little bunny noise.  People hate what I'm thinking.  What?  What?  Oh, my father had a Lionel.  Right.  Train set.  Yeah.  My dad's only...  Inheritance.  My dad's thing.  Yeah.  He inherited Lionel trains from his dad, his grandfather.  Right.  And he has them.  I break them when he's not looking.  John in Buffalo.  Just snap them over my knee and laugh.  Hey, boys, I've learned two things today.  Yes, sir.  One is the only thing gayer than being in the U.S. Navy is being in the Indian Navy 
[03:39:30]  and that Mr. Faber-Sham is the one who's behind the Nigerian scans.  All right.  We're going to bring back Lionel today.  We're going to bring back Lionel today.  That was so bad.  It didn't make sense.  Why would Mr. Faber-Sham be in charge of the...  It didn't...  Like, what...  I know, sir.  Why don't you just throw a wet bag of shit at the wall and go, that... 
[03:40:00]  Can I tell you...  Can I take you inside the show, too?  I saved that guy from bombing probably six times I hung up on him today.  Because then they screen the calls and then we hang up on some of you guys.  It's like, we're either moving on and we can't be polite.  You've got to keep the show going.  I saw that come up a couple of times.  I hung up on the guy saving him a bombing and he just didn't get the hint.  And he finally got through.  And there you go.  Mickey, Long Island.  Hey, I learned today if your tank is full of marshmallows, you'll probably be okay. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, we did learn that.  I threw you into a girl's drink once.  Oh, my God.  Bobby Big Ringer.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Bobby, are you hauling today?  What am I hauling?  I got mozzarella cheese.  Why?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why?  That cheese.  Like a whole truck?  He's got to make some...  Oh, how great it did crash into a tomato truck.  The whole town gets the cheese and tomatoes.  And then an olive oil truck hits that wreck.  Yeah, you cut up the onions from a helicopter and you have a little abogadoosh. 
[03:41:00]  Abogadoosh.  Yeah, give me a little abogadoosh.  My mother, rest in peace.  We made the best of a macasar in the neighborhood.  Everyone from the neighborhood.  Yeah, did they?  Did they?  Everyone from the neighborhood.  Really?  Did they really?  Oh, the bread was so fresh.  Was it really?  Snooze fest.  You can smell it any Sunday.  You smell it down the block.  I buy Pepperidge Farm wheat.  I eat two pieces and I throw it out. 
[03:41:30]  Fuck your mom and her bread shit face.  She should have baked a gun and shot herself with it.  Hey, Bobby, what city is wasting your day by forcing you to deliver mozzarella?  Right now, Cranberry, New Jersey, down here at Costco's warehouse.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's a lot.  You could buy, like, fucking, you know, a shitload of that.  I'm a fat ale.  Yes, nobody in that town gets yeast infection.  Hey, real quick, Opie, good luck, congratulations. 
[03:42:00]  I just signed off on 24 years of bliss last week.  But don't let that hold you back.  What I learned today from my hero, Anthony, you can't fuck.  You can't fight.  That's it.  Yeah, I like that.  That was a good what did we learn today.  That's right.  And if this is your first time at fuck club, you got to fuck.  Absolutely.  All right, Bobby.  That's right.  I'm not a lover. 
[03:42:30]  I'm a fighter.  Oh, fuck it.  I'm a lover, too.  All right, there he goes.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  There goes PBR.  Oh, he was giving us a honk.  Oh, he fucked it up.  Oh, the Gene Simmons official promo.  Wow.  Oh, look how fast.  Anthony, now you got the official challenge.  Calling out Gene Simmons promo.  Challenge.  Gene Simmons, you're a lousy fuck.  You're disrespectful.  And I fucking call you out.  Gene Simmons has to try to hit on fucking other guys' chicks. 
[03:43:00]  I'll be fucking your girlfriend.  Because that's the only in he has with girls.  He talks about his fucking prowess.  From what I saw in that videotape, he can't fuck.  Gene, I call you out.  Come on this show.  And I'll rip your fucking wig off.  Gene Simmons is a fucking cunt.  Wow.  No, the guy fucking knew.  And he was bullshitting and trying to play me like a fucking sap. 
[03:43:30]  As I sat here.  I'll be fucking your girlfriend.  I'm fucking a girl.  Not knowing what happened yet.  I'm a fucking...  Cocksucker.  Fuck you.  I think the promo's too harsh.  I'll redo it for you real quick.  All right.  Anthony Comia needs to talk to Gene Simmons.  This is Jim Norton.  Big fan, Gene.  Love the old stuff.  Oh, boy.  And Anthony wants to talk to Gene about something. 
[03:44:00]  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Gene Simmons, I fucking call you out.  Nice.  Wow.  Solid.  That's some power.  It's official.  Not enough to me.  It's official.  We got the official promo.  Nice.  Game on, Ant.  Game on.  Fighting after school.  Fuck that guy.  Jeff in Arizona.  What's up?  We learned today that Angus Young still likes to stay in CZ Motel. 
[03:44:30]  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Let's see how honorable the crew is.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Let's say hi to Brian in Michigan.  Brian, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, I learned Frankenstein was a tall Jew.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Gene Simmons sucks.  How great is it that some guy in Michigan is entertaining Pat from a hockey? 
[03:45:00]  Well, I know.  Wah, wah, wah.  Don the trucker.  Don.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Today I learned.  Gentlemen, you must be calling the wrong show, pal.  Hey, what are you hauling there, Don?  What do you got?  What?  Tap on.  No, you're making that up to be cool.  No, I swear to God.  Playtex tap on.  A whole truck of tampons?  It's a lot of fucking tap on. 
[03:45:30]  Can't even say.  I hope he crashes into a pussy truck.  Okay, today I learned that Sam's president is black.  Yeah.  Although he was a McCain guy, so I'm a little confused by Sam's choice of shirts.  Yeah, he just wants to wear the shirt.  He just wants to be cool.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Penis Wrinkle.  I'm still talking about that idiot ringing the bell.  Today I learned that no matter what E-Rock does, he's still an idiot. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  He was doing the right thing, but he's still an idiot.  What can I tell you, E-Rock?  Let's go to Coke Logic, the king of the animations, right?  Oh, yeah.  Cigars.  Oh, actually, we got cigars and scotch.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Cigars.  I just learned that Opie routinely saves me from bombing.  I hang up on you a lot, sir.  I'm sorry.  Cigars, man.  Thank you, buddy.  Thanks for the well wishes.  I appreciate it.  All right, why don't we get out of here?  Yeah, listen. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, this is a funny way to end.  Yeah.  It's a cool guy way in.  It's been real.  It's been nice, but it hasn't been real nice.  Oh, stop.  Sorry, was that too harsh?  Yeah.  Oh.  Steve in New York City.  Steve, what did you learn?  I learned that the good news is that the home globe tribes, and the bad news is that they're  ends.  Well, they're...  That's how you interpret it.  Well, hey, listen.  I don't want to say the whole word, but...  We're just trying to keep it safe, Steve.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Ed in Jersey. 
[03:47:00]  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Ed.  Hello.  Hi, Ed.  Speak.  Sorry about that.  Yeah.  I learned that the Globetrotters pilot needs to be corrected.  Yes, he does.  I want you now.  All right.  All right.  They're attempting to bring a pilot.  Pilot.  Drew, get us out of here, will you? 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Hey, bye.  Have a nice weekend, everybody.  Yes, everybody.  Let's thank the fans.  Yes.  Have a nice...  Are we going to hear it next week?  Nope.  Happy Thanksgiving to you.  Happy Thanksgiving to you.  Happy Thanksgiving to every listener. 
[03:48:00]  Happy Thanksgiving to you.  Put that in heavy rotation, will you?  All right.  There you go.  Great.  Heavy rotation for that one.  Heavy rotation.  Heavy rotation.  Opie, may I plug?  What?  What the fuck, dude?  Jesus, me, me, me.  Go ahead.  What?  What, it's not good enough that you work for free?  Motherfucker.  Exactly.  What do you want to plug, Bella?  You fucking Vegas Friday night?  Fucking Bogata January 16th, 17th, Mr. Selfish Kid.  Which one?  And people are taking sides. 
[03:48:30]  They're saying Simmons is going to kill you.  How could Simmons get out of you?  They're saying that you're out of your fucking mind.  He's fucking can't do shit.  What's he going to do?  I want that one so bad.  He's so scared.  I'll fucking fuck up his new facelift.  How bad do you want to see Gene Simmons walk in that door?  How bad?  I would love it.  Gene Simmons.  And it's not, you know.  Why?  Why?  What would that do?  What pleasure would that give you if I walked in here?  What do you think you'd do?  Are you going to fight me?  It's in the realm of possibilities.  Shut up.  You know that. 
[03:49:00]  One day, we're just going to be doing our show and that door's going to open.  I hope you're ready.  I just want to admit that I am a lousy fuck.  I'm terrible.  I'm a lousy fuck.  I hawk my kiss gear to rip off my fans.  I'm not ripping them off.  I'm giving them what they want.  Shut up.  Fucking douche.  All right.  Drew, what do you need?  What's up, Drew?  The great Drew Boogie on MySpace.  The spell D-R-U-B-O-O-G-I-P. 
[03:49:30]  Gave yourself the name The Great Drew Boogie.  Why don't you have a fucking website?  You gave me that name.  Oh.  That's right.  Who's the idiot?  Who's the idiot that would call you The Great?  That was a 1955 sitcom moment.  Who's the idiot that gave you that name?  You did, sir.  Harumph.  Well, then keep up your greatness.
