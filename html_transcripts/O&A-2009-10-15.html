<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with complaints about Windows updates, quickly moving to a discussion of rapper Soldier Boy and a viral video showcasing his wealth, seemingly in response to owing his landlord $10,000.  The hosts, along with studio guest Sam, and numerous callers analyzed the video,  frequently using the n-word while debating its usage and Soldier Boy's authenticity. The conversation branched into discussions of "real gangsters" in hip-hop, various rappers' legal troubles,  the potential home invasion risk posed by Soldier Boy’s display of wealth, and a documentary about the marketing of rap music.  The show briefly shifted to sports, specifically LeBron James, before returning to rappers and their legal issues, and concluding this segment with a quick mention of an incident at a Burlington Coat Factory and Jimmy Norton discussing his upcoming stand-up shows and fear of propeller planes.

The next segment began with the hosts mentioning an upcoming Long Island home invasion story and a "coach story," both detailed later.  The death of Captain Lou Albano was announced, leading to a lengthy discussion of his career, including his work with Cyndi Lauper.  Greg Valentine, a wrestler managed by Albano, called in to pay tribute.  News reports on Albano's death were played.  The conversation then shifted to Maria Shriver using a cell phone while driving, prompting discussions about hands-free devices.  The death of Killer Kowalski was also mentioned.  A Jacktober segment featuring a song about Allentown was included, along with further discussion of Ivanka Trump’s appearance and Arnold Schwarzenegger impressions. The "coach story" detailed a woman who claimed lottery winnings and gave away merchandise at a Burlington Coat Factory, causing a riot and her arrest for fraud. Callers shared eyewitness accounts of similar incidents, leading to discussions about racial dynamics and media biases. Jimmy Norton's upcoming stand-up performances and the dangers of prop planes were again discussed before a break.

A subsequent segment focused on a harrowing prop plane experience, followed by a vulgar critique of the movie *Taken*, its plot, and the actors' performances, particularly Liam Neeson.  The discussion expanded to a racially charged debate on the careers of various actors (Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Tom Hanks, Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Will Smith, and others), Hollywood casting biases, and the perceived decline of actresses' careers with age.  M. Night Shyamalan's career and action film realism were also discussed, followed by further discussion on race relations in America and the lasting effects of slavery.

A significant portion of the show featured comedian Patrice O'Neal.  The conversation began with a heated exchange about race relations and historical injustices, transitioning into a humorous but offensive discussion of ethnic stereotypes, with frequent use of racial slurs and vulgar language. O’Neal's question, "why do y'all hate niggas?", sparked a lengthy discussion on racial dynamics.  The conversation included discussions of Long Island home invasions and Opie's personal experiences.  A "Jocktober" segment was interrupted by a lengthy, highly offensive discussion of midget pornography, with graphic descriptions and commentary. The show also covered radio team Kramer and Kelly from Allentown, their radio style, and a ranking of "ugliest" US cities, employing vulgar commentary.

The final segment heavily criticized other radio shows, particularly "Kramer and Kelly," mocking their style and perceived inauthenticity, contrasting it with the hosts' own brand of edgy humor.  The hosts used the term "Junktober" repeatedly.  The discussion included vulgar commentary on a Maury Povich show segment featuring little people and a bra donation drive.  Two Philadelphia rappers, Cool C and Steady B, and their involvement in a crime were briefly mentioned.  The segment concluded with further derisive commentary about a midget performing a magic trick on Maury, and a thank you to Patrice O’Neal.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  and we do it again yes and do it again and we just do this yesterday i think so i think we did yes  yes yes yes yes what happened but i love windows oh it's just the bestest bestest operating system  ever what's happening over there well you know right when you get going on something uh windows  decides hey we're gonna update your computer let's just try to help you out you know i had 
[00:00:30]  automatic updates on which is uh what danny brought up but probably should shut that crap off  but uh so now so update and let it fucking reboot and let's let's rock and roll no but it's a pain  ass you want to be up and running by the time the show starts right you don't have to fiddle you  don't have to fiddle you just just click a couple things yeah a couple of things let's go but then 
[00:01:00]  it says you know would you like to restart now and then there's a countdown and then you say no later  and then like two minutes later it comes would you like to restart it forces you to restart it's  impatient it just wants to restart windows sucks a dick and that's how we start today windows sucks  a dick yes yeah i want to talk about the uh the coat lady i want to talk about the uh the uh soldier  boy uh song on twitter there's a bunch of good little stories right out of the box today i just 
[00:01:30]  have no clue what's soldier boy story oh god you see if you use what they like to say the n word  the n word it's very very uh there's a lot of outrage people get fired and uh it just causes havoc  yeah wherever it is uh heard and then you got something like soldier boy that just throws it  around like it's the word the and we're supposed to understand why this n word is so powerful  yeah the n word the n word is not powerful if if soldier boy and many others are using it like they 
[00:02:00]  do yeah i mean why so stop with your dumb stories on the n word yes enough enough with the n word  when when he's throwing it around like crazy everything i watch uh uh the hip-hop community  throwing it around like crazy yeah you know what it's already it's simple in america no matter who 
[00:02:30]  you are you should be able to use every word out there whatever words there hey there's consequences  we understand that there's definitely consequences and in certain contexts the consequences are either  greater or less uh they shouldn't all be the same if you're inciting people if you're using it as a  derogatory term to somebody um there's going to be a problem right but if you're just using the word  especially in the news story uh and but they say the n word it's uh it's embarrassing yeah it's gotten to 
[00:03:00]  the point where they're scared the media to actually say the word or still be outrage and and it's  insulting when black people are are throwing the word around i know people gonna go wow you sound  like anthony today but when black people are throwing the word around like it's nothing but  then whitey does the same thing and then there's all sorts of problems outrage that doesn't make sense  yeah it doesn't make sense that one group is allowed to say a word and another group isn't  i i don't know what the hell this is all about i i saw i saw a video the other day that was very 
[00:03:30]  similar to this soul soldier boy video and it was some other homeboy with a stack of hundreds  laying it out on his pool table going i i got i got hundreds yeah well i has as i has hundreds  i don't know what i had his hundreds whatever he was saying it was beyond my comprehension it's it's a  whole nother language when we play this clip i defy you to understand what the fuck he's talking about 
[00:04:00]  i like by the way i like the rappers are saying nigger in their songs to do it it's like they're  not going to be told what to do or what to say and they shouldn't be of course absolutely but this  you know whitey running scared the media running scared the white media running scared and using  the n-word you know they're like you keep saying jimmy but you know that's what a real problem and i  don't see people coming after him and like they would if a white guy did well it's like rush limbo i just  got he got dropped that's the same thinking like where we're going to take into that next 
[00:04:30]  yeah we'll take into that incendiary sam what is this soldier boy song all about it's on twitter  it's on youtube sam is our um liaison to the black community being that he probably has some african  uh blood in him yeah let's say the hip-hop community uh what was that sam would you say  the hip-hop community oh the hip-hop community yeah um well it's not as soldier boy tmz posted a  thing that soldier boy owed his landlord ten thousand dollars and so soldier boy responded 
[00:05:00]  well pay the landlord well i pay my rent pay the landlord soldier boy responded by making a twitter  video which is now on youtube i don't know if it's still on his twitter where he shows off all his  jewelry jewelry not jewelry it's called jury jury look at my jury look at my jury what southern accent  yeah yeah yeah jewelry that's what it is uh his designer luggage whether it be designer luggage 
[00:05:30]  louis gucci oh shit yo as well as his shoe boxes but that doesn't solve the problem that he owes his  landlord ten thousand he's he's he's saying he's got the money so why doesn't he pay his landlord i think  it's he's trying to prove that he had he's not poor that he's got money no one thinks he's poor  yeah yeah yeah no one thinks he's poor yeah and he's uh showing off his shoe boxes full of  hundreds stacks stacks you know he's smarter than us why's that because all the people that put their 
[00:06:00]  money in the market instead of putting it in shoe boxes yeah well even though this comes from  even though the stock market is uh making a huge comeback certainly is but it's one of those end of  the year comebacks over ten thousand for the first time in a while yesterday haven't you checked your  uh statements i don't check my comments check them no check them it'll make you feel better  you know those uh things that come in from from uh barry i shred them well you don't even look i  don't know no should check them i look like last period they went up a little bit period and it's like 
[00:06:30]  holy shit how does this guy what's he what's he putting it in you know what then he should freaking  uh take it all out because you know end of the year stock market stuff is very scary no no barry  january one he's in for the long haul that's what i told him i go i like investing a little  conservatively for the long haul and then you just watch it kind of tick up up a little bit  and then he and then he and then he reallocates to certain other stocks that are are doing better 
[00:07:00]  like he does the research it's nice having somebody like that it's nice having a jew behind you  yes that's what i meant to say a jew who's he based out of he's very good long island yeah  long island all right let's get back to the soldier boy uh video soldier boy tell him that's his phone  name oh really tell him is his last name so this is going viral so basically it's him uh with a  video cam just showing that he has lots of money it's just a cell phone just a cell phone video  showing his jewelry and and and designer handbags and and saying something uh he is speaking i 
[00:07:30]  believe he's speaking in some language that i don't really understand i understand uh uh when  he says nigga but i don't understand any other not even one other word the concept of what he's  trying to say is is by me thank god he has some talent and he could come up with a rap song because  if he went for a job interview and talked like that i don't know if he would get the job yeah that  could be i really don't think he would get the job well you know that's why he's got to be a

[00:17:00]  who are armed what about those guys taking some of his stuff oh yeah an inside job i guess if there's  a betrayal of trust oh soldier boy's in a lot of trouble but soldier boy used to have a very  bubblegum pop type of image because he didn't yeah he came on as like a teeny bopper favorite rapper  yeah so now he's a all hardcore gang gang gang started making videos like this and people were  like all right i mean well he was always like this he's just playing himself now is he is he  which is the real answer no i bet she was posing with the with his early stuff yeah i think that's 
[00:17:30]  probably more i bet she was always like this that's probably more he's marketed to be kind of  like a safe rapper yeah kid friendly thing but he's that's my guess i don't know he's being a  little more honest i think now how old is he he's uh in his i think very early 20s but you  girls like him very much let's say hi to greg and dc greg good morning boy hey greg i just wanted  to make sure you guys knew that the whole reason soldier boy needed all those stacks of honey was  because he got arrested for running away from an abandoned home he was shooting a video in and 
[00:18:00]  didn't have permission to be there when he came back to get his car he was arrested and had to post  and this was whopping a thousand dollar bail oh that's that's it wait that's why he went to a  gym that's where his street cred comes from yo i thought it was some kind of gunning  he was living the sunlight  also his arrest was nothing well like i said white boy can have an arrest like that he's not 
[00:18:30]  gonna carry soldier boy's not gonna get brought up on turn uh-huh you've been arrested worse than  that greg i'm sorry sam shut up let the real stars of the show talk wow see sam like who you  see not me then get off the phone wow i'm sorry sam what i said what i need to say that's it  that's like let's go to hydro hydro what's up hydro what it do what do you got hydro 
[00:19:00]  soldier boy that that nigga he's such a poser man if you if you ever watch any interviews with him  he's real articulate and college boy like so this whole flash and money and diamonds and jewels and  all that that shit is nothing but a front man gang gang gang get on my fucking nerves with that shit  it's all fake one ball who's a gangster like who's a who's a rapper i was wrong then he he's always  been the bubble pop if he were in the street without his you know security he'd be in a lot 
[00:19:30]  of trouble oh yeah yeah wait would people come after him or no hell yeah yeah if he were walking  down the street by himself his chain would be stolen within seconds if you're in a rough neighborhood  because that's what they do you know if if somebody goes into a rough neighborhood thinking  they're tough you can't have that kind of jury you can't have that kind of jury on you  wait would they because of who he is they would say they would take his chain in a heartbeat  really uh-huh yeah damn yo how about yeah gang gang gang can i call sam a nigga you just did my 
[00:20:00]  friend you just did oh i don't why why you gotta do him like that why you gotta do him like that  why you gotta do him like that you just did it doesn't seem appropriate i'm asking childish white  guy questions that's all right who's a rapper who's a real gangster who's not a fucking fake or who's  not like who's a guy who's a real problem well i mean the rappers who are real real problems  fifty cent i would say has to be used to be you yeah that's the thing to be any guy used to be

[00:28:00]  i like uh i like checking those out yeah you'll check it out yeah you gotta keep tabs we're learning  about the real gangsters though we got dave in cleveland dave yeah what's up homeboys oh jeez  what's happening they're saying lebron has the flu my friend is lebron all right it's all right we  got shack diesel bringing up the uh bring up the points last night even though they lost it's all  right wait how many points did shack have i think he had 11 on it i mean shack is playing for cleveland  oh yeah big trade that was a big trade they gave him the snow shovel during the press conference 
[00:28:30]  i didn't forget it's all good we're bringing a king or a ring for the king this year man  well i think he got shack maybe a year to two years too late my friend yeah i hate to say it  i hate to say that he's still a power he's still a powerhouse in the middle that's what we need  look i know my knicks are still on the way up so i wouldn't mind seeing you know the cavaliers get a  nice championship for you guys i appreciate it then lebron will go play for you guys there's an  article in the paper today saying uh no fucking way does that happen i don't know man he's gotta 
[00:29:00]  i mean he's gotta open i mean his contract's over with after this no we all understand that but  here's my here's my uh my my two cents on this thing which is pretty stupid but i think he stays  in cleveland until he gets you guys a championship and then he feels like okay now i can move to a  big market well i mean that makes sense especially because i mean think about what jordan did you know  he made a franchise really right so maybe lebron's trying to do the same thing and then go play with  your uh your real gangsta jay-z over there you know what i'm saying well why not all right if they 
[00:29:30]  win this year then uh it's very easy for him to leave but let's say they don't they don't win at  all all right he signs another two years to you know give it a real shot for for you guys i don't know  you don't think seven years is a real shot though man i mean i think about i think about after you  know we got all the pieces now you don't think except for a real gangster delante west you hear about  there a point guard what happened he was down in like maryland he got arrested for uh rolling on a  uh motorcycle two loaded shotguns and a handgun in a guitar case that's antonio banderas that see there 
[00:30:00]  you go we're talking about gangsters you got one right there in cleveland i'm gonna call him desperado  west from now on desperado yeah you think he's gonna be in you think he's gonna be in trouble  from that incident i don't know man he's got he's been diagnosed with bipolar so he's talking  about lithium he excused himself from the team already i don't know what the hell's going on  fuck all right but uh hey what i call for uh sam yeah you remember loon from bad boy oh yeah yeah 
[00:30:30]  who's loon what's loon that's a real gangsta you thought he i thought he was all bubblegum because  he was a bad boy and you know he made all his money and shit he got fucking locked up for  stabbing a dude with a ballpoint pen like forty times in the throat see that's the thing like  that's a real gangsta who might have been like really like a big star but nobody knows who he  is anymore because he went to jail because he's a real gangster real gangsters don't and pesci did  in casino by the way he probably got the idea for a lot of gangster movies is he in jail for a long 
[00:31:00]  time oh yeah april levine files for divorce yeah that's uh oh shit yo she's divorcing derrick  from some 41 right damn she got married when she's like fucking hey dave good conversation  thank you good luck with that uh are they still wearing shack attack shirts  now cleveland is a team to watch this year we'll see what happens but uh yeah avril levine is uh  filing for divorce all right from her he's that little midget singer for some 41 right 
[00:31:30]  oh i knew it wasn't and you know what i thought that was gonna work out no way sam made a good  point the real gangsters you don't know about them because they fucked it up before they before  they hit before they hit i was watching behind the music on nwa you know like ice cube went to  like art college did he before nwa the cube before nwa yeah before nwa and then he created this whole  thing he's like oh man this is where rap is going we got to get mean wait before rap he was tracing a  fucking turkey around his hand you don't do that in art college that's how you start i think so

[01:01:00]  the wrestling scene  in the 80's  Cindy Lauper  you might remember  he did a video  with her  girls just want  to have fun  girls just want  to have fun  played her dad  yeah  which brought  the whole  music wrestling  thing together  yeah that was  kind of the first  thing because  then she got  involved  she actually  went in the  ring and  did something  I don't know  what the fuck  was going on  back then  well you know  they were  doing what  they could  so  Captain Lou Albano  was great  Captain Lou Albano 
[01:01:30]  started out as a heel  yes  turned into a nice guy  a baby face  a baby face  good Mike  he was one of  those good Mike  guys  he could get on  Mike and talk  shit  absolutely  and he knew  how to wear  I was going to  say he knew  how to wear  a rubber band  put the rubber  bands in his  beard  kind of looked  ridiculous  but he pulled  it off  what do you  think of  Ivanka  that little  Trump daughter  she's sexy  man  yeah  beautiful  alright  just getting  a quick opinion  because they  just had her  on the news  and I'm just  like  she's got  great legs 
[01:02:00]  she's great  everything  you're missing  the obvious  though  she has a  tiny mouth  and a tiny  little chin  it bothers  me  yes  it bothers  me  I have to  see a picture  of her  you get a  picture  she has a  little mouth  and a  little chin  but everything  else is like  fucking  gorgeous on her  Captain Lou  is wearing a  rubber band  that looks like  a booger  coming out  of his nose  looked like  snot  like they  weren't always  tied up  very tight  no  he met a  man that  is somebody  special  a man that  stands up  6 foot 1  and weighs  28 pounds 
[01:02:30]  he has  perfected  the figure  4 leg  lock  this man  is unbelievable  he is often  imitated  but never  duplicated  look into his  eyes  look at the  facial expression  look at the  high cheekbones  look at the  long flowing  blonde hair  look at that  56 inch chest  look at that  33 inch waist  look at them  23 inch biceps  look at that  24 inch neck  the man has  got it all  together  as I said  he is one of a  kind  he is a man  that can walk  tall  walk down  without anyone  matching him  anyone coming  in his class  he is one of a  kind  Greg Valentine  and I am  his manager  I am proud  to be  you know I am  going to pay you  a compliment  also  Captain  Lou Albano  you are one  of a kind  well maybe so 
[01:03:00]  but I am glad  to be  alright  Greg Valentine  he had his  wrap  Captain  Lou Albano  said it all  you know  every opponent  that I have  whether it be  the world champion  Hulk Hogan  the intercontinental  champion  Tito Santana  every one of  every time  they hear the  name Greg  the Hammer  Valentine  it sends fear  right down  their spine  because they  know I possess  like Captain  Lou Albano  said I possess  the greatest  hold in  professional wrestling  today  is Captain 
[01:03:30]  Lou big enough  to do a  I remember  you montage  today  no  I don't think  there's enough  clips  you don't think  so  there probably  is  but who cares  who cares  who really  cares  let's find out  a little more  on Captain  Lou  Captain  Lou  we got some  audio here  quick  quick little  thing  and then we  get into  the coach  story  right  yes  one of the  most over  the top  managers  in the world  of pro  wrestling  has died  Captain  Lou Albano  was one of  the most  recognized  promoters  in the  business  and his  celebrity  went beyond  the wrestling 
[01:04:00]  ring by  landing  acting roles  and appearing  in a memorable  Cyndi Lauper  music video  so well known  for having  those rubber  bands  in his beard  too  Albano  died of  natural causes  at his home  in Carmel  New York  memorial services  are tomorrow  he was 76  years old  76  there you go  he also was  what Mario  for a couple  years  yeah they did  this show  back in  89  90  90  91  somewhere around  late 80s  and he kind  of he was  like the  the host  I guess  it was animated 
[01:04:30]  it was an  animated series  but then he  would host it  and he was  he was Mario  so he played  live action  Mario  for  never saw  it  I didn't  even know  until I read  his obituary  this morning  all right  hey  before we get  to the  coach story  Anthony  because this  is just  unbelievable  Craig Treadway  he's one of  the local  newsreaders  oh yes  you might have  met Craig Treadway  you might have  drank with Craig  Treadway  I know Craig Treadway  yeah he works  for the station  that your ex  works for  yes yes  and this 
[01:05:00]  Maria Shriver  story has just  got legs  yeah  as they say  in the biz  she's on her  cell phone  and Arnold  made a huge  law  you shouldn't  be doing  that  and there's  his own  life on the  cell phone  yeah  of course  and she should  be  because we all  break that  law when we  can  not me  not you  Jimmy  nope  not a once  nope  I'm the  hands-free kid  Jimmy Lies  were you voted  the hands-free kid  I was voted  boy least likely  to talk on a  cell phone  while driving  ain't got it  thank you  Anthony  the hands-free 
[01:05:30]  kid  I was going  for a BJ  joke  right  oh  what do you  got on  Captain Lou  there Sambo  that's your  new rap name  by the way  Sambo  I don't think  I'm thinking  of Fly  I think  there are  problems  with it  really  but  Captain Lou  is the  manager  of  champions  he managed  15  tag team  champions  yeah because  they gave him  the best  wrestlers 
[01:06:00]  because he  was so  animated  no he  brought  the wrestlers  to the  championships  no no  the manager  doesn't do  shit  doesn't do  anything  incorrect  no except  maybe throw  like salt  in people's  eyes  so you're  telling me  grab a chair  and hit the  person while  the ref isn't  looking  the Heenan  family would  have been  just as  successful  without Bobby  Heenan  yeah  I seriously  doubt that  the British  Bulldogs  the wild  Samoans  all these  people  didn't need  Captain Lou  dead people  you mean  was he the  manager for  Nikolai  Volkov 
[01:06:30]  yeah  yeah  I think  at one  point  he was  yeah  all right  and we  got some  breaking news  on Captain  Lou Albano  Anthony  you're not  going to  believe this  one  this is  unbelievable  it finally  happened  Ryan in  Indiana  listen to  this  Ryan  good evening  hey Ryan  yes Captain  Lou the first  pro wrestler ever  could die of  natural causes  holy shit  it finally  happened Sam  killer  Kowalski died  recently of  natural causes  are you sure  yes I am  so he's the  second one  he's not the  second one 
[01:07:00]  many wrestlers  are dead  and you can  only say that  two died of  natural causes  classy Freddie  Blassie died of  natural causes  did he later  change his name  to a raper  Kowalski  no  it was always  killer  oh okay  sorry  I got the  crimes mixed up  yes it was  just killer  Kowalski  he's hardcore  gang gang gang  I've heard  all right  are we going to  spend that much  time on fucking  Lou Albano  if it were my  show we would  oh I bet  you could do  that on Saturday  it's not  maybe we will  you'll do a  whole out of it  on that I'm 
[01:07:30]  sure  I think we  should do a  show in  memoriam of  Captain Lou  really  yeah  there's not  that much  to do with  him  he was around  for so many  years  yes so  cares  just when we  thought he  was a rock  do a show  on a rock  no the rock's  not interesting  just when we  thought the  rock a rock  all right Sam  do it  do it live  the I  remember you  Captain Lou Albano  tell us a little  about him  your memories  go ahead  well he  touched  multiple  generations of  fans  not children  generations of 
[01:08:00]  fans  I mean  he's the type  of guy that  just when you  thought he was  done he would  come back  he became  famous early on  zombie  not a zombie  no he won't  be back  he was a kid  toucher and a  zombie  no  neither  just when you  thought he was  done he came  back like  zombies  neither of  those things  he managed  the wild  Samoans to  tag team  championship  glory and  you'd think  nobody could  step into the  next generation  but he did  and he took  the head  shrinkers  also a great  Samoan tag team  head shrinkers 
[01:08:30]  yes Samu and  Fatu  yeah  Sione later  to tag team  championship glory  right  what else  I mean  he had the  British Bulldogs  a very famous  tag team  he took them  Anthony  so Craig Treadway  was on  what  the mic cut off  I think there's  something wrong  with the wiring  we'll have Mars  look into that  and then you can  continue with your  remembrance of  Captain Lou Albano  the mic pulled a  Captain Lou Albano  and died  pulled a Chris Benoit  and choked itself  oh shit  ooh

[01:18:00]  and you're  making  little  tanks  and it  was  no it  wasn't  it was  a square  tank  of  water  would  go in  there  oh  it was  for the  semiconductor  industry  like when  they made  semiconductors  poisonous gas  is released  so we made  the gas  scrubbers  which put  the gas  in there  and then  water  would  get in  there  and kind  of fucking  clean  the air  right  and I  had to  sit there  and make  these square  boxes  oh I thought  you were  making toys  no no 
[01:18:30]  fucking  little toy  tank  no square  boxes of  PVC  and weld  it with  PVC rod  and a  torch  don't get  it too  close  or you'll  burn it  too far  away  and the  bead  won't  sit  in there  nicely  so fucking  call  Oprah  man  this is  perfect  for her  and I  slept  in my  car  because I  couldn't  make the  payments  on my  car  so I  quit my  job  so they  couldn't  find me  and take  my car  which was  your home  which was  my home  and the  only way  I could  get another  job  was with  the car  so I  figured I'd  quit the  job  and get  another  job 
[01:19:00]  but I  had to  talk to  the repo  guy  out of  taking the  car  that day  you  already  had a  job  you should  have hid  the car  I didn't  make enough  money  to hide  the car  to keep  your job  I did  after  no no  because the  repo guy  was coming  back to  the job  the next  day  he was  a giant  black guy  no no  because he  knew where  I worked  and if he  showed up  the next  day he'd  be like  give me  the money  and what  do I  say  you put  the car  in the woods  and you  walk a couple  blocks to  the job  and then  what do I  tell him  when he  gets there  I don't  know where  the car  is 
[01:19:30]  you can't  do that  holy  shit  what do  you have  to lose  though  I can't  do that  he'll  beat me  up  he was  giant  he was  intimidating  that's when  they were  allowed to  beat you  up  I was a  little  you'd  fucking  break my  legs  the repo  GMAC  all right  I should  have went  to first  federal  and talked  to bill  deal  we're not  a bank  jerry  old bill  deal  you know  old bill  deal is as  big a prick 
[01:20:00]  as fucking  the rest  of them  I love  bill deal  down at  first  federal  well  what you're  saying is  what are  you saying  too good  fucking  great movie  we might have  to go  backwards  again  because  someone is  pointing out  in the news  clip  the guy  says  talking  while  driving  on a  cell  phone  I know  we all  mess up  but that  could be  fun to  talking  while  driving  on a  cell  before  he did  his  Arnold  impression 
[01:20:30]  we showed  you this  photo  yesterday  of  Shriver  talking  while  driving  on a  cell  phone  talking  while  driving  on a  cell  phone  alright  can that  work in  any way  I'm  sort of  thinking  talking  while  driving  on a  cell  phone  it's  not  completely  proper  but  it should  be  driving  while  talking  on a  cell  phone  while  driving  but 
[01:21:00]  it  works  this  way  his  inflection  was wrong  it was  talking  while  driving  on a  cell  phone  it's  almost  like  there  should  be  a  comma  talking  while  driving  on a  cell  phone  while  driving  was  thrown  in there  so it  should  be  commas  he  should  have  said  talking  on a  cell  phone  while  driving  or  he  should  have  said  driving  your  cell  phone  while  talking  through  the  combustion  part  of the  engine  the  amateur  sprocket  has 
[01:21:30]  caused  an  interference  you know  Graham in  Pennsylvania  has a  very good  point  that needs  to be  addressed  go ahead  Graham  yes  hey  Anthony  I was  calling  to ask  if you were  living in  your car  how come  you couldn't  pay for  your car  so it  didn't get  taken  what other  bills did  you have  yeah  that's a  very good  point  it's not  like you were  driving around  in a really  nice car  I would  assume  that is  a good  good  point  Anthony  was what  they called  n-word  rich  see I  wasn't  making a  lot of  money  at all 
[01:22:00]  I wasn't  making enough  money  and it  was the  year I  finally got  booted out  of the  house  that mom  finally  decided  you know  Anthony  you gotta  fucking  go  so  instead of  saying n-word  rich  can we  say you  were  cave beast  rich  yes  we can  say that  I  I  went  I had  to leave  so I  had to  get a  place  to live  so I  had to  pay  like rent  and buy  food  and all  that shit  and pay  the car  payment  which was  easy to 
[01:22:30]  do when I  was living  at home  because  you know  that's all  I had to  pay pretty  much  now I  had a  bunch  of  fucking  bills  but you  were  living  in your  car  so you  didn't  have  to  pay  rent  no  that  was  after  I  couldn't  pay  the  rent  anymore  because  I  was  paying  the  car  payment  oh  boy  and  oh  boy  yeah  well  I  just  wasn't  making  enough  nav tech  industries  did not  pay me  enough  money  but they  gave me  enough  money  for  no 
[01:23:00]  not  really  no  no  not  really  but  what  did  I  I  think  I  bought  a  slot  car  set  that's  nice  yeah  I  didn't  I  don't  know  what  I  was  doing  with  my  money  let  me  think  um  just  being  irresponsible  like  most  people  in their  twenties  it  wasn't  enough  money  where  I  could  do  anything  with  it  you  juggle  all  your  bills  so  you  could  buy  shit  so  I  was  all  fucked  up  and  then  they  finally  did  find  my  car 
[01:23:30]  and  took  it  then  I  had  no  place  to  live  and  no  car  and  no  job  and  no  job  so  where  did  you  go  first  I  in  Hicksville  with  Nick  Nick  came  from  Soviet  Union  and  Nick  you  work  it  you  work  I  work  it  my  whole  life  I  work  now  you  work 
[01:24:00]  and  you  had  to  he  picked  me  up  in  the  morning  from  my  friend's  house  and  drove  me  there  and  I  got  a  15  minute  break  to  eat  crackers  and  drink  coffee  I  swear  to  you  you  worked  in  a  sweat  and  then  it  was  back  to  the  bridge  port  milling  machine  to  just  mill  out  with  that  white  jism  lubricant  and  just  metal  chips  flying  everywhere  and  god  forbid 
[01:24:30]  I  fucked  something  up  by  one  thousandth  of  an  inch  Nick  what  do  you  don't  work  it  right  you  don't  pay  attention  and  don't  work  not  like  me  and  then  during  the  15  minute  break  him  and  Ingrid  Zigrid  Zigrid  was the  woman  that was  working  there  too  what  did  she  do  anything  Nick  fucking  told her  to do  get  more  coffee  and  crackers  Zigrid  like  an assistant  or something  Zigrid  you get 
[01:25:00]  this  Zigrid  get me  paper for  job  need  be  done  give  to  stupid  over  here  give  it  to  stupid  he  called  me  stupid  why  because  I  was  stupid  you  weren't  though  no  I  was  pretty  stupid  did  you  want  to  punch  Nick  in the  face  I  hated  Nick  and  then  he  one  day  he  sat  down  and  I  think  it was  20  minute  break  because  he  was  going  into  his  when  he  was  World War  II  prisoner  of war  in a  Nazi  camp  as a  Russian  and the  shit  he had  to go  through  wow  was he  beaten 
[01:25:30]  senseless  wow  it was  great  now  all it  was  if I  don't  work  it  all I  think  about  is  Nazi  beatings  that's  why  most  people  work  hard  work  it  work  it  please  work  it  as soon as  you're  alone  with your  thoughts  it's not  a good  thing  Nikolai  I  work it  with  Nikolai  from  Soviet  Union  whatever  happened  to  Nikolai  I  don't  know  hopefully  a  Nazi  came by  and finally  got him  he was  trying to be  nice to you  in his own way  Nick gave me 
[01:26:00]  enough to get me  on my feet  which was good  gave me enough  so I was able  to get a piece  of shit  truck  I moved in  with a  friend  a whole  family  that I knew  and wound up  doing like  housekeeping  duties  and working  what  I never  remember this  one  oh yeah  you were like  a foster child  in your 20s  I was  moved in  you were the  oldest foster  child in  America  I was  I moved in  with the  Simolesky family  why would they  take you in  I don't know  because they were  nice  did you have  like a friend 
[01:26:30]  in that family  yeah  Dave  Sean  I went to  school with  Dave  we took in  the likes of you  over the years  you know  I was one of those  guys  and then I would  like do the  dishes and vacuum  and shit like that  you become a slave  for the family  that's the problem  in those situations  because we brought  in my sister's  best friend  at 17  and she basically  became a slave  for our family  yeah that's pretty  much what it was  yeah she had  to babysit  clean  fucking laundry  and work jobs  no pay  right  but you could  stay there  if you take  care of all the  shit  if you worked 
[01:27:00]  harder than  their actual  kids  yeah yeah  that was pretty  much you know  that was  it was fun  it uh  you know  kept me busy  and I wasn't  hard to work it  and I need to know  how did you blow  that situation  I didn't blow  that situation  come on  there's a story  that one  that one  I actually  when did the family  say get the fuck  out  no they didn't  the whole family  died  moved  no  moved  they sold the  house and moved  and then me  and Sean  Simileski 
[01:27:30]  who worked with  Joe Curry  at the fence  factory  uh  uh  finally moved  into the apartment  that became  Pee Wee's Playhouse  but they didn't  really move  you brought into that  no no they did  that was a big scam  to get you the fuck  out of their house  they moved up  to Binghamton  did you ever  check the house  a couple weeks  later  no I  I bet you  they moved  right back  no no  because Sean  Sean left also  yeah  Sean left also  and then me  and Sean  were roommates  and then  my chick  moved in  Carrie  she moved in 
[01:28:00]  and um  we all just  struggled to pay  rent while  um  of trying to  avoid uh  cocaine  and the landlord  oh so you had  money in shoeboxes  like Soja Boy  no no  there weren't  there weren't  even shoes  in shoeboxes  you probably had  pennies in  fucking shoeboxes  there was nothing  going on there  except a few  a lot of beer  drinking  a lot of games  playing  uh  that was where  everyone came over  Laird  fucking  uh  Adam Ferrara

[01:29:30]  and they  had to get  a new  pool  they had to  fill it up  again  every time  they used  it they had  to fill it  up  that was  the job  I was on  where one  one time  I had to  go into  the house  because the  daughter was  so hot  and rummaged  through her  panty drawer  how old  was she  pair of  fucking  snuggies  I will bet  she was 15  nah  she was  probably in  her late  teens  late teens  yeah  and I had  to  like I  saw her  and a  friend  and they 
[01:30:00]  were asking  about the  pool  and everything  and you  know  when is it  going to be  done  and  stop  choking me  they were  asking  all kinds  of fun  questions  and I  had to  go in  the house  for a  drink  of water  and then  I just  had to  go into  a room  no I  didn't steal  any  I just  had to  like  open  the drawer  up  and  rummage  through  them  remember  how hot  that was  rummaging  remember  how hot  that was  though  I mean  dude I had  such a boner  fucking  you're a  teenage boy  you're not

[01:32:00]  somehow  the panties  were like  they're like  oh you know  these went  on her  and then you  just kind of  look at the  panties and  picture them  in the panties  dude they felt  so good  wrapped around  my penis  were they silky  or cottony  no silky  silky  and I would  just stroke  did you put  them on  rub your  wee wee  didn't do  much for me  it was more  just wrapping  them around  my dick  yes I forgot  about that  like that  would really  turn me on  probably crack  like the  fucking  like that  chrome  terminator  when they 
[01:32:30]  froze them  yeah  you drop  those panties  and they just  shatter like  it dips them  in liquid  nitrogen  well we gotta  move on  we got  jocktober  we got  the long  island  home invasion  and we got  the coach  story  want to do  the coach  story  is Patrice  here now  or is he  coming later  I'm  seeing that  I'm  watching  hope he's  in the  tunnel  broken down  I'm watching  I hope  right now  he's standing  in the  left lane  of the  Lincoln  tunnel  being  fucking  honked  at  angry  giant  gas  guys  like  truck  and what's 
[01:33:00]  the coach  story all  about  you brought  this to  everyone's  attention  I love  this  some lady  where was  this  Burlington  coach  this was  in  you read  the story  this was  in Cleveland  I love  this lady  yeah  another Cleveland  story  in Cleveland  okay  and apparently  some woman  pulls up  in a  stretch  escalade  like type  limousine  really nice  gets out  and walks  into this  Burlington  coat factory  right  was she with  anyone  um  yeah  with the  limo driver  limo driver  who was the 
[01:33:30]  limo driver  I don't know  did she hire  the guy  or was he in  on this  I don't know  they didn't get  to that  point that  deep in the  story  we'll have  to I'll have  to get more  details  okay  but uh  she apparently  went into the  Burlington  coat factory  announced to  the customers  that she had  won the  lottery  right  and uh  that um  if you want  to buy  something  it's on  her  right  uh  and the  people  I heard  this now  on the  news  on 1010  wins  driving in  so it was  audio  not a  video report  so I heard  uh 
[01:34:00]  when she  made that  announcement  everybody  started getting  on their  phones and  saying you  gotta get  down here  there's  someone that  won the  lottery  giving away  free  merchandise  and at  that point  how did the  news get  involved  I don't  know  they  they  they  they  they  had to  be alerted  by somebody  yeah this  didn't  this didn't  happen  within seconds  because they  got they  got video  of her  outside the  store  so this  had to be  planned ahead  of time  which is  very suspicious  and said  it seemed  like it was  a radio  prank  they were  there long  enough where  somebody called  the news  right 
[01:34:30]  and the news  like got down  there and  immediately  catch the  tail end  of this  thing  right  but I  knew it  was in  a um  let's  just say  urban  uh  setting  by just  by the  fact that  people  were on  the phone  calling  and then  there was  a riot  afterwards  that let  me know  that  wow  there's a  problem  because the  woman  apparently  didn't win  the lottery  and wasn't  paying for  anybody's  stuff  it was a  hoax  she was just  saying that  because she  had a  white  boyfriend  so uh 
[01:35:00]  but but  they're saying  maybe something  was a little  off with her  because she  did chalk  up like  five thousand  dollars  she maxed  out her  credit card  right  buying people  stuff  and then  she just  left  yes  and there  was five  hundred  people  at the  store  at that  point  they were  able to  get five  hundred  people  down there  like that  freaking out  word of mouth  uh yeah  word of cell  phone  word of  yeah  and then she  slides out  does she tell  people that  she's going to  be back to  pay for  everyone's  coach  yeah I  think she  said she  was coming  back  she never  came back  the police  arrested her 
[01:35:30]  and charged  her with a  fraud  she said she  won one  point five  billion dollars  now there was  five hundred  people there  and there was  a thousand  waiting outside  yeah if she  was going to  spend five hundred  on each one  that would have  been her  winnings  her winnings  she said she  didn't want her  winnings  oh she said  she did not  want her winnings  she was giving  it away  wait there was  a thousand  people outside  I think so  yeah  yeah there were  a lot of  people  they were  calling going  yo you  got to get  down here  motherfucker  but what's  fucked up about  the whole thing  is she got  nothing out of  this like  they're starting  to say she's  fucking crazy 
[01:36:00]  she might be a  little cuckoo  like she didn't  she didn't walk  away with any  merchandise or  nothing  she set up  this whole  frenzy  and then she  leaves  and she gets  nothing  she's a nut  obviously  oh here's  is this the  story  can we  can we rewind  I don't even  need the  clothes  well tonight  a local store  is shut down  and in shambles  after what seemed  like a random  actual kindness  turned into chaos  it started when  a woman told  shoppers that  she won the  lottery  and she wanted  to share the  wealth  our Tanisha  Millette was  there as it  all unfolded 
[01:36:30]  and she joined  us  well Andrea  it sounded  like a great  gift  in fact the  people in the  store  some of them  told me that  this was a  blessing  but in the  end there were  hundreds of  people who were  left disappointed  and now this  store is looking  at thousands  of dollars  in damage  it was an  offer Carol  Hubbard  couldn't believe  I said are you  sure because I  can't pay you  for this  she said  honey I got  1.5 million  dollars and  I've been used  all my life  mostly by my  family members  and this is 
[01:37:00]  just my turn  to give back  and it was  an offer  extended to  every shopper  at this  East Main  Street  Burlington  Coat Factory  and not just  for clothes  I said really  I don't even  need the clothes  I said I  just need some  assistance with  my rent  she said well  how much is it  and she just  promptly wrote  out a check  these gifts  these gifts were  courtesy of this  apparent benefactor  who 10TV will  not identify  why  I won the  lottery  for half a  million dollars  thank god  I don't want  none of it  really 
[01:37:30]  that's why  I'm here  and she  wanted everyone  else to be  here too  tell your  friends  it ends  at close  today  and people  started calling  family and  friends and  pretty soon  Burlington was  packed  store managers  say she paid  for roughly  five thousand  dollars of  merchandise  with a debit  card before  she hit a  limit  10TV was  there when  she announced  that she was  going back  to the bank  to get some  cash  but by three  o'clock  police announced  there would  be no  shopping  and had to 
[01:38:00]  turn the  crowds away  well tonight  that store  is closed  while the  staff workers  try to repair  some of the  damage  many of the  shoppers  inside had  their grocery  carts  or rather  their shopping  carts filled  with merchandise  and when they  realized that  none of it  was going to  be paid  for  police say  that some  of those  shoppers  just trashed  all the  items that  they had  it is still  unclear whether  or not this  woman actually  won any  lottery money  we have been  told that she  is now in  police custody  why the fuck 
[01:38:30]  would they  identify her  maybe because  of mental  problems  so what  I know  I think  they should  it's the news  they identify  Hinkley  Hinkley had  mental problems  oh yeah  I don't know  well you know  unbelievable  though  you know  you just  can't  I gotta say  Patrice O'Neill  joining us  just in the nick  of time  because I just  gotta say  what the fuck  is it with black  people and rioting  they just  can't  what is that  about  because it's a  story  do you think  if it was a bunch  of white people 
[01:39:00]  in there  they would have  rioted  I swear to god  wait what  what about  the white  brides  that was  stopping  each other  for the  they trample  each other  to death  trying to get  a dumb wedding  all those  things  all those  white people  that do  that  well they're  fucking  different white  people that do  things  well there's  different niggas  that's crazy  bitches  and this was  like  and I think  if everybody  in this story  was white  pretty much  the same thing  happens  nope  I don't see a riot  a white woman  goes hey man  I won the lottery  and I want to  give everybody 
[01:39:30]  a free fucking  coat  call your friends  and family  they're going  to be going  to the store  and they load  up the cards  how about the  people we call  Christmas crackers  that's out there  four in the morning  punching each other  for the rock'em  sock'em robots  yeah someone died  at the  they're not  trashing the place  they are trashing  the fucking place  they're  by the way  there was  the riot  was there  was there any  violence  or are the news  just calling it a riot  because it didn't  seem like there was  any fighting  it just seemed like  fucking people  wanted to  they wrecked  they wrecked  the merchandise  yeah this is  crazy crackers 
[01:40:00]  they run through  the store  and they fuck  each other up  well that's  to get the gowns  but Patrice  makes a good  point about  the Christmas thing  there was a story  along the way  one of the workers  died  and he was trampled  to death  because everyone  was trying  to get in  for the sale  no I don't  think that was it  yes it was  can I make one  racial point  that's not very  good by the way  I want to say  out of anything  if I had to  pick one thing  that bothers me  racially about  these conversations  yeah  why 
[01:40:30]  how do white  people get away  with not being  associated with  other white people  doing dumb shit  and black people  have to be associated  with a couple of  crazy motherfuckers  at a Berlin  12th  but we do  no you do  fucking not  I don't ever  look at you  like the profile  that you are  either  a pedophile  or either  a mass  office killing  killer  or  either  a serial killer  your profile

[01:46:30]  a snack  if I'm sitting there  long enough  I gotta keep  my blood sugar  at a certain level  it's only the humiliation  of everybody honking  at what you  and you're like  I can't  I can't do anything  I hope you have  a safe trip  I can't  I don't  there's places  I just won't go  because it just  you don't go  on the prop planes  if it's enough money  I'll fly a big plane  and then I'll take  a cab  I've done it before  I flew to Atlanta  and took a cab  to South Carolina  it's only  wow  how much does that cost  it was 
[01:47:00]  I think 200  not many of those  prop planes  fly on a daily basis  four  yeah four  it's only  it's only one way  I'm going down  on a prop  and it's like  props are only  a little bit dangerous  when you're going  into the fucking snow  there are a lot  a bit dangerous  everybody  there's only two ways  you died  before 1980  a heroin overdose  or a prop plane  and you died  with a bunch  of other motherfuckers  Chantilly Lace  that motherfucker 
[01:47:30]  could have been  making hits for years  hello baby  and the stories  are always  at the end  Otis Redding  said he shouldn't  have got on  and they just  pulling big  Otis Redding  out the wall  that picture  makes me  sad  every time  they see  pulling big  Otis Redding  out the water  I've never seen that  oh it's the  fucking  worst  oh yeah  I've seen that  well  it's very sad  Otis Redding  had a career  ahead of him  he was 28 years old  he had some 
[01:48:00]  private planes  a lot of these  a lot of these  are private planes  not maintained properly  there are not  many that go down  these are chartered planes  like Aaliyah's plane  a lot of these  are not planes  like fucking  too much baggage  and anything  one of the biggest  things is if it  don't have a first  class it ain't a  real plane  I kind of say  that too  secondly  if it's two  seats on one  side and one  row on the  other side  not big  it's not  going to fucking  happen  those fly the  same speed  as 757 
[01:48:30]  500 miles an hour  a Ford Focus  drives the same  speed as a  Lamborghini  they're different  cars  who cares  I don't like  when the Ford Focus  don't just fucking  tumble apart  when they're driving  they're safe  I don't like  when the pilot  has to balance out  the plane  before he takes off  I've been on a few  of those planes  sit over here  we need you over there  you gotta go over here  and he's just eyeing it  and sort of figuring it out  you gotta check that  baggage  because it's too heavy  and where are these  fuckers coming from  there's not enough 
[01:49:00]  old white guys  to be running  these fucking  who's flying  is there even  any six degrees  of separation  from a motherfucker  who knows a pilot  these are  no  these are guys  that went to school  like they got  their private pilot's  license a lot of times  I don't know  how many military guys  are actually doing that  I don't see that many  more old white guys  man  and that's who I feel  comfortable with  old white guy  nice haircut  Sully  Sully's  you need Sully  who can drive the plane 
[01:49:30]  yeah he don't care  with the open hand  sitting back  turning the wheel  parallel parker  playing  without even looking  he's bored  he's so good  dude I can't  that's why I can't  make it to  I'll drive to Virginia  I'm driving to Washington  to the improv  so I would drive to Virginia  I would just drive  you should take the Amtrak  to Washington  that's a nice  it'd be fine  a great way to go  I like to be in control  of my destiny  it's gonna be a bumpy  shitty flight 
[01:50:00]  but it's only one way  it's an hour flight  I do it twice a year  worst flight I ever had  was on a prop plane  and that was flying  from Denver  prayer bed  dude  it was  I was fucking  in the mountains  alright  I was tic-tacking  Xanax  like fucking  tic-tacs  whoop  whoop  whoop  like a fucking  madman  it was  supposed to be  an hour  it was from Denver  to Grand Junction 
[01:50:30]  and over the  mountains  we hit fucking  headwinds  and shit  where the plane  was barely moving  and it took  like two hours  to get there  and it was going  sideways at some point  the plane would like  I'd look out the window  and the plane  was flying sideways  because the headwind  the plane had to stay  into the headwind  so it was crabbing  so it was fishtailing  like yeah  fishtailing everywhere  and rocking  back and forth  all three axes  were just moving 
[01:51:00]  at once  were you nervous  I was shitting  my fucking pants  after that flight  I never again  took that flight  I said  if we're going out  to visit  this was when I was  with Melinda  her family was out there  if we ever go  to Grand Junction again  we are flying  a big plane  to Salt Lake City  and then from Salt Lake City  to Grand Junction  that way  we don't have to go  from Denver  over the mountains  and get to Grand Junction  and never again  took a prop plane  from Denver  to Grand Junction  dude I swear to god  thought that fucking 
[01:51:30]  plane is busting apart  I just thought the wind  and turbulence and shit  was going to rip  the fucking thing  and here you are  would you do a John Madden  would you do a John Madden  or a Whoopi Goldberg  do a little bus  whoopi doesn't fly  whoopi hates flying too  I like flying  I don't mind flying at all  she takes a bus  across country  which is so much  more dangerous obviously  but psychologically  five hours  you could be there  you idiot  you could feel better  psychologically though  that was different  but you know what  ground karma  just doesn't bother  like I'm not afraid  of getting in a car 
[01:52:00]  going ah  this is going to be fantastic  and not  the idea of thinking  that I'm going to have  an accident  or a drunk drive  or fucking somebody  my big thing  is worrying about a kid  jumping in front  of my fucking truck  or something  but other than that  the idea of crashing  it's just the length of time  I don't want to know  you just don't want to know  I just you know  you don't want to know  it does take a while  to crash in a plane  if you're  if something fucks up  up there  you're dying too long  you're fucking a car  it's just 
[01:52:30]  I don't want to plummet  it's pretty much instant  I never want to plummet  you could scream  until your breath runs out  and then start screaming again  you never want to be able  to reload on a scream  then you gotta fucking  look at somebody  that you don't want to  talk to the whole flight  but now  you're holding hands  with some fucking strange  we're all going together  here it is  alright why don't we  take a break  with that thought  that's a terrific thought  to go to break with  no Jimmy  that's not you though  you're going to be  funny as hell down there 
[01:53:00]  plus you don't have  no bones to break anyway  you would just  bounce off everything  you bounce right out of there  you bounce right back to  right back to Jersey  Jimmy's like a Super Bowl  what's the motherfucker  the Herculoids  Charm Strong  what's the motherfucker  from the Herculoids  I don't know who he is  but I don't think  it's going to be  a complimentary comparison  I want to Google image that  yeah the Herculoids  gloop and gleep  that's not nice 
[01:53:30]  that's so fun  Jimmy will be fine  don't find Jimmy  in the black box  I'll tell you what happened  you'll be fine  alright quick break  we get into the Long Island  home invasion story  and maybe a little  Jocktober today  you gotta do Jocktober  alright we'll do Jocktober next  then Opie and Anthony  alright we got some shit 
[01:54:00]  to talk about  Patrice was listening  to the show earlier  but before we get into  that point you just made  just before we turn the mics on  we gotta talk about  Taken  a movie we discuss  all the time  and have you seen Taken  oh hell yeah  did you like it or not  yeah I liked it  I definitely liked it as well  Jimmy hated it  hated it  I thought the storyline  had some issues  but the action was amazing  there was no storyline  it was his fucking  dumb daughter  goes overseas  after she runs  like a retard 
[01:54:30]  a pony  a fucking retard run  watch her run  it'll ruin the movie for you  this is her run  watch  Jimmy does it perfect  watch  a pony  a retard run  the fucking hacky writing  the father  he brings her a fucking  what a Susie oven bake  whatever the fuck  it was a Mr. Microphone  or something  it sounds like  it sounds like  the beginning  of trying to get him  to like his daughter  yeah  it's obligatory  no he wants his daughter  to like him 
[01:55:00]  but the new father  you know  has all the money  he can buy the pony  and he doesn't have those  nothing  it was hack 101  and then the CIA buddy  sitting around  oh what are you doing  trying to get back  into the organization  it was fucking  watch her run  watch fucking  look  look at this hacky scene  look at this  Liam Neeson  and his awful fucking hair dye  why it looks natural to me  watch the run  wait  what a fucking idiot she is  and she's too old to do that 
[01:55:30]  with her arms flailing  she's 37  and she's running for a pony  well her best friend  is supposed to be what  17 in the movie  and her best friend  looks like she's 30  or something  this is just clips  of her running  in this movie  this helps with the movie  though  because  she's semi retarded  he has this semi retarded  daughter  and this new rich guy  who's just buying stuff  but this guy  Liam Neeson  is tremendous  but on YouTube  someone put all the  running clothes  yeah  this is great  dude's chill  theater  wait isn't that our thing 
[01:56:00]  yes  it's a fan of the show  obviously  oh one of the fans  came up with this  that's fantastic  and Liam Neeson's  fucking hair  is soy sauce  colored hair  that was that  fucking terrible  it's taking a running  retard  but they spell  retard  r-e-t-a-r-t  right  retard  the story was so  fucking weird  check it out on YouTube  this guy did a great job  one of our fans  the story was so weak  she goes over there  and she calls him  while she's under a bed  and 20 minutes later  he's on the first flight out  I've used my iPhone app 
[01:56:30]  to catch these bad men  let me walk through the house  oh I hope my hair died  doesn't leak onto my white shirt  hey in the airport  randomly  you're the guy  let me chase you  and then hop a cab  to go to the exact address  oh wait a minute  there's a hair fiber  oh wait it's mine  this is a soy noodle  do you watch  do you watch genres  like this  and enjoy it  yes  every fucking movie  like this  you can  has the cliche part  has some issues  if you think about  you can't watch 
[01:57:00]  any zombie movie ever  if you look at it  too closely  because the thing  about a zombie movie  is how the fuck  do they know  the other ones  are zombies  if you go  if you just  look at that  and say that  that'll fuck the movie up  wait how do the zombies know  like the zombies  everybody's walking around  like brains  but this motherfucker  next to me  is a zombie  and I know it  like I diagnose him  yeah you know it  just cause he's  the zombie  so you say  just act like a zombie  and they'll never get you  yeah it's a zombie gene  do you have some kind  of zombie thing  Danny is a professional 
[01:57:30]  they definitely  there's like some kind  of like six cents  yeah yeah  you just know  how does a dog  how does a dog  know another dog  is a dog  they just know  zombies can smell  other zombies  do you hear  what the fuck  we talking about  it's suspension  of disbelief  you fucking asshole  I don't mind that though  the movie is a guy  that's chasing  his fuck  first of all  Liam Oldeeson  is chasing  his retarded daughter  around the world  he said it  I don't have money  I have a special  array of skills 
[01:58:00]  and I hated that too  on the phone  it's a great  that trite speech  here's what the movie did  after that  after the triteness  and after the old shit  he did what he was  supposed to be doing  yes made a B film  he fucking went  and did fucked up shit  to people  to find his daughter  it's not that I  listen to me  I'm not a movie snob  like I don't need  a perfect storyline  but when a storyline  is so awful  where he saves  the starlet  and at the end  he brings that  long-headed bitch  daughter of his 
[01:58:30]  here's your gift  here's  come meet the superstar  oh thank you  I answer my own door  I live in the suburbs  that fucking shitty  house she lived in  it was too many  shitty parts of it  and it ruined it for me  I love a good action movie  I love John Woo movies  I love fucking  I like the original  which John Woo movie  did you like  fucking hard-boiled  fucking the killer  well those are  those are his  those are the movies  before Hollywood got to it  that's what I like  how about Hard Target  no I don't  because see the Asian  the Asian movies 
[01:59:00]  are different than  American movies  but I can switch  I can suspend disbelief  like when Shao Young  Fat is rolling around  shooting 11 people  and not getting shot  I can suspend disbelief  and just enjoy that  like it's well done  but that's what  Liam Neeson was doing  it was terrible  soy sauce threw you off  I didn't like  so many things about  some of the action  was good  but the fucking  like the scene  you talked about  off the air  about where he shot  the other guy's wife  that was a great scene  they just don't do that  in Hollywood  it's one of the greatest  movie scenes  I've ever seen  he shot the guy's 
[01:59:30]  fucking wife  right in front of him  and this is what I liked  about the movie  and I agree with all the bullshit  the great thing about the movie  is that  it  he  he's not  fucking  around  that's what I like about it  so he's like  look man  and he's talking to this  old  his old partner  he's like look man  I need my daughter  and the guy's like  listen Liam  and he just shoots  the guy's wife  to go  I'm not fucking  around  tell me  what you know  and then wait a minute  wait  another greatness  the guy getting ready 
[02:00:00]  to make the speech  like  you Americans  can't kill me  you have rule  soon as the guy  welled his mouth up  to give a foreign guy  fuck America speech  Liam electrocuted him  he wasn't even gonna  I'm not fucking around  you stand for the  you have rules  and regulations  that you must adhere to  he put a sock  in his mouth  he  he  he  he connected it  to the light bulb socket 
[02:00:30]  and the guy's  getting ready to go  I'll never  Timmy  wait a minute  I forgot this part  he nailed his hands  to a chair  with his  with  with two spikes  in his hands  the guy's sitting  in the chair  and he's like  well let me  Jesus style  motherfucker  and electrocuted  that cocksucker  that's what I enjoyed  about the movie  all that stuff  is real strong  the storyline  is where I'm with Jim  it's a weak storyline  but he's 
[02:01:00]  he  but why didn't they  clean that up  and then they would  have a fucking  major  forrest Gump  is a weak storyline  like Forrest Gump  stinks  nah but it's  it's a little bit more  for an action movie  it's in a way  to me it's cheating  like they do things  they don't have  like fucking lethal weapon  it's a great  fucking cop buddy  action movie  like it's a great  movie  like I don't  so I'm not above  loving  I love  Schwarzenegger  I think he's the  best action star  ever  I can watch  almost anything  Schwarzenegger does  and suspend disbelief  but there was 
[02:01:30]  something so cheesy  about this  and I felt like  they cheated  I don't remember  Running Man  Running Man  was pretty cheesy  I love Schwarzenegger too  but Running Man  wasn't cheesy  I think  I see Patrice's  point because  I think they were  trying for something  else though  yes a good movie  like yeah  they were  yeah  but you know  you're right though  they were  with those other  action movies  it's like hey  here's an action movie  let's just fucking  throw it  we'll have Arnold 
[02:02:00]  fucking shooting  these guys up  and that  this one  I think they were  trying for like  a sentimental  kind of  more of an  involved story  a film  not just the  I think they were  really trying  for more than  just an action movie  a little bit  they were trying  a little bit there  and that's the parts  that get like  oh come on  how about you  call Interpol  and have them  get your daughter  instead of  hopping a flight  after hearing a recording  and then laying  under the bed  because you sense it  oh beat it  put a hat on  with that awful  hair dye  it comes down  to a hat  he's obsessed 
[02:02:30]  with hats  the bad guy's  running in sushi  on Liam Neeson's  head  I enjoyed  how much  Liam Neeson  was not playing  it just  he shot that  guy's wife  I said this is  this is one of  my favorite movies  I can watch  this over  just because  of what he's  fucking doing  we're never  going to get  anywhere with  this argument  it's a couple  I agree with him  it was a couple  of great scenes  but even Dolomite  had a couple  of great scenes 
[02:03:00]  you know what  I don't want to  get off the subject  though of movies  because this got  started the discussion  because of the  new Jamie Foxx movie  that is coming on  and I have something  to say about this  I have something  to say about this  bring everyone  to the table  what's the movie  about  I have no fucking  idea  some CIA type  bullshit  it's about  a guy  I saw the trailer  so basically  it's Gerard Butler's  daughter I think  something bad  happened to her  and Jamie Foxx  what does he go  to get her  and go under 
[02:03:30]  the bed  with a tape recorder  and soy sauce hair  he teases his hair  up with the condiments  it's soy sauce hair  fucking Kikomon shampoo  watch that  you'll never not  look at Liam Neeson's  awful fucking  soy sauce colored wig  it's fucking horrendous  I can't fucking deal  with that  so your point though  on the new  Jamie Foxx  oh yes  yes  Jamie Foxx  Jamie Foxx 
[02:04:00]  was on  wasn't he on  Living Color  yes  and he was a comedian  yes  and he did  impressions  yes  also  he then  does  a fucking  great impression  apparently  of Ray Charles  for a movie  yes  does a great impression  of Ray Charles  and now  he's a fucking  actor  doing these movies  he's not good  he's not good  here's why I hate being  here's why I hate being 
[02:04:30]  and this is why  we're always to the  end of time  which is 2012  thank god  black people  he says  it's all bullshit  it's all bullshit  dr steve says  fuck him in his  bubble universe  oh yeah that's right  we got a problem  with the  the physicists  all I want to say  is I  I hate to do this  because I  but that's a racial  attitude you're having  even though  even though you can  base it on  Jamie Foxx  not because he's black  it's because  Michael Keaton  got to be a  fucking guy  I'll throw him  in the same thing 
[02:05:00]  Jim Carrey  got to be  this guy  Tom Hanks  used to dress  as a bitch  in a sitcom  got to be this guy  but Tom Hanks  is a good actor  and why the fuck  can't Eddie Murphy  be that guy  Tom Hanks  is a good actor  Eddie Murphy  was a good actor  Jamie Foxx  is a fucking good actor  no he isn't  did you see this one  where he was in  the gold  he's a good actor  no  I don't see him  he's as good  as fucking  Jim Carrey  in  his quirky 
[02:05:30]  what's the  first of all  number 13  which had to  drive him back  to doing comedy  they kicked him  out of seriousness  but Robin Harry  Knuckles Williams  gets to be  a fucking  serious guy  all the time  Robin Williams  is a Juilliard  trained actor  he's actually  a real actor  Jamie Foxx  is a fucking  good actor  he's not a bad actor  Jamie Foxx  not a bad actor  this is great  this is racial  Anthony  no no no  I would tell you  if it was  I swear to you  there's too many  white actors  that get to be  fucking  not comedians 
[02:06:00]  anymore  I have called  him out in the  past  and I think  Jim Carrey  is a prime  example of  somebody that  was doing  comedy  this  the table  guy  he did  the wacky  fucking shit  and then they  throw him into  serious roles  and he sucks  an ass  the problem is  here's what  annoyed you  about Jamie Foxx  Ray Charles was great  yeah he did a great  imitation of Ray Charles  how about him  in Ali  as fucking  Bondini Brown  he did a good job  he was great  he did a great job  that guy  that guy  is a good  actor  man  he's a better 
[02:06:30]  actor than Jim Carrey  here's what was  annoying  he is a good  actor  but he was  playing Ray  all over  after the  award  and just  singing  it was like  shut up  it was more  just an  irritating  thing that he  was doing  he is a good  actor  but I'm  just sick  and tired  of seeing him  that stupid  movie where  they're in  the fighter  planes  he was  awful in that  it was called  stealth  yeah  stealth  but every  actor does  that  they get  their tour  de force  and then  they do  horse shit  Sam Jackson 
[02:07:00]  has it  him and  John Travolta  haven't done  a fucking  thing since  Pulp Fiction  except for  shit  that was  Pulp Fiction  they have  done shit  motherfucking  snakes on the  motherfucking  plane  what  is it  really  again  I fucking  look  I like to  play both  angles  Pulp Fiction  why the  fuck  is John Travolta  the leading  man  and what  you call  is not  the leading  I saw 
[02:07:30]  it as  Sam Jackson  Sam Jackson  was a support  actor  no way  Charles is a  bigger name  he had to be  Charles  was a  mother  he was  doing  nothing  the baby  shit  the baby  shit  he was  done  that's only  a name  size  thing  though  because  Jackson  was  relatively  he had  done  Jungle Fever  before that  but he  hadn't done  a tremendous  amount  of roles  you could  never put  him on  equal  billy  with  Travolta  I saw  that as  total  co-fucking  billing  why the  fuck  is it  no  they  weren't  because  he got  because 
[02:08:00]  John Travolta  was up  for being an  actor  no Oscar  no I  understand that  but  just watching  the movie  you thought  they were  I'm talking  about  I hate  Pulp Fiction  when Sam's  not in it  I fast forward  through  until he's  in the movie  Marcellus  Wallace  getting  fucking  fucked  is pretty  good  that was a  great scene  I'm just  saying  Anthony  I fucking  love to  trash  anybody  but  it's  too  many  fucking  old  white  dudes  at some  point  I have  to say  Tom Hanks  left  comedy 
[02:08:30]  he's  gone  but  Eddie  Murphy  still  has to  do  horse  shit  they won't  let the  motherfucker  do  serious  shit  he doesn't  want to  Eddie Murphy  is in a  position  where he  could  do  because  he's  Murphy  he's  one of  the  highest  drawing  box office  guys  still  like  his  movies  we all  go  he still  makes  fucking  50 million  dollars  a year  doing  like  he's  not  like  the  top  ten  guys  I think  that's a  credit to  fucking  Eddie Murphy  and a curse  for him  because he  did such  a fucking  great job  in funny 
[02:09:00]  movies  48 Hours  was probably  one of the  funniest  fucking  movies  I saw  one of the  greatest  movies  and it's  just a  great  fucking  movie  Gans  hey  Gans  nice  gun  he doesn't  want to  do a  drama  where  if  he wanted  to do  a drama  and wanted  to play  a murderer  or a  fucking  really  unlikable  guy  Eddie Murphy  is in a  position  where he  could do  that  people might  advise him  against it  Eddie Murphy  he tried it  in Metro  he tried it  in Metro  he tried it  in Boomerang  where he tried  to leave 
[02:09:30]  the comedy  thing  and he  and he also  he did it  fantastically  in Dream  Girls  I don't know  if you've  seen  I hate  musicals  I saw it  but he was  critically acclaimed  in that  he was great  in that  but that's  where every  comic  moves towards  fucking  Robin Williams  got to just  be a fucking  serious actor  at some point  he got to  just do  what he wanted  after Garp  after Garp  don't forget 
[02:10:00]  he started  with Popeye  and he's a  Shakespearean actor  and I'm not  saying that  I'm not  disrespecting  his  meaning  he gets to  be  he did well  at the box  office  if it goes  well at the  box office  then they'll  fuck it  but don't  forget the  Eddie Murphy  movies you're  talking about  didn't do  that well  except for  Dream  Girls  I don't  think it's  racial at  all  I think  it's  what the  people want  they want  to see  Eddie Murphy  being  goofy  Eddie Murphy  and as  far as  Tom Hanks  goes  him being  like the  funny guy  movies  it worked  but not  nearly as  successful  he went 
[02:10:30]  from big  to saving  private Ryan  he doesn't  do anything  funny anymore  you forget  if you're  born  after a  certain time  Joe vs.  the Volcano  Money Pit  Michael Keaton  got to be  Batman  who the fuck  made that  decision  that was  unfair to  somebody  like when  I see shit  where they  try to  give black  people  they try 
[02:11:00]  to give  us a  fucking  what do  they call  it  you know  bone  they throw  us a bone  I know  I was so  ready to  just start  jumping in  Jesus  for truth  why would  you do  that to  yourself  but when  they put  Michael Clark  Duncan in  as  on  Electra  when they  put him  in as  the  Kingpin  if you're  a fan  of comic  books  Kingpin's  a big  white guy  and when  they put  Michael Clark  Duncan in  as a 
[02:11:30]  chance  a crazy  casting  I'm going  what the  fuck  why would  you  don't make  white people  black for me  motherfucker  he's white  yeah  yeah  just do  the right  thing  so when  you  say  Jamie Fox  did this  man  everybody  does that  Jamie Fox  is doing  exactly  what the  fuck  everybody  else  does  do  bad  movies  after he  does  this  great  thing  good  great  for  Jamie Fox  but I  don't  find  Jamie Fox  to be  believable  when I  watch him  I just 
[02:12:00]  don't think  he's good  yeah  I don't  think  he's good  what  does he  do  that  sucks  when I'm  watching him  in a movie  I'm totally  taken out of  the fucking  movie  the Tom  Cruise  thing  the Tom  Cruise  collateral  he was  bad  oh  collateral  yeah  yeah  I  couldn't  buy it  I  I'd  watch him  and like  it takes  me out  of the  movie  it can't  it does  I don't  know why  I think  his bad  movies take  you out  of the  movie  like  just  the  poor 
[02:12:30]  nice  headshot  you just  don't like  him  he was  great  in Ali  he was  good  he was  amazing  to this  day  Michael  Keaton  bothers me  how he  got to  move out  they kicked  him to  the curb  though  he doesn't  get to  do movies  anymore  after Pacific  Heights  it's kind  of a  downhill  go to  his IMDB  it didn't  work out  well  believe me  there are  plenty of  white actors  I think  that  did the  same  thing  and suck  not enough 
[02:13:00]  they don't  throw enough  white actors  to decide  he must  have pissed  somebody  off  man  it  depends  on what  you're  making  Kevin Costner  how does  he get  to continue  to be  an Oscar  not so much  though  with him  too  but he  makes  one movie  every so  often  and it's  a fucking  four hour  epic  he directs  him  and he  directs  him  a lot  of times  so you  know  produces  him  like it's  his project  like fucking  what's his name  also from  lethal weapon  Danny Glover  no no  who plays  the next  again  in 2012  another 
[02:13:30]  nigga  president  sitting on  the end  of the world  Hollywood  doesn't even  give a fuck  I wish to  God I could  hit the lottery  please  God  cause  this  why would  you go to  Burlington  Coat Factory  Mel Gibson  Mel Gibson  fucked himself  with all that  Jewish  anti-Semitic  no you know  what  he runs  his own  shit  but it's  his own  shit  he had to  pay out of 
[02:14:00]  his own  fucking  lethal  weapon  money  to put  those movies  out  he said  fuck  Hollywood  Hollywood  isn't ready  to embrace  fucking  Mel Gibson  and give  him movies  he's got  to do  the shit  himself  now  he fucked  himself  he did  a movie  in the  Mayan  language  and it  was great  Mel Gibson  is a bad  fucking  director  he is great  man  he's got  some talent  he's great  that's good  shit  and he's done  some garbage  too  the man  without a 
[02:14:30]  face  conspiracy  they all  have  that wasn't  a bad  movie  that was  dumb  and Ransom  I saw  on TV  Ransom  wasn't bad  I liked  Ransom  what happened  to Rene  Russo  what the fuck  Hollywood  what should have  happened to her  she got old  she was around  because she was  good looking  they should at least  have a show  they have a show  about everything  just announcing  who's done  what happened 
[02:15:00]  to Jane  Triplehorn  who  remember  funny looking  Jane Triplehorn  she played  the wife  and she was  in Waterworld  and she played  Tom Cruise's  wife  fuck  yeah  her  what's the  lawyer movie  she did  Philadelphia  no she was  in The Firm  The Firm  yeah  who  she did look  good  somebody just  said her  career's over  yeah  she's done  she's in  big love  now  but when you  get demoted  from movies 
[02:15:30]  to TV  yeah  because they  all want to  go from TV  to movie  which means  Christian Slater  yeah  when did he  when did people  say he's over  you're right  can you just  let me know  when a  motherfuckers  career's over  he's  he's on  Curb Your  Enthusiasm  on one episode  I just saw  oh really  he's doing TV  Rene Russo  is a good example  she was in every  other movie  for a while  do they make  bad decisions  they start doing  bad  you're right  what does happen  sometimes they're  just gone  they fucking  smack one of  those Scientologists 
[02:16:00]  in the face  they turn down  their invitation  to the church  and they're  out of Hollywood  Florence Henderson  by the way  is on TV  she's had work done  but she looks  fucking unbelievable  she's gotta be  a thousand years old  that's Mrs. Brady  she still looks good  I guess the Brady  Bunch is 40  is that what they're  saying  oh really  the Brady Bunch  is a 40 year old  are we looking at  a 70 year old  broad right there  I think  oh yeah  my girl called me  yesterday  said she was  on Wendy Williams  yeah  Florence Henderson  they was gonna  show the clip  and I didn't  notice  she said 
[02:16:30]  they charge you  $7,000  to show  Brady Bunch  clips  that's why  some of these  fucking shows  are not showing  the clips  on this run  because it's like  I'm not paying  $7,000 for  you're shitting me  they talked about  on Wendy Williams  the other day  wow  that's crazy  $7,000  I would just  give her fucking  $500 and say  act that out  here you go  get that sausage  guy to fucking  here we'll bring  a fucking wheel  and a doctor's  skeleton  act with it  I'd rather you 
[02:17:00]  attack Sam Jackson  for Lakeview Terrace  than Jamie Foxx  for this movie  with Gerard Bubba  no you know what  though  Samuel Jackson  is good  he's just been  in shit  is he good  though  he's good  in bad movies  everything  everything  he has become  after a while  you even  happens with 
[02:17:30]  comedians  oh that's beautiful  you forget  how to be  yourself  like you forget  you go  oh shit  I forgot  so Sam now  he has two  things he does  he gives you  a big eye  turn look  like  like  what  you know  what you're  talking about  Willis  almost  like  and then he  goes  watch  Lakeview Terrace  he wants to put  on that  furious  vengeance  that face  with the big  eyes 
[02:18:00]  I will  strike down  upon thee  it's hard to  follow yourself  I've seen him  in Shaft 2000  it's on cable  now  it's just  and you told us  to watch that  other movie  Lakeview Terrace  we still haven't  watched it  you didn't watch  Lakeview Terrace  I'm gonna watch  it today  it's shockingly  bad  it's terrible  oh good  yeah  I mean it's  really bad  it's so bad  it's good right  it's on the level  what did you  top bad  what did you  think of him  in Unbreakable  Unbreakable  I liked him  in Unbreakable  underrated  I like Unbreakable  I've watched it  probably four fucking times 
[02:18:30]  I think it's great  it's a great movie  they needed a little  more action  in that movie  it was slow  it was too slow  it needed to  just be sped up  a little bit  it was a little more  cerebral  dude  that was a  tremendous movie  because the powers  he had in that movie  he's like  fuck I want to see  a little more of this shit  I want to see  a little more  of that shit  yeah  what's he doing  the seventh sense  he's done nothing  good since then  he's getting out of that  he's doing a warrior  picture about a little 
[02:19:00]  kid who's the  who's the  the whole world  has to try to kill  and he's  he's like the best  fighter that ever lived  and he's going to  lead the world  it's some  it's some heavy  it's just look like  it's going to be  a bad motherfucking movie  insane  a bad fucking movie  man  you could say that again  I had enough of him  in the surprise endings  oh really  they all live on a leaf  fucking drop dead  asshole  one good movie  the happening  the happening  fuck the happening  that was a terrible film 
[02:19:30]  and then the water horse  or whatever that was  I didn't even see  the fucking lady in the water  I didn't see that  and the happening  where the trees  make you kill  I was like wow  M. Night's done  that was the  Shatner's wife  by a biopic  you can feel  you can feel  his pressure  to do well  after somebody  says you're good  you be like  holy  I think it happened  to Quentin Tarantino  where people like  he's a genius  after they call you  a genius  if you're not  angry enough  at people  like you go  if you start  believing in any way  yeah  that's a tough 
[02:20:00]  follow up  he started just  becoming  the guy that says  Quentin Tarantino  liked this movie  he stopped doing  movies  and then he did  I thought he was done  after that stupid  double feature thing  I loved that  yeah I liked it  I hated both  of those fucking movies  with the bitch  with the gun foot  I'll kill that  that fucking was  the stupidest  fucking movie  I like those dumb movies  that was just a  conceptual kind of  thing though  a lot of people  didn't like it  it was a good idea  the problem was  that you saw them  back to back  you see them individually  they're alright 
[02:20:30]  none of that  it was presented  as big budget  kind of here's  Quentin's big film  it should have been  a small movie house  kind of release  I loved Kurt Russell  I guess in glory  Bass is bringing him  back to something  he was doing well  so he came back  but M. Night Shyamalan  I think this is his  last horror  yeah  he never was  is that the kid  for the fucking  the last airbender  yeah man  this is one kid  and the whole world  is trying to kill him  and he's kicking ass  why'd they just  fucking gang up on him 
[02:21:00]  yeah really  no the movie shows  the whole world  he's in this tower  it shows the whole world  coming towards this tower  and trying to fuck this kid up  alright  that's stupid  that is so dumb  but wait what  does he have nuclear weapons  as dumb as what  what does he got  as dumb as what  what does he got  what does he got  that he can fight  the whole world  are we gonna learn  at the end  he lives on the  fucking Taconic Parkway  like fucking  another piece of shit  Joaquin Phoenix movie  it's stupid 
[02:21:30]  does he have nuclear weapons  in these retreats  not the past  how's he gonna  hold off the world  you see he has a stick  a stick is gonna  hold off the whole world  he's a fucking  cartoon character  god damn  would they just give him  food poisoning or something  exactly  how's he getting his  fucking food  does he need a dead  therapist to talk to  in a church  yeah really  rotten kid  when does real  when do we get so real  I just don't like it  if it's bad  one kid against the world  that's an amazing  I understand you gotta  like kinda 
[02:22:00]  oh it's a remake  of a cartoon  on Nickelodeon  oh yeah  he's remaking a cartoon  Dr. Steve told me that  they texted me  I bet Michio Kaku  wouldn't have known that  what  Dr. Steve hates  Michio Kaku  of course he does  because he knows  Michio Kaku brings it  yes  M. Night Shyamahan  is like a river  he comes from the ocean  into a boring shit puddle  the text I got  from Dr. Steve  after fucking  his last appearance  was so great  it's like  the universe  is like 
[02:22:30]  tiny bubbles  soap bubbles  and when they  come together  and it was like  Dr. Steve goes  soap bubbles  fuck him  it's like  fuck him  I loved it  here's the thing  Kaku is obviously  a physicist for real  he knows all this stuff  he just  communicates in a way  I'd like to see him  teaching a class  because he's the head  of physics at  I think NYU  he probably says  the same stupid  analogies  talk like a scientist  I'd like to see him  doing equations  and stuff like that  he's the only guy 
[02:23:00]  that does that  I'd love to see him  doing equations  and talking about  stuff like that  in his language  or talking to  he doesn't talk  to other physicists  like that  I bet he does  no he doesn't  oh it's like  a gummy bear  you chew it  and then there are  people  so we should have  him in to do  just that  do an equation  in front of us  he wouldn't know  not with that  dumbing down shit  he'd laugh  he'd go  ha ha ha  you know  the way you want  me to talk  is almost like  that Disney movie 
[02:23:30]  with the little elves  in the mine  alright  we physicists say  I want to see him  with another physicist  talking  he's not going to  probably talk the same  way to another physicist  what do you think  they go  oh what's happening  baby  dynamite  Tarantino fans  checking in  Patrice  Tarantino fans  checking in  Patrice  they  you know  Tarantino hasn't  had a bad run  really  not like others  he didn't have  a bad run 
[02:24:00]  that's true  he really hasn't  had a bad run  but what he did  was  he dropped out  he dropped out  he didn't continue  to make bad shit  he took a little rest  and then like  John Woo  here's what America  does to a lot of  people  and that's why  I love  Chow Yun Fat  yes  did he go back  I love John Woo  they tried to come up  now Jackie Chan  said fuck it  I'm staying in America  but John Woo  and Chow Yun  they came over  and they made  Chow Yun do  two shitty movies  one with the kids 
[02:24:30]  from Role Models  Replacement Killers  and Replacement Killers  where he was starring  with Mira Sorvino  well Mira Sorvino  and he did  two bad  or maybe even  three bad  American movies  and that fucker  left  he went back  and he said  suck my dick  I'm an icon  in China  I'm not gonna come  here and be  some god damn  fucking gook guy  some fucking  to these  B  fucking Hollywood  actors  and John Woo  did the same thing  even though I like  Hard Target 
[02:25:00]  I love Hard Target  as an American movie  with John Clonson  who by the way  has made some  great action movies  he gets no  fucking credit  at all man  because everybody  mixes him up  with the fucking  Dolph Lundgren  no no  the guy with the  fucking little ponytail  the friend  Barry Seagal  yeah  because people mix him up  with Steven Seagal  all the time  I don't think so  at some point  he became a joke  but Time Cop  is one of the great  like entertaining  little movies  you can watch  all day  but at the end  of the day  I love John Woo 
[02:25:30]  on them  because they  dropped out  so I will say  that fucking  what's his name  dropped out  Quentin dropped out  yeah  and so he hasn't  done a lot of  bad movies  I'll say whoever  is a fan of him  he didn't do a lot  of bad movies  he takes his time  he doesn't need to be  out there constantly  I got something else  on Jamie Foxx  the whole reason  why I might hate him  you motherfucker  leave Jamie alone  that stealth movie  where he's the  fighter fucking  pilot guy  I don't like  any black  fighter pilot guy  that's talking  fucking 
[02:26:00]  fucking jive  I've never seen  I watch the  military channel  constantly  and when there's  a black guy  talking about  and he's fucking  talking about his  plane  he's like  let me tell you  a little about  the A-10 Warthog  this is a tank  killer  it's a wonderful  vehicle  it has the gun  up front  a lot of  places  for weaponry  and this  motherfucker  is an educated  military  motherfucker 
[02:26:30]  and then you  watch Jamie Foxx  it's like  oh yeah  I'm kicking some  ass in my plane  well  fuck that  that's Hollywood  writing  I hate it  I have a white  equivalent  yeah  alright  Top Gun  they were hippity  dippity in Top Gun  they were skipping  around in Top Gun  you know  I'm not looking  at Top Gun  like it's a realistic  fucking movie  I am  but  why are you  looking at  Stealth  because  like it's real  no because  any of that  that fucking  you know 
[02:27:00]  it's like  you put a  fucking  hip hop guy  in the cockpit  what happened  I'm going to spit  in turkey  Jimmy's covered  in turkey  it's awful  Tyson's on the  back of a truck  on fucking  Thanksgiving  looking at this  turkey all over  Jimmy  you can't get  Patrice excited  while he's eating  because it just  goes everywhere  it's funny  oh fuck  I'm saying  why  why  because that  made a little  more sense  even though  they were  that was a  little more  nah  see  that's not fair 
[02:27:30]  here's what I feel  the dialogue in Top Gun  was a little hokey too  you got a problem with old black Jamie Foxx  just say it  I don't like Jamie Foxx as an actor  but don't try to say it's not black  though  he annoys you as a black guy  can I be honest  no  there's some white guys that annoy me  because they suck  and they're white  like  the mixture  makes me sick  I don't know  I don't know  we'll come up with one  no I swear  I would tell you in a second  if it was racial  it has to be  because your example 
[02:28:00]  of stealth  Top Gun  was even more  first of all  stealth is so much more  of a  imaginary  yeah I know  there's a bunch of fucking  stealth pilots  those fucking planes fly  they're so  Top Gun  was more  of a  movie  that was  it was close to like  Iron Eagle  it was like  that was great  Chappy  it's more  climb high  play the tape  it's more  real  so Top Gun  was you know  with Kelly McGinnis  or whatever  walking around 
[02:28:30]  whose career  for somebody  says she's finished too  oh she turned into  you see what she looks like now  wow  she's an abomination  wait till you see  what she looks like now  and Kathleen Turner  they dumped her off too  I don't know  they just dumped people off  Kathleen Turner's on  Kathleen Turner's on  Californication this season  exactly  she's finished  look at Kelly McGinnis  Will Smith  how the fuck does Nick  that's not a good  how does Nicholas  find that other one  he's a couple  he's a couple  that's a good pick  she has a haircut 
[02:29:00]  like Club Sort of Kenny  Danny will find it  bottom left  no Danny will find it  it was the one we were  yeah it might be the one  from the left  bottom left  bottom left  but there was one  we were looking at  that's her  that's her  that's why  she's not in movies  anymore  that's who Tom Cruise  was fucking  she looks like  Quasimodo  horrible  her eye is in her cheek  yeah that time's a bitch  Patrice  Will Smith  I love Will Smith movies  why  there's a lot of them  that I really like  I think  I am legend was good  and shit like that  but you watch 
[02:29:30]  Enemy of the State  and the same thing  that pissed me off  in Independence Day  the motherfucker is  jive talking  in his fighter plane  I hate that too  stop it  it's not gonna  they're not making you  a pilot  if you're  shucking and jiving  to your fucking plane  motherfucker  wait a minute  again  I have a white example  alright  the same movie  your boy  was named  wrong  in the church  and then the mother Buddha  he's terrible  he's playing around  in the plane  yes  fucking  no Australian game show 
[02:30:00]  fucking blackface guy  by the way  your boy  Harry Connick  Harry Connick  and by the way  Independence Day  is a great example  okay  look  that movie  was the greatest movie  I've ever seen  until after they attacked  after the attack  the movie  I turn it off  after the  after the fucking  Statue of Liberties  is raped  and every scene  it's like  you know 2012  at some point  the Statue of Liberties  pussy gonna be showing  the book's gonna be 
[02:30:30]  over her head  and she's underwater  but when  when that spaceship  when the spaceship closes  after we attack  done with the fucking  end of the movie  and  yeah  it annoys you  with that whole  thing  like what you're doing  but it is a movie  what point would he be  if he was  not doing  what he was doing  yeah  I know  you know what I'm saying  I guess it's cause  I watch too many  fucking  real military shows  and I see these guys  that are real  fucking pilots 
[02:31:00]  they have no personality  they're born for that  you talk to an old  Vietnam vet  they  you talk to an old  Vietnam vet  they hate the war  they hate how they do  these kids  they turn them  into these robots  yeah  and these non-thinking  people  will just do anything  they want  so who wants to see that  it's the same thing  as why I got mad  when Dana White  was mad at Brock Lesnar  every interview  we know this is a  gallant sport  MMA  but these guys  their interviews  are like  you know  I just started  Bunchman and John 
[02:31:30]  we had a great button  it's just boring  and for Brock to come out  and go  I've kicked his fucking ass  and you know it's real  I like that a lot  I loved him  when he did that shit  because everybody  wants to have everybody  be robotic  so that shouldn't  bother you  at all  because that's where  radio  they want radio to go  so at least have  a motherfucker  in there going  man I'll kill  a motherfucker  I hated him  punching his  this is suspension of  disbelief  that bothered me  okay about that movie  that fucking alien 
[02:32:00]  these aliens  tremendous  they weren't even  outside of their  they were in machines  yeah  so he  welcome to  earth motherfucker  he punched a machine out  and then that machine  he dragged it  all the way to the desert  and then that machine  killed everybody  with it's mine  yeah  the one that  Will Smith said  suck my balls  motherfucker  welcome to earth 
[02:32:30]  I do hate that part  where it's like  okay  black guy  I'll pull  everybody  with a punch  it's unnecessary  you don't need him  shucking and jiving  through the movie  it ruined it for me  when he started doing that  and men in black too  it's right in black folks  it's like no  it was good up to that point  just be a guy  his acting was good  I was enjoying  what he was doing  and I am legend  he's not  fucking Will Smith  the black guy  he's not the black guy  that's how I want to see  Will Smith  I wasn't looking at  Will Smith going  oh it's the black guy  scientist  oh the black guy 
[02:33:00]  fucking army guy  I'm a big Will Smith  I'm a big Will Smith  I'd say  if you had a choice  from Schwarzenegger  Will Smith  maybe John Claude  there's a few people  and then there's directors  you know what I mean  Scorsese  where you go  okay if I'm stuck  on an island  who I'm gonna watch  you know what I mean  Will Smith is up there  with his fucking movies  but they do have him do  but that's  I know what they  that's what we have  to fucking do  that's what people  want to see  he didn't do it 
[02:33:30]  in I Am Legend  though  he didn't do that  nonsense  I like the Omega Man  30 times more  than I like I Am Legend  really  I love the Omega Man  damn you  dude  because in the Omega Man  it wasn't monsters  it was  it was  confused  diseased  people who had a purpose  these guys  these things were just  and I don't like  any movie ever  and this is why  I hate a cast away  any movie  where it's just  self-congratulating  acting 
[02:34:00]  where I'm gonna act  by myself  watch me  watch my acting  just me  me and my dog  me and a ball  here it is  I don't give a fuck  I Am Legend  was fucking great  you liked it better  than Omega Man  I don't remember  I have to see Omega Man  it's too dated  to really like  like I would love  when's the last time  you've seen it  pretty recently  like since I Am Legend  I fucking love that movie  but the makeup  on the fucking  bad guys  on fucking  oh it's bad  it's antiquated makeup  so kinda  yeah 
[02:34:30]  it's just remake  white afros  yeah big white afros  and shit  the disease  was white afros  it's just like silly  I also didn't need  I will say I Am Legend  I didn't need  the Bob Marley speech  we get it  he was lovely  we know  we should take a break  gonna get into  Jacktober  or something else  after the break  Jacktober  that's why I like  watching the  I also watch  the History Channel  so I  I get to see  the Tuskegee Airmen  those motherfuckers  are great  now if you want to  talk some shucking  and jiving pilots 
[02:35:00]  they just took  a bunch of black guys  and threw them  in like planes  and they kicked some ass  yeah with some  syphilis blankets  but it's funny as shit  because you talk to them  they were fucking  fighting  they were flying like  51s and shit  and they're just like  where they send us out  let me tell you  the Germans  the Germans was coming  and we was a  flat out formation  I'm like  that's a motherfucking pilot  can I just please 
[02:35:30]  before we go  you know  we always  I never play victim  on this side  but is it possible  for somebody  to tell me  really  what the fuck  did we do  and what did we do  for motherfuckers  that hate  niggas this much  we fucking  what the fuck  these old guys  who they  they just  they smack them  in the face  with tuberculosis  they just do 
[02:36:00]  horrible shit  and  and then  there's some  90 old nigga  just  man  I lived  I'm fucking  still alive  I lived through  pitch feet  I lived through  all the shit  that kills us early  and  why the fuck  can't  we just get a little  white boy  you know  god damn man  y'all did go  through a lot  of horse shit  the guy was saying  I dropped some bombs  on Germany  and I come back  and I couldn't even  use the same restrooms  as the white peoples  and you're like 
[02:36:30]  holy shit  this guy  fucking  flying through flack  being shot at  and he gets back  and it's like  hey  yeah  you can't use that  well perhaps  play devil's advocate  perhaps you've never  seen a white lady  winked at  I'm just saying  perhaps you've never  seen  the ugliness of that  something changed  there was  there was a  balanced period  there  where  I think  the civil rights  movement  really made an  effect  but then  and this is the 
[02:37:00]  reason  I'm answering  your question  why people  look and just  go  fucking  motherfucker  what did we do  what the fuck  did we do  for white people  to hate us  so much  the teeter-totter  has tilted  to a point  now where  white people  feel like  we  can't  say  or do  anything  to a black  person  without having  the scarlet  R  fucking  tattooed on  you  for being a  racist  you mean  historically  it's  yeah  historically  I said  it had to  build up 
[02:37:30]  to a point  I think  it was just  and I agree  with you  let me tell you  why I agree  with you  on this one  this is why  the Obama  thing  my thing  is  I'm like  you know  if you walk  the streets  with people  you're amongst  people  you're amongst  people  you're amongst  people  everybody's amongst  people  there was nothing  in the attitude  of the world  on a day-to-day basis  which made me go  there could be a black  president  and it be for real  yeah yeah  you know  and like I said  when I drove to your house  and that dude  was just like  he actually was 
[02:38:00]  on the phone  talking  and he pulled  that phone  off his face  to stare at  what the fuck  is this guy  doing riding up  in my neighborhood  he was calling me  he was  was this for that  it was a pool party  and you had a towel  and a fedora  fucking lime green  sweatshirt  lime green  yes  it's like  he blended right in  I get it  like again  I'm not victimizing it  but it's just like  it's like look man  the problem is 
[02:38:30]  that  and this is the problem  with blacks  with whites  and whites with blacks  it had to be  legislated  like  your niceness  your decency  had to be  made into law  as opposed to going  this shit is  life is just  let's all be cool  I have to force you  to fucking like me  and that's why  it's fucked up  because why do you  but where  what the fuck is it  where's the  the heartfelt  shit  meaning 
[02:39:00]  look I don't want  you to have  the big races  I want people  to be able  to fucking  say shit  about  about  fucking  Obama  it's about  this like  the Rush Limbaugh  thing  they like  we don't want  the players  won't play  for Rush Limbaugh  and I go  do you see  the rest of the  owners  you motherfucking  do you presume  that the owner  of the Pittsburgh  Steelers  ever said  nigga  Jerry Jones  that melted  white guy  has been a decent 
[02:39:30]  motherfucker  his whole life  I'm saying  just cause  that's what it is  everybody wants  icing  and no one  wants the shit  to be right  inside  so it don't  make no sense  half the country  or a big part  of the country  did want it  to be right  for the right  reasons  and they knew  the only way  to get it done  was to legislate  but a lot  of people  if you want  to go way  the fuck  back  and find  out where  this came  from  obviously  when slavery  was  when slavery 
[02:40:00]  was abolished  the black  people  just became  a burden  they were  unskilled  there was  no way  they could  just be  hired for  jobs  they became  like a  burden  on the  country  and I  think it  was looked  at that  way  especially  down south  because not  only did  it become  a burden  but it  became a  hey  we can't  own you  anymore  yeah but  that's like  if I go  buy a lot  of soda  from the  fucking store  then all  the bottles  become a 
[02:40:30]  burden  after I  fucking  drink them  and leave  them in the  house  they are  a pain  in the  ass  you gotta  recycle  them  you gotta  get them  jobs  you gotta  give them  money  oh  well they  weren't  trying to  give them  what they  would promise  which is  probably  why they  became  they only  became  a burden  because they  weren't  given  that is  not in  the  fucking  emancipation  proclamation  no it's  not  but in  actuality  the  emancipation  proclamation  is just  full of  it's basically  you know 
[02:41:00]  the owners  got  that was  Lincoln's  fucking  way  first of all  the owners  got money  for their  free slaves  because they  like hey  you motherfuckers  out of business  they got money  for that shit  man  a lot of  shit  slavery didn't  end  southerners  slavery didn't  end  where did  they get  money  from the  north  from the  country  there was  a war  from the  country  that's  what I'm  saying  and it  was done  so that  the niggas  could fight  in the  war  it couldn't  be  from the  country 
[02:41:30]  if down  south  you have  a southern  plantation  owner  that is  fucking  fighting  for the  confederacy  and  Abe Lincoln  signs the  emancipation  proclamation  to cripple  the south  because  now all  of a sudden  they got  black guys  working on  the plantations  they could  send their  guys out  and fucking  fight the  civil war  Lincoln  frees the  slaves  saying  now you  ain't got  fucking  labor  they got  money  how did  the plantation  what from  Lincoln going  alright I'll  pay the  enemy  who is the  confederacy  I thought  Danny was  typing 
[02:42:00]  something  up  but  they  got  money  from  who  from  the  government  they got  money  there was  two governments  then there was a confederate government  and a fucking union government  there's nothing in you  there's nothing in you  like that  the idea of fairness  there's nothing in you  that says look man  and I'll give you this  this is why I always try to get white people ticked  but here's what I  realize about white people  and this is what I learned  and again I'm generalizing  white people don't give a shit  and that's 
[02:42:30]  these  these reasonable  rational  racial arguments  they don't give a fuck  they don't care  I was just kidding  pretending I didn't give a shit  I was mad about that  as much as taken  I was just joking  so I'm just saying  it's hard to have these conversations man  where it's like  you know  I don't want people to go  oh poor little negro boy  I'm just saying  there's a part  there's a part of motherfuckers  that should understand  how a motherfucker feels 
[02:43:00]  and that  there's some fairness involved  that you go  you know I can see  I can see both sides  and I can see  look I see the side  as a white guy walking around  and you can't say  I think Obama  is such and such  without being called  a fucking racist  I fucking understand that  but look at  what the fuck  you set yourself up  it's the  it's the  it's the CG plant  you set that up  by not being decent  he reads what he says  I didn't plant any seed  the thing is  I didn't plant any seed  neither did my parents  or grandparents  it's fucking 
[02:43:30]  yeah but you have  you're living the fruit  of a white guy  meaning  you take the white guy  thing  and you're not a white guy again  you're a fucking immigrant  do you understand  what that white skin  and black skin thing does  it  it makes such joint forces  where a guy  your people  got over here  what  in 1900  when did your people  get over here  probably yeah  early 1900  so how dare you  how dare I  how fucking dare you  look at a black dude 
[02:44:00]  like you better  but that was the whole time  where the immigrants  were coming over  and having to fill up  a country that needed  people that worked  and fucking were productive  because they wouldn't hire niggas  if we wasn't working for free  then they wouldn't go hire us  so they bring in white  slaves to make a couple of dollars  and then you look at us  like  ugh  but you're fucking  you're fucking black  I believe there are  certain skills  that are inherent  to certain cultures  what skills  did y'all bring over  besides 
[02:44:30]  masonry  mafia  cement  mob  organized crime  thank you for spaghetti  taking money from  fucking little  little general store owners  yes  for protection  you know  we were the police  for the fucking  wise guys  that's not the  emancipation proclamation  lincoln sees the act  as a military necessity  we need the emancipation proclamation  that's right  punch up the emancipation proclamation  I love how  you wrote it on the back  of a cocktail napkin  I love how patrice  of course not  I love how patrice 
[02:45:00]  asked one question  as we're going into break  that needs a three hour  fucking answer  I know  we're looking for historical documents  I just want to point that out  we did an hour and a half  of radio  before we go to break  one more question  it's a quick little wrap up question  and he asked this  fucking question  that literally needs  three to four hours  to answer  you motherfucker  I'm peeing in my  fucking pants right now  all I want to know  is why do y'all hate niggas  that's it  I'm just stepping back  that's a quick question  before break  sure  but Anthony  instead of Anthony  saying you know what 
[02:45:30]  blacks did get fucked  he's going well  technically they became  a burden on them  right right  that's a question  that needs a whole week  you motherfucker  I just mean a number  of us  I can't let you pass on that  you know  what the fuck  I think masonry  is inherent to Italians  mason  he thinks mason  masonry is an inherited gift  they're a bunch of dummies  put the bricks  they're very talented  with cement  a monkey could do that  they're very talented  with cement  the Irish  were very talented  with beating up people  small dicks  exactly 
[02:46:00]  so they became  the police officers  why don't we just  pee and shift  so Patrice could keep going  what the fuck  one more question  Patrice  one simple question  why weren't we hired  and they go  well it wasn't racist  it was because the Italians  were born with the gift  of making walls  they needed to bring  these fucking  ginsos over  that fucking  rotten fucking food  and I'm sitting here  going this is going to take  a week to sort out now  a week between these two  you're so fucking right  Jesus 
[02:46:30]  one little question  before we're going to break  I thought it was going to be  a yes or no question  it could have been  and he just  everything wouldn't give it  he wouldn't  and he just won't go  hey man y'all had a bad break  man I do understand  and he said  you're getting that  from Anthony  he said  he said  Italians brought over  masonry  yeah exactly  masonry  like we'd all be living  on the fucking field  without these idiots  to fucking make bricks  there'd be worms  squalling down your houses  motherfucker  I think that certain things 
[02:47:00]  are inherent to certain cultures  y'all would have been  y'all would have just been  the two little pigs  if it wasn't one of us  oh here's the uh  little uh  thing from the  emancipation proclamation  yes  and upon this act  sincerely believed  to be an act of justice  warranted by the constitution  upon military necessity  that's an excerpt  from the fucking  emancipation proclamation  yes  that's an excerpt  considerate judgment  of mankind  and the gracious favor  of almighty God  here you want to read the whole  yes we do  that's a long ass document 
[02:47:30]  after the break  we're not reading this  before the break  no I'm going to read it  during the break  so I just have  the one I'm talking  don't let anthony read it  because he'll stop  and boo  boo  right at the end  it says  p.s.  I have been drinking  heavily  exactly  there's a vomit stain  on the top of it  everyone wondering  what jk  at the end of it  mentioned  and p.s.  damn  these niggas  can't do masonry  we need somebody  to come over here  bring over some dango  yes 
[02:48:00]  the slaves  should be freed  lol  did lincoln  put an lol  yes he did  put the two dots  and his smiley face  that's where it comes from  oh shit  no questions  patrice  going on  no more  you're not allowed  to ask any more questions  I gotta leave  for virginia  so I'll see you guys  godspeed jimmy  godspeed  that's right  let's hope  let's hope  I don't hit  an italian made wall  because you all know  how solid those are  they're very solid  it's an inherent 
[02:48:30]  trait  in the culture  yes they were just  born into it  that big italian  vag open  and the kid  falls out  with some wet cement  look  it came from  years of building  like  being good at  nothing else  hey stupid  put the wall up  no  the roman empire  building thing  if you look at  Rome  there's a lot of  great architecture  and masonry work  and this  became inherent  to the italian  if you  if you  if you look at  cement companies  they're all 
[02:49:00]  italian run  yes the italians  did a great job  on the pyramids  there's not  one bit of  cement on that  fucking thing  oh that's true  they didn't need  cement  they figured out  without cement  yeah they did  why don't we  take a break  is that alright  with you patrice  uh i just got  one question  what is the  meaning of life  a big picture  of a pussy  should pop up  on the screen  jimmy have fun  in virginia beach  the funny bone  tonight through  saturday  alright there you go  we'll continue

[02:55:30]  story before  jocktober  let's hear  home invasion  this is  long island  yes  see  these things  pop up  all the time  two men  dressed in  work uniforms  complete with  utility belts  knocked on the  door of the  home behind me  they said they  were with  con ed  and as soon as  the housekeeper  opened the  door they  violently shoved  their way in  the unsuspecting  housekeeper was  thrown to the  ground and bound  with plastic ties  hearing the  commotion the  homeowner came  from his bedroom  and was also  attacked  they eventually  were able to  secure him  with plastic ties  and duct tape  police say the  men were  threatening to  kill and 
[02:56:00]  rummaged through  the house making  off with cash  and jewelry  the homeowner  whose children  were across the  street at school  at the time  is just glad  no one was  seriously hurt  thank you  thank you  stunned neighbors  say claiming  to be from  con ed  should have  been a dead  giveaway  con ed  it's not  around here  it's national  grid  police say  never open  the door  unless you're  100% sure  most people  wouldn't know  that though  they would  just assume  yeah it's a  different power  company  i don't think  you would  know what to  do in that  situation  what  you're walking  out of your  bedroom  what  he didn't 
[02:56:30]  hear the  commotion  so  did he hear  the commotion  he wasn't  armed  that's what  i'm saying  you wouldn't  be armed  in that  situation  fuck yes  i would  you insane  you think i  don't walk  around the  house  what's the  mistake there  the housekeeper  is going to  just be stupid  are your  housekeepers  allowed to  open the  door  no  you should  put a memo  out immediately  because i  bet you  they would  open the  door  no  no  no  you  gotta keep  it safe  tell them to

[03:21:00]  voiced black guy  wow  yes you  can't tell  listening  that's  strange  kind of like  you  well  I mean I'm  technically  all white  technically  I'm glad you're  at least putting  that word in there  well I mean  100%  we already  talked about  the fact that  your mom  gets something  something  something happened  I mean it  couldn't be  further back  your black  features are more  prominent than  fucking  Patrice's  yeah  you're not  back in the  day  yeah  what's your  features  just my  hair  your hair 
[03:21:30]  look at the  eyebrows  your nose  the way  you're  basic bone  structure  your bottom  your top lip  is white  but your bottom  lip is  that's true  it's divided  in mid mouth  you do have  the big  lower lip  and you have  hair bumps  that's true  white people  don't get  hair bumps  yeah that is  razor bumps  from  because your  hair is  coarse  black hair care  aisle  is where  I gotta go  to  yeah  you do  see  you do  oh yes  yes  dude  you gotta  ask your 
[03:22:00]  moms  yeah  look  what happened  I'm old  enough  just level  with me  what's going  on  can we get  an official  answer from  your mom  yeah like  seriously  all joking  aside  and then have  somebody in your  family  if you're not  if she didn't  cheat  explain you  I mean  explain you  exactly  so then how  yeah we need  an explanation  yeah we really  and I'm gonna tell  you something  you can record  do it  what's the  haps  it's like  it's old  news  so you don't  see it  but every  time I look  at Sam 
[03:22:30]  it's like  I look at him  for the first  time  like I'm like  what's going  on with Sam  trying to figure  it out for a  long time  here's an odd  thing  the hair is  so black  I mean  yeah  the eyebrows  do you  understand  that  you and  your lovely  girlfriend  who at  some point  do you plan  on ever getting  married and  having children  I mean I  could see that  happening at  some point  yes  does she  know  does she  actually know  that it  could happen  that  recessed 
[03:23:00]  recessed gene  that's in you  now  can come out  and I mean  you'll have a  fucking  complete  black baby  question what  she's been up  to  even though  it's black  you think  the skin  could be much  darker  no I'm  thinking like  everything  big ass  afro  fucking  hey moms  what's up  right out of the womb  it's been known  it's been known to  happen  for real  for real  it's been known  to happen  you've never  asked you  you've never 
[03:23:30]  looked in the mirror  and go  like  you've never  gone man  I really want  to know  I really want  to know  are you adopted  no  oh  I mean  my brother's  got  uh oh  I mean  what  my brother's  got curly  hair  not like  me  it's more  white person  curly hair  not barely  Sam  but it comes  down  when it grows  out  it's pretty  damn curly  too  like  you know  it's like  the girls  like it  and everything  do a what's  the haps  with your mom  and dad  it's those  bumps  yeah yeah  it's just  another piece  of evidence  Sam  you got  sickle cell  anemia  no 
[03:24:00]  not diagnosed  no  do a what's  the haps  with your mom  my uncle  although he's  related to  Thomas Jefferson  we all know  the Thomas Jefferson  story  I have an uncle  with coarse hair  I've never seen  any bumps on him  but he does  have like  tight curls  that's like  keloids too  black people  get keloids  the hair bumps  and sickle cell  anemia  those are three  things like  white people  don't get  yeah I've never  I've never seen  do you have any  darker relatives  no  no 
[03:24:30]  but I have no  his mother man  and this probably  hurts man  but his mother  his fucking  mother  slept with  somebody else  I think it goes back  yeah I feel like  it might have gone  back a few generations  it's not  first of all  it's probably on my  mom's side  you're Italian  right sir  you look very  Italian  yeah  Mr. Kumia  yeah  little olive  colored skin  no matter how much  you try to whiten it up  it's just  olive  it's true  I understand  you have  what you have  five six generations  out of nowhere 
[03:25:00]  a white family  somewhere  there was a  recessed  yeah  there was a  recessed him  gene  in there somewhere  this guy  this guy is a  mixture  of  two people  his moms  and somebody  else  but I will say  this  this will probably  deeply hurt  my mom  but  my grandfather  was gone a lot  when my mom  was coming up  wait  so what does that  mean  he cheated 
[03:25:30]  but cheating  was so much  different back then  so you  and where  are your family  from  Kentucky  so he was  sneaking out  fucking  nigglets  no I'm saying  it would have  had to happen  but is your  mother  white  you think  grandma  no  my grandma  would have  had to cheat  and then give  birth to my mom  like grandpa  was away  you can't just  your mom's  gonna kill you  for that statement  that's what  would have had  to happen  so when grandpa  was away  the fucking  guy comes over  and goes  hey baby 
[03:26:00]  his mother's  somewhere right now  and gets grandma  unlocking something  she said  I knew this  was gonna happen  this day  this day  would happen  she blows the dust  off a book  she's gotta give him  a document  you're gonna get a document  this weekend  really  yeah yeah  it's happening  I don't know  she's going into  some kind of chest  right now  as far as I'm  they say it's just  what it is  if you find out  that it's true  a nappy net  albino  black  white thing  if you find out  it's true  are you gonna start  coming in late 
[03:26:30]  you're an abomination  if it's  an abomination  you used to date  only black girls  too  well I mean  I dated  I had only  dated black girls  see that  that was his thing  that  right there  that's some  connection  that you have  it's nature  it's nature  it's fucking  instinctive  with your little peeps  wow  let's do  were they  satisfied  let's just put it  that way  I never received  a complaint  you got a big hog 
[03:27:00]  Sam  listen this is not  to be discussed  in such a public  he has a  because he has a  swagger of a guy  that looks like him  and I've seen him  without his clothes on  at your house  he's a fucking  when I had him  posing  for the party  like an ice sculpture  taking pictures  he's a fucking  mess  so he has to be  packing wood  especially  if you only  exclusively want to  date black women  I just want to know  because  that's pretty brave  to date black women  when they're used  to the big  cock  I just  what it is 
[03:27:30]  that's pretty brave  that means you got  a big piece  I like the people  inside  it's so interesting  to me because  every time I look  at Sam  I just  it's  I can't look at him  and not like  go shit  what is he man  he ain't no white boy  he ain't no white boy  no white boy  that's like  that girl that  ran me up at Target  that time  that I told you guys  about  that just looked at me  oh right  I said hey  how's it going  and she said  what are you  what are you  what's that  and she didn't mean  ethnicity  she said  what are you 
[03:28:00]  what are you  what a  total lack of tact  yeah and she would not  accept the  two white parents  she said no  I said it might be  something way back  and she said  well if it is  it's strong in you  yeah  way back  how old are you  I'm 26  yeah it was  way back  26 years  9 months ago  something happened  back in 83  back still  man anything  no  you don't have a  milkman  I mean not that  I'm not that 
[03:28:30]  I've ever met  do you see like  an ice cream truck  parked across your  house  just always look  and gave you  free ice cream  just say hey kid  I just  just for you  no not that I recall  you've got to do a  backstage with Sam's  mom  I'll interview her  over the weekend  yeah we would like  to really find out  what this is all about  your sister  your brother  do you have pictures  of your mom's  not on me  I mean  she doesn't look like  him  you seen him  wait I'm trying to  think now  yeah I mean  she doesn't look  black  no you wouldn't  but she has like  she's got kind of  tight curly hair 
[03:29:00]  but it's not as  tight as Sam  it's a white  it's white people  curly hair  yeah yeah  tight I like that  instead of nappy  tight  I like that  I haven't even heard  that fucking shit  that shit in my eyes  it's tight  can we do  Jacktober  we can  fuck  we keep  forgetting about that  people are screaming  and distracted us  get to Jacktober  with his blackness  so Sam  what do we know  about Kramer and Kelly  they're saying Kelly's  the black dude  and Kramer's  the chick  I think  what  I don't know  anything about that  it's insane  but  it's B104 in Allentown  it's like a  it's another fucking 
[03:29:30]  man woman team  just  the guy is Kelly  the girl is Kramer  that's crazy  listen  Troy Kwan tipped me off  because this is one of  Troy Kwan's favorite  radio shows  from his hometown  he loves  he loves Kramer and Kelly  in the morning  otherwise  you know  why would he tell me  about this great radio show  alright  they play the hits too  that's what I like about them  oh wow  they'll talk  but they'll also play the hits  do they play all the hits  it's not advertised  but most of them  well Kramer and Kelly  have the list of the cities  with the ugliest people  and prove their genius 
[03:30:00]  by starting with  number one  yeah because when you're  in radio  and you have like  the top ugliest  you know cities  yeah  if you have a list like that  you want to start  with number one  of course  of course  and then it gives people  a chance to tune out now  and go somewhere else  and find real radio  B104 Kramer and Kelly  749  while it's in  the ugliest  where the ugly people  come from  it's the cities  with the ugliest people  in the US  in the US 
[03:30:30]  alright let's hear it  what's number one  number one  is  really  hey you know  they were number one  last time this poll came out  you don't do it like that  I don't think that  what was number one  Philadelphia  but you know  don't you count down  no they start at number one  why  that's the point  we're making it  they go to number one  but Opie  just get the information  out there and move on  you're supposed to start  I know  high and then go low  and then never give them  number one  and then drive them nuts  and they yell and scream at you 
[03:31:00]  years later  that is the dumbest thing  you're gonna start with one  number one  last time this poll came out  I don't think that  I don't think they're the ugliest  well they  these polls don't lie  you're right  these are very scientifically  conducted polls  alright where are the  beautiful people  well they're all  the beach places  oh  San Diego  Miami  yes  Los Angeles  I gotta tell you  I think that's  I think Midwest  has the fattest people  in the country  right  isn't that where all the 
[03:31:30]  I would think south  fried cooking  yes exactly  yeah  them too  but maybe  maybe they're fat  but they're beautiful  on the inside  well I think Philly's  getting a bad rap  you think so  I think so  I don't know  you agree  you get pretty ugly  down there  alright  I guess it's one of those  that seemed like a good idea  on the paper  before they  started the break  you can always tell  that a couple has  really good chemistry  on the radio  when they hit  four topics  in 60 seconds 
[03:32:00]  did they  I don't even know  well they started  with the ugliest city  right  then she asked  about the prettiest city  which he obviously  had no information on  then she mentioned  where the fattest people  come from  then he was talking  about food  and then they went  back to the ugliest city  that break was awful  well they're just  not on the same page  Opie  Kelly  as we move on  because I don't even  know what to do  with that clip  to be honest  that's just horrible  radio  just let it lay there  just let it lay there  okay  Kelly gives today's  health tip 
[03:32:30]  thank god  we're all healthy  people here  we all you know  good morning  and thanks for  waking up with us  here on B104  your health tips  are brought to you  by Star Pontiac  Buick GMC  and today's tip  wreck your leftovers  if you find yourself  dining out  and lingering over  conversation at the table  but you don't want  to keep sampling  the leftovers  on the table  you don't have  a doggy bag  what you want to do  is cover what's  left on your plate  with pepper  or another spicy  condiment  that will stop you  from grazing  no matter how long  you sit there talking  and that's your  B104 health tip 
[03:33:00]  who the fuck  would do that  you destroy your food  because you can't  help yourself  excuse me  while us two adults  have this conversation  after dinner  I'm going to pour  everything on the table  I'm going to play  with my food  who the fuck  would destroy their food  at a restaurant  no one has  no one has that  well that's if  you're sitting there  picking  I could understand  if you want to  you know  douse it in something  so you don't  keep picking at it  well there are  a lot of restaurants  douse it in bad radio  it's very 
[03:33:30]  it sounds  very reasonable  to me  there are a lot  of restaurants  where calling  the waiter  and say  excuse me  could you wrap  this up  I'm finished  is an impossibility  thanks  I appreciate it  just put a big  dose of bad radio  on it  so you'll look at it  and just go  I don't want that  that was pretty much  waste of time radio  there's a health tip  that's not a health tip  that's stupid  now let me ask you this  can we be fair  to some of these  junktober  they 
[03:34:00]  what I like about this  it is their job  hold on  what I like about this  we're not  searching out  Sam can listen to this  show for a week  and find the really  bad stuff  this is just a quick  sample of stuff  they did yesterday  that's what I like  about this  how do you know  the difference  between forced to be  bad and bad  well I think  they're just bad  but can you pick out  like okay  they have hope  if they were allowed  to do it  I understand that  you know  every show can't  do what we're doing  edgy just in your face  radio 
[03:34:30]  we get that  but it's just  like the dishonesty  yeah when they start  cracking up at the end  of saying something  that wasn't even a joke  yeah  and they don't want  to be the same  act that's been going  on for years  like just no sarcasm  at all  like no cynical  nothing  that word  doesn't exist  anger or nothing  that doesn't exist  they are deadly serious  when they're doing this  there are no resentment  that they have to do it  at all  there are places  they just will not go  no matter what  well people don't want  to wake up early  in the morning  and hear that stuff  shut up 
[03:35:00]  yesterday  this broad was doing  the Paul Anka story  and called him  Paul Unka  Paul Unka  she said some guy  named Paul Unka  some guy named  Paul Unka  Mr. Unka  and the guy  sort of laughed at her  but barely  and what would we do  we would have killed  the person  for saying Paul Unka  right  for a half hour  and that's just  an honest thing  half hour at least  would have been  the whole day  but they're not  acknowledging the obvious  the bit would be  right to mispronounce  names  for an hour 
[03:35:30]  of course  Elton Joan  really  that's all we  all we know  and they don't understand  that they're just  in the middle of the pack  with their radio show  Paul Walliams  for about 20 minutes  the people listening  want you to exploit  that shit  if someone says  Paul Unka  you can't let them go  no  how about a cup  of sunka  I think someone said that  I think we did that  I think I think 
[03:36:00]  someone said that  we learned really quickly  there weren't a lot  of words that  rhyme with  Unka  the teachers  are on strike  Kramer and Kelly  spend their time  talking about it  and how it's  somewhat cold  outside  it's  somewhat cold  it's not winter yet  but it's  somewhat  chilly  well  Saucon Valley  has off today  the kids do anyway  teachers are on strike  yeah  didn't that already happen  no  I thought they worked it out  they never  no  they decided to work on 
[03:36:30]  without the contract  you know why  Maury's a cocksucker  they're interviewing  look  right there  that shot  they're interviewing  these midgets  these kickables  and they're making sure  the camera is way above them  to make them look  even smaller than they are  they're already small  to begin with  but make sure you get the angle  from way above  making the little thing  look right up  at the camera  she has to look up  at the camera  this one is hot though  yeah this one  this one is hot  in proportion  she comes out in a little  outfit  this one looks 
[03:37:00]  she looks good  let's see  here she comes  man this one's  coming out  she's almost regular  she's just short  she's more really short  we should have just watched Maury today  instead of this jock table  let's see if she's got  those little stubby legs  no she don't  she's wearing like a dress  or some shit  she's fucking  here comes Jasmine  here she comes  Jasmine  you're beautiful Jasmine  let's see  she's got a little too much  clothing on  she's got a little legs  she's got a little  she's in proportion  she's better than the other one  yeah she's sexy 
[03:37:30]  Lady Gaga  a little better  yikes  you might have to  she's a comedian I think  nah she's singing  she's a singer  oh okay alright  alright back to  let's learn about  the teacher's  I love my life  short people  got  no reason  I don't think  they were thrilled  with that song  no  I thought they worked it out  they never  no  they decided to work on  without the contract  and everything  they voted last night 
[03:38:00]  to  walk out  now they'll be out  for 15 to 17  17 days  according to this  unless something happens  are they actually  outside picketing  do they do that  or do they just stay home  I don't know  because it's cold  no it's not really cold yet  it's still cold  you don't want to be  outside picketing  it's not that really cold  bitter windy cold  well no  that stinks too  but this is not fun  but this is for a point  Laura  you'll be out in the cold  if you're trying to make a point  why are you yawning 
[03:38:30]  oh shit  holy shit  would you listen to that  that is  I can't wait  to renegotiate  by the way  I can't wait  to renegotiate  by the way  chat  chatter  going back to that  before Jogtober  my friend  I wanted to get  that rap thing  I just wanted to say  some guys from Philly  the hardcore  Cool C  Steady B  they are 
[03:39:00]  two rappers  responsible for the first  on duty murder  of a woman policeman  in Philadelphia  oh yeah  one is in  and they had good careers  ahead of them  that they fucked up  right  Steady  the hilltop hustlers  so I just wanted to add that  alright  those are real gangsters  real gangsters  for real  Cool C is on  death row  for real  Kramer and Kelly are  back to Jogtober  now this fine show  they're accepting  brah donations  yeah  watch out for Kramer  getting a little wild 
[03:39:30]  in this clip  it's a thing for cancer  like breast cancer  is this the brahs across  put river name here  no they're going to  take a big  balloon  like a blimp  type thing  and then they're going to  bomb  a building  with the brassiere  Zophie  is what they're going to  be doing  brah bombing  yeah  yeah  alright Sam  this is  brings up a good point  to end  to end Jogtober  you guys  you can find  an Opie and Anthony  segment  oh god  to end Jogtober 
[03:40:00]  alright  one that we haven't heard  I mean  you can't sit here  and make believe  when you're Jogtoberish  yeah  we can't make believe  that we were always  like we are today  you're absolutely right  brother man  brother man  we had some moments  so we'll allow you guys  to find one  Iraq and me  we'll get together  to find one new  that's what I'm saying  it can't be an old one  no  alright  that'll be an uncomfortable day  but I think it's  it's only  it's only right  to end Jogtober  with a look back  at what we used to do  do you still catch yourself  being Jogtober recently  hell fucking no  nowadays 
[03:40:30]  hell no  the second part of our  AAF career  is when  it really  turned around drastically  probably a little  Jogtoberish still  at the end of the  AAF days  but by the time  we came to New York  it wasn't in our mind  that we were doing that  hell fucking no  well  hold on  we were  kind of forced  to do  some crap  at NEW  we said no  musically  we said no  to the giant  Pop-Tart  my friend  that's Jogtober  I know 
[03:41:00]  that's Jogtober shit  but were we doing  two for Tuesdays  we fucking yelled  and screamed  in between the twos  but weren't we  I don't know  if we did  we were mocking it  the whole time  that was the problem  we had with the Jogs  over there  the whole time  I don't know  hell fucking yeah  yeah  alright  someone's saying  no you didn't  motherhuckers  yeah  well the point is  you gotta  be true to yourself  eventually  be true to yourself  you have to  I mean  I understand

[03:43:00]  right AJ  he's not here  Kramer and Kelly  asked today's  challenge question  what's the challenge  question about  I see you put  a show prep  bid alert  next to this track  well something  we haven't explored  is that  these prep service  websites  they'll give  all the parody  songs that every  show uses  but they also give  show topics  like talking points  no way  here's some things  you can talk about  today  here's a question  shows don't even  think of their own  questions to ask  the audience 
[03:43:30]  this job is easy  to begin with  and now they're  you can go online  and say  you can't even figure  this shit out  on your own  you can't come up  with a topic  every morning  to talk about  here's a good idea  for the question  of the day  kill of the day  kill of the day  sure  and so this is  Kramer and Kelly's  question of the day  okay  which could sound  familiar to some  of our jocktober  keep it right there  for now Sam  here's Kramer and Kelly  doing the question  of the day  today's challenge  question  today's 710  challenge question  half of all people  do this  within a week 
[03:44:00]  of breaking up  with someone  what is it  610  720  1041  we'll take  your guess's name  dude that's the  same question  as the other jocktober  wait is that what  you're getting at Sam  yes  who did it  I forgot  Rocky and Sue  in Wilkes-Barre  Pennsylvania  this is Allentown  Pennsylvania  Rocky and Sue  did it a week  and a half ago  it was the same  question  and Sam's got  that clip  yes  alright here it is  answer that we're  looking for here  third of the women  do this  right after they 
[03:44:30]  break up  with their  significant other  okay this is  Michelle we haven't  talked to yet  first thing they do  after a breakup  one third of the  women polled  said they do this  it is  cut their hair  cut their hair  you are correct sir  yes it is  cut their hair  cut their hair  yes  wow  so they said  a third of the women  they can't even  come up with a question  a third of the women  now Kramer and Kelly  said half  half  could it be a  different question  we can only find out  by getting to the  answer  maybe  maybe it's a  different answer  now we go back  to Kramer and Kelly 
[03:45:00]  Kramer and Kelly  721 and 34  at the B14RCN  studios  Laura what was the  question to them  half of all people  do this within a week  of breaking up  what is it  610-720-1041  hello  hey I like to play  the 710 challenge  yeah what do you think  the answer is  go out on a date  no  thank you  thanks  B104 hello  good morning  go on a date  not a date  thanks  B104 hello  hello  is the answer  cutting their hair  it is a  cutting their hair 
[03:45:30]  all people get  haircuts within a  week of a breakup  wow  how about that  huh  I guess a new look  yeah  shake things up a bit  wait a half or a third  how about you shake  things up a bit  and come up with  your own shit  so this person  may have been  driving through  Wilkes-Barre a week  and a half ago  they happen to find  themselves in Allentown  and look  hey  lucky for me  the radio station  is asking  the exact question  the same boring question  by the way too  who gives a shit question  yes that question  that people will be like  why 
[03:46:00]  that must have been  something they thought  of this morning  is actually published  for people to say  hey morning shows  out there  here's a great question  and the stations  pay for the privilege  of being able to  log on to this website  that says  here's a good question  to ask people  dig up a fucking  question that  and I know this  it's really not hard  to do this shit  on your own  without the use  of these services  guess where Scorch  got half of his  brain cell stimulators  a quarter of all 
[03:46:30]  people that break up  do this  wait a minute  what is it  he would 100%  ask this question  at 625am  any given morning  this is a perfect  brain cell stimulator  brain cell stimulator  my answer would have been  suck on a dog dick  he wouldn't have made it  why  just to make it fun  well because lucky  for us and every  single other radio show  at the time  all phone calls  are of course recorded  while the song is on  that way if there's  any rowdy callers  we had to do that 
[03:47:00]  because we didn't  have a delay  yeah  yeah  we gotta  been through this  whole thing  we gotta do that  that sucked  alright here's the  little midget  ah whatever  I'm done  what is this  a goth midget  I think it's  mini chris angel  yeah it's mini chris angel  and see  they have to  look  he's got a little  baby straight jacket  ew  fuck this thing is weird  he does understand  people have seen him  just cause he's a midget  though  you know  the point patrice made
