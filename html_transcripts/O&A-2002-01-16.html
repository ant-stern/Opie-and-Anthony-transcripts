<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The January 16, 2002, Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of "Whip 'em Out Wednesday" (WOW), showcasing listener-submitted photos of their vehicles displaying WOW signs, hoping to attract women flashing them.  The hosts reviewed the online gallery on Foundrymusic.com.  This was followed by a scathing critique of Bob Buckman’s morning show on Q104, contrasting their own style with what they perceived as the Q104 show's awkwardness and comparing it unfavorably to their previous station.  The show then transitioned to analyzing sexually explicit content from HBO Family's "Middle School Confessions" and MTV's "Real World: Chicago," focusing on underage children discussing sex and drinking.

A surprise guest appearance by Rudy Boesch from "Survivor," and Ed, a contestant from Boesch's new show "Combat Missions," followed.  Both veterans engaged in conversations about the John Walker Lindh case and the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, employing frequent offensive language and crude humor.

The show then featured a phone call from a woman claiming to be Keisha, a 21-year-old virgin interested in losing her virginity on the air.  The conversation involved sexually suggestive language, racial stereotypes, and attempts by the hosts to verify Keisha's identity, ultimately leaving them doubtful about her authenticity.

The program continued with numerous listener calls detailing their children's sexuality, particularly focusing on pre-teen and teenage children identifying as gay or expressing same-sex attraction. Callers, including Joe, shared anecdotes about their children's experiences and relationships, employing vulgar and offensive language.  The discussions covered parental reactions and the challenges faced by both parents and children.  The segment also included calls with humorous observations and crude language.  The show mentioned Adam Ferrara's appearance on "The Job" later that evening, and upcoming segments including a "Naughty Nighty" contest and further discussion of "Whip 'em Out Wednesday." A caller mistakenly believed they had won $100,000 but received a candy bar instead. The show concluded with a comedic performance by Pablo Francisco, referred to as "the tortilla boy."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I need my coffee.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Wow.  Wow, I need a drink.  What's the matter, Psycho? Mark, the bars closed today.  Look at him. He put his headphones on. He thought his mic was on.  I'm part of the show.  Turn my mic on.  Don't worry, this isn't the best of. 
[00:00:30]  It is truly January 16, 2002.  Here's the blindfold.  Nice to see you.  Psycho, the bars here in the studio.  All right, welcome to the O&A show.  Anthony, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday. I want to get that right out of the way.  It is indeed.  We love Whip'em Out Wednesday, don't we?  Yes.  Just a little something-something that we came up with a very long time ago now. 
[00:01:00]  Seems like yesterday, but it's been at least five years now.  Maybe six.  It's been quite a while now.  Now, the concept's very easy, right?  Yeah, you put WOW somewhere on your vehicle, whether it's one of the Kofi and Anthony show-sanctioned bumper stickers or just anything.  WOW written on the dirt in the back of a truck.  Or the bootleg stickers.  The bootleg stickers you might see around.  Whatever.  We like the homemade WOW sign.  Yeah, put a WOW on your vehicle, and if a girl is so inclined, she will see the WOW, pull up next to you, and flash her lovelies right at you. 
[00:01:30]  That's right.  And also, we like seeing WOW on the rides out there because it also shows that you're supporting the show.  Right.  I see a lot of them out there around New York, that's for sure.  So, if you need a WOW sticker at this point, go to opiananthony.com.  It'll explain how you can get your WOW sticker.  Or take it upon yourself and make a homemade one, okay?  Okay, Opie.  Three o'clock.  One minute past three.  One minute past three. 
[00:02:00]  Well, God damn.  We can talk about that in a sec.  Yeah.  I just want to fizz up the WOW thing really fast.  Foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y.  Music.com.  Foundrymusic.com.  The link is on opiananthony.com.  There's a nice section on there called WOW ME.  And girls from all over the country are now just sending in pictures of themselves flashing.  How beautiful.  And they're becoming little stars.  Little starlets.  Starlets.  And every week there's at least one or two brand new WOW ME shots. 
[00:02:30]  So, check it out for yourself.  You can spend an hour just checking that out on foundrymusic.com, okay?  Such a hot word.  The WOW ME section.  Starlet.  What is he saying over there?  Mark.  Mark's been leaving racist messages on our answering machines.  What?  What?  Am I racist?  No.  I don't know.  We can't take it.  I can't take this, idiot.  Oh, come on.  I'm known for saying mom's box.  Your mom's box. 
[00:03:00]  Girl, I'll grab a restaurant jam.  Call your mom's box.  Eat at your mom's box.  And people know me for dad, dad, dad, dad, dad.  There you go.  So, yeah, we've been very entertained here in New York.  This is probably the worst radio show ever being done across the street.  We were just having a ball with it.  You know something?  I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to bash any show just for the sake of bashing it because it's on another station, not the same company. 
[00:03:30]  Believe me, there are plenty of shows, infinity broadcasting shows we'd love to lay into.  So, it has nothing to do with a company or anything like that.  There was a show that was on this very station, the Radio Chick Show.  Remember?  We go back a few months back.  How long has it been?  I don't know.  It's been a while.  I think she left a few years ago.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know how long. 
[00:04:00]  And then they weren't on the air for a while.  And then they get an offer to go over to the Classic Rock Station here in New York, Q104.  Which has a pretty loyal Classic Rock following.  Bob Buckman was the local Long Island rock jock for many years.  He's now the morning guy and the PD of that station.  And he's done a pretty good job of making it the Classic Rock Station in New York. 
[00:04:30]  He's very good at time and temp.  There you go.  Time and temp and hitting the post.  And playing the Classic Rock.  And talking about how he knows Billy Joel.  So, he's, I believe, I'll be honest with you.  Nice guy, though.  I believe he's done the most you can do with a Classic Rock Station.  You know what I mean?  Then, I guess they offer the Radio Chick and Butchie and Chuck a job doing mornings over at the Q. 
[00:05:00]  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  I cannot see how she took that goddamn job when they say you've got to do it with Bob.  Look, I've got nothing against Bob.  You know, I used to listen to the guy at BAB growing up.  Whatever.  The guy, you know, you do a couple of little things and then back to the music.  Fine and dandy.  But if Opie and I were ever approached after losing a job at a station to get a job at another station,  but the condition is you've got to, it's got to be, you know, the morning guy and Opie and Anthony. 
[00:05:30]  Like, it's got to be the Bob Buckman, Opie and Anthony show.  I'd say, you know, hey, thanks for the offer, but I think we're going to look at some other options.  Because, quite frankly, it is the most uncomfortable, awkward situation I can say I've ever heard on the air.  Which makes it fun.  I finally, now, don't get me wrong, you might want to tune in.  I'll give you that.  You might just want to tune in to give it a listen. 
[00:06:00]  Listen, it's, you know, they have their own thing that they do, that they were doing here in N.E.W., fine and dandy, whatever you want to do.  And Bob does his thing.  These two things do not go together.  It's very awkward to listen to.  Entertainingly awkward, I must say.  Bob takes pride in the music and introing it and time and temp.  It doesn't fit.  And that's all the stuff that the Radio Chicken and her gang used to make fun of. 
[00:06:30]  Used to joke about and stuff and you just feel it's uncomfortable.  So now it's cool because it's the only job you can get?  Yeah, I don't, I don't get it.  Now it's cool to say, yeah, CCR, all right, yeah, yeah, I like it.  I mean, and the slam subjects that, you hear Bob and it's like, hey, how you doing?  It's 8.54, six minutes to nine o'clock.  Hey, we got some Creedence Clearwater Revival on the Bob Bunkman and the Chick Show. 
[00:07:00]  It's like, hey, hey.  And no one has the balls to say something over there.  It's a little awkward.  I don't see how, like I said, if Opie and I were offered a slot where we had to go with the existing morning guy,  it would be, no, still be an Anthony show.  This is what we do.  We're very confident in our program.  And we're not going to take a job with a third guy thrown in. 
[00:07:30]  You know?  Oh, Norton doesn't count.  He's barely a human.  And we don't know how to tell him to get lost.  Believe me.  We picked him.  Oh, that'll be on the message board.  It's not like, you know, it's kind of awkward to hear the time, the temp, the intros and outros of classic rock songs,  and then all of a sudden you're trying to slam into a talk show.  All of a sudden Bob's a shock jock and the radio shakes into playing classic rock. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, Bob is saying things that, you know, especially if you're a Q listener here in New York in the morning  and you've listened to Bob Buckman since he's been there, or maybe out on Long Island,  this is the furthest thing from what Bob has been about for all those years.  Hey, yeah, Jew humor.  Hey, yeah.  No, I understand, Chuck.  Sometimes the colored get me all riled up, too.  This is like Bob is the most middle-of-the-road kind of guy. 
[00:08:30]  You know?  He's like the, he's just the real nice guy.  Charity begins it off.  Bingo.  Real nice guy.  I would never say anything to offend anyone.  Very charitable with the charity begins at home thing he did for many years.  It's so out of his character.  For some reason, he sold his soul.  I don't know.  Now it's shock Bob.  It's shock Bob.  Shock Bob.  And the radio chick, Megan Bleach, she likes classic rock all of a sudden.  Hey, we got Robert Clary on the phone.  Where are my sound effects? 
[00:09:00]  You know, I just, it's, I just, I had to be honest about it.  That's my take on it.  Now someone's saying, hey, O&A, didn't you start out the same way the chick did?  How?  No.  We came to New York and we were on a station that was playing a lot of crappy music and  we told everyone how much we hated the music from day effing one.  Oh, we'll get the goddamn tapes of our first show here at N.E.W.  goofing on the classic rock because we thought it sucked and it did suck. 
[00:09:30]  And people forgot that we used to play Rod Stewart baseball.  Yeah.  That's right.  Instead of playing the music, we used to pitch it in.  We'd take a Louisville Slugger and hit it.  One after another, we smashed the Rod Stewart library.  There were times like, because we've talked about this, when you work for a music station,  you don't pick your own music and they had a list.  There were songs that were so god-awful bad that we refused to push the button and Anthony  and I would sit here for about ten minutes.  Remember once we had to have the cleaning lady came in and we made her push the button because 
[00:10:00]  we didn't want to play this song.  We would not take credit for playing the song on the radio.  And the reason this station here in New York is a talk station and for some reasons I'm  sorry, is because of, we finally decided, look, we're dying here.  We're dying a slow death playing this god-awful music.  So we decided to stop playing the music and just talk.  And it worked.  We got some numbers and they decided to flip the whole station to talk. 
[00:10:30]  Because we went against what management thought was best and stopped playing that music.  So no, it's not the same situation.  Not at all.  I just think if they want to do something and make something of it, I don't think that's  a good venue for you.  Shock Bob and Classic Rock Chick.  And Norton Line's rehashed.  Yeah, that was funny.  Well, that's no surprise.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  There you go.  A little critique on New York morning radio.  There you go.  Use it as you will.  I don't care.  I learned something today.  It's all in the delivery, Norton.  Right.  It's all in the delivery, my friend.  Anyone can say it's as funny as ass cancer.  But it's all the way you say it.  The way Norton's been saying it for a year on this show, and I'm sure much longer in your  personal life.  But, you know, whatever. 
[00:11:30]  That's nitpicking.  All right, Anthony.  It's, yeah, like we said, it's Whippin' Mount Wednesday.  A few phone numbers we have to give out today.  For the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including, uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Buffalo!  Buffalo!  Coming on strong, baby!  Buffalo, you sons of bitches.  Making Washington look silly today, my brothers! 
[00:12:00]  You bastards.  Hallelujah!  I know what they were all listening to when they were working the snowblowers and the  plows and the heavy equipment, getting that snow out of there.  It looks like a lot of people were listening to the Opie and Anthony show when they were  shoveling their roofs.  Yep.  Maybe they were just trapped in their houses and couldn't get out.  And they had no choice.  I don't care what the reason is.  You guys, you came to the table.  This is how effed up this Opie and Anthony syndicated radio show is.  Washington outright hates us. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We will not sugarcoat it.  They hate us.  You read the message for us?  For whatever reason, they hate us.  They think we stink.  I read the message for us.  It's over.  It's over in Washington.  We're done.  Finished.  We have failed in D.C.  There's things I'm reading.  Yeah, we had a book.  We had one ratings book.  We're done.  We had a shot at it.  We had a shot.  We took a shot.  That's it.  It's over. 
[00:13:00]  At least someday we can say, hey, we took a shot at it.  It's done.  It's done.  So we stink really bad in Washington.  Three months.  Done.  But the same radio show.  No different.  Uh-huh.  No different.  It's killing in Buffalo.  In Buffalo.  Boston.  Philly.  Cleveland.  New York.  I don't get it.  We're much more gooder in Buffalo.  Uh-huh.  Much more gooder.  Much more gooder. 
[00:13:30]  So gooder.  There's only one station gooder than Buffalo.  Uh-huh.  And that's the station in Cleveland.  Right.  But Buffalo a close second.  And I hate to say it, my friends, New York in third place at this point.  Uh-oh.  But still good.  New York good.  Cleveland more gooder.  I know.  Buffalo more gooder.  Uh-huh.  And Cleveland much more gooder.  Much more gooder.  Right.  So thank you to Buffalo.  Seems you get this type of humor. 
[00:14:00]  Thank God.  Not getting any guff from Buffalo.  No.  Let's not go into that again.  That was kind of fun yesterday.  We got some fun stuff today, man.  Those clips from that goddamn HBO child porn show.  I don't know what the hell that was.  Yeah.  What's the name of the show, Rick?  It's called...  Middle School...  Middle School Confession.  Middle School Confession.  Yeah.  It was on HBO Family.  HBO Family, this is called.  This is called HBO Family. 
[00:14:30]  Let me tell you what this show entails.  Junior high school children ages 12 to 15.  Somewhere around there.  12 to 14, talking about drinking and having sex.  There you go.  That's what the show is about.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  You'll hear things from 12-year-old girls about how they like to...  How she went out one night and her boyfriend was using digits. 
[00:15:00]  You'll hear that.  You'll hear about how a girl says she's technically untouched, except for her mouth.  Oh, 12-year-old.  As she tells this story through a face full of braces.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  On HBO.  On HBO.  How does she go back to school?  How do they go back to school?  How does her mom let her go back to school?  Hey, you're the HBO BJ girl.  Hey.  By the way...  Hey, and you're the mom of the HBO BJ girl.  I saw you on HBO. 
[00:15:30]  How's your daughter?  What?  What?  What?  What?  The name of a 33-year-old comic comes up on HBO.  You're about to run.  It's not me.  One of the middle schools featured in this is our own Stinky's Middle School.  Stinky went to the middle school that...  The gay guy...  The gay kids hang out.  Gay kids.  Yeah, gay kids.  Seems like gay is running rampant at Stinky's Old Middle School.  The gay boy talking about how he had sex in the backseat of a car. 
[00:16:00]  At 12.  At 12.  Gay...  The gay black kid talking about how he...  Yes, he is feminine.  And the gay lesbians with the braces.  Yeah.  The one that looks like Stalker Patty.  Young Stalker Patty.  They're talking about sex and stuff like...  You know, who doesn't know what's going on?  Of course it is.  But what parent, first of all, gives permission to have their slutty daughter on HBO?  And think it's a good thing. 
[00:16:30]  This girl has to go back to school.  And let me tell you something.  She's going to be quite popular.  So we got the clips and they're great.  They're great.  They're great.  Oh, sorry, O.B.  3.15.  15 minutes after 3 o'clock.  And the real world.  MTV's real world premiere.  Chicago is great.  It is a carbon copy of every other one.  All the lesbian.  All the gay guy. 
[00:17:00]  All the black guy that's effing everything that has a pulse sometimes.  The black guy walked into the house, takes his clothes off right away.  They're all in the hot tub.  That's what Tech did, though.  Yeah, exactly.  Tech did the same thing.  And who's the fine African princess that's walking around nude?  Completely naked the whole time.  She got some junk in the trunk.  Junk in the trunk.  But she likes walking around naked.  She's very comfortable with her nudity.  One of the guys.  She was brought up that way.  And she walks around the house naked. 
[00:17:30]  Right off the bat.  One of the guys walks in on her and goes, oh, sorry, sorry.  She goes, oh, I don't care.  Walk in.  I'm not uncomfortable about nudity.  Isn't she showering with the guys already?  She's a lesbian, right?  Yeah.  And there's the guy, the black guy taking a shower.  She just strolls in, takes her clothes off, goes into the shower with him and starts lathering up.  What?  What is she thinking?  If I was in that shower in that situation, I was that guy right against the wall and you're plowing her.  What the hell? 
[00:18:00]  Court is going to say anything.  I'm taking a shower.  She runs in.  Naked.  It sounds to me like she wanted to try out a little of the old Louisiana black snake.  That's that phony, I'm so progressive.  Exactly.  Comfortable with my body.  Look, I'm comfortable and I could shower with a man.  Yeah.  But it doesn't mean it's going to go anywhere because I'm above that.  Aren't we beyond that?  Well, you know something?  The little head is doing the thinking in that situation and that definitely ain't beyond that. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, can I cut you off?  No.  I know you hate that, but we can talk about the real world after the break a little more and we can talk about the middle school confessions.  But we got a surprise guest that wants to come in and say hi.  Who?  I didn't know he was coming in today.  Yeah.  Rudy.  Oh, cool.  From the first Survivor.  Navy SEAL.  Navy SEAL.  Come on.  You didn't see Survivor, the first one?  No.  None of it.  No.  Oh, great.  The first one was mint.  That was the only one I watched.  They only have a few minutes.  Oh, this guy is like kick-ass. 
[00:19:00]  This guy is kick-ass.  He's got a new show.  Oh.  Yeah, you'll recognize him.  This is the guy I wanted to.  No, that ain't him.  That looks like someone Rudy shot.  That looks like someone that'll kill us.  Hey, what's up, man?  Rudy!  Rudy!  God damn, look at you.  Look at him.  Who's out there doing all that talking?  With his little flat top.  All of us, Rudy.  Yeah, a little bit of everything.  I was rooting for him.  I remember this one.  Yeah, because he's military.  Yes.  I was rooting for me, too.  I bet you were. 
[00:19:30]  You got the pudgy gay guy.  Beat you out.  Hey, what happened?  Shut my mic off.  Someone's turning off microphones here.  You got the pudgy gay guy.  Beat you out.  Everyone knows that story.  I was so disappointed when you let go of that thing.  Me, too.  When you just kind of, you went to change positions, and I guess you didn't realize it's something.  Well, before that, I was starting to doze off.  Were you?  Yeah.  He was nodding off.  Well, talking to Rich, I'm sure I'll get you anyone a little tired. 
[00:20:00]  No, he got off.  He did the smart thing.  You know, he knew he couldn't beat me.  He was hated.  Yeah.  I was light.  Right.  The best moment from the first Survivor was when Rudy was running through the woods with the camcorder and his questions.  Yeah.  And he didn't know any of the answers.  That is some fun, funny stuff.  Rudy knows how to kick ass.  Rudy knows how to kill us.  Because I knew who was getting eliminated that night.  It didn't matter.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, we had an alliance going.  That's right.  Yeah, the alliance.  The first alliance. 
[00:20:30]  At least I knew how to run the camera.  Yeah.  Taking my picture.  So now you guys, you got another show now.  This sounds pretty cool.  What is it called?  Combat?  Combat missions.  Combat missions.  And it's on at 10 o'clock tonight.  Yeah.  Now you got a bunch of guys.  Yeah.  This is one of the contestants.  Oh, you're a contestant?  Yeah.  Look at them.  How you doing, man?  Good.  How you doing?  I'm not a contestant.  I'm the base commander.  Yeah.  There's 24 contestants and they break them up into four squads of six. 
[00:21:00]  And they compete against each other like military missions.  Right.  Go out and rescue a downed pilot behind enemy lines.  Kind of wire explosives to a bridge kind of thing.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  All that kind of stuff.  And these guys are from the Army Rangers.  Oh, really?  Delta, Marine Recon, SEALs, police SWAT teams.  So it's not open to just any schlub that wants to get on there.  Yeah.  You got to have some experience.  These guys are ex-military. 
[00:21:30]  We're military schlubs.  So what were you, what's your name, Ed?  Ed.  And what branch were you in?  I spent time in the United States Army, 21 and a half years.  And my specialty, I guess, was with a counter-terrorist force.  Really?  Yeah.  Did he kill anyone?  Not on a show.  Look at you.  What?  Did you kill anyone?  It's not the first question you ask.  Why not?  You get into it.  What conflicts were you involved in?  I was with the Iranian hostage rescue mission.  Yeah, that didn't go well. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I know.  Jimmy Carter.  There's not enough resources there.  The guy thinks he's going to save a bunch of hostages with a couple of helicopters in the desert.  That was back in the day where they didn't want to give too much resources to the military  because everyone got a little nervous.  Nowadays, you know how you take care of that situation?  Like we're doing now.  Daisy cutters.  Daisy cutters.  How much do you love the daisy cutter there?  This guy ought to be Secretary of Defense.  Let me tell you something, Rudy.  Let me tell you something, Rudy, man.  I am so behind the military. 
[00:22:30]  I love a strong, decisive response now.  So this country never has to deal with problems like years ago.  Yeah.  We have the power to take care of problems that might arise around the world.  And we've got to use it when something like this pops up.  Anyway, the contestants in this show.  Back to the show.  I understand, Rudy.  It's all about the show.  There you go.  The contestants in this show are special operations people,  the guys that are doing the action over there right now.  Yeah.  And that's guys so you can sleep good at night. 
[00:23:00]  Exactly.  They're out there 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  I want to know a little more about Ed over here, though.  I want to know if he killed anyone.  Well, did you?  Did he strangle anyone?  Well, I have to kill you if I tell you that.  Yeah, right?  Look at Ed.  He looks pretty scary.  What were you, Delta Force?  That's what they called it.  Yeah?  The counter-terrorist force, yeah.  You think you could take everyone out in this room if you had to?  Oh, stop it.  Of course you could.  Don't be silly.  Which one goes first?  What are you going to do?  Who would go first? 
[00:23:30]  He ain't going at all.  Take him as a hostage.  I need him on the trail.  I'm bargaining chip.  Well, so you're involved in the Iranian situation and then probably Gulf War?  Actually, I retired.  Oh, you did?  Well, I was getting ready to retire, but I did what we call Just Because in Grenada.  Oh, Grenada?  Well, Grenada was...  Oh, with Clint Eastwood. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, no.  We didn't do the movie part.  No, not that part.  Oh, Panama was Just Because.  Actually, it was called Just Cause, but we called it Just Because.  Just Because.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  You were involved in the Panamanian thing, too?  Yeah, and then we did WWG, which is Grenada.  We call that.  WWG?  We have nicknames for everything.  Boy, pretty secretive, that whole Grenada thing.  Well, you guys must have been the first guys in to do a little recon work, huh?  Not actually.  No?  Well, we're part of a bigger element, but we don't like to talk about some of the things 
[00:24:30]  that we did there.  Yeah.  And...  Killing people.  Yeah.  Killing women and children?  I doubt that.  And, Rudy, what's your background now?  If women and children get in the way, they die.  Good for you.  Yes!  God damn it, I like that.  Everything's done at night.  You don't know who you kill.  Yeah, exactly.  They don't know if they killed me.  Rudy, what conflicts were you involved in?  Mainly Vietnam.  Vietnam.  Yeah.  You did a couple of tours over there? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And what years?  68 and 70.  Oh, the hot years.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Boy, that's tough.  Why'd you go back?  Because they said go back.  They did?  I was on a Navy bobsled team at the time, and...  Oh, boy.  It says, get a relief, you're leaving.  Really?  So, where were you?  Some of the places.  Lake Plast...  Oh.  No, but I don't remember any of the Lake Placid battles.  I thought you meant the bobsled team. 
[00:25:30]  You're like Rudy, man.  So, you see a lot of action back then?  As much as I wanted to see.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got any ears took back with you?  No.  No?  No.  I hear about the ears, Opie.  The necklace?  Yeah.  The ear necklace?  None of that.  No.  No.  No.  That's rare.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Apocalypse now, you know.  That's all I know.  These darn kids today.  You know, them guys went about 10,000 miles on one load of fuel in that little boat.  Never took on fuel. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, see, look at that.  He's got a point.  I like that.  Rudy, what do you think about what we're doing about terrorism and Afghanistan and the Taliban  and then this John Walker guy?  I agree with everything they're doing over there.  They should have killed Walker because all he's going to be is a problem.  Right.  Absolutely.  If they put him in jail, I'm going to help pay $74,000 a year to keep him in jail.  He gets sick, you're going to be taking care of his medication. 
[00:26:30]  So are you.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, believe me, I know that.  I'd rather they just put a bullet in his head and treat him like a traitor because that's  what he is.  And you see that head of hair, it's full of lice.  Oh, gee.  So you're saying they should have shampooed him a little bit more.  They should have shaved him, for sure.  Yeah.  You know what's going to happen?  He's going to get tied up in this ridiculous legal system with the lawyers over here.  He'll get out in time.  He's a young guy.  And he'll do the talk shows.  He'll do movie deals.  He'll end up getting a piece of what this country is all about, something he tried to destroy. 
[00:27:00]  I don't think he wants to walk down the street here.  Well, I agree with you.  I hope somebody in prison takes him out.  That would be nice.  I just read where they shaved a lot of these guys in Guantanamo.  Yeah.  Kind of fleas, you know.  Well, the human rights people now are saying that they're infringing on their religious beliefs  by shaving them.  They ought to put them in a cell with them.  Exactly.  Hallelujah.  And they say that they shouldn't put him in bare wire walled cages because it's inhumane. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Meanwhile, hey, we'd like to keep an eye on what these guys are doing or planning or thinking  because it's not like they haven't tried and succeeded in grabbing weapons and taking  over the last place they were camped out.  Well, they got the right guys watching them.  Oh, yeah.  Hardcore.  They ain't afraid to shoot.  Probably Marines have been down there for three years and they're dying to get home.  If they kill somebody, they'll go home.  Right.  Jail, but they'll go home.  That's great. 
[00:28:00]  So when's the show on?  Tonight at 10 o'clock.  Tonight at 10.  This sounds pretty cool.  USA Network.  Don't forget that.  USA Network.  USA.  Great.  And it's on for 14 weeks.  14 weeks?  And then what?  You got like a winning team?  One guy wins.  One guy?  Yeah.  The last six guys each get $25,000 and then the last guy gets $250,000.  Wow.  Wow.  Look at that.  A couple people want to say hi to Rudy Ant.  Joe, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yeah, I can just picture Rudy hanging out the back of a helicopter going, 
[00:28:30]  Easy!  You just don't lead him so much!  Yeah, that's a great line.  How do you shoot women and children?  Easy, you just don't lead him as much.  If they run, they're VC.  VC, if they stand still, they're well-disciplined, VC.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I just want to say hi to Rudy and let him know he rules he should have won and beat that  gay guy.  But as far as Walker goes, there's no way they'll even put him in a prison environment 
[00:29:00]  where there's Americans, because he'll never make it.  Well, we can only hope.  We can only hope.  I would personally do them in myself.  And, you know, you guys are hard to get through, too.  I've been trying to call you since Dice played the Garden, because I was the poor, unfortunate  guy that walked up to the front that they were calling Harley, dude.  Well, dude, just call the Washington number.  You'll get right through.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe I should try Chicago, eh?  There you go.  All right, Bill.  Thank you. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Rudy, you rule.  Later.  Thanks.  A couple of people want to say hi real fast.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Let me tell you something.  Rudy's an American hero.  A true, a really American hero, yet because he fell asleep and couldn't stand on, hold  on to a pole.  Some fat, overweight gay guy gets a million dollars.  Rudy should have shanked him at the end of the show.  It's the money.  It's old news now.  Rudy's doing fine.  He is doing fine.  You're probably one of the guys with the most exposure and making the most out of your  time on Survivor.  Ask him how you shank a gay guy. 
[00:30:00]  You don't lead him so much.  You know something?  I don't even want to know how you shank a gay guy.  Not with a meat shank.  You don't use the meat shank on him.  Hey, Rudy, you talk to the old gang or what?  Anybody from the show?  Yeah, I seen him the other night, the gay guy.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Well, you guys ended up kind of being friendly, right?  He was rubbing.  No, no, no, no.  You were rubbing lotion on him and stuff?  Rubbing lotion on him.  That's right.  They caught me doing that before I found out. 
[00:30:30]  And then decided to run it after you.  I had to go home and apologize to the Atlantic fleet over there.  I'm sure there's still pictures of that hanging up on some of the ships.  So how did you see him the other night?  Don't tell me you're dancing at a club or nothing.  The last night of Survivor, he was there.  Oh, the last one that was just on.  What did you say to him?  Hi, Rich.  When we parted, I told him Rich. 
[00:31:00]  It was nice knowing you.  I shook his hand.  Don't ever call me and I won't call you.  And that's the way we parted.  Goddamn, you're old school.  I like that.  Well, I can't afford to have a guy like that calling me up.  You are absolutely right.  My God, Rudy.  You tell it like it is, Rudy.  That's for sure.  We like that on this show.  Cool, man.  So tonight, USA.  We'll check it out.  Let Ed tell you about some of the episodes on the show.  All right. 
[00:31:30]  Ed?  Ed is well-trained, by the way.  He's eyeballing all of us.  You notice that?  He's getting his room left and right, left and right, left and right.  Completely aware of his environment at all times, right?  What are some of the things you've got to do on this show?  Well, tonight you'll see me on the first episode.  I'll be there.  I'm on Charlie's squad and we're going to be doing a, they call it tank takeout.  It's the mission.  What does that entail now?  What do you got to do?  That entails my squad to go out there, find this tank, and then take it out. 
[00:32:00]  In the meantime, while we're trying to take out this tank with this 20-pound explosives,  you'll have a shadow squad, a bunch of people who are dressed in different uniforms, but  they're out to try to shoot us and kill us.  And how they kill us is that we are actually using these laser-type weapons, no bullets,  just blanks, but they shoot lasers out, and we're all wearing vests that have sensors on  there so that if they get a laser hits you, you're considered dead.  Wow, that sounds cool. 
[00:32:30]  Now, if you watch the show tonight, there's something you have to, I want to kind of explain  to people.  When you see the show tonight, you'll see us moving, and you don't see us moving very  fast, because we're each wearing about 80 pounds of gear.  Yeah.  We're required to wear this 50-pound pack and about 30 pounds of helmet cam.  Oh, you've all got cameras on and everything.  Oh, yeah, and we're totally loaded down, so when you see us moving, compared to what you  see the shadow squad moving, you're going to go, oh, my God, those guys are like, they 
[00:33:00]  don't know how to move fast.  Shadow squad's like ninja guys or something?  Well, they're not wearing any equipment.  Ah, just have the weapons.  Yeah, I have the weapons and the little vests that, you know, they're only carrying me  10 pounds of gear, where we're carrying about 80 pounds plus, plus the actual satchel charge  we use, even though it's a dummy charge, it weighed 20 pounds, so we've got that, it's  carrying about 100 pounds of load.  You guys get weapons, you get to shoot back at them, or you've got to get in and get out?  No, we all have the same weapons, so we all have equal chances of, you know, eliminating  each other from the show.  That sounds wild. 
[00:33:30]  You've got to check this out.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  I'm not making this up.  A lot of people are instant feedback, Anthony.  Yeah.  Paulie Lawrence writes, Rudy has to say queer.  That's priceless.  What?  That's priceless S, he writes.  What the hell?  I don't remember him ever saying that.  Did he say that on the show?  Yeah, he did.  Oh, you called him that on the show, did you?  My queer buddy, Richard.  Well, you know.  Hey, you know, two of them young girls were sitting around the fire one night, and they 
[00:34:00]  asked him, how come he called you a queer?  Oh, really?  And he says, well, when he was born, that's what we were.  And I walked up, and I says, and he still is.  There you go.  I mean, they never heard the word queer.  No, no.  It's not widely used today.  I think queer is more old school, right, Ed?  Queer, yeah.  A little more old school.  Well, you know, in even older school, queer was just something that was a little off. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  It's a little queer.  Yeah.  Right?  A little cockeyed.  Well, cockeyed means something else today, too.  Something I think Richard might enjoy.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  This is Calvin.  I'm originally from Boston.  I just want to say hi to Rudy.  You know, Rudy, I love you, man.  You know, you got to stand up for what you believe in and all that.  You say what you mean.  And O&A, y'all the best.  I just want to keep it brief, and that's it.  You know what I'm saying?  Norton, you rule.  Thank you, sir.  Norton, I think, is scared of Rudy. 
[00:35:00]  He hasn't said a word.  I love Rudy, man.  I love military guys.  They're just great.  It is something in this day and age to have somebody that speaks their mind and, you know,  you're not into the political correctness and stuff like that.  And, you know, whether you agree with the guy or not, he does.  He speaks his mind.  That's a great thing.  Tell it like it is.  Yeah.  Why not?  All right.  Very cool.  We'll all check out the show tonight.  Okay.  Sounds good.  Very good.  Guys, thanks a lot, man.  We're going to see you in the show.  Combat Mission.  Combat Mission.  It's 10 o'clock tonight on USA.  You got it. 
[00:35:30]  Great.  There he goes.  Rudy!  Yeah.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  We have a version standing by that wants in on our latest little idea.  This will be our fourth attempt.  Stay tuned.  The Naughty Nighty Contest starts next week on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Stay tuned for details.  And he's double-cut.  Yeah, we're back with the O&A Show.  It's Whip-A-Val Wednesday.  Yeah.  You don't have to do it.  We're not forcing anyone. 
[00:36:00]  There's plenty of ladies that will do it.  Sure.  That's what wow means in your city.  Okay?  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Buffalo, New York, Anthony.  Buffalo, New York.  Ah, Buffalo.  Ratings very, very, very, very good in Buffalo.  Thank you, guys.  866-277-4.  Wow.  A bunch of people want to talk about the real world.  We're going to talk about middle school confessions.  Middle school confessions.  We have audio clips that you're not going to believe. 
[00:36:30]  But I think we've got to go right to Keisha before she hangs up on us here.  All right.  The virgin thing continues, Anthony.  Yes.  So far, we've had three girls come to the table saying they would lose their virginity  on our show.  And so far, we're 0 for 3, right?  Mm-hmm.  I think we still have a shot with Nicole, the 19-year-old Puerto Rican virgin.  We might, but we have to wait because she's having her little friend.  After that passes, then we'll revisit her virginity.  I knew this was going to be like fishing, you know? 
[00:37:00]  Got to be patient.  Got to wait and see.  So hopefully Keisha can help us out here.  Let's go to Keisha.  Keisha, 21 years old.  Keisha.  Yes.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Philadelphia.  Philadelphia.  LA.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you an African princess?  Yes, I am.  And you're a virgin.  Yes.  How dark?  Cafe Latte dark?  No, I'm about a caramel brown.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Caramel brown.  All right.  I love it. 
[00:37:30]  Mm-hmm.  Ah!  That's nice.  That is real nice.  Do you got, uh...  Well, my aunt's got ass because it's his thing.  What?  The, uh...  You got a junk in the trunk?  You know I do.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, that's what my sister's got a junk in the trunk.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  I got...  I like that.  You leave me.  I like that.  I like that.  I like that.  All right.  21 years old.  Uh, how tall are you, Keisha? 
[00:38:00]  I'm 5'7 and a half.  5'7 and a half?  Girl ain't got no booty to grab onto.  I want no part of that.  Mm-hmm.  I need...  I need some ass on a girl.  Mm-hmm.  I got stability.  Yeah.  So what else?  How pathetic are we, Keisha, trying to talk black?  Oh, we're so awful.  Well, y'all can talk it.  It's just a little bit ebionics.  I can't talk for Anthony, but I want to be black so bad, man.  You do.  You guys got it going.  Oh, I'm a little bit.  So, all right.  You're 5'7 and a half.  I'll start you off on the right road. 
[00:38:30]  5'7 and a half.  How much do you weigh?  I weigh 138.  138.  Oh, hold on.  Get your chart.  You need a different chart, though.  Oh, the black chart?  Yeah.  Oh, we got a...  It's different.  We got a compensating.  For the boot hair.  Oh, yeah.  5'7 and a half, 138.  No problem.  Yeah.  Right in the middle of the chart there.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Now, why have you decided to remain a virgin up until 21?  Because I didn't find someone who I thought I should give my precious blushes to. 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  But I figured since it's a contest on the radio station that I love to listen to, why not go for it?  Yeah.  I'll tell you why.  Because you live in a white neighborhood.  But...  You have many boyfriends?  No.  No?  Uh-uh.  How many?  All right.  Is there something wrong with you?  No, there's nothing wrong with me.  You ain't got one leg or nothing.  Uh-uh.  I got both my legs.  Both my legs.  You got the big boobies? 
[00:39:30]  The small boobies?  Yeah, I'm a D-cut.  A D-cut?  Yeah.  Like, what's the number before the D?  36.  That's nice.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  40 D, a little scary.  Mm-hmm.  Anything over 38, a little scary.  36 D, nice.  You don't want a girl's back to look like Mike Tyson at weigh-in.  You know what I mean?  That big, broad back.  Looks like a cobra ready to strike.  So, Keisha, how would you like to lose your virginity?  Well, I always fantasize about being on the island with black sand, but since you're 
[00:40:00]  saying New York, I wouldn't mind being on top of the Empire State Building.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Holy ass.  Do we know anyone at the Empire State Building?  No.  You want to lose your virginity at the top of the Empire State Building?  At the top.  How are we going to make this happen?  Yeah, we know someone there.  Who do you know?  Yeah, we can work it out.  You can work it out?  Wait, write it down.  We really have a connection there?  Yeah.  Hold on there, Keisha.  Okay.  Yeah.  And you got a man's?  Holy ass. 
[00:40:30]  No, I got a man's.  You ain't got no man's?  Uh-uh.  I'm trying to find me a man's.  Are we going to have to find you a man's?  Would you be into a firefighter?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  I'm getting really turned on.  Keisha, it sounds hot.  You sound hot?  I sound hot.  I am hot, baby.  What color are your eyes?  Brown.  Well, sometimes, you know, there's a little thing that goes on and they turn green.  They turn green.  A little green or that hazel color.  Uh-uh.  They turn green.  Something tells me that was the plantation owner way back when had the blue eyes.  No, that happens. 
[00:41:00]  Sometimes you get the mulatto girls.  They got the blue eyes.  Uh-uh.  And I'm just a black girl with brown eyes.  And what kind of hair you got?  I got, I cut it short right now.  Uh-uh.  Because is it nappy?  Oh, no.  I don't got nappy eyes.  You ain't got no weave, do you?  Oh, I get the weave.  I get the weave.  Don't work on the weave.  I put that weave right off your hair.  You pull it off, baby.  Pull it off.  I'm kidding.  I bet you look good.  I do.  Mm-hmm.  I like the soft curls on my black ladies.  You like what?  I like the soft curls.  Oh, you like the soft curls? 
[00:41:30]  I don't want hair that looks like Kizzy Kente.  Oh, uh-huh.  Remember Kizzy?  It's coldness.  No, Kizzy was the girl.  Kizzy was the girl, yeah.  Oh, all right.  Don't you know your roots?  She spit in the drink.  Yeah.  I don't like when you ladies, like, plaster it down and it looks kind of plastic and stuff.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  I don't know what you put in it, but it just, like, it looks plastered down.  It looks all slick and plastered down like plastic.  Doesn't move in the wind.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, no.  I ain't got to say my hair flow, baby.  It flow.  Even though it's short, it still flow.  Yeah? 
[00:42:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What kind of hairstyle are you sporting elsewhere, baby?  What kind of hairstyle am I sporting right now?  Yeah, elsewhere.  You know what I'm talking about?  Oh, no.  I don't know what you're talking about.  You don't do any of that shaving elsewhere, baby?  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I like the shave.  I keep that close.  Ooh, you keep that nice and close.  Mm-hmm.  Keep that close.  Mm-hmm.  I like that.  You like that?  Smooth as a Hershey kiss.  Mm-hmm.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  I hear that. 
[00:42:30]  What did we learn yesterday?  I hear that.  The black of the berry?  The sweet of the juice.  The sweet of the juice.  I got some cheddar.  You got some cheddar?  Cheddar.  I gots the cheddar.  Hi.  Hi, Keisha.  I'll supply you with the cheddar.  I'm your cheddar man.  Well, as long as you got it, I want it.  She knows what the cheddar is.  Yeah.  I got some cheddar. 
[00:43:00]  You do?  Lots of it.  I can pay to rent.  Oh, okay.  I got mortgage.  Yeah.  You got any chidens?  Oh, you're a virgin.  I'm having a chidens with a virgin.  We're just amazed that you're a virgin, don't we?  Yeah, well, why?  Because I'm 21?  No, not because you're 21.  Have you done other things, baby?  You do other things with guys or anything, baby?  No, all I did was kiss and hug.  I'm scared to go to third base.  Just kissing and hugging.  You're afraid to go to third base? 
[00:43:30]  I'll try it for you guys.  You never put your hand anywhere?  Oh, yeah.  I touched it.  Oh, you've done that?  Yeah.  What'd you think?  I'm like, whoa.  Was it a brother?  You know it.  Yeah.  I want to find me a white man.  You want to find you a white man?  I want to find me one.  You'll try you one?  Yeah.  A little cream in your coffee, baby?  Yeah.  Well, if we line up the gang from the FDNY, you'll find there are lots of white guys.  Oh, yeah.  How white?  What do you mean, how white? 
[00:44:00]  Wonder Bread white.  I mean, I want them to have a little bit of a tin.  A little bit of a tin.  Yeah, a little bit of a tin.  Oh, you Irish guys are out.  You're out.  Poor Irish guys sitting at the firehouse under the light drinking their beer.  You're out.  Out.  You need a what?  Like an Italian guy?  Yeah.  Something like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, so we're looking for an Italian fireman in New York City.  Maybe a Greek guy?  Yeah, something like that.  Something like that.  You know, with a nice dark hair.  Yeah.  I can run my finger through it. 
[00:44:30]  Could someone talk to you-know-who to see how possible this is?  You think it's possible?  I think we can explain it.  We think we might have a connection at the Empire State Building.  Are you serious?  I'm serious.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  That's what I'm talking about.  Make this thing happen.  What would you...  Six floors up, baby.  What would your second choice be?  My second choice?  Under a bridge somewhere in Brooklyn?  Oh, you want me to take it down to Brooklyn?  No, that's too ghetto.  Oh, you don't need that.  Uh-uh.  What would your second choice be, though?  Um...  East New York, so a bunch of the other guys could join in. 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  I couldn't choose that, man.  That's mad.  Look at Lou on line three.  Blowing up my spot.  Lou.  Yeah.  What's up?  Well, I mean, Anthony does all right, but you are so painful.  You're painfully white.  There's no...  This is no joke.  I used to go to black clubs in Buffalo when I was doing radio up there because I was trying  to...  I was trying to bang a black chick.  And I would go into these places with some of my pals, and I would just get laughed at  all night long, man. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, I understand.  I feel bad for you.  Anthony's doing all right.  38 with a little junk?  That's nice.  A little bit of junk.  Always nice.  You're nice and tight, though, right?  Yeah.  Keep it firm.  Everything's all tight back there.  Keep it firm.  Yeah.  It's like an upside-down question mark.  Yes, you got it.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right, gentlemen.  Thanks a lot.  All right, man.  Talk to you later.  Oh, no.  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, I got a question for this African princess.  All right.  See, I'm a fighter in Staten Island, and I believe this chick's got her own fire hose. 
[00:46:00]  I got my own fire hose?  Yeah, you're a man.  She's not.  A man?  It's a guy.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Keisha.  Wow, that's a good job, Keisha.  Huh?  Are you a guy?  That's a good job.  No, I'm not no guy.  I mean, why would I be calling up here acting like a woman if I was a guy?  I think you're a phony.  Oh, no.  Are you a freak?  No, I ain't a freak.  Are you a freak?  It's a frenzy. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no.  Keisha.  Take him off the air.  Find me somebody named Greg that's hand-on.  What's up?  My name's Greg.  Oh, your name's Greg.  Greg.  This is the Greg and Anthony show.  How are you?  You ain't no mans, are you?  I ain't no mans, but if you packing, then they can make me holla.  Holla.  Yeah.  How do you spell holla?  H-O-L-L-A, right?  That's right.  Holla.  Holla.  Yeah.  Man, you sound too good to be true.  I want my first experience to be the bomb, you know what I mean? 
[00:47:00]  I'll make you holla.  I'll smack your face and steal your purse.  You ain't what they steal my purse.  You be hollering, let me tell you.  You be hollering.  Get the police.  He call you daddy.  Call me daddy.  Yeah.  Show.  Yeah.  What if we take...  Is it going to be like air tape or something on TV or...  No, no, no.  We don't have to do anything like that.  Is it on the radio?  We'll do as much as you want to do.  Okay.  You know, maybe the lead up and then, you know, maybe then we, like, the post-interview. 
[00:47:30]  I'm about it, about it, but I'm saying, am I going to see this man again?  You like, you like...  You like the morning show here?  I listen to it at work sometimes.  Yeah?  You call him up?  Well, this is my first time calling.  Yeah?  What, do you really think this is a guy?  They're all pink on the inside.  Yeah, they are.  This is from Philly.  Yeah, I'm from Philly.  You ain't no mans.  I ain't no mans.  Because if you're the mans, the joke is out of the...  The cat's out of the bag, baby.  I ain't no mans. 
[00:48:00]  The jig's up, no pun.  We kind of know.  So...  Oh, no.  You're a guy?  No!  You ain't macking us, are you?  No.  Who is that who keeps saying that?  She's going to have to come up here, then.  You like that, right?  Where I got to go to?  Can you come up here tomorrow or Friday?  Where am I coming to?  New York City.  Friday.  You're a dick, Norton.  If you're a man, that's whack.  I ain't no man.  You paying for my trip to New York City?  No, if you's a man, baby, that's whack. 
[00:48:30]  You going to pay for my trip?  Hell yeah, New York City.  New York City?  Yeah, get your ass on a train.  We'll pay it.  We'll pay it.  Are you fully functional?  I'm fully, yeah.  Yeah.  What's up?  About it, about it.  You ain't got no junk in the front, do you?  We like the junk in the trunk.  We don't like the junk in the front.  My front is full-ed.  I got it.  What's up, Adam?  How you doing?  All right.  Well, what's your second choice if we can't do the Empire State Building thing?  If we can't do the Empire State Building, if I can't do the Empire State Building, do 
[00:49:00]  y'all have an End of the Dove out there?  A what?  An End of the Dove hotel.  A hotel?  Yeah.  You ain't got no Empire State Building in your pants, do you?  No.  Yeah.  What is that hotel?  It's called the End of the Dove.  Is it one of those cheap hourly joints?  Cheap hourly?  Oh, come on.  I don't know what it is.  I mean, well, it's like...  Holy ass.  Everyone is saying you're a man now.  Oh, they just hate us. 
[00:49:30]  They hate us.  Why are y'all having the contents of your personal life?  Be a player, participator.  You're a man.  Mm-hmm.  And what are you?  I'm a woman, honey.  Oh, I don't think so, boo.  Oh, please.  Okay.  You call every station, you pretend you're a woman, and you come out with that deep voice  going, I'm a man.  Oh, please.  Everyone knows who you are.  100% woman.  More women than you.  I just don't mean.  Take a look.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Idiot.  I kind of remember that one guy that called up as a girl, a black girl. 
[00:50:00]  No, no, this one is, because not only with Scott, but on Don and Mike, too.  And they had, she had him on for like an hour.  We've heard that guy.  He's been on our show also.  And though Keisha does not sound like that guy, I'm not saying 100% that Keisha ain't on  me.  You know, because some guys are pretty good at that.  Keisha.  No, she, this morning, too, with Scott.  What's up?  Call my home phone number and check my voicemail.  Oh, and.  100% woman.  They'll say hi.  She didn't call, she didn't call the morning show? 
[00:50:30]  She didn't call the sports guys this morning?  No.  This is my first time calling.  Like, who are you?  But then she let it slip.  I listen to you guys all the time.  So, now she doesn't know who she's talking about, right?  Find your business and hang up the phone.  Like, I don't need you.  You're not calling to lose your virginity.  Yeah, that's why you're a virgin.  I'm sorry, baby.  You know what I'm saying?  I can be a virgin.  I'm proud to be a virgin.  Well, then don't call the show if you're going to be an idiot.  Hey, Caroline.  What?  Maybe you're not.  You don't know.  She's just trying to defend us.  I understand. 
[00:51:00]  If Keisha's aren't talking manly, we're going to look really stupid.  No, because we know.  That's just it.  If she does, then it's not really a joke.  Because we kind of know already.  And if she is a guy, you don't have facial hair, do you?  No.  Well, then it's not gay if I got a run.  All right, Keisha, what are we going to do?  That's what I'm saying.  What's up?  What?  Y'all going to bring me out to New York or what?  What is Ben saying?  Huh?  We'll bring you out.  I guess we got to just bring her here to see for ourselves.  We'll bring you out. 
[00:51:30]  You want to come tomorrow?  I said Friday.  I got to work, boo.  Friday?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you just call me boo?  What's she doing?  What's she doing for a living?  I'm a data entry clerk at University of Pennsylvania.  Yeah, you entered that data.  All right.  Well, you know, we could give her a chance.  People are kind of raining on our parade.  We think we might have found something nice here, finally.  Yeah, you know, we can't really be.  Let me tell you.  Keisha, if you're a man, you did your job, and now you've got to tell us. 
[00:52:00]  I'm not.  Because then everyone will really laugh, and then N.I. will be called fags for the next  three hours.  Why would I be a man?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, because sometimes guys call up, and they act like girls, because it's kind of funny.  It's a joke.  They play on us.  Oh, so I guess that y'all really don't want nobody to enter this concept.  I mean, I don't have to lie about being a female.  No, of course not.  Well, Stinky already checked her voicemail, and he says it's her.  It's a girl.  All right, Keisha.  All right, baby.  Uh-huh.  I'm going with that you're a virgin and you're a woman.  Yeah.  You're a man.  And you're going to come up here Friday, right? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  So we can check you out.  Yeah.  And possibly do the deed, right?  Yeah, possibly.  Okay.  If we find that nice man.  We'll find a nice man for you.  We'll have the fire departments on standby.  All right.  Fire departments on standby for Friday.  All right.  All right?  Okay.  The fine African princess from Philly.  That's me.  36D, 137, 57 1⁄2.  38, boo.  38 what?  Oh, 138?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Okay.  Stop calling me boo. 
[00:53:00]  I hate that.  I'm sorry.  All right.  She's sorry.  She's sorry.  I love your show, Jerry.  The phones are going nuts.  There you go.  This girl is legit.  The guys are freaking...  We'll see yours.  We'll check it out.  We'll have to check it out.  That's all we can do.  We can't make a decision over the phone unless, you know, if it's a he actually went, hey,  guys, I screwed with you.  Right.  Up until then, we've got to play it off like it's a girl.  And then when she comes in here, we'll make our whatever. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  Adam Farrar.  Hey there, pal.  Hiya, champ.  How you doing there, Chief?  I'm good.  Good.  We'll talk to you next, all right?  The job starts up again tonight, Anthony.

I've been watching that show.  Adam, did you watch Middle School Confessions on HBO?  No.  Oh, stick around for the clip.  Great stuff.  Really? 
[00:54:00]  And also, The Real World premiered last night.  We got some comments about that.  Yeah.  We got to talk to Scott Farrell, our new morning guy here in New York.  I guess he got kicked out of his hotel room.  Kicked out of his hotel.  He has no clothes.  I saw him on the streets of New York this morning.  Yeah.  And he looked like hell.  So we got to check in with him to see if he's doing okay or not, okay?  And also, the Naughty Nighty contest starts up next weekend.  Naughty Nighty.  Details on the way.  How old are you?  18.

The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Look who's joining us today.  I know.  Hey, it's really fast, though.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, and Brittany's having a problem in Cleveland, so we want to  go to her real fast, okay? 
[00:56:00]  Brittany, what's the problem today?  There's no WOW stickers in Cleveland.  Oh, gosh.  And that just leaves me, like, heartbroken, because I have to wear shirts all the time.  You what?  It sucks.  I always have to wear a shirt.  And you want to flash somebody.  You know how fun it is?  I'm by a truck right now, actually.  Well, you know something?  No, don't WOW unless you see a WOW, because...  Then it's not special.  Yeah, we've got to get them out there.  It looks like the show's catching on in Cleveland. 
[00:56:30]  You would think there'd be some WOW stickers and some homemade WOW signs around for Brittany  so she could flash her lovely boobs.  How big are they, Brittany?  They're a double D.  And how old are you?  18.  Wow.  La-de-la!  Wow.  You weren't on Middle School Confessions, were you?  No.  Oh, my gosh.  No.  As soon as we get the audio from Middle School Confessions, we're going right with it on the show.  We're stalling because Rick's still putting it together.  So, Brittany, 18 double Ds, you don't see the WOW on the cars, and so you're going to, you know, 
[00:57:00]  you're not going to flash.  Yeah.  Well, I was just, like...  How many guys are screaming right now?  Because I thought your guys' ratings in Cleveland were supposed to be, like, really good.  They are really good.  And the thing is, the next phase is the WOW.  You guys...  See, you have helped us out with the ratings.  Now we help you out with the luscious cans.  All you've got to do, put a WOW on your vehicle somewhere.  The girls are out there, just like Brittany, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's girls.  I love fun people.  I'm kidding. 
[00:57:30]  I'm kidding.  You know what I wanted to talk to you guys about, actually?  What?  The other day I was listening to your show about...  Ain't it funny when they start to talk?  Oh, listen, like how guys only like their girlfriends for sex, and they only think about  having sex with their girlfriends or whatever?  Yeah!  And I don't know about Arnie and the other girls out there, but I know there's a lot of  my friends that I like to bone, and I don't have many friends that I wouldn't want to bone 
[00:58:00]  that are guys.  So you guys don't understand why there are girls calling up and you're like, oh my god,  they're such pigs!  So wait, you like to bone your friends?  Well, only if it's not going to interfere with the friendship, you know, but I mean, I've  done it with enough of my friends.  Oh yeah?  It doesn't affect the friendship?  Well yeah, no, it doesn't really.  I mean, it just means more sleepovers.  Her big hands.  You didn't have such nice, firm boobs. 
[00:58:30]  Two had hung up on you minutes ago.  That's a great little story.  All right, Brittany, keep driving, and hopefully you'll see a wow soon.  Guys, you're crazy.  You are absolutely crazy.  Just put the wow...  Who wouldn't put a wow in their car and say, ah, what the hell, I'll throw it on and see  what happens.  It's the little payback we give to you.  That's a thank you.  Isn't it?  You can have a friend like that.  I grew up with you.  I know.  We're thanking people with lovely breasts.  All right, Brittany.  That's better than concert tickets.  Brittany, let us know if you see a wow out there.  Call us back, okay? 
[00:59:00]  I will, I will.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  And if you do see a wow, call us back.  We'll do it live on the air for everybody, okay?  All right, thanks.  Bye.  Oh, Jim's back.  Just went out to get lunch.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, there you go.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hey, by the way, speaking of Cleveland, we have sent out a satellite.  Hey, what's happening?  We have sent a satellite to Cleveland.  A probe?  A little probe.  We like to, you know, send out probes to some of these cities.  Are you in Cleveland right now?  I'm in Cleveland right now, right this second.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Voss. 
[00:59:30]  I'm staying down at, I guess they call it the flats down here or whatever.  The flats rock.  Yeah, and let me tell you, there are some really hot girls in Cleveland.  Oh, yeah?  I've been here one day.  It's unbelievable.  These girls are unbelievable.  Voss, did you jump?  Huh?  Did you jump yet?  Yeah, but no one was in the room but me.  Did you jump?  Oh, my God.  No, no, I didn't.  What's happening, Adam?  Hey, how are you, Rich?  All right, and Norton.  What's up, buddy?  What's happening?  So you're not going to come hang with me this weekend at the Stress Factory Thursday through Saturday? 
[01:00:00]  No, not at all.  Are you going to be watching the show?  Definitely going to see that.  Hey, did anybody see the movie Vanilla Sky?  Uh, no.  No.  If you look at it, you see when Tom Cruise is wearing the mask in it?  Yeah.  He looks like Norton.  You have to see it, though, to make it funny.  I cannot be really funny today.  I'm sick.  Hey, will that be one of the jokes you're doing today at the Improv?  No, it's not one of the jokes I'll be doing today.  Listen.  That was new material.  Where are you going to be tonight, Bossy?  I'm going to be tonight through Sunday at the Improv, but I'm going to be handing out 
[01:00:30]  Wow stickers after the show.  I have a bunch of them here.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Did you go to the strip club across the street there?  No, we're going to go tonight.  Who's this, Adam?  No.  No.  No, I don't know who asked me about the strip club.  How would you guys know about it?  Does it matter?  Because the other comics went to it last night, but I didn't feel good.  I'm going to go tonight.  But there were some O&A people in there last night.  It was cool.  Bossy, are you going to be alive for your show tonight?  Oh, I'm really out of it right now.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I really am.  Were you sucking on a muffler before you called? 
[01:01:00]  No, I'm just, you know.  You got a pretzel stuck in your throat and your brain pressure?  No, I'm just, I don't know.  I'm just really out of it.  I'm upset about this statue thing and everything.  I can't be funny.  I can't be funny today.  I swear to God, I said.  Today?  Well, Rick said call in.  I go, I have not a funny bone in my body.  I can't do it.  So the only reason I'm doing this is to be a team player and hand out stickers.  So you'll be handing out wow stickers after your show tonight.  Look for a girl named Brittany. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  Oh, man.  God, this is really horrifying.  I wish I was in the studio so I could see your blank faces staring at me at least.  Dude, do the thing about how you owe your kids money.  That's funny.  Oh, please.  Don't you?  You're going to tell me what funny is?  Shut up.  All right?  I'm going to give you a lead in, Rich.  Knock, knock.  Who's that?  Who's there at the end of my career?  All right, look.  I've got to go back to bed.  I really, I really, I am going to go back to bed and really pray that I didn't make this call. 
[01:02:00]  Can you believe this is the guy that just killed on our show with Patrice a couple of days ago?  No, I kill every time I'm in the studio.  Usually we help out our pals and we know when you're not feeling it, we'll hang up on you and move on, but we're just enjoying this right now.  What's that?  We're enjoying this.  Eric from Philly, boss.  Eric from Philly says, saw the movie, still isn't funny.  Now that's funny.  No, you know, some days, you know, you know what you like, you don't want to go to work some days, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:02:30]  You know, just times other commas call and they're not funny.  I don't want to say any names, you know, I don't want to piss anybody off.  Who?  Go ahead.  Who?  Huh?  Go ahead, who?  I don't know offhand.  I can't do a Madden impression.  I don't know.  But you know what I'm saying?  Wow.  What?  Wow, look at you.  Wow.  Who are you talking about being outrageous?  What's that?  Yeah, I think I know who he's talking about.  A little jealousy maybe?  No, not at all.  I'm not jealous.  I'm very happy with where I am right now.  In a condo in the middle of nowhere with no car. 
[01:03:00]  I'm going to play the sound of you.  I'm very happy with my life.  But I'm just not funny today.  Oh, here we go.  Here's the silent thing now.  You know what?  I'll go on the morning check.  All right.  I'll make that show funny.  All right.  All right.  You can all play the same game.  I'm not going to let Voss at the Improv in Cleveland Thursday through Sunday.  Three shows Saturday to Friday.  I wonder if they hung up.  I stink.  Oh, man. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Here's the deal.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'm going to hang up and call right back.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I can hear a background.  They're giving me the silent treatment.  All of a sudden, I'm Norris now.  Jesus.  I can just get a bag of tricks.  Why did I call?  All right.  This is fun.  This is fun.  The guy who helps the show out all the time.  The team player.  This is what they're doing to me.  How many road shows does Rich Voss kill at?  You know, who gets thrown in a pool and knocked off a chair for the team? 
[01:04:00]  Rich Voss.  This is what I got to take this abuse.  All right.  Maybe we should get Tom Hanks' little kid in again.  24-year-old Brad.  My daddy doesn't know my career.  Yeah, sure.  Change your name to Thompson in the next audition.  Anyhow, I'm talking to myself.  I'm hanging up.  I swear to God.  I'm hanging up.  And then I'm calling back.  I'm hanging up.  Just babbling.  Was Voss babbling? 
[01:04:30]  I love that.  I can't be funny today.  He will kill tonight, dear problem, Cleveland.  Of course he will.  Don't let that affect your decision to go see Rich Voss tonight.  We sent out a probe.  He's in Cleveland for us.  Yeah.  For the next few days.  So go check out Rich Voss.  And get your WoW stickers in Cleveland, okay?  He's sending a WoW stickers out of himself.  Yeah.  It's a week-long sticker stuff.  But there's only one reason why he's handing out the WoW stickers.  To pick up a chick.  Get chicks. 
[01:05:00]  He wants chicks.  There's a strip club across the street.  Yeah.  And he didn't go.  You're not going to get laid in a strip club, though.  Yeah.  Voss thinks he will.  Believe me, he does.  He actually believes it.  I was in Vegas.  This is true.  I never do this.  I don't go to strip clubs.  I went to one.  This Russian chick with a fat dumper gave me 11 lap dances.  11?  No.  Believe me, I would have taken the hymn from her.  11.  Four times I had to stop.  I'm like, oh, that's not a dumper.  Oh, that close?  Where did I go?  That close.  Really?  Oh, that close. 
[01:05:30]  And I should have done it.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You don't want to wait a minute.  Why is that public?  I almost.  You were just going to dump.  Oh, without shame.  But I was with a guy, a buddy of mine.  Yeah.  And I didn't know if we were going to be there for a while.  And I'm like, eh, it's funny for 30 seconds, but it's not like any of my other friends are here to enjoy it.  I did that once in New Orleans.  I showed Pete Correale and Louis Ramey.  I'm like, look, guys.  And it looked like a homicide on the front of my boxers.  That's a good place, though.  Lap dance to the almost completion, right?  Dude.  Not almost.  It was by far the best I've ever gotten. 
[01:06:00]  Don't tell Adam which strip club.  We'll have it shut down.  It's all back from season one of The Junk.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  All back from season one of The Junk.  That's what I said.  Oh, when did the second season start?  Tonight.  At 9.30?  On ABC.  Oh, my God.  We love The Junk.  That much contact, though, on The Junk?  And she was good looking?  Oh, dude.  You need contact.  There was knee contact and then groin to groin hump.  Wow.  While I hugged her. 
[01:06:30]  I almost said, I love you.  I never get roped in like that.  Wow.  So you kind of had your hand on her lower back, ass area.  Oh, both cheeks.  They were just...  Oh, oh, oh.  Your hands.  And as you're like pulling, there's contact and unleishment.  Yeah.  No, I could have.  I really should have, but then I thought...  Hey, Keisha, the virgin from Philly, right?  21 years old.  Uh-huh.  She wants to come up Friday to prove that she is a girl and not a guy. 
[01:07:00]  Uh-huh.  Remember that whole thing?  Uh-huh.  And a lot of guys call and say, no, it's the guy that calls and makes believe he's a girl  and then finally, you know, talks like a man?  Uh-huh.  Well, the guy that usually does that is on the line.  Okay.  This is the guy that everyone was confused.  They thought it was this guy.  Hey, Will.  It's good to be your first coherent caller after the break.  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  Will, you really got to help us out today.  You've nailed us a few times with your little gag, and we all enjoyed it, but now we need to  have you on our side today, okay? 
[01:07:30]  No, it was not me, and I will go on a limb and put my credibility with you guys on the  line and say that is a chick.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Can you give us your fake female voice?  All right, I have a little cold.  Just so we can all compare.  Yeah, this is Jamie.  I'm calling from Brooklyn, and I love bisexual women.  That's good.  That's good.  That's really good.  Thank you, thank you.  Can you give Norton a Russian lap dance?  He's gotten us twice with that. 
[01:08:00]  That's great.  Yeah, but that's not me, most definitely, yeah.  Oh, man.  All right.  It's looking better and better.  It's looking good, then.  It is looking good for you guys.  What are some of the other things Keisha said?  She got junk in the trunk?  Say, I got junk in the trunk.  I got a little junk in the trunk for you.  It's that whispery thing.  That's another reason that made me think it really is a female, because when you can get  really loud like that, you're more likely to be a female. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  You're like, man, I say, man, I call you daddy.  Daddy.  Daddy.  Yeah.  Yeah, it don't sound like him.  No.  It's close, though.  That's what's scaring me.  No.  I'm feeling filthy talking to this guy.  You feeling confident that Keisha's for real?  I'm actually feeling quite confident.  Well, we'll find out.  Sure.  We'll find out Friday.  Listen, be confident, because I only use it for bisexual women, so it's not a gay thing.  Right.  There you go.  Listen.  Sure thing.  You keep telling yourself that.  As soon as... 
[01:09:00]  Okay, guys, whatever.  Tell yourself that even when Norton's big hand is on your big back.  As long as I don't see it, I'm fine.  All right, guys.  As long as I don't open my eyes.  That story's fascinating with Norton.  I hope I didn't ruin what's in my pants for you guys.  Nah, it's a funny gag.  All right, good, good.  Thanks, Wilf.  I'll see you guys later.  All right, I think the calls are wrong.  I think we might be on to something.  Yeah, I think so.  I think we're in luck on this one.  What the...  The Norton story with the hooker, when he picked up the hooker, and the hooker was doing treats 
[01:09:30]  on you.  Wonderfully, may I add.  Wonderful treats.  And, of course, Norton goes to put his hand on the hooker's back, get a little leverage  there, or whatever the hell you...  No, it's just to be a gentleman.  There'll be a nice guy, like knowledge that you know that the hooker's there, and a little  rubbing on the back.  Yeah, it's like a little thumbs up from your boss.  Right.  And what did you notice at that moment?  We like what you're doing for the company, James.  I honestly...  The thought that went through my head was, wow, this is a large back for a girl. 
[01:10:00]  And it was instinct, and my mules, and it was a shame, too, because they were world-class  treats.  Really?  Professional.  Good job, sir.  They know where all the good parts are, is what it is, because they're an owner.  Yeah.  That's why I hadn't considered that, and I just went, because I lost my rod, because I  really...  Instinct, I just went, this is a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I really had to go home and wash the breath off, and my buddy Tyler's knocking  on the door, going, how was it, man? 
[01:10:30]  How was it?  Because he didn't know.  You had to wash man breath off of yourself.  Awful man breath.  Oh, my God.  I think that makes you do it.  No, it doesn't, because I didn't know.  It's not like my rod got...  No, no.  You know something?  It doesn't make a...  It makes him a victim of mail fraud.  That's right.  Plus, I lost my rod.  It wasn't like I went, oh, God, sir, sir.  Yeah.  I lost my rod, and I went, what am I going to do?  Right.  You know, I already paid up front.  Silly me.  Silly you.  Let the buyer beware.  Copy on him, Tor.  Boss is calling back. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, great.  He demands that we put him back on the air.  That was the worst part of it, too, is after I realized it was the guy who looked up and  went, I know what I struggle.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Boss, you really want to do this?  No.  You really want to do this?  Well, no.  Listen to me.  Yeah.  All right.  Get it, Boss.  That was very, very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Why?  That was very uncomfortable.  Did you hear the nice plug we gave you after you hung up?  Yeah.  No, I didn't hear what you said, but...  Turn on your radio, stupid.  No, I can't.  You're not supposed to turn on your radio when you're listening to the radio. 
[01:11:30]  The delay, you would have heard some nice things.  Oh, really?  Well, here's the deal.  Let's just pretend I'm calling in to tell everybody where the sticker stop is tonight.  Uh-huh.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Hey, TJ wants to say hi to you.  Oh, God.  Here's a fight.  You demanded that we put you back on.  All right.  Put him on.  All right.  TJ.  Yo.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo.  Does it really make a difference if Boss is sick or not?  He's still not funny.  Have you been to any of my shows?  Yes, I have.  Where?  Where? 
[01:12:00]  I saw you get thrown in a lesbian pool at the L&A Roadshow.  Did I do well at the Roadshow, stupid?  Did I do well, stupid, when you were out in the audience watching me, you zero hang-up?  One chuckle.  One chuckle, and that was about it.  Yes.  Spot welder.  Shut up.  Hey, Boss.  Hello?  That was very funny.  I know.  I want to attack which Boss when he's on stage.  I do.  Maybe he's the guy to talk to you about that.  Ken Simons, yes.  Ken Staden-Symon.  I'll give him a ring. 
[01:12:30]  I'll give Ken a ring now.  All right.  Watermelon, pumpkin, where?  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Colin.  They kicked out of his hotel.  Doesn't have a call-like echo on our voices.  Actually, I don't think that has anything to do with our ratings.  I'm just trying to help you out here.  But I hate that.  Hello, hello, hello.  I got to go, go, go, go.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Colin.  It's a big back for a man.  Man, man, man, man.  I know the strong old song.  Yeah.  I hate that sound.  All right, Colin.  So talk to Ken Simons, maybe, is he the guy to talk to you about that? 
[01:13:00]  Ken Simons, yes.  Ken Staden-Symon.  I'll give him a ring.  I'll give Ken a ring now.  All right.  Watermelon, pumpkin, where?  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Colin.  Hey, Scott Pharrell, our morning guy here in New York, is checking in.  Kicked out of his hotel in here.  Kicked out of his hotel.  Doesn't have clothes.  He's begging one of the sales guys around here to get him.  A place to live.  Mm-hmm.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Yo, checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  Our new friend, Scott Pharrell, on the hotline, Anthony. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  He does mornings here in New York for us.  It's a good show, I'm telling you.  It's worth checking out.  The first morning show here in New York that we're openly promoting.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, he's got problems.  Lots and lots of problems.  Pharrell, hey!  Check it up!  What's up, Pharrell?  What's up?  Fellas, I'm crazy over here.  I'm crazy, crazy.  Hey, can I be honest with you?  Yeah.  Uh, I saw you this morning. 
[01:14:00]  Dude, you're a freak, man.  I saw you.  I was like, you got that freak with the long hair hanging out over there on Madison by the  palace.  I thought I was going to run into Leona Helmsley and give her a little bit of my push.  I saw you across the street waving in my direction.  Yeah.  And, uh, the dude, it was our agent.  He's in town, whatever.  He's so cute.  No, I'm thinking, wow, look at that drug dealer across the street trying to get our attention. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, no.  And then I said, oh, wait a minute, that's the morning guy for our station.  I just like that, like, conehead, like, purple, yellow, Steeler, and yellow, black.  Oh, that was giving me a little mahalo.  Shake it up.  Bacalooloo.  I looked across the street.  I go, oh, look who it is with a little jelly on his lip.  Jelly on my lip?  I saw you, man.  I knew you had cash in your pocket, though, because your boy, Mr. Flowmaster, is now running  my life, too.  I love that guy.  I went to a restaurant with him, and this hottie came up to me, and she said, hey, scratchy 
[01:15:00]  voice, you're Pharrell from the Mornings on N.E.W.  And she said, who knew I'd want to do you?  And then he said, hey, Pharrell.  Oh, let it all hang out.  Shake it up.  I love that guy.  He said, get some of that for breakfast.  I went, give me the stack of waffles and a little blueberry on top there, baby.  And then she said, people drink some pussy back.  She knew the show.  The first person he meets is a chick.  I love it.  I love that guy.  He's evil. 
[01:15:30]  Know why we like you?  Because we know you will blow yourself up.  Yeah, we're waiting.  Dude, you'd be surprised.  The other day, not only were we causing trouble, yeah, we hit on all the soap opera chicks,  but we see injuries over here on this side of town.  And today we're telling stories, old war stories.  Pharrell's hanging with all his buddies, cranking off freshies.  He's been doing it all day, picking a drink and yelling, screaming, has been the lavender,  hurling the torquing.  And then we turn on the Bob Hope Mafia Classic out in Palm Springs.  Last year, Pharrell played in it with Frank Nobolo.  I was hanging out with Justin Leonard, hanging out with your boy Yogi Berra. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, Pharrell, look how long I can go with you, fella.  And then I busted off a 75-chip at Indian Wells, and I said, I always liked that lady.  And I did, and I played with monsters that weighed 400 pounds, and they're living in Orlando  on their Mickey Mouse.  And you know what they say?  We've got to visit that place in Disneyland.  They've got someplace called an adventure.  Pharrell loves the roller coasters. 
[01:16:30]  Pharrell, what the F are you on, man?  We're over here hanging out, causing trouble, I told you.  Pharrell.  We're calling all the games.  We're picking games.  We're calling our bookies.  We've got them all on the take in Philadelphia.  They can't dance with us.  Only their hockey team's better than all of ours here in the local area.  I'm going to the game tomorrow night.  I already got a death threat.  Some guy wrote in and said he was going to slice my throat.  I was like, bring it.  I got something for you, Romeo.  Romeo, I get in fights. 
[01:17:00]  I always do.  It's crazy.  I end up giving them a little.  I get off a little action.  I get a little.  I got some joppy in me.  I got something for you.  Watch it come.  Here it is.  Did he get thrown out of his hotel?  Yeah, that's what we're trying to get to here.  Hey, boys, I got a show for you here.  Listen.  Hold on.  I got a special one for you.  Here we go.  Ready?

Scott, Scott, did you get thrown out of your hotel?  I have been evicted by the Hotel California. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  And I said, oh, I thought they liked me in Lipstick City.  Lipstick City.  And the guy said, we got a little problem.  You owe us 25 times.  I said, my friends over there with the roller coasters have something to do with it.  And they said, what are you going to do about it?  And I said, I got nothing to lose.  I say we show up down there in Central Park where they go ice skating and you and me go  elbows up.  Baby.  I'll give you a little left and a right, a shot, climb the ladder. 
[01:18:30]  Pharrell.  Get some of that.  You're, you're, you got, where are you now?  Dig it.  Where are you now?  I'm inside California.  Yeah, they tried to change my locks.  I put little bricks by the door.  They smell like blueberries.  They can't dance with me.  I've already threatened three people at the front desk.  They're putting us on the streets.  We're going to be called.  And we have a 14-month-old with this mother.  She's teary-eyed. 
[01:19:00]  She's rustled with all kinds of passion.  And not dying.  The father will be left with nothing but liberty.  You all, Bob.  Oh, heavens, please.  Good job cleaning up the city, Rudy.  I'm going to live over in, what is it, Gramercy Park.  I'm going to hang out near a light that blows like...  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Wah!

Lots of little soap operas.  Uh-huh.  Intertwined as we go through the afternoon every day.  What does this guy want?  Hank is saying that Keisha is definitely a guy... 
[01:20:00]  Oh, stop it.  ...he works with her.  Hank!  Yo!  What's up?  How you doing?  All right.  You rule, man.  Thank you, sir.  What do you know?  All right.  This guy, Chris, that's his name.  He works at the Wharton Business School at the University of Penn.  And he used to play his trick on the professors all the time.  And he got this one professor on tape.  He's a married professor.  Got him on tape and they were going to meet at a bar.  Uh-huh.  So now we got this tape and we always blackmail his teacher for our new grades. 
[01:20:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  So you're saying Keisha's a guy.  That's a guy, man.  Sophomore.  Sophomore in the Wharton Business School.  All right.  Thank you, Hank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice gag.  We'll find out Friday.  All right.  Keisha shows?  We'll know.  I ain't buying it.  If Keisha doesn't show for Philly, then we also know.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Exactly.  All right, Anthony, are you ready for Middle School Confession?  Yeah, I'm trying to find it on their website.  By the way, Adam Farrar in the studio. 
[01:21:00]  How are you?  Yes.  The job starts up again tonight, 930 on ABC.  It's a great show.  It really is.  Screw West Wing.  Check it out.  Thank you.  You're getting aft, my friend.  Yeah, I know.  You're getting aft.  Oh, stupid show.  What?  West Wing.  Nah.  I've never seen West Wing.  Who the hell's watching that?  Swear to God.  Hi, I'm the president.  About 24 million people.  I know.  I'm Martin Sheen, and I'm the president.  I'm out of the loop.  I'm buying that one. 
[01:21:30]  Saigon.  I can't believe I'm still in Saigon.  Well, air mobile.  He had a great aft though.  You remember that scene where he was going to close the door, buddy, or what?  That's great.  That's great.  All right.  We have 12 clips, Anthony, from Middle School Confessions.  This was a show that was on HBO, what, last night?  It debuted on HBO. 
[01:22:00]  They'll run it another 10 times.  Don't worry.  I can't find it on their website.  Well, it's a little saucy.  It's quite racy, if I must say.  Saucy and racy.  Saucy, you think?  A bit risque.  It's very risque.  And I'm amazed that these moms would allow HBO to film their slutty daughters in middle school.  Yeah.  If someone had to sign a release for that.  I didn't understand that myself, watching the tape.  The host, Samuel L. Jackson. 
[01:22:30]  Which is a little funny.  Really?  Yeah, he's talking about middle school kids having sex.  Which one's yours?  It's the one that says, bad mother f***er.  His wallet.  Get my wallet out of there, Ringo.  It's the one that says, bad mother f***er.  Yeah, so this is a show, kind of an expose on middle school kids. 
[01:23:00]  What is that?  Anywhere from 12 to 14 years old.  Talking about sex.  Talking about giving Hummers.  And drinking and what they do.  Talking about digits.  Digitally manipulated.  And we don't mean math.  By boyfriends.  Right.  And one girl with the braces.  The slutty girl.  And the other girl talking about how she's pure.  Let's just say, in every sense except the mouth.  Same girl.  Same girl. 
[01:23:30]  Braces girl.  Big face full of braces.  And she's just going to town.  Going to town.  And then the parents are talking.  And talking about how their kids, they don't know what their kids are doing.  And then there it is.  And you put this on HBO.  You know these kids are going to go back to school.  And hey.  Hey, you're the BJ girl.  From the HBO show.  They don't tell you what schools they attend, do they?  No, Norton.  And thank God they don't.  Well, they did tell us one school.  Yeah, that was the gay kid.  The gay middle school in Belleville. 
[01:24:00]  That Stinky went to.  Stinky went to that school.  Stinky went to the gay middle school.  I knew it.  The gay middle school.  It's right around the corner from this house.  Oh, my God.  A gay kid came out of there.  So what does that mean?  I don't know.  The school's gay.  It was at one point.  There's a pattern developing here.  Let's get Stinky in here for a sec.  Stinky, you went to that gay school?  You went to the gay middle school.  Everyone's gay at that school.  I couldn't believe it.  I didn't see it, but.  Yeah.  Was anyone gay when you were in middle school?  Of course.  You know, we were middle school. 
[01:24:30]  No, but you don't.  Gay people in school all the time.  Ones you know, ones you don't know.  You knew kids in middle school that were gay?  I didn't know them as far as like.  But you knew they were gay.  Oh, absolutely.  You didn't see kids that walk down the hall and you go, that kid's gay.  Yeah.  Whether he knows it yet or not.  He doesn't.  He's a choreographer.  Right.  They usually, yeah, they help out in the plays.  They help out in the plays.  But they're not acting in it.  They're doing the, you know.  And one, two, step two, turn two, step two. 
[01:25:00]  And I didn't even know in high school who was gay.  Swear to you.  I could say, well, a couple of the theater guys maybe, but I didn't know for sure.  That's what I'm talking about.  You knew for sure people, you knew for sure kids in middle school that were gay.  Yeah.  Because you saw them.  They acted, what do you call, gay.  Well, Ed, did you say one of those kids like when you were young or something hit on you or something?  Oh, that was in California.  And that was what?  Junior in there, so.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Did he give you a mouthful of a treat, did he? 
[01:25:30]  Ah.  Didn't get one.  Good for that, Jimmy.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Come on up.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Just a hug.  Yeah, no, there were kids in school that you knew.  In middle school.  In middle school.  And you're like, ah, the kid's gay, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Absolutely.  No clue.  Well, you've got to be a little observant.  They were usually very neat.  Yeah.  Right.  Tiny people.  Well, very, very friendly with some of the teachers. 
[01:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  Well-dressed.  Like that.  Well-dressed.  Tastefully appointed.  Right.  They would talk about things that the rest of the kids didn't talk about.  Yes.  You know, Broadway.  That's good.  And whatnot.  The graffiti on the notebook was like cash.  There's a kid who knew everything about, right, Broadway.  Kippin.  If you were in the play Bye Bye Birdie, does that mean you were gay?  Uh, depends on what you were doing there.  Were you the birdie?  If you were playing the girls, if you were playing some of the Bobby Soxers, I was, uh...  I'd say you were a little gay.  I sang a little.  Did you?  Really? 
[01:26:30]  I was one of the singing teenagers there.  What kind of an abomination play was that, that they got Opie singing it?  Were you really?  Did they give you a little blonde locks and tussle?  Tussle.  I was one of the singers there.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  And I can't carry it to him.  In the chorus?  Yeah, we were in the chorus.  We had to sit in chorus and work out the songs and stuff.  Uh-huh.  All right.  I had to sing and make believe I was on, you know, a telephone at the same time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's not even remotely gay. 
[01:27:00]  That's very masculine.  It's fine.  Yeah.  Did you live with Paul Lynn for a couple of years?  Oh, we got a clip of Opie on the phone at that time.  How fat for a topper.  Ho, ho.  Bye, bye, Barty.  Ho, ho.  Why is Stinky off the hook?  He was gay in middle school.  He grew out of it. 
[01:27:30]  We're wings all alone on the moon.  Ho, ho.  Stinky went to the gay school.  The gay middle school.  That's featured on the angel.  Yeah, so now these kids are back at school and not everyone is discovering them as the,  you know, the people from the BJ girl or the gay guy.  You know, all the teachers saw that.  Yeah.  And then they show the parents.  They had a whole group of parents that were in this, went into the middle school at night, 
[01:28:00]  I guess, with a sex education teacher.  And the sex ed teacher is the last time that...  She had sex.  I know.  Did you see her?  She looked like a guy from the gay school.  And she's sitting there and talking to these parents and saying things like,  what would be acceptable sexual behavior for your children at this age?  And then you get like the parents of the daughter that was given the Hummers is like,  French kissing, like saying little things.  It's like, no. 
[01:28:30]  How about deep throating?  Because that's what your gal is doing.  Ah!  Well, you can't say that, Hopi.  Brushing your teeth with that.  No.  I'm sorry.  You can't say that.  Did you learn that in the play?  Was that a portion of Bye Bye Birdie?  Easy.  So we got some clubs from middle school confessions.  The best part of the group meeting, though, quickly,  with the sex ed teacher between the parents,  the men, the fathers sitting there as they're asking these questions. 
[01:29:00]  It's just like, I'm not hearing you.  La, la, la, la.  Because what guy?  Because the second she starts talking about,  do you know this, that, the other thing, blah, blah, blah.  What, I can't say that?  I can't say it?  Just say aura.  I'm just, hmm, okay.  Practicing, doing oral.  Please, like that.  Nah, I'm sorry.  I had a curse right there.  I get so upset.  Don't put it out like crazy. 
[01:29:30]  With what we have to say.  Well, you've got to protect the kids.  I know, exactly.  I guess we could say they're innocent.  We could say oral, but we can't say oral plant.  Don't say that.  Yeah.  And you certainly can't say what Ann said.  No, no, no.  You can't say it, but if you go to middle school,  you can experience it.  You can do it.  Right.  Yeah.  So the fathers are just, they're getting these discussions,  and you know they're just images conjured up of their lovely little young gals doing this.  When they interviewed the parents, did they know what the kids have said, or did they just ask?  Some of them kind of had an inkling because of notes they found in their clothing and stuff like that, 
[01:30:00]  but I don't think they knew until this special that, you know, the brace-faced chick is half in the, like, crazy.  Oh, God.  And the other one, the 12-year-old that was getting the manipulation by the boyfriend, and she was horrified.  She was like, I found out because some anonymous twat sent her a note that ratted out the daughter.  And she's like, I got nauseous.  Yeah.  What a...  And I got very nervous. 
[01:30:30]  And then when my daughter got home, I addressed her, I gave her the note, and she said, it's true.  Oh.  Oh, so there's your little girl.  Daddy's little girl.  What a tattletale, that friend is.  I know.  What a beeswax.  God.  Isn't that awful?  Yeah.  Somebody, it was, it started, the note started, it takes a village.  What?  So, meaning that it takes everyone in the community to make sure everyone turns out okay.  You know, that Hillary Clinton bullcrap that she was spreading. 
[01:31:00]  My daughter got manipulated.  Now I'm dodging her.  Now I'm dodging her.  Oh, God.  I'll be in Cleveland, handing out bumper stickers.  Suffering suck-a-tache.  I'm boss.  Mertz, what's up?  Hey, I'm just calling, uh...  I'll get rid of the rabbit and make it look like an accident.  Wondering why you guys sent that no-talent hack, Voss, to thank us for your ratings.  Yeah, we should have sent Voss to Washington.  I know. 
[01:31:30]  That's punishing.  That's what I was thinking.  You know what?  If you want to thank us, send Norton.  He rules.  Yeah, Norton should go to Cleveland.  Voss should go to Washington.  That's how we should deal with this crap.  Chop the rabbit.  He brought us here.  All right, Mertz.  Go see Voss, in all seriousness.  You're going to have a great time.  All right.  Improv, uh, I don't know, now, tonight, through Sunday, or whatever.  Okay.  Hey, rabbit, you want to buy a dryer?  Go work.  So, uh, is the setup good?  Can we get to the clip?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:32:00]  We do have clips.  I believe this girl that you're about to hear is 12 or 13 years old, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  12 or 13, right?  All right.  13.  13.  Tender age of 13.  One of, oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  No pointing.  I'm ready.  All right.  Here it is from HBO.  Middle School Confessions.  At parties, while I'm drinking and I'm having fun, I think I engage in more sexual things  than I would normally. 
[01:32:30]  Sometimes I get really wild.  Those were probably the most times that I've been taken advantage of by guys.  I have woken up in the morning and just been like, I can't believe I did that.  What's all that yelling in the back?  That party that they're at.  Yeah, they're at a party where it's nothing but kids.  What were these parties when I was 12 and 13?  You know something?  Where are they now?  Nothing but kids groping each other.  This HBO thing, they had a camera around with 13-year-old kids just groping each other, 
[01:33:00]  making out, copping feels.  That one drunk girl on the couch clip, there's a couple of guys sitting on the couch.  This drunk chick, her head falls right into his lap.  She rolls over.  You just see her eyes going, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo in her head.  She smashed.  Smashed at 12, 13?  Yeah.  And this girl talking, you heard what she just said.  That's any hose bag anyone's ever known in their life.  And now instead of just maybe a few people in that school knowing, the country knows. 
[01:33:30]  Because she said, you know, I ain't got to fight.  Who don't know a hose bag like that?  Isn't this great news, too, all you soccer mom twats?  It's happening to your kids.  Yeah, this, believe me.  They're drinking out of mules left and right.  Oh, O&A are bad people.  Don't let them listen to that.  Watch out for the video games and they're blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Good for you, involved parents.  You know something?  You bring up a great point because this wasn't some inner city school with kids that were being neglected by their parents. 
[01:34:00]  This was all middle to upper class white kids going to parties at these nice houses of their friends and stuff and just hob and nob.  Nice village you live in.  They're saying that, and you know something?  Even the slut ones are virgins.  They're saying, you know, hey, I didn't give that up.  You know, that's like a way to rationalize it.  They don't give that up.  No, that would be wrong.  But, I mean, more icing than a strudel cake on their face on any given night. 
[01:34:30]  You know, I think intercourse is wrong, but I would rather, you know, gobble the love snot.  That's fine.  That's it.  That's a treat.  That's what they're doing.  Because they can't tell them no to parents.  Well, I want to have communication.  They don't tell them no.  And I'm glad they don't tell them no.  The more kids that do this, the happier I am.  I love it when these stupid parents are confused.  That's why sitcoms suck.  Because I have to hear about your kids and what they're going to hear.  Right.  And I love what they're doing behind your dumb soccer backs.  Except for the job, Adam. 
[01:35:00]  No, that's not a sitcom.  I don't care about that.  It's just a sitcom.  That's a dramedy on at 9.30 this evening on Channel 7.  Right.  It's a dramedy.  That's drama and comedy.  That's not like a bunch of cutesy little dialogue.  Like, uh-oh, look like Sliver is doing this stupid underdog.  We would have the 12-year-olds on the show.  Hey, Matt's a teacher.  Matt, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's Mark.  Someone hit Stinky.  He did not listen.  All right, Mark.  Sorry.  No, no problem.  I'm a 7th grade teacher on Allen, and I am not surprised about any of this at all. 
[01:35:30]  What grade you teach?  It doesn't matter.  7th.  7th or so?  All right.  7th grade.  There's 12 years old.  And the stuff they talk about in the hallways, guys, just blows my mind away.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm 25, and when I was in 7th grade, all I cared about was, like, baseball and  Akari Warriors on Nintendo.  No, I'm not going to go that far, because obviously, everyone was very, very, you wanted  to have sex at that age.  You're in middle school, and it's raging hormones, which they mentioned. 
[01:36:00]  And you wanted to have it.  But you know something?  It wasn't there.  It wasn't as easy.  No.  Oh, some people were getting it.  That's fine, you know?  And you'd pick and choose and get some stuff here and there.  It's part of growing up.  I had nothing to pick and choose from.  But these parties that they were showing on this HBO special, where they're drinking  and manipulating each other.  Dude, I lived four houses away from my middle school when I was in, like, 7th, 8th grade  on lunch break, because I had a Rolodex going all day. 
[01:36:30]  I would run home on lunch break, scrap, and then run back and feel guilty like all the  other kids know what I just did.  Dude, scrap.  Yeah.  That's, that is great.  Scrap.  Yeah.  I would go home, and I would go back and feel like the other kids all knew what I just  did, but I would look and think of all the heinies I saw.  Because they did, you filthy guy.  You filthy.  Hey, you want to hear another clip from middle school conventions?  Yes.  We got plenty of these.  All right, blah, blah, blah.  Check this out.  We haven't been going out very long.  I mean, it was sort of my first time. 
[01:37:00]  We were over at her house with, like, a whole group.  And, um, we were in a bedroom alone together.  So things got kind of out of control.  And we were making out and stuff.  And he ended up going down my pants.  At first, they told him not to, because I didn't want to.  And then, um, but he did it anyway.  And, you know, it did feel good.  And I did enjoy it. 
[01:37:30]  Oh.  By the way, the girl you just heard, 12 years old.  12.  What?  12.  12.  Psycho Mark.  What?  Where is she?  What's her number?  12.  Talking about going to parties.  Two.  Get in the room.  Now, this is stuff I absolutely recall happening at parties 15, 16.  Yeah.  That age, you know?  Mm-hmm.  You're going to the party.  You're doing it.  12?  Yeah, no.  At 12, I distinctly remember a great day was a Bic lighter and plastic army men in the woods. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  Or a magnifying glass and an ant hill.  And some bugs.  Sure.  We've got to get Nick on the line here.  Nick, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What do you got?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  How's it going, buddy?  I got a brother who's in middle school.  And a couple weekends, he's asked me to pick him up liquor.  He comes home the next day after sleeping over at Buddy's house. 
[01:38:30]  He's got better stories than I do on a weekend.  Yeah, right?  See?  This weekend, he's got planned on seeing Norton at the stress factory.  Free tug, Norton!  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You suck.  Yeah, they...  I didn't say a word.  You went from whore to pimp.  And there were always girls that would do this.  Yeah.  In certain schools or anything.  But they were the ones with the bad rep.  You know, the rumors of the girl would be like that.  And it wouldn't be a lot of girls. 
[01:39:00]  Now it just seems, oh my God, this is the...  If you could get a Hummer in junior high, you would have been king of the junior high.  And you would have to tell everyone.  Because there's one girl, I think we're going to have her clip in a little bit.  She was surprised that the guy told everybody else at school.  Things changed.  Things flip-flopped.  Because I remember it was a lot easier to get laid than it was to get a Hummer.  Back in the day.  When I was 12, I didn't even know they would do that. 
[01:39:30]  Forget about even getting it.  Yeah, I didn't know that was...  I didn't know that was part of the world.  You didn't know that was possible?  I didn't know that was one of the...  Oh, I knew...  I was looking at hardcore porn iron pieces.  I knew there was a world out there.  Yeah, exactly.  Eight years old, I'm looking at hardcore.  But you'd find it in the woods and it was rained on.  With the color pages.  It was like all smutty black and white pictures.  And then in the middle, there were maybe six color pages with just nasty, hardcore C-shots  all over the face and everything. 
[01:40:00]  Right?  I used to steal Wii Magazine.  This is seventh grade.  Yeah, Wii and Penthouse out of a machine.  I would take a screwdriver and Jimmy the machine and steal it and just go home and arc them all  over myself.  You guys were acting like, wow, I didn't mean there was kissing in high school?  What are you talking about?  Those are the days you'd get a good magazine, you'd go once.  And then follow it up right away.  Piazadora.  Keep going.  Oh, the Piazadora issue in the bathtub.  I don't remember.  Oh, yeah.  I remember the bathtub.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Piazadora. 
[01:40:30]  Sure.  Kevin from D.C.  I don't know if this is true.  Kevin?  Hey, O&A, man.  What up, Morton?  Hey, sir.  Hey, I swear to God, guys, this is true.  It's about a year ago.  The kid was 14 years old, like a white suburban middle school in a suburb of D.C.  This kid was running a little prostitution ring out of his high school.  He had a handful of girls.  High school?  Or middle school.  Middle school.  14 years old.  So, what, about eighth grade or whatever?  Yeah, there you go.  Swear to God, he was running this prostitution ring.  He had about ten girls, I guess. 
[01:41:00]  Because I could see how kids that age would think it was cool and kind of fun and kinky  and something you're not supposed to do.  Excuse me, how much was he asking to see somebody?  Norton loves these quotes.  Make sure they have a feminine back.  It's a large back for a gal.  How you doing?  We got our pleasure menu.  We'd like to see it.  Girls do enjoy tipping.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  Hey, hey, hey.  I want to let you guys something to know. 
[01:41:30]  I've listened to you guys since you came on the radio, man.  Keep up the ratings.  You'll be there one day.  Don't worry.  Thank you, Gipper.  The rumor is they're not giving us much time.  Don't worry about it, guys.  You'll make it.  Take it easy.  We're much more time.  All right.  I want to hear it.  Troy from Jersey.  He's saying, at 12, didn't party mean you were going to the roller rink for someone's birthday  and ice cream cake?  Hell yeah.  Now partying is...  Here's another clip from Middle School Confession. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  I think this is another 12 or 13-year-old, right?  12.  12.  12.  I think, personally, the sexual things that you could do is, like, have a guy f*** you  and you, like, maybe, like, give him a handy.  And, like, I think, like, it's okay, like, if, like, he fills you up and you guys, like,  make out that, like, at this age.  But I just don't think it's okay, like, to go, like, all the way.  See, there's the rationale that was never in place when I was in school. 
[01:42:30]  It's perfectly acceptable.  There was either girls that did it or did not do it.  That's why you effed and you got the Hummer and you got the whole package, but it was very  hard to get.  Now it's broken up a la carte.  The girls are a la carte.  I'm sorry.  We don't have the V.  We don't have V on the menu tonight, but we'd be happy to give you the Hummer and the Handy  if you want to take that out.  And, well, let's see what's on the back of the menu.  Flip it over because that's acceptable, too. 
[01:43:00]  As long as the V is kept fresh.  Can I substitute the digital manipulation for the fries?  Yes, absolutely.  I'll write that down.  Let me check with the kitchen.  Even though it's a school night, is that possible?  Can I get something delivered?  So now it's all divvied up.  And the Hummer has turned into something that was akin to maybe making out.  Yeah.  You know?  Now it's like, hey, I don't go all the way, but yeah, I'll throw you that.  Oh, jeepers.  Gee, you bitch. 
[01:43:30]  Who wouldn't be skipping la la la through the hallways the next day if girls were doing that?  I'm 35.  My last Hummer cost me a tennis bracelet.  All right?  Nice.  Yeah.  We have lots of these clips.  We'll play one more before we take a break.  All right.  What is this one?  Middle School Confessions from the HBO show.  This is a little clip about Oral.  Oh.  From a 12-year-old.  That's something new.  I think Oral is okay to do because it's not an intercourse. 
[01:44:00]  And, um, I just feel that it's okay.  Uh-huh.  I don't know why.  A foreign trooper.  Isn't that...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Atta girl.  This is like a psycho.  That makes me want to have kids.  Oh.  How much?  In what way?  That makes me want you to have kids.  I'm happy.  Is...  It's amazing.  Imagine the parties. 
[01:44:30]  These are kids.  I'll babysit, Norton.  These are kids that were on camera.  Nothing blocked out.  You didn't have any, uh, digitizing of the face or anything.  These...  Not electronically, anyway.  And the parents of these girls that you just heard are on there talking about sex.  Is that something to do to your kid?  Yeah.  If she's doing it, hey, what are you going to do, you know?  Well, but then to splash it all over HBO, let me use the term, splash, it just seems to 
[01:45:00]  me like, like, you shouldn't be allowed to do that.  What's the bumper sticker say?  My kid's a hose bag.  Yeah, yeah.  Ask me about my slutty granddaughter.  Proud to be the parents of a receptacle.  My daughter gave a Hummer to an honor student.  Ask me about my sea dumpster.  That girl can suck the color out of a marble. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  They seem very fine with, uh, with this going on.  Hey, Paul, what's going on?  Check this out.  Hey, man.  Hey, I got the story.  My brother, he was 10 years old, and he had this little teeny bopper girlfriend.  Guess they were at her house, and their parents weren't there.  Girl starts giving him a Hummer.  My brother starts looking around like, what the hell is going on?  Oh, my God.  Kid had no idea what was going on.  Teeny bopper is giving away Hummers like Tic Tacs these days. 
[01:46:00]  Look at this.  Matt from Jersey has a whole timetable.  Yeah.  He goes, I'll settle things right now.  Here's the timetable.  Twelve, Handies.  Thirteen, Hummers starting of booze.  At fourteen, you get the digits.  And the lucky ones have sex.  Booze way up.  Pot smoking starts.  Fifteen, more sex booze.  Everyone smokes pot.  Sixteen, who hasn't at least gotten a Hummer at this point? 
[01:46:30]  And then he says, Hummers are like promotional tools today.  It's like a throwout, a promo that you throw out there to let people know what they're in for.  Like a keychain.  Right.  It's a promotional tool.  It's a maglite flashlight with your phone number on it.  It's a good to know you.  Hey, how you doing?  Sally for class president.  It's like, how are you?  Yeah, those school elections must be something these days.  And we should take a break. 
[01:47:00]  When we come back, we got the clip, the virgin talking about how she's a virgin except for her mouth.  It's wonderful.  She's got a tattoo on her chin that says, Merging Traffic.  Beware.  Keep hands and feet away from the hopper at all times.  Middle school confessions continue on the O.P. and Anthony Show next.  The Naughty Nighty Contest starts next week on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Stay tuned for details.  And here we go.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:47:30]  A big thank you to Buffalo today, Ant.  Buffalo, you guys, you rock, man.  Buffalo gave us what Washington did it.  Yes.  Washington gave us the clap yesterday.  Yeah.  But Buffalo, man, wow.  Buffalo was as sweet as a 12-year-old girl.  Oh, God.  Ant.  It was starring in The Job tonight, 9.30 on ABC.  ABC. 
[01:48:00]  Season premiere.  Tonight's episode, Sacrilege.  Sacrilege.  That's the Quinn Martin voice.  A Quinn Martin voice.  Epilogue.  Lisa wants in on this discussion.  Lisa, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just have an opinion on why these young kids are doing some serious fooling around.  Yeah.  You think maybe your show has a little something to do with it?  Oh, yeah.  That's what it is.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I hope so.  Our show.  Our show has something to do with it.  A little something to do with it?  That's Lisa.  No, maybe it's parents that don't pay attention to their kids. 
[01:48:30]  Don't do parenting.  And blame it on other things.  Or maybe it's just slutty hose bags.  Well, the guys are, too, from my opinion.  I mean, they're looking for it.  A guy's idea?  Well, you think that's hot?  No, I don't.  That's supposed to sound sexy.  No, I think parents are very responsible, but I think it also helps when there's shows  like yours on the air.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Don't listen, you squat.  Oh, you're so funny, guys.  How old were you?  Keep listening.  Lisa.  Pardon me?  How old were you?  Lisa, you sound really stupid because you're obviously listening to our show today. 
[01:49:00]  Yep.  If we're not funny or entertaining, then why are you listening to the show?  Because I'm very intrigued by what you guys are talking about.  There you go.  There you go.  Thank you.  It's a really important subject.  Tell your friends.  Right.  It's an important subject.  Good luck to you and your pig children, stupid.  Oh, you're sweet, Norton.  I can see why more people like you.  Why do you talk with that stupid fat girl?  God, do you hear that?  Hey, Alex, baby, she's like, yeah, she's like, yeah, she's like, yeah, she's like, yeah.  What's stupid fat girl? 
[01:49:30]  You guys finished now?  No, stupid.  We're not.  Finished now.  We're not your boyfriend, so you can't kick us around and inescalate us like the twat you are.  Poor guys.  Are you finished now?  That's funny.  Is that what your husband says?  Yeah.  Okay, guys, I'm finished.  Finished now?  Yeah, you are.  Hang up and suck.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Nice try, Lisa.  Nice try.  Bye-bye.  Keep listening, though.  Yeah.  Intriguing.  We certainly could use the listeners in the D.C. area. 
[01:50:00]  That's the girl that scrubs the toilet right after you beat her.  That's what I like.  I listen because I'm intrigued.  I scrub because it was dirty and it hit me.  At least she knows my name, though.  She must be listening.  Gee, Lisa, you heard it.  Well, Jamie shows like you.  Sorry, guys.  Oh, imagine having to go home to that voice.  So, I guess it wasn't important enough to do that.  You know, with the fake laughing lilt to the voice when she's pissed off and she puts on  that, well, why wasn't the long cut today? 
[01:50:30]  I guess other things were too...  Bam in the face!  You know what that is?  That's trying...  That's passive-aggressive.  Yeah.  Because for many years, Daddy snuck into the room at night, so you really never learn  how to express your anger at men.  Call back, stupid, and just say, it sucks.  I hate you.  Have some courage.  Don't call up and try to be smarmy and smug.  You're not bright enough for it.  Yeah.  Smarmy.  Yeah, but that smugness is...  You've got to be really smart to pull that off, and that lilt gave you away.  All right.  More clips from Middle School Confessions, the show that was on HBO last night, okay? 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  12, 13-year-old girls talking about stuff.  Yeah, this was some...  This is the Virgin Girl.  The Virgin Girl, Anthony.  Virgin Girl.  How old?  12, 13.  I think she's 13, this one.  Yeah.  13?  Yeah.  This is 13.  Listen, what's going on?  I'm kidding.  I've never slept with anybody.  I'm still purely virgin, except for my mouth.  Cool.  I didn't hear that.  There's got porno music in the background. 
[01:51:30]  I didn't hear that.  Could you replay that?  I'm kidding.  I've never slept with anybody.  Never slept with anybody.  I'm still purely virgin, except for my mouth.  Okay.  Terrific.  And you know why?  It's because of this show.  Yeah, that's it.  And it has MFP fluoride, so it's good for your teeth.  I hope it is because of this show.  You know how great that would be?  Yeah.  It's our show.  Chrissy!  Yeah.  Hey.  I've got to tell you guys, thank you, because I've got a 13-year-old daughter, and I'm now 
[01:52:00]  never letting her out of the house.  Are you dodging her?  Sorry, why?  You're not letting her out of the house?  No.  Never.  No.  Thank you for...  I didn't see this on HBO, and I'm sharing this now.  Chrissy...  I'm messing myself.  Chrissy, do you know what she's up to, if anything?  I keep a pretty tight rein on her, so yeah, I think I know what she's up to.  You know something?  And then, so did these parents, man.  To watch this special, it's like...  Oh, tell me that.  Oh, my God.  Does she go over to a friend's house?  Of course she does.  Does she ever spend the night? 
[01:52:30]  Yes, she does.  Get her jaw wired.  Do you know...  No.  Don't say it.  Don't even say it.  Does she have friends that maybe you'd prefer she didn't hang out with?  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  She did.  Not anymore.  She did.  She used to hang out with them.  There were a couple of girls that I put my foot down.  You got it?  She fell in with a fast crowd.  No, not anymore.  No, huh?  No, no.  And what's the worst thing that you...  But no, you know what?  What's the worst thing you caught her doing? 
[01:53:00]  I haven't caught her doing anything really bad.  At this point, her and her girlfriends that she's around now, they talk about having crushes  on boys, but...  Crushes.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, any house parties that she goes to, there's parents there.  Yeah.  And anything else is a school activity.  12-13.  Yes, boy.  How much of a roller rink?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, looks like Chrissy's doing a good job playing.  Thank you, sir.  She's doing the best she can.  Godspeed, and good luck to you.  Good luck to you. 
[01:53:30]  Thank you, guys.  I mean it.  Thank you for playing this.  All right, Chrissy.  Well, this next clip is going to make you drive off the road, so...  Hold on tight, all right?  All right.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Well, this is a girl talking about Oral.  Anthony?  All right.  12-13.  13.  13.  With Oral, it's really kind of fun to do because when the guys get it, they kind of give you  more attention for it, and they're really happy with you and stuff like that. 
[01:54:00]  Sure.  They're happy with you, and they give you more attention.  They learn young.  Yeah.  That's a healthy home life.  Jesus.  Boy, I hope...  They give you more attention.  Boy, I hope Sandy's listening.  Oh, my God.  Dude, she's going to slap your face, man.  You know what's sick?  I'm going to ask my girlfriend.  Now you've got to punch him.  Now I've got to punch him.  You've got to punch him.  Not hard this time.  But that's actually a good point.  The kid raises a good point. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  You want love and attention?  Well, what are you bringing to the table?  Hey!  You know, a lot of these girls, I think some of the clips they play later, they're saying  this, that they don't want the guys to do anything to them.  They don't want...  They don't want to receive...  They don't want to be left alone.  They just want to give the Hummers.  Right.  Because, you know something?  If you're a guy, and you're laying back, and you're getting that, and believe me,  at that age especially, how thankful you are at that, that girl is a goddamn princess 
[01:55:00]  right there.  Yeah.  What she's doing.  And they can see it in the way you're lifting your ass off the couch.  You know what I mean?  So, of course, they're going to dig doing it.  Pulling a lint out of your ass.  Yeah.  More commentary on Oral, Anthony.  Where did the upholstery go?  Oral in the middle schools.  Ah, right.  From middle school confessions from HBO. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  My boyfriend and I were going out for about six months before I gave him...  And we liked each other a lot.  It was kind of like, I can't believe I did that, but after, I was like, okay, that's  cool.  Little giggles.  Yeah.  I like when they giggle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, they giggle right when you take your pants down.  It's not good. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  And they point and squint.  Where is it?  Things like that.  Squint.  Nothing like a fond, girlish giggle, though.  It looks like one, only smaller.  When they say that, it's bad.  One day that'll get hair.  You know, it's just...  Awful.  It's amazing...  What?  ...that they put this on TV.  What are the parents thinking?  That's what they're saying about our radio show out there, and... 
[01:56:30]  I'd be like...  You know something?  It's amazing.  They put this on TV.  I'm all for it, and I'm not talking about telling HBO they shouldn't air this.  Right.  Or any kind of censorship.  I'm talking about parenting and going, if you get a kid that's saying this on TV, in  front of a camera, and you then sign a release that says, yeah, fine, because the kid can't  sign the goddamn release.  The parents gotta sign it.  Can't?  It'll be in crayon.  The parents gotta sign it.  Oh, yeah.  Put my daughter talking about how she hobbs it on television. 
[01:57:00]  I'm sure it's gonna be great for the father when he goes to the office on Monday.  Yeah.  It's not like HBO's catching on or anything.  I don't think the neighbors have it.  Hey, Tom, isn't tomorrow bring your daughter to work day?  Hey, hey.  It's just a fan.  I'll bring the lube.  Bring your daughter to work day tomorrow there, Bob.  I saw your daughter on HBO last night.  We're all eagerly awaiting by the water cooler.  What's it?  Bring your little whore hose bag to work day tomorrow. 
[01:57:30]  Stupid parents allow us.  Very stupid.  Stupid parents.  I'm thankful.  This one's gonna be so stupid.  This one's gonna make some moms drive off the road, Anthony.  The next clip from Middle School Confessions.  Okay.  More about oral.  People think that, like, that's going way too fast.  But a lot of people are doing it now.  So, I kind of wanted to create a closer relationship with my boyfriend.  But then, he kind of thought that once he got it once, he's gonna get it often. 
[01:58:00]  And it got us closer.  But we broke up after.  Oh, he dumped her afterwards, huh?  He thought he was gonna get it all the time.  You know.  God damn.  A lot like marriage.  It's just, she gives it to him once, and it's like, come on.  It's been five minutes.  Ladies, don't you know that's like feeding a puppy?  You know when you put milk outside the door?  That dog ain't leaving.  Right. 
[01:58:30]  And where would she record this?  A daycare?  What was going on in the back?  I know.  Do you hear the background?  One of the house parties.  That was at, yeah.  They went into one of these house parties.  That was a little house party going on.  As they're talking about oral.  Woo.  How about that?  But I thought my daughter was going to see Harry Potter.  They said they were gonna go see Harry Potter.  Harry Potter?  I didn't know.  Harry Potter.  Harry Poker and the Saucer's Bone.  I never had reason to doubt her before this.  Harry Potter?  The parents love when we do stuff like this. 
[01:59:00]  They love stories like this.  Vinny!  Yo, what's up, man?  What's up?  I got a 13-year-old son and a 17-year-old son.  The only part is, like, the first time you catch them having sex, the first thing that  goes to your mind is, oh, no!  And then the second thing that goes to your mind is, oh, thank God, they're not gay!  Oh, there you go.  It's, like, totally different, you know?  If I had a daughter, tonight she'd be, like, handcuffed in the basement.  I'd be concrete and over the door.  She'd never get out.  But your 13-year-old, you know, has had sex already? 
[01:59:30]  Uh, well, I know he's gotten something from somebody, because his friends called him  up one day, and he's like, yeah, she was hot, and she tasted nice, too, so I figured  he was getting a little something.  That could be anything, though.  Maybe a little nuzzle on the neck.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It got a little more graphic than that.  I can't quite explain it to you.  You heard that from your 13-year-old?  Yeah.  He was talking on the phone.  Good boy, though.  He's going south already.  He's a team player, that guy.  That's nice.  That's nice. 
[02:00:00]  I called my 17-year-old son in the backseat of my friggin' Mercedes, in the goddamn garage.  I go downstairs to get, like, a friggin' 12-pack out of the garage.  I open up the light case, and I'm...  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hey.  Oh.  Hold on, because you can't say the T word.  Danger.  Danger.  I saw her feet up on the windshield and a pair of her T's.  Yeah, it just popped up, and I was like, the first day that came to him, I was,  he's having sex, and then it was like, but he's not gay. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Thank God, he's not gay.  Do we have the clips from the middle school gay guys?  All right.  Hey, that girl, uh...  I gotta go.  You're talking about gay stuff.  I don't even want to think about that.  All right, Vinny.  Vinny, the girl he was with didn't have a big back, did she?  No, but she had a nice rack.  All right, Vinny.  Thank you.  Vinny's right.  My big sex talk from my father, my father walked in my room and went,  Adam, uh, don't kiss guys, huh?  Please.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:01:00]  That was the sex talk.  That was it.  Big Joe.  Yeah.  Big Joe.  Our buddy Nick Carter checking in.  Nick.  Holy effing garanimals, man.  Did you see this special?  Dude, you gotta give it to HBO.  Between this show and Oz, you can almost experience a weekend at Norton's house.  Exactly.  Of course, from the comfort of your own home.  And the safety.  All right, you know, and the amazing thing about it, like I heard you talking about this  earlier, they didn't digitize any of the faces.  No.  You know, every single one of these kids is going to be reliving this show on an analyst 
[02:01:30]  couch for years to come.  Hell yeah.  Not only that, think of the action they're going to get now that it's been splashed all  over cable television, HBO, that they're goers, man.  What about...  Oh, yeah.  You know, they're going to be checking in their email, you know, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do we have anything, any extra credit homework?  Hey, what are you doing later on?  All right, saw your TV appearance.  Yeah.  I'm a 38-year-old man, and I thought you were so hot on HBO. 
[02:02:00]  33.  Of course.  And that's the neighbor.  We're going to glance up Dotto 3 tournament over the house.  How about if you come over for a little bit?  Yeah.  I mean, just for a second, go back to elementary school.  I mean, think about it.  I mean, you know, I mean, it was a good night.  At the end of the night, if you went to a dance, you had your hands on some girl's ass.  Yeah.  That was about it.  I know.  I mean, now you feel like a loser if you didn't get laid.  And if you'd known any of this was going on then, why would you even try to progress  to high school? 
[02:02:30]  You'd stay in middle school.  I went to plenty of parties at that age, and parties that, you know, there was some drinking  going on, but nothing, nothing like they were talking about last night, going into rooms  with the Hummers and stuff.  Nothing like that.  I was talking about this briefly earlier today on the show, and I'm like praying to the fertility  God.  Should the day come that I ever do have kids, if I have a little girl, I'm going to kill  myself.  Yeah.  I don't know how guys with girls that are 13, 14 are even dealing with life. 
[02:03:00]  You've got to figure, you've got to figure, every single kid, especially little girls  under the age of, I would say even 15 now, they're grounded for life.  Even, you know, even the Wallflowers.  Anybody who saw that show, nope, you're not getting out of the house.  Sorry.  You just know.  I just plan to cancel until you're 30.  Anytime if you're a father, and I can't even imagine, you know, and I don't want to,  if you're a father of a girl that age, and you've raised her all those years, and then  you hear things and just are picturing her doing those things to some filthy, 
[02:03:30]  see, it's just like, it's got to kill you, guys.  Guys, it's got to kill you.  Well, my first thought was, you know, my first thought was, these kids, especially the little  girls, especially the girls, the poor little thing with the braces, I'm like, does she  even realize what she's saying?  No.  She will a couple of years from now.  Somebody sits down and explains it to her.  She just looks at this tape and says, oh my God, what have I done?  Daddy, with the same eyes, she looked at you all happy when you gave her that first Barbie 
[02:04:00]  doll on her birthday, as she was wearing the little, I'm eight-year-old tiara on her  head, princess dress for her birthday.  It's the same eyes that are now spinning around giving the fish eye as, uh...  You're killing the fathers today, man.  As she's getting a load of tapioca on the back.  Every father driving home now, God damn it, I should have just given her a pony.  All right, Nick.  I'm going to go bathe in holy water and try to redeem myself.  Yeah, sure.  Right on. 
[02:04:30]  There he goes.  Our buddy, our pal.  Nick Carter.  God damn.  From Boston.  Isn't that just awful to think?  And the fathers out there right now, I don't know how you're driving with both hands over  your ears, going, no, no, no, no.  La, la, la, la, la.  Hey, Danny, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  A couple years ago, I was in my parents' house, and I pick up the phone.  This is what I hear.  I hear my brother talking to his girlfriend.  He goes, she goes to him, next time, I want to do it to you in the shower.  Guys, they were 12 years old. 
[02:05:00]  Do it to you in the shower.  That's great.  There you go.  12 years old.  But it's like Matthew McConaughey said in Days of Confused.  That's what I love about these girls.  I get older, they stay the same age.  Oh, shit.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you, Danny.  Remember Daniela, the last girl that did the wiffle ball bat challenge, Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  She's on the line.  Daniela.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  What's up?  Actually, I think I have something to, like, blow all you guys away.  Oh, oh, away.  Good.  Okay.  All these girls, like, all right. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  The first time I ever kissed a girl, like a heavy kissing girl, I was in kindergarten.  Really?  Her name was Janine.  And you had her milk money.  Kindergarten?  I was, like, five or six years old.  What the hell possessed you guys to do that?  You know what's funny?  There were no wiffle ball bats around.  That could be something you saw on television you're imitating.  Was it?  No, I'm serious.  Like, she would call in my house and we would, like, just start getting it on.  In kindergarten?  I was five years old.  What was, if you remember, please let us know, what was in your mind? 
[02:06:00]  What the hell, like, made you do that?  I don't know.  Like, I just found her so attractive and, like, just one thing led to another.  I remember I used to go over to her house and we used to, like, do things.  She used to go over to my house.  We used to do things.  It was, like, a, like, it went on for, like, three weeks.  And then she moved to Florida.  A whirlwind affair.  A whirlwind affair.  But I still remember her fondly.  We were.  Like, now I'm listening to, like, 13-year-olds talk about how they do oral and stuff like that. 
[02:06:30]  But, like, I think that's a beautiful thing.  Like, you know, if you're going to explore your sexuality like that, that's fine.  Hey, so, uh, were you like that at, uh, 13 or something?  Oh, yeah.  You were given the oral.  Oh, definitely.  And I was receiving it, too.  I think it's a beautiful thing, really.  Jumping Jehoshaphat.  How about that?  Look, everyone is silent looking around.  Ay, ay, ay.  What the hell?  Five.  I don't get five.  But, like, what were you guys like at 13?  Like, it's, like, it's something you do.  I was nowhere near that stage.  I was whacking my bag. 
[02:07:00]  I was just introducing myself to myself.  Wow.  I was about it.  Yeah, I was locked in my bag.  I had a towel in my room I could use as a lampstand.  But that's horrible.  You should have went out, like, I'm sure if you guys went out and looked for girls to  do that, they would have done it for you.  I'm sure.  No, we're guys.  That ain't sure I was.  They're just getting rid of all that evidence and the police coming over to investigate.  Duct tape.  Garbage bags.  What are you going to do?  I'm not taking a haul.  Look, I'm not saying there was all kinds of experimentation going on with the girls. 
[02:07:30]  There was, like, the kissing stuff.  But at five years old, I mean, you like a girl, you just push them.  You know, that's the emotional range.  Yeah, that's fine.  I kissed the girl.  Yeah, I know you did.  We listened.  I remember when I was, it had to be at least eight years old or something, making out in  the basement of the apartment complex with a girl.  And it was like, you know, that might as well have been sex, because it's all I know.  Was she running her fingers through your afro?  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  My Angela Davis afro. 
[02:08:00]  I went to the people afro.  Thank you, Danielle.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Young Lawrence Hilton Jacobs finds love.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  How many more clips we got?  We only got three more to go.  Only three?  You want to try to get through this?  Okay.  Another clip on, well, what a surprise.  Oral, and?  More oral in middle school.  So, giving a s*** has nothing to do with your body.  They don't have to see you or feel you or judge you in any way.  It's kind of like you're in control and stuff. 
[02:08:30]  I think I'd feel more comfortable with something that I wouldn't know, because if I did it wrong,  it's okay, because I'm not going to see him again.  Wow.  Okay.  All she had to say to that was a silver Saturn.  Oh, Jesus.  That was that girl with the braces again.  She's the 13-year-old with the braces, talking about how, hey, she likes doing it.  The guys don't have to touch her or see her body or anything like that, because she says 
[02:09:00]  she's a little self-conscious.  And she prefers it with people she doesn't know, because if you do it wrong, it doesn't  matter.  You don't have to see him again.  She's a glory hole.  Jesus.  Yeah.  A glory hole with shoes.  That's it.  It is.  A glory hole with a bus pass.  Yeah.  A traveling glory hole.  And for some reason, the parents felt it was perfectly fine to put her on a television.  Very important that their daughter would.  That their daughter would talk about what a whore slut she really is. 
[02:09:30]  How do you do?  Well, honey, I wanted her to take dance lessons, but if you think this is good for her, I'll  sign the release.  I'll sign away.  She wants to act.  So she said she sucks what?  Okay.  I'll write that okay.  Fine to air.  Go ahead.  Fine to air.  There you go.  That's my gal.  She's a kid, you know?  Yeah.  She's 12.  Hello.  Rainbow.  Rick, what's this next clip?  Skip this one. 
[02:10:00]  It's labeled not so good.  No, she's just talking about something she did or whatever.  It's just a giggling loop.  Not so good.  She doesn't see her 13-year-old girl.  And especially being the youngest in the family, she sees me as being the baby, I think.  And sometimes I feel as though I'm being treated like a baby, so I don't want her to know  any of the things that I do that are not so good.  Treated like a baby.  Here's your binky.  You need your binky.  And one more clip.  Right?  Are we coming back to play the clips of the gay kids in middle school? 
[02:10:30]  Sure.  All right.  I feel like I've completely lost all my innocence.  When you're a little girl, you, like, when you see kids on TV, it's like, ugh.  And, like, when you do, you're like, mm-hmm.  Being intimate and oral with guys is just like, you're not that little girl that wears hair  and piggy tails and ate a cake with frosting all over her face.  Like, you know, you can't change the past, so I guess there's nothing I can do about it. 
[02:11:00]  That's the beginning of a porno movie.  Yeah.  With the music and everything.  The music goes into a dream sequence, and it goes in on the strippers.  All you need is Max Hardcore.  That's it, you lady.  That's it.  That's it.  Either that or the other video collection where you write the C-word on her forehead and smack her in the face.  But Max Hardcore is the originator of that guy, the whole, uh...  That genre.  That genre.  What was that series called?  That was called Slap Happy. 
[02:11:30]  Slap Happy.  I'm sorry, Jim Norton.  Silly me.  Tim, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Long-time listener.  Second-time caller.  I've got a three-month-old daughter, and what you guys are talking about is absolutely scaring the hell out of me.  You've got a good four or five years before you have to start worrying, according to some of our friggin' callers.  I think I'm going to go over and get the stapler out and staple up a few things.  Holy ass.  I don't know what you could possibly do, aside from moving to some barren wasteland in Alaska, 
[02:12:00]  and then she'd probably come home with a moose.  I'm just thinking there's nothing a guy can do if you have a daughter, because they come from the best of homes,  they come from the worst of homes, the parents think they're doing a good job,  the parents are doing a crappy job, and they wind up becoming doctors and whatever.  They do a great job.  They rebel against the parents because they're giving them too much, and they become hosebags.  There's no rhyme or reason to it, my friend.  You just effed up, and one of those Y chromosomes or something kind of... 
[02:12:30]  Well, guys, it's certainly scary.  You also remember when you were 14 trying to do anything and everything possible.  Of course.  And it's only gotten worse.  You have a daughter, that's for sure.  You remember knocking on some guy's door and asking for his daughter when you were a kid?  Never did that.  Sorry, she came off home right now.  I know the struggle.  She's dodging me, too.  All right, Tim, thank you.  Hey, guys, have a good day.  Bye.  You stay in this room.  I'm going to Cleveland to hand out stickers. 
[02:13:00]  You're not leaving until I get back.  Is that Blair of Psycho, Mark?  No, I was going to say, the parents are morons.  Who would ever put their daughter on national TV?  Well, that's retards.  That's the point we're making.  Retards.  Yeah, that, apparently, you can see where they went wrong.  That ain't going to help the situation, right?  Right.  Dude, 13 or 14 years old, I mean, that is not even old enough to get into the stress factor this weekend.  But it is old enough to watch television that tonight, at 9.30, the job would happen for our...  You whores, man.  You're bigger whores than these girls we've been listening to. 
[02:13:30]  Anthony, I think our friends are starting to take advantage of us.  Yeah, it's going to happen.  Damn you, Adam.  We were so nice.  We're freewheeling.  We allow our guests to freewheel.  And that's what they use their time for.  Plug their horse gigs.  Yeah.  You're right.  There are some really hot stories coming in on Instant Feedback, but...  We're trying to show some responsibility today with this subject.  Dana from Cleveland. 
[02:14:00]  So she became active at 10.  Mm-hmm.  With digitally.  And at 11, orally, with girls.  Whoa.  Whoa.  14, lost it to a boy.  This is all on the Instant Feedback, man.  And 17 became oral with boys.  Maybe she can come in.  We can break out the lesbian crib.  Oh, jeez.  There you go.  Hey, let's take a break. 
[02:14:30]  Let's take a break, everyone.  And then we come back.  What do we got?  The gay guy clips from the same series.  Yeah.  With the middle school gay guys stuff.  The Naughty Nighty Contest starts next week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay tuned for details.  And E.W.  Getting a lot of reaction today, Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sick.  Where?  Craig, Line 8, National. 
[02:15:00]  Nah.  That's disturbing.  This is obviously a very touchy subject.  One guy's really pissed off at us because he thinks we're playing fake tapes, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  He thinks we're playing fake tapes.  He says HBO would never put something like this on the air.  Wake up and smell the coffee.  It's a documentary.  I think he will tell us when it's on next.  You can see it for yourself.  You know, Bill's all upset.  As the father of a 12-year-old girl, I find the subject matter over the line. 
[02:15:30]  Plus, this fake tape is ridiculous.  HBO would never put this out.  When you guys have kids, let's see you talk like this.  You've lost a listener.  Oh, Bill.  What brand of humor do you like?  Bill.  Give me Victor Borga.  Jim, I hate to tell you, but this isn't one of those humor segments.  No.  No.  Bill is a little upset that not everything we do is humor.  A little taste of reality coming through.  It's more like a taste of reality.  Maybe we're waking up some parents. 
[02:16:00]  I don't know.  That's humor as far as I'm concerned.  I don't care what their stupid kids are doing.  It's not my problem.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Be better parents.  They're my kids.  Will from Badass Buffalo writes, Anthony, so how much lower is HBO going to sink?  What's on the table next?  Nursing home confessions or choir boy confessions?  Here's a guy checking in saying, I have an 11-year-old daughter.  If I find out she's giving hummers, there's going to be some missing kids in the neighborhood. 
[02:16:30]  See, there's somebody who would be a little proactive.  Rack some head.  Wouldn't you be proactive if you had a daughter?  No, I would never.  I would lose my effing mind.  You know something, the guy's right in one sense, and that is that we don't know what  it's like, and I thank God, I don't want a daughter.  Oh, you just know that that time is coming.  That time's coming, that knock on the door, the effing degenerate on the other side. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, man, don't hassle me.  Insert your daughter's name.  Here.  Honey, Tommy Chong's here to pick up Stacy.  Hey, man.  Hey, is your daughter home, man?  Hey, get out of here.  If you can find better, effing.  If there's grass.  We got big, small, we got old pool, young pool.  Can't say the word from dusk till dawn. 
[02:17:30]  Great.  Hey, Rich.  Yeah.  What do you have to add?  How you guys doing tonight?  Well.  You know, I was listening to the girl who called in about the wiffle ball bat.  Remember that show a while ago?  Yeah.  Which, you know, she's got some talent, I see.  But when she started talking about when she was in kindergarten.  Yeah.  Making out with a girl.  You know, I have a one-year-old son at home.  And I'm sorry, but if my son goes up before the age of like 20, I'm pulling it off.  20?  20.  20.  Dude, 20? 
[02:18:00]  13 is a little ridiculous.  No.  I was 13.  I was 13 years old.  I was playing, you know, hockey and football.  I wasn't worried about this stuff.  Yeah, but dude, kids play doctor.  I'm teasing, sir.  Kids play doctor and stuff like that.  I mean, even when I was younger, that's, you know, that was pretty common when you were  really young.  You played doctor and stuff like that.  You know, you find a girl in class and do a little show-in-show.  Yeah.  You know?  You might pull the pants down.  Show heinies.  Yeah, sure. 
[02:18:30]  I realized I loved asses at that age.  I'm telling you.  A girl took me in the woods.  I was in second grade.  She was in third.  No one's surprised.  But I mean, it's not uncommon.  You don't have to work it, trust me.  It might not be uncommon.  Well, I tell you, it's a horrifying thought.  God forbid I have a girl.  And the shallow grave's still there, Norton?  No.  I didn't.  I was too young.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  Shy little fella.  Shy little fella.  Let me go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Hey.  First time call, long time listener.  Quack, quack.  Listen, I want to know, these guys from HBO, how do they confront these kids? 
[02:19:00]  I mean, with a camera, what do you do?  Well, they obviously got...  What do you think about a BJ?  No.  Well, they...  Well, first of all, they're going to dump out of that.  Are they?  Yeah.  I like that word.  First of all, they're getting the parents to write off on this.  I mean, what parent in their right mind would do that?  None.  There's no way a documentary crew can just go to a middle school and say, hey, we're going  to ask these type of questions without getting the parents involved and having the parents, 
[02:19:30]  you know, sign away their rights.  Yep.  Before they showed them what the kids said, I bet they signed.  Unreal.  And another thing, I mean, I'm like 27 years old.  Where were these girls when I was growing up?  That's what...  I mean, really.  That's what everyone's saying.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take it easy, man.  Bye.  Hey, guys.  It'll be on HBO Family East and West.  It's on the...  HBO Family?  HBO Family.  Holy ass.  HBO Family.  It's a teaching tool. 
[02:20:00]  Right.  It's like Scared Straight.  It's going to be on January 21st, 1255 a.m.  You guys can look this stuff up yourself.  Yeah, you don't have to convince Bill that it's real tape.  Too bad.  There's like 10 more showings.  10 more.  Are you serious?  What?  For us slow people out there over the age of 30, can you please explain, as only you  can, what digits mean?  Are you kidding me?  God.  Jay, are you insane? 
[02:20:30]  You can't figure out what digits mean?  It's pretty self-explanatory.  A digit is your finger.  Yeah.  You have 10 of them.  Make a fist and punch yourself in the head.  Some people.  All right, Rick.  Let's move on.  He's got 10 on one hand.  He's a freak.  We've got to get through the rest of these clips.  Yeah, let's...  We're running out of time.  This is...  These are kids talking about being gay in middle school.  Ah, the gay clip.  There was one guy. 
[02:21:00]  Just when your parents out there thought it couldn't get any worse.  Here you go.  I felt bad for the guy.  You know, and it's fine.  We joke a lot about the whole gay thing on this program.  We've been accused of many things.  But the truth of the matter is, the kid's gay.  It's got to be rough for the kid, first of all.  And it's...  Regardless of how much love the parent has for the kid, it's rough for the parent.  You know, you're a guy. 
[02:21:30]  They have a picture of this kid and his father.  It's Shea, I guess.  It's a Met fan.  You have dreams of your kid becoming a sports star or something like that.  He could still be a sports star.  Yeah, but you know something?  Figure skater.  It's probably not going to happen.  Yeah, figure skater.  There you go.  There are gay guys in every professional sport out there.  I understand that.  You know what I'm getting at.  It's just disappointing as a parent to know that your son is hobbing a knob.  Sorry.  That's pretty much it. 
[02:22:00]  You know, you want to picture your son going to the prom with a beautiful gal.  You don't want to have them.  Your son's going to a prom with a guy named Doug.  Right.  Doug's coming over and pinning the corsage on your son's chest.  Oh, God.  On your son's meaty chest.  On your son's meaty chest.  Bye, kids.  Have fun.  Lending in the car so him and Steve can go parking.  Get in that limo.  Oh, please.  Well, here's the following.  Your son comes home.  You turn on a black light.  It looks like an explosion at Peter Max's house. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my God.  He's always got black eyes because the boys catch him peeking in the locker room.  And the kids aren't very sensitive to gay kids in school.  No.  Know what I mean?  This is the father's reaction we got queued up.  Oh.  The exact clip you were talking about.  We do?  Oh, no.  The father's reaction.  Oh, no.  All right.  We're short.  Here we go.  When he first had come out to me, first thing I did was what any husband does in the world, 
[02:23:00]  go to their wife and say, okay, what now?  I know plenty of gay people.  And I don't classify them as this is my gay friend, that's my gay sister.  They're just friends.  Oh, yeah.  Well, this one might be gay.  And that was it.  I don't care.  You know.  But all of a sudden, now it's my son.  Now that bothered the hell out of me.  Why is it it's okay for everybody in the world, but my son?  Oh, not my boy.  Well, because it's your boy.  Because now you're getting those images in your head. 
[02:23:30]  It's fine when it's somebody else.  But the second you have the image of your son doing that stuff, it might be a little disheartening.  Because you'd be watching a porno thinking my kid would whack his bag watching this thinking of being in the other position.  Right.  You don't want to think that as a parent.  How could I ever talk to my son about lesbians?  And his family functions, he's bringing the guy over.  Oh, not the guy.  This is my roommate. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Right.  This is my friend.  You know something?  There was...  And as the years go by, he breaks up with the friends, he brings another guy.  Whatever happened to Trevor?  I liked him.  There was a gay guy in our family on my father's side, and the mother just never wanted to accept it.  And any time we would go over there for a Christmas function and all the relatives around, she would be like,  this is Anthony and his friend, his good friend. 
[02:24:30]  Like he's just bringing a pal over the house every Christmas.  No girlfriend, no nothing.  Just a friend.  Never accept the fact that later on in the evening...  Yeah.  You know what's going on with his pal?  Why?  Anthony?  Yeah.  I got another clip of a father reacting to the whole thing.  We found out, okay?  Okay.  Have you ever done anything in your long and storied career that you consider specifically to be in bad taste?  Did you look back on it? 
[02:25:00]  Maybe at the time you thought it was a good play, but you look back on it and you think that was in bad taste.  Well, sometimes, like in stand-up, I'll do jokes that are...  Like one time I was doing this thing in San Francisco and they were all gay people in the audience, they told me.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to me.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade and I saw in it there were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said, 
[02:25:30]  We are proud of our gay son.  You know?  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know, because it's not an achievement, you know?  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I just, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men are actually bragging, you know, at work like they're,  Hey, Bill, you know, my kid, oh my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean? 
[02:26:00]  And now he's articling over at a law firm and, oh yeah, he loves s**t.  He can't get enough s**t in his mouth, his ass, his kids always talk.  I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's s**t.  I want to turn to him.  God damn. 
[02:26:30]  Takes him forever, but man, it's worth the trip.  Articling over at a, yeah, yeah.  I'm very proud of the boy.  Hey, you want to make out?  More clips from Middle School Confessions.  Yeah.  The show that was on HBO, another clip about, um, um, a gay, about a, yeah, gay people, yeah.  This is the son of the father that had the reaction?  All right.  I knew since, like, last year.  That's a boy.  Because I would look at a guy and I'd be like, he's pretty cute, but I wouldn't have any feelings for a girl. 
[02:27:00]  All right, am I just going crazy?  Or, I don't really like this.  Okay, terrific.  Wow.  Uh, Maria, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  I've been biting my tongue on the bus for, like, an hour waiting to get in my car and call you guys.  Norton, my apologies, but what these kids are doing is totally wrong.  No, I agree. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, yeah?  I mean, yeah, no, it's horrible, but moreover, I'm, I'm, well, these kids, I don't think they can, they feel like they can be honest with their parents, in other words.  Like, in my house, with my parents, we were always completely, well, not 100%, but, you know, relatively honest.  Like, my parents knew what was going on in my life.  This was unheard of.  This is absurd.  It's disgusting.  I used to babysit for this girl.  Well, she won't tell me a single thing about what she's doing in high school, because she's afraid that I'm going to go back to her mom and tell her what's going on. 
[02:28:00]  You're a rat.  Exactly.  Smart girl.  No, well, I'm, I'm not.  But, anyway.  Well, it's happening, so.  It's, it's awful.  I hope I never have children.  All right, man.  Anyway.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  I think the gay kids are pretty honest with their parents.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's another, uh, gay kid.  Something tells me you've got to get that out of the way pretty early.  The second you realize that you're a gay guy, you know, even if you're a middle school or something, you better get that, uh, smooth over with the parents right away. 
[02:28:30]  You know, before they catch you.  If that's got to, you know, imagine the guy that went to the car and saw his son having sex with a girl.  If all of a sudden, you know, hey, Johnny, what are you doing in the car with my boy?  You know, guy gets up and it's, uh, another guy.  Ooh.  That's worse than just hearing it.  That's a lot of denial.  Well, listen, well, uh, I don't know who you are and what you've done with my son, but get out of my car.  What happened there?  Well, let's check out another clip.  All right.  Gay middle schooler.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Dude, you get your nails done.  Oh, my goodness.  No.  I am.  I'm feminine.  I'm very feminine.  I'll admit it.  I don't care about it.  I'm feminine.  He's feminine.  I think he's coming in Friday from Philly.  From Philly, isn't he?  Nice call back.  All right, well.  What?  Same kid.  Same kid.  I want to tell my father everything, right?  I do, because I lost my virginity at the age of 13.  Okay?  Damn. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, I want to tell my father everything, like, yeah, I lost my virginity to this guy.  He looked good.  He's like, what?  What?  He'll drag me out the house.  We'll go into the clinic like that.  Like, that's not going to happen.  Well, he knows now.  Lost his virginity.  Does he mean pitching or catching?  What do you think?  Well, you know the dads and the daughters now are at least going, well, at least the kid's on the fag.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  Now, look at the upside.  And here's the lesbian chick from middle school.  The one that looks like a small version of Stalker Patty.  This was a little, like, one of those little wiry, red-haired glasses girls that you would just write off as a library nerd kid.  Looked a lot younger than the rest of them.  And it turns out she knows already she likes girls.  It's really hard to be alone in middle school if you're gay because, like, I was alone in sixth grade. 
[02:30:30]  I had no idea that, like, there was anyone else out there who was just like me.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na.  When it's time to be gay.  She's going to grow up and look like Velma from Scooby.  Scooby-Doo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  What are you laughing at?  How you doing, man?  I got both hands on the steering wheel here. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  I got a nine-year-old boy and I got a 12-year-old girl.  Could you imagine the parties they're going to have?  You have a 12-year-old daughter.  Yeah.  So, what do you, do you pay attention to what she's doing?  Do you know?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  We got a boyfriend, Mauricio.  What?  And she wants to, you know, email this kid all the time.  And I'm saying, you know, no way.  No way.  A boyfriend at 12 there and you're fine with that?  No, man.  I don't know. 
[02:31:30]  I don't know.  I'm up for this, man.  Oh, boy.  And then, and my son.  My son, check this out.  He's in the school.  Yeah.  He's one of six boys out of 14 girls.  What do you think of the odds there are?  There you go.  All right, Joe.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot, man.  Joe's giddy over the subject today.  Yeah, Joe seems to find some humor in it.  Robin, what's up?  From D.C.  Hi, I was just wanting to respond about the little girls being gay.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  My daughter's 10 and she has a little girl that's in her class that's pretty much told her that she's in love with her and plays with her hair.  And my daughter doesn't know what to do.  She tells her to leave her alone.  But the little girls pretty much got it in her head that Courtney is her girlfriend.  Oh, my God.  How does that make you feel?  What do you do?  I just keep telling her to tell the little girl that she's not interested, that she likes boys. 
[02:32:30]  And so I don't know.  I don't know what else to do.  Wow.  I didn't know that in elementary school, this is elementary school, that little girls knew that they liked other little girls.  My daughter doesn't even think about little boys right now.  I mean, she's a kid.  Right.  Just a kid.  Sure.  Yeah.  Miss, couldn't you go to the principal or something if she's bugging her? 
[02:33:00]  I thought about doing that, but I thought kids will be kids, and as long as Courtney keeps pushing her away.  That's a touchy situation, though.  You don't want to F the other kid up for the rest of her life by, you know, oh, my God, what are you doing?  Don't talk to girls, blah, blah, blah, you know?  And then they're all twisted.  And now listening to the tapes, I'm going to have to start watching her.  She'll be 11 soon, and I'm thinking, and I have two daughters, in fact, so I'm a little bit worried about both of them. 
[02:33:30]  There you go.  Good luck to you.  All right, Robin.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  You can hear it in the parents' voices today, huh?  Oh, a lot of these parents.  Joe, before that was laughing.  Yeah, but these are fake tapes, Ant.  They're fake tapes, sure.  Joe, before that was laughing, he emailed quickly.  He wants to clear things up.  He's giggling and laughing because that's the effects of carbon monoxide in a closed garage.  He's kind of, you go through that phase right before you die. 
[02:34:00]  Jim, what's going on?  Oh, my goodness.  What are you guys doing?  What's the matter?  I have four girls.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You should quit your job today.  Thanks a lot for the show.  I've got a 12- and a 10-year-old.  Oh, boy.  Well, what do you think, man?  Well, I don't know.  I'm driving.  I don't know if I'm going to go home now.  Do you keep an eye on them?  Do you know what they're doing?  I'm going to know more now.  I've got a 10-year-old who has this little boyfriend from next door. 
[02:34:30]  Uh-huh.  And he's 9 or 10.  He's not coming over anymore.  Do you make sure they're not alone in rooms and stuff like that?  They have been.  Oh, boy.  Let me tell you, things go on when that happens.  Yeah, I know.  Now I know.  Does she have a computer with an email account and one of them?  No, no, no.  The computer's down in the family room.  They can't hear that.  Oh, there you go.  No, I keep an eye on that, but all of that's going to change.  I don't know what to do.  You guys... 
[02:35:00]  Well, we didn't mean to depress everyone today.  Yeah.  You got a minivan and a lake?  Yeah.  Well, I live near a lake.  I'm thinking about just dropping into it and drowning myself.  There you go.  All right, Jim.  Whatever works.  Thanks for calling, man.  Full bathtub.  Whatever it takes.  That Andrea Yates, what a card.  A lot of people are saying what Bill wants to say here.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, I'm kind of curious.  I'm 26 years old right now.  And about 13, 14 years ago when I was 12, 13, I had no idea what a homosexual was. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Where the hell did these kids get the idea of homosexuality?  What is going on?  And currently, where do they know?  At 12 years old, if someone was gay, it just meant they were gay.  It wasn't homosexual.  It was, don't be a faggot.  Don't be gay.  That's so gay.  You know, you threw the word around when the kid was being a dick or something, you know?  Well, look at this.  Ah, faggot, don't be gay.  Two years before you hit puberty, all you did was hang out with boys.  You didn't even know what a girl was at that time. 
[02:36:00]  What happened with that one-year period?  Some of those boys liked being with the boys a little more than you did.  Those are the boys who didn't want to leave the party.  Right.  Was it the touch football?  Did they take it a little too seriously?  Well, who knows?  It's true.  All right, Bill.  Kind of odd.  Thank you, Bill.  Very touchy.  You're supposed to put the little flag in your belt, not tie it around your helmet, Scott.  T-Bags.  Yo.  T-Bags.  Yes, yes, sir.  Yeah.  What's up, T?  Yo, how much do you think these parents got paid? 
[02:36:30]  I don't know.  These are pimp parents.  They just pimped them to HBO.  Hey, you know something?  If they did get any money for this, it is pimping.  They're pimping out their kids talking about sex in a titillating way.  It's only going to get worse for these kids now, man.  Of course it is.  Well, doggie.  How can they show their faces in school?  Yeah.  How can the parents show their faces at their workplace?  Did he just do a well doggie for no apparent reason?  By the way, Anthony, it is 2002.  We need a brand new well doggie.  Can we do that? 
[02:37:00]  Can we call up Buddy Epson maybe tomorrow?  Yeah, we'll try to do that.  We should take a break.  All righty.  And then what did we learn?  Sure, we can do that.  Adam Farrar on the job tonight, Anthony.  The jab.  On ABC 930.  Thank you.  Love the show.  Don't even need a plug.  We need a plug because of the West Wing angle, unfortunately.

Yeah.  It was rough.  He was real close with Ted Demme.  Did a lot with Ted Demme.  The ref.  Blow.  Blow.  He did his HBO specials.  Both his specials.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  What?  Mike.  Yo, Ana.  What's up, man?  I learned today that Anthony likes to play with a stinky in the back. 
[02:39:00]  Yes, I play with stinky in the back.  Oh, that's what I talk about.  Oh.  All right.  There's Mike.  Vanjie.  Yes, hey, guys.  Happy New Year.  Hey.  What's up, Vanjie?  Listen, I learned that I didn't have to go through middle school being called a skank  if I had to play my talent of being able to put my legs behind my head and hummed on  other things aside from lollipops and popsicles.  Oh, yeah?  You were able to do that?  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  I took dancing lessons starting at the age of seven.  Hey, Vanjie, is that when you started smoking three packs today?  I was going to say, you don't have the heat.  I have a cold, guys.  Oh, it's just a cold.  All right.  I didn't think they taught that at the Alvin Ailey Dance School.  No?  No.  All right, Vanjie.  All right, take care.  Save your voice, all right?  All right, later.  All right, peace.  Let's go to Edwin.  Edwin!  Yo.  What's up, man?  What's going on?  I learned what digitize the girl means.  Exactly.  She has been digitized. 
[02:40:00]  There was a few 30-year-olds that didn't know what that was.  I also learned Norton's going to be at the Stress Factory.  This weekend.  Oh.  Norton rules.  Thanks for doing the devil's bidding.  The only hope we have is that they'll sell out soon so we don't have to worry about it.  No, please.  Buy the tickets.  Let's go find listeners.  Help us out, guys.  Little John.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I learned that Anthony should be Secretary of Defense.  That's right.  Rudy said that.  And I'm in my car right now. 
[02:40:30]  If women and children get in the way, they're dead.  Norton, you rule.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Will, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I learned three things.  I learned that everything is done at night, so you don't know who you kill.  A stapler can become a contraceptive.  And that voice from the future still blows.  Very good.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  All right.  You're good.  A few coming off the instant feedback.  Jerry from Edison, New Jersey.  I learned the humor of ass cancer is in the delivery. 
[02:41:00]  Junk in the trunk more gooder than junk in the front.  And Norton used to scrap at lunch.  Scrap.  Jersey Gary from Oz.  I learned today to never let your 12-year-old appear on an HBO special.  Opie thinks he's sporting a foster.  Ant is more dinty more.  And wants stinky up his dad's beer beer.  Stinky rules, but Rudy kicks ass.  He also learned more gooder ratings get you a visit from Rich Voss.  And then he writes, isn't that like giving the winner of a contest a one-week trip to Asbury Park 
[02:41:30]  and the runner-up a two-week trip?  Stinky graduated from attending a gay middle school to bunking with a kid toucher.  Way to go, Stinky.  What's next?  Hanging with gay Marco at the Pete Town Pizzeria?  That's a good pizzeria.  That's some good callbacks right there.  And he also learned, just because Opie sang in a Bye Bye Birdie musical,  doesn't mean he's gay.  Yeah, right, faggot.  Biggie.  Big Al writes, I learned today, Norton loves military men.  Fathers are driving home with both hands over their ears yelling, no! 
[02:42:00]  And ratings.  He learned about the ratings today, Anthony.  Okay.  New York is gooder.  Buffalo is more gooder.  Cleveland, much more gooder.  Yes.  Sheep lover.  I learned today, reverb is responsible.  Sheep lover again, I learned women and children get in the way, if women and children get  in the way, they die.  Also, Opie can't be black.  And Chubby Fag from Jersey wrote, I learned that Rudy was in the Battle of Lake Placid. 
[02:42:30]  Opie is painfully white.  That was the quote.  Painfully white.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, let's go to Jake.  Jake, what did you learn today?  I learned that even after you, Stephen Ellis, Sky, Voss, still not funny.  Wow, that's good.  Andy, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that from Norton, oral treats are much better if you have a big back. 
[02:43:00]  Then you got a lost man breath off your junk.  Calling from Clumps, man, you guys rock.  Oh, thank you.  I learned the term scrap.  Scrap.  Yeah.  It sounds like you're wrestling with it.  I went home.  I don't teach you to behave.  Went home and scrap.  Scrap.  Oscar.  Yo.  Hey.  What's going on?  What up?  Today I learned from Rudy that we still call them queers.  And I also learned that at this rate, when there are boys and girls in the mother's womb, 
[02:43:30]  they're probably going to be fooling around.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, let's go to Anthony.  Anthony, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that if you give a 12-year-old boy a Hummer, he's going to stand there like a puppy  until you give him some more.  One more thing, guys.  Yeah.  My friend's nephew, he's 13 years old.  He tells us about how he bangs girls, plants his seed, smokes pot, and he writes rap songs about it.  Great.  That's...  13 years old.  That's fantastic. 
[02:44:00]  Thank you, Anthony.  Too bad for him.  Thank you, ladies.  All right.  Steve, what's going on?  How are we doing, guys?  Good.  Today I learned that Martin Sheen, even though he's the president, still thinks we're in Vietnam.  I learned that I grew up way too soon, and my daughter's never going to be older than 11.  There you go.  Thank you.  And I got a question for Adam, too.  Yeah.  Hey, is the job about middle school?  The job.  The job.  Have you ever seen The Job, Steve? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, I have.  I love the show.  The ratings would increase if it were about middle school, and you know what's up.  All right.  Thank you.  In ABC's infinite wisdom, they decided to take one of the hottest shows...  That has a buzz.  ...when it debuted.  How long ago now?  We were on the end of last year with mid-season.  The end of last year, yeah.  Six episodes?  It did six, yeah.  And it did very well.  Critics loved it, and the people loved it, and decided to, for some reason, not to put 
[02:45:00]  on another episode for a year.  Yeah.  We're going to hold off and plug the chair.  Yeah.  Great.  Great.  But now you're on.  Now we're back tonight.  Yeah.  Very funny show.  Then we should get out of here.  Yeah.  Let us go.  Let's rock.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  We had fun today.  Yeah.  It was interesting, to say the least.  We're going to leave you with Pablo Francisco.  You know Pablo?  Yeah.  I know Pablo.  He's fun.  He came in here a week and a half ago and killed us.  Bing, bing, bing, bing.  Yeah.  He was great. 
[02:45:30]  This is the tortilla boy.  I'm going to pick you up tomorrow, Jim.  We'll go to middle school.  Are we still on?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We are on.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Here they come, all together from Disney Pictures.  Oh, yeah.  Then it can be like, you know, in the city.  You must fight to survive.  He saw tortillas on the corner, and the mob wanted him.  I don't know who this guy is, but when him and his tortillas, dead.  He had one chance, and his chance was to fight back Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
[02:46:00]  Listen to me.  These tortillas, you have to get out of here.  They're trying to kill you.  Get out.  Get out.  Little tortilla boy.  And sirens are coming everywhere.
