<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous, albeit morbid, hypothetical scenario depicting Opie and Anthony's deaths in a hotel room roof collapse during a sexual encounter.  With Opie and Anthony absent, Sam Roberts and Jim Florentine took over hosting duties.  They discussed the arrest of the man responsible for the 1991 murder of "Baby Hope," expressing outrage at the killer and the victim's mother.  The conversation shifted to the justice system's perceived failings in punishing child molesters and murderers.  This led to a discussion of a coworker's viral twerking video, followed by a critical assessment of Tony Romo's performance as Dallas Cowboys quarterback, comparing him unfavorably to Eli Manning.  The hosts also debated NFL rule changes, fantasy football, and baseball managerial decisions.

A significant portion detailed Sam's experience with HGH as a child to treat growth deficiency, including graphic details about his pre-pubescent body and circumcision. Jim Florentine then shared a story about preserving his son's foreskin, prompting further discussion of circumcision. The segment concluded with comments on veterans protesting the government shutdown and the closure of war memorials.

The show then addressed the government shutdown, focusing on its impact on veterans' memorials and delayed death benefits.  The hosts expressed anger at these issues and transitioned into a discussion of their preference for movies with unhappy or tragic endings, analyzing films like *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest*, *Scarface*, *The Cooler*, *Gravity*, and *True Romance*, with a particular focus on *Scarface*.  Their distaste for romantic comedies and experiences with dates who preferred them were also shared.

Henry Bushkin, Johnny Carson's lawyer, was then interviewed. Bushkin discussed his book about his experiences with Carson, detailing their initial meeting involving an investigation into Carson's wife's alleged affair with Frank Gifford, confirming his presence at the apartment and describing the evidence found.  He recounted anecdotes about Carson's personality, including his use of a pistol, alcoholism, and relationships with his wife and mother. He also detailed high-paying Vegas gigs, interactions with Wayne Newton, and a mob threat.  Bushkin shared insights into Carson's relationships and his final interaction with the late host.  The hosts then promoted their own projects.

A subsequent conversation with an unnamed author (implied to be another Johnny Carson biographer) covered Carson's marriages, especially the costly divorce from his third wife, Joanna, and a professional falling out over the sale of Carson Productions.  This transitioned into a highly explicit discussion with Tom Arnold, filled with profanity and graphic details about sex, masturbation, bodily functions, and Arnold's experiences with cocaine addiction and its effects on his sex life.  Arnold also promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.

Tom Arnold’s interview continued, promoting his movie "Jewtopia" and discussing his sobriety journey, including a relapse and recovery from opioid addiction following a motorcycle accident.  He described his health struggles, financial misfortunes of Len Dykstra and Curt Schilling, and shared anecdotes from appearances with Schilling on Conan O'Brien's show and John Kruk on a sports show.  The discussion touched upon Schilling's political views and the irony of receiving government subsidies. They also discussed the careers and personal lives of various baseball players, including details about John Kruk's cancer diagnosis. Jim Florentine joined, promoting his shows and podcast, with the conversation remaining vulgar and sexually explicit, including speculation about Opie and Anthony’s sexual practices and the fictional roof collapse incident, followed by a discussion about Eric's experiences at New York Comic Con.

The show concluded with a listener call about a father attending Comic-Con alone, sparking debate about good parenting. Callers offered varying perspectives, including anecdotes about similar scenarios involving sports events.  The discussion touched upon Tom Arnold's past comments about eating assholes and Sam's personal life, upcoming YouTube videos from his Comic-Con interviews (Pete Holmes, Method Man, Bobby Moynihan, and Dan Harmon), and his plans for raising a pro-wrestling fan.  The segment ended with a promotion for Russell Peters' Netflix special, "Notorious."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't know how to handle the pressure of the music starting.  You feel it? That's when you feel it?  I'm so used to other people doing it.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But, uh, what do we call it when it's just us? 
[00:01:30]  Uh, Norton and Friends, isn't it?  No, Norton and Friends, of course.  The season with Opie and Anthony here, it's Norton and Friends.  The Morning Jam.  Morning Jam with Jim and Sam.  Um, uh, I think Ant wasn't feeling well.  And like, like, Sunday morning or whatever, he said he wasn't going to take a day on Monday.  And, um, Opie's got both of his kids, I think, are sick.  I'm guessing the flu.  Oh.  I don't know.  I'm just, you know, he said he's got two sick kids.  So I'm just saying, what else would they have?  Yeah.  It's flu season.  So he probably said, fuck it, let me just take a day and deal with that. 
[00:02:00]  And I was going to take a day, and I know the staff probably wants to stab me.  Yeah.  But I'm like, you know what?  Uh, we have, uh, Henry Bushkin booked today, and I really want to talk to this guy who was  Johnny Carson's lawyer for 20 years and his closest confidant.  And I read his book.  I finished his book.  So I feel like talking to him.  It will be a good interview.  I hope so.  You don't know, you don't meet that many people who were that close with somebody like Carson.  You mean, almost nobody really knew him.  Like, even, just, we'll talk to him about it, but I read the Joan Rivers part when her 
[00:02:30]  and Johnny were just, you know, Johnny severed the relationship instantly.  Like, she wouldn't even talk to him off air.  You know, very few people talk to him off air.  I mean, even Ed McMahon would go out with him once in a while.  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe in the old days.  But after a while, no one got near him.  No one.  He just, he was not social at all.  Um, you know, he didn't go to Hollywood parties.  He was just a real fucking, kind of a, uh, distance himself from all that.  So this guy really knew him well.  And why did he distance himself, though? 
[00:03:00]  I don't know.  He's just a weird guy.  He's just too big.  I guess he became bigger than anybody, right?  Yeah.  They, they, he tells, Bushkin tells a story in the book about when he realized how famous  Carson was when he was at a party, like an A-list party that he was allowed in because  he was Johnny's lawyer.  And it was, you know, Sean Connery and Gregory, like those type of people.  And the, the, all they was, were kind of waiting for was Carson to show up.  And then when he showed up, just how much he hated it.  And he couldn't stand being around these people.  And he just wanted to get the fuck out of there.  Wow. 
[00:03:30]  And there's a, he, he hosted the inauguration, Reagan's inauguration, uh, party at the request  of Sinatra.  And he didn't want to do it.  He was trying to get out of it.  He's like, uh, cause Sinatra asked him, he kind of, he loved Frank and he said, all right.  It was the president's inauguration.  It was Reagan's inauguration.  Yeah.  But he didn't, he knew him for years and he was just completely, he didn't give a fuck  and he didn't go to the inauguration.  He did the event, but the actual swearing in, he's at the crowds, fuck it.  Wow.  Yeah.  So he's just, he had this amazing above it all. 
[00:04:00]  Did he enjoy doing his show until the end or at some point did he even, I don't know.  I'm going to guess he did.  I'm going to guess he enjoyed that part of it.  Like that was it.  He's just there to do the show and then go home with the three people that he knows or  whatever.  Yeah.  Well, he said, I was surprised to see he did dates in Vegas all through the seventies up  until like the, uh, up till 1980.  He did standup dates and loved getting away from the show.  And I guess what's when he would bang chicks on the road.  Apparently he was real pussy hound.  Yeah.  Carson.  Yeah.  But, but quiet about it. 
[00:04:30]  Not like, you know, there was no TMZ back then.  Right.  But, but you know, TMZ existed then.  And Johnny, I think stuck his dick in a lot of people.  He had that original letter in bedroom above the, above the studio.  Yeah.  He probably fucked him on the set.  I mean, God, just seemed, he seemed kind of, uh, but back then nobody would have said  anything.  It was the same thing.  It's like JFK being a pussy hound.  Nobody would say anything back then.  Nobody would want to, whatever, disrespect the legacy or the legend, or you didn't say anything  about guys like that back then.  And you were also, it was frowned on to snitch. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  You didn't want to be the tattletale.  Yeah.  Now the tattletale is rewarded.  Yeah.  You're like, you know, you get your own reality show where people are dying to talk to you  and you're lined up for interviews.  But back then, if you ratted, people were like, fuck you.  And they just kicked you out of the circle.  Harvey Levin created an empire around it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like TMZ's whole thing is like, well, what if we just try to catch people doing things?  Does TMZ even film you if you don't want to be filmed?  Like, they're really, they're not as awful as I thought they were.  Like, I think if a celebrity really doesn't want to talk to them, they might just ask you 
[00:05:30]  questions, but I don't, I don't think that they really.  Yeah, but they will use the, like if a celebrity freaks out, if somebody else's camera catches  a celebrity freaking out because they do not want to be talked to, they'll use it.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, when people were showing up at Kanye West's house at four o'clock in  the morning, they might not have been TMZ camera people, but TMZ had the footage up  on the site right away.  Um, why were they showing up at his house at four o'clock in the morning?  I think just to get him upset.  Everybody wants, you know, because Kanye is known for getting upset with paparazzi, so 
[00:06:00]  they're figuring he's leaving his house at four o'clock in the morning.  They were in his driveway.  Yeah.  And it's 4 a.m.  And he's trying to put shit in his car or whatever.  And so, yeah, but maybe it wasn't TMZ's camera, but they had it on their site.  Wait, is that why he was leaving at four in the morning or is he doing something?  I don't know what he was doing.  No, he wasn't doing it.  You know, he was, he was yelling at the paparazzi to leave him alone.  Yeah, I guess he's right.  Yeah.  I don't love Kanye, but at four in the morning is a little much.  It's one thing when you're going to a restaurant that's known for famous people, but it's another 
[00:06:30]  thing when you're trying to leave your house at four o'clock in the morning.  They have that law they passed now where celebrity kids can't, uh, be like paparazzi can't stalk  them or whatever.  I don't know what the law is or I wish we, I have no idea what exactly it says, but apparently  if you're like, fuck, you got a famous person with a kid, they can't follow your kid or something.  It makes sense that they can't follow the kid.  I mean, there are, it gets complicated because there are so many celebrities that set it up  themselves and are just trying to get photos with them and their kids. 
[00:07:00]  But then there's this whole other thing of people trying to bring their kids to school  or whatever, you know, there's the Perez Hilton.  Remember he had a thing like a couple of years ago before he decided he wasn't going to be  a bully anymore, uh, that he was like, he had whole reports about Adam Sandler's kid being  ugly.  Oh really?  Yeah.  And it was like, Adam Sandler was like, well, like what the, my kid didn't choose this lifestyle.  You know, it's one thing to say I'm a public person, but I get the kid thing.  What do you think?  Um, I under, the paparazzi are so hateable. 
[00:07:30]  Anything that hinders what they do.  You like it.  Oh yeah.  And yeah, like literally if they said, if you're too aggressive as a paparazzi, the  celebrity is allowed to shoot you.  I'd probably be for it.  Yeah.  Just cause they're so awful and there's such vultures, but you know, it's like as much  as it's easy to trash the paparazzi, they don't buy the magazines.  The rest of us do.  Right.  You know, culturally we really are kind of shitty and we always find these other people  to blame, whether it's the paparazzi or, uh, yeah, but I guess we're the ones rewarding 
[00:08:00]  the tattletales by being like, did you see this video?  Absolutely.  You know, did you read about this?  Yeah.  They don't, they don't click 8 million times on it.  You know, they, if they put it up there and it got 40 views or it got, you know, it made  all no money cause people weren't interested in that shit, they would stop doing it.  Or they all, or people all said, this is wrong and all backlashed against it.  Right.  Any of those things.  Yeah.  None of that ever happens.  Never.  And I guess then you could say, well, we're just naturally curious. 
[00:08:30]  I mean, I don't know.  I guess.  And you're right.  I mean, they're like the one or two people we know from TMZ, like the guy who's out,  who stands outside this building from TMZ.  He's awesome.  Like he's a, he's a very cool dude and he films people who are coming in to do press.  And if they say, I don't want to be filmed, he doesn't bother people.  But then there's the whole other, I don't know who they work for, you know, trying to  get a tape that they can sell anybody for a hundred thousand dollars because they've  got Britney Spears hitting somebody with an umbrella or something. 
[00:09:00]  I was coming out of a sushi place in LA one time and I was with my manager and with  somebody else.  And this was when, who was Lindsay Lohan's ex, uh, was it Samantha?  Yeah.  She was there with someone else.  I don't remember who it was.  Some celebrity, some, it might've been Nicole Richie or somebody, I guess they were just  eating.  Um, but my manager was like, if you got a photo of that, that's worth a lot of fucking  money at that time.  That would have been a scandalous, but it wouldn't even occur to me. 
[00:09:30]  I'm going to snap.  I mean, I would get a picture with them.  Some of a picture whore, but I'm not going to snap a picture of two people and sell it.  That, that to me is creepy.  But putting your, yourself in the photo would have devalued it immediately.  It would have put it down and devalued it completely.  Nobody wants a photo of Jim with these two.  Yeah, exactly.  We would look like, you know, fucking two lesbians and Nicole Richie.  I have an update on that child bill if you wanted to.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  The details real quick.  They, they passed it, uh, last month that you can't harass, uh, children of celebrities  with a penalty of one year in jail and fines of $10,000. 
[00:10:00]  But it's being challenged right now by the California Newspaper Publishers Association  and other media groups stating that, um, increasing all these penalties and restrictions for harassing  children because of their parents' jobs, um, could prevent them and restrict reporters  and photographers from covering the news.  Oh, you know what?  They're such cocksuckers.  Like, how would that, first of all, what, what, what's going to get into is what classifies  you as a celebrity.  Right.  I mean, there's the obvious.  And what makes this news? 
[00:10:30]  What, what, what makes it news?  Like, what type of news are you going to have to cover where the celebrities can't, like,  if, you mean tabloid shit?  Like, if Katie Holmes and, you know, Cruz go through a divorce, you, what, the fucking  post can't cover it properly without putting a camera in the kid's face?  Right.  Or are they afraid that celebrities will be able to avoid all kinds of coverage by having  their kids with them?  Maybe they're afraid they're going to loophole, um.  Yeah, it seems like they're just complaining that it's like, um, a violation of, uh, freedom 
[00:11:00]  of the press.  No, you know, the press has to have complete freedom, I guess, but they, they, they don't  realize that they've made their own misery.  Yeah.  And it's like, you're talking about freedom of the press at the expense of a person not  being able to live a life.  Right.  And there's gotta be some kind of boundary of being a human being.  And you're not reporting news.  Freedom of the press to report information.  Uh, you, you should be free from government infringement and, and from, you should be able  to talk about whatever is in the news and what's newsworthy. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Like, like not knowing what time Holly Berry's kid gets out of school.  It's not, you know, taking information away from the public.  Yeah.  So that's, uh.  Yeah, that's stated in this thing too about the paparazzi, because there's a certain  boundary of where they can be near a school.  Yeah.  And they'll wait right at that boundary for when these parents, celebrity parents come  to pick up their kids, then they start following them.  And like, if they went to a Starbucks or to the mall or anything like that, they'll follow  them from that boundary from the school to wherever they get out of the car.  Jesus.  They're being treated like pedophiles now. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It's not right.  Like, so it's, it's like, you know, people say, well, celebrities choose their life.  They do to a certain degree.  If you're on a beach and you're Katy Perry, people are going to take your picture.  Sure.  That's, and that's, but there's like, there's got to be some kind of boundary.  Yeah.  You got to be able to live.  Yeah.  You got to, you got to be able to go home and not have people camped outside your house  all day, every day.  Yeah.  It's like at some point there has to be some kind of, you, they should, if you're on,  if you're walking through LA and you're going shopping or you're eating food or you're doing 
[00:12:30]  whatever, you're in spots where celebrities always are, then yeah, of course people are  going to take your picture.  And half of them, more than half, are calling paparazzi agencies and saying, hey, this is  where I'm going to be and take my picture and everything.  But if you move out of it, like say you do what Carson did and you move away from everything  and you try to get away from all this, at a point you should be able to have, you know,  a day of privacy.  Because everything's with the technology changing and with the fact that like you can take a 
[00:13:00]  photo of one, of a person doing something and upload it and then, you know, six million  people see everything.  So instantaneous, you know, it's changing.  Everything has changed.  You kind of have to, all right, have new, new ways of looking at it.  It's not like it used to be where that, whoever that fucking one creepy paparazzi was who  was framed, Brando, I think broke his jaw.  And then he took great, he actually took some great pictures of Jackie Onassis and he would  annoy him in the street and take photos of them.  But now it's this culture of the celebrity obsession, which I certainly contribute to. 
[00:13:30]  I don't deny that.  But they can have no privacy now.  Yeah, because everybody, because being a paparazzi is so easy for people.  You go, you pay a couple hundred bucks, you get a camera or you just use your cell phone  or whatever.  And you could just be in LA.  This acting thing didn't work out.  Well, maybe I'll just chase actors around and take their photo.  Yeah.  And it's all video now because back then, back in 1975 or whatever, everybody didn't have  a video camera.  Everybody didn't have the ability to tape everything and throw questions at you.  Hey, where are you going?  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  How is that? 
[00:14:00]  You know, it just, it's got to be fucking irritating.  Yeah.  The guy's name is Ron Galella.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a really famous asshole.  Yeah.  I mean, and he, he started that whole thing, I think more than anybody.  He was, he was like the original guy, right?  Yeah.  He, well, at least he's one of the main ones being credited.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think Brando punched him in the face.  He broke him.  Yeah.  He broke his jaw in 1973.  Wasn't he with Dick Cavett when that happened?  Um, it says, June 12th, 1973, Brando broke paparazzo, Ron Galella's jaw. 
[00:14:30]  Gallo had been following Brando, who was accompanied by talk show host Dick Cavett.  Oh, okay.  You know, I, I, cause I saw Dick Cavett recently.  I did one of the last episodes of, uh, oh, John Fuglesang show on, um, what was the T,  what was the chat?  It just became Al Jazeera America.  Current.  Current TV became out and he had like a comedy, kind of like a panel show, a news show.  So, and I've done it and, uh, he was a really, he's a nice guy, Fuglesang, and he's very  liberal, but he's, you know, he lets you express your opinions on, and one of the last  episodes, uh, I was on and Dick Cavett was the guest and, uh, he was talking about that. 
[00:15:00]  I don't remember if he talked about it on air or not.  He's a weird guy, Dick Cavett.  Dick Cavett is.  Oh, he's, but he's a fucking, he's a guy like, like Mike Douglas and all those guys  when they did talk shows and none of them did it like Carson did.  They had a weird free flow to them where they weren't afraid of dead air.  I think we talked about this recently, but it was almost like, like those talks were  almost formatted like podcasts are today.  Even radio interviews aren't done like, like Dick Cavett did anymore.  You know what I mean? 
[00:15:30]  Like where it's not, everything is formatted to this short attention span.  You got to do it in six minutes and be out and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  But yeah, like Dick Cavett and those guys used to just, okay, we have Marlon Brando for an  hour.  We might just sit here and stare at each other for the first two minutes.  And yeah, and they'd be prepared.  But again, there was a lot of natural kind of ebb and flow in a conversation.  And I watched, um, I, Mike Douglas, I watched one time do a Jackson five interview and it  wasn't good because they were shy, but there was something so natural about it and something 
[00:16:00]  so real about just watching these people talk that it didn't feel fake and fucking entertainment  tonight ish.  And it was refreshing to watch.  Like, like we've already preview, we've already pre-interviewed every question here.  So we know everything's going to be a hit.  It actually seemed like, oh, I'm starting to get a feel for what these famous people  are actually like as human beings.  Yeah.  They're a little shy or, you know, they kind of, you know, the Jacksons at that time  were really young.  And I watched in kind of, I've been watching a lot of Carson footage lately, just, you know, 
[00:16:30]  because once in a while you go on YouTube and you get caught in a loop.  And I stumbled onto a Dorothy Stratton interview.  He did Johnny interviewed her.  Um, she was a family, you know, people know who she was.  She was the playboy playmate who was murdered by her husband when she was 20.  Um, star 80 was based on her and there was another, and she was, you know, from Vancouver.  She was smoking hot.  And I want to say she was playmate of the year.  I, whatever.  She was a famous playmate and Johnny had her on.  And, um, he had her on four months before she was murdered.  And it was not a great interview. 
[00:17:00]  And that's to me what was interesting about it.  Watching him talk to her cause she came out and she was, she was nice, but she was kind  of shy.  Yeah.  You know, okay.  Like it was not a masterful, there wasn't much he could get out of her.  And what was so interesting about it was the way Carson just immediately understood this  was how it was going to be.  She wasn't being a twat.  She wasn't being confrontational.  She was just a little shy.  And so that to him, the energy of the interview came way down and that's how the interview was 
[00:17:30]  meant to go.  He didn't force it.  He carried it, you know, because he was so fucking masterful.  People are talking to any, you never realized that he had prepared, you know, you just  thought that he was riffing and he was so good at that, but it felt very natural between  them, but he didn't force it and try to make it like, Hey, so, uh, right.  Like he figures out where her vibe is naturally gets down there and then they can have a conversation.  Yeah.  I would love to ask if I remember to ask, uh, um, Henry about that, because it was one of 
[00:18:00]  those weird things where I would love to know right after I'd love to have asked Carson,  how did you feel about that?  Yeah.  Like, did you sense that that was obviously you sensed it was very slow and there was  no energy there.  And, but again, there was no shitty reason.  So did he want to get out of it or was he just so comfortable he could talk to, to anybody?  Cause he seemed like he knew how to just keep it going.  If it was a little slow, he was okay with that.  Or did he go in, go off set and start throwing pictures of water around the room?  Cause he was so upset that she had nothing for him. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He could have been furious after that and just not shown it.  But four months later she was shot by her fucking husband.  Uh, the movie with Eric Roberts, Eric Roberts actually looked like the guy.  If anybody, her husband's name was Paul, uh, not probably almost said Paul in, but it  was not him.  Oh, I'm going to put a shotgun blast in you.  It would have made a lot more sense.  Yeah.  It certainly would have hated her vagina.  She just wouldn't grow a penis.  So he called Snyder, Paul Snyder.  They said he raped her and like shot her and then he killed himself. 
[00:19:00]  They said he violated the body.  Ugh.  I don't know why I'm talking about that in fucking 2013.  The Dorothy Stratton tragedy.  You want to take calls on the paparazzi thing?  Yes.  Like a real radio show?  Sure.  Uh, Doug in Syracuse.  Hi guys.  Hi Doug.  Uh, I was, thank you.  I was listening and I'm like, fuck celebrities.  I am glad the paparazzi do this to them.  I find it awesome and entertaining.  I, because they are choosing to be prostitutes out in LA, working their asses off to be famous 
[00:19:30]  so that we're paying attention to them.  Why are we mad at reporters or people who are going out making a buck?  Well, hold on.  Let me ask you a question, Doug.  Like you say something like they're prostituting themselves.  And in some cases you're right.  Like there's the, there's the, uh, the reality show people who are really devoid of most talent.  But, but you talk about an actor, like what kind of a, what, you know, do you like Sandra  Bullock?  Do you like movies?  Like we love what they do too. 
[00:20:00]  Like it's like, what about Sean Penn?  Hollywood is who you know.  Right.  It's all about.  No, it's not all about who you know.  It's part of it.  And wanting to be famous.  Yeah, but they also.  So if you want to be famous, then you want to be photographed.  And then you got to say, well, I want to live a normal life.  No, you don't.  You want to be famous.  No, they want to do it.  You're not a hundred percent right.  I understand the emotion of what you're saying, which is they signed up for fuck them.  And it's easy to take that tact against celebrities, but it's not accurate. 
[00:20:30]  And they do want to be famous.  And I think we said, if you're on the beach and people take your picture or people are going  to come up and ask for autographs, that, that does come with it.  But with the technology and this obsession with it that we've gotten, they didn't sign  up to have absolutely no private time to themselves or absolutely no time to be alone with their  children at all.  Like they signed up for fame, but they're also giving us something like a lot of them  are fucking, they're very talented.  Like I love fucking music. 
[00:21:00]  I love a lot of their movies.  It's easy to shit on them, but we also love what they do.  So it's not like they're forcing themselves down our throats.  And the difference too, is that it's, they're not just going out and being photographed.  Like these people who are photographing them are going out of their way to try to get the  celebrities upset, which will screw up their public perception, which will screw up their  job and their livelihood and everything else.  Like there's a difference between being photographed while you're walking down the street and then  being followed.  Like after you, after somebody finds out, okay, they don't want to be photographed, I'm going 
[00:21:30]  to follow them and I'm going to harass them until Marlon Brando breaks my jaw.  Right.  I have a rebuttal to that.  How many times have you guys pointed out on your show that you guys have met A-list celebrities  in your private life or on airplanes and had no paparazzi experience and just been like,  hi, I'm Jimmy Norton or hi, I'm Sam Roberts sitting with you on first class.  Well, not you, Sam, but hi, I'm Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, I'm Coach.  I'm on first class.  And I'd just like to talk with you as a human being and I'm pretty much a celebrity myself 
[00:22:00]  and like to get to know you and I go, go fuck yourself.  You know what, though?  He's a human to me.  Dude, no, no, no.  You're right and you're wrong.  You're right.  Like the Nicolas Cage story where I, you know, he wanted nothing to do with me.  Hold on.  I wasn't mad at him for that.  Like, it was almost like, who the fuck am I?  And not like, who am I, he's a big star, but he's just, in that moment, I know he's famous  and I fucking wanted to talk to him, but I, in fairness, I only wanted to talk to him because  he was Nicolas Cage.  If he was just some fat old lady, I would not have sat there and went, oh, I hope she 
[00:22:30]  takes a picture with me.  So I was treating him differently in a way.  So he had the right to react that way.  He wasn't a dick to me.  He just wanted to be left alone.  And believe me, that's coming from me, fucking picture taker.  He wasn't a dick.  That's my point, is I think you are being nicer to him in the situation because he is  famous, because you care.  It's chicken and egg logic.  No, but if he wasn't famous, like, Jim wouldn't have just started a conversation with the stranger 
[00:23:00]  next to him on the plane.  Right.  And it would have had no emotional impact on me whatsoever.  Because I wouldn't have been thinking about a photo, so I would have had no emotional impact  from this person.  I never would have thought about it.  But, dude, there have been people who have started conversations with me, and I'm pretty  friendly with fans, but I don't get bothered on the level a guy like that does.  And you know what?  There's been times where people, like, a perfect example, I'm walking yesterday from my apartment  to go somewhere, and I have my headphones on, and this guy, and this doesn't happen to 
[00:23:30]  me very often, he meant, he was like a Russian guy.  I thought I'd hear like, so I turn, and I realize there's like a handyman in the building.  He's having a cigarette, and he has been calling me.  So I stopped, and I was like, oh yeah?  And he goes, oh yeah, come here.  I'm like, what?  Because I was going somewhere.  And he goes, you got a minute?  And I'm like, no, I have to be somewhere, because I did.  And he goes, oh, I just wanted to tell you a joke.  And I'm like, what?  Like, so I'm like, I don't have time, brother.  Actually, I had to.  So he might have thought I was a dick.  If he had said to me, hey, can we take a quick photo, I would have been happy to do 
[00:24:00]  it.  But like, you don't stop somebody.  Like, I had headphones in, and I had to be somewhere.  And so he might have thought I was a dick, but I wasn't trying to be a dick.  I just had to be somewhere.  So that guy may not have a story how, fuck Jim Norton.  I tried to talk to him, and he was a dick.  And the reality.  I have another example from your own radio show.  Okay.  I think it was you guys were interviewing the singer from The Who.  Roger Daltrey, yeah.  Yes.  And with Opie, it was like, what a connection we were having. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, my God.  I think we finally have this real connection.  And then he bumped into him on the street an hour later, and he goes, who are you?  Exactly.  I understand what you mean.  That's my point.  How can anybody have sympathy for these people?  Because, dude.  Oh, my God.  They're taking photos of me.  Also, Roger Daltrey is walking down the street in New York City.  He's not being flapped by paparazzi.  There is more of a cultural issue of L.A.  What you're saying, hold on. 
[00:25:00]  One thing at a time, dude.  One thing at a time.  Like, you're talking about celebrities not remembering.  I'm the king of not getting remembered.  And that's why I don't pretend to have a bond with them.  Like, I'll take a photo with someone, and then I leave them alone.  I don't hassle them for 20 minutes and try to, like, hang out with them.  Like, if we take a photo even in studio, sometimes I see them and they remember me.  Most times they don't.  And then I realize there's been a few times, even on my much lower level, that I've talked  to people in radio shows.  I'm like, oh, my God. 
[00:25:30]  That guy interviewed me and I didn't remember him.  It's not that you don't remember him because you think you're better.  I don't forget somebody because I think I'm more important.  I'm just fucking going from interview to interview to interview, or a lot of times I'm on the  phone doing phoner to phoner to phoner.  So it all just becomes one.  You're being asked the same questions.  You're being...  It's not like every interview asks you completely original and unique questions.  You know, the second or third time somebody comes in, then they start to go, oh, okay,  yeah, I know you, but it takes a while to get on the radar of somebody who's really, really 
[00:26:00]  famous because they meet so many fucking people and so many people want something from them.  They learn to tune out.  And it's not that they're...  Mr. Bushkin, the attorney for Carson, I remember every anecdote from Carson's existence, though.  What's that?  You still expect the attorney coming in for Carson to remember every anecdote from Carson's life.  Well, he wrote a book.  They were close friends.  They were close friends, dude.  But you know what I mean?  It's like Johnny's an interesting guy because, you know, I love Johnny Carson and Bushkin... 
[00:26:30]  Thanks for the call, man.  He's just being a little...  You know, he's just being disagreeable to be disagreeable.  But Bushkin knew him, and I'm kind of curious as to, is this a betrayal because you were Johnny's  lawyer?  Yeah, and Carson was, like we were saying, a notoriously private guy.  Right.  Even if this isn't one of those, you know, scandalous tell-all books, would Carson have  wanted this much information out there?  I thought it was a fair book, to be honest, and I'll say this to him.  I thought the book was very fair.  He paints Carson to be a very complete person, a motherfucker at times, very cutting and 
[00:27:00]  harsh.  Also, a guy who had a lot of fun...  He talks about the fun times he had with Johnny, and he goes, all the people that think Johnny  was just private and didn't talk to people should have seen him in this, this, this,  this situation where he had a ball.  Yeah.  He was just very careful.  But that guy who just called in, his attitude is very typical of people, like, they do have,  like, the guy who just, I would love to ask him, I should have asked him, how do you feel  about your boss having your Facebook password?  Now, you're not a celebrity, but does he have the right to have it? 
[00:27:30]  Because things you say publicly can be a reflection of his company.  And that's that weird sort of thing that people get with celebrities where they get, I don't  know, but it's not necessarily jealousy, but the sort of, you don't deserve to have this  lifestyle that you have, so now we can treat you, we don't have to treat you like a human  being.  Right.  Like, that's, that's to me almost an aggression towards celebrities, like a dislike of them  just because of that, and some of them are fame whores, but you know what, like, fuck  it, I just, I saw, gravity's an example or whatever. 
[00:28:00]  Sandra Bullock's a fucking great actress.  She does something I'll never be able to do for as long as I live.  You know, as much as it's easy to make fun of the shitty movies, the hands thing, yes,  she made her hands look like they were floating.  If I did gravity, I would have been pop locking and fucking sitting on my hands.  Stroking your jaw with every line.  Exactly.  And pushing my fingers like I was on earth.  All right, who's on the fun?  Uh, Chris, Chris in Philly.  Hi, Chris.  Hi, guys, how's it going?  Good, how are you?  I just wanted to kind of bring up a counterpoint to what the previous caller said. 
[00:28:30]  I mean, if you think about it, we live in a country that one of our main priorities is  respecting civil liberties regardless of your social status.  Right.  So, just because they're rich and famous, like, if they're with their kids or their wife who's  out of the spotlight, they kind of deserve their privacy, like if they're out for dinner  or something like that.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I mean, I think there is definitely a lack of boundary being established. 
[00:29:00]  Like, I don't think I'm, I'm definitely not saying, and Jim, I don't think you're saying  that celebrities should not have their photos taken.  Of course not.  How could I say that?  Yes.  I want to put my fucking awful blinky face in every one of them.  Yeah, and going up to a celebrity and asking, can I take a photo with you, or taking their  photo while they're walking down the street, whatever that is, is all fine.  But when you start harassing, when you start getting their families involved, when you start  going out of your way to try to get this moment to get them upset, to get, to make them 
[00:29:30]  look bad, then that's a whole different thing.  When you start following, when you start stalking, you know, it gets, like I was in Soho one  time and I saw Seal and Heidi Klum with their children and I did not ask for a photo.  I didn't even approach them because they're with their kids.  Like even as much of a, you know, a fucking pictured jizz bag as I am, there are times,  many times that I have not approached or gone, because I don't bother people when they're  eating.  I don't, there's, I kind of understand when somebody's in a public moment or when they're 
[00:30:00]  in a private moment and I try to respect that if I can.  Although you getting in for a family photo with the Seal and Heidi Klum and the kid  and you, that would have been a good one.  Especially if I handed the camera to the kid, they were too young and they dropped it and  I screamed at them.  Pick it up!  Pick it up, but you broke it!  I tried to charge Seal or Heidi Klum for my camera, but yeah, like then I didn't, but  yeah, they have the right to certain privacy, although I don't know how much of a civil liberties  issue that is.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Uh, John.  Yo, what's up?  Sam.  What's up, man?  You can't be any more wrong with a few statements that you said. 
[00:30:30]  Jimmy, I love you, you're the best.  Thanks, buddy.  Uh, if they don't want their photo taken, there's ways around it, number one.  Number two, when they're promoting a movie and they're involved in promotion, they want  every photo of every situation, picking their nose, picking their ass, punching their driver,  whatever it is, they want to be, they want to be photographed.  Sure.  You can't have it both ways.  Yes, you can.  You cannot have it.  I disagree.  You can't, meaning...  Jimmy, you can have it both ways because she's got big tits and a cock.  That's different. 
[00:31:00]  No, dude, but seriously, I know what you're saying and I understand the emotion of, hey,  they like their picture taken, so fuck them.  But it's different than it was 20 years ago.  It's not the same world we live in.  Like, and all of you people out there notice it in the fact that, again, I raised the Facebook  question.  Everyone out there kind of feels like everybody is getting more and more invasive.  So they are just feeling it on a level that we can't even...  Yeah.  And again, dude, and I'm a guy who likes to have my picture taken.  I like to have my picture taken with them.  And I do think in public, a lot of times they ask for it and they know what they're doing. 
[00:31:30]  But there are times, like if Julia Roberts is driving her fucking three-year-old to school  and the paparazzi are fucking following her on motorcycles doing 70 miles an hour, there's  a difference.  There's a difference between that and when she's out all made up shopping by herself  with her new boyfriend.  And when Sean Penn is kicking a photographer and when Alec Baldwin is throwing a daily news  reporter, they don't want to get caught beating up a reporter. 
[00:32:00]  They're pissed off.  And the reporter played...  But, you know, we're in this world where it's instant gratification.  With the Facebook thing that you said, Jimmy, a lot of companies are telling their employees  that, look, here are the rules around what you can and cannot say.  And they have to sign some sort of a document that protects the firm.  And that's the new thing.  That's the new thing.  And that's all about lawyers and bullshit.  But the reality is, if you want to work for these large organizations, you can't be on  Facebook taking pictures of your twat. 
[00:32:30]  Well, no, no.  I understand that.  Like, I don't...  Exactly.  And that's...  But that gets into a personal privacy issue.  And that's a different issue.  But the outrage people feel over that, it's like, again, I love...  Like, I talked about loving what the NSA did, just because it gives everybody a fucking...  What it's like to be invaded.  Because we have no mercy for other people's privacy.  Like Tiger Woods' phone conversation, or Mel Gibson's phone conversations.  Is that...  Thank you for the call, man. 
[00:33:00]  I love those calls.  And they're fun to play.  We'll play them all day.  And my excuse, and my asterisk to be able to make fun of them and play them, is I reveal  a lot of myself, and I own up to the fact that, yeah, I fucking talk dirty to girls texting.  I don't pretend that I'm better than them.  And we're not exposing this thing.  It's like, once it's out there, okay, you know, we're going to jump on the pile and have  fun with it as well.  And you know what?  Honestly, even if we found those voicemails privately and realized that we could be the 
[00:33:30]  first to expose them, we definitely would.  Yeah, like on the...  We did it on the...  Who was their pet...  Anthony Weiner?  No, Anthony Weiner, or Pat, what's his name?  Oh, Pat O'Brien.  Hi, buddy.  Florentine just walked in.  We're talking about...  We're actually breaking in like two minutes.  We're talking about celebrity privacy and all the obsession with just fucking everybody  getting into celebrity's business because this...  And, you know, stalking and being followed and taking pictures of their kids and all that 
[00:34:00]  stuff.  Like, what's the balance between that and, you know, is it okay or is it not okay?  Well, yeah, you know, I've been reading the Johnny Carson stuff.  Oh, you did?  Well, in the New York Post, like, they put an excerpt in there.  But I was thinking about Ozzy, all the stuff Ozzy did when he was young, you know, in  the 70s, 80s, pissing on planes and stuff like that.  Like, he'd be a monster right now.  America would hate him.  I mean, they hated him back in the 80s because they thought he was like a devil worshiper.  But all that stuff, I mean, pissing on the Alamo, just whizzing on a plane. 
[00:34:30]  Like, there's stories of him just peeing on a plane in first class.  Someone was in the bathrooms.  He just whipped it out and pissed right on the floor.  Pissed right on the floor.  Shitting in hotel rooms, you know, like in the ice machines in hotels.  Shitting in guys' businessman's shoes.  They would leave him outside the door in a five-star hotel.  He was shitting there.  And Rudy Sarso said he would wait for the guy actually to open the door in the morning  just to see his reaction.  He'd be up all night.  He'd be like, I have to see his reaction when he goes to put his shoes on or he picks them up.  Like, and just if that stuff got out there. 
[00:35:00]  Like, you know, with TMZ following him around.  Like, just a complete monster.  Which I love that stuff.  But the stuff with, like, that type of shit is fucking, like, that's almost fair game.  Like, it's the kid stuff.  Like watching Justin Bieber piss in a restaurant bucket or whatever that was.  Yeah, like, if your friends are taking videos of you pissing in a restaurant kitchen and posting it.  It's like, because no one, his friends took that video.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it's when they're with their kids or something or they're, like, having some kind of a moment 
[00:35:30]  where it's like, you just want to be a person.  And the fucking, and the organized people who are selling their photos, they're not even fans.  They're just organized machines following you, snapping 500 pictures to sell.  That gets kind of creepy.  Or, like, following Ozzy and going, Ozzy, Ozzy, heard you're having marriage problems.  Ozzy, marriage problems.  You have marriage problems, right, Ozzy, right?  Marriage problems, right?  Until he snaps and, you know.  Now, when there's kids involved, yeah, you should just lay back.  You see Al Paul walk with his kids.  Like, just bother him when he's by himself. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  If you're going to do it.  Even though that's annoying.  Just, you know, if he's with his little kid, he just had a little baby.  And he's pushing him around a stroller.  Don't start antagonizing him with a little kid.  Yeah, say hi to him and fuck off.  And you're the perfect, too, to talk about this because nobody is as obsessed with getting  celebrity shots as you guys.  A perfect example.  I took my nephew to see this band, Five Finger Death Punch, on Saturday night.  He loves the band.  Yeah.  And he wants to get all the autographs and pictures backstage.  So whenever I bring on any show, there's never chicks backstage.  They're just never at Sabbath, at Iron Maiden, at Priest, at Motorhead. 
[00:36:30]  There's never.  There's no chicks.  Right.  There's not in a million.  Maybe the bartender in the back, doing the private part.  That's the only broad.  But so all of a sudden, for some reason, there was some chicks hanging out.  And some of the guys in the bands were talking to him.  He's like, all right, go over now.  I want to get the autograph.  I want to get the picture.  I go, Mike, he's 14.  I go, you don't understand.  There's chicks around them.  You don't go fucking near them.  We'll get them next time.  He goes, what if they don't come tour for two years?  I go, then we wait two years.  They haven't.  They've been on a tour bus for 22 hours.  They've finally seen some chicks. 
[00:37:00]  They're talking to them after a show.  Leave them alone.  I said, if we get a little break where the girl walks away, goes to the bathroom, or he does, then we can go get them.  I go, we're not going to interfere with them talking to girls.  We did it.  That's the line.  That's the border.  You've got to have your rules.  You know?  And I'm not trying.  And a fan taking a picture with somebody who you genuinely like, you're not trying to catch that person.  You're not trying to grab them in a private moment and catch them and get them.  That's the fucking mentality the paparazzi has.  They want to get you.  They want to catch you fucking up.  So, it's like I never wanted to catch, there's been things I've heard, believe it or not, I've heard a couple of celebrities say things in private or do things in private that I just wouldn't say. 
[00:37:30]  I don't have that mentality.  Like, if somebody has said something to me personally off air, I've never once come back and snitched to get a moment.  Never.  I don't do it.  It's fucking gross.  But celebrities know that people will, and that's why they can't, when they're getting followed around, they can't have a conversation anymore.  Like, now we can't talk until this guy leaves us the fuck alone, because no matter what we say, he's going to, the only reason he's here is to go try to get somebody to pay him to print it somewhere. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, there's a, there's a, there's paparazzi have gotten, and again, I know that, again, we enjoy it.  The people buy it.  It's not like they fucking force it on us if no one bought it, you know, uh, but this, it all started, you were talking about, you know, Bushkin because of the Carson book.  Like, and he was his, it's like how much of this was in, like, would Carson want to strangle him for this book?  I'm wondering.  He had, he got out of doubt it.  I mean, he's a huge control freak and everything else.  He, you know, he'd turn on you in a dime, just an angry guy. 
[00:38:30]  Absolutely.  Anyone that crossed him, look at Joan Rivers.  He never talked to her once you got that talk show, which he said, you could go ahead, go for it.  It's a good opportunity.  And then never talk to her ever again.  No, he never even spoke to her.  What happened, this, and then this was closer to the end of the book was that, uh, Joan had been on the show.  Like they knew that they were negotiating this Fox deal to start at 11 o'clock and she never mentioned it to Johnny and her husband, Edgar, uh, who was going to be the executive producer of that show, play poker with Johnny and never said a word. 
[00:39:00]  And I think Johnny found out the night before the announcement or something like, and, and, and Bushkin said that he was mad too, as the attorney.  And, uh, Johnny just was so like, fuck her.  Like she never even told me that she was, cause basically she was going to become a competitor.  And, and he said that Johnny said to him privately, like if she had come to him or just said, Hey, look, I'm going to do this out of respect because he made her Johnny would have wished her well, because he said, to be very honest, Johnny did not see her as a threat.  He didn't think she could hold the audience cause he said she's too harsh. 
[00:39:30]  Um, I don't think she can carry a show every night because she's so harsh.  So Carson wouldn't have been afraid of her.  But he was just mad that she didn't say, I'm working on this.  I'm doing this or look, they're going to announce this next month or they've offered me this.  And, and, but then again, Jones explanation was good too.  I truly think, I believe the explanation was that I think Jones husband lied to her.  I think he said that he reached out to NBC cause Edgar said to her that I reached out to NBC about your future.  And they weren't calling back. 
[00:40:00]  Johnny had re-upped for two years.  She was the permanent guest host, but she was only re-upped for one year.  So she didn't feel totally secure.  There was a list of 10 comedians slated to possibly take over for Johnny.  Like, Lana, I guess was on that list and some other people.  She was not one of the 10.  So she didn't feel totally secure.  So that made sense to why she'd want to go get her own show.  But you think that was Edgar made that up?  No, that's all the truth.  I think he made up the part about reaching out to NBC cause Huskin said there's no way he would have ignored two calls from Edgar Rosenberg.  He just wouldn't have.  So Joan thought that Edgar reached out to, Edgar said, I reached out to NBC and they never got back to us. 
[00:40:30]  That's what Joan thought.  I believe so, yeah.  Cause at that time, Henry Bush said he wished that he had, I don't know why I'm saying this now, but I just read it two days ago.  He said that he wished he would have listened to her explanation because it probably was believable.  He said there's no way that two phone calls would have gone unreturned cause they were too close.  But she would have had to call him and not Johnny.  So like, it was like one of those giant fuck ups that just everybody miscommunicated.  But I kind of saw Carson's point too in this. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  I thought that she, I thought she went to him and said, look, Fox is interested.  And he said, good luck.  And then once she got the gig, he never talked to her.  No, he just never spoke to her again because of that.  He felt that she was being disloyal.  Like you were on the show a week before or whatever.  And you don't tell me like, you know, you're planning this fucking major.  And Bushkin said the reason Carson wouldn't have cared, because they were always throwing people up against him always.  And he would have them on after, whether it was Joey Bishop or Dick Cavett or any of these guys that had done shows that failed against him. 
[00:41:30]  Johnny had them on and occasionally he would make fun of the fact that their show wasn't on.  Like, he didn't give a fuck.  He wasn't afraid of Joan Rivers.  So I'm looking forward to that.  And should we take a break or what do you do with one more call?  What do you guys think?  Yeah, let's take a break.  Oh, Sam, because our eggs are here.  Let's do another call.  Let's go to Daniel in Korea.  Hi, Daniel.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, Florentine.  Hey, Sam.  How are y'all doing?  Hi, buddy.  Hey, Jimmy.  I always wanted to call into your regular show, because I feel like my fetishes are getting weirder and weirder.  But I'll save that for a Wednesday.  Okay.  Hey, I'm wondering if you saw the interview Rolling Stone did with Artie Lang about his upcoming book that's about to come out. 
[00:42:00]  I know you've worked with him a couple times.  And I don't give a shit about Stern, but it was a real candid fucking interview about his suicide attempt and rehab and everything like that.  Opie tweeted about it yesterday.  I just didn't know if you had a chance to see it or not.  No, it's funny.  I never even read Artie's book, and I love him.  I just don't read stuff like that.  I've just gotten too mentally lazy and too distracted with pornography.  I didn't even know he did Rolling Stone. 
[00:42:30]  Well, it's an excerpt from his book that's coming out in a few weeks.  Oh, okay.  I have a feeling Artie has another number one bestseller on his hands.  It's called Crash and Burn, I think.  Yeah.  Which is, you know, everybody knows what a fucking disaster he made of things.  And he seems to be doing better now.  I'll see him at the Comedy Cellar once in a while, or I'll do his show and see him on the road.  We'll do a gig.  And, you know, it's amazing how he was so out of touch for so long, meaning you couldn't get a hold of him.  And now, you know, Artie, every time I knew he was doing better, he said to me, let's do some gigs together. 
[00:43:00]  And you did the first gig, real gig, back in Atlantic City at the Borgata when he was on that.  The Antisocial.  Antisocial, that was his first big gig in front of a crowd.  You know, a couple sets at the Comedy Cellar, that was it.  Yeah.  Before he did his first, that was a couple years ago, I remember that, yeah.  And a lot of them were Howard fans at the Borgata.  We did two shows.  And the O&A Howard mix for audiences has been great.  They've been really good to, you know, Howard fans don't yell at me and O&A fans don't yell at him. 
[00:43:30]  It's just no one gives a fuck.  But there was a lot of love from Stern fans for him.  It was almost like you could feel they had unfinished business with him.  Like, they felt their relationship with him was incomplete because one day he was just gone.  You know, he was a big part of the show and then all of a sudden gone.  So they really wanted to show up and show him a lot of love.  Yeah, because that payoff never really happened with him on the show.  Right.  So it was interesting to watch.  You know, when he was gone for basically a year and a half.  Yeah.  No one heard from him.  I never heard.  I was good friends with him.  Yeah.  I never heard from him.  Oh, wow.  I tried to get in touch with him, you know, change different numbers. 
[00:44:00]  I was in touch with contact with his sister once in a while trying to get updates.  But, you know, he basically lived at his mom's house.  Yeah.  In rehabs and then went back to his and lived in his mom's basement until he got better.  She kept him there.  Yeah.  Until he got back out.  And then all of a sudden, you know, Nick DiPaolo called him up and said, hey, you know,  you want to do a radio show with me or doing a test run?  He's like, yeah.  And they did like one show and they got offered a huge deal.  And they already was back in show business, basically.  Yeah.  And it looks like he was just ready.  But his sister, he's very close to his sister.  And that's kind of who you go through.  So I'm happy for him that he's back. 
[00:44:30]  And I know that he's sober.  He's got engaged.  He recently got engaged.  You know, so he's doing good.  His radio show is doing good.  He's out doing gigs.  And he said he's got a huge book tour coming up.  He just did Fallon last week.  He's going out to L.A. to do Kimmel and Conan and a bunch of shows.  So he's doing good.  And his show is he has me on every time I need to promote something or just to come on and hang.  It's hard because he's fucking 10 p.m. on weeknights.  It's like, you know, you'd think he'd made it a little easier for me by taking an earlier show.  Selfish already.  But, yeah. 
[00:45:00]  But the book, whenever it comes out, I'm sure I'll promote it.  So I'm very happy for him.  All right.  Thanks for taking my call, guys.  You guys rule.  Hey, shout out to Anthony.  Hope he gets out of that jail cell.  You know, all those glory holes.  Not worth it.  What's that?  But they catch it.  Anthony's got to stay away.  We heard you.  I haven't done that in a while.  See you, man.  They have Robert Show on line.  Listen to the audience.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  So I guess we'll fucking we have we have Henry here.  We have Tom Arnold. 
[00:45:30]  Tom Arnold's coming in.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  I like Tom.  I haven't seen him in a long time.  He's shared a dressing room with me when we did some Montreal fucking taping.  Really?  Years ago.  Yep.  That's just wanted to finish the break with a really uninterrupted story.  No follow up on that.  I just home run.  Yeah.  Bad story.  I met him.  I met him once at a party tomorrow.  I just said, can I get a picture?  He's like, yeah.  I'm like, thanks.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM. 
[00:46:00]  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  Go on.  Stay down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more.  Oh, we're back.  It's, uh, Opie and Anthony have, uh, both passed away.  So, um, Sam and I are now doing the show for today.  And then tomorrow, we don't know what's going to happen. 
[00:46:30]  And Jim Florentine is, of course, here.  But unfortunately, Opie and Anthony have, uh, both killed in a tragic accident.  Um, they were making love in a hotel.  Nobody knew that they had it in them.  And the roof caved in.  Wow.  That's ironic.  Yeah.  It was really, I had no idea that they were involved in a relationship.  Who would be the top?  I don't know.  I think that they would probably swap off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because Ant can get a little lazy at times.  And he'd probably want Opie to.  But then Opie just kind of likes to sit there and eat his blueberries.  So he'd want Ant to.  So I think they would just kind of go back and forth.  That's good.  Like a relationship.  Yeah.  Like a relationship.  What position do you think they'd be in? 
[00:47:00]  I think that.  Would they be like eye to eye, like on top?  And look each other in the eye.  Yeah.  I think so.  You know, if we're doing radio that long and having a good career.  I think that the way that they would make love would be one on the back with his legs  bunny-rabbited and the other one on top, like bracing with his arms, but then lowering  his arms and slowly licking the mouth at the other.  How great is it they caught this fucking piece of shit.  The guy, that baby Hope case years ago in New York in 19, what was it? 
[00:47:30]  In 91, they found some like four-year-old girl naked and like hog-tied in a refrigerator  like she had been killed and then, you know, put there.  And nobody, she was no name or anything.  And then recently they fucking, they just arrested the guy and they found out who the little girl  was.  This fucking piece of shit cousin from the Bronx.  And the mother never reported the girl missing. 
[00:48:00]  Why not?  Because the mother was an illegal immigrant who had a bunch of kids and she said she was  afraid of the father.  She's just a piece of shit.  Yeah.  And she doesn't report her daughter missing.  And it turns out that like somebody overheard recently in a laundromat, a woman overheard  someone saying like, yeah, my sister went missing years ago.  And it was just the baby Hope anniversary.  And I guess she put two and two together.  I don't know exactly how the cops came to realize that this might be the little girl's  family.  And then they did some kind of a sneaky DNA test on the mother. 
[00:48:30]  Um, this scumbag has just been like living with it forever.  But at some point he must've said, I'm getting away with this.  Like, I'm good.  I'm getting away with it.  Cause it was, what'd you say?  91?  91.  So how long do you think before he was like, okay, I'm done?  Probably five years.  Five years.  So he was never a suspect because she never reported a missing.  And no one knew the, no, no, no, no one even knew who the girl was.  She was just called baby Hope.  The cops actually bought her this headstone.  And as you can see, now there's a name on Angelica Castillo, but it was just baby Hope, 
[00:49:00]  July 23rd, 1991.  Because, uh, there was, since there was no reported missing kid, they had no idea who it  was.  So the mother never reports her missing.  It's found out recently and then through DNA, I guess they could probably track this  animal.  He wanted to, like, he was, came home drunk.  There was like 10 kids living in the house, just a fucking shitty Bronx situation.  And he said that he just wanted to rape her four years, four years old.  So he wants to fuck his four year old cousin and she screamed.  So he smothered her with a pillow and his sister, who I guess was an adult then of course, 
[00:49:30]  and is now dead, helped hide the body.  So, uh, you know, the cops were really fucking happy to get this scumbag.  So what are they going to do with the mother?  Can they put her in jail?  Are they going to deport her?  Hopefully deport her.  Probably not because she has kids here with someone.  Um, I don't.  They can't put her in jail?  Not for not reporting her kid missing.  Would she, do you think she, did she know?  No.  That he did it?  Oh, I don't know.  I have no idea.  I don't think so.  His sister knew.  But I don't know if the mother knew. 
[00:50:00]  Chances are he probably never told the mother because they were probably like, what happened?  I'm going to guess she didn't know.  If they can get her on something, they will.  Because they must hate the mother too.  If she knew and hit it, she could definitely get charged.  Oh yeah, of course.  But I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean.  What if she suspected?  If she had a feeling?  I mean, she didn't even report the kid was missing.  You don't have to report your four year old's missing?  I don't know what the law is.  I mean, that was a big thing with Casey Anthony.  I don't know what the law is.  I think they made a law now saying you have to because of Casey Anthony.  And I could be wrong.  It looks like I think they put a law in the book saying you have to make sense. 
[00:50:30]  But she said that she was afraid of being deported and she thought that the father took  her or something.  It's just that some cop was quoted anonymously as saying she's the woman's a piece of shit.  And she obviously is a fucking piece of shit.  Yeah, that's great.  I'm happy that they they fucking caught this guy.  And just knowing that he that his whole world collapsed around him in a second.  Like, oh, my God, everything just came pouring back in all.  He thought he was fine.  Yeah.  And now he's just fucked forever.  Yeah.  He'll go to jail forever. 
[00:51:00]  That's got to be a tough way to live, man, because you never know if you're going to  get busted every minute of the day.  Yeah.  You don't know if that door in the middle of the night is going to get kicked down or  you're walking down the street.  One life ruining secret that you have like forever.  Like you just live with it.  You can't talk about it.  You're petrified that people are going to find out about it at all times.  Yeah.  Rest of his life, hopefully.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  Well, you know, but they'll protect him in jail, I guess, because legally they have  to. 
[00:51:30]  But it would be nice if they just allowed the convicts to kill him.  It would be nice if we allowed convicts to beat like pedophiles and rapists to death.  Put them right in the general population.  Yeah.  Like the dude that killed Adrian Peterson's two year old kid.  The football player.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  And he played this weekend.  Yeah.  That was another one.  He had a kid with some woman.  He'd never met the kid.  I guess probably some.  I don't know if it was a girlfriend or a girl.  He just knocked up.  And of course, she was going to keep it.  But he had a two year old and the girl's boyfriend in Minnesota or something beat the  kid to death. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  She he didn't know.  Actually, yeah, they had an affair a couple of years ago.  She thought it was some other guy's kid and she got a DNA test recently and it wasn't.  And then she realized it was Adrian Peterson.  Oh, so it wasn't like he was just not seeing his kid.  Yeah.  And he just found out like three, four months ago he had the kid.  He was going to go meet him in a couple of months.  Maybe when the season was over, he was busy and stuff.  It's so but this the first time he saw him when he was when the kid was on life support  when he went to the hospital to meet him.  Yeah.  LeBron James tweeted something like hopefully the guy will get what's coming to him.  But he won't. 
[00:52:30]  They never do.  Like, you know, convicts always say they have this this code of ethics and you don't do  this and that.  But they don't you don't you don't you don't pedophiles wind up living in jail and they  don't just shank you or cut your throat like they should when you walk in.  Yeah.  I mean, David Berger, which is living like a pleasant life now in jail.  Yeah.  He wasn't a pedophile.  But still, he just went around killing girls.  I don't know if he has a if he's in general population or not.  I don't know.  The guy who shot when me and Kenny went to San Quentin, went to San Quentin.  We got a tour.  And there's a wing where Sirhan Sirhan is and Charles Manson. 
[00:53:00]  And these are guys that the other convicts simply can't get to.  But the guy who was showing us around actually had photos he showed us of a guy who had drunk  drove and killed a nine year old girl.  And I think he had a bunch of drunk driving convictions.  So he's thrown in jail for years.  And this other convict was so disgusted in the guy was doing like double or triple life in  the middle of the yard.  The guy just fucking shanked him, stabbed him in the neck and killed him for it.  And this happened like a day or two before we got there. 
[00:53:30]  So this guy was preoccupied with wrapping this case up.  And he showed us photos of the bloody scene.  And it had just happened.  It had just happened.  Yeah.  But that to me was great.  I mean, I feel bad for any alcoholic that does something, you know, because, you know,  I'd like to say, but for the grace of God, they're gone.  But especially since it had been a repeat mistake.  Like, it's not like he got drunk once and drove in this.  Oh, although there's a difference in intent behind a guy who does that and some guy that  rapes a four year old difference, but still.  But, you know, it's kind of hard to feel bad for anybody that kills a kid and doesn't. 
[00:54:00]  Definitely.  You know, whatever.  But there are guys that will fucking take the law into their own hands, I guess, in jail.  How old do I sound?  You can take the law into their own hands.  Well, Dahmer got killed in prison because of that.  No, well, he got killed over a jail infraction.  You know, because he had cut a guy.  Because I know he was mopping up or something and they killed him, right?  Or something.  Yeah, Dahmer.  The guy who killed Dahmer in jail was a guy.  It was a black guy who had had a lot of anti-white rage. 
[00:54:30]  I guess he had had problems with white people before.  And the fact that Dahmer killed black people, I'm sure, was a tremendous motivating factor.  And I'd also heard that he had cut the guy in line or something.  And there was some bullshit prison infraction, too.  Yeah, I think it was some kind of weird jail beef.  And, of course, since he is Dahmer, I'm sure he was quicker to get killed.  But, yeah, it was like, it wasn't just, that's the dude that ate people.  That might have been the, but then again, the guy might have had a target on his head.  Who knows?  Because that guy had problems racially with other people. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  But he was a guy, again, another guy doing fucking, you know, X amount of years and never getting out.  Right.  So, my Patty video, I wanted to just plug this on Facebook.  I'm not even getting any money for this.  I posted the video of Patty doing a fucking awful twerking.  And it's got 23,000 comments.  Are they all positive?  No.  A lot of them are horrified.  VOL, vomiting out loud.  I've seen.  Isn't it amazing when, like, we see something like that, like Patty twerking in here. 
[00:55:30]  And it's funny to all of us, but we all know Patty.  And we're like, oh, yeah, we just go home and continue our day.  Other people have never seen Patty before, and they just see this skeletal, you know.  Monster.  Out of the bathroom with a shining woman twerking.  Horrifying.  Yeah.  And it's just, it's gotten 4 million people have seen.  Almost 4 million people.  4 million?  Wow.  On my Facebook, you can see it because I'm the administrator for the fan page.  And it's almost 4 million people have seen the Patty video. 
[00:56:00]  That's great.  I just didn't put it on YouTube.  I don't, again, I don't give a fuck about that.  She's in her panties.  She's looking awful.  I haven't seen it yet.  I've got to see it.  Well, it's not good.  I mean, in the video, I have a great, like, the picture that's kind of like the screen  grab for the video is fucking, is really good.  She looks terrible.  I tried to get a free coffee from her at the Starbucks.  Today?  No, a couple months ago.  I went in there, and she was behind the counter.  I'm like, come on, hook me up.  She's like, I can't have the manager.  She's not here.  I'm like, so? 
[00:56:30]  Give me a discount.  I don't know if I could do that.  Made her all nervous.  Yeah, she was completely, yeah, she was freaking out.  Gonna make her lose her gig.  I'm telling everyone online, I'm like, I know this woman, and she won't even give me 10%  off.  Not even a discount.  Are you happy about the Cowboys?  I didn't care.  Why not?  Because I don't give a fuck about them.  I hate Tony Romo.  I don't care if he had a good game.  Wow.  Big deal.  He's a choke.  The guy, and Cowboy fans kill me for this because I blasted him for the Denver game. 
[00:57:00]  They're like, well, the defense, look, fuck, right, the defense gave up all his points.  Fair.  I'm not saying the defense is good.  But that type of shit happens, and he just, in that final fucking drive, that choke artist  that he is, did it again.  He never pulls through and wins that big game.  So I don't like him at all.  And I don't even want to get cock-teased by this team.  I think they're 3-3 now.  Gives a fuck.  Even if they get to the playoffs, he'll blow it.  He's not a big-game quarterback.  Go ahead. 
[00:57:30]  No, well, I mean, that's the difference between him and Eli Manning.  Eli's having a shit season.  Two huge fourth-quarter, you know, last drives in a Super Bowl to win the game.  Under pressure, it'll pass he through.  And that's why, you know, you want a guy like Eli, even though he's having a shit season,  he doesn't throw for 500 yards, he doesn't throw for 4,800 a year like Romo does.  When you need that guy in a clutch, one minute left, no timeouts on your own 20,  Eli's going to get it done most of the time in two huge games in a Super Bowl.  I mean, that's Montana territory. 
[00:58:00]  And Romo, what does he do?  He fucking fumbles the snap in the playoff game, and he throws the interception.  It's just, I've seen too many times where he's thrown big picks at bad times, and it just makes me hate him.  So you can't even enjoy a big Cowboys victory anymore?  Nah, I don't care.  I mean, I really don't.  Wow.  I don't give a fuck.  I mean, I've lost interest in most sports anyway.  I'm much more casual now about it.  If I'm watching, I get very into it.  But again, after having met enough of them...  Yeah, but your hatred for Romo is not casual. 
[00:58:30]  I just don't like him.  I mean, again, if they were in the playoffs, of course I'd want to see them win.  But the only guys I really give a fuck about anymore are the UFC guys,  because I know so many of them, and they're nice guys.  Yeah, I mean, it's tough for Romo.  You can't see Romo winning a Super Bowl.  You know, to get through a playoff game, a wild card, and then a championship and a Super Bowl.  He'd have to go on an unbelievable run.  I don't know if he has it in him.  He does.  I was watching that Denver game, too.  He was throwing amazing passes, but then that pass, he threw it at Interceptor.  There was no reason to throw that pass. 
[00:59:00]  He had like two minutes left and two or three timeouts.  He had plenty of time.  Throw that ball away.  But in that moment, that's who he is.  Again, I'm not saying the guy's got a great arm,  but he's not a great fucking regular season quarterback,  and he can't get you some great games.  But I will never like a guy who can't ever get it done in that fucking final two minutes.  Most people that support him just look at stats.  Go look at, look, he threw for 500 yards.  He threw 32 touchdowns and only nine interceptions.  Yeah, but when did he throw to nine in the last drive? 
[00:59:30]  That's the difference.  It doesn't matter how many yards you throw for.  Give me a quarterback that throws for 140 yards and wins the game  instead of the guy that threw for 460.  I don't care.  Stats don't mean anything in the NFL anymore.  Yeah, there's a lot of guys.  He's got a 150 QB rating.  Yeah, it doesn't mean so what.  Yeah, because he threw dink and dunk passes down the field  and a speedy receiver broke a tackle and ran 80 yards.  That's how you got that.  Right.  Yeah, that's all fantasy football shit.  That's why everyone's with stats. 
[01:00:00]  Everyone's fascinated by stats.  It means nothing.  Yeah, because they're building out their teams.  They pick what players they like based on who's on their fantasy team  and what the numbers are.  Look at the numbers I did this week.  Running backs rush for like 170 yards now and lose.  They're on a losing team.  That never happened in the NFL before.  You know, now that everyone passes.  So Fred Jackson from the Bills, he had a great game.  He was amazing.  Yes, yeah, but they lost.  Who cares?  Yeah, the defense was playing back because they were expecting a pass. 
[01:00:30]  They were going to let the guy run and run out the clock.  There's a whole thing.  It doesn't matter about that stuff.  When did it change?  You know, probably about seven, eight years ago when they changed the rules  where you couldn't touch a receiver.  Maybe even 10 or 15 where you couldn't touch a receiver after five yards.  And it was all about offense because they realized that offense, more people are going to watch.  And the fantasy football stuff definitely, you know, contributed to it.  When people started playing at it, you know, the NFL's like,  all right, look, we've got nerds watching games that would never watch it before.  Oh, wow. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  That's in the ratings of it, you know, a double of what they were 15 years ago.  That's a good point about that you can't touch the receivers.  And also any type of touching the quarterback is just unallowed almost.  They really have built this so the offense can kind of do what they want.  Absolutely.  Totally.  Just, you know, look at Peyton Manning.  The guy's, you know, 30 for 34 every game, 370 yards.  You can't touch him.  He's too quick.  He gets rid of the ball in two seconds.  You can't get to him that quick.  And the receivers, once after five yards, you can't touch him.  So it's a totally offensive game. 
[01:01:30]  If Marina was playing now, he would have thrown 70 touchdown passes.  He was playing when you could trip the guy 40 yards down the field.  You know, and he was still throwing 48 touchdowns and throwing for 5,000 yards.  He's in the Hall of Famer?  Yeah.  Okay.  Would you have been annoyed if they didn't put him in?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, he never had a running game.  What are you going to do?  And his defense wasn't terrific, was it?  No, he never had a good defense.  You know, and then Jimmy Johnson came in when he didn't want to coach anymore.  He wanted to coach, like, the first year when he came back. 
[01:02:00]  And he was totally, he wanted to retire in the Dolphins to just hang out, you know, one or two more years.  He didn't want to be there anymore.  He was done.  The guy lives on a boat in the fucking Key West and just fishes and drink beers all day.  He didn't want to.  And does the fucking, what does he do?  Yeah, he flies on Saturday night.  He flies to California to do the pregame show.  Makes like 2.5 million a year for 16 weeks.  And then he's on his friggin', you know, living in Key West on the beach.  Do you like the.  Would you want to be in an office for 16 hours a day? 
[01:02:30]  Breaking down film.  Exactly, getting blamed for every time some cunt drops a ball.  Yeah, I know.  Sports radio all over you and everybody hates you.  You got to sleep in your office when you want to go fishing.  He had his time with the.  Questionable call, questionable call.  He had his, yeah, he had his time with the Cowboys.  He did great.  He figured that's where his legacy was.  He should have just left it alone.  Yeah.  And he's just getting micromanaged every little thing he does.  Oh, everywhere, exactly, yeah.  He's doing 16 hours a day in his office and everything he does is getting micromanaged  by a bunch of idiots on the radio. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Do you like those?  I don't like those fucking game day, five guys all yelling out funny things.  Well, you know, it's like, hey, what about the time you played?  And you.  The camera angle, just the long shot is so fucking, you can't even tell who the guys  are.  There's so many guys on the screen.  That's the only way they could fit everyone in, that they got six guys at a round table.  That shot is from like fucking a mile away because that's the only way you could fit  six guys around it.  It's a joke.  You got six guys talking for like 45 yards. 
[01:03:30]  You got 40 seconds to say what you think about the Cowboy Redskins game tonight.  Why are you paying that guy $2 million a year?  I tell you, the defense is looking good, but they better shape it up in the fourth  quarter.  Look, you know, the Cowboys can't turn the ball over and they got to, you know, put pressure  on the quarterback.  Really?  Thanks.  Since when?  Yeah, the way you used to.  Yeah.  Believe me, Dan, you turned the ball over once or twice and you played us Ravens.  Yeah, well, luckily you weren't coming up against me.  Yeah, shuffle of papers. 
[01:04:00]  Where did that one come from?  Do you ever laugh at those jokes?  Never.  I don't even know what they're about.  It makes no sense.  They're not funny.  No, they're not, ever.  Do they have so little faith that those guys can carry like two minutes of conversation  that they need to have half a dozen people at that table?  I think so.  Look, the NFL Network on a Thursday night, the Browns and the Bills, nobody's watching  that game.  Yeah.  There's nothing to talk about.  There's nothing to talk about.  And they got six guys doing a three-hour pregame show. 
[01:04:30]  Of what?  Of what?  I don't even know.  People know, hardcore football fans know maybe four guys on both teams.  And then there's like an hour postgame with six guys on the field.  Deion, Michael Irvin, Rich Eisen, a bunch of guys.  Have you ever seen Jimmy Johnson pull out the big fork?  Does he put the fork in them?  They're done.  Does he do that?  Yeah, I saw him do it like week three.  He was like, I'm going to say it now. 
[01:05:00]  We're only three weeks in.  And he pulls out this fork.  And he was like, put a fork in the Giants.  And it's like a three-foot fork.  That's fucking awful.  You know, Terry Bradshaw is going like, you can't say that already.  You're already putting the fork in them.  Yeah, I'm going to put the fork in them now.  Trying to mimic guy conversations.  Oh, fuck you.  It makes me sick.  And I like Bradshaw.  And I like Jimmy Johnson.  But I just, you know, here's JB, Howie, Fred, Pete, Ted. 
[01:05:30]  Fuck you.  What are two guys?  Two guys is fine.  I also have had enough of, what is it ESPN are the ones that do the tickers?  Like they show you what they're going to be talking about in 10 seconds.  Like that's how short our attention span is.  We have to know, okay, they're only going to talk about this for 20 seconds.  And then they're going to talk about that for 30 seconds.  And then they're going to talk about that for 30 seconds.  Do we fucking need it broken down like that?  Does conversation flow that uncomfortable for people?  Yeah, I know.  They have the tickers, 16, 15, 14.  They've got to go to another topic.  Right, yeah.  Like I have to be guaranteed that I'm going to be interested, not only in what they're 
[01:06:00]  talking about now, but what's the next one?  Because if I'm not going to be interested in the next topic, I'm changing channels now.  Yeah, there's no, you know, look, people can't sit there for a half hour and watch  a sports center.  I don't know.  I don't need to know what's coming up next on the side.  Yeah, what are you changing to?  Like if you want to hear people talk about sports, you watch that.  If you don't want to hear people talk about sports, you watch something else.  You know what I mean?  I think it actually hurts people.  Like if I'm watching ESPN and I don't care about basketball or hockey, which I don't, 
[01:06:30]  and I see that's coming up on the side, that's coming up.  I'm going to switch the channel.  I'm going to go over to Major League Baseball channel or NFL network.  Right.  To go get some highlights.  I'm going to go, all right, I'm not interested in that.  So if you didn't show me, I'd stay tuned in.  Yeah, you might sit through the hockey talk.  Absolutely.  Because you think they're going to go back to football after.  Oh, the fork.  That's brutal.  That's a fork in him.  God, that makes my skin crawl.  You know when that would be really funny?  If somebody in the family was on life support and he pulled it out. 
[01:07:00]  I'm going to say it now.  We're going to put a fork in him.  That would be hilarious.  If he pulled that out of the back of his sweater vest, you're like, all right, that's  kind of funny because they're all tubed up.  Who's winning in baseball?  I haven't watched the playoffs.  The Red Sox came back last night.  They were down 5-0 in the sixth.  And it was 5-1 in the eighth inning.  That guy Scherzer, the Tigers pitcher, who's been pitching unbelievable this year.  They take him out.  He's at 108 pitches.  They bring in Detroit's eighth. 
[01:07:30]  Detroit's bullpen is a disaster.  And next thing you know, bases are loaded in the bottom of the eighth.  Ortiz is up.  Down 5-1.  Hits a grand slam.  That son of a bitch is great in a big spot.  They didn't score a run for like 18 innings or so, or 17 innings to Boston.  They got shut out the first game.  They were like two hit up to the eighth inning there.  No offense whatsoever.  As soon as they got to the bullpen and then the ninth, they won it.  Boston.  See, that's just to me like, why would they, I know they're probably thinking about saving  that guy for another game.  108 pitches is a lot.  But it's like, unless you're starting to walk people, just let the guy pitch until he's 
[01:08:00]  not pitching well.  Especially when you know you've got a shit bullpen.  Keep that guy in there.  You've got to win that.  If you're up 2-0 going back to Detroit against the Red Sox, you're in great shape.  You can pitch that guy, you know, game seven if you have to.  You don't have to pitch him on three days rest.  It's overmanaging.  It's fucking, and I love Joe Torre, but he did it obsessively with Rivera.  Once like Nelson and Stanton were kind of gone, or he lost faith in them.  Just automatically bringing him in the eighth inning. 
[01:08:30]  It's like you overuse the bullpen.  And if your bullpen's terrible, just fucking stop it.  Let the pitcher throw.  He can throw more than 100 pitches.  What's the thing in saving him for another game?  Yeah, part of it.  Or, you know, the 100-pitch count, basically.  But, you know, Bruce Bochy from the Giants, that's why they won two out of three World  Series the last two or three.  They left Matt Cain, Lincecum, guys like that, Baumgartner, in for 110, 120 pitches.  He's like, look, I'm not blowing this.  I'm not putting my middle relief guys in the seventh.  When they got to Brian Wilson in the ninth or Sergio Romo, they knew those guys were 
[01:09:00]  good, but he wasn't taking a chance going in the eighth inning.  How annoying is it?  When you got Matt Cain on the mound pitching a masterpiece, he's like, I'm not going there  because it's supposed to.  In the regular season, it says that 100 pitches, 110 definitely take him out.  That's dumb.  Those guys in the 30s and 40s threw 160 pitches.  Whitey Ford, I think, pitched a friggin' back-to-back doubleheader on the same day.  And those guys pitched for like friggin' 18 years.  A lot of those guys pitched back-to-back doubleheaders.  With no conditioning, they didn't have the nutrition they have now, doctors and stuff 
[01:09:30]  like that, and they would use car sales in the off-season because they needed money.  Yeah, if you hurt your arm, they put ice on it.  That's when you got an ice bag to take home with you.  Yeah, and you were out there two days later.  Yeah.  Yeah, they constantly pitched.  It was like everybody did a lot.  Fighters fought more back then.  They would fight fucking six, eight weeks apart.  They would pitch doubleheaders.  And I guess now you can't because there's so much money at stake.  And we don't hear the stories of all the guys who blew out their arm in 1940.  Yeah, plus they all, I mean, by the time all those guys are 50, they're all just destroyed. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  All right, how about the Dodgers?  It's down to nothing going into Los Angeles, yeah.  I was kind of rooting for them because I did that Leno piece where I interviewed a lot of them.  They were actually really nice guys.  That was a great piece.  Thanks, man.  That was really funny.  Thank you.  Yeah, I was just, but they were cool.  I couldn't believe all the dick jokes they let you get away with.  It's fucking amazing.  It was unbelievable.  It's amazing.  There was one moment in there that they, NBC lets you get away with a lot, but there  was one thing that we wanted to keep so bad. 
[01:10:30]  And it was an innocent, we talked to the organ player, an old woman who plays the organ in  Dodger Stadium.  And she happened to be on the field.  So look, I fucking talked to her.  And we started, you know, I just did the dumb joke.  And she's like, I'm the organ player.  And I said, oh boy, I really sucked on the organ.  You know, just the dumb blowjob joke.  But then we said, like, if there's ever been a song you were supposed to play, or you weren't  supposed to play that you did.  Just, it was a no, a no, who gives a shit question.  And she goes, yes.  One time, I didn't pay attention to what was happening on the field. 
[01:11:00]  I thought the game was happening.  I wasn't, you know, she wasn't watching.  And she said they were honoring Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, his last game.  Like, you know, we were playing in Los Angeles.  They were doing a big thing.  And I was playing Bye Bye Blackbird.  And it was a complete accident.  And you knew it was an accident.  And it was such an innocent moment.  And she was saying how, like, embarrassed she was.  She was an old lady?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:11:30]  And there was no malice in it.  But just, you know, and this is just the culture we live in.  The mention of race.  And that was fucking hilarious.  Because you knew she didn't mean it.  And that was one.  Plus, we didn't have time for all of that.  But that was one I wish we had left in.  But, you know, because it wasn't a dick joke.  It was one of those.  And they did.  They would.  No way.  Yeah, I guess.  I think it made the almost final cut.  But there was a couple that they took out in the final cut.  Just for timing.  You know.  But that was one I wish we had kept.  That's why Leno likes you a lot, though.  Right?  The dick jokes.  Like, it seems like all. 
[01:12:00]  Because Leno prides himself on being nice.  And kind of digestible to the entire country.  And then he brings you in.  Like, you could tell.  He's getting a kick out.  Like, when you're making dick jokes.  Right.  He's like, I want to say this stuff.  But I'll let him say it.  Yeah.  But although, if it's too many dick jokes, Jay's like, eh.  Like, you know.  There's too.  Like, they kind of let me have that area.  Like, where I can be dirtier.  Even in the coulda, woulda, shouldas.  They kind of let me get away with a lot of harsher stuff.  Which is nice.  You know.  It's kind of freeing and fun.  The racial stuff I'd love to do. 
[01:12:30]  No, you can't.  Anywhere.  She would have lost her job.  If that would have caught fire.  That little clip.  Look at this organ player.  Who knows?  Maybe.  Yeah, that's true.  Although, she did that in 88.  That was 20 years ago.  That happened.  Yeah.  Well, Paula Deen also said she said the N-word.  That's true.  They never said when.  Could have been in 1963 when her uncle told her a joke and said, say it back.  When she was a little girl.  Who knows?  That's right.  That's true.  Yeah, I mean, doing it in 88.  If she had come forward.  Like, even if nobody would have had a problem.  But even if they did.  She could have said, oh yeah, that was a mistake. 
[01:13:00]  I wasn't paying attention.  I'm a moron.  Everybody would have been like, ha ha, okay.  Yeah, when I was a young girl.  Like, whatever.  But I said it.  But you know what?  She might have knew that somebody.  If she went there.  That somebody recently has a tape of her saying it.  Or her assistant.  She said it all the time.  Who knows?  Who's Paula Deen?  Yeah, you never know.  But she never thought that that would get out.  And that she would lose everything because of it.  Yeah, under oath it's really hard to lie.  Because you just know that, man.  If it ever.  If I fucked up. 
[01:13:30]  Or if it comes back.  This is not just a little lie anymore.  This is a legal issue.  Yeah.  You know, I always think it's so easy just to bullshit.  But under oath you just can't.  Well, you shouldn't.  They said it's really tough to convict you on perjury, though.  Oh, is it really?  Yeah, if you're taking a deposition, though.  Why?  A lot of the baseball players have got it.  It's just tough to prove.  That you were lying and not mistaken?  Yeah.  That you were lying.  A lot of the baseball players, all these guys that took steroids and all that stuff.  Oh, they lied.  And then they tried to get him in court and they never get him.  What do you think is going to happen with Alex Rodriguez?  Is he being a cunt or is he being smart about this? 
[01:14:00]  No, he's being smart.  He should have just got 50 games like everybody else.  Right.  Why is he getting more?  Because Bud Selick's got a hard-on for him.  Bud Selick loves Hank Aaron as his idol.  He used to own the friggin' Brewers, which, you know, Hank Aaron was part of later in his career.  He's best buddies with him.  He doesn't want Rodriguez going near his records.  And that's why he's punishing him way, way harsher.  That's why he went after Bonds, too, and stuff.  Oh, okay.  Yes, Selick's a dick.  Yeah, I don't like him either.  Rodriguez would have taken 50 games.  He said, I'll give me the 50 like everybody else and we'll move on. 
[01:14:30]  But when he goes 211, so he says, all right, there's no way A-Rod will even play a year  and a half from now.  You know, at 41, he's going to be.  What is Selick's reason, though, for giving him more?  Like, what is the, he has to justify it.  Because he tried to cover it up, Rodriguez.  When he found out that, you know, shit was coming down, he contacted the guys from the,  you know, from that, that Dr. Bosch or whatever, and said, hey, dude, hide the files.  And Major League Baseball's coming, basically.  And he goes, well, he tried to cover it up. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, who wouldn't if he's going to get caught?  Absolutely.  Should he just go, hey, man, just, you know, say what you got to say.  Just be honest.  He's not going to do that.  His career's on the line.  Everyone tries to cover it.  Everyone lies.  Everybody was doing it, yeah.  Yeah.  You'd be a fucking idiot not to.  And look, that HGH stuff gets guys back on the field quicker.  It heals injuries.  They should all be taking it.  The guy's a superstar, whether you like him or not.  Yeah.  You know, when he goes to, you know, St. Louis or he goes to, you know, Kansas City,  people want to see A-Rod on the field, whether to boo him or whether they like him.  Right.  You know, so you want to get your superstars back on the field. 
[01:15:30]  The shit doesn't, it doesn't make you a better ball player.  It heals injuries.  When your injury is healed, the doctor on the team should go, all right, he's healed,  and now you can't take it anymore.  Get the guys back on the field as soon as possible.  It's dumb.  What exactly does A-G-H, now, is it bad for me to take or you to take?  No, a lot of older people take it, HGH, it's called.  Oh, it's HGH, okay.  Yeah, it's basically, it heals all your, you know, your muscles and stuff like that.  It helps your insides a lot.  Is it a steroid?  It's considered a steroid, but it's not. 
[01:16:00]  They consider it a performance-enhancing drug because it gives you energy.  It actually cuts down body fat.  It helps build muscle, not like steroids.  Should I take it?  You should, I mean, you know, they say guys that, like, you know, 45 to 50 should probably  be taking it.  Okay.  Just for health reasons alone.  What's the hormone that you produce when you're a kid, right?  When you're growing.  Yeah, when you're growing, and they actually have it for little kids that don't grow.  Yeah, I used it.  To make them grow.  But it doesn't make, it doesn't make your head, yeah, it doesn't make your head grow  as you're older, or your hands, you don't have these fucking huge hands and shit like 
[01:16:30]  that, and it doesn't cause cancer, which, you know, the medical community will say that  because they know that it can heal a lot of shit.  Right.  And then it takes money out of their pockets because they want you on fucking pills.  I would like to, can we ask Dr. Steve that?  Can we try to get Dr. Steve, uh, because he's usually pretty straight about, he's always  pretty straight about this.  Like, he doesn't, you know, he'll, he'll go with the anti-medical route or the, I'm  curious as to what he thinks of it.  I remember Art Bell, when I used to ride around and listen to Art Bell at night, when we were  kicked off the air in 2000, I could only listen to Art Bell or Joe Benigno at night. 
[01:17:00]  I couldn't listen to, uh, fucking radio like Opie and Anthony did because it just made  me too bummed out.  And Art Bell would always fucking plug HGH.  One of the, by the way, one of the greatest radio guys ever, Art Bell.  I mean, he's not serious now, right?  I'm serious now.  I listen to him in the morning when I'm driving in.  Nobody teased something better than Art Bell.  He would have guys do phoners only in ISDN and he would keep them on the phone for five  hours.  Yeah.  And that cocksucker knew how to tease a break.  Wow.  Was he good. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Coming up.  And then the whole next break, they didn't do it.  He just kept you on hold.  He just knew how to keep you there listening.  Son of a bitch is great.  So whatever.  He would, he was the first person I ever heard mentioned HGH because of, uh, you know, it  was one of his sponsors.  Yeah.  I was a small kid.  I used HGH for like three or four years.  That really makes me want to fucking injure you with a fucking hammer.  I don't know.  Just a little slight of frame.  Why?  You were a little kid.  So they gave it to you?  Yeah.  I was like, uh, I was still like four 11 when I was in high school.  Oh, what a twerp. 
[01:18:00]  What a fucking twerp.  Yeah.  As a freshman in high school, I was like four 11.  Oh, how humiliating.  You dwarf.  So they fucking gave it to you.  Mother gave it to you.  She wanted her little Sam to grow up.  Well, I, we talked about it.  We made a joint decision.  It wasn't just my mom.  It was your mule regular size.  Or was that small too?  I think it was proportionate.  I don't even really remember.  He wasn't using it.  So you weren't getting laid.  No.  Nobody wants to fuck a four 11 pre-pubescent looking freshman.  Except God.  Because that's what he did when he made you.  Yeah, exactly.  Your fucking little underdeveloped cock with the skin. 
[01:18:30]  Because Sam had to be circumcised when he was older because the skin was too much on his little peenie.  I was circumcised when I was 19.  Oh.  Yeah, it was rough.  How much did that hurt?  I mean, you know, they knock you out when they do it.  But then it's like, oh, we, at least a week of recovery.  But why did you get it done at 19?  Why didn't you just let it go?  Because my foreskin, the hole in it was big enough to pee through, but not big enough to go over the head of my dick.  So.  Your dick's that small? 
[01:19:00]  That there was so much skin that your, your helmet wouldn't even come out?  No, it's not a matter of my dick being small.  The hole was too small.  The hole.  Oh, okay, all right.  The hole was too small.  Okay, I thought that there was so much skin that your helmet wouldn't even come out.  No, no, no.  I was going to say.  No.  But his dick probably smelled terrible, though.  The hole in the foreskin was too small.  Don't try to blow him.  I couldn't find it.  It smells like a piss balloon.  No, it never had any odors.  Shut up.  How do you know?  You didn't put it by your face.  Not my hands.  Yeah, but you're holding the side of your dick and pissing. 
[01:19:30]  You don't put your dick in the hole, your finger in the hole where a girl's mouth is going to go.  I guess.  So when did you get laid?  At what age?  18.  I got laid when I had it like that.  How tall were you?  At 18?  Meaning, like, you're 4'11".  Your parents, by the way, were probably putting it in your cereal without telling you they were so humiliated that this fucking...  Your father was probably so embarrassed that this little nothing had tumbled out of his bag.  The only thing long on him was his foreskin.  Yeah, I know.  It wasn't...  A rotten fucking snuffle off of his trunk dick.  My foreskin was not extra long. 
[01:20:00]  Droopy, awful foreskin.  It wasn't droopy.  Yes, it was.  No, it was tight.  That was the problem.  So you start taking HGH.  What is it, a pill you take?  No, it's injected.  Okay.  And how long did you have to take it and how long did it take to work?  Shrimp.  Fucking little shrimp.  I think I took it for...  It's bullying.  I think I took it for like three years and then probably took like a year and a half before  it really started to work and then...  Now, how long...  He was the only guy in high school when he sat in his seat, his feet didn't touch the ground. 
[01:20:30]  No, but not only did they not...  Yeah, just swing.  No, they would stick straight out.  Not only did they not touch the ground, they would stick straight out.  You fucking little baby seat feet.  You had a little step by your death to get down.  My knees weren't bent over the seat.  Like, they were back on it.  You were a junior before they stopped calling you Sammy.  How long after you started getting your injection, did you run home and stand in that little  fucking numbered chart that would get undoubtedly on your door?  Mark the thing against the wall.  I think you grew, Sam.  That's why he's got his hair like that. 
[01:21:00]  It gives him a little height.  Were you like Bobby Brady and you hung from the swing set to grow?  Remember that episode he hung?  Because he wanted to be taller, so he hung from a swing set from his arms.  I don't remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  I do.  No, I do that.  No.  And then Mr. Brady jerked off watching him like the fucking BTK killer.  I just mean it.  But it didn't make you grow, though?  Yeah, yeah.  It grew like a foot, almost.  How do you know that wasn't just normal growth?  Because when I was, they scan your hand, they x-ray your hand, and they look at the gaps 
[01:21:30]  between your bones and figure out what your bone age is.  So I had the bone age of like an 11-year-old when I was like 14.  Ew, ew, your little young bones.  Oh, it makes me want to break them.  Did you still have a soft spot on top of your head like a baby?  That makes me want to snap your arm.  Like, how great would it be to snap his little underdeveloped...  It's not underdeveloped anymore.  Yes, it is.  You're at 30 right now.  You have the arms of a 27-year-old.  It really bugs me.  But so...  So then they were like... 
[01:22:00]  They said, you'll be like 5'2", maybe, if you don't use HGH.  Like, they said, that's how tall.  You'll be about 5'2".  God, do I wish you didn't use it.  So what are you right now?  5'9", 5'10".  He's a lot taller than me.  You know how embarrassing that is?  Fucking shrimp-o, fucking shot right past me.  Yeah.  HGH.  It's the greatest thing I ever did.  And that got you laid, too, right?  Because you were...  Everything.  Everything.  It gave you some height, and all of a sudden, at 18, you got laid.  Yep.  Confidence.  People would take me a little...  People wouldn't take me seriously at all. 
[01:22:30]  Like, people barely take me seriously now.  People wouldn't take me seriously at all.  If I was 5'2", trying to do interviews with people, sticking my arm up in the air.  Just a little fella.  Little baby arm.  Yeah.  Little eager guy.  Little 14-year-old aged arm.  I'm 30!  Yeah.  Hey, what do you think?  Fuck off, kid.  Yeah.  So if I took it now, it wouldn't be bad.  I want to...  Are we trying Dr. Stevie Rock?  No, I'll get him right now.  Keith in New Jersey is a thing.  Hi, it's Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  My cousin had a brain tumor, and at nine, he was like Gary Coleman. 
[01:23:00]  He was like three foot something at nine years old, and he had to do the HGH injections  just like Sam, and now he's like 6'2".  But the thing is, it's illegal, though.  I mean, you know, you can't...  Why?  Well, it's not something you can just get over the counter at GNC.  It's like it's got to be prescribed by a doctor.  Yeah, it's prescription.  It's not illegal.  Yeah, it's prescription.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, but I think what's happening with these baseball players is, you know, they're not  getting prescriptions for it.  They're just getting it illegally and injecting themselves with HGH. 
[01:23:30]  That's what I mean by, you know, illegally.  You know what I mean?  So I think that's the controversy.  But, I mean, I've seen, like, these late-night commercials where they're selling, quote-unquote,  HGH, like, tablets and stuff.  But apparently, it's like such a little powder of HGH.  It's bogus.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you need to inject it.  You can't take...  Yeah, you got to inject it.  But also, the baseball players and the sports guys are taking...  If you're supposed to take, like, two milligrams, they're taking ten.  Right.  They're jacking up on the stuff.  When you're not supposed...  That's not the way you're supposed to take it.  And they're done growing. 
[01:24:00]  They're not taking it to...  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  You know, when they're not kids.  All right, thanks, Keith.  But, yeah, it was...  That and getting circumcised at 19 is the greatest decision I ever made.  Well, you...  For you, it's a weird...  I get a weird thing with circumcision.  But for you, it was a necessity.  It was like you're just...  You're underdeveloped, bad DNA just didn't grow your penis properly.  It wasn't bad DNA.  It was just the way it happened.  But there's also a thing.  I mean, in America, girls like a dick that's circumcised. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Just the aesthetic of it.  Even in Europe, they want a cock that pokes through the foreskin.  They like...  There's nowhere in the world they like your teeny fucking pinhole little dickhead poking through.  You can say it in a past tense.  Don't say it in the present tense.  All right, they didn't like that.  There's nowhere in the world your cock was acceptable.  And I changed that.  Except maybe in the gay community where they probably wouldn't...  You know, there's certain guys that like the smell of piss on their head, I'm sure.  Yeah, but I couldn't even dock.  Oh, that's right.  I couldn't have docked because my foreskin didn't stretch out like that. 
[01:25:00]  What an age risk, fuck you.  You know, because they said uncircumcised guys are more likely because, you know, that...  It's just this...  Bacteria can live better on the head.  The age juice just stays in there.  Oh, it's you.  Yeah, pulling it back and forth.  Absolutely, yeah.  His fucking cock looks like one of those goldfish bags you carry home for the carnival.  So, yeah, that was just a fucking...  I got my son circumcised and I kept the foreskin.  I still have it in my freezer.  No, what you got...  Why?  I don't know, because the doctor's like, all right, I'm going to do the foreskin. 
[01:25:30]  And my brother-in-law was there.  I'm like, can you bring that piece of skin in?  He's like, for what?  I go, my friend here likes to keep them.  He's like, what?  I go, yeah, he sells them on eBay.  The doctor's like, you're joking, right?  I go, no, no, actually, I'd like to get it if I could.  And then like 10 minutes later, he came in with it in a jar.  Does that creep you out?  And then the nurse comes in 10 minutes later, she goes, wait, I got to label that.  Give me the jar, like, you know, I don't know how many people have taken the foreskin  home in a jar that it was going to get confused.  It's still in my freezer.  I thought it went bad during Sandy Storm, the hurricane, because I had no power for like 
[01:26:00]  two weeks.  I was freaking out because I thought I was going to, you know, the skin was going to go  bad in the freezer.  What did you put it in?  It's in a little jar.  In alcohol?  No, it's just in a...  Why don't you put it in alcohol?  It's not in any water or anything?  No, it's just in a gauze.  Yeah.  Put it in alcohol.  Fucking, that's how you preserve things.  Are you trying to save like the stem cells or are you just trying to have the memories?  Just the memories, just in case my son, you know, if he's packing like me, he's going  to need like an extra half inch when he's like 17.  It's his own skin.  You can put it back on?  Yeah.  And if not, you could dry it out like a flower and put it in a photo album.  My friend wanted to eat it. 
[01:26:30]  He did.  Like, we're going to do another hidden camera DVD and my friend said, let's open the DVD  by me eating your son's foreskin.  I was thinking about it, but then I'm like, how do I...  How does my son, when he's like 18, hanging out with his friends, like, my dad had a friend  that ate my fucking foreskin.  And you'd be like, well, look at it.  It's hilarious.  But at that point, it's like, and he's got it on film too.  Yeah.  I can't do that to the kid.  Yeah.  He sells it at gigs.  Yeah.  Your son would be like, why wouldn't you just use a fake foreskin?  It's on camera.  Nobody knows.  No, it's got to be real.  Yeah.  It can't be fake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, you're probably, I think you should put it in alcohol because they say preserve things 
[01:27:00]  for fucking centuries in alcohol.  I'll do that when I get home.  Yeah.  I feel bad now.  But all of a sudden you put it in alcohol and then it just dissolves.  Because I do look at it every once in a while.  I, you know, hold it up to the light.  I'm like, there it is.  Nice.  How long did it take them to circumcise him?  Like 10 minutes they were done.  It was a long time though, right?  Of cutting.  I don't know how long actually, but I know like 10 minutes later he was back in the room  with a piece of skin in a jar.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was knocked out for mine for a few hours, but obviously that's just the...  Sure.  Because you're an adult. 
[01:27:30]  It's just the drugs.  You want to slug somebody.  What, uh, we have any Dr. Steve update?  He's not answering.  He's away on vacation.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  What an asshole.  I wouldn't want to bother somebody on vacation.  What do you think of these fucking veterans storming, uh, I keep looking down at the story  while we're talking.  The veterans storming these memorials.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  They've just had enough.  Yeah.  Fucking dumb, dumb government they defended.  What, everything, imagine fighting in World War II and going through all that and then  have this bullshit happening now.  Where like you can't even go to the memorial because nobody can agree on health insurance. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  I feel like he's pretty sick.  It was at Sarah Palin there yesterday.  Did she do something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's just getting her face out there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I, the veterans, it's like, if you're going to keep anything open.  Yeah.  Is congressional, is there security still there?  Are the things for Congress, uh, President of the Secret Service is still working.  Oh, yeah.  Um, I bet, I bet you the president has every amenity that he's used to.  I bet you Congress and, and, uh, senators.  The janitors who clean the House of Congress are still cleaning, making sure everything's spotless. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  And the government, there's going to be government functions that don't stay open during a shutdown.  And I understand that the memorial is not a necessary function, but there's a certain respect for guys who literally are paralyzed because they went overseas and fucking took a bullet.  So you didn't have to, it's like, come on, man.  You can't fucking close there.  The D.C. cops are still working around that area and they're supposed to keep everybody out.  But when they started coming down last week, the cops just moved aside and like, what are we going to do?  We can't tell these guys. 
[01:29:00]  No, they can't go.  They want to go stop them.  Yeah.  Cops are maintaining order, but they're not preventing them from going in, even though it's closed.  Yeah.  She shouldn't.  I mean, a guy, again, these guys got back from Vietnam.  They always have to fight for their health care and stuff like that.  Like, you know, it really is revolting the way a lot of veterans get treated.  Yeah.  It's like, leave these guys, let them, if they want to go look at the memorial, let them look at it.  Or have a skeleton staff or we're taking, you know, could we stop giving money to Egypt?  Finally, I think, because they're going to embrace fucking Sharia law.  So good for us to stop giving the money. 
[01:29:30]  How about all the money that it would take to run the veterans memorials?  We remove funding from one shit country, whatever that, whatever the country is.  We remove a little bit of funding and put it here.  So the memorials to the veterans can stay open.  Just leave it open.  Just leave the doors open.  You know what I mean?  Like, what does the staff do?  Show everybody around?  Yeah, I know.  Help everybody find the names?  Like, just let people just go and find it themselves.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Obama should have said that.  Look, we're leaving a couple things open like this and this. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  We're going to make sure we're paying for the soldiers that are coming home.  We're going to give them a hundred grand right off the bat.  Because that was another thing where the families weren't getting paid.  If you die, you know, your family will get $100,000 within like three days sent right to your bank account to cover funeral expenses and everything else.  And they weren't even holding that back because it was a government shutdown.  Do they tax it too?  Or they find it?  Probably.  Scumbags.  I'm sure they do.  But how could they hold that back?  And then they get you on a fucking death tax.  So they probably want to give you a 20 grand.  Yeah, so you wind up at like $17,500. 
[01:30:30]  How could they hold that back though?  It's not like you can pay for your funeral later.  You know what I mean?  Like you can't be like, well, we'll put the funeral off for a couple weeks.  Once the government figures all their stuff out, we'll get the money and then we'll do a funeral.  Yeah, there was a few families.  There was like four or five that didn't get the money and didn't have money for the funeral.  It's ridiculous.  And didn't the Amber Alert, which was probably just a, you know what I'm saying, I'm hoping that's back up.  Didn't that part of the website get shut down?  Yeah.  Like they just shut down everything and it's like, really?  Like those are the things that are necessary.  I saw a thing on Lifetime. 
[01:31:00]  Yes, I said that.  Were you watching it with a chick?  No, I was alone, just feeling emotional, eating ice cream.  Fucking feeling my tits.  And I was watching the show on the girl who Amber Alert's based on.  Her name, you know, she was kidnapped, of course, and raped and murdered by some fucking animal, of course.  They never caught the guy who actually did it, but I'm sure he's the guy who had prior convictions.  And there was an interesting story on this system now, which, you know, is how we track fucking missing kids. 
[01:31:30]  I think every state has it.  Is there any state that does not have it?  We have no one in here on the computer.  Travis, he was going to be in here.  What's he doing?  He's on the phones because the intern's doing runs.  Okay.  Fair enough.  All right.  Yeah, no, I don't know if, I don't know if, I think, every state, you would think it would have it by now.  Yeah, I remember when they announced a while ago, like, some state got it.  I'm like, how is this just not automatic, unless it takes a while to put the system in place?  But more importantly, you were just watching this movie on Lifetime? 
[01:32:00]  Well, yeah, I mean, I was fucking, you know, you go through Fios, and you see what's playing, and I happen to like the fact that it was the Amber Alert thing, so I was kind of interested.  You just watch unhappy shit.  I do.  Like, if it's not a beheading video, it's a documentary on the case that created Amber, or it's this story about Baby Hope, or whatever it is.  Yeah.  You don't like anything pleasant?  You don't like to have a laugh?  I do.  Yeah, but you don't like, I don't like happy endings, either.  Not at all?  When I watch stuff, not really.  Even true stories, though?  Well, true stories, maybe, but it's, you know. 
[01:32:30]  Me and my wife watched that This Is 40 movie the other day, the Judd Apatow movie, and I knew at the end they were going to,  it was going to work out.  Yeah.  I saw it from the first minute, and I wasn't, I wasn't happy.  You weren't?  No, I was like, please, come on, just give me something else.  It bothers you that people want to leave the theater having a pleasant experience?  Yeah, you know, walk, just when they get back together and they decide, yeah, we're going to do this,  get hit by a fucking truck when you're walking across the street and just end there.  That would have been a way, but for me, I was like, that's a cool ending. 
[01:33:00]  They died together.  Yeah.  I don't need, you know, oh, yeah, and they walk away.  What are we going to, well, we'll see what our future's going to be, and then they start walking.  And then that's it.  I'm like, why?  Why does it always have to wrap up nice?  Always has to wrap up.  And here's the beauty of a bad ending, like a sad ending.  It makes me wish for a happy ending like that.  And I like wishing for that.  Like, I like when something happens in a movie that makes me like, oh, I really wish it had a happy ending.  I'm like, fuck.  But it makes me like the movie more because I'm walking away feeling something. 
[01:33:30]  Like Cuckoo's Nest.  Yeah.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has a miserable fucking ending.  Yeah.  And every time I watch that movie, I wish it had a happy ending.  Yeah.  I wish that they left.  But the fact that it gets that out of me, I love.  And that's why I like sad movies, because it makes me feel something.  Did you see Prisoners, the Hugh Jackman movie?  I did not.  Oh.  I thought it was pretty good.  Yeah, it was good.  But I just wanted, I was wondering what you thought about that ending, but you didn't see it.  Did you see Gravity?  Yeah.  You saw Gravity.  Jim, did you see Gravity?  No, was it good?  It's great. 
[01:34:00]  I heard.  It's fucking great.  And I love how they ended it.  I'm not going to say what it was.  I'm not going to say what parts might have been happy, what parts might not have been happy.  But they just did things that I didn't see coming.  Oh, I know what you're talking about now.  When you said there was the thing that you thought might go one way, but then it ended up going a different way.  And I loved it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I was like, oh, you cheese dick cocksuckers.  And I was like, oh, my God.  That's nice.  I love that they did what they did.  So there's some cool moments in that.  A lot of close calls, though.  A lot, yeah.  Once in a while, I don't mind a happy ending. 
[01:34:30]  But you want it to be deserved.  There was that movie with Alec Baldwin, that Vegas movie with William H. Macy and Maria.  The Cooler.  The Cooler.  That was a great, that was a happy ending at the end.  Because it was such bad luck in that guy's life in Baltimore.  Right.  That it was cool that they got the money.  And I was like, holy shit.  That was okay for a good ending.  There has to be misery somewhere.  Like, if you're going to have a happy ending, you better have a miserable movie.  Because when that cop was going to shoot him in the head, in execution style, on the side  of the road, I'm like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.  Holy shit. 
[01:35:00]  These guys have bad luck.  You like when he punched a pregnant chick right in the stomach?  Yes.  He said it.  Yes.  Yes, I did.  But some of the greatest movies have happy endings.  One Flew Over the...  I didn't.  Clockwork Orange has a happy ending.  The Godfather has a happy ending.  Although Clockwork Orange, like, you want...  Because he's...  But he's an anti-hero, though.  Exactly.  But, I mean, the ending is happy.  An unhappy ending for that movie, because you're rooting for this fucking sociopath.  Right.  An unhappy ending is him to have to stay stuck in this tortured, shitty existence. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  But he's not.  He's fantasizing about rape.  I was cured, all right.  And you're like, oh, he's back.  It's not a happy ending for the homeless guys that he beat the shit out of, or the woman  that he rapes, or the...  You know that he's going to be a piece of garbage with a happy ending.  The bad guy wins in The Godfather.  Yeah.  Michael was a fucking murderer.  The whole family was murderers.  And in the end, he takes over and he wins.  That's true.  Scarface is a sad ending, because the Cuban drug dealer dies.  And you just want him to win.  In what is the most annoying assassination moment in movie history, the guy with sunglasses 
[01:36:00]  and the members-only jackets.  Yeah.  Those sunglasses at night, that...  I guarantee you, if Brian De Palma could undo anything in his life, it would be putting  sunglasses on the guy that kills Montana at the end of that.  Well, that is such a great movie.  Yeah, you're right.  That's terrible.  But that movie is the ultimate, like, movie for moments where it's dated.  Yeah.  Like, there's the montage, there's the guy with the sunglasses and the members-only jacket,  there's the whole thing.  Like, it still holds up, it's still amazing, but it is so... 
[01:36:30]  80s.  Like, it's dripping 80s.  Totally is.  You had a montage in the middle, and they're all...  Yeah.  Dude, the limit.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Limit!  He's the only guy...  I've never seen a guy get shot so many times and still keep shooting.  Yeah.  He must have had at least 46 bullets in him, and he was still firing away.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it made it believable, because he did all that blow right before.  The blow.  Yeah, right.  It's just...  He's got his face, his full face in that mountain of blow. 
[01:37:00]  And I don't even mind that when he's getting shot at the end, even though I know it's...  Like, take you out the fucking hell.  Like, that's such a cool moment.  I can take it.  Yeah, you're right.  I'll suspend disbelief.  Well, by that time, the movie is so, like, campy that you're like, okay, I'm in.  But every fucking, like, the major...  Just turn it down a little bit, my love.  Like, every major drug dealer in Mexico, these guys, they all have Scarface posters.  Like, Pacino's a guy that would not be beheaded.  No, he'd be idolized.  Except he wasn't listening. 
[01:37:30]  He was.  He didn't hear you.  Thank you.  Yeah, he'd be idolized.  But...  They love Pacino.  But they'd probably make him dress up as Scarface every day.  I'm sure he'd be happy to.  Yeah, just wear that white suit all the time with the black shirt under it.  Real gangsters, like, real murdering drug dealers love Scarface.  Like, real mobsters, really mafia guys loved the fucking Godfather.  They branded him pay for a meal for the rest of his life, literally.  I wonder how De Palma feels that, like, his movie has inspired generations of drug dealers and gangsters to get into that line of work. 
[01:38:00]  I don't think it did.  I think what it does is, I think the same as The Godfather, movies that paint these guys how they see themselves, which is men of honor, men with codes, men of discipline.  Like, you look at The Godfather.  He was a ruthless guy, but he had honor and he had a code.  You look at Scarface.  He loved kids.  He would not kill that guy with fucking children in the car.  He was an animal, but he was honest. 
[01:38:30]  He told the truth.  Like, there was things about him that are very, very likable and respectable.  He had a code.  He had a code, so men in that line of work go, that's how I see myself.  Right.  And they kind of grab it.  And he was tough.  He was not a pussy, and he never fucking sold out.  And neither did the guy, you know.  They probably, nobody wants to see a movie about a drug dealer who all of a sudden converts, you know, realizes that he's a homosexual and tells on all his friends.  That would not have been a popular ending for Scarface.  Right.  Or just take shit from Frank the entire movie. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, or Frank slapped him in the face, and then Tony serviced him orally.  Right, right.  He would not have been a hero.  While Michelle Pfeiffer watches.  Yeah.  How sexy was she with that?  Oh, my God.  Dude, what a fucking ass on her.  Put what, where I fuck.  It's none of your business.  That terrible dancing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just wonderful.  I made one of the worst decisions ever.  I remember when that movie came out.  Oh, I thought you were going to say comedy.  If you see the upcoming dates I have, you'll know why.  It was a bad decision.  But when that movie came out, I was going on a first date with this girl, and it was Scarface 
[01:39:30]  in the movie theater, and it was a Barbra Streisand movie, and I can't remember what it is right  now.  Yentl?  Yentl.  Or Yentl?  Yentl.  Yentl.  Came out at the same week or the same time they were in the theaters, and I'm like, what  do you want to see?  And I really wanted to see Scarface.  She's like, I heard Scarface might be a little violent, and I don't really like those kind  of movies.  I'd really like to see Yentl.  I'm like, all right, sure.  And we went and saw Yentl instead of Scarface, and she was only like a four. 
[01:40:00]  She was only a four.  Did she blow you?  Nothing.  I got a mug at the end of the night.  But you taking her to Scarface would be like De Niro taking what's-her-face to see that  porno movie in Taxi Driver.  Oh, no.  Wait.  Diane Keaton or Sybil Shepard.  Sybil Shepard.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, but a four should...  I should have put my foot down on a four.  Absolutely.  If she was a nine, then you go, all right, look, you got to take the bullet and go see Yentl.  A four, you should have treated like fucking Tony's sister at the end of the movie.  Yeah.  Killed her.  That's a good story if you got blown, though. 
[01:40:30]  If you took her to see Yentl and you fucking came in her ugly mouth, that's worth it.  Nothing.  You should have said, we're going to see Scarface.  Like, no, not even...  Scarface is playing.  We're going.  You know?  Yeah.  Did you enjoy Yentl?  Horrendous.  Fucking one of the worst things I've ever seen.  It wasn't good?  Did you watch it again and get on tape or anything?  Never watched it again.  Oh.  The only thing worse was...  I can't even remember that movie.  Shit.  I don't know.  That Clint Eastwood movie that he did, Bridges of Madison County. 
[01:41:00]  You saw it?  Yeah.  I never saw all that.  That was another bullet I took.  It was bad?  Yeah.  A girl wanted to see it?  Yeah.  You didn't?  No.  I tell my wife these stories.  She's like, now you won't even think about watching one movie.  I'm like, I know.  Well, I fucking changed.  Other people ruined it for you.  Yeah, you learned.  She's like, you saw that movie.  Yeah, I saw that one, too.  You saw that?  You saw Fool's Rush In with Salma Hayek.  I'm like, yeah, I thought she was hot.  I had a fucking crush on her.  I'd see anything she was in.  But all those other women ruined it for your wife. 
[01:41:30]  They did.  Because now you all go see she.  Yeah, they totally did.  You remember my ex that I used to live with?  Oh, God, yeah.  The Spanish one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she always wanted to see romantic comedies.  And I used to go all the time.  I'm like, all right, fine.  Yeah.  And then we'd go see an action flick, because I like the action flicks.  Right.  You know, we'd both take the bullet.  But I'd sit there, and all that garbage.  The Meg Ryan's.  You never warmed up to it?  One of her favorite movies was When a Man Loves a Woman.  I know you hate that.  I hated the fucking AA scene at the end, where he makes that cunty speech, and all the people  in the program are like, wow. 
[01:42:00]  Like 12-step people would listen to this jerk-off and be amazed by his love.  Like, oh, fuck yourself.  Shut up.  What was one rom-com that you were like, actually, this is pretty good?  The Woodsman.  Yeah.  The Woodsman was great.  Love that movie.  None.  Never won.  Yeah, because Fool's Rush In wasn't exactly Dusk Till Dawn, was it?  No, that was terrible.  Yeah.  Is there one out there?  A rom-com that's okay.  That you were like, oh, actually, I kind of enjoyed that one. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I'm sure.  I've seen some that I liked that were funny.  Or even a romance movie.  Like, Bridges of Madison County wasn't a rom-com.  That was a romance movie.  What's a romance film that was good?  Like The Notebook.  I never saw The Notebook.  I hear, I have scumbag friends that actually say it's a good movie.  Really?  That would never, never in a million years like a movie like that, but I've never seen it.  Yeah, I saw it.  I didn't like it, but.  What's a romantic film?  On Golden Pond's not a romantic film, but there is, I mean, it is about two people in 
[01:43:00]  love at the end of their life, but it's also about, eh.  Yeah.  But that's a movie I didn't think I'd like.  I saw that in the theater, and I absolutely loved it.  True romance.  True romance.  True romance is your favorite romantic movie?  Yeah, they're in love the whole movie.  That's a good, that's a good romantic movie.  I can't think of it.  See, I like that happy ending.  Right.  They get the money, they're on the island, or whatever, yeah.  That's okay, that happy ending.  Yeah, because he's missing an eye.  It's like, eh, that's all right.  Yeah, right, because horrible things happened, it just didn't happen at the end, so you're  okay with it. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never would have named my son Elvis.  She was so fucking sexy in that.  Oh, yeah.  Hook her on her third date, I would have fucking tried to rescue her, too.  I never would have went and got her shit, though.  No, that was a ball.  Why would you do that?  Terrible.  Yeah.  And then leave your, one of my favorite moments in true romance is when Christopher Walken  is telling Hopper, and he goes, your son, fuckhead that he is, and he covers  it's like, he spits a little bit of that.  Yeah.  That was such a great moment.  Yeah.  Fuckhead that he is.  Leaves his license. 
[01:44:00]  What about Galifino Boss?  You're going to be happy, because he finds a number.  Oh, my God.  He finds a number in the refrigerator.  Fucking James Gandolfini.  I remember when he died.  That's how he got the role in Sopranos, from that part.  Oh, really?  From, what's his face?  Seeing him as a mobster.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Seeing how good he was.  David Chase?  Yeah, he was phenomenal.  Yeah.  In true romance as that fucking mobster.  The first time you killed somebody, I got sick.  What, he's sitting in that chair, and she's laying on the floor, all bloody, and he's  telling Storr, you want to play? 
[01:44:30]  Come on, let's play.  Yeah.  I was thinking about the Sopranos the other night, how he was very unlikable in a lot  of those.  Tony?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You rooted for him, and you loved him, but I was thinking of all the scumbag things he  did.  I'm like, man, Tony did a lot of scumbag things in the Sopranos.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It really made him hard to like.  He went through long periods on that show where he was not likable.  Like, he was a bad dude.  Very realistic painting of a man, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember when he died, we announced he died.  I felt like crying in studio.  I didn't, but like, everyone in the studio opened, it was like, we all wanted to just 
[01:45:00]  cry.  It was fucking awful.  Because of the way we attached ourselves to that character.  Yeah.  And how I remind a lot of people of him with my, you know, authoritative masculine.  Is that right?  No.  I didn't think so.  Tony Soprano probably would never watch Lifetime one night with ice cream by himself.  Yes, he would have.  He cried over the ducks.  I'm telling you, he would have, but then he would have talked about it in therapy.  Yeah.  He would have watched that, but then he would have thought he was a fag.  He loved the History Channel, not Lifetime.  So, should we break? 
[01:45:30]  I got a piss.  Yeah, actually, the author, I think he checked in.  Oh, is he already?  Yeah, so if you want to...  Oh, I didn't know he was at 8 o'clock.  Take a break.  Oh, I thought he was supposed to be 8.30.  No?  He is.  He's early.  Oh, okay.  Let's, a couple of quick plugs for myself and James.  First of all, this Friday and Saturday, October 18th and 19th, I'm on my way out doing material.  I'm doing the Lancaster.  For the first time in years, I'm doing the Stitches Comedy Club.  I had great success this weekend in Doylestown.  It's new material.  It's not completely put together, but it's fun. 
[01:46:00]  I'm telling the audience what I'm doing.  The tickets are cheaper.  And then I'm in Rochester next weekend, October 25th, 26th, in the Comedy Club.  And Dice and I, Dice and I are not sold out in the Beacon.  And I was like, what the fuck is going on?  Because it's a great show.  And then I realized, we are there, it's November 1st, the night after Halloween.  The night after, and plus you've got the New York Comedy Festival in town.  The week after.  The week after, where there's a million shows going on.  Well, that I knew, and I was like, it's going to be a slower sell, because we're competing  with, you know, Bill Burrs at the fucking... 
[01:46:30]  There's so many people doing so many shows.  But I'm like, why not that night?  You know, we're doing good, but we should be sold out.  The night after fucking Halloween.  So a lot of people have Halloween shit going.  But at least try to plan this.  It's an 8 o'clock show.  And there's one thing I want to plug this weekend, because I will be away.  There's a Cancer Sucks benefit here in New York.  Otto and George are on it.  Bob Levy's on it.  Big Jay Oakerson.  It's an excellent show.  Saturday the 19th at 2 p.m.  It's an afternoon show.  Because I think that's the only time they could get the venue.  At the Bitter End, here in New York, on Bleecker Street. 
[01:47:00]  And it's to support one of our good fans who's got cancer.  They're trying to help him out.  So you can go to brownpapertickets.com and just search for Cancer Sucks.  And, you know, try to help this guy out and see a kick-ass show.  I'm sure Otto will have some fucking horrible things to say.  But it's a show I wish I could be a part of.  And, Jimmy, what do you got?  October 17th through 19th this week, Comedy Works in Montreal.  October 25th, 26th, New Hope Cinema in New Hope, Minnesota.  And then November 1 and 2, The Joke Factory in Rochester, New York. 
[01:47:30]  Artie Fletcher opened the room up there.  Oh, did he?  Okay, cool.  Yeah, so I'll be up there.  Yeah, and that's it.  And my podcast is out today.  I've interviewed Metallica.  It's on my new podcast, Comedy Metal Midgets.  Did you get all of them?  Yeah, I got all of them, yeah.  How'd you get it?  Well, it was part of a special I did for the movie where I, yeah, it's a long story.  But, yeah, I got all of them.  Just basically talking about the movie.  You were in the room with all of them?  No.  Oh.  Originally, I was supposed to fly out to San Francisco to interview them.  But instead, to get all four of them together, which you had a big problem with, they finally got them. 
[01:48:00]  They go, you just come up with all the questions.  We'll ask them.  And then it's your interview.  So they had their manager do it, even though I came up with the questions.  And we pieced it together as a radio special.  Oh, okay.  It was a podcast, yeah.  That's great.  But they wanted me to do it.  I just, we couldn't work it together.  We're all four.  We're together.  People love your podcast, man.  I get a lot of, like, retweets or whatever.  Like, they say that you had an amazing podcast.  So, and you can get an iTunes.  Yeah, you guys play them every, like, third weekend here.  Oh, we do?  Okay.  Yeah, so it's great.  I just played this weekend. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, a lot of people compare our chip, your chip character to my beat.  I go, look, we're just, we've hung out.  We've known each other since 1990.  And we just, that's just the way we talk.  Nobody took it from anybody.  No one took it.  Yeah, Florentine was Florentine long before Chip existed.  I'll clear this up.  Because Jim, like, Chip is like this.  Like, what's up?  It's not a takeoff on Jim at all.  It's something I would do to annoy my girlfriend.  Yeah, and mine is just like, really?  You like healthy football?  That Jim has been doing that before I knew it.  See, that's a cross between, like, a retarded guy and Dice. 
[01:49:00]  When Dice does the girl voice.  That's my, like, man caves.  What's that?  Yeah, see, and then Chip is...  What are you talking about or something?  Yeah, see, that's a, it's totally different.  It's the subtleties, too.  Chip, his upper lip covers his entire front row of teeth, whereas Florentine's guy, his  front teeth are completely on display.  Yeah, my, yeah, my, yeah.  What's that?  All right, whatever.  You sound stupid.  You sound stupid.  Fucking idiot.  We got a sign on our man cave.  What happens in the man cave stays in the man cave.  That's fucking hilarious.  See, it's not, neither is taking from either, but Jim was Jim. 
[01:49:30]  But they get along.  Jim was Jim long before.  So, if anything, Chip came second.  No, no.  I still can't see an Applebee's without fucking, I literally, me and Kenny this weekend, because  every fucking shit town I'm in, there's a bunch of them.  Applebee's.  You see what Applebee's are?  Yeah.  Applebee's.  It's a neighborhood bar and grill.  Yeah, it's fun.  Yeah, it's fun.  Applebee's.  You feel like you're in the neighborhood.  Yeah, you guys want to go to Applebee's.  That's all me and Kenny will say in the car.  I don't feel like I'm in your neighborhood.  What is the slogan?  I don't know.  Eating good in the neighborhood.  Eating good in the neighborhood. 
[01:50:00]  Applebee.  No, I'm not.  I'd rather eat one of fucking Jim Norton's fucking prostitute logs than land on his chest.  You and Jim Norton both.  All right, we'll be back.  Henry Bushkin, I guess, is checking in early.  And I'm going to take a leak and I have to do a quick break.  And I'm going to read this well.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  You ever worry about missing your favorite TV shows because your DVR is full?  That happened to me when I was taping Tough Crowd years ago. 
[01:50:30]  When I was on, I would tape every one on a DVR and be frustrated when I missed them because  I didn't realize it was gobbling them up.  Most DVRs do not give you the space that you need.  That's the truth.  Well, luckily, you can get the Hopper from Dish with enough DVR storage to record and save  all of your favorites.  But the Hopper lets you store up to 2,000 hours of shows, movies, sports, and more.  So there's no need to worry about what to delete.  2,000 hours.  My DVR sucked back in the day.  You can keep it all and get this.  When you enable the Hopper's auto-hop feature, what is the F-eacher? 
[01:51:00]  Is that what it's called or are they just spelling feature out?  I guess they're spelling feature.  I know how to spell, to say feature, you zilches, unless that's how it's called.  The auto-hop feature.  You can watch primetime network recordings, commercial-free.  Unlike DVRs, there's no fast-forwarding required.  You can spend time watching your shows without those annoying interruptions.  Call 1-800-WATCH-TV today to get all the DVR storage space you could ever need and interruption-free 
[01:51:30]  entertainment only with the Hopper from Dish.  That's 1-800-WATCH-TV.  This way you're not going to lose things the way I lost all of my Tough Crowd episodes  when they just started cannibalizing.  That's 1-800-WATCH-TV.  The Hopper from Dish.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  Go on, sit down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more. 
[01:52:00]  Our guest has, our first guest has arrived.  Yeah.  And now you bring him in.  Hendry.  Let me move this.  Hello, sir.  We're on the air.  Oh, yeah.  Keep your phone.  Now, that was a professional.  Hendry was trying to hand his phone to Travis.  Travis is like, no, keep it.  Don't trust him.  He'll go throw it.  How are you guys?  Nice to be here.  Which, incidentally, handing your phone over. 
[01:52:30]  Very brave.  You must have nothing to hide, because I would never just hand my phone to somebody.  Nothing.  Are you password protected?  Password protected.  Oh, okay.  Totally protected.  Condoms, everything.  Are you using condoms?  That's another thing I don't happen to agree with.  I think they're overrated.  Well, welcome to the show.  You smell good.  Thank you.  You wear a good cologne.  I guess we're here to talk about your book.  I hope so.  I hope so.  No, it's condoms.  It's smelling good.  Yeah, imagine if I only asked about your cologne and your password.  I just tried to get your password out of you.  I finished your book last night. 
[01:53:00]  It was excellent.  Thank you.  And I guess to start, you were Carson's lawyer from what years?  1970 through 1988.  What type of lawyer-client confidence do you have where you're able to write a book?  What is the law on that?  Don't you have to sign non-disclosures?  Well, the law is that the attorney-client privilege ceases with death.  So it ceases with death.  It's as simple as that. 
[01:53:30]  Okay.  How do you think he would feel about this book?  Would he feel betrayed?  I think he would feel delighted that people are talking about him again.  I think that's the real thing here, that this is a renaissance, hopefully, for Johnny.  He deserves it.  He's looked at by, I think, every comedian today as the gold standard.  And I think if this book helps, in part, serve that renaissance, I think it's a good thing.  And you pointed out, too, that you met him under very odd circumstances through a friend 
[01:54:00]  who you were going to help with.  What exactly was it you were brought on to help him with?  I was brought on to help him look into an apartment that he thought his wife had.  That was simply my job, to go there, to be the lawyer in case something happened, nothing more.  You mean that this is Joanne Carson, who he lived with and was married to,  had an apartment set up somewhere else?  That's correct.  And that was a big story in the post. 
[01:54:30]  They've actually been talking about your book a lot, where she was allegedly fucking Frank Gifford.  Right.  And that was what was at least alleged.  Well, again, that chapter, that was just a fact.  It wasn't the point of the chapter at all.  It had to do with how I met Johnny.  And the scene at the bar at the end of that chapter was the big reveal in that chapter,  giving me a whole lowdown on his personality, his psyche, his sense of tragedy, 
[01:55:00]  because it was at that moment that it was a tragic moment.  Well, can you walk us through that a little bit, just because it was very interesting to me  that your second day of knowing this guy or whatever,  you're walking to a secret apartment that his wife has that he thinks she is sharing with someone else.  And he's almost brought, he was the host of The Tonight Show,  and he brought you into this very private moment relatively quickly.  No question.  It was shocking to me, and I think it was shocking to everybody who knew me 
[01:55:30]  that Johnny Carson actually hired me to do something.  What did you see when you got into that apartment that she was allegedly having with Frank Giverd?  Well, you say allegedly. I was there.  Okay, I don't know how to use the word allegedly.  I don't know what to write. Okay, but she had with Giverd. Cool.  I'm not subscribing anything to you, but I was there.  Again, the apartment and the incident in the apartment,  taking some evidence, taking photos and leaving,  was simply, you know, one of those moments that 30 years later you could have fun with it. 
[01:56:00]  30 years ago is tragic, however long it was.  So tragedy, a lot of years you get some comedy.  So I intended it to be lighthearted in that sense,  because it was 43 years ago.  I mean, who cares? This is 43 years ago.  So all the hubbubaloo in the papers is shocking to me.  I'm fascinated by it, because again, the point of this chapter was not Joanne Carson and an illicit apartment. 
[01:56:30]  It just happened to be the basis, how I met the guy.  Simply that.  It is interesting, though, because of the fact that we saw Carson.  He was one of my idols growing up.  We see him one way.  He's Johnny of The Tonight Show.  You got so close.  I don't know if it's harder for you to realize how little of him most of us know,  but you talk about him carrying a pistol and breaking down and crying there,  realizing his wife is probably having an affair.  Like, that's a big thing for people to read about a guy like Johnny Carson. 
[01:57:00]  Well, I listened to your question.  Probably having an affair is probably an understatement.  So you think she was fucking his brains out?  Why? Because there was clothes in the closet and pictures of him on the wall?  Things like that.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Photographs.  Clues.  Taking evidence.  We did our job.  Let's put it that way.  We did our job.  I had a job to do.  I did it.  I never thought about it again until I wrote the book, to tell you the truth.  It was not something that I ever spoke about,  because it was one of those moments that you just don't want to tell people about. 
[01:57:30]  And so, again, 43 years after the event, I think you could have some fun with it.  Sorry that Joanne Carson isn't, but what can I say?  Well, yeah, Joanne's denying it, and then Frank Gifford says,  I can't remember if that happened or not.  Well, you choose.  Right.  And then Joanne said that Johnny would have never had a gun.  He wasn't into guns at all.  Johnny would.  And from the day I met him, he carried a gun, and I knew him for 18 years.  So what more could I say about that? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  You know, for a fact, he had it.  I believe that he had it.  And there's a reason for him to have it.  Well, again, I was there, and you know, I'm not alleging something.  I'm telling you what the facts were.  That's your experience.  And he did carry a gun.  He was the subject of such intense scrutiny by everybody when they saw him.  And there was one incident that I wrote about where he was subject to an extortion attempt.  And he wouldn't let the cops make the drop.  He insisted on doing it. 
[01:58:30]  And if you don't think he had his .38 on the seat of that car, you've got to be kidding.  Right.  With the cops, with the FBI, with every agency you could think of looking on, this is who he was.  He had brass balls when it came to that.  And you told a story, too, which was great, about that night in the bar, which was after this happens.  And you're sitting there, and he's just kind of spilling his guts to you.  And what do you think it was about you that got a guy who was so private among so many people to just look at you and go, this is the guy I'm going to start telling all this stuff to? 
[01:59:00]  I don't know that he saw anything in me, but I could tell you that at that point in his life, he had very few people, if anybody, that he could turn to and rely on.  His life was a mess in 1970.  There's no question about it.  His marriage was bad.  He was drinking.  He had problems with his manager.  He had problems with the show.  He had a number of different things going on and nobody to turn to.  And so I was the guy who just happened to be there. 
[01:59:30]  Maybe you call it just very, very lucky.  Right circumstances, right timing, and I was there.  Did he ever miss a show from drinking too much, from partying, because it seemed like he had a major alcohol problem?  Again, I met him in 1970, and the drinking was mostly in the late 60s with Ed McMahon when they were running around in New York.  When he moved to California in 1972, most of that had subsided pretty well.  And he got married, and that sort of calmed him down for quite some time. 
[02:00:00]  So it wasn't like he was loaded all the time?  No, no, no, not at all.  And I didn't mean to suggest that.  Some reports have said that.  It's just not true.  He drank.  A lot of people drink.  A lot of people get loaded on occasion.  And most of the crazy stories come out when people are loaded, so that's what, yeah.  You bet.  And that's what you hear about today, but don't forget back then, no phones, no cell phones, no cameras, no paparazzi hanging around when we were inside a place. 
[02:00:30]  So we were very comfortable, and you could drink.  I mean, they did.  I mean, it's as simple as that.  Lots of people did.  Do you remember the, I watched the Dorothy Stratton interview with that old player.  Do you know who she was?  No.  Oh, okay, so you won't remember.  I was going to ask you a question about it, but it doesn't matter.  She was a Playboy model who was murdered by her husband not long after Carson.  Johnny had nothing to do with it, nor did I.  Yeah, yeah, no, no, yeah.  And it wasn't because of the interview.  She didn't say anything that got her shot.  Do you remember, now the Joan Rivers thing, of course you remember, but that's, for some reason, people took a very harsh view of Johnny Carson from that. 
[02:01:00]  Like, oh, he's this cold-hearted son of a bitch, and how could he not wish her well?  And, you know, what do you think people got wrong about that?  Well, as you describe it, everything.  He never received a call from her or her husband, nor did I, telling Johnny or me that she was going to do this.  His point of view after the fact was if she had come to me, if she had asked me, I would have wished her well. 
[02:01:30]  I would have said, good luck.  And the fact that she was going in competition against him didn't bother him, because his point of view was Joan Rivers was sensational, but no more than one week at a time.  You put her on two weeks at a time, it's too much.  You put her on three weeks at a time, too much.  And he was right.  And I could assure you that if she did that and the show failed, he would have welcomed her back.  Yeah, wouldn't he interview people that had gone up against him, like, who was it, Cabot, or a few other guys who flopped and he'd have them on the show? 
[02:02:00]  Look, he was as smart as anybody.  Radio's a business, television's a business.  His line was if a gorilla could do his job, they'd replace him with a gorilla, because he'd be cheaper.  Right.  And it's true.  So Joan Rivers was a terrific guest host, maybe the best, and she screwed him by not letting him know.  And there's stories out there that her husband supposedly called me, which didn't happen. 
[02:02:30]  And frankly, I attribute the whole mess to her husband, because he was a secretive guy and he was a difficult guy.  And I think that's the cause of the problem.  He told her, he called me, he never did, she was satisfied, she did what she did, and then Johnny got supremely aggravated and never spoke to her again.  It's as simple as that.  Because she told a story, too, where she, and that makes sense, that the husband probably told her that just because he knew it was a career move for her and that she'd never be able to take over for Carson. 
[02:03:00]  And did she try to call him, like, did Johnny, he didn't call her or send her anything when Edgar committed suicide?  And didn't she call when Rick had died and he just wouldn't respond to it?  Well, when Rick died, I was no longer representing him, so I can't tell you what happened when Rick died.  After the incident with Joan taking her show, as far as I knew, as long as I was there, he never spoke to her, and he never would. 
[02:03:30]  Now, maybe, if he were alive today, he might have a change of heart, but not then.  He wasn't that type of guy.  Once you were out of his life, that was it.  He severed relationships fairly quickly and completely.  I'm not sure that they were fairly quickly, but when he did, it was over.  It was, he didn't have any remorse.  He just didn't, and that wasn't in his psyche.  The documentary on him was great recently. 
[02:04:00]  I think there's a really renewed interest in Carson for some reason.  I hope that was the beginning of sort of a renaissance.  This book was written long before that PBS special was put on.  Indeed, the producer tried to get me on a number of different times, all of which I refused,  simply because I didn't want to talk about him.  I really didn't.  And this book came out really almost as a result of that show because I felt all the  warts were sort of exposed in that show. 
[02:04:30]  And this book of mine put some meat on the bones of what people were talking about.  So I don't have any regrets about this.  And after that PBS special, Johnny would have been, I think, delighted today that people are  talking about him.  I think that's basically the bottom line.  Did he enjoy fame?  Like, did he like being famous?  Well, when he did The Tonight Show in those days, when he walked out on stage, everybody  in the audience stood up and applauded. 
[02:05:00]  Now, you know, that's a hard act to follow.  When you go home, everybody has stood up and the wife meets you with some plumbing problems.  It's hard to adjust to that.  And so the fame that he had was such that it was very difficult for him to sort of be  a normal person immediately.  Leave the show and all of a sudden become a normal person.  It wasn't that easy. 
[02:05:30]  What would you guys do on the road?  Because I didn't ever realize that Carson did gigs.  Like, I never realized that he went out and did road gigs up until 1980.  And you said he played Vegas and he played clubs.  And what was that like being on the road, his kind of routine for a gig?  Well, Vegas was basically, he would finish The Tonight Show on a Friday night.  The two of us would drive to Burbank Airport, where his plane would pick us up, take us to  Las Vegas in about 40 minutes. 
[02:06:00]  And by the time the opening act, Phyllis McGuire was done.  He was well into his act.  He was comfortable.  Did two shows, Friday and Saturday.  And in those days, he was making a quarter of a million a weekend for two shows.  And what year was that, that he was making a quarter, 125,000 a show?  This was 1980.  Wow.  So, 1980, he's making that amount of money.  And, you know, by today's standards, almost, it doesn't seem like a lot, you know, because 
[02:06:30]  you could have an Eagles concert.  Yeah.  They could gross two million a night, you know, so 250.  But then, it was more than Sinatra was making, okay?  It was.  It was more than Sinatra was making, because with Johnny, there was no expenses.  You know, I mean, Johnny was in one, they had the house orchestra with his band leader,  and an opening act, which consisted of Phyllis McGuire, and it was a simple show. 
[02:07:00]  It was cheap, you know, very cheap, and it was always packed.  So, in those days, I would say he was probably the highest paid performer in Las Vegas as well.  And he was doing roughly 10 weekends a year.  So, multiply that, it's two and a half million for 20 days.  Not bad.  Was he doing monologue jokes, like an hour of just jokes, or was it a variety show?  No, no, he was in one.  He was purely in one, in front of the curtain for 90 minutes. 
[02:07:30]  So, he was maybe the best stand-up in one you've ever seen.  And, hopefully, one day we'll be able to recreate that in another form.  But he was brilliant.  Was he a stand-up before?  Because, like everybody knows, Leno Letterman, they were pure stand-ups.  Carson, I always just thought of as a TV host.  But had he done stand-up before?  No.  You've got to understand, guys, he started in television in 1949, okay?  There was no stand-up in 1949.  There was radio, and then there was television, you know? 
[02:08:00]  And there was, like, small clubs that you could play.  But he was basically doing magician-type of work before that, right?  So, he was doing radio, then he did television.  So, he didn't do any stand-up.  His act came about as a result of doing The Tonight Show.  The other guys had an act before they did The Tonight Show.  His act after that.  After that kind of came from doing it.  Yeah.  But, I have to tell you, anybody who's seen him, okay, you could ask Wayne Newton, who 
[02:08:30]  was a brilliant, you know, Las Vegas performer.  Ask Wayne Newton, who didn't particularly like Johnny, how good he was as a performer.  He was brilliant.  Yeah, did he really, did he threaten to kick Carson's ass?  Oh, yeah, I think he did.  I wasn't at the studio at the time, but I've spoken to Wayne about it.  And what did he say?  And, well, it all stemmed from Johnny making Wayne Newton gay jokes.  And after a while...  I didn't know it was a gay joke.  Yeah, it was Wayne Newton gay jokes.  On The Tonight Show or in his live act? 
[02:09:00]  On The Tonight Show.  No, no.  This was on The Tonight Show.  So, Wayne is a big guy.  Part Indian.  Rough guy.  Lives in Las Vegas.  He's a horseman.  And a nice guy.  But these two were vying for the Aladdin Hotel at one point.  And we dropped out for various reasons.  The FBI suggested we drop out.  We did drop out.  Wayne Newton got the hotel, the Aladdin Hotel. 
[02:09:30]  It was in bankruptcy.  And Johnny got pissed that he was getting all the publicity that he beat out Carson.  When he didn't beat out Carson, we dropped out.  But the press said he beat out Carson.  So Carson got pissed and hence Wayne Newton gay jokes.  And so Wayne went to NBC?  Well, again, I wasn't there.  So this is what Wayne tells me.  I believe it happened after I left, by the way.  So I believe it happened, but I can't really validate. 
[02:10:00]  But he must have been like, what the fuck's Wayne Newton doing here?  I think so.  And what was the, another thing that got a lot of press that you wrote about was, there  was a genuine mob hit on Carson put out way back in the early 70s or late 60s?  Right here in New York, Johnny and Ed out drinking one night at Chili's and try to pick up two 
[02:10:30]  girls at the bar.  They happened to be the wife of and the sister of one of the members of the, let's say, a  notorious gang family here in New York, unbeknownst to Johnny.  Well, the windup was after Jilly got him out of there, he was told that the husband was  out to get him, that he was going to kill him because of what Johnny had done. 
[02:11:00]  Now, basically, Johnny hid out, or I can't say hid out, he just didn't leave the house.  He just didn't leave UN Plaza.  And Dave Tevitt, who was an NBC executive, called up, after hearing all this, called up  his buddy at William Morris, who dealt with what we call bent noses, guys who, he had a  relationship with some people in that family.  And because it was the Italian-American, it was Columbus Day, it was actually Columbus 
[02:11:30]  Day today, that they were having an Italian-American parade, and nobody would cover it.  No network would cover it, simply because it was basically the mafia saying, we're good  guys.  You know, so they organized the parade.  So, they would, NBC was told, you cover the parade, if you cover the parade, we'll let  Carson off the hook.  So, if you go back, you'll find NBC was the only network that carried that parade, and 
[02:12:00]  Carson then went back to work.  They threw him down a flight of stairs, too, when they found out?  Well, that was before the threat.  Before the threat, like that night when they found out he was hitting on the girls.  Well, some other guys did that, okay, who happened to be around, okay, then the husband  came.  Johnny, by that time, had left.  I'm sorry, Jim.  And Johnny, did he not do the Tonight Show for the next few nights?  Three nights.  Three nights, he missed the show because of this.  Wow.  So, he took it very seriously.  I would have, too. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Now, did the guy want to kill him just because he hit on his wife, or was he rude about it?  Because if he didn't know she was married, I mean...  Well, I don't think he knew very much.  I think he was pretty loaded, and I don't know what went on, obviously, but it was serious  enough that it was taken seriously by the husband, who was out to get Johnny for, you  know, for a couple of days.  And his...  I love hearing stories about his mother, because it's...  You know, you wouldn't think that Carson would be intimidated or alpha, whatever, by 
[02:13:00]  anybody, but his mother really was a ruffle.  And she was what I would describe as Midwestern gothic, very cold, very sort of aloof.  You knew her?  Very well.  And always polite and always considerate and actually quite charming.  But, you know, that doesn't mean that that was the relationship she had with her son or  other children, for that matter.  And he never could get any love from her, any warmth from her. 
[02:13:30]  Indeed, the PBS special that we spoke about talked about her being in the green room and  saying to her son, John, you weren't very funny tonight.  I mean, I mean, come on.  And he sent his parents on a 47-day trip around the world and gave them a gold American Express  card before they left and said to his father, Dad, anything you want, wherever you stop,  put it on the card, it's on me.  So, in 47 days, they never bothered to call him to say, we're having a great time, we're 
[02:14:00]  doing this, we're doing that.  47 days, doesn't hear from them.  And when they finally get home and he finally calls them, she tells him, John, we're so happy  to be home.  Not a word about we had a great time.  We had, I mean, anything normal that you would expect.  A postcard, anything.  A hello?  Nothing.  So, that's prototypical of his mother and that's, I think, a good reveal on why he was who he 
[02:14:30]  was.  It was very difficult for him to express any sort of emotion because of her.  But his dad seemed like he couldn't have been too terrific either because he also could have  picked up a phone.  The dad was completely, completely under the thumb of the mom.  I mean, she ruled the roost.  The dad didn't do anything without checking with his wife.  It was one of the, I mean, you guys all know circumstances like that.  That happened to be the Carson family. 
[02:15:00]  The father would say virtually nothing and a very elegant guy, shocking crop of white  hair, good looking guy.  But the mom, she ruled the roost.  And there's obviously, Carson was, you forget how handsome he was.  Like, he was a good looking dude.  Like, you look back at the old footage of him.  So, there was obviously a lot of women around.  Well, in those days, there were a lot of women around every, every star in those days.  Carson was no different. 
[02:15:30]  I mean, you know, I mean, the book is certainly about Johnny.  But do you think he was any different than Sinatra?  I don't think so.  Or Bob Hope?  No.  Or Jack Banny?  Or any of the greats of that period?  Or even before him?  They were all alike.  They all drank.  They all caroused.  I mean, there are exceptions, of course.  But he was no different.  And you obviously got a little bit of the, the benefit of that, I would hope.  Being the friend, you know, you're there all the time.  There's got to be always at least one friend with a girl. 
[02:16:00]  Well, occasionally, that was true.  Yeah.  And there were probably hot chicks, too.  There probably wasn't any fat ones hanging out.  No, no fat ones.  Nice.  No fat ones.  I remember a line that Johnny had one night.  We were sitting at the bar, and I thought it was like either the best line I ever heard  or the cruelest.  This woman came in, obviously, with her daughter.  And it was obviously the daughter, you know, that had, that had the looks that we were interested in.  But the mom came along, so Johnny looked at the mom. 
[02:16:30]  And these two were just thrilled to be sitting, you know, at the same table as Johnny Carson.  He looked at the mother, and he said, I'm so sorry you lost your last fight.  And I said, did he say that to her?  Did he say, I'm so sorry you lost your last fight?  And they sort of laughed, and then it took you like five minutes to realize what he actually said.  But it was so kind of...  That she was ugly.  It was so kind of, she never got it. 
[02:17:00]  She never got it.  And I'm saying, wow, what a line to use on somebody.  That's the best line, not cruel.  Did he wind up banging the door?  I'm not sure.  So, how did your relationship with him end?  Well, it ended, I'd say, quickly, and sort of very much in line with how relationships with him ended.  It was like a three-minute conversation.  We shook hands.  This was at his Malibu residence, and I left. 
[02:17:30]  That was the end of the sort of the official lawyer relationship.  The relationship went on another six or seven months, you know, on a variety of different things,  including some matters that were sort of very touchy that I was handling.  Right.  That he didn't want me turning over to the other lawyer, but it really involved his son in Florida. 
[02:18:00]  So, there was another lawyer involved.  So, I kept in touch for about another eight months, and that was it.  Did you ever feel in the relationship that it was going to end badly,  because it happened with a lot of other past relationships, like, man, if I screw up one time,  I'm going to be out just like everybody else, including, like, Joan Rivers and other people in his life?  At many times, I'm certain I felt that way, but practically, you know, we were partners in many respects.  So, it just couldn't end that way, like it did with Joan Rivers. 
[02:18:30]  There were much more, it's like a marriage that you had to sort of unravel in certain respects.  But, yeah, it's very quick, and it's pretty much final.  He, as I said earlier, he doesn't go back and rethink these things.  It's over.  I kind of admire that, even though maybe he's made some shitty decisions.  I wish I had that ability.  I just keep people hanging on, and I still talk to exes.  I wish I could just fucking cut her.  It's a coldness.  You know, you've got to understand, if you're not sort of brutally cold in that sense, 
[02:19:00]  it's hard to imagine, you know, breaking a relationship with a wife and never speaking to her again.  I mean, just never.  And that was the interesting thing about Joanne Carson, because he never spoke to her again,  at least in the 18 years that I represented him, and she talks in interviews as if she spoke to him every day.  So, that's also kind of interesting to me.  I thought it was, what a dumb thing he did that you tried to advise him against when he was marrying Joanna.  You had a prenup, and he just decided not to have a prenup. 
[02:19:30]  Like, for what?  It was gallantry.  I think he felt, don't forget, this was 1972, and prenups are not like they are today in California.  They're almost, like, required.  It's almost like, even if you have nothing, you almost get a prenup when you get married.  So, then it was very much sort of avant-garde, almost.  And he felt, I think, that it was not a great way to start the marriage. 
[02:20:00]  So, you've got to commend him for that.  I mean, it may have been silly, but you really have to commend sort of the gallantry of that.  How'd that work out financially in the end?  Well, let's put it this way.  He died worth almost $500 million.  So, what difference does it make?  Well, did you get a lot of...  It cost him about $35 million.  But, you know, in the end of the day, when you think about it, it's almost like, so what?  But, you know, even if you're worth half a billion, there's no way anyone can be happy with $35 million. 
[02:20:30]  Especially when he finds out that she's having an affair.  No, different woman.  Oh, this is Joanna.  This is Joanna.  All right, right, that's right.  This is wife number three.  Right, right.  Yeah, this is Joanna.  There was four wives, right?  Then he remarried again later in his life.  Yes.  And, yeah, he said that little gesture cost him $35 million, which is just...  Or, as he would say to me, listen, the next time I want to get married, find me some woman I don't like, and I'll give her a house, and I'll be done with it. 
[02:21:00]  Good line, right?  Yeah.  And you didn't seem to care for his last wife.  I just got that vibe reading what you wrote.  You know, I really didn't know her very well.  I certainly wouldn't say I didn't like her at all.  I mean, she was very nice.  Okay.  She was a wife that I describe as she could have been a legal secretary.  She could have been a great real estate agent.  She could have been an administrative assistant. 
[02:21:30]  Very attractive.  And in Los Angeles, there are lots of very attractive women like that.  And so what I said is she could have been anybody.  She just happened to be like me at the right place at the right time to see him when he was completely single, if you will.  And that was his fourth wife.  And, again, my relationship with him ended very soon after that marriage began. 
[02:22:00]  Now, if you said, well, was she a contributing factor?  I couldn't answer that, you know.  But perhaps.  I just don't know.  Well, he accused you.  I know you guys had Carson Productions.  And we're trying to.  He wanted to unload it.  And I guess they wanted $100 million for it.  And you didn't think it would get $100 million.  So you had spoken to somebody about possibly getting $60 million.  And you wanted more, but they offered $60 million. 
[02:22:30]  And you had a deal with it.  And he thought you were trying.  You and Ed Weinberger were trying to take the company out from under him.  That's my understanding.  I didn't speak to him directly about it.  But actually, he did.  In our three-minute meeting, he did tell me that, that I was trying to steal the company from him.  Now that you mention it.  And what happened, it was an offer that I brought to his investment bankers.  They were representing his company.  And that was the reason that we broke up our relationship. 
[02:23:00]  I wanted to build the company.  He wanted to end the company.  And so the company that we had created, the investment bankers were asking $100 million.  The offer that I received was $60 million.  Because they wanted Ed Weinberger and myself to come along with the company.  Would you have left Carson to do that?  I was already gone.  So certainly I would have left because I had left.  Why did he want to sell a company? 
[02:23:30]  He didn't want it anymore.  He wanted to just do the Tonight Show.  That was the reason that we broke up.  In effect, as a business guy, I'm trying to build something.  And the more success we had, the less he liked it.  The more time I spent on the business and not on him, the less he liked it.  So we were going at that point in opposite directions.  Our goals had diverged at some point.  Why did he not want that business? 
[02:24:00]  Simply because the only thing he wanted in life was to do the Tonight Show.  As it turns out, he had no ambitions beyond the Tonight Show.  That was sad as far as I was concerned.  Because the intuitive thing that we as business guys do, you try to build something.  You don't try to not build it.  You try to build it.  You don't try to destroy it.  And so what we had built up, he said to me one day, sell it.  And I said, we've got 100 people working for us. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, you just don't stop and sell it.  He said, no, I want to sell it.  And so with him, when he said, I wanted to sell it, that was it.  There was no turning around.  So I refused actually to be a part of that.  And that's what ended our relationship.  Were you, I know you weren't stealing from him.  I don't think you were.  But was there anything that was a little questionable with you?  Because you wanted to keep the company and you wanted, Ed Weinberg wanted to kind of stay with it. 
[02:25:00]  Was there anything that you weren't telling him or kind of doing like, eh, fuck him.  He doesn't need to know that.  No, no, no.  It was his company.  I didn't, you know, I owned a small part of it.  But it was his company.  And he could do with it what he wished.  This was just, in effect, what you'd call a backup offer.  You guys go sell it for whatever you want.  And if you can't for some reason and you're interested in this, here it is.  So that was presented to him as if I was trying to buy it for that amount. 
[02:25:30]  It wasn't my money.  I think it was the Tribune Company was trying to buy it.  Or wanted to buy it.  And it got turned around as things often do in Hollywood.  Showbiz, you know.  And that's what happened.  Have you spoken to Joan Rivers in all these years?  I haven't spoken to her at all.  If you saw her, would you two speak?  I certainly would.  I don't even know if she would remember me, to tell you the truth. 
[02:26:00]  But this, again, the last time.  And we were friends.  I mean, it's not like.  But I haven't seen her, I think, since 1985.  Oh, okay.  I'm wondering if she blamed you at all.  Perhaps.  Well, the book is called Johnny Carson.  It's on set.  What does it come out?  Tomorrow?  I believe it comes out tomorrow, yes.  Well, it was absolutely great.  And I actually made myself stop reading it so I could finish it closer to the interview.  Because I was ripping through it. 
[02:26:30]  So I saved myself about 40 pages to finish yesterday.  And I did.  And I thank you for coming in.  The book was tremendous.  Well, thank you very much.  I appreciate the compliments.  And I enjoyed being here.  Who would.  If Johnny was alive today, who would he like best in late night, you think?  Would he be a Leno, Letterman fan?  And I know he wanted Letterman to get the gig and all that.  Well, we didn't get into that here today.  But I was asked that question before.  And I don't think he'd be watching any late night comedy show. 
[02:27:00]  I think he'd be watching sports.  I think he'd be watching Fox, CNN.  That's what he did.  He never watched his own show.  So I doubt that he'd be watching someone else's show.  I just don't think that would be the case.  Even if they were top of the heap by far.  I think all these guys are terrific.  But I don't think he'd be watching any one of them.  Was he as good a tennis player as he thought he was?  No.  Thank you very much. 
[02:27:30]  Thanks for coming in.  We'll be back in a few minutes.  Good meeting you.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  And now back to...  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  We're back.  The show is now.  Jim Florentine, Sam Roberts, and Jim Norton.  As O.B. and Anthony were crushed by a collapsing motel room ceiling. 
[02:28:00]  It's tragic.  They were both found nude early in the morning.  Both their penises.  Inside of each other?  Yeah.  It was a really, really weird, locked up, lovemaking pose.  I don't want to embarrass them.  If they were having gay sex, would they be wearing condoms?  Would O.B. wear a bag?  Or would Anthony wear a bag?  No.  I think what happened was O.B. was more concerned about disease and condoms.  But Anthony said, I love you, so I'm going to raw dog you.  He said that to O.B.?  And O.B. trusted him?  Yeah.  He said, you know what?  If he loves me, he wouldn't hurt me. 
[02:28:30]  And I think that they went condom-free relatively quickly.  Well, that's a beautiful way to go out.  I think it's nice.  But do you think if O.B. was doing the ass-fucking, he would put a bag on?  He'd probably try to, but Anthony would tear it off with his teeth.  Anthony...  He's known to do that.  Yeah, Anthony likes it raw.  Yeah, Anthony hates that.  And Anthony's always, like, likes...  You guys don't hear it during the break, but he'll say, like, if I'm not going to take  the cum, what's the use?  And he'll laugh and eat his breakfast.  But what if O.B. said, look, I don't want to come too quick because I'm so attracted to  you that I'm going to wear a bag?  Anthony would say that when I feel you swelling...  Because Anthony was very intuitive in his anus. 
[02:29:00]  When I feel you swelling, I'll just pull off, and I won't let you.  That's how they would work it.  All right, so he'll work it that way.  Yeah, yeah, he'll just pull his ass off real quick and not allow the orgasm.  You think Anthony would be disappointed if O.B. came in, like, a minute?  Not at all, because Anthony would always...  Anthony's a good dude, but he would always go as, like, he would always...  His motto was, don't worry if you cum quick, because I'll suck you back to health.  All right, so he...  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How do you know all these specifics?  He was just telling me these things.  It was really weird.  Oh, just because you guys have been buddies for a while. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, it's weird stuff.  I see.  Yeah, it's all right.  So Anthony would later afterwards in bed and go, all right, what did I get out of this?  No, not at all.  He would totally understand.  Absolutely.  Now, would O.B. understand if Anthony came in, like, a minute?  It never happened.  Never happened.  Anthony holds out?  Oh, Anthony can fuck for hours.  Wow, I didn't know.  Yeah, what happened was usually O.B. would get sore, and finally he'd just, like, hit...  He'd reach back and pat Anthony's stomach, and Anthony would know it's time to stop.  Really?  Yeah, it'd be weird.  But what if Anthony was so attracted, he was finally inside of O.B. after all these years 
[02:30:00]  that he came quick?  Would O.B. take it personally?  Would O.B. be mad?  He might take it as a compliment.  To get a beast like Anthony to come quickly, you damn well better be good-looking.  And that little V.  Anthony likes a man with a V.  He does?  Yeah.  By the way, I want to correct a couple of people on Twitter, which is rare to have to  do that.  Yeah, they're usually right on the money.  Oh, 100%.  But the guy goes, he said the quarter million is $2.50, not $1.25, Jimmy.  I know.  He said a quarter million a weekend, so it's $1.25 a show. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, he was doing two shows on one night.  Yeah, or two shows in over two nights.  And a quarter million a night.  And some guy is going, the math doesn't add up in 1980.  Yes, it does.  Even if it was a smaller theater, because he might have been doing two shows a night,  so it might have been $1.25 for the night.  But either way, casinos routinely overpay performers.  And they've been doing it for years.  Like, when you look at a casino, they will always overpay for big performers.  A, for the prestige of having that performer there. 
[02:31:00]  And B, it brings gamblers into the casino.  If you remember the Godfather, see if some of his Hollywood friends will do the same.  So when you hear contracts that are outlandish in a casino, they're believable.  Britney Spears just got like, she's getting like a million dollars a show for the next,  you know, two years to do a show once a month in Vegas.  They'll overpay.  And they want the show over early to get people out gambling.  They never want a long, whether it's a music show or a comedy show.  Because that's the one spot where people are not just buying tickets.  They'll buy tickets because they're going to stay at the hotel. 
[02:31:30]  They're going to gamble in the casino.  That's where all the money gets made.  And they're going to come back.  They're going to have great memories of the hotel.  And the hotel looks bigger and better and, again, more prestigious because it gets the  biggest act in show business, who at the time was Carson or who now it's Britney or whoever  the fuck it is.  You know, so, yeah, they do.  So the math was not off, sir, whoever said that.  Britney did an interview because she's doing, she's got residency, I guess, now in Planet  Hollywood in Vegas.  Oh, that's good.  And somebody asked her if she's going to be doing live singing, not lip syncing.  And she said, yeah, I mean, I always do live singing, so that's what I'll be doing. 
[02:32:00]  And it was just a lie.  Yeah.  She's just lying.  You'll do live singing in the studio when you're making the record because you have to  project into a microphone.  And that's it.  That's it.  And then you'll be, you know, running around to that track.  Yeah.  You know.  With a headset on.  Yeah, with a headset.  With 75 people following behind you doing dance moves.  Right.  You wouldn't want to see her live?  You're not a Britney Spears guy?  She's sexy.  Yeah.  But the music, I don't even know one of her songs. 
[02:32:30]  I didn't yet.  No.  That's out of my world.  That stuff.  By the way, do you know what happened with the, what happened with Banksy's art in Brooklyn?  Do you mean the canvases?  No, the one they were charging.  Oh, that I don't know.  But did you hear what his exhibit was on Saturday?  No.  He set up like a stand.  Like, you know how right out in front of this building, they have guys and they're selling  photographs or fake paintings or whatever. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  A little, he had an old man set up one of those stands and it just said graffiti art and they  were selling original Banksy canvases for like $60 each.  Oh, wow.  But nobody knew they were actual Banksy's.  So people were just walking by, like a couple people bought them.  Where was this?  Central Park West.  So if you bought like 10 of those.  If you bought, one of them could be worth six figures.  Really?  Yeah.  And that was the exhibit for Saturday. 
[02:33:30]  Were they good?  Yeah, they were great.  He's a pretty original thinker.  I'll say that.  Yeah.  Bringing in Tom Arnold is here who I like.  I don't even know what Tom is promoting.  He's got gigs coming up.  Oh, he does.  Okay.  I just like Tom.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Tom.  We're on the air.  See you guys.  We got you.  Welcome.  They're getting me some tea.  Hi.  That's fine.  Some tea for your voice.  Yeah.  Oh, is this on?  It is.  Yeah.  Can I put my Nicorette right here?  Yeah, sure.  Thank you.  How many pieces is that?  That's three, four milligram pieces. 
[02:34:00]  I was on four, four milligrams, but I'm cutting down.  I've been on it for ten years, and I never smoked.  I thought you were fucking serious.  I'm like, oh, you're psychotic.  I smoked a lot of cigars, and then I had to quit one day to do this job.  And I quit that day, and I chew this.  And it's the same thing.  It's the same drug as cigarettes or cigars.  And it's just that I'm addicted to this now.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Rich Voss, our friend, is hooked on the gum.  The gum is hard to get off.  It is really hard.  Yeah, I'm down to 12 milligrams ten times a day. 
[02:34:30]  I never liked it.  I tried it once when I was still smoking, and I was taking a long flight.  And it just fucking tasted like pepper.  It's better now.  I have to say, when was this when you tried it?  Oh, I quit smoking ten years ago, so probably late 90s.  They come out with much better flavors.  Yeah, I'll give you some if you want.  No, no.  But does it feel like you're smoking?  It does.  Whatever is a recovering drug addict, I know it gives you that same drug.  You know, if you're addicted to morphine and you chew gum, morphine gum, it would give you the same drug. 
[02:35:00]  And that's what that does.  Because I noticed the way I did it was I did the patch, and I did it for exactly the right amount of time.  It was one of the few things I actually followed the instructions on.  And I wound up, I was drinking a lot of water, and I realized I'm making the hand-to-mouth motion.  That's what most of it is.  It was that fucking motion.  Yeah.  And also, you have to step out a little bit.  Especially with cigars, but also cigarettes, you can't be around people as much, so you get to have a little private time.  Oh, I need to go do this thing that's just me. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  And so it's an excuse to socially sort of step out or to smoke with people.  I don't know what it is.  It's not just physiological.  Does it give you energy, too?  I think this does.  You know, I try not to drink caffeine now.  I have one tea in the morning.  I used to drink 12 to 20 Diet Cokes.  Now I don't.  It's bad for your sperm count.  20 Diet Cokes?  Yes.  A day you would drink?  Yeah.  I worked a long day.  Is it bad for your sperm?  It is.  Those chemicals that make it... 
[02:36:00]  Aspartame?  Not fattening.  Aspartame.  Yeah, that's horrible.  It's like poison, I'm told.  Well, it's also, yeah, very cancer in rats.  I mean, it's very, there's definite connections to cancer.  It definitely affects the sperm count, though.  I didn't know that.  That almost makes you want to keep drinking it, because I like to dump inside, so the less  sperm I have, the better.  That's true.  Well, then you should definitely do that.  Instead of getting a vasectomy, just drink a lot of time.  Or just being a responsible adult wearing a condom every once in a while.  Yeah.  Well, I think we understand that's not going to happen.  That's the great thing about being married, is you can dump inside, as you say so eloquently. 
[02:36:30]  See, I'm married, and me and my wife, I still wear a bag.  Because you're fertile?  Yeah.  Oh, well, yeah.  We're trying to make more.  We just had, I have a six-month-old, and it took me so long, 23 years, to get a woman  pregnant.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And we want to do it one more time, so we're trying.  All right, well, that's different, though.  If you want to, you know, you're married, and that's what you want.  Right.  It's different than me, just being single and hoping that you're...  Have you never gotten anybody pregnant?  Not to my knowledge.  I had one girl tell me that I had gotten her pregnant, and that she got an abortion, 
[02:37:00]  but I didn't believe her.  I think she was lying for attention, because it was so long after the fact.  Are you sure your sperm is okay?  I've never tested it.  Let's hope not.  I mean, believe me.  I hope they fucking stumble and go the wrong way.  That's the last thing I want.  I never did either, until a couple years ago, either.  Never got a girl pregnant.  Right.  And I slipped up on bags a lot.  Yeah.  Well, it seems like it's harder and harder to get people pregnant, in our environment, or whatever  it is. 
[02:37:30]  And so, you know, a lot of my friends that are younger are going to this nut doctor  that teaches you how to keep your...  In case you do want to have a kid one day, and then you freeze it, and then you have it,  which you might want to do.  Sure.  And then when you're ready to go, they just put it in your wife.  Oh, wow.  So you can get a vasectomy?  Yes.  The only reason I don't have a vasectomy is I like to shoot, like, a good amount, and  I was always afraid a vasectomy would stop that and make my loads smaller.  No, it's the same.  A couple friends have gotten vasectomies.  Loads don't change.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Because there's something about the punishment element that I like. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, the only thing you can't whack your bag for a couple days after a vasectomy,  that could be a problem for you.  That's fine.  Don't you hate it when you're almost ready to cum, and you kind of fuck it up?  Like, you're trying to extend that almost period a little bit, and you fuck it up so  your cum is not that good.  It's sort of in the middle ground, like you're there, and then you go back a little bit,  and you get a little too greedy.  Yes.  Oh, I hate that.  Dude, it's funny you say that, because I edge a lot.  That happens when you're edging.  Yes.  And you're stopping and starting and stopping.  And I came the other night, and when you cum, as it's happening, you feel it. 
[02:38:30]  You know that half of it's going to stay in your balls, and it's going to ache.  Yes, it allows you to almost stop the orgasm.  It's almost like getting an infield single, even though it counts as a single.  A sharp bass hit up the middle.  A squibbler.  It's like you got on, but it's cheap.  Right.  It doesn't feel right.  It looks, in the box score, you blew a load.  Right.  The best cum I ever had, back in the 80s, I did a lot of cocaine, and I'd stay up for  five days at a time.  And then, I could never have sex when I was on cocaine.  But after the five days, I've slept for, you know, 48 hours, wake up, and then you're 
[02:39:00]  super horny, or you get a boner.  And then you jerk off.  That cum, from, you know, the five-day-up thing, that is the best.  So, if you ever want to cum really good, do a lot of cocaine for five days, and then  jerk off.  Or if you just hold out and don't jerk off for a few days.  That's true.  You take a little hiatus.  It's always better.  Yeah.  That's true.  Did you ever have girls in a room where you couldn't get an erection when you were on  coke?  Absolutely.  Well, I mean, I think, I hate to talk about this, but I think my ex-wife, Roseanne, would 
[02:39:30]  probably say, that was a, because I was so, she didn't know I was doing cocaine, and so  I'd be hiding it, even though I was staying up all the time.  Right.  But I would go to work every day on the show.  She thought you were ambitious.  Yeah, yeah.  It's sweating.  But then she would want to have sex, and I could, I knew I couldn't, and this was before  they had boner pills, like they do now.  This is like 1989.  So, I would, it was pretty shameful.  My, you know, I'd hide from her.  I would try to do it. 
[02:40:00]  I would try to do it, and it wouldn't work.  And so.  And she feels guilty like every woman.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's one of the shittiest things that you could do to somebody, and I did that to her.  Or, you know, she would find cocaine, and I'd say, that's not mine, in my wallet.  Right.  If that's the kids, or the housekeeper, I don't know.  But you shame, you're such an asshole.  And then, so she would feel she was crazy.  And, you know.  You never just ate her box, just to hold her over?  Well, I'd do whatever.  If I could get away with that, I would do that, whatever.  And hopefully she'd fall asleep. 
[02:40:30]  But I couldn't get a boner.  And I have a lot of friends that get super boners on cocaine, but it was, it never worked  for me, literally.  Me neither.  And, well, but what, the thing is, a woman starts to feel like it's her fault, and you have  to start making excuses.  She's like, no, I'm just tired.  It's like, so what would you tell her?  Because you couldn't be honest and go, look, it's the coke.  Right.  So what would you say?  I would just say, I don't know what's going on.  I mean, I'm stressed, whatever.  You know, and it got so intense.  And right before I went into rehab, like, that was the lie I couldn't physically keep maintaining. 
[02:41:00]  I mean, that was part of, so, yeah, when I, the night I told her, which was December 10th,  1989, which is crazy to remember, part of it was, this is why I haven't been able to get  an erection or have sex.  And you've been through all this shit this fall.  It's because of me.  I've lied.  And that relief of not having to lie about that also, again, was pretty wonderful.  So, you know, there's so much shame involved, especially with sex.  I'm sure she felt shame that this guy that she loves and loves her wasn't able to do this. 
[02:41:30]  I mean, sometimes I could, and then I would fake.  I could never come.  So I'd have to fake that, you know.  How did you fake it?  Just by pretending, like, oh, that's amazing.  It's, you know.  I'm sure I was sweating so much on her that it seemed like I came up.  Right, that she was just like, oh, this place is off me.  You know, do this thing.  I did it with other women, too, where I'm like, let me work on you first.  Yeah, of course.  You know, and then hopefully she'll come before we have intercourse, and then I won't have 
[02:42:00]  to deal with it.  All the pressure's off, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the best.  And there's so much shame when you can't get a rod for a guy, because, you know, like,  if a woman can't get wet, we just, you lick your fingers, you use your mouth, it's not  a big deal.  Squirt some stuff in there, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But if we can't, there's so much fucking shame around it.  And that thinking about it makes it so you can't, I mean, it's a, wow, it's a tough  one.  Yeah, it is.  I've had it happen sober.  I've had it happen when I was, you know, because I'm sober a while, so it still happens.  And a lot of times it's because you're high, but when you're not high, a lot of times 
[02:42:30]  you're going, I don't want to have sex right now, but men don't know how to  say that.  But we don't know how to go, like, hey, I'm just not in that kind of mood right now.  So our body just shuts down and goes, you're not fucking right now.  Right.  Exactly.  It's hard for us to admit that.  I'm always, because we had a baby, and so I'm like, I'm on call.  Anytime you're ready to go, let me know.  But even then, she's like, okay, let's do it.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Slow down.  Yeah, I'm not ready.  Just let me get a second.  Let me get my thoughts together.  Let me see what I'm going to focus on here.  How have you navigated, because I joke a lot about people in my age group, I'm 45, who are 
[02:43:00]  having trouble with Facebook and all this stuff and porn.  To balance this new technology, this everything available is brutal.  Right.  And I've had a hard time with balancing the pornography and what's real in relationships.  It's been very fucking hard to not just go right to the porn.  Right.  I don't do porn.  I don't need it.  I would in a heartbeat.  If it comes up, I'll watch it.  But I just have these thoughts in my head of things I've seen.  I've been to Mommy and Me class, maybe.  And all the ladies sit around, and you're in a circle, and they're all super smoking hot. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  I hate to talk.  Now I'm in trouble.  But, you know, you get those thoughts in your head, or somebody's at a bus stop, and they're  bending over.  Yeah.  You know, it just sticks with you.  And then you pull that out when you need to.  Or we have pictures on the walls that are artistic, but if you squint a little bit, they're very  sexy.  Well, that's a great thing when you're jerking off to, like, a Van Gogh.  Yes.  Hopefully not a Norman Rockwell.  Hopefully not a kid running away from home.  So I would do that, too, in school, where you start filing things away, and you're like, 
[02:44:00]  I'm going to jerk to her.  Yeah.  They were the best when you could go back and just relive those little bend over.  Or somebody touched you.  Oh, yeah.  Like, we were sitting sort of spread-legged in a circle on Friday, and a lady straight  across from me, I wasn't, I'm not trying to creep on anybody, because I got my baby  there, and I could see up her whatever, and she made eye contact with me, and then she  pulled her shirt all the way down to her knees, which I felt terrible about.  But then in my mind, I kept thinking about that, like, what did I miss? 
[02:44:30]  I should have taken a great look.  You know, those accidental, I was at the Four Seasons, and this woman came out, it was  early morning, and I could tell she'd been up all night, and I made a joke, because  she looked kind of, like, still drunk, and she was like, fuck you, and she got into  the cab, and she put her legs on the ground, and she looked straight at me, and she  spread her legs, so I could see she didn't have any underwear on, and she was, like,  kind of giving me the finger, and I was like, that is fucking hot.  Was she mad at you, or was she being playful?  Well, she was, thought I, she did not appreciate me making jokes, but whatever she did, I 
[02:45:00]  think she was pretty mad, but it was wonderful.  That's hot, man.  That is so hot, because it was, like, accidental, and she had pubic hair, which I fucking love.  You do?  I do.  I go back and forth.  Yeah, I don't want any part of it.  Yeah, none?  Zero?  Yeah, I mean, now that I'm used to not having any, I don't want any down there.  Well, that's, I can't, you know, when I watch porn, and I do at the hotel, like, I'm late  last night, I don't like to see penises, and I do like to see a little bit of pubic hair.  But not the, a lot of the girls are going to the regular bush now.  Oh, they aren't. 
[02:45:30]  Are they, really?  You see it in a porn site, yeah.  Yeah, I've seen a couple.  Not fully, but, I mean, just covering the whole.  Have you ever been with a woman that never has shaved?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, a couple of them.  Once in a while, it can be sexy, but it's very rare that I'll think that's sexy.  I, normally, I find it apish, like, but I, occasionally, it wants, there's just, it has  to be different.  Or hair on those nipples.  It's musty, because all the hair, and it's sweaty.  Here's where you see those women.  You're getting a massage at a regular massage place, and, you know, all of a sudden, you  start thinking, whenever I get a massage anywhere, I start thinking, what if this goes sideways  and good? 
[02:46:00]  Of course, yeah.  If, in the, in the once every ten years that it does go, that's when you see those crazy  bushes, because they're all natural, a lot of them are natural women, and that's when you're  like, holy fuck, you know, you gotta find your way around, man, and, but then, um.  The idea of vegan tantric massage, you know, doing that type of stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm gonna help heal you, and you get a fucking rod when you hear that word.  Oh, no shit.  But I don't like the, uh, hip hair on the nipple.  That's not for me.  Hairy armpits, occasionally, I've had, if a girl doesn't wear deodorant, and it doesn't  smell like a man smell, because that would gross me out.  Right.  There's something about a fucking sweaty woman armpit that's, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get 
[02:46:30]  fucking animal and hot.  I get that.  Feet that smell a little bit, not dirty, but a little stinky.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Because they can never be as stinky as we get.  Never.  Because when we get stinky, we get super stinky.  Yeah.  I like that.  No, I like them fresh.  You do?  I do like them fresh, but.  Yeah, right out of the shower, I'm right, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't like any smells.  I get weird with smells.  Yeah.  But the smell.  But the smell is what fucking gives you a boner.  The animal inside of you.  Yes, yes.  No, not me.  No, not you, yeah.  No, I want, I don't like perfumes either. 
[02:47:00]  I hate when chicks wear a lot of perfume.  I'm not into that, but yeah, just out of the shower, just out of towel, fucking, I'm in.  Do I smell?  That's my main thing.  Yes.  You know, I always like to be out of the shower myself, and then I start thinking, do I smell?  Is this okay?  You know, I'm more insecure about myself.  Yeah, because that's like, if I eat a girl's ass, like, I like it to have like a little bit,  again, I don't want to smell.  When you say eat ass, do you mean the vagina or the actual asshole?  Oh, the asshole.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll do that.  Sure, I love doing that.  Of course. 
[02:47:30]  But I don't need her right out of the shower, but I don't want it dirty, or like, not that extreme,  but just like a little bit like a fucking.  One of you just danced with her for two hours in a club.  That's, I would prefer to.  I don't even dance, but I would want to dance versus to get her sweaty.  What if you get a little toilet paper on there, like a little piece of your head?  That I wouldn't like.  No, that I wouldn't like.  I was with a buddy of mine once.  We were having kind of a threesome where I was watching him.  He had his, Bob Kelly, he had his foot up against the wall, and he was getting his  ass eaten by a girl.  And she said, I'm whacking off on the couch watching, and I heard her go, and she spit out  a piece of toilet paper. 
[02:48:00]  I'll never forget that.  Really?  As long as I live, I'll never forget that.  And she went right back in?  Right back in.  She's a fucking trooper.  Bob was handsome back then.  She's a trooper.  Yeah, she's a good girl.  But, yeah, I like my ass eating, and I like doing it.  But again.  What about you, Tom?  I love it.  Absolutely love it.  Doing it or getting it done?  Both.  Yeah.  But I prefer getting it done.  You know, I like it.  I like to be touched.  Derek.  Yeah.  I like that.  That'd be great.  It doesn't happen a lot once you're married.  Yeah.  Right.  It doesn't.  That's more of a question.  But it should happen once.  You know, because everything should happen once with your wife. 
[02:48:30]  But no, she's not.  And it's hard to ask for.  You can't ask a girl to do it.  Oh, I ask directly.  I mean, appropriately.  Fucking eventually you have that argument where you put it all out there.  God damn it.  Just lick my fucking asshole one time.  Other people have done it.  You don't want to say that.  Right.  But, you know, it just means a lot.  Maybe you don't need it all the time because you'll remember that time.  Yeah.  I did have the argument once with a girlfriend.  It was a girlfriend whose ass I would eat.  And she just didn't go near a man's ass.  That's true.  My last girlfriend, you know.  Right.  We had that discussion in the first month of our relationship. 
[02:49:00]  And eventually she started doing it.  And it was more on principle for her.  Like, she was like, oh, you're mine.  I'm not going to eat a guy's ass.  Like, it was that weird stubbornness.  Women have that.  I'm clean, though.  Like, I make that.  I make sure I'm showered.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  You know.  It's not about disrespecting her and having a dirty ass and saying, I dominate you.  Lick my ass.  Because some guys are like that.  And that's the problem.  Because there's so many asshole guys out there.  Your ass is licked like a human being.  Right.  And be treated like somebody that you care about and love.  Nothing says I love you more than that. 
[02:49:30]  It's just a wonderful, bonding thing.  It really is true.  It's absolutely true.  I love converting a girl that doesn't.  I've never had that done.  I don't want that.  And I go, just let me try.  Right.  And they're like, holy shit.  And then they want it done all the time.  Right.  Hopefully by you.  Well, whoever.  Yeah, yeah.  But converting them.  Yeah, that's great.  I just want to be the first one to get in there and then set them on their way.  Do you keep a record of that?  No.  But, you know, I got it in my head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  We all do.  I'm like a numbers guy in the 30s.  It's all up here.  Yeah, I mean, you probably know.  You probably know how many different girls' asses you beat. 
[02:50:00]  That's true.  Like, that's one you can go back.  All right, well, that way.  All right, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's where you know you get into a point where you're just too perverted, though,  when you start meeting women that you've met online or, like you said, massages.  Massages are very intimate things.  They are.  It's fucking nice.  Yeah.  I've had a, I was in Minneapolis, and this woman, it was probably 72, I would guess.  And she had the full uniform on, like the white pants, the white, whatever, and she  was, the towel was moving around a little bit, and I got a boner, and I was thinking,  would I let, she was not going to, she was like a, I don't know if she was a lesbian, 
[02:50:30]  but she had short man hair, which a lot of women in the Midwest do.  And, uh, gray.  And, but I thought, well, if it did go down, it would be okay with me, 100% okay.  Sure.  And this is like 15 years ago.  So, 72 now, that's like close to my age, so it'd be up here.  But it didn't go down?  It didn't go down.  But I almost came, and I thought, because sometimes when you come accidentally, that  freaks them out.  I've never come accidentally.  How do you do that from a...  Well, just if it's rubbing the right way, and you think they're doing it to you, because  the, the ridge of the, of the sheet is rubbing the head of your dick, you think they're doing 
[02:51:00]  that on purpose, and then you come, and they're like, um, I'm going to excuse myself for a  minute while you get cleaned up, and I'm like, oh shit, I thought you were into that.  But either way, you got to come, so who cares?  Yeah.  I got one recently.  Wow, you're hitting on some really good stuff.  I got one recently, where the girl didn't do happy endings, and I knew she did.  And, and like, my, you lay on your back, and your arms are on the massage table.  So she's standing there, and she moves my one arm, so her  crotch won't be pressed against my arm, and she's massaging me, legit.  Right.  But on the other side, she didn't move my arm, and I could just feel her, like, the front 
[02:51:30]  of her thighs, in pants, against my hand, and it was driving me crazy.  And she has her one palm on my stomach, and she's rubbing down my leg.  Oh, yeah.  But it was hitting the edge of my cock.  Oh, my God.  And I was, it was, it threw a sheet, and I was like, oh, my God, and I fucking, I  started to get hard, and I flexed it a little bit, and she didn't move, and I'm like,  oh, she's going to fucking jerk me.  But then she moved her hand and didn't address it again.  And so, like, I think it legitimately wasn't something she was thinking of.  Yeah.  And it was, but it turned me on so much, the innocence of that happening was fucking hot. 
[02:52:00]  And how much, I hope they know how much power they have.  Oh, God, yeah.  Because we don't get boners intentionally to, you know, to do something.  Sometimes it just happens.  And, you know, I've had them actually take my penis and move it to the side.  Oh, yeah, I like that.  Like, they've seen, yeah, yeah.  Really?  I'll take even that.  Yeah.  I hate when they negotiate when they have it in your hand.  Like, all right, how much?  Yeah.  And they're holding it.  Oh, my God.  Just fucking take my wallet.  Yeah.  I'll take care of you.  Yeah.  Just fucking make it.  I don't even need a massage.  Because once you get jerked off, you don't need a massage.  No, not at all. 
[02:52:30]  I've had guys that are so confident they're going to get jerked off, they do it up front,  and then they sit there and get a fucking hour and a half massage.  Whereas, you know, it's always, unless you hire a person specifically for that.  Sure.  But you can't get a great jerk off and a great massage, I don't find.  I know there's somebody somewhere, but usually they're good at one or the other.  So to find someone that does both is pretty sweet, and you want to hold on to that person.  I've gotten a few really good combinations.  Most times, though, you're right, that does not happen. 
[02:53:00]  But if they move your dick to the side, if they touch your dick and move it,  that is an indicator that they're going to do something.  Maybe let you jerk it.  A lot of times they might not, but if they touch your cock and move it,  there's something really sexy about just them touching it.  I had one girl, oh, my God, in the Midwest years ago,  she was massaging me, and I had like a half a rod,  and she took my dick and she kind of threw it to the side,  like fucking disdainfully, but I knew she was being, like, dirty.  So I told her how turned on I was, and she just kept moving it out of the way angrily. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, my fucking God, was that great.  But then she wouldn't jerk me.  See, I would never get it, because they always thought I was a cop coming in there.  For some reason, I think I looked like a cop.  What, your voice and your look?  Yeah, so they're like, ah, you know, even if it was a shady place,  which I just went in for a regular massage,  they'd always think I was a cop, so nothing ever would go down.  They wouldn't even come close to me.  Yeah.  I love a good handjob.  Yeah.  It's underrated.  Nothing like it.  Good, slow fucking handjob, man.  Oh.  Yeah.  I watched those videos in porn once in a while.  They're not bad.  Like, the girls who give really good handjobs, it's something, I guess because you go so full 
[02:54:00]  circle with fantasy and all that stuff.  Although I envy you from just fantasizing.  Like, I envy the fact that you look and pick up real things.  I think that's healthier.  I don't, it just happens.  I'm not out there looking intentionally, but you'll see an accident or something,  like an accidental sneak peek of something, or, you know, it's not, somebody's not trying  to be sexy, but you find that sexy, which is, I think, how people end up having affairs  with their maids and stuff.  Yes.  Because there's an accidental moment.  They're on the stairs, and all of a sudden, something clicks in our fucking sick heads, 
[02:54:30]  and we're like, oh my God, I could have sex with that thing.  Well, you know, it's funny.  You're friends with, it happened with Arnold, obviously, and, you know.  It's happened with a lot of people that you don't know.  Oh, yeah.  But, I mean, that's just an example of a guy we know who's a movie star and good looking,  and his maid was not beautiful.  No.  But my angle on that was there must have been something, sometimes people are just perceptive,  and they read your personality, and sometimes a woman who is not a model can read who  you are and know what you like, and, like, you know, you're a type of guy that 
[02:55:00]  everybody thinks wants to be dominant, but, like, no, no, no, you want feet in your mouth,  and she reads it.  So a woman that can read me can fucking own me, even if she's not amazingly beautiful.  Right.  I agree with that 100%.  It's nice to be read.  Every guy wants to be owned on some level, I think.  Yeah.  You know, I know what you want.  We like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't want to have to lead somebody.  Right.  You don't want to have to tell somebody, all right, now tell me you're going to fuck somebody  else.  You want them just to say it.  But I will do that if I have to.  You have to.  Like, okay, God damn it. 
[02:55:30]  Here, I'll write it down.  I'll type it up.  Exactly.  And if it's your assistant, you have to type it up for yourself, okay?  Yeah.  We'll just read the script.  Is there anything that you've tried to spring on a girl that she was like, nah, I don't  know, that's a little bit too bizarre?  Well, I've done things with my wife, where I'm like, hey, I heard that so-and-so and  his wife, they did whatever, and she's like, you know.  I mean, my wife's not up for anal or, you know, the ass licking.  Oh, wow.  I think she's done that once.  Like, it was a big, special thing, and I begged, and she's like, fuck this. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, you did, yeah.  Yeah, I did beg.  I mean, it became an issue.  Like, I was actually got tears in my eyes.  Like, God damn it.  I want to be totally intimate with you.  And if we just do this once, it'll always be with me.  So, but, you know, there's, you know, there's something, and there's also when somebody goes  right to that the first time you're with them, you're like, that's great, but how often do  you do that?  Yeah, if they go right into your asshole, there's something to be said about that.  Not even a finger, though?  You can't even work that in the mix?  Oh, I like a little.  No, could you? 
[02:56:30]  Her?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, she's not.  Not even that.  I'm lucky if she licks my balls.  I feel so blessed.  Really?  You know, oh my God, I feel so blessed.  Well, I have relatively small balls, and they don't sweat much, which is nice.  Yes.  So they don't stink.  Mine are tight.  Yeah, tight balls.  Which are, my bag is usually pretty tight.  Yeah.  You could use it like a speed bag.  Well, it's in, my dad's bag is super fucking long, and I think that's going to happen to  me one day, but I think because I'm a nervous person a little bit, my scrotum is pulled  up.  Sometimes, all of a sudden, I'll have a super baggy bag, and I'll kind of pull that 
[02:57:00]  down just to see what the fuck.  There's a lot of skin there, but usually, it's pretty tight, especially when I'm getting  a boner, so there's not much to work.  You don't have to work on that big of an area, so, you know, it's not that there aren't  secrets and creepy little things around this corner.  It's all right there.  Just work at it, and then be done.  I want nothing to do with the balls.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't like a girl touching them.  You have a lot of fucking weird shit about you.  No, just give me just the...  Well, he has a big ball, though.  Give him a gigantic ball.  Yeah, I have a huge bag. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, you did?  It shrunk a little, though.  It's almost like you look at Mark McGuire now, and you're like, yeah, it's not.  That's what my bag looks like now.  Like, there was something going on back then.  We're not sure.  It's a little fishy.  How did he lose all that weight?  Right.  Now, I had to just, you know, maybe a cup of them or whatever, but I don't like a mouth  on them.  Right.  Wow.  Just like the first, like, four inches of my mule.  Yeah.  The tip down, the first four.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Below that, it's like paralyzed.  I don't even feel it.  See, I need a hand jerking.  The bottom of the shaft.  I don't want any part. 
[02:58:00]  I just work the top.  Right.  So many times you've got to tell a girl, because she's doing it on the bottom.  You're like, hold on, and just show them like this.  Right, right, right.  Just work the top.  Oh, of course you do.  We're going to be here forever.  Yeah, yeah.  You like a girl just to jerk the head?  Like, oh, that would turn.  Halfway up.  Halfway and then up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  Very nice.  You know, I've been in the hospital before where I've had surgery, and I'm coming out of  it, and I feel, oh, I feel less than human.  And the first thing I think is, as soon as I can jack off, I know I'm going to be okay.  Sure.  So, you know, the nurses are coming in, they're giving you whatever, and then you start, you 
[02:58:30]  know, looking at the nurses, and you start getting a little tingle, and then you reach  under there, and it's not working.  And maybe the next day it works a little bit, but the first day I can come in the hospital,  it's time to go home, because I'm okay.  Yeah, that is a nice thing.  Have you masturbated in the hospital, in the bed before?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  What do you masturbate?  Oh, because you have the memories, so there's nothing on the TV you could watch.  No, but the nurses come in, and they wear pretty cute outfits these days, especially  at UCLA.  And so, but it's also part of your recovery.  It's not like I'm a pervert.  It's like, I need to see it's all working. 
[02:59:00]  Sure.  I'm trying to get my head working again, and my, you know, my nuts.  Do you whack off every day?  No.  Oh, yeah, I do.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, sometimes I don't come.  Tommy, you go dry.  Oil.  Oil.  What kind of oil?  I go dry.  I could go dry at any time, but I don't like cream.  You know, I like AstroGlide.  I find that's the best.  It doesn't gum up on you.  You don't need a ton of it, and it cleans off easier than KY.  KY seems to stay with you.  See, I don't like AstroGlide, because to me, it always, it doesn't work as well.  I like Eros, E-R-O-S. 
[02:59:30]  It stays, it has great viscosity, to quote a car commercial.  I like that.  But AstroGlide, I've tried, and it just, it smells weird and plasticky.  It works for you.  I mean, it's E-R, what is it?  E-R-O-S.  E-R-O-S.  It's also called Pure, P-J-U-R.  I'll write it down for you.  What fucking, Dice turned me on to it years ago.  He presented me on the road with this jerk-off sleeve.  It was a fucking, it was a goof.  It was a pig that you fucked.  It was a masturbation sleeve and some fucking oil. 
[03:00:00]  And all the guys in the crew got one, and I did use mine.  I did use mine.  And I was like, it's pretty fucking incredible.  And I still use the oil today, 15 years later.  So you carry it with you on the road?  No, because of the planes now.  Because, you know, I don't take any of the oil with me.  But I have like fucking eight of them in my house.  I love them.  You should take oil.  I should.  Because when I, like at the hotel last night, you have to use their lotion.  Oh.  And it's never as good.  Never.  It ruins the cum.  It's never quite as good as it is with the oil that you know and love. 
[03:00:30]  You know, it's a little bit weird.  Sometimes you've got to reboot it.  You know, put a little more in too much.  And it smells weird.  It smells weird.  Yeah.  Sometimes they've got that flimsy lotion too.  Sometimes you could use conditioner if it's real thick.  But, you know, you don't want that in the head of your dick.  I don't care.  It's horrible because there is a soapiness to it.  But hair conditioner sometimes could work too.  It's a pinch.  I can't use any of that stuff, man.  I can't use any of the products other than pure jerk off look.  I can't do it. 
[03:01:00]  Or dry.  Dry.  I can do it dry.  I can go dry.  By the way, Tom is promoting stand-up dates.  We should give Tom a plug.  Oh, I do have some stand-up.  And this is why I like Tom.  I wish every guest would just do this.  Just talk and be themselves.  It's just so much fucking nicer than people who won't talk about it.  So many people come in who have careers.  And you're a very famous guy.  They won't talk about anything.  It's fucking awful.  Well, that's why I like listening to you guys.  Because that's what I want to listen to.  I don't want to hear people say, oh, I'm at Stanford and Sons in November.  Even though I am. 
[03:01:30]  Yes, you are.  But, you know, the excuse is to come in here and jam with you guys on the air about whatever we're going to talk about.  That's fun to me.  Absolutely.  People find out fast.  This is one of my favorite clubs in the country, Stanford.  It is.  I was just there.  I started a lot.  I started in the Midwest.  It's a great place.  So you know Craig Glazer.  Craig, the owner.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've never done The Room.  I hear it's great.  It's called Stanford and Sons.  It's November 14, 15, 16.  It's a Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  There's only one show Thursday and two Fridays and Saturday.  I never do Thursdays either, but I thought I'll give this a shot, see what it's like.  See, I like a good Thursday because I always fly in Thursday to do press Friday morning. 
[03:02:00]  So you don't have to do Thursday morning press if you do a Thursday night show?  No, I can't because I'm here.  So I'm already doing this.  Well, I don't want to.  Yeah.  Anyway, I'm excited to do it.  I also have a movie, Jewtopia, that's out.  You can see it on demand or whatever.  That's also why I'm going around doing interviews.  Jewtopia.  Jewtopia.  Yeah, it's me and Rita Wilson.  And I left my notes back there.  J-E-W or J-U-T?  Jew.  Oh, J-E-W, Jewtopia. 
[03:02:30]  Jewtopia.  And you can check it out.  It's a very funny movie with a lot of great people and you'll really enjoy it.  Okay.  And then where is it?  Jewtopia.  Where can you find it?  On demand.  Okay.  Or Amazon.  Or it was in the theaters and it might still be in a few, but it's an independent movie  and it's based on a Broadway, off-Broadway play and a lot of fun people in it.  You know, a lot of people.  Yeah.  Lovitz is in it.  He's a comedian.  Who?  Lovitz.  John Lovitz.  John Lovitz and Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jamie Lynn Siegler and Cameron Mannheim plays my 
[03:03:00]  wife and it's a bunch of good people and I said Rita Wilson and...  How does she look, Jamie Lynn Siegler now?  She's just fucking sexy, man.  She's amazing.  She is so sexy and she's had a baby too.  Oh, she did?  Yeah.  She's stunning and she's such a good, nice gal.  And you know, she's with Len Dykstra's son, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you wonder, I mean, I hear he's an amazing guy.  I know Lenny from...  Didn't he go to jail recently?  Yes.  Prison.  Yeah.  He's out now though, I think, right?  Yeah.  Or he's... 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a sad...  He was making a lot of money on investments.  I remember years ago, I heard that Dykstra was the guy.  Like, he said he made fucking millions and he was so smart with his money.  He made a hundred million and he lost it all.  Oh!  And then fifty million.  Yeah.  How did he do that?  Like, was it bad investments or...  He just, honestly, and this is no offense to him, he just wasn't smart enough to...  He became the guy, sort of a face of an investment scam.  And you know, it's like he had car washes and he would say to me, these are the Cadillac of 
[03:04:00]  car washes.  And that's what his slogan was.  So I said, well, why aren't they the Rolls Royce of car washes?  And he was like, oh shit, I fucked up.  I should have had the Rolls Royce of car washes.  It doesn't...  You know, he thinks about, like, that stuff and he became an expert on CNBC because he's  an ex-ball player and all of a sudden he's making this money, but he really wasn't.  Right.  And he started scamming and he lost...  He bought way too much shit.  Private planes he had and all this stuff.  And he started losing his mind and he's such a good guy and I love watching him play baseball 
[03:04:30]  and he's a nice guy.  But he just got in way over his head and then now he's in prison.  Well, it's like Curt Schilling, who we've been kind of obsessed with, who lost $50 million  on a video game.  It's amazing to me how anybody can lose that much money investing.  It's like, do these guys not watch them?  Like, I go online, I'll look at my statements.  Right.  Like, I know where my fucking money...  Right.  Not that I have that much of it, but I'm careful.  Right.  I'm terrified of getting ripped off and losing anything, everything in a bad investment.  But also, we don't invest in movies that we're in or we don't own comedy clubs and invest 
[03:05:00]  all the money.  Somebody else takes that risk.  Because we are...  You know, we invest a little bit, but we're entertainers.  He...  Curt should never have fucking put his own money up for that.  Yeah.  You know, he put it up because he thought he'd be a billionaire.  Right.  And I like him, and I like his commentating, but, you know, he also was a bit of an asshole.  You know, I mean, if you ask his teammates, if you ask John Kruk...  Yes.  I mean, everybody gets along now, but I think he learned...  I thought he was really humble through this, and I love the guy, and he's a sweet guy, 
[03:05:30]  but, man, I can see that coming with him.  You know, he was on Conan with me, promoting this game that hadn't even come out yet, and  I could see a little bit of desperation, like, holy fuck.  And then about a week later, it was announced that they'd gone under.  So I feel sorry for these guys, but you don't put all your money, your whole career, 20-year  career, on this thing, you know, because he thought he would be a billionaire, and people  want to be billionaires.  So when you were on Conan with him, what gave you the sense of desperation?  Did he not have enough pre-orders or something? 
[03:06:00]  It was just his desperation on his pitch.  He acted like everything was great, and then I talked to him afterwards about it.  He goes, yeah, oh, man, we're kind of in trouble.  And the fact that he's on Conan talking about it, it just was an odd thing.  It's like, hey, let's throw something together.  I'm not selling any tickets.  I've got to get out there.  It just felt a little odd.  And I know he's taking a bunch of money from the government.  The only thing that made me smile is he's such a fucking Republican, and he's fucking  Republicans.  He's right-wing Republicans.  Oh, government. 
[03:06:30]  Too big a government.  The poor people.  They want their food stamps.  Fuck them.  And yet they get these big tax subsidies, like Curt Schilling, got like $100 million  from Connecticut or wherever.  Rhode Island.  Rhode Island.  Fuck!  That's what they do.  They don't take food stamps, because they're way too good for that.  But God damn it, they take these big chunks.  And so, to me, as a, I don't know if I'm a liberal, but somebody that stood up, and he  was always very Republican, very right-wing in his views, and people mooching off the United 
[03:07:00]  States, and then he ends up being a guy that costs his state all this money.  I don't, I'm not happy that that happened in any way, but there is a certain sense of  justice.  But there's a lot, you'd rather see, there are a lot of players that you would rather  see it not happen to before it not happened to him.  That's true.  John Kroc, who I love.  I'd rather, yeah.  Didn't he have testicular cancer?  He did.  He was playing.  Okay.  I think it was Mitch Williams hit him in the nuts.  He was the first base, and he threw a bad throw, and it saved his life, because he  had to go to the hospital, and they checked out his one nut, and then they found out his 
[03:07:30]  other one had cancer.  Wow.  They wouldn't have noticed it, and it was pretty late, stage four or whatever.  Stage four?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  So, his life was saved, and he's had a great career post-baseball, as you know.  He's a great guy.  What's he doing now?  He's an announcer for ESPN.  Oh, he is.  Okay.  He's great.  He's great.  Yeah.  He was on the Best Dad Sports Show with me, and I loved him, and we argued every day, but he's  an amazing guy.  And you're sober for how long?  Since December 10th, 1989.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, a long long time.  No, no, no. 
[03:08:00]  Let me explain.  I had a relapse in 2008, August.  I wrecked my motorcycle.  This is a bullshit, bullshit excuse, because I know the program, and I had worked the program.  I had a motorcycle wreck, broke my scapula, got pain medication, and I'd never liked opiates  before, and I did not work a good program, ended up addicted, 2010, ended up back in  rehab, and been sober since.  But I had all these surgeries. 
[03:08:30]  I went into a coma.  I had to have, you know, had to have my stomach, what do you call it?  I went septic.  What's that mean?  Oh, septic.  In fact, something blew up, and you got shit inside of you.  Right, right, yeah.  So I was in a coma for three weeks, so I had to have seven surgeries after that, all because  I fucked up and did not work a program on the pain medication when I had my accident.  It's 100% because of that.  Because every day, I hear young guys go, hey, I fucked up on this pain medication, and I'd  hear that, and I thought, well, I was a cocaine and alcohol guy, but the truth is, I'm everything. 
[03:09:00]  Sure.  So now if I go to surgery, I have my wife or I have a guy, if I have to take a pain pill,  they're in charge of it.  I'm never in charge of it.  You know, it scares me, pain pills.  Because there are times when we genuinely need them, like for real, but they've always  scared me because I know myself, and it's so easy, like, left to my own devices to fucking  convince myself, oh, no, dude, you need two instead of one.  Like, I know how it's fucking scary, man.  Right, it is.  It is.  And you do need them sometimes, and a lot of people that are in genuine pain are like, 
[03:09:30]  man, it's so hard to get them now because of you asshole addicts, and that's true,  but they're for a purpose.  And I will say this, when you're in the hospital all cut open, and I had a,  fucking colostomy back for three months because of this.  What was this, 2010?  2010.  Wow.  It was so fucking humbling when I woke up from that thing and had to go through all  this, and I had a, something that had to stay open in my whole abdomen, and a wound back  attached to it, which is something they created for Iraq war shootings, and it sort of heals 
[03:10:00]  you, whatever.  However, all this humbling stuff, and I was in rehab with all this, and 90s, and it was  so humbling, and, but yet, I needed to be on pain medication because I had these surgeries,  and it doesn't work as well if you have fucked up and used it when you're not supposed to  use it.  Right.  So then they've got to bring in fentanyl, because they can't get me out, they can't  do the surgery, so it's a good thing, pain medication, but it's a good thing for what  it's for.  When it's needed for real.  Yeah, but the one thing I'm grateful for, and I don't know why I didn't do it, was that 
[03:10:30]  at a certain point, I knew I was in relapse.  Like, I was kidding myself, or lying to myself, going, yeah, but my back hurts, and this motorcycle  wreck, and whatever, but a certain day, around my 20th birthday, sober birthday, I went,  yeah, this is bullshit.  I'm going to have to tell everybody to go into rehab.  Well, good for you that you did, though.  Well, I waited until I went into a coma six months later, but I did not go, well, fuck,  it's on, I'm going to get cocaine, booze, because I'm sure I would have died.  So you didn't drink any booze or do any coke, just the pills?  No, because I was lying to myself that I was so full of shit that I was still, whatever. 
[03:11:00]  Anyway.  You basically, you jumped off a cliff and got lucky because a fucking breeze blew you back  onto the cliff.  That's right.  Like, you came that close.  Good for you, man.  That's right.  Hey, look, you survived it, and it sucks to blow sobriety.  But it sucks to die a lot more.  More importantly, did you get an erection when you were on the pills?  I got an erection in Betty Ford with a colostomy, with a fucking wound bag.  Honestly, that's the moment I was thinking of when I told that story, but I didn't want  to open that can of worms. 
[03:11:30]  But that's the exact moment.  Wow, that's fucking...  With a colostomy bag.  Yeah.  Which is so disgusting and so horrible and so humbling.  You know.  You fucking rule.  Tom is at Stanford and Sun Comedy.  If you happen to be in Kansas City, it's a very legendary place.  14, 15, 16 of November.  That's a Thursday through Saturday.  And tickets are available at StanfordsComedyClub.com.  One long word.  And Jutopia is the movie you can get.  It's an independent film comedy. 
[03:12:00]  And, you know, Jamie Lynn Siegler's in it.  And Cameron Manheim, and who else?  Yeah.  Rita Wilson.  Lovitz is in it.  Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Et cetera.  All right, because we have to wrap up in a second.  Thank you, guys.  You are great, man.  I'm so happy.  Thank you.  How long are you in the city for?  Just, I came in late last night.  You can tell by my voice.  And I leave after a couple hours.  Oh, okay.  Because I would love to...  I'd love to hang.  You are so fucking funny.  You guys are so talented.  Thank you, man.  And I'm sure you are, too.  Oh, no, he's not.  He's a boy out.  But, I mean, as far as comedians and as far as...  You know, at the Montreal Comedy Festival, I was up there a few years ago, and I was not. 
[03:12:30]  I was having an issue.  Like, I was funky.  I just couldn't get my head around what I had to do.  I had to do a short set or something at this gala.  And you were there, and I watched you.  First of all, you were very nice to me.  And I used to feel a little kind of odd around comics, because I always felt, no, they don't  think I do comedy that much or whatever.  But you were so nice to me.  Then I watched you fucking on stage, and you're just so fucking good.  Oh, thank you.  And I said, how do I get my head around being that good? 
[03:13:00]  And the answer was, I don't.  But since then, three, four years ago, I've worked very hard.  I go on the road a lot.  I go to open mics.  I've really learned to enjoy stand-up comedy and nurture it.  It's how I started 30 years ago.  But you need to get out there and fucking suck and bust your balls.  And because of watching you and seeing what you did, and me eating it that night, I said,  I'm going to change things.  So thank you very much.  No, and Tom gets great.  I've done clubs where Tom was there a couple weeks before, and they always get great reviews.  Yeah, it's fun. 
[03:13:30]  I love it.  In the last couple years, really.  Yeah, Tom's great.  I did a great job.  Well, I wish you were in the city longer, man.  Again, Tom, it's Stanford and Sons November 14, 15, 16.  And, Jim, you have a couple plugs because we'll wrap up.  October 17 through 19, Comedy Works in Montreal, New Hope Cinema, New Hope, Minnesota, October 25, 26,  and Joke Factory Comedy Club, Rochester, New York, November 1st and 2nd.  And my podcast is out today, Comedy, Metal Midget, Metallica's on it.  You can get it on iTunes or jimflorentine.com.  And you can see me this weekend working on, like I said, I'm working on the new material, 
[03:14:00]  so it's cheaper tickets.  Friday, Saturday, it's Stitches in Lancaster.  And then next Friday, Saturday, October 25, 26, I'm in Rochester at the Comedy Club,  and then I'm doing the Beacon Theater with Dice Clay, November the 1st.  It's the night after Halloween.  I wish we would have thought of that when we took that gig.  It's a weird night, but tickets are available for that.  And Tom Arnold, thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  It was so good seeing you.  It was fucking great.  Thank you very much.  And hopefully Opie and Anthony will be back tomorrow, unless that whole thing just keeps going 
[03:14:30]  and we can't get them out of the hotel room.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  The Opie and Anthony Show, Opie and Anthony, on Sirius XM.

[03:18:00]  Didn't a while ago, didn't he have cameras up here?  Wasn't he taping?  Probably.  He's complete. He's fighting the whole world, so I would assume...  That might be in the special.  Yeah, I would assume that's a lot of footage to cover.  Yeah, great show today, though.  Tom Arnold was in here talking about getting his asshole licked.  We had Harry Bushkin, who was Johnny Carson's right-hand man for so long.  That sounds like a porn name. 
[03:18:30]  Harry Bushkin?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  It was funny, too. We were talking a little bit off the air, and he was saying that everywhere he goes,  all the headlines are saying that this book, it's just called Johnny Carson, but this book that he wrote about Carson is basically all the headlines, a bunch of other interviews that he's doing are saying,  well, just Johnny Carson, he's a real nasty guy, huh? What a real prick he was.  And Harry's saying, no, that's not what I was saying at all. He compared him to Walter White, which I thought was interesting, the Breaking Bad character, in the sense that he's very complicated. 
[03:19:00]  He's the one that knocks?  You know, Walter White turned into a horrible human being, and he said Johnny Carson was probably not as bad as Walter White was at his worst, but a complicated dude with many different angles to his personality.  Yeah, he didn't put the hit out on people. People put the hit out on him.  Look, I don't know what you're talking about anymore in there, Eric. You're getting very excited, though.  Johnny Carson had a hit on him.  I know Johnny Carson had a hit on him. I was there for the interview. 
[03:19:30]  Let's just make sure.  Are you all still hyped up? You're very excited in there today.  I'm doing all right.  Did you have a great weekend?  I had a great weekend.  Why is that?  It was New York Comic Con.  I figure. You seemed so excited today.  I had a great time.  What did you do at Comic Con?  I was exhausted coming out of Comic Con. You're all energy.  Yeah, I mean, I was exhausted at the end of the day, too, but I went around.  Just excitement of all the divisions of comic books and toys and candies. 
[03:20:00]  Yes.  You know what kind of treats you have waiting for you when you get home?  I went around. I did some shopping.  A little shopping.  What did you buy for yourself?  Nothing that anybody would care about.  No, that's no huge surprise here, but what is it?  I bought some Kid Robot vinyl figures.  What kind of toys?  Well, vinyl figures.  I know, but I mean, what are they of?  Oh, Simpsons.  Okay, they're Simpsons toys.  Don't try to dress up your hobbies.  I'm not.  I'm just explaining. 
[03:20:30]  No, you say Kid Robot.  A lot of people don't know what Kid Robot is.  No, but you're saying Kid Robot vinyl toys.  Just say, I bought some Simpsons stuff.  Yeah, I bought Simpsons and Doctor Who stuff.  Okay.  You bought Simpsons toys and Doctor Who toys, correct?  Yes.  Okay, and that's what you're excited about.  I was, yes.  You have all these Simpsons toys and Doctor Who toys to go home to now.  Yes.  And they're brand new.  Are they on display already?  Some of them are.  Some of them are not out of the box.  So how much did you buy?  Let's see.  I bought six Simpsons figures and one, two, three, four, five Doctor Who figures. 
[03:21:00]  And then I got a figure that I previously owned.  I had got signed.  Okay, so you got home.  So when you come home with bags of toys, is your wife saying anything?  As long as they're not near her.  She doesn't care?  No.  As long as you're going right downstairs with them.  Right downstairs.  And you put them in the E-Rock Pleasure Chamber?  Yeah.  Is that what you call it?  No.  Oh, you should.  The E-Rock Pleasure Chamber where you keep all your Legos and your toys and everything. 
[03:21:30]  Look, I don't, I'm not hating on you here, Eric.  The whole reason I was at Comic-Con was as the host of the Toy Hunter panel, okay?  I, I, I.  How did that go?  It was great.  That was the place to do it.  They do these panels at Comic-Con where they have people show up, and they're generally people  that the geek community will be into, and they go, and they speak, and you get to sit and  watch them speak, and then they generally do a Q&A.  Well, you remember the Toy Hunter.  He was on, it was just a weird show.  He was on the after show, and I believe it was him, comedian named Brendan Burns, the Australian 
[03:22:00]  guy, if you remember, and Who Kid, and it was just total anarchy and strangeness that  he's sitting here trying to talk about He-Man toys, Brendan Burns is sitting there trying  to talk, make jokes about professional wrestling, and Who Kid is just talking about pussy, and  he don't know where he's at, this Toy Hunter, but he enjoyed himself enough that Travel Channel  wanted me to host the Toy Hunter panel, plus, I think they know I'm a nerd.  You know, they know. 
[03:22:30]  I'm still going.  I'm like Eric.  I didn't buy anything, but I'm going from booth to booth.  I'm checking out all the toys and everything.  You didn't go see Hacksaw Jim Duggan?  No, I heard he was there, though.  He was there.  He was working the crowd.  Of course he was.  He was trying to sell those goddamn wooden boards.  Yeah, he was selling a mini two-by-four.  He really was selling them?  He was selling them where you could buy that with a photo, like a package combo deal, and  he would sign the board for you.  Well, I saw Hulk Hogan was there, charging a whole bunch of money.  He had a huge line, too.  Well, he's the Hulkster, after all. 
[03:23:00]  I've got to tell you.  Oh, I've got to tell you, too.  The Sylvester Stallone line.  The Sylvester Stallone line was very big.  They sold out of autographs.  This is a guy charging...  I don't know.  You didn't see this, Roland.  I think it was like...  Let me get the...  On Sunday, I went back to do more interviews, and Sylvester Stallone was charging like $400.  $495 or $395?  I think like $485.  I went in the $400s.  Somewhere around $400 to get an autograph of Sylvester Stallone.  They sold out of autographs. 
[03:23:30]  And I don't know how you sell out of autographs.  I would think that if you could get people to pay upwards of $400 for your autograph...  You'd just keep it going.  Just keep signing.  But did you see the cheat sheet, though?  It said if you get a boxing glove, it's plus $30.  If you get a Rocky item, it's plus $40.  When you're charging that much...  Sylvester Stallone...  Remember what we were talking about on O&A, Jim?  I do, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, we were talking about how much he was charging for autographs.  Yeah.  He sold out.  Of course he did.  He completely sold out of autographs.  I had no doubt that he was... 
[03:24:00]  Was he in New York?  Yeah, he was in New York Comic Con.  Oh, I thought he was doing L.A.  No, no, no.  San Diego.  I didn't know that.  $445 a ticket for Sylvester Stallone.  I had no doubt that he was.  For what?  The photo or the autograph?  Um, this is for the...  It's $395 for the autograph.  Okay, yeah.  $445 for the autograph and photo op.  And then Roland was just telling us that they did plus additions for certain things.  You had to pay more if you have a boxing glove.  Plus $30.  So, uh...  That's not bad.  Yeah, I mean, once you're paying $400 for an autograph, an extra $30, whatever.  I mean, I understand they have to pay a lot of money to get him in the building because 
[03:24:30]  he's Stallone.  But, you know, I mean, that's also...  That's the company that charges...  That hires Stallone.  Yeah.  It's not like Stallone...  I mean, he knows what he's doing, but the company has to pay whatever Stallone's fee  is for showing up.  Sure, I know that covered a lot of his fees, I'm sure.  And then they have to figure out how much to charge for an autograph and a photo.  How many people did he have?  A lot.  It was...  There's just a level two on the far right side of the Javits Center.  You go down the stairs is where all the autograph sessions were.  It was from the very back corner all the way going up to the stairs where you enter 
[03:25:00]  the place.  Who else was doing autographs?  Sigourney Weaver was on Saturday and she had the same exact line.  It was just huge.  David Duchovny had a massive line.  Yeah, there was a ton of people.  David Duchovny had a big one.  With Gillian Anderson.  From the X-Files.  Hulk Hogan, we said earlier, had a big line.  Oh, they had a really good lineup then.  Yeah, they had a ton of people.  Eric is like...  He's more talkative than I've heard of him in years.  He needs a barber beefcake.  He'll walk up and slap him and come back ten minutes later.  He's super excited today, U-Rock.  U-Rock, why are you so excited?  I think he's got Comic-Con fever, but he has just been... 
[03:25:30]  spouting off the mouth ever since the after show started.  He's just, boom, boom, boom.  I love it.  You're happy, huh?  I'm not insulting you.  It's just jarring.  Andrew Lincoln had a huge line, too.  Of course.  Did you watch the premiere yet?  I did not yet.  How was it?  It was good.  I mean, it's tough to watch a show like that now, week by week, instead of just doing  it all in one.  Blowing through the whole thing.  Yeah.  And they still left it.  They have a lot to still...  They didn't set up this whole season in one episode. 
[03:26:00]  Okay.  You're kind of watching it going, well, what's happening now?  And you didn't really get all the answers, which is frustrating for our Netflix world,  but I guess it's the way television is supposed to be.  Yeah, walking dead fucking...  I've been thinking of that.  Yeah, leave it there, Chip.  People get it.  Don't people pick up on it.  Scrambler in Chicago.  Hey, Sammy.  Did maybe Stallone, did he like, if you paid this absorbent amount of money, did you get  like five minutes with him and he only had like scheduled time?  No, no.  You get an...  Like fist in the air. 
[03:26:30]  How you doing?  Gone.  Like 30 seconds for $425.  You go, you pay $400, and all he's going to do is sign a picture for you and hand it  to you.  And he's standing by a backdrop already, so it's in, out, in, out, in, out.  If you pay another $400, then you can also take a photo with him.  But how in the hell do you actually run out of autographs?  I don't get it.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Thanks, Grandpa.  I'm assuming that they do it by time.  X amount of spots, yeah.  But you would think that if you're in a position to charge $400 for an autograph, just keep signing 
[03:27:00]  until your hand falls off.  That's to me...  Garth Brooks did that 24 hours that he signed, but free for the fans at...  What, is it for a record release?  Garth Brooks did this?  They did it for like FanFest for Nashville.  How did he do it for 24 hours?  Yeah, they said he did not leave until the next day until everybody got an autograph.  Jesus Christ.  And his whole hand was swollen.  He won't even put his shit on Spotify and he's signing all that stuff.  Why won't he?  Garth Brooks, he's never done it.  He's not on iTunes or something.  He won't release any of his music digitally.  I understand that, but I think that's an outdated mode of thinking. 
[03:27:30]  It is.  Because, like, the Beatles took a long time to get onto iTunes and sort of, like, the  Stones and Zeppelin.  And ACDC.  Are they on iTunes now?  I don't know if they are now.  I know they're not on Spotify.  I don't know why you wouldn't put your stuff on.  I mean, Garth Brooks, maybe his audience isn't as much that, their country.  I mean, who knows?  It is outdated, though.  Because it's almost like you have to figure out new ways to monetize content.  Because just charging people for an album, it just doesn't...  It didn't work that well before.  It's not like you were making...  You weren't getting rich off selling CDs. 
[03:28:00]  But, yeah, I mean, the idea of charging people money simply for the content that's on an  album is outdated at this point.  It kind of went out with Napster.  Yeah.  It doesn't really work.  It doesn't work.  Like, you've got to figure out how to either attach advertising to it or figure out some  kind of streaming model or make your money back touring or whatever.  Whatever.  I think our show is good today.  You do?  Yeah.  You're happy with it?  I was, yeah.  Good.  Me, too.  I hope the audience is happy with it.  That's irrelevant. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, okay.  I was about to say.  My joy is all I think of.  It's the good thing about the show and the bad thing.  I was talking about how great Tom Arnold was.  Like, could he have fit in any better with you and Florence?  Amazing.  Amazing.  I mean, that's all we like from a guest like that.  Just to come in and be yourself and talk and hang out.  Oh, I thought you meant to come in and talk about ass-eating the whole time.  But that's almost too lofty a goal.  You're never going to get that all the time.  You're going to get that sometimes.  But a guy who's just open about, like, that's why I love James Cromwell.  He doesn't talk about ass-eating, but he comes in and he's open and he's vocal and 
[03:29:00]  he talks about politics.  Or Donald Sutherland was breaking balls.  Like, you just want a guy who comes in and talks.  And Cromwell, he's ready to get into it.  Absolutely.  And not in a hostile or mean way.  Just like, yeah, let's talk about it.  But, like, we didn't even have time to ask Tom Arnold any questions, really.  We didn't get to any stuff about Roseanne or the TV stuff or true lies.  Nothing.  Because it was just like, this is better.  Yeah.  Let him talk about what he's into sexually.  I wouldn't even ask him about Roseanne. 
[03:29:30]  I like the fact that he's still not getting rods.  But, I mean, that happens to guys sometimes, you know.  You wouldn't have asked him anything about Roseanne?  Eh, I mean, only because they've been...  I might have asked him about the roast, what that was like.  Was it awkward?  But aside from that, I don't really care.  I mean, they broke up a long time ago.  Who gives a shit?  Plus, are you going to get any better information than him saying I was too coked up to have sex with her?  No.  And he just gave it to you?  He just gave it.  There's nothing you're going to get that's more.  And I don't really care about that.  You know, she's just a comic and he's just a fucking comic.  Like, that doesn't matter to me that they got married.  Who cares?  Like, that's his life and good for him. 
[03:30:00]  And I'm not fascinated by that one, just because they're a regular couple to me.  I am.  Because they're not regular at all.  They're two crazy people.  No, but what I mean is, I don't see them as so nuts.  It's just a...  Like, you know, they're no crazier than Ozzie and Sharon.  Or...  But they got a reality show, Ozzie and Sharon.  That's true.  Like, they're a compelling couple.  Yeah, that's a good point.  That's a good point.  I think it's also because you're sort of so skewed.  Because you're nuts, too.  You're like a crazy comedian, as well.  Yeah, maybe it doesn't shock me as much.  You're more interested in the normal, like, you'll ask me about Jess and I. 
[03:30:30]  And just normal, mundane, everyday stuff.  Yeah, that's the fascinating stuff to me.  It's like, wow, she actually picked you up from work?  That's much more interesting.  Because most things, actually, people talk about, like, I'm okay.  You've been there.  It's fun to hear it.  Yeah.  Like, I loved his openness, but I didn't, you know.  But there's very few scenarios that you won't be able to say, me too, too.  Well, that I understand, even if I don't do it.  Right.  There's a lot of things I haven't done, but...  Is there?  I was going to ask him about strap-on.  Oh, God, yeah. 
[03:31:00]  I was going to ask him about strap-on, because he likes his ass play, but I fucking forgot.  You didn't get there.  No, and I knew there was something I was forgetting.  I apologize to the audience for my lack of strap-on question.  Well, you know, it's like, we haven't gotten to do many shows where it's just you and me.  And I feel like, as we do more, you'll kind of grow into yourself and be able to ask strap-on questions more.  I hope so.  You know?  Well, that was fun today.  And I love Jim really asking about Opie and Anthony fucking each other.  Yeah.  Do you think that Opie would come faster if Ann had a bag on? 
[03:31:30]  He's painting the picture.  Yeah, really.  That's where Jim comes in with his professionalism.  Yeah.  He's really painting the picture.  He's really broad strokes.  Yeah, I mean, for those that missed it, Opie and Anthony were not here today because a motel roof collapsed on them while they were having sex with each other.  While they were making love.  I didn't hear.  I didn't hear.  Yeah, it was very sad.  We're going to miss them.  They're dead, you said, right?  They passed away.  Yeah.  I was just found humiliated nude.  Ann was wearing false teeth.  He was wearing false teeth, and they were out.  But he wasn't wearing them. 
[03:32:00]  They were next to them on the pillow because apparently there was something that he needed his mouth for.  And I don't know who was inside of who.  The coroner is still waiting to determine.  Are you telling me that Opie may like his shaft gummed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no way he likes Ann's big fake teeth.  Ann's just popped them out.  That's good of them.  That's good.  And I'm glad after all these years they still have that relationship.  They're not going to be happy with that break.  You don't think so?  No.  No.  I mean, Ann didn't even like the teeth thing.  No.  I hope nobody mentions to them on Twitter.  Or that we implied that they were killed making love in a hotel room. 
[03:32:30]  Well, yeah.  It's one of those things where you just have to tweet to them as if they're still alive.  Like, you know, we miss you.  Hey, guys.  Don't tell them we said that.  Keep it between us.  Right.  Right.  That's our secret.  Right.  All right.  I got to go out of the gym.  I'll see you tomorrow.  All right.  Bye, Sam.  See you tomorrow.  Bye, Rowan.  Bye-bye.  Bye, you rock.  You are so excited today.  I'm here.  I feel bad I felt sleep during your Comic-Con.  During my Comic-Con.  It was mine.  Of course you fell asleep.  I went last year and hosted panels and you fell asleep. 
[03:33:00]  Like, I told you, I did the Toy Hunter panel at Comic-Con.  I was away from us a bit.  And all I do is I set rolling up.  Toy Hunter is a show that's on Travel Channel about a guy.  It's like American Pickers, except the guy just buys toys.  And then I guess he resells them.  But he goes into people's, you know, basements and attics and where they keep all their giant toy collections.  And then he figures out what's there that's good.  And then he buys it off of them.  And he does the same thing that American Pickers does and the Pawn Stars does every time. 
[03:33:30]  You know, this is worth about $600.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, I'll give you $50 for it.  Well, I got to travel out here.  I got to resell it.  They're going to negotiate me down.  And it's like, you still got nothing.  Well, you know, I wasn't using the toy.  And I made enough money to take out my wife for dinner.  So I came out on top, I feel like.  But he did the Toy Hunter panel.  And I told you, everybody lines up.  They go in the room. 
[03:34:00]  They watch the Toy Hunter talk for a while.  And then they ask him questions.  It's a very easy thing to host.  Because you just go, I'm Sam Roberts.  This is the Toy Hunter.  First question.  Next.  Next.  Next.  And that's it.  If they're wearing a costume, which a lot of people do to Comic-Con,  you point out what outfit they're wearing.  Hey, there's Stretch Armstrong.  Hey, Boba Fett.  Question from you.  And you call them.  The character name is if they are that character.  And everybody gets this big laugh out of it.  Very easy thing to do.  There's some weird ones, though.  Costumes?  No, people. 
[03:34:30]  Weird people.  I mean, there's a lot of weird people.  It is.  The guy who had his son call in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some guy like.  Am I on now?  Yeah.  Some guy called his son on speakerphone.  Which, to me, I like the whole family tradition.  People want to talk to the toy hunter so bad that dads are calling their sons, right?  What's the scenario where a dad goes to Comic-Con and leaves his son at home?  I understand if your dad.  Maybe he's a mess.  If your dad's. 
[03:35:00]  Maybe the son's a mess?  Yeah.  What kind of a mess?  Maybe he's obese.  Everybody at that place was obese.  I loved it.  I felt so thin.  You felt thin?  Why?  Because everybody with you was obese?  Everybody there was.  Now, do you realize you said obese?  Roland's the obese.  Obese.  Do you think that's how the word is said?  Well, now that you're mocking me, I guess not.  How else might the word be said?  You son of a bitch.  Orlando Beast. 
[03:35:30]  Obese.  The Obese.  Obese.  That would be a good Comic-Con character.  Uh-oh, here comes the obese.  He's a very fat person.  Maybe he gets tired.  Obese.  Obesity?  Obesity.  Obesity.  Well, Roland.  A little chunky.  I'm not going to tell you how to say the word.  Roland sat in the front row of the panel so he could film me because I just videotape  everything and keep it for myself.  And I just looked down at him as the toy hunter is rambling on about Boba Fett or whoever 
[03:36:00]  he's rambling on about.  Roland is dozing off.  Of course he is.  Because he tuckers himself out.  He was just overexcited.  He had the E-rock disease.  He gets all excited by Comic-Con.  And he goes in.  And I guess he was listening to Friday's After Show very closely.  Because Comic-Con is this huge thing.  So Roland is sleeping in the panel because earlier in the day he's walking through the  Comic-Con floor.  Oh, yeah.  And that's where everybody's crowded.  And, you know, that's where all the obese people are really seen. 
[03:36:30]  That's what I'm saying.  Everybody smells.  You know, you have to push your way through.  I brought Jess there on Sunday and she was not feeling it.  This was not her scene.  But I'd rather have Jess at Comic-Con than at one of DJ Who Kids parties.  I don't need her being exposed to that party world.  Oh, no.  No.  Those are abs.  Yeah, I don't need her being exposed to abdomen.  Abdominal muscles.  I want her thinking that six-packs don't really exist in real life.  That's what I try to convince her of all the time. 
[03:37:00]  So, Roland and me are walking through the Comic-Con floor.  And he just keeps yelling out, trying to get through the crowd.  I'm boofing!  I'm boofing!  Everybody just turn around going, what?  You're taking ecstasy up your ass?  Yes.  He cleared the way, though.  Well, the way he sweats, you'd probably believe him.  That's true.  You did look like you were boofing at the time.  It was fucking high in there.  Larry in South Carolina. 
[03:37:30]  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  Very comfortable in his milieu.  And it's just here on the radio.  Thanks, buddy.  You know, the guy that didn't take his kid to Comic-Con,  maybe the son is just not into it.  You know, the son...  You know, I'd like to say that.  I'd like to say that.  But the guy, he goes to this Toy Hunter panel,  and during the question and answer session,  he's got his son on speakerphone,  so his son can ask the Toy Hunter a question.  And he goes, 
[03:38:00]  Oh, he really wanted to be here.  He has a question for you, but he just couldn't make it.  And I'm like...  That's cruel.  What did you say, Larry?  That's cruel.  Yeah, what possible scenario could a father have  that he's not bringing his son to Comic-Con?  What if the kid was bad,  and his punishment, he stayed home,  and then he called his son on the phone  to talk to the Toy Hunter to taunt him?  If the kid is bad,  and you go to Comic-Con anyway,  you're a bad parent. 
[03:38:30]  There's very few scenarios  that you go to Comic-Con,  and you leave your kid home,  and your kid's a nerd,  that you're not a bad parent.  Eric is an expert of judging parents.  That's true.  Bad parent or good parent, Eric?  No, that's a bad parent.  He thought parents that bring their kids  to see One Direction were bad parents.  Larry, you've got to think this guy's...  He's got to be a bad parent, right?  Well, I don't know the full circumstance.  I'm not ready to say that he's a bad parent,  and having been a parent myself...  Right.  There's no standard way to punish children, 
[03:39:00]  because some things that are terrible  to punish one child  don't faze another child.  You have to...  Each child's punishment  has to be individual,  because if you're going to punish them,  number one,  you punish them for a reason,  and number two,  they have to understand the reason  that they're being punished,  and why they're being punished,  and you have to consistently  carry the punishment through  without regard to the emotional...  True, but look,  this wasn't a punishment,  because the dad was calling his son  and letting him be a part of it, 
[03:39:30]  and another reason  is that if it was a punishment,  another reason that makes this guy  probably a bad parent,  is if this was a punishment,  then you don't go to Comic-Con  on your own  and just enjoy it by yourself.  Like, if you're a father  who has a kid  who enjoys Comic-Con,  you should not be able  to enjoy Comic-Con  without the kid.  Right.  Well, no,  that's the point of the punishment.  If the child is being punished  for something  and not allowed to go to it,  you don't stop your enjoyment, 
[03:40:00]  but by the same token,  you don't rub it in  by making the phone call.  And maybe the child  was unable physically to attend.  Maybe the child was ill  and he just didn't say that.  Bro, I'm walking around that place.  I see obese individuals.  I see people in wheelchairs.  Golf carts.  There are people in golf carts.  There are nerds  sneezing and coughing  everywhere I go.  Yeah, people are missing Comic-Con.  And I'm telling you again,  if your kid is sick,  you stay home with your kid. 
[03:40:30]  You don't go to Comic-Con  without him.  Well, it depends.  I mean, if the mother's  all taking care of the child...  So what?  So you can come home...  So you can come home...  So you can come home  with bags full of comics,  comic books and action figures  and be like,  oh, it was such a blast.  You should have been there.  And the kid was like,  thanks, Dad.  I was at home.  Maybe we all could have  just hung out  and watched Kung Fu  or something.  Sam, if you bring  the saint's home  to the child  and say,  I'm terribly sorry,  but look at this  neat stuff I got you.  Get him on eBay. 
[03:41:00]  That's the guy's question.  Because I don't know...  I mean, I don't know  the circumstance.  I'm not ready to just  blanket condemn somebody  when I truly don't know  the circumstance.  You're a glass-half-full guy, Larry.  Well, what can I say, Sam?  Maybe I'm too forgiving.  Maybe I'm too nice a guy.  I don't know.  Nope.  You're a man of God  and you're going  to a better place than me, Larry.  Well, no, no.  Well, I wouldn't say  that I'm a man of God, Sam.  I just have knowledge of it  because my wife  is a woman of God.  I see.  Believe me,  I know the party line. 
[03:41:30]  That doesn't mean  that I don't believe it.  I'm not trying to say  that I don't believe it  because I believe  what I say.  Right.  I believe you, Larry.  There's a God in heaven.  I mean, I know that, Sam.  It's not faith.  It's not conjecture.  I know beyond a shadow  of a doubt that he exists  and I know that he's in heaven.  I mean, I know these things.  Hell to the yeah, buddy.  Well, look, I got to go.  I got to let other people through.  Okay, Sammy.  You the man.  All right.  I'll talk to you later, buddy.  Tomorrow.  All right.  Bye.  Larry's a good guy. 
[03:42:00]  But when you start  getting him on the God thing,  he really goes on and on.  All I'm saying is,  in my mind,  I don't see any...  If your kid is cool  and he's like,  oh, my dad's a dork.  He likes to go to Comic-Con.  Then you go to Comic-Con  on your own.  But once you're old enough to,  like, once you have a kid,  you're supposed to be able  to enjoy those things  with the kid.  Right?  Right?  I think so.  Like, if I were a dad,  I'd be... 
[03:42:30]  I would feel very...  First of all,  that would be hard to happen  because it would mean  a woman would have to  have had sex with me.  However,  if I was able to pull that off  and I was able  to conceive a child  and that child was like,  Dad, I love going to Comic-Con.  And I was like,  son,  you're going to sit this one out.  I only had enough money  for one ticket,  just going to be old Pop  heading out there.  It's like,  that's a dick thing to do.  Would you do the same  for one of those  wrestling signings?  No.  If my kid liked wrestling,  I wouldn't go to wrestling shit 
[03:43:00]  without him.  Because  the whole point  to Comic-Con  and the wrestling conventions  and Eric,  your toy hobby  and everything that we do  and my toy hobby,  all this little dumb stuff  that we do.  The whole point to it  is to relive childhood  and to not...  and to...  and to kind of  go back to it.  You know what I mean?  Go back to a simpler time  and enjoy the things  that we enjoyed  when we were a kid.  It's a fear of growing up  and it's...  and it's just enjoying 
[03:43:30]  something simple like that.  So once you have a kid,  you're supposed to be  at a level  where you can grow up  and then relive  your childhood  through your child,  not without him.  Yeah.  Is it weird people?  Hey there.  Johnny in Canada.  Yeah.  Well,  my name's Kelly.  I guess it's not coming through.  But I'm gonna  paint a picture for you there,  sweetheart Tammy.  Um.  What?  I don't know any of the words  he just said.  I'm just gonna cut my losses.  Did you hear any of the... 
[03:44:00]  I heard sweetheart Sammy.  No.  Don't do speakerphone.  I know you're driving,  but...  Pull over.  Yeah.  Brian in Wisconsin.  By the way,  our phone screener,  very smart on this one.  He wasn't sure  if it was Brian B-R-Y-A-N  or Brian B-R-I-A-N.  So he did both.  He put the Y and the I  in there.  Yeah,  yeah,  I just spell it  A-S-S-H-A-T.  So that works either way.  Right,  right,  right.  Hey,  you know,  hey,  what if,  what if,  like, 
[03:44:30]  it wasn't the dad's weekend  and the cunty ex-wife  is like,  no,  you can't go  take the kid to Comic-Con  because it's like  not your weekend.  Then the other parent  is the bad parent then.  Then...  he was doing the best he could  because,  you know,  the ex-wife is like,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  I spent $20,000  to make sure you only get  one weekend a month  and it ain't gonna be  this weekend.  That's the...  And then the wife  didn't take the kid  to Comic-Con?  No,  no,  because she's kind of  bitch who wouldn't  let her ex-husband  take the kid  to Comic-Con.  Because she's cunty.  Then I take the bad parent 
[03:45:00]  title and take it away  from the dad  and put it on the wife.  Gotta be.  Gotta be.  Gotta be.  Thanks,  Brian.  What if the kid's got  like a soccer tournament  this weekend  or something?  He couldn't miss like that.  I mean,  I know it's all the  random possibilities  for you guys to play sports,  but what about him?  He wants to go to Comic-Con,  okay?  I don't think anybody  is choosing between  a soccer tournament  and Comic-Con.  By the time you're of the age  where your dad can call you,  can you get...  He's sitting at home  watching the Toy Hunter  and he wants to go to Comic-Con. 
[03:45:30]  The odds of him being involved  in intramural sports  at that age  are slim to none.  Fair enough.  All right,  thank you.  Tony,  in Cleveland.  Hey,  how's it going today?  Sammy.  Good,  buddy.  Hey,  you know,  you're ruling out one thing.  Maybe this kid was like  in a plastic bubble  and he couldn't go.  Double boy.  Dude,  half the people  at Comic-Con  are bubble boys.  You can,  number one,  you can pull it off  like it's just some  comic book character. 
[03:46:00]  And number two,  everybody there  has some kind of  allergy problem.  They've all got weird  medical ailments.  Remember the wheelchair  person in the elevator?  Yeah,  dude,  there was some...  That freaked me out.  And you don't want to say it  because you feel bad  for people  and you want to be  a good human being.  But...  Like in my opinion,  this dad who had his son  on the phone  was not.  But Roland and me  are waiting for an elevator  and the elevator opens up  and there's this guy  in a wheelchair  and he,  it was like  kind of palsy 
[03:46:30]  type wheelchair  where he didn't really  have mobility  and his hands  kind of  were limp  and his head  was cocked to the side  and his chin  was all folded up.  You know,  like palsy looking.  But,  and by the way,  anybody who has palsy,  my heart goes out to you.  That's not what this is about.  However,  he put makeup on  to look like the crow  and it was like  the scariest shit  I've ever seen in my life.  Like,  we take the stairs.  It was like,  all right, Roland,  we're not going to take the elevator.  He turned around  and looked like,  ah!  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  Let me go to  Corey in Australia.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  Why do I have to call  once a week  to tell you  to put a show  on Audible?  Call Audible.  David in,  I mean,  call Audible.  David in Tennessee.  Yeah,  other than sports,  if you have the same interest  as your kid,  you just need to  kill yourself anyway.  No,  you can share interest  with your child.  I mean,  isn't that a good thing?  Not comic books.  Why is comic books 
[03:47:30]  different from sports?  It's still,  you're not performing  the sport.  Sure you are.  I mean,  if your kid's into  football and baseball,  it's universal.  Once you start having kids,  maybe you should kind of,  you know,  forget about comic books  and things,  don't you think?  No,  if you,  here's what I think.  And that's what I was  talking about before.  Because the comic books  and stuff like that,  yes,  it is just an escapism  to go back to  whatever your interest was  when you were a kid.  But I think you could  enjoy the hobby  with your kid.  Meaning, 
[03:48:00]  you don't go out  and necessarily buy  a ton of comic books  for yourself,  but you buy a comic book  for your kid.  And you enjoy,  oh,  this is cool,  huh?  Yeah,  that's cool,  dad,  blah,  blah,  blah.  And you do that.  But you don't,  go ahead.  You may have just turned me,  Sam.  Yeah.  Honestly.  Right.  You share that interest  with your kid  and you can kind of  relive your hobby  that way,  but you don't,  you know,  you don't go to  Comic Con by yourself  because your kid  can't make it.  Like once,  that's what I'm saying.  Once your kid  can't make it to  Comic Con  for whatever reason, 
[03:48:30]  you don't go by yourself.  You just don't.  Yeah.  So you kill the Yankees  and you get the Yankees  by yourself.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  David.  That's exactly  what I was going to say.  In terms of sports,  you go to titty bars  by yourself.  Exactly.  Like David,  if you have,  if you have tickets  to see the Yankees  play or whatever,  whoever,  the Tennessee Titans,  you have tickets  to a game,  your kid can't make it,  but he's a diehard  sports fan,  don't go to the game  alone.  Just be like,  okay,  well,  you know,  my kid can't make it 
[03:49:00]  because all that's doing  is rubbing it in.  Like,  look,  you make your own  decisions,  kid,  but I've got these  thingets.  I'm having a good time.  You turned me,  Sam.  Good.  I didn't think it was  possible,  but you did,  buddy.  Do a good job,  pal.  Thank you,  David.  I keep turning people  all the time.  Rich and Yonkers.  Why,  yo!  What up,  Sammy Dog?  What's up,  buddy?  Yeah.  I appreciate the  attempt for good  controversial radio,  but there's several  scenarios where easily 
[03:49:30]  the father shouldn't be  blamed for trying to  call his son and get  him on with a toy  hunter.  There's your first  day,  and,  and you're trying to  be controversial.  It's controversial and  it's kind of hacky and  I'm sorry,  Sam.  I hate to say this,  but whether a dad  brought his kid to  Comic-Con or not,  like at the end of the  day,  I don't think this  is going to be  classified as  controversial radio.  We just had Tom  Arnold talking about  eating assholes.  your position is,  I mean,  it's easily questioned 
[03:50:00]  whether the father  couldn't bring the son  that particular day or  not,  and the only scenario  you're picking where  he is a douchebag is  if it's one or the  other and he picked  himself.  So,  I mean,  that's,  that's,  Well,  what's the scenario  other than the,  no,  because other than the  divorce thing,  where the mom's got  custody,  there is no  logical scenario  that that's okay.  If,  that's what I'm saying,  if the kid is sick,  if he's too sick  to go to Comic-Con,  you stay home with  the kid.  You don't go to  Comic-Con anyway.  Or the opportunity 
[03:50:30]  to buy your kid  a bunch of shit  because you already  bought the ticket.  Buy it,  look,  I hate to,  I hate to burst  everybody's bubble.  It's,  it's,  it's,  it's 2013,  you buy it on eBay.  Most of it's already  was for sale on the  internet before that  anyway,  and I mean,  you know,  the kid,  the kid's dream  is probably not to  speak to the,  the guy was walking  up to the Toy Hunter  panel with two giant  grocery bags full of  treats.  He looked like Eric  Nagel,  for God's sake. 
[03:51:00]  That's it for Rich.  Rick in Indiana.  Come on,  how's Eric?  Hey,  Sammy,  how you doing?  Good.  Hey,  you know,  once you have  children,  if you have a  common interest,  be it sports,  comic books,  whatever,  with that child,  and you do  a major event  without that child,  you're just an ass.  That's what I'm saying.  That's exactly,  you see what I'm saying,  Rick?  Exactly.  Why do it if you  can't enjoy it  with your child?  I mean,  you gotta put yourself  second once you  start having children  and start,  you know, 
[03:51:30]  like you said,  enjoy it with them,  through them,  through their eyes.  If you do that,  you know,  you're putting yourself  first and that's just  stupid.  Yeah,  and the whole idea  of liking a childish thing,  I don't mind adults  liking a childish thing,  that's all I do,  but once you have a kid,  if you like the childish  thing apart from the kid,  it's weird,  and it's assholy.  It's selfish as hell  is what it is.  It's just,  you know,  it's ridiculous.  It is.  Thanks,  Rick. 
[03:52:00]  And I don't mean to be  too controversial,  but Jake,  E-Rock,  are you watching that  dumb button in case I get  extra controversial  with this topic?  I'm writing both  dumb buttons right there.  I had no idea  that this was such  a hot topic,  this guy.  I thought this was  a throwaway,  the guy just called  his son.  Well,  I'm telling you,  I was sitting there  looking at him like,  what a fucking asshole.  He is a bad parent,  unless he married  a bad woman.  Jake in Staten Island.  Sammy,  I think you're  100% right.  I had a similar  situation like that 
[03:52:30]  when I was younger.  My mom was dating  this guy,  and he had made me  a big hockey fan  because I grew up  around him,  and he introduced  me to the sport,  and he was supposed  to come by,  and we were supposed  to all go out  as a family,  because he used  to live in Jersey,  but he couldn't  come by because  it was snowing.  So he figured  instead of going,  instead of coming by  that he would go  to a hockey game,  and then he would  proceed to tell me  about it afterwards  and tell me how much  fun it was and how  they were signing  autographs because  there was no one 
[03:53:00]  else there because  there was a lot  of snow on the ground.  Yeah.  And you're like,  I'm a kid.  I'm not going to be  able to live  vicariously through  you.  I don't understand  that yet.  You having a good  time means I didn't  have a good time,  and that makes me  sad.  Yeah, he always  had a habit of  doing that.  I mean, like,  wow, like,  that would have  been so cool  if you were there.  It's like,  thanks for telling  me after the fact.  it's crazy.  Thank you, Jake.  Jim in Newark.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  Hi.  Pirate Trucker. 
[03:53:30]  Hey, Sam, the kid  is in the hospital  in a full body cast,  and his dad is there  buying himself  trying to cheer him  up.  You think it's a  full body cast scenario?  Full body cast in  the hospital.  Prop that kid up.  Prop that kid up.  Put him on one of  those, what are they  called?  The push cart  things.  Put him on a gurney  that's held up,  and he can be the  mummy.  Everybody loves, like,  Boris Karloff and  all those guys.  I think there was,  like, two people  in the gurneys. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  You know how  insurances these days,  they're not letting  him go out until  he's out of the  body cast.  So his dad's  gotta be there.  Because he's in  a body cast.  Because he's in  a body cast.  Trying to get  shit to cheer him  up.  Maybe you're  right.  Paul in Chicago.  Hey, Femi, I'm  gonna say it for  what it is.  I'm a father of  an 11-year-old.  I would say,  fuck taking my  son.  I'm reliving my  childhood.  My son's 11.  He hasn't had a  childhood yet.  When it's time for 
[03:54:30]  him to relive his,  he can go on his  own.  Yeah, but you  know why your kid  is gonna have to  relive his  childhood?  Because you're  snatching it away  from him, you  son of a bitch.  I'm not taking  anything from him.  I'm reliving my  childhood.  Fuck him.  I'm sorry to  say.  Down the road, he  could relive his.  Seriously.  I mean, this was  more, I think this  was more for the  father than it was  for the son.  So, you know, I  think the kid, pick  yourself up by the  bootstraps, get over  it.  It's your kid,  though.  You're not, it's  Comic-Con, and he's  a kid. 
[03:55:00]  You're exactly right,  but he will forgive  me.  Regardless of the  fact he's my son,  he will forgive me.  Yeah, but do you  know why, like, do you  know why he's going  to have to go  forward and have  this weird thing  where he's got to  relive his childhood?  Because his dad  would do things  like this to him.  And it doesn't  pass it on.  He will just pass  it on to his kid.  It's a bad cycle.  It doesn't pay off  in the end, because  when that decision  comes, whether to  save your life or  not in the hospital,  he's going to go,  this is for Comic-Con,  motherfucker.  Yeah, he's going  to be like, oh,  oh, sorry, dad. 
[03:55:30]  You need me to make  sure that you stay  on life support?  I was out buying a  Lion-O action figure.  Then I'll see you  in hell.  All right.  See you later, Paul.  You selfish bastard.  Do you who we  should call the  authority?  No.  Joe Piscopo.  Why would we  call Joe Piscopo?  He's got tons  of kids.  He's got more  kids than anyone  we know, right?  He's got more  kids through every  scenario.  Tom.  Yes.  What's up, buddy?  Pathetic. 
[03:56:00]  There's one word  to describe it.  If you go to do  something like that  with your kid,  you know what I  mean?  Yeah.  The whole experience  is ruined no  matter what the  scenario is,  no matter why he  can't be there.  It's pathetic.  You're pathetic.  You're a loser.  And you should be  there for your  fucking kid.  It would deplete  the memory for me  if I knew my kid  couldn't go with me  to do something  like that.  And that's what  it's supposed to  do, I think.  It'd be like,  I was obviously  obsessed with  wrestling when I  was a kid,  as I still am now.  So, let's say,  you know,  they were at the  garden, right?  WWF is at the  garden, there's this  big show, I can't 
[03:56:30]  go.  My dad goes, he  takes a whole bunch  of pictures, and he  comes home and says,  look, I took these  pictures for you.  I'd be like, well,  fuck you.  Like, I wanted to go,  not look at photos of  it.  Yeah, that's just an  adult who is self-centered  and the kid doesn't come  first, and that's a  loser in my book.  Yeah, you'd think that  the enjoyment comes out  of seeing your kid  have a blast.  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, and if you  aren't sharing the  memory, you know, it's  not worth it to me.  Yeah, thanks, buddy. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, and that's the  other thing.  Like, the whole thing  of having a hobby that's  like fun for you is  always better when it's  fun for somebody else.  If you have a little  guy with you that's  like, yeah, this is  cool, then you feel  cool.  I had Roland, the son I  never had.  Yeah, a boofy,  pops, boofy.  Yeah, Roland was my boy  when I was at Comic-Con,  and I said, Roland, what  do you want to see  first?  And he said, boofing!  I said, okay.  He's retarded.  However...  Oh, Eric, did you see  the wrestling?  Did you see the 
[03:57:30]  wrestling?  The wrestling, the  cage match.  Oh, he sees me at the  Mattel booth.  I also wanted to say  that, you know,  Curtis Armstrong,  that's his name, right?  Yeah.  He played Booger in  Revenge of the Nerds?  Yeah, him and the  other nerd guy were  together.  Yeah, he walked by us  at one point, and I  wanted to subtly elbow  Roland and say, Roland,  that's Booger.  But he walks by us,  and I turn my head to  talk to Roland, and  before I can subtly  elbow him, Roland's  going, Booger! 
[03:58:00]  He didn't call him  boofing.  At the top of his  lungs.  Do you think he likes  to have Booger yelled  at him?  He looked miserable.  He's like, ugh.  Well, that's what he's  there for.  He's getting paid to  sign.  I know, but...  No, he's not getting  paid to have Roland  yell Booger at him  on his way to a  press event.  They're ushering him  quickly, and I'm like,  oh, there he is,  a booger!  Tim in Pennsylvania.  Yeah, Sam, what if  there wasn't a kid?  What if this guy just  kind of felt ashamed  for being an older man 
[03:58:30]  at a comic book  convention, and he  just wanted to get  close to this guy?  He already had his  two grocery bags  full of stuff.  Yeah.  And so obviously he  was enjoying himself,  and he just wanted to  get close to this  toy finder dude.  Yeah.  And so he made a  false call, and  other than that, I  just wanted to say,  slow!  That's a great call.  I think that's exactly,  that's a huge possibility.  That's a lot more of a  possibility than that  kid being in a full  body cast.  Because he sounded  very healthy and  happy.  The kid?  Yeah, remember on the  phone, hey, 
[03:59:00]  Tony Hunter, how was  it all?  James in Pennsylvania.  Sometimes kids just  don't understand what's  going to happen, like  at a toy.  Yeah, but you know  what, you know  what, James, at the  same token, take it  for me.  Parents just don't  understand.  Well, I understand  because I go to these  toy shows and I go to  like baseball games, and  what the whole point is  is if my daughter didn't  want to go with me and  didn't understand what  was going to happen, if  Mickey Mantle happened  to be there and I got  her autograph and brought  it home to her and  said, hey, I know you 
[03:59:30]  don't want to go or  you're afraid to go, but  I got you this.  Bro, this kid wanted to  meet the toy hunter.  Yeah.  He loves the toy hunter.  The toy hunter is not  Mickey Mantle.  It's very specific.  Either you have no clue  who he is, or you're a  fan.  I understand.  Sam, you're the best.  No, James, you are.  Mike in Rockland.  Sam.  Yes.  Roberts.  Fuck out.  You're the king of all  media.  Thank you very much, Mike.  I think you're right.  And if you want proof,  some of my interviews  from Comic-Con will go 
[04:00:00]  up on YouTube later  today.  I interviewed Pete  Holmes.  You remember he was on  ONA last week.  Interviewed Method Man,  Bobby Moynihan from  SNL, Dan Harmon from  Community.  All those YouTube videos  will go up later today.  Did you turn down  Archer?  Yes.  I don't need to.  Go on, Mike.  All right, so I'm a  teacher.  I got two kids.  And I think both sides  of the argument need to  drop dead.  The reason we're  dealing with is we're  fucking these kids up by 
[04:00:30]  giving them everything  they want.  The reason we had a  shitty childhood was  because our parents  raised us correctly.  It's not about the  children.  It's about teaching  them what they need,  not what they want.  Like, if I was growing  up now, like, when I  was a kid, I never  went to Comic-Con  because my parents  didn't want to take  me to Comic-Con  because my dad  thought it was stupid.  But that's one thing.  And if your kid is  disappointed because  he didn't get to go  to Comic-Con, okay,  that's fine.  You decided not to  take him to Comic-Con.  However, if you as  a parent are like,  but I'll go alone.  I think it'll be fun.  That's where it gets  shitty. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, that's a  shitty point, but if  your dad did take you  to Comic-Con when  you wanted to go,  you wouldn't be  collecting toys and  worrying about this  when you're an adult  because you're like,  oh, I did that when  I was a kid.  I don't need it anymore.  Right, I'm finished.  It's more fun now.  I'm actually, I'm on  E-Rock's side.  I'm an adult fan of  Lego.  So, I know all about  this and I think it's  good that we got  shafted when we were  kids.  Look, I can't say  that you're wrong,  okay?  I was sitting there  looking at the WWE  toys in the Mattel  booth for like half an  hour, so it is what 
[04:01:30]  it is.  Kevin in Houston.  They did look good.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  I've got a question  for you.  Yes.  If and when you have  a child and let's say  you have a little boy.  We will, Jess and I  will have to consummate  the marriage before  that happens.  That's good.  Yes.  But if you have a little  boy and he fucking  hates wrestling, how's  that going to make you  feel?  Are you still going to  go to like your WWE  stuff?  All that kind of stuff?  I don't know.  I may put the kid up  for adoption at that  point.  I will raise a pro 
[04:02:00]  wrestling fan, okay?  He'll have all the shit  because I'll buy all the  stuff that I would have  wanted when I was a kid  and just give it to him.  It'll be one of those  things where before you're  even old enough to figure  out what you like,  there'll be so much  wrestling shit around  this kid that he'll be  like, oh yeah, this is  cool.  Plus, I'll be like a  super awesome cool dad  and that'll be what I'm  into and he's like, I  want to be just like  that dude, Sam Roberts.  He likes wrestling.  I like wrestling. 
[04:02:30]  You know, go ahead.  How does that suck?  You have a cat you don't  like and then you'll have  a kid you don't like.  I love my cat.  I don't know why you  would say that.  He's the star of my  Starbucks Drake Hands  video in case you haven't  seen that one.  Did you see it?  I did.  He looks adorable in it.  He's a giant.  Yes, he's a big cat.  He's not as well behaved  as some cats, but that's  my road dog.  He's an ass.  He's not an ass.  You're an ass.  You're allergic.  He headbutts.  He does headbutt.  It's a sign of affection.  Listen, you know what I 
[04:03:00]  have affection for?  Boofy?  No, I don't like  boofing.  That's not funny, Eric.  That's where you use it,  Roland, not yelling it  at Comic-Con.  I'm boofing!  No, not boofing.  I'm talking about  Netflix, Orange is the  New Black, House of Cards,  Arrested Development,  now...  I saw Katy Perry this  weekend.  You got...  Huh?  On Netflix?  Yeah, Netflix.  It's a great service.  Yeah, I loved it.  Well, now you've seen  the Katy Perry movie,  you gotta get ready for  the next big thing  from Netflix.  Prepare yourself for

What are you all doing  sitting at home  watching Katy Perry movies? 
[04:04:30]  She's talking about  Jesus and  fireworks.  Yes.  I have to tell you.  And how it's a part  of her.  I might talk about  this on tomorrow's  show because we  don't have that  much time left.  And it makes me  question my  heterosexuality.  I think I'm kind of  over Katy Perry.  You know,  aside from the  titties,  I don't know if she  has that much  to offer anyone.  She just keeps  doing the same,  like,  oh, look at me,  I'm quirky.  I'm like the girl  from New Girl,  except with big  titties. 
[04:05:00]  You know?  That's a good point.  I've won you  over, huh?  That's pretty much  what Zooey Deschanel  said, too.  What?  That Katy Perry's  like me,  except with titties?  Yeah.  It's exactly what  she said.  Well, Katy Perry  doesn't have a  funny sitcom,  though.  No, she doesn't.  Which I also  started.  Yeah, but  like,  is the Katy Perry  movie like the  Justin Bieber movie?  I watched that  hunk of shit.  Everybody was like,  you know,  I don't like  Justin Bieber,  but you gotta  watch this movie.  It's really  inspiration.  No, it's not.  Actually, the Bieber  one's a little bit 
[04:05:30]  better.  Well, then I'm not  watching this one.  Listen, it's time  to go.  However, Ron and  Fez are coming up  next, so stay tuned  for that.  Goodbye, everybody.
