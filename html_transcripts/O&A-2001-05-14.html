<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recap of their disastrous "WOW Road Trip" around New York City.  The hosts detailed missed deadlines, terrible sound quality due to poor cell phone reception and a loud stereo system on their bus, and excessive drinking.  Ronnie, a show staffer, briefly appeared in studio before heading off for a root canal.  The segment also covered Jeremy's disappearance from the bus and Stinky's various humorous encounters, including a bizarre interaction with a fan.  Michael Stipe coming out, Fez's girlfriend, and Fez's unusual habits were also discussed, alongside listener calls complaining about the abysmal audio from the road trip broadcast.  A limo driver from the trip also called in to share his experiences.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to predicting the outcome of the upcoming *Sopranos* episode.  Numerous listener calls offered theories about the plot, particularly focusing on Jackie Jr.'s fate and the possibility of multiple character deaths.  The hosts recounted a story involving Jim Norton's exposed genitals at a pub.  This segment also included the announcement of a "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest" and a "Get Whacked" staff contest, further promotions for the show.  More listener calls, further *Sopranos* speculation, and the giveaway of promotional items rounded out this section.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the HBO documentary *Living Dolls*, focusing on child beauty pageants. The hosts and callers expressed extreme disgust and outrage at the sexualization of young children, referring to them with offensive terms such as "little whores" and "streetwalkers." They described inappropriate behavior by adults, including a coach teaching girls to flirt with judges, and criticized the mothers' appearances and behavior, using derogatory terms like "white trash."  This section also included a continuation of the "Whack Pool" betting game on *Sopranos* character deaths and the announcement of the "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest" winners, with detailed descriptions of the contestants. Mick Foley called into the show during this segment.

Further discussion of the HBO documentary on child beauty pageants continued, with the hosts and callers using highly offensive language to describe the mothers' appearances, parenting, and motivations.  Specific details from the documentary, such as a five-year-old girl singing, a mother's home-built stage, and excessive spending despite financial hardship, were highlighted.  A caller claiming to have worked as a street-level drug buyer for the NYPD mentioned apparent track marks on one mother's arm. Audio clips from the documentary were played.

The focus then shifted to speculation about Rudy Giuliani's alleged impotence following prostate cancer treatment.  The hosts speculated on the impact of this on his mayoral decisions, and callers shared their own experiences with impotence, including one with a bizarre and medically inaccurate explanation for his condition. The discussion was filled with crude humor and sexual innuendo.  The segment concluded with mentions of upcoming show events, including a Radiohead listening party,  a discussion of the Robert Blake murder case, and a promotional segment for Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed and Pinnacle Monkeying Around.

The Robert Blake murder case was extensively discussed, analyzing details of his wife's death, alleged threats, the discovery of a gun, and media attacks on the victim. A New Jersey private investigator called in, arguing for Blake's guilt.  Audio clips of the victim revealed her involvement in potentially illegal activities. The hosts and a caller nicknamed "Steve" offered various theories, including the possible disposal of the murder weapon in a plastic bag. The conversation then switched to the changing tactics of New York City streetwalkers, with listener calls offering humorous voicemails related to this topic. The show concluded with an advertisement for New York Sports Clubs, the announcement of another whipped cream bikini contest winner, and unintelligible audio snippets.

[00:00:00]  102.7 WNAW, the latest from Tool, Anthony.  Yes, Tool.  Kisnam.  From Lateralex.  The CD comes out, what, tomorrow, right, Ben?  Yes.  Can't wait.  We got our copies in the office.  We've been cranking the whole CD all day long today.  And, of course, they're playing this coming Sunday night,  a bunch of us from the show going to see Tool.  Pool.  Rock.  I think we got some copies of the latest Tool CD,  courtesy of Volcano Entertainment.  Yeah.  The Ladder Alex will be available in stores tomorrow, 
[00:00:30]  but we got five copies right now.  Awesome.  Five random callers get Tool CD.  212-757.  Follow Bobby.  1027.  Yeah.  What?  Sorry, I was off mics.  I had to yell like an idiot.  What a weekend.  They're telling me.  They're telling me.  The L&A Show.  212-757-1027. 
[00:01:00]  Look who's in the studio to say hi real fast, Anthony,  because Ronnie's got to go get his root canal done.  Get my canal done.  Ouch.  That's right.  We're running fast in for O.P. and Anthony.  We're on the WOW Road Trip, boss.  And it's coming into Paramus any minute now.  Well, we want to recap our Cluster F that was called the...  What did we call that mess?  The WOW Tour?  The WOW Cluster F.  Road Trip.  Yeah.  Road Trip. 
[00:01:30]  The WOW Cabin.  Whatever you wanted to call it.  We called it a mess.  You know, having done it, I think there are a few things.  You know, you need a shakedown, right?  That's what it was.  You shake it down.  You then look at everything, analyze it, find the pros and cons,  the pluses and the minuses of the whole thing.  And then you do it again maybe someday with the changes in place  that might make it a better event.  We put it on the lathe now.  Now we put it on the lathe.  On the lathe.  On the lathe.  I'll shut up.  Move the edges.  Yeah.  I mean, each time you get it until you're ready to put the fine sandpaper on it. 
[00:02:00]  I think it would work better if you guys did not leave the studio.  And just did the whole thing.  That's a good idea.  We'll write that down.  Take that into consideration.  And you know what?  You guys got it made on paper.  Looked like a good idea.  It seemed like a good blueprint.  It seemed like it was going to fly.  But Ronnie was funny in the back office.  He's like, you guys were X from the beginning.  I mean, you were supposed to be at City Hall at 1240 on Friday.  You guys didn't even leave the building until 1240.  So you were playing catch up the whole afternoon. 
[00:02:30]  It's an hour later and we're in Times Square still.  We knew our schedule was just shot.  You're not stopping for people.  You're just like the movie Speed.  It's like, yeah, we can't slow down under 50.  It would have blown up.  So we were throwing stickers out the window.  But the few places we did stop.  Unbelievable response from the crowd.  My God.  You know, just from a technical point of view, guys.  All right.  Yeah.  Turn your radio down.  Yeah.  You don't know.  You've never been on that side of it before. 
[00:03:00]  I know you're a long time listener.  But first time calling.  Exactly.  But you should know that.  You know, that's funny you say that.  Because we bitch and complain all the time.  And you're right.  We had the stereo cranked in that bus.  And ants yelling the F word at us.  Dropping the F bomb.  Did I?  Yeah.  Remember we did a little silent game to you guys?  Oh, right.  Yeah.  That's the only way to fight the silent game.  The only way to beat it.  I know how to beat the silent game.  Yeah.  That's silent.  We dropped the F bomb.  I hate that.  Maybe also two kegs of beer in the back of the bus.  Right. 
[00:03:30]  Maybe only one next time.  Now, a couple times we thought you guys were doing a silent game to us, but the phones  just scrapped out.  Yeah.  We're going to run for damn it.  Opie.  Opie.  Anthony.  Joe, don't do this to us now.  Gone.  I know.  We were just gone.  I think it's still, when you look at everything, I think we had fun.  Yeah.  How the Velvet Mafia, the bosses handled this whole thing.  I know they were out hanging with the bad boys.  We had a couple of people there.  We had Jeremy who joined us for a little while and then he left. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  He just disappeared off the bus.  Sure.  The other kid that got left behind at the field trip.  Right.  Just left him.  He's still wandering around the mall.  Yeah.  We've got to find him a girl.  You think so?  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to find him somebody.  That might help.  Yeah.  Sure.  Good luck.  What are you saying, Opie?  I'm just saying good luck.  He's too busy running with fish.  Right.  Yeah.  He's busy.  He's married to his work.  Right.  True. 
[00:04:30]  Just like Fezzy.  Yeah.  My work's named Bill.  No.  Fez has that fiancee.  Yes.  Right.  In Magna Falls, Ontario, Canada.  Of course.  Yeah.  She does keep several clothes at my place though.  All right.  Also has a size 42 waist.  Relationships are based on what you have in common.  Some separate.  Waist side.  Sometimes Fez will go out shop before he tries on the dress himself.  Wear it around for a while because he misses her.  Right.  He misses her.  Whatever works to get you through. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, Fezzy, any thoughts on Michael Stipe coming out of the closet finally?  Who knew?  What a shock.  Who knew?  That was a shocker.  That was a shocker.  When I read it in the paper today, I'm like, about time.  Right.  And I'm like, that Michael Stipe?  Because I'm thinking of another Michael Stipe that I might not have known.  Right.  I'm like, R.E.M. Michael Stipe?  Because it just freaked me out to the point.  I still don't believe it.  Well, it's there too.  It's Totsie Turvey.  Next thing you're going to know, Richard Simmons is gay.  Yeah.  Well, the second he announces it.  He didn't announce either, hasn't he?  No. 
[00:05:30]  Knock him out of the closet.  I don't blame him.  No.  Keep him guessing.  That's our model.  Guessing.  And literally, every salesperson in this place goes, Fez, is he an ugly what?  Is he what?  Funny?  Yes.  Yes, he is.  No, I'm just saying.  Is he a little...  No.  What do you say?  What exactly are you saying?  What do they say?  Nothing.  Nothing, Fez.  People just...  Someone's going to get a size 12 pump right up against the head. 
[00:06:00]  These rumors don't stop.  People can be mean, Fez.  People are cruel.  Kids can be cruel.  They can't.  They can't.  They can't.  They can't.  They can't.  They can't.  They can't.  They can't.  They can't.  Anyway, guys, thanks so much.  Oh, thank you.  For us standing in.  Root Canal, huh?  First one ever?  No.  No, you're kidding me.  We're going on the Root Canal Road Trip.  You're going to do that?  Let's all in.  You're taking Fezzy for your Root Canal?  No, no.  A different kind of roof.  A different canal.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I got crystal meth teeth.  Crystal meth teeth.  I've been through everything.  Oh, really?  Crystal meth teeth.  Who knew?  Also, who knew that?  Yeah.  Well, I thought we could snort and snort and snort and everything would be fine, but...  Those teeth will dissolve into a chocolate bar.  Yeah.  You figured it would be your nose or something.  Anything but the teeth.  How does it affect the teeth?  It just starts to get soft.  Yeah, because he...  I can't have lips.  He grinded his teeth down when you're like...  Right.  Just in the back.  Remember, the best part?  When they take that little thing and twist it in like a screw and then... 
[00:07:00]  A little file.  Pull the root out and you feel it coming out.  And like...  And it just pops right out of there.  I already told him.  I said, I'll be using the N-word.  Really?  And I just started taking it personally.  Novocaine.  Yeah, right.  Novocaine.  Right.  Novocaine.  Let me talk to Tony real fast.  Tony, what's up?  Yeah.  Novocaine.  Right.  Novocaine.  Tony, what's up?  Guys.  Yeah.  Friday?  Yeah.  It was the worst show to a listener. 
[00:07:30]  I mean, you guys may have had fun in the bus and all, but the show sounded like crap.  Maybe you should get back.  Tony, we just wanted to take a day off.  No, I understand that.  You guys rule.  I love listening to you guys, but I couldn't hear anything.  All you heard was, like, bad cell phones and stinky screaming.  Yeah.  We heard dancers yelling and, Opie, I couldn't hear you.  I couldn't hear anything.  We figured a way to play hooky from our radio show Friday.  Well, you did a good job.  I mean, I'm proud of you guys. 
[00:08:00]  You guys, you know, you guys played it up really well.  It's just, you know, to us it sounded like...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  All right, Tony.  I'm not going to say it.  No, no.  You can say we sucked.  I don't care, but I'm cutting you off.  No, you didn't suck.  The show sucked.  It's our show, so we sucked.  So I guess you do suck.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  I think that you guys are at the point in your career now.  It's time to start crapping on the people who got you where you are.  That's the idea.  You know, you start to do like Elvis.  You show up for 45 minutes.  You slide and you leave. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  We are at the point in our career where we can call in a show every once in a while.  Right.  Just kind of blow it off.  You know, Sarah?  Right.  What the guy doesn't quite understand is this was done to get out and have some beers  and hand out some stickers with people.  We just didn't.  We could have done it and gone, we're taking the day off and we're going out and doing  this.  We met easily 20,000 of our listeners.  It was huge.  Easily.  We could have done it that way by just taking the day off and going out and having a best  of or something.  But we decided to try to, you know, let you in on what's going on. 
[00:09:00]  And it sounded like a cluster F.  You know why?  Because it was a cluster F.  So if you think of the show sounded bad, muffled, bad cell phones.  I'm yelling.  Stinky's wooing.  Can't hear Opie.  That was everything that was going on.  I blame Ron and Fez for calling us off.  Why didn't we do?  Yeah.  We screwed.  You wrecked the show.  You left us a tag.  Technically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you guys would have stayed till seven, then that would have been perfect.  It would have been gone down as one of our greatest radio promotions ever.  But hey, way to go for us.  Yeah.  Screwed it up. 
[00:09:30]  Thanks.  Screwed it up.  But all right.  Drunk live reads.  Why?  Because we were doing live reads drunk.  You know, it's not nothing that.  That's just what it is.  We let you in on the inside.  I thought there was some entertainment value to that show.  I thought so.  Whatever.  The next one will be better.  Right.  Friday.  The next one will be Friday.  Friday?  This coming Friday.  Ha ha ha.  All right.  But I want to thank Ron and Fez.  They killed for us Friday.  Thank you guys.  Thank you.  I gotta go now too. 
[00:10:00]  We do love these guys.  Make sure you listen to them noon to three before us, of course.  There's a reason why we like Ron and Fez.  And even if you don't listen to us, just tell people that you do.  Yeah.  Hey.  That's all nice.  Oh yeah, I love those guys.  That's all nice.  You gonna get the gas?  Do you get the nitrous?  Um, yeah.  You get that?  Will there be a Dan Mason or someone nearby to make sure you don't blurt out any CBS secrets  under anesthesia?  No?  I'm gonna have the gas on the train.  On the train?  On the way back.  It's a personal thing.  I carry a tank with it. 
[00:10:30]  That's very good.  How did I be early?  All right, guys.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, Howard A.  There we go.  Ron and Fez.  There we go.  Hopping on the...  No, Fez, you better leave too.  Hopping on the raft, paddling back.  You need a sapper, Ron.  To the reef.  There he goes.  Ron and Fez.  What a pisser.  That was fun.  That really was a lot of fun for Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  What I was gonna say, there's a reason why we like Ron and Fez.  First of all, very talented.  Yes.  Very good radio show.  And very different sounding than us.  Right. 
[00:11:00]  Which is very important if you're trying to, you know, build a radio station like we're  trying to build around here.  Yeah, the shows have to sound different, have personalities of their own, have their own  bits and whatnot and not overlap with stuff.  That's all.  That's all we're trying to say.  And Ron and Fez definitely do that.  You could do the same stories, you know, you can't make up new news by 3 o'clock.  But the way you handle certain stories, certain teeth, just be an original spin on it with  the way you handle them.  They have a very different style than us. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Hopping?  Yes, Anthony?  So I just gotta quickly say hi to a couple of brand new friends of mine.  Oh.  From Bay Ridge Nissan.  Oh.  Yes, as you know, Anthony's lease is up.  Looks like you'll be driving a Nissan in the very near future.  Ah.  Ah.  Call me.  Val and Mike down at Bay Ridge Nissan.  Thank you.  Call me Kreskin.  You are.  You read my mind.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, so they're very courteous and cordial.  And yeah, looks like I'm gonna be in a new vehicle. 
[00:12:00]  Right on.  So take the APB off of the Mercury.  Let's go to Chamberlain.  Chamberlain, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  You know, these guys calling in saying the show sucked and whatnot, you had a sound quality  problem.  There's nobody else out there going out to meet their listeners.  I mean, 20,000 people, you guys are hitting the streets.  Who else is doing that?  Well, because we really care about you guys.  I know.  And you know something?  It's a little selfish too.  We were having a pisser. 
[00:12:30]  Is what it was.  You know what?  It's not work to go out and hang with you guys.  We end up having a ball.  Yeah.  That sounds good to me.  I'd like to get painted with drugs.  Not that S word.  S face.  S face.  Or just face.  All right.  Thank you, Chamberlain.  How's it going, guys?  We've done pictures from the WOW road trip on WNEW.com, SoundyMusic.com, OPAnthony.com,  I believe.  Yeah, you know.  They're all over the place, so.  And one of the other heroes of Friday, Norton. 
[00:13:00]  Jim Norton?  Goddamn Jim Norton.  Was so funny with the call-ins.  And then when we got to the Dublin Pub, I can't even tell you what was going on there  with Norton.  You could say.  Do you want to give him a chance to say it?  Yeah.  If he's around, sure.  I'll tell you this.  He pointed to something that was floating in the keg ice, and all he said is, she didn't  swallow. 
[00:13:30]  Let's just put it this way.  It wasn't a jellyfish.  No.  It wasn't a jellyfish.  Wow.  I was on Brother Weasel's show Saturday night, and I talked about this a little bit.  You probably weren't listening, so I'll tell you again.  I saw Norton's hog at the Dublin Pub.  Ah, and I guess I'm his friend now, because I never understood why all his friends would  say, yeah, I've seen Norton's hog.  Wow.  And they said it like it's no big deal.  Yeah.  I'm at the bar at Dublin Pub in New High Park. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Some sick F was buying shots like crazy over there.  Tell me about it.  And I turn, I turn with my shot, and Norton's kind of with a group of us, and he's laughing  like a little school girl.  Yeah.  Uncontrollably, right?  I look down, and he's just standing there with his junk just hanging out.  What was wrong with it?  For everyone to see.  It was hilarious.  Why would he do that?  Because he's out of his effing mind, is why.  He's standing with his hog out.  Just, but, but what he does is he was like this, right? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And he was just seeing how long it took for someone to notice that he has his junk just  hanging out of his zipper.  Oh, my God.  I was laughing so effing hard.  And then other people caught on.  They started screaming.  He's out of control, man.  Can we get him on the show today?  Yeah.  See if he's around.  Yeah, because we got to see what he, you know, what, what he thought of the whole mess.  Fat Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[00:15:00]  What's up?  First off, Ron Pettis did a great job, and so did you guys.  Yeah, definitely Ron Pettis.  I met you guys at the Dublin Pub.  Bob, I happened to bump into Stinky.  I asked him if he wanted to go buy one.  Oh, yeah?  So we did.  Oh, cool.  That kid's a pisser, man.  Stinky's a lie.  At one point, National County cops were driving by, and he drops the bowl out of the window.  He goes, oh, no.  Stinky's out the window.  I said, all right, man.  It's cool.  Don't worry.  Thank you, Bob.  All right.  Stinky's really happy today, because we went for coffee.  Yeah.  And we're walking back to the station, and this, Ben, she's pretty hot, right? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Pretty hot girl on the corner.  She just looks at Stinky and goes, do I know you?  And she's, like, just looking all confused as Stinky.  And Stinky, you didn't know really what to say.  Nothing.  Because she was, like, just standing at the corner, nodding her head.  Yeah.  Everybody.  Stinky.  Do I know you?  So I turn to the girl.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The bus looks like a crime scene.  Oh, all right.  We'll talk about the bus in a second.  So I go to the girl. 
[00:16:00]  I go, yeah, that's Stinky from the Opie and Anthony show.  And she goes, oh, that's how I know you.  But he didn't know you.  No, no.  You're telling her he's Stinky from the Opie and Anthony show.  He knows Stinky.  He doesn't know you were telling her that.  No, that's all right.  It's a strange thing.  And then she's, like, jumping up and down.  She's all happy.  Like, oh, yeah, okay.  Oh, yeah.  Who unloaded the bus when it came back here?  I know.  Here's the deal.  The bus finally pulls up after the ride from the Dublin pub back to here, where I think the brunt of the last push of alcohol abuse was done. 
[00:16:30]  I heard it got ugly.  Well, it got off the bus.  I left you guys after the Dublin pub.  You left the Dublin pub because you're going out to Long Island.  Right.  And you had a ride back home.  You're home.  I'm home.  We're coming back to the station.  I swear to God, more was consumed on that ride than everything else.  It was the last great push.  And we finally pull up to the station.  We look around the bus.  It looked like it had been ransacked in a movie looking for microfilm.  You know what I mean?  Just ransacked.  And it looked like the voyeur bus after the voyeur bus was pulled over and they had to tear it apart. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  So we're getting off the bus.  And I hear someone say something from the bus like, hey, who's going to do it?  And me, Stinky, and Ben are just like, oh, come on.  Keep walking.  Don't turn around.  Don't turn around, man.  Don't turn around.  So who had to clean that up?  Who knows?  Anyone?  Steve?  You want to clean it up?  Did you have to take the kegs off and everything?  Well, I made my getaway with you guys.  Yeah.  And almost was scot-free.  And then I was about to leave and Dan, the promotions guy, went, come on, man. 
[00:17:30]  You've got to help me.  Oh.  I was walking up the door and he just looked at me and I said, oh, Jesus.  Oh.  So you got stuck.  All right.  I said, I'm still on the clock.  Screw it.  Dan holding the whole bag as far as, like, taking care of, taking everything off the  bus.  So I think it was me, Dan, and Earl that wound up unloading the bus.  Well, that was the only reason why we brought them.  Oh.  To clean up our mess after we were done.  Oh.  Jesus.  It did.  I was joking when I said it was going to look like the bus in the gauntlet. 
[00:18:00]  No.  Actually, we brought him along for his sparkling personality.  Oh.  Jesus.  Well, what happened?  Give me cricket.  Two minutes.  Two minutes.  Two minutes.  Hey, have we heard from the bus company?  Are they happy with us?  Are they sad with us?  How could you be happy with that?  That's what I want to know.  The bus rocked.  Yeah, but it looks, that bus looks like the type of bus that, you know, you do a bachelor  thing.  They're probably used to it.  Well, I'm hoping they're used to, you know, everything they found on there, including  the jellyfish floating in the keg water. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Also, you missed the slam dancing on the way home.  Yeah, what the hell is going on there?  Nirvana's blasting, and you and Stinky are slam dancing in the aisles.  Woo!  Woo!  I think we blew out the amp, like, three times.  They cranked the stereo up so loud, you couldn't even talk.  Like, me and Steve at one point are sitting in their seats, just talking, and I swear  to God, we're, you know, a foot away from each other trying to hear what each other's 
[00:19:00]  saying.  The stereo gets cranked up louder.  I'm just like, I, I, and I had to mouth it out.  I can't hear you, Steve.  We're a foot away from each other on a bus.  And it's like real loud.  So then we just decided to scream at the top of our lungs the song again with everybody  else.  Oh, that's right.  Beer is flying.  Beer is flying.  Like, all of a sudden you just get hit with wetness.  And you're like, what?  And it's beer.  And Ben's just flinging.  He goes, ah, shut up.  I'm fine.  Yeah, exactly.  Ant and I are talking to each other. 
[00:19:30]  The next thing you know, there's just a spray shower of beer, and it's Ben throwing beer  on.  Like, Ben, relax with the beer.  Ah, shut the hell up, you pussy.  It's just a little beer.  It's not going to hurt, you faggot.  It's a belligerent bed.  It's a belligerent bed.  It's a belligerent bed is the best.  And Billy Mac on the floor.  What is my car?  Did he ever find his car?  No idea.  I left him in Manhattan.  He was hammered.  Didn't he leave his car in Brooklyn?  He left it at the Bean Post in Brooklyn.  And at that point, I thought I was going back to Brooklyn. 
[00:20:00]  So I'm like, yeah, I'll give you a ride.  But I wasn't.  And we got back here, and I didn't even see him on the bus on the way home.  Yeah.  Was he on the floor?  Holy Jesus.  I thought he got off.  He had a tap in his mouth.  He's out of control.  Classic.  Let's go to Zach.  Zach, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I just want to let you guys know, we had the same driver that you guys had on Friday.  We were on a bachelor party on Saturday.  A guy's name is Frank.  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  He loved you guys.  Oh, yeah?  Couldn't get enough of you.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, we were talking about it for about an hour straight.  He said he just had a blast driving you guys around.  It was a lot of fun.  Of course, I don't think he knew anything about any jellyfish floating in any keg ice.  But other than that, he said you guys were awesome.  All right, cool.  Thanks, Zach.  I think they're happy with you.  Speaking of which, Frank is on the line.  Let's talk to Frank.  Hey, Frank.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, there you are.  Yeah, I knew about what was floating in the keg.  I heard that.  All right.  I knew about that.  This is our limo driver from Friday. 
[00:21:00]  Bus limo driver.  It wasn't a bus.  It was a luxury limo bus thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what it was.  Frank, I hope you had fun.  I had a blast.  I can't wait to do it again, guys.  Nice.  Next time we do it, we're going to organize much better.  We're going to maybe just stay in Jersey for the afternoon and then north of the city one  afternoon and then Long Island for another afternoon.  Yeah, that's great.  Instead of trying to go to 12 different places during rush hour traffic.  How stupid are we?  I know.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Well, Frank, we're going to send out a really nice care package to you, all right?  All right.  My son said something about WWF, if he could do something for that.  Yeah, hold on.  Ben will talk to you, all right?  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for helping us out Friday.  Hey, no problem.  Anytime.  Coachman Limousine, remember.  All right.  Take care.  Coachman Limousine, right?  The name of the website?  I forgot the website.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I was waiting at Yonkers on Friday.  Yeah, we got to kind of discuss the Yonkers situation.  The email before the show today was ugly. 
[00:22:00]  But you guys got to understand, we just ran out of time.  Let me tell you the time we got back here.  We got back here at about a quarter to 11, and we left here at 11 o'clock in the morning.  As well.  Our goal was to get back here by 7 o'clock.  So we were four hours late.  No.  And that's without...  Hold on, hold on.  And that's with blowing off Yonkers and Flushing.  We had to blow off two areas. 
[00:22:30]  The big problem I had was with a black girl on the phone when we called up.  Oh, Keith was like, F you, F this.  You know, it was like, you know, we're waiting out there.  I mean, there were like 15 of us at the time.  I mean, I understand, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm sorry.  We'll get up the Yonkers soon, though, Eric.  All right.  I appreciate it, man.  All right.  We'll have more stories to tell.  Oh, yeah.  That's for sure.  We got a lot going on today.  We have so much to do today.  Okay.  Up next, Anthony, we're going to announce the winner of the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest. 
[00:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  Also, we do have to discuss the surprise a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of people are saying, oh, it's the last episode this Sunday.  Like, everybody I've talked to, I'm saying, no, there's two.  There's this one, and then next week's the big finale.  Right.  Don't confuse me.  We're going to have a Get Whacked contest amongst ourselves.  A little poll, a little office poll, a little office poll.  We're going to get into that next.  And, of course, we'll talk about that beauty pageant thing that was on HBO right after  The Sopranos.  HBO is brilliant with this.  They know right after The Sopranos, if they put on one of these freak show shows, you know, 
[00:23:30]  they had the Bellevue thing, and then they do the little girl thing yesterday.  Oh, the beauty pageant things, like the JonBenet Ramsey type of beauty pageants?  It was the sickest thing.  Yeah.  We saw Angela, too, on Friday, by the way, during our bus trip.  Yeah, we've just begun, so stay there.  212-757-1027.  We gave away the tool CDs?  That's all set?  Cool.  We've got lots of things to give away today, because we have a backup.  We have concert tickets for just about everyone that's playing this summer. 
[00:24:00]  So we'll do a few of those tickets today as well.  The wisdom, the wisdom of Opie and Anthony.  Unprotected sex good, cigarettes very good.  1027-WNW.  1027-WNEW is.  The Sports Guys at 5 AM.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  On the next time, on a very special Ron and Fez. 
[00:24:30]  Ron and Fez reflect on childhood memories.  When I was a kid, I lost my favorite doll baby.  I cried and cried.  When I was eight, I lost my favorite pocket knife.  Oh, why'd you leave it?  And a dead horseback.  Are they keeping it as evidence?  Yeah.  All on the next Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1027-WNEW.  Anthony, which one are we doing this time around?  Horny Goat Weed.  Horny Goat Weed?  Alright, Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  The fine people at Pinnacle have a way to spice up that sex life of yours. 
[00:25:00]  It might be getting a little sluggish.  It's called Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Stuff's for real.  It's Horny Goat Weed.  And there's other Horny Goat Weeds out there, but go for Pinnacle.  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  It's the name of the herb.  It comes from China.  It's been used for thousands of years.  Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed contains all kinds of exotic botanicals.  And what it does, it enhances your sex life.  So if you're having maintenance sex, or you're not in the mood anymore for some reason,  or you've been impotent for a year, let's say, because of prostate problems, 
[00:25:30]  instead of destroying a fine city, take some Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  That's not going to help the mayor's problem of finding out.  I know.  We'll get into that a little bit today as well.  Yes.  You nailed that, by the way.  You're a cranky guy.  You didn't nail the mayor, but you nailed the situation.  At least the mayor couldn't nail me.  You said close to a year ago that this guy just not having sex.  Was not having sex.  Was impotent.  Not having sex.  Right. 
[00:26:00]  But if you're stressed down under too much pressure, stretch down.  Get your ass down at GNC.  Get some Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Or call them up 1-800-899-5323.  This stuff's great.

Ponder it. 
[00:26:30]  Effin' Ponder it.  1027-WNEW.  It's the ONA Show.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  I guess we should talk about the Sopranos a little bit.  Yeah.  We got second to last episode last night.  It was a really good episode last night.  Finally, some real action.  Oh my goodness.  Tony choking Gloria.  That psycho bitch.  Oh my God.  What a lunatic. 
[00:27:00]  And that's kind of scary when you see stuff like that.  Because it's like, oh, alright, not that bad, but I think we can all relate to a psycho bitch.  Oh.  Oh.  When she's threatening to go to his wife when he finally decides to break it off because she's a loony.  Yeah.  She panics.  She goes, I'll call your wife.  Oh my God.  He's just ready to open the door and leave.  It would have been over.  Right.  I'll call your wife.  Click.  You shut the door and locks it.  I'll kill you.  She comes at him with a corkscrew. 
[00:27:30]  That was great.  Yeah.  She's got some trouble.  So we have one episode left.  And we have so many storylines that are not going to be solved.  Yeah, this is going to carry over into next season.  Socks.  That's my biggest complaint about the Sopranos.  They start so many storylines and they don't wrap up any of them.  No.  And you've got to wait until January to get any answers on anything.  Right.  Hopefully they'll wrap up.  I want to see the Jackie Jr. thing wrapped up.  I don't think that's going to wrap up. 
[00:28:00]  I think that's going to be the big tease.  Jackie Jr. and a couple of his buddies, three of his buddies decide they're going to make  a name for themselves like Ralphie did because Ralphie told him a story about how when he  was coming up he hit a card game that was going on in town.  It took all the money.  All of a sudden they had this newfound respect and stuff.  So Jackie Jr. decides he's getting three of his buddies.  They're going to hit a card game.  A card game, one of Ralphie's card games. 
[00:28:30]  It's his game.  He's on the take for this card game.  Now does Jackie Jr. know that?  Yeah.  He absolutely knew.  He goes, it won't matter.  See, it's even better that way because if we get caught, we'll just have to give some  of the money back and we'll have a name for ourselves regardless.  So they hash it out.  They pull up.  They tell the guy, wait in the car and don't drive away.  And they put the hoods over their heads.  They go into this poker game, draw their guns.  All of a sudden, who's sitting at the table?  Christopher's answer. 
[00:29:00]  When he turned around.  I just went crazy.  Christopher turned around like, oh no, Christopher's at the game.  This is bad.  Run away.  Just at that point.  Run away.  Cut your losses.  But no, they hold the guns on them.  They start taunting the guys playing.  The guys playing are taunting them back.  Like you don't know who you're effing dealing with.  This is small time boys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not much here.  And before you know it, gunfire starts.  And one of the guys gets shot, killed right in the chest.  Got his name, but just gets killed. 
[00:29:30]  Then everyone just hits the deck.  Christopher pulls out, shoots one guy right in the head.  One of the guys that Jackie Jr. is with.  And then they go running out in the street.  The guy driving the car, gun, goodbye.  He took off.  He took off.  First shot, he was gone.  He panicked.  So now Jackie and his buddy are outside.  A car pulls up.  Jackie puts the gun to the woman's head, drags her out,  takes off, and leaves his buddy there on the road.  Now Christopher comes out with one of the other guys,  puts the gun to his face, takes his hood off, 
[00:30:00]  sees it's one of Jackie's friends.  The guy's going,  Please, I'm with Jackie.  I'm with Jackie.  Point blank, right in the face.  Blam!  Great killing scene.  I love it.  Blam!  I love it.  So now the big question.  Will Jackie Jr. get?  What's happening with Jackie?  Right.  The way Tony left it with Ralphie was, Ralphie's a capo.  It's his problem.  If you want to deal with it by letting him slide, that's fine.  You want to kill him, you know, I'm sure it'll be a popular move. 
[00:30:30]  Tony told him without telling him, pretty much kill him.  You got to kill him.  But I'll leave it up to you, whatever you want to do.  So now, you know, who knows what's going to happen.  That pisses me off.  I want to see this.  I wanted that wrapped up last night.  Find him and kill him.  It's not going to be wrapped up.  That'll be hanging there all summer long.  I know.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  Two things.  First, he handed Ralphie back the gun that he gave to Jackie Jr.  Right.  Like a sign, you know?  Right. 
[00:31:00]  He used his gun.  Right.  Secondly, Ralphie already prepped Jackie Jr.'s mother.  Yeah, saying that Jackie was involved with drugs.  Yeah, and it's going to be like a drug-related hit.  Nobody's going to know.  All right, Eric.  Let's slow down.  David Chase is too smart for that, though.  So you're buying it.  It's going to be a twist.  I'm telling you.  He's making everyone believe that it's as easy as making it look like Jackie Jr. OD'd  or something.  Well, not OD'd.  I'm sure they're going to find him somewhere, but it's going to be like a drug hit.  You know?  Nobody gets the blame. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  That's what he's setting it up like.  That's what David Chase is setting it up to be, but you've got to give the guy more  credit.  He has a way-  You've got to give him some credit, Mikey.  Right.  He has a way of tricking us with these storylines.  Later, guys.  All right.  I just got to see it.  I got to see it.  I got to see it.  There's no way he could live through this.  And Christopher's livid pissed.  Like, he went to Tony.  He goes, I'll find him tonight.  And he's bad.  It's over.  And Tony told him to calm down.  And now Christopher's all pissed off. 
[00:32:00]  Really bad.  Because Christopher's been getting crapped on, and now he's starting to come into his own  and he really wants to make a name for himself.  And he can't have this punk busting in on one of the games he's at, shoot up the place,  and not have any retribution.  Right.  Without a doubt.  He'll look like a chump.  Jason, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  What the hell was going on at the end of that episode?  Tony didn't think that guy was getting killed when he went into his car talking to his wife.  You know, that was a great scene, because you're right.  As soon as he went over the hill, I was expecting a big car bomb.  But once again, David Chase played it perfectly. 
[00:32:30]  I think it's more they were trying to just show, look at this guy.  He just threatened this woman's life.  He wouldn't have had no problem shooting Tony's psycho girlfriend and leaving her there to die.  And the next scene, he's talking to his wife about what he's bringing home and pulls away in his car.  You know, it's like the whole gangster family guy thing.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Take it easy, man.  So, even though this is a sick F mobster, he's pretty vulnerable to it.  They're all guys.  You know what's screwed up, though, now?  You ruined the Sopranos for me. 
[00:33:00]  Part of it, Opie.  The eating thing?  No.  Now, every time they switch scenes and Tony is sitting in the shrink's office, I just go,  Oh!  I do that every time!  Enough!  You know what I do?  Enough!  I switch to the office.  I look at the clock and I'm like, Oh!  How many minutes are they going to waste?  I know.  They're wasting it in the shrink's office.  We only have 20 minutes left.  Someone's got to die.  They're in the shrink's office again.  Get out in the street or something.  Get to the Bing somewhere but the shrink's office.  I can understand if it's something integral with the storyline. 
[00:33:30]  But now it's like they've got to give the shrink bitch some camera time so they write in a scene and leave it in like that.  You don't really need it.  You need one shrink scene less than two minutes long every week.  Done.  That's it.  I'll accept that.  That's it.  We get it.  Tony has problems.  We get it.  We get it.  I don't need to sit there and listen to her whining.  It's kind of funny when Tony curses and gets a few cool whines in there when he sits in the shrink's office.  But for the most part when it comes on I just go, 
[00:34:00]  What happened to the sexual tension between those two?  It's over now.  That's what they were playing up last season, really.  It's over now.  Ron, what's up?  What's up, ONA?  Hey.  Yo, do you think they're leaving all these storylines up?  Because you know they're going to leave something for next season.  Are they leaving too much open?  I think so.  It's getting too damn confusing.  The last five weeks have all ended differently to end all these storylines.  They're going to have to kill half the cast.  Yeah.  They start a lot of storylines and you just want some closure to some of this crap. 
[00:34:30]  Well, what's going to happen to the rapist?  Where the hell did he go?  I know.  That's another thing.  Where the hell is he?  That's not getting taken care of.  And that could have been a quick little five minute thing to spice up one of the episodes.  Let's kill the rapist.  Send somebody into the shop and shoot them in the face.  I'd love it.  Unless the last episode of The Sopranos is going to be like the end of The Godfather.  Where, you know, everything settles on the last ten minutes.  You know, I can't see it happening like that though.  There's going to be a lot of gunshots in the last ten minutes then. 
[00:35:00]  There better be.  I hope so.  The Russian guy in the woods.  The Russian guy in the woods.  Paulie Walnut's a little shaky.  Christopher who pissed at Tony.  Ralphie.  That whole situation.  The rape thing.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Thanks a lot, fellas.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Meadow's black boyfriend.  They just blew that off.  Yeah.  Even though they broke up and all.  I understand.  But there seemed to be more of a storyline there they could have explored.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe she's knocked up and is going to have a mooly baby.  I'm just using the common terms and tongue of the show, I'll be. 
[00:35:30]  This is what's going to happen.  One person will be whacked or killed.  Or just die.  One?  You're going to need a couple.  One.  One is dying this coming Sunday.  That is it.  I love it.  That is it.  You son of a bitch.  That is it, my friend.  Trevor, what's going on?  Nothing.  Okay.  Hey.  All right, Trevor.  What do you have?  What's going on, guys?  Did you see, I was reading the Daily News or something, and they said James Gandolfini 
[00:36:00]  only wants to do one more season.  He thinks there's too much violence.  Oh, I know.  I think there's not enough.  That's not enough.  I think everyone knows that, but I don't think that's a completely done deal.  That's a perfect thing to do, because you know something?  They're probably the contract's up, and he's saying, I'm only doing one more season.  Meanwhile, they'll come to the table with some unbelievable catch.  Because everyone could agree, the Sopranos just exploded this year.  I mean, it was popular last year.  We all know that, but this year, it's taken on a life of its own, and it just exploded. 
[00:36:30]  I mean, they've got a couple good years left in them, at least.  All right, Trevor.  Thanks, Pat.  Bye.  Let's go to Frank, who's next on WNEW.  Frank.  Hey, guys.  My brother-in-law has a friend that said Galdofini doesn't want to do the season.  That's true.  Next season's the last season.  Right, right, right.  How many times have you heard that in the industry, where the people, the star of the  show goes, I don't want to do another season?  Excuse me, how long has David Duchovny said that? 
[00:37:00]  He's still popping his head on the X-Files.  Well, listen, check it out.  They said that the season finale for next year is going to be in the movies.  It's going to be a two-hour movie.  I don't know if that's true or not, but that's what my brother-in-law was telling me.  It's not a bad idea.  Hey, think about it.  It's pretty good.  But then again, the X-Files movie kind of, I don't know, kind of sucked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was supposed to be a big deal.  We'll see, Frank.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  I love you guys.  All right, man.  Bye-bye. 
[00:37:30]  Let's go to Mark.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Last night when that guy drove away, after he got in the car, there was a bullet hole  in the window.  I don't want to know if anybody else saw that.  When the car was driving away at the end?  Right.  No, I did not see that.  I didn't see a bullet hole.  Take a look at it tonight.  After he puts something in the back seat, he gets in the front seat and he drives away.  Lower left-hand corner, there's a hole in the window.  Bullet hole.  Hmm.  Look at that.  Take a shot with the silencer or something, man. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Thank you.  This guy.  I hate people like Pete.  Pete, no offense, but I don't believe any of this crap.  Go ahead.  I swear to God, man.  I worked for a DJ company and I worked with a guy last night who does lighting on the set  and he told me what happens.  If you guys want to know what happens, I'll tell you.  Sure.  Yeah.  We've been taking calls like this every single week.  I'm willing to bet money on it, man.  I'll tell you what happens.  And none of this pans out.  Meadow's black boyfriend was supposed to be killed.  Remember that one?  Yeah, but this is coming first-hand from HBO.  I got it. 
[00:38:30]  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  You guys.  You want me to ruin it?  Yeah, go ahead, Pete.  All right.  I'll tell you what.  Jackie Jr.'s stepfather kills him.  That's coming from HBO.  Shut up.  All right, Pete.  Swear to God.  Swear to God.  After last night's episode, there's a 50-50 chance you're going to be right.  He either kills him or he don't kill him.  Would you guys like to put money on this one?  Well...  I'm a better man.  Funny you mention it.  Yeah, we're going to do our own money thing in a little while here, Pete.  But thank you.  Listen, Opie, I like you.  I'm telling you. 
[00:39:00]  Bet against Anthony.  I'm telling you right now.  Do it.  Thank you, Pete.  All right.  See you guys later.  Bye.  Dan from Hoboken checking in.  Is this true?  James Gandolfini in negotiations with Comedy World Radio.  I think Drudge Jr. scooped that one, right?  Dave, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  How's it going?  Yeah.  The consensus within the guys who work on Sopranos is, it's going to go the way of Falcons.  Two dead.  Two snitches.  You're going to get a couple of guys who run away and then never get seen again.  And it's really going to suck at the end. 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  All right, Dave.  That's what everybody thinks who works on a job.  Cool.  James Gandolfini will still be Tony Sopranos 10 years from now in the Bada Bing parking  lot on a motorcycle jumping a shark tank.  Steve McCliff.  Hey.  They'll be teaching shop class.  John.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Two things.  First of all, when that guy, when he drives the car, as soon as he goes down the hill and  he fades right out of sight, there's one car that passes going the opposite way. 
[00:40:00]  And then if you notice, a Mercedes goes by.  Yeah, I know.  I've heard that.  He looks like the same one he was test driving.  And the popular belief is already is that he's in the car stalking him out.  Well, David Chase kind of set it up that way, sure.  And then also, with all the people who talk everything, the popular, a rumor I heard  for next week is that Ralphie will end up protecting him.  The kid, Junior?  I heard it's going to be the same way, and I think they kind of teased it last night 
[00:40:30]  in the preview.  But, John.  Ralphie's going to hide him.  That's pretty obvious, too.  It could easily go that way.  We know that.  True.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Because Ralphie wants Tony so bad it's not even funny.  How about Christopher's girlfriend and the tennis instructor?  What happened?  We were psyched to see something happen there.  I would have loved to have seen maybe a nice a la HBO lesbo scene.  All right.  You know what?  You bring up a good point.  I've got a homework assignment for someone on instant feedback.  List all the storylines that just disappeared from this season on The Sopranos. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  You'd be amazed.  Forgot about.  You'd be amazed how many storylines they just completely dropped.  The feds taping and then losing the bug and that story just...  What about Meadow's psychotic roommate?  Meadow's psychotic roommate gone.  Just all of a sudden written out of the show.  They were setting up some things there for a while.  Yeah.  Marriott.  Yeah.  Hey.  Another story line involves that guy last night that was supposed to just shoot that girl.  Do you remember when in the beginning of the season he was pissed off that they killed his 
[00:41:30]  twin brother?  Yeah.  And he came to Tony's house.  He was going to shoot him.  Yeah.  He just disappeared?  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  There's another story line.  Ah.  He was right outside the house with a gun.  Yeah.  And he pissed in the pool.  Right.  Yeah.  Gone.  All right.  Listen.  Anthony, you messed up that story last night about Chris.  This could have a very important thing to do with the end.  Becky didn't say I'm with Ralphie Jr.  No.  He said he was with Ralphie.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Exactly.  Not Jackie.  Yep.  Chris will probably remember that and tell Tony.  You know what I'm saying?  I think they know what the deal was.  When he was saying he's with Ralphie, he's just trying to get himself out of trouble.  And they knew he was with Jackie.  Oh, yeah.  No.  No.  They definitely knew it was Jackie.  It's true.  Oh, man.  I forgot what the hell I was going to say.  Go ahead.  No.  But you guys are definitely right with all the story lines.  Hey, that bullcrap started last season.  Yeah, I know.  Way, way too many stories.  I thought the series was the best the first year. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  I'm breaking up.  Thanks, fellas.  There's something going.  And then if they can't think what else to write for, they just forget it and start something  new.  But some of these story lines aren't even really that important.  So they can give you a nice ending that would kind of spice up some of these other episodes.  Wrap it up.  The rate thing would have been a five minute thing that you could have thrown in the middle  of one of these later episodes.  Well, that obviously is good.  That's got to pop up somewhere.  You could say that about a lot of them.  Story lines, though.  That's major, though.  That it's obvious that it's going to pop back up.  It's one of those things, though, that when you see her in the shrink's office, it pops 
[00:43:00]  instantly in your head.  What happened there?  That rape thing.  The rape scene and everything.  So they've got to take care of that.  It's not like every time you look at Christopher, you think of the story lines that just went  to the wayside with him.  But that's like one of those that stick in your head.  And what about when Jackie Jr. and his buddies were holding everybody up at the card  table?  You saw Christopher kind of looking at him.  Because he was the one that wasn't really saying anything.  Oh, he knew.  He looked at his man.  He saw his eyes.  No, we all...  Yeah, we went over that.  Right, right.  Oh, okay. 
[00:43:30]  It's not like it's a secret.  He knows Jackie.  Yeah, we don't know that.  He wants to kill him.  Rich, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  From what I understand, everything that's going on with Jackie Jr.  Yeah.  He's going to be the one thing that pushes Tony over the edge.  And it's going to, you know, cause him to basically bring down everything.  And I don't know if there's so much like turning foreman, but basically kind of like  do like a whole soul cleansing.  Cause now with Jackie Jr.  He kind of like, you know, broke the one promise that he made to his father.  Uh huh.  And that's going to, you know, and now with Christopher saying that we used to love him  and everything that, you know, it's going to kind of like lead to like a whole like,  you know, like, you know, soul cleansing for Tony and that's how it's all going to 
[00:44:00]  end.  Cause that's basically, he's going to self-destruct his own family.  Ah, that's one possibility.  And even when it first started, Jr. kind of hinted at the fact that Tony would do that.  Right.  That he would bring down his own family.  Right.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  Sure.  How about Larry boy wearing the wire?  Remember that little fat guy?  He was wearing a wire and that story just went away.  What happened?  Well, someone's going to come up with a whole list of storylines from the Sopranos that 
[00:44:30]  they just dropped this season.  That'll be interesting to look at all on one paper.  Uncle Junior's cancer.  They haven't talked about in a while.  Wow.  Is Gloria finally, uh, finally written out?  Hmm.  Does she come back next week?  No.  She'll be, she'll be back.  That's what you're saying about the ring?  True.  True.  True.  You're right.  What do I know?  Bernie.  Yeah.  Hi.  I know for a fact, uh, Joe Pantiliano, uh, Ralphie, he signed a two year deal when he  came on.  I'll tell you right now.  There's no way they could kill off Ralphie.  No, he's coming back and he's going to protect Jackie and they're going to get with 
[00:45:00]  Jimmy Sacks and that's going to start a war and, uh, the loyalties are going to depend  on Paulie and Christopher, but Silvio is going to have a bigger role next year.  Right.  And that's where the war is really going to be.  It's going, they're going to split into the two families again.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, we'll see.  That's a definite, definite possibility.  And, uh, I think you're right, Opie.  I think one person's getting whacked and I think it's the prick doctor because I think 
[00:45:30]  Gloria is actually going to whack him.  All right.  Thank you.  Uh, these are my three guys that I think we'll get, that are odds on favorite.  Odds on to get what?  Whacked?  To get whacked on Sunday.  Got to throw Jackie Jr. in there.  Mm-hmm.  Got to throw Christopher in there.  And I'm going to go with, uh, Paulie Walnuts.  Everyone else safe.  Safe, you think?  Safe.  Hmm.  Hmm. 
[00:46:00]  Hmm.  If I had a guess, I would go with Christopher.  I think they're going to blow us away and just.  That's a huge loss though for the show.  I mean.  That's my guess.  See, there's a thing.  It would be a great thing to have some of these people buy it, but it kind of is bad  for the show.  Right.  Christopher's got a good character on the show.  One's going.  One's going.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Maybe Christopher.  They got to end the season big.  I'm telling you.  One person's going.  Christopher kills Jackie. 
[00:46:30]  And then Tony kills Christopher.  He wouldn't do that.  You want to have a pool?  Tony turned into a pussy is what it is.  He could smack people around.  He could punch a bitch in the face.  We saw that last night.  But he could choke slam her onto a table or whatever.  Yeah.  But as far as killing people, I, come on.  He's shown weakness toward Paulie Walnuts, Christopher, Ralphie, Gloria. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  People should be killed.  Who else, Earl?  No.  Remember he was on the phone.  He was mentioning that his case was still pending, the retail case.  Oh, yeah.  He was like, don't kill anyone because that'll just bring up.  Yeah.  That was the thing he told Christopher.  Yeah, but that doesn't matter.  You've got to take care of business.  You can't just because you've got a case pending.  You ever did so?  What, Tony?  Yeah.  A moving yarn, charcoal briquette.  Chris, what's going on? 
[00:47:30]  I don't think Tony wants Jackie killed.  No?  No, he put the decision into Ralphie's hands.  And I think he's not going to get whacked.  And I think what happens is Ralphie's going to turn double on him.  And he's going to hook up with that guy from Florida with the fat wife.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think Tony just doesn't want anything to do with it.  He wants Ralphie to take care of the situation.  And what's, um, I think a storyline they ought to resolve is Tony blowing his nose.  What's with it after every line he says? 
[00:48:00]  I can't take this crap.  Like what's wrong with his nose?  You hear that?  Is that worse than how he eats on the show?  He's just really a disgusting guy.  He really is.  He's fat.  When they show on a bed with that hot chick, it's like, ah!  Ah!  He's eating.  He's always, like you said, flopping the stuff around on a plate.  Breathing heavy. 
[00:48:30]  We've got to get the whole show in here.  We're going to do the office pool?  Office pool.  Office pool.  Who wants in?  Earl, you got ten bucks?  We'll do this next because we've got to get Steve and everybody.  You guys can do this where you work as well.  We're going to go ten bucks a man.  I think everyone can agree that someone's either getting whacked or going to be dead.  God, I hope it's not Dr. Kennedy.  Or killed.  I love that man.  Dr. Kennedy. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  So we're putting a bunch of names in the hat.  Ten bucks.  We all just pick a name out of the hat.  Ten bucks to get in?  Yep.  The Whack Pool.  The Whack Pool.  Not like a circle jerk.  Don't get confused.  The Whack Pool.  The Whack Pool on the bus with the water that the kegs are floating in.  That's what Norton got on it.  That was a Whack Pool.  We've got to talk to Norton about the jellyfish that was floating.  Jellyfish.  The Portuguese man of war.  They got tendrils on it.  That thing had tentacles.  You're right. 
[00:49:30]  It was disgusting.  It was multiplying on the way back to Manhattan.  It was getting bigger.  It was just...  What the hell was going on?  All right.  So tell me if I'm missing anyone from our pool.  Because we only have like eight guys I think.  So we had to pick eight that are more obvious.  Well, this one's definitely not obvious.  This is the goof factor, I guess.  Tony Soprano.  No, I wouldn't put it...  All right.  Gloria.  Yeah.  Christopher.  Okay.  Tell me if I'm missing anyone.  Paulie Walnuts.  Yeah.  Jackie Jr.  Yeah.  Ralphie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  All right.  Uh, Gloria.  Yeah.  Christopher.  Okay.  Tell me if I'm missing anyone.  Paulie Walnuts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ralphie.  Artie.  Artie.  And Uncle Junior.  That's all I have really.  Do you have to be added?  What about the rapist?  I said Paulie.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Anthony Junior.  Anthony Junior.  Shut up.  He's barely been on the show.  Did you see the upcoming episode?  All of a sudden he's all over the little thing in the house. 
[00:50:30]  Something's going down there.  All over what little thing?  The preview.  You didn't see the preview?  Yeah, but what are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  What?  It's always going to freeze you.  All of a sudden they're showing there's a problem with Anthony Junior.  I think maybe somebody's going to take something out on him that they've got on Tony.  Yeah.  He was caught smoking pot behind the school.  There you go.  And his pops is mad.  Jesus Christ.  That is like the biggest waste of a character.  There's nothing going on.  He's just a miserable kid that listens to Slipknot in his room. 
[00:51:00]  He's my pick.  And Colchamber, which rocks by the way.  Colchamber is a sick fan.  The Russian dude that got shot in the head.  Uh-uh.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Then how are we going to do this?  A missing Russian guy?  You know what?  You put them all in there.  Whatever's left is left.  Is left?  Okay.  It's got to be.  A really good person that Nolan gets.  All right.  Which would suck.  But Russian guy.  Here, get another piece of paper.  Write Russian guy.  And you want to put, like, Noah in there? 
[00:51:30]  That's stupid, though.  Why are they going to come back to the Noah situation four weeks later?  The rapist, though.  The rapist?  Okay.  Here.  Put the rapist in there.  Put the rapist in and the Russian mob guy.  Anthony Junior Rick.  You're insane.  Here, you can have Anthony Junior.  I want Anthony Junior.  Give us the ten bucks.  All right.  You're insane.  They're not going to kill the kids.  Why not? 
[00:52:00]  They're just not.  Carmella would die before Anthony Junior.  Is Carmella in there?  I don't know.  I think she's got a better contract.  Throw Carmella in there because that lack of glory is...  Yeah, I do.  You never know.  She's the whole psycho factor.  You don't know who she might kill.  All right.  Throw Carmella in there.  Can you think of anyone we're missing in our little hat?  Janice.  Janice?  Could be, dude.  Could be.  All right.  Throw Janice in there as well.  And what about the guy last night that threatened Gloria?  I always forget his name. 
[00:52:30]  Let's put...  Billy Mack wants in as well.  Okay.  Let's put Hitman Guy.  Hitman Guy.  All right.  We'll pick our names next.  All right?  It's the Whack Pool.  You guys can do that at your office as well.  Kind of cool, right?  Sure.  We're going.  Also, yes, and we're an hour late mentioning it.  Figures.  The winner of the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yeah.  We promise we'll announce that next.  I swear.  Yeah.  You have my word. 
[00:53:00]  Okay?  All right.  212-757-1027 is our phone number as well.  Hello.  This is broken down, washed up, former WWF wrestler, current best-selling author Mick Foley.

[00:55:00]  Alien ant barman.  How are you?  Spook criminal.  1027 WNEW is the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  212-757-1027.  I want to thank Lieutenant Boogaloo for helping us out with some of the storylines from the Sopranos this season that they just decided to drop.  Yeah.  He's listed 18 of them and I'm sure there's a lot more.  Really fast.  Some of the storylines that have been dropped from the Sopranos.  Uh, the black boyfriend, Noah.  Mm-hmm.  The psycho girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's...  Something's getting pissed because we're not getting, uh...  Thank you.  Yeah.  Something's getting pissed because we don't know all the names of the characters. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Whatever.  I don't sit there with a pen and paper writing it all down.  You can't get track.  The guy who wanted to kill Tony, basically, when he was outside his house at the pool and peed  Pete in the pool.  Artie and Adrienne.  Or Adriana, right?  Yeah.  Adriana and the tennis instructor.  Janice searching the house for gold.  Janice and the Russians.  Yeah.  That was kind of...  Well, yeah.  Tony kind of took care of that, but there's still a little more there. 
[00:56:30]  The rapist.  Dr. Melfi and her own therapy, which I hate more than when Tony's doing the therapy.  I'd rather watch a Tony eating scene.  Tony and Lunch Meat?  What's that?  Am I missing...  What's that?  Help me out, Steve.  What?  He passes out every time he was eating the cup of gold.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, okay, okay, right.  Well, they kind of figured that out, too.  All right.  That was because he saw his father chop that guy's finger off. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  The pork slaw.  Paulie and the Russians.  Artie's divorce.  Christopher and Artie.  Uncle Junior's cancer.  Yeah.  I have cancer.  Tony and Guido the killer pimp.  The guy wearing the wire.  Tony and the Russian mistress.  Just a few of them.  What about Anthony Junior passing out?  Yeah.  That was a storyline they kind of just said, eh, this ain't going anywhere.  He has a waste of a character.  All right, we got everyone in here.  All right, are we ready? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Everyone playing?  Yeah.  We got seven people?  And Billy Mack?  Billy Mack, if you're listening, you should call.  Someone will pick your name out of the hat.  We're doing the whack pool here.  We got like 12 names, so a few of the names won't even be picked, so we might not even have a winner in it.  Yeah.  So I'm throwing the names in the hat.  Very easy.  Ten bucks a man.  We all pick a name, because I think we could all agree someone's getting whacked or killed or dying next Sunday on the Sopranos.  Season finale.  Winner will take all, okay? 
[00:58:00]  Who wants to pick first?  I'll pick first.  All right.  I like that.  Hat full of good names.  Hat's in front of Anthony.  It's the whack pool.  He's picking a name.  He's got a name in his hand.  Ah, Valeri.  I got Valeri, the Russian mob guy.  Oh, the Russian mob guy?  Okay.  Yeah.  Oof.  Oof.  Everyone's laughing at Anthony.  Do we get two, because there's twice the amount in there than there are people? 
[00:58:30]  Well, we don't have, we only have like, how many names we got in here?  Once again, we just saw.  Let me see here.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  There's 11 left.  We needed like 13 left.  We got three more.  There are a couple more.  No, let's, we only need two more.  Two more names.  Yeah, come up with two more.  You want to put, all right, why not? 
[00:59:00]  All right, but Dr. Melfi ain't dying.  So what?  You need a name.  Melfi's boyfriend.  He ain't dying.  You never know.  You know, the Russian, Valeri's not really a bad pick, because think about it.  If he, like, ended up in a hospital somewhere where no one could identify him and he's laying  there dying and stuff, and they find out and figure they could put an end to him before  he opens his mouth, I'm in. 
[00:59:30]  Look at you trying to talk up your name.  What about Furio?  Is he in there?  No, he's not in there.  That's a good one.  And Earl had another one.  Johnny Sachs.  Johnny Sachs?  All right.  All right, we'll put Johnny Sachs in there.  Not Dr. Melfi.  That ain't that.  Now he can each pick two.  Write down Johnny Sachs and we're in.  We got all our bases covered.  What?  Now he can each pick two.  Yeah.  Good.  We got to go around one.  Ben, shake this up, because I'm going to go a second.  All right.  Rich's just getting Johnny Sachs in there, and then we'll... 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Throw that in there.  Shake him around nice.  Let me go to Rich real fast.  Rich, what's up?  Rich!  What's happening, guys?  What's going on?  Turn down...  Rich, turn down your radio.  I'm sorry.  That's a delay.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Turned up the whole show.  What do you got?  Well, I do work on the show, and the ending is...  I'll just tell you this about the ending when the show ends.  You'll be incredibly disappointed.  I won't tell you exactly what happens, but I'll tell you that Jackie Jr. does get killed 
[01:00:30]  next week.  I'll tell you that Ralph and Paulie have like a fight, and Tony sides with Ralph, which  that sounds a little bit of a twist.  But I'm not going to tell you exactly what happens next year, but I will tell you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't believe any of these stories.  And if you guys are all pissed off in your cars, don't worry, because now we've heard...  No, dude. 
[01:01:00]  I was at the funeral home when they filmed Christopher in the casket.  No, it's no...  I mean, we've heard four different people now, and everyone swears that's the truth, so don't  worry about it.  I'm picking a name.  It's the Whackpool, Anthony.  Well, that's a good one.  What about the kid that was driving the getaway car that left?  What was his name?  That's a good one.  Who'd you get?  Uncle Junior.  Uncle Junior.  And I got you.  Uncle Junior-y.  God.  Who's next? 
[01:01:30]  We'll just go around the room here.  Here we go.  Ben, now picking.  What do you got?  Ah, good one.  Paulie Walnuts.  Paulie Walnuts.  Ben, Ben, looking good.  Ben's got the Paulie Walnuts.  Steve, you're next from FoundryMusic.com.  Come on, give him a lousy one.  Steve always wins these.  What do you got?  Yeah, I rigged it.  Jackie Junior.  Oh, come on.  You suck.  Steve, you always get the favorites on these whenever we play. 
[01:02:00]  I'm tired of it.  I just put that in a hat in front of six feet.  I don't know how you're doing.  Rick, that doesn't count.  Put it back in the hat.  What was that?  Don't be an idiot.  You're looking right into the hat.  He's holding the hat.  You lying sack of crap.  We don't fuck.  You guys are fooling me.  Rick, it's all cheating.  I am not.  Everyone's gone.  Okay, whatever.  You rigging Puerto Rican.  You guys don't know what the hell's going on. 
[01:02:30]  Sticky's just upset because he's...  Hold on.  Sticky's looking at him.  No, no, no.  I want to picture that.  No, I know why Sticky's upset.  I want to picture that.  No, because we said we're going around the room.  So you did skip over Sticky, first of all.  Second of all, you're staring right into the hat.  Look at it all the day.  This is legal, isn't it?  This is legal.  This is legal, isn't it?  Hold the hat.  This is legal, isn't it?  Hold the hat for Sticky.  They're upside down.  No, they're not all upside down.  Yes, they are.  He's going to try to pull a fast one.  Give me the hat.  Give me the hat.  I'm going to prove that they're not all upside down.  No, now they're not.  They are not.  Oh, now he's turning them all. 
[01:03:00]  Here, look.  Give me the hat.  He saw through the little part in the back of the hat.  Give me the hat.  You're saying they're all upside down.  I didn't see anything.  I could see Furio's name.  I could see Ardeo's name.  Well, that's because you're looking into the hat.  This is legal, isn't it?  This is legal, isn't it?  That's why we're saying this is legal, isn't it?  That's why we told everyone to hold the hat up high and take one out.  And sit down, Rick.  How are you?  This is cool.  This is legal, isn't it?  I'm not looking at that stupid hat.  I can see the hat. 
[01:03:30]  Now we're having fun.  They're all bad names anyway.  Shut up.  Anthony saw it, I saw it, and Barry saw it.  Okay, whatever.  Think he's up.  Who?  Think he's up.  Think he's named for the wax pool.  Janice.  Oh.  You lose, you get nothing.  I see your legs coming.  I wasn't the only one, so relax.  I see your legs coming.  Dan was the one who saw it.  He was laughing his balls off because he saw it.  Now you're laughing at first when I was a rapist.  Now I got Ralphie.  Ralphie ain't dying, though. 
[01:04:00]  Earl?  Earl.  Earl, your turn.  What do you got?  Furious.  Yeah, he would have died at the card game.  Billy Mac.  Billy Mac, yeah.  Oh, so we've got to pick for Billy Mac.  Oh, do we have enough people still for Billy Mac?  Oh, no, we don't.  No, Billy Mac.  Sorry, you're not playing.  Yeah, Billy Mac's out.  It goes back to Anthony.  Back to me.  We should have seven names left in the hat.  Anthony's second name in the wax. 
[01:04:30]  Pull.  Give me a good one.  I got Artie Bucco.  Oh, man.  So you got Artie Bucco and who else?  And Valeri.  Yeah, the Russian Monarch guy.  I'm still feeling good about the Valeri, though.  I'm feeling good about it.  All right.  Man.  By the way, someone asked what if more than one person gets whacked.  Obviously, we'll just split that.  Oh, I got to split it.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  It would be good if we had the people you have done.  Who did you just get?  I am so done.  Uncle Junior and Carmella. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, you're out.  You are out.  I'm so out.  Oh.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  My name is sucked more than yours.  That's horrible.  Another good one.  Gloria.  All right.  So, Ben, you got Gloria and who else?  Paulie Walnuts.  And Paulie Walnuts.  That's not bad.  Oh, here comes Steve C now.  Steve C, who has Jackie Junior as his first pick.  Who now?  Johnny Dex. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  All right.  You got two all right names, man.  Pretty good.  All right.  Thank you.  Your next name?  Christopher.  That's not bad.  I like the Christopher pick.  Not bad.  I'll trade you Carmella for Christopher.  Who's up next?  Rick, man.  I'm Steve C, you're a lying scumbag.  Rick's second name?  I got the rapist again.  All right.  So, you got the rapist and Ralphie.  And Earl?  There's only one name left, right? 
[01:06:00]  Unless we did the math wrong.  Oh, look at us.  Tony.  Tony's the pony.  Can I change it to nobody?  Nobody gets wet next week.  No.  You can't change that.  So, who do you got?  Tony and who?  I got Furia.  I got Furia.  I might as well burn my memory.  Oh, well.  All right.  Write it down.  Somebody take the minutes of this meeting.  Make sure we all know who we got.  Steve, God.  Let me, here.  I'll read it off really fast.  Anthony in the Whackpool has Valeri and Artie Bucco. 
[01:06:30]  Did you have some?  No.  Okay.  I have Uncle Junior and Carmella.  Ben has Pauly Walnuts and Gloria.  Steve has Jackie Junior and Johnny Sachs.  Stinky has Janice and Christopher.  Rick has Ralphie and the Rapist.  And Earl has Furio and Tony's surprise.  And Earl just leaves in shame.  All right.  That'll be fun.  We'll see how that plays out someday.  We'll see what happens. 
[01:07:00]  I'm so done.  Okay.  We have to announce the winner of the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  It would be so easy to take a break here because we're late.  But we did promise, didn't we?  Did we promise that we were going to do it right now?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  It would be a real dick move if we went to commercials right now.  All right.  Let's go to the page.  And it would be a real dick move if we went to commercials right now.  This man didn't just set up.  Oh.  Just kidding.  You're horrid.  All right.  Here are the finalists that we've been dealing with. 
[01:07:30]  Now, Ben, write all that down.  They're conferencing outside the studio.  Three finalists left?  Yeah.  They are, in no particular order, Jesse, Celia, and Kelly.  Correct.  Those are the three girls that have made it through the cut.  All the other ones out.  Yeah.  Emily-Lisa came in fourth place.  Yeah.  Emily-Lisa out today.  She was out today.  Knocked out by a slim margin.  So I guess the three girls remaining all will win something fine. 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  Of course, first place, that trip to Hawaii.  Courtesy of Contiki Tours.  Isn't that great?  Second place is a trip down to the Jersey Shore.  Yep.  And what was third place?  Like a tool CD or something?  I think it was a tool CD.  Mustache ride.  Oh, I did.  I don't think we had that.  Knowing us, a tool CD, a Rocky DVD, and...  Ski.  And WWF tickets for, like, I don't know, a ski without blinding.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  We got the blindings from the last contest.  It's, um...  Well, it is third place.  We're really looking for the first place.  Second place to get a consolation ride.  Oh, no.  We got it.  Okay.  Here it is.  Third place is a gift certificate for $100, courtesy of WhippedCreamBikini.com, right?  Oh.  Huh?  There you go.  WhippedCream.  Yeah, you go to WhippedCreamBikini.com and you can spend some money.  Oh, okay.  You spend $100 at WhippedCreamBikini.com?  Okay.  Third place in the WhippedCream Bikini contest, Anthony, for the $100 gift certificate is...  Third place.  She was a favorite. 
[01:09:00]  Did very well in the voting.  Our own Jessie from the Voyabus.  You might remember her.  Jessie, congratulations.  Third place.  We want to talk to some of these ladies today.  I think we're trying to call them or they could call us.  Either way would be great.  Okay?  Yes.  Now, I guess we've got to go right to first place.  That's how they do it.  Yeah.  They have the runner-up thing and then now we just announced the winner and whoever isn't  announced is the second place person.  Right.  So now it's between Kelly and Celia. 
[01:09:30]  And Celia.  For the trip to Hawaii, courtesy of Contiki Tours.  Lopi, once again, it was the battle between the natural boobs and the boob job.  That's right.  And we know how that's worked out in the past.  But this time, a little bit of a surprise.  No, there isn't.  Natural boobs won out again.  Kelly is the winner of our best boob contest.  Celia with the fake boobs coming in second.  Or whipped cream bikini contest.  Excuse me.  Of course.  Kelly has won the trip to Hawaii, courtesy of Contiki Tours. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Celia came in second place.  She's got the long weekend trip to Laurel Bay Inn in Ocean City, New Jersey.  I hear it's really, really nice down there.  So there you have it.  We're going to talk to all the finalists hopefully in a few minutes here.  Right, Rick?  Yeah.  We'll get Kelly and Jesse and Celia on the phone.  All right?  Great job, girls.  You kind of tricked me.  I didn't think you were going to announce the winner there.  I was going to play a little song before you announced the winner.  Oh, God.  It's tricking everyone.  She was a hoo-er. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, who's the stripper?  Who did you sing?  That's not a tease for the next segment we're doing on this show today.  I don't know what else to tell you.  That's awful.  If you didn't keep HBO on last night after The Sopranos, you missed another unbelievable show.  Yeah.  That is awful. 
[01:11:00]  That is going to be our theme song for every other female-orientated contest from now on.  That was horrible.  That was horrible.  All right.  So once again, whipped cream bikini contest is over.  The fine Jesse, who turned 20 recently, one of our teenagers, no longer a teenager, she came in third place.  Celia with the fake boobs came in second.  She's got the long weekend at Laurel Bay Inn, Ocean City, New Jersey. 
[01:11:30]  And first place, quite frankly, she ran away with the contest.  Ran away with it.  Do we have official votes, like as far as percentage-wise, Joe?  She had more than twice the votes of anyone else.  Of anyone else.  And she got off to a great start.  Right.  In the lead.  Didn't give up the lead the whole race.  No.  Amazing.  When the voting started, she had nine votes, and Celia had two, and we projected the winner.  The ratio continued like that.  We projected the winner in our office right there after 11 votes.  How scary is that? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  When you do, and it's hard to explain, but when you do these type of contests, you can  see voting patterns.  It's pretty creepy.  And you can tell pretty early on who's going to win.  And we even think when some of your favorites get eliminated early and their votes then have  to go to someone else, they follow the same patterns.  So even though you're giving up one of your girls because she's out, for some reason,  Kelly's lead never wavered for a second.  We'll get Kelly on the phone, hopefully, in the next few minutes, okay?  And, of course, we'll talk about the baby beauty pageant thing from HBO Live. 
[01:12:30]  Ah, the baby beauty pageant.  As we go to break, let's...  Hey!  As we go to break, let's rock out with Drew Boogie.  Hey, everybody talking about the O'Kee and Anthony show.  We'll be okay.  She's awesome.  I know I'm a loser.  You're a jerk-off.  Hey, douche.  You effing tall.  I'm a tall. 
[01:13:00]  I'm a dumb twat.  Okay, pathetic.  Someone just shoot me in the head.  Back to you. 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  Hey, everyone.  It's your good pal, Silva Kraken.  Boy, I got a rock-hard one here in my house because I'm dribbling myself.  You're a rich kid.  I can't.  I'll bag anything with a hole.  Oh, O'Kee and Anthony.  Hey, let's go touch the children.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you.  Thank you.  1027 WNEW.

[01:16:30]  Oh, God, it just brings your energy right up.  Order the thing!  The 0-8-0-2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[01:17:00]  Hey, do you know what's going on with our contract?  No.  Not a clue.  I got not a clue.  A lot of people think we're playing some kind of wacky radio bit like other guys have done in the past.  We really don't know what's going on with our contract discussions.  I have no clue.  I'll tell you one thing.  It seems like the company doesn't really care.  Either way.  Yeah.  That's all right.  We got options.  I guess when we read things in the paper that the company doesn't care, 
[01:17:30]  when they deal with other people that get publicized like that in the paper,  I hate to say it, but I guess that was true.  That's how we're being dealt with.  I believe we have a little over two weeks left in our contract.  Two?  And we really don't know what's going to happen, though.  And it's not a radio bit.  We're not holding out for more money and this and that.  We just want to be taken care of, that's for sure.  But we really don't know. 
[01:18:00]  We have no clue.  No one has talked to us in about quite some time.  Well over a week.  It's been a long time.  Don't look at it like it's big because we really don't know.  I know we'll be fine.  I can tell you that.  I don't know.  No one's talked to me.  I haven't heard a word.  I just find it a little strange.  Is this like scare tactics, you think?  We'll scare the guys into the resigning?  I don't know.  Boy, that's pretty funny. 
[01:18:30]  So there's your update because someone on the instant feedback asked, and we don't know.  We really don't know.  We can either continue business as usual and maybe add a market or two, or we might have to take the whole summer off.  I don't know.  It's the way it is.  I don't know.  All right.  Anthony, hey, a lot of people on hold, they want to talk about the, what was it called?  The baby beauty pageant on HBO? 
[01:19:00]  I think it was called Living Dolls.  Living Dolls.  Yeah.  Where's that song that started off the show?  If this isn't disturbing.  HBO did a whole investigative report.  Yeah, it was like a little documentary on those beauty pageants that go on all over the South and out in the Southwest.  And you might know JonBenet Ramsey.  She was in these things.  All the pictures you see of little JonBenet Ramsey were taken from shows like this, where they take these little girls, talking three, four, five-year-old girls. 
[01:19:30]  Time out.  Yeah.  Less.  We found out last night, less.  There's an age category zero to 18 months.  18 months.  Where the moms are just holding babies that are dressed up and the judges decide who's like the hottest looking baby, I guess.  Just dress them up when they fly out of the womb.  But how weird is it that the category is zero to 18 months?  Age zero.  You got some of these kids, you know, poking their head out so the judges get a look at them? 
[01:20:00]  She's wearing a labia majora around her neck right now and she's looking wonderful.  Yeah, and look, she's got a beard.  You know what's funny, on one of them?  Sorry, go ahead.  We don't know if she's a boy or a girl yet because she hasn't been fully delivered.  Right.  No, later on, like 45 minutes into it, they're showing this one mother.  She goes, yes, this is the first time we're competing with hair.  Oh.  They got hair extensions for like a nine-month-old baby.  Her or the baby?  Which one?  Yeah.  Big patch. 
[01:20:30]  So, yeah, this stuff is going on mostly in the South.  I don't think you hear it up in the North.  It's such a white trash thing.  It's these women and they enter their little daughters in these beauty pageants.  And you think, if you think it's like, all right, we'll get the little kid and it's sort  of a prettiest kid contest where, oh, look how pretty she is.  Give her a prize.  No.  They dress them up like little whores.  They dress them up like strippers, like streetwalkers, like dancers. 
[01:21:00]  And parade them on the stage to try to look sexy and hot for the judges.  All the moves are to look hot for the judges.  Yeah.  They showed some of these girls that are four, five, six years old getting hair extensions,  getting their hair dyed and foiled, getting, you know, the whore makeup put on.  Whore makeup.  They're talking about fake eyelashes on some of these girls.  Big glossy lipstick on lips that, I mean, are for whores doing moves where they put their  hand on the side of their head, one on their hip and start shaking their ass, their non-existent 
[01:21:30]  little ass.  You know what?  It would be so easy just to go on the radio and goof on and say, wow, they were all hot  and stuff.  I thought we did that last night, watching the show.  So today, I was watching the show.  I was deeply disturbed that this is going on and people have no problem with it.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  I mean, what about the girls with no teeth and they're putting whatever they call me?  Nine-year-old boys without me.  Right.  They're putting the fake teeth in.  The fake teeth in.  So they'll look hot. 
[01:22:00]  Hotter.  But, like, you know, believe me, this is a subject we goof on on this show all the time.  I mean, it's so dark humor.  It's so, it's effed up and stuff.  And it's funny when we goof on it.  But to see like that, in real life, these white trash mothers treating their kids like  this, it was despicable.  You just watch these women and want to hit them with a shovel.  All the moms have problems.  That's obvious.  The first thought I had watching this, how did such ugly mothers have such cute kids? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Because they show the mothers and they're just fat, disgusting.  They're ravaged by alcohol and a husband that probably smacked them in the face.  Ravaged by alcohol.  Really bad.  Haven't showered in weeks.  They're all greasy head.  They're holding drinks and they're just like taunting, they're torturing their kid.  Stand up straight.  You smile.  What are you doing with your arms on your hips like that?  You look like a chicken.  Smile, I say, God damn it.  I said, what?  He's a five-year-old kid. 
[01:23:00]  You're yelling at her not looking like the whore you did at the bar 20 years ago when  you might have been able to score something.  Yeah.  Well, the whole show revolved basically around Swan and her mom.  Swan.  That mom had problems.  In a lot of the scenes, you could see the drink very close by.  Oh, of course.  And it wasn't just a beer.  She was like doing just scotch without the rocks.  I've gots the drink.  And then they're showing these kids all dressed up like little whores around their stepfathers  and boyfriends of the mothers that are picking them up and fondling them a little too closely, 
[01:23:30]  you know?  I felt sorry when Swan like went into her mom's boyfriend's arms.  I'm like, man, if that's only a matter of time.  And that one other guy that's in the crowd, the kid-toucher-looking guy, was like a smile.  He looked like a little faggot.  Oh, Martin Short?  The Martin Short guy?  The Martin Short guy.  His whole job is to train these kids for these pageants.  He didn't look like a kid-toucher.  He's got this mesmerized look on his face as he's watching the little girls dance around. 
[01:24:00]  And it's just like, you have to read his mind.  Anthony, I think you missed a point.  What?  You're right.  He was getting a little bit turned on, but I think he was looking at the little boys.  Oh, I know.  I'm just saying kid-toucher in general.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they have the little boys in these contests, too, dressed up like little Chippendale stars.  How much did the gay guy's daughter look like Jenna Jameson when she put in the fake teeth?  Oh, my God.  When she popped those teeth in and she's pursing her lips and making, like, kissing things, 
[01:24:30]  I'm looking going, effing porn star.  They dressed their little girl up like a porn star.  That's a freaking money shot face.  Well, you know, that was a bizarre story, too, because the girl you're talking about,  the real father, he looked like he was dating Martin Short.  Oh, I know.  They all lived together.  Oh.  They didn't explore that.  How's that from on top of our hole?  But it looks like the guy figured out he really likes men.  He has his daughter.  He's living with his boyfriend. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  And his daughter's in these pageants.  How about the sick bastard that sings to the girls?  Yeah.  We have that?  Oh, my God.  There's so much to get into.  But, yeah, there's a part of the competition where they line up all the girls.  And this was the category Swan was in.  So it was like the five- and six-year-old category.  They all look like little baby whores.  Right.  With the fake hair extensions and the dresses and the makeup like we went over.  And then there's a guy who has to be in his, like, mid-20s at least. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Singing to the girls like they would sing to Miss America.  Yeah.  And talking about, you know, you're the love of my life.  It's a love song.  With your awful little ass.  Right.  And your non-existent boobies.  Oh, we got it.  Here it is.  Is this the song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're singing right to your face.  All I can't believe is, well, I need to tell you, the first time I heard you, I knew you are the love of my life. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, I can't, I can't.  Did you like Mr. Chips singing to you? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  I knew you liked that girl.  Did she flirt with me?  Yes, she did.  He could have been.  I was really proud of her taking the best, she was in any better.  Holy.  Jesus Christ on a cross.  What the.  What.  Ladies and gentlemen, right down the date, I finally found my line.  This is deeply disturbing to me.  That right there is a crime.  That is a crime.  That's soliciting, like, sex or sexual content or something from a minor. 
[01:27:00]  And parents encouraging this kid to flaunt with the friggin' moron kid toucher that's singing the song.  That's twisted, because the kids have no effing idea what they're doing.  Did you flirt with them?  Yeah, yeah.  I whipped out my hair, a hairless peach.  And what do you want me to do?  You want me to take it up the key, sir?  I mean, what?  They're pimping out their kids.  24-7, I'll be.  Trisha, what's going on?  Hey, that's the part I wanted to talk about. 
[01:27:30]  That was the sickest thing I've ever seen in my life.  When he was teaching her how to flirt with a guy.  Yeah.  And then he did.  He was like me after a couple drinks.  He knew exactly how to flirt with that disgusting singer guy, too.  After a couple of drinks.  I mean, it looked like they're teaching their daughters their whore moves that they learned at the local gin mill when they were getting banged often.  Thanks, guys.  You suck.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh.  We have the audio where the guy, his whole job is to train these little girls for these pageants. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  He's basically telling them to flirt with the judges.  Oh.  Mr. Tim, he's singing to you.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  That's your judges.  That's my girl.  And da-da-da.  Look at him while he's singing to you.  La-da-da-da-da.  Makes my kid a little humbuck.  And then you're one of my oldest ones, and I want you to kind of get me flirty with him.  Yeah, you can do it.  That's it.  Yeah, because she starts making the eyes and, like, looking over his shoulder at him. 
[01:28:30]  And it's a kid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Let me go to Katie.  Katie, you're next on WNEW.  Hello.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Katie?  I saw a show last night.  What white trash.  Yep.  I don't see that going on up here at all.  Did you see the beginning?  I don't know if you caught this.  The mother's sitting there, and she's talking to the camera.  The kids are screaming in the background, like, Mom, they're taking me out.  Feed me.  Do something with me. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, you hear the kids screaming.  That's a great gig that Kid Touch Your Singer's got, huh?  Singing to a little kid in an auditorium that probably smells like pee, diaper, and crap.  Oh, that's awful.  I love the 85-year-old boyfriend, too.  Yeah, the boyfriend was, uh...  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Well, she was just using him.  That's like her sugar daddy.  There was, like, a trash house.  She had one car.  She didn't want to talk about the relationship with that older, graying guy.  She was just using him for his car so she could drive the kids to all these pageants all over the South. 
[01:29:30]  He's like, oh, Bubba ran away.  Bubba went to jail.  Yeah, and one of our kids was in jail at 14 years old.  Yeah, and the kid's name is Bubba.  Bubba.  Scott wants to know, um, when Mr. Tame, Tim started singing, Get Your Balls Out.  Get your balls out.  It's today.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That is horrid.  The guy looked like a Martin Short character from SNL. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, this guy cannot be for real.  He was so gay, I think he was straight.  Like, he went all the way around the gay thing.  Completely around?  He went around the gay thing.  Where he just snapped back and he's manlier than any manly man ever.  No one could be that gay.  Get your balls out.  Clap your ass up.  Clap your scrotum.  It's today.  I was made happy anyone's birthday.  And it's not even for July. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, God damn.  Turn it off.  Carolyn, what's going on?  Hey, yeah.  I had seen this, I think maybe it was last year on PBS or A&E.  It wasn't an HBO documentary originally.  So I've seen it twice now.  So I couldn't turn it off.  I was just fascinated last night.  And those two guys are so frightening because it's only their people that apparently are winning.  So they've got something over on the judges that the judges only pick. 
[01:31:00]  Well, those two guys.  They, like, run that circuit, it seems.  Yeah, but just about every single baby that's in that pageant circuit is trained by them.  Because they said something like three to four hundred girls are trained by them.  Oh.  This is a huge money-making scheme for them.  It's like they finally give Swan's mother some money and you know she's giving it right back to them for more coaching.  Yeah, you see the house they were living in while Swan's mom is living in some kind of crack den house in Fort Myers? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  And she wants her daughter to get a taste of that good life so she'll want it more.  So she'll work harder.  Yeah.  All right, Carolyn.  Thank you.  No, it's okay.  Come on now.  Make your eyes.  Make eyes at the judge.  Make eyes.  Oh, they haven't opened yet?  Okay.  No, that's okay.  You look hot.  You look sexy.  All right, stick your butt out.  Someone wipe it because there's baby crap all over it.  Go ahead.  Come on.  Just look at.  No, it's okay.  Flirt.  Flirt, you little bitch.  Two words, JonBenet. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Well, the one looked just like JonBenet.  Swan, that show was nothing more than legalized kiddie porn and the veil of a beauty contest.  It was beyond twisted.  You could tell how JonBenet was like a frontrunner in those whole things, though, because all the kids look like little JonBenets now.  Right.  They try to look like them.  I think my wife's been born.  Oh, is she on the runway somewhere?  That girl, Swan, didn't want to do that crap.  Remember when she wanted to stop the pageants so her mom could stop working so much? 
[01:32:30]  So what's white trash bitch do?  Get a third job.  You know what?  They should have explored the type of jobs the mom's getting.  Oh, yeah.  I think she's bowing for...  What's the line?  B-jobs.  Bobbing for dignity.  She's definitely bobbing for dignity, as Norton would say.  It's just horrible.  And you can tell these women, they're all the same friggin' mold.  They come from the same mold.  They grew up, they white trashed, they never amounted to squat, so now they've got to put 
[01:33:00]  all this pressure on their little kids and dress them up like little hose bags and porn  stars to get attention for themselves.  It's like that Munchausen by proxy syndrome thing where they poison the kids to try to get  attention.  It's the same thing, but only it's dress them up like a little whore.  And it's a no-win situation because Swan and her mom, and Swan is like a front-runner.  She's won a lot of pageants and stuff.  Yeah.  She won the big one at the end of this special last night and won $2,500. 
[01:33:30]  And then it flashes on the screen a little graphic that says, Swan's mom has spent well  over $70,000 on these pageants.  So they're never going to make any money doing this.  It just has to do with these women.  It's the women.  The kid doesn't, you think the kid goes, I want to be in a beauty pageant?  No, the mother's like, I'm going to use such a pretty girl.  And around the whole white trash trailer park, everybody says what a pretty little girl you  are.  So I'm going to put you in this contest.  Mommy, I don't want to, you're going to put that whore makeup on. 
[01:34:00]  And like, you're right, it's probably for the mom's self-esteem.  Of course it is, because now they've got something to talk about.  They've got something, my little girl done won the contest.  Give me another Scott, Scott, damn it.  Why don't we take a break?  We have a lot more clips to play from the special in case you missed it.  Yeah.  Everyone's on hold wants to talk about it.  Stay there.  We'll get to a lot of your phone calls next.  212-757-1027.  Open the air, then for me.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  1027. 
[01:34:30]  WMW.  Radio is a commercial business.  And you have to do what people want.  It's a load of crap.  We don't do traffic.  We don't do weather.  We do nothing.  Did you just say I'm trouble, then?  That's it.  It's like the worst radio on the planet.  Yes, we know.  Only and as in a show.  First of all, I'm just waiting for you.  I know my husband.  New Weezer in. 
[01:35:00]  That's Piper.  Weezer's album is out tomorrow, as well as Tool's album.  We gave away a few copies of the two albums earlier.  Right now, what are we doing, Ann?  We're talking about the baby beauty pageant thing that was on FF Sopranos on HBO.  And how despicable anyone involved in these things are.  It's like a little kiddie porn ring that they're running.  It's not like at a county fair or a local town has an event where they have, like, the cutest girl contest or something. 
[01:35:30]  And they look like girls, which is still demented and twisted.  And you shouldn't make kids compete like that.  But this is a let's dress little girls up like women, like whore women, parade them around with whore moves, and then pick a winner.  As men gawk at them like pedophiles and as women trying to make up for their own inadequacies in life,  parade these girls around and just torture them to try to get something into their life that they never had. 
[01:36:00]  I need to hear from someone today that will explain why this is okay.  Because I was just watching last night.  I was blown away.  I'm like, this is sick.  Well, the instant feedback exploding.  One guy, the only thing more revolting than the white trash parents and the raging queen coaches,  who really want to either be little girls themselves or spend the day playing princess dress up,  was the slimy emcee who was singing love songs for the prepubescence, 
[01:36:30]  all the while measuring them for shallow graves and strangulation.  Then Dan from Hoboken checking in.  Just think, Swan's mother probably used to listen to Mad Matt down there.  Well, they were from the Fort Myers area, and that's where Rick did some radio.  Dude, how scary.  I'm watching this thing.  I missed the first five minutes where it said where it was from.  So I'm just watching, and they show the outside of the house, and they show it all barren.  I'm looking at it going, God damn, that's Cape Coral.  I knew right off the bat exactly where the hell it was.  Sure.  Dre from Brooklyn, did you notice that one of the homos were fitting Swan with a dress? 
[01:37:00]  The blonde guy grabbed her right in the crotch.  Oh, I saw that.  And then rubbed his hand on her chest.  Yeah, he wasn't happy with the seam.  With the seam.  I swear to God.  There's barely a seam there.  Oh, you're talking about the clothes.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wasn't happy with the seam in front of a nice seam.  In the front there.  Mimi.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah, what's up?  You're on the air.  First of all, that thing last night was like a train wreck.  I couldn't keep my eyes off of it.  Yeah.  It was ridiculous. 
[01:37:30]  What is it about those southern states that all they do is want beauty pageants and dress  their kids up?  They're backwards.  I don't get it.  They're reparted.  Well, because there's a lot of white trash.  The moms have low self-esteem issues.  All I wanted to do was watch their little girl face.  And since they were getting pounded at 12 years old or whatever it was, hanging out at the  bars drinking moonshine with their uncle touching them, you know, they don't see a problem  with it.  Isn't there a child of yours, wouldn't you say?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:38:00]  It was so sick.  I can't believe they're not shutting these things down.  Because the kids are like, even someone's like, oh, mommy, I don't want to do it anymore.  And she's like, you're doing it until you get it right.  You're doing it because you ain't no quitter.  Give me another goddamn drink.  It was twisted to see the girls at like the beauty parlor or whatever you call it down there,  getting hair extensions and their hair getting dyed and stuff.  Well, did you see they put mascara on that little boy?  Yeah.  Oh, the mullet guy?  Mullet head.  The little mullet kid.  That tells you right there where this is happening. 
[01:38:30]  He wins the beauty king thing.  And he's got the mini mullet.  Mini mullet.  Mini mullet.  Joe Dirt's kid.  Little Joey Dirt.  All right.  I'll be checking in.  Did you see Martin Short?  The Martin Short guy dancing in front of the little four-year-old girl.  To show her the routine.  I laughed my balls off.  Yeah.  He does this whole routine that is so complicated.  Even like a girl in her 20s would have a tough time following the guy.  I know.  She's just looking like, I want to play.  Yeah.  Where's blues clubs? 
[01:39:00]  Did you notice that when they were dolling the girls up, one woman said,  Oh, I hear she looks like Jean Benet or Barbie doll.  Jesus.  A choice between an inanimate object and a dead girl.  Something's wrong here.  Brian, what's going on?  Yeah.  That woman last night.  Yeah.  You ever know she had the same shirt on every scene they showed?  Well, she was a, yeah.  She was just a drunken slob.  Like every seven months.  Oh, same black t-shirt.  Right.  How about the freak?  How about you all?  Because they're spending every cent on the little girl.  How about that guy?  Goes to the airport, right? 
[01:39:30]  She put the car to the airport.  Next thing you can see is Steven goes into the airport.  What are you, Jake?  Your bike?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Yeah, I blew that one.  Sorry.  That's all right.  We got some audio of the mom from last night's show on HBO.  Yeah.  Here's Swan's mom.  On one hand, you're supposed to be his nurturing mother figure.  On the other hand, you're going to kick their ass.  And it's tough coming from the same individual.  But we've managed, I think, to make it work fairly well here.  It is a hard thing to do. 
[01:40:00]  Do you wish it was different?  No.  Not in the league.  I'm the best dad I know.  Yeah, they're surprised the father's nowhere to be seen.  Jeez.  Yeah, I know.  Most of these, they were boyfriends.  They were stepfathers.  She's part of the Husband of the Month Club.  Here's Danny.  Danny, what's going on?  Yo.  Yo.  You know, with that kid, that little boy, they put the eye makeup on him,  and the mother's looking at the kid, all so proud and everything. 
[01:40:30]  She's destined to raise a little fag over there.  Yeah.  And then there's one part where that swan is running away with that little boy,  and the mother's yelling at swan, don't you go after that little boy?  Yeah, because she's already flirting with other little boys and holding her hand.  It was sick, man.  It was so sick.  There's another little part where she's telling swan in the hallway,  do the routine, and swan says, mommy, give me a kiss.  So she gives her a kiss.  And she says, mommy, give me a hug.  She's not going to get the routine right.  Get it right.  Get it right.  You've got to get it right.  You want affection. 
[01:41:00]  You want mommy to love you, you've got to do it all, baby.  That's right.  It's so sick.  I mean, it was repulsive, man.  Swan's mother couldn't afford a car, so she had a whole frigging stage built in the garage.  Remember that?  Mm-hmm.  She had a stage built, and she'd have her kid go out to the garage  as her 14-year-old half-brother would sit there and gawk at her ass.  It was so skeevy to watch.  Matter of fact, here's a song swan was practicing in the garage. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, good.  Let's go.  I found it for to see my glory.  Louder.  And I find I'm supposed to bring my child.  Don't keep raising your voice.  I'm locked in the jungle all alone in a mind when I need a lioness and hope.  Put it down.  Put it down.  And then for I have to be back in my own little corner, all alone in my own little corner. 
[01:42:00]  If you're high, if you're high, you've got to maintain the same tone.  You keep going up and down, up and down.  Some parts were better, some parts were worse.  You've got to keep your voice the same level throughout the whole song.  The king.  Let's try it again one more time, and then we'll switch to the next one.  You hear the mom?  She's already, you can tell she's sauce.  I just got chills listening to that.  That girl's five years old singing.  No, I'm glad. 
[01:42:30]  Don't raise your voice.  Do you like having your background?  Tim, what's going on?  Guys, you are so right.  I didn't watch the whole thing, but I watched the one part, and it said on the bottom of  the screen, you know, so-and-so spent $1,200 on a design address.  Yeah, a used address.  A used address, right.  She doesn't have a car, but she's spending $1,200, so that, you know, her little girl  looks more like a little whore princess with these pageants.  But even that, she could use it on her teeth.  I mean, if you saw it like the cartoons when they used to bite on the metal pipes and all 
[01:43:00]  the teeth would fall out, that's what they look like.  Right on.  But Anthony hit another good point real quick.  Where did the fathers go?  I mean, these kids, how did such fugly mothers have these kids?  Yeah, we said that earlier.  I mean, Jesus.  And then the Feggy trainer, like, oh, point your feet this way, and he's like throwing  his arms out.  Like, oh, please.  Who knows what these moms looked like when they were kids.  I mean, obviously, they've been ridden hard and put up wet.  You know what I mean?  They're like, they've just been run through the mill of booze and abusive guys and stuff 
[01:43:30]  and their own problems and their own mistakes they've made through life.  Now they try to make up for it by taking their little kid and dressing like whores.  Lovely.  Here's another clip from last night.  This one's disturbing.  Oh, and the others were a treat?  No, this is just...  All right, this is done, right?  Do you want your star earrings?  A little lucky star earrings?  No, I don't want them.  What happens tonight if you don't wear them and your team loses because of it?  Huh?  I don't want them. 
[01:44:00]  Okay, but if they lose, it's on you.  And you have a big responsibility, don't you?  Put your hand down.  Don't you?  I want them.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  If she's not setting up her daughter to be, like, you know, knocked up at 14 and I'm cracked by 16,  Kokuwa, this guy wants to defend the pageants.  Oh, yeah.  Mark, what could you possibly say to us?  First of all, it's not as bad as, like, as you guys are all making it out today. 
[01:44:30]  Making it out?  We're just playing the clips.  We're not...  I apologize.  I apologize.  I'll let you get your opinion out, but don't curse.  I apologize.  All right, why?  I'm just lying, man.  I know.  I've got to have a...  I knew it.  There's nobody that you're going to find in New York that defends these things.  If we were down in Bama, forget about it.  Karen, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  The woman before that said it was like a train wreck, it was right. 
[01:45:00]  The more you watched it, the further my mouth was just hanging open.  Listen, I can't believe this woman can't afford a bar.  They're having macaroni and cheese for Thanksgiving.  Her son's in jail, and she's spending $70,000 on beauty pageants.  For her five-year-old daughter.  For her five-year-old.  Yeah.  It's her drug.  You know, you could start your kid's education.  You could, you know, give your kids the proper tools that they're not going to grow up to be white trash that the parents are.  Well, I get an education when your daughter can be a nice little whore and be like her mommy. 
[01:45:30]  No, it's the sickest part.  The whole thing was sick, but the sickest for me is when they had the zero to 18-month category, and they announced the winner of it.  And the little girl couldn't have been more than four or five months, maybe six, maybe six months old, okay?  And they're holding her up in front of the judges.  She just won, and they're putting all the stuff on her and the crown.  And the mom is just freaking out, so excited.  Yeah.  The little kid doesn't even know it's alive yet. 
[01:46:00]  I know.  And she's all in makeup, and her hair is done.  That was so effing sick.  Well, did you notice that all the mothers were about 300 pounds?  They were fat, disgusting slobs who never probably had a guy look twice in their direction growing up,  and they're starting their kids in these pageants, you know?  I guess they're trying to live vicariously through their four-year-old.  How sick is that?  That's what they're doing, yeah.  You know, and this swan girl, you know, they should do a follow-up story ten years from now 
[01:46:30]  because I guarantee she's going to be living in a trailer park with two kids on welfare,  and she's going to be an alcoholic.  This poor kid, that woman should be shot.  They're telling the girls to flirt with the judges.  They're five years old.  Five.  Flirt.  You flirt, girl.  Flirt.  Make sure you make eye contact.  That looked good.  That MC that was singing to those girls,  if I had a daughter and that guy came within 10 feet of my child,  I would probably kill him. 
[01:47:00]  It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.  Was there one black contestant in any of those shows?  No.  See?  No.  It's not only bad for the kids, it's racist.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Hey.  Jimmy.  Speak.  Oh, well.  We lost him.  We have somebody here that wants to defend the beauty pageants.  What's your name?  No.  Here's another clip from last night. 
[01:47:30]  And do not scrub on the floor.  Listen to me.  You're going to have a headset on.  Anything noise you make, the headset will pick up.  Do not make noise.  One, don't do that.  I'll start again.  Don't make noise.  You're a kid.  Don't be that.  Nicely.  Spot, spot, spot. 
[01:48:00]  Your eyes are here.  Let that go.  No, quit throwing yourself.  Start again.  Oh, God, I just want to punch this lady in the teeth.  Don't you want to smack her?  It's a poor kid.  Let her play.  Matt, what's up?  How you doing?  I just want to point out how many times that Martin Short character said,  said, you go, girl, throughout this whole program.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  About a hundred times.  Oh, yeah.  That guy was so wrong on so many levels.  He's just a big fag, you know?  That's it.  And his boyfriend that has, like, a daughter in the pageant,  he does all the makeup and the hair extensions.  Right.  I guess they never addressed that, what that relationship all was.  Yeah.  That was really bad.  All right, Matt.  I think we're just about done.  Is there any other really good clips we want to play?  We have about 50 clips from the show.  But you guys can just watch it for yourself.  Lewis.  This is by far the most disturbing thing I think I've ever heard on your show. 
[01:49:00]  And the funniest thing is that it's reality.  Yeah.  Reality.  I mean, Anthony hit it right on the head.  This is a crime.  Hit him on the head.  Yeah.  Sorry.  What?  This is a crime.  I mean, these parents are...  What's that, Lewis?  Sorry.  We need some comedy today.  Comedy relief.  All right, Lewis.  Thank you.  It would be so easy just to completely make fun of him and goof on this.  But it's just... 
[01:49:30]  We have to go the other way.  It's just...  I know.  It was beyond twisted.  Don't sit and watch it.  You just want to smack the mother in the face.  Here's Shane and Michael, two of the guys that train all the...  Oh, great.  All the little girls.  We had a daughter that you wanted to compete in, Padgett.  She would bring her to us and we would get her ready from head to toe.  Her modeling, her pictures, her hair, her makeup, everything.  Her wardrobe.  That's what we do.  We've had girls over here that were just literally butt ugly. 
[01:50:00]  I'm being serious.  And we take...  It's the truth.  It is the truth.  And I take them, like I said, take their eyebrows off, put eyelashes on them, put hair, contour  here, contour here.  I'm talking to black out the nose.  Yeah, and they're beautiful.  And, you know, when you get them on stage and the spotlight hits them, which, you know,  like you said...  So, that's what I'm saying.  I can take an ugly girl and make her beautiful.  You know, you can't without me.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Not without me.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey. 
[01:50:30]  First, I want to say, I watched some of the show last night.  I couldn't really watch all of it.  It was really, really disturbing.  I couldn't turn it off.  Could not turn it off.  I was just mesmerized.  I have two little boys, two and a half and one and a half.  And I think that's why it really bothered me so much.  I had to turn it off.  Yeah.  I just want to know if any of you guys noticed.  First, let me say, I used to buy drugs on the street level for the city of New York  as a cop.  And a couple of instances, they showed you the mom when she had her T-shirt on, a famous  black T-shirt.  The light shone across her arms, and you could see on her forearms scars that used to be track 
[01:51:00]  marks where she used to shoot up.  I wonder if anyone noticed that.  I wouldn't doubt it, because when we were watching this again in the back office, we were trying  to figure out what she was on.  We could tell she was a boozer, and we were trying to figure out if it was crack or a  little H or something.  She's done a lot more than just drinking.  She's really hard.  She's really worn out.  Right on.  All right, Mike.  A lot of city miles on her.  Thank you.  It's okay.  Have a good day.  Another clip of the mom.  All right.  Everything I do revolves around these kids. 
[01:51:30]  Absolutely everything.  You know, from getting Bubba out of jail and trying to figure out what his problem is.  And then Silva, you know, and her boyfriends or her school or her dance or, you know, what  have you, her job.  The swans have you.  Maybe your son's problem, trying to figure out what his problem is.  Maybe you're drunk off your ass, and you give all the attention in the wrong way to  the daughter and her pageant. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, she's not home.  Oh, what an effed up family that is.  Working three jobs, probably giving guys Hummers to pay for, you know, the travel expenses for  these pageants for a little five-year-old.  Yo, man, I will suck you.  You know what should happen?  What?  Should get Matt and Trey on the phone?  Yeah.  They should do a South Park episode.  Oh, the beauty pageant thing?  Wouldn't that be great?  Without a doubt.  Yeah, that would be.  They would just twist it in such a way it would be quite humorous. 
[01:52:30]  Here's another clip.  All right.  Juan, eat sometime.  Clothes are going to be falling off of you.  Don't?  Yeah, they will.  Why?  Because you don't eat enough.  That's why.  You're always going to weigh 26 pounds.  Well, maybe you got it in her head that she's got to look thin and tiny, and you can hear  she's drunk.  She's slurring a word.  Listen to this tape of her, and then grab a tape of me doing a live read Friday. 
[01:53:00]  All right?  And I defy you to tell the difference.  All right.  I guess we could end with the...  No, let's end with...  Oh, all right.  Yeah, because I want to play the Miss America song.  It's a five-year-old woman to end this whole segment.  You look bigger, right?  Right?  What's going to happen when you do that on stage?  You go and look at some other kids?  Tell me.  I want to hear it.  Bye-bye, right?  Judges are here.  Right here.  Look at me. 
[01:53:30]  Now look there.  Now look back at me.  Turn your head.  Turn your head.  You know, if ever I saw a kid that looked a lot, it's you.  Holy ass.  I'm going to punch this lady.  Well, Mom, you know, I'm going to punch you in your seat in a second.  Let's send Stinky to the Fort Myers area to find this bitch.  Jill.  Yeah, I just had a quick observation about the show last night.  Yeah.  If you noticed, Shane and Michael's place where they're doing all the makeup, 
[01:54:00]  a little bit like a mini Playboy Mansion with the girls swimming in the pool  doing makeup in the other room.  That's a great observation.  It's like a Playboy Mansion.  It's a mini Playboy Mansion.  Yeah, that's right.  He had all the little girls in the pool and stuff.  Some were getting their pictures done.  Some were getting makeup done.  You're right.  Some were practicing dance moves in one of the rooms in the house.  Right.  That's it.  I just popped up a page.  It's the Sugar and Spice page for the girls.  There's a 2001 Sugar and Spice calendar. 
[01:54:30]  Calendar girls, Opie.  Look at this.  Look at these girls.  It's the pageant girls.  And on the front of this homepage here, if I go back, I see Mr. Tim.  Huh?  The guy that did the singing.  Oh, the guy that sung the love song to the girls.  We are again honored to open this year's events with the spectacular Mr. Tim as Master of Ceremonies. 
[01:55:00]  What a captivating appearance as he serenaded our beautiful delegates.  Thank you, Mr. Tim.  And look at Miss Ashley.  Miss...  Might as well be Miss May.  This is disgusting.  Miss Minnie May.  Hey, there's a message board.  Want to get the site out?  Yeah, without a doubt.  All right.  It is www.geocities.com. 
[01:55:30]  And you know how much traffic Geocities can handle.  Geocities.com slash Sugar and Spice pageant.  Sugar and Spice pageant.  That's all you got to put in.  Geocities.com slash Sugar and Spice pageant.  And I hope you know how to spell pageant.  It's P-A-G-E-A-N-T.  They know how to spell it.  We're not from the South.  There you go.  Tommy!  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  I said that because I didn't know how to spell it. 
[01:56:00]  I just saw it open.  Okay.  Tommy!  Yeah?  Go ahead, man.  All right.  Look, my sister does this up here in Jersey, man.  Oh, yeah?  I knew that was going to happen.  Tommy!  Tommy!  Yeah.  Yeah, they have one of those down in Jersey, Little Miss America, I think they call it.  Something like that.  All right.  Well...  It's just awful.  If you get a chance, check it out.  Here's five-year-old Swan singing Miss America.  Someday, I'll be a Miss America. 
[01:56:30]  She was a whole lot.  And I'll be proud of you in my heart.  Put on your hands and knees like a dog.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Put the ground on me.  You're a kid-toucher.

We don't keep the same.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Oh, yeah, we've got to get into Robert Blake next.  We have to get into, yeah, Rudy, the mayor.  Rudy.

[02:00:30]  Nice.  We're very happy with the article.  Hope you read it.  We'll talk about it when more people get to read it, because there's a lot of stuff to goof on in the article.  That's for sure.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  All right.  We've got to move on with other things today.  Yeah, I was just laughing during commercials.  The fun and hijinks happening over there at Gracie Mansion. 
[02:01:00]  Ha.  And I bow to you today, because you hit this one on the head.  Yeah.  You said a long time ago that the reason why the mayor is doing what he's doing to this city is because he's not having sex.  He even went on and said that he's impotent.  You said that six to eight months ago.  Well, when they talk about the prostate cancer that he has and the treatment that he chose, yeah, it could leave you sexually impotent.  Limp D, whiskey D, whatever you want to call it. 
[02:01:30]  It's a limp, limp D.  The guy has not had sex in at least a year.  Now, who knows what was going on before that.  Do you think he at least has, like, a dribbler?  Nothing, dude.  Just nothing?  He is sexually impotent.  He has not had any.  You know how crazy that drives a guy?  That's why his beluga whale head flying is so big.  He's backing up with G.  He's having trouble, this guy. 
[02:02:00]  And the treatment he's taken for his prostate cancer?  He can't use Viagra.  No.  Forget Viagra.  Rudy Giuliani can't take the love drug for his impotence because his prostate cancer drug killed his sex drive, experts say.  Hasn't had sex in over a year.  Yep.  That's it.  For the past year, his honor has been impotent because he's been taking Lupron and Casadex, two drugs that eliminate the male sex hormone testosterone, which prostate cancer cells feed. 
[02:02:30]  All right?  So it's blocking his sex drive.  Oh, my God.  You read all the details in the Sunday paper about how he's, like, living in a guest room in the mansion?  Yeah.  Or occasionally he goes over his chick's house.  Like, the ex-wife's got, you know, run of the place with the kids.  She's got run of the house, yeah.  He's in a guest room most of the time.  And then, you know, because of all these treatments, he's staying up all night in pain and stuff.  Yeah.  And his ex-wife knows that. 
[02:03:00]  And I guess right above where he's sleeping is where she works out.  Yeah.  So she'll start working out at, like, 5 in the morning.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, this is an unbelievable story.  It's so many levels.  And, you know, something, the mayor wanted to get a gag order.  He said last week sometime, he said, oh, I can't talk about things because there's a gag order.  Well, there wasn't a gag order.  So then they went to court and signed it.  So then there was a gag order.  Now, Hanover there, Donna Hanover, had it overturned. 
[02:03:30]  So there's no gag order.  So then they come out and say, hey, this guy has been sexually impotent for a year.  Like, now they're starting to throw the mud.  I love it.  I'm kind of rolling the mud.  Tell me the mayor doesn't want to do, like, you know, a Tony Soprano on his ex now.  Strangler.  Ralph Felder, Giuliani's divorce lawyer, said she's like a little kid who killed her parents and then complains that she's an orphan.  She's squealing like a pig.  That's what they're saying about her. 
[02:04:00]  Now, let's see.  What happened there?  Giuliani's sport utility vehicle was outside.  Good friend, Judy Nathan's apartment on 3rd Avenue in Manhattan.  The SUV loaded with luggage, pulled into the building's garage.  So I guess maybe he's staying with her.  Are they going away or something?  Moving in, maybe.  And what's with this Judy Nathan?  She hasn't had any sex with somebody else for a year.  Is that it?  Maybe Rudy chews the rug. 
[02:04:30]  He's got to do something, right?  You've got to keep your chick happy, Opie, right?  So even if he can't do it, let me show you some of the talents I have.  I'm quite a cunning linguist, is what I say.  I'm a crumpet muncher.  Oh, imagine that?  Yeah, I'll start on your neck, and I'll drool on your boobies for a while.  Now I'm just going to...  Yes, yes, it looks like a big volleyball in your lap when you look down on me. 
[02:05:00]  But remember, I can please my chick, and I have no sex drive, so I don't need reciprocation.  Nothing like that.  I'll just...  That's good.  That's good.  How does he even show his head in public?  And he doesn't make testosterone anymore.  So, like, what, he's got to be taken...  Does that mean he's growing man boobs and stuff? 
[02:05:30]  Well, you've got to, what happens, if you don't start, you keep producing the male hormones that keep, they keep your beard growing, they keep, you know, keep you from getting the boobs, they keep your, um...  They keep your, uh, uh, uh, sack from shriveling up to nothing.  And there's Rudy now.  He's going to be a little chick.  I'm a beadoc.  Oh.  So then he goes over her house, and I guess he's got to take care of business, but he doesn't have any sex drive, either. 
[02:06:00]  Could you imagine that?  I think I'd rather die.  It kind of pisses me off, because I would hope the guy would have a sex drive and not be able to do anything with it.  But it looks like he doesn't even have the urge.  So it's like, oh, let me just screw around with New York a little more.  So you mean to say, like, he sees this girl that he, he, he thinks is hot.  Yeah, picture that.  He's driving along with a hot chick on down the street.  And let's say now this girl's naked, it's got to do something to you.  Nothing.  Come on.  Does nothing to him now.  No way.  Nothing. 
[02:06:30]  And think of how much time is spent by a man looking and thinking about sex.  I, I would say 20 hours a day.  So now cancel, yeah.  Cancel all that out.  There's a lot of free time.  Because I know my dreaming's at least four hours of that.  And he's pissed off that other guys get turned on by this.  So that's why he's trying to get rid of strip clubs.  Can we talk to an impotent guy?  Because I want to know.  Something has to happen, even if you're impotent.  If you're looking at a hot girl on the street or a naked girl on the street.  It all depends if you're impotent because the stuff doesn't work like that. 
[02:07:00]  I'm talking, guy, nothing.  Nothing.  Just somebody.  Okay, let's talk to somebody that has no sex drive.  Whether it's medication or whatever.  He doesn't even, see a naked girl, does nothing.  But that's what they're saying, Giuliani.  Our own black girl was stepping in.  Earl, what's that like?  I'm going to go to Kevin.  Kevin, what's going on?  Imagine Giuliani with a strap-on with this chick. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Imagine what that would look like.  See you guys later.  Keep yourself going.  I have a piece of limp linguine here.  But what I'm going to do is get a strap-on.  But I'm going to read while I'm doing it.  I'll hump away, but I'll read because I'm not interested.  I'll give you a reach around with one hand.  Turn the pages with the other.  Oh, God.  I'll just, well, I'll wet my finger and use it to turn the page.  This works out for everything.  Let me just, okay. 
[02:08:00]  Turn the page.  Turn the page.  Turn the page.  Turn the page.  Turn the page.  The medications don't work.  That's right, Giuliani.  They don't.  I can't have sex.  That's why he wanted the voyeur bus taken away.  It did nothing for him.  What does the mayor say when he unzips his pants and looks down his underwear?  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, poor bastard.  I hate this thing.  It doesn't work.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's horrible.  It really is.  But you know something?  The guy's been a prick.  Look, Justice, he's been a prick now.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  Yeah, you taste that, B-A-T. 
[02:09:00]  Hmm.  Let me see.  I'm a bad mother f***er.  Lorde, let me see.  Mm-hmm.  That's right.  I'm Rudy G, I'm here to say.  My hair looks like a roadkill toupee.  I'm the number one man in NYC.  So why are all the homoids so pissed at me?  I'm the R to the U to the D to the Y.  A bad mother f***er makes a food vendor cry. 
[02:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  Get the cars off the streets, you goddamn immigrants.  That's right.  That's right.  I'm a bad mother f***er.  Close the strip clubs and porno stores.  I don't care.  The cops bring my horse.  Take on Al and Farrakhan.  I'm plenty f***ing tough for a skinny white man.  So squeegee guy trying to turn a buck.  Get yourself a job, you lazy f***.  Yeah.  I'm the mayor, man.  I'm number one.  I got a frigid wife and a big fat son. 
[02:10:00]  Don't give me no s*** about Hillary.  That sad-ass bitch ain't no better than me.  I can't file it with the homeless and sick.  All the motherf***ers can suck my s***.  I'm Rudy G.  Yeah, I'm Rudy G, motherf***er.  The listing mayor, Rudy G.  Lord Comeover to the motherf***ers in my head.  Word.  Word.  Let's go to Edward who says he's impotent like the mayor there. 
[02:10:30]  Edward.  Hello.  Edward.  Yes, how are you doing?  Is this real?  This is very, very real.  He's had the same treatment he's had, and it's just no sex drive.  No sex drive?  Whatsoever.  So when you see a hot chick on the street, do you look and go, yeah?  I sure do, but it's just like touching the moon.  You just can't. 
[02:11:00]  You hear where I'm coming from?  But what's the feeling you get?  It's like a sudden, it's like a volcano that's just kept, you know?  But I mean, you see the girl, let's say she's even naked.  You understand she's hot and stuff, right?  Of course.  Does it drive you nuts that you can't do anything?  It drives me over the top.  It just completely drives me.  I have different types of orgasms now.  It's sort of like, you know, penetrate my innermost, the tertiary gland, and just like explode in there. 
[02:11:30]  Tertiary gland.  Dude, what are you talking about?  That's like the growth gland at the base of your brain.  Why would that have anything to do with sex?  Maybe because you'd like to do it again.  I don't know.  Like, that's like has nothing to do with sex.  If you knew anything about medical terminology, you would know that the sex drive begins at the tertiary gland.  Shut up. 
[02:12:00]  You're such a tool, my friend.  Edward.  I'm telling you the facts.  He's so lying.  Go take out an encyclopedia of Britannica.  An encyclopedia of Britannica.  What an idiot.  In the base of the tertiary gland.  We can never get serious on this show.  I know.  We try.  It's kind of frustrating.  I really want to know what the feeling is.  I hate to go back to this quickly, but I'm just checking out the Sugar and Spice message.  Yeah, it's going really fast.  Yeah, well, that show that was on HBO featuring the young beauty contestants like JonBenet Ramsey was in. 
[02:12:30]  Well, there's a website dedicated to this, and we showed our, we told our listeners where the message board was for this, the guest book.  And they've been posting some very, very fun things.  This is the website that has the calendar of all the little girls looking like little hoes.  Yeah, little five-year-old girls dressed like whores.  Okay.  And these people have no problem with this.  I found a jellyfish in the tub this morning.  I can't see how my daddy missed it during his shower. 
[02:13:00]  From Ashley and Mary Kate.  Michael Hunt checking in, but using his short name, Mike.  Mike.  Do you like having your back rub?  You're a kid toucher.  Jay Marco, can I get Mr. Tim's number?  Horny Goat, we're checking in with my balls ache.  That's all he's saying.  Well, I'd like to give the kids rusty trombones.  We're touching kids here on CBS FM.  This is legal, isn't it?  By Rick.  Rick checked in. 
[02:13:30]  Hey.  Wear the crotch shots.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  And how do I get an ant out of my pants?  Very good, people.  You're doing a fine job.  Give out that website again.  Okay.  You can go to www.geocities.com slash sugar and spice pageant.  That's it.  That's it.  Yeah.  Someone's got to print out all these messages before they delete them and put them on soundrymusic.com.  Very funny.  Let's go to Dina. 
[02:14:00]  Dina, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to call and tell you that, you know, the gentleman that called in before  and was telling you about the pituitary gland does have something to do with sex drive.  I'm not sure exactly.  I mean, I don't have the material in front of me, but I remember looking it up recently  for a friend who has a condition.  There is a connection.  In fact, the pituitary gland does control the hormones, certain hormones that are connected  to sex drive.  For instance, prolactin is one of the hormones that the pituitary gland will control the production 
[02:14:30]  of.  Well, I'll tell you what.  That guy, he sure wasn't serious.  Oh, okay.  Well, I just, you know, when you said that, I thought, I just remembered looking at it.  And I'm sure any gland would produce some kind of hormones that have to do with sex,  you know?  It's like a mix and match kind of thing.  You may be right.  But him saying he has orgasms through his pituitary gland is like, get out of here.  I don't know where that came from.  I really don't.  Jack hole. 
[02:15:00]  All right, Dean.  Yeah, possibly.  Cool.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ron.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Listen, I'm a nurse.  I used to co-facilitate for this prostate cancer support group, and I used to have about  20 of these old men with prostate cancer, the funniest guys I'll ever meet.  Oh, yeah?  You used to come in and be like, yeah, the doctor used to take their finger and stick  it up my age.  And, you know, that's when he told me I had prostate cancer, something like that.  Yeah? 
[02:15:30]  All right.  Yeah.  NurseAgent.com.  Oh, there he goes.  He gives out a little website.  Okay.  Probably don't got a path of conversation anyway.  I know.  Frank, what's going on?  Yeah, I had verga's veins on my testicles three years ago.  Plus.  I had testicular cancer a few years ago.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm cringing.  Wait a minute.  Varicose veins on your yambe?  Yeah.  They cut it. 
[02:16:00]  Now, apparently, they cut through it differently.  But what they did at that time, they cut it open and I had my balls were like balls.  I mean, I had to walk sideways, you know, with one leg furrow out, you know.  I hate this claim.  Holy cow.  But the impotents at that time...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Were they removed?  What's that?  Well, you know, you're, you know what? 
[02:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  One was removed.  I thought I told you to shut up.  Yeah, that's freaking out.  So one was removed.  All right.  And are you infinite?  No, no.  That was just temporary.  But, you know, with the sex drive, we're talking about Giuliani.  Uh-huh.  It happens.  I mean, there's no desire.  You have no...  You don't even think about it.  No desire.  No desire.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Okay.  You're welcome.  Bye.  One more on this.  We're going nowhere. 
[02:17:00]  We're trying to get to the bottom.  Pat.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Pat.  Here's the problem, right?  Yes.  This is the real deal.  I didn't have any sexual relations for three years.  And during that time, I gained about 100 pounds just from eating.  I wasn't dating.  I met a girl.  We went to fool around.  Your brain says you're into it.  You feel into it.  And you're fooling around.  Next thing you know, you, you know, you explode down there.  But you never get fully erect.  And that's the problem you have. 
[02:17:30]  You can take Viagra for it and stuff.  For some people, it's weight.  And when you gain too much weight, you don't even know it.  And it's frustrating beyond belief.  Because you can see a hot girl and you can be like, oh, man, what I want to do to her and stuff.  But it's just like, it's just not working, you know?  So you still get all the feelings.  You get the feeling.  In your head, you get like, oh, my God, oh, my God.  And you can actually just explode down there.  And you're like, oh, my God, I exploded.  And I didn't even, you know, get full attention.  I wonder how much of it is.  And you go to the doctor and he tells you it's weight. 
[02:18:00]  You know, you can lose weight to fix that.  But they give you that Viagra, same thing.  The Viagra doesn't, that only makes you explode.  It doesn't make you, you know, full attention.  Right, right, right.  We got it.  So you feel the same way.  You see a girl, you know, I'm in 28, and I'm like, oh, man, what I want to do with her.  And then you're just like, you think everything's working, and they're the ones that tell you it doesn't.  And that's when you're like, oh, man.  You got the whiskey, D.  Oh.  Exactly.  All right, Pat, thank you.  You got it.  Bye.  Jesus. 
[02:18:30]  That's awful.  And the mayor, there he is.  Can't do anything.  So he has the feeling, like the urges, but he doesn't have the ability.  Well, good.  I'm glad.  Poor bastard.  And not only that, then he's got an ex-wife or a future ex-wife that's just ragging his ass all the time.  In the house, won't leave.  It's got to be just a nightmare.  Ah, complete nightmare. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  Let's take a break.  All right.  How many?  Oh, ten pairs.  Nice.  We'll clear the following stink if you're listening, and we'll give out some tickets to an exclusive listening party for the new Radiohead CD.  That's happening at Lux in Levittown, a good club, by the way, on Long Island.  The listening party is this Friday, plus all winners will be entered into a drawing to win tickets to see Radiohead when they come to the tri-state area.  This summer, the new CD by Radiohead will be in stores on June 5th, but you can listen to it this coming Friday. 
[02:19:30]  We've got ten of these.  It's going to be a nice little time.  And we'll give them to ten random callers.  212-757-1027.  Opie Anthony.  I can't make out all the dirty words.  What is this?  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  I love Paisanos.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  I made a, uh, an error.  What'd you do?  I was hanging with Brother Weez this Saturday.  He did his, uh, radio show live from New York. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  We had a good time.  Usually we go to Paisano.  Yeah.  After the, the Weez show.  Uh, it's a no-brainer.  We really didn't want to, like, you know, take the long ride down to Little Italy.  Oh, what did you do?  We went to this joint right around the corner and it blew.  God, did it blow.  Can I change my who's going to get whacked, uh, names for our contest that we have for  the Sopranos that we did earlier?  I got Artie Bucco and, uh, the Russian mob guy.  Yeah.  Uh, I want Opie.  I said I screwed up.  Can I get Opie?  Well, we didn't get off the air until 10 and then cab, it was, we had, like, 12 people. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, boy.  Gotta get three or four cabs or we jump in the, it was just a mess.  So, so someone suggested, why don't we just eat around here?  And it turns out we, we went to one of these new joints that just opened.  The guy was miserable.  God, God.  We show up at 1030.  It was obvious the guy wanted to go home.  There was, like, two couples finishing up dinner.  Yeah.  Treated us like crap.  He's pouring the water on one of the, one of the guy's arms.  Water, you, what?  Just go down to Paisan.  It's right there in the heart of Little Italy. 
[02:21:00]  I said I screwed up.  Well, you take it up with, uh, Joey.  You don't take that up with me.  I'm asking for his forgiveness.  Yeah, well.  I hope for your sake he forgives.  All right.  Opie, I want Italian food tonight.  You know where I'm going?  Paisano, Mulberry Street.  Are you really going tonight?  Yes.  Nice.  Authentic Italian cuisine made from Old World recipes and price right.  Great service, too.  They'll treat you like a king down there.  The portions are huge, so you take some home. 
[02:21:30]  And they got incredible pasta lunch specials.  Ask for Joey, the owner.  Wait, wait.  Let me get this straight.  So if I go there tonight, I will see you eating the fried ravioli?  Absolutely.  I'm right there.  And the veal chop?  Yeah.  I think we're going to have that.  Where will you be sitting?  I don't know.  Probably the usual table.  What about on the sidewalk?  It's, you know, well, it's kind of chilly tonight.  Yeah, I don't know.  We're getting ripped off for spring here.  Who, I don't understand it.  Ask for Joey, the owner.  You get a glass of wine on the house.  Joey better be there.  You know, Joey's got a problem with you now for not going to the restaurant? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, he's got a problem.  No, I got a problem with Joey.  Let me just, I'm putting it right out there right now.  What's your problem with Joey?  I got a beef with Joey.  That he's never there anymore.  The guy, I go down there all the time and I never see him down there.  I got to talk to his cronies.  I want to talk to the boss.  I'm smart.  He doesn't have to be there to run the operation, Anthony.  I know.  They know how to run it, but occasionally you want to sit down with the boss. 
[02:22:30]  And that's Joey.  What, Rick?  You're up top.  I don't know, Rick.  You're Puerto Rican.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.  He's Spanish.  Yeah.  Oh, is that what you're trying this week?  I'm Nordic.  No, just a dick.  Call 965-1188.  965-1188.  Remember that number.  Make reservations.  They're open seven days a week.  Weekends still, too. 
[02:23:00]  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  We're playing with the Deftones this summer.  Late summer.  P.S.C. and Jones Beach.  We have tickets for both those shows to give away.  Not today, though.  Opie?  I want to back you.  Oh, you had some? 
[02:23:30]  Go ahead.  Just quickly.  I have congratulations in order.  For my pal, Adam Ferrara and Dennis Leary.  And?  Huh?  20 o'clock.  20 o'clock, too, of course.  We're on the show now.  The show of The Job.  The mid-season replacement of a few months back.  Remember?  Remember?  You might remember.  Mm-hmm.  Picked up for the schedule.  That's right.  Following that.  Drew Carey at 930 on Wednesday nights.  You will be seeing The Job.  That's so cool. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, look at that.  My pal's in a real show.  Full season and everything.  Yeah.  Nice.  He's on a hit.  Believe me.  Nah, that rocks.  That's really good.  So congratulations to everyone involved in the show.  And, of course, Adam.  My pal.  Yes, there you have him.  Shoot.  I want to back up.  Channel 2 News.  Another killer tease.  What did they do?  If you were listening to the commercials a couple minutes ago, they said,  see what New York restaurants are failing health inspections tonight at 11.  Can we eat and you shut up?  Can we eat? 
[02:24:30]  I don't know how many people are on their way to a restaurant in Manhattan right now.  I know.  And these bastards at Channel 2.  Yeah.  They're not telling us what restaurants we should avoid.  Until 11 o'clock tonight.  Mm-hmm.  So you might go out.  You won't know.  Someone could die from food poisoning tonight because they didn't know.  And they're holding back this info just to get ratings.  Yeah.  On Channel 2 tonight at 11.  So you tune in.  Oh.  And you know something?  You're not doing anyone any favors because a lot of people are in, you know, 
[02:25:00]  in cabs and in cars and on the train with their Walkman on.  And they're not helping.  They're not helping.  They're going to restaurants right now.  Someone could die.  You know what happens, too, with these news reports?  They're going to restaurants, and they look for E. coli and other kind of bacteria that hurt people.  You know, the publicized ones that everyone knows about.  And they scrape the bottom of a chafing dish or something or one of those big tin things that food goes in. 
[02:25:30]  And they go, oh, look what we found, some E. coli.  But you can find E. coli anywhere.  They just try to scare you.  They're doing a good job.  You know what?  I think my brother's away.  He's in the business.  Yeah.  We could do a whole segment on this with my brother,  and we could easily get 10,000 to 20,000 people to never eat in a restaurant again.  Oh, don't do that.  He's told me things that I'm going out tonight.  First off, he goes, never, ever, ever, ever, ever eat the bread.  Ever.  What? 
[02:26:00]  Because, you know, when they bring the bread over?  Yeah.  Whatever's not eating, they just throw back into the bread bin,  and they just pick out the best-looking pieces for the next guy.  No.  Swear to God.  No.  Swear to God.  I want big bread.  Well, I'm folding it.  You could be a real a-hole.  Let's say you go to a restaurant, okay?  Yeah.  You could be a, you could just, you could just pick your nose and put it all over the bread  and make it look like you didn't even touch it?  They will, they will reserve that bread. 
[02:26:30]  Well, anywhere I go, I ask for fresh bread.  Oh, that'll take care of it.  Then they wipe it on their genitals.  That'll take care of it.  And bring it back.  Mm-hmm.  I say I'm with the health department.  I would like fresh bread.  And a bribe.  Why is Chamberlain saying we're being told about this food thing?  No boogers, please.  Chamberlain.  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  The commercial just came on for Channel 2 News.  Yeah.  About what's in your food. 
[02:27:00]  All right.  Now, Anthony somehow had a brain freeze.  Like, he really didn't listen to that commercial at all, did he?  No.  You kind of sequence it a little better, you know?  What?  You can't cut it that thing.  I don't know if you understand what I'm saying.  Chamberlain, explain.  We're giving you a chance.  What I'm saying is, the commercial was just on.  You guys hear the commercials.  But give it ten minutes before you start talking about it.  Like, Anthony's like, oh, what are you talking about?  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  I wasn't listening to the commercials.  And I still don't know what the F you're talking about. 
[02:27:30]  Explain.  I don't know.  It sounded cheesy.  The commercial just came on.  All right.  I don't know.  I'm a troll.  No, no.  I was trying to make way.  No, no.  I got it.  I got it.  Okay.  Why?  I got it.  Why?  Because I brought up the food thing, because, yeah, the commercial just played, and I heard  it in the background.  Yeah.  Okay?  So, I brought it up to you, and you're like, oh, really?  Because you're really hearing it for the first time.  Oh, did he think we're faking it?  Yeah.  No.  Dude, you couldn't be more.  I'm wrong. 
[02:28:00]  I swear I was not paying attention to the commercial.  Oh, come on.  All right.  All right.  I want you off the hook this time, but the next time you do it, you have a question.  What do you think?  It's like one of those things where Opie goes, hey, did you hear that spot?  No, Opie.  Why don't you tell me about it?  Yeah.  We talk about our setups during commercials.  This is how it came about.  I put my headphones on early, and I heard the last, I don't know, 10, 15 seconds of that  commercial.  I said, ooh, let's bring this up on the air.  You obviously did not hear the commercials.  Because I was reading the thing on the job.  Right.  I go, Anthony, can we go back?  Because I just heard something, because it's something we've been doing on the show lately, 
[02:28:30]  these killer teases that the news stations do.  I had no idea I was bringing that up.  What a dick.  What a dick.  See, now all the chefs are calling.  We don't even have to go there, because we're going to just spoil everyone's dinner tonight.  Yes, please.  Don't do that.  All right.  All right.  I guess that's the last we'll hear of Adam Ferrara, down from Hoboken. 
[02:29:00]  I'm hoping he still stays a pal.  The Robert Blake thing, yeah.  Yes.  Yes, Robert Blake.  Boy, this story gets better and better.  You're following this story very closely.  You've been on top of this since the beginning.  Yes, hoping.  I thought it sounded a little suspicious right from the get-go.  New theory.  Yeah.  I said, as soon as the news broke, that it was a hitman, no doubt, hired by Robert Blake.  Yeah.  Now I think Robert Blake did it.  Oh, really? 
[02:29:30]  And I was telling you, someone's going to laugh at me, but that's fine.  That's why we talk out of our A's.  Yeah.  I said that he lined up the shot.  Yeah.  Snuck back out to the car, lined up the shot, and kind of twisted his hand around so no  gunpowder would get on it.  Now you're going to say the gunpowder on his hand.  Okay.  Glove.  But nowhere else.  Wearing a glove and a, you know, you need a big glove.  People that shoot, they get residue, gunpowder residue over their whole body. 
[02:30:00]  Like you could pick it up on their leg.  What if you're shooting around the corner, though?  Your hand's just kind of like this.  It doesn't matter.  If you ever watch the slow motion night shot of a shot being fired, that blast goes everywhere.  It's amazing.  There you go.  It really is.  So it could still get on him.  So I don't know about that, but they have found a gun.  That's right.  Police found the gun, they believe, was used to kill Blake's wife in a trash bin a block  and a half away from the restaurant that the shooting took place.  There was still one bullet in the gun. 
[02:30:30]  Two shots were fired into her head.  And the gun, described as a Walter pistol, described as a collector's item.  And Robert Blake, a gun collector.  They also found a box of the same type of ammunition with three bullets missing out of  the box.  One bullet was found in the gun, two were found in her head.  But ask OJ, that's not enough.  But now they're saying also that the casings of the ammo, which is very popular ammunition, 
[02:31:00]  the casings were a little different than the ones in the gun.  But who knows?  Maybe he, you know, because a lot of people, you get the type of ammo, you get new ammo,  and as you use it, you might combine two boxes.  You know what I mean?  You kind of fill up your other box so you can throw away the box of half-used ammo.  So it doesn't really.  I don't know.  It's looking more and more like Robert Blake may be responsible for this or have something 
[02:31:30]  to do with it.  And a waiter saying that he didn't come in for the gun or another thing.  Or it didn't look like he was coming in for a gun.  The alibi.  Blake's alibi that he went back to the restaurant to retrieve the pistol, contradicted by a bus  boy, who told police, black, I must speak English.  No, he told police, he cleared the table with a couple of eights before the actor returned  and found no gun.  And his whole alibi is, hey, I wasn't there when she got shot because I came in here to 
[02:32:00]  get my gun.  He's a gun collector.  He's had guns for years.  But somehow he dropped it on the floor or put it on the table and forgot it.  So have any of the tests come back to see if there's anything on his clothing or stuff?  Yeah, they said they had no gunpowder residue on his hands.  I don't know about clothing or anything.  They just said his hands.  He was too shaken up to take a lie detector test.  And they went into his house, and where's this part of the story? 
[02:32:30]  Let's see.  They went into the house to search it, to get tapes and files and whatnot.  And they said his house was ransacked, like kind of a mess.  And on the walls were painted something like, they're not going to get me for this, or I'm  not going down for this.  Like he painted stuff on the walls.  He's a little kooky.  Just a little kooky.  A lot kooky.  Sean. 
[02:33:00]  Hey, guys.  Listen, now, the gun I found, the Walter PPK, is the same gun that 007 uses in the movies.  Oh, yeah?  I'm just wondering if Blake was wearing a tuxedo that night.  Maybe he was in character.  Oh.  Was the car in Austin Healy?  Look at you with obscure references.  Very nice.  I'm sorry.  Take care, guys.  You suck.  That's good, Sean.  Blake's a close friend, this guy John Solari.  Solari said that he was very embarrassed when he discovered that this chick was sending 
[02:33:30]  out old nude photos of herself to other men, because she was doing it.  She was doing phone sex, sending old men pictures of her naked so they'd send her money.  This is how she got money.  She built a lot of people.  So this Solari guy offered to kill this woman to Blake.  He said, I'll kill her.  And Robert Blake said, no, no.  I can't.  I can't do this.  I got to make this work.  And he said, no, Robert, I'll take her off the count. 
[02:34:00]  It's like a Verretta episode.  Hey, don't go taking her off the count.  They're not going to pin this on me.  He begged me and said, John, John, don't ever do that.  I got to make this work because of my daughter.  I don't want to grow up and know this happened.  So, I mean, it's been out there already that there were such problems that this Robert Blake guy told his friend  that he was having such problems with this girl that the friend offered to kill her.  So maybe Robert Blake said, hey, let me take matters into my own hands. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, we have a New Jersey PI on the phone, Rich.  Rich?  Hey, guys.  Solari.  I'll be short and sweet.  When you offer too much information, it's out of nerves.  Right.  Something's on his mind.  And he's enveloping too much conversation and too much information to try to make him innocent.  He's as guilty as sin.  Yeah, that's always the worst thing you can do is try to come out against the girl, too. 
[02:35:00]  And that's what they've done.  Like, Blake's lawyers have just been bashing this chick.  Right.  And when you have, you don't put a gun on a table like you put a phone on a table.  If you have a gun, you can feel it.  You put it in, like, a leather holster around your ankle.  Yeah, you don't just plop it on the table.  Yeah.  It's just too much information there that he's revealing.  And plus the fact, I believe his lawyer is filling his guts about his wife because he feels maybe because if it goes to the courts, he won't be able to bash his wife then. 
[02:35:30]  So they're trying to get it all out now to make his wife a bad person.  Yeah, get it out in the press.  Right.  Because if it does go to court, it does go to trial, the judge will never allow him to do that.  Mm-hmm.  So I think that's what the motivation is here.  I mean, how could you possibly trash a woman the day after she's been killed?  Yeah, you know, you're so broken up about it, yet your lawyer comes out and starts bashing, and he has nothing to say about it.  He doesn't turn around and tell his lawyer, what are you, insane?  Stop doing that.  No, because day after day, the lawyer came out and started bashing this woman. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, it is.  I don't know when it's going to come out.  I don't know when they're going to try to find something.  You've got to get this limit, Bull.  I know for sure that the police out there know that he is guilty.  They're just looking for a reason to, they're looking for something to book him on.  Oh, yeah.  They just need that little piece of key evidence, and then it's over, Johnny.  He's going.  Yeah.  All right, Rich.  Foolish.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  It's all completely explainable.  I don't see what the big fuss is all about. 
[02:36:30]  He's a collector of guns.  So he brought one to the restaurant and dropped it.  The busboy threw it away, and that's how it ended up in the dumpster.  I am a knife collector.  I don't see the problem there.  Nicole fell on my knife collection multiple times.  Do you have audio of this lady?  Yeah.  What's the first one?  Look, a cookie woman.  I'm a bull collector.  I love them.  Heart check, kidney, I don't care. 
[02:37:00]  Heated, not heated.  They could drown a wife like, oh, I mean, if I could limit it.  The first one is, I believe, where she's talking about having her fake IDs and how it's her business.  Yeah, she would have fake IDs and steal people's like, okay.  So she can, you know, hook up with men.  She was definitely into, like, some shady stuff.  Yeah, I know.  I've had three years probation just for having different IDs, you know. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  And it wasn't even like I was really used to them for anything totally, you know, too, too illegal either, you know.  I mean, it's my business.  And if I want to, you know, like, full guys in the mail and say that I'm somebody else, you know, what's the difference?  For money?  No, it is a crime.  You can't do that.  What?  It's my business.  I didn't do things too, too illegal.  This is legal, isn't it?  I think that would piss off your husband a little bit, though.  Oh.  Give him a reason to shoot you in the head. 
[02:38:00]  Shoot you in the head.  What's the second clip?  The second clip, I'm not sure, but I know the third clip.  The second one's quick, anyway, so let's take a listen.  Even if I was to admit and say, okay, well, no, I didn't take the pill.  I told him I didn't take the pill, and I didn't take it at that date.  She's having a conversation, obviously, with somebody about tricking an actor into getting her pregnant.  Shut up, rummy.  Oops.  Throw the gun. 
[02:38:30]  Take the cannoli.  And what's the third clip?  And the third clip is of her talking some more.  Oh, I just forgot what it was about.  It'll be obvious.  I was just a kid that everybody hated in school because I was, like, poor and couldn't dress good, you know,  and everybody always made fun of me because I was, like, real loner type, you know.  So then you grow up saying, oh, I'll fix them.  I'll show them.  I'll be a movie star, you know.  And it was too hard because I was always falling for somebody.  So I figured, well, why not fall for a movie star instead of becoming one, you know? 
[02:39:00]  Oh.  I mean, let's face it.  She jumped on Dean Martin's peg.  Yeah.  That's Gary Lee Lewis's peg.  Christian Brando's peg, it looks like.  The world isn't losing a Nobel Prize winner here, believe me.  Dean Martin's limp peg.  Oh.  Oh.  You know, it's not a huge tragedy to the country that this one bought the dust. 
[02:39:30]  She seems like a real flake and a real shyster.  But as far as who did it, I'm kind of leaning towards Robert Blake.  Steve.  So is Steve.  He's got a gunpowder theory.  Ah, Steve.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  They love the show.  Look, I know a lot of guys down in the city that carry what they call a throwaway.  Right.  And what they'll do is they'll stuff it in a plastic bag.  After they use it, I mean, that obviously would take care of some of the gunpowder. 
[02:40:00]  And then they just dump the empty shell and the gun out and get rid of this bag.  There's just a theory for you.  What, they put it in a plastic bag and shoot it that way?  Yeah.  So they don't leave any prints on the gun.  It's not going to leave any residue from, you know, from the blast.  Hmm.  Interesting.  You ain't buying it?  I don't know.  Well, I think he's involved.  I definitely think he knew she was going to die that night.  Right then and there.  Yeah.  I can't wait for the whole story to come out. 
[02:40:30]  Another OJ thing.  We're all going to be watching Court TV.  All right, Steve.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Thanks.  And, you know, it just happened and then the real killer, let's call him, disappears.  Like, it's so, there's no trail.  There's no nothing.  There's no suspects except for Robert Blake.  When it comes down like that, because the Nicole thing, there was no, we're looking for this person.  We're looking for a description of this, that.  No, you were looking for OJ. 
[02:41:00]  There he is.  And then with this, it's the same thing.  They're not saying we're looking for a late model this or we're looking for a guy that fits this description.  There's nobody.  There's Robert Blake.  So, it doesn't look good for Beretta, but I'm sure Nick at night or something is going to bring back the old series so we can all enjoy it.  That's what they always do.  You know, with the OJ trial, all you'd see is him as Nordberg going down the stairs with the big stadium in the wheelchair with the big afro trying to fit through the door, you know.  In between watching him on Court TV, you're like, hey, that's so funny, OJ. 
[02:41:30]  There he goes.  So, you're going to be seeing him with the cockatoo on his shoulder, talking to that old rummy.  The goof-throwing towering Inferno back on the tube.  The old J.  The old J.  Well, Godspeed there, Robert Blake.  Good luck.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary, and you know what?  You will never hear me on the Opie and Anthony show on 102.7 WNEW.  That's a guarantee.  If you hear somebody claiming to be me, it's probably Willem Dafoe, not me.  I wouldn't do the show. 
[02:42:00]  Anthony, New York Sports Clubs.  Yes, Opie.  New York Sports Clubs.  I'm working out at New York Sports Clubs now.  Oh, yeah?  Solved my little problem, and now I've got a membership, and I'm very, very, very, very happy.  Like the equipment?  I love the equipment.  It's nice.  State-of-the-art equipment at New York Sports Clubs.  You've got to wait to get on it?  Ah, no.  No?  Cool?  No.  They've got so much equipment.  Yeah, that's something that's important.  It is.  You don't have to wait as long.  They've got tons of cardio machines.  State-of-the-art cardio machines. 
[02:42:30]  On some, you can check out the Internet while you're working out.  That's good.  See, then time flies by, you don't even realize you're working out.  It's great.  Very, very happy.  The thing about New York Sports Clubs that we can tell people, they're everywhere.  Yeah.  I've got something called, I think it's called a passport.  Passport.  Passport, right, Rick?  I've got that, too.  You've got the passport?  It's awesome.  It really is awesome, because most people, they join their local gym in their town, you  know, but maybe you're away on business, or you're in the city, or this and that.  I can work out, like, at over 70 gyms. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, so it's not like a lot of people try to choose, should I get the gym near my work  or my house?  And then you get it by your house, and it's like, huh, this would have been convenient.  I get off of work.  I could have gone.  But now I'm out of luck.  Yeah, with New York Sports Clubs, I work out near home, and I work out near work.  Nice.  Very nice.  Yes.  I mean, you've seen the New York Sports Clubs for yourself.  You can't walk a block without anyone.  They're all over.  They're taking over, and they're really doing it right, without a doubt.  New York Sports Clubs, they have a better way, a stress-free way.

That's right.  I forgot about that.  They offer all these classes, so, you know, if you want to do something a little different  and join a class to get in shape, that's something you can do as well, okay?  No better time to join than now.  It's New York Sports Clubs.  They're in your neighborhood, so give them a call.  1-800-301-1231. 
[02:44:00]  This year, make your fitness resolution work at New York Sports Clubs.  Ready?  Three, two, one.  I found out why the government is actually behind the glow-in-the-dark monkey.  Why?  Because they think it'll be easier to spot your television leaving you at 5 at 6 o'clock in  the morning.  Hold to your ear back.  Sorry about this, kid.  Stay tuned.  1027-WNEW.  It's time to play What Did We Learn on the ONA Show today?  Educational.  Couldn't talk about the hookers thing, man. 
[02:44:30]  Ran out of time.  Oh, no.  Basically, because of Rudy cleaning up the streets, you don't see many hookers walking  around Midtown.  Street walkers.  Street walkers, sure.  So, they're riding around in cars themselves.  Now, they drive in the car.  It used to be, they would stand in the corner.  You'd drive by.  You go, hey.  They go, hey, baby, you want a date?  And then they'd hop in.  You'd haggle a little overpriced.  Try to feel out if it's a cop.  They get in the car. 
[02:45:00]  You find out they're a transvestite and get embarrassed in front of your friends and family.  Then you've got to go in.  What?  Oh, sorry.  I was listening.  No, and then all of a sudden, that's how it was done.  It happened to Ben once.  That was a hooker, whatever.  That was a hooker for another day.  But now, yeah, they've switched roles.  Now, the hookers are in the cars driving around and just asking the guys.  You need a date?  You want a date?  And then you jump in for a little fun and they'll even take you to your favorite hotel, 
[02:45:30]  whatever you want to do.  It's got to make it a little harder for the cops because the way it was with them walking,  you'd ask them.  If you were a cop or something and the hooker gets in your car, there, now the hooker's in  your car.  If you're a cop and you drive up and the hooker's on the street and she says something, you give  the little thing, you toot your horn, you flash your light, then the cops come and nail  her on the sidewalk.  Now, if you get into that car, she's at the wheel.  You're in the passenger seat. 
[02:46:00]  Even if you're a cop, it kind of puts you in a weird position.  It's a little more dangerous.  And they're driving really nice cars.  Yeah.  They got sunroofs and stuff so you can look right in and check out her body.  Pimp Daddy's been fastened up.  So, we should try to get one of these hookers on the line.  Oh, yeah.  They'll talk.  Oh, yeah?  I think we could get one that'll talk.  Where are the hookers cruising these days?  Right outside our building.  Right in Midtown.  What was it?  The Daily News or The Post.  They did a whole story on it today and it turned out it was the Sheridan a couple blocks down  on South.  Oh, my God. 
[02:46:30]  Really?  And they talked to the one girl picked up, I think it was the reporter doing the story.  That's always cute.  That guy, that's just an alibi.  No, seriously.  I was writing a story for the Daily News.  Yeah, you really didn't even have a story to write.  Oh, my God.  I was doing something on housekeeping and hotels.  Right.  Oh, no.  No, honey.  I swear I'm doing a story on hookers.  The guy probably got caught picking up one of these girls and said, oh, my God, thank  God I'm a writer for the Daily News.  I'll just make believe I've been, you know, following this story for months.  I'm going to do this story. 
[02:47:00]  Right.  Douglas Montero, you're not fooling anyone.  I'm going to shelve the story on the bacteria in hotel beds.  Right.  Probably got arrested.  Horror in the hotel rooms.  Damn, I got to put that off.  He got arrested.  Told the cops, come on, man, you're blowing my cover.  I've been working on this story.  It's coming out tomorrow.  He just writes an article really fast.  I'm looking at it together.  For the love of God, please print this so I don't get screwed.  Let's see.  You have the hookers.  How about the guy in the story that came out of the bar hammered and he thought the 
[02:47:30]  chick was just talking to him because he was a good-looking guy or whatever?  Yeah.  You know what they do?  They said they line up outside of strip clubs.  You know what strip club they're talking about?  Oh, yeah, we know that one.  Oh, come on.  The only one left in time, Scrant.  Probably like Flash Dancers.  Of course.  Right on 7th Ave.  They're all just lined up.  The guys, the bars closed.  They're hammered.  They got the hotels ready because it's Midtown.  They're all over the place.  And there you go. 
[02:48:00]  Samantha 20 said, the cops tell us don't walk the streets.  Get in your car and go.  That's what they're doing.  The cops don't really bother you as much in the car.  To the naked eye, Samantha looked like a spoiled rich kid looking for trouble in Dad's car  when she pulled up alongside me at 4 a.m. near the Sheridan.  This is Douglas, the writer.  He's doing his research at 4 in the morning.  Her fresh smile can make an ugly fat man feel cute.  You want to hang out, Samantha said, as the light changed and the car behind her began honking. 
[02:48:30]  She told me to cross 7th Avenue where she pulled her 2000 Mustang convertible over on 53rd.  Sexy yet firm.  Sexy yet firm.  Sexy yet firm.  That doesn't make sense.  Samantha was strictly business.  Running the tips of her fingernails up her thigh while telling me it will cost $200 for her body.  Hail hookers like Samantha usually target Midtown tourists.  Already have hotel rooms.  She offered a $60 night 10th Avenue hotel. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, my God.  She was willing to drive me there or follow behind my car or a cab, whatever location I felt relaxed at.  They're hail hookers, they're calling them.  Hooker!  Yeah.  Jesus.  Check this out.  The desperate men are easy to spot.  Greg, a 40-year-old school teacher, remembers stumbling out of a Midtown bar at 3 a.m. recently  when a gorgeous woman in a fancy sports car pulled alongside of him at $56,000 and $7,000. 
[02:49:30]  She's hookers are all around us.  They're right outside our building in these cars.  She smiled.  He smiled back.  She handed Greg a business card with the words Dream Travel printed in bold letters.  If you want to play, give me a call, the woman said as she drove off.  Greg thought he picked up a travel agent until he examined the card closely.  A travel agent!  And he read the card for the trip of your dreams and realized the woman was a hooker.  It's better, Greg said.  You don't feel like it's going to be sleazy. 
[02:50:00]  You know, like you're picking up a whore in the street.  It's a woman in a sports car.  You feel this is going to be better.  Another story that a guy gave his wife.  What's this card?  I thought it was a travel agent.  I thought it was a travel.  Dream travel.  We're going to Bermuda.  Me and you.  Huh.  I was going to book a cruise.  And she started sucking.  Sucking and effing.  So now I blew on travel money.  What does the light on top of the car say when she's done? 
[02:50:30]  Off booty?  Oh, God.  Dan from Hoboken.  This is a call back from the first break of the show.  I learned the girl that recognized Stinky on the street today was a hooker.  Hi, this is Joe Tori.  Remember, unzip your fly and get ready for the best BJ of your life.  Remember, always wearing a seatbelt. 
[02:51:00]  Hi, if you enjoyed your ride, remember, pay up now.  And odds.  We got your skipper.  Greg, what's going on?  Hi, this is Joe Ribbons.  Remember, don't get any junk all over your pant leg when you go home.  Just a helpful answer.  All right.  Remember, wipe up all the Kleenex and we'll see you at the stadium. 
[02:51:30]  Hi, this is Rudy Giuliani.  I can't get some, but that doesn't mean you can't.  Hell, okay.  Oh, geez.  They have his blue card on the front.  What do you think?  Not for robbery.  You've got to protect the driver's head.  Oh, man.  Hey, Greg, what's up?  Greg.  Yeah.  It's you.  You're lying.  Okay.  Well, that ain't my real name, but I have met a couple of these ladies here. 
[02:52:00]  One was driving around like a Lexus SUV, man.  It was great.  Yeah, they're driving like really new, nice vehicles.  I don't know if it's dead.  It's probably the PEMP or something.  No, it's the PEMP.  That's what I said.  I mean, yeah.  That makes you feel better about it.  If you drove up in a, you know, a skank car.  That's true.  You know, but if they got the nice SUV or, you know, a real fancy car or convertible.  Yeah, nice and relaxing.  There you have it.  All right.  All right, Greg.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Bye.  That is something else. 
[02:52:30]  And remember to get your receipt when you leave the vehicle.  Don't slip on your own sploot.  Enzlo from DeBronche.  Today, I learned that Rana Fez's motto is keep them guessing.  I also learned that Rudy G is a crumpet muncher.  I learned that Nicole died from falling on O.J.'s knife collection multiple times.  And I also learned that Mr. Tim is running a kid-touching empire.  There we go.  I learned Earl knows how Rudy G feels.  Anthony from West Orange.  I learned that 007 killed Robert Blake's wife. 
[02:53:00]  We don't really have time to play this.  No.  That's okay.  No.  We had a good time today.  Today, I learned that Opie's neighbor has a crime scene mattress.  This is pretty funny.  Some guy from Brooklyn.  Oh, Giservoir.  Okay.  Good name.  Today, I learned Opie saw Norton's hog.  I guess they're friends now.  Tonight on Fox.  Whores behind the wheel.  Can't wait to see that story. 
[02:53:30]  What the hell are they waiting for?  I'd watch that news story.  Tease that one.  Hookers in Lexus.  In Midtown.  Where can you find them?  Join us.  We'll tell you the lesson.  Where you can pick up our hooker.  Firm yet sexy.  Give me that story.  We got to call this writer from the Daily News.  Yeah.  I want some more info.  We got to get him.  It's the post.  I'm sorry.  The post.  Getting in a car can get you laid.  Tune in. 
[02:54:00]  Fox 5 to 10-11.  Find out where the hot spots are to get your junk.  Cool freak.  Puddle from New York.  Yeah.  Today, I learned there's an ugly fat writer for the Post doing research at 4 a.m.  4 a.m.  Unbelievable.  That sounds like such an excuse.  I was leaving the Sheridan at 4 in the morning when all of a sudden.  I just got a great idea. 
[02:54:30]  I got to get a job for the Post.  You could never get in trouble.  Built-in alibi.  Whatever you're doing is a story.  You could never get in trouble with your wife or girlfriend because you'd get caught doing anything.  No, honey.  I'm writing a story.  I couldn't tell you about it because I'm undercover.  It's a story.  All right.  Before we go, once again, I want to congratulate Kelly, the whipped cream bikini champion.  Yeah.  She's got the trip to Hawaii courtesy of Contiki Tours.  You're not going to play the song for her?  Yeah, we could.  Celia comes in second place.  She's got a long weekend at Laurel Bay Inn in Ocean City, New Jersey. 
[02:55:00]  Nice.  And third place went to Jessie.  She's got a gift certificate to spend on whippedcreambikini.com, Anthony.  Lovely.  We'll send this out to Kelly as we leave you on this fine Monday.  Hey, guys, thanks for listening today.  Yes.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:55:30]  You ever seen a grown man naked? 
[02:56:00]  You use your tongue dirtier than a $20 hole.  We've got voice. We've got voice.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  You've got some funky pictures. 
[02:56:30]  Who's that?  What the hell is going on?  The O'Neil and Anthony is going.  Who knows the name?  Who knows the name?  Who knows the name?  Who knows the name?  Who knows the name?  Who knows the name?  Who knows the name?  Who knows the name?  Who knows the names?  Who knows the name?  Who knew the name? 
[02:57:00]  Who knew the name?  Oh yeah.  What's in here?  Hey...  Fuck yourself.  Fucked you soon.  Oh man, this is so hard for fish.  Fuck you.  Thank you very much.  I got you.  Hey, shut up.  You better eat it.  Here you go.  And you're in here.  That's a winner.  That's a good business.  What?  Hopi and Anthony.
