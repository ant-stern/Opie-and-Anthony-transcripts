<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts and an unidentified co-host.  They extensively discussed the reality show "Joe Schmo," praising its authenticity and reminiscing about its first season, mentioning cast members Kristen Wiig and Ralph Garman.  They also recapped Bubba Ray Dudley's previous day's appearance, focusing on his stories about Brooke Hogan.  Numerous listener calls inquired about E-Rock's whereabouts during his mysterious vacation, eventually revealed to be Italy.  Other pre-show topics included the Bryan Singer sexual abuse allegations, the Redskins name controversy (and MSNBC's handling of it), a story about a gender non-conforming teen and the DMV, the upcoming "Best Of" show, Dick Cheney's Iraq comments, and significant technical difficulties with the show's microphones, resulting in frustrated interactions with the engineering staff.  A difficult encounter with a new security guard was also recounted, and Tom Papa was announced as a guest.

E-Rock then detailed his Italian trip, recounting a negative experience with United Airlines, including lost luggage and being downgraded from first class. He described his visit to the Colosseum and catacombs, his observations about Roman architecture and atmosphere, and several unusual encounters, including one with a recognizing listener.  He shared details about Italian food, highlighting differences in preparation and the quality of seafood, and his experience at an Italian McDonald's.  He also mentioned European credit card microchips, peculiar hotel features, and the prevalence of Louie C.K. reruns.  The hosts frequently interjected with humorous and offensive comments.  The segment transitioned to a discussion of vinyl records, prompted by Jack White's new album, Lazaretto, and included tangents about collecting and a call from Sal.  Several well-known comedians were mentioned in voicemails.

The discussion of vinyl continued, with the hosts and a caller debating its merits against digital music. Jack White's Lazaretto's unique features were highlighted, along with anecdotes about various music formats, including VHS, CDs, and 8-tracks, often using vulgar language.  The conversation included tangents on collecting (baseball cards were specifically mentioned), Scott Shannon's vinyl collection, and a caller's complaint about a flawed record.  Numerous commercial breaks aired during this segment, including ads for Squatty Potty, Barracuda email security, Rosetta Stone, Instaflex, Dave Smith car dealership, and Sirius XM.  Tom Papa's presence in the studio was mentioned.

The show then shifted to bizarre food items ("red asphalt"), followed by childhood memories of car rides in crowded Volkswagen buses.  The Washington Redskins trademark cancellation was discussed at length, with the hosts expressing disapproval of government involvement and using offensive language. A caller provided legal information, and the conversation touched on potential logo use, reactions from sports networks, and future name changes.  The World Cup was also discussed, along with a racist cartoon from the 1940s.  MSNBC's cautious approach to the Redskins controversy was criticized, and the use of offensive language and political correctness debated.  A Navajo caller offered a differing perspective on the Redskins name. The segment concluded with promotion of an upcoming live show and an Xbox One giveaway.

Following commercial breaks for Quicklane, Rosetta Stone, and LegalZoom, Dr. Steve offered a medical minute about testosterone therapy and cardiovascular risk.  Tom Papa joined the show, discussing his move to Los Angeles, his wife's difficulties adjusting, and his children's easier adaptation.  He expressed concerns about his wife's unhappiness and the challenges of maintaining a New York home while working in L.A., touching on the difficulties of making friends as an adult. He mentioned an upcoming role in a Steven Soderbergh film.  The hosts discussed Japan's child pornography ban, with its anime/manga exemption, comparing it to the US legal landscape.  A discussion about a gynecologist charged with sexual abuse followed, focusing on the hypothetical "perv switch."  Listener calls included stories about a fungus-covered condom and a massage therapist's unusual claim.  The gender non-conforming teen's DMV experience was revisited. The segment concluded with discussions on parenting, making adult friends, and adjusting to a new city; a Cowardly Lion impression was also included.

The transgender individual, Chase, denied a driver's license photo due to makeup, was discussed, with varied opinions expressed and Michael Silverman of TLDEF mentioned.  A 911 call about a fight at a tanning salon, heavily implied to be staged for publicity, was played.  Tom Papa discussed his career and wife's disapproval of his LA work.  Jimmy ("Pinocchio guy" and "Christmas light guy") called in with critiques.  Further discussion of the tanning salon incident, celebrity gossip (Melanie Griffith's tattoo, Malia Obama's work, Aaliyah's biopic), and hosts'/guests' plans followed.  The post-show featured Sam Roberts and listener calls.  Numerous advertisements aired throughout.  Finally, the show ended with additional commercial breaks for Community Tax, Grasshopper, and Zoom e-cigs.

Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts. 
[00:01:00]  With Sam Roberts.  Welcome, indeed.  The big Thursday O.P. and Anthony pre-show.  I am Sam Roberts.  And you need to go ahead and introduce yourself to me, because as of yet, I don't know what your name is.  It's 866-WOW-1-WOW if you want to do that.  866-969-1969.  As always is the phone number to call into the live O.P. and Anthony pre-show. 
[00:01:30]  Coming straight from the little mini side studio, right off the O.P. and Anthony studio.  Peering in through the glass as we prepare for another day of legendary radio greatness of historical proportions.  A lot to get into about what's going to go on on today's show.  A lot to get into about what happened on yesterday's show.  If you have anything to say about any of it, feel free to call in right away. 
[00:02:00]  As always, the first thing that we do on the pre-show is learn from our history.  Because if we don't learn from our history, we're doomed to repeat it.  Not to say repeating yesterday's show would be a bad thing, but it only gets better from here.  Yesterday's show, one of the reasons for me it was so good, was because the Joe Schmo show came up.  Now, O.P. brings this up every now and then.  And whenever he does, it's a treat.  He stands by the fact that the Joe Schmo show is the best reality show that was ever made. 
[00:02:30]  The first season of it.  And I couldn't agree with him more.  We randomly got into it yesterday on the show.  The best one ever was the fake one, though.  The Joe Schmo show?  The Joe Schmo.  That was the best, yeah.  The original Joe Schmo show.  It's one of the greatest things ever on TV.  Yes, I said that.  It is.  100%.  The first season, there's nothing better.  That's fucking fantastic.  Yeah.  The guy is so...  You watched every episode? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  The first season.  The reveal when he finds out everyone was in a...  What the...  He said this.  He goes, what is going on here?  Can we play that again?  Matt Kennedy Gould.  Wow, you're good.  I have it on DVD.  I've watched the season over and over.  They fucked themselves.  What you have to do with the Joe Schmo show, you've got to film like five seasons without  releasing any of them.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because then everyone was in on it and they tried to do a second season and... 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  I think the girl...  Was this a real reveal, though?  Yeah, it was...  This was legit, legit.  There's no way they could fucking fake this.  This is where Kristen Wiig got her start.  Was Natasha in that too, Joe?  No, she was in season two.  She was in that one?  Yeah, she was season two.  That was a bust.  Kristen Wiig was Dr. Pat.  That's right, Dr. Pat.  With the puppets.  Right.  I've seen it so many times.  That's great.  Because they casted all the reality stars that you expect.  A guy that might be gay. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  The cool guy.  The puck.  The puck.  Who was the hutch.  The hutch, right.  The hutch.  He was just puck, but he was called the hutch.  Oh, God.  Does this show still hold up?  I haven't seen it in about 100% at least 10 years.  I probably watch the full season at least once a year.  And then the ceremony where you're getting kicked off.  You had to smash your plate in the fireplace.  And it was Ralph Garman, who's on Kevin Smith's podcast deal now. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  Really?  He was in there too.  Oh, yeah, he was.  He was the host.  Yeah, Ralph did a good job.  It was all about this one guy?  Yeah, it was like...  Everyone was in on it.  He was the only one that wasn't...  I think he was from...  I think he was from Cleveland or something like that.  Perfect dark.  They picked the perfect...  I think he was from Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh.  That's the city.  Yep.  All right.  Yeah.  He's from Pittsburgh.  I would love to talk to this guy.  Matt Kennedy Gould?  Yes.  Because he'd never do anything after this, right?  No.  Nothing.  He didn't want to be a TV star.  He just wanted to make some money to help his family. 
[00:05:00]  And he made, like, real relationships in the house.  Like, who was...  He made...  Who was the guy?  The dumpy guy.  Yeah, all his friendships that he made were all fake and nothing.  One of the writers, they brought him on to be, like, a cast member.  Uh-huh.  Because he was supposed to be the best friend.  And they really created a relationship.  And then he was like, yeah, no, I'm actually...  Not only is this fake, but I wrote it.  I wrote this.  And I'm never going to hang out with you.  Our friendship is completely fake. 
[00:05:30]  This was a job for me.  It just turned into an infomercial for Joe Schmo.  But, I mean, the fact that the show was on in 2003 means that you can...  It's just out of a place of love.  If anybody hasn't seen that show, I would recommend it.  Let's start going to the calls already.  Jason in Detroit.  The question on everybody's mind.  Yes, Sam.  The question on everybody's mind.  We all need to know, is the consumer, E-Rock, back in the building?  Everybody wants to know, is E-Rock, back?  Andrew in Jersey. 
[00:06:00]  Same thing.  Is E-Rock there?  Does he have a can as if he went to Florida?  Or is he wearing one of those shirts like he's a gondola driver?  The questions remain.  Is E-Rock back?  Does he have souvenirs?  Where was he this whole time?  Questions that will all be answered as the pre-show rolls on.  Before we get to that, Bubba Ray Dudley was in studio yesterday.  Bully Ray now from TNA.  But it was cool to have Bubba back on the ONA show. 
[00:06:30]  Because he used to be kind of a regular guest when ONA were on WNEW.  This was like 10 years ago.  And he was in the WWE.  He has not been on the show since Opie and Anthony came to Satellite Radio in general.  Not Sirius XM, but XM.  He just never made his way back into the studio.  He finally came back yesterday.  Great appearance.  And it started with our intern, Carrie Ann. 
[00:07:00]  Still a little sweaty yesterday, I guess.  What happened to tag team wrestling, though?  Why wasn't it as good anymore?  But you just didn't have the quality of the teams of the Dudleys and the Hardys and Edge and Christian and things like that.  How are you doing?  I like to play connected dots.  She sweats a lot.  Yeah.  She's sweating.  She's got a little sundress on.  She was the one that was sweating a lot.  She does construction on her.  She's very adorable, though. 
[00:07:30]  You're adorable.  You're cute.  Oh, dare I say hot.  Whoa.  Lovely girl, but sweats a lot.  Anyway.  The only thing worse than having Bubba Ray Dudley catcall you like he's on a construction site  is having it followed up with Opie saying, oh, she's the one who sweats a lot.  I don't know how this girl survives.  But Bully Ray, he gave us a couple scoops yesterday.  First of all, last time he was in this building, I interviewed him,  and he was talking about storyline marrying Brooke Hogan. 
[00:08:00]  It was something that was going on on television.  It was a wrestling storyline.  Apparently, there was some reality into that story because he went on and he was talking  about Hulk Hogan's daughter Brooke just yesterday and their real-life love life.  Well, no.  There was a little time there where me and his lovely daughter were recording.  An item.  Yes.  Holy fuck-a-rony.  Yeah.  I almost made it to the house.  Did you get it in?  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:08:30]  What?  That's how the kids say it.  That's what she said.  I just say that.  I just say that like a whole.  Oh, but that's how the kids...  Just to make it sound like I want to know, too.  I want to talk like the kids.  She's really sexy, man.  She's fantastic.  Brooke is beautiful.  Beautiful.  I mean, that's a legit six-footer and her bare feet and she's put together like a brick  shithouse.  The problem is she's beautiful for guys like you because you're a big, huge, fucking, in-shape  guy.  For guys like us, she looks like a monster.  For you guys, it's like a rollercoaster.  I think she looks like a monster with a pretty face.  I love her.  She's totally proportionate. 
[00:09:00]  I want to have sex with a giant.  I want to have sex with a giant.  Does she have nice feet?  Yeah, she does.  I've recently kind of gotten into feet.  I'm like, she's a big girl.  She probably has nice, big, sexy, well-shaped feet.  I like those big ones that look like talons.  She took great care of herself.  Beautiful girl.  Had a lot of fun.  How long did you do that?  Damn you.  Wow.  About two months.  Oh, okay.  That's all it takes.  I decided to go back, get back together with my ex-girlfriend, who's now my ex-girlfriend  again. 
[00:09:30]  You blew the Hogan fortune on that?  Yes, I did.  Jimmy, you've got 10 seconds.  Let me have it.  How long did you last?  Let me have it.  Call me every name in the book.  Let's go to Stefan in Texas.  Sam, what's up, brother?  How are you doing, buddy?  Welcome to the pre-show.  Good, good, man.  Hey, I thought Bubba Ray was excellent yesterday, man.  He fit right in and was hilarious.  It actually got me looking back at some of my old wrestling stuff and kind of getting 
[00:10:00]  back into it.  And I was just wondering, when the wrestlers come in and the guys kind of, you know, treat  them as one of their own and respect them, that's got to kind of make you feel pretty  good, you know?  I know.  It makes me feel good in the sense that it's good to see wrestlers get respected, but it  also makes me feel like, what the fuck?  Do I have to get, like, giant arms before I can talk about wrestling and get respected?  Yes. 
[00:10:30]  Is that what it is, right, Weston?  They know that Mars just immediately goes, yes, of course, that's what it is.  They know they can kick the shit out of you, so why would they respect anything you have  to say?  There was questions when Bubba Ray came in yesterday.  Every time Bubba interacts with the Opie and Anthony show, he brings up the old Opie limo  story.  Did the story come up on the air yesterday?  Of course it did.  Here it is.  The story is simple.  You came in to AEW and I was ready to get on the train. 
[00:11:00]  You're like, dude, I'll drive you.  I got the limo.  Why did you have a limo that day?  Because we were doing a media tour and your show was part of it and they picked me up in  Long Island.  Nice.  Yeah.  WWE, you know, back in the days, you know, limousine, riding, jet flying.  Money to be spent.  Yes.  And I was loving it, but I was sitting on the side, which is the worst place to be in  a limo.  You're a little sick in the limo.  And we were having a good time.  I was really digging, talking to you and stuff.  And then I'm like, oh man, I might fucking puke.  This is going to be the worst. 
[00:11:30]  It's the worst.  And then soon as we pulled over on the service road, I was fucking puking.  And there's Bubba just fucking pointing and laughing.  Oh, you actually got out and puking and got back in?  No, I was done.  I made it to my stop.  But as soon as I got out, I had someone picking me up at that exit.  You could have fucking like...  Because why drive me all the way home?  Right, Bubba?  Yeah.  You're the one who said you could drop me off right here on the service road.  Yeah.  On the service road.  Yeah, we'll slug the car down.  Yeah.  I actually made a rule.  And you weren't that big of a star then, so the service road is fine.  I had to make calls like, meet me on the service road. 
[00:12:00]  I think it was Deer Park Avenue, if I remember correctly.  Yeah, yeah.  As soon as I got out, I'm fucking just hurling.  And he's just laughing, pointing and laughing.  It takes off in mid-puke.  You almost made it without him seeing?  Yeah.  No, I saw every bit of it hurt, every bit of it.  I was hurt.  Wow.  Every chunk that came out of his guts was on the side of the L.A.  Damn.  I was hurt.  Oh, poor Opie.  Poor Opie.  Jay in Tampa.  Sammy.  What's up, buddy? 
[00:12:30]  Hey, buddy.  Good.  Hey, I need my E-Rock update.  Did he make it back to the States?  The question remains, is E-Rock in the building?  Is he back in the States?  Did he ever leave the States?  Was he in Florida?  Was he in Italy?  Evidence points in one direction.  But we will find out later today if E-Rock is back from his mystery vacation.  Ross in Toronto, you're on the pre-show.  Hey, Sammy.  How's it going?  Good, buddy.  I was going to suggest the Bryan Singer story to bring to the show today. 
[00:13:00]  What's that?  Have you heard about it at all?  What happened?  He's the recent director of the new X-Men movie.  And his boyfriend came out sort of like the NBA situation.  His boyfriend came out saying that, like, he's been sexually exploitive.  And he's got pictures of him doing gay stuff.  Yeah, but isn't that story from, like, a month ago?  Yeah, but it's a lot like the Donald Sterling situation.  And I wasn't sure if you guys covered it at all.  I think there's been some recent news on it.  Yeah, thanks, Ross.  I think we talked about it a little bit. 
[00:13:30]  But it was one of those things, I mean, it's kind of done.  People aren't really talking about it anymore.  Unlike the Donald Sterling thing, which just lasted forever and ever and ever.  Or, uh, the guys aren't into wrestling anymore.  They were, during, you know, wrestling's heyday in the late 90s, Opie and Anthony were all in.  But they don't watch wrestling anymore.  Aside from, like, me and E-Rock, who does, right?  The way that you can tell that these wrestlers are going to work in studio is when they can talk about other things. 
[00:14:00]  You can just sit down and shoot the shit with them.  As it turns out, who knew, Bubba Ray Dudley, Bully Ray, is a massive soccer fan.  So who better than Bully Ray to try to explain the World Cup to Opie and Anthony,  two gentlemen that have been trying to figure out this soccer thing, for several days now.  Let's go to the track.  I've got to ask you guys one question.  Yes.  What's with all the hatred for the World Cup?  It's not hatred.  It's misunderstanding.  It's indifference. 
[00:14:30]  Indifference.  That's a good word.  Well, explain it.  I love it.  It's my favorite sport.  Wow.  Soccer is your favorite.  I love soccer.  It's my favorite sport.  Why?  Because of the passion of the game.  There is no more passionate sport, and there's no more passionate fans than soccer fans.  Now, soccer fans in the United States are good, but when you see soccer like in Europe,  like the English Premier League or the Italian League, you're talking about a different level.  Stuff over there makes Yankees' Red Sox look like sandbox play.  Right.  That's how into it the people are.  So I just love the passion of the game. 
[00:15:00]  Well, that used to be wars.  Back in the day.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Just go and conquer each other.  That's right.  That's why they have that, because they remember, hey, you killed my grandfather.  It's true.  Like, the two teams over there, Celtic and Rangers.  Basically, it's the Protestants versus the Catholics.  Oh, wow.  And when they get together, it's a whooping good time.  Some hooligans in the crowd, too, huh?  Yes.  They mean business.  Yes.  I don't know.  We were talking about it.  Like, when you get three shots on goal the whole game, you're kind of like, ah. 
[00:15:30]  It's a lot of guys running.  Do you actually watch entire matches?  The entire game.  It's only an hour and a half game.  No, I know that.  It's a short game.  I know it feels like an eternity sometimes with the lattice scoring.  But yesterday, Brazil and Mexico, that's the most exciting 0-0 game you'll see.  Wow, really?  But do you feel a little empty?  No.  Although Mexico, like, that's a big deal for Mexico, obviously.  Watching a game like that is kind of like having tantric sex.  You don't necessarily have to come to get off.  Jimmy, cue the one-liner. 
[00:16:00]  And you don't have to pretend you like Sting's music.  Okay?  I would change the phrasing of that, because still, when I hear it's the most exciting  0-0 game that you'll ever see, that's like saying this is the most delicious pile of shit  that you'll ever eat.  It's like, what's still a pile of shit, isn't it?  Isn't it?  Uh, Psycho Bob in Baltimore, welcome to the pre-show.  Good morning, Sam.  I was wondering if we're going to have a Sam show tomorrow. 
[00:16:30]  Dude, there's no need to wonder that.  Every Friday, there's a Sam Roberts Friday show.  That's why it's called Sam Roberts Friday show.  It's on every Friday.  And what about getting it on in the morning?  Well, right now we do afternoons, 3 p.m.  Look, I have no desire to wake up early if I don't have to.  I don't mind doing afternoons whatsoever.  Sam, if you did the morning, you could do your own pre-show and your own post-show.  Actually, I'm working on seeing if I can bring Denny Falcone on board to possibly host a pre-show 
[00:17:00]  and a post-show for Sam Roberts Friday show.  If you haven't checked it out, it's tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m. Eastern, live here on this  channel, the Opie and Anthony channel.  So, a lot is going to happen this morning on the Opie and Anthony show.  Everybody's got questions.  Will he be in studio?  I will tell you this.  Today, in the Opie and Anthony studio, Tom Papa.  Tom Papa will be here.  Great comedian.  It's been a while since he's been on.  And he's a friend of Rob Zombie. 
[00:17:30]  So, all things considered, I don't see how this could get any better.  Tom Papa will be here in just a little bit.  And there's a clip.  Wait till you hear this.  There's a story.  The Redskins name is being contested in court.  They're going to take away the trademark on it.  The courts are going to take the trademark away because it's offensive or whatever.  However, MSNBC decides to run a news story about this. 
[00:18:00]  We've got audio.  The news anchor won't mention the team name.  She will not say Redskins because it's offensive.  I can't wait to hear what Opie, Anthony, and Jim have to say about this.  We got into a very controversial story yesterday about a young man who does not, considers himself  a gender non-conforming teen.  Is that right, Sal?  A gender non-conforming teen. 
[00:18:30]  He doesn't mind male pronouns.  He was born male, but he likes to wear makeup.  He likes to wear effeminate clothing.  He likes to express himself the way he feels is necessary.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  However, the DMV was not too happy because they did not want him wearing makeup in his  driver's license photo, even though he wears makeup every day of his life.  We got into that story and started listening to the news clip and kind of understanding 
[00:19:00]  what a gender non-conforming teen really means.  Let's go to track five.  He's gay, right?  He's a gender non-conformist.  We've already been over this.  That is, uh...  That's gay.  That's gay.  Right?  He's got the gay voice. 
[00:19:30]  The gay voice.  And the gay face.  He's got the gay voice.  The gay voice.  Nine out of ten times when you hear that voice, the person's...  I mean, right?  Exactly.  But not every gay guy sounds like that.  That's very true.  He's pulling it off.  You know.  I've seen worse.  Oh, yeah.  I've paid worse.  He's quite a delight, Chase. 
[00:20:00]  Chase.  Yes.  All right.  Yeah.  This cautious young driver aced the test with a perfect score.  The photo is what caused a roadblock at the Anderson DMV.  Roadblock.  Roadblock.  Got it.  He said that I could not wear a disguise to take my photo.  He's cute.  And according to her, like, me wearing makeup would be a disguise.  Tell Chase I said what's up.  And that I did not like a boy should.  Chase shared these before and after photos.  To him, this was not about deception. 
[00:20:30]  That should not have to not wear makeup.  It's a fucking chick.  That's very close.  That's a chick.  And the makeup, you're right.  That makeup is not caked on or crazy.  No.  The before and after.  So close.  It's not that different.  It's not different at all.  Yeah.  You should be able to do that.  Who's at the DMV's?  They're dicks.  They're dicks, yeah.  It's probably.  You know what it is?  It wasn't like you had clown makeup on.  Right.  Guaranteed.  Really.  It was probably some ugly chick at DMV that was pissed off that this dude was prettier  than her.  Way prettier.  Or some guy fighting the tent in the front of his pants. 
[00:21:00]  Yes, maybe that's.  Not unlike some people in this room.  Take that makeup off.  You fucking slut.  You gotta look like a boy.  Yes.  I can't handle this.  I love that Ant started developing a little crush on Chase as he watched the news broadcast  in front of our eyes on yesterday's Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, our female intern who is not sweaty Carrie Ann is screening calls today.  And I only get to hear one-sided conversations. 
[00:21:30]  You know, I look at the people who work on this show with me and I say, well, you know,  I better make sure there's no issues of sexual harassment that come up.  And those issues don't come up.  Not with the staff of this show.  But apparently, I have to worry about all of you listening.  Because I only get to hear one half of the phone conversation.  But she's next to me screening calls.  And I just hear her say, no, I'm not the sweaty intern.  And no, I'm not wearing a thong.  So, I appreciate everybody really going the high road this morning as you're calling the 
[00:22:00]  Opie and Anthony pre-show.  Really.  Thanks.  Really means a lot.  But, joking aside on this story that we were talking about yesterday, the DMV story, what's  great about the Opie and Anthony show is they just break it down, Opie and Anthony and Jim,  to what makes sense.  And they kind of were left with, regardless of political views, let's look at the common  sense of this.  This kid was not trying to disguise himself.  Listen to them break this down in track seven. 
[00:22:30]  So, oh, this is the DMV policy.  At no time will an applicant be photographed when it appears that he or she is purposely  altering his or her appearance so that the photo would misrepresent his or her identity.  All right, pause that.  The DMV does, however.  That's the statement.  That doesn't.  We get that.  But that's not happening here.  No, common sense tells you that that means coming in with a prosthetic nose, chin, fake  mustache, eyebrows, all that shit.  If you look at somebody and go, all right, they are trying to misrepresent who they are, 
[00:23:00]  use common sense.  Know it.  That kid is just wearing makeup that obviously he wears every day.  It's not meant to try to fool anybody.  It's ridiculous.  Come on, people.  Let's fucking think.  What a bunch of dummies in this country now.  What a country of dummies.  It's looking for people to tell us what we're supposed to do.  Think.  Fuck.  Thank you.  Good for you.  I know. 
[00:23:30]  Good for me.  You're an ally.  That was strong.  Yes.  That was really strong.  Anthony for president.  Let's get the rest of this.  Would that be a horrible thing?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we wouldn't like that too much.  Anthony for councilman would be a horrible thing.  Yes.  Dog catcher or whatever.  Dog catcher.  You never can say that these guys are not grounded in reality.  Damien in Illinois.  Welcome to the pre-show.  Morning, Sammy.  Morning, buddy.  Well, first of all, I'll say about your intern answering the phone. 
[00:24:00]  I didn't give her a crowd.  She's very nice.  Very professional.  She's awesome.  Did she sound like she was wearing a thong?  No comment.  Go ahead, Damien.  Do you guys have your work cut out for you trying to figure out the best of the week?  This has been one of the best weeks ever.  I mean, Pat Monaghan, Bully Ray, with the E-Rod.  Pat Monaghan was one of my favorite interviews ever.  Because everybody just clicked. 
[00:24:30]  It's like they were interviewing each other.  It was like the back and forth.  Yeah, I mean, I think that's what makes a lot of the things that happen on the ONA show so different,  is that it's not a traditional interview.  Like, Pat Monaghan is going to do interviews all over the place.  They're going to be asking him about a train, asking him about this, asking him about that.  But when he comes in, he's able to just come in and hang out.  He hung out for like 45 minutes the other morning.  Yeah, it was just so awful.  You know, not many shows have that click where you have a guy come in and actually do an interview. 
[00:25:00]  But, you know, it's just like back and forth.  Like, oh, what did you do before radio?  Oh, I did this.  It was like a couple of buddies talking at a bar.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Thanks, Damien.  Yeah, he's right.  And if you missed any of that, of course, tomorrow morning starting fresh at 6 a.m. Eastern will be the best of the week.  And what we do is we take the best of the week and then we mix it in with some of the long-form gems that you might have forgotten about in ONA history. 
[00:25:30]  So you get a splash of everything that makes up the Opie and Anthony show.  But it is.  It's going to be an excellent best of the week show this weekend starting tomorrow, Friday morning, right here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  It's 6 a.m. Eastern.  Still today, live radio to come, about five minutes away from the Opie and Anthony show.  Dick Cheney.  I'm sure we're going to get into Dick Cheney because he's kind of come out and he's gotten all this heat because he's saying that Obama is blowing it in Iraq. 
[00:26:00]  He's been wrong about so much.  And I think you've got to put your politics aside.  And if you're Dick Cheney, just don't say anything about Iraq ever.  Like, it doesn't matter.  Like, whatever you agree with or don't agree with or who you vote for or whatever, like, you have to admit it's a terrible idea for Dick Cheney to say anything about what anybody's doing anywhere near Iraq.  But I'm interested to hear what Opie and Anthony and Jim have to say about that. 
[00:26:30]  And they'll – I mean, like, once you're out of office, just go home.  Like, don't be – you don't have to be in politics anymore.  You're not the vice president.  You don't have to have an opinion on these things anymore.  Just go home.  Be like George W. Bush.  Start painting weird pictures of people.  Like, don't even worry about it anymore.  That's what I would do anyway.  I mean, I – please.  Go back to shooting your friends or whatever.  Like, anything besides politics. 
[00:27:00]  It's crazy.  Some people can't get away, though.  We'll get into it today on the Opie and Anthony show.  So the one thing that I'm interested in, aside from the Iraq update, is he here?  We don't know.  I haven't said.  I haven't said.  Iraq, of course, we've been tracking the whereabouts of Iraq as if he was, as Jim Norton would say,  Carmen Sandiago.  We've been tracking him throughout the week.  We thought he was in Florida.  The evidence built up that he was in Italy. 
[00:27:30]  We think that he's due back at work today.  Will he be back running the board, looking up bikini girls?  I don't know for sure.  Only time will tell, but it's only a few minutes until that time tells.  The other thing that we have to find out is whether or not these microphones are going to work.  I mean, the studio has been a disaster.  I would say every other day or so for the last two weeks.  The guys actually, believe it or not, stayed after yesterday.  They were in studio after the show was over yesterday to test these microphones. 
[00:28:00]  The entire Opie and Anthony Poe show yesterday was pretty much a mic test between Mars, our engineer, and myself.  I mean, listen to how things went at the top of the show yesterday with the mics.  Oh, Mars!  Jack, one, two.  Hi, everybody.  Isn't it?  It's horrible.  It sounds a little weird.  It's distorted and way basic.  Listen to that.  Hi, how you doing, everybody?  I'm in a tin can.  There's no processing on it.  If you need to know, you have no processing on your microphone. 
[00:28:30]  Where's Mars?  Is he hiding?  Is he doing a walkabout?  He's doing a walkabout.  He's doing a walkabout?  He was just in here.  Where is he?  He reattached the original mic, I think.  Well, I don't know why he did that.  Just go back to what we had yesterday, please.  Everything is going well.  We had a pretty good show yesterday, and now we have to start with this shit.  So he put it through my button, so now I can use my button, but now the mic stinks.  Here comes Mars.  All right.  Let's see what happened. 
[00:29:00]  In the thrilling, what's going on with Anthony's mic?  Oh, Mars, this is bad.  It's really bad.  This is bad.  What happened?  Did you test it before the show?  Yeah.  So right now...  Yeah.  Could you talk on mic?  At least maybe we...  We can what?  Could you talk on mic?  At least maybe we can make radio out of this.  All right.  Yeah, let me hear what he has to say.  What do we need to do?  Well, we needed to give you control back to the mic.  Yeah.  On and off.  I'd rather...  You see, if we have a choice, we'd rather have good mic, no control. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Better than bad mic control.  Right.  What is it right now?  Oh, my God.  Listen to this.  Do you hear this?  Hey, everybody.  Isn't it tin canny?  Can I give you compression right now as we speak?  Yeah.  I'll give you fucking compression.  Give him compression.  Hey, give me compression.  What?  Does it sound any better?  No.  What are you doing?  I don't see you doing anything.  I have someone else.  Well, I'm trying to give you compression.  Oh, someone's in the other room doing something?  Oh.  Does that sound any better?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  No, it's...  Listen. 
[00:30:00]  Listen.  Yeah, I hear it.  You hear that?  Yeah, I hear that.  Ah.  Oh.  Meh.  I sound like a kazoo.  No.  Oh.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Just to let you know, uh-uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Listen, it's really difficult to replicate the room when you're not here.  What?  That means I have to open every mic, and I did that this morning.  Uh-huh.  I got some people in here.  Oh, boy.  Um, who, Helen Keller?  yeah if i named the people you'd be like oh boy another engineer yeah denny falcone oh denny 
[00:30:30]  falcone so we were trying to work on the mics and uh well it seemed like that one worked better  than the other one oh well dennis falcone was in early once again was he testing mics i don't know  will the mics work it remains to be seen as i said tom papa will be on the opian anthony show  today we'll get into the msnbc news anchor that didn't want to say redskins we'll get into the  dick cheney stuff on iraq is erot here do the mics work questions all to be answered today 
[00:31:00]  on the opian anthony show which begins live right now  so  so  so 
[00:31:30]  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show them.  Thank you.  255-55-gallon drums and whiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayors.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys.  With bottle rockets and bra bombings.  And wieners and pigs. 
[00:35:30]  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  They've met friends along the way.  I have a raging heart on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations,  it's the one show that remains unscathed. 
[00:36:00]  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else...  real.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  How's everybody today?  Good?  Delightful. 
[00:36:30]  I was just moving my lips into the microphone but not talking.  And Opie was looking like...  Are you an idiot?  Thank you.  No, no, I wasn't buying that.  No, no.  Thought it would be a funny little laugh.  All right, everybody.  That sounds good.  Sounds better, right?  Yeah.  Is that you, Mars?  Mars, is that all you?  How much shit did he get yesterday?  Marcellino.  How much shit did he get yesterday?  A whole bunch.  A whole bunch of shit.  A whole bunch of shit.  A nice shit sandwich. 
[00:37:00]  Shit storm.  Was it a shit storm?  Shit storm, shit sandwich.  Where are we at?  Calling out Mr. Greenstein wasn't a good thing for me.  Damn.  Damn.  Why?  F5 shit storm?  Yeah.  Then he calls a big boss.  The buttocks of God.  Big boss called me and said, what the fuck are you doing?  Damn.  So because Greenstein's not on top of it, he has to make it hurt for you.  Shit flows downhill, my man.  Because he's the guy that's not on top of it.  Because we've had studio issues for I don't even know how long at this point.  Please, Opie. 
[00:37:30]  What?  No, Mr. Greenstein.  Yeah, but that's bullshit.  Please.  That trickle-down shit is bullshit.  He should take responsibility.  Because we've been telling him about the studio for a very long time.  So now he's going to give you shit through your supervisor?  They're well aware now.  Is my mic on?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  They're well aware now?  But my point is, we can make this very quick, you shouldn't have got any shit sandwich yesterday.  No, I didn't.  Okay?  Because it's been an issue for a very, very long time, and everyone knows that. 
[00:38:00]  Well, we had Tony Marciello and...  Tony!  Yeah, he was here yesterday.  Ed was here, and the guy that...  Love the Tony.  The dream team.  That is the dream team.  The dream team was here.  And the guy that designs Klotz.  And they're very well aware.  What, did they get him out of retirement?  Yeah.  In a retirement home?  Do you know how much not fun that party sounds like?  Oh, God, right?  Tony and Ed were here.  Tony's all right.  Ed's a little weird.  Is Ed the one left?  The names are terrible.  Yes.  But right.  Tony and Ed.  Tony, Ed, and the guy that designed that.  Just jabbering with electronic shit. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, we've got to run a wire through...  Oh, God.  Get pulled out.  Give me some slack.  You guys know Ed.  Like Ed.  Ed rules.  Of course.  We know him all.  Ed knows his shit.  From the old days.  Very smart man.  But you shouldn't have gotten any shit.  Period.  Because the company's fully aware.  That the studio's far apart.  Nice.  Yeah, you're good.  Turn my switch on now for live reads.  Good.  What about the call button?  Let me see.  There it is. 
[00:39:00]  That's nice.  I want to also thank the building for giving me a major problem to...  Just because I needed to get in here today.  Because I don't have my badge.  Same boat.  You know, the sacred badge that gets you in and out of this building.  And God forbid you come here without it.  Yeah.  Even though they see you every day.  Although most of the guys are cool down there.  Like, oh, all right.  I see you every day.  Get the hell out of here.  Get upstairs and do your job.  Get to the elevator and start.  You daffy bastard.  Yeah.  But of course it had to be a...  It was a new woman.  It was a...  A brand new woman. 
[00:39:30]  A security woman.  There's a type.  There is a type.  Let's just say that.  You know what?  I'm in on this one.  You're all in.  I dip my toes.  I dip my toes every once in a while.  You're all in.  Oh, boy.  But there is a certain type...  Yeah.  ...that loves power.  Loves a little authority.  And they love showing that power and authority.  Yeah.  Yes.  Today, downstairs...  Yeah.  It's a black woman.  Black women, they really like to be in a position of that wacky power. 
[00:40:00]  Large and in charge.  It's silly power, by the way.  Yeah.  It's not real.  It means nothing in the end.  Meter maid type stuff.  Right.  Yeah.  They will never give you a break.  Traffic enforcement.  They will give you a break.  They're the one...  They will not give you a break.  Period.  Okay.  No.  No.  So...  No.  I even said to Kenny, we pulled up and I go, oh, boy.  I just knew.  Yeah.  I just knew.  I was stereotyping, I guess.  Well, she was told that if you don't have an ID, you now have to go through the system. 
[00:40:30]  We get your ID out there.  She's got to print you a pass.  Well, that's all well and good if she knew how to spell.  Oh, shit.  She didn't know how to spell.  Oh, what happened?  She goes, I need a CID.  I go, here's my ID.  And Kenny's like, I could vouch for him.  Vouch?  What is this?  I could vouch for him.  Vouching.  He's a good fella.  He's with us.  Right.  She goes, I need to call my supervisor. 
[00:41:00]  I'm like, I've got to be upstairs in five minutes.  I told her.  I go, you're not calling your supervisor.  Is she new here?  Because I've never seen her before today.  I guess she's filling in for somebody.  I don't know.  But I go, look, man.  I don't have an ID right now.  They're working on getting another ID.  This has been happening all week.  And everyone else has just let me through because they see me every day.  Yeah.  Well, I need to see your ID.  So I show her.  Uh-huh.  And then it began. 
[00:41:30]  Her attempting to spell my last name, which is a very easy one.  That G-H will throw some people.  It's not that complicated.  H-I-T-L-U-R.  She starts by spelling my last name G-H-U.  Wait, wait.  G-H-U.  How is that Hughes?  You want to go down and ask it yourself?  Hughes.  Hughes.  I go, just get rid of the G and you got my name. 
[00:42:00]  Egg Hughes.  So then she gets rid of the G and the H.  So now my name starts with a U.  Hughes.  I'm like, it's not.  I go, add the H.  Oh, no.  So then she adds the H and the U.  So now it's H-U-U.  I go, look.  Where are you from?  I start screaming.  I'm like, listen to me.  Uh-huh.  Start over.  And like I'm talking to my little kid. 
[00:42:30]  I go, H?  She gets the H and looks at me.  I'm like, you.  Oh, I see where you're going with this.  And I had to spell it out one letter at a time.  Literally.  Really slowly.  Yeah.  Extremely slowly.  And then she goes, oh, there you are.  And I go, yeah, I've been telling you that the whole time.  Oh, boy.  And then I, so I take off.  Because she goes, there you are.  She goes, you're going to need your pass. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, shit.  And I go, I don't need my pass.  She goes, oh, yes, you do.  Or you're going to be going through this all day.  Bad news.  I go, no, I'm not.  No, you sit down here and then you leave.  I love the exchange that you're going to be doing this.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  Because as I get upstairs, everyone knows who we are.  They're not going to be asking me for a day pass.  I had to get a day pass.  A day pass.  Well, you weren't alone.  I know.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  Because I, too, do not have my identification. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, no.  Well, I tried to have my photo taken, but they would not allow gender nonspecific photographs.  Your species nonspecific.  Human nonspecific.  They forced you to take off mommy's shoes.  Yes, mommy's shoes.  I didn't forget.  You had to take off mommy's shoes.  Exactly.  Give me this shit.  Thanks, Sam.  Yeah.  Sam, hey.  All right.  Sam Roberto. 
[00:44:00]  So I come in, and I'm like, I'm at bed, and Kenny goes, oh, boy, GH had a problem with  her.  Right.  I was like, okay.  So I go in, and Kenny goes, he doesn't have his ID either, ma'am.  Oh, no.  What did she say?  And he goes, but he's in the system.  So she goes, well, I got to see an ID anyway.  There you go.  So I'm like, okay.  So I pulled my ID out.  You're a little nicer about it, huh?  I said, don't you worry about it, because I'd just like to know that I'm safe here in 
[00:44:30]  the building, and you're doing a fantastic job.  And she said, thank you very much.  So I gave her the ID.  Right.  She printed out the badge, so I was ready to go, and she goes, oh, wait, we got to run  your bag through the x-ray machine.  What?  The same bag you bring up every day.  Every day.  So I was like, oh, there's just a camera and a computer in here.  So she's like, oh, they didn't turn the machine on.  So then Kenny just goes, well, you could look in it.  He goes, there, that, that's just, and there's an A, there's some C4. 
[00:45:00]  Did he say that?  Yeah, yeah.  So she laughed, actually, and went, oh, I bet there's an AK-47 in there.  I went, no, no.  I go, I'm petrified of guns.  And she goes, me too, me too.  Okay, you go upstairs.  It was great.  She was totally fine.  Does she understand?  I don't know, but.  Okay.  Does she understand?  Let's just put it this way.  I don't think she understands much of anything.  What you walked to the elevator with?  With my computer and my camera.  All right, well.  It's wonderful.  Maybe other things. 
[00:45:30]  Proving that building security is a complete waste of time.  A lot of fun.  I mean, I'm glad it got some people some jobs, sure.  Oh, yes.  But I don't feel safer because of these people.  It's fake security.  That are downstairs in these buildings.  It's a joke.  It's a complete joke.  Fake security.  Because what?  It doesn't do anything.  A guy that wants to, you know, do harm in this building, he's going to stop and go through  that?  And go, oh boy, I wasn't expecting her to be there.  Oh, fuck.  Fucking me.  Oh, drats.  It fucks my whole plan up. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, drats.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, wouldn't you?  Whatever.  You could do anything.  You could just steal a badge.  You could.  Right.  They don't check the badge to see if it's you on the badge.  As long as it goes beep, you're good.  Beep.  Oh, boy.  Are we telling everybody?  Uh-oh.  Security breach.  A lot of security breaches here today.  It's crazy.  When you don't have your badge and you have a bag with you, they make you put it.  I've done that before because I forget my ID like once every two weeks.  That'd be great.  A giant dildo.  I know I always smuggle that in my asshole. 
[00:46:30]  But even if this one annoys me, even when guys have seen me many times.  Yeah.  That's the new one.  It's like, all right, she's never seen me before.  But when guys I see fucking three times a week make you go through that, that's what  annoys me.  I assume it's because they have no idea if you've been fired or not, and maybe you're  not supposed to be in the building.  I don't know.  I mean, as soon as we get up here, wouldn't they know?  Because then we have to go through other security.  It's whatever.  I guess they are trying to keep disgruntled employees. 
[00:47:00]  The old disgruntled employee.  Right.  Yeah.  The first line of defense.  Yes, the first line of defense.  I bet they tell them that when they get the job.  You are the first line of defense.  Are you kidding me?  You are just as important as...  And then they name people that are important.  Just annoy the shooter until he kills himself.  Yes.  Keep asking for ID until the police get there.  I would bet a lot of money her last job was at a fast food joint.  And now she's building security.  Absolutely think you're right.  I would bet a lot of money on that.  Yeah.  Or something similar to that. 
[00:47:30]  May I help you.  Indeed.  So, yeah.  I dip my toes a little bit.  Yeah.  I do some of that profiling.  When I see a black woman, I know she's going to give me the biz.  Black woman in a uniform.  Especially because of these lovely blue eyes of mine.  Well, she probably profiled you, too.  Like, oh, here's another male model that thinks she's going to walk on through.  With a perfect body.  I just think of, what the hell was it, 48 Hours, when Eddie Murphy went into the bar.  And he gives that little speech about what everybody's worst nightmare is. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  And that makes a lot of sense with the black women that are running things.  Let's say hi to Ian in Jersey.  Ian.  Ian.  Hey, Ian.  Ian.  Ian Murphy.  Do you feel safer or have a sense of security knowing that Anthony carries a gun?  That something goes down that he can be able to.  I don't know what Anthony carries.  I have no idea, man.  I don't have it all the time.  So, who knows? 
[00:48:30]  Who knows?  Yeah.  Right.  Who knows what any of us is carrying?  Well, I think we...  I couldn't formulate an edge joke.  I don't know.  You know, you've got to take care of some things.  I'll tell you, when I'm home or out on the streets and stuff, and I know, you know...  Right.  I know that I'm exercising my rights, you know, it's one...  At least you know you're on even ground.  It's no guarantee.  There's a huge responsibility that goes along with it. 
[00:49:00]  But you at least know you're on even footing with somebody that wants to do you harm.  Right.  That's all.  It feels really safe, because Jim's carrying them double cums.  Yeah.  Good call.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  So, that's how our day started today.  But the mic's working.  That's good.  The mic's working, and someone else is working.  I hear...  Oh, E-Rock's back. 
[00:49:30]  Ah, E-Rock.  E-Rock is back from Florida.  E-Rock.  How was your vacation?  We got to know.  E-C-C.  Bon giorno.  Ah, bon giorno.  Bon giorno.  Isn't that, uh...  I don't know what it is.  I don't know.  No, that's bonjour.  Ah.  Wait, so it's C-C-C.  Yes.  What does that mean?  Yes.  Oh, it means yes. 
[00:50:00]  Yes, yes, yes.  Ah, very good.  Paisan.  So, uh...  Did you have a good time?  Yes, Naples, Florida was amazing.  Oh.  What makes Naples...  Oh, Naples, Florida.  Naples.  You were a little scared that we were going to find out that you went to Italy, I guess,  huh?  No, I wasn't scared.  I just wasn't telling you this time.  Why?  Well, let's see.  I'm sure there's plenty of best-of segments where you've called me at various vacations  or at home and...  Yeah, but it's now a bit.  Yeah.  We're concerned about it.  It's now a bit. 
[00:50:30]  We've got to continue the bit.  No, you don't have to continue the bit.  And it's a lot harder.  Or, you know, go overseas and...  We missed you by one day at one of the hotels.  Right.  I was moving around a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was moving around a lot.  Trying to stand the cover.  Didn't the guy at the hotel go, oh, he left yesterday.  Yes, Mr. Nagel, you left yesterday.  We're like, fuck.  We almost had you.  Ah, shit.  What'd you see?  Where'd you go?  I went to six different cities, which was fun. 
[00:51:00]  Wow.  Did you really?  Yeah.  In six days?  Seven days?  Yep.  Wow.  Damn.  What were the cities?  Well, the big ones being Rome and Florence.  Right.  Went to a city called Assisi.  Assisi.  Like St. Anthony Assisi?  Assisi.  Probably.  Right.  That's usually where it all comes from, anyway.  One of those.  Okay.  Siena.  Francis Assisi, or whatever.  Siena.  Siena, which was very nice.  Right.  Uh, this one is hard to pronounce. 
[00:51:30]  Diane.  San, uh, Jimmy, San Jimmy.  Sandwich?  Let's go with sandwich.  Uh, sandwich, San Jimmy, G-I-M-I-G-N-A-N-O.  San Giamano?  Giamano.  How many days in each city?  One day?  Um, some cities were, uh, two days.  Uh, no, it was two cities in one day.  A couple days in another city.  Were you flying or checking the train?  Driving.  Oh, you rented a car.  Drive.  Is that the other side of the road?  Nope.  Italy is pretty much America. 
[00:52:00]  Mama Mia.  Italy is pretty much America.  Yep.  Signs are the same, uh, gas stations right off the highway are all the same.  Yeah.  Wherever you're going, you can figure it out.  Double signs?  You don't know the language.  Double signs on the road?  Italian and American?  Nope.  Or English or whatever?  All Italian.  Unless you're in, uh, some of the major cities, it's all Italian.  Yeah.  But you could figure out that kilometer stuff.  Yeah, I guess.  No, I couldn't.  I'm not going to be speeding.  If you have the dashboard reversed for the ones that aren't digital, the kilometers are  on the top in the big numbers.  Oh, I see.  You've got to kind of look, uh, oh, boy. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, boy.  Well, that sounds fun.  Yeah, it's great.  And of course, uh, what is the food like there?  Um, obviously, pasta is amazing.  But just like, uh, any place that you go, you have to know or find out what the good restaurants  are compared to.  Because there's good ones and bad ones?  Well, they have a lot of rows that look like Little Italy, where they're all just standing  outside, holding a menu, trying to get you into the restaurant, and you don't go to those  ones.  Oh, okay.  You can find some of the nicer ones.  What makes, uh, their spaghetti so, or their pasta so much better?  They make it all in the restaurant.  Like, you can see it. 
[00:53:00]  So why can't we do that here?  New York, you can't find good Italian food.  How's the Italian food in this place?  I had Italian food the other night.  I've never been to this place.  It's hard.  I mean, you go down to Little Italy, of course.  No, this is on the Upper East Side.  Yeah, but the rest of Manhattan, it's really tough to get just a solid plate of pasta.  It's delightful.  It was good, huh?  Yeah, someone told me, I don't normally get a good Italian food.  Yeah.  I'd like to meet her, Rupert.  Anyway.  You can have all the food laid out.  You pick your meat, you pick your, uh, your seafood, your shellfish. 
[00:53:30]  You can see them making the pasta.  Your shellfish.  Yeah.  And, uh, no consumer reviews, uh, no consumer reviews about the Italian food.  There'll be some.  Okay.  Not only the ones that Americans are interested in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to go international with the consumer?  The consumer international.  International.  So no problems?  Everything went smooth?  No, everything was great.  That's fucking cool.  Just you and your wife, right?  And, uh, family.  Oh, you did family.  A bunch of family went, too. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, okay.  The whole Nagel clan.  I would have taken today and tomorrow off, though.  Yeah.  And really extend your vacation.  Yeah.  Didn't want to do that.  See, see.  Why?  Because I didn't want to use all the days.  It'll be one more day, right?  Yeah, but then I'm still here tomorrow.  Oh, right.  Okay.  So.  Mm.  That would have been a great little movie.  The Nagels go to Italy or something.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  The Nagels go to Italy.  Do what airline?  United.  Were they okay?  It was, uh, on the way, way back, the staff just sucked, but the flight itself wasn't bad. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  Yeah, they're not happy people.  No, especially when they're...  The United staff sucks.  It's been my experience.  The, uh, the Russian lady...  I fucking hate United still, by the way.  Damn!  Not over it.  How about you acknowledge that I put in a complaint, at least?  Oh, boy.  You know how many people put in complaints?  They don't care.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't.  Kenny?  They don't care.  Oh, here comes Kenny.  Have they acknowledged our complaint yet?  Kenny.  Yes, I did get the response yesterday.  Oh!  Yesterday? 
[00:55:00]  Of all days, then?  Yes.  The lost luggage is going to be a training issue.  But it's a plane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A training issue?  What does that mean?  What?  They're going to have, you know, teach their staff to be more empathetic.  That's good.  Okay.  Yeah.  Most of the staff cannot pronounce empathetic that handles the luggage.  And they put in a request to refund the airfare because he got bumped from first to coach because of the change of plane. 
[00:55:30]  So they put in a request.  Oh, they're in a request.  It's going to come.  Well, he's never done this before.  He's going to put in a request.  You're a fucking liar.  And they reminded me that you got a $250 travel voucher, and that will be all the compensation.  Oh, shit.  That's it, motherfucking.  That's all they give you for...  They're just a shit.  I don't even know where that is anymore.  Well, that's all I'm going to... 
[00:56:00]  I lost it in the luggage.  Uh-oh.  I really did.  They lose your luggage and knock you out of first, and give you $250.  What a shit airline.  Righteous.  But it wasn't about...  Ah, whatever.  It was more about splitting up the young family.  I didn't really care in the end that I was knocked out of first class.  First class.  I just wanted us all together to make it easier.  I would have cared.  I would have been annoyed if I booked first class, and they told me I can't fly first  class.  I'm fucking pissed.  It happens.  Well, obviously, I care.  But then, at that point, I just wanted us all to sit together, and they just didn't  give a fuck about that whatsoever. 
[00:56:30]  And other than a change of plane, they didn't address it at all.  I usually just bang on the cockpit door and go, then let me sit in here.  Yeah.  Open up.  I want to meet the pilot.  Right.  Make sure he's competent as we're taking off.  Yes.  What do they say about the floozy that they put in first class, when it was between  the floozy and a young family?  That wasn't addressed.  You didn't write floozy in our complaint?  No, I kept it professional.  You should have.  You should have wrote, what about the floozy?  Keep it professional. 
[00:57:00]  It's very good.  Yeah.  No, I like to take the high road.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  You can call her.  Floozy is taking the high road, if you think about it.  That's true.  Do you know what you could call her?  There's plenty of other words.  Wow.  All right.  Well, that's good.  And the Nagel trip was a success.  So you flew a United Airlines flight business?  Why were they?  There's no business section on international flight.  It's called Economy Plus.  Oh, shit.  It's supposed to be business. 
[00:57:30]  It's supposed to be three classes.  Yeah, Economy Plus, Economy, and First Class.  What kind of plane?  767.  Damn.  But why was the staff shitty?  Well, on the way back, it wasn't...  A wide body and a wide body.  Iraq, I apologize for Anthony's insensitive and body dysmorphia comments about you.  I got a lot of texts asking me if I was at the Vatican, Jim.  Oh, the Vatican.  Wow.  How did we miss that one?  Did you say it?  I must have misspoken. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  But it was not meant.  No.  My humble apologies.  Why was it?  Oh, no.  I want to know why they were shitty.  Maybe the ethnicity of the people.  Ethnicity?  Ethnicity.  Ethnicity.  Ethnicity.  Ethnicity.  I got the word wrong.  You're speaking Italian still.  Yes, you did.  The ethnicity of the stewardesses probably played into why they weren't the most friendliest.  Interesting.  They were from being from Russia. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, they were Russia.  Oh, Russia.  Sit down.  Shut up.  Right?  That's right.  You sit down.  You have a Bloody Mary.  Would you like lap dance?  Yeah.  They're trying to get you to give them 20 bucks.  Sit down and have a Bloody Mary.  So they give you the cup with the tomato juice and they give you the bottle of vodka.  Sure.  And you obviously do not have enough tomato juice to finish the bottle of vodka.  So you want the can.  Right?  For the Bloody Mary mix.  Uh-huh.  I understand completely.  They're walking away.  Can I have the can?  No.  Why?  And then she wouldn't give me the can. 
[00:59:00]  Why?  Is it a weapon or something?  And I'm like, what the fuck?  And then she did it to this other guy in a row behind me.  He had a soda or something.  He said, can I just have the can?  And no, she wouldn't do it.  Did you ask if you could have another cup and then pour it into the other cup?  Well, how about that?  They don't give you the can because it's metal or something.  But they did it on the flight there.  Yeah, there's never any real.  So what?  They have a whole bunch of cans with, you know.  Half filled.  Half.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Fucks is what it is.  That is true. 
[00:59:30]  But when you get other, what do they call it, flight attendants now, not stewardesses.  Yeah.  They're stewardesses.  If you ask the other people or, you know, maybe the gentlemen who are handling those  responsibilities, like, no, they can't.  Sure, here you go.  They're giving you napkins.  Oh, yeah.  Why is it degrading to call them waitresses?  Because that's all they really are.  What else do they really do?  Because if a restaurant was plummeting toward Earth, the waitresses wouldn't know what to  do.  Oh, and the flight attendants. 
[01:00:00]  They're trained in safety procedures.  Oh, are they?  Really?  Right.  Okay.  Let's say you're hanging out at your favorite restaurant, and it all of a sudden loses cabin  pressure.  Sure.  What's the waitress going to do?  What is the skirtess going to do?  Nothing.  She'll know, you know.  Oh, stop it.  All right, everyone, put on your mask.  At that point, I just hope we have a really good, trained pilot.  Is that it?  Yeah.  I'm not counting on the waitress in the sky for anything.  What do you got, Kenny?  They like to be called plane servants.  I bet they hate that one. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, plane servant.  Hey, plane servant.  Fetch me a pillow.  Fetch me a pillow.  Oh, boy.  That would be a treat.  Think they don't like that?  No.  Too bad.  You know what?  We don't like the fact that now there's no fucking, like, early retirement age.  They should be out of there a lot of that.  Exactly.  20 years.  Yes.  Yeah, yes.  At least.  And a weight restriction.  130. 
[01:01:00]  Yes.  Because in the old days, they knew it was a silly job, so they at least made them look  hot.  They were hot.  It was part of the allure of flying.  Or they hired hot girls.  You know, part of the allure.  And some feminist douchebag.  Some do-gooder had to say.  And we want, and us women, what us women need is...  Oh, really?  Did you even get a pillow, E-Rock, on your flight?  Yeah, they give you a pillow and a blanket that's pre-packaged. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, okay.  Nice.  I do like those pre-packaged pillows.  I do, too.  How was Rome?  Rome was amazing.  Did you see the ruins?  I did.  Did you see the Colosseum?  I did.  That's cool as fuck.  And I saw the Vatican.  Could you go into the Colosseum?  Yeah.  We went up...  In fact, we paid for this private tour that took you to the catacombs below the Colosseum,  so they show you where the gladiators would come in from.  Yesterday, I called you gladiated.  Yes, I saw it.  Your fans like to repost your comment. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you saw that one?  That was funny.  They bring you in through these catacombs where there's water dripping and it's cave-like.  They show you where the gladiators would come in, set up, get ready to perform.  They had a whole elevator system with pulleys that they would bring the lions and everything up.  Yeah, the movie was great.  Apparently, this thing wasn't open until like four years ago.  Really?  I thought it was open thousands of years ago.  No, the catacombs.  Oh.  They weren't letting you down there.  Why not?  I guess safety issues. 
[01:02:30]  They opened it 16 years ago, then they shut it, and then they only reopened it like four  years ago.  So not many people have seen that.  No.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  So you get to go under and you look up from under the...  They rebuilt part of the stage because it was all wood, and you look up from there and  you can see all the way to the top, which is cool.  And then they bring you all the way to the top of the Coliseum, and you get to look down.  How much is the tour?  I don't know.  Is it big compared to a baseball stadium?  How big is it?  Yeah, like a minor league.  Minor league stadium, like Bears Stadium, Newark, kind of a thing? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, about that size.  Yankee Stadium, like half of Yankee Stadium or something like that?  It's much smaller than Yankee Stadium.  Much smaller than Yankee Stadium, yeah.  Trying to get a grasp on it.  Like a hockey arena?  Maybe a little smaller than that.  It's in better shape than the Nassau Coliseum, though, right?  That it is.  All right.  1983, I get it.  Yes.  Gladiators fared better than the Islanders.  Okay.  Enough.  But Rome is a lot like London and New York.  It has a lot... 
[01:03:30]  Like, all the buildings can't be touched.  Like, you can't do repairs and things.  And massive remodeling you can't do.  If you're going to fix some stuff, that's fine.  But you've got to keep the original authentic look.  Right, right.  But the stores that come in in the center and certain areas of Rome  all have, like, a New York and London feel.  Like Trump can't put his name across the Leaning Tower of Pisa?  No, no, no.  No, people will love it.  It's a great name.  It's a great sign.  Yeah.  But it's very cosmopolitan.  A lot of good restaurants and hotels.  Every designer is there in the main square there. 
[01:04:00]  Wow.  So...  I've got to go.  Yeah.  A lot of great parks.  They have a park that's almost equivalent to Central Park.  Right.  And it's just amazing to walk through.  Bikes and people taking, you know, wine and picnics and...  Wine.  A lot of bridges over the...  Each bridge is different over the river going through Rome.  So those are amazing to walk over.  And the whole place is just...  I needed more time there.  Did you see any war damage?  Yeah, yeah, well...  From the big war?  Yeah, there's certain buildings that they show you. 
[01:04:30]  If the building structure was still intact where the building could just be added onto,  you had to keep the original building.  Oh.  So they showed you, like, where Mussolini's palace was.  And they show you the line where they try to match the original marble with...  I forgot what the other stuff is called, but you can see it be rebuilt.  But you can see sort of the lines of where the newer material is compared to the older.  Did you see where they hung him up by his ankles?  They showed you.  They did, huh?  It's not like an X in Dallas, but you could go over there. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, that's where he was celebrated.  They won't let you near it, because I'm sure everyone's going to try to hang off of it.  That would be a selfie.  Will they take a selfie of me hanging by my heels?  That's pretty cool.  In the tour, they show you the only thing that Italy actually recognizes that was positive  from Mussolini was building this road from the palace into the Colosseum so that traffic  could flow and people could come and visit stuff.  But then there's no other talk of Mussolini.  What else did he do?  Yeah, yeah, move along.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  That was his palace.  He built this road moving on to the Colosseum.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  That's it.  That's the only thing. 
[01:05:30]  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  He bit Hitler's weenie.  Now it doesn't work.  How long was the flight?  What are we talking?  Five, six hours?  No, longer.  The flight there was about eight, eight and a half.  Oh, yeah, that's two.  And the flight back was ten.  Oh, fuck.  That's brutal.  That's brutal.  Yeah.  Flew over France.  Well, on the way to Italy, we flew over parts of Canada, Greenland, London, and France.  It goes up to the Arctic Circle and down.  You flew over London?  And flew over France?  Did you fly over Jimmy's underpants? 
[01:06:00]  You said it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy, now.  There were Chinese and Japanese.  My earphones broke.  Yes.  Huh?  No, it's the other thing Ant says.  Oh, yes.  So, yeah, the flight, eight and a half there, ten back.  It was amazing.  You definitely should go over there if you have.  Have you been to Italy, Ant?  Never.  You would like it.  I would.  I know.  I've got to get over there.  Lots of public drinking in the streets.  You can take it from the bar and walk around.  It was World Cup time over there. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, right.  So, they were all crazy for Italy, of course.  Were they nice?  Everybody was extremely nice.  Yeah, nobody was really rude.  And almost everything had an English translation as far as the restaurants, the stores, because  they know where their money's coming from.  Apparently, Italy's destitute right now.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, well, all those fucking European countries are kind of hurting.  Did you feel unsafe at any time or no?  Honestly, no.  I did not.  And I walked around pretty much almost all of Florence and Rome, even the back streets 
[01:07:00]  and stuff, and it never felt...  Now, who was that guy that you took a picture with?  You did have to watch out for gypsies.  They told you about...  Oh, gypsies, tramps and thieves.  Right.  Who was that listener?  Did he just spot you and say, hey, you're on...  This was a weird dude, because we saw him when we got to that hotel.  My whole family saw this guy.  And he's with his family.  Right.  But they all dressed the same.  Like, him and his two brothers all dressed however the dad is dressed.  Oh, gosh.  So each night, like, they had...  So horrible.  Like, they had khakis and a blue blazer and some kind of plaid shirt and brown boat shoes. 
[01:07:30]  And then the next night, they were wearing the same collared shirt with those thin belt  with the gold and dress pants.  So it was really weird.  And then one night, we came back.  It was after midnight in Rome time.  And he was sitting off into this little side area of the lobby, watching the USA Ghana  World Cup game.  Ghana.  Ghana World Cup game.  Just with a big bag of potato chips going into his mouth all by himself.  Oh.  So you're like, hey, can I grab some of them? 
[01:08:00]  I was like, that's a smart idea.  So, no, we had just seen him all over the place.  And he was always kind of looking, so we didn't know.  And then when he approached us, we were outside the hotel and they were getting a car for everybody.  And he just kind of walks through the crowd of my family and comes right up to me, like  right up to me.  He's like, I feel I should know who you are.  Uh-oh.  And I just kind of like, yeah.  Yeah.  And he said, you're E-Rock, right?  And I said, yeah.  I'm a niggle kid.  So he's pretending like he doesn't, oh, I haven't heard the show in a while and what's 
[01:08:30]  going on.  I knew what was going on and I wasn't even listening to the show that you were trying  to find me.  So he's talking to me for a little bit, asking if I like Italy, can I take a photo?  Yes, you can take a photo.  So I took the photo and I said, what's your Twitter?  Oh, I don't have a Twitter.  Really?  You don't have a Twitter?  No.  I don't have a Twitter.  I'm like, do you have an Instagram?  He didn't have all this stuff.  Uh-huh.  So I kept looking.  A few hours later, I saw it pop up.  Yeah, he posted it.  That he had it up there.  He lied?  Of course he lied.  Why would he lie?  Why would he lie?  I have no idea.  Why would any of our fans do anything? 
[01:09:00]  You know?  Right.  So I just didn't want...  They're not a nice people.  Valid point.  I took the photo because I didn't want him doing candids, like posting my family up and stuff like  that, so...  Did you tell him that?  No.  I didn't tell him that, but that's why I did it.  Because as soon as he said Iraq, my wife goes, oh, shit, and just walked away.  And then the family kind of...  She reminded her who she was masked.  Yeah, yeah.  She was convincing herself that you were just her driver taking her there to meet some Italian  gentleman.  Right.  I know my family back home.  Furio.  Yes.  Of an independent means. 
[01:09:30]  But your family must have been impressed.  No, they weren't.  Why not?  They didn't recognize in Rome.  That's pretty...  No, they were annoyed about it.  That's a big deal.  Far one.  So they walked away, and I talked to the guy for a little bit, and then you know the  rest.  You actually talked to them?  Yeah.  Maybe a minute, because then our cars came, and then we went to dinner.  Nice.  More spaghetti.  Sounds like a good trip.  Seafood over there is great, and everything that...  It's amazing the translation, even though they have the same name for dishes, is not 
[01:10:00]  how it's prepared over in Italy and it is in America.  Parmesan is not sauce and cheese and all that.  It's flaked Parmesan, and it's cooked in oil.  Oh.  So when you get chicken Parmesan, it was like pan-seared chicken in an olive oil with scraped  Parmesan on top.  Oh, okay.  That's pretty good stuff.  Yeah.  Everything was good.  And when you get scampi, no pasta, but the shrimp's like this big.  Oh, Jesus.  So you're sitting there, you're cracking the claws, and you're gutting it out with a fork  and everything.  You gotta kill...  You gotta gut your own shrimp?  Yeah.  I don't know if I could do that.  But they're huge shrimp.  They're like this long.  What do you mean? 
[01:10:30]  Do you vein them?  Yeah.  You gotta get rid of that shrimp.  You gotta pull the slug out of the middle.  You know?  The shit in the dirt.  That's who you need.  Don't you just eat the vein?  Who cares?  Oh, it's shit.  No.  It's shrimp duty.  I don't want a shrimp.  Oh, shit.  I eat the vein.  Ah, get that vein out.  Too lazy.  Cut it up nice.  Crack the claws.  Suck it out.  Oh.  It's good.  Crazy.  Sounds good.  I don't like doing my own food like that.  I always fuck up, and I can't get rid of the meat out.  I just want to grab my fork and start shoving.  Yeah.  You don't like putting on a bib and cracking your own lobster? 
[01:11:00]  I don't mind that as much, but that peel-and-eat shrimp stuff is a pain in the ass.  Yeah, they always forget a leg.  Or that covering over the tail of the shrimp.  You get it.  It's a shrimp condom.  You can never get all of it off.  And if you find a place that does shrimp cocktail, not a lot of them do, don't get it  because it's not.  Their cocktail sauce is just a cocktail sauce and mayonnaise.  And it's more mayonnaise than cocktail sauce.  Oh, that sounds horrible.  Yeah, and they just kind of ladle it over the shrimp, so you're not even dipping it in.  That's horrible for shrimp. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, it is horrible.  They should do it our way.  We figured out that shrimp cocktail over here.  Yeah, Americans are assholes over there.  And I've seen it every place.  They all complain they can't get a large iced coffee.  I can't get cheese put on my meal.  Large farba?  Yeah.  We can't make iced coffee, sir?  You have to.  It's cafe, Americano, and then you have to say a couple other things in order to get it.  But it only comes out like that big.  They don't have Starbucks or anything like a Starbucks or in Italy.  They're not piggy boys over there.  People actually eat properly everywhere else. 
[01:12:00]  If you pull over to, I guess, the equivalent of mobile on the run, right, that was on the side of the highways,  you go in there thinking, oh, I'll get a drink or something.  They have a coffee bar in there.  So everyone's just, when they pull over, they get gas, and while the car's being filled up,  they're getting espressos and cappuccinos right at the gas station.  That's weird.  And even, like, if you find a McDonald's or anything like that, right in the front is a huge cafe,  and then you have to go around to the back in order to get to the actual food for a place like that.  Get to the shit food.  Right.  Wait, that means you ate at a McDonald's? 
[01:12:30]  I stopped at one.  I stopped at one.  You stopped at the McDonald's in Italy?  Why would you do that?  I wanted to see how different the menu was.  Yeah.  How different was it?  There was a lot of different stuff on there.  Like what?  Royale with cheese.  Something that we wouldn't expect.  What did they expect?  Their fries are all different.  Mayonnaise on the fries?  God damn!  They give you, instead of ketchup, they look like the chicken nugget sauce,  they put the packets of mayonnaise in the bag.  Wait, why were their fries different? 
[01:13:00]  What do they taste like?  There's different kinds.  They had them cut almost like steak fries, like you would get at KFC.  That's what I'm talking about.  Or you'd get what they called Las Vegas fries, which are the waffle fries.  Wait, instead of, they give you mayonnaise instead of what?  Instead of ketchup?  Ketchup for a French fry.  Yeah, mayonnaise is on everything.  Steak fries are king.  That's my favorite.  That's my favorite French fries.  Yeah, you like that?  Steak fries.  I do like a good killily fries.  Nah.  Killily fries.  Not so much.  Killily fries.  Nice and spicy.  Shoestring.  That's good.  Not so much.  And I like your standard issue, McDonald's fries. 
[01:13:30]  I like a nice steak fry.  And if they try to do anything barbecue, American style, it's barbecue mixed into a whole thing  of mayonnaise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everything's all mayonnaise.  So how was McDonald's?  It was McDonald's.  They don't do ice in anything.  Why?  So if you get a drink, there's no ice in anything.  They just don't do ice.  And you have to specifically ask for it or they don't give it to you.  Because they're trying to give you your money's worth.  Right.  Are there Asian Italians or black Italians?  There were Chinese restaurants throughout Rome.  We saw them. 
[01:14:00]  Were they speaking Italian?  That's what I mean.  I didn't talk to them.  Did you see some Italian guys that were black, though?  I did not see a lot of black guys.  Like African Italians?  But apparently there's a...  I wish I remember the name.  There's a black guy on the Italian World Cup team.  Oh, well.  That has a poster in Rome.  That's it, huh?  Yeah, it's like the guy.  He's the guy, you know.  I want to see a Chinese person speak Italian.  I want to see that.  In Rome.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's got to be there. 
[01:14:30]  That would rule.  How would that sound?  I don't know.  Anything else about your trip?  Oh, yeah.  I had to get my credit card and my bank cards all switched over.  Did you have to have this microchip in your car now?  What's that?  It's microchip.  Why?  Why do you have to have that?  What's that?  Over in Europe, they switched their whole system.  So if you don't have the chip in there, you have to provide ID or your passport or something.  And sometimes it doesn't go through just because you don't have that chip thing. 
[01:15:00]  So how do you get the new ones?  Before you go, you have to order it?  Yeah, you call your bank and your credit card company.  They issue your same card, but it has this chip with all your information.  But what if you...  But what if you...  Yeah, what if you went over there and not...  Supposedly it's coming to the United States.  We just haven't got it yet.  Yeah, what if you went over there and you didn't know this?  Like I said, it would take a lot to use your regular credit card because a lot of places  have these systems where it doesn't always go through.  Some do.  Wait, I'm sorry.  No, it's got to have this little gold chip on the side there. 
[01:15:30]  And what is that made for?  I have one.  Well, it's made for a few different things.  One, it's for, I guess, for identification.  It has all your info on there, especially when you're traveling internationally.  It's there to authorize the use of the card.  But also on your hotel room key, you have the same chip because you can't...  Yes, that card works.  You can't use...  Fuck, now we all have to check our credit cards?  You can't use the power in your room without it.  You can't use the power in your room.  No, so you use it to open the door to your hotel.  Then you put it into this little slot right near the door, and it turns on your air conditioning, 
[01:16:00]  your light, and everything in there.  Because the whole place is so energy conscious that if you leave the room and take the card  off, everything turns off.  So you can't leave the air conditioning on to cool down your room.  Fuck that noise.  Oh, yeah, I've been in hotels like that, but you can leave stuff on...  Bypass that bitch.  Right.  Lickety split.  It shuts everything off.  I got a shitty credit card.  Yeah, look at that.  Why?  Why?  Mine's shit.  Well, that's because I'm an international guy.  Let me see yours.  Why?  Don't go over there.  Whoa. 
[01:16:30]  What is that, a Bank of Mericard?  What the fuck?  Where's my chip?  What's that?  It's my black...  Where's my chip?  I don't know.  I hope he's got a Gimbal's card.  It will work.  Jesus.  Gimbal's.  His charger plate.  I love when you go to a store, you're buying something, and they're like, would you like  a Mace?  No, I wouldn't.  Why would I want that?  I've got a credit card.  I fly a lot.  Buzz off.  Why would I use that?  Shut up.  My no is very aggressive now.  I just go, no.  Because I don't want any follow-up questions. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  He's like, well, but do you understand, sir?  You'll save 4% on your purchase today.  I'm wealthy.  No.  No.  Hell fucking no.  And 4% will be gone with the first purchase.  Whatever it is.  Or they don't give you the sales in the store unless you have it now.  Yeah.  Well, fuck.  I don't touch it.  Where is that from?  Is that what they're doing now?  Yeah, like Dwayne Reed, Walgreens, those kind of things.  You have those little point cards, whatever.  I hate those.  They'll have sales, but you won't get the sales unless you have the card. 
[01:17:30]  I hate those little cards.  They're so small and a clog up my wallet.  You got a CVS card?  No.  Can't use them anywhere else?  Yeah.  Useless.  Take a hike.  It's just so they could then send you junk in your emails and everything else.  Figure out what you're buying and tie it to you and then sell your information to some douche company.  But then also you're paying for your stuff with the interest as well.  Because you can't pay it off right away.  Well, no.  There's some trick there. 
[01:18:00]  There's the credit card going on.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  That's a wonderful trip there, E.  Welcome home, E.  Rock.  They also show Louie a lot over in Italy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I put a clip up on Instagram and Twitter there.  They do these blocks of Family Guy, Simpsons, and Louie.  Oh, God.  So he's all in Italy?  Yeah, and it's a scene where you're playing poker.  So I put the clip up where Jim's getting made fun of.  What?  Let me see that.  And it's all in Italian.  And it's in Italian?  Yeah.  Let's see this.  Here it is.  So he rocked radio on Instagram. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, you speak Italian?  Yes, I do.  Very good.  I didn't know Jimmy spoke Italian.  That's why I have the credit card, because I fly over there, and they have me dubbing  him in Italian.  They fly me over.  First clap.  Private.  They fly me private.  Yes, private.  I saw Jimmy twice throughout the trip.  The one where you were backstage at Dane's concert. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, right.  And that one where you're playing poker.  Yeah, I might go over there, just, you know, some Italian fans.  Ah, buongiorno.  And I'd be like, oh.  Oh, I'll have you know, E-Rock, that we were on VH1 last night for a second and a half.  Oh.  Remember the aughts?  Sex for Sam?  Huh?  No, it was, um...  No, it was Remember the 2000s, which is, you know...  And they showed...  Oh, right, okay.  And they showed, um, Satellite Radio, and they said, uh, remember when Satellite Radio came 
[01:19:30]  out?  And people were like, what?  Pay for radio?  And as they're doing that, they show me and Anthony, uh, for a split second in that horrible  photo shoot.  That terrible promo shot.  But a different picture I've never seen before.  And then, of course, they had to move on and say that the Satellite Radio was in deep,  deep trouble until the great Howard Stern saved everyone's lives.  Yes.  Yuck.  Well, we were on for a split second.  That's great.  That's great.  But they didn't say our names.  No. 
[01:20:00]  Only our fans knew.  So pathetic.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Trying to see if there's anything else.  No one...  The hotels don't, uh, have real bathroom doors.  Why?  What do they have?  Thin-frosted glass.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, how awful is that?  And that dump in there?  It really tests the lengths of your relationship.  Oh, man.  Why?  Because, oh, a lot of those doors, as soon as you're closing, though, you can't really...  Yeah, it's not that way.  Oh.  I thought it was one of those doors where you close it and all of a sudden it turns white.  Right.  No, it's... 
[01:20:30]  You're sliding it.  It's thin-frosted glass.  Like, if you had a glass with too much condensation on it, that's about the protection you've got  on the door.  So you can see kind of a silhouette of you taking a dump in there.  Yeah.  No one wants to look at it and see their wife's knees.  Like, if she's taking it and she's reading the paper.  So they really like, you know, looking at each other, taking...  Dropping hammers.  Yeah.  Dropping hammers.  Some of the hotels didn't have washcloths.  So you're using regular towels to...  They don't understand washcloths?  Or they don't have drawers in there.  They just have a closet where you hang everything, apparently. 
[01:21:00]  So odd.  Where do you put your underwear?  In the suitcase on the floor.  Wow.  There's no point in taking anything out.  Oh, I don't unpack.  They can't make a mixture.  Do you unpack?  If it's going to be, like, a week.  Maybe I get there, yeah.  Dress, pants, and shirts.  I'm just there for a couple of days.  I don't unpack.  I live out of the suitcase.  It depends on how long.  If it's one day, then I'll say...  But if I'm going to be there for four or five days, I'm fucking unpack.  If I'm just there for a weekend anywhere?  Before I shit, I unpack.  Oh.  I do.  That's nice.  Good to know.  It gets all wrinkly.  All right. 
[01:21:30]  Well, welcome home there, Iraq.  Thank you.  You were missed.  Okay, is that it?  Sort of.  We didn't know you were gone for the first day.  And then you were missed.  Well, that's good.  We missed you, Iraq.  We did miss Iraq.  Young Iraq.  We absolutely missed Iraq.  I want to go there now because I want to see those ruins.  That sounds like fun going down.  You'll love Rome.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you're going to take, like, a real vacation.  I know.  Who am I going to go with, though?  Rome.  I have no ladies in my life.  Dude, I was a lady friend.  I need a lady friend.  When we were off the air for two years, I had nobody. 
[01:22:00]  I just traveled by myself.  It was awesome.  Oh, buddy.  It was kind of cool.  Yeah.  It really was.  But you could certainly find a few people to go to Rome.  Easily.  I'd have to go with Jonathan, probably.  My manager.  Yeah.  He'd be like, you know.  He'd be bored.  Because he likes doing crazy trips.  So Rome, to him, must be like, going to, I don't know.  Yeah, he'd be like, let's go to Iraq.  Going to Disney or something.  He'd make friends.  Like, Jonathan could go there alone.  And then by the time he left, the whole fucking, you know, there'd be 400 people walking  to the dock.  Marr!  Waving at him, happy. 
[01:22:30]  Arrivederci.  You know, they'd all be fucking seeing him off with love.  Jonathan is, yeah, he's a special person.  Wherever he goes, he just strikes up conversations and like real deep, good conversations with  people.  Yeah, he can talk to anybody.  I was talking to him last night.  Jonathan could literally hold a conversation with anyone.  But the problem is he could also talk to a wall.  And we've seen that as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If there's no one else around, he will just talk to a wall. 
[01:23:00]  Practice his skills, I guess.  I don't know what it is.  That's how you get good.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll go away for the 4th of July.  It's a couple of days.  Not that, you know, maybe 4th.  Where am I going to go?  Maybe Vegas.  I did a lot of trips by myself.  It was pretty cool, actually.  I don't want to just go with anybody.  I don't want to go with a strange girl.  It's like, you want to have a, you know, someone that you can hang out with.  Oh, that was, thanks for sucking my cock.  That was so much fun.  Let's go look at the ruins.  Oh, okay.  No, no, that's what she's saying to me. 
[01:23:30]  Let's break.  All right.  We got stuff to do today.  Well, you know all the stuff going on.  We'll hit on some of those topics.  Oh, P. and Anthony will be right back on Sirius XM.

Are you one of them?  Hello, I'm Dr. Roger Sidaway.  And as a gastroenterologist, I've been telling my patients for years that in order to keep  things moving, you need to eat fiber, drink plenty of water, and exercise. 
[01:24:30]  Now, I tell my patients to elevate their knees above their waist with the Squatty Potty footstool  when they go.  Here's why.  Anatomically, humans were designed to squat, but then we started sitting, and sitting brought  on problems like constipation and hemorrhoids.  So the real problem is how we sit.  That's why I recommend the Squatty Potty.  The Squatty Potty is so simple because it helps you elevate your knees while enjoying the  comfort of your own toilet.  Plus, the Squatty Potty is for everyone.  Not only those with problems, I recommend it for the entire family. 
[01:25:00]  In fact, my family uses it.  Just in time for summer, buy two and get free delivery, plus use code OP, and receive a free  bottle of Sweet Lou Deodorizer, a $10 value.

And I'm Bill Bratton, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department.  MOPD works to assure that people with disabilities can enjoy the rich opportunities our city has 
[01:25:30]  to offer.  This includes the freedom to travel throughout New York City, a right most of us take for  granted.  For people with disabilities, traveling around the city can become a challenge when drivers  fail to follow basic parking rules.  New York City's parking regulations protect the rights of people with disabilities.  When you violate parking regulations, you not only violate the law, you violate the rights  of others.  Parking spaces designated for people with disabilities ensure equal access to goods and services.  Parking without a permit in a designated space or using a fake permit is illegal. 
[01:26:00]  Any car parked illegally in a space designated for a person with disabilities will be ticketed  and subject to tow.  The fine is $180.  So do the right thing and save yourself money and hassle.  Respect the right of every New Yorker to accessible transportation.  Be honest, will owning a bigger TV help you get ahead in life?

[01:32:00]  Opie and Anthony have been creating broadcasting magic for 20 years.  Doug from the O&A Vaults.  This is a 20th anniversary O&A Radio Gem.  We got a long table over there.  Way over there.  We got Big A sitting across from Sandy Kane.  We got Twitchell sitting across from Tippy Tom.  And we got Papa Rock sitting across from Francine.  And we're going to do something called the, what, $10,000 homeless pyramid.  All right.  You give the clues.  And the guy has to come up with the word. 
[01:32:30]  Yep.  But you can't use the word.  Right.  And the clues, or else, you know, you get this.  Or something like that.  All right.  Yeah, Papa Rock is going to have Francine say what's on the paper.  All right.  We're writing down the clue.  All right.  We're writing down the clue.  And you're going to have 30 seconds.  We finally, I got the bed in front of me here.  You got 30 seconds, Papa Rock, to make Francine say what's on the paper, okay?  He's thinking.  All right.  What is it?  Whisper it to everybody, Jimmy, out there in Radio Land.  Things on a plane. 
[01:33:00]  You didn't hear that, did you, Francine?  I didn't guess that one.  Things on a plane.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's Papa Rock.  Go.  Stewardess.  What?  Aeroplane.  Things on a plane.  Oh, wait a minute.  But it wasn't you.  He's giving the clues.  He's talking right to Papa Rock.  He's giving the clues.  I'll give you the clues. 
[01:33:30]  Francine gets closed.  I'm saying, a plane.  Not things on a plane.  She goes, a plane.  And then Papa Rock goes, things on a plane.  Like he won.  But he's the guy giving the clues.  He's not even part of that team.  Good one.  I think I'm playing.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, this is John Valby.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Guy.  Hey, folks.  This is Mark Maron.  Hey, this is comedian Nick DiPoli.  What's up?  This is Joe Rogan.  You are listening to the Opie and Anthony Show, my favorite show in the history of the fucking  universe. 
[01:34:00]  Jack White.  Ah.  Doing very well.  Number one.  Latest album debuts at number one.  And Smash's first week vinyl sales record set by Pearl Jam? 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  What?  How many do you sell?  120?  Vinyl, huh?  He put out this ridiculous vinyl version.  A lot of people are trying to do the vinyl thing.  Hipsters are.  He's got a vinyl store, though, and a press and a label.  Of course he does.  He's the king of vinyl.  What a guy.  I like hearing him.  You don't miss vinyl?  Ah, vinyl schminel.  No, it's a softer set.  Shut up.  You can't tell.  It sounds great. 
[01:35:00]  You really can hear it.  Right.  Every note.  You know, it's like, I like that hissing and popping.  Yeah, it's called tinnitus.  When I listen to something, I don't want to hear that anymore.  You don't think it's a warmer sound?  No.  No.  Let me tell you.  Yeah, I got my phone.  Music's on it.  You play it.  It sounds great.  Yeah.  You don't have to have a fucking record player.  I've never been on an iPod and said, God, I wish this was on a record that would skip.  Right.  You're not an audiophile?  Oh, no.  Not that. 
[01:35:30]  Exactly.  Now, if we're talking about bike pedals.  There's a, I'm sorry, there's a kiss song called Flaming Youth.  And I remember still when I hear where it skipped when I was a kid.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I can still hear that fucking skip that I heard when I was eight years old.  It never leaves your head.  Yeah, that's true.  Remember, you'd be at a party and the records would skip because everyone's jumping around.  Or it would hit the end and go.  Right.  Right.  Well, that's if you fell asleep.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  What do you got on this, Travis?  The vinyl edition of this album is amazing.  He did such crap.  You got to hear Jack White explaining it.  Why is it amazing?  You got to hear him explain it.  It plays, yeah.  Oh, God.  Listen to this.  Listen to this musical babble.  And let me just point out that.  99.9% of the laymen won't even know.  Let me just point out that vinyl is the only form of music that is increasing in sales.  In your face!  Well, you know what?  In your face!  Are you buying vinyl?  What's the percentage?  Here it is.  Here it is. 
[01:36:30]  Four people bought vinyl last year.  Eight people bought it this year.  It's a 100% increase.  It's the fastest growing music fucking thing.  It's all 40,000 copies.  That's nothing.  That's a lot.  Most people couldn't do that, though.  His fan base will buy it.  Most people don't do that in digital sales.  But you don't think Jack White is Jack White.  It's a little bit different.  Right.  Hipsters love fucking, like, vinyl.  I got a Victrola.  Look, you crank the handle.  And then I'll wear my pirate hat.  Aside from listening to vinyl, it's fun to collect. 
[01:37:00]  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  It's big and bulky.  It sits on the floor.  I want a clockwork orange bedroom.  Just a snake and a Christ poster and a fucking...  Hopefully the sun hits and it ends up looking like ribbon candy.  You got milk carts?  Stupid melty albums.  I have Ikea carts.  Oh.  Remember when you'd steal milk carts for your records?  Oh, yeah.  You gotta put them in there.  Go behind a supermarket or something and grab some milk carts.  Are the Ikea carts specifically made for vinyl records?  No, but everybody uses them.  That's right.  The DJs used to use milk crates when they'd bring in all their shit. 
[01:37:30]  Why am I saying milk carts?  Milk crates.  Sorry.  Milk crates, of course.  And they'd have to bring in, like, fucking hand trucks full and put real albums on.  That's when, you know, it wasn't like DJ Who Kid just hitting one button.  I had vinyl for years.  You know who's really loving vinyl?  People who didn't fucking necessarily grow up with it and have no other options.  I had nothing but vinyl.  And it's like, hipsters are fine, but they're like a lot of times they have kids with money  trying to act like they're poor.  So they're just trying to act like, well, this is just this organic thing that we're doing. 
[01:38:00]  You know what I fucking love?  No.  The other night, I was watching a 13-inch cathode ray black-and-white television.  Nice.  I was watching some HD movies on it.  Fantastic.  All letterboxed on a small black-and-white screen.  And the speaker, that one little three-inch speaker in the front, just amazing.  It's better than surround sound.  Shut your face.  The things.  You might be sounding like an old man.  No.  Why?  Why you?  Because the kids are digging the vinyl. 
[01:38:30]  The things that Jack White did with this vinyl record are impossible to do with any other  medium.  What are they doing?  All right, let's find out.  God.  It spins around, you put a needle in there.  Exactly.  No, no, no, no, no.  But, all right, so look, here's the vinyl.  First of all, it's got a flat edge.  Can I see it, Sam?  I make a flat edge of it, which normally is pointy.  This is flat.  It's like the old 78s, uh, flat edge.  So, right there, already.  It has a flat edge.  All right, you're starting.  Holy fuck.  I think I'm fucking eight feet of closet space with stuff.  That's one thing.  That's one.  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:39:00]  The flat edge.  Like the old 78s.  Instead of rounded.  That was missing.  You heard him say that?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  The hipsters will be telling each other that, too.  Look at the 78.  You know, dude, dude, look at the flat edge.  Oh, wait, I can't see it.  My dumb hipster hat brim is in my eye.  Let me lift that up.  I love that you think only hipsters are listening to vinyl.  Yes, we do.  They are.  You're a hipster.  It's pretty obvious.  I couldn't be less of one.  You are a hipster.  If hipster meant gay.  Speaking of.  Hi, Sal.  Look who just came in. 
[01:39:30]  Sal thought we were talking about gay stuff.  Sal, you like your vinyl?  I love vinyl.  Oh, of course you do.  Sal, I'm fighting for vinyl here.  Come on.  Oh, man.  Why do you like vinyl?  If you're a collector, and if you...  Vinyl's fun to collect.  Vinyl's awesome.  The only vinyl you should own is the gimp suit.  By the way, that microphone sucks a dick, so...  It's sort of the guy using it.  Try that one.  Go ahead. 
[01:40:00]  Shit.  Much better?  A little more?  Just eat it.  All right.  Yeah, there you go.  Get closer.  For real, get closer.  I love collecting colored vinyl.  Oh, hey, hey.  They don't call it that anymore.  Exactly.  I mean, they're just different artists.  I was actually thinking about you guys the other day.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh.  Eyes shut in bed, curled toes naked in a sleeping bag.  Eight fingers in your asshole and cranking your dick with the other two like a velociraptor.  Eight fingers. 
[01:40:30]  Hello, and Sal tries to get a story out.  Oh, shit.  No one cares.  I apologize.  I bought a vinyl.  You don't love vinyl.  You think it's just cool.  No, I have like a very hi-fi audio system.  Who cares?  Where'd you buy it?  Where'd you buy it at a...  Oh, God.  It was a stereo world.  Was it Bucks stereo?  Bucks super stereo world?  Yeah.  Listen to that bass.  It's kicking.  That's high fidelity.  High fidelity.  That's right.  The guy came in and installed it.  He had brains on his suit. 
[01:41:00]  If you listen to vinyl on like those small little bookshelf speakers, they're pieces of shit.  But if you listen to it on like an acoustically treated room...  Is it better than your treated room?  Yeah.  Is it better than headphones?  Yeah, it's really amazing.  Give me some Bose headphones.  You can have your room treated acoustically.  I'll just jack off and fucking have Bose headphones on.  Hey, look.  It's a very common thing to actually get like a really high-end record player and get like really high-end headphones and people just...  Oh, who cares?  That's just a way of indulging in music.  Indulging.  It does sound different, yes. 
[01:41:30]  But if you're listening to it on a shit system in a fucking apartment, it sounds like Gart.  Oh, man.  I want to go to someone's house and hear...  I do want to hear it.  You would love it.  You would love it.  I grew up with records, so it's not like it's a foreign thing.  I do like the record sound, but it's a fucking pain in the ass.  Yeah, I used to listen to Destroyer.  I would go like up to my parents' attic and they had Destroyer.  Oh, you're trying to relate.  You're fucking...  I used to listen to...  I nicknamed my cop.  Let me just pull out...  Oh, you're trying to relate to...  Oh, man.  You're trying to drag Jimmy into your world. 
[01:42:00]  And it worked.  You know, Flaming Youth was on Destroyer.  That's awful.  Ew.  And me and my kiss buddy are talking.  And to relate even one more to you guys is I bought a record and this company saw, you  know, I was like, oh, okay.  I bought a bunch of records and they're like, oh, I'll send you a few extra ones because  obviously the sales aren't that good or whatever.  It's like you cost a penny and then...  You get ten of them.  And then...  No, actually, vinyl's very expensive.  It could be from like $40 to, you know, $300 for a record.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:42:30]  That's $40 for a record.  $40, yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, I just bought Pearl Jam's 10 on Coke Bottle Clear Vinyl.  Oh, no.  And that was $35.  What's Coke Bottle Clear Vinyl?  It looks like, you know, the clear Coke bottles.  Okay.  That's the color of the record.  It's probably because they don't make as many as they used to, so in order to cover the  distribution and stuff...  Yeah, like the one that I bought was $2,000.  And you usually have to remaster, too, for vinyl, because records now they're mastered  too loud.  It would literally jump the needle off the record.  You're not explaining it.  It sounds like a major hassle.  I actually got...  You have to learn and you have to plug it in and you have to figure everything out. 
[01:43:00]  What a chore to fucking listen to something that you enjoy.  I got Frog Stomp.  They sent me Frog Stomp on vinyl.  It was a double LP and it was blue.  It was so fucking cool.  What's Frog Stomp?  Maybe it's a silver chair.  Uh-huh.  Oh, is that how you were trying to relate to me?  I have a silver chair now.  You guys might remember a silver chair.  No, he said it, though.  He goes, well, you might be...  You guys were talking about it the other day.  And I said, yeah, it reminded me of the vinyl that you guys do. 
[01:43:30]  Let's hear some silver chair.  Jack White is saying about the vinyl, though.  He's selling me.  No.  Tomorrow.  Terrible.  It's mechanical.  I don't like mechanical anymore.  It's 2014.  You don't need the arms swinging.  Oh, yeah.  We lived through that.  I'm on my way.  I'm here to stay.  I'm going Hollywood.  We fucking...  We lived through vinyl.  And then when CDs came about, we were so happy. 
[01:44:00]  Yes.  Right?  And at first, they even admitted that it's not going to sound as good as vinyl, but the  convenience of it is great.  And then, you know, then the CDs did start sounding pretty good.  Oh, hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Hello, my world-time girl.  Send me a gift by wire.  Baby, my heart's on fire.  If you repeat.  If you repeat.  If you repeat.  If you repeat.  Fuck that shit.  It was a good day when you could throw all your vinyl away, and now your record collection 
[01:44:30]  reduced in size drastically.  And then you threw all the CD covers away and just had the CDs in your fucking CD book.  And then those, goodbye!  Right.  You could carry everything into your car.  It was awesome.  Digital delivery.  By a really nice iPod dock.  Digital rules.  Digital rules.  Digital absolute rules for convenience.  But if you want to have a different listening experience.  But if you want to be cool like me.  I'm not saying it's cool.  I enjoy it.  Analog, man. 
[01:45:00]  That's where it's at.  You know what I love?  I watched a movie the other night on my VHS VCR.  It's so fun hitting the tracking.  It's fun.  Making sure the tracking is right.  Oh, God.  You don't know fun until you pull out a VCR tape and it ate the tape.  Right, guys?  Right?  I would bet money that you wouldn't even be able to tell the difference between vinyl and a CD.  I would bet money.  I would bet money.  You guys could.  Absolutely.  Oh, shit.  You guys could.  Would we have to go into your, what was it? 
[01:45:30]  Your room?  His acoustically sound-changer room.  Musically.  Oh, God.  Whatever.  With the walls.  They're insulated with jizz.  And you joke about VHS.  Yeah.  But there are companies that are re-releasing old horror movies on VHS.  On VHS.  Why?  Why are they doing that?  It was this whole retro, yeah.  Limited edition blue VHS tape.  Wow.  That'd be great.  I'll tell you what it is.  VHS tape.  A lot of younger people who've never had that stuff, everything's been digital, so it's  all this small, nothing tangible. 
[01:46:00]  Enjoy what you've got.  So now they want to hold these fucking big things.  The cassettes are starting a little comeback as well.  I understand the retro angle to it, but it's a major hassle.  Do you know how nice it is to go into your vehicle, plug your fucking USB into your phone,  and there's your music.  Well, yeah, nobody's bringing vinyl into their vehicle.  Exactly.  I am.  Or we have a little 45 player between the seats.  Yes.  I completely agree.  A close and play.  Convenience digital is where it's at.  But if you just want to, like, please relax, chill out a little bit, throw on your favorite 
[01:46:30]  record.  Think of your favorite record.  I don't care.  I'm listening to you for this.  Right.  Enough already.  Yeah.  Can you walk softly around my house?  We've got a vinyl record on right now.  Don't be jumping.  Don't move.  All right.  Toby, take your shoes off.  We're all going to put slippers on.  Right.  And you're going to have an urge to dance, but please don't do that.  What about collecting?  What about, like, a collecting angle?  Like, just collecting things that you really do.  Collecting is stupid. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Collecting is pretty lame.  I bailed on collecting after baseball cards.  It's dumb.  It's a dumb thing to do in the end.  Baseball cards.  It takes up way too much space in your house.  Do you know how many baseball cards I threw away when I moved a couple months ago?  Three?  Because they're worth less than pennies.  I threw away almost 10,000 baseball cards.  Oh, man.  All Honus Wagners.  Did you chuck them?  I made sure that I got the ones that might be worth something.  I spent days going through them.  Bob Apodeca.  Ever since fucking the guy was on TV doing that whole, hey, limited edition rookie car. 
[01:47:30]  He flooded the market with cards.  I grew up in the 90s when it just got completely flooded.  Iraq, comment?  I'm going to bring up something about collecting.  Not me, though.  Scott Shannon told me about...  Hey, nigga, kids.  Wrap me up.  He has this custom room in his house that's just vinyl and 45s that he's collected through  his entire career.  Those are originals.  That's kind of cool, I guess.  He's a music guy.  And he's probably had to let him actually sign it when he interviewed him. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  That might be worth having.  Right.  So let me finish.  Oh!  So he has all this vinyl.  He gets back from Italy right away.  He's proud to teach this kid some fucking manners.  Apparently he joined the mafia group while he was over there.  Go home and get your fucking squatty potty.  Oh, they're going to be happy.  The squatty potty people.  Go ahead, Iraq.  So he has this room of all this vinyl stuff and he uses it time to time on the air.  And I said, so when you're done and you retire, you have all this stuff, what are you going 
[01:48:30]  to do with it?  He can't wait to get rid of that stuff fast enough.  So why doesn't he?  Because he's got most of it digitized and the stuff that never was digitized, he has a  guy doing like old blues records and things like that.  I don't need that stuff.  He likes having it and he goes, well, what am I going to do with this once I'm done?  I wish something would happen.  Like maybe, maybe a storm coming and a tree would fall on the house and then on the room  that all had all this stuff in it would have a tree on it.  I got a tree on my house.  Man, people are pissed off at Sal because you've added nothing to the conversation. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, Sal.  Like Travis had this and then you had to butt in and you've added nothing according to a  lot of people.  Travis knows it too.  The whole time he was giving me these like, what the fuck?  He's like, I had him on the ropes.  And it absolutely is a hipster thing.  I'm not saying you're a hipster and not everyone, but the majority.  Hold on.  Let me get Scott in Virginia because he's really mad that Sal's not like selling this problem.  Go ahead, Scott.  Just get to your point. 
[01:49:30]  One thing about this album as the needle, one of the songs on the album, the needle goes  in and then the needle goes back on the same song.  You got to let Jack White explain his whole thing.  Don't.  What?  Point number two.  If we're to label it.  All right.  I'm hanging up.  Don't let this weirdo.  He's going to spurl it.  We want to hear Jack White.  Because this started with Jack White on Jimmy Fallon explaining why vinyl is so cool.  And so far, all we got is that it's a flat edge now.  It's flat around the whole circumference. 
[01:50:00]  Kind of like the old 78s.  Yes.  See, most records, rounded edges.  Yeah.  Jack White goes, fuck that.  Fuck rounded edges.  That's exactly right.  All right, let's go.  That's rounded edges fucking with you.  All right, so look.  Here's the vinyl.  First of all, it's got a flat edge to it, which normally it's pointy.  This is flat.  It's like the old 78s flat edge.  Yeah.  And it's 180 grams.  Right.  One side is glossy and the other side is matte finish. 
[01:50:30]  You can't get that shit on a CD.  Who cares?  Glossy.  So far, it's cheap.  Who cares?  Every CD is kind of heavy.  180 gram, which is...  That's the heavy.  That's a nice weight to it.  Right.  It's dope.  It's not cheap.  It's a thick, heavy thing to carry around.  Like an old school 78, which they were very heavy.  Right.  And not many people know, around the circumference, flat edge.  Right.  Do you know, those are perfect.  We used to play record player holder when I was a kid, where you lay on your stomach and  see how many records you could fit in the groove of your asshole. 
[01:51:00]  What, do you have the Library of Congress in that?  You're a big asshole.  I know.  I understand.  A lot of big schools.  I don't disagree.  Seriously, though.  Try to ask you.  What is there?  Is it matte or glossy?  I guess one side is matte.  The other side, glossy.  All right.  Keep going.  That's the glossy side, and then the other side is matte finish.  Oh, God.  It looks the same on TV.  I mean, and then, this is the thing that's crazy.  See the label right here, guys?  Yeah, on the middle.  That's actually a song.  Yeah.  What?  You can put the needle right on the paper of the record, and it will play through the 
[01:51:30]  paper.  Who cares?  That's kind of a novel thing, though.  Holy shit.  It's just something different.  It's just like a hidden track on an album.  But on the label.  What song is on the paper?  Probably the hit song?  Paper song.  Huh?  The paper song.  The paper song.  Is it called the paper song?  Yeah.  That's right.  I actually, I've heard this.  It's a song called, You're Coming Close to the End of the Record.  That sounds great.  It sounds like Jack White, too.  All right. 
[01:52:00]  I like that you did an air guitar.  Yes, I did.  That's how I do it.  And there was no guitar.  Oh, no.  All right.  Keep going.  Tom Papa.  Tom Papa.  We're talking about vinyl records.  Vinyl, and how the hipsters love it.  And the hipsters love it.  And this dope over here.  Not you, Travis.  Sal.  Because at least Travis could, like, defend vinyl records a little bit.  He's really into it.  But he doesn't know why.  Some of these douchebags, though, that didn't have vinyl when he was, like, young.  And we did. 
[01:52:30]  We understand how convenient the phone is with more albums than I ever dreamt of having as  a kid.  It's a whole record.  It's a whole record.  In my phone.  And he's like, you know the sound of vinyl.  Fuck you, the sound.  You have to set up a whole room in his apartment so he could, like, listen properly.  Oh, man.  My God.  I'm getting you.  I'm getting you.  They sell them at Urban Outfitters.  It's like they have a whole section.  It's all cool.  Of course they do. 
[01:53:00]  So my daughter just turned 12.  Ah, same.  And she asked for it.  See?  All her friends have it.  See?  12-year-old girl, Sal.  12-year-old girl.  Doesn't know anything.  So we get it.  You know, the suitcase one that holds up.  You know, we had, like, that kind of thing.  And she's so excited.  And she gets a bunch of albums.  And she takes out her favorite, like, fun.  You know, the band Fun.  Sure.  Takes out that album and puts it on.  And this is exactly what you're saying.  It's warped.  It's...  Skipping, like, words of the song.  She's like, this blows. 
[01:53:30]  Like, oh, you got a brand new record player.  But we need to put a stack of pennies on the arm.  That's what my wife said.  We should put pennies on it.  Pennies on it.  And let's not forget the sun would hit these things.  And they would warp immediately.  You had to store your albums like they were precious cigar fucking cigars.  It was in a humidor.  Yeah.  In a cave somewhere.  God forbid the sun hit it for three seconds.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  This might play well.  But you didn't hang on to it. 
[01:54:00]  Remember when your favorite vinyl, like, did get warped?  You're like, fuck.  Fuck, man.  And then you'd heat it up and try to flatten it out.  But it would always just...  It really would fuck it up.  But Jack White is explaining the new vinyl record.  And why it rules.  And there's a song on the paper part.  So far we've found out that, number one,  it's a heavier vinyl than most.  Oh, yeah.  Like the old 78s.  Number two.  That's before our time.  One side is glossy.  One side is matte.  Matte.  So that's a plus right there.  I hated when I would get a matte one. 
[01:54:30]  I know.  Just matte on both sides.  Put your album in front of your front door.  Just a matte.  Good.  But number three.  Boo.  The circumference of the record is flat  instead of that rounded off edge  that we're so used to.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So far, he's really selling these.  But this is a big...  There's a song on the paper.  I will say,  and I hate to be a different guy,  the only one who has made me possibly  want to hear a record is Sal 
[01:55:00]  because he was talking about  that acoustic room.  I'm like, maybe that would actually sound good  just to listen to it.  Oh, you need a whole room.  You have to buy a room full of shit.  I'm not saying I'm going to do it.  I just want to try it.  A lot of these people listening to records  in a fucking kitchen,  which is the most acoustically horrible room  you could possibly think of,  if you have a record player  that costs $200,000  and you're listening on  half a million dollar speakers  with amps...  Half a million dollars?  You can hire the fans that much.  Yes, where are you?  Have Jack White stand in your hutch  and play them.  Oh, God.  Or a million dollar speaker  and just plug your iPhone 
[01:55:30]  into a room full of shit.  Yes!  It would sound awesome.  Yeah, your iPhone would sound  just as good through great shit.  Take $300,000  and buy better ears.  Let's get back to the Jack White thing.  I want to learn about the new vinyl.  So the label plays the song,  but I'm sure the quality isn't that good.  The reason that you buy vinyl  is because it's fun.  That's it.  So they put grooves on the paper  and like when you used to get  a record in a magazine or something.  On the paper?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  You walk by the record player 
[01:56:00]  and go,  oh, it's playing...  It's playing on the paper!  Oh, it's playing on the paper?  Hey, wait a minute!  It's coming over by now!  And everyone's laughing.  I know!  It's great!  And look at the edge!  It's flat!  You invite your buddy over  and you go,  oh, could you flip the record  as it's getting close to the paper?  Which side?  Gloss or Matt?  But you go,  not yet!  And a new song comes out.  Plays on the paper.  We get to the end of this fucking thing.  That's not...  What's fun about that?  Getting blown is fun.  Yeah, right.  That's not fun.  I'm sure it's good for the stylus, too, 
[01:56:30]  that it's playing on the paper.  Just eating away your stylus.  Is that really paper, though,  or is that just blue mat?  No, it's paper.  Who cares?  Could we play the rest of this clip?  See what else?  This is great.  Before we get Sal out of here.  And then, this is the thing that's crazy.  See the label right here, guys?  Yeah.  That's actually a song.  Wow.  You can put the needle  right on the paper of the record  and it will play through the paper.  And they're like,  amazed!  They're amazed!  They're amazed!  This is yelling like a caveman  just saw fire. 
[01:57:00]  This is the same audience  that loves watching Pictionary  with celebrities.  Yeah.  Exactly.  We now can make fucking human cells  in a 3D printer.  I don't find this to be technological.  I remember pulling out a record  on the back of a Mad magazine.  It was cardboard.  That was the best.  You ripped it out  and you put it on  and you say that.  And then you played it.  It's no big fucking deal.  That's true.  Of a cereal box you would get it.  Yes, a cereal box  is another thing.  I know what song it was. 
[01:57:30]  Mad magazine did have  a weird record.  I know what song it was.  It was plastic.  Oh, yeah.  You feel this, Ant.  Listen to the fidelity.  It's great, right?  A lot of last bass.  It's really kicking.  It's so different than other music.  It sounds warm.  Yes.  It's totally different music.  Like me.  Like me.  See, this on an iPad  or on an iPhone  would just sound like shit.  That's terrible. 
[01:58:00]  You lose all the humor.  You don't get that nice  warm analog wave sound.  You get that stiff  digital steps.  Shut it.  Your ear doesn't even notice.  Back to Jack White, please.  Let's learn some more about this.  We're sucked into the grooves  of the record  and you can actually  hear the songs too.  Wow.  I think that is...  It has so many tricks.  They're applauding.  What tricks do you do on this?  There's a hidden...  There's a...  I know, it's so fun.  That's nice. 
[01:58:30]  Thank God, Jack White.  What?  There's a hidden...  There's a hidden...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He's the 8,000th person  to do that on the Tonight Show.  Right.  The fake leave.  First started by, I think,  Bob Hope.  Good night, everybody.  Hey, I gotta leave.  My eyes are bleeding.  You can play it on the paper.  Hey, it's great.  I've never done the fake leave.  They've done the fake booking.  When I get there,  they're like,  what are you doing? 
[01:59:00]  Did you see LOL  at the end of the email?  I don't see an LOL.  Let's look again, sir.  All right.  Keep going.  Jesus Christ.  What did you got?  You have a hidden track  that's a 78 track.  And then this...  The side one starts on the inside.  You put the needle on the inside  and it goes out.  Whoa!  Which is nostalgic.  But it's also the first...  It goes the other way.  Yeah, we heard him.  Watching Fallon's reactions  are hilarious.  How does...  I know, he's just freaking out. 
[01:59:30]  What?  This is freaking...  He's freaking out.  I have to hold the sides of my head  or it's gonna explode.  He's the nicest guy alive.  He really is.  He really is fun.  He just loves everybody.  He just loves everything  and everybody.  Now, here's what I don't understand.  It's just a maze.  What's that?  I don't think  your record player needle...  It'll go with the grooves.  I'm trying to think.  Okay, so it's spinning...  Same rotation.  It's got to spin  in the same rotation.  Right. 
[02:00:00]  But it's going the other way.  All right, so it goes down.  What happens when it gets to the end?  Like a record player,  when it gets to the end,  it knows that the arm comes up  like a crane.  There's gears and mechanics in there.  Well, maybe he's going to explain it.  Oh!  If Fallon was smart,  he would say,  wait a minute,  wouldn't the needle just fall off  at the end?  Yeah.  He's too excited.  Jack White looks like a woman  from 1920.  What a fucking...  Nucky Thompson's, girls.  He should have a giant, 
[02:00:30]  hairy pussy  as he's talking about this.  Sorry, Sam.  I know that.  Sam's a giant,  hairy pussy.  I love Jack White, too.  Love the Jack White,  but this is just nonsense.  Yeah, this is nonsense.  It's, like, insane.  It's also the first vinyl record  to have an etched hologram,  a metal etching hologram  with an angel spinning.  You'd have to spin the record  to show it on a turntable.  Oh, right.  But, I mean,  so right here,  you can't see it,  but I was going to ask you,  this looks just like scratching.  Yeah, this artist, 
[02:01:00]  Tristan Duke,  he did metal etching.  I don't know how he does it,  but he makes a hologram.  He might be able  to catch a glimpse of it,  but you'd have to spin it  on a turntable.  Maybe they'll cut the commercial  and they'll show it later.  You can film it or something.  Yeah, maybe we'll film it, yeah.  It's fucking awesome.  I'd have a fucking devil.  All right.  Keep going, keep going.  Jimmy Fallon's acting like  a kid that came over the house  and you're showing him  shit like this,  but he's really high.  So it's amazing to him.  It's all right.  Yeah, yeah.  No way.  Jimmy Fallon is showing you  why he got the Tonight Show.  Right.  Because he can take something  like that anyone else  would look at and go,  who gives a fuck? 
[02:01:30]  Right.  But he's actually making it seem  like it's this amazing,  interesting thing.  Oh, my God.  This is awesome.  So artists will be like,  hey, this guy's great.  I'm going to go on this show.  It's so funny.  When you were a kid,  the most disinteresting part  of albums was looking at it.  It was the album itself.  Right.  Everything else is good.  The cover, the sleeve,  the jacket, the liner notes,  the fucking music  that came out of it.  The album itself was shit.  You never stared  at the studio record.  Look at that.  But now you have to.  Now you have to.  To see it playing  the opposite way.  And the hologram. 
[02:02:00]  Going backwards.  That's exciting  for maybe five seconds.  And then you're like,  okay, what do you got to eat?  Why does it sound so shit?  Exactly.  We're only halfway done  with this.  There's so much more.  You want to see  what else comes out.  There's a lot of features.  We'll give you  some really good ones too.  All right, let's see.  Let's see.  Wait till you hear  about the hidden tracks.  It's kind of insane  that you went to  all this length  just to make  such a fun, cool thing.  There's another track  that it depends,  the song changes  depending on 
[02:02:30]  where you drop the needle.  That's right.  It's the first,  I think,  that's been done too  on one side.  This is so fun.  Come on, Jimmy.  It's nice.  He just said,  I got to get a record player.  So he's not even  a vinyl guy.  He's flipping out.  But is he fucking around?  That's the beauty of Pharoah.  Sometimes you don't know  if he's just fucking around.  He's probably a big  Jack White fan.  Yeah, I think he's  just a big Jack White fan.  He knows that Jack White  has created another  work of genius.  So there's two separate  spirals of grooves 
[02:03:00]  in one song  so that if you  move the needle a little  it goes into  a whole other track.  That's cool.  I will say,  at least Jack White  did something different.  He's trying.  Yeah, he's trying  to do something  kind of interesting.  But how do you find  the start of these songs?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  You might have had  some of the old  Monty Python records.  Absolutely.  They had one called  Matching Tie and Handkerchief  and that was two different grooves.  It was called  a three-sided album.  That's right.  It was two different grooves  on one side  next to each other.  Well, we did that  in the first song.  here, but that was  actually two different  parts of a song 
[02:03:30]  and they come together  into one groove  and finish the song.  And that hadn't  been done before.  And then also,  is this the first record  that is 33,  some songs are 45  and some are 78?  That's right.  And it also makes  pizza and dry pizza.  That's good.  You've got to pay  attention to what  the fuck's speed  while you're stoned  on your couch.  He said it also  makes pizza  and dry cleaning.  No, it doesn't.  It does?  Oh, Chip.  Does it?  Literal Chip.  Just kidding, Chip.  Why would that be fun 
[02:04:00]  that it's 33, 45, and 78?  Don't you want to have  to get up and change it?  Because it's like...  A lot of people  cursing out Jack White.  Why?  Because you want to  just hang out  like Ann said  and next thing you know  your record  is in fast fucking motion.  That's great.  It's an experience.  You're fucking trying  to listen to the music  you're fucking laying  on the bed  all of a sudden  it speeds up  your girlfriend's  going to get up  and towel off  the strap on  and change the speed. 
[02:04:30]  You like getting  a rhythm going  and then it goes  in a 78  and you're fucking...  Sure.  I'm excited for them  to bring back  the Discman.  Yeah, that's...  That was a cool thing  to work out with.  Walking like  you have a platter  so it wouldn't skip.  It's not buffering  long enough.  Ah, the buffering.  Putting on the  not skip button.  Right, right.  I like nice...  I like to make love  to vinyl.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, draw on a little  lead belly  and make love to vinyl. 
[02:05:00]  Yuck.  Keep going.  Oh, my God.  There's more to this.  There's so much more.  Oh, Christ.  We only got ten more  in stock.  I'm talking to everyone  right now.  We got ten more.  We got to go.  Congrats on this thing.  And this is...  I was looking at  the liner notes  and I was listening to the...  This is water, right?  That is...  And the cover itself  can be used  to clean your pot seats.  That was everyone.  I was listening to  the record today.  It sounds great.  There's all sorts  of different sounds. 
[02:05:30]  Like crazy good rock,  crazy guitar songs,  a country jam on there.  It's good.  And then I was reading  the liner notes  and I was reading  your thank yous  in particular.  And it kind of made me laugh.  You thank food  for one of your things.  It starts going off  in different tangents.  That's another thing.  Fun liner notes.  All right.  Keep going.  Sam's got his name  tattooed on his arm  so he loves him.  Jimmy Fallon.  He does.  Yeah, Jimmy Fallon.  I saw up-and-coming 
[02:06:00]  songwriters.  Hold on, Paul.  They're not up-and-coming,  never established.  Oh, God.  Chip.  Joke.  Chip.  Fuck.  Kidding.  Another.  Damn.  They're kind of done  talking about the record.  Yeah, yeah.  They might not be.  What if there's another thing?  What if there's another piece?  Keep going.  I haven't heard of  Paul Simon and Bob Dylan.  And also,  all the lyrics, 
[02:06:30]  I was looking at that  and then I was researching.  It said that  I saw you say somewhere  that you kind of  co-wrote these songs.  You wrote the songs  with yourself.  This is songs you wrote  another record-breaking thing.  Way, way, way.  With a 19-year-old  Jack White.  Yeah.  Well, I worked a long time  in the circle.  I usually make records  in a couple weeks.  I tried to make them  in a couple weeks,  but this I worked  for about a year and a half.  Am I trying to have  a conversation with this guy?  We did.  I mean, like...  We did have a conversation  with a guy.  He's really strange.  He's a weird guy.  It wasn't one of our  better interviews, 
[02:07:00]  that's for sure.  He's just a weird guy.  What am I doing?  It's like another one  was like...  Perry Farrell.  Perry was awesome.  He was another one  that was impossible  to have a conversation with.  Because he talks about  spaceships and aliens.  You're a weirdo.  You're just a weird...  We're going to do a concert  where we're just going to  talk to aliens  and the sky will open up.  What the fuck?  Sorry that you guys  can't relate to artists.  Ah!  That must be it.  Wow, Sam.  That must be it.  Keep going.  Please.  ...songs that I didn't 
[02:07:30]  write vocals for  for eight or nine months  on some of those songs.  So I was getting to the point  where I was going  to have to start  writing vocals for them.  I thought,  I'm so detached now.  It's almost like  I'm working with  someone else's music now.  It's been so long.  And I just found  I was cleaning out  some things in the attic  and I found some writings  I did when I was 19  which is about  half my age now.  And they weren't very good.  They were just sort of writings  like one-act plays  and poems and things.  And I just pulled  a couple characters out of them  and I thought,  what if I teach myself  how to write a song  as a 19-year-old? 
[02:08:00]  If I had had my older self  to talk to me right now,  how would I tell myself  how to write a song?  He would just smack you  on the face  for being such a douche.  This is why I tell  the same jokes  over and over for 20 years.  ...passion to your records  and you can tell  when you guys hear  what he plays tonight.  Jack White's new record,  Lazaretto.  Yeah, his shit is really good.  Bravo.  Bravo.  I like his shit.  Bravo.  On vinyl.  He's fucking brilliant.  He is.  Whatever process  it takes to get there,  it's worth it.  He's brilliant.  For real.  He is.  And the albums, 
[02:08:30]  you know,  hey, look,  don't you,  I still have,  my parents still have  a box of albums  that I couldn't throw away.  Really?  Yeah.  They had  Wings Over America  and Pink Floyd's The Wall.  But why are they  still at your parents' house?  Because it's where  all my antique artifacts are.  It's a trophy  from wrestling  that one year.  Yes, it is.  It's the Tom Papa Museum.  Ladies and gentlemen,  welcome to the Tom Papa Museum.  It's my time capsule. 
[02:09:00]  God,  when we moved out  of my parents' house,  they gave up our rooms  to, like,  tenants immediately  and got rid of all our shit.  Well, it's not displayed.  It's not,  my room's still not intact.  Well, some of those parents,  like,  I'm sure Sam's parents  still have a same room.  Oh, Sam's parents,  his room probably is like  when the parents  have a kid that died  and they don't open the,  they don't open it  until 20 years later  when the cold case detective  needs to look in the room.  The father,  once in a while,  on his way to bed,  will just open it  and look it up.  Sniffle, 
[02:09:30]  shut the door  and go back to bed.  Smell the pillow.  That's Sam's room.  It's such a mommy.  I have a lot of stuff  from my parents' house.  Sam Roberts Museum  is in full of pride.  We got a very mad  Jack White fan.  Fat Matt in Jersey.  Fat Matt.  Yo.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  I think we're,  listen,  just one thing is that  what if Jack White  died in a couple of years?  I think they're now,  like,  this would be worth, 
[02:10:00]  well,  a lot of money.  Oh, yeah?  What are you talking about?  It's mass-produced.  Jesus.  Yeah, but it's all  you have to be a downer  either, dude.  He sold 40,000 of them,  right?  Everybody's a downer.  We're having a few laughs.  What if Jack caught leukemia?  That's a lot.  It would be sad.  We're here laughing,  talking about a dead kid's room,  and you, you know,  fuck it all up like this.  You understand?  We'll make it real.  We're goofing around.  Yeah.  All the way to the bank.  Not Francis.  We're just goofing around.  It's a goof! 
[02:10:30]  Sam Schertz would be worth  a lot of money, too,  when he died.  Oh, man.  I'm not bringing that up.  Oh, if we're getting in,  I'll bring all that up.  All right.  Yeah.  Come on.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  You added a lot, Sal.  Thank you.  Sal, great.  I'm going to go.  And then you guys didn't even hear,  but when he was talking  about the stuff that's actually  like at least cool  in a sort of kitschy,  collectible way,  Sal's going,  well, I'm not into that shit.  You said that's cool.  I don't think this record's cool.  Very good, Sal.  This record,  this is gimmicky,  this record, honestly.  Ooh! 
[02:11:00]  Gimmicky!  That's the whole.  Oh, Jack White  has been called out.  Because he's a hipster.  So he wants traditional vinyl.  That's it.  Pioneer or techniques?  What kind of  turntable you got?  I have a technique.  A technique.  Okay.  Honestly, like,  I like vinyl sound,  but like,  and I like Jack White's music.  You don't like vinyl sound.  No one cares that much.  It's the same shit.  There's probably  a hundred people in America  that really do like vinyl sound,  and you're not one of those.  You're not.  You're so confused 
[02:11:30]  about what they're supposed  to think is cool.  Thank you.  It's such a fine line  between what's really cool,  what am I supposed to think  is cool,  what my friends accept me  for thinking is cool.  It's like being in seventh grade  when you discovered  what cool is when you first died.  You know what I'm bringing back?  The eight track.  Now that needs to come back.  Sweet home Alabama,  where the skies are so blue.  Sweet home Alabama.  Lord, I'm coming.  Yep.  In the middle of the song, 
[02:12:00]  they would have to change the track.  Clunk, clunk.  Clunk, clunk.  It sounded like  a fucking shotgun being wrecked.  It was Freebird, by the way.  Those were cool.  Yeah.  Sweet home Alabama.  They fit on a track.  It was the longer ones.  Yeah.  Because they couldn't figure out  what the different tracks like.  It never timed out equally.  Right.  For each track.  So one, you know,  you had a sacrifice.  Right.  My father had it in his car.  Oh, yeah.  My dad had one, too.  Yeah.  He listened to Boz Gags.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  My dad was Johnny Cash 
[02:12:30]  and like Kenny Rogers.  Nice.  And then we were taking a trip to...  You got to know when to hold him.  Exactly.  Clunk, clunk.  We were taking a trip to California  in a Pinto runabout.  Me, my brother, my dad,  and my dad's girlfriend at the time.  And so we stopped off at Modell's  to buy some eight tracks.  And we bought some Alice Cooper.  Nice.  Me and my brother were like,  yeah, and dad popped that in  for about three seconds.  And, well, if you're cruising 
[02:13:00]  the northern route to California,  perhaps somewhere in South Dakota,  you might find that tape  that dad threw out the fucking window.  He didn't like it.  Oh, did he not like Alice Cooper?  He didn't play it through.  What's this goddamn shit?  It's Alice Cooper, dad.  Fucking asshole.  You got to know when to hold him.  Now that's an American.  And then we go,  yeah, now this is music.  I sold the line.  I sold it.  I took my father's 8-track 
[02:13:30]  and put it in my room.  He had like this portable thing  and put it up to speak.  Wow, a bass station.  I thought it was so damn cool.  And then Zeppelin.  It just kept playing Zeppelin  over and over again.  It just sounded so awful.  But I was just so happy  to have any music in my room.  Right.  It was just gigantic.  The amount of equipment,  the amount of shit.  And then I did have speakers  in my car for a while too.  So I would just find one speaker  and wire the speaker wires together  and just leave it on the floor  of the passenger side. 
[02:14:00]  And then the magnet  would pick up like rocks.  And you realize  how much metal is on earth.  Because it all goes around  the magnet.  And then the dirt  would collect in the cone  of the speaker.  So everything...  It's the rocks.  We're vibrating on this.  I ain't giving a shit about sound.  I just wanted to hear something.  Rock and roll.  Anything but the fucking engine  that was dying.  All right, Sal.  Wonderful discussion on vinyl. 
[02:14:30]  Yes.  Yes.  What's the vinyl?  You don't know what you want.  You don't know what you want  or like it.  What vinyl does he like  if he doesn't like that?  Yeah, what vinyl do you like?  Well, a lot of modern bands  are releasing reissues  of their albums and stuff,  remastering it.  What's his face?  The guy from Train.  Don't they have a vinyl?  Oh, wow.  See what he did again?  Because we had Train in  the other day  or Pat from Train.  We like Pat and Train.  So it's like,  oh, now we can't bash this.  But he would probably 
[02:15:00]  make fun of the whole  vinyl movement.  He probably would.  If they're paying him,  I doubt it.  Oh, shit.  Whoa.  Excuse me.  He just called him a whore.  I know.  The industry is very unusual  in the sense that people  are stealing music  and stuff like that.  This is something  where actually a band  can actually have a chance  to make some money.  You're playing into it  because I know exactly  what happened.  Like these musicians  can't make money anymore  because everyone's  getting their music for free.  So they all figured out,  wait a minute,  if we try to make vinyl cool,  these kids will buy the vinyl  and we'll make some money.  Selling for $100 of an album.  But it doesn't mean it's cool.  How could you fault a band 
[02:15:30]  for trying to push their product  a little bit further  and get something,  get the fans  and get the attention  of their crowd?  But I'm not going to sit here  while you badmouth vinyl!  But you know,  all the vinyl,  all the record players,  like my daughters,  came with a USB port  so you can download it  to your iPad anyway.  And that's not  the record player  that I'm talking about.  How much did you spend  on your system?  My system?  Your stereo system.  I've allocated it  over many years.  It's a decent system.  $200,000?  No. 
[02:16:00]  $200,000.  He actually answered that.  We know it's not $200,000.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not $200,000.  Thank you, Lee.  He died answers.  How much about?  It's probably close  to like $15,000 or $20,000.  No way.  Yeah.  $20,000?  $20,000 for what?  What the fuck  costs that much?  It's the entire signal chain.  It's the record player.  And your mommy  had to pay for that.  No, it's all money  that I've reinvested  in myself  from making music  over the years.  It's $20,000.  $20,000? 
[02:16:30]  Probably, yeah.  If you take the whole  signal chain,  it's probably, yeah.  The signal chain.  The signal chain.  He's right, guys.  It's the signal chain.  Yeah, you know,  I have to agree with that.  The signal chain.  Out comes the  chocolate choo-choo train.  That is too much money.  That's just stupid.  That's the last time  we make fun of E-Rocks  for spending money.  Exactly.  You're off the hook, buddy.  Sam, no.  It's not money  that my parents gave me.  It's money  that I've reinvested  in myself.  We've heard you.  I have papers.  He's practiced that.  That's why he just said  no. 
[02:17:00]  And then you reinvest it,  Norton.  You re-reinvest it.  I gotcha.  How many albums  do you have in total?  What's that?  How many albums in total?  How many do I have?  Yeah.  Between my parents  gave me their collection,  I probably have like  three to four hundred  records, probably.  That's a lot of money  per album.  No, no.  It's like on a case.  MPA, I call it.  Money per album.  He would spend  $20,000  divided by the  300 albums  to listen to.  So each album  to play it  cost you 
[02:17:30]  a little math.  Someone do math.  300 over 20,000?  No, yeah.  About 600  and something  a piece.  600?  No.  What?  No, it's not  everywhere.  Yeah.  18,000?  Yeah, you're right.  It's just under 700.  Yeah, yeah.  It would be the easy  way to do that.  600 and something.  Yeah.  High 600s.  That seems expensive.  Very.  But it costs you  $20,000  and you don't even  listen to the vinyl 
[02:18:00]  records a lot.  You said occasionally.  Well, no.  It's incorporated  into my recording rig.  It's kind of like  a parallel.  Because you have  realized it's a  fucking hassle.  It's a pain in the ass.  So what you're  talking about is  you have a home studio.  Right.  One component  in your home studio  is your techniques  player, which plugs  into the input  of this whole thing.  Sure.  So you didn't spend  $20,000 for just that.  No, no, no.  That's why I said  single chain.  That's why I'm saying  how much did the  radiator cap cost?  It cost me $100,000.  It's on a Jaguar.  That's why I said  that's why I said  the signal chain. 
[02:18:30]  That's why I said  in the record.  He did say  single chain.  You are not getting  the signal chain.  But he didn't say  the recording studio.  And that's a component  in the recording studio.  Yeah, he just wanted  to look cool.  He wanted to make  sound like he spent  $20,000 on fucking...  Once again,  he wanted to look cool.  To stacks up.  Like, I am so fucking cool  I spent $20,000  to listen to vinyl records.  When you're holding a  Pabst Blue Ribbon  in your bar  in Brooklyn  with your retro  trucker hat.  You talk about your  signal chain.  Right.  You've got to...  You hear them say  signal chain  and you've got to  keep that going. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  It's just part of  the signal chain.  How come 45  said I made a comeback?  A little four...  I found an old  Kiss 45.  I just can't throw it out.  Uh, bands will release  just like a limited  edition single  at 45.  Sometimes they'll put  like a...  They're not limited edition.  Limited edition.  They're just trying to  get some money  from their fans.  Limited edition.  Limited edition  comes with a  Sosa Rookie card.  Right.  That shit isn't  worth anything.  Holy shit.  Limited edition  is bullshit.  Stick of gum.  Some powdery  crunchy gum.  It says limited edition 
[02:19:30]  is usually not  going to be worth  anything because  limited edition  just kind of came out  or went away.  Yeah, it's not  going to be worth  anything.  The things that are  worth stuff now  are stuff that you  never thought  would ever be  a collectible.  Right.  When they're sold  as collectibles now,  they're worthless.  Right.  Even years later.  Yep.  All right, we're  going to take a break.  Thank you, Sal.  All right, you guys.  Sal, bang up job,  my friend.  Amazing.  Signal chain.  Go signal chain  your ass out of here.

[02:31:00]  Yeah, Bosch Gags.  There you go.  My dad just driving  the Impala.  Oh, yeah.  The Impala.  Mine was the Rambler.  Just getting so nauseous  in the backseat.  Oh, right.  And the A-track  would just play  in a loop,  so this would just  keep coming,  keep coming,  keep coming.  Ah, Bosch Gags  didn't have enough songs  for a greatest hits,  really.  It was good.  I mean, 
[02:31:30]  he was definitely  quality,  but not when you're  nauseous in the backseat  and you're plaid pants  on a long trip  to a friend in Connecticut.  Did you have  brothers or sisters?  Two sisters.  Okay.  Two little sisters.  So there was a chance  that you had to sit  on the hump?  No.  I was the oldest,  so I was the leader.  Lucky you.  I would make them,  I would trick them  into thinking  that going where  your feet are,  that little dip,  was a special,  like,  compartment that you could,  so they would curl up  in there like little dogs  and I would just  stretch out on the backseat. 
[02:32:00]  Meanwhile,  down there  we'd get like a furnace.  Like,  they couldn't even figure out  how to keep the exhaust heat  out of the compartment,  the life compartment.  No,  get down there.  You guys can be doggies.  You guys can be my doggies.  That hump used to get  like fucking  a thousand degrees.  I'm getting hot.  You'd be sitting there  going,  at least you guys  had seats.  Oh boy,  you didn't have seats.  We had the Volkswagen bus.  Oh Jesus.  Then they took the seats out  so they could get  more kids in there. 
[02:32:30]  Seriously.  Smart move.  So we would hold on  to where the seatbelt's  attached to the bottom  of the,  you know,  the car there.  Oh Jesus.  You'd hold on  to the latches?  That's crazy.  Wow.  We were seven.  Seven kids  and then there were  always other kids.  Little strap hangers.  And that has no,  nothing on the turns  or anything.  No,  we didn't have,  what?  We didn't have  anti-sway.  We didn't put the,  we held on to the seatbelt.  We didn't put it on.  True story.  My brothers would  back me up big time. 
[02:33:00]  It would ever get hurt?  No.  No.  Yeah,  exactly.  No.  Yeah.  That'd be some close calls  where there was a quick  breaking and everyone  just flew forward.  You would kind of  hold on and take the  turn a little bit.  Just laugh.  I don't know why  they did that.  Maybe the seat's broken  and they just decide  not to fix them.  I don't know.  I gotta ask my mom.  Was it to get some  collectibles around  the neighborhood maybe?  Some empties or rocks?  Some empties or rocks?  It was the work truck too,  yeah.  When you think of the,  when you see like a 
[02:33:30]  micro bus,  do you feel like  you want to get that  or do you feel like  thank God?  I kind of smile.  Yeah.  It brings me back.  Yeah.  I would love a micro bus.  A micro bus?  Yeah.  Volkswagen.  My dad got into  building rock walls  so on the weekends  we would get in  the Volkswagen bus  and then he would make  he would make us think  that we're having fun.  It's like,  alright guys,  play Army in the woods.  Like Jack White  in his record.  Trying to talk into  the fact that it's fun.  But it would pull up.  It's retro from the Civil War. 
[02:34:00]  Let's build a stone wall.  This is how they used  to build things.  Yeah.  But he would find  these hills and like,  alright guys,  go play Army  and then,  oh by the way,  if you see any rocks,  roll them down the hill.  And then we realized  we're there to collect  his fucking rocks.  You didn't realize that  until ten years later.  Of course,  because we're young  and stupid.  Clever.  That sounds great though.  Taking a micro bus  into the woods.  But he allowed us  to just roll them  down the hill  which was pretty cool.  That was pretty cool.  We had to carry them down.  That's a fun thing  for kids to do.  Rolling rocks down the hill  is pretty fucking fun.  It's pretty great. 
[02:34:30]  I'll give you that.  I brought that back  a little bit  at the Grand Canyon.  Me and my brother  were throwing rocks  over the edge.  Wow,  that's pretty fucking cool.  That's pretty awesome.  As long as you know  there's no hikers  down below.  No,  that's the beauty  knowing there could be.  You would hear  these rocks  just hitting everything  on the way down  and it would just  go forever and ever.  not supposed to do that.  It's probably highly illegal  so maybe I should  shut the fuck up.  I don't think you're  supposed to screw around  with the environment.  We did one  and it was so cool  we spent about  a half hour 
[02:35:00]  just finding  nice sized rocks.  Oh man.  We had to throw  with two hands  over the side.  Those rocks  have been sitting there  like they saw dinosaurs  and then that moment  you pick to just  roll it down a hill.  And the Hughes boys  had to fucking  wreck everything.  Reliving the rock days.  The rock wall days.  This guy can confirm  what I'm talking about  with Volkswagens.  What do you mean confirm?  It's my story.  Were you in the car?  Daryl?  No.  My parents also had one  that caught fire once. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  I had three brothers  and there's a handle  right behind  the pasture site seat.  Right.  And we used to like  to stand there  and hold it.  I got shoved out of it  one day.  My brother didn't like me.  Yeah.  Oh, you just reminded me  we would stand up  a little bit  because that felt like  you were now  using your legs  like a shock absorber.  I forgot all about that.  Yes.  Now you're surfing.  Did you have the seats  in yours?  Because for some reason  my parents took ours out.  Oh, same here.  My parents had a paper route 
[02:36:00]  and they took up  too much space  and they had  big bundles of papers.  And there was  four of us  and no base setters.  Hearing the paper boy  coming.  And me and my older brother  were fighting over  that handle one day  and he told me  to get out.  Right.  I'm starting to remember  more and more.  Okay.  Because you would use it.  Don't go too far.  No, no.  God knows.  I'm sure the guy  knows what.  The Volkswagen bus,  yeah, you would use it 
[02:36:30]  for all your chores.  So I think the seats  came out easily.  Now it's starting  to come back to me.  So we would have them  on the side  when they needed  to get the rocks  or all this other shit.  And then we got  too lazy to put them  back in.  So then my mom  is like,  all right,  you guys are going  to the beach.  Just get in.  Fuck it.  That's what it was.  Okay.  Because it didn't sound  like smart to just  take them out forever.  Unbolt them.  Oh, yeah.  I like how the jobs  ended up at.  The jobs  at the micro bus  are making walls 
[02:37:00]  and paper routes.  No one's in the micro bus  on the way to Wall Street.  Unbelievable.  No, man.  You're watching  the World Cup.  I am watching  the World Cup.  I'm all in  on the World Cup.  You're there, huh?  Yeah, I am.  I was watching  yesterday a little bit.  I'm trying to get into it.  I really am.  If you have...  I'm starting to get it,  though,  because the whole world  is watching.  That part of it  is kind of cool.  Yeah.  I started doing it  just because I live  with other people. 
[02:37:30]  My wife and daughters.  And, you know,  if I turn on  the Yankee game,  it's three hours  that no one's coming  in that room  and I'm cool  and I can be by myself  because they're girls  and they're not interested.  Now the World Cup,  you're giving me  whole days.  This is going into weeks  of me turning it on  in the morning  and it just rolls all day  and they're so disinterested.  They don't want to...  And I'm sitting there  watching Cameroon  and Croatia.  I don't really care.  I was watching that.  Go Cameroon! 
[02:38:00]  But after a couple days  of pretending to like it,  now I like it.  You started liking it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, so this is new for you.  It's great.  I've always...  I always got into it  but now I'm...  I think I'm deeper.  Right.  It's great.  You guys don't like it?  You don't like it, Jimmy?  I don't hate it.  I just...  I never grow up.  I don't really...  I don't fully understand it.  Why people watch soccer.  No?  Not really.  But I mean,  the World Cup,  like I said,  knowing the whole world  is in on this,  that part of it  is really cool. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  It is really cool  and it's the drama  builds up  and then it's very colorful  and...  I'm just not into  the real lack  of the scoring  which is why  people say,  Oh, you Americans,  you need a high-scoring game.  Oh, ho, ho.  Yeah.  Oh, ho, ho.  But...  I don't know  if he's saying that  but it's an old villain.  I think there's  an undercurrent of pride  that we have  that our sports,  you actually need money  to do.  You need equipment  in football.  You need a hoop. 
[02:39:00]  It's just like...  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  All you need is a ball  and we can play.  Yeah, that's why  we're not that into it.  Yeah, that's why  we're not that into it  and that's why  there's so many countries  that are  because you just need that.  Yeah.  A lot of the impoverished  nations can play  because, you know...  We don't even have a ball.  We use a milk carton.  It's a goat head.  We kick the goat head.  And it's special  because it's their only sport  in a lot of places.  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, they play other sports  but not to that level.  Yeah.  Very...  To that interest.  You don't see a lot of  Guy... 
[02:39:30]  Guyana...  A lot of Ghana  ice hockey.  Ghana ice hockey.  Ghana NFL.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You don't see that.  Gone to baseball even.  I don't know.  I'm trying.  I'll watch...  It's good though.  I'm getting into it.  I'll watch U.S. Portugal.  That's tomorrow, right?  Yeah, that's on...  Oh, no, Saturday.  Saturday?  Sunday.  Sunday.  I know it's Sunday  because it's...  Because it's...  Most of the days  because it's...  Wow, listen to it.  I think it's Saturday.  No, because I think  I have to see my in-laws  on Sunday  and I'm worried  that it's going to be  at the same time. 
[02:40:00]  So how many more games  do the U.S. have to win  to win everything?  A lot.  Yeah, they're still  in their bracket.  They're still in the first round.  So you've got to play  everyone in your bracket  so they've got two more games  in their bracket.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  And then the best two  in that bracket move on.  You know more than me.  And then it'll be  sort of like a sweet 16  at that point.  How many rounds  are the brackets for?  There's four teams  in each bracket  and you play each team  I guess, right?  Yeah.  I believe.  Whoops, you lost me.  Yeah.  There's a lot of games.  Ah, shit.  Soccer.  They had the big first win 
[02:40:30]  and it is exciting  when you sit  and you get into it  and you're just hanging out  and it's like  it draws you in.  It definitely has  a tension  and an excitement.  I might watch the next USA.  You should.  I might watch it.  You should.  If I don't have  a root canal plan  or something,  I'll say  because I'd rather.  Yeah, it's on Sunday.  The dentist is closed.  Thank you  for that, Chip.  It's very dramatic  and they all hug  and they hold  each other's faces.  I'm so sorry.  It's very touchy-feely. 
[02:41:00]  Much more than American.  And when they kick a goal,  it's the run around the field  like you're freaking out.  You put your arms up  and run  and then you fall down.  Try and catch me, guys.  Try and catch me.  Yes, yes.  You're going to hold yourselves.  Yeah, I know.  You kick the ball  into a net.  Big fucking whoop.  Fucking very patriotic, though.  Oh, bye-bye.  A lot of patriotism.  Spagna.  Yeah, Spagna.  Spagna.  Spagna's out.  Eliminated.  And they won the last World Cup, right?  Yeah, they're gone.  See, I know a little bit about this.  I'm learning every day.  It's good stuff. 
[02:41:30]  I'm trying.  It's very dramatic  and you fall  and you're...  I realize we Americans,  we don't touch each other as much.  We never like...  No.  We never like hold each other.  Now that you're touching me,  I understand why.  It's really weird.  You have a horrible touch, Tom.  Yeah, you really do.  That was not a good touch.  Lenny pets a girl's hair in the barn.  Might be your technique.  That was like...  Just lying to me.  That was a little ghoulish.  Speaking of sports,  big story today.  The Washington Redskins.  Oh. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  cancels Redskins Trademark.  This is preposterous.  Calling it disparaging to Native Americans.  It's crazy.  It's disgusting that they do that.  It's forcing them to change their name.  This is not good people.  The government really stepping in,  forcing somebody to stop expressing...  The freedom of expression and freedom of...  So many people are praising this decision.  You don't want the government involved.  They're denying the...  They take away the trademark.  Yeah, they pulled their trademark,  so now anybody, I guess, 
[02:42:30]  can start printing up Redskins logos  and selling them on shirts or hats or something.  People on Twitter are such dummies.  I tweeted yesterday,  like, you can't make them...  I don't want the name to exist,  but you can't force them to change it.  That's not the way she...  Right.  And people are like,  this doesn't force them to change it.  It's making it tougher.  It's a step in a direction  that the government should not be taking.  Yes.  They shouldn't be involved at all.  At all in this.  At all.  That was given years and years and years ago.  Yeah.  Come on, man.  You can't...  That's...  I believe they did this,  to them back in... 
[02:43:00]  Oh, yeah, okay, 1999.  Who's behind that?  Who...  Some woman sued.  Like, an American Indian woman sued.  Most people don't care.  They've polled the people.  They don't care.  Yeah, people don't watch their games  or don't go to their games  or don't buy their merchandise.  That's how it should work.  Right.  That's the free market saying...  Yeah.  Right.  Not the fucking government  stepping in and saying,  now we'll make your trademark invalid  so anybody can do it  and we'll fuck with your money that way.  It's just sickening.  It really is.  You shouldn't praise this decision.  No, that's awful. 
[02:43:30]  Even if you want the name changed,  this is not the way to go about it.  Yeah.  This is ugly.  That's gonna...  Yeah, because then they can do that with anything.  Yeah.  Then they could just say,  well, that's...  You know, we don't like...  We don't like what you're saying, so...  I don't think they do a trademark  and then you can't use it anymore.  Snyder was defiant,  no surprise there,  and vowed to immediately appeal the decision.  It was the second time since 1999  the Patent Office  had lifted the Redskins' trademark  and a federal court overturned  the first decision in 2003. 
[02:44:00]  So he had to fight it for...  He's got a precedent.  He had to fight it for four years  to make it go away the first time in 1999.  So, and he's gonna...  So, but like who...  Okay, she sues,  but then who supports it to the point of...  Like, who controls that patent?  Yeah, who actually says,  I'm pulling the patent.  We and the patent people are...  The patent guy?  Who's the patent guy?  You can't patent something,  apparently, or trademark it.  Fucking general patent.  Oh, fuck, call me,  and you stole my thunder.  They, uh...  You can't trademark something 
[02:44:30]  I think that's disparaging or offensive.  Like, that's always been the rules, really.  So what they did, I guess,  and they brought in newspaper articles  and stuff like dictionary definitions  from when this trademark  was originally issued  that showed that even then  Redskins meant something disparaging.  Right.  They're not doing it like,  oh, it's PC now,  and, uh, it's changed.  They're saying at the time  that it was issued,  it was still considered,  and it never should have been issued  to begin with.  And that's fine if it happened  five years ago, 
[02:45:00]  but the Redskins have existed  for so many years.  That's just...  1960 or something?  Isn't it longer than that?  Probably longer?  I don't know.  It's just kind of gross to go back.  Does anyone know officially?  Hmm.  Redskins.  I think Joe Theismann came out  and said he was proud  to be a Redskin.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, he kind of...  He spoke up a little bit about it.  Talk about wounded knee.  See?  Yes.  Yes.  Kind of a crack.  Him name carried on stretcher. 
[02:45:30]  Old leg-like pretzel rod.  I mean, back in the day,  they did pick the name  because they thought  it was a positive thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a warrior.  It's very strong.  Didn't go about naming their team  to make fun of anybody.  If anybody, the Braves.  Jeez, that friggin' logo.  Oh!  Oh!  That looks like the old blackface  they used to use on the cartoons.  Yeah, wow.  Kind of wacky.  Yeah.  Very big features. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Oversized features.  Yeah, Bugs Bunny.  Bugs Bunny did it.  Oh, yeah?  Have you ever seen band cartoons?  No.  It was a DVD or something,  but now it's all over the internet.  Oh, yeah?  Band cartoons.  Some of the things Bugs Bunny did.  Really?  Well, when Bugs went to,  I guess it was in Africa,  and they were trying to cook him in a pot,  and the guy was like,  I'm the bing-a-bonga!  And he goes,  I'm the bing-a-bunga!  No, there you go.  I'm the bong-a-binga-bunga!  First one.  I remember that.  First one.  Ah!  The most racist cartoon ever. 
[02:46:30]  Here it is.  It was Bugs Bunny.  Turn it more left.  It's the LazyTown Laundry.  Right.  Welcome to LazyTown.  Holy shit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Even the fish have big lips.  The black guy's fishing with his feet up,  and the fishing lines are on his toes.  The biggest lips ever.  Oh, my God.  I know.  You're almost scared to say what you're saying.  I know.  Giant, big, black guy.  Yeah, it's your huge pink lips.  Just black people sleeping all over in the middle of the day.  With no teeth on this one.  And he's sleeping. 
[02:47:00]  Huge lips.  His outer breath is blowing this, like,  hand her chicken back on a thing.  But see, the dog's also lazy.  Because it's lazy.  And he's white.  Yeah.  Wait till you hear how they talk.  Oh, jeez.  Here's the old codger.  He's picking cotton.  And putting it in the basket very slowly.  You can't tell if it's a monkey or a person.  No.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  Take that.  You take that.  Just slap me from that laser leg.  Very lazy.  Fuck you here.  Holy shit.  Lazy time.  Lazy time.  Well, now I'll stop for lunch.  Oh, now the hot fucking...  A hot lady walks in.  Oh, now they're up and around.  And they wake the fuck up.  The hot woman walks in and that gets them up.  Oh, shit.  That's a mama.  Giant fat black woman washing laundry. 
[02:48:00]  What do you want me to do?  What do you want me to do?  I'll show you what I mean.  And hold on, there's a little place where everyone goes to...  And then they sing a little wartime song.  Maybe that could be the new Redskins logo.  I can't believe this was 1996.  Oh, shit.  But if you put banned cartoons, I think, on YouTube, you'll see a bunch of these things. 
[02:48:30]  That is pretty wild.  Can we hear the song for a second?  What are they singing?  Oh, shit.  Are they singing watermelon?  Eating water.  A giant watermelon.  A big smile on his face.  Rubby a dub dub.  That's how she kicked it off.  Rubby a dub dub.  Rubby a dub dub.  Scrubbing the baby in the tub or something.  Oh, wow.  Anyway.  Wow.  Goes on and on.  Jeez.  What year is that?  A big stuff.  Oh, 40's, right?  I own the trademark to that guy's lips.  Wow. 
[02:49:00]  They're going to pull that one.  Even more disgusting about the whole Redskins situation is what MSNBC did.  Why?  What did they do?  They're the worst.  They will not mention the name Redskins as they're talking about this issue.  They actually will warn the viewers.  It's the R word?  Yes.  The new R word?  The new R word.  But they wonder why their network is in such dogshit ratings.  Yeah, nobody's watching.  It's a news story. 
[02:49:30]  We can handle the word Redskins.  And then in the next scene, they'll show dead people in Iraq.  Of course.  But hearing Redskins is offensive, and you have to warn people of that.  Good Lord.  MSNBC's, who is that?  Joy Reid warns her viewers before airing racial slur NFL team name.  Oh, my God.  This is even worse than what the patent office warns them.  God.  You got it?  I have it over here.  Oh. 
[02:50:00]  Football, what the rest of the world calls football, and we call soccer, might be big news these days with the World Cup.  But today, American football is making major headlines.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office announced today that it's canceling the trademark registration of Washington, D.C.'s professional football team.  Team owner Daniel Snyder maintains that the name of the team, a racial slur I won't say here, is meant to be respectful of Native American...  Oh, my God.  A racial slur I won't say here. 
[02:50:30]  I won't say here.  Oh, boy.  A racial slur.  That's where we've gotten so far.  Here we are.  ...is meant to be respectful of Native American heritage and football tradition.  God.  But, after an eight-year review, the patent office has ruled in favor of the five Native American plaintiffs who brought the suit and maintained the name is a racial slur.  The vote was two to one, by the way.  Was it?  I think it was only three votes.  It was only three people?  I won't say it here.  Yeah.  I won't say it here.  Who wants to live in that fucking world? 
[02:51:00]  Every single step you take is on an eggshell, and one misstep gets you fired, and what is okay today is not okay tomorrow.  Right.  It's just nonsense.  I won't say it here.  We can handle the word.  I'll say it for you.  Cunt.  And then this happened.  And speaking of revenue, Senator Harry Reid made actually an interesting case on the floor of the Senate, continuing to talk back to Dan Snyder, and I just want to warn people, he does use the name of the team, so I'm just going to warn you guys about that in advance. 
[02:51:30]  But let's listen to Senator Harry Reid.  Oh, my God.  He does use the name of the team, so.  I've got to warn you.  Cover your ears.  Yeah.  But what happens if you hear that?  Get your children out of the room.  Yeah, what would happen?  What happens?  You've heard it your whole life.  Do you have a nervous breakdown?  What happens?  What a groveling, awful, fucking hunk of shit network MSNBC is.  It's so phony.  The Washington Redskins.  It's so phony.  I'm going to warn you here that he uses the word.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Get ready, everybody. 
[02:52:00]  She must be a treat at her house.  What did you say?  Oh, God.  No.  It's so trumped up and phony.  That's the thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's this fake outrage.  Yes.  Like, you really are that offended by the word redskin.  I don't think she's all that offended.  No.  I mean, if you're an American Indian and you have a problem with this logo and all that,  all right, I get that.  Right.  But this woman who's not related to that, like, she's so fragile.  You know what?  I can't even say the word.  No.  She's compassionate, Tom. 
[02:52:30]  She knows.  Yeah, Tom.  She knows oppression and racism and racial slurs.  So she's not going to be party to this whole skins thing.  Oh, gross.  Yeah.  Gross.  Yo, my redskin.  Someone has a little more info on the ruling.  We might be getting some of the facts wrong.  Al in D.C.  Al.  Hey, hey, guys.  Thankfully, Anthony, you're somewhat incorrect. 
[02:53:00]  Nobody can start using the Redskins logo and team name.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they're still protected because they're appealing this.  And, number one, there's common law.  They've shown a history of using this so nobody else can go, you know.  And the big man, it's actually like Adidas and Nike.  You're not going to go and piss him off by suddenly printing off, you know, unlicensed jerseys.  You watch this upcoming football season, which obviously is, you know, we're getting close now.  So you watch some of these sports networks where they're going to start refusing to say the name. 
[02:53:30]  You watch.  You think ESPN would be not saying Redskins?  Oh, boy.  You watch.  Jeez.  Men's networks, as Jimmy likes to point out.  Men.  Men.  Men can't handle the word Redskins.  And down in the man cave, when you're in the man cave, you can't hear that?  Not in my man cave.  We'll be saying that.  They will change it.  What are they going to change it to?  What do you mean?  They're going to eventually change it.  Are the Redskins?  Yeah.  I wonder if they're going to call it.  The alcoholics.  What's that? 
[02:54:00]  The alcoholics.  It's all Indians are alcoholics.  Oh, God.  Alcoholics.  The Washington alcoholics.  So, what else did we get wrong, Al?  Is that good?  No, it's good.  But one important point.  This wouldn't be an issue if Dan Snyder wasn't so hated.  And because he came out so vehemently against us, he said, no, I'm not changing the team.  Just shut the fuck up.  Well, what's he supposed to do?  Apologizing?  I hate him, and I still think he had to address it, though.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  I disagree.  He should have just kept his mouth shut. 
[02:54:30]  I like that he's hanging in there.  That's for sure.  He's getting a lot of heat.  A lot of heat.  Yeah.  All right, man.  It can't be forced, though, man.  It's really a big difference, because I don't like it.  I still don't want them to be forced to change it.  Not at all.  No, that's not good.  That's not good for our country.  It's not the way to get shit done is you make the government steps in.  That's fucking disgusting.  Yeah.  It's very scary.  It is.  And people don't get it.  They don't get like when...  Because they agree with it.  They don't...  You don't have to be a libertarian to realize when the government's really overstepping their 
[02:55:00]  boundaries and infringing on your freedom of expression and freedom of  speech.  Are the libertarians speaking up at least?  Yeah, I think...  Yeah.  I've seen a couple on Fox talk about it.  And, you know...  But libertarians have looked at those kind of kooky people, too.  You know?  Like, yeah, all right.  Well, you've got to just pave the roads and leave me the fuck alone.  That's what I need the government for.  Pave the roads.  And I would just want to be able to fucking run around and shoot people. 
[02:55:30]  Which, by the way, I concur.  I was going to say, I am right there.  It sounds like a campaign speech for you running from the office.  This guy's got a great name.  Oh, Anthony Cumia on the phone.  A great new name for the Redskins.  This is it right here.  Go ahead, James.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, so just throw a fuck you to the censor board and just change a picture.  Change to a potato.  I like Redskins potatoes, you guys. 
[02:56:00]  Hello?  Oh, so they could be the Washington Redskins.  Oh, you heard that?  But it'll just be the potato.  Oh, you heard that?  The red potato.  You heard that?  Yeah.  What?  Holy shit.  You didn't go the other way, but that's all right.  No, it was...  Oh.  What?  I saw it a thousand times on Twitter last night.  I know.  That's why we're taking the call.  I know.  That's why you took the call.  It's a great name.  Hey, let's change it to the Redskins.  Redskins, but it's the potato.  You changed the logo on the side to potato.  Oh, I get it. 
[02:56:30]  Clever.  Very clever.  Very clever.  Clever.  Very clever.  Guys.  She warned us that we were going to hear the word Redskins.  Yes, look out.  She saved eight people.  The embarrassment.  Yes.  Who gives a shit?  I won't say it here.  I won't say it here.  No, not here.  Not on these airwaves.  You will not hear it on my program.  All they do is apologize.  They are fucking embarrassing.  Groveling.  They're embarrassing.  They really are.  They are.  And this whole thing, anyway, you know, because there are some pretty major issues out there 
[02:57:00]  that should be addressed by people with this amount of passion and this amount of debate  back and forth, things like, you know, Iraq, perhaps.  Poverty.  Yeah, yeah, the fact that there is an army of Mexican people invading our southern borders.  Trains full.  One of our greatest cities, Detroit, is no longer a city. 
[02:57:30]  Detroit?  How about that?  I don't even know what it is anymore.  They have billy goats going through, eating the vegetation that's growing in the middle  of city streets because they don't even afford a lawnmower.  There's no lawnmowers.  But I don't want to say red skin.  All this.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  It's just another distraction.  There's real issues out there.  There's literally billy goats walking through.  People should look into some of the real issues affecting America.  Good Lord.  People cannot be passionate about things that really matter. 
[02:58:00]  But things like this, you change the name of a football team.  It's very easy.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to help people.  And it doesn't last long, you know.  Right.  This will go away.  Just like those poor Nigerian schoolgirls that got kidnapped.  Remember?  Hashtag find our girls and get our girls home and stuff.  What happened to them?  They never found them.  They never found them, and I don't see no hashtags anymore.  I don't see Michelle Obama holding a sign with a hashtag anymore.  They're slacktivists. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  It's the easiest thing to be a social media activist these days.  It doesn't take any work.  No, you just tweet.  You just got to tweet a hashtag, say what you think, and then within a week at the most,  you don't even have to pay attention to it anymore.  You ruled for a week.  And you feel like you did something.  You did something.  And then on to the next thing.  I am important.  Let's go to David, who, he's not offended, but does agree with the ruling.  David in Albuquerque.  Hello. 
[02:59:00]  How's it going?  Hey, buddy.  So I'm a Navajo, and I just don't really see any offense to this.  Navajo, Navajo.  Navajo, yate hey, yate hey.  Uh-huh.  And I just see it kind of as a war term, kind of like a devil dog for the Marines, a badge  of honor, more like, than anything.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be like...  He's got a second part to this.  But?  Oh, but.  But.  You're speaking in a four-tongue.  I'm concerned. 
[02:59:30]  See?  What?  There are certain relatives of mine that would be offended.  Say, like, my grandma, who's older, and really doesn't know what it means.  Football.  But overall, the younger generation of Navajos are not offended by this.  And it's more of a offense that they're making us to be like pussies.  Pussy Navajos.  Yeah.  Huh.  So the older people don't like it, but you don't give a shit.  Yeah, I don't give a shit at all, and most of my cousins don't. 
[03:00:00]  I mean, I own an Albuquerque, not Albuquerque, an Atlanta Braves hat.  I own a Kansas City hat.  I mean, it's a badge of honor.  Like the Chiefs.  Wait.  Sure.  But it says on the phones here that you agree with the ruling, though.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you disagree with it.  My grandma would be the one who agrees with it.  Right.  Wait.  So you guys collect all the hats that have, like, Indian symbols?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  With the scalpel.  And my cousin has a Redskins hat, Oklahoma Thunder. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  What about the Cleveland Indians?  That one's a little rough, right?  What's that guy's name?  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  It's a little rough, a little rough.  Was it Chief Nakahoma?  Yeah, they sort of changed that logo.  Chief Wahoo.  Wahoo.  Wahoo.  Chief Nakahoma was, uh...  Atlanta?  That was Atlanta.  It might be Atlanta.  I believe so.  They're such fucking corn balls.  And the tomahawk chop.  Wahoo.  And they did the tomahawk chop thing.  Fucking corny people.  Yeah, very corny. 
[03:01:00]  Chief Nakahoma.  He would come out.  He'd come out every home run, though.  Knockahoma.  You're knocking a homer.  Knockin a homer.  Oh, I see.  And then he would do something like a rain dance every time they hit a homer.  He would come out of his teepee.  Yeah.  It's like the...  It's hard to come up with names.  It's like the Hakawi Indians.  They were walking around lost, and they came up to the guy, and they said, where the heck  are we?  And the guy thought he even said, where are the Hakawi Indians?  They called them the Hakawi Indians.  Nice.  Where the Hakawi?  They got my history from F Troop. 
[03:01:30]  Agon.  Apparently, the end of the Civil War was near.  They're making the Redskins logo pretty valuable.  When something is kind of banned, you want it even more, right?  If you had that logo, and they were just called the Indians, you'd have no...  There'd be no case, right?  I mean, it's just a beautiful Indian gentleman.  Right.  It really isn't offensive.  He looks very...  It's the word.  ...respected, and...  He's a warrior.  It's a racial slur, which I won't say here.  Oh, right.  That's right. 
[03:02:00]  But...  Redskins.  I can't hear that!  Stop it!  I'm sorry.  I have one last point to it.  Okay.  Oh, sure.  Before you get back to your bottle, go ahead.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God, King!  Oh, my God!  He with many points.  Yes.  Before I get back to the blackjack table.  Yes, go ahead, sir.  We will call you a mouth that won't shut.  It's my turn to throw crap.  Let's go.  Go ahead, Dave.  The chief talks a long time.  So, like, when a white person calls me Indian, now that's what I take offense to. 
[03:02:30]  Native American over Indian.  Now, if another Indian calls me Indian, that's no problem.  Oh, that's like the N-word.  Oh, the rules.  It's that N-word thing.  Yes.  It's the rules.  Got it.  So, you can't say Indian.  I do not like the Indian word by white people.  Your Indian name is Borum much.  Why is Indian a troublesome word?  It's more of like a savage word.  It's an incorrect term. 
[03:03:00]  But what if we say it and leave the N off at the end?  India.  Yeah.  Yeah, India.  I don't say it like that.  I say India.  India.  India.  My India.  My India.  Yeah, kid.  That's my motherfucking India.  What do you prefer?  Native American?  Yes.  Native American or Navajo is what I prefer.  Because Indian was the name that was given by the white man because of their misunderstanding 
[03:03:30]  that they were not in India.  They had dark skin and they thought they were Indians from India.  So, they could give them the name India.  Is that right?  Yeah.  So, you're showing your ignorance then.  Well, people were pretty stupid back then.  But you know what?  Get in a fucking ship and go halfway around the world.  Take some balls.  So, what?  You're not that smart.  Yeah, you should.  You guys should have.  Navigate by the stars.  You guys should have built a boat and went the other way.  Yeah, go the other way.  Meet in the middle and go, where are you going?  Right.  You go one way, go in the other, India in the middle and say, what do you want from 
[03:04:00]  me?  Let's go get some molasses.  In the, uh, in the, uh.  David, thanks for your insight on the topic at hand.  Thank you, sir.  Greatly appreciate your phone call, certainly.  So, he added another bad word.  So, it's red skin and Indian.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who thought Indian was, you know?  Yeah, Indian.  Indian.  Native Americans.  Mmm.  So many rules.  It is the Indian way.  Didn't they just say that?  MSNBC literally sounded like a satire.  Yeah.  It sounds like an SNL skit. 
[03:04:30]  It really does.  Like they didn't want to say it.  I will not say the word here.  I will not say that word.  And then I also won't say this word.  And they warn you about it.  Just figure out what I'm trying to say.  A warning.  Warning.  Warning, Will Robinson.  She will say red skin.  What do we need a warning for?  You know what's going to happen?  It's not a sad one.  I don't know what happens if you hear it.  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado who wants to comment on the Albuquerque call.  Go ahead, Eric.  So I wanted to talk a little bit about this savage from Albuquerque.  Oh, jeez.  Why is he a savage? 
[03:05:00]  That's not savage.  Well, you know, it's the fact that I felt like the entire time he was Indian giving his  opinion.  Oh, see.  He would say one day and then he'd come right back and say, well, but I get offended by  this.  Or my family doesn't like this.  I mean, come on.  Stick on one side or the other, buddy.  He was saying.  I thought he agreed with certain things, but his family didn't agree or vice versa.  His older family members certainly have more of a problem with it than the younger generation. 
[03:05:30]  Indian giving.  So.  All right.  Sorry to go for that.  Yes.  Yeah.  He was.  Yeah, that was like it was all just.  He was Indian giving his.  Really?  Get it, guys.  Get it.  With his buffalo nickel.  You get it.  Yeah.  So we'll see what happens with that.  It looks like there's an appeal that'll happen or has happened and this will just keep going  on and on.  Yeah.  No real victory there yet. 
[03:06:00]  So according to the Albuquerque guy, the Cleveland Indians would.  That's a bad.  That's offensive.  I guess.  That's offensive too.  Yeah.  Indian red skin.  I know squaw is very bad for a woman.  You can't call a woman, a Native American, a squaw.  A squaw.  But meanwhile, like if you watch the Brady Bunch episode where they went to the Grand Canyon,  they do refer to Indian women as squaws because at the time that was fine and they play that  on goddamn regular television all the time.  For now.  Yeah.  For now. 
[03:06:30]  For now.  Mr. Brady kissing Carol.  Another great lie that was told on.  How many times she must watch that and then just Purell her face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember that one where Bobby and Cindy got lost in the bottom of the Grand Canyon and  they met the Indian kid and they brought him some beans and franks in the flashlight.  And then for saving this little Indian kid, the Indian guy invited the whole family to  a big powwow to give them Indian names.  Let's see that. 
[03:07:00]  Do we see that?  It's great.  That's really good.  And then they're dancing around the fire going like, hiya, hiya, hiya.  Oh, it is talking about racist.  In their blue jeans.  Oh, it's very racist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Douchey.  Yeah.  They call Mr. Brady he who sit on fist.  Punch him.  Call him.  Call him.  All right.  Say calling.  I'm tuckered out.  Fine.  I'm sleepy.  Full screen, Sammy. 
[03:07:30]  This is good stuff.  Come on now.  Uh-oh, it's called Brady Bunch Promise Not to Tell.  Uh-oh.  What's the matter?  He has a little hat on.  Yeah.  Now here comes Ian.  And they play like the dun-dun-dun-dun drums.  Let me handle this.  Oh, boy.  You know who did the music for this show?  The same guy that played Happy Kind in the orchestra on Fernwood Tonight.  How are you?  Fred Duvall, I think his name was.  He did a lot of music for TV shows back in the day.  I'm Jimmy Pacaya. 
[03:08:00]  Do you live around here?  Well, not too far.  Good acting.  Are you a real Indian?  Uh-huh.  Have you seen a camp around here?  One with tents and stuff?  Tents in the guy's pants, in the father's pants when he looks at the other boys?  Hey, look.  We're kind of lost.  Could you help us get back to our folks?  No.  Nah.  I hate the laughs.  Fucking Indian.  I've got my reasons.  You don't like the canned laughs?  No, because I wouldn't laugh there.  No.  I wouldn't.  I wouldn't.  Oh, he's going to go sit on a rock.  So we can have a talk. 
[03:08:30]  He's going to talk about his people.  He looks sad.  Don't you like us pale faces?  Oh.  Pale face stuff.  Sorry.  Knock off that pale face stuff.  Why won't you help us?  The episode where he scalps Bobby and rapes Cindy.  Or does the opposite.  I don't like from home.  Very special episode.  The Indian looks like a Jewish kid from Sherman Oaks.  It was Sherwood Schwartz's grand.  Oh, shit. 
[03:09:00]  They're really getting him on.  Oh, no.  Come here, quick.  Now they're looking for the kid.  It's the footprint.  Oh.  And they're headed towards the men's room.  Why is there drool here? 
[03:09:30]  Why is it wet over here?  Oh, shit.  We just passed.  That was, uh.  Did they scamper off the other way?  Yeah.  And they all, you remember how they all got down to the bottom of the canyon?  No.  Donkeys.  They all took donkeys down.  And Mr. Brady was riding on the bottom of one.  It was a very odd way to write it down. 
[03:10:00]  Lovingly, it's called an ass.  Oh, wow.  It's nice.  Yes.  It was great.  She'll take one of the strokes, Mrs. Brady.  That dumb hairdo.  It was a bad hairdo.  She was 20 feet away.  Did you see how they filmed that scene?  It's Jack White.  And why wouldn't you be in the bottom of the Grand Canyon dressed in polyester?  Right.  It's got to be comfy.  Jack White.  Thank you.  Hey, Sam.  Mrs. Brady looks like Jack White.  I want to see the dance.  Well, that's toward the end of the episode.  It's a dance, Sam.  Indian, uh. 
[03:10:30]  It's, it's.  Oh, what's he say?  Mr. Brady.  Mr. Brady's back.  Mr. Brady's back.  Indian powwow thing.  You two guys, you don't go away from camp without being with an adult or with Greg or  Marsha.  Okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Come on, let's get cleaned up for dinner.  All right.  Back in the tent, boys.  Yeah.  Zip.  We'll have a boys weekend.  We're going to get the food for Jimmy.  Oh, then they steal food for Jimmy.  I've been thinking about it.  I've got a plan.  Yeah, this isn't the.  All right, let's.  It was actually a.  Is that a two-parter?  It might have been a three-parter.  Oh, no.  I know the Hawaiian episode was a three-parter, I believe. 
[03:11:00]  That was three parts?  Yeah.  This one.  And then the real bad one when they went to that Cleveland amusement park.  Oh, it's not bad.  I think they just, like, the amusement park, um, Kings.  Ah.  They, I think they just, like, decided, well, we're going to do a commercial on your show.  So, the whole Brady people come on and just show how great this amusement park is.  So, they kind of made this half-assed story.  Right.  And had them on the rides.  Is that with the plans?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:11:30]  And, you know, they lose the plans.  Of course.  That was always their go-to thing.  They lose the plans because Mr. Brady always used the tube they put it in for something else.  We had to go to the airport.  He's like, how can I get 40 gerbils onto one flight?  Hey, an architecture tube.  Why don't we take a break and we'll find that scene from the Brady Bunch for everybody.  Goddamn too much.  We've got to talk about what's going on in Japan as well.

Hello, I'm Dr. Roger Sidaway, and as a gastroenterologist, I've been telling my patients for years that in order to keep things moving, you need to eat fiber, drink plenty of water, and exercise. 
[03:15:30]  Now I tell my patients to elevate their knees above their waist with the Squatty Potty footstool when they go.  Here's why.  Anatomically, humans were designed to squat, but then we started sitting, and sitting brought on problems like constipation and hemorrhoids.  So the real problem is how we sit.  That's why I recommend the Squatty Potty.  The Squatty Potty is so simple because it helps you elevate your knees while enjoying the comfort of your own toilet. 
[03:16:00]  Plus, the Squatty Potty is for everyone, not only those with problems.  I recommend it for the entire family.  In fact, my family uses it.  Just in time for summer, buy two and get free delivery, plus use code OPI, and receive a free bottle of Sweet Lou Deodorizer, a $10 value.  Go to SquattyPotty.com.

[03:23:00]  Hey, what's the deal with all of the attorney advertisements  regarding Androgel and other testosterone treatments?  They cite some cardiovascular risk and studies.  Just wondering what's up with that.  Thanks.  Love you.  This is a great question because we're always talking about testosterone therapy  on Weird Medicine.  There was a recent study that followed 55,593 patients 
[03:23:30]  who were on testosterone therapy,  and they first looked at one year before they were treated  and then 90 days after,  and they found an increased risk two times normal in men over 65  and also for men under 65 who had known heart disease.  This was increased risk for heart attack in the first 90 days of treatment,  but there's a lot more to this issue.  Of the 55,000 patients that were studied,  there were only 65 cases of heart attack in the post-treatment group, 
[03:24:00]  and of the 48,000 men younger than 65,  there were only 45 had heart attacks during the monitoring phase,  and that works out to about 3.76 cases in every 1,000 patient years  were a risk of 0.376%.  Given that the pre-treatment phase yielded a risk of 0.322%,  the actual increase in risk or the absolute risk is very small.  And doing a little mathematics on this shows that we would have to treat  almost 2,000 patients with testosterone to get a single adverse effect, 
[03:24:30]  and this was in patients with known heart disease.  So my recommendation is this.  If you have the symptoms of low testosterone,  which are fatigue, lack of sex drive, erectile dysfunction, or physical weakness,  and your testosterone is low, and you're under 65,  the risk of heart attack is vanishingly small if you're otherwise healthy.  As always, discuss with your regular medical provider, and happy boning!  Be sure to check out Weird Medicine Saturdays at 10 p.m. Eastern,  right here on the Opie and Anthony Channel. 
[03:25:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  One serious exit.  We've got Tom Papa, who left us for L.A. a few months back.  How's L.A. treating you?  It's all right. I don't know.  It's not New York.  You miss New York, right?  Of course.  The family adjusting, though?  The family, the kids love it. 
[03:25:30]  The wife hates it?  The wife hates it.  The wife wants to be in New York.  Really?  And, uh, but now the kids have roots, and they're in schools, and they have friends, and...  And you get to leave L.A. all the time.  I get to leave and come here and see you guys and do things all the time, and she's in the  house there, just like, all I do is drive a minivan from here to there and sit in traffic,  and I'm going to kill myself.  I guess you don't realize how easy it is, how much easier it is for kids to make friends  than it is an adult to make a friend. 
[03:26:00]  Kids are just like, ah, hey, you have a red ball?  Me, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You walk up to them in the supermarket, be my friend.  Be my friend.  You bought cornflakes.  Me, too.  I like you.  Be my best friend.  I like you.  Police.  Call the police.  Yeah, you're best friends within ten minutes.  Right, exactly.  And even if you have friends in L.A., and you see his friends, but they're ten miles away,  and ten miles in L.A. is easily an hour and a half ride. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, everyone lives in different towns.  Because the traffic is so intense.  It's such a pain in the ass to get anywhere, so she's just kind of not that happy.  Wow, man.  What do you do?  It's important for her to be happy, so the rest of us are happy, but now the kids are  like, we love it here, and we've got our friends, and I'm not going.  We're leaving the school.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  So, I don't know.  Maybe just pay for her to come back on her own more often. 
[03:27:00]  Every so often.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know what to do.  Wow, yeah.  You know, to have an apartment here that's going to sit empty for 90% of the time is, I don't  know.  It's wasteful.  My friend was telling me I should go to Jersey City, get a place in Jersey City.  Nice.  How's that?  Up and coming.  Yeah, it's up and coming, and it's still, you know, anytime you're taking the path.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's like an hour. 
[03:27:30]  You leave the cellar to go to Jersey City.  It's a long commute.  It's like, oh, it's a commute.  Yeah.  It's a long commute.  Yeah.  You want to just walk out and cab right to your...  Right where you're going.  Your doorstep.  How would you ever walk out of the apartment right when a cab's coming by with the light  on it, and you just go, taxi?  And they start...  It's like...  It always reminds me of a movie.  Yeah.  Like, that's exactly how it happens.  It's how it happens.  Walk out and rah.  There it is.  Yeah.  That's how it's supposed to work.  Taxi.  And, uh...  Yeah, so I don't know. 
[03:28:00]  We'll figure it out.  But L.A.'s...  Oh, Tom.  Oh.  You better figure that out.  Yeah, man.  I don't know.  And you leave every weekend, right?  Every Thursday.  Oh, yeah.  Daddy's got to work.  So you could sympathize with her plight?  Daddy's got to work.  Yeah.  Sam.  You got a pool, at least?  And, uh...  A pool in the back?  Yeah, I got a pool.  It's all very nice.  It's all very nice.  A gilded cage.  That's wonderful.  I find her floating in the pool. 
[03:28:30]  I, uh...  You know...  And you know it's the bad thing,  is that it's tied to...  All right, the kids want to be there for their thing,  but it's also because, you know,  I'm trying to do TV stuff.  Exactly.  That's where it is.  So any time something goes wrong,  like if a show doesn't go,  or if I don't get a part,  she's immediately like,  so should we go back to New York?  So it makes me think, like,  she's quietly rooting against me.  Right.  Like, I'd rather you fail 
[03:29:00]  so I can get back to Manhattan.  She's probably getting frustrated.  She's probably putting stuff in your food  to make you a little drowsy  for auditions and stuff.  I gained, like, ten pounds  since I've been there,  and it's like,  it's up to you  to kind of eyeball me  and tell me what I'm...  But I realize she's fattening me up  so I don't get parts.  So you don't get parts.  Yeah, she's like,  you fat loser,  let's get back to New York.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  You got stuff coming out, though, right?  She's, yeah.  A couple movies and things like that.  I got in Soderbergh's new thing, 
[03:29:30]  The Nick,  with Clive Owen,  that's coming out on Cinemax.  I mean, that starts in August.  Nice.  And, uh, yeah.  I got some things,  but I don't even, like,  I got one on the phone,  and, like, I have, like,  you know,  we're trying to shoot this TV show,  and it's like,  I don't even tell my wife updates  because I feel like  she's going to put the whammy on it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No.  Really?  I get a little, like...  She hates it that much.  Well, you know,  you get superstitious  about showbiz stuff,  and, you know,  there's momentum and vibes,  you don't want to jinx things, 
[03:30:00]  and there's all that kind of stuff  that goes on  when you're waiting  for anything in life.  You don't need any negativity  in the house.  What doesn't you like about OI?  Uh, the driving  is the biggest thing.  The driving.  Like the friends.  You drive everywhere.  You don't see people.  You just don't see anybody.  You get in your little minivan.  It's lonely.  It's very spread out.  It's lonely.  It's lonely.  It's isolating.  It's just you're by yourself.  It's like here,  you can take a walk around the block,  and you feel like you've touched humanity, 
[03:30:30]  and you feel a part of something.  There,  even if you get in the car,  what are you going to go,  what are you going to do?  Where are you going?  You're going to a mall.  You're going to shop.  If you don't have to shop,  then what are you doing?  Everyone's in L.A.  because they have to be there.  I know.  No one's there  because they want to be.  I know.  It really is.  I like that DeRosa prick.  The guy fucking might as well  just fall off the earth.  I saw him at a bar.  Of course you did.  Being dragged out by his ankles. 
[03:31:00]  I was doing some show,  and he's very L.A. now.  But he was made for L.A.  We all know him.  Did you like the finger gun?  Tommy!  I don't know what he was saying.  I just walked by him,  and I heard the words  TBS and demographics.  And kept walking.  Oh, no.  We looked like L.A.  before we even got there.  He's funny.  So I don't know.  Someone asked me the other day 
[03:31:30]  when I was on stage  about what's the difference  between New York and L.A.?  Which is kind of a cliche thing to ask.  But I just blurted it out,  and I don't know if this even makes sense,  but I said,  to me,  New York is like a jazz club,  and L.A. is like a TV's asshole.  I don't even know what that means,  but that is what L.A. feels to me.  But you could kind of figure out  what it means.  Yeah.  Your mind knows what it means.  Great place to sink your dick.  Oh, you mean television.  Oh, see? 
[03:32:00]  How are the comics out there?  They're not as close  as New York comics, right?  No.  They're not.  Well, they don't come up there  and they transplant there.  They go out there to make it.  So it's like,  there's funny guys out there,  but they don't have that clique  that you have in New York or Boston  because their roots are not there.  No, and there's no real center  of where you hang out.  There's like this meltdown show  that's like on a Wednesday,  so that's the one place  you can hang out on a Wednesday.  And then there's something 
[03:32:30]  that goes on a UCB  or at the improv  on like a Thursday,  so you can hang out there that night.  It's not like here,  it's like everyone goes down  to the olive tree in the cellar  and you're around good people  and good people are coming in  and you're just held to the standard  and everyone's working  just to be great at that.  But there it's like,  you know,  there's good guys,  but we're all there  to whore ourselves up for TV.  It's like,  I want to be a good comic,  but I also want to get on a show  or I want to get a film.  So there's no community  just for the art of stand-up. 
[03:33:00]  You know,  that part is really,  that to me  is the worst part of it.  What do you do with,  like do you go out to dinner  with the wife  and you know,  kind of,  do you do anything  to get her out of the house?  Yeah,  yeah.  I mean,  it's on me,  right?  Yeah.  It kind of is at that point.  So it's like,  all right,  so let's go do that.  Yeah.  But you know,  even that,  you'll go to a really nice restaurant.  A really nice restaurant in LA  is in a strip mall.  Oh.  And it's,  that's just the way 
[03:33:30]  that it's built.  And then you get,  you're done with dinner,  you get in the minivan  and then drive home.  And it's like here,  it's like you go to the village  and you go to a nice restaurant  and then you take the stroll  through the,  Yeah,  you can walk.  Through Washington Square Park  and the lights through the trees.  Like,  let's walk back.  And you walk  and it's a whole nother experience  and you're just,  it's romantic.  You get a cup of joe.  You get a cup of joe.  Let's get an espresso  before we go.  Let's do that.  Hey,  we just ran into our friend  who was walking that way.  Meanwhile,  the nice restaurant  in the strip malls 
[03:34:00]  next to the Korean place  and the,  the frigging Mexican geraint.  I never liked the strip malls  in LA.  That's all there are though.  You're right.  You pull up  and it's,  it's the fucking  little sign in front  of the strip mall.  and it's just,  and it's a great food  and there's creative people  and there's great stuff,  but it's,  it's just in that  different kind of vibe.  So when you're moving back,  it's obvious.  Oh boy.  Is it?  Yeah.  Another year maybe.  Is it?  Is that the,  I guess.  But not,  then the kids will be mad.  The kids will be mad.  Well,  you're shooting,  you gotta be out there.  The kids will be mad. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  If you're shooting,  but if you're not shooting,  your wife's packing boxes.  Oh shit.  How awful is that?  If you call and shoot,  how would you audition?  You're like,  I don't know.  And you come home  and there's a Frigidaire box  that's closed in.  Big Mayflower truck  in front of the house.  Over the phone,  you just hear that tape.  Yeah.  What?  You hearing,  you hearing that  black magic marker  squeak writing  miscellaneous  knickknacks  Oh,  baby,  that's so,  bring home 
[03:35:00]  some fragile stickers.  Some bubble wrap.  I,  yeah,  I don't know.  But the big,  look,  if it wasn't,  if we,  if the kids weren't around,  we could come back tomorrow  and we can go back.  It's,  it wouldn't matter.  But they're now going into like junior high  and friends  and they're working all that.  And it's,  you can't,  you really gotta keep an eagle eye on them,  right?  It's hard.  I mean,  how do you not,  uh,  how do you keep telling them  they can't have friends?  Just keep moving all over the place. 
[03:35:30]  And you gravitate towards people like,  well,  I moved a lot when I was a kid.  That worked out for me.  Look,  I turned out fucking great.  I was going around.  All right.  You did that.  Oh,  I was moving all over.  And were you cool with it?  Every year,  year and a half.  Did you cry?  I cried at everything anyway.  My father called me pissy eyes.  It was always pissy eyed.  Right.  Stop it.  I'll give you something to cry about.  And he created that though.  Well,  right.  I mean,  if he just kept you in one place 
[03:36:00]  and you had like friends  in this little community,  maybe you wouldn't be pissing at me.  Cause I would make friends.  I'd make pretty good friends.  And then it was like,  uh,  we gotta move.  And I'd never understand why.  It's like,  oh,  and I always knew when they'd have  the biggest argument ever,  we were moving very soon.  Because obviously,  he lost his job or something  or hadn't been paying the rent  on the house.  You know,  whatever it was.  And it was time to move.  So let's pack up it.  And each move,  we went to a worse  and worse neighborhood. 
[03:36:30]  Holy shit.  You know.  It explains everything.  Not moving on up.  Central Islip was a great place  on Long Island.  That was a lot of fun.  I don't know.  I mean,  there is good stuff  because then you learn  to meet people  and you learn how to adapt.  Yes, adaptability.  But you're too old  to have to adapt.  You know what I mean?  I know.  You get to a point  where you don't want to adapt.  You just want friends.  You just want your room.  You just want close friends.  I don't know.  And it's awkward  as an adult male  to, like, 
[03:37:00]  make that move  to try to make a new friend.  It happens at the playgrounds  and you feel like,  I don't know,  do you want my number?  Do you have a number?  Why are you waiting  at the bottom of the slide?  Exactly,  with your anus open.  That's inappropriate.  I'm going to come home  with that excitement  that I just met someone new  that might be a new friend.  I think I made a friend today.  He's really great.  Yeah,  you talk about him  like you're dating or something, 
[03:37:30]  but you're just excited  that you might have a friend.  Could you pass the potatoes?  Hey,  I think I made a friend today.  That's exactly how it goes down.  Did you give me the salt?  I said,  no,  he's like a really nice guy.  Did you exchange numbers?  Yeah,  we exchanged numbers.  I'm going to get my phone now.  You know,  he said he's going to be  at the park Thursday,  so.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to get a call.  Oh, man.  It's horrible.  Why is that?  Well, look,  I mean,  are you really looking  for new friends at this point?  No.  No,  but I'm not.  Like,  I don't mind making them 
[03:38:00]  organically,  but like,  oh my God,  when people are trying  to be your friend,  just think I'll die.  Oh, no,  that I don't deal with at all.  It's tedious.  No,  every once in a while,  you hit it off a little bit.  Yeah,  I mean,  look,  I think I made a new friend today.  Well,  with the kids,  you know,  you're with the other parents a lot,  and if you find a couple that's cool,  that's a unique thing,  where you,  Oh,  that's almost impossible.  you like both of them,  and then it kind of works,  and we have good people.  And then they say,  you swing?  Oh,  so it gets better.  Oh,  geez.  Oh,  boy.  Oh, 
[03:38:30]  boy.  Camping trips.  You nailed it with the kids playing with a whole bunch of kids,  and then you see their parents,  you're like,  oh,  please don't like that kid,  please don't like that kid,  because you know the parent's an asshole.  Yeah.  You just know already,  and like,  oh,  do not be friends with them,  because then you fast forward and realize,  oh,  my God,  I'm going to be standing next to this guy a lot,  and I already know I hate his guts.  Right.  He's going to be your pal.  It forces you into situations with people.  Oh,  fuck that.  Next thing you know,  they're in your house.  You would never invite these people in your house. 
[03:39:00]  But you have to.  Because the kids get along.  You know what's funny,  though?  So there's a huge relief when your kid will openly say on the way home or something,  like,  yeah,  I don't like such and such.  I'm like,  thank God.  You have to kind of badmouth the kid.  I know,  he seems terrible.  Fucking picking his nose,  scratching his asshole.  But it also works the other way,  where you hit it off with parents,  but the kids don't get along,  and I try to push the kid,  like,  you sure you don't like that one?  I know,  I have to.  Because he has big tits.  Because that has happened as well.  When you push him toward other kids.  You always think that you're the one passing judgment, 
[03:39:30]  like,  well,  I don't like that guy.  Oh,  they do the same to me.  I know.  I'm not stupid.  That guy doesn't like me at all.  Yeah,  maybe.  I'm a dick.  Fuck him.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  of course.  That guy thinks I'm an idiot.  What a huge relief when you realize they don't like the kid.  Yeah.  Of the parents you don't like.  Yeah,  for sure.  Good.  To get the whole scenario.  But as like a single guy with no kids,  there's no reason to make new friends.  Right.  You can make acquaintances and business associates and stuff,  but friends,  it's like,  yeah.  Yeah,  we're just going to start hanging out. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  Hey,  you want to come over and go swimming?  What?  I was just thinking when you were saying that,  how about making one?  Fuck that.  Sit alone in my house.  Love it.  I got a friend,  Beavis,  my cat.  That's all I need.  I'm a huge fan of being alone myself,  to be honest with you.  I love it.  Alone.  I mean,  I fucking love it.  A hotel room by myself.  Oh,  it could be the greatest thing ever. 
[03:40:30]  It's like heaven.  It really is like,  just to lay on my back,  red eagle on the bed with no one to talk to,  is just like a dream.  It's amazing.  It really is.  I mean,  I agree.  Like going on the road,  it would be like,  is that hard?  Are you kidding me?  I'm on the plane alone.  I'm in the room alone.  Yeah.  And then,  you know,  do the show.  I'm around a bunch of people.  You can get that feeling like you're with people.  And then back to alone. 
[03:41:00]  There have been times I've invited someone over my house.  And within a few minutes,  I'm like,  why did I do this?  Like,  fuck,  man.  You came that fast,  huh?  No foreplay at all.  That's funny.  As soon as the deed is gone,  man.  Get out!  That's funny. 
[03:41:30]  Let's talk about Japan.  Ah,  Japan.  What do they do?  Oh,  I think I know this story.  I really think so.  I was surprised at this,  because you would assume this had been done at an earlier juncture.  Japan's child porn ban,  they're finally banning child porn is the key to the story today.  Finally.  Oh.  It was legal.  It was?  Up until very recently.  I had no idea.  But Japan's child porn ban excludes anime and manga.  Did we talk about,  is that how you say it?  I don't know that one. 
[03:42:00]  Manja?  Manja?  Manga?  How do you say it?  What is that?  Manja maybe?  What?  I know anime.  Huh?  I think you were right.  I think it's manga.  Manga.  I think.  We know anime,  but I don't know manga.  What's manga?  Yeah,  what is that?  A manga.  A manga.  I think I'm eating one in my room right now.  A manga.  It's a manga.  I have some manga on my fork.  It's just another form of Japanese animation.  It's sort of like anime?  Yeah.  But what's the difference between the two?  It's Afghanistan animation.  Because you're showing us manga,  and it looks like anime.  So what's the difference?  I don't really know what the difference is.  Let me say it again. 
[03:42:30]  What's the difference?  What's the difference?  It's just another word for it,  probably.  Manga are comics.  There you go.  Anime is like cartoons.  Cartoons.  Okay.  Thank you to the people of PalTalk.  Kev Slider,  who is the biggest nerdy geek then.  I like Kev Slider.  I know Kev Slider.  But to know that,  he's one of the good ones.  Yeah, I know.  We got good ones.  A lot of bad ones,  but we got the good ones too.  Japan's newly enacted law  banning possession of child pornography  will not apply to anime or manga comics, 
[03:43:00]  which will still be allowed to feature  images of pedophilia.  Now,  they were able to have child porn before this.  That's what I'm getting at.  Was it popular?  Yeah, right.  Well,  they explain here,  the law passed Japan's upper house of parliament  on Wednesday,  making it the last country  in the developed world  to outlaw child pornography.  What was the vote?  I want to know what the number of the vote was.  If it wasn't unanimous.  You know what?  I bet you there was a guy like, 
[03:43:30]  son of a bitch.  Freedom of expression.  That's what I'm fighting for.  Not the pornography.  I would love to know the vote.  She was right.  A 1999 law made production and distribution  of child pornography illegal,  but didn't cover possession of such material.  So if you had like an old copy.  So it's been illegal since 99,  but you were allowed to possess it  if you already had it.  If you make it or sell it.  If it was grandfathered in.  Creepy grandfathered in. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Creepy grandfathered in.  It was uncleed in.  Hey,  if you have any friends,  by the way,  that now you know why they were going,  ah,  Japan,  the mid-90s,  what a great place.  Now you understand what that was about.  Why is he always going over there?  So illegal since 99,  but you were allowed to have it.  Yeah.  Japan has faced external pressure  to fall in line with the rest of the world,  but also opposition domestically  from the large and profitable  manga and anime industries, 
[03:44:30]  which have argued that  it's a freedom of expression issue.  Oh boy.  See,  that's what they'll always do.  Right.  Freedom of expression.  Yeah.  Thank you,  to you.  No problem.  My turkey chili,  yo.  Turkey chili.  It's pretty good shit.  Nice.  I must say.  I must say.  That is crazy that it was,  I wonder how popular it was.  Then everything would be all right.  Sam Kinison.  Silly putty.  Oh,  shit. 
[03:45:00]  Got your turkey chili,  man.  Some things are just for us.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Let's see.  External pressure.  All right.  So they've been arguing that  it's a freedom of expression issue.  The new law will give offenders  a year to dispose of offending material  before.  So you get one more year  with your child.  One more year.  One more year.  Rock it out.  Guys are planning out their vacation  for the last four months.  They can literally just wake up, 
[03:45:30]  jerk off,  go back to sleep.  Wow.  That's crazy.  The new law will give offenders  a year to dispose of offending material  before prosecutions are brought.  Those who fail to do so  will face up to a year in jail  and fines up to $10,000,  it looks like.  Very dishonorable.  While Japanese manga,  is that what we're going with here?  We're going with manga.  What is manga?  While Japanese manga and anime  have fans worldwide,  much of the more extreme material 
[03:46:00]  gets little exposure  outside the country.  Despictions of violence,  rape, incest,  and a whole host of fetishes  can be found in manga and anime.  We know that.  Many believe the fantastical,  how do you say that?  How do you spell it?  F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C-A-L.  Fantastical.  Fantastical nature of the media  mean the themes are harmless  as Japan enjoys  some of the lowest crime rates  in the world.  It's so ludicrous 
[03:46:30]  that it defies logic.  In the cartoon, you mean?  Right, right.  Yeah, try to do that in America.  Try to say that's...  It's just so crazy.  Actually, you're allowed  to depict child pornography  in America in animated form  and in cartoon form.  And Photoshop.  And Photoshop.  They deemed that  freedom of expression.  Freedom of expression, really?  Yeah.  You just, you know,  it's a real deal.  You're going to fucking get jammed up.  Because what happens is  if you say that,  as much as that sounds  like a gross thing,  then you get into a weird area.  Like, if that's really  considered porn,  even though it's not,  okay, well then why not, 
[03:47:00]  isn't violence against a kid  in a film considered  truly violent,  then it's a whole fucking...  Yeah, because now you're  going to start depicting,  like, that movie,  what was it,  Orphan?  Where the girl was  supposed to be  a young girl  and she turned out  to be the older girl.  Spoiler!  And she was trying  to have sex with the dad  and they thought  she was 14 at the time.  Like, that could be  a depiction  of child pornography.  Oh, right.  Oh, that creepy movie  Orphan.  Yeah, man.  It just hit me.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  Then all of a sudden 
[03:47:30]  she took her dress off  and she all of a sudden  looked like some  old Romanian woman.  Right.  I don't know what happened.  Oh, that's a creepy...  Well, the trailer was creepy.  I never saw it.  It was creepy.  Oh, when she's trying  to pick up the father  and stuff,  when she's still, like,  dressed like the orphan girl.  I was in a gang  called The Orphans.  No, I don't think  you were, Chip.  Warriors!  And Japan,  we're the orphans.  We're a pretty tough outfit.  Hey, we're the orphans.  The orphans sucked.  They were terrible.  Even their parents  didn't like them.  Oh, we heard of you, guys. 
[03:48:00]  And they say Japan  enjoys some of the lowest  crime rates in the world, so...  Oh, they enjoy it.  They have no time  to come across.  They're all too tired  molesting children.  What a fucking creeps.  What a weird place.  What a strange  fucking place.  The last country  to ban porn  child pornography.  When the world  has no problems  with dropping  two atomic bombs  on you,  it affects your psyche  for many generations  to come. 
[03:48:30]  Hey, look,  they dropped bombs  on us, yes,  but everyone agreed  they should.  Everyone was fine  with it.  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are they?  No, atomic bombs.  Two of them.  Right.  No one's running  to your defense.  Yeah.  No one said  that was harsh.  Right.  We got a gynecologist  with a perv switch.  We talk about  the perv switch  on our show.  The perv switch.  Yeah.  We all have it.  Uh-huh.  But we keep it  in check.  It's more like  a breaker than a switch. 
[03:49:00]  We call it  a perv switch, though.  And some people's,  they have a higher  amperage than others.  Some's go off  very quickly.  Others,  you gotta sit and wait.  You know?  Sometimes you shouldn't  be a gynecologist  if that switch is very...  If you got a hair trigger  on that.  It's like when you see  a girl  they're wearing  a lot less clothes  and you're like,  oh man,  that's pretty cool.  But then you move on.  And all the guys are like,  I gotta grab those tits  right now!  I wonder what their breasts,  look at,  they're so simple. 
[03:49:30]  I wonder what they feel like.  I'm gonna touch them!  And they can't even  fucking deal.  That's the perfs.  We're all friends  with those guys.  Most of us  kind of just move on.  You're like,  alright,  I gotta turn right now  and move on.  Shouldn't be a gynecologist  if you have  an itchy trigger finger.  Charged with sexual abuse  against pregnant patients.  An Upper East Side  gynecologist  has been charged  with sexually abusing  six patients.  Jeez.  Robert Haddon,  55,  is accused in court papers  of fondling  and performing  oral sex.  Nice!  Oral sex!  How do you get that done? 
[03:50:00]  How do you get that done?  Do you wonder,  when you're doing  something like that,  you're grabbing those tits,  do you feel like you're doing it  or is it outer body?  Do you see your hands?  It's like all of a sudden  you kind of wake up  and go,  oh my god,  I'm touching her tits.  You ever see  when they film  point of view stuff  on TV?  How it always looks  a little bit weird?  Is that how you see  your hands?  Whose hands are those  grabbing tits?  The point of view shot  is never done  on a tripod.  It's always a handheld  rocking and rolling.  You feel like you're floating  and someone else's hands  are behind you. 
[03:50:30]  Look at that TV character  grabbing her tits,  but I can feel them.  Oh no,  she's awake.  Uh oh.  Now the fondling,  I'm thinking like  where the doctor  could say,  no man,  I really needed to do that,  but the oral sex?  Yeah.  And what pregnant woman  is sitting there  and allowing that to happen?  Her belly's hiding it.  Are they that scared?  He thinks he's hiding  under the belly?  You might feel  a little pressure.  What a creep.  Yeah.  It's forming oral sex  on the women.  Many pregnant 
[03:51:00]  between September  and whatever.  Oh, this goes back  to 2011.  I did not eat a box though.  Yeah, it's so hard  if you're a gynecologist.  You see some awful ones,  but you know the good ones.  Oh, the prize  comes through that door.  You're going to be like,  it's a good day.  Yeah, hey look,  Becky wants to come back in.  All right,  cancel Mrs. Thompson.  Cancel all my appointments.  Mrs. Thompson  has one lip longer  than the other.  Is Mildred still out  in the waiting room?  Make her wait. 
[03:51:30]  Yes.  Hell's going to be a while.  Not today, Blanche.  Yes, tell Mildred  that Lexus  has an emergency.  Upper East Side.  Upper East Side.  Jeez Louise.  He's charged  with two counts  of forcible touching.  What the fuck?  There's a guy in L.A.,  the gynecologist,  who's everybody,  they call him  like the hot doctor.  Ah, gynecologist  to the start.  Yeah, he's like,  you know,  he's good looking. 
[03:52:00]  They put it all shaped.  They used him  like in different TV shows  like based on his character.  Quincy?  All the women  kind of get into it.  She has a giant clit,  Sam.  Quincy.  They thought it was  a penis when she was born.  The speculum  may be a little cold.  So what happens  with this guy?  I put my hand  and I lost my watch.  I'm just going to  caress her arm  by the boat.  I stuck my 
[03:52:30]  members-only jacket  into a vagina  with one of those  space bags.  Where's my fishing cap?  I'm going to  take a pap smear.  Detective Monaghan,  the murder weapon  in a vagina.  Quincy and me  at your cervix.  Cervix.  He's the lion  from The Wizard of Oz.  Yeah, exactly.  It sounds like that.  A vagina. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, you remember  what's his name?  He's the impression  of the little coward lion.  Oh, I hate that.  That's good, right?  I love it.  Yeah, we should have him  come back in and do it.  You didn't like that?  Put him up, put him up.  Our friend did a really good...  His face looks like  it was convulsing.  He's a good guy.  Come on.  Oh, no.  Who is it?  This guy,  Louis Twitchell Santana,  he's a comedian.  Comedian with Tourette's.  Why haven't we seen him  in so long?  I don't know.  I don't know what happened to him.  He's great.  I love him.  He twitched off  the end of the earth. 
[03:53:30]  Do we do an imitation  of the lion?  Oh, would he ever.  He's a big fan  of The Wizard of Oz.  The whole jump around  thing that he does.  I have it if you want.  Yeah, let's hear it  for a second.  It's pretty good.  What do you got?  Twitchell's doing  Cowardly Lion.  Oh, this is...  I mean, close your eyes.  It's amazing.  I hate this.  I can picture it.  I can picture it.  I can picture it.  I can picture it.  I can picture it.  I can picture it.  Get out of there,  you tin can. 
[03:54:00]  What's your hit me for?  I didn't buy him,  but you tried to.  How gay is this?  Oh, I think I said that.  Look at that.  My same reaction  years later.  I said you are  so fucking gay.  Hang on, I'll replay it.  Huh?  I'll replay it.  No, we ought to do  the video.  We should do it on video,  man.  Come on.  The visual.  Oh, man.  There's somebody in here  to play the video.  It's beautiful. 
[03:54:30]  It is really good.  He's straining his face.  Well, he's got Tourette's  on.  Oh, God.  Andrew on Long Island  is pissed off  about the gynecologist.  He's a physician.  Go ahead, Andrew.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  What kind of physician?  I'm actually a PA,  and I actually called in  a while back  when we had that news story  for the nursing home woman  with the strippers.  All right.  I work in long-term care  and rehab medicine.  But anyway, 
[03:55:00]  I did have to do  a lot of rotations  through gynecology  and obstetrics.  I just want to tell you guys,  that perp switch  you're talking about,  it's true.  Everybody's got it,  but when you're doing  something so medical,  it totally goes away.  It's very, very hard  for it to happen.  I'm sure it does.  Well, listen,  you...  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  You're looking at  a young vagina  in your office,  and you're trying to tell me  you're not turned on  whatsoever.  Maybe you keep it professional,  but somewhere in your head  you're like,  God damn. 
[03:55:30]  God damn.  Everyone thinks about  their work on the way home.  Okay, I'm not going to lie.  I'm not going to sit here  and say,  no, absolutely,  that never happens.  It does,  but you keep it  way, way, way in the back,  and it never comes  to any point  where anything like...  I mean,  this guy going down  on pregnant women,  like, are you kidding me?  Yeah, that's kind of weird,  but...  Did you ever see a girl...  You're supposed to have  another woman  in the room with you  when you're examining  a female patient.  That's the first thing.  I don't know how that got by.  Look, I... 
[03:56:00]  Sexy, a threesome.  Yeah, exactly.  Nice.  I get my skin checked  every year,  and she's a woman,  and she's pretty good looking.  She's in her 40s,  and there was another woman  in the room,  and we were having  small talk,  and then I had to open up  so she could check out  my dick and balls,  and all conversation  in the room stopped.  It's called smaller talk.  And all conversation 
[03:56:30]  in the room stopped  until, you know,  she covered it up again,  and then we went back  to small talk,  and I'm thinking to myself,  all right, right on, man.  She was fucking turned on  for a fucking split second.  Whoa!  Whoa!  There's no doubt  out of my mind!  Yeah.  But she kept it professional,  but she gets to look  at dick and balls all day.  Wow.  But on the other side of it,  did you get a rod  when she was looking at you?  No, I didn't get a rod.  Exactly.  But I made sure,  like, I knew it was going down, 
[03:57:00]  so I made sure, you know,  I had a little something going on.  I was taking a Cialis,  so I was half-fired.  Right, I'm not going to,  if I have to present,  I'm not going to make,  I'm not going to allow her  to, you know,  see the sad penis.  You're going to wake him up.  I wasn't going to be turgid,  but I made sure  I was doing okay.  A little something.  A little something.  Did you helicopter  do it really quick  while you were waiting?  Yeah.  Wind it up, yeah.  It's like you did  some manscaping  right before you went  into the office.  No, not really, 
[03:57:30]  but I had no doubt  there was a slight turn-on  that was going on  at that very moment,  but she kept it, obviously,  very, extremely professional.  Sure.  Of course.  But the tell was  when the small talk  stopped for a second.  Right.  Yeah, the small talk  stopped for a second  with her looking at you  and saying,  oh, dear God.  Could she have gone down on you  without you realizing it?  Yeah, exactly.  That's such a bizarre part  of the story.  I was pushing my hips forward.  What would you do  while she was doing it? 
[03:58:00]  She'd put your balls  on her nose  and you're like cock  against her head  and then put her arms out  and made airplane noises.  Meow.  What year of your residency  did you learn this technique?  My dumb...  I appreciate you  taking my part.  Hold on.  My dumb point here  is though that  you're human after all  and there has to be  a turn-on factor,  but you obviously,  like you said,  it puts it way back  in your head  and keep it professional.  Overwritten.  And that's why,  like I said,  you always have to have  another female in the room. 
[03:58:30]  But very, very, very quickly,  I had this one patient  who came in  and like you said,  you know,  if you're going to a,  somebody who's going to be  checking out your junk  or down below,  you want to make sure  everything's nice and clean.  There was one patient  when I was doing  my OB-GYN rotation,  she came in  and she had washed herself  with some like glitter soap  and she was completely,  like,  it almost looked like  she was bedazzled down there.  It was ridiculous.  There you go.  That's a little perk,  a little perk of the job there. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, a perk  and then you have the chlamydia  and the gonorrhea  and all the other things.  That's true.  Oh, even sexy.  But my point is  you deal with all that  knowing that right around  the corner  it could be something  young and fresh.  I don't know what happens  when I have sex  and my vagina  just twitches  and squeezes  so much, doctor.  Oh!  And I'm so wet  all the time.  Oh, that's a shame.  Oh, we're going to, yeah.  Oh, I hope it stops  when I turn 21. 
[03:59:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I like to,  when I have a female doctor  going to check out my junk,  I don't shower  for a couple of days  and then I take my ass sweat  and I rub it all over my dick  and I'm like,  go ahead, baby.  Ceremones.  Oh, God damn.  All right, Andrew.  One last thing.  I just want to say,  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  I saw you on Tuesday morning  and you were fucking phenomenal.  That's all I'm doing.  Oh, nice.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  The tapings went well  for Jimmy's new show on Vice. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, it was amazing.  Amazing, amazing.  That's all I'm going to say.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You can say whatever you want.  Thank you.  I didn't announce guests before  just because people cancel and stuff  so I didn't want anybody  coming to see someone specific.  It was so great  and Jimmy,  you were so hard on yourself  in the beginning  but you did such a fucking great job.  It was a great time.  Nice.  Everybody in the audience  had a great time.  Thank you.  Your guests were phenomenal.  I don't know if you want to say  who the guests were,  but it was great.  I was only kidding  when I was being hard on myself.  I wasn't,  I was just,  you know,  if anything went wrong,  I acknowledged it  but it was really fun  and the crowds were fucking amazing.  It was great, man. 
[04:00:30]  I really wish you all the luck  and I hope this thing takes off.  I'm sure I will.  Thank you, buddy.  Very cool.  Nice.  We got to go to Dan.  He wants in on this gyno talk.  Dan, the man in Pennsylvania.  Good morning, boys.  I got a gross gynecology story.  Awesome.  My best buddy's girlfriend  worked in a gyno's office  and a woman came in  with a questionable odor  that was just intensifying  and it had been around for weeks.  It got worse and worse.  The doctor goes in there 
[04:01:00]  and goes fishing  and he pulls out  a condom  that was just completely  covered in black fungus.  Oh.  It had been inside of her  for several months.  She didn't know about it.  Wow.  She didn't know about it, huh?  And then, like,  they dumped it  in one of those  biohazard things  and it still smelled so bad  they had to call Hazmat  to come clean it up  because no one  would come into the office.  What exactly was the fungus? 
[04:01:30]  It was,  it is just,  like,  the dude,  you know,  came in the condom  and then it came off  and it had been  rotting bacteria  and rotting  and the stuff  decides to start growing.  Necrotizing.  Now,  is her vagina  beyond repair  or how do they get it  to smell regular again?  I have no idea.  I think getting rid  of the condom  was the first,  you know,  the start.  Then you could scrub it  in there.  Probably could do  a little mopping up  after.  Yeah,  you gotta fucking  send it out  out of the refrigerator  eventually.  Like it never happened. 
[04:02:00]  Imagine the guy  got some arm and hammer  and I think she,  yeah,  yeah,  a little douche.  That wasn't a nice story.  No.  No,  that's a rough one.  It was a gross story.  That's one that you don't want.  You get these in condoms.  Yeah,  right?  I should have said,  yeah,  we should have asked  what's a condom.  What's a condom?  What's a condom?  The fungus was on what?  Let's say hi  to Jake in California.  Jake.  Hey,  what's going on,  guys?  Hey,  Jake.  Hey,  I'm actually doing  my rotation right now  in the OBGYN. 
[04:02:30]  Oh.  Like you're talking  about that whole  switch getting turned on,  you know how hard it is  to turn that bad boy on  after you've seen  chlamydia  and nasty  blue waffle down there.  Oh,  so like when you're  with a hot girl,  then you start thinking  like,  ew,  you remember  disgusting stuff?  Nah,  it's not.  We're not going to.  I mean,  you watch your wife  have babies and stuff  and I mean,  you know,  it's for a second  and it's totally different.  I hate Brussels sprouts,  so let's say I'm forced  to eat a few Brussels sprouts, 
[04:03:00]  but then all of a sudden  the ice cream comes,  my palate's fine.  Right,  exactly.  What are you talking about?  You get over that  quickly when there's  a fresh,  nice one in front of you.  That's the really old  Brussels sprouts.  In a taco.  Yeah,  exactly.  Try eating Brussels sprouts  with a herpes sore on them.  I think my point is  you turn around quickly.  Yeah.  You can turn that shit  around quickly.  Yeah,  yeah.  Thank you,  sir.  Let's go to Matt  and Ken,  Ken,  Ken,  Ken,  Ken,  Ken,  Ken,  Ken,  Ken, 
[04:03:30]  Ken,  Ken,  Ken,  Ken,  Ken,  I'm trying to say it  how Ann says it.  Matt,  go ahead.  Hey,  boys.  Hey,  when I was in  elementary school,  one of my friends,  his dad went to jail,  he was a massage therapist  and I guess he got busted  because he just buried his face  in this girl's ass  and he claimed he dropped his gum.  He dropped his gum  in her asshole  and was trying to get it  like bobbing for him.  He tried to just bury his nose  right in her ass  and just claimed that he dropped  his gum in her ass.  That switch went off.  He had a perv switch  we're talking about. 
[04:04:00]  He had to put his face in her ass.  Yep.  He was looking at that ass  doing the massage  and he's like,  I've got to shove my face in there.  I can't not do this.  Yes.  Yes.  Right.  All right.  Let me say hi to Jimmy  in Staten Island.  Jimmy.  Hi,  Jimmy.  When did you leave?  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  Well,  I had a customer of mine.  He was a gynecologist  for like 50 years.  Very well known.  And I asked him,  how did you do it  for so long?  He just listened.  Sometimes you see  some pretty ones,  but sometimes you see  some real nasty ones.  And then my brother asked him,  but when you went down there,  didn't you ever just want to say, 
[04:04:30]  Pinocchio!  Pinocchio!  Watch it down.  Jimmy?  And that ends our phones.  That's how it ends.  It was going well there  for a little bit.  I'm kind of missing  the fungus story now.  Yeah,  yeah.  Well,  yeah.  That's what happens when you...  We got an update  on the DMV story.  Was that that girl guy?  Yeah,  what was the...  Guy girl?  What was he,  she again?  Gender confused  or gender... 
[04:05:00]  There was no confusion  at all.  He was a gender  non-conforming teen.  Gender non-conforming teen.  That's Tom Papa.  A lot of labels.  A lot of new labels  you've got to learn.  That's what a dad wants  to hear his son  come up and tell him.  What did we have  growing up?  Hey, dad,  I made the varsity  ball team.  Oh, good.  You know,  something like that.  And then the other  son comes up and,  hey, dad,  I'm gender fucking...  I don't have a clue.  I'm a gender non-conformist.  A gender non-conformist.  That would be  for a dad, maybe?  When we were growing up,  Sam, 
[04:05:30]  I think we had  boy and girl.  That was it.  Those are the only two?  I swear,  I think so.  Male, female,  that's it.  Boy and girl.  I think we had two labels.  For real.  That's crazy.  Did we have a third label  growing up?  It was it.  What about a boy,  girl,  queebque?  No, it was a boy  and a girl.  No queebque,  nothing.  Wow.  That was it, right?  That was it.  Yeah.  When we were sitting there  with our vinyl.  Yes.  Now, though,  you know...  There's so many new labels.  So many new ones.  So you had this kid 
[04:06:00]  go into the DMV  and he has makeup on  because he wears  his makeup every day  and they said  you've got to remove  the makeup  if you want your  driver's license photo taken.  Oh.  So there's a lot of outrage.  Because there's a rule  that says that  you can't go in there  wearing any makeup  that would alter  your face  or make you look different  for the...  Oh, there's the kid.  But it's for changing  your look...  It's a disguise.  Like on purpose.  A disguise.  That's not a disguise.  That's not, though.  The makeup is subtle enough 
[04:06:30]  where you can tell  either way  that this was the person.  I mean,  you really can't enforce that  because then you're saying  that every woman...  Yeah.  They look totally different  without the makeup.  Every woman, yeah.  Take your makeup off.  No.  Right.  Like, yeah.  Or if a guy has a beard  and then shaves the beard off.  Right.  You know, he's going to look different  but they don't make you  go in there without a beard.  That's true.  Right.  So it's very, very odd.  Life is so confusing.  Mila Kunis  with her makeup off.  Her disguise. 
[04:07:00]  That is so bad.  That is the worst pick of it.  So, yeah.  It's all an illusion.  Tori Spelling.  Some girls,  when they take off  their eye makeup,  they look like they're blind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tori Spelling  without makeup  looks like Edgar Winter.  Yes.  As a matter of fact,  every blonde actress  looks like Edgar Winter.  Oh, my God.  Coley Hawn without makeup.  Yikes.  It's a lot to put on your face.  Yeah.  I'm going to put my face on that.  It looks like they have rat eyes  or something.  Beyonce, pretty much the same. 
[04:07:30]  Yes.  She's a little more ethnic.  Oh, my God.  Reba, not so much.  Oi.  Reba.  She has hair and everything.  Damn.  Yeah, it's all an illusion.  They don't look like they look.  Is Marilyn Manson still an idiot?  Do we have an update on Marilyn Manson?  Is he still an idiot?  He's acting in something now.  He's not a size of advocate.  Right.  Okay, so.  That's pretty good.  Anyway, we got an update.  The DMV says staff did nothing wrong 
[04:08:00]  by refusing to take picture of boy with makeup.  Nothing wrong by refusing.  Oh.  If your name is David Jones  and it says you are a male,  then you should look like a male.  Wow.  South Carolina DMV spokeswoman Beth Parks  told the Daily News.  South Carolina.  So I guess by that point,  sorry to interrupt you,  but if a woman comes in  and she's very butch  and she's a lesbian,  I guess do they make her grow her hair  to look more quote-unquote feminine?  Like, yeah.  What a dumb thing to say.  That looks like a girl. 
[04:08:30]  Parks says the workers did  what they are required to do  and were just following DMV policy.  At no time will an applicant be photographed  when it appears that he or she  is purposely altering his or her appearance  so that the photo would misrepresent  his or her identity.  But that's the policy.  If that's the way this kid looks all the time,  then what's the difference?  He's not misrepresenting.  He's very pretty.  Very pretty.  He could be misrepresenting.  He's a fucking eight and a half.  And he has an eight and a half. 
[04:09:00]  That makes him a ten.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Okay, then Michael Silverman.  He's the director of,  there's a new group,  the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund.  That's great.  They want to be known as T-L-D-E-F.  It's too many letters.  Fit that on a t-shirt.  Yeah, they have too many letters.  Just say Transgender Legal Defense Fund. 
[04:09:30]  That's easier to remember than all the other stuff.  It's not the DMV's job to decide  how boys should look and how girls should look.  Chase is who he is  and wearing makeup is part of who he is.  He is not trying to conceal his identity.  In fact, he is expressing his identity.  If you wear makeup that alters you,  prosthetic pieces on your face  to make you look like someone else,  then I can understand it.  But that's just makeup like any girl would wear.  Yeah, we agree with Mr. Silverman.  Yeah. 
[04:10:00]  All right, whatever.  It continues.  Show a picture of Chase in full makeup.  Oh, is that Chase?  That's it.  Oh, okay.  He doesn't look much different.  No, he really doesn't.  What a femmy-looking boy.  Well, come on.  He's fucking working here.  You know, it's something about Chase.  Sammy pointed at you.  No, I know.  I'm just picturing Sammy  clean-shaven, a little makeup,  a little liner.  You're a femmy.  You're a femmy.  Fucking Sammy looked like Coco  when she was taking her top off.  It probably was less policy  than just some... 
[04:10:30]  Asshole, yeah.  ...just some DMV workers  just tired and just like,  oh, hell no.  Nah.  No, you're not coming in here  and makeup on.  Take that makeup off your face?  Hell no.  Well, the DMV broad,  she says it's much simpler than that.  His identity is a boy, she said.  I speak for the agency,  not for myself.  This is agency policy.  I can't have a personal opinion on this.  This is not a heart issue.  It's a legal issue.  Park says that the DMV  might be more lenient  if someone has surgery  to make them a different sex 
[04:11:00]  and go through the courts  to get paperwork  confirming the transition.  But until that happens,  they are still...  They are still are what...  Wow, that's what she said?  They are still are what they are.  They are still are what they are.  Life is so confusing now.  You can't legally be a boy.  Boy is not a legal...  No, but in a way,  as much as she's hateable,  once you go through...  If you're going to change  or do something like...  I don't know.  But he doesn't want to be female.  Yeah, I kind of lost my confidence.  No, I think it's really simple. 
[04:11:30]  I mean, if an officer pulls this kid over  and whether he has makeup on or not,  you can tell it's the person  on the driver's license.  That's all that should matter.  He has common sense.  Like Ann said,  but if the makeup is such  where it really drastically changes...  It's everything Ann was saying.  I'm on the same page.  I think if you really think about  what that regulation is,  they obviously mean  if you wear some type of  SNL Joe Piscopo 
[04:12:00]  wants to look like  Frank Sinatra makeup.  You know, and that.  Not a, you know,  some very...  We've lost tastefully applied  blush and eyeshadow.  Exactly.  We've lost common sense  in this country.  Yeah, we did.  There's no common sense.  Because people are afraid  to use common sense  and then apply it to something.  Everyone needs a rule book  that has black and white.  Those are the issues.  I need to know exactly  what someone has told me  to do in this situation 
[04:12:30]  so I don't have to think  and make a decision  because I might get  called out on that decision.  So now it's like,  oh, no makeup means no makeup.  No.  Use your head.  But to play the other side of it,  when people do use common sense,  they get fucked sometimes.  That is true, too.  Again, you've got to balance  all that shit out.  So they're like,  what does policy say  and I'm following policy?  Policy is right.  Policy, I say.  You could quote me on that.  Can't a boy put on  a little blush now and again?  Right.  Oh, man, what my dad 
[04:13:00]  would have said about that.  Exactly.  What the hell is going on?  Anthony, are you with him again?  Although Richard probably  could have put makeup on like that  and looked very girly.  Guys, Jimmy's back.  What?  He's very mad at us.  Uh-oh.  Jimmy's back from Staten Island.  Uh-oh.  I know we all forgot about him,  but go ahead, Jimmy.  All right.  First of all,  it all can't be radio gold.  Okay?  At least I had the decent  to know what to punch out.  It can't all be radio gold.  He's critiquing his appearance. 
[04:13:30]  You better let me by my voice.  Listen,  you know how many times  I listen to the same stuff  droning over and over,  but I wait with anticipation,  hoping something will come down,  and 99% of the times it does.  Don't persecute me  because one day  He was the Pinocchio guy.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought that was a good one.  Look, you swung and missed.  Yeah, big time.  I was also a Christmas light guy, too.  We remember you  as Christmas light guy.  We like you as Christmas light guy.  Remember him during Christmas  talking about the lights? 
[04:14:00]  We like you as Christmas light guy.  The bulbs.  You put the bulbs in.  I remember.  This guy will sell you  Christmas lights in a parking lot, Tom.  I remember this guy.  No, it wasn't that,  you dumb skie.  Listen.  Did you count the plugs this year?  Did you count the plugs this year?  After what I said,  did you count the plugs  to make sure you don't empty boxes?  Right, so you're not getting  the empty boxes.  Right.  That's what I did.  I didn't tell you  like this fucking Lowe's parking lot.  Right.  I thought you sold him  in a parking lot.  I don't know.  Who am I? 
[04:14:30]  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, yeah, jerk.  All right, we'll catch you next time.  You'll come back strong next time.  Don't worry about it.  Hey, don't worry about it.  Hey.  Relax.  That Pinocchio joke was awful.  No, it was terrible.  Not only did he swing and miss,  but the bat flew out of his hand  and struck a toddler.  Yeah, we had to stop going to the phones.  It was that bad.  Did you hear the update  or the 911 call for... 
[04:15:00]  The sitch?  For the sitch  and his brother fighting  at the tanning salon?  Look, man,  the man reached out to me  on Twitter yesterday.  The man?  And now he's playing fucking games.  Hard to guess.  I told the man  I was too busy taking a dump,  but I will tell Roland.  Yeah.  And because the man  gave his email address out.  So I told the man,  I said,  look,  we want you on the show today.  Today.  Today.  We're not messing around  with publicists  and all that horseshit  when they're scheduled  to do promotion  for the new show. 
[04:15:30]  Yeah, what am I,  a schmuck on wheels?  He obviously wants  some publicity,  so I said,  come in today.  Obviously he wants publicity  because they had a fight  at the tanning salon,  punched each other  in the face.  Well,  I just want to give you  the update.  So Roland emails  the man  because I told Roland  he's going to,  you know,  you should email the man.  Yeah.  And now the man  is going through  a publicist  telling Roland,  and we'll get,  you know,  get a hold of my publicist.  So guess what?  The man either  comes on our show Monday  or it's over. 
[04:16:00]  Over.  We're not doing,  you know,  an official publicity tour  with the publicist  and all that shit.  And yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  You come on the show  Monday or that's it.  Man,  come on like you were  booked by fake Roland.  That's what I say.  Man up.  Well,  Tom,  you got the situation,  right?  Yeah.  And he's going to do  a reality show  with his two brothers  and his sister.  And one of his brother's  nickname,  which obviously  he gave himself,  is the man.  It's tattooed on his arm.  And he has nine cars  with license plates  that are the man 
[04:16:30]  one through nine.  I bet he says this a lot.  Who's the man?  And he points at himself.  Hey, you the man.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm the man.  You are.  And he's got a tattoo,  too,  the man.  Yes.  You know what  the man's tattoo says?  The man.  The man.  That's right.  I said that.  And yeah.  So anyway,  we got the situation's  911 call.  But if you listen  to this 911 call  and you don't understand  that this is  completely fabricated  and they did this  for publicity  for this fucking  reality show  because no one,  first of all,  would call 911  for this. 
[04:17:00]  For this.  For this situation.  And the way it sounds,  it's...  But the situation  was bloodied up  a little bit.  They probably  punched each other  on purpose  to get the marks  and stuff on them.  They're all in,  right,  on this.  Right.  All in.  So this is the 911 call?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Where's your emergency?  I'm a customer  at Boca Tanning  and Mike,  the owner,  is here  and him and his brother  are in a fight  with, like,  family trying to  pull it apart  in the back.  Where are they? 
[04:17:30]  Inside the store  or behind the store?  Yeah, they're inside  the store  in the back  of the store  inside.  And how many people  are fighting?  I don't know.  I just know  it's Mike  and his brother,  Frank.  Mike and his brother,  Frank.  There's girls screaming.  I just brought them  together.  The girls at the front  desk just asked me  to call.  All right.  Just hold on one second.  Why wouldn't the girls  have the desk call?  Right.  All right.  Don't go in.  I don't know.  They're like,  this would be a great idea.  Yeah, and then we'll get  the cops.  I don't know. 
[04:18:00]  Black guys?  Oh, brothers.  The people next door  at UPS heard the scream  and then they walked  over while I was  calling.  Hold on.  This guy's like,  fuck, what do I have  to deal with this shit?  I don't know.  What's your name?  Oh, do I have to say it?  Huh.  What?  What? 
[04:18:30]  He's pissed.  What?  Do you know if they have  any weapons or anything?  I have no idea.  I just walked out.  They started screaming  and I walked out  the front to call you  because I didn't want  anybody to hear me  calling you.  Why?  Did you actually see  them fist fighting?  I looked back  and there's girls screaming  and they're all down  the hallway  and my sister's here  and the girlfriend's here.  Did you see them  fighting, he asked you?  Did you actually see  them fist fighting?  Thank you.  So why would you 
[04:19:00]  then go out  and call the cops?  It could be over.  He hates her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're a liar.  You're a liar.  I know these calls.  You're a liar.  I think this cop's annoying.  Do you still hear them  yelling or anything?  Did you hear them  yelling still? 
[04:19:30]  The UPS lady is from  the court.  She's like they were  bouncing off her wall.  Like I said,  I'm just the one  that made the call  because I had to call you.  Bloodinsky.  This is all, you know.  A big fraud.  She was told to call.  Yeah.  Drum it up.  So we fought.  Right.  Look, I'm going to stand here.  You punched me in the fucking eye.  Punch me in the fucking eye.  Come on, do it.  Tell me your fights work.  It worked on our other show.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how you do it.  Exactly.  Snooze.  Mm-hmm.  Is it still going? 
[04:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, probably half over.  A little more than half over.  Snooze.  A little more.  A little more?  Yeah.  Okay.  I have no idea.  A few cars going over there.  Okay, thank you.  Just let me know  if they come outside  or anything like that  or if we, you know.  Okay.  If you hear anything else,  you know.  Okay.  Oh my God,  they have guns.  Boy, this is the  least dramatic  911 call.  Yeah, 911 call.  Trying to get something going. 
[04:20:30]  It really is.  Hey, action.  Still nothing happening  over here.  What was that?  The sister  and the girlfriend  are outside.  Does she know  who everybody is?  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Oh, the sister.  She knew that it was,  you know,  Mike and Frank,  but I'm just,  I was just in there.  I ran out.  I just don't know anything.  I'm just a,  come on. 
[04:21:00]  The executive producer  told me to.  She's bringing at the door  next door to the UPS.  I can just hear the screaming.  Okay.  I can hear the screaming.  Someone almost here.  I'm about to have a word.  There should be  an officer out there  in a non-marked car.  You see that?  No.  You should be pulling in.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  I'm so stressed out  by the stuff  that's not happening.  I don't see it here  or anything,  but oh my God.  Stay right here.  I'll send up 
[04:21:30]  a plume of my hairspray  so the officer  could see it.  Just let him know  that you were the caller.  Okay?  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  He wanted that.  And then the big  That was terrible.  Good for that guy.  Because there's nothing  going on.  What is TMZ  saying on their Twitter  about it?  Are they asking questions?  I'm sure.  What do you think?  Are you?  Oh, they're trying  to get to the bottom of it.  What's your idea  of what happened?  What do you think?  They have a style.  He likes his fault. 
[04:22:00]  He likes asking questions,  Harvey.  What's the question  on this one?  Oh, here's one question.  This is indifferent.  Did you guys see  that Melanie Griffith  covered up  her tattoo?  Right.  It used to say  Antonio with a heart on it.  Right.  She lasered off  the Antonio part.  Oh, no.  Right.  So here's the tweet.  Melanie Griffith  covers up Antonio tattoo  with makeup  on the red carpet.  Yeah.  Do you think  it's a jab at Antonio?  Huh.  Let me think.  With all the knowledge 
[04:22:30]  I have of this situation.  Holy shit.  Let me put in  my two cents.  That's a...  Oh.  Yeah.  Malia Obama  fetched coffee  for Holly's crew.  Yeah, she's working  on a set.  Welcome to Hollywood.  Right.  Yeah.  Surprise,  she didn't get  special treatment?  I sure am.  Uh, yes.  Retweet, retweet, retweet.  Yes.  No, I mean, no.  I said yes,  but I meant no.  Holly's crew,  who's Holly?  Holly Berry?  Oh, of course.  Holly.  Because it's an easy gig  to get,  just, you know, 
[04:23:00]  Halle Berry's fucking...  Exactly, right?  You don't get near  Halle Berry.  Unless you're  Obama's daughter.  Right.  Special treatment.  What are the latest tweets?  Oh, Aaliyah.  Yeah.  Her family vows  to torpedo  an upcoming biopic.  Okay.  Should they stop production?  Why or why not?  I don't know.  Biopic.  Show your work.  Biopic.  Watch the video  and tell us what you think.  Why is there a problem?  Why should they stop production?  How am I supposed  to answer this  when I don't know  what the family's problem 
[04:23:30]  is with the biopic?  Gay.  It's biopic.  It's biopic.  Biopic.  Biopic.  Biopic.  Biopic.  Biopic.  I thought it was  a biographical picture.  That's what it is.  Biopic.  Biopic sounds like  you know  I have two eyes  I am biopic.  Biopic.  That would be a biopic.  Or maybe you need an opic  and one is for sale.  Maybe I like both  sexes of opics.  Yeah, or a pic. 
[04:24:00]  Yes.  No more questions today.  He's light on the questions, huh?  I have to leave.  Why?  Oh.  Should Tom Papa leave?  Tell us what you think.  Why not?  How dare you leave?  Let us know what you think.  Why do you think Tom Papa's leaving?  Are you in trouble with the show?  I gotta tell you, if he leaves, I leave.  So, fuck that.  Don't you guys leave now?  I...  Well, no, Tom, but...  You used to leave at 10.  If you're leaving, we're leaving.  If, yeah, I'm not gonna...  You gotta leave.  I shall not sit around here without the likes of Tom Papa to entertain me. 
[04:24:30]  It's so good to be back and see you guys.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Stress Factory, tomorrow and Saturday nights.  Yes.  That's a great club, obviously.  We love Vinny's Place.  Good shows.  Come on down.  What's the number over there?  7-5-7?  7-3-2-5-4-5.  Ha-ha.  Ha.  4-2-4-2.  Nice.  Right, right, right.  Ha.  And Tom Papa on the Twitter.  On the Twitter.  Nice.  And you got that thing on Tuesday, right?  Yeah, Tuesday at the Village Underground here in New York with Jim Norton and Jim Brewer 
[04:25:00]  and Ted Alexandra.  It's a big radio show, taping, if you want to come to that.  Is that underground, though?  Because I'm very afraid of a cave-in.  Where are the exits?  I need to know.  Where are the exits?  But, um, I'll be back as soon as my wife ends my career.  Oh, my God.  Sounds horrible.  Try to make her happy.  Yeah.  I'm doing what I can.  Okay.  All right.  We're out of here. 
[04:25:30]  All right.  All right.  Jimmy's got plugs.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Sorry, Jimmy.  West Palm Beach, July 10 through 12.  Love that club.  And I haven't been there since 2009.  It's a nice room.  So I'm sure I'll have, hopefully, the same amount of people.  I think it's the Jizu Theater.  Somebody said I'm saying it wrong in Montreal, July 26.  And then Cobbs in San Francisco.  August 7, 8, 9.  Another great day.  And then Addison Improv, August 21 through 23.  Nice.  Bravo.  All right.  Have a great time.  Yeah.  See you, fellas.  All right, Tom.  Great seeing you, buddy. 
[04:26:00]  Great seeing you.  Absolutely.  We've got to make believe we don't talk when the mics are off.  So good seeing you.  See you next time.  There he goes.  All right.  Bye.  We're leaving.  The Opie and Anthony show has gone to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments of today's show.  Sam Roberts, Opie and Anthony post show begins in moments.  If you're overwhelmed by debt and thinking about going to a credit counseling company for help, think again. 
[04:26:30]  Because the majority of those companies actually work for the credit card companies.  And they make the credit card companies a lot of money from people just like you.  But there's another way out of debt, and it's not bankruptcy.  A way to reduce your debts and save you thousands of dollars.  Even better, you can find out how for free by calling 1-800-508-1037.  At Freedom Debt Relief, we're not a credit counseling organization. 
[04:27:00]  We're not a debt consolidation company.  We offer a unique alternative to save you the most money possible to resolve your debt in the shortest amount of time.  If you're thinking about a credit counselor, ask yourself this.  Are they working for you or the credit card companies?

[04:27:30]  I'm Victor Khaleesi, Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities.  And I'm Bill Bratton, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department.  MOPD works to assure that people with disabilities can enjoy the rich opportunities our city has to offer.  This includes the freedom to travel throughout New York City, a right most of us take for granted.  For people with disabilities, traveling around the city can become a challenge when drivers fail to follow basic parking rules.  New York City's parking regulations protect the rights of people with disabilities.  When you violate parking regulations, you not only violate the law, you violate the rights of others. 
[04:28:00]  Parking spaces designated for people with disabilities ensure equal access to goods and services.  Parking without a permit in a designated space or using a fake permit is illegal.  Any car parked illegally in a space designated for a person with disabilities will be ticketed and subject to tow.  The fine is $180.  So do the right thing and save yourself money and hassle.  Respect the right of every New Yorker to accessible transportation.

[04:33:00]  Unfortunately, the O.P. and Anthony show is over.  Fortunately, we have a hard time letting go.  The story is behind the story.  The story is the backstage drama.  Everything that made today unforgivable.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW now.  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show. 
[04:33:30]  Post Show with Sam Roberts.  Welcome, welcome, welcome.  Wrapping up the week with this live O.P. and Anthony Post Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  You can be a part of this thing.  It was a big show.  Tom Papa.  Back on the show for the first time in a long time.  He's been out in L.A. where he's been trying to maintain a career.  Even though his wife wants no part of being there. 
[04:34:00]  That's a complicated situation.  You gotta feel for that guy.  But he was also getting into the World Cup and everything.  We went over the Redskins deal.  Japan finally outlawing child porn.  I loved, loved the vinyl discussion that we got into today.  That's the way you discuss vinyl on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  And of course, Eric Nagel returning.  After much mystery.  But, with all that going on, let's find out what today's line of the day was. 
[04:34:30]  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  And we were having small talk, and then I had to open up so she could check out my dick  and balls, and all conversation in the room stopped.  It's called smaller talk. 
[04:35:00]  There it is.  Smaller talk.  E-Rock, you're smiling.  I thought there were some better lines.  You did?  Yeah, I thought so.  Well, what was your...  Give me one of...  What did E-Rock pull for?  Or...  Did E-Rock pull that one, or was that...  Yeah, I pulled that one.  Okay, what else did E-Rock pull?  He pulled two of them.  Hold on, one second.  Let me grab the other one.  And how come nobody's on the phones today?  I think Adrian's on the phones.  I'm just watching line one ring and ring and ring.  They just want to get picked up, and nobody will do it for him. 
[04:35:30]  Let's see what E-Rock's line of the day was that he's not happy wasn't...  Because that was a good joke.  You give that.  That was a good line.  That's why I pulled it.  That's why you pulled it.  But you thought maybe there were other lines of the day.  Yes.  Oh, God, they're tracking footprints.  There seem to be two sets, one very close to the other one.  Wives look like dads, and they're headed towards the men's room.  That was a great...  That was.  That whole segment was great.  Just breaking down the Brady Bunch. 
[04:36:00]  It's always the same jokes.  Because that's all they go to.  But it's always funny.  It is.  Is that the one?  No, that wasn't the one, but that was a good one as well.  I didn't even honestly see the other ones were here, Eric.  I only saw two.  All right, here's probably a good one.  And I like Jack White's music.  You don't like vinyl sound.  No one cares that much.  It's the same shit.  There's probably a hundred people in America that really do like vinyl sound, and you're  not one of those.  Okay, that made a lot of us laugh. 
[04:36:30]  You know, you know, whenever Sal pulls line of the day in there, and there's an E-Rock  line, makes it every time, without fail.  And I pointed that out to you before.  Whenever there's an E-Rock joke in there, a hundred percent is line of the day, right?  Yeah, usually, yeah.  There's a Sal line in there, and mysteriously, you're like, oh, I didn't even see that one  was there.  In all honesty...  Well, that's what E-Rock always does.  He always deletes the stuff that's negative about him out of the system.  Oh, I didn't even see it.  I guess I deleted it by mistake. 
[04:37:00]  I don't know.  In all honesty, I probably would have pulled that one.  I just didn't...  It wasn't in the folder loading.  Do you believe him, Eric?  I don't know.  He may not have seen it.  I'll give him that.  Oh, my...  Eric, you're such a sucker.  Do you think...  Even if it were true, do you think Sal would give you the benefit of a doubt for a second?  Fuck no.  Sam, in all honesty, I could show Eric the folder.  Look.  Why, I wouldn't have seen that.  Let me go to Frank in the Bronx.  What's up, Frank?  What's up, kid?  Great, great line of the day.  I just want to tell you, I don't know what it is. 
[04:37:30]  Maybe after you came back and there was no change to the studio, you got a little hop  in your step there, young fella.  You're bringing a lot to the table the last few shows.  Me?  Yeah.  What's going on?  I like it.  I like it.  Oh, all right.  I don't know.  I guess I just got something to say, right?  Yeah, but try to keep it a little shorter next week.  All right, I'll talk to you later, Frank.  Slabo's back.  Did you hear the segment this week where we were trying to figure out where you were? 
[04:38:00]  I didn't hear anything this week.  I've heard of, but I have not heard.  I called, I literally, I called two hotels in Italy.  Like, somebody's going to get a long distance bill, because we, from the phone screen room,  we call hotels in Italy.  I got to hear an Italian man, because they don't speak English.  Did you know that?  In Italy?  Yeah.  No, I had no idea.  All of them, Italian, all of them.  But there was the one English person, speaking person at the hotel.  I got to hear a hotel person run down a list of names going, Nagel, Nagel, Nagel, 
[04:38:30]  in his Italian accent, but I called, we called as a show, the hotel in Florence that you were at,  the day after you checked out of it.  Oh, no, they check out yesterday.  Good.  Because I remember, you know what I did?  What?  I remember what happened the last time Opie and Anthony ruined your vacation,  and I asked for your wife's name as well.  Right.  And that's where I found it, and they were like, no, they checked out yesterday.  That wasn't under my wife's name.  They had your wife's name, I don't know.  No, there's family with that name.  Oh, that's what, oh, can you imagine? 
[04:39:00]  You would have got somebody else's room.  You might call your aunt or something.  Yeah, you would have got, well, yeah, you would have got cousins or aunts or something like that.  That would have been great.  How many people went with you?  Uh, eight.  And how come you lied, you straight out lied to the people around you about where you were going?  Actually, no, I didn't.  I figured you were going to come back and say, well, I went to Florida first, and then I went to...  No, no, I never said Florida initially.  Roland just kept assuming, so I went with it.  So when he kept saying it, he's like, so you're going down to Florida to see your brand?  And I just went, yes.  Right?  That's a lie. 
[04:39:30]  No, I wasn't saying, I'm going to Florida.  But he said, are you going to Florida?  And you said, yes.  To him, yes.  The correct answer was...  And then when Travis asked me, and I just went, yes.  Okay.  But I didn't tell anybody I was going to Florida, and I didn't tell you where I was going.  No, no, no, no.  But we said, are you going to Florida?  And you said...  Yes.  And the truthful answer was...  No.  Okay, so that would be the lie.  No, if he's deceiving, it wouldn't be the lie.  No, it's a full 100% lie.  Like, you have to at least own up to the fact that, yes, you 100% lied about where you were going. 
[04:40:00]  All right, fine.  You did.  And was that just because you didn't want to have your vacation ruined again?  Yeah, pretty much.  That was it?  Yeah.  Because, I mean, and it was one of those things where it was like, you know, we got all caught up in it.  And I was like, yeah, the staff doesn't like to be lied to.  Oh, well.  Well, but then people were like, well, didn't Ant call him on his vacation to make whale noises?  And I was like, yeah.  And didn't Obi give out his cell phone number the last time he...  Right.  Yeah, he did do that. 
[04:40:30]  And called up my parents' house and...  Who called your parents' house?  You guys.  Really?  Yeah.  When?  Years ago.  Called my parents' house.  Sam, did you know we called his parents' house once?  No, I had no idea.  Isn't that great?  What'd your parents think of us calling your parents' house?  I don't remember.  I was pissed, though.  It was a while...  It was like 6.30, so I wasn't expecting to be up.  And then the phone rings, and we pick it up, and my mom goes, it's the show.  So I was like, oh.  Were you mad when you first found out you didn't know what was said, you didn't know what we had done? 
[04:41:00]  Were you mad when you realized that we'd find out you were in Italy?  No.  Apprehensive?  A little apprehensive.  I was a little curious to where it was going to go.  Right.  But, no, I wasn't mad when you found out I was in Italy.  I was already gone.  Right, but...  And you found out way later than you should have, anyway.  Well, because we didn't think about it.  We were like, yeah, he's in Florida.  And then Opie came on the show one day and said, I think he's in Italy.  And everybody went, what?  Yeah.  Because it was a big mystery. 
[04:41:30]  I just didn't tell anybody.  No, I mean, I understand it, but...  It wasn't alluding in vagueness or anything like that.  It's just like, I didn't say a word.  No, no, no, you lied.  No, I lied when I asked where I was going, but I did not say a word about my trip.  Which is vagueness.  That's not vague.  It's not vague if you don't bring it up.  I guess it's just...  Giving you a direct answer, yes or no, is not being vague.  You're right, it's just lying.  It's just lying.  You were deceitful.  Yeah, that's what I said earlier, too.  And you said, no, it's lying.  All right, all right, we can...  Well, that's the same thing.  Yeah, but you corrected me on it. 
[04:42:00]  I'm just pointing that out.  No, because you said, no, I didn't lie, I was deceitful.  And I said, well, you lied, it's the same thing.  And then we agreed.  All right, whatever.  So you weren't vague this time.  Potato, patata.  Right, exactly.  But so were you a little like, were you nervous about the fact that, okay, they know I'm in Italy now.  I was expecting you guys to call, too.  Like, I didn't get calls from you.  Right.  But when I got off the plane yesterday, I had, like, weird stuff show up on my voicemail.  Right.  And it's random chunks of you not talking to me, it's just the show on voicemail. 
[04:42:30]  Interesting.  Like, you must have had the line on hold.  Yeah, we did.  We tried to call you a couple times.  You know what did you in?  You know what the smoking gun was?  You.  Right.  In all your genius-osity.  The browser thing?  Yeah, you looked up vacation stuff.  Yeah, and some of those hotels I wasn't at.  But the one in Florence, you were.  Oh, that one I was, yeah.  That's how we got the number.  Yeah.  I mean, because you were looking up hotels while the show was on.  So, we were just able to look through your browser history and find it.  That's fine.  It was funny.  Here, look, let me show you what, because I don't know what you guys were talking about. 
[04:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  But, like, there weren't messages to me.  They were just, like, somebody just called my phone and put it on hold.  So, this is your voicemail once you get back stateside?  This is one of them, yeah.  Did you get the sound on, or is it on vibrate?  There it is.  You shoot one person and get arrested, and then you just spend your last day in the phone.  See?  So, it's just, like, little bits of the show.  Right.  You're like, oh, sounds like a good show.  Like, you shoot one person and get arrested, and then you just spend your last day.  It's just, I'm hearing random parts of the show, but there's no messages or anything other than you recorded show parts on my phone. 
[04:43:30]  Well, now you got them for keepsakes.  I do, and delete.  I know.  Not something to listen to.  Snowy in Michigan.  Hey, Samuel.  Hey, welcome back, Eric.  Thank you.  See, lying to them actually kind of worked out for you.  They're insisting that if you were just honest with them and say, don't call me, they wouldn't call you.  Now, that doesn't really work.  That's a lot of bullshit.  Yeah, because...  That's like when I think you owe me an apology.  Yeah, that was one of those things I was thinking about.  Because in my mind, I was like, well, he didn't tell us, so now it creates more of a mystery, so of course we're going to call him. 
[04:44:00]  Which is true.  Yeah.  But then they were like, well, if he had told you, wouldn't you have called him anyway?  And I was like, yeah, I guess in both scenarios, the show would have called Eric's Hotel.  Yeah, I guess that probably would have happened.  Were you told and didn't believe that I was going there?  Somebody wrote, one of my friends wrote me, you said something on there that you knew for a while, but you didn't believe I was going?  No, here's what happened.  Again, my wife had told me a while back that you guys were planning a trip to Italy. 
[04:44:30]  Okay.  And I just said, oh, cool.  And you said I'm going to Florida.  I thought it was two different trips.  That's all that was.  I believed it.  Oh, okay.  I didn't think it was like...  Yeah, all the information I got from people, like I was trying to piece it together, and a lot of it made sense, a lot didn't make sense.  A lot of it made no sense.  No, I believe it wasn't such a far-fetched idea, you know?  And I know that your wife has family and everything in Italy, so it made sense.  But let's go to Jerry from Upstate.  Hey, Prime Time and Slavo! 
[04:45:00]  What's up, Slavo?  Hey, Sammy.  He won't dignify you with a response.  Go on, Jerry.  It was worth a try.  Hey, Sammy, I got a compliment at you, bro.  And since you guys are talking about Jack White, saw him at Governor's Ball at Randall's Island a couple of weekends ago, and he ripped the tits off it.  Normally, I just think you're kind of an evil shit-stir, but I really appreciate your cultural taste there.  He is phenomenal.  Except for the one show that he played at Radio City that Travis went to, that he walked out after 45 minutes. 
[04:45:30]  He is maybe one of the best live performers anywhere in the country.  Anyway, he's amazing.  Yeah, that's like rocking.  Thanks, buddy.  Could you go to Line 5 real quick?  Yes.  I want to point something out with that.  Patrick in Michigan.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Prime Time Sam Roberts.  I didn't know if you guys covered this, but it is a sad day today.  It was one year ago today that James Gandolfini passed away, and I was hoping for a request that you play his last phone call from last year. 
[04:46:00]  His phone call from last year?  The guy that called in, James Gandolfini.  Remember, we had the fake James Gandolfini.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The comedy writer.  Mike Cook.  Yes, that was his name.  We watched his YouTube videos.  He has a great impression.  The reason why I wanted to bring that up was he died in a hotel in Rome, and we went by that hotel, and they told us, no, that was the hotel that he died at.  People go, just like with John Lennon, they go up to the building where he used to live and stand on the stairs or where he got shot and everything. 
[04:46:30]  They're at the hotel getting photos either in front of the hotel or trying to go up to the room that James Gandolfini died at.  It's so creepy.  It's become a weird, unofficial tourist thing.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  That's weird.  There's lines, and they have people at the lobby there.  Are you a guest in the hotel?  No, you cannot be in here, because they're trying to take photos.  And so all day long, they're just getting people who are not guests to leave.  Yeah, I thought it was bullshit, but we went over there, and it was the case.  People were trying to, because the anniversary, like you just said today, was coming up when I was there, and people were trying to get photos of the room that he was in. 
[04:47:00]  Did you go to the, were you staying in the hotel?  Not at that hotel, no.  So you just went to it as well?  It was going on a way to somewhere else.  Oh, so you were just like, let me peek in and see if there's actually a line.  One of the drivers was telling us this was the hotel.  How creepy.  So we stopped there, and there was all these people.  It has a big fountain in front and everything.  If you go to a hotel, and you want to see it, and you're in the lobby, and somebody asks you, are you a guest at the hotel?  You never say no, because they're just, that's, the only reason they're asking you that is so they can kick you out. 
[04:47:30]  Just say, yeah, yeah, I am.  I'm upstairs.  The Boscolo Etcetera Hotel, if I'm saying that right.  When in Italy, stay at the Boscolo.  I was at a good hotel.  If that happened this week, that phone call that that listener is talking about,  maybe we'll play it on a This Week in History segment on the big Sam Roberts Friday show tomorrow.  That goes down at 3 p.m. Eastern, live, here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  I do the Sam Roberts Friday show every Friday, live, here on the Opie and Anthony channel, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern. 
[04:48:00]  I think Hookah and Nicole will probably be stopping by at some point tomorrow.  Guy Pearce.  He's one of the celebrity guests.  Guy Pearce from Memento.  Oh, right, right.  The King's Speech from all these amazing movies.  Very nice.  L.A. Confidential.  Guy Pearce on the show and Jason Biggs with his wife, it girl of the moment, Jenny Mullins.  She's an actress, right?  She's an actress. 
[04:48:30]  She just put out a book that's like everybody's talking about it.  So it's going to be a really good Sam Roberts Friday show tomorrow.  Nice.  Hey, Sam, I have a question.  Uh-huh.  Is it about vinyl?  Because if so, you're the authority.  No, no.  Can we inquire about Iraq's Kabbalah bracelet?  Oh, yeah.  Are you wearing a Kabbalah bracelet?  Yes, I am.  Wait, are you a Kabbalah?  It was given to me.  By who?  By a member of my family.  Are they into Kabbalah?  They are.  Huh.  And I was talking to me at dinner and asked if she could do this, and I said, yes, she could. 
[04:49:00]  And that was it?  That was it.  They gave the prayer and everything that goes with it.  What does that mean for you?  Well, apparently, from what I understand, it means that it wards off something bad happening to you.  Great!  And when it falls off, it means that whatever the threat was to you has ended.  Oh, I see.  So I said, okay.  Are you practicing Kabbalah, like Madge?  I should.  You should?  I should get the, what is that stencil?  Henna?  Yeah, the henna.  Yeah. 
[04:49:30]  Yeah.  But you're not a Kabbalah practicer?  I am not, no.  It's a big celebrity religion.  It's something you might want to think about.  The prayer is the lyrics to Like a Virgin.  That's it, right?  I think it is.  Or Like a Prayer.  Either one.  I guess that would have been better, wouldn't it?  Either one.  Yeah, you should really think about signing up for Kabbalah full time.  That was actually one of the first, because people notice the weirdest things.  When that guy, some fan, when we figured out that Eric was in Italy, randomly the next day some fan found you.  We talked about it on the show earlier this morning. 
[04:50:00]  And when you took the photo with him that ended up on Instagram, and Anthony retweeted it, and we tweeted it at O&A Show, everybody was talking about this red bracelet as if it was a European thing.  Right.  Like, did you read those comments?  I read a few of them.  Yeah, everybody's like, oh, look at this European guy with a red bracelet.  It's like a worldwide religious thing, yeah.  There's nothing European about Kabbalah, but it is very she-she Hollywood.  That I did not know.  Oh, yeah.  I'm glad to be in on it now. 
[04:50:30]  Yeah, I mean, you're walking around.  Like, when I first saw that, I was like, whoa, Eric is stepping up his game a little bit.  Bougie E-Rock.  Yeah.  Maybe he's going to call the paparazzi to start taking pictures of him.  That would be nice.  He's going to take a trip out to L.A. next.  Well, the consumer will have some reviews later.  And by the way, too, I mean, first you're booking travel while the show's on.  All right.  And I'm...  Don't post your vacation pictures while the show is on.  It was topical.  It wasn't topical.  We talked about it.  In the first hour. 
[04:51:00]  Yes.  It was 10 o'clock in the morning, and you're still like, look, I visited the Arc de Triomphe,  or whatever the Italian version of that is.  Don't post...  Anthalon.  Whatever.  St. Peter's Cathedral.  Don't post your vacation pictures while the show's on.  It doesn't make any sense.  It's topical.  At least give people the illusion that you're busy at work.  You know?  Like, just make people believe...  You know, I don't care if you're actually busy, but make...  Give people the benefit of a doubt that you might be busy.  Okay.  You know?  All right.  And say for you, Sal, don't be responding to people on your Twitter about vinyl while 
[04:51:30]  the show's on.  Fuck that guy.  I don't care about that guy.  Let that guy be that guy.  You're supposed to be at work, not tweeting people, fuck you, vinyl's awesome.  No, no.  It's just when people state things as facts and they're 100% wrong, they look like a fool.  Well, Sal was stating a fact.  Vinyl is awesome.  Look, I don't...  You're allowed to.  I don't have a problem with vinyl.  But I don't...  No more personal tweets and Instagrams.  Doesn't make any sense.  Unless it ties into the show, Sal.  Who are you to give Sal instructions?  You think ever since you went Kabbalah, you think you're everybody's boss? 
[04:52:00]  Chris in Indiana.  Hey, afternoon, guys.  Hey, you're gone.  We're down.  New album.  Next month, July 15th.  Yes, I heard.  Of course you heard.  Okay.  Are you studying Kabbalah or Kamala?  Did I hear that wrong?  Did you say Kabbalah or Kamala?  Okay.  It is a Ugandan religion.  It is indeed Kamala.  Or you lose your legs.  That's my mistake.  Ron in Baltimore.  Yeah.  Hey, Kabbalah, no.  It dates all the way back to the time of Solomon.  It's a Jewish thing.  Yeah, but it's... 
[04:52:30]  It actually is the enlightened way and path to life.  No, I know that it is, but I know it's not a new thing, but it's very trendy right now.  It is trendy.  It is, and that's why...  It's trendy everywhere.  It's stupid.  It's trendy.  But, I mean, you're supposed to follow the...  I think it's the nine or eleven ways to God.  Well, I just like that...  I like that Hollywood Eric Nagel has embraced Kabbalah.  It's the first step.  Next, he's going to get some...  I did a heel turn.  Some sponsors.  I'm going to dye my beard black.  I think so.  I think it's just a lot...  It feels a lot more show business in here when you wear that, and I like it. 
[04:53:00]  I like being surrounded by that kind of energy.  Well, you know, you're pretty big yourself.  Maybe you should be getting in on this.  You're right.  Life is a little story.  Yeah, if...  That may be the move I need to take.  It might.  Kabbalah may be my calling, 100%.  This...  Yeah, this feels right.  This is...  Yeah.  Is this from the...  And it feels like home.  Is this a hymn, technically, for Kabbalah?  Does this count as a hymn?  I think it does.  Yeah.  Please open page 325 in your books. 
[04:53:30]  And then it just starts going...  I like it.  I like it.  Well, listen.  It's a little gospel here.  Kabbalah.  This is the gospel of Kabbalah.  Well, Eric, I'm glad that you're back.  I'm glad you're enlightening us.  Sal, I'm glad you could enlighten us to the ways of fidelity today on the show.  Nice.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  Just stop arguing with people on Twitter while the show's on.  It doesn't make any sense.  Fuck that guy.  Understood.  Point and counterpoint.  And everybody, we'll be back for a live Opie and Anthony show on Monday.
