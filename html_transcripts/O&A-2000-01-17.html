<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with chaotic banter before diving into a discussion of a controversial Steel Reserve beer commercial, with the hosts sampling the beer and describing its color as resembling urine.  A caller then recounted a racially charged argument with his wife.  This segued into a discussion of the Greaseman's planned release of racially insensitive crayons with names like "Kink Yellow" and "Homo Pink."  The segment was briefly interrupted by a loud outburst from Mark, a co-worker in the studio.

The show then heavily featured Opie’s recent LASIK surgery. He graphically detailed the procedure, including the sensation of his eyes being "sucked" and the feeling of a "very, very, very, very fine paintbrush" smoothing his corneas.  He described his pre-operative anxiety (relieved by Valium) and his post-operative euphoria, repeatedly emphasizing his dramatically improved vision.  He even symbolically smashed his glasses in celebration.  Multiple callers shared their own experiences with LASIK, with at least one caller stressing the importance of thorough research.

Next, the hosts discussed a 62-year-old blind man who regained some sight via a brain implant, transitioning into a discussion of a double arm transplant and the unsettling implications of having a deceased person's limbs attached to one's body, including humorous, crude speculation about sexual implications.  "Old Dirty," a caller, offered irreverent commentary.  The majority of this segment, however, centered on a lengthy, comedic rant about Earl, a staff member who took an entire day to hang eight pictures.  The hosts, Earl, and other staff members recounted the saga, including repeated rearrangement requests and the excessive time taken.  A comparative picture-hanging exercise was performed with another employee to highlight Earl's slow pace.  Multiple callers, including "Old Dirty," offered humorous and often offensive commentary on Earl's situation.  Earl remained visibly upset at the end of the segment.

The show then shifted to the hosts' reaction to a joke from CBS FM about them and the cloning of twin monkeys.  Opie and Anthony responded by mocking CBS FM DJs using crude, sexually suggestive interjections between songs.  They adopted various outrageous on-air personas, such as "Harry Balls," "Harry Snatch," and "Camel Toe," inserting offensive comments referencing sex acts, underage children, and racial and ethnic stereotypes.  Callers responded with mixed reactions. This segment also included Anthony’s discussing his recent separation and move, including his breaking into his own house to retrieve belongings.

A series of listener calls followed, focusing on divorce, relationship issues, financial settlements, and trust.  Callers shared negative experiences with ex-partners, including property disputes. One caller discussed pressure to get engaged despite trust issues. The show then devoted significant time to the upcoming appearance of The Rock. A WWF representative called to discuss the visit, highlighting anticipation and past tension.  The hosts and callers joked about The Rock potentially assaulting them and played a comedic song titled "Rock's a Pussy."  Other topics included David Letterman's bypass surgery, Star Jones' television appearances, and listeners' opinions on professional wrestling.  The show ended with a humorous segment about a previous broadcast about Harlem, featuring exaggerated and stereotypical depictions.  The hosts expressed nervousness about The Rock’s upcoming interview. Finally, a nonsensical segment featured the repeated phrase "One, two, seven, four."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I'm used to the crazy people.  Oh.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you mental?  No! It's our show!  I'm a madman!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like a stalk-raving mad person.  No! I'm getting hit!  No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No!  O.P. and Anthony.  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane? 
[00:00:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  Three college students in the haunted woods in Maryland.  And now it continues with two DJs in the streets of Harlem.  We're going to bring like a dat recorder and we're going to record our day in Harlem.  It was just supposed to be a goofy radio pitch.  I'll find a tape with you guys later.  That's precisely what happened.  And this is what they found.  What is that?  Oh! 
[00:01:00]  What's that sound?  Yo, cracker!  Get the f*** out of the motherf***ing car, bitch!  Oh, my God!  Dash!  See what happens when Whitey goes to the hood?  It's a pile of crack pipes outside our tent!  What does it mean?  I'm sorry I came up here!  I'm sorry! 
[00:01:30]  What is that?  Yeah, just a goofy radio pitch.  Oh, my God!  I'm scared!  Yeah!  I'm scared.  This project.  You gotta give I believe Anthony a lot of credit.  He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he  Hey, ass, turn down your radio. 
[00:02:00]  1027 WNEW.  Talking about Steel Reserve High Gravity Lager.  Well, there's a problem.  In the community.  As Reverend Al so eloquently puts it,  that this Steel Reserve High Gravity Lager,  the ads are racist.  They show two tortoises having sex.  And that's racist.  And it says research shows sex sells. 
[00:02:30]  Well, I guess it's racist putting such distasteful ads  in only certain neighborhoods.  But they think you don't see these ads on Park Avenue.  It's all about supply and demand.  Yeah.  I guess there's a demand for this stuff in the community.  All right, so this is the beer everyone's talking about,  the High Gravity Steel Reserve.  Can I have one?  No, it's funny.  Remember what I said earlier in the show?  I said, is Budweiser available in some of the communities  that only handle Steel Reserve, like Harlem?  And somebody said, yeah, but it's an import. 
[00:03:00]  It's only available as an import.  All right.  All right, here we go.  Let me crack open.  Wait.  Oh, with a fine twist off top.  8.1 proof.  Whoa!  No, it's got 8.1% alcohol.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  First of all...  12 fluid ounces.  Nice and cold.  Wait a minute.  First of all, this color is a little off.  Doesn't it look like a urine specimen?  Oh, wait a minute.  I seem to have given you the wrong jaw.  I've been watching some In Living Color. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  High gravity, Steel Reserve.  Let's take a swig.  Wow.  Oh, that's disgusting.  Whoa!  Goddamn!  Where Goddamn?  Now, that's good stuff.  All of a sudden, you start talking black when you drink this.  Now, wait a minute.  Hey, this stuff is potent.  Holy smoke.  Ow, man.  What the...  It's strong. 
[00:04:00]  This is strong.  Yeah, it's strong.  Mmm.  It's stronger when it's warm.  Oh, I bet.  I don't like it.  Damn.  Do you like it, Ed?  It's not awful bad, like Meisterbrow or something.  No.  This is like the other side of the spectrum.  I don't know.  I'd drink this in the cold on a street corner or something.  Maybe that's why it's got more alcohol in it.  No, I'm serious.  Maybe after you've already had six years ago.  But if I was at home and I was enjoying an after-dinner brew, this wouldn't be the one I'd go for. 
[00:04:30]  I am outraged!  Oh, no.  I am outraged!  Reverend Al...  I am outraged!  What the hell are you doing in the studio?  I see you drinking the Steel Reserve high-gravity lager.  Well, we want to try it.  There's a lot of controversy about this stuff, so...  This is a plot, a conspiracy, by the white man.  Why is that?  8.1% alcohol.  Yeah.  Well, obviously, they want the homeless to drink this, so when they die on the streets, they're already embalmed. 
[00:05:00]  You got an extra bottle.  Hey, this stuff's pretty good.  You can have mine.  All right.  Wow.  Steel Reserve.  No, that's just not happening for me at all.  Hey, leave the music on.  It's kind of a soundtrack.  I like it.  All right.  But Doug has brought us something else here, too, to try out.  Oh, yeah.  Steel Reserve.  Boy, I drank two sips and I'm tanked. 
[00:05:30]  It went right to my head, but...  All right.  What else did you bring?  He brought, um...  Wow.  A blackened tambure called Howling Monkey.  Oh, come on.  Look at the label.  Where's my...  Where?  All right, here's my Howling Monkey.  Dude, look at the label.  Let me see the label.  It's a monkey in a suit.  It is.  It's Planet of the Hades.  Oh, my God.  The label is adorned with the image of Dr. Zaius.  Damn you.  Damn. 
[00:06:00]  Let me partake in some of this Howling Monkey.  Damn, it's not bad.  My God.  The image of Dr. Zaius staring back at me.  Damn you all to hell.  I can't be drinking Howling Monkey.  But I'm strangely drawn to it.  Drawn to the Howling Monkey.  As I was drawn to Zeri. 
[00:06:30]  Lovely Zira.  Cornelius never knows.  He will never know what happened between me and Zira.  We drank a case of Howling Monkey.  And then I turned her into a Howling Monkey.  Yes.  I dropped my loincloth.  She saw the man with no hair on his body.  I gave her some of Jarton's meat.  Yes.  I partook in monkey meat while drinking. 
[00:07:00]  Howling Monkey.  Damn me to hell.  I like the Howling Monkey.  Well, is it better than the Steel Reserve?  What's the alcohol content on me?  All right.  Shut this music.  Give me Reverend Al's and I'll go back to the Steel Reserve.  All right.  We need a little more Steel Reserve.  Wait a minute.  You're mad to me.  All right.  All right.  Here's Steel Reserve.  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Steel Reserve definitely stronger.  It's got a stronger taste to it.  Ah, that's gross.  The Howling Monkey.  You don't like it?  You don't like the Howling Monkey?  No.  That's a better one.  Now, is this sold in the black community still?  Is this in the community?  This was around here.  We could get this around.  Oh, it is?  We saw some stores.  All right.  Damn.  I don't know.  Well, the Steel Reserve will get you snotted.  I'll give you that much. 
[00:08:00]  I'll give you that.  Let me tell you, if I was impoverished and had a lot of problems and had to worry about  crime and shootings in my community and raising my children and sending them to a school  where they might be shot or stabbed, I would drink the Steel Reserve.  I think that's an endorsement for the Steel Reserve.  Yo, man, slide a piece of the bottle and drinks out on the job.  Steel Reserve.  It's I.  You can hide some conflict. 
[00:08:30]  Piss me off, okay?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot.  Oh, come on, mom.  Don't bang Opie.  You f*** my mom.  I'll f*** yours.  Oh, this is disgusting.  I say lay back and enjoy it.  It's a hell of a toboggan ride.  Opie is happening.  A couple of real motherf***ers. 
[00:09:00]  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  All right, Derek, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, listen, I know something you should never, ever, ever do in bed.  Okay.  I'm married to a black chick.  Yeah.  Does she appreciate that?  So, listen, we're in bed.  We're going at it.  I mean, shock Zulu style.  She's going absolutely nuts.  She's screaming.  She's going crazy.  Yeah.  So, of course, I get a little excited.  My head turns to mush.  So, I tell her, put a little nigger into it. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Her head snaps around.  A dreadlock hits me in the face.  I'm telling you, we went from playing jungle fever to being in a jungle safari.  It was like a tiger hunting me, chasing me around the house.  What exactly did you mean by put a little nigger in it?  Well, black girls have a little rhythm to them that white girls don't have.  And once they start dropping it on you like that, you don't know where you are. 
[00:10:00]  So, I guess she wasn't doing that.  So, you figured you'd get her to do it by saying that?  Oh, my God.  I thought the, uh, I was calling her, you know, African princess.  Come on, my little black princess.  And then I said nigger into it.  Holy.  You have no idea.  I can only imagine.  I'm telling you, she turns into one of those shock Zulu looking chicks.  Shock Zulu.  Her teeth flared up.  Her nose flared up.  What are you talking about?  I'm a lawyer and a diva. 
[00:10:30]  I don't know what to tell me to put a little nigger in it.  I whooped your ass.  Hell yeah.  Opie, Anthony, Opie, Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.  Too stupid.  Opie.  You know how much money I'm making to suck this mad?  You little freak.  Anthony.  I find you repulsive. 
[00:11:00]  Poor.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Yadda-doo, deedle-dee.  Yadda-doddle.  Yadda-dee.  Now, Greaseman, what are you?  Darlingsy, snarlingsy.  I was being offensive.  Yadda-doodle-dee.  Gobbledy-goo.  Greaseman, you really got to get another job because we're sick of having you on our show.  Wadda-doddle, please hire me.  Somebody hire me, the Greaseman, for a radio show. 
[00:11:30]  Well, I hear that you're looking at a job for Crayola.  Well, yes.  With Crayola, I shall.  Well, actually, the Greaseman is coming out with his own line of crayons.  Racially insensitive crayons.  I looked in the paper this morning.  I saw, the Greaseman saw that Crayola is removing Indian red from their box of crayons.  Because it's not politically correct, and they don't want to tick off any people.  Insensitive to the Indians, as we like to call them, the cowboy killers. 
[00:12:00]  I remember, as a cowboy slinging lead against the Indians, their arrows whooshing over my head.  The red skin.  But yes, very, very upset about Indian red in the crayon box.  So Crayola pulled it.  Well, they're going to continue making the color.  They want people to come up with a new name for that color.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Let's see.  How about Kimo Sabi? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yaddle-doodle.  Snarling.  Bone dry.  Bone dry.  Yeah.  You're just not politically correct, Greaseman.  Well, I'm hoping to get some money with my new crayon line.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Greasola crayons.  Greasola crayons.  Greasola crayons.  His sharpener on his side makes the crayons as pointy as my head.  Yaddle-doodle.  Bone dry.  Bone dry.  Now, could you name some of the crayons that you will be offering? 
[00:13:00]  Well, let's say a young child, a little young waif, wants to draw the sun.  Oh, that's nice.  Nice bright sun.  Sure.  Little picture, eh?  In his kindergarten class.  You know what color he'd use?  Huh.  In the Greasola crayon set?  What?  Kink yellow.  Yaddle-doodle.  Yaddle-doodle.  Just a big circle.  And you color it in with some chink yellow.  Yaddle-daddle.  And, of course, you can't complete the scene without maybe some flowers basking in the heat  of that chink yellow sun. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, that would be nice.  Sure.  Right, so you draw some tulips.  Okay.  And, of course, you use homo pink.  Homo pink, eh?  The shade of pink loved by bone smugglers everywhere, eh?  Yaddle-diddle.  Doodle-dye.  How about Polish purple?  Ah, Polish purple sounds neat.  Polish purple.  Why Polish purple, though?  Well, look, it's green.  Yaddle-diddle-dye.  The crazy Polacks can't get the colors right there. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, my.  Mick, Mick Green.  Mick Green, I'll say.  Yes, the color of the shamrocks.  That's right.  Mick Green, eh, Mick Green.  Bone dry, bone dry, yeah.  Yaddle-doodle.  Wow.  And, of course, wetback brown.  Of course.  And then, of course, I have the special Italian crayon there.  And what's that?  Look, it's a grease pencil.  Greasy little dago pencil. 
[00:14:30]  Yaddle-diddle-doodle-dye.  Bone dry, bone dry.  Very nice.  Oops, I'm being removed from my seat.  Hey.  By CBS brass.  Oh, it's happening again, Dad.  Whoa.  Yaddle-diddle.  Bone dry, bone dry.  They're yanking him out of the studio again.  Whoa, look at that.  CBS boss has dragged him out again.  He's going to go back on his apology tour.  Grease all the crayons.  Grease all the crayons.  Boy.  That's kind of cute, huh?  A little insensitive there.  Big time. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  Obi and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  He can't seem to stay out of the way.  We got Channel 10 news on.  Got a megaphone and something to say.  There's Mark.  There's Mark.  Causing trouble on CBS 2.  With the hugest wow stuff.  Monster Kramer.  Is a tight-ass crew.  This is like, you know, I can keep it.  Like, oh, Mark.  He's a freak.  There he is.

[00:16:00]  What the hell are you boys doing? You're interrupting our own news broadcast. God's sake.  You know we're going to get in trouble by the company again.  Yeah, I know.  Take on my heart.  Chance, whip them out. Whip them out.  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on.  Come on.  Why is she clear? She's so mad at me.  You tell her to go to our boss.  No, I'm not. I'm just hanging out.  If you should be allowed to do your job, I should be allowed to do Mark. 
[00:16:30]  I almost pissed in my pants.  That was the funniest thing I've seen in a very, very long time.  Mark, I got one question for you.  How do you walk around with that set you got?  What do you, like, walk around like John Wayne?  Wayne, like?  Yeah, I just want to know, guys, when is the farewell show going to be?  That's why you're going to listen every day.  This could be it right here today. You never know.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:17:00]  Someone get this pen out of my nose.  1027 WNEW.  All right, it's 1027 WNEW.  It's the O&A show.  Hey, man.  Better known as the Opie and Anthony show.  And we are live.  Yes, we are.  It's January 17, 2000.  Yeah.  It's MLK Day.  Yes, it is.  And we're going to play a couple more songs, and we're going to get the festivities rolling along, Anthony.  We'll let everybody in on the secret, or not really secret.  I know a lot of people are making wages, so we will have the results when we get back. 
[00:17:30]  Did Opie pussy out, or did he actually get his eyes done?  Hmm.  Hmm.  You'll find out next.  In the meantime, it's Ozzy.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  I, I, that.  This is debauchery mania.  I, I, that.  Prostate exams for everyone.  I, I, that.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, we are here. 
[00:18:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show, and we are finally ready to broadcast.  My buddy, my pal, Antonio.  Hey.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Not bad.  Uh, let me, uh, read the phone number behind your head there, Anthony.  Yeah.  Way, way in the distance.  Phone number is, uh, 212-757-1027 if you have anything for the show.  And I see you're reading that, uh, without your glasses, Opie.  That's right.  Yeah, Opie didn't, uh, pussy out.  I did not pussy out. 
[00:18:30]  I had my eyes done this weekend.  I made a little wager, and I lost.  I found out that, like, the whole building made wagers.  Yeah, I was betting for sure.  And I was the long shot to get it done.  You were going to pussy out.  Hell no.  I don't even know where to begin.  I got to look out the window again, old man.  Yeah, that's all he's been doing.  He gets up, he goes to the window.  We're walking to the studio.  He's looking out the window going, oh, I can't believe it.  Look, I can read that sign.  Look at the, he's like, look at the, the big tanks that hold the water on top of the buildings. 
[00:19:00]  I'm like, yeah, Opie, well, they've been there forever.  Seen plenty of them.  Here's a little song for you, Opie.  I can see clearly now the rain is gone.  Yeah.  I can see all obstacles in my way.  I'll tell you one thing.  I see how ugly all you mother huckers are. 
[00:19:30]  I want my old eyes back, man.  You guys are some ugly mofos.  You must not have passed by a mirror, man, either, huh?  No, actually, no, I passed by a mirror this morning.  I'm like, wow, you're a good-looking guy.  Dude, I got to tell you, man, I'm in a great mood today.  Got to say, got to say, this is a modern-day miracle.  You're all excited with your new eyesight.  I got to thank the fine doctor, Dr. Philotoff. 
[00:20:00]  He's not even advertising on the show yet.  Yeah.  I could care less.  He's going to get like a two-hour commercial today.  Opie's been talking about this guy like he is the Messiah.  If Dr. Philotoff said, drink the Kool-Aid, I would drink the Kool-Aid.  He is my new God.  He should have a doctor.  What's his name?  Philotoff.  Philotoff?  Yeah, he's got a Dr. Philotoff day.  He's got an MLK day.  He's got an MLK ever bring Opie new eyes?  No. 
[00:20:30]  Where do you want to begin with this?  I have seen the mountaintop, and it's clear with my new eyeballs from Dr. Philotoff.  Dude, I was at the sushi restaurant with the boss today, right?  Yeah.  And he's talking about the show and stuff.  I'm not even listening to him because I'm like, oh, wow, it's 1.35.  And he's like, yeah, so?  No, you don't understand.  I'm reading it.  It's the clock all the way over there.  The clock's literally like 100 feet away.  No glasses.  No glasses.  And I'm like, hey, if you need copies, there's a copy place across the street from the sushi restaurant. 
[00:21:00]  I can see.  I see that.  I was at the back of the restaurant looking right through the window and reading copies on the other side of the street.  I couldn't even, like, see my hand in front of my face with my glasses on it.  Oh, bastard.  There are some downsides, though, I bet.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Go ahead.  Did you look down at your penis and say, God damn, it's so small?  Well, when it was all fuzzy and blurry, it kind of looked bigger.  Just be honest.  Did Rick write that line?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Then I could talk about blind man sex I had this weekend. 
[00:21:30]  I gave you a chance, Rick.  Welcome back to Rick, who was in London for, I don't know, it seemed like forever.  Does he have an accent?  Hello, hip hip.  Cheerio.  Oh, that's Rick.  Don't you hate them Puerto Ricans?  Well, let's get through the eye break.  I mean, we have so much to do today.  So I went up there Saturday, all the way up to Westport, Connecticut. 
[00:22:00]  The doctor, my new guy, Dr. Philatop, he has three offices.  But I went to the state-of-the-art office in Westport.  Yeah, that's the one you want.  Special client in, I think.  Oh, look at that.  So I go up there, and I'm not even going to lie to you.  I was like 50-50.  I went with another guy from here that was definitely going through the procedure.  And I went up there just freaking out, just freaking.  Well, we heard about some people who had similar surgeries from other doctors, I guess.  And a couple of them had horror stories. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  And then just the procedure sounds like a horror story because they have to cut your cornea.  They have to cut the surface of your eyeball.  Yeah, with this, like, fine razor instrument.  Yeah, and it, like, makes a flap over the front of your eye, and you flap it over,  and then he does his little laser stuff, and then flaps it back.  Yeah.  So it just sounds like, and you go blind for the period of time where he flaps the flap up.  Well, I can tell you about all that now from firsthand experience.  So I get up there.  I can believe you went through it. 
[00:23:00]  And you know when, like, you have, like, an oral report due in school?  Yeah.  And you never want to be first?  Uh-huh.  And it just feels better when you just keep your hand down and you don't go?  Sure.  For some reason, stalling makes it that much easier.  So I'm in the waiting room, and there was, like, five of us.  And all of a sudden, I was just praying, like, any other person was going to go first.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, the good doctor goes, all right, I hope you come with me.  I'm like, you wanted me out of the way like that.  So I go to the back. 
[00:23:30]  And he checks my eyes.  He says, you're definitely a good candidate and stuff.  And he explained exactly what was going on.  And I've got to be honest, dude.  You know how much of a wimp I am?  Yeah.  By the time he was talking to me for, like, ten minutes, I was like, piece of cake.  Let's go.  Ready to go.  And then I had to sign the consent form.  That's when they give you, like, you know, some Valium.  They gave you Valium?  Yeah.  Dude, I popped Valium like it was M&M's this weekend.  You got any left?  Yeah, I got some.  Let's do the show on Valium today, man.  You don't understand. 
[00:24:00]  Come on.  That'll be cool.  We'll pop a couple and just be all lethargic for the show.  Hey, man.  Hey.  How long have we been off the air?  Isn't this place great?  I love this place.  Not a problem in the world.  So, yeah, so they gave you some Valium to take the edge off.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  I never felt the Valium kick in while the operation and everything was going on.  I felt it on the way home on I-95 where I was out cold in the back seat with my eyes wide open. 
[00:24:30]  Who drove you?  My brother dissed me, so it was his roommate and his girlfriend.  But anyway, so they numb the hell out of your eye with all these drops and stuff.  I don't know.  Some kind of anesthesia and stuff, right?  Can you move them or anything, is it?  I'm freaking out just thinking about this.  I don't know.  I get it because it works so fast.  You know, by the time they numb them and then prepare your eyes for the surgery, you don't really want to move them.  And they tape back your eyelashes, right? 
[00:25:00]  Then they put this, like, thing in your eye, like, look down, look up.  Something to keep me glossies open.  Right.  So now there's something attached to your eye, right?  Yeah.  And then they put another instrument on that that kind of, like, sucks your eye out tiny bit.  Wait.  Well, that's the feeling I got.  Sucks your eye out?  Not out of it.  Just kind of gives it a little pressure, okay?  Okay.  Dude, I'm telling you, you remember how much of a wimpo was, right?  You're a big pussy.  I didn't care less.  And then all of a sudden, before I knew it, he goes, okay, it's a very nice flat that was created. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, I'm scratching my eyes.  They hurt now.  So I didn't even know when he made the incision.  No clue.  I swear to you.  And then he goes, okay, you might lose sight for about 10, 15 seconds.  So he pulls the flat.  And I lost sight, but I could see shapes kind of like.  I lost the light.  But, I mean, all this equipment is so, like, close to your face that it doesn't really bother you because the other eye is wide open.  You can see the rest of the room. 
[00:26:00]  So it's like, well, whatever.  You know, I could live with one eye that's working.  Oh.  And then this is the part.  They go, you see that blinking red light?  It's not the actual laser, but they want you to focus on something.  Yeah.  They're like, stare at that and don't move.  I'm like, oh, this might be the important part of the operation.  And all of a sudden, they just blast away with a cold laser.  15 seconds.  Puts the flap down.  Takes something that kind of felt like a very, very, very, very fine paintbrush. 
[00:26:30]  And, you know, kind of smoothed out like he's smoothing out wallpaper.  Like he's smoothing out wallpaper.  But that's like the flap getting pushed back into place.  Good to go.  Then he did the other one.  The whole procedure lasted tops 15 minutes with prep and everything.  Oh, my God.  My eyes hurt.  Really?  They're hurting just talking about that.  All right.  I don't want to bore everyone with the rest of the procedure.  So then they do both eyes, and they walk you down to the recovery room, which is, you 
[00:27:00]  know, whatever.  It's not even a recovery room, really.  And the sensation you have is it's like you're in a very foggy place.  Yeah.  But you can see through the fog and go, wow, my eyesight is better.  But it's really foggy, so you can't really appreciate it.  Oh, my God.  So then they sit you down, and they give you, like, the grandpa glasses.  Look at the glasses you have.  This is what I used to have.  Oh, my God.  This is what I used to have Ray Charles sex with Rick's sister when I got home.  Thank you, please.  That's right.  So you put these on just to protect your eyes. 
[00:27:30]  Your old man glasses.  For 24 hours.  Those are the glasses we have goofed on relentlessly on this show.  I know.  I need my tongue glasses to wrap around one to Terminator on my little red coat.  So they give you that for, like, out of the way, please.  They give you that for 24 hours.  I'm looking for Sarah Connor.  She's got my colostomy bag.  So it was good that I told the doctor that I was a little freaked out because they gave  me a nice supply of Valium for the ride home. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And I slapped that night.  I woke up Sunday morning, and it was still, you know, it was, my eyesight was much improved,  but it was still a little foggy and stuff.  It was almost like looking through binoculars, and it was a little off.  I felt like if I could fine-tune it.  Just focus a little bit.  Focus a little bit that I'd have unbelievable eyes, right?  And as the day went on, it got better and better and better, and I went to bed last  night.  You have to wear these eye shields.  This morning at 7.02, because I looked at the clock for the first time, the sun is coming 
[00:28:30]  through my bedroom window.  I took off the eye shields, dude.  It was like I was reborn.  Like a...  Everything was...  Wizard of Oz, when she walks out of the house.  Oh, yeah.  It's all in color.  Everything was crystal clear, and from that moment, 7.02 this morning until now, I've been  just staring at everything.  Absolutely everything.  And your eyes don't hurt?  No.  That flap thing, I can't see it or anything. 
[00:29:00]  I don't get close to Anthony ever, but I got close to him today, so I could take a look  in my eye.  You couldn't tell anything, right?  Eyeballs are like big things of jello, I guess.  Yeah.  You know?  You just cut them, and they can suck back in on them.  You know, when I got home from the operation or the procedure, whatever you want to call  it, my eyes definitely ached.  You know, but they give you drops for that in case, you know, it's too bad.  And that feeling lasts about 10 hours.  Why do my eyes hurt?  You feel like you have like a hair in your eyes for about 10 hours. 
[00:29:30]  That's a little annoying.  Yeah, that's uncomfortable.  But now...  You're showing your porn from across the room.  Look at that.  Wow, I can see that from here.  Thank you, Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Nice.  Thank you.  A little porn from across the room.  And I'm not squinting, right?  Looking right at Beep.  And that's basically it.  Wow.  You didn't pussy out.  You went through it.  Didn't pussy out.  And honestly, I mean, I'll be the first to admit, I was a wimp when we were discussing  this last week.  But he put me at total ease, and I was fine. 
[00:30:00]  You know what it is?  It's like, you ever see Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where you fall asleep next to  the bean pod, and you wake up, and you accept the whole thing, and it's cool that you've  been invaded by the bean pod thing, and they're using your body, and everything's cool after  that.  And you go to the other people and go, no, it'll be cool.  Believe me.  And you're like, no, no.  That's what you were like.  Yeah.  Beforehand.  But now you have slept next to the bean pod, and you woke up, and now you are completely  for it.  Completely for it.  You would tell anyone who wanted to do this, it's a modern-day miracle. 
[00:30:30]  Because, I mean, I've had glasses since I was in third grade, Anthony.  Yeah.  I've tried all sorts of glasses, contacts.  I have never, ever, ever seen this good as I am seeing.  Wow.  It is amazing.  You know how I am, like, if I leave my glasses or lose them and I have to drive or something?  Yeah, you're freaking out.  It's almost impossible, but I could get away with it if I'm not driving too far during the  day, okay, and it has to be, you know, really bright out?  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Today, I drove into work, because I just had to.  Goddamn.  Just drove into work.  Had to.  He's been reborn.  And it was funny.  I almost got into a bunch of car accidents, because, like, instead of, like, paying attention  on the road, I'm like, wow, look at that.  I was checking out the skyline, you know, from a distance when I was on the expressway,  and looking to the right, looking to the left.  I was looking at everything but the road.  You're not going to get all religious on us now, are you?  Dude, if Dr. Philotoff said, drink the Kool-Aid, you would.  I would drink the Kool-Aid.  He goes, if you drink this Kool-Aid, you'll have great hearing as well. 
[00:31:30]  I would do it tomorrow.  I would have to believe at this point.  I'm amazed.  But I'm reading, like, license plates, you know, where, you know, I mean, really far up  the road.  I mean, things that normal people do on a daily basis and just take for granted, O.P.  Before the show, I had to run up to Greenwich, Connecticut to see the good doc, right, just  to make sure everything's cool.  You know, he takes his time and his patience.  This isn't a commercial, by the way.  I don't even know if the guy is officially going to advertise, but I am so happy about 
[00:32:00]  this.  I just wanted to share today.  And he brings me in, and I had a quick eye exam.  2020, no problem.  Two days ago, I was literally blind without these glasses.  Look at you.  2020, then he put up the 2015 line.  I made it, I was, like, almost there.  I could read, like, half of it.  So that's it?  You just don't need glasses anymore?  That's it?  Dude, here's my glasses.  Now, what would happen if you put those on now?  All right, let me look.  They'll probably look real blurry.  Is it going to look like it looks when normal people put on your glasses? 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let me see.  Yeah, I'm getting, like, completely dizzy right now.  I swear to God.  Take them off, you'll break your new eyes.  I'm getting completely dizzy.  Let me see yours.  Let me see these.  I'm going to look through them.  Oh, yeah.  Well, dude, that is just wrong.  He fixed that?  He fixed that.  God damn.  Man, I can't even look through those without feeling like I'm going to feel.  Talk to, like, our new boss, Jeremy. 
[00:33:00]  We walked down to the sushi restaurant.  I wasn't paying attention to him.  I was too busy.  I'm like, look, I could read that.  It says Wooters.  Look at that.  I was reading the Broadway sign, like, from a half a block away.  I can't do that, even when I have my glasses on.  It's like Flowers for Algernon.  You ever see that?  The guy was retarded, and they give him a drug, and he becomes like a genius.  But in the interim, he's just like, oh, look, I can read.  Yeah.  That's helping now.  He's like a retard.  What did I say in the office today?  I was, like, just staring out our office window, reading all the signs all over the street. 
[00:33:30]  There's no way I could have done that before today.  Matter of fact, I'm going to give you the pleasure.  Here's my glasses.  Oh, I've had these forever.  Yeah.  These used to be like gold to me.  Uh-huh.  I will allow you to smash them.  I think you should, because it's more symbolic, that way.  All right, I'll smash them.  Wait, let me put my old man glasses on.  Yeah, in a bit of irony.  Would that be the most ironic thing?  Like a Twilight Zone episode. 
[00:34:00]  Opie gets his eyes fixed.  He takes his glasses off, and then he puts them down to smash him to show that he's done with him.  Glass flies into both eyes, and he goes completely blind.  That's a Twilight Zone episode.  All right, I need to smash them into some, because this glass is going to go everywhere, man.  I am totally serious.  I'm going to smash them down there.  There's the hammer.  All right, we'll clean it up later.  All right, Ant.  All right, Opie, here it is.  Opie smashing his glasses.  And they're really his only pair of glasses. 
[00:34:30]  He does not need them anymore.  How important these things were.  Oh, these things were a big pain in the ass.  We'd go to appearances or something, and we'd leave, and it's like, oh, my God, where's my glasses?  Did I leave them there?  I can't find my glasses.  Where are my glasses?  I'll actually be able to say hi to all our listeners our next live appearance, because I used to fake that.  People would come up to me and go, hey, remember me?  I'm like, um, if I can see you, yeah.  My glasses.  I'm smashing my glasses and my shoes.  Here we go.  All right.  Let her rip up. 
[00:35:00]  Oh!  Wow, glass flying.  Whoa, look at the pieces.  You better watch your eyes, man.  Let's see the good doctor fix the big glass shard in your head.  Let me see.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So long, glasses.  Wow.  You've completely destroyed these.  Completely.  They're done.  Oh, yeah.  They're done.  That's it.  Done. 
[00:35:30]  Done-ski.  Good job.  We should auction them all.  Just explain on the website that I don't have to wear the old man glasses.  But undeterminated glasses.  Hello, please.  Thank you.  There you go.  I need my glasses.  Dude, they are smashed all over the studio.  Oh, the iChart?  There's glasses everywhere.  There's an iChart up on the wall now for you to read.  Opie's iChart?  I'm an asshole?  No, start with the first line. 
[00:36:00]  Dude, that's a joke.  I see I am gay or you.  What an idiot.  What about the bottom line?  Show me your stuff is the bottom line.  Wow, look at that.  That's pretty good.  All right, go smaller.  Look, he's showing off his new peepers.  Actually, I think what we need to do is get a couple naked broads down here.  So, Opie can finally see what the nude form looks like.  Because I will be able to see all the detail today. 
[00:36:30]  I ain't reading that, you ass.  I'm not reading that.  That's funny.  I will not read that.  And if you would like to read that one, you can.  Oh, I haven't had this.  I can't even see it, Opie.  My eyes were fine until I saw that line and you told me to read it.  Something about man-ass, that's all I'll say.  Yeah.  There you go.  It says, I love hot black.  And then what Opie said.  Yeah.  See, we can't have it on tape so Rick can pull it. 
[00:37:00]  But there you go, man.  I don't know what else to say.  But look, do you see what I just did?  I've been doing this all day.  I went to adjust my glasses.  Yeah, I think it's like when you get into the car that doesn't have the shift on the floor  and you're constantly going for the floor, shifting into reverse.  Because I used to have this habit where I would take this finger and go like this above my nose  to push the glasses back into place because those glasses, you know, I've had forever.  I've been doing this all day going, oh, yeah.  Take them.  They're yours.  Look at these things. 
[00:37:30]  They're smashed.  That's it.  They're gone.  Buy glasses.  There you go.  So I had a great weekend.  Very nice.  Valium helped.  You got any left?  I got some.  Yeah?  How many?  How many you need?  Want to hug it?  Let's do a couple.  Actually, we just wanted to show Ope something that he hasn't really seen in real life until today.  Oh, get Patty out of here.  Oh, look.  It's Patty.  The first chick you see is Patty.  Oh, please. 
[00:38:00]  Can I get my old eyesight back, please?  He wants his eyes punctured with the lasers.  Patty.  No more glasses.  No more glasses, Patty.  Cool.  Uh-oh.  She's going for an envelope.  Yeah, I have a little card that I made for the two of you because you got your little  pre-syndication in Boston.  So I thought I could congratulate you.  All right.  Why did you give it to Anthony?  Yeah, read it.  Go ahead.  Read it from there.  Ope's got the new eyes.  He should be able to read it. 
[00:38:30]  From there, I can't read her handwriting from there.  Give it to Ope, Patty.  If you go a little closer, I can read it.  Let me see.  Oh, stop.  Cut out letters from a newspaper.  No, you've got to read the front first.  Ope and Anthony, you guys rock.  I'm happy for your continued success and congratulations on your thing in Boston.  In fact, your syndication should go a long way.  Yeah, no, look. 
[00:39:00]  All the power to you.  You're going places, like Patty.  And the card is a picture of the whole world, Anthony.  Oh, look at that.  Ope and Anthony all over the whole world.  Thank you, Patty.  Thank you, Patty.  I'm very big on it.  So it was funny.  Last night, my brother comes over.  Yes.  And I have this really bad habit, even with, like, my glasses and stuff.  We'll finally end this discussion where I squint and make really retarded faces to try to see stuff. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And we're watching The Sopranos last night.  Yeah.  And he couldn't even watch the TV because I'm just sitting there with, like, normal eyes.  Even though they were even better when I woke up this morning, but they were, you know, pretty good last night.  He's begging me, for the love of God, squint.  Do something.  Squint.  Squint.  Look like a retard.  Right.  I'm like, I don't need to anymore.  You watch The Sopranos?  Yeah.  I wasn't able to watch.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You could blow it for me.  It's just one episode.  No.  Honestly, what I need from you is, because I didn't see the first season.  Yeah.  Like, I caught, like, two shows maybe for 10, 15 minutes. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Right after commercials, I need you to explain The Sopranos to me.  A little background for you.  I'm completely confused.  Like, his mom's in the hospital.  She had a stroke.  I'm a little pissed.  And then little Steven.  I don't know what he does.  He's part of the crew.  All right.  But could you explain all this to me after commercials?  All right.  Any questions.  And then I'll explain some of the stuff that happened last night.  Was that talentless bitch Janine Garofalo in the first episode?  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  She shows up this season.  I'm pissed at them for even including her in my show. 
[00:40:30]  Hmm.  All right.  We'll talk about that next.  Yeah.  Bones are going nuts, by the way, as well.  Stay on the line.  But, Dr. Philitoff, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hope he's Lord and Savior.  I'm a new person today.  Opioid Anthony's show.  Opioid Anthony's show.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opioid Anthony show.  We are live on this fine MLK day.  Yeah, it's like a holiday today or something. 
[00:41:00]  Right?  Yeah, I guess it is.  Yeah.  It was so easy to get into work today.  Very easy.  I don't know if it's the freezing cold weather or that or holiday.  That helps.  That helps because the pain in the ass pedestrians aren't trying to cross the street against the  walk signs.  There aren't that many pedestrians on there.  No, not at all.  Which is good.  You can't breathe out there.  A little bit of a breeze hits you in the face. 
[00:41:30]  You're like, you can't breathe.  So much for global warming.  Yeah, that went out the window.  Just when you start really worrying and thinking, wow, maybe there's something to that global  warming.  It is effing cold out, man.  You get a couple days like today and then you're like, okay, it's not too bad.  How are you supposed to even function outside like this?  There's no functioning.  Well, the funny thing is, you used to have to work in this weather, Anthony.  Call rooftops.  Let's not forget.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get on a rooftop and...  How many minutes have you spent outside today? 
[00:42:00]  Be honest.  Total of a minute?  Okay.  Let's see.  I was going to walk from the house to the store one block away to get something to drink.  No, you drove.  I got up.  I walked outside.  Went F this.  Hopped in my truck.  Started it up.  Get the heat going.  And then drove a block to the store.  Then drove back to the house and left the car running for an hour until I left.  So the heat would still go. 
[00:42:30]  I swear to God.  Drove right into the garage so you didn't have to hit the outside there.  So you've been outside maybe 30 seconds and you're bitching and complaining.  There are guys that listen to our show.  There are guys that listen to our show that are in places right now that you do not want  to be working their tails off.  I was there, Mr. Caddy.  You forgot, though.  Not many foursomes going out on the golf course on days like this, I don't think.  Right-o?  Huh?  I was out there, rooftops.  That's right.  West End Drive over there on a rooftop by the river. 
[00:43:00]  Ho!  Freezing cold like this.  Cut a hole in the roof.  And I'd have to cut a hole in the roof.  When we first moved to New York and we moved back to New York, I should say, and we were  tooling around town, Anthony would point out all the buildings he did.  Yeah.  Like, wow, that's real fascinating.  Thanks for sharing.  Did a little five-story brownstone over there on 62nd.  Uh-huh.  That's right, for the wonderful Rexon people, and wanted a pizza oven on the third floor 
[00:43:30]  to be ducted out the roof.  You know what, like, a brownstone is like?  They weren't built.  They were built like five separate little apartments.  Now it's one big place that he wants a stack going up through the roof.  You can't notch these floors.  That's when you read about buildings falling down.  And then every two days he changed something.  Off the road was so crazy.  And there was a little guy, little guy.  That ran the job site named Emilio.  Yeah.  He'd run around this place.  Why you come in late every day? 
[00:44:00]  Why you later every day?  Because I don't like to work, Emilio.  But he'd run around the place.  And there was this little one-person elevator.  And I used to try to avoid him by jumping in the elevator and going up to a new floor.  And I'd hear him run up the stairs.  So I'd have to pick another level and go down.  I called it Super Emilio Brothers.  It was like a video game.  Try to stay away from him.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Those were my working days, I think.  Yeah, those were the days.  And yeah, it was very cold.  You don't know what it's like when the building's just framed out. 
[00:44:30]  It sticks, not even siding.  Wind just howling through.  And you've got to deal with sheet metal that's frozen.  Bill, what's up?  I love this job.  Hey, man.  All right.  What's going on?  I just want to say you guys are great, man.  I listen to you all the time.  Hey, thank you.  Let me get through my afternoon.  I'm hanging off the roof.  I've been up there since 6 o'clock this morning.  Really?  You guys are talking about cold, man.  I so know what you're talking about.  Yeah.  I've got three patterns of long johns on, a pair of sweatpants, and a pair of vinyl windbreaker  pants. 
[00:45:00]  Let me get 10 regulars.  Oh.  And now you're getting gas.  Yeah, I'm getting gas.  Got some job he's serving on me.  All right.  Let me ask you guys.  I love winter.  You guys have got white gas station attendants out there?  Where?  In New York.  Because I'm in Jersey, man.  And I haven't seen one since, I don't know, I was about six.  There hasn't been a white gas station attendant since, yeah, since I was like a little taut.  I mean, what's going on?  Where'd we go wrong?  Why?  This guy kind of looks like he was cold, but yeah, I had a...  What, do you want to be pumping gas? 
[00:45:30]  My gloves, everything.  My feet, three pairs of long johns, and I still froze.  Yeah.  My lips are like bleeding or so chapped.  It's so bad.  I hate my job.  I'm about to quit.  Actually, can I give my boss nephew for Friday early?  Yeah, hey, go ahead.  All right, go to PCI.  F you, man.  You go up on the roof.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Bye.  Bye, guys later.  All right.  White gas station attendants.  That's something you just don't see anymore.  No.  We could start a whole thing.  Things you just don't see anymore in the year 2000.  One of them is white gas station attendants. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Remember the guy that used to come over, hey, wash your windshield.  Check your oil.  That doesn't happen anymore.  Well, how about you did?  What did you do?  Fill it up.  Fill it credit.  Fill it credit, guys.  What did you do?  Hey, Christian, what's going on?  You need a receipt, but a receipt, but a receipt, but a receipt, but a receipt, but a receipt.  It was reset.  The word receipt is very difficult for these people.  You need a receipt, but a receipt, but a receipt, but a receipt, you need a recipe.  Christian, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Yeah, I was going to actually, real quick, there's actually two white gas station attendants right where I live. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, very good.  Ocean Township, New Jersey.  Okay.  Two of them.  That's rare.  That's a rare sighting.  All three in Tuesdays, I see them.  Opie.  Yeah.  Your new vision.  How's your vision at night?  Honestly, I mean, this is the first day that it's crystal clear, so I drove into work to test that out tonight on the way home,  but yesterday when it was about, you know, 70% better, I went outside, and it seemed like I wasn't going to get those halos and stuff. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, that's a rumor, because I'm considering getting it myself, because I've been blind as a bat since I was five.  Right.  No matter what to do, make sure you do your research.  I mean, ask Anthony.  I was going to do this last April, and I wanted to make sure, you know, I had all my facts, and I studied up on this.  I read every article on it.  I looked into the doctor's education, how long they've been doing it, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Not to bore you guys to death, but definitely take your time and do the research.  Oh, is that training here?  No.  No, I know.  But it's very important, because the one thing I learned, there's a lot of guys out there now that are offering, you know, 
[00:47:30]  the operation very, very cheap for, like, less than $1,000.  Yeah, they get, like, a week in certification.  Well, it turns out that a lot of these guys, yeah, they could go to L.A. or something, and they get trained to do this,  and within, like, a week, they're doing it on your eyes.  Oh.  That's what scared me about this.  I made sure I found a guy that did a hell of a lot of them before me.  So, all right?  All right.  It's good to go.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, bro.  Love you guys.  See you.  All right, man.  Stu, you're next on 1027 WNEW. 
[00:48:00]  What's up?  Hey, Opie?  Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on a successful eye surgery.  And thanks.  Anthony, do you wear glasses?  No.  Well, then you have no idea how happy Opie is.  I know.  Did you see the episode of The Simpsons when Homer grows hair?  Yeah, that's how you feel.  You know what I'm saying?  You go outside, you find someone who could see, and you give them a big hug.  That's how you feel.  Can I ask you a couple serious questions, actually?  Yeah.  Because I am considering doing this.  Did the doctors say anything about the possibility of needing to do this again in the future, like 15, 20 years? 
[00:48:30]  Honestly, no.  No.  You know, some people need a stronger glasses when they get older.  Well, 20 years will have a cybernetic eyeball.  Right.  Actually, we will need to see it by that point.  Yeah, we won't even need to see.  We'll just be brains floating around.  Honestly, you know, when I was doing my research, I couldn't find anything on long-term effects.  That scared me.  Did your doctor mention the possibility, like, I have really bad vision?  Right.  And he said there's a chance that, you know, they'll bring it up to 20, 50, and I'll still need glasses, and that really bothered me. 
[00:49:00]  Well, there's a bunch of people that get it done, and they still need reading glasses just because they're a little older or something or whatever.  But, yeah, I mean, I didn't have any of that, obviously.  Did they tell you not to rub your eyes for a couple days?  Oh, yeah, it's killing me.  I mean, I finally showered this morning.  But you can rub them now?  I don't want to because I'm a little paranoid.  I mean, I don't feel anything, no pain, no discomfort, nothing.  I can't believe I had something, you know, done two days ago.  Right, right, right.  But I'm definitely going to wait a couple more days before I even touch my eyeballs. 
[00:49:30]  Go stare at some streetlights tonight.  Let us know if there's any halos tomorrow, okay?  That's the final test, and it's going to happen tonight.  Cool deal.  No, are you kidding me?  I'm going to a strip club tonight.  I want to see how good these eyes are.  Yeah, that's where you're checking.  I don't know how good they're in there.  All right, good.  Great.  Well, whatever you do, I mean, the guy who did me, I, you know, I absolutely love now.  He's a god in my eyes.  Is he a New York doctor?  Yeah, he has a New York office and two offices in Connecticut.  Right.  Dr. Philotoff.  He's not even advertising, so I don't think there's a big commercial. 
[00:50:00]  I think he might jump aboard because we've got a good relationship going.  Cool.  But if you guys are considering this, the only thing I suggest is really do your research  and really read up on it.  You probably don't want to talk about this, but how much did your guy charge?  Honestly, it's expensive.  Sure.  I'm not going to lie to you, but I don't know the exact price.  You didn't even try with insurance, right?  No chance, right?  Supposedly, insurance doesn't cover it.  Yeah.  All right, Opie.  Congratulations.  Take care.  Hey, thanks, too.  Bye.  Bye. 
[00:50:30]  What are you guys doing over there?  Oh, the story in the paper, the blind man that can see?  Oh, my God.  Is it worth all this to see if you're blind, though?  I could see a little laser surgery, but yeah, a little laser surgery.  This guy's got a hole in his head.  Go ahead, A.  He's drilled a hole in his head.  Opie, if you look at the plate the wires are coming out of,  there's little nuts and bolts.  Yeah.  It's bolted to his skull.  Yeah.  And wires are coming out of this guy's head.  He was blind. 
[00:51:00]  He still is.  He's 62.  Wants to only be known as Jerry.  Jerry, I have a hole in my head, Kramer.  And he's blind.  He's wearing these glasses that go to a computer.  The computer also goes into this guy's brain.  They connected electrodes directly to his brain.  The glasses have a camera on it.  It sends this image, but it's not really an image like we see it.  It's a bunch of dots of white light. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  Bunch of dots.  If a figure moves into your line of view, the dots will go away in the silhouette of  the figure.  So you'll see the outline of the guy.  How about that?  And that's what this is all about?  He can read letters on a sign.  Yeah, but they have to be two inches tall and stuff.  But this guy's probably as ecstatic as you are.  Think of this.  You just saw blurry when you didn't have your glasses on.  Right.  Now you see all clear.  Right.  And you're amazed. 
[00:52:00]  And I feel like I'm going to have to take out contacts after today.  And it's not going to happen.  This guy's like blind.  Now with these little dots of light, he sees things move in front of him.  That's got to be amazing.  That's got to be freaky.  But the amazing thing is it's from a camera on his glasses.  And it goes directly into his brain.  What kind of Frankenstein thing is this?  No, it's scary, too.  You know this is just going to get better and better and better.  The procedure, you know what I mean?  And it's going to get a little clearer the next time they do it.  And maybe they could, you know, this is like when your buddy jury rigs your TV set and the wires are hanging over the front. 
[00:52:30]  It's like, can't we put this all, can't we do the wires neatly behind the TV?  Can this be done in the skull?  Do you need this wire ponytail coming out of your head?  Can't his brains leak out or something?  Isn't there something detrimental to having a hole in your head to where your brain is?  Oh.  Oh, absolutely amazing.  This isn't the most amazing story of the weekend, though, Ann, as far as this type of surgery goes. 
[00:53:00]  Did you hear about the operation they did overseas?  A double arm transplant?  Yeah.  Double arm transplant.  Forearms and hands.  Forearms and hands.  Not forearms, you know what I mean.  The forearms.  Pretty much.  Oh, my God.  The guy can scratch it.  Pretty much right below the elbow.  Yeah.  On this guy, both arms.  Yeah, both arms.  Both arms were replaced below the elbow.  They took dead guy arms.  Dead guy. 
[00:53:30]  I can't get over this dead guy body part thing.  Dead guy arms.  Like, I can understand, okay, you know, tragic, you know, someone dies, motorcycle accident,  you give your organs, and someone has a new heart, new kidneys, whatever, liver, blah, blah, blah.  Fine.  I can understand all that, because you don't really see it.  It's inside you.  Yeah.  You might feel a little creeped out, a little weird that, you know, someone else's heart is beating in the middle of your body.  Yeah.  But to have, like, dead guy arms that you can see and touch and feel with, that is, that's, ah. 
[00:54:00]  Well, the whole thing is the outside of your body is you, you know?  That's you.  It's what you're known as.  Sure.  So there's personality to it.  So the dead guy's arms are still his arms, and he's dead, yet now they move.  Because they're on you.  They're being controlled by someone else.  Like, they should just be laying in a coffin, rotting, with the dead guy.  Yeah.  But no, they're moving, they're doing, they're spanking, you know? 
[00:54:30]  And that brings up that question, that age-old question.  If you're cranking it with the dead guy's hand, are you a hand homo?  No.  You know what happens?  You make the dead guy all of a sudden homosexual.  He's dead homo by proxy.  He lived his life as pure as could be.  He's in the coffin without his arms.  You are now using his arms to whack off.  You just made dead guy a gay guy.  Or how about you're fiddling around with your girl?  Is she cheating? 
[00:55:00]  She's with dead guy arms, you know?  All of a sudden, it brings up those questions.  Just look at your arms.  Imagine, like, they're not yours.  They're dead guys.  Like, the hair is different than the rest of your body.  Yeah, the coloring.  The coloring.  The fingernails.  The fingernails and stuff, it's not your arms.  Like, what do you do?  You wouldn't just walk up to some guy who's, like, eating KFC or something and go, oh, let me lick your fingers. 
[00:55:30]  Let me lick that off your fingers.  Yeah.  Oh, disgusts me just thinking something like that.  But now, if you're eating chicken with dead guy arms and you lick your fingers, would that now still skeeve you out?  I'd have a problem with that.  I'd have a problem with that.  Rick wants to know when he's lifting something heavy, if his arms can rip off.  Good to see he's at the gym.  Oh, damn.  God, that is so skeevy.  It just opens up a hole. 
[00:56:00]  But they're doing more and more of this type of transplant surgery with the, you know, hands and arms.  Because it's starting to work and they're able to make dead guy arms move on your body.  And you can feel.  And you can feel with the dead guy.  It just blows my mind.  Soon they'll be doing it with, you know, legs.  What else?  Imagine it's a skeeve.  Oh, like a whole lower torso transplant.  Imagine a junk transplant. 
[00:56:30]  Oh.  You're a dead guy and you donate your junk.  Your junk.  To another guy.  Imagine being, yeah, a real small one.  The guy, like, has some kind of an accident and it loses his huge skeeve.  And they're like, don't worry, we can do a junk transplant, you know.  And they do it and the guy wakes up and he's like, oh, my God.  What happened to Mike?  What happened?  I got dead guy junk.  We got dead guy junk and it's all small.  And this is before the swelling goes down.  The only suitable donor was Fred the Midget. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, poor guy.  Imagine that.  Junk transplant with small junk.  So a lot of things are happening over the weekend.  You've got the blind guy on the front of every paper.  Yeah, all in his head.  And then the two arms transplanted somewhere overseas over the weekend.  A lot of medical stuff.  And Dave.  Yeah, we'll get into the Dave Letterman thing.  What did he have?  What did he have?  Bypass.  What, though?  Not quadruple.  He had five.  So what's that?  Quinn?  Five? 
[00:57:30]  Five.  Wow.  Old Dirty's on the line.  Let's see.  Where's Old Dirty?  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll talk to Old Dirty and we'll take more of your phone calls in just a bit.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Opie.  You're a sick-ass man.  Anthony.  You're not a jackass.  You're obviously a stud.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on 1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  If you have anything. 
[00:58:00]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Let's talk to Old Dirty who's checking in here.  Old Dirty!  My man!  What's up, bro?  What up, baby?  How are you?  Thank goodness I had my Kevlar on last Thursday.  Why?  When I got showered with bullets.  Oh, yeah.  You got the airstrike yesterday.  Yeah.  Did I?  I sounded hot, though.  Yeah.  Yo, what's up?  What's up today, man?  Nothing, man.  Yo, what's up with this medicine, yo?  You're turning people into Mr. Potato Hedge, man. 
[00:58:30]  They should changeable parts, bro.  Oh, you're talking about the double arm transplant surgery?  Ew, man.  Isn't that whacked?  That's incredible.  First, they started off with the cloning of the sheep.  And now they're just exchanging eyeballs.  Blind men can see.  Scientific commentary from Old Dirty.  They got a pill that's going to cure everything.  What's up?  What's that?  I don't know.  Yeah, you didn't hear about that?  It's called Valium.  It doesn't cure everything, Old Dirty. 
[00:59:00]  It just makes you not give a crap.  Crap.  Yeah, but actually it started with the transplant of a hand.  Now they're transplanting arms.  That's incredible.  Dude, what would you do with a dead guy's arm, man?  I don't know.  I'd be happy to have one if I didn't have one in the first place.  I'd rather have, like, the metal hook or something.  The cold claw thing.  The cold claw thing?  Yeah.  I don't know if I'd accept a dead guy's arm on my body. 
[00:59:30]  Like a bionic arm, right?  A bionic prosthetic device that could crush, you know, like steel and stuff like that?  Well, if it was scientifically made, I wouldn't mind.  But you're talking about you have a dead guy's arm.  Yeah.  I mean, imagine you need to bite your fingernails.  They're not your fingernails.  What if it's like, yo, you ever saw it?  I forgot what a TV show it was.  It was a guy got transplanted with the arms of a murderer or something, a hand, and it flipped on him. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, started strangling people.  Yeah, bionic.  And what about that?  You know, someone like you, old dirty, you know, you got two transplanted arms.  You could commit all the crimes you want.  No one will ever know because it won't be your fingerprints.  Yo, that's right.  What did they do about the...  Well, you never had...  Let me see.  Yo.  Fingerprint.  You're thinking of all the possibilities.  I know.  They're eggless.  Jesus.  Yo, man, but yo, how complicated could that surgery be, though?  That's probably pretty complicated.  You're talking about the attachment of major arteries, veins, I mean, nerve endings. 
[01:00:30]  Well, they did it with a hand.  Dr. Dirty, right?  Didn't they do it with a hand in...  Wasn't the guy from Jersey Ant?  Yeah, Jersey.  With a hand.  The hand transplanted, like, a year ago?  Yeah.  And he was able to move the new dead guy's hand on his body.  They didn't...  Yo, wait a minute.  And now they're going for the whole arm.  I mean, right below the elbow is, like, a dead guy's arm.  My goodness, the manipulation of DNA. 
[01:01:00]  They're doing all...  Yo, what's up, man?  I mean...  Manipulation of DNA.  Yeah, yo.  It's kind of cool, but I just don't think I'd want...  It's kind of scary, man.  I don't want a dead guy's, like, body part, you know, that I can see.  If I had to have a heart or something, I'd go for that.  But, like, I don't know, man.  You've got to take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of your life with that stuff.  In your own body, you'll see the new parts as intruders.  Yeah, it won't match up and stuff.  Oh, no.  I don't know, man.  What's up with that? 
[01:01:30]  Somebody out there is on Valium.  Yo, what's up?  Yo, Opie.  Yo.  We've got to talk off the air about the Valium, kid.  You got more than that?  I got a few.  Open market, yo.  Put them on the Internet and arching them off.  Opie's Valium.  Yo.  So, what else is up, O.D.?  Nothing, man.  Same old thing, looking for a job.  How's the job hunt going, yeah.  Lavin?  How's the job hunt going?  I need a job transplantation is what I need, kid. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, it's MLK Day, man.  You celebrating?  Really?  What is, I mean...  Martin Luther King Day, man.  You doing anything special?  Yeah, we're going to crack a couple of 40s, you know, for the brother, whatever, but...  See, Ant and I aren't acknowledging the holiday.  That's why we're here.  Oh, that was...  Yeah, I don't know, Antony, should you ring the bell on that one?  There you go.  No.  What is that?  Earl took his day off?  Huh?  Earl?  Yeah, where's Earl today?  No, Earl's here. 
[01:02:30]  What is...  He doesn't need...  Earl's working on MLK, but Spaz took off.  Well, we gave Spaz a day off.  What kind of irony is that?  How weird is that?  Wait, that is something we've got to talk about really fast.  We gave Spaz today off.  Spaz, probably...  The biggest racist on this show.  The most racially insensitive person.  We gave him MLK Day off.  He's off.  Earl is working.  Well, Earl has more pictures to hang up.  Yo, how's it feel, kid?  Dude, we've got to tell you, man.  They gave Earl a job last week to hang... 
[01:03:00]  How many pictures, Ben?  We got a bust on Earl.  I'm sorry.  Five or six, I think.  Yeah, about six pictures.  They're redecorating the WNEW lobby area, and they have a big logo, and then they wanted  like six pictures to hang around the logo.  Yeah.  And there's like, you know, Ant and I with Sammy Hagar, and the radio chick is up there.  The fame pictures.  And a couple of the other shows around here that I don't know the names of.  So they give Earl, right, these six pictures to hang? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  How long would you guess it would take to hang six pictures?  Figure out a pattern.  How's it going to look?  Plan it out.  It would take an hour.  An hour, right?  Including labor.  Let's be fair.  How about two hours, because you just want to take your time and be all the way.  Yeah, all right.  You've got to make it look pro, bet.  Ready for this?  This is the God's honest truth.  Ben, tell the faithful listeners how long it took Earl to hang six pictures around the  NEW logo.  The entire day.  Yeah, the whole day. 
[01:04:00]  You mean the whole day?  The whole day.  I saw him out there.  There was a level on top of one of the pictures.  I swear to God.  A what?  A level.  It was on top of one of the pictures.  A level.  It all takes you to the extreme, right?  You could just eyeball some pictures.  Yeah, eyeball a picture.  O.D.  He put in for O.T.  What?  I don't know.  What?  He put in for O.T. because he went over his hours.  You should beat his ass, man.  For you. 
[01:04:30]  Is that him coming down to try to defend himself?  Look at him.  He's all pissed.  Listen to what Earl's going to say.  Read last.  Read last.  Come on, Earl.  Read last.  Hold on.  All right, Earl.  Come on.  Defend yourself.  I have seen the mountain top.  First of all, Earl, why didn't you take today off?  It's MLK, Dad.  Yeah, I did take it.  I just wanted to get some extra stuff done to you.  That's all.  Wait, you're off?  He's off.  Technically, I'm off.  We never know when you're on or off.  No.  I just wanted to fuss around with some stuff on the computer. 
[01:05:00]  All right, Earl.  How many hours did it take you to hang six pictures?  Be honest.  It took like three hours.  No way, man.  No way.  Not long ago, man.  No way.  No way.  It took me three hours.  Earl, Earl, Earl.  No, let me finish.  All right, but let me, let me, when I arrive,  I usually get here around 1130.  Is that fair?  Yeah.  Were you hanging pictures at?  Yeah, I started about 10.  I finished about noon.  No, no, no, no.  Because after the show, 7 o'clock that night,  I walked out there.  You were still fooling around with your pictures. 
[01:05:30]  No, we had the pictures up in one configuration.  No, let me finish.  One configuration.  Let me finish.  Let me finish.  We had a pattern done.  We had a pattern.  P. John.  P. John.  P. John.  P. John.  P. John.  P. John.  P. John.  P. John.  P. John.  He's getting sad.  We'll be done.  Duration.  No, we had it, we had it in a certain way.  Oh, my God.  How was that B wanted another way?  So we had to do it over again.  How many pictures did you have to hang?  Eight.  Eight around a logo. 
[01:06:00]  Eight around the logo.  So wouldn't that be two for each side?  I mean, how many patterns could you make out of it?  No, we had a, we had a pattern.  Rubik's pictures over there.  How was that B wanted another pattern?  So we took them, so we took them there.  Then they were up.  We took them, then they wanted captions in the photo.  So we had to take them back down again, take out the, take them out of the frame, make  labels for them.  Then when we made the labels, they said, no, the labels don't say in the right order who's  in the picture.  I just had my open empty with Sammy Hayden. 
[01:06:30]  I said, well, it doesn't go left to right.  So we had to redo the label.  I'm like, I know who, I was like, we know who they are.  Can I ask you who was telling you all this?  I am not at Liberty City.  A double aunt.  I would love to know who, who, uh.  Then they weren't clean enough.  So we had to take them down again and clean them.  And honestly, it took all day, right?  It took them, yeah.  All day to hang eight pictures that aren't even good pictures.  Did you like a loan?  Yes.  No, no.  Yes, I did.  Pete and Eddie were helping you out.  No, Eddie was not, now you're lying. 
[01:07:00]  Eddie did not help me with the picture.  You wouldn't have to, you are lying.  You are flat out lying.  No, I am pissed off because you are lying.  You are flat out lying.  Pete Johnson told me how, because there were these different clips you have to use to put  the pictures up.  It's not like hammering a nail and hanging them up.  Why?  Hammer a nail and hang it up.  It's worked for how many centuries?  There's a new way here at NEW to hang pictures.  I mean. 
[01:07:30]  He's getting mad.  Go ahead, Chuck.  I didn't get enough set up.  All right, try to explain yourself, Earl.  Go ahead.  Because the way the frames are set up, it's not like you could have the, I can't even explain  it.  But in terms of like bound so they don't fall down every time the door slams, you have  to put in these little hooks.  Yeah, grab one of them pictures there, Ben.  Let's take a look at what these look like.  They have a wire in the back.  But I did it by myself.  Yeah, they have wires in the back.  But I had to do it by myself. 
[01:08:00]  No one helped.  Everyone was walking by and saying, oh, look, girls hang up the picture.  I'm like, get off the hammer and nail.  Earl, you're not going to get sympathy from our listeners.  They're not asking for it.  There are guys listening that just spent 12 hours on the cold roof and it's 8 degrees  out.  No, I'm not asking for it.  I'm just saying I had to hang 8 of these.  How many were out there, Ben?  Was it 8?  Oh, yeah.  8 pictures.  Opie's an Anthony Bronco bash, Opie, from the last Super Bowl.  You might remember this picture.  Yeah.  A nice border inside the frame.  Well, he didn't have to do any of that. 
[01:08:30]  He really just had to hang them, right?  Were they all put together?  Or did you have to put the pictures in the frame?  I had to put the pictures in the frame.  We had to take old pictures out, re-pictures.  So it was 6.  It wasn't even 8 pictures.  No, I take it back.  There were originally 8 pictures.  Two were taken off the wall.  That was the other thing.  Two were on the wall and then they said, well, these 2 pictures really don't represent what  we are now.  Take them off.  So we had to take them off and recharge them again.  That must have been the picture of Tom Likas.  Which pictures don't represent what we are anymore? 
[01:09:00]  There was a picture.  No, it was just repeats.  There was one picture of Sammy Hagar.  All right.  So when you had the 8 pictures up and you had to take 2 down, it must have wrecked the whole  damn pattern.  I just wanted to pick.  So let me just put 4 on one side and 4 on the other.  That's all.  That was my idea.  I was just like, let's keep this very simple.  No, they had to be a certain way.  They had to be measured out.  They had to be balanced.  They had to be even.  They had to be this.  They had to be that.  It took all day. 
[01:09:30]  And I was by myself.  Let's just switch them all around.  Yeah, we're going to mess up the order.  We're going to mess up the order.  They had a hard hat and a hard hat and a hard hat with a flag mask.  Yeah, yeah.  There were cones set up.  The cones.  Rick's in here with the hammer and nail.  I've got a hammer.  I've got the nail and the little piece that was holding this particular picture.  I pulled it out of the wall.  Yeah.  My wife does these.  Takes her two minutes.  Beautiful pictures.  I'm not disputing that. 
[01:10:00]  What I am saying is.  Should we time him and put this up?  No.  Yeah, you'll sign it, kid.  All right, Ed is.  Start the clock.  All right, I'm starting the clock.  Go, Ed.  Ed is hanging a picture.  Ed.  Go.  Okay.  So far, Ed, you're up to three seconds.  Five.  Five seconds.  Six.  Seven.  Eight.  Eight.  Nine.  Ten seconds.  Now, time's that by six.  There we go.  It should take a minute.  It's a hung straight.  Ten seconds.  Ten. 
[01:10:30]  Ten seconds.  See, I'm not.  But I'm not.  Again, I am not disputing it.  I am not disputing it.  What made it such a time-consuming process?  Come on, Earl.  Get a laser.  No.  What made it such a time-consuming process?  It took twice as long as it took me.  Twenty seconds.  What made it such an incredibly,  like, unbelievably painful process was that  the pattern changed every ten seconds.  Every time we had it one way,  it was like, well, no, we got to put it there.  That's why it took all morning. 
[01:11:00]  And forgetting, let us forget,  I am by myself.  Earl, I like you too much.  Cut your losses.  Yeah, yeah.  I cannot, Maverick, punch out, Maverick.  Punch out, Maverick.  Punch out.  Every time you...  Uh-oh, here he goes.  Now he's pissed off.  Where's he going?  Look at that.  It's great.  It's level.  It's ten seconds.  And in ten seconds was able to, yeah,  perfectly put up a picture.  With the exact hardware that was used.  Oh, my God.  I have a dream today 
[01:11:30]  that we can hang pictures in ten seconds.  Where'd he go?  Did he walk out,  or is he coming back to explain?  I think he'll deal with us later.  No, I think he's coming back to explain further.  Oh, I thought he just stoned out.  Ben, go find out.  I thought he pulled a rock on us.  All right.  Wow, what's that funny?  Yeah, he is coming back.  All right, so, Old Dirty,  what else you got?  Anything?  Nothing, my brother.  Are you congratulating me on my new eyes today?  Yeah, B.  All right.  Word up, man.  I don't know.  I could easily just punch you in the face, 
[01:12:00]  because when you had your glasses on,  I kind of feel sorry for you.  All right.  All right.  Here it comes.  He took all the photos down.  They're all down.  Now, here's my challenge.  All right, he's got a challenge.  Here's my challenge to you, okay?  Now, I'm going to set the pattern, all right?  You're going to have to put them in the exact pattern.  It's like Simon says.  In less than what?  Six hours?  No, that's a challenge.  You're going to have to do it by yourself. 
[01:12:30]  All right, first, can we get our own person that we want to do it?  Can we get a chimpanzee here to do this?  No, the challenge is out to the four people in this room.  All right, to put up six pictures in less than six hours.  But it's got to be the pattern.  So basically, it averages an hour per picture to have you.  Right.  Okay.  Plenty of time.  You guys got all day, kid.  Goddamn, Earl.  He's all pissed off.  I am upset because, you know, I can't. 
[01:13:00]  It looks great.  I can't grab for it and nobody helps me.  Look, he's really getting mad.  Earl, relax.  It's okay.  Come on, Earl.  I have a dream someday we'll be judged by the content of our character  and not the speed at which we hang pictures.  I want to go get the double-arm transplant guy,  and I guarantee he'll do it in less than six hours.  Before the transplant, he'll do it in six hours.  I'm just saying that we had it up in like, I would,  I had it up in probably like a half an hour time. 
[01:13:30]  Can we please, okay, you know what we want to get out here.  Could you please find me a profoundly retarded individual on the street?  I mean a drooling mongoloid.  Get that person up here with a hockey helmet on you.  And hang them pictures in less than six hours.  I'm convinced if the right weather conditions happen,  they will hang themselves in six hours.  A gust of wind in the right place, maybe an earthquake.  And they can hang themselves.  No, and it didn't take six hours. 
[01:14:00]  And when we had it up in like, what, 30 minutes,  and then they kept saying, well, we want it a certain way.  By the time it kept going back and forth, it took all morning.  This is corporate America at its best.  If Earl had a hammer, he'd hammer in the morning.  He'd hammer in the evening.  Because that's how long it took to hang the pictures.  All frigging day.  And it's putting cold.  Yo, what's his excuse for working today?  He was hanging up the pictures.  No, he had to get some other work done.  Yeah, he's just in today. 
[01:14:30]  Earl, the ceiling that you're looking up through is glass.  So if you continue to do more that you're doing,  you're not going to move up, bro.  You are not going to spend time at home today reflecting on the Reverend Doctor,  Professor, HVAC, Technician, Martin Luther King?  Earl came into work today because he's redesigning his office.  He wants his chair just right in front of his computer.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Throwing these laid-out chalk lines. 
[01:15:00]  You know, there's many patterns to try to figure out there.  You got that guy with the tripod on the highway with that measures to the...  What do you call those?  Oh, come on, Earl.  It's funny.  Look, he's not.  I have a dream today.  We're very proud of the pictures.  It represents the station very nicely.  They're off the wall, man.  All right.  Now they're off the wall.  It's going to make another sick tower.  I'm not touching them.  I refuse to do anything with these photos anymore. 
[01:15:30]  All right, Earl Dirty, hold on a second.  I ain't going to count that in a man.  Paul, what do you have?  Hey, yo.  Hey, Dopey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  You know, it makes sense now why Scott usually hired this kid.  The guy in shoes, he can't do nothing but pick up on the phone and say hello.  What a dude there.  He can't do nothing.  Earl does more than that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He also hangs up the phone when he's done talking.  He's just not an interior decorator, I guess.  Oh, I don't know.  Anyway, I'm going to see you guys Wednesday because I think if Thursday when The Rock comes 
[01:16:00]  down and kicks you guys' asses, especially Anthony, I might as well you don't get my  money on Wednesday.  All right.  I'll see you guys Wednesday afternoon, man.  All right, Paul.  Later.  Of course, referring to the fact that The Rock is coming back on our show this coming Thursday,  Anthony.  Thursday, we're going to get a visit from The Rock again, and I guess we'll straighten everything  out.  Right.  I don't know.  And Stephen Lynch coming in tomorrow.  Oh, yeah?  And I believe some day this week, Laura Korn, one of our favorite guests of all time  coming in.  Yes.  To discuss sex.  Let's take a break. 
[01:16:30]  Thank you, Earl.  He's all sad, is he?  Come on, Earl.  Earl, it's okay.  These people just don't.  It's all right.  It's okay.  He's really fast.  Hey, let's go put up the pictures.  We've got a couple minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah, go put up the pictures.  It should take your work.  Dirty spot.  Sixty seconds.  Let's see if you could.  I have a challenge for you, Ant.  All right.  He took all the pictures down.  Yeah.  Put them up before we get back from commercials. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  All right.  Let's try.  Ready, set, go.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Drone men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  1027.  WNEW.  1027, WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey.  Anthony back in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  He completed his mission.  He hung six pictures. 
[01:17:30]  It wasn't just hanging him either.  He had taken all of the nailed in clips out of the wall.  Okay.  So I had to go back there and actually nail the clips back in the wall and then hang the  pictures on the clips.  All right.  Yeah, John.  If you're just tuning in, it's something that is bothering the whole staff at the radio station.  Earl last week took all day to hang six pictures around a WNEW logo in our lobby.  That's where we're trying to, you know, get some decorations on the wall finally. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  And Ant thought he could do it within one commercial break, and it looks like he completed his job.  Earl?  Oh, yeah.  Earl?  Yeah.  You're going to walk down the hall and check Anthony?  I've already been down there.  All right.  Well, go down there.  Go down there with your phone.  Can I pick you up here?  Earl?  Guys.  All right.  Who's that?  Hey, Rick.  All right.  Yeah.  Rick's down the hall to check out Anthony's work with Earl.  Earl's going to let Anthony know if he did a good job. 
[01:18:30]  I hope so.  All right.  And, Earl, what do you think of your work?  It looks very good.  It looks good?  It looks very good.  It looks good, right?  There you go.  Yes.  Earl, it took Anthony, honestly, five and a half minutes.  Yeah, but they used the pins that I used.  They already used the original pins.  It was a piece of cake.  The original pins. 
[01:19:00]  Well, not the original pins.  They used the holes as the markers.  All right.  So let's say to grab a tape measure, measure off the ceiling and mark off a few spots on  the walls, add an extra 10 minutes to it.  That's 15 minutes.  Now what?  Well, you also have to take into consideration.  We had it up already.  They made us take it down and redo it.  All right, Earl. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  But you're happy with Anthony's work?  All I can say is you had to have been there.  Okay.  I guess everyone can understand in Radio Land why it would take somebody well over six hours  to take six pictures.  It didn't take six hours.  Hour per picture.  Yeah.  No, it didn't take six hours.  All right, Earl.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  He's pissed off.  He's all pissed, man.  He had to bring it up on the air because everyone's like, oh my God, it's five o'clock and he's 
[01:20:00]  still going.  He's still just hanging in the picture.  Wasn't everyone talking about this man around the office?  Everyone was talking about it.  I wish Mark was here because Mark went ballistic.  He doesn't even work directly with it all.  And he just went crazy on me.  You know, it's pretty funny.  I liked the level.  That was my favorite part of the picture hanging thing.  The funny thing is, Pete doing it with the level was one of the funniest things I've ever  seen.  Him and Pete first thing in the morning, they got the level.  You know, it should go this way.  It should go that way. 
[01:20:30]  I'll be the first.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I've never done this before.  You've never hung a picture before?  No.  I never had to.  There isn't a picture of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King hanging in your apartment?  No, there is not.  Stop it.  No velvet black Jesus?  Velvet black Jesus.  All right.  I'm Al Reed.  Reverend Al.  Big picture of Reverend Al.  So I guess you learned a new trade, Earl.  How to hang pictures.  Picture hanging.  You learned something. 
[01:21:00]  Scottson never told you, hang that picture of me and John Lennon up in my office.  Nothing like that?  No.  Next, we're going to teach you how to alphabetize.  Stop it.  It's like you're coming to her and you just catch hell every single free time.  Oh, no.  Vinny, what's up?  We lost Vinny.  He had something for you, Earl.  Actually, a bunch of people are sympathizing with you out there.  Rob, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  I could paint six paintings in six hours. 
[01:21:30]  Who am I?  Hang six.  I could have put up this sheetrock and painted it.  I could have painted and hug them.  You guys suck.  All right, Rob.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, um, Obi.  Yeah.  You better watch out, man.  You might take the picture in the frame, smack it in your head.  You'll lose your eyesight again.  You'll be all shat.  Earl's got big knuckles, so I heard.  Earl will be okay. 
[01:22:00]  Right, Earl?  Earl?  What if we get the psychofactor, man?  He might get you with a picture.  All right.  Look, he's all bummed out now.  Thank you, Paul.  Earl, don't be bummed.  We all know our roles here at WNEW, and sometimes it's pretty ridiculous.  You know.  You all right, Earl?  I'm fine.  I'm just like, what's wrong?  I'm just surprised you're here.  Yeah, it's MLK Day.  You shouldn't be sad on MLK Day. 
[01:22:30]  We couldn't take off because, quite frankly, we're white.  But, uh...  Dan!  Yeah, how you doing?  You should have done.  All right, what's up?  If Earl's not too busy, I'd like to ask a favor.  I'm going to have some breakfast tomorrow.  If you could start making me some toast now, I'd be done with it.  All right, Ted.  He's going to freak out.  Thanks a lot, Earl.  Later, guys.  Tall.  Earl, do you know how to make toast?  Yes, I do know how to make toast.  Just check it.  All right, Earl.  Oh, look.  He's getting all pissed.  Uh-oh.  Earl? 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  He is getting pissed.  Uh-oh.  You're not going to exude any of that, uh...  That rage.  Are you?  Go ahead and say it.  I ain't saying it on Martin Luther King's birthday.  I think Michael...  Oh, we can play the movie trailer from the 70s.  I think Michelangelo is on line 12.  Uh, Michael.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm calling from the grave and I'm wondering if, uh...  Earl has time to help me with the Sistine Chapel.  I heard, uh, you painted that, uh, quicker than Earl hung six pictures. 
[01:23:30]  On your back.  Against the ceiling.  I did that on my back and went blind at the same time.  All right, Michael.  Thank you.  That's Michelangelo, everyone.  Earl, do you want me to take a couple more of these calls?  Earl?  Oh, my God.  Why are you pissed?  Now he's pissed.  Like, no one has, you know, had to take it on the show.  Frank.  Hey, guys. 
[01:24:00]  What's up?  Hey, I got a new challenge for Earl.  I hear the new boss wants him to hard boil an egg.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Maybe he can keep Dudley up tonight at home with his pots and pans.  Oh, get out of the way.  Oh, my God.  All right, you guys.  Take it easy.  All right, bye.  All right.  John is on your side, Earl.  Uh, John?  Yeah, leave Earl alone, guys.  All right.  I love you guys, but leave him alone.  It's not like he's pinning the tail on the donkey there.  You know, they're measuring, you know, up, no, over, no, down, low.  They've got to level them. 
[01:24:30]  You know, it's hard.  You've got to space them out between them.  That's a tough job, right?  No, it's hard.  If he was pinning the tail on the donkey, yeah, Earl, do this.  I'll see you later.  You know, I bet you he'll have it done in two minutes.  Yeah.  But you've got to space them out.  He's going to go postal on you guys.  He's going to go postal.  All right.  I'm going to go down there and help him out.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Leave him alone, though.  Leave him alone.  I love you guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  A lot of people have the same question.  How do you make toast?  I wonder why.  All right, Earl.  I won't feel good unless you say you're okay before you leave the studio. 
[01:25:00]  You didn't have to develop the pictures, did you?  I was just checking.  It wasn't like Flintstones time where you had to like that.  Yeah, chisel it out.  Chisel out the pictures before you hung them.  Oh, Earl.  Come on, man.  Come on, man.  We're just messing around with you.  You know what it's like.  It's your turn in the barrel.  It's always my turn in the barrel.  Oh, very rarely.  I think we take 20 hits for everyone you take on the show. 
[01:25:30]  Not on the air, but you've never been called gay.  Yeah.  That's a fade a lot worse than hanging pictures for six hours.  Sorry.  I just thought of something funny in my head.  I had nothing to do with picture hanging for six hours.  What?  How pissed he is.  Come on, Earl.  Leave the studio so we can continue with our show.  Yeah, okay.  Happy Martin Luther King Day.  How are you going to spend it tonight? 
[01:26:00]  Anything?  Any plans?  Don't you have to thumbtack some memos in the jackal lounge or something?  Are you going to go out on a date or something?  To a fine African restaurant?  He's giving me the evil eye.  And I can see that very clearly now with my brand new eyes today.  Jesus Christ, Rick.  What did he say?  You are bad.  Bring the bell.  I said, I'm not even going to repeat it.  MLK is on line four for Earl. 
[01:26:30]  MLK.  I have a dream that one day Earl will learn to hang a picture.  Wow.  I'm privileged to have Martin Luther King on the line here.  I had to go pretty early this morning.  Very good, MLK.  Oh, there's Psycho Mark.  Get him.  Get Psycho Mark in here.  Thank you, MLK, for checking in.  Now go bang another white broad.  We've got a show to do.  All right, here comes Psycho Mark that was really outraged about this. 
[01:27:00]  Psycho Mark, you haven't been listening.  We've been talking about Earl's picture hanging.  Oh, that.  A three-day affair.  He swears it did not take him six hours.  That's crap.  It took him two days.  It did not take two days.  Two and a half days.  No, it did not take two and a half days.  Earl, you stood there for four hours with a hammer and did nothing.  No, I didn't.  That is a flat-out lie.  You are lying.  He had Pete.  You are lying. 
[01:27:30]  He had Pete.  Lying.  You are lying.  Simmer down, okay?  No, I'm not simmering down.  You are lying.  He's not lying.  You are lying.  He's not lying.  Earl, you took two and a half days.  We did not take two and a half days.  You are lying.  One day.  You are lying.  Two days and a half.  You are lying.  The chief engineer.  This guy is in charge of, like, you know, multi-million dollar equipment holding up.  You know how painful this is? 
[01:28:00]  It took Earl longer to hang six pictures than this break is going on.  What a face on Earl.  He's getting pissed.  So, Mark, seriously, how long did it take?  Two days.  He's lying.  No, I'm not.  You weren't lying.  Earl, it took, it felt like eternity.  I'll admit, it did take eternity.  We had it up in, like, 30 minutes, and then we had to take it back down.  But then on top of it, there's a big black pubic hair inside one of the pictures. 
[01:28:30]  And I'm like, hmm, I wonder who did these pictures.  Was it my pubes?  Oh, it wasn't?  No.  It was a fancy pub.  Matt, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah, I wanted to take Earl six hours on the crapper.  All right.  Earl, Earl's taking enough.  He's not happy.  Thank you, Matt.  All right.  All right.  Anything to say, Earl?  We'll let you have the final word. 
[01:29:00]  It's only fair.  Go ahead.  Earl.  Earl, everyone.  Oh, my God, he's just, like, shooting me near the looks.  Each one of those eyes had a .50 caliber.  Can't we all just get along?  And things are all stay off.  He looks like the guy from Full Metal Jacket now.  Yeah.  What's his name?  What the hell is his name?  Huh?  Private Pyle.  Private Pyle.  Hi, Joker.  Hi.  Hi. 
[01:29:30]  Earl, you got that look in your eye.  You going to be all right?  Maybe.  He's really pissed.  Uh-oh.  They did come out nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would have really been bad.  We made Ed do it.  And it sucked.  We made Ed do it during the commercial break.  Took him five and a half minutes.  Only for an hour.  We took them all out.  Took all the clips out of the wall.  And I had to nail them all back in and hang them in a commercial break.  And I was sitting here with my phones on, waiting for the last spot to end. 
[01:30:00]  Ring the bell.  Come on.  But as Earl pointed out, the holes were in the wall already.  Right.  So I knew approximately where they had to go.  Earl, are we going to solve this, or we're just going to wait for you to leave the studio?  I'm not saying anything.  All right.  Oh, come on, Earl.  All right.  You did put up a nice picture of Van Halen.  Why?  I have no idea.  No, I didn't.  You're lying again.  You did a picture of Van Halen.  You did.  There was a picture of the frog.  Kermit the frog.  There were photos. 
[01:30:30]  We had a set of photos.  I went, what do you want on this wall?  And all of those photos got approved.  The Tony pig Kermit the frog photo got approved?  No.  I think Earl's bummed because his Pam Grier photo got denied.  He wasn't allowed to hang that up there with the rest of us.  Come on, Earl.  That's right.  There was a Van Halen photo.  There was a Van Halen.  It had nothing to do with what the station is now.  But it looked good.  Listen, we've got to move on.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't like I approved the photos.  I went, what photos do you want on the wall? 
[01:31:00]  That's what I asked.  It took all freaking day for five pictures.  Six.  Five pictures.  It took six.  Six.  Six.  Okay, six.  We're talking.  This is rocket science.  Fine.  Then you do it next time.  I won't do anything.  30 seconds.  I am not going to do it.  No.  No, I'm just, I'm upset because I asked for help, got none.  What do you mean?  You had Pete and Eddie.  You had Pete and Eddie helping you.  Eddie did not help me. 
[01:31:30]  And on top of it, Earl, there were thumbprints all over the pictures.  It looked like someone smudged their face up against each one.  You didn't even bother cleaning them.  I did clean them.  There was a big black pubic hair in one of them.  A big, giant black pubic hair.  Now, when someone comes down the stairs, we have nice people come to visit.  They see a big, giant black pubic hair in one of both the Anthony's pictures.  That's a thumb stump.  Fun.  All right.  Fun.  Next time.  Wow.  Next time, we'll get you a whole staff.  No, just leave me out of it next time. 
[01:32:00]  We need overtime.  It has to be a union job.  Everybody knows everything, so leave me out of it next time.  Oh, God.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Just a minute.  It took all day.  What was it?  It did take all day.  If you were any help.  What was I going to do?  Oh, that looks good.  A little bit to the left.  No, I have plenty of places.  Some of us have work to do.  Earl, and I didn't?  Earl, obviously, no.  So, all kidding aside, why did you need someone to help you? 
[01:32:30]  I'm not saying nothing.  I will say nothing.  He had Pete, the engineer, who had to put in, like, a bunch of compressors that day.  Like, real important stuff for a radio station.  There's Pete holding the pictures up Earl.  This guy's a union guy.  He's holding pictures up Earl.  I'm like, this is ridiculous.  Now I know why you wear all black.  It would take too long to try to figure out what to wear.  Come on, that's funny. 
[01:33:00]  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Come on, that's funny.  Oh, the humanity on this MLK day.  Come on, Earl.  That's just a good joke.  Are there any assault rifles nearby?  Should we spend the Dr. Reverend, Reverend Doctor, which way does that go?  Martin Luther King's birthday.  A room full of white guys just ragging on a black man.  Is that the way we should celebrate the birthday of the Reverend Dr. G-Y-N-O-B-Y-G-Y-N?  Martin Luther King. 
[01:33:30]  Who's your doctor?  I never saw it with a stethoscope on.  Is that how we should...  Oh, come on now.  I'm out, Ray.  I better come up with Reverend Howard.  This will really seem racist.  Earl was just doing his job.  Hang in picture.  What's the problem to touch six and a half?  Sometimes it takes me that long.  At Kentucky Fried.  To go through six buckets of chicken. 
[01:34:00]  Reverend Howard loves Kentucky Fried.  Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I understand Earl's hardship.  Because it takes me that long to see if my big Volkswagen hubcap medallion is level.  It's not the same way, because my body is as big as a wall, so it's like hanging a picture.  A little to the left.  No, a little to the right.  A little closer to the right nipple.  I'm ripping out big man boobs.  But I'm outraged that a room full of white men are ragging our black brother Earl, even though he's just black on the outside. 
[01:34:30]  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right.  You guys got to stop ragging on Earl.  Okay.  Trying to do his best.  Right.  And he just wanted all the pictures to be level, making nice presentation for all your patrons coming into the place.  Just like all those quirky Steinbrenners in the store. 
[01:35:00]  You know, when they're packaging your groceries, they're taking all their sweet time.  You've got to have a little sympathy for them.  All right.  Jesus.  Thank you, Dave.  All right.  Our line, too, is nigga Charlie.  Thank you, Dave.  Come on.  Nigga Charlie checking in.  Charlie, what's up?  This here, here.  This nigga Charlie.  My brother, I don't be making nigga Charlie look bad.  Nigga, I'm taking all this long to hang up some pictures. 
[01:35:30]  I don't clean up the West anymore.  Clean up the West.  He can hang in pictures up.  Nigga Charlie can't handle this.  All right, Charlie.  I don't like this.  All right.  Thank you, Chuck.  Nigga Charlie, I've got to go.  Linda, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  How you doing?  Good.  Well, you guys are going to stop picking on Earl because it takes a while to get pictures hung properly.  First, you've got to get the architectural plan. 
[01:36:00]  Okay.  You want to make sure everything's perfect.  Right.  You know, stop picking on him.  All right, Linda.  Thank you.  Bone dry, bone dry.  Yaddle doodle.  Ah, the Greaseman stopped us for the show today.  What's up, Greaseman?  The Greaseman show on Martin Luther King's birthday.  Yeah.  It's me, the Greaseman.  I want to comment on Earl hanging pictures.  What happened, Earl?  It took a little long, did it?  I understand, though.  Sort of a handicap being a black man.  Yaddle doodle. 
[01:36:30]  What?  What did I say?  Yaddle doodle.  Bone dry, bone dry.  Yeah.  Yaddle doodle.  Yeah.  No wonder it takes him so long to hang pictures.  What?  What?  Yaddle doodle.  Yaddle dee.  Bone dry, snarlings, snarlings.  All right, to answer the story, yeah, maybe if you would have used chain-dying the pictures.  What a doodle.  What takes longer, hanging pictures or picking cotton? 
[01:37:00]  What a doodle.  Hey, jump down, turn around, pick a bell of cotton.  It's the Greaseman show.  I've got to say that a million times.  Greaseman, not Opie and Anthony, it's a character.  Mr. Iman, who's his character, is it?  All right, on the line.  Jesus Christ.  Even the Greaseman won't say that.  All right, on the line, Anthony.  Yeah?  Is the guy that gave Earl the job of hanging the pictures.  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:30]  We got right to the bottom of this.  Matt Savoti, everyone.  What's up, Matt?  I'm on the parkway in South Jersey.  I had to pull over to call you guys.  Okay.  I got to laugh at the...  Happy holiday, by the way.  Happy MLK.  Happy holiday.  Happy birthday, MLK.  Happy birthday, MLK.  Happy birthday, MLK.  Happy birthday to you.  The Greaseman show.  Waddle doodle.  I'll never get another job in radio again. 
[01:38:00]  Me, the Greaseman.  On any W.  Yaddle doodle, waddle doodle.  Bone dry, snarling, Greaseman.  Yeah.  All right, Matt.  So, you gave Earl the job.  All right.  The deal is, Mark's kind of right.  It took two and a half days.  The reason is, we asked him to print out six to eight pictures to hang on the wall in the  lobby.  Yeah.  Off the computer.  Yeah.  So, then the computer broke down.  Then our printer ran out of ink. 
[01:38:30]  And it took two and a half days, finally.  So, the day of the hanging started at 9.30 in the morning.  So, the day of the hanging started at 9.30 in the morning.  9.30 in the morning.  It went until about 4.30.  And the only reason Earl, sir, is they came in and changed their mind on how to hang them.  We drew a diagram of how to hang them, and he kept getting it wrong.  We had two half moons.  One to the left was in the shape of a C, and one to the right in the shape of a D.  You follow? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, I got you.  They both went straight up and down, and it's flat across the top.  So, finally, Pete, the chief engineer, just quit and left.  It was Pete's eye.  It was realistic, though.  He was punching lockers outside the hallway there.  He got so upset.  So much for working on that next big O.P. and Anthony promotion.  We got pictures.  Now, I'm curious, too.  This is indicative of everything that happens at that station.  How come on a holiday, Ben, Psycho, Mark, and Earl are all in? 
[01:39:30]  Nothing better to do.  All right.  Very good, Matt.  Anyway, my brothers, have a great afternoon.  You too, Matt.  Matt DeVote, everyone.  Sick boy writing in on instant feedback saying,  We better pray to God the Rock isn't listening today.  All right.  Well, thank you, Earl.  Earl, thank you.  Thank you.  Earl? 
[01:40:00]  If you're going to punch me, can you wait?  Like, I need five more days for my eyes to heal.  Earl?  Hello?  All right.  He's not talking to us anymore.  We used to do jobs that were called prevailing wage jobs.  So, let's say you'd make normally $10 an hour, not content, maybe $15 an hour.  These prevailing wage jobs, $50 an hour.  You'd get at these job sites where they'd have to pay these wages. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  We would milk these things for days and days on end.  I swear to God, it could be something as simple as, you know, you've got to put a 24 by 24 return grill in the ceiling.  Should take half hour.  Two days later.  You've got to make sure it's straight.  You've got to make sure it's level.  You've got to make sure you're getting $50 an hour.  So, you know, if that was the case, Earl, then I truly do understand. 
[01:41:00]  Earl?  Earl, if you're not going to use your mic, you've got to leave the studio.  Yeah.  He's breathing really heavy.  We can hear that.  He's pissed.  Earl, we've got to move on with the show.  You want to move on?  We're giving you the last word.  If there's anything you want to say, I remain silent.  All right.  Then with that, we've got to take a break, okay?  Let's move on from the Earl thing.  We're done with Earl.  Okay? 
[01:41:30]  Earl?  Yes.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fast!  107 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  This is 1027 WNEW.  We're going to try to move on from Earl.  212-757-1027 if you have anything.  Mike from Manhattan on the instant feedback.  Opie, according to my calculations, your doctor could have restored vision to about 24 people  before Earl could have hung six lousy pictures. 
[01:42:00]  MLK would be proud today.  Earl's really pissed for the first time.  I know.  He is truly pissed.  Matt, what's going on?  Yeah, really quick, get the bell ready, guys.  I figured out why Earl couldn't hang the picture so quick.  Yeah.  Because he's got a natural fear of any kind of hanging.  Oh, come on.  Thank you very much.  That's wrong.  Thank you, Matt.  Jesus Christ.  One of their phones. 
[01:42:30]  Timmy, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, how you doing?  What's going on?  All right.  Listen, you guys better rip up Bob Shannon up on 101.  Why?  Because he was just ripping you guys up.  I was flipping through the stations while you guys were on break.  Yeah.  And he said that they wouldn't tell you the newspaper that they just cloned them to monkeys.  Uh-huh.  Because now that you guys, now they have somebody to take your guys' place, you guys should take a break.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Everybody's talking about the Opie and Anthony show.  We don't mind.  We don't care.  Keep talking.  All right, guys.  Later.  Thank you. 
[01:43:00]  CBS.  CBS taking jabs at us?  Yep.  Isn't that the oldies, right?  That's the elephant graveyard.  Yeah.  That's where the old jocks go to die.  Hello, love.  All right, guys.  Later.  All right, man.  CBS now?  We must be getting popular.  CBS is now taking shots at us.  Donald, what's up?  How could they even do that?  Isn't that just the music station?  Don't they have, like, strict rules?  Who knows?  You know, you're supposed to just seg the songs, shut up, maybe talk about how cold it is out, 
[01:43:30]  and go to the next Shirelle song or something.  You have to go around the corner.  Hey, Donald, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I was just listening to CBS.  My uncle had it on.  He said they cloned twin monkeys.  Yeah.  And he said Opie and Anthony can take a vacation now.  Keep talking about us.  That's pretty funny, though.  I can't believe it.  You guys are great, man.  Thank you.  You guys are fantastic.  Hey, how come you never show up down at all those WOW shows over here in New White Park, man?  When WOW gets going again, we'll be all over the place. 
[01:44:00]  I hope so.  We're going to see you guys.  All right, Donald.  Take care, man.  Bye.  You've got to give him something, because that's a pretty funny line, though.  It's a funny line, but give him that one.  If you're going to try to, like, get to us, you've got to come up with something a little bit more than that.  CBS FM!  Hello!  They cloned a couple of monkeys.  Looks like Opie and Anthony could be taken to vacation.  Hey, get some CBS music.  We'll do it how they did it, probably in between records, because they only get, like, 15 seconds to do their shtick, Anthony, you know? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, let's see if we can talk it up like they do over there.  I wish we had the echo.  We need the massive echo chamber.  Oh, where it sounds like you're, like, playing basketball in the gym and doing a radio show at the same time?  Yeah, you're on a basketball court, it sounds like.  All right.  Wow.  Hello, love!  We don't have that, though.  I don't know why they do that.  God, we must be pissing off just everybody in this business.  Well, our pals at the radio message board, the industry little dumping ground for all the people, all weekend long. 
[01:45:00]  And today, once again, we're just the popular post.  All right, Ant, you want to be the CBS FM DJ?  What song is it?  Dissing us, Joy to the World.  Oh, yeah?  Guess you have to do it right up to the post, Anthony.  Okay, I'll try.  Hey, CBS FM, it's Harry Balls here.  Oh, this is a short intro.  Yeah, we need a long intro.  We need a much longer intro than that.  I can't say who I am, the station, and rag us.  Yeah, we got a, how about a little, uh, hmm, let's see, how long is the intro to, like, knock three times? 
[01:45:30]  I don't know, let's see, let me see.  Hey, Harry Balls here, CBS FM.  You know, I'm reading they cloned a couple of monkeys and the music's coming in now.  We don't have enough time.  We got one?  Gotta have a long intro.  No, no, really, we needed, like, 15 seconds. 
[01:46:00]  Ollie?  Yeah, that could work.  All right, here we go, Ant.  Give it a try.  Ready?  What is it?  Ollie's.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Snatch with you, CBS FM.  I'm reading in the paper today that they cloned a couple of monkeys.  Looks like Opie and Anthony are going to be able to take a vacation.  The Hollies, blonde, cool woman in a black dress.  This one taking you right back to September 1972. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, that's not bad.  Oh, yeah.  Bravo.  Didn't have any more to babble.  All right, well, you want to do, like, a little, uh, weather break?  Here, do a quick weather break over Joy to the World.  Well, this is what real DJs do.  We can't even imagine doing any of this stuff for real.  Ready?  Yeah.  Hey, Camel Toe here.  You just got the wrong song on, big Opie.  All right, give me this one.  This is that other.  Oh, my God.  This funeral dirge.  That's what they play over there, though. 
[01:47:00]  This crap?  Yeah.  Why do we even have these CDs?  All right, talk this one up there.  Which one is it?  Evil Ways?  They don't play this up there, don't they?  They don't play this, Rick.  You got to play those cheesy.  Rick doesn't know the business, man.  Yeah, you got to play them.  They play, like, the worst music ever.  Snotty, moldy oldies. 
[01:47:30]  Like, they play this.  Do a quick, quick weather break.  You don't have much time here.  Ready?  Ugh.  Hey, Harry Snatch with you.  Going to be a little cold today.  Make sure you put on your sweater CBSFF.  Hey, girl, what you doing down?  Oh, ho.  You're going to be freezing your testicles.  You're going to be sticking to your ass crack.  I've lost my frigging mind working here at CBSFF.  Oh, ho. 
[01:48:00]  How you doing, people?  Remember, it's really cold outside, so put on a sweater, or you'll end up break down.  It's like Opioid Anthony.  Look, I'm talking over the music.  I'm going to get fired.  Miss Taberabank.  Miss Taberabank.  Miss Taberabank.  I like the Shatner version better.  CBSFF. 
[01:48:30]  Miss Taberabank.  All right, you're getting better as we go along here.  What the hell is this?  Ho, ho.  Gypsy Swanson Horse.  On CBS.  In the wagon of a traveling show.  My mama used to...  That's all they get to say, though.  Like, that's pretty much the gig over there.  You just got to do everything you've ever wanted to say in your life in, like, three seconds.  You don't even get a chance there. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, that one, you don't.  Here, try this one.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Sack with you on CBSFM.  You know, they cloned a couple of monkeys, and I can't talk about it because the music started.  I wish I was over at Eddie W.  See, he had to...  They don't give a crap.  He had to pick the perfect song to do it.  Yeah.  I think this one would do it for you.  Here you go.  Hold on, man.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Sack with you.  Coming up next, nine-year-old boys with no teeth. 
[01:49:30]  Next on CBSFM.  Hey, you hit the post there, my brother.  That was the one.  Very impressed with that one.  All right.  Wait.  Let's try this one.  Remember the Cher song?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Hey, everybody.  CBSFM.  I like doing oral on my dog. 
[01:50:00]  It's the Cherokee people.  CBS.  Oh, Cherokee.  CBSFM incense and peppermint.  Drop me your alarm clock.  I got my finger in my ass.  CBS.  CBS.  Oh, these boots are made for walking or sticking in my butt crack. 
[01:50:30]  That's the Sinatra CBSFM.  You keep saying you've got something for me.  You never close your eyes.  You're evil in the right.  You're evil in the right.  What a tool.  Keep talking about us.  We can care less.  That is a talent, though.  You've got to give him that.  One, two, three, four. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, everybody.  Hairy snatch with you.  Wully, bully.  That's how I like my girls with a big hairy gash.  CBSFM.  Hey, everybody.  Jake goes in in you.  We're going to be happy together with the turtles.  Uh-oh.  I screwed up again. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, Dick is in you here on CBSFM with the Bunkies.  Wow, that was an easy one.  Hey, cream in your snatch here.  On CBSFM, I like hairless 10-year-olds. 
[01:52:00]  On CBSFM.  Oh, it's windy outside, isn't it?  And pretty cold.  Make sure you wear your sweater.  I like catching, uh, catching hubbers.  I'm catching one right now under the console from Wendy's CBS. 
[01:52:30]  I can get a job over there, right?  I think you can, man.  As long as you can goof on stupid stuff.  You've just got to say inane crap in between all the crappy music.  Hey, everybody.  Harry Crotch with you. 
[01:53:00]  And, uh...  Oh, I was just looking at the name of the song.  Well, it's a tricky job.  I keep stepping on the words because I'm diddling myself.  CBS.  That's some gig they got over there, though.  But if all you had to do was, like, during the music,  plan out what you're going to say over the...  And listen to the beginning of this song playing time. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, the Osmond brothers.  You know, I'd like to, uh...  I'd like to anally rape the youngest one.  CBS.  CBS.  That's a good one. 
[01:54:00]  Too funny.  I think we've run out of songs.  Oh, did we?  Oh, hey, Rick's got 1963 coming up.  Yeah.  Okay, here we go.  Where is it?  Here we go.  Hey, everyone.  Dick inside you here at CBS FM.  Remember, the Namblin' Convention this weekend 
[01:54:30]  if you like the hairless little nutsacks.  CBS.  CBS.  I don't even care if people aren't crying this funny, man.  We can do this for another five hours.  We're trying to find music as fast as we can.  Let's see. 
[01:55:00]  Let's try this one.  Hey, everyone.  Sacking balls with you.  You know, ever since I passed 60,  my sack is like melted Turkish taffy.  I got to tell you,  Agent Gravity, it's a bitch.  CBS FM.  You hit the post there pretty good.  I try.  I stepped on a little bit.  Okay.  Hey, everyone. 
[01:55:30]  It's your good pal, Phil McCracken.  Over here, CBS FM.  It's the association.  This one taking you way back.  Reminds me of the first time I had a man's unit in my face.  CBS.  CBS.  He went away, and you hung around.  Hey, shut up, bitch.  I got to talk over you. 
[01:56:00]  And not even go after you.  You said things that weren't very bad.  My boyfriend's back, and there's gonna be trouble.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, Tom.  My boyfriend's blushing.  But I don't know.  Hey, Tom.  Oh, brother.  Yeah, it's the Jackson 5 CBS FM. 
[01:56:30]  That's when he was a black man,  as opposed to when he is now a white woman.  We've run at it, too.  It's like...  Wow.  Even Earl's laughing.  Earl, you got the echo?  Hello, hello?  Does that actually work?  Hello?  I just hear static.  Hello, hello, hello?  Nah, it doesn't work that good.  Damn, I wish we had that.  Oh, there it is.  All right, here we go.  Hey, whoa!  Wait a minute! 
[01:57:00]  Very good.  No, make it nice and loud for...  Hey, everyone.  Kwan Ball here.  CBS FM.  I'm here in a gymnasium.  And I'm hoping to find a few underage girls to bang.  CBS.  I can't hear the music on this echo.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, Michael, I'm going to go for it.  Right back in 1976.  Oh, John Kiki Dean.  Don't go breaking my heart.  And I remember her yelling,  Don't go breaking my heart.  The CBS.  Don't go breaking my heart.  I couldn't if I tried.  Hey, Anthony, pass me the ball. 
[01:58:00]  I want to take a couple shots  as we're in this gymnasium doing the radio show.  All right, let's play a game of horse.  Okay.  What a joke.  See, even Earl's laughing.  We're all back together, guys.  It's CBS.  Goddamn.  Hello, love.  Hello, love.  Ronald and me.  Hello, love.  I am BB. 
[01:58:30]  Harry Harrison.  We're getting fired for this one.  All right, ready for another one?  You can't rag on the legends.  Where's my echo, goddammit?  Where's the echo for the man?  Yeah, this will take you back, 1972.  Three Dog Nights, black and white.  Oh, that's how I like them.  Black.  Yeah.  I don't have anything funny to say to that, Hopper. 
[01:59:00]  That's all right.  I need a good song about, like, effing.  Hey, do that one.  Track one, man.  That's a hit.  That's a CBS FM hit right there.  What, track one over there?  On this one.  Let me see.  Let me turn on your echo for a second.  I love the echo.  Hold on.  We might have to start using that here.  M-A-W.  John, what's up?  I tell you, I'm laughing so hard, I'm about to have an angina.  I know it's inside, but that puts me in the same age group as the DJs on CBS. 
[01:59:30]  All right, very good.  Thank you, John.  Here goes, John.  All right, turn up Ant's echo again.  Here we go.  Where's my echo?  We just said this by Willow and it's a heavy video echo.  Oh, wow.  Hey, is this a live cut?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, everyone.  And that's John on CBS for the Billion of the Jets. 
[02:00:00]  You know, on this part of the King's birthday, I'd like to say, I think the Klan has some good ideas.  CBS FM.  Okay, hold on.  This one's good.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  And these old CDs won't even queue up.  It won't queue up, man. 
[02:00:30]  It won't queue up.  It won't queue up.  These things are so freaking old.  Glenn, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Guys are so freaking funny.  I was driving around at the AAA road service, and I had a cigarette in my hand.  I almost burned myself and ran off the road.  So freaking funny.  Thank you, Glenn.  All right, man.  You guys are doing great.  All right, bye.  Bye-bye.  I like the echo. 
[02:01:00]  Is that coming in good?  There it is.  Ready?  Yeah.  Hey, everyone.  Little Avon's The Woke Emotion.  This one's coming out August 1962.  I'm Buster Hyman.  See me again.  What?  Andy, what's up?  You guys are doing me.  I'm at 17, and me and a guy next to me who was obviously listening, because he was laughing 
[02:01:30]  and his ass off, too.  Almost hit each other on the highway.  Hey, is the echo coming through good?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  All right.  Thank you, Ed.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  Here we go.  Hey, everyone.  It's Haywood Jabolby here on CBS FM.  This one, Billy Bresson going back to 1974.  Nothing from nothing.  You know, I think Adolf Hitler was a good guy.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS. 
[02:02:00]  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  He's trying to get his ideas in quick.  Hey, Frank.  Yeah.  What's up?  Do you guys think this actually is hysterical, huh?  Yes, we do.  Do you think this is really funny?  Yes.  Our caller, Frank, you're on the air.  This is really, it's, I've been listening to you guys.  It's me, Justin Sider. 
[02:02:30]  I don't think it's funny that, you know, CBS FM is a station that's responsible for bringing  rock and roll to this city.  Ho, ho, Frank.  Looks like Hitler missed a few.  CBS.  It's not funny, man.  It's just not funny.  It's not funny.  You're saying it's not funny.  It's not funny.  It's not right, man.  It's just not right.  Is my echo coming through?  Because that's all that matters.  If your echo's coming through, you need a little bit more if you want to know the truth.  All right, Frank. 
[02:03:00]  What's the beef with that on the station?  I don't understand it.  I don't understand it.  Why are you mocking on CBS FM?  And a dedicated to him will play just a little understanding.  Take you right back to 1962, Frank.  We understand you.  We're listening here at CBS FM.  Hey, we might as well take care of, you know, take advantage of this gymnasium.  Let's play a game of handball while we do our radio show.  Got some handball there?  Since we're broadcasting from a gym. 
[02:03:30]  What is the purpose of the echo at CBS FM?  CBS.  It's to help enhance my voice so you can't tell them 101, just like our frequency.  101 CBS FM.  God damn.  I didn't want to apply for a job over there.  Wait, you missed a good one over here, too. 
[02:04:00]  Hold on.  All right, you ready, CBS FM, DJ?  Yeah, whatever.  Ron Luddy, CBS FM.  How you doing, people?  This one's going to bring back some memories of those black exploitation films.  What is this?  Is it even a swat?  I thought it was sad.  I could talk through the whole thing, because there's no words in this song. 
[02:04:30]  So I could talk it up right to the end.  Hey, let's go touch some children.  CBS.  I bet Frank didn't like that one.  Frank that just called in didn't like it, because he's a child toucher.  CBS.  Hey, Frank Dildo here. 
[02:05:00]  This one's going to be taking you all the way back to 1974.  It's David Essex.  Rock on.  And boy, I got a rock hard one here in my head.  Just thinking of passing by the junior high school earlier.  CBS FM.  CBS FM. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, yeah, here we go.  Party like there's no tomorrow.  It's Phil McCracken here at CBS FM.  This one's a champ.  Tequila.  I like drinking a lot of tequila and sticking my number where his cousin belongs.  Maybe next time I'm going to be your own keister.  Let's go out and sip some young daddy.  Come on, Lindsay. 
[02:06:00]  CBS FM.  CBS FM.  Yeah, Harry's back here.  It's Paul Eicham.  Lonely boy.  I'm pretty lonely, too.  I'm just a lonely boy.  Uh-oh, I ran out of music there, Olby.  What would happen if that actually happened on CBS FM?  I just keep jogging.  I'm so lonely.  I got blue balls.  CBS.  I got it. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, Jizz, stay with you here on CBS FM.  Remind you to everyone, do a public service announcement.  Get those herpes vaccinations, because you don't know who I'm going to be bagging.  Oh, CBS.  CBS.  Hey, it's wake up little Susie, the elderly brother.  I like them when they're asleep. 
[02:07:00]  I can bag them, they never know.  It's CBS.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  It never ends.  Maurice, what's up?  How's it going?  All right.  Miss Tambourine back.  Oh, yeah.  Miss Tambourine, man.  Yes.  What's up, Maurice?  Not too much.  All right.  Uh, I'll tell you, you know, sounds just like CBS. 
[02:07:30]  Okay.  Thank you, Maurice.  Um, what song are you going to have on next?  Okay, there goes Maurice.  Uh, Artie, you're next on, uh, WNW, actually.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  WNW, Artie, you're on.  All right, I hated those guys when I used to listen to them as a kid.  This is the funniest skit I have ever heard in my whole life.  We're going to get jobs over there at CBS FM.  You guys are much better than those clowns that used to be over there, I'll tell you.  Hey, Bloody Anus here on CBS. 
[02:08:00]  And I want to remind everybody, the NAML convention this weekend.  Don't forget, tight little supple buttocks.  Sponsored by us here at CBS FM.  Nine-year-old boys, not a hair on their sack.  Gio.  Yeah, man.  What's up, Gio?  How you guys doing?  Good, what's up?  Make it fast.  Yeah, listen, I want to hear some beach boys.  Can you hook me up with some beach boys, please?  Yeah, let's find some beach boys.  Request.  Go on, Harry.  Can Harry Sack hook me up with some beach boys, please?  Harry Sack, Gio will hook you up with some beach boys. 
[02:08:30]  All right, Harry, thanks, man.  Hey, Gio, where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Manhattan.  Oh, wait, if I'm going to be in on this, I've got to have an echo, too.  Oh, okay.  Gio from Manhattan.  I want to hear some beach boys.  Let's go surfing now, everybody.  Yeah.  Now come on and support it with me.  I'm going to enjoy it.  Early in the morning, we'll be starting now.  Hey, they talk too much.  Yeah, we need, like, an intro for Harry Sacks.  In the meantime, we'll get to Gio's request in a second, 
[02:09:00]  but here's another one for everyone out there in Radio Raya.  Hey, everybody.  Claude Balls here.  Frankie Avala.  From 1959, Venus.  Rads with penis.  What I like having in my face.  CBS.  Venus.  Penis, if you will.  We send a little girl to me.  Yeah, I like the line in that song. 
[02:09:30]  I'm going to apply for this job over there at CBS.  Anthony, what's up?  Oh, guys, man.  Five o'clock on a Monday, you got bit of the week already.  Oh, my God.  I'm driving down Sunrise Highway.  You're killing me, man.  No one else will play this four times this week.  Guys, man, you're the best.  All right, Anthony, thank you.  Peace out.  Everyone, from 1958, the teddy bears. 
[02:10:00]  To know him is to love him.  And to know...  Well, now we're getting the request coming in here.  That was great.  Andrew, what would you like to hear this afternoon?  Listen, Bloody Anus, could you play a little Three Dog Night for me?  Andrew wants to hear some...  Where's my echo?  Oh, sorry.  Andrew wants to hear some Three Dog Night.  I remember I had a Three Dog Night once.  One on my face.  Another one I was bagging.  And the other one was licking me. 
[02:10:30]  You know where.  CBS.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Andrew.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, this one.  James.  Baby Cortez.  It's called the happy organ, this song.  I have a happy organ in my pants.  Just thinking.  Oh, there it goes all over the console.  CBS.  Just had an accident. 
[02:11:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.

Yeah, how you doing, Opie Anthony?  All right.  How about an Ants Backwards Oldie from CBS FM?  Oh, a Backwards Oldie, huh?  How does the Backwards Oldie work? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you play something backwards and someone has to guess what it is?  That's it.  All right, we'll have to do that.  You guys are great.  The Backwards Oldie.  All right, thank you.  The Moldy Oldie.  Mike, what's going on?  Dude.  Yeah.  Hey, I got a request.  I want to hear some Stevie Wonder.  I don't want to know when the Cousin Brucey Hour comes on.  Jake.  All right, bye. 
[02:12:30]  Bye.  Hey, big dick is in you here.  It's the Crass 16 Candles.  I love you so.  Suck me.  CBS.  It never ends.  Oh, it doesn't.  Elvis Presley from 1957 all shook up. 
[02:13:00]  I'm shaking my pepper and leaving a stain on the seat.  See?  Yeah.  I'll meet you.  He came in too soon.  Hey, Frank.  What's up?  Guys, seriously.  Come on.  It's not funny anymore.  Maybe for the first five seconds it was funny.  No, he just drilled into the ground, dude.  You're pissing me off.  Because, you know, you're talking about a station that's been in this market for 40 years.  Yeah, so?  This station's been here even longer.  Yeah, well, exactly.  Look what they're down to.  Look what you guys are up to.  There's a reason for that, man. 
[02:13:30]  Don't mess around with that stuff.  The music.  Oh, we just wanted to see how long it would take someone to call up and say knock it off.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, Frank.  And for you?  Can I have a request?  Yeah.  This one's going out to you, Frank.  Okay.  The silhouettes.  Get a job, you loser, Frank.  Frank's a child toucher.  CBS.  It's not funny.  It's not funny, man.  Frank says it's not funny.  It's pissing him off. 
[02:14:00]  CBS.  He's laughing.  CBS.  Frank's a homo.  CBS.  Come on.  We're just having fun.  We've run out of music, I believe.  No.  I think the Rick just can't make it stop.  One more.  Make it stop.  Make it stop. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, we've got to end up on an up note here.  All right?  An up note?  All right.  Here we go.  Clog balls here.  This one's going back to 1961.  The lion sleeps tonight for two kids.  Lion wouldn't be sleeping if I were there.  I'm into bestiality.  I'll bag anything with a hole.  CBS.  FM.  Oh, brother. 
[02:15:00]  So there you have it.  CBS.  FM.  They make fun of us with one lousy line, and we just did about an hour on that.  Yeah.  Thank you for giving us an hour of material.  Oh.  Rick, Rick, we're through.  Enough is enough.  Enough is enough.  Know when to say when.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Too funny.  Listen, I just want to know two things. 
[02:15:30]  One, when did Tubby Tom start working for CBS?  Yes.  And two, where are you guys going to be working next week?  CBS.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right, man.  Hey, everybody.  Bloody Gas here.  Saying, let's do the twist.  Just twist my sack until I scream.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS. 
[02:16:00]  Save me by my little head.  And go back to you.  Oh, yes.  I think Chubby was a fag.  CBS.  I got a Chubby in my pants.  Wow.  Okay.  Hey, Bill, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You guys rock.  I just want to say that you guys always amuse me when I'm in the car.  Greatest thing ever.  Thanks.  It's a nice byproduct of just amusing ourselves, because I think that's all we do in here. 
[02:16:30]  If it happens to amuse someone out there, hey, fine.  Oh, listen.  I turned all my friends on to listen to you.  It's the greatest thing in the world.  We think you guys rock.  I got to tell you, though, I've been waiting for years for somebody to go off on CBS FM.  My father has tortured me forever with that damn station.  That's the father's station, man, when you're in the car.  It's all, God, Dad, CBS.  Continually.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You guys rock.  Keep it up.  All right, man.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, God, that was fun. 
[02:17:00]  That was a lot of fun.  Hey, Billy.  Hey, guys.  I tell you, I got the flu, and you guys are killing me.  Don't die.  We need you.  Hey, Anthony, you know how you can make Frank happy?  How?  Stop teasing CBS.  Do WABC.  Yeah, that's true.  Remember those, like, Harry Harrison?  Yeah, when they were music over there.  Oh, my God.  Harry Harrison.  Instant replay, replay, replay. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, remember that?  They used to do the instant replay, replay, and play the same song they just played.  Exactly.  Like, back to back, the same song.  It was horrible.  Yeah, Grease is the word.  Have you heard?  Have you heard?  Again, 20 times in a row.  Oh, you sound like you're broadcasting from my colon, for God's sake.  No, it doesn't sound that big.  Oh, come on.  All right, Billy.  Hey, guys, listen, you be good.  We'll get stuff coming in tomorrow.  All right, Billy from Air Sick Productions, everybody.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Billy.  All right, we've got to take a break, Anthony. 
[02:18:00]  Okay, take a break.  One more?  Come on.  Oh, my God.  One more.  All right.  Better be good.  Hey, it's Jimmy Jones, handyman.  I'm quite the handyman myself.  I like putting my hands on any man I can find.  See the ass.  Because I'm going on.  Put them down.  We'll be right back.  Baby.  All right.  After these words.  More.  You always go one too far.  More stupidity on the way.  Stay right where you are. 
[02:18:30]  Over in Anthony.  Jack, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  He sucks.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027 WNEW.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, man.  On this fine MLK day.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, everyone's just using the initials now.  MLK.  Everyone got to.  It's Y2MLK.  Y2MLK.  Very good, yeah.  I want to throw in as many initials as I can. 
[02:19:00]  And let me read the phone number way behind your head there with my new eyes.  212-757-1027.  People enjoyed the CBS FM bit, it seems.  Yeah, a couple of people are angry with us about it.  Well, one of those guys is angry.  He's on the line.  It's Cousin Brucie, everyone.  Cousin Brucie.  This is Cousin Brucie.  What's up, guys?  Something tells me this isn't Cousin Brucie.  Listen, listen, here.  You guys be making fun of me.  I'd be having to sell carpet on UPN. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, it's carpet.  It's carpet on his head.  Oh, listen.  Who are you talking about?  Cousin Opie there?  Cousin Opie and Anthony?  Well, it was a good show.  Cousin Opie and Cousin Anthony.  Hey, cousins.  It's your cousin.  Your cousin Brucie.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Don't you guys work for CBS?  Yeah, yeah, that's the trouble.  Is that like why they make you work two to seven while every other jock at a station works a three- or a four-hour shift?  Let me tell you.  We are the best at cross-promoting our company's radio stations and TV. 
[02:20:00]  And TV stations.  I invite you to find another show on the radio that talks about their company as much as we do.  Guys, you are killing me.  I couldn't even do anything around the house for that hour.  No, they don't under – the big bosses of this company just don't understand why we will not pick on other companies.  I know.  It's so much fun doing your own.  What are you talking about?  Now we're going to get the call from the southern guy down south screaming at this bit, too. 
[02:20:30]  Here it comes.  Anthony, Anthony, now, look, you boys, you've been doing good lately.  I've kind of been appreciating the direction you're going in.  But I've got to tell you, you pick on stations in this company, we'll fire you as fast as you can look at me.  I swear to God.  Now, look, we hope you have a long and luster's career in our organization.  And don't think that just because you get ratings, that's going to keep your seats warm.  We will boot your ass as quicker than you can break.  You don't screw with the company. 
[02:21:00]  Hey, dude, they're going to have you working from, like, 6 a.m. until midnight.  That was our punishment.  That's your punishment, man.  They're going to put you in there, like, 18 hours a day.  You should hear the phone calls we get after we do bits like that.  You think that's a bit that what Ant just did?  We'll get the southern guy again on the phone.  Now, look, I thought we just talked about this.  You guys messing up with the CBS TV station last week.  I thought you learned.  They're like, we just get lucky. 
[02:21:30]  Now, Opie.  That was the station that was out there.  They're not failure.  Goddamn.  And then the CBS FM, that's the guy that was goofing on us today.  Yeah.  It wasn't ABC, so it wasn't another station.  He used to work for ABC.  Sorry.  I think that whole station used to work for ABC.  Oh, man.  It's all a big, radio's a big whorehouse.  If you could get AIDS from, like, you know, if, like, radio jobs were like sex and you could get AIDS from it, every jock would be dead.  It's just a bunch of sluts and whores going around banging each other. 
[02:22:00]  I would change names.  You end up with the same mic in front of your face like a symbolic schween just laughing all over it.  Hey, look, it's Rod Lundy.  Last week, you know, Harry Harrison was swapping on this thing.  Bunch of whores.  All right, Kevin.  You guys are outstanding.  Keep it up.  Thank you.  See you.  And to think we were going to take today off.  Sal, what's up?  What are we?  I'm doing it.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  You guys rock.  Thanks, Sal. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, I was enjoying that bit a lot.  And who are these little wusses calling and complaining?  I can't believe they were pissing and moaning about that.  Ah, because they can't take a joke.  It's a joke.  You can't dish it out, you know?  All right, Sal.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Peace.  Joe, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  E-cousins.  Yeah.  How you doing?  E-cousins.  Oh, God.  That was the sickest crap.  I mean, I'm telling you.  I mean, I think he liked it, Opie. 
[02:23:00]  What's that?  I think he liked it.  Yes, I loved it.  I practically loved it.  Let me tell you something.  CBS is like the lavest crap.  Usually, you won't even bar acknowledging those old geezers and crap like that.  It's fun.  Everybody.  I think I've got like five days worth of material on this.  Everyone's heard CBS stuff.  You know, you're in New York.  You listen to it.  Yeah.  I mean, unfortunately, I'm sick at home with the freedom flu.  Believe me, right now, I'll be riding in the street with you guys.  It's hard to keep a straight face riding it because I'm a best friend. 
[02:23:30]  I ride every day trying to keep a straight face.  I look like a lunatic with you guys.  All right, man.  I got him.  Okay.  I got that punch, Opie.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Take care.  He cursed.  He said the S word.  What do you got there, O?  Let's see.  New York, New York.  First Lady Hillary Clinton chose Martin Luther King's birthday to come to Harlem and meet  with two big New York newsmakers.  Oh, brother.  What a crock of crap this is. 
[02:24:00]  The First Lady brought her Senate campaign to Al Sharpton's headquarters for a 20-minute  speech to a packed house.  I like her big, fat, white ass.  Mrs. Clinton also met the parents of slain West African immigrant Amadou Diallo and spoke  of their ongoing misery.  She met face-to-face with Reverend Al Sharpton for the first time since she entered the Senate  race, Anthony.  Wow.  She's finally chose this day.  The meeting is believed to be a signal that after some controversy, the key African-American 
[02:24:30]  leader will support the First Lady's Senate run and not enter the race himself.  It's great.  We took her to the back room of the Apollo Theater, and me and Alton Maddox put on the  rotisserie and played three-carb money on her back.  She loved it.  I had my big Volkswagen hubcap medallion banging off the top of her head when I was banging the  First Lady.  Man, but you know, I'm not used to vaginas that are that abused and used, like throwing 
[02:25:00]  a crowbar down a hallway.  My God.  What has she done?  Well, I'm glad for Reverend Al, because he's been screaming that she hasn't met with him.  Right.  Hmm.  We played Pearl Harbor.  I laid on my back like the battleship of, what was that, Arizona, and she flew over  and blew the hell out of me. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  Wolfman Jack's on line 12.  Ah, Wolfman Jack, what's up?  Yo, Wolfman.  He's dead.  Hello.  Oh, I thought he was dead.  That's why he sounded like that.  Yeah, what's up, Wolfman?  It's Wolfman Jack.  The Wolfman's laughing from the grave.  What's up, Wolfman?  You guys are killing me.  Who the hell is that?  That's one of our cronies. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, boy.  All right.  Because we did, like, 50 minutes on CBS FM, we really got to take another quick break,  unfortunately.  All right.  We ran so late in that last segment, so hang tight.  We'll be right back.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from her private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Oh, you got to lose that weight, people. 
[02:26:30]  You packed it on for the holidays.  Now you got to take it off.  Stacker 2.  That's what...  Oh, wait a minute.  Opie, trying to get me...  I'm trying to get you the echo.  I'm ecstatic.  I know.  What did Earl hit?  We got to get you the echo, man.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, there it is.  All right.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Stacker 2.  Yeah, you put on a little extra pounds over the holidays.  You want to take that off.  You Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Hey, what else does it do?  It cuts down on your cravings to snack during the day. 
[02:27:00]  It also gives you a boost of energy, like we get here at CBS FM,  us and our 101-year-old bodies.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, CBS FM and Stacker 2.  Oh, my God.  We're getting so dang it.  Help me, Spock.  Help me, Spock.  God, that echo is heinous.  Could you imagine having to listen to that all day?  The sad part is they probably, like, broadcast in a little closet  and they need to make it sound bigger than life, so they just add echo. 
[02:27:30]  Add some echo.  Stacker 2.  God, you sound like a lunatic.  We're like children, I mean, Jesus Christ.  All right, Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah, it does the three things, Anthony.  A very good product.  They've been with us since practically the beginning.  Crushes the cravings to snack in between meals. 
[02:28:00]  It gives you the boost of energy.  And if it's called the world's strongest fat burner,  you can definitely imagine that it will burn the fat on your damn fat body of yours, okay?  Lose that weight.  They have a website, www.stacker2.com.  That's stacker2.com.  Or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Thousands have proven it works.  Oh!  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W, it's the Opie and Anthony Shoe. 
[02:28:30]  Hey there.  Having lots and lots of fun today.  Got a freezing Monday.  Yeah, it's very, very cold out there.  Yeah.  Probably worse now.  Light traffic, though.  Hopefully for you as you drive home.  It's the holiday, the MLK holiday.  Who had to work today?  Um, I don't know.  It's very tricky, this holiday, because everybody's, uh, the bosses get very paranoid to not give  the people off, because then they come off seeming like a racist. 
[02:29:00]  Like, they don't consider Martin Luther King's birthday a holiday, so they just default to  giving the staff off.  Mm-hmm.  Not this place.  I mean, it is a legal holiday here, but, like, smaller companies, like, oh, should I  give them off?  Should I give them off?  I better.  You better.  I don't want to seem like a racist.  Right.  But, we're pretty flattered, because, uh, everyone had off today.  Yeah.  A ton of people came in just to hang out with our show today.  We appreciate that.  Uh, who's this?  Sabina.  Sabina?  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  What's up, Sabina?  No, you guys are killing me.  Oh, cool.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  I turn on the radio, and I hear, uh, Anthony and Echo.  I'm looking at the station, like, where the hell am I listening?  I don't know.  I need more Echo, though, you guys.  Yeah.  It was too great.  No, I'm working.  Well, we don't want to burn out the Echo, uh, bit, you know?  We already did 45 minutes on it.  Yeah, really?  Two-part of suckers who had to work today, I was one of them.  Oh, really?  Where do you work?  I work in a kid's dentist's office.  Oh.  So, since the kids head off from school, I have...  Oh, a lot of little dental appointments. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  A lot of little biting little bastards.  Yeah, it's true.  Hey, listen, I was waiting to hear the air strike and echo on that guy, Frank, who was bitching.  Yeah.  I was like, come on, guys, air strike him.  You gotta get him.  Air strike and echo him.  I got it.  It might rattle the place apart.  Frank was wrecking our buzz.  Oh, yeah.  There's always one that wrecks your buzz.  Buzz kill.  Buzz kill.  Well, thank you, Shabir.  I didn't have one yet.  All right, cool.  Anyway, late F you to Spaz, who left me on hold for 20 minutes on Friday. 
[02:30:30]  We let Spaz have today off.  Thank you.  That is hilarious, because if anyone's racist on this show, it's Spaz, and we gave him MLK day off.  Yeah, and I'm sure Earl is very happy that you guys gave him off today.  Who's Bart Luther King?  Why do I have the day off?  I don't even know who that is.  What's his name?  Sabina, how's the traffic out there?  It's not too bad.  I'm getting on a Route 80 right now, so...  Kind of light, though?  Yeah, I'm heading north, so...  Oh.  But heading south, there was a bit of traffic.  Yeah? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Well, thank you.  All right, bye.  Bye, guys.  So, what did he do?  Like, invent the watermelon or something?  What?  No, what?  I really don't know.  He invented the secret recipe of KFC?  Who's MLK?  George, what's going on?  Oh, how are you guys doing?  Great.  Listen, you bring up Hitler.  You're bringing up the blacks.  Yeah.  I got friends that are Jewish.  I got friends that are black.  And here I am, making me laugh my ass off. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, you were laughing.  I couldn't think of it.  I want to be mad.  I don't like it.  You pick out these people.  I work with them.  They're right next to me.  I insist.  We got to listen to this on the radio.  Got to listen to it.  I got a tear coming from my eye.  Uh-oh.  It wouldn't have been funnier.  Like we said, we are equal opportunity offenders.  Absolutely.  Everyone is open to be skewered on this show.  You guys rule.  All right, George.  Thank you.  Later. 
[02:32:00]  Bye.  No one is safe on this show.  No, no, no.  You won't be hearing,  You apologize.  Yeah.  I apologize.  Yeah.  I'm just clearing the line.  So if I hang up on you, it's not on purpose.  We're just trying to move on with the show today.  Okay.  TJ, sorry.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  What else did we want to get to today?  Oh, we want to talk about The Sopranos, Ant.  Yeah.  Well, I missed it last night, the season premiere.  Why would you miss the season premiere?  You're like the main Soprano guy. 
[02:32:30]  You talk about the show.  You love it.  Well, Opie, I'm no longer residing at my old house, which has HBO.  So I'm moving into a new place over the weekend.  I was doing some painting and stuff.  And the cable doesn't come until Thursday.  I see.  Yes.  But I, oh, I got a great new TV.  Oh, it's huge.  Oh, it's huge.  How big?  You love the PlayStation on this thing.  How big?  Oh, it's like 40 inches or something. 
[02:33:00]  It's big TV.  Awesome, man.  I can't wait to go to here.  I got to get all new furniture.  I can't wait to go to your groovy bachelor pad.  My groovy pad?  You want to go?  No more figurines all over your place and stuff?  I loved it.  There shouldn't be any figurines.  What is the difference?  Toys.  Wait, Ann.  Okay.  Okay.  You did let the cat out of the bag, so I can say that you're, uh...  Yes.  What is your status right now, officially?  Separated?  Uh, yeah.  You are separated from, uh...  Yeah.  Your marriage?  Pending divorce. 
[02:33:30]  Pending divorce after 10 years.  It's going through.  Now, what is the difference between the place you were living in, which I've seen, and your  new groovy bachelor pad?  Well, uh, I wanted to make sure the kitchen had a tile floor for the, uh, radio-controlled  vehicles.  Okay.  Because, uh...  You're like, you know who you're going to be like?  Kevin Spacey from American, uh, uh, uh, beauty.  I didn't see American Beauty.  Oh, you've got to see American Beauty.  But it's like, uh...  Yeah, no, there won't be any, like, little hummels. 
[02:34:00]  No, you won't see a hummel.  You won't see any precious moments.  No precious moments or trinkets or figurines.  No, there won't be any, uh, touching family photos all over the place.  There will be stacks of pornography.  Yeah.  There will be more toys than you could shake a stick at.  I hear.  You got the brand new TV.  That's it, yeah.  And, um, I'm trying to get a hold of Rockaway Bedding.  I need a huge mattress to do some Major League banging on. 
[02:34:30]  Are you going to get, like, the swing?  Yeah, the swing.  Mirrors all over the place.  The swing to hang from your huge banging bed?  The rack.  The rack.  The rack.  A bed of nails.  Spikes, yeah.  And a guillotine so I can chop her head off.  Do you have cute little dishes anymore or no?  Paper plates.  Paper plates.  Paper cups.  You nary wash a wand.  And jet glasses?  Yeah.  That's good.  It's at Fireman's Fair glasses. 
[02:35:00]  I got to restart my collection.  I lost them in the, uh, in the breakup movie.  I lost all of my Greenlawn Fireman's Fair glasses.  Oh, that's too bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you take...  It's really a bitch.  Why don't you take those when you broke into your house?  Um, don't know.  I wasn't really thinking about it.  I was thinking computer equipment.  Isn't that great?  I got locked out of my own house.  You're allowed to talk about how you broke into your own house now, finally?  Well, I wouldn't use a term like broke into. 
[02:35:30]  I'll say I, uh, made an alternate entrance.  Well, after not being at your house for a while, you found out that the locks were changed.  Yeah, I found, uh, when I went back for my computer equipment, that the locks were changed on my house, Opie.  So what do you do?  The house you paid for.  Oh, I'm still paying rent.  Yeah.  On the house.  Yes.  She's living there, and I'm paying rent, and the bills and everything.  How about that?  That's great.  What a guy. 
[02:36:00]  And, uh, yeah, the doors were locked.  The keys, the locks were changed.  I go to stick my key in the door.  There's a shiny new lock on the door, Opie.  Shiny new.  And guess what?  My key don't fit on the place you're paying for.  Yeah.  With my stuff still inside.  With your stuff still inside.  Yeah.  So, you know, I went around back to the, uh, the back door, thinking I might be able to use my key there.  But there, again, was a shiny new lock on the back door that has glass panes on it. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  So I took the alternate entrance.  You know I fit through two 12-by-8-inch glass panes?  Very nice.  Only had to take two out.  Delicately remove them like the glazier.  I'm sure you did.  Yeah.  And I crawled in.  I swept up.  And I took my computers and my clothes.  Look at Rick looking at me, shaking his head.  And I showed up newlywed.  Look at him.  Look at Rick. 
[02:37:00]  What's your problem?  What's the matter, Rick?  Wow, Rick is really, uh, taking this hard.  Why are you shaking your head?  He's taking it so hard.  There are so many things that have happened since you went to London.  I understand.  And I've heard about things, and I think it's really funny, but maybe, uh, some people...  It's not funny.  It's real life.  Some people are listening and...  Yeah.  Could be running, uh...  So?  This is all stuff that really happened.  I don't care.  There's no...  I'm not denying that, uh, certain things happened.  All right.  Everything that happened is fine with me. 
[02:37:30]  Fine with me.  But it could be used against you.  Oh, like what?  That I did that?  What?  All of a sudden, they're going to say...  I'm going to say, I didn't, uh, go into the house that I'm paying rent in and get my stuff?  I'm just saying.  Ugh.  See, I've got to take his mic off.  You're a bummer, man.  Go ahead.  You know what it is?  You're a bummer.  I want to hear the stories, because it's much...  This is fun.  Go ahead.  So that was it.  So I just grabbed my computers...  Right.  ...and, uh, some clothing...  Right.  ...and, uh, fled the scene. 
[02:38:00]  Right.  I just loaded up, and then that was it.  I left her everything else.  She, you know, left her, uh, the stuff in the house and stuff.  How did you know that, uh, she wasn't home at the time?  I was just a gamble, Opie.  Oh.  Quite frankly.  I see.  If she was home, she probably would have let me, uh, take the, uh, stuff.  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I really didn't know.  I was just asking.  Why?  Did I hear from somebody? 
[02:38:30]  I don't know.  Oh, I don't think so.  I mean, who would actually call you and tell you that, you know, someone's not going to  be home?  She was gone for the day.  Who would actually call and tell you she was gone at a party for the day?  Can't imagine anyone who would do that.  I couldn't either.  Boy, that would have been handy.  If somebody would have called me and said, yeah, she won't be there.  You can go into your own house and get some of your own stuff.  Because she's at a party. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  You know, I don't think anyone would do that for you.  No, no one did that for you.  No.  Oh, sorry.  We probably shouldn't be getting into this.  So, Rick, how's, uh, how things are going?  All right.  People want advice.  How's the George Foreman grill work?  People want advice from Anthony.  Fred, what's up?  Yo.  Yo.  Anthony.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I'm, uh, kind of pending on a separation issue myself here.  I'm just curious. 
[02:39:30]  What can you tell me about how this whole thing went down?  I mean, uh, you just move out one day or how'd that go?  Uh, let's see.  What do you do?  Uh, yeah.  No, it all depends on how it started, I guess.  Yeah.  Which I can't get into at this juncture.  Oh.  Okay.  It's understandable.  Yeah, no.  If you're not a happy man.  Right.  Move on.  Before you wind up, uh, old and, uh, and not happy.  And then saying, oh, maybe I should have done something.  I figure, what the hell, you know, no kids. 
[02:40:00]  You know, I don't own a house.  So it's like, uh, that's the perfect time.  Yeah, for you it was easy.  I mean, I got.  Oh, yeah, it's easy.  I got a house I own.  I got a wife and two kids.  Oh, see?  See, no, you know what?  Then stay married.  What can I tell you?  No.  Uh-oh, the first one of these coming in, Opie, on line three.  Not good.  All right, thank you, Fred.  Listen, thank you.  All right.  Later, man.  Jane?  Hey, what's up, Jess? 
[02:40:30]  Why am I a jerk?  Anthony.  What?  You sound terrible.  Why?  How old are you?  I'm in my late 30s.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You sound like you're 18 years old.  Why?  Well, you know something.  What am I supposed to do, Jane?  I'm going to get a stack of porn.  I'm going to get a big bed to bang everybody.  You don't outgrow that stuff, Jane.  Maybe you did.  Men don't.  You don't?  No.  No, not at all.  It doesn't matter.  Like I told you, I was in a Dwayne Reed one day.  I saw this old codger walk in looking for rubbers and videotapes. 
[02:41:00]  Well, good for him.  How do you believe?  You don't outgrow it.  Maybe you beat your man down to the point where he doesn't think about it anymore.  Yeah, maybe that's it, Jane.  That you beat your man down to the point of what?  That they don't think about sex anymore?  That's not my point.  Your man looks your point.  No, no, no.  You know what?  No, that's not my point.  It's not about that.  All right, what's your point, then?  My point is how callous you are.  I mean, you obviously were in love with this woman at one point enough to marry her, and  now you could talk so callously about being away from her. 
[02:41:30]  Well, because I can't.  You make her sound like an unbelievable villain.  I mean, I know nothing about your divorce or your marriage.  Yeah, see?  You don't.  I absolutely don't.  But, my God, don't you have any feeling?  I've got nothing nice to say right now.  Anything out of decency?  Okay, yeah.  You look at the bill.  It's all my decency.  You know, I can relate.  I'm a divorced woman.  Yeah, okay.  I can totally relate.  Oh, yeah, you can relate to me.  You're the divorced woman.  The guy has to pay everything.  That's a bunch of bull, because you don't know the grounds of my divorce or these... 
[02:42:00]  Well, then he walked away from the situation, not paying anything.  And you probably wanted him to.  To pay something?  Yeah.  I walked away with myself and my daughter, and that's what I wanted.  And he wanted to keep the money, and I let him.  I walked away with dignity.  Dignity.  Well, okay, Miss Dignity.  That's very nice.  It is.  Thank you for calling.  I wish more women were like you.  Well, maybe men like you would be happily married.  All right.  Love.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:42:30]  Hey, Vin, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Excellent.  Guys, how are you doing?  First of all, I'd like to say you don't suck.  You guys rule.  You're the best.  Thanks.  Anyway, I got two things for the show.  I'm going westbound in Jersey, all right?  And the traffic is very, very weak, and I'm going very, very west, if you know what I mean.  Okay.  All right?  And secondly, I'm thinking about getting engaged, right?  But I'm not sure.  I get tremendous pressure like you have no idea, all right?  And in the back of my mind, things happened a long time ago, and there may not be a little 
[02:43:00]  bit of trust there, you know what I'm saying?  Uh-oh.  What would you do?  I'm 26.  We've been together a long time.  Who doesn't trust who?  I don't trust turning away for things.  Uh-oh.  So it makes me wonder, you know?  You know, that's like a sticking point.  You better give it a little more time, then.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  I'm just saying, but she comes up with deadlines like crazy.  I'm not.  Oh, deadlines.  Oh, deadlines.  You should never listen to deadlines.  I'm not.  You feel like you're being led into it faster than you want. 
[02:43:30]  I must have like 20 deadlines by now.  Oh, boy.  Go for a few more.  Go for a few more, right?  And get these two words into your vocabulary.  Pre-nup.  What's that, pre-nup?  Pre-nup.  Yeah, okay.  And another thing, I'm thinking I invest my money wisely.  Young, right?  And she sees it as spending and I see it as investing.  You know what?  That drives me crazy.  You know, that drives, you know. 
[02:44:00]  All right, man.  So one more thing.  Game day 2000.  I think it sucks.  Oh, really?  I haven't played it yet, man.  Yeah, don't look forward to it.  Play Madness.  I was too busy watching Jimmy Johnson practically have a nervous breakdown on the sidelines.  Oh, my God.  Woo-hoo!  62 points.  Maybe I should go to Pittsburgh because I'm a Steelers fan.  Start where he began.  Get a shot.  I think we could all agree that we were so freaking happy to see Miami get crushed over  the weekend. 
[02:44:30]  Destroyed.  Destroyed.  I turned it on the first quarter and said, what happened?  Yeah.  I said, it's over.  Yeah.  And then I couldn't pull it off from it because I love a thrashing and I hate the  golfing.  I love a thrashing.  Jimmy Johnson needs a haircut.  I had to watch every single play.  Right.  You enjoyed it, I'm sure.  Oh, without a doubt.  I feel bad for Marino.  I really do.  He's a great quarterback.  One of the best ever.  That's pretty much it for him, though.  Yeah, that's it.  I don't know.  He can do better.  But, guys, I'm going to go.  You are the best.  Watch Raw tonight. 
[02:45:00]  It's going to be tremendous.  Ah, you had to say Raw.  Ah, so, you know, it's awesome.  I can't, but the show is turned upwards.  I love it.  All right, man.  The Rock is coming back Thursday.  Right.  You should turn into The Rock.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Bye.  Later.  Bye.  The Rock.  Someone calling you a pussy on line three, Anthony.  Wow.  Evan.  Yeah.  What's up?  Anthony.  Yes.  Why are you such a puss, man?  Why am I a puss?  You moved out.  You're paying the bills, right?  Yeah.  Why don't you kick her out?  You're the man with the money. 
[02:45:30]  You're the one paying the bills.  Your name's on the papers.  Kick the bitch out.  Didn't seem like the decent thing to do.  Screw decent, man.  You're going to go find a new place.  I go through all the proper channels.  I'm trying to, you know, be a responsible adult in this situation.  So that's what I'm doing.  Hey, this is just reinforcing the reasons I wouldn't get married to my criminal, lady.  There you go.  Fortunately, I was smart enough to keep all the house papers and everything in my name only. 
[02:46:00]  You're a smart man, Evan.  Yeah, thank you.  All right, man.  Take it easy, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, Joe, you're next on WNW.  What's up?  Hey, Anthony.  Hey.  I had to do the same thing, bro.  I'm sorry.  A lot of guys had to do that.  Oh, the storm door is locked.  I finally get past that.  The door, the lock is changed.  At this point, I'm fuming.  Give it a good kick.  I'm in the house.  You kicked it in?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I get downstairs in the house, and at this point, I got to get clothes out because I got, 
[02:46:30]  I walked out of the house with a pair of pants and a shirt.  I need some clothes.  I open up the closet doors.  On the floor, they go.  I'm like, this just isn't getting any better.  She's going to take the house and rob.  I'm looking through my dresser for stuff.  The dresser drawer breaks.  I had to get out of the house with a pair of pants.  I thought I was a thief.  My own hand.  I know.  You feel like you're a thief.  It's terrible.  Dude, I know what you're going through.  I've been there for the past two years, and I've seen you at Governor's Dibb and I took  a picture with you.  Two years. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  She's with that other idiot, that's a bloated moron.  No, no, no.  Oh.  He's the biggest jerk.  He's the biggest jerk in that courtroom when he walks in.  Oh, that?  He's the biggest jerk in the lab.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that one.  A bloated jerk.  Oh, why?  You got that, too?  No, she doesn't have him, but I've seen him in the courtroom, and as soon as he walks  out, every lawyer turns to each other and goes, what an a-hole.  Hey, guys.  You guys are killing me today.  All right, man.  Have a good one.  Anthony, hang in there, bro.  I'm fine. 
[02:47:30]  See you later.  There goes Joe Anthony.  On the line, another Anthony.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, man?  All right.  I just got to let you know what you just described constitutes a burglary.  Now, how does it constitute a burglary?  You voluntarily left the house, and you broke in.  So be careful.  Be careful what you say.  Hey, hold on.  No, no, because I've looked into this and thought about it.  Yeah?  I'm paying for the house.  Nothing was in writing yet.  There wasn't even a verbal thing to come back in a couple of weeks. 
[02:48:00]  But to lock me out of my own home, I'm getting in for my stuff.  When you voluntarily leave, though, they got you a bit of bulls.  There's nothing you can do about it.  I'm fine.  I mean, everybody hang in.  They make it sound like, hang in, hang in.  I've never seen Anthony happier, to be honest with you.  All of a sudden, don't I come in with, like, a skip in my step?  Got a step.  Robin, I mean, Opie, have you been raped by your father lately?  Ripping me off.  Yeah, we're taking this Howard Stern wannabe a little too far, aren't we? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, I mean, I've been fans of both of the shows, but I think you're copying a little too close.  Do you think, what, you think this is a bit just to sound like Howard?  Well, the similarities are striking.  I know, believe me, when he announced it, I'd already been, like, out of my house for  a couple of weeks at that point, and I'm like, oh, now everyone's going to think I'm ripping  off Howard.  Oh, all right.  Well, hang in there.  Thank you, Joe.  I'm sorry.  Bye. 
[02:49:00]  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  All right, can I do the first listen to Bang Anthony's Wife?  Jesus Christ.  Can I get your old address, maybe, or phone number?  Catch you, I'm bigger than you.  You're going to have to, you're going to have to work on that yourself.  All right, all right.  Bye, Greg.  Bye, Ed.  All right.  Guy called me Greg.  That's emotional.  Carlos.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  I'm on my way to Raw right now, New Haven, and I was just thinking about why I think the 
[02:49:30]  Rock's coming back for your show.  Is Raw's in New Haven tonight?  Yep.  Are they doing it live?  Yeah, they're doing it live.  Yeah.  I hope you get some signs up there.  Get some Rock signs.  I wish I could.  Wasn't there a pay-per-view last night?  No, that's coming Sunday.  Oh, that's coming Sunday?  Yeah.  Okay.  Sam, what's up, Carlos?  Saturday, the Bay Area has your station for about two hours.  I don't know if you guys know that or not.  What do you mean?  8 and 10, they're doing like a Royal Rumble radio show in every market. 
[02:50:00]  Now, New York, for some reason, it came out as 102.7.  Well, I think the reason why Rock's coming back on is not really to do like a discussion  about what happened before.  I think this is more like a plug.  You guys should really shout them out and be like, look, I think...  WWF radio on this station.  I didn't even know.  Yeah.  Go on their website and look at their radio show coming up this Saturday.  Yeah.  If you look for the New York market, it comes at WNAW 102.7 as the station for New York  that will be carrying it.  All right.  Well, it's going to be interesting. 
[02:50:30]  They're not coming back this Thursday, and we're going to see what the hell was up his  ass when he was here last time.  I think he's trying to use you guys.  Well, we're going to make sure that we get our points across.  That's all.  All right.  Cool, guys.  All right, Carlos.  All right.  Thank you.  We have to get these out?  All right.  Let's take a break.  A lot of good calls, though.  Damn it.  If you're on hold, you're going to have to call back because we've got to give away some  wrestling tickets.  Tickets to see the WWF Raw's War at Madison Square Garden. 
[02:51:00]  On Monday, February 28th, before you can buy them, tickets go on sale Monday, January  24th at 10 a.m.  We'll take the 10th caller at 212-757-1027.  Sometimes you feel like a neck.  Booty dooty.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027-WNAW.  1027-WNAW.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:51:30]  Having a lot of fun for a day we were supposed to take off.  We were going to do more stuff today.  Oh, sorry.  Thanks.  Still lots to do on the show.  If you've got something, 212-757-1027.  What about David Letterman, huh?  I mean, everyone's talking about it.  There's not much else to really say about it.  Yeah.  But, man, I didn't see that one coming.  Yeah.  The guy takes care of himself.  He keeps his weight down.  Supposedly, he eats perfectly. 
[02:52:00]  He runs, Anthony.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The only thing he does is, like, smoke cigars.  The cigars, yeah.  But, I mean, I thought he might have been pigging out and stuff and not exercising.  It just goes to show that a lot of this is hereditary.  Genetics.  Genetics, you know.  Wow.  But he had all five done.  All five.  He had, like, a huge cholesterol count.  Yeah.  And I guess his father died when he was, like, in his early 50s.  Yeah, young.  I mean, they're pretty lucky to catch this in time, you know? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Now they're saying he might be back in two or three weeks.  That would be unbelievable.  Well, they were saying, like, three months.  Well, now, today, they said it's possible he could be back in, like, two to three weeks.  Actually, Regis was saying it this morning.  Regis, the expert on...  Regis?  On heart trouble.  Who wants to be a bypasser?  Well, what is that?  Oh, God damn. 
[02:53:00]  I don't even want to joke about that.  That's terrible.  No, I can't joke about it.  My dad had that done.  That's awful.  It's an amazing thing, what they could do, though.  They could pull some arteries out of veins out of your legs.  Don't they do?  My dad had a quad.  They take the vein.  This is going to skeeve you out.  They take the vein all the way from your ankle all the way up to your groin. 
[02:53:30]  I don't get nauseous.  And then they cut that up, and that's now your arteries leading from your heart.  My dad had it done seven years ago.  It changed his life.  Completely different person afterwards.  Really?  So, Letterman should be fine.  Yeah.  But we wish him the best.  Of course.  It's going to be weird to have, like, Letterman reruns for, what, three or four months?  Are they doing reruns?  Are they going to get a guest host? 
[02:54:00]  You would think CBS would have someone they could maybe just throw in there for a few weeks.  Yeah.  That would be kind of cool.  Like the old days.  Like when Johnny used to do.  Right.  When Johnny would take off.  When Johnny was out.  A guest host.  Yeah.  You'd have, like, you know, Joey Bishop would sit in or something.  Yeah.  They don't have a guest host for him, I guess.  No.  Um.  How else?  There's some.  What?  Big Bash at Radio City.  Hmm.  And they booed Puffy, I heard.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  A chorus of boos greeted, uh.  Rap Impresario, Sean Puffy Coates.  He's getting booed now, wherever he goes?  I think this is going to be, Mark, the end of his career, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  How the mighty have fallen.  Boy, there's a picture of the paper.  In the post.  Uh.  Star Jones.  You see this?  No.  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  If anyone shouldn't go sleeveless, it's Star Jones.  Let me see.  Does she have the cafeteria lady arms? 
[02:55:00]  Cafeteria lady.  It is a friggin' ham.  On the side of the...  Oh!  Look at that arm.  Oh!  Look at that arm.  Oh, my Lord.  Lordy, lardy.  Star.  Does she honestly look in the mirror and really think she's a diva?  I'm a diva.  She's a diesel.  Letterman needs bypass surgery.  She chugs on with that. 
[02:55:30]  God only knows what she's eating to support this mammoth figure of hers.  You know?  I love that, too.  Because she'd probably say, like, no, I just have a croissant in the morning.  Hey, Jim.  Sophie and Anthony, we got you live in the air.  How are you?  I was right there.  You want to talk to us on the air, though?  Not actually, no.  All right.  Hold on.  What's the matter?  I caught him off guard.  Hold on.  That's Jim from the WWF.  Oh, is it?  He doesn't want to talk on the air, though. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, come on.  Come on, Jim.  He's setting up.  What the?  I don't know what the hell's going on, but they're setting up the rock interview for  Thursday.  Tell Rick we want to talk to him on the air.  Coax him to get on the air.  Yeah.  Tell Rick we really want to talk to Jim from the WWF.  Don't worry.  We won't get all crazy on him or anything.  Hey, Gary.  What's going on?  How you doing, fellas?  All right.  You guys have a great show.  Thank you.  Listen, as far as the Letterman thing goes, I deal with a lot of this every day. 
[02:56:30]  It's not your diet, and it's not that he's healthy.  Most of what he has is caused by, believe it or not, stress.  When you have all five done, it's usually related to either stress or smoking.  But how does stress, like, clog the arteries?  I can understand why a quarter pounder with cheese and then extra crispy fries can get  the arteries clogged up.  Actually, out of the three things that cause what, you know, this hardening of the arteries,  diet is the least of the three. 
[02:57:00]  Smoking is the worst.  But how does the stress block the arteries?  What it does is it actually puts stress on the heart muscle.  All right.  And the stress on the heart muscle will release, like, an enzyme or change the beat of the  heart.  Your whole body is a factory.  And what it does is it just gets affected by the stress that you put on your body every  day.  Hemo the Magnificent.  Which means you guys will never have heart problems.  Oh, you should see the stress around here.  Not too much stress around here.  Yeah.  I would imagine that Anthony would probably be two, three hundred years old before anything 
[02:57:30]  happens to his heart.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, it's pretty mellow.  Uh-huh.  And you guys got to do something about spaz on the phone.  Spaz isn't even here today.  I know he's not.  That's the only reason I got through.  All right, guys.  All right, guys.  Be good and try to keep stress free.  All right.  Thank you.  Rick is in a heavy discussion with Jim from the WWF about The Rock.  We can't get him.  He's on hold.  Hey, Jim.  Jim.  Yeah.  Oh, you're listening to us in the office, I hear, in the background. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Well, we never stop.  Very good.  Really?  Can I say your last name or no?  Sure.  Jim Burns from the WWF, everyone.  In charge of marketing?  Marketing, yeah.  All right.  Yes.  So what were you talking to Rick about?  Just talking about Rock's upcoming visit to your studio.  Yeah, on Thursday.  Have you spoken with The Rock since he was here last?  Hey, Jim, turn down the radio.  I actually just turned it off.  It's almost impossible to turn you guys off, though.  I like the sound of that.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Now, have you spoken with The Rock since he visited here?  I have.  Can you visit here?  And what is his frame of mind?  He's very interested to see both of you.  He's heard just about every show since he was on.  Come on.  And in all honesty, has he heard Rock's a Pussy yet?  I think you guys should be prepared for a rock that you may not have seen the first trip.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Come on, man.  This guy could kick our ass.  But wait a minute.  Until now, you've been saying you were going to kick his ass. 
[02:59:00]  Are we allowed to use, like, the self-defense suits that the ladies put on for rape prevention?  I think there's going to be a lot of hummin' hummin' hummin' hummin' when he gets there.  Oh, no.  Look, I don't want to get beat up by this guy.  He's pretty big.  Does he have a sense of humor in that thick head of his?  Yeah, that's true.  Like, we didn't detect any sense of humor when he was here last.  Rock has an excellent sense of humor.  An excellent sense of humor.  You should see him laugh when he's beating the crap out of somebody. 
[02:59:30]  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's quite a demonic grin, actually.  Could you tell the Rock if he's going to beat me up to not hit me in the front of my face because I just had that laser eye surgery?  Well, he actually doesn't know which one's Opie and which one's Anthony.  He must be stupid.  Opie's the one that said all the bad stuff.  Who looks like an Opie and who looks like an Italian guy?  Yeah, that's real hard to figure out.  Well, I've actually been up to the studio, and I've seen you guys introduce yourselves as the other guy. 
[03:00:00]  We have been.  That doesn't screw with people.  So I've actually been witness to that.  So what can we look forward to on Thursday when the Rock makes his second visit?  Well, I think he's very much looking forward to seeing you guys again.  He's heard the Crocodile Rock riff.  Which one is the Crocodile?  Didn't you guys do a tag off on Crocodile Rock?  No, it wasn't us.  What was that?  I think that was those yucksters over at K-Rock. 
[03:00:30]  You guys will actually be held accountable for every single...  Hold on.  This thing?  Oh, I think Opie's out of it.  I've got to just make sure.  Hold on.  I hope this isn't the one the Rock is talking about.  I hope in the beginning the Rock was fun.  But before the show was done,  the boy had changed the Rock's tone. 
[03:01:00]  And he really pissed off this happy Simone.  The way he left was a real big shock.  With tears running down the face of the Rock.  Everybody thinks this whole thing's a crock.  But you must remember he's dumbers and mankind's sock.  Well, the Rockman we've been cause of it's wrestling.  And something got the Rock beat.  Someone has to tell him about it.  Cause I doubt the Rock can read.  Oh, he's going to fool us. 
[03:01:30]  That ain't no can.  You look like a Cro-Magnon man.  But you hypocrite, Rock, you have lost some fans.  Oh, my God.  Come on, man.  Jim, he didn't hear that, did he?  I hope that thing is edible.  Wait a minute.  I might actually be forced to bet on Thursday.  Now, that's from these guys that we know from Airsick Productions. 
[03:02:00]  It's not even us.  Yeah, right.  We can't take credit for that.  Fine song.  Oh, my God.  We are so frigging dead.  He heard that?  I think you guys will have a lot of fun.  Rock's going to show up on Thursday.  His limousine will pull up in front of your building.  He'll have on one of his very, very expensive shirts and sunglasses.  He doesn't really have to wear a jacket because he goes from a heated car into a heated lobby.  So, I think you'll see.  Can we have him in a locked studio? 
[03:02:30]  No, seriously.  Like, we'll just put him in another studio?  Is there time for you to build one?  Oh, my God.  Oh, I don't like this.  Well, we're not going to the grand opening on Wednesday.  We're too scared.  Come on.  We are.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's Wednesday?  It's a big, big place.  No, I'm going.  I'm definitely going.  And you know something?  I think I could sell you out, so I'll be fine on Thursday.  All right.  I better go, though, too.  I'll just talk to The Rock the whole night.  No, you know.  That Opie, man. 
[03:03:00]  I'm trying to let him understand the way it is with us.  You know.  Opie, that blonde hair.  You know how that is.  All right, Jim.  Okay, man.  Well, we'll see you guys Thursday.  Hey, good luck and get into the braids position.  Is Raw's War live tonight?  It actually is.  From New Haven?  It's very exciting.  Yes, it is.  And when's that pay-per-view?  The pay-per-view is this upcoming weekend.  Royal Rumble on the 23rd at Madison Square Garden.  You're going to be a couple of tickets?  I'm waiting live.  I'm waiting live. 
[03:03:30]  I'm waiting live from Madison Square Garden.  Can we get someone that's really cool from the WWF on our show, like Shane or someone?  Shane O'Mac?  Yeah.  That takes a little bit of wheedling and needling on my part.  We'll see what we can do.  All right, Jim.  Okay, guys.  There he goes.  Jim Byrne.  Talk to you later.  From the WWF, Ant.  We are screwed.  Oh, we are screwed.  The Rock heard the crocodile rock.  I wonder if he heard the other one.  Bart, I don't even want to.  Play Rock's a pussy.  I want to hear that.  All right, get Rock's a pussy. 
[03:04:00]  Bart, what's up?  What's up?  I saw Rock last night at the arena.  Yeah?  I'm a security guard there.  Yeah?  And you got to kick your cracker ass.  Aw.  Is that what he said?  No, I filled him in.  You guys dissed him all week long.  Right.  Because you guys, you like to diss it out to Letterman, didn't stick it to Hillary Clinton.  You didn't stick it to him when he was in the studio.  Oh, and we've admitted that.  That's why we're glad we're getting round two this Thursday.  Well, he doesn't know who's Opie and Anthony, but I told him. 
[03:04:30]  He wants to know who Anthony was.  Yeah, Anthony was definitely a lot worse.  Hey, come on.  Get out of here.  Yeah.  I told him.  Well, it's very easy to tell the difference between an Italian and a cracker Irish guy.  All right, you wiseass.  Thank you, Bart.  No problem.  Have a good night.  All right.  Bye.  The Rocks are pussy.  The Rocks are pussy.  The Rocks are pussy.  The Rocks are pussy. 
[03:05:00]  The Rocks are pussy.  Anthony wrote that one.  I did not.  Paul, you're going to have to face this.  Good guy, dude.  That's Air Sick Productions.  Adam, what's up?  This is worse than that laser surgery for you, dude.  Adam, please.  Yeah.  What's up, fellas?  You're awesome.  Thanks.  Listen, I went to the wrestling last night, and I didn't see anybody from 1027 there until  I was leaving the parking lot.  I got stuck in traffic.  Yeah.  And lo and behold, the 1027 van pulls up on the side of me. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  I had some girl, my girlfriend's friend, stick her whole entire body out the sunroof, freezing  cold, with a sign that says, ONA says, know your role and shut your mouth, Rock.  Oh, very good.  I got a couple T-shirts out of the deal.  Let me ask you something.  Yeah.  If I bring down my girlfriend's friend to wow you guys, do you think I can get tickets  to the Royal Rumble?  Is she hot?  Yeah.  Awesome pair of cans.  I don't even know if we have those tickets.  All right.  To any upcoming event.  Hold on. 
[03:06:00]  Rick will talk to you.  All right.  Thanks a lot, boys.  Kevin, what's going on?  You're next on the radio show.  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, I got to tell you what, man.  I was over at the arena last night, and I have never in my life seen more white trash  walking around in one place.  It was unbelievable, fellas.  You guys should have been there.  Where was it last night?  At the Continental Airlines Arena.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  All right.  You guys didn't see it at all?  You guys realize you guys are dead on Thursday, right? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah.  Damn.  I think a good idea, Opie, would be to bring Anthony's wife in and have the Rocks banger  in front of Anthony.  Yeah.  See if he wanted to like as much as he did the last time he was in there.  That's cute.  I think I'm going to offer the Rock my girlfriend.  That might be a good idea.  That's like a peace offering.  I'll tell you what, I'd like to give him mine, that's for sure.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  All right, dude.  Later, fellas.  What do you think?  Is a peace offering just offer the Rock Sandy?  That might work.  Please don't kill me. 
[03:07:00]  Here, do my girlfriend.  All right, they'll probably grab her by the legs and beat you over the head with her.  Oh, man.  Matt, what's up?  You're next on WNAW.  Oh, my God.  You guys are hysterical.  Hey, listen, you know when you guys were younger and you had a fight just before school or after  school and you had the butterflies?  Yeah.  I'm feeling that for you right now.  If it wasn't like assault laws and stuff like that, I'd say you guys were dead.  You know, this is no bit, by the way.  We really don't know what's going to happen Thursday. 
[03:07:30]  I swear, man.  Because we could have passed on it, but I'm like, you know what?  After all the bravery we showed after the Rock left the studio, you know, we have to face  them one more time.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  It's a location, I think.  But I'm just really nervous for you guys.  All right, man.  I really am.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Bye.  I think we are going to get the Rock.  Remember, we were like pissed that it was Dwayne Johnson that we got?  Yeah.  I think we're not going to like it much, but we are definitely going to get the Rock. 
[03:08:00]  The Rock.  Oh.  The Rock's a-pussy.  One guy is writing on the SF Feedback, Brian from Jersey.  Can you guys do one more Tom Brokenjaw bit before the Rock kills you?  Yeah, right.  They're funny as hell.  Opie and Anthony, two DJs from Long Island, here in New York City, dead. 
[03:08:30]  Killed by wrestler Dwayne Johnson, better known as The Lock.  Tom Brokenjaw, NBC Nightly News.  These two, people thought it was a bit, some kind of a wacky Andy Kaufman type wrestling gag.  But no, it all came apart when The Rock beat them with each other.  He actually picked them up and started banging their heads together until they hemorrhaged all over the place. 
[03:09:00]  Opened that thing again, dead.  It was Thursday, but killed by the Rock.  How are you?  Hello.  Tom, Tom.  Yeah, yeah?  Why are you so groggy today?  Well, I was talking to the Rock about this story, and he delivered the fugled elbow to my head, and I'm still quite...  How many years have you been in New York City?  All right, thank you, Tom. 
[03:09:30]  And I'm still practicing, I'm staying aware of Millennium.  Millennium.  You're almost there.  Because I'll have to say it next year when the actual change in the Millennium happens.  You know, it still isn't the change of the Millennium.  Until next year.  I just wonder next year how drunk Katie Couric is going to be down in Times Square when the actual Millennium rolls in.  Will she be sauced laying on Times Square?  There you go.  Tom Broken...  All right, thank you. 
[03:10:00]  Mike, what's up?  What's up, dude?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Good.  Just wanted to say hi before you guys are dead on Thursday.  You guys better fax in and write in as much info as possible so we can be well prepared for Thursday's show.  I'm not a religious guy, you know, but I'm going to say a lot of prayers for you guys.  All right, thank you.  Please, thank you.  I don't really watch wrestling too much, but I've seen that guy rock, and I'll tell you what...  We're screwed.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys really did it this time.  Thank you, Mike.  I wonder what the hell happened. 
[03:10:30]  How did we get off on the wrong foot?  It's all that goddamn sick boy's fault.  Will!  Get him in here.  We'll throw him at him.  We've got to throw someone to the wolves.  We'll sacrifice him.  Will, what's up?  What's up?  I'm calling.  You know, you know, when I'm first...  Damn it.  You hear me?  Your phone's crapping out, Will.  He wants to say, yo, you white boys, I like you.  Yeah, because you guys...  I used to work, right?  And I got this white...  Hey, Will. 
[03:11:00]  Will, Will, Will.  Call back.  Your phone sucks.  All right.  Oh, now it works.  What do you want to say real fast?  All right, real fast.  I got this white guy, all right?  Nah, it's not working.  Will calls back.  Sorry about that.  All right, and we've got to take a break.  We have a very busy show this week.  The Rock, of course, coming in Thursday.  Stephen Lynch coming in tomorrow at 5.  Yeah.  That should be a lot of fun as well.  Sure.  And as we go to commercial, one of my favorite Stephen Lynch songs that we don't really play  that often.  Which one? 
[03:11:30]  Well, check it out.  You know, seeing these beautiful women here reminds me of the very first love of my life.  Okay.  My mother.  Not your mother.  All right, I'm going to sing about her.  I lie next to her in the bed 
[03:12:00]  She's the kind of girl I like to wear  Never mind the fact that she's dead  It turns me on  It turns me on  Sure  She's a little cold to the touch  That doesn't bother me much  Because the embalmer did such a lovely job 
[03:12:30]  A lovely job  She's a month dead and she's starting to smell  But if loving a corpse is a sin  I'll see you in hell  And now I've got her propped up in a chair 
[03:13:00]  She's losing her skin and her hair  And I'm wishing that she wouldn't stare  So much at me  So much at me  Yeah  Rigor mortis is taking its toll  And her body is as stiff as a pole  But I'll never put her back in a hole 
[03:13:30]  I dug her from  I dug her from  She's a month dead and she's starting to smell  But if loving a corpse is a sin  I'll see you in hell  I love you 
[03:14:00]  Steven Lynch everyone  He can't seem to stay out of the way  We've got Channel 2 News on  Got a megaphone and something to say  There's Mark  There's Mark  Causing trouble  On CBS 2  With the hugest wow sign  Masha Kramer  Is a tight ass crew  This is like you know I can see baby  Tycho Ma  He's a freak  There he is  That's a huge wow sign  Move over 
[03:14:30]  What happened Mark?  You look like a stardom  You've got this  You can't be doing that  What the hell are you boys doing? You're interrupting our own news broadcast, for God's sake. 
[03:15:00]  You know we're going to get in trouble by the company again.  Yeah, I know.  Take your mind.  Chance, whip them out. Whip them out.  Whip them out. Whip them out.  Whip them out. Whip them out. Whip them out.  Marsha Perry, she's so mad at me.  You tell her go to our boss.  No, I'm not. I'm just, I'm hanging out.  If you could be allowed to do your job, I could be allowed to do Mark.  I almost pissed in my pants. 
[03:15:30]  That was the funniest thing I've seen in a very, very long time.  Uh, Mark, I got one question for you.  Yeah.  How do you walk around with that jet you got?  What do you like, walk around like John Wayne? Wayne-like?  Yeah, I just want to know, guys, when is the farewell show going to be?  That's why you're going to listen every day. This could be it right here today. You never know.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W, it's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:16:00]  We broke out something from the Opie and Anthony archives to finish today's show.  Yes.  In honor of Martin Luther King Day, Anthony.  It's the MLK.  We figured it's worth one last play.  Yeah.  It's our discussion about Harlem, Anthony.  Harlem and driving around up there and just being up in Harlem.  Correct. So, uh, as we end this, uh, MLK Day.  We'll leave you this MLK Day.  Right.  The sounds of Harlem.  The sounds of Harlem. 
[03:16:30]  And we'll see you guys tomorrow at 2, okay?  Absolutely.  I believe it starts with, uh, Malcolm X Boulevard.  Enjoy and thanks for listening.  Malcolm X Boulevard.  Stay away, Whitey.  Stay away, Whitey.  Crapper alert. Crapper alert.  No cracker zone.  It is a cracker-free afternoon on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem this Saturday.  When was the last time you were up there?  Who are you kidding?  Who, me? 
[03:17:00]  It's been a cracker-free zone for many years.  I was just up there, um, let's see, when was I up in Harlem?  Yeah, Rick makes a good point.  Friday.  Friday, on my way up to Massachusetts.  You were in?  Because I had to cut through Harlem.  Oh.  How many red lights did you go through?  I don't pay attention to traffic signals up there.  Oh, no.  I don't pay attention to roads.  Yeah.  I will drive on the sidewalk.  Well, you can't.  I mean, I'm going up on the sidewalk at one point.  There's some woman who's like, whoa, my baby, look out for my stroller.  Crazy as hoggy as cracker.  And it's like, whoa, look out.  You can't even tell where the roads are in that. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, my God.  I had, like, the whole front of my grill was a Colt 45 labels from when I was just going  through garbage pails and stuff.  Why?  Why?  Rick makes a good point about the Million Youth March.  It's going to start at 11 a.m. and it's going to be done at 11.01.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  As soon as Khalid Muhammad opens his damn mouth.  And we must kill the light.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. 
[03:18:00]  All right.  Everybody disperse.  What did he say last year?  He said, grab the cops' guns and use them against them.  How is this guy getting another permit?  Right.  If somebody can say that, and then you wonder why cops shoot.  This guy was telling people if the cops come in to break up the controlled riot, I guess,  I don't know what the hell.  To grab their guns and use them against the cops.  Yeah.  What the?  How do you say that, and then the next year you're granted another permit? 
[03:18:30]  Freedom of speech, Anthony.  Unbelievable.  Hallelujah.  Freedom of speech.  And Khalid's like, yeah.  My brothers, yeah, rise up, rise up, grab the gun.  Ooh, the cops are here.  Let me run out the back.  Right.  Where I won't be seen for months.  The guy disappeared.  Oh, man.  Reverend Al staying away, too?  Yeah.  He makes all the black leaders of the 60s and 70s really proud.  Doesn't he?  Oh, my God.  Khalid Muhammad.  Khalid Muhammad. 
[03:19:00]  I don't know.  He won't.  Guess where I won't be Saturday.  Come on.  Malcolm X Boulevard.  Yes, Malcolm X Boulevard.  All right, Vanjie.  We love Vanjie.  Oh, wait.  I didn't go to Vanjie.  Hold on.  Vanjie, who lives in Harlem, on the line.  Vanjie, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  How are you doing?  All right.  We haven't talked to each other in a long time.  Uh-oh.  You sound upset, Vanjie.  No, like, first of all, why are you talking about, like, we got country roads up here? 
[03:19:30]  What, where did you go through?  No, it's not country roads.  I think you missed a point.  No.  Wait, wait, no, I'll be completely honest with you.  When, when, uh, um, a white person like myself, I'll speak for myself.  Go ahead, Opie.  When I'm driving through Harlem, I am scared S-less.  Why?  So, so, so what I do, and, and, and Anthony does it too, we drive through red lights and  get the hell out.  Well, what do you do?  Because I don't understand, because I don't understand it. 
[03:20:00]  You know what?  There's part of the, let me, let me, let me fill, let me fill you in.  There's part of the, um, you know that, that white conspiracy?  What white conspiracy?  Well, there's a white conspiracy against black people, remember?  Oh, yeah.  See, part of it is, we can run through red lights in black neighborhoods, and we just  wink at the cops, and they let us off the hook.  Oh, I see.  I'm sorry I had to fill you in on that one.  Oh, I didn't hear that one.  But that's part of the white conspiracy.  Oh.  But what streets are you going through that you're so terrified?  You know, when I'm going, like, uh, you know, back up to Boston and visiting stuff, 
[03:20:30]  I just can never find that damn FDR, man.  I swear to God.  All of a sudden, I'm, like, on first ab or something, I'm like, oh, there's got to be  an exit for the FDR around here somewhere.  Oh, no, I'm in the hundreds.  Oh, no.  Listen, guys.  Oh, my God, that's 138th Street.  How'd I get up here?  Right.  Hey, this don't look like Midtown anymore.  Where are the people in the business suits?  Right.  But listen, there's a paranoia that goes through your head. 
[03:21:00]  I'm just being honest with you, Angie.  I really don't know why, because you go from east to west on 125th Street.  It's all stores.  You've got Starbucks, Pathmark, and all that stuff.  And it's nice, so I don't know why you should be terrified.  I don't see the stores, because the hour I drive past, all those big grates are down in  front of the windows and stuff, you know, because they pull down the big locked grates.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  I swear, I was driving through there Friday. 
[03:21:30]  It looked like a scene out of my video game Kingpin that I was playing.  Like, it just looked frightening.  You guys exaggerate.  Angie, but we're just being honest.  I swear, there's not much of a bit here.  This is what we do.  The funniest line is Anthony going, oh, my, that's 120th Street.  Oh, now I'm up in the hundreds.  What happened?  Right.  Where's the bridge, for God's sake?  Right.  I've got to cross a bridge to safety.  Well, listen.  I need safety. 
[03:22:00]  Next time, if you come up here, I'll escort you through.  Will you?  And you can walk through, and nobody will bother.  I would like to try that.  But I'm telling you, I'm paranoid.  I mean, there's white people that live up here.  All my upbringing, I don't care.  What's that?  There's white people that live up here.  Oh, no, there's not.  Yes, sir.  Oh, you stopped spreading that word.  Oh, come on.  For real.  You know that.  Yeah, they're called pimps.  No.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  You're crossing the line.  Isn't that terrible?  Oh, that was just a joke.  No.  Well, you know something? 
[03:22:30]  I don't know much about Harlem, because any time I've been up there, it's been at night  when I'm driving to get to a bridge, and I don't really stop and look around.  Believe me.  And I don't make any eye contact.  And I leave about five car lengths in front of me just in case I've got to make one of them  quick getaway, just in case someone, you know, get out the core, you know?  No, but it's not that bad.  Get out the core.  Well, there's a difference, though, because, I don't know, right?  I don't know. 
[03:23:00]  It's bad.  No.  In my mind, it's bad.  And I've still got my stupid mask plates on, so it's just like, oh, brother, here it is.  Hey, I'm a mark.  Hi.  Hi, brother.  Yeah, no, I'm just down from Worcester, Massachusetts.  I need directions to the...  What's that?  Is that a firearm?  Listen, but we're so uncivilized, we've never seen the whiteboard.  Hey, look, I'm raising the roof.  I'm like you, homie.  Can't we all just get a...  Put the knife away.  Could you put...  Please put it away. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, man.  All right.  Oh, stop.  It's all stereotype.  We're just having fun, Vanjie.  I know, like yesterday, but with the Polish people today, it's equal opportunity.  No, well, hey, well, no, let's look.  We did rag the Mexicans earlier in the hour.  Oh, that's right, with the peppers and the men.  And the Hasidic Jews, there were a couple jokes that came in for those folks, too.  Oh, okay.  So, no.  Okay, because I was wondering when we were going to get our chat.  Take us up to Harlem one day and give us the tour.  I want to see the Apollo Theater.  I want to see...  Did I say the Apollo Theater? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Well, what else is up there?  If you're going to take us for, like, a drive in your neighborhood, do you mind if we did  it in an armored tank?  Oh, ladies and gentlemen, we're now on Malcolm X Boulevard.  If you look to the right, you'll see a...  Oh, look at that.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you wait for your seat to find your Kevlar, put on your vest and  your helmet, this is for your safety.  As we drive down Malcolm X Boulevard, you may hear whizzing next to your ears, which you 
[03:24:30]  might think is a mosquito or a fly.  These are actually small arms tire that are going right past your head.  Do the tour buses really go up there?  No.  Yes, they really do.  Every day.  Okay.  And, of course, we'll be disembarking from the bus to go on the attraction ride here.  It's a roller coaster, we call Crack Whore Mountain.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you look to your right, there's Huggy Bear's Wild Ride.  We'll be leaving the bus and going into an authentic 70s-style tentmobile. 
[03:25:00]  Big Cadillac, you'll all get a complimentary hat with a big booster feather on it.  Thank you for taking Harlem Tour Lines, where our motto is, it's right.  Know what I'm saying?  Mike, what's going on?  How are you doing?  All right.  No, I just wanted to tell you guys, like, I'm a cop and I go home at night at midnight,  and I'm scared.  I got a gun on me.  I blow the lights through.  There's a gun anymore in the red light. 
[03:25:30]  You blow all the lights?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you cops got to be pretty cool with that.  Like, if you see some guy blowing lights in a bad neighborhood and you pull him over or  something, it's got to be like, hey, you know, officer, come on, look around.  Yeah.  Yeah, help me out a little bit here.  You know where he's coming from.  Come on.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Well, you know, it is a small percentage of people, but I think the image that some of  these towns have, a little scary.  Let's hear from Starks.  Starks.  Yo, what's up? 
[03:26:00]  You're from Harlem?  What's that?  Yeah.  Listen, y'all killing me over here, man.  I understand.  I'm out of Starks.  We're just being honest, though.  We get a little nervous when we drive through Harlem.  What do you want from us?  Yo, I work in the projects, man.  Nothing but nice people in Harlem.  You dig?  Yeah.  All right.  Nothing but nice people, man.  Well, help us out.  We'll listen to your side of it.  Has it changed?  I don't know.  I just, I just.  Harlem.  You have a big, you gotta try to drive it through Harlem, all right?  It's like, it's a different scene now.  It's not like back in the days you hear stories. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Maybe that was true.  I don't know, but right now.  Maybe it's changed like Times Square's changed, you know?  There's no more Scott and everything.  It's like Disney.  Maybe Harlem's like Disney.  Do you have a Disney store in the middle of Harlem?  Disney.  Not really.  Well, we got Magic Johnson open up everything over there.  Oh, Magic Johnson with his movie theaters, right?  Right.  Nah.  Off mark.  I hear they have bulletproof screens at the movie theaters.  Yeah, you're killing me.  We got to bust a few caps into the movie.  Hey, Starks.  Yeah?  How far do you have to go to get to a Popeye's fried chicken? 
[03:27:00]  There's one up there somewhere.  Yeah, there is.  Yeah.  Well, what, what.  Popeye's, Kentucky, what do you want?  Well, Starks, what can you tell Whitey about Harlem?  That we don't know.  That we don't know.  Listen, y'all got more respect than a regular brother up there.  Yeah.  Trust me, they ain't trying to make the neighborhood, uh, gotta get a bad, uh, a bad rap, you know?  Yeah.  Well, check it out.  I work with white boys all the time in Harlem.  They cool.  They gay.  So we should just come up, visit and stuff?  Why not?  Check it out.  Bring plenty of cash?  You think we could do a live broadcast from the middle of Harlem? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, come to Starbucks.  Starbucks.  You guys will walk by laughing at us.  Look at the white boys in Starbucks.  Yeah, right?  White boys, well, I don't know why they put a Starbucks in Harlem.  I don't think they're the foot.  We have to be educated.  You know?  We're ignorant.  We are ignorant.  We gotta get up there and then take a look around, because I'm just going off of what  I heard and what I see when I'm driving through very late at night, and it's very scary.  Right.  Yeah, what's the deal with that cop?  He's scared.  He is.  He says he's scared. 
[03:28:00]  When he drives home, he has a gun.  He goes for the red lights, too.  Yeah, he's full of s**t.  Tell him to go in 150 to get some head.  Starks, you got some chops to you, man.  Hey.  We want to hang with you.  You call back any time.  All right, no problem, dude.  You're funny, though, man.  Yeah.  And you guys suck.  All right.  Thanks, Starks.  All right.  Bye.  Starks trying to give us the other side of it.  See, we obviously, Opie, we don't know anything about Harlem. 
[03:28:30]  No, that's right.  We don't spend time up there.  How can we make any kind of a s**t?  That's what we're pretty much proving here.  Rosa, very pissed off at us.  Rosa.  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  Well, I mean, I'm black.  I'm from Harlem.  What's the deal?  And you're listening to our show?  Yeah.  Man, I think that's awesome.  Somebody got to listen to it.  So help us out.  We don't understand Harlem is what we're pretty much saying here today.  Why is it that you don't understand Harlem?  The people up there, they just feel skin as dark.  We're naive white boys.  We don't know about up there. 
[03:29:00]  What is it that you don't know?  What do you want to know?  I don't know.  We get the image like a lot of people have that it's very scary.  And if you go up there, something bad will happen to you.  Well, I was born and raised up there.  And there's nothing going on up there.  People trying to survive.  What do you think?  But you're black.  So, and you're white.  And you're point.  So if we go up there, it's like, are we going to be looked at as victims?  Oh, please.  I'm going to look at you like a victim while you're walking up there with guns and stuff?  No.  You know, I don't know.  If I'm walking around and... 
[03:29:30]  We just want to find the FDR, that's all.  You don't know what the FDR is?  No.  Honest to God, all of a sudden I'm in the hundreds and I'm getting really scared and I don't see a big sign for the FDR.  Well, I mean, I can't see why y'all have a problem.  I mean, I know people live there who are white and live in Harlem.  Well, you're shining some light on the situation today.  We've got to go up there.  Well, you've just got to be open-minded and stop listening to the same old crap all the time.  All right, Rosa.  All right, guys.  Y'all be cool.  We're going to try to understand it.  That's all.  That's why we brought it up on the show today.  Yeah, we've got to get up there, man.  All right.  Yeah, you do.  You've got to, like, do a broadcast from up there. 
[03:30:00]  All right.  We'll do that.  All right.  All right, Rosa.  Bye.  Bye, Rosa.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's happening?  Hey.  I can tell you guys.  I've been up here 14 years.  Yeah?  They love the white boys.  The girls down there, they know one thing.  Benefits.  You know?  They love you as for that.  And the brothers down there, they stay clear.  They don't know if you're 5-0 or not.  I'm really.  You can walk the streets, bro.  Yeah?  In and out of the buildings.  They don't do a thing to you. 
[03:30:30]  You know, in stocks, man, stocks, you're cool, bro, but you're lying.  There ain't nobody working in the projects.  All right?  They use the same garbage on the back of the truck and ride around and around and around.  All right.  Oh, man.  See, this is the kind of stuff we hear, so we don't know what the real deal is.  It's all right, though.  I have no problem going up there.  I'll go up there.  We'll work something out.  Ain't nobody going to bother you up there.  We're going to bring, like, a DAT recorder, and we're going to record our day in Harlem.  That's it, man. 
[03:31:00]  You want to be like the Blair Witch Project?  I'll find the tape years later.  Ain't nobody going to come down there.  All right, man.  Josh!  All right, Josh.  All right, thank you.  Oh!  Oh!  Wow, that's funny, man.  It's a pile of crack pipes outside our tent.  What does it mean?  I'm sorry I came up here. 
[03:31:30]  I'm sorry.  What is that?  Oh!  Oh, my God.  What's that sound?  Oh, my God!  Josh!  Josh!  Oh, man. 
[03:32:00]  I can't breathe.  What a mess.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, stupid.  Wow.  Boo, boo, boo.  Or stupidity on the way.  One, two, seven, four. 
[03:32:30]  WNEW.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.  One, two, seven, four.
