<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of John Popper's arrest for possessing weapons, drugs, and paraphernalia, sparking a debate about whether Blues Traveler is a one-hit wonder band.  This led to a broader discussion of musicians and their perceived "one-hit wonder" status, fueled by listener calls.

Next, a significant portion focused on a caller, Tim, seeking advice on a planned threesome, prompting crude and humorous commentary from the hosts and guest Patrice O'Neal, who also shared personal anecdotes about relationships and sex.  This was followed by a discussion about gastric bypass surgery and its effects, using Star Jones as an example, transitioning into a broader conversation about weight loss and body image.  The show then shifted to *American Idol*, specifically discussing Antonella Barbera's dismissal and Sanjaya Malakar's unexpected popularity, analyzing voting patterns and demographics.  The show concluded this section with their "story of the month" segment: the arrest of a middle school principal found in his office with drugs, a naked woman, and gay pornography.  Jimmy Norton's Pittsburgh comedy show was also mentioned.

A later segment opened with a discussion of the same principal's arrest, expanding into a conversation about homosexuality, aging gay men, and the hosts' often derogatory comments about gay men and their sexual practices.  Opie and Anthony also discussed their views on love and relationships, contrasting Opie's recent romantic involvement with Anthony's approach.  A caller, "Big Steve," criticized their homophobic language.  The conversation then briefly touched on a British woman using cannabis in cooking, pictures of Antonella Barbara, and a brief listener call before shifting to a conflict with Andrew Dice Clay.  They played a clip of a phone call where Dice Clay avoided confronting them, and discussed their past relationship, including a Madison Square Garden show and the subsequent fallout.  The segment concluded with promotional announcements and a mention of a MacBook karaoke contest.

Another segment focused on a "Wii for a Wii" contest, referencing a previous fatal contest and emphasizing their commitment to safety, despite acknowledging the inherent risk.  They discussed logistics and the need for female participants, with a caller expressing safety concerns.  This segment also included a comparison between their show and the seemingly popular but bland "Eric and Kathy" show in Chicago.  They played clips of "Eric and Kathy," highlighting their perceived inoffensive and repetitive nature and contrasting it with their edgier style.  Patrice O’Neal was a guest in this segment, and they manipulated "Eric and Kathy’s" audio for comedic effect. Numerous callers also participated in the discussion surrounding the contest. The segment concluded by mocking FCC complaints about the Super Bowl halftime show and commercials, focusing on the complainants' perceived biases (largely attributed to white people) and misunderstandings of FCC regulations.  A lengthy discussion with Patrice O’Neal about his relationship and reluctance to commit, despite giving his girlfriend a diamond ring, concluded this part.

A subsequent segment heavily featured a discussion about daytime strippers, prompted by a news story about teenage strippers robbing a bank.  The hosts and callers shared graphic descriptions of their experiences with daytime strip clubs and the strippers' appearances. They also discussed the parents of the teenage robbers appearing on television.  A significant portion involved a game where they guessed country song subjects from their titles, leading to crude and sexually suggestive interpretations.  The segment ended with announcements about upcoming events, including a video contest and Patrice O’Neill's appearance.

The final segment began with a crude anecdote about a father's influence on his child's behavior.  The conversation shifted to critiquing country music lyrics, frequently using offensive racial slurs and homophobic terms. They announced winners for a HotMovies.com video contest: "CSI Opie & Anthony" (3rd), "Boardroom Jimmy" (2nd), and "Portrait of an O&A Pest" (1st), detailing the explicit content of the winning entries.  The segment also featured reactions to an internet video of a girl mispronouncing words, further use of racial slurs and stereotypes, a listener question about vacation destinations, a call from a Cape Cod prison worker, and further discussion of the internet video, perceived hypocrisy, and the "Line of the Day" winner sponsored by Bodog.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  XM202.  Oh, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  No!  Oh, God!  No!  Opie.  I'm scum because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton.  Look at his face.  How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Vagel.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Do you hear that?  You know what that means.  Something exciting is about to happen.  Right.  I'll just sit here and wait for it. 
[00:01:00]  Race war!  Race war!  No.  Race war!  Well, that's what John Popper was thinking, I guess.  Race war!  We'll get into Mr. John Popper a little later on.  He was ready for the race war.  My God.  Who knew he was such a kook?  Actually, who knew he was such a man after my own heart?  Who knew you had so much in common with Matt Johnny? 
[00:01:30]  With John Popper.  John Popper.  Well, I guess we should start with that.  By the way, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Of course.  The Friday edition.  John Popper, lead singer of the Blues Traveler.  The Blues Traveler?  How about Blues Traveler?  Blues Traveler.  But they pulled him over.  His buddy was speeding.  I don't think he was driving the car, right?  I'm not sure of that part of the story.  He wasn't?  Yeah.  His buddy was driving, speeding.  They pull him over. 
[00:02:00]  They smell the old marijuana.  Ah, it gives him the right to start poking around.  I guess it was John Popper's car.  They do a little search, and they found some arsenal.  Yeah.  Do we have the list of things they found in John Popper's car?  You don't need a written list.  Just open up your Splinter Cell game and look through the weapons that you use in Splinter Cell.  And he had all those.  Just about every single one of them.  The sniper rifle, the grenade launcher, the automatic shotgun. 
[00:02:30]  He had the night vision goggles.  Just about everything you use in Splinter Cell.  He really had night vision goggles?  Yeah.  I think he had one of those winch pulleys that could pull you up to the building where you could  then stand between the two buildings in the alleyway and jump down on the guy and snap his neck.  Yeah.  Love that game.  John Popper arrested after cops find weapons, cachet, drugs in his SUV.  I guess the car was clocked going 111 miles per hour in Washington State.  Inside the black Mercedes SUV, officers found a cachet of weapons and a small amount of marijuana. 
[00:03:00]  A police dog searched the vehicle, finding numerous hidden compartments containing four rifles, nine handguns, switchblade knife, and other things.  They also found a taser and night vision goggles.  The vehicle was seized.  Wow, he had some hidden compartments in there for that, huh?  And I guess he was saying he didn't want to be left behind if there was a national disaster or something.  Race war! 
[00:03:30]  Or a race war.  He basically said, look, if there's a natural disaster, I don't want to be left behind so I have all these weapons to what?  To defend myself and get food?  Yeah, you don't want to have to go home and grab them up.  Right.  So whatever happens, you're ready, there you are.  When did John Popper go nuts?  Is that really nuts?  He's nuts.  Or is that, you know, just kind of living in this environment in this day and age?  You must be prepared, and being prepared is a little different in this day and age than it was. 
[00:04:00]  Is it any different than people digging bomb shelters in their backyards during the Cold War,  thinking they were going to, you know, go down there and survive the nuclear attack?  Nobody who wasn't a one-hit wonder would ever have that many guns in his truck.  See, Patrice just added the one-hit wonder because the 20 minutes leading up to the live broadcast,  we've been arguing Blues Traveler and their status as a one-hit wonder band.  I think they're a two-hit wonder.  I mean, look, you never caught Paul McCartney with guns in his car. 
[00:04:30]  That's true.  Because people, when they're successful, they have other people around them that will do things for them.  That have the guns.  No one who actually, like there's some exceptions to the rule like you, who just have fun having bullets in his hand.  Love it.  It makes you feel, you know, I've seen a couple of pictures of you with those rifles, and they're just bigger than you.  Oh, they're good.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  By the way, are you laughing at his arsenal today?  Actually, I would like to, but no, I'm more jealous than laughing.  You're pretty impressed by what John Popper had in his vehicle? 
[00:05:00]  He's got a little bit of everything you need.  By the way, I don't have a good sniper rifle yet.  By the way, he's not a one-hit wonder because he wouldn't have been able to afford all this if he was a one-hit wonder.  No, one-hit wonder.  One song, you can't afford all this stuff.  Don't you think the Come On Eileen guy is going to afford all those guns after that song?  There you go.  That's the one we were trying to think of.  We're like, give us these midnight runners.  You don't think he can afford a bunch of guns?  Sure, he probably does.  Probably got them.  He used to wear the bulletproof, the bullet, the gun holster for no reason. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  What is a harmonica in there?  Shoulder holster with a harmonica in it.  Oh, man, you can see he's a big kook.  But Blue Traveler was not a one-hit wonder.  They were.  They had a vibe.  They had a band.  They had a huge following.  They just didn't have the radio hits.  Do you hear yourself?  Come On Eileen was a one-hit wonder.  No, Dexy's midnight runners were big in Birmingham, England.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  And in Floofgard, Germany.  They are big time, baby.  But here's the difference.  You wouldn't run out to see Dexy's midnight runners in concert. 
[00:06:00]  You wouldn't, but you would run out and see Blue Traveler.  Let me not act like I don't know what you're talking about, okay?  But let me say this.  Technically, they had one hit and maybe two hits.  Thank you very much.  They had Run Around and Hook, by the way.  They had two hits.  And it's not semantics is what I'm talking about.  I'm really there with one hit one, and I'm going to tell you why.  Because I know the one hit.  Now, it doesn't count.  If I say Mobb Deep as a rap group.  Right.  It's like, oh, man, Mobb Deep's crazy.  But you know LL Cool J.  You might know one Mobb Deep song, but I know Mobb Deep as a whole group for years putting stuff out. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  You might know one song.  Hold on.  You got to help us out.  So one hit wonder in the rap community?  Mobb Deep?  No, I'm saying to you.  Meaning.  I have no clue.  So you got to help me out here.  I'm trying to think of somebody that might have been a one hit, that you might have heard a one song, but they are way more important than one song.  Right, right.  But you might have heard it.  So that's what my argument is, is not that they're not a great band. 
[00:07:00]  It's that I heard of that one song that they did and made them very famous.  Now, they may have been popular before and popular after.  It's like, but that song made them famous to me, and they haven't did anything else that I ever heard of.  They're a one hit wonder.  To me, Diddy is a one hit wonder.  No, it's a couple of people.  As in pee?  Yeah.  What the hell else?  After that stupid Sting song, I can't name one thing he's done.  Fair enough.  But he's famous for other things. 
[00:07:30]  He's famous for throwing parties.  He's like Paris Hilton.  I was just going to say, Paris Hilton for throwing parties.  So the Grateful Dead one hit wonder, they only had one real hit.  I understand the Deadhead.  As far as the charts go and all that.  But yes.  Yeah, but the Blues Traveler had that same vibe.  One hit wonder.  Grateful Dead one hit wonder.  One hit wonder.  No, the definition of a one hit wonder is, come on.  It's Dexy Midnight Runners.  It's Kajagoogoo.  It's too shy.  You're not being fair, though, man.  You're not being fair to a one hit wonder situation.  And a band like Blues Traveler, I don't think they went out there hoping for a lot of radio hits. 
[00:08:00]  They were just a good, solid band with a following.  They sold a lot of concert tickets back in the day.  Does he understand?  I agree with him.  99% except for.  I'm saying the system is flawed.  You're a fan.  They have that.  Because my thing is, I said, how come they're not considered a one hit wonder?  It's because of the way they were.  You could tell they weren't a commercial type of band.  Right.  They enjoyed their thing.  But I'm saying, I didn't know about them.  You might be. 
[00:08:30]  You might be.  I mean, Hootie and the Blowfish might be a great band when you go.  Man, I remember Hootie back in the day when they used to.  Man, they were great.  And then they did whatever they did to become Hootie.  Now you don't see them no more.  But they still could be good.  I'm saying John Popper and them were one hit wonders because I heard of them during that hit.  And I haven't heard of them since.  I'm not a fan of them.  So I'm sure there's a Dexy's Midnight Runner.  I'm sure there's a Dexy's Midnight Runner fan somewhere.  Knows every song they've ever done. 
[00:09:00]  All of them.  No.  Yeah, you find one today.  We're talking to a lot of people.  You find one that has the concert t-shirts and Dexy.  It's going to wait out all night.  Y'all didn't hit an album, Funky Dexy's.  You don't know that one.  It's 72.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait till you hear that.  Let's go to Matt in Jersey.  Matt, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Good morning.  Good morning.  I'm a huge, well, used to be a huge Blue Sala fan until we had the gastric  blood test surgery.  He looks like Fat Bastard from the Austin Powers movies now. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, well, he's creepy looking.  Some people, they can get that stomach thing done and they look all right.  Others, man, they look like they're melting.  Like Star Jones looks like she's melting.  And other people like Al Roker.  Like our own Steve.  Al Roker pulled it off for the most part.  Our own Steve pulled it off for the most part.  He looks good.  But Star Jones, she was in the news yesterday because she's going back to Court TV.  She looks like she's melting.  She's someone that needs to be big.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  She can't.  Some people just need to be big.  Oh, I have the skin chopped off.  Yeah, chop it off or something.  Can you imagine our own Patrice here getting the stomach stapling?  You just look good as a bigger guy.  Yeah, but it ain't.  You carry yourself well.  I don't know.  And I just want to lose it naturally because that skin is worse than any fatness.  Mm-hmm.  Like a bat.  You just have bat wings.  Oh, just nasty.  She is awful looking.  She is ridiculous.  Who knows, though?  What would you?  You'd probably look like Denzel or something.  Can you imagine?  You lose it. 
[00:10:30]  You lose all the weight.  And all of a sudden it's like, is that Patrice?  I wouldn't even know what to do.  My girl wouldn't want me to stay fat.  If I ever got sexy, it'll be a big problem.  It's like you could be because you don't know.  Sometimes you don't know.  You see like big girls and they lose a lot of weight and you go, oh, she kind of looked  better with the fatter face and stuff.  And sometimes they lose and you go, oh, my God, there was a babe under there.  You know?  So who knows?  Like Patrice, you're a big guy.  But then you lose the weight.  You could be like, you know, some smooth Billy Dee Williams son of a bitch.  I don't know.  I got big face features. 
[00:11:00]  I think you're meant for this.  If I keep, because your nose is gristled, that ain't going to lose weight.  I don't want to.  You can't exercise away gristle.  I don't mean to laugh, but you do have big face features.  I have big face features, man.  I'm looking at your eyebrows alone would take up half my face.  The one eyebrow would take up.  Like, that's the problem that Star Jones has.  Yeah.  Because she has a big head.  She has huge eyes.  Giant, like those bloodhound eyes. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And a giant head.  And then her body type is all weird, too.  Like, she lost the weight, but her hips, like her legs are still as far apart as they were  when she was fat.  Her hips don't lie.  Yeah.  And there is a huge gap between the two legs.  And then what's the nasty scar where the cleavage is supposed to be?  I don't know.  If they did a gastric bypass, they did it from her throat down to her.  Like, from where the food goes in to where it comes out. 
[00:12:00]  They cut her heart out.  Her heart was fat, too.  We're going to get rid of all your organs, man.  They had to shave down her heart with a potato peeler.  We're taking all your organs.  We're going to leave you with one rib and a kidney.  That's all you need.  That's all you need.  This looks awful.  And she's got this.  Drink water all day.  This unbelievable scar.  Okay, man.  Hey, everyone's pissed off about the blues.  Wait a minute.  Before you talk to them, Opie. 
[00:12:30]  Can they.  Wait.  Let me add this to the discussion.  Four.  A blues traveler album, okay?  Okay.  Sold four million copies.  Sexy Midnight Runners there didn't sell four million freaking albums.  Do me a, just, can, before people start going, just, can you understand what I'm saying?  I'm not disrespecting John, but I'm saying, I never heard of him, and I've never heard  of him since.  I've heard of him during that hit.  Right.  And that's why I call him a one-hit wonder. 
[00:13:00]  I think there's a disappointment.  Yeah, they did have two hits officially, Run Around and Hook, but I think a lot of people  out there were disappointed because they really thought this band was going to just have a  ton of stuff that would make the radio because they had a unique sound and they were a pretty  cool band.  Yeah.  And they fell short of expectations.  Matt, what do you want to add?  No, I don't know.  They had two hits on the radio, so that's not a one-hit wonder.  All right.  Technically.  Technically.  All right, let's talk to the black community here. 
[00:13:30]  Sonny in Florida.  Sonny.  Yo, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, I'm going to call Patrice out here.  He's talking about one-hit wonders, and it seems as though he's separating black music  from white music.  It doesn't really make a difference.  I want to see if he knows anything from Africa and Pumbata.  Does he know anything about that?  What about Planet Rock?  You ever heard any of the songs?  Anybody else?  Yeah.  At Your Own Risk, all the songs from Beach Street. 
[00:14:00]  I forgot the name.  It's about four or five.  Yeah, I know you forgot.  No, well, yeah, but why are you upset?  I'm not defending African Pumbata.  Planet Rock is the big one, but they do have four other songs.  I grew up in Brooklyn and all the songs.  But, Mr. All You Heard Was Race, all I'm saying is,  they're a one-hit wonder.  Wait a minute.  Is Africa Pumbata a one-hit wonder to you?  Far from.  I got three.  So then what is your point, ass? 
[00:14:30]  I'm saying Africa Pumbata.  You're saying they're not.  But I'm saying that John Pumper, I'm saying that Blues Traveler is because I never heard of him.  Now, if you're a white guy and heard of Planet Rock and didn't hear of anything else,  then you can say that African Pumbata was a one-hit wonder, couldn't you?  It would be fair for you to say that, right?  Exactly.  Yeah, shut up, Mr. Had Everything to Say.  Yeah, that's right.  Just shut up.  I'm leaning on the point that you don't really know me. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, shut up.  You're just one of those guys.  Thank you, Tony.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  Shut up.  All right, listen.  At this point, we're going to have to agree to disagree.  Why don't we just agree to disagree?  Because we're getting nowhere with this.  Exactly.  They don't get what I'm saying.  He's sitting there saying African Pumbata.  He probably knows more about African Pumbata than I do.  I know about four or five songs.  He probably knows them all.  Before Breakdance, hey, in 1960, he created African Hats.  I don't care. 
[00:15:30]  It's like I'm saying I heard of Blues Traveler when they made that one song  when he played the harmonica and had on this bulletproof vest,  and then I haven't heard of him since.  Don't get mad at me.  They're in the category.  I think VH1 did it, the two-hit wonder.  Fair enough.  They had two hits.  Now he's running around.  Two hits.  Now he's running around with an arsenal.  Yeah, which is awesome.  He's the woman from Terminator now.  He's Linda Hamilton from Terminator 2 now.  He's preparing.  He's preparing.  He has a son named John Connor. 
[00:16:00]  I'm John Papa.  Cyberdyne.  I must get to Cyberdyne.  What is wrong with him?  That weed must be really good, man.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tim in Pittsburgh.  Jimmy Norton's in Pittsburgh all weekend long at the Improv.  He played last night, matter of fact.  Tim, what's up?  Tim.  Hello.  Hey, how you doing? 
[00:16:30]  What's going on?  Hello.  Yeah, what's up, Tim?  What's up?  How's it going?  All right.  We got a few minutes here.  What do you got?  Yeah, hey.  I got a problem I'm having here.  I'm trying to get my girlfriend to have a threesome with me.  I kind of think her friend's into it.  Yeah.  But in a way, I kind of think that her friend just wants to get a little bit of me behind  her back.  Wow.  Well, we have an expert on the show today.  This guy wants to get his girlfriend into a threesome situation with his girlfriend's 
[00:17:00]  friend, best friend?  Yeah.  Well, one of her best friends, yeah.  But he thinks the friend just wants a piece of him.  Yeah, but that's not the point.  It's what he wants.  Right.  How old are you, Tim?  I'm 22.  22.  Do you think you can handle the pressure of the intimacy that you're going to want to  have with this other chick?  Well, see, the thing I'm thinking about, I'm worried about, you know, once I get this,  I'm going to be all over this other girl.  Yeah, you shouldn't do it, but you're too young to think like that.  Yeah, if you're thinking that now, it's over, Johnny. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, you're too young to do it.  You might as well just say, you might as well do it and then ruin your relationship because  you're a young dude, dude.  Yeah, let's be honest.  You're 20.  I'm going to ruin my relationship.  See, I got a one-year-old.  So I'm with this.  So don't do it, then.  Oh, all right.  You got your...  And another thing, don't kiss her.  If y'all do do the threesome, do not kiss her.  That's where it gets intimate.  Do not show...  That's where...  That's going too far.  Treat her bad when you're having sex with them.  That's all I'm saying to you.  Treat her like garbage.  What do you think about just doing it behind her back?  That's a mistake.  It's like, listen, if you got a girl, and this is what I'm saying being a young dude, 
[00:18:00]  if you got a girl that's willing to let you get some side as long as the rule is she's there,  you're being greedy.  You just...  That's a nasty ego.  Oh, there's all these little jokes going on between us, you know, like talking about,  you know, oh, I told her one day, you know, hey, I wouldn't mind if you cheated on me  as long as it was with that girl Jackie, you know?  And she tells Jackie, because we're on the phone, Jackie's laughing in the background,  and I'm like, well, as long as I could be there, too.  And they're all like, oh, yeah, well, you could join in, and this and that.  They're always joking around. 
[00:18:30]  Is Jackie a slut?  What's up?  Is she a slut?  Who, Jackie?  Yeah, like you think she'll go for this?  I kind of think she is, but see, that's why, like, I know her cousin and everything, too,  and her cousin tries to tell me, like, oh, she's going to try to do you and this and that.  And she's probably going to try to do you behind more, she's back, and this and that.  And I just don't want to do in my relationship.  You know what?  Let me give you, this is the one advice you've got to have to rise above that.  You have to be better than both those girls.  You have to be thinking to yourself, they're both idiots, and whatever their plan is, 
[00:19:00]  you've got to rise above it.  So one of them girls might have a plan that they might be jealous.  Anything they want to do with you, it really has nothing to do with you.  It has something to do with them.  So this other girl may be jealous of your girlfriend and might want to pull that little,  that coveting kind of, what is it, coveting your neighbor kind of thing.  So she might be just wanting you just for her own personal ego.  Rise above both of them.  Just get your thing off, whatever the good radio word is.  Just do, be righteous. 
[00:19:30]  Get two girls.  Do you understand that even getting to the cusp of sleeping with two women makes every guy,  like, the idea of it makes people horny.  You understand what I'm saying?  You're almost there.  Some guys can't even entertain what you're having a problem figuring out what you're going to do after.  Just get some righteous duo.  What's the word I can use on the radio?  This guy is at the point right now where all he needs is to get all three of you in a room 
[00:20:00]  with a little bit of booze and the situation's done.  It'll take care of itself and take Patricia's advice, don't kiss the other one.  Yeah, don't kiss the other one.  But you can do anything else.  You can do any other nasty thing you want.  But as soon as you give her a kiss, it's over.  Don't look at her with longing eyes.  What about if my girlfriend wasn't around?  Would it be all right to kiss her then?  Look, he's greedy.  He just wants intimacy. 
[00:20:30]  Dude, you just want this other chick.  Yeah, you just want this other chick.  You just want this other chick.  You just want this other chick.  I'm really trying to get this other chick.  I've been wanting her for, like, probably about six, seven months.  You know what?  You might as well bang her and just ruin your life.  Yeah, ruin it, man.  Get it over with.  You're young.  You're young.  You're 22.  You might as well just do it.  Yeah.  Because you can't.  The only problem I got is you got the kids so that, you know, you got a connection there.  But it just sounds like you want to move on.  You don't want the threesome as much as you would just want this other chick.  Yeah.  The threesome means nothing to him.  Yeah.  That's kind of true.  In a way, I'd rather just have the other chick.  He would just leave the...  He'd leave his girl just sitting there watching. 
[00:21:00]  He'd call him out.  He wants the other girl.  Yeah, you just want the other girl.  So there's no way to save you from this.  That girl would just...  His girlfriend would just be sitting there watching.  A little horny 22-year-old boy.  That's it.  Yeah.  There you go, man.  There's nothing on the point about it.  Wait till you get 30.  He just reaches over every so often and pats his girl on the shoulder.  How you doing?  That's why I made a mistake and kissed a girl.  My girl goes, we was having a good one too.  This girl was a trooper.  I'm kissing her and my girl looks at me and kisses her.  She goes, what is this, flavor of love? 
[00:21:30]  I got that thing.  You can get some advice for me from some of the colors, right?  All right, thank you, sir.  She couldn't stand it.  I was doing all kind of creepy stuff.  Yeah.  She was just going with it.  And then all of a sudden, it was...  I was like, hey, hey, hey.  She's like, whoa, what is this kissing stuff?  You picked the wrong day to come in.  We had H-Cup Jane and her husband.  They're swingers.  Really?  We did a whole hour or so on swinging and stuff.  And then they followed us over to XM and we have these pal talk cameras, you know. 
[00:22:00]  And they did it on cam.  Yeah.  For everybody.  Oh, yeah.  Went into the office, pulled the shades.  Oh, yeah.  They had the Liberator.  So they got on top of the Liberator.  Are they sexy people?  And they got on the Liberator and they started going at it.  She's all right.  Yeah.  She had H implants.  Ridiculously big.  That must have been great.  All right, well.  But they went to town.  It was, you know, they were able to get right to it. 
[00:22:30]  By the way, you know, I'm doing black clothes tomorrow on the Saturday night.  It was Saturday, razzle-dazzle.  On XM.  The pictures of Hcup Jane are up on openingathlete.com.  You can check it out for yourself.  And they're topless.  I mean, look, there you go.  Really?  Right in the studio?  It was.  Oh, man.  How come you guys don't call?  It was crazy, actually.  At least call.  Just like speed dial me any sex stuff like that.  We were pushing close to 1,000 people in one pal talk room.  Yeah.  We were getting close to 1,000. 
[00:23:00]  Just checking out this couple having at it in our office.  You guys are, you're not really into that whole world at all, right?  No way.  That's what we discussed.  I couldn't get past the jealousy part.  No.  Uh-uh.  No way.  And your girl's hot, too.  Well, I told you at the, at the.  Yeah, you scare me a little bit.  Opie was, because I guess my girl and her, and his girl was like getting along.  And Opie's like, mm.  No.  Don't talk to his girlfriend.  Oh, Jesus.  No, this is going to end immediately.  If I whisper in the ear, honestly, sicker, sicker, get a girl. 
[00:23:30]  Get a girl.  Get a girl.  Now walk away.  No, honestly.  Get her.  Get her.  Honestly, she can handle it herself.  But I just know you.  And I'm like, oh, man.  Fast forward.  All of a sudden, I'm on a double date with Patrice and his girl.  Are you kidding me?  Opie got to go to the bathroom.  He won't go.  His bladder's on the floor because he just won't leave.  Just staring.  Go to the bathroom, dude.  What's wrong with you?  No way will that ever happen.  Don't leave her alone.  And I like you, and your girl is really nice. 
[00:24:00]  And I'm like, no.  We're nice people.  We're just pieces of garbage.  You're intimidating, though, man.  I just want a little steak dinner.  You guys are thinking way past that.  As my girl's wiping A1 off your girls.  Wait, you got a little A1.  I'm like, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Get it off of my tongue.  I'm like, come on, Craig.  Come back from the bathroom.  What the hell is going on here?  Why Patrice is not on the show anymore? 
[00:24:30]  Because we went out to dinner.  Oh, man.  I saw that.  I'm like, oh, man.  He's like, don't be talking to his girlfriend.  I've heard the story.  I love Patrice because he's so open with what he does.  But I'm like, no.  That's all you need.  And she's a predator, too.  What a trooper.  Your girlfriend would come back and go, your girlfriend's a predator?  You know, he's got a swing.  Oh, she really gets off on manipulating women.  The hunt.  Oh, once you get a girl to get into changing a girl's whole, like, really? 
[00:25:00]  So how do you deal with the jealousy?  And she goes, well.  And I go, oh.  And I just sit back.  And watch her work.  And then she brings them to me on a planet.  You're like one of those guys that if you were a serial killer, you'd get your girl to,  like, help you kill people.  We would no question, me and my girl would go down together.  Yeah.  No question.  You'd be one of those that just, like.  Watch the door.  She got a shotgun.  I'm robbing the bank.  And we out of there.  And then I'm like, the cops are chasing us. 
[00:25:30]  I'm like, baby, this is it.  All right.  Hey, we got to take a quick break.  Wow.  We got some threesomes on the line here.  We got to talk about, we weren't going to talk about American Idol, but Patrice walked  in the office and had us all just, we almost all fell down.  A whole new spin on it.  It was really, really funny.  We'll get into that as well.  And there's so much to do.  We got to figure it all out.  Stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Patrice O'Neill today.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:26:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Hey, good morning.  What's happening?  Oh, by the way, the Opie and Anthony Show, we got to add another city to the cities that  love us and that we love and that we love.  We know there's love in all the cities we're broadcasting to, but some of these cities, 
[00:26:30]  something's going on.  New York loves us lately.  Chicago loves us lately.  Speaking of which, we got to beat up Eric and Kathy one more time today.  I want to hear a little more of them today.  Before we move on, please.  We add Buffalo to the list of cities that are loving the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bless you, Buffalo.  Boston doesn't love us right now. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Are you talking about the people or just the...  The ratings weren't kind in Boston for some reason.  Just numbers.  WBCN, man?  That's been a big time thing for a long time.  Oh, yeah.  We know.  You know, we know.  We know the people.  This is more a thing that we're doing on the show.  It doesn't...  It doesn't make sense what happened in the ratings in Boston.  One month, they loved us.  The next month, 90% of one of the demos just said goodbye.  It's impossible.  People just don't care that much about anything to have a mass exodus.  Like the ratings showed in this one demo in Boston. 
[00:27:30]  It's ridiculous.  If an atomic bomb went off in Boston, then maybe you can justify the ratings going down like that.  That's about it.  You think it coincided with the whole...  Light bright.  Light bright then?  Nah.  Nah.  Because Boston knew we were right.  Nah.  Boston knew that they looked kind of silly to the rest of the country.  Yeah.  I'll talk to somebody in Boston.  Yeah.  See what's going on.  Yeah.  Talk to people.  See what the word is on the street.  Because WBCN, there's really no talk radio in Boston like that on FM. 
[00:28:00]  None.  No, not really.  Come on.  Come on.  Listen to this.  Somebody lied.  Somebody lied.  But let's just say hi to Buffalo today.  Buffalo.  And I want to say hi to Shred and Reagan because they've really, really helped us out in Buffalo.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, they used to do the mornings.  They moved them to afternoons.  They were beyond cool about it.  They basically told their listeners, look, give these guys a shot.  Because we had some old listeners that knew who we were, but then we had new listeners.  And they're giving us a shot.  It's working out well.  And then Shred and Reagan, they went to afternoons, and they're blowing up. 
[00:28:30]  So the station's doing very, very well.  So good morning to Buffalo.  Thank you.  And could you send your condolences to the Buffalo Bills?  They got rid of Willis McGahee.  Whoa.  He was a great running back for them.  So condolences to Buffalo for losing him.  Sorry about that.  Condolences.  All right.  My condolences.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  American Idol, Patrice.  What about it, man?  I thought it was kind of boring last night.  I didn't. 
[00:29:00]  We weren't even going to talk about it, but then you had a great take on...  How can you not talk about...  Well, the big news was they kicked off...  What's her face there?  Antonella Barber.  Antonella.  God, she's so delicious.  They kicked her off.  I think that was a bad move.  She sings as bad...  Let me tell you something.  She is so bad.  As bad as the people you make fun of, like they do the audition process and the people  who can't sing, she was as bad...  And last night when they sang the You Gotta Go last song, she made faces at her own self 
[00:29:30]  like, you know what?  Maybe I'd do something.  I really didn't belong here.  She bit her lip and went, ooh, God, I stink.  She's on the fast track to Playboy.  Oh, man.  She is going to get a payday.  Money offers.  Oh, look at that.  And I think she's going to go for it.  No problem.  That girl will be in Playboy before the finals.  I hope porn.  If they're smart.  See, I never root for people who go, I want to make it.  She's one of those girls, another girl that got kicked off.  They just want it. 
[00:30:00]  I don't like people who go vaguely, I want to make it.  Like, if they told her, listen, baby, I'm going to teach you how to juggle and you'll  be famous.  She'll go, okay, I'll juggle.  Like, she'll do anything to be famous, which makes her great.  But I hope somebody can get a hold of her and do a little porn.  All right, all right.  But this is what we're getting at.  Matt from Bethlehem, PA, is on to what Patrice was saying in the office today.  And he didn't hear what he had to say.  His feedback is, that hula dancing Indian chick is so hot. 
[00:30:30]  It's not even.  Let me tell you something.  I was hoping, what's his name, Sanjaya?  Sanjaya, Sanjay, whatever.  I was hoping he'd get voted off just so I could, like, get on with the healing process  of missing him.  He's the sexiest boy I've ever seen.  When he sung, stepping out with my baby, I was haunted.  Stepping out with my baby.  I was haunted by the image of that beautiful boy. 
[00:31:00]  You're sitting at home going, I know I'm not gay, but what is going on here?  Let me tell you something.  He is so much of a girl, right, that you could be a straight man and date him.  Totally straight.  And you not be gay.  And you're not gay.  Like, you go, this is my boyfriend, Sanjaya.  And they go, cool, nice to meet you, dude.  And you're still a heterosexual.  Yeah.  That's how much of a girl he is.  He was, like, I was like, please get rid of him so I don't have to feel gay watching 
[00:31:30]  his big eyes that don't blink and his little sweet hula hoop hips.  And his big sunny smile.  And his dedication to his disappointed granddad that died.  Not sure he was gay or talented.  That might have been the reason why the grandfather dropped dead.  My gay Indian son.  Oh.  He's got the girl hair.  It's, it's.  He is beyond feminine.  But it's not.  He's more feminine than a lot of the broads walking around.  It's not even flamboyant. 
[00:32:00]  Like, you know Ant?  You know the guy, the comic Ant?  Yeah.  That hosts, like, the celebrity.  Like, he's a flamboyantly gay man.  Yeah.  This kid was cursed with a member.  Like.  Right.  He was cursed with it.  He's got the male parts, but he's a girl.  He sits down and pee.  No doubt.  He sits down and pees.  He's such a girl.  It's not even a gay dude. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  He's such a prison prize.  And you just needed it.  A prison prize.  He should commit a crime.  If he loses, he should commit a crime.  Go to jail and get treated like the celebrity he always wanted to get treated like.  Oh, they would love him.  You know what kind of warrior fights they would have over that boy?  Oh, the deals that would be made.  They'd be trucking in merchandise to trade for him.  I watch it with my girl, and she's talking to me, like, watch some Giants sing, and I'm  like, come on, get off me.  Don't.  Come on, give me some space, baby. 
[00:33:00]  I got to watch this boy.  Let me enjoy this weird feeling I'm having.  He's delicious.  I wanted him voted off.  Get rid of him so I can get him off my mind.  So I can move on.  I keep looking at Shrek.  But the dot heads out there, they voted him through.  A lot of dot heads voting, I guess.  That's the case.  Because he had no business being not kicked off.  If that's the case, he can't lose.  He's got Indians and the gay community, and just gentlemen that think he's an attractive 
[00:33:30]  girl.  If a third of the Indians voted for him, a third, that's more than everybody in the United  States of America.  He can't lose.  Oh, there he is.  There he is, Patrice.  Just look at him.  And he's hoolering.  He's hoolering.  Oh, look at him.  He knows how to move those hips.  There's not even a hint of a guy in there when he's moving those hips.  He's beautiful.  No Adam's apple. 
[00:34:00]  Why did God do this to me?  I was a man's man until this year's American Idol.  Patrice walked in all disturbed.  He's sweating like, ah, they just got to vote him off.  I need the healing to start.  I need to stop the healing process.  Because he's so sweet, and he can't sing.  I'm just dreaming about him after he loses, just whispering in my ear, snapping out with  you, baby. 
[00:34:30]  Just for me.  Go out there and cook some of your traditional Indian food, sweetie.  Well, so to summarize, we lost the hot broad.  Antonella Barbera's gone, unfortunately.  And the other hot broad.  I didn't think she was hot with the kinky curly hair.  She's a hot girl.  She's definitely a hot girl.  And then the hula dancer dude is, whatever his name is, Sanjay, Sanjay.  Hula dancer.  He made it to the top 12.  When he said that, it's like, now tell us a little bit about yourself, something that 
[00:35:00]  most people wouldn't know.  And they go to him, and he's in front of this rose bush, and he's just going, well, I like  to hula.  And then he just started doing this hula dance, and he's spinning his hips like he's working  a hula hoop, and he's just got his arms going, and hula girl, and then he spins around and  blows a kiss to the camera.  Oh.  I had to, I really had to turn, I kicked my television.  I had to pretend to be mad.  Got angry, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Like, what is this garbage?  And I'm just like, look at his eyes.  That sweet smile.  He's just a girl.  That innocence, got that innocence in his eyes.  Those Indian eyes that all look like they're automatically wearing eyeliner.  And he's the best looking girl left.  I have since they've done it.  Well, Melinda Doolittle has no neck and walks around like a robot.  She is Shrek.  Shrek-ish.  Shrek-ish.  But she's so talented, because that face, she's a better singer than that face. 
[00:36:00]  Like, when she's about to sing, I forget that her face is so beat up.  She should win the whole thing, no problem.  But she just looks like a mess.  She looks like she's in her 40s, and you can't be over 28, I guess.  She's going on 30.  I think 30 is the age now.  30 is the age.  And America can't vote for her.  It can't vote for her.  America likes to see.  You know why?  Because during this process, I realized something about this.  I've been anti-American Idol for every year, but I watch it every year. 
[00:36:30]  I've been like, oh, this is, it's like I've been anti.  So, at the beginning, you realize what America votes for.  How America would vote for the presidency is how America votes for American Idol.  It's who you go against.  In the first year, it was Kelly Clarkson.  You know, all-American white girl versus a not-sure-what-he-is black kind of Puerto Rican  dude in that Guarini guy.  So, it's like, of course, an all-American white girl wins.  Second season, it was a homosexual versus a giant black man. 
[00:37:00]  Black Trump's gay.  Black Trump's gay.  I see where you're at.  Gay!  White Trump's black in America.  Black Trump's gay in America.  Now, Fantasia, if I'm not mistaken, the girl she went against at the end was a Jew broad.  Jewish girl versus American black girl.  American black girl wins.  That's a surprise in some sort of long-haired hippie, because you know who ends up voting.  Long-haired hippie type of rocker dude versus all-American white girl.  Yeah.  All-American white girl. 
[00:37:30]  That's easy.  And then goofy, idiotic white boy versus slutty kind of trampy white girl.  That was where it doesn't work.  They should have went for slutty white girl.  America can't.  See, because you've got to go.  A lot of people take American Idol very seriously.  No one votes up until the end.  So that's why it's a lot of disappointments.  And then at the end, that's when rednecks go, damn it, I'm not going to let this be, I am an American.  And this is my idol. 
[00:38:00]  And I am going to vote.  And that's when rednecks galvanize to vote for who's going to be.  I'm not going to let this whatever whatever be my idol.  If it has to be between this one, a homosexual or a giant negro, I will not let a homosexual be my idol.  All right, you're on to something.  Hey, hold on.  We've got someone that wants a threesome here.  George in Queens.  George.  Hey there, George.  Wow, we had a great energy.  George, come on. 
[00:38:30]  Nothing.  Anytime there's silence, I'll just sing Steppin' Out.  Steppin' Out.  All right, George, call back then.  My baby.  All right, we'll go to Lee.  I don't even know the words.  Lee, what's up?  Well, we started talking about threesomes, and we've got another one on the line.  George, that was a good one, but he wasn't there.  Lee, what's up?  Hey, nothing much.  I want to say I got a problem with mine when I did it.  I kissed her and everything else.  I jumped on my girl's trampoline a couple times, and went buck wild on the other girl forever. 
[00:39:00]  And from then on.  Wait, so you...  All right, hold on.  You were being a little selfish.  So everyone agreed to the threesome, and you were being sort of polite with your girlfriend  or wife, whatever, but the new girl, you just went animalistic.  Yeah, yeah, like I was on Lucky Charms or something.  I don't know.  I just sugar wild all over, you know.  You know what the problem is, dude?  And this is the problem with men in general, us right now.  Even though he's living his dream, sort of living his dream, here's what we do. 
[00:39:30]  We do stop the complete honesty process.  Here's what you have to do next time you get in that situation, is explain to her the nature  of why you did that.  Now, I had to explain to my girl, because we had this argument about it.  We watched this prison movie.  Not a prison movie, a prison documentary on E!  And it was about, like, Ohio prison.  And there was this dude, he was the head of the Crips.  Now, I am an out-of-shape, middle-aged man.  Sometimes I'm ready to go sexually, but it's not like I used to be. 
[00:40:00]  This guy was a virile animal.  And my girl could not, she literally sat there, we're watching it, she couldn't keep herself  from going, mmm.  Because I felt that his madness would destroy both of us.  And she was thinking, oh my God, look at this hard, she's thinking in her head what he would  do to me.  So I had to explain to her, look, sweetie, I understand you look at that and you go, oh. 
[00:40:30]  Now, I don't offer what you know this guy's going to offer.  I know I don't sexually.  This guy's in prison, he's mad, he's going to kill her.  You have to explain to her, sweetie.  I love you, but I need, I, do you realize I don't want you around when we're doing threesome.  I am really doing our relationship a favor by, you're doing me a favor by allowing me to  get this out of my system.  But you got to understand, when I want a threesome, I want a different girl. 
[00:41:00]  I want a kiss.  I know I don't kiss you like I used to, because I, ugh, because you're the same.  I, I, nothing I do, men like to manipulate.  That's our problem.  You want to manipulate, you want to see new panties come wiggling down, you want to see  a new, you want to taste a new taste.  Traffling.  Yes.  So, your woman, you have to explain to her, sweetie, you might, that's what you might  have to do, dude.  You might have to get her to, you might have to do a threesome with a dude. 
[00:41:30]  Can't do it.  But see, you can't be like that.  You can't be like that.  If the girl touched me, I got to kill him.  All right, all right, wait, so, so Lee, you ended up kissing the other girl, and that  caused a problem with your wife?  Well, that wasn't the only thing, I mean, the girl, you know, after we was done, you  know, she got frisky, and I got frisky whenever my wife was with it, you know, and, you know,  now 18 years of paying for that little rug rack me and her had, you know, it's just.  She wants her to leave right away, you wanted to cuddle. 
[00:42:00]  I did, too.  I don't want them to leave.  Right.  I kind of want to hold them and look at them, but you still love your girl.  So, Lee, you guys still together?  You're collecting.  Well, we are somewhat together, but I'll tell you what, I just can't go there again because  I might lose total control and kick them.  Yeah, these threes don't sound like a good idea at the time, but it sounds like it causes  a bunch of problems out there.  There's a lot of rules, but you got to, but see, the honesty you use to explain, like,  the, the, the, the, the pimpness that you need to even get your woman to do that, you 
[00:42:30]  need to.  That's my idea.  There you go.  Now, you have to, you got to throw that in her face.  Don't be ashamed to be petty.  Yeah.  Okay, it was your idea.  It was your idea.  What the hell?  Your happiness is key, man.  It was your idea to order the steak, and you know I love steak.  What the hell, man?  You didn't know what this was going to do to me.  Yeah, and, and I.  So I overate.  Jeez, I mean, you know how much I love the steak. 
[00:43:00]  Yes.  How much I'm supposed to do.  I'll tell you, I'll tell you one thing, though, it is one of the greatest things, what  is happening, but the guilt that you get when the girl looks, your girl looks at you and  says, uh, was she better than me?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I love you.  Just always throw love.  Well, you know, love and lust, they both start with L, you know.  No, I love you, baby.  All right, all right, Lee.  I'll punch it out.  Thanks for sharing.  We got to take a break.  We got Patrice O'Neal in studio.  We might have, uh, the story of the month in front of us. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, another candidate.  And, you know, we haven't played in a few days.  We got to play the story of the month for Patrice.  A new bit we do.  All right, let's hear it.  We try to find the best story of the month.  One of those just crazy.  It's got to be real freaky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got a great one that started off the month and now we're just trying to beat it.  And I don't think we're ever going to beat it.  I don't know.  But we got, we got a nomination after the break.  Also, people, uh, they're just starting to wake up on the instant feedback on the phones.  They're starting to like, uh, they're starting to chatter about the dice thing from yesterday. 
[00:44:00]  Ah.  So we'll get into that a little bit today as well.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice energy.  Love having Patrice in.  I love Patrice's take on pop.  That will be so out there and different.  It's insane.  He's crazy.  Patrice will talk.  And for a little while, you're going, I cannot even wrap my mind around what he's saying.  But then, like, you almost start going like, wow, you, yeah, that's, why am I even understanding 
[00:44:30]  what he's talking about?  He goes right, right to basics.  Yeah.  Right back to basics.  He breaks it down to a primal level.  That's his brilliance right there.  Uh, Patrice, we've started this story of the month thing, okay?  Because these crazy stories are popping up every day at this point.  And, uh, we're, we're trying to find the craziest story.  Uh, and I guess we should just play the one that's the current leader.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy's a trip.  Listen to this guy.  You know, I'm going to, I'm going to do it the, the way we did it the first time. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, because it's just, because I, I think there's people out there hearing this for the  first time.  So, let me do this again, and I'll stop after that point.  It gets so much worse than this, Patrice, you can't even imagine.  Yeah.  It takes quite a turn.  Hold on.  Let's get the first part out.  I like them already.  Oh, yeah.  Who doesn't?  Put the first part out, or, uh, the arrested self of a middle school principal selling  drugs.  All right.  So, you got a middle school principal selling drugs out of his office. 
[00:45:30]  He got caught.  Get sent to the principal's office, you leave with some crack.  So.  Isn't that great?  Patrice, I asked you today, how does this get worse?  It gets worse, let's see, one, two, there's three other things happening in this office.  I do believe.  Can I ask you something real quick?  Yeah.  Now, when he's selling them, does it, is it worked out where the students know, it's  the students buying them, and then they do something wrong, so they can be sent to the  office to go buy drugs?  Yeah.  It's a whole school just doing things wrong. 
[00:46:00]  It's a middle school.  So, I'm thinking, uh, wow.  Yeah.  Who is he selling the drugs to?  Yeah, the kids.  All the kids, you think?  I think, I think he's got some outside business.  They're selling it out of his office, which he's like, he's not moving kilos.  He's moving like Tony Montana quantities.  That's what I'm saying.  He has the surveillance system in the back.  He's cursing his wife out.  He got, uh, Nick the Pig, isn't it? 
[00:46:30]  Angel Salazar.  Nick the Pig.  Wait a minute.  It has to be something with the students where, you know, they do something wrong, go to the  principal's office, they go there, sell them the drugs, and they come back with a note  and says, hey, he said.  Everything's cool, yeah.  He gave me a warning and some drugs.  What do you think?  What else he's doing?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something, Mel.  Middle school teacher selling drugs from his office.  Prostitution ring. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Well, there's three things, though, so.  Prostitution ring.  Uh-huh.  Drugs.  Uh-huh.  The only thing left is extortion.  Like, there's no other crime.  Yeah.  It's not murder.  No, yeah.  It's not rape.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  No murder.  Yeah, there's all those four more things to go.  Here we go.  I'll stop it after the next one.  Okay.  If his office, well, that's unbelievable and bizarre enough, but what we've learned tonight,  some police sources say, is shocking.  Well, I'm not going to comment on the circumstances of his arrest. 
[00:47:30]  But it's the circumstances during the arrest of 50-year-old John Ossera that makes this case  incredibly bizarre.  As we first reported, police arrested the Nitsman Middle School principal on drug charges at his  office Tuesday night.  But that's only part of the story.  Tonight, police sources tell me cops were shocked and in disbelief when they stormed his office.  Sources say not only did they find drugs, money, and a pipe, they also found a Sarah completely nude. 
[00:48:00]  So there he is.  Just know what he was doing, too?  They probably didn't say it.  Masturbating to pictures of the eighth graders, like the files.  He had the files all on his desk with Coke.  That's an option that he was taking care of himself.  Yeah, they don't use that word.  They don't use that word.  Yeah, they hate that word.  That's all good.  I think they know what you're saying.  But, yeah, that he was taking care of himself to files of the students. 
[00:48:30]  So, so far we got...  No.  He was up to Z.  We got selling drugs.  Right.  Doing drugs.  Doing drugs.  Naked.  Naked.  He's naked.  That's better.  When the cops come in.  Wait, is that the three things so far?  No, I guess there's more, thank you.  Yeah.  There's at least two more here.  Okay.  This is a baby.  Completely nude.  And watching gay porn with...  Watching gay porn.  Completely nude.  Selling drugs. 
[00:49:00]  The cops must have just been dumbfounded when they bust in.  Oh, God.  How did he get caught?  They just saw a light on in the school?  Yeah.  It's one in the morning.  And a shadow of a fist going up his mouth.  Seeing that flicker, yeah.  What is he making around it?  And he was showing it on the train accident.  He had actual film to click and film.  Oh, like an old school school projector.  He's watching an old stag film.  With no sound. 
[00:49:30]  Old 1957 gay porno reel.  Oh, my God.  This dude is a maniac.  It's so old and dirty you could get a disease just by watching it.  You know what's scary, though?  It scares me about myself.  Is that you go...  You know, I haven't really done anything in my life.  Like, you know, you go...  How did this guy...  He made it through life.  Yeah.  Up to this point.  Up to that point.  He made it through.  He didn't decide that day he was going to be a little freaky. 
[00:50:00]  Like, those intrusive thoughts is he finally came to the problems that were...  The demons that was in his head.  Yeah.  And he got it at the highest level school principal.  We're getting info.  He sold the drugs to undercover cops.  So, they were getting suspicious.  American Films presents...  The Homosexual.  Homosexuals are bound in our cities. 
[00:50:30]  He's just sitting there.  You got the dancing hair.  Yeah.  Got to do that thing that the A.V. kid knew what to do with the eraser or the pencil when  the film screwed up.  Oh, my God.  Here is a homosexual easily identified by his swinging hips and his feminine clothing.  Avoid the homosexual at all costs, for they can turn your son into a homosexual. 
[00:51:00]  1940s voice guy.  What do you think of the American Idol Indian dude?  Now, that kid is cute.  Hubba, hubba.  He should be nose art on the next B-17 that rolls off the assembly line.  Nose art?  Oh, my God.  I'm sure he's a pinup for many a GI overseas.  And that's not gay, right? 
[00:51:30]  Because he's more feminine than manly?  What's going on with him?  Yes, don't make me talk about it.  I'm feeling guilty enough.  Remember, homo equals communism.  Better dead than red or gay.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe this dude, man.  All right, listen.  It gets better.  Oh, it doesn't even end there.  There's one more thing.  Here we go.  This will end it.  Completely nude and watching gay porn with sex toys in his possession. 
[00:52:00]  So he couldn't even just do it himself.  And the thing we said is, why couldn't he just do this at home?  Like, there's some things you can just do at home.  You don't need to be out at your office doing these things.  It ain't evil enough.  He did that.  It really is.  It's like drinking.  You need more and more.  You've got to stop.  More evilness.  He needed more.  He just needed more evilness. 
[00:52:30]  Or perhaps.  Who knows if he's got a wife?  And this was his only sanctuary away from you.  He had a roommate.  Oh, a roommate.  50 some odd years old with a roommate.  Nothing sadder than an old queen, right?  See them walking around like that.  You ever go to the Halloween parade down there?  Down in the village?  It's just nothing but flamboyant gay people.  You never ask that question. 
[00:53:00]  As a matter of fact, is that?  Did you ever go down to Sweet Booty's over on 3rd?  You've been there, right?  Did you ever head to the Mind Shower?  It's a nice place.  Just grab a drink.  Right.  I was thirsty.  I was a little parched.  I figured I'd go into the manhole down there on, you know.  It's always so disconnected from just, you know, you're going down to the gay parade now.  And as a matter of fact, and then we'll go, no, no, no, go ahead.  What's your point there?  What happened?  What's your point, Sweet Jumps?  Sweetie.  Why are you going down there? 
[00:53:30]  And get ready to say, you ever go down there and notice how sad those old queens are?  The old queens.  The old queens.  Yeah, because you walk around and gay seems to be for the young.  Gay is for the young.  It's just not like you see young guys and they're on their floats dressed in their leather with the assless chaps.  One of the most brilliant statements you ever made about the gay community is that A-F-ing is for the young. 
[00:54:00]  It's for the young.  It's one of the most brilliant statements ever uttered by our own Anthony Cumbia.  It's not meant for old people.  So what do you think is the age limit to turn gay?  To turn gay?  To say, I am out of the closet.  Where you go, if you're not gay by now, don't be gay.  Fight it.  I think to turn gay, it's got to be pretty early.  You've got to think of it.  Yeah, you might as well just do it real early.  To be gay.  So you can get a lot of action in. 
[00:54:30]  Like then you can be gay.  Right.  You be gay, you get a lot of action.  You don't want to like turn, you know, decide you're gay in your 60s.  Who the hell is it hitting on you?  What's the point?  I think when you hit like 40, it's over.  No more gayness.  And that's pushing it.  Then you've got to just like abstinence.  It's for the young.  If you're not into chicks, then you've just got to lay off everything.  Because there's just nothing sadder than, like you see these 55-year-old queens walking around the parade. 
[00:55:00]  And they're just, the young guys are looking at them going, ah.  Did you see Richard Dreyfuss in Poseidon?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a sad gay guy.  Sad old queen.  He was just sad that he was in that movie.  You know, they all had lost their life, partner.  Some horrible, tragic disease or something.  The only thing that makes, like, you able to really deal with gay guys really is the idea that they're just somewhere doing some animal stuff in a, you know, in a back out.  Or just some unspeakable act. 
[00:55:30]  But the idea of truly love, gay love, bothers me.  Like, watching the Poseidon and watching Richard Dreyfuss play this really sad gay guy who's going to kill himself over a dude.  And you just want to go, you fruit.  Fruit.  Hey, what's wrong with you?  Like, that's the only thing that makes me susceptible is just.  You're like, that's not why you're gay?  You don't be gay to love men.  You're right.  We were over at the.  You're not gay to actually love.  There's no love. 
[00:56:00]  Get out of here with your love.  I don't want no man's hand cleaning sleep out of my eyes or telling me, picking a crumb out of my beard.  Tucking me in at night.  Take that thumb.  You're drooling, dear.  I get uncomfortable when my woman's feminine hands touch me too much.  Get away from me.  I'm itching.  Man hand gets on you.  That is really some knuckly, veiny hand that's touching me with love.  It's like, if I'm going to be gay, I want your hands only punching me.  All right, listen. 
[00:56:30]  We were over at the office over at the satellite over at XM.  Yeah.  And we're watching a porn tube.  It's the porno version of YouTube.  Sure.  You know, so we're in the office watching that and they have a whole section that's nothing but gay.  So, of course, one of the staff members, I don't even remember who it was.  They, oh, Dan's willing to sell out anybody at the drop of a hat.  Derek.  It was Derek.  He hits the gay tab and now it's nothing but gay videos. 
[00:57:00]  And we're watching just laughing because we've said it before.  Two men having gay sex is just hysterical.  It's the funniest damn thing to watch because there's always one guy who's the guy and then one guy who's playing the part of the woman.  But he's still, you know, a guy and it's blatantly obvious.  It's the er and the e.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the er and the e.  And they're going to town and we're laughing and everything because it's just, I'm sorry.  And a lot of gay people are like, see, this is what we have to overcome. 
[00:57:30]  Now, straight guys are going to watch that and laugh because it's just funny to watch.  It looks silly.  That's all.  And then they lean over and we're laughing and then they start kissing.  And that's when the whole room goes, oh, no.  You can watch the most barbaric sex acts and laugh and go like, oh, my God.  Look, but the second they get intimate with each other is where you draw the line and go, OK, I'm tapping out. 
[00:58:00]  And if I always say it, you joke about it, but I go, you know, if a woman didn't have one, I can understand.  If she didn't have one.  If you go, what is this thing that men have here that's there?  Women have one.  What the hell is it?  What is wrong with you?  All right, listen.  You know, after this conversation, this story is not going to make it a story of the month.  Story of the month. 
[00:58:30]  Let's give it a shot, though.  We've got a British granny in the news.  Patricia Tabram grows her own cannabis plants at her home in Humshoff near Hexham.  She uses the dried leaves to add flavor to her cooking, putting them through a liquidizer before adding the results to casserole soups and her favorite drink, cannabis-laced hot chocolate.  She says the drug relieves her aches and pains and has been running her own publicity campaign alongside the court appearances, extolling what she claims are the benefits of cannabis use. 
[00:59:00]  I'm using it.  I had it this morning in my scrambled eggs.  I'll be having it this afternoon at lunch, and I'm not giving it up.  She's not giving it up.  I'm not giving it up.  She's adding it up.  All her dishes there.  A whole raw bath.  The drug-dealing gay principle?  Yeah.  That's not even close.  It's not even a blip on the radar.  That's a commercial for what he did. 
[00:59:30]  Today at Carlisle Croncourt, she was ordered to do 250 hours community service.  She was fined a thousand pounds, avoiding a prison sentence.  Despite that, she was still defiant.  I think it's typical of the way England has turned in the last 10 years.  We haven't moved forward into the 21st century like the rest of Europe has, or like Canada has, or Australia, or New Zealand.  What happened to America?  All these countries have decriminalized cannabis and are allowing people to grow it in their own home. 
[01:00:00]  Just one plant at a time for use by the people in the family.  Yeah.  That was a very compelling argument she just made right there.  She really did.  One plant, I just pick a few leaves off like it's basil or oregano.  And she's just sprinkling it in.  All right.  Iraq is just looking at pictures of Annabelle, Antonella, Antonella Barbara.  And then he shows like this unbelievable picture of just her back.  And you can see like a booby. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, a little butt crack in the side of her booby.  A booby, you know, peeking out.  Here's the problem, though.  What?  You get to see the butt crack.  He did.  I was ready to yell, scroll down.  And then you did, thank God.  If you're going to have these pictures all over these screens, make sure we get the, you know, the final shot.  Oh, of course.  The money shot.  He was teasing me.  I'm like, will you scroll down so we can see the money shot here, the top of her crack there through the jeans?  He rocks a tease.  Let's go to Big Steve in Jersey.  Big Steve, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, Big Steve. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, my name's Pep, and I'm on the show, and you guys are degrading, degrading fags.  Can I tell you that?  Are you for real?  And I really feel it's the way that you guys talk about it.  It's this guy.  Yeah.  Big Steve.  Oh, shut up.  All right.  You're not going over.  No one's buying into it, sir.  If you're going to try to get to us, you've got to, like, do a much better job. 
[01:01:30]  Get right to the point.  We've been doing this for a long time.  We could sniff you guys out.  Get right to the point.  Well, basically, I love you guys' show, and O.P., I want to, you know, wiggle, wiggle.  Oh, what an awful caller.  You could thank Big Steve for us taking an early break.  It's his fault.  It certainly is.  Let's not forget about MacBook Karaoke, though, before we go here for a second or two.

[01:02:30]  You want to get into the Dice thing next?  Yeah, yeah, that happened over the other side.  It was quite interesting, and we'll talk about it next.  Sure.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I don't see things like you do, Patrice.  I don't see relationships.  You know why?  You're 77 years old.  That's what it is.  You had a heart attack, and that just changed you. 
[01:03:00]  When you reach 77 years old.  It just takes your anger.  Once your aorta's closed up, your anger's gone.  I had a stent put in.  It's fine.  Once you have a balloon to open up your arteries,  you just know more of that visceral meanness.  And you know O.P.'s anger's gone  because he has broccoli and tomato salad every day.  Well, yeah.  Have a piece of steak, you bum.  I eat my steak.  You know?  Absolutely, yeah.  You don't find that the more and more your girl gets comfortable with you, 
[01:03:30]  the more, the harder it becomes.  Like, the more she loves you and the more you are growing.  See, you don't want anyone to love you.  That's your problem.  I'm digging the love thing.  I don't think you want anyone to actually love you.  That's not true.  I don't know.  Because you, like, I don't know.  You don't completely commit with your lady.  He wants the audience to love him.  That's what it is.  He wants love when he hits that stage.  I have no problem admitting I'm loving the love thing. 
[01:04:00]  You don't think she gets, she's getting, the more, okay, you've grown, you didn't start  off just being in love, right?  It was, I got hit hard and early.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Which is kind of, like, different for me.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You just, I love you.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  Pa-dow.  First date.  Oh.  Magic.  First kiss, ridiculous.  Lightning bolts.  Like they say.  I can't talk about that.  Like they say, like they say in movies and stuff.  What do you want me to say?  Love at first sight.  I would love to be Mr. Cool Guy here.  I'm not being cool.  And be a tough dude, but I'm.  It's not being tough. 
[01:04:30]  Who falls in love right away?  What guy?  Dude, look, I'm an older dude.  It happened.  I don't know what to tell you.  What did you fall in love with right away?  It was just a feeling.  Right off the bat.  Do you see what I'm saying?  You don't even know.  A kiss in an alley, if you need to know.  One lousy kiss in an alley, I was done.  And it was.  I knew that.  Your heart start beating faster?  I knew at that moment I was done.  I want to get up and punch you in the face.  Done.  Dude.  I just want to punch you right in your face for that.  You know what?  Who does that?  Who falls in love like that?  But dude, it doesn't fall.  This isn't following a pattern as far as myself and my life goes, though. 
[01:05:00]  I'm telling you.  I'm tough.  It just hits you like that.  It was one of those things.  I'm tough.  Trust me.  I really am.  You see, this is not an arranged marriage like in India.  Did your parents hook you guys up?  Oh, yeah, right.  I think if the parents had it their way, they would not be doing the hooking up.  Opie's parents are Chinese.  In all fairness, they like me now.  But, you know, they're like, shock, shock, older.  What are you doing?  But now I think everyone's getting along just fine. 
[01:05:30]  I want to be loved.  I just don't want you to think that.  I don't want to.  I'm just saying it can be.  And I think more guys are like me than like you where they feel the more they give love,  the less happy they become, the more love you give.  Because girls get abusive and they get a little unappreciative.  The fact that I'm inclined not to love.  I'm inclined to run around and love being selfish. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, see, that is like.  If I stop being selfish, man, that's a big deal, man.  You know, my love is not cheap.  You've made your own definition, I think, of love.  My sex is cheap.  I'm a whore.  To get me sexually, like, and that's the other thing.  My girl, she just know, like, my girl is hot.  I really got a nice looking girlfriend.  Yeah.  But she knows how I am.  She catches me looking at websites.  I'm looking at sweetfatty.com. 
[01:06:30]  A bunch of fat messes with rolls.  And she's sitting there.  Is there really a website, Sweet Fatty?  Sweet Fatty.  It's a thumbnail.  And I just sit there and watch those big monsters.  And I just enjoy them.  I enjoy big, fat girls.  Like those sexy big, fat girls.  How funny is that?  You don't even.  You're just like, ah, this is what I'm looking at.  What can I tell you?  You don't even attempt to hide it.  So it makes her mad.  At least if I was looking at, like, Antonella or a bunch of them, she'd feel like, okay.  But she looks at these messes. 
[01:07:00]  That's the beauty of Patrice, you know.  Most of us, you know, your girl goes into the kitchen or takes a shower.  You're doing some quick searching.  But with you, you're like, ah, it's right in the open.  This is what I like.  What can I tell you?  Sweet fatties.  And fat girls make her sick.  When she sees gorgeous women, she never.  Gorgeous women could be in my face like, oh, you're so funny and blah, blah, blah.  My girl would be like, doo, doo, doo, doo.  As soon as the fat girl is like, hey, boy, I love you.  And then she just knows I'm thinking about sumo wrestling. 
[01:07:30]  I'm thinking about arm wrestling this big fat girl.  Because I do like fat girls like that.  All right, listen, listen.  We've got to go to Paul and Yonkers.  I put myself out there.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, you're making me sick over here.  Thank you.  I was trying on that romantic sweet kiss in the alleyway.  Yeah.  Was he hanging upside down by a spider web?  Yeah.  You know, in the rain.  It was raining.  Did he pull some of his mask up?  Yeah.  Not yet.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  All right.  Like, most guys don't have it. 
[01:08:00]  Hey, let's move on.  No.  Wait a minute.  Let me just say why you can't fall in love with a woman first.  Let me just say it can't happen for us.  All right.  They're not selling anything other than their looks in the beginning.  Like, that girl is gorgeous.  Look, I needed to be.  And that's all she needed to be.  You know what?  You're absolutely right.  But, you know, I still needed info.  I wasn't just taking it aside.  You just said you loved it like that.  Well, but I still had to, you know, make sure, you know, this was right. 
[01:08:30]  I think you fall for a girl first because of her looks.  Absolutely.  But then, after that, you're hoping there's something else there.  Or you're moving on to the next girl that you think is hot.  So, how long was it?  So, all together before you say I love this girl now.  I'm official.  I mean, I didn't say I love you for, you know, a while after that.  But, you know, I was having some feelings.  I'm like, wow, this is crazy.  But then I obviously had to get more info and get to know her. 
[01:09:00]  Yes, of course.  One more question.  Oh, bro.  One more question.  I'm sweating like a pig.  Listen, one more question.  Someone give me a towel.  Did you ever, and this is a question to you, too.  Yeah, why don't you point at him?  I'm asking.  Get it off on me.  Listen.  What?  He's there with his doe eyes.  Ask him a question.  Did you ever go through a frivolous woman time in your life?  Frivolous.  Meaning just enjoy your sexiness for like a good two years where you just, where it was 
[01:09:30]  numbers, it was numbers, not quality.  You ever go through that?  It was a period of time, yeah.  You know what I'm saying to you?  Yeah.  Were you juggling like five, six?  He was married for a while.  Years ago.  Like, he did that when he was younger, like anyone else, but then he was married for  a very long time.  You juggled back in the day?  Yes.  All right.  Fair enough.  That's all I need to know.  Jesus.  Let me make sure y'all at least juggled.  Oh, juggling.  Let me make sure y'all juggled a couple of times.  All right, listen.  Y'all really make me sick with your covert relationships. 
[01:10:00]  You make me sick.  Well, we make, you make us sick that you can't feel love, all right?  I do feel love.  You're loveless.  You make sure I take my diabetes pills every day.  You're loveless.  She shakes on my high blood pressure.  She loves me.  I love her, too.  You got some brilliant theories and all, but you're loveless.  You're scared of commitment.  You're scared of love.  I love my girl.  Why would you say that, man?  It's the Patrice O'Neill definition of love.  I love my girl, man.  I love, I willingly give, I willingly give. 
[01:10:30]  How sad would you be if she left you?  As sad as I could be.  For how long?  Until I found a 19-year-old.  Let's see.  How long would you be saying?  I'd be devastated, to be totally honest.  Would you stop doing a radio show?  No.  Not that devastated.  Maybe for a while.  Maybe I'd have to take a week or two.  Maybe I'd have to take a little time to take a vacation.  Not that devastated.  Not that devastated.  I got to lay on a beach for a couple weeks. 
[01:11:00]  And you know what?  Him just saying that, going to give him some problems later.  You wouldn't stop doing my radio show if I left her?  You wouldn't watch.  You know she's cool.  She doesn't play it that way.  She's cool.  All right, listen.  How do you know, Patrice?  Yeah.  Yeah, how good do you know?  I've talked to Lynn.  I've talked to her before.  Stop.  You can say her name.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know if you said her name.  Just, you know.  I've talked to her before.  All right, but just keep it, you know, small talk, all right?  It is small talk.  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  I asked how big you were.  I'm trying to entertain the people at the Hard Rock.  And I'm like, where's my girl?  Where's Patrice?  Small talk is okay.  She knows I'm a nice guy.  And then she comes back.  Well, you know, he hinted, maybe we should all go out to dinner someday.  I'm like, no.  What that is.  Dinner will be under, like, a wooden box with a stick with a string tied to it.  Because the dinner is. 
[01:12:00]  Small talk is good.  She's, I don't know anymore.  All I know.  See, I have a dilemma here.  I really do.  Because I really do like Patrice.  I've hung out with him just a little bit.  I'm not trying to make it sound like, you know, we're best of friends.  But we've gone out to dinner a couple times.  And we've had a really good time.  And my girl really likes you a lot.  Thinks you're really funny.  And she likes your lady.  But I know what you guys do.  So I.  It can't happen.  But if she's not into that.  First of all, stop being so selfish. 
[01:12:30]  That's what.  Second of all.  She may.  She.  Have you ever discussed that?  What?  You ever.  Talk about that with her?  She would never go for that.  We talked about this the other day on the show.  I couldn't get past the jealousy part.  I think a lot of guys.  Of another woman?  Just.  Just.  Yeah.  You would be jealous of another woman being there?  I couldn't do it.  It's too weird, man. 
[01:13:00]  We were actually.  The discussion was about swinging in general.  Where you just swap it.  I'm like.  No.  The jealousy would kill me.  I think guys in general have that fantasy.  Want to see their girls doing other things.  But then I think there's a jealousy part.  And if you have that.  That's why you never pull the trigger and go there.  I couldn't handle that.  Let me have both of y'all this question.  I could not handle that.  If.  You was doing a threesome.  You.  Your girl.  Another girl.  Or put it this way.  You ever have sex with your woman.  And you be. 
[01:13:30]  Why y'all having sex?  You just have an intrusive thought like.  Boy.  I wish somebody was doing something else somewhere.  That she can't do something right now.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Like she might be on top of you.  And then you go.  Wow.  I want somebody to be.  Doing something.  I need something held.  Or something touched.  Why she's doing what she's doing.  What?  Like an extra set of hands or something?  Yes.  Like.  I wish a girl was up here.  While my girl might be down there.  I want a girl up here.  Kissing me. 
[01:14:00]  And I'm holding her.  And my girl's doing something else.  You never just wanted more.  Dude.  Are you?  Do you have a sensation that you can't get with just one?  That's like fantasy stuff.  But you know.  When you're having sex.  It's like you're in that moment.  I guess it would be nice.  But.  You enjoy that.  But here's the question.  You want more.  You're thinking pile on.  See.  Jesus Christ.  You know.  The answer is.  It's just like.  Nah.  If you're going to be honest.  The answer is.  Yeah.  That would be.  That would be nice.  But here's the question I got for you.  Are you ever just completely satisfied with just having sex with your lady? 
[01:14:30]  I find this a lot of times after we do that.  I love her a lot more than I did before we did.  Like when we do it.  There you go.  I'm just being honest.  Like I really go.  Man.  I love.  I just love that she is a soldier.  That's what I'm saying.  Man.  I got to.  If I'm the general man.  I have me.  All right.  Listen.  Go ahead.  A top lieutenant.  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:15:00]  She's a soldier.  That's what I was saying before.  He gets the same feeling.  This is the exact same thing a serial killer feels.  Right.  After him and his girl have murdered people.  Right.  He's like.  Baby.  As they're covered in blood.  After they hack the body up.  They go.  I love you.  I'm really turned on.  You are the best natural born killers, but only with sex.  He's upset.  But you are.  He's obsessed today because he keeps going back to relationships and threesomes and sex.  Well.  No.  I was just asking you, sweetie.  I just was wondering.  I just don't know. 
[01:15:30]  We had a moment yesterday on the show.  We want to kind of like, you know, work through it.  Yeah.  For this side of the program.  And then there's people on some of the message boards.  Watch.  They're going to replay this tomorrow.  Of course we're going to replay this.  Like we would do on any radio show.  And when you have a moment, you've got to play it again and talk about it a little bit.  That's why we're getting ripped off at XM.  Because now they're going to take this moment and they're going to bring it over to the free side and play it for everybody.  Yeah.  If you don't understand why we have to replay this, then I don't know what to tell you. 
[01:16:00]  It's not like the old days.  Oh, when we would have played it three or four times.  Go get an iPod because this isn't for you.  What are you going to play?  I'm getting excited now.  I'm getting excited from yesterday's show.  See, there's this thing that has happened with Dice.  Dice used to do Howard's show back in the day.  Whatever.  And then he had a falling out with Howard.  And then club starter Kenny actually was listening to our radio show back in the day and heard Anthony doing Dice. 
[01:16:30]  To the point where Anthony did Dice back in the day to the point where people would call.  They really thought Dice was now part of this radio show.  Right.  Like, no one heard from him for a while and they're like, oh my God, I guess he's doing radio.  You are good at doing that, though.  Thank you, sir.  I listened yesterday.  It's crazy, right?  I swear I thought it was him.  It's crazy.  So, all of a sudden, Kenny told Dice, you got to hear this impression.  It's unbelievable.  And Dice even admitted that it's the best Dice impression he's ever heard.  And then we started a thing.  We started a thing. 
[01:17:00]  We became like, quote, I say quote friends because we kind of knew even right from the beginning what we were getting ourselves into that he would eventually just be bored and move on to something else.  Right.  And we did some good radio.  We sold a lot of concert tickets for him.  We got him back at Madison Square Garden.  We sold over 10,000 tickets for a Madison Square Garden show, even though it was Game 5 of the World Series against the Mets and Yankees.  That's an unbelievable feat.  Also, the week before, he played two sold-out shows at the Beacon that we helped sell out. 
[01:17:30]  So we had a really nice relationship.  We got fired, and the relationship continued.  The guy would call me at home.  We were, quote, I'll say it in quotes, quote friends.  He called me all the time.  We talked for hours on the phone.  When I went out to L.A., we still hung.  And then out of nowhere, he kind of turned his back on Jim Norton.  He turned his back on Club Soda Kenny after 13 years of service with no explanation whatsoever.  And then we followed suit.  Out of nowhere, he decided he had a problem with us. 
[01:18:00]  And to this day, we don't know what the problem was.  Can you speculate at all?  Well, his latest is that we disrespected him in front of his kit.  Yeah, that never happened.  When we were getting ready to do the Madison Square Garden show, I guess a lot of this is going to be explained in the clip.  But all of a sudden, he wanted Man Cow at the show at Madison Square Garden.  We hate Man Cow.  Like, what are you doing bringing this guy into our backyard?  It's unacceptable.  And we've been promoting and presenting the show.  It was Dice Clay at Madison Square Garden presented by Opie and Anthony. 
[01:18:30]  And then you've got Man Cow on TV just bragging that he's bringing Dice back to Madison Square Garden.  Because, you know, with Dice and the Madison Square Garden thing, that was the big thing.  And he did nothing to sell tickets because he wasn't and hasn't been in New York.  So we had a confrontation on our show, but we hashed it out.  The show went off flawless, and everyone was very happy.  And our relationship continued for at least another year radio-wise after that. 
[01:19:00]  And then the two years I was off the air, when I was in L.A., I was still hanging with the guy.  No sign of a problem, but out of nowhere, he decides it's a problem.  So yesterday we get word that Dice was calling Brother Weez's show in Rochester.  To promote his new TV show.  Yeah, who's my mentor in this business.  Was the problem ever, like you said you guys were the quote signs friends,  was there ever like a problem personally, or the problem just became on the radio a problem? 
[01:19:30]  Do you know what I'm saying?  We don't know what the problem is.  No, I'm saying, did he ever go, put it this way, was it all, Opie and Anthony's this,  or was it like, yo, Greg, you make me sick, and this is what I did?  Well, he went on Howard and then completely tried to destroy us.  And it's like, wow, that's kind of weird.  Never a call, never like a phone.  Dude, he has my phone numbers.  We were hanging out.  I was in his apartment because he got kicked out of his house in L.A.  We were sitting there as friends.  And you would think at that moment, or sometime within that time period,  he would pick up the phone and go, look, dude, I got to tell you something. 
[01:20:00]  You've done a lot for me, but this is what's been eating away at me.  Nothing.  But then he went on Howard and he needed to start up some type of noise, I guess.  So he decided he hates us now, which is so bizarre.  And he does all this behind the scenes, and he's a pussy.  He all of a sudden turns his back on people, many, many people over the years,  but he never gives anyone an explanation.  He does it that way.  He doesn't have the balls to confront anyone.  So yesterday we get word that he's calling Brother Weez's show. 
[01:20:30]  And we're like, hey, we got to hear what this is all about.  And Brother Weez goes to bat for me no matter what because we're really, really tight.  He's like, you know, I said yesterday.  So there's no co-signs we're doing, Brother Weez.  No, no.  No, I knew when we started hanging with Dice that it would end bad eventually  because his reputation even back then, you just knew.  But it was fun, and we went with it.  He gave us, I'm not going to lie to you, he gave us great radio.  It was a lot of fun back in the day.  So we got the clip from yesterday's show.  We get word that he's going to be on Weez's show. 
[01:21:00]  And I just wanted to ask him, all right, what is the problem with us, Opie and Anthony?  If you hate us, then tell us to our face.  Instead of going on Howard all brave and stuff and talking your mouth off,  here's an opportunity to confront the guy one-on-one.  And this is how it went down.  Anthony really helped this guy's career after it was gone.  His comeback.  Anthony did.  They helped it immensely.  And then Andrew Dice did.  Yeah, we should add here that we're now, we're on hold, 
[01:21:30]  and we're just listening to Brother Weez's show.  So we're commenting, but Weez can't really hear us.  We're just kind of listening in.  Did a thing on TV, mentioned about this big comeback he had,  how he filled these rooms, never gave those guys their due.  Right.  Which is right.  This is why Weez is the grass.  I'm going to try and mother-hucker Andrew Dice Clay.  I'm not really suck at this, but I've got to do it for Opie.  I've never seen a side of you.  It's going to be fun.  I don't know if I can even pull it.  The evil side of Opie.  Another Jewish guy.  Oh, you're already crumbling.  I'm already crumbling. 
[01:22:00]  You're already crumbling.  I can't.  He doesn't have it in him.  He doesn't.  By the end, you'll be loving him.  I didn't learn this from Weez.  I learned a lot from him, but not this.  See, then it'll be good.  Now, he's pushing his new reality show he's got,  following Dice.  Yeah.  Undisputed Dice on PH1.  Which I believe he's on the phone.  Sunday night at 10.  I believe he's on the phone.  Sunday nights at 10 starting.  He's already been on.  He's got a, I don't believe it has.  He's got a fiance who's a female wrestler now.  Damn.  That's interesting. 
[01:22:30]  I mean, he's got a blower off for a broad in Houston for a while,  but maybe he's not going to mention that on his TV show.  Do they have them?  Or are they just a man?  A waitress at a comedy club in Houston.  I never see it.  You never saw girl wrestlers?  No.  Back in our day, they looked great.  We had them like crazy.  Behemoths.  How come whenever I turn on the TV and I don't look at it much,  I always see dudes with the hot chick manager act,  but not broads wrestling?  No, every one of those programs has at least one girl match.  I'm always missing.  Remember back in the day, Galo, the gorgeous lady and the woman wrestling? 
[01:23:00]  I saw the kickboxing girls the other night.  I was over at Moe's.  I don't know if you were to do it.  Well, hold on.  I'm getting mother-huggered.  Now, it says on the line here.  What?  It says dice in three minutes.  What am I supposed to do?  Count it down?  It's like a shuttle.  Moe.  Is he going to find out when the guy's on the...  What am I supposed to do?  Look at my watch?  I have a great story here that we didn't do today.  We got tons of that. 
[01:23:30]  No, but this one's...  We can't get into something and then stop.  They're in filler mode.  I love it.  When another show is on.  Yeah, wow.  This is what it sounds like.  I got three minutes to fill.  I don't want to talk about that.  Yeah, don't say it.  Don't talk about that.  You know, people died on the expressway.  Oh, that was crazy.  Yes, sir.  Two died in multiple car accident.  It was really terrible.  I guess somebody came across the median and slammed that.  Let's help out this show for three minutes.  Oh, okay.  Here, hold on a minute.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, what do you need?  Hey, I don't know if we may or may not know this, but Hopi and Anthony don't need no 
[01:24:00]  help on beating up Andrew Dice Clay.  Well, with Andrew, actually, on the phone, they do.  That's what they would want.  You don't understand.  Okay.  That may be.  I just...  Well, they're listening for a reason.  You understand?  Put it this way.  If you and I were friends, you hear me?  Yes, sir.  If you and I were friends and you had a radio show and I had a radio show and you were interviewing 
[01:24:30]  someone I was pissed off at, I would want you to be mean to that person.  See what I'm saying?  I understand, yep.  That's what it's all about.  I didn't know if you may or may not have known that they have lambasted the guy.  Well, I figured.  I don't know because I don't get a chance to listen.  They lambasted him, but he's not on the air with them.  But he's not there.  What's going on with them?  Right.  Right.  Because he knows he's going to be crushed.  Right.  See what I'm saying?  And I agree with that.  Like I said, it's none of my business.  This is the bleeding heart, you know, liberal guy. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, are you trying to...  Bro, I'm right with you.  So you're trying to say I shouldn't be mean?  All right, we're ready.  Hey, Dice.  Bro, the wheeze.  What's going on, Dice?  It's been a long time.  You don't remember the wheeze?  Yes, I do.  Come on.  We spoke a long time ago.  As a matter of fact, aren't you friends with...  Who are you friends with?  Mancow?  No, I don't like the mancow.  I'm best friends with Opie.  Oh, okay.  And Opie's...  I knew it was somebody that I was talking to.  Yeah, I'm best friends with Opie.  Opie worked here with me when he was a young, handsome boy. 
[01:25:30]  And now, of course, they're bigger than the...  They're bigger than the king of all media, baby.  Uh-huh.  Bigger than the king of all media.  And I hear you...  It's good that you're a supporter.  Pardon me?  It's good that you're a supporter.  Supporter ain't the word.  Man, I'd do anything for the Opie.  And, you know, Opie called me up and said that he's mad at you.  But, you know what?  Are we here to talk about Opie?  Are we here to talk about my new show?  Pussy.  Pussy.  You know what?  Because if I have a problem with somebody, you know, I go head-to-head with that person, 
[01:26:00]  not with some...  No middle man.  No middle man.  You know what I mean?  No, look at my boy Bill.  And me and you have a good relationship, so there's no reason for us to get into anything.  No, I just feel bad.  Remember us talking.  That's what I'm saying.  Okay, listen to me.  All I'm saying, we'll end there.  We'll talk about the show.  Is, you know, I feel bad for the fellas because they helped you out a lot.  Well, I feel I really helped them out a lot.  And, you know, maybe that's something that one day we could talk about.  I hope so. 
[01:26:30]  Hey, does Opie want to chime in?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is he on?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  That's what I'm trying to do.  Are you bringing this up?  You know what I mean?  Well, I'll tell you what, Doug.  That's pretty cool.  Hey, Dice.  I'll tell you what happened.  Dice.  Just before we went on the air with you, I was telling my audience, because I'm a bleeding-heart liberal  and I don't know how to do mean radio.  I said, I got to try because Opie, in the whole story, I just told you what you know  about.  And I said to the audience, I'm not good at this.  I can't mother-hucker people, you know, just to do it. 
[01:27:00]  So that's the deal, like you just said.  But I felt I owed it to Opie.  Well, that's cool.  You're being his friend.  And that's what's important.  That's what I was trying to do.  He doesn't know about friends.  Coming out, you know, people will read about my problems that I had with them.  Oh, Christ.  Well, you know, obviously you should call me out.  Get me on.  Yeah, well, you know what?  Get me on now! 
[01:27:30]  Like a relative to him and a buddy.  I am very close.  You're heavy on this.  You, like, really feel bad about this.  Well, hold on a second.  What's the matter?  Oh, are you there?  Wheeze.  Yeah.  Dice, what is your problem?  I think you lost him.  Oh, I think you lost him.  Of course, of course we lost him.  Effin' pussy.  Did he hang up?  Did he hang up?  Oh, man.  I gave it a shot.  Oh, the best my liberal ass can do.  You did a good job, man. 
[01:28:00]  It totally shook him up.  And then, yeah, who's the pussy now?  He has nothing against us.  We did nothing but support that guy.  I just think that he's a liar because he said that if he had a problem, he would go  to your face, not a middleman.  And he won't go to your face.  He's got phones and you could get rid of the studio.  Wait, hold on.  He just did it.  He had a face to face and he hung up.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's the real dice.  There's the real dice.  He's turned his back on all his friends and everyone that has helped him out with no  real good reason. 
[01:28:30]  No good reason whatsoever.  Now, you know, you just made me break a big rule.  What?  What happened?  I'm Jewish.  I'm Jewish.  It is Jewish.  Yeah, you guys got to stick together, right?  Yeah, maybe.  Did you hear what he said to me?  Did I sound more like a relative than a friend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said you goddamn right.  I didn't say that.  Weez is like a father figure to me, a brother to me, and like one of my best friends in the  whole world.  He covers all those categories.  Let me explain to your audience really fast, Brother Weez. 
[01:29:00]  The only thing Dice has on us, and it's really, really shaky, when we were helping him get  back into Madison Square Garden, we ended up selling well over 10,000 tickets for Dice.  He needed our show.  We were huge in New York when that was all going on.  We sold 10,000 tickets, even though it was Game 5 of the World Series against the Mets  and the Yankees.  Oh, my God.  And we pushed, and we pushed, and we pushed, and this was after he sold out two dates  at the Beacon a week earlier, okay?  And he admitted that we were really, really supportive, and we were the reason why. 
[01:29:30]  Responsible for him selling those tickets.  Yeah, exactly, okay?  Now, here's the deal.  Also, out of nowhere, Mancow, who we all hate, I mean, we could all agree, us, Weez,  and even Howard Stern, we all hate Mancow.  Out of nowhere, Mancow starts jumping on TV, he's doing that, you know, Fox slot, and he's  starting to talk and saying, yeah, I'm bringing Dice to Madison Square Garden, that's what  I'm doing, I'm presenting Dice. 
[01:30:00]  You're like, what the, wait a minute, we are, we're going on every day pushing this thing.  So a day or two before the big show at the Garden, Dice comes in with his kid, and he  says that I was yelling at his kid and stuff, I wasn't, I was yelling at Dice, because  all of a sudden he's like, yeah, Mancow's flying down from Chicago for this big show  that I'm doing at the Garden, I'm like, are you kidding, do you understand the relationship  we have with Mancow, that is unacceptable.  Wait, was he putting him on the stage?  He was going to be at the show, meaning he's going to be backstage and all that, I'm like, 
[01:30:30]  look, dude, this is our backyard, you can't have Mancow come to the show knowing that  we don't get along with that guy whatsoever.  Amen.  So it got a little ugly in studio, and his kid just happened to be in the studio, so now  he's spinning it, even though we had a great show at the Garden, ended up having a great  relationship, even after I got fired and Ant got fired, I hung out with him in LA, went  to a gym with him, and hung out at his apartment, he showed me all those tapes that have now become  this TV show, by the way, years before it happened, hung out at the club, we went hiking 
[01:31:00]  together, there was no problems whatsoever.  Somewhere along the line, he got in his head that I disrespected his kid.  You hurt my feelings, I was very hurt, I mean, it's tender dice now.  That's the...  He's not funny how he has put to find himself so much.  At least I got a little dice interview here.  Yeah, ask some questions.  Yeah, brother wheeze.  Yes, sir, how's that TV show?  I'm looking forward to it.  Hey, it's great, you could see me actually on the bottom of the barrel. 
[01:31:30]  This is where I completely sell out, and I turn into a wussy.  I sit there, I cry, I put myself out there.  You know, there's, there's a, I got a poster in my room.  It's of footprints in the sand.  And, and during the hardest part of my life, there was only one said, and I went, Jesus,  where was you?  And he said, dice, I'm carrying you.  And I started well enough, I'm crying, yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, dice, you're, uh.  And, uh, you know, dice, you're going to be selling out Giants Stadium, right?  Yeah, I'm selling out Giants Stadium.  How the hell is that ever going to happen?  During a Giants game.  Right.  I'm going to beat it.  I didn't say who's playing.  And I, you know, I saw this trailer for that, not for a minute.  Yeah.  I didn't even know that Cat had a show coming on.  And they, that's actually what they're trying to do, right?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  He's telling everyone he's going to sell out Giants Stadium again. 
[01:32:30]  It would be really easy to trash his TV show.  I, I watched it.  I'm interested in it because I know all the players and stuff.  And I've been in the, I've been in the hotel rooms with dice when he just babbles all night  and stuff.  It's kind of interesting because he makes a thing out of everything.  But, but this thing with the kid is so ridiculous.  All these guys in this studio right now were there that day.  I didn't disrespect this kid.  We had a real problem with him because out of nowhere he wanted man cow at his, uh, you know,  Madison Square Garden show.  But we still did the show.  Matter of fact, uh, it was, there was an empty Madison Square Garden. 
[01:33:00]  We're backstage and he grabs me.  He goes, come here, come here.  This is such a special day.  I want to, I want to remember this moment.  We walked out in the middle of Madison Square Garden when no one was around.  The place is empty.  They're cleaning up.  And we took a photograph together.  He was so happy that we got him back at the garden.  You could do that now during the Giants Stadium show.  Yeah.  This is what I'm asking you.  Do you think that he seriously believes he's going to sell Giants Stadium?  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's delusional.  Yeah, he is pretty delusional.  But he's a backstabber.  One of his old guys works for us now.  He gave 18 years of service. 
[01:33:30]  He ain't going to say anything.  And I understand that.  But 18 years of service.  Dice just blew him off like, uh, without even an explanation.  That's the type of guy he is.  He's a bridge burner, yeah.  And then, you know, the crap he used to say about Howard when he was coming on our show.  But conveniently, he, you know, goes back on Howard's show.  You know, he's lost.  Help me, Jesus.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Who's watching?  I don't even know what network it's on.  VH1.  VH1.  And we just gave you a moment, too, because Dice hung up.  Everyone heard it. 
[01:34:00]  Dice hung up on Weezer's show.  I face the people.  Face to face.  Who's that?  I'll be fine.  That was it.  Because he knows he's right.  He knows, you know, we're right.  He's just trying to, you know, create some kind of drama that is based on nothing.  Well, I mean, he looks so bad.  I mean, maybe he's Howard Stern Jr. or both pussies.  Yeah.  I mean, how does a guy hang up when he's got a chance to talk to a guy who he just said he would go head-to-head with?  Yeah.  Oh, he totally nailed it as far as that's concerned. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, he said he'd go head-to-head not knowing.  Oh, it's right there on the phone.  Yeah.  He gets the opportunity and doesn't go head-to-head.  He hung up.  Look, I didn't puss out.  There you go.  I was right there to confront him.  And I was going to just ask him, like, what's your problem, Dice, with us?  Explain your problem with us.  No, he's not going to send somebody over to my house for ambushing him, is he?  He went on Howard and said he's going to wait for me outside my apartment and all that fun.  With flowers.  I'm sorry.  What are you going to sell at Giant Stadium? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, of course.  I think Dice is going to warm up for Jesus' coffin.  They're going to actually bring the coffin on stage at Giant Stadium.  By the way, I hope you can kick the crap out of that kid.  Out of him?  Yeah.  But you know what?  I went on YouTube last night to look at old Dice clips.  Yeah.  I forgot what a bloated fat he had on this shirt that said Dice Gym or something, and  he's walking around this circular stage.  With man breasts.  And man breasts in the bad fashion from the 80s with the pants that are tapered at the  ankle.  Really ballooned out of the hammered hand. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  I go, I have a funny feeling this guy still dresses this way and walks around this way.  Hey, you know how hard it is to find a bedazzler these days?  To put the studs on my jacket?  They used to sell them all over TV.  I got that.  I got the little pocket fisherman and the bedazzler.  I went to Gold's Gym with Dice in L.A.  I had the worst workout in my entire life.  He all of a sudden throws like 10-pound weights at me and says, all right, curl this.  I'm like, dude, are you looking around this room? 
[01:36:00]  There's animals in here that were just let out of prison, and he wants me to do 10-pound  curls, and he thinks this is a workout.  I'm like, Dice, let's just go somewhere else.  Do the fellas in the gym get excited when the Dice is in the house?  They kind of all were laughing at him because he wasn't really doing a real workout.  He just walks around.  Is he chubbed up?  He's always been chubbed up, you know?  Yeah.  There was a clip we were watching on his show where he goes to the beach and goes in the  water, and he waited until the water was up to his neck and then took his shirt off 
[01:36:30]  and threw his shirt at somebody on the beach.  Yeah.  So you couldn't really get a good look.  That's what I used to do when I had the pimples on my back when I was a kid.  Right?  Same thing.  I hear you.  Thanks a million, brother.  Anthony, we love you some.  Hey, thanks, man.  All right, guys.  That was fantastic.  Hey, Weez, you're the man, man.  What can I tell you?  All right.  Brother Weez, everybody.  All right.  We're back live.  That was the drama from yesterday.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  He couldn't hang up fast enough.  No.  Unbelievable.  He wussed out.  He completely wussed out.  Instead he was going to face you.  And his show is called Undisputed.  Yeah.  Undisputed.  Wimp.  Undisputed king of has-beens, I guess.  I don't know.  Whatever.  There you go.  We got a break.  Oh, the FMQB thing.  Yeah, they wrote about it on FMQB.com.  All right.  We'll take a break and we'll continue.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[01:37:30]  O and A, uncut, and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus spreading across America.  So a few people are bitching that we just play that dice clip again.  I just got an email from Eric Logan, our boss over at XM. 
[01:38:00]  Holy crap, that was unbelievable.  I missed that yesterday.  See, even Elo missed it.  He's our boss and he missed it.  So shut up.  And he listens to the show probably more than almost anybody.  Yeah.  People got to understand the overall game of the Opie and Anthony show.  They just got to understand it a little better.  That's the rules of any show.  Like, you know, a majority of the people aren't going to hear what you're doing at any given moment. 
[01:38:30]  When you have a moment, you got to replay that moment during a different time of the show because there's a whole new audience listening in general.  By the way, the ONA pest can have fun.  Yeah.  With dice.  Have a ball.  Oh, go ahead.  Enjoy that one.  I know it'll drive them nuts.  A couple other things.  I think a bunch of people are going to be hanging out in Huntington this Sunday.  Got the St. Paddy's Day Parade in Huntington Village this weekend. 
[01:39:00]  So FH Riley's, my brother's joint, is going to be rocking.  We're going to be there all day Sunday.  I'll be buying beers for whoever's around.  Oh.  No problem.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  We'll definitely be there this Sunday.  And then next Saturday night, St. Paddy's Day, it's an all-out blast, an all-out party.  Like, this weekend is more of a hang, but next Saturday, you're even going, right, Ant?  Yes, I am.  We're doing karaoke at my brother's joint for St. Paddy's Day, FH Riley's, next Saturday night, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village. 
[01:39:30]  I think the only one not going is, like, Jimmy because he's going to be in L.A. or something.  He's got a gig.  Also, other show news.  Next week, we give away a Wii.  Yeah.  We're giving away a Wii next week.  We're looking for guys.  You want a couple of broads or what?  A couple of women?  Or you want just guys?  No, this show's been too gay.  Yeah.  We need girls no matter what.  Yeah, yeah.  Get some women.  All right.  So we need some girls.  We need some guys to come in next week to try to win a Wii.  Yes, a Wii. 
[01:40:00]  You might ask, how are we going to give away a Wii?  We're going to show you we have bulls.  Yeah.  We're going to show you we have bulls.  Right.  We're getting a bunch of people to come down here, and there will be water, and there will  be a Wii.  We're doing Up for Grabs.  Wii for a Wii.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  We're doing Wii for a Wii.  We're going to show the entire radio community how to do this bit the right way.  It can be done without killing people.  That's right.  Now, what's she look like? 
[01:40:30]  The girl that died from doing this?  No, this Chinese girl you're giving away.  I don't know, Wii.  I'm sorry.  Chang Wii?  Yeah, she's hot.  So I think it's going to be next Thursday.  How are we getting contestants?  Do you want people to just show up and we'll go eeny, meeny, miny, moe, or what?  What do you want to do?  How do we do this?  You got Tando Wii.  Yeah.  You got to be a little brave.  You got to be a little brave.  Yeah.  But there was a lot of controversy with this girl that died, you know, doing the Wii for 
[01:41:00]  a Wii thing, and then we're telling the rest of America and the rest of radio, you  could do it.  You could do a contest like this.  Can I make a suggestion?  I don't know.  You probably got it because you got to be a genius.  No suggestions.  Genius.  No suggestions.  Nothing?  Mm-mm.  No.  Mm-mm.  No suggestions.  Off the record?  Write it down.  Yeah, write it down.  Write it down.  Give me a pen.  I'm not good at writing.  Yes, you are.  Don't start that stereotype or continue that stereotype. 
[01:41:30]  Start.  I know.  I said start.  It's simple.  Yeah.  A Wii for a Wii.  Wii for a Wii.  Yeah.  Obviously, promotion of the same name had a few problems, let's say.  And there will be lots and lots of water on hand.  Yeah.  You might have heard the girl drank way too much and she never took her leak and went  home and died.  And died.  So.  And then the, I guess, radio show got fired. 
[01:42:00]  Mm-hmm.  And we want to show the rest of America and especially the radio community that you can  do.  That Wii for a Wii can be done.  You can do it.  What?  You're buzzing.  Huh?  How's it?  Oh.  No.  I don't want the fact that the game does what it does.  You like the game?  No.  You play the Wii?  Yeah.  You're a video gamer.  I can't find it.  Yeah.  You can't find it.  Well, that's why we want to give one away.  It's hard to find. 
[01:42:30]  Because Than's buying them all up to make people think they're popular.  No.  You can't find them.  All right.  You can find a PlayStation 3 now, but you can't find it.  No.  We'll have more details on Monday.  But yes, we are doing the Wii for Wii contest on the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  And I know a lot of people out there are looking at their radios like, what?  You're going to get yourselves in trouble.  Well, the faithful listeners don't like when we take chances with this fine radio show.  But we have to.  We have to.  Yeah.  We've got to kick it up a little bit.  You can't lose your balls. 
[01:43:00]  You can't lose your balls if you're doing this type of show.  So we are doing the Wii for Wii contest.  Absolutely.  No one can stop us.  Nope.  We'll do it in a parking lot if we have to.  Yep.  By ourselves with megaphones.  We're doing it.  A Wii for a Wii next week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Also, we've got to put to bed Eric and Kathy for now.  We've been showing Chicago some love this week because they're liking the show a little bit more in Chicago.  And we're looking at some of the shows that are better than us in Chicago, and we just don't get it. 
[01:43:30]  There's this show, Eric and Kathy, we've been beating up all week.  Next week, we take a look at Buffalo Radio.  Buffalo.  We take a look at Buffalo Radio.  So get together your Buffalo hack radio show clips.  Yeah.  Or you can make a suggestion.  Yeah, sure.  You know, turn us on to one of the really, really bad shows.  So, Patrice, you do a lot of radio interviews.  You do any of these, like, couple shows?  Like, it's the guy and the girl, and even though they are probably both married in their regular lives, they kind of have this weird, like, marital vibe when they're doing a radio show? 
[01:44:00]  No.  You're lucky enough that you don't have to do those shows?  Yeah, I got lucky.  All right.  I'm just trying to set up the bed.  Thanks for the help.  Oh, my fault.  I'm trying to get used to radio.  I had a sense that's what you were doing because I actually thought you cared for a minute, and I didn't realize that.  I was like, you know, yes, I am, by the way. 
[01:44:30]  I was just trying to start some chatter.  I could honestly, I could give a crap if you ever did it.  Chatter.  I really am an ass.  I'm sorry about that.  Go ahead.  Thanks for trying to bring me in.  That'll be the last time that happened.  So, Patrice, nothing.  All right.  Well, basically, this show is god-awful, okay?  What we did is we got a sample of what they're doing on their show today.  Today, Sam?  Yeah.  This is audio from Eric and Kathy's show today in Chicago.  And then what we do, Patrice, we take that same clip, and we do a little manipulating,  and we make them sound funnier and edgier. 
[01:45:00]  Okay.  We bring them into our world, the shock jock world.  All right.  So, here's audio of Eric and Kathy.  Yes, they are beating us in Chicago radio.  This is what they're doing today.  Eric and Kathy, my husband and I are on the verge of celebrating our one-year anniversary.  Oh, nice.  One year of marital bliss.  We never went on a real honeymoon and are trying to decide where to go and not spend a fortune.  I've heard all of you talk about the vacations you've taken in the past,  whether personal or work-related.  We were wondering, what did you guys like best? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, boy.  That's tough.  Mm-hmm.  Beach and sun and sand and surf.  That's what they're hoping for for their one-year anniversary.  I remember the Dominican Republic.  I don't know why that one sticks out.  Punta Cana?  Yeah.  Huh?  I really enjoyed that.  But the most recent trip that we took...  Puerto Vallarta.  Puerto Vallarta was good, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like Puerto Vallarta the best.  I think I'm a Puerto Vallarta guy, too.  I think I like Puerto Vallarta because it seemed more accessible and it seemed that you could 
[01:46:00]  go out and do more things.  Right.  The town of Puerto Vallarta is pretty cool.  Melissa's the only one that I know that can sleep while riding over more potholes than  God ever created.  I was not going to say that.  That's so true.  I did do that with the Dominican.  Right.  The Dominican trip.  On our way to Punta Cana.  Yeah.  Back to the airport.  Right.  I'm out.  Puerto Vallarta was good.  I liked Cancun way back when, but then the day after we left, it got blasted off the  map by the hurricane.  But now it's back.  They recovered.  Back and better than that. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  Listen.  Jesus Christ.  I got to be completely honest with everybody.  Those guys are great.  I tried.  And I tried to focus and really pay attention.  They lost me like somewhere in the middle of that clip.  I think the eighth time someone said Puerto Vallarta.  That was it for you?  That was annoying the crap out of me.  You guys.  You discussed.  You discussed.  See, Patrice enjoyed that.  We don't get it.  We don't get why shows like this are popular in other things.  With the whole.  Oh, that's hard. 
[01:47:00]  Were they talking about their vacation?  It's going to be mean and everything.  Yeah.  They're pleasant.  It does.  We're not mean all the time.  Only when people deserve it.  It's got to have some edge to it.  Some people need to know about like, you know what I mean?  A lot of times, right?  Oh, yeah.  Patrice.  You don't think it's amazing to drive up a pothole and just like not even notice.  You don't think it's amazing.  You don't think it's interesting.  It is amazing.  I'm just playing the part of the bitch on the show.  I know, but you don't need to.  Yeah.  Let's be serious for a minute.  You're right. 
[01:47:30]  Let's be serious.  We're.  I'll just agree with everything.  We bring it down.  I admit I'm in love.  Look, I love the listeners.  But you always have to add something.  I hate them.  No, you have to add something.  See, your niceness has to always be added with meanness.  It has to be I'm in love, but you, fat boy, you don't know what love is.  Oh, yeah.  It always has to be mixed.  It always has to be.  Backhanded compliments.  Yeah, it always has to be some type of Lucifer versus Michael kind of thing.  We always got to have the gamut.  Why can't you just talk about, hey, you know, it's cold out and not, whoa, it's cold in a 
[01:48:00]  something's breast, you know, or cold in a.  Because people are usually, wait, wait, that's a horrible, because most people are miserable  when it's cold out.  What are you trying to, you're supposed to try to make that happy?  But comment, comment in a nice way about what people are going through.  You know something?  I understand what Patrice is saying, because I hear that kind of sensitivity when they  all get together as comics and sit around at a table and talk to each other, because  all you hear is niceness and there's never any meanness. 
[01:48:30]  Where do you think guys get a lot of the fuel?  Look at the guys.  I'm just saying, you guys, man, that was very interesting.  It was friendly.  It was a turn from this, and I'm putting quote signs in the air.  Wait, wait.  This shock jock thing that you guys do.  You actually found that sit-throughable.  You would sit through that.  Are you kidding me?  Let me tell you, if people like that would let you on these shows.  Why would other people sit there?  You don't think I could, I'd rather sit there and have positivity going out in the universe 
[01:49:00]  than this constant pressure to be a foul human being.  You know something?  Let me tell you something.  This threesome fiasco I'm always trying, just because I think that's what's interesting.  But really, I kiss, and we hold, and we hug, and we sleep in really different full-size beds  like Mary Tyler Moore.  And you think those people are actually like that?  You think when the mics get shut off, you're going to sit around, and we're going to talk  about things and laugh with those people?  That's the phoniest? 
[01:49:30]  You might as well look at your toaster and listen to that, because you're getting nothing  out of a show like that.  That's phony garbage.  Hold on a second, because I don't want to lose this girl, and then we'll go back, or  is it a guy?  Oh, Brendan.  Brendan, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, no, I was calling about that whole we situation that you guys are doing, the we  for a we.  And I didn't think it was an original idea when they first did it, when someone died,  and now you guys are going to...  Well, first of all, we did it way before this contestant died doing it, and we just want 
[01:50:00]  to show the rest of the radio world that it can be done.  Now, I got a solid question for y'all.  What if someone does die?  Where do you guys go?  See, we know what to do in every situation.  Well, I think our past proves that we know what we're doing.  Oh, boy.  I wouldn't bring that up.  All right, Brendan.  We're doing the we for a we.  No one can stop it, as far as that goes.  All right, Patrice. 
[01:50:30]  Wait a minute.  You really got...  Kathy and Edgar, right?  It's Eric and Kathy.  Oh, see?  Couldn't even remember the name.  Eric and Kathy.  Eric and Kathy.  And I know you're not serious, so stop.  If they had a we.  Just...  Yeah.  If they had a we.  Yeah.  They wouldn't even make a...  They would just go, look.  Someone deserves a we, and they're going to give...  No one has to...  Yeah.  ...endangers their liver.  But that is boring.  Yeah, we're going to go to the children's hospital and give it away.  To all the whole floor.  You think that's wrong to give it to a ball child?  No.  No, it's not wrong. 
[01:51:00]  But it doesn't make for entertaining radio.  Yeah.  Do that in your regular life.  Go get a we right now and find some kid that has a little cancer action.  Send some money out to little kids.  I have no problem with that.  But when you're trying to entertain people, you need to keep it interesting.  You want people to react.  What kind of action?  Good, bad.  Huh?  What kind of action?  Eh, there's some kids around here.  The type is going to survive, so it's not a waste.  Was that too mean?  I guess.  All right.  So listen. 
[01:51:30]  We got Irk and Kathy.  Now we took that clip.  What were they talking about?  Vacations?  Who knows?  Um, wow.  They were talking about, holy Jesus, I can't even tell you.  One, two, three, four, five.  We have six, seven people in this room right now.  What were they talking about?  One person stepped up.  I know they started talking about places, vacation places, but I don't know if that  was because they were talking about vacations, because they were talking about bad vacations,  good vacations.  I can't tell you.  Vacations.  And I was, like, the sound was going in my ears at the time. 
[01:52:00]  Look, I know we have a listening problem on this show, but I sat there and was, like,  I was just closing my eyes and, like, squinting.  I was trying to concentrate as hard as I could, and they lost me.  Potholes?  Potholes.  I heard that.  Sleeping.  Puerto Vallarta?  Puerto Vallarta, 80 times, I heard.  Love and Honeymoons.  I started nodding off.  I was getting Forrest Whitaker eye.  I just started, like, one eye just started shutting.  King of Scotland eye.  King of Scotland eye.  I was just nodding off.  He was getting Idy Amin. 
[01:52:30]  Idy Amin.  Hey, hold on a minute.  The word's getting out there.  Let's go to Mike in East Northport.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, Mike.  Punch out, Maverick.  Punch out.  With what?  A wee for a wee.  If you guys F this up and I gotta go back to listening to freaking Scott and Todd in the  morning again, I'm gonna slit my freaking wrist.  I gotta tell you, man.  It's time to take some chances with this radio show.  We gotta prove to the radio community you can do the wee for a wee contest. 
[01:53:00]  And we listened to their broadcast.  It was online.  You saw what they did wrong.  Yeah.  We know.  We just know.  Please don't bring...  We're professionals.  We know how to do this.  Just look.  Oh, I don't know.  Just look at our past.  We're good at stuff.  Past record.  We're good at...  Get out of here, Mike.  Not necessarily indicative of future performance.  Don't blow up our spot.  We got a wee and we're giving it away.  Damn you.  Next week on the Opie and Anthony show.  A wee for a wee.  All right.  So we took the Eric and Kathy clip you just heard about 10 minutes ago and we threw a 
[01:53:30]  few bleeps in there and now it's funny.  Now it's worth listening to.  Now it's edgy.  Sam's feeling very confident about this, by the way.  Oh, okay.  Very confident, huh?  Going out on a high note.  All right.  All right.  Here you go now, Patrice.  This is them sounding interesting.  All right.  Well, we can only hope, but I don't think so.  He's gonna be around for a while.  Patrice, listen.  This is how you make it funny.  All right?  Eric and Kathy, my husband and I are on the verge of celebrating our one-year anniversary. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, nice.  One year of marital bliss.  We never went on a real honeymoon and are trying to decide where to go.  I've heard all of you talk about the vacations you've taken in the past, whether personal  or work-related.  We were wondering, what did you guys do best?  Oh, boy.  That's tough.  Beach and sun and...  That's what they're hoping for for their one-year anniversary.  I don't remember the Dominican Republic.  I don't know why that one sticks out.  I really enjoyed that, but the most recent **** was good, too. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like **** the best.  I think I'm a **** guy, too.  I think I like **** because it seemed more accessible, and it seemed that you could go out and do more things.  Right.  The **** is pretty cool.  Melissa is the only one that I know that can sleep while riding over more **** than God  ever created and can sound asleep.  I was just going to say that.  It's so true.  I did do that with the Dominicans.  I'm out.  Sam came in with confidence and hit it out of the park today. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, that's good.  What a filthy show they are.  See?  They like to get edgy there.  Oh, are they a dirty, dirty show?  A dirty, dirty show.  I feel like reporting them.  Yeah.  There's one on TV that's just like it.  Like a TV version of those guys.  See, now you're with us.  Yeah.  Well, the morning TV is filled with these couples, these fake couples.  My God.  Yeah.  How are they not just kicked off the air with that type of language?  How is it number one?  She's riding over all kinds of beef and Dominican beef. 
[01:55:30]  The best kind of beef.  The best kind of beef is that Dominican beef.  She's riding it.  There you go.  That is number one.  Well, I don't know if it's number one.  It's up there.  It's beating you guys in Chicago?  Oh, yeah.  It's beating us.  And unlike other shows, we have no problem admitting our status in these cities.  Yeah.  In Chicago, shows like that are beating us.  Why?  I don't know.  Well, they're edgier than us based on that last clip. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, yes.  If they did that every morning, I'd love to.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Joe in Astoria.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I definitely want to get into that contest.  What?  The we for a we?  You want to win a we?  Steve, there's a lot of interest already.  I've been trying to get one of those for like three months.  We've noticed that we've been losing our balls in the last few months, and we've got to kind of bring back that edge.  Joe, does it make you nervous that the last we for a we contest, there was a fatality? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  Me and my friends have had stupid contests like this before.  All right.  Yeah, I think that was a once-in-a-lifetime type of thing, and we're going to prove that by doing a we for a we on the Opie and Anthony show next week.  Oh, yeah.  That sounds perfect, guys.  All right.  All right.  You want to hang on?  Maybe get his info?  Yeah.  Oh, hell yes.  All right.  Hold on.  And we'll have plenty of water around, so don't you worry.  There's Joe in Astoria.  All right.  We've got to take a break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  You know what?  We never did the, and it's getting old fast here, the FCC complaints about the Super Bowl. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  The Super Bowl, obviously, was almost two months ago now, but these complaints just became available.  It's starting to roll in.  And they're pretty funny.  The one complaint, it ends with, thanks, CBS, for turning my son gay.  Can we read a few of these when we get back, hopefully?  Oh, man.  That sounds good.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're making a lot of people nervous out there, Ant. 
[01:57:30]  I see.  We've got bosses falling and everything.  Yeah.  We have to do this.  We have to show our balls.  We have to show the rest of the radio.  And you shouldn't be scared.  I think it's time.  I think it's time to push back a little bit.  We will do a We for We next week on the Opie and Anthony show, the famous contest.  That killed the listener. 
[01:58:00]  And we're sorry for her and her family, obviously, but we've got to show radio that you can do it the right way.  Yeah.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  So the Super Bowl, we teased that we were going to talk about this, and somebody on Instant Feedback,  guys, the Super Bowl was like a month and a half ago.  Yeah, we know.  Yeah.  But the complaints are now available to the public.  Yeah, the wheels of the government turn very slowly. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  So these are just starting to get out.  These are the complaints, actual complaints, that people wrote in to the FCC about the Super Bowl halftime show  and the commercials that aired during the Super Bowl.  Now, this also shows how little people know about what is allowed and what isn't allowed over the public airwaves.  And how great is it, too, that they think they got a handle on the halftime show after the Janet Jackson thing?  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  And they think they're covering all their bases and making sure nothing crazy will happen.  And there won't be chatter on Monday morning about that crazy thing that happened.  And there you have Prince pretty much playing a you-know-what, a phallic symbol.  Yeah, he used his guitar behind a silhouette screen.  You've got to think the executives at CBS and the NFL just lost their minds like,  Oh, my God, we didn't think of this.  This is going to be a problem.  He went behind a silhouette screen and used the neck of his guitar as he was playing it as if it was a sexual part of his body. 
[01:59:30]  And as he's going up and down the neck of the guitar playing his leads, it looked like he was doing stuff to himself.  So people actually wrote into the FCC to complain about that.  And then the other one was the Snickers commercial with the two mechanics in the garage that ended up kissing each other.  Well, the one guy was eating the Snickers bar and the other guy wanted a bite, but their hands were dirty from working on a car. 
[02:00:00]  So he went in to try to take a bite off the Snickers bar that was in the other guy's mouth.  In the other guy's mouth.  Got a little too close, and it turned into a homo kiss.  It turned into a kiss between two men.  Now, that's the one that really shows that people don't know what is allowed as far as the FCC goes and what isn't.  To complain about that, that's completely allowed to be on television.  There isn't anything the FCC can do to fine a company for putting that on the air. 
[02:00:30]  It's allowed.  Just because it's against your beliefs or your religion or anything like that doesn't mean you can't air it.  The FCC isn't the place to waste their time by writing complaints in about it.  Are some complaints just that commercial stunk?  I bet they get those, yeah.  What commercial just stunk?  Well, we'll fine the company for putting out stinky commercials.  Such awful material.  Let's get into the complaints.  So here's the first one from somebody. 
[02:01:00]  I don't know where their name is.  Oh, Jody.  No, no, that's the one this was assigned to.  It doesn't have the name of the person, I guess.  No, I think they're anonymous, of course.  Complaint summary.  This is what the person wrote in to the FCC.  It was obscene to show Prince a homosexual.  A homosexual.  I say it like that because homosexual is in capital letters.  Capitals, yeah, they don't like that.  A homosexual person threw a sheet as to show his silhouette while his guitar showed a very phallic symbol coming from his below midriff section. 
[02:01:30]  His guitar, by the way, is beyond strange looking to begin with.  I'm very offended, and I would prefer not to have showed it to my four children who love football.  One of them has hoped to be a quarterback, and now he will turn out gay.  Someone actually wrote that.  By the way, this isn't a comedy writer.  These are actual complaints.  We live among these people in America.  But don't you understand, that's why Susan and Phillip show, that's why it's number one. 
[02:02:00]  Because that's who's out there.  No one, like no one who's an ass writes.  Right.  Like we sit there and go, this stinks.  We don't write that stuff.  You don't write.  We don't know what knows.  And then to think just by watching that, your son's going to turn homosexual.  Yeah, and she finishes by saying, I am actually considering to check him for HIV.  Now you're sitting there going, there's no way some dummy wrote this.  No, she wrote this and sent it to the FCC.  This wasn't a goof email to her friends at the office. 
[02:02:30]  Thanks, CBS, for turning my son gay, gay in capital letters.  The next one.  Mrs. Nagel?  I find it.  I find the name.  I find it highly unacceptable to have a family watching a sporting event only to find Prince stroking,  manipulating, and fondling his guitar behind the curtain.  This image only made him look extremely large, which made the rest of us feel small  and unable to perform this evening.  Unable to perform.  Now that guy sounds a little goofy. 
[02:03:00]  I don't think so, though.  People are just dumb out there.  Can we acknowledge that?  Can we do me a big favor, please?  Just one thing.  Can we just add, when you say people, just add the word white.  Yeah, yeah.  That's another thing.  I would love to disagree with you, Patrice, but you're kind of right.  If you profile these letters and stuff, it's definitely white people.  Just white people.  Fair is fair.  The shwoogie gets a bad rep on this show, but we've got to call it. 
[02:03:30]  If it was somebody black or something, this is just white.  You got him.  All right, here's one about the Snickers commercial.  Actual summary to the FCC.  Actual complaint summary to the FCC.  The Snickers bar commercial promoting homosexual behavior was disgraceful.  Also, the giant shadow phallus from Prince's guitar was equally disgraceful.  This behavior has no place in a primetime major family event.  It was easier explaining to the kids about Jackson's boob being exposed  than explaining the pro-homosexual theme of this year's event. 
[02:04:00]  We will never watch live again, only on TiVo, with the halftime filth show cut out.  It's pathetic when you can't keep porn out of the Super Bowl  just because 6% of the population is gay.  Jeez.  These people are, well, these white people.  Exactly.  I thought I saw Peyton Manning's panties showing through his hip guard.  I saw a bulge.  I just can't take it anymore. 
[02:04:30]  Just, oh, your people.  All right, here's another one.  This is the Snickers commercial again.  This is a commercial during Super Bowl.  It was a candy bar commercial that showed two guys kissing.  My husband was in the kitchen when our son said,  What the F?  My husband rushed in to see the men kissing.  This violates our religious beliefs and exposes our children to obscene and disgusting material.  They are taught are wrong.  I want something done about this.  Where'd your kid learn what the F?  Well, I...  What other mistakes? 
[02:05:00]  When your kid was watching the adult program by himself, at what point did he learn how to say what the F?  You know what's sad about this?  These people started all this and they got rid of the Snickers commercial.  They bailed.  They bailed on the whole commercial.  But you see, especially that letter.  It says,  This violates our religious beliefs and exposes our children to obscene and disgusting material they have taught are wrong.  That wasn't obscene.  It wasn't obscene in where the FCC can do anything about it. 
[02:05:30]  They actually wrote to the FCC about this with no knowledge of what the hell the FCC is supposed to do.  So, just idiots.  They should have a company that you write when you like stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Something where you only can write positive stuff.  You can read.  Oh, no.  I got the Snickers commercial.  I understood the context of it.  It was good.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the next complaint.  I was shocked to see the Snickers commercial on television last night.  Two individuals, men, engaged in a very central sexual scene. 
[02:06:00]  Obviously, so caught up in the heat of the moment that they forgot they were men and it was inappropriate to be acting in such a way.  I realize the Super Bowl ads are a big thing in advertising, but who monitors the content?  I was disgusted and shocked.  My two kids, 8 and 10, were also watching and they were shocked.  Were they?  Does paying a lot of money for these coveted time slots give companies free reign to air whatever they like?  Come on, folks.  It's 7 on a Sunday night Super Bowl. 
[02:06:30]  So?  It was a goof commercial.  God, people are so uptight about things.  Could you stop with the people?  White people are so uptight about this.  What is the deal when, like, because we talked about it earlier about a porno, when you're watching a porno and it's a gay porno and the guys start, like, kissing.  You go like, oh, because it's so, it's just against anything that a hetero guy could sit there and watch comfortably. 
[02:07:00]  It's very uncomfortable.  But that was like a goofy commercial thing.  It wasn't gay porno.  It shouldn't upset people to the point where, and I'm sure your kids, 8 and 10, were probably laughing at it.  You know, I don't think they were shocked.  It's like the Janet Jackson thing.  The kids, I had kids in the room.  They didn't see it.  It flashed by so quickly. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  And then the news played it 8,000 times, and that's probably where they saw it.  Yeah, the news showed everybody.  Well, black boob, white people.  White people get very upset at this kind of thing.  Oh, y'all.  I would love to know how many black people write in complaints to the FCC.  Not even a drop.  Oh, not a one.  Yeah, I'm with you, Patrice.  We complain outwardly.  Yeah.  Oh, you guys get uppity.  Trust me.  When it comes to actually writing.  You don't know about it.  We ain't going to hear nobody.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't believe anybody really is going to read it, but we know people are going to hear it. 
[02:08:00]  Unlike Dice, you do it face to face.  But I'll tell you what you guys do.  Oh, boy.  We're not covert.  You know how to march.  You people can march.  I'll tell you that.  You might not know how to write, but you guys know how to march.  You can march.  White people are most covert in the corner.  Dear, I don't like.  And then they go out and they're like, hi, homosexual that I'm not uncomfortable with.  I can't disagree with that.  Hi, black person.  Hi, Mexican person.  Phony baloney. 
[02:08:30]  All right, here we go.  One more complaint here.  The Indecent Material is part of a Snickers commercial in which an adult male working on a car  places a Snickers bar in his mouth.  He then, using the Snickers bar in his mouth, simulates an erection next to the face of his male co-worker.  The other male eats the bar from the opposite end while both men are making all sorts of noises.  They ultimately make lip contact.  This material exceeds indecency, and it's obscene.  Well, that person sure read into that a little deeper than it was meant to. 
[02:09:00]  Dear Caucasian.  Did I say Caucasian?  Dear white person.  Before this is over, can I please say something?  Yeah.  Danny has a bump on his head.  He looks like a Sinbad villain.  Like, it's the biggest bump I've ever seen.  What happened?  It's disturbing.  What happened?  I don't know.  I broke out kind of bad.  Aw.  I have like eight of them.  You look like Vladimir Klitschko punching him.  It's one of those.  Thanks for bringing that up, Eddie K.  It's one of those alcoholic zits that pop up. 
[02:09:30]  Danny!  I used to call that one.  I used to call those the Cyclops.  Yeah.  When you get one like that.  He's sweating booze and, you know.  Oh my God, Danny!  He's sweating booze and this is what happened.  Oh, what a bastard.  It's distracting.  He's got a third eye in the middle of his forehead.  Oh, he's walking out.  There's a boxing glove on his forehead.  It takes a lot for him to walk out, too.  Why don't you just go spin around on a rock by the ocean? 
[02:10:00]  Keep the ships from running into you.  You know what?  I'm going to write the FCC about Danny's face.  Oh, he just put on a hat.  Thank God.  He just put on a winter hat.  Thank God.  I shouldn't have to look at that bump while I'm listening to the FCC complaints.  Well, poor Danny.  We got more, but you get the point there, I'm sure.  Hey, this was a lot of fun today, Patrice.  Thank you so much.  No problem, white guy. 
[02:10:30]  Shut up.  Everybody's white today.  Yeah.  That was a very white segment.  Let's not forget, Jimmy's at the Improv in Pittsburgh all weekend long.  He'll be back, I think, Tuesday.  Okay, Patrice is going over to XM with us, and tomorrow night he does his own show on XM.  Yeah, Black Phillip, man.  Yep.  9 p.m. to 12.  Very, very cool.  Where I can discuss threesomes and other things and problems.  And love.  For two hours.  It's a helpful show, man.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people get help in their relationship.  Maybe we'll see you guys in Huntington this Sunday at the Bro's Restaurant there.  And don't forget, next week, a we for a we on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:11:00]  That's right.  You're hearing us correctly.  We'll have more details on that.  Guys, have a great weekend.  We greatly appreciate the support.  And if you're not joining us over at XM, I guess we'll see you Monday.  We'll see you next week. 
[02:11:30]  Friggin' Prop.  For more info, visit eatobullet.com.  We'll see you next week. 
[02:12:00]  We'll see you next week. 
[02:12:30]  We'll see you next week.

[02:13:30]  We'll see you next week. 
[02:14:00]  We'll see you next week. 
[02:14:30]  We'll see you next week. 
[02:15:00]  Master Pope grabbed me on the way into XM.  And he said, ask Patrice about maybe. 
[02:15:30]  I guess you got this whole thing on the word maybe that had him cracking up as he was walking  you to free FM this morning.  Yeah.  Patrice was like, yeah.  Was it what you were sort of telling us?  Yeah.  You were just starting to say, you were just starting to get into it and then we came back.  It was the same thing.  I don't want to overkill.  It's not overkill.  No one heard it.  Oh.  You only see, that's the weird thing about doing this radio show.  Well, the pap talkers probably heard it.  Yeah.  We continue with just babbling while the commercials are playing and I hate to admit it. 
[02:16:00]  Sometimes that stuff is way funnier than the stuff that makes the show.  And then you think you did it for everybody and then you realize, wait a minute, that was just for like five people.  No, I'm just saying how it's a little tougher.  It's a little tougher to have a girlfriend that loves you than it is to have five hoes that it's just easy to tell them stuff.  You know, it's like, you know, if a girl, I tell my girl, I don't want you to come over to my house, immediately there's a why.  There's a how come.  She feels that. 
[02:16:30]  But back in hoes days, you know, a hoes life is maybe or possible or could be.  I don't know.  We'll see.  You know, can I come over later maybe?  I don't think so.  And if I change my mind, I'll let you know.  And it's always okay because they always self-edit themselves.  You know what I mean?  They know their place.  They know their place.  They just self-edit.  But you said they live in a world of maybe.  They live in a world of maybe.  And I thought that was kind of brilliant.  Yeah.  They live in a maybe world.  Because you can't tell your girl maybe. 
[02:17:00]  Well, the expectations is maybe it'll happen.  Maybe or maybe not.  But if it doesn't, they understand because they live in the world of maybe.  Can I get a pair of shoes?  Maybe.  And it's really a maybe if I feel like it.  But if your girl asks the same question, you're like, you can go maybe, but it's always like she feels right now.  And this is the thing is like, because I'm not, you can't be in love and be a pimp.  You know? 
[02:17:30]  So thank you, man.  If you love your fucking girl, man, it's hard to be mean.  Like she'll say, like she live in a house that if she plugs in the fan and the blow dry at the same time, it feels a blow.  It's just a weird thing.  So, you know, a hoe, you go, well, good luck to you.  And she wouldn't like, a hoe wouldn't even tell you that story.  Like, because you go, well, why don't you dry your hair with the fan, bitch?  And forget about the hair dryer.  Fan yourself with the hair dryer. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, you better do something.  One or the other.  But when your girl goes, you know.  It's almost like you go, ah, that sucks.  That sucks to be you.  What can I tell you?  Yeah, hey, good luck to you and good luck to everything you're doing.  Why are you even telling me this?  Yeah, like a hoe knows not to tell you her problems.  Hey, if I do this, then I can't do that.  You go, good luck to you.  Now, it's like, for some reason, my girl, she's trying to ultimatum me.  And, you know, I don't want to lose her.  The loss is great.  But it's like I have to be almost colder than I was when she wasn't my girl. 
[02:18:30]  I have to be colder.  I have to be meaner.  I have to be, like, because I sit there and she's telling me a sad story about why her, you know, what am I going to do?  Like, okay, I bought the house.  She comes over anytime she wants to, right?  And I'm on my period.  And men have period.  And I know that I have a period.  I think I have the same symptoms when I want to, like, get some side pussy as she does when she's on her period.  I get cramps.  I get bloated. 
[02:19:00]  Get irritable.  Like, it's not the same for you.  But that house you live in, if I had a girl, if I was in your house and in my situation, in your situation,  I would have periods every month because I would walk around this mansion and I would go, boy, I should be having five naked bitches running around this motherfucker.  But I just, I'm faithful.  So when she's, like, when she's gone and she's not there sometimes, I sit and I just go, fuck, I could have two bitches here right now just doing things, being, you know, two goofy bitches, too. 
[02:19:30]  Like, you know, about 23 and it's like, yeah, that's crap molding, ho.  And she's like, wow, a refrigerator with ice.  You ever go to somebody that had an ice refrigerator but it doesn't work?  My ice actually comes out.  You can get, I don't need spring water because I have to filter, you know, the actual refrigerator water, ice shit works.  So it's like, but no other bitch has seen it yet because I'm being a decent human being. 
[02:20:00]  But it's like she's going to me like this.  And this is where I go, in my stomach, when hoes, you can go, and what's that got to do with me?  So she goes, she's telling me, it's like, what do I do?  Like, okay, I don't like my apartment.  I want to move out of my apartment, right?  And I want to leave.  But what do I do?  You don't want me to move in with you.  So do I get another apartment or do I move in here? 
[02:20:30]  So she's kind of giving me this ultimatum.  I think it was kind of like checking you out a little.  To see what I'm going to say.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I don't want to be cold and say, look.  But then I start, you got to think 10 years ahead or whatever you got to think as a man.  And you got to look up in the sky and envision, hold up.  If I say yes to this and I'm not ready for it, it's not going to be good.  I want her to have her own place because every month she gets bad PMS. 
[02:21:00]  And she's a cunt when she's on her PMS.  Like, she's unreasonable cunt.  And she's not that great to look at.  You know, she get the bumps and she just gets bloated.  And she makes me sick.  So I want her to leave my house.  I don't want to be around her.  Sometimes I just don't want to be around.  I want to be doing things.  I don't want you around.  So, you know, but I can't say, bitch, take a hike.  I can't be mean like I can back in whole days. 
[02:21:30]  Five, six girls is like, hey, bitch, what you want from me?  I can't get over.  I don't have a car.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Maybe I'll pick you up.  Maybe I won't.  Hey, listen, if you come by, it's possible I can drive you back home.  Not a guarantee.  You know?  The world of baby.  But when you're now in love, man, she's in love.  And it's like, that's what I'm saying.  And I love her.  It's very difficult to be hardcore.  But I have to be harder now that I love her than I was before. 
[02:22:00]  Because now, you know, she's self-edited.  How long have you been together now?  She's been with me.  A few years now, bro.  Five years.  She's, you know, she is, I've been with her, I'm telling you, I've been with her too.  She's been with me five.  She's now engaged.  She's now engaged.  And I'm just now getting into having a girlfriend.  Right, right.  She considers herself engaged to you.  But I tell her.  Even though officially you're not.  And you're just, and you're in the getting to know her stage. 
[02:22:30]  But listen to this, though.  This is very fair.  This is very fair, I think, Opie.  I tell her, listen, whatever you feel about me, right, just feel it.  If you feel like you're engaged to me, I'm not going to make you feel dumb for being engaged.  I'm not going to make you feel stupid for being, feeling like you want to be married to me.  Does she buy her own ring and everything?  I bought her a ring.  And I said, this ring is whatever you want it to be.  Oh my.  You can't commit.  You're nuts. 
[02:23:00]  I can't sit here and take this anymore.  Are you married?  You're not willing.  Are you married?  Hold on.  No, but you gave her an engagement ring.  No, I gave her.  But you don't want to make that.  I like you enough to give you a ring now, bitch.  What kind of ring is it?  Oh, it's a nice one.  Diamonds?  Yeah.  Looks like an engagement ring?  It's bad, motherfucker.  See, you can't commit.  And a matter of fact, I told her, wear it on your pointed finger.  I said, wear it on the finger you point with.  And she put it on her I'm married finger. 
[02:23:30]  But I'm not going to tell her.  If she wants to say, this is my fiancee, I say it's cool.  Wow, but you can't commit to the point to yourself to admit that.  You gave her an engagement ring, but you can't say, look.  No, I gave her, when I'm walking with my girl, this, I like her flashing.  I like my girl to have a nice, I like her to be with the Joneses.  I like her to feel like she has a phone that she can pull out with other bitches,  hands that are pretty like other bitches. 
[02:24:00]  It's an ego thing, even though it's for her.  It's an ego thing, too.  I want her to look nice.  But the engagement ring is pretty important to the women out there.  You could have done the same thing by getting her some big, you know, diamond earrings.  No, but I like to see her hand flashy.  I like for her, like, say she's around some other bitch talking about what their life is like.  Patrice, admit it.  Hold on, admit it.  I can't let you do it.  Go ahead, man.  You got engaged.  I'm not engaged.  I can see Patrice standing in front of, like, a minister in a tux with a bride next to him, 
[02:24:30]  just going, I'm not getting married.  It's like, I'm not getting married.  I do.  I'm not getting married.  He whispers to her, look, this is whatever you want it to be.  She thinks we're getting married.  I'm here because the food looks great.  She tells me to this day, she gets upset.  She gets, see, this is what I'm saying.  I'm sharing a lot of this shit.  This is my personal life.  She gets upset when, like, she asks me, why are we together?  Because we're very open about our past relationships.  And she, I mean, so I gotta, I gotta fucking be gangster. 
[02:25:00]  Because she popped a couple of guys I know.  When you know.  You gotta be gangster.  Not personally, but just of, no of.  Yeah.  And I had to be like, I had to bite my face.  Not just my lip.  Bite.  I had to bite my face.  Like, I'm just sitting there going, motherfucker, who?  And I had to fucking just deal with that.  So, you know, so I tell her, my shit, my shit was when we were together,  like I, like I was like, I call it karate class, you know? 
[02:25:30]  And when we were together, she was a friend.  And I was full, I had full-fledged karate class.  I had at least five, six students.  She used to look out through the window and go, I want to join this class.  She joined the class, but she was very low on the totem pole.  You know, she was very low in terms of where she was.  And she always asked, well, why are we together now?  I go, you hung in there.  You fucking hung in there.  Women, I never leave women.  They leave me. 
[02:26:00]  And I get women who, like, she goes, well, I was this stupid bitch that stayed in.  I said, no, you were the girl that had the skills to be the other chick.  Like, if you date a doctor and you treat her like a whore, eventually she's going to go,  I got to get something out of being a whore.  I am not a, you can't just fuck me in the mouth and just expect me.  I'm a doctor.  I'm a lawyer.  I'm a teacher.  I can't.  Dude.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  It's turning today.  I mean, you've been everyone's hero for a really long time of a relationship.  Go ahead, man.  But Patrice is full of shit.  Go ahead.  Wow.  You're engaged.  I'm not engaged.  Just because I bought a ring, that's absolutely not.  You're having a tough time committing in general.  I'm not even talking about relationships, just in general in your life.  Committing to stuff?  No, absolutely not, man.  All right.  I don't second guess myself.  I gave, put it, put it this way.  When I gave her the ring, I had to explain to her, this is not an engagement ring from me.  This was a, this is a ring because I fucking want to buy you something nice. 
[02:27:00]  So why not get a ring that doesn't look like an engagement ring?  It sounds like you got a ring that anyone else would go, wow,  that's an engagement ring.  Fucks yeah.  So there's other types of rings out there you could get that don't look like, uh.  Let me give you an example, okay?  Say Anthony's house.  Do you not, and your, your woman's friends, the fact that you love your girl, right?  Yeah.  You don't, don't you enjoy the fact that if your girl brought her friends over your house  and she feels it's her house and you don't mind her feeling like it's her house, even 
[02:27:30]  though it's your house, but you, the pride as she walks around and goes, come on ladies.  And she goes, bam, this is the life I'm leading.  Right.  This is how this man's treating me.  It makes you look good.  Yeah.  That's no, uh, that's nothing odd.  So I buy her very nice shit because it makes her look good, but it makes me look good for  anybody that fucking questions her.  If I like her to be able to walk around and, and go, my shit is up to par with any of you  motherfuckers. 
[02:28:00]  I like that.  It wasn't an engagement ring, even though she feels like she's engaged to me.  It's whatever you want it to be.  Yes.  You think I'm fucking joking?  That's like, I want to, I want to tell you that we're gay, but I'm not brave enough to  say it.  We argue about it.  She goes, you make me feel like this and that because you, you make, like she got mad  because I brought another chick a puppy.  Hold on.  They're, they're, they're chomping at the bit here.  It's Craig and Jersey.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, Patrice.  Listen, Patrice, you're out your fucking mind. 
[02:28:30]  First of all, it's a diamond ring.  It's a diamond ring that fits on her engagement finger.  Tell her to the judge.  Let's do what he says.  Well, look, and I can't help it that I didn't have it sized either.  I can't help it that the ring I bought fit that fucking finger.  That's all it's for bullshit.  Fucking Cundellar.  I'm not, I'm not fucking.  Oh, damn.  I thought it would only fit the thumb.  There's how many fingers, one bitch wears a finger, one bitch wears a ring on her middle  finger.  It's just, it's either you got two finger wear on your, your, your right hand or your left 
[02:29:00]  hand.  I said, sweetie, do what you, I told her I'll never make you feel stupid when you say how  you feel.  When you gave her that choice, how fast did it go on the wedding ring finger?  It went on that finger.  Like, like not even a thought.  If you ask my girl what's going on, right?  If you ask my girl what's going on, she knows I love her, right?  But there's, there's a title thing that women want.  They can't help it. 
[02:29:30]  So we, we elevated to a certain level and look it, I'm just now, I just became a man.  I bought a house.  I can't fucking like, but I'm saying I can't share my fucking a year ago.  It's been a while.  I've been a roommate and live with my mama.  I still call my mother sometimes to act like I'm seeing how she's doing, but I need that  motherly, it's okay, you're not a loser, son.  So I just, I'm not ready. 
[02:30:00]  All right, listen, we got to let some of these people in.  Bill in Maryland.  What's up, Bill?  Patrice, you know, I've always been with you on most stuff of your relationships, but  man, I really, really think you're so full of shit.  I think Patrice, you got down on one knee and I think you're just in denial, man.  Come on, you put it on her pointer finger.  Are you kidding me?  Come on, man.  First of all, you guys are into symbols and shit like that, man.  That dumb symbol.  Oh, yeah.  Really, really.  Have you ever had a, let me ask you a question. 
[02:30:30]  Have you ever had a woman pressure you to get married?  Yes.  Okay.  Did you get married?  No, I did not.  All right.  But you, you had her pressure you, right?  You had her give you that quiet ultimatum.  You had her say, this is what she built to a place where you weren't at yet.  What I'm saying is I don't want to crush her dreams that maybe that I might not get to  that place, but I'm saying this ring is, is really what it's represents the same thing  the watch does.  You have to eliminate your idea of what this, are you kidding me? 
[02:31:00]  It's not, but, but it's my, it would be my fault if I did not tell, like, I don't lie.  I did not, I told her, and she will fucking tell you this because she hates the fact that  I said, sweetie, this ain't, wherever you put it, you can put it on the left, you can  put it on, but it ain't what you want it to be.  Where are you?  You're off the hook, man.  You're off the hook.  I'm not lying to you, dude.  A lot of people just point out, like, you gotta, you gotta cancel Black Phillip.  It's over. 
[02:31:30]  We had his run, but it's over.  I'll tell you what, Scandal rocks the Black Phillip show.  You know what's funny?  She's gonna be, she's actually off work, she's coming down Saturday, shoot the, and call  you, and ask her, man.  It's not bullshit, but I do, she's a little more.  Make sure she's on the air.  Make sure she's on the air.  Oh, she's there, dude.  Don't even worry about it.  Tomorrow night is gonna be a really good show with Patrice.  She's there.  On 202.  And she's not gonna lie.  Where are you going for your, this is not a honeymoon, by the way.  Have you guys decided? 
[02:32:00]  We went to Brazil together.  But I mean, like, where are you going?  Let me tell you something.  Where she's gonna be like, oh, this is.  For me?  For me?  This bitch got my keys to my house.  She could come.  This is what I'm saying.  I'm not trying to be gangster.  I'll tell you where I am.  I'm far enough to give a chick keys to my house.  And she walks in, comes in anytime she fucking feels like it.  And I don't have no side pussy at my house.  There's no woman that knows.  A lot of women know what my roommate days were, what they can describe my career. 
[02:32:30]  They can't describe my home.  She has a key to my home.  But that is a big fucking deal to me.  That is like marriage to me.  Like, here's the thing.  That's being married.  I bought other girls puppies.  She hates that.  She hates the fact that I bought other girls.  You brought another girl a ring?  Yeah.  But who gives a fuck?  You know what I'm saying?  It's just, look, enjoy the niceness of the fucking ring.  I did not.  Will you marry?  Fuck that.  I gave her a key to my house. 
[02:33:00]  That's a big deal.  Buying her a ring so that she looks good is not a big deal.  That's symbol shit, man.  That's symbols.  Something's going on with you today.  Because you keep bringing the relationship thing up today.  It's been an ongoing theme.  Well, you know why?  I'm on my period.  I'm not bullshitting.  I'm on my period.  I think Anthony's angle is hilarious, though.  You guys are going to be in a wedding ceremony.  You're going to be the whole time going, look.  This is for her.  Whatever she thinks it is.  This is whatever you want it to be, baby. 
[02:33:30]  I'm just here for the steak.  We're going to go on the...  But that's what I was saying to you.  This is going to be whatever you want it to be.  Vacation.  You know, the kids.  All that is whatever she wants it to be.  It's traditional, man.  We're not traditional.  Everybody gets caught up in the tradition of everything, man.  Well, tomorrow's going to be interesting.  You can discuss this some more.  I mean, the people are going nuts.  But stay tuned for tomorrow.  Yeah, tell them to call.  They'll be here.  They'll be here.  Call tomorrow.  It's going to be a really good show.  And I'm not going to see your director.  You ask her any question you fucking want to.  Hey, that's good.  I think we're going to get some numbers tomorrow. 
[02:34:00]  I think a lot of people are going to be checking out your show.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, moving into some other things.  Cleaning up some of the other unbelievable stories of the week.  Saw this story, and it made me laugh, because Ann and I talk about this a lot.  We've talked about this a lot over the years.  We talk about strip clubs there, Patrice, you know?  Why?  Oh, I think you've been on these discussions, too.  Where, like, during the day, you don't get the...  Well, I was talking about when you was flying the red eye.  That's when I came up.  Yeah, but you don't get...  Gay strippers.  The day strippers are not the girls that are in the major leagues. 
[02:34:30]  No.  They're working their way up.  That's why they're stripping during the day.  Or on the downslide.  Or on the down...  Yeah, on the downslide there.  And this story is funny, because it proves our theory that these day strippers just don't  make enough money, because they're not as pretty.  They got something else going on.  And so, you got these strippers that rob the bank.  Yeah, bank robbing Barbie bandits.  They're not Barbie bandits if they're robbing a bank. 
[02:35:00]  If they were Barbies, they would be making tons of money.  They would have to rob a bank.  One was, like, all right, I guess.  Oh, you saw the picture?  In her mug shot, she looked pretty skanked up.  Yeah.  But you could tell, like, maybe cleaned up and with some sleep or something.  But the other one was a complete mess.  And, yeah, they're bank robbers.  Apparently not good ones.  Parents of an alleged teenage bank robbing duo sit on national television this week. 
[02:35:30]  They couldn't comprehend how their daughters could have, as police and surveillance tape  suggest, giggled behind fashionable sunglasses as they robbed the Bank of America branch last  week.  Teen bank robbers.  Yeah, they're day strippers.  Those are day strippers.  Yeah, day stripper.  Yeah, I got the pictures now, too.  Yeah, those are, like, that's the poster you would see if they had a day stripper poster.  We'll just take plays, though, because they might be night strippers.  Georgia.  Atlanta.  No, Atlanta's got strip clubs all over the place. 
[02:36:00]  And they're white girls?  They're not just day strippers.  They strip on the bus.  They strip in taxi cabs in the front seat.  In Atlanta, that's strip central.  Well, they're shocked at Shooter Alley, a new dance club outside Atlanta, where co-workers  say Ashley and Heather, both 19, work the afternoon shift.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never would have thought it ever, said 26-year-old dancer Dream, who says she works 
[02:36:30]  with Miller.  Her stage name, Adrienne.  Ugh.  She can't even get the...  Adrienne, I don't know what the...  She can't even get the stripper name right.  And Johnston goes by the name of Charlie.  Hey, Charlie, come over here and give me a dance, Charlie.  I need a lap dance from Charlie.  For at least two months, I guess.  Yeah.  They've been working there.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, come on to the stage. 
[02:37:00]  Make way and give a big hand.  Here comes Charlie.  Doesn't quite have that.  What, all the car names were taken?  That's right.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to put your hands together.  Make sure you tip your waitress.  And give a big hand right now, making her way to the stage.  Former mechanic.  Here comes Dan. 
[02:37:30]  You might have seen her during the Super Bowl.  She did the Snickers part commercial.  Part of the, yeah, the Snickers commercial.  Now making her way to the stage.  Give it up for the lovely Travis.  Hey, girl.  Where is it?  Charlie.  Here comes Sanjay.  Or Sanjay.  Whatever his name is.  Isn't he pretty?  Let the healing begin.  They call it Chuck.  Hey, Chuck.  They call it Chuck with joy. 
[02:38:00]  Throw her a book, Chuck.  Making her way to the stage.  Yeah, daytime stripper is not good.  Very low on the totem pole there as far as strippers go.  Yeah, we used to.  To the point you got to rob banks because you're not making the same money as the girls at night.  We used to do that on the job all the time for lunch.  You'd take your little lunch break at the strip club and they would always just be a mess in there.  Dance around in Ronkonkoma at Bird's Place or somewhere like that.  And they were the ones with the C-section scars and the bullet wounds.  My first strip club experience was horrific. 
[02:38:30]  It was that place Danny's Den on Long Island.  It's now a supermarket parking lot.  And we went in there with fake IDs.  I don't think I was more than 17, I guess.  Yeah.  And, yeah, like you described, I didn't even know what a cesarean scar was yet.  That's how young I was.  What happened to her?  You went to a C-section scar?  Fucking strip club?  Dude, it was a place called Danny's Den.  It was a shithole to the point they made a parking lot. 
[02:39:00]  And she had a bullet wound.  I saw the bullet wound.  I'm like, that looks like a bullet wound.  The other stuff going on, I'm like, what the fuck?  This is what strip clubs is all about.  Long Island strip clubs during the day, and even at night, some of them, oof.  But during the day, some of the worst strippers you'd ever see.  Big, nasty, like, feet.  They're trying to, like, walk on their heels.  And half the time, they're just all either hungover from the night before or just trying to get drunk for that day.  So they would barely dance. 
[02:39:30]  They just kind of would shuffle from one foot to another in front of you.  So you like hot strippers?  No, I'd rather have a girl that just looks like a normal, like, natural girl.  Natural girls.  That's, like, naked and looks hot.  Do you have any unusual turn-on other than your actual...  Look, man, you got enough out of me today.  Stop.  I'm just saying, you got an unusual turn-on.  Like, is that a secret?  Is this, like, an interview for our double date? 
[02:40:00]  No.  All right.  I'm just asking, like...  Don't fight back.  You look weird right now.  Because I do like filthy strippers.  You like the filthy stripper?  The plastic-looking strippers with the fake boobs?  No, I'm saying, I like...  Like, that's why I asked you.  If you like the sexy strippers, like, is there any other...  I like...  Natural.  A mess.  Like, when I saw Britney Spears, that C-section scar, that just...  Yeah, you like that shit.  It's not that kind of shit to me.  I thought you meant the fake boobs and everything is fake on the girl.  That's why I asked you. 
[02:40:30]  I like...  You're talking about the sloppiness.  I like a day stripper type of broad.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  I love those clubs, then.  You know, I just like that type of look.  Oh, are they a disaster.  That would be a funny website.  Day strippers.  Day strippers.  Picture after picture of day strippers.  And they're the ones that, like, the jukebox is playing and a song comes on they don't like,  so they have to take their shirt that they had on, put it over their boobs, and go,  Could you eject this one?  Bobby, could you eject it? 
[02:41:00]  And they're yelling at the bartender.  He's like, all right, right.  And he ejects it.  And then she's got to wait until the song starts.  And then she takes the shirt off of our tits and starts dancing.  She's back working.  Like, she becomes modest for a second and covers her titties.  Right.  Reading from Wackbag.  Coming down the spiral staircase, here's Gertrude.  Gertrude, everybody.  Yeah, you'll love Gertie.  Let's say hi to Alex in Red Bank, New Jersey.  Alex, what's up?  Nothing, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I was at a strip club the other day for lunch.  A strip club?  A strip club, yeah. 
[02:41:30]  I sound like a shit club.  No, but I saw this chick.  She's about 160 pounds and had the McDonald's arches tattooed on her thigh.  It was rather amazing.  What the fuck is that about?  Was it during the day?  Yeah.  There you go.  And there was another stripper who was 19.  She had started three days earlier, and the whole right side of her body was purple from  falling off the pole.  It was fucking disgusting.  Yeah, they just bandage you.  Give you a bandage until you get back on that stage. 
[02:42:00]  It is.  You know what's funny about dishonesty?  That guy goes, I was going to strip club for lunch the other day.  He didn't sound like this was new.  This was an event.  This is what he does.  Those strippers are what's there.  Yeah.  So he added, oh, blue.  Disgusting.  He knew what he was getting into.  But that's what he fucking likes.  Yeah.  He's going.  But he couldn't go all the way with the honesty and go, I fucking, I did enjoy that purple,  half a purple body.  Oh, something like that would be great to look at, just as a novelty. 
[02:42:30]  I did enjoy Grimace.  Sleeping on her side.  I did enjoy Grimace and the McDonald's theme.  I do enjoy the McDonald's theme there.  That's good.  Another girl got a plush in the eye.  She looked like the Hamburglar.  The other one looked like Grimace.  The other one got the arches.  I'm not saying.  I went to these day strip clubs for years.  It was something we always did on a Friday after work, or after lunch, actually.  We'd all just get in the truck and go to one of the strip clubs. 
[02:43:00]  It was great.  You'd just sit there bullshitting, looking at naked broads, no matter if they were messes  or hot.  You'd look at a mess dancing on stage, and then you'd be ready to leave, and you'd see  one of the strippers come in the door with her bag and her coat and stuff, and she's  walking back.  The A-team and shit.  And you look and go, all right, now I've got to maybe hang out a little longer and see  what's going on with her.  You can tell what time it is by the...  Yeah, the shift change.  The calling of the girl coming in and changing the door. 
[02:43:30]  Changing of the slut.  Oh, shit, she's gorgeous.  It must be five.  I've got to get out of here.  And then you've got to wait.  It's like, oh, fuck, it's midnight already?  And then you look at her for a little while, and yeah, it was like, it's just what we did.  Yeah.  Oh, that's really good.  And yeah, to be honest, yeah, you didn't care if there were messes or anything.  What did strippers look like back in the early 70s?  Oh, boy, big muffs and just like tits and big beehive hairdos.  70s. 
[02:44:00]  Rooster in Illinois.  Rooster.  Me and my brother went to the strip club, and the girl that came out dancing, she had  to be about 300 pounds, and she was eight months pregnant.  She looked like she was going to drop that thing any minute.  And you know how they come down there and try to lure you into buying drinks afterwards?  You know, after they get done, their dance will come down and sit with you.  Well, this skinny broad sits with me, and then this fat chick, she comes and sits with my  brother. 
[02:44:30]  And the waiter comes over, and he's like, would you like to buy the lady a drink?  And he says, no.  She goes, I'm drinking for two.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, no shit.  All right, Rooster, thank you.  All right, bye.  Bye-bye.  I never fall for that buy the fucking dance or a drink shit.  I'm from the old school, like we were just talking about, the old Long Island clubs where,  you know, you'd buy your beer for five bucks back then, which, you know, beers were going 
[02:45:00]  for like a dollar at a regular bar.  And you'd buy your beer, well overpriced, and then you'd have like some singles.  Because you don't have money.  And then if a girl comes by, and when she's walking on the bar or something, you throw  her a single, and she'd feel like squat in front of you and shake her tits and do whatever  she does, and then she'd be off.  It's not this, hey, give me $20 so I can dance in front of you, and then fucking come  over and try to shake you down for a drink that cost another $20.  Yeah, but what sucked about what you just explained back in the day, so you're, you're 
[02:45:30]  nursing the beer, because you don't have money.  Yeah, you're broke.  When we went in, we didn't have money, we were in high school still.  Yeah.  And then the huge bouncer would pretty much stand very close to you and just stare at  you and your beer, and you would like get all nervous.  Wow, I never got that.  You never got that, and you would drink it faster?  No.  And then you're like, oh fuck, now I gotta order another one, and I only have $10 for  the night or whatever it would be.  I never got that, wow.  You never got the pressure?  Nope.  They would not say anything officially, but they would look at you to the point like, 
[02:46:00]  look, you gotta drink that beer.  Nah, just nurse the beer.  And then it was always good when you got one of the, we used to call them the saps, and  if the sap sat next to you and just had a stack of ones, you'd like get his dances.  Of course.  Because the chick would get on the bar and squat right in front of the guy.  So I'm a bar stool away, so I'm seeing everything.  For free.  Yeah.  So you gotta, you know, position yourself next to the sap.  We were gonna move on, but there's three great calls coming in.  Tom and Charlotte.  Tom, what's up? 
[02:46:30]  Hey man, how you guys doing?  Pretty good, man.  I used to go to this, I don't know if you, I wouldn't call it a club, but it was in the  middle of nowhere, Minnesota.  And the actual place was in a double-wide trailer.  The dancers would dance by a jukebox, and they would actually go around and ask for jukebox  money.  They had to shake you down for jukebox money?  So you went to a strip club in a trailer.  In a trailer.  Well, that's a class act. 
[02:47:00]  I don't know, can I say the name over the air?  No.  No?  The club?  All right.  All right, yeah, it doesn't matter.  It would matter to you and a couple of your buddies listening right now.  Yeah.  Thanks, Tom.  Yeah.  Strip club in a trailer, I've never heard of that before.  Dave in Arizona.  Dave.  Oh, and hey, what's going on, buddy?  Hey, man.  Hey, the first time I went to the strip club, a couple days after my 18th birthday in Arizona,  called the Bush Company, and I ran into the lunch lady from my elementary school. 
[02:47:30]  Well, there's always a dream, everybody, to see somebody from school stripping.  Not the lunch lady, though.  When I was living in...  Not this time.  Okay, really fast, and then you can continue.  When I was living in, I think it was Rochester, I was doing radio in Rochester, the strip club  up there came up with the most brilliant concept ever.  They basically somehow talked high school girls, well, old high school girls, sorry,  old high school girls to strip at the strip clubs.  And the commercials on the air would be, you might remember blah, blah from your high school. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  So it plays right into the fantasy.  You were saying, like, seeing some of the girls in your high school naked that you never  had a chance with, next thing you know, you're listening to the radio, and they're like,  yeah, remember blah, blah from blah, blah high school?  Well, she's stripping this weekend at this club.  And somehow they were able to pull this off week after week.  And eventually it would be the high school you went to.  Like, are you fucking kidding me?  What's her name?  Is it going to be there this weekend completely nude?  That is a great idea.  Isn't that a great concept?  Because, yeah, every guy wants that happening. 
[02:48:30]  And they had a clever name for the campaign and everything.  I forgot now.  Maybe someone's listening that remembers that.  But anyway, Dave, so lunch lady stripping.  Lunch lady stripping.  She had the gray short hair.  No, no, no.  Not hot.  So she was a typical lunch lady.  Oh, yeah.  What the hell is a gray-haired lunch lady stripping?  Yeah.  Do we have to call Bravo Sierra?  I'm a little suspect here.  No, no, no.  She was disgustingly horrible.  She wasn't that old. 
[02:49:00]  She was just wrinkly, kind of nasty.  Gray hair and wrinkly, but not that old.  Well.  Not that old, so.  All right, thank you.  I don't know.  I'm crashing him.  Let's say hi to Glenn in Utah.  Yeah, I don't know if we're buying into that one.  Glenn.  Yeah.  Hey.  How are you boys doing today?  Hey, man.  Someone's yelling, the classy cat.  Hey, yo, the classy cat.  Not that I know that or anything.  Just pure speculation.  Yeah.  But somebody knows exactly what I'm talking about. 
[02:49:30]  Girls from your high school stripping.  Glenn in Utah.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hey, it's simple as this.  I went to a brand new strip club.  First night, right?  Two pretty good-looking gals come out.  There's five stages out.  Both of these chicks wearing black thongs have nice little white mouse tails.  How's that to start the evening off?  They didn't tuck their strings?  No.  No, it was quite nice.  It absolutely was just a beautiful situation.  Are you exaggerating or are you into that? 
[02:50:00]  No, it is quite discouraging, needless to say, because they were both very good-looking  chicks, and to see the old mousetail hanging down.  The mousetail.  Mousetail, that is funny.  That's fucking disgusting.  I really don't know if I've ever heard it called that before.  That's amazing.  Yeah, the white mousetail.  There were some strippers that would walk over the bar, and you would put your hands  over your beer, try to be nonchalant about it.  You'd grab your cigarettes and kind of hold them over your beer until she passed by, because 
[02:50:30]  you didn't want anything falling into your beer as she was strutting.  The whole bar's doing the wave with their hand over there.  Yeah, yeah.  As she's moving, they're all like, kind of, or you'd pull the beer off and just take a  sip.  Oh, my God.  Could you pass by now?  She realizes you haven't given her any money, so she tries to give you a sexy look, and  you look away.  That is just nasty.  Let's keep walking.  One more.  Mousetail.  That's disturbing.  Crotch Critter.  What's up?  Oh.  Hey, Owen.  Hey.  I got one of the worst stripper stories ever. 
[02:51:00]  I was in the service.  A bunch of us went down to Memphis to a club down there.  This hot, hot chick comes out.  Starts dancing around and everything.  You know, basically, you know, you see her from the back.  She turns around, and I swear to God, it looked like a cougar, a mountain lion.  It just hung from one of her tits.  It was about six, eight inches longer than the other, and it just had stretch marks all  down the damn thing.  Later in the night, they do this thing where it's like a lotto.  You pick the girls.  They come off the stage, try to win prizes. 
[02:51:30]  They give away, like, free jackets, all that crap.  You know, we all go up there.  I stood in line.  I'm trying to.  There was another blonde up there.  But this chick, because I'd given her a couple dollars just to, like, you know, get her  to move down the bar, the chick with the mountain lion scar, she sits there and, like, cuts  through a line and reaches and grabs me.  There was nothing I could do about it.  And, of course, I didn't wear a jacket.  Sucked.  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  That's funny, though.  I like his stretch tit part of the story.  By the way, Classy Cat is wrong. 
[02:52:00]  John's got it from Jersey City.  It was Foxy's in Scottsville, New York.  This is absolutely true.  So, and the slogan was, come see girls in your neighborhood.  Come see girls in your neighborhood strip.  They were still doing those spots in 2003 when I was at R.I.K.  Yeah, that was the slogan.  Come see girls in your neighborhood strip.  We should start that bit on our show.  We should have girls come in. 
[02:52:30]  From high school.  Well, from high school, you know, days.  Like, you come in and you go, look, I went to blah, blah high school.  I graduated in blah, blah.  And even if you don't know the broad, you're still into seeing this girl naked.  Yeah.  But it'll be an extra treat for the people that'll go, oh, my God, I remember this girl.  They'll go through their freaking yearbooks and everything.  Anyway, want to start this or what?  Got that down.  All right.  Work on that.  That's good.  People love that shit.  Really do. 
[02:53:00]  All right, we're going to take a break.  We're going to regroup.  We haven't done it in a while.  It's one of my favorite bits when Patrice is here.  You want to do it or what?  Top country songs?  Yeah.  It's been a while.  They probably changed.  The people from PA are applauding.  More people from Pennsylvania come up to see this show than anywhere else in the country,  by the way.  Well, we'll see what you two are about in a little while, all right?  What?  Huh?  What the?  Who the?  Those two right there.  Oh, yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:53:30]  It's like radio on steroids.  With extra small testicles.  I have little balls.  Coming this Saturday.  No.  Coming this weekend, right?  Coming this weekend to the Saturday Night Virus.  It's the return of Black Phillip with Patrice O'Neill.  That's this Saturday from 9 p.m. to midnight on XM 202, The Virus.  All right.  We're back.  By the way, they're tallying the votes. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  We'll have the announcement, or the winners, I should say, for the video contest, the latest  video contest.  I went through those last night.  Wow.  There's some great, great, really good ones.  And some really bad ones.  Yeah.  We'll have the winners in a minute or two here.  You can check out the videos for yourself at opieandanthony.com.  All right.  We got country songs in front of us.  It's an interesting bit we do, because we don't know shit about country music.  And I think the truckers and, I don't know, some of the country fans out there, they enjoy 
[02:54:30]  this bit, because we're just clueless.  Well, they can relate.  Because they like it.  And they know what the songs are about, and we don't.  Yeah.  They know these songs like the back of their hand.  I mean, you should be proud of that.  But I'm looking at this list, and I'm trying to be honest with everybody.  There's not one of these songs I've heard.  Nope.  Every once in a while, I'll hear a country song.  I don't know any of these.  So we go through the top ten country songs.  We give the title of the song, and then we try to guess what the song is about. 
[02:55:00]  What the song's about, because country songs always have a story.  And it's very obvious.  It's the story, maybe not the title, and what it means, like what the story's about, what  this game is all about, is us trying to guess what the story's about just based on the title.  Yeah.  But the song itself usually has a very obvious story, as opposed to some abstract kind of  rock song or something where you can't really guess what it's about.  It's black and white there.  Well, no, it's all white. 
[02:55:30]  It's all white, right.  It's all white.  We wanted to do this with the top rap songs, and Patrice made a good point earlier, that  it's just way too obvious when you can't do it with rap songs.  What was your example again?  I'm going to fuck your bitch in the mouth.  Yeah, it's like, well, I think that's a song.  I think it's some double entendre going on here.  Yes, the mouth is a metaphor for society, and the dick would be...  Ain't no innuendo.  The song is, I'm going to fuck your bitch.  Nigga, if you walk up on me, I'm going to tell you something. 
[02:56:00]  I'm going to fuck your bitch in the mouth, and I'm going to shoot you in your face.  And that's about...  I wasn't even going to talk about this today, but I just took a peek at the TV here.  I know we jump all over the place.  You're used to that by now.  CNN is doing a piece on the South Park episode we discussed yesterday.  Probably one of the most controversial episodes.  If we have time, we'll play the clip for Patrice and see where he's at with that.  Okay.  First song.  We don't have to do all of these, because some of them, who gives a shit?  In 10th place, Jason Michael Carroll, a song called Alyssa Lies. 
[02:56:30]  Easy.  It's about Alyssa, and she lies.  Whore.  She told me she loved me.  I gave up my goofy redneck shit.  I gave up my horse, Calvin.  The bitch was allergic to horses, so I gave up Calvin the horse.  I traded in my really good... 
[02:57:00]  What's some other redneck shit?  I traded in my really good trailer for this shitty little car she wanted to drive.  And then, you know what?  Alyssa fucked my neighbor.  This bitch lie.  It's a this bitch song.  This funky bitch lie.  This fucking bitch, you think?  This fucking bitch song.  Now, do you think it's him?  Because I'm agreeing with you.  It's pretty obvious.  Alyssa lies.  Yeah.  She's definitely doing some lying.  Yeah, she's lying.  I don't think it means she lies down or something.  No.  Maybe... 
[02:57:30]  But maybe...  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Can I have a second guess?  Uh-huh.  A redo or a second guess?  Go redo.  This is stretching it.  Yeah.  It could be...  I think Alyssa's a guy.  Oh, she really lies.  It's very...  It's a very redneck-y...  You gotta stay redneck-y.  Yeah, you gotta get in a redneck mindset.  All right.  Now.  Okay.  All right, now.  Hey, Jim.  I met this girl. 
[02:58:00]  Her name's Alyssa.  Yeah.  Alyssa.  Alyssa.  Alyssa McGillicuddy up the street.  Dude, this is gonna be my fucking answer, you bastard.  All right, go ahead.  I swear.  Finish it off.  That is Buddy.  He's telling his buddy.  Be careful.  Be...  Watch it, because Alyssa lies.  That was gonna be my fucking answer.  That is very...  That is way out there.  Yeah, it is.  I thought it was a little out there, too, but I'm like...  It is possible.  I think it could be he's talking to a buddy.  You might be giving him too much credit.  Yeah, yeah.  But hey, man, be careful, because that's what I heard. 
[02:58:30]  Don't fall for this bitch.  Alyssa lies.  All right.  But, uh...  Well, she's gonna tell you that she blah, blah, blah, but remember this fucking cunt lies.  But that's not redneck-y.  I don't know, Dan.  All right, let's find out.  Like telling your buddy.  What are you guessing?  I just went for the goof guess.  I went for, uh, she's a guy.  She's a guy?  Just to keep it goofy.  I don't know.  I asked for a sample, and the bitch had an Adam's sample.  I don't know. 
[02:59:00]  She's...  That fucking Alyssa lies.  All right, here we go.  Alyssa lies.  He's really Jeff.  Jason and Michael Carroll.  I had a girl that a new friend chose the other day.  On the playground at school.  Between the tires and the swing.  But she came home with tear-filled eyes.  And she said to me, Daddy, Alyssa...  What the fuck is this about? 
[02:59:30]  About what?  Well, I just brushed it off at first.  Because I didn't know much about it.  Hold on.  What?  Hold on.  What?  Without knowing any more than this...  Daughter in school.  Daughter's in school.  She comes home crying, saying, Alyssa lies.  Mommy and Daddy aren't together anymore.  Maybe.  What?  And the kid at school knows through the parents.  And she told Alyssa...  She told the daughter that, hey, Mommy and Daddy aren't together anymore. 
[03:00:00]  Your Mommy and Daddy are divorced.  And she said, no, Alyssa lies.  And now he's got to tell her, no, we're not together anymore.  These crackers are getting complicated.  Fucking what the fuck?  Holy shit.  Actually, Alyssa's telling the truth.  Yeah, it's going to be like...  I guess I've got to tell you now.  No.  Your daddy's a queer.  Yeah.  Let's see what this...  Go ahead.  All right.  Well, I just brushed it off at first  Cause I didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt 
[03:00:30]  Or the things she had seen  I wasn't ready when I said you could tell me  And she said, Alyssa lies  Yeah, well...  I'm done.  To the classroom  Alyssa lies  Every day in school 
[03:01:00]  Oh...  Alyssa lies  Child abuse  Oh...  To the teacher  What?  If you're looking at instant feedback, I'm going to fucking...  You cover every bruise  You bastard  It's child abuse  No, I'm serious  It is child abuse  It's child abuse  You just said you're trying to cover every bruise  But what's she lying about?  Alyssa's coming to school with a lot of bruises  And she's making a lot of excuses  And she's lying  Because she's getting beat up all the time 
[03:01:30]  Oh, this is weight  What is this shit?  How the fuck are we supposed to guess that?  What are rednecks doing trying to elevate?  What happened to honky-tonk, badonky-donk?  What happened to...  All right, hold on  Hanky-braky heart, you motherfuckers  Enough of you trying to...  This is...  My name is Luca  Country version  Someone is...  Reading from Wackbag  Alyssa sounds like a size queen  Kristen in Jersey  What's up?  Hi  Hey  Hi, you're on the air 
[03:02:00]  Oh my god, Kristen  Come on  Oh, hi  Yeah, the song's about child abuse  And she actually died  So it's like she lies with Jesus  Wait, what?  No  No, listen to the whole song  That's it  At the end, is she dead?  She dies, yeah  All right, she dies of the child abuse  But now Alyssa lies with Jesus  Are you kidding me?  Alyssa lies dead  You know what?  Yeah, yeah  Go to the end of this fucking song  Enough of you  I gotta hear this 
[03:02:30]  All right, now we gotta hear more  Piece of shit  All right, go ahead  What happened to fucking  Spin your partner round and round, you fucking crackers?  What the hell's going on?  Enough of this  So everyone wants to know where Alyssa is  And she's dead  And she lies  Her daughter's asking questions  And now the father's gotta say, look  So it's not even...  She lies with Jesus  It's quadruple entendre  Entendre  It's like Alyssa's  We have the lyrics?  That makes it a lot easier  This guy must have made it all the way to the sixth grade  Johnny stares  What do you mean with his eyes?  Or he fell down the stairs?  Yeah, what the fuck? 
[03:03:00]  Oh, jeez  I'm Jason Michael Carroll  I'm writing a very sensitive song  I forgot we have to have the Schwarzenegger  Alyssa lies  It makes sense now  I don't even know why  Oh my god  He's making it very difficult  Let's hear the end of this a little bit  Alyssa lies to the classroom  Alyssa lies every day at school  Alyssa lies to the teachers  As she tries to cover her bruise  I had the worst night of sleep in years 
[03:03:30]  As I tried to think of a way to calm her fears  I knew just what it was I had to do  But when we got to school on Monday  I heard the news  Oh no  Let's hear it  Wait, wait  We got it queued up  Alright, go  My little girl asked me  Why everybody looks so sad  The lump in my throat grew bigger  With every question that she asked  Until I felt the tears run down my face 
[03:04:00]  And I told her that Alyssa  Wouldn't be its good day  Oh no, why not?  Why not?  Tell me, please  She doesn't lie  In the classroom  Uh-uh  She doesn't lie  Uh-uh  Anymore at school  Oh boy  Where's she like?  Alyssa lies  With Jesus  Because there's nothing 
[03:04:30]  In anyone to do  Tears fill my eyes  When my little girl asked me why  Jesus  What the fuck?  What a morbid song  What the hell's going on with country music?  What the fuck is going on?  Stop whining  Who is your daddy

[03:13:00]  Not good  Not a happy  Guitar lick there  Sounds a little  Dark  Huh  And the fiddle  Comes in  The gentleman  Carrie Underwood  On Country 105  Standing at the back door  She tried to make it fast  Once you hit the hardwood 
[03:13:30]  It fell like broken glass  She said  Sometimes love slips away  And you just can't get it back  Let's face it  For one split second  She almost turned around  But that would be like  Goring rain drops  Back into a cloud  So she took another step  Said I see the way out  And I'm gonna take it 
[03:14:00]  Another abusive guy thing  I don't wanna spend my life  Jaded  Waiting  To wake up one day  And find  That a lot of these years  Go by  Wasted  Yeah  There you go  She didn't write that even  So he stumbles to the scene 
[03:14:30]  And pours it down the drain  He said  It's time to be a man  And stop living for yesterday  Gotta face it  A bunch of little stories  A bunch of little stories  About courage  Cause I don't wanna spend my life  Jaded  See the first one's the bitch  She's maybe in a bad relationship  So she don't wanna waste it  So she walks out the door  And then this is a guy  And he's a drunk  And he's fucking  Pours a whiskey down the drain  Well she's in love with the guy  But he's a drunk 
[03:15:00]  I don't know  Does the story relate?  I think it's just individual stories  Really?  He's 21  Yeah what does she know?  Why is she singing about that?  It's metaphoric  He's an alcoholic  And she doesn't want him  Spend her time wasted  Wasting time with this guy  Cause he's going nowhere  Cause his drinking  No but he gave up  The drinking  He gave up the drinking  Now the next verse  Will be about someone else  She's not buying into it  The next verse  Will be about someone else  That was just symbolic  But he's not really 
[03:15:30]  Giving up drinking  The moon and the sun  Were floating side by side  He looked in the mirror  And his eyes were clean  For the first time  His drinking  His drinking  Has affected the relationship  He has finally realized that  And now he's going to try  To not drink anymore  Cause he saw the effect 
[03:16:00]  That he had on her  She was leaving  For the last time  I don't know  I want to tell you  To be honest with you  Country people  Are made  They have a  A high attention span  They don't have  The ADD  Because  Unlike pop  And some rap  Right  Yeah  The song is about  Jack shit  And then  It's the hook  You know  Like you know  Blah blah blah blah blah  And then it's like  Bah yeah  That's the hook  Yeah  This shit  Is like

[03:22:00]  His son comes home  Uh huh  And there's a retarded kid  In his son's class  And he's telling him  He gets up  And he's going  And he's  And the hook is  He's a stupid boy  He's a stupid boy  He's a stupid boy son  It's about a retard  That's what I say  It's about a retarded boy  It's about a retarded kid  At school  And the son  The normal son  Comes home to his father  And tells him about  The stupid boy  In the playground  And he says  No son  He's special 
[03:22:30]  Oh wow  Am I close  I hate cheating  But wow  We're so off still  Really  Maybe it's good I cheat  To try to  Help you along a little bit  Stupid  Wow  Not even close  No  It's not  It's not what you think  Boy isn't being  Using the old southern terminology  Is it  No  Okay  So maybe  Well they are  It could happen Patrice  The number one hit 
[03:23:00]  In country is  What is with this  N word shit  What happened to nigger  That's the hook  But what happened  To nigger  My mouth won't even move  And say n word  N word  Stupid n word  No you can't even say that  Wow  So we're totally off  What did you say again  I said it's  He's stupid  For losing a great relationship  It's gotta be that  No  You would think  It'd be as obvious 
[03:23:30]  What else could they  That's why it's been so good  Because you would think  It'd be the obvious answer  Stupid boy  Maybe you wouldn't  Call himself a boy  But here we go  Let's listen  A little feel  Yeah  More sadness  Yeah  Of course  It's country  Goodness  Fucking people  White people  She was precious  Like a flower  Yeah  Yeah  Right  She grew wild  Wild  But innocent 
[03:24:00]  Yeah  A perfect prayer  In a desperate hour  She was everything  Beautiful  And different  Stupid boy  You can't fence  That in  Stupid boy  Who  It's like  Holding back  The wind  She let her heart 
[03:24:30]  So rot  In your hands  You stole her  Every dream  And you crushed  Her plans  I mean that's in the same  She kind of ditched her  She had a choice  And that's what happens  When the only voice  She hears  Is telling her  She can't  Stupid boy  Isn't this what I said?  Well yeah  The second 
[03:25:00]  The chorus explains it  I only read the first part  Jesus  The first part  Wait  I want to defend myself though  The first part  It's very close  It makes it sound like  She's unattainable  Like you're stupid  For thinking that  This unbelievable girl  Would be  With a guy like you  Ah  And then  Then the chorus  Pretty much  Makes it  That you're right  I thought  When I heard the  Opening there  I thought  He was stupid  Because this girl  Really likes him 
[03:25:30]  And he's like  You know  Not giving her  The time of day  And he realizes  What he missed out on  Which would have been  You know  Close but different  From what I said  It was like  It was all in the same  Avenue  You know what I'm saying  Shit  I'm so glad  I'm not a fan  Of this shit  So if I ever meet  Keith Urban  Like I don't know him  Enough to not ever  Have to say anything  Nice to him  Like if I meet him  And it's like  Wow you're Keith Urban  You know I listen to a lot  Your shit stinks  Like I don't have to  Like Keith Urban  It's like I might  Meet him somewhere  Bumping to him  And it's like  Hey stupid boy

[03:27:30]  Shitty relationship  And he's kind of  Waiting and watching  And seeing what happens  So he can grab her up  You're not looking  At the spelling  Alright  He's looking through a window  And he's jerking off  To a Chinese girl  Yeah that was my first choice  And I should have  Stuck with that  Well I'm watching you  I'm watching you  I'm watching  I'm watching you  I'm watching Johnny You  And I'm being my dick  This song is for Bill Murray  And Caddyshack  He's watching  Watching you  Actually it's  He talks about  Looking through Alyssa's window

[03:28:30]  So he's kind of  Watching over her  Watching her  He's got her back  And waiting  No fucking way  It's as simple as what he said  He's watching  He is watching a chick  These low self esteem  Country music guys  He's watching a girl  That he likes  And he just can't  Find her  He can't make the move  And he wishes he could  Can't make the move  There's no way  But the song's gonna end  With a little hope  Oh good  Maybe she smiles at the end  She dies  Alright  Any other answers coming in  Yeah that's about it  And the end of the song  He's gonna be
