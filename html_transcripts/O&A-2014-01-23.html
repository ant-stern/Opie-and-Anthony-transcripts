<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties, specifically a "tinny" and "hollow" sound from their microphones.  This was quickly followed by a discussion about a co-worker, Mars, receiving a vaginoplasty and the ongoing saga of a new, smaller studio monitor replacing a large, problematic one.  Numerous emails from Tim Sabian and Don Wicklin detailing the monitor's delayed arrival due to a snowstorm were read aloud.  The hosts extensively detailed their complaints about the old monitor, which interfered with their boom mics, before celebrating its eventual replacement.  The conversation then shifted to a former employee who surprisingly thrived after receiving a "participation trophy," and transitioned into a discussion of the harsh winter weather, cold car starts, and the relative merits of living in cold versus warm climates, sparked by idyllic social media posts from warmer locations.  This led to a discussion of Governor Cuomo's comments about conservatives not belonging in New York and Sean Hannity's potential departure from the state.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a Wendy Williams show clip where she discussed Madonna's use of the term "dis n---a," analyzing the audience's reaction and the complexities of racial slurs.  This was followed by a longer segment dissecting another Wendy Williams clip showing her emotional on-air revelation that her son no longer likes her.  The hosts repeatedly played and analyzed this clip, highlighting the audience's reactions and Wendy's emotional breakdown, speculating on the reasons behind her son's feelings.  The show then featured a "web redemption" from Tosh.0, showcasing a crying wrestling fan, Dave, and his humorous interaction with The Million Dollar Man and Coco Beware.  A prank phone call segment and a brief discussion about adopting versus buying cats concluded this section.

A later segment focused heavily on animal rescue, beginning with a humorous anecdote about an aggressive cat. This led to a broader discussion about the challenges of adopting rescue animals compared to raising pets from a young age, including exaggerated and offensive jokes about drugging rescue animals. The hosts shared their own experiences with family members deeply involved in animal rescue. This was followed by a highly offensive discussion about Justin Bieber's DUI/drag racing arrest, punctuated by numerous jokes and speculation using offensive language. A caller, Jay from Tampa, briefly contributed, leading to a humorous misunderstanding about a previous radio show phrase ("BAB").

This segment also included a significant portion dedicated to a weight-loss competition between E-Rock and Roland, overseen by Dr. Ian Smith. The hosts expressed frustration over the lack of communication and missing supplies from Dr. Smith. E-Rock and Roland discussed their progress, strategies, and difficulties following the plan due to the missing components.  A weigh-in revealed their progress, followed by further criticism of Dr. Smith. A caller shared a humorous anecdote about kissing an unexpectedly large woman while intoxicated.  The segment ended with discussions of a perceived fake and animal-abusive reality TV show and a call about a "heavy hotties" themed bar. E-Rock was present in the studio for this segment.  Sal, a staff member, was also mentioned.

Another segment began with Dennis recounting a spring break story involving an overweight woman. This transitioned into a discussion of the supposedly fake reality TV show "Turtle Man" and a proposed fake show concept, "Jaguar World." Opie shared a lengthy anecdote about a disastrous blind date arranged via CB radio, where the woman, "Dreamweaver," was far heavier than anticipated.  A caller, Troy, briefly discussed "Turtle Man."  A call with Dr. Ian Smith promoting his "Super Shred" diet followed, with E-Rock and Roland complaining about lack of communication and supplies (popcorn and a blender).  A significant portion revolved around their grievances with Dr. Smith, culminating in Roland abandoning the diet. Dr. Smith eventually promised to send the missing supplies.  The hosts then discussed the fallout, accusing each other of "folding" under pressure.  They also debated Richard Sherman's post-Super Bowl interview and whether his use of "thug" was a racial slur.  The segment ended with further discussion of Dr. Ian Smith and Mike Francesa's reaction to a previous bit, including a humorous anecdote about repeatedly "raping" (pretend rape) a co-worker method acting as Ron Burgundy.

The final segment began with a discussion about the Super Bowl and weather forecasting accuracy.  This unexpectedly shifted to a story about former Redskins player David Copay's one-night stand with Jerry Smith, who later died of AIDS, leading to a discussion about closeted gay athletes in the NFL.  The hosts then reacted to a graphic description of a 1970s-style gay porn featuring Fez and Dave, detailing the intimate acts depicted.  The discussion then moved to Justin Bieber's arrest and the arrests related to the Lufthansa heist in *Goodfellas*, with Bo Dietl and Arthur Idalla called in to discuss the case.  The show concluded with a lengthy discussion of a Noel Gallagher supercut mocking his old music videos and a call from Bobby, a largely forgotten former intern known as "Bobby the Champ," prompting reminiscing about other interns like Cream Pie Jones and "Eyebrow Kid." The hosts then abruptly ended the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, good morning everyone.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  And the mics sound...  Today the mics sound bad.  Are they bad?  A little tinny.  Extremely tinny.  A little tinny.  Sam, we can't do it.  We have to go home.  No, I'm not even joking. 
[00:00:30]  I can do my test.  I normally go, welcome aboard.  Nice to hear it.  You hear it, right?  It feels a little hollow.  Yeah, something going on.  It's all in our content.  Oh, it's always the way.  But, alright, Mars is getting, what?  His vagina worked on.  Yes.  Vagioplasty.  Vagioplasty.  He's having a couple of stitches put in to tighten it up.  Dangling lips for embarrassing him in bikinis.  Mars.  So how hard is it, whoever replaces him, to just have the studio set like we usually do? 
[00:01:00]  Why have they made this so complicated?  I don't know why it changes every morning.  It's just amazing.  You just think it would be left alone.  Right.  I think the problem is that we don't have a regular replacement.  Right.  It's just like, who's here in the morning?  But why would they screw with the sound of the mic anyway?  You think there'd be like a list, like just a checklist.  Just do it this way.  But shouldn't they have like a one sheet?  Oh, here's all the settings.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  I don't get it.  Well, I get that, though.  Hey, look.  You know what I'm looking at right now?  It's right in front of me.  You don't like that?  No.  A tiny little monitor.  There it is.  A little excitement in the air today.  Quite the buzz.  Tiny monitor.  Quite the buzz to the point, Tim Sabian.  I love Tim Sabian, and I'm all in with Tim.  Because at this point, I just have to be. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  People are asking why.  I'm like, because I just have to be at this point.  You can't bitch for 20 years and then fucking not do something about it.  Yeah, yeah.  This is our last shot.  Yeah.  Good old Tim is our last shot.  And he sent out an email yesterday that he finally, you know, replaced your giant monitor  with a smaller monitor.  Yes.  I didn't write him back.  Oh, you didn't?  And he was so excited about it.  I wrote him back.  You did?  Yeah.  What do you write?  Because it's kind of, you know, my thing. 
[00:02:30]  I've been bitching about this giant fucking monitor that's been in front of me since we  got here.  Yeah.  And since we put in these new boom mics for Jimmy and the guests a while back, the boom  mic hits the top of the monitor if I don't come in every morning and push it down.  And it's a hassle because you've got to push it down, but not too much or it'll sink the  entire way down to the floor.  Yeah.  On the bracket it's on.  Yeah.  So it's just been this thing, this ritual that I've had to do every morning that I fucking 
[00:03:00]  just, I hated it.  Right.  And the monitor was too big and bulky.  It takes up too much room.  So I've been asking for this little monitor.  Well, the past week people have been scurrying, scurrying, I say, to get this monitor.  Apparently it was affected by the snowstorm because it was coming up from D.C. with Don  Wicklin.  And Don couldn't make it up because of the snowstorm.  And the monitor couldn't make it.  And oh my lord.  So yesterday, as I was trying to escape the show, at the end of the show, Tim Sabian came 
[00:03:30]  up and started talking about said monitor.  Right.  And how he's going to rip that goddamn thing out.  And tomorrow this big monitor won't be here.  But he said that a few times.  Well, everyone has said that for well over three years.  Yeah.  So this morning I walk in and, well actually I got the emails last night.  I got one from Tim Sabian.  I got actually two from Tim Sabian and one from Don Wicklin. 
[00:04:00]  All about the monitor.  There's a buzz in the studio.  Oh, the studio is a buzz.  Because right in front of me is a tiny little monitor.  Maybe.  With the phones on it.  Maybe we could give Tim Sabian the participation trophy.  You know what?  Where's that thing?  Is it still around?  He's officially done more than the person that was supposed to get it.  Do you remember that guy at all at this point?  I don't even remember their names. 
[00:04:30]  I saw him in the hall just having small talk.  Did you?  With another music guy and they were just like, well, you know, that's a good idea.  Just happy.  Oh, it must be nice.  Remember how many times we brought him almost to tears?  You think Deep Tracks ever wants to go to the Super Bowl?  No.  You think Deep Tracks ever?  You think fucking the 90s channel ever wants to fucking put together a bus tour or a cruise  or a comedy thing?  But he was holding his coffee having that small talk about one of the music channels here. 
[00:05:00]  He loves it.  He's good at that.  I've always said it.  They love the fact that they're not dealing with this fucking program anymore.  I'm just mad he didn't take his participation trophy.  What does it say?  A world's greatest secretary?  I don't think he took it in the spirit in which it was intended.  No, I think he did, actually.  Yeah, that's probably why.  Well, that's why he had no business being with us to begin with.  Because when you just take the trophy as a goof, go, oh, that's funny, guys.  Okay, I'm moving on.  You're moving on.  Thanks for the silly. 
[00:05:30]  I would just be like, oh, thanks for the silly trophy.  Or you could take it and then maybe put it on someone's chair the next morning.  Like, hey, stick this up your ass.  Oh, whoa.  Whatever, you know.  Or, yeah.  Yeah, do a little Bad News Bears thing.  Right.  Yeah.  Take it and then throw it at us.  Dude, that's what he did.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  What a great scene.  Yeah.  Anyway.  So, yeah, the great monitor controversy is finally over. 
[00:06:00]  Nice.  I have a tiny little monitor here.  Let me squint and see.  Is that Jimmy from Jersey?  What do we want to get done next?  Um, I know.  We got it one step at a time.  Maybe a good dusting.  A dusting.  Ah, look at all that shit over there.  But they did leave out the keyboard and mouse for me in front.  And I don't use the keyboard and mouse.  That's your keyboard? 
[00:06:30]  Apparently, it was in front of me.  So, I had to throw it over there.  I only needed the monitor.  I just need to see the calls.  I don't need the ability to take the calls.  So, how about that's our next...  Oh, I think Ronnie uses that.  Is that what it is?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Ronnie's doing his show from our studio.  Is he like, ah, this monitor, I can't see it.  Too small.  Yeah.  And it has...  I had quite a delightful time with them on the air.  Yes.  With Ronnie Fez.  Yeah, it was really a very fun...  They're doing it, man.  They're doing very well.  Yeah.  They're doing great.  So... 
[00:07:00]  Absolute re.  Well, it's day two of this polar vortex.  It is a little cold out.  And boy, they love talking about it, don't they?  Yep.  But I haven't seen anyone with the shirts.  The frozen shirts.  I think that was a...  They realized that was kind of getting hacky.  Yeah, yeah.  Even they realized.  Yeah, they got killed.  They got killed for it.  Yes.  They did.  Not just us.  Everyone went after us.  Everyone.  It's eight degrees this morning in New York City.  Yeah.  Boy, you gotta love that auto fucking start on a vehicle. 
[00:07:30]  You get up, and while you're still like, you start your fucking vehicle.  There's nothing better than hearing that noise from the warmth of your house.  Oh, oh, oh.  That comes in handy with kids and traveling.  Let me tell you.  Oh, I bet.  Let me tell you.  The old days where you're like, I gotta go out and warm the car up.  And you'd have to trudge out.  Remember the...  Well, remember the days you would just say, fuck it, and jump in, and the first 15 minutes 
[00:08:00]  of your ride to work was just miserable, and then you'd finally start feeling that heat  coming?  Yeah.  You'd be like Quasimodo hunched over the steering wheel, because for some reason, you'd  have to lean forward as much as you can to hold that body warmth.  Well, your stupid body does weird things to try to get some warmth going.  Yeah.  Yeah, it hunches you over.  The steering wheel's cold.  What about not even dealing with the windshield, either?  So you would turn on your car, crank the heat and the vents, and then just start going 
[00:08:30]  to work through this ice shield.  Looking through this little tank.  And then you would get really happy when it would give you about an inch or two, and  you would lean all the way down as you're flying down the LIE.  Hit the wipers like, oh, another quarter inch came off.  That's good.  That's good.  And then all of a sudden, you get that nice wipe where it's like, whoosh, like, ah, nice.  And then you're nice and warm as you're pulling into your fucking parking spot.  Yeah.  The steering wheel, you'd have to pull your sleeves over your hands because the steering 
[00:09:00]  wheel, those old school steering wheels that would be like 10 degrees colder than outside  for some reason.  Yeah.  We've lived through some things.  Had some advancements in the automotive industry as far as comfort goes, that's for  sure.  The heated seat is another thing that's great.  I'm a big fan of the heated seat.  The heated seat.  Even in the summer.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not.  Why?  I crank up my AC and then I get a nice warm back.  It's a great combination.  I've never heard of such a thing. 
[00:09:30]  I can't take that.  I got a shitty back from being a caddy way back in the day.  Caddy.  My back is shitty.  I'm always constantly working on it.  So a little heat on there would be nice.  Oh, it's nice.  And the lumbar?  Do you fucking pump that lumbar up?  My latest car doesn't have a lumbar.  What?  Yeah, I used to love the lumbar.  You're a white man.  I would push that lumbar button.  Yeah.  It just bends you back.  You're like, oh, that's good.  Oh, do I love a good lumbar.  I don't understand why they haven't come up with something in the seat where it's an automatic massage. 
[00:10:00]  Because it'll probably put people to sleep as they're driving.  Just going up and down.  Just a very basic roller from top to bottom.  I bet there are things they've thought of that people have said, no, we can't do that.  People will just literally fall asleep as they're driving.  How about if...  It can't be too comfy.  How about this?  When you're down to a certain speed, meaning you're bumper to bumper, motherfucking traffic, and you're miserable, that's when that shit works.  But as soon as you get over a certain speed, it don't work no more.  I don't like that. 
[00:10:30]  That's like that GPS thing in my vehicle where it's like I start moving and I can't adjust the map or anything.  You have to be stopped to do it.  You have to be stopped.  It's a pain in the ass.  You can squeeze one.  You can squeeze.  You can as you're rolling off a red light, but if you start getting over like 10 miles an hour...  Oh, mine will reset so you can squeeze as you're driving.  Yeah.  You got to do it in steps.  Like, okay, I got to step one in.  All right, now, damn it's not letting me do anything right now.  But then it lets me do a little more.  It really is more distracting than if I was just able to do it because now you're looking, seeing if you can adjust it. 
[00:11:00]  It's taking longer.  Do they have voice control for that yet?  They got to get voice control for that.  I was just about to ask.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, my car is a little old.  I got to get a new car.  Yeah.  I'm up to like, I don't know.  Wow, my car might be like five years old already.  Five years?  Yeah, shit.  You got the 2015 Escalade.  You're getting that?  Spring, yeah.  Nice.  It was out this spring.  All new, redesigned.  Redesigned for the homies.  The homies love the Escalade. 
[00:11:30]  I want to talk about what we were talking about as we were leaving yesterday.  What was that?  How stupid it is to live in cold climates.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were having this discussion after the show.  Like, there's no reason why you should be living in an area where it gets cold for three or  four months of the year where you just do nothing and waste your life.  Yeah, yeah.  I was thinking that.  And with social media and, you know, the Instagram and the Twitter and whatnot, you see people 
[00:12:00]  just having the best days as you're sitting in eight degree weather.  Doing nothing.  Just waiting.  I saw a picture of someone just, oh, here's the Santa Monica Pier tonight, and there's  just people jogging on the beach with barely anything on, going for a stroll, going for  a bike ride.  And I'm like, we can't do any of this for another three months.  Why would you do this?  I don't even check the mail.  It's not that.  I don't even want to go outside.  But why do we do this to ourselves?  And the answer is really simple. 
[00:12:30]  I told Ant, the only reason you stay where you are is because of your family or your  job.  Yeah, yeah.  Because if it wasn't for my family, and actually at this point, if it wasn't for  my wife's family, because, you know, I would just say, let's go.  There's better places to live.  But you're stuck in your area mostly because of your family.  Hannity had a thing he was talking about leaving New York because it ties into that Cuomo thing.  Right, right.  And Cuomo, our governor, said that New York's not really a place for conservatives and conservative 
[00:13:00]  candidates because if you're pro-anti-abortion, if you're a pro-assault weapon, which I don't  even know what that means, and anti-gay, you have no place in New York.  Right.  And it's like, well, that's not a dick thing to say.  It's all ideology, first of all.  It doesn't necessarily go hand in hand with...  If you don't like the fact that gays are getting married, that does not go hand in  hand with being anti-gay or wanting harm to come to gays or anything like that. 
[00:13:30]  It's your opinion.  Abortion is a very strong issue, and it's pretty much a 50-50 issue in the country.  I'm sure in New York, it leans close to people wanting the ability to get abortions.  But again, it's a religious thing.  It's an opinion.  That's been an extremely boring tug-of-war for 40 how many years?  One years, one years, are we up to?  Yeah.  Where it's like, oh, they got the edge.  Whoa, now we got the edge. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Like, nothing is getting done on that issue.  And saying pro-assault weapons, it's semantics.  You're saying pro-Second Amendment, which is a right to the Constitution, you dumb fuck.  So a lot of people are getting pissed at him.  And Hannity, of course, being a conservative, leaning right Republican.  He's laying on his right shoulder.  Yes, yes.  He was saying that he will leave New York as soon as he can.  Wow, that's just all.  The people are saying it's a cop-out, what are you talking about? 
[00:14:30]  That's all bullshit.  He's like...  I love the people that say they're going to leave.  They never leave.  But it's his job, and his kids are going to school still, and stuff like that.  So it is, I, but I could relate, because I would love to leave this state.  I would love to take my fucking tax dollars and fuck you and leave and go somewhere else.  Leave.  And, uh, somewhere where I think personal freedoms are a little, uh, uh, better.  You would love Texas.  You were made for Texas.  I would love a place like Texas.  California? 
[00:15:00]  California's terrible, too.  California.  Oh, my God, California's horrendous.  Yeah, California's horrible.  Um, but, but, I can't leave either.  I mean, you have responsibilities, you have, uh, you know, you can't just pick up and fucking leave.  It's not that easy.  Oh, I would, oh, it's easy.  Huh?  I have no problem.  It's so easy.  There are just responsibilities you have to people and family, things like that.  And, you know, there are just things that kind of keep you stuck in. 
[00:15:30]  I have no love for New York State anymore, and I used to be a proud New Yorker, but,  uh, you realize this is such a lefty fucking state, such a nanny state, a state that's  just stripping people of their, their wealth and their fucking, uh, uh, rights and freedoms.  It's crazy.  It's just a shitty thing for him to say, too.  It is a shitty thing for him to say.  You know, in America, people have different opinions on shit.  Right.  And I guess he doesn't want that.  Well, they're trying to, the liberals will constantly try to paint an opposing viewpoint 
[00:16:00]  as some type of extremism.  Right.  So, so if you're against abortion, you're a person that would bomb an abortion clinic.  Right.  There's no gray area in there.  If you're, um, a pro-Second Amendment person, you're a school shooter.  Right.  Uh, if you, if you don't like the fact that, you know, two gay guys are making out in front  of you, you want to kill gay people.  You need glasses. 
[00:16:30]  It's like, what bar are you in?  But it, that's, that's usually the way they operate.  It's, uh, to paint, uh, them as extremists, and, uh, it's just not true.  Yeah, I don't think that's healthy.  You gotta.  No, he's a fucking live asshole.  That's a dick thing to say.  You gotta consider all opinions.  Be a liberal asshole like your father.  By the way, there, but there is a thing you should, cold climate, people who live in a  cold climate live an average of nine years longer than people who live in a hot climate.  So maybe that's a motive. 
[00:17:00]  No, I'm not part of this.  I mean, Jesus.  Oh, you made that up?  That was good.  I bet, I bet there's some credence to that, though.  No, all I keep thinking about is that, Sam said I look cheeky after a couple seconds,  and I just fell apart.  No, it's, you, you nail it, but then you can't hold on to it.  No, I, I just panicked.  I was actually thinking maybe a lot of third world nations are in warmer climates than  colder climates.  So I bet you're right anyway.  I bet there is a disparity there.  Man, I don't know.  I just.  The older you get, though, this, this cold weather.  Yeah, it just blows. 
[00:17:30]  Because one guy's like, cold climates are awesome.  Oh, shut up.  I hate people that are like, I love getting up on a nice, brisk, crisp morning, taking  a jog in the brisk, crisp air.  Even when I was skiing a lot, I hated being in cold climates, because the downtime between  getting to a slope sucked.  Exactly.  It takes much longer to get, you know, your shit together for the day.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Why do people decide to settle in areas that the, the, literally the essence of life, water, 
[00:18:00]  Right.  turns to a solid.  Right.  It's like, who thought that was a good idea?  Hey, you know that water stuff that we need to live?  Yeah, it freezes into a big block of solid shit.  Easy to carry that way.  Hey, hand me that water.  All right.  You throw some of the block of water.  That's great.  Let's bring it in the cave and fucking heat it and we'll just drink it.  Yeah.  Try to carry regular water around.  Yeah.  It'll be rough.  And plus, there's no wildlife hunting you in the fucking winter.  Well.  I'll bet you that's why they like it.  I bet there's some wolves and a few, but. 
[00:18:30]  Snow wolves.  I think they're a bit more ornery in the winter.  You're kidding me.  Oh, yeah.  They really need the, the food at that point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  But, it's cold.  It's cold for what?  Most of the country?  Jimmy's going to Atlanta today and it's going to, it's going to be cold down there as well.  It's fucking, I checked the weather last week.  Last night in Atlanta, it's, it's, it was eight, 14 degrees here or 16 degrees here,  32 in Atlanta.  So, it's, it's, it's human there, but it stinks.  It's not for them.  Nine degrees here, 25 in Atlanta. 
[00:19:00]  So, we're 16 degrees warmer here.  It's nothing.  Wow.  Meanwhile, LA is.  It's below freezing.  It's below freezing.  LA is 52 degrees and it's four in the morning.  Oh, and they're fucking, they're freaking out probably.  It's freezing.  Yes.  52.  Yes, they, they, they don't understand.  They don't like their chilly nights.  No.  No, they don't understand.  No.  All right.  So, that's it on the weather, I guess.  Yeah.  It's our big weather break.  Although, I don't have a picture of it, but did you hear about the Apple store on Fifth  Avenue?  Yeah.  A little, little window mishap. 
[00:19:30]  No.  A snow plow, I guess, I don't know.  Got one of the blades caught, caught in the side of the Apple store and shattered the  whole fucking thing.  It's going to cost a half million dollars.  Wait, all of those windows?  Or just one of them?  It is shattered.  I thought it was a panel.  Just one window.  Was it one panel?  Did they close the store or no?  Um, I, I, I, no, I would assume they would figure.  Do you have a picture?  Because I haven't seen the picture.  It was all crackly, but it stayed in place.  Oh, it didn't cave in.  Oh.  No, I'm sure they have like a 60.  They made it sound like this thing was shattered, shattered. 
[00:20:00]  It's one, one of the panels.  Yeah, just one panel.  Which panel, though?  It, it looks like when an iPhone screen cracks.  Which is ironic.  Yes.  There it is.  See?  Oh, yeah.  See, that's a lot, though.  Okay.  What did that used to be?  One panel, that's, that's like 25 feet high.  That's a panel that's about 20, wait, six, two, probably 25 feet high by eight feet,  maybe.  Right?  I'm sure that's an expensive piece of glass, and it has to be safety. 
[00:20:30]  They're saying a half million.  Half million is to fix it.  What did that used to be?  Do you remember what that was before it was an Apple store?  I don't remember.  That Apple store was really cool because their glass box is, you know, you have to, you walk  downstairs.  There's nothing to see in that glass box from the street, really.  It's strange.  It's just popping up.  You go in, and then you do, you take the staircase down to the action.  I think that's probably the coolest store I've ever been is the New York Apple store.  That's 5th Avenue.  Oh my God, a 24-hour Apple store with just a big, if you haven't been here, it's a giant  glass box on 5th Avenue. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, you walk into that.  You just walk in down the steps.  It's so fucking cool.  Well, most of them are glass boxes now, but, but the uniqueness of that, there's nothing  in that glass box.  Everything's underground.  Yeah, you walk in, and you walk downstairs, and they tell you they don't have what you  need.  Oh, I know.  Do you just have any computers?  No, we don't.  Nothing.  We're expecting some in.  When?  I don't know.  Thanks.  Thank you.  All right.  I guess I'll come back here.  Do you have the iPhone 5?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  Forget it.  Yeah.  I bought a speaker from them that was a dud.  Why?  Was it really good?  Well, a little iPhone.  For the shower?  One of those things.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be great.  Got great reviews.  What is it, like, a Wi-Fi speaker?  Yeah, you do that with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth action, so you can listen to tunes in the shower.  Sure, sure.  It doesn't fucking work.  Why?  And now we might have punched it, so now I don't know.  Oh, yeah, that probably.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to bring it back, because now I've got to explain  why it's dented.  It's never good to go, this doesn't work, and they see a big dent on us. 
[00:22:00]  Were you all mad, wet, and nude, punching the speaker in the shower?  Your pubes were matted over the shaft of your penis.  Your fist was all sore when the speaker printed it.  Sure can paint a picture.  Nude.  So now I'm out a few.  Yeah.  A few Hyundai's.  Maybe I'll try to return it.  Maybe they won't notice.  Yeah.  It's soap caked in. 
[00:22:30]  No, it looks brand new.  Yeah.  Just a slight dent.  Yeah.  I'll just go, I don't know, it came this way.  I'll try that.  Is that the thing Bob gave us for Christmas?  He gave me some shitty wine.  He didn't give me that.  Oh, he gave me some weird little speaker thing.  You didn't get anything.  No, he gave me the nice little basket of, like, chocolates and crackers and cookies.  No, I got shitty middle-of-the-road wine.  Middle-of-the-road.  I looked it up.  I guess business has been dropping for him. 
[00:23:00]  He knows not to send me wine.  He used to send a nice bottle.  Now it's like it's just middle-of-the-road.  I could tell he had that discussion.  Like, oh, well, you know, something nice, but not too nice.  And he laughed nervously.  Right.  Just middle-of-the-road, shitty wine.  I think we threw it in a stew or something.  Use it as cooking wine.  Oh, that's great.  He doesn't even know I don't even really drink wine anymore. 
[00:23:30]  That's how out of touch he's been.  Every time I like my wine.  Nice, solid bottle of it, but not so much these days.  But it's the thought that counts, right, guys?  Of course it is.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  That's exactly what it's about.  He gave me a little mini speaker.  It looks like a coffee cup, but tall.  Like, you know the new Apple hard drive that's, what's it called?  The fucking core?  It's this new giant, it looks.  The computer?  The computer.  It's a very small version of that.  It's just a speaker.  Yeah.  It's this little black cylindrical speaker that I think operates on Wi-Fi. 
[00:24:00]  It's pretty cool looking.  How many times have you shoved it up your ass?  It literally is there now.  Why do you think I'm sitting with my legs sticking straight out while we're broadcasting?  I was wondering.  If I bend my legs too much, my back comes up, so I have to sit straight out.  All right.  I know.  I can't let it go, Jim.  We heard you.  Well, well, well.  We've got to do the Wendy Williams thing, because now it's a thing.  It's a thing.  We had this clip for three days, and now it's kind of going viral.  It's a thing. 
[00:24:30]  It has now become a thing.  Would she get all pissy-eyed?  Yeah.  Wendy Williams, she does a good talk show.  So, she's pretty damn good at it.  A certified success, as far as that.  Radio gal, moving over to TV.  A big success.  I just can't get over how monstrous she is.  She's a big gal.  But she's in proportion, though, for the most part.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Although her boobies are ridiculously over the top. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  But she's just large all around, but you wouldn't call her fat.  She's just a monster.  She's a big girl.  And she was talking about the Madonna thing.  Yeah, that's her in a bikini.  She's very entertaining, too.  Which isn't bad, but if you put that in perspective, she's a giant.  That's crazy.  She's a giant.  She's not fat, though.  She's just a big fucking person.  You don't really see any fat on there.  No.  But she calmed down her stupid hair.  When she first started her talk show, her hair was so ridiculous. 
[00:25:30]  The wigs.  Right.  A bunch of wigs.  She's calmed that shit down.  But she was talking about Madonna calling her son the N-word.  What did she say?  And thank God she called the white son the N-word.  Right.  They would take away the black ones if she said that.  You think?  What did she say?  Oh, yeah.  Something nigga.  She said it with an A, and she didn't say that.  It was the hashtag.  Dis nigga.  Oh, dis nigga.  Dis nigga.  Is that a hashtag?  I'm sorry.  Is that a hashtag that was going around, or no?  That's like, yeah.  That's like one of the go-to hashtags.  But she, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  But she meant it lovingly.  Of course she did.  Yeah.  But she did.  I know.  It's just funny.  Of course she did.  I don't think she was literally, yeah.  It's not a negative hashtag.  No.  But she tends to be a brave lady, so she should have just, you know, went with it.  Yeah.  But she apologized quickly.  Did she apologize for Catholicism when she offended them with the crucifix thing?  No.  No.  Of course not.  She didn't apologize.  She deleted it.  Oh.  But then she replaced it with hashtag, something to the effect of, hashtag, haters need to get  off my dick.  Oh. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Oh, she's embarrassing herself.  She's got to get off.  She's a woman of a certain age.  Yeah.  She's like, what?  55?  Cut the shit.  Yeah, really.  All right.  So then Wendy Williams was talking about this, and then, well, it turned a little bit.  Hey, what happened?  Hey, what?  Madonna posted a picture.  Madonna!  Madonna!  Madonna! 
[00:27:00]  It's always bothered me, her New York accent.  Madonna!  She's excited.  Yeah.  But it's like this over-ponunciation.  Because I don't want it.  People are going to know I'm from New York.  Madonna!  Every syllable is as loud as possible.  Oh, my God.  So she can get past the accent.  Madonna!  Yeah, she really did yell that out.  Listen again.  Posted a picture.  I'll go back.  I got to hear Madonna.  Madonna.  Madonna posted a picture of her on Rocco boxing. 
[00:27:30]  And the caption was, Mama said, Knocked you out.  Hashtag dis N-word.  Oh.  No, it wasn't N-word.  Dis N-word.  Listen to the audience.  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Fucking calm down!  The worst.  Calm down!  Has she interviewed rappers?  Wendy Williams?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So has she ever sat around?  And I know she's not attacking Madonna.  But has she ever sat a rapper down and said, Hey, this is Jay-Z.  He said, nigga. 
[00:28:00]  And he...  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Fucking...  Ooh!  Dumb audience.  Ah, fucking stupid audience.  Shut up.  I wonder if she was told that she can't actually say the word.  She must have been.  I'm sure.  Because she...  I mean, on a radio show, she would say all kinds of shit.  Yeah, right.  So she...  I don't know if I blame her on this one.  It's probably...  It's probably the parent company.  No, I don't blame her at all.  I just...  The parent company said we don't say the N-word here.  The parent company.  I hate that.  Boy, it was unwelcome.  Oh, the parent company.  We've had to deal with the parent company over the years. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, God.  They always...  The parent company is never fun.  Oh, God.  The parent company.  No.  I don't blame her at all.  I blame...  Like, I'm...  What gets me is the dumb audience.  Oh!  They're gasping.  They're literally like...  Huh?  Huh?  They gasped.  Gasped.  Right.  And then half of them will say the word about 20 times before they get to their bus.  Oh, yeah.  On the way home.  Please.  Or at least...  I kept...  Jacked hypocrites.  Hashtag, dis, N-word. 
[00:29:00]  Ugh.  In other words, this N-word.  Uh-huh.  Now, first of all, I want you to know that Rocco and his mother...  Can you pause that for a second?  Rocco is 13 years old, and Rocco...  That's kind of deceiving, though, because...  I know, right.  Because it's nigga.  I know.  This nigga is different than fucking the N-word, which...  It's way different.  Which...  Yeah.  So now it makes it sound like she's actually saying, you know...  Yeah, yeah.  A word that supposedly pisses off black people, even though they say it to themselves a million  times.  Only when white people say it.  Oh, whatever.  I don't...  Exactly.  I don't get it.  I don't either. 
[00:29:30]  But there is a difference there for Madonna.  Of course, there is.  Yeah.  There's a major drop-off between the two words.  You've got to clarify.  Right.  It means something totally different.  Yeah.  I mean, this is the amount of people hashtagging that at this moment.  Oh, yeah.  Look.  Tons.  I mean, it's just...  It's hashtagged all the time.  Yeah.  It's a regular...  It's a regular hashtag.  And we're like, what's the time between those posts?  This is one hour ago, one hour ago, three hours ago.  This is all today.  Yeah.  This morning.  People love saying nigga. 
[00:30:00]  Dis nigga.  Dis.  Yeah.  First of all, I want you to know that Rocco and his mother...  Dude.  Rocco's 13 years old, and Rocco is a real fan of his mother.  And what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore.  And then the audience gets going.  That's horrific.  That's horrific. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, I love it.  You can't cry on TV.  No.  You can act like a man.  Fuck.  Fuck America.  It's actually out of nowhere, wasn't it?  We weren't talking about your son.  Well, she might have had something happen that day.  Well, we're going to find out.  Could you go back to the big reveal, please?  Of course.  Please.  Oh, I love it.  Yep. 
[00:31:00]  Please, go back to the big reveal.  And Rocco is a real fan of his mother.  And what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Weird audience she's got.  Yeah, really sadistic.  Just stop whining. 
[00:31:30]  I hate you.  So, is this just right?  There's nothing better than somebody crying on TV.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Do you want to hear how she reacted to the Madonna thing again?  Yeah.  I didn't catch that.  Oh, hold on.  Maybe.  Let me see.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:32:00]  And Rocco is a real fan of his mother.  And what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore.  Be more funny.  Why not?  This is great.  Why not?  Why not?  Oh, God. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, my God.  It's wonderful.  Oh, that came out of, like, nowhere.  Yeah.  15 years old.  And Rocco is a real fan of his mother.  And what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore.  You know what it is.  I know what it is.  What?  What'd she say?  Kevin.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Can you go back to the video? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I didn't hear it.  Yeah, I couldn't catch it.  Yeah, I didn't catch it.  You guys keep interrupting it for sure.  Please.  I'm sorry.  He's a real fan of his mother.  And what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore.  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  You are never to blame. 
[00:33:30]  You suck!  Oh, um, right.  Did you catch what she said?  Not really.  I'm sorry.  If you go back there.  You know, the rewind. 
[00:34:00]  I'm 15 years old.  And Rocco is a real fan of his mother.  And, um, what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore.  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Stop talking and start sucking.  It's so mean.  You blew it! 
[00:34:30]  Oh, God.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  Oh, yeah.  My son doesn't like me.  Why not?  Why not?  Well, hold on.  Hold on a second.  Sorry.  I'm just thinking over some stuff over here.  I feel like you guys are not getting the proper context of the clip.  Why?  I'll replay it. 
[00:35:00]  Rocco's 13 years old, and Rocco is a real fan of his mother.  And, um, what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore.  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm gonna do is punch your mama in the mouth.  You're gonna be okay!  What did, uh, what's that clip?  I, I, I, you guys gotta, yeah, listen.  Sorry. 
[00:35:30]  Rocco's 13 years old, and Rocco is a real fan of his mother.  And, um, what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore.  He said, I can smell your cunt.  Why?  Rocco?  Terrible.  Why did he say that?  Why would he say that?  That's why he doesn't like her.  Oh.  Oh.  He said that to his mom?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  What?  Oh, that's just awful. 
[00:36:00]  Turd!  Turd, turd!  Why not?  Why, why not?  Can I make, can I make a request for why not?  Uh.  All right, let's.  Now that we know we're doing it, it's still in here.  Let's hear the clip.  Let's hear it.  Yeah, let's finally hear it.  For real.  Fine, okay.  Okay, all right.  Enough of the games.  Yes, please.  Okay.  It was very serious.  He's 13 years old, and Rocco is a real fan of his mother.  And, um, what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore. 
[00:36:30]  Why not?  That, that's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Uh.  That's terrible.  What are you doing in my house?  Let's be your son.  Yeah.  Stop it!  Shut up!  Stop whining.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[00:37:00]  Wow, Wendy is, uh, very upset.  What, Wendy?  What happened?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Feast audience member.  Hmm, yeah.  All right.  Well, let's see why.  Let's, let's really.  Yes.  Enough, enough fooling around.  I think we should see why.  Enough of this palaver.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  That Rocco and his mother.  Rocco's 13 years old, and Rocco is a real fan of his mother.  And, um, what I discovered this weekend is my son doesn't like me anymore.  Oh.  You know how it is.  I know what it is.  I don't have my period.  Kevin, I discovered, I discovered this a while ago, but the ball just got smacked home this  weekend.  You know, he's all into his father.  You know how 13-year-olds are?  I was the same way when I was 13, but it is breaking my heart. 
[00:38:00]  Anyway, she's lucky that he likes her.  Oh, God, yuck.  Oh, God, yuck.  Oh, yuck.  A bunch of hens.  Oh, yuck.  Wow.  Fuck it.  I'm trying to get love from the audience like that.  That's a little unfair to do to your son, too, when he's 13, to publicly put him on blast  like that.  I don't think, as they say.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone really cares about their parents at 13. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, that's unfair.  That's kind of manipulative to publicly say it.  It is.  Yeah, it's like, what are you doing?  Ugh, yuck.  He's 13.  And it sounds like it's just regular 13-year-old boy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  It doesn't sound like there's any real issue or anything.  My dad's cold, my mom fucking, you know, does this fucking show where she yaps with  dumb women.  Right.  And my mom has no time for me because she, you know, has to worry about her fucking TV  show.  I wonder what he did over the weekend that really smacked it home. 
[00:39:00]  I don't know.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  I heard that he went with his father to just do fun fucking manly shit.  That sounds like shit you do, yo.  Yeah.  That's what I read.  His dad's probably talking to him about chicks, and she's probably saying, what do you get  married?  And his father's like, oh, you gotta get blown, son.  Oh.  You know.  Yuck.  She really came apart at the seams.  Oh, the audience, though.  What?  Oh, my God.  Do tell. 
[00:39:30]  It just seems unfair.  It's like when fucking, you didn't hear a clamor like that when fucking, like, Bobby  Kennedy announced that Martin Luther King was dead.  It wasn't even, you heard like, oh.  Right.  That's, oh, oh, your son doesn't like you.  Oh, my God.  Relax.  Add that clip to our crying folder.  I don't even know which other ones we have in there.  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm trying to remember if we have any other. 
[00:40:00]  I think we're at them.  Somebody else has.  Yeah, I'm not sure if we have some.  I haven't heard people cry before.  Someone crying.  I'm trying to remember.  Like a public figure.  I'm thinking they might have been at one time, but.  Because there's an 18-year-old brother dating Ohio.  What?  With two very bad knees.  Yeah?  Oh, no.  And a dream to become a major league baseball player.  Uh-oh.  Too bad it didn't happen.  No.  He didn't make it.  Sucks.  I beg God his dream came true. 
[00:40:30]  What?  Does anybody remember last year?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, no.  Which one do you want to do next?  We haven't done the wrestling one in a while.  Yeah.  Oh, that guy.  Did you ever see his web redemption on Tosh?  No.  It's pretty fucking good.  They have like the Million Dollar Man and Coco Beware come on. 
[00:41:00]  It's really funny.  Tosh can get some people to do his little bits.  Well, the show's a bit popular, you know.  Yeah.  And it's just the Million Dollar Man and Coco Beware.  Oh, true.  Yeah.  You reckon he got Nixon to come on?  That's true.  And Tosh is dressed as the Ultimate Warrior.  Because it's a wrestling ring, but it's in the middle of an empty room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So like Tosh is acting like he's impressing a crowd.  There's nobody there.  There's no one there. 
[00:41:30]  He does a pretty good Ultimate Warrior, though.  What happened?  What was the sound?  There it is.  He's in an empty room, so there's no sound.  And the fat guy's just sitting in the middle of the ring in a chair.  Right.  And Tosh is just going back and forth between the ropes, dressed as the Ultimate Warrior.  And the guy's just looking at him like he's fucking a weirdo.  It's still real to me.  It's still real to me, damn it.  Yeah, it's that guy.  Do they play the original clip?  They probably do, right? 
[00:42:00]  I don't know.  How are you, Dave?  And now he sits down.  Can you believe where you're from?  Yes, Daniel.  I'm from...  Please call me the Ultimate Warrior.  I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.  You know where I'm from?  Parts Unown?  Parts Unown!  He's shaking their eyes.  He's shaking their eyes.  It's kind of a visual, but...  Man, what does that mean?  Stuff like maintenance, janitorial accounts, stuff like that.  Did any of your employees see that video? 
[00:42:30]  I've had a few bring it to my attention.  And what do they say?  It's just Dave.  What can you do?  You think Caren Anderson's a pussy?  I bet they said that.  No, I do not.  Caren Anderson's a pussy.  I'd like to get a few minutes in the ring with him.  Caren, if you're watching, what exactly were you attending?  I was attending something called the Tribute to Starrcade in Spartanburg, South Carolina.  Oof.  How'd you get some seats?  Sounds awful.  I walked in there and bought a ticket.  Where was it held at?  It was held in Spartanburg, South Carolina, at the Coliseum. 
[00:43:00]  That was in a Coliseum?  Yes.  That looked like a middle school.  Yeah.  How many people attended that?  I would have no idea.  Ballpark, was there hundreds or was there 50?  He didn't run anymore after that, so obviously he didn't do too well.  Is Brooke Hogan a man?  I follow the sun that gives me energy.  The warrior.  The warrior.  Why did you get so emotional?  It was just an emotional time. 
[00:43:30]  I got to meet some of my favorite wrestlers and just get all caught up with them.  Did you ever masturbate to Miss Elizabeth?  Never.  Not at all.  She died.  Drug overdose.  What were some of the rumors that you read about yourself?  That I was sitting in my mama's basement eating Cheetos in my underwear.  Which is not true because mom and dad never had a basement.  I'm not really big into Cheetos and everything.  You don't like Cheetos?  No. 
[00:44:00]  Doritos?  Doritos are good.  Do you know that wrestling is fake?  Regardless of whether it's predetermined or not, they may have a great sacrifice to their  bodies in the rain.  I don't know that about it.  Do you know how to reverse the figure four leg lock?  Uh, yes, I do.  Let me slap that figure four leg lock.  I think I put it on.  I think I put it on.  And he puts him in a figure four.  You're going to reverse it?  You're going to reverse?  All right, Dave, I am a huge wrestling fan just like you. 
[00:44:30]  Unlike you, I'm extremely rich and I need a tax shelter.  So I've created a charity in your name to honor past wrestling greats.  Now he's in like a Piper's Pit set.  We are backstage live at Tosh's Pit.  With me is the crying wrestling fan, Dave.  Dave, the world wants to know, are you ready to award the first ever recipient of the bronze 
[00:45:00]  singlet?  Yes, I am.  Are you ready to do it without sobbing like a huge baby?  Yes, I am.  All right, take it away, Dave.  With his colorful outfits and trusty Pit Perk Frankie, Coco Beware was a fixture in pro  wrestling for over a decade.  It is a great privilege that we honor him with the bronze singlet charity award.  Bronze singlet.  Ladies and gentlemen, Coco Beware. 
[00:45:30]  That's really Coco.  Coco.  He's doing his Birdman, just like slapping his wings.  It's my pleasure to present you with the bronze singlet charity award.  Oh my God.  Thank you.  Coco Beware.  Personal note, it's still real to me, damn it.  It's still real to me, damn it.  I know that laugh.  That is a million dollar man. 
[00:46:00]  What am I doing here, Coco Beware?  I'm here to claim my war.  Tuxedo with the money signs.  With the money signs.  Where's Virgil?  Virgil should have, oh man.  This is Mean Gene Tosh, and this looks like it's spilling over into the ring.  Now they're just having a wrestling match, and I guess we're okay there.  Now Tosh is just having fun on this show.  Yeah, now Tosh just has fun.  He does seem to have a lot of fun on that show. 
[00:46:30]  It is a very good show, obviously.  He doesn't do anything unusual.  And he pressed, does he?  I never see him on any interviews.  No, we gave up trying to get him on our show.  So, yeah, certainly we'd like him on.  They're always asking.  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  Yeah, what do I do?  He doesn't even acknowledge that the listeners even say it.  No.  He's doing just fine, I guess.  All right.  Why don't we eat?  Yes, we got food.  And we'll get into some other things.  Thanks.  Don't forget, Jimmy's going to Atlanta today. 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  Me.  And my third Borgata show is on sale now for Saturday, the 15th, 10.30, late show.  And, of course, the O&A podcast.  Let's not forget about that.  Podcast number 37.  Yes, Jimmy Hates Animals.  Oh.  That one's doing great.  Oh, it's not that one.  Jimmy Hates Animals was 36, and it's still doing great.  And the new one is the interviews we did with Ice Cube and Jerry Springer.  Need proof?  Listen to this 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio jam.  Hello. 
[00:47:30]  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  No, this is the wrong Bill.  Uh, well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Uh, Bill, uh, Bill died today.  Yeah, kid, oh my God.  Yeah.  It's tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Mm-hmm.  Who is this? 
[00:48:00]  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did it happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love him.  Yeah, big, big, big pile up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences. 
[00:48:30]  Okay.  Well, I gotta go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Welcome back to the O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  You can put your penis away, miss.  Jesus, that one was brutal.  That one was a brutal, uh, look back there, Anthony. 
[00:49:00]  Yes, pill.  Pill.  Karma got me in the end on that one, so.  I don't know if I can do that today.  I'm being completely honest.  I don't know if I can do that.  That call's about...  I'm not justifying.  I'm just giving facts here.  Uh, it's about 15 years old.  Well, you could...  And I got that exact same phone call for real, so karma did get me on that. 
[00:49:30]  You could say karma gets you, like, because we've done so many, like, despicable things.  We could all say that.  I could say that.  Right.  We all...  I got that exact phone call when I was in Boston, yeah.  That my parents were in a car accident, so I think...  Jesus.  I think someone was like, you know what, we can't let this one slide, motherfucker.  Oh, boy.  So, all you haters out there, there you go.  Karma got me.  Have a good laugh at that.  Have a field day.  Yeah, have fun.  Yeah.  So, wow, I don't know. 
[00:50:00]  I swear, I don't know if I can do that one.  Yeah, that's a little more rough.  Oh, we were young and full of cum.  Yeah, the hang-up the other day, that was easy still.  Full of piss and vinegar.  The hang-up on that guy was easy.  I could still do that.  Yeah.  Because I know he's a fan of the show, and I know, in the end, he's completely fine with it.  Supposedly, he wrote me on Twitter, but I'm not sure if someone was just, you know, playing that guy.  Yeah.  Saying, you know, I was completely cool with that.  I thought it was hilarious. 
[00:50:30]  I bet he was.  But I don't know.  I don't know if it was someone just, you know, faking there with the guy.  You never know with the Twitter, so.  The Twitter.  Why Rush?  I'll figure out why Rush.  Someone's going to be a lot older than they should be, no?  Unless an album came out many, many years ago.  There was no reason?  No reason.  I like the no reason.  You just felt like, because you rushed that cat out of your house?  Yes.  Without giving him a chance of that survival? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  The poor thing was beaten, and it fucking hisses at Sissy Boy once, and it picks it out in the fucking 8 degree weather.  Ah, shit.  You're a scumbag.  I have zero tolerance.  Oh, man.  Thomas was trying to do the right thing, and take a rescue in.  They're called rescues.  Rescue.  Is that a rescue dog?  That's a big thing now, man.  If you've got, like, some of those special breeds, who was just talking about this?  Oh, it's, uh, wow, okay. 
[00:51:30]  Seth Meyers on Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.  Yeah.  You love that title.  With Jerry Seinfeld?  Yes.  The Seth Meyers one, I guess he has one of those miniature greyhounds, I think he was talking about?  Oh, yeah, okay.  And supposedly, if you have that breed of dog, and you don't say that it's a rescue, fucking people get pissed.  Oh, like if you buy one?  Yeah, they get pissed off.  And I think he tells the story, maybe you could find this, Sam Roberts, where he had to tell Martha Stewart that it was a rescue, 
[00:52:00]  because he was too scared to tell her that they went to a breeder.  Of course.  And then she's like, oh, from where?  And I forgot.  I think he said Missouri.  He came up with some state that was hard to, like, you know, really track if it was true or not.  You put your hand over your mouth and go.  Seth Meyers.  Great dream, Bill.  Yeah.  Great dream.  It's when they're sitting down, Sam, which, you know, with this comedians in cars getting coffee, they finally sit down way later in the episode.  I'm sorry. 
[00:52:30]  I mean, fucking Travis tried.  Four-year-old cat.  Right.  Four years of somebody else's fucking abuse.  Right.  When I decided to get the wonderful little Beavis, I went to a breeder, paid money, got a fucking kitten, and trained him to be the wonderful, adorable kitten that he is.  And Travis, you know.  I'll try again.  Oh, boy.  You're going to get another cat?  You're going to go a little, you're going to try to get, like, a kitten? 
[00:53:00]  Well, no, I don't have the money to get it.  Oh, Travis.  That's part of the reason we're adopting one.  But there are people that just give away kittens, aren't there?  Yeah, and look at what that got me the first time.  We're not just going to go to some place that, you know.  Well, but, but I mean, that's a four-year-old cat.  Oh, you mean, like.  Four-year-old cats are set in their ways.  I don't know many people that actually give away kittens.  And what was the issue?  After one day, he wouldn't let you get out of the bathroom, basically?  He just turned on me and wanted to kill me every time he saw me.  He turned on me.  He wanted to kill you.  And his little cat eyes, I bet you that's, he was convinced he could take you down. 
[00:53:30]  I was whoever used to beat him.  Yeah, you probably looked like the other owner that used to, like, fucking, I will end you!  Right.  Like that guy.  Oh, the guy that yells at cats.  Yeah, you probably like him, so, you know.  Oh, poor guy.  So, he had to go back.  He had to go back.  Get the fuck out of my house.  What are his odds if you bring him back?  Oh, bring him back? 
[00:54:00]  Oh, boy.  The old, the old gas chamber.  You go to the bottom of the list, right?  I'm going to shoot that dog!  Like Petey.  Remember when they put Petey from The Little Rascals in the gas chamber?  And Stimey's like, I got the $5.  The Lord sent it to me.  Please let Petey out.  And he's like, he's like, it's too late!  And the gas, he was already, like, gassing him.  And he opened up the gas chamber.  Right.  And then Petey was in there.  All right. 
[00:54:30]  And then Petey fucking runs after the guy in fast motion.  At the end.  How do you know the music?  I bet you that's the exact music, so.  Breaking news, too.  Oh.  Yep.  What?  Oh, that?  It's breaking news.  Justin Bieber arrested for drag racing.  DUI in Miami Beach.  This kid is such a fucking loser.  He's on the road to Leif Garrett. 
[00:55:00]  He's a perfect fucking parallel to the Leif Garrett.  What about the people around him?  What the fuck?  They don't care.  They're getting fucking free ride.  Like, Hammers, Cassie and stuff.  I think he's just trying to fucking change his image from cute little boy.  And he's just trying to...  Be just a badass.  Yeah.  A badass.  Oh, my sister wants to chime in.  Yeah.  She goes, fuck rescue.  Looking at puppies Saturday.  She had an episode this past week where she went to... 
[00:55:30]  She had dogs for...  Two dogs for fucking years and years and years.  Right.  And then they finally die off.  And she's like, I'm done with that.  Right.  So after a little while now, she's decided, maybe I want another dog.  Right.  So one of her dogs was a Shizu, Shih Tzu, and she decided to, you know, check one out for  rescue.  So she goes, she puts it on her lap, and she's petting it, and it's like, oh, it's getting  along pretty nicely.  She's really considering taking it. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  And she goes to, like, move it to put it to...  And the thing latches onto her finger and just fucking...  She got to go to the hospital and get a shot.  So she's like, fuck rescue.  I'm getting a puppy.  If I worked in one of those rescue places, I'd give the dogs a, you know...  A kick in the liver?  Well, a little taste of the Xanax or something to keep them all nice and calm.  Oh, while the people are there, they're all just...  They're all fucking spaced out and nice. 
[00:56:30]  He's so, like, relaxed.  You know how many dogs I'd be able to move?  Yeah.  You've got to do it properly.  You've got to move them through.  Yeah.  And then these dogs, you know, wake up from the Xanax or whatever the fuck.  You slip them.  Yeah, yeah.  Then they become the monsters they truly are.  Cheap fabric and dim lighting.  That's how you move merchandise.  Yeah, it's...  When you're picking up someone else's problem, you've got to be like...  I knew a few people that were, like, rescue people.  They...  And they jump in. 
[00:57:00]  They don't care how bad the animals behave.  Their whole goal is to give it a home and help it.  But for the average Joe that's just trying to get an animal?  Sure.  See, this is...  And we explained this over the years.  You know, this directly affects me.  My brother is all in with rescue.  Right.  All in.  One of his dogs has, like, a leg that's a little too short.  It doesn't work.  Another...  He has a cat with one eye.  Oh, Jesus.  Like, he goes...  He goes deep into rescue.  Right.  He goes for the ones that have no fucking chance. 
[00:57:30]  Does he have one of those that have two wheels strapped to its ass?  Walk around like...  He probably does.  Like that.  The little wheelie dog.  Every time I go over there, I see eyes under couches and stuff.  Or one.  He goes...  I go, how many are you up to?  He goes, I don't know.  Five or six cats.  Oh.  A couple dogs.  Oh, boy.  And then they bring in others.  Other, like, kittens and stuff for a while.  And then they...  I don't know.  I guess they give them a home for a little bit.  And then they bring them back for adoption or something like that.  Just tease them with love and then remove it. 
[00:58:00]  And then take it away.  Right.  So as much as I'm beating the shit out of the whole thing, someone very close to me is all in with that.  I just don't have that.  I like the idea of raising a little animal, a puppy or a kitten, in your own fashion so it loves you and will play with you and not be scared and hiding under a couch.  Or if you have a lot of space, too.  Well, yeah.  Have a nice little field in the back and stuff.  If you have one of these nightmare animals, I could...  Yeah.  You know.  Around the yard. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, they could be outside a little bit more.  Do you know when I pull up to my home, when I get home after doing the show, little Beavis is standing up in the window, meowing at me coming home.  He's hoping anyone has bought the home.  He's hoping it's a realtor.  Aw.  Little Beavis.  Do you know, I have a neighbor who I see on the elevator, and he's got like three pit bulls, and they're all rescues.  Right.  And they're really nice dogs. 
[00:59:00]  They're big, and they jump on you, but they're scary, because it's like with a pit bull rescue, you never fucking know who I am.  Yeah, we're mostly making jokes.  There are people that are very happy with their rescues.  Yeah, but it freaks me out, though.  I would assume they're very happy.  Fuck.  Yeah, you don't know what the fuck that thing's had to deal with.  Or what will set it off.  Right, what will set it off.  Right.  I don't know.  This is anti-climatic, I guess, but here's the Seth Meyers clip from Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee with Jerry Seinfeld.  I love this fucking web series. 
[00:59:30]  It's good, man.  I like it a lot.  I'm out of episodes, unfortunately.  Aw.  Has Todd Barry been on?  I think his is like today.  Okay.  I'm waiting for the latest one, which I think is today.  It's Todd Barry.  There are times where I'm like, listen, I would eat this.  Only like two things would have to go wrong in my day.  You got the greyhound as a puppy?  Yeah.  You know, they have rescues with those because of the racing and all that.  We didn't do that.  We did everything wrong.  The day we bought it, we ran into Martha Stewart. 
[01:00:00]  And she was like, where did you get it?  Oh, God.  Got a slide through her face.  We got it from a breeder.  She was like, oh, where?  It was like, Missouri.  They're trying to think of what is the state Martha Stewart is least likely to know dog  breeders.  Missouri.  There you go.  Yeah.  It's not today and iconic now, but.  No, that's, people do get fucking pissy when you tell them you bought something.  People like, yeah, with my cat, they're like, was this a rescue?  Right.  You don't get these rescued. 
[01:00:30]  They're a trendy fucking animal.  They're for the fancy people.  Yeah.  They're trendy.  I tell people whenever I have a new kitten, they're like, where'd you get?  That I'm like, well, I just, I took them from the mother and then I drowned all of the  siblings in a gunny sack.  Oh, shit.  And then I fucked, I fucked the mother kit while we watched and then threw her in front  of a train.  That really annoys them.  That really gets them, I think.  Then I just go, I'm just joshing.  Oh, joking.  Let's say hi to Jay in Tampa, Jay.  OB, go back to BAB with your brother. 
[01:01:00]  All I wanted to say was, whoo, whoo, whoo, Robin, you're ripping me off with the cat rescue.  Okay.  What?  Good.  Two bombs.  Anything else?  Two bombs.  No waiting.  Well, the first one, he was being nice.  Was he?  He said, I go back to BAB with you.  Oh, I thought he said, go back to BAB.  Fuck you, Sam.  He's heard it my way, too.  I totally meant to say.  What you thought he said, because it's exactly what I heard.  Hey, OB, go back to BAB.  BAB with your brother.  With your brother. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He goes, hey, OB, I go back to BAB with your brother.  Right.  With you, brother.  I understand now, but I heard it the exact same way I heard it.  I heard, go back to BAB with your brother.  That's exactly what I thought.  Which makes sense.  So I apologize.  All right.  All right.  That was it.  Can we replay it?  But it did sound like that.  I thought he said it too.  Look how defensive me and OB are.  Well, because we hear.  I heard him say, go fuck yourself.  I absolutely heard it that way.  That's what I heard.  And the other reason why I thought he said it that way, my brother never did radio with  me at BAB.  So I go back to you. 
[01:02:00]  I go back to BAB with your brother.  I go back to BAB with your brother.  Oh, but I heard with your brother.  That's what I heard.  Oh, okay.  I heard not.  Look, I know.  Go back to BAB with your brother.  Look, I know I'm wrong, but I definitely heard it the other way.  And so I knew I heard it that way too.  Hey, Kat Hitler might have heard it too.  Kat Hitler.  I apologize to that guy.  Thank you.  I don't know if you should be doing that.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  We haven't gotten to it yet.  What?  Let's hear.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear the clip.  OB, go back to BAB with your brother.  Yep.  With you.  Go back to BAB with your brother.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, OB, go back to.  Oh, he's saying.  I go back to BAB.  But he said it like, hey, OB, go back to BAB with your brother.  With your brother.  Yeah.  Okay.  No, no.  He should have worded it better.  He's just trying to be casual.  He's an asshole.  That's how we talk on the job site.  Guy calls up.  Hey, what are you doing?  Go way back with you.  Hey, I see you got a honey bun in there.  All right.  You take care.  If the wife don't want me to eat all of it, what do I do? 
[01:03:00]  All right.  I hear it his way now.  But, oh, wait.  Fuck that.  Breaking in, too.  I heard it, too.  It's a trouble that starts getting in.  And, you know, people do think this is a very serious offense.  I've given these charges here.  Drag-wise, drag racing while drunk is no joke.  Nice.  It's certainly different than acting out.  Tori Dunnett, thanks for staying on.  Good.  If he wants to be a fucking badass, now fucking really do something about this.  Oh, they should throw him in Gen Pop.  But he's one of those upper celebrities, so, you know, nothing will happen.  Oh, it'll just be like... 
[01:03:30]  If you or me or anyone around here fucking was drag racing...  Oh, forget it.  ...drunk, holy fuck, we'd be in real trouble.  He'll have to do some kind of community service thing or make a PSA or something.  But as far as, you know, any inconvenience to his life whatsoever, no.  Titles.  Meteorologist is one of them.  I'm going to have you join me.  You can see everyone else has.  We're going to fill this sheet out by the end of the season.  I promise you that.  But let's talk about it.  I don't even know what it is. 
[01:04:00]  How many times have you been on sex?  How many times have you been...  You can't tell.  You only get one and a half.  Why are they even concentrating on the smell anymore?  All right, let's talk about the cold air.  We know it's in place today.  Do we?  Do we know it's in place?  Cold air.  I know it's in place.  I guess we talked about the cold air, but not as...  It's fucking cold.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just talk about our experiences as this stupid beaver.  Drag racing and drunk.  That's good.  Were those text messages real, Sam?  I know you probably saw...  I know you're one of these entertainment fruits.  No, it was him and Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez going back and forth. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah?  I mean, I saw it on radar.  Right.  You know.  O'Reilly?  Who released them?  Selena?  No, I think they said one of Selena's friends.  The text messages?  Yeah.  I mean, there weren't photos of the text messages.  It was just text of what they said.  Right.  So it hasn't gone, you know, too crazy.  What was the gist?  I think nobody can...  It said, like...  If it was real, holy fuck.  Selena Gomez was telling him to go to rehab.  Oh.  Then he was like... 
[01:05:00]  He said, no, no, no?  That's right.  He probably said, I'd rather just sit by a fire and eat some fondue.  No.  You didn't like that line?  No.  You were wrong.  That's a great line.  It's terrible.  He called her pussy talentless.  Oh.  Wait, wait.  He called her pussy talentless?  Yeah, your talentless pussy.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  He called her vagina talentless?  Or he called her a pussy and said she's talentless?  Well, let's read them.  They're pretty good, actually.  I bet her pussy is very talented. 
[01:05:30]  Who knows?  Biebs has had his share.  Let's be honest.  We may not love him, but Biebs has had his share.  I don't care if she lays there like a corpse.  That would be great, yes.  I told her.  She was.  And then he just started randomly sending dick pics to her, according to the article.  So, yeah, read through them.  He's out of control.  How big is he?  So Justin Bieber says, baby, come on, I love you.  Should somebody act this out?  You know what?  You're not wrong.  Well, you know. 
[01:06:00]  You're not wrong.  You know?  Sam raises a damn good point.  I don't like just hearing guys read it.  I'd rather hear a guy who reminds me of Bieber because he has the stylish young hairdo.  That's true.  I'm not feeling it today.  Do I have to act out anything?  No.  No.  All right, Joe.  I think...  Who should play Justin?  Kenny.  Well, what if...  What if Kenny played Justin?  Yeah.  And then to play Selena Gomez...  Selena Nagel?  I don't disagree. 
[01:06:30]  What if we got somebody who we haven't had on...  A couple guys you guys could pick from.  Troy Kwan.  No.  He's not allowed to be on the air.  What?  That'll change very soon.  But there's two guys that we haven't heard from, I feel like, in years.  Dennis Falcone!  No.  No.  One is Iraq.  No.  One is Cell.  One is Tank Hankaris.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, one is the virus.  The virus.  Oh, what awful characters.  We gotta bring those back, but...  I don't know.  Not in this situation.  I mean, the virus playing Selena Gomez is... 
[01:07:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  He's here already.  Uh-oh.  Oh, go figure.  A Doctor Who shirt.  Wow, why'd you come in so...  Because this kid never says no.  That's why E-Rock's the best.  But he doesn't have to.  Is that a Doctor Who shirt, or...?  No, this is not.  What is that?  What childish fucking thing is that?  A Harry Potter shirt.  Yeah.  Okay.  You wear a Harry Potter shirt?  I didn't see the wand.  It's kind of cool, though, actually.  Compared to a Harry Potter shirt?  It's kind of cool compared to a face, a chin dildo.  Harry Pot roast.  You know, E-Rock just tickled my neck, and I thought it was my microphone. 
[01:07:30]  Yes.  Harry Potter.  E-Rock looks a little better, though.  Thank you.  You want to do a weigh-in today?  I guess, if you want to, yeah.  Yeah.  It's been about a week.  Wasn't he in about a week ago?  Yeah, we've done a weigh-in since then.  No, I know that.  Are we printing out these?  We should be.  We've got to print these out.  Yeah, I mean, I don't have...  Hey, Sal, print these out.  We should do a weigh-in, too. 
[01:08:00]  I agree.  There's a weigh challenge going on between Roland and Eric through Dr. Ian Smith.  Is he in contact with the guys officially?  I guess.  Like, he keeps...  He kept posting on Twitter that he hasn't heard from us, but I've responded to what he's  written.  On Twitter?  On Twitter.  Don't you have his phone number?  Well, I do, but he started posting on Twitter that he hasn't heard from either one of us,  so I wrote back, I'm writing to you right now, you know?  Right.  Oh, boy.  And then later, I don't... 
[01:08:30]  Fans are asking, what's going on?  He goes, I don't know.  They refuse to respond to me.  He doesn't...  And I said, I'm telling you, I'm doing okay.  I'm using your recipes.  He probably blocked you and doesn't remember.  He doesn't really care.  Yeah, I didn't want to hear from the Nagel kid.  He doesn't really care, Iraq.  Dr. Steve?  No, not at all.  Why would he?  Nah.  Nah.  I don't know if he's using his Twitter account or his people are using his Twitter account.  That's exactly it.  You think this whole thing is a cheap ploy for plugs?  Why don't you just call him?  And where are the blenders?  Yeah, man.  We haven't gotten any of the little snickety snacks. 
[01:09:00]  No.  We haven't gotten any of his blender.  I'm not the contestant you need to be addressing this way.  I know.  Oh, where's Roland?  Oh, Roland is a little...  Let's bring Roland down here.  I've got to be honest, Dr. Ian Smith, you should make sure you get this stuff to the guys.  It's important.  I thought the blenders were on their way.  They should have been here overnighted.  They should have been overnighted.  People are asking me what blender I use for my smooth.  They have been.  Oh, yeah.  And I've been holding out.  Because you want to, you know, give the guy a little favor here.  I would easily give Dr. Ian Smith a favor. 
[01:09:30]  But if he doesn't get that fucking blender to me pronto, I'm going to tell everyone what  fucking blender I use.  What?  What does the bottom look like?  Is that regular?  Pull your pants down.  No, but doesn't that just...  You make it in that, don't you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you put this cover on.  But the blender part goes into the top.  Oh, into it.  But the blender is pretty much this.  Oh, you guys got the blender for me, Ian?  No.  No.  Of course not.  Oh!  Roland, you're not happy with this contest, right? 
[01:10:00]  Well, I'm using it way because of my ninja blender, not because of his.  Oh!  Damn!  He fucked up, right?  Yeah.  Probably just a piece of shit, anyways.  Oh!  Wow.  This is the real...  Look at the Roland fan.  This is real Roland.  Yes, yes.  I went on the...  Have a snack at night time when you're hungry.  I like to.  Roland is probably joking.  Like, it's a fucking...  It's a huge change in his life.  And he would like to have a few of the comforts that Ian Smith had a run.  And he takes someone and goes, hey, where's the snacks?  Nothing. 
[01:10:30]  What are you saying in response?  It's like me texting you guys, do you want this guest?  Oh!  Well, some people get back to you.  I got back to you.  He gave us three bags.  That'd better.  He gave us three bags of potato chips for...  Or popcorn.  That's good.  Three bags of popcorn.  Popcorn took him.  Yeah.  Did he?  He took one.  For a staff of 12.  The fucking...  The crash victims in the movie Alive had more to eat.  No, they didn't.  In the book, it says you have any snack that's under 150 calories.  I'm like, how the fuck do...  I have to do math now? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  What's up, Iraq?  I'm hungry.  Hold on.  I got to put...  Iraq's trying to chime in over there.  Sorry.  This has been a big problem with going through the book and following the meal plans and  the diet, as Roland's pointing out here, is when it gets to the snack portion, it says  you're now at your first snack of the day.  Start off with...  And it's always his product, the snacks.  And then it says, or an equivalent that's 100 calories or less, or 150 calories or less.  Then you go to the back of the book and there's this huge glossary of things you can have. 
[01:11:30]  I don't have, but he likes to point out that everything that's listed there starts off  with his product and I don't have the snacks, I don't have the popcorn, so he throws a fit  every time.  I do Whole Foods and that's one of the special guys.  I'm like, hey dude, what do you eat?  He goes, well, let me take you over there.  So he gave me all this stuff, he gave me the vegetables and...  You'll find plenty of shit to eat.  I mean, the bottom line is, I don't eat Ian Smith stuff and you can do it, it's just a 
[01:12:00]  little more convenient if you have it.  Yeah, but the point is, Dr. Ian Smith was going to hold their hands.  Right, this is part of the whole thing.  Yeah, they could figure out all the ways to do this, but this whole thing started because  Dr. Ian Smith started this competition.  And the reason that it even started was because E-Rock was pissed that he didn't get his hand  held last time.  Right, right.  So he was like, no excuses, I'll hold your hand this time.  And we've pretty much forced Eric to, you know, get along with Dr. Ian Smith again.  But E-Rock, his point is being proven this time around, that Dr. Ian is dropping the 
[01:12:30]  fucking ball.  So I'm using the book that Bob Kelly recommended to me, the way he's losing weight.  Oh, wow.  And it's working.  Oh yeah, this is another thing.  That book has not left Roland's desk since last Wednesday.  Yeah, so I took Bobby Kelly's, the one they told me, tossed that book and kept Bob Kelly's  book.  So at least that tells me a plan.  So now we got like a competition between the actual weight loss programs. 
[01:13:00]  So that way I go, okay, I'm really hungry and I'm jonesing for like a pizza.  Then I flip and they go, well, you can do this.  I was like, oh, okay.  Since Dr. Ian Smith was here, so right now, what has Dr. Ian Smith done to help you lose  weight?  He promoted his book here.  So you haven't followed any of his?  He gave Eric $500.  So you haven't, you haven't followed, you haven't followed any of his?  Fuck him, no.  And how do they make it so it's okay to eat pizza in the other book?  Oh no, they didn't because it's like, um, they said you could create like a, like a chicken 
[01:13:30]  dish with, um, some of this, um, like you use pasta sauce, but no noodles to have chicken  and put tomato sauce over the chicken.  Something that might kind of get your palate for that.  Yeah, and it, it, it, it, it, it, it got the cravings on.  Right.  So I didn't crave pasta or anything, so I just had a baked chicken with a tomato sauce  over it.  Mmm.  This is why Ian should help these guys, because I know he's very busy and he's on the go,  but these are two guys who have a fucking addiction and they're both trying to do it.  And it's really hard.  It's a great promotional, I mean, he wants to promote too.  He said he would help these guys. 
[01:14:00]  It's not a one-way street, it's a great promotional vehicle for him.  Of course, don't forget, he said he would help these guys.  Right.  We didn't force Dr. Ian Smith to help these guys.  And boy, Eric didn't want, yeah, Eric didn't want anything to do with them.  No.  And we kind of, we forced Eric to go, look, he wants to help you, so fuck you.  You gotta, you gotta do this.  Also, Joe Cross from Fast and Nearly Dead, I text him, I go, I'm having a problem, because  he said you have a lot of fruit smoothies, and he goes, no, mate, if you have too much  fruit smoothies, you're going to gain the weight. 
[01:14:30]  You have to balance it 80-20, and he's sending recipes.  What's 80-20?  80 greens, 8% greens, 20% fruit.  Because he said if you do it the other way.  Wait, 80% greens.  Greens.  Drinking.  Of all the green juices and everything.  So spinach and kale and whatnot, cucumber.  He said don't fall for the trap of just drinking fruit smoothies.  Ian Smith gave you that tip?  No, Joe Cross from Fast and Nearly Dead.  Ah.  He was in Australia doing a book tour.  He called me, too.  He goes, call me wherever you need.  Wow.  Too much sugar is not good. 
[01:15:00]  I thought, let the fruit smoothies go.  But he said, I have all this fruit, and he said, if you have that every morning, he said  you'll lose weight and gain it the next week.  So he sent me a bunch of recipes of all greens.  So I followed Joe Cross's recipes.  So they're helping me.  Yeah.  Let's get them on the scale.  Now I'm curious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you got to add, Eric?  So none of the products, no blender.  I am following his daily layout of your food and your exercise and all that stuff and making 
[01:15:30]  the substitutions where I don't have his products based on his list in the back there and everything.  And I'm following it, like, to the T.  You are.  Minus the blender, which I had to go out and I got a Nutribullet.  You got a Nutribullet?  That's what I use.  I can't wait anymore, either.  I love my Nutribullet.  I've also found what Roland was saying with the fruit smoothies that are in his recipes.  Right.  If it has kale, there's a lot more fruit added to it.  So just to kill the taste, I guess.  Kale, brutal.  If it doesn't have kale, it's only, like, one fruit in the smoothie. 
[01:16:00]  Kale is really good for you, but it's rough.  Yes, I have.  That is rough.  You got to break it down with some pineapple juice and stuff.  Break it down.  I go to the Liquiteria and buy, like, a big green so I won't have the urge to buy popcorn.  Right.  I used to, every day, drink a giant vegetable juice.  It was, like, beets and fucking all this stuff.  And then I would have, like, a little bit of lemon in there and some ginger just for, like, to mix.  No vegetable, no fruit at all.  It was good, man.  I'd have to go to a restaurant with, to me, a friend.  I'd just drink, like, three protein ones. 
[01:16:30]  That's what Joe told me to do.  And then when you go, you're just so full, you're not tempted to order.  Right.  So that's what I do now.  What do you eat when you go there?  A little something?  Just a salad with oil and vinegar.  You're all in again, Roland.  A little chicken.  I'm very happy to hear this.  Because Joe Cross, like, the other ones helping me.  Before, I was like, I'd like to check this thing and go, screw it.  But you were at a really good place there for a while, man.  You lost a shitload of weight.  You were sleeping better.  Yeah.  And I think we all owe Iraq an apology.  I think so, too.  We tore him apart. 
[01:17:00]  For 5,000 things.  One for each film.  Slow down.  We'll give him one apology.  You don't think we owe him any one apology?  Awkward.  I've also found, too, that being new to kale and flaxseed really makes you shit.  Oh, boy, does it.  Whoa.  That never changes, by the way.  One of the days, I forgot what you say, one of the days where the meals were just the smoothies.  And there's a whole bunch of different recipes, so it's not the same one each time. 
[01:17:30]  But like I said, a lot of them involve kale.  And you're just constantly going.  Between that and all the water and everything, you're just shitting nonstop.  Dude, that vegetable juice would have me on the toilet.  I would take a fucking horrible liquid shit.  But I mean, it still felt good.  Oh, it did.  But then it starts to burn.  Yeah.  You know, because you went four times that day.  And you're just like, these adult wipes are not helping.  Oh, God. 
[01:18:00]  That is disgusting.  God.  I can't get my shit on 37.  So let's do a weigh-in today.  Yeah.  Let's see how the boys are doing.  And the scales here.  Last time we were getting an error, right?  Yeah.  Well, the last...  Hang on, Roland.  The last...  First, Roland started at 336.  336.  You don't look 336.  That's what's so strange to me.  And then we weighed him in two days later and got error message.  Error.  Didn't we get it down?  No.  We weren't really sure about that. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, no.  It was error.  I thought...  Okay.  Nope.  That's where we left it.  I thought we finally got something.  Nope.  All right.  All right.  Now he's going to step on up.  How do you reset it?  Reset the old scale.  Now he's stepping up on it.  All right.  Round and round she goes.  Where she stops.  They're looking at the numbers.  I think they're trying to calculate. 
[01:19:00]  There you go.  Roland.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  So just to set up, it's been about a week, right?  He was in...  About a week.  About a week.  Last Thursday he came in?  Yeah.  No Dr. Ian.  No Dr. Ian.  No help at all.  Roland wants the world to know no Dr. Ian Smith.  And how much has Roland lost in a week?  Roland is at 328.  Eight pounds.  Oh, eight pounds.  Eight pounds.  That's pretty goddamn good.  Pounds, baby.  Pounds. 
[01:19:30]  Eight pounds in a week.  That's great.  Yeah.  Jeez.  That's good.  Pretty good.  Now, we need to rock.  Mm-hmm.  You started at 247.  Jesus.  247.  When we weighed him two days later, it's at 240.  Uh-huh.  So we were all like, wow, that's impossible.  And maybe there was an error.  So we're going to see Eric.  Yep.  Eric's getting on the scale. 
[01:20:00]  His starting weight was 247.  A week later, he's at...  Do we have a shitty scale?  It's saying about 240.6.  So he's probably...  It keeps moving.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Went down to 239.  It is this scale.  So...  Maybe if you're on a rug, that might be...  Maybe it's moving a little bit.  Where are you?  240.4?  Yeah, it's 240.  So that could just be what he's wearing. 
[01:20:30]  So very...  Yeah, but he was wearing...  So...  Eric, following Dr. Ian Smith's...  He's wearing an anchor.  ...book, has lost seven pounds.  Yeah, it looks like...  And Roland has lost eight doing it the other way.  Saying, fuck Dr. Ian Smith.  Yeah.  But let's also...  I do hope he did his book.  Tearing the pages out.  The $1,100 bet is based on percentages, though.  That is true.  So right now, Eric is...  Eric would be ahead. 
[01:21:00]  You should take a diet shit on Dr. Ian Smith's book.  Oh, let me drink this.  I'll have a good one.  I'll have another klaxi doughmeal.  Does that get you going?  I'm tearing...  I actually go upstairs.  Tearing the ass out of me.  And I hear people walking go...  Does it bother you when they do that?  I giggle because I hear he's...  I gather the big wings walking like...  This has also been Roland's up new thing, too.  He won't shit downstairs because he knows somebody's going to report that it's him here. 
[01:21:30]  So he goes upstairs and doesn't care who from management walks into that bathroom because  nobody's going to report him.  No one's going to suspect him.  And he could just let that stench fly.  Who had buffalo wings?  You should do an ass blast all over the wall up there.  Oh, God.  Spray some mud.  Spraying mud.  Show them who the real boss is.  It's some JFK brain.  All right.  So far, you know, going okay. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Riveting.  It is.  It is kind of...  Everyone loves the drama.  I think it's kind of riveting because of the whole Dr. Ian Smith angle.  If this was just a weight loss thing, granted, who gives a fuck?  Dr. Ian Smith's a fuck.  There are a lot of guys out there saying they're trying to lose weight alongside you guys.  It's tough.  But the Dr. Ian Smith might be just a bullshitter or something.  I don't know.  I can't believe you.  I like the guy.  Yeah, me too.  But we said...  I told him, I go, man, this popcorn rules.  It really was good.  And he goes, oh, no problem. 
[01:22:30]  I'll send a whole bunch for you guys.  That was a week ago.  Yeah.  That day, I texted him.  Hey, here's the address.  You can send the big box to me.  I'll pass that to Eric, whoever.  Right.  To our stuff.  He went, okay.  Right.  Don't make us go back to Popcorn Buddha, man.  I know.  Love those people, but...  That's not weight loss popcorn.  No.  No.  No.  No.  It's fucking good, though.  No, no, no, no.  Damn good shit.  Peanut butter bars and Whole Foods.  Yeah.  That's the thing, because I don't have his whatever shred bars. 
[01:23:00]  Shred.  Shred.  Shred.  I might have lost two pounds.  I'm made out of tires.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not into his shred.  Shred.  Nothing to it.  It's shred food.  Very...  Are you disappointed in him?  Yeah, because he was all like, I'm going to help you.  I was like, look, I'm giving up saying no to chefs.  It kills me every day.  So if you're going to help me, I'm in.  And then he just leaves me alone like a fucking animal.  Yeah, it's hard.  Roland needs to be rescued.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Roland's a rescue. 
[01:23:30]  I'll bite his ass.  Imagine bringing Roland home as a rescue.  Oh, God.  It's very upsetting.  All right.  You're doing well, though.  Yeah.  But you think he's a piece of shit?  Of course.  Wow.  And he means it because, you know...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the guest booker.  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree.  And you know, I don't know if you saw his tweets, but Ian Smith was tweeting over the  weekend that E-Rock and Roland were not contacting him.  I know, and they were.  It took me everything not to trash him on Twitter.  Wait a minute.  Wow. 
[01:24:00]  Let me ask you.  Has either one of you guys contacted him and gotten a response?  I finally got one after the weekend of his constantly posting that we're not responding  to him.  Oh.  And I said, look, I wrote to you.  I said, I'm following you.  It's going good so far.  I'm following you.  Yeah.  And then I got a text from him saying that, hang on, apparently he wasn't getting the right  information or something.  Where is it here?  I think Bob Kelly's book and Joe Cross. 
[01:24:30]  This is something.  Why is Joe Cross a little levity?  Good one, yeah.  Where is it?  Very little.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Will Cole Cole?  Yep-er.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Where is he?  I don't think he doesn't even have a voicemail picking up. 
[01:25:00]  Welcome to our world.  That's exactly what.  No.  Do me a favor.  Leave a voice message.  I'll get back to you.  Take care.  There's no number there, right?  The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages.  Oh, wow.  Welcome to the whole world.  Oh, no.  I have a feeling this deal has been made with a few different radio shows. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, no, man.  I say Eric and I sit at the 500 and say fuck.  Oh, wow.  I think that a few different radio shows are fucking.  Can't even get a hold of them.  Wow.  He knows how to get his free plugs, though, doesn't he?  Wow.  Use the 500 to have a pizza party in the office.  I can do good with 500.  Wow.  I can do better because there's a place he wants to bring tons of food over.  Oh.  I can't even tell him that we're trying to get a hold of him.  He says, wow, all right. 
[01:26:00]  Something tells me he's got a, like, a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone.  He probably doesn't have the naughty boy phone.  Right, right.  That's not the phone he uses on a daily basis.  Wow.  Listen to what some of these tweets say.  On the 20th, somebody tweeted to Roland and E-Rock, so I take it you haven't gotten  the blender or the snacks yet.  And Ian Smith tweeted, I can't even get them to answer me.  Oh, man.  Clear your voicemail, Chachi.  Wow. 
[01:26:30]  Something's, uh, a mess.  Do you think he's been following up?  No.  There's probably, like, fat women trying to call him crying.  Like, I'm hungry.  I'm hungry.  What do I do?  And then Wendy Williams goes, what do I do?  Oh, all right.  He's basically, he's calling Roland a liar on Twitter.  Oh, shit.  That's not good.  I mean, that's what he's doing.  That's not good.  No.  No, but...  See, that's one of the things I wrote.  Why don't you read it?  Yeah, E-Rock, don't be so shy.  You're a shy sea lion. 
[01:27:00]  So, Dr. Ian Smith tweeted, E-Rock, you say I don't follow up.  I've hit you several times, but no response.  What's up?  Whoa.  And Eric writes, yo, so far it's going good.  Tried some of the recipes in the book.  Oh.  And then what happened?  You fold with them.  Then I got...  Your phone's heavy, by the way.  Well...  Jesus.  Huh?  It's on her.  Oh, it's the extra battery on the back?  Yeah.  It's the extra battery on it.  It just always goes that way.  It does.  Okay. 
[01:27:30]  There's your update.  Whew.  What, Sam?  I just think it's crazy that Ian Smith is basically saying, no, Roland and E-Rock are liars.  Uh-huh.  They're the ones who are not fulfilling their part of the bargain.  Right.  Right, Roland?  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  But you don't mind, right?  Eh, why not?  What?  Can't leave you guys hanging.  I can't say steak for this jag-ass.  You took this stuff very seriously, right, Roland?  When you're in?  You're in.  I was invited to a nice French dinner last night with Coco Vaughn again, but now I have 
[01:28:00]  to say no.  Damn.  Very upsetting.  Who's Coco Vaughn?  Exactly.  I think chicken in a red wine sauce.  I thought it was a person.  So did I.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  It was a delicious meal.  Mm-hmm.  You're better off not, though, man.  Even though I know it's really tempting and it's tasty, it's like, you know.  Yeah, just get your stuff back together.  Yeah.  Then you can figure out cheat days and stuff like that.  Domino's commercials.  Yeah.  Domino's.  Hey, do we have the clips from that 600-pound? 
[01:28:30]  Not yet.  Oh, we don't?  Mm-mm.  They didn't have it?  No, I'm pulling it off.  I recorded it last night.  I'm pulling it off my DVR, so.  So we'll play it tomorrow.  Yeah.  I watched another episode last night.  Yeah.  Another fat woman that, she wasn't as despicable as the other woman, but her husband was more  despicable than the other husband.  The husband was a chubby chaser.  He hooked up with her.  That's a real thing, chubby chaser.  Oh, God, yeah.  At a fat, like, I don't even know what it was, like a singles thing. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  Where these fat women, they showed them in, like, jacuzzis in a pool, and they're, like,  morbidly obese.  Not just fat, like, fucking fat.  And he married her because she was fat.  And she goes.  What was the event called?  Was it, like, a.  I don't even fuck.  A barn off.  It was, uh, they just, they like fat fucking women.  And, uh, and he wasn't fat.  He just likes big, fat women. 
[01:29:30]  And he is all pissed off that she's getting the, that she got the operation, and she's  losing weight.  And he's like, oh, what are you eating there?  What, ugh, ugh.  And he just constantly pounds on her about losing weight.  He wants her to be fat.  And she realizes that if she does attain her goal, she loses him because he doesn't want  to, to him, that's just as bad as having a skinny chick get all fat on you.  Yeah.  So what is she going to do?  She's, you know, got to commit herself to losing weight.  And she's got a kid also. 
[01:30:00]  So, yeah, she's doing it for the kid and herself.  I get the husband's point of view, though.  She's got to dump that husband, though.  It's almost like if you marry a chick and she's gross.  It's like he married her, like, look, I met you at a fucking fatso meeting.  A fatso meeting?  You know what I mean?  Like, you knew I liked you like this.  And it's fair.  He likes fatties, yeah.  He should just, they should just get divorced.  And he should just let her.  Right, right.  Yeah, they should get divorced.  He should get another fatty.  Yeah, well, realize that mommy left and that's why he's upset.  Right, right.  There's definitely something there.  Why don't we talk to a chubby chase?  Oh. 
[01:30:30]  We got Jason from Ohio.  Jason.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, yeah, I don't dig on no skinny girls at all.  Wow.  No, huh?  No.  What do you like?  I have no business with no skinny girl.  You like big fucking fat chicks?  Not sloppy fat.  Pleasantly plump, I would say.  Okay.  Yeah.  I like 200, 225.  It's good for me.  That's fat.  Yeah.  How tall, though?  Nine feet?  Wait.  A girl that's 225, that's fat. 
[01:31:00]  Big girl.  Nah.  A guy can carry 225 way better than most women, I do believe.  Yeah, I just don't like all skinny girls.  What is it you like about the big girls, sir?  I don't know.  I just say, ever since I was a kid, I always went for the fat girl in school, too.  Are you afraid of being abandoned?  No, not at all.  Oh, okay.  Just a preference.  I've been with my wife for 16 years.  Where the hell is she going to go?  Is she fat?  Oh, yeah.  She's 265. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  And that just turned you on, huh?  And you love that?  I love it to death, buddy.  God damn, let me tell you something.  And how much do you weigh?  I weigh about 185.  Oh, she's got 80 pounds on you.  Oh, yeah.  I just would not be able to deal with that.  Yeah, what is it that...  I don't understand the attraction, that's all.  I don't understand the attraction either, Jimmy, but I just...  You just love it.  Those little skinny girls do nothing for me. 
[01:32:00]  And not even to be a dick, but there's like...  If somebody's really heavy, sometimes they smell a little weird in certain places behind...  My wife is extremely clean.  Okay.  She takes two showers a day, once in the morning and once at night.  Okay.  She's an excellent house.  She cooks.  She cleans.  Of course she cooks.  She works a full-time job.  Of course she cooks.  Wow.  All right.  Hey, that's...  I don't know what to say.  Yeah, if that's your thing, I'm not going to sit here and say...  I don't understand it, but...  Yeah, maybe there is...  Hey, look, maybe there's not a lot...  It's not a lot of time to say anything psychological. 
[01:32:30]  Like...  It's just as...  You just like what you like.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  There you are.  Yeah.  She's physically active.  She...  Like I said, she...  She...  Let's not...  Let's slow down.  Physically active.  Make it like she's an Olympic athlete over here.  Exactly.  Just because she still can walk.  Yeah, she's the best.  Doesn't mean she's physically active.  She's an airline pilot.  Right, right.  She helps birthing mothers in cabs.  Blue whales are active, too, sir.  They're very active.  All right, guys.  I got to go.  All right.  All right. 
[01:33:00]  Thank you, I said...  God damn it.  That's just mean.  We were pretty polite there, though.  We were pretty nice and gentle.  That is true.  There wasn't really anything you could get him on.  He just likes it, and that's it.  The captain and Tennille are getting a divorce.  Why bother?  38 years.  Why bother at that point?  Oh, look.  They put love won't keep them together.  It did, though.  And love.  Love will keep us together.  39 years is pretty damn good.  Yeah.  It kept them together.  She finally got sick of that dumb captain hat.  Yeah.  Right. 
[01:33:30]  Wears everywhere.  Yeah.  How old are they?  They got to be pushing 80, you know?  Oh, yeah.  They got to be up there.  Not 80.  Why?  They were...  Really?  They were...  Damn.  They were around in the fucking early 70s.  Mid-70s?  Down there?  How old are they?  Captain and Tennille.  Tony Tennille, right?  Their house was used for porn shoots, I heard.  Yeah.  Dun-dun.  Dun-dun.  Dun-dun.  Dun-dun.  Love.  Love will keep us together. 
[01:34:00]  Dun-dun.  Think of me, babe, whenever.  Some sweet talk.  The captain was in what band?  Captain and Tennille.  No.  I think he was in a band before he was in Captain and Tennille.  Before they teamed up?  Yeah, wasn't he?  You're on your own on this one.  I don't know.  I think.  He was in the Beach Boys, I think, right?  No.  Yes, he was a keyboardist for the Beach Boys.  Yeah, he was a keyboardist for the Beach Boys.  When the Beach Boys were the Beach Boys?  Well, yeah.  Like when they were really... 
[01:34:30]  Back in like the 60s, I guess.  Captain is 71.  Is that what I'm getting?  I swear to God, I never knew that.  Yeah, yeah.  He was a...  Wow.  He was a Beach Boy.  What albums was he on, though?  Hence, Captain, I guess, you know?  It's a nautical.  What albums?  What albums was he on for the Beach Boys?  Yeah, what...  Was he on any of the albums, the good ones?  Or was it before the Beach Boys hit?  I don't know.  Yeah, you'd think he would have been a little more well-known.  No, he was in the Beach Boys in 1972. 
[01:35:00]  72?  Oh, that's after.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  So he wasn't really in the Beach Boys.  He was on the album Carl and the Passion.  So tough.  Wow.  What?  So that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, he wasn't in the Beach Boys.  Hot and the Carl's.  He wasn't in the Beach Boys, Beach Boys.  No.  No, no, no.  I guess not.  He was...  He was...  That's like saying John Stamos was in the Beach Boys.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right.  This is a good song, though, for Pete's sake. 
[01:35:30]  I remember hearing this one.  Driving to, like, Grandma's house in the back seat.  Because Joe would always call shotgun, and he was the older brother, so he would get to  sit in the front seat.  Me and Dawn had to sit in the back seat.  And then this would come on.  I'm actually sad that this is ending in a divorce.  Yeah.  I was rooting for a murder-suicide.  Oh, okay.  You scared me for a second.  Oh, shit.  Let's talk to Rob in Boston. 
[01:36:00]  Hey there, Rob.  What's up, Ria?  Hey, guys.  You guys are talking about chubby chases.  Back in the day, I used to bartend this party north of Boston called Heavy Hotties.  And it was all chicks over 250, and they'd just invite a shitload of single guys.  What was it called?  Heavy Hotties.  Heavy Hotties.  Yeah.  So it was kind of a little bit comical, a little bit disgusting, but always a fun night  to work.  I can imagine.  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  And the guys were all like a buck ten.  It was kind of comical.  I remember one time at Geneseo, I was at the rat bar, whatever they were fucking called.  The Rathskeller?  Rathskeller.  I was 18 with my new friends, because I'm from Long Island, and we all went and drank  and got fucking shit-faced to the point where I'm not, I swear, blinded.  Yeah, yeah.  Just fucking wasted.  And I started making out with this girl. 
[01:37:00]  And I started looking around and seeing people looking like, what the fuck is he doing, right?  Uh-oh.  And I swear to you, in my mind, I was making out with a ten.  And as I started to become more aware, I realized I couldn't even get my arms around her.  She was that big.  But my recollection is, I don't remember her being that big when I decided to make out with her.  This is a true story.  Wow, you were fucked up.  I was so fucking gone, and they're all laughing and stuff at me. 
[01:37:30]  I'm like, what, man?  This girl's hot, you know?  And then I started, like, because of them, I became more aware and started my senses.  It started coming back to you, and you're like, oh, wait a minute.  And I'll never forget that I then realized, because I had my arms around, and I'm like,  wait a minute, my arms are not even close to being together in the back.  But the big question, you fucker, hell nah, you fucker, hell nah.  I remember it was a good time, though. 
[01:38:00]  And the boys had to ruin my fun by pointing and laughing at me.  You're kissing as you're kissing fucking Wilbur the pig in a corner.  How are you that wasted?  You don't even know.  Oh, it happens.  I don't know.  People have done worse.  I don't know.  Over the years, I feel like I've been able to keep the senses.  Keep control.  Yeah, but not that time.  Absolutely not that fucking time.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, what are you going to do?  In college, what are you going to do, right?  What are you going to do?  Exactly.  Boy, they are running with this Bieber story.  Who gives a shit?  Like, this kind of stuff that's...  But perhaps the most interesting part of it is, how did the Miami cops behave, and did  they facilitate and aid him in doing whatever he was doing, which raises the possibility  of wrongdoing by the police, in addition to...  Would that mitigate the charges?  Probably not, although...  You know, in a situation like this, the most important thing is, at least no one seems 
[01:39:00]  to have gotten hurt.  That's the most important thing we're talking about with all these circumstances.  If no one got hurt, if, you know, it was a drunk driving matter, you know, it's serious.  It's a felony.  It's potentially a felony, but it means he loses his license, it means he gets probation.  If he has one, I guess I was assuming he did.  I don't know for sure.  You know, interesting question.  That would have come up before, though, wouldn't it?  All right, Fatty.  Is he?  I don't know if he rolls red.  Look at any car.  Fuck, you think she is.  She's a giant. 
[01:39:30]  I think she's Andre the Giant in, like, drag.  She has a big wig.  Big red dress.  Huge red dress.  There's a story on Gawker about an Animal Planet show that's fake and super abusive to  animals.  Yeah.  Someone tweeted that to me, like, that's why reality TV just sucks.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  Do you know that show, Call the Wild Man?  Um...  I never heard of that one.  No.  No, reality shows just fucking...  I used to love reality shows.  I used to love them. 
[01:40:00]  They've gotten way out of hand where they're so fake.  Well, they're either fake or they have to set up all the storylines because they decide  to pick the most boring people in the world to give a reality show to.  And the turnaround...  A la the Kardashians come to mind and many others.  The turnaround time has to be so fast with these things now.  They don't have time to get enough decent footage from real events to make an interesting  show.  It's too bad because that shit was working.  Yeah.  But now every day has to have...  Is an activity and they make it look like they just came up with like, hey, I think I 
[01:40:30]  want to jump out of a plane today.  Yeah.  There was a producer that said, today, this is what we're going to do, you dummies, because  you can't think for yourself.  And then the big tease, like something went wrong.  Right.  Yeah.  A piece of plywood falls around.  Ah!  Look out!  Plywood fell!  Ah!  Plywood falling!  That's it.  Dennis in Boston has something.  A lot of Boston calls today.  Boston. 
[01:41:00]  Boki Bar.  Hey, boys.  Hi, Dennis.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, I was down in Cancun when I was 21.  I'm 36 now.  Spring break.  I was loaded in the bar.  My buddy just told me to park it because I was so drunk.  They're cool.  This girl comes over and starts making out with me.  I say to my buddy, dude, I know I'm shitted.  How is she?  He says, just look at her tits.  I say, fair enough.  The girl starts jerking me off in the bar, everything.  I black out for a while. 
[01:41:30]  He blacks out with a girl jacking them off.  Clothes in.  And the girl wants me to go home with her.  Well, back to our hotel.  I'm sobering up, and I'm realizing how fat she was.  And I just can't find my friends.  We leave the bar together.  I hear one of my buddies yell out, hey, Dennis, he's sitting on a scooter.  Not a scooter, a jet ski on the front lawn of the bar.  I just say, thank Christ, and I just leave the girl.  Oh, you're laughing.  And I wake up.  I have a big fucking hickey on my neck, spending the rest of my time at spring break 
[01:42:00]  with a fucking hickey and canker.  Oh, man.  If you were tagged.  That happened to me one time.  I was so fucking suited, and I'm with this chick, and I'm fucking her a whole lot.  And then in the morning, I'm like, oh, fucking Scarlet Johannesburg.  Yeah, Chippa.  All right, boys.  Punch note.  Very good, brother.  Thank you, Dennis.  He was like, Chippa, you knocked my fucking uterus out.  Oh, wow.  That's a compliment.  I was like, whatevs?  Whatevs. 
[01:42:30]  Let's say hi to, you asked about this wild man, Jimmy.  We got it.  Troy in Jersey is going to help you out.  Cool.  Troy.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hello.  Hey.  You know, you guys got to check out Turtle Man.  Wow, man.  He's just the greatest hick ever.  He's having turtles in the lakes.  And he gets paid in apple pies.  Oh, yuck.  Oh, that's wacky.  Fake.  Yeah.  You got to check out a video.  He's just great.  This guy just screams in the air when he catches turtles.  Yeah.  Well, aren't they saying that he drugged the animals or was using something like that? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I don't even care.  The guy's growing.  I don't even hear nothing about him.  I just need to go.  Oh, it's all fake.  He rubbed himself in corn and finds raccoons.  Oh, it's fake.  No, the fakest show is Welcome to Myrtle Manor on TLC.  It's about a fake trailer park.  It's all about just fake trailer park people.  They're all fake.  It's fake, fake.  It's a new big thing, man.  It's how you make fun of you.  Shit.  I see clips.  People put clips up.  They're like, watch this.  It's hilarious.  Right.  It's fucking not.  It's not hilarious. 
[01:43:30]  And it's fake.  It's not hilarious.  No.  I'm pitching a show called Jaguar World.  Oh.  It's about a man who lives in a house and jaguars keep popping up.  Like, he opens the cabinet.  And they just pop up.  To get out some cornmeal and there's a jaguar in there.  That sounds dangerous.  Why would you be getting some cornmeal out?  Cornmeal.  I don't know.  Why would you do that?  It's a true story.  Cornmeal.  He opens up his walk and there's a jaguar waiting.  Oh, wow.  That's dangerous, too.  He's mauled once every episode.  That would rule. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Tune in.  Yeah.  People were wondering why you were so quiet during the Chubby Chaser segment.  What?  Dreamweaver was a big girl, wasn't she?  Oh, yeah.  But I didn't know at the time.  That was CB radio shit.  Oh, the big reveal.  That's right.  Yeah, when you used to make your dates off of the CB radio, it wasn't like fucking Twitter  or, you know, Facebook or anywhere where you see a picture.  So I didn't know she was going to be huge. 
[01:44:30]  It was, you know, Breaker Breaker, it's the Wrangler.  Dreamweaver, you're out there.  You got your ears on.  And then, you know, hey, this is the Dreamweaver.  And then I made a date with her and, you know, she turned out to be a little overweight.  What am I going to say?  I've told this story before.  I know.  The poor horse.  You were scared for the extra horse you brought along for Dreamweaver.  I was going to be all man.  You felt so bad for the extra horse.  I was like, yeah, Dreamweaver made a whole date on the CB.  Like, you want to go horseback riding? 
[01:45:00]  She's like, oh, yeah, that sounds great.  What did you saddle up to an extra horse?  I have my horse.  I, you know, tie the reins around the horn of my saddle.  And I load it up with all kinds of stuff because I expected that we were going to spend a lot of time up in the hills together.  Some of that quality time.  Some of that quality time.  Just me, her, up in the hills on horseback.  I was going to hunt.  I was going to, like, shoot a rabbit and cook it up for us.  Seriously?  Yeah.  I had everything.  And what did you think she looked like in your mind? 
[01:45:30]  Do you remember?  She was weaving my dreams, Opie.  But do you remember, like, what you thought she would look like?  Yeah.  I did have an image of just a slender.  Well, obviously all that, but like brown hair, big boobies.  What are we talking?  Do you remember?  Dark hair, big, beautiful eyes, cute smile, and, you know, like, built very nicely, put together very nicely. 
[01:46:00]  Right.  Maybe in some kind of Western attire, because that was kind of sexy at the time, I thought.  And what did you see that day?  Holy mother of pearl.  I rode up with the horse tied up to my saddle and rode up, and I saw her standing at the meeting place where the two, the Capistrano River kind of split.  That was your meeting place?  That was our meeting place.  And I was like, and there wasn't a chance that it could have been someone else.  Right.  It's the divide of a river. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  There's no one else there.  But we should put a plaque in that area now.  It should be.  This is where I met Dreamweaver.  The divide of the Capistrano River in San Juan Capistrano.  We've got fans all over the place.  I know.  Someone should just do that for you.  Here is the place.  They're close enough.  A historical marker.  Yeah, get a historical marker.  Yeah, yeah.  Where Anthony's dreams were shattered.  And it was weird because at first, you know, when someone's far away like that, I couldn't tell. 
[01:47:00]  I could just tell there was a person there.  Right.  So as I'm riding up, I was just thrilled that I wasn't stood up.  But were you starting to get like butterflies?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was getting all nervous and everything.  I'm like, oh, she's here.  This is so cool.  And again, through my head, I'm just, I'm running the whole thing through my head like, all right, we're going to ride up the river.  And then up into the hills and, you know, we'll put down the sleeping bags.  I'll make a fire.  You knew the exact spot you were going to stop for the night? 
[01:47:30]  Dude, I knew exactly.  It was by a big lake.  Right.  Up in the middle of the hills.  And I was going to pull out the 22 that I had, a little lever action 22.  And I was going to fucking bag a rabbit and skin it and cook it over a fire.  And we were going to sit there.  I brought some booze with me, you know, sneak a little booze.  It was going to be the greatest fucking night of my life up till then.  Wait, what tipped you off when the horse started to whinny and buck at the prospect of that monster sitting on it? 
[01:48:00]  It literally went, oh, it was fucking, it was going to be great.  And then the closer I got, I was like, oh, maybe, maybe she's cold and bundled up.  And wearing a fat person on her.  Maybe she's cold.  Oh, you were hoping there were some layers.  And then as I got closer, it was, she literally, here's what she looked like. 
[01:48:30]  She looked like Mama Cass Elliot.  No.  Yes.  I'm not talking a little chubby or chunky.  She was fucking fat.  Huge.  Huge fat.  She had the Mama Cass face.  The whole deal.  Were you disappointed?  Oh, was I?  Because you got to, you got to remember this.  This is like early teens.  And you are like every chance you get to be with a girl in any way, shape or form, a date, a fucking something like that is golden. 
[01:49:00]  And it doesn't happen a lot at that age.  It's so rare.  It's very difficult to spin that.  To get something done.  And then to have this thing built up in my head that, you know, this is going to be Clint Eastwood.  I was fucking Clint Eastwood.  This is going to be great.  Your brother once in.  Oh.  Brother Joe.  I don't remember.  I don't remember the timeline exactly whether this was before or after Buzz. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, we know the Buzz story.  Of course.  I know, but was it before or after?  I believe this was pre-Buzz.  It was pre-Buzz.  Okay, because we also had a ton, I mean a ton, of little babe teenage girls hanging out around the stables all the time.  Yeah, but they were.  Like Kendall.  Right, right.  But they weren't good to go, a lot of them.  You know, we could have a little fun with them.  But, you know.  I don't know.  It was always Rami, too, I remember. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, yeah, she was a goer.  Boy, back then, those girls didn't give a shit.  Girls were just fucking, it was the sexual revolution, I think they were calling it.  I do remember the day that you met her, though, and it was an awful day for you.  It was so disappointing.  And I wound up, so I couldn't just say, hey, you know, take a hike.  So I'm like, all right, let's take a ride.  It was the shortest horseback ride I ever took.  We went up in the hills, and then I was like, all right, you want to go back? 
[01:50:30]  I got begged by dad for weed with a Mexican chick.  Remember, I was holding on to weed for that Mexican chick.  Yeah, yeah, Joe had weed in his sock, and my father found it.  What's in your sock?  My father was always great on disciplining us for doing bad things, and then he would just do the worst things ever.  Yeah, so I went three kids in the bed of a truck over the Ortegas while trashed.  Yeah, yeah, as he was hammered, but, you know, a little weed in your sock. 
[01:51:00]  Or if I steal a few quarters to buy some ice cream sandwiches, it was the worst thing ever.  Oh, well, what are you going to do?  What do you got going on Friday night, anything?  No, what do you got?  I got the Village Idiot Pub.  Come on down and sing with me.  Nice.  Where is that?  From like 7 to 9 in Patchogue.  It's on Main Street, Patchogue.  Main Street, Patchogue, Village Idiot Pub.  All right.  Cool, man.  All right, cool.  Yeah, definitely.  We'll do a few songs.  Bye, Joe.  Take a tizzy, Joe.  All right, brother Joe.  Bye, Matt. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, that was a short fucking horseback.  That was a short fucking ride.  We went up and then rode back down.  I was so disappointed.  And then...  You ever see her again?  Well, let me...  I had to listen to this for weeks.  Wrangler, Wrangler, this is Dreamweaver.  You out there?  You out there?  And then I'm like, I can't even now get on the CB and try to find some other chicks. 
[01:52:00]  Because if she knows I'm on the CB...  Oh, she was hoping that.  Yeah.  You thought it was a good time.  Yep.  Wait a minute.  She must have known.  Did you fuck her or no?  No!  Did you kiss her?  Nothing.  How long did you hang out with her?  As short a time as I had to without making her kind of feel bad or anything.  More than six hours?  No, no.  It was probably two hours.  Okay, that's nice.  It was a ride up in the hills, a ride back, and then like, all right, I gotta go. 
[01:52:30]  You know, take it easy.  And then I saw her...  Well, the only other time I saw her was at another ranch that we had ridden to, and she  was sitting...  A pig farm?  Yeah, the pig farm.  Must be one chalming, motherfucking pig.  It was at another ranch, and it was at night, and we rode up, and she was sitting around  a fire with other people, and they were like singing songs.  And I rode past and kind of looked over and was like, oh, that's her, and I just didn't  look.  I didn't look. 
[01:53:00]  My horse looked over and said, hey, it's not the fat shoulder!  No, it didn't.  Ah, right.  Do you think she knows who you are now?  Nah, probably not.  I always wonder that shit.  I do too sometimes.  With some of these weird stories, I'm, you know...  I wonder if they kept tabs on you a little bit.  There are some people in California that know who I am, and stuff like that.  Sure, they're like Martin.  Yeah, they're like Martin Preschool.  There's a girl on Facebook that recently started following me, or liking me, whatever 
[01:53:30]  it is, and she was one of the girls I talked about here that stood me up on a date at the  disco that my mom worked at, and she was like, oh, yeah, we'll be right back.  We're going to, you know, get a friend for my friend.  Oh, and you bought it.  And I was like, okay, all right.  But you're willing to believe anything like that.  Exactly.  So I was just standing there outside.  And you would rationalize in your head, like, oh, they must have got stuck in traffic.  First of all, there's a club full of dudes, and they have to leave to find a guy for this 
[01:54:00]  girl.  And then she's like, oh, yeah, yeah, we'll be back.  I'm like, okay.  So I just stood, like, outside, and I'm looking out the door, like, instead of just having  a good time.  And when you're in that position, you'll look out the door, and then you'll go to yourself,  all right, I'm going to only give it 15 more minutes.  Fuck, dang.  And then 15 minutes go by, like, yeah, but if I leave, as you might walk around, I'm going  to give it another 15 minutes. 
[01:54:30]  Two hours went by, and then she actually wrote, she was like, oh, I heard you were talking  about the time at the disco, and she was like, oh, I'm sorry, yeah, we were, like, fucking  just crazy back then.  I wasn't thinking about, so she apologized.  Years later.  Years later, I got the apology.  Years later, that's weird.  Yeah.  It's going to fill a new Rochelle.  Phil.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, how you doing? 
[01:55:00]  Where's the Holderant's shell?  Whoa.  Oh, fucking forget following that.  Go to break.  All right, I think I got a hold of Dr. Ian Smith.  I'm hoping this is him now on the hotline.  Uh, where are the guys?  I don't know.  We better wrangle them up.  For the people just tuning in, um, well, I'll tell Dr. Ian Smith as well. 
[01:55:30]  Sir?  Hey, guys.  Pal?  There he is.  Pal of mine.  Hello, Dr. Ian Smith.  Uh, Roland and E-Rock, not happy so far.  Oh, boy.  And I don't think it's fair to have this discussion without getting your side of it.  Yeah, we got to get them, too.  But, uh, they feel like, uh, they've been abandoned since your visit on our show last week.  Oh, they do?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy, do they.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  Well, the good news is I can pull up my Twitter feed.  Yeah.  All right.  How many times I tweet these guys saying, I'm reaching out to you guys, making sure everything 
[01:56:00]  is good.  I'm here for you.  I don't want to have a repeat of your feeling that I abandoned you like last time.  Right.  Well, I got the Twitter feed.  So, if you want to go documentation route, we can do that.  Yes.  Yes, of course we do.  Because the last time we did documentation route, Dr. Ian Smith trounced the American.  That is true.  That is true.  I told Sam to get the guys, and, uh, he's having a tough time finding them, so maybe  they're...  I just texted Roland.  I don't know what's going on.  Where the hell did they go?  This is bizarre.  While we're waiting for them, I can read you a text message that I got from E-Rock. 
[01:56:30]  Okay.  And just so people at home know, these guys are doing...  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Here's E-Rock now.  I want him to hear this.  We at least got one.  E-Rock, get headphones on fast.  We got Dr. Ian Smith, who's on the set of his TV show out there in L.A.  The doctors, right?  Yes.  When are you going on?  Um, we start taping in about 10 minutes.  Oh, shit.  And you're bothering with us?  I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no, no.  You guys are family.  Family always first.  Oh.  Well, I don't know if we're family.  It's nice.  No, no, you guys are family. 
[01:57:00]  Our colors are a little different.  That's right.  That's a modern American family.  That's true.  Very diverse.  All on the spectrum, fellas.  All on the spectrum.  So just so people know...  All right, wait.  Here's Eric.  Eric, we got Dr. Ian Smith.  Roland is coming.  And Roland's coming.  Go ahead.  Okay, so, you know, I said these guys are going to go on a super shred diet.  Right.  And, you know, four weeks, 20 pounds.  It's an aggressive program to lose weight, right?  Right.  But it's regular food.  I mean, it's not like you can only drink lemonade or only eat cabbage soup.  So last time I was on, E-Rock said that he felt as though I was so good to people when I'm doing it on TV, 
[01:57:30]  but they felt like I banned them last time.  Right.  So I wanted to make a concerted effort this time not for them to feel that way,  because I am a physician, and I feel if he was serious about that, I really felt bad about it.  So I've been sending lots of tweets to these guys.  And this is the text message I got on Monday, by the way.  Hello.  This is from E-Rock to me.  Hello.  I keep seeing on Twitter that you think we haven't responded to you. 
[01:58:00]  I have.  Things are going good, and we made some of your recipes, which were pretty good.  E-Rock.  My response to him was, oh, okay, I wasn't hearing anything.  Glad it's going well.  I felt bad that you felt like I abandoned you before, so I just didn't want you to think that this time.  Glad it's going well.  Keep in touch.  I'm here for you.  And his answer was, will do.  So I'm not sure.  So now Roland just walked in.  What you missed is Ian is saying that he played E-Rock.  E-Rock, he's reading his Twitter feed and saying he did, in fact, reach out. 
[01:58:30]  So Sam's going to pull it up now, and then.  Right.  E-Rock, comment?  Yeah.  It was, like we said, it was based on all weekend.  I was seeing stuff saying, people writing to Ian and Ian writing, saying that he hadn't heard from us.  And when Ian had written, I wrote back to him.  And then he kept posting, I haven't heard from you guys.  So I sent him a thing on Twitter, and then on a text, I said, I'm writing to you.  I've been responding to you.  I'm using your book.  It's going well, and I tried some of your recipes. 
[01:59:00]  Okay.  Okay.  And so all I'm trying to say is that, first of all, I'm in it for E-Rock and Roland, because they want to take it out.  Hold on.  I guess this would be a good time to tell you that you're not in it for Roland anymore.  Oh, shit.  Oh, geez.  He might be.  Jumping ship.  He might have jumped ship.  Roland, you want to explain?  Yes.  I didn't have the snacks or anything, so I used a different diet book to modify it, because I need my snacks. 
[01:59:30]  The guys were a little disappointed that the blenders and snacks didn't know.  I didn't need snacks.  Wait, hold on.  Hold on, guys.  Hold on.  Now, honestly.  We're kind of bummed you didn't send the popcorn.  Hold on for a second, guys.  The back of the book has over 200 snacks you can choose from, 150 calories and 100 calories.  And you're going to say to me on national radio that the reason you decided not to do Super Shred was because you didn't have my Shred Pop popcorn?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  And the Shred bars, you know.  So all the people in the country right now who are on Super Shred, losing a lot of weight, who don't have my popcorn, they don't have their experience. 
[02:00:00]  This is all about the popcorn, I guess.  It makes a good point.  Your popcorn must be that good.  Well, I am fat and lazy, so I need extra help.  Oh, Roland.  Oh, Roland.  Wow.  But I'm doing different juices, though, too.  I'm doing more greens than the fruits, so I want to gain the weight.  But that's on the Super Shred diet.  You can do smoothies and juices all day long.  I mean, I'm confused. 
[02:00:30]  You're actually talking about doing Super Shred, yet you're saying you're doing another diet.  Well, a combo.  A combination.  Oh, Roland.  You were full of piss and vinegar before.  You were fucking spitting fire, and now you're kind of making excuses.  He might have said he ripped up your bookie, man.  Oh, my God.  He might have said that.  The guys were a little hurt, Ian.  I think what happens is, as you know, they're both very poorly guys who are very addicted  to food, and it's like a big withdrawal, and I think that they feel a little bit needy.  They need a little more hand-holding. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, guys, guess what?  What?  You have my direct cell phone, because E-Rock and Roland, you both texted me.  You can text me.  The voicemail box is full.  No, text me.  Text me.  Text me.  No one leaves voicemail box and voice messages.  Come on, guys.  Everyone texts these days.  That's right.  Oh, man.  We do need the blender, too, to make our delicious smoothies.  Okay.  I told you the blender comes out in two weeks.  I told you that when I was in the studio.  Oh, it's not even out yet.  I didn't hear that.  We've got that point.  Oh, boy, did we give you a beating on your blood. 
[02:01:30]  I only have one myself, which is a prototype.  It comes out in two weeks.  Oh, and it turns out they're not even made yet.  No, it takes two weeks.  I even promoted a neutral bullet today.  I'm going to see tours to you.  My bad.  Oh, wow.  Roland's folding like a cheap shirt.  Guys, I'll tell you this.  Yes.  I will make sure, since these guys need hand-holding, that I have someone hand-deliver popcorn, shred-pop popcorn, to you guys today.  Wow.  Today.  Okay. 
[02:02:00]  Hey, could you throw a few extras in there for the people that might not have to lose guys with cake?  Dr. Ian's shredding these two.  We have four flavors, the kettles, the barbecue, the sea salt, white cheddar.  I'm going to put a case of everything to you guys.  Nice.  If they want to check it out, go to shredlife.com, and you can check it out.  But you guys will have your popcorn today, so there's no excuse.  And you'd be proud of me, Dr. Ian Smith.  I lost five pounds since Friday.  Well, you were sick.  Well, I had the flu.  I had, like, a stomach bug.  You had a sick diet.  And I had a lot of water shooting from my ass. 
[02:02:30]  But my question to you is, I really did lose five pounds because I had a stomach thing.  How do you keep that five pounds off?  Super shred.  No, but, I mean, is that mostly water weight that I lost?  It's mostly water weight, but if you go back, so if you go back to eating and stick, like, to lean meat, you know, like chicken and turkey,  and stay away from heavy red meat, and stay away from some of the pastas for a few days, you're going to keep the weight off.  Nice.  Because that scale looked good.  Yeah.  It looked good, right? 
[02:03:00]  Oh, man, it looked good.  Man, Dr. Ian Smith can just turn the situation around.  I'm in town on Tuesday.  In a second.  I'm in town on Tuesday.  You're going to come in and say hi?  I'm coming on Tuesday.  Okay.  I'm going to see you guys.  We're booked.  I kid, I kid, I kid.  I kid, I kid.  But I guess Roland lost eight pounds since you were here.  And E-Rock started off really good, and he's already plateaued in seven.  He lost.  How much?  E-Rock lost seven pounds in two days, and, you know, that's where he's at right now. 
[02:03:30]  What's the complaint about?  They're doing great.  Oh, yeah.  That's good, right?  That's good.  What's wrong with you guys?  Well, they need the popcorn.  Yeah.  And the bars.  And the bars.  Oh, now you want the bars.  Because I'm needy and fat.  Oh, God.  They like to snack.  Remember the Roland we saw before?  Remember that guy?  That's why I wanted to do this.  That guy.  What happened to that guy, Roland?  I knew it.  Rip his head off.  I almost remember hearing, piece of shit.  Right.  No, that was Sam. 
[02:04:00]  No, was it?  No, Sam said, do you think he's a piece of shit?  And I was...  It reminds me of what you had said before.  And I was very, very hungry.  No, but you said before, he's a piece of shit.  No, you said.  And then I asked you if that's what you said, and you said yes.  This is great.  I was very, very hungry.  The whole thing's falling apart.  It really is.  Ian, go ahead.  After all these years I've been with you guys, you call me fecal matter?  Oh, my God.  Right?  I hear you.  I'm with trolls from pizza and all my snacks.  He's jonesing. 
[02:04:30]  After all these years of Roland knowing Ian, Roland just decided he's a piece of shit because  he didn't have popcorn.  His popcorn.  And the blender that isn't built yet.  He put him on the diet for free.  He's giving him all this advice.  And then Roland's like, no popcorn, you piece of shit.  We all might have forgot that the blenders weren't built yet.  You know how fat people get.  We get crazy.  Like cray cray.  All right.  Well, listen.  Listen, guys.  I've got to run through this shoot.  I just want to say you guys are doing great on Super Shred.  There are a lot of people at home who are following you guys, by the way, who took up the challenge. 
[02:05:00]  You can look at the Twitter feed.  They've been tweeting you guys, tweeting the show.  You know, others can join us.  And Super Shred is meant to lose weight quickly.  I'll be in on Tuesday to check you guys out.  And on my Twitter, in case you guys forgot, my Twitter is Dr. Ian Smith.  I-A-N Smith.  Tweet me any day.  I answer my Twitter feed all the time.  All right.  There you go.  I'm with you guys.  I'm going to tweet you and see if you do.  All right.  Get your Shred pop today, fellas.  All right.  Thank you.  Dr. Ian Smith, thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  Although Urock did accuse Ian of possibly having somebody else handling his Twitter.  Handling his Twitter.  But Eric was extremely quiet through the whole thing.  That was before Ian was on the phone.  If you remember, like earlier today, if you're just listening now, listen to the replay and  you'll hear these two.  We're very different.  We're very different.  If I may bring up a Seinfeld episode of when Kramer had to talk to Elaine's psychiatrist.  He took a picture of your guys' book. 
[02:06:00]  I folded.  It just folded.  He fucking Sarah Jessica Parker'd them.  Yes.  He uses Jedi tricks.  He goes, what about this?  I go, ooh, that's...  Jedi mind trick.  All of a sudden, he turns it around to where you're calling yourself an asshole and it's  your fault.  Because he goes, well, he...  From ripping up the book to it's a combination of both diets.  I'll say this.  Damn him for using logic.  Oh, my God.  Nothing better than a good, my bad.  My bad.  My bad.  My bad. 
[02:06:30]  He took the cover for all the ugliness.  Oh, my bad.  He's at the Zekake.  No more.  And Eric?  The snack and blender issue was not my complaint.  That was all it is.  Yeah, but we don't even know what your complaint was because you were very quiet while he was  on the phone.  I said earlier I was actually following the book and everything.  Yeah, that you were complaining that he wasn't communicated.  But you were also frustrated, right.  Yeah, I was complaining because he kept posting we're not responding to him and we were.  Yeah.  That was my complaint.  Everything else was pure Roland that he was ripping the book up.  It was amazing.  And he made a point that we both lost like eight pounds, seven pounds. 
[02:07:00]  That's good for a week.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  That's pretty good.  Come to think of it.  It's just the best.  Insane people.  They just.  They fucking folded.  Yeah, they sure.  And Eric's now like, it was where Rose from.  I'm doing great.  I had fun.  I was fine with that.  I never had an issue.  Ian came in.  I just went through like a fat, crazy withdrawal.  I apologize.  I was just thinking of pizza and I just got crazy.  So I'm screaming shit.  Oh, God.  LOL, Dr. Ian.  LOL. 
[02:07:30]  LOL.  Oh, God.  All right.  Oopsie.  My bad.  There you go.  He called us, though.  I reached out.  I texted him.  Hey, got right back.  Got back.  He's busy.  Your voice is all touching.  He's ready to go and shoot his show.  And he's still had time to fucking call up.  Oopsie.  Right.  But he is right.  No one fucking makes phone calls.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  That's true.  And who knew that was Blender?  And that Blender isn't even built yet.  He did say it on the air.  They're still tinkering.  Still tinkering with the Blender.  I don't remember him saying that. 
[02:08:00]  I remember now.  He did say it on the air.  But I forgot.  I really thought the Blenders were ready to go.  Well.  But after he said it, I'm like, oh, yeah, I think he did say that.  He did say that.  Prototype.  It's a fucking Blender.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Breaking any new ground over there?  And now, I'm going to go back and read the back of the book about that.  His other secret is next.  Good.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want Nick in Ohio to say what we're all thinking.  Go ahead, Nick.  Hey.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah.  So, Dr. Ian Smith went from just mushroom stamping E-Rock. 
[02:08:30]  Now he's double-dicked, and he just fucking stamped both of you guys.  Hey, mushroom stamped him?  You've both got a mushroom stamp.  Mushroom stamped him.  Yeah, you did.  Oh, yeah.  You did.  Fucking mushroom stamped him.  He's dead in my ass.  Oh, is that degrading?  Who came up with that?  Because I love that one.  I did.  No, you didn't.  Was it a caller?  I apologize.  The mushroom stamp makes me laugh.  Boy, doctor.  You both got mushroom stamped.  That's Ian.  When he threw his logic, it made sense.  I was like, hmm, I agree. 
[02:09:00]  He made sense.  Ian, got you.  Roald didn't even acknowledge when he came in here that the popcorn, it's not necessary.  It's a suggestion.  Yeah.  There's snacks.  He didn't read the book.  Right.  Well, you know what, though?  Who reads books, Anthony?  I don't read books.  See, exactly.  You know what, though?  And I'll give this point to Roland here, even though he didn't bring it up.  Thank you.  He was promised the popcorn.  Thank you.  And he didn't get it.  Regardless if there's substitutes or other things, he's promised the popcorn.  That's like an excuse, though.  It's like, okay, well, then I don't have to do the work, because you said popcorn. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Well, you promised a fat person food, and you're giving them food, and you get pretty upset.  I mean, you take away my cheese, you take away my pasta, my sandwiches, my wings, my cakes.  Your pizza.  My Coco Vaughn.  I get very upset.  Your popcorn.  Yes, my popcorn.  And Dr. Ian's popcorn.  And your shred bars.  And the shred bars.  Shred bars.  Tread bars.  Roland felt like he was going to get some tasty treats that were okay to eat, that were predetermined to be okay to eat.  Exactly.  I will go back to the office and read his other suggestion of hundreds of snacks that he just told me. 
[02:10:00]  Ah, there you go.  It's in the back of the book.  I should have read that.  Is it one of the pages you ripped out, that you so bravely spoke about before Dr. Ian got on the phone?  You know.  It's for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  How come you don't eat my snacks?  I've suggested.  How about some Slugners?  Slugners are delicious.  What's a Slugner?  It's when you take a bowl and you mash lima beans into it. 
[02:10:30]  And then you put one chocolate Jimmy.  One sprinkle.  That sounds terrible.  That just sounds awful.  It sure was long.  I realized I had nothing when I interrupted you and you just looked at me and I was like, oh boy, I got nothing.  I got distracted by the cops walking out of the hall.  I thought you said Lady Gaga.  No.  No, no.  Lady Cop.  Oh, wait.  Um, all right.  There you go.  How you doing mushrooms? 
[02:11:00]  I would say that much.  You got a fucking...  He had me my ass.  You got mushrooms stamped.  I did that.  Yes, sir.  But you didn't even, like, try.  It was just like...  Well, he took logic to me right away.  And I was like, ah, fuck.  He basically said, what are you guys talking about?  And you're like, oh, I don't know.  Like, how's that?  Well, you're doing good.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dr. Ian.  Thank you.  Like, before it even started, he goes, are you not using my diet?  And Rolly goes, no, no, I am.  It's like a combination.  It's like a combination. 
[02:11:30]  I went to another time, but I didn't do this.  Yeah, Dr. Ian Smith said, you say something, bitch.  And they went, no, no, no.  You say something, bitch.  He did, man.  Like two of his hoes.  You two.  I double-dicked and mushroom stamped.  Mushroom stamped.  I'll take my dicks and mushrooms and go back.  Right on the fucking forehead.  Dicks and mushrooms are in the book, right?  Part of your diet.  That's right.  Dicks and mushrooms.  All right.  That was terrible.  I screwed up my bad people. 
[02:12:00]  My bad.  Your bad.  My bad.  That was so enjoyable to watch.  Fucking like a cardboard box folding up.  Like a fucking camera.  Just.  You foldy motherfuckers.  Yes.  All right.  Why don't we take a little break?  And.  Well, I got to make peepees.  Yeah, it's time for peepees.  You can take your weed.  Let's share a toilet.  And shove it.  And we'll.  Give it to Opie.  And we'll reconvene.  All right. 
[02:12:30]  Today.  I'm about to love.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  We used to rape Will Fouts.  Just to make him break character.  Because he would never.  He dressed up as character for like two straight weeks.  It was so annoying.  It was so annoying.  Because you're like, Will.  He's like, I'm not Will.  I'm Ron Burgundy.  Let's go.  All right.  Well, Ron.  Can we talk?  He's like, I'm busy this week with art.  And so this went on for weeks and weeks.  And Tracy can never pronounce his name right.  He called him Pharrell.  Will Pharrell.  Hey, Will Pharrell. 
[02:13:00]  He'd be like, let's play characters and break Will Pharrell.  Let's rape him.  Me, Colin Quinn and Tracy repeatedly raped, like fake raped him for hours.  We'd leave him in a dumpster, take his clothes off.  And he would never break character.  It was so obnoxious.  Will would be, Tracy would be in the doorway as we're fake rape.  As we're literally pulling his pants up.  Tracy would be in the doorway with an unlit cigarette going, hurry up and save me some of that.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer. 
[02:13:30]  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  On today's show, Tyra Banks.  Um, I like trannies.  Oh my God, I like trannies too.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  The Opie and Anthony show is back. 
[02:14:00]  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  And better than ever.  On Sirius XM.  Hi there.  Hi there.  Ah, wow.  Eric and Sam were going at it during the break.  Oh my God.  You missed the fireworks.  I did?  Yeah, because Eric's trying to defend himself now.  Oh, please.  We feel like he...  We feel like he heard it.  We were here.  We saw it.  He's back there.  We felt like he folded.  And now, of course, now that the mics are on, he's hiding again. 
[02:14:30]  Because he's fucking with Roland and being like, Roland, you folded.  Yeah, he was making fun of Roland.  And then he's coming in here and being like, I did fine.  Look, Roland is fully admitting that he got mushroom stamps.  He's wearing it like a badge of honor.  Yeah, he's kind of proud of it for some weird reason.  Roland is a character, I'll tell you.  He's a psychopath is what he is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He really is.  A psychopath.  He's nuts.  Oh, my bad.  Oh, yeah.  But Eric was all happy.  Like, he felt like he did well in that whole situation. 
[02:15:00]  He did well.  The whole thing.  He's got hiccups now.  This whole thing.  That's why I know we're doing well.  When you get some hiccups.  Because I was laughing too hard.  Fuck.  This whole thing with Ian Smith is based around the fact that Eric had a problem with him.  Yeah.  Eric folded when Ian Smith was in here.  Folded?  And he folded again with him on the phone.  Why not just say, yeah, I folded.  I'm bad under pressure.  And we talked about how he had folded the first time.  And then, before the Ian Smith call, I actually said, we owed Iraq an apology. 
[02:15:30]  Right.  Because he was talking shit.  And he was talking shit.  And now, it's like, no.  Again, you just folded.  Right.  He gets pathetic.  But then he hides.  Where is he?  As soon as the mics go off, Eric's in here almost every break.  And then, well, he's trying to turn this whole thing around like this is Roland's problem.  Right.  When Ian Smith was on the phone and Roland and Eric weren't in here at first, I caught Eric running around being like, I'm looking for Roland.  I've got to get him in the studio.  Uh-huh.  And I'm like, no, Eric, you have to be in the studio.  Yeah, you're part of it.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, Iraq's lumbering down the hallway.  He's not happy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Iraq comment.  Eric, I just pointed out that you and Sam were going at it a little bit.  It was actually me talking to Roland, and then he had to butt in.  I know.  We all know Sam has to butt in.  I have an opinion on things.  Well, of course you do.  You call it an opinion.  We see it as budding.  Budinsky.  Old Budinsky Roberts.  You're a bit of a Budinsky.  Yeah, but when my opinion is called into question and the person I'm talking about is in the room, I don't just stand quietly and go, I did fine. 
[02:16:30]  What happened, Eric?  You feel like you did well?  I don't like this thing to begin with since I found out he was booked, but I'm doing this thing.  Right.  And then he goes online and complains.  But you were going to lose weight anyway, so this was perfect timing for you.  You already kind of were paying attention to some things.  Getting compliments.  Get some free popcorn.  Right.  Stop trying to find positivity in this. 
[02:17:00]  He complained online.  I don't even know what that means.  I was on the line.  Right.  I love it.  Right.  I'm just stating facts.  I'm not trying to be positive about it.  He had stated online that he wasn't hearing from us all weekend.  And that wasn't true.  Well, here's that part.  Yeah.  Now, you keep saying that.  You say, he says that we weren't getting in touch with him.  You say it's not true, and you say how many times you tried to get in touch.  But when he was on the phone and you were talking, you never said, no, Ian, no.  We were getting in touch with you. 
[02:17:30]  You didn't get in touch back to us.  You just went, yeah, okay.  Yeah, he goes, no, Eric, you're wrong.  And you go, maybe so.  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't say, no, we were trying to get in touch with you.  And go through.  Why weren't we going through the documentation like he said?  If it's on Twitter or what have you, there should be a record of all the tweets and everything.  And he said, oh, let's go through it.  All right.  My opinion on this is not wrong.  I just checked Ian Smith's Wikipedia page.  All right. 
[02:18:00]  It's been updated, Ant.  Oh, it has?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy, has it.  What does Dr. Ian's Wikipedia say?  Well, it says right here, under his talk about being on the President's Council of Fitness and blah, blah, blah.  Nice.  1, 23, 14, at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Wow, okay.  Dr. Ian Smith solidifies his doctorate in mushroom stamping of Eric Nagle and Roland Campos.  If it's on the Wikipedia, it's got to be true.  How does it feel to make a mushroom stamp? 
[02:18:30]  You were mushroom stamped.  Holy shit.  Oh, crap.  You didn't offer one argument to anything he said.  You were very quiet while he was on the phone.  Because most of the argument was Roland's issue.  What about your argument?  But you had an argument that he wasn't being as hands-on as he said.  Right.  You weren't getting the popcorn or the space-age blender that's not built here.  No, that wasn't my complaint.  And he proved that he was in contact with you. 
[02:19:00]  He was reading stuff.  Out of the fact.  He was reading stuff.  But you didn't say any of this.  You never presented that.  Yes, that's what I'm trying to say.  Out of the fact to him.  You know why he did?  Because you folded.  Oh, just folding.  After the fact is when you're coming up with your after the facts.  Old origami Nagle.  It looks like a paper flamingo right now or something.  You're a little dragon.  Oh, my God.  But a good mushroom stamping will straighten you out.  Apparently, that straightens them right out.  That fucking stamp of approval. 
[02:19:30]  And he complains, why aren't you talking to the microphones?  Stamp.  Our point is, you didn't really say anything while I was on the phone.  Apparently, this diet, you could eat as many mushrooms as you fucking have to.  Oh, boy.  Do you get what I was saying, though, about just sitting quietly when you had a complaint?  Yeah, you had an opportunity to at least say something.  Even if it was, wow, I guess you're right.  Or, I don't see it that way.  Or, whatever. 
[02:20:00]  You didn't say anything.  That's our frustration.  I probably should have.  I probably should have now.  That and my bad.  My bad.  These two are fucking...  We got my bad.  I probably should have.  These are the cartoon characters.  Yeah, yeah.  I think you guys just mushroom stamped everything.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Like a fucking...  Like a military flag at a funeral.  Holy fuck. 
[02:20:30]  Just folded and collapsed.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's...  I mean, you guys are doing great on a diet, though.  You know what?  Let's bring some positivity into it.  That's true.  You're doing great.  Sure.  Both of you.  That's a lot of weight to lose.  Both of you is doing great, but as far as not standing up to Dr. Ian Smith and his lying,  I think we heard.  Right.  He was a liar.  Mm-hmm.  Full of shit.  There's something...  Like, any time...  Piece of shit. 
[02:21:00]  Any time Ian Smith is not in the room, for some reason, Eric and Roland have a vendetta  against him, but when he's there or on the phone...  Right, right.  It's like, yes, doctor.  Yes, doctor.  It's fucking bravery second to the fucking people from Lone Survivor.  When Dr. Ian's not on the phone, and then on the phone, you turn into that dumb kid  from Saving Private Ryan that won't take the ammo upstairs.  He's rolling his eyes.  Oh, crap. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  All right, cool.  All right, Iraq.  Oh, wait.  The story's not over.  Oh, no.  What do you mean it's not over?  Has there been another update to the Wikipedia?  Of Dr. Ian Smith?  In his professional career, it still says he solidified his doctorate in mushroom stamping.  But under that, it says, Dr. Ian Smith proved himself to be a master of discourse by effortlessly 
[02:22:00]  dismantling the confidence and bravado of two buffoons through spoken word alone.  Buffoons.  You're one of them.  Let's say hi to Tom in Boston.  Tom.  Hi.  How are you doing?  All right, Tom.  Hey, if you...  I'm sure you guys were there.  I wasn't.  But if you look at the tape, Eric really didn't say much.  Sam is nothing but a shit-stirrer. 
[02:22:30]  Well, Eric didn't say much when Dr. Ian was on the phone.  No, Eric didn't complain much about Ian Smith.  All he said was Ian wasn't getting back to him.  When Ian did get back to him, he responded.  And that was the end of the story.  Sam's been in trouble.  End of the story.  Yeah, but E-Rock did talk a little.  Sam is a shit-stirrer.  He was talking a little shit.  E-Rock was talking, as we like to say, a little jazz beforehand.  Well, maybe he did it off-air.  But from what I heard, Eric really didn't say anything.  Eric has been pissed about those tweets. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  On the air and off the air.  Yes.  Since the tweets were sent out.  Is that fair, Eric?  That is correct.  Okay.  That's all...  The problem is, even if that wasn't true, Sam, you would say it's just the court-stirrer.  Ooh.  That's kind of his job.  Damn it.  Stop defending Sam.  I'm not.  You have no credibility, Sam.  What do I do?  Oh, fuck.  No credibility.  When do I lie?  What do you mean, when do you lie?  You're lying there?  Every time you collect a paycheck.  Oh, shit.  Eric just verified my story about Eric.  Yeah.  There's... 
[02:23:30]  You do not prove Eric is complaining.  Verifiable fact is the replay of the tape.  Eric, were you complaining about his tweets?  He was complaining about his tweets.  Yes.  About Ian Smith complaining that they weren't responding.  Oh, my God.  Sir, I think I've mushroom-stamped you.  Yes.  Yes, sir.  What are you, his lawyer?  Exactly.  All right, Tom.  He's tonsils mushroom-stamped, Tom.  Lucky duck.  Stay strong.  Stay strong.  All right.  Boston's strong.  Boston's strong.  Apparently.  All right.  They're the only city that's allowed to be strong. 
[02:24:00]  That's it.  Only Boston has got to handle adversity.  All right.  Well done, Eric.  Nothing against Boston strong or where that meaning comes from.  Boston's strong.  We're not fans of a state or a city being that special.  Did you see how Iraq left the studio?  He literally, like, folded himself up and slid himself under the door.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  That was great.  They collapsed under Ian's bravado.  So everything's on the record.  Roland collapsed far worse than Eric. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Obviously.  The problem was that Eric wasn't admitting to the collapse.  But Roland had no problem.  And Roland was.  Yeah.  They rolled over.  They acted like the two mobsters talking to fucking Jimmy Serrano on the phone.  Yeah.  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  They really did just fucking give up.  Well.  But they're doing great.  They are.  There's a lot of weight.  So Richard Sherman's talking again, huh?  Yes.  I'm Team Sherman, man.  Me too.  Yeah.  I'm big time Team Sherman on this.  This will be an interesting one to find out where you stand on it. 
[02:25:00]  He's a good enough guy.  He showed a lot of excitement after an amazing conclusion to a great game.  Period.  Too far.  Sorry.  I'm just playing with my teeth.  Are you?  I'll put it back in with you.  This is what Mr. Sherman said yesterday.  The only reason it bothers me is because it seems like it's the accepted way of calling  somebody the N-word nowadays.  You know, it's like everybody else said the N-word and then they say thug and they're like,  oh, that's fine.  And that's where it's kind of, you know, it kind of takes me back and it's kind of disappointing 
[02:25:30]  because they know what's the definition of a thug really.  You know, can a guy on the football field just talking to people, you know, maybe I'm talking  loudly and doing something, you know, talking like I'm not supposed to, but I'm not, you  know, there was a hockey game where they didn't even play hockey.  They just threw the puck aside and started fighting.  I saw that and I said, oh, man, I'm the thug?  What's going on here?  Jeez. 
[02:26:00]  Well, it was a couple things.  It's kind of funny.  Yeah, I'm still Team Sherman.  I'm Team Sherman.  I'll be honest.  It's not a thug, obviously.  I'll be honest with you, though.  I didn't know much about Mr. Sherman before the interview after the end of that game.  When your first impression is just that interview?  My first impression was like, holy fuck, this gangster got into this gangbanger.  I'll be honest.  I'm like, wow, there's a gangbanger in the NFL.  Yeah.  Like a real true life gangbanger.  Right.  Like he was scary.  Yelling. 
[02:26:30]  I loved everything he said, but I'm like, wow, this guy don't fucking play.  He's barely understandable.  Right.  And that's the impression everyone got at first.  And then you do just a little research and you realize he's really not that guy all the  time.  You listen to interviews with him.  When he's competing, he don't play, obviously.  You have to be like that.  But he went to Stanford.  Yeah.  I know a lot of fucking star athletes get that.  Oh, they go to school, but they don't learn much.  They don't have to actually do much.  Right, right.  But it seems like he's actually a really good student. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, smart guy.  He came from a...  Very articulate.  And pulled himself out of a hellhole.  Yep.  Compton.  Compton.  Compton.  Motherfucking Ice Cube.  Man.  Yeah.  So, I mean, to be fair, you can see why a lot of people use the word thug and all that,  because...  That's the first impression.  The first impression was a rough one.  And he's...  For a lot of people.  He's not a thug.  And I don't think you could say thug is a replacement for nigger. 
[02:27:30]  It doesn't...  It's not...  It's two different things.  It honestly is.  His hockey example was good, though.  That is a good example.  Like, you don't...  Because you don't hear those guys...  I don't think it means nigger, but I think it means, like, a black bad guy.  Because you don't hear the hockey players refer to as thug.  It's like, wow, that's what hockey's all about.  You can hear, like, thug...  Yeah, or...  Well, you know what?  An acceptable term is a goon.  Like a fucking...  He's gooning it up on the ice.  He's a goon.  It's different for different instances.  Yeah.  I think black guys that are that over-aggressive kind of... 
[02:28:00]  They'll get the thug label.  Right.  But that's just the way it is.  Like, everybody gets a fucking label put on them.  Everybody!  Everyone!  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  So, I don't know.  I don't buy that that's a replacement word, you know?  But it does seem racial.  Although we do.  We do need a workaround.  I don't think...  I kind of like it as a workaround.  But he's talking about the Twitter haters, right? 
[02:28:30]  Mostly?  Probably?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because that's where it exploded.  Those people...  And the media.  Oh, and the media used it as well.  Okay.  The media call them a thug.  The Twitter people just use the enemy.  That's what I was going to say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're not looking for replacement words yet.  They don't need a code word.  They don't need a code word.  Yeah, they're all in still.  Right, right, right.  Until, like, Twitter decides to do something crazy and start banning words.  Yeah.  And they'll find replacement words.  I hope Twitter doesn't ever go down that road.  Well, I kind of like the way it is.  I'm sure it is.  They'll ruin it.  It's been around a while. 
[02:29:00]  It's been pretty well.  Holding pretty fast.  About five years.  Five.  A little more than five.  But, I mean, it really started getting hot about five years ago.  We've got another great football story.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, boy, do we.  Sticking with the whole Super Bowl motif.  Well, this is our Super Bowl material we're doing for everybody.  Boy, they're petrified about the weather.  Holy shit.  They're starting to realize, wow, maybe this wasn't a good idea.  You see what the Times Square set up for Fox?  And you see everyone's just miserable.  Like, oh, why are we doing this?  This is stupid. 
[02:29:30]  There's a million warm cities.  Why aren't we in Miami?  Right.  God, don't you hope it's like it was.  I hope it's like this.  I so want a blizzard and zero-degree temperatures.  Six degrees?  Yes.  What horrible timing.  Because they started looking at New York thinking, you know what?  The winter's darn really that bad.  What are the odds that it's going to be bad on that day?  Right.  They get hit every once in a while.  But in general, you know, we could easily see temperatures in the 30s or 40s.  That's doable.  As long as you have your hat and your credit card holders. 
[02:30:00]  Holders.  Leg warmers.  Leg warmers.  I guess that audio got passed around a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Within the whole Mike Francesa world.  And the Francesa community.  Yeah, they're loving it.  It is fucking great.  They're loving our breakdown of his Super Bowl gift card.  Have they enjoyed it?  They loved it, yeah.  You need a credit card holder.  You've got to use your credit card holder.  They're mittens, but they've got fingers, so they're gloves.  Fingers.  These are mittens with fingers, so they're Super Bowl gloves.  Super Bowl gloves.  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl hats. 
[02:30:30]  Super Bowl.  He's the greatest.  But they really thought, oh, come on, we could do this.  And man, the one year where we're really getting hit with some real shit.  Some fucking cold weather.  And it's going to be close, right?  This weather's not pushing out for another, at least another four or five days.  I know, but it's going to be close.  This is the winter of the polar vortex.  Look out.  Look out, people.  Would you be happy if it was like minus six and a rain blizzard?  A rain blizzard?  Like just ice falling from the sky. 
[02:31:00]  Just an ice bowl.  Yeah.  Oh, that would be great.  I love that everybody's slipping.  What are they looking at, though?  See?  They might just skate, though.  Yeah, they will.  It'll be 40 and fucking nice.  Next Saturday's 34.  They don't have Sunday up there yet, huh?  Exactly.  They got all the way to next Saturday, and they're saying Saturday will be 34 degrees.  It's so hard to go that far into the future with weather.  You can laugh at the 30s.  30s is still cold, though.  You can laugh.  You can sit in a stadium if it's 35 degrees.  That's nothing.  I'll be sitting in the Kumia Stadium. 
[02:31:30]  That's nothing.  That's where I'll be.  That's where I'll be, too.  Yes, exactly.  I'm going to put a fucking nice rod in my spandex.  Oh, nice.  Why?  I don't know.  Nice rod.  It's just a fun thing.  Why do you move there with spandex?  Spandex.  Why wouldn't you?  I mean, at least I'm not going to wear the white pair this year.  Aunt Fran likes it.  Walk up to my aunt, rub it on her legs.  Watch your cat clod.  Plays with, like, a cat toy. 
[02:32:00]  Right now it says, like, 39 degrees on Sunday.  Yeah, they're going to be fine.  That can change.  That's still pretty fucking car.  It's way too far.  But all the activities start now.  Like, Times Square, right outside this fucking building.  They got all sorts of shit set up.  Roads are going to be shut down.  I've never seen them get the weather right when you're talking longer than a week.  Oh, I haven't.  You know?  No, yeah.  A lot could change.  But they're starting to figure it out that far in advance.  They are getting better at it.  But, I mean, they're starting to figure that shit out.  They have their models. 
[02:32:30]  They're like, oh, our computer models are showing.  I don't know if they can figure out snowstorms that far in advance.  No, that's just it.  Shit starts, you know, fucking mingling.  It just blows up.  And, yeah, things start twirling around in the sky.  Oh, what's going over here?  We didn't see that swirling yesterday.  Well, that swirl is mingling with that swirl.  Oh, no.  And now they're a couple.  This could be dangerous.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, we got a football story.  You want to hear this one? 
[02:33:00]  I certainly do.  We'll go into this one cold.  Burr.  A teammate learned that...  I'm an idiot.  Everything's a pun or a fucking joke or a...  But burr.  The cold sound.  Of course, it's cold.  Going into this cold.  Burr.  A teammate learned that Lombardi had picked me up off waivers and said that you're going  to love the Redskins and you're going to love all the people and especially you're going 
[02:33:30]  to love Jerry Smith.  And he says, he's your kind of guy.  And I thought, wow, that was interesting.  One night when we did get together and we were out drinking and one thing led to another,  all of a sudden there was Jerry in bed with me and loving me and maybe I was still buzzed  or whatever, but I thought this was really good.  At least I was sharing something of myself with someone who was close and understood 
[02:34:00]  all that I had been through and understood so much of what we hoped for would come, you  know?  And that's where we left it.  And that never happened again.  What the fuck was that?  That was David Copay.  He played for the Redskins.  Back in the 60s.  Yeah, the late 60s, early 70s.  And he had a one night stand with a closet teammate named Jerry Smith. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, it's like a documentary on Jerry Smith.  Jerry Smith went on to die of AIDS in 1986.  Oh, jeez.  Well, that's certainly not funny, but...  Damn.  I was sweating, though, when Jerry dropped.  He's like, oh my God, he fucked me in the ass in a holiday.  This is him.  Is he the guy that died of AIDS?  No, this is the guy you just heard from.  Oh, well, who could blame Jerry?  That looks like Matthew McConaughey for pizza.  How do you end up...  Boy, I've had some drunken bangers. 
[02:35:00]  I don't understand the one thing that led to another.  One thing that just led to another.  Wasn't that great that Vince Lombardi was like, he's your kind of guy?  He's your kind of guy.  So what?  Is this guy openly gay?  Yeah, I guess he's openly gay, too.  And they were teammates that were closeted.  So Vince Lombardi just knew.  Was the guy sucking his cock or making love to his ass?  They didn't say.  They never get into the details, do they?  Supposedly this guy on the line produced the documentary we were talking about. 
[02:35:30]  Come on.  What are the odds?  Paul in Jersey, go ahead.  Hey, Paul.  Is this real?  This is real.  How are you guys?  All right, buddy.  Thanks for talking about it.  I actually called you guys on Tuesday to talk about this, and I was on hold.  And then Lady Di went on a rant, and I hung up.  Well, we have our priorities, sir.  God, I hope she calls now.  I understand that 100%.  Or Bubba.  That'd be cool.  But this is a documentary we did on Jerry Smith, who was a great player, and ended up,  he was gay, and he was one of the best tight ends. 
[02:36:00]  Isn't that always funny?  We get it.  It's a tight end thing.  It is.  Hilarious.  It was tough.  You sure he wasn't a wide receiver?  Yeah.  Yeah, Betty with a quarterback.  That doesn't make any sense, Jeff.  It airs again today at 3 o'clock on NFL Network, if anybody listened.  NFL Network.  I did hear it's pretty good.  So congratulations to you, sir.  I guess that was probably impossible to even think about coming out back then. 
[02:36:30]  If you're a football player, it still is.  No, and it was a quote.  We had a fight.  We found a news clipping of the NFL director of security who compared it to espionage that  they were afraid that if they had gay players in the NFL, that they would be compromised.  Compromised?  Oh.  Thank you, sir.  Not in that way.  I hear you.  I think we've lost interest. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Now I just don't even care.  Well, thanks, Paul.  Thank you.  We'll take a look at that on the NFL Network.  Wow.  That is some disturbing audio.  That came out of nowhere, huh?  And that, again, is one of those situations where, as a straight guy, you kind of listen  to that, and it hits you wrong.  Yeah.  I'm not anti-gay.  I'm not, you know, against the gay rights or gay marriage or anything like that. 
[02:37:30]  But when you hear that, as a guy, you get this kind of vibe going.  And that's just this natural occurrence.  You know, what are you going to do?  Isn't it?  Yeah.  Just jerk off.  I do like that he kept it classy, though, and he said, well, we were in bed loving each  other.  Loving each other.  Loving each other.  That, to me, sounds disturbing. 
[02:38:00]  Just the loving part.  Love.  Yeah.  Like beard rubbing.  That beard rubbing that the big bear men do.  They have beards, and they rub them together on each other.  I think Fez and fucking Dave did that once.  Yeah, I don't get that.  It was really disturbing.  Really disturbing.  And they were all in with it, too.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  New video of what?  Justin Bieber's arrest?  My God.  ...in these pictures, but that is the car.  Police stopped him when he was allegedly drag racing down the streets of Mike. 
[02:38:30]  He's just a loser.  He is a fucking dick.  Complete and utter loser, Justin Bieber.  He wants to be cool.  Oh, that's all.  He's looking for...  He's looking for attention.  What the fuck?  You saw Dave being all dreamy.  This is disturbing.  It's so bad.  And it looks like 8mm film.  Does it?  It looks like some serial killer shot.  It seems like...  Yeah, they put, like, glitches in it and stuff and bad music.  There's Fez.  They're both wearing tighty-whities. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, tighty-whities.  And now Fez is crawling up and they're rubbing and Dave making that dumb smiley face he makes.  I'm convinced that he makes that face to stop himself from laughing.  You think that's it?  Because...  This is too weird.  Oh, Christ.  What the fuck?  Yeah, it's jumping the film.  It looks like film.  Well done.  God.  70s gay porn type thing. 
[02:39:30]  That's so bad.  How do you...  How do you do this as a goof?  It's like...  You want to do it?  No.  I don't even mean you.  You saw Dave as one of the rare exceptions that he could do this shit as a goof.  And you just laugh.  Yeah.  Look at him laughing.  Look at Dave.  Look at his...  Look at his chest going up.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got to shut his eyes and...  He's laughing. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, God.  Now...  Fez is running his fingers through.  Oh, my God.  He's got Dave's chest hair.  And they're rubbing their beards together.  It's horrible.  I would hate that.  It really is.  Oh, my God.  Now, Fez is going down, like, to his underwear.  His tighty-whities that are pulled all the way up to his belly button. 
[02:40:30]  I'll bet you at least one person has jerked off to this.  Mm-hmm.  I think it made...  Didn't Ronnie talk about how it made gay sites or something?  Yeah, that's right.  I don't remember, but...  I don't remember, but...  Yeah, no, I don't remember, but...  Yeah, I think it did make some gay sites.  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.  Yeah.  That's disturbing, man.  Jimmy's going to Atlanta a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Punchline this weekend, right?  Tonight, tomorrow.  Ticket sale's very good.  Awesome.  Ticket sale's amazing in D.C.  I think I'm 80% sold out already.  Ooh. 
[02:41:00]  Good to fucking hear.  And late show at the Borgata on sale now at 10.30.  The other two are sold out.  Nice.  So it's February 15th.  Fun, fun.  Yeah.  And our latest podcast, go get number 37.  It's our interviews with Ice Cube and Jerry Springer.  Noises!  Hey, I'm Jerry Springer.  Welcoming you back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, I don't know if I should be associated with these guys. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Just got a good wipe in.  Nice wipe.  A nice wipe will straighten you right up.  You got to freshen up?  Nice wipe.  You know, it's funny.  I was having trouble shitting before.  That's why I was gone for that part of the world break.  Yeah.  And I tweeted this the other day, but it felt like I was trying to shit a ham hock wrapped  in bubble gum.  Like, it was just one of those thick ones that you can't get out. 
[02:42:00]  And it's here to be like a fucking 20-minute wipe.  Where you can't squeeze it down?  Yeah.  It's got to pass the fucking, the midpoint, the wide point.  It's like trying to form, fucking push lukewarm chocolate through a keyhole.  This is not going to be pretty.  Why aren't they arrested?  What?  Yes.  In the last time of the heist.  When Jimmy the Gent Burke, who was played by Robert De Niro, masterminded a $6 million  robbery in cash and jewels on a tip that they got that a plane was coming in to JFK airport. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, we know the story.  No arrests were ever made.  Wow.  They just busted.  But the suspects along the way kept disappearing, shall we say.  Now we can confirm that five arrests have taken place, including Vincent Massaro, a reputed  member of the Bonanno crime family.  Bo Dietl joins us live on this.  And Arthur Idalla is on the phone.  Gentlemen, welcome.  Good to have you here.  This is breaking.  The other names on this list are Jerome Massaro, Tommy DeFiore, and John Bazzuragano and Jack 
[02:43:00]  Bunventer.  You grew up with the Gent, Jimmy the Gent, and you were in the movie Goodfellas.  What do you think about all this, Bo?  Well, you know, the statute of limitation on murder, there is none.  You know, everyone would say, well, how can they lock them up?  They're 78 years old, some of them.  But if there was a part of a conspiracy to commit murder, now you've got to remember,  after the Uftaza heist, there was, I think, about 15 people ended up dying.  So in other words, what was happening, bodies were popping up all over the place. 
[02:43:30]  Jimmy Burke could not become a made member.  Tommy DeSimone was the guy that he wanted to become a made member.  And with the Paul Vario crew.  And he's played by, Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeSimone.  And Jimmy Burke is played by Robert De Niro.  Now, Robert De Niro was playing Jimmy Burke, who's Irish.  So you can't get the made, you know, made a man.  So what happened was then Burke started wiping out people because he didn't want to share the  money. 
[02:44:00]  And he started whacking everybody and he was just popping up all over the place.  And we all remember the scene when they, the women all walked into the bar wearing new  coats and driving fancy new cars.  Yes.  And they were really upset about it because they knew it was going to draw attention to  these guys and it might get them caught, but they didn't.  Robert, what do you know about this whole thing?  Robert, what do you know about this whole thing?  What's the matter with you?  I can't believe you have such a knowledge of the movie Goodfellas.  Good for you.  It's one of my very favorite movies of all time.  Fantastic movie.  Here's a deal from the legal aspect of it.  Obviously, trying to prove any case that's 40, almost 40 years old, is not an easy task. 
[02:44:30]  however the feds don't usually lock people up until they have always a weird fucking arrest  so be honest well what sparked it was they they searched jimmy the burke's burke's home  and they found body parts in his yard the biggest thing is that so much money was stolen and yet it  was never recovered to this day the actual cash was real greaseball shit so it's going to be  interesting to see um you know how they go after what i would call these broken down old guys i 
[02:45:00]  mean they're all 78 80s with your old men at this point uh but not to budget for them to come  to arrest these guys they must have a case you're looking at them that they feel you know that's  viable real quick both after you know when i worked in the 75 detective squad doing homicides over there  i actually brought jimmy burke from allenwood on two murders that henry hill gave him up for henry  hill was the rat so i i don't understand there were people that were arrested for this henry hill was  an informant and a rat he gave up things and i had a rearrest henry hill i had a rearrest 
[02:45:30]  i could talk about it all day we gotta go we'll be right back why do they always have  why does it always have to be just completely timed out breaks no because they gotta you know  do their commercials and then they gotta come back and talk about justin bieber of course  they've got other things yeah wow that's unbelievable that's was from 78 obviously  yeah you really think you skated after 30 all those years right i think ah 36 years all right  you're good you've sat you've watched the movie a thousand times you've chuckled you think you're  okay yeah it's like jumping on a cake and then all of a sudden eight years ago later people 
[02:46:00]  oh god damn it exactly gotta deal with that still oh man yeah that's crazy yeah watching goodfellas  knowing her hey it's about me hey right remember that but you really can't find but for a lot of  years you can't really say that no i'm sure you tell them you know talk to your other buddies that  were involved right that's about hey yeah remember that thing the thing they made a movie about that  thing the movie about the thing oh yeah huh they said it took uh it was like a half a dozen guys uh 
[02:46:30]  and 64 minutes to commit the burglary it's a long time to commit a burglary but i guess the guy was  you know you know comment on you're looking at him it's me mike star that guy's name guy was great  he was in everything yeah mike star was in fucking everything uh like you see him pop up in like  nicholson movies and all these weird places and i did uh uh one my one episode of fucking ed that i

[02:51:30]  just a supercut you know how we were talking about thug and goons and uh see they would be  considered what is called a hooligan right they're hooligans right and that's just another form of  crazy you know but that's a white it's a white thing to be a hooligan you could be a sot  a hooligan he's a sot a hooligan they're crazy what about a sot can you be a sot you could be a sot  nice yeah all right let's listen to the supercut the noel gallagher supercut 
[02:52:00]  this video was um this video was shot on top of a hotel in uh opposite king's cross station  i always started to be a bit more glamorous when we got there making videos you know  not like nowadays dizzy rascal and all that they got a balbados and stuff what was i dressed like  now i look like fucking columbo i don't know what that's about i had a good laugh doing this video 
[02:52:30]  there's a sign of manchester city football worth virtually nothing  yeah matey boy soon gave up singing the uh the falsetto a bit after that i think he thought it  was a bit gay a bit gay  it's funny i'd kind of grown i'd i'd grown out of the video experience  quite quickly by the third one it was just like this is a load of bollocks 
[02:53:00]  standing around all day doing the same old shit 500 times  that'd be weird but um it seems like this guy was just making it up as he was fucking going  along because i did this bit where they were gonna he was saying um we should bury the drum  kit and i'm saying why don't we bury the drummer and he was like yeah yeah we'll fucking bury  the drummer i was like wow is how easy this is  suggesting nonsense and people's going to film it suggesting nonsense 
[02:53:30]  fuck me there's a lot of adidas going on in here  i said really all these birds in this video it's like a fucking scene from britain's next top model  don't get away with that now the missus wouldn't let you do a video like that now would she  be fucking uproar what do you mean there was fucking 60 pissed up birds in the toilet  well hang on a minute what's all that about 
[02:54:00]  i never got off with that girl there by the way there's no chance of that see how  fit she was  that's uh all for the all for the video i'm afraid  no i was fucking drunk  look how pissed i am there  he's pissed  that's me really pissed  and uh i remember sitting down in the middle of the street i think it might have been on  edgware road somewhere  i'm falling asleep 
[02:54:30]  at a bus stop  and then i'm and then going  that they're the clothes i went out  in the night the night before  i remember lian being furious that day because i think it's the one the one time i've been more drunk than he has  do you never get involved with the ideas  no i i really i fucking hate videos i hate everything about them i hate the fact that they cost a fortune  i hate the fact that you've got to be there at eight in the morning  i hate the fact that you don't leave until eight the fucking next morning  huh 
[02:55:00]  i don't like the fact  that the people who are making them think they're fucking making apocalypse now  that looks great  and everything is the most important this is the really important shot and this bit we're getting is fucking bollocks it's nonsense  and even then it was all right because there's like the chart show and all that you know what i mean  you fucking watch his videos these days  no one  a right fucking con if you ask me  we never really  fucking that's probably the last time i ever had my  i was i can't begin to tell you how pissed i was i was shit-faced 
[02:55:30]  that song's a bit of a throw away for me although we did play it on our last tour and people did go fucking apeshit for it  it is a bit it is  it is a good song to jump up and down to drunk  let's have it right  see that guy on the end on the far left  that's a guy called scott mcleod cause gwiggs bless him  had er developed lazy-itis  er masquerading as er nervous exhaustion 
[02:56:00]  whatever that means maybe he's having a nervous breakdown i don't know  our tour manager come to the front of the bus one night and said that er she'd been talking to scott and he wants to go home  and we were like what do you mean you wanna fucking go home  and he said he was missing his girlfriend  we were on the way to do david letterman for the first time and er he just said i wanna go home i miss me mates and i miss me girlfriend  oh shit 
[02:56:30]  and i was like your girlfriend fucking on you play cards right here you'll have about six girlfriends by the end of this fucking tour mate never mind the one back home in fucking olden  that wasn't an actual record playing by the way and he's not a real clown  i mean i hate videos at the best of times which we've already spoke about  but actually being in a video where you're the actual fucking supposed to be the front man is just the biggest pain in the fucking arse ever  you know a guy actually said to me on this video shoot 
[02:57:00]  can we do that bit again but can you  can you do it with a bit more energy in your eyes  i still have no idea what he meant by that to this day  i don't know  i don't know do you want me to fucking stare at you like a fucking serial killer  i don't know  nonsense  and you'd have thought  fucking braggar shark that waste of a fucking afternoon  he really got helicopters that cost a fucking fortune  this is fucking nonsense 
[02:57:30]  is this real? is this a real video?  the size of bonehead's shirt that's fucking insane  you don't like me wearing someone else's clothes in all these videos  is that phil mitchell?  no it's not  yeah i'm not having any of this  is this leading up to something? have you seen this video?  er it's all backwards 
[02:58:00]  oh  alright pity the song is that might have sounded a bit more interesting  i have to say in all these videos if you need four guys to walk around in slow motion  we were the fucking we were the best at that  maybe the motorbike's rushing to the radio station to say stop this is shit  ha ha ha  this is shit  it was hilarious  fucking hell  done that a few times 
[02:58:30]  so she's dead alright so there's a death in the video that's nice  what he said what the...  what the..  Why'd they end up in hospital? And who's that helmet? Was she on the bike? Hang on a  minute. If anybody's listening to this at home, it'd be advised to probably go and fucking  mow the garden somewhere, cause this goes on for ages. For ages.  You lost that sea well out that you drowned.  They are really ill-fitting suits as well, aren't they. Fucking hell. And I bet they 
[02:59:00]  cost a fucking fortune. Robbie Williams based his entire fucking career  on this song, that's what I hate about this. Is that a man with legs made of sausages?  That's not real. Someone's having a fucking- I know for a fact that's got nothing to do 
[02:59:30]  with this song. A man with legs made of sausages. Fucking hell. There's something about that  English accent that makes this ten times better. Right. Yeah. Oh, lord.  This was an epic. Good lord. Shut up. Shut up. Good lord, shut up.  No, that's horrible. What are you talking about?  That's not real. Jumping out of that place. What about pigs don't fly and never say die? 
[03:00:00]  That's surely- somebody- why did somebody fucking stop me at that point and say, look, this is-  he's gone on holiday.  Well enough on this video shoot, right, it was shot in the middle of summer, it fucking  pissed down for two- it pissed down for two days, it wasn't supposed to piss down, we  thought we were gonna get electrocuted under that thing there that was supposed to look  like a spaceship. Lying bastards. That's supposed to be a spaceship taking off. It looks like 
[03:00:30]  a lot of scaffolding's sinking. Oh, this is fucking- this is another-  It's just all begging. Can we listen to this with the sound down?  Yeah. I'm very uninspired at this point, you know,  I was- we shouldn't have really made this album, if I'm being- if I'm being honest.  I mean, walking- walking in videos is f- somebody's sussed out there, aren't they? At some point,  like ten years into it, all they're prepared to do is walk. They'll walk and play. They- they 
[03:01:00]  can walk and play at the same time. But walking and playing is basically what they're doing,  and standing still, and looking bored.  Thank god that's over. What was the next one off this- oh, fucking hell. Oh, fucking hell.  Oh, I fucking hate this next tune. I really fucking hate it.  Fucking hell. 
[03:01:30]  It just doesn't seem to be going anywhere. I don't know what I was thinking at the time.  Particularly if you think of the late- the stuff that's gone,  before the fuck are these people. That's exactly how I feel, mate.  She's trying to get some cd player. I had to turn it off. 
[03:02:00]  Fucking dreadful. Wow. Hey, man. I don't even know if that- I just- I don't even know if that worked,  but holy fuck. You gotta see the videos, I think. No- well, Noel Gallagher is breaking down all his  videos. Yeah, and some of the songs and stuff. Being completely honest. Yeah. Bollocks. I always  wondered about that, because some of the stuff in these videos were like, what? Yeah. Was it the  vision of the band, or the director? Like he said, that guy has sausage legs, has nothing to do with 
[03:02:30]  this song. He jumped into an animated fucking pit, and the sky was down there, and he's like, that's not  real. Like, of course. Of course. We didn't think it was. I like that he doesn't even like all the  songs. No, no. Like, not even the videos. A couple of the songs he hated. Well, his personality never  really matched up with the band he was in. Yeah, yeah. He seems like he should have been in, like,  kind of a hardcore punk band or something. Right. Holy shit. Right? That's some funny stuff. Yeah, 
[03:03:00]  absolutely. I've seen- I've seen other bands comment on their early videos. I think- Oh, that'd be  fun. I gotta check out some of those. Def Leppard was talking about that one where-  What the hell is that one? Pour some sugar? No, it's one of the real early ones where he's got the  sword, and he's walking this, like, women in cages and shit. Right, right, right, right. And he was  talking about how ridiculous that is. Like, oh, God, we're just taking girls and put them in cages,  and if there was swords in a- They had these bands, though. They pretty much held them hostage to make 
[03:03:30]  these videos. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, they were bloody expensive. And to make the video,  like he was saying, just 24 hours of- Right. Going through the song a thousand times. Like they're  making an Oscar. Yeah, because normally they don't- Oscar-winning movie. They don't do the video  in chronological order and, you know, okay, he's by the beach, and then he's here, he's here. Like, 
[03:04:00]  they'll do the whole song on the beach. Right. And then they'll do the whole song where he's  fucking in an airplane. Right. And then the whole song again where he's there. And then they'll just  piece all of those together and make a video- Right. Out of it. So you have to stand there and lip-sync  the song thousands of times. I bet you there's a lot of artists that are so happy they don't have to make-  videos anymore. Yeah. Or as many. Yep. You got to make a video for every song because you didn't  know which song was going to hit either. Yeah. Early in your career, I bet it's all exciting and fun  and everything. Sure. But then after you've done it for a while, you're already famous. You're selling 
[03:04:30]  albums. It doesn't matter. It's got to be the most annoying fucking thing. Right. Right. Just again,  stand there. Too good. That's a good one. All right. Noel. Noel Gallagher. I always thought they were  assholes. They're like having the world by the balls and they can't fucking hold it together  kind of a thing. They were one of those bands. It's like, dude, just shut up. They held together  for a long time. They did, but there was always like a turmoil. Where are they at now, Travis? Do you 
[03:05:00]  know? Are they both touring as Oasis, but the one guy can't say Oasis? Is that it? I think-  When they do that. Well, last time we talked about it, I believe Liam could tour as Oasis, but Noel can't  or something, even though they're brothers. I know Noel got a band and I think on their last tour,  he finally started playing some Oasis songs. Right. I think. Yeah. I think that's where  the last we left these guys. I would have an album cover. If I couldn't use the name,  I'd have an album cover of a girl kind of across the room and I'd be raising my hand up looking at 
[03:05:30]  her and I'd call it. Oh, hey, sis. How about that? It's like, it's your sister. Just so they know who,  you know, they get it. Right. Pick up the new Oasis. Oasis. Sal's reminding me,  the name of the band is BDI and it's basically Oasis without Noel. Really? Yeah.  What other bands are like that? Like wasn't Credence split for a while and they came back  together. They couldn't use the name. Who's the one that had to sue himself? Yeah, that was a few. 
[03:06:00]  Was that CCR? Yeah, that was- Fogarty did. Yeah. Jump Fogarty. Fogarty had to sue himself.  There were other guys that like can't use the band's name.  Oh, didn't that happen with the Doors or something? Like- Oh yeah, yeah.  Didn't Ray Manzark like tour as the Doors, but then he had to change the name? Yeah, yeah.  Right. They did it. Pink Floyd had to work something. Pink Floyd,  there was another problem with Pink Floyd, yeah. I think like Roger Waters. I think they'd separate 
[03:06:30]  it by album though. Roger Waters, Pink Floyd or something like that. Like Roger Waters could  just do The Wall or something like that. Yeah. Let's say hi to Bobby in New York. Bobby!  Hey, Bobby. What's up, Bobby? Not that you probably even care, but Liam and Noel, they tour separately.  Liam tours with BDI and he wasn't selling very much, so he wasn't doing Oasis songs because he  wanted to do his whole new thing. And then since he wasn't selling well, then he started to do Oasis songs.  Yeah, no shit. Yeah, of course. Then you don't hate it as much. Like, oh, fuck. Judas, bit of bollocks. 
[03:07:00]  Right. I think that's Bobby the Champ. Noel has a band called Noel Gallagher's High Flying Burrs.  He actually did a new album, and it's pretty good. And he does some-  No, yeah. Is it reasonable?  And he sold out, you know, a couple shows at, what's the theater uptown?  I'm more interested in the fact that Sam said this is Bobby the Champ.  Okay, it is. Who are you? Oh, who's that? 
[03:07:30]  Why do we have to do this every time? Sam, I swear to you, I don't know who Bobby the Champ is.  I have no idea. That's what I was hoping for. Who's Bobby the Champ?  I don't even, I didn't even hear him anymore after you said this is Bobby the Champ.  Who's Bobby the Champ? Who's Bobby the Champ?  I would assume he used to work here. He was your intern. Okay.  Which one? What's he? He was Bobby the Champ.  By me. Okay. Hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm going to try really hard.  Yeah. Like, does he have a standout bit? Yep. Okay. 
[03:08:00]  Does it have to do with the Champ name? No.  Uh-huh. I know people at home probably think we're trying to-  No, no. Not at all. I have no idea who this is.  I vaguely remember the name because you bring it up every time. Right.  But I don't know who he is. But I have to, I remind you every time and he means so little  that you just erase him from your memory. Tall guy? No.  Short guy? Uh, I would say on the shorter side.  Bat? When we were, yeah, he was a little chubby when he was interning here. 
[03:08:30]  Bobby the Champ did something. No clue. I swear.  Did you hear that don't make the panda angry? That was Sal. He works here. Oh, right.  Okay. Bobby the Champ. Did I throw strawberries at him? No, you did not. Oh.  Hmm. Julie. No, that was, that was, uh, no, same, same kid as the strawberry champs.  Bobby, what'd you do for our show that we would remember? I did a few things. Uh, No Homo  was probably the most- He created No Homo. He didn't create No Homo. He brought No Homo 
[03:09:00]  to the show. In what way? Because he was sucking someone's dick and he looked up and said No Homo?  No Homo. No, he started touching the employees and then saying No Homo and the employees complained  and you guys had never heard the phrase before. I kind of remember this. This was back in the  old studio. Yes. He would touch guys. And go, No Homo. Why were you touching guys, Bobby?  I do remember this. Uh, mostly attention. All right. But why would you do that? How would you 
[03:09:30]  touch guys and say No Homo? I mean, just mean softly on the shoulder, back of the neck. I  thought it was kind of a funny- You want to slap an ass or grab a thigh? Okay, listen. This is where  I'm at with Bobby the Champ. I do remember that. I remember that. I'm trying to keep this honest,  but I don't remember what he looked like. I can't remember what he looked like. But I do remember  that we were like, this kid is fucking weird. Do you want to hear a refresher? Huh? Do you want to hear a clip?  Uh, what? Him doing Bobby the Homo? I mean, Bobby whatever. I don't think he ever went by Bobby the 
[03:10:00]  Homo. Bobby the Champ, I mean. Yeah, this clip, by the way, is eight years old. Eight years? How are we  supposed to remember something from eight years ago? I guess I reminded you like six months ago. What  else has Bobby the Champ done for the Opie and Anthony organization? He also got drunk and went to the  studio and played with Anth's shit. I wasn't drunk. That wasn't- Well, that's what somebody's saying.  Okay. He wasn't drunk, but he is the one who started doing a terrible Ronald Reagan impression 
[03:10:30]  into your megaphone after his show, and he was on your blacklist from then on. Oh, nice. Give me a-  Show me a picture of Bobby the Champ. I also threw up eggs, and Jay Moore also jumped on me naked,  and I took a mousetrap to the tongue. Bobby, when you took a mousetrap to the tongue, did you realize  that Opie and Anthony would have no recollection as to who you were? Yeah, I pretty much knew that.  Oh, good. Oh, okay. That's good. I know you call every once in a while. What are you doing now,  Bobby the Champ? I work in finance. So glad the radio thing worked out for you. Yeah, that's nice. 
[03:11:00]  I still get to listen to the radio, I guess. Jesus. Finance is all right. What the hell? High finance?  Yeah, I guess. No. You wouldn't be on the phone with us. No. Is the market just about open? Yeah,  right? What are you doing? I do okay. Wouldn't you be ready to go? Yeah, why isn't,  why aren't you, the market's fucking rocking right now? We can't even find a picture of you. I'm in at  830. You know how hard it is to be erased from the internet? You have been erased from the internet. 
[03:11:30]  Dude, everything's on the internet. And we can't find one picture of Bobby the Champ.  Victor, yeah. There's got to be a video of me. There's a video of me on YouTube throwing up eggs.  Okay. Throwing up eggs. Why did you do that? Because you guys wanted me to. Come on. What  was the contest? What was the bit? Some, some other dude brought in eggs for like an egg eating  contest. I don't know. And you, you, you know, shit all over there. Oh, are you the,  are you the guy that was really old and drove like a hundred miles every day? No, that was, that was,  oh, that was this guy. No, I think that's the guy that brought the eggs in. Oh, see, I do remember that guy. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah. I think some accidentally got thrown at him. Well, it might, it might've happened.  How old was he? He was our oldest intern at what? How old was he again? No,  he's not the oldest intern we've ever had. Who was our oldest intern? Uh, 47,  I think was the oldest intern. Who was that? He was, I think. Oh, I remember him.  He was like an electrician or something. I don't know. He was like a gray haired.  Was his name Scott? Yes. Scott. I have no idea. What is he doing now? 
[03:12:30]  And you probably went back to being an electrician. I'm retired. Yeah. Retired.  One of our interns are retired. Yeah. There you go. Uh, you found Bobby the champ. I searched,  I scoured the internet. Okay. Bobby the intern vomits. That's him. Wearing the Rhine and Fez t-shirt.  Oh wait, he looks kind of familiar now. I recognize you. Oh yeah. He was a real goofball.  You, you actually retweeted me this weekend. Oh. Oh. What was your tweet? It was the, uh, 
[03:13:00]  pape, the post of the news from when you got fired. All right. And, uh, yeah.  Ah, you're puking. Oh, that's disgusting. I just ate a bunch of eggs and peeps. That's  fucking disgusting. Aren't we doing like, uh, Cool Hand Luke or something? I think that was Cool Hand  Luke Day. I think you were trying to, but then the intern, instead of bringing in hard-boiled eggs,  brought in a whole bunch of raw eggs. Brought in raw eggs. Right. Well, they were half cooked.  Weren't they were like, he couldn't even like boil the eggs right? And that's when we got mad and  started throwing the eggs at him. Throwing the eggs at him. Whose idea wasn't to play the 
[03:13:30]  Carpenters as he was puking? I was just hearing, so I was playing Carpenters music while he was  throwing them. Well, you know, I mean, that's great. I feel weird thrown up in front of Iraq's hero.  Yeah, I got a line in. That's funny. Yeah. He got a little fucking funny, uh,  Iraq line in there. And you're puking up eggs.  With the carpenter's playing. More carpenter's playing.  That's great. Because he's vomiting. Carpenters. 
[03:14:00]  She died of anorexia. He's forcing himself to throw up eggs.  Yeah, because he would puke. Eric, anything on this? Not on Bobby, but the kid who you threw the eggs at?  Yeah. Guy. Uh, his name was Tim. He lived up near Boston. He was working at a supermarket,  plus had a wife and kid. Yeah, and he drove down every day. Right, right.  From Boston? He didn't drive from Boston. It was near Boston. Up on the outskirts.  Yeah. He would drive down. Toward New York, I guess. And he would like sleep in his car. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah. I remember he drove like over a hundred miles a couple times a week just to be our intern.  I think Bobby, I think I told Bobby once he was like every bad helper I ever had when I was knocking 10.  No, that definitely wasn't me. I was actually, if you ask Kenny, I was like, I did actually a decent job.  I don't mean you. Well, you don't have to brag about your job now.  You got coffee well?  Yeah, come on. You couldn't have done that well. Intern David did a better job. We all know who he is.  Was Bobby the one that we busted playing with Ant's megaphone? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, we were just talking about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about the kid that we shaved his eyebrows? Whatever happened to him?  Remember him? We lost touch. Yeah, yeah.  Is he another one that we lost? What do you mean?  He doesn't want to acknowledge that he ever was here.  No, no, no. I think he's fine with being here.  Who's on the I don't want to acknowledge I ever was here intern list?  Number one, I think is intern David. Yeah.  Because there's only been one intern who, if you see him on the street, Opie, he will run in the opposite direction.  I was having breakfast with either Brewer or Patrice O'Neal. I'm trying to remember which one. 
[03:15:30]  And he walked right by the window. It wasn't even a window. It was an open cafe, but we were inside.  So we were right next to the sidewalk. And he panicked. He saw me and he ran away.  He ran away. Literally.  Yeah, I saw it myself. And then a lot of other people have seen the same thing themselves.  And I don't know why he doesn't want to be associated with the show.  He was great. Yeah.  Cream Pie Jones wants nothing to do with the show.  Oh boy, does Cream Pie not like his tenure here? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah. I mean, he's even got shit to plug.  And I've told him, look, just come on the show and let us talk to you. You can plug your shit.  What kind of shit does he need to plug?  I'm not going to mention it.  You got him on the show.  I remember you got him on once under the guise that you wanted to talk about school and nothing else.  Yeah, and I'll never forget his response to my first question, which was,  I was told he wanted to talk about Syracuse.  Syracuse.  Syracuse.  Syracuse.  And then he started asking him other stuff and he's like, I will not talk about that.  And then hung up.  And hung up. 
[03:16:30]  What happened to Cream Pie?  He's got like a little, he's got a little business that I'm not going to mention the name of.  What, what area?  It's a, uh, uh.  From Circles?  No.  What does he got?  It's a beverage company.  Oh, Jesus.  Not an adult beverage.  His company?  I don't know.  He's one of the, yeah.  Do you drink it out of a duty hat?  Do you turn over the duty hat and it comes, the cap on it is a little duty hat.  Maybe that's what he's worried about.  That'd be great.  He does not like being reminded of that.  Of a duty hat that he reached into a toilet with shit in it. 
[03:17:00]  You know what's amazing about life?  Cream Pie Jones was the biggest Opie and Anthony fan I had ever met.  Oh my gosh, right?  When I got in the internship, he was like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  I'm meeting my heroes.  This is amazing.  I love the hero stuff.  I love it.  You guys were his many heroes.  And he just doesn't want any connection.  Doesn't want to talk about it.  Doesn't want to acknowledge it. 
[03:17:30]  No.  Holy fuck.  I like how we started out as your intern for your college radio show.  That's right.  And then Sam brought him in.  Cream Pie.  Well, that's when you knew.  He didn't realize that when you're in college, you can just get a radio show.  The interns get to host the show.  You don't need to be an intern for a college radio show.  That's the host.  Right.  Sorry, Bobby, that we spent your time talking about other interns.  Yeah.  Right.  It was good catching up again.  What is he doing now?  Finance.  Puking on eggs or something.  All right. 
[03:18:00]  High finance.  Bobby, I'm going to really try to remember you next time you call.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  If you want, you can just follow me on Twitter.  That would help me out a lot.  Oh, what's your Twitter?  I bet he was going to say it.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to remind you next time he calls.  Hey, that's Bobby the Champ on the phone.  And you're going to give me that same look.  Like, why are you interrupting the show to tell me something?  I don't know what you're talking about.  I almost remembered him this time.  You did?  Yeah, almost. 
[03:18:30]  I remember when I saw his face.  Yeah, almost.  But you remember Cream Pie Jones.  Oh, my God.  Of course.  Cream Pie's a legendary intern.  Let me tell you the interns I remember.  Okay.  David, Cream Pie Jones, Eyebrow Kid.  But you don't remember anything but Eyebrow Kid, except the fact that you shaved a person's eyebrows.  Right.  I remember Oscar.  I miss Oscar.  Yeah.  Remember Boop?  Oh.  English.  English Boop?  English Boop.  That was the dumbest thing ever.  The tall, skinny guy. 
[03:19:00]  I don't care how dumb it is.  Hey, Boop!  This kid just, we felt like he looked English, so we refused to talk to him unless he spoke  to us in an English accent.  English accent.  And he had to go, hello!  Hello!  Hello!  This is why life is an O.N.A. intern is hell.  There we go.  Hello!  Boop!  This is why life is an O.N.A. intern is just the worst thing ever.  Why?  Because all any of the interns want to do is get attention and be remembered.  And Bobby's like, he did jokes about it, but he would love to be the one that you remember. 
[03:19:30]  Right.  Yeah.  And British Bob did absolutely nothing remarkable.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Not one thing.  Except he walked in one day, and he had rosy cheeks and blonde hair, and you thought he looked  British.  He looked like one of the kids that should have been on the wall video.  Wow.  And I remember Jackie.  Saw her recently in Rochester.  Well, of course.  But...  Which one was Jackie?  Jackie.  But, Sydney is starting to fade away from my memory a little bit. 
[03:20:00]  Really?  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I follow her on Twitter, so I see her every so often.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You're not even close to forgetting them?  No.  No.  No.  They were just here yesterday, if you ask me.  I remember.  How about this?  The other...  Do you remember any other girl interns?  Oh, my God.  No.  Francine.  No.  You don't remember any of them?  I swear to you.  What if I give you a keyword?  Go ahead.  Cotton balls.  Oh, sort of.  Jill.  There you go.  Wow, that's good.  Way to go. 
[03:20:30]  You wouldn't have gotten that one.  I wouldn't have gotten that one.  I wouldn't have gotten that one.  Help.  Jill.  Yeah.  I remember that.  And then, of course...  Which is actually a terrible bummer of a news for the female intern that we had three  weeks ago.  Last...  Right, right.  Last semester.  I remember her.  Julia.  Well, that kid drove me nuts.  That fucking guy.  I listened to his saga on YouTube the other day, just at home.  I can't help but, like, every so often pop that up.  Yeah. 
[03:21:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You guys are so funny because you were obviously trying to protect yourselves and you'd ask  him all these leading questions and then you'd go, I don't know if he's gay.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know.  That's the whole thing is I don't know.  Can't tell.  I don't know.  His richness bothered me a lot.  Yeah, that came through actually a lot.  A lot.  Yeah.  I had to work for every fucking cent in my life and this kid's walking in with better 
[03:21:30]  shit than us.  And it was when you were more angry as a person too.  Right.  You'd come in and talk about how expensive his clothes were.  Right.  And then just say, my dad just buys them for me.  He just gives me the credit card.  Right.  Just gives him the credit card.  And those kids always drove me nuts growing up.  Because I was in a weird situation.  I was in a pretty decent town, but our family didn't have the money.  Right.  We were almost, we were solid middle class with a taste of upper out there in Centerport  slash Green Lawn. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, this guy.  A little taste of upper.  And those kids got everything handed to them.  Everything handed to them all the fucking time.  The fuck?  Wow.  Hey.  Look, he feels like he'd come in.  Oh, there he is.  Why is Bobby Slayton here?  I don't know.  He's probably doing other shows.  Oh.  He doesn't even give us that.  He didn't want to come on today, huh?  Well, last time he came on, Bobo kind of gave him the business.  That was great.  The business.  That was great.  Alright.  The pregnant chick. 
[03:22:30]  She's looking great.  Nicole looks awesome pregnant.  She does.  She is walking pregnant though, huh?  From behind, you couldn't tell she was pregnant whatsoever.  She's got about another month left before she disappears for a little while.  Yeah.  Good for her.  Has been deep dick in her asshole now?  Jesus.  I don't know, actually.  Maybe we'll get into that.  I've got to ask her about that.  As a personal favor to me, ask her if her husband's deep dick in her asshole.  Verbatim?  Because I heard the vaginal sex was kind of put on hold.  Off the table. 
[03:23:00]  Off the table during her pregnancy.  But I'm just wondering.  A little deep dick in the ass.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'll find that out for you.  Yeah, thank you.  But we can't confirm yes or no.  Who are these chicks walking by?  Oh.  These chicks.  Those are the hits one interns.  Hits one interns?  Mm-hmm.  And we get Bobby the champ?  Yeah.  The fuck?  And the guy we have now, if you remember, he lives in Jersey right across the bridge.  Apparently right across the bridge.  Yeah.  So.  And the George Washington Bridge was in the news like that day. 
[03:23:30]  Yep.  That was very telling.  Sure brought him in for the segment.  Oh.  Where's that?  Look at these chicks.  Yep.  That's what Hits one ends up with.  Hits one gets that, huh?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We're gonna what?  Yeah, we're gonna bail.  I'm bailing on this show.  Fuck this.  I'm bailing.  Bail.  There's no one there.  I'm gonna bail on this show.  Sal.  Sal looks like a deer.  That's a deer in a headlight look.  He's like, what? 
[03:24:00]  What happened?  What happened?  Exactly.  Exactly, Sal.  What happened?  Let me ask you.  I came in.  Travis got off the board.  He's saying it's his fault.  I don't even know what's going on.  Cause you just popped up.  You popped up on our camera like, oh, what?  What?  What?  What?  Why are you laughing?  It was the non-verbal cue to end the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then there's nobody there.  Right.  And then almost like he just comes up from the ground.  Sal with these wide eyes.  Yeah, Sal.  Just pops up and goes, what happened?  What happened?  He's like, what happened? 
[03:24:30]  Not ready to end the show yet, huh?  What happened?  Imagine that happening.  Admission control.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Three, two, one.  Ignition sequence.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Well, Sal comes in and takes over for me at like 10.30, 10.35.  Cause I have to load the first segment of the replay.  So there's a moment of vulnerability.  What happened?  And you guys hit it right on the moment.  Oh, we nailed it.  During the big switchover.  Yeah.  There's no backup system for that, huh?  It's literally one second and you guys just sound really lucky. 
[03:25:00]  Wow.  Alright, we're gonna go home now.  Yeah, we're bailing on the show.  That's right.  Bail.  The Opie and Anthony Show has gone to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments  of today's show.  Sam Roberts' Opie and Anthony Post Show begins in moments. </pre>
