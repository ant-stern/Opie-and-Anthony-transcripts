<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily focusing on the 2008 Super Tuesday presidential primaries and the subsequent Giants Super Bowl victory.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, offered their often vulgar and sarcastic commentary on Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, and Mitt Romney's campaigns, speculating on voter demographics and motivations, particularly focusing on the racial aspect of Obama's candidacy.  This discussion was interwoven with man-on-the-street interviews featuring predominantly black voters expressing strong support for Obama, often citing his race as a factor.  Listener calls, including one from Sheree criticizing Anthony’s focus on race, further fueled this debate.  The show also featured a heavily criticized parody of a Pearl Jam song, "Barack Around the Clock," and repeated mocking of an awkward Larry King interview with Snoop Dogg, including a failed rap attempt.

Other political commentary included discussions of tax policy and job outsourcing, alongside a fictional scenario about a menopausal female president.  Non-political segments included a lengthy, sarcastic dissection of a New York Giants victory song,  a recurring, comedic tribute to obscure Black History Month figures (most notably Michael Winslow), and extensive coverage of Bobby Knight's retirement, interspersed with clips of his infamous angry outbursts.  The show also featured bizarre news stories, like a Daily Mail article about twins dislodging their mother's tumor, and a discussion about a middle school's ban on intentional flatulence.

A significant portion of the broadcast centered on a 22-year-old intern, Adam.  The hosts, along with guest Patrice O'Neal and a female comedian, Shelly, engaged in a highly vulgar and sexually explicit discussion about Adam’s claimed lack of sexual experience and his masturbation habits, with much disbelief expressed by the hosts.  This was followed by the "Car Crash Comedy" segment, featuring numerous aspiring comedians whose performances were punctuated by car crash sound effects whenever a joke failed.  Technical difficulties with the sound effects added to the segment's chaotic and comedic nature, involving studio personnel like Mars and Derick.  Comedians included "Angry Bob" (focused on his weight), Rondell Hartley (discussing a scar and arrest), and Adam himself (commenting on his internship and Heath Ledger’s death).  A freestyle rap battle between "Club Soda Kenny" and "Roland" was also included.  The show also included discussions of Johnny Cakes,  Jim Norton's early TV appearances, a search for a former guest "Tippi Tom," and  various impersonations of celebrities, including Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Rachel Ray, and Michael Jackson.  The broadcast concluded with further off-color jokes and banter, including the announcement of "Last Comic Standing" audition winners.  Throughout the entire broadcast, offensive language and sexually suggestive discussions were prevalent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Girl gives you strip club advice, and then you go and see Little Mermaid the next day.  It's not like I went with a gay guy.  Your girlfriend did, it was you.  This is where entertainment is going.  I think if you were touched inappropriately, you would make it like a quick pop song, like the Beatles used to do. 
[00:01:00]  The love, love, me, don't.  Yeah, right.  Three, six, three.  Tell us what happened.  I had a patient who was a college student and was really, really depressed, and he killed himself.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, we're going to have a lot more energy than we did yesterday. 
[00:01:30]  My God, man.  Oh, boy, did I sleep.  Yeah, sleep good.  I think everyone slept.  It was tough yesterday.  I think we did a fine job, but you've got to stay up late for the Super Bowl, and then you've got to wake up at four in the morning.  We were dragging a little bit yesterday.  A little bit, a little bit.  I got to sleep on Super Bowl Sunday.  I think it was 2, 2.40.  Around there in the morning.  Wow.  So, and then getting up for an hour and some odd minutes later. 
[00:02:00]  That's not sleep.  That's a nap.  Yeah, it was a nap.  Yeah.  So, when I did get home yesterday, it's just out.  I slept for two and a half hours.  I usually take like a 45-minute nap after this morning show.  Two and a half hours.  Got up.  Went to the gym.  Did two sets.  That's for all the workout people out there.  Two lousy sets.  I'm like, oh, forget this.  I'm out of here.  Then I went home, and I try to, I'm trying to get through this rat book.  People laugh because I started reading this book a year ago. 
[00:02:30]  All right, the rat book.  But I've read about five or six books since then, and now, because I have nothing else  I really want to read right now, I went back to the rat book.  That's what I do.  And I'm reading the same page over and over and over again.  I'm like, I can't even do this.  So, then I had oatmeal and went to bed at 8 o'clock last night.  Oatmeal and bed at 8.  Well, the reason for the oatmeal.  You're like a friggin' 80-year-old at home.  Well, the reason for the oatmeal was because, you know, Jimmy was over for the Super Bowl  and a bunch of people, you know, you're eating an S-load of crap. 
[00:03:00]  And I'm not one of these, I mean, we all like to eat healthy, but I'm not crazy.  You know, I don't sacrifice taste.  You know what I'm trying to say?  But Super Bowl Sunday, you just eat everything in sight.  It doesn't matter, right?  You just go for it.  And you just felt, I felt like it was like poison in my system because I don't eat like that.  I don't eat that crazy usually.  Garbage.  So, the oatmeal was to, you know, push everything out, which happened this morning, and boy, 
[00:03:30]  do I feel good.  God.  I mean, two a day, I can't get off the toilet.  Yeah.  Wow.  Whatever was in those cupcakes.  Wow.  Don't call in cleanser.  Yeah, no kidding.  Stupid cupcakes.  I brought the rest of them in here, man.  I didn't want those around.  We got to come in and just talk about movements.  We have to.  It's disgusting.  I get excited about it.  Anyway, so, here we go.  It's Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, how exciting.  All the politicians are out doing their last minute stumping.  Yeah.  Yeah, last minute before the big Super Tuesday.  Where are they today?  New York?  Connecticut?  Where are they?  Who's voting?  I mean, yeah, yeah.  Who gets to vote?  22 states.  22 states.  The big ones, though, like New York.  California is in there.  New York.  California.  The huge state of Rhode Island.  Wow.  I don't even know if Rhode Island's in there.  No clue.  Didn't we do Rhode Island already? 
[00:04:30]  Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday.  It's the opening show.  Yes, here's where you want to come for your Super Tuesday coverage.  That's right.  Yeah, but if you got over-the-top production, it makes us look more important.  Of course.  It's like we almost know what we're doing.  It's a lot of people following the politics this time around.  A lot of people.  I wonder why.  And I hate politics.  I'll be honest with you. 
[00:05:00]  I like to kind of goof on it because we like to goof on everything, but I don't really take  this crap seriously because I truly believe nothing will really change drastically no matter  what's in there.  Maybe not this election.  I really don't.  So I can't be bothered too much, but I'm taking a peek, so I'm informed like the rest  of you guys, you know.  But they're starting to say that there's a bunch of Republicans a little nervous about  John McCain and his temper.  Well, they've always been a little nervous about McCain.  Yeah, yeah.  He apparently has a little bit of a temper. 
[00:05:30]  But, you know, if you were held for a few years by some animals that were just beating  the crap out of you on a daily basis, you might have a little temper, too.  I understand that, but we all do stupid stuff when we get our temper going.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't want the president to do stupid stuff because his temper is going.  That's what I'm getting at.  I hear LBJ had a bad temper.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  Johnson, he used to go off.  So, I don't know. 
[00:06:00]  I don't think a bad temper is that bad of a thing.  Really?  Look at Vietnam.  That was LBJ going, you know what?  That was his bad temper.  Yeah, I'm pissed off, so I'm keeping these guys in there for two decades.  Damn, communists.  I'm keeping them in there for another four or five years or whatever it turned out to  be.  That's why they killed Kennedy, because Kennedy signed something that was going to get our  troops out of that situation.  Yeah, that was true.  So, they had to kill Kennedy and get a guy in there that was for the whole pro-Vietnam  thing.  Everyone knows that. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And a few other observations from just watching CNN and all that, because that's, you know,  you watch CNN and then you feel like you're a pundit.  You feel like you're a talking head all of a sudden.  I noticed.  But my observations are a little different.  I told you this one this morning.  Ted Kennedy?  Yeah.  Looks like an old lesbian now.  He really does.  That huge head of just gray hair.  And the head's giant now.  I don't know what alcohol does to a head, but it has just made it giant. 
[00:07:00]  And he's always had the big head.  But now, I think that trademark Ted Kennedy hair is kind of getting smaller on top of  his head, so it makes his head look even bigger.  Like, he's got a little white tarantula on his head.  He's got, like, shocking white hair.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got very pale, like, pink.  But pale...  Pink pig belly skin. 
[00:07:30]  Pale alcoholic skin on his face.  And he just looks like an aging lesbian.  Yeah.  As he was supporting Barack Obama.  Another observation?  Obama's wife's going to get him in trouble, just like you said.  Yeah.  She's a loose cannon.  I'm starting to pay closer attention to her.  And she's got a little of that attitude.  Oh, they just showed Ted.  Oh, really?  The old lesbian.  Yeah, she's...  He's got to keep her in check until the election's over. 
[00:08:00]  Because it's going to be hard enough for a guy like Barack to get middle American  white voters to vote for him.  He's, as they say, very well-spoken, very educated.  But the wife comes out, and she starts preaching.  Oh, it scares people away.  Oh, it's a little scary.  Yeah, she's got to kind of, like, calm down a little bit.  Yeah.  Just a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  Ease up.  And Bill, Bill Clinton, was making the rounds in New York. 
[00:08:30]  Stumping for Hillary, of course.  Just going around New York saying how they want to thank New York, and, you know, it's  their home now, and to please vote for Hillary.  And then he tried to tie in the Giants' win.  Let's make it two big victories.  Well, Barack did the same thing.  Yeah, he really did.  He tried to tie in the Giants' victory.  Shut up.  I was just reading that.  Barack kind of did the same thing. 
[00:09:00]  Did he?  And he was in the Meadowlands where the Giants came.  Of course.  He kind of did exactly the same thing.  His stupid tie-in.  Yeah, very predictable.  But they're saying that the fact that we're having a Super Bowl parade in New York City  today could hurt Barack.  Could hurt the turnout for Barack.  Oh, yeah?  That's what I read.  Hmm.  That's what I read.  Why?  Cut that for a second.  Why?  I don't know, because I only read the first paragraph.  Pretty explanatory.  Yeah.  You know?  I'll be going to vote for Hillary. 
[00:09:30]  And I'm starting to think Mitt Romney might make a little surge here.  I don't.  He's gaining some momentum.  I don't see Mitt really doing anything.  It's definitely going to be McCain, you think?  Yeah, I think at this point, especially when you look at the Democrats having two candidates  that are pretty much, one of them's going to be it.  They're sure of that.  I think the Republicans want to get ahead of that curve and get behind their guy.  You know?  Get a guy. 
[00:10:00]  Get behind him.  Push him.  Not have a bunch of infighting in the party.  So I think they'll just go with him.  Yeah.  And I really think he'll do okay.  especially amongst Republicans, because I don't think there's a Democratic choice that Republicans  are going to go, you know, I really have to just vote Democrat.  Not this time around.  It's a little shaky.  So, you know, I think he's instantly got the huge majority of the Republican vote. 
[00:10:30]  And there are a lot of disenfranchised Republicans that would love to see a nice candidate that  they could vote for that's Democrat, maybe a moderate, somebody that isn't as crazy as  Bush has been over the past couple of terms he's been in there.  But I don't see them turning around and going, yeah, Barack, that's who I'm voting for.  Hillary, that's my gal.  They've hated this woman since Bill took office. 
[00:11:00]  Republicans have hated Hillary Clinton.  I can't see him turning around now.  So I think McCain's got, you know, all the Republicans wrapped up.  Democrats, I think you're going to see a lot of Democrats that are scared middle America  that might vote Republican just for the sake they don't want a black president.  They don't want a woman president.  That doesn't mean that I also don't think a lot of Democrats are going to come on board  new voters.  I think the black vote's going to be huge this time around. 
[00:11:30]  It's usually hard to get black people out and voting.  And I think with Barack in there, that'll happen.  I think you're going to see a lot more women coming out voting.  A lot of the youth.  A lot of the youth.  A lot of the youth.  There's a youth movement going on with this Barack Obama.  Yeah, I like when he preaches to 16-year-olds from MTV.  They can't vote, stupid.  18-year-olds.  It's like that.  I don't know.  But you really think he was talking to 16-year-olds?  I think he was talking.  Come on.  You're talking to an MTV audience. 
[00:12:00]  It's like 15, 12-year-olds you're getting in there.  Yeah.  I'm going to vote for Obama.  Oh, yeah.  Shut up.  Well.  And stay off on my call of duty with your stupid voices.  Well, you know who endorsed Obama was De Niro.  Yeah.  Did he?  How did he say it?  Want to throw my support behind Obama?  The breathing is the very...  It's time for a change. 
[00:12:30]  He's a good fella.  Bob, could you show a little more excitement, please?  A little more excitement on that?  Not selling cars here.  Yeah.  He's a good fella.  Well, everyone is endorsing Obama, but where's the Hillary endorsements?  I think the Daily News here in New York endorsed Hillary.  Wow.  Yeah.  What about the celebrities and the...  I don't know.  Is there anybody... 
[00:13:00]  Other people coming out?  She's got the former president, her husband, obviously, and the Daily News.  I think that's about it.  Oprah's on the other side.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's on the other side.  I heard Oprah before.  A quick clip of her on the news.  Sounding more stereotypically black than I've ever heard her in my life.  Well, let's get that clip.  I got to hear it.  I don't know.  It was so fast.  But she was going off like, whoo!  Right.  Wow, Lord!  Really, really trying to get that image out there. 
[00:13:30]  It was color purple Oprah.  It was.  It was absolutely color purple Oprah is stumping for Obama.  Other, you know, this is our Super Tuesday coverage.  Coverage, yes.  It's just terrific.  I mean, we're going to show that we're not just shock jocks.  This is where you got to stay for all of your Super Tuesday coverage.  Uh, you got a Pearl Jam song called Barack Around the Clock coming in today.  No, we don't.  Yes, we do.  No, we don't.  You want to play it right away?  Don't tell me.  Where is it, by the way?  Did I just lose it? 
[00:14:00]  In the sea of CDs that I got in front of me?  Uh, no.  Do we actually have a recording of this?  Yes, we do.  All right.  All right.  I got to find it now.  There it is.  Okay.  You want to hear this right away?  Uh, yeah.  Let me hear a little of this.  We're doing, of course, Rock Around the Clock, but it's called Barack Around the Clock by Pearl Jam.  I really thought, yeah, I thought Pearl Jam would, uh, you know, endorse McCain.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Here's Barack Around the Clock.  1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock.  Barack Around the Clock.  Ta-da!  See Bowser?  See Bowser?  See Bowser? 
[00:15:00]  Is this a goof?  Do we have any, like, info on this song?  Yes, it stinks.  It sucks.  It sucks. 
[00:15:30]  Rock around the rock tonight.  On the street, nine, ten, eight, eleven, two,  I'll be going strong and slow.  You are going to rock around the rock tonight.  Psst, wrong track in, dumbass.  Really, who is this?  You suck!  Who is this? 
[00:16:00]  Because it's terrible.  Yeah, it's fading out here.  Actually, it is Pearl Jam, but it's Stone.  Stone Gossert.  On vocals.  Oh.  So it's not even Eddie.  Eddie didn't want any part of this.  He knew how bad it was.  Rock around the rock tonight.  It's too fast of a song for Eddie.  Yeah.  He would never get through this.  Rock tonight.  That's good. 
[00:16:30]  The Happy Days song.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  That's it.  I got some info on the song.  Hold on, I just need this.  Goodness gracious!  Yes, of course.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Stop it!  Stone Gossert and members of Pearl Jam spearheaded the recording of a new rendition of an old  school tune, Rock Around the Clock, cleverly changing the lyrical content to Rock Around  Barack.  Cleverly, huh?  Cleverly.  They changed one word.  They changed one word.  That was it, pretty much.  Here's what Stone has to say about the recording. 
[00:17:00]  Hello, everyone.  This is a track I've been thinking about for a while.  Rock Around the Clock was the first mainstream rock and roll hit in 1955, and it had a transforming  effect on American music.  At that time, rock and rhythm and blues music was traditionally only played on black radio.  I am, by no means, an expert on the history of rock and roll, but this was a big deal.  The rhythm of rock music and its energy were so overwhelming that traditional barriers of race  and culture broke down with an enormous crash.  So here's to new energy, rock and the breaking down of cultural barriers. 
[00:17:30]  Barack Around the Clock.  How about I just, I redid a song and I changed a word.  A word, yeah.  It's not that deep, dummy.  You didn't just pen in a God of DeVita, you ass.  Clock and Barack, I got it.  Get the band.  This is a biggie.  And he said he's been thinking about it a long time.  Hmm, should I?  Should I change one word in that song?  You know what it was? 
[00:18:00]  Because he was trying rock about it.  He couldn't think of anything in that song that rhymed with Obama.  Yeah.  And then somebody said, why don't you try Barack?  Barack.  Barack.  Oh, my God.  Blake, everybody.  Clock.  Oh.  Oh.  Yes, we'll do it to rock around the clock.  All right, hold on a second.  Super Tuesday.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  It's the Anthony Show.  All right, for now, we're going to leave Super Tuesday right at that.  We got more.  Actually, on the way, I did a little something. 
[00:18:30]  Anthony's convinced that every single black person out there is going to vote for Barack  Obama, right?  No, majority.  Majority.  Let's go with majority.  100%.  Okay.  I sent one of our guys on the street yesterday to just ask black people who they're going  to vote for.  What hospital is he in?  Did I send flowers?  Is that what you're getting?  I'm sorry.  I thought you were getting at that.  That didn't sound very sincere.  That sincere.  And I honestly don't know what these people are going to, you know, say. 
[00:19:00]  We're going to find out for the first time ourselves because I told...  Who could he?  It's Matt.  We've sent him on the street before.  I go, Matt, talk to a lot of black people.  Find out how old they are, what they do for a living, and then we'll see who they're going  to vote for.  Second question.  Oh, never mind.  It's going to be a surprise for everybody.  Their answers.  We're going to do that after the break, okay?  Also, we got Larry King rapping with Snoop Dogg.  Just playing into our Larry King fit. 
[00:19:30]  Can somebody call me and wake me up?  Because I have to still be sleeping, and I'm having a nightmare.  There's no way in hell Larry King is rapping with Snoop Dogg.  He certainly is.  He certainly is.  He had a little sit-down with Snoop.  A sit-down.  We smoked a blunt and rapped.  I'm stoned to the bejesus belt.  Yeah, exactly.  And he... 
[00:20:00]  What an ass.  This is great.  Could you sprinkle a little garlic into it?  Wash it down with some Welch's grape juice.  And also, Bobby Knight is stepping down as the basketball coach there.  The great basketball coach that he was.  He's stepping down, and he's given...  Talk about a temper.  There's the man.  No kidding.  Yes.  And he's given the job to his son. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, he is?  What do you mean giving?  Doesn't that have to be...  I don't know.  Worked out with people.  It happens a lot.  Especially in, like, sports.  Like, a coach or what have you will just give his job to his son.  I don't really understand that.  You really can't get away with that in a lot of...  A lot of...  What, jobs?  Jobs.  Just, ah, let my son take it.  I know there's a lot of people going, yeah, you can.  I'm giving my business to my son, but I don't know.  Presidency.  Presidency.  All right.  There goes that thought. 
[00:21:00]  You're right.  I was trying to go with something, but you're absolutely right.  I'm a dope.  It's also Black History Month.  We played this one yesterday.  We're going to give it another play.  And then later on this morning, we've got a brand new person that we're featuring for  Black History Month.  Okay?  Yeah.  We're doing one a day.  We're challenging the staff to come up with one a day.  And not their usual suspects.  Every February, we learn about Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X.  Peanut Guy.  Peanut Guy.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  And...  Harriet Tubman.  And Harriet Tubman.  Frederick Douglass.  Frederick Douglass.  Earl Douglass.  Earl...  What?  Perhaps, no.  Earl Douglass.  What you want on this wall?  Beep, beep.  By the way, Ronnie said, you know, if we're going to do the blockbuster trade, that Earl  has to come back to us.  Oh.  We'll explain that a little later.  That might be a deal breaker.  He insists, before he would even discuss having a blockbuster trade between the two shows,  that Earl has to be thrown in the trade, no matter what. 
[00:22:00]  That's tough.  That is a rough one right there.  All right.  Black History Month.  So this is the one we played yesterday.  We'll give it another spin.  And then we'll have a brand new one later on this morning.  Okay?  More with Opie and Anthony in just a bit.  But first this.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes,  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the  melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor a courageous, bespectacled woman at the scene of a truck accident. 
[00:22:30]  Well, this is what I think.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  Get UPS certified today.  You might just save a life.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What are people saying about the Opie and Anthony Show? 
[00:23:00]  It's funny.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I've only listened to it a couple times.  I'm just here because my boyfriend's here.  Um, I, oh God, I can't improv for shit.  Um, um, I don't know.  Truth be told, I never wake up early enough to listen to the radio.  They're the big Opie and Anthony fans.  I just had to show them how to get here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning.  How's everybody on this Super Tuesday? 
[00:23:30]  Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday.  Oh, yeah.  Nine Inch Nails.  Trent Reznor's back.  Yeah.  Oh, now I want to hear this song.  Did you read our cover of Hurt?  Hmm?  That's good.  A mopping up, uh, the Super Bowl, uh, coverage that we've had the last week or so.  Uh, here you go.  Here's, here's some bullet points.  Most watched Super Bowl ever.  97.5 million viewers. 
[00:24:00]  Second most watched TV show ever.  You know the first one, right, Ant?  The final episode of MASH.  Yeah.  That is amazing.  Well, the only reason that it's amazing is because we didn't have 80 million channels on our TV when MASH had its final episode.  So, it, uh, the final episode of MASH was watched by 106 million viewers.  That was probably, at that time, almost half the entire country watching it.  Yeah, just watching it, sitting down and watching it live, first of all. 
[00:24:30]  Can you imagine that?  Here's something else.  81% of, uh, the TVs around Boston had the game on.  81%.  That's good.  Wow.  That's great.  And what's, what were the other 19% doing?  At friends' houses, watching the game, probably.  Oh, you think that's what part of it's true?  Like, I watched your house, so, like, my, my TV wasn't on, or Ant watched at someone's house.  Well, this, that seems that, is, is misleading.  I'm thinking of all the TVs that were on, 81% were watching the Super Bowl, so there are,  19% of the TVs were watching something else, I'm thinking. 
[00:25:00]  Maybe.  What are you watching instead of the Super Bowl?  Yeah.  Especially if you're in, you know, Boston or New York.  In one of the cities, right?  Yeah.  I could understand if you're in, uh, Michigan or what have you.  Whatever.  Uh, and then 67% of the TVs in New York were watching the Super Bowl.  Got the parade, uh, today down near City Hall here in New York City.  The Canyon of Heroes.  Right.  As they call it.  A ticker tape parade.  And then, uh, this interesting fact. 
[00:25:30]  Eli Manning was supposed to be on Letterman yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  He was supposed to fly out of, out of Arizona, get into New York, and tape Letterman.  Letterman usually tapes at 4.30.  This was such a big deal for Letterman that they decided they were even going to tape at  7 o'clock.  They were going to wait around for Eli Manning.  Yeah.  Which is amazing.  Well, Eli Manning was not on Letterman last night because he couldn't get out of Arizona.  Couldn't get a flight out.  Now, here's the deal.  He's the reason, the reason everyone went to Arizona.  Yeah.  He is the MVP of the Super Bowl. 
[00:26:00]  He can't get a flight out because of heavy traffic yesterday.  Some schlep is sitting in a plane that went to the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  And he's getting out.  Yeah.  But, uh, Eli couldn't get out.  You think someone would have offered, like, someone for the first class seat?  Yeah.  You and your wife.  Hey, hey.  Five grand for the seats and we'll put you on a flight at midnight.  Can you take tomorrow off?  Yeah.  Here it is.  And you can take us for a game next year.  The hero of the Giants' historic Super Bowl win was stuck at the Phoenix airport all afternoon, 
[00:26:30]  unable to take off because of the volume of air traffic.  Oh, is it the volume of air traffic?  Oh, maybe that's it.  Maybe they would get a seat, but they just couldn't get enough planes in the air.  You got to think that air traffic control, you know, pull a few strings.  Oh, pull a few strings.  Well, the MVP of the Super Bowl is sitting in, you know, he's the 30th plane in waiting to take off.  Maybe we move him up a little bit.  Pass everybody.  Go around.  Maybe you make a little exception for the guy that was the MVP.  Maybe the FAA doesn't really care.  And I'm not a fan of Eli Manning, but, I mean, it seems like that would have been the right thing to do yesterday. 
[00:27:00]  What about the team plane?  I thought they all flew back on a team plane.  Yeah, apparently.  Maybe the team plane was stuck.  Oh.  The entire plane.  I think the rest of the guys, didn't they?  Obviously, there's a lot of Patriot fans in Arizona, I'm thinking.  Wow, that's something.  Yeah, isn't that weird?  I could be able to get the hell out of here.  Do you know who I am?  It just goes to show you, when you're at an airport and you have a problem, you ain't getting it solved. 
[00:27:30]  If he, his face, believe me, everyone knew who he was at that airport.  It's not like he's walking up there and no one knew.  Mm-hmm.  And he couldn't get out of there.  So when you have a problem at the airport and you walk up, you go, excuse me, I really need to get home.  Yeah, just think.  Well, he didn't get out.  Then you're the douche that goes, ah, we all need to get home.  Yeah.  Wait your turn.  We're doing everything we can.  Sit down and we will give you no information until we give you the false information. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  We'll tell you that the delay will last 20 minutes and then we will tell you after 20 minutes the status.  Please stay around the terminal.  Don't go too far.  Mm-hmm.  And it'll be probably eight hours, really, but we'll keep telling you 20 minutes at a clip.  Just unbelievable.  And in other airport news, this is our airport break.  Well, you know.  Love it.  Got it.  Anthony was a little outraged.  What was the airline that is charging $25 for the second bag? 
[00:28:30]  United.  United.  I believe United Airlines is now charging people $25 for a second checked bag.  If you're going with two suitcases, it's going to cost you $25 more to check that.  They just, they can't stop raping you, the airline.  They can't stop.  Yeah, it's going to give them another something like $100 million in revenue.  I don't even get why they have to do this because I understand right after 9-11, the airlines went into just a massive turmoil. 
[00:29:00]  The people weren't flying.  It was a big problem.  Now, people are traveling in record numbers.  They've cut everything back and haven't brought it back.  After 9-11, they had to make cutbacks just to survive.  A lot of airlines went into bankruptcy.  Now, they're back.  They're making money.  They haven't brought back any of these conveniences that they cut after 9-11.  And now, they're cutting even more, charging the people more. 
[00:29:30]  It's less convenient, less comfortable to fly.  But now, $25 more to check your second bag.  Well, there you go.  Unbelievable.  Absolutely.  That's why you've got to travel with somebody.  You don't take two bags, do you, Jim?  You're a one-bag guy.  Yeah, but sometimes you have to because if I have merchandise, occasionally, Kenny or I will have to bring a second bag just to have certain things shipped.  Normally, just my laptop and my one bag.  Well, no one who costs you the money is your girl.  Oh, can they? 
[00:30:00]  The last time I flew, she puts her bag down on the scale.  And I forget exactly, but it was pushing $100.  That'll be $100.  You're like 25 pounds over the limit.  Like, what do you got in this thing?  A dead body joke.  They're the ones costing the money because I don't know what they're packing for.  Yeah, I can pack for a full week in one little bag, not a little, little bag, in a standard suitcase. 
[00:30:30]  I can pack for a week.  Yeah, my girlfriend, you're talking at least two huge suitcases.  And then for the trip back, a lot of times you have to ship stuff back because it doesn't fit in her suitcase.  It's just the way it is.  It's the nature of girls.  They just feel they have to pack.  And it's, you know, I hate to be the whole stereotypical, you know how it is with the girls and their shoes.  Shoes!  I don't get the shoes thing. 
[00:31:00]  There's boots and shoes and I think shoes prove that every woman out there has lesbian tendencies.  Why is that?  Because they're buying shoes for each other.  Is it an impress thing?  To impress?  If you take a poll, most guys don't notice the shoes.  The majority of guys don't notice shoes.  I mean, maybe you'll notice one or two here and there, but the average woman has, what, 100 pairs of shoes?  That's ridiculous, I know. 
[00:31:30]  How many have you noticed, really, on your girls' feet?  Really?  If you think about it.  No, I kind of do notice.  Every single pair?  I'm one of those.  Yeah, I kind of notice.  You've got a little foot fetish.  No, it's not so much that.  It's just part of the whole, you know, outfit.  Now, when Anthony says during sex, he likes to hold the feet and wrap his fingers through the toes.  Sometimes.  You like feet.  You like feet?  Only cute ones.  A little more than I like feet.  Only cute ones.  I don't like talons.  I don't like ones with a lot of...  No, no, don't.  Nope. 
[00:32:00]  Nope.  Mouth doesn't go anywhere near them.  It's just...  I like the look of the whole leg and feet are involved in that.  If you chop the feet off, the leg just looks creepy.  You really need a foot at the end of it.  And it's got to be a cute one.  It can't be one with a lot of ligaments over the toes,  like Paris Hilton, awful, big, giant, flipper feet.  Not good.  Like a size 12 or something.  Yeah, that's...  I'm a big fan of the bionic legs.  You like those... 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The spatula feet?  Oh, yeah.  Big fan of that.  Bouncy spatula foot.  I've never heard it called spatula feet.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  All right, hey, let's move on to the Bobby Knight thing,  because we've got a lot of things going on today.  Bobby Knight stepped down, the famous basketball coach.  He was coaching, what, Texas Tech?  Everyone knows him as the Indiana coach, of course.  But he did six or seven years at Texas Tech,  and most people didn't notice,  although he did very well for that school. 
[00:33:00]  It's because he wasn't choking people  or any of his usual hijinks over there.  I think he's settled down a bit.  Well, he'd pop a blood vessel or an artery at this point  if he kept the temper going.  So we want to look back.  We got some...  We collected our Bobby Knight clips  that we love playing on this radio show.  Here's a famous one.  Let me answer that.  You know, that is an absolute crock of...  You know, you people in the news media,  all of you dwell on some negative piece of...  like that. 
[00:33:30]  And I don't know how Steve feels about it,  but it just...  And you don't have to bleep one single word of this.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.  They don't?  I guess he's working for the FCC now.  He'd be the first one to complain.  Let's say hi to Nick in Syracuse.  Nick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you today?  Hey, Nick.  Oh, I think you're out of your mind on this one.  You know what?  The kind of shoes or sneakers or boots a woman wears 
[00:34:00]  definitely attributes to her butt and her legs.  If she wears, like, boots, her butt always looks nicer.  All guys notice that stuff.  They may not be obsessed with it,  and they may not know what an espadrille is, but...  What I'm trying to say is that, yeah,  I notice feet on a woman and a nice pair of shoes,  but I don't think they're completely doing it for us.  I mean, when your girl is buying, you know,  shoes after shoes after shoes,  there's something else going on there. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, it's a competitive...  They're doing it for themselves.  They're doing it for other women  because it's some kind of status thing  between the females.  I think they also got to have, like,  shoes for every outfit that they have.  Right.  Like, they can't just...  We can throw our...  Whatever pants we're wearing,  we can put on and wear the exact same shoes  we wear every day for an entire year.  It won't matter.  They need different shoes for everything they wear.  So they need hundreds of shoes. 
[00:35:00]  It's like the guy's electronic devices.  That's what it's like.  I guess what I was trying to say, Nick,  I don't think they're buying  a hundred pairs of shoes for us.  I really don't.  I mean, we're noticing,  but they're really doing it.  It's a lot deeper than that.  It's competitive.  Yeah, absolutely.  I know.  I like those big boots.  Oh, is that Paris Hilton's feet?  Yeah.  Look at these talons.  And that ligament that runs up the toes 
[00:35:30]  goes all the way up to the middle of our foot.  Yeah, it makes the toes look like they're...  Big, long.  Safe to say six inches long, each toe.  Platypus feet.  Let's get this picture up on onaradio.com later today.  I'd suck her toes.  It looks like she has big, kind of stinky feet.  Oh, God, no.  You know, it's creepy.  It's such a dirty girl.  See, that's horrid.  No deodorant?  I'd like that.  I like...  Mine bound up like little Chinese women.  Japanese.  When they...  I don't know.  They just wrap them up.  I know they...  I don't know.  They bind them real tight. 
[00:36:00]  And then they come out and they're about three inches long.  Who thinks that...  Why would they do that?  Because they think it's beautiful and feminine, but...  I have no idea.  How feminine are gnarled little tootsies?  Gnarled.  Gnarled.  Curled up like a turnip.  Little block feet.  Block feet.  Lovely.  Sexy.  Well, here's Bobby Knight.  Getting back to him, who stepped down today, or yesterday.  Bobby says, college sports, one step above prostitution.  This is...  Really?  Another classic Bobby Knight clip. 
[00:36:30]  Just remember, when you're at a game and you see grass, it's the opposite side of the  ball.  But if you see hardwood out there, it's the other end of the floor.  Try to help you young guys in this profession you've chosen.  That's one or two steps above prostitution.  Gonna miss him, man.  He's a tell-it-like-it-is kind of guy.  Sure is.  What do you mean about the grass on the floor?  I didn't get that.  I don't know.  He's just going off on something.  Don't argue with him.  Yeah.  He'll punch you.  He'll throw a chair at you, Jim. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Don't question Bobby Knight ever.  Bobby loses it on Local TV Reporter.  If it amazes you, then you don't know anything about basketball.  You're illuminating your relative lack of knowledge of the game with a statement like  that.  Let's just start all this f***ing shit again.  Now, I'm not here to argue the thing with you.  I'm not going to f***ing debate things with you f***ing people from television.  No, you want a f***ing answer from me?  You get the answer.  You don't like the f***ing answer?  Then don't use the f***ing program, okay? 
[00:37:30]  What an angry man.  Just an angry guy.  That transcends just a passion in the sport.  That's somebody that is just miserable in life and has to make everybody around him miserable.  Something happened to him as he was growing up.  Yeah.  Something's going on there.  Too many places spaghetti hitting the wall, I think.  You think?  All right, and I like those big furry boots girls wear.  I've been wearing them for a few years now, but those are cool during the winter. 
[00:38:00]  You know?  They look like animal pelts are hanging on the things.  It's like leather or suede, and then animal pelts, and it goes up like almost to the knee.  Those are cool.  Big fans of the Uggs.  Uggs.  Uggs.  Ugg.  And certain shoes are nice.  I've never been a big fan of the very pointy shoe.  I don't like that.  I like more of a natural-looking shoe. 
[00:38:30]  Open-toed.  Sometimes.  Unless they're squishing them together.  And open-toed shoes.  Stop wearing them once you hit, let me say.  80.  I'm going to go further than I would.  27.  I'll say 35.  35?  Yes.  That's it.  Then the open-toed shoe becomes like maybe you see a corn.  Yeah.  Or some kind of other thing. 
[00:39:00]  You think girls' feet go bad in their 30s?  I'm not saying that.  But it's this squished-together toe thing.  I don't know.  It's just what I've noticed.  Wow.  And I don't like any cracking heels.  You ever see like an ankle, the back of the heel, and they're wearing an open back thing  with just a strap, and it's all white and cracked back there?  Stop it.  Lotion those things or wear sneakers. 
[00:39:30]  Stop it.  All right.  We got more Bobby Knight clips on the way, the famous halftime meltdown that we really  love a little later on.  You want to get into the Larry King thing?  This is a quickie.  We were so busy with the Super Bowl.  This almost passed us by, but Sam grabbed it, and we have it today.  Larry King had an interview with Snoop Dogg.  Because he's getting, you know.  Both of these guys.  He's getting all the pop culture icons.  Why would Snoop even talk to him?  Why would Snoop talk to him? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Well, Snoop lost any cred he's had.  And I use the word cred.  Seriously.  Please.  Well, he's mainstream.  I don't use the term loosely.  That's what I meant.  Yeah.  Cred.  I have no cred saying cred.  Well, this is how it went down.  Larry King and Snoop Dogg doing a little impromptu rap.  You like Sinatra.  I like Sinatra.  I love it.  Can we do Sinatra rap?  Why not? 
[00:40:30]  How do you do that?  Can we do Sinatra rap?  Sinatra rap.  How do you do it?  What do you do?  Oh.  Oh, God.  This is going to be painful.  I want to relate to the youngsters out there.  Yeah.  This will get my demo down.  And ratings will be up.  Instead of being number one, 45 to 74, I want to be number one, 35 to 64.  Let's do some rap.  What a dope.  You like Sinatra.  I like Sinatra.  I do.  I love it.  Can we do Sinatra rap?  Why not?  How do you do it?  What song can we do in rap? 
[00:41:00]  Let's do a star spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  All right.  Now, that's not rap.  But you can make it.  All right.  This is CNN, by the way.  This is.  No, no.  I can't.  This is Larry King.  I'm going to look at Jimmy because he's just embarrassed.  I'm getting embarrassed.  Yes, I know.  For stupid Snoop, too.  Larry King really has no business being on TV anymore, but I guess he has some kind of  contract that's going to go on for a while.  I have to stay here until my deal with Satan is fulfilled. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  This program is seen all over the world.  I think it's the number one show on the space shuttle.  This thing goes everywhere.  And this is this is what he's doing to show the entire world that he's out of touch.  Let's do a star spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  All right.  Now, that's not rap.  But you can make it rap.  Right.  Start spreading.  Then start spreading the news. 
[00:42:00]  I'm leaving today.  Yeah.  Come on.  I want to be a part of it.  Come on.  Holy mother of God.  No, I didn't just hear that.  It goes out a little.  No, hold on.  Hold on.  I got to recover from that.  What was he doing?  You see how uncomfortable spreading the news?  Come on.  Come on.  I'm leaving today.  Come on.  Come on.  Do it.  Do it with me.  For the love of God, help me out here.  Help.  Help.  Out. 
[00:42:30]  That's not even rap.  No.  And even that.  That's just speeding up the song slightly.  That was his impression of rap.  Actually, barely speeding up the vocals.  Just adding a drum track.  That's all.  He sang that the way they sang Show Me the Way to Go Home and Jaws.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just went faster and he's pounding on the table.  Yeah.  Come on.  Help it.  F*** out.  What are you doing, my brother?  You want some gin and juice? 
[00:43:00]  Welch's grape juice.  Start spreading the news.  Come on.  I'm leaving.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  He was all angry.  Come on.  Hurry.  Do it.  We've got to get this in before the commercial.  I want to be a...  But come on, you f***ing f***er.  Help me.  For the love of God, help me.  Edison Cooper's nipping at my heels.  I've got to relate to the youngsters.  Don't be lazy now, you f***ing f***er. 
[00:43:30]  Well, it's Summer Wind, Larry.  Here we go.  Why don't you rap to Summerwind?  Summerwind, blowing in, cross the sea.  Come on, come on.  Come on.  For shizzle, my nizzle.  Oh, I got to hear that now again.  I have to hear that.  And there's more?  Oh, yeah, we'll play it to the end.  We'll try to get to the end.  My stomach hurts.  Yeah, thank God we didn't forget about this.  That's better than us. 
[00:44:00]  I'm going to do that all day.  Oh, what an ass.  Start spreading the news.  Start spreading the news.  Let's go up.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  All right, now that's not rap.  But you can make it.  Neither is this.  Start spreading the news.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  I'm leaving today.  Come on.  I want to be a part of it.  Come on.  New York.  New York. 
[00:44:30]  Come on.  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Come on.  I'm waiting on you.  I'm following your lead.  I'm your background.  It's the Larry Green Show.  But you ain't doing nothing.  You're hanging me out to dry.  Give it to the Jew every time.  You hate the Jews.  I'm kidding.  Oh, wow.  Douche blanks.  I'm leaving today.  I'm leaving today.  What's this happen? 
[00:45:00]  Come on.  Of course he left you out there.  He doesn't want to be part of that crap.  Snoop was actually uncomfortable.  Yes.  And Snoop understands that he has a certain amount of, he has to not do this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This, he'd actually sooner put on a top hat and dance in front of Shirley Temple.  Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey.  Hoody, hoody, hoody, ho.  We got Larry Quinn, Larry Quinn, Larry King questions coming in. 
[00:45:30]  Max from Dallas.  What's up?  So, how important is being black to being a rap star?  So, uh, start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  All right.  Now, that's not rap.  But you can make it rap, right?  Okay.  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  Yeah.  Come on.  I want to be a part of it. 
[00:46:00]  Come on.  New York.  New York.  Come on.  Come on.  What's wrong with you?  Be part of this magic.  Come on.  I'm waiting on you.  Larry, I'm following your lead.  I'm your background.  This is the Larry Quinn show.  You're hanging me out there dry.  Give it to the Jew every time.  Well, I'm going to keep that close.  We're going to have to play that a few more times this morning.  I'm throwing up some gang signs, Snoop.  Here it is.  West side.  West side. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, is that the clip there on TMZ, huh?  Yeah.  They had it.  We'll throw the clip on.  That's better than the news.  Onaradio.com.  I'm going to leave it today.  Come on.  He's getting a little angry.  Well, Snoop wasn't helping.  Oh.  What is he going to do with that?  He had no concept of what rap is or how to turn that.  I wouldn't even know how to turn that into rap.  But Snoop must have just been sitting there going, oh, my God, getting all like hot, like 
[00:47:00]  sweating.  Well, Snoop's answer was stupid.  He should have said, no, you can't.  Like when he said, we can make that rap.  He should have said, no, you can't.  Yeah, yeah, I could do that.  Because who expects this old fossil to start trying to rap to Frank Sinatra?  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Hey, he signed through 2009 at $7 million a year.  Are you kidding me?  That's what you get for your $7 million a year.  $7 million.  Oh, he's the worst.  I'm pulling down some dead presidents, yo. 
[00:47:30]  Come on.  Come on.  I keep banging that table.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  When we get back, it's Super Tuesday.  We've got the Super Tuesday stinger and everything.  Oh, yeah, very important.  We're well prepared today.  We're here for all the info you need on Super Tuesday.  Yeah, we've got this today.  Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday. 
[00:48:00]  What's the beginning of that?  What are we, electing a king?  It's like a fanfare for knights and stuff.  That'll work.  I love Tim's production.  He's just silly.  Super Tuesday.  You take it, Super Tuesday?  I don't know.  I thought it was Monday.  Who do I vote for? 
[00:48:30]  Who are you going to vote for?  You think they're going to vote?  When we get back, we sent Matt from Queens onto the streets of New York.  And for Super Tuesday, I asked him to go out there and just talk to black people and see who they're going to vote for.  Because Anthony's convinced most of the black people are going to vote for Obama. 
[00:49:00]  85%.  So we took a random little poll ourselves.  We got about 10 of these.  And we're going to see who they're going to vote for.  And we're going to play the audio next.  I have no idea.  I didn't want to know the answers.  Obviously, he doesn't know the answers.  I want to know where he was doing this.  You know, Midtown.  Yeah.  Why?  You think that's a little different?  That is a little different.  You're going to get more of a business-oriented person, I think.  Or a tourist coming up from Times Square.  So that means you're thinking that a lot of these black people would vote for somebody else. 
[00:49:30]  I'm just making an excuse.  So if it doesn't go my way, I have an excuse.  I see where you are.  And we also have...  That's better than news.  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  What's the matter with you?  All day.  All day I'm going to be...  Just in a complete panic.  Snoop wasn't helping.  Come on!  Don't be lazy and shiftless!  Help me!  Come on!  All right. 
[00:50:00]  And also, for Black History Month, today's honoree...  What do you want to call the people...  It is an honoree, I would say.  All right.  Today's honoree.  Today we honor...  Yes.  And then we're looking at different black people than...  Oh, not your run-of-the-mill.  No.  Yeah.  Everyone does the same ones every year.  Not us.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie.  Anthony.  Jim Norton.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Danny's a smart bastard. 
[00:50:30]  You figured it out?  Yeah, man.  Two seconds.  Good.  It's Super Tuesday.  Disco with that electronical stuff.  Yeah.  Me and dumb Steve are looking inside.  I'm online trying to help you.  I'm looking at the instruction booklet online.  It's a PDF file.  What was the problem, Jimmy?  Because now we got everyone interested out there.  Steve.  Well, yeah.  We know he's the problem.  I am.  Oh, hi, Steve.  I went back to a small...  I got an additional phone, a small BlackBerry, which has a speaker phone. 
[00:51:00]  It's like a Marshall amp.  And I don't like predictive text.  On the iPhone, it's good.  But on BlackBerry, I really don't like it because I wanted it off.  So I couldn't turn it off.  And then Danny apparently looked at it for 30 seconds and was like, yeah, here's a menu.  Yeah, that text thing, it seemed like a good idea.  But they just don't have it figured out.  What, predictive?  Yeah, I imagine a lot of people throw their phones against the wall after a while.  I like it on the iPhone.  iPhone, it works pretty well 99% of the time.  I could miss letters and stuff, and it pretty much figures out what I'm trying to type. 
[00:51:30]  And if not, it figures out something better than I was going to type anyways.  Hey, wow.  It makes it better.  I look smarter.  It's like, wow, that is really eloquent.  Sure.  Well, we can't get away from Super Tuesday.  No.  Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday.  Super Tuesday.  The Ophian Anthony Show. 
[00:52:00]  That's super.  That's super.  All right.  Hey, a lot of people talking about the Hillary clip today.  I don't think it's that bad, but it's raising eyebrows.  Is it?  Yeah, because she's getting teary-eyed again.  She saw it worked for her the first time.  She was dropping in the polls.  She went out.  She teared up a little on an interview, didn't talk in that robotic voice, and all of a sudden  she got some attention. 
[00:52:30]  Her poll numbers went up.  And I think now she's seeing that as maybe I ought to pepper this into my strategy every  so often tear up, tear up, get the sympathy vote from other women.  And I think that could work for you if you did it once.  Exactly.  Once.  Don't just keep doing it.  Like, I brought this up a few times.  I saw my dad cry once.  It was okay.  It was like, all right, he's showing he's a human being.  Okay or tolerable? 
[00:53:00]  Well, it was okay.  I'll tell you why it was okay.  Because Jesus was getting his ass kicked on the big screen.  Oh, right.  So I gave it to my dad.  I'm like, all right, I understand why you're crying.  This is pretty intense.  But if your dad was crying all the time, then you're like, ugh.  Yes.  This is my father?  My God.  And I think it's the same way as far as someone trying to be the president of the United States.  You give him one.  Yeah.  Give him one.  I think Reagan teared up maybe once in his presidency.  While he was actually doing something with the soldier's family. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  He got emotional a little bit when he was presenting a medal to the family of the dead soldier.  I think he got emotional during the challenger, too.  Oh, did he?  Yes.  Slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.  Yes.  Very.  What a speaker he was.  Well, the great communicator.  When he gave that speech when the challenger blew up.  And it was, I don't care who wrote it, who friggin' went over it 20 times to make sure it was good. 
[00:54:00]  When he friggin' gave that speech, it looked so sincere and like he really meant it.  Oh, he's an actor.  I know.  But you know something?  You just described actors.  That is, I think, more important than anything because it actually looked sincere.  I agree with you because I've been looking for Reagan ever since he went out of office.  Yeah, where is he?  Clinton came close, I guess.  Just as far as like that presence and the personality. 
[00:54:30]  He blew it at the end, though, after the challenger speech because he was like, you know, brush the face of God.  He went, scene.  Scene cut.  Where's Bonzo?  Don't I do this scene with the monkey?  No, you don't.  But if Reagan was crying all the time, you would look at him differently.  Mommy.  Right.  You give him one, but after that, you start looking a little closer going, do we want a crybaby in the White House?  So with that, Hillary tears up after being introduced at the Yale Child Study Center. 
[00:55:00]  Big intro for Hillary, too.  Huge intro coming at you here.  And this is more of a visual because you can tell she's getting a little teary-eyed, but I think you hear it in her voice a little bit, too.  Here's the abiding truth we know.  You have always been a champion for children.  You will always be a champion for children right there in the Oval Office from day one.  Thank you.  You will say what needs to be said.  You will do what needs to be done. 
[00:55:30]  And you will make our beloved America the great nation for children that we have always dreamed it could be.  So welcome home, dear friend.  We are so proud of you.  Well, I said I would not cheer up.  Already we're not exactly on that task.  Oh, okay.  You can more visualize.  Yeah, yeah.  She was like a little misty.  She got a little misty again, so I don't know. 
[00:56:00]  It's going to happen if someone threatens to, you know, bomb the country or something or blow something up.  I promised I wouldn't do this again.  Bomb something.  She's menopausal.  She's going through menopause.  Nobody needs that in the White House.  No.  My mother was a monster when she went through menopause.  Was she?  A monster.  A monster.  Hi.  I love you, Mom.  You should have been aborted.  All right.  I'll be in my room.  A monster.  They're terrifying. 
[00:56:30]  But they can't help it.  It's like a hormonal thing they go through.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what was going to happen with, in your case, Mom, you know, dinner might be cold or  she'd blow off dinner, but you don't want someone as a monster in the White House because  they're PMS.  Yeah.  Well, Mom, dinner's a little cold tonight and it gets dumped on the floor.  Well, here.  Why don't you lick it off the floor, you accident?  Yeah.  Secret Service is spending all that time turning up and down the heat.  Oh, I'm so...  Air conditioning up.  All right.  Yes.  Yes, Mrs. President.  All right.  What are you called now? 
[00:57:00]  A thing just drying up like a prune inside of our...  A kick to the uterus, writes.  How can Hillary cry?  What?  Just a coincidence, the name.  It's a funny name.  Yeah, we don't use real names on this show.  Our listeners don't use real names.  A kick to the uterus, writes.  How can Hillary cry?  Won't moisture make her rust?  Yes.  She's a robot.  Gnack, gnack, gnack.  All right.  There you go.  We sent Matt out to the streets of New York to talk to potential black voters. 
[00:57:30]  Cold hard streets.  This was a little exercise because Anthony's convinced that every black person or a majority  of black people is going to vote for Obama.  Absolutely.  So I said, Matt, get some audio and let's play it.  And we have no idea.  Let's see.  What the answers are here.  Prove me wrong.  We get to meet Fitzgerald as the first potential voter.  Good old Fitzgerald.  My name is Fitzgerald Willison.  Construction.  I'm a carpenter from New York.  All right.  All right. 
[00:58:00]  He's a carpenter from New York.  His name is Fitzgerald.  And he is so voting for Obama.  Yes.  You better get your.  Wait, I got a buzzer.  Either that or he's just going to write in Idi Amin.  All right.  So black carpenter.  Obama, you're saying.  Just like Jesus.  Okay.  Barack Obama.  Can I ask why?  Well, I think he's the one to bring, you know, change in Washington. 
[00:58:30]  He's the one more skipper for doing the changes.  What about him makes him that kind of person?  Oh, for one, you know, his young system is new.  He has new ideas and, you know, can get things done much easier, I think.  He's black, too.  All right.  In case you didn't notice, sir.  Can I say, I was in LAX one time, Los Angeles Airport, and I was told there was a black woman behind the counter.  And Obama was on the cover of a magazine I was buying or whatever.  And we just started talking about him.  She's like, you think he has a shot?  I'm like, I don't know.  I'm starting to like him.  And we talked about all these changes. 
[00:59:00]  And neither one of us would say because he's black, it's different.  And then she finally said, like, I don't know if he's going to win.  I'm like, yeah, who knows?  He's only kind of a senator for a couple of years.  And she goes, yeah, and he's black.  And I'm like, thank you for saying that.  We're both being kind of phony.  Well, it's true.  No one wants to address it.  Jesus.  Yeah, we're all beating around the bush.  I don't even want to use the expression that's usually used for that situation.  It's usually something that's 800 pounds in the room.  But, you know, it'll get it.  And I absolutely mean that. 
[00:59:30]  It's like that thing that's just sitting there that no one really wants to bring up when you're discussing politics, pure politics, with somebody else about Obama.  All right.  The next one is Karen, a black woman.  My name is Karen.  I'm a property manager.  I'm a property manager.  Yes.  Is that what you said?  Black property manager.  All right.  Who is she voting?  Now, let me think, if she would be more apt to vote Republican because of her occupation as a property manager, or that would be taken over by... 
[01:00:00]  No, Obama.  Obama again?  Obama.  The white male conservatives have this thing against Hillary that is so strong, it's almost like...  I think one reporter said that he closed his legs whenever she came around because he felt castrated.  But, so, I think that she's...  I don't think she's polarizing. 
[01:00:30]  I met her.  She came.  I live in the Bronx.  She came.  I loved her.  I think she was great.  So, I'm voting for Obama.  He doesn't have any scandal.  What happened?  Whoa!  That took a turn?  She just drove off the road.  I was ready to go, oh, damn.  I didn't think that she's a woman and might want to vote for Hillary when she was giving that nice little speech about Hillary there.  And then, out of nowhere, Obama.  I think she got a blown tire.  She said all these things.  And then veered off to the left. 
[01:01:00]  And hit the Obama telephone pole.  Wow.  You know what it was?  As she was talking, a black person walked by.  She was probably going to say Hillary.  And then she was really polarizing and she just saw the black guy's eyes turn into Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama.  Obama, Obama.  I loved her.  I think she was great.  So, I'm voting for Obama.  He doesn't have any scandal.  He's fresh.  He's new.  He's like a black Kennedy.  Is he?  A black Kennedy.  A black Kennedy.  Wow.  What was that about? 
[01:01:30]  It just shows you.  I don't even know why the candidates try so hard.  Because in the end, it's just a feeling.  A feeling?  This one is race-based.  Well, but I'm just saying, because we've done these exercises and just the reasons why people vote for someone are just so ridiculous in the end.  Yeah.  This one is so, and a lot of people aren't talking about it.  It's really based on racial lines with this, with Obama.  People are voting for him, especially black people, because he's black.  A lot of people don't know what the hell he stands for. 
[01:02:00]  We have a commercial, we'll probably play it a little later, where he goes off about everything he's going to do.  And I just sit there and go, how?  How?  How?  How are you going to do all this crap?  Come on!  I'm going to send them all back to Europe, those conquering devils.  Yes, those white, evil devils.  She wanted to vote for Hillary, though.  But her blackness stood in the way.  She had nothing but nice things to say about Hillary. 
[01:02:30]  She came up to see her.  She was nice.  Yeah.  And I'm voting for Obama.  Whoa!  All right.  How about...  I think black people should vote for him, because he's black.  Unless he's a lunatic.  I mean, it's like, if you look at the history of the country,  I know it's kind of devil's advocate,  but it's like, if we were in a country where it was kind of reversed,  and the last 40 years things were a lot different,  you'd vote for a white guy, because he's our guy.  Just because it's a white guy.  Let me try to put myself in that situation.  Hold on.  I can't do it. 
[01:03:00]  All right, tomorrow we do white guys.  Just white guys.  White guys.  Not white women.  White guys.  White guys.  And then...  That, I think, the age will come in.  To play.  All right.  A lot.  Older white guys.  Younger white guys.  So, tell Matt...  The fan, tell Matt, white guys,  but they have to say how old they are.  Yeah.  All right?  And then on Thursday, or tomorrow...  Yeah, Thursday we'll do, like, the...  Bitches? 
[01:03:30]  It's the bitches that'll get you.  It's the time for the bitches?  We could do, like, the youth.  Yeah.  The youth of America.  And then the profoundly retarded.  Yeah.  I want to see what their opinion is.  Because they all want to vote for...  They want to vote for a Ferris wheel.  We'll do square heads on Friday.  They're writing in things on the ballot like cookie.  Cotton candy for president.  Cookie.  All right, here's...  Start spreading the news. 
[01:04:00]  All right, if you need it.  Start spreading the news.  Come on.  I'm leaving today.  Yeah.  Come on.  I want to be a part of...  Come on.  Come on.  New York.  Come on.  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Come on, I'm waiting on you.  I'm following your lead.  I'm your background.  It's the Larry Green Show.  But you ain't doing nothing.  You're hanging me out the drive.  If Snoop, at any time in his life, should have shot someone, it should have been right 
[01:04:30]  then and there.  Snoop will never shoot anybody.  Let's get another one in here.  This is Leon.  I'm Leon Stennett.  I'm from Queens, New York.  And I'm an assistant manager for facilities.  That sounds like a bogus job title.  What is that?  Assistant manager for facilities.  What does that mean?  I'm a crack dealer.  I'm an assistant to the assistant manager.  Assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.  Oh, yeah.  They just invented his job title.  I do surgery.  I remove the larynx of the pit bulls guarding the stash so they don't bother the neighbors. 
[01:05:00]  Here we go.  What do you think?  I'm a single successful guy.  Leon is going to vote for Obama.  Oh, my God.  This is so obvious now.  Obama.  Why?  I think you'd get a good change for the country.  The country?  Well, some type of positivity. 
[01:05:30]  I would say that.  I would say.  Positivity.  I mean, I don't really know too much of his history, but I'm not voting for him because  he's black.  Oh.  I'm voting for him because he sounds good to me.  And I like Hillary Clinton, but.  She's white.  I don't know if I'm ready for a woman president.  Not because.  Hey, welcome to the club.  But I know women always deal with emotions.  Look at this.  Look at him.  See?  He's being a little biased.  The Democrats have, like, it was with JFK and then with Clinton. 
[01:06:00]  And then, I mean, they have some duds, but they seem to have, like, more captivating candidates.  Like, the Republicans just seem to cart out the same vibe.  They don't have anybody young or interesting.  Like, if Obama was a Republican, a little more conservative socially and that charismatic,  I would vote for him in a second.  I would vote for him because I want to see a black president also because I think, you  know, he'd be a bit, whatever.  I lost my thought.  Do you want to see a black president?  I do.  At this point in history. 
[01:06:30]  But not some lunatic.  I mean, I don't want to see Sharpton elected.  No, of course not.  But, you know, I think he's a good candidate and I think he's, I just like him.  I don't know why I like him any more than I don't know why I really, I viscerally  hate Hillary.  That gentleman, just speaking, said, no, Jimmy, no, Leon, he admitted he doesn't know much  about Obama.  He just likes the way he speaks is pretty much what he said.  Yeah.  Yet he said he's voting for him and not because he's black. 
[01:07:00]  He made a point of saying not because he's black, which leads me to believe he's voting  for him because he's black and then he was trying to justify it.  And this race based voting, when it works with with black people voting for Barack, nobody  really makes anything of it.  But if white people say I'm not voting for him because he's black, then there's trouble  because that's just race based.  And it's negative.  I don't get that.  Look, and I it's not to be politically correct. 
[01:07:30]  Believe me.  But sometimes you have to look at the context and the context of the history of race relations.  There are times where you got to kind of just look at old footage.  Then how about how about the fact that I'm not even saying, all right, a white guy, he  won't vote for Barack because he's black.  Now, instantly you think this guy's a racist.  He doesn't want to vote for Barack because he's black because he doesn't like black people.  I'm not even saying that.  That's just the image that you instantly get when you say I'm not voting for him because  he's black.  I'm I wouldn't vote for him because he's black because I don't think his best interest 
[01:08:00]  is for the majority of this country.  I think once he gets into office, he's going to be limited to who he takes care of in this  country and where his interests lie, whether it's because it's what he wants to do or what  he's forced to do by his constituency is one thing.  But by saying I don't want to vote for a black president, it's because I don't think 
[01:08:30]  he's looking at the United States as a whole that that has to be represented as a whole.  I think he's going to lean towards his own people.  That's just it's basic human nature.  I also or maybe he's looking at it like the United States right now is not representing  the whole.  Maybe he feels like his like because like as a white guy, I got to be honest.  I mean, I feel very represented like and maybe in that situation you don't feel as  represented and you're like, now I will like like maybe you assume that representing white  people and taking care of the white majority is is is an unsaid like it's it's a guarantee 
[01:09:00]  it's going to happen, of course.  So you want a guy who's going to look out for you as well.  But do you think now take Barack Obama as an example of somebody who grew up, was raised,  schooled in that environment of what you said, presidents and and leaders that take care  of the white people in this country?  Let's say he was able to make something of himself.  I think if there was a little more assimilation to just being an American in this country and 
[01:09:30]  not so fragmented with different ethnic groups that people would be able to represent the  whole of the country regardless of their race.  I agree.  But right now, I think it we have to have a leader that takes care of the majority of  the country because to make the country work.  I'm not even talking about my own best interest.  Look, I'm fine.  I don't care who's in office right now.  I think I'll be OK.  But if the majority of the country is taken care of, the country moves forward. 
[01:10:00]  It moves ahead.  But you can't alienate.  I'm not saying alienate everybody, but you can't have this niche presidency that might  I say might just take care of a few.  Hey, Bush has ignored the way like, first of all, because Obama has like white grandparents.  He's not some like radical guy.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  He's considered the black.  No, no, he is.  But I'm saying he grew up around white people.  And, you know, I mean, he grew up in a situation where he was very, very assimilated racially. 
[01:10:30]  He didn't grow up in some, you know, in some, you know, all black environment.  Now he's out to get the devil, you know, with a bow tie on.  But look at Bush.  He catered to the conservatives like the arch conservatives.  Most people want stem cell research.  Most people are not religious fanatics.  But he catered to them regardless.  He didn't look out for the best interest of the country.  That's why I wouldn't vote for him either.  You know, I don't know.  And if you read Barack's book, he he did at some point in his young life hang out with  bad people, do some bad things. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wish his dad ran the CIA.  I understand that.  I'm not running for president.  Right.  All right.  We can continue after the break.  Well, but first we got to, you know, wrap up our Super Tuesday break.  Super Tuesday.  Oh, no.  Super Tuesday.  I'll be an Andy.  What do I vote for?  What do you get a vote for? 
[01:11:30]  You think they're going to vote?  Super Tuesday.  Hey, I'll be an Anthony.  But you can't hate him because he used us making fun of him in his latest freaking production  piece.  Yes, you can.  You can hate him, though.  Oh, that's very good.  I also gave him an idea because it's also Fat Tuesday.  Not only is it Super Tuesday, it's also Fat Tuesday.  So I said, hey, you got to combine the two.  And he came up with, I believe, this.  Super Fat Tuesday on the Opian Anthony Show. 
[01:12:00]  Well, it's short and sweet.  Super Fat Tuesday.  Oh, did you?  Well, that means you want the long form.  Oh, Jesus.  Do I?  Super Fat Tuesday.  Fat Super Tuesday.  Super Fat Tuesday.  Almost as Wednesday.  Super Tuesday.  Opian Anthony.  Opian Anthony.  The Opian Anthony Show.  I told him to combine Super Tuesday, Fat Tuesday, and let's not forget that I think 
[01:12:30]  tomorrow's Ash Wednesday.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Ash Wednesday.  He's obsessed.  He really is.  Hey, you know what?  Let's go to the FU line and see what the people are bitching about today.  We got this fine FU line that we're trying to bring back to the program.  And you guys are doing a great job by calling the number.  Let's look at the latest calls here.

Thank you and goodbye. 
[01:14:30]  Back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We got more Bobby Knight clips to play for you.  In honor of him stepping down.  Resigning.  Retiring.  Wire armor.  He's packing his little box.  Packing up the box.  Trying to give some advice to the new young guy coming in.  Which is his son. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  He just realized that your career was...  It meant nothing.  Yeah.  In the end.  Yeah.  It all ends the same.  You with your little box of stuff.  About Schmidt.  He leaves a legacy, though.  I guess.  There are a few people in this world that actually, you know, leave a little something.  Tell that to Tom that he left a legacy.  I don't think he's feeling that he left a legacy.  Yeah, exactly.  Poor Tom.  Still running without a boss here, by the way, in New York City. 
[01:15:30]  Poor Tom with his stock options.  He's probably naked right now in cash.  His wife's probably just throwing cash on his naked body.  Going, they're all hundreds, honey.  He's going, I know, I know.  All right.  Before we go back to the audio from the street, we also have the Obama commercial that Anthony  wants to take a look at today.  It is Black History Month.  Yes, it is February.  And what are we doing?  We're doing something a little different than everybody else.  We are paying tribute to black people that don't get the recognition that I think they're 
[01:16:00]  deserved.  Right.  A lot of times, every Black History Month, you hear about the same people.  Harriet Tubman, perhaps.  Is she black?  I don't know.  Underground Railroad, I believe.  Yes, Underground Railroad.  And Frederick Douglass.  Martin Luther King.  And Peanock.  The Peanock guy.  Yeah.  That stole the name of our first president through Carver at the end.  George Washington Carver.  Yeah, Malcolm X.  I don't know.  Magic Johnson. 
[01:16:30]  Really?  Got to beat the AIDS.  Jackie Robinson.  Jackie Robinson.  Sure.  Yeah.  People always forget who the first black in the American League was, which came right  after him.  I used to know this.  I know, but I don't know if I want to share.  Secret.  It's a weird name.  Larry Doby.  That's right.  And then there's...  I do know that.  There's lesser-known black people who are very important in history.  Black gentleman was key in the first heart transplant.  Uh-huh. 
[01:17:00]  And the traffic light, I believe.  Did I mention the traffic light?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we got someone we're featuring today.  Okay.  What are we calling them?  Unspoken heroes?  Unsung heroes, perhaps.  Unsung.  Unsung heroes of Black History Month.  All right.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, African-American  individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot. 
[01:17:30]  It is today.  Today, we honor comedian, master of a thousand voices, and star of Police Academy 1 through...  Well, all of them.  Michael Winslow.  He does these impressions.  It sounds just like the real thing.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Michael Winslow is today's, yes, salute, unsung hero. 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  All right.  We'll see who tomorrow is.  I love the fact that Steve gave him approximately four seconds of material time.  The intro is like long-winded, and then Michael Winslow gets four seconds of appreciation.  Oh, it's been 15 minutes.  You know what?  Also, I don't think Barack's camp really thought this out. 
[01:18:30]  You shouldn't have a black guy with a sign in front of him that says change.  We see it every day on the streets.  Oh, my God.  It's just...  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I couldn't resist.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  All right.  That's right. 
[01:19:00]  Whoa.  Okay.  This is the Obama TV spot that just drove nuts this morning.  Yeah.  I'm Barack Obama, and I...  You can cut it right there.  That's where it drove me nuts.  Barack Obama.  And he approves of this message.  Yes.  This message.  I'll be a president who finally makes health care affordable to every single American by  bringing Democrats and Republicans together.  I'll be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and 
[01:19:30]  put a middle-class tax cut into the pockets of working Americans.  And I'll be a president who ends this war in Iraq and finally brings our troops home.  We are one nation, and our time for change has come.  Business as usual.  That's actually refreshing now that I think about it, because it makes me think he's a  lot more like every other goddamn politician.  Whenever a politician gets on and starts yapping about what they're going to do, I just say, 
[01:20:00]  okay, how?  Don't give me a laundry list of things.  Give me one thing and tell me how you're going to do it.  How is he pulling the troops out of Iraq?  Hmm?  Just pulling them out?  How is he getting health care for every person in the country?  And a middle-class tax cut?  And none of this can be done that easily.  By uniting Congress?  That's how he's going to do it?  How is that going?  Where is the money coming from? 
[01:20:30]  How, how, how?  I'll tell you where it's coming from.  Open up your pocketbooks, people.  Open up your pocketbooks.  It's tax and spend Democrats.  Oh, I hate that.  Republicans haven't exactly been great for the taxes either.  I'm still paying them.  You're paying, believe me, you pay a lot more.  You actually got a little bit of a break, I believe, under the Bush plan.  Oh, boy.  What was the break of, what, $15?  No, actually, it was a pretty good tax break. 
[01:21:00]  It's an incentive for people because the Republicans are of the mindset that people in the upper income brackets,  especially ones that own businesses, if you give them tax breaks,  they are able to build their companies with that extra equity and hire people.  If you tax the crap out of a company, they're going to be laying people off and cutting corners,  and it's proven that that works. 
[01:21:30]  You're right, but when is, like, in theory, but when is big business ever, like, taking tax breaks  and just hired the working man?  They just take it overseas now, which, I'm not saying it's even a bad move.  The unions make it very expensive to get stuff done.  True.  They ship it overseas.  It's like, and then you give them a tax break, so they just have some more cash.  Like, the work is still going overseas regardless.  They're not just going to go, well, there's some extra money laying around.  Let's hire Americans.  Well, they have to hire somebody from this country.  I mean, and to build the company up, to get extra money to expand, let's say. 
[01:22:00]  I know a lot of outsourcing is being done, and a lot of people are pissed about it,  but, you know, whose fault is that?  Again, some of these people are asking for a little much here in this country.  I think they ought to cut back on that, put some laws, enact some laws where they can't  outsource as much as they do.  But I do think if you give big companies tax breaks and let them expand, that it is good 
[01:22:30]  for people that are looking for jobs.  I don't think taxing the crap out of big businesses is the way to go.  I think a lot of businesses can be irresponsible, given these executives' huge pay raises is  ridiculous.  But, you know, I like to think that isn't the rule.  I got no faith in any of them.  Look at, like, with the gas they were after, what happened in New Orleans.  Like, you know, there was a crisis and whatever, and they're making, I think they had very nice 
[01:23:00]  profits last year.  Oh, price gouging, yeah.  And it's still high.  They're just, they're vultures.  Yeah, Exxon's made record income, record profits this year.  They continue to bleed you.  So let's go back to the streets.  We sent Matt from Queens down to the streets of New York just to talk to black guys and  gals and see who they're going to vote for in the upcoming election.  Because Anthony's convinced the majority is going to vote Obama.  And so far, you're right, by the way.  Yeah.  Just from our little dumb thing we did yesterday.  Let's meet Ricardo. 
[01:23:30]  My name's Ricardo.  I'm a full-time student at Fordham University, and I'm from Queens.  All right.  Young Ricardo.  There's a student from Queens.  Incidentally enough.  Hmm.  Let's see.  This is Hillary all the way.  You got that right.  This is so Hillary.  I know it's your, I set this bit up for you, but that's Hillary. 
[01:24:00]  Yep.  I think we got our first Hillary.  Obama.  All right.  I think that the way she has a stance on certain rights.  Yes.  Um, you know, black guys are pretty much, we don't know if Ricardo's gay, but let's be  honest, the voice should be followed with, and, uh, you know, hey, look, black guys are  traditionally just like white guys when it comes to, to gay, gay things.  They don't, you know, I think Hillary would be the vote for that guy.  You can't see the color of someone's face when it's buried in a pillow. 
[01:24:30]  So that's what I like to say.  All right.  Ready?  Here's a Ricardo's answer.  And I'm going to vote for Hillary Clinton.  Why?  Well, uh, basically at my school, they're, they're like, they've been campaigning for  Hillary, like ever since the election started.  And I don't know, I guess it's time we had all female presidents.  An all female president.  Did he say it's about time we have an all female president?  Yeah.  As opposed to what?  I happen to have a tranny. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  When have we had a tranny president?  Uh, yeah, daddy.  That's the first one you got wrong, Ant.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  That was kind of obvious, I'm thinking.  Ricardo, uh, was a little different.  Let's, uh, say hi.  Fell into a different demo.  Sheree's not happy with Anthony.  No.  Sheree, what's up?  Sheree.  Hi, Sheree.  Hi, Sheree.  How are you, Sheree?  Hi.  I'm fine, and I'm a black listener to your program.  And everybody I know, I tell, hey, listen to ONA.  Thank you.  For you, we're on FM.  And I'm sick and tired. 
[01:25:30]  But sometimes I just tune Anthony out.  Because he just goes on and on and on about black.  This, that, that, that.  Come on now.  You don't have to shake everybody.  You don't shake everybody.  If you're talking about crippled people, you always throw a disclaimer in there.  We pick on the weak.  Do we?  We keep talking about black, black, black, black.  Oh, shut up already.  Whoa.  Sheree's telling you, Anthony.  You know, I'm just doing this because an election's coming up where there's a black candidate.  I've been listening to, look, I'm not one of those people who jump on the backboard. 
[01:26:00]  I've been listening to you guys forever.  Don't say that.  Before you came on FM, people may not know what you, let me believe what you're saying, but  it's not true.  Who are you voting for?  Huh?  Who are you voting for, Sheree?  Mama.  Oh.  All right.  Enough said.  Sheree writes, Anthony's making me hate the show.  There's black fans of yours, you know.  Sheree, I would suggest you listen to the two guys that aren't racist.  Hey, wait a minute.  Why do I have to be racist if I'm just debating politics? 
[01:26:30]  That's the beauty of this show.  You can pick your favorite and then you tune out the other guys.  So in your case, you tune out the racists.  Just enjoy the fine, open-mindedness of Jimmy and I and you'll be all right with this show.  Well, you know what, though?  Sheree, Anthony's not a racist, but I'll say one thing that's great what Anthony does  is he just tells the truth, like what he's afraid of.  A lot of white people feel the same way but won't say it.  So it's like, Ant really is just kind of being vocal about a fear that a lot of white people 
[01:27:00]  have.  I'm the voice of the white man.  I will give him kudos for that.  Thank you, Sheree.  As an immigrant, he has opened my eyes to something that I didn't even know existed.  And I'm not being naive or anything like that because some of the stuff you say, now I keep  looking like at the next person in my queue.  So yeah, you've opened my eyes to something.  Thank you, Sheree.  I love that accent, too.  Oh, God, I can't get it.  Isn't that accent great?  I'm jonesing for a trip to the Caribbean right now. 
[01:27:30]  I know.  I want to go to, like, Jamaica now.  I'm like, why are we stuck in New York in the winter?  Sheree, you're reminding me where I want to be right now.  It scares me.  On a floatie.  Come on, guys.  All right, Sheree.  And by the way, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Yes, sweetheart.  Work on the Jamaican accent when you're doing that.  Yeah, man!  I happen to have a very good Jamaican accent.  People have complimented Jimmy.  Of course they have.  Don't tell me what to do. 
[01:28:00]  Me know how to talk in patois, girl.  Okay, okay, Jimmy.  You got it.  You got it.  I say Jamaican thing.  Jimmy Cliff.  Sheree, you got to call back, man.  We like your voice.  All right.  All right.  I'll try to be a little more open-minded.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks, but I know you will not.  She knows me.  Yes.  Anthony has finally agreed to shake Jesse Owens' hand.  Oh, my God.  It's the end of the world. 
[01:28:30]  Do you like our Black History Month thing we're doing?  Yes, I do.  Featured Michael Winslow today.  We featured Michael Winslow today.  I didn't hear it this morning.  I can't wait for Huggy Bear.  When is Huggy Bear going to be featured?  But I do like UPS, and I have spread UPS to just about everybody I know.  I love UPS.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Sheree.  Bye, sweetie.  You call back.  I like her.  Sheree from Pennsylvania.  She's feisty.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's meet Sabrina.  Hi.  I'm Sabrina from Brooklyn, and I'm a financial associate for Citibank. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, boy.  Black woman.  David Duke.  Citibank.  I'm going to say Hillary.  It has to be Hillary.  I'm going to say Hillary.  Jimmy?  Financial.  Black woman.  I don't know, man.  Anyone who works in finance, to me, it might have a different skew on things or a different 
[01:29:30]  vibe.  I'm going to say Obama.  But I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if she went Republican.  Some Republican.  Yeah.  You think we're going to get a Republican answer on this, Ben?  You might.  I mean, yeah.  This might be, right?  There's a cross-section here.  No.  No, this is Hillary.  Come on, Hillary.  Come on.  Hold on.  Well, you didn't play the whole thing.  It could be someone else.  The clip's a little long, so she might.  Obama.  Leaning towards Obama.  You know, the country needs change, and I think he's bringing forth more change than 
[01:30:00]  what's been going on so far.  Say that again.  Definitely a Hillary fan, but, you know, we need somebody strong.  And not to be sexist, but I think a man's going to do the job, you know, in the best  interests of the country.  This is telling.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Mm-hmm.  Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama.  The women are voting for Obama, too.  Yeah.  You didn't get one Hillary in this batch.  The only person voting for Hillary was the student. 
[01:30:30]  Yes, the student.  The student.  We got one more.  He didn't want to say his name.  Yes, I do.  He has a very good shot at winning.  Because he's a really, you look at him and you're, oh, the people are just voting for  him because he's a black guy, but he's a really good candidate, and I think he holds  up well in debates.  You know what I mean?  He's not good.  Like, it was like Clinton.  It was hard to nail him down on something he was wrong about.  Like, you know, you got to be good in debates because they nail you on one thing and you're  finished.  Can't he just change his last name? 
[01:31:00]  I don't mind his last name.  I just don't like that mole.  Take that thing off your nose.  That's right.  I brought that to everyone.  I know you did.  Thank you.  I don't like it.  Put a hat on it.  It's a huge mole on your nose.  It looks like you have a little friend on your face.  Like a squirrel.  Boo.  That was for the fans.  Boo.  All right.  We got an anonymous security guard.  I guess he's working for the CIA or something.  I'm from Chicago, and I'm doing security now.  I'm about to be RN. 
[01:31:30]  About to be what?  Voting for Obama.  That's what he's about to be.  Let's be real here.  I'm from Chicago, and I'm doing security now.  I'm about to be RN.  All in?  About to be.  All in.  Playing poker.  All right.  About to be.  I have no idea what he said there.  Maybe the context of it will give more, or maybe he'll say it again.  RN.  Registered.  A nurse?  Registered nurse?  Coming from Danny, who's in the EROC spot. 
[01:32:00]  That's what an RN is, though.  Yeah.  About to be RN.  Sounds like RN.  Could be something else.  Thought about that one, too.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  What?  Nothing.  Plenty of things.  Here we go.  Let's find out what this guy is going to do in the election.  I'm going to vote exactly for Obama, because it sounds good to me.  You know what I mean?  A lot of candidates over there.  I mean, outside.  They do whatever they want.  I mean, they say whatever they want to say. 
[01:32:30]  But this guy is against the war.  And I mean, a lot of people are dying for nothing.  I mean, a lot of soldiers went over there for nothing.  And they're still dying over there.  It doesn't make any sense.  And this guy is all, I mean, he's for everybody.  I mean, it sounds good.  Plus, it sounds credible.  Sounds good.  Thank you.  Wow.  There you go.  It's just an Obama parade out there.  So we did how many today?  One, two, three, four, five, six, or seven. 
[01:33:00]  Seven, I think.  Seven.  And they were mostly Obama.  Six out of seven was Obama.  Figure the percent out.  Six out of seven.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have more of that.  I don't know how to do that.  You carry some number and multiply it by something.  Yeah, it's with a division thing.  As I said, 85%.  And I bet it's just about that.  Let's go to Tiffany.  She's black.  What's up with the black ladies listening to the opening show?  They're black listening to the show, our ebony princesses.  I love this.  Tiffany from Queens.  What's up?  Hi.  I was calling because I've listened to you guys talk about all these black people voting for Obama. 
[01:33:30]  And you swear it's because he's black.  But I'm actually voting for Hillary.  Okay.  Are you?  Why?  Yes, I am.  Because I think my political views fall more in line with hers.  And she's more practical.  You can talk a good game.  But what can you really get done?  And she seems like she's more willing to work with everyone than he is, you know?  I don't know.  Someone who's going to bully everybody.  You think Hillary's more sincere?  I believe she's more.  I don't know if it's more sincere.  I think what I'm looking for is practical. 
[01:34:00]  Practical.  You know?  Yep.  How practical is it?  All of these things Obama wants to do.  You know?  But don't forget, you've got to understand.  And you know this as a woman, that a woman is just kind of not qualified.  You know what?  Wow.  How did I know that was going to be said?  And here it is.  Our impromptu little poll out on the streets amounts to 85.7143% voting for Obama. 
[01:34:30]  And I said 85%.  I think that's close enough.  Tomorrow we're going with white guys.  Just white guys.  Yeah.  I think if you spoke to older black women, they would also go for Hillary.  That's what I think.  Yeah?  Like my mother and all of them, they're all more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah, but don't you think older black people are more likely to go for Obama simply because,  I mean, they remember a lot of the awful things that people under 40 know about but didn't live through? 
[01:35:00]  You know what, though?  My mother, she lived through all that, the whole civil rights thing in the South.  And her thing with Hillary is that she's older.  She also knows about it.  And they love Bill Clinton.  They love him.  And so they're like, all right, she's the next best thing.  All right.  You don't have to scream at me.  I think it makes people comfortable to vote for Hillary Clinton knowing that Bill's going  to be pretty close by just in case.  Just in case, you know?  I agree.  It's kind of like when you're, you know, you're, ah, whatever. 
[01:35:30]  I was going to go with a double count.  You think he's going to advise her?  Yeah.  I think that would happen.  Thanks, Tiffany.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  All right, Tiffany.  And let's go to Denise on Long Island.  Denise, what's up?  Oh, I'm a big fat liar.  My name's Diana.  Okay.  I didn't think Iraq would let me on the air.  So I figured I'd lie so I can get on.  Well, usually we hang up on liars, but we'll give you a pass this time around.  You guys love me.  I was on your show a couple of years ago.  I'm friends with Point Blank. 
[01:36:00]  I was the gymnast who did a headstand on your console.  Ah, yeah.  I remember that.  So what's the deal?  None.  I just wanted to say hi to you guys.  I moved to Georgia a couple of months ago, and I miss you.  I bought X.  Are you kidding me?  Are you effing kidding me?  I don't even say hi to my own family at this point.  Take a personal call from you.  Yeah.  We did a headstand.  We saw your you-know-what.  Great.  Have fun in Georgia.  We threw a headstand for them. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, exactly.  We're sending Sam and Big A to the NBC Knight Rider premiere party at the Playboy Mansion,  and we want you to join them.  Enter to win at onaradio.com.  That's the website where Stephen S. from Bayshore does the fine show rundown.  Yes.  And watch the Knight Rider movie event Sunday, February 17th on NBC.  Okay, we got more Bobby Knight clips.  We got the farting story.  We still have a lot to do here.  Yeah.  So stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi there. 
[01:37:00]  Would you like to be at the front of the line for the last comic standing audition on Thursday,  February 7th at Gotham Comedy Club in New York City?  That's a long question, isn't it, Derek?  Well, come on down and participate in the return of car crash comedy on the Opie and Anthony show.  Give us one or two minutes of your best stand-up, and if you can get through it without getting  free car crashes, you could be a winner.  Email Sam at foundrymusic.com to enter.  Yeah! 
[01:37:30]  A Giants victory song on the way with Opie and Anthony and a little Jim Norton.  You got anything you're promoting, Jimmy?  I actually do.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  What?  I know.  I haven't been promoting lately.  No, you haven't.  I'm at Bananas in Poughkeepsie, New York this Friday, Saturday.  The shows are selling pretty well, so if you want tickets, go to Bananas' website or whatever.  This Friday, Saturday, Poughkeepsie, New York. 
[01:38:00]  It's all new material.  It's not the HBO stuff you saw.  That's very cool.  Well, we got Jen from Hempstead on the Instant Feedback.  She writes, while I appreciate Ant's white honesty, read racism, LOL, he's making it hard  for us black listeners to enjoy the program.  How is that possible?  Why?  Isn't open debate what this is all about?  Can we allow anybody to call up and rebut against what I've said?  That's fine.  This is just open debate.  Can I tell you how cool it is to be the president?  It's probably a pretty sweet gig. 
[01:38:30]  There's a quick little paragraph here called Bush Calls After Blue's Big Wind.  And John Marrow woke up yesterday more into the sound of his cell phone ringing.  He was half asleep and he saw the call that was unavailable, so he didn't answer.  A few minutes later, his wife's phone rang, but she couldn't find it.  Then a few minutes later, his phone rang again, and they finally picked up, will you hold a  second for the president?  So Bush called him.  I just think it's funny that he just wanted to call the owner of the Giants, so he had 
[01:39:00]  his cell, his broad cell.  Yeah, how did he get the numbers?  Don't ask.  Don't ask.  How?  His number is wife's number.  He'll get anyone's number he needs.  Yeah.  Nice to get to call people.  That's funny, though, too.  Unavailable.  Yeah.  I ain't picking this up.  What else is he going to do?  He's such a lame duck.  He's probably the biggest lame duck in the history of the president.  So he won that game.  It was pretty exciting.  You know, I used to own a sports team, Chip.  All right.  I'm sleeping. 
[01:39:30]  You think he just has a list of people he's calling every day now?  Just bored.  Just calling.  How you doing?  Gotta call Larry King.  Tell him that rap was good.  That rap was pretty good.  You know, we should work on that.  Thinking of building a studio when I get out of office.  Larry King.  Raped with Snoop Dogg.  Just in case you're just tuning in.  We did a whole thing earlier on the show, but here's the meat of the rap that he did  with Snoop Dogg.  It's embarrassing.  Start spreading the news. 
[01:40:00]  I'm leaving today.  Yeah.  Come on.  I want to be a part of it.  Come on.  New York.  New York.  Yeah, we get him.  Come on.  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Come on.  I'm waiting on you.  Larry, I'm following your lead.  I'm your background.  But you ain't doing nothing.  You're hanging me out to dry.  Oh.  Snoop should have gave him a noogie or something.  Larry, stop.  Just tell him, look, stop.  Or just pull his suspenders and let him go. 
[01:40:30]  Just do something.  Embarrassing yourself and me.  Well, we're always about going to the next level with things.  And Tim ran in here.  He took the Larry King Snoop Dogg rap and he enhanced it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Start spreading the news. 
[01:41:00]  I'm leaving today.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  I want to be a part of it.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah.  New York, New York.  Come on.  Come on.  New York, New York.  Yeah.  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  New York, New York.  Come on. 
[01:41:30]  Come on.  Come on.  Open your hand to me.  That's pretty cool.  Yes.  Come on.  Come on.  You're going to be saying that all day.  Come on.  Come on.  Got to get a little moaning girls behind that.  Come on.  Come on.  All right.  The victory song.  Yeah.  Do you have the song?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, gee.  As I look, I'm just seeing names and why.  I hate the names in the song.  Do you? 
[01:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's cute.  Shut up.  You don't.  Who came up with this song?  Do we know?  Who?  Ryan Parker.  Like I said, who?  Yeah, exactly.  Who is he?  Some guy who likes to write awful sports songs.  Window Licker.  Yeah, but this is getting some play.  This is the official victory song for the New York Giants.  Oh, is it?  Official?  I don't know.  It's going to be a parade today.  Yes, there is.  Yes. 
[01:42:30]  Yes.  Pinching.  Pinching him.  Eli led the Giants to their greatest victory.  With Peyton cheering on every play.  Another Super Bowl.  New York won.  Manning MVP.  Cooper's turn can't be too far away.  That's Kansas City.  Cooper's turn can't be too far away, isn't that?  Cooper is... 
[01:43:00]  His brother.  The other brother.  We learned yesterday.  The guy's got a...  He can't.  He's got a spinal disease.  He's got a spine that's being squished.  Yes.  For Cooper, a wheelchair shouldn't be too far away.  I mean, if you want to be lyrically accurate.  Of course.  Is there another Cooper we're not thinking of?  Why would he go with Cooper?  Cooper is miserable that he can't play football.  He doesn't want to be in a victory song.  Bill Belichick's premature escape.  Because it doesn't say Super Bowl victory. 
[01:43:30]  It says Cooper's turn can't be too far away for an MVP.  So that's a major vertebrae pain.  We learned about the third Manning boy yesterday.  And it turns out he wanted to be a football star too.  But he's got a spine that is just collapsing on us.  I will say, this does pretty much stink.  But lyrically, I will say it's not as bad. 
[01:44:00]  I hate to say this.  It's not as bad as some of them can be.  You can tell the guy is probably a decent songwriter when he's not writing about this.  And this whole hillbilly kind of friggin' music it's to.  It's a little folky.  Bill Belichick's premature escape from the field  Remind to be a Minnesota boss  Good for Belichick leaving the field. 
[01:44:30]  Good for him.  He shook Coughlin's hand.  It's a real moment.  He's a douche.  And he's like, I'm not staying.  There's time left on the clock.  I'm not staying.  This game is officially over.  Time left on the clock.  He's supposed to stay out there with his men.  Taking a knee is not time on the clock.  It is.  They should take that out of freaking football.  I'm glad he did it because he looks like a douche.  They should force you to freaking do the last play.  Taking a knee is just a waste of time. 
[01:45:00]  Now, I agree with Ann on this one.  Well, it is technically exactly what it is.  It's a waste of time.  Yeah, but then just call the game.  Are you going to be taking a knee?  Yes.  Okay, then the game is officially over.  Why actually do it?  They should force the quarterback to take a snap.  Because something might happen.  And not take a knee where he has to actually run a play.  I don't care if you throw the ball 20 feet over the receiver's head.  Has anyone ever in the history of professional football screwed up the taking a knee?  I'm sure.  Where the ball has gotten out.  I'm sure one out of 52,000 taking of the knee. 
[01:45:30]  Of the knee.  There's always one, yes.  I'm sure.  But the odds are ridiculous.  Yeah.  I can see that.  His character's revealed and their legacy is sealed.  Just another team that ended with a loss.  Because the New York Giants are the champions of the world.  The United States.  Making his legs like the catchers by Tyree. 
[01:46:00]  Maybe Belichick escaped.  Because he had to go and hurl.  As the Giants won.  Yes, the Giants won.  Title number three.  Oh, God.  There's one, two, three, four, five, six more verses.  Yes.  This guy got a little carried away with himself.  He's going game by game.  And then they went to...  Then they went to Green Bay where Brett Favre...  I can't...  His credit card didn't take so his incidentals were charged. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  It's the wreck of the New England Patriots.  The team showed up and they're ready to play.  Right.  We get it.  This song's three hours long.  It's in real time.  Yeah.  He wrote a song in real time.  Okay.  He has a whole verse about a time out.  Same amount of time the Giants took to win the Super Bowl.  That's how long this song is.  Oh, my God.  We can't get through six more verses?  No. 
[01:47:00]  And they're long.  The way he sings them.  Each verse is very long.  A lot of guitar work.  That guitar work is very familiar.  There's a song...  Yeah.  ...that's a bit on the older side that had that same little what?  Everything John Denver?  Breakfast at Tiffany's?  I don't know.  Breakfast at Tiffany's for the most part.  I've heard it, I'm sure, a couple times.  No.  The beginning sounded very familiar.  John Denver.  I might go with Indigo Girls, which is...  Really?  That's a bad reference.  The beginning sounded very familiar, but I can't figure it out.  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  Queen.  Yeah, you gotta be cool.  Yep.  Relax.  Crazy little thing called up.  Come on.  Get hip.  Get on a track.  Come on.  Come on.  Friggin' lunatic.  Doddering old fool.  Oh, there you go.  Danny's doing a great job in E-Rock's seat.  Relax. 
[01:48:00]  Little bit, little bit.  Yeah, a little of the guitar.  All right, back to the song.  Wrong.  It wasn't a legendary throw.  It was an amazing, ridiculous catch.  Right?  No, you're saying finished off with a legendary throw.  Reply me in the touchdown.  I'm assuming that's what he means he's ain't finished off.  Yeah, yeah.  The throw into the end zone there, yeah.  That wasn't legendary.  That was blown coverage. 
[01:48:30]  It was pretty much just...  The guy was open by 20 yards.  Ordinary pass, yeah, into the end zone.  Well, he had to rhyme something with Plexico.  And hard to find anything that rhymes with coverage.  All right.  Oh, that's not a good line. 
[01:49:00]  Dolphins can open their champagne.  That's spent the season chilling on some ice.  It's sweeter to the taste.  Cause their undefeated reign will continue in Miami.  Ain't it nice?  We can do the second half of the song after the break.  Oh, God.  It's just...  Oh, my God.  It goes on and on.  Oh, my God.  I don't hate it, though.  I do.  I want to, but... 
[01:49:30]  I hate this.  I hate it, too.  Put it on your iPod, then.  Maybe I will, and maybe I'll hum it.  Why don't you marry it?  Oh, wait.  Here we go.  Aw, Jimmy.  We got a football fan out there.  Brian on Long Island.  Yes, Brian.  Hey, I don't want to be like Anthony and tell everybody, you know, trivia like that, but  it actually did happen.  It was called the Miracle in Meadowlands.  When the Giants were about to run out the clock, they fumbled it, and ex-Jet head coach 
[01:50:00]  Herman Edwards got the ball, returned it for a touchdown, and the Giants lost.  Wow.  Okay.  Cool.  That's why they do go to the kneel down.  So it could actually...  It is a play.  It could happen.  It's considered a play, so...  Interesting.  I think something about the Giants, too.  Eli Manning was getting a lot of really bad, low snaps.  That center has got to go.  A lot of low snaps.  So I can see him screwing it up.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Second half of the song after the break.  Really?  I don't know.  No? 
[01:50:30]  You want to finish it here?  No.  New York Giants are the champions of the world.  Thanks to plenty of life that catches by Tyree.  Maybe Belichick escaped, cause he had to go and hurl.  It's the same verse.  Yes, the Giants won.  Yes, the Giants won.  Oh my God, he uses that three times.  He uses that same verse three times.  He says hurl.  Hurl.  Mike from Sussex.  This guy's a three-quart Charlie. 
[01:51:00]  A three-quart Charlie.  Oh.  This sucks.  Straight and tuck and Newman Eura led the Giants to attack.  With Mitchell Pierce and Butler playing well.  Oh, God.  They made certain that Tom Brady spent more time on his back.  Than he does on a night with Giselle. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, no.  Ah.  The Giants console all their fading superstars.  They can always reminisce what could have been.  While New York will celebrate smoking victory cigars.  And welcome home the champions, ye men.  Yes, here it comes again.  Bill Belichick's going to go hurl.  We understand.  That's three.  They won three. 
[01:52:00]  Yes, they won three.  And they're hurl.  Title nothing.  Cause he had to go and hurl.  Come on, Jimmy.  Turn along, Jimmy.  Right here.  Yes, the Giants won title number three.  Number three.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Three.  I'd rather listen to Rock Around Brock.  Just an awful song.  I endorse Barack Obama because he, too, will be a giant. 
[01:52:30]  For the newbies, Jimmy's working his De Niro impression.  But not movie De Niro.  No.  You've got to understand, it's not De Niro we know from the movies.  It's the real one that tries to give speeches in public and just is an ass.  That's peer over his glasses and reveal that he has no personality whatsoever without a  script De Niro.  When Marty's not around.  Oh, he really is.  He needs Scorsese to just write words for him always. 
[01:53:00]  Where's Marty?  To direct me through this awful script.  Yeah.  Don Rickles made fun of him when they did Casino.  He was just saying how boring De Niro was.  Really?  He said something along the lines of, I sat there and watched a fly die on his face.  By the way, someone is calling me out because I know the Indigo Girls.  Look, man, I was in radio doing stupid music segs for longer than I wanted to. 
[01:53:30]  And closer to I Am Fine or whatever.  Yeah, that's the song that he's ripping off.  And this guy, James, can't believe I know that.  But I do.  What can I tell you?  You're the champion of the world.  Could you give me a little closer I Am to Fine?  Number three.  He's going to hurl.  Is he?  I'll check that nauseous.  We get it.  Indigo Girls, yeah.  That's why he had to leave.  We'll wait a second.  That was terrible.  D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D. 
[01:54:00]  D, D, D, D, D, D?  D.  Oh.  Well, kind of similar.  Very.  Title number three.  All right.  Are this thing?  I don't want to be embarrassed too much.  Called AIDS?  There's just a lot of people out there that have no idea.  No idea that I know that song.  Or what that song's about.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven o'clock.  But rock around the clock tonight!  Put your glass racks on and join me, hon. 
[01:54:30]  We'll have some fun when the clock strikes.  When we're going to rock, around, we'll rock tonight.  We're going to rock, rock, rock till a broad daylight.  We're going to rock, going to rock around, we'll rock tonight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all they did.  They changed one word and they're proud of that today.  That's Pearl Jam with Stone Gossert on vocals.  All right.  And someone had an amazing instant feedback after we played that song earlier today.  that would have got us all fired.  Yes.  Yeah.  We would have had to leave the country.  Oh, yeah.  It was a very funny line, but, you know. 
[01:55:00]  He just reworked the happy days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In a way that I miss would have appreciated.  Very good.  Wow, Jimmy.  Very good.  Come on.  Ah, Sunday, Monday.  F*** days.  Tuesday, Wednesday.  F*** days.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up, jerk.  Getting more affiliates.  What happened?  We can't say that word.  I know.  It's ridiculous.  Ah, it's dumb.  It's not a curse.  The whole thing is dumb. 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  We'll break.  Oof.  Oof.  Right.  A lot of excitement in New York City.  People getting ready for a victory parade.  Yes, they're all there downtown.  Yeah.  Right.  There's what's-his-name from The Sopranos.  He's got 18 and 1 on his forehead.  Oh.  Johnny Cakes there.  Look, Johnny Cakes has 18 and 1 on his forehead for the big parade today, Jimmy. 
[01:56:00]  Look at that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Yeah, he was a big fan.  Remember they had the special on the news about his house and stuff like that?  That guy, he's crazy.  Yeah, what a nut.  He's insane.  He's going to have something.  I got my goal when he gets home.  We shouldn't make fun of the guy.  He's been on our show and he was very nice to us.  He's actually a fan of the radio show.  Yeah, we'll make fun of him.  He can't hear.  He's there now.  Johnny Cakes with his 18 and 1.  That's live.  He's not listening.  We love his acting, but his house should not have that stuff. 
[01:56:30]  He's a kook.  I know.  Right.  Right.  All right.  We did a lot today, but we still have more radio.  Radio.  We're going to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Educational.  To say the least.  You know, it kind of made me laugh.  Can we get another play out of our Black History Month thing for today?  We got that.  Every day in honor of Black History Month, we're featuring somebody out there in the black world. 
[01:57:00]  Yes.  And today's made me really, really laugh.  It's people in black history that don't get the recognition that most people get.  It's terrible.  Can I see the beauty of this one?  And for anyone that didn't hear it, we do this one, but listen to the amount of time  Steve actually gives.  By the funny part.  Gives to the honoree.  Yeah.  The music that fades back in, it's just so obnoxious that it fades in so quickly.  I can't wait to see who we got for tomorrow. 
[01:57:30]  Because he's coming out of left field.  This one blew me away.  I'm like, wow.  You guys are thinking.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes,  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the  melting pot it is today.  Today we honor comedian, master of a thousand voices, and star of Police Academy 1 through,  well, all of them, Michael Winslow.  He does these impressions. 
[01:58:00]  It sounds just like the real thing.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Steve gets this bit.  He's doing a really good job with it, man.  That's really funny.  That's so obnoxious.  We're really an obnoxious radio show.  And Bobby Knight resigning, so we've been looking at his clips of him freaking out. 
[01:58:30]  We got, we saved the last two for, the last two for last.  Oh, boy.  Saved the last two for the best.  We saved the last two for best, so enjoy.  We got Bobby Knight, talks about fat-ass officials.  Here we go.  You know, we got more fat-ass officials in college basketball with pants that are two sizes,  two small for them.  And, I mean, they look like they're almost reformed prostitutes trying to make a comeback  with how tight their pants are. 
[01:59:00]  Like prostitutes.  It's amazing.  You know, you see this big fat-ass guy out there, and you want to say,  what are you wearing 36s for?  God, why don't you get a pair of 42s?  How do you not love him?  He's going to be missed.  He's going to be missed.  That is a good one.  Happy birthday, Crisco.  And, yes, I know you're a girl.  Thank you.  He likes bringing up prostitutes.  Yeah.  His little analogies.  All right.  And then this is the – I think this is the best one right here, right?  The infamous halftime meltdown. 
[01:59:30]  Mm-hmm.  Bobby Knight, everybody.  I just want to point that I'm getting the f*** out of here.  I mean, if you're not going to recover Greg Graham, if you're just going to let him drive  by you, if the rest of you are going to let him catch the ball outside the three-second  lane and drive all the way in here without one guy challenging him, then I'm leaving  and you f***ing guys will run through your cannings.  I'm tired of this f***ing.  I'm sick and f***ing tired of an 8-10 record.  I'm f***ing tired of losing to Purdue.  I'm not here to f*** around this week.  Now, you may be, but I'm not. 
[02:00:00]  Now, I'm going to f***ing guarantee you that if we don't play up there Monday night, you  aren't going to believe the next four f***ing days.  Now, I am not here to get my ass beat on Monday.  Now, you better f***ing understand that right now.  This is absolute f***ing bulls***.  Now, I'll f***ing run your ass right into the ground.  I mean, I'll f***ing run you.  You'll think last night was a f***ing picnic.  I had to sit around for a f***ing year with an 8-10 record in this f***ing lake.  And I mean, you will not put me in that f***ing position again. 
[02:00:30]  Or you will goddamn pay for it like you can't f***ing believe.  Now, you better get your head out of your ass.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Did they win the next game?  I don't know.  I'd like to know, because you know the team must have been like, oh, if we don't win  this, oh, my God.  I would assume yes, because he wasn't arrested for murder.  Yeah.  He would have killed him.  Yeah.  I think I played sports growing up.  I would have just said, here's my jockstrap.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm leaving.  I can't play under these conditions. 
[02:01:00]  I don't need this.  You are a lunatic.  You know what?  We missed the obvious.  We've got to play that, if we could do it over there, with Sarah McLachlan.  I remember you.  I remember you.  Yeah, it's very sweet.  Can we get that done over there?  I can't play both.  All right.  Can we get it done in the office real fast before we get out of here?  They either won the next game, or they lost by 70.  Right.  All right.  Jimmy, middle school issues ban on intentional flatulence.  I have not read the story. 
[02:01:30]  I just saw the headline.  Yeah.  The studio should have the same policy enacted.  It's the, wow, this is a weird way to start.  The Merriam-Webster Dictionary to find definition for flatulence is brief.  Flatus expelled through the anus.  That's flatus.  F-L-A-T-U-S.  Flatus.  And while it's a natural body function, it seems Camden Rockport Middle School 8th grade  boys are taking it to new heights and making a game of seeing who can expel the loudest 
[02:02:00]  and grossest flattest.  This has been going on for years.  That's right.  Right here.  8th grade boys and those that like them.  I'm too, baby.  That was Ope.  And that wasn't in a sound machine, as you will know, in about 10 seconds from right now.  Wow.  Wow.  Still getting my Super Bowl munchies out of me.  They're now penalizing the boys for intentionally farting, giving them detention. 
[02:02:30]  Strange but true.  Thanks to a bunch of 8th grade boys, intentional farting has been banned from the school.  Started out as a funny joke and eventually turned into a game.  This is the first rule at the school that prevents the use of natural body fluids.  The penalty for intentional farting is a detention.  It's embarrassing to be in detention for.  But just how soft are adults getting that they think that this is a punishable offense? 
[02:03:00]  You know, Nick was raising the point about how they want to make men so soft and free.  This is another way.  Like, let boys cut farts in school.  It's amazing.  They find them funny.  It's stress relief.  Yeah.  It's harmless, relatively, you know.  Hilarious.  I would hate to go to school in this day and age.  Just the changes they have made since we've gone to school. 
[02:03:30]  What did he do?  Yeah, this day and age can't do anything.  No.  In other news that we can quickly get in here, twins kick loose deadly tumor from mom's cervix  while still in her womb, saving her life.  Quato.  What is that about?  Wow.  I guess twins kicked a tumor loose.  And saved her life.  And saved her life many mothers cherish the first kicks they feel from their unborn babies. 
[02:04:00]  But unknown to one, it's always in the UK.  This is not true then.  I don't believe anything from that Daily Mail.  The Daily Mail.  Or the Sun.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't stand when I go because I go to Drudge or I'll go to FARC, you know,  and try to pick up some funny news.  What about Breitbart?  Breitbart.  Breitbart.  What about the Breitbart?  Breitbart.  I go to the Breitbart.  And then you'll click on a link.  It's like, wow, that's a pretty interesting sounding story from the title. 
[02:04:30]  And then the Daily Mail will come up.  Yeah.  And you just know those English papers are all, they're like the Weekly World News.  Mm-hmm.  They're just rag papers with bull crap stories in them.  So is this true, you think?  No.  I think no.  But unknown to one U.K. mother, the kicking she felt from the twins growing inside her  actually saved her life.  Michelle, 35, said her twins, Alice and Harriet.  Yuck.  How British.  Cute names. 
[02:05:00]  Now aged 13 months, were a lively pair in the womb.  At the time, however, she had no idea that constant kicking she felt actually dislodged  a tumor that had formed on her cervix.  And this ended up saving her life.  Quato, open your mind.  I'm being called.  Stupid sticky Quato.  You need a visine.  I'm being called out, by the way.  Rob from Cape Cod, you're right.  I never wore a jockstrap while playing basketball.  Oh, okay.  I developed late.  Liggy, liggy. 
[02:05:30]  I didn't need a jockstrap.  Oh, no.  No, they would hand them out and I would be like, what is this going to do?  You had one of the ones that stood out at all times.  It was not enough to make it dangle.  That's cute.  Like a baby thumb.  But in later years, I made up for it, I tell you.  I'll say.  I had a growth spurt.  Hubba hubba.  Shortly after becoming pregnant, Stepney of Cham in southwest London, or Cheam, was taken  to the hospital after suffering what was believed to be a miscarriage. 
[02:06:00]  Soon, doctors realized she was still pregnant but had developed life-threatening cervical  cancer.  Stepney declined to have an abortion, and doctors at the Royal Morris Den Hospital in London  agreed to give her reduced chemotherapy in the hope of stopping the cancer spreading  during her pregnancy.  My way.  So, it was the chemo that saved her life, but the tumor being kicked loose certainly  helped.  Kicked loose.  So.  She gave birth to two soccer players.  Well, you know that they were looking from the inside, and they knew where the goal was. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, that's true.  You heard this.  Kick.  Goal!  Goal!  Goal!  Disgusting.  And then Danny handed in a ton of stuff today.  Any of these worth sneaking in real fast?  The Willie Nelson stuff?  The baby thrown from a moving train?  The animal shelter ad called Racist?  Stepmom has sex with her body. 
[02:07:00]  Man kills stepmom has sex with her body.  Oh.  Which one can we do?  Man kills stepmom has sex with...  Ugh.  All right, hold on a minute, though.  We got something else coming in from Tim.  Tim is having fun with the Larry King audio, just in case you missed it from earlier.  Come on, I'm sorry for writing that news.  Come on!  Yeah, we got to play Larry King.  He's rapping with the Snoop Dogg.  And this is how it sounded.  Is he?  Start spreading the news.  I'm leaving today.  Yeah!  Come on, I want to.  Yeah!  Come on! 
[02:07:30]  New York!  Come on!  New York!  Come on!  I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps.  Come on, wait on you!  Larry, I'm following your lead.  I'm your background.  It's the Larry King show!  But you ain't doing nothing.  You're hanging me out the drive.  Oh, God.  The fact that Larry said you ain't doing nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ain't doing nothing, yo!  No, no.  I knew that, Larry.  Yeah.  What a...  Just a douche.  You're gonna start starring in John Singleton movies? 
[02:08:00]  Boys in the coffin.  Corpses in the hood.  There's so many.  Well, Tim took that audio and he came up with a version of Two Girls, One Cup.  Come on!  Yeah!  No!  Come on!  Yeah!  Come on! 
[02:08:30]  Come on!  Yeah!  You have it to the Jew every time.  Two girls, one Larry.  All right.  Come on!  It was quick.  Just yelling, come on.  Like, it's gonna add to it.  Like, it's gonna help.  Yeah.  If Snoop got in there and started rapping with him.  Let's say Snoop's just going, yeah!  Yeah!  Like, oh, when is this over? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Martin in Syracuse.  Two calls from Syracuse in one day?  What is that about?  What's up, Martin?  What I learned today is you don't have to go to school to be an RN.  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  All right.  We're gonna do Bobby Knight and Sarah McLachlan in honor of Bobby Knight stepping down, retiring,  resigning.  Yes.  Getting fired, quitting.  Very touching.  Oh, by the way, my observation of the day, I like to come up with weird observations. 
[02:09:30]  And Ann said I was pretty good with this one.  So I watched No Country for Old Men.  And I was thinking the killer guy, right?  With the weird Prince Valiant hairdo.  I'm like, the guy looks like someone.  It's driving me nuts.  Who does he look like?  Who does he look like?  So I'm flipping through the paper today, and they got an old picture of the Rolling Stones.  Charlie Watts.  A young Charlie Watts.  Maybe Steve from Bayshore could get a young picture of Charlie Watts, do a little separate 
[02:10:00]  at birth thing, and throw it up on onaradio.com.  But he looks just like Charlie Watts.  Thank you.  That's a creep.  He sure was.  He blew the lock off a door.  He knew how to kick your door in efficiently.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The lock just goes flying.  You're in.  He had this piece of equipment, if you haven't seen it.  It was like an air blower, and it blew the lock right off the door, and he just kicked  it and started shooting.  Yeah.  He didn't play games.  Hey, we can't do the Bobby Knight thing.  It's just that we just can't do it. 
[02:10:30]  It's a glitch.  Yeah, maybe we could do it.  Nothing on our side.  We need, it's whatever.  Tippi Tom, though.  Steve's in contact with Tippi Tom's family.  They're trying to find him.  Turns out Tippi Tom has a son that's 12 or 13 years old.  Tippi Tom's our homeless friend.  Tippi Tom Jr.?  Most people know about Tippi Tom.  He used to own his own business.  Tippi Tom!  Where's Steve?  Steve, we're running out of time.  Run in here.  And I guess...  I gotta go to a parent-teacher conference!  Things are that one. 
[02:11:00]  My son's doing good at school!  So we really gotta get a hold of him.  Is Keith trying to find him?  Yes, and I was waiting for a return email from the guy just to confirm, but yeah, we're  gonna try to set something up with Tippi Tom's family and Tom in studio.  What's the latest email you got from Tippi Tom's family?  Let's see.  This is his younger brother.  We've learned that Tom was born and raised in Tom's River, and Tom left for Reno years  ago. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Tom left for Reno years ago, then came back after his marriage to a Filipino woman.  Failed.  He has a son that's probably about 13 now.  They're just looking to find out what area he's in, because apparently their father has  recently passed, and he's got an older brother that's now sick.  Damn, man.  Gee.  He owned his own company.  He was very health-conscious, which is probably why he survived on the street so long.  He owned his own company?  Yeah.  Used to.  Used to.  Used to.  Why?  I didn't think you were still a CEO.  Oh, sorry. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Look at me.  Used to, Jimmy.  He was late for the stock meeting.  I'm taking the company public!  They're going to be IPR!  IPR!  The CEO will be late.  He's filling his own underpants on the subway.  With blue chips.  No?  Oh, man.  His own company.  Oh, that's sad now.  What kind of company?  Please find out.  Yeah, I'm trying to find out as much as possible.  There's about a week and a half lag in between emails, so I don't think he checks his, I don't 
[02:12:30]  think his brother checks his email.  He told the story on XM.  It was a window washing company, if I remember correctly.  That's according to Andy.  Wow.  Yeah, I do believe that was the company.  Having a squeegee by the tunnel doesn't qualify as having your own business.  That's what he probably told them, because he was squeegeeing.  Yeah.  He told my own company.  I don't know a window washing company!  He didn't tell them that the device he was using to wash windows was one that all men  are born with.  People never wanted to pay him for it.  So we've got to find Tippi Tom. 
[02:13:00]  Can we just bring him in here and then tell him what's going on?  Sure.  All right.  I say we have the phone ready.  I say we get a number, and we tell that guy, when we get him in, we'll call you, because  this way, he just has to talk.  Yeah.  I would like to do that, because if you tell him one thing, he might not even believe  it.  Can we get him on ASAP?  If we can find him tomorrow, it would be good.  Thursday?  Sometime this week?  Okay.  I'll do my very best to get him.  Son of a...  Also, the old school Opie and Anthony bit continues in the coming days.  We're just trying to figure out a day that works where we can get enough people in. 
[02:13:30]  We're going to take a look at Jim Norton's first TV appearance from 1997, I believe,  right?  Or 97.  I'd rather not.  No, I'd rather.  And Kenny's like, you've really got to see it.  The visuals.  Classic.  Visuals.  I look very young.  Do you?  Sweet.  I bet you do.  Sweet boy.  So we're going to take a look at that.  On the show.  And then we'll pop it up on our website.  You know, the website that's named after the show.  We've got an old school Opie and Anthony section right now, so.  Which is creating a bit of interest in some of the older stuff we used to do. 
[02:14:00]  Stuff that has been buried on the website for many, many years.  It's, uh, it's, uh, whatever.  In the forefront.  In the forefront.  Sure, Jim.  All right.  We're over, uh, it's XM now.  We'll see you all again.  And I just got some good news that someone will be making an appearance at my banana  shows.  I won't say any names, Greg.  Jimmy, I don't know, though, if I can make it.  I'm going to try, though.  I'm going to be in the area. 
[02:14:30]  What are they going to do if you don't show up?  Leave?  They won't care.  They'll be there, already.  I don't care, but they'll already pay the tickets.  But yeah, I'm going to be close to the, that gig you're doing this weekend.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, trying to go for a smooth ending.  It's just not happening today, so.  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  Come on, come on.  Start spreading the news.  I'm a-leaving today.  We're a-leaving right now. 
[02:15:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:15:30]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!

[02:16:00]  Woo!  Woo!  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  And we're here at XM Satellite Radio, getting ready to broadcast.  Well, I guess we are broadcasting because we're talking.  So, yes, we are broadcasting live at XM Satellite Radio.  Yes.  And it's hoodie day, by the way.  Yeah.  We'll plan this one for months, I think.  Yeah.  Finally, the day is here.  Other people are calling it Super Tuesday.  We're calling it Hoodie Tuesday.  We got our hoodies up.  Hoodies are up.  It's also because it's cold in here. 
[02:19:00]  It's also because it's cold in here.  Sam, hoodie up.  It's Hoodie Tuesday.  Hoodie Tuesday.  Try to pull it up over that afro.  Look at him.  Oh, my God.  Your hood is all poofy.  Yeah.  It holds your hood up.  Your afro.  Your head's making Jiffy Pop popcorn.  What do you got there, Sam?  Young Sam?  Sam.  We have our contestants for Car Crash Comedy.  Yeah, we're doing Car Crash Comedy.  What?  For Comics Come Home?  Not for...  Oh, boy.  For Last Comic Standing. 
[02:19:30]  Sorry.  Last Comic Standing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this will be a chance to audition for them.  Yeah.  Yes.  It means you don't have to wait in the really long line.  You go to the front of that line.  Yeah.  Right to the front.  We're doing some of the comedians a favor.  Steve, what's the deal?  Dan, what's the deal?  Oh, boy.  I guess Dan was doing a good job, and I should have just continued with Dan.  I'm sorry, Dan.  Dan knows everything.  Yeah.  Hoodie up, by the way.  Hoodie up.  It's Hoodie Tuesday.  My bad.  Yeah.  My bad.  All right.  Hoodie Tuesday.  Hoodie Tuesday. 
[02:20:00]  Yes.  Five of our lucky contestants will end up going to the front of the line for Last Comic Standing  this Thursday.  But we only have five contestants out there.  Yeah.  The odds are good.  They're in their favor.  We have about ten.  Yeah, we have ten official competitors.  One of them is our own intern, Adam.  Adam.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Adam, who's also kind of a...  I was going to call him a star.  Oh, my God.  How stupid am I? 
[02:20:30]  A participant on the Dan and Sam show.  Yes.  He was a participant.  You guys are being mentioned in the blockbuster trade, by the way.  I guess we got to, like, acknowledge that.  Really?  There's going to be a blockbuster trade going down with the Ron DeFez show and our show.  Well, we hope so.  And you two are coming up a lot.  We're primetime players.  Yeah.  But stupid Ronnie threw a monkey wrench into the whole thing.  He said he would only do a blockbuster trade if we get Earl no matter what.  So whatever the trade is, plus Earl. 
[02:21:00]  That's an instant loss for us.  Yeah, absolutely.  We don't want Earl.  No.  Had it with Earl.  But a blockbuster trade is going down.  Well, it would be fun to have Earl on our show for a while.  For a week?  Maybe.  Maybe a week.  How long is the blockbuster trade going to go for?  Could go forever, but I think realistically it'll be about a week or so where we're going  to completely...  Not completely, but we're going to change some guys out.  That's more like trading spouses, that show, where you send your wife over to some other 
[02:21:30]  family, and then you get their wife.  Right.  And each employee would have to write a journal of what they do on a regular day.  Yeah, yeah.  And then obviously our guy or girl, whatever.  Well, we don't have a girl.  Our guy would have to come back.  What is the name of that show?  Wife Swap?  There's two, yeah.  Yeah, it's the same show.  Yeah, it's the same stupid show.  All right, we'll call our version Dummy Swap.  Dummy Swap?  Dummy Swap.  And our dummy would come back and then talk about their experiences over there. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  And, of course, Ron and Fez would talk about their experiences with our dummy, and then  we would do the same.  Right.  But with Earl, oh, I didn't have a deal with Earl for a week.  No.  No.  Completely incompetent from what I hear.  It's just gotten worse.  My hoodie's too big.  I can barely see it.  Is your hoodie too big?  It is drooping in front of your eyes.  What the hell, man?  Pull it back a little.  There you go.  Jesus.  I'm freaking, I'm going blind on Hootie Tuesday. 
[02:22:30]  Hootie.  Hootie.  Hootie Tuesday.  I hate Hootie Tuesday.  Is it Hootie Tuesday?  Oh, no.  I thought it was Hootie Tuesday.  By the way.  He's real quick back there.  Oh, shit.  God.  A fast hand would have been perfect.  Not Hootie Tuesday.  Not Hootie Tuesday.  It's Hootie Tuesday.  Oh, the moment is so gone.  I thought it was Hootie Tuesday, though.  Oh, God.  Why?  Who's on the board? 
[02:23:00]  A dummy that's going to Ron and Fez.  Yeah, Butchie, you're done.  You're already in the blockbuster trade.  If Hootie's song comes on now, I'm going to run in there and just kill everyone in that room.  I swear I'm just going to stab them.  Why is Butch on the board if he doesn't do this stuff?  It's just too late.  But why is he still on the board?  Okay, I've got to kill people now.  I've got to go.  Wow.  Is it Hootie Tuesday? 
[02:23:30]  It sure is.  With a little love.  I thought it was Hootie Tuesday.  All right.  That makes no sense.  All right.  Get that off.  Ziggy, Jersey, what's up?  Guys, I want to say thank you for Paisano's on Mulberry Street.  They do have excellent food, and they also give you a glass of wine with every dinner that you take.  What year is this?  What year is this, really? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, it's 2008.  Joey sold that restaurant.  Hold on a minute.  This is for the people that like lingering and longering.  Joey sold that place well over a year ago.  Oh, shit.  And I'm sure whoever he sold it to, because I think he kept it in-house, some of the guys, they moved up and they bought the place from Joey.  Yeah.  They were all terrific there, so I'm not trashing Paisanos whatsoever.  But Joey is long gone.  He's out of Little Italy. 
[02:24:30]  He's got a joint in where?  Rockville Center.  Rockville Center.  That's amazing.  Called Aqua.  Aqua is amazing.  It's so fucking good, man.  Yeah, but Joey's out of Paisano.  Actually, he also bought a pizza joint.  Did he?  Yeah, close to the Nassau Coliseum.  Guy.  He's an entrepreneur.  What?  They still doing that.  They still give you that glass of wine with dinner, though.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you very much, guys.  All right, bye.  Jimmy, it's Hoodie Tuesday. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, I like that.  Where's your hoodie?  It's too warm in here.  No, it isn't.  I'll put a clit hoodie over my head.  A clit hoodie?  Thanks, and I thought that bomb.  I just did a photo to Coop and Tobin in Poughkeepsie, and they say hello.  They're actually fans of the show.  Yeah, where are they?  Very, very cool.  Oh, they really are.  They were doing Uncle Paul references.  Oh, were they really?  All right.  Creeps.  We love Uncle Paul.  Beautiful.  Send the police over there, then.  Yeah, they were very cool.  Very nice.  We got a bunch of comedians outside on the bleachers.  They're getting ready for Car Crush Comedy, and our own Adam, or Than and Sam's Adam, who 
[02:25:30]  also interns on our show, he's going to be in the competition.  Wow.  Which one is he?  I don't know if I met him.  Adam danced on, what, Dance Dance Fridays with Jill?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Where's Adam?  Bring Adam in for a second.  All right.  He was one of the guys that danced.  I remember this guy.  He was wearing a black shirt with Vince written on it.  What is that about?  The Color of Money.  You're talking to flair, sir.  See, it's radio, and the microphones are important.  It's funny.  Hold on.  It's got to be on, sir. 
[02:26:00]  For them to be on.  And you would have known that if you put headphones on.  Headphones.  Yes.  Ah.  There you go.  What's up, Adam?  Nothing much.  Just the Vince.  Oh, who cares?  It's Color of Money.  Favorite movie.  I'm a big pool player.  That's your favorite movie?  Yeah.  Cool.  And Tom Cruise wore the Vince shirt in that, and people have told you, what, you look like  Tom Cruise?  No.  And that's why you're wearing it?  You want to have sex with Tom Cruise.  No.  I bought the shirt.  You've had sex with Tom Cruise.  You're like Newman's own popcorn. 
[02:26:30]  See, Paul Newman in the movie.  Of course.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Fucking boring myself.  But I bought this shirt before Tom Cruise officially, like, went crazy.  So, you know.  Oh, I thought you were going to say four years in the movie.  So why are you still wearing it, then?  Most people would just throw the shirt out.  Well, I think it...  Is it official that he went crazy?  Some official thing was said, a statement?  He's still languishing in kind of douchebag status.  I don't think he's nuts yet.  He's just kind of a douche.  Totally crazy.  Brittany's crazy. 
[02:27:00]  That's crazy.  He's a douche.  Padded room.  Extremely crazy.  Two more weeks in the nut house.  So you danced on Dance Dance Friday?  I did.  You like that better than The Hustler, by the way?  Color of Money.  Color of Money blows, bro.  It was okay, but Minnesota Fats?  Yeah.  His real name is New York Fats, I think, and he took the name Minnesota Fats after Gleason  did the movie.  Yeah.  Really?  He did many of his own stunt shots in that film, too.  Not all of them.  I think many of them.  Gleason was a great pool player.  Yes, he was.  Was he really?  Yes.  They say Newman and Gleason had a pool match at the end of the shoot, and Gleason just cleaned 
[02:27:30]  the floor with him.  Look how nervous he is.  And Newman just dumped a bunch of pennies.  He's on the pool table.  He's not talking into the mic.  He's slurring his words.  He's stammering.  I love the fact.  I do like this guy, because he took what...  This is something I do.  I'm not even shitting on you.  He took what would be an awful story, even if Paul Newman told me.  And he related, but away from a microphone and uncomfortable.  Tell the story.  Come on.  No, no, no.  You're not sitting down.  As he was getting to the end, you ever get to the end of a story, you realize your story 
[02:28:00]  has no finish?  Yeah.  And then he's fast forwarding, and he knows pennies is the thing, and it's shit.  And he took pennies, and he did, you know, whatever.  I've got to punch this story up.  And take the hands off the console, because you're...  You're swallowing a lot.  No, don't.  The reason you have your hands on the console is because you're very nervous, and you're  trying to keep the nerves...  Yeah.  You don't know what to do with your hands.  Now they're behind your back, like Addy's in the army.  Now tell the same story.  What, about the whole... 
[02:28:30]  Don't put your hands in the pocket.  Oh, look at this.  Be comfortable.  His wrists are twitching.  All right.  Well, there was a $100 wager at the conclusion of the shoot of The Hustler, and Jackie Gleason  and Paul Newman played each other in pool.  And Jackie Gleason...  How many comedians we got for...  Yeah.  Well, uh...  Ignore me.  Ten.  Excuse me?  Sorry.  You're not supposed to acknowledge that I'm ignoring you.  I...  Just deal with it.  Thank you.  Okay.  Let's go and make all the comedians outside comfortable. 
[02:29:00]  Fucking poor bastards.  I don't know how it is.  They have to go do a set, and they're just watching this.  They're like, he knows these guys, and this shit is happening like this.  I know.  For the comedians outside, we hate this guy.  We don't know anything about most of you, so don't worry about it.  We just despise this kid that you're staring at as you sit on the bleachers.  We'll be nice.  Because it's a big deal.  You know, what?  Five of these guys get to the front of the line, right?  Yep.  For last comic standing.  Let me tell you something about last comic standing.  A lot of guys shit on it, but we were off the air.  I was fiercely depressed, and my managers didn't want me to go out for it. 
[02:29:30]  I wound up doing two episodes, but because of a contractual thing, I couldn't go any farther  because I had a contract with Viacom, two MTV pilots.  They were shit.  Both of them were shit.  But it opened the door to The Tonight Show for me, and I've fucking done five Leno's.  That was absolutely a direct result of doing that show because of Bob and Ross.  Wow.  Book it.  And they had contacted me a month later.  And I'm not shilling for last comic standing, but comedians will shit on it.  But you know what?  It fucking opened a major door for me.  And they're like, hey, send a tape.  We'd love to see it for Jay.  We liked what you did on the show. 
[02:30:00]  And I didn't send a tape.  And a month later, they called me again.  They're like, did you put that tape together?  And I'm like, what am I, a fucking dummy?  What am I doing?  Exactly.  So they went for real.  Well, here's Adam on Dance Dance Friday with Jill Nicolini, locally here in New York.  Oh, my God.  I love her fashion.  You guys are good.  Give me one more of those, like, pirouette things.  I'm standing out.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Bring your cousins.  Woo!  Two boys from Michigan.  By the way, Adam, it's going to be a new agent.  I don't see you, Anthony.  Guys, see you in the morning.  Way to go, guys. 
[02:30:30]  Thanks for coming in.  That's a new show, by the way.  And by the way, they've been pushing this audio on us for the last three months.  That's why we didn't play it.  What?  That's a rift.  Clusterfuck.  We can't follow it.  We don't know.  I don't even know what went on in there.  It's such a visual.  Yeah.  You were dancing?  I was dancing, yeah.  So what song?  The Canned Heat by Jamiroquois.  Do we have that song?  Well, the other thing about that audio is it was before it had been determined that he 
[02:31:00]  was going to be an intern here.  And Jill proudly says he's going to be an intern on it.  Oh.  So that's why a couple months ago was a little stronger.  Oh.  Well, he got the job done.  He did.  You want to dance to that song for everybody?  Get them warm.  You know, get these people going.  Let's see what they're actually.  Wow.  Here, put the headphones on.  Move the chair away.  I'd like to see...  You got that song?  All right.  Can I tell you something about comedians?  There's nothing that makes these bastards happier than to see him fucking getting a dick  stuck right in his mouth. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, the comics love it.  Oh, boy, do we.  All right.  Move the mic.  You got enough cord to dance?  This is Adam, the intern, who's going to be part of this car crash comedy thing we're  doing in about 15 minutes.  We're just waiting for Patrice, who's stuck in traffic right now.  But we got Adam.  He's going to dance for the crowd out there.  Do we have a mic on the crowd so we can get their reaction?  Sure.  All right.  We're getting that.  Patrice is stuck.  Yeah, in traffic.  All right.  Here we go.  This is Adam.  This is the song you danced on live TV here in New York City. 
[02:32:00]  And start the music.  I can't look at it.  He's pushing his hips in and out. 
[02:32:30]  What a tool.  Wow.  What an absolute tool.  Car crash dancing, people are saying.  And there he is, just dancing.  He was doing the lawnmower.  Now he's...  See, now he's trying to mock dancing, but we know that he's trying to look cool.  No, I think he's really dancing.  Yes.  He's saying he's being ironic, so it's not as humiliating.  Right, right, right.  He's being moronic.  Yes.  Patrice is stuck in a doorway, someone's saying.  He's like fucking Tor Johnson.  A man his size would have trouble walking through doors. 
[02:33:00]  All right, thank you.  I'm getting another communique.  I guess we learned about Adam today.  I was...  We were avoiding this, but I guess we have to go here.  Adam, you've never kissed a girl for real?  What's that about?  For real?  Did it for fake?  How old are you?  Dead one?  22.  Gay?  No.  No.  No.  Not yet.  You ever just hold a cock?  Willing to learn.  No.  No.  Like, let it slap you in the face a couple times?  You just cup a cock in your hand and look at it and make comments? 
[02:33:30]  Who got you that information?  Huh?  How did you get that information?  Who leaked it?  So it is true.  Did you really never kiss a girl?  I've, uh, you know, I was kind of, uh, you know, kind of an outsider in high school.  Outsider?  Exactly.  Psychopathic.  Who are you, fucking Cho from Virginia Tech?  How fucking...  Thanks, Dan.  Did we get a girl to kiss this guy or what?  Where's Travis?  Ah! 
[02:34:00]  Wow.  So all through high school?  Yeah.  You know, I...  Never...  I was into sports and writing and just doing my own thing.  I would then have to...  Wait, sports and writing, you should have got laid in high school.  That's a good combination.  Girls kind of like a guy that can write a little bit.  I'd then have to make the assumption you're a virgin because you probably would have kissed  the girl if you were having sex with her.  Hey, Patrice, this guy, Adam, he's an intern.  He's never kissed a girl before.  And we think he's a virgin, too.  Well, you're correct.  I've got a kiss to go.  I'm not ashamed of this. 
[02:34:30]  Mr. Patrice, I'm rocking the hoodie today.  It's hoodie day.  It's hoodie day.  I got hot.  I had to take mine off.  I'm feeling good about it.  And I finally saw your HBO...  Collar day.  Your HBO On Demand, finally.  You saw that?  Oh, fuck.  Was that funny, Patrice O'Neal?  Thank you, sir.  Really funny.  Good morning, fellas.  The shirt was obnoxious.  We've been discussing the shirt for the last couple days.  I didn't like it, but the set was hilarious.  I tried.  I'm trying to...  I tried.  I actually liked the hat.  I didn't want to like the hat, but it actually did look good.  I didn't upgrade the suit jacket yet.  I thought he was trashing him today. 
[02:35:00]  No.  Ah, look at Patrice.  What do you want?  I don't care.  No, no, no.  I know we have to have a thousand people.  I want to hear at least...  But I thought we was trashing him today.  We wanted to, but we don't have enough people.  We've heard...  Get us a taste for the preview.  Because when we got bashed beforehand, we played a little taste of it.  Yeah.  What?  It's not here.  Oh, it's not here.  What?  Thank God.  Where is it?  Someone best fetch it.  Hopefully in a toilet where it belongs.  Someone best step and fetch it. 
[02:35:30]  Sam's got it at home?  Yeah.  At home.  Atta boy, Sam.  Sam.  Because Steve told me there wouldn't be until next week.  Is it on your computer at home?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you have...  Sam, go calm your face.  You know, instead of mypc.com, you could punch up your computer at home and just drag  and drop a file.  You know what Sam looks like?  I've got to get that.  He looks like altered states.  Yeah.  Poor Sam.  Sam, something's happening to Sam. 
[02:36:00]  He's transforming into something.  We're missing an opportunity, though.  Let's get back to Adam.  We'll get Jimmy's tape on soon.  Adam.  I keep wanting to call him Vince.  Adam, what kind of...  Stupid shirt.  What kind of sports do you play in high school?  Baseball, basketball, cross country.  So you should have got pussy for that.  You know, I was kind of a...  How old is he?  He's 22.  I don't think he's a virgin.  I think he's a game.  I can smell virgin.  I don't smell virgin in the sky.  Are you serious?  Do you think he's full of Raleigh chicks and he's just trying to be like the interesting  guy?  Yeah.  I think he's...  Look at the kid.  He's strapping. 
[02:36:30]  He's uncomfortable.  The only thing...  The only thing he's got the Knight Rider eye, like the eye that...  Like the Knight Rider in front of the Knight Rider car.  And it just moves.  You can see his right eye has a problem.  He's real nervous.  And he's one of those guys that looks down and looks up.  Yeah.  But other than that, he doesn't...  He's real nervous.  He doesn't seem...  No, he seems like he's very awkward.  I could definitely see him not being able to talk to a girl or get her to the point where  he's, you know, going to make a move.  Look at his hands.  I don't fuck girls.  I awkward dialogue them. 
[02:37:00]  So, you know.  You talk your way out of pussy, but he has big hands and he's like a big kid.  Wait, how do you blow with pussy?  With your rap?  You're not a bad looking dude.  Yeah.  Where does it go wrong for you?  Jimmy will fuck you.  Right in the mouth of that ass.  Excuse my French.  That's the mouth.  I don't really know where it goes wrong.  It's just, you know, I just haven't pursued it.  I haven't really put myself out there.  I just kind of...  I'm kind of a recluse, you know?  Yeah, but you got to be fucking, like, dying for a girl. 
[02:37:30]  How long have you been a recluse?  Wait, wait.  You're kind of like, eh, meh.  It's a take it or leave it thing with girls?  You know, I don't know.  Do you like girls or do you hate them?  I do like girls.  No, I don't mean in a gay way.  I mean, like, hatred.  Like what I have.  Like, you just hate girls.  I don't hate girls.  I like everyone.  Don't you feel like you want to, you know, touch a tit?  Like, touch your pussy, do things like that?  Yeah.  You don't want to do that? 
[02:38:00]  You know what it's like when you first put your dick in a girl?  That feeling.  Exactly.  Do you remember that?  It's amazing.  You remember that feeling?  Yeah.  Wow.  He goes, yeah.  Wow.  Fucking.  Trying to get back to that first time ever since.  It's like heroin.  Pussy is like heroin.  Pussy is like heroin.  I feel nothing.  Look at that first.  Patrice is just like an animal instinct.  Fuck it.  It's just fucking.  I could just as easily be fucking throwing a baseball up and catching it in my own fucking 
[02:38:30]  hands.  Meaningless.  I only fuck so I have a memory to jerk off to later.  Jesus Christ, is that the fucking truth?  God, that's brilliant.  It's not living.  It is absolutely.  I'm videotaping something that I can jerk off to and make mine later.  You are a big player in this filthy movie.  That's exactly what it is.  There isn't a point where you're just like, your dick's kind of on the outside and then  you slowly and then push and that and you're just like, wow, that's fucking good.  Not even close. 
[02:39:00]  Wow.  You guys are jaded on the pussy.  There's no sexual fucking feeling left.  I don't really just look at it going.  I go, boy.  Yep.  Really?  I'll still make that fucking noise.  I feel good until it's in.  I'm like, like as I'm pushing, I'm like, oh my God, I've lost interest.  There is a lot of wah-wah music in my head with my dick.  And the sad thing, I have no, there's no embarrassment anymore.  No.

What's going on with you?  I don't really know what's going on.  Do you jerk off?  Oh, yes.  What do you jerk off to?  Yeah, you got to think about something or look at pictures.  No, what's your jerking off to situation?  You know, anything I can download for free off, like LimeWire. 
[02:40:00]  What do you like?  LimeWire, uh-oh.  What do you like?  LimeWire?  What's that about?  Because I used to be.  You got other people's computers, FileShare.  Oh boy.  JP.  Okay, now we understand.  You know, just like hardcore.  What's your preference?  What girls do you like?  Something in patent leather.  Yeah, a little Susie.  The same thing the fucking colonel from Boogie Nights used to jerk off to.  I don't touch them.  I just, they're so small.  Jack, are you my friend, Jack?  I just look at them. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, what do you jerk off to?  What do you jerk off to, man?  Uh, just, uh, you know, just any and everything.  No, what's your, what's your, you know, everything.  That's a little vague.  Hold on, we can't let that fly by.  Anything and everything.  That, that, that, you know, your body language is saying that you are lying, my friend.  Anything and everything.  What does that mean?  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Well, you know, maybe once, twice.  I don't smell sissy on him at all, though.  I just don't see it.  It's not sissy.  But something's going on. 
[02:41:00]  Um, there's something probably.  Touched as a kid?  No, no.  Are you African?  I wonder where they clip your balls with, like, so you can concentrate on fighting.  You like little plaid skirts and pigtails?  No.  Right?  I, I really, I really can't explain it.  As you should.  That's what I'm saying.  That's right.  But you can't explain it.  Why?  Well, because, you know, it's, uh, I, I just don't know.  It's just never.  You don't know what your preference is to jerking off?  Like, is it.  Well, is it. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  What was the last thing you jerked off to?  That's an easy question.  And not everything and anything.  Oh, Kenny had one.  What?  Kenny.  Kenny.  Himself in the mirror.  I didn't say it was a good one.  God damn.  I said Kenny had one.  What's your preference, dude?  What do you like?  When you, wait a minute, when you see a woman, like, if I see a, a, a little five foot, one  inch, like 160 pound animal, it just does something for me.  A little round butt.  Like 160 pounds.  I just like short, round girls.

Well, you're a Jehovah Witness or something fucked up like that?  And you, and you, and you stop and your parents don't fuck with you?  You know, you know, getting, uh, I don't know.  What do you jerk off to her showing up to work on time?  It's fucking idiotic.  No, I, I, I don't know.  It's just like, uh, a lot of guys are like, oh man, I gotta get pussy or I'm gonna like  kill myself.  He's fucking, something happened to him.  I'm not, I'm not really like that.  You know?  You scared? 
[02:43:00]  That's a good, you don't scare.  You know that's against God, right?  How big, how big is my dick?  Yeah.  It's, uh.  Are you average?  I average, like six, seven.  All right, you're not tiny.  You're packing a seven?  I, I measured it with my remote control.  And your, your, your dick is about as big as a remote?  No.  I was, I wanted to measure it, but I didn't have a ruler, so I took my key and the remote  controlling time.  You got an Irish pencil dick?  So there's a mark on your remote where your dick ends.  Yes.  Yes.  He's proud of him.  He's, he doesn't seem like a little sissy.

Uh, it was, uh, it was pretty, uh, I was pretty nervous. 
[02:44:00]  Um.  But I'm, I'm talking about looking at a real naked girl.  Her tits, her, her body, her ass.  Like, what is that?  Doesn't that do something to you?

[03:21:30]  because they're only performing to us  they should be performing kind of the  the group  yeah have them just kind of way back  and comics love nothing more than just performing for other comics  because they're such giving audiences  well why don't we bring some of our guys in  to pepper it with real laughter  because these guys aren't going to laugh at anything  with real laughter  yeah it's real  why don't we bring some of the gang in  yeah we had a whole bunch of guys out there  who's that guy just standing out there  in the fucking hallway  um all right  can you just sit down  what's that kid's name

[03:22:30]  yeah right  all right  and fans the uh mc for car crash comedy  so theron set this up again  i really  i haven't paid attention to this bit  i gotta be honest with you  sure  um  well basically each comedian will do two minutes of material  okay  if they have a joke that does not go over very well  they will hear the car crash  as indicated by this  everybody hear that 
[03:23:00]  it's got to come to the speakers  great  what do you want me to do in this bit  um  just morale  general morale  keep it high  i'm good at morale  keep it high  keep the energy up  i'm good at morale  um  no  are you not  terrible  there's no one i've ever met who's worse at morale  oh shit  i said yeah i was waiting for you jimmy jesus  um yeah so if you make it through your whole set with three car crashes  then you have succeeded in

[03:28:30]  oh you got no joke  don't forget about the second part of that awesome joke  okay  i'm sticking with it oak  all right  boy  yeah i actually get in fights with my girl about video games  uh because she wants me to sell back some of my games for money  and uh you know go out to dinner or something  and i'm like sure maybe i could sell back ten of my games at five bucks a piece  but then again you are filled with thousands of dollars worth of fertile eggs  there's something i like him there's something missing from it but i do like the fact 
[03:29:00]  that he's saying sell your ovaries  right  yes  so conceptually it's funny  just not an actual practice  no i mean it's just something  it's not bad  all right quickly  i must say here it is  as a guy that's been doing comedy 15 years  sure  you have smarmy delivery  with non-smarmy jokes  do you understand what i'm saying  yes  you're a little too genius-y with your delivery 
[03:29:30]  okay  you're impressed with yourself  just deliver it like bitch sell your eggs  sell your eggs  your eggs are worth more than blah blah blah instead of you have thousands of dollars worth of eggs  fucking charlton heston just fucking deliver the joke  patrice is implying  that you're acting  he nailed it  he didn't imply anything  i think he's skirting around the issue  that's what it is then  it's fantastic  stop being impressed with yourself  okay  stop being impressed with yourself 
[03:30:00]  so are you guys ready for your first act  yeah  yes  coming to the stage  are you saying that  if dan was trying  he's trying to  in a way  cover his enthusiasm  and joy with ironing  like the fact that  you have a point  you know  i think i think you  yeah i think he hit it  i'm not shit on you  yeah i know  he wants to sit down so badly right now  why  boy does he  just doesn't want to be at that mic  all right  sorry buddy  let's go  he performs all around new york city 
[03:30:30]  very funny guy  it's here for daniel chakran  i used to be a corporate lawyer  and uh to deal with it  i just started drinking jack daniels  all day  yeah i was yeah i was drafting  a billion dollar contracts  blacked out  i was sober up once in a while  just long enough to be like  again  who are we fucking  now you guys probably do coke  to have some fun at a party 
[03:31:00]  uh and the moment the sun comes up in the morning  you're like  eh that's enough for me  no  not me  i was doing lines of coke at noon  because when you  yeah  when you draft a billion dollar contract  you can't do it without a line of coke  and  not because of the billion dollars  but because you have to be there at 7 a.m  but uh i quickly just bottomed out  from all the uh coke and alcohol  and uh now i'm out of work  uh and i collect disability 
[03:31:30]  and yeah  i take a lot of naps  uh i order delivery  and even without a job  i've got so much anxiety  that i can't even open my mail  and that really sucks  because my disability check  comes in the mail  so uh  i was waiting for this  so uh  so uh  i want to see where it is going after that  so i just lie in bed all day  and i watch porn  that's it  just a lot of porn  uh just porn 
[03:32:00]  and uh  i'll go out once in a while at night  to see  if i can meet a real girl  but i'm confused  from watching porn all day  where are the 19 year old asians  who need lots of fucking sex  where  where are they  oh  yes  oh  that was three  yes  that was three  hold on  yo  this is  this is uncomfortable  wow  you um  yes  i actually  uh  you just kind of stated a bunch of facts 
[03:32:30]  um  now the critique comes in  although i found his life  to be pretty fucking interesting  i would say the jokes were not really great  but i  it was  you sober  yes  oh cool  how long  uh  two years  all right cool man  i found that to be very interesting  that he was a lawyer  and uh  you know  fucking blacked out  just fucking shut up  you ex-junkie  stop trying to relate to him  i i  that's exactly what it is  i'm bonding with him on a human level  jim  um  i got a question for jim  you think uh  this guy um  i don't know  liked coke 
[03:33:00]  back in the day  oh my god  i think he loved it  but um  i just  i found it to be interesting  although you know  you might  you might get to the punchlines  a little faster  or at all  all right  yeah just imagine  you're still on coke  just tell super bad  to sit down  let's hear it for daniel  yeah  all right  all right  we're gonna keep the state of the comedy rolling right along here  let's hear it for mark blackman everybody  someone called me nerdzo yesterday

[03:41:30]  do it if you just give me a chance uh uh this is awesome for the delay well for me it's going really  well I smoke a lot of pot probably one of the reasons I'm having a little trouble right now  but I end up watching a lot of television I see all these public service announcements warning you not  to get high you've seen him little fella I saw one of the day with a kid maybe 10 years old and sat 
[03:42:00]  down at a desk in his bedroom cut open five cigarettes and started rolling them all into  one big fatty and then the announcer came on he was like smoking one joint is the equivalent of  smoking five cigarettes whoa I don't know about you all but that really made me think I wish I could  roll like that when I was his age it's a talented little thing oh boo that was an excellent joke  yeah what you want more yeah uh don't fucking turn to me start haggling

[03:44:00]  shitty attitude which is yeah yeah I like that it's good it's good for a cut you know how to get up  this morning fucking miserable it's a comic's not morning people no one even told me what I was  coming here for I got mad at the door by a dude in a trench coat who was like what are you  here and I was like I have no idea wow to be honest all right it's all right all right  yeah Hayley Boyle everybody coming up next uh regular in clubs all over New York City it's Bob

[03:53:30]  but God bless it  Edgar Allen Poe  it's beautiful  okay it's unbelievable  that's why  it'd be like  if New England  named themselves  after a Stephen King  like book  that'd be awesome right  if New England  oh  what happened  I'm a big crush  I didn't  oh  what happened  I did kind of enjoy him though  like you was a  oh yeah  I could see that  you know  you enjoyed that  I did  what do you want from me

[03:54:30]  a little bit  no  I love  I love Jimmy  no I was saying  I kind of  I'm only kidding  Jimmy  I don't think your car crashes  were unjustified at all  oh okay  no no I didn't mean that you  shouldn't have crashed them  I was saying there's something  about it that I  enjoyed  first of all  I am not just the sole judge here  I look around  and I'm taking  no you're not  you're not looking around  I look around  I see Patrice  I see Jimmy  I see Ope  like Jimmy said earlier  the audience  your hand  had a stroke 
[03:55:00]  no like  before  but  that was something  that just was  feeling it  all right  you were feeling it  all right  let's go  all right  she was a wonderful sport  before on the Opie and Anthony show  let's hear it for Shelly Hamilton  She's got some credits  she was on the Opie and Anthony show  thank you  yeah you might remember her  from the Opie and Anthony show  she appears on the show  yeah  uh  Rachel fucking Ray is everywhere  and I don't know why  everywhere 
[03:55:30]  barking for shitty products  they made her the spokesperson  for fucking Dunkin' Donuts  America runs on Dunkin'  why  why  because you're kind of fat  and chipper  shut up you chubby cunt  get out  like  she's everywhere  and like  she's like the Walmart  of people  like she's everywhere  and she's 24-7  and you know that shit's not right  but  I guess sometimes you need  deodorant at 3 o'clock  in the morning  and sometimes you need  an annoying shrew  to teach you how to make  fucking pizza  great  but people support  like I guess  somewhere somebody supports  they're like men  men want to fuck her 
[03:56:00]  there are men that are  attractive  okay I'll tell you  wait  I'll tell you why men  are attracted to her  she is attainable  she's not that pretty  she's not real smart  she's a little chubby  these guys don't have the balls  to go out and get  a fucking stripper  but Rachel Ray  will probably fuck you  she won't say anything  about your tiny little penis  and then when she's finished  she'll roll off with you  and then go make a casserole  and vacuum the living room  so yeah  I'm just not on board  like this little  this version of like  50s little woman 
[03:56:30]  with a martini at the door  how was your day  we burned our bras  knock it off  she's just another  fucking example  of somebody we have to support  because of Oprah  now I can't vote for Obama  I can't vote for Obama  because of Rachel Ray  I can't support Obama  via Rachel Ray  because of Oprah  how's that for a fucking  celebrity daisy chain  it's like six degrees  if you're an asshole  so thanks  that was a good  I like that one  she only got two  yeah  she only should have got one  she only got two  yeah I like that 
[03:57:00]  I like that  yeah  do I have to pull one back  nah I mean you know  I think you should  I think you should  I think you should  I think you should  I think you should do a replay  shut up you chubby cunt  was good  yeah  I wouldn't do that one  if you you know  last time I was standing  but it was  I thought it was enjoyable  yeah  she's going to do a comedy  six months  yeah see  it was very good  she has a  but don't go after Rachel Ray  just don't go there  don't go there  coming next is  Angry Bob 
[03:57:30]  now you're probably wondering  what the Travelocity Gnome  is doing here  and when did he swallow  New England  well anyway  I saw a lot of great comics today  but Angry Bob's the only comic  you can see here  who has his own clothing line  stained stinky and ink  getting laid  see this beautiful outfit here  this did very well  during the holidays  we like to call this little number  burritos at 4am  while masturbating  the reruns of Punky Brewster 
[03:58:00]  and for this week only  you get one free coupon  to stop an Amber Alert  anywhere in the country  now I don't want to ruin your evening  I am a little chubby  but I don't mind being fat  it works with me  I like to eat  but once in a while  this morbid obesity plan  just doesn't work out very well  remember a few years ago  remember that tsunami  remember that 
[03:58:30]  that was me  you get in the bathtub  a little too quickly  water goes over the edge  and all of a sudden  Sumatra is misplaced  I knew what was worse  I rolled over  I scratched myself  and Pluto's not a planet anymore  that's weird  now I'll tell you something  I'm thinking of doing something about it  I think I'm getting the operation  you know  everything's in operation now  you know  you don't want to be a chick  you can be a dude  you don't want to be a Republican  you can be a Democrat  they remove your soul 
[03:59:00]  but now they got the fat operation  I think they take your stomach out  and put broccoli in its place  I went to the doctor though  and the doctor said  this is fucked up  he said I'm too fat  for the fat operation  that's fucked up  that's like they're doing  too pregnant to give birth  can you imagine that  well Mrs. Lipschitz  you know  you're not going to pass that bull  anytime soon  but who knows  in 18 years  you could start charging rent  stop him for his  angry bob 
[03:59:30]  thank you very much  thank you  just  fucking  I liked angry bob  yeah he was good  angry bob  he was good dude  you got anything for him  well I think  it's cool that  like  I think you're very lucky  that you picked angry bob  because you kind of  come off as angry  worked out  thank you  tit  you should change your name  to  less stress bob  and fucking  just say the same things  without screaming  and you're fucking  well I was trying  aneurysm free bob  I enjoyed bob 
[04:00:00]  yeah bob  angry bob  everyone  that's right  bob looks like  he should be fried  watch out  he's angry  he's angry  yeah  don't get on his bedside  whoa hey  he's not moving fast bob  I'm going to stay over here  I'm tentative Jim  that is a stupid parade  I hope the fucking  Cloverfield monster  comes out  he's interested  fucking  fucking idiots 
[04:00:30]  god damn Jimmy  coming up  to the stage  is Rondell Hartley  yeah black dude  alright  I got a scar on my face  which is not weird  I'm used to it  but like little kids  think I'm a pirate  and  like  other people think  I've been in jail  but women love it though 
[04:01:00]  because they think  that I'm dangerous  and mysterious  and I tell them  I'm not dangerous  and mysterious  the guy who cut me  is dangerous  and mysterious  and it's weird though  but like  I've never been locked up  before  but I was arrested  when I was 17 years old  and  the worst part about it  is it was in a small town  that's why I hate small towns  is I hate when they use  like big city lingo  like the cop arresting me  he's like  alright we're going downtown  and I'm like  the police station's  right across the street  what the fuck  are we going downtown for  it's right there  so  but I did  I did visit a friend  my buddy Ricardo 
[04:01:30]  was locked up  which was cool visiting  but like the first thing  he did when he saw me  was hug me  you know  I was like  hey what's up man  I was like  cool man  stop hugging me  that's what's up  you know  and then he kept hugging me  then I had to say  something to him again  I'm like  look man  can you hug me  from the front  god damn it  I did not come out  here for this  and he's getting mad  and he's like  I'm saying it's hard  in here son  I'm like  I know it's hard  it's on my back  get that shit  off my back  so I don't know  it's Black History Month  Michael Jackson's  re-releasing his  Thriller album  which is great  that's when I used  to love Thriller  like you know  Billie Jean beat it 
[04:02:00]  you know  back then  when he was Dominican  so  it's just a cool thing  I just don't like  the white woman  he turned into  that's the only thing  I don't like about him  so that's it  that's all  he was done  yeah okay  went under the wire  there  well the  for Rondell  I'll say obviously  I know Rondell  yeah  and I know he's a very  he's a qualified  good comic  I've seen  he's one of the few guys  I've seen it  in front of real audiences  I like the fact  you open talk about  the scar  I never saw you  do that before  it's good 
[04:02:30]  why did the guy  cut you  do you ever say  his act  oh chicks  okay  he was doing comedy  yeah  wow  I like that  oh Rondell  and finally  our headliner  for today  that's not him  Rondell  oh it's  we got one more  Adam  yes  very talented  intern Adam  everybody  we had Angry Bob  now we have 
[04:03:00]  asexual Adam  hey thanks for  breaking my spirit  earlier guys  I really appreciate it  but let me tell you  a little bit about myself  I'm from Michigan  yes I am  and so this is my  first time in the big city  and when I first got  hired as an O&A intern  I was pumped  I was ready to  carpe the fucking  diem man  I was  my life's gonna change  this is gonna be  my big break  oh you know  my life is actually  changing  one coffee  breakfast run  and club soda 
[04:03:30]  Kenny tongue lashing  at a time  you know  my friends  always go  and they always say  they always say  you know  what's it like  in the big apple  this is  you know  it's so great  and I go  and they say  you must be  living the dream  and I go  well if you want  to call  living the dream  buying a  plain toasted bagel  and Canada Dry  every fucking  weekday  at five in the  morning  then I guess  I'm living it  that's a little 
[04:04:00]  jab on me  a lot of  inside show  records  yeah it's good  that's comic standing  is filmed in the  fucking studio  and what's with  that elevator  it's slow  sorry  but I want to  just a little  things have been  pissing me off  the Heath Ledger  the Heath Ledger  coverage  the press  I think it's funny  not that he died  but the fact that  the masseuse  tried to call  Mary Kate  something like  nine times 
[04:04:30]  anybody knows  that to get an  Olsen twin over  to any place  you just put a  bunch of  Reesey Pieces  on the floor  little ET  fucking lookalikes  Reesey Pieces  Reesey Pieces  what the fuck  are you trying  to rip off  Rich Boss's act  Reesey Pieces  Reesey Pieces  did I say it  like that  yeah you said  Reesey Pieces  it was  Reese's Pieces  that's probably  better  but I don't think  it was quite  the wording  as opposed 
[04:05:00]  to the collective  unfunniness  of the joke  itself  but  let's hear it  for Adam  everybody  and all your  comedians  and turn Adam  so we should  take a break  and pick the  five winners  I'm thinking  oh there's  five winners  yeah  of course  Adam can we  have one question  how long have you  been performing  Adam  hold on buddy  that's not on  how about that one  yeah  since about the  beginning of the
