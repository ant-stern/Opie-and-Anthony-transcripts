<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with a discussion of their controversial broadcasting history, quickly transitioning into a debate about *Back to the Future*'s timeline inconsistencies and the aging of its cast, including Michael J. Fox's Parkinson's disease.  A caller, "Dr. Rape Kid," offers crude commentary on taxes and the upcoming election, sparking a highly offensive political discussion targeting Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Andrew Cuomo, and others, while praising Jimmy McMillan. The hosts delve into father-son relationships in various fields and heavily criticize Michael Bloomberg. A heated exchange ensues with a listener who challenges Anthony's political views. The conversation then shifts to the Dallas Cowboys' season, Tony Romo's injury (speculated to be faked), the Yankees' firing of their pitching coach, A-Rod's performance, and Jeter's potential return.  A "Jocktober" segment is announced.

The show then features a lengthy in-studio interview with Alex Kigorski (also referred to as Alex Dabagorski in another summary), an Ice Road Trucker, who discusses the challenges of driving his exceptionally large truck in New York City, detailing its interior and his personal life, including his eleven children.  The interview covers the dangerous conditions of ice road trucking, near-misses, preparation, and encounters with wildlife.  The lack of bathroom facilities on long hauls leads to humorous discussion about accidental defecation.  Listener calls, including one from a childhood acquaintance, are interspersed throughout the interview.

Following the interview, Opie and Anthony discuss a seemingly intoxicated Larry King interview with Julian Assange, playing audio and video clips.  They later analyze a Larry King interview with a rape victim, reacting with dark humor to King's insensitive questioning and focusing on his queries about the victim's groceries. Clips from this interview are also played. The hosts speculate about Larry King's impending death and retirement.

A significant portion is dedicated to "Jocktober," dissecting a low-quality "fugitive" radio promotion from iPower 92.1 in Richmond, Virginia, with the hosts participating in the station's online chat room and noting numerous vulgar screen names.  In-studio guests include comedian Joe DeRosa, who promotes his shows, and Carrie Byron from *Mythbusters*.  The hosts, particularly Danny, express strong infatuation with Byron.  The interview covers Byron's career, experiences on *Mythbusters* (including blowing up a cement mixer, testing bug bombs, a helicopter/remote-controlled car demolition derby, a stunt plane experiment, and a water torture experiment), her fears, the show's insurance issues, and filming challenges.  A critique of *Star Wars* ensues with DeRosa's participation.  Throughout this segment, E-Rock struggles with various tasks, prompting further humorous commentary.  The discussion also touches upon the movie *A Few Good Men* and its famous line.  The show concludes with further discussion of Carrie Byron's career and future work.  Throughout the entire broadcast, highly offensive and vulgar language is frequently used.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio  Satellite radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  Fun dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream  The show is a lot funnier on any W  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie here  Non-to-regional steam  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn 
[00:00:30]  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, all right  We just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  Is this the last straw for the rocking radio duo?  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Good evening  I'm Dr. Emmett Brown  I'm standing on the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall  It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985  And this is temporal experiment number one 
[00:01:00]  My calculations are correct  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour  You're going to see some serious shit  Oh, yeah  But that was 85  Yeah, but he was going  At that point, he was going to go 25 years in the future  Yeah, but he didn't  So that clip doesn't mean anything to me, anyway  Well, but he didn't get to  And it was Saturday  It was Saturday  It was 1985 
[00:01:30]  Why is Z-Rock playing that clip?  Because it's  I know, then you go into the future 25 years  But we didn't actually go into the future 25 years  So we just started the show saying that it's 1985  We went 30 years  He went 30 years  But he was going 25 at that point  25 at that point  A total of 30 years?  No, it would have been just 25 years  It would have been today  But the Libyans came  And Marty had to go back to 1955 
[00:02:00]  What happened?  Yeah, that was the setting  Oh  But it would have been, you know  25 years  It was initially where he was going to go  And then it was like  Oh, what am I crazy?  I forgot plutonium  How was I going to get back?  And then that's when the Libyans showed up  And, you know, the hijinks  That ensued after that  But, yeah, the initial thing was going to be 25 years  And as we said yesterday  He was going to be very disappointed  When he popped out and realized 
[00:02:30]  Wait, wait a minute  There's still JCPenney's here  It's still just a mall  It's not a spaceport  And, uh, yeah  That's about it  Yeah, that's about it  Nothing really has changed  DVD's out today on Blu-ray  Got some extras  Yeah?  Yeah  What the hell?  They were all in town last night?  Yeah, we tried to get a few of them on the show  But, uh  Once again, we failed  Imagine getting those posters signed  Roland's only been on the job for a few days 
[00:03:00]  But, uh, we couldn't get them back to the future, guys  Yeah  I thought we'd get Lloyd  Yeah, that would have been good  Christopher Lloyd  I thought we would have gotten him, at least  He's been on the show  Mm-hmm  The rest of them, yeah  I don't know  But they looked pretty good on TV  They were being interviewed  And Michael J. Fox wasn't shaking that much  You were sitting there chomping at the bit  You wanted to make some jokes  And I'm looking at you  No, no, I didn't want to make jokes  And I had to say to you  That he doesn't look that bad  Considering he's been fighting this for almost 20 years  I know, I don't want to make jokes 
[00:03:30]  Parkinson's is a motherfucker  But he can't talk  And he's shuffling a little bit  He wasn't shuffling that much  I know, but he has trouble talking  And for somebody that was so articulate  Mm-hmm  And, uh, spoke very well  Mm-hmm  In the movies  It was, you know, kind of hard to watch  Leah Thompson, I guess her name is  Yes  Wow, she looked pretty good  Considering she's now  She looks bad  49 years old  Yeah  She looked like she hasn't aged at all  She didn't look bad at all  And then, um, how come they didn't have the original, um, Jen 
[00:04:00]  The girlfriend  They should bring her back  Does she do, like, Comic-Cons or something?  Of course she does  They all do  Where did she go?  She was pretty  She was a lot hotter than  Than the stupid  What's her name?  Elizabeth Shue  Good old Elizabeth Shue, right?  Who ended up in the second, uh, and third one  Hey, somebody wants to, uh, school you on taxes, Anthony  Oh, alright, school me  Go ahead  This is so early for this, but  Yeah, go ahead 
[00:04:30]  Dr. Rape Kid wants to school Anthony on tax issues  Go ahead, Dr. Rape Kid  Let her rip, sir  Well, Anthony, it's, uh, one week before Election Day  So I thought I would just call you and tell you  And campaign  Alright, go ahead  Well, no, just that, uh, you shouldn't worry if, you know, Obama  And anyone in the Senate or Congress  Decides to let the Bush tax cuts expire for people  Fancy men like you  Yeah  Yeah  Why?  You have nothing to worry  Because all they're trying to do, first of all, is to get about $700 or $800 billion back into the economy 
[00:05:00]  Secondly, uh, the tax code's only gonna go up from 35%, which is what the average person in your bracket is paying  To what Clinton levels were at 39%, and  Oh, that's all  And during Bill Clinton's whole administration, he did gain, uh, over 22 million, 22 million jobs  That's all, just 35 to 39%  That's a lot of money, dude, almost 40% of your money is a lot of money  That's a lot of fucking money, pal 
[00:05:30]  Compared to what they were paying back in Dwight Eisenhower's day  We're talking, we don't live then  Yeah, fuck Eisenhower's days  Yeah, we, none of us lived back then  That's a lot of money, man  The government is taking a fuckload of my money  See, when people  And that's federal tax, my friend  How about state taxes  And  City taxes for us  City taxes  My fucking, uh, uh, uh, property taxes  Like, I'm paying too much of my money in taxes  And when you have to say, uh, compare to 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, yeah  You know the taxes are too high  Anyone that says compare to when blah blah was president  You know the taxes are too high  Yeah  Me and Jimmy pay three taxes  Uh, federal, state, and we have to pay something called city taxes  How insane is that?  Oh, I have to throw in the other one  The, uh, fucking, uh, Metro  The MTA tax  Oh, the MTA tax  I forgot about that  I'll pay that one too  And then you throw some money  Because I drive in every day  And I pay my tolls  I still gotta pay for the fucking trains  Yeah, don't get us started, man  That's too much, dude 
[00:06:30]  That's where I'm with these guys  The tax thing is just ridiculous  It's out of control  Get him out  Then you put a little money in the bank  And then they tax that  But it was  But that money was already taxed  Yeah, yeah  And then any money you make on that  Any money you take  That they fucking, uh, give you  Out of the kindness of their heart  That you invest  And take a chance  And actually make money on  They gotta grab their fucking greedy hands into that too  Capital gains taxes  They're going up, my friend  Under, uh, Obama 
[00:07:00]  They're going up  You know why?  His constituency isn't in the fucking market  It's the elite  The elite rich  Oh, they're in the stock market  Let's take the evil people's money  Go fuck yourself  The Republicans are going to sweep  Get the Democrats out  Make this fucker a lame duck  For two more fucking years  And then get his fucking ass out  Well, you gotta slow down a little bit  Because some of the Democrats  Are begging Obama not to endorse them anymore  I know, exactly  That's on the front page of the paper 
[00:07:30]  He's a one-termer  We got this out of the way  How is Clinton such a light Democrat  As far as  Like, he seemed like he was very good with the economy  And I know Obama  Obama inherited kind of a mess  But he's done nothing to make it better  Like, literally nothing to make it better  Clinton wound up getting a surplus  Because, yeah, he was bringing in a lot of money  He wasn't spending a fuckload of money  If you noticed, a lot of Clinton's agenda  Didn't really, the healthcare thing 
[00:08:00]  When he saw that that wasn't working out  He just bailed on that  He also wasn't involved in many quagmires of war, Anthony  Yeah, exactly  He didn't have that to deal with  Quagmires, nice  He also was trying to, you know, make peace around the world  You'd see him, you know, being the diplomat and everything like that  It wasn't every two seconds  He's got his pen out with the speaker of the cunt  Sitting there trying to fucking tax and spend 
[00:08:30]  Tax and spend  How is Bronze Boehner going to make us better?  How is Boner going to make us better?  Pronounce his name properly  Boner  Boner's dead, brother  Because he's not fucking Pelosi  That's why  Anthony, I think you have to understand  Get out and vote, Republicans  Get out and vote  Let's kick these fucking tax and spend cocksuckers out  She's terrible  She really is a hateable woman  She's despised 
[00:09:00]  She really is  Her approval rating's in the shitter  And her big excuses  With the rest of them are saying  We haven't done enough  To show the dumb Americans  How much we've done for them  Really?  Really?  I think we could see it ourselves  We don't need an explanation  From the likes of that  Old dried up uterus  And fucking tax and spend  Barry  Way to go, Rape Kid  You put us all in a bad mood  Thanks  Are you happy now?  Get the vote out  Are you happy?  Independents  Republicans  Get the vote out 
[00:09:30]  Let the Democrats sit on their ass  And eat Cheetos  Can we at least have Jimmy McMillan in there?  I am voting for Jimmy McMillan  The rent and the taxes are too damn high  Believe me  The only Democrat I'm voting for  Is for the governor of New York State  I am voting for Jimmy McMillan  Rent too damn high  Too damn high  And he said he's going to win the whole thing  Because of the SNL parody  Of course  He's guaranteeing victory now  Because of SNL  Of course  SNL put him over the top  By the way  It's a total goof vote  Cuomo's in  Cuomo stinks though 
[00:10:00]  I hate Cuomo  Fucking daddy's boy  Hate him  Fucking daddy's boy  Did you hear his point on medical marijuana?  No!  Yeah  I didn't hear it  He said he's totally against it  Because there's  The harm is more than the good here  Is it really?  If you're fucking dying  And want a little relief  Yeah that's worse  Than maybe some people  Getting their hands on it  And smoking some weed  And hanging out  And doing nothing  Has a father-son combo ever worked?  You could go with the Bush senior 
[00:10:30]  The Bush junior  John Quincy  John Quincy Adams  That worked  I have no idea  I was very  I'm talking about  All walks of life  Like you don't see  Willie Mays' kid  Playing baseball  Yeah  Like when has it ever worked  Where the father was  Really good at his job  Whether you liked him or not  And then the son stepped in  And was just as good  Name one  Yeah Ripken  Cal Ripken  Ripken and Ripken Jr.  Yeah  I think the son was a lot better  Than the old man 
[00:11:00]  Well I'm not saying  They're exactly the same  I'm talking the old man  Unbelievable  Son  Unbelievable too  You got sort of a  Vito Corleone and Michael  I think Cal Ripken Sr.  Was a better manager  Than he was a player  Yeah  Yeah  Ken Griffey  Barry and Bobby Bonds  Ken Griffey  Ken Griffey Jr.  Is a strong one  Okay  Barry and Bobby Bonds  Barry and Bobby  They're mostly sports examples  I think though  What about some guy  That had a great plumbing business  In like Seaford  Is his son running the business now 
[00:11:30]  Janellian Sons  Janellian Sons  Is another fine example  Of what  Fucking rape  Kip putting us in a bad mood  If we want to talk politics though  We got to beat the shit out of Bloomberg  Did you hear what he  Fucking said yesterday  Oh my god  This guy  This cocksucker  Every day says something  That is infuriating  So Bloomberg had a couple terms  As mayor of New York City  Three  And about a year ago  Was it now  I don't even remember  He decided  I need a third term  But the problem was 
[00:12:00]  That was against the law  It was against the law  And he was against Rudy  When he wanted it  And he was against Rudy  When Rudy wanted a third term  And Rudy wanted to  Because the situation was  It was right after 9-11  Rudy was doing a good job  As leader of New York  We all wanted Rudy  To continue  At that point  Bloomberg said  No  We must stick to the law here  This is what  As Americans  We shouldn't let this  Deter us from  Just being ourselves  And doing what we normally do  He gets elected  To be mayor of New York 
[00:12:30]  After a couple of terms  He's like  Hey  I dig this gig  I want three terms  Well there's a law against it  Oh yeah  I'm not even going to put this up  For a vote  For the people  I'm just going to go  And say  Three terms now  Are available  I don't even think  The law was changed  I think he just did it  Yeah  I don't think the law  Was even officially changed  He had some behind the scenes  Some weird shit behind the scenes  He went to the officials  That were behind him  And had a change  I don't know  But the people didn't vote 
[00:13:00]  He spent a hundred million  To get elected  So now  He says yesterday  That he wants it  To go back to two terms  He wants two terms  He's a fucking  He actually said  He only wanted  Three terms for him  He's fucking  A despicable  Rich guy  That's what he is  Out of touch  They're all criminals  They're all criminals  He wanted it just for him  And his excuse was  That New York  Was in financial straits 
[00:13:30]  And you needed him  In office  Well that's exactly  What we wanted with Giuliani  Exactly  We were all  We were under attack  And we kind of felt  Comfortable with the guy  That was there  I'm just saying comfortable  Because I know  I liked Rudy a lot more  I know there's a bunch of guys  That did not like Rudy  Whatsoever  They came together  September 11th  They hated him  Yeah  September 10th  Well September 10th  Yeah  And then the 11th  The morning of the 11th  And then the 12th  They loved him  Yeah  But a lot of guys  Never forgot  What Giuliani did  To their paychecks 
[00:14:00]  And their jobs  So  Hey  Father son combo  Here's a great one  Anthony  We missed the obvious  Michael Douglas  And Emilio Estevez  Oh yeah  What  I don't know  Oh you know what  Kirk Michael Douglas  Emilio Estevez  And Charlie  And Martin Sheen  It would be Martin Sheen  I mean Martin Sheen  And Emilio Estevez  And Charlie Sheen  But you know  I'm just talking platoon  I think that guy  Decided to put them together  And really confuse everybody  And let's not forget  The Mannings  I mean you got Archie  And then you got  Payton and Eli 
[00:14:30]  Well that's true  Yeah  That's a biggie too  Yeah  Yeah  But the Cuomo  Cuomo thing  I don't know  Cuomo  Stupid Cuomo  Another fucking business  As usual politician  I'm so sick of it  He's just a sissy boy  Fucking daddy's boy  That's all  He's a fucking  You know what he is  He's a simp  He's a fucking simp  I like this Jimmy McMillan  Even though he's a complete kook  Oh yeah  You know what  At least he's not one  That's what it's come to  You want somebody  Who's just not one of them 
[00:15:00]  Not on the inside  The career politician  Well let's get Jimmy McMillan  On the phone man  Because he's guaranteeing victory  Oh yeah  He was on Hannity  How did he do on Hannity  I don't know  I didn't see it  Somebody just said it  On the show radio  I heard Hannity liked him a lot  No he was on the TV show  On TV  On the TV  On the TV  Yeah  Oh boy  Democrats know that this  They got Bill out stumping  Yeah Bill's out there  He's not drawing a lot of people  At his events  A lot of these Democrats

[00:16:00]  But this goes for every president  You got the job for four years  How about you sit in the fucking White House  And do shit  Instead of hitting the campaign trail  Oh I know  I hate when these guys do it  I don't care which guy's in there  It's like they spend half their fucking job  Endorsing other people  And going around the country  Sit in the fucking White House  And try to change shit  Well the good thing about Obama is  I'd rather him be out on the campaign trail  Than fucking more shit  Than fucking more shit up  Exactly  But in general you understand what I'm saying  In general yeah  The president  How the president can just stop working 
[00:16:30]  And try to get his buddies  His buddies back in their fucking jobs  Is illegal  It just sounds illegal  Oh my god  Look at Harrison Ford  Oh boy  He looks like Vinnie Brand now  What the fuck happened to him  May the force be with you  Harrison Ford's focus on biodiversity  Wow he's bored  Oh my god  Does he have an earring  Stop with the earring  Yeah  You fucking old actors  Look idiotic  He doesn't look that bad  He looks terrible  Look at his left ear

[00:17:30]  That's doing very well  Sure  But in general  You see a lot of these guys  That get a big gig  Because of their father  And then  They just suck at it  I do not want  Fucking Cuomo  Simp of a son  He's in  You're gonna have him  Your son  Is attempting to run  For governor  The state is really fucked up  Man  The best guy for the job  Had to do the hooker thing  Spitzer is way better  Than any of those guys  Yeah  Cuomo's gonna be in there  And you're just gonna see 
[00:18:00]  More  Taxes  Tax the shit out of us  And I love how it's like  We're not gonna raise taxes  On the middle class  And meanwhile  The middle class  Has been lowered down  To fucking poverty level  Already  Yeah yeah  They consider that  Middle class  That's not a victory  At this point  They need to lower  People's taxes  Lower taxes  Not to say that  We're not gonna  You know  Raise them anymore  Lower taxes  Or keep them the same  For the people  That are giving people jobs  And then watch  Unemployment dip down  Below these levels  That haven't been seen 
[00:18:30]  In decades  How about you do that  That's too logical  How about that simple  That's too logical  Instead of cutting the taxes  For the people  That are not contributing  To society  That's what you're doing  You're giving a bunch of shit  To people  That aren't giving back  To the country  On the backs of the people  That are employing people  So they have to cut jobs  To keep their head above water  It's that simple  It really is that simple  If anyone wants to call  And debate it  Go fuck yourself 
[00:19:00]  Because it's that simple  People have said it  I've never gotten hired  By a poor person  They've never given me a job  It's middle class  Upper middle class  And wealthy people  That hire other people  Whether it's just  To do work in your house  Or they run a big company  And employ thousands of people  They're the ones  That are making the economy  They are making employment  For people  They're getting people to work  And spend money  And what Obama's doing 
[00:19:30]  Is the opposite  Let's bring up  The people behind us  You're not bringing them  Up to the level  That they're hiring people  You're keeping a welfare state  You're putting the burden  On the people  That are helping  And employing the country  And that's why  Unemployment is  Kicking at 10%  You fuckwad douche  Well you're going to have  To clean that up  Ah well  I mean that was perfect  I had to do it  For satellite radio  Yeah but now  You can't be on TV  You can't be on TV  With that shit  I implore you people 
[00:20:00]  If you are registered voters  Get out there  And let's get rid  Of this fucking disaster  Get a new disaster in there  I'm fine with that  And see what that happens  But they have a lock  The Democrats have  Too big a lock  On what's going on  Everything gets passed  Let the Republicans  Get in there  They'll try to pass legislation  Obama's going to veto it  And nothing will get done  It'll be great  That'll be terrific  Because that's how things  Work at their best  When nothing gets done 
[00:20:30]  That's just wonderful  It's  Our country can't figure  Shit out anymore  I know  It's unbelievable  You know how much  I wanted the Democrats  Because the Republicans  Are bad for us  As what we do for a living  They're bad for us  They're the ones  It's not the Democrats  As much as they're  Politically correct asses  That tenfolded  The FCC fines  That was the conservative  Type of  So it's like  I wanted  Liberals  To balance that out  No one wants  That either  That's why the Democrats  Won 
[00:21:00]  Is because everyone  Was sick of the  Right wing  Religious right  Conservative Republicans  There's  A lot of  Independence  What the polling  Polls are saying  Is a lot of  Independent voters  Are voting Republican  This time around  Because they are  Disgusted with what  The Democrats have done  But you know how bad  You have to fuck up  Two years  After Bush  Left  To have people  Going fuck man  The Republicans  Weren't that  Yeah  I can't stand  What this guy  Is doing  I don't want to say  It's a shell game 
[00:21:30]  It's too dramatic  But it really is  It's one or the other  One or the other  They have put too much  Government in your lives  And the Republicans  Do this with their  Morality and shit like that  And that's what they've  Done with us  And stuff  But the Democrats  Want to be in your life  They want to protect you  And save you  And help everybody  They're fucking  Robin Hoods  They're Robin Hoods  Taking from  Not even the rich  They take from anyone  That has any  Any type of success  In this country  And spread it out 
[00:22:00]  To people  That are just  Going to be a burden  And you're going to  Have to deal with  Some fucking angry people  Fuck you  Yeah let's see how  You handle Dan  In Cleveland  Go ahead Dan  Alright Dan  Hello Dan  Make it quick  Because we got a lot  Of calls coming in  Right now Dan  I just got one question  I'm not here  I'm a long time listener  Welcome aboard Dan  I'm just curious  You want the Republicans  Back in  What did that do  For us with the whole  Eight years of Bush  What's your take on that  What did it do with  The whole eight years of Bush  Yeah  I think history has shown us 
[00:22:30]  What it's done  What do you want  An answer from me  We know what happened  In the eight years of Bush  It's just going to  Two wars  All over again  No it's  No it's  Unbalance of power  If you go  All Democrat  Or all Republican  Then you're  You're looking at  Unbalance  You've got to have  The checks and bails  Exactly  We haven't had  A checks and balance  For two fucking years  And look at the disaster  Obama's gotten us in  Look at the economic disaster  Obama has gotten us in  In two fucking years  Of having carte blanche 
[00:23:00]  To pass whatever  The fuck he wants  But the knee jerk reaction  To just say  Fuck all the Democrats  And throw all the fucking  Republicans back in  And then here's  What's going to happen  Then we're going to be  Fucking sunk  From the other side  Yep  You're going to have  The extreme right wing  That's sinking the ship  It's got to be  A checks and balances system  And that's what's  Going to happen  The White House  Is Democrat  You get a Republican  House  And nothing gets done  It'll be great  Do you know  It's amazing  How it's literally  They have it  Like Clinton's a smart guy 
[00:23:30]  And you listen to him  And he's blaming  The Republicans  And then you hear  A really smart Republican  They're blaming the Democrats  They have it set up  So it's like  They just fucking  Blame each other  Yeah  That's all they do  And these are smart people  You can't decipher it  The Conservatives  No, no, no  It's because of the Democrats  And then the Democrats  You go  Wow, look at that mess  Bush left  They fucking both stink  Yeah  I agree  The only thing I know  I don't want  I don't want  The liberal Democrat 
[00:24:00]  Coddling  Of this fucking country  Where everyone's  Got to be  Picked up  And kissed on the head  And rocked to sleep  With the government  Just shoving their fist  Up your ass  To help  Adam in Jersey  Adam  Yeah  I'm going to get yelled at  But I'll try anyway  I was going to say  That Anthony is  Advocating  Voting against  His own best interest 
[00:24:30]  Now, not in the sense  Of taxes  I understand  Anthony, absolutely  You should vote  The way you want to vote  Because of the tax issue  Because your taxes  Are going up  Yes  And gay marriage too  Yes, gay marriage  And I totally agree with that  But  The problem is  That we want people  Who are  Fiscally conservative  But socially liberal  At least that's what I want  Yeah, try to find them  And that's what you're not getting  With either party  The Republicans  Are fake  Fiscally conservative  The Democrats  Just outright  Are not physically conservative 
[00:25:00]  But  The Republicans  Most of them  At least the people  That are on the ballot  Right now  Are  Socially conservative  Which is  Bad for you guys  Just what  Opie was saying before  I'd rather take  I'd rather take that evil  Than the fucking evil  That is  What the Democrats  Have  Been doing  To this country  For the past two years  Since they've had  Carte Blanche  I'd rather have  A split 
[00:25:30]  Where the Republicans  Are running the House  And the Democrats  Have the White House  I'd rather have that  Than have what we have now  Because  He's destroying  Destroying  What makes this country  Or has made this country  Great over the years  But I don't think  The Republicans  Are going to do any better  When they go out  The only thing we're going to see  Hey Kreskin  Hey Kreskin  Don't predict the future  Okay  I'm basing my  I'm basing my fucking vote 
[00:26:00]  On what's happened  The past couple of years  I'm not going to go  Into a voting booth  And vote for what  Has happened  The past two years  I'll vote for the mystery  Of what's going to be  The next two years  Alright let's go to  Steve on Long Island  Steve  Good morning boys  Good morning  Listen  Anthony  Fucking rape kid  I hate you  Listen  Let's have a real conversation  Without you screaming  He's starting this shit  Alright  You yelling  Doesn't make you right  And by the way  Let me preface this  Before you start  Because I'm reading  What the screener wrote  By real conversation 
[00:26:30]  You mean your opinion's right  And I'm just a puppet  Of Fox News  Now go ahead  Go ahead  Go ahead  Wrong Anthony  First of all  Don't get aggressive  Because you do all the time  You do  That doesn't make you right  That's true  Alright sweetheart  I'm sorry  Sorry baby doll  Okay  Let's stop playing games  Okay  Yeah let's  You're telling me  That Obama raised the deficit  The fact of the matter is  The last budget under Bush  Was 1.46 trillion  Guess what  It's already been reduced 
[00:27:00]  By 1.9 trillion  If you're trying  If you're even trying to tell me  That Obama has reduced the deficit  Anthony  Where the fuck are you getting your numbers  Where am I getting my numbers  Yeah yeah  Okay  You're telling me  Everything passed  Nothing passes the fucking Senate  Anthony  It goes from the House  And dies in the Senate  Because  Blue dog Democrats  And Republicans  Yeah cause they  They know  They know not to  They know not to vote along 
[00:27:30]  With fucking Obama  Cause they want to keep  Their fucking job  Anthony  They're serving their corporate master  Have you not realized  Man  Their corporate master  Yeah  Here we go again  I agree wholeheartedly  Oh really  I'm a conspiracy theory person  Now let me  Let me  Let me  Preference this  Alright  Preface  Preference  That both sides  Are pieces of shit  Language sir  We've already determined that  Let's understand that  But  There's been 
[00:28:00]  More filibusters  About stuff  That  That will help  The middle class  Anthony  Oh really  They wouldn't pass  Anthony  They wouldn't pass  To help the god damn  9-11 people  9-11 workers  You know this  To be fact  Yeah that  That's crazy  Yeah you know  That is crazy  Yeah well  Who's this  Who's this  They shit  When the democrats  Have the majority  And even have  A filibuster proof  Majority  A filibuster proof  Majority  Who is the who 
[00:28:30]  That isn't  Fucking giving  9-11 victims  The health  Care they need  You tell me  Do you want me to list  The name of  Republican senators  That have voted against  Yes  Every  Even if it's  Every single one of them  The democrats  Have a filibuster  Proof  Fucking  Why are you blaming  The republicans  They can't do shit  The republicans  Cannot do shit  Right now  Anything  They never had  A majority proof  Because you got  Lieberman  Who rides 
[00:29:00]  The fucking train  With the republicans  That ain't my fucking problem  Exactly  That ain't your fucking problem  But what is your problem  Is the fact  That your misinformation  That you are speaking  So you're giving  The majority house  And majority senate  A free pass  Because the republicans  Don't want to vote  Along with Obama  Wow  Wow  You got a great point there  Instead of pointing out  The majority  House and senate  You point out  The minority  And one independent  Holy shit  Wow  You sure got me there 
[00:29:30]  Really  Once again  You did not have  A majority  The corporate master  Man  You know what  You forgot where you came from  Lose your money  I know where I came from  Huntington Long Island  A nice rich  Enclave  You weren't rich  None of us were rich  I was a poor as dirt  Motherfucker  None of us  None of us were rich  Until recently  I want to keep some of my cash  Motherfucker  You know what  I got to say  Anthony didn't forget  Where he came from  No  I'm a drunk now 
[00:30:00]  And it's a guy  Who fucking knows  What it's like  To be totally broke  And sleep in your car  And then you work  Yeah you get lucky breaks  And you get talent  Right  But then when you feel like  Your shit is being taken away  By people who aren't  Willing to work for it  Or by  That's where you start  To get pissed off  That way you feel like  You're doing your fair share  And you're helping  No one minds  Fucking helping people  Yeah  Well  But not to this extent  I'm being raped  Unfortunately I can't find  One person that agrees with you  Of course  It's a generous guy  Not one fucking person 
[00:30:30]  Generous to a fault  As much as Ant sounds like a creep  He's a generous guy  He's not a fucking chiseler  Oh my god  Not one person agreeing with you today  Yeah whatever  What are you gonna do  That's because I  You know  You're gonna  You're gonna get the people  That are all upset  Yeah there's a few people  You're not getting the people  That really are like  Okay  You didn't buy that  That easily did you  Yeah I actually did  There's people  There's people agreeing with you  As well  Alright a week to go 
[00:31:00]  Thank god  That's it  I hated that  I hated the conservatives  That they were in  Because to me  They fucking  They really scared me  With locking up pornography  Socially they terrified me  They were terrible men  I hate conservative Republicans 
[00:31:30]  I hate ultra right wingers  They're dangerous  Yes  They're out of touch  And they're crazy  They're fucking  Literally crazy  Trying to govern  By some  Holy entity  In the sky  It's crazy  But the liberal  Left wing  Hard left  Democrats  Just as nutty  Alright more importantly  And out of touch  Completely out of touch  More importantly  Jim Norton's Cowboys  Are done for the season 
[00:32:00]  They suck dude  With Tony Romo  Getting a broken clavicle  Oh did he break a bone  Clavicle  Oh you didn't see the game  Last night  I watched  You know I was just  His left clavicle  Is not looking too good  I was not in his throwing arm  But fuck  I was so angry last night  For two hours  Because I saw the game was on  And I'm like we have  Michael K. Williams on Friday  Omar from The Wire  Coming in  He's a good guest  So I wanted to get my picture signed  And I realized  I couldn't find my photo  With one of my favorite characters  Of all time  Oh shit  I was going through my time machine 
[00:32:30]  I actually  Fucking  You can't see where I whipped myself  With a cord  But you can see where I fucking  Holy shit  I took a  I took a fucking  An unsharpened pencil  And I just drove it against  I was going to stab myself  With a pencil  What the fuck  Oh dear man  I was so angry at myself  For being  It's like how stupid  That's insane  Am I  That's creepy  He was frustrated  My stupidity  But where's the picture  I found it  Because people think I'm crazy  Of course you're going to find it eventually 
[00:33:00]  No but on an old fucking camera disc  That I had saved  Oh wow  But to be so  I had this happen with my  Woody Allen photo too  It's like  To be so dumb and careless  I was just like  I'm a  What'd you do with that  Take a corkscrew to your head  I had a fucking  Wait but to the point of like  Stabbing yourself  With a pen  You don't understand  If I had a knife handy  I wouldn't have killed myself  But I literally would have  Stuck it in my arm  Just out of  But deservedly so  No  Yes  No that's  No that's  No that's crazy talk  Losing a picture  Does not deserve 
[00:33:30]  We can't sit here  And say yes  You're right  Losing a picture doesn't  But being so  Fucking stupid  No  Does  You would make an awful gun owner  Dude  There's a reason I don't have one  You would be an awful gun owner  I so understand rage  But not to that level  That's crazy rage  Wow  That's insane  It's fucking  You almost stabbed yourself  He has  Jimmy's ripping off Artie Lang  Oh my god  That's what's happened  I have  I was just so fucking mad  At myself  For being so dumb 
[00:34:00]  And I have one copy  Of the photo  But it's on my  My big computer  And I guess I've been  Toying with effects  Because I have  The copy of Ant  Michael K. Williams  And Bob Kelly  Is pristine  But then the copy I have  Of me and him  It had a circle around it  Like you know how you toy  An iPhoto with the effects  Yeah yeah  I put like a fade around it  But I guess I saved it  And didn't mean to  Oh no  So my girlfriend's like  Oh you were trying to put  A little frame around you  And your friend  Now I know why 
[00:34:30]  You stabbed yourself  That's the real reason  You can't fuck around with that  We had  Angry at myself  We had a black star in here  And my photo with him was  He was so dark in the photo  I tried to lighten it up  Yeah very hard  To the point  I looked like I had scurvy  You got it  Well you got to  Isolate them  I'm not that good at it  And then photoshop  Just their face  Oh  And  You got to segregate them  From the photo  Is what I'm saying  I see  And maybe roto  Around him  And then just 
[00:35:00]  You put effects on there  You're not using carbonite  It's a fine sponsor we have  I know no  I have  Was it a carbonite problem  That's a great idea actually  Yeah  Well we've been talking about it  For years  Yeah no I know  It's a terrific company  I have  I have  I sent it to the gallery  See there you go  See when you take a photo  With a  A very dark star  It fucks up your face  It does  And then you got to  Photoshop each other  To balance it out  I have  I sent it to the photo place  I'm like the white balance  Is a little off  Could you  Because I look like 
[00:35:30]  I'm just glowing  The white balance  Is a little off  And I go  Yeah we know what you mean  I think there'd be a lot less  We got it  I think there'd be a lot less  Stress in your life Jimmy  If you just got rid of that  Whole fucking celebrity photo thing  Oh my god  It's getting way too stressful  But it's  It's not because  It wasn't that  It was something else dude  But it's getting to a point  Where you're almost  Stabbing yourself  And you did whip yourself  Is there a whip mark  Self-flagellation  Is there a whip mark  You were just really  Yeah I just had a core  I had a fucking  A hard drive cord  And I just fucking slapped  I used to love beating myself up  Let me see the scrape  On your arm  That was a pencil 
[00:36:00]  It was an unsharpened pencil  Unsharpened pencil  And you just went like that  No I just was like  And skinned yourself  I just drove it down  Into my arm  And it actually skidded  Farther than I thought it would  But still  Ow  Look at my glowing white face  Here's the photo  Look at my glowing white face  It's like holy gym  Yeah yeah  Oh wow  That's what happens  Yeah  That's exactly what happens  It really is  I was annoyed at my own  The camera gets really confused  When it has to take  The photo  It has no idea  What to do  It doesn't know what to do  I'll try this I guess 
[00:36:30]  Alright so Romo's out  Camera gets  They're saying he might be out  For the season  I think he is  I think he's  He's out 8 to 10 weeks  That's pretty much the season  I hate the fucking  I think Wade Phillips is terrible  And I think Romo's a choke  I don't think he's ever  Going to win a big game  Ever  And Favre's record is in jeopardy  I don't believe that injury  Thank you Jimmy  Uh oh  It's so obvious  You don't believe that injury  The NFL wants to suspend Favre  Yeah  But they're probably making a little  Back fucking  Back office deal there 
[00:37:00]  So you think  And they're like  Why don't we just make believe  You have an injury  And then that's why  You have to sit out  But it still fucks his record up  Yes  Yeah but they would rather  Be on his terms  Because of an injury  Than fucking suspending him  For the cock photo  Some fucking  Send your dick  To some fucking chick  And an NFL record  Has stopped  This country  Fucking stinks  That is stupid  And the broad is hurting now  She's lost 9 pounds  And she was in model shape  Before she lost the 9 pounds  So her people are saying 
[00:37:30]  You can only imagine  What that has done to her  Yuck  We met this  We met this broad  And guess what  She's a strong broad  And she can handle a cock picture  This is such horse shit  That's going on  It's bullshit  It's such horse shit  Exactly  The whole world is insane  Maybe she was mad  That his cock was so awful  Yeah  She thought a fucking  An 8 year old  Sent her a cock picture  Well what is she saying  He's got two fractures  Or something  Yeah  In his foot  Or whatever  I wonder if  Honestly  Can you fake something like that  Or is insurance  Would the insurance people 
[00:38:00]  Make you go to their doctor  It might not even be fake  It might be a type of injury  That he could still play  But he's like  Well you do have this injury  It's documented  So why don't you sit out  For that reason instead  Oh by the way  The Giants are just  Breaking quarterbacks this year  I think  Breaking  They are  They're getting to the quarterback  And hurting some  Hurting some QBs this year  Yeah  I think this is the fourth one  To go down  A few have  You know  Got back up  But Romo's out  8 to 10 weeks  And then in Yankee  Bullshit news 
[00:38:30]  Language  I love this  I love this  Complete bullshit  You get  Brian Cashman  Saying that  The GM obviously  They're firing  The pitching coach  They're firing  The pitching coach  But it has  Nothing to do  With what happened  In the playoffs  And just  We don't want  Anyone to think  That that's the reason  We're letting him go  It's so the reason  They're letting him go  How about  What are they going to do  To the hitting coach 
[00:39:00]  With a painting  A quarter of a billion dollars  And he's fucking hideous  He says the ball  Comes at him very fast  Why don't they fire A-Rod  It's very hard  He had a horrendous play  They want the world  They want the home run record  Back in New York  And that's why  That's why they have him  I firmly believe that  A-Rod puts the ass in seats  And is Jeter coming back  Of course  His demands are getting high  What do you mean  What's he want  Anything for him  I don't know exactly  But they're saying  His demands are getting  A little too high  Considering that his numbers  Are going down  They'll pay anything  To keep Jeter  Well Jeter wants his whole career 
[00:39:30]  As a Yankee  That would be pretty cool for him  Because you don't want to see  Jeter in that awkward  Tampa Ray fucking uniform  Or something  Or the Reds  Right  The Padres  We've seen it a million times  The Royals  With those superstars  Padres  I think Walt Frazier  Was a Cavalier at one point  You had Joe Namath  I think he was a L.A. Ram  Right  Yeah  And then he had  What was O.J.  Before he was in Pinstripe  Go ahead, Ann  Huh?  No, you said  What was O.J.?  I said, go ahead, Ann

That's your truck outside isn't it?  Yes it is  Okay  That thing is the biggest truck we've ever seen in the New York area  It's the record right? 
[00:45:00]  I think it's the record for it  We're trying to get into Guinness  It's 430 inches  45 feet long  45 feet long  The Red Giant  It's still a work in progress  Even though it's just about complete  The CB radio is still on the floor  Oh yeah  A couple items  The hydraulics  I don't know if you know  There's two screens on the side  They're 5 by 11 feet  Those screens come out  And they were supposed to lift up to roof height  LED television screens  But they aren't lifting yet  They stay down low  And you got that truck into New York in one piece 
[00:45:30]  Or did you break it down?  Well it took us two days  Two days?  We thought we were finished yesterday  All we could find was low bridges  And nice highways that fit the truck  Except only meant for cars  To get it inside  Yeah  Did you have a problem at the GWB I'm hearing?  Well we had a whole new set of permits  We were going on Frox and Friends here shortly  And we thought we'd blown the show  Because we just couldn't get in  Couldn't get in, yeah  And we got one of the escort services  Brought us in  And everything they decided to hold us over 
[00:46:00]  And everything worked out well  I go crazy just driving an escalator  Around these goddamn streets  I couldn't imagine trying to navigate that thing  Through some of the streets  Well you notice there's a steering axle  Right in the middle, eh?  You're always at it  Well I mean it helps  Yeah, yeah  The truck is so long  If it didn't have the axle in the middle of the truck  You'd be wiping out every corner  Well no, the truck would just bend  It needs that for support  Yeah  So we usually need at least two lanes to turn  Sometimes three  Depending how bad the corner is  Wipe out some pain in the ass pedestrians too  That stand on the corner 
[00:46:30]  Too close to the road  You're not going to get the truck out of here anytime soon then  Because I mean this city is a little busy  Well I mean if the right fellows come to give us a hand  You know Hoboken and Ridgewood  The boys come out with the red lights  And I'll tell you  Oh I see what you're saying  These guys know how to move vehicles  I see  Certainly  You're going to get the special treatment today  Of course  I was hoping to come into Tyne Square with the motorcycle cops helping us out  But they were busy  How is the inside of that cab? 
[00:47:00]  Because I'm always fascinated by tractor trailers  And you look at these tractors  And yours has got to be pretty damn good inside  I don't know if you've heard of Rockwood products  Carl Carson's out of  He makes interiors for  Mainly for Peterbills  But Kenworths  And sometimes custom builds other vehicles  This one has a  Burled Maple 4 in it  Which is the same as the Dash and the Rolls Royce and the Bentley  Oh wow  And he makes special interiors  This is a 1990 Diamond Reel  They stopped building them in about 1991 
[00:47:30]  It's got a 3406B  Four and a quarter cat in it  Only puts about 350 horsepower to the ground  Because it has six drive shafts  Because of the length  You lose a bunch of the power  Yeah, yeah, yeah  But the inside's beautiful  Twist that thing  The whole interior's customized  They used to have a plastic dash in their first built in 1990  And a fellow customized aluminum dash  And it looks just factory in there  It's all molded  Look at  The fellow, Brian Dax  That owns the truck  He's actually put two  The truck has over 2.6 million miles on it  Wow 
[00:48:00]  He drove it since new  And then here just in the last five years  He shut the truck down  Stretched it out  I don't know the names of the custom shops and stuff in Wisconsin  That worked on it  Like the inside's all wooden floor  When those two sides slide out  It's got a computer system  Inner screens, television  Microwave, you know  Bathroom  Like basic is living quarters  We went by a couple  Or we had a couple of tour buses go by us  Like with bands in them  Yeah  And this truck is way cooler than any of the buses 
[00:48:30]  How many did it sleep?  It sleeps one or two?  No, we can sleep six or seven  Wow  Wait, in the tractor?  No, the tractor  We got a double bed  So we try to keep  I keep it down to when I'm married  You know, we got 11 kids and all that stuff  I hate to have my five  Wow  11 kids?  We know what your hobbies are  Wow  Now we know how you're on the road  Wow, yeah  We've been married 38 years  We had sex 13 times  We had two miscarriages  You look like you had it more than I have  Oh my God  11 kids  God bless you  We have 10 grandchildren 
[00:49:00]  It's fertile  10 grandchildren  My oldest grandchild is as old as you guys are  Wow  No  How old are you?  Yeah, you look  You don't look old  We live in North Alaska  I mean, Alaska  The Northwest Territories  You breathe that air and drink that water  I mean, I'm ancient  But I mean, you stay looking  You end up there  Wow  That's a lot of  Fucking  How old do you think he is?  He won't tell us  Now I know that he's got  He says he's got kids  You couldn't have kids as old as we are  But you have  I think he does  Nah, no way 
[00:49:30]  I'm 95  Really  The water and the air up there is just perfect  I mean, it'll keep anything  Preserves you  I'm worried if I stay here more than two days  I'm going to start to sag  Yeah, you probably will  Get out of Dodge, man  Just a little bit  Now, you'd been driving a truck up there for years  What did you think when you were approached  To do a TV show  Based on this?  Was it kind of like  What are you talking about?  This is just my job  No  The good Lord puts different things in one's path every day 
[00:50:00]  And you have to make a decision  Yes or no  And then down the road  Sometimes it's the wrong decision  You'll have to do something different  And you just make choices every day  They come up  I was doing my job  We've seen lots of cameras on the road  European, German, English, Asian  American cameras  Because people are interested in the north  Like we're out  You know, the places that you spend  Six, seven thousand  I don't know  Ten thousand dollars  To go fishing up there  Well, we drive on those lakes  And we think  Yeah  We'd like to come fishing in the summer  Except we'd have to hire a plane 
[00:50:30]  And everything else to get in there  And so a lot of people find it interesting  These guys come up  And we see them on the road  And I've thought about  It'd be kind of interesting  To be on a documentary or whatever  Mm-hmm  And then they showed up  And decided to make a show  And they went looking for characters  And the folks in town  All pointed in my direction  And said  Oh, is that it?  Yeah  You know, if you need a character  Go see Devogorsky  Because, you know, I've done a number of things  Sometimes life can be boring  You know, I ran for mayor one time  People are saying  Well, what do you run for mayor for?  I said, well, I need teeth  So I didn't get elected  So just in case you're wondering 
[00:51:00]  I still need teeth  As a matter of fact  The other day I ran into a lady  And she was saying  I'm going to get a new set of teeth  I said, well, have you got a mouth  As big as mine  And maybe I can get your old ones  What's wrong with your teeth?  They look fine  Well, I just  But you're on the side  The good side  Oh, see  I've got a couple  I miss him  Oh, my God  He's going to kill us  Yeah  That really is  That's the sound you hear  As a shallow grave is being dug  All you see is the moonlight  Is that  Somebody's trying to poison me? 
[00:51:30]  No, I think  Is this one yours?  What's in here?  Oh, jeez  Can't we keep this straight?  This one here's got milk in it  And it's  This might be yours, sir  I didn't touch it  This is mine right here  Yeah, positive  Well, why were you licking  A little hole in top of the cup?  That's just what I do  It reminds me of a hiney  Jesus  I thought maybe he thought  It was an ant  Going to come out or something  So  We should be promoting the book, sir  Right, right  You're going to book about your life, right?  Yes  My memoir  Yeah, King of the Road  King of the Road 
[00:52:00]  Do you know who sang King of the Road?  1964 song  Horton?  No  Roger Miller  Roger  Yeah, Roger Miller  That's right, yeah  King of the Road  Good oldie  Good oldie  I should remember that  Yeah, I know, right?  That's all right  It's the name of the book  Dang  That was that guy, too  But the one I could never figure  James, James  Hold the ladder steady  I'm a-coming down into your arms  I'm a-coming down into your arms  Nobody tell me who wrote that song 
[00:52:30]  I have no idea  I'm the only guy that ever heard it  Out in the woods, you know, that's where we lived  We didn't even have power  We could probably find out for you if you need to  There's a lot of trucking songs  What's that one?  Six Days on the Road and I'm Gonna Make It Home Tonight  And, uh, Convoy  That one I know  But there aren't  He's pounding down  There aren't very many trucking shows  No  And that's what  Well, do you got the satellite?  We got some great trucking shows now  Trucking shows as far as on television  Yeah  As far as shows about truck drivers  Like Ice Road Truckers, eh?  Right  Yeah  You don't want to 
[00:53:00]  They picked a very treacherous area  That would be interesting for, uh, for truckers  Um, now, now  How long have you been driving up there?  Well, I've lived up there 35 years  And you've been driving  Just driving on ice the whole time  Since about the 80s  I have a business of my own  I just drive in the wintertime  Up north in the bush on the ice  Mm-hmm  And in the summertime  I dig, make topsoil  And, you know, dig holes  All gravel  I've got  I've got  I understand that  You're  How many addictions do you have? 
[00:53:30]  Oh, God, plenty  Cars?  Yeah  I like cars  Yeah, I have  I've got 150 in my front yard  People think I have  They think I have  I have a junkyard  It's a collection  I do have a couple of drag lines  And maybe a half dozen  Eight big trucks, yeah  Are you a hoarder?  They all run  I got sheds full  I don't consider  I'm a collector  That's what they say  I'm not a hoarder  I'm a collector  Only people that collect  Understand people that collect  What the reason is  You don't even know  How to verbalize it  But I understand  Your problem  I can see a crossover show 
[00:54:00]  Yeah  I throw truckers and hoarders  Hoarders can't  Hoarders can't verbalize it either  So why do you need that?  Ah  It's a feeling  They just know  You can say in danger though  You know, really  Driving truck  There's 40,000 Americans a year  Die on the highways of America  It's 120 a day  That's more than all the NATO troops  American troops  Canadian troops  German, Polish  All the guys from Afghanistan  Iraq and all over the place  It's dangerous out there  And the guys out there  Right, they're basically in a war zone  Yeah  And you know, every day  You know, things happen 
[00:54:30]  And you drop your phone  Look down  You've got a problem  Half the time  Everybody scares the pants  Themself once a day  You know  But what happens  A lot of guys  I'll talk to guys  I don't do that  Dangerous shit  You know  And the guys  I said, you forgot  Because you know  You start out  You get your load  You tie it down  You go down the road  You have all the worries  Of making sure it doesn't fall off  You deliver it  And once it's in the bank  You have a beer  You forget about it  Because the next load  You're working on  You're thinking about that  You just totally  Totally forget about the last one  And then they just don't remember  You know  You're looking forward 
[00:55:00]  Rather than backwards  Sure  I mean, I've seen a couple places  On, you know  Where it showed me  Sliding down the hill  In the show  And I thought  Where the heck did they get that from  And that's only a couple of months ago  Like, I didn't do that  I didn't do that  I thought they were scripting  Or something  And then I saw the show  I figured, oh  That was bad  I remember now  Oh, because you just  Put it out of your mind  Once it's done  It's like, yeah  We slid  I slid again  You know  Well, no  At the time  It's bothersome  I mean, that's why  I had to have a hemorrhoid operation  And the darn thing's come back  You know  Oh, shit  That's a trucker's worst thing 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, that's really bad  You know  A medical situation  You have to sit on it  Oh, shit, man  Yeah, man  Jesus  A lot of people call me that  But I'm not him  I'm sorry  Yeah, yeah  I hear you  Do you guys have  In the thing  I always wanted to  Because you see in truck stops  You have a little  What kind of bathroom 
[00:56:00]  Do you have  What do you shit  Like, do you guys  Have like a little  Can you shit  What do you think  They make ditches for  Oh, you have to get out  They're shitting  And burying hookers  See, he shits outside  Like a real man  I mean, that's something  People don't think about  Especially out  In the winter roads  You know  We've got an 8 hour drive  At 15 miles an hour  If we're coming out of  Yellowknife  To get to Lockhart  Like, where do you go  To the bathroom  Like, every self-respecting truck  Or at least once  Every once in a while  Poops his pants  Has to just  I mean, it's just like  Nobody talks about it 
[00:56:30]  Because, you know  You're in traffic  You're here  You're there  You drank too much coffee  You know  Maybe caught the flu  You know, not eating  The right food  The stomach is  At least I've got problems  If I don't eat regular  And I don't eat the right foods  The next thing  I've got a problem  You know  And whatever goes in  Has got to come out  So, sometime it doesn't do it  According to plan  Well, they don't show that  On the show  That'd be a great show  Oh, yeah  That'd be a great episode  That'd be like the DVD  All the different places  That different individuals  Just accidentally pooped themselves  Yeah, that'd be a show  That could be a whole episode 
[00:57:00]  That could be a whole episode  So, you guys have like  Do you have like  A little portable thing  Like if you have an emergency  And you just got to pull over  You don't have like  A little portable thing  Well, some of the guys do  I don't  But there's people  Let's stick it over the railing  You think the first  Pants-shitting episode  Would say, you know what  I've got to get a portable thing here  So this never happens again  I mean, up north there  I've only got so many  Like I'm carrying  With my own truck  I'm carrying a lot of tools  I'm carrying parts with me  I've got just enough room  You know, from my seat  Into back to sleep  I mean, I met an old guy  And he was a gold miner  Prospector from the Klondike 
[00:57:30]  From Alaska  Up in that way  And we were hauling up there  And he had a great big  He had one last  What do you call  The big V8 cats  In his truck  And in his sleeper  It was just like a hole  It was a big dip  It was just right  From the ceiling  Down the floor  And I don't know  Just like a cave in there  And he'd just crawl in  Sort of lay in his dip  Of clothes and parts  And I looked at his dash  And the middle of his dash  Was burnt  It was melted  And I was thinking  Like, what happened  To your dash?  And he says  Oh, he says  My heater quit  And I'm using a tiger torch  And the tiger torch  That's the flame thrower  You know, the propane bottle 
[00:58:00]  And I looked  And I looked  And here's the propane bottle  Like for your barbecue  Sitting beside a seat  The tiger torch  Is balanced on top  And rolling back and forth  He didn't have it on  And he said  I was going down the road  And he said  The dash caught fire  The torch fell off the bottle  I hit a pothole  I was trying to get the torch  Turned off  Inside his truck's on fire  He's burning  Like he must have been  Really gassed, you know  From the melting plastic  And, you know, checking out  Yeah, you would think  But burning bifennels  And everything out there  God damn, wow  Wow  That's some crazy shit 
[00:58:30]  There's some surreal characters  Up there still  They haven't all died off yet  How about the lot lizards?  Do you have those lot lizards  Up there?  Those girls  What's the lot lizards?  Truckers always tell us  About the girls  Who are in the truck stops  The ugly hookers  Who come at like  Three o'clock in the morning  And like wrap on the side  Of your truck  Well, up there  It's where the men are men  And the huskies are scared  Oh  It's got to be  A little too cold  Right?  Yeah  I've seen a few episodes  Where guys are driving  And you'll hear a noise  And be like  Uh-oh  I've got to get out 
[00:59:00]  And the bundling up  Of getting out  What's the temperature?  Well, I mean  It's like you guys  You're all sitting  What are you?  Commander?  What do you call it  Down here or something?  You guys don't have underwear on  I have underwear  Up north you wear underwear  I mean, I had them with me  I had them on the other day  In Hoboken  The wind was blowing  It was really cool  You know where  It's like light t-shirt material  But it's full body  Full body, right  That's like  That's for the fall  And then you go heavier  And heavier  And the winter comes  I mean, you're walking  Around your shirt sometime  You look like you've got  Nothing on  You're really tough  But really you've got  Long johns on  And they're keeping you warm  What kind of temperatures  Are you dressed for? 
[00:59:30]  You put one balaclava on  If the wind starts howling  Starts hitting  You know, 60, 70, 80, 100 below  You put a second balaclava on  To cut the wind  100 below  You know, you've got a snow machine  Suit over top  Your clothes  Which are over top  Of your long johns  You've got all these layers  On there  It's comfort  Like 45 below  Until it's fantastic  The air is crisp and clean  At night  The northern lights  You see them  You can actually hear them  You can hear them crackle  Just from the cold  They change  It's fantastic  And even in the big storms  It's blowing  It's 100 below  It's neat to be out there  As long as you're dressed for it 
[01:00:00]  If you're not dressed for it  You're only going to  Well, what happens  Is when hypothermia  Starts setting in  And you really get cold  You start feeling hot  Even though you're freezing  And a lot of guys  You'll find them  Frozen in the snow banks  They start taking your clothes off  Until you're naked  And you feel so hot  And you're basically  It's the exact opposite  Because of the way  The brain works  Yeah  And there you are  Running through the snow banks  And  The biggest nightmare thing  You know if the wolves  Don't drag you away  Or the coyotes  Or the wolverines  Or the poor bear  Yeah, they might find you  100 below  Space is like 300 below  Space  That's how cold space is, right? 
[01:00:30]  It's like 300 degrees below  Zero, I think  It's almost space  Yeah  You're a third of the way  To space  You have to eat  A tablespoon of  Maple leaf lard  Every morning  Yeah  And also  That's a natural way  Of getting rid of wrinkles  You just have  A tablespoon of lard  Every morning  Until the wrinkles disappear  You don't have to use Botox  Wait, you eat it?  It's naturopathic  Oh boy, Jimmy's going to  Go find some good stuff now  Because you don't have  Many wrinkles  Because you're a little heavier  So as you fill out  The wrinkles disappear  I'm the funniest guy 
[01:01:00]  I know  He's the funniest guy  He knows  Take every opportunity again  I'll have to one of my jokes  I love Alex  I gotta read your book now  Do you love me?  Well, not in that way  I'm taking donations  Anything over 20  Because I can't count under 20 
[01:01:30]  Buy a new set of teeth  Buy some clothes for the kids  We haven't even talked about  Your book and you sold me  I gotta now  Just listen to you  I gotta read this book  King of the Road now  I just have to  It's my memoir  True Tales from a Legendary  Ice Road Tracker  There's always things  Happening around me  Ever since I was young  Not always good things  When it's 40, 50  And well you even said  100 degrees below  And you're dressed for it  But aren't you nervous  That if something happens  To your rig  Now you're out there  In the elements  Well the problem is 
[01:02:00]  Is we live there  That's what I would be  Freaked out about  One of the problems  Is that some guys  Do freeze to death  Not dressed properly  People that live there  Because you take it  When you live there  You take it for granted  You get in your car  You drive your truck  Things always run  A lot of people  Most people don't go prepared  I tend to  When I go on the road  I've got lots of stuff  I have no room in the truck  Because I've got tools  And I've got parts  I carry tow  I've got a big tow rope  You don't be surprised  Like a lot of people  They don't have this stuff  I can pull other trucks  Out of the ditch  Especially if I'm loaded  And dressed for it  A lot of people  You get used to everything running 
[01:02:30]  You get used to the worm  And then all of a sudden  Something happens  And you're stuck  And that's where the problem  Because you're used to it  You don't prepare  You'd be surprised  How little northerners  That live in that stuff  Don't prepare  Take it for granted  Aboriginal people and stuff  They just take it for granted  They're traveling on the land  They're not geared up good enough  And then something happens  You know  A bunch of coincidences  The machine breaks down  The guy that said  He's going to meet you  Didn't show up  You know  Maybe you go through the ice  Or go into overflow  And get wet on top of all  What's going through overflow  And your mattress overflows  When we're on the ice 
[01:03:00]  A lot of times  As the lake settles  You know  As the snow builds up  The ice will  It'll push like the whole lake  I mean anything on that ice  Is creating weight  When you've got a whole lake  And it's got a foot of snow  Or two feet of snow  Maybe the weather warmed up  Maybe it rained a bit  Makes that  It's pushing the ice down  And then the ice pushes down  And then you get some water  And the whole layer of water  Comes on top  Rising  The first time you saw that  Did you think you were drowning  Or you were about to go  Through the fucking lake  We do have on occasion  For instance  There was a time  When there was overflow  And it's only  We know that there's  At that point there  We knew that there was 
[01:03:30]  A stream that was flowing  In that area  Or a river  That was potentially  Crossing the road  So you're not sure  If it wore the road  Because ice will not stay  Like ice might be  Three feet thick  But it doesn't stay  Three feet thick  It gets thicker  But sometimes it gets thinner  As you drive on it  Or there's currents  It'll wear out  So it might get thinner  In it  Depending on what  The currents are doing  And it was a great big  There was lots of overflow  There was fairly deep  So I turned the track  The truck around  Put the chains on  All four wheels in the back  And then hung  Well the first time  I learnt the hardwigs  The first time I did this  Left the mud flaps down 
[01:04:00]  But tie your mud flaps up  And back the mud  Mud flap end of the truck  The back end of the truck  Into the overflow  And break ice with the trailer  Oh shit  And then so that  If it's going to sink  The trailer would go down  Yeah right right  The trailer's going to go first  Back the truck through  The chains give you traction  Because you don't want to get  Inside that overflow  Like two feet of water  At 25 below  And all of a sudden  Here you spin out  And you've got to go  And stand in this water  And lay down  Or try to get chains on  So you make your chairs  Get chains on  Back through  And bust all the ice  With the trailer 
[01:04:30]  Which the boss  Probably doesn't like to see  But he does want to  Get the load there  Like the first time  Took the mud flaps off  Because I left the mud flaps down  Because the ice in the top  Why turn it off?  Well because when the truck  Goes through  And it breaks the ice  Well all of a sudden  The mud flaps are hanging  In the water  And the tires are pushing  The mud flaps against the ice  Turning  And they rip the mud flaps off  And they get excited about that  I mean I'm not going  To worry about the truck  I own the truck  But the guy owns the trailer  When you bring the trailer back 
[01:05:00]  And there's parts missing off  Yeah they get a little mad  Like when you do your pre-trip  You put down missing mud flaps  Before you start the trip  Would you wait until  After the trip?  Yeah  You know  A banged up reefer  Well that  You know my truck  Is a little short  So the reefer's probably  Going to hit the headache  Or actually do the pre-trip  The reefer's banged up  You pre-brake it  On the paperwork  I pre-broke it  On the paperwork  Yeah  Little tricks of the trade  Whoops  Anyway  Whoops  So you back it onto the lake  To make sure  Well I mean  We're on the lake 
[01:05:30]  And all of a sudden  There's an area of water  On the lake  In the middle of winter  And you know  You figure it's okay  But then what happens  Along comes my buddy  Roman behind me  My bumper's higher  And he's got a Texas bumper  And it's down  To about this high  Off the ground  And he comes through  It frontwards  Even you know  The way after I got  Back the trailer  Bust all the ice  Turn around  Turn the trailer around  Drive through forwards  It was bumper solo  It's too bad  I didn't have a can  He picked all that ice  All that broken ice  He was picking it up  With the bumper  Because his bumper's  Underwater  Like a plow yeah  And he's got a  89 
[01:06:00]  He had an  89 international  And the ice just built  Right up his grill  So it was literally  Getting ready to come  Right over  And he'd come out  Of that hole of ice  Or it was actually  Ready to go on top  Of his hood  He knocked a bunch  Of lights off  And things like that  I couldn't believe it  Holy mackerel  You're pushing that  Whole wall of ice  With your grill  Oh wait a minute  There's  Hold on  I didn't understand  So you got the ice  There's a river  Through the ice  There's a river  Underneath the ice  In some places  There's currents  Under the ice  Because in the lake  There might be a river  Entering the lake  And leaving the lake  On the opposite end  Of the lake  Or crossways 
[01:06:30]  And then you've got  Ice over top  So there's a current  Running that way  And then somehow  The water gets up  On top of the ice  Maybe it froze down  To the bottom  Sometimes we end up  With only  Because of pressures  There's springs  Out in the swamp  And all the water  Will start coming up  And just start  How come you don't  Go through the fucking  Ice completely  Into the water below  Because the ice below  Was heavy enough  To carry me  And it was only  This much of the ice  Was bad on top  Maybe he's doing  Like 9, 10 inches  Or a foot  And how thick is ice  For you to be able  To drive a truck  Like that on  It has to be  Well I mean  When you start 
[01:07:00]  Building it  It's one thing  There's the guys  That build the ice  There's guys  That have to go out  And prep and make it  They've got to  Take the snow off it  Initially  Okay we're going  To have an ice road  So now they get out  There into November  And beginning December  And somebody's got to  Go out there  And measure it  Okay we're going  To take a snow machine  With these  Either with ice augers  Which is a manual  Old fashioned way  Or they go out  And they have  This electronic gadget  That's got radar  It looks through the ice  It's okay  We can get a  Now we can get a  Machine of the plow  On those snow groomers  You know the big  Wide tracks  With a little  Ground pressure  With the big blade  And then they move 
[01:07:30]  The snow off  The snow is an  Insulating factor  So when they get  About 16, 18 inches  Of ice  It depends on who it is  And how adventuresome  They are  And who's watching  Them do it  They'll get out there  And knock the snow off  And then they'll start  Moving  As you move back and forth  The ice you start  Driving the frost  And you take the  Insulating blanket  Of snow off  And then the weather  Itself starts freezing  And then the water  Trucks come onto it  And start watering it  And then we've got  Portages  Between every lake  Every two lakes  There's land  And it's called  The portage  So we cross the land  So then up on the  Portages  They're full of holes  And everything 
[01:08:00]  They don't go there  And level them all out  You know  You can't reach them  In the summertime  When the ground's  Thawed out  So now you come up  And you mix  You take a mixture  Of snow and water  And water trucks  And graders  And you fill all the holes  And you smooth it over  And so you get  Like a highway in between  And down to the next lake  Plow the snow off  They prep the road  So those guys  They're 15, 20  They're probably  Around 20 inches  I've been in 18, 20 inches  Of water truck  You know  Where I have to load water  Got a hole in the ice  I'm loading water  Half asleep  And out there  A little bit longer  Than I should be  And you know  As you're pumping water  Into the truck  The truck is getting heavier 
[01:08:30]  And you're sitting on the ice  And they suddenly realize  That the water's  Kind of coming out of the hole  Halfway up my shoe  And I'm thinking  What the heck  You know  I think I've got enough water  Getting out of here  And go dump your load  Half a load of course  But then when we  They take us on there  I think it's 28 to 32 inches  Of ice  When you get the first loads  They take light loads  5,000 pounds  In a tractor trailer  Like in a van  Toilet paper  Insulation  Whatever  You know  Because they need  Everything up there  You've got 600 men  Prudhoe Bay  You've got 14,000 men  And women up there  So they need everything  From toilet paper  To heavy equipment parts 
[01:09:00]  To send the light loads  And then the first day  Maybe three trucks  Go out like  You know  North of the Yellowknife  And then maybe  6, 10  By the 15th  You're running 100  150, 200  You know  By the end of the month  You're running all 800 trucks  You're starting to  800 trucks  On a real big year  12,000 load year  That sometime  They'll have  Somewhere between Edmonton  Which is a  You know  A thousand miles south of us  And up there in the mines  There's 800 trucks  Going round and round  Trying to move the equipment  Well I could say  Between us and Houston  I mean there's  Lots of times  Look  A bunch of stuff  Come out  All the way up  Down the western seaboard 
[01:09:30]  Might even come out  Of New York  It was especially equipment  British Columbia  It comes from all over the place  Actually all over the world  Some of the equipment  Wow  How do you talk about  They went out there  In the barren lands  Not a tree in sight  In the middle of nowhere  Spent one and a half billion  Over one and a half billion dollars  For a couple of those mines  To build a mine  I thought like  What the heck  Just put the money in the bank  And collect the interest  Any interest  Like anything  Could be a lot of money  Building a mine up there  Went out and built  In the middle of nowhere  How do you put  I want to know how he puts  How do you put chains  On a tire  Like you have to do that 
[01:10:00]  In a hundred degree  Below  When the wind's blowing stuff  Yeah if you've got a problem  And you're going to spin out  You've got to put them on  You take the chains off  You throw them over the tire  How long does that take  Well it depends  How old, tired, sick  How messed up you are  Put them on  You know  I mean  Usually it's not a race  Are we talking about  My chaining up abilities  No  I have no concept  I've been picked up  Don't mess with that  Jimmy  I have no  But I have no  He lives a man's life 
[01:10:30]  Like what do you do  In the summer  I have soil  It's just man stuff  Like soil and gravel  That's the interesting thing  You bring it up  I'm really concerned right now  I've gone back  To eating with my hands  Of course all you guys know  That eating with utensils  Only came to men  Maybe in the late 1800s  And women are the only ones  That ate with utensils  Yeah  With women's labor  We both eat with our hands now  But what happened here lately  I always ate with utensils  Until I started to tweet  This Twitter tweeting  Like it's so unmasculine  How unmasculine can that be 
[01:11:00]  I tweet  So I thought just to make up for it  I went back to eating with my hands  Yeah to balance out  Balance out the queerness  People come along  And think I'm getting too feminine  He's got grease stuff  Running down on his shirt  Who are you on Twitter  Because we can get you  Some followers today  Who am I  Oh you don't even know  Ice Road Alex  Ice Road Alex  Ice Road Alex  Okay  So wait  Is chaining up the tire  Does it take an hour  To do the whole thing  Or is that 20 minutes  Well it depends  On the situation  Usually you're only  Chaining up one axle 
[01:11:30]  So just  Two sets of  Triples  You know  Triples are that  Cover both tires  And  Could be anywhere  From 10 minutes  To 25 minutes  If  Depends  The back  Your back is really  Killing you  Maybe even a little longer  You know  Sometimes your back's  Balling you  And you know  The hemorrhoids  And everything else  You're kind of having trouble  I saw a guy  His brakes  Locked up on him  His brakes locked up  And he had to get a torch  And he's sitting out there  Just banging with a hammer  And a torch 
[01:12:00]  And to me  It looked like  The worst night  You could spend  Doing anything  It was just  It gets worse than that  Freezing cold  You're under there  At 40 below  There was one of your  Dump valve valves  And you're underneath  The trailer  And you're heating that  And you're turning up  Your torch  And you melt  The plastic airlines off  And now you've got to  Fix the airline  And then worry about  The thing  And they just  So you melted  The actual truck  Up there in Alaska  We've got Lisa Kelly  I don't know if any of you  Know who Lisa Kelly  Oh yeah yeah yeah  You guys just  Watch the guys  She's a hottie  Oh you do watch the girls too 
[01:12:30]  Oh yeah yeah yeah  The guys in New York  Maybe were normal  I don't  I mean I heard so many  Terrible things  You know about New York  Oh no no  We like women  Is this your first time  In New York  Might as well say that  Might as well  I was here once before  They just put me  By Central Park  There in the stall  With the horses  They put me down  With the horses  Yeah it wasn't bad  They put me in a hotel  You guys live pretty good here  That ain't bad  I don't know who's paying  For the hotel  Pretty nice hotel 
[01:13:00]  Probably history shall  Hopefully  Hopefully they don't  Chase me down the street  As I head west  Alex you got a lot  Of fans calling in here  They want to ask  About India  So anyway the whole  Thing of having Lisa  There in chains  You can always get  Lisa to help you out  She actually volunteered  To help me out  One time  She's pretty good  With the chains  I know  She knows her stuff  The chains weigh more  Than she does  So there's a math problem  I saw the episode too  Where she had to  Help  I never knew this was done  Up the hills  With a heavy load  Gotta take two trucks 
[01:13:30]  A push truck  A push truck  These push trucks  Coming right into New York  Here when they're  Bringing big loads  With all these axles  Yeah  Like this pilot car guy  That's high  Wide and heavy  That brought us  And he was telling us  They bring these huge loads  Like axle after axle  After axle  And it's so heavy  That you need a push truck  To push it on flat ground  Let alone push it up  Wow  Really  Like they brought  One of those boring machines  That you guys make  Your tunnels  For your subway stuff  And they brought one  Down here and unloaded it  In the middle of the night  A boring machine  We call that Eric 
[01:14:00]  There it is  Sorry Eric  Because I was like that  That's like Carl Carson  He'd be sitting there  You could hear him  Purring in the corner  He's snoring  Is that what you mean  By boring  A boring machine  Yeah that seems to me  To be a pretty difficult  Maneuver there  To get your bumper  Right up against  The trailer  Or the other truck  And now you can't see  Anything in front of you  You completely are  Depending on  The trucker in front  You're flying by instruments  And you depend on them  You're not supposed 
[01:14:30]  To touch the steering wheel  Yeah yeah  You take your hands  Off the steering wheel  And it's odd  Because when the lead truck  Is turning  Your truck will actually  Turn with it  So this is to do what?  To push another truck  Up a hill  Because it doesn't have  Under it's own power  It can't get such a heavy load  Up some of these icy hills  It's a push truck  And then they go  Around the front  A lot of times  If there's a steep hill  And use their brakes  To stop it  And kind of slow them down  Can I finish  Do you guys  Any more to eat here?  Yeah really  It's a man  I'm just kidding  It's a man 
[01:15:00]  He eats a lot  You think he's going to have  Some of that  Faggy yogurt  That Opie eats  I hit my yogurt  I'm not stupid  I'm not stupid  I ate some stuff  Called tofu  The other day  Tofu  What was it?  It's shit  It's terrible  It's awful  Yeah styrofoam  Is it little white squares?  It's made out of like soy  There's no taste to it  That's awful  It's horrible  I think they put  A little bit of diesel  On it or something  Diesel 
[01:15:30]  Yeah I think a lot of  Vegetarians use it  And they season it  And say  No it tastes just like  A hamburger  If you cook it right  I think no it doesn't  Some of that hand lotion  I've used  Tastes just like that  You put it in your mouth  Softens your skin  Smells like a woman  Holy shit  So king of the road  Hold on  I want to ask you  The big buck  I just want to plug it  Who's in charge here anyway?  No one  No one  It's anarchy  Okay I'll be in charge  It's anarchy 
[01:16:00]  You don't want to talk  About India?  Is that what it is?  Because you kind of  Ignore it  Well you know  I didn't want to go  And I kind of  Didn't want to go back  And things went  A little sideways for me  Yeah  Because a lot of people  Want to ask about India  Okay  Ask me a question about India  Okay good enough  I'm feeling brave  Wait did you go  I knew there was  Something there  Because you want  To ignore that question  We went to India  Lisa and I  And Rick with blue hair  And then they replaced me  With a young fella  From Alabama  Okay  Because I left  Is this a bad topic? 
[01:16:30]  Well I'm a little bit  Sensitive about it  Because I don't want  To be choked out  By the end of this interview  Give me three choices  I'll take the other two  Wait do we have colors?  Oh yeah  Chad  You have to put your headphones  Chad in California  Hold on Chad  Hold on he's putting  His headphones on  So we can hear you  Where do I put them?

Of course  We're good at everything  We were blessed with  Good at everything  Good genes  You know  Well they're good  At getting in trouble too  Remember  That's the problem  Now where do you  It's just something  About coming from  That area  That makes you  Like I guess  Healthier  Strong  Men  Yeah you have to 
[01:18:30]  You're a real man  You have to know  How to deal with  Soil and stuff  Because you could die  We never have  I'm going to die  Weather here  We have like  Oh it's cold  And we run in  We bitch a little bit  I thought I seen  On TV  At a tornado  Once right here  On the parkway  Yeah that was recently  That was once  That was once  They lose their mind  Everybody freaks out  About it  That's top of  Mount Everest temperature  Well the fellow  Had lost his wife  Probably wasn't  Very happy  Right right right  Yeah but I was  Almost late for the airport  Because of that  Not to minimize his loss  You were really upset  You just blew the horn  The whole way 
[01:19:00]  I really did not  Have it well  Your finger hasn't recovered  That's why I've got  A cast on your middle finger  Because  No that's not why  I wish that was why  Hey Alex  Where do you guys  Call home  How far up is it  Well my home  Is in Curtis  We're in Yellowknife  Northwest territories  On the north shore  Of Great Slave Lake  We've got three territories  We've got a number  Of provinces  Three territories  Across the top  So you've got Alaska  Which is America  And then the east Alaska  The Yukon Territory  Which is about  23,000 people  Then the northwest territories  Which is twice the size 
[01:19:30]  Of Texas  But we only have  40,000 people  Half of us are aboriginal  You know  Indian people  And some Inuit people there  And then you move  Farther east  It's called Nunavut  And it's mainly  All Inuit people  Or Eskimo people  And you know  When they split the territory  They made it  Northwest territories  And Nunavut  We used to say  Nunavut  And we're the rest of it  40,000 people  In an area  That big  Wow  Well Canada  Only has 35 million  Roughly  Which is a population  Of the area  Of Mexico City  Or Mumbai  And it's mostly 
[01:20:00]  On the border  And it's huge  Point to where you live  Just so we can have  We're looking at a map  Oh you're looking there  It says  I think it says  A  A  See A  That's where you live  That's the lake  That's the yellow knife  That's the lake  Yep  There you got her  Wow  Wow  That's up there  If you keep going  You're going to see my house  Well you're probably  On Google  You'll probably be able  To find it  Couldn't you  What's going up there  I know  Who the hell's going up there  Doesn't matter  Did he get it  Yeah I got it  He wasn't paying attention  I got it 
[01:20:30]  Iraq  Did he get that  I got it  It's fine  What are you guys doing now  Somebody trying to get in  You don't want to give your address  We didn't want that to go over the air  You don't want to give your address out  Whoops  That's alright  He's begging  He's begging for someone  To knock out his door  Yeah he hasn't seen a person  In years  We've got people  From all over the world  How many people  From Italy, Germany  How many people  In your town Alex  Roughly 20,000  20,000 people  A movie theater  Half the half  Of the population  Of the Northwest Territory  Oh 
[01:21:00]  We're the highest  Income per capita  Highest education  Per capita  And the youngest population  Per capita  Of any city in Canada  Even though we're small  Right  So we've got  We've got  You know  And we pretty well got it  We're probably  One of the most  Traveled  And cosmopolitan cities  Like everybody goes  Everywhere  It's probably one of the most  Connected cities  Like if you're connected  In New York  Then I mean  Just to get to your connection  You've got a long way to go  And we only have  20,000 people  And you're connected  It's easy  You jump on the plane  There's not a big airport  There's not 
[01:21:30]  You know  So people  In the old days  When I drove taxi  Back 35 years ago  They'd fly  Two 737s in  And we spent  Half the night  Loading people on them  And they'd go  Right from Yellowknight  To Hawaii  Like the whole  Half the town  Leave to go  To Hawaii together  It'd be a big bash  On the plane  Like a lot of them  Didn't remember  Where they were  They just  All they remember  Is getting on a plane  Getting carried off  You drove a taxi  Up there  Wow  I've done lots of stuff  Security bouncing  Taxi  Heavy equipment  It's all in the book  Huh  There's a good bit of it 
[01:22:00]  The book  The book is mainly  My memoirs  A bit about the family  Coming from Europe  The carrying on  I mean  Trying to get my cousin  Wife's cousin  To put his arm  We tried to do a family  Portrait one time  With a bear  We had a female bear  And a cub  Out in one of the parks  And I tried to  I talked Fred into  Going over  And trying to get  The bear to stand up  Put his arm around  The bear's shoulder  So he could have  Mum and dad  And a cub  Fred used to have  A beard and long hair  And I thought  They looked  Kind of  Looked a lot alike  And then when  He went to grab  The bear  Bananas  And I was so busy 
[01:22:30]  Yelling for him  To hang on  To the bear  I never really got  Much of a picture  I was laughing so hard  To get a picture  Of a lot of stuff  Instead of Fred the bear  That's what fucking men  Do to joke around  With the bear  Jimmy shows his asshole  It's the same thing  Like what that  None of you guys  Been bit by a bear  No  I can't say  I shot my first bear  When I was 13  And the first shot  Went right through  His back legs  And right through  His balls  And then I had to  Go track him 
[01:23:00]  In the bush  And I did it wrong  I didn't know enough  I had a 303  Lee Enfield  And I had savage cells  In it  Which you do not do  Because they can  Explode in the chamber  And I only had two  But anyway  The bear  I ended up  Cutting and wrapping  And putting them  In the deep trees  And old fat newton  That lived back in the bush  Gave me 35 bucks  Which is a lot  About a hundred and some dollars  Because that was back in 60  Yeah different  Back in the 60s  1860s or 1960s  I can't really remember  So you shot the bear  Through the balls  You don't play games  No I didn't mean to  I realized that  When I skinned him  Because he didn't  He just took off 
[01:23:30]  You know  And look at your trucks  On TV right there  There it is  There we are  Are you doing an interview  Over there  Are we holding you back  Oh Meadowlark  Yeah isn't that  Meadowlark 11's out there  Five more minutes  We got with him  Two 5x11 television screens  On either side  That's $760,000  And counting  The guy like  I mean  You don't think  We're really broke  We're really broke  We find places  To put money  That are really important  Alex are you  Are you ever  That's why I've got no teeth  Are you ever scared  Of animals  Being way up there  I'm scared 
[01:24:00]  I'm scared of the dark too  But I go out there  Yeah  I'm scared of lots of stuff  What kind of animals  You got to look out for  When you're living up  In that area  Obviously the bears  Well like if you find  A wolverine in your pants  And you go to put them on  In the morning  You don't  Just let them have the pants  You're going to work  Without pants  I mean you just don't  Don't go near them  Everyone will say  Hey you must have  A wolverine in his pants  That's why he's got no pants  That's a better answer  Better  Yes  You have wolverines  Up there or no  There's wolverines 
[01:24:30]  You got  The lynx  Of course the wolves  Moose and buffalo  And bear  Black bear  Get a little bit farther north  Bear land  Grizzly  You get into Alaska  Well they got the big  Kodiaks and stuff there  I mean you just about  Well barely get through the door  You a big hunter  You like  I've got guns  I used to hunt  I don't hunt  I made a deal with the fish  I said you leave me alone  I leave you alone  I mean I drive on the ice  Oh yeah yeah  No problem  No revenge  I'm not  It just costs a lot of money and time 
[01:25:00]  You know you get 11 kids  I mean the kids are growing up  The oldest is 38  The youngest one is 11  But we still have three at home  We have grandkids in the basement  You know so  You're busy trying to provide  And like it's really easy  To go to the grocery store  And you know really  Just pick something up  The wild meats  Well I bet  Yeah we just buy something  That's full of  Full of all the different  Chemicals  And you know  Other things that are  In some of the meat  We buy today  And we just eat that  Yeah  God Alex you roll man  That's a hell of a life man  Yeah let's plug the book  Fantastic  Yeah yeah 
[01:25:30]  It's called King of the Road  How do you say  How do you say your last name  I keep saying it wrong  Well it was Smith  And my dad was coming  Over in a boat from Europe  And he wanted a name  With a little more punch  So he changed it to  Dabagorski  Wow really  It's phonetic  Anybody up to grade 3  Anybody up to grade 3  Can say it  And after that  They just get all  Kefuffled  It says bear hunting  Drag racing  You did a little drag racing  In your day  Yeah  Kind of out in the bush  On the dirt  I don't know what you call  That kind of racing  I think there's a name for it 
[01:26:00]  I can't think of  Illegal  I was looking for a different word  Yeah sure  Cattle rustling  That's good  Gold prospecting  Yeah it wasn't me  I was just  I was younger  I was younger than 12  And it doesn't count  I wasn't to  I wasn't to the age  You reasoned  I understand  I understand  That's a lot of  Sounds like you got  A lot of fun memories  Though  You've done a lot of things  That's always good  Makes for interesting life 
[01:26:30]  I have a real cross section  Of experience  Which is kind of neat  Because I meet a lot of people  People come to meet me  And I can  I give them advice  About different stuff  I do ministry in the jail  I'm a Roman Catholic  Practicing  Traditional Roman Catholic  Old fashioned  I'm not a good example  Of Christianity  But I'm a much improved version  Of what I once was  I'd like to say first  Because  Cover all grounds  I'm also a good example  Of a hypocrite sometime  Which I'm working on  I'm working on really  And you know  But I do ministry in the jail  I do lock up  You know  The whole 
[01:27:00]  Segregation  Remand  Stuff like that  With the guys  And the guys  That's a noble thing  Hey is there  A rule on that road  Where  No matter what  If you see someone stranded  Do you stop  And give a hand  And do people stop  For you  If people need to  Yeah we stop  Yeah  There's some people  That don't  But it's still  Like when we're  Working in the north  Generally people will stop  But there's  There's still guys  That don't  I mean we  You know  Guys will stop  You know  They need antifreeze  Guys will give you 
[01:27:30]  Their antifreeze  Give you their oil  Never come looking for it  I saw an episode  Where a guy was stuck  As his rig was busted  And another guy  Had driven really far  Comes up and goes  Alright I'll take your rig  And drive it back  I mean the amount of miles  You guys put on  The vehicles and yourselves  In just a couple of days  Is astounding  Because it's like  The guy's driving  If I was driving somewhere  And had a destination  The last thing I'm going to do  Is put another guy's rig on there  And drive all the way back 
[01:28:00]  From where I came from  Yeah but you guys  Are sitting here on your butts  Making puppies  Like you know  You're right  You're right  We're fruits  If you get in a truck  And you just drive  And you drive all day  And you drive for 10 hours or so  You go a long ways  Yeah yeah  You know so you say  Well it's just a day's drive  I mean I've brought guys back  You know guys  Tractors broke down  You load your truck on there  And if they get a tow truck  It's going to cost a lot of money  And get somebody else  Hoping that down the road  That generally the same guy  Isn't there when you break down  That somebody else will say  Hey I'll take your trailer  I'll take your truck 
[01:28:30]  And help you out  And sometimes you help people out  And nobody else helps you out  But that's the way it is  I mean it's better  Like the whole thing is  If you really believe  That the world is a worse place  That means every 6 billion people  Are all doing a little bit more bad than good  And if you think it's a better place  That means 6 billion people  Are doing a little bit more good than bad  And the way to make it that way  Is to do it yourself  And as soon as you become a giver  Rather than a taker  Then you've changed the world  And then one more person  And it'll touch somebody else  And you'll make the world a better place  So you really don't worry about the people 
[01:29:00]  That may not come by  And what are you doing patting my back there  No he's saying you've got to go  Because you have a TV spot  Your son's telling you you have to go  You've got a TV spot  You've got a TV to do  Screw this radio crap  It gets you all profound and everything  I like that  It was great man  I recommend the book  I actually really want to read it now  And now I want to watch the show  Because you're a very interesting guy  That's great  Well thank you very much  Alex Deva Gorski  So I can't talk to you guys  At a 20 bucks each  Or don't each  For the new teeth  Come on

[01:30:30]  No trust me  You got to have this guy in  He's great  And you know what  That's why we have Roland around  Because he's crazy  That guy's insane  You think that guy's crazy  Yeah it's the whole way  I don't think he's crazy  I think he's just naive  As far as how the rest of the world is  But it's yeah  He knows what he knows  And he knows it very well  He has his place where he lives  You're only as crazy as where you come from I guess  Yeah  You know if you go from one place to another  You could be completely insane  But you're fine where you're from  And you did notice that I hid my yogurt 
[01:31:00]  Oh I know  That is spelled F-A-G  And then there is an E  But who cares about the E  After the word starts with F-A-G  That's my yogurt  He came in  He came in  He's just holding his eggs and potatoes  And he's shoveling his mouth  Just shoveling  He's just talking  And Opie's got his yogurt and granola  And Jimmy's got his little faggot food  I just start sliding mine away  I couldn't have felt worse if I was eating out of a pair of balls  That's a real man  If you think you're a man 
[01:31:30]  It's guys like that that make you realize nah  No you're not  I almost broke down and cried  Because I had to change my tire when it was like 20 degrees out  Oh I know yeah  And he's talking about well you know  40 below  100 below  Wind blowing  They're on this ice fucking road  I'm defrosting my brakes so I can survive  He's with a torch underneath his truck  Trying to defrost a brake  It's like  I got a flat  Hello  Here's me  Hello Mr. Kumia  On Star 
[01:32:00]  Can we help you?  I got a flat tire  We'll send somebody immediately  Please hurry  I'm in the middle of nowhere  I think it's Hop Hog  Can you please tell me if there's a Starbucks nearby?  Yeah  Yeah  But I can wait  Yes there's one a half a block away  You could probably walk there  Walk  He's dealing with grizzly bears  Yeah yeah  Bears and ice and fucking  He could fall into a river or off a ravine 
[01:32:30]  Telling us how  He basically said how great it is to breathe in minus 40 degree weather  Yeah to him that's refreshing  Refreshing  Exactly  Where it's so cold you could hear the northern lights crackling  He did say that right  That's fucking cold  That is cold  How cold is it?  I'm glad I wasn't in here for this  I don't need to feel less like a man than I already do  Less like a man  Yeah  This would have put me over the edge  Yeah you need shoulders to interview the guy  I'm sorry  I had said 
[01:33:00]  You didn't pass the test  I had said  I had said  I felt like  To interview the ice road trucker  We felt like such fags just sitting here in front of like a real man  And Jimmy  We feel like fags sitting in front of the out cue guys  We're just faggots  We're just faggots  I think those two guys are more manly than us  They're the ones that do the morning show  I ride the elevator up  There's a black guy and a white guy  I ride the elevator up almost every morning with the black guy  They're nice guys  Yeah  That was called contributing nothing  To the conversation  Gives a shit  I should have thought that  The whole kid in his side 
[01:33:30]  Really Jim  The whole kid in his side  You know  Somebody wants a montage of all the great laughs over the years  From this radio show  That's true  Alex could have had the greatest laugh ever right there  Yeah  The one where he just kept going and going and going  It was psychotic  Me and Danny looked at each other like this guy's out of his mind  Maybe if there was a mic in the boss's office a month ago  He could have  Yeah  Really you had to do that to me today right  Hey see that  Finally I'm over that bullshit  No that to me is like in a joking context for what we're doing  So you know 
[01:34:00]  They'd understand that  Yeah let's hear the laugh again  Give me back  Shit man  That's the last thing a hooker hears  Before her life just slowly seeps away from being strangled in the back of his cab  Yeah the sound in an altar boy's ear  Oh god  Just remembers it forever 
[01:34:30]  She hears that laugh and then she wonders  What is that sound of something cutting through the air  Not realizing that it's a hoe headed for the back of her head  Swinging a garden implement  I wanted to talk to the guy about how long like their summer is  When does it start snowing  He just wanted to talk about whatever the fuck he wanted to talk about  I mean how many days of summer do you think they get  A week or two maybe  A couple weeks  It's gotta be nothing  Five weeks maybe  It's gotta be nothing  It's always dark  It's always just dark there  And that I don't want to know about  It's expensive too 
[01:35:00]  Did you ever go up to Alaska?  No  They're in Alaska right?  Well they're kind of in the Canadian part next to Alaska  I did a show in Alaska  I did some shit club up there  And it was really fucking expensive  Because you forget they got to import everything  Everything has to come from there  Into the fucking state  And it looks like you're in shithole South Jersey or something  And you're paying like $14 for a fucking cheeseburger  This place sucks  It didn't match up right?  Yeah  This is in Venice  It's fucking  That's the same thing with Hawaii 
[01:35:30]  But it's fucking Hawaii  Yeah  It's like I'm in Hawaii  This is beautiful  Hawaii  Yeah  Alright why don't we move on  A couple things  Can we do the Larry King really fast  And then we're going to move into October  What did he do?  He had a senile moment?  I have not seen this yet  But people are saying it could be his greatest fuck up yet  It's too bad he's going away what?  At the end of the year?  He's only got a month or two left?  December 18th I think is his last day  So less than two months  We say goodbye to Larry King  Ah there he is with Jesse Ventura 
[01:36:00]  How old is he now?  He's about 62  That's it?  No way  Jesus Christ  Jesus to you  What the fuck?  He's got to be pushing 80 at least  Gary Gullible  He's already 80  Gary Gullible  I don't fucking know  I don't watch him  Watch that old douche  Is this it?  Ah Larry  Once it loads it will be  Yeah I know  The old load  That's why  Computers are the worst here 
[01:36:30]  Oh here we go  Got to pot it up  Julian  Shortly before the massive release of the Iraqi war documents  You walked out of an interview by CNN's Atika Schubert  She asked you about any turmoil within WikiLeaks  And about accusations of rape and molestation by two Swedish women  He's walking off again apparently  Why would you not respond to that question?  Daniel are you still there? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah sure  I guess you can't answer for him  Oh that was the video from before you still  Oh wow  Why did you walk off?  Jesus  Well I didn't walk off Larry just then  But perhaps  Perhaps  Alright  Obviously  Obviously the obvious  That audio's not slowed down?  No  Then he's on some  He was on a pill or something  He was slurring  And then they went to the video clip  Because Larry's talking about the guy walking off of this woman's interview 
[01:37:30]  So they switched to the video clip  Now what Larry's looking at is a big screen in front of him  Because this guy isn't in Larry's studio  He's on a remote location  So Larry's looking at the screen  They switched to the replay  Of when he did walk off that woman's show  You see the woman sitting there  The interviewer  And you see him in a totally different outfit  Yeah  And he's getting up  Taking his equipment off  His mic off  And Larry's just like  Oh he's walking off again 
[01:38:00]  Why won't you respond to this?  In Larry's defense  It's hard to concentrate on the hearing now  When you're shitting your pants  Yeah  You know  Oh my god  It was  How many years ago?  75 years ago  That Hindenburg exploded  Oh my god  A dirigible's blowing up  In Lakers, New Jersey  As we speak  Oh look  My god  I guess it  It injured the camera  Because it's in black and white  We're going to try to get the color feed to you 
[01:38:30]  You've got to update your impression though  We've got an under the  Well that's what I'm doing  I'm sorry  We've got an under the influence  Larry King  In my humble opinion  He sounded fucked up  Let's hear that again man  Listen to this  Listen right when he starts  He sounds fucked up  And I thought the audio was fucked up  Julian  Shortly before the massive release of the Iraqi war documents  You walked out of an interview by CNN's Atika Schubert  Atika Schubert  Just about any turmoil within WikiLeaks  And about accusations of rape and molestation 
[01:39:00]  Sounds like Liza Minnelli  He's walking off again apparently  No  Why would you not respond to that person?  Daniel are you still there?  Yeah sure  I guess you can answer for him  Answer for him  Look at the guy  He looks over like  Wait a minute  He's here  I'm sorry  That threw me Julian  I haven't walked off  Why did you walk off  Oh my god  Ladies and gentlemen  Terrible news  Wow  President Kennedy has been shot 
[01:39:30]  I've seen it with my own eyes  Oh my god  They're driving away at a high rate of speed  I hope the president is okay  This is terrible  The second tower has fallen  It's falling down  I believe this could be terrorist related  You're missing the obvious  Frankie Blue  Frankie  Sounds like Frankie Blue  Drunk off his ass  One of our favorites of all time  Wow  Now I'm gonna fuck that listener  He is trashed on some type of medication 
[01:40:00]  Something's going on with Larry  And he completely lost his fucking bearings there  Are people commenting that he was under the influence  Or are they just saying  Oh Larry fucked up again  Has he been like this consistently on the show  Or was it like all of a sudden  On this one episode  He's fucked  Not that bad  But he gets everything wrong  Everything wrong  And his dumb questions are  There was one woman that actually  What was she talking about  Being abducted from a car  Yeah  After shopping  She went to the supermarket 
[01:40:30]  And she was going home  And she got abducted with her groceries  And then the guy took her to some obscure barn or something  And raped the shit out of her  Raped her  So Larry's question was  What happened to the groceries?  He actually said that  It could be the greatest thing ever said on TV  Stop it  And she was like  What happened to the groceries?  Iraq  Can you go find that?  Oh my god  It's like  You gotta hear it for yourself  Did you hear what this woman just said?  Jesus Christ  That is fantastic 
[01:41:00]  Jesus Christ  Did he rape the groceries too?  Yeah  What type of grocery?  Were the groceries asking for it?  This show is just not going to be the same  When he retires  Baguettes can be quite whore-ish  Who's going to take over?  Is Joy Behar going to take over?  I think some limey  The British guy from America  He's got talent  Ah great  Piers Morgan  Piers Morgan or something like that  Whatever his name is  I'm going to watch TV 
[01:41:30]  I'm really out of fucking touch with everything  I don't watch Larry King  I just hear about the clips  And there's a lot of them  He's leaving again  Everyone's leaving  Oh my god  Yeah it's  It's  It's  You know  I've never been a big fan of the guy  But it's sad to watch these guys go down  It's fantastic to watch  It's just a marker of time though  It's just sad  Well it is  It is  There before the grace of God  And time  Go high  That's pretty much what we're looking at 
[01:42:00]  There's your future fucker  You want to keep that mic slung in front of you  There it is  Ah  What are we doing today  Is he going to become like Ebert  Like commentating with a robot void  Like it's just like  Dude it's just like sad man  Like just  Come on  Larry  Larry will retire  And he'll be dead within a year  Yeah  That's what happens to these guys  That's what time it kills people  Yeah  It kills people  A year  You only give it a year  Maybe two  Maybe two  I'll take a bet with you on it  Maybe two  He'll fade into obscurity  He's going to be one of those guys 
[01:42:30]  Where he doesn't know what to do with himself  Because he retired  And then all of a sudden  He's just got to die  I'm going to bet that he dies  Six weeks before he retires  That's right about now  Any day now  Wow he's on something though  In that clip  That sounded like our old bit  Where we slow down the audio  I know  He really is  E-Rock attempting to run  Which is  Oh my god  Look at him  He's doing the fast shuffle  Which is greatly appreciated  Look at the fast shuffle  He's trying to read and walk at the same time  I hope he hits the wall  Well what the fuck  Hey E-Rock 
[01:43:00]  Ice Road Trucker made fun of you  Okay you said  You alright  No he's not  What's the matter Sam  Oh what's the matter  I'm just saying  He looks very very flustered  Wow something's wrong with you  Because he's been asked to do things  Sweetie what's the matter  E-Rock you alright  E-Rock what happened  You're flustered  There's a pro  Oh shit he just hit Sam  Ow  There's a problem  What's wrong  Nothing  I ran back to get that  To make sure I had the right clips  See it's like very  You are flustered  Yeah a little bit  What happened  Why  He's being asked

[01:44:00]  Saw J  Ah Chip  What's it from  I don't know  Sandwiches  Okay sandwiches  Sandwiches  Are you part Eskimo  No  Why what happened  Look at his eyes  German Irish  German Irish  Well let me tell you my  Maybe just sleepy  Your eyes look Eskimo-ish today  Alright well  Let me um  Thank you  There you go  Clicking jaw and everything 
[01:44:30]  There you go  He's got an ailment  Opened his mouth  It sounded like a velociraptor claw  The fucking defeat  On Obie's face  He's going  Eh whatever  I was hoping  We were going to find out  Something new  And then we could beat him up  For an hour  I was praying he was going to say  God how did you know  I was asking him  Oh  The clicking jaw  Here come the jokes  Alright here we go  Larry King  For Joe DeRosa  Actually it's one of our favorite  This uh  Larry King gets to the bottom  Of things asking  The crucial questions  He's talking to a rape victim here 
[01:45:00]  What was that accent Stephen  Where is he from  That's a  That's a marine accent  It's been my experience  That uh  That the Jarhead clan  Almost has their own vernacular  Their own accent  Uh  It's uh  I'd say there's a bit of Virginia  In there  A little Tidewater Virginia  Um  And maybe a few other things as well  It's made up  Do you remember the movie  A Few Good Men  With Jack Nicholson  Uh  Played that  Incredible part  Well Stephen Lang 
[01:45:30]  Did it on Broadway  And he was incredible  With that  That great line right  You wouldn't know the truth  You can't handle the truth  You wouldn't know the truth  Good clip  But that's not the clip  That famous line  I was  I wouldn't know the line  Yeah what's that famous line  Uh  Uh  Play it for the first time  Sam  Asshole  I love that movie  What did he say  Did the uh  What happened to the groceries  Was that the line  Yeah what was that  You are  I remember that 
[01:46:00]  The track listing  Doesn't match up  It was supposed to be  I don't know why  It's not  I could have been a container  I'm gonna make you an offer  You can't understand  I think this is it  I think this is the set up  Larry King gets to the bottom  Of things  Asking the crucial  Crucial questions  About a rape victim  As I came out of the grocery store  And got my car  Philip knocked on my window  And said uh  You know 
[01:46:30]  I can't seem to get my car to start  It's cold  Do you think you'd give me a ride  You know  Which way are you going  And of course  He was gonna go anyway  Any which way I was going  And so  I did  Why did you let him in the car  I don't know  It was the worst  Decision I've ever made  I think  It truly was  What happened when he got in  When he got in  I filled his hands  With a lot of food  That I had in the front seat  Anyway  I tried to engage him  He was holding your food  He was  I tried to engage him  In small conversation 
[01:47:00]  On the trip  I tried to stay on the main street  And when I got ready to turn  He said  Well where I'm staying  Is right up the road here  So I took him a little further up  And then  Just turned around the corner  And pulled over  And he  Slammed my head  Into the steering wheel  And pulled out handcuffs  He took my keys out  Threw him on the floor  And pulled out handcuffs  And handcuffed me  And  And uh  Said I just want a piece of ass  If you're  If you be good  You won't get hurt  What did he do with the food? 
[01:47:30]  He put her on the floor I guess  I don't know  Jesus Christ  It's just this horrifying moment  Jesus Christ  He prepared it Larry  Yeah  What did he do with the food?  She was looking for some compassion  You hear how she answered that?  Yeah  Like are you fucking kidding me?  Put her on the floor  Dummy  Yeah  What do you think?  The toe  Oh my god  He reenacted nine and a half weeks with it  It was very romantic  No  He shoved the zucchini up my pussy  Her giving details  Couldn't be more dramatic  Oh my god 
[01:48:00]  It just couldn't be more dramatic  And this is what this fool does  And uh  Said I just want a piece of ass  If you're  If you be good  You won't get hurt  What did he do with the food?  He put her on the floor I guess  I don't know  I guess  I guess  I don't know  I was being raped  I was being cuffed  At this point he had a fist in my ass Larry  I don't know  What was happening to my fucking  I can't answer you  My yogurt  Well Larry that was actually the payoff for the rave  Was he made a bolognese afterwards  That part I appreciated  Yes  They had a CVS card 
[01:48:30]  What an asshole  What  Do you like Trader Joe's  Paper or plastic  Jesus Christ  The best part though  How her voice goes up  I don't know Larry  I don't know Larry  I was kind of busy  Hoping that I was going to survive this  Yeah  Ordeal  Was there anything heavy on top of the eggs?  Comment  Did you notice  While your teeth were being  Caved in off the steering wheel  Were you angry with the bag boy  For squishing your bread?  Don't you hate when the bag opens 
[01:49:00]  And the apples fall all over the floor?  You can never get that one  As you're driving to the hospital  After a brutal rape  Comment  Yeah  Were you as bruised as one of those apples  After he finished with you?  The only crime worse than rape  Is when the ice cream starts to melt  Before you get them into the freezer  Were you concerned about the Haagen-Dazs?  Was the heat on the milk?  Did it sour the milk?  Did you notice that?  While you were being dehumanized? 
[01:49:30]  Comment  I think we got one more from him  If we're going down this road  We might as well  Yeah  We might as well  Then it was this  Same interview  Alright now you're in a car  You're handcuffed  How does this happen?  How was he able to consummate this?  Well  You mean how was he able to handcuff me?  No, rape you  No, no, no  What hole did he stick his cock in?  Mouth counter-ass  Comment  How was he able to consummate this?  Consummate  It's a marriage 
[01:50:00]  He had you handcuffed  How did he fuck you?  He did not say  Consummate  She goes  What, you mean handcuff me?  And he goes  No, rape you  No, rape you  That's delicate  How did he rape you?  See, he put his cock  Inside me against my will  That's rape  That's forced it in  Yeah, that's how you do a delicate interview  With a rape  No, rape  How did he get his nipples played with while he had sex with you?  I can't keep an erection without a comment  Well, Larry, the rape felt like this interview  Without the doddering 
[01:50:30]  Well, you mean how was he able to handcuff me?  No, rape you  Oh, well he took me to a mini warehouse  Well, he took you out of there  Yes, he transferred me  After he handcuffed me  He transferred me into the passenger seat  He pulled a leather strap out of his hair  And he tied my head to my knees  Were you fearing for your life?  I was  I thought I was dead  No, no, I knew I would be let go after the rape, Larry  He was taking me to a location  I knew I would be fine  After that  They always rape you and let you go  While you see their face 
[01:51:00]  What was stored in the warehouse?  Do you know what kind of rent they were paying there?  Is it unionized?  Comment  Did you ever see Law Abiding Citizen?  Was it like that part in the movie?  Just like it  I like how he asked her about that  Then he raped you repeatedly  And just kept fucking you  Yeah  Deep dicking you  Yes  Unbelievable  How'd you evacuate it?  Or when he put it in your butthole  Did he get shit on his dick in underwear?  How'd he consummate it with shit on his dick? 
[01:51:30]  Consummate  That smell always kills my erection  Until I realize it's from me  Were you fearing for your life?  I was  I thought I was dead  And then he what?  Raped you repeatedly?  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  Yeah, Larry  Uh-huh  Yeah, Larry  Did you enjoy it?  Yeah  What?  Larry, what?  Yeah  Sorry  Jesus Christ almighty, man  That's fucking insane  Now, here's the question I have is why 
[01:52:00]  I mean, for Christ  They shoved Carson out  Yeah, yeah  And Carson was still killing  And doing all right  Absolutely  He was still running the show  Why have they not shoved this fucking guy off the air yet?  They kept him on the air way too fucking long  Because his ratings were still up there  But in the last year or two  You know, not so much  So finally they got an exit strategy for him  We have a whole disc of his  His fuck-ups  His fuck-ups  And we got a new one to add  We got a new one to add  That's a great one  Today  He's walking off again 
[01:52:30]  Jesus, Larry  Your show's being seen all over the world  Ladies and gentlemen  Man is walking on the moon  As I'm watching  Man is on the moon  Astounding  Look, Walter Cronkite has a tear in his eye  Wait, he's dead  Walter Cronkite has been raped in a warehouse  Wait a minute  What did you do with the groceries  After the Ted Offensive announcement? 
[01:53:00]  That's right  When Johnson said the war is unwinnable  Or when you did  Who said that?  What?  After Kennedy got shot  He interviewed Governor Connolly  Do you still have the hat you were holding?  What happened to the hat?  That's a great hat  Who cleaned the car?  How much did that cost?  Do you still do tricks with the magic bullet?  Like make it your thumb and detach it  Or tell a child it's his nose 
[01:53:30]  How much did it cost to fill in the concretes  That got knocked out by the bullet that hit James Hay  Was that a unionized job, Conant?  Abraham's a pruder  How much do you pay your secretary that you were there with?  Oh, man  What an adult  Where did you buy the film?  For the camera  For the camera  For the film  When did the Kennedy assassinate?  When Kevin Costner videotaped Kennedy getting shot 
[01:54:00]  How much did he charge you for that footage?  What kind of books were in the book depository?  Do you think Oswald sat back and just read a little after he shot the president?  Comment  What did he read?  Harry Potter?  These books are very popular  Was it Kentucky bluegrass on the grassy knoll?  Or a feather bent 
[01:54:30]  Feather lead bent?  Why is knoll spelled with a K?  Comment  He's fucked  What is he doing?  He's done  He's done  And that incontinent asshole has had his dick  In a hotter snatch than I'll ever see in my life  He just keeps fucking getting married, having kids  Oh my god  I don't even know  What's that?  Chance  Isn't that the last kid he had? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah  It's my kid Chance  He had that kid too  That he like gave up for adoption  And then the kid came back and found him  Did you hear about that?  Oh really?

[02:07:00]  The rules posted  On a website  Now the fugitive  Has to give the rules  Which totally  Brick takes you  Out of the bed  You know who I want  To see win this  Paul Kersey  I'm Paul Kersey  I like that you did  The gun  All you have to do  Is listen  At 10  12  2  4  6  Take everything  That I say  Write it down  Look at it  From all sorts  Of different angles  Think about it  Put it together 
[02:07:30]  I could be 
[02:08:00]  Anybody  I could be  The person  In the cubicle  Next to you  I could be  The guy at Starbucks  Who gives you  Your coffee  Every day  Really  I could be  The girl  Who is the crossing  Guard  At your kids  School  Ask everybody  You see  Are you the  iPowered  92 one  $5,000 fugitive  If you ask me  And you ask me  Wrong  I'll just look at you  Like you're the fool  That you are  So shut up  And listen

[02:09:00]  Go Jimmy  Fucking  Sucks  Hey here's a good way  To get our station name  Out there  So you have to say  The station name  Yeah what does that matter  Do you think  It's  And no one's gonna do it  For $5,000  If you had a real  Cash prize  Then maybe you would  Get people doing it  But not for  Who's gonna do that  Shit for $5,000  The dumb fucks  That listen to that station  Will do it  And I don't mean that  Racially  Because it's a hip hop station  I'm just saying  If you fucking think  If you think 
[02:09:30]  That's entertaining  You would do it  For $5,000  You're not right Joe  Really  That's how sad  It really is  They know this shit  Doesn't work in the end  But they have nothing else to do  They don't know what to do  It does create a buzz  It doesn't create shit  It creates nothing  What did it do  For fucking K-Rock  92.3 now  It put them on the map  You can't  It's  It's really fucking sad  Like you can't  Everything is staged  And like you were saying  They spoon feed you  They spoon feed you 
[02:10:00]  Spoon  Feedable  It's like  You don't have to  Spoon feed horse shit  It's horse shit  For a fucking reason  And then they  Spoon feed you  The horse shit  It's like  They can't even do a prank  Where people would be like  Wow is something going on  Like  For a second  You can't  You can't do a fucking prank  Every prank call now  Is staged  These things are all staged  Because this fucking  Everything is so fucking  Emasculated and pussified now  You can't fucking do anything  And this bit would almost work  If you just threw it out there 
[02:10:30]  But as soon as you start  Giving the rules  People are like  Oh okay  More fake dumb radio  It's terrible  It's terrible  Well like  That's exactly what  George Harrison's  Gutter hat  Has said  Oh we're in the chat room  Is that one of the names  Yes  George Harrison's  Gutter hat  His hat with the gutters  On it  To catch his goopy brain  George Harrison's gutter

[02:17:00]  I don't even  I can't even hate  The radio show  It's the fucking  They're forced to do it  It's their bosses  And the promotion  Sucks  They can't think of  Their own shit  So they get these bits  From a company  And it's because  You know how lame that is  You're supposed to be hiring  People that know how to talk  And might be a little creative  And you can't even come up  With your own shit  It's because they have fucking  That's what's even more enraging  This bit's being done  All over the country  Fuck them  I hate the radio show  It's a bad bit  Because  Your path that you take 
[02:17:30]  Leads you there  You know what I mean  It's like  That's where they led themselves  Fuck them  You wear the fucking armband  You march for Hitler  Fuck them  If you got a gig  And you're doing a job  And the station's doing okay  And the fucking boss  And the station's only doing okay  Because your fucking pussy boss  Is making you play from a playlist  That tested positive  With a focus group  As a guy  Your hands are kind of tied  So they come in  They go  We're doing this bit  Because it's going to get  The fucking numbers up 
[02:18:00]  For everybody  You can't say no  Because you have to get  Your numbers  It's like  It's a bad spot to be in  And I'm not saying  The radio show's good  But I fucking despise  The people  Who make them do it  And the fucking  And the chick calling in  Stinks  Terrible  Terrible  Also it's like  If your station's not making  A lot of money  And somebody steals  A prize pack  You need that money back  You have to get it back  That is a good point  Although you're going to  Now give it to the listener  Which makes no fucking sense  They can't even figure that shit out  They really can't  Where are we at there

Yeah  Sorry  Try again  Yes  It'll be fun  All right  And walking down the hall  Danny's favorite 
[02:21:30]  Danny's losing his mind  He's been losing his mind  For the last couple of days  I don't know  My heart rate just shot up  Like double  Carrie Byron from Mythbusters  Danny is losing his mind  For Danny  She is his favorite  Of all time  It's going to be embarrassing  For Danny  Look at you  I'm already hot and sweaty  Hi Carrie  How are you?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show  Hi  How are you?  He's very  You might want to watch out  On your right there  He's very nervous  I'm trying not to look 
[02:22:00]  If I look it's going to be over  He is your biggest fan  By far  He's smitten  Carrie  I can't look at her  He's losing his mind  Are you kidding me?  This is not a joke  Oh my god  This is not a joke  He's losing his mind  Nice to meet you  I'm Jim  Oh she has such a nice handshake  Danny  He really is losing his mind  Yeah Danny has a crush on you  I promise he doesn't bite  Can you at least hug him  Just hug him  Hug him  And then we can do a real interview  Oh my god  See I told you she smelled good  I told you  Showered and everything 
[02:22:30]  Wow  He absolutely  We all love you  But he really loves you  He's crazy  In a creepy way  He's alright  He's already making me feel very comfortable  I've already made sure to like  Just hide in my little corner  So I don't get too close  Or no sharp movements  Look how ready he's getting  I can feel it  He very rarely likes girls  Who are over 18  It's kind of nice to see  An actual adult  Why don't we ask Danny  Why do you like her so much?  Well you know  I mean  Look at her  I'm a big fan of the show 
[02:23:00]  In the first place  I love Mythbusters  I've seen I think  Probably every one  A thousand times  Yeah I love the show  But it's just  It's the whole package  You know  It's the beauty  It's the brains  It's the whole thing  Right there  I could probably really creep her out  Because I know you did some event in DC  At the mall over there  Over the weekend  And I was crazy enough  Because I didn't know  We were getting you in studio  At that point  I had considered driving into DC  Just to go  Jesus  That's great  Seven hours 
[02:23:30]  Seven hours there and back  Danny why don't you just pull out  A piece of her hair  From your pocket  If she's willing to  If she's willing to part with some  I'll definitely keep it in my wallet  Lee Malvo and John Muhammad  Showed up at her DC event  She would have been less creeped out  You are really a ghoul  I didn't know  We were going to get her in  I know  Yeah you know  I knew you were in DC  And you were staying at the Radisson  So I was tempted to go  And knock on your door  And invite you to the show  He's usually not this creepy  Yeah he really is  I've never seen him like this  He usually keeps himself  Very shy  You guys really love him  You torture him like this 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  We're just getting started  Do you get that a lot  I mean you must  I mean you know  Being a very beautiful woman  Where it's typically  Just a couple of guys  You must get this all the time  No not really  We're very insular  I mean we have  Just the few of us working  Very skeleton crew  And I'm kind of a sister to them now  They don't look at me like that  Yeah but I think the fans though  The fans  Because you are getting  Some geeky guys  That like watching the show  Although the show  Does cross over  Many people  You mean the non-geeky people 
[02:24:30]  Yeah yeah  Some geeky  Non-geeky people  But you get a lot of geeky people  And you are like  Queen of the geeky people  I'll take it  That's a compliment  I love that  Because I won't put it  As mushy as Danny put it  But it is very good  To see a woman  Such as yourself  Doing things that are  Kind of cool  And mechanical  And geeky  And fun  Kind of cool  Kind of cool  I shoot  No they're very very cool  50 caliber gun  I know  One day  The next day  I go to the bomb range  I have the coolest job 
[02:25:00]  I own that rifle  I own a Barrett .50 Cal  I take it out to Calverton  Aren't they  Don't they like  Hurt your head to shoot  I wear earplugs  Yeah no but I mean  Like the concussion  Makes me feel like  You've been punched in the face  Like it's such a  Maybe I'm just a pussy  You are  I like it  I like that feeling  It is a great  It's a strange feeling  You can't explain  It's a concussion  Yeah like things move around you  If you have stuff on tables  Like three feet away  It just flies off the table  You should get along very well  I like this  Carrie's chopped down a tree 
[02:25:30]  With a minigun  What have you done  How many trees have you took out  Not many  But I did blow up a watermelon  With 50 Cal  It's because some guy  Was holding it  Desert Eagle  You were aiming at the fruits  Desert Eagle  50 Cal Desert Eagle  That's pretty impressive  Yeah you guys have gotten  Into shooting  You've gotten to shoot  Some fun guns  I know Jamie  Does a lot of the shooting  When you were doing  The ballistics  Into the pool  Which was very surprising  I thought the higher caliber  Was going to go deeper 
[02:26:00]  Than the smaller caliber  So now you know  Go figure that out  When you're being chased  By villains  Or good guys  In some cases  Die  Now what was the initial thing  Because years ago  When the show first started  It was just Adam and Jamie  Two knock around guys  Just building stuff  And blowing things up  And everything  What was the basic idea  Behind bringing you on board  And the other people  That came on after that  Well I've kind of been there  Since day one  Because I took an internship  With Mythbusters  Well actually with Jamie 
[02:26:30]  As a special effects artist  On my first day as an intern  Was the first day of filming  So you can kind of see  In some of the early episodes  When they pan across  I'll be like laughing  In the background  And that kind of stuff  I never noticed that  And then it was  It was really just kind of  A small show  On a cable channel  You know  I didn't think anybody  Was watching  And they happened to need  A woman's backside  For one of their  Yes  The famous  That was for the  Plain toilet myth  Yes  Yes  Yes  That was the first  That was the first  Thing she did  Yeah so you know  Hey I was the only girl 
[02:27:00]  At the shop  Did you have any  Reservations about that  No I really thought  Nobody would really see it  I didn't think  It would be the first thing  That would come up  When you google my name  I know  Now it just comes up  It really is  How do you say this  A terrific photo  There had to be  But I mean come on  There had to be shenanigans  Going on that day  Like it's your first day  Doing stuff  And like  What can we have her do  Oh I know what we need  Let's put her in  Skin tight spandex  No more ass  No one has ever  Brought up this myth before  Shut up  Jamie's like 
[02:27:30]  Oh I know what we can do  There's a myth  That a man can hold  His breath with an ass  On his face  You're naughty  You are naughty  Isn't he bad  But I'm just saying  That's you know  Jimmy  Sorry  So then you got  A little more involved  Though as time went on  Yeah  Obviously  And it was kind of  Kind of refreshing  To see  A little  I must say  Jamie and Adam  Nice enough guys  But not as good  To look at  I think they wanted  To get somebody 
[02:28:00]  And they got somebody  That actually  You know  Was able to do  Some of the  Some of that  Heavy work  It wasn't like a casting thing  Though  It wasn't like  We were looking for people  It was just  You know  We worked at the shop  I mean  All of those guys  Have worked together before  At ILM  I mean we're in San Francisco  We're not in an LA atmosphere  Where there's tons of people  Throwing down resumes  We all just kind of  Worked there  And they were filming us  I mean it's actual reality  It's not like we have writers  Like most reality shows  We're being followed by a camera  So we mess up  They're there  And then all of a sudden 
[02:28:30]  You start getting  Kind of noticed  I guess  You get recognized  And then being  Just being an intern  For a silly little cable show  Turns into a big show  And you didn't have any  Real fame or notoriety  Before that  So  No  Were you expecting that  At all  Are you kidding me  I had no idea  That this was going to be  My career  In fact  I'm pretty sure  My parents are psyched  I have a job  Really  I was an art major  You know  Do they still think  It's like  I can't wait  Until she gets a real job  Oh no no no 
[02:29:00]  They are so proud of me  Yeah my parents  Are silly like that  They're like  God  He does his little show  With his friends  I'm like  No it's a real job  I swear  Hey how was Obama  Was he on set  No actually  Jamie and Adam  Went to the White House  And they did a little thing  And he just issued  A challenge for us  He didn't actually  Participate in the rest  Of the myth  We used his contacts  Try to keep your tax money  Is that the challenge  Sorry  Sorry not a fan  So wait  The myth is  I'm going to be able 
[02:29:30]  To keep more than  Half my income  Oops  Oh no  Busted  Did they get to meet him  Oh yeah yeah  Why didn't you go  Were you kind of annoyed  When they're like  Look you're going to  Have to sit this one out  No actually  I was working on  Something really cool  Back in San Francisco  You'd blow that off  To meet the president  What's cooler than  Going to White House  Hanging out with Obama  Well I mean  That's pretty cool  But I mean  It was pretty cool  To also be doing  Building something  Explodes  Or rocket powered  Or something very heavy  And car crushing  That might be happening  We're in the episode  Where we have another myth 
[02:30:00]  That we're doing  At the same time  And Jamie and Adam  Are working on that one  And Obama basically  Just gave us  500 school kids  He gave us the contacts  To get 500 kids  To help them out  I mean  That was amazing  Oh okay  I wonder what they're doing  Oh that's pretty public  He wanted us to  Retest the solar  Oh the solar  Burning the ships  Yeah the Archimedes death ray  He believes it right  I wouldn't say he believes it  He just didn't like  Our methodology  Of how we tested it  Well maybe you didn't like  His policy on health care 
[02:30:30]  If I asked  It would have ruined the episode  To ask what about  The myth being busted your way  Did he not agree with  He thought we didn't have  Enough manpower  He wanted to see  Actually what it would have  Just take the 10%  Of the country  That's unemployed  Sorry I'm not a fan  Okay I'm guessing  Got that a while ago  What I really love about this  Is we're working with  The STEM program  Which is the  Science, Technology, Engineering  Mathematics 
[02:31:00]  Which kids are not  Getting into science anymore  So it's really nice  To see a big push  To try to get kids  Into science  Because we're  You know the pipeline  For scientists and engineers  Is drying up in America  And we need some  Homegrown cures for cancer  For solutions for pollution  But do you think  That kids are getting  More into science these days  As opposed to maybe  10 years ago  Because of the popularity  Of channels like Discovery  And the Science Channel  And history  And shows like Mythbusters  And things like that  I'm going to say yes  Yeah yeah  Yes  Exactly 
[02:31:30]  Exactly  I have a big impact  On the world  You know  I was a terrible student  And I certainly wasn't  Interested in science  I mean I like science  I wasn't interested in it  Up until  I mean you put on  Discovery Channel  24 hours a day  I know  I wasn't interested in science  Until I heard you were in D.C.  And I had to get a telescope  Rose is just mad  Because he got bumped  Off the big boy table  I don't like it  I'm back here  Like a fucking dog  Have your macaroni and cheese  Back there 
[02:32:00]  We made him get out  Of the big boy seat  You're in his table  Danny made me move  I feel bad  This is how I know  Danny's nervous  Because I've interviewed people  That I was very nervous  Interviewing  But I know Danny's like  He's never like this  He's asking questions  And they're not moving  So do you think  Science was always popular  And then he just stops  I knew he was nervous  When he said shenanigans  Pardon my French  Not at all  I like the shenanigans  You do a show also 
[02:32:30]  Called Head Rush  Yeah that's focused  At the kids  And that's focused  Yeah it's kind of like  Mythbusters  But geared more toward  Teens and stuff  It's commercial free  Yeah it's Mythbusters  But commercial free  And instead of commercials  I do experiments  Sort of like  Bill Nye the science guy  Kind of little  Small experiments  A little different  You don't have to  Explain it to me  Thank you  A little different  Than Bill Nye  A DVR Head Rush  I don't tune in Bill Nye  To just look at Bill Nye  Bill Nye is awesome  I know  But you're awesomer 
[02:33:00]  Well I'll take that  As a compliment  Because I definitely  Respect the guy  Yeah  Was he a role model?  It's like Mr. Wizard  Yeah  Was Mr. Wizard  A role model?  Man I met Bill Nye  At a party  And actually he's  A fun guy to talk to  Really?  At a party?  Yeah  Just drinking out of a beaker  Oh yeah  It's fun  Who's Bill Nye  I don't know the name  Bill Nye the science guy  What's wrong with you Jimmy?  I don't know the name  Jimmy  I don't know who the Mythbusters are  I just don't know who Bill Nye is  You've never watched an episode 
[02:33:30]  Of Mythbusters?  Yes I have  I'm turning you in right now  They did a great one about  Pulling a fucking phone  Two phone books apart  Oh yeah yeah  Phone books friction  It was amazing  Wait you can swear here?  Yeah  We're on Sirius  That's why you can be on the radio  Yes I'm very good  I don't curse that much though  He's behaving actually  I'm a fan of yours  Oh thank you  Yeah  Thank you  I know you're naughty so  Thank you very much  But you've seen him before?  Well you know  I saw you on the Louis show  God damn it 
[02:34:00]  Now I want to kill Jim  Why?  We hate when people come in here  And know Jimmy  Why not?  We just don't like him  Can't Carrie and I just get along  And have a couple people  That kind of get to know each other  What'd you call it?  Carrie?  Carrie  Sorry it was Carrie  Can't Carrie and I get along  So you saw the trailer  For one of the shows  Where they put the phone book together  With the pages  And now you've seen every episode  No Tanks it actually  Took to pull it apart  I'm so trying to undermine this  Oh no but Tanks it took to pull it apart  Is that true?  He knows he knows  I know  Jimmy  He's watched 
[02:34:30]  Are you a married woman?  Yes  Yes I'm married  And a little baby  Yeah  You had to take a little leave of absence  I did  Did you miss the show?  You know  I was pretty happy to be home  For four months  It was a nice little vacation  It was a nice vacation  Because I worked  Until I was ten months pregnant  So I was at the bomb range  When I was gigantic  Bomb range  That's great  Yeah  Being pregnant at the bomb range  Is a hard thing to do  There's lots of hills  There's no place to go to the bathroom  It's insane  How do you guys  I know sometimes 
[02:35:00]  You've had insurance issues  Where they're like  Oh they won't allow us to do this  But then you're able to  Completely  Destroy and explode  A cement mixer  Well yeah  But I mean  The things that insurance  Has a problem with  Are usually things  That are going to cause  Us bodily harm  But we have so many experts  With us  Like the bomb range  Is the safest place to be  When we're doing stuff like that  We've got FBI  We've got the bomb techs  We've got all these experts  Keeping us safe  We're in bunkers  How did a little show  Get to like do that  If you put together  When they first started 
[02:35:30]  A little show  Going like  Hey we want to blow something up  Let's call the FBI  And get some dynamite  Like it seems like  It would be a very  Difficult thing to do  Yeah but think about  What some of these guys  Do on a regular basis  And it's gonna  They get to actually  Go out to the bomb range  And blow things up  And have fun  Yeah you know  They're not out  Giving tickets or anything  I bet we wouldn't  Be able to do that though  Hi we do a radio show  And we'd like to blow something up  They'd be cuffing us  Yeah of course  Investigating us  Where do you guys go  How far is this  From where you go  I guess you have  A giant open area  You go to 
[02:36:00]  Yeah it's a baseball field  In Frisco  I'm curious as to how far  It is  It's a very metropolitan area  It's about an  I think an hour from us  The Bay Area is awesome  We have everything we need  We have all these  Abandoned naval bases  And all these open areas  And the city right in the middle  Has everything we need  Like you know  Metal shops  And wood shops  It is amazing  It's like oh  We need a house  Because you're doing  The experiment with the  The bug  You take the bug spray stuff  The bombs  Bug bombs  And fill up a house with it  And it's like oh 
[02:36:30]  Yeah we need a house  To explode  But we have like  This amazing team  Of really charming researchers  That toss people  Into the most amazing things  Like we got a 747  To play with  Yeah  I mean who gets that  Yeah that was a good one too  Yeah  What was the most shocking myth  That was actually true  That you thought was bullshit  Well it's actually not  A big crazy one  It's kind of a small one  We had this gag  We were doing red flag  To a bowl  Where we were trying to see  If the red actually  Aggravated them  And so just as a gag  We're like let's do  Bowl in a china shop 
[02:37:00]  You know  It'll just be funny  We'll see a bunch of carnage  So we set up this china shop  With a whole bunch  Of thrift store dishes  And in like a small pin  It was probably like  15 by 15  And just let a bowl loose  And we thought  He would just smash everything  Such agility and grace  Danced around  All the shells  Didn't knock over  One dish  He straightened a Hummel  That's crazy  That's great  We released 2, 3, 4, 5 bowls  Didn't knock over a dish  We actually had more dishes  Knocked over in the thrift store 
[02:37:30]  By my co-host Tori  When we were trying to buy the dishes  Than any of the bowls  Here's the video  Oh wow look at this bowl  He's actually shopping  Shopping  Yeah I mean  That was pretty insane  That was a good one  Was that your favorite myth?  What was your favorite myth?  Oh man  Demolition Derby by far  Yeah that was a good one  Yeah  I was in a Sikorsky helicopter  Dropping a car  Trying to hit an X  And Grant was radio controlling a car  From the other end of the desert 
[02:38:00]  And we were trying to make  The two cars meet at the middle  And that was crazy  You get to do fun things  That's awesome  I do  You know going back to that insurance thing  I was actually surprised  One of the last episodes  Cold feet  With Tori  I mean they put him in  The whole myth was to see  If cold feet  Was something that you can get  Like if you could be scared enough  Where your feet actually get colder  Than your core temperature  And they put Tori  In a stunt plane  And took him up  And started doing some  Pretty sick shit  Doing like three  Like three and a half G's  And as I'm seeing him  Get into this cockpit 
[02:38:30]  And go down the road  I'm like they're not  Going to let him do this  Like there's no way  Because I know that  Some of the stuff  That they haven't been able  To do in the past  Yeah  Sure enough the guy  Took him up  We gave him a parachute  I was really  I was surprised about that  We scared the heck out of him  Though  You know what you don't see  On the show  As I talk to the pilot  I'm like can you  Can you freak him out a little bit  Can you maybe  Can you maybe say some stuff  Can you like maybe  Make the plane stall  Just a little bit  And be like  Really get ready  We're going to have to jump  Could you do something  And so he definitely  Had a few extra thrills  Up there that you didn't see  The pilot was showing him  How to roll off of the wing 
[02:39:00]  In case he has to eject  Oh my god  Was it a military jet  Or was it a  No no no  It was a stunt plane  So how do you roll off the wing  What does that mean  Well like if you fall out  Oh  You don't want to jump out  They were playing with his head  And trying to gas him up  But uh  Well yeah  Because if you fall out of the plane  You're probably going to hit the tail  So they were showing you  How to not just get  You know  Hit by the tail  But to roll off of it  Like G.I. Joe style  Oh wow  And did his feet get cold  Not as cold as mine did  You know we had some other tests 
[02:39:30]  I don't know if  You didn't see the show  He's only seen it  I'm a fan  I watch all the time  Danny will you recite the episode  Blow by blow for us  Well it starts off with that blue paper  And then a silver sharpie  Well we were trying to test  You know what would really scare us  So we all got to come up with  What scared each other  I knew Tori was scared of heights  So we did the stunt plane  That's kind of like a thrill fear  And then Grant scared  You just bring Grant outside  You just bring him into a city environment  And he got freaked out  Oh worse  He's scared of spiders 
[02:40:00]  Are any of you scared of spiders?  No  Not at all  Unless they're on me  Like if there's one here  I'm like I don't like it  But I'm going to tell you  Okay well imagine tarantulas  The size of your hand  Being dropped in your head  While your head is sealed  In a glass box  No  I've done other things  In a glass box  Naughty  So wait  Alright so they put his head  We made a torture chair  We made him sit in a chair  He had to sit there  We put a box over his head  And there's a little hole in the top  And then I just start  Dropping tarantulas on him 
[02:40:30]  Yeah  Was he screaming?  I mean  Oh my  He looked like he was going to wet his pants  He was so scared  Like he was going  Do they bite?  They don't bite right?  I didn't get ones that bite  I'm not that cruel  I mean I wanted to freak him out  I didn't want to kill him  That's scary though  I think the most scared I ever saw Grant  Was when you guys did that myth  Where you guys were in the water  And I think sharks  Were in the water as well  And one like brushed up against him  And apparently  He does not like  When fish touch him in the water  Apparently he claims this is a real phobia  That other people have this phobia 
[02:41:00]  That fish  Like fish touching you  Is a  Yeah I pretty much don't like that  I don't think I like that  Really?  It's about the unseen  It's about the unseen though  It's under the water  That doesn't go back to childhood at all  A hand on the knee  If I was walking down the street  And a fish touched my leg  I wouldn't care  I have a friend  The fear of Abe Vigoda  I have a friend with a fish phobia  And we went to the Museum of Natural History  Or Natural Science or whatever  And when you  You go into the room  With all the fish replicas  And she has to cover her eyes  In the room 
[02:41:30]  And scream and run through it  She can't  That's crazy  It's fucking nuts  Those are the people I like to torture  It's like that's so easy to mess with  Can I hire you to put her head in a box  And drop fish on her head  That would be awesome  Just to see what happens  Yeah you do have a torturous side of you  Yeah well I mean it goes all around  I mean I love using the taser on Tori  When he's not expecting it  It's kind of like coffee for him  Did you have a fear that you did  What was yours?  I did  Mine was more like a dread  It's kind of the gag on the show 
[02:42:00]  That they like to make me gag  They love to try to get me to throw up  And they feel like they've really accomplished something  If they can get me to fruition  If I can actually puke  Through motion or what you see?  I'm a vegetarian  Okay  So they'll like send me to the butcher  And the butcher will throw a tongue at me  And be like  Duh  They'll be like  Here's some pig entrails  Could you put this in a blender  Because we need it for something  But  Yeah in this particular case  They blindfolded me  And brought me out into the shop  And I was  The smell was so bad  I could hear them sort of dry heaving 
[02:42:30]  As they led me out  I was like  What the  What are they doing to me?  And then I sit down at this table  They take the blindfold off  And there's this sort of buffet  Of like chicken feet  Fish head  Pig entrails  Like the nastiest stuff you've ever seen  And then they bring out this platter  Of like live bugs  Of maggots  Hissing cockroaches  Scorpions  Crickets  And they said  Pick two  You have to eat them  And I was just looking  It was like salmonella  Trichinosis 
[02:43:00]  Dysentery  Like all  It looked really bad  The cleanest thing to me  Looked like the bugs  Because they were lab grade  So I figured  That would probably be the safest  So  Sure  And you know  It choked down  A little maggot  You don't get one to start with  Which actually was a good choice  Because it slithered down pretty easily  Even though it really freaked me out  Second choice was a cricket  And that was a bad choice  They're really spiky  Are they bitter?  Well I was trying to just swallow  Without chewing  Oh  Because you only got a lot of spines 
[02:43:30]  And stuff on  You can hear them inside you  It got stuck right here  And I was going  Yeah yeah  And it was alive  It was alive  It was stuck right there  And I'm torturing it  By  I did throw up  Oh you did  Well it was stuck in my throat  Good for them  But then they made me eat it again  Because it was  I had to eat it  Oh my god  I know  I said this on the show  I'm a grown woman  Boys are still trying to make me eat bugs  I can't believe this  You're a trooper  I would have eaten the maggots too  You know they're disgusting  Look at those 
[02:44:00]  No fucking way  They're the cleanest  I know  But look at that  They clean wounds  They're good if you have a wound  That's why they put maggots in a wound  They clean the wound  What year are you in?  I know  I'm just saying  How about antibiotics?  I like maggots  You know what's good for sickness?  A nice bleeding  I got some leeches  Yeah that's rough  Yeah you look really unhappy there  Oh yeah  I was  The smell around me  Was also just  It was making you want to throw up  As it was  Do you ever get scared  Doing something?  Like where you're like  Oh that's just too like scary? 
[02:44:30]  You know the shark special  We had to test whether  Sharks were afraid of flashlights  So we were put under  You're afraid of flashlights?  We'll see  I'm afraid of being in  Completely dark water  With sharks  Yeah  With the lights off  I can see that  Yeah and then at one point  That you know  Before we got our testing done  You know we turned off  All the lights  Because we had to do  A control test  To see how many sharks  Would show up in the area  To start with  So you'd feel  Whoosh  Whoosh  You didn't know  If it was a turtle  You didn't know  If it was a shark  You didn't know  If it was a diver 
[02:45:00]  And I was just like  Okay  No way  Just like come on  Buck up  I have to handle this  They're handling this  I'm handling this  Yeah you are in a boys club  Over there  So it does seem like  You have to kind of  Go one step beyond  Just keep up  Yeah  Is it different now  That you're a mom  Is there some stuff  That maybe you  Would not do now  That you would have  Previously  Um  No  No  You're a trooper  I love the fact  It's like nah  Nah I still jump 
[02:45:30]  I still jump out of planes  There's the cricket  Stuck in your throat  They have a puke  A puke cam  They're so mean  That was really bad  A puke cam  That's funny  You know what was  Kind of a  Semi-disturbing episode  It was from a while ago  But the water torture  Because yeah  You had a tough time  I don't like to bring that up  I've got nightmares  You were like  Really screwed up  About that one  Well I mean  What is it  They just did the  Chinese water torture  Where they drip water 
[02:46:00]  In your head  But we  You know  Just for the looks of it  We made this like  Splinter ridden table  And we used  Civil war shackles  To shackle us up  So that we couldn't move  And we had to be  Tortured by the water  They had to make it hot  Where's it  Right here on your forehead  It was drip drip drip  So like you couldn't  Like tune it out  Every time a drip would hit  It just brought you back  Into the fact  That you're being tortured  I don't think we really  Thought this through  As a myth  Because the best case scenario  Is torture  Yeah  It's torture  How do you not  Just move your head  To the left or right  Or do they stay 
[02:46:30]  No it was strapped down  I had this like  You couldn't move  Yeah it was strapped  With like a leather strap  And this thing  That held my face there  She got so upset  How long into it  Do you start to get  Really bothered by it  Like after how many  Is it ten minutes  Or is it an hour  That's tolerable  I was at about an hour  I started to freak out  Because I was getting  Claustrophobic  And my arms started cramping  And I  But I didn't want to call it  I didn't want to look like  A wimp  Yeah  And so the EMT  Actually had to say  You know what  She's done  Because I started to cry  A little bit  Yeah a little bit  I'll just  I'll make it  I'll make it 
[02:47:00]  And they're like  No you're done  How long would the Chinese  Do that for  Like what's  Probably days  Yeah look  She's crying  Look at I'm crying  That's terrible  Were you taking  Might all that time  Was it  You feel like  You're going to fall apart  And go to peace  Can't you see  One finger I'm all  All right  Can't you just  Quit me off  She's crying  I didn't know  I didn't  No of course  I know  You're very hopeful  I had a moment  Of sheer tear  And panic  That's the face  We want you to have  By the time  You're done  With this interview  It was so strange 
[02:47:30]  I didn't expect  Going into this  That I was going  To freak out  And start crying  In front of everybody  I mean I knew  I could get up  At any time  But the restraints  Totally made me lose it  Wow  I actually haven't  Watched this episode  Really  Oh you've never watched it  Oh no  It's like a Hannibal Lecter  Mask almost  It's falling in the face  In place  Wasn't the water  Like cold I think  The water we did  On Tori was ice water  But it didn't  Make this episode  I guess they thought  It was more fun  To watch me cry  Yeah  Watch ice water 
[02:48:00]  Drip on Tori's head  And it was high too  Right  It drips from high up  I didn't realize that  Yeah  I actually kind of  The worst part is  We were making this  I make torture devices  For myself  How messed up is that  That is pretty sick  Go pick the switch  Off the tree  Kind of thing  How come he's not  Bolted in  Oh because we wanted  To try it  Without being restrained  Because we couldn't  Go through with it  And we wanted to  Just kind of isolate  The water torture  And we put him  In a diaper  So that he'd have  To lay there  For a long time 
[02:48:30]  But I don't know  If you knew this  About adult diapers  But they're not  Like baby diapers  Where they're supposed  To take a full  Thing of pee  It's for a little  Bit of drip  So like  All of a sudden  He had to run  Because he's like  This isn't Holdings  I don't remember  If that was in the episode  Or not  So maybe I shouldn't  Have said that  How does that place  Ever get clean  I was just watching  That poo episode  And it wasn't real poo  That they were using  But there was just  Shit flying all over  The place  And I'm like  There's no way  They're getting everything  There has to be  Just rotting stuff  From five seasons ago 
[02:49:00]  Just hanging around  That warehouse  When I was an intern  My job was to  Scrape the chicken guts  Off the ceiling  After they had rotted  And it's so nice  Now that I have interns  Yeah  Oh my god  Clean out the fridge  Is the worst  That is a good  Clean out the fridge  That's a good feeling  We have  Okay we have two fridges now  Because I used  I put a human skull  In the fridge  Where everybody  Put their lunches  Oh that kind of  And I had made  Like fake brains  And stuff in it  And you know  The experiment went longer  Than we thought  And it started to rot  In there  And apparently 
[02:49:30]  The smell was really bad  And people were getting  The office was getting  Mad at me  They're just like  You can't put a human skull  Next to my sandwich  So we had to get  Two fridges  One for human food  And one for the stuff  That we leave out  And in particular  That banquet  That they made me eat  We kind of stuck that  In the fridge  And then forgot about it  Over the weekend  And then we forgot about it  Over a period of few weeks  And then somebody  Had unplugged the fridge  For sound issues  And we're like  What is that smell?  What is going on?  And so somebody goes  I think it's the fridge  Opens the door  We had to evacuate the shop 
[02:50:00]  Wow, that bad  Yeah, it was like  That scene from Stand By Me  Where everybody's like  It's great to know  Like cleaning the workshop  In Saul  Exactly  Exactly  It's great to know  The same crap happens  Where you work  What?  You have human skulls  In your fridge?  Well, not so much  Human skulls  But just  Yeah, nasty garbage  I would like to play a game  We're going to see  If shit is flammable  What does your husband do? 
[02:50:30]  Is he kind of like  Alpha like you are  Like test limits  Or is he  You know  The corporate guy  He is a tattoo artist  By day  And then on the weekends  He races motorcycles  Yeah, see  That's the type of people  That are attracted to you  Yeah, they both kind of  I have tattoos  In a motorcycle  I think that's illegal  In America  Yeah, but they're hemp  And it's a moped  Oh, Dan 
[02:51:00]  How long are you married?  I was  I've been with him  For a decade  Okay  I've only been married  For about five years  Was it weird for him  Like when you both  Kind of start  Seeing each other  And you're just kind of  Both not in a limelight  And then all of a sudden  His wife or girlfriend  Is now a celebrity  Is that like  Uncomfortable for him  Or is he fine with it?  At first it sucked for him  Because, you know  I go out to places  And all the boys  Were noticing me  A little bit more  And I get creepy emails  And then there'd be  A picture of us  On the internet  From going to an art show  And then all of a sudden 
[02:51:30]  There'd be all these comments  Like, is she dating her dad?  Like just really mean stuff  Dear Carrie  You're going to be in D.C., right?  Yes  I have a hat and glasses  As well as a tattoo  In a motorcycle  Just lifting things  He's used to it now  He's super cool with it  He doesn't worry about it  Is he older than you?  I don't know  Same age  Oh, wow  Okay, they were just being dicks  Real?  Yeah  Oh, yeah, no  They were just being jerks  Oh, wow  I mean, it's the internet  You're 14  You're in your basement  You're angry  There's an outlet  Exactly  I'm looking for you 
[02:52:00]  Most of our fans  Are really nice  And they'll actually  Kind of attack those people  For me  I don't  I never have to respond  I bet you're very defended  As far as  I've got a lot of  Viewers going  I think he actually is  Danny  A few times  Are you, you know  Yes  Fanboy44  He's RP1ST  No, no  I don't  I don't  I don't do the message board thing 
[02:52:30]  Terrible  Picking a creepy  Yeah, that is a creepy name  I fear  He picked that so quickly  I swear  It's got to be his handle  It's got to be his handle  I'm thinking too  It was too fast  He had to have  Jotted that one down  A few times  Do they have chat rooms anymore?  I think that  Oh, yeah  I haven't gone in  In a long time  They used to be fun  But then it's just like  I'm going to get screencapped  Doing this  Yeah  Do you take criticism well? 
[02:53:00]  Uh oh  Yeah, yeah  I do now  You get enough of it  Yeah, you get enough of it  And it's like  At first it's like  You want to hunt them down  And kill them  On that show  They always reference the fact  That the fans  Thought we did it wrong  The fans think that  I mean that must just happen  All day long  Like you have to  When you have to do a new myth  Because some fan said  That you did it wrong  Like there has to be  Some part of you  That just gets angry about it  I actually kind of like it  Because you know  Usually it's a fun thing  To go back and test differently 
[02:53:30]  And it's a lot of interaction  With the audience  And I feel like we have  Kind of a different show  Where we you know  Really talk to our audience  And they help us with stuff  And they give us content  And if a bunch of people  Really want us to do it over  I bet it's not  I bet they're not worded  Like we would think  They would be  I bet it's not like  You know  You fucked that up  You suck  You didn't even use  What you were supposed to  You suck  I'm never watching  The show again  We should have a higher  Caliber of fan than that  It's usually  Oh that's our fans  Sorry  We're just used to 
[02:54:00]  It's worded like  The ONA  ONA fan word in here  You suck  I hate you  You were so much better  Before they brought carry on  Hey  Right  Whatever  Hey douche fuck  Come to Poughkeepsie  And try to do that  Fucking myth  We're gonna do duct tape again  That is one myth  I'll do a thousand times  I love duct tape  That was great  What was the myth  I still thought it was  Stopping that car  Duct tape can do anything  And one of the  The last myth we did  That I really loved 
[02:54:30]  Is that duct tape  Could put a car back together  That was destroyed  So they gave me a car  And they said  Destroy it  Use anything you want  So I had demo saws  I had torches  I had a jaws of life  I brought in the fire department  To like pull the roof off  Just demolish this car  Cut hoses  Stab the tire  And then my co-host  Tori and Grant  Walked in  And I threw them  Some duct tape  And was like  Fix it  It was great  Little did I know  They were gonna make me drive it  Cause that was kind of  Yeah drive the duct taped car 
[02:55:00]  Yeah  But it fixed right  Yeah  I mean it got put back together  And it drove for a while  And I may have driven  A little too fast  Cause my driving  Might have destroyed  A little bit of it  Two wheels were off the ground  At one point  I'm not gonna say anything more  How long have you guys  Been on the air  Seven years  Oh wow  I feel like I've grown up  On the show  Yeah  Kind of have  We've all watched you grow up  Aww  Aww  And how long was the show on  Before you actually became on air  Um 
[02:55:30]  I think about  A year  I was behind the scenes  Oh so you've been on  For that long  Yeah  Okay okay  Cause that's gotta be nerve wracking  A show is popular  And then you come on  Like what if I screw up  Or what if people don't like me  And what if the show fails  Yeah cause the show was  Really gaining popularity  And then they brought like  That's what they had to bring us on  Even though you guys were  Behind the scenes  Yeah  Yeah I guess  To do some of the  Cause initially it was just  To do some of the busy work  You know hey build this  We don't have time  We're doing this  We just didn't make things faster  So they're like  Okay you guys gotta be hosts  Because we gotta crank these shows out  And you know  We were actually 
[02:56:00]  Staying with the science  So if something took  Three days to test  We'd spend three days  Doing it  Three days  Yeah  Most of our myths  Take at least two weeks  We have a regular job  That's like eight to six  Every single day  And sometimes more  So it's pretty intense  It's not like a regular show  Where you just kind of show up  And you film something  It's like no  We actually do all the work  We're doing the welding  We're doing  Yeah and then there's  The filming of the show part  Yeah  But before that  I guess all the welding  And watching the science 
[02:56:30]  And making sure  You did things right  Yeah  And that place is still  A business too  I mean that's Jamie's place  Right so  We've got two shops now  Jamie's got his business  At M5  And then we've got  A second shop  That my team works out of  What was like  The coolest stuff  That each of them  Adam and Jamie  Worked on  As far as movies go  In the past  Star Wars  Star Wars right  Yeah Grant too  I think right  Yeah Grant  They all worked on Star Wars  Which one  Cool is that  The boys are  You know Grant and Tori  They're quite young  So there's no way  They're going to work 
[02:57:00]  On the first one  They saw the first one  When they were little kids  So they grew up  And you know  Somebody came to Grant  And said hey  Would you like to  Drive R2-D2  Really  Holy shit  He must have wet his pants  Because he's a big fan  I'm wetting my pants  Right now  Why you like Star Wars  I love it so much  Jesus Joel  You don't like anything  Jimmy  I like Star Wars  I think it was a good movie  Oh well what  Why are you going to  Trash me  I'm not going to  Trash you  George Lucas  Because you're a fanboy  Because they started to 
[02:57:30]  Oh I'm like what's  Happening in the room  Right now  I'm like what's happening  I'm the fanboy  I'm like a fucking movie  But I'm saying  Because the Ewoks  No look  There are elements  There are elements  The Ewoks  In the third one  It was all about  Marketing toys to children  After a while  It started to suck  There are elements  Of Star Wars  That I don't care for  But for your advice  The only reason  They were Ewoks  Was because it was  Supposed to be  A planet of Wookiees  But they used the Wookiee  With Chewbacca  In the first film  So he goes 
[02:58:00]  Well let's just make  Them little Wookiees  Exactly  Another toy  That we can market  That's cute  That's great  Space drama  It stinks  It's your Ewok  In the movie for you  Joe  Jim's Ewok impression  Jim's Ewok impression  Is the same noise  You make for sucking  Cock in your act  Jesus  Oh man  We got to see  The movie here  Just messed up  The whole interview  Was it too much  I should just  Cover your mouth  And everything  I'm sorry 
[02:58:30]  Watch your language  I'd like to remind you  I host a kids show  She hosts a kids show  He's not here every day  So don't pay attention  He's some fucking  Local comedian  That needs a gig  Plus  This is his last  Appearance on this show  Oh yeah  The minute I walk out of the room  I know this is going to go  Thanks a lot  Joe  Thanks a lot  I'd rather bring back Mercurio  He's the guy that got us fired 
[02:59:00]  Oh my  And we'd rather have him  Didn't I get it?  I did like in the original Star Wars though  I thought the Cantina band scene  Was very realistic  Oh now that was  Boo  Boo  What?  Boo  What?  That's terrible  Oh my  Do you realize  There's probably  Just like a bunch of nerds  Out front right now  That are in costume  That are just like  Calling for your head  They would agree with me  They know it stinks  That stupid elephant  Terrible  Terrible  Lucas and his weak chin  Terrible  I don't know if that's really 
[02:59:30]  An adversary  You'd like to  Go up against  I liked the movie  I thought it was a really good movie  But those elements of it  Made me hate him  Because like  They were such great movies  And then they throw in like  This took the realism though  Of space  It took it out of like  The hands of just these  Technical astronaut people  To people that went to bars  And hung out  And they had to make it alien  What was it supposed to do?  Put the pips up there?  I just didn't like pips  I didn't think the puppets  Were very good  I didn't think of anyone else  I thought it was funny  I mean  When this came out  It was pretty revolutionary 
[03:00:00]  I mean  Looking at it by today's standards  Is totally different  But looking at it back then  It was crazy  Look he's got an  Ozzy Osbourne shirt on  It tells you what time  He comes from  Exactly  The same time that came out  They mapped his DNA  I actually want to have  My DNA mapped  I'm hoping I'm related  To him somehow  Great would that be  For me and not him  Joe you want to defend  The movies now?  Huh?  You want to defend them?  I was just going to say  Or that scene?  You can't trash Star Wars  But also own the new  Ozzy Osbourne record  Sure you can  Why not?  I don't think it's fair  Why at least it's adult stuff 
[03:00:30]  It's not childish  Come on  You've got to admit  That's catchy  You still know the team  It is true  But you know  I remember a lot of things  From childhood  That weren't good  This is one of them  Would you prefer  That they'd be playing  Ozzy?  Yay  Yeah  I think what you do  Is you mute the movie  Put on your own soundtrack  And you watch it again  Put some Ozzy  In the background  Yeah right?  I just  I love you  Hans trying to make  A deal for a ship  Come on  I'm playing Warpigs  In the bar for you  Jimmy  Darth Vader's one of 
[03:01:00]  The greatest bad guys ever  Ever  One of the greatest villains  Ever  The whole movie  The greatest  Maybe yeah  I mean I would probably  Take Dracula over him  But I mean I do like  Darth Vader  Don't stop  Dracula would be  Silling in space  Yeah that's true  He'd float away  Nobody's scared  Darth Vader's the best voice too  He's the best voice  He does yes  Who Dracula or Darth Vader?  Darth Vader  James Earl Jones  I mean it's amazing  This is CNN  Same guy  Is that him?  Yeah  I didn't know that  Darth Vader  David Prowse  The body of Darth Vader  We've talked many times  Did you ever see 
[03:01:30]  Clockwork Orange?  Yes  The big bodybuilder  That carries him  Down the steps  In the wheelchair  That's Darth Vader  That's the guy  That was in the costume  I didn't know that  Yes that's Darth Vader  That's the guy  In the costume  British bodybuilder  Hey we got a lot of fans  Checking in  I just want to take one  From Bill in Philly  I don't want to talk  To the fans  Hello Bill  Not you  Hello fellas  Opie follow me  Carrie  No  Yeah  I'm afraid to ask  This after what Danny  Just did  But have you ever  Considered redoing  The baseball myth?  Which one?  Okay  What you guys did was  You're seeing if it's  Faster sliding or running 
[03:02:00]  And you did it  In the second base  The real myth  Is if it's faster  To slide or run  Through first base  Well I will bring that  Back and suggest it to him  That's kind of what we do  So  The difference is you can  Overrun first base  You can't overrun second  Or third  So that's why  It's probably faster  You're always going to be  Slowing down going into it  First you just keep on running  Right so I would say  The sliding is slower  But it's a necessity  So you don't run  Into left field  I've seen people do it  Yeah  I don't know if it's faster  But I've seen people do it  To evade a tag  Sliding into first is slower 
[03:02:30]  In baseball  The announcers say  Oh it's slower to slide  But players still do it  I say that a lot actually  On dates  So what happened?  I'll just talk to a girl  That's sliding into first  And she just gets on  Danny  What's that?  Yes sir  Jimmy's doing better than you  What are you going to do?  Well and Ed's trying real hard too  We're not trying real hard  Danny's asking very  She's a lovely girl  She's married as a kid  She's beautiful  But I appreciate  That she came here  Let Danny ask a question  Danny it's your turn 
[03:03:00]  I'm being very childish  Danny's asking good questions  Can I  You have to cheat  Can I have something  From your purse  From your personal belongings  No  I might have a bottle  Of Purell you can have  I'll have it  Oh there you go  Just let me use some  Of it before I leave  After she uses it  Exactly  Yeah but then it'll be  Worth more to them  If you use it  Before you give it to them  So that makes sense  Those are great boots  By the way  She has one of the sexiest boots  They're like leg high  Like middle of the  Higher than the knee boots  Yeah describe them  We didn't see them  When she came in  You didn't 
[03:03:30]  But a lot of people  Out there listening  Didn't  Screw the audience  I'm trying to let  The radio land  I'm a big fan  Of leather boots  I love the lace up ones  That go up to your knees  They protect you  They're the best  So I guess you're  A vegetarian for health reasons  Not for this kind of  You know  No animals  I just  Don't like it  Were you  For your whole life  You were a vegetarian  Since I was 15  And it's sort of like  If I go back now  I'll be sick  Yeah you probably  Will be sick  I know  Are you hardcore though  What do you mean by hardcore  I don't know  What's the difference  Is totally vegan 
[03:04:00]  Where there's no  I'm from San Francisco  So there's so many variations  Like there's pescan  Pescatarian  All that kind of stuff  So I eat cheese  Pretty basic  Okay that's good  My husband's from the south  So we have to  Have some  Pain in the ass  We're all forgetting  You can't find a friggin restaurant  To eat in  There's something to eat  At every single restaurant  In San Francisco maybe  No everywhere  Yeah  Everybody makes pasta  My girlfriend used to get  So mad at me  When I would open the menu  And the first thing  I would do is go 
[03:04:30]  Hey they have this  Like I'd point out  Stuff that she could eat  Yeah yeah yeah  And it's like  I can read the menu  And it's like  Well I don't want to  Pick out what I want  And then find out  You can't eat here  And then have to leave  Because then I'll be like  No I want that  And I feel your pain  It's tough to find  A good restaurant in Manhattan  No Joe  There's plenty of  Oh Jim  I actually  It might just be  Laziness  But I kind of like  Having less options  Because you know  What you want right away  And I kind of like  Getting my food  Can you eat the same thing 
[03:05:00]  Like day after day sometimes  Sometimes I do  I eat Clif Bars  Just all the time  They're great  I don't have a lot of time  It seems  So I just  I live on those things  Yeah  How many hours a day  Are you actually working  And the apricot one  Amazing  I work usually  Eight to six  On Mythbusters  But then  Eight to six  Yeah  That's a long day  Carrie can I ask you a question  We were supposed to bring up  Over here  Over here  The one that's not talking about  I gotcha  We have a hockey question  That maybe you guys 
[03:05:30]  Want to take on  You know how guys  Oh right  Well the hockey fights  Yeah  I'm convinced that  They don't punch as hard  Because they can't get  Traction on the ice  Oh the every action  I don't know  If it's a reaction  That's interesting  Less friction on a skate  I don't know if it's enough  To do a whole thing on it  But as a scientist  Type person  What do you think  I think that would be  A great one to test  I don't  I think the force of the punch  Is not going to be as hard  Because you're actually  You have less friction  Between your foot  And the ground  And then a blade  And ice 
[03:06:00]  I think you slide  Slightly at least  But can't they come  To a complete stop  Yes they can  There's not a lot of ice  Where I am  I don't know a lot  About hockey  But can't they really  Grip into the ice  With those skates  Like they're not  Well that's why  You gotta do it  A couple different ways  Yeah so I'm thinking  That it just depends  On the guy  And it depends on his skill  You can thank me later  But there you go  There's an episode  I'll put that  In the sports myth bin  And we'll try that later  Sports myth bin  It'll never see  The light of day  There's probably  A million of those  How much dumb ideas  Is this Carrie  We have a lot of them  On the board  And I swear 
[03:06:30]  There's a lot of sports myth  And we do themes  Quite often  They're kind of  More of our audience themes  Like ninjas or pirates  But we definitely  Do sports ones as well  What's the best sports myth  Mythbusters did  Danny or Carrie  Well let's ask you  You probably watched it  More than I did  The best sports myth  Yeah I'm thinking now  I mean  I got like seven years  To troll through  Baseball myths  We did whether it's  If you can hit a home run  Easier in humid climate  Because you have humid balls  I remember one  Yes  What curveball  Whether or not it was possible 
[03:07:00]  To actually smack the leather  Off of a baseball  By hitting it hard  Yeah  Oh come on  That's silly  Was it  Why  You can right  Well how hard  Well you'd have  Technically yeah  But I think  You need it like  The pitch would have  To be coming in  At like 200 miles an hour  There was a whole bunch  Of catalyst involved  That it was just beyond  What a human person  Which is what makes  Mythbusters really good too  It's not like  It's just like  Okay that didn't work  Let's move on  It's like okay  Let's see what it would take  To make that happen  Yeah that's the fun part  Whether it takes more dynamite 
[03:07:30]  Or it takes  Hitting something  At 200 miles an hour  Instead of 60  Or Robert Redford  That's all it takes  Robert Redford  That's all it takes  Yeah he  He never knocked  The cover off  That was from  The Sandlot  No the natural  Doesn't he knock  The leather off the ball  In the natural  No he hit the lights  And broke the lights  Why don't you shut up  Joe DeRosa  You stupid Star Wars  Exactly  Stop talking about  Men you find dreamy  We really don't like  Joe at all  Dreamy  Oh guys  It's so crazy 
[03:08:00]  How about that hunk  Who directed  Ordinary People  I have a question  Yeah  Will there ever be  Any Mythbusters episode  Pertaining to  9-11 myths  You know  Conspiracy myths  Come in a lot  I find that one  A little touchy  Yeah I can see  How it could be  Why don't you  Just leave that to me  Yeah well  There's people like that  That say  Oh that's why  They don't do it  Because you know  It would prove  The truth  There is  You know  Why don't they  Should do something  About this  That would be a huge episode  The steal 
[03:08:30]  Because people do  Respect those guys  They're pretty thorough  You're never changing  Anyone's mind  I know that  That's the one thing  About conspiracies  Like no matter  What you show them  It's the agenda  It's not the truth  Right  And it's not as fun  You know  It's like based  In horrid tragedy  It is still an interesting  Thing though  Most of our myths are  Yeah  What are they getting  Sucked through a plane  By your anus  Is  I don't think  I saw it  Didn't that  They tested on the  Well they 
[03:09:00]  Did shoot  Through a pressurized  Cabin  Yeah really  They made a meat  They made a man of meat  And put him down  In one of those  Old school diving suits  Yeah yeah  And then like  Sucked him up  Through the hose  Yeah and then cut the hose  And like you know  He just basically  You know from the  From the pressure  Just kind of  Got sucked out  Like squaw  Squaw was out  Of the suit  It was disgusting  Yeah  That was some sick stuff  The pressure was cut out  Yeah yeah yeah  Well so you know  That's based in  Let him tell you  He probably washed it more  I wasn't  She wasn't around  For that one 
[03:09:30]  That was when she was  On maternity  I bet you Danny  Knows more about  Mythbusters than Carrie  We should do a little  I guarantee it  I don't even want  To do a quiz  Because some of those  Things like  Think about it  I did it seven years ago  And he probably  Watched the episode  Five times  I just did it  Five  What were you doing  Seven years ago  On a Monday in January  You know  Like that's  I was watching you  On television  Yeah  Hey by the way  Joe was right  About what  I hate to say it  About the bald thing  Yeah it  Yeah it happens  It was the beginning 
[03:10:00]  Of the movie supposedly  Oh who cares  I never watched it  Exactly  But we beat the shit  Out of you  For no reason  And you took it  And just  It was really quiet  What a surprise  That I got tossed  Under the bus  For something that was true  So how has the internet  Changed your job  Because it seems like  You can check facts  Right away  Is it totally different  Than when you started  It made us seem  A lot smarter than we are  Because people ask questions  And you can just  Punch it up  We can google  And then there's  Things like this  Like video conferencing  Things  Are you video conferencing  While you're talking to me 
[03:10:30]  Yeah yeah  Like people  Well I'm not  Not when I'm talking to you  But some guests  I never even look them  In the face  I just sit here  And type how bad  The guest was  Yeah  Oh my god  None of the guests  That are listening  It wasn't you  I'm gonna have to check  With my fans  What you're doing right now  Oh believe me  I  There's not a  You can check everything  There's not a peep on here  Usually though  I'm like  Oh my god  Can we please wrap this up  This guest sucks  God  Yeah no  His name is DeRosa  What is  What did I do  That I'm getting 
[03:11:00]  A shellac  And all of a sudden  You're not a cute redhead  Exactly  And we don't like  Your slacks  What did you do  You were born  Your slacks  God  They're  Oh  God damn it  I don't want to get  Back on the couch  No the couch is a bad place  Joe could you stand up  And show her  That you have no shoulders  They might be able  To do a myth on that  Do a myth by  They might be able  To do a myth on that  Can a man actually  Live without shoulders  A man who will  Never be general  I say it's plausible  Could you actually put  Shoulder pads on a guy  That doesn't have shoulders  Could you show her  At least Joe 
[03:11:30]  I'm feeling bad for him  Turn around  You'll never see this  Again in your life  Look at these  What did I do  What did I do  You were born  Oh my god  It's getting  Terrible  It feels really bad  Back here right now  They haven't brought up  The little paper  I feel like  Yeah the dunce cap  For them  I feel like the dog  You throw fireworks at  While it's tied to the tree  They can't do anything  What you did was  You attacked our guest  I did not attack the guest  So now we're attacking you  We didn't like this  We didn't like it at all 
[03:12:00]  We just didn't like it  We don't like it  We didn't like it  She put her hand over her mouth  She was just shocked by you  By your language  Yeah  Now we beat you up  I'm very dirty  And I've used appropriate language  And you still haven't apologized to her  For your potty mouth  Had I been told  That we weren't allowed  To say such things  Oh excuse before the apologies  That always works  Maybe you could feel it out  With a certain guest  And know and use common sense  That you know  And by the way  I was making fun of Jim  I wasn't making fun of the guest  She said oh my  Good apology  Yeah so far  Very contrived 
[03:12:30]  I accept  Thank you  She's so uncomfortable  Thank you  What are you doing  Like touring around the country  Just kind of  Pushing the show  And everything  Or are you in New York  For a reason  I just happen to be  In Washington D.C.  For the science  It's an engineering festival  So I was real close to New York  And I had a few days  Before I go do  The math teachers conference  In New Orleans  So I thought  Hey let's come  Check this place out  And you guys called  So I'm here  I'm not pushing anything  Oh great 
[03:13:00]  That's really cool  I like the fact  That you're just  Popping in like that  Were you in New York a lot  Or  No not enough  Danny  I love New York  Yeah  I love it  Danny was in New York  There's so many cool  Are you here with your husband  I guess right  No  You want to go to dinner  Watch it  There's a great place  That I know  It's fantastic  Actually in the meatpacking district  I know  A cop down there  It doesn't matter  It's a meatpacking district  They pack vegetables too  They pack meat or anything like that 
[03:13:30]  Isn't that the hip place  It is  Yeah  It's the place to be  Used to be  Not anymore  But I know a lot of  People down there  And I know  A law enforcement officer  That takes care of everything  And can get in  Anywhere  He's a scumbag  Don't go to dinner with him  I think I'm actually  Going to dinner tonight  With the guys  From Popular Mechanics  Anthony has Popular Mechanics  At his  I know  At my house  At his house  I love it  It's great  It is great  Toilet reading  Or airplane 
[03:14:00]  Or airplane toilet  If you want to see  Who reads in the airplane toilet  That's disgusting  Yeah  I know  I would never  I don't even like going in there  I like to annoy the other passengers  And bring the Sunday Times in  They know it's going to be a lot  If I saw you heading there  I would hold it  I don't know  They know it's going to  It's going to be a Lulu  That's terrible  Oh the guys from Popular Mechanics  Yeah  That's pretty cool  Isn't that nice  Just talk about  Popular things  And mechanical things 
[03:14:30]  No Popular Mechanics  Actually there's two mechanics  That she knows  They have a lot of friends  She's going out to dinner  With Jesse James  They have a lot of friends  Yes  Popular  I apologize for saying the C word  While Anthony insults  All your friends  And tries to convince you  To commit adultery  Right now  Sorry  I was out of line  I would have just went  Honestly  I just would have  Went on a nice dinner  And that  And then goodnight  Exactly  It wouldn't have been anything  It's just 
[03:15:00]  I think we  Have a lot in common  As far as our interests go  Things like that  As far as  What I can see here  And what I've seen on television  No reason to attack Joe though  I don't have to attack Joe  There's no reason  I'm matching socks and shirt  They get a little bit of a roll with that  That's what you're supposed to do  When you're in San Francisco  I'll be there in like March  So if you want to come to the show  You can probably come to the show  I'll take you out to dinner  Thank you  I can take you places  Where they have steak  That would be nice  Yeah  There you go  She's going to take you out to dinner 
[03:15:30]  I'm a very good dinner companion  I have excellent table manners  You know who got  Tori has an in at every restaurant  Oh good  Yeah  He's Italian and everybody's his cousin  Yeah go with him Jimmy  So he can take us anywhere in town  Us  You ever been to Massapequa?  Yeah  That's some great diners  Long Island  Exactly  Maybe you can go to where Ron Kovitz is making burgers with a hole in them  Call back for that movie  I don't know what you're talking about  It was Born on the 4th of July  Oh 
[03:16:00]  Tom Cruise's best movie I think  No  Best performance  It was a pretty good movie  Yeah  When was he better than Tom Boren  He should have won the Oscar for that  I agree  Tropic Thunder  This is his best role  You can't just be fond of Top Gun  Not a bad role  No  Cause that's  I mean  Nah but it's like  I watched it for other reasons  Top Gun?  Yeah  What other reasons?
